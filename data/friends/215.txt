Chandler: So, you and 
                            Rachel tonight, uh?
Joey: Yeah. It's actually 
                            our first official date 
Chandler: Wow! So tonight 
                            may be the night! You're nervous?
Joey: Naa, no. This is 
                            the part I'm actually good at.
Chandler: What must it 
                            be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
Joey: (pause) It's OK!
Chandler: How can you 
                            be so confident?
Joey: Well, I... I know 
                            exactly what I'm gonna do!
Chandler: Really? Like 
                            you have a routine?
Joey: No, no no no no. 
                            See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate 
                            their uniqueness.
Chandler: Really?
Joey: No, I do six things! 
                            First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. 
                            Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
Chandler: You mean like 
                            this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and 
                            awkard way)
Joey: NO! Not like that, 
                            no no. No, like this. (He starts lightly grazing Chandler's 
                            thigh)
Chandler: Oh, I see what 
                            you mean, that's quite nice. (They look at each other, 
                            both embarassed)
Joey: More foosball?
Chandler: ...and beer!!
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Monica: (to Chandler) 
                            Hey sweetie! (they kiss)
Ross: (looking at Monica's 
                            legs) WOW!
Chandler: Hey! Stop staring 
                            at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's 
                            legs!
Ross: I'm sorry, it's 
                            just... how did you get so tan?
Chandler: She went on 
                            one of those spray-on tan places.
Ross: Eh, you got a spray-on 
                            tan?
Monica: Chandler gets 
                            pedicures!
Ross: (laughing) Why, 
                            why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
Chandler: (To Monica) 
                            Why...why?
Ross: Still, I can't 
                            believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really 
                            good. I wonder if I should get one!
Chandler: Sure, then 
                            you should get a mini skirt so you can really show 
                            it off.
Ross: So, do you get 
                            colours or just French tips?
Monica: There. Here's 
                            their card.
Ross: Thanks. (he takes 
                            the card) Hey, I know where this place is! It used 
                            to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes 
                            what he is saying) florist. (he goes away)
Phoebe: Hey!
Chandler: Hey Pheebs!
Monica: Hey Phoebe!
Phoebe: Oh, you won't 
                            believe who moved back to town.
Monica: I know, Amanda! 
                            Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!
Chandler: Who's Amanda?
Monica: She's this girl 
                            who used to live in the building before you did. Then 
                            she moved to England and she picked up this fake British 
                            accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes 
                            Amanda using an awful British accent) "Monica, 
                            darling! It's Amanda calling!"
Chandler: Are you trying 
                            to do a British accent?
Monica: (pause) (to Phoebe) 
                            Chandler gets pedicures!
Chandler: Just so I know, 
                            how many more of those can I expect?
Phoebe: You know what 
                            Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes 
                            Amanda in a british accent) "Oh, so sorry to 
                            catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna 
                            get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
Monica: I know, and she's 
                            always bragging about all the famous people she's 
                            met.
Phoebe: Oh, I know! "Oh...I 
                            slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
Monica: Oh, what are 
                            we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!
Phoebe: Ugh, Let's just 
                            cut her out!
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Cut her out of 
                            our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till 
                            she gets the point!
Monica: Oh, I guess we 
                            could try that, but... it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) 
                            Have you ever done that?
Chandler: No, had it 
                            done to me though. Feels good !
Ross: Well... I like 
                            how you look, what are you?
Assistant: Puerto Rican.
Ross: Two, I think a 
                            two.
Assistant: You've got 
                            to face the red light. When the red light goes on 
                            the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. 
                            When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself 
                            down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can 
                            get your back. Got it?
Ross: Spray, count, pat, 
                            then turn, spray, count and pat.
Assistant: Wow, you catch 
                            on quick.
Ross: Well, I have a 
                            PhD, so... (assistant walk out, not impressed by this 
                            statement)
                            (Ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning 
                            booth. He stands up in front of the red light and 
                            the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso)
Ross: One Mississipi, 
                            two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer starts again, 
                            spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! 
                            I'm not-I've not finished counting!! (he leaves the 
                            booth) (the assistant enters the room)
Ross: You sprayed my 
                            front twice!
Assistant: You've never 
                            turned?
Assistant: Mississippi? 
                            I said count to five'!
Ross: Mississippilesly? 
                            (pause) Well, how bad is it?
Assistant: Ain't that 
                            bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next 
                            four hours.
Ross: So, how dark is 
                            it gonna get?
Assistant: You got sprayed 
                            with two two' s and...
Ross: I'm a four?
Assistant: Yeah, but 
                            you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that 
                            out.
Ross: (sarcastically) 
                            Really!
Assistant: You might 
                            wanna get back in there.
Ross: (annoyed) Ok!
Ross: Wait, wait a minute, 
                            there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when 
                            it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns and the 
                            spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, 
                            but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front 
                            again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on 
                            tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same 
                            thing happened again!
Assistant: You got two 
                            more twos?
Ross: (hysterically) 
                            I'm an eight!
Rachel: So.
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Hey what do you 
                            say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
Rachel: Ok, so sorry.
Joey: Ok.
Joey: (a little giddy) 
                            Uh, was that good for you?
Phoebe: Oh, yeah. Could 
                            be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
Monica: It could be Amanda!
Monica: You're from Yonkers! 
                            Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
Chandler: Hello? Is someone 
                            on the line?
Amanda: Yes, I was looking 
                            for Monica.
Chandler: (to Amanda) 
                            I get pedicures!
Phoebe: (leaving) Fine, 
                            fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
Monica: And you would?
Phoebe: I did!
Joey: Ok. Well, how, 
                            how can we make it easier?
Joey: Ok, yeah, got it.
Joey: This thing welded 
                            shut?!
Rachel: Okay.
Joey: All right, turn 
                            around, I got to get a look at this thing.
Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: Ow!
Joey: Sorry!
Rachel: Well this is 
                            romantic!
Joey: I'm sorry! (He 
                            stands up) This never happened to me before! I'm an 
                            expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! 
                            I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked 
                            at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
Joey: Then I blame you! 
                            Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your 
                            slapping!
Rachel: Ok well, well 
                            I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you 
                            think that maybe on some level, you don't want to 
                            take off my bra?
Joey: (contemplates for 
                            a few moments what Rachel just said) NAH! I don't 
                            have another level!! 
Ross: I went to that 
                            tanning place your wife suggested.
Chandler: Was that place... 
                            The Sun?
Ross: Oh! And it gets 
                            worse! (Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and 
                            pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across 
                            his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back 
                            is very pale.)
Chandler: Oh My God! 
                            You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
Monica: How could you 
                            mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, 
                            you count to five and you turn around!!
Ross: (looks at her suspiciously) 
                            How do you count to five?
Monica: One Two Three...
Ross: (Yells) Damnit! 
                            (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel just enters, sees 
                            him and starts laughing)
Rachel: (laughing) oooh! 
                            Oh oh!
Ross: (Still yelling) 
                            I Know!
Rachel: oh oh! What is 
                            up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
Chandler: How was your 
                            date with Joey?
Rachel: Well, it was 
                            good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then 
                            we were fooling around and he started to put his hand 
                            up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
Chandler: You didn't 
                            like that?
Rachel: Well, it wasn't 
                            just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't 
                            even undo my bra!
Monica: Wow, really? 
                            One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Rachel: I do not know 
                            what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before 
                            and that's been great! But this time it was leading 
                            somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it 
                            was Joey touching me.
Monica: Well, you guys 
                            have been friends forever. Remember the first time 
                            that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't 
                            stop laughing? You got through that.
Rachel: (looking thoughtful) 
                            Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're 
                            right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna 
                            power through!
Joey: Hey Chandler can 
                            I talk to you for a second (points to the hall).
Rachel: (To Joey) No 
                            need!! Problem solved, we are powering through (At 
                            which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back 
                            to their apartment).
Monica: (sees what he 
                            is doing) Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!
Chandler: (without taking 
                            his eyes off the bra) You don't know! (Monica just 
                            smiles)
Monica: Hey Phoebe!
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Is Amanda here 
                            yet?
Phoebe: No.
Monica: (sits down) Oh 
                            good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that 
                            cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler 
                            agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Phoebe: Oh! Well, what 
                            kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
Monica: Well, what do 
                            you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?
Phoebe: (makes a face) 
                            Are you kidding, I love it!
Phoebe: Hi!
Monica: Hi!
Amanda: Hi! (Phoebe and 
                            Amanda hug)
Amanda: (To Monica) Hello!
Amanda: (In a fake British 
                            accent) It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look 
                            at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica 
                            as well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! 
                            But first things first: touch my abs (at which point 
                            she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places 
                            them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! 
                            (she pulls them down to sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, 
                            you're married!
Monica: (beaming) Yeah! 
                            Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
Amanda: (To Phoebe) Smell 
                            my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's not perfume! It's me! 
                            It's my natural scent!
Phoebe: Musty!
Amanda: Oh! Gosh! This 
                            is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm 
                            so happy you two are friends again!
Monica: When were we 
                            not friends?
Amanda: Well, it was 
                            1992, and I remember because that was the year I had 
                            sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly).
Monica: Ehm, we were 
                            friends in 1992.
Amanda: (to Phoebe) No 
                            I distinctly remember you were dodging her (points 
                            at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her. 
Monica: (To Phoebe) You 
                            were going to cut me out?
Phoebe: Well...kinda.
Monica: Oh My God!
Amanda: Oh! Bugger. Should 
                            I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!
Phoebe: Yeah well, in 
                            America you're just an "ass".
Monica: (Into the phone) 
                            Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my 
                            God, are you alright? (listens some more) Yeah, I'll 
                            be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) 
                            I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. 
                            (She gets up)
Phoebe: (Also gets up 
                            and starts taking her purse) Oh my God. Was Mike with 
                            him?
Monica: Nope! (She turns 
                            and leaves)
Joey: (To Rachel) Hey!
Rachel: Hey! Got champagne?
Joey: Yes ma'am, ready 
                            to Power through!
Rachel: Excellent! Stick 
                            it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and 
                            in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove 
                            her bra from under her clothes)...
Joey: Uh! (When she's 
                            done she throws her bra at him) 
Rachel: Ok (starts to 
                            light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (Claps 
                            her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) 
                            Alright! Lets do it!
Joey: Ok, you're scaring 
                            me a little bit.
Rachel: Oh! Get over 
                            it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She pulls him towards 
                            her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! 
                            You like that huh?
Joey: Oh! yeah!
Rachel: You like that? 
                            (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting 
                            her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into 
                            high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat 
                            reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs 
                            and begins to kiss his neck.)
Joey: uh uh!
Rachel: Yeah baby, I'll 
                            show you how we do it!
Joey: No, no, no! You 
                            kneed me in my misters!
Rachel: What? Oh my God! 
                            I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
Joey: (He just sits there, 
                            legs very close together with a painful look on his 
                            face) Soldier down!
Monica: We are not friends 
                            with Phoebe anymore.
Chandler: If she asks, 
                            I protested a little, but ok!
Phoebe: Oh Chandler! 
                            Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you 
                            outside for a minute?
Monica: I have nothing 
                            to say to you.
Amanda: (announces more 
                            to herself than anyone else) Wow, my flat is twice 
                            this size!
Phoebe: Please, Monica? 
                            In the hall?
Amanda: Ooh, that accident 
                            must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.
Chandler: Well, aren't 
                            you a treat.
Monica: I can't believe 
                            you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?
Phoebe: It was right 
                            after we were living together and you were driving 
                            me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive 
                            and shrill.
Monica: I'm still all 
                            those things!
Phoebe: You're also so 
                            generous and kind and scrappy!
Monica: (starts smiling) 
                            I am scrappy.
Phoebe: Exactly! Look, 
                            no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you 
                            out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, 
                            you were the only one who ever clawed her way back 
                            in.
Monica: It's because 
                            I'm scrappy.
Phoebe: Yeah, you are. 
                            And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, 
                            because I don't know what I would do without you.
Monica: I won't know 
                            what I would do without you.
Monica: Well, I guess 
                            we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, 
                            I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Phoebe: Yeah, I guess 
                            you're right.
Amanda: Can you believe 
                            it. I've never had any professional dance training.
Glenda: Now, let me explain 
                            how this works. You go into the booth, and...
Ross: I'm gonna stop 
                            you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this 
                            is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I 
                            want them all on my back.
Glenda: (quietly) Okay...
Ross: Wait a minute, 
                            there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
Ross: Which... which... 
                            which... Which one is it?
Ross: OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Rachel: What is the matter 
                            with us?
Joey: Well, I know what's 
                            the matter with me.
Rachel: No, I mean with 
                            us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... 
                            difficult?
Joey: I don't know.
Chandler: That fake British 
                            woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
Rachel: Hi! Hey, listen, 
                            can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first 
                            hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more 
                            than that?
Chandler: Kinda... you 
                            know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
Rachel: No, no, no... 
                            No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Joey: Yeah, was there 
                            a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
Chandler: Actually, no. 
                            No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I 
                            can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole 
                            time.
Chandler: I can tell 
                            from your expressions that that's the good news you 
                            were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... 
                            spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey 
                            sighs)
Rachel: Well, just because 
                            it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has 
                            to happen that way for us.
Joey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. 
                            I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't 
                            mean that you quit.
Rachel: Right, totally.
Joey: Yeah, so we just 
                            keep trying and trying until we... do it.
Rachel: Yeah, and if 
                            doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples 
                            that never have sex.
Joey: That's a... pla-an.
Joey: (sighs) Wow... 
                            I did not see this coming.
Rachel: I know.
Joey: I don't get it. 
                            I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted. 
Rachel: Hmmm... Me too...
Rachel: I wonder how 
                            Monica and Chandler could do it?
Joey: I guess they weren't 
                            as good friends as we are.
Rachel: Aah... I bet 
                            you're right.
Joey: So...
Rachel: Yeah.
Joey: I love ya.
Rachel: Love you too... 
                            Alright, I'm going to bed.
Joey: Yeah, me too.
Joey: Ooh, yeah, I'm 
                            not going anywhere for a while.
Chandler: Dude, it's 
                            Chandler. Let me in.
Ross: Go away! I don't 
                            want to see anybody.
Chandler: I know, I went 
                            to the tanning place and the same thing happened to 
                            me. You have to let me in.
Ross: Really? Did you 
                            count Mississipily?
Ross: Dude, you're not 
                            tanned.
Chandler: No, I just 
                            had to get a picture of this.
Chandler: I see you later!
