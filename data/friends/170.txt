Tim: I like your necklace.
Phoebe: I made it myself.
Tim: You are so talented.
Chandler: You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I

Kash.)
Kash: Bye.
Rachel: Say hi to Wally.
Phoebe: Ooh Monica!
Monica: Hi!
Phoebe: But why?!
Monica: Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
Phoebe: But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another
chance? Please?
Monica: (thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he
is out of there!
Monica: I paid to have this done.
Phoebe: Love it!
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Joey: Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought
you were charming.
Rachel: I thought I was a complete idiot.
Joey: I said no.
Rachel: What?!

he say when you told him I was pregnant?

Chandler: What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around
here?!
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!

him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
Monica: Why not?!
Monica: What?! You said he was sweet!
Monica: What do you mean?
Monica: I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.

Ross: You set her up?!
Joey: No
Ross: Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Ross: A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous
those are?!
Joey: Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like
five miles an hour?
Kash: Hey Joey.
Joey: Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
Kash: Hey.
Kash: Yeah.
Ross: A bit of a daredevil are we?
Kash: Hey Rachel! You ready to go?
Ross: Okay. Have a great time you guys.
Rachel: Thank you.
Kash: Thank you.
Ross: Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the
entire sentence.)
Tim: (walks behind Phoebe) Hi! (And startles her.)
Phoebe: Hi.
Ross: Books?
Joey: And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
Joey: Dude! What is going on?!
Joey: Why?
Joey: Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
Joey: What do you mean?
Joey: Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your
