Rachel: 
                            You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her 
                            first cookie.
Joey: Her first cookie? 
                            She has cookies all the time!
Rachel: I've never 
                            given her a cookie. Have you?
Joey: No! No... and, 
                            for the record, I've also never given her a frosting 
                            from a can!
Monica: Hey Rach, the 
                            adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and 
                            we were wondering if you would write one for us.
Rachel: Of course, 
                            I'd be honored!
Chandler: Thanks!
Monica: Thank you!
Joey: U-U-Um, I think 
                            there's been an oversight.
Chandler: Joey, we 
                            would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be 
                            interested.
Monica: Yeah, it's 
                            just we don't think of you as really being so much 
                            "with the words".
Joey: Whoo-weh hey 
                            weh-hey whoo hey!!
Monica: Clearly 
                            we were wrong.
Joey: I gotta a lot 
                            of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know 
                            how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would 
                            love to help you get one.
Monica: You know what? 
                            Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Joey: Thank you! Alright, 
                            let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby 
                            adoption decider people..."
Chandler: So 
                            excited about your letter!
Phoebe: Hey!
All: Hey Phoebe!
Joey: Hey!
Monica: Wow! Don't 
                            you look nice?!
Phoebe: Yes, I do! 
                            Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
Rachel: OH! What's 
                            it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first 
                            kiss, first time you had sex...
Phoebe: YEAH!
Chandler: So you must 
                            be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
Phoebe: Uh-uh. Ehm, 
                            a Knicks game.
Joey: Uhm... Aren't 
                            you a little overdressed?
Phoebe: Hey, you know 
                            what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, 
                            so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy 
                            pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and 
                            we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
Monica: You guys do 
                            that? Chandler won't even have sex in our 
                            bathroom!
Chandler: That's where 
                            people make number two!!
Charlie: Hey! (They 
                            kiss and cuddle a little)
Ross: Hey...
Charlie: So, you know... 
                            I have a little time. If you... if you want to...
Ross: (surprised) Oh... 
                            (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... I'd love 
                            to but I really have to grade these papers.
Charlie: Fine, it's 
                            fine... (she whispers) I'll just shower by myself...
Ross: (Writing on the 
                            papers) B, B, B, B, B!
Charlie: Oh, Ross, 
                            you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.
Ross: Well, it had 
                            some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Ross: Damnit!
Amy: (yelling from 
                            outside) Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! (she 
                            knocks on the door again) I have to talk to you!!
Ross: (he opens the 
                            door) Hi Amy!
Amy: You're not Rachel.
Ross: Still sharp as 
                            a tack!
Amy: Um... Charlie, 
                            this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.
Charlie: Hi!
Amy: Hi!
Charlie: Nice to meet 
                            you.
Amy: H-Hi!!(to Ross) 
                            And you are...?
Ross: (pause) Ross? 
                            I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving 
                            together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
Amy: (looks confused) 
                            N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
Ross: (gives up) Yes, 
                            yes, you did.
Ross: Hi Rachel! Here's 
                            your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants! 
Rachel: Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! 
                            (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?
Amy: Yeah! Hey, sure! 
                            The "Days of Our Lives" guy!
Joey: That's right, 
                            yeah.
Amy: You're not 
                            good!
Joey: Always nice to 
                            meet a fan!
Rachel: So now, what 
                            are you doing here?
Amy: Well, I have huge 
                            news.
Rachel: (Emma starts 
                            crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me 
                            just check on the baby!
Amy: Wait, this is 
                            important! Can Ella wait? (Rachel goes to Emma)
Ross: Ehm... Her name 
                            is Emma.
Amy: Why did you change 
                            it, Ella was so much prettier!
Ross: What do I know? 
                            I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
Amy: Hey, your English 
                            is getting better!!
Ross: (to Joey) Oh 
                            my God!
Joey: I know, she may 
                            be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Ross: What... what 
                            you working on?
Joey: (using a laptop) 
                            Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it 
                            to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or 
                            anything, so...
Ross: Why don't you 
                            use your Thesaurus?
Joey: What did I just 
                            say?
Ross: Watch. (he takes 
                            the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word 
                            you want to change.
                            Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 
                            'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the 
                            word that sounds smartest.
Joey: Oh my God, that's 
                            great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus) 
                            "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! 
                            Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
Amy: So beautiful.
Rachel: Oh, I know, 
                            isn't she?
Amy: No, I was talking 
                            about your bedding.
Rachel: All right. 
                            What's your news, Amy?
Amy: Oh! Um... Well... 
                            I'm getting married.
Rachel: What? Oh my 
                            God! To who?
Amy: This guy! He has 
                            a killer apartment.
Rachel: A-And??
Amy: A-And it's on 
                            Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living 
                            room.
Rachel: No, what's 
                            he like?
Amy: Oh! He's ok. Do 
                            you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
Rachel: Yeah.
Amy: It's his dad.
Rachel: Huh... wow, 
                            so he's gotta be...
Amy: Old? Yeah! But 
                            he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
Rachel: Sweety, I gotta 
                            tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the 
                            apartment more than you like...
Amy: Myron. Hmm... 
                            I told you he was old!
Amy: Humpf, remember 
                            him? How we used to make out all the time after you 
                            went to sleep.
Rachel: Sometimes just 
                            nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but anyway, listen, 
                            not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, 
                            ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate 
                            is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your 
                            age, that is smart, that is fun 
                            and that you care about!
Rachel: Ok.
Mike: I know. This 
                            has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering 
                            so he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR 
                            OF MY LIFE!
Phoebe: ME TOO! I NEVER 
                            THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
Mike: I FEEL THE SAME 
                            WAY!
Mike: Really?
Mike: (looks strangely 
                            shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes 
                            what she did).
Joey: (sounding very 
                            proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too 
                            sophisticated for ya?
Chandler: On every 
                            word?
Joey: Yep!
Monica: Alright, what 
                            was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence 
                            to Joey)
Joey: Yeah, yeah and 
                            hey, I really mean it, dude.
Joey: Why not?
Rachel: Amy, hi!
Amy: I took your advice, 
                            I left Myron.
Rachel: Oh, good for 
                            you! 
Amy: I know! I'm Erin 
                            Brockovich!
Rachel: Yes you are! 
                            Oh, I am so proud of you!
Amy: Thank you! So, 
                            can I stay with you?
Rachel: But Erin Brockovich 
                            had her own house.
Joey: What?
Joey: You slept out 
                            here?
Rachel: No, it's just... 
                            look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was 
                            a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you 
                            guys really took care of me.
Joey: Yeah, Monica 
                            made us!
Amy: Good morning.
Joey: Yeaah.
Rachel: Amy, you know 
                            what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good 
                            time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about 
                            your future.
Phoebe: Hi. I just 
                            had the worst anniversary ever.
Chandler: I doubt that! 
                            Tell her about us last year.
Monica: Oh, well, I 
                            bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he 
                            wrote me a rap song.
Ross: Seriously?
Chandler: Word!
Phoebe: Well, mine 
                            was worse than that.
Rachel: Well, what 
                            happened?
Phoebe: We were at 
                            the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend 
                            on the big screen thing...
Rachel: Oh, that is 
                            so tacky.
Monica: Oh my God, 
                            Mike was gonna propose?
Ross: Well, do you 
                            wanna marry him?
Chandler: She's right! 
                            If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone 
                            stares at him) Did I just say if I were a 
                            guy..?
Monica: Maybe you don't 
                            need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose 
                            to him!
Phoebe: Oh, I don't 
                            know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
Monica: I proposed 
                            to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) 
                            Alright, moving on...
Chandler: Oh, I don't 
                            think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
Monica: Thank you.
Phoebe: (To Rachel 
                            and Ross) Well, do you think I should propose?
Rachel: I think it 
                            could be kind of great!
Ross: Absolutely! You'll 
                            love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Phoebe: Ok, ok, so 
                            how should I do it?
Monica: How about at 
                            a game, on the big screen?
Rachel: (Sarcastically) 
                            Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands 
                            together, faking excitement)
Monica: What? what? 
                            He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed 
                            to, plus he'd never suspect it!
Phoebe: Yeah, that 
                            does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points 
                            to Ross and Chandler) like that?
Chandler: Sounds good 
                            to me... but what would a guy think? 
Amy: (To Rachel) Nana 
                            is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel)
Rachel: (Takes the 
                            phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven 
                            years ago!!
Amy: She did? Who got 
                            her condo in Boca?
Rachel: (Into the phone) 
                            Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes 
                            back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope 
                            you feel better! Ok, bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's 
                            Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
Ross: No, I can't. 
                            I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she 
                            had? Because my throat's been hurting?
Rachel: Menstrual cramps.
Ross: I don't think 
                            that's what this is.
Rachel: (To Monica, 
                            Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?
Monica: No, sorry sweety..
Phoebe: No, I've got 
                            work and then I'm proposing..
Rachel: (To Ross) Great, 
                            shoot, what are we gonna do?
Amy: Well, I can do 
                            it.
Rachel: (Thinks for 
                            a moment) Well, actually... 
Ross: (He interrupts 
                            her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other 
                            side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: Um, I do not 
                            want her baby-sitting our child.
Rachel: Why not?
Ross: Well, for one 
                            thing, she keeps calling her Ella!

Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, 
                            Ella's a nice name!
Ross: Fine, we'll call 
                            the next one Ella.
Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... 
                            the next one?
Ross: (a little confused) 
                            Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
Rachel: Ross, I am 
                            trying to help her become a better person. This is 
                            a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do 
                            something for another human being!!
Ross: I... I don't 
                            know..
Rachel: Ross, I'm telling 
                            you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points 
                            at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this 
                            alright? Do you understand how important that is in 
                            our world?
Amy: um... listen, 
                            I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying 
                            to... Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna 
                            help you guys out, and plus Rachel's been so wonderful 
                            to me... (looks at hem pleadingly)
Rachel: Absolutely.
Amy: (very excited) 
                            Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives 
                            up and leaves)
Chandler: Hey Joe! 
                            How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Joey: Great, I'm finished! 
                            In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
Monica: You dropped 
                            it off?
Joey: Yeah.
Chandler: Can we read 
                            it? Can you print out another copy?
Joey: No can do amigo. 
                            No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal 
                            to hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more 
                            shocked)
Monica: You hand-wrote 
                            it?
Joey: Yeah, and don't 
                            worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! 
                            See ya later! (Leaves)
Monica: Oh my God, 
                            oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're 
                            never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those 
                            old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of 
                            birds!
Chandler: It's ok, 
                            it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll 
                            just call the agency and tell them to throw out the 
                            letter. (starts dialing)
Monica: Okay good.
Chandler: (on the phone) 
                            Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped 
                            off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) 
                            Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs 
                            up looking very confused).
Monica: Ugh, we're 
                            screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on 
                            the way to the bird store.
Chandler: (Still looks 
                            confused) They loved it.
Monica: What?
Chandler: They thought 
                            it was very smart of us to have a child write 
                            the recommendation letter.
Monica: (surprised) 
                            They thought Joey was a child?
Chandler: She guessed 
                            8, 9, based on his drawings.
Amy: Hi!
Monica: Hey, what did 
                            you guys do today?
Amy: Ella wanted to 
                            go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
Chandler: That sounds 
                            like fun.
Amy: Yeah, not really. 
                            Babies are dull.
Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! 
                            Hi, how's my girl?
Amy: I'm fine! And, 
                            I got you a present for letting me stay with you. 
                            Ready?
Rachel: (sounds excited) 
                            Yeah!
Amy: Ta-daaa!
Rachel: (not excited 
                            anymore) You pierced her ears!?
Amy: (Very excited 
                            about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
Amy: Well, if I had 
                            told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now 
                            would it?
Chandler: I think she 
                            looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him 
                            angrily) ... but I am wrong!
Rachel: Oh my God, 
                            Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Amy: Why, did something 
                            happen to his falafel cart?
Rachel: Ugh. (takes 
                            the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with 
                            it)
Ross: Hey guys. 

Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.
Ross: Hey Emma. Oh, 
                            why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely 
                            see. (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries 
                            to stop him).
Rachel: Nah, I don't 
                            really want her to see. 
Ross: Why not?
Monica: Because there 
                            are so many terrible sights in this world.
Chandler: Like war. 
                            Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It 
                            was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Ross: Come here (Removes 
                            Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!
Ross: (sees how strangely 
                            Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?
Rachel: Nothing.
Ross: (Back to Emma) 
                            Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away 
                            from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks 
                            at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference 
                            and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons. 
Rachel: Oh, they're 
                            real!
Ross: Did she (points 
                            at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have 
                            left Emma with her!
Rachel: I know, I know, 
                            and you were right Ross. (To Amy) You are soo 
                            irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever 
                            again!
Amy: Hey you know what, 
                            this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool 
                            fun aunt!
Monica: I'm a cool, 
                            fun aunt!
Amy: (Sarcastically) 
                            O-Okay!
Chandler: Hey! Monica 
                            can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Rachel: I can't believe 
                            this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure 
                            out what to do with your life and this is how you 
                            repay me?
Amy: Well, I don't 
                            need you to help me, because I already know what I'm 
                            going to do with my life.
Rachel: Oh yeah? Since 
                            when?
Amy: Since today... 
                            I am going to be a baby stylist.
Rachel: (looks at Ross 
                            and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?
Ross: That's not a 
                            thing!
Amy: Well, it should 
                            be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, 
                            what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...
Rachel: (shouting) 
                            Babies don't care if they're slim.
Amy: Enter Amy!
Ross: (very angry) 
                            Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
Amy: What? What are 
                            you gonna do?
Ross: (pointing at 
                            Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!
Mike: Great game, huh?
Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... 
                            (seems distracted)
Mike: Why do you keep 
                            looking at the screen?
Phoebe: I'm not. I'm 
                            praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... 
                            Thank you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where 
                            are you going?
Mike: Going go to the 
                            bathroom.
Phoebe: Well, I think 
                            you should wait.
Mike: Why?
Phoebe: Well, if you 
                            don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all 
                            the nutrients.
Announcer: Knicks fans, 
                            please turn your attention to the big screen on the 
                            scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.
Phoebe: Mike Hannigan... 
                            will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)
Announcer: Get a load 
                            of this... She's proposing to him. 
                            Guess we know who wears the pants in that 
                            family. (people are laughing, while Mike still seems 
                            bewildered)
Phoebe: That's not 
                            very enlightened!
Phoebe: Hey, hey! (shouting) 
                            Boo us? Boo you!
Joey: (picks up the 
                            phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, 
                            hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy 
                            and daddy aren't home right now... (looks puzzled) 
                            Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was nice!
Rachel: Joey, get Amy's 
                            bags, she is moving out!
Joey: Whoo-hoo! (and 
                            leaves for Rachel's room)
Amy: You're kicking 
                            me out? 
Rachel: You put holes 
                            in my baby's ears!
Amy: Yeah well, at 
                            least now people will know she is a girl!
Rachel: (gasps) I can't 
                            believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so 
                            beyond help.
Amy: You know what? 
                            Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
Rachel: Excuse me?
Amy: You didn't want 
                            me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. 
                            Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize 
                            her flaws (frantically pointing at her nose) And suddenly 
                            I am the bad guy?
Rachel: (yelling) Joey, 
                            where are those bags?
Joey: (Yelling from 
                            Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap!
Amy: You know what? 
                            When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so 
                            great. Just us sisters, back together again like when 
                            we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! 
                            Who has gotten fat by the way...
Rachel: (doesn't believe 
                            what she's hearing) Seriously?
Amy: hm-mmm... Mom 
                            said she gained like fifteen pounds.
Rachel: Hips or thighs?
Amy: Ass and face.
Rachel: (gasps) Oh! 
                            Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
Amy: She was. Carbs 
                            found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, 
                            talking about real stuff.
Rachel: (embarrassed) 
                            Oh, I can give you that.
Amy: You can?
Rachel: Yeah. I just, 
                            I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... 
                            you're already a pretty perfect version of what you 
                            are.
Amy: (touched) Thank 
                            you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.
Rachel: Did you just 
                            say Emma?
Amy: Ugh, I'm sorry... 
                            Ella.

Phoebe: That woman 
                            at the game didn't know what she was talking about. 
                            Mike, obviously you have balls.
Mike: But please, let's 
                            just forget the whole thing.
Phoebe: (the waiter 
                            puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. 
                            Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however 
                            and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll 
                            say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a 
                            basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like 
                            some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the 
                            cake.
Phoebe: It's in the 
                            cake, isn't it?
Mike: (puts on a fake 
                            smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? 
                            (he takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with 
                            a napkin)
Phoebe: What's the 
                            matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, 
                            I'm sorry!
Mike: No! It's my fault. 
                            I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and 
                            all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want 
                            to spend the rest of my life with you.
Mike: I'm gonna do 
                            this now.
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Mike: Phoebe, I...
Phoebe: Wait! Oh wait! 
                            (she takes off a ring that was already on her left 
                            ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, 
                            but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all 
                            her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these 
                            off.)
Mike: Ready?
Phoebe: Uh-huh! (and 
                            now Mike kneels properly)
Mike: Phoebe, I love 
                            you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask 
                            to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care 
                            of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... 
                            Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Phoebe: Yes!
Mike: I love you!
Phoebe: I love you 
                            more!
Mike: Not possible! 
                            (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna 
                            be Mrs. No Balls.
Rachel: So how is the 
                            uhm... baby styling business going?
Amy: Not that great. 
                            It's almost if people don't want to hear that their 
                            babies are ugly. 
Rachel: That's shocking!
Amy: Oh! It's Ross... 
                            Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel 
                            stand, whose only similarity with Ross would be his 
                            black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to Rachel) He's rude!
