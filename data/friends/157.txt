Ross: Hi.
Rachel: Hi! Hi Ben!
Ben: Hi.
Ross: Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Rachel: Oh, yeah go ahead.
Rachel: No. No.
Ross: (to Ben) Okay! All clear!
Ben: (running to the bathroom) Thanks Phoebe!
Rachel: Ben, it's Rachel! (He closes the door.) But whatever.
Ross: (to Ben) Everything okay in there?
Rachel: Awww, just like his daddy.
Rachel: What-what about Monica?
Rachel: (nervous) So it would just be me alone?
Ross: Well, Ben would be there.
Rachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Yeah I think so.
Ben: Bye dad.
Ben: Not really.
Rachel: Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
Ben: Okay.
Rachel: Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
Rachel: Water it is.
Monica: What about the second minister we met with? I kinda liked him.
Chandler: You mean the spitter?
Monica: All right, what about the third guy?
Chandler: You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Monica: Can you blame him?
Monica: Well then we still have a problem.
Chandler: Yeah!
Phoebe: (returning with Joey) With what?
Phoebe: Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Monica: Are you serious?
Joey: I call it!!
Phoebe: What?! No! It was my idea!
Chandler: Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Joey: Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Chandler: We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say
legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Ben: Sharing is good.
Ben: Really? Like how?
Rachel: Yeah? You like that one?
Ben: Can I do it to you?
Joey: So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Chandler: No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were
still together.
Joey: Well then let me do it!
Monica: That is true.
Monica: It might be kinda cool.
Joey: So I can do it?
Chandler: Yeah you can do it.
Joey: All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my
speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Chandler: Yeah.
Joey: Okay.
Phoebe: Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
Monica: Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)
Phoebe: What is it?
Phoebe: Oh.
Rachel: Coming. 
Ross: I have a bone to pick with you.
Rachel: Uh-oh.
Ross: Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Rachel: Oh that.
Ross: I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught
him right?
Rachel: (looking at his mark) Yes.
Monica: Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.)
Phoebe: Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a
story! (She pulls out the instructions and side effects paper.)
Monica: No Phoebe, those are like the side effects and stuff.
Phoebe: Say what?
Monica: Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there
for legal reasons!
Phoebe: Why?
Monica: In case it happens.
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing
the proof of his ordination.)
Chandler: Hey!
Monica: You did it! You got ordained?!
Joey: Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Phoebe: I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)
Monica: Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her
torso.)
Phoebe: Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: Yeah!
Chandler: (To Monica) Should we call the spitter?
Carol: Hey Rachel! (The camera cuts to her face and we see that Ben pulled the
quarter trick with her as well.)
Rachel: Hi!
Carol: What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Rachel: Okay.
Ben: (jumping up from behind her chair) Gotcha!! (Rachel jumps up startled.)
Carol: (from the kitchen) Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Ben: (mimicking her) Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Rachel: Oh damnit!
Ben: Oh damnit!
Ben: Damnit!
Ben: Damnit!
Rachel: Oh crap!
Ben: Oh crap!
Phoebe: I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?
Monica: Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to
happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Phoebe: Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
(Holds up the warning label.)
Joey: Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Chandler: Yeah. O-okay.
Monica: How about receiving?
Joey: Yes!
Joey: Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so
hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
Joey: I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole
anything?
Phoebe: Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the
eyes?
Phoebe: Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects!
Monica: There you go!
Chandler: Joe?
Joey: Yeah!! I call that London style.
Joey: Oh.
Joey: Yeah baby!
Chandler: And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and
said goodnight.
Joey: Oh.
Joey: Yeah baby!
Chandler: (answering the door) Hey!
Monica: (entering) Is Joey here?
Monica: Really?
Monica: Well, not anymore.
Monica: I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Chandler: How drunk are you?
Monica: Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you
should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Monica: Okay!
Chandler: What?
Chandler: I know.
Chandler: Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna
get under the covers?
Monica: Hm-hmm!
Chandler: Okay!
Monica: Wow! You are really fast!
Chandler: It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Chandler: Yep!
Monica: Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Chandler: Count of three?
Monica: One!
Chandler: Two!
Monica: Two!
Chandler: Eh!
Chandler: Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers
as Joey enters. Remember?)
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: No! No! No!
Chandler: Uh, could you leave me one?
Joey: (pause) For just you?
Chandler: Yeah.
Joey: All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)
Monica: What?!
Chandler: What?
Phoebe: (To Joey) What?!
Chandler: Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Joey: Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!
Chandler: (To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever
in-intend on telling me about this?
Monica: Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It
is you that I am marrying! It is you that I fell in love with!
Monica: Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was
not there that night?!
Chandler: It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you
had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)
Joey: This is crazy.
Phoebe: I know! Robin is so gay!
Rachel: So now what have we agreed?
Ben: No more pranks.
Rachel: And-and what else?
Ben: That you and daddy were not on a break.
Rachel: Very good.
Ross: Rachel! What are you doing here?
Ross: Your good friend?
Rachel: Yeah!
Ross: Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
Rachel: What line?
Carol: (entering from the kitchen) Hey Ross!
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Practical jokes.
Ross: You have a line down your face.
Carol: What? (Goes and checks.)
Carol: (yelling from the bathroom) Oh my God!
Rachel: That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really
just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Ben: (yelling from off camera) Crap!!
Rachel: I gotta go! (Runs out.)
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but
it would probably rather sleep with you!
Joey: Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Chandler: How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this
fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Joey: What?
Joey: Really? I can do it?
Joey: Hey! (They hug.)
Chandler: But those are the words! Those exact words!
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Ross: What?
Ben: What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Rachel: No! Wait! Come on!
Ross: Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
Rachel: EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to
him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)
Joey: Hey!
Monica: Hey-hey.
Joey: So are guys doing okay?
Chandler: Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little
bit and some things in life are more important.
Monica: Yeah baby! (Phoebe and Joey nod.)
Monica: Your favorite!
Joey: Ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge) fried stuff with cheese!
Fat Joey: Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. (They
kiss.) Okay.
Monica: Okay, in we go.
Joey: Here you go.
Joey: Good for you!
