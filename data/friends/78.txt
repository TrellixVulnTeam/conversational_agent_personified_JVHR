Kathy: Can you really do that?
Chandler: I-I think we have too.

the door.) Are you still out there?

reveal a fully furnished apartment.)
Joey: (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Chandler: I sure did.
Joey: Why?
Chandler: Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and
presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing
the TV.)
Joey: Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Chandler: You mean with Casey.

Ross: Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Hey! Samboucha Margarita?

Joey: Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Chandler: Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Monica: (removing ear plugs) What?

rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Phoebe: After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Ross: Yeah, like I could lose it.
