Monica: Hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Monica: Oh my God! You cleaned! (Gasps) Look at these floors! You did the
windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging
works!
Monica: Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
Monica: Well then who?
Chandler: I got a maid. Yay!
Monica: Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
Monica: Did she really say that?
Monica: Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew.
Phoebe: (checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?
Phoebe: Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!
Rachel: Wow! What did he do?
Phoebe: Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your
apartment in two hours.
Eric: Bye.
Rachel: Not so much.
Rachel: Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
Rachel: Yeah that would really be great.
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Shall we?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: What?
Ross: Oh, thank God!
Rachel: Ahh.
Ross: Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes
her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)
Monica: (To Chandler) I love her.
Monica: Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)
Chandler: See? I told you.
Monica: She stole my jeans!
Chandler: (pause) What?
Monica: I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
Chandler: So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front
of you?
Monica: I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans
and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes
back I will find it and show you that stain!
Monica: I guess.
Chandler: Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
Monica: Yeah! (Laughs.)
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
Eric: Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.
Phoebe: Maybe this is too weird.
Eric: I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?
Ross: Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. (He translates
that phrase into Dutch.)
Gunther: Ezel. (Translation: Donkey)
Ross: Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)
Joey: (entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on
tide pools?
Ross: Really?!
Joey: (laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
Ross: Sweet!
Ross: Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
Ross: No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Joey: But Rachel has an apartment.
Joey: She is?
Ross: Damnit!
Monica: Nice jeans!
Brenda: Oh thanks! I like your top.
Brenda: What happened?!
Monica: Oh, I fell asleep.
Brenda: I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
Brenda: All right.
Monica: Hello.
Rachel: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: How was the game?
Rachel: Oh.
Rachel: Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just
let go.
Rachel: I know.
Rachel: I do too a little bit.
Phoebe: Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
Eric: Absolutely. (They kiss and Phoebe heads for the door.) I love the way you
kiss.
Chandler: (entering) Hi!
Monica: Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
Chandler: How come?
Monica: Because I put my head between her legs.
Chandler: To see her pants?
Chandler: Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
Monica: No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Chandler: God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
Chandler: Oh dear God!
Monica: My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: I fear a jury will see it the same way!
Chandler: You see that?
Chandler: You need new clothes.
Ross: Hi. How is she?
Ross: (happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some
bloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)
Ross: All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Eric: Welcome back!
Phoebe: Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?
Phoebe: Why?
Eric: Uh, the sex.
Phoebe: What sex?
Eric: Our sex.
Phoebe: (simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Eric: (simultaneously as Phoebe) Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
Eric: Well I was just so excited to see you.
Phoebe: So I guess this is it.
Phoebe: Yeah, so do you.
Brenda: (noticing him) What are you doing?
Brenda: Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
Chandler: Brenda a bee!
Brenda: What?
Chandler: You do?
Chandler: I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your
bra?
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: You gave them to me!
Rachel: All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a
big ink stain on the crotch.
Monica: Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
Rachel: What bra?
Monica: The pink one with the flowers?!
Brenda: (entering) I quit! (Storms off.)
Monica: Sounds about right.
Rachel: What is this?
Joey: Hello!
Rachel: What about all the women you want to bring home?
Rachel: Joey, are you sure?
Rachel: I want me to stay too.
Joey: Ohh!
Joey: I know! I found it on the street.
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Ew.
Joey: Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)
Ross: (stutters looking for words) Ezels!!
