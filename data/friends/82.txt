Frank: Oh I know!! (Both he and Alice squeal hysterically)
Phoebe: Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse? 
Frank: Uhh, yeah.
Frank: Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby
is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into
another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
Ross: What?
Chandler: Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Rachel: But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Chandler: Well, you-you know what I meant.
Chandler: So what job did you get Joe?
Joey: Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Joey: Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!!
All: Hey!
Phoebe: Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
All: Oh my God!!
Ross: My God!
Monica: Are you serious?
Phoebe: Yeah
Joey: Huh.
Monica: What did you tell them?
Rachel: Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are
things to think about.
Phoebe: I know!
Ross: Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Phoebe: Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim
furniture.
All: Yeah.
Monica: We just want you to think it through.
Phoebe: My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
Kathy: Oh! (They kiss and she leaves)
Monica: I am so jealous.
Chandler: Yes. Right where?
Chandler: Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Monica: And the sex?
Rachel: Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
Monica: Then what is it?
Ross: Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Chandler: Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Chandler: Yeah?
Rachel: Yeah!
Ross: Just go for it Chandler.
Monica: Yeah, you should.
Rachel: Yeah, you should, really.
Monica: Go on.
Joey: Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe Sr: Hi!
Phoebe Sr: No, I was working on my pottery.
Phoebe Sr: Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and
erotica.
Phoebe: Ooh, erotiery!
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Why not?
Phoebe: Oh, I get a puppy!!
Phoebe Sr: Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
Phoebe: Why?
Phoebe: Okay.
Joey: Well, how-how come?
Joey: Whatever.
Monica: I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Chandler: Hi.
Monica: Hey!
Chandler: Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Monica: What?!
Monica: (to Chandler) So, did you do it?
Chandler: Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Monica: Uh-oh, it was bad?
Rachel: Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.
Chandler: (shocked) There are seven?!
Rachel: Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah.
Monica: (continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set
up camp.
Chandler: Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Rachel: Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)
Joey: (standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his table
and they shake hands.)
Ross: All right, there you go!
Joey: Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
Ross: Okay, good-good for you.
Ross: Wow, Rhonda.
Ross: Yeah, okay, Scott!
Rachel: Ooh, it was only okay.
Alice: (entering with Frank) Hi!
Frank: Hi!
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Oh! Ooh! Umm!
Alice: You are so precious, I could just take you home.
Frank: Are you serious?
Phoebe: Uh-huh, yeah!
Frank: Oh, thanks.
Monica: What are you doing?
Phoebe: No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is
a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Phoebe: Oh!
Monica: Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Rachel: It depends on who asked.
Monica: What if I asked?
Rachel: Oh, Mon, sure.
Monica: Really?
Monica: No.
Rachel: Yes! Totally!
Kathy: Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you! (Runs back to
Chandler)
