Phoebe: Ehh?
Chandler: (to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away
in disgust)
Joey: Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)
Ross: (surprised) Hi!
Bonnie: Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
Ross: Awww.
Bonnie: (to Rachel) Thanks a million.
Ross: Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)
Rachel: (softly) Oh my God.
Ross: I know.
Ross: (stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.
Rachel: Whoa! What?! Why?!
Ross: Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Rachel: Here?! Now?!
Rachel: (interrupting) Whoa-ho.
Ross: Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
Rachel: Oh, making it worse!
Ross: Okay.
Phoebe: I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born,
and everyone started lying their asses off!
Phoebe: How close?
Monica: Really?!
Chandler: I found a dried up seashores.
Monica: Sweety, what are you talking about?
Phoebe: (turning around, insistently) Monica!
Monica: Oh.
Rachel: Oh, was it awful?
Rachel: I wrote you a letter.
Ross: Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns
away.)
Ross: Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes
reading the letter)
Ross: Done!
Rachel: You just finished?
Ross: Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very
important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
Rachel: So umm, does it?
Rachel: Does it?
Rachel: Are you sure?
Rachel: I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from
the letter.)
Monica: Ennnh.
Joey: (jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you
guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check
this baby out, dug me a hole!
Chandler: Excellent hole, Joe.
Joey: Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Monica: (screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!
Joey: (climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!
Monica: Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Chandler: Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Monica: Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Monica: What?! What is it?!
Monica: What?!! Gross!!
Joey: If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: How was the beach?
Ross: What happened?
Chandler: Me too!!
Joey: Me too.
Rachel: Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?
Ross: It does. It really and truly does.
Ross: (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!
Joey: No?
Ross: What the hell happened on that beach?!
Phoebe: (to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.
Ursula: Hey!
Ursula: Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
Phoebe: (shocked) You know her?!
Ursula: Yeah. So how have you been doing?
Phoebe: I, umm, shut up!
Phoebe: Noooo!!
Ursula: All right, hang on! (She takes the note, goes back into her apartment
and slams the door shut.)
Monica: Pass the cheese, please.
Joey: Nope.
Chandler: (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Ross: (coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think
about making that beach trip an annual thing?
Monica: What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over
me.
Ross: What happened? Joey?
Joey: All right. (gets up) 
Monica: I was in too much pain.
Joey: And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Chandler: And then Joey remembered something.
Ross: Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About
jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed
on yourself?!
Phoebe: Okay, bye.
Phoebe: No.
Phoebe: I-I like pizza!
Phoebe: Oh my God, so do I!
Phoebe: Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Rachel: Oh-hooo, I missed you.
Ross: I missed you too.
Ross: (getting miffed) I suppose.
Ross: (getting angry) Umm-hmm.
Ross: (yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Chandler: (entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
Monica: You bet.
Ross: And for the record, it took two people to break up this
relationship!!
Rachel: Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!!
Rachel: What?!!
Ross: I fell asleep!
Rachel: You fell asleep?!
Ross: (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)
Monica: Hey!!
Chandler: I KNEW IT!!!!
Monica: (sets down some cards) Gin.
Chandler: We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this
game naked.
Monica: Will you stop!
Chandler: Okay. All right.
