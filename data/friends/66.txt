Ross: (entering) Hey!
All: Hey!
Ross: Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Monica: Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ross: We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Ross: Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Ross: You get the dollhouse.
Monica: I get the dollhouse!
Phoebe: Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
Joey: Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Phoebe: No, just a barrel.
Monica: Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Phoebe: Really?! Really?!
Monica: Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to
play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Chandler: My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Rachel: Hey, Sophie!
Sophie: Hey, Rach!
Chandler: Hey.
Sophie: Hey.
Chandler: Yes, I realise that.
Rachel: Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)
Rachel: (introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler)
Joanna.
Joanna: Me too.
Rachel: Bye, Chandler.
Joanna: Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
Joanna: Oh, Rachel, (pause) actually, y'know what, forget it.
Joanna: Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something
that Sophie would do?
Sophie: Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
Joanna: I know that.
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hello.
Monica: I know!!!
Monica: Okay.
Phoebe: I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She
removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the
house.)
Monica: Not one that can pee on the roof.
Chandler: (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?
Ross: Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient
Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Rachel: (entering) Hey!
All: Hello.
Rachel: I need to talk to you!
Rachel: Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
Ross: I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)
Chandler: Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Rachel: Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about
you...
Rachel: (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you
interested at all?
Phoebe: (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the
house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.)
Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Phoebe: The little ones do.
Joey: Hey, Kate!
Kate: Morning.
Joey: Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last
week...
Joey: (to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was
good, yeah...
Joey: Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
Joey: (looks at her, shocked) What?!
Lauren: I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on
Days of Our Lives.
Joey: Get out of here, really?!
Lauren: Absolutely!
Joey: Yeah? 
Lauren: Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
Joey: They gave me the shaft all right.
Joey: Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a
drink sounds great.
Joey: All right.
Phoebe: Hey! 
All: Hey!
Phoebe: Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
Rachel: Wow!!
Phoebe: Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing
the interior.)
Phoebe: The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come
over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
Ross: This is the coolest house ever!!
Phoebe: Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some
incense)
Rachel: All right!
Ross: I would!
Monica: Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Phoebe: Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the
house.)
Phoebe: And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)
Rachel: (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Rachel: Hmm.
Joanna: Chandler is fantastic!!
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Oh, I....
Rachel: Oh, I know...
Joey: Do you want me to want you to care?
Kate: Do you?
Joey: What?
Joey: What?
Lauren: You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Joey: Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah,
y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
Lauren: Oh, okay.
Joey: Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)
Joey: Okay.
Joey: (to Kate) Ah, are you okay?
Kate: Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
Kate: Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
Joey: How do you mean?
Joey: Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Kate: Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
Joey: Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his
waist.
Kate: And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his
stomach!
Joey: And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and,
and, and bite her!
Kate: And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this
raw, animal....
Joey: Something like that?
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: (to Ross) Hey.
Ross: Hi.
Joey: (to Monica) Hey. 
Ross: Hi.
Joey: Hey.
Joey: No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
Ross: Ohhhhh!
Joey: Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making...
Monica: Oh my.
Rachel: Well, they always called.
Monica: Hmm, bite me.
Joanna: (entering) Did he call?
Rachel: No. Sorry.
Rachel: Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you
are my boss.
Joanna: Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
Rachel: Well...
Rachel: No. I...
Joanna: Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you
work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
Rachel: (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!
Chandler: Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Chandler: (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.
Rachel: I know.
Ross: Mon?
Joey: Hey.
Kate: Hi.
Joey: So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you

Joey: Nooo.
Lauren: (entering) Hi, Kate!
Kate: Hi, Lauren.
Joey: Hi, Lauren.
Lauren: Hi, pig!
Ross: Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
Ross: Yeah.
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What
happened?!
Ross: Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the
point of origin.) In the Aroma Room.
Phoebe: All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Phoebe: Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to
remove it.)
Phoebe: (She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the
Foster puppets! 
Joanna: Well, thanks again for lunch.
Chandler: (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was
pleasant.
Chandler: The food there was, was great.
Chandler: So take care.
Joanna: You too.
