<b><ol start="1">
</ol></b><b><li>EXT. BANGKOK. NIGHT.</li>
</b><i></i><p>A single headlamp in close up shines directly and brightly out</p>
<p>Extreme noise and light.</p>
<p>Beyond its glare can be seen the outline of a motorized tricycle ("tuk-tud") and its Thai driver</p>
<p>A young man, Richard, sits in the back, his rucksack beside him, swaying with the motion of the vehicle. He is worn and sweating.</p>
<p>They travel through nocturnal Bangkok: fleets of tuk-tuks, taxis, road works, food vendors, dogs, tourists.</p>
<p>Music and credits.</p>
<b>
</b>
<b><ol start="2">
</ol></b><b><li>EXT. KHAO SAN ROAD. NIGHT</li>
</b><i></i><p>The bright headlight comes to a halt. </p>
<p>Richard climbs down from the tuk-tuk</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>When you hit Bangkok, there's really only one place to go.</p>
<i></i><p>The street is busy, full of Thai's and travelers.</p>
<p>Richard picks his way through the crowd, his rucksack on his back.</p>
<p>He absorbs the scene as he passes boarding houses and hotels, and the shops and stalls selling food, clothes, pirated tapes, jewelry, travel tickets, and international phone calls. Restaurantes are filled with western travelers watching American films or European sport.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>(continuing)</p>
<p>The Khao San Road is a decompression chamber between east and west. It's where you learn to breathe car fumes and tropical air for the very first time, or else carefully rearrange your memories before you catch your flight home.</p>
<i></i><p>Richard is approached by a young male Thai Hustler who walks backwards in front of him while making his pitch.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>HUSTLER</p>
<p>You need somewhere to stay?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD </p>
<p>I'll be OK, Thanks.</p>
<i></i><p>Richard politely ignores each of his subsequent offers.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>HUSTLER</p>
<p>What do you want? Sell your passport? Buy passport? Airline tickets? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? You get a suit in twenty-four hours. Diamonds? You want to come with me, you get present for your girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem. You want to drink some snake blood?</p>
<i></i><p>At this last one Richard stops and addresses the Hustler.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>No thanks.</p>
<i></i><p>Richard walks on, the hustler fading out behind him.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>HUSTLER</p>
<p>You want designer clothes? I get you Versache, Gucci, Armani, no problem. You want a camera, all the best makes: Nikon, Leica, Canon I can get you.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)	</p>
<p>Yeah, it's all here: you an phone home, meet up with strangers, split up with your friends, watch Hollywood movies while you sip Budweiser and eat a burger or get some massage and green chicken soup. You could be anywhere in the world bu you could only find it here. And what do they want, all these people?</p>

<b><ol start="3">
</ol></b><b><li>EXT. KHAO SAN ROAD. NIGHT./ INT. BARS AND SHOPS. NIGHT.</li>
</b><i></i><p>Various young travelers, male and female, in snapsho9t exerpts, address their comments to the camera or each other.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER 1</p>
<p>Where you been?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER 2</p>
<p>Where you going?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER 3</p>
<p>I've been there</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER 4</p>
<p>It's a waste of time</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER1</p>
<p>We just got back</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER2</p>
<p>Fantastic</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER 3</p>
<p>How much did it cost?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER5</p>
<p>A complete rip off.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER3</p>
<p>Too many people. There's a much better place along the coast.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER 4</p>
<p>We're going exploring. We've read this book. It tells us all the best places to explore.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER 2</p>
<p>I know a place that everyone says is really unspoiled.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER 1</p>
<p>I heard they built a big hotel there.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER 5</p>
<p>Some sort of sewage problem, apparently.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVELER 1</p>
<p>We're going anyway: all the rooms have got air conditioning.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>But for me it's all about finding out something about a place, and something about yourself. And when you get off the beaten track, that's where you find out what there is to find out.</p>
<i></i><p>Richard turns into one of the restaurants.</p>

<b><ol start="4">
</ol></b><b><li>INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT.</li>
</b><i></i><p>The restaurant extends deeply back away from the street. Richard passes many diners not dissimilar to himself. Some are talking, many are engrossed in the video entertainment.</p>
<p>At the back he reaches a reception desk where he drops his pack.</p>
<p>A Thai female HOTEL RECEPTIONIST sits behind the desk. She immediately shows Richard a "menu" of available rooms. The menu offers a spread of prices for single/double/window/fan/aircon/bathroom.</p>
<p>Richard points to the cheapest combination and hands over 300 baht.</p>
<p>The Receptionist becomes aware that he is being started at.</p>
<p>A worn, disheveled man in his mid-thirties is standing at the nearby bar, a bottle in his hand, studying Richard. This is Daffy.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Good evening.</p>
<i></i><p>Daffy says nothing but continues to stare and takes a drink.</p>
<p>Richard will not be stared down. Neither turns away.</p>
<p>The Receptionist passes over a key and smiles broadly.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>HOTEL RECEPTIONIST</p>
<p>Welcome to Thailand.</p>
<i></i><p>Richard turns to her.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<b><ol start="5">
</ol></b><b></b><p></p><li> INT SHOWER. NIGHT</li>
<i></i><p>In a small windowless shower room, Richard stands motionless, eyes closed, facing with pleasure the spray of cold water.</p>

<b><ol start="6">
</ol></b><b><li>INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT</li>
</b><i></i><p>The sound of the shower can be heard through a door marked with a shower sign.</p>
<p>The sound stops and the door is opened. Richard emerges with a towel wrapped around his waist, carrying his key and washbag.</p>
<p>He walks the short distance to his room. He puts the key in the door but the lock is stiff and he has to fiddle with it, bent over and dripping water on the floor.</p>
<p>While he is doing so, the sound of footsteps climbing nearby stairs can be heard.</p>
<p>There is the sound of a loud wolf-whistle.</p>
<p>Richard turns to the source of the whistle.</p>
<p>A beautiful European woman is smiling at him. This is Francoise. She approaches and takes the key from his hand. She turns the key in one direction, then the other, while twisting the handle.</p>
<b></b><p>FRANCOIS</p>
<p>Et voila.</p>
<i></i><p>The door swings gently open. She stands back</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<i></i><p>Footsteps approach from the stair.</p>
<p>Francoise is joined by a young man, ETIENNE, who catches up with her. He nods at Richard as he takes her arm. They walk away from Richard to the next door.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Bonsoir.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Eh - bonsoir.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>ETIENNE</p>
<p>Goodnight.</p>
<i></i><p>The couple reach their door. They enter their room and the door is closed behind them.</p>
<p>Alone in the corridor again, Richard contemplates their presence.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>I was traveling alone for two reasons. First of all, being alone allows you more opportunity to absorb your experiences on a personal level. Secondly, and this I felt acutely at that moment, there was no one who wanted to go with me.</p>

<b><ol start="7">
</ol></b><b><li>INT RESTAURANT. NIGHT</li>
</b><i></i><p>Richard is in the restaurant which is quiet now.</p>
<p>He is alone at a table eating and drinking. On a high shelf several feet away a Hollywood action film, all gunshots, car chases, and explosions, plays on the television.</p>
<p>Most of the tables around him are empty.</p>
<p>Richard is interrupted by the man he met earlier, Daffy, who pulls up a chair beside him.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>I'm Daffy.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Richard. Hi.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Help you out?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I don't think so.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>Just five dollars, please.</p>
<i></i><p>He leans in close to Richard</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>(continuing)</p>
<p>I'll share something with you.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.</p>
<i></i><p>Daffy retreats.</p>
<p>Richard turns back to the video and his food.</p>
<p>Daffy approaches two young women sitting at a nearby table.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>Excuse me, ladies, is there any chance you could help me out. I'm down on my luck at the moment.</p>
<i></i><p>The two young women seem uncomfortable. Richard notices.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>(continuing)</p>
<p>if you could see your way to lending me some cash -</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<i></i><p>He leans across and holds out a ten dollar note for Daffy.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Just take it, OK.</p>
<i></i><p>Daffy takes it.</p>
<p>Richard returns to the video as a big yellow explosion is reflected on his face.</p> 

<b><ol start="8">
</ol></b><b><li>INT. <b>RICHARD</b>'S HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.</li>
</b><i></i><p>Some light enters from the street through a small window.</p>
<p>Richard lies on his bed, watching the fan rotate above him.</p>
<p>He is listening to the sound of Etienne and Francoise engaging in noisy sex. They reach the climax of their activity and fall silent.</p>
<p>Richard just has time to enjoy the silence when a new disturbance begins, this time from the next room in the other <i>direction. It is a man, Daffy, banging on the wall just above Richard's head and shouting in time.</i></p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY (O.S.)</p>
<p>Have. You. Got. Anything. To. Smoke.</p>
<p>Have. You. Got. Anything. To. -</p>

<b><ol start="9">
</ol></b><b><li>INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT.</li>
</b><i></i><p>Richard knocks sharply on the door of Daffy's room.</p>
<p>The door is opened immediately by Daffy, looking even worse then before.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>No, I don't have anything to smoke.</p>
<i></i><p>Daffy stares at him for a moment. Recognition dawns.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>You. You're the guy that lent me the money.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<i></i><p>Richard turns away.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>Richard -</p>
<i></i><p>He turns back.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DAFFY</p>
<p>(Continuing)</p>
<p>Been nice knowing you.</p>
<i></i><p>He sticks his hand out.</p>
<p>Richard politely reciprocates.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<i></i><p>They shake hands.</p> 

<b><ol start="10">
</ol></b><b><li>INT. EXT. RESTAURANT. DAY.</li>
</b><i></i><p>The restaurant fronts on to the street where a new day's activity is beginning.</p>
<p>Richard watches this as he eats his breakfast.</p>
<p>He notices Etienne and Francoise sti down at the next table.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Bonjour.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>ETIENNE</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Did you sleep well?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Not too bad.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>I hope our noise did not keep you awake.</p>
<i></i><p>Richard looks from one to the other.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>ETIENNE</p>
<p>She means your neighbor. The Scotsman</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>ETIENNE</p>
<p>We moved rooms because of him.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>He tried to borrow money from us.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>ETIENNE</p>
<p>What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>ETIENNE</p>
<p>It's on an island that no one get to.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>But he has been there, off course.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>ETIENNE</p>
<p>It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>ETIENNE</p>
<p>Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.</p> 

<b><ol start="11">
</ol></b><b><li>INT. TRAVEL AGENT'S. DAY</li>
</b><i></i><p>On a large board are details, photographs and prices of various standard excursions. A Thai TRAVEL AGENT reels them off at great speed.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>TRAVEL AGENT</p>
<p>Nakhon - Pathom - Phra Ptahom Chedi - Damnoen Sadual floating market - eight hundred baht. Kanchanburi - Erwan national Park Phrathat Cave, huang Khamin Falls - six hundred baht. Nam Tok, hellfire Pass, Three Pagodas, Sai Yok National Park - fifteen hundred baht. Bang Pa In Royal Palace, Ayatthaya, Wat Phra Manhathat, Wat Raburna - one thousand baht. What do you want?</p>
<i></i><p>Richard studies the board but is not excited.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Twenty Marlboro light, please.</p>
<i></i><p>Instantly the Travel Agent produces the packet of cigarettes from a shelf and lays them on the counter.</p>
<b>
</b>
<b><ol start="12">
</ol></b><b><li>EXT. KHAO SAN ROAD. DAY.</li>
</b><i></i><p>Richard lights up and looks around.</p>
<p>He looks through the tapes at a stall.</p> 

<b><ol start="13">
</ol></b><b><li>INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY</li>
</b><i></i><p>Richard walks along the corridor towards his room, his new tape playing on his walkman.</p>
<p>On his door, a folded sheet of paper is attached with a pin.</p>
<p>Richard lifts it off and unfolds it.</p>
<p>It is a detailed and carefully drawn map of a cluster of islands. Some are named. One is unnamed. On it, some features are marked; hills, forest, river and a letter X.</p>
<p>In the corner it reads "X = beach".</p>
<p>Richard switches his Walkman off.</p>
<p>He studies the map then walks to Daffy's door and knocks.</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>Richard twists the handle and pushes gently. The door opens.</p>

<b><ol start="14">
</ol></b><b><li>INT <b>DAFFY</b>'S ROOM. DAY.</li>
</b><i></i><p>The room is dim, be even so the blood can be seen sprayed and smeared around the walls, sheets and floor.</p>
<p>There is no sign of Daffy.</p>
<p>Richard treads carefully, avoiding the pools of blood on the floor.</p>
<p>He reaches the other side of the room. There, wedged in the narrow gap between bed and wall, is Daffy's corpse. His wrists have been cut.</p>
<p>Richard studies the map again.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>You hope and you dream, but you never believe that something's going to happen for you, not like it does in the movies. And when it does, you sort of expect it to feel different. More visceral. More real. Like IMAX maybe. I was waiting for it to hit me, but it didn't. And just for the record, I never did get my ten dollars back.</p>
<i></i><p>Richard switches his walkman back on.</p>

<b><ol start="15">
</ol></b><b><li>INT. POLICE STATION. DAY.</li>
</b><i></i><p>In an office, two policemen, one in UNIFORM and the other a DETECTIVE, stand over Richard while he signs a statement.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>The police didn't want to waste any time on it. They were just pissed off becase he was traveling on a false passport, name of Mr Daffy</p>
<p>Duck, birthplace Ruritania, which kind of fucked up all the paperwork. They pulled everyone in from the hotel, but all they wanted form me was a statement saying I found him and it looked like he cut his wrists. No problem.</p>
<i></i><p>The detective studies Richard's passport.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DETECTIVE</p>
<p>What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Traveler.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DETECTIVE</p>
<p>You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>DETECTIVE</p>
<p>Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.</p>

<b><ol start="16">
</ol></b><b><li>INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR. DAY</li>
</b><i></i><p>The door of the office opens and Richard walks out.</p>
<p>Lined up in the corridor, slouching against the walls, are several other travelers from the hotel. At the front of the queue are Francoise and Etienne.</p>
<p>The officer beckons Etienne into the office and closes the door.</p>
<p>Richard and Francoise acknowledge each other with a smile.</p>

<b><ol start="17">
</ol></b><b><li>INT. <b>RICHARD</b>'S HOTEL ROOM. DAY.</li>
</b><i></i><p>Richard is seated at the top of his bed, addressing his speech out of shot while he holds the map.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>OK, this island may not actually exist. And even if it does, we might not be able to get there. But look at it like this: what else is there to do around here?</p>
<i></i><p>Richard is alone.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>

<i></i><p>Francoise appears behind Etienne.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>

<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Hi there. Here, take a look.</p>
<i></i><p>He shows Etienne the map.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>(continuing)</p>
<p>It's a map. The dead guy left it for me; I think it's the place he tried to sell you. It's going to be just fucking great. You want to come? I'd be thrileld if</p>
<i></i><p>Francoise and Etienne are looking at him.</p>

<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>Thanks to him we hit the final stop on the tourist trail inside twenty-four hours, where, Etienne assured me, we would hire what he called a "local fisherman" to take us on the last stage of our journey.</p>

</dir></b><i></i><p>Sal, a woman in her early thirties, is seated on the floor opposite Richard, Francoise, and Etienne.</p>
<p>Sal is studying Daffy's map. She hands it back to Richard.</p>
<p>Gathered around them are about twenty assorted inhabitants of various nationalities, all weathered travelers in their twenties or thirties.</p>
<p>The longhouse is single story building made from wood and bamboo lattice, about thirty meters long. It is divided up by low partitions into single or double sleeping areas, some of which are personalized, others not. There is also an open area where this action takes place.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>At first they were more interested in the map than us. It seems that Daffy, the guy who drew it, he was a founding father, he discovered this places and set up the community five years ago. Then about one year ago he starts to get depressed, six months later he leaves and that's the last they hear till we turn up.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>He's dead. He cut his wrists open in a hotel room on the Khao San Road. The police didn't know what to do with the body. I guess they'll incinerate him or something.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>Do you tink he gave a mpa like this to anyone else.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I don't know. I don't think so.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>And you, have you told anyone or shown anyone this map?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>ETIENNE</p>
<p>No.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>No.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>No.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>Good.</p>

<p>The longhouse stands at one edge of a clearing, dominating it. Scattered around are several other smaller huts and a few tents. Other locations are the beach, the garden, and the forest.</p>
<p>We see the inhabitants</p>

<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>Now I've got to say that my first impressions were not favorable. Oh God, I thought, it's a tribe of hippies. I thought we'd have to talk about our positive energies a lot, kiss the earth every morning and recycle our waste products by some unspeakable mechanism. Fortunately not. It really was some kind of a paradise. We grew some fruit and some dope. The farmers on the other side left us alone and we didn't trespass on their turf.</p>

<b><li>INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY</li>
</b><i></i><p>Everyone, including Francoise, Etiennne and Richard is sitting around a big wooden table set for dinner. Two people are serving side dishes of vegetables and rice.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>Sal was the leader but it wasn't a big deal. There wasn't any ideology or shit like that, it was just a beach resort for people who don't like beach resorts.</p>
<i></i><p>One man begins drumming softly on the table with his hands. Another joins in, then another. Soon everyone is tapping out a rhythm, against the table or a bottle or a coconut shell, using their hands or a knife or chopsticks.</p>
<p>This is intercut with the following scene to the point where the newcomers have joined in and it reaches a crescendo as the main dish -a massive complete swordfish, is served.</p>

<p>First the three Swedes.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD(V.O.)</p>
<p>There was the Swedes: Christo, Sten, and Karl.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<p>We like fishing</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>KARL</p>
<p>Fishing. Yeah.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>STEN</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<p>And in the winter we like skiing.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>KARL</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>STEN</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<p>But in Thailand - there is no skiing.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>Then there were the Yugoslavian girls.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SONJA</p>
<p>We are from Sarajevo.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>MIRJANA</p>
<p>Our hearts are full of loss</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<i></i><p>They start laughing at him</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SONJA</p>
<p>It's alright.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>MIRJANA</p>
<p>We tell everyone that.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>There was the Weathergirl.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>WEATHERGIRL</p>
<p>I feel a tightness in my pelvis; it's gonna rain.</p>
<i></i><p>Heavy rain falls.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>And yes, unfortunately, there was a man with a guitar.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>GUITARMAN</p>
<p>(singing badly)</p>
<p>"Come as you are, as you were, and as I want you to be"</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD(V.O.)</p>
<p>The only person I didn't like was Sal's boyfriend, Bugs. He was one of those pricks who just won't shut up about all the great things they've seen and done, all of which are just that little bit better, bigger, more dangerous, more extreme, more remote, more unusual, more thi more that more fucking everything than anything you've ever done.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>BUGS</p>
<p>We were in the dessert for three weeks. It's forty-eight in the shade and there's bugger all of that to speak of. We're on one and half liters a day; it's practically suicide. But every morning we'd look east and see the sunrise, and I'd thing, if I die today - it's worth it.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>The local diet was pretty good and most evenings we'd smoke some dope. Most afternoons too, as a matter of fact, but I had a personal rule never to smoke before lunch, although as time went on I allowed myself a certain number of - special occasions".</p>

</b><i></i><p>The drumming reaches its crescendo and the swordfish is laid out.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>This became our world. Pretty soon nothing else mattered anymore: family, friend, future achievements - who cares. Back home was just standing behind a counter all day wearing a stupid fucking hat saying, "how can I help you sir, eat in or take away?" All gone, all faded away. I settled in. I found my vocation.</p>
<b><ol start="60">
</ol></b><b><li>EXT. BEACH. DAY.</li>
</b><i></i><p>Richard, Etienne, and Francoise are standing in waist-deep water. Each is holding a bamboo spear.</p>
<p>Their hair is longer and their tans deeper than when they arrived.</p>
<p>They are watching Christo who stands a short distance away, spear poised for the kill while he talks through the process.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<p>OK. Now you stand still. You wait. The fish come. You wait until the fish are still. They trust you. You wait.</p>
<i></i><p>His speech is hypnotic, calming. His students take in the view.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<p>(continuing)</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<i></i><p>He suddenly throws the spear into the water. He lifts it out triumphant.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<p>(continuing) </p>
<p>You kill</p>
<i></i><p>A dying fish wriggles on the end of the spear.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>

</b><i></i><p>Their feet and legs are visible. At first nothing is happening, then a few fish swim into view.</p>
<p>Richard throws and misses. The other two throw and miss.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<p>No, no, no. Too fast. Slowly.</p>
<i></i><p>They pause</p>
<p>Richard throws. He hauls his spear from the water.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Yo!</p>
<p>A decent sized fish wriggles on the end.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<i></i><p>You are a natural!</p>
<p>They all congratulate him.</p>
<p>Richard raises the spear aloft.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>And I say unto you: I shall provide.</p>
<b><ol start="62">
</ol></b><b><li>EXT. CLEARING. DAY</li>
</b><i></i><p>A bamboo spear, loaded with fish like a giant kebab, is carried across the clearing towards the cooking area wehre the chef and his helpers are at work.</p>
<p>The spear is held by richard who smiles as he deposits the fish on the broad wooden chopping surface.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>That's right, I had an aptitude, a hidden talent. All these years I'm good for nothing, turns out I'm a full-on old fashioned hunter fucking gatherer.</p>
<b><ol start="63">
</ol></b><b><li>INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY</li>
</b><i></i><p>As Richard enters there are only a few people inside.</p>
<p>He walks to the partitioned area and looks for a packet of cigarettes among his possessions.</p>
<p>Opposite to him, Keaty is lying down, reading the Bible.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>KEATY</p>
<p>Ah, the hunter gatherer returns. Satisfied with a good day's killing amongst the fruits of the sea?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>That's me: a good day's killing.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>KEATY</p>
<p>God has smiled on you.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>He has?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>KEATY</p>
<p>He has made you sharp of eye and swift of limb. In other words, you catch a lot of fish, you'll be very popular around here.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>KEATY</p>
<p>Dont forget to thank Him, will you?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I'll try.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>KEATY</p>
<p>He'd appreciate that. Anyway, first day's fishing, first day's catch, you lot are just about ready to join the community.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I thought we already had.</p>

<p>Not yet baptized, my son, not yet baptized.</p>

</ol></b><b><li>EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT</li>

<p>Keaty lifts the knife from the fire.</p>
<p>The entire community is assembled, watching. </p>
<p>He takes Etienne's wrist.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>Every society must have its rituals. They're what binds you together, they tell you that you belong. Ours was simple. Last one to arrive tattoos the next.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>KEATY</p>
<p>It hurts. OK?</p>
<i></i><p>Etienne nods.</p>
<p>Keaty swiftly cuts the simple symbol just below Etienne's shoulder and smears blue powder into the cut.</p>
<p>Etienne winces.</p>
<p>Keaty finishes and hands the knife to Etienne who heats the blade briefly in the fire before he turns to Francoise. He kisses her arm before he cuts.</p>
<p>Francoise takes the knife.</p>
<p>Richard offers his arm. She grips it tightly. She hesitates.</p>
<p>He looks into her eyes.</p>
<p>She cuts. He grimaces. She works on, holding his arm.</p>

<b><ol start="65">
</ol></b><b><li>INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT.</li>
</b><i></i><p>A few candles still burn as people prepare to turn in for the night. Richard is lying in his sleeping area. He is watching Francoise.</p>
<p>She is standing, visible only from the waist up above a partition. She is inspecting her tattoo.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>All the excitement of arrival had given me something to think about, but it wasn't enough to displace my major preoccupation. You can go to the most beautiful place in the world, but the sunlight shall not bleach they passion, nor the tide wash away thy desire.</p>
<i></i><p>A hand. Etienne's appears from below, beckoning her down.</p>
<p>She takes the hand.</p>
<p>Just for a moment her eyes meet Richard's and then she lowers herself towards the ground, disappearing from view.</p>
<p>The last candle is extinguished.</p>
<b><ol start="66">
</ol></b><b><li>EXT. BEACH. DAY.</li>
</b><i></i><p>A game of soccer is in progress, involving most of the population, men and woman.</p>
<p>Etienne is playing well.</p>
<p>A few people, not involved in the game, are scattered along the beach, relaxing. Amongst these are Francoise and Richard, who is watching the game.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>He's good.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Etienne. He's good at soccer.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Oh, I wouldn't know.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>You don't like soccer?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>No. It's so boring.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Yea, but he is good. Look. Nearly scored.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Is that good or bad?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I think it's good. Not that I think there's anything good about being good at soccer. Anyone could do that. I could do it if I wanted to. I just don't want to. That's all.</p>
<i></i><p>She sits up.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Richard.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I don't know. Just conversation.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Do you have a girlfriend?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Here?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Anywhere</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>No. Why?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Just conversation.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I'm not jealous, if that's what you're thinking.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>No, it's what you are thinking. You are far from home. You meet a girl. It's exciting, why not? You are attracted to her - it's in your eyes. Perhaps in hers as well. So you think something might happen; it's easy to believe, it's exciting. But she has a boyfriend so you are jealous. Don't worry. It's natural. Now I have seen enough football. Shall we swim?</p>
<i></i><p>Richard is stunned.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>So would I be wrong?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>What?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>If I thought something might happen - would I be wrong?</p>
<p>She touches him.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Richard, how would I know? I don't know any more than you.</p>
<i></i><p>She walks away.</p>
<p>Richard watches her go. He turns to the football.</p>
<p>Etienne scores.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>And that's all it takes. Nothing more than a few words and the softest touch and your life is different, won't ever be the same again. Man dies, leaves you the mystery map to the secret island: happens every day. But you get a smile from someone you want: well that's special, that's worth the journey.</p>

<p>He is watching Francoise in conversation with Keaty across the other side of the room. During Richards (V.O.) their conversation ends and Keaty walks away, leaving Francoise momentarily alone.</p>
<p>Most of the population is present in the room. Sal is reading.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>I would have liked to have continued our discussion, to thrash out the details of our forthcoming affair, but every time I had the chance to catch her alone, something always got in the way.</p>
<i></i><p>Francoise is alone now. Richard is about to move across when the center of the room is occupied by commotion.</p>
<p>At the heart of this are Bugs, and an Italian man, Gregorio. Bugs is holding a pair of pliers. Gregorio is in pain.</p>
<p>Richard watches.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>BUGS</p>
<p>I can deal with it!</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>GREGORIO</p>
<p>I don't want you to deal with it.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>BUGS</p>
<p>It won't take a minute.</p>

<p>No way/ You can't go to the mainland/ No, etc.</p>

<p>Sal!</p>
<i></i><p>Sal looks up for the first time.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>Sorry, I wasn't really tuned in. You want to go to the mainland? To see a dentist, is that it?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>GREGORIO</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<i></i><p>Sal is casual but firm.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>No. It's out of the question.</p>
<i></i><p>She returns to the book.</p>
<p>With help from two or three other people, Bgs drags Gregorio to the floor and rips out the offending tooth with a pair of pliers. Gregorio screams.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>I was sort of disturbed by this, but really only by the method, by the way that Bugs handled it. But the guy couldn't leave; I could see that. When you have something secret, everyone's got to take responsibility to keep it that way.</p>

</ol></b><b><li>EXT. BEACH. DAY</li>
</b><i></i><p>A tropical lightening storm is in progress.</p>
<p>At the edge of the beach, Christo, Richard, Sten, and Karl are standing under the ineffectual shelter of a palm tree, ecah holding their spear. A short distance away, under anotehr tree, sit Francoise and Etienne, hand in hand.</p>
<p>They are all contemplating the sea and the sky. Christo has a swimming mask and a snorkel.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>In any case, I was more concerned about the Francoise situation. After such a promising start, it just didn't seem to be reaching its natural conclusion. In truth it was beginning to annoy me; I mean what's the use of being in paradise if you can't have whatever you want. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the whole idea?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<p>The problem is seeing the fish. With the rain and the poor light, they are very difficult to catch. It could last for days. Sometimes when it rains, we get hungry.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Hey, Etienne, you going fishing?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>ETIENNE</p>
<p>I don't know, maybe if - </p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Dont' worry. You just sit there. I'll go, OK? I'll go. You just sit there.</p>
<i></i><p>He takes the mask and snorkel from Christo and marches down towards the sea.</p>

<i></i><p>Richard swims along near the sea-bed past rocks and coral but can see no fish.</p>
<p>He surfaces and swims further out.</p>
<p>He hears shouts from the shore. He turns and treads water.</p>
<p>The shouts from his colleagues are indistinct, carried away by the wind and the rain.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>(Shouting)</p>
<p>I can't hear.</p>
<i></i><p>He takes the mask off to clean the lens.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>(Continuing)</p>
<p>And you can't hear me.</p>
<i></i><p>He puts the mask back on and turns away from the shore.</p>
<p>He freezes.</p>
<p>There is a shark's fin in the water, moving towards him.</p>
<p>He looks around. The shore seems far away. He starts swimming frantically towards it.</p>
<p>The shark closes in.</p>
<p>Richard submerges and turns to face the shark.</p>
<p>The shark approaches head on. It is about five feet long with the appropriate teeth.</p>
<p>Richard is terrified, convinced he is about to die.</p>
<p>The shark swoops towards him at speed.</p>
<p>It stops, its teeth centimeters from his mask. It pauses then flicks its tail and swims past Richard.</p>
<p>He is astonished.</p>
<p>It circles him and approaches again, pausing just in front.</p>
<p>Tentatively, Richard raises a hand.</p>
<p>The shark does not react.</p>
<p>Richard pats it gently on its snout.</p>
<p>It swims around him again.</p>
<p>Richard sees small fish swimming around him. He spears one and holds it out on the tip of his spear.</p>
<p>The shark snatches it off and repeats its circle but does not threaten Richard.</p>
<p>He smiles.</p>
<p>As it approaches again, he holds the spear in both hands and lowers it by his side.</p>
<p>The shark bobs in front of him, curious and friendly.</p>
<p>Richard's arms begin their forward motion as his V.O. commences.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>

<p>The shark is bobbin in front of him, practically wagging its tail. </p>
<p>Richard is smiling.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>And at that instant, it was either the shark or me. The shark knew it, I knew it.</p>
<i></i><p>Richard's arms flex. The spear travels up. It stops. Richard grips the spear tightly as it shakes.</p>
<p>Blood spurts out towards Richards' mask in pulses and the sea turns red around him.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>Nothing personal, of course. It's the way of nature. But I swear that in the last flicker of its dying eyes there was a moment between us, when it said -</p>

<p>Bugs waits until these die down.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>BUGS</p>
<p>Strange thing, killing a shark, isn't it?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Just a big fish, Bugs.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>BUGS</p>
<p>Just a big fish? Maybe. Maybe when it's still a baby and it hasn't really learned to kill yet, then maybe it's just a big fish. But when it's a great white angry mother with the taste of human blood on its tongue, well then it's a different story.</p>
<i></i><p>Richard yawns noisily. Some people laugh.</p>
<p>He notice Bugs scowling at him.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Sorry, Bugs. Is it just me or does this wet weather make everybody tired? Maybe we can hear your "very different" and I'm sure "very fascinating" story some other time.</p>
<i></i><p>There is a flurry of exaggerated yawning, sniggering, extinguishing of candles and calls of "goodnight".</p>
<p>Bugs does not laugh. He stares at Richard.</p>
<p>Richard is smiling as he extinguishes the final candle.</p>

<p>You do realize that killing a defenseless shark won't make any difference.</p>

<p>Difference to what?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>KEATY</p>
<p>You and Francoise, that's what.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Sorry Keaty, but I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>KEATY</p>
<p>That is why you killed it, isn't it? Ducked one way then the other! All to impress her, I suppose.</p>
<i></i><p>The second ball is bowled and fielded.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>KEATY</p>
<p>(Continuing)</p>
<p>But you haven't got a chance in hell. I'm not saying you won't get a quick fumble in her knickers down the back of the longhouse but in the long run.</p>

<p>I don't need to discuss this with you.</p>

<p>He's better looking than you.</p>

<p>Richard prepares to face the bowler</p>

<p>Right arm over the wicket. One ball remaining.</p>
<i></i><p>The ball is bowled. Richard hits it in the air.</p>

<p>Within the cave is a large flat rock and moored beside that is a small narrow boat with an outboard motor.</p>
<p>The ceiling of the cave is high and opening into it is a chimney (which will be in use later).  Additional light enters through this.</p>
<p>As Richard surfaces, Sal is already in the boat.</p>

<p>Richard and Sal walk along the strip.</p>
<p>They turn towards a bungalow complex.  Sal is still carrying the parcel of dope.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>- I couldn't be bothered.  It all seemed kind of trashy and out of place.  This was why we kept the secret.  If these assholes ever found out about our island they'd take just one night to spoil it forever.</p>

<b><li>INT. BUNGALOW. NIGHT.</li>
</b><i></i><p>The room is in darkness.  Moonlight penetrates the threadbare curtain.  The bed is surrounded by a mosquito net.</p>
<p>The music from the beach party is audible.</p>
<p>Just visible through the net is the outline of two human forms entwined.</p>

<b><li>INT. BED. NIGHT.</li>
</b><i></i><p>Surrounded by a wall of mosquito net, Richard and Sal lie on the bed.</p>
<p>Sal lies on her side falling asleep. Richard is awake.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Sal.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>No, it's not that.  I just wondered about Bugs.  And me.</p>
<i></i><p>Sal rouses herself.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>OK, it's like this. Bugs is my boyfriend, my partner, and you, you're someone I just screwed.  Is that ok?</p>
<i></i><p>She turns on her side again.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>That's fine.  That's absolutely fine.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>Good, now get some sleep - I may wish to have sex again before we eat breakfast.</p>
<b><li>EXT. BEACH. DAY.</li>
</b><i></i><p>Richard and Sal push the boat into the water and away from the beach, jumping on board as they do so.</p>
<b><li>EXT. SEA/CLIFFS. DAY.</li>
</b><i></i><p>Richard and Sal approach the outer cliffs of the sea-wall in the boat.  Richard looks up.</p>
<p>Bugs is standing at the top of the cliff, directly above the cave.</p>
<b><li>INT CAVE. DAY.</li>
</b><i></i><p>The sacks of rice are now contained in a net being hauled upwards on a rope towards and into the chimney which rises out of the ceiling.</p>
<p>Sal swims away into the tunnel.</p>
<b><li>EXT. CLIFF TOP. DAY.</li>
</b><i></i><p>Bugs and Keaty haul the rice up with the aid of a block and tackle.</p>
<b><li>INT. CAVE. DAY.</li>
</b><i></i><p>Richard is alone as he looks up the chimney and watches the cargo disappear the last few feet to the top of the cliff.</p>
<p>As it reaches the top it is swung aside and Bugs looks down.</p>
<p>Richard and Bugs stare at each other down the length of the chimney.</p>
<p>Richard casually clutches his groin and thrusts once.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>Screwing Sal was pretty good but screwing Bugs - that was even better.</p>
<b><li>INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT.</li>
</b><i></i><p>The longhouse is full of inhabitants.</p>
<p>Richard walks the length of the hut like Santa Claus despensing toiletries and other gifts as requested.</p>
<p>He reaches Francoise alone at the end of the hut.</p>
<p>He gives her the "French" soap.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>For you.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>I missed you.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I'm back.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>What was it like?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>The rice run? No problem.</p>
<b></b><p>FARNCOISE</p>
<p>I mean being with Sal?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Ohfine.  Listen, do you want to go to the beach?</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>I can't.  Meet me tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock at the waterfall.</p>
<i></i><p>She touches him as she walks away.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>I didnt' feel as bad as I should have about all this.  In fact I didn't really feel bad at all.  What happened on Ko Pha Ngan was different, it didn't count.</p>
<b><li>EXT. FOREST/WATERFALL. DAY.</li>
</b>
<i></i><p>Richard is on his way to the waterfall.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<i></i><p>And I was glad to be back.  Now I really did understand why no one wanted to go for the rice.  Life here was so good that <i>going back to the world we came from could only bring you down.</i></p>
<p>He reaches the area by the waterfall and stands waiting.  He looks around for Francoise: no sign. He checks his watch: a few minutes to ten.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL (O.S.)</p>
<p>Hi there, Richard.</p>
<i></i><p>Richard turns to see Sal, who has appeared as though from nowhere.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Oh, Sal.  Hi.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>Hi?  Is that all you can say?  I thought we had a little more rapport than that.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>I mean, hello, nice to see you.  What brings you here.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>I was looking for you.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Oh.  Well, here I am.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>I have to go somewhere.  I'd like you to accompany me.</p>

<b><b></b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Right now?  It's not really all that convenient, Sal.</p>
<b><b></b></b><p>SAL</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Are you meeting someone?</p>

<p>Me? No.</p>

<p>Richard watches her go.</p>

<p>Sal!  How long do I - Sal!</p>

<p>Richard turns back towards the other island.</p>

<ol start="114">
<b> <li>EXT. HILLTOP. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Richard sits at the lookout.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>And the next day, we couldn't meet up either. It was straight back up. Same 
  scene again: no travelers, no boat, no action, nothing. Now I thought if this 
  is going to be a regulra situation, I'm going to have to start hiding from Sal 
  so I don't have to come up here. But a strange thing happened: I began to 
  enjoy it. I looked forward to it, I started to explore.</p></ol>
<ol start="115">
<b> <li>EXT. HILL. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>From a vantage point, Richard looks down on the lagoon, the beach, the 
  forest, and the clearing.</p>
<p>With the binoculars he can see the details of life in each of these 
  areas.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. ISLAND SCENES. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Through the binoculars, various characters are at work or at rest including 
  Francoise, Etienne, Sal, Bugs, Keaty, etc.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>And then I couldn't understand why I'd never come up before. I got a whole 
  new perspective. They were ants, or rats in an experiment, but up here I 
  wasn't part of it, I was free. I could do whatever I wanted. This was my 
  personal adventure playground. There was even a bunch of local bad guys I 
  could fool around with.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. FOREST NEAR DOPE FIELD. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Looking through the trees, the four dope farmers (with their guns) are 
  visible about thirty meters away, relaxing and playing cards.</p>
<p>Richard appears in a tree, hiding from their view, if they cared to 
  look.</p>
<p>He steals forward to another tree. He watches them.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>Pretty soon, I was starring in my very own war movie. It was Vietnam 1968, 
  or at least about as close to it as I would ever get, considering I was born 
  in 1973. But I knew exactly who I was: renegade special forces officer on a 
  solo mission, search and destroy. I liked the sound of it "he prefers to work 
  alone," they'd say, "he's got the stare."</p><i>
</i><p>The farmers are oblivious.</p>
<p>Richard advances as far as he dare: a few meters from them.</p>
<p>He peers at them around the edge of the tree.</p>
<p>He notices that the one nearest has left a knife on the ground.</p>
<p>Richard lifts a stone and throws it high in the air beyond the farmers.</p>
<p>As it falls through the trees to the forest floor the farmers are startled. 
  They stand and turn away towards the noise reaching for their guns, cocking 
  them, etc.</p>
<p>The knife is taken by Richard.</p>
<p>The farmers see a bird fly from a tree. Satisfied, they give up and return 
  to their resting place.</p>
<p>Richard steals away from tree to tree.</p>
<p>The farmer cannot understand where his knife has gone.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. FOREST. DAY <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Richard sits in a hollow under a rough shelter he as made from palm 
  leaves.</p>
<p>He is using the knife to gut a bird of some sort which he then eats 
  raw.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>I hadn't entirely forgotten my purpose up here, but I wasn't worried about 
  it. I mean I didn't want one of those bastards turning up with my map sticking 
  out of his pocket, but if they did, it was going to be a challenge. It was a 
  mission, my mission, to defend our island.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. HILLTOP. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Richard watches the empty beach.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>The only hitch was - the enemy didn't show up. Now it was probably a 
  mistake, but I one day I brought Francoise up. I thought I'd show her 
  around.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. FOREST. DAY <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Richard struggles through dense undergrowth, followed by 
  Francoise.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Come on, just through here. Watch out for the thorns. Here: look.</p><i>
</i><p>Beneath a tree, a few rotting logs are topped off with palm 
  leaves.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>(continuing)</p>
<p>Well, what do you think?</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>What is it?</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>It's a shelter. I built it. I thought we could move up here. Get away from 
  it all.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>We?</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Yeah. You'll need to tell Etienne, of course but - </p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Richard, it's horrible.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Primitive, yes, but you have to accept some limitation when you go for 
  seclusion like this.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>And to eat?</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Whatever I kill, we'll eat.</p><i>
</i><p>Francoise laughs.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Enjoy yourself, Richard. I'll see you later, back in civilizatin.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Do you want a mushroom?</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>What?</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>They grow here, all over the place. I picked some. Here.</p><i>
</i><p>Richard collects a handful from under the shelter.</p>
<p>Francoise does not think this is funny.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>No thanks.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Please yourself.</p><i>
</i><p>He swallows one.</p>
<p>Francoise turns away. She struggles back through the undergrowth.</p>
<p>Richard watches her. He swallows a handful of mushrooms.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. FOREST. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Close up: a caterpillar crawls along a green leaf.</p>
<p>Richard, his pupils dilated, is watching, transfixed.</p>
<p>He holds the knife at the end of the leaf.</p>
<p>The caterpillar crawls on to the blade.</p>
<p>Richard sticks his tongue out and swivels the blade around.</p>
<p>The caterpillar crawls on to his tongue.</p>
<p>Richard gently closes his mouth.</p>
<p>He swallows.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>When you're a highly trained combat machine, you can't allow yourself to be 
  distracted by minor problems in your personal life. And you can't sit around, 
  you have to stay active, otherwise your energy will dissipate. You have to 
  feed the fear.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT/DAWN. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Richard, his face disrupted by mud, sneaks towards the rough shelter of 
  wooden planks and palm leaves under which the four farmers are 
  sleeping.</p>
<b> <li>INT. EXT. SHELTER. NIGHT/DAWN. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>The shelter is several meters long but shallow and is open down the length 
  of one side.</p>
<p>This is the farmers' home on the island.</p>
<p>It contains a collection of tools, arms, crates, bedding, food, cigarettes, 
  and bottles of cheap whiskey.</p>
<p>Spaced out within the shelter, the four farmers are asleep on low pallets 
  or mats on the ground, each with their gun by their side.</p>
<p>Richard enters the shelter and surveys the scene.</p>
<p>He approaches the nearest farmer who lies asleep. He is wearing a bandana 
  which has slipped half off in his sleep.</p>
<p>Very slowly, Richard reaches down and lifts the farmer's gun, a 
  Kalashnikov-type assult rifle.</p>
<p>Richard holds the weapon, becoming comfortable with it.</p>
<p>He lifts the butt to his shoulder and squints down the sight.</p>
<p>He closes in on the farmer, so close that the muzzle is almost tickling the 
  farmer's nose.</p>
<p>In his sleep, the farmer swats at his nose as he might swat at a fly. 
  Richard withdraws the gun a fraction.</p>
<p>His finger strokes the trigger.</p>
<p>He moves very carefully around the shelter, pointing the gun at each 
  sleeping farmer and mouthing "bang" as he goes.</p>
<p>He returns to the first farmer and kneels beside him.</p>
<p>The farmer is on his side, facing away from Richard. He stirs in his sleep 
  and wakes slightly.</p>
<p>He reaches out behind him to feel for his gun. His hand feels the metal. He 
  relaxes and closes his eyes again.</p>
<p>Behind him, Richard smiles and releases his own grip on the gun.</p>
<p>Instead he lifts the bandana away from the farmer's head and puts it on his 
  own.</p>
<p>Now he produces the knife from the back of his shorts.</p>
<p>He kneels beside the farmer and holds the knife firmly.</p>
<p>Abruptly he stabs it into the upright wooden plank behind the farmer's 
  head.</p>
<p>The blade sinks deep into the wood.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. WATERFALL. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Richard screams as he executes an exhibition dive from the top of the 
  waterfall to the pool below.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. BEACH. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>There is no one on the beach apart from Richard.</p>
<p>He walks to the water and dives in.</p>
<p>He surfaces and faces the sun.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>I was ecstatic. In a fair contest I had infiltrated their command and left 
  my mark. I had fulfilled my potential as a warrior, a soldier, a killer on the 
  loose. I could just imagine them trying to work how the missing knife got 
  home.</p><i>
</i><p>Christo, Sten, and Karl appear walking down the beach with their fishing 
  gear as Richard walks in from the water.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Hi, guys.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<p>Hello Richard.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>I couldn't wait to tell Francoise about it.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. FOREST. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Richard's face is slapped twice by Francoise's hand.</p>
<p>They are standing in a small clearing not far from the longhouse.</p>
<p>Francoise raises her hand to slap him again. He retreats a 
  fraction.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Do you want to calm down? I'm trying to tell you about something exciting. 
  I'm trying to share it with you and all you can do is freak out because you 
  don't like where I want to live.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>I don't care about that.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>No? Still pissed about the mushrooms. You know Francoise, sometimes you are 
  so uptight.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>You liked to me. About Sal.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Oh, that. She told you?</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>She told everyone. She believes in openness and honesty, not like 
  you.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Come on, you were two-timing Etienne.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Because I liked you. I didn't know you were going to screw Sal twenty-four 
  hours later.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Well if you're going to make such a big deal out of it -</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Bugs is going to kill you. And you know what - I don't care.</p><i>
</i><p>She raises her hand and slaps him again.</p>
<p>Richard does not flinch.</p>
<b> <li>INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Richard enters the longhouse.</p>
<p>Inside are several people, including Bugs, sitting at the far end.</p>
<p>When they see that it is Richard, all conversation stops.</p>
<p>One by one at first, then en masse, everyone except Bugs leaves the 
  longhouse, hurrying past Richard at the door.</p>
<p>Richard and Bugs stare at each other down the length of the longhouse.</p>
<p>Richard smiles. He repeats the gesture that he made when returning with the 
  rice: he clutches his groin and thrusts towards Bugs.</p>
<p>Bugs starts running towards Richard.</p>
<p>Just as Bugs reaches him he takes evasive action, feinting to one side.</p>
<p>Bugs, cursing, pursues Richard around the longhouse, each of them trampling 
  over possessions and partitions. Bugs is bigger but Richard is too sly and 
  nimble for him, taunting and mocking as he dodges around the narrow upright 
  supports that run down the middle of the building.</p>
<p>Eventually Bugs has Richard cornered.</p>
<p>They face each other, crouched slightly, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>From outside a loud, horrified screaming begins.</p>
<p>It carries on and on.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Don't you think we ought to go see what the problem is?</p><i>
</i><p>Bugs pauses for a moment. He glances towards the door for a fraction of a 
  second.</p>
<p>Richard slugs him in the jaw.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. CLEARING. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Richard emerges from the longhouse, flexing the fingers of his punching 
  hand.</p>
<p>A crowd has gathered as he joins it.</p>
<p>At the center are Karl, on his knees, wailing and shouting in Swedish, and 
  Sten, who has been savaged by a shark and looks dead. Despite his appearance, 
  Keaty and Gregorio are attempting to resuscitate him.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>Poor Karl: he didn't speak much English, but he only needed one 
word.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>KARL</p>
<p>Shark! Shark!</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>They were trying to save Sten's life although even as a novice in this 
  field I could tell that just wasn't going to happen.</p><i>
</i><p>Richard backs away.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. BEACH. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Richard walks along the shore and begins to follow a bloodstained furrow in 
  the sand.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>The way I saw it, sharks live in the sea, so if you go swimming where they 
  live, they might eat you. That's what sharks are good at, that's what they do. 
  I could have explained this to Christo but I just knew he wouldn't see 
  it.</p><i>
</i><p>Richard is standing over Christo who is lying in agony on the 
  sand.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<p>Richard! My foot. My foot! It's so painful. My foot!</p><i>
</i><p>Richard looks at Christo's right leg: it has been bitten off beneath the 
  knee, leaving only a ragged bloody stump.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Yeah, your foot - it's - pretty bad.</p><i>
</i><p>Christo clings to him.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<p>But it will be ok? Please Richard, when I get to the hospital?</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Hospital?</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>CHRISTO</p>
<p>Tell me - it will be ok.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Yeah. Sure. Christo, it'll be ok.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. GRAVE STIE. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>A freshly dug grave in sandy soil about 1.5 meters deep.</p>
<p>The corpse (Sten) in a sleeping bag is slung into the grave, its feet 
  protruding from the end.</p>
<p>Immediately, the earth starts to be filled in from either side.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>KEATY (O.S.)</p>
<p>We are gathered here today to pay our last respects to Sten. I couldn't 
  claim to know the bloke all that well but what I knew, I liked. He was a 
  straightforward, easy to get along with, reliable sort of guy. He worked hard 
  for the whole community - he even lost his life fishing for us.</p><i>
</i><p>Keaty is addressing the entire community beside the grave while earth is 
  heaped on.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>KEATY</p>
<p>He made an effort to join in whatever was going on. For example, he played 
  cricket with an aptitude and enthusiasm that belied his Nordic origins, and I 
  think we can see that as a symbolic ofhis place amongst us in a wider sense. 
  Anyway, he wasn't one for long speeches, and neither am I. May God take you 
  soul, and you shall rest forever in peace mate. We'll miss you.</p><i>
</i><p>Keaty holds back a tear as he throws a flower in the grave.</p>
<p>Others throw flowers in.</p>
<p>Bugs hammers a wooden cross into the ground behind the grave.</p>
<b> <li>INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Christo is being nursed by Etienne who is mopping his brow, trying to get 
  him to drink etc.</p>
<p>Several people are sitting around, inactive and silent.</p>
<p>Christo moans. A couple of people get up and leave.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>After the funeral we all tried to get back to normal, but it just didn't 
  seem right. After a while it became clear that the problem was Christo. You 
  see, in a shark attack, or any other major tragedy I guess, the important 
  thing is to get eaten and die, in which case there's a funeral and someone 
  makes a speech and everyone cries and says what a good guy you were, or: get 
  better in which case everyone can forget about it. It's the hanging around in 
  between that really pisses people off.</p>

<p>It's not that they don't care, Etienne, it's just that they don't care in 
  the same way as you do. It's a fine distinction, I know.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>ETIENNE</p>
<p>I understand: they wish he was dead.</p><b>

  swimming.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>It would be a lot easier to condemn our behavior if it hadn't been so 
  effective, but out of sight really was out of mind. The bad smell was gone - 
  it was like we had amputated Christo from our community and after the 
  operation was over, we felt a whole lot better.</p><i>
<b> </b></i><p>UNDERWATER. DAY.</p>
<p>In water one meter deep, moving forward with a smooth side-to-side action, 
  the POV of some underwater creature.</p>
<p>Small fish scatter ahead of it.</p>
<p>Suddenly a pair of legs come into view: they are Francoise'.</p>
<p>Close right in on them at speed.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. SEA. DAY.

<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>Richard!</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>That's not funny.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Hey, relax, just a joke. What's wrong with you?</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>No, what's wrong with you? Why didn't you stop them moving Christo?</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>Francoise I just thought we ought to spend some time together. We haven't 
  had a chance to talk, and let's face it, it's going to be a lot easier for us 
  to do that if Etienne isn't hanging around the longhouse.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>I don't believe it. You really think it was alright to move him.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD</p>
<p>He was getting everyone down.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>FRANCOISE</p>
<p>I don't know what has happened to you, Richard.</p><b>

<p>I like it here! That's what happened! So what's the problem?</p><i>
</i><p>Francoise turns and walks away.</p>

</i><p>She does not reply.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>

<p>If I was going to warn them, then now was the time to do it. All I had to 
  do was walk out and tell them not to make any noise I could lead them to 
  safety. I could persuade them to go. I could threaten them. If the worst came 
  to the worst, I could lead them to the camp and we could kick the shit out of 
  them, then send them home. But I didn't want to do any of those things. I 
  wanted to see what would happen.</p><i>

</i><p>Zeph stops singing. He has seen the farmers, armed and watching him from a 
  few meters away.</p>

  direction of Richard's hiding place. </p>
<p>One of the guards shoots at her repeatedly, missing.</p>
<p>The others start shooting at the remaining three, cutting them down in a 
  hail of bullets.</p>
<p>The German girl keeps on running, zigzagging as she goes.</p>
<p>The farmers fire but miss.</p>
<p>She reaches the place where Richard is hiding, couched down in the 
  undergrowth.</p>
<p>Startled by seeing him, she stops abruptly.</p>
<p>Richard and the German girl stare into each other's eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>Suddenly her chest explodes forwards as a single bullet rips through from 
  her back.</p>
<p>She falls to the ground.</p>
<p>Richard is spattered in her blood.</p>

<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>I was trying to remember somewhere I used to call home, someone I used to 
  be, but I couldn't put a name to that place or a face to that person anymore -

  cut his wrists.</p>

<p>Richard appears alone in the clearing, the knife in his hadn.</p>
<p>Thunder and lightening begin.</p><b>
<b> </b></b><p>RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
<p>I still didn't know what I was going to do when I got to them. You see, 
  when you have blood on your hands, you ask yourself, what difference will it 
  make if you spill some more? I had made a sacrifice to keep the secret, and 
  now that sacrifice was the secret.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Richard approaches the faint glow of the small tent where Francoise is 
  nursing christo.</p>
<p>He is carrying the knife.</p>
<p>He crawls close up to the tent. Etienne is sleeping in the open 
  doorway.</p>
<b> <li>INT. LONGHOUSE NIGHT. <i>

<p>The thunder is directly overhead and the lightening flashes frequently.</p>
<p>Sonja stirs in her sleep.</p>
<p>In a flash of lightening she thinks she sees something.</p>
<p>A whole series of flashes provide a clearer view.</p>
<p>At the end of her bed four corpses, Zeph, Sammy, and the two German girls, 
  hang upside down and bound together from the central beam in the roof of the 
  building.</p>
<p>Zeph appears to be staring at her, his hair trailing against her feet.</p>
<p>She screams.</p>
<p>More lightening illuminates the four armed Farmers.</p>
<b> <li>EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. <i>
</i></li></b> <p>Richard crawls towards the sleeping Etienne.</p>
<p>Inside the tent, Francoise has her back to the entrance as she mops the 
  brow of Christo, feverish and unconscious.</p>
<b> <li>INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. <i>

<p>He opens his eyes, frozen with fear.</p>
<p>Richard is aware of a gaze from another direction. Keeping the knife at 
  Etienne's throat, he turns to see that Francoise is looking at him. They stare 
  at each other.</p>
<p>Richard takes the knife away.</p><b>

<p>Bugs turns his attention to Francoise. She pulls the start cord and the 
  engine starts.</p>
<p>Bugs holds one end of the mooring rope, pulling the boat towards him while 
  Francoise tries to undo the other end.</p><b>

  rushes him.</p>
<p>Richard manages to avoid the blade.</p>
<p>They fight.</p>
<p>Bugs forces Richard on to the ground</p>
<p>He is about to stab Richard.</p>
<p>Etienne appears behind Bugs, struggling on his feet, bleeding from his 
  wound.</p>
<p>He is holding a piece of rope. He slings it around Bug's neck.</p>

<p>He falls back into the water, pulling Bugs with him.</p>

  great it's going to be, and I try to tell them: you can go too far, you can
