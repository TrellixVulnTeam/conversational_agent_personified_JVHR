BILLY: . I love violence! Billy offers Julian a hit from his bottle of Mehkong whiskey. Julian refuses. He's more interested in the fight. BACK TO THE RING where the fight has just started. Liang is immediately on the ropes. Julian watches, concerned. Billy takes a phone call but he can't hear. He nods to Julian and takes it outside. BACK TO THE FIGHT where Liang pulls an amazing move. Turns the tables. Takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs, swings and backfists. As Julian applauds Liang's success, Billy slinks off out of the Liang wins the fight with a knock out. The crowd go wild with Julian watches, transfixed. Liang is lit up by a beatific white light. As he stands triumphant in the middle of the ring, the crowd start to gather round him. Julian continues to stare at what's taking place before him. . Which is almost like a religious ceremony. The audience bow down before Liang as he stares out into the light. A look of calm washing over his face. A sense of stillness and peace. Enlightenment through victory and violence.
JULIAN: Two fifty, three hundred. Liang takes the money. Julian pulls off two more notes. A bonus.
JULIAN: ( ON THE PHONE ) Hold on, hold on. What did he say? Beat as Julian listens. He glances over at Gordon who looks up, ( ON THE PHONE ) No, tell him to stay there. Tell them both to stay there. ( ON THE PHONE ) I'm coming over.
JULIAN: He still in there?
THE LIZARD: . No. Beat. Julian glances at Gordon.
JULIAN: You told him I was coming.
THE LIZARD: Wouldn't listen. Julian stares at him.
JULIAN: Well maybe you didn't try hard enough. The Lizard takes the handkerchief away from his nose. Shows the bloodstain to Julian.
THE LIZARD: Just cause I ain't slept for three days, don't mean I don't know right from wrong. and your brother has become a real problem. Again Julian stares at him - clenching his fist. The Lizard notices this but gazes up into Julian's face blankly.
JULIAN: THE LIZARD
THE LIZARD: Good - 'cause Billy ripped me off and then he broke my face. Julian turns to Gordon.
GORDON: Like I always said. One day he's going to meet the devil. You know where he is now? The Lizard stares at Julian.
JULIAN: You know where he is now? The Lizard stares at Julian.
THE LIZARD: Bangkok has millions of people my friend. You and your brother, you're lost to my world. The Lizard gets up - puts out his cigarette and looks at Julian.
JULIAN: You go. I'm gonna look around. See if I can find him.
GORDON: Go on. He turns back to The Lizard.
JULIAN: Go on. He turns back to The Lizard.
THE LIZARD: His brother didn't pay.
GORDON: So? That's his problem.
THE LIZARD: Now it's your problem.
GORDON: I'm with you mate. Billy's fucked
THE LIZARD: You don't pay his debt - you don't enter. Gordon thinks for beat. Takes out his money.
GORDON: How much.? .and The Lizard smiles for the first time.
JULIAN: You seen Billy?
MA LONG: Not this evening. A particularly pretty prostitute catches Juilan's eye. He stares at her, stone faced.
JULIAN: Well if he comes in, tell him I'm looking for him, yeah?
MA LONG: He's not coming in. I tell him to stay away. He hurt one of my girls Julian. Not good. Julian considers. Pulls out his wad of notes again. Hands a few to Ma Long.
JULIAN: Yeah, well. if you see him, tell him I'm looking for him. Ma Long nods as she takes the money. Julian is about to leave. He looks at the pretty prostitute again. Stares at her for a moment. Then walks out.

JULIAN: Julian's not here mate. Fuck off. Beat - then we hear a voice from behind the door.
JULIAN: What is it?
JULIAN: I can't deal with my brother right GORDON ( O.S. ) He's dead. Julian opens his eyes, confused - still out of his head on drugs.
JULIAN: No answer. Finally Julian gets up and wraps a towel around his body and slowly opens the door. Gordon stands in the hallway - behind him two Thai men from Julian's
GORDON: They found his body in a hotel room. Julian doesn't know what to say. Neither does Gordon.
MAI: What happened? Julian looks at her.
JULIAN: Someone killed Billy. The camera ZOOMS IN on Mai.
GORDON: What do we do?
JULIAN: For now. We wait. Julian glances back at the body.
JULIAN: Hello Mum. It's me. Julian. Something's INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - DAY The CAMERA tracks as we follow a pair of high heeled shoes belonging to an elegant woman in her fifties, who looks like she's in her forties and could actually pass for late thirties. She strides towards reception, a Porter struggling to keep up with her. This is Jenna Hopkins. Head of a notorious London Crime Family. Mother of both Julian and Billy. Newly appointed Lady Macbeth of Bangkok. She hands her passport over to the Concierge.
JENNA: I'd like to check in now please. The Concierge checks the computer.
CONCIERGE: I'm afraid the room won't be ready until four o'clock. Beat. Jenna just stares at him.
JENNA: I'd like to speak to your manager. Yes of course. The Concierge retreats. Jenna lights a cigarette.
CONCIERGE: Yes of course. The Concierge retreats. Jenna lights a cigarette.
MANAGER: Good afternoon madam, what seems to be the problem?
JENNA: Listen to me. I've just travelled six thousand miles to see the corpse of my first born son and I haven't slept for thirty hours and he says I can't go to my room. The Manager just stares at her but is clearly taken back by her I'm sorry madam.
MANAGER: I'm sorry madam.
JENNA: How much?
MANAGER: . it simply isn't possible. Jenna pulls out a massive bundle of notes. Peels off a couple of hundred dollar bills.
JENNA: .Fuck off you cunt, just hand me the fucking key. She lays the money on the desk. The manager looks around.
MANAGER: Well I might be able to arrange The Manager turns to the Concierge.
JENNA: Don't leave the money there. Some cunt'll nick it. Put it in your pocket. The Manager hesitates.
MANAGER: There's really no need
JENNA: Put it in your fucking pocket. The Manager takes the money. Pockets it. Places the key on the Room 300.
MANAGER: Room 300.
JENNA: Hey. Open this. Jenna points to the Duty Free bag then starts running a bath, beginning to undress.
PORTER: Madam. I have to return to my station. Jenna snaps out of it in an instant.
JENNA: What, yeah, thanks. She pulls a fifty dollar bill out of her purse. She hands the money to the Porter who leaves as quickly as he dares.
JULIAN: ( ON THE PHONE ) JENNA ( V.O. ) It's me.
JULIAN: ( ON THE PHONE ) Hi Mum. Where are you?
JULIAN: ( ON THE PHONE ) Julian looks at his watch.
JULIAN: ( ON THE PHONE ) Okay. so, what d'you want to do?
JENNA: Could it be have been one of the gangs?
JULIAN: Maybe. Take your pick. Billy wasn't What do you mean?
JENNA: What do you mean?
JULIAN: You know Billy. He was eccentric. Jenna smiles to herself as if this brings back memories and Julian even smiles. Both sit in silence for a moment.
JENNA: But you're going to find out who did it, right?
JULIAN: I'll make sure it gets done.
JENNA: No, it needs to be you that does it. We need to show them. Do you understand what I'm saying?
JULIAN: Yeah, okay, I'll do it.
JENNA: HOLD ON Julian as we bring up the SOUND of Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire.
VOICE: Love is a burning thing And it makes a firey ring Bound by wild desire I fell into a ring of fire
CHANG: I fell into a burning ring of fire I went down, down, down And the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire And the cops are all there, Daeng included, watching him.
CHANG: I fell into a burning ring of fire I went down, down, down And the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire The Cops watch with total devotion.
JULIAN: Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee. At the mention of his name the colour drains from Choi Yan Lee's face. His eyes lock with Julian's.
CHARLIE LING: ( IN THAI )
JULIAN: Ask him why he killed my brother.
CHARLIE LING: ( IN THAI )
CHARLIE LING: He says he killed his daughter. Julian considers him for a moment. Slowly he pulls out a gun. Aims it at Choi Yan Lee's face.
JULIAN: What's he saying? He says. He says he's paid for what he's done. That he's been punished Choi Yan Lee nods his head enthusiastically.
CHARLIE LING: He says. He says he's paid for what he's done. That he's been punished Choi Yan Lee nods his head enthusiastically.
JULIAN: Who did that to him? Choi Yan Lee looks at the various faces that surround him - then stares directly at Julian.
CHARLIE LING: ( IN THAI )
JULIAN: What's he saying?
CHARLIE LING: He's lying.
JULIAN: Tell me.
CHARLIE LING: It's a story old women tell their grand children. 'The Angel of Vengeance' is supposed to come down from the heavens and judge the living. restore karma to the world.. Gordon laughs. but Julian listens with great interest.
JULIAN: How does he do that?
CHARLIE LING: Leads people to their destiny. That's the myth anyway. Ko Sam smiles. Julian doesn't. Finally:
JULIAN: Ask him who cut his hand off. Charlie Ling's reluctant to question him further. Julian insists.
CHARLIE LING: ( IN THAI )
CHARLIE LING: He says it was The Angel of Vengeance. Choi Yan Lee starts to giggle uncontrollably.
JULIAN: What's he saying?
CHARLIE LING: ( IN THAI )
JULIAN: What did he say? Charlie Ling considers Choi Yan Lee. Realizes he's not going to get a better answer out of him.
CHARLIE LING: He said you don't find The Angel of Vengeance. He finds you. Julian considers this for a long time. He realises he's not pointing his gun anymore. Puts it away.
GORDON: Are we going to kill him or what? The room suddenly feels stuffy. The atmosphere oppressive. Julian's got to get out.
JULIAN: Nothing. We're not going to do anything. Just leave him. Leave them EXT. KIOSK - DAY Julian stumbles out of the kiosk and breaths in lungfulls of air. Disoriented, he careers into a stall selling various religious artefacts, sending candles, incense and statues of Buddha He falls to the ground. When he gets to his feet everything around him seems intense and incredibly vibrant. The dogs fighting on the street, the Buddha that lies in pieces on the ground, the children that stand watching him, his crew as they come out of the kiosk, hiding their guns. Julian takes a long moment to get his bearings. Finally he stands up, but as he does he feels different. As if the axis of his world has shifted.
JENNA: Did you kill him? Beat. A shared look between Gordon and Julian.
JULIAN: It's a little bit more complicated than that Mum.
JENNA: Complicated? He killed my son. What's so fucking complicated about Mum, calm down.
JULIAN: Mum, calm down.
JENNA: Don't tell me to calm down. I want him Beat. Julian does not know how to explain the situation. Jenna stares at him.
JULIAN: I know, you always say that - but this is different.
JENNA: Silence. Julian doesn't know how to answer. Jenna watches him
JULIAN: Maybe. Maybe Billy had it coming.
JENNA: What are you talking about?
JULIAN: .because of what he did. Jenna thinks it over for a moment.
JENNA: I don't care.
JULIAN: Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered your brother and we're not going to let him get away with it.
JENNA: Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered your brother and we're not going to let him get away with it.
JULIAN: What if. What if it was The Angel of Jenna stares at her son like he's finally lost the plot.
JENNA: The Angel of fucking what.?
JULIAN: .it - or he - restores karma and order in the world.
JENNA: 'Restores' things? Who said anything about 'restoring' things? He loves all humans.
JULIAN: He loves all humans.
JENNA: I don't know what kind of spiritual journey you're on, but you will kill
HIM: I'm not, I'm just. Julian can't get the words out. He gets up.
JULIAN: I'm not, I'm just. Julian can't get the words out. He gets up.
JENNA: How's business?
GORDON: It's alright, yeah. Well, what with Billy not being around, it's tricky to be honest.
JENNA: What d'you mean?
GORDON: Well, we're supposed to be moving five keys out the end of this week. But Billy's not here, is he?
JENNA: I'm here. Julian's here. Gordon shrugs. Jenna clocks it.
GORDON: I don't know. Earlier today - we had the guy. The guy that killed Billy. Had a gun against his face. But then - nothing.
JENNA: Julian let him go. Now there's all this stuff about angels. I don't know what the fuck's wrong with him.
GORDON: Julian let him go. Now there's all this stuff about angels. I don't know what the fuck's wrong with him.
JENNA: Not like you. Gordon smiles at her uncertainly.
GORDON: I know how to do what needs to be done. That's all. She stares at him, long enough to make him uncomfortable.
JENNA: So tell me. What did he mean when he said it was complicated?
GORDON: There's this other guy. Might have been involved.
JENNA: So we kill them both.
GORDON: We don't know who the other guy is yet.
JENNA: Okay. Well how about we start with the guy we do know?
MAI: Sorry I'm late.
JULIAN: It's alright. He drinks his drink. Silence.
MAI: What's wrong?
JULIAN: Mai looks around the bar. It's half empty - some girls and men spread out. The waitress comes over and Mai orders a drink. They sit in silence, listening to the song.
MAI: See anyone you want us to take home Julian glances round but shakes his head. Looks at Mai.
JULIAN: What's with you? You want to get high? Beat. Silence. Finally.
MAI: What's with you? You want to get high? Beat. Silence. Finally.
JULIAN: I want you to meet my Mum. A pause, Mai slightly taken about.
MAI: Is she here? Julian nods.
JULIAN: To show her. To show that I've got something here.
MAI: What, like we're a couple? Julian stares at her for a long time. Can't quite say it out loud, but the answer's yes.
GORDON: Never come back - you understand me? Liang nods.
JULIAN: When did you last see him?
LIANG'S SISTER: Last night. He went out.
JULIAN: Did he have any enemies?
LIANG'S SISTER: LIANG'S MOTHER ( IN THAI )
LIANG'S MOTHER: ( IN THAI )
LIANG'S SISTER: Someone called his mobile.
JULIAN: LIANG'S SISTER
LIANG'S SISTER: She doesn't know. They spoke in Liang's Mother pulls out a mobile phone. Passes it to Julian.
JULIAN: This his phone? Liang's Sister nods. Julian scrolls through the numbers. All have Thai names against them - except one. Julian considers the number, then redials. A beat. Then the SOUND of a phone ringing in the same room. Gordon looks round. Realises he's busted. Takes his phone out. Kills it. Julian stares at him. Before he gets a chance to say anything, there is a knock on the door.
JUILAN: What do they want?
JULIAN: No, I'll talk to them.
JULIAN: Good morning officers. How can I help Slowly Chang turns to face him. Julian stares at him as if he's in a trance.
KIM: We're investigating the murder of Choi Yan Lee. Julian recovers. Turns to Kim and shrugs.
JULIAN: Never heard of him.
KIM: His arm was cut off. Here. Julian manages to cover his reaction.
JULIAN: I run a boxing club. Not much call for one armed men. A beat. Mexican stand off.
KIM: He was the father of the girl that was found dead with your brother.
JULIAN: Then I guess you boys have got a lot of work to do - so have I, so if you'll excuse me.
KIM: That's why we're here Mr Hopkins. If you could just answer our questions.
JULIAN: Sure, sorry. What do you want to know? Julian looks over to Chang who continues staring at the boxers. The way the ring is lit he's almost silhouetted.
KIM: Where were you last night?
JULIAN: With my mum. Some of the boxers come over to Chang. They know him. They're reverential. With the effect of the lighting, it seems to Julian like they're bowing down before a God.
KIM: That wont be necessary at the moment.
JULIAN: Am I suspect? Chang turns round to face Julian. His presence is magnetic. Julian stares back at him, realizing that this must be the Angel of Vengeance. Chang walks over to them. Studies Julian for a long moment and then turns to Kim.
CHANG: ( IN THAI )
JULIAN: I want you to find out who that guy is. Sure. No problem.
GORDON: Sure. No problem.
JULIAN: The SOUND of Nadee singing 'LONELY COMING DOWN' by Dolly Parton.
CHANG: Why are you here?
JULIAN: You're him. Aren't you?
CHANG: The one who killed my brother. Chang says nothing for a long time.
JULIAN: The one who killed my brother. Chang says nothing for a long time.
CHANG: I love all living things. I restore karma. Is that why you came?
JULIAN: I came here to kill you.
CHANG: What's stopping you?
JULIAN: I don't know.
CHANG: Would you like me to tell you? Julian nods.
JULIAN: Cause, all my life. I don't know.
CHANG: Cause, all my life. I don't know.
JULIAN: Cause, all my life. I don't know.
CHANG: Yes you do.
JULIAN: My mother wants me to kill you. Chang stares back at him.
CHANG: And what do you want?
JULIAN: . I love violence.
CHANG: You want to fight me? Julian nods.
JULIAN: Thai style.
KIM: ( IN THAI )
PHAIBUN: ( IN THAI ) ( IN THAI )
DAENG: ( IN THAI )
PHAIBUN: He used to be a great boxer.
KIM: He has to do it. Since he came out of the coma, that's what he's done. Whatever's been asked of him, he's done it. He can't help it. It's all a A mutual pause.
DAENG: And if he loses?
PHAIBUN: He can't lose. He's the Angel of EXT. CHANG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Nadee is standing behind Chang. They're playing a game in which they speak in English. She points out the window.
CHANG: `She points at the table.
NADEE: `She points at the table.
CHANG: Do you like the table?
NADEE: Do you like the table?
CHANG: Yes. I like the table. Chang stiffens. Nadee detects the change in him.
NADEE: What is it? Chang takes her in his arms. He starts kissing her neck.
CHANG: I need to speak to you in Thai. A pause.
NADEE: ( IN THAI )
CHANG: ( IN THAI )
MAI: What is it?
JULIAN: You can't wear that.
MAI: Why not?
JULIAN: My mother's. Very particular about You're kidding?
MAI: You're kidding?
JULIAN: She hates red. Come on, we'll get you something else. Mai stares at him, reluctant to give in.
MAI: This is insane.
JULIAN: Look, I'm telling you. It's easier this way. Trust me. Mai gives in. Takes his hand.
JENNA: So. May, isn't it?
JULIAN: It's Mai, Mum.
JENNA: How long have you two known each other Mai's about to answer but Juilan gets there first.
JULIAN: A year and a half isn't it? Beat as Mai quickly counts in her head.
MAI: .that sounds about right.
JENNA: Well it's always a rare treat to meet one of Julian's lady friends.
JULIAN: Mum, please.
JENNA: So, where did you two meet?
JULIAN: I saw her walking down the street. Jenna raises an eyebrow.
JENNA: I hear that happens a lot in this part of the world. Tell me, what's your line of work, Mai?
MAI: I work in the service industry.
JENNA: I bet you do. But tell me Mai, before you started serving my son, how many cocks were you serving? Was it over a Mai stares at Jenna in disbelief.
JULIAN: Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake.
JENNA: I'm sorry Julian, but I won't stand by and let a dirty little hooker take advantage of my son in the vain hope that her womb isn't so diseased that she can trick him into impregnating her and putting another cocksucking child on to this earth.
JULIAN: Leave her alone Mum. You've got her wrong. She's a good girl.
JENNA: What do you know about what's good? Beat. Julian says nothing.
MAI: He's good to me.
JENNA: Well that's nice isn't it, I'm really happy for you
JULIAN: A pause.
JENNA: Oh really, shame that, still, live by the sword, die by the sword.
JULIAN: I know it was you, Mum.
JENNA: I did what had to be done.
JULIAN: He was there. He was with them.
JENNA: The Angel of Vengeance.
JULIAN: The Angel of Vengeance.
JENNA: D'you kill him?
JULIAN: Cause he as good as killed Billy. What I want to know is, what are you going to do about it?
JENNA: Cause he as good as killed Billy. What I want to know is, what are you going to do about it?
JULIAN: I'm not going to kill him.
JENNA: Yes you are. You're going to do it for me and you're going to do it for your This isn't about Billy. This is about me. All my life I've been running.
JULIAN: This isn't about Billy. This is about me. All my life I've been running.
JENNA: That's right you cunt, cause you always run away whenever there's a problem. just like you're running away from killing this fucking Angel of whatever
JULIAN: - his name is Chang-
JENNA: Mai stands up.
MAI: I should be going now.
JENNA: Sit down you cunt.
JULIAN: Mum, don't talk to her like that. Mai sits down.
JENNA: So what am I left with? Julian stares at her.
JULIAN: Jenna calms down. She looks at their reflections in the mirror behind the bar. We ZOOM in on the mirror, their faces refracted by the glass.
JENNA: You're right. We're family. We stick together. But Billy was family too.
JULIAN: Billy was a fuck up. He deserved everything he got. You know it and I know it.
JENNA: That's it. I'm not listening to this. I don't ever want to hear you mention his name again. Do you hear me?
JULIAN: Yeah we were brothers, but we were never close. And he was only in Bangkok cause you couldn't control him. So you sent him to me
JENNA: You could have protected him.
JULIAN: I did what I could. And that's more than you ever did.
JENNA: I would've done anything for him. Okay, he wasn't born with as many advantages as you were. He struggled with things. But I always stood by him.
JULIAN: And what did that get him? I'll tell you what, a one way ticket to this fucking place, just like me.
JENNA: Don't you dare blame me for what happened back then.
JULIAN: I'm only here 'cause of you. If you didn't exist, I wouldn't be here. I could've been someone, Mum. I was on my way. Jenna stares at him - this is a conversation she does not like You would've been a great fighter. You could've gone pro.
JENNA: You would've been a great fighter. You could've gone pro.
JULIAN: Don't you think I know that? And look at me now. I'm a front for a drugs He turns to Mai.
JENNA: At least you're not behind bars and that's more important to me. Julian turns to her - he has been waiting all his life to say That's right Mum. That's what's more important to you. But what about me? Sometimes I think you only got me out of there so the cops couldn't trace it back to you. Jenna stares at him. Her face a mask.
JULIAN: That's right Mum. That's what's more important to you. But what about me? Sometimes I think you only got me out of there so the cops couldn't trace it back to you. Jenna stares at him. Her face a mask.
JENNA: Surprise me.
JULIAN: 'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the ring. Me versus him.
JENNA: Well that seems sensible. And what do you hope that's going to achieve?
JULIAN: I don't expect you to understand. Cause you don't understand anything that isn't about you.
JENNA: And when you lose, what's going to happen then?
JULIAN: I don't know. But maybe this time I'll win. Like you say, only God forgives. Maybe this time he'll forgive me. Jenna turns to Mai.
JENNA: Do you understand what he's talking about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking a clue.
JULIAN: You never did, Mum. A pause. Julian's touched a nerve. Jenna recovers.
JENNA: I hope you find what you're looking for. 'Cause if you don't, it's going to find you and I'm not always going to be there to look after you. Jenna composes herself. Suddenly brightens. A different person.
MAI: Are you alright? He's not. He's crying. But he doesn't want anyone to see.
JULIAN: I'm fine. I'll be fine. In a minute. Julian wipes his face clean. Pulls himself together.
GORDON: Nice evening?
JENNA: Lovely, yeah. Just catching up, you Jenna sits down. Lights a cigarette.
GORDON: Well, I don't know about that. Just been out here a while. Know how to get things done.
JENNA: I bet you do.
GORDON: But things are going to shit. Since Billy died, Julian's all over the We'll have to something about that the, wont we? But, first things first, what about Chang?
JENNA: We'll have to something about that the, wont we? But, first things first, what about Chang?
GORDON: My son's guardian angel.
JENNA: My son's guardian angel.
GORDON: He's just a retired cop.
JENNA: Good, then he won't be to hard to kill, will he?
GORDON: It's not that simple. Is there somewhere we can go that's a little more Beat. She raises her eyebrows.
JENNA: What did you have in mind? Gordon blushes. Moves closer, conspiratorial.
GORDON: You can't just going round killing cops here anymore. It's not that easy.
JENNA: I didn't say it was easy. But then, you're a resourceful man, aren't you?
GORDON: I looked into it. Chang's a hard man to get to. None of the Thais'll go near Well then you're going to have to find someone who's not a fucking Thai then, aren't you?
JENNA: Well then you're going to have to find someone who's not a fucking Thai then, aren't you?
GORDON: There might be a way. But Julian can't find out. Jenna looks at Gordon - smiles and crosses her legs.
JENNA: Don't you worry about that. There are certain things that a mother and son shouldn't - and don't - discuss. Gordon thinks he does but isn't a hundred per cent sure.
MAI: What are you doing?
JULIAN: Seeing when it hurts. Mai watches him. He doesn't flinch.
MAI: I'm going to go. Julian takes his hand off the flame. Sees she's left the clothes he bought her behind.
JULIAN: Didn't you like what I got you?
MAI: It's fine, but you know. It's not my What do you mean?
JULIAN: What do you mean?
MAI: Maybe you should give it to your mother.
JULIAN: Don't to be so hard on her. Her life hasn't been easy.
MAI: Come on Julian. She's a fucking bitch.
JULIAN: Don't say that, okay? You don't know what you're talking about. She'd do anything for me.
MAI: The way she talks to you
JULIAN: Don't go there.
MAI: What? 'Don't talk about my mother'? Come on Julian. Julian stands up, angry.
JULIAN: You don't get to judge her. You think she's bad? You should've met my dad. But he's not around anymore, and do you know why? Cause she loved me too much. He lets go of her neck. Mai rubs her neck.
MAI: You're fucked. He pulls money out of his pocket.
JULIAN: How much do I owe you? He forces a roll of notes into her hand, forcing her to take it.
MAI: Fuck you. She opens the door, sets fire to the money, and walks out of the As she walks down the hotel corridor, Julian slams his fists into the wall.
YURI KARKOV: . so why do you want to kill a policeman? Policemen are good. They mind their own business and keep the streets safe. Stop people stealing my You really want to know?
JENNA: You really want to know?
YURI KARKOV: Yes. It may effect the price.
JENNA: He killed my son.
YURI KARKOV: Revenge. Pricey.
JENNA: This is Bangkok. Nothing's that You're right. Most things are cheap in Bangkok. Especially life. We'll take care of this business for you. But it won't be easy and it won't be cheap.
YURI KARKOV: You're right. Most things are cheap in Bangkok. Especially life. We'll take care of this business for you. But it won't be easy and it won't be cheap.

YURI: You better have a fucking good reason for doing this. Don't you know who you're fucking with. Chang looks at him.
CHANG: ( IN THAI )
YURI: Can someone tell me what the fuck this guy's trying to say. Chang calls over to the barman.
CHANG: ( IN THAI )
DIMITRI: It was an English woman - she wanted you dead. A beat. Not what Chang expected.
CHANG: Said you. murdered her son..
DIMITRI: Said you. murdered her son..
CHANG: Who was she?
DIMITRI: I don't know.
CHANG: How did she know me? Dimitri shakes his head. He really doesn't know.
DIMITRI: She asked for you by name.
CHANG: And what's my name?
DIMITRI: Chang starts to circle him. Dimitri's terrified. Doesn't know what the fuck he's on about. Suddenly he's grabbed from behind by Phaiban. Chang smashes a beer bottle and walks up behind Dimitri.

REFEREE: ( IN THAI )
JULIAN: Come on. Chang retreats. Shrugs at Julian. You come on. Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take out his frustrations, the bell goes. End of round one. Julian stalks back to his corner. He turns to look at Chang, a look of intense anger and frustration.
REFEREE: ( IN THAI )
KIM: ( IN THAI )
CHANG: It wasn't you, was it? Julian shrugs, puts his guard up.
JULIAN: What are you talking about?
CHANG: It's not your fault. Chang raises his arms again. Ready to fight. Julian gets ready to attack but something's changed. The fire's gone out of him. He looks over to his mother, to Mai, Chang's words echoing in his mind. It's not his fault. Then Chang comes in with a flurry of punches. Left, right, left, right. Julian just takes them. Chang pauses in the onslaught. Julian stays motionless in the middle of the ring. Chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out a roundhouse left kick - - which makes contact with Julian's draw. SLOW MOTION as Julian's head takes the impact. He's out cold before he hits the floor.
JENNA: He doesn't want to see anyone. Mai is disappointed. Doesn't know what to say.
MAI: .tell him I came?
JENNA: Of course. Jenna hugs Mai close.
JENNA: You deserved to win. You should've
WON: Give it a break mum. Just. give it as rest. He steps into the light. She reaches out to touch him.
JULIAN: Give it a break mum. Just. give it as rest. He steps into the light. She reaches out to touch him.
JENNA: I'll never get use to seeing you get hurt - even when you win.
JULIAN: Yeah, well I lost.
JENNA: And did it make a difference? Julian says nothing.
JULIAN: . No. it didn't make a difference. No difference at all.
JENNA: And how do you feel now?
JULIAN: Nothing. I don't feel anything at all.
JENNA: Don't you see, that's how I felt when Billy died. Julian studies his mother.
JULIAN: What do you want, Mum? What d'you think I want? I want it to be like it used to be. I don't want to lose you. Jenna starts crying. Could be real, could be an act - hard to tell she's so good.
JENNA: What d'you think I want? I want it to be like it used to be. I don't want to lose you. Jenna starts crying. Could be real, could be an act - hard to tell she's so good.
JULIAN: What's wrong Mum? She shakes her head. Can't say it.
JENNA: He knows. He knows it was me.
JULIAN: Who does? Beat. Jenna says nothing. Julian thinks. Cogs turn.
JENNA: He's going to come after me. And after he's come after me, he's going to come after you. Julian stares at his mother; fragile, terrified, alone.
JULIAN: We'll be okay - I'll do it, I'll take him out.
JENNA: Not just him. We've got to take them all out. Julian stares at her - the power she has over him.

JULIAN: I need you here. Right now.
JULIAN: Julian kills his phone. He's still for a moment, then:
KIM: They wont disturb us. Chang nods. The elevator door opens.
CHANG: What floor?
KIM: CUT TO:
JULIAN: What's it say? Charlie starts reading the article out:
CHARLIE LING: "Boxing Cop Hero Back From Grave". One of Bangkok's finest, blah blah blah, came out of a coma that lasted for an entire year, waking up as if nothing had happened. Wife was really happy, blah blah blah. "It's hard to describe" Chang said, "but I do feel Charlie starts to sneer as he reads. Julian is listening intently.
JULIAN: The Angel Of Vengeance.

JENNA: I came here to collect my son's body. Now it's released, my business in Bangkok is completed.
KIM: When are you leaving?
JENNA: And your other son - is he going with I've had no real contact with Julian since he ran away.
KIM: And your other son - is he going with I've had no real contact with Julian since he ran away.
JENNA: I've had no real contact with Julian since he ran away.
KIM: You watched him fight. Jenna looks over to Chang.
JENNA: I watched him lose. And he deserved to. You were the better fighter. My only sadness is that Billy got caught up in what he's doing out here. And paid for it with his life. Kim and the rest of the crew take this in.

CHARLIE LING: Julian turns back. Charlie Ling nods towards Kanita's room.
JULIAN: No way.
CHARLIE LING: SHE SAID JULIAN ( CONT'D )
SHE SAID: Who said? My mother? Charlie Ling nods.
JULIAN: Who said? My mother? Charlie Ling nods.
CHARLIE LING: If you've got a problem, talk to her.
JULIAN: No. We're not doing it.
CHARLIE LING: You don't have to. I will. Charlie Ling kicks open the door. Julian realises he can't let him do it. And as Charlie Ling sees Kanita. Julian shoots him in the back. Charlie Ling slumps to the floor. Julian approaches the doorway. He looks in. Sees Kanita sitting on her bed. She stares at Julian, Charlie Ling's dead body at his feet. They hold each other's gaze. and then Julian slowly bows his head and leaves.
JULIAN: Only God forgives. And now mother - you will die. He rings the bell, raising the shotgun, ready to shoot. The door
GORDON: Julian says nothing. Edges into the room. The gun still pointed at Gordon's head. Julian says nothing. Kicks the door closed with his foot.
JULIAN: Where's is she?
GORDON: She's gone. Picked up Billy's body. She's gone home. Finally Julian lowers the shotgun.
JULIAN: I'm so fucked.
GORDON: We're good mates aren't we? Beat. Julian's instantly suspicious.
JULIAN: . Yeah.
GORDON: I'm sorry about this Julian. I wish there was another way. Gordon levels a pistol at Julian's head.
JULIAN: What did she say? What did she promise Don't make this harder GUNSHOT. A bullet RIPS through Julian's shoulder. He falls back on the car behind him setting off a chorus of car alarms. Gordon starts to walk round to deliver the killer blow.

MAI: What happened to you? Beat. Julian almost smiles.
JULIAN: I've got to get out of Bangkok. Didn't want to leave. He winces.
MAI: Who did this to you? A pause.
JULIAN: My mother. She made me what I am. And now I've got nothing. And they're after Mai stares at him.
MAI: Come with me. Julian looks at her.
JULIAN: I got about twelve grand at the club. Should be enough to get us there. Set ourselves up. Disappear.
MAI: Right now. Mai looks around - they're alone.
JULIAN: Right now. Mai looks around - they're alone.
MAI: Wait outside.
MAI: Let's go.
JULIAN: Stay here. If I'm not out in five minutes. Go. Mai nods.
MAI: Five minutes. Julian nods and slams the door shut. Mai watches Juilan disappear into the building.
CHANG: Let's go. We TRACK IN to a CLOSE SHOT on Julian. It's almost as if this moment was inevitable.
CHANG: ( IN THAI )
JULIAN: I'm sorry.
CHANG: ( IN THAI )
JULIAN: Don't hurt her. He kicks him in the stomach.
CHANG: ( IN THAI )
JULIAN: I'm sorry. Chang kicks him again - like you would kick a dog. Juilan groans. Chang squats down next to him.
CHANG: ( IN THAI )
JULIAN: I don't know. I'm sorry. Chang gets up and walks on. He stops and turns round.
CHANG: ( IN THAI )
CHANG: ( IN THAI )
JULIAN: Dark. Darkness. Chang looks at him in a strange way - like this answer has some meaning for him.
CHANG: ( IN THAI )
JULIAN: No. Never. Chang considers this answer for a long moment. He gets up and returns to Mai - stares at her..
CHANG: ( IN THAI )
CHANG: Country roads, take me home to the place I belong West Virginia, mountain momma Take me home, country roads.. The Cops sit and watch him. Their leader. Their God.
YESTERDAY: CUT TO:
CHANG: Country roads, take me home to the place I belong West Virginia, mountain momma Take me home, country roads Take me home, country roads Take me home, country roads And we end CLOSE on Chang. With the sense that the 'country roads' have kind of taken both of them home.
