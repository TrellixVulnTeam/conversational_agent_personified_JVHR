T: EXT. FIELD - DAY 1 1 children's laughter. Excited shrieking. through the fields, being chased by her younger brother, GEORGE, and sister, ANNE, ( 10 ). skimming along the sheaves. parents, ( SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH BOLEYN ).
SIR THOMAS: I received a formal request for marriage today for Anne. From the Carey family.
LADY ELIZABETH: But that's wonderful.
SIR THOMAS: I turned it down. LADY ELIZABETH turns.`What?'
SIR THOMAS: And offered them Mary instead. SIR THOMAS indicates Pretty. Sweet-natured.
SIR THOMAS: Fnne's too good for William Carey. She can do ( better than a merchant's son.
LADY ELIZABETH: You underestimate Mary.
SIR THOMAS: Not true. I think she's..the kinder of the two. Quite possibly the fairer. The CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race..
SIR THOMAS: But to get ahead in this world, you need more than fair looks and a kind heart. On the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished.
SIR THOMAS: ( applauding his favourite ) Bravo! Anne!
ANNE: May we come in..? ANNE and GEORGE enter. GEORGE lets out a low whistle..
ANNE: Look at you..! Younger than me. More beautiful than me. Married before me. I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other Boleyn Girl.'
MARY: No, is this it? This is the end of the unholy trinity? GEORGE extends her arms, wraps them around his two sister. An intimate moment.
GEORGE: No, is this it? This is the end of the unholy trinity? GEORGE extends her arms, wraps them around his two sister. An intimate moment.
MARY: No, George. Never. I'll be married, that's all.. Apart from that - it won't change a The three of them hug together, tightly..
PRIEST: Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in The PRIEST sprinkles the ring with holy water. WILLIAM CAREY, ( 35 ), puts it on MARY's finger. few rows back, a young NOBLEMAN stares at ANNE. Looks at her across the church. Obviously attracted. ANNE notices.
WILLIAM: Are you happy?
MARY: You don't secretly wish you'd married someone grander? With a title?
WILLIAM: You don't secretly wish you'd married someone grander? With a title?
MARY: No. I want a husband who loves me. And who thinks it first thing every morning. And last thing at night.
WILLIAM: Then you've found the right man.
ANNE: Who is that? He was staring at me in That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of Northumberland. Richest landowner in ANNE's eyes widen in interest, "Really?"
GEORGE: That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of Northumberland. Richest landowner in ANNE's eyes widen in interest, "Really?"
GEORGE: But don't get your hopes up. He is already betrothed. GEORGE indicates a tall, haughty-looking FIANCEE beside PERCY..
ANNE: Betrothed is not married, brother George. A lot can happen before you reach the altar. ANNE stares over at HENRY PERCY. Who stares back.
SIR THOMAS: he DUKE ignores THOMAS, and goes instead to his sister, ( LADY ELIZABETH ), and kisses her..
NORFOLK: I think I have managed to persuade the King to come and stay with you on progress. A week-end's hunting in late But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank you so much.. Did you hear that, Elizabeth?
SIR THOMAS: But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank you so much.. Did you hear that, Elizabeth?
LADY ELIZABETH: ( hates the idea ) Finally we can present George, and with luck, get him a position at court.
SIR THOMAS: Finally we can present George, and with luck, get him a position at court. LADY ELIZABETH excuses herself, and leaves..
NORFOLK: These are difficult times. I have it on good authority that the Queen no longer bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir is still not resolved. It cannot be long before the King is forced to look outside the marriage.
SIR THOMAS: What? And make a bastard King of A legitimized bastard. What choice does he have? Obviously, I've given it thought, and wondered which Howard girl I could put under his nose. Imagine the influence that would give us. To be blood family of the next King of England. Equally, imagine if another family were to achieve the same? NORFOLK indicates SIR JOHN SEYMOUR in the corner, and his two loathsome, ambitious sons EDWARD and THOMAS..

NORFOLK indicates SIR JOHN SEYMOUR in the corner, and his two loathsome, ambitious sons EDWARD and THOMAS..
SIR THOMAS: What about Anne? SIR THOMAS turns, and indicates ANNE across the crowds, who's dancing with GEORGE.
SIR THOMAS: I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not officially a `Howard', but as your sister's daughter..
NORFOLK: But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't you prefer her to have a nice, uncomplicated, respectable marriage? Like Mary?
SIR THOMAS: If Anne were an uncomplicated, respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say `yes'. But she's not. SIR THOMAS looks out at ANNE..
SIR THOMAS: She's anything but.
ADY ELIZABETH: don't like it. It would cost a fortune to make our house fit for a royal visit. Money we don't have.
SIR THOMAS: And what if you were to look on the bright side? Just once? An ominous clap of thunder outside..
SIR THOMAS: Risk nothing, you gain nothing. ADY ELIZABETH stares at her husband..
LADY ELIZABETH: hen was it that people stopped thinking of ambition as a sin, and started thinking of it as a virtue?
SIR THOMAS: Easy for you to say. You've had power and wealth all your life.
LADY ELIZABETH: Until I married you, Thomas. And I was happy to give it up. LADY ELIZABETH turns, and walks back inside.
ANNE: You asked to see me father?
SIR THOMAS: Yes. Come in. SIR THOMAS closes the door.
MARY: o - the King himself is coming to Hever. I'm so happy for George.
ANNE: Yes. But Father took me aside. It seems he has ambitions for me, too.
MARY: What? What are you saying..?
ANNE: It's known the King has a wandering eye. Imagine.if he were to like me?
MARY: But.you could never be more than his mistress. And that's no substitute for a But as the King's mistress the least I'd get after he finished with me would be an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And gave him what his wife has failed to? Quite apart from the money, it'd be a Duke at least.
ANNE: But as the King's mistress the least I'd get after he finished with me would be an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And gave him what his wife has failed to? Quite apart from the money, it'd be a Duke at least.
MARY: But what about your happiness? Your ANNE shrugs, smiles..
ANNE: I could be a happy Duchess.
ANNE: Are you nervous?
MARY: A little.
ANNE: You'll tell me everything in the I promise.
MARY: I promise.
ANNE: No details spared? The two SISTERS hug tightly. Visibly emotional.
MARY: Hold me a moment? WILLIAM CAREY envelops MARY with his arms.. I'm so lucky to have a man who is content with what he has. MARY looks at him.. You are, aren't you? WILLIAM CAREY smiles, looks at his gorgeous bride..
WILLIAM: I am the luckiest man in the world. WILLIAM reaches for the wine.. MARY shakes her head. But WILLIAM tenderly insists.. You should. It will hurt less. MARY nervously drinks.. Lie back. MARY lies down. Then she lifts up her nightdress. WILLIAM pulls down his trousers. MARY extends her hands. Inviting him to join her. WILLIAM slowly lowers himself on top of her. He enters her. MARY smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. A side to her one might not have imagined. But one or two strokes later, and WILLIAM's knuckles whiten, his face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her. MARY looks up. Surely that wasn't it? Thank you.
ANNE: There he is! The young HENRY TUDOR is a dazzling, magnetic, intensely glamorous and handsome figure. A total contrast from the bloated, bearded figure of his later years.
ANNE: You think he will like me?
MARY: Of course, sister. How could he not? ANNE turns to face MARY. The two SISTERS embrace tightly.
SIR THOMAS: Your Majesty, you are most welcome. The King dismounts athletically. His DOGS are unleashed, bark Sir Thomas. Lady Elizabeth.. A SERVANT in stiff, new uniform, with trembling hands, brings wine on a tray. HENRY takes a glass..
HENRY: Sir Thomas. Lady Elizabeth.. A SERVANT in stiff, new uniform, with trembling hands, brings wine on a tray. HENRY takes a glass..
SIR THOMAS: May I present my son, George. GEORGE, visibly nervous, bows deeply from the neck. But HENRY's attention has been caught by a beautiful woman behind GEORGE..
HENRY: ( while staring at MARY ) Your Uncle tells me I should have you at court. Should I?
GEORGE: It would be a great honour, Sir. MARY dutifully, modestly averts her eyes..
SIR THOMAS: And our daughter, Anne. ENRY turns to see ANNE.
ENRY: No one said anything of a daughter. ANNE curtseys deeply.
HENRY: Had we known, we might have come sooner.
ANNE: Your Majesty..
SIR THOMAS: Perhaps you'll allow Anne to show you around our modest house?
HENRY: A pleasure. ANNE offers HENRY her hand. He takes it, then leads ANNE away. MARY shoots ANNE a look, `Good luck'.
ANNE: Here is the library.
HENRY: And through here, the observatory..
ANNE: And through here, the observatory..
HENRY: HENRY looks up, his eye having been caught by something..
H: What's that? HENRY points at an emblem above a doorway..
A: What's that? HENRY points at an emblem above a doorway..
HENRY: What's that? HENRY points at an emblem above a doorway..
ANNE: falcon, your Grace.
HENRY: I can see that. But what's it doing there? More to the point.. ..not just there, but in every corner in the house?
ANNE: I have no idea. Ask my father. Perhaps because falcons are vaguely associative with field sports - field sports with aristocracy - and in the absence of a genuine coat of arms.. .a man with ambition will do the strangest things. HENRY is delighted by ANNE's candour..
ENRY: That's a sharp tongue you have. I wonder what it might say about me behind my back?
ANNE: Oh, his Majesty has nothing to fear from me. Unless he fears an excess of HENRY smiles, visibly charmed..
HENRY: Really? And what would they be..? WATCHING FROM ABOVE, MARY smiles to herself, "Well done, Anne", as HENRY and ANNE continue down a corridor..
K: SIR THOMAS
M: SIR THOMAS
SIR THOMAS: Bravo, Anne! The King was quite smitten! Told me so himself. And has requested you sit beside him at dinner. SIR THOMAS adjusts her hair..
SIR THOMAS: My girl. My dear, remarkable girl. I knew you would up to the task. MARY watches. A momentary stab of jealousy at FATHER's attention. But as ANNE looks over at MARY for support.. MARY smiles. Shakes herself out of it. It's her sister. What was she thinking?
HENRY: Well played! And, may I say.. ..an excellent choice of music too! nowing smiles from the COURTIERS, SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH, the DUKE of NORFOLK, etc..
HENRY: Sir Thomas, Lady Elizabeth, dear Anne. Your health.
H: ENRY raises his glass. Cheers and applause from the COURTIERS. A beaming SIR THOMAS raises his glass.
HENRY: ..I had it from the lips of the Spanish ambassador himself. That our musicians are the envy of all Europe.
BRANDON: ..then he was flattering you, your Our Universities and philosophers, too.
HENRY: Our Universities and philosophers, too.
H: .another lie. That honour would have to go to the Germans.
B: .another lie. That honour would have to go to the Germans.
BRANDON: .another lie. That honour would have to go to the Germans.
HENRY: What of our painters, then?
RANDON: Years behind their Italian counterparts. The truth is far from leading the world, we're a provincial outpost, lagging far What? Is no one proud to be English? Anne? What say you? ANNE gulps. The clanking of cutlery. All eyes on her.
HENRY: What? Is no one proud to be English? Anne? What say you? ANNE gulps. The clanking of cutlery. All eyes on her.
ANNE: Me, my Lord? I know little of such matters, but I've not heard mention of our armies. Undefeated, I believe, in a generation.
ENRY: Well said.
ANNE: Or our navy? The finest in the world.
HENRY: It's true.
ANNE: The universities in Spain and the philosophers in Germany may be strong, but are they really the equal of Oxford and Thomas More?
HENRY: I doubt there is a country that is fairer in Government, or better protected by nature from her enemies, whose people are happier or more She's right, by God! She's right! HENRY is delighted. SIR THOMAS stares proudly across the room at ANNE. Who's hand, we notice, is shaking.
ANNE: I doubt there is a country that is fairer in Government, or better protected by nature from her enemies, whose people are happier or more She's right, by God! She's right! HENRY is delighted. SIR THOMAS stares proudly across the room at ANNE. Who's hand, we notice, is shaking.
HENRY: She's right, by God! She's right! HENRY is delighted. SIR THOMAS stares proudly across the room at ANNE. Who's hand, we notice, is shaking.
A: Her heart pounding in her chest.
I: Her heart pounding in her chest.
T: Her heart pounding in her chest.
S: Her heart pounding in her chest.
SIR THOMAS: You did well tonight. Very well. Quite enough to be invited to court, I am sure of it. SIR THOMAS kisses ANNE's forehead..
SIR THOMAS: Now go to bed. Get a good night's sleep. Because there's still the hunt tomorrow. You must excel at that. SIR THOMAS watches ANNE go. Admiring her. Then he turns to see his wife, ELIZABETH. She turns away in disgust.
F: inally, ANNE comes out. The KING turns..
HENRY: Good morning, Anne. ANNE curtseys deeply..
H: Good morning, your Grace.
B: Good morning, your Grace.
A: Good morning, your Grace.
W: Good morning, your Grace.
ANNE: Good morning, your Grace.
HENRY: ho will you be riding with? It's clearly an invitation. He indicates there is room for ANNE on the back of his saddle. But ANNE fails to read the signal.
ANNE: On my own your Grace.
HENRY: Your own..? A STABLE-BOY leads out her horse.
ANNE: They have invented a new saddle which allows ladies to ride on their own. ANNE skilfully mounts the horse, and sits upright..
HENRY: ut with no man to hold onto? How will you stay on the horse?
ANNE: Why? The same way you hold onto yours, your Grace. A flicker behind HENRY's eyes. It's the first wrong move ANNE has made.
HENRY: We'll see. ENRY yanks the reins on his horse..
HENRY: Let's away! ANNE shoots a look at MARY. Then follows.
HENRY: ( kicking his horse )
R: Up ahead, the HOUNDS start to bark. Their pace increases. They've got a scent. The BUGLER blows his horn.. The DOGS begin to increase their pace. The RIDERS urge their horses to gallop. The LADIES hold tight to their MEN..
T: Up ahead, the HOUNDS start to bark. Their pace increases. They've got a scent. The BUGLER blows his horn.. The DOGS begin to increase their pace. The RIDERS urge their horses to gallop. The LADIES hold tight to their MEN..

HENRY: ( kicking his horse )
IDER: We've lost him. He's in the forest. Galloping through trees and thick forest is not for the fainthearted. But HENRY charges past, kicking up dirt..
HENRY: Then we must follow.
H: INT. FOREST - DAY 26 26 HENRY weaves skilfully through low-hanging branches. He looks over his shoulder, ANNE follows, close behind.. Sharp branches tear at HENRY's face. Some draw blood. Behind him, several other COURTIERS suffer lashes from the branches, and pull up. But not ANNE. She kicks her horse harder. Seemingly impervious to the whipping branches..

ENRY: he King of England defeated by a humble The COURTIERS laugh, then they turn their horses around and head off. ANNE stares. It's a clear opportunity to impress. She looks down at the rocks. A long stare, then..
ANNE: ( suddenly kicking horse )
A: She made it! Exhilarated, ANNE turns, breathing hard. The KING stares at her. The COURTIERS stare at her.
H: She made it! Exhilarated, ANNE turns, breathing hard. The KING stares at her. The COURTIERS stare at her.

COURTIER: Please, your Majesty. It's not safe. HENRY turns and stares daggers at the COURTIER, `Silence'. He stares across the ravine at ANNE. Their eyes meet. hen he kicks his horse, `Hah!', and lurches forward. He heads down the sheer ravine. The COURTIERS gasp, rush to the edge of the ravine to watch. ANNE goes to the edge her side. ENRY's horse slides perilously down the ravine, then struggles to clear the brook, and lands heavily in the water. he KING struggles to keep control, and as the horse tries to scramble up the bank the other side, it loses it's footing in
T: the mud, it's hooves grasping horrifically at air.. The KING's horse falls backwards, unseating HENRY, sending him flying, and worst of all, landing on top of him as they fall and tumble dreadfully down into the brook, and onto the rocks.. Pandemonium breaks out. The sound of shouting voices, cries of horror, raising the alarm. ANNE's FACE: what has she done?
PHYSICIAN: It's a miracle, Majesty, you have no broken bones.. HENRY flinches in agony, tries to move..
SIR THOMAS: My daughter Anne is here. Would like to No! Get her away from me! ANNE opens her mouth, wants to protest, but is hastily ushered out of the room.
ENRY: ( recoils, his pride hurt ) No! Get her away from me!
H: LATER: HENRY's wound is being dressed by MARY.
HENRY: And who are you?
MARY: Mary, your Grace. Anne's younger sister. HENRY looks her up and down..
HENRY: You've been here all week-end?
MARY: Yes, your Grace.
HENRY: Really? How could I have overlooked you?
MARY: Next to Anne, it's easy to do.
HENRY: HENRY sits up, takes H better look. Intrigued.
MARY: Yes, your Grace. To William Carey.
ENRY: From Wolsey's office?
MARY: Yes, your Grace.
HENRY: Then why haven't I seen you at court?
MARY: Because I have persuaded him to spend a year or two here first. We have a small manor and some land. Nothing much. But enough to start a family.
HENRY: A charmed life in the country? Away from it all?
MARY: ( CONTINUED )
M: Everything I would have wished for myself. But then my brother died. And duty called. HENRY looks at MARY, then..
HENRY: Everything I would have wished for myself. But then my brother died. And duty called. HENRY looks at MARY, then..
HENRY: You don't think he'll miss court? A young, ambitious man?
MARY: He says not, your Majesty. MARY lowers her eyes..
MARY: But, if he ever changed his mind, I would always support him. HENRY stares at MARY.
HENRY: Well said.
HENRY: Thank you again, Lady Elizabeth. We'll take good care of your boy.. And Thomas.. HENRY embraces him, whispers in SIR THOMAS's ear..
HENRY: You'll take care of that matter?
SIR THOMAS: Consider it done, your Majesty. HENRY shoots a lingering look at MARY, which ANNE notices. Then the King and his entourage ride off. MARY waves farewell to GEORGE. ANNE stares. Suspicious.

STAFFORD: Your Father wishes to see you. MARY and ANNE get to their feet. STAFFORD raises his hand..
STAFFORD: Just Mary. MARY shoots ANNE a quizzical look, then goes with STAFFORD. ANNE's smile fades. A flicker of suspicion. She follows..
NORFOLK: Mary, I don't know what you said or did - but you obviously made a deep impression on the King.
THOMAS ): And he has requested you come to court with immediate effect. MARY's eyes widen in disbelief..'What?'
ANNE: INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - SAME TIME 33 33 WILLIAM STAFFORD watches from the doorway as the DUKE of NORFOLK, WILLIAM CAREY and SIR THOMAS smile delightedly, staring at MARY..
NORFOLK: ou're to pack and leave first thing in the morning. MARY shoots a desperate look at her husband..
T: The King himself has secured you a position in the Queen's household.
B: The King himself has secured you a position in the Queen's household.
NORFOLK: The King himself has secured you a position in the Queen's household.
MARY: ut I don't want to go to court. Nor does my husband. WILLIAM CAREY clears his throat. Avoids MARY's eyes..
SIR THOMAS: ell her.
WILLIAM: The King has also offered me a position. As Gentleman of the Privy Council.
MARY: SIR THOMAS
SIR THOMAS: Y'hear that? Gentleman of the Privy Council! Attending to the private and personal needs of his Majesty himself! That's the inner sanctum! MARY's shell-shocked, lost for words..
MARY: But what about our future? Here in the Put it out of your mind. From now on your home is at court.
NORFOLK: Put it out of your mind. From now on your home is at court.
MARY: William, please! Don't you understand what this means? MARY stares imploringly..
MARY: They will separate us. Put me in different accommodation. Where the King can always.find me. WILLIAM CAREY averts his eyes..
NORFOLK: Happily your husband understands the value of such an opportunity. For us all.
B: What about Anne? Couldn't she go SIR THOMAS's expression darkens. A flicker of pain.
W: What about Anne? Couldn't she go SIR THOMAS's expression darkens. A flicker of pain.
M: What about Anne? Couldn't she go SIR THOMAS's expression darkens. A flicker of pain.
MARY: What about Anne? Couldn't she go SIR THOMAS's expression darkens. A flicker of pain.
SIR THOMAS: The way that girl behaved this week-end, she can count herself lucky she still has a home.
M: also running down her cheeks. She stares at her husband..
MARY: How could he DO this to me? My own What if we just refused?
WILLIAM: We would be cut off. He made that clear.
MARY: But would that be so bad? MARY stares at him..
MARY: Position means nothing to me. Nor wealth. We could find somewhere. A small farm. Away from everything.
WILLIAM: You say that now - but when you're older? And our children are grown up? This won't last long. A year. Maybe two. And at the end of that - we'll we have everything we want. It's for our FUTURE.
MARY: ut can't you see? Do this, and we might not HAVE a future.
A: EXT. BOLEYN HOME - STABLES - DAY 36 36 MARY is getting ready to leave. She turns a corner and `bang', walks straight into ANNE. A tense moment. The two SISTERS stare at one another..
M: EXT. BOLEYN HOME - STABLES - DAY 36 36 MARY is getting ready to leave. She turns a corner and `bang', walks straight into ANNE. A tense moment. The two SISTERS stare at one another..
MARY: I'm so sorry..
ANNE: What for? You think I want the King? Or to be used and abused by him? No! You're welcome to him. I have my own plans, which don't involve becoming a rag that will one day be discarded. MARY stares, saddened, `Oh, Anne', but there's no time to talk. She has to go. ANNE is left. Her eyes blazing.
SERVANT: Mary Carey, Ma'am. QUEEN KATHERINE looks up..`Who?'
QUEEN KATHERINE: The new Lady in Waiting.
SERVANT: The new Lady in Waiting.
I: P M Really? But I was not expecting anyone.
M: P M Really? But I was not expecting anyone.
S: QUEEN KATHERINE
QUEEN KATHERINE: Really? But I was not expecting anyone.
ERVANT: Appointed by.his Majesty the King.
QUEEN KATHERINE: By my husband? Really? The air crackles with tension. It's school bullying.
QUEEN KATHERINE: Well, then she must be some kind of gift. He must have seen in her some special talent that would please me. Tell me. What special talent is it that you have? Apart from your obvious youth and errified, MARY stammers..
T: errified, MARY stammers..
MARY: QUEEN KATHERINE
QUEEN KATHERINE: oetry, perhaps?
MARY: QUEEN KATHERINE
QUEEN KATHERINE: Or dressmaking?
MARY: QUEEN KATHERINE
QUEEN KATHERINE: Music! That's it! You compose? Or sing?
MARY: ..I'm afraid not. Your Majesty.
QUEEN KATHERINE: Come, you're too modest. Signor Vasquez. The Spanish GUITARIST obliges by starting to play a well-known tune of the period..
MARY: No..really..I beg you, your Majesty.
M: QUEEN KATHERINE ( barks, suddenly terrifying )
W: QUEEN KATHERINE ( barks, suddenly terrifying )
QUEEN KATHERINE: ( barks, suddenly terrifying ) I command you to SING!!!
QUEEN KATHERINE: Bravo! A nightingale! Welcome at court!
WOMAN'S VOICE: ait! Mary! Stop! But MARY does not hear. She continues walking, distressed, and distractedly enters.. Finally, she is caught by JANE PARKER, whom we had seen at the window earlier. Younger, also English, a kindred spirit..
JANE: I know that must have been agony, but put yourself in her shoes. She knows the only reason the King has asked you here is because he desires you. For a wife that must be very difficult. She's a good woman. Trust me. JANE smiles. MARY manages a smile..
J: ANE ( cont'd )
MARY: Mary Carey. The two girls shake hands.
JANE: You have a brother, don't you? George?
J: I've seen him a few times at court. And like him.very well. But I don't think he has noticed me.
MARY: I've seen him a few times at court. And like him.very well. But I don't think he has noticed me.
JANE: I've seen him a few times at court. And like him.very well. But I don't think he has noticed me.
MARY: I can't imagine. Should I mention you to him?
JANE: Would you?
MARY: Of course. Happily. ANE PARKER smiles. But as soon as MARY's back is turned, the smile fades.
GEORGE: Not noticed her? Jane Parker? Of course I have. How could I not? She looks like a goat.
MARY: Well, she likes you, and asked me to give you this..to remember her by. MARY hands over a handkerchief..
GEORGE: Ugh. Well say you haven't seen me. Or that you forgot. GEORGE hastily gives it back.. There is something about that woman that makes me feel. GEORGE gets to his feet, indicates to his MALE COURTIER friend that he is coming..
MARY: And our sister? Any word?
H: ANNE? You know she took being upstaged by you very badly.
H: ANNE? You know she took being upstaged by you very badly.
M: ANNE? You know she took being upstaged by you very badly.
A: ANNE? You know she took being upstaged by you very badly.
GEORGE: ANNE? You know she took being upstaged by you very badly.
MARY: Yes, I know.
GEORGE: And no amount of interventions on my behalf would make her believe you hadn't done it intentionally.
MARY: But you KNOW I would never do anything like that.
GEORGE: I know. GEORGE finds his helmet, puts it on.. Just give her time. She'll come round. MARY watches GEORGE go to join the other MALE COURTIERS.
ENRY: I wanted to find somewhere we could be alone so I might say a few words to you in person. ENRY turns, looks around the room..
HENRY: I hope your accommodation is comfortable. I realise it's no substitute for the life you had in mind in the country.. But please, give me the opportunity to try to make you happy here..
N: ( a beat ) NRY( cont'd )
M: ( a beat ) NRY( cont'd )
HE: The moment I met you, I realised I.. HENRY tails off as MARY unbuttoning her dress..
HENRY: ( tailing off ) What are you..?
HENRY: I am sorry. You obviously misunderstand me. HENRY bows in respect, then turns, and takes his leave, leaving MARY standing in the room..
NORFOLK: What? If all the King wanted was coition, he could fetch in a woman from the bath house. What he wants is YOU. To woo you. And be wooed in return. And could'nt you look just a little happier? There isn't a girl in the Kingdom that wouldn't wish to be in your Your opinion, Uncle. MARY speaks quietly. Lowers her head..
MARY: Your opinion, Uncle. MARY speaks quietly. Lowers her head..
MARY: Mine is that it's the greatest insult of Asking a whore to have feelings, too.

MARY: Now it's your turn.
HENRY: To say something, or do something you couldn't outside.
MARY: To say something, or do something you couldn't outside.
HENRY: There are many things I cannot admit to in public. Sadness, for example. And But when you are loved as much as you are? How can you be lonely?

HENRY: Imagine how different it might have been. For both of us..had we been able to chose for ourselves.. HENRY leans forward and they kiss. Gently at first. MARY resisting. Then harder.. ensing this, the KING picks MARY up and leads her to the canopied bed, and lays her down.. They begin to make love. As radical a contrast to the scene with WILLIAM CAREY as it is possible to imagine.. MARY's eyes open. She gasps. Her hands grip the sheets..

NORFOLK: MARY stares at her husband..
NORFOLK: Did he have you? MARY's eyes burn..
MARY: More than once? MARY stares daggers..
NORFOLK: More than once? MARY stares daggers..
NORFOLK: You'd better get used to talking about it. Once you sleep with the king, it's not a private matter any more.
MARY: Yes. More than once. WILLIAM CAREY's face: a flicker of pain..
NORFOLK: So he was satisfied?
MARY: I believe so, Uncle.
B: ood. This is where our work begins. It's one thing to catch the king. Quite another to keep him. NORFOLK turns to SIR THOMAS, ignoring MARY as though she were a piece of livestock..

She must know her music, must be energetic and entertaining - in company and in bed. That's how he likes his women. And if ever she's in any doubt as to how to conduct herself, or what to do next - she should simply watch the Queen. That woman kept him from straying for eleven years. And the effort almost killed her. ut SIR THOMAS has not heard. He is distracted. He watches from a palace window as, in a stableyard down below.. GEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON return from riding together. The sound of laughter as they dismount, and hand their horses to the SIR THOMAS watches as GEORGE and FRANCIS walk back to the palace together. There's something in their manner, the intimacy between them.. SIR THOMAS's smile fades.
HENRY: The biggest warship in the fleet. Thirty- two guns and two hundred feet long, and with your permission Thomas.. ..I'd like to name her after your daughter. The "Mary Boleyn". SIR THOMAS looks up in disbelief..

SIR THOMAS: Yes, your Majesty.
HENRY: Do you have anyone in mind?
SIR THOMAS: There is one lady, Sir..
HENRY: Go on..

I: .that she has fallen in love.
M: .that she has fallen in love.
P: resently, she emerges from the bathroom. White-faced. Her hands instinctively covering her belly. MARY's eyes widen with the implications.

SIR THOMAS: n that case.I suppose.someone should tell the King.
L: SIR THOMAS
G: SIR THOMAS
SIR THOMAS: Now open! MARY removes her blindfold. She gasps in disbelief, turns 360 degrees, staring at the size, and grandeur of the location..
SIR THOMAS: There's more. Thanks to you, I am to become an Earl. Your brother a Viscount. EORGE smiles at MARY, who's eyes widen.. In addition, we have received a number of new grants and estates.
ELIZABETH ): So our debts are paid off. But LADY ELIZABETH remains granite-faced..
LADY ELIZABETH: Just be aware. These `gifts', this `favour' can go as swiftly as it comes. These rooms belonged to the Duke of Buckingham. Once the King's closest friend. Now his head rots on a spike..
SIR THOMAS: Because he committed treason.
ADY ELIZABETH: But what is `treason'? It's anything the King or his lawyers decide it to be. Anything that offends him, or causes him And can you assure me we'll never do LADY ELIZABETH turns and walks out. MARY looks anxiously at SIR THOMAS, who gestures dismissively..

HENRY: I know. But the most important thing is a healthy child. ENRY takes MARY's hand.. I'll come and see you as often as I can. I promise.
H: ENRY kisses MARY, then goes.
F: She has been well trained. But she makes no impact on HENRY. He waves the SEYMOURS away. Not remotely interested.
NORFOLK: For the moment he's still visiting Mary. But for how long? The Queen will soon have his head spinning with pretty little Spanish things. Not to mention the Seymours with that girl of theirs. NORFOLK looks up.
NORFOLK: What we need is someone from OUR family who will keep the King focused on Mary, reminding him of her while she is SIR THOMAS is about to speak, then changes his mind.
NORFOLK: What? Speak..
SIR THOMAS: It's just.I was going to suggest Anne.
NORFOLK: You couldn't control that girl last time. What makes you think it would be any different now?
SIR THOMAS: I've had favourable reports from the Dowager Queen in France. It seems she is quite changed.

M: Sitting beside her in the darkness, is her brother GEORGE..
MARY: Sitting beside her in the darkness, is her brother GEORGE..
GEORGE: I suppose they felt three years of exile was punishment enough.
MARY: But the King visits me every day. There's no need for her. Or anyone else.
GEORGE: They just want to protect you. Leave nothing to chance.
MARY: But in who's interests do they imagine Anne will act? Certainly not mine. GEORGE turns, looks all around him.. Why DO they make this room such a dungeon? Does it really need to be this GEORGE notices MARY's vexed expression..
GEORGE: Don't worry. She's had three years to forgive you. And she's not going to risk being sent away again. She'll do as she's told, I'm sure. Besides, the most important thing is.. GEORGE moves MARY's lips into an upward shape..

H: ENRY looks up, then returns to his conversation. It's not long before another loud gale of laughter in the corner of the room. HENRY looks up again. Then returns to his resently, a third roar of laughter at the other end. This time, HENRY loses patience..
HENRY: What's the noise? I can hardly hear myself think! At the other end, a COURTIER gets to his feet..
BRANDON: It's Mistress Boleyn, your Majesty. Her stories about life at the French court. They are particularly amusing. HENRY's expression changes. The room falls silent..
HENRY: I'm only aware of one Boleyn girl and she is lying-in with a certain child in her belly!

SIR THOMAS: It's my elder daughter, Anne, your Majesty. She has returned to court.
HENRY: What? That awful girl, Thomas? The one that almost killed me? You allowed her back?
SIR THOMAS: The time abroad has done her good, your Majesty. I'm certain you'd find her much HENRY looks down the table..
HENRY: HENRY looks down the table..
HENRY: Well, come on. Where are you, other Boleyn girl? Show your face. ANNE slowly gets to her feet. HENRY looks up. When he sees ANNE's face, his face falls.. ANNE is a woman transformed. Gone are the simple clothes, puppy fat and lack of confidence. ANNE has become a glorious, head-turning siren; dressed in daring French clothes. er hood is half-crescent, and reveals the hair. Her neckline plunges sexily. Her sleeves are long and loose, offering daring flashes of arm and elbow.. Like every other red-blooded MAN in the room, HENRY is utterly mesmerised. Speechless..
HENRY: So? What is so amusing, Anne? Perhaps we might hear and judge for ourselves? ANNE dark, intelligent eyes stare back at HENRY. Suddenly, all sound fades, and the world shrinks around them: it's as though they are the only two people in the room..
ANNE: I was just giving my thoughts on the new French King.
HENRY: Which are..?
H: That for someone with such great wealth, and power..he has surprisingly little authority as a man.
R: That for someone with such great wealth, and power..he has surprisingly little authority as a man.
R: That for someone with such great wealth, and power..he has surprisingly little authority as a man.
ANNE: That for someone with such great wealth, and power..he has surprisingly little authority as a man.
HENRY: And is SO consumed by one particular rivalry he can barely think.
ANNE: And is SO consumed by one particular rivalry he can barely think.
HENRY: eally? And who is this rival?
ANNE: A neighbouring King, who's name one is forbidden to mention at court. Whose reputation haunts him in his thoughts and dreams. ipples of laughter, as people guess..
ANNE: Whose armies and navy thwart his every endeavour. Whose physical and intellectual endowments are known far and wide. ENRY laughs too. Enjoying this..
ANNE: In order to restore his confidence, this French King spends a fortune on anything that glitters, on building of castles with large towers.. ANNE artfully gestures the phallic implications..
ANNE: But these symbols of wealth and virility fail to convince. Talk among the ladies at court in France suggests..
A: That in this department too, the King has his shortcomings. ANNE's gesture, ( discreetly wiggling her small finger ). HENRY stares for a moment. A deathly silence. Has she gone too far?
HENRY: That in this department too, the King has his shortcomings. ANNE's gesture, ( discreetly wiggling her small finger ). HENRY stares for a moment. A deathly silence. Has she gone too far?
ANNE: That in this department too, the King has his shortcomings. ANNE's gesture, ( discreetly wiggling her small finger ). HENRY stares for a moment. A deathly silence. Has she gone too far?

SIR THOMAS: You should have seen the Seymours! Their MARY lies in bed. Sitting by her side is her father..
SIR THOMAS: They must have thought that with you out of the way, they had a real opportunity with that pale-faced thing of theirs, SIR THOMAS smiles as he remembers.. But Anne put pay to that. Last night, the King only had eyes for us Boleyns. MARY shoots a private, knowing look..
MARY: Or HER, you mean.
SIR THOMAS: 'm wary of any suggestion that Anne would serve anyone but herself. France can't have changed her THAT much.
MARY: 'm wary of any suggestion that Anne would serve anyone but herself. France can't have changed her THAT much.
SIR THOMAS: n this occasion I am quite satisfied she was being loyal to you.
MARY: MARY stares hollow-eyed..
H: .then why hasRY( conot dcome to see me since she returned?
H: .then why hasRY( conot dcome to see me since she returned?
HENRY: You're a fortunate man, George. To be blessed with G
EORGE: Yes, my Lord. There is a powerful physicality, a sexual confidence to HENRY which he exudes, even among men. He moves closer to GEORGE.
ENRY: Tell me. Are they as different in temper as they are in looks?
GEORGE: Oh, yes. Each has her own, quite distinct virtues. Mary for example..
HENRY: I'm familiar with Mary's. Tell me about Anne? Well, she's strong. Some might say Headstrong. With a fiery temper.
GEORGE: Anne? Well, she's strong. Some might say Headstrong. With a fiery temper.
ENRY: Headstrong. With a fiery temper.
GEORGE: But with it comes great passion, too. It's both the best and the worst thing about her. There are no half measures with Anne.
HENRY: Careful, you'll make me think I chose the wrong Boleyn girl.
A: 8 A
S: 8 A
GEORGE: Oh, no. I'm certain Mary is the right choice. You will have a serene, happy, life with her. The risk is with Anne, it might be like being caught in a wild summer storm.
HENRY: Is that so..? GEORGE has tried to put HENRY off. But might just have said the wrong thing.
HENRY: storm, you say..?
ERVANT: From the King, madam. ANNE looks at the box. Her heart misses a beat. It carries the unmistakable royal seal.
ANNE: Open it. A SERVANT stares..
ANNE: I said `open it.' The SERVANT opens it. Other SERVANTS crane their necks, stand on tiptoes. Inside is a large pearl pendant. The SERVANT gasps. ANNE, too. Covers her mouth. It's beautiful.. But from somewhere, she manages to find the strength..
ANNE: Now close it again. And send it back. The SERVANT stares in disbelief.. You heard me. The SERVANT bows, and leaves, taking the box. ANNE watches, a look of mischief in her eyes. She's up to no good.
HENRY: She did what?
SERVANT: Sent it back, your Grace. HENRY's face. Confounded..
HENRY: Sent it back?
HENRY: What? Again?
H: INT. CORRIDORS - COURT - DAY 88 88 `Crash', the KING, flanked by several of his most intimidating COURTIERS, bursts through doors, and storms along a corridor. It's an impressive sight.. People scatter to get out of the way.

HENRY: Your daughter. Where is she?
LADY ELIZABETH: INT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - DAY 90 90 ANNE hears the KING's voice. Her eyes widen. She looks down. Sees HENRY. ANNE smiles privately - it's confirmation that her strategy has worked.

HENRY: You received my gifts?
ANNE: And? They did not please you?
HENRY: And? They did not please you?
ANNE: On the contrary, my Lord. They pleased me greatly.
HENRY: Then why did you return them? Now ANNE opens the door. She appears wearing a stunning outfit..
ANNE: ecause my sister lies in bed with your child. If you wish to please me, Sir, then send her the gifts you send me.
HENRY: I have shown Mary enough kindness and generosity. It's you I want, Anne.
ANNE: beg you, my Lord, do not do this. What has changed so?
HENRY: YOU. Don't you see? YOU have changed.
ANNE: But Mary is still the mother of your child. And even if she weren't..
ENRY: How could I forget that you chose her above me when we first met? You liked her better.
ANNE: How could I forget that you chose her above me when we first met? You liked her better.
HENRY: Not true..
ANNE: Either way, I could never betray my own
A: ( a beat ) NE( cont'd )
T: ( a beat ) NE( cont'd )
AN: Now I beg you, leave me. This is too difficult to bear.
HENRY: You see! The same pain as mine! It proves you feel the same way!
ANNE: Perhaps. But since it can never come to Let me decide that. For now, you have given me hope.
HENRY: Let me decide that. For now, you have given me hope.
H: ENRY goes on bended knee, kisses her hand, and goes. ANNE is left alone. She breathes out. Then looks down at her hands. hey are shaking.
STAFFORD: Sir Thomas! It's Mary..!
SIR THOMAS: Does the King know?
A: He's on his way. ANNE, who overhears this, surreptitiously adjusts her dress. MARY screams in agony. The labour is well and truly under way. Medically, it's a primitive, brutal affair.. No comprehension of sterilisation. MIDWIVES have dirty hands. PHYSICIANS use rusty, blood-stained instruments.. Presently: the KING arrives with several COURTIERS..
GEORGE: He's on his way. ANNE, who overhears this, surreptitiously adjusts her dress. MARY screams in agony. The labour is well and truly under way. Medically, it's a primitive, brutal affair.. No comprehension of sterilisation. MIDWIVES have dirty hands. PHYSICIANS use rusty, blood-stained instruments.. Presently: the KING arrives with several COURTIERS..
SIR THOMAS: Any moment, your Grace. But the KING hasn't heard. He has seen ANNE. Suddenly, it's as if all sound, all vision disappears, except for ANNE. He stands beside her.. All around them the violence and dramatic activity of the birth unfolding; but for all their connection with it, HENRY and ANNE might as well be in a rose garden..
HENRY: ANNE stares ahead at MARY's bed..
HENRY: Anne, I love you..
ANNE: Your Grace, this is not the time..
HENRY: I love you Anne. I cannot stop thinking about you. I cannot eat, I cannot But how could I ever TRUST you? NORFOLK cranes his neck to listen..
ANNE: But how could I ever TRUST you? NORFOLK cranes his neck to listen..
ANNE: When I have seen how you have betrayed first your wife. And now my sister. HENRY takes ANNE to one side.
HENRY: I vow from this moment forth I will never lie with my wife, or speak to your sister again. I will do anything you MARY's contractions build. Birth is imminent. PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES work to deliver the baby. ANNE thinks, then..
A: MARY's contractions build. Birth is imminent. PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES work to deliver the baby. ANNE thinks, then..
A: MARY's contractions build. Birth is imminent. PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES work to deliver the baby. ANNE thinks, then..
ANNE: Then don't acknowledge the child. HENRY is thrown..
HENRY: With a blood-curdling scream, MARY finally gives birth. SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK crowd into the room, anxious to see..
PHYSICIAN: A boy! SIR THOMAS turns towards HENRY, beaming with happiness..
SIR THOMAS: It's a boy, your Majesty. A strong, healthy boy. HENRY's face: a boy? His eyes fill with emotion. This is what he has waited for. A son. ANNE notices his conflict, and prompts him again..
ANNE: What my sister has given you, I could, HENRY looks at the BABY, then turns to face ANNE. His eyes are full of conflict, then..he silently nods. ANNE's face breaks out in a smile..
ANNE: Very well. Then, in front of everyone, not caring how inappropriate it is, HENRY falls to his knee, takes ANNE's hand and kisses it. The audible sound of gasps. MARY watches in horror as HENRY falls to his knees and kisses ANNE's hand..
M: ( a dagger in her heart ) My Lord..?
MARY: ( a dagger in her heart ) My Lord..?
L: Instead, MARY's eyes meet ANNE's. ANNE's eyes stare back. The ultimate moment of revenge. The MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS stare at one another, visibly embarrassed by what they have just witnessed. The clearing of throats, averting of eyes. Then they get on with their work to the sound of the MARY's cries..

NORFOLK: Damn you! Three years we've been working on this! Not a single detail was left to chance! And now, in the moment of our greatest glory.. NORFOLK stares at ANNE..
NORFOLK: All I can say is you'd better have a plan. And it had better work. ANNE stares back defiantly..
ANNE: Or what.Uncle?
LADY ELIZABETH: Stop it! Both of you. What shall we do about Mary? And the child? Or have we forgotten them already?
ANNE: Mary should go back to her husband. Not a flicker of emotion on her face.
ANNE: She has been inconvenienced long enough by this family.
ADY ELIZABETH: Fine. Then you can be the one to tell ADY ELIZABETH stares at ANNE..
A: LADY ELIZABETH
LADY ELIZABETH: I think you've earned that privilege. LADY ELIZABETH turns and walks out. ANNE's smile fades.
MARY: How can you show your face in here?
ANNE: I understand you're angry - but be assured. I did nothing, except remind him of you.
MARY: Oh, spare me. You did this deliberately. As revenge. And now you have what you wanted you probably think justice has been done.
ANNE: Well, hasn't it?
MARY: Be careful, that's my advice. Learn from my experience. Because he'll only do to you what he has done to me.
ANNE: Never. I'll make sure he understands I'm a greater thing by far. That he can never have me until he makes me a far greater offer.
O: You'll never get Henry Percy back, if that's what you mean.
MARY: You'll never get Henry Percy back, if that's what you mean.
ANNE: That's not what I mean. ANNE's eyes burn with anger..
ANNE: And don't you ever mention his name to me again. I'll never forget how you betrayed me.
MARY: If that's what you think, fine. Tell yourself that.
ANNE: I did, sister. Every day for three ANNE turns, and walks out.
W: EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY 103 103 The rain continues. MARY's carriage approaches the manor house. At one time this was everything she wanted. Now it's a prison.
W: Have you christened the child?
WILLIAM: Have you christened the child?
MARY: I see. A painful smile..
WILLIAM: I see. A painful smile..
WILLIAM: And is he to take my name? Or is he to be a Fitzroy or some other sign that he is a royal bast.
MARY: He is to be Henry Carey.
WILLIAM: I see. A silence, then..
WILLIAM: Well, then, here we are. WILLIAM stares at MARY. Clearly still in love with her.
WILLIAM: I could pretend none of this ever happened. Start again. If you could. MARY's face. Manages a brave smile.
A: After a short, frenzied thrashing..he climaxes, then as before, rolls over and falls asleep. MARY stares at the ceiling.
H: After a short, frenzied thrashing..he climaxes, then as before, rolls over and falls asleep. MARY stares at the ceiling.

HENRY: Well, I have done what you asked. Will you give yourself to me, now?
ANNE: As what?
HENRY: My one true mistress. To whom I am loyal above all others?
ANNE: But it's not true. You are loyal to the QUEEN above all others.
HENRY: My wife? I barely see her.
ANNE: But she sits on a throne beside you. Accompanies you to every state function.
ENRY: For appearance sakes only. In every other regard, our marriage is a sham.
ANNE: Still, she is your WIFE. And ever present. And I feel her eyes on me. And those of her spies. ANNE nervously looks left and right..
ANNE: And look at us. Forever reduced to meeting in secret like this. Speaking in Hardly conducive to passion?
H: Well, what would you have me do?
HENRY: Well, what would you have me do?
HENRY: Wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for the Queen to be sent to a nunnery. HENRY kisses ANNE on the neck..
HENRY: She will protest, of course. She won't go quietly, but she knows she has failed to give me a son, and deserves her Which leaves you all alone at court.. He begins to unbutton her dress..
HENRY: .queen in all but name. Mother to any future heir. ENRY unbuttons and kisses lower, lower.
HENRY: So, is this assurance enough? Will you give yourself to me now? A flicker behind ANNE's eyes, then..
ANNE: I'd like to. But I'm afraid I find the insult too much to bear.
HENRY: What insult?
A: B ( Because as long as we remain unmarried, any child I gave you would forever be daubed `bastard' and I a `whore'.
A: B ( Because as long as we remain unmarried, any child I gave you would forever be daubed `bastard' and I a `whore'.

ANNE: Because as long as we remain unmarried, any child I gave you would forever be daubed `bastard' and I a `whore'.
ENRY: ut what alternative is there? My love for the Queen may have died, but even you must concede, she is still very much alive. A
ANNE: Katherine of Aragon is alive. That woman is not worthy of the title `Queen'.
ENRY: Oh, Anne.
ANNE: I really do not know why we waste time talking of convents when you could annul the marriage.
HENRY: Annul it?
ANNE: That woman married two brothers and therefore sinned against God.
HENRY: But she never consummated the marriage with my brother.
ANNE: They were married six months.
HENRY: Arthur was a sick man.
ANNE: And Katherine is a shrewd woman who knew that her position as Queen would never be safe until she bedded your brother. Talk to your advisers. They will tell you as much. ANNE walks out. HENRY stares.
M: Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen?
S: Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen?
I: Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen?
T: Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen?
Y: Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen?
HENRY: Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen?
ANNE: But that's wonderful. ANNE's smiles, then notices..
ANNE: Why do you look sad?
HENRY: Because she will contest it. Which means putting her on trial. And hearing these delicate matters in public.
ANNE: es. But any court made up of YOUR Bishops will surely find in YOUR favour. And declare the marriage invalid. Now it's ANNE's turn to start kissing HENRY round the neck..
ANNE: hen you, my sweet Lord, will be free to Then I can give myself to you fully. And give you everything you.. ANNE stops, leaving HENRY highly aroused..
TAFFORD: She's beautiful.
MARY: Thank you.
S: I brought gifts from your family. A night-dress from your mother. This from your Uncle George. STAFFORD produces a small wooded sword from behind his back. Little HENRY takes the sword. Swooshes it with excitement.

MARY: Please be sure to thank them - though one wonders what's kept them so busy that not a single one of them found time to visit the new baby.
STAFFORD: It's Anne. She's turning this country on its head. She has persuaded the king to test the validity of his marriage, and put the QueenM on trial.
MARY: She continues to hold out. Expertly witholding her favours until.
STAFFORD: She continues to hold out. Expertly witholding her favours until.
MARY: ..until what?
STAFFORD: Until he makes her the ultimate offer. MARY's eyes widen..
MARY: High stakes indeed.
MARY: And my brother George?
TAFFORD: Continues to be promoted. As does your Father. I lost track of their latest STAFFORD smiles. Mounts his horse..

HENRY: The Queen has insisted a Papal representative be present at the trial. But Wolsey has assured me the trial will proceed for appearance sake only. We have our verdict.

Looks down to see a small ARMY. t the centre of everything: an grand, old, bearded ARCHBISHOP climbs down from an opulent carriage.
MARY: ho's that?
SIR THOMAS: The Papal Legate. Sent by the Pope to preside over the Queen's trial. MARY looks first at ANNE, then back out as the long procession dramatically enters the Palace Gates.

ANNE: The crowds have no vote. And the bishops that do are in Wolsey's ANNE watches as KATHERINE enters court. The QUEEN sees ANNE, and starts walking directly towards them.. God, she's coming towards us. QUEEN KATHERINE walks towards the screen, reaches it, then
Q: UEEN KATHERINE ( a beat )
UEEN KATHERINE: So..the Boleyn whores. Two former ladies of mine. Hiding in shadows. What did I do to upset you, that you should turn against me like this?
ANNE: You failed to give England an heir.
QUEEN KATHERINE: And that upsets you so?
ANNE: What upsets the King upsets me. QUEEN KATHERINE straightens. Big mistake.
QUEEN KATHERINE: How dare you!
CRIER: ( calling out ) Katherine, Queen of England, come into
QUEEN KATHERINE: ou want me to creep away and become a nun? Well, I shall not. You want me to lie before God and admit my first marriage was consummated? Well, it was You want me toUEEN KATHERINE( cont'd ) daughter's claim as sole rightful heir to the throne? Well I shall not. Not in a thousand years, not if you rack me to within an inch of my life. I am Katherine, Queen of England, the King's one true wife, and mother of the heir to the throne. Beloved of the people, and beloved of a King you have KATHERINE turns and enters the packed courtroom. She makes no reply to the CRIER, instead walks over to where the KING sits, and falls onto her knees.. MARY looks at ANNE, who is visibly shaking. And tries to compose Throughout the courtroom, people exchange looks. Gasp. KATHERINE is completely disregarding the court, Campeggio and Wolsey, and appealing directly to her husband..

KATHERINE: My Lord, how have I offended you? For twenty years, I have been a true, obedient wife. I have loved all those whom you loved, and given you children though it has pleased God to take them away. If there is any just cause that you can allege against me, I will happily depart to my shame and dishonour, but I tell you, as God is my witness, there is none. ENRY sits in silence, but can barely contain his rage. So, I beg you, dear husband, to spare me this humiliation. But if you will not, and I am to be tried..
HENRY: ( defiant ) You are.
KATHERINE: ..then let it be in a proper court and by the only authority I recognise. His holiness himself. An audible gasp from the court. HENRY shoots a look at WOLSEY, `What?!?' WOLSEY is horrified, `I know nothing of this.' KATHERINE gets to her feet, and dramatically walks out of the court, stopping only to pause by a window..
A: The cheers from the loyal PEOPLE who are waiting outside ring through the court. HENRY looks dark, thunderous. He storms out of court. WOLSEY watches, visibly shaken.

L: The cheers from the loyal PEOPLE who are waiting outside ring through the court. HENRY looks dark, thunderous. He storms out of court. WOLSEY watches, visibly shaken.
WOLSEY: Since it has pleased the Queen to absent herself from the court, the trial will simply proceed without her. A LAWYER gets to his feet. The trial begins..
ANNE: Wolsey promised the King his verdict. Instead he has humiliated him.
SIR THOMAS: But they are continuing with the trial. And the Bishops will still find in the King's favour.
ANNE: Yes. But without the Pope's blessing, the result will seem hollow. If only the King would take matters into his own hands.
ADY ELIZABETH: And do what? His only option would be to reject the Catholic Church? And his faith would never allow it.
SIR THOMAS: Nor his good sense. Breaking with Rome would isolate England politically. Leave us at the mercy of the Protestants.
ANNE: But the alternative is leaving this country without an heir. Failing in his duty as a King. And risking civil war. ANNE stops thinks..
S: omehow I need to make him understand that it is a fair price for a legitimate ANNE looks at MARY..
I: ANNE ( cont'd ) ANNE ( cont'd )
M: ANNE ( cont'd ) ANNE ( cont'd )
MARY: ( becoming suspicious )
HENRY: Who's this? ANNE smiles, maternally strokes the boy's hair..
A: Go, on..
ANNE: Go, on..
YOUNG HENRY: My name is Henry.
HENRY: Is it, now? A fine name. And how old are you?
YOUNG HENRY: Four, Sir. REVERSE ANGLE: to see MARY watching helplessly from inside the palace. Tears are streaming down her face. LADY ELIZABETH appears, and puts her arm round MARY's shoulders in comfort.. OUTSIDE: in the gardens, YOUNG HENRY and his father continue to get to know one another.. Is that sword real?
HENRY: I think so. Would you like to see it? HENRY draws it, and shows the boy, who's eyes widen in Now, `on guard'. HENRY and YOUNG HENRY begin to play fight. As they do, our CAMERA slowly, slowly pulls back to reveal.. The scene is being watched by: MARY, her nose pressed against a window in the palace, as she continues to watch HENRY play with her SON..

KATHERINE: How dare you! Take your hands off me.. The GUARDS drag the QUEEN away, her heart-breaking kicking and screaming continues. As she disappears.. We REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: this is being watched shadows by the KING himself.. His face: burning with guilt and self-loathing.
HENRY: Now you will give yourself to me. ANNE looks up..
ANNE: I thought I had made myself clear. Until we are married, there is no questi..
HENRY: Silence! Enough of your GAMES! I have torn apart this country for you, gone against every principle in my heart, I've endured the doubts and counsel of good men and silenced them with the axe.just to be with you.. HENRY tears her dress. He forces himself on top of her.
A: Now prove to me it was worth the He pushes her back against a table, slamming her down, and enters her roughly. ANNE cries out in pain..
HENRY: Now prove to me it was worth the He pushes her back against a table, slamming her down, and enters her roughly. ANNE cries out in pain..
ANNE: Stop, you are hurting me..!
ANNE: How was he with you? As a lover?
MARY: a beat ) Surprisingly so. a beat )
ANNE: No reason. OVER THIS we FADE IN: the sound of bells ringing..
ARCHIBISHOP: ( in LATIN, we see sub-titles ) Do you, Henry Tudor, take Anne Boleyn as your lawful wedded wife..?
HENRY: I do. Their voices are almost drowned by the SHOUTS of protest and dissent coming from the streets..`Whore', `Witch'.
A: A party is in progress. ANNE, the bride, is at the centre of proceedings, visibly pregnant and finally Queen. But it has brought her no peace. The cacophony from outside visibly troubles her. MARY stands by her side. Maid of honour.
H: A party is in progress. ANNE, the bride, is at the centre of proceedings, visibly pregnant and finally Queen. But it has brought her no peace. The cacophony from outside visibly troubles her. MARY stands by her side. Maid of honour.
S: A party is in progress. ANNE, the bride, is at the centre of proceedings, visibly pregnant and finally Queen. But it has brought her no peace. The cacophony from outside visibly troubles her. MARY stands by her side. Maid of honour.
ANNE: Did you hear? On the way to the church? They were calling me a witch.
MARY: All that will die down as soon as they get to know you.
ANNE: But what if it doesn't? What if they hate me forever?
MARY: They won't. They will see how much the King loves you, and follow.
ANNE: ( haunted, hollow ) How much the King loves me?
MARY: ister, I wonder if you've given any thought..to the matter of my returning to the country. With the children. ANNE's face: her expression changes. Suddenly fearful.
ANNE: What? No! I need you here more than ever. Besides, as the Queen's sister, you can't live alone out there like some gypsy. We need to make you a proper earing this, the passing WILLIAM STAFFORD freezes..
ANNE: What about the Duke of Suffolk? ANNE indicates an ugly, fat COURTIER..
ANNE: All the ladies at court are mad for him. Or Lord Fardingly. Marry him and you'd own half Scotland.. WILLIAM STAFFORD's face.
M: INT. COURT - ACCOMMODATION - DAY 143 143 MARY is walking back to her apartments, when WILLIAM STAFFORD runs after her, appearing in the corridor behind her..
S: INT. COURT - ACCOMMODATION - DAY 143 143 MARY is walking back to her apartments, when WILLIAM STAFFORD runs after her, appearing in the corridor behind her..
W: INT. COURT - ACCOMMODATION - DAY 143 143 MARY is walking back to her apartments, when WILLIAM STAFFORD runs after her, appearing in the corridor behind her..
STAFFORD: Wait! Mary.. STAFFORD catches her up..
STAFFORD: I couldn't help overhearing. And before you agree to any of your sister's matches, let me just say.. STAFFORD takes a deep breath. His heart racing..
STAFFORD: ..I have saved money.not a lot.but enough. I've my eye on a place in the West.Tatton.near where I grew up.. MARY turns, an incredulous look..
MARY: ( surely this is a joke )
STAFFORD: Mary.I love you. There..I've said it. From the moment I joined your family..
MARY: MARY looks at him. A lightening flash of recognition. She's heard those words before, and puts two and two together..
M: It was you, wasn't it? At the masked Oh, Stafford..
MARY: It was you, wasn't it? At the masked Oh, Stafford..
STAFFORD: Oh, Stafford..
MARY: Oh, Stafford..
STAFFORD: Mary..I have watched how your family has treated you.
G: If you came withFFORD( cwould )never betray you.or take you for granted..I would love you and cherish you to my dying day..
S: If you came withFFORD( cwould )never betray you.or take you for granted..I would love you and cherish you to my dying day..
M: If you came withFFORD( cwould )never betray you.or take you for granted..I would love you and cherish you to my dying day..
MARY: But it's impossible. You know that. Now Anne's Queen, my family would never allow it.
STAFFORD: And you would CARE? What THEY think? After everything they have done to you? TAFFORD stares incredulously. Then goes.
ANNE: God, I look hideous.
EORGE: Does it hurt?
ANNE: Little nips and stabs. MARY isn't listening. She is lost in thought.
GEORGE: Just imagine. It it's a boy. The unholy trinity will be mother, uncle and aunt to the next King of England.
ANNE: But if it isn't? The King will take that as evidence of God's displeasure. And will turn further against me. He's already become so cold. ANNE touches her stomach anxiously..
ANNE: They say you can tell by the shape of the stomach. Mary, what do you say? Boy or girl? ANNE tails off when she sees MARY. Miles away.
ANNE: What's the matter with her? MARY looks up, `What?'
M: You've been like this for days.
ANNE: You've been like this for days.
MARY: Mooning. You're not in love, are you?
ANNE: Mooning. You're not in love, are you?
MARY: ( blushing ) Certainly not..
MARY: ( flustered ) In love!
MIDWIFE: And again, one more.. ANNE pushes again. MARY holds her. ANNE howls in agony. Her nails dig into the sheets. A last, primal, blood-curdling roar of pain..
MIDWIFE: It's done, your Majesty..!
MARY: Well done. PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES swarm around the baby. ANNE, despite having lost a great deal of blood, tries to sit up..
ANNE: It's a girl! MARY takes the child from the MIDWIFE, holds it for ANNE.
MARY: It's a girl! MARY takes the child from the MIDWIFE, holds it for ANNE.
MARY: A beautiful, healthy girl.
H: ANNE is overcome by maternal love, but realises what this will mean. She stares at the baby. Fear filling her eyes..
ANNE: A girl?
SIR THOMAS: She has named her Elizabeth. After your Is the child healthy?
HENRY: Is the child healthy?
SIR THOMAS: Perfectly, Sir. HENRY stares, hollow-eyed. Finally..
ENRY: Well, if we can have a healthy daughter, we can have a healthy son. HENRY turns, and without a word, pushes past everyone, and leaves. ANNE is left alone, her heart breaking.. MARY stares at ANNE. A stab of compassion. Not long ago the same thing happened to her. Hoping to console ANNE, MARY hands her beautiful new BABY over to her. ..ANNE takes the BABY in her arms. Filled with love for something that will almost certainly mean her destruction. Her shoulders shake with tears.
A: Who is it? MARY leaves the BABY, goes over to the window. Looks out. Down below, HENRY is walking with an attractive young LADY..
ANNE: Who is it? MARY leaves the BABY, goes over to the window. Looks out. Down below, HENRY is walking with an attractive young LADY..
MARY: Lady Somerset, I believe.
B: Yesterday it was the wife of the French Ambassador. The day before with the Countess of Salisbury. How could he DO that to me? So SOON? ANNE stares at MARY..
A: Yesterday it was the wife of the French Ambassador. The day before with the Countess of Salisbury. How could he DO that to me? So SOON? ANNE stares at MARY..
ANNE: Yesterday it was the wife of the French Ambassador. The day before with the Countess of Salisbury. How could he DO that to me? So SOON? ANNE stares at MARY..
ANNE: Now I know how it must have been for ANNE reaches for MARY's hand. Their hands touch. Briefly. Then MARY pulls away her hand, still not quite ready to forgive.. And goes to tend to the crying BABY ELIZABETH..
ANNE: I struck him today. What am I doing? I am destroying this all on my own.. ANNE looks left and right. Makes sure no one is within earshot. Goes to check outside her door, then returns..
ANNE: I can't sleep at night! And without sleep I cannot think!
U: Oh, Anne..
M: Oh, Anne..
M: Oh, Anne..
A: Oh, Anne..
MARY: Oh, Anne..
ANNE: nd it's getting more and more difficult to arouse him. Some nights he cannot do it.at all. I have to resort to ever more disgusting.then he hates himself in the morning.hates me even more for what I made him do. ANNE eyes stare. She rocks back and forth..
ANNE: It's slipping away, Mary. I can feel it. MARY takes ANNE's hand. Envelops it in hers.
SIR THOMAS: The PHYSICIAN's face: he nods.
L: The KING threads his way through COURTIERS and ENTERTAINERS. Wherever he goes, people stop their conversations, bow in fear. ANNE, visibly pregnant, sits on a throne. Alone. She looks drawn, frightened, and tired. An unmistakable echo of QUEEN KATHERINE at the masked ball earlier.
G: The KING threads his way through COURTIERS and ENTERTAINERS. Wherever he goes, people stop their conversations, bow in fear. ANNE, visibly pregnant, sits on a throne. Alone. She looks drawn, frightened, and tired. An unmistakable echo of QUEEN KATHERINE at the masked ball earlier.

EORGE: And so, it's come to this. Our sister is with child, and all England's fate is in the balance. EORGE indicates ANNE.. If it's a boy, the King will have been vindicated in getting rid of his first wife, and his authority will be unassailable. But if it isn't. Or if, God forbid, she miscarries. EORGE indicates HENRY, who's face is also drawn, dark, malevolent, suspicious. Barely recognisable.
GEORGE: The King will have to move swiftly to silence his enemies. He will claim innocence. That he was corrupted. Anne will swiftly be replaced as Queen, by someone more `acceptable'. And we Boleyns will never be able to show our faces at court again.
MARY: That's no bad thing. MARY shudders to herself. Holds her children protectively.
MARY: Anyone with any sense would have run away from this hell-hole already. As far as they could go.
GEORGE: ike the wise William Stafford. MARY turns.
MARY: You didn't know? Sold up and went. Left for the country. Just like that. Gone to live in some place called..
GEORGE: You didn't know? Sold up and went. Left for the country. Just like that. Gone to live in some place called..
A: ( under her breath ) Where he grew up, apparently. Did you know he came from a better stable than all of us? His grandmother was a Beaufort, cousin to the King. And he never mentioned it. ( shrugs ) Who'd have guessed?

EORGE shrugs, and skates off with FRANCIS WESTON. We pull back to reveal they are being watched by JANE PARKER.. ..who looks drained. Lonely. Worn out by the humiliation of her failed marriage and the agony of unrequited love.
ANNE: I'm fine, thank you. Just a bad dream. Reassured, the SERVANTS fill ANNE's glass with water..
ANNE: ( flinches as she speaks ) But fetch my brother and sister, will
W: hen ANNE sees what lies beneath, she howls in horror.
T: I lost it. Almost without pain. And so fast it was over in a moment. MARY looks down at the bundle of sheets..
M: I lost it. Almost without pain. And so fast it was over in a moment. MARY looks down at the bundle of sheets..

MARY: ( heart cracks ) Oh, Anne..
ANNE: ou have to get rid of it. Bury it. Get rid of it somehow. No one must know. EORGE rushes to a cupboard, and pulls out a cape. He wraps it around ANNE. Then he pours wine into a glass. MARY wraps ANNE in a blanket to warm her. And begins making the bed with fresh AN HOUR LATER: ANNE is composed. Staring into the fire. MARY and GEORGE sit on either side of her.
ANNE: It's not the first. Miscarriage. MARY's heart cracks. Takes ANNE's hand.
ANNE: They will take it as proof that I cannot bear children. That I am cursed by God. And should be dispensed with.
MARY: Why? There's still time. You could sleep with the King, and fall pregnant again. No one would know..
ANNE: he King would never lie with me now, and risk damaging the `child' he believes I'm carrying.. Besides, he is barely capable anymore. And I couldn't go through that again. ANNE stares at MARY and GEORGE..
ANNE: No, if I am to survive..I have to take matters into my own hands. MARY and GEORGE exchange blank looks..
B: I..I don't understand.
MARY: I..I don't understand.
ANNE: I need a baby, Mary. Must I spell it out?
MARY: You mean lying with another man?
ANNE: Of course.
GEORGE: But that would be treason.
MARY: esides, where would you find someone you could trust?
ANNE: Obviously, it would have to be someone close. Very close.. ANNE stares meaningfully at her BROTHER..
GEORGE: horrified )
MARY: Stop it, Anne! It's madness..
ANNE: Don't you see? This affects all of us. If I go down, so do all of you. The only way to save ourselves..is to do this.. And pray it's a boy. MARY covers her mouth in horror, gets to her feet..
MARY: I can't listen to this.. .this is monstrous..
ANNE: Mary, sit down..
MARY: No, Anne! I understand you have had a shock tonight. A terrible shock. But there is no need for this..
G: MARY reaches the door, turns to GEORGE..
MARY: Come, George.. GEORGE gets to his feet..
ANNE: George is staying. He understands this involves the whole family..
MARY: No. Come, George..
ANNE: George, is STAYING! EORGE freezes..
MARY: ( her heart cracking ) I pray for you both.
ANNE: Mary! Come back!
I: t's JANE PARKER. Who turns, holding her head, covering her ears, unable to listen to any more..
MARY: Come on, darling wake up.
YOUNG HENRY: Where are we going?
MARY: Away from here. Far, far away.

T: STAFFORD's eyes. MARY's eyes.
M: STAFFORD's eyes. MARY's eyes.
MARY: I'm sorry. I just didn't know where else to go. STAFFORD walks in. MARY gets up. No modesty. No shame. No effort to cover herself. STAFFORD sweeps her into his arms.. No words. No explanations. Time for that later. hey fall into a passionate embrace, and sink to the floor..
RIEST: Do you, Mary, take William as your lawful wedded husband?
MARY: I do.
MARY: What is it?
STAFFORD: News from court. TAFFORD avoids MARY's eyes..
Y: hat? It's Anne. Tell me.. She miscarried the child?
M: hat? It's Anne. Tell me.. She miscarried the child?
M: hat? It's Anne. Tell me.. She miscarried the child?
M: hat? It's Anne. Tell me.. She miscarried the child?

STAFFORD: They say it was deformed.monstrous. She is charged with incest and of summoning the devil. Your brother, too. He has already been sentenced. Anne is in the Tower, awaiting trial.
MARY: I must go. MARY turns to walk out. STAFFORD blocks her path..
STAFFORD: And do what? George is doomed. For Anne it's only a matter of time.
MARY: I can petition the King..
STAFFORD: ou think he will listen? It's his own neck he's saving by getting rid of them, can't you see? MARY stares..
M: Fine, go. But if you do, you might as well kiss your children goodbye. You are Anne's sister. That alone makes you her accomplice and co-conspirator.

MARY: I have no choice. Anne and George are my family. I cannot desert them. MARY walks towards the door..
STAFFORD: And what of your new family? Your
CHILDREN?: Henry and Catherine have you. Anne and George have no one. I'm sorry..
MARY: Henry and Catherine have you. Anne and George have no one. I'm sorry..
ANNE: It is a sad day for England when the nobles do not rise for their Queen.
NORFOLK: And even sadder when that same Queen is charged with adultery and incest.
ANNE: Charged is different to convicted, Uncle. Or is it not? In this court? Deathly silence. The clearing of throats. Then with much chair scraping, the NOBLES reluctantly get to their feet..
NORFOLK: Master Cromwell, read out the CROMWELL gets to his feet..
CROMWELL: The charge is that in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of our Sovereign Henry, King of England, his wife, the Queen, being seduced by the Devil, did knowingly commit adultery, high treason and offences against God.
NORFOLK: How do you plead?
ANNE: Not guilty, my Lord.
A: ANNE faces the LORDS, as she makes her case..
ANNE: My noble Lords..the love I have for my brother is the love any sister would have for someone with whom she has grown up in the same house, nursed when sick, played games as children, shared life's As ANNE delivers this speech, our CAMERA slowly pulls back, back, towards the door..
ANNE: That is the love I have for him. Not what you suggest. Our CAMERA pulls out through the door. ..and into a corridor beyond, where we find HENRY hunched in shadows, eavesdropping, his face cast in shadows..
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT 187 187 MARY gallops through shallow streams, spraying water..
NORFOLK: ( unflinching )
NORFOLK: In which case, the burden falls on me to pass sentence.
W: MARY's expression changes. Suddenly, a shiver goes down her spine. MARY feels sick. Fearing the worst, she goes up to a WOMAN in the CROWDS..
MARY: ho was it?
HENRY: The SEYMOUR BROTHERS draw their swords, but the KING's DOG runs excitedly towards her. HENRY gestures for the SEYMOURS to sheath their swords.. H
ENRY: Leave us. The SEYMOURS leave. The DUKE of NORFOLK hesitates..
HENRY: ALL of you! NORFOLK shoots MARY a look, then goes. HENRY turns and leads her INT. PRIVY CHAMBER - DAY His private room. His sanctuary. Where he took her before. The room to which only MARY seems to have had access..
MARY: Your Majesty.. I understand my family has offended you. But having taken my brother today, I beg you to spare my sister.
HENRY: Oh, Mary.
H: I realise you must replace Anne as But must she die, too?
H: I realise you must replace Anne as But must she die, too?
H: I realise you must replace Anne as But must she die, too?
MARY: I realise you must replace Anne as But must she die, too?
HENRY: She has been tried and found guilty.
MARY: You could send her away.
ENRY: I am bound by the law.
MARY: You could send her to a nunnery. No one would know.
HENRY: Anne? To a nunnery? HENRY almost manages a smile.
MARY: There is precedent, my Lord. Louis of France did it, too. When his wife could not conceive.
HENRY: The French Queen was a blameless woman. Your sister a witch.
MARY: I understand Anne has offended you. I ask only that if there is any regret you might..feel yourself.
ENRY: For your part in the matter.. MARY treads delicately. Realising the very suggestion is ..does not unduly colour your thinking. Killing Anne will not make it go away. It would only make it worse. ENRY stares at MARY..

G: Suddenly his eyes are full of regret. And sadness.
H: Suddenly his eyes are full of regret. And sadness.
HENRY: o. I will reflect on the matter. MARY falls on one knee. Kisses his swollen, bejewelled hand in gratitude. HENRY stares, watching her as she goes.
MARY: Oh, Anne.. The two sisters walk towards one another, and embrace. Tight. Tears run onto each other's shoulders..
ANNE: How has it come to this?
MARY: EXT. TOWER GREEN - DAY 197 197 A LIEUTENANT gives a nod. SOLDIERS raise a barrier, and allow the CROWDS that have been waiting to rush forward. coats.reserving seats..anxious to secure the best views.
ANNE: They're letting the crowds in.
MARY: It's all right. You will be spared. The King as good as gave me his word.
