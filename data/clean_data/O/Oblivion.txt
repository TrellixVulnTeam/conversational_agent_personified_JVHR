OBLIVION: Written by William Monahan Current Revisions by Karl Gajdusek Based on the story by Joseph Kosinski
VICTORIA: Today we will be running support on five Resource Gatherers working the seaboard. Coordinates coming to you. now. Please do confirm. On Jack's heads-up display, five icons glow to life.
JACK: Yeah, I got 'em. You got 'em, The Bobblehead bobs.
VICTORIA: Drone perimeter defense is intact, although one went offline last night. How's the drop?
JACK: Oh, you know. Same ole' same. In front of Victoria, almost a hundred years of technological advances. Most prominent a MAP overlaid with environmental, meteorological, radiation levels. Other screens stream cam-footage from the Bubbleship.
VICTORIA: Alright, you're blind in five, four, three. INTERCUT WITH JACK IN THE BUBBLESHIP. JACK watches the cloud wall RUSH UP at him.
JACK: You should come with me sometime.
VICTORIA: No, thank you. Have a nice ride. The Bubbleship HITS CLOUDS, goes completely blind. Just vapor and water HAMMERING the canopy like bullets. On the heads-up display, GPS numbers roll. The readouts deal with climate, terrain below. Even in this hell, Jack takes the controls, starts to pilot on instruments. One of Victoria's boards flashes. She squints as a large MASS forms near Jack's ship.
JACK: What do you call this? What does a storm look like inside a storm? Like this. The WALL OF WEATHER comes out of the wind and rain from behind Jack's ship, simply eats it up. Suddenly Jack's going end over end, helpless. Warning lights flash. Jack punches controls that won't respond.
JACK: ( under his breath ) "Talkin' 'bout my girl." Jack shifts the Bubbleship, in the distance a series of RESOURCE-GATHERERS on the horizon. Essentially titanic vacuums, sucking up the oceans. In front of her console, VICTORIA charts the Gatherers, and the patrol arcs of their defensive Drones. One blinks, stalled.
VICTORIA: Okay, we've got another Drone downed last night.
JACK: Send it. NUMBERS FIRE across the heads-up. Jack touches a button. A BAR GAUGE begins to fill, like a street racer turning on the NOX before dragging.
VICTORIA: Would you like to set a course to reserve fuel?
JACK: ( SMALL SMILE )
VICTORIA: Yo no se. No data. It's not ( checking the map ) Tet coverage will go live in 11 2015 World Champions."
JACK: You know, I actually read about this game. Giants are literally on their own seven with 25 seconds on the clock.
VICTORIA: Please do not reminisce on my Comm, thank you very much. He puts the Bubbleship into a soft descent. Victoria observes it on her console.
JACK: Anyway. QB lets off this mile- high bomb. The weather's fast and erratic like this. As Jack starts moving towards the Drone, a heavy mist forms, shrouding it in grey. There's almost no sound, just Jack's feet on The thing just sails the length of the field. Victoria anxiously checks a screen, the arc of the Tet's "vision" still not covering Jack's location.
VICTORIA: Jack I have no scope. The Tet is still offline. He pauses. A faint sound on the wind. like a whine.
JACK: And at the one yard line. interception. Devastation. It's all over.
JACK: But the guy's too eager. He starts running it back. Everyone's yelling "Fall down, just fall down!" Jack goes to his knees, examining it, his hands expertly locate an empty tube-like space on the side of the Drone.
VICTORIA: What do you mean taken? Was it a Jack looks at the casing. beaten, pried open? He glances at the ground around him, the dark tunnels. REVERSE ANGLE. From inside a caved-in tunnel entrance, Jack looks small, vulnerable. Something watches Jack.
JACK: No. It's a master drone, too. 166. Looks like it was hit mid flight, managed to limp its way here. Watch my back, I'm starting field repair. INTERCUT: VICTORIA AT SKY TOWER. Glances at the arc of the Tet's vision - still six minutes away.
VICTORIA: Jack, you need to get out of there. Bring it home to the shop. Jack has a panel open. He pulls a lead from the sleeve of his suit, connects it to a board. We see FLIGHT DATA transfer to the Bubbleship.
JACK: So the guy keeps running. 30, 40, 50 yards and BAM! He gets pasted. Ball goes loose.
VICTORIA: Jack, you know they can weaponize a fuel cell. Now a DRIVER shoots out of the tool cuff of his suit.
JACK: ( STARTING WORK )
VICTORIA: I'm reading the whole central core off alignment, you don't have the necessary tools. Jack's got an arm and half his chest inside. He takes his CHEWING GUM, presses it in next to a board. Systems go green on Victoria's console.
JACK: ( calling to the ship ) Bob, I said I needed. He turns to find that the ROVER is already there, a DEUTERIUM FUEL CELL sitting in its payload bay. A SOUND now reaches Jack. Distant, an animal in pain? Jack listens, but it's gone. He slots the cell. A HUMMMM as the Drone powers up, systems coming online. Jack looks around at the stadium.
JACK: Hey there, boy. Easy. Jack moves forward, hand out.
VICTORIA: Jesus, Jack. What the hell was INTERCUT VICTORIA. The Tet's scanners finally giving her a high-rez thermal view of Jack. Her display burning red from the residual plasma fire.
JACK: ( SPITTING ASH )
VICTORIA: Jack, what happened? Nowtrudging to the ship:
JACK: I'll see you at the house later. You want anything? Milk? Bread? Anything else that doesn't exist?
VICTORIA: He leans against the ship. Smiles tired. It's a nice thing to hear.
JACK: Well if you want anybody else, you're out of luck. He boards the BUBBLESHIP.
VICTORIA: We only have two more months, Jack. Please try to resist the urge to do something stupid.
JACK: ON JACK. The captured Drone data right there in front of him on the heads-up. He's too curious.
VICTORIA: There's no Drone signal there.
JACK: One day when we get to Mars, someone will want to know about this. From someone who was here. He stares at the HUGE columns of water draining upwards.
VICTORIA: It's not doing anyone any good JACK nods, starts to turn away when something GLINTS on the horizon. He raises the Binocs, PANS to a gallows- like structure. He ZOOMS, but it is still unclear.
JACK: Actually I've got a bit of a problem with a gyro here, call you when I've fixed it. He releases a catch, pulls a WHITE RECTANGULAR CASE from a slot in the Bubbleship. He kneels down, hands working expertly, producing a full UNFOLDING MOTORCYCLE. As Jack locks the rear wheel in place, the bike HUMMS to life. He gets on and opens up the throttle, rooster- tailing off. The bike's electric, but it MOVES.
JACK: .There you are. An instant of BLACK. And we're suddenly looking at Jack THROUGH ALIEN BINOCULARS. High tech, symbol readouts changing. Something is watching him.
JACK: Vika, you're not going to WHITE NOISE on the comm. There's no signal down here.
VICTORIA: Mission, this is Lieutenant Victoria Kohl, requesting Drone intercept at coordinates sending Her AUDIO goes through a SCRAMBLING PROCESS, then is uploaded where a few seconds later its receipt is acknowledged: STATUS: "APPROVED." She stares up at the map, sees one of the Drones turn towards Jack's location. She settles back, watching.
JACK: ( CONTINUED )
JACK: ( AD-LIBBING EXPLETIVES )
EXPLETIVES ): That was my bike!! He kicks at the dust, the rocks, curses at the pain as he's reminded of his injured leg. He stares at the long walk ahead, the wall of wind and rain that now hits him, soaking him. He starts walking.
VICTORIA: Check your seven. Jack touches his controls and the Bubbleship Canopy REVOLVES so Jack's facing away from the direction he's traveling in. Low on the HORIZON, the TET floats in the sky. It's setting, glows a dull orange, like a Harvest Moon. INTERCUT VICTORIA. She's leaning back in her command chair, her feet propped on the console, also staring out at the Tet. Strangely quiet. In Jack's face a curious mixture of nostalgia, and confusion. This small metal planet is his home.
JACK: Goodnight, folks. See you back here tomorrow. Same time, same He punches the throttle, and screams across the tops of the clouds through the beautiful light, arriving at.
VICTORIA: ( not looking at him ) You're not supposed to bring up surface items. JACK sips water, then waits even longer before.
JACK: No. I'm not supposed to bring them in the house. He's right. He exchanges his water for a glass of something stronger, and goes and sits down.
VICTORIA: I tried to reach you earlier. If we're going to be an effective
TEAM: You're right.
JACK: You're right.
VICTORIA: Then you can't just Jack leaps up, only to return a second later with a small bundle held together by an old rag. He hands it to her, pleased, watching her reaction. She opens it to reveal a small GREEN SEEDLING in a pocket of fresh, rich soil. Her eyes play over it.
JACK: Ah-ha. So it's okay when I bring you something. But if I She MOVES suddenly, opening one of the glass doors of the Sky Tower and heading outside where she holds the seedling away from her body, off the edge, lets it drop.
VICTORIA: I know you think I'm a stickler for the rules, but you have no idea what sort of toxins could be in something like that. He chuckles.
JACK: It was just a plant, Victoria.
VICTORIA: That's not the point. We have two more months and the last thing we need is you putting it all at He shakes his head, grimaces as he limps away.
VICTORIA: This is gonna pinch a little.
JACK: Hit me. She activates the wand, shines ultra violet light onto the substance. A beat, then he BENDS OVER in pain. Through the healant we see the FLESH begin to knit and repair. Skin and sinew literally regenerating. to new.
VICTORIA: ( AFFECTIONATE )
VICTORIA: .I'm not saying you can't go into your caverns, I'm saying we have a job and if I'm trying to reach you and you're off on one of your adventures
JACK: Look, they trained me to fix drones. That's my job, I get that. But it's not what I am. I can't simply do the same thing over and over again, every day, with that. world down there. ( toasts the sky ) And if mission has a better Drone tech, they can get him to baby- He gets up, tries out his leg. Stiff, but healed.
VICTORIA: It's only a little while longer. The Gatherer's have collected most of the resources we need for Mars. Pretty soon
JACK: Pretty soon, there won't be anything left down there. No more plant life, no more water.
VICTORIA: You act like there's not a war going on down there but there is and we can't leave even two of those things alive.
JACK: Actually, it was like they were trying to. catch me. ( trying to joke ) Guess I look tasty. He goes over to her, puts his arms around her.
VICTORIA: Please be careful. If they get to you, what happens to me? JACK puts a finger to her lips, then kisses her.
JACK: Come on.
VICTORIA: Can you imagine when we go back up? Having a face to face conversation again? I can't believe it's finally ending.
JACK: It's not so bad down here. They certainly don't have anything like I wonder what duty I would have pulled. Probably programming the Mars boats.
VICTORIA: I wonder what duty I would have pulled. Probably programming the Mars boats.
JACK: I'd have been overhauling the zero- G toilets.
VICTORIA: It's awful. Just thinking about it, I get afraid. She LAUGHS, reaches for her wine, accidentally knocks the glass which tips over, and rolls right off the Sky Tower. They watch it disappear into the darkness below.
JACK: It's awful. Just thinking about it, I get afraid. She LAUGHS, reaches for her wine, accidentally knocks the glass which tips over, and rolls right off the Sky Tower. They watch it disappear into the darkness below.
VICTORIA: ( SUDDENLY )
JACK: Here, let me show you. He reaches up PULLS her into the pool. She screams, laughing as she goes in. She surfaces, pulling her soaking shirt over her head and tossing it to the side.
VICTORIA: I should have seen that coming. Jack smiles, then takes a breath and goes under. He floats face-down, staring through the bottom of the pool into the lightening-stung clouds below. .and then Victoria's form glides underneath him, looking up at him, smiling. She stops moving and her body rises towards his. He opens his arms, and she floats up and against him. They embrace, kiss. Two bodies, intertwined underwater, a thousand feet above a roiling thunderstorm. Their lips part, he pulls back to look at her . But it's the BRUNETTE WOMAN who stares back at him!!
VICTORIA: Don't go out today until we get a Jack looks back. She's never said this before. She's genuinely worried.
JACK: .Then what would you say in your Victoria looks away, stuck.
JACK: One, Two, Three. Jack Harper. Lights sparkle across the board. Activation sounds. Jack hits switches. Outside, protective barriers lower. The stratospheric wind VIBRATES the bubbleship.
JACK: Just thinking I'd take Bob manual for the dust-off. Feeling the A hundred terraformed acres on Mars is all you have to think INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS VICTORIA stares out from her windows above the clouds.
VICTORIA: A hundred terraformed acres on Mars is all you have to think INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS VICTORIA stares out from her windows above the clouds.
VICTORIA: ( TO HERSELF )
JACK: Already she's got the signal analyzed on six different screens. No matches.
VICTORIA: ( TROUBLED )
JACK: Don't be embarrassed, there's always a first time.
VICTORIA: On its way. Be careful, okay?
JACK: All right, I'm coming up to the Jack begins flying slowly up the twelve hundred foot wall of falling water which almost seems to conceal a Petra behind its veil. Jack reaches the top. JACK'S POV - THE SPIRE AND OBSERVATIONAL DECK of the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, now part of a cliff, set in shifted sea-bed, a gushing river pouring past.
JACK: ( under his breath ) New York, New York. It's a wonderful town. The Bronx is up, and the Battery's down. He can hear nothing over the wind and the water. He moves to the balcony edge, looks "downtown" at the sunken city. A Venice set in a matrice of rubble and sea-bed.
VICTORIA: Jack, you're right on top of it. What do you see? Jack starts a circuit of the deck. A pile of old deck chairs in his way, he pushes at them with his foot. finds a WIRE, running below them, linked to two CAR BATTERIES, hidden under the rubbish. He traces the path of the wire. up.
JACK: Bob, give me audible on this Almost immediately from the Bubbleship comes the intermittent electronic SQUACK of the signal.
VICTORIA: What did you find?
JACK: It's an old radio system. It's been reactivated.
VICTORIA: Define reactivated. Jack looks at the batteries, the wire.
JACK: It's the Empire State
VICTORIA: It's ancient history, Jack. You know the procedure. Blow it. He pulls several CHARGES from the Bubbleship's storage, starts to set them. He pauses, staring at the railing, the old telescope. Change of plans. He walks towards the batteries, a blade sliding out of the cuff of his suit. He reaches them and SEVERS the lines. The signal dies.
VICTORIA: Check your course, you're headed right at the border.
JACK: Yeah, I may have seen another drone trap.
INTERCUT VICTORIA: She checks her map. Jack's Bubbleship is headed straight at a large red swath of territory marked out, toxic radiation levels constantly monitored. A small ALARM goes off in the Bubbleship cabin.
VICTORIA: You're at the edge of range, Jack. You're starting to break up.
JACK: It's okay
VICTORIA: ( SERIOUS )
JACK: will cook me from the inside before I know it. Don't worry, I'm still more than five clicks from the beacons. IN THE BUBBLESHIP. A BIGGER ALARM goes off, Red skull- and-crossbones flash across the heads-up. Jack DIVES the ship, down over huge rocky outcroppings. Jack, intent on piloting. Static. Some GARBLED SOUNDS. Victoria's voice barely coming through.
VICTORIA: What are you out there The signal goes to pure static as Jack steers into a steep canyon, rock on all sides. Barely room to squeeze, but Jack's not worried. This is all familiar.
JACK: That's right, Bob. You know where we're going.
VICTORIA: Victoria works the panel, upping signal, boosting reception. The static is again MIXED WITH GARBLED SOUNDS. She listens, confused, ups the volume. BLIP! That signal from the Empire State starts again. This time it LOCKS ON, a loud and continuous electronic EXT. CRATER LAKE - DAY JACK's ship emerges from a canyon into a beautiful landscape we have never seen before. This is Jack's SECRET PLACE. TREES exist on an island surrounded by clean water. And near the shore, a GROTTO, a carved-out portion of the hillside, supported with scavenged timbers, protected by plastic tarps. A ton of gear is piled inside. JACK has been scavenging for a long time. The BUBBLESHIP lands. JACK walks into the structure, slapping on a relay from a SOLAR GENERATOR. All around are young growing plants, including small yellow flowers and their GREEN SEEDLINGS the same Jack gave to Vika. Jack kneels down by an old military JAMMER. He checks a screen: the Crater Lake location is being jammed.
VICTORIA: Jack? Jack, I really need you EXT. CRATER LAKE - DAY A RECORD PLAYER is taped into his solar power system. An EARLY METAL POWER-BALLAD floats out of the speakers. Jack has a basketball hoop lashed to a pole. He shoots hoops by himself, the ROVER retrieves the ball. LATER. Jack brings a single CHAIR out in front of the water. He sits, and with care produces the books he's brought with him. He opens one with burnt edges:
VICTORIA: Mission, this is Lieutenant Victoria Kohl, requesting a link. I may have a situation. A beat while the connection is made, then.
VICTORIA: I have a rogue signal of unknown origin. I'm sending you a relay.
VICTORIA: ( loathe to admit ) Technician is. experiencing technical difficulties. She winces, that wasn't the greatest lie. Waits.
VICTORIA: Yes, we're an effective team.
VICTORIA: ( SUDDENLY )
VICTORIA: Will communicate findings on next Tet cycle. Understood. Victoria clocks off. Stares at the border area on the map where she last saw Jack. A KLAXON goes off in her workspace. Victoria STARTS. For the first time she seems confused as she works the console. She can't immediately figure it out. Suddenly she brings up a WIDE SCAN for tracking the Tet, The whole Eastern Coast of the continent. And something is closing, coming over the poles, FAST.
JACK: So, um. Victoria. The ROVER shifts, confused.
WOMAN'S VOICE: JACK's eyes snap open. It is much later in the day. He scrambles to his feet, breathing hard, remembering SOMETHING. something desperate.
JACK!!!: JACK's eyes snap open. It is much later in the day. He scrambles to his feet, breathing hard, remembering SOMETHING. something desperate.
BOOM!: What appears to be A METEOR streaks across the sky, leaving a trail of flame and white smoke. Jack grabs his binocs and traces the meteor path. resolves it just barely as the shuttle, crashing down. It disappears over a rise, a beat, then a FIERY
JACK: Bob! Let's get going! The Bubbleship is already powering up by the time Jack piles in. He touches a control and the ship shoots up into the air.
JACK: Vika? Vika, did you get that? An object hit near here. A ship.
VICTORIA: Where the hell have you been? Jack's silent, not wanting to lie. INTERCUT VICTORIA, looking at streaming info from TET.
JACK: I saw it through optics in the last minute. I'm not sure it was Turn around, Jack. The Drones will handle the situation.
VICTORIA: Turn around, Jack. The Drones will handle the situation.
JACK: The Drones'll kill anything that Just for once wait for your orders on this one, Jack. This is Jack is silent, unsure. The crash site growing closer.
VICTORIA: Just for once wait for your orders on this one, Jack. This is Jack is silent, unsure. The crash site growing closer.
JACK: You heard me. Another hard beat. Jack hating this but.
VICTORIA: You heard me. Another hard beat. Jack hating this but.
JACK: Negative. I'll report when I get to the site.
JACK: I'm here, and it's definitely one of ours.
VICTORIA: I'm not confirming this from the I'm confirming it. I'm right Vika works her displays, scanning, wanting to keep him safe. The wreckage has strewn out thousands of flaming pieces of debris, all which register heat signatures.
JACK: I'm confirming it. I'm right Vika works her displays, scanning, wanting to keep him safe. The wreckage has strewn out thousands of flaming pieces of debris, all which register heat signatures.
JACK: SVUNK! SVUNK! Behind Jack, plasma rounds impact the Pod with the man in it, the metal going nova, collapsing.
OKAY: SVUNK! SVUNK! Behind Jack, plasma rounds impact the Pod with the man in it, the metal going nova, collapsing.
NO! 1!: Cannon fire erupts all around him! TWO DRONES settle on the site, their weapons kicking out energy, locking on and destroying Pods.
JACK: There are people here, and they're killing them! Victoria opens her mouth to respond. She can't.
JACK: Get out of here! Go away! Get! A moment of insane bravado, Jack un-shoulders his weapon, strafes the Drone with gunfire which knocks it back. It re-centers, weapons chugging with energy. INTERCUT VICTORIA. Staring at the feeds. A screen catching a half-image of Jack firing at the Drone. She's absolutely still, holding her breath. Jack stares at the Drone, at certain death.
JACK: It's you.
JACK: Open it! Victoria obeys, opens the glass doors. WIND fills the living room as Jack hauls the Pod in. Then Victoria touches a control and the walls SEAL.
VICTORIA: ( RATIONALIZING )
MACHINERY: She came off a NASA shuttle. The drones were specifically targeting the pods
JACK: She came off a NASA shuttle. The drones were specifically targeting the pods
VICTORIA: I don't know what the machinery did or didn't do. There's Protocol? Protocol?! Who's the machinery now, Victoria? VICTORIA stares at him. Then retreats from the question into the task at hand. She kneels by the Pod.
JACK: Protocol? Protocol?! Who's the machinery now, Victoria? VICTORIA stares at him. Then retreats from the question into the task at hand. She kneels by the Pod.
VICTORIA: Go get the cutter, and a breather, and my big bag. Now. The Pod's been damaged, she's not doing well, let's get her out of there. Jack moves. Victoria, almost holds back, but.
JACK: I know it does. And when we report it, we'll also report that drones slaughtered the other human survivors from one of our ships. See what they make of that. He goes for the equipment. Victoria stares at the woman's face, deeply unsettled. Jack returns with Victoria's bag, and firing up a CUTTER.
VICTORIA: Right there, be careful. Jack directs the blue arc towards a seal. The Pod depressurizes with a sudden exhale of dead air. Jack pulls back the pod door. Inside, the woman lies in a gauzy sleep suit. Her hair is matted. Her body looks frail, her skin translucent, veins dark, lips blue, like a drowning victim. Vika pulls her feeding tube, takes her pulse, checks her eyes, lifting the lids.
JACK: You're safe. You're in a skytower, on Earth.
WOMAN: Victoria gives a sharp look at Jack. He's stunned. Now completely exhausted, the woman SLUMPS into unconsciousness. Jack catches her. Victoria comes close, slides an oxygen breather mask over her face.
VICTORIA: We need to get her cleaned up.
VICTORIA: We have to get her up to the Tet.
JACK: I know.
VICTORIA: I don't have the facilities here. Once she's stable.
JACK: I know. The glass door slides open behind them. Neither move.
VICTORIA: What's going on? He shakes his head. He has no idea.
VICTORIA: Here. Drink this. You're dehydrated. You've been in a very bad crash. Your ship came This DISTURBS the woman. She tries to sit up.
WOMAN: What about the others? How did you get out?
VICTORIA: What's your name?
WOMAN: .Julia. Julia. The woman, JULIA, sinks back down, exhausted.
VICTORIA: You need to rest quietly. You've been in delta sleep for a long How long.?
JULIA: How long.?
VICTORIA: Best guess? About 65 years. Julia takes that in.
JULIA: Where's Jack.? Julia STARTS. Looks down at her arm where Victoria has just slid a needle under her skin. She stares at her, almost afraid. Victoria depresses the plunger.
VICTORIA: EXT. SKY TOWER - NIGHT SEEN FROM AFAR. The Sky Tower a lonely refuge in a roiling storm, turning on its axis, like a weather-vane And we PLUNGE DOWN. Down and down, to the base of the SKYTOWER, to see.
VICTORIA: Tomorrow, I'll report that we have Jack nods, but won't look at her. Deep in thought.
JACK: It's a Greek funeral vase. Which I want my ashes in, incidentally. Victoria collects the dishes, heads for the kitchen.
VICTORIA: Jack, please. This isn't why we're here. This is just what we have to do before our real lives begin. We've given them five years and now we get to go home.
JACK: And what if I can't? They stare at each other, each obscurely frightened.
JACK: I read these books, of what it was like down here, before. He sits, his legs dangling into the water. She pulls up close, her arms on the side.
VICTORIA: I know. That was the world before. Your little obsession.
JACK: What was so wonderful about life on the Tet? She looks away.
JACK: She turns and grabs him, desperate.
VIKA: She turns and grabs him, desperate.
VICTORIA: Please. Please. Don't you understand? We have a chance to be on the first boats out, to be the first to settle Mars, raise a family. Five years. Proof that we are an effective team.
JACK: I don't know if it is or not, Victoria. I can't remember. She starts to reply. has nothing. Shakes her head. She grabs blankets and pulls them around herself, her back to him, her eyes open, scared. Jack also lies down, staring upwards. And then Jack asks the 64,000 dollar
JACK: It's beautiful, isn't it? It's your home now.
JULIA: A bit more. located.
JACK: What was your shuttle's mission? She turns to him, watches him carefully in the dim light. And then, lying:
JULIA: I don't remember. I should get back to the ship. I might be able to find the flight recorder.
JACK: Your ship. it's pre-war.
JULIA: ( again, careful ) Have you ever seen a ship like No. No, of course not. This answers something important for Julia.
JACK: No. No, of course not. This answers something important for Julia.
JULIA: I wonder what brought us back?
JACK: .There was a transmission. I don't know who sent it.
JULIA: We'll never really know without the flight recorder. ( almost casually. ) She says we can't go down there, that it's too dangerous. He laughs a little, shakes his head.
JACK: Funnily enough, you've found your Have I? An awkward beat, then:
JULIA: ( SMILING )
JACK: How did you know my name?
JULIA: .You look like someone I once ( extending her hand ) I understand I owe you my life. Thank you, Jack. They shake. A weird moment. She breaks away, looks back at the Tet which now glows a pale orange on the horizon.
JACK: In a few hours, the Tet will come online. Victoria will report your rescue and I imagine they'll send someone down for you.
JULIA: From. the `Pet?
JACK: She gestures out to the Bubbleship on its pad.
JULIA: You fly that thing?
JACK: .You could say that. She SMILES, pleased. A twinkle in her eye.
JULIA: Alright then. Don't you want to EXT. SKY TOWER, BUBBLESHIP PAD - EARLY MORNING JACK and JULIA are suited up, ready to go. The Tetis still low and far on the dark horizon, silhouetted bythe first signs of sunlight growing in the East. The Bubbleship's ENGINES start up with their distinctive whine. As they head towards the ship, Victoria comes out from the house, a robe pulled on.
VICTORIA: Jack! What are you doing?
JACK: I'll bring her back before Tet- Rise. We just want to try to find the flight recorder. You can't know everything watching from a mile up.
VICTORIA: She shouldn't be Julia turns on Victoria, quickly.
JULIA: Thank you. I feel very well. Then, coldly, she boards the ship.
JACK: She's the flight officer, she wants. to see the wreck of her ship and secure items there. You'd want to do the same thing.
VICTORIA: Jack, please.
JACK: Don't worry, we'll be back before you have to make your report.
VICTORIA: That's not it. I can't protect you with the Tet offline and I just have a very bad.
JACK: I'll be fine. He turns and boards. Julia is staring at her through the The bubbleship rises and then falls off to the side, plummeting towards earth.
VICTORIA: Jack. This isn't just about protocol. I'm trying to I'll be home for breakfast. And he SWITCHES OFF the Comm.
JACK: ( BEAT )
JULIA: So I guess I'm around. a hundred years old.
JACK: The Scavs assumed taking out the moon would wipe us out, and it almost did. But we re-grouped, fought back. We beat them in the She glances at him.
JULIA: A dry planet. He nods at the Tet, rising in the distance.
JACK: Yeah. What's left of us are up there now, ready to go where you were headed, Mars. 40 acres and a mule. What we've got left. What you've got. Julia stares out at the Tet.
JULIA: What about you?
JACK: We were born and raised up there. Vika's the A-student. I'm just a tech. I fix things. I.
JULIA: She stares back down at the landscape.
JULIA: No! NO! It's been taken. DAMN
IT!: ( CONTINUED )
JACK: Look, it doesn't matter
JULIA: It matters, okay!? You don't. you can't understand. I need that flight recorder. I need to know what happened.
JACK: We should stay close to. She ignores him, moves on. Deeper in the wreckage, she locates the empty moorings that held the Steel Cylinder Jack saw. It's also gone.
VICTORIA: ( hitting the Comm ) Jack! Jack! There's something coming your way. JACK!!"
JULIA: ( without looking up ) You're staring at me.
JACK: I'm sorry. INTERCUT: Victoria watches as MORE AND MORE Alien figures pass the camera feed. Moving towards Jack and Julia's position. Victoria, HELPLESS. Julia looks up at Jack, directly for the first time. He stares at her.
VICTORIA: JACK! JACK.! EXT. OPEN LAND - DAWN Darkness. LOUD SOUNDS. ANIMAL PANTING. Small, glimpses of earth moving by, then darkness again. Jack and Julia are tied to a huge SCAV SLED pulled by twelve FERAL DOGS. A combination of old scavenged military hardware and new innovation to adapt to a world without engine-power. Giant treads roll forward as the dogs STRAIN against metallic harnesses. Jack's head lolls to the side. He blinks, looks over to see Julia next to him, unconscious. He tracks up. At the top of the sled, a massive Alien Scav pilots the sled, sand whipping through a head-dress we recognize: The LEADER. He holds a long whip, cracks it over the dogs who haul the sled forward. We slow, letting the sled pull away from us into the dark as we travel BACK, towards where we came from, reveal. The Bubbleship's ROVER has been following. A machine meant for small journeys, it rolls inside the tread path left by the sled, but it can barely handle the terrain.

At the top of the sled, a massive Alien Scav pilots the sled, sand whipping through a head-dress we recognize: The LEADER. He holds a long whip, cracks it over the dogs who haul the sled forward. We slow, letting the sled pull away from us into the dark as we travel BACK, towards where we came from, reveal. The Bubbleship's ROVER has been following. A machine meant for small journeys, it rolls inside the tread path left by the sled, but it can barely handle the terrain.
BEECH: MonteCristo, #2. Do you have any idea how long I've waited, for He EXHALES a stream of smoke into the beam, then moves closer, into the light. Beech's face is lined with age and exposure, his skin scarred from battle. His teeth yellowed and crooked, but his arms and body are strong. Jack TENSES. Beech's voice is calm, with a barely held- back malice lurking just under the surface.
JACK: Who are you? Where is this? BEECH inhales again. There's a piercing curiosity to Beech's gaze, studying him.
BEECH: We're deep underground. Very deep We were taken by the Scavs.
JACK: We were taken by the Scavs.
BEECH: Oh. The "Scavs".
JACK: The Scavs took everything from us. And if you're working with them
BEECH: Interesting, Jack. Interesting. You're worried I might be some kind of. Collaborator. Jack doesn't respond.
JACK: No, they're programmed to
BEECH: To what, Jack?
JACK: Anyone would have.
BEECH: Anyone. Would have. Interesting. Julia comes around, her eyes flickering open, She SCREAMS, looking frantically for an escape. Jack GRABS her, protecting her, calming her. Beech gets CLOSE, studies Jack, what he's doing. Nods.
BEECH: We grow what we can, under the lights. It isn't much; Wheat- grass, some vegetables, what beans and soy we can. The general state of our health proves that human beings are not herbivores, but the alternative is not appetizing to Not yet, anyway.
JACK: When we get you up to the Tet, there's plenty -
BEECH: There is? Plenty. Plenty of Look,it'samazing you've lasted thislong.But the radiation zonesare growing. All of this, willbe gone soon.
JACK: ( BEAT )
BEECH: The zones. the area you don't No one does. You go there -
JACK: No one does. You go there -
BEECH: Your organs boil from the inside. I've heard. Beech moves on, turning down another corridor. There are PAINTINGS, stacked against the walls. Picasso, Monet, Kandinsky, Warhol. SCULPTURES in piles.
JULIA: It reminds me of home.
VICTORIA: He's disappeared.
VICTORIA: .Six hours.
VICTORIA: The Scavs took him. I witnessed it. He has a. A beat. Victoria experiencing jealousy she didn't fully understand before.
VICTORIA: I told you, she's with the Technical Officer. I'm requesting permission to re-task the Drones for search and rescue.
VICTORIA: ( FRUSTRATED )
JULIA: Jack, what he said about the ( not looking at her ) It took three decades to build the Tet. And when it was finally ready and it was time to go up, there were people who refused. Leaders, who told their people to Staring at Beech, the glint in the man's eyes.
JACK: ( not looking at her ) It took three decades to build the Tet. And when it was finally ready and it was time to go up, there were people who refused. Leaders, who told their people to Staring at Beech, the glint in the man's eyes.
VICTORIA'S VOICE: Jack! Jack! There's something coming your way. JACK!!!! Victoria LISTENS, chilled. She hits REWIND, then PLAY:
JACK'S VOICE: .It'll be fine. Trust me.
VICTORIA'S VOICE: I'm trying to.
JACK'S VOICE: I'll be home for breakfast. Alone in the Sky Tower, this hits Victoria hard. REWIND. Victoria STARES at the counter, letting it go further back. Then, PLAY. Just STATIC. Then we hear Victoria's end of a conversation we already witnessed:
VICTORIA'S VOICE: What are you doing out there so far, Jack? Then the static for a moment filled with GARBLED SOUNDS. Victoria hits STOP. She stares. Makes an adjustment, plays the SOUNDS again. Something drawing her in.
JULIA: The bomb. She REALIZES something, wheels on Beech, angry.
BEECH: I know what I did. But tell us, Commander, why did you have a bomb on board, what was it for? Tell She looks at Jack, reluctant to say it, but.
JULIA: The Tet. is an alien ship, Jack. The odyssey's mission - Our mission, was to investigate it. Jack shakes his head no. Angry.
BEECH: It attacked us. First it destroyed our moon. Then it unleashed its primary weapon, a brilliant weapon.
JACK: I was born there!
BEECH: I was born in Chicago, Jack. I used to go to baseball games with my father. I used to get two big hot dogs, fill 'em up with relish, and mustard. Just go to town. Me and my pops, watching the sox. ( quick, pressing ) You have any memories like that No, my father was a
JACK: No, my father was a
BEECH: Was what? Tall? Fat? He yell at your mom? Ever go to a baseball game, Jack?
JACK: ( GETTING ANGRY )
BEECH: Right, sorry. Tell me how your mother smelled.
JACK: My mother, smelled like warm fruit. Like oranges, sitting in the sun. Jack starts to speak. Stops. Beech moves to one of the scavenged DELTA SLEEP PODS, runs his hand over the embossed name-plate.
BEECH: My mother, smelled like warm fruit. Like oranges, sitting in the sun. Jack starts to speak. Stops. Beech moves to one of the scavenged DELTA SLEEP PODS, runs his hand over the embossed name-plate.
JULIA: It was you, Jack.
JACK: You and Victoria. We were all on the Odyssey. We were supposed to make contact.
JULIA: You and Victoria. We were all on the Odyssey. We were supposed to make contact.
JACK: The Tet is an alien vessel, Commander Jack Harper. It came and destroyed our moon and most of humanity when it did. And ever since, with your help, it's been trying to finish the job.
BEECH: The Tet is an alien vessel, Commander Jack Harper. It came and destroyed our moon and most of humanity when it did. And ever since, with your help, it's been trying to finish the job.
JACK: You're insane. This is insane. He turns to Julia, but she won't help him.
BEECH: What? People like you? We are the last real people.
SHOULDERS ): But you can, repairman. That is the beautiful irony. It gave you the skills.
SYKES: It followed him here. I told you this was a mistake! Beech, processing. All around the periphery, REACTION. This is a disaster.
BEECH: Well well, we may be out of time. Set the Drone to return to the Tet upon reactivation. It needs to go right to the center
JACK: No! It will kill -
BEECH: ( RAGING )
JACK: No. I won't do it.
SYKES: He won't help us. We bury them both, make our run as soon as we can load up.
JULIA: Jack stares Sykes down.
NO!!: Jack stares Sykes down.
JACK: You know I stare into weapons every day, so you can put that away. Because here's what I can tell you. ( back to Beech ) If the Rover found us, the Drones will too. Unless you want them to find you, let me get somewhere where I can send a signal. Somewhere far from here. Beech. caught.
BEECH: ( IGNORING SYKES )
JACK: The Drones would kill you. Let me try to stop that.
SYKES: You can't trust him!
JACK: ( staying on Beech ) You're wasting time. On Beech, Sykes.
JACK: I can fix this.
BEECH: Well, you're the repairman. Jack powers up the bike and gets on. He looks at Julia who hesitates, then she climbs on the back of the bike.
JACK: I'll get to the antenna, send a signal with my location. The Tet will call off the search. .You should be safe, for now. Jack starts to go.
BEECH: Jack. What if I told you that I had been to your radiation zones. And what I found there. Would change everything you think you know about the world.
SYKES: What makes you think he's any different from the others? Beech stares at him a moment, then back out.
BEECH: She does. Beech turns away.
JULIA: What happened.? She's staring into the distance where an old WRECK of a RESOURCE GATHERER lies shattered against a cliff-face.
JACK: The Scavs brought it down ten years ago. All. this time, I thought we were at war with the Scavs. but it turns out we were just killing each other. He turns, heads off on foot. After a moment, she EXT. CLIFF TOP - DAY Jack and Julia reach the top of a high cliff, with what looks like a METAL SPIRE protruding upwards at its edge.
VICTORIA'S VOICE: ( LAUGHING )
JACK'S VOICE: I don't think they'll have those on Mars, Honey.
VICTORIA'S VOICE: Okay, fine. No dishwasher. How about just you. All the time.
JACK'S VOICE: Yes. When we get there. ON VICTORIA. Her face totally still. Strangely frozen in the face of this sweet little exchange.
JULIA: What will you do now? Jack doesn't answer. He moves to the edge of the deck, stares out, unwilling to meet her eyes.
JACK: That old man is smart. Those fuel cells, the way he's got them tied in with your device. He could blow the whole station.
JULIA: Jack, you can't turn them in. He glances at her, shakes his head.
JACK: What do you want from me? I'm just a repairman.
JULIA: ( CAREFULLY )
JACK: Look, stop, okay? Just
JULIA: But for you, it was always the stars. You wanted to fly further and faster than any one else.
JACK: I don't know who you're talking
ABOUT: I'm talking about a man I knew, who was fearless. A man who wouldn't bow out of a fight, ever.
JULIA: I'm talking about a man I knew, who was fearless. A man who wouldn't bow out of a fight, ever.
JACK: STOP! You and that old man have this story. Except I know who I am, okay? I know who I am!
JULIA: No, you don't. That thing brainwashed you, it erased your
MEMORIES: He turns, starts to lean on the old telescope, draws back, staring at the thing like it bit him.
JACK: Why do I. what is it about this Ten days before we got our go- ahead, you asked me to meet you INTERCUT: VICTORIA. Eager to find out where the Bubbleship is headed, she punches up the live feed. Julia comes close, puts a hand out, rests it on his chest. She moves closer to him, searching his eyes.
JULIA: Ten days before we got our go- ahead, you asked me to meet you INTERCUT: VICTORIA. Eager to find out where the Bubbleship is headed, she punches up the live feed. Julia comes close, puts a hand out, rests it on his chest. She moves closer to him, searching his eyes.
JACK: When I sleep. You're always She kisses him.
YOUNGER JACK: There, right there. Take a look. She smiles, puts her eye to the telescope.
YOUNGER JULIA: Oh, okay. I don't understand. YOUNGER JACK nervously produces an ENGAGEMENT RING from his pocket.
YOUNGER JACK: Now, pan to the right, slowly.
JULIA: There are a few pages missing, but it's the same book.
JACK: Vika, it's me. I'm. all right. I'm coming in. Don't report in to Mission, not until I get back. No response. Dead air. Julia is pressed far back in her seat, watching Jack.
JACK'S VOICE: .I'm 20 minutes out. A TONE makes Victoria look over. The Tet, checking in.
VICTORIA: Go to hell. Beat. Beat.
VICTORIA: ( LIPS TREMBLING )
JACK: Vika. the Scavs. They're humans, like us. The war has become some giant. mistake. She turns. The heartbreak in her face clear.
VICTORIA: I saw you. I saw you two.
JACK: ( shaking her head ) Stay away from me with the truth! I don't want the truth. I preferred oblivion. Victoria looks up, sees Julia in the distance.
SHE'S: ( shaking her head ) Stay away from me with the truth! I don't want the truth. I preferred oblivion. Victoria looks up, sees Julia in the distance.
VICTORIA: ( shaking her head ) Stay away from me with the truth! I don't want the truth. I preferred oblivion. Victoria looks up, sees Julia in the distance.
JACK: ( broken for her ) Vika, she was my wife. She looks at the infinite sky, the clouds, and as the TET appears. He steps towards her and she backs towards the edge.
VICTORIA: I told them. The drones will be here. For her. For you.
JACK: Then come with me. ( she shakes no ) Don't you see what it means? There are still people, living on Earth. Surviving on earth. People like us. Victoria hears that and laughs, bitter.
VICTORIA: Oh, Jack. I think they made us. Victoria steps backwards. Jack LUNGES forward.
JACK: PETALS are falling towards us from the skytower, and then, so is VICTORIA.
NOOO1: PETALS are falling towards us from the skytower, and then, so is VICTORIA.
JACK: This is Technician Jack Harper. The signal goes out. Beat. Beat.
JACK: She's dead.
JACK: Did you hear what I said? She's THE TET ( TEXT ON SCREEN ) Prep the survivor for immediate evac. You will be reassigned.
JACK: I want to talk to somebody. THE TET ( TEXT ON SCREEN ) It'll be good to have you back.
JACK: DAMN YOU! I want to hear your Beat. Beat. Tet Comm Status: "Communication Ended." He stares at this last transmission. Then looks up to the big map. From all over the sector, DRONES are closing on the Sky Tower. Closing on him.
JACK: We have to go.
JULIA: Where are we going?
JACK: Beech said to look in the radiation zones. I have to go And if he's just a crazy old man? Jack looks at her. It'd be a funny moment, but it's not.
JULIA: And if he's just a crazy old man? Jack looks at her. It'd be a funny moment, but it's not.
JACK: I've been wrong about everything He dives the ship towards the clouds below.
JACK: He punches the throttle. The Bubbleship with Drone 166 attached blasts in the direction of A CLIFF FACE. DRONE 166 gets free of one restraint, rotates so its cannon come to bear on part of the undercarriage. OPENS UP, blasting the storage to bits. And Jack PULLS UP, just clearing the ridge, Drone 166 IMPACTING ROCK. The Drone blasts clear through, CRASHES
JACK: You okay?
JULIA: Jack nods, turns the ship north again. The Bubbleship shaking and smoking. Up ahead, the RIDGELINE WARNING ALARMS trigger on the Bubbleship's display What is that?
JACK: Radiation warning. We're five clicks from the border. Jack makes an adjustment, the Bubbleship SURGES with more speed. It sounds like it's going to tear itself apart.
JULIA: I got this. Jack hits it. They're both propelled back into their seats. The radiation zone coming up fast. They CROSS
JACK: I got this. Jack hits it. They're both propelled back into their seats. The radiation zone coming up fast. They CROSS
JACK: Son of a bitch, old man. Words die on his lips as he tracks the plume of smoke from the downed Drone 166, lifting over a nearby ridge. He turns back to the ruined ship, grabs his carbine.
JACK'S VOICE: No! Wait! The Repairman hears the voice, even as he flips the switch. He LEAPS BACK, spinning around, his carbine coming off his back, lined on Jack fifteen feet away who
JULIA'S VOICE: Julia has just crested the rise, sees the two Jack's. Also understanding.
JACK: Julia! Stay back! Jack 2 senses her movement, SPINS and AIMS his rifle as
JULIA: ( HORRIFIED )
JACK: I'll be back for you.
JACK: ( EMPTY WORDS )
VICTORIA 2: You're early.
JACK: .Just a bit of a dust up.
VICTORIA 2: Are you all right? He nods. She comes over to him. He marvels at her beauty, the simplicity of life here.
JACK: I cut myself, I just came by I'll get it.
VICTORIA 2: I'll get it.
JACK: No, I'll get it. He kisses her. Gentle, loving.
VICTORIA 2: We should watch a movie tonight. He sits, looking around himself. He belongs here. He fits here. Victoria munches on something.
VICTORIA 2: Hey, you didn't say goodbye.
JACK: ( BEAT )
JACK: This is gonna pinch a little.
JULIA: ( NOT PROCESSING )
JACK: I always thought that plateau up there could be for a house someday. I thought about remaining here, letting the rest of humanity run off to Mars. And we'd just stay here. Jack stops himself, realizing how easily he said "we."
JULIA: I'm sorry. Jack.
JACK: He moves away from her, lights the fire, it starts to crackle. He gets up and goes, walking down to the lake. She stands near the fire, glad for its warmth, watching him out there, silhouetted in front of the lake. WITH JACK. He stares out over the water. Letting the truth wash over him. And then MUSIC from the grotto. the opening bars to the Temptation's "My Girl."
JULIA: He loved this song. Jack sits, shivering, looking out at the lake. She moves to him, wraps a blanket around him.
JACK: What was he like?
JULIA: He was arrogant, and annoying, and the best man I'd ever known. Some distant part of Jack smiles at that.
JACK: I'm not that man.
JULIA: Shhhhh. Yes you are. She rests her head against on his shoulder, holds him. Simple, caring. His eyes. close.
YOUNGER JACK: We should just tell everybody.
YOUNGER JULIA: No, when we come home. They KISS.
YOUNGER JULIA: He looks over, smiles. She's naked under the sheets, happy, smiling back at him.
JACK: We can't stay here. She smiles, nods.
JACK: Stay here.
BEECH: ( not looking up ) The first ones were soldiers, programmed only to kill. Beech slowly, painfully, looks at him. Little emotion in Beech, just resigned recognition.
JACK: I'm the weapon of this war. BEECH smiles sardonic, nods.
BEECH: The Tet. The clockmaker God. Such brilliant, complex machinery. For such a simple task. To steal our water, our life. all for fuel.
JACK: Why didn't you tell me?
BEECH: Not the kind of news that. ( coughing up blood ) .motivates a man. Beat,then low, defeated.
JACK: The device.?
BEECH: ( shaking his head ) No Drone. It will go on, devouring world, after world.
JULIA'S VOICE: There is a way. Julia stands in the doorway to the library.
JULIA: It wants me. Bring me to it. ( off his silence ) I'm right. You know I am. It's the only way.
JULIA: Is it ready? Julia is standing at the entrance to the room. He nods and she approaches, STARES at what will be her coffin.
JACK: Let's just do it. She moves to climb in, then turns to Jack and kisses him. It's a kiss filled with a lifetime of kisses missed. Finally, it breaks. She backs away, into the Pod, next to the BOMB. Trembling as the door starts to CLOSE. Suddenly, she's very scared. Fighting back panic.
JULIA: Let's just do it. She moves to climb in, then turns to Jack and kisses him. It's a kiss filled with a lifetime of kisses missed. Finally, it breaks. She backs away, into the Pod, next to the BOMB. Trembling as the door starts to CLOSE. Suddenly, she's very scared. Fighting back panic.
JACK: Dream about us.
ORIGINAL JACK: ( to Mission Control ) So far, from this distance, we're still reading zero heat signatures, no sign of organic life. Did I mention we're still really far away?
ORIGINAL VICTORIA: Mission plan has us approaching to one hundred kilometers, doing our initial readouts.
ORIGINAL JACK: Yes, because everyone knows, if you want to really know something, one hundred kilometers is the best
DISTANCE: ORIGINAL VICTORIA
ORIGINAL VICTORIA: Stop. We don't know what it is, if it has intentions.
ORIGINAL JACK: ( to Mission Control ) I think she just made my point
JACK: Bob, let's prep for outer OUTSIDE, the Bubbleship starts to transform for outer space as it RISES higher and higher.
THE TET: ( a metallic voice ) Technician Harper.
JACK: Finally. There you are.
THE TET: Your ship has converted to space mode. This is not authorized.
JACK: I am delivering the survivor from the crash of the NASA ship. ON JACK. The Tet reflected in his eyes.
THE TET: Jack. exhales. The TINY BUBBLESHIP climbs towards the massive artificial moon as the audio from the flight recorder surrounds him again.
ORIGINAL VICTORIA: It could be inert. Anything on it could be long gone by now.
ORIGINAL JACK: Which is why we need to make contact, before it just blows on by like some.
ORIGINAL VICTORIA: Which is why we need to make He double-takes, relieved that she finally agrees with him, smiles.
ORIGINAL VICTORIA: Mission control says maintain one thousand meters. Original Jack touches a control. The Shuttle pushes forward, a little.
ORIGINAL JACK: This is a once in a lifetime We have our orders, Jack. We're to let it proceed without
ORIGINAL VICTORIA: We have our orders, Jack. We're to let it proceed without
ORIGINAL JACK: We are. We're going to let it proceed whereever it's going. He lifts out of his seat, floats back towards the mid- section of the Shuttle.
ORIGINAL VICTORIA: ( CONTINUED )
ORIGINAL JACK: I'll be right back.
ORIGINAL, VICTORIA: Are we really going to do this? He looks over. original Victoria is already pulling on her spacesuit. A last glance back at Julia, then he turns away. He smiles at Victoria, drifts next to her, pulling out a small camera and pointing it back at the two of them.
JACK: Let's make history. FLASH. The birth of the picture of the two of them, eyes filled with anticipation. The photo in Jack's locker.
JACK: It's okay Bob, I'm scared too. In front of him, a SLOT opens in the Tet wall.
THE TET: Enter at headway speed only.
JACK: Entering at headway speed. He flies into the Tet, carrying the POD.
THE TET: Leave the survivor and return to your duties. Breathable atmosphere has been provided. A PAD is illuminated for Jack to land.
JACK: ( SMALL SMILE )
THE TET: Leave the survivor and return to your duties.
JACK: ( touching a control ) You know, you made a mistake, Tet. You left me curious.
THE TET: Reverse course. Leave the
JACK: And right now, I want to see what you're made of. Jack GUNS his ship at the large doors, OPENING UP with canons as he does. In front of him, the door IMPLODES just as Jack's ship reaches it, passing into.
JACK: Do you like books, Tet!? I like books. Can I tell you something that I read? BEHIND THE BUBBLESHIP. DRONES detach from the walls of the Tet, beginning pursuit.
JACK: There was a guy named Horatius. and he held a bridge, alone. And when they told him to run, to give up, he said BOOM! A drone blast EXPLODES A whole engine of the ship. The Bubbleship goes into an uncontrollable SPIN, headed straight at a WALL.
JACK: .What Horatius said, what his argument was, was this. He opens the pod, revealing. BEECH'S BODY, and on his chest the raw BOMB. The nuclear warhead from the odyssey surrounded by ten Deuterium fuel cells.
THE TET: That is not the Survivor.
JACK: BEHIND HIM. The Drones blast away the last bit of the Bubbleship, push through.
JACK: How can a man die.
JULIA: ( CONTINUED )
JACK: How can man die better Than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, And the temples of his gods. The DRONES are on him, weapons lining!
DRONE 166: falls inert in front of Julia as the Tet Explodes in the sky above her. She stares up, tears already running down her face.
BLACK: FADE UP ON: EXT. A GARDEN - DAY Well-tended. Thick ripe fruit hang on vines.
JULIA: Well, almost everyone. A MAN stands at the edge of the water, on the opposite side. He wears the wrecked remains of a worksuit, and carries a pack. It is Jack 2. He's aged three years, his hair has grown, his boots are scavenged. He has travelled a long way, and we know that as he stares across the water, he knows exactly what he is looking at.
CHILD: Who is that? ON JULIA. It's been a long journey to this moment for her as well. She smiles.
JULIA: It's your father. Come on, let's go pick him up.
