SECOND VOICE: ( through bullhorn ) Why don't we blast 'im, for Christ sake, he ain't gonna come down. The BULLHORN is TURNED OFF. A long moment passes as McMurphy continues to squat on the tower and wait. He shivers against the coming night when.
MILLER: Where you goin', Chief?
WARREN: You goin' t'see the Big White He goin' t'see the Big White They cackle, legs jiving, as the ammonia stings Bromden's eyes and burns his nose. He tries to twist his head, but Washington jams the mop harder. Bromden freezes, panic spreading across his face.
WASHINGTON: He goin' t'see the Big White They cackle, legs jiving, as the ammonia stings Bromden's eyes and burns his nose. He tries to twist his head, but Washington jams the mop harder. Bromden freezes, panic spreading across his face.
THREE ATTENDANTS: ( simultaneously, as Big Nurse passes ) Mornin', Miss Ratched.
BIG NURSE: Good morning, boys. She sweeps by and disappears into the nurses' station. The three attendants put their mops and rags aside and start towards the men's dorm, leaving Bromden pressed against the wall, mop in hand.
MISS PILBOW: Good morning, Miss Ratched. It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
BIG NURSE: Mean old Monday, Miss Pilbow, mean old Monday. Good morning, boys. Rise and shine. Rise and shine.
BIG NURSE: Good morning, Mister Sefelt. Good morning, Mister Fredrickson. Good morning, Billy, I spoke to your mother last night and she sends her love. Good morning, Mister Harding. Good morning, Mister Cheswick. Mister Scanlon. Bromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction. Big Nurse takes his hand and reaches up and pats his face.
WASHINGTON: Yes, Miss Ratched?
BIG NURSE: Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
WASHINGTON: ( taking Bromden by the hand ) Yes, Miss Ratched.
WASHINGTON: ( calling as he goes ) He sits Bromden down and straps his bands and legs in, then plugs the electric shaver in and turns it on and brings the BUZZING instrument towards Bromden's face. Bromden turns ( shouting out ) Get your black ass in here! Warren props the vegetable up against the sink.
WARREN: Tha's it. be right back! Warren leaves; the old man starts sliding.
BROMDEN: as Warren enters and takes a firm grip on Bromden's head and Washington goes to work on Bromden's face. CAMERA PUSHES INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully distorted face as the BUZZING SOUND of the electric razor INTENSIFIES until it is
MISS PILBOW: Eighty-two, Miss Pilbow speaking. . New admission, Miss Ratched. Miss Pilbow goes to the mirror, quickly preens herself, then turns and flips the intercom on.
DEPUTY SHERIFF: ( to an unseen occupant ) Okay, let's go. A long beat, then McMurphy slowly emerges from the car. He's wearing handcuffs and dressed in faded jeans, flannel work shirt, leather jacket, black motorcycle cap, and heavy black boots. He's been scrubbed clean and has a Band-Aid on his cheek. McMurphy does a couple of knee bends to get the kinks out of his legs as Deputy reaches in the car and takes out a small gym bag containing McMurphy's belongings.
SECOND DEPUTY: Okay, this is it! McMurphy turns and holds out his hands. As cuffs are removed, McMurphy impulsively takes hold of the Deputy's head and plants a kiss on his forehead.
MCMURPHY: Yeah, ain't that the truth.
DEPUTY SHERIFF: ( to Miss Pilbow ) He's all yours, Miss.
MISS PILBOW: Thank you, Officer. The two Deputies start down the stairs.
MCMURPHY: So long, fellas. The two Deputies merely shrug their backs at McMurphy who takes a deep breath of fresh air.
MISS PILBOW: This way, Mister McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: Yes, ma'am. McMurphy follows Nurse Pilbow into the hallway as the door closes behind them.
MCMURPHY: ( as he peels the Band-Aid off, revealing a scar ) I tell ya, these goons showered me at the courthouse this morning, last night at the jail, and I swear they'd have swabbed my ears out on the way over if they could've found the facilities. A young Japanese nurse, named ITSU, passes by.
NURSE ITSU: Okay. How you doing?
MCMURPHY: Just great! See ya around! Nurse Itsu laughs and disappears around the corner.
MISS PILBOW: I'm sure you will.
MCMURPHY: ( to Nurse Pilbow ) Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
MISS PILBOW: They arrive at the ward door. Nurse Pilbow unlocks the door and opens it as.
MCMURPHY: Yeah, I'm here on a ninety-day observation period. Short-timer, like they say. Soft nostalgic MUSIC is HEARD OVER.
MISS PILBOW: Of course. Mister McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: After you, ma'am.
MISS PILBOW: Thank you. Nurse Pilbow enters the ward and McMurphy watches her cross the visitors' area to a heavy-gauge steel screen wall, with security gate which she opens.
MCMURPHY: ( to Washington and Warren as they step into ward ) Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
SPIVEY: ( calling ) Hold it! McMurphy turns to see DOCTOR SPIVEY approaching.
SPIVEY: Great day for fishing.
SPIVEY: ( to McMurphy ) Oh, what's that?
MCMURPHY: Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
SPIVEY: Oh, do you do much fishing? As they pass through the security gate:
MCMURPHY: Fish! Hell, Doc, I'd like to have a nickel for every fish I landed between Point Conception and the Alaska coast. Washington and Warren continue down the hallway, passing SEFELT, who shyly approaches and waits at a respectful Is that so?
SPIVEY: ( to McMurphy ) Is that so?
MCMURPHY: Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
SPIVEY: My, my. Ah, who are you?
MCMURPHY: McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy. They shake hands.
NURSE PILBOW: Mister McMurphy is a new admission.
SPIVEY: Ah, yes. Well, we must talk soon, Mister McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: You bet, Doc. Spivey turns to Sefelt.
SPIVEY: Good morning, Jim. How are you Doc, my gungs hurt me. Spivey starts checking out Sefelt's mouth.
SEFELT: ( approaching and pointing to his mouth ) Doc, my gungs hurt me. Spivey starts checking out Sefelt's mouth.
NURSE PILBOW: This way, Mister McMurphy. As McMurphy follows Nurse Pilbow down the hall, Spivey's voice trails after him.
MISS PILBOW: Make yourself at home, Mister Thank you, ma'am, Nurse Pilbow enters the nurses' station, closing the door behind her. Next to the door is a bulletin board which, among other bits of information, READS:
MCMURPHY: Thank you, ma'am, Nurse Pilbow enters the nurses' station, closing the door behind her. Next to the door is a bulletin board which, among other bits of information, READS:
SEFELT: Sefelt crosses into the day room where he joins Fredrickson, who is putting a jigsaw puzzle together.
ANOTHER ANGLE: McMurphy smiles and tips his hat to Big Nurse. Big Nurse smiles back and takes her seat. McMurphy turns and drifts into the day room. Big Nurse looks up and studies him. McMurphy catches the eye of a PATIENT, sitting by himself.
MCMURPHY: How ya doin', buddy?
PATIENT: Poorly, thank you.
MCMURPHY: Oh, yeah? What's ailing ya?
PATIENT: I got the fever.
MCMURPHY: Well, that's too bad. Taber, pencil and paper in hand, crosses to McMurphy and taps him on the shoulder.
TABER: Are you a doctor?
MCMURPHY: No, 'fraid not. Taber walks away. Martini tugs at McMurphy's sleeve.
MARTINI: Can you borrow me a dime?
MCMURPHY: Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta Scanlon moves in.
SCANLON: Got a cigarette?
MCMURPHY: Me too! Me too! As McMurphy hands out his cigarettes Bromden drifts by, mop in hand.
MARTINI: Me too! Me too! As McMurphy hands out his cigarettes Bromden drifts by, mop in hand.
MCMURPHY: Hey, how's it look up there, big He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
SCANLON: He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
MCMURPHY: That right?
MCMURPHY: ( to Martini ) Your buddy is callin' ya. Martini crosses back to the card game as Taber returns.
MCMURPHY: What's troubling ya, buddy?
TABER: I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
MCMURPHY: You look pretty healthy to me.
MCMURPHY: How do ya know that?
MCMURPHY: You're breathin' right now. Taber walks away. McMurphy watches him go. Nearby, an OLD VEGETABLE squeaks.
MCMURPHY: ( crossing to him ) What's that, Pop? The old man squeaks again.
MCMURPHY: ( leaning in close ) Can't hear ya, old-timer.
OLD VEGETABLE: Ain't this a pisser?
MCMURPHY: Hell, compared to where I just come from, this is a country club. McMurphy crosses to the card game and stands watching the Whatcha boys playin'?
MCMURPHY: Whatcha boys playin'?
BILLY: Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand. Billy holds his hand close to his chest.
MCMURPHY: Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand. Billy holds his hand close to his chest.
MCMURPHY: What's your name, buddy?
BILLY: Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy. They shake hands.
MCMURPHY: Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy. They shake hands.
MCMURPHY: What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
MCMURPHY: Yeah, that'll do for openers!
HARDING: Does he have an appointment?
CHESWICK: Yeah, do you have an appointment?
MCMURPHY: What for?
CHESWICK: ( to Harding ) What for?
HARDING: I'm a busy man!
CHESWICK: ( to McMurphy ) He's a busy man! A beat; then:
MCMURPHY: I can wait. McMurphy picks up a chair and sits down right next to Harding and looks at him. Another beat; then:
HARDING: ( to McMurphy ) What are you doing?
MCMURPHY: I'm seeing what a busy man does. Harding, very nervous at McMurphy's proximity, turns back to the game.
HARDING: Your turn, Martini! Martini is lost in the clouds.
CHESWICK: Yeah, throw a club! Martini throws a spade.
HARDING: Don't you have any clubs?
MARTINI: Let me see your hand!
HARDING: Let me see your hand!
MARTINI: ( slamming his cards ) Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to. Harding gets up and crosses to the hallway, gathering his pride as he goes. McMurphy slides into Harding's seat and rakes all the cards Yessir, that's why I came to this establishment for, to bring you birds fun and entertainment 'round the gamin' table. McMurphy fans the deck out and lays it on the table. Everyone's eyes pop as he scoops the cards up in one movement he's a card shark, a magician leaving the Acutes with their mouths hanging open.

Everyone's eyes pop as he scoops the cards up in one movement he's a card shark, a magician leaving the Acutes with their mouths hanging open.
MCMURPHY: Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us.
MCMURPHY: Yes, ma'am.
MCMURPHY: ( rising ) Hold the fort down, will ya, Sure, Mack! McMurphy walks with her toward the men's dorm.
BILLY: Sure, Mack! McMurphy walks with her toward the men's dorm.
BIG NURSE: My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
MCMURPHY: Yes, ma'am. Big Nurse and McMurphy stop at the security gate to the men's dorm where Miller opens the gate.
BIG NURSE: We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
MCMURPHY: Thank you, ma'am. Big Nurse stops at an empty bed where Warren is turning the mattress down.
BIG NURSE: This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
MCMURPHY: Yes, ma'am.
BIG NURSE: Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
MCMURPHY: Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
BIG NURSE: All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
MCMURPHY: Yes, ma'am.
BIG NURSE: Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented. McMurphy doesn't move.
MCMURPHY: Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
BIG NURSE: Good. I'm sure we'll be friends. They smile, sizing up each other.
MCMURPHY: Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
BIG NURSE: Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
MCMURPHY: Yes, ma'am. Lead the way, Sam. They cross out of the men's dorm. Big Nurse watches them go.
MCMURPHY: Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
SPIVEY: Oh, what was that?
MCMURPHY: I see.
SPIVEY: I see.
MCMURPHY: Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
MCMURPHY: They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
SPIVEY: I see.
MCMURPHY: To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure.
SPIVEY: Yes. Ah, do you know why you're Well, ya know, Doc. Doesn't it say so there?
MCMURPHY: Well, ya know, Doc. Doesn't it say so there?
SPIVEY: ( looking over papers ) Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.' ( looking up at McMurphy ) What do you think of that report?
MCMURPHY: I don't, Doc.
SPIVEY: ( goes back to papers ) Arrested on an assault charge five That's correct, Doc .
MCMURPHY: That's correct, Doc .
SPIVEY: ( reading from folder ) The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm.' What do you say to that?
MCMURPHY: Doc, what can I tell ya?
SPIVEY: Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
MCMURPHY: No, this is my first trip, Doc.
SPIVEY: ( closes folder and sits back ) Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your You bet, Doc!
MCMURPHY: You bet, Doc!
SPIVEY: Good. Good.
BANCINI: I'm tired. Whew. O Lord. Oh, I'm awful tired.
BIG NURSE: ( busy with her papers ) Somebody please see to Mister Bancini, so we can start the Billy does. gently laying a hand on Bancini.
BILLY: T-t-t-take it e-e-easy, P-P-P Awful tired. Billy gently eases Bancini into his chair and sits beside him, patting his skinny knee.
BANCINI: Awful tired. Billy gently eases Bancini into his chair and sits beside him, patting his skinny knee.
BIG NURSE: At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife. Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
HARDING: Yes, that's perfectly correct.
BIG NURSE: ( reading ) He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.' ( she closes book ) So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further? Big Nurse waits. A long beat. Harding sits, chewing his nails, tensely waiting, almost wanting someone to begin. The patients shift uncomfortably, looking in all directions. McMurphy looks around to see what will follow, when he sees Ellis, nailed to the wall; his pants leg darkens and a puddle of piss forms at his feet. McMurphy looks to see if Big Nurse or the Aides have noticed. If they have, no one pays any attention. McMurphy fidgets in his seat, then gets up, crosses to Ellis, unhooks him from the wall, and moves him over a few feet. The other patients are aghast at this move, look at each other quizzically. Big Nurse merely watches. McMurphy crosses back to his chair and sits.
MCMURPHY: Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water.
BIG NURSE: Yes. We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start? Would you like to start?
BILLY: BIG NURSE Would you like to start?
BIG NURSE: Would you like to start?
BILLY: N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
BIG NURSE: Mister Sefelt? Sefelt shrugs and sinks into his seat.
MARTINI: BIG NURSE Mister Scanlon? Scanlon looks at the floor.
BIG NURSE: Mister Scanlon? Scanlon looks at the floor.
HARDING: Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
BIG NURSE: But you have no proof.
HARDING: No, Miss Ratched.
BIG NURSE: And yet you suspect her.
HARDING: Yes, that is correct.
BIG NURSE: I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
HARDING: I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
BIG NURSE: Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements? One of the Chronics laughs like a child.
HARDING: Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
SEFELT: What's he talkin' about?
TABER: Yeah, Harding, why don't you knockoff the bullshit and get to the point. Several Acutes chime in, "Yeah, get to the point," AD LIB.
HARDING: The point is, I will carry on until I fully understand what the function of that relationship is regardless of form or content. Several hands go up.
BIG NURSE: Yes, Billy?
BILLY: I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
TABER: Yeah, Harding, you're so fuckin' dumb I can't believe it.
HARDING: That's a matter of opinion.
SEFELT: Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe Through the ass. Sefelt and Fredrickson snicker into their hands. A few of the others laugh.
FREDRICKSON: Through the ass. Sefelt and Fredrickson snicker into their hands. A few of the others laugh.
HARDING: ( smarting ) Is that your sense of humor or are you trying to say something?
FREDRICKSON: ( innocence itself ) Now what would I be trying to say?
HARDING: I don't know. I don't know, but it makes me feel very peculiar when you throw in something like that.
FREDRICKSON: Yeah, why?
SEFELT: Yeah, why?
TABER: Yeah, why?
SCANLON: Yeah, tell us why.
HARDING: I hesitate to go on.
BIG NURSE: No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open.
HARDING: I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something.
TABER: You know what, Harding? I think you're some kind of morbid asshole or something. You've been talking about your wife evere since I can remember. You know, she's on your mind and blah, blah, blah and on and on and when are you going to wise up and turn her loose!
FREDRICKSON: Yeah, wise up, Harding.
SEFELT: Yeah, turn her loose!
ACUTES: ( start pouring it on ) Yeah, who do you think you are anyway?. He thinks he's God Almighty. He's a snob. He's a schmuck. Dumbbell. Creep. Cretin. Idiot. Get rid of him. Ship him upstairs.
RUCKLY: ( chiming in ) Ffffffuck da wife.
BANCINI: ( wagging his head ) Tired. Awful tired.
ACUTES: ( not letting up ) Zap him. Give 'im lobotomy. Cut his nuts off. He doesn't have any. Fag. Pervert.
BANCINI: ( in a strong angry voice ) I'm tired! Everyone hushes.
BIG NURSE: Somebody see to Mister Bancini. Two or three Acutes get up and try to soothe Bancini, but he isn't to be hushed.
BANCINI: Tired. Tired. Oh God, I'm tired. Big Nurse nods to Washington, who goes to Pete, and gives his arm a jerk toward the door. Bancini is unmovable. Big Nurse signals Nurse Pilbow, who heads for the nurses' Washington senses danger, lets go of Pete's arm, backs away.
WASHINGTON: You a good boy, Mistah Bancini. Nurse Pilbow returns, hypodermic needle in hand. Pete turns to his fellow inmates.
BANCINI: You see. it's a lotta baloney. It's all a lotta baloney.
NURSE PILBOW: Yes, yes, Mister Bancini, now if you'll just be calm.
BANCINI: That's all it is, just a lotta baloney. Ya see, I can't help it, Yes, I know, I know. She gets him in the ass, with the needle, and springs back.
NURSE PILBOW: ( working her way around Bancini ) Yes, I know, I know. She gets him in the ass, with the needle, and springs back.
BANCINI: . don't ya see. I was born dead. Not you. You wasn't born dead. Ahhh, it's been so hard. Tired. I'm tired. aw-ful McMurphy looks around at the others. Each patient is locked in his own world oblivious to Bancini's state.
MARTINI: ( as he throws ball ) Catch it! Catch it! The ball rolls to the corner.
WASHINGTON: Martini, there ain't nobody there, ya dumb goon! Go get the ball!
MARTINI: Martini turns away, his feelings hurt. Washington goes after the ball, when Martini goes running after it.
MCMURPHY: Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
HARDING: A pecking party?
MCMURPHY: That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
MCMURPHY: Ah, come off it! It's that Big Nurse, that's who. The other Acutes have gathered around McMurphy and Harding.
HARDING: It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to Did to me?
MCMURPHY: I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to Did to me?
HARDING: Did to me?
MCMURPHY: Did to you and all the rest of you Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
BILLY: Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
MCMURPHY: What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
FREDRICKSON: It's the questions she asks.
MCMURPHY: Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
HARDING: Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our She ain't peckin' at your eyes, McMurphy grabs Harding by his balls and Harding goes up on his toes.
MCMURPHY: ( as calm as blue waters ) She ain't peckin' at your eyes, McMurphy grabs Harding by his balls and Harding goes up on his toes.
MCMURPHY: She's peckin' at your balls, buddy, at your ever-lovin' balls. Harding is doubled over.
SEFELT: That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
MCMURPHY: P.A. What the hell is that?
SEFELT: Potential assaultive.
FREDRICKSON: Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
MCMURPHY: Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
HARDING: Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
MCMURPHY: Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
MCMURPHY: What for?
MCMURPHY: HARDING ( CONT'D ) ( pointing to lobotomy case ) McMurphy looks.
MCMURPHY: ( to Harding ) Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
HARDING: Now, what would I be trying to say? Martini and Scanlon rush over and try to get the ball.
SCANLON: Gimme the ball!
MARTINI: No. Me! Me!
MCMURPHY: ( turning to Martini ) Pass it to me, Martini. Martini holds back.
MCMURPHY: C'mon, I'll give it back! Martini passes to McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: Atta boy, Martini. He passes it back to Martini, who laughs and passes it back to McMurphy, who passes it to Scanlon, who passes to McMurphy, who passes to Billy, etc. Bromden just stands Back and forth, that's it. Shoot, man, we'll be takin' on the New York Knicks before we're through. McMurphy looks to see Big Nurse looking out a window at them. He catches her eye. She turns away.
MCMURPHY: ( encouraging them ) Back and forth, that's it. Shoot, man, we'll be takin' on the New York Knicks before we're through. McMurphy looks to see Big Nurse looking out a window at them. He catches her eye. She turns away.
SEFELT: Hit me!
MCMURPHY: Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
SEFELT: McMurphy rakes in Sefelt's cigarettes, adding them to a pile of loose cigarettes, packs of cigarettes, several cartons of As Cheswick sits down, depressed:
MCMURPHY: 'Kay, place your bets.
MARTINI: ( holding up a cigarette ) What's this?
MCMURPHY: That's a dime, Martini. Martini breaks a cigarette in half.
MCMURPHY: ( to Cheswick ) Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
CHESWICK: She won't give me any more That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
MCMURPHY: That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
MCMURPHY: ( checking the board ) 'Kay, all bets are down, let's wheel 'em an' deal 'em. He deals the cards out, the first one face down, then the next one face up.
MCMURPHY: Big king. little deuce. another king. a lovely lady. big ten. and a trey. hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
MARTINI: Hit me.
MCMURPHY: ( hits with a picture ) That's twenty up, Martini. ( turning to TV, he shouts across room ) Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game? Taber calls back something but it's lost in the other sounds.
MCMURPHY: Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing. Koufax against Ford!
TABER: ( shouting back ) Koufax against Ford!
MARTINI: ( simultaneously with Pilbow ) Hit me! McMurphy slams his cards down, stands up, crosses the day room, heading for the nurses' station. He passes Washington, who stands there waiting to dispense orange juice.
MCMURPHY: Pardon me miss, but would you mind Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the. Oh, stay back!
NURSE PILBOW: ( scared out of her wits ) Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the. Oh, stay back!
MCMURPHY: All I'm askin' is. Nurse Pilbow grabs at her cross, screams and shuts her eyes, holding the cross in front of her.
BIG NURSE: Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
MCMURPHY: Sorry, ma'am. McMurphy steps out of the station, closing the door behind INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT as McMurphy goes around to the front of the nurses' station and queues up behind the other Acutes who are getting their medication. McMurphy reaches the window, takes the cup, but doesn't take his pills.
MCMURPHY: ( to Big Nurse ) Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you ( politely ) Yes, Mister McMurphy?
BIG NURSE: ( politely ) Yes, Mister McMurphy?
MCMURPHY: How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
BIG NURSE: ( pleasantly ) That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy leans in, placing his hand on the window.
MCMURPHY: ( confidentially ) Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
MCMURPHY: Sorry, ma'am. Sorry 'bout that. McMurphy breathes on the glass and wipes it clean with his Sorry to have bothered you.
MCMURPHY: Sorry to have bothered you.
BIG NURSE: Not at all, Mister McMurphy. McMurphy turns to walk away.
NURSE PILBOW: Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: ( turning back, he examines the contents of the cup ) What's the horse pill for, honey?
NURSE PILBOW: It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy.
NURSE PILBOW: ( stepping back a little ) Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus.
BIG NURSE: That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it McMurphy makes a big show of popping the pill in his mouth, holding his paper cup upside down, for all to see, then moving on to Washington, who fills it with orange juice. McMurphy gulps it down, not without some difficulty, then he smiles at all the concerned faces and crosses the room to the card table, where he sits to see the Acutes looking at him.
MCMURPHY: No, that's okay, ma'am.

HARDING: Why didn't you tell her to go to hell, lover boy?
TABER: Yeah, whattsa matter, Mack, she too much for ya? McMurphy holds the pill up and flicks it into Harding's You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
MCMURPHY: You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
HARDING: I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
MCMURPHY: Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
PATIENTS' POV: Big Nurse is busy at her work.
REVERSE ANGLE: CAMERA HOLDS on Big Nurse as McMurphy's VOICE is HEARD over
TURKLE: Le's get back to bed, Mistah Bromden allows himself to be led back to bed. Turkle fumbles around for the security belt, finds it, straps Bromden loosely in bed, then goes off clucking to himself. Bromden reaches under his bed and plucks a stale piece of gum from under the bed frame. He starts chewing it when he sees McMurphy looking at him. Bromden goes right on chewing and looking McMurphy right in the eye.
MCMURPHY: ( whispering ) Chief? I wanna ask ya somethin'. ( sings ) Oh, does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? When you chew it in the morning, will it be too hard to bite? This question's got me goin', won't somebody set me right; does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? McMurphy holds the last note, reaches over and rustles through his nightstand.
MCMURPHY: Here ya go, Chief. A small object lands on Bromden's bed. It is a fresh package of gum. Bromden picks it up. Examines it. Unwraps it. Deposits his old piece of gum under the bed frame, then inserts the fresh gum in his mouth and starts chewing.
WASHINGTON: Le's go, Chief. Le's go get ourselves all nice and clean. You too, Mistah Mack-Murphy! Washington goes off with Bromden. CAMERA HOLDS on McMurphy as he slowly pulls it together and sits on the edge of the bed. He's naked as he opens the drawer to his nightstand and fishes around for a cigarette.
MCMURPHY: ( looking in the drawer ) What the. ( looking around ) Who the fuck stole my cigarettes!
BIG NURSE: Good morning, Mister Sefelt, are your teeth any better?. Good morning, Mister Fredrickson. Good morning, Mister Harding; my, my, you've been biting your fingernails again. She sees McMurphy approaching, wearing a towel around his waist and a scowl on his face.
MCMURPHY: I wanna report a robbery!
BIG NURSE: On this ward?
MCMURPHY: Yeah, some creep stole my Oh, I had them removed.
BIG NURSE: Oh, I had them removed.
MCMURPHY: What for?
BIG NURSE: Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day. Bromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction. Big Nurse takes his hand.
WASHINGTON: Yes, Miss Ratched?
BIG NURSE: Please see to Mister Bromden.
WASHINGTON: ( taking Bromden by the hand ) Yes, Miss Ratched. Washington leads Bromden off. Big Nurse turns to Cheswick and several other Acutes, who have crowded around.
BIG NURSE: Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast. You too, Mister McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
BIG NURSE: After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
MCMURPHY: You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
BIG NURSE: Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
WIDER ANGLE: A beat, as the Acutes wait for McMurphy's next move, then:
MCMURPHY: 'Kay, let's go brush our teeth, McMurphy turns and crosses toward the washroom, singing at the top of his lungs.
MCMURPHY: Oh, Lulu had a baby, His name was Sunny Jim, She put 'im in a piss pot, To teach 'im how to swim. Oh, he swam to the bottom, He swam to the top, Lulu got excited, An' pulled 'im by his. Cock-tail ginger-ale, Five cents a glass, An' if ya don't like it Ya can shove it up your. Ask me no more questions, I'll tell ya no more lies.
BIG NURSE: watching McMurphy who removes his towel as he enters the INT. WASHROOM - DAY as McMurphy enters to see Warren take a firm grip on Bromaen's head and Washington goes to work on Bromden's face. CAMERA PUSHES INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully distorted face as the BUZZING SOUND of the ELECTRIC RAZOR INTENSIFIES until it is INSUPPORTABLE.
MCMURPHY: Why, if I'd have known how soft this place was gonna be, I'd have arranged for my transfer sooner. Look at this here, real orange Hooee, that's good. Why, you couldn't pay me to leave this All this place lacks is a couple of sweet gals to liven things up. He gets up and carries his tray to the proper place, where he notices Miller loading several other trays onto a dumbwaiter. Miller pushes a button and the dumbwaiter goes down. McMurphy crosses to the door to find it blocked by Washington.
MCMURPHY: Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
WASHINGTON: Nobody leaves here till seven McMurphy turns Washington over in his mind, then he looks up at the clock above the door. The time is 7:28. The second hand sweeping its way toward
MCMURPHY: Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
MCMURPHY: ( confidentially ) Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
MCMURPHY: ( turning away ) McMurphy turns and walks away. Washington watches him go.
BIG NURSE: Sit down, Mister Cheswick.
CHESWTCK: ( not sitting ) No, I ain't no kid to have my cigarettes keep from me like cookies! Ain't that right, Mack! ( McMurphy doesn't respond ) Sit down, Mister Cheswick! Cheswick sits stunned. A beat; then:
BIG NURSE: Sit down, Mister Cheswick! Cheswick sits stunned. A beat; then:
CHESWICK: BIG NURSE ( opens her book ) Now, as I recall, we were making quite a bit of headway, last time, with Mister Harding's problem. So, does anyone care to begin? McMurphy's hand goes up. No one else's does.
BIG NURSE: ( opens her book ) Now, as I recall, we were making quite a bit of headway, last time, with Mister Harding's problem. So, does anyone care to begin? McMurphy's hand goes up. No one else's does.
MCMURPHY: Right. I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
BIG NURSE: Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: McMurphy takes a folded sheet of paper out of his pocket, unfolds it, studies it and begins.
MCMURPHY: 'Kay. Item one. I've been thinkin' 'bout the age problem we got on this ward. You know, the young an' old livin' together, an' I was thinkin' what a great thing it would be if the music was turned up louder. Louder so the old fellas could hear better. Doctor Spivey nods with approval. Big Nurse doesn't. The Acutes are bewildered.
MCMURPHY: But then I got to thinkin', the music is so loud already, it makes it difficult for the young fellas to hold a decent conversation. Nods and murmurs of approval from the Acutes. Big Nurse can only wait for McMurphy's next move.
MCMURPHY: Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
SPIVEY: It is worth considering. Miss The point is well taken, Doctor, but do we have the necessary personnel to cover a second day Well, since it will be largely the Chronics who remain here, one aide and one nurse should easily be able to handle any situation that might What do you think, men, is it Right, Doc. It's workable. Several other Acutes voice in the affirmative.
BIG NURSE: The point is well taken, Doctor, but do we have the necessary personnel to cover a second day Well, since it will be largely the Chronics who remain here, one aide and one nurse should easily be able to handle any situation that might What do you think, men, is it Right, Doc. It's workable. Several other Acutes voice in the affirmative.
SPIVEY: Well, since it will be largely the Chronics who remain here, one aide and one nurse should easily be able to handle any situation that might What do you think, men, is it Right, Doc. It's workable. Several other Acutes voice in the affirmative.
CHESWICK: Right, Doc. It's workable. Several other Acutes voice in the affirmative.
SPIVEY: BIG NURSE Good. Good. Yes, yes, I think we should give it a trial period. So! May we get back to Mister Harding's ( she sees McMurphy's hand up ) Yes, Mister McMurphy?
BIG NURSE: Good. Good. Yes, yes, I think we should give it a trial period. So! May we get back to Mister Harding's Yes, Mister McMurphy?
MCMURPHY: I'm not finished yet.
BIG NURSE: Go on.
MCMURPHY: ( looking at his list ) 'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
BIG NURSE: Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
MCMURPHY: BIG NURSE Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
BIG NURSE: Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
MCMURPHY: The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
CHESWICK: I second the motion!
MCMURPHY: Atta boy, Cheswick!
BIG NURSE: Very well! All those in favor, please raise your hands. Big Nurse casts a watchful eye over the patients.
MCMURPHY: ( raising his hand ) Okay, raise your hands. Only Cheswick's goes up.
MCMURPHY: Come on', what is this crap? Who wants to watch the World Series? Martini and Scanlon's hands go up. Several Acutes look at them. Scanlon and Martini's hands go down. McMurphy can't believe his eyes.
MCMURPHY: No way.
CHESWICK: No way. McMurphy starts tearing his sheet of paper up into a thousand Then I suggest we turn our attention back to Mister Harding's problem. Would anybody care to She looks around. McMurphy is slouched in his chair. Harding puts his hands up. No one else does.
BIG NURSE: ( checking her watch ) Then I suggest we turn our attention back to Mister Harding's problem. Would anybody care to She looks around. McMurphy is slouched in his chair. Harding puts his hands up. No one else does.
HARDING: Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain. No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of. Yes. Yes. The question of. Existence. Relationship. Function. Confront. Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis. Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem. the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow. Somehow to understand fully our capacity. to obtain. to personify. the question. existence depends. depends on the question. to reflect. to Harding, breaks off, sweating; he begins to knead his forehead and chew his nails.
ANGLE: Silence as the CAMERA REFLECTS: the room, the patients, the staff, the hallways, the hospital, the grounds, the trees, the sky, ending on.
MCMURPHY: You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
MARTINI: Hold it a minute. There's a flurry of money from Martini, red, green and yellow bills blowing in every direction.
CHESWICK: Let's go, for Christsakes.
MCMURPHY: It's your dirty roll, Cheswick. Cheswick rolls the dice.
MCMURPHY: Snake eyes! Hoooeee, that puts you on my Marvin Gardens, which means you owe me three hundred and fifty Cheswick starts counting out the money.
MARTINI: What's thum other things? Hold it a minute. What's thum other things all over the board?
CHESWICK: ( to Martini ) How can a man concentrate with you sitting there hallucinating a mile a minute.
MCMURPHY: You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself. Your dice, Scanlon.
SCANLON: Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go. Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini. Martini picks up a house.
MCMURPHY: Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around. can't depend on nobody.
BILLY: ( from the next table ) Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway. McMurphy slams his fist down on the table, sending the monopoly pieces flying. Martini is crestfallen.
MCMURPHY: What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
HARDING: A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
MCMURPHY: It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I Oh, yeah?
CHESWICK: Oh, yeah?
FREDRICKSON: Oh, yeah?
MCMURPHY: Big man!
SEFELT: Big man!
MCMURPHY: Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
SEFELT: On what?
MCMURPHY: That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do. McMurphy sits and resumes his game of solitaire. Martini and Scanlon are putting the monopoly game back together again. Bromden spots ( or he thinks he spots ) one of the attendants listening at the door. He wants to warn the others, but doesn't know how.

He wants to warn the others, but doesn't know how.
SEFELT: Maybe he'll just show Miss Ratched his big thing an' she'll open the door for him. Sefelt and Frederickson smile at each other. Bromden slides along the wall toward the door.
MCMURPHY: Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy. Fredrickson and Sefelt snicker in their hands.
MCMURPHY: You think it's funny, huh?
TABER: Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place! Bromden reaches the door and looks out. No one is there.
MCMURPHY: Put your money where your mouth is, Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, Bromden turns back to the room to see McMurphy slam his fist down on the table; the monopoly game goes flying.
MCMURPHY: ( rising and turning on the others, who back off ) You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
MCMURPHY: All right! He looks wildly around the room, spots the machine, crosses to it and smacks it with his hand.
MCMURPHY: With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
HARDING: You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
MCMURPHY: You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
MCMURPHY: You heard me the first time!
TABER: I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
MCMURPHY: You're on!
BILLY: M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
MCMURPHY: Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
SEFELT: I'll bet a dollar.
FREDRICKSON: Me, too.
MCMURPHY: A nickel.
MARTINI: A nickel.
SCANLON: A dime.
MCMURPHY: Okay. Who else?
HARDING: Twenty-five dollars.
MCMURPHY: ( knows he's taking a bad bet ) Okay, Harding, you're on.
HARDING: Okay, sucker.
MCMURPHY: Yeah. Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen! The Acutes stand aside and McMurphy steps up to the machine. He shifts his feet to get a good stance, wipes his hands on his thighs, leans down and gets hold of the levers on each side, and strains. Bromden watches, in awe of McMurphy. McMurphy turns loose, straightens up and shifts his feet for a better position.
HARDING: Giving up?
MCMURPHY: Just warmin' up. He grabs the levers again. His whole body shakes with the strain. For just a second we HEAR the cement GRIND. Then his breath explodes and he falls back limp against the wall. There's blood on his hands. No sound but his rasping breath. He opens his eyes and looks around. Then pulls out a pocketful of IOU's and tries to sort them out, but his hands are frozen into red claws. He throws the whole bundle on the floor and walks out. At the door, he turns back.
MCMURPHY: But I tried. Goddammit, I sure as hell did that much. Didn't I? McMurphy exits.
BILLY: McMurphy turns away from Billy, who crosses to the other side of the bed.
HARDING: Leave him alone, he's pouting.
BILLY: Y-Y-Y-You leave him alone!
MCMURPHY: That's okay, kid.
BILLY: Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
MCMURPHY: No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
BILLY: What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
MCMURPHY: What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
BILLY: 'K-k-kay, Mack!
WASHINGTON'S POV: Way down the hall, the Group Meeting is SEEN in progress.
BIG NURSE: Try, Billy, try. Billy tries, but can't talk. The other Acutes are bored, restive, waiting. McMurphy has ants in his pants as Big Nurse speaks to Billy.
BILLY: BIG NURSE Tell us about it.
BIG NURSE: Tell us about it.
BILLY: I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh.' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing. Billy laughs at himself.
BIG NURSE: What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
BILLY: ( rubbing scars on his wrist ) I was in luh-love with her.
BIG NURSE: Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love? No response from Billy.
MCMURPHY: Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
BIG NURSE: Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
MCMURPHY: Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
BIG NURSE: Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
MCMURPHY: What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
CHESWICK: Yeah, let's vote on it!
BIG NURSE: Will one more vote satisfy you?
MCMURPHY: Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
BIG NURSE: Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
MCMURPHY: I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
BIG NURSE: ( to the patients ) A vote is before the group.
MCMURPHY: Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
BIG NURSE: Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand. The first hand to come up is Cheswick's. Then McMurphy's. Then Martini, Scanlon, Sefelt, Fredrickson, Billy and Taber. Harding doesn't vote. Big Nurse starts counting the hands. McMurphy, his face beaming, counts the hands.
MCMURPHY: That's it! We made it!
BIG NURSE: I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
MCMURPHY: So do I!
BIG NURSE: But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: ( the light dawning ) You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
BIG NURSE: I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
MCMURPHY: Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
BILLY: B-But, M-M-Miss R-Ratched, y-you n never c-c-counted th-their votes A beat.
BIG NURSE: ( losing ground ) You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
BILLY: Well, screw that noise! McMurphy rises and, taking his chair, he crosses toward the television set.
MCMURPHY: Well, screw that noise! McMurphy rises and, taking his chair, he crosses toward the television set.
BIG NURSE: Sit down, Mister McMurphy! McMurphy turns the TV on, flips the channel, then sits and waits for a picture.
MCMURPHY: Hoo-wee! Man, all I need me now is a can of beer and a red-hot. Cheswick gets up and starts across when
BIG NURSE: Sit down, Mister Cheswick. Cheswick stops and stands there, helpless to move.
CHESWICK: McMurphy is deep into the game.
MCMURPHY: ( jumping up and shouting at the blank TV screen ) A hit! It's a hit! He's rounding first, heading for second. Here comes the throw. He's sliding. and. he's safe! He's safe! ( McMurphy whistles and claps his hands ) Hoo-wee! Whatta game! Whatta game! Come on, Koufax! Strike 'em out! The Acutes are stunned at McMurphy's outburst.
MCMURPHY: He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside Sefelt, Fredrickson, Billy and Taber get up and cross toward the TV. Harding is the only one who doesn't join them.
MCMURPHY: ( focusing in on TV screen ) He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch. and it's a hit! It's a hit!
MARTINI: ( jumping up and down ) I saw thum! I saw thum!
SCANLON: Me, too! Me, too!
SEFELT: Yes, I see it! I see it!
MCMURPHY: ( on his feet, shouting ) Ya-hoo, let's'play ball! The other Acutes pick up on McMurphy and start shouting at the blank TV screen.
ACUTES: It's a hit! A triple! It's a home run! A double! He's out! Whadaya blind? He's safe by a mile!
MCMURPHY: 'Kay, it's two outs, bases loaded as Koufax steps up to the mound. Checks the runners. goes into his wind-up. Here comes the three-two pitch. And it's a fly ball into deep center. Mantle is going back. He's going back! Back! His back is up against the wall. and. he catches it! He catches it! The Acutes are shouting, cheering, stomping and dancing in each other's arms.
SPIVEY: How are you feeling?
MCMURPHY: Just fine, Doc. In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
SPIVEY: Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
MCMURPHY: Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
SPIVEY: Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
MCMURPHY: Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
SPIVEY: Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case. This is the kiss of death to McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
SPIVEY: I'm afraid not.
MCMURPHY: Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
SPIVEY: No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
MCMURPHY: Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
SPIVEY: I'm sorry, but I can't keep you We'll let you know. REACTION SHOT of McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: We'll let you know. REACTION SHOT of McMurphy.
SPIVEY: We'll let you know. REACTION SHOT of McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: ( with great physical and vocal emphasis throughout entire scene ) Okay, Chief. This is your spot! I don't want you to move from this spot! Never!. 'Kay, now, take the ball! Raise your hands, like McMurphy raises his hands above his head. Bromden follows That's good! That's a good boy, Chief! Now jump and put it in! McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't. McMurphy does this a couple of times. Each time Bromden remains motionless.
MCMURPHY: That's good! That's a good boy, Chief! Now jump and put it in! McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't. McMurphy does this a couple of times. Each time Bromden remains motionless.
HARDING: He can't hear you!
MCMURPHY: I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
HARDING: So why are you talking to him?
MCMURPHY: I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
HARDING: It doesn't help him.
MCMURPHY: Well, it doesn't hurt him either! Does it, Chief! See, it doesn't hurt him. Jump! An' put it in! McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't move.
HARDING: Well, I think you're just confusing Bromden jumps.
MCMURPHY: Ha! Did ya see that! Hey, Cheswick!
CHESWICK: Yeah, Mack?
MCMURPHY: Come here! Cheswick runs over.
CHESWICK: Yeah, Mack?
MCMURPHY: Let me get on your shoulders.
CHESWICK: Sure, Mack. McMurphy climbs on his shoulders.
MCMURPHY: 'Kay, wheel me around to the basket. 'Kay, easy, easy. Hold it! 'Kay, now. Hey, Chief, come back! Bromden doesn't hear.
MCMURPHY: Cheswick, go get 'im! Cheswick goes after Bromden, catches him, and McMurphy latches onto him.
MCMURPHY: Now, wheel me to the basket. Cheswick, straining under the weight of McMurphy, turns toward the basket.
MCMURPHY: ( pointing to the floor ) Wait here, Chief. ( more to himself as he starts down hall ) Heh, heh, I'll show 'em who's INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT McMurphy is nudging Cheswick awake.
MCMURPHY: Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
CHESWICK: ( waking up ) Yeah, Mack, what is it?
MCMURPHY: I'm leaving. Goodbye!
CHESWICK: ( sitting up ) Where ya goin', Mac?
MCMURPHY: McMurphy turns and crosses to Billy.
MCMURPHY: ( waking Billy ) Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
BILLY: ( waking up ) W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
MCMURPHY: So long, kid.
BILLY: McMurphy turns from the bewildered Billy and crosses to
MCMURPHY: McMurphy turns from the bewildered Billy and crosses to
MCMURPHY: ( nudging Martini awake ) Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
MARTINI: ( waking up ) Yeah, Mac?
MCMURPHY: McMurphy turns to Scanlon.
MCMURPHY: Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
SCANLON: ( waking up ) Yeah, what's up?
MCMURPHY: Shhhh. See ya around the ball park. McMurphy crosses to Fredrickson and wakes him.
FREDRICKSON: ( waking up ) What? What?
MCMURPHY: So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
FREDRICKSON: ( sitting up ) The other patients are sitting up, some of them getting out of bed as McMurphy turns to Sefelt who is snoring. McMurphy pinches his nose and Sefelt wakes up.
MCMURPHY: The other patients are sitting up, some of them getting out of bed as McMurphy turns to Sefelt who is snoring. McMurphy pinches his nose and Sefelt wakes up.
MCMURPHY: Bye-bye, pussy cat. McMurphy crosses to Taber.
MCMURPHY: ( waking Taber ) Up an' at 'em, Taber.
TABER: ( waking up ) What's going on?
MCMURPHY: Shhhh. Time to say goodbye. McMurphy turns and crosses to Harding.
MCMURPHY: Hey, Hard-on. Wake up, Dumbo. Harding opens his eyes and looks at McMurphy.
HARDING: What for?
MCMURPHY: I'm busting outta this place.
HARDING: That's nice. Send me a post card. Harding turns his back to McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: ( turning to the others who have gathered around ) So long suckers.
BILLY: Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
CHESWICK: How ya gettin' out, Mac?
MCMURPHY: Shhh. That's for me to know an' you to find out.

MCMURPHY: Oh, yeah?
TABER: How much ya wanna bet?
MCMURPHY: How much ya wanna bet?
MCMURPHY: You're on. Let's go! An' keep it quiet. McMurphy starts down the aisle. The others follow.
BILLY: Wh-wh-what's d-d-down th-there, M-M Where's it go?
TABER: Where's it go?
MCMURPHY: Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.

SEFELT: Me too.
MARTINI: I wanna see it.
SCANLON: Me too! Me too!

MCMURPHY: 'Kay, let's see. Cheswick first . then Billy. Martini. Scanlon. Sefelt. Fredrickson. Taber an' the Chief. 'Kay
PATIENTS: ( simultaneously ) INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT The patients are waiting in the tunnel, which is used as an underground connecting system to the institutional buildings, as McMurphy gets out of the dumbwaiter.
MCMURPHY: INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT The patients are waiting in the tunnel, which is used as an underground connecting system to the institutional buildings, as McMurphy gets out of the dumbwaiter.
MCMURPHY: ( looking around ) Where's Martini and Scanlon?
CHESWICK: ( pointing ) They went that way.
MCMURPHY: Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
CHESWICK: Right, Mack! Far down the tunnel Martini and Scanlon are briefly SEEN as they skitter across the tunnel.
SEFELT: There they are!
MCMURPHY: Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here! Come on, let's get 'em! McMurphy starts down the tunnel. The others don't move.
MCMURPHY: ( calling back ) Come on, you guys, let's stick The Acutes follow McMurphy. They run down to the intersection and turn the corner. No sign of Martini or Scanlon. Somewhere a DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING CLOSED and FOOTSTEPS are HEARD coming their way.
TABER: Somebody's coming!
MCMURPHY: ( he listens then ) This way! McMurphy hustles the men round the corner as two aides pushing a gurney come wheeling by.
BILLY: I-I-I th-th-think we sh-sh-should go back!
SEFELT: Yeah, my feet are gettin' cold.
FREDRICKSON: Mine, too!
MCMURPHY: We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
ACUTES: ( simultaneously ) 'Kay, Mack! The band takes off down tbe tunnel, calling out in loud whispers, "Martini! Scanlon! Psst! Where are you?" Down one tunnel and up another till they turn a corner and see an open door. They go to the door and peer out. Steps lead up to the outside world.
MCMURPHY: They must be up there!
CHESWICK: L-L-Let-'s go b-back! Several Acutes express the same desire.
BILLY: L-L-Let-'s go b-back! Several Acutes express the same desire.
MCMURPHY: Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
MCMURPHY: Fuck Miss Ratched! McMurphy crosses out and up the stairs. The Acutes look at each other. A beat, then:
CHESWICK: There they are!
MCMURPHY: ( his attention elsewhere ) Hey, what's that?
SEVERAL ACUTES: ( simultaneously ) What? Where?
MCMURPHY: ( pointing ) Over there!
SEFELT: ( squinting ) I don't know.
BILLY: I-i-it's a b-b-bus!
MCMURPHY: A bus?
MCMURPHY: Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
TABER: We'll get in trouble.
CHESWICK: Yeah, maybe we ought to go back, Yeah, my feet are cold.
FREDRICKSON: Yeah, my feet are cold.
SEFELT: My feet hurt.
BILLY: I-I-I'm w-w-wet.
MCMURPHY: ( walking towards the bus ) Go ahead! Go back! The Acutes cast frightened looks at each other then go after McMurphy. Martini and Scanlon join them.
TABER: Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
MCMURPHY: I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside. McMurphy lifts the hood to the bus and begins jumping the wire. The Acutes stand helplessly by as the engine turns over and catches. McMurphy closes the hood and gets on the bus to a chorus of, "Please, Mac, take us back. Please." McMurphy puts the bus in gear and the bus starts moving. The Acutes start running alongside of the bus calling out for McMurphy to take them back.
MCMURPHY: ( shouting to them ) Get on assholes! They leap on.
MCMURPHY: ( waving Bromden onto the bus ) Come on, Chief! Let's go! Bromden boards the bus. McMurphy lets out a war whoop as he closes the door and starts the bus moving.
PORTLAND 46: INT. BUS - NIGHT McMurphy is singing at the top of his lungs.
MCMURPHY: ( singing ) Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee.
BILLY: H-Hey, M-Mack.
MCMURPHY: Yeah, kid?
BILLY: W-W-Where we g-g-going?
CHESWICK: Yeah, where we going?
MCMURPHY: I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
MARTINI: I wanna go home!
SCANLON: Yeah, it's cold!
MARTINI: I'm hungry.
TABER: Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
MCMURPHY: Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
BILLY: 'K-Kay, M-Mack!
MCMURPHY: ( singing ) Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand.
MCMURPHY: ( as he steps out of the bus ) This is it! as McMurphy walks directly to the wall, alongside the door, lifts the edge of the siding, comes up with a key, opens the door and enters. A beat, then the lights go on inside the building.
MCMURPHY: Come on in an' warm up. You can put some of that gear on to keep warm. An' there's beer an' Coke in the cooler an' some food over here. They hesitate.
MCMURPHY: Come on, don't be shy now, you're among friends. The Acutes come in, Bromden bringing up the rear. Martini goes for the candy. Scanlon goes for the Coke. Sefelt and Fredrickson go for the wet weather gear and boots. The others go to the heater. Bromden stands in the middle of the Why don't one of you boys help ol' Chief there get warmed up? Billy goes to Bromden's aid as McMurphy crosses to a window and looks out. McMurphy turns and looks out the window. A long beat.
MCMURPHY: Why don't one of you boys help ol' Chief there get warmed up? Billy goes to Bromden's aid as McMurphy crosses to a window and looks out. McMurphy turns and looks out the window. A long beat.
CHESWICK: When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
MCMURPHY: ( looking out the window ) Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you The Acutes cross to the window and look out, saying, "What? What is it? Whadaya lookin' at? I don't see a thing."
MARTINI: Oh, look at the pretty boat.
ACUTES' POV: Nestled against the dock is a trim fishing trawler, beautifully framed in the bay window.
BILLY: Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that Martini gets a strike and loses it. Scanlon comes up and starts to take the pole from him.
MCMURPHY: Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that Martini gets a strike and loses it. Scanlon comes up and starts to take the pole from him.
SCANLON: My turn.
MARTINI: ( hanging onto the pole ) They start a tug of war. Fredrickson tries to break it up, when he gets a strike and his line spins out. Billy's fish breaks into the sun in a shower of silver scales, and he gets so excited he lets the end of the pole go down and the line snaps.
MCMURPHY: Up, I told you! Keep that tip up. up! You had you one big silver Fredrickson lands his salmon in a spray of scales and blood. The fish is flopping all over the deck. Billy grabs the fish and wrestles it down. Bromden lands a fish when
REVERSE SHOT: Deep down in the water a gigantic white form slowly rises out of the depths, becoming solid, alive.
SCANLON: Jesus God.
MARTINI: What is it?
FREDRICKSON: We'll never get that on the boat. The fish is now clearly SEEN.
BILLY: ( calling ) M-M-Mack! M-M-Mack! McMurphy pulls himself up.
MCMURPHY: What is it, kid?
BILLY: C-C-Come here and l-look at th McMurphy crosses down and looks over the side.
MCMURPHY: He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
FREDRICKSON: Does that mean we have to cut him Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.
MCMURPHY: Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.
BILLY: I-I-I'll get them.
MARTINI: Me, too.
SCANLON: Me, too. McMurphy turns to Sefelt who is sweating under the strain.
MCMURPHY: Steady does it, Sefelt!
SEFELT'S POV: The massive fish is closer to the surface.
VOICE: ( over bull horn ) All right! Stand to! Stand to! The men look up.
SPIVEY: ( to Big Nurse ) Here they are, Miss Ratched. Safe and sound!
BIG NURSE: Good. Well, boys, did you enjoy A burst of exuberance as the inmates hold up their fish.
FREDRICKSON: ( to Sefelt ) Show her the one you caught, Jim. Sefelt whips the sheet off the big fish.
BIG NURSE: My, my. No one can find superlatives or gestures big enough to describe his catching of the big fish, "brought it in himself" AD LIB.
MCMURPHY: Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
BIG NURSE: Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
MCMURPHY: ( loudly ) Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't No, it was irresponsible! Big Nurse turns to the others, leaving McMurphy dangling.
BIG NURSE: No, it was irresponsible! Big Nurse turns to the others, leaving McMurphy dangling.
MARTINI: ( crossing to McMurphy ) Gimme a cigarette!
SEFELT: I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
MCMURPHY: ( reaches in his pocket; he has none ) I don't have any. AD LIBS: "They could use it." "Take a picture first."
MARTINI: ( to Harding ) Gimme a cigarette!
HARDING: Why not?
MARTINI: Why not?
HARDING: I'm not running a charity ward. Martini snaps the cigarette out of Harding's hand, and takes off with Harding chasing him. Martini dashes around the room, pulling chairs in Harding's way, taking a drag on the cigarette whenever he can. Harding corners Martini, but Martini tosses the cigarette over Harding's head to Scanlon. Scanlon takes off with Harding after him, absolutely livid. Scanlon passes to Billy who passes to Martini. Everyone in the room is getting wired. Martini throws it away as Harding jumps him and nails him to the floor.
MARTINI: ( holding his hands up; empty ) All gone! All gone! Don't hit! Don't hit! Harding starts pounding Martini's head on the floor when Billy and Scanlon jump Harding and start pounding him. Fredrickson picks up the cigarette and stands there watching the fight as he smokes the cigarette as Washington, Warren and Miller move in and start separating the men. McMurphy, watching the fight, sighs, then deliberately crosses toward the Nurses' Station.
MCMURPHY: I'm sure sorry, ma'am. Gawd, but I am. That window glass was so clean I didn't even see it. McMurphy turns and crosses back to the day room, opening the carton of cigarettes as he goes.
MCMURPHY: You guys want cigarettes! Here's the goddamn cigarettes! McMurphy starts tossing packages of cigarettes into the mass of struggling bodies as Washington grabs McMurphy by the arm and tries to wheel him away. McMurphy shakes him off and throws a pack of cigarettes in Washington's face. Washington goes after McMurphy, grabs him, and drives him against the wall, right next to Bromden, who watches as McMurphy shoves Washington away, goes into a crouch and starts circling Washington. Washington dances in and out, chipping away at McMurphy's face until McMurphy drives his fist square into Washington's white, starched chest, drawing him against the wall. McMurphy moves in for the kill.
WASHINGTON: Warren! Miller! The Acutes have stopped fighting and are watching. McMurphy tags Washington, then is grabbed from behind by Warren, who pulls him back. Washington moves in and goes to work on McMurphy, when Bromden grabs Washington, from behind, in a bear hug. Miller jumps on Bromden's back. Bromden, still holding Washington, backs up into the wall, squashing Miller, who screams out.
AIDE: ( pointing to a bench ) Wait over there. The three aides go down the hall, leaving McMurphy and Bromden who sit and look at their new surroundings. There is a man sitting next to them. McMURPHY'S POV The architecture is the same as the ward we left below, but it is the atmosphere that is different. A heaviness pervades all. Heavily sedated patients sit isolated from each other. Others stand shifting from one foot to the other, while others walk up and down the hallway, their locomotive powers not unlike that of Parkinson's Disease ( caused by too much sedation ). Suddenly, one patient gets up, speaking very angrily, shouting incoherently at no one; he crosses the hall and enters a side room. An aide goes in after him. A long beat, then the aide comes out with the patient and gently leads him back to his seat, talking softly to the man. Further down the hallway, a gurney is wheeled out of the east room with a patient lying on it, out cold; he is wheeled further down the hall to the men's dorms, where he is left to sleep it off. Two aides come out of the EST room and head in McMurphy's direction, where one of the aides motions to the patient sitting next to McMurpby.
ANOTHER ANGLE: As McMurphy watches the patient go, he takes out a package of gum. Takes a stick for himself and gives Bromden one. McMurphy turns back to his own thoughts.
BROMDEN: Thank you. McMurphy looks up. A long beat.
MCMURPHY: Say it again.
BROMDEN: Thank you. Another beat.
MCMURPHY: Say. God Bless America!
BROMDEN: God Bless America.
MCMURPHY: ( slapping his thigh ) Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
BROMDEN: Shit! This is too much! Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
MCMURPHY: Shit! This is too much! Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
BROMDEN: Ya like that, Chief, huh?
MCMURPHY: Ya like that, Chief, huh?
BROMDEN: Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins. Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor.
MCMURPHY: Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins. Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor.
BROMDEN: Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never talk! Remember, this is just between you an' me. Do ya Bromden nods.
MCMURPHY: Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never talk! Remember, this is just between you an' me. Do ya Bromden nods.
MCMURPHY: ( recognizing a long-lost friend ) Hey, how ya doin'?
NURSE ITSU: Fine, thank you. Here, please take these.
MCMURPHY: What are they?
NURSE ITSU: To help you relax. please. McMurphy takes the pills and downs them. Bromden takes his Please take off your shoes. McMurphy takes off his shoes.
MCMURPHY: ( rising, thumbs up ) You an' me, Chief. McMurphy, flanked by the two aides, follows Nurse Itsu to the EST room.
MCMURPHY: ( to Itsu ) You know, I never got your name.
NURSE ITSU: ( stopping at the door ) Miss Itsu. ( indicating the room ) In here, please.
MCMURPHY: You comin' in to hold my hand?
NURSE ITSU: Yeah. Well, see ya around, Itsu. Itsu smiles at McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: Yeah. Well, see ya around, Itsu. Itsu smiles at McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: McMurphy gives Bromden one last wave and goes in. Bromden watches the door close behind McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: ( as he enters ) McMurphy looks around at the six aides.
MCMURPHY: You boys can take a cigarette break The Nurse smiles at him.
DOCTOR: That's all right, Mister McMurphy, just climb on the bed and lie Whatever you say, Doc. McMurphy climbs on the bed and lies down. The Doctor moves around to the side of the bed and takes McMurphy's pulse, while the Nurse dips her fingers into a jar of salve.
MCMURPHY: Whatever you say, Doc. McMurphy climbs on the bed and lies down. The Doctor moves around to the side of the bed and takes McMurphy's pulse, while the Nurse dips her fingers into a jar of salve.
DOCTOR: ( to McMurphy ) This won't hurt you at all.
MCMURPHY: Uh, uh. The Nurse starts applying salve to McMurphy's temples.
MCMURPHY: What's that for?
NURSE: ( smiling up at her ) Surely, goodness and mercy will follow this, eh, honey?
MCMURPHY: ( smiling up at her ) Surely, goodness and mercy will follow this, eh, honey?
DOCTOR: ( holding a mouthpiece ) Please, put this in your mouth. McMurphy takes the bit in his teeth. The Doctor moves back to the head of the gurney and places the thongs on McMurphy's The Doctor nods to the six aides, who move in and gently place their hands, in a very professional manner, on McMurphy's knees, hips and shoulders. Once set, the Doctor turns to his controls. SHOT OF McMURPHY as he looks around, not nearly as scared as he is mystified by the whole process, when suddenly, without warning, McMurphy is hit by the shock. His face is a contorted mask of surprise and pain. His whole body caught in a sudden spasm. A moment of rigidity, then McMurphy passes out and his body relaxes. Another moment, then a series of violent body spasms begin flowing down his body. Now the aides' function is very clear, as they press down, holding McMurphy firmly to the gurney, until the last spasm subsides.
BIG NURSE: ( to Sefelt ) It's been brought to my attention that you're giving Mister Fredrickson your medication, aren't you, Mister Sefelt?
SEFELT: It's the Dilantin that makes my gums soft!
BIG NURSE: Now, Jim, you must be honest with At the end of the hall, the door opens and McMurphy and Bromden enter the visitors' room, accompanied by Washington and Warren. They cross to the security gate, open it and pass into the hallway. Washington and Warren disappear into a room, leaving McMurphy and Bromden, who walk slowly towards the day room. The Group Meeting continues over as Fredrickson raises his Yes, Mister Fredrickson?
FREDRICKSON: I wanna know why the dorm has to be locked in the daytime and on Yeah, why can't a fellow even have the weekends to himself?
TABER: Yeah, why can't a fellow even have the weekends to himself?
CHESWICK: ( standing up ) Yeah, whadabout our cigarettes?
BIG NURSE: Sit down, Mister Cheswick, and wait your turn! He sits.
FREDRICKSON: So what? Is it a mortal sin? I mean, normal people get to sleep late on weekends.
BIG NURSE: With few exceptions, time spent in the company of others is therapeutic, while every minute spent brooding alone only increases Everyone looks at McMurphy and Bromden. Bromden is as he always was, as McMurphy slowly drags himself into the day room. He looks like a zombie as he takes the room in. Then, suddenly, he slaps his thigh. Hey, hey, you ding-a-lings, you creeps, you goons. He enters the room doing a jig. The Acutes' faces light up.
CHESWICK: ( jumping up as he sees McMurphy ) Everyone looks at McMurphy and Bromden. Bromden is as he always was, as McMurphy slowly drags himself into the day room. He looks like a zombie as he takes the room in. Then, suddenly, he slaps his thigh. Hey, hey, you ding-a-lings, you creeps, you goons. He enters the room doing a jig. The Acutes' faces light up.
MCMURPHY: I got ten thousand watts and hot to trot. First woman takes me on is gonna light up like a pinball machine an' pay off in silver McMurphy does a full circle of the room, greeting the Chronics. But it's an effort for him. His voice is slower, his footwork slightly out of sync.
BILLY: H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
MCMURPHY: Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my Mister McMurphy.
BIG NURSE: Mister McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: ( turning ) Yes, ma'am?
BIG NURSE: Welcome back.
MCMURPHY: Thank you, ma'am.
BIG NURSE: I hope everything is settled.
MCMURPHY: Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc! Spivey greets McMurphy.
BIG NURSE: Good. Why don't you join us?
MCMURPHY: Why, thank you, ma'am. Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else! Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game? I figured as much.
BILLY: W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
MCMURPHY: Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'. While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan. A great sadness suddenly sweeps over McMurphy's face and he breaks off.
BILLY: Wh-wh-what p-plan, M-Mack! No response from McMurphy.
HARDING: What's your plan, Mack?
MCMURPHY: ( coming out of it ) Plan?. Oh, yeah, the plan. McMurphy gets up and crosses to the window, where he joins Bromden who is looking out the window. REACTION SHOT of the others as they look at McMurphy and each other with quizzical looks.
PHOTOGRAPHER: ( wrapping it up ) Thank you, boys. The line breaks up. McMurphy crosses to Big Nurse, who sits in the front row. It's the big Saturday game between the Acutes and Aides, as spectators enter the gymnasium already half-filled with male and female patients, staff members and visitors. Doctor Spivey stands nearby at the timers' table, basketball in hand, whistle around his neck, talking to the timer.
MCMURPHY: Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
BIG NURSE: Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with Thank you, ma'am. O.S. the WHISTLE BLOWS.
MCMURPHY: Thank you, ma'am. O.S. the WHISTLE BLOWS.
MCMURPHY: Gotta go now, ma'am.
BIG NURSE: Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: Thank you, ma'am. McMurphy crosses onto the court. Big Nurse watches him go.
BASKETBALL COURT: Doctor Spivey is at half-court, basketball in hand as the players take up their positions: Washington faces McMurphy for the jump at center. Harding and Billy are playing guard with Warren and Miller on them. Martini and Scanlon are in the forward position, with the two white Aides covering them. The other Acutes sit on the bench as substitutes.
MCMURPHY: ( to Washington ) Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
WASHINGTON: Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth How 'bout twenty?
MCMURPHY: How 'bout twenty?
WASHINGTON: Now you talkin'.
MCMURPHY: Bet you ass.
WASHINGTON: Bet you ass.
MCMURPHY: ( to Spivey ) You're a witness, Doc!
SPIVEY: Me? I didn't hear a thing! Let's play ball! Spivey checks the court, then blows the whistle as he tosses the ball into the air. Washington taps the ball to Warren, who passes to Miller, who hands off to Washington, who goes up for a layup. Two points. The Acutes haven't even moved from their spots. The scoreboard reads: AIDES 2 PATIENTS 0.
MCMURPHY: ( taking the ball out ) Come on, wake up, you ding-a-lings. The game is on. The Acutes snap to and McMurphy passes the ball into Harding, who fiercely dribbles down court, McMurphy running alongside Pass the ball, Harding. ( no pass ) Don't hang onto it. ( no response ) Pass it, goddammit! Harding dribbles into the corner and finds himself bottled in by two Aides.
MCMURPHY: Pass the ball, Harding. Don't hang onto it. Pass it, goddammit! Harding dribbles into the corner and finds himself bottled in by two Aides.
MCMURPHY: Harding, here, over here! The ball is snagged from Harding's hands by an Aide, who passes it down court to another Aide, who turns and makes another basket. Scoreboard: AIDES 4 PATIENTS 0
MCMURPHY: ( to Harding ) Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
HARDING: What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
MCMURPHY: I was open! Come on, let's play McMurphy and Harding turn to see Martini, down court, passing the ball into Billy.
WASHINGTON: ( slapping his hands ) Gimme tha' ball! Billy panics and hands the ball to Washington, who turns around and makes another basket. Score: AIDES 6 PATIENTS 0. McMurphy and Harding run down court, McMurphy taking the ball away from Martini, who would like to bring it in.
MCMURPHY: ( to Washington ) What kind of crap is that???
MCMURPHY: ( to Martini ) Get down there where ya belong, Martini. You, too, Scanlon. ( tosses ball to Harding ) You take it out, Harding! Harding takes the ball and passes it in to McMurphy, who turns and dribbles down court exactly like Harding did.
HARDING: ( running alongside McMurphy ) Pass the ball! ( no response ) Pass it! ( no response ) Pass it! Pass it! I'm open, McMurphy, pass the ball! McMurphy stops dead in his tracks and flings the ball at Harding. The ball bounces off Harding's head and goes out of bounds. The WHISTLE BLOWS. Harding spins a few times.
MCMURPHY: ( calling out ) Candy. Candy, over here. ( to Doctor Spivey ) Hey, Doc, time out.
SPIVEY: ( blowing his whistle ) Time out! McMurphy tosses the ball to Spivey, then crosses the court to Candy and Rose, who have had a couple of drinks on the way Mack, you sonofabitch, you ol' fucker, how've you been?
CANDY: Mack, you sonofabitch, you ol' fucker, how've you been?
MCMURPHY: ( swinging her around in his arms ) Terrific, baby, terrific! ( to Rose ) Hi ya doin', Rose?
ROSE: Okay, Mack! Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
MCMURPHY: ( to Candy ) How's your ass been holdin' up, Candy pokes her ass at McMurphy. He gives it a squeeze. O.S. a WHISTLE BLOWS.
MCMURPHY: Come on, girls, we're holding up the game! McMurphy leads the two ladies across the court. The entire gymnasium is riveted on the three of them. As they reach Big Nurse:
MCMURPHY: Miss Ratched, this is my Aunt Candy and her friend Rose. Greetings are exchanged.
MCMURPHY: Miss Ratched was kind enough to save you ladies a seat. The two ladies wedge themselves in next to Big Nurse. O.S. the WHISTLE BLOWS.
MCMURPHY: Talk to ya at half time! McMurphy turns and crosses onto the court.
CANDY: ( calling after him ) Sock it to 'em, kid!
ROSE: ( taking in the players ) Are they all crazies?
BIG NURSE: Oh, just those guys dressed in No, miss, it's the other way Well, you could've fooled me. On the court, McMurphy throws the ball to Martini. Martini throws the ball to McMurphy. McMurphy throws the ball back to Martini. Martini throws the ball into the stands. The WHISTLE BLOWS O.S.

Bromden can hardly contain himself as he waits for McMurphy to go into his act. The Acutes have already absorbed the reality of McMurphy's condition as they exchange looks with each other.
FREDRICKSON: ( whispering ) Yeah, that Gary Blinker is fulla The Acutes turn back to their card game as Harding shuffles and deals the cards out. Bromden keeps his eyes glued to Big Nurse and McMurphy.
HARDING: Yeah, that Gary Blinker is fulla The Acutes turn back to their card game as Harding shuffles and deals the cards out. Bromden keeps his eyes glued to Big Nurse and McMurphy.
SCANLON: Yeah, that Gary Blinker is fulla The Acutes turn back to their card game as Harding shuffles and deals the cards out. Bromden keeps his eyes glued to Big Nurse and McMurphy.
BIG NURSE: ( sitting McMurphy down ) Here now, you sit here. That's Big Nurse pats McMurphy's face and crosses back to the nurses' station. McMurphy just sits there, his head lolling to one side. Bromden waits for McMurphy to go into his routine. McMurphy just sits there. Bromden snaps his fingers and slaps his thigh, then waits for McMurphy to follow suit. McMurphy just sits there slobbering. Bromden slaps his thigh again. No response from McMurphy. The MUSIC PLAYS ON.
BROMDEN'S POV: The patients are all asleep. The new night attendant is fast asleep in the nurses' station. Bromden quietly takes his pillow and goes to McMurphy's bed, where he kneels and puts his head very close to McMurphy's. A long beat as Bromden studies McMurphy's face.
BROMDEN: ( whispering in McMurphy's ear ) When I first came here I was so scared of being lost I had to holler so they could track me. I figured anything was better than being lost. On the last word, Bromden places his pillow over McMurphy's face and begins to suffocate him. McMurphy starts thrashing and Bromden lies full length on McMurphy. A long beat, then the thrashing ends. Bromden gets off McMurphy, replaces his pillow, and crosses down the aisle toward the day room.
