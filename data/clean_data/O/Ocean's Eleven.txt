ANOTHER ANGLE: MOVING WITH him and Topher Grace, the actor, as they push down a back alley.
TOPHER: Hey, I don't know if you're, uh, you know, incorporated or anything, like Rusty Ryan. And, I don't know, incorporated, but you should think about it, really, 'cause I was talking to my manager yesterday
RUSTY: ( CONTINUED )
TOPHER: No, not Bernie, I mean not, not that Bernie, my business manager, he's also Bernie, he was telling me that since this, what we do, could be considered research for, you know, a future gig, that I should be able to write it off as a business expense. So he suggested that it'd be better if I wrote you a check, and thereby
TOPHER: Or, or we could keep it cash.
RUSTY: Alright. Who's here?
TOPHER: Josh is here. Seth is here. David couldn't make it. He's got two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania because somebody just figured out forty percent of the budget is coming from Germany.
RUSTY: That's a problem.
TOPHER: Barry is here.
RUSTY: I thought they let him out to do that H.B.O. thing in Vancouver.
TOPHER: Couldn't work the dates. Oh, and he brought his girlfriend.
RUSTY: Not the one from

RUSTY: ( beat ) I quit watching when Kate left Don after his accident.
RUSTY: Good evening, guys. Let's play some cards. . and let's play some cards.
RUSTY: . and let's play some cards.
TOPHER: A hundred bucks to me. Ah, what the hell. Pocket change. Call.
RUSTY: Why you bet a certain way is your business. But you have to make them think you're betting for a reason. Understand?
RUSTY: Seth. You know what you have. Looking at them doesn't change them. Leave 'em where they are and make your bet.
RUSTY: You're showing. Yeah, I know she's your girlfriend, Barry, but you can't. Thank you.
RUSTY: Josh. Deal to your left.
WAITRESS: One McCallum neat. And four bottled waters.
SETH: ( triumphantly ) Two pair nines and twos.
RUSTY: ( folding ) You got me. ( as Seth rakes in Let's take a little break.
BARTENDER: ( shouting over music ) How's the game going?!!
RUSTY: It's been the longest hour of my life.
BARTENDER: ( at the same volume ) I'm running away with your wife.
RUSTY: ( at the same volume ) I'm running away with your wife.
BARTENDER: Cool, man!
TOPHER: Hey, Rusty, we got another player, if that's alright.
RUSTY: What's this?
DANNY: The bouncer mentioned there was a game in progress. I hope I'm not intruding.
TOPHER: No intrusion at all
RUSTY: What was his name, the bouncer's?
DANNY: I don't remember.
RUSTY: A card player with amnesia. This should be fun.
TOPHER: What do you do for a living, Mr. Ocean? If you don't mind my asking.
DANNY: Why should I mind? Two cards, I just got out of prison.
TOPHER: ( a glance among the ( half to divert Barry, you're showing again.
RUSTY: ( half to divert Barry, you're showing again.
JOSH: What'd you, uh, go to prison for?
DANNY: I stole things.
JOSH: What, like jewels? Diamonds?
RUSTY: Incan matrimonial headmasks.
JOSH: From a museum?
DANNY: There a lot of money in those? Incan matrimonial.
SETH: There a lot of money in those? Incan matrimonial.
DANNY: Headmasks. Some.
RUSTY: Don't let him fool you, Seth. There's boatloads. If you can move the things. One card to me. . but you can't.
DANNY: My fence seemed confident enough.
RUSTY: If you're dealing with cash, you don't need a fence.
DANNY: Some people just lack vision.
RUSTY: Probably everybody in cell block E.
DANNY: Well, that's all behind us now.
RUSTY: I should hope so.
DANNY: I raise you five hundred dollars.
RUSTY: Guys: Day One: what's the first rule of poker?
RUSTY: That's right. My friend here just raised me out of pique. Today's lesson. How to draw out a bluff. This early in the game, that much money, I'm thinking he's holding nothing better than a pair of face cards. Seth, raise him.
SETH: Okay. Uh, your five hundred and. another two?
RUSTY: Seven to me. Plus three. What the hell.
TOPHER: Seven to me. Plus three. What the hell.
RUSTY: Indeed. But be careful you don't push him too high too fast. Want to keep him on the leash. I call.
JOSH: What's that to me? A thousand?
RUSTY: All you have to do is call.
DANNY: ( off Josh's further What? Your girlfriend holding your purse?
DANNY: Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say, Seth, I always check my cards before I make a bet. But be cafeful. I could tell from your face you're holding three of a kind or better. Five hundred to call. And two grand more.
RUSTY: Guys, you're free to do what you like. It's a lot of money. But I'm staying in. He's trying to buy his way out of his bluff.
RUSTY: We call.
RUSTY: Shit. Sorry, guys. I I was sure he was bluffing.
DANNY: Thanks for the game, fellas. Hey, I hate to ask this, but could you sign something for me? It's for the guys in the joint. They just love all your shows.
RUSTY: That was, that was just.
DANNY: Rusty agrees.
RUSTY: How was the clink? You get the cookies I sent you?
DANNY: Why do you think I came to see you
DANNY: Ten grand. Half of it's yours.
RUSTY: You barge into my new workplace, ruin my professional reputation, least you could do is tell me you've got something better for I've got something better for
DANNY: I've got something better for
RUSTY: How's Tess?
RUSTY: Alright. Tell me.
DANNY: It's tricky. No one's ever done it before. Needs planning, a large crew.
RUSTY: Not loaded ones. It has to be very precise. There's a lot of security. But the take.
DANNY: Not loaded ones. It has to be very precise. There's a lot of security. But the take.
RUSTY: What's the target?
DANNY: Eight figures each.
RUSTY: What's. The. Target.
DANNY: ( deep breath, then ) When's the last time you were in What? You wanna knock over a
RUSTY: What? You wanna knock over a
DANNY: The vault at the Bellagio.
RUSTY: If I'm reading these right and I think that I am this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed. Oops. Actually, you know what, I'm wrong. It's definitely the least accessible vault ever
DANNY: Rusty's brow furrows just a little.
RUSTY: You said three casinos.
DANNY: ( flips to next These feed into the cages at both the Mirage and the M.G.M. Grand. ( tapping vault ) But every dime ends up here.
RUSTY: The Bellagio, Mirage, and. These are Terry Benedict's places.
DANNY: Yes, they are. Think he'll mind?
RUSTY: More than somewhat.
RUSTY: You'd need at least a dozen guys, doing a combination of cons.
DANNY: Like what, you think?
RUSTY: Well, off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. Oh, and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald Where do you think you're gonna get the money to back this?
DANNY: As long as we're hitting these three casinos, we'll get our bankroll. Terry Benedict has a list of enemies.
RUSTY: But does he have enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose.
DANNY: ( smiles, too )
RUSTY: 22 MOVING WITH SECURITY GUARD 22
DANNY: So, here's what I think: You should take this plan, kick it around for a week or two. Sleep on it. Turn it over in your head. Then: never bring it up to me Uh-huh. So what are you saying?
RUSTY: So, here's what I think: You should take this plan, kick it around for a week or two. Sleep on it. Turn it over in your head. Then: never bring it up to me Uh-huh. So what are you saying?
DANNY: Uh-huh. So what are you saying?
RUSTY: I'm saying: this is like trying to build a house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat.
DANNY: Really? I thought it was much harder than that
DANNY: Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little, will ya?
SECURITY GUARD: ( lowers beam ) You two done up here? Find what you wanted?
DANNY: Yeah, thanks. You mind if we borrow a couple drawings for the night? Make some copies.
SECURITY GUARD: Whatever you need.
DANNY: 'Preciate it.
RUSTY: I need a reason. And don't say Why do this?
DANNY: Why not do it?
DANNY: Because yesterday I walked out of the joint wearing my entire wardrobe and you're colddecking TeenBeat coverboys. Because the house always wins. You play long enough, never changing stakes, the house takes you. Unless, when that special hand comes around, you bet big. And then you take the house.
RUSTY: You're been practicing that speech, haven't you?
DANNY: A little. Did I rush it? It felt like I rushed it.
RUSTY: No, it was good.
RUSTY: I wonder what Reuben will say?
TISHKOFF: Are you listening to me? You are, both of you, nuts. I know more about casino security than any man alive. I invented it, and it cannot be beaten. They got cameras, they got watchers, they got locks, they got timers, they got vaults. They got enough armed personnel to occupy Paris. Okay, bad example.
DANNY: It's never been tried.
TISHKOFF: Oh, it's been tried. A few guys even came close. You know the three most successful robberies in Vegas history?
TISHKOFF: And the closest any man has gotten to robbing a Las Vegas casino.
TISHKOFF: Outside of Caesar's in '87. He came, he grabbed, he got
TISHKOFF: But what am I saying? You guys are pros, the best. I'm sure you can make it out of the casino. Of course, lest we forget, once you're out the front door, you're still in the middle of the fucking
RUSTY: You're right. He's right.
DANNY: Reuben, you're right. Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs.
RUSTY: That's exactly it. Pure ego.
TISHKOFF: Yeah yeah blah blah.
DANNY: Thank you so much for setting us straight. Sorry we bothered you.
TISHKOFF: Look, we all go way back. I owe you from that thing with the guy in the place, and I'll never forget it.
DANNY: It was our pleasure.
RUSTY: I'd never been to Belize.
TISHKOFF: Give Dominic your addresses, I got some remaindered furniture I wanna send you.
TISHKOFF: Just out of curiosity, which casinos did you geniuses pick to
DANNY: The Bellagio, Mirage, and the M.G.M. Grand.
TISHKOFF: ( nostrils flared, Those are Terry Benedict's Say, you know, he's right. You guys. Whadda you got against Terry Benedict?
RUSTY: Say, you know, he's right. You guys. Whadda you got against Terry Benedict?
TISHKOFF: You guys. Whadda you got against Terry Benedict?
DANNY: What do you have against him? That's the real question.
TISHKOFF: He torpedoed my casino, muscled me out, now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way for another fuckin' eyesore. Don't think I don't see what you're doin'.
RUSTY: What are we doing, Reuben?
TISHKOFF: You gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you better goddamn know. This sorta thing used to be civilized. You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you. Done. But Benedict. At the end of this he better not know you're involved, not know your names, or think you're dead. Because he'll kill you, and then he'll go to work on you.
DANNY: That's why we've got to be very careful. We have to be precise. We have to be well-funded.
TISHKOFF: Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. And you're gonna need a crew as nuts as you are. Who do you have in mind?
LIVINGSTON: D-don't, don't-don't. touch. it.
LIVINGSTON: Do you see me pulling the gun out of your holster and firing it?
RUSTY: ( next item on his Phil Turentine.
DANNY: Phil Turentine.
RUSTY: ( CONTINUED )
DANNY: No shit? On the job?
RUSTY: Sun cancer.
DANNY: You send flowers?
RUSTY: Dated his wife a while.
DANNY: ( onto next candidate )
RUSTY: ( checks his watch ) We may be too late.
BASHER: BANG! Wood shards and SPLINTERS of GLASS fly all around; Basher merely ducks his head and whistles. As the dust settles, three men move quickly past Basher and into ( what the settling fog now reveals to be ) a dynamited bank vault. ALARMS begin to sound: this is bad news.
BASHER: ( to the rest of his You know, you guys had one job to
COP: And that's all you used during the event? Nothing else?
BASHER: Are you accusing me of booby- Well, how 'bout it?
COP: Well, how 'bout it?
RUSTY: Isn't that right, Basher?
BASHER: That's right.
RUSTY: ( flashing badge, Peck, A.T.F. Let me venture a guess. A simple G4 mainliner, double-coil, backwound, quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet. ( off Cop's reaction ) That's our man. Tell me something else. Have you checked him for booby traps on his person? I mean really checked, not just for
RUSTY: Will you go find Griggs and tell him I need to see him?
COP: ( CONTINUED )
RUSTY: ( loud ) Just go find him, will you? ( as Cop stalks off; How fast can you put something together with what I passed you?
BASHER: Done. Thirty seconds all right?
RUSTY: From when?
BASHER: ( as we hear something
RUSTY: Ten seconds?
BASHER: Not quite. Is Danny here?
RUSTY: Around the corner.
BASHER: Be good working with professionals Okay: go.
RUSTY: Everyone down! Get down! There's a bomb in the.
DANNY: So he can walk on a rope.
RUSTY: More than that.
DANNY: So he can juggle. We need a grease man, not an acrobat. Who else is on the list?
RUSTY: He is the list.
DANNY: Who else?
RUSTY: Halfway across the wire, the funambulist sits. And very slowly, but without hesitation, he contorts himself into a ball, never losing his balance. Even Danny is
RUSTY: There's your grease man.
DANNY: We need Saul.
RUSTY: He won't come. He swore off the game a year ago.
DANNY: He get religion?
RUSTY: You can ask him.
DANNY: You can ask him.
RUSTY: I can ask.
SAUL: I saw you in the paddock before the second race, outside the men's room, when I placed my bet. I saw you before you even got up this How ya been, Saul?
RUSTY: How ya been, Saul?
SAUL: Never better.
RUSTY: What's with the orange?
SAUL: My doctor says I need vitamins.
RUSTY: So why don't you take vitamins?
SAUL: You come here to give me a I got a box seat. Come on.
RUSTY: I got a box seat. Come on.
RUSTY: I thought you drank bloody Mary's at the track, Saul.
SAUL: A man shouldn't drink on the job.
RUSTY: ( re: race ) Who we rooting for here?
SAUL: Number four.
SAUL: You gonna ask me? Or should I just say no and get it over with?
RUSTY: Saul, you're the best there is. You're in Cooperstown. What do you want?
SAUL: Nothin'. I got a duplex now, I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish, I'm seeing a nice lady, she works the unmentionables counter at Macy's. I've changed.
RUSTY: Guys like us don't change, Saul. We stay sharp or we get sloppy, but we don't change.
SAUL: Quit connin' me.
RUSTY: That your hound way in the back He breaks late. Everyone knows
SAUL: He breaks late. Everyone knows
SAUL: You gonna treat me like a grownup at least? Tell me what the scam

LINUS: Sorry 'bout that.
STOCKBROKER: No problem, guy.
DANNY: Hi, Linus. Sit down.
LINUS: Who are you?
DANNY: A friend of Bobby Caldwell's. Sit Bobby told me about you. Said you were the best set of hands he ever saw. Didn't expect to find you working wallets on the subway.
DANNY: Bobby told me about you. Said you were the best set of hands he ever saw. Didn't expect to find you working wallets on the subway.
LINUS: That wasn't work, that was
DANNY: You're either in or out, right What is it?
LINUS: What is it?
DANNY: A plane ticket. A job offer.
LINUS: You're pretty trusting pretty Bobby has every faith in you.

DANNY: That's the best lift I've seen you make yet.
LINUS: Las Vegas, huh?
DANNY: America's playground.
LIVINGSTON: Trick or treat.
TISHKOFF: What, you guys get a group rate or

TURK: You should. You'd like it. You'd like Provo.
VIRGIL: ( scarfing a jumbo Anybody see the salsa goes with
DANNY: Everybody eaten? Good. Everybody sober? Close enough. Most of you know each other already. You probably haven't met Linus Caldwell before, he's Bobby's kid outta Chicago.
DANNY: Okay. Before we start, nobody's on the line here yet. What I'm about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous. If that doesn't sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey. No hard feelings. Otherwise, come with me.
BASHER: What the hell.
LINUS: You're Bobby Caldwell's kid, huh?
TISHKOFF: You're Bobby Caldwell's kid, huh?

LINUS: That's wonderful. Get in the goddamn room.
TISHKOFF: That's wonderful. Get in the goddamn room.
DANNY: Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard. Otherwise known as the Bellagio, the Mirage, the M.G.M. Grand. Together, they're the three most profitable casinos in Las Vegas.
DANNY: Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault. Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it. And we're going to rob it.
LINUS: Smash-and-grab job, huh?
RUSTY: It's a little more complicated than that. Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three
DANNY: Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three
DANNY: Okay. Bad news first. This place houses a security system which rivals most nuclear missile silos. First: we have to get within the casino cages
RUSTY: ( indicating ) here, here, and here
DANNY: which anyone knows takes more than a smile. Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours. Past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky: the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint which we can't fake
RUSTY: which we can't fake
DANNY: and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - -
RUSTY: which we won't get.
DANNY: Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors
RUSTY: meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped.
DANNY: Once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man. Any questions?
RUSTY: ( in response ) No. Tunneling is out. There are Richter scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction. If a groundhog tried to nest there, they'd know about it. Anyone else?
TURK: You said something about good The Nevada Gaming Commission stipulates: a casino must hold in reserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on its floor. As I mentioned, this vault services each of the three casinos above it. That means: during the week, by law, it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin. On a weekend, between eighty and ninety million. On a fight night, like the one two weeks from tonight, the night we're going to rob it, at least a hundred and fifty million. Without breaking a sweat. Now there are eleven of us. Each with an equal share. You do the

RUSTY: That's what I said.
SAUL: I have a question. Say we do get into the cage, and through the security doors there, and down the elevator we can't move, and past the guards with guns, and into the vault we can't Without being seen by the cameras.
RUSTY: Without being seen by the cameras.
DANNY: ( off everyone's Oh, right. Sorry. I forgot to mention that.
SAUL: Say we do all that. We're just supposed to walk outta there with a hundred million dollars in cash on us without getting stopped?
DANNY: Saul looks panic-stricken; like that, his ulcer has flared up, and he pops a Rolaid in his mouth.
DANNY: Alright. Here's how we'll begin.

LIVINGSTON: Well, it's not the least accessible system I've seen, but it's close. I don't suppose they have a closed-circuit feed I could tap into?
LIVINGSTON: Then this is definitely a black bag job. Do they employ an in- house technician?
RUSTY: Two. And one of them is lonely.

BILLY TIM: I'm sorry?
FRANK: I swear by it. I try all sorts of lotions. I went through a fragrance-free period last year, but now I'm liking this new brand fortified with rose hip. My sister, you know, she uses the aloe vera with the sun screen built in.
BILLY TIM: ( just can't get Uh-huh. You said you'd be willing to pay in cash?
FRANK: I did. You know: they say cinnamon is wonderful for your pores. Read that on the internet. And that ideally you should be wearing gloves to bed, but I find that would interfere with my social agenda. Problem is: I get a reaction to camphor so I can't use traditional remedies.
BILLY TIM: If you could pay cash, I could probably drop the price a little. To, say, seventeen. . sixteen each.

RUSTY: Okay. Tell me about Benedict.
LINUS: The guy is a machine.
LINUS: Give him another ten seconds. As I said: a machine.
LINUS: As I said: a machine.
RUSTY: And that portfolio contains the codes to all the cage doors?
LINUS: Two minutes after they've been changed, he's got 'em in hand. I'll tell you: you guys picked a helluva target. He is as smart and ruthless as they come. The last guy caught cheating here, Benedict not only sent him up for ten years, he got the bank to seize the guy's home and dealership, I heard.
RUSTY: his brother-in-law's tractor dealership, I heard.
LINUS: He doesn't just go after your knees, he goes after your livelihood. And everyone-you- ever-met's livelihood.
RUSTY: You scared?
LINUS: You suicidal?

DANNY: 29:47. Everything okay in there?
RUSTY: But what doesn't beat the shit out of being a circus performer?
DANNY: What is it?
RUSTY: Tell me this isn't about her. Or I'll walk off the job right now. Tess. She's with Terry Benedict now. Tell me this isn't about screwing the guy who's screwing your wife.
DANNY: Tell me.
RUSTY: Tell me.
DANNY: It's not. About that. Entirely.

We weren't gonna steal from anybody didn't have it coming. And we were gonna play the game like we had nothing to lose. Well, I lost something. Someone. That's why I'm here.
RUSTY: Here's the problem: we're stealing two things now. And when push comes to shove, if you can't have both, which are you gonna choose? And remember: Tess doesn't divide eleven ways.
DANNY: If things go to plan, I won't be the one who has to make that
DANNY: How'd she look by the way? I've seen her happier.
RUSTY: I've seen her happier.

DANNY'S POV: The other side of the building, and two more guards arriving on the roof and moving toward the staircase: Linus will be trapped.
BASHER: ( who speaks Danny's mind ) Then there'll be two of us who need saving.
DANNY: He knows where we are.
DANNY'S POV: Both sets of guards appear on the rooftop, and find no Linus between them he's disappeared.
