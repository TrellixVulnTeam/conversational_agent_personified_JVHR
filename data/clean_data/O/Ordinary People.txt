CONRAD: But she loves my father. I know she loved my brother. It's me!
DR BERGER: Ha! Now we're back to the rotten kid routine! She can't love you because you're unlovable. Where does that leave your dad? How come he loves you? You're a rottenkid, doesn't he know that?
CONRAD: That's different. He feels responsible. Besides, he loves Ho, I get it! The guy's got no taste! He loves you, but he's Look. maybe she just can't express it the way you'd like her to. Maybe she's just afraid to show you what she feels.
DR BERGER: Ho, I get it! The guy's got no taste! He loves you, but he's Look. maybe she just can't express it the way you'd like her to. Maybe she's just afraid to show you what she feels.
CONRAD: What do you mean?
DR BERGER: I mean there's someone besides your mother you've got to forgive.
CONRAD: You mean me?

DR BERGER: Come on, Con. You know the rules.
CONRAD: Rules? What rules? Can't I have a few minutes?
DR BERGER: You think about it. Just think about it.
CONRAD: Conrad is out of breath.
FRIEND: Say. After going to a new high, it falls to 112 1/4 and then rallies on good volume. I shoot an order to buy 4000 at the market. If I get the 4000 shares at 113 3/4, I know something's wrong.
CALVIN: I'll see you, Cal.
FRIEND: I'll see you, Cal.
CALVIN: See you later.
FRIEND: ( OS ) Suppose the order to buy 4000 at
BETH: ( OS ) He walks all over us and you go up there and apologize to him.
FRIEND: ( OS ) 500 at 114.
CONRAD: ( OS ) It's all German pudding with you, dad, you don't see things.
BETH: ( OS ) You've been apologizing to him ever since he came home from the hospital. And you just don't see ( OS ) Tell her to stop it! You never tell her a godamn thing!
CONRAD: ( OS ) Tell her to stop it! You never tell her a godamn thing!
BETH: ( OS ) Buck never would have been in the ( OS ) She hates me! Can't you see that?
CONRAD: ( OS ) She hates me! Can't you see that?
CALVIN: ( OS ) I want to be clear.
DR BERGER: ( OS ) That's good.
CALVIN: In the car, I was thinking: "be clear.". I suppose that's what psychiatry's about. Being precise and clear. And honest, of course. I'll level with you. I'm not a great believer in psychiatry.
DR BERGER: I know what happens here is only between you and him, and.I like that, I respect that. And.he's better, I can see that. I am not trying to put you down, I just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for Neither do I.
CALVIN: I know what happens here is only between you and him, and.I like that, I respect that. And.he's better, I can see that. I am not trying to put you down, I just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for Neither do I.
DR BERGER: Neither do I.
CALVIN: I wish I knew what the hell I was doing here.
DR BERGER: Well, you said you. thought you could shed some light on some things. What did you mean by that?
CALVIN: I don't know actually, I'm not sure, I think I meant in terms of Conrad. You see, I knew something was wrong even before he tried to. to kill himself. But I thought that. It's clear that he's very smart. He's been an "A" student ever since he started school, and naturally I thought that .intelligent people could work out their own problems.
DR BERGER: But you still feel responsible?
CALVIN: Yeah, sure I do. It's hard not to. It was luck. It was just luck that I happened to be there when he tried it. I could have been at a meeting. We both could've been away. It was luck!
DR BERGER: You think of yourself as a lucky man, then?
CALVIN: No! No. No. I used to. I used to think. that I was a lucky person. before. the "accident". Mmm, I guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident, is it? What happens to you. I should do with it.
DR BERGER: That sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax Yeah. Maybe, maybe I am drifting a little. I can see myself, .and I can see the two of them drifting away from me, and I just stand there watching.
CALVIN: Yeah. Maybe, maybe I am drifting a little. I can see myself, .and I can see the two of them drifting away from me, and I just stand there watching.
DR BERGER: What would you want to do about Something. I gotta do something about it. I don't know what.
CALVIN: Something. I gotta do something about it. I don't know what.
DR BERGER: And you see them as on .opposite sides of this fence?
CALVIN: Yeah. No. I don't know. I see her not being able to forgive him.
DR BERGER: For what?
CALVIN: Oh, I don't know exactly. Being too much like her. People always think that she and Buck are. were .were alike. But it's really she and Conrad. They were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know? It's not easy for me to admit this but, uh. she didn't. His mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection. I'm not trying to put her down in any way at all. She is a wonderful woman, Did she give Buck much affection to Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck! Bucky got so much. I think what she felt for him was special. You know, he was her first-born. That's not unusual, is it?
DR BERGER: Did she give Buck much affection to Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck! Bucky got so much. I think what she felt for him was special. You know, he was her first-born. That's not unusual, is it?
CALVIN: Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck! Bucky got so much. I think what she felt for him was special. You know, he was her first-born. That's not unusual, is it?
DR BERGER: And you?
CALVIN: Me? I loved Buck.
DR BERGER: What I mean is, your wife's For me you mean?
CALVIN: For me you mean?
DR BERGER: ( CONTINUED )
CALVIN: Mmm. She's very. No. There's no problem with her for me. We've been. We've been married nearly twenty one years. Everybody loves Beth. But, huh. for Conrad, - it's been difficult. He didn't talk about that? We don't know what happens here. It doesn't come up. I guess that's what it is. It's private here. Isn't it?
DR BERGER: Mm-hmm. Very private.
CALVIN: I think I know why I came here. I think I came here to talk about Okay. Why don't we?
DR BERGER: Okay. Why don't we?
BETH: Calvin slowly opens the door. Car Buzzer Alarm. Calvin heavily comes out.
CALVIN: This will sound strange.
BETH: What happened?
CALVIN: Could we talk about Buck's funeral?
BETH: I know it'll seem trivial, but it's on my mind, or has been, and I'd just like to talk about it.
CALVIN: I know it'll seem trivial, but it's on my mind, or has been, and I'd just like to talk about it.
BETH: When I was getting dressed for Buck's funeral, I was.
CALVIN: When I was getting dressed for Buck's funeral, I was.
BETH: Calvin, what's the matter with you?
CALVIN: Just let me get it off my chest,OK?
BETH: What could getting dressed for Buck's funeral possibly have to do with anything right now?
CALVIN: I was wearing a blue shirt. And you said: - Wear a white shirt and the other shoes! It was nothing at the time. But it's always seemed to stay with me. And I, for some reason, been thinking about it and it suddenly occured to me what difference did it make what I wore at Buck's Ha, ha.
BETH: Ha, ha.
CALVIN: Just hear me out, Beth! It won't hurt you to listen!
BETH: I won't listen to that! No one in their right mind would listen to I just want to talk about something I always remembered.
CALVIN: I just want to talk about something I always remembered.
BETH: Why do you want to remind me of it?
CALVIN: Because I've always wondered, in some needling way, what it mattered what I wore. I was crazy that day. We were going to our son's funeral. And you were worried about what I wore on my feet. I'm sure it sounds like nothing to you, but it sticks with me and I just wanted to .tell you about it.
BETH: It's all right.
CAROLL: Beth! Beth! Hi! How are you?
BETH: Caroll! I'm fine. How are you?
CAROLL: I haven't seen you!

CALVIN: Darling, that is what this is for. Maybe you'll get a surprise.
BETH: I don't want any surprises. I know I'm not perfect. And if I can't go around hugging everybody all the time the way you do, then I'm sorry.
CALVIN: I am not asking you to be perfect, you're missing the point.
BETH: I don't want to see any doctors or counselors. I am me. This is my family. And if we have problems, then we will solve those problems in the privacy of our own home, not by running to some kind of specialist everytime something goes Are you folks ready to order?
