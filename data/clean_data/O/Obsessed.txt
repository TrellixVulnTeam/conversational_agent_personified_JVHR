ISA: Derek looks up from his paper with a distracted smile.
DEREK: Excuse me?
LISA: I couldn't help but notice we're both going to Seven.
DEREK: Right. Gage/Bendix. I work there.
LISA: I thought you might.
DEREK: Do you have an appointment with us?
LISA: Why? Do I look like a client?
DEREK: Actually, you do.
LISA: ( pleasant laugh )
W: ell, I hate to shatter the illusion but I'm just a lowly temp.
DEREK: ( genuinely surprised ) You're a temp?

DEREK: ( with humor ) Are you following me?
LISA: No. I'm taking these files to Mister Charles' office. They said it was this Derek Charles?
DEREK: Derek Charles?
LISA: I guess you probably know him.
DEREK: Oh, yeah, I know him. Kind of an asshole, takes himself waaaay too seriously. But don't tell him I said that. L
ISA: I could get you into trouble?
DEREK: Deep trouble.
ATRICK: Morning, Derek. How's the new house?
DEREK: Total chaos. Lucky for me, I sneaked out as soon as the movers showed up.
PATRICK: Beth must have loved that.
DEREK: If she calls mad and she will tell her I'm in a meeting.

AGE: You think he's right?
DEREK: Hell, no. I think he's a hundred percent wrong. We haven't even gotten close to that point yet. Hedge fund demand is coming from individual investors which is why it's gaining mainstream acceptance. You know Ganz. He gets paranoid when anything goes mainstream. He started making Auf Wiedersehen noises but I managed to talk him into a private equity portfolio instead. to the tune of 155 I knew there was a reason I promoted you. No offense, Ben.
AGE: ( PLEASED ) I knew there was a reason I promoted you. No offense, Ben.

GAGE: Remind me to call that agency and have them send over a couple more just like her. Doesn't hurt to have a little eye candy around the office, does it, boys?
BEN: I scored an extra Lakers ticket for tomorrow night. Think you can get free?
DEREK: I'm moving into a new house.

LISA: Good night, Mister Charles.
DEREK: ( LAUGHS ) Sorry but you set me up.

DEREK: But I've saved the most important toast for last. To my beautiful wife who I love and adore more than anything in the world.
BETH: And to my handsome husband. I asked for the moon and he gave me the stars.

EREK: Is it that time already?
LISA: Why don't they invite spouses?
DEREK: How's that?
LISA: To the Christmas party. It says "for employees only."
DEREK: It's like that in most companies. They think people are more inhibited in front of their spouses, less likely to kick back and enjoy themselves and mingle with co-workers, which is what the party is So, does this party get pretty wild?
LISA: So, does this party get pretty wild?
DEREK: Just the opposite.
LISA: Well that's no fun.

A: s Beth chats on, Derek gets a weird feeling. Still on the phone, he slowly gets up from his desk and moves quietly to the door. He looks out, expecting to catch Lisa listening in. Instead, she's not at her desk. She's standing several feet away at a file cabinet. She turns and smiles at him.
LISA: Do you need me?
