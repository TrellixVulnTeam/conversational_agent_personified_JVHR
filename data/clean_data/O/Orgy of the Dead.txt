CRISWELL: I am Criswell! For years I have told the almost unbelievable, related the unreal, and shown it to be more.than a fact. Now I tell a tale of the threshold, people, so astounding that some of you may faint.

SHIRLEY: We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery. Let's turn No. It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
BOB: No. It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
SHIRLEY: But does it have to be in a You wouldn't understand. Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
BOB: You wouldn't understand. Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
SHIRLEY: But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
BOB: Sure there areand I've tried them all. Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories. Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about
SHIRLEY: ( interrupting ) But horror stories! Why all the time horror stories?
BOB: Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word. Bob lets go of the wheel with his right arm and puts it around Shirley, who leans closer against him.
BOB: My monsters have done well for me. You think I'd give that up just so I could write about trees, or dogs, or daisies? HuhuhDaisies! That's it, I'll write about my creatures who are pushing up the daisies. Shirley looks up at Bob and smiles. He tilts his head down and they kiss.
BOB: Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
SHIRLEY: That's life. My kisses are Who's to say my monsters aren't alive? LONG SHOT of the car driving down the road CUT back to MEDIUM SHOT of Bob and Shirley
BOB: Who's to say my monsters aren't alive? LONG SHOT of the car driving down the road CUT back to MEDIUM SHOT of Bob and Shirley
BOB: All of my books are based on fact, or legend. Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
SHIRLEY: Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight. I can't see a thing! Let's turn back.
BOB: There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there LONG SHOT of car driving up a desert road with a sandy mountain in the background.
SHIRLEY: I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
BOB: ( reluctantly ) Bob takes his arm from around Shirley and puts it back on the Just as soon as I find a place wide enough to turn CLOSEUP of CAR INTERIOR - DASHBOARD. CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley
BOB: Just as soon as I find a place wide enough to turn CLOSEUP of CAR INTERIOR - DASHBOARD. CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley
SHIRLEY: Not so fast! We hear sounds of tires squealing on the road. CLOSEUP of car wheel racing along the road. CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley
SHIRLEY: ( desperately ) Not so fast! CLOSEUP - CAR PEDALS. Bob steps hard on the brake, then pumps the brake repeatedly. CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley. Shirley screams and hides her face with her hands. ZOOM IN on a high dirt bank at the roadside, then the screen swirls and spins quickly to suggest a dizzying automobile DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT Bob and Shirley are lying on their backs, unconcsious, on the ground. The ground is covered by scattered leaves. Misty fog swirls over them. ( beat ) Shirley wakes up and sits upright groggily. She looks around, then looks down at Bob. She moves toward him and cradles his head in her lap.
CRISWELL: The day is gone, the night is upon us, and the moon, which controls all of the underworld, once again shines.in radiant Come forth, come forth, o Princess of Darkness. Criswell repeatedly beckons slowly toward himself with his right hand, staring across the clearing at the mausoleum. The PRINCESS OF DARKNESS is standing in front of the Mausoleum. She walks into the clearing with an entrancing demeanor, her arms outstretched straight in front of her. She is wearing a long black low-cut dress with long open sleeves. The sleeves are lined with red and hang down a couple feet from her wrists. She walks slowly over toward Criswell's throne. The Princess of Darkness stands beside Criswells throne, crosses her forearms in front of her chest, and bows toward him. He nods toward her. She reaches out and places her left hand on Criswell's right hand.
CRISWELL: If I am not pleased by tonight's entertainment, I shall banish their souls to everlasting The Princess of Darkness again crosses her arms in front of her chest and slowly bows to Criswell. CUT TO shot of the FULL MOON with dramatic cymbals crashing, then back.
CRISWELL: And who is to be first? The Princess of Darkness claps twice, summoning the first of the night's entertainers. These poor souls must dance for Criswell's approval. If he is pleased, they can continue to entertain him for centuries, but if not, they will be banished to everlasting damnation by the All-powerful Criswell. LONG SHOT OF THE CLEARING. Huge flames rise from the ground in front of the clearing. The INDIAN GIRL enters the clearing and begins to Dance. She is wearing a red Native American- style dress and headband.
SHIRLEY: I'm so frightened.
BOB: Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
SHIRLEY: In there.
BOB: In there.
SHIRLEY: It frightens me.
BOB: Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
SHIRLEY: Then..then what's that music?
BOB: That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
SHIRLEY: What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of Something's making that music.
BOB: Something's making that music.
SHIRLEY: I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
BOB: All right. Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
SHIRLEY: What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
BOB: Not dead? In a cemetery?
SHIRLEY: I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
BOB: Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find. They'll have a telephone. C'mon.
SHIRLEY: Could it be some kind of college initiation?
BOB: It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them. Nothing alive looks like that!
SHIRLEY: Can't we get out of here?
BOB: I'm not sure.
SHIRLEY: What do you mean?
BOB: I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash.Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this! The Street Walker dances with a Skeleton that is hanging by the door of the mausoleum. The Street Walker dance ends.
CRISWELL: I would see for approval, the one who in life worshipped gold above all else. The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the mausoleum again to start off the next dance. The giants walk to the doors, now wearing red and white horizontal-striped miniskirts ( or ancient egyptian garb? ). They pull the iron doors open slowly, and we see the GOLD GIRL DANCER lying on her back on the altar inside.
SHIRLEY: ( pointing toward the mausoleum ) Be careful!They'll see you. The Gold Girl Dancer rises slowly and seductively from the table, then stalkingly dances out into the clearing. She is wearing a metallic gold tunic-like dress. We see a shot of Bob and Shirley watching, and suddenly the Gold Girl's dress has disappeared. The Gold Girl Dance continues.

We see a shot of Bob and Shirley watching, and suddenly the Gold Girl's dress has disappeared. The Gold Girl Dance continues.
CRISWELL: Throw gold at her.
CRISWELL: More gold.
CRISWELL: ( excitedly ) More gold! The giants continue, to the delight of Criswell. The Gold girl tries to scoop all the scattered coins closer to her.
CRISWELL: ( impatiently ) More gold! The giants continue. Criswell is thrilled, and begins to LAUGH loudly.
CRISWELL: ( to the Princess ) For all eternity, she shall have gold. The Princess of Darkness laughs in acknowledgement, then claps her hands twice, commanding the Giants to finish the The Giants walk toward the Gold Girl, who is still on the ground playing with the gold coins and rubbing them on her body. The giants pick up the Gold Girl, who resists, trying to maintain contact with the gold. She reaches for it as they lift her up.
CRISWELL: Bring 'em in! The Princess of Darkness stands and walks to the end of the altar below Criswell's throne, then sits on the lower seat at the end of the altar and crosses her legs. The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and Shirley over to the center of the clearing to face Criswell, The Sole Ruler of the Dark World.
CRISWELL: They are live ones?
THE MUMMY: ( with audible tape hiss added ) Yes, Master.
CRISWELL: Live ones where only the dead should be?
THE MUMMY: Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
WWWWOOOOOOAAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHAHAAAA!!!: You shall both be rewarded. My Dear Empress of the Night, put these intruders to the Medium Shot of Princess of Darkness. ( Suddenly the Princess of Darkness is beside the throne again, several feet from the seat at the foot of the altar )
CRISWELL: You shall both be rewarded. My Dear Empress of the Night, put these intruders to the Medium Shot of Princess of Darkness. ( Suddenly the Princess of Darkness is beside the throne again, several feet from the seat at the foot of the altar )
CRISWELL: ( happily ) A situation easily remedied.
SHIRLEY: ( desperately, to Criswell ) Fiend! Fiend!
CRISWELL: ( jovially ) A pussycat is born to be The Cat Girl Dance ends.
CRISWELL: ( excitedly ) It will please me very much to see the Slave Girl with her tortures! CUT TO interior of the stone mausoleum. The Ancient Egyptian SLAVE GIRL is chained from her wrists to a high hook on the wall. One of the "giants" pretends to whip her with a cat o' nine tails. CUT back to CRISWELL.
CRISWELL: ( excitedly ) Torture! Torture! It pleasures me! The slave girl pulls with all her might and the chains suddenly pop off the hook. She then pushes the iron doors open and dances out into the clearing. The Slave Dance concludes.
SHIRLEY: I'm so frightened.
BOB: You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of Those creatures..!
SHIRLEY: Those creatures..!
BOB: Don't let them hear you.
SHIRLEY: What can we do?
BOB: I don't know. I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet. Shirley closes her eyes and sighs.
BOB: Easy Shirley, Easy! Panic won't do us any good! Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
SHIRLEY: I'm afraid I'll faint.
BOB: Whatever you do, don't do The Camera zooms back and we see that the Wolf Man and The Mummy are hiding behind Bob and Shirley. The Wolf Man has his hand up to his ear so he can hear what Bob and Shirley are saying. The Wolf Man and The Mummy then creep over toward Criswell's The Wolf Man whispers into The Princess of Darkness's ear while The Mummy and Criswell watch. The Princess of Darkness gets up from the throne and walks over to Shirley. Shirley grimaces. The Princess of Darkness unbuttons Shirley's blouse, then marks Shirley's abdomen with a red ( blood? ) cross using her long sharp fingernail. Shirley screams. The Princess of Darkness pulls her long dagger out of her belt and raises it, staring into Shirley's eyes. Suddenly, Criswell The Princess of Darkness pauses and looks back at Criswell.
CRISWELL: The Princess of Darkness pauses and looks back at Criswell.
HOLD!: The Princess of Darkness pauses and looks back at Criswell.
CRISWELL: Let her continue to learn. The time is not yet right that they should join with The Princess of Darkness reluctantly puts her dagger back in her belt and tucks Shirley's blouse back in. The Princess of Darkness walks back to Criswell's throne. He pulls a human skull out from behind his seat.
CRISWELL: .And what is this?
CRISWELL: What kind of symbol?
CRISWELL: She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
CRISWELL: Her dance has pleased me. The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers, starting the
CRISWELL: She was?
CRISWELL: Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
THE MUMMY: I don't like snakes. I remember the one Cleopatra used. Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs. You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
THE MUMMY: Hurt her? Hell, it killed her!
THE MUMMY: We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt.slimy, slinky When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
THE MUMMY: When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
CRISWELL: She pleases me. Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes.
CRISWELL: ( continuing, after finding his place on the next cue card )
THE MUMMY: He wants us.
THE MUMMY: What do you suppose for?
THE MUMMY: Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
THE MUMMY: Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
THE MUMMY: I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
COME!: THE MUMMY We better go before we make him mad. The Wolf Man and The Mummy walk over to Criswell's Throne.
THE MUMMY: We better go before we make him mad. The Wolf Man and The Mummy walk over to Criswell's Throne.
THE MUMMY: ( apprehensively ) We are your servants, Master. The Wolf Man bows to Criswell.
CRISWELL: Of course you are. The Wolf Man and the Mummy crouch in fear as they face Criswell.
THE MUMMY: Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
CRISWELL: You know better than that.
THE MUMMY: We don't know of anything, Then why do you shake so?
CRISWELL: Then why do you shake so?
THE MUMMY: It's not often an Emperor like you calls on creatures like us.
CRISWELL: Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
THE MUMMY: ( relieved ) The Mummy Sighs in relief and the Wolf Man nods.
THE MUMMY: Then it is some service you desire of us.
CRISWELL: You are the keepers of the Damned. You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want.a decided change.
CRISWELL: Yes, yes yes I know all that.
CRISWELL: I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
CRISWELL: Ahh, but I declare there is still time for something.
THE MUMMY: There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
CRISWELL: Ahh, good. Then I will see them. Dismiss the rest.
THE MUMMY: Yes, sir, Master. Bob's hands are wiggling, trying to loosen the rope binding his wrists behind his back around the stone column.
BOB: The ropes are coming loose.
SHIRLEY: Be careful!
BOB: I amIt's our only chance.
SHIRLEY: Nothing is worth your life.
BOB: My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
SHIRLEY: I'm frightened. I'm so Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
BOB: Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
SHIRLEY: Be careful, oh please be careful. We'll never get out of here alive, I know it. I just feel it.
BOB: You do?
SHIRLEY: Yes I feel it in my bones.
BOB: You're talking nonsense.
SHIRLEY: Oh, no I'm not. These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
BOB: They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave
SHIRLEY: I should hope not. I hate you!
BOB: That sudden?
SHIRLEY: Yes, that sudden. If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this. It's all your fault.
BOB: ( dejected ) .And I thought you loved me.
CRISWELL: Not yet. I perhaps have other plans for such a pretty one. No matter, I will tell you when and if you may have her. The Princess of Darkness crosses her forearms and bows to The Wolf Man informs me that the next one is the woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night. Now she dances with his skeleton.
CRISWELL: ( to Shirley ) Have you not enjoyed the evening's festivities?
CRISWELL: Ahh, that will soon change when you become one of us! The Wolf Man leans back and howls. ( He tilts his head back so far his fake rubber wolfman mask comes up and you can see his skin at the bottom of his neck )
CRISWELL: It would seem that The Wolf Man would have you for his own!
SHIRLEY: I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward. It could be that
CRISWELL: I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward. It could be that
SHIRLEY: You need not worry.Not just now, anyway.
CRISWELL: You need not worry.Not just now, anyway.
BOB: Leave her alone, you fiend!
CRISWELL: Fiend is it! You will not be so fortunate. Your existence will cease within moments. No one wishes to see a man dance. And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
BOB: If I could get my hands on ..Oh, You could do nothing! I can save you much pain.
CRISWELL: ..Oh, You could do nothing! I can save you much pain.
BOB: Leave her alone, I tell you!
CRISWELL: ( to Shirley ) I do not joke in my proposal.
CRISWELL: The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain. Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and No. No! No!
SHIRLEY: No. No! No!
CRISWELL: I repulse you? Very well. It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it! I should say die with it! Bob looks down somberly, then looks over at Shirley.
BOB: I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free. Be carefulDon't change your expression too much. They must not catch on.
SHIRLEY: What can we do against them?
BOB: I don't know, yet. We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to doI hope I'll know what to do.
SHIRLEY: I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
BOB: All right. Put it on heavy.
SHIRLEY: My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this. At least he's got brains.
BOB: with all the lights on.
SHIRLEY: Maybe so. CUT TO shot of The Mummy talking to The Wolf Man
THE MUMMY: I could make her another Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
THE MUMMY: Without the snake, of Ahh, she will be yours.
CRISWELL: Ahh, she will be yours.
CRISWELL: At your discretion.But first, I desire more The moon is almost gone!
CRISWELL: Ahh, there is yet time.
CRISWELL: ( getting annoyed ) I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
CRISWELL: ( angrily ) Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World. There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the lawall powerful.
CRISWELL: Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair. Now are there others?
CRISWELL: Well then let us proceed.
BOB: Easy, Shirley. Easy! The Zombie Dance concludes.
CRISWELL: I will decide the conclusion.
CRISWELL: ( interrupting ) Then cancel my order.
CRISWELL: There is yet time. Don't you want your own pleasure?
CRISWELL: Hahh, there is always time. All in good time.there is
CRISWELL: The time.is short.
CRISWELL: Your pleasures of course!
CRISWELL: You may take her now.
CRISWELL: You better hope there is.
CRISWELL: Now hurry, hurry. I will watch! Your desires may be my pleasure also.Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment. You must.hurry The Princess of Darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with her long sacrificial dagger, slowly moving toward shirley, gazing back at Criswell seductively. She finally gets to Shirley and cuts the button off of Shirley's shirt, which was so tight it was about to burst open anyway. She unsnaps the front of Shirley's bra.
DOCTOR #1: Easy, Miss, everything's gonna be alright.
SHIRLEY: Bob? Bob?
DOCTOR #1: He's right here beside you. He'll be alright too. The reporter walks around and crouches beside Shirley and DOCTOR #1, and continues writing in his pad. A Newspaper PHOTOGRAPHER crouches in the foreground to get a shot of the accident scene and victims.
SHIRLEY: Where are they, where did they go? They tried to kill What's this you say? Who was going to kill you?
DOCTOR #2: What's this you say? Who was going to kill you?
SHIRLEY: The ghoulsthey all turned into skeletons.
DOCTOR #2: Take it easy, Miss.
DOCTOR #1: What she needs is a good It's true, I tell you, it's true! They all turned into skeletons. She-she cut me Shirley points to her abdomen where The Princess of Darkness had made the X with her fingernail.
SHIRLEY: It's true, I tell you, it's true! They all turned into skeletons. She-she cut me Shirley points to her abdomen where The Princess of Darkness had made the X with her fingernail.
DOCTOR #1: Probably was bruised in the You know, you two were very I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
DOCTOR #2: You know, you two were very I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
SHIRLEY: I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
BOB: There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
SHIRLEY: You love me then?
BOB: Of course I do. The doctors put Shirley onto a stretcher while the photographer takes more pictures. They put her into the back of an Then after the doctor listens to Bob's neck with a stethoscope, Bob just gets up and walks into the back of the ambulance.
CRISWELL: Yes, they were lucky, those two young people.May you be so lucky.But do not trust to luck, at the full of the moon, when the night is dark.Make a wide path around the unholy grounds.of the Night People. Who can say that we do not exist-Can you?
