GREGORY: A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the wall of any man or maid of Capulets.
SAMPSON: That shows thee a weak slave. For the weakest goes to the wall.
GREGORY: 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore, I will push Capulet's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the Benvolio, disgusted, gets out of the car.
BENVOLIO: The quarrel is between our masters.

MONTAGUE: What noise is this!
CAROLINE: Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe!
MONTAGUE: ( shrugging her off ) Hold me not, let me go!
TYBALT: Look upon thy death, Benvolio.
CAPTAIN PRINCE: ( over PA ) Rebellious subjects, enemies to Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground.
CAPTAIN PRINCE: Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground!
VOICE OVER: Two households, both alike in In fair Verona, where we lay our
SCENE: From ancient grudge break to new Where civil blood makes civil hands From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star crossed lovers take their life. Whose misadventured piteous
OVERTHROWS: Doth with their death bury their parents strife.
CAPTAIN PRINCE: Three civil brawls, bred of an airy
WORD: By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets.
LAWYER: My noble Prince I can.
CAPTAIN PRINCE: If ever you disturb our streets Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
CAROLINE: O where is Romeo? Saw you him ( pointedly to Montague ) Right glad I am he was not at this Montague snorts derisively and stares out the window. Embarrassed, Benvolio tries to be of assistance.
BENVOLIO: Madam, underneath The Grove of

MONTAGUE: Many a morning hath he there been
SEEN: With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew.
CAROLINE: Away from light steals home my heavy son And private in his chamber pens Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out And makes himself an artificial Montague barks into the car intercom.
MONTAGUE: Westward from this city side.
MONTAGUE: Black and portentous must this humour prove Unless good counsel may the cause EXT. BEACH. DAWN. P.O.V.: From the limousine. Romeo rises and listlessly makes his way up the beach - seeing his father's car he turns and heads for the path that hugs the beach front.

BENVOLIO: What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
ROMEO: Not having that which having makes them short.
BENVOLIO: In love?
ROMEO: Of love?
BENVOLIO: Of love?
ROMEO: Out of her favor where I am in love.
BENVOLIO: Alas that love, so gentle in his Should be so tyrannical and rough in proof!

BENVOLIO: I aimed so near when I supposed you Romeo leans against the car.
ROMEO: A right good marksman; and she's fair I love.
BENVOLIO: ( he is impressed ) A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
ROMEO: She'll not be hit with Cupid's She hath Dian's wit, And in strong proof of chastity lives well armed.
BENVOLIO: Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

WORLD;: Let two more summers wither in their pride, Ere we may think her ripe to be a Dave is politely insistent.
DAVE: Younger than she are happy mothers ( checking him hard ) And too soon marred are those so early made. Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she; She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
CAPULET: ( checking him hard ) And too soon marred are those so early made. Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she; She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
CHOICE: Lies my consent and fair according This night I hold an old Accustomed Capulet leans close.
BENVOLIO: ( chalking his cue ) Take thou some new infection to thy He lines up the six ball top pocket.
BENVOLIO: Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
ROMEO: Not mad, but bound more than a madman is; Shut up in prison, kept without my Romeo stalks away from the table.

GLORIA: Verona's summer hath not such a Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
NURSE: Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
GLORIA: This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face And find delight writ there with beauty's pen.

MERCUTIO: Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you Romeo pushes Mercutio away.
ROMEO: Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes With nimble soles. I have a soul of lead.
MERCUTIO: Too great oppression for a tender Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
ROMEO: Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
MERCUTIO: If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
ROMEO: Under love's heavy burden do I sink!
BENVOLIO: Every man betake him to his legs!
MERCUTIO: Come, we burn daylight, ho!
ROMEO: But 'tis no wit to go.

STONE: On the forefinger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep.
ROMEO: Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace. Thou talkest of nothing.
MERCUTIO: True, I talk of dreams; Which are the children of an idle Begot of nothing but vain fantasy. Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the
NORTH: And, being angered, puffs away from

BENVOLIO: This wind you talk of blows us from
ROMEO: I fear, too early, for my mind
MISGIVES: Some consequence yet hanging in the
STARS: Shall bitterly begin his fearful

CAPULET: Ah, I have seen the day that I
COULD: Tell a whispering tale in a fair ladies ear. Such as would please.
NURSE: Juliet, your mother calls.
DAVE: Will you now deny to dance?
GLORIA: ( whispering to Juliet ) A man, young lady, such a man.
TYBALT: What, dares the slave come hither to fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now by the stock and honor of my
KIN: To strike him dead I hold it not a Tybalt moves off aggressively, but is halted as Capulet slams a hand into his chest.
CAPULET: Why how now kinsman, wherefore storm you so?
TYBALT: Uncle, this is that villain Romeo. A Montague, our foe.
CAPULET: Young Romeo is it?
TYBALT: 'Tis he.
CAPULET: Content thee gentle coz, let him I would not for the wealth of all this town Here in my house do him Therefore be patient; take no note of him.
TYBALT: I'll not endure him.
CAPULET: He shall be endured! ( slapping Tybalt viciously ) What, goodman boy! I say he shall! Go to.
CAPULET: You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
CAPULET: What? Cheerly my hearts!
CAPULET: You'll not endure him! Am I the master here or you? Go to.
ROMEO: Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight. For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
ROMEO: If I profane with my unworthiest
HAND: This holy shrine, the gentle sin is My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
JULIET: Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in For saints have hands that pilgrim's hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
ROMEO: Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
JULIET: ( a gentle scolding ) Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
ROMEO: O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do, They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
JULIET: Saints do not move, though grant for prayer's sake.
ROMEO: Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
JULIET: Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
ROMEO: Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
JULIET: You kiss by th' book.
NURSE: Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
ROMEO: ( under his breath ) Is she a Capulet?
NURSE: His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy.
MERCUTIO: Away, begone, the sport is at its Mercutio shuttles Romeo toward the door.
ROMEO: Ay so I fear,
JULIET: My only love, sprung from my only Too early seen unknown, and known too late. Prodigious birth of love it is to me
TYBALT: I will withdraw. But this intrusion Now seeming sweet, convert to bitterest gall.
BOYS: "I am a pretty piece of flesh, I am a pretty piece of flesh."
ROMEO: Can I go forward when my heart is Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
BENVOLIO: Romeo! Cousin Romeo! Romeo!
BENVOLIO: He ran this way. Call, good Nay, I'll conjure too.
MERCUTIO: Nay, I'll conjure too.
MERCUTIO: Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh. And the demesnes that there adjacent That in thy likeness thou appear to EXT. CAPULET WALL. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: Romeo's fake chain mail shirt tangled in the barbed wire at the top of the wall.
ROMEO: He jests at scars that never felt a Romeo moves off through the darkened grounds of Capulet EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT. The boys laugh hysterically as Mercutio staggers around the bridge in imitation of a love sick fool.
MERCUTIO: O Romeo, that she were, O that she
WERE: An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!
ROMEO: But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
ROMEO: It is the East, and Juliet is the Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with
GRIEF: That thou her maid art far more fair than she. Be not her maid, since she is Her vestal livery is but sick and And none but fools do wear it. Juliet stands on the top step of the pool stairs. She is directly below Romeo as he whispers.
JULIET: Ay me!
ROMEO: ( WHISPERS ) She speaks. O, speak again, bright angel!
JULIET: O Romeo, Romeo! - Whyfore art thou Deny thy father and refuse thy Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
ROMEO: Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
JULIET: 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou are thyself, though not a What's Montague? It is not hand nor foot Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as So Romeo would, were he not Romeo Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, And for thy name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself.
ROMEO: I take thee at thy word! Call me but love, and I'll be new Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
JULIET: What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel?
ROMEO: By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to
MYSELF: Because it is an enemy to thee. The ferocious barking of a guard dog arrests the teenagers attention. A moment, then they slide beneath the water.
JULIET: Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
ROMEO: Neither, fair maid, if either thee Juliet looks nervously toward the house. She drags Romeo toward a small grotto at the end of the pool.
JULIET: How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and whyfore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art.
ROMEO: ( with splashy bravado ) With love's light wings did I o'er perch these walls. For stony limits cannot hold love And what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
JULIET: ( a real fear ) If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
ROMEO: I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes. And but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their
HATE: Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
JULIET: Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek, For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form - fain, fain deny What I have spoke. But farewell Dost thou love me?
ROMEO: Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow, That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops -
JULIET: O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled Lest that thy love prove likewise What shall I swear by?
ROMEO: What shall I swear by?
JULIET: Do not swear at all. Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
ROMEO: If my heart's dear love -
JULIET: Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract It is too rash, too unadvised, too
SUDDEN;: Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'it lightens.' Sweet, good night. This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my She rushes up the stairs - Romeo follows desperately.
ROMEO: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
JULIET: What satisfaction canst thou have CLOSE ON: Romeo.
ROMEO: The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
JULIET: I gave thee mind before thou didst request it!
ROMEO: Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose love?
JULIET: But to be frank and give it thee They kiss again. The Nurse calls from inside.
JULIET: ( BREATHLESSLY ) Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be Thy purpose marriage, send me word By one that I'll procure to come to Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite, And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
JULIET: I come, anon - But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee.
JULIET: ( to Nurse ) By and by I come! To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. Tomorrow will I send.
ROMEO: So thrive my soul.
JULIET: A thousand times good night!
ROMEO: A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books; But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
JULIET: Romeo! What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee?
ROMEO: By the hour of nine.
JULIET: I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year till then. Goodnight, goodnight! Parting is such sweet sorrow. That I shall say goodnight till it be morrow.
ROMEO: Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast, Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.
LIES: In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.
FLOWER: Poison hath residence, and medicine PULL BACK: The Priest carefully gathers the sap into a beaker. We discover that we are in a small tropical FATHER LAURENCE ( CONT. ) ( to the boys ) For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart. The boys follow the Father as he moves out of the greenhouse and into an adjoining work area. The walls are lined with bottles of herbs and dried plants and a television flickers in the corner.
FATHER LAURENCE: Two such opposed kings encamp them
STILL: In man as well as herbs: grace and rude will; And where the worser is predominant, Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
ROMEO: Good morrow, father!
FATHER LAURENCE: What early tongue so sweet saluteth Without pausing, the priest continues through the courtyard and toward the church.
HEAD: So soon to bid good morrow to thy Or if not so, then here I hit it right - Our Romeo hath not been in bed The priest enters the back of the church.
ROMEO: The last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.
FATHER LAURENCE: ( he stops ) God pardon sin! Wast thou with With Rosaline, my ghostly father? I have forgot that name and that name's woe.
ROMEO: With Rosaline, my ghostly father? I have forgot that name and that name's woe.
FATHER LAURENCE: That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
ROMEO: I have been feasting with mine Where on a sudden one hath wounded That's by me wounded. Both our
REMEDIES: Within they help and holy physic FATHER LAURENCE ( buttoning a long black cassock ) Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift. Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
FATHER LAURENCE: ( buttoning a long black cassock ) Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift. Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
ROMEO: Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set, On the fair daughter of rich We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow, I'll tell thee as we pass. But this I pray, That thou consent to marry us today.
ALTAR BOYS: Good morrow, Romeo.
FATHER LAURENCE: Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here! Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, So soon foresaken? Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
ROMEO: Thou chid'st me oft for loving FATHER LAURENCE ( very angry ) For doting, not for loving, pupil I pray thee chide me not. Her I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow. The other did not so.
FATHER LAURENCE: ( very angry ) For doting, not for loving, pupil I pray thee chide me not. Her I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow. The other did not so.
ROMEO: I pray thee chide me not. Her I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow. The other did not so.
FATHER LAURENCE: O, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
CHOIR: How can you just leave me standing Alone in a world so cold, Maybe I'm just too demanding, Maybe I'm just like my father, too Maybe you're just like my mother, She's never satisfied. Why do we scream at each other? This is what it sounds like when doves cry.
FATHER LAURENCE: But come, young waverer, come, go with me. In one respect I'll thy assistant For this alliance may so happy
PROVE: To turn your households' rancor to pure love.
ROMEO: O, let us hence! I stand on sudden Father Laurence holds Romeo in his powerful gaze.
FATHER LAURENCE: Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.
MERCUTIO: Where the devil should this Romeo Came he not home tonight?
BENVOLIO: ( slamming down the phone ) Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
MERCUTIO: Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
BENVOLIO: ( running to keep up ) Tybalt hath sent a letter to his father's house.
MERCUTIO: ( halts abruptly ) A challenge, on my life.
BENVOLIO: Romeo will answer it?
MERCUTIO: Any man that can write may answer a Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
BENVOLIO: Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
MERCUTIO: Alas, poor Romeo, he is already Stabbed with a white wench's black He whispers into Benvolio's ear:
BENVOLIO: ( struggling to break free ) Why, what is Tybalt?
MERCUTIO: ( releasing him ) More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the courageous captain of The very butcher of a silk button.
BENVOLIO: Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!
MERCUTIO: Signor Romeo, Bonjour. There's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
ROMEO: Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
MERCUTIO: The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
ROMEO: Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
MERCUTIO: ( SARCASTICALLY ) A most courteous exposition.
ROMEO: Nay I am the very pink of courtesy.
MERCUTIO: ( CAMPLY ) Pink for flower?
ROMEO: I will bite thee on the ear for that jest!
MERCUTIO: Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.
ROMEO: Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I'll cry a match.
MERCUTIO: Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
ROMEO: Here's goodly gear.
MERCUTIO: ( BEMUSED ) God ye good e'en fair gentlewoman.
NURSE: I desire some confidence with you.

MERCUTIO: ( taken by surprise ) Romeo, will you come to your We'll to dinner thither.
ROMEO: ( as he closes the door ) I will follow you.
MERCUTIO: Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell.
NURSE: If ye should lead her in a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing and very weak dealing.
ROMEO: Bid her to come to confession this And there she shall at Friar Laurence's cell Be shrived and ( PUSH IN ON: Romeo ) INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAY. CLOSE ON: Juliet's face peering out her bedroom window.

NURSE: Then hie you hence to Father Laurence cell. There stays a husband to make you a Juliet, with a scream of joy, hugs the Nurse to her.
FATHER LAURENCE: These violent delights have violent PULL BACK: Father Laurence is preaching energetically from the pulpit. Hidden from the congregation, Romeo waits in a small alcove chapel at the side of the altar.
JULIET: Good afternoon to my ghostly But before the priest can reply, the two lovers embrace, kissing passionately.
FATHER LAURENCE: ( DRYLY ) Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
BENVOLIO: I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's The day is hot,
MERCUTIO: Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says 'God send me no need of thee!' ( he hands Benvolio his gun ) and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
BENVOLIO: By my head, here comes the Capulets.
MERCUTIO: By my heel, I care not.
TYBALT: Gentlemen, good day. A word with one of you.
MERCUTIO: And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a.
TYBALT: ( FURIOUS ) You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, ( clutching at his side arm ) And you will give me occasion.
MERCUTIO: ( a breathy, coquettish
VOICE ): Could you not take some occasion without giving?
TYBALT: Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
MERCUTIO: Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my fiddlestick.
BENVOLIO: Either withdraw unto some private Or reason coldly of your grievances. Here all eyes gaze on us.
MERCUTIO: Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
TYBALT: Well sir, here comes my man.
TYBALT: Romeo, the love I bear thee can
AFFORD: No better term than this:
ROMEO: Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining
RAGE: To such a greeting: villain am I Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
TYBALT: Boy, this shall not excuse the
INJURIES: That thou hast done me!
TYBALT: ( YELLING ) Turn and draw.
ROMEO: I never injured thee, And so, good Capulet, which name I
TENDER: As dearly as mine own.
MERCUTIO: O calm, dishonourable, vile EXT. BEACH - VACANT LOT. DAY. Tybalt's anger must be answered. He ceremoniously disarms, gives his weapon to Abra, and sprints after Romeo who is now passing a beach side lot that houses an abandoned grand hotel. A bone-cracking kick sends Romeo crumbling into the vacant lot. The boys swarm toward the fray. Romeo, still refusing the fight, scrambles up the stairs of the deserted hotel. Tybalt trips him and Romeo careens into an ornamental wooden railing, smashing it to pieces.
TYBALT: What wouldst thou have with me?
MERCUTIO: ( AVOIDING ) Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
TYBALT: I am for you.
ROMEO: Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio!
ABRA: Away Tybalt!
BENVOLIO: Art thou hurt?
MERCUTIO: Ay, ay, a scratch.
ROMEO: Courage, man. The hurt cannot be Mercutio holding his bleeding side, jokes through the pain.
MERCUTIO: 'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man.
ROMEO: I thought all for the best.
MERCUTIO: A plague o' both your houses! They have made worms' meat of me.
BENVOLIO: Mercutio is dead!
ROMEO: Oh sweet Juliet, Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper softened valor's The sound of Tybalt's vehicle starting brings back cold reality. Romeo's sorrow turns to uncontrollable rage.
ROMEO: Mercutio's soul Is but a little way above our heads,
TYBALT: Thou, wretched boy, shalt with him Romeo, refusing to let go of the gun, forces Tybalt backward through the torrential rain.
ROMEO: ( with frightening intensity ) Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
COP: ( Romeo in his sights ) Put up thy weapon.
ROMEO: O, I am fortune's fool!
BALTHASAR: Romeo, away be gone! Stand not Romeo collapses into the front seat.
GLORIA: Cops nervously eye Fulgencio Capulet and Ted Montague, who, both flanked by body guards, face each other across the crime scene. Medics stand by helplessly as Gloria clings to Tybalt's body. A handcuffed Benvolio looks on.
CAPTAIN PRINCE: Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
BENVOLIO: O noble Prince I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal Gloria appeals hysterically:
GLORIA: Prince as thou art true, For blood of ours shed blood of CAPTAIN PRINCE Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
CAPTAIN PRINCE: Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
BENVOLIO: ( pointing to Tybalt's corpse ) There lies the man, slain by young That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio.
GLORIA: He speaks not true! Affection makes him false!
BENVOLIO: Romeo, that spoke him fair, could not take Truce with the unruly spleen of
TYBALT: Deaf to peace!
GLORIA: He is a kinsman to the Montague! I beg for justice which thou Prince must give. Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not Captain Prince turns to Gloria.
CAPTAIN PRINCE: Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio. Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
MONTAGUE: Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio's friend; His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt.
CAPTAIN PRINCE: And for that offence Immediately we do exile him.
MONTAGUE: Noble Prince.?
CAPTAIN PRINCE: I will be deaf to pleading and
EXCUSES;: Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses. Therefore use none.
JULIET: Come gentle night, coming loving black browed night, Give me my Romeo. And when I shall Take him and cut him out in little And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night, And pay no worship to the garish O, I have bought the mansion of a

NURSE: There's no trust, No faith, no honesty in men. All perjured, All forsworn, all naught, all Shame come to Romeo.
JULIET: Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish! He was not born to shame. Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit.
NURSE: Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?
JULIET: Shall I speak ill of him that is my Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name When I, thy three-hours wife have mangled it? But whyfore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? That villain cousin would have killed my husband. All this is comfort, wherefore weep I then? Some word there was worser than Tybalt's death: I would forget it fain - exiled. Tybalt is dead, and Romeo exiled. To speak that word is father, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all slain, All dead.
NURSE: Hie to your chamber. I'll find

ROMEO: She goes to him.
NURSE: Ah sir! Ah sir! Death's the end of all.
ROMEO: Speakest thou of Juliet? Where is she? And how doth she? And what says My concealed lady to our cancelled O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps, And then on Romeo cries, and then falls down again.
NURSE: O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps, And then on Romeo cries, and then falls down again.
ROMEO: As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a Did murder her, as that name's cursed hand murdered her kinsman!
FATHER LAURENCE: I thought thy disposition better Thy Juliet is alive, There art thou The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A pack of blessings light upon thy Romeo calms. The Nurse gives him the ring.
NURSE: Here sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
ROMEO: How well my comfort is revived by The priest goes to his wardrobe, removes a clean white shirt and helps Romeo put it on.
FATHER LAURENCE: Go, get thee to thy love, as was Ascend her chamber. Hence and comfort her. But look thou stay not till the Watch be set, For then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thou shalt live till we can find a time To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, Beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back, With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou wentst forth in Father Laurence ushers Romeo from the room.

ROMEO: The priest and Balthasar watch as Romeo and the Nurse sprint for the car.
GLORIA: She'll not come down tonight.
DAVE: These times of woe afford no times to woo.
CAPULET: Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly.
GLORIA: ( JOINING ) And so did I.
CAPULET: ( a cold glance at Gloria ) Well, we were born to die.
GLORIA: I'll know her mind early tomorrow. Tonight she's mewed up to her As Gloria, Dave and Capulet exit down the hallway we CRANE UP: toward Juliet's bedroom door.

JULIET: O, think'st thou we shall ever meet Romeo smiles up at her.
ROMEO: I doubt it not;
JULIET: O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
ROMEO: Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our times to come.
GLORIA: Ho daughter! Are you up?
GLORIA: Well, well.
ROMEO: Adieu, adieu!
JULIET: O Fortune, Fortune! Be fickle, Fo then I hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back.

GLORIA: Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself.
CAPULET: How now, wife? Have you delivered to her our decree?
GLORIA: Ay, sir. But she will none, she gives you thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave!
CAPULET: How? Will she none? Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest, Unworthy as she is, that we have
WROUGHT: So worthy a gentleman to be her Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. Proud can I never be of what I hate.
JULIET: Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. Proud can I never be of what I hate.

JULIET: Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
CAPULET: Speak not, reply not, do not answer He throws her to the floor. His fist thuds as it slams into her face.
GLORIA: ( SCREAMING ) Fie, fie! What are you mad?
CAPULET: Hang thee, young baggage! Disobedient wretch.
NURSE: God in heaven bless her! You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

BALTHASAR: Then she is well and nothing can be Her body sleeps in Capels' monument, And her immortal part with angels I saw her laid low in her kindred's For a long moment Romeo is profoundly still. When he speaks, it is with a chilling calm.

APOTHECARY: Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law Is death to any he that utters them.
ROMEO: The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law. Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
APOTHECARY: My poverty, but not my will consents.
ROMEO: I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
