RELIC: a screenplay by Amy Holden Jones
WHITTLESLEY: Whittlesley pulls out A KNIFE, puts it to the driver's jugular vein.
DRIVER: Whittlesley pulls out A KNIFE, puts it to the driver's jugular vein.
WHITTLESLEY: Sweat pouring down his brow, the driver re-doubles his speed.
WHITTLESLEY: Thank God.
WHITTLESLEY: Where is he?
WHITTLESLEY: to save your lives, you fools!
FRANCO: Yes. Thank Christ somebody speaks English. I'm Dr. John Whittlesley. You have some crates of mine on board. They were shipped by mistake to the Natural History Museum. We have to get them off the boat.
WHITTLESLEY: Yes. Thank Christ somebody speaks English. I'm Dr. John Whittlesley. You have some crates of mine on board. They were shipped by mistake to the Natural History Museum. We have to get them off the boat.
FRANCO: You have I.D.?
WHITTLESLEY: No. Let me explain. I was on an expedition for the museum on the Upper Xingu. Something horrible happened. I'm the only one who got out alive. I lost everything, my I.D., everything. I have to make sure no one else dies. The crates, the crates were sent out before we knew. There's something unspeakable inside. If your boat leaves harbor with those crates on board, I can't be responsible. My God, if they reach New York.
FRANCO: No! I'm not crazy! As God is my witness, I'm telling the truth.
WHITTLESLEY: No! I'm not crazy! As God is my witness, I'm telling the truth.
WHITTLESLEY: me. Your lives are in danger.
WHITTLESLEY: Cash. Cash, you see? American money.
WHITTLESLEY: Too late. He turns to run back on deck but then stops, sniffs the air. A look of desperation fills his eyes. With one hand he pulls out THE KNIFE, and unexpectedly puts it to HIS OWN NECK. Better to kill himself than face what comes next. The knife touches. A NECKLACE of TWO ARROWS, one gold, another silver. Whittlesley stares wide-eyed into the blackness of the hold. The goats start BLEATING in blind panic. A shaft of moonlight comes through a porthole as the boat turns. The moonlight falls on THE CRATES. Whittlesley's eyes lock onto them and he inches towards them, drawn inexorably closer. closer.
WHITTLESLEY: No. no.
PENDERGAST: ( unperturbed ) Any of your men go on board?
MRS. BEASLEY: Don't run, children! Stay with your partner and do not run! If anyone runs they will be sent back to the
MRS. BEASLEY: Henry! Larry! What did I just say! You walk right this minute! Did you hear me?!
GUARD: Morning, Dr. Green.
MARGO: Morning Joe. Beautiful day.
HENRY: You work here?
MARGO: Yes, I do.
HENRY: What do you do?
MARGO: ( leans down, amused ) I'm an Evolutionary Biologist. What do you do?
HENRY: Nothing. I'm in third grade. What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' Evolutionary Biologist. I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
MARGO: Evolutionary Biologist. I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
HENRY: ( brightens ) Way cool. Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
MARGO: Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
MARGO: Hello, Ian. Everything ready for the opening of the Superstition Exhibit?
CUTHBERT: I'm on my way to get the last piece out of storage right now.
MARGO: I'd wish you luck but I'm not You will be after tomorrow night.
CUTHBERT: You will be after tomorrow night.
CUTHBERT: What the. ?
CUTHBERT: No, it can't be.
CUTHBERT: Cuthbert rises, shakes his finger in pain. Blood drips on the floor. He pulls out his pocket handkerchief and wraps the wound. The handkerchief rapidly soaks through. Suddenly a HAND CLAMPS on Cuthbert's shoulder! He's not alone! He lets out a YELP, almost dropping the Relic and spins to see. A MUSEUM GUARD standing behind him. His nameplate reads. BEAUREGARD. He's a gentle young fellow with white blond hair and a rolling southern accent.
CUTHBERT: Beauregard! You scared me half to I'm sorry, sir. You okay?
BEAUREGARD: I'm sorry, sir. You okay?
CUTHBERT: Someone broke into this room.
BEAUREGARD: Anything missin'?
CUTHBERT: Doesn't look like it. We're damned lucky. This statue is priceless.
CUTHBERT: Mbwun. A South American warrior deity. He carries a powerful curse. Every member of the expedition that found this statue, died.
BEAUREGARD: Looks like the curse is still at The claws are sharp. I must have cut myself. Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be
CUTHBERT: The claws are sharp. I must have cut myself. Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be
BEAUREGARD: Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Why not?
CUTHBERT: Why not?
BEAUREGARD: No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out. That lock was torn off from the inside.
KAWAKITA: Third from the end! Right shoulder. Aleut, provenance unknown.
KAWAKITA: If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my But at what a price. I have the species identification on these teeth. We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program. Call Dr. Frock. He wanted a demonstration.
MARGO: ( small smile ) But at what a price. I have the species identification on these teeth. We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program. Call Dr. Frock. He wanted a demonstration.
MARGO: I have the species identification on these teeth. We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program. Call Dr. Frock. He wanted a demonstration.
KAWAKITA: Margo, you haven't heard?
MARGO: Frock's been fired.
KAWAKITA: Frock's been fired.
MARGO: That's impossible.
KAWAKITA: ( awkward ) I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me. Telegraph. Telephone. Tell Kawakita. I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary. This is Dr. Frock's last
DR. FROCK: Hello, Margo. Sorry about the mess.
MARGO: Is it true? Greg said you'd been Yes. Bit of a shock. But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood. And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era
FROCK: Yes. Bit of a shock. But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood. And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era
MARGO: I don't believe it.
FROCK: Now Margo, don't overreact. Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow. My leaving makes perfect sense. This isn't exactly early retirement. I've overstayed the party a bit.
MARGO: We can't do without you. You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology. You're practically an institution around That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news. Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants? Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
FROCK: That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news. Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants? Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
MARGO: "Phyletic Transformation and the Tertiary Fern Spike" is not going anywhere. I'll talk to Cuthbert and put a stop to this right now.
FROCK: Please. Don't humiliate me further.
MARGO: Let me help. I can take care of No, Margo. This is one problem you can't solve. You have to stay out of it. The fact is, I want to retire.
FROCK: No, Margo. This is one problem you can't solve. You have to stay out of it. The fact is, I want to retire.
MARGO: How can you say that? You know it's not true.
FROCK: Yes it is. I'm tired and I'm no longer needed
MARGO: My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
FROCK: With all due respect, dear, that's bull. You dance rings around me with your new technology. You've left me in the dust.
MARGO: ( stubbornly loyal ) Your work is highly relevant. What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology? Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
FROCK: Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
FROCK: Come on. I'll walk you back to the I'm not giving up.
MARGO: I'm not giving up.
FROCK: You must.
FROCK: This isn't a death sentence. Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing. I'll garden. I'll write.
MARGO: You are this museum. It won't be the same without you.
FROCK: Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years. That's quite
FROCK: I'll see you at lunch.
HENRY: Mrs. Beasley, it's almost time to go and we still haven't seen the If you ask me about the dinosaurs once more, I'II strangle you both!
BEASLEY: If you ask me about the dinosaurs once more, I'II strangle you both!
LARRY: ( whispers ) This room sucks.
HENRY: She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs. That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
LARRY: Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
LARRY: Look at this. A Komodo dragon.
HENRY: Check out this one. It can walk up
LARRY: We're not supposed to go back there.
HENRY: Chicken. This is a great short cut.
LARRY: I don't want to go this way.
HENRY: Don't be a wuss. Come on.
HENRY: Hey, there's a secret staircase back here. Cool.
LARRY: Henry, come back!
LARRY: Henry! Henry!
LARRY: No answer. Larry puts his first foot on the stair.
LARRY: Henry! Come up! Please!
LARRY: Henry? Where are you? Henry? Henry! Henry! It smells awful. Answer me! Are you all right?
LARRY: Henry! Henry! It smells awful. Answer me! Are you all right?
HENRY: What is it?
LARRY: What is it?
HENRY: I don't know. But I think it's bad.
COP: Worried, Margo hands it over.
MARGO: What's going on?
COP: All employees are to go to the IMAX room for a briefing, Dr. Green.
COP ONE: What was that? Six?
COP TWO: Lost count.
PENDERGAST: Could you please take me to the officer in charge?
D'AGOSTA: Don't touch anything until the S.O.C. has finished with those stairs. Keep everyone clear of the perimeter. I don't want any contamination. There's an incredible amount of blood evidence down here. We need more light. Where's the photographer? Tell him to quit eating donuts, I need him.
D'AGOSTA: Who are you? The undertaker?
PENDERGAST: Special Agent Pendergast. FBI.
D'AGOSTA: Vince D'Agosta. Am I out?
PENDERGAST: Not at all. I think we may be working on the same case. If so, I could use your help.
PENDERGAST: The body?
D'AGOSTA: What's left of it.
PENDERGAST: Mind if I have a look?
D'AGOSTA: We need light in here, stat.
PENDERGAST: Where's the head? Careful. That mess on the ground is Whose footprints?
D'AGOSTA: Careful. That mess on the ground is Whose footprints?
PENDERGAST: Whose footprints?
D'AGOSTA: Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man. Been tossing his cookies for over an hour. Not a likely suspect.
D'AGOSTA: Pendergast looks down, utterly impassive.
PENDERGAST: Yes, I'd say we're definitely working on the same case.
MARGO: Dr. Frock, I just saw a man back there who'd been wading in blood.
KAWAKITA: Someone's been murdered. Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either. Torn limb from limb. There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
FROCK: For heaven's sake, Greg, someone's been killed. Look, it's Cuthbert. Let's hear what really happened.
CUTHBERT: This has been a tragic and upsetting morning. I have terrible news for us all. A member of our security force has been found murdered. The police have just informed me it was Daniel Quiet. Please. With the help of our head of security, Mr. Ippolito. the museum has been secured.
CUTHBERT: The police are satisfied we're in no danger, that we're all perfectly safe. We've been asked to remain in the Gem Room and be available for questioning for the rest of the day. Obviously, we will all do everything we can to cooperate. Are there any
IPPOLITO: The party for the opening of the Superstition Exhibit. I imagine in the light of what's happened it will be pushed back.
CUTHBERT: No action has been taken yet. The opening of the exhibit is crucial to the financial health of this museum. So for now, we expect that the Superstition Exhibit will open on schedule, tomorrow night.
MARGO: That Cuthbert. What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
FROCK: Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success. The museum is in debt. Contributions and public funding have dried up. Admissions no longer cover overhead. The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit. Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red. If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
KAWAKITA: With all this bad publicity, it's no wonder he looks like that.
FROCK: Ian. Are you okay?
CUTHBERT: ( shakes his head ) Beauregard. I can't believe it. I may have been the last one to see him alive. He was with me just yesterday, when I got out the statue of Mbwun.
MARGO: ( taken aback ) ( sensing more gossip ) What's that?
KAWAKITA: ( sensing more gossip ) What's that?
MARGO: Warrior deity of the Kothoga, an extinct South American tribe. Dr. John Whittlesley led an expedition that found the only known representation of Mbwun. The statue is said to carry a curse. Every member of Whittlesley's expedition died.
CUTHBERT: I got the relic out yesterday to put on display. Beauregard was there. The crates had been broken into and the contents were strewn about. But nothing was missing. It was downright weird. We joked that it was the curse of Mbwun. I'm not laughing now.
FROCK: Come, Ian. We all know you're superstitious. But you're among scientists here. We deal in facts. That statue had nothing to do with what happened to Beauregard.
CUTHBERT: All I know is, everyone who has come in contact with that relic, is dead.
D'AGOSTA: ( mutters ) Get a life.
PENDERGAST: An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser. Amazing. I have a copy of this in my office at Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast. I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
D'AGOSTA: Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast. I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
PENDERGAST: In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
D'AGOSTA: I drink. After hours of course. On duty, I smoke. Do you mind?
PENDERGAST: Not at all. I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
D'AGOSTA: Then you won't like this one. It's a piece of shit.
PENDERGAST: Call me Vince.
D'AGOSTA: Call me Vince.
PENDERGAST: Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago? Twelve bodies on board.
D'AGOSTA: Who didn't? Big news. Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
PENDERGAST: Yes. That's my case. Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated. Brains extracted. Limbs torn to shreds. It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
D'AGOSTA: So the method of death is the only No. There's more. There were crates from this museum in the hold of the
PENDERGAST: No. There's more. There were crates from this museum in the hold of the
BAILEY: Uh, Vince. Sorry. This won't wait.
D'AGOSTA: It better be good.
BAILEY: There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder. Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story. You want to see If you don't mind, this could be You're kidding.
D'AGOSTA: ( rolls his eyes ) If you don't mind, this could be You're kidding.
PENDERGAST: If you don't mind, this could be You're kidding.
D'AGOSTA: You're kidding.
PENDERGAST: Unfortunately, no.
D'AGOSTA: Hi. I'm Lieutenant D'Agosta. You can call me Vince. This is Special Agent Pendergast. You can call him. Special Agent Pendergast.
BEASLEY: This is Henry Weiss and Larry So. Tell us about this monster.
D'AGOSTA: So. Tell us about this monster.
LARRY: We were lost and trying to find a short cut to the dino
HENRY: We were just lost, okay? And we went down this curvy staircase. At the bottom was a big shadow.
LARRY: Big as a house.
HENRY: Not that big.
LARRY: Well almost. Depends which house. It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
LARRY: And it snuffled the ground like a Like this.
HENRY: Like this.
LARRY: It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
HENRY: They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
LARRY: They were yellow!
HENRY: You're color blind.
BEASLEY: Boys, please! These two get in a lot of mischief and they tell some amazing whoppers.
D'AGOSTA: I can see that.
HENRY: This isn't a whopper! It's the How did you get away?
PENDERGAST: How did you get away?
HENRY: We ran and screamed and stuff. And we got through a little door just in time. There was a guard there and he went back to check.
PENDERGAST: A guard? Do you remember his name?
LARRY: He was wearing one of those I.D. badges. His name was Bo. something.
D'AGOSTA: EXT. MUSEUM - DAY An ambulance pulls away, lights flashing. Pendergast and D'Agosta walk to a squad car.
LARRY: EXT. MUSEUM - DAY An ambulance pulls away, lights flashing. Pendergast and D'Agosta walk to a squad car.
D'AGOSTA: I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my How do you explain the part about They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story. Nice I believed them.
PENDERGAST: How do you explain the part about They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story. Nice I believed them.
D'AGOSTA: They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story. Nice I believed them.
PENDERGAST: I believed them.
D'AGOSTA: You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells. like hamburger?
PENDERGAST: No. I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon. who wants us to believe he's a monster.
D'AGOSTA: ( totally confused )
DR. ZIEWZIC: You're late, Vince.
D'AGOSTA: Sorry Dr. Ziewzic. This is Special Agent Pendergast. Pendergast, Dr. Ziewzic. She runs the best chop shop in New York.
PENDERGAST: We've met. The Hacksaw Murders. '89.
DR. ZIEWZIC: Oh yes! Who could forget. Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
PENDERGAST: I hope you liked it.
DR. ZIEWZIC: Lovely bouquet. After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
D'AGOSTA: ( grumbles ) It's been one of those days.
DR. ZIEWZIC: ( she snaps her rubber glove ) Shall we get down to it, then?
DR. ZIEWZIC: ( for the microphone ) This is Dr. Matilda Ziewzic, assisted by Dr. Frederick Gross. It's Oct. 28, six fifteen p.m. We are joined by Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta of the NYPD, Special Agent Pendergast of the FBI and a police photographer. Let's see what we've
DR. ZIEWZIC: Caucasian male. Age about 27. Blond. Height well I can't give a height because Mr. Beauregard has been decapitated. The state of the body is such that other identifying marks are out of the question. There are numerous lacerations proceeding from the left anterior pectoral downwards through the sternum and terminating in the abdomen. This is a massive wound, two feet long and a foot wide. The head has suffered severe trauma and the occipital portion of the calavarium has been crushed and removed. It almost looks like.
DR. GROSS: ( beat ) A bite.
DR. ZIEWZIC: What are we talking about here?
PENDERGAST: Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
DR. ZIEWZIC: ( back to work ) The entire brain appears to have been extracted. May I see it,
DR. ZIEWZIC: Curious. There's something missing.
PENDERGAST: The thalamus and the hypothalamus, Yes. Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
DR. ZIEWZIC: ( looks up, surprised ) Yes. Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
D'AGOSTA: What happened to them?
PENDERGAST: If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
D'AGOSTA: ( incredulous ) Saliva test? You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
PENDERGAST: A long moment of silence, then. Zwiezic uses a swab for the saliva test, puts the result in a petrie dish.
DR. ZWIEZIC: Okay. One saliva test. Now. let's look at these lacerations. They start wide and then converge.
D'AGOSTA: Long fingernails? Scratches?
DR. ZWIEZIC: Too extreme. Perhaps some kind of weapon. I'm now probing the wound and. there's a piece of foreign material deep in the muscle, lodged on a rib. Photograph.
D'AGOSTA: Sweet Jesus.
DR. ZWIEZIC: It's a claw.
D'AGOSTA: I don't like animals. Never have. Dog bit me when I was little. After that I gave up on pets. Animals are irrational. Give me a psychotic killer any day. If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain. My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo. It was late August. Over ninety. The polar bear was inside his cave. Kids didn't know he was in there. All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear. By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces. The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother This isn't an animal, Vince. I've been on this case four months, remember? I've learned a few things.
PENDERGAST: This isn't an animal, Vince. I've been on this case four months, remember? I've learned a few things.
D'AGOSTA: You've been holding out on me Pendergast. You have a suspect capable of this?
PENDERGAST: Let me tell you about it, Vince.
PENDERGAST: Excuse me. Has Dr. Green left?
KAWAKITA: Before eight? You must be joking. She's in the physical anthro lab making up for lost time.
PENDERGAST: Dr. Green?
PENDERGAST: Special Agent Pendergast. FBI. Forgive me. I guess I was snooping. What is this?
MARGO: An invention of mine. It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA. I call it the Genetic Sequence How does it work?
PENDERGAST: How does it work?
MARGO: With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
PENDERGAST: ( a moment ) I came to talk about Dr. John
MARGO: Somehow, when all this happened. I knew it would come back to John. Is he really dead?
PENDERGAST: Maybe not.
MARGO: If he were alive he'd have contacted You have time to talk?
PENDERGAST: You have time to talk?
PENDERGAST: Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat. That boat washed up in my district. Everyone on board was And John?
MARGO: And John?
PENDERGAST: Disappeared. His body wasn't among the victims.
MARGO: I don't understand.
PENDERGAST: The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten. Just like Beauregard. One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision. The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
MARGO: John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that. He was a fine man despite his You loved him.
PENDERGAST: You loved him.
MARGO: ( a moment, taken aback ) Yes. Once. We met at Columbia. John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
PENDERGAST: You were going to be married.
MARGO: How did you know that?
PENDERGAST: I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley. Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times. I also found a record of your restraining order.
MARGO: That was two years ago. John was still in love with me. He wouldn't leave me alone.
PENDERGAST: You were afraid of him, weren't you?
MARGO: He was afraid of himself. He tried suicide once. He was ill. Manic depressive. He had wild emotional highs and lows. Not a happy affliction for a scientist. He'd been revered in our community. By the end he was a joke.
PENDERGAST: Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
MARGO: A legendary monster called Mbwun.
PENDERGAST: A monster?
MARGO: Yes. He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection. The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species". It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
PENDERGAST: What happened?
MARGO: No one knows. The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
MARGO: No. I'm all right. I won't let this affect me anymore. John wouldn't get help. His ego endangered the lives of others. His theory came first.
PENDERGAST: What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there? Was he desperate enough to create one?
MARGO: I don't understand.
PENDERGAST: Something came up in autopsy tonight. Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
MARGO: My God. Then it was an animal.
PENDERGAST: I don't think so. I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun. Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
MARGO: I don't know. He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation. But I've never seen it. It's in the exhibit.
PENDERGAST: Would you mind showing it to me?
PENDERGAST: Where would we find it?
MARGO: I'm not sure. We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
PENDERGAST: All right. I'm as macho as you are.
ON PENDERGAST: In another part of the exhibit, he nears a Mayan tomb. A skeleton in the center wears a headdress and tribal robes. Gold rings encircle bony fingers. Pendergast takes a moment to appreciate it, heads into the next hall.
ON MARGO: getting farther from pendergast, and ever deeper into the gloom. The walls around her are lined with symbols of witchcraft. There are shaman dancers, masks covered in grasses and shells. From the New Guinea coast there is Kokpah, God of a secret male society, and Zoe- ba, an awesome mannequin in black costume with an angry pointed mask. Finally the walls open up into another gallery. Beyond it is more of the shadowy hall. Margo stops and for the first time she wavers. This gallery is the most frightening yet. It features images of THE DEVIL from different cultures around the world. In the dim light, Margo is dwarfed by abhorrent statues of SATAN, TORNARSUK ( the Eskimo evil spirit ), INCUBI from India, Tibet, New Guinea etc. And there in the center of the gallery sitting on an altar and lit by a spot, is a small figurine. Margo is instantly drawn to it. As she gets close enough she sees the label in Gothic letters.
MBWUN: Savage God of the Kothoga, also known as "HE WHO WALKS ON ALL
CLAWS!: ON MARGO. she starts, then remembers Pendergast.
MARGO: Mr. Pendergast! I found it.
MARGO: Pendergast! Over here
MARGO: What the.
MARGO: ( no answer ) Who's there?
PENDERGAST: Dr. Green! Dr. Green!
PENDERGAST: What happened?
MARGO: I don't know.
PENDERGAST: I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
MARGO: ( she touches her forehead ) You were behind me? Running after
MARGO: It's okay, I'm all right. I remember now. It was an animal. Something large! I could smell it. It was hunting me. I saw two green eyes in the dark.
PENDERGAST: Where did you see it?
MARGO: Behind me. Over there.
MARGO: That's not what I saw.
PENDERGAST: All right. If you're positive. I can't think straight at the moment. I know how crazy this seems. Please, Mr. Pendergast, I need some fresh air. Could you get me out of
PENDERGAST: Stay in formation together. Take it room by room. Check for footprints, any signs of disturbance. If you see or hear anything the least bit suspicious, I want to know.
PENDERGAST: Bailey's going to be in the guard house outside. Officer Van Dorn is right down that hall. When McNitt's done, he'll relieve you.
PENDERGAST: Dr. Green.
MARGO: I didn't imagine it. I know what I saw. Are you sure there are enough men in there?
PENDERGAST: They're all heavily armed.
MARGO: ( stops ) All right. This is hard for me. I'm a scientist. I like order and logic. Sometimes too much. There's got to be an explanation. There can't be an animal in there. But I saw What was it?
PENDERGAST: What was it?
MARGO: I don't know. Mr. Pendergast. Do me a favor. Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
DOYLE: Bailey? Doyle here. I'm still waiting outside the exhibit. Where the hell is McNitt?
BAILEY: Should be there any minute. They came out a side door a while ago. Said the exhibit's clear. McNitt's headed back to spell you.
DOYLE: I'm on double over-time, man.
BAILEY: I know. You can go home if you want to. I'll come relieve you myself.
DOYLE: What the hell.
DOYLE: No answer. Doyle pauses. His hand goes to his gun for reassurance as he hears a footstep and a muffled thump. He moves to the door of the exhibit, opens it and takes a step inside.
DOYLE: McNitt? Cut the crap. I know it's you. You're not scaring me. Come on.
LEAPS OUT!: INT. EXHIBIT ENTRANCE - NIGHT Officer MCNITT enters from a side corridor, zipping up his fly. The hall is still. McNitt checks his watch, sees Doyle's walkie talkie and turns it on.
MCNITT: McNitt here. I'm outside the exhibit. All's quiet. But I don't see Doyle.
MCNITT: Well he's gone.
MCNITT: ( chuckles )
PENDERGAST: I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
CUTHBERT: If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
PENDERGAST: I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
CUTHBERT: We've been operating in the red for years. That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit. It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute. No. I don't want to think about We all love the museum. I come here myself with my kids. We're trying to work with you.
D'AGOSTA: ( chews on his toothpick, mild ) We all love the museum. I come here myself with my kids. We're trying to work with you.
CUTHBERT: I appreciate that.
PENDERGAST: If the party goes forward, and that's a big if. I've arranged for a large police presence.
CUTHBERT: Do they have to wear uniforms?
PENDERGAST: I don't want to scare people.
CUTHBERT: I don't want to scare people.
PENDERGAST: I understand. But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems. Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
KAWAKITA: What do you make of it, Margo?
MARGO: It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
PENDERGAST: That would jive with what we got from the preliminary DNA read-out. Here, have a look.
MARGO: According to this, twenty-five percent of the claw DNA is unidentifiable, about a third is homo sapien, and the rest is Hemidactylus Turcicus.
D'AGOSTA: ( looks over ) What's that?
MARGO: Turkish Gecko, I believe. A lizard.
KAWAKITA: Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand? Impossible. The sample must be contaminated.
MARGO: There's another possibility. A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
PENDERGAST: Genetic damage?
MARGO: When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair. Viruses can damage DNA. So can radiation, certain chemicals. Even cancer. Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out. I have to get started. This will take several hours.
PENDERGAST: We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
KAWAKITA: Try Dr. Frock. He's the curator of Plant Biology. All the curators have keys. And he knows every inch of this museum. The rest of us still get lost.
PENDERGAST: Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
FROCK: Happy to be useful. It's rare enough these days. According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
PENDERGAST: How many storage areas are there?
FROCK: They fill seven floors. We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world. Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens. Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems. Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
D'AGOSTA: This place is a maze.
FROCK: I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
PENDERGAST: ( looks over ) Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
FROCK: Yes. John made quite a study of the whole museum. He had a copy of my original plans.
MARGO: Osteo prep, Karl.
D'AGOSTA: My kind of art.
KARL: They keep me company. Gets kinda lonely sometimes.
D'AGOSTA: My favorite is the two camels.
KARL: Really? I'm partial to the skunks.
FROCK: Did you ever wonder where we get all our skeletons? This is the laboratory where animal carcasses are reduced to bones. What's cooking today, Don?
DON: Frock looks into a large maceration tank with Pendergast and D'Agosta. A zebra carcass can be seen under the muddy surface, its flesh and soft tissues falling off.
D'AGOSTA: Man, that's ripe.
FROCK: Dermestid beetles. The second method of preparing a skeleton, used in Natural History Museums world wide. Bugs are clean and highly efficient. They'll polish that fox off in no Want to have a look at a gorilla brain? Got one right here.
OSTERBAAN: Want to have a look at a gorilla brain? Got one right here.
FROCK: Thanks Don. We're in a hurry. Some other time.
FROCK: This should be it. Can you read the
D'AGOSTA: Holy shit. Something tried to get into this And failed. These doors are solid This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
FROCK: Something tried to get into this And failed. These doors are solid This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
PENDERGAST: And failed. These doors are solid This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
FROCK: This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
PENDERGAST: I wouldn't be so sure.
PENDERGAST: This must be the one that held the statue. Let's see what else is The lid of this crate is scratched with claw marks, just like the door.
D'AGOSTA: The lid of this crate is scratched with claw marks, just like the door.
D'AGOSTA: Look. It's some kind of letter.
FROCK: ( excited ) May I see that?
FROCK: It's from John. Those two arrows were his insignia. It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
PENDERGAST: Read it out loud.
FROCK: "Dear Louis, end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates. You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days. So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded. We've made an incredible find. I enclose a representation of Mbwun. Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate. I know because I've seen the beast."
FROCK: Did you hear that? My God. He says that Mbwun is real!
D'AGOSTA: ( snorts ) Pardon my French, but bull shit.
FROCK: This on top of the scratches. isn't it proof!
PENDERGAST: I think the scratches were put there to scare us. Perhaps even lead us to this note.
PENDERGAST: You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide?
FROCK: Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide?
PENDERGAST: Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide?
FROCK: Not really. Just the sub-basement.
PENDERGAST: Where is that?
FROCK: I don't know. It was walled over. No one's been down there in years.
PENDERGAST: You said you had plans of the museum. Could we see them, please?
FROCK: I know they're here somewhere. It's a good thing we caught the movers in time. They're nineteen century blueprints from when the museum was built. I remember the sub-basement was below the regular basement, linked to the city sewer. I only know about it because it flooded all the way up to the museum during the hurricane of '49. I lost so many precious books.
FROCK: Eureka. Who says it doesn't pay to be a pack rat? Now please be careful with these. When you're done, I'd like them back.
D'AGOSTA: How big is the sub-basement?
PENDERGAST: Apparently it's huge.
D'AGOSTA: I think I should come with you.
PENDERGAST: We haven't got time. You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
PENDERGAST: These plans indicate there's a walled over entrance to the sub- basement right around here.
JONATHAN: The dogs are picking up something, Mr. Pendergast.
DEPUTY ONE: What is this? A dungeon?
IPPOLITO: This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant. You'll just scare people off. I can handle the security behind scenes with this system. It's state of the art.
D'AGOSTA: The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito. Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
IPPOLITO: It's fool proof, basically. I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip. If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted That's great if you're stopping a burglar. Not our goal here. Are there motion detectors?
D'AGOSTA: That's great if you're stopping a burglar. Not our goal here. Are there motion detectors?
IPPOLITO: In every exhibition room. The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five. We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire That would leave one exit for hundreds of people. You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books. We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells. One more question. I see a big hole. If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant. There are safeguards built in. We have back-up systems with redundancies. There's no way these computers can fail.

FROCK: I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked. If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
MARGO: A blow dart. Seed pods. A plant press. Pretty unimpressive stuff.
FROCK: Let me see the plant press.
MARGO: What is it?
FROCK: I'm not sure. As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct. This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui. John used it as packing You're right.
MARGO: Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui. John used it as packing You're right.
FROCK: You're right.
FROCK: They're curiously fleshy.
KAWAKITA: And they smell delicious.
KAWAKITA: Taste great.
FROCK: I wouldn't put that in your mouth until we do a chemical analysis, I can handle that for you while we're waiting on the G.S.E.
KAWAKITA: I can handle that for you while we're waiting on the G.S.E.
MARGO: What about those seed pods? Are they from the same plant?
FROCK: Margo, these aren't seed pods.
MARGO: What are they?
FROCK: They're eggs.
PENDERGAST: Hard to read in this light. The ink is so faded.
JONATHAN: The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast. Maybe we should head Not yet. Let's try the fork to the
PENDERGAST: Not yet. Let's try the fork to the
DEPUTY TWO: This place gives me the creeps.
JONATHAN: They've got something.
PENDERGAST: Keep the light up. I can't see.
PENDERGAST: Shut them up!
JONATHAN: Heel Argo! Hobbes! Heel!
JONATHAN: They're going crazy! I need help!
JONATHAN: He's loose! Argo!
PENDERGAST: Holy mother, what is that?
JONATHAN: Holy mother, what is that?
DEPUTY ONE: Smells God-awful. Like rotten meat.
JONATHAN: Argo! Come!
PENDERGAST: A SCUFFLING sound of claws dragging on brick is heard followed by a ROAR. The men all freeze. The other dog leaps and twists with excitement. In the confusion it also breaks free! It tears after the first dog, disappearing into the darkness. Now Jonathan is wild-eyed.
JONATHAN: No! Hobbes!
PENDERGAST: Forget the dogs. You two, get back here. Don't point that gun at me.
JONATHAN: Argo! Hobbes!
PENDERGAST: Get back! Now!
JONATHAN: You shot my dog!
JONATHAN: My dog.
DEPUTY ONE: ( stammers ) He was coming right at me.
DEPUTY TWO: Let's get out of here!
JONATHAN: I'm not going anywhere! Not without my dog!
JONATHAN: DEPUTY ONE
DEPUTY ONE: Get back!
JONATHAN: There's something out there! Let's go get it now! That's why we came down here, isn't it?
PENDERGAST: ( to the deputies ) He's right. Follow me.
DEPUTY ONE: No way. I say we get help. A lot more guns.
PENDERGAST: I'm ordering you! Cover me!
DEPUTY TWO: We'll cover you from here!
JONATHAN: Look. It's Hobbes! He's all right.
PENDERGAST: Come on. Let's get back to the others. We can't leave them alone.
JONATHAN: It's alright. I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone. What is this Not on the map. Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
PENDERGAST: Not on the map. Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
PENDERGAST: We're coming back! Identify yourself! Who's there?
PENDERGAST: Identify yourself! Who's there?
JONATHAN: Oh. my. God!
PENDERGAST: ( hisses )
PENDERGAST: Stay calm.
D'AGOSTA: I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast. I think you should call it off.
CUTHBERT: It's too late now. Guests are arriving. The Mayor's car is pulling I'll go down and speak to him.
D'AGOSTA: I'll go down and speak to him.
CUTHBERT: ( irritated ) You haven't got the authority. Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
D'AGOSTA: Pendergast may be in trouble. Don't you understand? He still hasn't come back. It's been over three hours
CUTHBERT: He'll be back. Relax. We're in good shape. Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious. There's no reason to call off the opening now.
KAWAKITA: What kind of egg is it?
MARGO: It's reptilian.
FROCK: Like the claw.
MARGO: ( cautious ) Let's not jump to conclusions. This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
FROCK: ( excited ) Come on, Margo. We're on the verge of something huge. Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room. What if John was right. I mean, what if? And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates. When it got to the museum, it hatched.
MARGO: Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat. Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard. If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
KAWAKITA: I guess you're not interested in this plant anymore, but the chemical analysis is done. Frock reads the computer over Greg's shoulder.
FROCK: "Genus: Unknown. Family: Unknown. Order: Unknown. Phylum: Unknown. Cripes, Margo, what did you give me? Is this an animal or one funky I see you've been programming the computer vocabulary again.
MARGO: ( points to a hexagonal symbol ) Look at this. An ambyloid reovirus protein. That explains why the computer's confused. The plant's infected with a virus.
FROCK: That's not so unusual. Many plants carry viruses. Like the burls on Maple trees.
MARGO: But a virus normally codes for other viruses. This one's making human and animal proteins. Listen to this. "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone. 4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
KAWAKITA: These plant fibers are loaded with What kind of hormones?
MARGO: What kind of hormones?
KAWAKITA: 4-monoxytocin is. "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
MARGO: Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
FROCK: A hormone secreted by the human thalamus gland.
MARGO: This is it. This is what he, or it. is after! The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
KAWAKITA: So what?
MARGO: Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
KAWAKITA: ( pales ) Eats them?
MARGO: Yes. Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant. When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach. The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
FROCK: Beauregard's head. It's all right. That means the G.S.E. has finished analyzing the claw DNA. Greg, you go find Pendergast and Lieutenant D'Agosta
MARGO: It's all right. That means the G.S.E. has finished analyzing the claw DNA. Greg, you go find Pendergast and Lieutenant D'Agosta
DRUNK: Hey, where 'za little boys room?
KAWAKITA: Down that hallway. But don't stay long. You don't want to be here
MARGO: All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw. "Species unidentified. Genus: unidentified. Phylum unknown. Male, weight in excess of 240 kg. Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. Quadrupedal! The other name for Mbwun. "He Who Walks on All Fours." "Nocturnal. External hair and bony plates. Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers. Reduced optic chiasm". poor eyesight. "External mucoid nasal glands,". very keen scent. "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust. Aggressiveness: So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.

FROCK: So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
MARGO: With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
FROCK: ( a long moment ) Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
MARGO: And it's hungry. It's been two days since it's eaten. There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell! All those people in one enclosed space.
FROCK: It's like ringing the dinner bell.
CUTHBERT: Thank you everyone and welcome. We're glad all of you were willing to brave the inclement weather to be with us tonight. Our special thanks to his honor, the mayor and his lovely wife.
KAWAKITA: Lieutenant! It's me.
D'AGOSTA: What is it?
KAWAKITA: Dr. Green has to see you!
D'AGOSTA: Got my hands full here.
KAWAKITA: It's important. Please. You have to come! Pendergast, too. She's found out something.
D'AGOSTA: McNitt? D'Agosta here.
MCNITT: Yeah Lieutenant? I'm here.
MCNITT: Not yet.
MCNITT: Hold on Lieutenant. What was that?
GEORGE: Probably just something wrong with the air conditioning. There's a shit load of electrical rooms back there.
MCNITT: Lieutenant? There's something wrong in the computer room.
GEORGE: You're over-reacting. Sounds like the air conditioning to me.
D'AGOSTA: Damn. There's some kind of problem in the computer room. I have to go get Ippolito. You wait here.
CUTHBERT: Here we have a very rare sacrificial table from Mesoamerica. The priests would kill the victim on this slab, cut out the heart and eat it while it was still beating.
MAYOR: I could use one of these things in City Hall. You're letting kids see this? I should think they'd have nightmares.
MAYOR'S WIFE: You're letting kids see this? I should think they'd have nightmares.
CUTHBERT: Kid will love it. They're our target audience. Nothing here is as violent as what they see on T.V.
MAYOR: I don't know. That could be a little over the top. It's not even scientific. Mummies don't bleed.
CUTHBERT: Oh. my. God.
IPPOLITO: Quiet everyone!
WOMAN: There's a body up there!
MCNITT: George! Get out here, now!
MCNITT: George! Where are you?
MCNITT: Hey you? George! Damn it. Where are you? No response.
MCNITT: George! We've got an emergency! Are you here?
MCNITT: Oh God. Oh God!
MCNITT: George! I saw something in there! I fired but I think I missed it!
MCNITT: George, for Chrissake answer me!
KAWAKITA: What happened?!
D'AGOSTA: There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
D'AGOSTA: What the hell is going on?!
IPPOLITO: The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
D'AGOSTA: What doors?
IPPOLITO: I told you! They seal off all the cells. They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure
D'AGOSTA: You said the system couldn't fail!
BAILEY: Above you! Look out!
D'AGOSTA: Ippolito! Get back here!
IPPOLITO: Like hell!
MARGO: What's going on?
FROCK: Some kind of power failure. Maybe it's the storm. Do you have a I think so.
MARGO: I think so.
FROCK: Greg's been gone over a half hour. We'd better get out of here. Get the
MARGO: Dr. Frock. Did you hear that?
FROCK: Don't stop now.
MARGO: What's that?
FROCK: It's one of the fire doors. Good Lord, Margo. We're trapped!
PENDERGAST: I know where we are now. We're getting out, Jonathan. This should be another door.
JONATHAN: Hallelujah, Pendergast. Where the hell are we now?
JONATHAN: Jesus, what is this?
PENDERGAST: Another storage room.
PENDERGAST: Something's happened. The power's
PENDERGAST: All right. I know where we are. This is the osteo prep lab. I was in here earlier. We're safe now.
JONATHAN: Oh no. I smell it.
PENDERGAST: Keep the animal quiet.
PENDERGAST: Go out the other doorway. There's a stair at the end of the hall. Up five flights is a corridor that leads to the Hall of the Heavens. Find Lieutenant D'Agosta. Bring

ON PENDERGAST. as he levels his gun and shoots. THE CREATURE. stops, rears back on its haunches, looks once at Pendergast, pissed. As the VOICES around the far corner fall silent, Pendergast FIRES. The shot blasts off a piece of the wall. With astonishing speed and agility for its bulk, the beast turns and leaps around the corner, passing out of Pendergast's sight.
PENDERGAST: Margo! Frock! It's coming! Run!
FROCK: Margo points her light in the distance and illuminates the beast! It's descending like a freight train. One split second of sheer amazement, Frock, immobilized in his wheel chair, stares at the monster, like a trapped rabbit looking at a descending hawk. Margo grabs his keys from him, fumbles desperately to open the door. It swings wide at last. She grabs the handles of the wheelchair, tugs with all her might. The wheels bump into the door frame but somehow she wrestles the damn thing inside.
MARGO: Dr. Frock! Quick!
PENDERGAST: No. I think I'm hallucinating.
MARGO: You're not. Where is it?
PENDERGAST: ( shakes his head ) No. A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball. I think it was bothered by my light.
MARGO: No. A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball. I think it was bothered by my light.
PENDERGAST: No. A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball. I think it was bothered by my light.
MARGO: That would fit. It's nocturnal. Quick. Come inside.

MAN: We're trapped! And there's a killer in here!
D'AGOSTA: We'll get out safely if everyone stays calm. Is anyone else hurt?
MAYOR: Yes. My wife.
D'AGOSTA: Is there a doctor?
POUND: I'm Dr. Pound.
D'AGOSTA: Check this woman and see if anyone else needs you.
JONATHAN: ( calls ) Lieutenant D'Agosta! Don't shoot.
D'AGOSTA: Where's Pendergast?
JONATHAN: ( crossing, breathless ) Five flights down. We were lost in the sub-basement. Something's down there. It killed our two deputies. When I left Pendergast it was coming back. He sent me for help. We have to hurry.
D'AGOSTA: Both of you. Get back here.
POUND: But he's still alive
D'AGOSTA: Get back now!
CUTHBERT: What's going on?
D'AGOSTA: There's some kind of animal loose in the museum. Pendergast's alone. He needs help. I want volunteers to go with me.
BAILEY: I'm in.
KAWAKITA: ( swallows ) Me too.
CUTHBERT: ( voice rising in fear ) I'd do it gladly but someone needs to stay with these people.
D'AGOSTA: All right. You're elected. Bailey, get all the guns and flashlights, give the mayor your walkie talkie so we can keep in touch. Cuthbert, keep everyone together and make sure they stay quiet.
FRANK: I was in the Marines. Give me a gun. I'd go with you, too, but I've got my daughter.
D'AGOSTA: What's your name?
FRANK: All right. You guard these people and your daughter.
D'AGOSTA: All right. You guard these people and your daughter.
MAYOR'S WIFE: ( to D'Agosta ) Where are you going? Don't leave us
MAYOR: Everyone quiet. The Lieutenant's in
D'AGOSTA: Bailey, we'll go first and check the stairwell. Jonathan, you and Greg guard the door.
KAWAKITA: Excuse me. Could you tell me how this thing works?
JONATHAN: Oh Jesus. Don't point it at me. Just aim and shoot.
D'AGOSTA: ( low ) Hold on. I thought I saw something.
D'AGOSTA: Whoa. You smell that?
JONATHAN: Lieutenant! Get back!
D'AGOSTA: Bailey SCREAMS in terror as Mbwun pins him down!
BAILEY!!!: Bailey SCREAMS in terror as Mbwun pins him down!
BAILEY: CLOSE ON BAILEY. Three claws close on his neck and WRENCH HARD! There's a horrifying snap as Bailey's HEAD COMES OFF! Blood SPURTS all over and drips down the stairs. D'AGOSTA levels his shotgun at the monster and fires, with no apparent effect. When the shots stop echoing we hear SCREAMS and FRANTIC BARKING from the hall. MBWUN'S GREEN EYES look up and it's FORKED TONGUE LICKS OUT. The monster LEAPS PAST Bailey's body and heads for the door! D'Agosta, seeing what's happening, screams at the top of his lungs.

D'AGOSTA: Cuthbert's gone.
D'AGOSTA: Jonathan, go with him! He isn't
MAYOR: Good luck!
IPPOLITO: All right everyone. I'm in charge. Status report.
WATERS: Swat teams are on the way. Fire trucks with them. Everything's slowed down because of the rain. We're bringing in portable generators. They'll get the emergency lights working but they won't pump enough power to lift the
IPPOLITO: D'Agosta? Ippolito. Come in.
IPPOLITO: I made it outside. I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here. Help is on the way. Just sit tight.
WATERS: Did he say monster?
IPPOLITO: Panic attack.
MAYOR: Mayor Jordan here.
MAYOR: Don't tell me what to do you chicken shit bastard. I saw you cut and run! Lieutenant D'Agosta stayed with us. He is in charge. There is a monster. I saw it. Cut through those doors and get us out of here, now!
IPPOLITO: All right. The steel doors are designed to retard cutting. We can go through them, but it would take The quickest way in would be to go through the roof, sir. Cell two goes up to the fifth floor. There are sky lights up there.
WATERS: The quickest way in would be to go through the roof, sir. Cell two goes up to the fifth floor. There are sky lights up there.
IPPOLITO: Co-ordinate with the fire department and SWAT teams. Move.
PENDERGAST: I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish. Like nothing I ever saw. I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
MARGO: It's not supernatural. Mbwun is an animal. Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
PENDERGAST: But this isn't the jungle! This is New York. How did it get here? A thing like that crossed two continents. It makes no sense!
FROCK: ( lame ) We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
PENDERGAST: I don't believe it.
MARGO: None of that matters now. The people upstairs need us. We have to help.
FROCK: We can't. We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe. I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements. If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do. The building must be swarming with police by now. It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
MARGO: That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
PENDERGAST: But what can we do? Our guns are We have the fibers. Don't you see? The creature is hungry. It wants the hormones in these plants. It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers. We're just a poor substitute. To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.

CUTHBERT: Solid oak. Two inches thick. Tell me they'll hold.
CUTHBERT: I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
JONATHAN: Where's the walk-in safe?
CUTHBERT: Behind you.
JONATHAN: What's the combination?
CUTHBERT: I'll do it. Just let me find my portable phone.
JONATHAN: Forget it!
CUTHBERT: Calm down. I found it!
CUTHBERT: Battery's dead. Shit.
JONATHAN: Let's go!
CUTHBERT: That thing won't come after us, right? It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement. Poor fools.
JONATHAN: Hurry up!
CUTHBERT: Just a minute. I'm shaking! Take the
CUTHBERT: Oh God! I dropped my rabbit's foot!
JONATHAN: For Chrissake, I'll do it. What's the combination?!
CUTHBERT: To the left twice then five no. sorry. I think it's fifteen. it's been a while.
JONATHAN: Oh Jesus.
JONATHAN: Fifteen. what's next?
CUTHBERT: Eight to the right! Look! I found
PENDERGAST: All clear.
FROCK: I'm coming with you.
MARGO: No, Dr. Frock. You can't.
PENDERGAST: You'd slow us down and put Margo in Unlock one of the other storage rooms. We're going upstairs. We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
MARGO: Unlock one of the other storage rooms. We're going upstairs. We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
FROCK: Margo, this is too dangerous. You always think you can solve everything. This time you don't have enough information. The animal might behave in unexpected ways. Leave her here with me. Don't put her in danger.
PENDERGAST: He's right.
MARGO: No. You'll need me
FROCK: What's that?
PENDERGAST: No, not footsteps! People running for their lives!
MARGO: No, not footsteps! People running for their lives!
FROCK: Come back and get me.
MARGO: We will.
FROCK: Remember, it has poor eyesight. It hunts with its sense of smell. So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
KAWAKITA: It's still back there!
D'AGOSTA: I know.
D'AGOSTA: INT. HALL OF NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT Margo and Pendergast run. Margo carries the crate carefully wrapped in Pendergast's jacket.
PENDERGAST: That was D'Agosta.
MARGO: The planetarium!
PENDERGAST: ( calls out ) Over here!
D'AGOSTA: ( through the window ) Pendergast! Help! It's right behind This door's locked. Try shooting the hinges off.
PENDERGAST: This door's locked. Try shooting the hinges off.
D'AGOSTA: Step back!
D'AGOSTA: It's no use. We have to get out of Give them your walkie talkie.
KAWAKITA: Is Dr. Frock safe!
MARGO: Yes, he's fine. Greg. take care of
MARGO: Is there another way around?
PENDERGAST: No. The planetarium is in the next cell. This is one of the fire
PENDERGAST: Vince? There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
D'AGOSTA: The sub-basement?
PENDERGAST: I've been down there. It links up to the old sewer system. I can guide you out.
D'AGOSTA: How much ammo do we have to make a You're asking me? I don't even know how to load this thing.
KAWAKITA: You're asking me? I don't even know how to load this thing.
FRANK: Four rounds.
D'AGOSTA: Oh shit.
D'AGOSTA: I smell it. It's here.
PENDERGAST: Go out the north exit! There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases. Run!
D'AGOSTA: Everybody. Get behind me.
PENDERGAST: Hide quickly!
MARGO: What are you going to do?
PENDERGAST: Buy them some time.
PENDERGAST: Hey you big tub of lard! Over here!
PENDERGAST: Come on, you smelly pile of refuse. Come get me. I dare you!
MARGO: What is it doing?
PENDERGAST: ( loud ) It's scared of me.
PENDERGAST: Drop the fibers!
PENDERGAST: What happened?
MARGO: Its eyesight is worse than I thought. It couldn't see us. And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
PENDERGAST: It didn't want the fibers. What does that mean?
MARGO: I think. it means it's full.
PENDERGAST: Then it won't go after the others?
MARGO: No. It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
PENDERGAST: For what?
MARGO: I think. for the pleasure of the
D'AGOSTA: That's it, let's go!
D'AGOSTA: ( into walkie talkie ) Pendergast. We made it. You all
PENDERGAST: We're fine. Take the left fork behind you. You'll be in a straight passage. When the hall forks again in fifty yards go right. Then radio
D'AGOSTA: All right. Kawakita, cover the rear.
KAWAKITA: Oh shit.
FRANK: No, Lieutenant. He's not a good enough shot. I'll do it if you take care of my daughter.
D'AGOSTA: Damn. It's getting deep. See
FRANK: You'll be the first to know.
D'AGOSTA: Pendergast? I made the right hand fork. We're already in about three feet of water. Where should we go?
D'AGOSTA: FRANK ( OS )
D'AGOSTA: Frank! Are you all right!
MAYOR: It's too late!
LAUREN: D'Agosta turns his flashlight on the water. It's running red! He spins to the Mayor, points down the tunnel.
D'AGOSTA: People start to cry and whimper as the Mayor urges them on. He takes charge of Lauren. Only Greg Kawakita stays with D'Agosta. They stand shoulder to shoulder and completely alone. Thrashing in the water can be heard as the beast comes closer. There's a low, pleasurable growl! Both men lift their guns.
D'AGOSTA: On three.
D'AGOSTA: One. two.
KAWAKITA: I think it's gone. I think you took its tonsils out!
D'AGOSTA: I think you took its tonsils out!
MAYOR: Which way!
D'AGOSTA: This way!
KAWAKITA: Holy shit.
PENDERGAST: Vince? Can you hear me? Vince!
MARGO: We have to try and draw it off!
PENDERGAST: The answer's right in front of us. That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing. The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
MARGO: The answer's right in front of us. That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing. The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
MARGO: That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing. The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
PENDERGAST: ( starts running ) It's deceptively simple. Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
MARGO: Help! Please someone! Help!
JENNINGS: We're ready. We've got enough firepower to turn a herd of lions into a fine red mist.
IPPOLITO: Then do it.
JONATHAN: It's okay, Hobbes. We'll be all right. Help has got to come eventually. We'll make it. We'll be
JONATHAN: Hey! Wake up!
DRUNK: Who the hell are you?
JONATHAN: You first.
DRUNK: I got lost tryin' to find the bathroom. I was walkin' in circles. I lay down for a nap. What's going You wouldn't believe me if I told
JONATHAN: You wouldn't believe me if I told
JONATHAN: What is it, boy?
DRUNK: Where we going?
JONATHAN: I think we're going home.
JONATHAN: Hello! We're over here!
JENNINGS: Are you hurt?
JONATHAN: We're fine. I don't know about the people downstairs. In the Hall of the Heavens. The basement. you'll need help. There's a monster down
JENNINGS: The rescue workers will lift you out one at a time.
MARGO: Help someone!
PENDERGAST: Oh God! Help!
MARGO: You smell that?
PENDERGAST: It's coming. Run.
D'AGOSTA: At least we'll be dry.
KAWAKITA: I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
D'AGOSTA: Not so loud.
KAWAKITA: What's that?
D'AGOSTA: All right everybody, hold up! We don't know what's in there. Let me go first.
D'AGOSTA: We don't know what's in there. Let me go first.
D'AGOSTA: What does it say?
KAWAKITA: ( looks up, shocked ) Dr. John Whittlesley.
D'AGOSTA: What's that doing here?
KAWAKITA: I don't know. I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
MAYOR: ( interrupts ) Look. There's a ladder at the end. I think it goes up to the street!
KAWAKITA: What is that?
SCREAMS!: The wide dirt floor around them is carpeted in clean white BONES! The HUMMING noise is louder and we see its source. Atop the bones is the body of CUTHBERT! It's covered with BLACK DERMESTID BEETLES. They're stripping the skeleton clean, devouring the flesh! The group panics and breaks for the ladder. Kawakita and D'Agosta once more guard the rear.
KAWAKITA: Dear God. Where are we, Lieutenant?
D'AGOSTA: I'd say we're in its home.
PENDERGAST: We're not going to make the storage Listen to me, Pendergast. Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien. In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain! If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it. Shoot it in the eye!
MARGO: Listen to me, Pendergast. Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien. In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain! If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it. Shoot it in the eye!
PENDERGAST: Please, no! Don't hurt Margo! My God. You understand.
MARGO: My God. You understand.
MARGO: Please let me go. We won't hurt you.
PENDERGAST: She takes off blindly in the maze-like room. From somewhere behind her she hears a horrible HOWL. ON MARGO. as she twists and turns through the rows of display cases, tearing blindly in the dark. Ahead is a door. She dives through it and finds she's in.
MARGO: John's necklace! You killed him!
MARGO: Oh Jesus. John?
MARGO: No. It's not possible!
MARGO: John? If it is you. I can help.
MARGO: No! Don't kill him! Pendergast, you were right. It's John!
PENDERGAST: That thing is John Whittlesley. I should have seen it before! The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA! He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states. He probably entered the country as a man. It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum! I don't believe it.

PENDERGAST: I don't believe it.
MARGO: You have to! Listen! All viruses pass on their own DNA. Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses! This one was different. It inserted a whole array of genes into John. Reptile genes, sixty five million years old. Those genes remade him! It's not his fault!
PENDERGAST: Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
WATERS: We can't raise the S.W.A.T. team. No one's answering! What do you want to
IPPOLITO: Holy shit. Pull him up.
IPPOLITO: Get more guns! Now!
IPPOLITO: Get back! We're going to shoot!
MARGO: No. Wait! Let me talk to him first!
IPPOLITO: ( screaming ) Kill that thing! Kill it now!
MARGO: MBWUN. turns and sees Margo. She speaks desperately.
MARGO: John. you can give up now! Just lie down where you are!
WATERS: Holy shit it's coming this way!
IPPOLITO: It's headed for the roof. Run!
WATERS: Get back here, you asshole! We can't let it get out! Surround the opening and kill it!
WATERS: Back, everybody! That's an order!
MARGO: Just like John. He won't listen.
PENDERGAST: I have to shoot.
MARGO: Do it, quickly. Please. Aim for the
PENDERGAST: He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot. Call him, Margo.
MARGO: I can't!
PENDERGAST: You have to. Do it now! John! John, look at me!
MARGO: John! John, look at me!
KAWAKITA: Margo Green. Have you seen her?
PENDERGAST: She's over here.
PENDERGAST: Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
D'AGOSTA: The sub-basement, huh? Great idea.
MARGO: No time for fishing anymore?
KAWAKITA: Got to finish this thesis sometime.
MARGO: How about lunch?
KAWAKITA: Not today. Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting
MARGO: Margo exits. Greg returns to his work.
MARGO: Dr. Frock?
FROCK: Look who's here, Margo.
MARGO: I'm so glad to see you. What's the I'm in town on a case. Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
PENDERGAST: I'm in town on a case. Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
PENDERGAST: Dr. Frock, I was wondering. What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
FROCK: They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
D'AGOSTA: Shouldn't a drug that powerful be The virus itself might have positive applications. They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made. Greg isn't joining us?
FROCK: The virus itself might have positive applications. They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made. Greg isn't joining us?
MARGO: He's changed. He's always working on his thesis. He comes in early, stays late. I tried to get him to join us, but he never takes a break.
PENDERGAST: We did the right thing, Margo.
MARGO: Yes. I know.
