CAROLINE: Nanotherapy, beta version: Tuesday, March 10, 2011. Female Test subject Number four. Franklin reaches for us, smiles.
FRANKLIN: Here we go, Bright eyes. A MIST fogs our view for a moment.
CAROLINE: Not too much. She needs to be calm, but alert.
WILL: Start the scan. A TECHIE sits at a computer screen beside Will.
TECHIE: INT. WHITE ROOM DAY Another tech, DONNIE - skinny, tattooed - controls the Caroline moves to an IV STAND beside the scan. The bag's full of a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN LIQUID.
DONNIE: Stuff looks like Kool-aid.
CAROLINE: Go ahead, I'm sure you could use Starting the therapy.
FRANKLIN: She's convulsing. Caroline sticks a stethoscope in the tube, listens to Bright Eyes' heart.
WILL: ( INTO INTERCOM )
WILL: Good to know. Just keep it from She's stung, wonders, why does he have to be such a jerk He's oblivious to this, instead intent on getting the scan right. The green liquid moves through the chimp's neck.
TECHIE: Here we go. Will stares at the scan, his eyes willing the test to succeed.. .the green liquid LIGHTS UP THE CHIMP'S BRAIN.
WILL: We're on our way.
CAROLINE: What is this? Caroline holds up a picture of a tree for Bright Eyes, who sits at a table in front of a LEXIGRAM, a lit-up board with colorful symbols. Bright Eyes presses a button.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: SUPER: "ONE MONTH LATER." Caroline holds up a picture of an acorn.
CAROLINE: And this? The chimp presses another button.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Where does the acorn come from? Bright Eyes considers. then presses a button.
CAROLINE: Where does the acorn come from? Bright Eyes considers. then presses a button.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Yes, but where does the acorn come Bright Eyes interrupts, now pressing three buttons.
CAROLINE: Yes, but where does the acorn come Bright Eyes interrupts, now pressing three buttons.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: NO -
CAROLINE: NO -
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Acorn. Tree. Acorn. The chimp looks at Caroline, who's stunned, trying to process the ADVANCED THINKING JUST MANIFESTED. Then she presses another button.
CAROLINE: We started the therapy four weeks ago. This was yesterday. Will's studying the scans. They look good. Real good.
WILL: I see that. But I don't understand the primate behavioral norms. She knows an acorn's a seed. Wouldn't any monkey know that?
CAROLINE: No - it's conceptual. Acorn gives us a tree, which gives us an acorn.
WILL: Abstract thought.
CAROLINE: In a chimpanzee. Unheard of. Will turns the possibilities over in his mind. Caroline moves away from him. He barely notices her now.
WILL: Start the other's on the 112.
WILL: Hey Dad. Walter looks up, whispers.
WALTER: John. is that you?
WILL: It's me. Will.
WALTER: As thou dost, Anthony. ( staring at the keys ) .he hears no music. No music.
VOICE: ( heavy Russian accent ) He's been doing that all day. A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA.
IRENA: He found an old book of his. She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's pocket. He snatches it from her, puts it back.
WILL: My mother was the one. She liked Good night, Walter, hone-ee. She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm.
IRENA: ( KISSES HIM )
I WILL: Come on, Dad.
WILL: Remember I told you we were using Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on the apes? Well the therapy seems to be working. We've seen definite signs of adult brain neurogenesis.
WALTER: I rather tell that what is to be feared than what I fear: for always. I am Caesar. There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries..
WILL: I'm going to make you better - I swear it. His father looks at him. A moment of recognition?
WALTER: John. ?
WILL: ( DISAPPOINTED )
FRANKLIN: Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam. Monty. Hey - what's the matter, don't like my cooking?
CAROLINE: Something wrong with Bright Eyes?
FRANKLIN: I'll check on her when we're done. Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY - into the next room, where Caroline waits beside the CT scanner. Lucky's head is shaved, exposing a long, curving scar on his From Bright Eyes' vantage point she can see through the open door as Lucky's strapped down.
JACOBS: You could at least try to look Will's too nervous to look excited. He eyes the FOUR SUITS disembarking from nearby TOWN CARS.
WILL: I'm not good with this stuff. Jacobs puts a hand on Will's back, leads him inside.
JACOBS: You'll do fine. Just speak English. Keep the science simple.
CAROLINE: Okay. Back it out.
DONNIE: Your turn. Bright Eyes RUSHES FORWARD, HER HANDS GRIPPING THE BARS SO
FRANKLIN: Be right over - Donnie looks closely at Bright Eyes. There's something different in her face today. Rage? Force of will?
DONNIE: What's the matter with you?
WILL: ( AWKWARD )
DONNIE: Now Donnie's smashed up against the bars. Hard. The other apes begin to SCREECH. Donnie hasn't panicked quite yet, but he's about to.
CAROLINE: Hang on - Franklin struggles to hold onto Lucky as Caroline hurries over. He eyes the chimps in their cages - GOING CRAZY.
WILL: In the past, it's been impossible to target specific areas, both because of the Blood Brain Barrier - Jacobs stands, interrupting Will.
JACOBS: What Dr. Rodman has done is to invent a virus that can, for the first time, cross the membrane that protects the brain and deliver a genetic, therapeutic, payload.
WILL: ( trying to sell ) This 'payload' would directly affect the areas of memory, higher function - and, of course, the motherlode: intelligence. The board members stare, trying to comprehend.
BOARD MEMBER: ( deep breath here ) If Phase 2 goes as planned, we're INT. LAB - DAY She's breaking my hand!
WILL: ( deep breath here ) If Phase 2 goes as planned, we're INT. LAB - DAY She's breaking my hand!
DONNIE: She's breaking my hand!
CAROLINE: Let go, Bright Eyes! You're hurting him! She tries to help pull Donnie away.
FRANKLIN: Lucky no! Stop!
GUARD #1: Uh oh. Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN
GUARD #2: Hey, Len.? Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket. Donnie falls to the floor at Caroline's feet.
BOARD MEMBER: What about the safety of the virus?
WILL: Perfectly safe. We're using the most stable - A COMMOTION outside. Someone SCREAMS. Then a BLACK BLUR as LUCKY CRASHES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW.
NO!: Lucky turns on Will with a growl, lurching toward him and pinning him to the wall. It happens fast. The chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw, exposing DEADLY
WILL: Are they gone?
JACOBS: Long gone. Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway.
WILL: Did they say anything before they left? I mean, about Phase 2.
JACOBS: Look around you, for Christ sakes. We'll be lucky if we don't go to Will's gutted - devastated.
WILL: But we're so close.
JACOBS: You think you're the only one who's got something at stake here? I've got my own skin in this game!
WILL: What happened had nothing to do with the 112. ( desperate to clarify ) Take an already aggressive animal, make it smarter - you're going to get a potentially dangerous
JACOBS: What makes you so damned positive about that? ( pauses for emphasis ) What if this drug does things you don't understand? Are you going to take responsibility for that? Because I'm sure as hell not going Here Will hesitates.
WILL: They're apes.
JACOBS: This is what we're going to do: You're taking a sabbatical. I'll let the board handle the lawsuit. When this blows over I'll bring you back and we'll start over - we'll do it right this time. With mice. Tiny mice that can't hurt anybody. Will finds to his dismay that he's got nothing to say.
Â¢ FRANKLIN: Show you something, boss?
WILL: I don't work here anymore, I just put down fifteen animals, Dr. Rodman. The least you could do is give me a moment of your time. Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion. It's been a long, devastating day.
FRANKLIN: I just put down fifteen animals, Dr. Rodman. The least you could do is give me a moment of your time. Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion. It's been a long, devastating day.
WILL: of course.
FRANKLIN: They're all gone.
WILL: I'm sorry, Franklin. Genuinely What's he got to do to get the hell out of there? Franklin ignores him, steps inside Bright Eyes' cage. He moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket. At first Will doesn't understand what he's looking at. The lighting's dim and the thing's so small. But then IT MOVES AND WILL REALIZES HE'S LOOKING AT AN INFANT
FRANKLIN: They carry small. Must have been pregnant when they brought her in. Will tries to get his mind around the situation.
WILL: Who else knows about this?
FRANKLIN: No one.
WILL: You want me to take him?
FRANKLIN: He's an orphan now.
WILL: I could be thrown in jail. He's a chimpanzee who's been exposed to a possibly dangerous drug.
FRANKLIN: You don't believe that.
WILL: Doesn't matter what I believe.
FRANKLIN: Just for a couple days. Until I can find a sanctuary.
WILL: That's not possible.
FRANKLIN: I heard you outside, fighting to keep them alive.
WILL: I was talking about the work, my
FRANKLIN: she was just trying to protect him.
WILL: Bright Eyes - the mother. That's why she wouldn't let anyone into her cage. Will looks down at the helpless baby.
FRANKLIN: Bright Eyes - the mother. That's why she wouldn't let anyone into her cage. Will looks down at the helpless baby.
WILL: I'm sorry, Franklin - I'm sorry - but there's nothing I can do here. He's got to be put down like the Tell you what, Doc. ( producing a syringe ) I'm done for the day. So you be my Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will. It's quiet. Will can hear the baby's WHEEZY breath. He enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his little hands. Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's belly. but there's no way he can go through with this. Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who watches from outside the cage.

Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who watches from outside the cage.
WILL: Two days. Then you have to figure it out.
TEEN CASHIER: Hey man. Congratulations.
WILL: ( REALIZING )
IRENA: It's Friday night. I had a date.
WILL: I'm sorry - there was - She doesn't wait to hear his excuse, just moves down the walk, her footfalls pointed and angry.
WILL: It's okay. It's going to be okay. Awkwardly, he even rocks back and forth a little bit. Will looks down at the chimp, struggling for breath. The room fills with STEAM.
WILL: Please pass the ketchup. Caesar slides the ketchup to Will.
CAESAR: ( using American Sign
LANGUAGE ): You're welcome. NOTE: Whenever Caesar communicates he's signing and there will be subtitles.
LAB TECH: Is he going to turn left or The mouse turns left at the cone - and finds his way to a piece of cheese. Will does his best to hide the excitement blooming on his face.
WILL: There it is. Restored cognitive Same success rate as the primates.
LAB TECH: Same success rate as the primates.
Â¢ STEWART: He's right on target. Height. She checks Caesar's ears.
CAESAR: Dairy Queen.
WILL: After. Sit still.
STEWART: What about diet?
WILL: A healthy diet. Fruits, Ice cream. Will ignores him.
CAESAR: Ice cream. Will ignores him.
STEWART: What's he saying?
WILL: He's hungry. Caesar's angling to climb off the examining table. Will sends him a look - out it out.
STEWART: He seems extremely intelligent. How many words does Caesar sign? You know, the basics.
WILL: You know, the basics.
CAESAR: I've heard of apes learning up to a hundred and fifty words. Is he good with puzzles? Will hesitates.
STEWART: I've heard of apes learning up to a hundred and fifty words. Is he good with puzzles? Will hesitates.
WILL: He's pretty good.
STEWART: Well, Caesar's healthy, obviously happy. You're doing a great job with him. ( doesn't want to alarm ) But there is an anomaly I noticed.
WILL: Like what?
STEWART: When I was examining his eyes, I noticed a strange green His heart starts to pound.
WILL: His heart starts to pound.
STEWART: Green. Never.seen it before. She hands Will an OTOSCOPE.
WILL: No thanks.
STEWART: Carotid pulse is running a little For a human or a chimpanzee? First time he's seen her smile. It lights up her face.
WILL: For a human or a chimpanzee? First time he's seen her smile. It lights up her face.
STEWART: Gotta remember to eat.
WILL: Here's the hard part: you can't put a larger block on top of a smaller Caesar studies the puzzle.
IRENA: What's the best score?
WILL: Will looks over at Walter, who's staring at the wall.
IRENA: ( AMAZED )
WILL: ( eyes on Walter ) It was passed down from his mother.
WILL: ( into computer mic ) At age two Caesar appears to exceed his mother's aptitude. He signs over three hundred words. He exhibits no visible side effects from the therapy.
WILL: ( syringe in hand ) Dad. I've got something that's going to make you better. Will closes the door behind him. WE HEAR A RHYTHMIC SQUEAKING NOISE as we.
WILL: ( to someone offscreen ) You want turkey or ham?
TODD'S BUDDY: Check it. He wants to play. Thrilled at the contact, Caesar throws the ball to Todd. But Todd has an idea, and the idea makes him smile. Alice doesn't have a good feeling. She watches as her brother throws the ball to his Buddy OVER CAESAR'S HEAD.
TODD: Monkey in the middle. Todd's Buddy LAUGHS. Caesar LAUGHS too, although he's not sure what's funny.
WALTER: He won't go far.
WILL: He won't go far.
WALTER: You don't know that.
WILL: I do, Dad.
HUNSIKER: Hah! Hah - Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN HUNSIKER AND CAESAR. Caesar cowers behind him.
WILL: Hold on - it's okay - he's Your monkey came onto my property! Threatened my kids! By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate.
HUNSIKER: Your monkey came onto my property! Threatened my kids! By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate.
WILL: It won't happen again.
HUNSIKER: Damn right it won't happen again! I'll press charges if it does! Will holds Caesar close and hurries home.
STEWART: What does he do for fun? Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little thrown by the question.
WILL: Well we've got puzzles, games, a swing set.
STEWART: My guess is he needs more. More exercise, more space.
WILL: We'll work on that. Stewart continues examining Caesar. Will watches her listen to his heart. Closing her eyes for a moment, listening.
STEWART: I'm sorry, did you say something? He starts to try again - but the moment's gone.
WILL: No - nothing. Caesar meets Will's eyes, obviously disappointed. Stewart lingers a moment, certain she's missed something - but Will doesn't say more.
WALTER: Take him off the leash.
Â¢ WILL: There's a place up ahead.
WILL: Don't go far. Stay where I can see Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins flying from tree to tree. Will watches, nervous. But it's gratifying to see Caesar so happy. The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then another. The men follow. and discover CAESAR STANDING IN A
WALTER: Go ahead. Climb! The men sit down on a log, watching as Caesar swings from the branches. Free, elated. An animal in his element. Caesar begins climbing a redwood. Our view of him is obscured by the leaves. As his dark form ascends, Will and Walter become smaller and smaller down below.
WILL: Sorry to rush you - got to get home and check on Walter. They approach a WOMAN with a LARGE DOG on a leash - a GREAT DANE. The dog BARKS, lunging menacingly. The Woman struggles to control him.
WOMAN: ( INCREDULOUS )
WILL: Don't worry - he's harmless. Very The big dog keeps BARKING. Annoyed, Caesar finally turns and gives him a LARGE,
WILL: Where's Dr. Stewart?
S VETERINARIAN: She doesn't work here anymore.
WILL: Do you know where she went?
VETERINARIAN: I'm sorry - I don't. Will's deeply disappointed.
WILL: Come on. As Will drags Caesar off, the apes in the enclosure climb higher in the tree to watch. Suddenly they ALL BEGIN TO
WILL: Turn it around, Dad. You're using the wrong end. Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending. With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the old man, adjusting the spoon. Will watches. Heartbroken.
WILL: The drug's not staying ahead of the But we're still making progress, Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written all over his face.
JACOBS: But we're still making progress, Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written all over his face.
WILL: Sure. At this pace we'll get to trials by the time Hell freezes Jacobs - embarrassed in front of the Tech - pulls him aside.
JACOBS: This isn't graduate school - there's a procedure we have to adhere to.
WILL: It'll take forever. I need to start developing a primate version Jacobs looks at Will. He's known him a long time.
JACOBS: How's your father? Haven't seen him in a while.
WILL: This isn't about him.
JACOBS: He's worse, isn't he? Will wants to tell Jacobs the truth - he's tempted to tell him about Caesar, about Walter's treatment - but he can't.
WILL: ( EVASIVE )
WILL: ( into computer mic ) Caesar continues to maintain a high level of cognition. But Walter's disease has caught up to the neurogenesis treatment. Nearly all initial improvement has been Will stops recording. KICKS his desk in frustration.
CAESAR: Who Caesar.
WILL: What do you mean?
CAESAR: With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and tries to understand what Caesar wants from him.
WILL: Caesar is an ape.
CAESAR: No "what". "Who". Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual leap Caesar's taken.
WILL: Are you asking about your identity? That's abstract thought, Caesar. Caesar couldn't care less about 'abstract thought.'
CAESAR: Walter Will father. Will Caesar Will looks at the chimp - sees the intensity, the pain on his face. How to begin to answer?
WILL: I never knew your father, but your mother came to live here. This is where you were born.
CAESAR: Caesar mother?
WILL: She was very very smart. And she passed that onto you through her Caesar strains for a better view. Undoes his seatbelt.
CAESAR: Caesar go. Caesar see. Will locks the car door.
WILL: She's not here anymore. I'm sorry, Caesar - she died. That's when I brought you home to live with me and Walter. Caesar's getting worked up - he wants out of the car.
CAESAR: Caesar mother. Will grows concerned.
WILL: No. This is a bad place for you, Caesar. We're going to go now.
TV REPORTER: The Icarus crew is led by Commander Colonel George Taylor. This is his fifth space mission.
HUNSIKER: Look at the front of my car you stupid, stupid old man! You should be locked up! Your son's going to pay for that damage -
WALTER: Straddling Hunsiker, teeth bared, Caesar pounds him with his Help! Get him off -
HUNSIKER: Help! Get him off -
WALTER: Caesar. no. Stop! Walter grabs Caesar by the shoulders, tries to pull him back. But Caesar's too carried away by his rage - he shrugs the old man off his back. Then he grabs one of Hunsiker's hands and BITES OFF THE
HUNSIKER: Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE
WALTER: Caesar hesitates. Blood dripping down his chin, he looks over his shoulder and meets Walter's eyes.
HUNSIKER: Please no. Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph. But then he sees something across the street that abruptly pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY -
REPORTER: The defense claimed the chimp was merely trying to protect its owner from perceived aggression. FOOTAGE OF WILL LEAVING A COURTHOUSE, avoiding News Crews. Jacobs sits forward, turns up the volume.
WILL: We're visiting a place called "The Ranch". They have animals.
CAESAR: Real animals?
WILL: You bet. Apes. Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans. Caesar GRUNTS, excited.
CAESAR: Will sad?
WILL: What? No, I'm fine.
CAESAR: Where animals?
WILL: Inside, I think.
WILL: You must be Mr. Landon.
MR. LANDON: Nice to meet you, Caesar. This is Dodge, helps me run the place.
WILL: I've been telling Caesar about the animals you have here. How much fun it is.
MR. LANDON: Yes, we have a big play center where the chimpanzees like to Want to see the play center? Caesar nods. Absolutely.
MR. LANDON: What do you think, Caesar? Want to give it a try? Trying to mask his growing dread, Will removes Caesar's Go ahead. He watches Caesar - unsuspecting - move through AN OPEN, GATE-
WILL: Go ahead. He watches Caesar - unsuspecting - move through AN OPEN, GATE-
WILL: It's okay, Caesar. It's going to be okay. The words are for him as much as Caesar.
DODGE: That's about it for visiting hours. Will shoots him a look of daggers.
MR. LANDON: What Dodge means is, in our experience, longer you drag out the leave-taking, harder it is. On both of you. Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth.
WILL: I'm sorry to trick you this way, but you would never have agreed. I was afraid they'd hurt you if they forced you -
MR. LANDON: He'll be fine. Will gives Caesar a last, long look. The pain in his eyes is matched only by Caesar's. WE STAY WITH CAESAR as Will forces himself to walk away. Caesar's SHRIEKS build. The SURROUNDING APES chime in.a
DODGE: Caesar. Hey. I can get you out. Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING.
DODGE: Caesar - over here. Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for salvation-but AS SOON AS HE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD, HE
RODNEY: Look at that! Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage.
DODGE: One thing you can count on: Long as there are humans on this earth, you'll always be a monkey in a The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards. Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his back as a shield. The water BLAST is relentless. Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the What about his clothes? Might cause problems with the other apes.
RODNEY: What about his clothes? Might cause problems with the other apes.
DODGE: Leave 'em.
JACOBS: You've been gone a week.
WILL: I was sick.
JACOBS: Too sick to return my calls? You know it was a funny thing, but I was watching the news and they started talking about a seven-year- old chimpanzee that went nuts - and all of a sudden, there you were on the TV. A seven year old chimp, raised since birth. The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his voice. Neither man cares.
WILL: He's the son of chimp 4. And he's smart. Off-the-charts smart. Because of the 112. The genetic therapy was passed in utero - from the mother to the son. Without a single negative side-effect.
JACOBS: Aside from biting off a man's He was protecting my father. The same way his mother was protecting We've had this conversation already. We knew the 112 was making the apes smart -
WILL: He was protecting my father. The same way his mother was protecting We've had this conversation already. We knew the 112 was making the apes smart -
JACOBS: We've had this conversation already. We knew the 112 was making the apes smart -
WILL: ( INTERRUPTING )
JACOBS: You're out of your mind. Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit there. And Jacobs is undeniably, voraciously curious.
WILL: Don't you want to know if it Jacobs can't resist.
JACOBS: Did it?
WILL: It was miraculous. Unquestionable adult neurogenesis - development of fresh nerve tissue.
JACOBS: You told me he was failing.
WILL: It's just like with the mice. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, you need to keep it at bay â¢ - you need boosters.
JACOBS: Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
WILL: I couldn't risk losing him.
JACOBS: The ape? Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity.
WILL: The ape? Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity.
JACOBS: The ape? Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity.
WILL: We've discovered a safe treatment. It's the payday you've been waiting for. I'll recreate the primate version of 112 for you.
JACOBS: You're giving me conditions? I could have you arrested for what you've done.
WILL: But you won't - you need me to build the drug. Here's what I need: I want you to get Caesar How the hell can I do that?
JACOBS: ( THROWN )
WILL: However they do things in your part of the world. Get attorneys into it. Write checks. Slip cash into the right pockets. ( pausing for emphasis ) Make it happen.
VOICE: Stewart stands over him. The light shines'behind her head.
STEWART: Do you remember me? I'm Dr. She hands him a cup of water with a straw.
DODGE: oh, hey Doc.
STEWART: That chimp needs protection. Dodge's face falls.
DODGE: ( A LIE )
STEWART: Can't you see how sensitive he is? How intelligent?
DODGE: Yeah, no, he's a real smart I want him moved to the orangutan house. He'll be safe there until we re-introduce him to the group.
STEWART: I want him moved to the orangutan house. He'll be safe there until we re-introduce him to the group.
DODGE: I'm sorry, since when do volunteer animal doctors make the rules around here?
STEWART: Please. Just do it.
DODGE: Whatever you say, doc. Dodge returns to stacking the chow.
VIRUS TECHNICIAN: Dr. Rodman - I think there's been a Will's been waiting for this observation - he's surprised it took so long to come up.
WILL: That's why we're using it. We need the drug quickly.
VIRUS TECHNICIAN: But. isn't it risky? I mean, at this rate of propagation, we greatly increase the possibility of mutations that are out of our control. It's a highly unstable -
WILL: I appreciate your concern - but it's going to be fine. We plan on taking precautions. The Technician pauses, not entirely satisfied. But Will's look tells him the conversation is over.
STEWART: Sorry to drop in on you like this. The clinic at the zoo gave me your address but they didn't have a phone number -
WILL: ( RECOVERING )
WILL: Can I - you want a cup of coffee or No - thanks. I just wanted to let you know that I've seen Caesar. Seen Caesar?
STEWART: No - thanks. I just wanted to let you know that I've seen Caesar. Seen Caesar?
WILL: I volunteer once a week at The Is he alright? She hesitates, wanting to be honest but not alarming.
STEWART: I volunteer once a week at The Is he alright? She hesitates, wanting to be honest but not alarming.
WILL: Is he alright? She hesitates, wanting to be honest but not alarming.
STEWART: Yeah. He had a rough start, but things should get smoother from now In the other room, Walter and his Aide become visible. Will follows Stewart's curious gaze.
WILL: That's my dad. He's not doing too Oh. Sorry.
STEWART: Oh. Sorry.
WILL: Thank you. I appreciate that. Awkward beat.
STEWART: Well. If you give me your number I'll let you know from time to time how things are going -
WILL: Let's grab a drink. Takes her by surprise. Maybe takes him by surprise too. She's happy he asked.
STEWART: Love to.
DODGE: Want a beer? The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away.
WILL: There you are! I heard what Home now. Caesar home. He tugs Will away from Dodge.
CAESAR: ( SIGNING )
WILL: I'm going to get you out of here, but not today. I'm working on it. Caesar's face falls.
CAESAR: ( SIGNING )
WILL: ( kills him to say it ) Not yet. I can't yet. Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here. First incredulous - then outraged - Caesar turns away and
DODGE: ( loud enough for Will ) No place like home, huh monkey boy?
WILL: Caesar - come back here! He watches Caesar's retreating back, Dodge trotting alongside him. Realizes Caesar's nearly breaking into a run.
WILL: You son of a bitch. Dodge scrabbles to his feet, wipes the blood from his nose.
DODGE: That was not a smart thing to do. Dodge is clearly much tougher, stronger than Will, but Will's too angry to care.
WILL: If I find out Caesar's been hurt, if he's mistreated in any way, I swear I'll have you brought up on Dodge looks towards Landon's house, restrains himself.
DODGE: That wild-eyed chimp isn't yours any more. He's mine now. The truth of the statement is worse than any punch.
WILL: Forget jail. I'll come back and kill you.
STEWART: How's your arm? Mind if I take a Stewart rummages in her MEDICAL BAG. CAESAR WATCHES AS SHE PULLS OUT A PAIR OF SCISSORS, cuts off his bandages.
DODGE: No way. As she walks to Dodge, CAESAR GLANCES INTO HER MEDICAL BAG.
STEWART: What are you going to do? Use a cattle prod on me?
DODGE: If you're into that kind of thing.
STEWART: I'm safer with him than I am with Answer's no.
DODGE: Answer's no.
STEWART: I can't take you. ( glancing at Dodge ) Maybe another time.
WILL: Which one of you wants chocolate. Chimpanzees stare back at him, giving him nothing. NOISE FROM BEHIND. Will turns. Down the row, A CHIMPANZEE
EVANS: ( THROUGH MASK )
STEWART: You actually punched him?
WILL: I did. She thinks it's funny.
STEWART: I've been wanting to do that since the day I met him.
WILL: I don't advise it. My hand's killing me.
STEWART: Here. Let me help you out. She begins feeding him the Chinese food. He puts down his I'm going to get him out of there.
WILL: I'm going to get him out of there.
STEWART: I know you are.
WILL: And I'm going to get my dad back INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT Caesar tapes sticks together. WE SEE that he's created a THREE-FOOT LONG "ARM". He tapes the scissors firmly to its end, finger holes sticking out. Finished. Silently he moves to the edge of the cage. USING THE
MAURICE: Happy gorilla. Caesar's shocked.
CAESAR: Signing orangutan.
MAURICE: Maurice circus orangutan.
CAESAR: More ape sign?
MAURICE: No. Maurice alone. They HEAR DODGE'S WHEELBARROW APPROACH.
CAESAR: Careful. Stupid human no like smart ape. Dodge begins shoveling primate chow into the troughs. Maurice and Caesar stop signing and blend in.
WILL: Hold him steady! Evans tightens the straps on Koba's flailing arm.
EVANS: Yeah. I'm good.
WILL: You can't put larger blocks on top of smaller ones. ( pointing to right side ) Move the stack from here to here. Koba takes the puzzle and ROTATES IT 180 DEGREES CLOCKWISE,
FRANKLIN: You wanna know if I think the 113's making him nuts.
WILL: I know he's smart. But there's something else, something worrisome. He challenges me. Taunts me. Will looks toward us, toward the bars.
FRANKLIN: What you're seeing has nothing to do with the 113, Doc. The apes're just like us - they're complex. Some are loyal, some are selfish, some have a good sense of humor. And some are born rotten. Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of view, from inside the cage. Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his â¢ face frame the two men across the room.
GUARD: ( OPENING GATE )
EVANS: Actually I'm not feeling too good.
GUARD: You know what: Whiskey, lemon, honey and a cup of hot water. Never fails.
EVANS: Thanks - I'm on it. Evans drives off.
RODNEY: Still won't eat, won't come out.
DODGE: I can fix that. Dodge drags the hose to Rocket's cage.
MAURICE: Why cookie Rocket?
CAESAR: Need strong. All apes strong.
MAURICE: No understand. Caesar grabs a small twig off the tree and BREAKS IT.
CAESAR: He breaks another twig.
WILL: Someone's sleeping late today - Will opens the door - and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.
RODNEY: Sorry - can't get him to come out. He won't budge.
WILL: He knows I'm here?
RODNEY: I told him. Will brushes by Rodney, heads for the cages.
WILL: Caesar - please! I've got something to tell you -
Â¢: WE FIND CAESAR deep out of sight in the orangutan cage. He' s heard Will's words. Will waits. Caesar's not coming out.
NEWSCASTER: Captain Taylor and his crew are navigating the ship around the dark side of Mars. Communication is expected to be reestablished -
WILL: I was too late. She puts the photo down, cuddles against him.
STEWART: You tried. You worked really hard. Walter knew that.
WILL: Wasn't good enough though, was it. ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH. It shows a younger Walter and his two teenage sons.
FRANKLIN: Just checking in. You didn't show up at work today.
MAURICE: Where go?
CAESAR: Find Mother.
DODGE: Rise and shine, assholes. The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in the common area.
CAGE ): You sly son of a bitch. How'd you do that? Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds it in front of him. He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage.
CAESAR: ( with his voice ) STUNNED SILENCE. THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING. Dodge is thunderstruck - nearly loses his balance. Caesar has spoken. Actually uttered a word. Maurice, Rocket, Buck, and all the apes stare, dumbfounded, trying to comprehend what has just happened. And then. they go nuts.
WILL: INTERCUT WITH JACOBS AT THE LAB. The animal handler - Franklin - was killed last night. In the primate Franklin's dead?
JACOBS: The animal handler - Franklin - was killed last night. In the primate Franklin's dead?
WILL: Franklin's dead?
JACOBS: Something very powerful broke his neck. Snapped it in two.
WILL: Could it have been one of our All our apes are accounted for - â¢ secured in their cages. But here's the kicker: One of our security guards swears he chased a chimpanzee off the grounds last Will - with growing dread - looks out the window at Caesar's Where in the hell did that chimp come from?!

MR. LANDON: The Ranch. Landon speaking.
MR. LANDON: She said that -
STEWART: ( ON PHONE )
WILL: You go get help.
STEWART: Not a way in the world. I'm coming with you.
STEWART: Oh my God. I'm calling 911.. Will picks up Landon's BINOCULARS, moves to the front window. HE SEES: Debris everywhere. Apes free, wandering. DODGE, LANDON and RODNEY BATTERED AND IN CAGES.
WILL: Will lowers the binoculars as Stewart rushes in. She's It's going to take them at least half an hour to get here. He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an empty cookie bag, but Will's able to put his hands on a couple of stray COOKIES. He has an idea. Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON.
STEWART: It's going to take them at least half an hour to get here. He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an empty cookie bag, but Will's able to put his hands on a couple of stray COOKIES. He has an idea. Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON.
WILL: I'm going to kill him.
STEWART: ( HORRIFIED )
WILL: He's dangerous.
STEWART: You're wrong - he can't have been the one who killed that man -
WILL: There is no other explanation. A BLACK SHADOW passes by the window. Then another. Stewart turns. Now there's another. They're surrounded. She SCREAMS. Will barricades the back door with a table. Chimpanzees at every window BANGING ON THE GLASS, wanting in.
WILL: Caesar! I need to talk to you! Dodge, Rodney and Landon watch as Will and Stewart are pushed into the cage next door.
DODGE: Welcome to the mad house.
STEWART: I called Animal Control - they'll be here soon -
WILL: ( through the bars ) I just want to talk to you!
DODGE: Well this'll be interesting because your freak'll talk back.
RODNEY: Dodge thinks he spoke to him.
DODGE: He did! He said the word "no" - right to my face.
WILL: What do you mean?
DODGE: He can talk.
STEWART: That's impossible.
DODGE: Then he must have a voicebox in his ass, because I heard him! Caesar walks up. COOKIE is ready.
WILL: Caesar - people are coming. People with guns. You've got to make the apes go back in their cages.
CAESAR: ( SIGNING )
WILL: I brought this for you. Caesar eyes the cookie but doesn't take it.
CAESAR: ( SIGNING )
WILL: You went to the lab last night. I know it was you. Caesar doesn't deny it.
CAESAR: ( SIGNING )
WILL: ( SIGNING )
CAESAR: ( SIGNING )
WILL: Don't walk away. We need to talk.
CAESAR: ( VOICE STRAINING )
VOICE: They could be spread out all over the County by now. Will and Stewart - released from the cages - speak to OFFICER HUFFS. Dodge, Rodney, and Landon huddle nearby.
WILL: No - they'll stick together.
DODGE: ( INTERRUPTING )
HUFFS: There's a leader?
DODGE: ( POINTING )
WILL: His name is Caesar. If I can reason with him, I know I can put an end to this.
HUFFS: Reason with him? Huffs thinks he's nuts. He turns, starts toward his squad car. Will follows, Stewart on his heel.
WILL: You don't understand - this chimp is smart - he'll listen to me
HUFF: ( to nearby JUNIOR OFFICER ) Get on the horn with every agency you can think of! We've got to track down these monkeys before they do major damage! The Junior Officer - GRANGER - heads for his car. Dodge You need me riding with you. I've got experience with these animals. ( eye on Will ) I can point out the one you want.
DODGE: You need me riding with you. I've got experience with these animals. ( eye on Will ) I can point out the one you want.
OFFICER: ( handing Jacobs a card ) If you think of anything else, this is where I can be reached - A RUMBLING SOUND from behind. They turn to see a RANCH APE ARMY heading their way. Shocked, they leap out of the way as best they can.
Â¢: The apes STAMPEDE past them and SWARM INTO THE LAB.
OFFICER: We have a situation at Gen-Sys Laboratory! Approximately two dozen apes, gorillas, I don't know what the hell they are - AUDIBLE CHAOS from inside the lab. YELLING, SCREAMING,
WILL: The lab.
HUFFS: You know anything about this?
WILL: That's where I work.
OFFICER #1: Here they come!
OFFICER #2: There's more of them!
JACOBS: ( REALIZING )
HOFFS: Any idea where they're headed? Will sees Dodge joining SHARPSHOOTERS in another helicopter below. He doesn't like it.
WILL: They were seen heading north from the lab - let's start with that.
HOFFS: They were seen heading north from the lab - let's start with that.
GIRL: OVER HER SHOULDER WE SEE A CHIMPANZEE HEADING OUR WAY. Then another. And another.
MOTHER: Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up and puts her down out of harm's way. Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where he's going. SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase.
HUFFS: You see them?
WILL: No, I can't see -
STEWART: Oh my god. Seated next to Will, she draws him to her window. FAR BELOW: it looks like a BLACK LOCUST moving through the urban sprawl - chased by numerous Squad Cars - directly behind them, along parallel streets. She realizes something.
WILL: He's going to release the apes. Looking to his left, Will sees a sniper try to get shots off - but hesitate. The apes are too interspersed with fleeing PATRONS.
WRANGLER: What the hell am I supposed to do when they get here?! An APE WRANGLER screams into a wall phone at the Ape Enclosure. The ZOO APES are agitated and anxious - they know something's coming. Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers, turns to see Caesar and his apes. Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth. The Wrangler understands - fumbles for his keys.
DODGE: That's him! The one with the white on his shoulder! A SNIPER takes aim at Caesar - the BULLET RICOCHETS OFF THE
TAXI DRIVER: Where to, my man?
JACOBS: 24 Marigold.
TAXI DRIVER: Want me to turn down the air?
JACOBS: ( DESPONDENT ) CUT TO:
WILL: They're going to Muir Woods. ( turning to Huffs ) I'm sure of it. He doesn't want to hurt anyone - he's just trying to get the apes out of the City!
HUFFS: ( INTO HEADSET )
WILL: No - let them through!
STEWART: ( ALARMED )
WILL: No - not him.
HUFFS: ( INTO HEADSET )
ABOVE BRIDGE: Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at the MAIN CABLE - the thick one running along the top. They start scampering and swinging north, the FOG MOVING AND
OFFICER: They're all around us! Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH -
BAM!: Rocket's hit in the back! He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE
AERIAL VIEW: As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON
Â¢: again, his face red with the tension of what's to come.
OFFICER #1: We can't gas the forest! The slightest wind would take it over to Tiburon.
OFFICER #2: Well it'll take us months to find them in there.
OFFICER #3: Not to mention rounding them all Will approaches the group.
WILL: I know where they are. The Officers look at him. Who the hell is this guy? Huffs - embarrassed - gestures toward Will.
HUFFS: This man owns one of the chimps.
WILL: His name is Caesar. I think he'll listen to me. If he comes out, the other apes will follow. Sounds pretty far-fetched.
OFFICER #1: You think you know where to find this monkey? Will starts to correct him - lets it go.
WILL: I do. I used to bring him here. The Officers look at each other.
OFFICER #1: We don't have a lot of options. Let's give it a try.
WILL: But you have to promise me - if I can get them out, you'll take them peacefully. Tranquilize them, cage them. No killing. Whatever it takes.
HUFFS: Whatever it takes.
WILL: You think this is a bad idea?
STEWART: He thought so.
WILL: I know. Got to try, right? I owe him that much. Will kisses her. Heads off down the path. Then he pauses, turns to look at her.
STEWART: ( can't quite hear him ) Will waves it off - never mind. the woods.
HUFFS: Follow me. Stewart double-takes, sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL'S
STEWART: Hang on a second. ( to nearest Officer ) Where are they going?
WILL: Caesar! . He keeps walking, almost there. A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN
CAESAR: Humans coming.
WILL: No. I'm alone. Will pauses - there's so much he wants to say.
CAESAR: Will want Caesar dead.
WILL: I thought you had killed a man. But I should have known better. Caesar's face is unreadable. Will can't tell what he's I want you to know that all of this is my fault. My responsibility.
CAESAR: Will leave.
WILL: I won't -
CAESAR: Will leave now.
WILL: No. I'm staying with you. Caesar pushes him. Will staggers backwards, falls down. At that moment, HUFFS and his ARMY step into the clearing. Huffs takes aim at Caesar.
NO!: HE RUSHES CAESAR JUST AS HUFFS PULLS THE TRIGGER. THE BLAST OF THE GUN SHATTERS THE FOREST'S SILENCE. AT THAT SAME MOMENT APES DROP FROM THE TREES IT'S AN AMBUSH - a COUNTERATTACK. Huffs and his men are taken by surprise. SHOTS are fired, but not fast enough.
TAXI DRIVER: Where to, my man? It's the Taxi Driver with the mustache - THE SAME ONE THAT
HUNSIKER: SFO. International terminal.
TAXI DRIVER: You got it. The Driver COUGHS as he pulls away. Light sweat on his forehead - he doesn't look too good.
