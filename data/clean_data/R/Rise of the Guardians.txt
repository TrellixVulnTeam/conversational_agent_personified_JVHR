PITCH: A neutral party. Then I'm going to ignore you. But, you must be used to that by now.
BUNNYMUND: Pitch! You shadow sneaking rat- bag! Come here! Bunny goes after Pitch, but he disappears and reemerges on an opposite column. Tooth spots him, grabs one of Bunny's boomerangs and flies at Pitch in a rage.
TOOTH: Pitch looks at Tooth with a smile and before she can reach him, a huge Nightmare darts out of hiding and rears up at her. Tooth falls back. Baby Tooth hides in Jack's tunic.

BUNNYMUND: It's the accent, isn't it? North comes up from behind with Tooth at his side. They turn toward Bunny, marveling at the sight of Sophie, fast sleep. It's touching. Bunny's face softens, as if remembering a distant memory.

JACK: ( under his breath ) As I can Jack looks down and sees the tooth drawers from Tooth's Palace. Mounds of them heaped to the ceiling. And inside the drawers are the missing baby teeth. He drops down to a mound and begins rummaging through the drawers, looking at the names on the boxes. In an instant he forgets his duties, and the fairies, and the Guardians and everything except those teeth, and the chance to finally get his memory back. The cavern suddenly goes darker than it already was. Jack finally looks up, as a shadow of Pitch crawls up a nearby PITCH ( O.S. ) Looking for something? Jack swings around with his staff, shooting off a blast of ice, but Pitch isn't there. Jack takes off, following the sound of Pitch's cackle as it echoes throughout the chamber. Jack rounds a corner as he sees Pitch's shadow glide across the walls into a shadowed corridor.

PITCH: You're afraid of disappointing Well let me ease your mind about one thing. They'll never accept you. Not really. The shadows have overcome Jack.
JACK: ( trying to scramble away ) Stop it! Stop it! Almost reluctantly, the shadows back away and Pitch appears before Jack.

JACK: Jack, enraged, can't believe what he's seeing. Pitch lifts the staff, and breaks it over his knee, cracking it in two. Light EXPLODES from the staff and terror comes into Jack's eyes, clutching his chest as if in pain. Suddenly, Pitch sends a burst of Nightmare sand, blasting Jack and slamming him into the iceberg wall behind him. As the ice cracks, Jack comes loose and falls forward into the chasm below. Pitch looks down into the ice fissure chuckling. He throws the broken shards of Jack's staff down into the crevasse and casually walks away, disappearing on the horizon.
JACK: Baby Tooth! He pulls himself to her and cradles her in his hands.
JACK: You alright? Baby Tooth nods, but she's hurt, and cold. Jack does his best to shield her from the cold.

Jack reaches slowly down and removes the second of two rudimentary ice-skates, leaving him BAREFOOT on the surface of a familiar FROZEN pond. And now we see what he sees, a girl of about FOUR ( with an uncanny resemblance to Jamie's sister Sophie ) stands in her skates, rooted to the spot. A spider's web of cracks emanates from where she stands.
JACK'S SISTER: Jack, I'm scared. CRACCKKK! The ice below her splinters more. She wobbles as it starts to separate.
