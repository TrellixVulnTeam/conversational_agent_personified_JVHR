LENNY COLE: It's nice to see you Uri.
URI: ( there is a pause ) I can see we are very much alike you and I Lenny. We like to get things ( beat ) What's it going to cost me?
LENNY COLE: First, let me make clear how much we can help you benefit from this deal. With out me, it will take you five to ten years to get the permission to erect your arena. Second, with Government policy as it so stands we both know it's unlikely that you'd ever get that consent. Thirdly, in legal fees, transactions and building consent, you'd be paying 6 to 12 million without any real guarantee of that result.

ROCKER: I need the dry ice Mickey, I need the dry ice. My show just doesn't work without it.
MICKEY: ( hand over the receiver ) If you told me yesterday you needed dry ice, I would have gotten you the driest ice the world could offer, but you didn't ask for no dry ice. You asked for two cases of Johnny Walker black label and four ladies of the pole and I got them for you didn't I?
ROCKER: Yes you did I do confess, but Mickey, you're the manager and I am the rocker. You've got on the managers hat, now pluck something out of it.
MICKEY: My hat is deep and full of magic. I got rabbits, handkerchiefs, and ladies of the pole drinking Black Label. I got smoke machines, bubble machines, I even got love marines and still the hat goes deeper, but..there ain't no mother fuckin dry ice.
ROMAN: Have you read this?

ROMAN: Johnny Story singer extraordinaire, fell off a boat, they say. Missing, assumed dead, they say.

ROMAN: How many rock stars by the name of Johnny Story do you think there are in this universe Mickey?
MICKEY: The only thing he's fallen off is his junkies spoon, he's no deader than the suit you're wearing now. He'll be gearing himself up somewhere happy as clam in a fisherman's net. Rockers like that never die, they just wither and give me pain.
LENNY COLE: Johnny Story singer extraordinare, fell off a boat, missing, assumed I don't know what to say Lenny.
ARCHY: I don't know what to say Lenny.
