LEE: That was my CD. Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
CARTER: Did you see the way those girls drove off? I did you a favor.
LEE: Those girls drove off because of you.
CARTER: All I did was invite them for a drink.
LEE: You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
CARTER: ( checking Chinese-English I said that? Which word was "goat?" Lee picks up his CD case.
LEE: You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
CARTER: Don't be giving me attitude, Lee. I've been here three days and we haven't done shit. We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl. I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
LEE: Mu-shu? You're hungry?

LEE: Any leads?
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN: ( beat ) We think it's Ricky Tan. If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
LEE: It's my responsibility. Lee hangs up the cell phone.
CARTER: What was that? Did you just pick up a case? Did we just take another damn case on my vacation? Lee smiles at Carter.
LEE: Of course not. My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight. Big Don't be messing with me, Lee. I will kick your ass. I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

CARTER: Take this. It's a Magnum. You can fold it in half. Carter dances through the door, Lee follows.
LEE: I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
CARTER: Blend in? I'm two feet taller than everyone here. Where you going?
LEE: Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to the bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.
CARTER: How you boys doing tonight? The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the OLD MAN continues to sing.
LEE: ( whispering from side of stage ) Carter, get off that stage!
CARTER: Are you kidding, they love me. I'm a star, Lee. A god to these people! Carter resumes singing, really getting down. Moonwalking to the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF.
LEE: This is a gangster bar, we're here I knew you were lying.
CARTER: I knew you were lying.
LEE: I'm sorry.
CARTER: Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun. Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
LEE: No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is. We must tread softly and keep our ears Tread softly? Who taught you how to roost a bar?
CARTER: Tread softly? Who taught you how to roost a bar?
LEE: Carter, you don't understand. These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads. Part of the most deadly gang in China.
CARTER: Man, are you crazy? You think that scares me? I'm from L.A. We invented gangs. We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it. We get royalties from other gangs. Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
LEE: No. You are a civilian. In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
CARTER: You mean Tito. We had Toto for dinner last night. Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.
LEE: You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
CARTER: Shit. C'mon, get up here and help me Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage. More looks from the Chinese as Carter speaks, Lee translating.
CARTER: Stop! LAPD! Lee takes off and chases them on foot.
CARTER: Hang on, Lee. I'm coming. Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding. NOT EVEN CLOSE. He backs up he's gonna take a running start! ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS. They all tear off the LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off. The clatter of wood against wood as they beat at each other. Wrestling over his pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge. BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY to pull himself up. Just as he gets his chin above the bar. snap! It BREAKS and he drops. Then. WHAM! WHAM! The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of CARTER. HE takes one look at their pain.
CARTER: ( out of breath ) Freeze! Nobody move! Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below. Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li. She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE
ROOF!: He falls along the side of the building. He manages to grab the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.
LEE: Try to land on your feet. Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.
CARTER: I can't believe I flew ten-thousand miles for this shit. The POLE BREAKS
CARTER: You lied to me.
LEE: I'm sorry.
CARTER: You're sorry. I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry. Just take me No time. There was an explosion at the American Embassy today two American translators were killed. Carter takes this in. Can't believe his own bad luck.
LEE: No time. There was an explosion at the American Embassy today two American translators were killed. Carter takes this in. Can't believe his own bad luck.
CARTER: So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew up the Embassy?
CARTER: I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit. There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
LEE: This won't take long. Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES.
MASTER FU: Dragon kick! Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD.
LEE: ( bowing, humbled ) Yes, Master. While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12 YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.
CARTER: I was watching you kids. My name is Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree black belt. At least that's what I tell the girls at the Holiday Health Spa where I work out. Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no Let me give you kids some tips. The key to Kung Fu is the follow through. Why don't you stand up. THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction. Carter continues to throw Go ahead, kick me, hit me. I'll show you how to block. Come on, stand up, give me your best shot try to kick right to my head. The kids still don't move. Carter, working up a sweat from shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the HOLY BUDDHA behind him a mistake. He swings back around to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him flying back onto the mat. He looks around and sees ALL of the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION.
LEE: I need your help, Master. I'm seeking a man who used to train with you. He's become a killer - the worst kind of Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a .he kills for money. In the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over Carter from all sides.

LEE: How do I find Ricky Tan? AGAIN IN THE B.G., Carter and the flying kids go zipping by in the other direction, disappear O.S. Master Fu pats the SOIL around a struggling plant.
MASTER FU: A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.

MASTER FU: It's a massage parlor downtown. "Heaven on Earth." You will find your answers Lee bows to Master Fu, slowly turns to walk back down the Wait! Put a c-note in the jar. Lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway. Master Fu walks over and takes the cash.
CARTER: And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold. Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
LEE: Carter.you ready to have some fun!?
LEE: Just follow my lead and act like a I am a tourist.
CARTER: I am a tourist.

HOSTESS: ( to Lee ) Your friend have big appetite. ( handing ROBES to Lee and Please put these on and wait upstairs in the quiet room.
CARTER: Now I'm on vacation. I knew you'd come through, Lee. LEE doesn't respond. LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM. A man who radiates a unique blend of sophistication and brutality.
LEE: Over there that's Ricky Tan.
CARTER: That's Ricky Tan? He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
LEE: This is a very dangerous man.
CARTER: I'm a dangerous man. You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
LEE: I'm calling for back up! Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits. Carter looks at RICKY TAN sitting quietly in his chair with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees. Carter makes a decision, gets up and walks towards him.
CARTER: Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over for you. Get up. Tan looks up for a moment, a smile.
RICKY TAN: I'm busy at the moment.
CARTER: I said get on your feet!
RICKY TAN: I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend. Enjoying your visit?
CARTER: I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm and don't let the robe fool you. This is the only color they had left. Now get up! Tan laughs, goes back to his laptop. CARTER GRABS THE LAPTOP from Ricky and throws it across the room - SHATTERING IT against the wall. Ricky glances at his men who are seated around the room waiting to move.
RICKY TAN: Lee, I've missed you, brother. I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
LEE: You must come with me for questioning.
CARTER: Let's go. I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
RICKY TAN: I don't think so. A nod of Ricky Tan's head, and TEN LARGE MEN in robes and towels spring out of reclining chairs menacingly facing Lee and Carter. A beat.
CARTER: I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
RICKY TAN: It's no problem. But I must excuse myself, inspector.
CARTER: That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted. Tan bows to Lee and Carter.
RICKY TAN: Congratulations. And good day. As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him. But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN. Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off. The man covers his naked body. Lee is grabbed by one of the other henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight all the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel, his robe, or some other found object. Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men flying back grabbing a towel of one of them.
CARTER: ( ref: his privates ) Damn! No wonder you're pissed off. Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of the men's punches. In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed he flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind. Momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind two men throwing him out the front door. Carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over their shoulders.
CARTER: Goddamn you got a small ass.
LEE: Don't look at my ass!
PANDEMONIUM: The station is packed with Americans FBI AGENTS, SECRET SERVICE. they've set up shop right in the middle of the SUPERINDENDENT CHIN is arguing with SPECIAL AGENT STERLING, a 50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN: This is still Hong Kong.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN: Chief Inspector Lee will brief your No. He will report to me. Do we understand each other? SUDDENLY ALL EYES turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen. Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash can lid, Carter using a red construction cone.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN: ( humiliated ) That is.Chief Inspector Lee. The detective in charge of our Put a diaper on him, Chin. I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
LEE: Where are you going?
CARTER: Back to Heaven on Earth. I need my damn passport back. I'm going home.
LEE: Fine. Go home. Who needs you.
CARTER: Why you mad at me? You needed back-up, so I backed you up. I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
LEE: Stop! I'm sick of your bullshit!
CARTER: My bullshit? I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
LEE: It's my job!
CARTER: You're pathetic, man. When's the last time you had some fun? When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
LEE: I have plenty of dates.
CARTER: Really? When's the last time you had some Mu-shu Let's hear it, Lee, when was it? Year of the rat?
LEE: You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
CARTER: And you ain't black! The two men look at each other for a long BEAT. Lee quickly walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - DAY Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk. Chin stands in the back.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN: Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
LEE: The Secret Service? Why?
STERLING: What I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room. The men who were killed yesterday were not American translators. They were undercover U.S. customs agents trying to break a Triad smuggling ring. We don't know what they're transporting out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it got the agents killed.
LEE: How can we help?
STERLING: Stay the hell out of our way.
LEE: I can get to Ricky Tan.
STERLING: We know all about Tan. That's why we're leaving him out there as bait. We think this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads.
CARTER: Captain, you're gonna have to speak up. I'm on a car phone!
CAPTAIN DIEL: Is it true, Carter? Are you in Hong Kong right now?
CARTER: Hong Kong? I'm not in Hong Kong. I'm in Hollywood right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station. How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
CAPTAIN DIEL: It's nine-thirty in the morning.
CARTER: Did I say dinner? I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
CAPTAIN DIEL: Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter? I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
CARTER: Two hundred cops? Was Mario Sanchez there? He owes me money.
CAPTAIN DIEL: I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it. Do you know why?
CARTER: Is it because of the hookers, sir? You tell them there's no crime in being No, Carter. The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong. And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
CAPTAIN DIEL: No, Carter. The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong. And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
CARTER: Sir, I'm working on a big case over here and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor. Captain, you there? Hello? Shit! As Carter walks out the DOOR, he brushes past HU LI, who is standing in the hallway disguised as a FED EX DELIVERY PERSON. Carter checks her out as he exits.
CARTER: How you doing? Can you direct me to the Heaven on Earth massage parlor? The OLD WOMAN stares at Carter, starts motioning to her CAGES filled with birds.
LEE: Carter! CARTER!
CARTER: How you doing? I'm looking for Heaven on Earth. The man stares at Carter, watches as he pulls out his:
MAN: You wish to spank my sister with a ping pong paddle?
CARTER: No man, I was just asking.
MAN: Wait here. I'll go see if she's awake. As the man walks into his store, Carter runs off. Carter strolls back INTO FRAME, peering into the store to see if it's worth staying.
LEE: All he wanted was some mu-shu.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN: Are you okay, Lee? I'm sorry, I have to go.
LEE: I'm sorry, I have to go.
CARTER: I'm gonna solve this case myself. Taxi! Carter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat.
CARTER: ( loud ) Follow that limo. The Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter.
CAB DRIVER: Now you speak my language.

LEE: Did you tell Sterling?
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN: Let him find out on his own. I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
LEE: Thank you. Lee hangs up. A look of intensity. He CRANKS the RAP MUSIC up, a man on a mission.
CARTER: Stay here. I'll be right back. You Yes. I understand. Carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off, leaving him alone on the docks. Carter looks around the dock a pull up valet station parking fancy cars, RICH PEOPLE getting on the boat as their names are checked off a list by two DOORMEN.

LEE: Ricky Tan hears the steel in Lee's voice, acknowledges it.
RICKY TAN: . if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now. I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did. My enemies are trying to frame me.

Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the EXT. YACHT - STERN - CONTINUOUS Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat. Carter turns his head, sees STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should during a gangland shooting. Wordlessly, Reign disappears back into the shadows.
CARTER: What "revenge" is he talking about?
CARTER: Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are Stay out of it, Carter. You're going back to L.A.
CARTER: Fine with me. Sterling walks away disgusted.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN: I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to fully cooperate with the Secret Service. Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment. Chin motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to Escort Detective Carter to the airport
LEE: I'll take him.
CARTER: Hell no. The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS. Beat.
LEE: Don't push me, Carter. I'm in no mood for your bullshit. Carter gets in Lee's face. The two men look like they're about to come to blows.

CARTER: Forget it. A long beat while Lee considers what to say.
LEE: Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
CARTER: Ask me if I give a shit. Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.
LEE: Ricky Tan killed my father. Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee.
CARTER: How the hell did Tan get away with it?
LEE: All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved. Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
CARTER: ( pause ) This is about your Daddy's death? Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me. ( realizing ) This is about more than all that, isn't it? This is about your Daddy's last case, right? Lee's caught, fibs badly.
LEE: No, no, that would be crazy
CARTER: You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing.
LEE: I thought you'd think it was crazy.
CARTER: IT IS CRAZY! I know. I know. I am sorry. Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his car. Carter watches him. Finally he rolls his eyes and So are you getting on the plane or not?!

LEE: I cannot go to LA. Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the cop beneath the attitude.
CARTER: It sounds impossible
LEE: You said
CARTER: but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it. Carter turns, walks away without looking back.
LEE: Why LA?
CARTER: ( still not turning ) I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
LEE: I should go back. Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor.
CARTER: Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
LEE: Follow the Rich White Man?
CARTER: Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
LEE: Follow the RichWhiteMan.
CARTER: Not bad. Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one. Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
LEE: Big hotel billionaire. He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
CARTER: Big hotel billionaire. He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
LEE: How do you know he's our man?
CARTER: Because when the shooting started he was way too cool. See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
LEE: You sound like that all the time.
CARTER: Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
LEE: Maybe. But not like Asians. We never Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming? You people were screaming your asses off.
CARTER: Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming? You people were screaming your asses off.
LEE: Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
CARTER: The same place you find all Gefilte Fish. Lox and bagel. I love this stuff. Here, try it with a smear.
CARTER: Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out. They still just He just left. Kissed her on the cheek.
LEE: He just left. Kissed her on the cheek.
CARTER: He'll be back soon.
LEE: How do you know?
CARTER: Look at her. Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over. Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to sleep on the bed.
LEE: Carter, there's something I have to tell you. You were right about what you said in Hong Kong. All I do is work. Never take a day off. It's all I have right Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
CARTER: Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
LEE: The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
CARTER: You pull a muscle or something?
LEE: My fiancee left me over the summer a month before our wedding.
CARTER: I'm sorry, Lee. Why did she leave you?
LEE: It's a long story.
CARTER: Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing never knowing if you were dead or alive. I've seen it a million No. It was my singing.
LEE: No. It was my singing.
CARTER: Excuse me?
LEE: She hated my voice. Said it drove her crazy. I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it. She finally told me it was driving her crazy. Carter stares at Lee for a long BEAT.
CARTER: Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss our personal lives. Let's die curious. LEE LIFTS THE BINOCULARS - turns back to the building.
LEE: She's just standing around not doing Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
CARTER: Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
LEE: I'll try to stay awake. It's so boring. Isabella starts to remove her blouse. Lee starting to sweat as he watches her undress.
CARTER: What did you say?
LEE: Nothing. I said nothing. Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window.
CARTER: Hot? I'm freezing my ass off.
LEE: I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice. You want some ice?
CARTER: What's going on? Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed.
LEE: She's getting undressed.
CARTER: Gimme the binoculars.
LEE: No. It's not right.
CARTER: Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as Carter watches to the window.
LEE: What's she doing?
CARTER: Oh, sweet glory hallelujah.
LEE: I don't want to hear this.
CARTER: Skirt just came off. She's in black bra and panties Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh. it looks like Snoopy.
LEE: Snoopy? I love Snoopy.
CARTER: She just took her hair down. Now she's going for the bra the clasp is in front she's using both hands. You better get that ice. Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view.
LEE: That's enough. We shouldn't be doing Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the living room to pick up the PHONE. We see her clearly now in bra and panties.
CARTER: This is our job. We took an oath as police officers. If we don't do this, who will? Firemen? Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window. He sees Isabella hang up the phone.
LEE: She's reaching into her panties something is strapped to her leg. Oh, God.please don't let it be a dick.
CARTER: She's reaching into her panties something is strapped to her leg. Oh, God.please don't let it be a dick.
LEE: What is it?
CARTER: No, I don't believe this shit it's a microphone. Lee, she's wired.
LEE: I don't understand?
CARTER: She's walking back towards the door.
NO!: Carter and Lee stare at Isabella, who stands in bra and Lee lowers his eyes as Isabella looks at him, grabbing the BOMB, Carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom.
CARTER: Damn girl, you fine. Lee lowers his eyes as Isabella looks at him, grabbing the BOMB, Carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom.
LEE: GET DOWN!! Lee and Carter run back to the bomb.
GET DOWN!!: Lee and Carter run back to the bomb.
CARTER: Pick it up!
LEE: It's your turn!
CARTER: I don't need a turn! Carter picks it up, starts running with it through the hall, heading for the elevator.
LEE: Throw it! Carter is about to throw it in, when HE SEES AN OLDER COUPLE
HOTEL GUESTS: Do you want us to hold the elevator?
CARTER: Get the hell away from here! Carter is still holding the bomb, doesn't know what to do with it
LEE: Carter throws him the bomb, and Lee runs to the stairs
CARTER: Get out of the building! Lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package, has no choice but to throw it back to Carter.
LEE: EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible. He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS.
LEE: Wait! There's people down there!
CARTER: There's people up here!
LEE: Get it out of here!
CARTER: Take it! Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof Lee and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ISABELLA. She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.
ISABELLA: Get on your feet. Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella begins to open the package.
CARTER: I wouldn't do that!!!
LEE: It's a bomb. Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED
ISABELLA: You see, no bomb. Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for Throw us in jail? I'm about to bust you right now.
CARTER: Throw us in jail? I'm about to bust you right now.
ISABELLA: I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
CARTER: How do we know you're not lying? Let me see your badge. Isabella opens her bathrobe WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to her bra.
LEE: We can help you. I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
ISABELLA: I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
LEE: Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
CARTER: Yeah, that's right.
ISABELLA: We need to get out of sight. Come down to my suite.
ISABELLA: ( she locks the door ) Look, I've been working this case for months now.
CARTER: So what's your story?
ISABELLA: They think I'm a crooked customs agent. Lee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's package. Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the food from the mini fridge.
LEE: Is this a payoff?
ISABELLA: No. It's a sample. You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
CARTER: It's a myth. Some kind of counterfeit.
ISABELLA: It's much more than a counterfeit. 14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference. The paper is Crane linen blend and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
CARTER: How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
ISABELLA: In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran. We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press. The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
LEE: Five years ago?! That's right before he left the force. Lee and Carter exchange looks.
ISABELLA: It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year. Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates and started making superbills.
LEE: ( understanding ) And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
ISABELLA: Yes. They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake. Isabella lights a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL on fire, and it burns
CARTER: What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny The real question is, where are the plates? If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation. Isabella thinks for a beat.
ISABELLA: The real question is, where are the plates? If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation. Isabella thinks for a beat.
ISABELLA: Lee and Carter are officially out of the Secret Service's way.
CARTER: Secret Service Agent Carter. This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
LEE: We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
CARTER: They don't know that. What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview? I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings. You saw the way she was staring at me.
LEE: She never even looked at you.
CARTER: You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me. I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
LEE: I am not third world ugly. Women like me, they think I'm cute. Like Snoopy.
CARTER: Snoopy is about six inches taller than you. I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette. Lee reluctantly gets in, too.
CARTER: Kenny! How you doin'? Kenny looks up at Carter. A cool, appraising glance.
CARTER: ( to Kenny ) This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud voice, they all scream and run and shit. Watch. It's real funny. Kenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside.
KENNY: Come with me.
KENNY: Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
CARTER: What?? Where'd you hear that?
KENNY: I got my sources.
CARTER: And I got mine, meaning you. Nice how that works out. I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
KENNY: James, you see my kids back there? You know how much I'm paying for private school? How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't Jail!? James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
CARTER: Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't Jail!? James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
KENNY: Jail!? James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
CARTER: I'd like to see you try. Kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial arts move. Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him countering Kenny's move.
KENNY: ( to Lee ) We're on, then. Kenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence Lee BLOCKS Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance.
LEE: ( impressed ) That's a good Twisting Tiger where did you learn that? They switch to Chinese.
KENNY: Master Ching taught me.
LEE: The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
KENNY: No. Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw. Lee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny.
LEE: Baby Duck?
KENNY: That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid cause he was always quacking. Never shut up.
CARTER: I heard that. Lee and Kenny laugh.
KENNY: Is this about the funny money?
CARTER: How'd you know?
KENNY: You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning. How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn. Shit don't happen I don't know about.
CARTER: So tell me what you know.
KENNY: I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck but you knew that too, didn't you?
CARTER: Yeah. We already been there. This is big, Kenny. Benjamins. Secret Service calls 'em superbills. Banks can't even tell the difference. Kenny considers this for a moment.
KENNY: One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week. I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing. Including the vig brand new sequential hundred dollar bills. I knew something was wrong. Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared. The whole thing. And they checked out.
LEE: Do you still have the bills?
KENNY: I still have my lunch money from third Lemme see 'em. Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE. He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill. Carter checks it out.
CARTER: Lemme see 'em. Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE. He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill. Carter checks it out.
KENNY: See. It's perfect. Carter takes out a LIGHTER and holds the flame to it.
CARTER: All right, Kenny. Thanks. You're off the hook. For now. Carter and Lee move for the door.
KENNY: You sure you guys don't want to stay and have a bite? My wife's got the best mu shu this side of Compton. Carter and Lee exchange a look as we CUT TO:
CARTER: ( to a worker ) We're looking for a guy named Zing. Is he here? Zing hears Carter, turns and sees them. Then RUNS. Carter and Lee exchange looks and run after him.
HU LI: Who has her gun out. Waiting for them. ISABELLA is standing near by, and ZING is visible off to the side. An 18-WHEELER in the loading bay is just being shut and locked. A LIMO is parked beside it. Lee and Carter both assume fighting positions. When most of the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out, putting their guns close on Lee and Carter. They can't blink without getting mowed down.
HU LI: ( in Chinese ) The great Chief Inspector Lee I will be remembered for ridding the Triads of your petulance. Hu Li savors the moment.
CARTER: I hope you just said I have no business being here, 'cos I was just leaving. Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him, freezing him in his tracks. Isabella slowly walks several feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.
ISABELLA: Hu Li, I think there's someone who will want to talk to them first. Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement. BANG! Lee falls. Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt of her gun. BANG! Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across the jaw with her fist.
CARTER: .oh, that's a filling right there. That's gonna cost you. Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards.
HU LI: Put them in the truck. The WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck.
CARTER: I should kill you right now, but I'm gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine, and maybe you can be reformed. The WORKERS start towards Carter. He holds up his hands.
LEE: Are you okay?
CARTER: What's the first thing I told you never trust nobody. How could you fall for that shit? I knew she was dirty.
LEE: She saved our lives.
CARTER: For how long? Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides. Lee looks disappointed.
LEE: Shhh, my head hurts.
CARTER: I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me! This wasn't my case, Lee. Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central. I didn't have to help you.
LEE: Why did you help me?
CARTER: It doesn't matter. Lee thinks about this for a BEAT.
LEE: I'm not used to having a partner.
CARTER: We are not partners. Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
LEE: Well we're not friends.
CARTER: You got that right. And we ain't brothers. Maybe we should just end this right here.
LEE: Fine with me.
CARTER: I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me. We'll die in peace.
LEE: See you in the next world.
CARTER: I don't believe in reincarnation. So I won't see you in the next world.
LEE: I believe in heaven. You people believe in heaven?
CARTER: I believe in heaven. You people believe in heaven?
LEE: Yes. We have heaven.
CARTER: Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
LEE: What's a Chinese heaven?
CARTER: I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues. They don't let everybody in.
LEE: I think we should stop talking.
CARTER: Fine by me.
LEE: If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
CARTER: If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
LEE: Mind your own business.
CARTER: How was the sex?
LEE: There was no sex. She was very traditional. We were waiting until we were married.
CARTER: You're kidding. No sex? Nothing? No No mu-shu.
LEE: No mu-shu.
CARTER: What about a little king pao chicken?
LEE: No kung pao chicken. Never.
CARTER: Steamed dumplings?
LEE: Once in a while, steamed dumplings. But only when she was drunk.
CARTER: That's rough, man. If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go Tell me the truth, Carter. Do you think I have a good voice?
LEE: Tell me the truth, Carter. Do you think I have a good voice?
CARTER: Are you serious?
LEE: Forget it. It doesn't matter. Lee turns away from Carter.
CARTER: As long as you're asking.I think you have a pretty good voice.
LEE: I knew it. What does she know. You want me to sing something?
CARTER: That depends. How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
LEE: They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the Go ahead. Sing your ass off. Lee clears his voice.
CARTER: Go ahead. Sing your ass off. Lee clears his voice.
LEE: Did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world.and if you did, was she crying, crying.hey!
HU LI: Don't worry, the plates are safe. Yes, the dragon's been fed. She HANGS UP and glances at Isabella, who is doing her best to appear completely uninterested.
CARTER: Very nice.
LEE: It's focus. Every opponent has a weak spot. You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box. Carter opens the crate it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about $1,000,000 worth. He tosses a stack to Lee.
CARTER: I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box. Carter opens the crate it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about $1,000,000 worth. He tosses a stack to Lee.
LEE: Who's Benjamin?
CARTER: Benjamin Franklin, he discovered A Chinese man discovered electricity.
LEE: A Chinese man discovered electricity.
CARTER: No Chinese man discovered electricity.
LEE: Yes he did. He also invented the Now that I believe. Carter pockets two stacks of superbills. Lee looks at him.
CARTER: Now that I believe. Carter pockets two stacks of superbills. Lee looks at him.
LEE: We're slowing down. This must be it.
CARTER: End of the line.
LEE: You've been a good friend, James Carter.
CARTER: Oh no you don't. Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee. I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
LEE: You could never kick my ass. You mama's Don't you talk about my mama. That's more like it.
CARTER: Don't you talk about my mama. That's more like it.
ON LEE: still holding on to the door frame swings and backflips onto the roof of the truck.
ON CARTER: who swings onto the ground grabbing one of the guards to use a shield as gunfire erupts. Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the ground. He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield and together THEY SWING him into the truck KNOCKING DOWN the first two guards. Carter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT bolting them CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like the closest way out: A LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel.
LEE: This way. I see some lights. Lee and Carter spot a tiny sliver of light coming through a MANHOLE COVER. They start climbing up the metal stairs that lead up to the street.
CLOSE ON: Lee and Carter coming up from the manhole standing together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the LAS VEGAS STRIP. They cover their eyes, blinded by the greatest light show in the world.
LEE: Lee. I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash. They both turn around and come FACE TO FACE WITH: A TEN-STORY DRAGON. Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60
CARTER: Lee. I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash. They both turn around and come FACE TO FACE WITH: A TEN-STORY DRAGON. Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60
LEE: Red Dragon.
CARTER: That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat. Lee and Carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the hotel it's like a HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE. The richest of the rich are making their way inside.
LEE: Let's go.
CARTER: Wait a second. We can't go in like this. Look at this place, we gotta look fly. We gotta Mac out.
LEE: What is Mac out?
CARTER: Follow me my Asian brother. Carter and Lee start to walk away.
SALESMAN: May I help you gentlemen? Carter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of Black. 42-long. Nothing touches this body but pure silk. And get my partner something from the children's Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.
CARTER: Black. 42-long. Nothing touches this body but pure silk. And get my partner something from the children's Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.
SALESMAN: Would your partner like silk as well? I personally like it when a couple Carter takes his hand off Lee's shoulder.
CARTER: Couple? No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here. Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
LEE: Yes. We have lots of big men chasing I'm sure all the boys are chasing you two. Don't worry, I'll make you guys the bell of the ball. He WINKS as he walks off, and Carter looks at Lee.
SALESMAN: I'm sure all the boys are chasing you two. Don't worry, I'll make you guys the bell of the ball. He WINKS as he walks off, and Carter looks at Lee.
CARTER: This is the last time I go shopping with EXT. RED DRAGON - NIGHT Lee and Carter enter frame, dressed to kill - perfectly tailored couture Versace suits, gold watches, the whole bit. Le is awkward in "player" guise.
CARTER: ( whispering ) Remember, Lee, you're a player now. You own the place. Carter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as they walk through the doors.
LEE: I own the place.

The MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty. People crowded around the perimeter - a sign reads:

STEVEN REIGN: Vegas has been my town for 30 years. I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?

LEE: ( beat ) But I'll help you. Lee holds her for a long BEAT, their lips almost touching. He finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd. Carter walks up, sees Lee standing alone on the dance floor.

Now gimme a hundred-thousand in chips. And a Diet Coke and some wash-n-dries. Let's move, people, I came to play. The DEALER pushes 100K worth of CHIPS in front of Carter.
CARTER: I saw the sign, I can read. Now gimme a hundred-thousand in chips. And a Diet Coke and some wash-n-dries. Let's move, people, I came to play. The DEALER pushes 100K worth of CHIPS in front of Carter.
CRAPS DEALER: Those are five hundred dollar chips.
CARTER: Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
CRAPS DEALER: No, I just assumed.
CARTER: You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right? Are you a racist?
CRAPS DEALER: No, sir.
CARTER: ( starting to scream ) Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it? Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you? The PIT BOSS gets on his walkie-talkie.
PIT BOSS: Floor security, we have a problem at table nine.
CARTER: Answer me one question. How come Ben Vereen isn't performing here at the hotel? Is Ben Vereen not good enough for you people?
PIT BOSS: Lionel Ritchie is performing here Lionel Ritchie hasn't been black since the Commodores.
CARTER: Lionel Ritchie hasn't been black since the Commodores.
PIT BOSS: Sir, you're going to have to calm down. Carter watches as Lee moves past the guard and makes his way into the soft count room.
CARTER: I have a dream, where black people and white people can gamble together without getting different chips! A BIG CROWD has gathered as the Security Guards try and push their way through. The pit boss picks up the phone, calls Sing with me! "We shall overcome!" Carter starts clapping, and the confused crowd joins in as the Security Guards move in.
LEE: Hi. How's it going? You guys have change for a twenty? The GUARDS make their move. And Lee starts to fight them down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward the casino door but he gets slammed to the ground by a right cross. Hu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS. She holds a knife to Lee's throat.
HU LI: ( in Chinese ) Open your mouth. She puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut. She holds the detonator in her hand.
CRAPS DEALER: Winner six!
CARTER: How much is that?
CRAPS DEALER: Two-hundred thousand!
CARTER: Two-hundred thousand dollars? Who wants a hundred dollars? Carter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort.
GAMBLER: ( South African accent ) I am not royalty, sir.
CARTER: Don't say that, we're all royalty. My great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit we probably cousins, man. How much you got on the table?
GAMBLER: One million.
CARTER: Yeah, we definitely cousins now. Who wants to blow on my hand for luck? Carter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress.
TEXAN: ( embarrassed ) She's not my lady. She's my niece.
CARTER: Can I come over for Thanksgiving? Come on, baby, give me some luck. The GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her.
TEXAN: Hey, buddy, watch yourself.
CARTER: Don't threaten me. I got friends in this town that will bite off your ears. Just sit tight, because I've got the dice and I am on fire! Carter throws the dice.
CRAPS DEALER: Winner, seven! The table erupts as Carter grabs the dice.
CARTER: Let it ride!
RICKY TAN: Imagine a business where people hand you money. And you hand them back absolutely nothing. Ricky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee. Isabella is standing next to him. Lee is shocked at the sight of Ricky Tan alive.
HU LI: ( in Chinese ) He's going for the plates. Ricky Tan looks at one of the MONITORS, sees Steven Reign walking down a hallway, about to walk into the PENTHOUSE
RICKY TAN: Look at this old fool, what does he think he's doing? Ricky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee.
CRAPS DEALER: Winner! Four, winner!
CARTER: I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari. Do they sell those here in the gift shop? Somebody cash me Several TRIAD SOLDIERS dressed like SECURITY GUARDS approach Carter's table.
PIT BOSS: Sir, we'd like to escort you to the That would be great. Don't want any of these rich white people to jump me. As they walk toward the door marked "VIP ROOM", Carter glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.
CARTER: That would be great. Don't want any of these rich white people to jump me. As they walk toward the door marked "VIP ROOM", Carter glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.
RICKY TAN: Chai Hu Li. Have fun. Ricky Tan walks out. Hu Li holds the detonator up to Lee, plays with the button.
HU LI: ( in Chinese ) In a few minutes.you'll beg me to push this button. Hu Li pulls her KNIFE, moves towards Lee. She holds the blade to his face. About to cut him. When Isabella pulls her gun. Isabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind his back. Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her knife in the other. She takes a step toward Isabella.
ISABELLA: It's time to end this, Inspector. Isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator from Hu Li's hand slamming her against the wall and sticking the gun under her chin.
HU LI: Get the detonator! The Triads go for the detonator as Lee gets to his feet, KICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her. One of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee gets to him first. He fights with one hand tied behind his Hu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM. Lee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW.
CRASH!: An AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW. In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor. The NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including:
CARTER: The guards restrain him.
CARTER: Black man gets on a hot streak and you're all trippin'? Carter and Lee see each other. They have the same simultaneous though:
LEE: ( help! )
MMMMMM!!!!: Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE. The quickest way is the HIGH WAY. Lee leaps from TABLE to TABLE. Scattering playing cards. Reaching the carpeted divide.Lee doesn't stop. He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other Carter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in the Sky Room. He grins.
CARTER: Check it out. Catfight! POW! He socks a GUARD in the face.
CARTER: What the HELL are you doing with tape on your face? No time to explain two more security guards arrive. Kicks and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH! He bobs and weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in between swings. Suddenly: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room. Everyone HITS THE DECK. Carter and Lee dive on to the floor as panic ripples through the Casino. People FLEE for the
LEE: ( diving on Carter ) Hu Li HITS the TRIGGER just as it lands on a roulette table.
KABOOM!: The table is BLOWN OFF IT'S FOUNDATION. Chips and cash volcano. Hu Li is blown backwards by the force of the blast. SHEER PANDEMONIUM grips the casino.
CARTER: Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
LEE: I did!
CARTER: No you didn't!
LEE: Yes I did. I said MMMMMM! A hand on Carter's arm. THIS IS SERIOUS.
CARTER: We have to get to the Penthouse. Lee jumps up, SPRINTS toward the elevators at the dragon end of the casino.
LEE: We have to get to the Penthouse. Lee jumps up, SPRINTS toward the elevators at the dragon end of the casino.
CARTER: Hold on! Carter stuffs his pockets with chips, then races after Lee. But halfway up the carpet. Carter stops. Lee turns to see what is holding him up. Hu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her.
LEE: Just GO! Lee turns and runs off past the dragon. Unfortunately, FIVE TRIADS block his path. In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes short work of them, and races toward the elevators.
CARTER: Just GO! Lee turns and runs off past the dragon. Unfortunately, FIVE TRIADS block his path. In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes short work of them, and races toward the elevators.
LEE: Are you okay?
ISABELLA: I'm fine. She steps in, too weak and starts to fall. Lee grabs her and holds her in his arms. HE gently helps her down.
LEE: I didn't know which side you were on.
ISABELLA: Now you know. DING! The elevator doors open. Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY - the key to the SUITE. Lee takes the key, backs away and steps into the elevator.
RICKY TAN: American's love to gamble. Don't they, Mr. Reign?
STEVEN REIGN: I'm cutting our deal short. I'm And my plates?
RICKY TAN: And my plates?
STEVEN REIGN: They stay with me. I'm sure you won't have a problem with that. Reign shows Tan the gun in his belt. Grabs the bag and starts to walk toward the door.
RICKY TAN: I enjoyed that little story you told about the Dragon and the treasure. My mother used to tell it to me all the time. Do you know the moral of that story, Mr. Reign?
STEVEN REIGN: Greed will imprison us all. Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.
RICKY TAN: I hate that fortune cookie shit. Lee BURSTS through the suite door - watches as Reign falls dead to the floor. Ricky takes the black bag off the desk.
LEE: Put the plates down. Ricky Tan looks down at the gun in Reign's belt.
CARTER: Will you STOP?!?! What am I supposed to fight you with? No more toying. Hu Li CHARGES Carter, who GRABS a ROULETTE WHEEL as a MAKESHIFT SHIELD. She SLICES it in HALF! He's got nowhere to hide. She JABS him with the sword. Carter SCREAMS. Falls back against the table, clutching his chest. Hu Li WINDMILLS, kicking a Terra Cotta soldier on top of Carter, but
THWACK!: The DOUBLE-BLADED BAMBOO POLE in its hand ricochets back and she is PIERCED THROUGH THE SHOULDER with the blade. Staring at Carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees. Carter walks toward her, considers his options, then KICKS HER IN THE HEAD, knocking her out.
RICKY TAN: You're just like your father, Lee. All these years hiding behind his badge. I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change. When you think about it, I didn't really kill him. I just put him out of his misery.
LEE: Put the plates down. It's over.
RICKY TAN: I don't think it's over. There are casinos all over this country. Let me make you a rich man, Lee. Don't make the same mistake he did. Ricky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.
LEE: If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
RICKY TAN: Don't you remember? I'm already dead. Ricky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast, taking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as Carter bursts in the room.
CARTER: Hey, Ricky, how's it going man? What's up, Lee? Lee has the gun pressed to Tan's head. We've never seen him like this before.
RICKY TAN: Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
CARTER: Lee, you okay? Lee doesn't respond. He keeps an eye on Ricky.
RICKY TAN: He never begged for his life. Or tried to make a deal. All that he asked me, just seconds before I pulled the trigger, was that I promise not to kill Lee's finger is on the trigger he wants to pull the trigger but can't.
CARTER: Lee, wait a second. It's not worth it, man. He's making you do this.
LEE: It's worth it to me.
RICKY TAN: Do you have it in you, Lee? Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
CARTER: C'mon, Lee. He's going to jail. You won, now just put the gun down. Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.
RICKY TAN: That's what I thought. Tan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee the plates hit him across the face and knock him down.
WINNER!": INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT Lee and Carter are looking down at the street, both relieved it's finally over. Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.
CARTER: I don't know about you, but I need a wine cooler. As they turn to the door Hu Li is walking toward them, bleeding and half-dead. She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. This one twice the size of the one from earlier.
HU LI: ( in Chinese ) We'll go together, Inspector.
CARTER: Please tell me she just asked for a ride to the airport. Hu Li hits the switch - starts to smile. Lee and Carter turn and RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.
PENTHOUSE BLOWS!: The FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side of the hotel.
LEE: I can't believe I flew ten-thousand miles for this shit!! They lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES. The sign dips and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE
CARTER: We made it, man.
LEE: No problem. Lee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR OF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at them. The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a night on the town.
VERSACE SALESMAN: Well, there is a God after all. Lee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of the hotel.
LIMO DRIVER: Here we are. The Red Dragon hotel. In front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE CARS and Isabella and Sterling arresting TWENTY TRIADS.
VERSACE SALESMAN: We're all going gambling and then to see Siegried and Roy. I hope you two are feeling lucky!
CARTER: I saw that. She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though. Walking away, never looking back.
LEE: She's going home to New York. I need some ice. Lee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane.
CARTER: That your gate down there?
LEE: I'm this way. I guess this is goodbye.
CARTER: I'm this way. I guess this is goodbye.
LEE: I guess so. Thank you, Carter.
CARTER: You take care of yourself, Lee. Carter steps back, BOWS TO LEE. Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND like a brother. The two men smile. Turn to walk away.
LEE: Carter, wait. There's something I want you to have. Lee pulls a BADGE from his pocket. Hands it to Carter.
CARTER: Your father's badge? No way, man. I can't take this.
LEE: It's okay. I can finally let it go. Carter takes the badge. Smiles.
CARTER: In that case, I got something for you. I picked it up at the hotel. Carter pulls out a WAD OF CASH.
LEE: What is this?
CARTER: About fifty grand. I won it at the No, Carter. I can't take this.
LEE: No, Carter. I can't take this.
CARTER: It's okay, I got lots more. Carter pulls out another wad of cash.
LEE: This money is evidence.
CARTER: Come on, Lee. Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up. There must be something you want. Lee looks back toward Isabella.
LEE: I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden. See the Knicks play.
CARTER: New York City?
LEE: First class.
CARTER: The Plaza Hotel?
LEE: A little Mu-shu.
CARTER: Some Kung-Pao? They look at each other, smile.
LEE: Amen to that, brother. As Lee and Carter start to walk away together, the MUSIC SWELLS. "WAR" starts to PLAY. They dance their way through a crowd of people, their arms raised as the two friends make their way through the airport.
