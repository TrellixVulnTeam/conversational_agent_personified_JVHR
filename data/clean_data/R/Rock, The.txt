BENNIE: You'll get used to him. Every Sunday morning - rain, snow, holidays nothin, keeps him Away.
HUMMEL: Hi Barb. The house sold yesterday. I know, I know, the market's depressed. Anyway, I'm leaving the area. Some things I have to do. Things I couldn't do while you were here. Maybe you would have approved. Hell, I know you wouldn't have. ( beat ) I've tried everything and I can't seem to get their attention. But now they'll learn how it feels on the other side. Let's hope it elevates their thinking. Hummel puts new flowers on the grave. Walks off.
HUMMEL: Held better be. This is a security inspection.
COLONEL CALLAHAN: General Hummel! This is a surprise!
HUMMEL: That's the idea, Colonel.
HUMMEL: ( to Callahan ) Ten men who could have been terrorists are out there doing whatever they damn well please to your compound, Colonel. Here you sit with your ass chained to a fucking radiator. This is not a tight ship. I would not want to be in your shoes in the morning. Sgt. Crisp hits the FRONT GATE'S OPEN BUZZER and follows Hummel out of the room.
ISHERWOOD: ( V.O. ) Son of a bitch.
GOODSPEED: ( V.O. ) You owe me five dollars, Marvin. ACROSS THE ROOM - BILL GOODSPEED, 30, and partner/trainee MARVIN ISHERWOOD, 25, feet up on desks, with toy guns. This is Man's Boredom. A ceiling fan circles. Isherwood yawns; scratches neck with his gun GOODSPEED reloads. Aims. Fires. THE DART hits A CARDBOARD TARGET across the room which activates a Rube Goldberg series of events ending in a PLASTIC GIRL being ignited in a
ISHERWOOD: ( yawns ) I was told this was exciting work.
GOODSPEED: Patience, Marvin. It has its moments. A KLAXON sounds. Isherwood smiles excitedly.
DR. LONNER: C'mere, Billy. A dog at J.F.K. got a whiff of something postmarked to a Bosnian refugee camp. Could be detergent, could be seran gas. INSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - is a LARGE WOODEN CRATE next to a TABLE OF
ISHERWOOD: Bosnian refugee camp? I don't get it.
GOODSPEED: Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin. Serbians don't like Bosnians. Read a newspaper. It's good for you. Hold out your hand. Isherwood does so. It's shaky.
ISHERWOOD: I'm okay. Really. Let's do it- Hold on Goodspeed's uncertain look, and CUT TO: INT. GAS C ER - DAY - MINUTES LATER The door HISSES open. Goodspeed and Isherwood, in vulcanized rubber suits and visored helmets, enter. They go to the INSTRUMENT TABLE before the crate. A GLASS VESSEL with tiny air holes ( like a salt shaker ) descends from the ceiling. Inside are COCKROACHES. .
GOODSPEED: Coal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys.
DR. LING: ( into mike ) We have airlock, Bill. Proceed.
GOODSPEED: ( into helmet mike ) July 1, 0.900 hours, agent william Goodspeed and agent/trainee Marvin Isherwood. Initiating exam of a wooden crate. Suspicion of seran gas device inside. Goodspeed grabs a pry-bar from the instrument table-and slowly pries open the cratels wooden lid. He motions to Isherwood. Together they gingerly lift the lid. INSIDE THE CRATE - it's filled with "UNICEF" type stuff. Goodspeed lifts out a HOT-PLATE. Isherwood lifts out an EGG BEATER. Gocidspeed runs a POISON SENSOR past each.
GOODSPEED: Appears to be kitchen items, cleaning agents, and. ( lifts out a sweatshirt ) . old clothes.
ISHERWOOD: This is thrilling. Isherwood lifts out a DOLL. Goodspeed's POISON SENSOR'S NEEDLE goes crazy. !
GOODSPEED: Careful, goddamn it Marvin! The doll's eyes open. Its mouth blast a PINKISH SPRAY, hitting Goodspeed's forearm and Isherwood's palm. OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - DR. LING stabs a button marked "exhaust" and another marked "emergency." A KLAXON sounds. F.B.I. TECHNICIANS race for the exit. IN THE GAS CHAMBER - The pinkish gas hovers in the air. CEILING EXHAUST FANS begin to suck it up. IN THE GLASS VESSEL - The cockroaches convulse, flip in the air and explode, guts splattering the vessel walls.
ISHERWOOD: What's hap. what's happening..? DR. LING looks at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the control panel.
DR. LING: Don't panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas will clear. You're Goodspeed grabs the doll from Isherwood, slams it on the table, and grabs A SCALPEL. Cuts open the doll's chest.
GOODSPEED: I've got some bad news and some really bad news. The bad news is the gas is corrosive. It's eating our suits. ISHERWOOD looks at his RUBBER GLOVES. The rubber is beginning to bubble and corrode.
DR. LING: What's the really bad news. GOODSPEED peels back the doll's plastic chest, revealing: a C-4 EXPLOSIVE DEVICE and TEN POISON AMPULES.
GOODSPEED: Enough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas to kill everybody in the building. Isherwood's and Goodspeed's rubber gloves are melting.
ISHERWOOD: The acid's eating. it's eating my fucking suit.
GOODSPEED: Chill, Marvin.
DR. LONNER: Something's blocking the pipes, Bill. When in Christ's name are they gonna give us a new building .
DR. LING: Get the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine, Marvin. Isherwood, terrified, jerks open an OVERHEAD CABINET, revealing several 6 inch needled SYRINGES.
DR. LING: You die, we all die, Bill. Inject yourself, then diffuse it. Goddamn it, Bill, take the antidote. Isherwood fumbles with a huge syringe.
GOODSPEED: Get that away from me. I hate needles.
DR. LING: INJECT YOURSELF! LONNER, WHERE'S THE GODDAMNED WATER? The pipes are KNOCKING, now they're COUGHING.
INJECT YOURSELF!: LONNER, WHERE'S THE GODDAMNED WATER? The pipes are KNOCKING, now they're COUGHING.
GOODSPEED: LONNER, WHERE'S THE GODDAMNED WATER? The pipes are KNOCKING, now they're COUGHING.
DR. LONNER: It's coming, it's coming . ISHERWOOD sinks to his knees, holding the huge syringe in front of his heart, hari-kari style, hands trembling . GOODSPEED concentrates on the device; his calm is unsettling. His hands flash, grabbing instruments and performing precise, deft, functions. He snips a wire and splices it. Another. Another.
ISHERWOOD: Oh fuck oh shit oh fuck THIS IS LIKE FUCKING PULP FICTION ONLY
DR. LING: Five seconds, Bill, four seconds, Jesus Christ . GOODSPEEDIS RUBBER GLOVE is stretched to transparency. we see GOODSPEED'S FLESH through the acid-eaten rubber. He makes one final cut-and-clamp. THE DETONATOR on the poison gas turns off.
DR. LING: Three, two. the gas is clear! OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - GREEN LIGRTS FLASR on the control panel and A TORRENTIAL SPRAY soaks GOODSPEED AND ISRERWOOD. Isherwood is wide-eyed and trembling. Goodspeed glares at him.
DR. LING: Next time use the atropine!
GOODSPEED: I don't like needles.
CARLA: Every little dream I dream about you, Every little song I sing about you, It drives me crazy when you go away, ( notices Goodspeed ) Wanna keep you locked up at home . Goodspeed walks past her into the kitchen. Carla turns down the music. Goodspeed re-enters with a Budweiser.
CARLA: ( New Jersey accent ) Hey there.
GOODSPEED: Hey honey.
CARLA: Wrote a new song. Wanna hear it? Goodspeed sits heavily on the couch. Rubs his temples.
GOODSPEED: Not now.
CARLA: Boy, somebody's in a bad mood.
GOODSPEED: Yeah, somebody's in a bad mood. Carla changes the c.d.: A PUCCINI OPERA plays.
CARLA: Much better. She sits with him. Puts her arm around him.
GOODSPEED: Much better. She sits with him. Puts her arm around him.
CARLA: What happened baby. Tell me.
GOODSPEED: Had a close one.
CARLA: You want to talk about it?
GOODSPEED: Not really.
CARLA: You know how I feel about what you do.
GOODSPEED: Could we change the subject?
CARLA: That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
GOODSPEED: Hey! Now there's some good news.
CARLA: You think I'm too. ethnic for country music?
GOODSPEED: Carla Pestalozzi? No. Definitely not. You could have posed for the Mona Lisa. Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you. I hope that's a compliment. I could change my name. How 'bout Bobby Sue Pestalozzi? Billy io Pestalozzi?
GOODSPEED: Stick with Carla.
CARLA: Okay. How 'bout Carla Goodspeed? Six years, Bill. We've lived together six years.
GOODSPEED: We've talked about this, Carla, we've talked it up, down, inside and out .
CARLA: Billy, this probably isn't the best time . Bill, I'm uhhh.
CARLA: I'm pregnant.
GOODSPEED: You're what . ? She holds Up a positive home pregnancy test and CUT TO:
FEMALE TOURIST: Is it really true no one escaped?
HUMMEL: Not today. You go ahead.
HUMMEL: I think so. Startled, Park Ranger Joe backs into a cell. Baxter grabs the cell door open/shut lever and yanks it. The cell doors CLANG shut. Hummel, Baxter and the others walk off.
TOURISTS: Hey, what are you doing. ? wait a minute, what's going on. ?
CAPTAIN FRYE: General Hummel: Captains Frye and Darrow.
HUMMEL: Deploy as planned, Captain. Aye, aye, sir.
HUMMEL: Hello Ladies and Gentlemen. You are my prisoners. I have no intention of harming you. You will be fed regularly. That is all you need to know for now. Gamble and Starling begin passing out the field rations. 53 INT. WASHINGTON D.C. - J. EDGAR HOOVER BUILDING - NIGHT F.B.I. Director JAMES WOMACK exits his office in a tuxedo, trailed by MARGIE WOOD, a young F.B.I. Agent.
AGENT WOOD: ( re: Womack's tux ) In that?
AGENT WOOD: I really think you should take this call personally. They stare at each other and CUT TO: 54 INT. HOOVER BUILDING - DIRECTOR WOMACK'S OFFICE - NIGHT Womack, grabbing his phone. F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK F.B.I. Director Womack.
HUMMEL: ( V.O. ) First: I am holding eighty-one civilian hostages on Alcatraz Island. Make an excuse to their families and do not alert the media or there will not be eighty. Second: fifteen guided rockets armed with V.X. poison, are currently aimed at the population of San Francisco. I will call again at 0-hundred hours and state my demands.
HUMMEL: Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel. CLICK. Womack stares at the phone: calls to outer office:
HUMMEL: At ease, Gentlemen. It is traditional for me to meet with my officers before an operation. The heart performs one thing, the legs another, the brain another - all better function together or the body becomes ill, is prone to disease. ( beat ) Major Baxter, Gunny Crisp and I have been on the front lines since 'Nam.' Captain Hendrix was my adjutant in the Gulf. Get a haircut, Pete, you're lookin' like a You and your men are new to me.
CAPTAIN FRYE: Would the General like a recitation of our service records?
HUMMEL: I'm well aware of your service records, Captain, they are excellent. I want to be clear on why you - why all of us are here. You both stand to profit from this.
CAPTAIN FRYE: Profit is not my motive, sir. I am here to redress a Yes, sir, and to learn some people a lesson.
CAPTAIN DARROW: Yes, sir, and to learn some people a lesson.
HUMMEL: This country has places where wrongs are redressed, Captain Darrow: They are called courts of law. In the military, they are called Courts Martial. This country has places where lessons a-re leaned. They are called schools. Am I confusing you?
CAPTAIN DARROW: Well, sir, frankly . EL I see that I am '
HUMMEL: The only accurate term for what we are doing here is treason. Plain and simple. An insurrection against a government to which we have sworn allegiance. Everyone in this room must understand that. Hummel looks from face to face, studying each.
HUMMEL: The question is what kind of traitor are we. Coward or lion? Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson? I have posed that question to myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear. Have all of you?
HUMMELS' OFFICERS: Yes, sir.
HUMMEL: Within thirty-two.hours you will leave this country and not return. All of you can live with that?
OTHER OFFICERS: ( unison ) Yes, sir.
HUMMEL: Well, I cannot. So, regardless of what happens on this island in the hours ahead, I will stay. The men exchange surprised glances.
CAPTAIN HENDRIX: But General, you'll be prosecuted.
HUMMEL: Yes, Captain. And I plan on conducting my own defense. it will make the O.J. Simpson trial look like an episode of "Perry Mason." Take your posts, gentlemen. Semper fi.
GENERAL KRAMER: Last night Hummel and eleven marines, under the guise of a security exercise, walked off with fifteen V.X. rockets. It wasn't discovered until the shift change this morning. ON THE SCREEN - A YOUNGER HUMMEL in Vietnam.
GENERAL KRAMER: Here he is in Vietnam - I think a Major at the time. MORE SLIDES OF HUMMEL in various international theaters.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR: Four tours in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm. Three purple hearts. two silver stars and. the Congressional Medal of. Jesus. The man is a hero.
GENERAL KRAMER: A legend. During Tet he held off a brigade of V.C. single-handedly. Saved his whole company. Hence the nickname What was this book Hummel wrote on Vietnam? Anybody read it?
RAYDEN SINCLAIR: No. Give me the skinny.
GENERAL KRAMER: The "skinny," Mr. Sinclair, is that the U.S. should have either won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and stopped wasting American lives. I happen to share General Hummells view. The door opens. A NAVAL ATTACHE pokes his head in.
NAVAL ATTACHE: General, it's him. The call connects to a phone on the Frank, this is Albert Kramer.
GENERAL KRAMER: Frank, this is Albert Kramer.
HUMMEL: Hello Al. Howlre Judy and the kids?
GENERAL KRAMER: They're fine. I'm with General Peterson, F.B.I. Director Womack, Chief of Staff Sinclair, Security Advisor Lindstrom, and C.I.A. Director Amway. You've got a lot of people worried, Frank. Can you help us out? INTERCUT - PENTAGON and ALCATRAZ as necessary.
HUMMEL: I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands. Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China .
HAYDEN SINCLAIR: Southern China? We never admitted we sent troops into There is a pause.
HUMMEL: Who is that. Identify yourself. Everyone stares at sinclair.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR: White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, General.
HUMMEL: How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair.
RAYDEN SINCLAIR: I'm thirty-three.
HUMMEL: Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday I had led over two hundred incursions into China and personally killed that many of the enemy. General, put some duct tape over Mr. sinclair's fat, ignorant mouth. He has shit for brains and he is wasting my time. Sinclair's irritation is relieved by the Naval Attache, entering again, who hands him a phone and whispers:
NAVAL ATTACHE: The President calling from Moscow. Sinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone, speaking sotto voice.
GENERAL KRAMER: Continue Frank.
HUMMEL: Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and El Salvador. Remember the Gulf War. Those pretty "smart bomb" pictures on C.N.N.? My men lased those targets. Ten were left to rot outside Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu, gentlemen. No benefits were paid to their families; no medals conferred. These men died for their country and they weren't even given a coddamn military burial. This situation will not stand: you will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman "Red Sea Trading Company" account to an account I designate. From these funds, reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83 marines, families. The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's expenses. Am I clear?
HUMMEL: Identify yourself.
HUMMEL: You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.
GENERAL KRAMER: Frank, Jesus, this is classified information.
WOMACK: ( stunned ) Is this true? General Kramer, embarrassed, nods yes.
HUMMEL: If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney General and the boys down at Justice where it came from. Good luck. Hayden Sinclair returns to the table.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR: General, I've just spoken to the President and he is clear as hell on this: We will not negotiate with you and we do not care if .
HUMMEL: Someone please gag that man. Alert the media, I launch the gas. Refuse payment, I launch the gas. It is just after midnight. You have 36 hours - all of today and half of tomorrow, until 12 noon - to transfer the money. Don't even consider the standard counter measure, General.
GENERAL KRAMER: What's the potential casualty rate of a single rocket armed with V.X., General Peterson?
GENERAL PETERSON: In a dense urban area, sixty, seventy .
RAYDEN SINCLAIR: Well that's not so bad .
GENERAL PETERSON: Napalm. Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm. It burns it up consumes it upon detonation. The problem is that V.X. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm. Hummel must know about Willy Peter, General.
GENERAL KRAMER: 'Course he does. "Willy Peter," short for "White Phosphorous Incendiary Device," still in its test phase. It detonates at 6,000 degrees, enough to burn up V.X. That explains Hummells time frame. He knows we're not operational. What would it take, General?
GENERAL PETERSON: To equip a flight of F-16s with Willy Peter in 36 hours? An act of God. All right, we can try. But view the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative.
GENERAL KRAMER: Then on to our primary initiative. ( hits intercom button ) Send in S.E.A.L. Team Leader Anderson. ( to F.B.I. Womack ) Who's your best chemical biological man?
AGENT WOOD: ( rises ) I'll find out.
CARLA: Don't stop. do no stop.
GOODSPEED: Shit, shit, shit what time is it. I'll be downstairs in ten minutes. GOODSPEED hangs up. The couple stares at each other. Carla's seen this look before .
GOODSPEED: I've got to go to San Francisco.
CARLA: No. I'm sorry, but NO. I need you here with me. We need to talk about this.
GOODSPEED: I've got to go. She grabs his arm. I can't. I cannot deal with this right now . ( softly ) Bill, I am very Catholic. And very pregnant. And very unmarried. Help me with this. She turns away from him. He pulls her back.
GOODSPEED: I love you. I will marry you. I just didn't plan on this, that's all. Tell you what: come to San Francisco.
CARLA: ( smiles ) It's probably just a training exercise. Check into a hotel, order up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and .
GOODSPEED: It's probably just a training exercise. Check into a hotel, order up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and .
CARLA: . We'll finish what we started. Baby, are you sexy in those boots . GOODSPEED walks off in COWBOY BOOTS, robe and boxers,.. INT. PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT U.S.N. commander CHARLES ANDERSON, 35, just the hardest looking man you've ever seen, stands before the group. Anderson is a Navy S.E.A.L., an Incursion Team Leader. Before Anderson are AERIAL RECON PHOTOS of Alcatraz.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: A precision night drop is out due to the full moon. Likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the first shot, Hummel might launch. My second in command is working on an attack from within the The idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison, undetected, emerge in its center, and jump the marines from behind - take their rocket positions without a shot fired. But I need better You've studied the architectural plans.
GENERAL KRAMER: You've studied the architectural plans.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: They're useless. Alcatraz was originally a Civil War fort. It's been ripped up and rebuilt for years. Under there is a maze of shit, excuse my language. What I need is personal, firsthand intelligence on the island's tunnels. CAMERA FOCUSES ON F.B.I. Director Womack, who gives a very significant look to C.I.A. Director AMWAY.
GENERAL KRAMER: The former warden?
AGENT WOOD: Died in 1979. The guards we contacted are useless. There was a janitor, "Alcatraz Al". He worked there for twenty years, but he died in 1983.
GENERAL PETERSON: Didn't three guys escape? I thought I saw a movie about it.
AGENT WOOD: It's a Hollywood myth. No one's escaped Alcatraz and lived. F.B.I. Director trades a very significant look with C.I.A. Director AMWAY. Amway clears his throat. He is older, very old school. Everyone turns to him.
GOODSPEED: B.A. Columbia. M.A. and P.H.D., Johns Hopkins, biochemistry and toxicology.
GOODSPEED: This isn't a training exercise, is it sir.
AGENT SANCHEZ: Director, no one's ever escaped from Alcatraz .
AGENT SANCHEZ: You want him conscious or unconscious afterward?
GOODSPEED: Why's he going to help us now?
AGENT SANCHEZ: Steep price for some information. ( waves pardon away ) I don't need that to get what you want.
AGENT SANCHEZ: It's my middle name. Watch kid, maybe you'll learn something. Sanchez exits.
GOODSPEED: ( to himself ) Jesus look at this guy. INT. F.B.I. - INTERROGATION ROOM - MORNING Sanchez walks in, sipping coffee. Mason sits there, eyes forward.
SANCHEZ: I'm F.B.I. Special Agent in Charge Sanchez. Sanches sits. Mason stares at the table.
MASON: In charge of what? Fucking me over for another three decades?
SANCHEZ: ( congenial ) Hey. Easy. I just want to talk.
MASON: You know what F.B.I. stands for Sanchez? Fucking Bloody Idiots. I don't want to talk to you. A pause. Sanchez glares at Mason.
SANCHEZ: Just some questions about Alcatraz. It's a tourist attraction now. You remember Alcatraz, Mason. The word "Alcatraz" registers with Mason.
MASON: Do I remember Alcatraz.
SANCHEZ: Not the island itself. The tunnels underneath it.
SANCHEZ: There's no harm in cooperating with us.
MASON: Who's "us?" F.B.I.? C.I.A.? Why should I do that?
SANCHEZ: Maybe there's a gift in it for you.
MASON: ( to the mirror ) Timeo danaos et dona ferentes.
GOODSPEED: "I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."
MASON: Are you capable of reading, Sanchez? SANCHEZ is getting flustered.
SANCHEZ: I don't have time for this shit. Yes. I can read.
MASON: The story of Alchimadus. Know it?
SANCHEZ: THE OBSERVATION ROOM THE INTERROGATION ROOM
GOODSPEED: ( to himself ) Ancient Greece. Alchimadus was imprisoned by his THE INTERROGATION ROOM Thomas a Beckett. Heard of him?
MASON: Thomas a Beckett. Heard of him?
SANCHEZ: Maybe. Not really.
GOODSPEED: ( to himself ) Archbishop of Canterbury. Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second .
MASON: Solzhenitsyn. I've a sneaking suspicion you've heard of him.
GOODSPEED: ( to himself ) Russian poet and dissident exiled to Siberia.
SANCHEZ: Look, I'm asking the fucking questions here. You can trust the F.B.I.
MASON: That's a good one, Sanchez. What do you call and F.B.I. Agent who can't tell a lie? A mute. MASON turns away. As if SANCHEZ no longer exists. Suddenly, over a wall-mounted INTERCOM:
SANCHEZ: Here, call your lawyer and tell him you're going back to jail. SANCHEZ tosses a quarter on the desk and exits.
GOODSPEED: You mind if. uhm.. I take a shot?
SANCHEZ: He'll eat him alive.
GOODSPEED: Take his cuffs off. The Marshal uncuffs Mason's wrists. MASON rubs his wrists, staring now at Goodspeed.
MASON: Who the fuck are you, Mother Theresa? So much for Goodspeed's confidence.
GOODSPEED: No actually, I'm Bill Goodspeed. Mr. Mason, we really need your help. That's a pardon and release contract from the Attorney Generals office. It makes you a free man, provided you cooperate. He slides a ballpoint pen across to Mason. MASON looks at the pen, then What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
MASON: What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
GOODSPEED: ( lying ) I'm a field agent.
MASON: Tell me what you really do.
GOODSPEED: I'm a chemical biological weapons expert. MASON registers this information.. 73 IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Stupid, stupid, stupid ..
MASON: You said I'd be a free man. Define free
GOODSPEED: Uhm, well, emancipated. Unfettered.
MASON: I know what the fucking word means, idiot. In this context.
GOODSPEED: I don't understand..
MASON: During the time I cooperate, will I be outside? Outside a jail?
GOODSPEED: Well yes I suppose .
MASON: You suppose?
GOODSPEED: Yes. You'll be outside.
MASON: What's happening on Alcatraz, Goodspeed?
GOODSPEED: A hostage situation. A matter of life and death. MASON thinks. He picks up the pen.
MASON: ( looks at mirror ) Then on one condition: a minimum of two hours in the Fairmont Hotel - I trust it still exists. I want a shower and a new suit of clothes.
GOODSPEED: I think we can arrange that. With that MASON picks up the pen and signs the pardon contract. He hands it to Goodspeed, who exits. MASON turns toward the mirror, staring right through.
SANCHEZ: Why didn't you throw in a trip to Fiji?
GOODSPEED: Sir, that's a legal document.
WATCHES AS: IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM - MASON places THE QUARTER on the floor. He raises his metal chair; SLAMS it down on the quarter.
GOODSPEED: all had something in common.
GOODSPEED: They were imprisoned for doing nothing wrong. What's going on, sir? GOODSPEED watches MASON over Womack's shoulder.
MASON: one more thing: a shave and a haircut. Hello Womack. MASON and Womack stare at each other and CUT TO: EXT. MOJAVE - DESERT FLATS - MORNING A hot desert-vista. Miles of nowhere. A DODGE sits under a tripod. Suspended from the tripod, a
GENERAL PETERSON: I need four F-16's equipped with air-to-ground missiles .. twenty-six hours.
LT. FISK: Let me name some things that are more possible, General, with all due respect: winning the Lottery, climbing Mt. Everest barefoot, getting a parking space at Yankee Stadium, marrying Sharon Stone .
GENERAL PETERSON: You can. And you will. General Peterson walks off.
CARLA: ( V.O. ) ( recorded voice message ) Hi! Bill and Carla ain't in! State your business! Make it interesting!
GOODSPEED: ( into phone ) Listen Carla: I'll explain later, but don't come to San Francisco. CLOSE ON MASON, watching Goodspeed, picking up anything he can from the INT. GOODSPEED'S APARTMENT - DAY CARLA stands in the threshold of the apartment, watching the answering ( V.O. ) ( on the machine ) I repeat, don't come to San Francisco.
GOODSPEED: ( V.O. ) ( on the machine ) I repeat, don't come to San Francisco.
CARLA: Like hell I'm not. She exits, slamming the door.
MASON: ( sotto ) Who's Carla? And why don't you want her to come to San GOODSPEED doesn't answer. He notices the F.B.I. AGENTS staring at Mason and him. He straightens up.
GOODSPEED: You're on a need to know basis and you don't need to know.
MASON: You learn that line in Cub Scouts, Goodspeed? The van STOPS: the rear doors open to the FAIRMONT HOTEL SERVICE
MARSHAL CORD: Put 'em on. You've got forty-five minutes.
MASON: You going to stand there and watch?
MARSHAL CORD: That's right.
MASON: well if it excites-you .
MARSHAL CORD: Put the goddamn clothes on. IN THE SUITE'S LIVING ROOM Womack is dumping the contents of a BARBER'S BAG on the sideboard. Hands THE HOTEL BARBER, a swishy guy, a COMB, ELECTRIC TRIMMER and BIB. The BARBER frowns.
BARBER: I can't do a decent job with these.
BARBER: I'm an artist, not a barber.
MASON: Shall we do this outside? In the sunshine? The barber gulps. Follows MASON onto the balcony.
BARBER: How would you like it sir?
MASON: whatever's in style.
BARBER: oh fabulous. You look shabby. Shall I snip and cut the shabbiness away? The barber begins trimming Mason's hair. THE BALCONY - SOME MINUTES LATER Mason's hair and beard are neatly trimmed. The barber holds a mirror up; MASON examines himself.
MASON: Good. Thank-you. The barber stands. Clears his throat. Rubs his thumb and forefinger Yes of course. My secretary will take care of you.- See to the good man will you? Agent Star, glaring at Mason, leads the Barber out.
MASON: Yes of course. My secretary will take care of you.- See to the good man will you? Agent Star, glaring at Mason, leads the Barber out.
MASON: What say we bury the hatchet, Womack. MASON extends his hand. Womack looks at it. As Womack reluctantly takes Mason's hand, MASON slides the noose over Womack's wrist. He yanks it tight and shoulders director womack bodily over the balustrade.
MASON: In your head. Womack plunges, HOWLING, 9 stories to his death. No, he only falls 10 feet. SPROOOOOING he stops, hanging by his wrist off the side of the building, held there by
MASON: clothesline, staring at Goodspeed.
GOODSPEED: Jesus. JESUS CHRIST.. GOODSPEED fumbles for his gun. Finally unholsters it. DIRECTOR WOMACK, hanging below, is SCREAMING.
MASON: - Drop the gun or I'll drop your boss. EXT. FAIRMONT HOTEL - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY Two F.B.I. AGENTS, loitering by their vehicle, look up at WOMACK, dangling off the side of the building.
F.B.I. AGENT: Holy shit, we got a jumper. F.B.I. AGENT 2 raises binoculars to his eyes.
MASON: Whoops .. I'm feeling tired .. Whoops .. MASON lets Womack drop a foot. Womack SCREAMS! GOODSPEED drops his gun and grabs the clothesline. MASON bolts from the balcony into the suitels library. AGENT STAR sprints onto the balcony. Star and GOODSPEED begin hauling Womack up as . MASON steals through the suite, through the vestibule, and into the elevator. ON THE BALCONY - Agent Star and GOODSPEED hoist Directory Womack, red-faced and sputtering, over the railing. GOODSPEED grabs Star's walkie-talkie.
GOODSPEED: All units, this is Caretaker. WE'VE GOT A SIGNAL SIX. Mason's in the elevator! Let me know where he stops!
GOODSPEED: explodes out of the hotel driveway. GOODSPEED shouts to the F.B.I. AGENTS across the street:
GOODSPEED: That's him! The F.B.I. SEDANS ROAR off after Mason. GOODSPEED looks around. A Ferrari sitting there. GOODSPEED gets behind the wheel.

MASON: Jade Angelou stops cold. Slow-ly turns. And regards Mason. ACROSS THE ROTUNDA - GOODSPEED sees MASON and Jade. he stealthily moves toward them. BY THE COLUMN - MASON AND JADE Jade approaches MASON tentatively. He is stunned by her. By her beauty, her bearing, her likeness to'him.
MASON: Hello. Yes. It's me.
JADE: I uhm. I'm not quite sure what to say. This is all a bit much
MASON: Let's uhm. let's walk a ways. They walk off next to a TALL HEDGE. GOODSPEED follows on the other side of the hedge. INTERCUT between MASON and Jade, and Goodspeed eavesdropping. GOODSPEED pulls out his cellular phone, begins punching numbers.
JADE: So how long have you been out?
MASON: A while.
JADE: A while. And you didn't call? You are free now, right?
MASON: I'm here with you, aren't I?
JADE: Why now? I mean why today.
MASON: I was driving through San Francisco. I decided it was time.
JADE: Well there's not a lot I know about you other than you escaped from San Quentin, had a four day affair with my mother, and I'm the result. You can imagine I'm pretty confused.
MASON: I tried to explain in my letters.
JADE: Ahh. Your letters. They weren't very easy to follow. She fishes in her pocket. Pulls out A LETTER. WHOLE SECTIONS OF THE LETTER have been scissored out. Mason. frowns.
MASON: I see. Bloody prison censors.
JADE: How about explaining now? In the b.g. we HEAR POLICE SIRENS. MASON looks around.
MASON: Maybe this isn't the best time. Jade. Here sitdown. MASON and Jade sit on a bench. MORE SIRENS in the b.9. MASON looks off All will be explained. You must trust me on this. Someday very soon, after I get a few things settled, I will come back for you. What I need to know is: do you want me in your life?
MASON: All will be explained. You must trust me on this. Someday very soon, after I get a few things settled, I will come back for you. What I need to know is: do you want me in your life?
JADE: How can I answer that? I don't know if we can.. after 19 years, just start like that.
MASON: We are the same blood.
JADE: But I don't know you.
MASON: where to begin. My name is John Paul Mason. I'm Scottish. I attended Dartmouth Naval College. My favorite color is green. I like books. I like a good joke. At one time I shot a pretty fair round of golf. I'm in my 60's and I've been in jail half my life. Maybe it's better I go. She smiles. Puts her hands on his.
JADE: No. You're doing okay. Police sirens BLARE. And the entire park.is suddenly surrounded by
JADE: You lied to me. GOODSPEED approaches. MASON makes no attempt to move. Jade turns to F.B.I. miss. Your father is working with us. He's helping us resolve a.. .. dangerous situation.
GOODSPEED: ( flashes his I.D. ) F.B.I. miss. Your father is working with us. He's helping us resolve a.. ( looks at Mason ) .. dangerous situation.
JADE: He is?
GOODSPEED: Yes madam. We've got to go, John. MASON extends his hand to Jade. She takes it.
MASON: Jade - remember what I said. They hug. Then MASON walks off with GOODSPEED and Jade opens her hand, revealing the PIECE OF PAPER upon which Mason wrote his instructions. ACROSS THE PARK - F.B.I. AGENTS STAR and CORD run up.
GOODSPEED: ( sharply ) No cuffs until we get to the cars, They continue toward the waiting cars.
MASON: You surprise me, Goodspeed. Now I'm going to surprise myself: thank-you, you could have handled that differently.
GOODSPEED: ( tight ) You almost got me killed. Twice.
MASON: Hows your jaw? GOODSPEED wheels on MASON and swings. SNATCH. MASON catches Goodspeed's fist. Three inches from his face.
GOODSPEED: It hurts. SANCHEZ, DIRECTOR WOMACK and the F.B.I. AGENTS approach. Womack's arm is in a sling; he's in a volcanic rage.

MASON: No. Forty-two paces to the septic chamber. Fifty-seven to the That's not what you said three minutes It's not?
COMMANDER ANDERSON: ( pointedly ) That's not what you said three minutes ( innocently ) It's not?
MASON: ( innocently ) It's not?
COMMANDER ANDERSON: ( dagger stare at Mason ) Excuse me. Womack follows Anderson aside. They confer heatedly.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: I ask for someone with knowledge of the island's tunnels. you give me a fuckin, convict who wants to play "twenty He knows every inch of those tunnels, Commander.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: Then he's keeping it to himself. He's fucking with me and I don't have the time.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: Out of the question. He'll endanger the mission - he'll endanger my men. He's a security risk. Who says he won't bolt as soon as we turn our backs on him?
MASON: You son-of-fucking-Satan.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: The goal is to take out the launchers and neutralize the V.X.chem rounds, Goodspeed. Tell us what you know.
GOODSPEED: Well, the thermal imaging photos picked up the poison gas. Here. The prison morgue. It's probably being kept refrigerated. makes sense. V.X. gas begins to lose its toxicity at higher temperatures.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?
GOODSPEED: No sir, but I've studied them ..
GOODSPEED: A little, sir.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: So you've never been in a combat situation.
GOODSPEED: No sir. Should I begin the briefing on diffusing and detoxification sir?
COMMANDER ANDERSON: Won't be necessary.
GOODSPEED: Sir, these are very complicated devices.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: I know they are, Goodspeed. That's why you're going with us.
GOODSPEED: COMMANDER ANDERSON ( to S.E.A.L. Reigert ) Get him some gear. MASON stares at Goodspeed.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: ( to S.E.A.L. Reigert ) Get him some gear. MASON stares at Goodspeed.

S.E.A.L. DANDO: Nice to meet you too. SANCHEZ enters.
SANCHEZ: You look like shit.
GOODSPEED: Thank you.
SANCHEZ: You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
GOODSPEED: I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork. They say, "Bill, you're too fucking smart for field work." Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the commercial. Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at stake? Oh Jesus.
SANCHEZ: Chemical Weapons isn't a cakewalk, Goodspeed. GOODSPEED splashes cold water on his face.
GOODSPEED: I've got some bad news and some really bad news sir. Maybe the bad news isn't bad, maybe actually it's good ..
SANCHEZ: Spit it out.
GOODSPEED: My girlfriend's pregnant.
SANCHEZ: ( pause ) What's the really bad news.

CAPTAIN FRYE: Just a matter of time, buddy. The Pentagonlll cave and we'll be headin, south of the border a million dollars richer.

GENERAL KRAMER: We've spoken to the President. He's not too happy about Chief of Staff Hayden Sinclair enters.
HUMMEL: Well he'd better give me a goddamn assurance .
HAYDEN SINCLAIR: The only thing the President will give you is a fair trial after you're caught, General.
HUMMEL: That you, Sinclair? What exactly do you do at the White House? Answer the presidential phone? Wash the presidential limousine? Are you his golf caddy, Sinclair?
HAYDEN SINCLAIR: Now you give me some coddamn respect, General ..
HUMMEL: You want respect, you child, you coffee server? Let's talk about Dave Ridgeway.
GENERAL KRAMER: Who's Dave Ridgeway, Frank?
HUMMEL: A twenty-two year old marine tortured to death by a communist death squad in the El Salvadoran jungle. His mother and young wife were told by the Pentagon that he went A.W.O.L. Let's talk about the respect he got.
LOUIS LINDSTROM: This is going nowhere Frank ..
HUMMEL: Then let me tell you what is: The most lethal poison gas known to man into San Franciscols business district. You have twelve hours to deliver the money or be prepared to reap the whirlwind, gentlemen. CLICK. National Security Advisor Lindstrom stares at the phone. Shakes his head.
LOUIS LINDSTROM: What's the word from Mojave?
GENERAL KRAMER: General Petersen can give us no definite assurance on the Willy Peter capability. The men stare grimly at each other.
LOUIS LINDSTROM: Greenlight the S.E.A.L. incursion. General Kramer picks up the phone and CUT TO: EXT.

COMMANDER ANDERSON: Listen up, men. Mr. MASON here will run point for us. Lieutenant Shepherd will be attached to your hip, Mason. You breath, he breathes with you. Understand? LIEUTENANT SHEPHERD, young, laconic, nods at Mason.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: Shep, what's the status on the special operational gear for Mason.
S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD: ( hands over items ) one aluminum fork and one quart of motor oil in a squeeze tube.
GOODSPEED: Motor oil?
MASON: For cottonmouth. GOODSPEED and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: GOODSPEED here's our specialist. We will cover him while he neutralizes the' chemical threat. If he does his job we'll launch flares and hold our position 'till the cavalry comes. Make no mistake about it, gentlemen, we are going in against an entrenched force led by one hot-shit field commander. We are in the fight of our lives, I bullshit you not. Any questions? Let's move out. The move across the staging area to A CH-53 SEA STALLION and two HUEY COBRA ATTACK GUNSHIPS, their BLADES whipping with ferocity. S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD stands in the Sea Stallion's door. The S.E.A.L.s board past him. Last are MASON and Goodspeed.
MASON: After you, 'lace." GOODSPEED gives MASON a look and climbs in. Then Mason. Then Shepherd, who SLAMS the door shut. THE GROUND CREW waves red LIGHT SABRES: "all clear." The Hueys and the Sea Stallion lift off.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: Activate mini-cams. Anderson, Boyer and the other S.E.A.L.s flip on TINY VIDEOCAMERAS mounted on their shoulders. A NAVAL MEDIC passes out SYRINGES OF ATROPINE in ANKLE SHFATHES.
NAVAL MEDIC: Atropine. Any contact with the gas, use it. Each S.E.A.L. takes one; begins strapping it to ankle. GOODSPEED shakes his head, declining.
GOODSPEED: Uhn uhn. I hate needles.
SANCHEZ: Mini-cams operational.
CARLA: Would you please tell me what is going on?
AGENT CORD: Can't do that, malam. Sorry.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: You know what you're doing?
MASON: Yes. Little fancier than I'm used to. MASON examines the equipment. It's more modern, but not foreign to him. He adjusts his depth and oxygen gauges. Goodspeed, having a hard time, watches Mason.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: Prepare to deplore!
GOODSPEED: Wait a minute. What if this thing crashes . Dando looks at Reigert. They laugh. This remark they obviously find very funny. Dando continues buckling GOODSPEED Smile Goodspeed. Live a little. Life is short. especially And the S.D.U.ls are released, rolling out of the Sea Stallion on a set of tracks, SPLASHING DOWN into

CAPTAIN FRYE: ( V.O. ) Something on radar, sir. Two Hueys in standard formation, due east and approaching. Hummel raises binoculars. Scans the bay. HUMMEL'S POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS - THE HUEYS AND SEA STALLION, flying low, SCREAM toward the island. BACK TO SCENE - HUMMEL lowers the binoculars, clicks on his Royce, Scarpetti, Gamble, Starling: get to the west end of the island on the double. Think we have visitors.
BAXTER: Royce, Scarpetti, Gamble, Starling: get to the west end of the island on the double. Think we have visitors.
HUMMEL: Royce, Scarpetti, Gamble, Starling: get to the west end of the island on the double. Think we have visitors.

The S.D.U.s lights dim the FLUORESCENT GREEN. CLOSE-UP on BOYER, the three-man S.D.U.ls driver, intense, determined. CLOSE-UP on Boyer's fluorescent green INSTRUMENT PANEL charting their approach to the island. They've drawn close to the island. ' COMMANDER ANDERS6N swings an UNDERWATER SPOTLIGHT, which reveals A LARGE WATER INTAKE PIPE jutting out from the Island's bedrock, 7 ft. in diameter, covered by a GRATE thick with rust, barnacles and seaweed. There's a SMALL JAGGED HOLE, presumably through which MASON escaped 33 years earlier. EXT. UNDERWATER - POWER P . INTAKE PIPE - NIGHT The S.E.A.L.s cast off the S.D.U.s and direct their GREEN FLUORESCENT SPOTLIGHTS inside the hole in the grate. MASON stares at the hole.

ROYCE: Looks all clear, sir.
BAXTER: Tell 'em to stay out there.
HUMMEL: Tell 'em to stay out there.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: Thank-you very fucking much, Mr. Mason, you've led us to a room with no exit.
S.E.A.L. BOYER: Skipper, blow it or burn it?
COMMANDER ANDERSON: No time for the torch. Explosives'll bring the fucking world down on us. ( turns to Mason ) An idea, please, we're tight on time.
MASON: Wait for me to unlock the door.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: You do not look like Jesus Christ, Mr. Mason, so I'm having a hard time how you're going to accomplish that.
MASON: ( points ) Under there. UNDERNEATH THE STEAM ENGINE is a tiny crawl space. 10 STEAM RELEASE VALVES periodically emit BURSTS OF STEAM.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: You are shitting me. You catch one of those steam bursts and you're a corpse.
MASON: ( unshoulders his equipment ) I memorized their timing. MASON sits on the edge of the crawl space. F.B.I. looks inside the crawl space: WHITE HOT BURSTS of 500 degree Fahrenheit steam BLAST DOWN.
S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD: Uhh sir, you said never leave his side .
COMMANDER ANDERSON: You're not required to follow, Lieutenant Shepherd. This man is going to die.
MASON: ( grumbles to himself ) That's been said to me before .. MASON takes a deep breath and he rolls
S.E.A.L. REIGERT: Who the fuck is this guy? Houdini?
MASON: Welcome to the Rock. The Incursion Team files through the door and CUT TO: INT. TUNNELS UNDER ALCATRAZ - NIGHT Here, the tunnel moves up a steep incline to a LOCKED STEEL BULKHEAD. S.E.A.L.s REIGERT and DANDO check it out.
S.E.A.L. DANDO: She's at least three inches thick sir.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: Shit. Burn it. Dando unpacks an ACETYLENE TORCH. Reigert turns on the ACETYLENE VALVES ( tanks rigged to Dandols gear ) and sparks the torch. IT FLAMES UP, white hot. Dando starts toward the bulkhead. MASON steps past him, bending his KITCHEN FORK into an awkward shape. He fishes the fork in the lock; twists it, and.. POP. MASON throws open the thick bulkhead door. And climbs through the Guys are worthless.
MASON: ( muttering ) Guys are worthless.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: Who is this guy. ? INT. DRAINAGE PIPES LTNDER MAIN CELL HOUSE - NIGHT The team arrives at a series of concrete drainage pipes. MASON points up to one of them.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: The shower room? After you. MASON and the S.E.A.L.s climb into the drainage pipe. INT. DRAINAGE PIPE UNDER SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT The S.E.A.L. team, Mason leading the way, climbs toward a FAINT LIGHT emanating from a DRAINAGE GRATE above. S.E.A.L. REIGERT readies a FIBRE OPTIC SEEING DEVICE; he pushes the fibre-optic camera up through the grate.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: Motion sensor. Anderson gingerly lifts the grate. Reigert wiggles his hands past the edges of the grate and nudges the beam transmitter ( with one hand ) and the beam receiver ( with the other ) away from the grate.
ROYCE: Sir. Anti-disturbance temblar tripped in the shower. We got INT. MAIN CELL HOUSE - SHOWER ROOM The grate pops open. S.E.A.IL.s BOYER and REIGERT, wearing NIOHT VISION GLASSES, emerge taking defensive positions back-to-back. Commander Anderson follows. Then, one by one, the rest of the S.E.A.L.s emerge.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: ( to Lt. Shepherd in the drainage pipe ) Stand fast. We'll secure the area. ANDERSON directs Boyer and Reigert to a TILED COLUMN. They creep across the tiled floor, taking "check and defefid" positions behind the shower's TILED COLUMNS. But suddenly, shockingly...FLOODLIGHTS flash on. Coming from the mezzanine above. The S.E.A.L.s whip off their night vision goggles.
SANCHEZ: What's that.what the hell is that? INT. ALCATRAZ - DRAINAGE PIPE UNDER SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT Goodspeed, Mason, and Lt. Shepherd react to the sudden illumination above.
GOODSPEED: ( whispers: ) What's going on?
S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD: ( whispers ) Don't know.
HUMMEL: ( V.O. ) Drop your weapons. The S.E.A.L.s, terrified, hesitate but do not drop their weapons They stand back-to-back, weapons trained at the catwalk. squinting into the white light. The S.E.A.L.s behind the tiled columns take cover. we cannot yet see Hummel and the marines. This plays with as much tension as possible. The situation is chilling:
COMMANDER ANDERSON: ( V.O. ) Commander Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives of your men, you will order them to safety their weapons and place them on the deck at their feet-
HUMMEL: ( V.O. ) Commander Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives of your men, you will order them to safety their weapons and place them on the deck at their feet-
SANCHEZ: Oh Christ this isn't happening.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: Sir, we know why you're out here. God knows I agree with you sir, but like you sir, I swore to defend this country against all enemies. Foreign, sir, and domestic. ( shouts now ) General, we've spilled the same blood in the same mud. You know goddamn well that I cannot give that order. BEHIND A COLUMN - S.E.A.L.s REIGERT and BOYER stare into the Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander. I'm not going to ask again.
HUMMEL: Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander. I'm not going to ask again.
HUMMEL: Don't do anything stupid, Commander. No one has to die here.
COMMANDER ANDERSON: You men following the General: You are United States Marines and under oath you forgotten that? We all have shipmates we remember - some of 'em were shit on and spit on by the Pentagon - that doesn't give you the right to mutiny.
HUMMEL: That's a nice speech, Commander. I heard plenty like it in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. They all added up to zero. Pretty words aren't gonna get you out of this, Commander. Now abort this mission. Goddamn it, abort. BEHIND THE COLUMN - S.E.A.L. BOYER, just 20, having never seen combat, is trembling with fear, indecision.
S.E.A.L. BOYER: It's us or them, Reigert, fuck they're gonna waste us .
S.E.A.L. REIGERT: Get a grip on yourself .. ON THE MEZZANINE - PVT. COXIS BOOT nudges a TILE which has come loose from its mortar. The tile inches to the edge of the mezzanine. Then it falls .. BOYER, reacting to THE FALLING TILE, brings up his machine gun and fires A SUSTAINED BURST in its direction And all hell breaks loose. THE MARINES fire in unison. A cruel withering fusillade. - THE S.E.A.L.s in the middle of the floor take the brunt of it. They gamely return fire. But they're hit. Again. Again. Again. IN THE DRAINAGE HOLE - Goodspeed, Mason, and Lt. Shepherd listen ( and watch, when the view allows ) in utter horror to the firefight above. Lt. Shepherd scrambles up the ladder. GOODSPEED grabs him. Tries to pull him down.
GOODSPEED: Don' t do it.
S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD: Let go of me. Lt. Shepherd climbs the ladder. IN THE SHOWER ROOM - ANDERSON takes a bullet in his leg. His automatic blazing, he takes a bullet in the forearm. The chest. The shoulder. THREE MARINES on the mezzanine are hit and killed. LT. SHEPHERD climbs out of the drainage pipe and comes up firing. He instantly takes a bullet through the visor, killing him instantly. SHEPHERD falls to his knees and pitches over, falling face first into THE DRAINAGE HOLE, where SHEPHERD'S lifeless eyes come face-to-face with Goodspeed, who nearly passes out, then looks away in horror. S.E.A.L.S BEHIND THE COLUMNS return fire. They're hit, picked off.one by one. MARINE COX AND MCCOY fire a 50 CAL. GUN ( as powerful as anti-aircraft or anti-tank round ) through the column, killing REIGERT and BOYER.
HUMMEL: HOLD YOUR FIRE HOLD YOUR FIRE .. INT. DRAINAGE PIPE UNDER SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT Suddenly the-firing stops. GOODSPEED and MASON freeze. Thinking fast, MASON rips the TAC RADIO from Shepherd's helmet, takes his 9 MM PISTOL and MACHINE GUN, and his SAW-TOOTHED KNIFE AND SHEATH, and climbs down. Goodspeed, indecisive at first, clambers down after Mason. INT. PIER 39 - MOBILE COMMAND TRAILER - NIGHT ON THE VIDEO MONITOR - An image transmitted from Anderson's helmet camera. Anderson has fallen, so this is at ground level. We see corpses and near corpses.
SANCHEZ: It's over.
F.B.I. TECHNICIAN: We've still got movement. Numbers eleven and twelve. That's GOODSPEED and.. Mason.
GOODSPEED: We're never gettin off this island.
GOODSPEED: ( over tac radio ) .. god Jesus we're gonna die Sanchez, agitated, exits the Command Trailer with Director Womack. They huddle, speaking in hushed voices.
SANCHEZ: You told me I am on a "need to know" basis. Well goddamn it, I need to know. Who the fuck is John Mason. Start talking, Director, or I swear I will go to the press. A tense pause. Then Womack sighs, and his voice travels back three decades .
SANCHEZ: What about the daughter? why didn't Hoover use her as leverage?
SANCHEZ: My god, you're not saying . MASON slides the clip back in the machine gun. Tests the action. obviously comfortable with firearms .
GOODSPEED: Don't shoot me. MASON was actually slinging it over his shoulder.
MASON: For christ's sake. MASON trudges down the tu=el. Goodspeed follows him.
GOODSPEED: Wait. Where're you going?
MASON: Off this island. You mind?
GOODSPEED: Yes I mind. I mind very much.
SANCHEZ: ( O.S. ) ( over tac radio ) Goodspeed, Goodspeed, come in.
MASON: You've got a phone call. MASON throws the tac radio at Goodspeed's feet and trudges off. GOODSPEED grabs the tac radio.
GOODSPEED: It's me sir.
SANCHEZ: ( O.S. ) What is happening? Where's Mason?
GOODSPEED: He says he's leaving the island sir.
SANCHEZ: Don't let him do that.
GOODSPEED: He's got a gun, sir.
SANCHEZ: What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL? Get him back! GOODSPEED hurries off after Mason.
HUMMEL: I never wanted this. Jesus christ.
BAXTER: We knew it might happen, Frank.
CAPTAIN DARROW: Maybe now they'll pay up.
CAPTAIN HENDRIX: Maybe now they won't.
CAPTAIN DARROW: Then maybe we'll execute a few hostages. One S.E.A.L. DANDO, is still alive. He's gurgling blood. Staring up at You'll go to hell for this General.
S.E.A.L. DANDO: You'll go to hell for this General.
CAPTAIN DARROW: ( to Pvt. Royce ) Put a bullet in him. Pvt. Royce, appalled, can't bring himself to do it.
CAPTAIN FRYE: You heard him. End it. Cpt. Darrow pulls his sidearm and levels it.
HUMMEL: CAPTAIN, HOLSTER THAT SIDEARM. Yes sir. Royce kneels. Feels Dandols carotid artery.
CAPTAIN DARROW: ( lowers sidearm ) Yes sir. Royce kneels. Feels Dandols carotid artery.
ROYCE: He's dead anyway sir. Hummel leans down. Stares into Dando's video feed. INT. PIER 39 - NIGHT womack and SANCHEZ stare at HUMMEL on the monitor.
HUMMEL: ( V.O. ) ( over monitor ) You have a made a terrible mistake and more of our brothers have died in vain. Let's not repeat this. The transmission goes dead.
HUMMEL: Rodent problem, people. Let's flush the pipes. Pvts. Cox and McCoy go to the drainage pipe.
GOODSPEED: would you stop. Just stop. I don't know whatyou did or why you were sent to jail, but there are a million people across that bay who might die. Fuck this. Stop. Freeze. MASON turns. GOODSPEED has his g gun trained on him. He's not the most convincing gun handler.
CAPTAIN HENDRIX: ( whispers in tac mike ) Rodents located. Hendrix and Crisp begin preparing a SATCHEL EXPLOSIVE.
GOODSPEED: F.B.I. Stop right there. I really mean it.
MASON: ( stops ) If you really mean it, take the safety off. GOODSPEED fiddles with the safety catch. With a swipe, MASON snatches the gun. They glare at each other.
SANCHEZ: ( V.O. ) ( over tac radio ) Goodspeed. Goodspeed, come in. Have you resolved this?
GOODSPEED: Now he has all the guns, sir. . You've got to help me. What do you want me to do, beg?
MASON: Save your breath and your dignity, if you have any. I am leaving. I am getting my daughter and getting the hell out of here. MASON walks off. Suddenly stops. THE SATCHEL EXPLOSIVE has fallen at his feet. MASON turns, looks at Goodspeed. And they sprint back, the way they came. IN THE TUNNEL BEHIND THEM - A MONSTROUS EXPLOSION blows in the tunnel and knocks MASON and GOODSPEED to their feet.
MASON: Hold your breath. They dive into a pool of stagnant water, submersing as the WALL OF FLAME blows through the tunnel over their heads. Mason, then Goodspeed, drags himself out of the water.
MASON: Come on. And keep your mouth shut. MASON hurries off, GOODSPEED on his tail.
GOODSPEED: Now what? MASON moves to the bricked-up wall. Feels around the mortar. Smiles. Removes a brick. another. Another. A WHOLE CLUMP of bricks falls, revealing A HOLE.
MASON: Came out right through there. ( squeezes through the hole; mutters ) 'Course I've gained a few since . GOODSPEED follows MASON through the hole.
MASON: Across that, then 50 yards to the morgue. You said that's where the fucking poison is, Goodspeed.
GOODSPEED: I don't get it. You're going to help me?
MASON: No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons. What the fuck do you You don't have to get all bent out of shape.
GOODSPEED: You don't have to get all bent out of shape.
MASON: What's bent out of shape, idiot, is the tunnel I was going through to freedom five minutes ago.
GOODSPEED: All right, all right. Don't call me idiot, okay? MASON what did I do to deserve this? What God did I offend ... GOODSPEED begins to wade into the pool.
MASON: ( GOODSPEED stops ) There. And there. GOODSPEED squints. The water slithers with COTTONMOUTHS. MASON unpack the QUART OF MOTOR OIL in spray bottle.
MASON: Cottonmouth snakes. They breath through their skin. Oil clogs it. They hate the stuff.
MASON: sprays the motor oil across the pool. The snakes scatter. The pool's now coated with an OIL SLICK. MASON wades in. Goodspeed follows. The COTTONMOUTHS, repulsed by the oil, stay away. GOODSPEED tries not to look at the snakes. They make it across.
GOODSPEED: Something's a little off here: I'm the F.B.I. Agent, you're the convict, and you have all the guns. MASON slaps the .9 MM pistol into Goodspeed's hand walks off. GOODSPEED follows.
GOODSPEED: The morgue? MASON nods. Moves to a STEEL-RUNGED LADDER leading to a GARBAGE CHUTE against the wall. GOODSPEED INT. ROOM ADJACENT TO MORGUE - NIGHT MASON and GOODSPEED emerge from the garbage chute. They hear VOICES in the next room.
MASON: Never hesitate. Gamble fires from his position around the corner. MASON and Goodspeed dive for cover behind a cabinet. GOODSPEED fires from cover without looking, his gun raised over the cabinet. Mason, underneath the cabinet, fires at GAMBLE'S FOOT. Gamble, shot, hits the deck. GAMBLE unclips a GRENADE. Before he can pull the pin.. MASON FIRES HIS CLIP EMPTY at the AIR CONDITIONER MOUNT on the ceiling above Gamble. The mount gives; the ENORMOUS AIR CONDITIONER falls, crushing Gamble. Gamble's GRENADE, still secured with the pin, rolls GOODSPEED rises. Looks at Gamble under the air conditioner. Just HIS LEGS stick out. ( Note: the rest of the scene's action plays out around Gamble's legs.
GOODSPEED: You didn't learn that in prison.
MASON: No, and I used to be a lot quicker.
GOODSPEED: I've got some questions for you but they can wait. GOODSPEED opens the CORPSE DRAWERS revealing the V.X-. CHEM ROUNDS ( shaped like big tennis ball cans ). GOODSPEED carefully lifts out a chem round. MASON grabs one, accidentally knocking it against the drawer.
GOODSPEED: Careful. The second you don't respect this, it kills you. GOODSPEED and MASON set the V.X. chem rounds on the mortician's table. GOODSPEED pulls out his EQUIPMENT KIT. Begins detaching the tops of the chem rounds. GOODSPEED reaches inside a chem round and carefully pulls out... a STRAND OF V.X. POISON PEARLS: ping-pong ball sized glass bubbles filled with poison.
GOODSPEED: I need a hand here.
GOODSPEED: of wind chimes.
MASON: What. exactly does this do to you?
GOODSPEED: Any epidermal exposure or inhalation and you'll know: A twinge at the small of your back as the poison seizes the nervous system. Then loss of muscular function. Then you spit your guts out, it looks like a tub of spaghettils spilled on the floor, then your skin turns black. MASON stares uneasily at the pearl strands.
MASON: Sounds like my first marriage. GOODSPEED has the chem round's GUIDANCE SYSTEMS exposed. Inside are tiny GUIDANCE SYSTEM MICRO-CHIPS. GOODSPEED plucks the chip from each chem round and pockets it.
GOODSPEED: ( into tac radio ) Pier 39 come in.
SANCHEZ: ( V.O. ) ( tac radio ) Goodspeed? Where the hell have you been. Talk to me.
GOODSPEED: We're in the morgue. I'm removing the rocket's guidance system chips. Without em the rocketslll fly about 500 feet and splash down like a wounded duck.
GOODSPEED: a BEEP. GOODSPEED and MASON whirl. Pvt. Gamble's WALKIE TALKIE is talking to them:
HUMMEL: ( O.S. ) Gamble, Starling. Come in. MASON and GOODSPEED exchange a nervous look.
HUMMEL: ( O.S. ) Privates Gamble and Starling, come in.
HUMMEL: The morgue. Hummel and Baxter exit quickly.
MASON: C'mon c'mon.. faster .. GOODSPEED nearly drops a chem round. MASON I thought you were cool under pressure.
MASON: I thought you were cool under pressure.
GOODSPEED: Shut up; you're making me nervous.
MASON: They'll be on us in twenty seconds.
GOODSPEED: Wait a minute. Fuck. Hummel stole fifteen chem rounds. There's only twelve here. Here. Quickly. Do these last four. MASON raises the poison pearl strands from each of the remaining four chem rounds. GOODSPEED quickly plucks the chips from the guidance EXT. ALCATRAZ - MORGUE - NIGHT Hummel and the marines converge on the morgue. Surround the door. They burst inside, guns trained.
HUMMEL: Hendrix! Take Royce and Scarpetti! CAPTAIN HENDRIX and PVTS. ROYCE and SCARPETTI dive into the incinerator chute after MASON and Goodspeed.
BAXTER: Gamble and Starling are dead.
CAPTAIN HENDRIX: FOLLOW ON FOOT! INT. ALCATRAZ - MONO-RAIL TUNNEL - NIGHT The three carts fly down the mono-rail: GOODSPEED and MASON ( in CART 1 ) 50 feet ahead of Scarpetti ( in CART 2 ), who is 50 feet ahead of Hendrix ( in CART 3 ) IN CARTS 2 AND 3 - SCARPETTI and HENDRIX fire M-16s.
FIGHT SCENE: Mason's sprawled on the floor of the cart. Hendrix levels his M-16. MASON whipsaws the legs under Hendrix, bowling him over, the M-16 falling away from the cart. MASON and Hendrix get to their feet.. They trade blow after blow as the Cart ROARS through the tunnel.
MASON: BRAKE! ! ! IN CART 1 - GOODSPEED CART 3 SLAMS into CARTS 1 and 2 at 20 m.p.h., crushing Hendrixls head and torso between Carts 2 and 3. The collision knocks MASON off Cart 3, SLAMMING his head against the tunnel wall. MASON falls unconscious.to the tunnel floor, while CART 1 is shoved by the collision across.a DITCH OF WATER in the tunnel floor. GOODSPEED groggily gets to his feet. Jumps down from the cart.
GOODSPEED: In the midst of this PVT. ROYCE runs up. Sees MASON concussed, helpless. Royce draws his GLINTING KNIFE. Kneels over Mason. He's going to cut his throat.
GOODSPEED: Royce lowers the knife. Looks across the ditch at Goodspeed. The ditch is 20 ft. wide and filled with dank, stagnant water and we've seen dank, stagnant water before.
GOODSPEED: Pretty easy killing an unconscious man. How about trying me? What're you waiting for? Limp dick.
ROYCE: I am going to fuck you up something fierce. You rolled the wrong number, shithead. You crapped out. And ROYCE begins to wade into the ditch. And GOODSPEED is looking at the water, waiting. ROYCE is waist deep now. Royce feels something. He winces. Looks down at FIVE COTTONMOUTH SNAKES, fangs wide and white, plunging into him. Royce screams. His knees buckle. He falls to his knees in the water. A COTTONMOUTH stuck to his neck. Royce SHRIEKS again . And slides gently under the water.
GOODSPEED: I rolled snake-eyes. Shithead. Goodspeed, hand over hand on the monorail, eases the cart across the stagnant ditch. Hops out. MASON gets to his feet. The two exchange a look.
MASON: Limp dick?
GOODSPEED: They stumble off down the mono-rail tunnel.
MASON: I think I've got arthritis.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR: The President arrives in three hours. His directive is to string Hummel along until the airstrike is operational.
LOUIS LINDSTROM: What's the word from Mojave, General?
GENERAL KRAMER: ( grim ) They're going as fast as they can. A corrugated aluminum hangar. SUPER: Mojave Desert United States Air Force Testing Facility

HUMMEL: ( V.O. ) ( loudspeaker ) Attention Navy Seals, attention. MASON and GOODSPEED freeze.
GOODSPEED: He thinks we're Seals.
HUMMEL: ( V. 0. ) ( loudspeaker ) Congratulations. You've taken some things of mine. I can't convince you to return them so I'll put on someone who can. A pause. Then A MALE VOICE. Nervous. Quivering.
MALE VOICE: ( V.O. ) ( loudspeaker ) Hell. hello.
HUMMEL: Tell them your name and age.
LARRY HENDERSON: My n.name is L. larry Henderson. I'm forty-eight.
HUMMEL: Good Mr. Henderson, continue .
LARRY HENDERSON: I don't know who you are, but p please, there's a gun
HUMMEL: ( V.O. ) ( loudspeaker ) Convinced? Mr. Henderson hopes so. You have two minutes. GOODSPEED turns to Mason.
GOODSPEED: I'll go.
MASON: What, vou?
GOODSPEED: What, vou?
MASON: I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
GOODSPEED: Good point. Okay here, take 'em. GOODSPEED unpockets the V.X. ROCKET'S GUIDANCE CHIPS. Hands them to Mason. MASON heaves them into the bushes.
GOODSPEED: What are you doing?
MASON: Now they only have three rockets left.
GOODSPEED: What about Mr. Henderson?
MASON: Hummel's a soldier, not a murderer.
GOODSPEED: ( stops; turns ) Find the rockets. If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
MASON: ( stops; turns ) Find the rockets. If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
GOODSPEED: I. I don't know if I can do this.
MASON: There's only one way to find out. I'll try to give you time. And Don't be an idiot. Put that on. MASON moves off into the night.
GOODSPEED: Well thank-you, thank-you very much. GOODSPEED creeps toward the China Alley rocket launcher.
CAPTAIN DARROW: Gotta be kidding me. They send an old man. MASON gives Darrow a hard-eyed glance. Hummel takes a lap around Mason, sizing him up.
HUMMEL: I thought I'd been in the service a long time. Name and rank, John Paul Mason. Royal Navy. Commander.
MASON: John Paul Mason. Royal Navy. Commander.
HUMMEL: You're a long way from England, Commander Mason.
MASON: I feel strangely at home.
HUMMEL: How's that?
MASON: You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
HUMMEL: Do you have some unique knowledge of this prison facility, Commander Mason?
MASON: Quite unique.
HUMMEL: How's that?
MASON: I was a guest here. Glances all around. Someone laughs. Everyone laughs.
GOODSPEED: ( V.O. ) ( Cox freezes ) Drop the weapon and turn around. Slowly. Pvt. Cox drops his weapon. Slowly turns. Goodspeed, one hand on his gun, the other on HIS TOOLS, begins to unscrew the V.X. CHEM ROUND
HUMMEL: Well you're some kind of joker, Mason. Maybe you're a lunatic. Are you of sound mind, Mason?
MASON: I'm not threatening the lives of a million innocent people. You Hummells demeanor changes. Hard now. Tight.
HUMMEL: Give me the guidance chips.
MASON: I threw them in the bay.
HUMMEL: That was stupid of you.
MASON: ( re: hostage Henderson ) Would you have shot him7
HUMMEL: You seem like a bright man, Commander. Bright men understand Bright men also obey the law. "Wherever law ends, terror begins." John Locke.
MASON: Bright men also obey the law. "Wherever law ends, terror begins." John Locke.
HUMMEL: "Where there is no law, there is no transgression." The Bible. Romans, Chapter 4, Verse 15.
MASON: Article 7, American Constitution? "Treason against the United States shall consist of. 11
HUMMEL: The American Constitution was written by traitors, Commander. Traitors against a government founded on injustice and tyranny and ( beat ) I see little difference in my motivation.
HUMMEL: Do you, Commander Mason? Suddenly GUNSHOTS. Coming from China Alley. Hummel and men whirl around, startled.
HUMMEL: Frye, Crisp, go!
MCCOY: Swallow that and I swear on my Aunt Myrtle's grave I'll cut your belly open and pull it out. McCoy and Cox spring at Goodspeed. McCoy whips the butt end of his gun against Goodspeed's head. GOODSPEED crumples, unconscious. McCoy jams his fingers in Goodspeed's mouth. MCCOY He bit the fuckin' thing. It's shot.
GOODSPEED: ( no response ) ( V.O. ) It's about time.
MASON: ( V.O. ) It's about time.
GOODSPEED: Where are you?
MASON: Above you. WIDENING, we see that MASON'S MATTRESS has been ripped into long strips.
MASON: finely constructed. Mason's been at this several hours. INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO CELLS ( and during the following, MASON keeps busy with his rope braiding ).
GOODSPEED: This is tiny.
MASON: You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed? Or another portion of your anatomy ..
GOODSPEED: The cell, Mason.
MASON: Five feet by seven. Try living in one for a year. What happened?
GOODSPEED: I only got one chem round. There are two left. I fucked up.
MASON: ( sarcastic ) Surprise, surprise.
GOODSPEED: I'm not a field agent, all right? So cut me a break.
MASON: An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
GOODSPEED: What is your beef with the Bureau, anyway Clmon. Tell me.
MASON: Let's say our countries had a little dispute. They both knowingly shafted me.
GOODSPEED: Familiar with the name Hoover, Goodspeed? I don't mean a vacuum cleaner .
MASON: Familiar with the name Hoover, Goodspeed? I don't mean a vacuum cleaner .
GENERAL PETERSON: Captain Giler?
GOODSPEED: ( thinks ) Why didn't you just tell Hoover and the bureau where the microfilm was? Make a trade?
MASON: Some trade. They'd get the microfilm and I'd get a bullet in the I see your point. Something's been on my mind. About your MASON rises. Lifts the bed. Pulls off the bed's heavy ROLLING CASTER. Knots the caster onto one end of the braided rope.
GOODSPEED: I see your point. Something's been on my mind. About your MASON rises. Lifts the bed. Pulls off the bed's heavy ROLLING CASTER. Knots the caster onto one end of the braided rope.
MASON: MASON rises. Lifts the bed. Pulls off the bed's heavy ROLLING CASTER. Knots the caster onto one end of the braided rope.
GOODSPEED: You went down the shower drain, through the tunnels to the power plant, under the steam engine and out through the intake pipe - that much I've got ' But. howld you get out of your cell? MASON leans out his cell and tosses the rolling caster down the cell block. The braided rope, tied to it, plays out to it's full length.
GOODSPEED: ( cont'd ) I only ask because, in our current situation, it might be useful information . The result: the braided rope lies across the cell block floor, the rolling caster tied to it. MASON holds the other end of the rope through the bars of his cell.
MASON: Trade secret, Billy, I'll tell you this: it was easier than getting in.
MASON: jerks from the floor. The CASTER, pulling the rope, flies past Mason's shooting in an arc around the corner of the cell block, still pulling the rope, where the caster-pulled ROPE catches the CELL RELEASE LEVER against the wall. The rope coils, WRAP WRAP WHAP, around the release lever handle.
MASON: slowly and delicately. THE CELL DOOR RELEASE LEVER pulls down and -~ MASON'S CELL DOOR ( and all the doors on that tier ) open at once. And
MASON: INT. GOODSPEED'S CELL - MORNING Suddenly Goodspeed's cell door opens. GOODSPEED exits the cell. MASON stands there.
GOODSPEED: Hey! Hey what's happening? Mason. Mason? Suddenly Goodspeed's cell door opens. GOODSPEED exits the cell. MASON stands there.
MASON: You're on your own, kid. Your gear's over there. MASON motions to a HEAP OF THEIR GEAR ( clothes, weapons, flares ) in the corner of the cell tier.
GOODSPEED: Mason. 225 EXT. ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - MORNING Hummel sits behind the desk. Baxter, Frye, Darrow, Hendrix in front of him. Silence. Hummel stares at his phone. The tension is palpable.
GOODSPEED: Mason. 225 EXT. ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - MORNING Hummel sits behind the desk. Baxter, Frye, Darrow, Hendrix in front of him. Silence. Hummel stares at his phone. The tension is palpable.
HUMMEL: ( consults his watch ) Fifteen minutes Frank.
BAXTER: ( consults his watch ) Fifteen minutes Frank.
CAPTAIN FRYE: lower lighthouse, one on the rooftop, ready for fire. ( no response )
HUMMEL: I heard you Captain.
CAPTAIN DARROW: Prepare for launch General? General?
HUMMEL: Not yet.
CAPTAIN FRYE: General Hummel, noon is approaching.

LOUIS LINDSTROM: When was the last communication from our men on Seven hours ago. The Naval Attache enters excitedly. NAVAL ATTACHE General, the white phosphorous attack is operational. General Kramer grabs the phone.
GENERAL KRAMER: Seven hours ago. The Naval Attache enters excitedly. NAVAL ATTACHE General, the white phosphorous attack is operational. General Kramer grabs the phone.
GENERAL KRAMER: Get me the President.
GOODSPEED: Mason. John. What happened - the injustice done to you - doesn't mean you can walk away from this. A million people across that Bay will die.
MASON: Only one of them I care about.
GOODSPEED: You were once a different man.
MASON: You don't know what kind of man I was.
GOODSPEED: You were a civil servant. Sworn to do your duty. Just like MASON begins climbing down to the waterline.
CAPTAIN DARROW: Eleven fifty-seven, General. Three minutes to go.
HUMMEL: They're going to call.
CAPTAIN FRYE: They are not going to call General.
HUMMEL: I. I don't understand this.
CAPTAIN DARROW: I understand it. They're calling our bluff. We have two operational rockets left. We have to stick one of those rockets in their ear, General.
HUMMEL: I'.I don't know Frank.
BAXTER: I'.I don't know Frank.
HUMMEL: Seventy thousand peqple. I didn't. i didn't ever.
CAPTAIN FRYE: You didn't ever what? You didn't ever what, General? General, forty-eight hours ago I was in a cushy job at Pendleton. As of this moment I am subject to prosecution for treason and murder. Do you know what that means. It means the electric chair. For all of us.
BAXTER: He's right Frank. Authorize the launch or it's over. All eyes on Hummel now.
CAPTAIN DARROW: Authorize the launch, General. Hummel nods and
GOODSPEED: You'll never make it.
MASON: I once swam the English Channel, but you're entitled to Goodspeed, disgusted, turns and heads back, grumbling.
GOODSPEED: Fine. I'll fuckin, do it myself.
HUMMEL: ( V.O. ) ( over walkie-talkie ) Launch coordinates 675 dash 439.
CAPTAIN FRYE: Aye aye General: coordinates 675 dash Awaiting launch INT. INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - MORNING Hummel stares at a GRIDDED MAP OF THE BAY ARF.A.

CIWTER FISHERMAN: What the hell.. ? EXT. SKIES OVER SAN FRANCISCO BAY - DAY The V.X. rocket screams down. at 500 ft. altitude it DETONATES. Showering a cloud of V.X. POISON onto the bay.
CAPTAIN FRYE: I don't believe it. He pulled the plug. Frye, disgusted, races down the STAIRS.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR: They need a decision Mr. President. The President ( who we don't see ) gazes into the East Garden. The President hits his INTERCOM to the room where his cabinet is gathered. INTERCUT with the authorities, reactions, as needed:
PRESIDENT: These past few hours have been the longest, darkest of my life. This is when you wish the buck did not stop here. A balance between two tragedies. On one hand the fate of a million civilians. On the other, Frank Hummel. That we have ignored or abandoned or marginalized a great soldier like Frank Hummel and that American boys have paid the price of that neglect in blood, is equally real, and equally tragic.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR: The glass is half full not half empty, sir. No civilian casualties so far.
PRESIDENT: I don't believe in half full or half empty, Sinclair. There are chemical weapons and there are civilians. And there are men on Alcatraz wholve proved they're willing to use the one on the other. ( beat ) We are at war with terror. Fighting a war means casualties. This is the worst call I've ever had to make. ( takes the phone ) Air strike approved.
CAPTAIN FRYE: You're gutless. I knew it.
CAPTAIN DARROW: The problem is now thev know it.
HUMMEL: Careful son. I'd maintain discipline if I were you. Darrow draws his .45, levels it at Hummel. INTERCUT with MASON Goodspeed's reactions.
CAPTAIN DARROW: I'm relieving you of your command General. Captain Frye?
CAPTAIN FRYE: I'm in.
CAPTAIN DARROW: Major Baxter looks from Darrow to Hummel.
HUMMEL: It's over Frank. I'm in. Hummel blinks. He can't believe this.
BAXTER: It's over Frank. I'm in. Hummel blinks. He can't believe this.
HUMMEL: Tom, I warn you.
BAXTER: Stand down, General.
HUMMEL: I'm giving you a direct order.
BAXTER: ( draws his .45 ) I'm not accepting it.
MASON: HUMMEL , gunshot, reels toward the STEEL DOOR behind him. He wrenches it open and lunges outside into the corridor. IN THE CORRIDOR - MASON fires into the command center, sending Frye and Darrow diving for cover.
GOODSPEED: IN THE INFIRMARY WASHROOM - GOODSPEED collapses against the wall. His blood runs across the tiled floor. MASON takes a defensive position in the washrooms doorway. DARROW AND FRYE attack through the infirmary's maze of rooms, taking cover where they can, squeezing off rounds. MASON fires at Darrow and Frye from the doorway while GOODSPEED kneels over Hummel. Hummells dying and knows it. he stares at Goodspeed through glassy eyes.
HUMMEL: My god what have I done .
GOODSPEED: It's not too late, General. Tell me where the last chem round Lower lighthouse . Hummel dies. MASON and GOODSPEED turn from Hummel to each other.
HUMMEL: ( gasps for air ) Lower lighthouse . Hummel dies. MASON and GOODSPEED turn from Hummel to each other.
MASON: Do your job, Billy. - I'll try to hold ,em off.

MAIN CELL HOUSE - DAY EXT./INT. ALCATRAZ - LOWER LIGHTHOUSE - DAY gun raised. Crisp spins, drawing his .45.
GOODSPEED: Don't .
GOODSPEED: CORRIDOR - DAY MASON Suddenly the HEAVY STEEL DOOR creaks open and A SATCHEL EXPLOSIVE flings out, sliding across the corridor floor toward Mason. MASON turns and sprints away. Frye bolts from the room, s printing the other way.

CAPTAIN FRYE: new channel ) Cox, McCoy, get your asses up here!
CAPTAIN DARROW: Give that to me.
GOODSPEED: You shoot me, I'll drop this and we're both dead. One of these pearlslll kill everything within 200 feet. You know how this shit Darrow drops his gun. Pulls out a TITANIUM BLADED KNIFG.
CAPTAIN DARROW: You know how this shit works? Darrow advances on Goodspeed. The only route to GOODSPEED is between the rocket and the window. Darrow continues advancing., GOODSPEED eyes the launcher's IGNITION SWITCH. As Darrow passes between thewindow and the launcher ..
GOODSPEED: You know the Elton John son, "Rocket Man"?
CAPTAIN DARROW: I hate it. Darrow lunges. GOODSPEED stabs the IGNITION SWITCH. The VX ROCKET LIFTS OFF, HITTING Darrow square in the chest.
GOODSPEED: Well it happens to be my favorite fuckin, song!
GOODSPEED: POISON PEARL STRANDS, his hand shaking. With the other hand, he unclips the ROCKET GUIDANCE CHIP. The COPPER STRANDS holding the pearls are corroded. A strand BREAKS. Four PEARLS fall. GOODSPEED catches three. The FOURTH drops, hitting his SHOE. It rolls along the rooftop. GOODSPEED sets aside the other pearls and dives, grabbing the stray pearl an inch from the roof,s edge. Suddenly THE HUGE LIGHTHOUSE WINDOW behind GOODSPEED EXPLODES, showering GOODSPEED with glass. ON THE ADJACENT ROOFTOP ~ PVT. MCCOY, wielding a smoking .60 Cal MACHINE GUN. McCoy fires a wicked, long, sustained burst, emptyinc his entire ammunition belt. THE LIGHTHOUSE SEARCHLIGHT FRESNEL blows to shreds. GOODSPEED rolls away, GLASS SHARDS raining down on him, cutting him-. He's a sitting duck. MCCOY casts aside the .60 Cal and unshoulders a SNIPER RIFLE. Draws a bead on GOODSPEED again. GOODSPEED, bleeding, terrified, cowers, awaiting death. A SILHOUETTE APPEARES behind McCoy. It's MASON, dirty and bloodied. McCoy spins. MASON bats the rifle aside, KNEES McCoy in the solar plexus, grips McCoyls NECK SNAP! -and HURLS him off the roof. McCoy falls 5 floors. GOODSPEED gives MASON a thankful glance. And hears THE DOOR BURST OPEN
CAPTAIN FRYE: Give me the guidance chip. Frye raises his M-16 as GOODSPEED jumps. Lands hard on the ground below and sprints off.
MASON: INT. NEW INDUSTRIES BUILDING - DAY Frye creeps close to Goodspeed's hiding place. GOODSPEED lunges from behind the machinery, jamming his fingers into Fryels mouth and ramming home the POISON PEARL. GOODSPEED HAMMERS his fist into Fryels JAW. We hear the glass breaking in Fryels mouth. Fryels eyes widen. GREY SMOKE SPEWS FROM HIS MOUTH AND NOSTRILS. His eyes bulge. GOODSPEED tries to step away. Frye bearhugs him, pressing his face close. Frye open his mouth, spewing forth a CLOUD OF POISON in Goodspeed's face.
CAPTAIN FRYE: You're comin, with me. GOODSPEED shoves Frye away. Frye drops, his body quivering. Blood pours form his ears and nose. Frye spasms in a sickening dance of GOODSPEED reels away,. COUGHING. Dizzy, he falls to his knees. He's gassed and knows it. Desperately, he rips at his PANDLEG. A SYRINGE taped to his calf. ATROPINE. He pulls it free and hesitates. A beat, then He PLUNGES the long needle into his chest. Into his heart. Depresses the plunger.

SANCHEZ: Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it. GOODSPEED hangs up. The two men regard each other.
GOODSPEED: Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you. You know that pardon contract you signed?
MASON: Womack ripped it up, right?
GOODSPEED: You knew? All this time?
MASON: I'm not a fool, Billy.
GOODSPEED: All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go Goodspeed. You know the etymology of your name?
MASON: Goodspeed. You know the etymology of your name?
GOODSPEED: God's speed.
MASON: Yes. To wish someone a prosperous jouey. MASON smiles. GOODSPEED smiles back. There is an immediate tacit And if you turn around I'll tell you a secret. Goodspeed, confused by this, gives MASON a look. Slowly turns around. Camera doesn't leave him.
MASON: And if you turn around I'll tell you a secret. Goodspeed, confused by this, gives MASON a look. Slowly turns around. Camera doesn't leave him.
