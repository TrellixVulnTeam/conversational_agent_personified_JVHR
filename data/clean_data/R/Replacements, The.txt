SUMMERALL: That play, my friends, sums up the Redskins' running game all day long. Now Washington calls their last time out.
MADDEN: Hey, the Dolphins do this as good as anybody. See, in a four, three, two, two, you got the guards... boom!... Plugging up the middle, then the corners... boom and
MADDEN (V.O.): It's all about money, folks. More money, of course and ain't it always? The shame of it is the big losers are you out there, the fans.
SUMMERALL: Here we go: Third down, eight seconds to play, ball on the Dolphins' thirty-three yard line. Skins down by a touchdown.
MARTEL: Green 48! Green 48! Hut! Hut!
MADDEN (V.O.): There goes Martel!
SUMMERALL: Well... Martel goes down ten yards short of a score.
MADDEN: On maybe the last play of the season.
SUMMERALL: I think he might have slipped.
MADDEN: Yeah, there's a lot of that going around.

MADDEN: ... Pretty bold move by New England Patriot owner Victor Kiam, who went out and bought an entire semi-pro team once the strike happened.
MADDEN (CONT'D): Redskin management, on the other hand, is going with a bunch of unknowns. Their public relations people don't even have bios yet on most of their players, although we'll see one or two familiar faces out there today.
SUMMERALL: Like Shane Falco, the enormously talented college quarterback from Ohio State, who never fulfilled his potential in the pro's. (to Madden) Wow, remember that
MADDEN: Oh, yeah, they were absolutely decimated!
SUMMERALL: Dusted. And if I'm not mistaken, Falco set a record in that game for Bowl interceptions. Anyway, for some of these players this is another shot; a last shot, probably, for a guy like Falco...

LEE: What did you call me?!
ANDRE: You heard me, you tub a rice shit!

JAMAL: (to Lee) Don't be messing with my brother...
SHANE: Hey, hold on...
REF: Delay of game!    Five yards!
SUMMERALL: ... I don't know. Something seems to be going on in the huddle. It looks like... yes, Shane Falco is on his back. They haven't run a play yet but Falco is down.
MADDEN: This is not a good sign.
SHANE: (clearing the
SHANE: What?!
JAMAL: That's to the right... right?
ANDRE: No, it's to the left.
SHANE: It's to the right!
JAMAL: You better be quiet, Shane, they'll hear you.
REF: Delay of game!     Five yards! McGINTY What the hell is going on?
MADDEN: Well, Pat, so far the Redskins have minus ten yards offensively.
O'NEIL: Turn it off. This is going to kill me.
SHANE: Blue 68. Blue 68! Hut! Hut!
SHANE: Have you suddenly decided you don't like me, Jamal?
JAMAL: Oh. You said it was to the right, didn't you?
SHANE: Okay. Let's try something simple. 18 red left slot open. (to Jamal) That's to the left!
SHANE: Eighteen red! Eighteen red! Hut! Hut!
SHANE: Yeah!
EARL: Wide right! You got wide right! Check on the wing!
PATRIOT QB: Blue fourteen!
PATRIOT QB: Green eighty-seven!
SUMMERALL: I think the Redskins just set a record for penalties in the first three minutes. We're waiting for the stats on that...
SHANE: What?
LEE: I don't feel good.
ANDRE: Oh, God!
COCHRAN: Oooooh...
JAMAL: Man, that's ripe!
EVANS: Shane, we got to move!
SHANE: Okay. On the count of three. Everyone more left. Hut! Hut! Hut!
PATRIOT LB: What the fuck is this?
SUMMERALL: John, how many years have we been calling games together?
MADDEN: Seventeen, I think.

SHANE (O.S.): Hut!

SHANE: Red fifteen! Red fifteen! Hut!
MADDEN (V.O.): ... began with a Redskin end around, but Cochran, the pulling tackle ran into Falco's pitchout ... see?
MADDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D): Right here, it bounced off his helmet. Then it was kicked by Landon and then Hayes touched it, I think, and then Green got a hand on it, and then Bellinski recovered it and then he lost it, and finally the ball took a crazy bounce right back into
SHANE: Hut, hut!
SUMMERALL: Falco is intercepted. That's too bad.
MADDEN (V.O.): Yeah, and it looks like he's hurt, too. He was really starting to put it together here in the fourth quarter. Only forty-eight seconds now left on the clock.
BATEMAN: The ball. Okay, Coach.
PATRIOT QB: Hut, hut, hut!
SHANE: I can't...
SUMMERALL: Here comes Falco with eighteen seconds left on the clock.
MADDEN (V.O.): I'm surprised to see him again after that shot he took from Bellinski.
SHANE: 22 green!
SHANE: Check! Black 43! Black 43!
ANDRE: What's that mean?
REESE: (whispering back) He's changing the play. Listen!
SHANE: Black 43!
MADDEN (V.O.): It's a long count. Falco could be calling an audible.
LAMONT: (to Shane) Is this right?
SHANE: (shaking his head) Black 43 left!
SHANE: Hut!   Hut!
SUMMERALL: Lamont scores!
MADDEN (V.O.): Whoa! Falco calls an audible at the line of scrimmage and Lamont takes it in! McGINTY (V.O.) (in Shane's helmet) I guess you saw something I didn't.
SUMMERALL: With eight seconds remaining, Pacifico will try the extra point that will send this game into overtime.
MADDEN (V.O.): This turned out to be one hell of a contest, Pat!
MADDEN (V.O.): It's a fake!

ANNABELLE: Ice both knees and that shoulder before bed.
O'NEIL: I'll give you 50 thousand dollars for a bite of that steak! McGINTY Alright, listen up: There have been a lot of rumors about the regular players crossing the picket lines. They are not rumors. Many union players have now seen the error of their ways and are coming back in
MORRIS: (in Shane's ear)
SUMMERALL: If he can stay alive that long. Ten-three New York in what has turned out to be an incredible defensive duel.
LINDELL: ... because it's about brothers, and brotherhood and standing together against the oppressors. That's why I am so grateful to our Teamster brothers who have joined us here today in New York to protest the greed squad known as the N.F.L. owners.
SHANE: (to Reese Evans) You got to double up on Morris.
EVANS: He's too far outside for me to get to him. (to Cochran) Bring him down and sit on him.

PACIFICO: (smoking a butt) No problem.
SHANE: Seriously?
PACIFICO: (to Shane) You hold it. I'll kick it. McGINTY What the fuck.
MADDEN: I can't believe it! McGinty is gonna let Pacifico try the field goal from sixty-five yards out!
SUMMERALL: Hey, John, this kid has got a heck of a foot.
MADDEN    (V.O.): Pat... did he    just? I think that guy    is smoking on the    field!

SHANE: You look great, Lou, you know that?
LOU: Really? Thanks, Shane. That means a lot to me.
SHANE: Hut!
MADDEN (V.O.): It's straight enough! If it's got the distance, it's...
MADDEN (V.O.): Good!     Redskins win!

O'NEIL: You can pull it    off. You proved that    winning doesn't have to    look pretty. These     boys are hungry for it,    Jimmy.
O'NEIL (CONT'D): There's nothin' more dangerous in all of sports than a hungry team. I remember back in '47, we were playing Nebraska in the mud... McGINTY (interrupting) Ed, I'm begging you -- no Notre Dame stories.
O'NEIL: Okay, Jimmy, okay. But you beat Dallas for me, and then I'll go gently into that night.
LEE: You'll score, too, with a Cadillac from Coleman Cadillac. It's a big car for a big man.

DIRECTOR (O.S.): That's good, Mickey, that's real good. Let's try it again.

BUTLER: How's that side feel?
SHANE: (grimacing) Like Christmas morning. McGINTY What's the matter with your arm? Are you alright?
DAN: What pursuit! Butler never gave up on him. That's a 270-pound guy who moves like a halfback.
BOOMER: Dan, I think Butler's hit on Falco was late, to tell you the truth.
DAN: Well, of course you do. You were a wimp quarterback.
AL: Easy, guys.
SHANE: Okay.    Red right 15 X hook.
SHANE: 15 X hut!
LAMONT: Shane!
AL: That's the end of the
SHANE: Help me with this.
SHANE: Somebody has to tape me up.
AL (V.O.): ... at nine-forty Eastern time, the agreement was reached, and except for this upcoming second half, the strike is history.
DAN: It's about time. I say let the professionals back on the field. The fans deserve nothing less.
BOOMER: Yeah, you would say that.
ANNABELLE: Are you okay? Is it your side?
SHANE: I'm okay. I owe you an apology.
ANNABELLE: What?     You do?
SHANE: Yes. I'll explain later. But thank you for believing in me. You give me strength just looking at you.
AL (V.O.): Well, this is a first. Shane Falco seems to be...
BOOMER (V.O.): Hell,    Al, he's necking with    a cheerleader! I've    done a little of that    in my time.
DAN (V.O.): The players are not supposed to fraternize with the cheerleaders.
BOOMER (V.O.): Hey, Dan, what are they
BUTLER: That wasn't too smart.
SHANE: Suck my dick.
AL (V.O.): Here we go, first and ten for the Redskins. Twenty-four zip Dallas.
LINEBACKER: Are you ready for more
SHANE: Blue thirteen! Blue thirteen! Hut! Hut! Hut!
BUTLER: (to the Ref)
REF: Unsportsmanlike conduct, number 72, number 81 and number 87 on the offense, fifteen yards... (to himself) ... times three... that's forty-five yards. Illegal use of hands, number 48 on the offense, fifteen yards. That makes it sixty yards. Unnecessary roughness number 65 and number 32, fifteen yards... that's, wait... forty-five... no, thirty... (turns to another ref) ... how many yards so far?
SHANE: Okay, everybody, stick
BUTLER: I can't believe you went for my eyes!
COCHRAN: Shut up! I'm gonna do it again 'cause it was fun!
SHANE: Black 98! Black 98! Hut!
AL (V.O.): First and ten at the Cowboy twenty and I'm telling you, we are looking at a totally different team here in the second half.
BOOMER (V.O.): Absolutely, Al. The Redskins are playing like there's no tomorrow, because, hey, there isn't!
DAN (V.O.): I gotta agree with you on this one. The surprising thing for me is how ineffectual the Cowboys have been in this half. I mean, they look totally intimidated.
AL (V.O.): I love when you guys agree.
SHANE: Hut!   Hut!
AL (V.O.): Touchdown, Skins!     What a fluke!
BOOMER (V.O.): Total luck there, Al. Makes up for the perfect ones they drop.
DAN (V.O.): Maybe not so lucky. Falco is down.
DAN (V.O.): They just need to get the ball in field goal range.
AL (V.O.): And for Pacifico, that's anything up to sixty-five yards.
AL (V.O.): That's good for twelve yards. The clock stops on the first down. The Redskins have no time- outs left.
SHANE: I can do it.
AL (V.O.): Wilkinson throws it away, and with twelve seconds remaining, the Redskins will try a forty-eight yard field goal to tie it up. That's almost a chip shot for Pacifico.
EVANS: (to Shane) Are you okay?
SHANE: Just make it a good snap. (to Pacifico) And you'll do the rest, right?
SHANE: (to Pacifico) Lou, are you alright?
PACIFICO: I'm sorry. They know where my family lives.
SHANE: What?!
EVANS: (through his legs) Come on, Shane!
SHANE: Hut!
AL (V.O.): It's a fake! Falco has it!
AL (V.O.): Falco scores!
AL (V.O.): Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We've got a flag down.
REF: Clipping. Number 77 offense.
PACIFICO: I broke my arm. (big smile) Thank you. You saved my ass. McGINTY (V.O.) Someday, you can explain what that was all about. We got no
