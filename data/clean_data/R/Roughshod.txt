ROUGHSHOD: Written by Hugo Butler & Geoffrey Homes Peter Viertel
DISSOLVE: EXT. NARROW CANYON - DAWN MED. SHOT. A dry watercourse threads its way through the cut in the treeless hills. The sun is not high enough as yet to drive night from the canyon. A man appears around a bend; another and still another. They are McCall, Peters and Lednov, clad in prison clothes, hatless, their heads closely cropped. As Lednov's face comes into a closeup,
DISSOLVE: EXT. HILL - DAWN LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. A narrow valley lies below. Through it runs a cottonwood-bordered stream. Smoke curls up out of the trees. Horses graze in a small meadow near the creek. From O.O. comes the SOUND of heavy boots crunching across the dry, eroded earth. The three men file past camera to stop in the immediate F.g. and look down into the valley. They exchange glances and start down.
DISSOLVE: EXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAWN MED. SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH willows. A bearded man, Cal Forster, and two young fellows in their late teens squat beside a campfire eating breakfast. O.s. there is the SOUND of movement. Lednov moves cautiously into the scene. He has a revolver in his hand. Forster turns toward camera and fear comes into his expression. Lednov fires. Forster crumples near the fire. The two boys jump to their feet and reach for rifles. Lednov fires again and again. McCall and Peters come into the scene, both firing revolvers.
DISSOLVE: EXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAWN MED SHOT - ANGLED ACROSS campfire. On the fire smoulders the prison clothes the convicts had worn. Smoke spirals up. In the B.B. Lednov, Peters and McCall, now wearing the clothes of the three Forsters, saddle the horses. CAMERA PANS AROUND and ANGLES DOWN. The bodies of Forster and his sons, now clad in underwear are sprawled by the fire. Forster's arm lies close to the smouldering clothing.
DISSOLVE: EXT. CREEK - DAWN MED. LONG SHOT. Smoke climbs above the trees. Into the clearing ride the three convicts, to cross it and move westward. They disappear over the hill. A dust cloud marks their passage. CAMERA HOLDS ON the scene and over the shot comes the MAIN TITLE CARD:
ROUGHSHOD: EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY LONG SHOT. A buckboard drawn by two horses comes along the road. Graham, a middle-aged rancher, is driving. As the horses trot forward and dust rises above the road, the NEXT TITLE CARD is shown.
DISSOLVE: EXT. CREEK - DAY LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. Graham's buckboard moves down the road toward the clearing, as the TITLE CARDS follow and change. When the buckboard reaches the creek, the LAST TITLE CARD is ended.
DISSOLVE: EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY MED. LONG SHOT. The surrounding hills are covered with scrub pinon pine and mesquite. Graham's buckboard, moving slowly up a hill, passes camera, which PANS WITH it. In the bed, covered by a tarp, are the three bodies. The narrow, one-way road climbs easily up the gentle hill. Beyond, a dust cloud rises. As Graham's buckboard nears the crest, a surrey appears and starts down. Graham pulls his team into the bank, trying to make room for the surrey.
MED. SHOT: There are four women in the two-seated surrey, which is heavily loaded with trunks, hatboxes, etc. Mary Wells, the loveliest of the four, is driving. She is more poised, more self-assured than the others. Her clothes, though a trifle showy, are attractive. She wears a large spectacular hat. Helen Carter, showier, harder and more cynical, sits beside her. In the seat behind are Marcia Paine, placid, younger looking than her years, and Elaine Ross, a striking blonde with a pale haunted face. Elaine is obviously ill. Mary is riding the brake and holding the team back.
ANOTHER ANGLE: SHOOTING PAST Graham.
GRAHAM: ( annoyed ) What in thunderation ( calling ) Wait a minute stop
GRAHAM: All right What are you girls doin' way out Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
MARY: Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
GRAHAM: What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
MARY: ( dryly ) Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people. ( pointing ) Can I make it?
GRAHAM: Depends on how good you drive.
HELEN: She's a little out of practice.
GRAHAM: ( cheerfully ) Slide over.
HELEN: ( getting up ) I'm slidin' all the way over.
MARCIA: ( rising ) So am I. Come on Elaine.
ELAINE: ( flat ) What's the difference if we fall in the canyon.
MARCIA: Don't talk like that.
GRAHAM: Nothin' to it
GRAHAM: once you know how. Trouble is, never was a woman knew how to handle a team. Shouldn't let 'em loose on the roads. No disrespect meant, Miss Get up.
GRAHAM: Get up.
ANOTHER ANGLE: featuring buckboard. Helen and Marcia start along the road past the buckboard. Helen stops and looks at its cargo in horror. She grabs Marcia's arm. The girls look at each other and hurry after the surrey which has stopped below the MED. SHOT on surrey. Graham jumps out.
MED. SHOT: on surrey. Graham jumps out.
GRAHAM: There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
MARY: Thank you, Mr. Graham.
MARCIA: ( aghast ) There's dead men in your wagon!
GRAHAM: That's right. You had me so busy I Come to think of it you better turn around and drive right back to Aspen. They were murdered. I found the bodies on Alder Crick, northeast of here. Like I said if I was you, I'd go back, because the men who killed them might be on this road.
GRAHAM: They were murdered. I found the bodies on Alder Crick, northeast of here. Like I said if I was you, I'd go back, because the men who killed them might be on this road.
ELAINE: ( bitterly ) Back to what?
GRAHAM: Why, back to Aspen, where you came
MARY: Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
GRAHAM: ( distressed ) They shouldn't have done that.
MARY: We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
GRAHAM: ( sadly ) I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
MARY: Goodbye and thanks.
GRAHAM: I don't like to see you go.
GRAHAM: But that's the way it is. The live ones go out and the dead ones come
DISSOLVE: EXT. ASPEN - DAY - ( MATTE SHOT ) The town lies in a lush green valley. It is surrounded by meadowland and shaded by cottonwoods, alders and aspen. In the F.g. Graham's buckboard moves fast down hill.
DISSOLVE OUT: EXT. ASPEN STREET - DAY DISSOLVE IN FULL SHOT. In the F.g. a smallish crowd, mostly men and children idle in the street in front of Mary Wells' Gambling and Dance Hall. The wooden sidewalk is cluttered with those articles belonging to the women that were too bulky to get into the surrey. Several women stand on the porch supervising the locking up of the place and the removal of the sign of Mary Wells' name on it. Graham's buckboard rounds a corner at a fast trot. He slows the team to let the people get out of the way.
STEVE: How does she draw?
CLAY: A little hot.
SAM: You want to get out of here before noon, maybe you should lend me a
CLAY: Rate you're goin', we'll be here until winter.
SAM: ( amiably grumbling ) Account of you, I miss out on the only excitement Aspen's had for You're too old to watch such goin's And I'm too young.
CLAY: You're too old to watch such goin's And I'm too young.
STEVE: And I'm too young.
CLAY: That's right.
STEVE: I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to I don't either when people are that good-lookin'. Maybe that's why they were too good-lookin'. But there'll be others along to take their place after a while when this quiets down. And everything will be fine until some busybody starts stirring up trouble.
SAM: I don't either when people are that good-lookin'. Maybe that's why they were too good-lookin'. But there'll be others along to take their place after a while when this quiets down. And everything will be fine until some busybody starts stirring up trouble.
CLAY: ( mildly ) Don't you ever run down?
SAM: ( to Steve ) Some people just have to run other people's lives. Now take Clay. You want to amble up the street and see the fun and what does he say?
CLAY: ( good-natured ) You stick to your blacksmithin' and let me take care of Steve.
CLAY: We'll both take a look. Anything's better than listenin' to Sam. Don't forget to shoe the mule.
CLAY: Who are they?
MAN: Don't know. Graham brought 'em in.
GARDNER'S VOICE: Clay, come up here a minute.
MED. SHOT: Gardner is neatly dressed with his star hidden under his coat. His deputy wears jeans, shirt, and leather jacket.
CLAY: Hello Graham Joe Mr. Gardner.
GARDNER: Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
GRAHAM: ( motioning toward wagon ) Cal Forster and his sons. Somebody killed 'em.
GRAHAM: You know that cottonwood grove on Alder Crick? They must have been eatin' breakfast the way it looked, sittin' by the fire eatin' breakfast and when I got there nothin' but them lyin' dead in their underdrawers. No horses or guns or grub.
CLAY: ( shocked ) Forster never did anyone any harm. ( puzzled ) But what's that got to do with me? I came into town from the south.
GARDNER: This was smoulderin' on the fire.
CLAY: I still don't see. I got it day before yesterday.
GARDNER: I got it day before yesterday.
GARDNER: Now are you interested?
GARDNER: You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
CLAY: Maybe he did.
GARDNER: We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
CLAY: I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
GARDNER: ( dryly ) And that's more important than finding Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
CLAY: Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
GARDNER: ( with irony ) I'll drop the sheriff in Sonora a line to sort of look around for him.
CLAY: ANOTHER ANGLE As Clay starts away, Steve follows him. Clay doesn't cross to the blacksmith shop. He goes along the sidewalk toward the general store. Steve hurries to catch up with him.
ANOTHER ANGLE: As Clay starts away, Steve follows him. Clay doesn't cross to the blacksmith shop. He goes along the sidewalk toward the general store. Steve hurries to catch up with him.
STEVE: Who's Lednov?
CLAY: A man I used to know.
FULL SHOT: The store is a typical general store of the period, selling everything from buggies to baby clothes. In one corner is the postoffice. The storekeeper, Hayes, is unpacking a case of canned goods, stacking the cans on the shelf. Clay, followed by Steve, enters. Hayes glances over.
MED. SHOT: Clay crosses to the shelf where the rifle and shotgun shells are kept and takes down a half dozen boxes of 30 30
HAYES: Forget somethin', Clay?
CLAY: Shells. How much for six boxes?
HAYES: Six times six bits. But wait until I finish this.
STEVE: You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
CLAY: Like what?
STEVE: Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
CLAY: I don't want to run short.
STEVE: You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
CLAY: No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me. How's she feel?
STEVE: He pulls the hammer back and snaps the trigger. Hayes comes across and takes the gun from him.
HAYES: You know bettern' to do that, Steve. Unless you're figurin' on buyin' it.
CLAY: One he's got, more his size.
STEVE: But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
CLAY: The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
ANOTHER ANGLE: What was he in jail for?
STEVE: What was he in jail for?
CLAY: You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
STEVE: In a fight?
CLAY: The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
STEVE: This is an awful nice gun. Certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.
CLAY: ( points to rifle ) I may as well buy it for him. Otherwise he'll be crying all the way over the hill.
STEVE: You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us. Think he will?
CLAY: At the ranch maybe?
STEVE: At the ranch maybe?
CLAY: Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
STEVE: ( annoyed ) Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
CLAY: ( smiling ) All right. I'll tell you.
CLAY: Let's say this is the penitentiary.
CLAY: Here's Alder Crick. And here we are in Aspen.
CLAY: And here we are in Aspen.
CLAY: That's Sonora.
CLAY: motioning ) Lednov gets out of jail and comes along here to Alder Crick. Then goes along here toward the Sonora
CLAY: That's Lednov! We come along here.
STEVE: ( pointing ) And meet him there.
CLAY: Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
CLAY: So let's go.
STEVE: ( motioning ) Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
CLAY: Yeah and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
STEVE: He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
CLAY: He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
STEVE: He glances at the remaining piece of hardtack and then pitches it away.
STEVE: I don't like him.
DISSOLVE: EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY CLOSE SHOT. A woman's hat lies on the rocky earth. It is a big, elaborate affair. O.s. there is the SOUND of hoofbeats, the SQUEAL of a wagon brake and the JANGLE of harness. CAMERA PULLS BACK and ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Clay's wagon coming down a very steep hill. Steve is driving, holding tightly to the reins and riding the brake. Seeing the hat, he yells to Clay rides over and, swinging down, picks it up.
STEVE: Another one, Clay.
MED. SHOT: ANGLED DOWN hill. The road twists tortuously down. Near the bottom it swings sharply at right angles into a dry wash. The banks shut out further view of the road. Near where the road turns a trunk lies at the side. It has broken open and some of the contents are spilled out in the dust. Clay rides to it, reins in his horse and looks down. Steve, with difficulty, pulls the mules to a stop alongside.
ANOTHER ANGLE: featuring trunk and wagon. Clay swings out of his saddle, starts tossing the clothes back in the trunk. Steve jumps
STEVE: They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
CLAY: Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
STEVE: I'd look good doin' the ploughin' in
MED. SHOT: on surrey. The back wheel is broken and the bed of the surrey rests on the ground. The horses have been taken from the traces and stand dejectedly in the hot sun. A blanket is spread in the scant shade thrown by the surrey. On it lies Elaine and, sitting beside her, is Marcia. A damp cloth is spread across Elaine's forehead. A water bag hangs from the surrey. Elaine's head is pillowed on a dainty satin cushion. Helen and Mary have risen at Clay's approach and now stand by the road.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Clay gallops forward to pull up near the surrey. In the b.g. Steve drives the wagon around the bend. Clay dismounts.
CLAY: Anybody hurt?
MARY: No. We came down the hill a little fast and. .the wheel broke. Can you fix it for us?
CLAY: What's the matter with her?
MARY: ( dryly ) Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
ANOTHER ANGLE: on rear of surrey. In the B.g. Steve pulls the wagon to a stop, jumps off, and comes running over.
STEVE: Jimininy. You sure were lucky, just bustin' a wheel.
HELEN: ( rubbing thigh ) You think that'sall we busted You should see.
CLAY: This must have been in the family a long time.
MARY: ( dryly ) It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
MARY: And this is Helen Carter.

STEVE: ( shy ) Pleased to meet you, ma'am. ( brightly ) We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
MARY: I was at first. Then I was hanging Are you going far?
CLAY: Yes, ma'am.
MARY: As far as Sonora?
CLAY: Just about.
MARY: We're going to Sonora, too, so that solves everything. We can ride in your wagon.
MARY: We can ride in your wagon.
MARY: We wouldn't think of asking you to take us for nothing.
MARY: There's only four of us.
CLAY: I've got eleven horses.
STEVE: ( proudly ) Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
MARY: They won't be riding in the wagon.
CLAY: ( dryly ) Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
MARY: You can't leave us here.
CLAY: Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
MARY: What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
CLAY: ( amiably ) You can stay here if you like.
MARY: We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
CLAY: I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
CLAY: When you're old enough to smoke, I'll tell you. Get the horses started on ahead, will you, Steve?
HELEN: Afraid it will stop him growin'?
CLAY: ( turning ) Let's get your stuff in the wagon. Like I said, I'll take you to the first ranch. I wish I could carry you all the way, but I can't. It's a tough trip and women would be in the ( dryly ) Our kind of women?
MARY: ( dryly ) Our kind of women?
CLAY: ( ignores that ) You'll have to drive except down
HELEN: Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works. Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
MARY: Maybe in Sonora.
CLAY: What's the matter with her?
MARY: ( dryly ) Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
ANOTHER ANGLE: on rear of surrey. In the B.g. Steve pulls the wagon to a stop, jumps off, and comes running over. Elaine stands for a moment, searching the ground with her eyes.
STEVE: Jiminy. You sure were lucky, just bustin' a wheel.
HELEN: ( rubbing thigh ) You think that's all we busted You should see.
MARY: ( sees Elaine ) Now where's she goin'?
ELAINE: ( half-turns without stopping ) I lost something.
CLAY: It wouldn't happen to be this.
MARY: Who's the old folks?
ELAINE: ( frantic ) Give it to me!

MARY: Come on, Honeybunch. We're changing
MARY: A nice, kind wrangler is letting us ride in his wagon.
MARY: .as far as the first ranch. From then on
ELAINE: What ranch?
MARY: What's the difference?
ELAINE: ( fierce ) Ask him what ranch
MARY: There's plenty of time for that. Come on, now. You've got to lie down out of this sun. Stop worrying. I'll find out what ranch after a while.
MED. SHOT: on wagon. Clay, in the wagon bed, is stowing his gear in the back. Mary, supporting Elaine, reaches the wagon. Seeing the girls, Clay reaches down and gently lifts Elaine up. Mary climbs in beside him.
MED. CLOSE: wagon bed. Clay has unrolled a bedroll under the seat where there is a little shade.
CLAY: ( kind ) Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
ELAINE: ( desperate ) Which ranch?
CLAY: How's that?
MARY: She's worried about where you're taking us.
MARY: ( dryly ) So am I.
CLAY: It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
CLOSE SHOT: Elaine as she hears the name. She is shocked.
CLAY'S VOICE: They'll take you in until you can make other arrangements.
TWO SHOT: Clay and Mary. Clay vaults out of the wagon, CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS, he looks up.
CLAY: So both of you stop worrying.
DISSOLVE: EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY FULL SHOT. Dust rises over the road as the cavalcade moves forward. Clay, rifle across his lap, rides in front. The wagon, with Mary driving and Helen beside her on the seat, follows. The two horses that pulled the surrey are tied to the tail gate. Then comes the remuda with Steve bringing up the rear.
CLOSE SHOT: Marcia and Elaine. PROCESS. Marcia sits in the bed of the wagon looking back. Elaine lies under the seat.
CLOSE SHOT: Steve. Steve proudly carries his new rifle across his lap. He whistles happily as he scans the desert country hopefully for the enemy.
CLAY'S VOICE: Steve, see the horses don't drink too much
STEVE: Leave that unharnessing for me, Ma'am.
CLAY: There's a place down a ways, where you and the girls can wash some of that dust off.
MARY: Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper or making the Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
CLAY: ( half-smile ) Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
MARY: ( curt ) But you eat, don't you?
CLAY: Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
MARY: Where do you keep the can opener?
CLAY: In the grub box. Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
MARY: Marcia all of you. Come on.
MED. SHOT: ANGLED PAST wagon. Clay tosses the saddle into the wagon bed, slaps his mare on the rump. She trots off. Climbing up on the wheel, he gets the grub box under the seat and lifts it down. Steve comes from out of scene and starts unharnessing the team.
STEVE: ( trying to be casual ) Where'd they go?
CLAY: Clay comes past him, carrying the grub box. He puts it down near where some stones make a crude firebox.
STEVE: It's sort of nice having company along. Not so lonesome.
CLAY: When you get the team watered, rustle up some wood.
MED. SHOT: ANGLED PAST Clay. In the B.g. Steve stands by the stream, letting the team drink. O.s. the women can be heard laughing and splashing. Steve gives all his attention to what is going on downstream. Clay puts wood on the fire, opens the grub box. He sees Steve, takes the coffee pot out of the box and heads for the stream.
STEVE: ( to mules ) You boys have had enough.
MED. SHOT: on wagon and fire. As Clay passes the wagon, he reaches into the bed and gets a couple of strips of scrap iron. These he carries to the fire. He puts the iron strips across the blaze, sets the coffee pot on, feeds the fire with some more wood, then going back to the wagon, he takes his rifle out, throws a shell into the chamber and starts off up the knoll.
DISSOLVE: EXT. KNOLL - NIGHT MED. SHOT. It is a moonlight night. Clay squats on his heels, smoking. The rifle lies across his knees. Below can be seen the campfire, and the shadowy forms of the girls as with Steve's help they make up a bed under the wagon and cook the evening meal. Clay suddenly reacts as O.s. a horse whinnies. Standing he looks off into the darkness.
LONG SHOT: ANGLED PAST Clay. In the moonlight the trail stretches back over rolling hills. Faintly can be heard the SOUND of hoofbeats. Below, where the remuda grazes, a horse whinnies again. Clay moves down toward the camp.
MED. SHOT: the camp. As Clay approaches. Steve squats by the fire. He has spread out a tarp in the circle of firelight and Mary is setting the tin plates, cups, etc., out. Elaine, a blanket around her, sits near the fire. She looks tired and ill. Marcia and Helen are struggling with bed-making under the Steve and Mary look up as Clay strides up. Clay starts kicking dirt over the fire.
HELEN'S VOICE: And I'm the girl who used to complain to my mother about helping with the
CLAY: Get your rifle.
CLAY: ( calling ) Hold it.
ANOTHER ANGLE: on road. The man, now seen clearly for the first time, stops. He is Jim Clayton, a man in his twenties, chunky, round-faced, stolid and not too imaginative. He wears the well-worn jeans and blue shirt of the farmer. Clay and Steve come out of the willows toward him. Both have their rifles ready.
CLAY: Drop your gun.
CLAYTON: ( mildly ) Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
CLAY: Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
CLAYTON: A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for

HELEN: ( quietly ) Looks like we lose a good piano
MARCIA: ( happily ) Jim came after me, Mary.
MARY: ( dryly ) I see he did.
HELEN: With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
MARY: ( sharp ) Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always I've got a chance to get married.
MARCIA: I've got a chance to get married.
MARY: ( quickly ) That's what I'm gettin' at. It never works. Don't forget we were thrown out of Aspen.
MARCIA: Jim doesn't care, do you, Jim?
MARY: But Jim isn't the only one you're marrying. He has folks and friends. What are they going to say? And how're they going to feel? I tell you, it won't work.
CLAY: Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
MARY: ( ignoring him ) And look at it this way. How about Jim it puts him in a sort of tough I know what I'm doing. My folks got nothin' to do with it
JIM: I know what I'm doing. My folks got nothin' to do with it
MARY: You've talked this over with them?
JIM: They know about Marcia.
MARY: ( quickly ) And they don't like the idea!
CLAY: Suppose they don't. This is his problem. He's over twenty-one. He wants to marry Marcia and Marcia wants to marry him so let 'em alone.
TWO SHOT: Clay and Mary. The others in the b.g.
MARY: If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
CLAY: I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
STEVE: ( friendly ) I would!
CLAY: ( hurriedly; smiles ) Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
MARY: Would you, Mr. Phillips?
CLAY: ( to Steve ) Go on, there's a good boy.
MARY: ( bitter ) Don't you want him to hear your answer? Well, I know what it is. For the other fellow it's all right but not you. All you want is to get rid of one of us.
JIM: Wait a minute.
JIM: No need of you two arguin' about this. We know what we want to do, and nothin' either of you says makes any difference. We want to go home Will you sell me one of your horses?
CLAY: I'm sorry. I can't do that. I went a long way to get those horses.
JIM: All right, we'll ride double. Come on, Marcia.
ANOTHER ANGLE: featuring Marcia and Jim. In the B.g. Mary comes after them.
MARY: No need to do that, Marcia.
MARY: We've got two horses and they're four of us. So half of one of 'em is The other half's a wedding present.
MARY: Big-hearted fella. Can't see young love thwarted especially if it makes one less girl to worry about. That's all you really want, isn't
DISSOLVE: EXT. CAMP SITE - NIGHT MED. SHOT. Mary stands in the moonlight by the wagon, looking out across the meadow. Below, near the creek, the horses graze. There is the soft jangle of a bell as the bell mare moves her head. Clay comes walking up from the creek, rifle in hand. He passes without noticing Mary. Mary turns.
REVERSE SHOT: Mary in close F.g. The campfire burns low. Steve lies on his stomach close to it. Clay stops beside him to glance down, then moves on to sit on a rock above the fire. Mary starts toward the fire.
MED. CLOSE: Steve. Open in front of him is a copy of Leslie's Weekly, a woman's journal: pictures of baby basinettes, whale-bone corsets, fancy oil lamps, etc. Mary comes into scene to stand above him, looking down. Steve glances up and smiles.
MARY: Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
STEVE: I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
MED. SHOT: ANGLED DOWN PAST Clay.
MARY: You can't read?
MARY: Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
STEVE: Since I can remember, Ma'am.
MARY: But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
CLOSE SHOT: Clay. He listens, perturbed.

CLAY: ( quiet ) He doesn't know his letters, no but he knows the names of animals. he knows what roots to eat when you're clear out of food. He knows the difference between a possum and a coon just by lookin' at the tracks. more than most trappers know. and he can tell whether she'll rain or shine tomorrow by smelling the air tonight. There's a lot of things he doesn't know, I hope he'll never

STEVE: ( flat ) I won't again.
ANOTHER ANGLE: One of the horses strays out of line and Clay rides out and gets the animal back in the road. Then he returns to Steve.
CLAY: This isn't like other trips we've taken. For one thing, we've got a wagonload of women. For another there's a guy wanderin' around hopin' to put a bullet in my back.
STEVE: Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.

STEVE: Oh. that's the time you went away.
CLAY: ( nods ) I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and that's the story.
STEVE: ( looking off ) Maybe you shoulda killed him.
CLAY: Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.

DISSOLVE: EXT. WYATT RANCH - DAY LONG SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH gate in barbed wire fence. The ranch is nestled in a valley at the base of the Sierras. Green meadowland surrounds the farm buildings which consist of a cabin, barn and sheds, all in good repair and white- washed, as are the corral fences and the picket fence around the house, which stands in a clump of trees. The wind has pushed the clouds back over the hills, but far off there is still thunder. The gate in front f.g. is of barbed wire. It is closed. On the fence post a board is tacked. Neatly lettered on the board is the name:
ED WYATT: From o.s. comes the SOUND of horses moving restlessly and the creaking of saddle leather, as a man swings out of the saddle. Footsteps approach. A man's head and shoulders, back to camera, comes into scene. He unloops the strand of bailing wire and lets the gate fall open, then turns and we see his face. He is Lednov. His cheek and jowls have a dark growth of beard. He wears a black leather jacket and a wrangler's grey hat. The clothes Forster was wearing. As he moves back to his horse, CAMERA PULLS BACK and PANS AROUND. His companions, McCall and Peters, also wear black leather jackets, sombre, dusty pants and hats. They are mounted on matched roans. The horses are winded, lathered and dirty. It is obvious they have ridden hard. Lednov strides forward and as he reaches for the reins the horse shies away. Brutally he jerks on the reins. The horse rears. He snatches his hat from his head and whacks the horse across the nose. McCall rides over and grabs the reins. Lednov scrambles into the MED. SHOT ANGLED TOWARD gate. Lednov rides forward through the gate. His horse is limping badly. The others follow. They do not stop to put the gate back up.

WYATT: That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
LEDNOV: Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
WYATT: ( frightened, bewildered ) All right, but it won't do much good.
ANOTHER ANGLE: As Lednov and Peters start for the house, Mrs. Wyatt, a woman of about fifty, small, plump, browned from the sun and hard from work, comes out on the porch. She has taken off her apron and holds it in her hand. She smiles at the two men.
MED. SHOT: ANGLED PAST Mrs. Wyatt. She starts down the steps as Lednov and Peters come up.
MRS. WYATT: I was up to my elbows in flour when you boys rode up, that's why I din't come out sooner. I hope Ed asked you to stay the night?

LEDNOV: ( to Ed ) Get on about your chores. ( to Mrs. Wyatt ) And hurry that grub up.
DISSOLVE OUT: EXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT DISSOLVE IN MED. SHOT. Here the trail starts down into the valley. From o.s. comes the SOUND of the cavalcade approaching. Clay rides into the scene and stops on the hilltop to glance ahead.

MCCALL: I'll have some more of that coffee.
LEDNOV: We got to get movin'.
MCCALL: What for?
LEDNOV: Because there's a man I want to see.
MCCALL: He can wait. Let's stay here until
LEDNOV: ( rising ) I said let's go.
MCCALL: ( protesting ) One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
LEDNOV: ( fierce ) I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
LEDNOV: He gave me something once so I wouldn't forget.
PETERS: ( rising ) He says go, we go.

MED. SHOT: Turning from the bed, she crosses to the dresser. Beside the dresser is a camel-back trunk. She starts to open a dresser drawer, pauses and looks down at the trunk. Moving to the trunk, she hesitates. Then making up her mind, she bends down and throws open the trunk.
WYATT: ( cold ) Put it back. Someone might as well get some good out of it. Wyatt crosses to the trunk.
MRS. WYATT: Someone might as well get some good out of it. Wyatt crosses to the trunk.

MARY: No, thanks. I hope we won't be a burden to them.
CLAY: I hope so, too.
CLAY: ( quiet ) If you're figuring on asking me to take you, it's no use.
MARY: A time like this people ought to be alone. Having us around is going to make it sort of hard on 'em.
CLAY: ( on the defensive ) I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
MARY: I suppose it is.
CLAY: And it's not only because the trip's a tough one

HELEN: Clay could save us an awful lot of He certainly could. About a month.
MARY: He certainly could. About a month.

HELEN: ( sharp ) You're not giving up?

HELEN: Look at you, sitting up already.
HELEN: Let me do this while you get some But I like to do it.

ELAINE: It isn't that
HELEN: Don't talk eat we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
ELAINE: But I want to stay.
HELEN: Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself. Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
ELAINE: ( distraught ) I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
HELEN: Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
ELAINE: ( sobbing ) Stop it stop it.
HELEN: ( contrite ) Darling now I've got you all upset.
ELAINE: Go away please.

ELAINE: ( fiercely ) She mustn't don't you let her
HELEN: There, there. Don't you upset yourself
ELAINE: ( wildly ) If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
ELAINE: ( sobbing ) I don't want to leave you, ever.

HELEN: Nothing. The poor child's worried about Mary
HELEN: I won't let her say anything
CLAY: Well, I'm off What's the matter? Don't let them stay here, Mr. Phillips. They'll spoil everything.
MED. SHOT: ( puzzled ) What's the matter? Don't let them stay here, Mr. Phillips. They'll spoil everything.

STEVE: ( happily ) Then I know my alphabet.
MARY: From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Clay comes toward the wagon. Helen stands on the porch.
STEVE: And that's tough, isn't it?
MARY: Without someone to teach you, it's
MARY: He knows his alphabet.
CLAY: That's fine.
STEVE: I'll bet I'd be reading in a week if
MARY: Maybe Clay will take up where I left
STEVE: I don't think it's fair
STEVE: Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And and they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
CLAY: Finished, son?
STEVE: ( weakly ) There's only two of them now.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Clay's horse stands saddled at the fence. He vaults into the saddle, turns the horse.

DISSOLVE: EXT. WYATT RANCH LONG SHOT - the wagon, followed by the remuda and with Clay riding ahead moves slowly up the canyon back of the ranch.
FADE OUT: EXT. FOREST TRAIL - DAY FADE IN LONG SHOT - ANGLED WEST. The forest is fairly open, yellow pine, lodgepole and fir. To the West can be seen the bald red granite domes of the higher range. O.s. there is the SOUND of the cavalcade approaching. CAMERA PANS AROUND and ANGLES PAST. Toward camera, comes the cavalcade, climbing slowly. Far in the distance and down can be seen the waste of desert and the barren hills of Nevada. Clay, a rifle across his legs, is riding on one side of the wagon. Steve rides beside Mary, who is driving. The remuda trails behind. Helen, lying in the wagon bed, cannot be seen.
STEVE: It's a lot tougher than I figured. Knowin' my letters is one thing. But makin' sense out of words is harder'n trackin' weasel after rain.
STEVE: and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
MARY: There's plenty of use for reading you'll see.
STEVE: U-n-i-c-o-r-n-. What in heck's Unicorn a kind of animal
MARY: Unicorn a kind of animal
STEVE: What do they look like?
MARY: Hmmm. sort of like a horse with a horn in the center of its forehead.
STEVE: Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
MARY: How about California?
STEVE: How about California?
MARY: Would they be good to eat?
MARY: ( not too sure ) Kind of tough, I guess. But you're not liable to hunt them I don't think there's any alive now, anyways and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were.
STEVE: Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?.
STEVE: An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
MARY: You don't read to fill your stomach. Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal but they make you feel good.
STEVE: ( stubbornly ) I feel good anyways.
REVERSE SHOT: ANGLED PAST Clay.
CLAY: Don't go arguing with your teacher.
STEVE: I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
CLAY: There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or go back and watch the horses.

STEVE: ( softly ) You were worryin'.
STEVE: Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em And you've got me all figured out?
MARY: And you've got me all figured out?
STEVE: They have passed Helen, playing solitaire on the canvas, and have reached the place where the grub box stands. Steve spreads a tarp for her.
STEVE: I'll fix us somethin' to eat.
STEVE: Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
MARY: You were supposed to be reading words.
STEVE: I was doin' both. Here. Thanks, Steve. Better not let Clay catch you waitin' on us.

MARY: But you're his brother.
STEVE: He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other
STEVE: Yes sir, Clay's nice to be around. He don't chew much and when he does he spits outside.
HELEN: ( dryly ) You make him sound wonderful. Go on. Tell Mary more about him.
MARY: She was only teasin'.

MED. SHOT: As the wagon comes abreast, Clay dismounts, loops the reins over the tail gate, then swings up into the seat, motioning for Mary to move over. He takes the reins, puts his rifle down in front of him.
MARY: Don't you trust me?
CLAY: Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
MARY: I like to see where I'm going.
CLAY: ( dryly ) Did you ever care where you were goin' or where you'd been?
MARY: Maybe not! But I want to get there in one piece.
MARY: ( softly ) Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
CLAY: Why do you think?
MARY: ( soberly ) I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
CLAY: Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
MARY: Just how do you mean that?
CLAY: You know so much about me figure it out.
MARY: So that's it You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
CLOSE SHOT: Helen. She lies in the bed of the wagon, looking up.
MARY'S VOICE: I wasn't. And I wasn't making fun of you or your dream.
MARY'S VOICE: Of course, maybe I was trying to get you to do something you didn't want to do.

CLAY: Neither do we. That's why we took this trail instead of the main road, and drove all night.
FOWLER: You're welcome to use my camp.
DISSOLVE: EXT. MEADOW FULL SHOT. The river is beyond the meadow. In the pine forest at the edge of the meadow is Fowler's camp. The cavalcade is driving up to the camp. There are two horses tethered in the EXT. FOWLER'S CAMP MED. FULL SHOT. A tarp is stretched over the camp. There is a crude stone fireplace, a rough table and two benches. Shelves are nailed between the trees. In a small lean-to there is a bunk with Fowler's bedroll on it. Fowler stands watching Mary and Holen as they get out of the wagon. The horses sproad out across the meadow. Steve and Clay dismount. Both unsaddle. Helen, Mary and Fowler exchange glances. Then the two women walk toward the camp, which is behind a screen of trees.
MARY: We might as well start a fire.
HELEN: Go ahead. Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
MARY: Got a light?

STEVE: ( innocently ) Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
CLAY: ( upset ) Just the grub box and bed rolls.
STEVE: I I think it'll be swell.
MED. CLOSE: Clay, embarrassed, puts his hand on the boy's shoulder.
CLAY: When you get older you'll understand things better. Like women and men. Just because a man kisses a woman, doesn't always mean well, he can kiss her and not want to have her around all the time.
CLAY: We got a lot to do, you and I. Gettin' that ranch started and everything. We've been getting along fine, all these years. For a while I want to keep it the way it is. Take that in and help her get breakfast, will you?

HELEN: What is it?
FOWLER: Just a thing I was workin' on.
HELEN: The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
FOWLER: Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
HELEN: You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
HELEN: She turns to the toilet case on the sand beside her, takes out a comb. He glances at the box, then reaches over and from it takes her powder box. He sniffs it. Without irritation, as though borrowing a toy from a child, Helen takes the powder box from him.
FOWLER: That sure smells good.
HELEN: I like it.
FOWLER: Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
HELEN: Then why stay in the hills.
HELEN: That why? I guess you can keep a secret. That's a gold rocker. I'm doin' a little placer mining in a place nobody ever thought to look for gold before.

DISSOLVE: EXT. MEADOW CLOSE SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. Mary is asleep in the shade of a pine. She lies on a tarp using a folded blanket for a pillow. It is very quiet. She stirs, opens her eyes. Her expression changes. A soft smile plays around her lips as CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS and we see Clay sitting near her, leaning against the bole of a pine. He isn't looking at her. Mary watches him for a moment.
MARY: ( softly ) Roll me a cigarette, Clay.
MARY: She still holds his hand. They look at each other.

MARY: I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
MARY: I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
CLAY: If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.

MARY: Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like
HELEN: You're sure there's more where this came from?

HELEN: Pretty, isn't it? And all you have to do is shovel sand into a thing and the river does the work.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Clay enters the scene and goes over to pick up his saddle
MARY: ( quiet ) Give it back to him. We're leavin'.

HELEN: Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia Elaine me all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry
MARY: I'm not raising horses or kids for anybody. I'm opening the slickest gambling house in California with a crystal chandelier, the biggest you ever saw
MARY: Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
HELEN: Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
HELEN: I'm sure of this. But not of you. You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
MARY: ( furious ) That's it then.
FOWLER: ( the master ) That's it. She's staying with me for keeps.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Steve has entered the camp and is standing looking at them open-mouthed. Mary moves over to Fowler and holds out her
MARY: If there were more men like you, there wouldn't be so many of us.
FOWLER: It's nice to meet a man who doesn't want to own a woman from the day she was born. I never had the luck. The only kind I've run into were tramps or dirty-minded hypocrites.

MARY: For the wagon.
MARY: Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
CLAY: ( furious ) There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
CLAY: Don't just stand there. Go on back and get the packs on the horses. We've lost all the time we're going to because of a woman.

LEDNOV: Suppose I take a look.
FOWLER: Go ahead.
MCCALL: Looking for something?
LEDNOV: Hold it, Mac.

REVERSE SHOT: Peters stands in front of her. As he reaches out for her, she tries to get away. He grabs her, wrapping his arms around EXT. CAMP - NIGHT MED. SHOT. From o.s. comes the SOUND of Helen and Peters struggling. Fowler, hearing the SOUND, gets to his feet. Lednov and McCall turn on him.
LEDNOV: Sit down. All right, Peters, come on over here.
LEDNOV: ( to Fowler ) So you were all alone.
PETERS: ( sharp ) You keep your hands off.
HELEN: ( yelling ) Let him alone!
HELEN: Kick a guy, would you! You scum! You won't do any kickin' when they come
HELEN: You dirty murderers. killin' people when they're sleepin'.
LEDNOV: How do you know who we are?
HELEN: Everybody knows
LEDNOV: ( excited ) Who brought you here?
LEDNOV: You said somebody was comin' back who's comin' back?
HELEN: ( moaning ) Stop it
HELEN: Clay Phillips.
LEDNOV: Where is he?
HELEN: Up the trail.
LEDNOV: How far up the trail?
HELEN: ( moaning ) I don't know I don't know.
PETERS: ( huskily ) You didn't have to do that.
LEDNOV: ( deadly ) Why not? She might have got to Clay Phillips before I did.
FADE OUT: EXT. OPEN RIDGE FADE IN MED. FULL SHOT - ANGLES east. Behind the ridge rises the range through which the pass to Nevada cuts its way. The trail which has dipped down into a canyon comes up to follow the ridge a ways and then drops down again. Lednov, McCall and Peters ride along the trail. Lednov, in the lead, stops suddenly and looks off.
MED. SHOT: McCall, Lednov and Peters. Lednov motions to his men and they hurriedly ride forward into the shelter of some trees.
MED. SHOT: the pack train. Mary, half asleep, slumps forward. Her horse has stopped. Steve rides up alongside and looks over at her, Mary starts into wakefulness. She smiles at Steve.
STEVE: Are you all right?
MARY: For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
STEVE: It's a long ways yet. I figure we ought to camp. She's So am I and so are the horses.
CLAY: So am I and so are the horses.
CLAY: ( to Steve ) Take the packs off. And run the horses into the corral.
CLAY: I said take the packs off.
CLAY: ( gruffly ) I figure we'll make better time, letting the horses rest for a spell.
CLAY: So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
MARY: If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
CLAY: Like I said, I was thinkin' of the
MED. SHOT: Steve and Mary. Steve spreads a tarp on the grass.
STEVE: You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
MARY: ( sitting ) Thanks, Steve.
LONG SHOT: his ANGLE. The open ridge. There is no sign of Lednov.
MED. SHOT: Steve squats beside the pile of needles, twigs and pine cones. He strikes a match and sets the needles aflame. Clay hurries into the scene and roughly kicks the fire out. Steve rises.
CLAY: ( angrily ) If you want 'em to find us, why don't you go up on the hill and wave your shirt or fire your rifle. I didn't stop to think, Clay.
STEVE: I didn't stop to think, Clay.
CLAY: ( short ) You better start.
CLOSE SHOT: Steve. He is hurt and angry. Knowing he was in the wrong about the fire doesn't help matters. He'd like to go off in the woods and cry, but that's out of the question. Instead he follows Clay and stands above him.
STEVE: Maybe you and me better split up when we hit Sonora.
CLAY: ( mildly ) All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own
STEVE: That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own
CLAY: Maybe you're not hungry, but I am.
CLAY: Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
STEVE: I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
CLAY: Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
STEVE: What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
ANOTHER ANGLE: SHOOTING TOWARD Steve and Clay PAST Mary. She is asleep.
STEVE: You ain't even man enough to own up when you're wrong.
STEVE: Go on, hit me.
CLAY: Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
STEVE: You oughta say you're sorry that's what you oughta do.
CLAY: You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
STEVE: Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
CLAY: I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
STEVE: You think you're so slmighty smart Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday just because a man kisses a woman
LONG SHOT: her ANGLE. Over the rise comes the stage. It is still a long way off.
STEVE'S VOICE: doesn't mean he wants to marry
ANOTHER ANGLE: to include all three. The brothers still don't see Mary.
STEVE: Well, if you didn't mean it, why did you kiss her?
CLAY: Shut up and eat.
MARY: ( sharply ) Stop it both of you.
MARY: I won't have you fighting over me.
CLAY: ( to Steve ) I'm sorry.
STEVE: You don't know what it is to be sorry.
MARY: ( sharp ) ( to Clay ) Mind sortin' out my things I'm
MARY: ( to Clay ) Mind sortin' out my things I'm
LONG SHOT: FROM his ANGLE. The stage drives along the road.
MARY: Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
CLAY: It's going to Sonora.
MARY: Fine maybe I'll see you there
MARY: Because as you said, that's where I
CLAY: I said a lot of things some of
CLOSE SHOT: Clay. He looks up anxiously, then turns. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to include Mary and she straightens and faces him, her back to the trail.
MARY: Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
CLAY: ( sharply ) I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
CLAY: If you're gonna catch this stage, come on.
ANOTHER ANGLE: The stage has speeded up and is coming fast down the road. Mary looks up at Clay hurt and shocked by his sudden sharpness. She had hoped he wouldn't let her go.
MARY: I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
CLAY: Hurry up.
MARY: ( softly ) I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
CLAY: Maybe they will.
MED. SHOT: The stage. It is a small one, a double-seated buckboard with one woman passenger and the driver an elderly man. On the side of the vehicle is painted: "Yosemite-Sonora Stage Line". The woman, middle-aged and rather drab, looks at Mary
CLAY: Mind giving a lady a lift into town?
DRIVER: ( to Mary ) Climb right in.
ANOTHER ANGLE: on back of stage. The driver opens the boot and Clay hands him Mary's belongings. He starts stowing them in the boot.
CLAY: Will you be seeing the sheriff?
DRIVER: Depot's right next to his office.
MED. CLOSE: featuring Mary and Steve.
STEVE: ( shyly ) Goodbye, ma'am.
MARY: ( quietly ) Goodbye, Steve. Don't fight with him any more.
MARY: It's not his fault, just you remember that. It's mine. Don't ask me why because you couldn't understand now. Some day you will. Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
MARY: Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
CLAY: Goodbye, Mary.
MARY: By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with
MED. CLOSE: as Clay reaches the spot where the kyacks and saddles are thrown. Steve comes up to him.
STEVE: You know what she asked me?
CLAY: I don't care what she asked you.
STEVE: She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but I figure different.
STEVE: It is so your fault and. and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch. you andme better.
CLAY: ( sharply ) You want to split up?
MED. CLOSE: Clay and Steve as Clay turns sharply.
CLAY: Why wait? Go on, saddle up now and beat it.
STEVE: Half of them are mine.
CLAY: ( hard ) You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
CLAY: There you are.
MED. CLOSE: the two brothers. They stare at each other. Steve is on the verge of tears. Hurriedly, he swings into the saddle.
MED. SHOT: He glances down to Clay and digs his spurs in and gallops after the stage. Clay's stern expression leaves his face. He looks after the boy, smiles softly and then starts carrying the pack-saddle into the shelter of the forest.
CLOSE SHOT: Steve as he stares. Then understanding his brother's actions, he jerks the reins and swings the horse around and rides back toward the meadow.
MED. CLOSE: Clay. He looks over toward Steve, then rises and hurries toward him.
MED. CLOSE: Clay and Steve. Steve takes down the bars and puts the horse in the corral. Clay comes up to him as he's putting the bars back up.
CLAY: What did you come back for?
STEVE: Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
CLAY: ( softly ) Is that the only reason you came ( gruff ) Sure. What other reason would there ( smiling ) I just wondered. Let's go.
STEVE: ( gruff ) Sure. What other reason would there ( smiling ) I just wondered. Let's go.
CLAY: ( smiling ) I just wondered. Let's go.
REVERSE SHOT: Lednov stands on a rocky hill looking down in the meadow. Behind him are McCall and Peters. They are screened from the meadow by the rocks. Lednov turns and starts off through the rocks to circle above the camp. The two men follow. All are on foot.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Below Clay, Steve lies in a cut in the rocks, watching the camp. Clay motions toward the hill. Steve nods.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Below is the camp. Lednov motions.
LEDNOV: ( to Peters ) Go on down and have a look.
PETERS: ( scoffing ) And get my head blown off! Not me.
MCCALL: Call it.
PETERS: McCall flips the coin, shows it to Peters. Peters shrugs and starts moving cautiously down toward the camp.
MED. CLOSE: Lednov and McCall.
LEDNOV: And you! Get going.
ANOTHER ANGLE: His position commands the meadow, where the horses are corralled, and the camp.

Clay looks off in the direction where Lednov is waiting on the hill west of the camp. Another SHOT is heard. A bullet smacks into the rock close to Clay. It comes from McCall's position southwest of the camp. Clay ducks.
CLAY: ( quietly ) Stick here.
LEDNOV: ( calling ) Come on out, Phillips.
CLOSE SHOT: Lednov. He ducks lower, steadies his rifle.
LEDNOV: ( his voice echoing ) Those horses down there they don't amount to much to me. Look at the one with the bell.
LONG SHOT: ANGLED THROUGH sights. The sights center on the bell mare.
LEDNOV: ( calling; echoing ) Next time I won't miss.
CLOSE SHOT: Clay. He starts forward, face set with rage.
LEDNOV'S VOICE: ( echoing ) Watch the one with the white face.
MED. CLOSE: Steve. He lies still a moment, then painfully he crawls to the rails and with a great effort tries to tear the rails down. Lednov fires. The bullet whistles past. Steve pulls the fence down, crawls away from the opening. The horses, milling around the corral break through. Steve lies still, face down.
FULL SHOT: The meadow, ANGLED PAST Clay. The horses scatter across the MED. SHOT Clay, now the hunter, moves toward Lednov's position. Lednov fires. Clay runs and jumps into the creek. Sheltered by the bank he makes his way up the creek.

MED. CLOSE: Lednov. He waits, his rifle ready. O.s. a twig snaps. Cautiously he looks ahead. There is silence.
MED. SHOT: his ANGLE. A light wind runs through the great trees. Shafts of light filter through the trees, making patterns on the forest floor. The light is dim, deceptive. Lednov, rifle ready, searches for some sign of Clay. Then from another direction comes the SOUND of movement. Lednov swings his rifle in that direction, waits. The SOUND has stopped.
CLAY'S VOICE: I'm here Lednov.
MED. CLOSE: Clay. Clay cautiously edges around the base of a tree. He picks up a stick, stops.
CLAY: Come on out.
LEDNOV'S VOICE: Come and get me.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Lednov crumples forward as his echoing voice fades out. Clay moves over to him to stand looking down.
DISSOLVE: EXT. MEADOW MED. SHOT. Steve sits propped up against the fence rail. His shirt is off and his shoulder is crudely bandaged. Clay, who has been putting the bandage on, stands and takes a sack of tobacco from his pocket.
CLAY: ( rolling cigarette ) How's that?
STEVE: Kind of sore.
CLAY: You'll live.
STEVE: ( shyly ) Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
CLAY: Yeah but don't make a habit of So maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
STEVE: So maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
CLAY: ( stares down at him, then ) I guess so but don't make a habit of it.
