THE REVENANT: Written by Mark L Smith
MICHAEL PUNKE: September 26, 2007
FITZGERALD: Likely got a splinter. Can't figure what to do without Mama here to pull it out for him. Boone chuckles. spits in Henry's direction.
BOONE: Need a doc, Captain? Henry looks up. sees Fitzgerald and Boone grinning at him. He slides his glove back on.
HENRY: Gather more wood. Fitzgerald waits for Henry to turn, then gives his back an exaggerated salute.
FITZGERALD: ( under his breath ) Shame my Pap was a broken down drunk. Else he could've bought me a Captain's job too. Boone snickers. Fitzgerald stomps his boot onto a branch, easily snaps it into two easy-to-carry pieces.
HENRY: Glass and the others will be back with some game, Fitzgerald. Just make sure you have the fires ready.
FITZGERALD: My supper's in the hands of a hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy. Hell, my belly feels full already. Fitzgerald's boot CRACKS another branch. and when it does, we hear the EXPLOSION OF A GUNSHOT.
BRIDGER: But bigger than we figured. Gonna be a load to haul back to camp.
PIG: Have to split it up I reckon.
GLASS: Yep. Bridger'll take the tail, and Pig you haul the rest. And Fitzgerald was right about Pig being a little slow, because he just nods. pulls out his knife to cut the tail off for Bridger. Bridger and Glass exchange a smile. until Glass notices something. steps over the elk, his eyes locked on the ground beside it. He runs a finger over the dirt. touches a broken twig.
BRIDGER: Another one close by? Glass doesn't answer. studies the track. feels the nearby brush. inhales the scent from his hand. Bridger and Pig watch him. exchange a confused glance. And then in a flash of movement, Glass is on his feet, racing away.
PIG: Glass just keeps running. Pig and Bridger chase after him.
BOONE: No rule says I'm the only one that's gotta gather this shit. The other men don't even notice. Then an ARROW WHIZZES THROUGH THE AIR from behind Boone. THWACK. it hits him in the back of the neck. erupts out the front of his throat. Boone stands frozen. confused. reaches up and grabs the bloody arrow. finally drops to his knees. And that's when a TRAPPER looks up. sees Boone on his knees, holding that arrow, his mouth open like a dying fish.
TRAPPER: WHOOSH. AN ARROW SAILS INTO THE TRAPPER'S CHEST, sending him flying backward. The camp explodes into chaos. men YELLING. grabbing for weapons. stumbling over each other as they duck behind trees.
`REE!: WHOOSH. AN ARROW SAILS INTO THE TRAPPER'S CHEST, sending him flying backward. The camp explodes into chaos. men YELLING. grabbing for weapons. stumbling over each other as they duck behind trees.
GLASS: GET TO THE BOAT! Fitzgerald takes off. flips his rifle around, swings it like a club across a warrior's head. WHACK!
TRAPPER: He aims his pistol over his shoulder as he runs. pulls the trigger. CLICK. pulls it again. CLICK. But he's too scared to stop his finger. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. THUD. as a hatchet buries in his back. He crashes face first into the shallows. The Arikara leader, ( ELK'S TONGUE ), animal bones braided into his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck, straddles the dying man. Elk's Tongue grabs the Trapper by the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY. Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar. start scrambling aboard, as arrows dart past them. drive into the wooden boat. Suddenly a WARRIOR EXPLODES FROM THE WATER. tackles Bridger as he climbs up the side of the flatboat. jerks him back into the river. Bridger flails in the water. watches the warrior raise his hatchet high to slam down. just as Glass SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS ANSTADT into the back of the Warrior's The Warrior collapses under the surface. Glass grabs Bridger's hand. drags him up onto the deck.
WAIT!: He aims his pistol over his shoulder as he runs. pulls the trigger. CLICK. pulls it again. CLICK. But he's too scared to stop his finger. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. THUD. as a hatchet buries in his back. He crashes face first into the shallows. The Arikara leader, ( ELK'S TONGUE ), animal bones braided into his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck, straddles the dying man. Elk's Tongue grabs the Trapper by the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY. Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar. start scrambling aboard, as arrows dart past them. drive into the wooden boat. Suddenly a WARRIOR EXPLODES FROM THE WATER. tackles Bridger as he climbs up the side of the flatboat. jerks him back into the river. Bridger flails in the water. watches the warrior raise his hatchet high to slam down. just as Glass SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS ANSTADT into the back of the Warrior's The Warrior collapses under the surface. Glass grabs Bridger's hand. drags him up onto the deck.
BRIDGER: Thank you. But Glass is already gone. FIRING BACK AT THE ARIKARA, as the current carries them away.
HEY!: Pig looks over the side. sees a frantic WILLIAM ANDERSON gripped to the edge. Pig pulls him onto the boat. Fitzgerald and Glass grab LONGPOLES. shove them against the river's bottom to pick up speed. Henry stands on deck, watching as Elk's Tongue yanks a DYING TRAPPER's head back by his hair to peel away his scalp. Henry drops his eyes. can't watch. The TRAPPER'S SCREAM
FITZGERALD: What's the plan, Captain? Henry's still lost in those screams.
ANDERSON: We're just floatin' farther from Fort Union. Henry's eyes instinctively look to Glass.
GLASS: The Missouri's no good. Not if the `Ree's running it.
FITZGERALD: So we just float the hell down to Mexico or wherever else this river takes us?
GLASS: We get ourselves safe outta range, then track another course up.
FITZGERALD: Add weeks to the trip.
BRIDGER: Better that than endin' up scalped on the side of the river.
FITZGERALD: ( shoving him away ) Shut up, kid, you don't get no say in this. Bridger starts to respond, but Fitzgerald's angry glare stops ( back to Henry ) And in case you hadn't noticed, Captain, we're twelve men short of what we were. ( off the badly wounded
TRAPPER ): Thirteen before long.
HENRY: I understand our situation, Mr. Fitzgerald. We do like Glass said. put some distance between us and the Arikara, then chart a course to Fort Union. Fitzgerald MUMBLES UNDER HIS BREATH. rolls those dark eyes to Anderson. Glass gives Henry a nod.
PIG: Reckon it's better `an lettin' the `Ree find him. take his ears. slice what's left all to shit. Glass nods. steps down off the boat to Henry and the others. They're gathered around a map spread out on the ground. Henry runs his finger along a THIN BLUE LINE.
HENRY: So we hike west to the Grand, then follow it up to Fort Union.
FITZGERALD: On foot? You got any idea how long that's gonna take? It'll be winter before we get there.
ANDERSON: Unless we come across a post. trade for some horses.
GLASS: No posts that far out.
FITZGERALD: So if we do this, we do every step with our own feet.
HENRY: We make camp here for the night, then load supplies and head out for the Grand at first light.
BRIDGER: Thank you. for what you done back You'd have done the same for me. Bridger nods. he hopes so.
GLASS: You'd have done the same for me. Bridger nods. he hopes so.
FITZGERALD: You treat that Anstadt sweeter than any woman, Glass.
STUBBY BILL: Never seen a woman that could stop a `Ree from three hundred feet.
ANDERSON: I knew a particular big-breasted redhead in Boston that might come The others manage a small laugh. Glass just keeps working on that rifle.
FITZGERALD: Bring it over here for me to have a Glass doesn't look up. wipes a rag down the barrel.
BRIDGER: ( MUMBLING )
FITZGERALD: What'd you say, kid? Bridger hesitates a beat. until the other men's eyes force a response.
BRIDGER: ( SOFTLY )
FITZGERALD: You're lucky you ain't a man yet. ( off the blade ) Else that mighta nicked somethin'. A few NERVOUS CHUCKLES from the others, hoping this is over. And it is, because Fitzgerald reaches over and pulls the knife away. cleans the dirty blade on Bridger's leg.
GLASS: Middle of workin' on it.
FITZGERALD: Well you can stop workin' on it, and let me have a look like I said. Fitzgerald gives another tug, but Glass' grip only grows tighter. His eyes roll up to Fitzgerald. make it clear he isn't giving up his rifle. And they hold that stare just as hard as they're holding Glass' rifle.
GLASS: Best I can tell, my place is right where I want it. on the smart end of my rifle. Fitzgerald realizes the barrel he's holding is aimed right at his stomach, while Glass' hand seems suddenly very close to the trigger. But Fitzgerald's pride and that whiskey won't let him lose this tug of war.
FITZGERALD: I'd be careful if I was you, boy. And this thing's about to turn real ugly. until.
HENRY: That's enough, Fitzgerald. Go sober up and get to sleep.
FITZGERALD: That's the trouble with this part of the world. No mirrors. Niggers forget what color they are. Glass ignores Fitzgerald. goes back to his rifle. Fitzgerald tosses the bottle at Anderson, then jerks his blanket up. walks off to sleep by himself. Glass glances up from his work. just long enough to give Bridger a nod.
HENRY: Can't sleep either?
GLASS: Never like closin' my eyes when I'm not sure who'll be standin' over me when I open `em.
HENRY: I keep thinking about Boone and the others. how maybe I should've had us make camp further up river.
GLASS: The tracks I saw. those `Ree had been tailin' us for a while. They'd have gone as far north as it took.
HENRY: Your years trappin' and guidin' out here. have you had much experience with the Arikara?
GLASS: Enough to try and stay outta their ( motions to Glass' map ) But you know this country well enough to get us past them. up to Fort Union?
HENRY: ( motions to Glass' map ) But you know this country well enough to get us past them. up to Fort Union?
GLASS: I been here a long while. Whether that gets us to Union or not. Henry waits for more. doesn't get it. So he just nods and starts back to his blanket.. stops.
HENRY: What Fitzgerald said earlier. he doesn't speak for the rest.
GLASS: He wasn't wrong. Truth is that's what I prefer about this country. it's got no eye for the color of a man's skin.
HENRY: ( BEAT )
STUBBY BILL: Shouldn't we have hit the Grand by We'll reach it soon enough. Glass said to keep this course.
HENRY: We'll reach it soon enough. Glass said to keep this course.
FITZGERALD: Glass said. Too bad I don't see That's on account he's up ahead makin' sure it's clear, and you get to keep your ears. Fitzgerald throws Pig an angry glance.
PIG: That's on account he's up ahead makin' sure it's clear, and you get to keep your ears. Fitzgerald throws Pig an angry glance.
FITZGERALD: Or he's run off and left us.
BRIDGER: He wouldn't do that. Fitzgerald GRUNTS. doesn't believe that.
FITZGERALD: My bet, that nigger's used to EXT. WOODS - DAY Glass moves slowly through the brush, almost gliding. subtle twists and turns to avoid branches and leaves. careful not to leave his scent behind. And his eyes cut through the trees as he moves. digging for any sign of He spots something at his feet. crouches down, running his finger over the SMALL ANIMAL TRACK in the dirt.
HENRY: UP AHEAD! Henry takes off at full sprint. The other men follow.
UP AHEAD!: Henry takes off at full sprint. The other men follow.
BRIDGER: Christ Almighty. Henry, Pig, and the others reach the edge.
HENRY: No answer. And all they can see is the bear, so they scan the trees.
PIG: Still nothing. So Bridger takes off down the slope. losing his balance but rolling back to his feet. He reaches the bear. sees GLASS' MANGLED ARM STICKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.
HUGH!: Still nothing. So Bridger takes off down the slope. losing his balance but rolling back to his feet. He reaches the bear. sees GLASS' MANGLED ARM STICKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.
BRIDGER: He's down here! Bridger uses all his strength to push the bear off, as the other men scramble down. But Bridger can't budge the massive carcass. not until Stubby Bill and Pig join in. shove the animal over, revealing the bloody mass that is Hugh Glass. .his throat is torn wide open. scalp peeled back from just above his eyebrows, hanging off the skull. stomach and chest a gruesome design of gashes and cuts. His right leg is snapped, the jagged bone jutting out through the skin. Bridger's legs give out. he drops to a knee and vomits.
MURPHY: Oh, Jesus.
STUBBY BILL: He's tore to pieces. The men stare down at Glass' corpse.
ANDERSON: Least he took that Grizz down with Wished he'da done it without firing his rifle. If there wasn't no `Ree around before, there will be now. And that's all Pig can stand. he TACKLES FITZGERALD. they roll to the ground. And in a flash Fitzgerald is on top, raining punches down on Pig. turning his face into a bloody Henry and Anderson grab Fitzgerald. drag him off.
FITZGERALD: Wished he'da done it without firing his rifle. If there wasn't no `Ree around before, there will be now. And that's all Pig can stand. he TACKLES FITZGERALD. they roll to the ground. And in a flash Fitzgerald is on top, raining punches down on Pig. turning his face into a bloody Henry and Anderson grab Fitzgerald. drag him off.
HENRY: THAT'S ENOUGH! Then somehow, GLASS GASPS. this horrible, GUTTURAL MOAN.
THAT'S ENOUGH!: Then somehow, GLASS GASPS. this horrible, GUTTURAL MOAN.
BRIDGER: Holy Christ, he's alive. Henry and Bridger fall to their knees beside Glass. Glass looks up at the men, tries to focus through the blood and pain. His breathing is just a GURGLING WHEEZE. bubbles forming along the deep gashes in his throat with each gasp.
HENRY: Get me some water. Stubby Bill tosses Henry his canteen. Henry empties it over Glass' throat. his face and scalp. The water hits the wounds and immediately transforms to blood.
BRIDGER: Oh, Jesus. Jesus. Glass lifts a trembling hand to his throat. feels the gaping wound. His eyes widen in horror. He COUGHS. the air splashes blood up from the open wounds in his throat.
HENRY: It's okay, Hugh. ( pushing Glass' hand away ) You're going to be fine. Henry spins his head away from Glass.
PIG: What about me, Cap?
HENRY: Get down here and help me tie off these wounds best we can. Pig shakily joins Henry in wrapping the wounds. The blood keeps seeping out, soaking the rags.
PIG: It won't stop bleedin'.
HENRY: Shut up, Pig.
BRIDGER: It's gonna be fine, Mr. Glass. Henry glances down to the PUDDLE OF BLOOD spilling out over his knees. oozing out from beneath Glass.
HENRY: Roll him over. easy. They gently push Glass onto one side, revealing DEEP, JAGGED, GASHES running across the width of Glass' back. Henry stares at the open flesh, ready to panic again. but he doesn't. Instead he looks to Pig.
BRIDGER: What about the rest of him?
HENRY: He's losing more blood back here. ( off the throat ) And I don't know what to do with that yet.
ANDERSON: They're torturin' the poor bastard.
FITZGERALD: And riskin' gettin' us killed in the process. Proper thing would be to end it for him quick.
ANDERSON: `Less he could pull through.
FITZGERALD: You seen what that grizz did to him. Shit, Glass'll be dead inside a hour. We all will be if he keeps screamin' like that.
BRIDGER: What now?
HENRY: We wait. Does he have any kin you know of?
PIG: He keeps to hisself. Never mentioned none.
HENRY: Go get the others. Tell `em we're making camp here for the night. Pig starts hustling away.
BRIDGER: It ain't for me. Bridger stands. walks over to the sleeping Glass. Pig's already crouched beside him. Bridger lifts Glass' small leather POSSIBLES BAG from beside the Anstadt rifle. drops the claw inside. throws a look back to Fitzgerald. Pig holds his palm out just above Glass' mouth.
PIG: I can feel some air outta his mouth. Maybe Captain sealed up his throat proper, huh? ( off Bridger's silence ) Whatta you figure his odds are, Bridger stares down at what's left of Glass.
BRIDGER: EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING The sun peeks over the horizon, sending an orange glow across the treetops.
MURPHY: What that bear did to him. I didn't expect he'd last this long.
ANDERSON: I seen a fella go a week once after a lion jumped him. Fever finally finished him off.
STUBBY BILL: Whatta we do, Cap? A long beat, then.
HENRY: We give him his chance. Henry turns and walks away.
FITZGERALD: You ain't doin' him or us no favors, Captain, lettin' him suffer that way. Henry's awake, but doesn't answer. He's holding his pistol in his hand, as he stares at Glass. thinking the same thing Fitzgerald just said. But he doesn't move. not yet. Fitzgerald angrily wraps a blanket around his head, muffling the sound. Bridger sits beyond him. smiles at Fitzgerald's misery, as he attaches the BEAR CLAW TO A THIN LEATHER STRAP. a necklace.
ANDERSON: Fever's hit. Won't be long now.
FITZGERALD: I seen a bad one drag on days.
FITZGERALD: ( TO HENRY )
BRIDGER: He's burnin', Cap. Water turns to boil as soon as it touches him. Henry considers this, then.
HENRY: Pig, take Anderson and scout ahead. Grand should be just west of here. Find us the best route.
FITZGERALD: Tryin' to buy Glass time don't make sense for the rest of us, Captain.
HENRY: ( TO PIG ) HENRY ( CONT'D ) ( WHISPERS )
FITZGERALD: Least it's a step in the right EXT. CAMP - LATER Fitzgerald is covered in dirt and sweat, standing knee deep in Glass' grave. Stubby Bill stands over him.
FITZGERALD: Any coyote digs that deep deserves the meal. He takes Stubby Bill's hand. pulls himself out.
PIG: Found it, Cap. Right where Glass had us headed.
ANDERSON: No more than a mile or so out. Henry looks to Bridger, still doctoring Glass.
HENRY: We could build a litter. Haul him with us.
ANDERSON: It's rocky and steep goin'. Henry looks to Pig for an honest answer.
PIG: Marshy and thick on the other side. We could try it, but. Pig shakes his head.
FITZGERALD: I signed on as a trapper, not a goddamn mule.
BRIDGER: ( TO HENRY )
HENRY: Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. But, Captain.
BRIDGER: But, Captain.
HENRY: Do it. Bridger hesitates, then reaches to fold the wet rag down over Glass' wide open eyes. And Glass must know what's happening, because his eyes roll up to Bridger's. his lips try to form a word. his hand digs its fingers into the dirt beside him.
BRIDGER: I'll stay with him. money or not.
PIG: Same here.
HENRY: I can't let you stay back, Pig. Without Glass, I'll need you to Henry looks to the others. they all drop their eyes. not Just need one more.
FITZGERALD: Two won't stand much chance against a party of `Ree, Captain, and seventy dollars won't buy me a new setta ears.
HENRY: A hundred then. Still nothing from the others.
BRIDGER: They can have my share too. I owe Glass that at least.
FITZGERALD: That case I'll hang back with the kid. I don't mind fallin' a day or so behind for two hundred.
HENRY: But Glass is to be cared for until. ( motions to Bridger ) I'll let the young doctor do his Henry hesitates. doesn't like this, but knows it's the best option left.
FITZGERALD: ( motions to Bridger ) I'll let the young doctor do his Henry hesitates. doesn't like this, but knows it's the best option left.
HENRY: The rest gather your gear. Bridger reaches down. lifts the rag from Glass' face. Their eyes meet. Bridger gives Glass a nod.
PIG: I'll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh. Glass's glazed eyes focus on Pig. He moves the only thing he can. BLINKS a "yes" back at him.
HENRY: ( to Fitzgerald and
BRIDGER ): As long as necessary.
BRIDGER: I'll look after him. Henry turns. leads the men into the trees. toward the Grand. toward Fort Union.
FITZGERALD: I'll take first watch.
BRIDGER: Not with his rifle.
FITZGERALD: Trust me, kid, he ain't gonna be needin' it tonight. Fitzgerald disappears into the trees.
FITZGERALD: You were right to protect this. Then he disappears. and we're left alone, staring up at the branches above us. the evening sky. accompanied by Glass' deathly breaths.
FITZGERALD: ( WHISPERS )
FITZGERALD: Don't you ever question me, you little piss-ant. Bridger tries to fight back, but Fitzgerald's too strong. holds him pressed against the tree. slams a heavy elbow into Bridger's mouth, splitting his lip.
BRIDGER: Keep quiet. I was down at the creek. there's twenty of `em at least, comin' this way.
FITZGERALD: Keep quiet. I was down at the creek. there's twenty of `em at least, comin' this way.
BRIDGER: Oh, shit. Whatta we do?
FITZGERALD: We run. Now. And Fitzgerald's just whispering, but it's with such power that Bridger has no response. watches as Fitzgerald gathers his bag, starts throwing in food and supplies. Bridger is scared out of his mind. does the same. grabs for his rifle, resting near Glass. Bridger freezes. in his panic, he'd forgotten all about Glass. And now the wounded man's eyes stare up at him. understanding perfectly what's happening around him.
BRIDGER: What about Glass?
FITZGERALD: He's on his own, same as us.
BRIDGER: I can't leave him.
FITZGERALD: Then I'm talkin' to a dead man. Glass gives Bridger the slightest of nods. go. But Bridger's frozen. doesn't know what to do. until Fitzgerald shoves him back to life.
BRIDGER: What're you doin'? He needs that.
FITZGERALD: He couldn't hold it if you tarred it to his hands. Glass strains to hold out his trembling hand for his gun.
BRIDGER: It's his goddamn rifle! That's all he's got!
FITZGERALD: And more than he'll need. Fitzgerald scoops up Glass' knife as well.
BRIDGER: We can't leave him with nothin'. But Fitzgerald is already sprinting away. disappearing into the trees. Glass stares after him, his once-calm eyes suddenly filled with a rage. And Bridger's frozen again, lost between duty and fear. until finally, he just shakes his head and takes off into the trees. Glass's empty hand falls back to the ground. he tries to yell out in anger, but his throat EXPLODES IN PAIN. His hand digs into the dirt. pulls him over onto his side. He flops over to his stomach. GASPS IN PAIN.
FITZGERALD: We ran the better part of six hours. Had to gain some ground on Henry and them others. Bridger sits at the base of a tree, not listening. staring. his mind replaying the desertion of Glass over and over. He notices the smoke.
BRIDGER: Best douse that smoke before them `Ree spot it.
FITZGERALD: We put enough distance between us and them. And it's too damn cold to go without one.
BRIDGER: All we know, they hoofed it through the night same as us.
FITZGERALD: ( shakes his head ) A dozen `Ree can't make the time us two did. Bridger looks back to the trees. then considers something, stares at Fitzgerald a beat, before.
BRIDGER: It was twenty earlier.
FITZGERALD: When you woke me. you said you'd spotted twenty `Ree.
BRIDGER: When you woke me. you said you'd spotted twenty `Ree.
FITZGERALD: A dozen. twenty. I wasn't in a mood to count feathers. Hell, one `Ree woulda been too many. Fitzgerald empties his canteen over the fire, killing the flames. Bridger stares at the water pouring out.
BRIDGER: What was you even doin' down at the creak in the middle of the night?
FITZGERALD: Don't start questionin' me on accounta you feelin' guilty `bout leavin' your nigger buddy behind. Bridger musters up all the courage he can. aims his rifle at Fitzgerald.
BRIDGER: ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD Fitzgerald stares back at Bridger and his rifle. eyes taking in everything. a snake sizing up its prey. Then Fitzgerald stands. takes a step toward the boy.
OFF!: Fitzgerald stares back at Bridger and his rifle. eyes taking in everything. a snake sizing up its prey. Then Fitzgerald stands. takes a step toward the boy.
FITZGERALD: What're you askin'? Why it was you turned your back on Glass? Why you let him die to save your own sorry `Cause you was scared shitless, that's why.
BRIDGER: The `Ree. did you see `em? ( off Fitzgerald's silence )
FITZGERALD: ( MOVING CLOSER )
BRIDGER: I'm goin' back for him.
FITZGERALD: Far as we ran all night, you couldn't find Glass with dogs and a map. And I don't believe you really want to. `Cause after leavin' him to die the first time, I doubt he'd be too happy to see you now. Fitzgerald digs at the dirt with the knife. covers the fire's remains.
SPOTTED HORSE: Glass hears the familiar word. nods. Three Feathers pulls a WHITE SPECK from the back of Glass' neck. holds it up to Spotted Horse. Spotted Horse jerks out his knife. Glass is confused. holds up his hand, as he takes a step back. But Three Feathers and Running Fox grab Glass. secure him. pull his jacket down off his shoulders, exposing his shirt, as Spotted Horse walks around behind Glass. raises the knife. Glass GROWLS A PLEA. but Spotted Horse slices the knife down Glass' back. just cutting open his shirt. and revealing a
FITZGERALD: `Bout goddamn time. They start down the slope. Fitzgerald grabs Bridger's arm. And we're understood on everything. Glass' dyin' in his sleep. us buryin' him like was Bridger doesn't respond. Fitzgerald doesn't like that.
FITZGERALD: Twice the folks here than when we We should go see Captain Henry.
BRIDGER: We should go see Captain Henry.
FITZGERALD: Far as we hiked. we got time for a drink on the company's tab.
FITZGERALD: If your fat ass could get through, we didn't have no worries. Pig glares at Fitzgerald. watches him walk to the table, joining the others.
PIG: ( off Fitzgerald, to
BRIDGER ): Had to be a helluva long walk for Bridger nods. Pig has no idea.
BRIDGER: I hope not. A PROSTITUTE walks down the stairs. stops on the landing, waiting for her next customer. Fitzgerald spots her. Maybe we best go see Henry, kid. I just got a itch to spend the first of my two-hundred. The other men laugh. Not Bridger.
FITZGERALD: ( TO BRIDGER )
FITZGERALD: I won't pretend to been his friend, but I respect any man that fights the way he done.
HENRY: And the grave?
FITZGERALD: We had those extra days so we went deeper. covered it in rocks. To keep the scavengers off him.
HENRY: Any sign of hostiles?
FITZGERALD: Not a one. The words are like a punch in the gut to Bridger. He can't take the pain. opens his mouth to speak, but Fitzgerald beats him to it.
HENRY: Glad to hear you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger. I knew you More than his share, Captain.
FITZGERALD: More than his share, Captain.
HENRY: Speaking of shares. Henry turns to a SAFE resting against the wall. Fitzgerald watches as Henry spins the dial. locks in the combination, then pulls the latch. The safe door swings open. .revealing STACKS OF CASH. Fitzgerald's eyes lock on all that money. Henry pulls out a handful. starts counting them out onto the desk.
FITZGERALD: Fortunate for me, it did not.
HENRY: Well thank you both for your courage and honor. You have done yourselves proud. Fitzgerald swipes up his pile of bills. Henry drops a couple bills in front of Bridger.
FITZGERALD: He's beat hisself up most of the trip. wishin' he'da done more.
HENRY: We all saw the shape Glass was in. There was no more to be done.
FITZGERALD: That's what I been tellin' him.
GLASS: ( scratching and rough ) Thank you. Waki doesn't understand. just raises a cup of liquid. says something, then touches his throat. motions for him to drink. Glass sips the drink. grimaces. shakes his head, trying to give the cup back, but Waki refuses. points at his throat, and motions for him to drink. Glass stares in the cup a beat, then gulps it back. shakes his head.
GLASS: How many suns? Ten? Waki studies Glass. the sun. begins to understand. She nods. SAYS A WORD. holds up all ten of her fingers.
BOYS: Tatanka Wicasa. .over and over. Glass stares back, unsure. Then.
GLASS: You speak English.
SPOTTED HORSE: Need words when trade with whites.
GLASS: Well I'm grateful for you bringing me here. havin' them care for me. ( off Spotted Horse's nod ) Now if you could point me which way it is you do your tradin'. with the whites.
SPOTTED HORSE: ( POINTS )
GLASS: Fort Brazeau? That's where I'm tryin' to get. Is it far from here? Spotted Horse doesn't understand. Glass motions into the Far? Long way? Spotted Horse points to a horse, then holds up three fingers.
SPOTTED HORSE: Not walk. Hides soon. Glass doesn't understand. until Spotted Horse points to a ROW OF BUFFALO HIDES hanging from a line. Spotted Horse ( cont'd ) We trade Bra-zo. Glass stares at the tanning hides, then down at his leg. Finally, he nods. Spotted Horse starts walking. waves for Glass to follow. Spotted Horse ( cont'd ) Come. Eat. Glass follows after him. The children sneak in behind, giggling as they tail Glass across camp. Glass glances back. New Moon and Little One duck behind a tee-pee. wait for him to continue before they scoot back out after him.
GLASS: The men stole my rifle. The Sioux don't understand. Glass reaches over, taking Spotted Horse's plate.
SPOTTED HORSE: Red Hawk ask who kill griz-lee. Glass touches his chest. Red Hawk nods, impressed. Glass points to the JAGGED SCARS running up Red Hawk's neck to a
GLASS: Red Hawk smiles. shakes his head.
RED HAWK: That word, Glass understands. Red Hawk rambles a long sentence in Sioux. The other members LAUGH.
SPOTTED HORSE: He say Arikara take right ear of Sioux. Left ear of whites. Not know what they take from you. Glass smiles along with the others. They continue their meal.
SPOTTED HORSE: Buff-A-lo Man hunt with Sioux? Glass relaxes. nods. takes the spear from Spotted Horse. Three Feathers hands a BUFFALO HIDE to Glass. motions for Glass to put it on.
THREE FEATHERS: Tatanka Wicasa. Glass wraps the hide around him. The Warriors smile and nod.
BOYS: Tatanka Wicasa! Tatanka Wicasa! Spotted Horse stands across the village, watching Glass and the boys play in the snow.
GLASS: Thank you.
SPOTTED HORSE: Good hunt.
GLASS: Glass smiles up at Spotted Horse's son.
SPOTTED HORSE: You. Fam-i-lee?
GLASS: ( shakes his head ) No wom-an? ( pointing to son ) A long beat, then.
SPOTTED HORSE: No wom-an? ( pointing to son ) A long beat, then.
GLASS: No. Not for a long time. Glass continues eating. watches Spotted Horse bounce the giggling little boy on his shoulders.
GLASS: ( taps his chest ) Tatanka Wicasa.
GLASS: SPOTTED HORSE ( NODS )
SPOTTED HORSE: ( NODS )
FITZGERALD: No. please. But Glass swings the blade.
SPOTTED HORSE: We go. Glass calms. nods.
BRAZEAU: ( thick French accent ) Bon jour, Spotted Horse. You come with many hides I hope. ( off Spotted Horse's nod ) We make good trades then. Brazeau's eyes lock on Glass. stares at him, unsure.
GLASS: Good to see you again, Mr. Brazeau.
BRAZEAU: Jesus Christ, what happened to your goddamned face?
GLASS: Had a tussle with a grizzly. Glass shakes Brazeau's hand. Brazeau studies his face. notices the Bear Claw Necklace. smiles.
BRAZEAU: And now the grizzly, he don't look so good either, eh? Glass shakes his head.
GLASS: They looked after me for a spell. I'm on my way to catch back up with Captain Henry. at Fort Union. Needed to trade for some supplies on the Company's credit if I could.
BRAZEAU: Oui, of course. Anything you like. Glass pulls down a KENTUCKY LONG RIFLE.
GLASS: We can start with this.
BRAZEAU: You can pick up the horse at the livery in the morning. ( off Glass' nod ) I wish I could give you a room for the night, but. Brazeau looks to SEVERAL TRAPPERS standing across the room, glaring at Glass.
GLASS: Won't be the last night I sleep on the ground. Glass nods to Brazeau, then walks out.
BRAZEAU: Take care of that face, Glass.
GLASS: ( points to the tents ) You stay here tonight? Spotted Horse shakes his head. motions back toward the wilderness. Then he points to the trading post. the
SPOTTED HORSE: Your people? Glass looks back to all the white faces. trappers, drunks, prostitutes. He shakes his head.
GLASS: SPOTTED HORSE
SPOTTED HORSE: You come then. Spotted Horse taps his own chest. points back the way they came. Glass hesitates, almost like he's considering it. then he shakes his head again. points the opposite way.
GLASS: Fort Union. Spotted Horse stares at Glass a long beat, then.
SPOTTED HORSE: You spend your life hunting enemy. Enemy wins.
GLASS: It will be over soon. Then Glass pulls the Bear Claw Necklace off. hands it to Spotted Horse. Spotted Horse holds it. then proudly slides it over his head.
FITZGERALD: I had enough of this cold as hell What'd you figure when ya signed on outta that St. Louis whorehouse you was workin'? That you was headin' off to paradise? Pig snorts a laugh at Fitzgerald's expense.
ANDERSON: What'd you figure when ya signed on outta that St. Louis whorehouse you was workin'? That you was headin' off to paradise? Pig snorts a laugh at Fitzgerald's expense.
FITZGERALD: I tell ya what I figured, I figured I'd be somewhere the piss wouldn't freeze before I got it outta my Figured wrong.
BRIDGER: Figured wrong.
FITZGERALD: Waste a time to check traps in this weather. while Henry sits warmin' his ass on the stove in his office.
STUBBY BILL: Why don't you go tell him that, Fitz? Then start your hike back to St. Louie.
FITZGERALD: Shit, I walked up here, I got no problem walkin' back.
MURPHY: Contracted for twelve months. We all did.
FITZGERALD: Henry can shove that contract up his toasty warm ass, or I'll do it for him. The others laugh at Fitzgerald's rambling.
ANDERSON: Just give that fat little whore you're so sweet on a couple extra bits. she'll have you thinkin' it's Spring already. The men laugh as Fitzgerald walks out. leaves the door wide open for the cold wind to pour over the others. Pig scurries over, shoving it closed. As the other men gather around a table to play cards, Bridger pulls a JOURNAL from under his cot. falls onto the cot, and starts writing.
FITZGERALD: Hello? Captain? The place is empty. Fitzgerald eyes Henry's desk. then past his desk. to the SAFE. its door CRACKED OPEN. STACKS OF MONEY visible inside. Fitzgerald glances around. looks back to that safe.
FITZGERALD: To the river, Murphy. Murphy squints down into the shadows.
MURPHY: That you, Fitzgerald?
FITZGERALD: Left my rifle down there. don't want it out all night.
MURPHY: That weren't too smart.
FITZGERALD: Just don't take a shot at me when I come back in.
MURPHY: We'll see.
FITZGERALD: Not that you'd hit me if you tried. Murphy fakes a laugh. raises his rifle down at Fitzgerald.
GLASS: ( struggling to make his frozen lips move ) I'm Hugh Glass of.
RUNTY MAN: We don't serve niggers. Glass stares at the Runty Man a beat, then.
GLASS: Of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company on my way to Fort Union.
RUNTY MAN: I don't care if you was with Lewis and Clark headed for the new world. We don't serve niggers.
GLASS: All I need is a horse and enough supplies to.
TRAPPER: Ice musta froze up his ears, `cause he ain't listenin' to you, Cees.
GLASS: .to get me to Fort Union. I can sign a draft made good by Captain The Runty Man just stares at Glass. grins a TOOTHLESS GRIN.
RUNTY MAN: What the fuck happened to your face, boy? You try to slice all the black off?
TRAPPER #2: Maybe we oughta help him do it Best get on your way, boy. Glass stares back at the men for a long beat, then.
FAT TRAPPER: Best get on your way, boy. Glass stares back at the men for a long beat, then.
GLASS: I'm Hugh Glass of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, and all I need is.
RUNTY MAN: ( to the trappers ) Do you believe this shit? Trapper #1 and Trapper #2 pull the SKINNING KNIVES from their belts. start toward Glass.
FAT TRAPPER: Hell, I warned ya.
GLASS: All I need. And that's when Trapper #1 grabs for Glass, but in a flash of movement that catches them all off-guard, Glass has is own knife pulled and JAMMED UNDER TRAPPER #1's CHIN. Everyone freezes.
RUNTY MAN: Shoot him, goddammit!
TRAPPER #2: I can't get a clear look.
RUNTY MAN: Shoot `em both! The Runty Man snatches one of the rifles. BOOM. fires a wild shot past the riders.
RUNTY MAN: Get after the son of a bitch! The trappers exchange glances. don't move.
TRAPPER #2: It's cold as hell, Cees.
FAT TRAPPER: And he did say to put it all on the Rocky Mountain tab. The Runty Man glares at the trappers.
STUBBY BILL: Jesus Christ.
BRIDGER: I'm sorry. Glass raises the stolen pistol. aims it at Bridger. And the young man doesn't flinch. almost as if he wants to make sure Glass doesn't miss.
GLASS: You took everything I had. left me to die. Glass walks toward Bridger, the gun still raised. each step of his feet on the wood floor is like the thud of an executioner's drum. MUMBLING from the other men, as they watch this ghost reach Bridger. stand over him, the pistol aimed down.
BRIDGER: I was scared of dyin'.
GLASS: There wasn't no `Ree that night, was there? A long beat, then.
BRIDGER: Glass PISTOL WHIPS BRIDGER, knocking him to the floor. And before Bridger can crawl away, Glass in over him. those aching, frozen fists beating mercilessly down on Bridger. And Bridger doesn't fight back. just does his best to cover up, but the blows keep coming, and Bridger's face is covered in blood. .just as Henry runs inside, half-dressed from where Stubby Bill awoke him. Henry grabs Glass. pulls him off. Glass spins. jams his pistol right in Henry's face.
HENRY: Hugh. Wait. Glass is crazy with rage. barely stops himself from pulling that trigger. But finally, he calms. his arm sinks, lowering his aim. He glances around the bunkhouse.
GLASS: Where's Fitzgerald and my rifle?
HENRY: Deserted two days ago. Along with about five hundred dollars of company money.
BRIDGER ): I wanna hear what happened. Glass looks back to Bridger. they hold a long stare, until Glass walks out.
BRIDGER: Wait. Please! But Glass and Henry disappear, leaving Bridger alone with all those eyes burning into him. Bridger looks to Pig, but Pig just lowers his eyes. can't even look at the boy. The men step into their boots and furs. file out after Glass and Henry. leaving Bridger alone in the bunkhouse.
GLASS: I cut the shoes loose of her, and hiked over to Fort Talbot.
STUBBY BILL: Christ almighty.
GLASS: And you may hear from the fella there about a stoled horse and supplies charged to you.
HENRY: We'll take care of it. You should go settle in.
MURPHY: There's a couple fair whores next door that'll ease the miles on ya, scars or not. Stubby Bill gives Murphy an elbow.
ANDERSON: Jesus, Murph.
MURPHY: I just meant I'd go roust one of `em for ya if you wanted.
GLASS: She can take the night off, but I wouldn't mind the use of her bed.
HENRY: ( TO MURPHY )
PIG: I told ya I'd see ya up here. You remember that, Hugh?
GLASS: I do, Pig. You must have a little gypsy in ya. Pig grins and nods.
PIG: I'll see ya in the mornin'. Pig exits, leaving just Glass and Henry, sitting in a beat of silence, until.
HENRY: Can I talk you outta what you're Glass doesn't answer. just stands, placing the coffee cup on the table.
GLASS: Thank you for what you done for me. stitchin' me back together. givin' me a chance.
HENRY: I'm offerin' you another right now. to stay here. let this thing go.
GLASS: ( BEAT )
HENRY: The law will make Fitzgerald pay. Glass stares out the window. his SCARRED REFLECTION stares back at him.
GLASS: You told me once that other men didn't think like him.
MURPHY: He said he was goin' to get his And then Murphy catches himself. shrugs.
PIG: And the Captain found the money I'll make my way down river. See what turns up. Glass pulls the cinch tight around the horse. Stubby Bill comes waddling toward them.
GLASS: I'll make my way down river. See what turns up. Glass pulls the cinch tight around the horse. Stubby Bill comes waddling toward them.
STUBBY BILL: The kid's gone. gear and all. Musta slipped out before light. Stubby Bill waves Bridger's journal at them. STUBBY BILL ( cont'd ) Just left this on his bunk. Henry takes the journal. flips it open.
HENRY: ( READING )
GLASS: If I run across the boy, I'll send him back your way. Glass sees Henry on horseback, trotting toward them.
HENRY: Fitzgerald stole five hundred dollars. Rocky Mountain Fur Company wants him too.
GLASS: I can do this on my own.
HENRY: I know you can. But maybe you won't have to. Glass stares at Henry a beat, then finally just pulls his horse around. heads for the river. Henry nods to Pig and Murphy as he follows after Glass.
RUNTY MAN: We ain't got no food to spare, friend, if that's what you're lookin' for. The figure pulls back his furs, and we see it's Fitzgerald. cold and miserable.
FITZGERALD: Then what the hell have ya got?
RUNTY MAN: Whiskey and blankets mostly. Weather's held back deliveries. Fitzgerald throws a glance to the Trappers.
FITZGERALD: Gimme a couple bottles then. Goddamn ice shredded my boat. Been walkin' for two days. The Runty Man hands Fitzgerald the bottles. Fitzgerald pops one. gulps some down.
RUNTY MAN: Horses ain't cheap this time a Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain Fur Company's good for it. And those words stop everything. The Trappers all turn from their game. The Runty Man glares at Fitzgerald.
FITZGERALD: Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain Fur Company's good for it. And those words stop everything. The Trappers all turn from their game. The Runty Man glares at Fitzgerald.
RUNTY MAN: You're the second son of a bitch come in here makin' that claim. And the first one left a bad taste.
FITZGERALD: That right? Well I don't know nothin' about that. Just that I need a horse.
RUNTY MAN: So did this other fella. So he stole one. along with Lange's Trapper #1 nods to Fitzgerald.
FITZGERALD: Fine then, I'll pay cash for the horse. How much?
RUNTY MAN: How `bout you pay for your friend's And my shooter.
TRAPPER #1: And my shooter.
FITZGERALD: Wasn't my friend. Trapper #1 stands up.
TRAPPER #1: Then from where I stand, you don't got no friends at all. The other Trappers glare at Fitzgerald. The Runty Man just grins that toothless smile of his. Fitzgerald's in a bind, and he knows it.
FITZGERALD: Yeah, okay. I'll collect from him. How much?
RUNTY MAN: How `bout we say eighty. ( sees Fitzgerald doesn't
ARGUE ): Fitzgerald starts digging into his pocket.
FITZGERALD: You boys are leavin' me with nothin'. Better be a helluva Pick of the litter. The Runty Man snatches the cash. RUNTY MAN ( cont'd ) And when you see that scarred-up nigger, you tell him he'd best not show up here again. Fitzgerald freezes. not sure he heard correctly.
RUNTY MAN: Pick of the litter. The Runty Man snatches the cash. RUNTY MAN ( cont'd ) And when you see that scarred-up nigger, you tell him he'd best not show up here again. Fitzgerald freezes. not sure he heard correctly.
FITZGERALD: When I see who?
RUNTY MAN: The black son of a bitch that robbed me. You tell him that. A long beat, then.
FITZGERALD: Scarred up, you say. and headed up to Union?
RUNTY MAN: That's what he told us. Seemed real anxious to get there too.
FITZGERALD: ( NODS )
HENRY: Henry points. Glass follows his finger along the river. to a CANOE resting on the bank ahead. They dismount. examine the canoe. the letters "RMFC" painted on the side.
GLASS: Ice tore it up.
HENRY: What's out that direction? Talbot?
GLASS: And the Missouri. Doubt he'd risk the river with the `Ree. Likely grab a horse, and cross over high. take his chances goin' east against the weather. When'd you say he skipped out?
HENRY: Three days ago now.
GLASS: We best pick up our pace. They climb back onto their horses. trot into the trees.
HENRY: This was Fitzgerald camped here?
GLASS: Couple nights back. But these tracks aren't all his.
HENRY: He's travelin' with somebody?
GLASS: ( shakes his head ) Came in after. Prints are smooth. Henry throws Glass a look. he knows what that means.
HENRY: But you figure they're `Ree.
GLASS: I don't figure nothin', Captain. But whoever it is, they're a good day behind Fitzgerald. Glass walks, leading his horse, as he follows the tracks away from camp. Henry rides after him.
HENRY: You told me once you knew enough to keep away from the `Ree.
GLASS: I do.
HENRY: You figure this is smart then? Glass swings up onto his horse.
GLASS: You're welcome to head back, Glass trots off. Henry watches him a beat, then throws a glance into the trees. follows after Glass.
HENRY: What if we find Fitzgerald. and I ask you not to do this? Glass spreads a blanket over the ground.
GLASS: Don't ask me. Glass settles in on the warm earth. Henry just keeps watching him.
HENRY: ( WHISPERS )
GLASS: But it's too late. Henry fires. BOOM. the shot explodes through the night. .and the DEER leaps away. Henry looks to Glass. shakes his head. sorry.
HENRY: So much for stayin' quiet.
HENRY: Guess you would've been better off on your own.
GLASS: We needed to pick up some time The two riders disappear into the dark trees.
HENRY: Whatta ya got?
GLASS: Glass pulls some snow from his horse's mane. tosses it in the air, and watches it blow to the side. Glass turns his horse toward the breeze. squints out into the night.
HENRY: What if it's `Ree?
GLASS: Then we leave `em be. meet back up here.
FITZGERALD: Didn't figure an important man like you to be away from your stove on a night as cold as this, Captain. You lost? Henry just stares back at Fitzgerald and that rifle. His eyes drift to his own rifle, still strapped onto his saddle.
HENRY: I'm here to save your life.
FITZGERALD: I done told you boys. I don't need savin' by you or nobody else. Henry knows he's only got one chance. he makes a grab for the rifle.
GLASS: You shouldn't a come. As Glass looks at Henry, he notices something. takes Henry by the chin, and tilts his head. And HENRY'S RIGHT EAR HAS
FITZGERALD: ( through the water and
ICE ): Help me! ( off Glass' stare ) Glass. please! Glass hesitates a beat, staring at him, just as he did with Bridger that night in the bunkhouse. And then Glass leans down. grabs the Anstadt to pull Fitzgerald up. Except Glass SLICES THE BLADE ACROSS THE STRAP OF THE ANSTADT, sending Fitzgerald floating away under the ice, as Glass holds on to the Anstadt.
GLASS: I am Tatanka Wicasa! I have killed whites and I have killed Arikara and I have killed grizzly! AND I
COME ON!: But the Arikara don't attack. don't move at all. until Elk's Tongue gives Glass the SLIGHTEST OF NODS, then turns. they disappear back into the trees. Glass watches them fade away, then collapses to his knees on the icy river. exhausted in every possible way. He begins to cry.
