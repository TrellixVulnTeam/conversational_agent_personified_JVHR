PLATO: Yes. My best friend.
JUDY: What's he like?
PLATO: Oh, I don't know. You have to get to know him. He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it. He's sincere.
JUDY: Well, that's the main thingdon't you think so?
PLATO: Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with himand fishing. I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof. His name's Jim. It's really James but he likes Jim more. People he really likeshe lets call him "Jamie."

PLATO: Go on! Move!
JUDY: ( hardly audible ) This is fine
JIM: ( calling quietly ) Judy. Will you be okay?
JIM: I got to go in. You better get home too. Why don't you come home with me? I mean nobody's home at my houseand I'm not tired, are you? I don't have manypeople I can talk to.
PLATO: Why don't you come home with me? I mean nobody's home at my houseand I'm not tired, are you? I don't have manypeople I can talk to.

JIM: ( interrupting ) Hey.you flippedor something? You better take off.
PLATO: ( suddenly, pleasantly ) O.K. G'night. I got to pick up my scooter. See you tomorrow.
JIM: PLATO turns, walks up the alley to the street. JIM goes into his kitchen door. Hallway. JUDY's house. Three doors open onto it: one is closedthis is JUDY's room:another, leading into BEAU's room is open, but the room beyond is dark: the third, also open, reveals the bedroom of JUDY's parents. As JUDY comes into the hallway, the parents, who are reading in their beds, look up. JUDY hesitates, then starts toward her own JUDY stops. BEAU appears at his door in white pajamas, a small ghost. JUDY looks at him.
BEAU: Hello, darling, baby-pie, glamor- puss, sweetie
JUDY'S FATHER: ( calling from his bed ) Beau! You belong in bed!
MOTHER: He's home! You're home! You're all right!
MOTHER: What happened, darling. We were so worried. I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
JIM: I have to talk to someone, Mom. I have to talk to you both. And Dad this time you got to give me an Go ahead.
FATHER: Go ahead.
JIM: I'm in terrible trouble.You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
FATHER: Surethere was a bad accident there. They showed the pictures on
JIM: I was in it.
MOTHER: It doesn't matter how. I was driving a stolen car
JIM: It doesn't matter how. I was driving a stolen car
MOTHER: Do you enjoy doing this to me or MomI'm not
JIM: MomI'm not
MOTHER: And you wanted him to make a list!
FATHER: Will you let him tell it!
JIM: She never wants to hear. She doesn't care!
MOTHER: I guess when I nearly died giving birth to youthat shows how much I don't care!
FATHER: Just relax, please relax!
JIM: I told you Dad, it was a question of honor. They called me chicken you know, chicken! I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again. So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other. We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff. I got out okay but Buzz didn't. He was killed.
MOTHER: Good Lord!
JIM: I can't keep it to myself anymore
FATHER: Well, just get it off your chest, son.
JIM: That's not what I mean. I've never done anything right. I've been going around with my head in a sling for years.I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it. I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
FATHER: You're absolutely right!
JIM: Are you listening to me? You're involved in this! I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
FATHER: You what?
MOTHER: Did anyone see you there? I mean did they get your license number or I don't think so
FATHER: Did anyone see you there? I mean did they get your license number or I don't think so
JIM: I don't think so
FATHER: What about the other boysDo you think they'll go to the police?
MOTHER: What about the other boysDo you think they'll go to the police?
JIM: What's that got to do with it?
MOTHER: Why should you be the only one.
FATHER: Look Jim. Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's
MOTHER: Are you going to preach now? Are we going to have a sermon?
FATHER: I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life! Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
MOTHER: That's right!
JIM: Except yourself!
FATHER: Will you wait a minute?
JIM: You don't want me to go.
MOTHER: No! I don't want you to go to the police! There were other people and why should you be the only one But I am involved! We're all involved, Mom! A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
JIM: But I am involved! We're all involved, Mom! A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
FATHER: You know you did wrong. That's the main thing, isn't it?
JIM: No! It's nothing! Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth. You think you can just turn that off?
MOTHER: He's not saying that! He's saying don't volunteer!
JIM: Just tell a little white lie?
FATHER: You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
JIM: I don't want to learn that!
MOTHER: Well, it doesn't matter anyhow because we're moving.
JIM: No! You're not tearing me loose any more.
MOTHER: Do I have to spell it out?
JIM: You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom. Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse. Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away. Sonthis is all happening so fast
FATHER: Sonthis is all happening so fast
JIM: You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something Jimmy, you're very youngand a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
