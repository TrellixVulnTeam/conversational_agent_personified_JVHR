RUDY: The Alamo pulls the blade out with a ferocious YELL, pushes Nick to the floor and spins on Rudy! Rudy blocks with a chair, stumbling back, cartwheeling over a table as The Alamo roars over him for the kill and two GUARDS tackle the big Indian out of nowhere! Knocking the knife away, hammering him with blackjacks. It takes another three guards to keep The Alamo down. Rudy scrambles across the floor. Nick's on his back, blood pumping freely from his gut

ASHLEY: Rudy nods. Silence again.
RUDY: Gotta be ten degrees out there.
ASHLEY: Radio said negative five.
RUDY: Negative five?
ASHLEY: I don't think it's negative five.
RUDY: I don't think it's negative five.
ASHLEY: Radio said. Wind chill. That's probably what they meant.
RUDY: Wind chill. That's probably what they meant.
RUDY: I was scared. Scared you were gonna take one look at me and change your mind. Scared I was walking into heartache. All those words. you put a picture in your mind of where they come from and when you see where maybe it's not the same as your
ASHLEY: I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other No, no
RUDY: No, no
ASHLEY: Saw my outfit or something, my coat
RUDY: No, hey, I like your coat
ASHLEY: Saw me
RUDY: Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious. I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
ASHLEY: You are to me.

That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn. A guy like you, Nick six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
RUDY: Had some bad relationships, didn't Not bad. Just regular. You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
ASHLEY: Not bad. Just regular. You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.

GABRIEL: "My sweet, sexy Ashy-lashy, I have been dreaming of you constantly, and knowing you are out there makes these walls not seem so close or so strong or so cold." Women live for this stuff. Dreaming 'bout your this, dreaming 'bout your those, gettin' X-rated on me here, Nicky. where are we. oh, right, other side. "Someday I'm gonna take you up by Lake S. Before I went in, before goddamn Millie, 'fore I had my situation, I used to work up at this casino, working security. Used to watch for people stealing chips, counting cards, getting piss-drunk, that kinda shit. Indian place, they hired this reject outta Vegas to run it, got about as much business sense as a buffalo patty. Anyways, it's a fun place to run some numbers and
GABRIEL: You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
RUDY: I never worked at no casino.
ASHLEY: ( hopeless )
RUDY: That's the guy I was in with, I did my last ten months with him. He rode a two-year bit for manslaughter split a guy's skull open at a bar for harassing his girl. That's Nick Mason. He worked at that casino. He's the one who wrote her letters. Me, I'm a damn mechanic, my last job was a Quickie Lube, I did five for lifting cars. I don't know shit about blackjack, I don't know shit about Indians. I'm not him.

GABRIEL: He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend Bury him all over the place.
ASHLEY: She charges at her brother. Gabriel grabs her, spins her into control and PUNCHES her in the jaw. She goes flying out of the truck. HITS the ground hard. In shock. Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy across the lot. A stand of dark and snowy woods ahead.
NO!: She charges at her brother. Gabriel grabs her, spins her into control and PUNCHES her in the jaw. She goes flying out of the truck. HITS the ground hard. In shock. Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy across the lot. A stand of dark and snowy woods ahead.
MERLIN: Beats prison, I guess.
JUMPY: The problem with prison. is that it is founded on the fundamentally flawed perception of rehabilitation through punishment. A society can't hope to create a "changed man" by surrounding him with the worst in his fellow man; what it "rehabilitates" is solely a conviction that if he can survive the inhumanity of prison, what then, can he not withstand? He has seen man's darkest soul and kept his sight: what is left for such a man? What faith? What fear?
JUMPY: Don't get no blood on my boots
RUDY: WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW!
RUDY: About the Tomahawk! What the hell do you want to know!
RUDY: I spend six months writing poetry and my goddamn pen pal fucks me over. Thanks for the stamps, Ash. You want me, you got me. Whaddya want to know.
GABRIEL: Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy back. Still on the ground:
ASHLEY: I love you. Nick, I love you.
GABRIEL: Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
RUDY: She says a lot of things.
GABRIEL: She's getting you to help us. 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her Wish I had a brother like you.
RUDY: Wish I had a brother like you.
GABRIEL: A girl says she loves you, you say
RUDY: I had better sex in prison.
GABRIEL: Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here. Get him back in the rig.
PUG: Whole time you were driving, he was telling her he's not the guy, he's not the guy. I know why he'd tell us he's not the guy. why's he telling her he's not the guy? What if he's not the guy?
GABRIEL: The man who wrote those letters loved Ashley, boys. He lived for her love. Let's see him live for love.
GABRIEL: Where's she work?
RUDY: ( forces gun harder ) Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
GABRIEL: ( forces gun harder ) Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?

RUDY: ( thinking hard ) What'd they call her in high school?
GABRIEL: What'd they call her in high school?
RUDY: Bam Bam.
GABRIEL: What'd they call her in college?
RUDY: What college.
GABRIEL: Where'd she drop her cherry?
ASHLEY: Be more specific.
RUDY: Be more specific.
GABRIEL: Be more specific.
RUDY: A station wagon in Canada.
GABRIEL: What's her greatest fear?
RUDY: Her brother.
GABRIEL: Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
RUDY: No. It's her brother.
GABRIEL: That's love.
GABRIEL: Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales
RUDY: Nick don't talk till Nick gets
RUDY: Hot. Chocolate.
MERLIN: You want that for here or to go?
RUDY: I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
RUDY: And some pecan-fucking-pie.
GABRIEL: So when you worked there
GABRIEL: You knew the place
RUDY: Rudy stares hard. Gobbles the crumbs, washes it down with his hot chocolate. Savors it. Sets the mug down.
RUDY: Y'know, I could really go for some onion rings.
ASHLEY: Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said.
GABRIEL: We're talking, aren't we?
GABRIEL: How much money's in that casino? I don't know.
RUDY: I don't know.
GABRIEL: The hell you don't.
RUDY: ( sighs, a guess ) Five million?
GABRIEL: You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
RUDY: Christmas. Eve.
GABRIEL: You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is. We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.

GABRIEL: We got faith in you, Nick Mason. You're our inside man.
RUDY: .goddamn it, Rudy. goddamn it. goddamn girl, goddamn Nick. you're so smart, so fucking smart.
RUDY: Where's your Christmas dinner now.
JUMPY: I've read where the retail industry does fifty percent of its business between December 1st and December 25th. Half the year's business, in one month's time. It seems to me an intelligent society would legislate a second such gift-giving holiday, create, say, a Christmas Two late May, early June to further stimulate growth and prosperity. For who would protest such a holiday? Taking the fifty percent model, a Christmas Two would grow this country's annual per capita income by close to one-third.
GABRIEL: Christmas Two.
GABRIEL: Ever since you started night school, you been givin, me headaches, Jumpy. Go see what's taking him.
GABRIEL: Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of And where they hide the real money. And Nick? If you even think about setting us up, giving us some bad information? We go down. you go Now. Christmas Eve. How many guards are there gonna be?
MERLIN: And where they hide the real money. And Nick? If you even think about setting us up, giving us some bad information? We go down. you go Now. Christmas Eve. How many guards are there gonna be?
GABRIEL: And Nick? If you even think about setting us up, giving us some bad information? We go down. you go Now. Christmas Eve. How many guards are there gonna be?
RUDY: Hell. Ten?
GABRIEL: And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
MERLIN: Start talking, Nick.
PUG: Start talkin
RUDY: Who the hell made this map.
GABRIEL: I said, who the hell made the map?
RUDY: I said, who the hell made the map?
GABRIEL: I did.
RUDY: This isn't the Tomahawk.
GABRIEL: What the fuck are you talking about.
RUDY: This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed That's what it looks like!

RUDY: Since when? What the hell is this Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
MERLIN: Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
RUDY: Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
GABRIEL: We walked the place for a week.
RUDY: And I worked there. For a year.
PUG: Map is kinda dirty, Monster.
RUDY: They changed the layout.
GABRIEL: Rudy nods, pretending to be dawned upon.
RUDY: They changed the layout whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there listen to me guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it
ASHLEY: Jack. Jack Bangs.
RUDY: Right, Jack Bangs. Uh. guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
GABRIEL: They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
RUDY: When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the. uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the. uh. .the Powwow Safe.
JUMPY: The Powwow Safe?
RUDY: His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
GABRIEL: So what the hell good are you.
RUDY: You'd have to get me inside. Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
GABRIEL: Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
PUG: So what?
GABRIEL: They recognize him, they'll remember him after the job goes down.
RUDY: They won't recognize me.
GABRIEL: Why not.
RUDY: Trust me. They won't recognize me.
GABRIEL: We'll trust you when we're rich. Why 'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
RUDY: 'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
RUDY: I give you the wrong information, you're gonna shoot me. Well, I don't know your damn map. So you can either find a way to get me in there. or you can shoot me right now.
GABRIEL: Bring back some memories, Nick?
RUDY: More than you know.
RUDY: What the hell is this? What happened to working together?
GABRIEL: Rather be back in the Mountain?
RUDY: Might as well be.
GABRIEL: Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
GABRIEL: Sleep good, loverboy. Tomorrow you got singing for your supper to do.
RUDY: Get your own room.
ASHLEY: He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters. he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he But you knew why. Knew why, didn't
RUDY: But you knew why. Knew why, didn't
ASHLEY: I thought we'd have a few more days.
RUDY: For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
ASHLEY: Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that
RUDY: Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that
ASHLEY: Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants! I hate him, Nick. you know how.
RUDY: So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
ASHLEY: Not without you.
RUDY: Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
ASHLEY: They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
RUDY: He working for them on this one?
ASHLEY: No. He wants to be working for himself And I'm his ticket. What's the last place they took down?
RUDY: And I'm his ticket. What's the last place they took down?
ASHLEY: Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
RUDY: Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
ASHLEY: I don't think they've ever robbed anything before. I think they've just driven guns.
RUDY: They've never done a robbery?
ASHLEY: ( shrugs ) They're truck drivers.
RUDY: Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me.
ASHLEY: We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this.
RUDY: We? What "we".
RUDY: Get your own room, Ashley.
ASHLEY: Get your own room.
RUDY: Get your own room.
ASHLEY: If I'd told you what he wanted, you'd have been gone. You'd have gotten on that bus and stayed on it. And if that's selfish, I am. If that's lying, I'm a liar. But I been dealing with fucked-up brother and his fucked-up friends for a long time, and I was stronger than him then and I'm stronger than him now. 'Cause he showed up for money.

PUG: Gabriel THWAPS a dart into the board, to shut them up.
MERLIN: Gabriel THWAPS a dart into the board, to shut them up.
GABRIEL: Take a look what Pug's bought for
RUDY: A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely Put it on.
GABRIEL: Put it on.
GABRIEL: You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.

GABRIEL: You got one hour.
RUDY: I'm gonna need some money.
RUDY: Ten dollars? What do I do with ten Don't tip.
GABRIEL: Don't tip.
RUDY: Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple
GABRIEL: ( threateningly ) Don't. Lose.
RUDY: You ready to gamble, darlin'?

Big time, fucking, grade-A, God- quality, S-N-O-W-snow.
JACK BANGS: There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
YOUNG GOVERNOR: We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
JACK BANGS: Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
YOUNG GOVERNOR: We're aware of your position.
JACK BANGS: ( picks up a chip ) Because down there this is money. Up here this is heat. ( pleads ) You wanted Vegas quality, I brought it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I gave it to you. But guys, please, guys. I can't get you Vegas profits. till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
OLD GOVERNOR: We understand the Paiutes' casino saw a net profit of twelve million dollars last year.
JACK BANGS: The Paiutes, they cook their books.
OLD GOVERNOR: The Waitela reservation made seventeen Perhaps you have researched this, Mr. Bangs. Is the snowfall on our side of the lake that much greater than the snowfall on theirs?
JACK BANGS: ( sobers ) Perhaps you have researched this, Mr. Bangs. Is the snowfall on our side of the lake that much greater than the snowfall on theirs?
OLD GOVERNOR: Perhaps you have researched this, Mr. Bangs. Is the snowfall on our side of the lake that much greater than the snowfall on theirs?
JACK BANGS: I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
YOUNG GOVERNOR: Mr. Bangs.
JACK BANGS: Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
YOUNG GOVERNOR: The tribe is concerned that many of your. new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
JACK BANGS: I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
YOUNG GOVERNOR: We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
OLD GOVERNOR: Like the Paiutes and the Waitela.
YOUNG GOVERNOR: We want you doing the job. that we brought you here to do.
ASHLEY: So does it look a lot different?
RUDY: Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
ASHLEY: That guy knows you?
RUDY: Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
RUDY: You start spending your brother's money. I'm gonna take a circuit around the joint, check for any new ins and outs. I'll snag us some drinks.
ASHLEY: ( sotto ) Be careful, Nick.
RUDY: Couple rum and Cokes, please.
INDIAN BARTENDER: You want that rum and Coke or rum and Pepsi?
JACK BANGS: I can't go back to Vegas, Bear. They'll fuckin' kill me, 'kay? I can't go back.
BARTENDER: What does the tribe want?
JACK BANGS: They want gold-paved roads is what they want. Talking 'bout the fuckin' Paiutes. Fuckin' Paiutes are on the interstate. Nothing I can do about that, man, I didn't pick the spot for your reservation.
BARTENDER: Neither did we.
JACK BANGS: Yeah, yeah, whatever.
JACK BANGS: Hey. Hey, cowboy. Jack Bangs, I run the place. Nice to have you in the Tomahawk. Tell me something.
JACK BANGS: .does upstate Michigan need another roadside casino or does upstate Michigan need an international gaming Roadside casino?
RUDY: ( wants outta here ) Roadside casino?
JACK BANGS: Well, so how'd you hear about this place, then. Word-of-mouth? Mass mailings? Cable TV?
RUDY: JACK BANGS
JACK BANGS: Rudy shrugs, smiles, takes off with his drinks. Bangs looks sick, turns to a FAT GUY on the next stool over. But before he can ask, the guy shakes his head
FAT GUY: I just stopped in to use the can.
JACK BANGS: I can't go back to Vegas, Bear. I
JACK BANGS: Aw fuck.
MERLIN: What the hell was that about
RUDY: He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
ASHLEY: Hey Nick! We're up fifty cents!
RUDY: Reaching Ashley, his goatee is dripping
ASHLEY: Nick, what happened
RUDY: There went my. damn. well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched. Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing drink this for me.
JUMPY: What happened?
ASHLEY: He started losing his hair.
RUDY: Hundred bucks to wear this jacket
COLLEGE KID: Jesus, man, don't kill me!
RUDY: Nobody's killing you, kid. Santa's giving you a rhinestone jacket and a hundred bucks.
MERLIN: Thanks, sister. How are ya.
WAITRESS: Fuckin' freezing.
MERLIN: Hell yeah. You work here long?
WAITRESS: Five years. Since it opened.
MERLIN: How long ago was your makeover?
WAITRESS: My what?!
MERLIN: No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around.
WAITRESS: The Tomahawk's looked the same since I started, mister. Only the losers change.
RUDY: GO! GO!
GO! GO!: The College Kid, shaking, hustles out the door.
GABRIEL: Where the hell's he going?
PUG: Where the hell's your sister?
GABRIEL: Get him!
COLLEGE KID: ( scared shitless ) Oh man. It's your jacket, isn't it.
JUMPY: INT. CASINO KITCHEN As Rudy charges toward COOKS, holding a buffet plate aloft
RUDY: MEDIUM RARE?! You call this MEDIUM
RARE??!!: hands them the plate, hurries past them, and out the
GABRIEL: Where the HELL did he go?
MERLIN: Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
PUG: That motherfucker
MERLIN: And Monster. he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
GABRIEL: Get. Him. Back.
MERLIN: You keep running, Nick! Keep running now! Can't keep warm if you don't keep running! We'll just be right back here. keeping track of your
ASHLEY: as Ashley grabs Gabriel's steering wheel, swerving the other way. Gabriel fights her for control as the Nova just misses Rudy, who dives off the road, hits the slope and tumbles head-over-heels toward its bottom, a hundred feet down, kicking up geysers of snow! On the road, the Nova skids to a stop. Ashley and Gabriel leap out, as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the road.
ASHLEY: as Ashley suddenly slams into him from behind Sending the both of them tumbling down the slope! Sliding and tangled, the rifle flying from Gabriel's grasp
RUN!!!: as Ashley suddenly slams into him from behind Sending the both of them tumbling down the slope! Sliding and tangled, the rifle flying from Gabriel's grasp
RUDY: That's for reading her mail.
RUDY: Come on.
RUDY: We get to the bridge, we're all right!
ASHLEY: Nick, the ice is
RUDY: Get to the bridge!
RUDY: Looks to the truckers in pursuit. Coming down the ridge. Then the highway. Safety within sight. But he can't run. Cursing himself, he grips the rifle tightly and LEAPS into the ice-hole
GABRIEL: ( rubs his jaw ) At the rate you're going, Nick. I'm gonna have a hard time ever considering you family.
GABRIEL: How lucky ya feeling now.
RUDY: I-I-I-I have n-n-no g-g-gifts to br- br-bring, pa rum-p-p-p-p-p .pum-pum-pum. N-n-no treasures for the k-k-k
RUDY: INT. KNIGHTS INN GAME ROOM - DAY Gabriel is hurling darts again, focused, expressionless. Merlin and Jumpy haul Rudy in. He collapses at Gabriel's feet, unable to stand. Still trembling. A couple KIDS scamper into the doorway
MERLIN: Game room's closed.
GABRIEL: A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the .never. tried.
RUDY: ( teeth chattering ) .never. tried.
GABRIEL: Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on

GABRIEL: May the best sportsman win.
GABRIEL: He steps aside for Rudy. Rudy struggles to raise his hand, trembling badly. He focuses on the board, teeth chattering, tries to reposition his fingers, rears back and throws except the dart remains in his frozen grip. He brings his icy hand back, tries to move his fingers. And the dart finally tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet. Gabriel smiles, steps close.
GABRIEL: Got something to say to me, Nick?
RUDY: .ttt..tt. two out of three?
GABRIEL: What'd you tell that casino manager?
RUDY: Nnn. nothing.
GABRIEL: You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
RUDY: Nothing. I promise-nothing.
GABRIEL: MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
RUDY: Gabriel spins to the dartboard, pulls out a fistful and wheels. He whistles a dart at Rudy's head. it SMACKS the wall beside his ear. He whistles another. It TRUNKS right above his head. A third HITS the wall by his chin.
NO!: Gabriel spins to the dartboard, pulls out a fistful and wheels. He whistles a dart at Rudy's head. it SMACKS the wall beside his ear. He whistles another. It TRUNKS right above his head. A third HITS the wall by his chin.
RUDY: He thought I was some gambler. he didn't know me. he didn't recognize I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else.
GABRIEL: I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else.
GABRIEL: .Dispatcher's screaming for me to haul ass, he's got a load on the runback for me. Shipper's making me wait for the pickup, receiver's bitching 'bout the count.
GABRIEL: .Got the cops at the bottom of every mountain, got the DOT at the top. And every day, every day, I see all those faces in their little airbag Hot Wheels, moms and pops and jam- faced kiddies, giving me that look to go to hell and get off their happy goddamn highway. Hey. They don't gotta get two thousand miles by sundown, or the gang don't eat come
GABRIEL: It's time for me. to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you. Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
RUDY: No, Gabriel. no.
RUDY: .he. he asked me. how I'd heard about his place. he didn't know it was me.
RUDY: I PROMISE YOU HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
ME!: and then lowers it. Believing he's gotten a reprieve, Rudy relaxes, his shivering coming under control.
RUDY: Man, Monster. just. just don't start trying to hit me.
GABRIEL: Nick. I been trying to hit you.
GABRIEL: Maybe that'll help sharpen your
GABRIEL: Tonight we're gonna take another look at that map. And this time you're gonna tell me what I need to know.
ASHLEY: Nick! Jesus, Nick
MERLIN: Pug's engrossed in the cartoon. They're singing in Whoville.
MERLIN: Pug snaps to. Shuts off the TV, spits some chaw on the floor and gone. Rudy and Ashley are left alone.
PUG!: Pug snaps to. Shuts off the TV, spits some chaw on the floor and gone. Rudy and Ashley are left alone.
ASHLEY: Nick, oh my God, what'd he do to you? What'd he do?
RUDY: He had some points to make.
ASHLEY: Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here
RUDY: ( near-delirium ) All I wanted. was to make it home. for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing. Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy. Aunt Mary's cranberry
ASHLEY: We'll get there, baby. we'll get .Haven't had cranberry buns. in five whole years.
RUDY: .Haven't had cranberry buns. in five whole years.
ASHLEY: Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
ASHLEY: You saved my life. You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
RUDY: You saved me.
ASHLEY: I saved you because I love you, Nick. Why'd you save me?
RUDY: Guy I was in with. car thief. I used to read your letters to him. I know they were private. I know, but. you spend twenty-four hours a day with somebody, you gotta talk, y'know? You gotta share. Or the room gets even smaller. And sometimes, I'd be reading them, and he'd close his eyes, get a smile on his face. and I'd know somewhere inside he was pretending you were writing to him He'd see your face, your pictures on the wall. Some nights I think he fell in love with you, too.
RUDY: You gave a couple guys hope, Ashley. And with hope, there ain't nothing you can't survive.
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, Nick. I'm so sorry.
RUDY: Don't say my name.
ASHLEY: I love you, Nick.
RUDY: Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
ASHLEY: ( a small frown ) I love you.
RUDY: They'll have guns.
ASHLEY: You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious I don't know.
RUDY: You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious I don't know.
ASHLEY: I don't know.
RUDY: We'll need one.
RUDY: I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
ASHLEY: Nick, what are you talking about?
RUDY: We need to find a way to make me part of it.
ASHLEY: Part of. with them?
RUDY: If we're helping them with their robbery, we're gonna be doing more than just walking away. Like that's some Christmas bonus.
RUDY: You want him outta your life? You want a real New Year to look forward If we're gonna do this. we're gonna do it to get it all.
PUG: Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
MERLIN: That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking
PUG: Hell. The guy from Joliet, those black-ass lungs were the least of his problems. Got so much smoke in him his lungs couldn't even hold it. Got into his system, man. Into his blood. Coming out his ears, man, coming out his eyes. Guy'd be walking the row, smoke'd be puffing out his
MERLIN: This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
PUG: My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
MERLIN: His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
MERLIN: ( with disgust )
GABRIEL: Start singing.
RUDY: I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- Sing it in pictures, Nick.
GABRIEL: Sing it in pictures, Nick.
RUDY: What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
MERLIN: How do we take them out?
RUDY: You gotta get someone upstairs.
MERLIN: How do we do that?
RUDY: Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
GABRIEL: What's the code?
RUDY: Uh. they change it every month. I wouldn't know. If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
PUG: Without having them hit the alarms.
RUDY: I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
MERLIN: What about the money?
RUDY: You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
JUMPY: What about the Powwow Safe?
RUDY: The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
JUMPY: The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
RUDY: Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
RUDY: So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the You need six.
GABRIEL: We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
RUDY: You need six.
GABRIEL: You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need Six is me.
RUDY: You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need Six is me.
GABRIEL: You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
RUDY: You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
ASHLEY: Yeah. What're you gonna do about it.
GABRIEL: I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
RUDY: Six men means six guns.
GABRIEL: No way.
RUDY: I'm no threat without a gun.
GABRIEL: No, you're not.
RUDY: There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster. but I gotta be a threat.
ASHLEY: What's the matter, Gabriel? This is what you wanted him for, isn't it?
GABRIEL: No gun.
RUDY: Well. What you guys have to plan out, then. is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
GABRIEL: That part, Nick. was planned out the day I read your letters.
RUDY: What. We all gonna dress up like Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
GABRIEL: Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.

RUDY: What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
MERLIN: Hell yeah.
ASHLEY: He wants to see your map.
RUDY: I'm almost done.
ASHLEY: He says he wants it now.
RUDY: If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
ASHLEY: How are we gonna do this, Nick?
RUDY: You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
ASHLEY: Bullets or no bullets, he won't do Is there any way you could get into his truck?
RUDY: Is there any way you could get into his truck?

RUDY: Gun, gun, c'mon, boys like you gotta be keeping a gun.
ON SCENE: Rudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side. Merlin and Jumpy walk right by him. Rudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars, heading away from his room's window. His window. Rudy glances back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem to. They stand at the Nova, talking. Rudy shivers, waiting. They're not leaving. When their backs turn, Rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building. He slips around the corner, out of sight.
ASHLEY: .and he's saying "We're not gonna help him just to walk away. If we're gonna help him. we're gonna get it
ASHLEY: .he wants to help now, he wants to rob it now we could probably stay right here, he'd go on and rob it by
GABRIEL: He wants the money.
ASHLEY: No, baby. He wants me.
ASHLEY: He wants. your "sister".
GABRIEL: .whoever she is.
ASHLEY: Nick Mason's gonna help us more than we ever dreamed.
GABRIEL: All those letters are about to pay off, baby. all those letters.
ASHLEY: To all those cons.
GABRIEL: Searching for a money man.
ASHLEY: We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth
GABRIEL: till he fucked his parole
ASHLEY: plus the forty to Mason. how many letters is that?
GABRIEL: That's a book, baby. That's a book of love.
GABRIEL: I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
ASHLEY: One more day, baby. One more day to I've been doing good, though.
GABRIEL: I've been doing good, though.
ASHLEY: Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
GABRIEL: Didn't have to send me down a fucking What, he should see me help you catch
ASHLEY: What, he should see me help you catch
ON RUDY: still in the shadows, welling with betrayal.
GABRIEL: Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you.
ASHLEY: Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree.
RUDY: Here's my present to you, truck Where the hell's Gabriel?
JUMPY: With his girlfriend. Making up for "Nick" time. I'm going down to the bar, you want something?
MERLIN: Get me a brew. I'm gonna check on our convict.
RUDY: Catch, dammit, catch! Like riding a bike, it's like riding a bike!
RUDY: How far you gonna get, Rudy.
MERLIN: My room.
RUDY: Merlin frowns, takes a suspicious look around the room. The window's open. Rudy continues his card game. Merlin watches him for a long time. Then pulls the door shut. Once he's gone, Rudy collapses to the floor. Breathing hard, heart pounding. The cards go flying.
ASHLEY: Merry Christmas-Eve, my love. My love, my love. Merry Christmas-Eve.
GABRIEL: Checking out.
ASHLEY: That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view. And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
GABRIEL: That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view. And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
RUDY: ( chokes, pained ) You guys were paying for the room, I just figured
GABRIEL: ( cruel smile ) You wanted a weapon, convict? You got one.
GABRIEL: Merry Christmas-Eve.
GABRIEL: Commit this thing to memory. Every guard, every exit. don't tape it to your fuckin, wrist: remember it. That's the Gospel right there. The Gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke and
ASHLEY: Where should we go, Nick? When we're gone from here. where should we
RUDY: This time right now. Dad's stacking wood out back, getting ready for tomorrow. Little blaze in the fireplace. Mom's setting out the good silver, hanging her cinammon sticks, up in the doorways. Getting out her scratchy old records. singing along.
RUDY: I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
ASHLEY: We go together, Nick. Wherever. we go together. Remember?
RUDY: Well. I'm going home.
GABRIEL: sits by the water, staring over the lake too. With a white cotton Santa beard resting on his chin. He unwraps his roast beef sandwich, pulls his beard down to his neck, and takes a savage bite. Munches away, stares to Rudy and Ashley. She meets his eyes. Gabriel smiles. And looks again to the water.
JACK BANGS: And all through the house. not a creature was stirring. Why don't you go ahead and send most of your guys home, Ed.
SECURITY BOSS: Thanks, Jack. Merry X-mas.
JACK BANGS: Hell. Nobody even comes here to
GABRIEL: Rudy gives Gabriel a withering look. He and Jumpy climb out. Gabriel's rig rumbles up the road. [NOTE: All five men, save Ashley, from now till story's end, are in their Santa Claus suits.]
RUDY: Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you something. You have any problem with the fact that we're on our way to take millions of dollars from an Indian casino?
JUMPY: Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's gone a long way toward restoring wealth and pride to communities who've been economically isolated and enslaved for centuries. Stronger infrastructure, better schools, higher employment. they're all the results of reservation casino success stories. Still, many natives believe that these are temples to a godless materialism and greed that will only infect the souls of indigenous peoples until their love of money has destroyed the spiritual values their ancestors died to protect and their homelands have become no different from any United States suburb, satellite city or industrial park. Destroying the Indian legacy once and for all and leaving behind a nation of selfish, angry natives, of which I, it's true, am one
RUDY: Hey-hey, egg nog for everybody!

Jumpy can't get down, as BULLETS riddle him dead and BLOW OUT the smoked windows overlooking the casino Jack Bangs keeps turning in a madman's circle BLOWING OUT the windows to the parking lot, shattering the liquor, sending Rudy scrambling under his desk

GABRIEL: With the wrong fucking guy! We took the place down with the wrong fucking guy! Is that Christmas?! Huh?! Is that Christmas?!
GABRIEL: God bless us every one.
GABRIEL: You almost got away with it, Santa. Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your car, got halfway to Canada till you caught some ice in the road. By the time you hit bottom down there, whole car was burning like a comet. Musta burned up all that money too.
GABRIEL: Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember. if it was three, or four. or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
RUDY: Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it
GABRIEL: She told me 'bout the convict magazines. Had to figure there'd be some boys in the pen with some useful knowledge. With nobody to talk to. Nobody to listen. So we stocked up on stationery.
GABRIEL: Hard life being a trucker's girl.
RUDY: I saved your life.
ASHLEY: You shouldn't have.
RUDY: He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
ASHLEY: Who wouldn't.
RUDY: Maybe this is where you wanted him, Ashley. At the bottom of a ravine, dead as ice with a burnt-up heart. Maybe. But it didn't happen. 'Cause what you did for him was make him the happiest held ever been. You showed him hope and taught him mercy. And he died a peaceful man. You wanted to destroy some convict. and all you did was save his soul. Remember that. Love your money and remember
ASHLEY: Merry Christmas, Rudy.
RUDY: I'm glad it was me.
ASHLEY: Merry Christmas.
GABRIEL: Get in the car.
GABRIEL: Get in the CAR!
RUDY: How'd you know my name.
ASHLEY: Rudy. How'd you know my name?
RUDY: Rudy. How'd you know my name?
ASHLEY: What are you talking about?
RUDY: You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
ASHLEY: I. you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe But I never said Rudy.
RUDY: You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe But I never said Rudy.
ASHLEY: You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe But I never said Rudy.
RUDY: But I never said Rudy.
ASHLEY: You said it a million times!
RUDY: I never told you my name.
GABRIEL: How'd you know my name was Rudy.
RUDY: How'd you know my name was Rudy.
GABRIEL: How'd you know my name.
RUDY: How'd you know my name.
ASHLEY: and pulls a handgun, SHOOTING Gabriel in the heart. Gabriel falls to his knees in the snow, his mouth a ring of shock. Blood spurts through his red coat. He stares at Ashley, She steps forward and PUTS another bullet in his neck. Gabriel falls still. Ashley's breath frosts in the cold. Rudy watches her. Finally, she meets Rudy's eyes. They stare each other down for a long moment, before:
RUDY: Where is he.
NICK: Merry Christmas, Rudy.
NICK: I missed you, beautiful.
ASHLEY: I missed you too, Nicky baby.
ASHLEY: For your information. I never fuck the wrong guy.
NICK: Oh, hey. Have you two been properly introduced? Sweetness, this is Rudy Duncan, I did almost a year with him in the Mountain. Read him all your letters, talked about you all the time, made him feel like he really knew you. My friend. wantcha to meet Millie Bobek. 'Member Millie Bobek, dontcha? My girlfriend fore I went in? Worked at that bar in Motor City, where I manslaughtered that guy? Hell. Didn't talk about her much once the Ashley letters started coming, I guess.
NICK: Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
RUDY: She set them up. All of them.
NICK: Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
RUDY: And you set me up.
NICK: Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
NICK: Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up. Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
RUDY: How'd you know I'd do it.
NICK: Do what?
RUDY: Walk outta there and tell her I was
NICK: Because every time I read her letters, Rudy. you listened. Keep your gun on him.
NICK: Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk, Rudy. That's what the witnesses'll say. So we gotta have five Santas not walk out. Gotta have five. This'll burn right away. in the
NICK: Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by
RUDY: Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
NICK: Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
NICK: They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
RUDY: You gave them me.
NICK: I gave them me. Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
NICK: Sweetness! Let's light up the tree!
NICK: Goodbye, Rudy! Nice spending time with you!
RUDY: LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIIIIIKE!
RUDY: RULE ONE! NEVER PUT A CAR THIEF BEHIND THE WHEEL!
THE WHEEL!: and SLAMS the accelerator.
ASHLEY: Then Rudy faces front, pounds the shift into "Drive."
NOOOOOOO!!!: Then Rudy faces front, pounds the shift into "Drive."
RUDY: RULE TWO!
RULE TWO!: Ashley stands at the bottom of the ramp, vengeance and rage. She grabs her handgun, OPENS FIRE and Rudy SLAMS the gas again, shooting down the ramp as he flings open the car door, dives and rolls while the burning Nova COLLIDES with Ashley, throwing her onto the hood, and sending the tandem inferno speeding off the ridgetop arcing slowly as it PLUMMETS into the ravine, a smoking, blazing shooting star with a woman's figure hanging on. The shooting star hits Earth and explodes.
NICK: .Rudy. help me. Rudy.
MOTHER: Rudy.? Rudy?
FATHER: Son? Is. is that you.?
