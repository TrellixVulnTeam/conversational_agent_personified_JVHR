CAPTAIN TYPHO: there was no danger at all. The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN ( VERSE ) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation. The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed. Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.
PADMÉ: She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cordé's eyes are open. She looks up at her.
CORDÉ: . I'm sorry, m'lady. I'm. not sure I. CORDÉ dies. PADMÉ hugs her.
AMIDALA: No!. No!. No!. PADMÉ lowers CORDÉ to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes.
AMIDALA: I should not have come back.
CAPTAIN TYPHO: M'Lady, you are still in danger. Amidala says nothing.
CAPTAIN TYPHO: This vote is very important. You did your duty and Cordé did hers. Now come. ( she doesn't respond ) M'Lady, She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them.
MAS AMEDDA: Order! We shall have order! The motion for the Republic to commission an army takes precedent, and that is what we will vote on at this time. Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.
PALPATINE: .My esteemed colleagues, excuse me. I have just received some tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of the Naboo system. Has been assassinated! There is a shock silence in the vast arena.
PALPATINE: ( continued ) This grievous blow is especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice, not only in this honourable assembly, but also on her home planet. She was so loved she could have been elected queen for life. She believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom. and as a dear friend. There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.
AMBASSADOR DARSANA: Why weren't the Jedi able to stop this assassination? We are no longer safe, under their protection. Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.
PALPATINE: Must I remind the Senator from Malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists. Peace is our objective here. not The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.
AMIDALA: My noble colleagues, I concur with the Supreme Chancellor. At all costs, we do not want war! The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and It is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala.
PALPATINE: It is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala.
PADMÉ: Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but, more importantly, I believe this security measure before you, was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army. but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it's Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.
PADMÉ: ( continuing ) I warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do not wish to do it There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.
PADMÉ: Wake up, Senators. you must wake up! If you offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannot believe they do. There is an undercurrent of booing. and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.
PALPATINE: Due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion, we will take up these matters tomorrow. Until then, the Senate stands adjourned.
PALPATINE: I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.
MACE WINDU: If they do break away -
PALPATINE: No! I will not let that happen!
MACE WINDU: But if they do, you must realise there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
PALPATINE: Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war? YODA closes his eyes.
YODA: Worse than war, I fear. Much What do you sense, Master?
PALPATINE: MACE WINDU What do you sense, Master?
MACE WINDU: What do you sense, Master?
YODA: Impossible to see . The Dark Side clouds everything. But this I am sure of - Do their duty the Jedi will. A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears on the Chancellor's desk.
DAR WAC: The loyalist committee has arrived, my Lord.
PALPATINE: Send them in. They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter the office. YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps AMIDALA with his cane.
YODA: With you the force is strong. young Senator. To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.
PADMÉ: Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?
MACE WINDU: Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo.
PADMÉ: I don't wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind There is a stir of surprise.
MACE WINDU: You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn't assassinate anyone, it is not in his character.
YODA: In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are. PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.
PALPATINE: Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end?
PADMÉ: I don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it. After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces.
PALPATINE: Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces.
BAIL ORGANA: Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the.
PADMÉ: Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the.
PALPATINE: ."situation is that serious." No, but I do, Senator.
PADMÉ: Chancellor, please! I don't want any more guards!
PALPATINE: I realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with. an old friend like. Master Kenobi. PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.
MACE WINDU: That's possible. He has just returned from a Border dispute on You must remember him, M'Lady. he watched over you during the blockade conflict.
PALPATINE: You must remember him, M'Lady. he watched over you during the blockade conflict.
PADMÉ: This is not necessary, Chancellor.
PALPATINE: Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable. AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.
MACE WINDU: I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M'Lady. YODA leans into her ear.
YODA: Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padmé. Accept our help. As the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk.
PALPATINE: I will not like this Republiv, that has stood for over a thousand years, be split in two
JAR JAR: Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo! OBI-WAN smiles.
JAR JAR: Oops! Wheresa mesa manners? Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I completely forgot myself for a moment there. I have had to learn Diplodiaclect. speak it like a native now. Don't really see the point, actually, but members of the Senate seem to prefer it. JAR JAR notices OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE.
JAR JAR: ( continuing ) .and this, I take it, is your apprentice. Nooooooooo! Annie? Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie? ( Looks at Anakin ) Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen! Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no Hi, Jar Jar. JAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug.
ANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar. JAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug.
JAR JAR: Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!
JAR JAR: Lookie. lookie. Oops!. Oh, dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten myself again. PADME and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADME. She glances at him.
PADMÉ: It has been far too long Master Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths have crossed again. but I must warn you that I think your presence here is unnecessary.
PADMÉ: ( stares ) My goodness you've grown. They look at each other for a long moment.
ANAKIN: ( trying to be smooth ) So have you. grown more beautiful, I mean. and much shorter. for a Senator, I mean. OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADME laughs and shakes her head.
PADMÉ: Oh Annie, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine. This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO smile.
CAPTAIN TYPHO: I am very grateful you are here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit.
PADMÉ: I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me.
ANAKIN: We will find out who is trying to kill you Padmé, I promise you. He's done it again. He bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a dirty look.
ANAKIN: I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.
ANAKIN: Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security. not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one.
ANAKIN: Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security. not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one.
PADMÉ: Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now if you will excuse me I will retire. Everyone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORME leave the room.
CAPTAIN TYPHO: Well, I know I feel a lot better having you here. I'll have an officer on every floor and I'll be at the command centre downstairs.
JAR JAR: Mesa busten wit happiness seein Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad times, bombad times. Captain Typho leaves.
ANAKIN: She didn't even recognise me, Jar Jar. I thought about her every day since we parted. and she's forgotten me completely.
JAR JAR: Shesa happy. Happier den mesa see-en her in longo time.
ANAKIN: Yes, my master.
MACE WINDU: Why couldn't we see this attack on the Senator?
YODA: Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force.
MACE WINDU: The propecy is coming true, the Dark Side is growing.
YODA: And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future. Only going through the Dark Side can we It's been ten years, and the Sith still have no shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this?
MACE WINDU: It's been ten years, and the Sith still have no shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this?
YODA: .Out there, they are. A certainty that is.
MACE WINDU: Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice will be able to bring balance to the Force?
YODA: Only if he chooses to follow his There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.
ANAKIN: Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her. OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed.
ANAKIN: She covered that camera. I don't think she liked me watching her.
ANAKIN: She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder.
ANAKIN: I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master?
ANAKIN: It was her idea. No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.
ANAKIN: And yours are?
ANAKIN: I don't sleep well, anymore.
ANAKIN: I don't know why I keep dreaming About her now. I haven't seen her since I was little.
ANAKIN: I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just Being around her again is. Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi order. a commitment not easily broken. and don't forget she's a politician. They're not to be She's not like the others in the Senate, Master.
ANAKIN: She's not like the others in the Senate, Master.
ANAKIN: Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics.. It's too early in the morning. and besides, you're generalising. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.
ANAKIN: I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive ANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN
ANAKIN: Stay here! CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.
ANAKIN: That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic.
ANAKIN: Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit. and with the right speed capabilities. and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color. They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.
ANAKIN: I thought I already did.
ANAKIN: Sorry, I forgot you don't like flying, Master.
ANAKIN: Master, you know I've been flying since before I could walk. I'm very good at this.
ANAKIN: Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now! ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.
ANAKIN: Right - this isn't working. ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.
ANAKIN: Clear that!
ANAKIN: Clear the flag! We're losing power! Hurry! OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.
ANAKIN: So sorry, Master. They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.
ANAKIN: Sorry, Master!
ANAKIN: That was crazy!!! ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.
ANAKIN: ( continuing ) Ahh, damn.
ANAKIN: No, we can make it. ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.
ANAKIN: But it worked. we made it.
ANAKIN: I think we're still alive. ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.
ANAKIN: ( sheepishly ) I could have made it.
ANAKIN: No we didnt. Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right
ANAKIN: This is a shortcut. I think.
ANAKIN: Master, if we keep this chase going, that creeps gonna end up deep fried. Personally, Id very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who hes working Oh, so thats why were going in the wrong direction. ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.
ANAKIN: Im deeply sorry, Master. ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.
ANAKIN: ( continuing ) Excuse me for a moment. ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zams speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunters speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened. ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeders cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM cant reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop. OBI-WAN has jumped into the drivers seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passengers seat. ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAMS hand. She grabs the Jedis hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of its nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunters speeder. Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.
ANAKIN: She went into that club, Master.
ANAKIN: Sorry, Master. ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.
ANAKIN: Yes, Master. He reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.
ANAKIN: I know, Master.
ANAKIN: I've heard this lesson before. OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.
ANAKIN: I try, Master.
ANAKIN: Don't say that Master. You're the closest thing I have to a father. I love you. I don't want to cause you pain.
ANAKIN: I will. I'll do better, I promise.
ANAKIN: I think he's a she.
ANAKIN: Where are you going, Master?
ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO: Wanna buy some death sticks? OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.
ELAN: I don't want to sell you death- OBI-WAN moves his fingers.
ELAN: I want to go home and rethink my He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back. CLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar. ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back. The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads. The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.
ANAKIN: Easy. Official business. Go back to your drinks. Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.
ZAM WESSEL: The Senator from Naboo.
ZAM WESSEL: It was just a job.
ANAKIN: Tell us!
ZAM WESSEL: That Senator's gonna die soon anyway, and the next one won't make the same mistake I did.
ANAKIN: Who hired you? Tell us. tell us ZAM glares hatefully.
ZAM: It was a Bounty Hunter called. There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in surprise and dies. There is a WEOOSH from above. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up yo see an ARMOURED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above. OBI-WAN looks down at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking dart.
PADMÉ: Representative Binks. I know I can count on you.
JAR JAR: Yousa betchen mesa bottums.
PADMÉ: JAR JAR ( coughs, recovers ) Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean, I am honoured to accept this heavy burden. I take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride. ( pompously ) It is not every day that I am called upon to. PADME kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns red.
JAR JAR: ( coughs, recovers ) Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean, I am honoured to accept this heavy burden. I take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride. ( pompously ) It is not every day that I am called upon to. PADME kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns red.
PADMÉ: You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I don't wish to hold you up. I'm sure you have a great deal to do.
JAR JAR: Of course, M'lady. JAR JAR bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling smile. PADME is in a very bad mood.
PADMÉ: I do not like this idea of hiding.
ANAKIN: Don't worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter.
PADMÉ: ( frustrated ) I haven't worked for a year to defeat the "Military Creation Act" not to be here when its fate is Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time.
ANAKIN: Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time.
PADMÉ: Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time.
ANAKIN: Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying Annie! No!
PADMÉ: Annie! No!
ANAKIN: Please don't call me that.
PADMÉ: I've always called you that. it is your name, isn't it?
ANAKIN: I've always called you that. it is your name, isn't it?
PADMÉ: I've always called you that. it is your name, isn't it?
ANAKIN: It's Anakin. When you say Annie it's like I'm still a little boy. and I'm not.
PADMÉ: I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible to deny you've. .that you've grown up. PADME smiles at ANAKIN. He becomes a little shy.
ANAKIN: Master Obi-Wan manages not to see Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.
PADMÉ: Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.
ANAKIN: Don't get me wrong. Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only. although I'm a Padawan learner, in some ways. a lot of ways. I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable. Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it. I know I started my training late. but he won't let me move That must be frustrating.
PADMÉ: That must be frustrating.
ANAKIN: It's worse. he's overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn't understand! It's not PADME cannot surpress a laugh. She shakes her head.
PADMÉ: I'm sorry. You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didn't get his way.
ANAKIN: I'm not whining! I'm not. PADME just smiles at him. DORME laughs in the background.
PADMÉ: I didn't say it to hurt you.
ANAKIN: I know. There is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN.
PADME: They look into each other's eyes for the first time.
PADMÉ: ( continuing ) Don't try to grow up too fast.
ANAKIN: I am grown up. You said it ANAKIN looks deep into PADME'S eyes.
PADMÉ: Please don't look at me like that.
ANAKIN: Why not?
PADMÉ: Because I can see what you're Ahh. so, you have Jedi powers DORME is watching with concern.
ANAKIN: ( laughing ) Ahh. so, you have Jedi powers DORME is watching with concern.
PADMÉ: It makes me feel uncomfortable.
ANAKIN: Sorry, M'lady. ANAKIN backs away as PADME turns and goes back to her packing.
CAPTAIN TYPHO: Be safe, m'lady.
PADMÉ: Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme. the threat's on you two now.
DORME: He'll be safe with me. They laugh, and PADME embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORME start to weep.
PADMÉ: You'll be fine.
DORME: It's not me, M'Lady. I worry about you. What if they realise I'm not you?
PADMÉ: ( looks to Anakin ) Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is. DORME and PADME smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside.
ANAKIN: Yes, Master.
PADMÉ: I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.
ANAKIN: Time to go.
PADMÉ: I know. PADME gives DORME a last hug. ANAKIN picks up the luggage, and the TWO PEASANTS exit the speeder bus, where ARTOO is waiting for them.
ANAKIN: May the Force be with you, Master. They head off toward the giant Starfreighter.
PADMÉ: Suddenly, I'm afraid.
ANAKIN: I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own.
PADMÉ: There's nothing to worry about. we have Artoo with us. The two laugh. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO watch ANAKIN and PADME disappear into the vastness of the spaceport with ARTOO trundling along behind them.
CAPTAIN TYPHO: I'd be more concerned about her doing something, than him.
SERVER: Keep moving! Keep moving! ARTOO slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. A SERVER sees him.
FOOD SERVER: ( continuing ) Hey! No Droids! ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless.
ANAKIN: No, no, Mom, no. He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.
ANAKIN: ( continuing ) You seemed to be having a ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.
PADMÉ: You seemed to be having a ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.
PADMÉ: ( continuing ) Are you hungry?
ANAKIN: Thank you.
PADMÉ: We went into lightspeed a while ANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes.
ANAKIN: I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare.
PADMÉ: You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.
ANAKIN: I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi. not being able to visit the places you like. or do the things you Or be with the people I love.
PADMÉ: It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi. not being able to visit the places you like. or do the things you Or be with the people I love.
ANAKIN: Or be with the people I love.
PADMÉ: Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.
ANAKIN: Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.
PADMÉ: You have changed so much
ANAKIN: You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.
PADMÉ: It hasn't.
ANAKIN: I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force, those hills are what I see. ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.
ANAKIN: ( continuing ) I love Naboo. There is an awkward moment.
PADMÉ: ( changing the subject ) Were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you?
ANAKIN: Yes. I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it. Recently I've been seeing her in my dreams. vivid dreams. scary dreams. I worry about her. PADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.
HERMIONE: Can I help ya?
HERMIONE BAGWA: Waddya want him for?
HERMIONE BAGWA: Someone to see ya, honey A Jedi, by the looks of him. Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through.
DEXTER JETTSTER: Hey, Dex.
DEXTER JETTSTER: Take a seat! Be right with ya! OBI-WAN sits in a booth.
HERMIONE BAGWA: You want a cup of ardees?
DEXTER JETTSTER: Hey, ol' buddy!
DEXTER JETTSTER: So, my friend. What can I do for You can tell me what this is. OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX'S eyes widen. He puts down his mug.
DEXTER JETTSTER: Well, whattaya know. DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.
DEXTER JETTSTER: ( continuing ) I ain't seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim!
DEXTER JETTSTER: This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino Kamino Kyberdart. I wonder why it didn't show up in any analysis It's these funny little cuts on the side give it away. Those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn't be here, would we? Kamino. doesn't sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?
DEXTER JETTSTER: It's these funny little cuts on the side give it away. Those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn't be here, would we? Kamino. doesn't sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?
DEXTER JETTSTER: No, it's beyond the Outer Rim. I'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damned good ones, too. OBI-WAN then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.
DEXTER JETTSTER: It depends.
DEXTER JETTSTER: On how good your manners are. and how big your pocketbook is.
ANAKIN: If I grew up here, I don't think I'd ever leave.
PADMÉ: ( laughing ) I doubt that.
ANAKIN: No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about. The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers.
PADMÉ: .and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital, I was very young. I'd never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful. I never dreamed one day I'd live in the Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?
ANAKIN: Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?
PADMÉ: ( laughing ) No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the "Refugee Relief Movement." I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I joined the "Apprentice Legislators", then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.
ANAKIN: The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.
PADMÉ: Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now. My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids. but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.
ANAKIN: I agree! I think the Republic needs you. I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound I think so too. ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.
PADMÉ: I think so too. ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.
QUEEN JAMILLIA: We've been worried about you. I'm so glad you're safe, Padmé.
PADMÉ: Thank you, Your Highness. I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote.
SIO BIBBLE: Given the circumstances, Senator, you know it was the only decision Her Highness could have made.
QUEEN JAMILLIA: How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?
PADMÉ: About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.
SIO BIBBLE: It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic!
QUEEN JAMILLIA: Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?
PADMÉ: Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.
QUEEN JAMILLIA: The armies of commerce! Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?
PADMÉ: I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds.
SIO BIBBLE: It's outrageous! After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?
QUEEN JAMILLIA: Remember, Counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. That's a move in the right There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.
PADMÉ: There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.
ANAKIN: The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.
QUEEN JAMILLIA: We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.
PADMÉ: Let's pray that day never comes.
QUEEN JAMILLIA: In the meantime, we must consider your own safety. SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.
SIO BIBBLE: ( to Anakin ) What is your suggestion, Master Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking.
PADMÉ: Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking.
ANAKIN: ( nettled ) Hey, hold on a minute!
PADMÉ: Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.
ANAKIN: Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady. SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here.
PADMÉ: Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well. that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
ANAKIN: ( takes a deep breath ) Sorry, M'Lady.
SIO BIBBLE: ( to Anakin, amused ) She is right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain.
QUEEN JAMILLIA: Perfect. It's settled then. ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave.
QUEEN JAMILLIA: ( continued ) Padmé, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave. your family's very worried about you. PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase.
JOCASTA NU: Did you call for assistance?
JOCASTA NU: He has a powerful face, doesn't he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing.
JOCASTA NU: ( sighs ) The Lost Twenty. and Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the Order.
JOCASTA NU: Well, one might say, he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council. much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
JOCASTA NU: Oh, yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers. JOCASTA NU stares at the bust
JOCASTA NU: ( continuing He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was. unique. In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.
JOCASTA NU: Well, I'm sure you didn't call me over here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem, Master Yes, I'm trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts.
JOCASTA NU: Kamino? It's not a system I'M familiar with. Let me see. JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.
JOCASTA NU: ( continuing ) Are you sure you have the right ( nodding ) According to my information, it should be in this quadrant somewhere. just south of the Rishi Maze. JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.
JOCASTA NU: No co-ordinates? It sounds like the kind of directions you'd get from a street tout. some old miner or Furbog trader.
JOCASTA NU: Are you sure it exists?
JOCASTA NU: Let me do a gravitational scan. OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU studt the star map hologram.
JOCASTA NU: There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet you're looking for was destroyed.
JOCASTA NU: It ought to be. Unless it was very I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist.
JOCASTA NU: The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back at the map.
PADME: There's my house! PADME starts forward; ANAKIN hangs back.
PADME: ( continuing ) What? Don't say you're shy!
ANAKIN: ( untruthfully ) No, but I. Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO ( age 6 ) and POOJA ( age 4 ). They come running toward PADME.
PADME: Ryoo!! Pooja!! PADME scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them.
PADME: ( continuing ) I'm so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja. ANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then:
SOLA: ( over her shoulder ) They're eating over at Jev Narran's later, Mom. They just had a snack. They'll be fine. SOLA puts the bowl down on the table, where ANAKIN, PADME and RUWEE NABERRIE ( Padme's father ) are coming into the room.
PADME: Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.
SOLA: Hello, Anakin.
ANAKIN: SOLA sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE ( Padme's mother ) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food.
JOBAL: You're just in time for dinner. I hope you're hungry, Anakin.
ANAKIN: A little.
PADME: He's being polite, Mom. We're You came to the right place at the right time. Sit down, son. EVERYONE sits and starts passing food.
RUWEE: ( grinning ) You came to the right place at the right time. Sit down, son. EVERYONE sits and starts passing food.
JOBAL: ( to Padme ) Honey, it's so good to see you safe. We were so worried. PADME gives JOBAL a dirty look. RUWEE smiles as he watches.
RUWEE: I know, I know. but I had to say it. Now it's done.
JOBAL: I know, I know. but I had to say it. Now it's done.
SOLA: Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.
PADME: ( rolls her eyes ) Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.
JOVAL: A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They didn't tell us it was that serious!
PADME: It's not, Mom, I promise. Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis? They nod.
PADME: ( continuing ) He grew up.
JOBAL: Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven't you had enough of that life? I certainly Mom, I'm not in any danger.
PADME: Mom, I'm not in any danger.
RUWEE: ( to Anakin ) Is she?
ANAKIN: .Yes. I'm afraid she is.
PADME: ( quickly ) But not much.
RUWEE: Sometimes I wish I'd traveled more. but I must say, I'm happy Padme tells me you teach at the Yes, and before that, I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement, when I was very young.
ANAKIN: Padme tells me you teach at the Yes, and before that, I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement, when I was very young.
RUWEE: ( nodding ) Yes, and before that, I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement, when I was very young.
SOLA: Why haven't you told us about him?
PADMÉ: What's there to talk about? He's just a boy.
SOLA: A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you?
PADMÉ: Sola - stop it!
SOLA: It's obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven't noticed?
PADMÉ: I'm not your baby sister, Sola. Anakin and I are friends. our relationship is strictly Mom, would you tell her to stop it?
SOLA: ( laughing ) Well, maybe you haven't noticed the way he looks at you. I think you're afraid to.
PADMÉ: Cut it out.
JOBAL: Sola's just concerned. we all Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What I'm doing is important.
PADMÉ: Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What I'm doing is important.
JOBAL: You've done your service, Padmé. It's time you had a life of your own. You're missing so much!
RUWEE: Now tell me, son. How serious is this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in?
ANAKIN: There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there'll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I'm sure he'll find out who they are. This situation, won't last long.
RUWEE: I don't want anything to happen to I don't either.
ANAKIN: I don't either.
PADME: Don't worry, this won't take long.
ANAKIN: I just want to get there before PADME goes on packing. ANAKIN looks around the room.
ANAKIN: ( continuing ) You still live at home.
PADME: I move around so much, I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.
ANAKIN: I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was. ANAKIN picks up a framed hologram.
ANAKIN: ( continuing ) Is this you? The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.
PADME: That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula, which means sweethear. He was so full of life,. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him, but he died. they all did. They were never able to adapt. to live off their native planet. ANAKIN picks up another hologram. It shows PADME at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.
PADME: ( continuing ) My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference? PADME pulls a face. ANAKIN grins. She continues packing. ANAKIN sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the the stern, unsmiling adolescent.
YODA: Don't think. feel. be as one with the Force. Help you, it will. Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him. The CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers.
YODA: ( continuing ) Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan.
CHILDREN: Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!
YODA: What help to you, can I be?
YODA: An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try. The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.
YODA: Most interesting. Gravitys silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be? There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.
CHILDREN: Thats right! Yes! Thats what happened! Someone erased it!
YODA: Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will.
YODA: ( frowning ) Much harder to answer, that question is.
PADMÉ: When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water.
ANAKIN: I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet. PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.
PADMÉ: .We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us. and try to guess the names of the birds I dont like sand. Its coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everythings soft. and He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.
ANAKIN: I dont like sand. Its coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everythings soft. and He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.
PADMÉ: There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.
ANAKIN: ( looks into her eyes ) Everything here is magical.
PADMÉ: You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real. but it wasnt.
ANAKIN: Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway. They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin.
PADMÉ: I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself.
ANAKIN: I think it's true. ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away.
PADMÉ: I shouldn't have done that.
ANAKIN: I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own.
PADMÉ: It's the situation. the stress. He looks at her.
ANAKIN: .the view.
MACE WINDU: Be wary, this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger.
YODA: The Council is confident in this decision, He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, he weill be the one to bring balance to the Force.
MACE: He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, he weill be the one to bring balance to the Force.
MACE WINDU: There's something else?
MACE WINDU: He has a. an emotional connection with her. It's been there since he was boy. Now he's confused. distracted.
MACE WINDU: Probing the Dark Side is a dangerous process. He could be in seclusion for days. May the force be with you.
PADME: You did that? ANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence.
ANAKIN: PADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her.
PADME: That! Now stop it! PADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.
PADME: ( continuing ) ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.
ANAKIN: I'm not really supposed to do that. for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be very grumpy. ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to PADME. She bites it out of the air and laughs.
ANAKIN: May I tell you something?
PADME: I don't know.
ANAKIN: Then how can I tell you?
PADME: Maybe you should use your Jedi It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle. I can only think of you.
ANAKIN: It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle. I can only think of you.
PADME: Anakin, don't.
ANAKIN: From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask. Silence. The logs flame in the hearth.
ANAKIN: ( continuing ) If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.
PADME: .I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.
ANAKIN: Anything's possible. Padme, please listen.
PADME: You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go. regardless of the way we feel about each other.
ANAKIN: Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.
PADME: Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities. your future, for me.
ANAKIN: I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away. but I I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love. There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.
PADME: I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love. There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.
ANAKIN: It wouldn't have to be that way. we could keep it a secret.
PADME: Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that? Silence for a moment.
ANAKIN: .No, you're right. It would destroy us.
TAUN WE: Welcome to Tipoca City, Master OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes.
TAUN WE: Everything is ready. The Prime Minister expects you.
TAUN WE: Of course! He is anxious to see you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now please, this OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor. Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously.
TAUN WE: May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino. and this is Master Jedi.
LAMA SU: LAMA SU indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech.
LAMA SU: I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season.
LAMA SU: And now to business. You will be delighted to hear we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million well on the way.
LAMA SU: Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas that we have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full. He is well, I hope?
LAMA SU: Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?
LAMA SU: ( rising ) You must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.
PADMÉ: I don't know.
ANAKIN: Sure you do. you just don't want to tell me.
PADMÉ: Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
ANAKIN: They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.
PADMÉ: All right. his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I. very cute. dark curly hair. dreamy All right, I get the picture. whatever happened to him?
ANAKIN: All right, I get the picture. whatever happened to him?
PADMÉ: I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist.
ANAKIN: Maybe he was the smart one.
PADME: You really don't like politicians, do you?
ANAKIN: I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works.
PADME: How would you have it work?
ANAKIN: We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.
PADME: That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.
ANAKIN: Then they should be made to.
PADME: By whom? Who's going to make them?
ANAKIN: I don't know. Someone.
PADME: Of course not me.
ANAKIN: Of course not me.
PADME: But someone.
ANAKIN: Someone wise.
PADME: That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me. A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.
ANAKIN: Well, if it works. PADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile.
PADMÉ: You're making fun of me.
ANAKIN: ( sarcastic ) On no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.
PADMÉ: You're so bad! PADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.
ANAKIN: You're always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders. ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh. ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK. The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away. ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.
LAMA SU: ( beaming ) Magnificent, aren't they? OBI-WAN nods slowly.
LAMA SU: We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question.
LAMA SU: A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand- picked Jango Fett himself.
LAMA SU: Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases.
LAMA SU: Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious isn't it?
LAMA SU: Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile. and no growth acceleration.
TAUN WE: I would be most happy to arrange it, for you. TAUN WE bows, and leaves.
LAMA SU: Oh yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time. Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sido-dyas first placed the order, and they're already mature. OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES.
LAMA SU: About five years ago.
LAMA SU: They're immensely superior to droids, capable of independent thought and action.
LAMA SU: I'd hoped you would be pleased. OBI-WAN gazes at the nearest embryos.
LAMA SU: Himself? Of course not. This army is for the Republic?
LAMA SU: We are also very much agasint this Count Dooku and his seccessionist movement. We are proud to be of help to the Republic.
TAUN WE: I have arranged for you to meet Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep TAUN WE goes. The door slides closed behind him. OBI-WAN looks around, then moves swiftly to check the room over. Finally, satisfied, he takes out his comlink.
MACE WINDU: No. Whoever placed that order was not a Jedi, I can assure you.
YODA: Who he is working for. discover that, you must.
WINDU: A clone army! Ordered by someone in the Senate perhaps. Someone's out to start a war.
YODA: Inform the chancellor of this, we Who do you think this impostor Sido-Dyas, could be? YODA stares back at MACE WINDU, then slowly shakes his head.
WINDU: Who do you think this impostor Sido-Dyas, could be? YODA stares back at MACE WINDU, then slowly shakes his head.
ANAKIN: no, don't!
ANAKIN: ( eyes closed ) Don't go.
PAMDE: I don't want to disturb you.
ANAKIN: Your presence is soothing. Brief pause.
PADME: You had a nightmare again last Jedi don't have nightmares.
ANAKIN: Jedi don't have nightmares.
PADME: I heard you. ANAKIN'S opens his eyes and looks at her.
ANAKIN: I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain.They're killing her! I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a Annie, I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your What about Master Obi-wan? PADME smiles and takes his hand.
PADME: Annie, I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your What about Master Obi-wan? PADME smiles and takes his hand.
ANAKIN: What about Master Obi-wan? PADME smiles and takes his hand.
PADME: I guess we won't tell him, will we?
TAUN WE: Boba, is your father here? There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods.
TAUN WE: ( continuing ) May we see him?
BOBA FETT: Another brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE and OBI-WAN go through.
BOBA FETT: Dad! Taun We's here! JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion.
TAUN WE: Welcome back, Jango. Was your trip productive?
JANGO FETT: OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of them.
TAUN WE: This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's come to check on our That right? JANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.
JANGO FETT: That right? JANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.
JANGO FETT: I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi.
JANGO: Once or twice.
JANGO: ( eyes Obi-Wan carefully ) Then you must know Master Sido- Boba, close the door. BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN.
JANGO: Boba, close the door. BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN.
JANGO: ( continuing ) Master who?
JANGO: Never heard of him. I was recuited by a man called Darth Tyranus on one of the moons of No? I thought.
TAUN WE: Sido-Dyas told us to expect him. And he showed up just when your Jedi Master said he would. We have kept the Jedis involvement a secret until your arrival, just as your Master requested.
JANGO: Do you like your army?
JANGO: ( grinning ) They'll do their job well, I'll guarantee that.
JANGO: Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE go out. The door slides closed. JANGO FETT turns to his son. He is deep in thought.
BOBA: What is it, Dad?
ANAKIN: ( to the droid driver ) Wait, please. ANAKIN and PADME get down. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop is WATTO. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to help him, but they seem only to make him madder.
WATTO: ( yelling, in Huttese ) No, not that one - that one!
ANAKIN: ( arriving ) Excuse me, Watto.
WATTO: ( in Huttese ) ( in Huttese ) I said excuse me. WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.
ANAKIN: ( in Huttese ) I said excuse me. WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.
WATTO: ( in Huttese ) Shut down. The PIT DROIDS snap into their storage position.
WATTO: ( continuing, in Huttese ) What? I don't know you. What can I do for you? You look like a Jedi. Whatever it is. I didn't do it. WATTO drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese
ANAKIN: Let me help you with that. ANAKIN takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it. WATTO blinks in surprise.
ANAKIN: ( continuing ) I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker. WATTO looks at him suspiciously. He stares at PADME, then back to ANAKIN.
WATTO: Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!! Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin's hands WHIRS into life. WATTO blinks at it.
WATTO: ( continuing; in English ) You are Annie! It is you! You little womp rat. WATTO gives ANAKIN a big hug.
WATTO: ( continuing ) You sure sprouted Weehoo! A Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe you couldda help wit some daedbeats who owe.
ANAKIN: My mother.
WATTO: Oh, yeah. Shmi. she's not mine no more. I sold her.
ANAKIN: Sold her.
WATTO: Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you know, business is business. Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. Least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her. Can ya beat that?
ANAKIN: Do you know where they are?
WATTO: Long way from here. someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think.
ANAKIN: I'd like to know. ANAKIN'S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly.
WATTO: Yeah. sure. absolutely. Let's go look in my records. ANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop.
LAMA SU: Tell your Council the first battalions are ready. And remind them that if they need more troops, we will need time to grow I won't forget.
BOBA FETT: JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on. JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT. The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi. JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour. IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN. OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting. IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN. OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as: IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires. OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand. The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand. IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as: OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface. JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform. OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge. Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts. OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared. JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR. OUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where: A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.
PADME: Stay with the ship, Artoo. ARTOO WHISTLES as ANAKIN and PADME start down the trail toward the homestead.
ANAKIN: Oh, my. oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Hello, Threepio.
PADME: Hello, Threepio.
ANAKIN: I've come to see my mother.
PADME: Threepio, what's happened?
ANAKIN: I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here looking for my mother.
OWEN: Owen Lars. I guess I'm your This is my girlfriend, Beru.
BERU: I'm Padme.
PADME: I'm Padme.
OWEN: I had a feeling you might show up some day.
ANAKIN: Is my mother here?
CLIEGG: No, she's not. CLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand.
CLIEGG: ( continuing ) Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife. Come on inside. We have a lot to talk about.
CLIEGG: Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos. From the tracks, she was about halfway when they took her. Those Tuskens walk like men, but they're vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. Three more are still out there looking. I'd be with them, only. I just couldn't ride any more. until I heal. CLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg.
CLIEGG: ( continuing ) This isn't the way I wanted to meet you, son. This isn't how your mother and I planned it. I don't want to give up on her, but she's been gone a month. There's little hope she's lasted this long. Silence. Then ANAKIN stands up.
OWEN: Where are you going?
ANAKIN: To find my mother.
PADME: No, Annie!
CLIEGG: She's daed, son. Accept it.
ANAKIN: I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she's alive. ANAKIN turns abruptly.
ANAKIN: You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padme. You'll be safe.
OWEN: Take my speeder bike.
PADME: PADME hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen's speeder bike, which is standing close by.
ANAKIN: I trust you'll watch over her, Don't worry. ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires.
OWEN: Don't worry. ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires.
ANAKIN: I won't be long. ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADME watches him go.
JANGO FETT: Nearly there, son. JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly:
BOBA FETT: Dad, look!! On the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN.
JANGO FETT: Hang on! The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.
BOBA FETT: Dad! Watch out!
JANGO FETT: Stay calm, son. We'll be fine. That Jedi won't be able to follow us through this. But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them. IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid. IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid.
BOBA FETT: Got him! Yeahhhhh!
JANGO FETT: We won't see him again. BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.
PADME: I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just can't sleep.
PADME: I guess you're lucky.
PADME: You're not happy here?
PADME: Being like what?
PADME: I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
PADME: Maybe we can do something about it.
PADME: Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.
PADME: Let's see, if we put this. Ooooh! That's tickles.
PADME: You'll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold still, please.
ANAKIN: Mom. Mom. Mom. SHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood.
SHMI: Annie.? Is it you? SHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp.
ANAKIN: Im here, Mom. Youre safe. Hang on. Im going to get you out of Im so glad. to see you, Annie. Now. I am complete.
SHMI: Im so glad. to see you, Annie. Now. I am complete.
ANAKIN: Just stay with me, Mom. Im going to make you well again. Everythings going to be fine.
SHMI: You look so handsome. My son. my grown-up son. Im so proud of you, Annie. so proud. I missed you so much. I love. SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms.
BAIL ORGANA: That's outrageous! The treaty forbids the Trade Federation from building up an army. What are they doing?!
PALPATINE: Those Geonosian foundries are part of the Techno Union. We will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions.
YODA: With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be.
MACE WINDU: Our missing apprentice. They are playing their hand at last.
YODA: Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are.
MACE WINDU: Be careful, Obi-Wan. This investigation is becoming less than routine. Do you need help?
BAIL ORGANA: The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war. there can be no doubt of that.
PALPATINE: Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.
MACE WINDU: We must stop them soon before they're fully ready.
BAIL ORGANA: Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The Senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists Mas Amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up.
MAS AMEDDA: This is a crisis! If the Senate votes the Chancellor emergency powers, he could approve the use of the army in a minute.
PALPATINE: Please, please, I don't wish to have emergency powers. That's too extreme a solution. It's akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis? MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.
YODA: Two Hundred,. less or more.
BAIL ORGANA: With all due respect for the Jedi Order, two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids.
MACE WINDU: Patience. We should wait for Obi- Wan to report back. We don't know that Count Dooku has made a treaty with the Corporate Alliance, it's But we must prepare for the worst. I'm going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session. We must not wait!
PALPATINE: Out of the question, Senator! You and I are too closely aligned. The issue will become partisan and debates will begin. The proposal must come from a neutral source.
MAS AMEDDA: If only Senator Amidala were here. JAR JAR steps forward from the back of the group.
JAR JAR: Supreme Chancellor. my august colleagues, I would be proud to propose the motion in question. This is a grave situation, and I'm sure Senator Amidala, and the Queen of Naboo would agree.
PALPATINE: If called upon, I will serve. But it will be the saddest day of my EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - DAY INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY PADME stands back. OWEN is with her. They look at THREEPIO. He isn't the golden figure we know because PADME has had to use whatever stuff she could findin the garage. He is multi-coloured in several textures, but he is complete.
PADME: PADME stands back. OWEN is with her. They look at THREEPIO. He isn't the golden figure we know because PADME has had to use whatever stuff she could findin the garage. He is multi-coloured in several textures, but he is complete.
OWEN: Great! You look perfect.
THREEPIO: ( continuing ) Thank you. He forgets formality and hugs her. PADME hugs him back, laughing.
OWEN: ( grinning ) Well, Padme, I think he should be yours from now on. I know that is what my Mom would want.

PAGE 88: INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY The hologram cuts off. ANAKIN jumps up, agitated.
ANAKIN: I'm going after him!
PADME: I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Yeah, you're right, you're right.
ANAKIN: Yeah, you're right, you're right.
MACE WINDU: We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you, Anakin, is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your priority.
ANAKIN: Understood, Master. The hologram switches off. PADME is looking at the readout on the ship's control panel.
PADME: They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away. PADME starts to hit buttons and flick switches. ANAKIN puts a hand over hers, stopping her. She stares at him.
ANAKIN: If he's still alive.
PADME: Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend. your mentor.
ANAKIN: .He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.
PADME: He gave you strict orders to protect me. PADME pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines fire.
PADME: ( continuing ) .and I'm going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me, you will have to come along. ANAKIN grins and takes the controls.
MACE WINDU: The longer we wait, the stronger Dooku's armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers, in order to be able to use that clone army. We have the authority to go now. We must go now. All of the JEDI COUNCIL nod their approval.
YODA: Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred Jedi send. Enough, let's hope they are.
MAS AMEDDA: Order! Order!! Finally, the uproar dies.
PALPATINE: In the regrettable absence of Senator Amidala, the chair recognises Senior Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar Amid the conflicting storm of CHEERS AND BOOS, JAR JAR, with TWO GUNGAN AIDES, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space. He looks at PALPATINE nervously. PALPATINE nods. JAR JAR clears his throat.
JAR JAR: Senators, dellow felagates. Laughter. Jeers. JAR JAR blushes.
MAS AMEDDA: Order! The Senate will accord the Representative the courtesy of a Comparative quiet. JAR JAR grips the edge of the podium.
JAR JAR: In response to the direct threat to the Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, I propose that the Senate gives immediate emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor. Uproar. JAR JAR looks a little sheepish.
JAR JAR: ( continuing ) Who can deny these are exceptional times? Exceptional times demand exceptional measures! Exceptional measures demand exceptional men!
JAR JAR: That is the sentiment every one of us agrees with! And when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again, the power we now give to the Supreme Chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned. Out ancient liberties will be restored to us, burnished even more brightly than before! Brief silence, then a rolling wave of APPLAUSE. JAR JAR beams and bows. PALPATINE rises.
PALPATINE: It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracy. I love the Republic. The fact that this crisis is demanding I be given absolute power to tule over you is evident. But I am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process. The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated, I promise you. And all I ask in return is when my current term of office is over, you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace.
MAS AMEDDA: We shall proceed to the vote. All those in favor of granting emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor, signal ate at this time. those opposed?
ANAKIN: Hey, where are you going?
PADME: To find Obi-Wan. ANAKIN gets up and goes over to her.
ANAKIN: No! You're not! He grabs her arm.
PADME: Let go of me!
ANAKIN: I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous.
PADMÉ: It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final!
ANAKIN: It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final!
PADMÉ: Don't you give me orders, Annie! I'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man. Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It's up to you. PADME storms out of the cockpit of the Naboo Starfighter. ANAKIN stands scratching his head, then follows. ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.
PADME: ( in a low voice ) It's empty! They start forward. As they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to pulse slowly and move. High above WINGED CREATURES grow from the pillars and detach themselves.
PADME: TWENTY WINGED GEONOSIANS carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in front of them. The GEONOSIANS part, and COUNT DOOKU appears. He bows courteously.
COUNT DOOKU: Senator Amidala, I've heard so much about you.
PADMÉ: Count Dooku, I assume.
COUNT DOOKU: I'm delighted to meet you at last. We have a great deal to discuss, Senator. I hope you can keep your young Jedi under control.
PADMÉ: Don't worry he's housebroken.
PADMÉ: You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi- Wan Kenobi. I am formally requesting you turn him over to me, now.
DOOKU: He has been convicted of espionage, Senator, and will be executed. In just a few hours, I COUNT DOOKU smiles.
PADMÉ: He is an officer of the Republic. You can't do that.
DOOKU: We don't recognise the Republic here, Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance, I could easily hear your plea for clemency. ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on.
PADMÉ: And if I don't join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also die?
DOOKU: I don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will, Senator, but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and I assume you want to do what's in their best interest. Aren't you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't you? Be honest, Senator.
PADMÉ: The ideals are still alive, Count, even if the institution is failing.
DOOKU: You believe in the same ideals we believe in! The same ideals we are striving to make prominent.
PADMÉ: If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right.
DOOKU: The Chancellor means well, M'Lady but he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? Senator, the Republic cannot be fixed. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, a shell game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom.
PADMÉ: I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business. it's business becoming government!
DOOKU: Are you willing to betray your Jedi friends? Without your co-operation I can do nothing to stop their What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?
PADMÉ: What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?
DOOKU: I wouldn't think of such an offence. But, there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, M'lady. It has nothing to do with politics, I'm afraid. It's purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I'm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. I'm sorry but if you are not going to co-operate, I must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice. I've done all I can for you. JANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN.
JANGO FETT: I'll take that weapon. ANAKIN hesitates.
DOOKU: You may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young Jedi, but you will not ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT.
PADMÉ: ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT.
SUN RIT: You have been charged and found guilty of Espionage.
POGGLE: Do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out?
PADMÉ: You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I hope you are prepared for the consequences. POGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles.
POGGLE: We build weapons, Senator. that is our business! Of course we're Get on with it. Carry out the sentence. I want to see her suffer.
NUTE GUNRAY: Get on with it. Carry out the sentence. I want to see her suffer.
POGGLE: Your other Jedi friend is waiting for you, Senator. Take them to the arena! FOUR GUARDS take hold of PADME and ANAKIN. They are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling.
ANAKIN: Don't be afraid.
PADMÉ: I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
ANAKIN: What are you talking about?
PADMÉ: I love you.
ANAKIN: You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives.
PADMÉ: I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. My love for you is a puzzle, Annie, for which I have no answers. I can't control it. and now I don't care. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know. PADME leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for their lips to meet. They kiss.
ANAKIN: I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you. They kiss again. The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena
ANAKIN: I retransmitted it as you requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you.
SUN RIT: The felons before you have been convicted of espionage against the Sovereign System of Geonosis. Their sentence of death is to be carried out in this public arena The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.
POGGLE: Let the executions begin! The crowd goes wild.
ANAKIN: I have a bad feeling about this. From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK ( bull-like ), one is a NEXU ( lion-like ), and one is an ACKLAY ( a kind of dino-lobster ). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter. The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.
ANAKIN: What about Padme? PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.
NUTE GUNRAY: Foul!! She can't do that. shoot her or something! In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.
ANAKIN: You okay?
PADME: ( nods, gasping ) Sure! Well, sort of.
ANAKIN: The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS. In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.
NUTE GUNRAY: This isn't how it's supposed to be! Jango, finish her off. COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.
COUNT DOOKU: ( smiling enigmatically ) Patiece, Viceroy. she will die. Maybe this is the way it's supposed to end. OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.
ARTOO BEEPS: Yes, it has been rather a long time. Do you suppose something's happened to them? ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.
COUNT DOOKU: Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us. You're just in time for the moment of truth. I would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training.
MACE WINDU: Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku. This party's over. MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.
COUNT DOOKU: ( to Mace Windu ) Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi friend. You're impossibly MACE WINDU I don't think so. One Jedi has to be worth a hundred Geonosians. COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.
MACE WINDU: I don't think so. One Jedi has to be worth a hundred Geonosians. COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.
COUNT DOOKU: It wasn't the Geonosians I was thinking about. How well do you think one Jedi will hold up against a thousand battle droids? COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena. MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect. The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.
MACE WINDU: Don't worry! It's being - taken care of!
PLO KOON: We've done it! Now we have a Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.
COUNT DOOKU: Master Windu! You have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in the history archives of the Jedi Order. Now it is finished. Surrender - and your lives will be We will not be hostages for you to barter with Dooku.
COUNT DOOKU: ( continuing ) You have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in the history archives of the Jedi Order. Now it is finished. ( pauses briefly ) Surrender - and your lives will be MACE WINDU We will not be hostages for you to barter with Dooku.
MACE WINDU: We will not be hostages for you to barter with Dooku.
COUNT DOOKU: Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You will have to be destroyed. The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.
PADME: Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.
YODA: Come on - hurry! Hurry! The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.
YODA: More battalions to the left. Encircle them we must, then The CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS wreck the parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance, firing at the massed DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and JEDI fighters.
ANAKIN: It's Dooku, go after him! The PILOT starts to comply, but. there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.
ANAKIN: ( continuing ) ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.
ANAKIN: ( continuing; to pilot ) Put the ship down! Down!
ANAKIN: No we're not!! Land this ship!
ANAKIN: I don't care!.. Go back.
DROID CAPTAIN: Your Excellency! COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.
COUNT DOOKU: That won't be necessary, Captain. Stand down. And leave them to me. The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.
ANAKIN: I'm taking him now!
ANAKIN: You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku. ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN
COUNT DOOKU: Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down.
COUNT DOOKU: Ah, but if I must. COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.
COUNT DOOKU: ( continuing ) I have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the Dark Side. It gives me infinitely greater power.
COUNT DOOKU: Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.
COUNT DOOKU: ( continuing ) Surely you can do better.? ( parries ) No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me? ( cuts ) Which is it? COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.
COUNT DOOKU: ( continuing ) come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery. OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat. COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes. OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor. COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.
COUNT DOOKU: ( continuing ) That's brave of you, boy - but foolish. I would have thought you'd have learnt your lesson.
ANAKIN: I'm a slow learner. And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.
COUNT DOOKU: You have unusual powers, young Padawan. But not enought to save you this time.
ANAKIN: Don't bet on it!
COUNT DOOKU: Master Yoda. At last we shall know who is the most powerful. YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.
YODA: Count Dooku. No interest in contests, do I have. COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower. YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light. Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.
YODA: ( continuing ) The end for you, Count, this is.
COUNT DOOKU: .Not yet. COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates. ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up. YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADMÉ and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.
PADMÉ: PADMÉ runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.
CLONE CAPTAIN: Resistance is at an end, General. What are your orders ? YODA looks at him and sighs.
COUNT DOOKU: The Force is with us, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS: Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have done well.
COUNT DOOKU: I bring you good news, my Lord. The war has begun.
DARTH SIDIOUS: ( smiling ) Everything is going as planned.
MACE WINDU: Where is your apprentice?
YODA: Victory? Victory, you say? OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the Chamber is empty.
YODA: ( continuing ) Not victory, a defeat, it was. Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone War has!
