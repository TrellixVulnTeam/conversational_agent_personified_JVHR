SHERLOCK HOLMES: Written by Michael Robert Johnson, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
MAN: Sherlock Holmes?! My apologies. Send the bill to John Watson, 221B Baker Street.
HOLMES: My apologies. Send the bill to John Watson, 221B Baker Street.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and runs across a courtyard to a side door. WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.
THUG: What's goin' on, John?
HOLMES: Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you work for?
OMITTED: 7 INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - BALCONY - NIGHT 7
ANOTHER ANGLE: Holmes surveys the scene AT A DISTANCE, out of sight. Eyes alive with intelligence, processing angles when A HEAVY HAND falls on his shoulder. PULL BACK to ( The following exchange in whispers. )
HOLMES: Watson. Perfect timing.
WATSON: Nice hat.
HOLMES: Just got it. Where's Lestrade?
WATSON: Getting his troops in formation. Is that your blood or theirs?
HOLMES: I don't know. It's an old shirt.
WATSON: You left this behind.
HOLMES: Knew I'd forgotten something. Thought I'd left the stove on.
WATSON: You did.
HOLMES: Right. Shall we?
ANOTHER ANGLE: The two HARD MEN on guard turn fast and gather together as they hear footsteps approaching.
MAN #1: ( CONTINUED )
WATSON: Yeah, s'me.
WATSON: The girl.
WATSON: Lord Blackwood?!
BLACKWOOD: Well done, Holmes. And Watson as
WATSON: Stay right there. Tell me, doctor, as a medical man, how did you like my work? The fifth one was so scrawny, it was over before I'd finished the first incision.
BLACKWOOD: Tell me, doctor, as a medical man, how did you like my work? The fifth one was so scrawny, it was over before I'd finished the first incision.
HOLMES: Watson struggles forward against Holmes' grip.
HOLMES: ( CONTINUED )
HOLMES: Watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide. INCHES FROM WATSON'S RIGHT EYE is the needle-pointed end of a QUIVERING PIECE OF HIGH-TENSILE WIRE, almost the other end held between Blackwood's hands. A really nasty concealed weapon. One more step and Watson gets impaled in the eye.
BLACKWOOD: What a shame. That would've been
HOLMES: Impeccable timing, Lestrade.
LESTRADE: ( vis Blackwood ) Is that ?
WATSON: It is.
HOLMES: ( re: girl ) We've gone for the doctor. ( re: Blackwood ) And one for the rope.
LESTRADE: You should've waited for my help.
HOLMES: If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor. Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard. I can't imagine why they thought you'd need any assistance.
LESTRADE: What do you make of that?
HOLMES: Some kind of ceremony. Five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon. The double circle's for his own London will breathe a sigh of Scotland Yard. As usual.
LESTRADE: London will breathe a sigh of Scotland Yard. As usual.
WATSON: at the excellent work of Scotland Yard. As usual.
HOLMES: Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar.
OMITTED: 10A INT. LAB 10A
WATSON: 71 over 104. very good, Captain.
CAPTAIN PHILIPS: Me nerves are the best they been in years, thanks to you.
CAPTAIN PHILIPS: Tell me something your new offices. There won't be so many stairs, I hope?
WATSON: No ground floor. And there'll be a woman's touch, too.
WATSON: Let's give it a little longer, just to be safe. I'll be right back.
MRS. HUDSON: ( panting ) I won't go in there by myself, not while he's in this state.
WATSON: You're not going in at all.
MRS. HUDSON: What will I do when you leave? He'll burn the house down around me. What will he do? Couldn't you have a longer engagement?
WATSON: He just needs a new case, that's
WATSON: I smell burning.
WATSON: Why don't you take Captain Philips and give him a nice cup of tea.
MRS. HUDSON: Come on, Captain, let's go down. It'll be quieter.
WATSON: ( as they leave ) And perhaps some tea and bread up here when you can.
WATSON: May I join you in the armory?
HOLMES: Please. Watson, I've been working on a device which will suppress the sound of a gunshot.
HOLMES: Please. Don't, don't, don't. It needs work. May I see?.
WATSON: It needs work. May I see?.
HOLMES: Gently, gently, Watson. It's been three months since the last case. About time you found another one.
WATSON: It's been three months since the last case. About time you found another one.
HOLMES: I can't but agree. My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work. The sooner the
WATSON: Watson hands Holmes the newspaper.
WATSON: Let's see, we have a letter here from Mrs. Ramsey in Queen's Park her husband has gone missing.
HOLMES: He's in Belgium with the scullery maid. Is it December?
WATSON: Yes, Holmes. Lady Radford reports a missing emerald bracelet.
HOLMES: Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging.
WATSON: Yes, it's our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end.
WATSON: Mr. Lewis is seeking.
HOLMES: ( to Watson ) There is only one case that intrigues me at present. the curious case of Mrs. Hudson, the absentee landlady.
MRS. HUDSON: Tea, Mr. Holmes. Is it poisoned, nanny?
HOLMES: Is it poisoned, nanny?
MRS. HUDSON: There's enough of that in you
HOLMES: Don't touch that. Everything is in its proper place, as per usual.
MRS. HUDSON: He's killed the dog. again.
WATSON: What have you done to Gladstone this time?
HOLMES: I was simply testing a new anesthetic. He doesn't mind.
WATSON: Holmes! As your doctor.
HOLMES: He'll be right as a trivet in no
WATSON: . and your friend, you've been in this room for two weeks. I insist you get out of here.
HOLMES: There's nothing of interest to me out there, on earth, at all.
WATSON: So, you have nothing to do?
HOLMES: Then you're free this evening.
WATSON: Then you're free this evening.
HOLMES: For dinner.
WATSON: For dinner.
HOLMES: The Royale.
WATSON: The Royale.
HOLMES: My favorite.
WATSON: Mary's coming.
HOLMES: Not available.
WATSON: You're meeting her, Holmes.
HOLMES: Have you proposed yet?
WATSON: I'm still looking for the right
HOLMES: Then it's not official.
WATSON: It's happening, like it or not. Half past eight. The Royale.
WATSON: And wear a jacket.
WATSON: Holmes! You're early.
HOLMES: May I present Miss Mary Morstan.
WATSON: May I present Miss Mary Morstan.
HOLMES: My pleasure. For the life of me I don't know why it's taken him so long to get us properly
MARY: The pleasure's mine. It really is a thrill to meet you, Mr. Holmes.
WATSON: ( proudly ) It's true.
MARY: They can seem a bit far-fetched sometimes, though. Making these grand assumptions out of tiny Oh, no no. The little details are by far the most important. Take I intend to.
HOLMES: ( livening up ) Oh, no no. The little details are by far the most important. Take I intend to.
MARY: I intend to.
HOLMES: . see that walking-stick? A rare African snakewood hiding a blade of high-tensile steel. A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war, so I can assume he's a decorated soldier. Strong, brave, born to be a man of action. And neat, like all military men. Then I check his pockets. ah. A stub from a boxing match. Now I can infer he's a bit of a gambler. I'd keep an eye on that, by the Those days are behind me.
WATSON: Those days are behind me.
HOLMES: Yes, right behind you. He's cost us the rent more than
MARY: With all due respect, Mr. Holmes, you know him. But what about a perfect stranger? What can you tell about me?
WATSON: I don't think that's necessary
HOLMES: Yes, I doubt
MARY: No, it'd be wonderful. I insist.
HOLMES: You insist? She insisted. You're a governess.
MARY: Well done.
WATSON: Yes, well done. So shall we
HOLMES: Your student's a boy of 8.
MARY: Charlie's 7, actually.
HOLMES: It's breathing. Then he's tall for his age.
HOLMES: He flicked ink at you today.
MARY: Is there ink on my face?
WATSON: There's nothing wrong with your The gentleman has already ordered for himself. What would madam care for this
WAITER: The gentleman has already ordered for himself. What would madam care for this
WATSON: Give us a few minutes, please.
HOLMES: There are two drops on your ear. India blue's nearly impossible to wash off, anyway. A very impetuous act by the boy, but you're too experienced to react rashly which is why the lady you work for lent you that necklace. It's from Asprey's, flawless, not the gems of a However, the jewels you're not wearing tell us rather more.
WATSON: Both Watson and Mary scorch Holmes with their eyes. Holmes pauses. pauses, then:
HOLMES: You were engaged.
HOLMES: The ring is gone. But the lighter skin where it sat suggests you spent some time abroad wearing it
HOLMES: Or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to England for better prospects. A doctor perhaps.
MARY: ( low ) Right on all counts but one. I didn't leave my fiance. he died.
WATSON: Well done, old man.
HOLMES: She's lovely.
HOLMES' POV: Happy couples eating, laughing, talking. Suddenly, Holmes hears no words. He just sees their mouths moving. The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine china rises to an ORCHESTRAL ROAR which becomes the ROAR of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB as a fist smashes into a face with a MEATY THUD.
NIGHT: Holmes staggers back from the blow. He tastes his own blood from a split lip. It interests him. He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. His opponent, McMURDO huge but flabby bangs his fists together and moves in. Bets rage back and forth through the pressing CROWD.
HOLMES' POV: The room and the fight are calm the sounds muffled and indistinct a complete sensory reversal of his experience in the restaurant. This is soothing to him, the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing.
HOLMES: Well done. Thank you. Oi! We ain't done here.
HOLMES: ( walking away ) Not done. Finished. And as I said, thank you, it was most Hm. Plymouth gin.
HOLMES: Hm. Plymouth gin.
GUARD CAPTAIN: Charlie, what the hell's going on down here?
CHARLIE: It's Jack, he tried to stop Blackwood from doing his spells. And now he's in some kind of fit.
GUARD CAPTAIN: ( to the prisoners in You lot shut it! ( to the guards ) Charlie, get, down here and get him to the infirmary.
GUARD CAPTAIN: All right, Blackwood, what's this all about?
BLACKWOOD: I've a request.
GUARD CAPTAIN: You don't get nothin' `til you stop this devil nonsense. That's a holy book
GUARD CAPTAIN: ( louder ) and you will respect it!
GUARD CAPTAIN: Boy, you want me to muzzle you
GUARD #2: Get him to the infirmary, now!
BLACKWOOD: I've a request.
WATSON: You know this is for eye surgery?
HOLMES: I find that it lifts my spirits.
WATSON: It's a pathological amorbic process, it increases tissue change and weakness. And you know what a black reaction comes on you
HOLMES: Look at this. If you play a chromatic scale, they move clockwise. As soon as you switch to a pentatonic scale
WATSON: ( faking interest ) Really? What about when you
WATSON: Let's go. Lestrade wants you at Pentonville Prison.
HOLMES: That's your job, not mine.
WATSON: You're Blackwood's last request. Says he has information he'll give only to you.
HOLMES: Look at that structure. What has it been? Five years' work already? Are you aware that is the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge. Very
HOLMES: Oh, I have your cut from last night, by the way. You weren't there so I laid your customary
HOLMES: You're right. I'll keep it with your check book, locked safely away in my drawer.
HOLMES: The opera house is featuring Don Giovanni and I could easily procure two tickets if you had some cultural inclination this You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
HOLMES: You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
WATSON: And your grand gift is the uncanny ability to demoralize people. I was aware she'd been engaged. She told me.
HOLMES: So that's a `no' to the opera
WATSON: That's my waistcoat.
HOLMES: It's too small for you.
WATSON: Well, it's my property and I want it back.
WATSON: You go ahead. I've no business with him while he's alive.
HOLMES: Where are all the other prisoners?
GUARD: We had to move `em, sir, otherwise we were going to have a riot on our hands. There's something about him. it's like he can get inside your head.
HOLMES: I'm sure I can find my own way from here, if you have other duties to attend to.
GUARD: Much obliged, sir. Thank you, thank you.
BLACKWOOD: QUOTE from Revelations tbd. Love what you've done with the Thank you for joining me.
HOLMES: Love what you've done with the Thank you for joining me.
BLACKWOOD: Thank you for joining me.
HOLMES: A small point of concern.
BLACKWOOD: How can I help?
HOLMES: I'd already followed the murders with some interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims, I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush
BLACKWOOD: You're too kind.
HOLMES: However, by comparison, your work in the crypt was akin to a finger So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot, and that's why you're really here.
BLACKWOOD: So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot, and that's why you're really here.
HOLMES: Actually, my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and I thought I might keep him company.
BLACKWOOD: Allow me to enlighten you. Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly has led to this moment. Your error in judgement is to assume I've been holding the brush at all I am merely the
HOLMES: My only wish is that I'd caught you earlier. I might have spared five lives.
BLACKWOOD: Those lives were a necessity, a sacrifice. Five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose.
HOLMES: I wonder if they'd let Watson and I dissect your brain after you're hanged, of course. I'd wager there's some deformity that would be scientifically significant. Then you would serve a greater purpose, too.
BLACKWOOD: Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze. I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events. For you and I are bound on a journey that will twist the very fabric of nature. I sense fragility beneath your mask of logic, and it worries me. Steel your mind, Holmes, I need
HOLMES: I must say, you've come a long way down from the House of Lords.
BLACKWOOD: But I will rise again.
HOLMES: Bon voyage, Blackwood.
BLACKWOOD: Pay attention! Three more shall die, and there is nothing you can do to save them.
LESTRADE: What did he want?
HOLMES: Holmes looks at the priest.
HOLMES: Don't think you're needed, Father. Not for this one.
BLACKWOOD: Death is only the beginning.
IRENE: Not that I'm pining for New
IRENE: I prefer to travel in the winter.
IRENE: I brought a few souvenirs. Dates from Jordan, tea from Ceylon and olives from Cyclades. I thought we'd have a little tea party to cheer us up.
IRENE: I came across this as I was setting up.
IRENE: Theft of Velasquez portrait from the King of Spain. Missing naval documents lead to resignation of Bulgarian Prime Minister. Scandalous affair ends engagement of Hapsburg Prince to Romanov
HOLMES: Simply studying your methodology for when the authorities ask me to hunt you down.
IRENE: I don't see my name anywhere.
HOLMES: But your signature is clear.
HOLMES: Ah, the Maharajah's missing diamond. Another souvenir?
IRENE: He has a palace full of them. Let's not dwell on the past.
IRENE: By the looks of things you're between cases at the moment.
HOLMES: And you, husbands. No ring?
IRENE: He snored. I'm Irene Adler again and I need your help to find someone. There's nobody more brilliant or who knows London better than you. Plus, it's a wonderful opportunity to see you
IRENE: Why are you so suspicious?
HOLMES: Should I answer chronologically or
IRENE: This is all the information you
HOLMES: Who are you working for?
IRENE: I'm my own man.
HOLMES: Keep your money. I didn't say I'd take the case.
IRENE: They gave me our old room.
IRENE: Hello, John.
IRENE: emerges from the alley holding a lovely bunch of roses. She sniffs them appreciatively, walks on.
IRENE: approaches a waiting carriage, looks around her, gets in.
MORIARTY: I assume he'll do it?
IRENE: Not for money, but for me. I wager he'll find our man within twenty-four hours.
MORIARTY: You wager?
IRENE: I'm certain.
MORIARTY: A better word. I sincerely hope it's accurate.
IRENE: Suddenly, the coach comes to a halt, they lurch forward.
I: Suddenly, the coach comes to a halt, they lurch forward.
BEGGAR: Ow, me leg!
COACH DRIVER: Get out of it!
BEGGAR: You run me over, sir, yes you did!
COACH DRIVER: You fell right into the carriage! A little charity would go a long way, yes it would, sir.
BEGGAR: A little charity would go a long way, yes it would, sir.
WATSON: Look at you, I can't believe you ran after her like a schoolboy again. Leaping about, all aflutter. Are you a masochist?
HOLMES: Allow me to explain.
WATSON: Don't you remember what she did to you? She turned you inside out, she made a proper idiot of you. I'm sorry, you were going to explain something.
HOLMES: Thank you, I
WATSON: I know, instead of just being tricked into being a witness at her wedding like last time
HOLMES: I don't believe
WATSON: You dress up as clergyman and actually perform the ceremony. She'd love that.
HOLMES: You've had your fun.
WATSON: What's she after, anyway?
HOLMES: Now it's time to press on.
HOLMES: Now it's time to press on.
WATSON: Go on. I won't interrupt.
HOLMES: It doesn't matter
WATSON: What could she possibly need? An alibi, a beard, a human canoe. She can sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames.
HOLMES: Regrettably, we've had our last case together. Those are my I've already read it. Luke Reordon, four foot ten, red hair, missing two front teeth.
WATSON: I've already read it. Luke Reordon, four foot ten, red hair, missing two front teeth.
WATSON: Case solved! You're just not her type, Holmes. She likes ginger So you agree?
HOLMES: So you agree?
WATSON: So you agree?
HOLMES: No, I don't agree. It's more than a technicality. You're misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened people.
WATSON: I've upset you, I can tell. I've said too much.
HOLMES: No, I'm just saying, one has disproportionate limbs the other does not.
WATSON: Alright. What were you just Will you allow me to explain.
HOLMES: Will you allow me to explain.
WATSON: That's what I've been trying to
IRENE: Why don't I see myself out.
IRENE: Oh, how nice of you.
IRENE: Oh, look, a wallet. Doesn't look like yours, does it? And naughty boy here's another one. I'll return them, shall I?
IRENE: These are lovely, thank you.
HOLMES: Now, that's the Irene I know.
HOLMES: This man intrigues me, Watson. He's got Adler on edge.
WATSON: Which is no mean feat.
HOLMES: She's intimidated, scared.
WATSON: And yet she works for him. That's bad money. It's nothing to do with me, but leave this case.
HOLMES: Well, I may not have a choice. A man has to make a living. After all, I'll be paying the rent entirely on my own.
WATSON: You know what, I've had just about Mister Holmes, sir.?
HOLMES: VOICE ( O.S. )
CONSTABLE CLARK: Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me, at once.
HOLMES: ( mumbles ) What's he done now, lost his way to Scotland Yard? Watson, grab a compass. You means us.
WATSON: Us means you.
CONSTABLE CLARK: It's Lord Blackwood, sir. It appears he's come back from the Well that's clever seeing as how I pronounced him dead myself.
WATSON: Well that's clever seeing as how I pronounced him dead myself.
CONSTABLE CLARK: A groundsman saw him walking through the graves, just this I'll leave this one in your capable hands. I have tea with Mary and her parents this evening.
WATSON: I'll leave this one in your capable hands. I have tea with Mary and her parents this evening.
HOLMES: It is not my reputation at stake Are you taking this seriously?
WATSON: Are you taking this seriously?
HOLMES: Like it or not, it's a matter of professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.
HOLMES: Watson, you'd do well to hide your medical certificates in case they're revoked.
WATSON: Look at this mess. Nothing but standard-issue police bootprints. Any possible evidence there might have been has been trampled.
HOLMES: Scotland Yard at their finest, once again.
LESTRADE: Look at those slabs of marble they're half a ton each if they're a pound smashed outward like they were nothing. Explain it if you can, Holmes.
LESTRADE: Explain it if you can, Holmes.
HOLMES: And the coffin?
LESTRADE: We're digging it up now. The witness is over there. You can question him if you like but you won't get much.
LESTRADE: ( low, angry ) If you lot don't stop behaving like a bunch of superstitious milk maids, you're on double-time! You're an embarrassment! Also, you're forbidden to talk about this to anyone, not a word. Are we bloody clear on that?
THE GROUNDSKEEPER: mumbles the Lord's Prayer under his breath. Watson immediately goes into doctor mode checking his pulse, looking in his eyes. The Groundskeeper just keeps praying. Watson takes a boiled sweet from his pocket, pops it in the man's mouth and gently sits him down. Holmes walks over holding a small branch from a tree.
WATSON: He's in shock. We should give him a few moments.
LESTRADE: The witness stated that he saw Lord Blackwood rise from the Well? You pronounced the man He had no pulse.
WATSON: ( stung ) He had no pulse.
HOLMES: Inspector, do you know if this is a spruce or a sycamore? OPEN IT!!
LESTRADE: OPEN IT!!
OPEN IT!!: ( CONTINUED )
LESTRADE: That's not Blackwood.
HOLMES: Now that we have a firm grasp of the obvious.
WATSON: Lividity is late stage. Diptera deposits are approximately three quarters of an inch, putting the time of death at ten to twelve hours ago.
HOLMES: Inspector, may I see your pen?
WATSON: Missing two incisors in the upper Adler's midget.
HOLMES: All yours, Inspector.
HOLMES: Scratches around the keyhole where the watch is wound. Most drunks are the same, and pawnbrokers scratch the ticket number and their initials inside the lid. This one has five, so the owner
GROUNDSKEEPER: ( quivering voice ) He was walking but his feet didn't touch the ground. And I'm not daft, I know what I saw and I know Lord Blackwood. He was as alive as you or me. It's not right. It's not natural. ( turns, leaves ) Our Father Who art in heaven. ( etc. )
HOLMES: Now the game is afoot, Watson.
WATSON: I fail to see how these fish and chips are different from the three other places we passed along the Trust me.
HOLMES: Trust me.
WATSON: Just eat.
WATSON: You know, I've seen things in war that I couldn't explain. I once heard a man predict his death, down to the number and placement of the bullet holes that killed him. You have to admit that a supernatural explanation is at least theoretically possible.
HOLMES: ( mouth full, near Never theorize before you have data. Invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. Adler's midget is the key to this. Hmm. scratches around the keyhole, what does that tell you?
HOLMES: Hmm. scratches around the keyhole, what does that tell you?
WATSON: The owner was most likely a drunk. Each time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the Very good, Watson! You've developed considerable powers of your own.
HOLMES: Very good, Watson! You've developed considerable powers of your own.
HOLMES: Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored into the Pawnbroker's marks.
WATSON: Pawnbroker's marks.
HOLMES: Watson looks extremely pleased with himself until they turn a corner into a street where EVERY SECOND SHOP IS A PAWN SHOP. His face falls.
HOLMES: The most recent is M.H.
WATSON: Maddison and Haig.
HOLMES: Oh my Lord, here we are. They should give us an address.
WATSON: There's one thing you've missed. On the watch.
HOLMES: I think not.
WATSON: The time. Which leads me to deduce that I'm already late for my appointment with Mary. You remember, the one I was leaving for before you talked me into coming to dig up dead bodies with Reckon your future, sir?
PALM READER: Reckon your future, sir?
HOLMES: Perhaps we do need a little help from the beyond.
WATSON: No, thank you.
PALM READER: You need to hear what I have to tell you.
PALM READER: I see two men, brothers. Not in blood but in bond. I see the letters S and an L, no. wait, a
PALM READER: ( wincing ) I see madness. A man driven out of his mind by a malign force.
PALM READER: I see a letter. the letter M. another M. Mary? You will be married. I see. I see. Patterned table clothes, china figurines, lace doilies.
WATSON: You think you are clever don't
PALM READER: She turns to fat.
WATSON: The Palm Reader looks at Holmes.
HOLMES: ( to Watson ) Do you have any changes?
WATSON: This is a new low even for you.
HOLMES: It's the most honest prediction old Flora has made in years. And you know it yourself, Watson. That is precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring. You're terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre, as well you should be.
WATSON: Do you still have my cut from the
HOLMES: Why, do you
PALM READER: I seen something in his hand. Darkness and great pain. Mortal peril. Warn your friend, he's not
WATSON: Not bad, eh?
HOLMES: Reordon's lodgings should be right around this bend. Here we are.
HOLMES: Looks promising. And possibly dangerous. Oh, well, give my regards to Mary.
WATSON: I can spare ten minutes.
HOLMES: He clearly felt something was coming to get him.
WATSON: Something did.
WATSON: ( reeling ) Bloody hell.
HOLMES: ( inhaling deeply, Ammonium sulfate.
HOLMES: ( mumbles ) Phosphorous. Formaldehyde. Appears he was attempting to follow occult formula with scientific practice.
WATSON: Appears he was attempting to follow occult formula with scientific practice.
WATSON: Has he any hydrochloric acid?

HOLMES: Maybe it's not the man she's after, but something else. Something he was working on?
WATSON: Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron right out of the ink. Long as it's not too burnt.
WATSON: He worked for Blackwood.
HOLMES: There's one odor I can't put my finger on. Sweet, almost like perfume. or sugar.. Barley sugar.
HOLMES: Hello, gentlemen.
DREDGER: Sherlock Holmes.
HOLMES: Let me guess you're here to extinguish any connection between the man who lived here and the man you work for? Curious you'd still be running errands for a dead man.
DREDGER: ( smiles ) You do like to talk.
HOLMES: You take them, I'll handle Mr. Sweet tooth.
WATSON: Seems about fair.

EXPLODE BACKWARDS: the PROPELLERS on the stern of the ship start sliding down towards them.
WATSON: I haven't slept all night. I deserve this. I clearly deserve it. How could I ever be so deluded as to believe I could meet Mary's parents for tea once I let myself be talked into going with you. Now of course I'm in jail. You're not implying that I am responsible for our current situation are you, Watson? We were set upon, man, it was self-

HOLMES: You've never complained about my methods before.
WATSON: I'm not complaining. I never complain. I never complain about your violin playing at three in the morning, your mess, your lack of hygiene, your stealing my clothes, your setting our home on That was an accident.
HOLMES: That was an accident.
HOLMES: The first time WAS an accident.
HOLMES: Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth most dangerous man in London.
WATSON: Who could forget that face? I told you, a little nitrate of silver and the warts will be gone in two weeks. Now, if you'll excuse us!
WATSON: ( to Holmes ) Nor am I complaining about the fact that you terrorize my patients and perform outlandish experiments on my dog.
HOLMES: Gladstone's my dog as well. It's in the interest of science.
WATSON: What I do take issue with is your ruthless campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary.
HOLMES: Watson, I completely understand now. You're overtired and feeling a bit sensitive.

ANONYMOUS MAN: I'm afraid you'll have to put this
SIR THOMAS: Mr. Holmes, apologies for summoning you like this. I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are, and who I am.
HOLMES: As to where I am I was, admittedly, lost for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn. But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill, the only bakers to use a certain French glaze on their loaves. After that, the carriage forked left, then right, a bump over the Fleet conduit need I go on?
HOLMES: As to who you are that took every ounce of my not- inconsiderable experience and skill. the letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice. That would be your official title. Who you realy are is another matter entirely.
HOLMES: Judging by the sacred Ox on your ring, you're also the secret head of the Temple of the Four Orders in whose headquarters we now stand, on the northwest corner of St. James Square. And as to the mystery the mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me in the first place.
SIR THOMAS: Yes, well, it's standard procedure, I suppose.
SIR THOMAS: Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador Standish from America and Lord Coward, the Home Secretary.
LORD COWARD: I suppose you already have some notion as to the practices of our Order?
HOLMES: Yes. They're almost interesting.
SIR THOMAS: Be as skeptical as you like but our secret systems have steered the world towards the greater good for centuries. The danger is that they can also be exploited for more nefarious purposes.
LORD COWARD: What some call the dark arts, or practical magic.
STANDISH: We know you're are a rationalist. We don't ask you to share our faith, only our fears.

LORD COWARD: His power grows daily and exponentially. His resurrection is evidence of that. What he does next will be far more dangerous
SIR THOMAS: he's going to raise a force that will alter the very course of our world. We need you to find him and stop him before he does.
LORD COWARD: We'll give you any assistance we can. As Home Secretary, I have considerable influence over the Name your price.
HOLMES: One of the great benefits of my work is that I can pick and choose my clients. I'll get him, but not for you.

SIR THOMAS: What is it?

They will certainly consider your reticence to be an obstruction of justice. Which in relation to a crime of this magnitude would certainly mean prison time.

HOLMES: Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose.

HOLMES: I need a map of London.
HOLMES: Now that you're sitting comfortably, I shall begin. My initial approach was far too narrow. When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville prison, he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum, I have done just that. In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity. But that's for another time. Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed by The Temple of the Four Orders for centuries. To fully understand this system, to get inside it, I re-enacted the ceremony we interrupted in the crypt. with a few enhancements of my own.
WATSON: At minimum.
HOLMES: My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended.

OMITTED: 118 INT. SEWER JUNCTION - DAY 118
IRENE: That was something new for us.
HOLMES: Yes. it was.
IRENE: ( CONTINUED )
WATSON: I'm pretty sure I heard the last
HOLMES: Yes, we made it. Just.
HOLMES: Come on, you've got to admit, you're going to miss this.
WATSON: Which part? The stench of the sewers or the broken bones? My ankle's done.
WATSON: Where's Irene?
WATSON: Holmes, I'm sorry.
HOLMES: Make sure Lestrade keeps it
DAY: OF IRENE at the top of TOWER BRIDGE. She's climbed up the inside of the Tower. She's 250 feet above the We've gone straight from maximum claustrophobia to maximum knee-buckling exposure. PULL BACK and SWEEP INTO a massive, NEAR 360-DEGREE HELICOPTER SHOT that starts with Irene at the ( unfinished ) window then shows the skeletal bridge spanned tenuously with then the glory of London, the center of the world, laid out for us in breathtaking, spectacular beauty and returns to Irene as, recovered somewhat she darts onto the walkway scaffolding that crosses above the 119-119G OMITTED 119-119G 119H EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - WALKWAY - DAY 119H Irene works her way through the construction debris on the bridge. She makes it to the end, no further to go.
SHERLOCK: Sherlock appears behind her, winded.
SHERLOCK: It's bad manners to leave without at least saying `goodbye.'
IRENE: He start to move towards her. She whips out her gun.
IRENE: You of all people know I will pull this trigger.
IRENE: I'd tell you I'm sorry, that I wish things could be different but you wouldn't believe me anyway.
HOLMES: Why hurry off, give it a try.
BLACKWOOD: You're better off without her,
BLACKWOOD: I planned to kill a handful of senile old men to make this empire strong. but now because of you thousands are going to die.
BLACKWOOD: All I have to do is break this cylinder. The wind will do the rest. And you'll be the first.
HOLMES: There was never any magic. Only conjuring tricks.
HOLMES: The simplest involved paying people off, like the prison
HOLMES: ( guard choking/ Who pretended to be possessed outside your cell. Your reputation and your jailers' fear did the rest. ( burial ground/ Others required more elaborate preparation, like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb. You had it broken before your burial then put back together using a mild adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe I believe a mixture of egg and honey. Designed to be washed away by the rain or eaten by animals. ( bath/Reordon Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub required more modern science. Very clever of Reordon to find a paralytic that was activated by the combination of copper and water and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained.
HOLMES: You hated your father and the other members of the Temple of the Four Orders for what they did to you. How satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them.
BLACKWOOD: Cut me loose, Holmes!
HOLMES: You better hope that it's nothing more than superstition as you performed all the rituals
HOLMES: First, the world will see you for what you are. Then you will hang. properly this time.
BLACKWOOD: We'll see about that shall we. It's a long journey from here to the rope.
HOLMES: We'll see about that shall we.
HOLMES: Oh, Irene.
IRENE: It looks like rain.
HOLMES: We've still got a moment.
IRENE: You were right, he is a professor. Moriarty. Key's in the watch
IRENE: You'll miss me, Sherlock.
HOLMES: Sadly, yes.
LESTRADE: It'll be a hell of a trick if Blackwood comes back from this Thank you, Lestrade.
HOLMES: Thank you, Lestrade.
LESTRADE: Now you're going to be even more arrogant and insufferable than
LESTRADE: You're welcome, detective. Is the woman up there?
HOLMES: She won't be by the time your boys get there.
WATSON: One moment.
WATSON: Please make sure this one is put on the desk in the front room.
MARY: What's in all those notebooks?
WATSON: Nothing really. Just a few scribbles. cases we've worked on over the years.
MARY: All your adventures. I'd love to read them sometime.
WATSON: I still can't believe he's given us that ring.
MARY: Do you think he's finally come to terms with you leaving?
WATSON: Of course. No question about it
WATSON: Don't panic, dear.
WATSON: Suicide is not in his repetoire, he's far too fond of himself.
HOLMES: Good afternoon. I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution. Clearing your good name, as it were. But it had a surprisingly soporific effect and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus, like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
WATSON: Get on with it, Holmes.
HOLMES: Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook I believe my legs have fallen asleep. I should probably come Shouldn't you help him, John?
MARY: Shouldn't you help him, John?
WATSON: I hate to stop when he's on a roll. Do carry on, Holmes.
HOLMES: The executioner attached it to a harness, thus allowing the weight to be distributed around the waist and the neck to remain intact. My lord, I can't feel my cheeks. Might we continue this at ground How did you manage it, Holmes?
WATSON: How did you manage it, Holmes?
HOLMES: I managed it with braces, belts and a coat hook. Please, Watson, my tongue is going next. I'll be of no use to you at all.
WATSON: Worse things could happen.
MARY: Watson draws his sword.
WATSON: But none of this explains the lack of a pulse.
HOLMES: There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum. It is quite infamous in the region of Turkey bordering the Black Sea for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis. Enough to mislead a medical mind even as tenacious and well-trained as your own. It is known locally as
MARY: What's wrong with Gladstone?
HOLMES: mad honey disease.
HOLMES: He is demonstrating the very effect I've just described. He doesn't mind.
WATSON: His heart should be ticking in no
CONSTABLE CLARK: Mr. Holmes. Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me, right What is it this time, Clarky?
HOLMES: What is it this time, Clarky?
CONSTABLE CLARK: It's one of our sergeants, sir. He went missing in the sewers, the day you stopped Lord Blackwood. Well, a maintenance man found his body this morning. We believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene. Shot in the head.
HOLMES: Were there powder burns on his
CONSTABLE CLARK: Point blank range.
WATSON: Point blank range.
HOLMES: With small caliber bullet.
CONSTABLE CLARK: Holmes and Watson look at each other complete change of demeanor mind racing, looking concerned. The dog has regained its vital signs.
HOLMES: Holmes and Watson look at each other complete change of demeanor mind racing, looking concerned. The dog has regained its vital signs.
MARY: There's a brave boy. There, there, everything's going to be all right.
WATSON: Where is Blackwood's device now?
CONSTABLE CLARK: The secret service has it, sir. They've taken over the case.
HOLMES: I'd wager there's a piece missing.
WATSON: So you're saying Moriarty was after a part of the machine and not the poison.
HOLMES: The wire-free invention was the game all along. Imagine being able to control any device simply by sending a command via radio Adler was just a diversion.
WATSON: Adler was just a diversion.
DRIVER: ( to Watson ) I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.
WATSON: I'll leave with you. Clarky, case
HOLMES: I'll leave with you. Clarky, case

HOLMES: Were there powder burns on his
CONSTABLE CLARK: He was shot at point-blank range.
WATSON: There's a brave boy. There, there, everything's going to be all right.
HOLMES: Where is Blackwood's device now?
CONSTABLE CLARK: The secret service has it, sir. They've taken over the case.
WATSON: I'd wager there's a piece missing.
HOLMES: Wager, Watson. I thought those days were behind you. Excellent deduction, however.
WATSON: Moriarty was after the machine not the poison.
HOLMES: Blackwood's wire-free invention was the game all along. It is undoubtedly the more dangerous and the more valuable of the two. Irene was just a diversion.
MAN: ( to Watson ) I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.
WATSON: I'll walk out with you.
HOLMES: I'll walk out with you.
HOLMES: An honor working with you, Doctor.
WATSON: Take care of yourself, Holmes.
MARY: Try not to be too late for dinner with my parents and. be careful.
HOLMES: Magnificent woman, Watson.
