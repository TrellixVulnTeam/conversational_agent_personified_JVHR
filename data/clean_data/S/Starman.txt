"STARMAN": Screenplay by with Dean Riesner ( uncredited )
DRAFT SCRIPT: FADE IN: EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT The wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very faintly through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue rack lights of a police car coming toward us. It drops into a dip, reappears almost immediately, hurtling down the center of the deserted highway. It gets closer and closer until the lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us.
GUARD: ( an edge of fear in his voice ) It's coming up. Slow down. ( he points out between them ) There, right there.
OFFICER: ( startled ) Benny, God, take it easy.
SECOND OFFICER: Smells smoke.
BENNY: I told you.
BENNY: ( loud whisper ) There!! Up on the hill!!
BENNY: Right in line with that burning tree.
OFFICER: I don't see anything.
BENNY: It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
OFFICER: Benny, there's nothing there.
BENNY: There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the Flew?! Oh, come on Benny.
OFFICER: Flew?! Oh, come on Benny.
OFFICER: You hear that, Mike? Now he's telling What's that? What did I tell you?
BENNY: What did I tell you?
OFFICER: Probably kids.
MIKE: ( not convinced )
BENNY: Don't you think you should call a No, we can handle this.
OFFICER: No, we can handle this.
OFFICER: ( over outside speakers ) This is the police. Identify
BENNY: ( to the officers, his voice cracking ) There's one over here.
BENNY: Stop!! Police!!
MIKE: ( in Benny's direction ) What happened?
BENNY: I think I shot one.
MIKE: Jesus, Benny. What are you doing?
OFFICER: You see anything, Mike?
OFFICER: This is the police. Identify
BENNY: ( shouts to the officers ) You wanna give me some help over
MIKE: Benny continues around the house. He flashes his light into a doorway. There is nothing but framing. When he moves on, a figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space, then raises its arms. With a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing off its wrist into its hands. At the corner of the house Benny hears the snap and stops. The high pitched whistle starts behind him. He stumbles around to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him. Benny screams in terror and fires at it. The light swerves and a laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears Benny's chest and knocks him to the ground in pain. Holding his shoulder he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the The officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the air, then crashes to the earth.
OFFICER: Mike, call for back-up. Benny, you all right?
BENNY: I don't think so.
OFFICER: ( waving the beam of his flashlight, shouts ) Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.
BENNY: Don't leave me. I'm coming.
SUBTITLE: Lander four to Mapmaker Wind. Fix position for rescue. Repeat. Fix position for rescue.
PARTNER: What the hell was it anyway?
DRIVER: Damned if I know.
MAN: ( around a cigarette ) Major Aaron Bell.
SHERMIN: Marc Shermin, National Security
SHERMIN: This has always been my favorite time of day.
SHERMIN: Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
MAJOR BELL: Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
SHERMIN: Can you see under the faceplate?
MAJOR BELL: Bell's hands shake as he lights a new cigarette off the one in his mouth.
SHERMIN: There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then.
MAJOR BELL: Wait'll you see it. We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
MAJOR BELL: We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
SHERMIN: Was there visual contact?
MAJOR BELL: No, sir. Radar.
SHERMIN: It could have been anything.
MAJOR BELL: After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship. It might be alive.
SHERMIN: People have made mistakes in these situations before.
MAJOR BELL: I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
MAJOR BELL: Look at the hands.
SHERMIN: Oh, Jesus.
MAJOR BELL: ( moving toward the body ) We better get it into the box. Come
SUBTITLE: Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?
SHERMIN: ( incredulous ) The other one is alive!
STAR MAN: ( subtitle ) Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?
STAR MAN: Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?
STAR MAN: Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?
LYMAN: Is it for real?
SHERMIN: Get Fox.
SHERMIN: ( before Fox can speak ) It's real, George.
FOX: There's no mistake? You're absolutely I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and.
SHERMIN: I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and.
FOX: Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
SHERMIN: None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva.
FOX: Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there. We didn't expect this, Neither did I.
SHERMIN: ( answering the accusation ) Neither did I.
FOX: We're going. Damn! We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
MAJOR BELL: Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
FOX: ( ignores this ) Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
SHERMIN: We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
FOX: I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
SHERMIN: Wait, wait. What are my orders if we find this thing?
FOX: Contain it and get back to me.
SHERMIN: What do you mean by 'contain?'
FOX: Just what I said.
VOICES: It was great to have you back. The kids loved it. We loved it. You're doing the right thing.
JENNY: I hope so. We'll see. See you tomorrow. Bye. Bye.
VOICE: ( as the Volvo backs out of the driveway ) Remember you're required to have a lesson planned tomorrow.
STAR MAN: ( subtitles ) Iron channel message. Suit and rockets destroyed. Radical mixture of this atmosphere and ours in helmet allowed chemo-ion response time to adapt my body to this air. Am going to attempt extreme transformation in order to cross land mass to site of our practice landings. If transformation is not fatal, second message ball by next darkness.
SHERMIN: Aghh. I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
LYMAN: I wouldn't worry about it. There might not be any little league I'm telling you they're probably Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and UFO coming out of the grass.
MAJOR BELL: I'm telling you they're probably Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and UFO coming out of the grass.
LYMAN: Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and UFO coming out of the grass.
RADAR TECHNICIAN: ( loud ) UFO coming out of the grass.
SHERMIN: Lock in.
RADAR TECHNICIAN: Got it.
LYMAN: This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
SHERMIN: Give it a rest, Lyman.
MAJOR BELL: ( after a pause ) I've never once heard of anybody being hurt by an extraterrestrial. That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to ( to technician, after a look at Lyman ) Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like No, but there sure were a lot of people who saw lights in the sky last night. Reports are still coming ( under above ) I've heard of blood being drawn, sometimes they were taken for a ride in the ship, a lot of times they said they had sex. But nobody was ever hurt.

LYMAN: But you decided those weren't real. This one is.
LYMAN: ( over his shoulder to Shermin )
FOX: I've got something for you.
FOX: Recognize this?
MAJOR BELL: It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
FOX: Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
MAJOR BELL: They must have picked it up in space.
SHERMIN: Then it's not an accident that they found us.
FOX: We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
SHERMIN: Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
FOX: We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
SHERMIN: That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
FOX: We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
SHERMIN: Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
FOX: You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck. You get the feeling we're expendable?
RADAR TECHNICIAN: You get the feeling we're expendable?
SHERMIN: We always were.
STAR MAN: ( practicing the human sound ) ( more precise ) ( well-formed )
JENNY: ( faint through the glass )
STAR MAN: ( precise )
STAR MAN: Jenny ceases her struggle and begins to cry. The STAR MAN takes his hand away from her mouth.
JENNY: Please don't hurt me. please.
JENNY: ( hysteria creeping into her voice ) It's got to be here. it's got to be here.
JENNY: ( in a small voice ) No. please don't.
DR. BERGEN: The creature was hit three times.
DR. BERGEN: .the arm, the abdomen and the upper chest, the one in the chest being the cause of death. It shattered, for want of a better term, the creature's backbone. It's not really, because it's not jointed. It's simply a hollow shaft of very pliable silicate material, as is its entire endoskeleton. The creature seems to have tremendous regenerative powers. Although it must have died within minutes of receiving the fatal wound, the arm and abdomen wounds are almost totally healed and the bullet here. has begun to dissolve.
DR. BERGEN: It has veins but no blood. We think, and this is just speculation, that some form of energy flows from the brain, which is much more sophisticated than ours, throughout the rest of the body. We don't think there is any danger of bacterial contamination. Our biochemistries are too different.
STAR MAN: Don't. don't do this. please.
JENNY: Don't. don't do this. please.
JENNY: ( struggles to free herself ) You're hurting me. Stop.
JENNY: Oh, God, no! I'm not leaving this house with you. You're going to hurt me, I know.
JENNY: ( through tears ) I can't. I'd like to help. You look like Scott, but I know you're not. I don't know what you are. You gotta understand, I'm afraid of you.
STAR MAN: Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever.
JENNY: Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever.
STAR MAN: Which way do you want to go?
JENNY: Which way do you want to go?
JENNY: You can go that way. That way. That way.
STAR MAN: ( measured ) That way.
JENNY: ( staring incredulously at the compass ) God, what are you?
JENNY: ( starting the engine ) I'm sorry.
JENNY: That green dot, that's us, isn't it. and the red's where you want to go?. You don't understand me, do you?
JENNY: ( to herself ) I gotta get out of here.
JENNY: ( startled ) ( thinking the steering wheel is called 'what," he repeats ) ( realizing her mistake ) Ah. no.
STAR MAN: ( thinking the steering wheel is called 'what," he repeats ) ( realizing her mistake ) Ah. no.
JENNY: ( realizing her mistake ) Ah. no.

STAR MAN: Gear shift.
JENNY: ( slaps the dashboard )
STAR MAN: Jenny sees a police car creeping across the intersection ahead of her and interrupts the lesson to stare at it. The STAR MAN looks to where she is looking.
STAR MAN: ( alarmed ) Eh. police.
JENNY: Eh. police.
STAR MAN: ( remembering )
JENNY: ( raps on the steering wheel )
JENNY: Steering wheel.
STAR MAN: ( unprompted, points correctly at each item ) Steering wheel. gear shift. ( this frightens Jenny even more )
JENNY: ( this frightens Jenny even more )
STAR MAN: EXT. INTERSECTION - DAWN We COME DOWN FROM a red light TO FIND the Mustang stopped behind the limit line.
STAR MAN: ( distant )
JENNY: ( distant )
STAR MAN: Jenny sees a set of headlights turn into the oncoming lane. She slides her eyes toward the STAR MAN. He is busy looking through the Coupons. Jenny measures the distance between the Mustang and the oncoming lights. The STAR MAN holds up one of the Coupons and points to a picture of the product.

JENNY: ( curt )
STAR MAN: He points to the cluster of letters that spells SAVE 35¢.
STAR MAN: Jenny doesn't answer. The distance between the two vehicles is narrowing rapidly.
STAR MAN: Jenny sets her jaw and wrenches the steering wheel violently to the left.
MAN: You stupid son of a bitch!!
JENNY: ( screaming ) Help me!!
MAN: You could have killed us both!!
JENNY: ( battling to maintain her grip on the door frame ) He's kidnapping me!!!
MAN: Jesus Christ!! You crazy people.
JENNY: Call the police!!
MAN: ( not sure he wants to get involved ) Hey buddy. let her go.
JENNY: Help me!!!

STAR MAN: EXT. STREET - DAWN The Mustang moves back into the correct lane and continues INT. MUSTANG - DAWN The STAR MAN just stares at her. She points to the gun.
JENNY: Could you put the gun down?
JENNY: Gun. Down. Down.
JENNY: Thank you.
SHERMIN: There's nothing. No reports of sightings or landings or anything. in the other parts of the country or overseas. Seems like a totally isolated incident.
MAJOR BELL: It was only an accident that we discovered them.
SHERMIN: I know, but.
SHERMIN: You married, Major?
MAJOR BELL: Twenty-eight years.
SHERMIN: To the same woman?
MAJOR BELL: ( smiling ) I tried it once. Fourteen years ago. 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this. At least until
SHERMIN: I tried it once. Fourteen years ago. 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this. At least until
SHERMIN: How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
MAJOR BELL: ( after trying to imitate them ) It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
SHERMIN: Listen to this. A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'.
MAJOR BELL: It was a man though. right?
SHERMIN: The police think he was high on
SHERMIN: What do you think?
MAJOR BELL: ( slides the last few feet down the hill ) Nothing up there. The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
SHERMIN: It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
MAJOR BELL: It's the right area, that's for sure.
SHERMIN: Why the clicking language though?
SHERMIN: Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's been some trouble next door. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
MAN: What happened?
SHERMIN: There's a possibility that Mrs. Haydn's been kidnapped. We're hoping you might have seen something.
WOMAN: ( to the Man ) I told you.
MAN: Judy, that's stupid.
WOMAN: Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
MAN: You know that's impossible!
WOMAN: I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
MAN: ( giving up on his wife and addressing Shermin and Lyman ) Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the
STAR MAN: He draws the upper case but has to check the manual for the lower case.
STAR MAN: The STAR MAN looks up as they go by a farm.
STAR MAN: ( pointing correctly to the various animals ) Cow. Dog. Pig.
STAR MAN: He forms both the upper and lower case 'X-x' and shows them to Jenny.
STAR MAN: ( knows what's coming )
JENNY: ( knows what's coming )
JENNY: What's so funny about X?
FOX: ( after a beat ) When can we expect containment?
FOX: ( very controlled ) It's in a green Mustang?
MILITARY MAN: ( to the room ) This one has a weapon.
FOX: Why did you let it get into a populated area?
FOX: Clarify that.
FOX: Repeat the last item.
FOX: ( softly ) Oh shit!!!
JENNY: STAR MAN
STAR MAN: He holds up a quarter.
JENNY: Confused, the STAR MAN puts the money back into Jenny's wallet and reads the first card through its plastic window.
STAR MAN: Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens. Jennyhaydn. Money?
JENNY: ( shaking her head 'no,' exhausted ) We're going to have to stop for gas
STAR MAN: STAR MAN
JENNY: STAR MAN
STAR MAN: Smile. good?
JENNY: He practices curling the corners of his mouth up into a smile. One of them freezes as the Interstate curves and a glistening skyline backlit by the afternoon sun comes into view across a river.

JENNY: What are you doing?
JENNY: .What's that?

JENNY: You're full of tricks, aren't you?
JENNY: ( taps the fuel gauge ) We need gas.
JENNY: No gas.
STAR MAN: No gas.

JENNY: No gas.

JENNY: ( V.O. ) No gas.
JENNY: ( V.O. )
JENNY: ( V.O. ) No gas.
JENNY: No gas. car dead. We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
STAR MAN: Gas good?
JENNY: Yes. Very good.
JENNY: The STAR MAN contemplates the station as they pass it, then turns to Jenny, puzzled:
STAR MAN: It's closed. closed. We need one that's open.
JENNY: It's closed. closed. We need one that's open.
STAR MAN: You'll see.
JENNY: You'll see.
STAR MAN: ( snaps ) Not what. Who. What is for things. ( touching the steering wheel, dashboard, seat, gear shift ) What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he? ( points to the man in the picture ) Who is she? ( points to the woman ) Who are you? ( points to the STAR

JENNY: Who are you?
STAR MAN: I am.
JENNY: That's a big help. Where are you Are you from up there? Space?

JENNY: ( leans forward and points through the windshield at the sky ) Are you from up there? Space?
STAR MAN: ( leans forward to look with her ) Up there. I. eh. can't ( leans back ) But that's the only place you could be from. ( shakes her head 'no' )
JENNY: Up there. I. eh. can't But that's the only place you could be from.

JENNY: My. husband.
STAR MAN: I am husband?
JENNY: No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.

JENNY: No, no. don't say that. Bad word.

STAR MAN: ( draws his fingers over his lips ) You. Mouth closed.
JENNY: The STAR MAN stuffs the gun into the left pocket of his baggy cords just as the Attendant arrives at the driver's door.
ATTENDANT: Morning, folks. Fill her up?
STAR MAN: ( overly loud ) You got it.
ATTENDANT: You got it.
JENNY: I'm going to the ladies' room. You stay here.

JENNY: Women. me.
JENNY: Men. You go in here.
JENNY: Come on.

JENNY: She hands him a twenty.
ATTENDANT: Thank you.
STAR MAN: ( to himself ) Thank you.
STAR MAN: What is. A drink.

JENNY: You want to try it?
STAR MAN: I want to try it.
JENNY: This stuff could kill. Be my guest.
STAR MAN: ( after a loud burp ) Eh. you keep it. I've had enough.
JENNY: Eh. you keep it. I've had enough.
JENNY: What's the matter?
STAR MAN: ( throws the can to the ground )
STAR MAN: What is kidnapped?
STAR MAN: ( yells )
STAR MAN: Kidnapped!!! What is kidnapped?!! Kidnapped is what you're doing to me now!!! Kidnapped is pointing a gun at me and taking me from my house! Kidnapped is changing yourself into my husband. I don't know what you are and I don't care. I just want to get away from you!

STAR MAN: She doesn't dare look at him.
STAR MAN: I am good.
STAR MAN: What is that?
JENNY: ( finally ) ( without looking at her )
STAR MAN: ( without looking at her )
STAR MAN: It is pleasing to him and he listens for a while, then reaches in his pouch and takes out one of the dusty gray marbles. He rolls it between his palms. It changes to a glowing gold as it grows to the size of a baseball.
JENNY: It is pleasing to him and he listens for a while, then reaches in his pouch and takes out one of the dusty gray marbles. He rolls it between his palms. It changes to a glowing gold as it grows to the size of a baseball.
JENNY: ( alarmed ) What are you doing?!
STAR MAN: ( subtitles ) Iron channel message. Transmute was successful. Have captured one of them. It is taking me to the pick-up point in a land vehicle. ( eyeing Jenny ) I think I can control it by mastering its language, which is primitive and easy to learn. Will arrive on time. Wait for me.
SHERMIN: ( sorting it out ) You sure you want this, because. that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over.
SHERMIN: I don't like it, George.
SHERMIN: It's messy. the thing's got a gun. We're just asking for somebody to get killed.
SHERMIN: ( accepting ) You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure. Okay.
MAJOR BELL: They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
LYMAN: Save us all a lot of trouble.
MAJOR BELL: Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
LYMAN: MAJOR BELL
MAJOR BELL: You have no conception of this, do You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this. The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
LYMAN: You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this. The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
SHERMIN: Are you ladies through?.
SHERMIN: Good. It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
LYMAN: Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
SHERMIN: ( to Bell ) Did your people have any contingencies No. I guess we never thought it would happen.
MAJOR BELL: No. I guess we never thought it would happen.
SHERMIN: On one of the screens behind him the camera has picked up a lighted billboard advertising 'Kellogg's Corn Flakes' with its slogan 'HAVE A GREAT DAY.'
JENNY: ( loud ) Red light!
JENNY: ( screams )
JENNY: That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
STAR MAN: ( sheepish ) It was yellow.
JENNY: You didn't even see it.
STAR MAN: I will see it next time.
JENNY: You better.
JENNY: ( indicating the red dot on the satel compass ) Why are you going here? What is here?
STAR MAN: ( searches for word ) .car will take me. ( pokes finger toward sky ) .up there. home.
JENNY: ( at the red dot again ) When do you have to be here?
STAR MAN: I do not understand.
JENNY: ( rubs her temples and laments to herself ) How will I do this one?.
JENNY: ( pointing to the sun ) Sun. day. No sun. night. You Yes. Day. night.
STAR MAN: Sun. day. No sun. night. You Yes. Day. night.
JENNY: Sun. day. No sun. night. You Yes. Day. night.
STAR MAN: Yes. Day. night.
JENNY: How many days and nights do you have to go. Three nights. two days.
STAR MAN: Three nights. two days.
JENNY: That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't.
STAR MAN: I need you.
JENNY: I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep.
STAR MAN: You'll keep the car. I'll take a Am I going up there with you. in your ship. up there?

STAR MAN: Then let me go. You don't need me.
JENNY: Then let me go. You don't need me.
STAR MAN: I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
JENNY: I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
JENNY: Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car. That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
STAR MAN: ( taps the red dot on the satel compass ) When we get here.
JENNY: You bastard.
STAR MAN: He takes his foot off the brake to go after her and the car lurches into the cross traffic. He clambers back behind the wheel, regains control and cuts a hard right in front of the other car waiting at the light.
YOUNG MAN: In a panic to find Jenny, he continues jostling past people to look in the shops that border the atrium.
MEZZANINE: Jenny warily approaches the railing and peers over. Below her the STAR MAN comes out of a record store. She turns away and gets on the escalator to the second floor.
MOTHER: My baby!!! He's stealing my baby!
MOTHER: Burt!! Somebody stop him!! He was stealing my baby!!
MAN: Where you think you're going?
STAR MAN: A tall, skinny blond man with spectacles elbows his way to the Mother.
MOTHER: He was trying to steal Gloria.
BURT: Is that right? Huh?
STAR MAN: ( stutters ) Is that right? Come on. Answer me. Were you trying to steal my baby? Huh? Answer me!
BURT: Is that right? Come on. Answer me. Were you trying to steal my baby? Huh? Answer me!
BURT: Were you trying to steal my baby? Huh? Answer me!
STAR MAN: SECOND FLOOR Jenny has just gotten on the escalator to the third floor when she hears her name. She knows she shouldn't but she gets off and joins the crowd at the railing. From there, she can see the STAR MAN trapped in a circle of people. He clubs Burt away from him and tries to thrash his way out of the One of the T-shirts throws him back and Burt begins to punch him. We MOVE IN UNTIL we are CLOSE ON Jenny's face.

STAR MAN: One of the T-shirts throws him back and Burt begins to punch him. We MOVE IN UNTIL we are CLOSE ON Jenny's face.
GROUND FLOOR: Some of the onlookers have joined Burt in his attempt to bring the STAR MAN down. Growling in his own language, the STAR MAN fights back as best he can. The sleeve of his windbreaker is torn. One of the T-shirts lands a blow on his right shoulder that turns the STAR MAN around. He takes a blow on the chest. Another in the kidneys. Burt gets a grip on the STAR MAN's left wrist and holds on. The attackers close in. Jenny's voice cuts through the din.
JENNY: Get away from him!! Leave him alone!! You stupid jerks!! He's retarded!! Can't you see that?!! Get away from
MOTHER: He was stealing my baby.
JENNY: You're wrong!! He would never do anything like that!! Let's go.
MOTHER: He had Gloria in his hands!
JENNY: He's retarded! I shouldn't have left him alone! Get out of my way.
JENNY: ( hisses ) Get out of my way.
JENNY: Are you okay?
STAR MAN: ( as Jenny puts him in the passenger seat ) Thank you. ( handing it to her ) Gate three. It's boarding now.
CLERK: ( handing it to her ) Gate three. It's boarding now.
JENNY: Thank you.
CLERK: Have a nice trip. The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells.
JENNY: The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells.
STAR MAN: ( pointing to baby ) Is that a baby?
JENNY: STAR MAN
STAR MAN: A baby is a new person?
JENNY: Eh. yes.
STAR MAN: Do you have a baby?
JENNY: No. The closest.
STAR MAN: I'd love to have a baby. But I I can't. Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
JENNY: I'd love to have a baby. But I I can't. Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
STAR MAN: I can't. Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
JENNY: I can't. Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
STAR MAN: But I must go here.
JENNY: I know that. But the buses don't go What is hitchhike?
STAR MAN: ( suspicious ) What is hitchhike?
JENNY: That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
JENNY: Say it.
STAR MAN: 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
JENNY: The driver will.
STAR MAN: But I speak English.
JENNY: Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them. I do not speak English.
STAR MAN: ( indignant ) I do not speak English.
JENNY: Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take. .this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, 'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
STAR MAN: ( impatient ) 'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
JENNY: You want this ticket?
STAR MAN: Then don't be smart.
JENNY: Then don't be smart.
JENNY: That's your bus. When you get to Las Vegas, ask the driver. 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
STAR MAN: ( falling into step next to her ) 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
JENNY: ( hands him the map ) You keep this. Now this is hitch- ( stops in the middle of the waiting area to illustrate ) You stand on the side of the road, the highway. you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this.
JENNY: Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
STAR MAN: The car will stop?
JENNY: ( continuing toward the loading platform ) Not every car, but. a car will stop. Maybe not the first car. maybe number eight, number fifteen.
STAR MAN: When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
JENNY: Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and.
JENNY: .you'll have plenty of time to get to where you want to go.
JENNY: Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on. Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
STAR MAN: Can I have the gun?
JENNY: She maneuvers him into the end of the line.
JENNY: You might need this.
JENNY: Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
STAR MAN: ( nervous )
JENNY: Well. I'm going to go now.
STAR MAN: Yes. I have a long ride ahead of
JENNY: Yes. I have a long ride ahead of
STAR MAN: He watches her walk away.
STAR MAN: STAR MAN
JENNY: STAR MAN
STAR MAN: Please stay.
JENNY: I'll stay till you get on the bus.
DRIVER: The STAR MAN hands the Driver his ticket. The Driver rips out the first coupon and hands it back.
JENNY: See? You're going to be okay.
JENNY: STAR MAN ( touches his cheek ) ( she motions for him to get on the bus )
STAR MAN: ( touches his cheek ) It's a kiss. ( she motions for him to get on the bus ) Let's go.
JENNY: It's a kiss. Let's go.
DRIVER: Let's go.
JENNY: ( softly ) Oh no.
JENNY: What happened?
STAR MAN: I was afraid.
JENNY: Okay, you win. Get in.
SHOPKEEPER: This kind of thing's real bad for He couldn't even speak English.
TOUGH: He couldn't even speak English.
MOTHER: Those kind of people should be shot.
ONLOOKER: What happened?
WAITRESS: I think he was just lost.
BURT: Who's side are you on?
TOUGH: No way he was going to get away from
LYMAN: Where's that?. And it was one person, one way.
SECURITY GUARD: Eyewitnesses are the worst. You get two of them together. You got three stories. You know what I mean?
SECURITY GUARD: Is there a reward in this?
SHERMIN: Huh?. Eh. no, there isn't
SECURITY GUARD: Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
SHERMIN: Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
SECURITY GUARD: Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard. You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
SHERMIN: You saw that?
SECURITY GUARD: Hey. he didn't look like no big time criminal to me. Eh. the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued. But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
SECURITY GUARD: Eh. the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued. But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
SHERMIN: I wouldn't think so.
SECURITY GUARD: ( peeling off ) That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
SHERMIN: We will. Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
LYMAN: ( alarmed ) I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
SHERMIN: ( shaking his head ) Doesn't make sense.
LYMAN: Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
JENNY: You thought we were a different No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and.
STAR MAN: No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and.
JENNY: Stars. When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
STAR MAN: We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My. eh. we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
JENNY: You did? That's funny. So did we.
STAR MAN: STAR MAN
JENNY: STAR MAN
STAR MAN: We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and. the driver of my ship.
JENNY: The captain.
STAR MAN: The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
JENNY: Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
STAR MAN: I don't understand 'friend.'
JENNY: A friend is a person that is good to you. someone you like to be with. someone you like to laugh with.
STAR MAN: He was a good friend. The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
JENNY: The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
STAR MAN: I understand.
JENNY: Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
STAR MAN: What is hell?
JENNY: It's bad.
STAR MAN: He will.
JENNY: What are you doing?
STAR MAN: Are you my friend?
JENNY: STAR MAN ( smiles )
STAR MAN: ( smiles ) I am your friend.
STAR MAN: ( during the above ) Who is God?
JENNY: Nobody knows.
STAR MAN: I don't know.
JENNY: I don't know.
STAR MAN: I like this music.
JENNY: I've noticed. Do you understand what they're saying?
STAR MAN: Not all. but it feels like a kiss.
JENNY: Do you have music up there?
STAR MAN: I'd like to hear it. Can you sing I do not want to.
JENNY: I'd like to hear it. Can you sing I do not want to.
STAR MAN: I do not want to.
JENNY: Don't be afraid. I'd really like to hear it.
JENNY: He turns away from her, clears his throat and begins. His singing is like nothing we have ever heard. Vibrations of tones and glottal stops blend into a haunting, seductive fugue. The STAR MAN stops.
STAR MAN: I am not a good singer.
JENNY: That was beautiful.
STAR MAN: ( incredulous ) You liked my singing?
JENNY: Yes. Sing some more.
CLERK: What can I do for you folks?
JENNY: How much are your rooms?
CLERK: Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
JENNY: You have one with two beds?
CLERK: I'll take that.
JENNY: I'll take that.
CLERK: ( slides her a registration card ) Fill this out. ( as Jenny writes ) Will this be cash or credit card?
JENNY: Credit card.
CLERK: I'll have to run your card off now.
JENNY: ( digging through her purse ) We're only going to be here a few It's still the full price.
CLERK: It's still the full price.
STAR MAN: Jenny, look.
JENNY: Put that back.
STAR MAN: But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
JENNY: Put it back.
CLERK: You can park your car in front of the room.
DRIVER: ( into microphone of his radio ) What did these two do?
SECOND DRIVER: All anybody knows is that they're armed and dangerous.
SECOND OFFICER: Be a piece of cake for us to take
THIRD DRIVER: National Security folks should be here any minute. Let them take care of it. That's what they get the big bucks for.
STAR MAN: I want a drink. May I have two
JENNY: ( handing it to him ) You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
STAR MAN: On the radio they say it's good.
JENNY: Hurry up.
STAR MAN: ( coming to the car with a drink can in each hand ) The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
JENNY: No. Get in.
STAR MAN: ( rounding the hood ) You can have one.
JENNY: ( as he gets in ) I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
STAR MAN: Are you angry at me?
JENNY: No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
SECOND DRIVER: ( as the Mustang rolls onto the frontage road ) They made us. Let's get 'em.
JENNY: INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT Shermin is patched into the Nebraska Highway Patrol and is listening to the pursuit.
JENNY: No!!! No!!!
DRIVER: He's got a gun!!
STAR MAN: Jennyhaydn! Jennyhaydn!!
LYMAN: ( seeing the blood on the passenger seat ) One of them must be pretty badly
SHERMIN: ( to Bell, indicating the suit ) Get this back to the copter.
SHERMIN: ( bullhorn to woods ) Mrs. Haydn, please come out. We don't want to hurt you or your friend. Please put down your weapon and come
SHERMIN: Okay, fan out. These people have a gun but we want them alive.
THIRD DRIVER: Over here! They're over here!
STAR MAN: ( strokes her cheek ) You will be all right.
SHERMIN: Mrs. Haydn, we don't want to hurt you. Put down your gun and come out. We just want to talk to your friend.
STAR MAN: ( subtitles ) Iron channel message. Almost caught by pursuers. This may hinder escape. Wait for me.
WOMAN: Don't forget to tell the boys where you had a good time.
DRIVER: ( calling back to her ) You weren't that good.
SHERMIN: Tell him I'm not here.
LYMAN: I did.
SHERMIN: Get me a radio. At least I won't have to look at his face.
SHERMIN: I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
SHERMIN: ( through a punchy hysterical laugh ) George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
SHERMIN: Maybe. look, this is just something to think about. from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else. I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is.
SHERMIN: I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
JENNY: Hello. hello.
JENNY: Hello. Where are you?
JENNY: Where did you stop last?
DRIVER: What the hell do you think you're Where did you stop last?
JENNY: Where did you stop last?
DRIVER: Stay right there.
JENNY: What was your last stop?
DRIVER: Where's that?
JENNY: Where's that?
DRIVER: About five miles back.
DRIVER: ( shouting after her ) Are there any more in there?
MAN: Where are you going?
STAR MAN: Las Vegas, please. I do not speak Hop in.
MAN: Hop in.
MAN: ( re-entering the flow of traffic ) I can only take you to Grand Junction, but you'll have a better chance to get a ride from there.
MAN: Where you from?
STAR MAN: I don't understand.
MAN: Parlez vous Francais?. Habla Ingles?. Sprechen zie deutsch? Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
MAN: Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
STAR MAN: ( pretending ) I don't understand.
MAN: I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
STAR MAN: COOK ( MAN )
STAR MAN: I understand.
COOK: What do you do?
STAR MAN: ( searches for an answer, then ) I make maps.
COOK: Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
STAR MAN: Eh. yes.
COOK: Make any money?
STAR MAN: ( takes a pack of Camels out of his pocket ) You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for
COOK: ( takes a pack of Camels out of his pocket ) You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for
COOK: The STAR MAN takes it, quickly examines it, then positions it in his mouth at the exact angle the Cook did. His eyebrows raise when the Cook flicks his Bic and puffs an ash on the end of his cigarette. The butane flame is swung in his direction and he flinches back before allowing the Cook to singe his Camel. He copies the Cook's puffing and the end of his cigarette begins to The Cook inhales deeply from his cigarette and blows smoke at the windshield. The STAR MAN mimics the inhalation, then chokes. His eyes bulge and his cheeks puff out as he tries to be cool and not cough. The Cook takes no notice of his Smoke starts to dribble out of the Star Man's nose and mouth. Puzzled, he re-examines his cigarette.
COOK: She wants to become a doctor. She's a bright kid. Hard worker. I think she'll make it. But the damned inflation's driven the tuition up so high it makes it real tough on a family like ours. I got two other kids. I don't know what we'll do when they get old enough for college.
COOK: I got two other kids. I don't know what we'll do when they get old enough for college.
COOK: Everybody blames it on the oil crisis. That might be where it starts. But I think a lot of people are just using that as an excuse to rip the rest of us off. I see it every day in the kitchen. Peaches. We use the gallon cans. The price has gone up three times in the last year. And now the cans are only half full. Do you have children?
COOK: Do you have children?
STAR MAN: They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything.
COOK: They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything.
COOK: What do you think of America?
STAR MAN: It is beautiful.
JENNY: He had on tan cords, a plaid shirt and a baseball cap. probably I don't pay much attention to those In the last hour or so.
ATTENDANT: I don't pay much attention to those In the last hour or so.
JENNY: ( taking out her wallet ) In the last hour or so.
ATTENDANT: Jenny folds back the plastic windows to the picture of her
JENNY: This is him.
ATTENDANT: ( shakes his head )
SECOND ATTENDANT: ( looking at picture ) I don't know. I'm not sure. I might have seen him up the road a piece on my way in. He's long gone by now.
JENNY: You know if anybody here's going to Ask inside.
SECOND ATTENDANT: Ask inside.
JENNY: ( small voice ) Anybody going to.
JENNY: Anybody going to Wisconsin?
JENNY: I need a ride.
OLDER MAN: I'm going to Des Moines. If you can wait till I finish here, you're welcome to ride along.
JENNY: I can wait.
JENNY: ( to the waitress ) Where's the phone?
JENNY: Could you give me the highway patrol,
JENNY: My name's Jenny Haydn. I think you're looking for me. I was kidnapped in Eau Claire, Wisconsin a couple of days ago. But I'm free now.
JENNY: Jenny Haydn. I'm on my way home and I don't want anybody I'm with shot at when you.
SHERMIN: ( hand over the mouth- piece ) You trace it yet?
TECHNICIAN: All we know right now is that it's east of here. This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
SHERMIN: This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
JENNY: I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
JENNY: No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
SHERMIN: Is the man who kidnapped you there I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
SHERMIN: ( his hand over the mouthpiece ) Get a highway patrol unit over there.
OLDER MAN: Jenny holds up a finger that asks for a moment longer on the
JENNY: ( into phone ) Mr. I'm sorry, what was your name Marc Shermin.
JENNY: Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
JENNY: He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
JENNY: ( on her way past the weathered driver ) I changed my mind. Thanks.
JENNY: ( at the top of her lungs ) It's me again.
JENNY: I need a fast ride west.
JENNY: You sure this is your car?
TEENAGER: ( with a stutter ) My grandmother's rich.
JENNY: ( as they come up on a station wagon ) Slow down, slow down.
TEENAGER: Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
JENNY: ( peering at its occupants ) I told you I'm looking for someone.
TEENAGER: In the cars, too?!
JENNY: I don't know where he is.
TEENAGER: This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
TEENAGER: They after you?
JENNY: What? No, of course not.
TEENAGER: ( his stutter thicker than before ) Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
COOK: Well, here we are. You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
STAR MAN: ( getting out ) Thank you.
COOK: And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know. Take care of yourself.
TEENAGER: I bet you we find your friend at the
JENNY: ( to the road ahead ) We better find him before that.
PATROLMAN: The girl's not here, Mr. Shermin. Seems right after she talked to you, she got a ride west with a kid.
SHERMIN: ( into mouthpiece of his headset ) You get that, Lyman?
LONG HAIR: Where you going?
STAR MAN: Las Vegas, please.
LONG HAIR: We're going to L.A.
LONG HAIR: Sure. Get in. We can drop you in Vegas or get you darn close.
TEENAGER: I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
JENNY: If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
TEENAGER: Jenny gives him a withering look.
TEENAGER: The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
JENNY: Pull over. I've got to get back there.
TEENAGER: Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?. What did you guys do?. I won't tell anybody.
JENNY: It's easier not to tell if you don't
TEENAGER: ( as Jenny opens the door ) Wait. Could I have your autograph?
JENNY: She leans back and gives the startled Teenager a kiss on the mouth, then gets out.
TEENAGER: I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
JENNY: Don't worry. I'll be all right.
STAR MAN: EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY Jenny spins around to see the Roadrunner skid to a stop on the shoulder and the STAR MAN get out. A motorcycle bombs by. He starts across the lanes of traffic toward Jenny. A truck blasts past him in the slow lane. He is buffeted into the fast lane. Jenny runs down the center divider to meet him. A VW honks, its tires squeal on the pavement as it swerves around him. He reaches the safety of the center divider. Jenny throws her arms around him and lays her head against his chest. He stands there uncomfortably not knowing how to respond to this human emotion.

STAR MAN: I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
JENNY: The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
STAR MAN: This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
JENNY: The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
STAR MAN: If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
JENNY: Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
STAR MAN: I will go. But not you.
JENNY: You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
STAR MAN: I don't want you to be hurt.
JENNY: Come on.
JENNY: I didn't ask to come along on this trip, but I sure as hell am going to be the one to say when I get off.
SHERMIN: ( into headset ) Any sign of either of them yet?
LYMAN: I don't think they're going to show.
SHERMIN: Okay. Tell the highway patrol to block all major arteries off 70 from here to Elmo's.
STAR MAN: The Cook said I speak good English.
JENNY: Where are you going?
STAR MAN: I must meet my ship.
JENNY: Why can't we wait here for a ride?
STAR MAN: I feel better if I move.
JENNY: We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
JENNY: ( shouts at him ) Even if we walk five miles, it's not going to make any difference.
STAR MAN: ( screams after it ) ( shocked ) Where did you learn that?
JENNY: ( shocked ) Where did you learn that?
STAR MAN: The cook.
JENNY: ( after a few steps ) We're not going to get a ride tonight.

JENNY: What are you saying?
STAR MAN: You can stop. I will go on alone.
JENNY: We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
STAR MAN: I can't stay here. I want to go home. I don't want this skin. I don't want to look like this.
JENNY: ( trying to ease his pain ) Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
STAR MAN: I used the last one to jump off the Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.

JENNY: Can you close the door?
STAR MAN: You are cold.
JENNY: You're damn right I am.
STAR MAN: I do not get cold.
JENNY: ( crossing to him ) Open your shirt.
JENNY: ( savoring it ) Oh, you're warm. put your arms around me.
JENNY: Take your shirt off.
STAR MAN: She brushes her lips against his. The STAR MAN's not sure what's happening. But he's not offended. Her next kiss is full and long. He accepts it with his eyes open and when she eases back he leans in for more. Jenny responds. As if on command, the satel compass comes from around behind the STAR MAN to hover in back of Jenny. He takes it between his palms and extinguishes it.
