QUOYLE: So we should cut it.
PARTRIDGE: Gonna have to.
QUOYLE: Or you could tie me in a sack, throw me in the river. Tell the police you thought it was oddly-wrapped lard.
PARTRIDGE: Might be quicker.

PARTRIDGE: Come by for supper, tomorrow. We'll

BUNNY: Petal went to Florida. She'll be back soon.
QUOYLE: She had an accident.
BUNNY: So do you.
QUOYLE: There was a car crash, sweetie. And they found.you know, the body. Of her friend.
BUNNY: That's right. His big hand has wrapped around one of hers. She doesn't seem to mind. Their faces so close.
QUOYLE: Petal can't come back, she's dead. You know dead. Like the turtle.
BUNNY: We found the turtle. And they found Nestor. Did you find Petal?
BUNNY: You never do. But she always comes back.
BUNNY: Don't worry.
AGNIS: Nephew, I'm your Aunt. Agnis Hamm. You sick? It's nine o'clock.
AGNIS: You sick? It's nine o'clock.
QUOYLE: Uh. No, Bunny and I like to. uh, early to bed, earl.
AGNIS: Losin' your wife, your folks, and your job'd depress anybody. It's a wonder you don't sleep all day.
AGNIS: Thought I'd stay a day or two. Give you some relief with th.
AGNIS: I got one in the car.
QUOYLE: But she was driven by terrible forces, no one could understand. She was a locked door. Even to me.
AGNIS: So she wasn't just a bitch in high heels?
AGNIS: Don't stress. She mighta heard worse from her momma. I'm only guessin'.
QUOYLE: Some people probably thought Petal was bad clear through.
AGNIS: People. Are a cynical lot.
QUOYLE: I think she just couldn't get enough love.
AGNIS: I think the evidence. Is on your side.
AGNIS: I'm headed north, Nephew, to where our family comes from, in Newfoundland. Thought I'd never go back. But the older y'get.
AGNIS: There's a pull. Becomes an ache. As if where your people started held a purpose for you. Like you're a piece in a puzzle.
AGNIS: .lookin' for where y'fit.

QUOYLE: In what sense do you m.
AGNIS: You need to come, Nephew.

AGNIS: The trip'll clear your head. Be educational for the squirt. Teach ya the world's still spinnin' outside this toxic slice o'Hades. And who knows.?
AGNIS: They must have a newspaper up there. Somebody's gotta write it.
AGNIS: Tell the truth, I'd appreciate the company. You two are pretty much my family. A pot o'coffee would hit the spot. Drop o'whiskey would fit nice in it.
AGNIS: A pot o'coffee would hit the spot. Drop o'whiskey would fit nice in it.
AGNIS: Which one's my brother?
QUOYLE: Uh. There's Mom. And that's Poppa. Those are temporary.
QUOYLE: Those are temporary.
AGNIS: Coffee. And maybe a sweet.
AGNIS: She needs to go outside.
BUNNY: I know why.
AGNIS: What say, Guy? The dumpster?
AGNIS: Just a thought.
AGNIS: They actually know the ferry schedule. Show up on time better'n the Newfies.
AGNIS: .image of m'sister, Feeny. She's married to a falconer in Arabia, now. Has to wear a black

BUNNY: The green makes me hurl. Her, too.
AGNIS: Empty 44 years. And look at that roofline, straight as a ruler.
QUOYLE: Take it easy. Floor mighta fallen into the cellar. Not likely. There is no cellar. No foundation, neither. The whole thing's lashed with cable, to iron rings set in the rock! Uh. Why would they do th. Long story!
AGNIS: Up those stairs, Aunt Pinkie slept. So fat she couldn't get down to her chamber pot. Wanna see if she's still there?
AGNIS: Well. Too late to drive that road back 'round the bay. We'll camp in here tonight. Be right as rain.
BUNNY: Which one's Petal's room? I'll sleep there.
QUOYLE: Is that a belt or a crown?
QUOYLE: Sodas get flat withou.

QUOYLE: Be right back, and we'll start talking breakf. Watch out for the dog.
QUOYLE: Yeh, her farts are pretty scary.
BUNNY: I mean. The white one!
BUNNY: The White Dog with the big teeth and the red eyes. The Skinny Ghost owns him. They came last night.
BUNNY: I didn't dream 'em, don't say I did.

AGNIS: The drive's a bitch. We'll buy us a boat.
QUOYLE: I'm not. A water person. A boat. That's the ticket. .not a water person.
QUOYLE: .not a water person.
CARD: As you can see, sometimes y'can't get away. I'm Tert X. Card, the bloody so-called managing editor, copyeditor, rewrite man, mechanicals, ad makeup department, mail and distribution chief, and snow shoveler.
CARD: And you are either a big advertiser come to buy a four-page spread to push your warehouse of left-footed Japanese boots. Or. You. Are the breathlessly-awaited Quoyle.
QUOYLE: That'd be me. The second one.
CARD: Have to do without the Ultimate Cheese, y'will. Himself, Mr. Jack Buggit, is up at the house having charms said over his scrawny chest to clear out that impressive accumulation of phlegm he's been hawking all week.
CARD: Now, there's Billy Pretty. He's something of a landmark and an old fish dog.
CARD: Billy does the Home News page. Poems, baby photos, household tips, and a gossip column, under the byline of Junior Sugg, that is pretty much straight libel.
CARD: In short. He writes the only stuff anybody actually reads.
CARD: Now this miserable ugly Brit, is B. Beaufield Nutbeem. Imagines he's the foreign news chief. Steals every story off that foul shortwave radio and rewrites it in Limey prose. Which bloody Card rewrites in a mystical tongue most charitably referenced as an unacquireable taste.
NUTBEEM: Mine: 'Burmese sawmill owners and the Rangoon Development Corporation met in Tokyo Tuesday to consider a joint approach to marketing tropical
NUTBEEM: Card's rewrite: 'Burnoosed sawbill awnings and the Ranger Devotional Competition met Wednesday near Tokyo to mark up local hairwood.'
CARD: It's shorter, and I got Tokyo right.
NUTBEEM: If misspelled.
CARD: Now what's funnier, Quoyle? My writing style, or the fantasy that any Newfie would read that moosepuckey in the first pIa. How'd the meeting go? Did they agree on a joint marketing approach? Still in progress, old bean. One can only hope.
CARD: There's your miserable desk, Quoyle. We've got no idea what yer s'posed to do. But Mr. Jack Buggit will drop by someday and enlighten us all. Til then.
QUOYLE: Listen to this. 'Well, we see the postman has landed in jail for 45 days for throwing the mail in Killick-Claw Harbor. He said he had too much to deliver, and folks could just take a dip and help This is great stuff. 'A snowmobile mishap has taken the life of 78-year- old Rick Puff, who was on his way home from what the Widow Puff calls a 'screech-in and a carouse,' when his machine fell through the ice. A well- known accordion player, Mr. Puff had served four years in the 1970s for sexual assault on his daughters. Bet they aren't crying, either.' This Billy Pretty can really write! .passes as colorful. Nephew, we can't fix up the house proper on a journalist's wages. So I have un-retired.

AGNIS: Nephew, we can't fix up the house proper on a journalist's wages. So I have un-retired.
QUOYLE: From what?
AGNIS: Upholstery. Been sought after for 33 years, wherever I've lived. This should be the real test, huh?
AGNIS: This is Dennis Buggit, master
DENNIS: Only til I get my lobster license. I'm a fisherman in my soul.
DENNIS: It's a Newfie thing, the compulsion to fish. Y'hear yesterday's tragedy
DENNIS: Brought home 200 pounds of ice. His wife fried it. They both drowned.
AGNIS: With me workin', we'll need day care for Bunny after school. Turns out Dennis and his wife send their little girl to this wonderful saintly woman. How's that for us livin' a charmed life?
DENNIS: Agnis says yer buyin' a boat. Sooner's prob'ly better'n lat. I'm not buyin'. No boat.
AGNIS: Well, course we're buy. Buggit, huh? Any kin to my boss on the Gammy Bird? Oh, yeh. He's m'dad. Gonna chat up yer daughter, or just ignore her as usual?
BUNNY: Warren threw up in your sleeping bag. She's got a stomach problem.
BUNNY: It's called cancer.
ATTENTION QUOYLE!: Ouoyle JUMPS a foot. Looks from Card to Billy to Nutbeem. What's going on?
NUTBEEM: Tell the truth.
QUOYLE: Based on my I.Q. test, huh. Where'd I rate? Advanced squirrel. This ties you with me, an' I own the place.
JACK: Pleased t'meetcha, Billy says yer workin' out.
JACK: Tert Card says he's keepin' an eye on ya. Since he's a self-servin' liar, helluva ad salesman tho, it means he's jealous. And Nutbeem.
THAT NUTBEEM!: NUTBEEM ( O.S., through glass )
JACK: Nutbeem's obsessed with actual news. Makes up for it by manning the sexual abuse desk. Can't keep up with the volume there, we're runnin' three, four a week.
JACK: Card's in charge. Ya hear this and that 'bout his typos, but typos is part of Gammy Bird. Everyone gets a laugh, and gets to figger 'em out.
JACK: An' Billy. Well, Billy's a writer and a fisherman. Me, I'm just a
JACK: Fishin' and the sea is all I am. My pap the same. My boy.
QUOYLE: So he said. Waitin' for his license.
JACK: Naw, my boy's passed. Went to sea and there he rests. Bless his bones. Want two things from ya, Quoyle. First. You cover every local car wreck, take pictures. Front-page photo every week, whether we have a wreck or not, an' we always do. When we don't, we dip into Card's file, he's got some beauties.
JACK: Want two things from ya, Quoyle. First. You cover every local car wreck, take pictures. Front-page photo every week, whether we have a wreck or not, an' we always do. When we don't, we dip into Card's file, he's got some beauties.
JACK: .somethin' that humanizes, makes ya feel. That's what a wreck is. It's always saying, 'There but for the grace of God.'
JACK: Plus. We're starting a feature on the shipping news. What ships come in, what goes out. Whatever's of interest. Throwin' it to you, son. Chance to shine.
QUOYLE: Mr. Buggit. I'm not. Well, a water person.
JACK: Chance. To shine.
JACK: One peculiarity. I'm no joke, son, and I don't tolerate jokes about Newfies. Or them that does.
DENNIS: So this Newfie comes to Toronto. Cabbie says, take ya to meet girls for a good time. Boy says, okay, but I only want a Newfie girl. Right section of the party district, he finds a girl, they have sex, she says that's a hunnerd dollars. He says fine, tips her another hunnerd! She says, wow, can y'come back t'morrow?
DENNIS: Right section of the party district, he finds a girl, they have sex, she says that's a hunnerd dollars. He says fine, tips her another hunnerd! She says, wow, can y'come back t'morrow?
DENNIS: Next two nights, same thing!
DENNIS: He says, I know. Yer ma asked me t'give ya six hunnerd dollars!
DENNIS: Yer the model Newfie, Q, but fer th'boat. Why doncha buy Nutbeem's?
NUTBEEM: I built a Chinese junk. Sailed it up from Brazil. Missed Manhattan by a mile or so, got stranded here when I shipwrecked by Gaze Island.
NUTBEEM: Almost finished my repairs. Be leaving soon. As paleontologists define the term.
NUTBEEM: She's ugly. And the only thing I've ever loved.
DENNIS: Yer story tugs at me bladder.
QUOYLE: Him and Jack. Tell it.
NUTBEEM: Jack Buggit's psychic, start with that. He's got the gift. Specially about the sea.
NUTBEEM: Older brother Jesson, everyone's favorite, even Dennis'. Goes to sea like his dad. One day, rest of the family's sitting by the radio, and Jack goes white.
NUTBEEM: Stands up. Says, Jesson's gone. Walks out of the house. Grief too big for walls to hold it. So Dennis is forbidden the sea. But being free, Newfie, and 21, he goes anyway.
NUTBEEM: So Dennis is forbidden the sea. But being free, Newfie, and 21, he goes anyway.
QUOYLE: And that's enough t.?
NUTBEEM: Death storm. Monster wave cracks her steel hull amidships, one inch crack from starboard to port. Men go in the water. Dennis lost. After a week.
NUTBEEM: They come to Jack, call off the search. He stands like a stone. Then turns, sharp, the way he does. Says only, 'He's alive. And I know where.'
QUOYLE: Man's a witch.
NUTBEEM: Went to sea, alone, in just a skiff. Finds him. Can you guess the odds? Finds him. Finds him. Both arms broke, 99% dead.
NUTBEEM: Boy comes to. Jack says if you ever
QUOYLE: Say it fast.
NUTBEEM: Says fishin' licenses are all spoken for, I'd appreciate you givin' me yours. Jack looked in his eyes. They never spoke ag.
DENNIS: What's bein' blabbed here? Quoyle says you got a nice ass.
DENNIS: Quoyle's right.
DENNIS: To my ass.
QUOYLE: I'll drink to that.
BUNNY: What's wrong with him?
QUOYLE: Hey, how 'bout we ask what's wrong with you? There's nothing wr. Sure, there is. This is Herry, and he has Down's Syndrome. It means he learns things very slowly. Know how to be a dog? He looks fast to me. Maybe he's
WOMAN: The kids waddle off in their canine personas. Alone with the woman now, Quoyle is near-catatonic. Come on, brain!
QUOYLE: Which one of those women is in charge here?
WOMAN: Neither of 'em. They're just moms. Well, my lord, whoever runs the place should be giving this a little more attention.
QUOYLE: Well, my lord, whoever runs the place should be giving this a little more attention.
WOMAN: You think.
QUOYLE: I mean, children need structure. No one's even guarding that craft table, they could be running around with scissors and get hurt.
QUOYLE: Um. I write for the newspa.
WOMAN: Well. I'd better get to work, I see. Providing structure and all. I'm Wavey Prowse, and this is my place. Pardon our antiquated emphasis on individuality and the freedom to have fun.
WAVEY: I'm Wavey Prowse, and this is my place. Pardon our antiquated emphasis on individuality and the freedom to have fun.
WAVEY: Oh, yeh. Running with sharp objects? We save for Tuesdays.
BILLY: Well, she don't wear a ring, cause she lost her husband at sea. Just after the boy was born.
QUOYLE: Well, I was just.
BILLY: .sharpenin' those observation skills. First tool of a quality She has wonderful. Posture. Yer know, I never notic.
QUOYLE: She has wonderful. Posture. Yer know, I never notic.
MELVILLE: Ever seen anything like her? No sir, your wife is very lovl.
MELVILLE: I mean. The ship.
MELVILLE: It was built for Hitler. You've heard of Hitler? Up here in Canada?
QUOYLE: Oh, yessir. He was in all the papers. Way back.
MELVILLE: Finest botterjacht ever built in Holland. Flat-bottomed, she can go right up on shore in a storm. Incredibly heavy, forty tons of oak. Not unlike the barges of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. We heard a them, too.
SILVER: Tell them what happened. In
MELVILLE: Pounded twelve beach houses. Expensive ones. To rubble.
SILVER: Drunk and mean. And smarter than he is.
WHAMM!: Drunk and mean. And smarter than he is.
SILVER: Now tell them. Who let our insurance lapse. Took six very expensive lawyers to weasel us out of it. An inch from
SILVER: Took six very expensive lawyers to weasel us out of it. An inch from
SILVER: Moral of the story? When you marry a tour guide. Confine his authority to mixing the drinks. Same again, So. What brings you folks up from Long Island?
SILVER: My dining salon needs refitting. And the best custom yacht upholsterer in the Northern Hemisphere just moved here. I was forced. To follow. Oh. My. God.
QUOYLE: You are a woman of mystery, Aunt. Mystery and surprise. Silver Melville says you was out there. Be nice in yer story, she's payin' for a piece of this house. You said upholstery. Never said yacht uphol.
QUOYLE: You said upholstery. Never said yacht uphol.
AGNIS: .never said not. Ask better questions, you got a chance fer better answers. Got my shop set up in Killick-Claw, now.
AGNIS: Two good workers. Mrs. Mavis Bangs is an old plow horse like m'self. But Dawn.
AGNIS: Dawn's young and on the sexy side. You oughta drop by and say hullo.
QUOYLE: Where's Bunny?
AGNIS: Upstairs, in what will soon become her room. She'll be all right.
QUOYLE: What does that mean?
QUOYLE: Little early in the day f.
AGNIS: Warren died today. That's what that means.
QUOYLE: Poor old girl.
AGNIS: I used to live with someone named Warren. Died of cancer, after nine years together. Dearest soul on this earth.
AGNIS: Went from the funeral, and bought that dog. Named her Warren. Just so I could say the name a hunnerd times a day. Women are foolish, huh?
QUOYLE: I never thought so.
AGNIS: Bunny wants to bury the dog with me. But I told her I'd rather do it alone.
AGNIS: Some advice about the child?
AGNIS: Don't get down on her level, the way you do. She'll never respect you.
BUNNY: That's the difference.
QUOYLE: Another necklace, huh? Can I help?
BUNNY: You can watch.
QUOYLE: Do I have to take my clothes off?
BUNNY: You look better with 'em on.
QUOYLE: You know. You do look good in blue.
QUOYLE: Give you folks a lift?
WAVEY: We're enjoyin' the walk, thank you.
QUOYLE: Well. My aunt can't bring Bunny to the daycare, she's got her shop now. But I worked it out with my boss. So I'll be bringin' her come next week.
QUOYLE: If that's all right.
WAVEY: Love to have her. I'm sorry, Mr. Quoyle, about the other time. Women can be moody, you know. And
QUOYLE: Only the best ones.
WAVEY: Good afternoon, Dennis. Give our respects to Beety and Marty.
DENNIS: Excellent posture.
DENNIS: People talk.
AGNIS: You were a good girl, Warren, no trouble a'tall.
QUOYLE: So the Newfie drills another hole in the ice, aways off from the first one. Once again, the voice booms,
QUOYLE: So he moves way down the ice. Drills another hole. Voice comes again, I SAID, NO FISH DOWN HERE!
QUOYLE: The Newfie looks around. Still nobody. Hollers, WHO ARE YA? THE VOICE O' GOD? Voice comes back, NO! THE ARENA MANAGER! Heard it before, huh?
QUOYLE: Heard it before, huh?
WAVEY: Sometimes, passion in performance. Beats the element of surprise.
QUOYLE: You guys hungry?
BUNNY: Shhh. I'm teaching Herry to read. Just like I did Warren.
QUOYLE: Is he learnin'?
BUNNY: First is the teaching part. The learning comes later.
BUNNY: Wavey? Now are the berries ready to pick?
PETAL: Want to pick my berries, do you. Should I climb right up on this sink?
WAVEY: Almost. Almost ready. You know, it's all about timing.
CARD: That's yer boat.
QUOYLE: Said it was.
CARD: One question remains. Why. Is that. Yer boat?
QUOYLE: Well. A boat's a boa.
CARD: It's a shit boat. Best thing, get rid of it some dark night.
BILLY: Go hire Alvin Yark to build ya a sweet little rodney. This thing's a wallowing cockeyed bastard that'll sink in a bathtub.
JACK: I'm goin' fishin'.
NUTBEEM: Don't jump off a bridge over it. Anyone can make a brainless, asinine, devastatingly revealing blunder. What in th' furry pit of Newfie hell. Is this!?
CARD: What in th' furry pit of Newfie hell. Is this!?
CARD: Hitler's Barge.?
QUOYLE: That goes with the shipping news. Profile of a vessel in port.
CARD: What about the car accident?
QUOYLE: That's the one I didn't do. Mrs. Diddolate sprained her wrist. Period.
CARD: So you didn't do the one Jack told yer to do, and you did one he don't know yer did! Pretty mu.
QUOYLE: Pretty mu.
CARD: This copy. Is worse. Than yer boat.
CARD: Jack even sniffs this, he cuts you up fer lobster bait. I've half a mind to run it.
QUOYLE: Run it.
QUOYLE: As for the part about you havin' half a mind? No comment.
QUOYLE: Jack, I completely understand, I would fire me, too.
QUOYLE: In a heartbeat.
QUOYLE: You give me a chance, and what happens? I buy the wrong boat, I write the wrong story, I am the lowest form of alleged life. In fact, your comment. .was an insult to the doughnut. Egg salad and Nehi grape. They're mine but I'll share.
QUOYLE: .was an insult to the doughnut. Egg salad and Nehi grape. They're mine but I'll share.
BUNNY: Egg salad and Nehi grape. They're mine but I'll share.
BUNNY: They're mine but I'll share.
QUOYLE: DON'T MOVE!! We're gonna play Wait For Daddy. Can you play that?
DON'T MOVE!!: Okay, that was a little loud. It has also scared the kid out of her wits. Quoyle regrets this. Starts scooching awkwardly down the slope, inches at a time. She's just staring over the side. Hypnotized by the sight. He's slipping toward her. Toward the edge.
QUOYLE: And if you don't move. Until I get there. Then.
QUOYLE: .then you win!
QUOYLE: That. Was so easy.
CARD: Did ya see the Hitler's barge piece, Jocko?
JACK: I saw it. And heard from some who'd done the same. Good. Neatness.
JACK: Reorganize. Start over. Good

WAVEY: Even tho. She never loved you.
QUOYLE: Sorta. Because of it.
QUOYLE: See, love. Isn't about what's good for you. Isn't about what you wish it was. Isn't about what.would make you happy.

NUTBEEM: One. You're moving in with Dennis, no matter how fond you are of his wife. And the boat! Omigod!

WAVEY: Well. You'll grow into it.
QUOYLE: You kiddin'? After the holidays, we'll have to stretch it.
QUOYLE: Not used to a woman. Giving me
QUOYLE: One Christmas with Petal, I gave her eleven things. And I wrapped them. And watched her open them up. She didn't have anything for me. Like every year. But this one time, she said, 'Wait a minute.'
QUOYLE: She didn't have anything for me. Like every year. But this one time, she said, 'Wait a minute.'
QUOYLE: She ran to the kitchen. I heard the fridge open. She came back. With her hands hidden behind her. Then, she held out.
QUOYLE: Two brown eggs. She gave them to me from her own hands. They were cold.
QUOYLE: Must sound really stupid. But they meant a lot to me.
WAVEY: Well. It's the thought that counts.
QUOYLE: I broke 'em, careful. Made her an omelette with 'em. And I saved the shells. In a little box.
QUOYLE: Oh, yeh. They're on a shelf behind my desk. At the paper.
WAVEY: I know how it is. To hold onto something good. In the middle of all the bad.
QUOYLE: Well. I gotta collect Bunny. Beety's gonna have supper waiting.

WAVEY: CLIPS 'er inta the snow bank!
WAVEY: Just two galoshes stickin' outta the snow. She digs 'er way out. Brushes herself off. Looks at him sprawled like a turtle on his back, tied to his massive burden. She says.
WAVEY: YOU THERE! BILLY PRETTY!
WAVEY: WHY CAN'T YOU WEAR A WRISTWATCH LIKE EVER'BODY ELSE?
HEROLD: I shoulda come last night. Seen the show.
WAVEY: Woulda been a thrill for the Christians among' em. They think you're dead.
HEROLD: Well, then we got good news for th.
WAVEY: So does your son.
HEROLD: Even better news for him. You think so.
HEROLD: There's a million reasons to send me away. Good ones. And only two reasons not to.
HEROLD: I love you. And you love me.
QUOYLE: We get so little mention in the wires. Thought you'd like to see.
QUOYLE: Head in the suitcase. The mystery's
QUOYLE: Silver Melville was captured in Moored with a cruise steward. The boy was twenty, a looker, wearing Armani clothes. Driving a nice Lexus.
QUOYLE: Says she did it all for love.
AGNIS: She'd call me, time to time. Husband was a pig. More women should do what she done. Her situation.
QUOYLE: Some women. Shoulda done it to their brother. Cousin Nolan. Hafta pay him a visit.
QUOYLE: Mavis said you buried Warren here. Called it an anniversary.
AGNIS: Of a loss. But not the dog.
AGNIS: What makes us do that, nephew? Give ourselves away to someone. So we can't eat or think or breathe without 'em? I don't know. We just do.
AGNIS: Wonderful, ain't it?
AGNIS: Irene Warren died. The mornin' after a Christmas. We get one true love in life, nephew. She was mine.
AGNIS: Don't mean we can't give love again. And get some back.
QUOYLE: For some, it does. Not for me.
AGNIS: And if that ruffles some small town feathers.
QUOYLE: Y'know what the feathers around here need th' most? A good ruffling, I say.
QUOYLE: Y'know what I need th' most?
QUOYLE: A really big breakfast!
QUOYLE: Hey. Congratulations.
QUOYLE: Last night. On the stage? You
WAVEY: It was easy. I just kept thinkin'. How would Petal do it?
WAVEY: We're friends, right? Friends drink together.
WAVEY: I asked a quest. I'll drink with you. If you're not done yet.
WAVEY: Not drunk enough yet to talk about Petal. Which we always seem to do.
WAVEY: Let's talk about me. Which we don't.
WAVEY: Growin' up, all I wanted from this place was out. Imagine. Give up all this.
WAVEY: I ran off to Toronto, went to school. Wanted to be a social worker. For kids.
WAVEY: Came back one summer. Fell for Herold Prowse. That. Was that.
WAVEY: Did you know I was a liar?
WAVEY: Herold liked other women. But you know how that is. He didn't die. Not that he didn't deserve to.
WAVEY: See, I'm a good liar.
WAVEY: He ran off to Seattle with some bitch. When his damaged son was two months old. And nobody knew.
WAVEY: Like I said. It's four years ago. And it's yesterday.
WAVEY: So I took his boat out. I sunk it. And told my little story. Grieving
WAVEY: I was leaving, of course. Why humiliate myself on the wayout? But a funny thing happened. On
WAVEY: All these funny, odd little folks? They put their hearts around me. So I wouldn't be alone. Having lost the man I loved.
WAVEY: And since I knew, to my shame, that is exactly what I had lost. I let go of the will to leave. I did.
WAVEY: Decided to let my child grow up. Around folks better than his mom.
WAVEY: You're quite the talker. I take pride in that.
WAVEY: Well, this morning. The man I loved. Came back.
WAVEY: Told me he knew. I loved him still.
WAVEY: Okay. Now I'm drunk enough. To talk about Petal.
WAVEY: You're thinking we're kindred souls, you and me. In love with our nightmares.
WAVEY: You don't love your Petal. You hate. Her cheating. Guts.
WAVEY: You have to think it's love. Because if it's not, you're dead inside. So you keep that flame a flickering. Cos it's all you'll ever have.
WAVEY: You see. You're a good liar, too.
WAVEY: Where's the damn eggshells? That's all I came to see. Can you guess how I know about
WAVEY: Can you guess how I know about
WAVEY: Because you and I. Are kindred souls. After all.
WAVEY: So I told my husband. To fuck himself. And the ego he rode in on.
WAVEY: Thanks for the mirror.
WAVEY: If I don't see you. Happy New Year.
BUNNY: I think they're all here. What's wrong?
QUOYLE: They're beautiful. I never saw 'em. All together.
BUNNY: Will she be proud to wear 'em?
QUOYLE: Well. Any woman would.
JACK: What is this? Suicide attempt?
ALVIN: Gotta paint the name. What'll it be? 'The Tall And Quiet Woman'?
QUOYLE: You knew Billy's dad?
ALVIN: Ever'body knows ever'body. But Billy's pap didn't invent the Four Women in a Man's Life.
ALVIN: Well. Which one is Bunny, I wonder? The Maid in the Meadow, mebbe.
ALVIN: Doncha know? They're all the same woman. That's the point.
ALVIN: The Maid in the Meadow, that's her innocence and play. The Stouthearted Woman, is when you need to lean on her.
ALVIN: The Tall and Quiet Woman? That's the silent partner who always walks 'longside, so's yer never alone.
ALVIN: And the Demon Lover. That's just the frostin' on th' cake.
ALVIN: When y'find the woman who's all four? That's when y'got yer one true love.
ALVIN: .like m'Gertie.
DENNIS: My dad went over the side this mornin'. Tangled in th' sling- stone line.
DENNIS: If you could write a memorial t' him. Fer t'morrow's Gammy Bird? I'd be real grateful.
DAWN: Happy New Year, Mr. Quoyle. I'm sorry I missed you at the pageant.
DAWN: I was in the wings, a course. Wasn't our girl somethin'? I say, y'have t'love a woman. Who's in touch with her inner chicken.
DAWN: I say, y'have t'love a woman. Who's in touch with her inner chicken.
AGNIS: Nephew. You okay?
BUNNY: He's okay. He's not sleeping in the box.
QUOYLE: Remember what I told you.
BUNNY: If he's not sleeping. Why do they call it a awake?
QUOYLE: We're the ones have to be awake. To how much we love him.
QUOYLE: And how we should be good to each other. While we have the chance.
QUOYLE: You think?
BUNNY: He looks like he's sleeping. That's cos he's peaceful. No worries, anymore. No troubles.
QUOYLE: That's cos he's peaceful. No worries, anymore. No troubles.
QUOYLE: I found this in Jack's drawer at the paper. I don't know if it's somethin' special.
MRS. BUGGIT: Oh, it's his lodge pin. We were lookin' all over. Dennis showed me what y'wrote fer th' paper. Did Jack proud.
QUOYLE: You hungry? There's sandwi.
BUNNY: Petal's peaceful, too.
QUOYLE: You bet. You can count on tha.
QUOYLE: New Year's present.
QUOYLE: Oh, yeh. It's a Quoyle tradition.
QUOYLE: Thanks. For the mirror.
DENNIS: DAD'S COME BACK!
BUNNY: See. He woke up.
BUNNY: That's a funny thing to say. For the first thing he said.
QUOYLE: What? 'I'm keepin' m'damn lobster
QUOYLE: Maybe he just said it. To make your Uncle Dennis laugh so hard. You think? It's not fair, is it. That Jack woke up. And Petal didn't.
BUNNY: Well. The world's not fair. You
QUOYLE: That's something the world is always teaching us. And sometimes, the learning comes later. You taught me that.
QUOYLE: You know. What we wait for? It's like the main stem of this boat. It gives us our shape.
QUOYLE: See, I know why you saved a place for Petal. All this time.
QUOYLE: Cos I'm the daddy. And you learn how to do. By watching me. You just watched. Better than I knew.
QUOYLE: You just watched. Better than I knew.
QUOYLE: Watch this.
WAVEY: I'm thanking your daddy. For all my presents.
BUNNY: There was only two.
WAVEY: More than two. Everything I need.
WAVEY: Except a necklace.
BUNNY: I got a box of 'em. You could pick one.
BUNNY: Then you'd have everything you need. You want the cheese?
BUNNY: Okay, then. She hands that one to Quoyle. And as she and Bunny look for another, we PULL. .UP and AWAY, an AERIAL ANGLE swirling above the shimmering bay. The boat so far below us. The people tiny specks. They could be Anyone at all.
