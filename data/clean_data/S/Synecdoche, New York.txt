CADEN: I don't feel well.
OLIVE: Daddy, my poop is green. Caden enters the bathroom, looks into the bowl at the green feces and smeared toilet paper. He seems freaked out.
CADEN: Of course, honey.
OLIVE: Did you have green poop when you were little?

CADENOLIVE: Of course not. You probablyI didn't! I didn't eat ate something green!

ADELE OLIVE: Olive, c'mon. You told me I don't want oatmeal. oatmeal. This isn't a Adele growls, grabs the oatmeal, dumps it in the sink.
COW: There is a secret, something at play under the surface, growing like an invisible virus of thought. The sheep nods. Caden pours himself some more coffee, opens the milk carton to pour some in, then sniffs at the spout. He checks the date on the carton. It's October 20.
CADEN COW: Man. Milk's expired. Jesus. But you are being changed by it. Second by second. Every breath counts off time. Caden goes back to his paper. Adele puts a peanut butter sandwich in front of Olive.
ADELE: Here. Now you better eat this.
OLIVE CADEN: I will. The first black graduate of the University of Alabama died. Vivian Malone Jones. Stroke. Only 63. Adele stares out the window at the rain.
DENTIST: 2, 2, 1.3, 4, 2.3, 4, 4. ( to Caden ) Family coming for Thanksgiving?
ADELE: Jesus! Caden! What the fuck ?! Olive, in a nightgown, stands quietly in the doorway, her curled toes clenched. She holds a large stuffed owl.
CADENADELE: Um. I was shaving and My God! Jesus! Look at your Dumbly, Caden tries to look up at his forehead, then squints nervously at himself in the mirror.
CADEN: Do I press above or below it?
ADELE: I don't know! Just. both! Caden sits on the toilet, presses a towel to his head. Adele squats, goes into a spasmodic coughing fit, finishes, opens the cabinet under the sink, pushes her arm through bottles of cleaning products, old sponges, old toothbrushes, toilet paper rolls and other junk to the shut-off valves.
OWLADELE: Whooo. Whooo. Whooo areI can't Oh wait, got it! Adele turns off the water. Olive looks back into the room.
OLIVE: Mommy, Daddy has blood.
CADEN: Will there be a scar?
DOCTOR: Probably. It looks like a mudflap.
CADEN: I prefer there not be a scar.
DOCTOR: That fellow is annoying. He's in here every week. Like clockwork. The off-screen patient continues to whimper. The doctor finishes his work on Caden.
CADEN: The doctor feels Caden's pulse, then listens to his heart. He presses hard against the glands in Caden's neck.
DOCTOR: Changes in bowel movements?
CADEN: A little more yellow than usual. I'd like you to see an A neurologist?
DOCTOR: I'd like you to see an A neurologist?
CADEN: A neurologist?
DOCTOR: What? No, an ophthalmologist. I said, ophthalmologist.
CADEN: The doctor stares blankly at Caden for a long moment, then looks suspiciously in Caden's ears.
OLIVE: ( SINGING ) It's a beautiful day and the sun is shining and yellow. And the world is too big to understand and today is Tuesday and
ADELE: No, it's Friday, honey.
OLIVE: ( SINGING ) And today is Friday and. Olive's singing continues but goes under.

OLIVE: Did you have to get a shot, Daddy?
CADEN: No, honey. ( to Adele ) It's the start of something awful.
OLIVE: Do I have to get a shot?

OLIVE CADEN: I don't want blood! I don't ( holding head ) want blood! I don't wantI can't do this now. You don't have to worry, baby. You don't have blood.
ADELE: You don't have to worry, baby. You don't have blood.
CADEN: Well, I don't think you should tell her she doesn't have blood.
ADELE: Caden, stop it! Olive cries. Adele coughs. Caden stares out the window. It's dark, but his pupils are pinpricks.
CADEN: Thanks for getting me in right The doctor touches Caden's eye repeatedly with a small probe.
OPHTHALMOLOGIST: ( writes in chart, then: ) Could be. But I think we need to get you to a neurologist. Nothing A neurologist?
CADEN: A neurologist?
OPHTHALMOLOGIST: Yes, a brain expert.
CADEN OPHTHALMOLOGIST: I know what a neurologist is. Fine. I just thought from the way you asked
CADEN: I thought maybe you said urologist. Why do I need to see a neurologist?
OPHTHALMOLOGIST: For a look-see. The eyes are part of the brain, after all.
CADEN: That's not true, is it?
OPHTHALMOLOGIST: Why would I say it if it weren't It just doesn't seem right.
CADEN: It just doesn't seem right.
OPHTHALMOLOGIST: Like morally correct? Or right as in accurate?
CADEN: I'm not sure. Accurate, I guess.
OPHTHALMOLOGIST: Hmm. Interesting. The doctor writes in Caden's chart.
CADEN CLAIRE: ( running to stage )Yeah yeah, I'm fine. It's no Oh crap, Claire, are youbig deal. CADEN DAVID David, what's happening here? ( looking back from seat ) Sorry, Caden. Hold on. David runs on stage to deal with the mess.
CADEN DAVID: David, what's happening here? ( looking back from seat ) Sorry, Caden. Hold on. David runs on stage to deal with the mess.
CADEN: It's too late in the game to be having these problems, David. ( to Claire ) You're sure you're okay?
CLAIREDAVID: God yes, it was funny.I know, Caden. I'm sorry. We'll get it. Tom emerges from the car, covered with stage blood.
TOM: Yeah? I was trying something different. I was crashing differently. Ambivalently.
CADEN: I saw that. I like it. Caden meets Tom at the foot of the stage. Behind them a group of technicians are lifting the wall and trying to re- set it. Claire primps in the bureau mirror.
TOM: ( taking this in ) ( CONTINUED ) 12 CONTINUED: ( 3 )12 Great. Let's try it again.
CADEN: Great. Let's try it again.
DAVID: I think fifteen.
CADEN: Why don't you get cleaned up, Tom, and we'll go again. Tom exits. Caden rubs his temples, then heads to the back of the house, pulling out his cell phone. He exits the theater.
HAZEL: I just heard the death of the In more ways than one.
CADEN: In more ways than one.
HAZEL: ( COMPASSIONATELY ) Oh no.

CADEN: That is odd.
HAZEL: I know! Cell phones, they're
CADEN HAZEL: ( chuckles )( back in her book ) See you in a few. Yup.
CADEN: Dr. Heshborg said I should see Dr. Scariano. My pupils don't work.
HAZEL: I keep reading the first line. It's a good line, I think. But I don't know much about literature.
CADEN: Maybe you should read the first line of another series of books.
HAZEL: I'm trying to better myself, Caden. Recommend me something. You're a genius; you must've read nearly a dozen books.
CADEN: Exactly twelve. Have you read ( CONTINUED ) 15 CONTINUED:15 Um, I've read his name. A lot! I ( CONTINUED ) 15 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 15 His whole name?

HAZEL: If you say so, I will. Can't wait till Wednesday. I'm so excited to see it.
CADEN: I hope you like it.
HAZEL: It's pretty impossible that I won't, you know. I mean. She trails off, shrugs. They smile at each other. Caden exits. Hazel looks at her book, re-reads the first sentence.
CADEN: I think I have blood in my stool. Adele looks over, half asleep.
ADELE: That stool in your office?
ADELE: When I was pregnant with Olive.
MADELINE: What was it like?
ADELE: Um. I don't know. Hopeful or something. Like something was going to change.
MADELINE: Something did, no?
ADELE CADEN: Yes, of course. Yes. I mean. big time.
ADELE: Maybe not as much as I had hoped. That's a terrible thing to say.
MADELINE: There are no terrible things to say in here. Only true and false.
ADELE: I feel alone sometimes. I feel exhausted. Can I say something Yes. Please do.
MADELINE: Yes. Please do.
ADELE: I've fantasized about Caden dying and being able to start again. Guilt free. I know it's terrible.
CADEN: It's a nightmare in there.
HAZEL: The car crash?
CADEN: Well. not only.
HAZEL: Sorry. So I'm reading The Trial.
CADEN: Yeah? You like?
HAZEL: Love. I'm such an idiot for not knowing about this book. ( conspiratorial whisper ) It's famous, it turns out.

HAZEL: Cause it's dirty. A whistling noise turns their heads. In the distance a man with an unopened parachute is plummeting.
PLUMBER: Go ahead. I've seen boy parts.
CADEN: Can I piss in your sink?
ADELE: Um, yeah, I guess. Caden pisses in the sink in the corner of the studio. His urine is amber. He finishes and peeks over Adele's shoulder, through the magnifying glass at the painting. It's an amazingly detailed and angrily colored painting of a woman in a state of profound despair, screaming to the heavens, while standing in a field of flames.
CADEN: It's gorgeous, Ad.
ADELE: Thanks. How was rehearsal?
CADEN: Awful. We have five hundred and sixty lighting cues. I don't know why I made it so complicated.
ADELE: It's what you do.
CADEN: Yeah. Anyway, we got through it. I think you'll be impressed.
ADELE: Caden, listen, I'm really sorry. I just can't go tonight. ( off his look ) I'm sorry. I've got to get two canvases ready to ship. By tomorrow. I know it sucks.

CADEN: Yeah. Absolutely. ( squints suddenly ) Sorry. I have a bit of a headache.
CLAIRE: ( kisses his forehead ) I just want to thank you for everything. You've been absolutely brilliant and it's going to be miserable going ahead without you.
CADEN: I'll be around. I'll check in. She gets teary, gives him a kiss on the cheek.
CLAIRE: God, I'm such a baby. She just looks at him and smiles and nods.
CADEN: Ok, Claire. She backs away and gets lost in the crowd. Caden massages his temples. Suddenly Hazel is next to him.
HAZEL: I figured I'd better get in fast.
CADEN: I loved it! And, by the way, Claire is trouble. And not terribly bright. Caden laughs.
HAZEL: I loved it! And, by the way, Claire is trouble. And not terribly bright. Caden laughs.
CADEN: So you liked it?
HAZEL: Are you kidding? I cried for like fifteen minutes after. I loved every minute of it. Except Claire. I thought she was weak.
CADEN: Easy on the eyes.
HAZEL: Oh, Caden, not you, too. What I want to know is why she started crying in her last monologue, right after she had the line, 'I can't cry for you Willy.'?
CADEN: ( LAUGHING ) She felt very strongly that it was They sip their drinks.

CADEN: ( LAUGHING ) Yeah, it really could.
HAZEL: You're absolutely zero fun.
CADEN: You know I wish I could.
HAZEL: Jesus, I like you. I'm going.
CADEN: You're not staying for the reviews?
HAZEL: I know it's brilliant. I don't need some dope with elbow patches telling me. She smiles, gives him a hug, and heads toward the door.
LATER: Hazel studies the dog. It's a bloody, gutty mess, squashed flat. Against all odds, it's still alive. Its head is lolling. She bends down to pet it.
HAZEL: You're not going to make it, baby.
CLAIRE: What are you going to do now?

REALTOR: The sellers are very motivated now.
HAZEL: It's a scary decision. I never thought I'd buy a house alone. But, y'know, I'm 36, and I wonder what I'm really waiting for.
REALTOR HAZEL: Home-buying is always scary.But I mean with the fire and all especially.

ADELE: It doesn't matter what I think.
MARIA: Absolutely! It's all about your artistic satisfaction, Caden.
OLIVE: What's wrong with your face, Daddy?
CADEN: It's pustules. It's called sycosis. Spelled differently than psychosis, but it sounds the same.
OLIVE: I don't know what that means.
CADEN: Well, there's two different kinds of psychosis. They're spelled differently. P-s-y is like if you're crazy and s-y is like these things on my face.

OLIVE: ( compassionate whisper ) But I have to.
CADEN: But I'll miss you.

CADEN: Where will it take you?
OLIVE: ( THINKS ) 33 INT. SCHENECTADY THEATER - SPRING 2006 - NIGHT 33 Performance in progress. There is now a cemetery on stage. Linda, Biff, and other characters stand around a gravesite.

CADEN: I think I might have arthritis. Adele continues to talk on the phone.
ADELE: No, I know. Exactly. Caden picks up the newspaper. It's dated May 25th, 2006. He flips through, finds the obituaries and starts to read.
CADEN: My joints are stiff. Who was that?
ADELE: Right. It's been three hours since you spoke.

He is sweaty and focused.
HAZEL: We should get a drink. Be fun.

HAZEL: Um, I bought this really nifty sweater today. On sale. Fifty dollars reduced from three hundred!
CADENHAZEL: It's beautiful.It's cashmere. So very soft. You must feel it. Hazel holds her arm out. Caden touches it.
CADEN: What do we do with all this, Hazel?
HAZEL: I don't know. We fuck? We continue to sort of flirt? You divorce your wife and marry me and I make you happy for the very first time in your life and all your symptoms disappear?
CADEN: Do I have to choose at all?
HAZEL: No, I suppose not. Choosing is not your strong suit. You want to come over to my place, Cotard?
CADENHAZEL: Um . I'm won't let you off the this time.
CADEN: Adele is only on vacation.
HAZEL: She hasn't called you since she left. You've left countless messages. It's been a year.
CADEN: It's been a week.
HAZEL: ( stares at him, then: ) I'm going to buy you a calendar. Caden rips a cocktail napkin into little pieces.
CADEN: Okay, just for one drink. Hazel smiles and stands. She scoops up the torn napkin pieces and puts them in her purse.
HAZEL: Scraps for my scrapbook. Caden watches her ass as she turns to leave.
CADEN: I really can't drink very much because of my condition.
HAZEL: Caden's mysterious condition. Well, have one sip, anyway.
CADEN: Did you put something in it?
HAZEL: Would you like me to have? A little love potion, perhaps?
CADEN: Sure, why not?
HAZEL: If that's what it takes, consider it done. Poof! Love potion number
CADEN: It's good. She takes a sip of her drink. Caden drinks some more of his.
HAZEL: Does it make you want to kiss me?

CADEN: Oh. Ok. Great. Have fu The connection is lost. Caden sits there, looks at the 2007 tax form in front of him, goes into convulsions. He manages to grab the phone, his hand flopping all over the dial.

50OMITTED 50: SYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007 42. A51 OMITTED A51 51INT. HOSPITAL - 2008 - NIGHT51 Caden waits on a plastic chair in a dimly lit hallway, his beat-up suitcase at his feet. He reads a very old Vogue and opens to a spread about his wife. She seems glamorous. There are photos of her in Berlin, her work, her flat. She is the toast of the art world. Photos of her with two men, and also with Olive, who seems somewhat Nazi Youth-like now.
NURSE: Mr. Cotard? He looks up, having forgotten where he was. He grabs his suitcase and follows the nurse down a dismal hallway: gurneys against dirty walls, empty wheelchairs. Skinny man takes a flash picture of Caden. Nurses drinking coffee out of paper cups eye him. Puddles of vomit on the floor. They arrive at the end of the hall. A doctor pokes his head out of a room. He studies a file and doesn't look up.
DOCTOR: Mr. Cotard?
DOCTOR: You've had a seizure of sorts.
CADEN DOCTOR: What does that mean?Seems to be some synaptic degradation. Fungal in origin. Autonomic functions going haywire.
CADEN: It's serious?
DOCTOR: We don't know but yes. They both sit there in silence for a long while.
HAZEL CADEN: Be quiet, Squishy.Hi.
HAZEL: Caden, I won't be yet another woman you feel guilty about.

MADELINE: That's wonderful. God bless! I guess you'll have to discover your real self. Right?
CADEN: Yeah, I mean, yeah. Oh, I wanted to ask you, how old are kids when they start to write?

64OMITTED 64: 65INT. QUINCY'S - 2009 - DAY65 Caden sits with Hazel. She seems somewhat distant.
CADEN: The idea is to do a massive theater piece. Uncompromising, honest. I don't know what it is yet or how to do it, but it'll come. It'll reveal itself.
HAZEL: HereÃ¢â¬â¢s what I think theater is: itÃ¢â¬â¢s the beginning of thought. The truth not yet spoken. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a blackbird in winter. The moment before death. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s what a man feels after heÃ¢â¬â¢s been clocked in the jaw. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s love. in all its messiness. And I want all of us, players and audience alike, to soak in the communal bath of it, the mikvah, as the Jews call it. WeÃ¢â¬â¢re all in the same water, after all, soaking in our very menstrual blood and nocturnal emissions. This is what I want to try to give people, Hazel. And I want your help. Hazel just stares. The food arrives. Caden looks at his plate and concentrates.

HAZEL: I'm not sure I can work with you, Caden. I'm kind of angry.
CADEN: I just want to normalize it, Hazel. I think we'd have fun together. He swallows some food then concentrates. She watches him.
HAZEL: It's really disturbing.

CADEN: What'd you do to my family? What'd you do to my daughter?

When they head to the pool, Caden just continues, without hesitation, to the edge of the roof, and begins to climb over. A passing lifeguard sees Caden, grabs him and wrestles him to the ground.
OLIVE'S VOICE: ( with German accent ) How I love Maria! She is so much more of a father than Caden ever was, with his drinking and unfortunate body odor and rotting teeth. I could only loathe him and perhaps pity him. But Maria! Caden blots his sopping brow and gums, sniffs under his arms.
CADEN: It's me.
CLAIRE: I just want you to love us. Caden hugs her. Ariel hugs Caden's good leg.

SAMMY: Amazing artist though. The best living artist. There's no one who stares the truth in the face like she does. A sweet pussy, too. Caden looks at Sammy, confused.
CADEN: How do you know that?
SAMMY: Oh. I read it.
CADEN: Anyway, I don't know where she is. A strange dirigible flies very low overhead.
SAMMY: Maybe she's got a sublet in New York. Maybe the Met's doing a retrospective. Maybe, baby. He hands Caden a slip of paper.

OLD PERSON: I asked you to hold the door.
CADEN: Have a good night. He picks up his pace, trying to be casual about it. He arrives at 31Y, glances over and sees the old person knocking feebly on a door down the hall.
OLD PERSON: Frances, I need to go to the clinic. Something's terribly wrong with my nose. Caden knocks on 31Y. No answer. He knocks again. Down the hall, the door opens and another old person steps out into the hall. This person examines the first old person's nose.

SAMMY: I'm not firing him, Claire. He's the best thing in the show. Next to you.
CLAIRE: He's coming on to me. He's feeling my ass during rehearsal.
SAMMY: He's your husband. Claire turns to the real Caden and screams.

SAMMY: Caden, time out?
CADENSAMMY: What's up? I feel we need a Hazel in here. There's a whole side of Caden I'm not able to explore without a Hazel. Caden looks over at Hazel. Claire watches Caden from the street corner.
CADEN: I guess, yeah. Claire walks off in a huff.
HAZEL: I get to be a character? Hooray!
OLD PERSON: Hello, Ellen.
ADELE'S VOICE: Hi Ellen. Crackerjack job last night! Would you do sheets again? We had quite a fuck last night and it's musky and gross. Kisses, A. Caden smells the sheets, strips the bed.

CLAIRE: I'm not talking to you. Claire turns to Caden.
CADEN: I didn't say I was going to clean Hazel's toilet. He did.
CLAIRE: But you thought it. There's a silence. Hazel watches Caden closely.
CADEN: I thought it. But I didn't say it. Claire packs up her stuff.

SAMMY: Morning, Haze.
TAMMY: Hi, Caden. How was your night?
SAMMY: Okay. Yours?
TAMMY: Eh. Philip was colicky. I was up all night. Caden looks over at Hazel for confirmation. She nods, slightly freaked out.
CADEN: ( to Tammy ) Sorry. Everybody here?
SAMMY: ( to Tammy ) Sorry. Everybody here?
TAMMY: ( looking at clipboard ) Sammy's not here. Jimmy called and said there's some subway problem. Jimmy rushes into the warehouse.

TAMMY: Yeah. We'll take it from June 9th? Sammy nods, heads toward the set designer's office.

CADEN: Hi, Millicent. Have a seat. How are you at cleaning?
MILLICENT: ( SITTING ) I'm very, very good at it.

CADEN: Where're Sammy and Hazel? Tammy jerks her head to the left. Caden sees that Sammy has Hazel with her back against a wall. They are talking intimately. Caden approaches.
SAMMY: Hi, Caden. I'm being you. You like Hazel; I like Hazel.

CADEN: A little moustache? She shrugs.
CADE: Anyway, Thanks for coming with me.
TAMMY: It's okay.
CADEN: I asked Hazel but she was busy tonight and you're the next best thing. I mean, it isn't that you're the next best thing but because you play her, it feels comforting. Does that make sense? Although the thing is offstage you're nothing like her. You play her very well though. Did Hazel mention what she was doing tonight because I called her house before we left and her husband said she wasn't going to be back till late and I thought that was weird because she told me Philip was She's going to dinner with Sammy.

HAZEL: You want me to be sad that someone's taking me out to dinner? I don't know how to do that.
CADEN: I want you to be sad that we had something really special and it's going away!

CADEN: Okay. If you think it's okay. Tammy laughs, matter-of-factly gets undressed in front of Caden. He just stands there uncomfortably.
TAMMY: I get undressed every day.
CADEN: In front of someone is different.
TAMMY: I don't see why.
CADEN: Maybe because you have a beautiful body. Maybe that makes it easier.
TAMMY: I suppose it might. Do you want to I do. Yes. Um. Do you?

CADEN: No. No. I like women. I only like women.
TAMMY: Well, I'm getting cold. She climbs into bed.
CADEN: Thanks. Thank you for saying that.
TAMMY: Come to bed, Pretty Caden. Caden turns off the lights and climbs into the twin bed with Tammy. She looks at his face, then kisses him.

CADEN: It would be verisimilitudinous.
TAMMY: It would be verisimilitudinous.
CADEN: Yeah. I don't know. I have to speak to the fire marshal.
TAMMY: It would be very verisimilitudinous if you could.
CADEN: I think both of you Hazels are going to like this. Turn off here. Hazel rolls her eyes, drives down an exit ramp.
CADEN: Hank! Okay! The house begins to smoke.
TAMMY: My house! Tammy kisses Caden on the cheek and runs into the house.
HAZEL: Is there no end to your pussy It's verisimilitudinous. I'm thinking of that as a title.
CADEN: It's verisimilitudinous. I'm thinking of that as a title.
HAZEL: Whatever. I've got work to do. Tell your girlfriend to get out here if she wants a ride back.
CADEN: She's not my girlfriend.
HAZEL: Give it a rest, Caden. I can smell her on your breath.
CADEN: ( BEAT ) Tammy! We have to get back.
SAMMY: Jeremy is playing to us. Tell him he simply needs to talk to Donna. We'll hear what we hear. Tammy takes down the note.
CADEN: Sammy's explaining too much. Feels expository. Needs to be shorthand, like, "Jeremy big." Hazel writes that down. They all continue down the hall.
TAMMY: Caden? Can we stop for a second?
CADEN: If Hazel's in love with Sammy and Caden's in love with Hazel, there would be a dramatic confrontation, where Caden turns to me and says, "It's obvious he's a substitute for me." I think then Hazel could have a good moment where she cries or gets angry. I'm not sure which yet, but it feels dramatically That didn't happen, Caden.

CADEN: Fuck. I have to let the actor who plays Derek go. What is his name?
HAZEL: That's such a romantic response. I'm touched.

An enormous crowd there: all the actors from the play, Caden and Hazel in front. Hazel weeps. Caden looks at the assembled group, from face to face.
CADEN: I know how to do it now. There are nearly thirteen million people in the world. Try to imagine that many people! None of those people is an extra. They're all the leads of their own stories. They have to be given their due.
CADEN: Do you see what I'm saying? Hazel has her head in her hands. She looks over at Caden, Come over tonight? Please?
HAZEL: Come over tonight? Please?
CADEN: We could get a place together. We could get a loft.
HAZEL: God, Caden, that sounds nice. I miss my daughter. Maybe she could come live with us.
CADEN: Yeah. I miss Olive. And the other one. The retarded one.
HAZEL: I'm a bad person.
CADEN HAZEL: No you're not. I'm a badI am. I should never. have person.gone out with Sammy. I was just trying to get to you.
CADEN: You can't cause someone to kill himself. He was troubled.
HAZEL: I'm so ashamed of myself. Caden walks over to her and touches her shoulder.
CADEN: My heart aches so much for you.
HAZEL: We're here, Caden. I'm here.
CADEN: I'm aching for it being over.
HAZEL: Yeah. The end is built in to the beginning. What can you do?
CADEN: God. You're just perfect.
HAZEL: I'm a mess. But we fit, don't we. They kiss, then Hazel climbs into bed.
CADEN: It doesn't always happen for me now. Because of the medication and everything. I take a lot of pills.
HAZEL: I don't care. It's okay.
CADEN: ( climbing into bed ) I'm embarrassed. I just want you to know it's not you. And it's not me. It's the medication. They are tender and quiet and intensely focused. The smoke in the room is dense. When it's over, they lie there quietly, with the occasional cough from both of them. Caden cries quietly.
HAZEL: It's okay. It's different crying this time. I can tell. I'm crying, too. And I cried last time. After you left. I never told you. But I cried, too. Caden kisses her again.
CADEN: I have a title. The Obscure Moon Lighting an Obscure World.
HAZEL: I think it might be too much.
MEDIC: Might be smoke inhalation. Caden just nods his head for a long time.
MARIA: Olive wants to see you. God knows why; the way you abandoned her.
CADEN MARIA: Oh, shut up.She's had a fucked-up life with issues, thanks to you.
CADEN MARIA: You're insane.She's dying, asshole. Is that insane enough for you?
MARIA OLIVE: Hello, darling. Hi.
MARIA: This is him.
OLIVE CADEN: Hello.Hi, Olive. I've missed you so much.
OLIVE: Maria, would you leave us? Maria kisses Olive again on the forehead.
MARIA: In heaven, my darling. Maria exits.
OLIVE: ( broken English ) Forgive me but no longer remember English. Speak German?
CADEN OLIVE: No. I'm sorry.I had hope you have learned. Weakly, Olive points to a headset on her night table. She pantomimes putting it on. Caden puts it on. Olive puts on her own. There follows a slightly delayed and staticky translation, in an accented male voice, of everything Olive says, with a delay between what Caden says and Olive's response, as she listens in translation.
CADEN: It's Maria. She did this.
OLIVE: Maria gave me reason to live once you left. The flowers defined me.
CADEN: Your mother and Maria took you away. I tried for years to find you. I didn't leave you.
OLIVE: You did something. Caden is affected by this. It resonates.
CADEN: What? I'm not a homosexual!
OLIVE: Maria said you would deny it.
CADEN: She's lying to you.
OLIVE: I had the same struggle when I first fell in love with Maria and we began to have dirty, aching sex.
CADEN: Maria is your lover?
OLIVE: Of course. She introduced me to myself. To my vagina and to hers.
CADEN: You have no idea how evil she is.
OLIVE: I need to forgive you before I die, but I can't forgive someone who has not asked for forgiveness.
CADEN: I have no time! I need you to ask for forgiveness!
I: I have no time! I need you to ask for forgiveness!
OLIVE: I have no time! I need you to ask for forgiveness!
CADEN: ( long pause ) Can you ever forgive me?
OLIVE: For what?
CADEN: For abandoning you.
OLIVE: "For abandoning you to have anal sex with my homosexual lover Eric."
CADEN: For abandoning you to be have anal sex with my homosexual lover Eric.
OLIVE: ( long hesitation ) No. No, I'm sorry, I cannot. Olive dies. Dead flower petals slip from her hospital gown. Caden sits there. Maria hurries rushes to Olive's side.
MARIA: I hope you're happy, faggot. Caden gets up and leaves.
CADEN: My love. I know how to do the play. It'll take place over the course of one day. The day will be the day before you died, the happiest day of my life. I'll be able to relive it forever.
CADEN: I need a Caden for my Hazel.
MILLICENT: I. I'd very much like to play ( CONTINUED ) Tammy watches intently. Millicent smiles at her.
CADEN: ( CONTINUED ) Tammy watches intently. Millicent smiles at her.
MILLICENT: I know it would be non-traditional casting, but I think I'm right for it. I think I understand Caden.
CADEN: I don't understand him.
MILLICENT: Caden Cotard is a man already dead, living in a half-world between stasis and antistasis. Time is concentrated and chronology confused for him. Up until recently he has strived valiantly to make sense of his situation, but now he has turned to stone.
CADEN: Okay. That sounds good.
MICHAEL: She's right? I didn't see that at all. I saw it all as more hopeful.
MICHAEL: Any thoughts for today's rehearsal?
CADEN: ( BEAT ) I have a new title, maybe. Infectious Diseases In Cattle.
MICHAEL: The title is about a lot of things. You'll see. It's about a lot.
CADEN: The title is about a lot of things. You'll see. It's about a lot.
MICHAEL: Yes. I don't see what that has to do with anything.
CADEN: Do you know someone named Eric?
MICHAEL: ( DEFENSIVELY ) 179 INT. WAREHOUSE - CEMETERY SET - 2050 - DAY179 Caden, in "Director Wig," and Michael watch Millicent, dressed Caden-esque, sitting at the director's table. Tammy, in Hazel's sweater, sits next to her. They watch the "Sammy Funeral" scene replayed with actors playing Tammy playing Hazel and an actor playing the stand-in for Sammy playing Caden. Tammy has her head in her hands. She looks over at Millicent, imploringly.
TAMMY: Come over tonight? Please?
MILLICENT: I'd like that.
CADEN: Ok, take off the sweater. Tammy takes off the sweater, puts it on the chair back.
TAMMY: I'm hot.
MILLICENT: Yes, you are.
CADEN: Smile shyly at each other. They do. It lingers. Millicent looks over at the funeral scene. It's dull and static.
MILLICENT: This is tedious. This is nothing. Millicent touches Tammy's hand, heads over to the funeral scene. She whispers things to some actors, has longer conversations with others.
MICHAEL: What's she doing?
TAMMY: He's directing.
MICHAEL: She's not getting the feel of you, Caden. You don't move around. You don't talk to people. It's not
MILLICENT: Okay, folks, let's run it! The scene comes alive with specific activity: weeping Hazel, a little boy in the back playing with dirt clods, a man and a woman eyeing each other flirtatiously from a distance, an old woman with Parkinson's fiddling with Rosary beads, a well- dressed woman squatting and peeing near a gravesite. A minister addresses the mourners.
MINISTER: Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you'll never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. Even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope for something good to come along. Something to make you feel connected, to make you feel whole, to make you feel loved.
NIGHT: Caden sits with Michael at the director's table and stares into space. The actors are doing what they've always done, milling, walking to and fro. Millicent, holding hands with Tammy, heads up the walk to the Hazel's house set.
CADEN: She turns. He waves her over. Tammy sits on the stoop.
MICHAEL: It really was! Delightful!
MILLICENTCADEN: Thanks.I'm out of ideas. I'm dead.
MILLICENT: Oh. I. could take over. as you. for a bit. Until you feel Yes! Yes! Caden, looks sideways at Michael, remains silent.
MICHAEL: Yes! Yes! Caden, looks sideways at Michael, remains silent.
MILLICENT MICHAEL: I think you're tired, Caden.Yes. I think you just need All these years of creative some time. To regroup. I need to keep my hand in.
CADEN: I need to keep my hand in.
MILLICENT: Well, Ellen needs to be filled.
CADEN: Filled? You mean.?
MILLICENT MICHAEL: Her role. Just for a bit. It's a choice role. Just until you're refreshed.
ADELE'S VOICE: Ellen, Olive has died. It's a time of overwhelming grief so please forgive my mess; I haven't been able to get out of bed. Until today. Much affection, A. Caden crosses to the window and looks up at the night sky, even though it's clearly the ceiling of the warehouse. A tiny plane flies by.
CADEN: OLD PERSON #2 ( ACTOR ) Caden asked me to give you this. You're to keep it in all the time.
MILLICENT'S VOICE: . touched by the sadness of Adele's neighbor. So close to death. Reminds me of granny. I should really call her. Remember how Granny Bascomb bounced me on her knee pretending to be a horsie. I loved that so much. Say thank you to Adele's neighbor.
CADEN: Thank you.
MILLICENT'S VOICE: Now say, have a very good day.
CADEN: Have a very good day.
MILLICENT'S VOICE: . miss him. Why did he have to get bored with me? Everyone gets bored with me. I'm not very bright. And since I put on that weight, I don't get the looks I used to. It's not that bad. Lots of people have it worse. I've got a job and place to stay. Adele is nice to me. And so smart and talented. I don't understand her artwork, but that's just me. I wish I'd gone to college. I feel stupid around educated people like Adele. Eric was too smart for me, too. We didn't talk at all near the end.
ELLEN: I'm making eggs.
ERIC: Everything's everything.
MOTHER: Ellen, why do you look so serious?
ELLEN: I'm going to remember this moment for the rest of my life, mama. And in exactly twenty years, come here with my daughter and have exactly the same picnic.
MOTHER: Baby, that's the loveliest thing I've ever heard.
ELLEN: There was supposed to be something else. I was to have something. A calm. A love. Children. A child, at least. Children. Meaning. I am always on the verge, never more than a tiny shove from tears. I can feel them in my chest now. That squeezing pressure. And it is so tempting to let go, but I am afraid, the next time maybe, I will never stop crying. I miss my husband even though he is lying here. He hates me. Oh God. I have disappointed him and he hates me. The one person who should be able to see me and he won't look. He will never look again.
MORNING: Caden lies on his back, and opens his eyes. His pumps drone.
CADEN: ( quietly, mournfully ) Caden looks over. No note from Adele. He gets out of bed, glances in the mirror, seems surprised by his reflection.
MILLICENT'S VOICE: My period is late this month. I wonder what's going on. I'm bloated. I wish it would come.
MILLICENT'S VOICE: I can't believe she said that to him! She's a slut, anyway. He sticks a bookmark in the book, puts it on the night table, turns off the light, and lies on his back with his eyes open.

MILLICENT'S VOICE: Get up. Look at the night table for a note from Adele. Caden gets up and glances at the night table. A type-written
MALE VOICE: Adele died of lung cancer last night. You may stay on if you MILLICENT'S VOICE Look shocked. Weep. Caden looks shocked, then weeps.
MILLICENT'S VOICE: Look shocked. Weep. Caden looks shocked, then weeps.
CADEN: The woman turns. She's middle-aged, face radiating kindness.
WOMAN: Mostly dead. Some have left.
CADEN: Would you sit with me for a moment? I'm very tired. And lonely. The woman smiles at Caden. They sit on a log.
WOMAN: I was the mother in Ellen's dream. Perhaps from there.
CADEN: Yes! That's it. Yes. You seem a bit older than I remember.
WOMAN: ( CHUCKLING ) That dream was quite a while ago. He's silent. The woman touches his hand.
CADEN: I didn't mean to say you look old.
WOMAN: I know.
CADEN: Everyone's dreams in all those apartments. All those secrets we'll never know. That's the truth of it all the thoughts nobody will ever know.
WOMAN: It's true.
CADEN: I'm sorry the experiment didn't work. I wanted it to with all my heart. I wanted to do that picnic with my daughter. I feel I've disappointed you terribly.
WOMAN: No. No. I am so proud of you. Caden starts to tear up.
CADEN: All I want is someone to see me, someone to look at me with kindness. For me to be the most special person in the world to just one person.
WOMAN: I know, baby. I know. He looks at her tentatively. She's looking into his eyes directly, clearly, kindly. She smiles.
CADEN: I know what to do with this play now. I have an idea. I think The screen goes black fast.
