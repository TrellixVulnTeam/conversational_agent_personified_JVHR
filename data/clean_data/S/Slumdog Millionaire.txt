CONSTABLE SRINIVAS: The Inspector asked you a How much is bhelpuri at Jeevan's stall on Chowpatty Beach?

MOTHER: Yes. We need rain.
SALIM: Krishna, quick!
KRISHNA: No way! You're a bloody Muslim. Get away from me!
MOTHER: Salim and Jamal scramble out and retreat into the lanes. Salim turns to see his Mother felled by a rioter. She is surrounded by screaming, chanting men who rain blows down on her. Jamal runs back and drags Salim down an alley. As they head down the alley, they get glimpses of burning houses, fleeing women, a three- year old boy in a doorway, painted entirely in garish blue. He stares at them. In his hand, he is carrying a bow and arrow. An eleven-year old girl dressed only in a pair of pants runs after them.
JAMAL: Then Mister Nandha starts walking towards him. An oasis of calm in the chaos. Jamal looks at him with relief.
MISTER NANDHA: Ram nam satya hai, Babri Masjid dhvasth hai.
JAMAL: Mister Nandha?
MISTER NANDHA: We have destroyed your mosque. Now, the followers of Ram will drive you dogs out of our city.

JAMAL: She could be the third I am the head of this family, now. And I say no. Piss off,
SALIM: I am the head of this family, now. And I say no. Piss off,
JAMAL: Where's your Mother? I'm Jamal. He's Salim.
LATIKA: Jamal goes back to his water pipe, climbs in. Watches her huddled under the sheet. Sighs, motions for her to join him. She darts across, jumps into the water pipe and huddles up next to Jamal.
JAMAL: I wake up every morning wishing I didn't know the answer to that question? If it wasn't for Ram and Allah, I would still have a D ) A bow and arrow.
JAMAL: D ) A bow and arrow.

MAMAN: Very good, very good. I am pleased, Arvind. He is ready.
ARVIND: Maman nods to Punnoose. Before Arvind can turn round, Punnoose has covered his mouth with a cloth and after the briefest of struggles, Arvind's body goes limp. The villager puts an old tin box on the table. Taking the lid from the tin, he brings out a cloth and unwraps it. Inside is a spoon. He checks the edge with his thumb. Sharp. Douses it with a clear liquid from a bottle and passes it over a candle flame. The spoon whooshes with a high flame for a moment. The villager wipes it with the cloth nods to Punnoose.
PUNNOOSE: ( CONTINUED )

TV REPORTER: ..behind the walls of this police station lies the mystery all of India is talking about. Did Jamal Malik, an uneducated, eighteen year-old boy from the slums of Mumbai win one Crore rupees by fair means or foul? And in the crowds all around me there is an even bigger question. Will he be back on the show tonight to play for twenty million rupees.
INSPECTOR: I- progress is being made sir.
INSPECTOR: No, Sir.
INSPECTOR: COMMISSIONER OF POLICE

Tonight, he can walk away with that in his pocket or make the biggest gamble in television history and go for the final question and a staggering twenty million rupees! Jamal, are you ready for that question?
JAMAL: The lights dim, the music rumbles. Prem pushes the button on his computer. Pauses. Gets conversational.
PREM: Big reader, are you Jamal? A lover of literature?
JAMAL: I can read.
PREM: Lucky! In Alexandre Dumas' book, The Three Musketeers, two of the musketeers are called Athos and Porthos. What was the name of the third musketeer. Was it A ) Aramis, B ) Cardinal Richelieu, C ) D'Artagnan, D ) Planchet.
PREM: The final question, for twenty million rupees: and he's smiling. I guess you know the Would you believe it? I don't. You don't? So, you're going to take the ten million and walk?
JAMAL: Would you believe it? I don't. You don't? So, you're going to take the ten million and walk?
PREM: You don't? So, you're going to take the ten million and walk?
JAMAL: I'll play.
PREM: I'll play.
JAMAL: I'll play.
PREM: You just said you don't know the answer. I heard that, right? You do understand that if you get the answer wrong, you lose everything? Ten million rupees. A fortune, Jamal.
JAMAL: I'd like to phone a friend.
PREM: We're going to the wire, Ladies and Gentlemen, we are going to the wire. The final Life-line. Here we go..
PREM: It's ringing.
PREM: Doesn't look as if your friend is in, Jamal. Who is it?
JAMAL: My brother's number, but-
PREM: - the sort of brother who'd go for a walk on the twenty million rupee question?
JAMAL: It's the only number I know.
PREM: You're on your own, Jamal.
PREM: Wow! That's cutting it fine. I'm guessing this isn't your brother. This is-
INSPECTOR: That's why he's on the show.
JAVED: What the bloody-?
PREM: Okay! So, Latika, you want to hear the question one more time? And let's be clear about this. Twenty million rupees ride on your answer. You have thirty seconds. Jamal, please read out the question to Latika.
JAMAL: Is that really you?
PREM: The question, Jamal.
JAMAL: In Alexandre Dumas' book, The Three Musketeers, two of the musketeers are called Athos and Porthos. What was the name of the third musketeer. Was it A ) Aramis, B ) Cardinal Richelieu, C ) D'Artagnan, D ) Planchet.

JAMAL: Latika? Latika?
SALIM: God is good.
INSPECTOR: Just one more thing left, Sir.
PREM: Finally, huh?
INSPECTOR: If you'd like to come with me.
JAMAL: Truth alone triumphs? I should have known better.
INSPECTOR: Thought you might need a lift,
JAMAL: Then she is gone in the melee again. Only to reappear.
LATIKA: Jamal forces himself through the people. Nothing will stop him. Latika too is shoving them aside until they are face-to-face. They stop, look at each other, hold each other's hands tight. The whole station seems frozen, the only movement from a thousand bodies being Jamal and Latika.
JAMAL: I knew you'd be watching.
