CHARLES' MOTHER: But he was never really a father.I don't think he ever.understood Joe.
CHARLES' FATHER: ( maybe a little concerned
HIMSELF ): Joe's gonna be okay. But his wife isn't so sure. Then, BOYS' HUSHED VOICES:
CARY: What do you think was in the Jesus, shut up.
MARTIN: Jesus, shut up.
CARY: I mean cause of how she died.
PRESTON: No, I'm eating macaroni salad. We now see CHARLES, big and in an ill-fitting BLACK SUIT, and MARTIN, good looking, in a shirt and tie, at the buffet:
CHARLES: I was thinking that, about the I don't know how you guys can eat.
MARTIN: I don't know how you guys can eat.
CHARLES: Try a Goddamn turkey roll and you'll discover how. They're CUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the year 1979. At a wake. Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly dressed. Quiet discussions. Some crying.
CARY: Either nothing was in there, or like whatever they scraped up
MARTIN: Jesus guys
CHARLES MARTIN: I heard it crushed her completely. At least keep your voices
DOWN: PRESTON CHARLES
PRESTON CHARLES: A steel beam those things weigh a ton. Literally. If it had been open casket, I They look up in the other room, a dog ( mutt, Lucy ) has jumped on a guest, for food. JACKSON LAMB, Joe's father, 42, black suit, moves to the dog, walks her out of shot.
CHARLES: Bet Joe's not gonna wanna do my movie anymore.
CARY: Why do you think why? The story. It's about the living dead.
CHARLES: Why do you think why? The story. It's about the living dead.
PRESTON: His mother's not a zombie.
CHARLES: But she's dead, shithead.
CARY: Those turkey rolls are pretty good.
CHARLES: Told you.
JACK: I'll be home soon. And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket again. Mom's just gone. Finally he CLOSES IT and we hear an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK. Over darkness: APPLAUSE then a LONE VOICE: "I want you. to want me!" DRUMS kick in, CHEAP TRICK BLASTS. CUT TO:
CHARLES: That was the longest day ever What's this?
JOE: What's this?
CHARLES: New scene, check it out. Let's hit the 7.
JOE: ( as he reads ) You hear Martin barfed in the hall?
CHARLES: I know, does that guy ever not barf? Keep reading.
JOE CHARLES: I am reading. Not carefully. Focus, this is important. Detective Hathaway has a I think it might help make my movie better. I need two things: a better story and production value. They head across the street to the 7-Eleven. Suddenly Cary is there, a BURN WRAP on his right arm now:
CARY CHARLES: Martin booted all over his locker, it was the grossest one yet Let Joe focus, he's reading.
CARY CHARLES: After he ate two boxes of Mike and Ikes never seen so many colors in my life. Will you shut up a minute?
JOE: Who's gonna play the wife, Jen?
CHARLES: No way did I tell you what she did with my top hat?
JOE: Oh yeah, that was bad.
CARY: What wife?
CHARLES: Alice Dainard. Joe stops. His friends don't. PUSH IN ON HIM
CHARLES: I was returning that book on codes and ciphers she was in the silent reading section I thought, "Screw it." So I asked her if she'd play Hathaway's wife.
JOE: You talked to Alice Dainard really?
CARY: You're not supposed to talk at all in the silent reading section
CHARLES CARY: Shut up. It's for "silent reading."
CHARLES: She said yes, we're filming tonight and she's driving.
JOE: driving where?
CHARLES JOE: To the train depot did you not read the scene I just gave you? Does Alice have a license? Is
CHARLES: Jesus, Freak Show, she offered to drive and I accepted
CARY: ( takes scene pages ) Can I see ?
JOE: was she nice? Why is she doing this? I don't understand, we don't even know her
CHARLES: Maybe she just wants to be in a good movie, y'ever think of that?
JOE: I don't think that's what it is
CHARLES: I've been working on this movie for months. I'm just trying to make it ( reading, disapproving ) Hathaway's married now? Really? Charles swipes the pages from critic Cary.
CARY: ( reading, disapproving ) Hathaway's married now? Really? Charles swipes the pages from critic Cary.
JOE: What was she reading?
CHARLES: . what?
JOE: In the silent reading section, what was Alice reading?
CHARLES: Who gives a rat's ass what she was reading the festival deadline's in one week my movie's gotta be CHARLES' SUPER 8 MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A MOVIE SCREEN. SLOWLY PUSH IN ON THE SCREEN: kids earnestly playing adults:
JACK: That was a good zombie murder.
CHARLES: Yeah, but it's not a st thank you for that it's not a story yet.
CHARLES: I'm coming!
JOE: ( looks at magazine ) I don't understand how the wife makes it a story
I'M COMING!!!: so when he investigates the zombie stuff you'll be scares you'll feel something because you don't want him to die because they love each other! Does that make sense?
CHARLES: You're impossible.
CHARLES!: GOD, MOM! I'M COMING! ( opens the door, whispers ) Midnight. Okay? Don't forget.
CHARLES: GOD, MOM! I'M COMING! ( opens the door, whispers ) Midnight. Okay? Don't forget.
JOE: I won't forget.
CHARLES: Read this. Joe just nods and looks at the magazine.
JEN: Mom, it's not fair that I can't go to Wendy's. Every single person is going except me!
CHARLES' MOTHER: Then every single person can tell you how it was
CHARLES' FATHER: Move the puzzle, get the napkins.
JEN: CHARLES' MOTHER
CHARLES' MOTHER: It's your turn to babysit.
JEN: Get off that thing.
PEG: Get off that thing.
JEN: Mom, why can't I switch with Because you crushed Charles' top hat, you ever think of that? Disgusted, Jen LOUDLY sets Charles' place as
CHARLES: Because you crushed Charles' top hat, you ever think of that? Disgusted, Jen LOUDLY sets Charles' place as
JEN: Oh, really, guess what? We're Charles grabs a roll.
CHARLES: Guess what, no we're not.
CHARLES' MOTHER: Charles take these to the table! Benji, it's time for dinner. Hey,
JOE: Goodnight, Mrs. Kaznyk
JOE: Goodnight, Mrs. Kaznyk
CHARLES' MOTHER: Grab a seat, we have lots of food.
JOE: Oh no thanks, Ma'am, I'm okay. ( to Charles, loaded ) "See you tomorrow."
CHARLES: Later days.
CHARLES' FATHER: There's always a place for you here, you know that
JOE: Oh, yessir. Thank you. Joe leaves; Charles' parents share a look of pity for Joe.
JACK: Hey I'll be out in a minute Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door. HOLD ON JOE. Stunned and heartsick.
JACK: It's a six-week program, hands-on training with college coaches.
JOE: I thought I was going to have the summer for myself
JACK: Things have obviously changed for us. And it'd be good for you to spend some time with kids who don't run around with cameras and
JOE: I gotta help Charles finish his I have nothing against your friends. I like your friends.
JACK: I have nothing against your friends. I like your friends.
JOE: I won't. Over. Joe turns off the walkie and he grabs a small plastic FISHERMAN'S TACKLE BOX as we HEAR:
CHARLES: I sneezed so hard yesterday I shit my pants.
JOE: That's called a "sharteeze" by the Well then I totally sharteezed in my pants. That's exactly what I'm talking about: the world is crazy, there's a name for Twizzler me. Joe passes him a Twizzler.
PRESTON: That's called a "sharteeze" by the Well then I totally sharteezed in my pants. That's exactly what I'm talking about: the world is crazy, there's a name for Twizzler me. Joe passes him a Twizzler.
CHARLES CARY: Well then I totally sharteezed in my pants. That's exactly what I'm Joe passes him a Twizzler.
CHARLES: Twizzler me. Joe passes him a Twizzler.
MARTIN: So. people are turning into zombies because of the chemical factory, right?
CHARLES: Martin? I don't see how the guy playing Detective Hathaway can ask where the zombies are coming from.
CARY: Another classic from Smartin.
MARTIN: I told you, I don't like it when you call me that.
CARY: I'm sorry, Smartin.
MARTIN: Shut up.
JOE: All the boys look. Their faces BRIGHTEN. Headlights. The boys stand as the car STOPS beside them IT'S THE YELLOW BUICK
GUYS: All the boys look. Their faces BRIGHTEN. Headlights. The boys stand as the car STOPS beside them IT'S THE YELLOW BUICK
ALICE: Joe Lamb?!
JOE: What the hell's he doing here?
ALICE: What the hell's he doing here?
CHARLES: Make-up, sound and special effects.
ALICE: He's the deputy's kid!
CHARLES JOE: what? ( touch flattered ) you knew that?
CHARLES: You want Joe to stay back? I?
ALICE: It's too late! He's seeing me in this car right now.
JOE: You can trust me. My dad'll never know. I won't tell him anything. Looking away, she's pissed. All the boys in silent wait. She considers, annoyed. Shakes her head. Finally:
ALICE: Get in. The boys EXCITEDLY SCRAMBLE into the car.
CHARLES: So I wrote a couple new lines, can I show you?
ALICE: New lines? Charles what, I have new lines?
MARTIN: New lines? Charles what, I have new lines?
CHARLES: Shut up. There aren't a lot
ALICE: I'm sorta trying to drive
CHARLES: What would be great is: could you cry during the scene? Can you do . no.?! Cary messes with the radio. Alice moves his hand away.
ALICE: . no.?! Cary messes with the radio. Alice moves his hand away.
CARY: You know the first place I'm gonna drive when I get my license?
JOE: ( offering to Alice ) Want one? Alice looks at him in the rear view. Their eyes hold a beat.
CARY: New Castle, Pennsylvania. Fireworks capital of America. She takes the Twizzler he offers and looks back to the road.
MARTIN: So I don't have any new lines, right? Because I just learned Shut up.
CHARLES: Shut up.
PRESTON: I have never been a passenger in a vehicle without an adult driving. I'm unresolved as to how I feel about it.
CHARLES: Guys, there's an electrical socket up here.
MARTIN: Hey, Charles, Charles, do I have more lines?
CHARLES: No. But you can pick up some stuff. The boys carry many bags and the tripod. PLATFORM - Charles looks at the scene through the "lens" he creates with both hands.
JOE: Joe walks past Alive, who watches him. It strikes her that Joe is Charles' lackey.
MARTIN: " Sweetheart, this is my job, I have no choice." "That's nothing you need to worry about." "What am I suppose to go to Michigan with Cary grabs his paper and throws it to the wind, sending Martin running after it.
CARY: I took apart two packs of cherry bombs and made my own M-80.
PRESTON: Your obsession with fireworks and I'm saying this as a friend concerns me. And my mother.
CARY: Well you're a pussy. And your mom has one. Cary takes off. Martin returns with his paper.
MARTIN: Bogus, Cary.
CHARLES: Martin, I have a new line for you. He gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice. He walks over to Martin, Cary and Preston. Charles and Martin AD LIB. TIGHT ON JOE'S TACKLE BOX, which opens. Inside is an assortment of MAKE-UPS, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of FAKE BLOOD. Joe is preparing to make up Alice, who sits in front of him, watching carefully as Joe prepares BASE MAKE-UP on a sponge. He looks to her. A beat.
JOE: You mind? Alice shakes her head: nope. Joe starts stippling the make-up onto her face. He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a girl he's admired for some time. After a beat:
ALICE: My dad works at the mill. And she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too much for him to bear.
JOE: Close you eyes. Please. He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does. Joe starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes closed. Then, PRE-LAP:
CHARLES: Alice: Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't want her husband to keep investiga
ALICE: I know, we read it, we get it.
CHARLES: Okay, I'm just directing. Martin get on your mark. Martin, you're going to have to reassure her. Do you know what "reassure her" means?
MARTIN: Yeah, I think so.
CHARLES: Okay we're starting on Alice's side first Preston: a couple seconds after "action" walk to the pay phone, make it look like this place is busy
PRESTON: I know what that looks like. POP! Everyone JUMPS Charles turns Cary, laughing, has just exploded a firecracker:
CHARLES: Asshole, could you stop blowing shit up for two seconds and deal with the camera?
CARY: Sorry man.
CHARLES: Let's rehearse this save your real performances for when we're filming, though. Martin and Alice put away their pages Cary gets behind the camera. Charles stands near the camera, kneeling to camera- height. Joe wears headphones and holds the boom over the actors' heads. Preston holds a suitcase, ready to walk.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: I'm going to stay here and investigate. I think it would be safer if you leave town.
MRS. HATHAWAY: John. I don't like it. This case. These murders.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you? Preston walks past them, acting in the background.
MRS. HATHAWAY: Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year. We're TIGHT ON JOE NOW, watching Alice. Slowly amazed at the unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: Sweetheart. This is my job.
MRS. HATHAWAY: The dead, coming back to life.? I think you're in danger
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: I have no choice
MRS. HATHAWAY: You do have a choice. We all do. And holy shit, Alice actually starts to cry as she performs her lines. Not overdone, not hammy. Just fucking real.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: . I. I love you too. And in the heat of it, Alice looks at Charles, unsure:
ALICE: Was that okay? Or. not really? Charles is stunned almost crying can't talk and as he searches, behind him, a LIGHT
CHARLES: uh, that was. I'm. that yeah, good. Just like that. Then a distant AIRHORN Charles looks: AN ONCOMING TRAIN. PUSH IN ON CHARLES, TIGHT. He turns to them all:
CARY: I didn't put it in
CHARLES: PUT IT IN!!! PUT IT IN!!! Joe, get the mike ready. Go, go, Preston, get in position. Costume, costume. Martin, get that tripod set up. Joe, help her with her costume. Hurry, hurry! Go! I hope we don't miss the train. Preston, get in position! Martin, you know you lines, right?! IS THE FILM IN THE
CAMERA YET?!: As Charles runs to Alice, takes her script pages.
ALICE: I love how calm he is.
JOE: Yeah, he's a very relaxed guy.
CHARLES: Everyone ready.?! Be extra loud when the train passes by! Oh God, I hope it stops! You ready?! They're set to film toward Alice, the approaching train in her background Charles puts on the headphones
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: I'm going to stay here and investigate. I think it would be safer if you left town for a couple of days.
MRS. HATHAWAY: John. I don't like it. This case. These murders.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you?
MRS. HATHAWAY: Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: Sweetheart. This is my job. Charles watches, beaming with excitement. Joe holds the boom, looks to Charles to make sure it sounds okay; this is when he notices something in the distance. HEADLIGHTS. A quarter mile away, a vehicle drives along the horizon. A beat. But the train is APPROACHING GETTING LOUDER which makes Joe turn back toward the train the thing almost upon them LOUDER AND LOUDER, so the actors begin to YELL over the
MRS. HATHAWAY: THE DEAD, COMING BACK TO LIFE?! I THINK YOU'RE IN DANGER! I HAVE NO CHOICE!!! MRS. HATHAWAY YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE! WE ALL DO!!! John, I've never asked you to stop. I've never asked you to give up or walk away. Joe looks back at the headlights and sees something very odd: the distant vehicle TURNS ONTO THE TRACKS. PUSH IN ON JOE, unsettled as the train CROSSES THEM NOW Joe looks back toward Alice a BLAST OF AIR, shockingly LOUD!
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: I HAVE NO CHOICE!!! MRS. HATHAWAY YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE! WE ALL DO!!! John, I've never asked you to stop. I've never asked you to give up or walk away.

PUSH IN ON JOE, unsettled as the train CROSSES THEM NOW Joe looks back toward Alice a BLAST OF AIR, shockingly LOUD!
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: I love you too!! And Joe finally swings the mike down and YELLS:
JOE CHARLES: GUYS, WATCH OUT!!! Joe what the hell are y?! just then BA-BA-BA-BAM!!! THE TRAIN ENGINE, HUNDREDS OF
JOE: THE TRAIN BEGINS TO CRASH ACCORDION THE KIDS SCREAM RUN ENTIRE 50-TON CARS JACKNIFE AND CRASH UPWARD FLYING VERTICAL CHARLES' SUPER 8 CAMERA AND TRIPOD SLAM ONTO THE PLATFORM, LANDING SIDEWAYS, STILL FILMING as the CRASH WAVE
CHARLES: Joe, we have to go.
PRESTON: I'm okay! Though I think I'm having a heart attack! And I have a Joe MOVES FORWARD up to camera behind him, Cary appears, smiling. This kid enjoyed the crash:
CARY: Guys, did you see those explosions? That was awesome.
JOE: Has anyone seen Alice?!
MARTIN CARY: what? Guys, what is it? . shit. Joe moves closer to the blood heartsick on the verge of DEEP, REAL TEARS everything stops but then:
JOE: It's my fake blood. It's fake!
CHARLES: What is this stuff?
PRESTON: Guys, what are these things? Joe looks they all move to Preston ( except Cary, who heads off ): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES which now litter the ground. Joe kneels, picks one up:
MARTIN: Hey, don't touch it, what are you They look like white Rubik's cubes or something. They're heavy like metal or something. There's like a billion of them. It's just a few inches per side, an UNUSUAL DESIGN. Behind them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train cars, Cary calls out:
CHARLES: They look like white Rubik's cubes or something. They're heavy like metal or something. There's like a billion of them. It's just a few inches per side, an UNUSUAL DESIGN. Behind them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train cars, Cary calls out:
CARY: Guys, get up here. You can see everything from up here. They move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE WRECK. It seems to stretch on forever. It is SOBERING.
CHARLES CARY: Oh my God. . Look at that.
PRESTON: According to my Uncle Seth, an accident like this is exceptionally It wasn't an accident. ( turns away, eyes on the
JOE: It wasn't an accident. ( turns away, eyes on the
FIELD ): There was a truck. On the tracks.
CHARLES: What? Driving on the tracks? Joe's seen it. He points. Chilled.
JOE: Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is THE PICK-UP TRUCK. SHEARED IN HALF UPON IMPACT and lying in the overgrown
MARTIN: How can a pick-up truck derail a train? That's impossible.
PRESTON: Obviously it isn't. BOOM UP from behind the SHATTERED PICK-UP as the kids approach from the wreckage. PUSH IN ON THEM as they arrive at the truck and STOP; what they see makes Joe's heart pound they're stunned all of them. They just stop. Finally:
CARY: . holy shit.
CHARLES: is that him?
ALICE: ( covers her mouth ) ) yeah, it's him
MARTIN: PRESTON CHARLES
PRESTON CHARLES: It is, yeah, for sure Holy shit.
ALICE: Dr. Woodward.? No one can take their eyes off this as, SOTTO:
MARTIN: That's Dr. Woodward? The science Honors biology.
PRESTON: Honors biology.
CARY: Honors biology.
MARTIN: Wow. I'm not in his class.
CARY: We know.
MARTIN: Shut up, Cary.
CHARLES: Remember when Old Man Woodward took your Electronic Football?
CARY: Yeah, he put it in the "dungeon," never gave it back.
MARTIN: The dungeon?
PRESTON: That trailer Woodward keeps in the school parking lot. Joe moves next to Alice, who reaches out and gently NUDGES him you keep expecting him to suddenly grab her
ALICE: . Dr. Woodward? But he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he LEANS, his arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was HOLDING A PAPER, that has now fallen onto the ground. Joe picks it up. UNFOLDS IT: it's an OLD MAP thin, off-white paper. They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Woodward. We see MARKER WRITING ON IT a BLACK LINE, from Nevada to Dayton and NUMBERS written along the way.
PRESTON JOE: Map of the contiguous United States. what's the writing?
JOE: It's a schedule for the train. But a SHADOW has appeared: A TREMBLING HAND before they can react, it RIPS THE MAP AWAY THEY ALL SCREAM AS OLD DR. WOODWARD IS REVEALED, BLOODY EYES OPEN, in a DAZE:
DR. WOODWARD: who who are you?
CHARLES: Dr. Woodward! It's Charles Kaznyk! From fourth period! You've been in an accident!
DR. WOODWARD: They will kill you. Do not speak of this or you and your parents - - will die. We're on Joe's stunned face but DISTANT VOICES make him turn his head: hundreds of yards away, through the wreck,
JOE: guys, look The rest turn to look their minds are racing, all of them:
ALICE: ( SCARED )
DR. WOODWARD: The kids start moving away
GOOOOOOOOO!!!: The kids start moving away
PRESTON CHARLES: My dad will de-ball me! Let's get out of here!!! Now they're SPRINTING FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer. Charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera. Alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse she eyes the FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer:
ALICE: MOVE YOUR ASS, WE GOTTA GO!!! Joe grabs his make-up kit another duffel runs for the car, past a whining Charles.
JOE: GET IN THE CAR!!! As the FLASHLIGHT MEN APPROACH, Joe runs and gets in the front seat, the other boys in back Alice SLAMS the car into REVERSE, SCREECH-BACKS UP, narrowly avoids debris, then RIDES OFF the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive SOLDIERS their adrenaline pumping. One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA, eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: COLONEL NELEC. He then looks to the ground in front of him. CLOSE ON A FRESH, EMPTY YELLOW SUPER 8 FILM BOX. Nelec steps to it, picks it up. Looks at it. Then back up at the disappearing car. We PUSH IN ON HIS BURNING EYES AND
CHARLES PRESTON: Holy shit, that was insane! He had a gun! An actual
CARY CHARLES: I can't believe all that just happened here! Nothing ever My whole camera lends is like happens here!!! shattered now!
PRESTON: My heart is pounding! That train could of killed us.

MARTIN: I HAVE NEVER HAD A TEACHER AIM A GUN AT ME! It's hard enough to drive without everyone yelling!
ALICE: It's hard enough to drive without everyone yelling!
JOE: Guys, keep it down!
CARY JOE: Joe: what was Woodward talking about? I don't know, I don't know
MARTIN: I'm never taking a train again.
PRESTON: "You'll die, your parents will die," guys, that is not good Great, the focus ring just fell No one cares about your CAMERA!
CHARLES: Great, the focus ring just fell No one cares about your CAMERA!
CARY: No one cares about your CAMERA!
MARTIN: Am I the only one shaking?! I'm also crying
ALICE: We can't tell anyone we were there - - we can't say a thing about it my dad cannot find out I took his car, do you guys hear me?!
JOE: It's okay no one's saying anything. None of us. ( to his friends ) Guys we're not gonna say anything are we?! The boys all muster, "no's." Joe turns sweetly to Alice.
ALICE: Joe, this is yours. Joe goes to the window. Alice holds it out: THE CUBE. He takes it with:
JOE: oh, thanks,
ALICE: I should never have done this. She just drives away. Left there are Joe, Charles, Preston, Cary and Martin. They all kind of look at Alice go.
JACK JOE: Gotta head in early okay Make sure you let Lucy out. I will Pull back WIDE to see Joe's room while in the FOREGROUND is his desk, crowded with stuff. In focus, however, is the CUBED OBJECT he took from the crash site. As the shot progresses, you may notice that THE CUBE HAS CHANGED SHAPE;
JACK JOE: You gonna what, you with Charles today? Yeah, I'll be with Charles Make sure you get the yard. okay, I will. Jack heads off.
JEN: Mom, come on!

JOE: Morning, Mr. Kaznyk
CHARLES' MOTHER: Hi, Joe. Did you hear about the train accident?
JOE: Uh. no.
CHARLES' MOTHER: It's on the news. Joe is moving toward the living room, where Charles sits on the sofa, eyes glued to the TV, A TRAIN CRASH BEING REPORTED ON THE LOCAL NEWS; HELICOPTER SHOT of the wreck. The CHYRON READS, "TRAIN DERAILED - AIR FORCE AIDS CLEAN UP." Joe sits beside Charles. They both watch, stunned, as a PHOTO OF DR. WOODWARD appears on the TV, with the heading "DRIVER OF TRUCK

JOE: It's on the news. That means it's NEWS REPORTER ( V.O. ) Meanwhile, local science teacher Thomas Woodward is still being treated by Air Force medical personnel after last night's train derailment.

JOE: You totally did, that's true, I know, but
ALICE: And now you're at my house.
JOE: I am, which under normal conditions I would nev
ALICE: It's too weird after last night I don't understand how you guys can keep working on your stupid movie, I really don't.
JOE: We have to while the crash is still there. ( waits, anxious, then,
ALICE: ( she considers, then: ) But Alice's eyes have flicked to the Buick, pulling up.
LOUIS: What's this?
ALICE: He was just inviting me to a party. Joe steps back as Louis arrives; Louis seems to hate Joe, but at the same time, can barely look at him:
LOUIS: She's not going to your party.
JOE: Louis throws Alice a dark, resentful glare.
LOUIS: You know better than this. She nods, uncomfortable. Louis turns to Joe:
ALIE: I'll do it.
JOE: She closes the door. Alone, despite it all, Joe is happy. Off his smile, we HEAR LOUD POPS: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!
CHARLES: CUT! That was mint! So good! And it looked huge with the train! Wow! Joe: go reload the cap gun!
JOE: WIDE SHOT, rising PAST SIX BICYCLES, thrown to the ground in a typical kid jumble. Charles, Joe and Preston, with Joe's dad's KODAK CAMERA on tripod, have been filming, their gear scattered. KEEP MOVING OVER THEM, to Martin and Alice, who were on camera. Beyond them, in the valley, the TRAIN CRASH seems to go forever. MILITARY TRUCKS, TENTS and SOLDIERS. HELICOPTERS buzz in the distant sky. Joe moves over to Alice, who looks out at the crash. During all this:
OKAY: WIDE SHOT, rising PAST SIX BICYCLES, thrown to the ground in a typical kid jumble. Charles, Joe and Preston, with Joe's dad's KODAK CAMERA on tripod, have been filming, their gear scattered. KEEP MOVING OVER THEM, to Martin and Alice, who were on camera. Beyond them, in the valley, the TRAIN CRASH seems to go forever. MILITARY TRUCKS, TENTS and SOLDIERS.

CHARLES: We'll get the other direction next - - Alice, that was mint Martin, go a little faster next time.
MARTIN: I'll try, but I'm still crying about last night, I feel like I'm Cary sits, pulls off the CUT-OUT PING PONG BALLS that were covering his closed eyes.
CARY: Did it really look good? My death? CLOSE ON JOE as he arrives beside Alice, who looks out at the train, haunted. Quiet:
ALICE: . what do you think happened.? Joe stops reloading the gun, looks out, gets lost as well.
JOE: You mean why he crashed the train?
ALICE: I just got a horrible feeling. Martin has arrives there too. Preston too:
MARTIN: Anyone else still shaking from the I got in my parents' bed last night. Haven't done that since I was eleven. Joe suddenly WALKS AWAY FROM THEM, back toward the camera.
PRESTON: I got in my parents' bed last night. Haven't done that since I was eleven. Joe suddenly WALKS AWAY FROM THEM, back toward the camera.
CHARLES: dude, what are you doing? Joe moves the camera back to Alice he looks through the lens uses the ZOOM and WE SEE JOE'S POV the CRASH, ZOOMED IN he PANS from ONE CAR TO ANOTHER. Alice watches Joe, who peers into the camera for a long beat, finally standing up, looking out at the crash:
JOE: That whole thing's an Air Force INT. DINER - DAY The kids sit at a table at the window. The CAR LOT is across the street. They're talking excitedly but quietly:
ALICE: INT. DINER - DAY The kids sit at a table at the window. The CAR LOT is across the street. They're talking excitedly but quietly:
JOE: I make models plastic ones you know, glue `em, paint `em
PRESTON: And he's not embarrassed by that.
CARY: Looks who's talking, Math Camp. A WAITRESS is there, delivering more FOOD
CHARLES: Thanks, could I have a coffee, please? Cream on the side?
WAITRESS: ( really? ) She heads off. Cary smiles at Alice.
CARY: He is so sophisticated.
CHARLES CARY: Shut up, I like coffee. No one likes coffee.
ALICE: Keep going.
JOE: Air Force trains even models have these hooks.
PRESTON: Ooo! Ooo ooo ooo! They do for when their train cars are put on transport ships.
JOE: Every car in that crash had hooks, every one.
CHARLES: Joe: stop talking about it.
MARTIN: Am I the only one who doesn't understand what this all means?
CARY: Probably, Smartin.
MARTIN: Shut up, I don't like that
JOE PRESTON: Dr. Woodward had that map. He drove onto the tracks. Maybe there was something he wanted to destroy, he wanted to destroy? yeah.
CHARLES: Please shut up, all of you.
CARY: I say he was just sick of being old and wanted to kill himself.
JOE: He had a gun, why not use that?
PRESTON: There are infinitely more effective ways to commit suicide: pills,
HANGING: CARY CHARLES PRESTON ( CONT'D )
CARY CHARLES: Pussy, stop pulling the fries away. I ordered these for a reason. he gets all possessive with his fries, it's so
MARTIN: Fall down stairs.
PRESTON: Well, that's not really effective.
ALICE: So, if it's Air Force, what would the Air Force have on a train?
CHARLES: ( WHISPER YELLING )
PRESTON: Drowning, hari kari, also known as Excuse me, could we please get another order of fries because my friend here is fat?
CARY: Excuse me, could we please get another order of fries because my friend here is fat?
CHARLES: Funny, Chompers, at least I don't use a booster seat.
MARTIN: What was your teacher even talking about? Who are we supposed to be afraid of anyway?
CHARLES: I don't wanna find out guys, we gotta forget we were there. Joe, seriously. you really wanna take a chance that something could happen to your dad, too? This lands for Joe for all of them as we CUT TO:
NELEC: Yes, I understand, this crash has caused a whole mess of confusion.
JACK: As you can expect, the local authorities are trying to figure out just what happened here as well as how to help you out.
NELEC: It's under control. It'll be a very fast clean-up.
JACK: Colonel, there isn't anything I should know, is there?
NELEC: Not that I can think of, Deputy. I understand you have concerns about our cargo.
JACK: I'd like to see that manifest, yes.
NELEC: That's not going to be possible.
JACK: Colonel, I've got a lot of people in my town that are gonna want to know what's taking place.
NELEC: what town is that?
JACK: . Lillian.
NELEC: Deputy, if you're asking me if we had any dangerous property on board this train, I can assure you the answer's no.
OVERMYER: Excuse me. Jack looks at Nelec not quite believing him.
NELEC: Excuse me. Jack looks at Nelec not quite believing him.
JACK: They gave me the run around for two hours before I was allowed to talk to anyone.
PRUITT: I'd say they have their hands full, wouldn't you?
JACK: Nelec the Colonel refused to show me their manifest, said they were carrying mostly airplane parts-
PRUITT: It's Air Force, Jack. Airplane parts sorta make sense.
JACK: Sheriff, I'm telling you, there's something else going on they're taking molds of tire tracks now why would they be doing that? Who are they looking for? And they're packing these weird little cubes into crates and they're
PRUITT: Weird little cubes?
JACK: yeah, into these red trucks, dozens of these trucks and I'm telling you, they're scrambling to get the hell outta there
PRUITT: I'd say that's a good thing, wouldn't you?
JACK: Sheriff, I think you need to go check it out.
PRESTON: And I think you need a break.
SHERIFF PRUITT: Hey Breen, I'm not sure Edie's paying you to listen to the radio. Breen doesn't respond. The sheriff throws a candy bar at him.
BREEN: Hey, Sheriff.
SHERIFF PRUITT: What's that?
BREEN: Walkman. It's like a stereo, play your own cassette tapes.
SHERIFF PRUITT: ( pays for the candy bars ) I don't think so. Kids walking around with their own stereos. Just what we need. It's a slippery He exits the store.
BREEN: . yessir. Pruitt heads out; Breen puts the headphones on again.
GUN, BUT: INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT Breen, eyes closed, blasts his Walkman ( we only hear TINNY MUSIC ) as, through the window behind him, the rear of the squad car SUDDENLY SPRINGS UPWARD VIOLENTLY as if the FRONT SECTION WAS SUDDENLY CRUSHED! PRUITT SCREAMS, MUFFLED, as the CAR SLAMS back to the pavement LIGHTS FLICKER
CONFOUNDING: INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT PRUITT'S SCREAMS END as Breen OPENS HIS EYES AND RIPS off the headphones: the hell was that? He looks outside sees the car shattered windows. Confused, he heads out
ALICE: Where'd you learn how to do this?
JOE: Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make- up Handbook. She nods. Whatever. Charles is suddenly there, with Cary:
CHARLES: Hey! So I'm gonna need more shots of the train crash, obviously you know that train model you made? Can we blow it up and film it? Joe doesn't want to do this at all. AT ALL. But.
JOE: . sure.
CHARLES CARY: Mint. Gnarly! Charles and Cary head off, planning the explosions. Alice looks at him knowingly.
CHARLES MARTIN: That's like the third time Dude. Bitchen. that's happened.
ALICE: So how am I supposed to be a Oh. Just be a lifeless ghoul. Someone with no soul, dead eyes. Scary. D'you ever have Mrs. Mullin?
JOE: Oh. Just be a lifeless ghoul. Someone with no soul, dead eyes. Scary. D'you ever have Mrs. Mullin?
ALICE: For English? Yeah
JOE: like her. But hungry, like hungry for human flesh. To make them turn into zombies, because that's what zombies do. Alice considers this then, after a beat, starts doing her best zombie. Joe smiles, `cause it's pretty good.
EDIE: Careful, there was a gas spill. I don't even know how much fuel I've lost.
MR. BLAKELY: You don't seem to be asking a lot of questions.
EDIE: Give this man some time, Mr. MR. BLAKELY He's just the Deputy, he's not the Jack kneels by the Smith and Wesson Model 19. Jack pulls out a handkerchief, lifts the fun PUSH IN ON the engraved initials "H.P." JACK IS ROCKED BY THIS. He opens the cylinder to check if it had been fired. CUT BACK WIDE. No squad car here. Jack checks out the broken BLUE AND RED PLASTIC as he makes a walkie call:

EDIE: Remember when I said you talk too much? Well, this is the time.
JACK: Vicky, ya heard from Sheriff Pruitt this morning?
JACK: Vicky, I need you to have Dayton send a CS unit out to Edie's. You put out an APB on the Sheriff and Breen Haskell send units to their houses immediately. You copy all of that?
JACK: . what kind of unusual calls.?
IZZY: Never seen this kinda thing before. Izzy opens ANOTHER CAR HOOD: PIECES MISSING.
JACK: Having trouble with anyone lately, I was thinking, you should talk to Louis Dainard. I didn't help him out with financing last year, wouldn't be surprised if this was some sorta sick retribution. As Jack heads back to his car, THREE RESIDENTS move to him, walk with him, AD LIB:

RESIDENTS JACK: Some strange shit has been d'you call the station going on. My antenna's gone yet. You need to call the our dog is gone, he hasn't station. And file a report, come home this morning before anything can be done Jack, my lights keep going on about it. And then we can and off. Counting on you, take care of these things. If Jack. you do that for me, I promise you, I'll handle it myself. He seems to have appeased them but as he turns, we see how stressed he is. He stops, noticing FOUR MILITARY TRUCKS DRIVING PAST, SLOWLY, ANTENNAS atop the trucks, and the men inside seemingly scanning the area. Jack is disturbed by EXT. HILL TOP Joe rides along a hillside. Parks his bike. Walks toward the Lucy. Lucy. Lucy! He stops to reveal the town of Lillian.
JOE: Lucy. Lucy. Lucy! He stops to reveal the town of Lillian.
JOE: Lucy! . Lucy! WIDE SHOT as he DIPS down a neighborhood hill, sun LOW.
OFFICER MIKE: We need more help around here.
OFFICER GORDON: We've got four men on the Pruitt case alone. We've called into Dayton, they'll be out in the
MORNING: That's not enough. People don't feel safe here and you know why? `Cause they're not The officers agree. Joe moves into the doorway where his dad and other convene.
JACK: That's not enough. People don't feel safe here and you know why? `Cause they're not The officers agree. Joe moves into the doorway where his dad and other convene.
SOMETHING: They've got trucks all over town.
OFFICER: They've got trucks all over town.
OFFICER JAY: I saw a guy riding shotgun in one of those trucks had some kind of scanner in his hand
DEPUTY TALLY: like a Geiger counter or
SOMETHING: I know. They're saying it's just clean-up at the train crash, but they're taking molds of tire tracks. Which means they're looking for someone now what's that Joe has heard this and DROPPED HIS FLASHLIGHT the men all turn, silent. Joe, on the spot:

JACK: I'm sure she's around. I put a couple of slices in the fridge for you there.
DEPUTY TALLY: oh I ate those. Sorry, Kid
JOE: That's. okay, I'll find a Then the POWER GOES OUT the men react it FLICKERS ON AND OFF Jack grabs his radio a the POWER RETURNS:
JACK: Vicky, you got power at the DISPATCH ( V.O. ) On and off. Brook County's in the Get water and power out there now.
JACK: Get water and power out there now.
JOE: So the Air Force is looking for a car Alice's dad's car they're taking tire prints from the crash site. Over.
CHARLES: I don't wanna hear about it. They could be monitoring us right now! Jesus, shut up. Over!
JOE: ( VERY CONCERNED )
CHARLES: Joe YOU CAN NOT FLAKE OUT ON ME AND BE A DICK! Are you gonna come help me tomorrow or not? I need you to make Alice a zombie again. And Joe tries to snap himself out of it. But is disturbed.
JOE: Okay. I'll do the make-up. Over.
ROONEY: This is Rooney at Mary-10, was there re-routing on this line?
ROONEY: . yeah, `cause there's no overhead lines on these poles.
ROONEY: No power, no comm cables. Stand by. He DRIVES AGAIN we see a WIDE SHOT OF THE LANDSCAPE
ROONEY: We got over a half mile of copper VOICE ( V.O. )
ROONEY: Lines are back up at M-38. In the cherry picker bucket, Rooney works the controls. He begins LIFTING; a WIDE SHOT shows him rising to the bare utility pole STEPDOWN TRANSFORMER. When Rooney finally gets to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer. After a moment, though, he stops. HEARS something else, past the sound of electricity. He looks over toward the SALVAGE YARD. Except it's mostly hidden by the trees. From here, Rooney can only see the tops of the JUNK PILES. A small METALLIC CRASH. Then ANOTHER.
MRS. BABBIT: Twenty microwave ovens: gone from my inventory. Brook County's without power this feels to me like a Russian invasion. The town ROARS its approval Jack, impotent, tries:
JACK: Mrs. Babbit, I don't believe the Russians have anything to do with what's happening in town but I'm calling the curfew because w
MRS. BABBIT: Until you can tell me who's messing with us, I say it's the Soviets and we're at war. I like you, Jack, but we need Sheriff Pruitt back. The town ERUPTS in agreement
JACK: We have good people working on that. Mr. McCandless. A short, bald man of 65, MR. MCCANDLESS speaks:
MR. MCCANDLESS: Since Wednesday morning, my Ham radio's been a mess all sorts of frequencies I like to scan. Some kind of buzz modulation have you found that?
JACK: Mr. McCandless, can I speak with you for a moment, privately? The Mayor takes over as Jack has a SIDEBAR MEETING with Mr.
WOMAN: Jack, all the tools in the garage are gone.
JACK: Patty, get in touch with Vicky. David, have you seen Milner?
DAVID: No, sir, I haven't seen him.
MAN: There's a sink hole in my garage. It almost sank a foot.
JACK: Hey Tom. Tom, have you seen Milner?
TOM: Have you tried his office?
JACK: Check his office.
MAN: The powers been out for days Jack continues, into:
JACK: Rosko, I need you to get every radio we have and you tune to these frequencies understand?
ROSKO: No. What?
JACK: Hey Danny, you have a radio scanner with a descrambler don't you?
DANNY: Voice inverter, yeah.
JACK: Whatever, get it down and set it up for me.
ROSKO: What is this?
JACK: I think the Air Force is using
UNASSIGNED CHANNELS: He heads for his office, seeing LOUIS, who is being escorted out by an Officer across the room.
LOUIS: Hey he was at my house yesterday morning, are you aware of that?
OFFICER ROSKO: ( quiet to Jack ) We brought him in about the car lot and other things he's clean.
LOUIS: I'd appreciate it if you would inform your son that my house if off-limits. And so it my daughter. Louis heads out HOLD ON JACK AS he turns, ENTERS HIS OFFICE, and as that door opens, we CUT TO:
JOE: Oh gawd, I didn't clean up. Joe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to the floor; NOTEBOOKS AND SCHOOL WORK spill out and we get a GLIMPSE of some "B-MINUSES" and other "C-PLUSES" in RED. Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS:
ALICE: you made all these?
JOE: Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I watched that one on TV.
ALICE: . it looks real. ( beat, studies ) It looks so old.
JOE: That's dry brush technique. ( off her look ) After you've painted the base color, you take something like. ( grabs up Testors bottle ) Euro Gray. Her face is so close to his. Her hair touches his ear.
ALICE: Euro Gray.
JOE: There are so many different grays, it's crazy. And you pour a little onto like a paper plate. Then you take a dry brush and you just dip it in, then you brush on the paper, so the paint's barely on the brush. Then you make small brush strokes on the model. Little ones, like where the wear and tear would be. Around the wheels. Or where the doors would slide. Then you do it again, like with Camouflage Gray or here, I used Insignia Red to make it look like there was another coat of paint on there before. Like they painted over it, but you could see it scratched off. Lost in thought, he looks at her. Suddenly self-conscious.
ALICE: What was that necklace? ( off his awkward stare ) The one you were holding at the train crash. Was it your mom's? It takes him a beat. Finally:
JOE: My dad gave it to her the day I was born. She wears it all the time. Used to.
CHARLES: Guys, what the hell?! No one knew where you were.
JOE: We're sitting right here.
CHARLES: You gotta be the soldier.
JOE: I thought you were calling Evan.
CHARLES: Evan blew us off, he's a pussy.
ALICE: It's okay.
CHARLES: You gotta do it. You're the only INT. POLICE STATION - JACK'S OFFICE - DAY Jack with OFFICER TALLY ( 24 ):
JACK: The hell do you mean you "found my dog in Brookville?" That's a
DIFFERENT COUNTY: OFFICER TALLY
OFFICER TALLY: Lucy that's where she is. We've gotten nearly thirty calls from people who have found local dogs. Thing is, the calls coming in aren't local. Tally puts a MAP on his desk 28 DOTS in a CIRCLE, anywhere from a 20 to 150 MILE RADIUS, WITH LILLIAN AT THE CENTER.
YOUNG WOMAN: It's not her. She never's disappeared before.
OFFICER ROSKO: Alright. Now what does she look She's got dark hair, it was in rollers. Do you know what rollers Yes, I know what rollers are.
YOUNG WOMAN: She's got dark hair, it was in rollers. Do you know what rollers Yes, I know what rollers are.
OFFICER ROSKO: Yes, I know what rollers are.
YOUNG WOMAN: She went to her car Suddenly a GARBLED ELECTRONIC SOUND from the HAM RADIO. Rosko quickly hits RECORD on the reel-to-reel
OFFICER ROSKO: EXCUSE ME
EXCUSE ME: He grabs speaker, turns the volume knob, puts the speaker close to the tape recorder, turns on recorder.
ROSKO: What's he say? Operation what?
JACK: Walking Distance.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: I came as soon as I could, what's happening here?
OFFICER JOE: Military police investigation. It was a suicide.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: Suicide? Who was it?
OFFICER JOE: A former Air Force officer. He called me last night, said he had a secret that he couldn't keep any Officer Joe hands Hathaway a FILE. Hathaway looks at it.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: What's this?
OFFICER JOE: He worked at Romero Chemical. He found out some things the company's been doing. After what you told me at the bar, I thought you should Cary behind the camera, Charles beside him:
CARY: ( QUIETLY )
CHARLES: ( WHISPER-YELL )
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: This proves it. They knew, the company knew. Thank you so much for the information.
OFFICER JOE: We just made the discovery ourselves. You understand this is top secret.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: Of course.
OFFICER JOE: I would never have given you this information if you and I hadn't served together in Vietnam. As it continues, we see Alice behind the camera, watching Joe, smiling. But then she sees something that disturbs her: Jack's CRUISER pulls up.
OVERMYER: Nothing so far
NELEC: How much more is there?
OVERMYER: Sixty boxes in the basement, maybe What, more tax returns?
NELEC: What, more tax returns?
OVERMYER: It's here somewhere. If we can't find it, Woodward'll tell us where it is. But Nelec has seen something outside: THE KIDS.
NELEC: . the hell's that?
OVERMYER: . looks like kids making a Behind them, a WINDOW, showing the street, where Jack insists Joe get into the car. Nelec looks out sees Jack take Joe by the arm, grab the tripod and head to his squad car.
CHARLES: ( TO JACK )
JACK: Get in the car. Joe is stunned instantly humiliated in front of Alice he's taken back to the squad car
CHARLES: Uh Mr. Lamb? That's your camera, but technically, that's my film
NELEC: I would like to help you out deputy. I really would. But we operate on a need to know basis.
JACK: Why are your trucks sweeping the We'll be out of your way shortly.
NELEC: We'll be out of your way shortly.
JACK: Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind me contacting DC. Talk to some friends about "Walking Distance." This lands on Nelec.
NELEC: ( JACK TURNS )
JACK: This is new. All this. For the both of us. Dealing with all this, just us. So I'm going to make this as clear and simple as I can: You're not friends with Alice Dainard. When I say no, I don't mean maybe. I don't mean yes. I mean no. I've known Louis Dainard for alotta years he's been nothing but trouble. Your mother used to say he's not a bad guy, he just needs a chance, he's just sad - - well I tried to be good to him, but I can't. Not anymore. I will not allow him or his daughter in this house. I will not allow you spending time with her, doing projects or whatever it is that you're doing. THAT'S IT. I hope we're clear. Jack turns to leave but Joe, enraged, says:
JOE: We're not clear. Jack stops stunned Joe's heart pounds
JACK: What'd you say?
JOE: We're not clear. You and I aren't clear about anything. We couldn't be less clear.
JACK: Joseph Francis Lamb
JOE: ( ERUPTING )
JACK: I'm not having this discussion with She's NICE to me!
JOE: She's NICE to me!
JACK: I don't care what she is! Her father is a selfish, irresponsible Jack moves CLOSE to Joe intimidating Joe steps back Jack is fucking intense:
JACK: And now BODIES are seen of SOLDIERS, holding and aiming WEAPONS. Then, a VOICE over a TRUCK PA:
JACK: I'm here to see Colonel Nelec. He told me to meet him here.
JACK: WHERE'S NELEC? INT. MILITARY MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT TIGHT ON NELEC. Past an IV and medical machinery. He's looking at someone we don't yet see. In the background, Overmyer stands, watching. Nelec is quiet, simple:
WHERE'S NELEC?: INT. MILITARY MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT TIGHT ON NELEC. Past an IV and medical machinery. He's looking at someone we don't yet see. In the background, Overmyer stands, watching. Nelec is quiet, simple:
NELEC: I don't want any more trouble. Do Now we see who he's talking to. IT'S DR. WOODWARD. Battered and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.
DR. WOODWARD: I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec, when you take care of people.
NELEC: I'm going to bait him. I'm going to catch him.
DR. WOODWARD: He's in me, you know. As I am in him. So when you see him next, as I'm sure you will. I'll be watching you, too. Nelec offers a vague, searching smile. But Woodward will not - - not ever relent. So. Nelec moves to the door, he remains FACING CAMERA, his back to Woodward, as Overmyer moves to the bed. PUSH IN ON NELEC'S FACE, UNDERSTANDING HIS TRUE NATURE

CONVERSATION: And the POWER RETURNS Joe's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS. Joe crawls to the projector to stop it but:
ALICE: no, keep it please Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She watches the film. Can't take her eyes away.
JOE: . yeah. And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN. as tears start to fill her eyes. Behind her, at a near WHISPER:

JOE: I'll get the camera back, I know where my dad put it We can still make the festival.
CHARLES: It's not about the movie.
JOE: Then what is it about?
CHARLES: Jesus, you don't even get it do you? It's obvious.
JOE: What's obvious?
CHARLES: Gawd, you're a dumb ass.
CHARLES: That night of the crash, you started getting all weird.
JOE: Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden.
CHARLES: Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden.
JOE: Your movie was over! That's what you said! You were upset. I gave you a camera! I helped you!
CHARLES: Don't pretend like you did it for me! You didn't do it for me and you know it!
JOE: What's your problem? Charles ROLLS THE FILM, DIMS THE LIGHTS
CHARLES: It was never about me! It was always about Alice! And suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there she is: ALICE, from the night of the train crash. The scene plays as they filmed it:
MRS. HATHAWAY: John. I don't like it. This case. These murders.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY: What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you? THE FILMED SCENE CONTINUES as Joe and Charles argue:
JOE: Well, you're the one who wanted the wife in the movie!
CHARLES: Not so you could fall in love with Joe's mind spins how does he respond to this?!
JOE: What do you even care what I think about Alice?!
CHARLES: Because I like her! That's why! That's why I asked her in the first place! So I could get to know her, not YOU!
JOE: wait, you like Alice Dainard?
CHARLES: You're such an idiot.
JOE: ( from Charles' movie ) Guys, look out! They watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS but it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing. Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the SETTLING DEBRIS. Charles moves forward, so the film is now partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM.
CHARLES: SHIT! Look at all that smoke! We can't use any of this. And you won't even let me blow up your train. Everything's bogus.
JOE: We can make another train and blow that one up. Joe moves forward. Part of the film PROJECTED ON HIM, too.
CJAR: Shut up. It's okay.
JOE: . Charles.
CHARLES: I know it's stupid. What would she ever like me? I haven't leaned out yet, which the doctor says is gonna

JOE: Mr. Dainard, it's Joe Lamb. I know you don't like me sir, and I'm sorry about that but I'm looking for my dad And Louis GRABS HIS SHIRT and pulls him close. In a voice desperate and heartsick, he says:
LOUIS: It took her.
JOE: ( long beat, sotto ) . what?
LOUIS: It took her. I saw it. It was. something. so. big, like nothing it was and no one. no one believes me.
JOE: . I believe you. And Louis looks at him with hope

CHARLES PRESTON: Back where? To do what?
MARTIN JOE: She's dead, if it took her, she don't say that!
PRESTON: Wait a minute first of all, I want to live. Okay?
JOE: I'm going whether you come or not which I really hope you do.

JEN: As if I'm gonna help you.
CHARLES: Do this for me and I'll babysit the twins next week so you can go to Wendy's stupid party. Jen suddenly closes her magazine, stares at him suspiciously.
JEN: . does it have to be him?
CHARLES: Yes or no, you ugly freak. I'm about to rescind the offer.
JEN: This whole evacuation thing's freaking me out. Making me rethink my priorities. Saw you over here and thought maybe we could kick Now we see Donny, looking RIGHT AT US. Utterly stunned.
DONNY: we totally could.
JEN: I asked Charles about you, and he said you're a great guy
DONNY: I totally am.
JEN: Will you hate me if I start our relationship by asking a favor?
DONNY: So there are rules to being in my car, okay?
CARY: Where the hell are we going anyway?
JOE: We're going to the school to open the trailer Woodward had in the parking lot. I bet that's where he keeps his research. The boys duck as SOLDIERS pass by.
CARY: What research?
JOE: We're gonna learn everything we can about that thing so we can find it. And that's how we're gonna save Dorks: no shoes on the upholstery and no one touches the CB, gottit?
DONNY: Dorks: no shoes on the upholstery and no one touches the CB, gottit?
CHARLES: You think Woodward's got information about that thing in the Why else are there padlocks on the We're going to the school.
JOE: Why else are there padlocks on the We're going to the school.
DONNY: When did this one get so bossy?
JACK: Hey! I gotta take a leak! What am I supposed to do, piss in here?! A beat. He POUNDS again. The door finally unlocks and opens. A 32-year-old humorless, armed SOLDIER stands there.
JACK: So am I going in alone or are y?
RIFLE: EXT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT - DAY A SOLDIER crosses to a vehicle, on his radio when KAFA- BOOOOOM! The FUEL TANK EXPLODES, A MASSIVE BLAST! The airmen take cover, RUN TO MOVE NEARBY VEHICLES, GENERAL MAYHEM and our CAMERA BOOMS UP to the MILITARY JEEP THAT DRIVES
MARTIN: Well, so guys, if the Air Force has already searches Woodward's house, wouldn't they've already searched the classroom too?
CARY: Hay Donny, this car is gnarly.
CHARLES: I was thinking about that too.
JOE: Maybe the classroom, but not the Yeah, Woodward has all kinds of weird stuff in the dungeon.
CHARLES: Yeah, Woodward has all kinds of weird stuff in the dungeon.
MARTIN: Where's the dungeon?
DONNY: Shut up. What kind of music does she like? Your sister.
CHARLES: I don't care. Disco I guess?
DONNY: I could get back into disco.
JOE: We shouldn't take River Road, they had a roadblock.
DONNY: Dork. I saw it. Observe. Donny YANKS the steering wheel he turns onto a DIRT ROAD the car RUMBLES away from camera
DONNY: So what, I wait here like a douche?
JOE: Yes. Thank you very much. Do you have a tire iron?
CHARLES: Joe, let me try let me try. Joe hands the tire iron to Charles he tries nothing. As Martin grabs the tire iron:
JOE: MARTIN CHARLES
GUYS: MARTIN CHARLES
MARTIN CHARLES: Look at all this junk. He's got movies in here.
CHARLES: I cannot believe we're breaking into school, who does that? No one does that idiots do that The boys BREAK A CLASSROOM DOOR WINDOW and enter.
JOE: Dr. Woodward was dishonorably discharged from Nellis Air Base in 1963 because of "subversive conduct," whatever that is.
MARIN: Dude, check it out. Old Man Back when he was like Middle-Aged Man Woodward.
CHARLES: Back when he was like Middle-Aged Man Woodward.
MARTIN: He's been tracking this thing since like 1958.
JOE: ( to the movie ) What is this?
CHARLES: I don't know. It says April 8th, 1963 incident. I dunno.
JOE: Cary, we got to find this thing.
CARY: Cary puts a CASSETTE into a tape deck, hits PLAY:
IS PREDOMINANTLY: subterranean. He's being subterranean treated without compassion or VARIOUS SHOTS of PHOTOGRAPHS AND DOCUMENTS: "UFO CRASH,"
CARY: Guys, it's Dr. Woodward. Look. Woodward offers what looks like RAW MEAT to the motionless, sitting CREATURE. All the boys watch quietly then, suddenly, in milliseconds, the creature is UP, GRABBING WOODWARD THROUGH THE BARS the boys JUMP
CHARLES MARTIN: Arh! I can't watch that!
JOE: Woodward wasn't trying to kill it.
CHARLES: He was trying to help it escape. Just then a MUFFLED SHATTER-CRASH
MARTIN: Did you hear that? Suddenly BOOM! The doors BURST OPEN and ARMED COMMANDOS,
CHARLES COMMANDO: DON'T KILL US! PLEASE DON'T ( calls on radio ) KILL US!!! PLEASE DON'T KILL we've got civilians US!!! minors four of `em.
CHARLES: oh shit!
NELEC: Search them. Overmyer CHECKS THEIR POCKETS as Nelec TAKES CARY'S BACKPACK, opens it pulls out some FIREWORKS. Proudly:
CARY: I rolled those M-80's myself, that's right.
NELEC: ( eyes flick to Joe ) You're the Deputy's boy. Joe's terrified as Overmyer pulls from Joe's pocket a couple COINS, half a pack of Bubble Yum and HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE. Drops everything but the necklace. Joe reacts, panicked
JOE: hey, no
NELEC: ( TO OVERMYER )
DONNY: . oh shit. His stoned mind races. Staying hidden from the remaining military, Donny scrambles for his CB, turns to CHANNEL 9, grabs the mike, speaks quietly, frantic:
SOLDIER: Staff Sergeant.
JACK: Hi, how are you doing?
YOUNG KID: Hi, Mr. Lamb.
JACK: Jack moves to Officer Rosko, who reacts to seeing him dressed this way
OFFICER ROSKO: Where the hell you been? What are
YOU WEARING: come here. The Air Force set that fire, they want the town empty for some reason. The whole military operation, the evacuation, everything is all bad.
JACK: come here. The Air Force set that fire, they want the town empty for some reason. The whole military operation, the evacuation, everything is all bad.
OFFICER ROSKO: Did you hear about Joe? Dispatch just got a call on citizen's band: Joe and some friends were grabbed by military personnel at the middle Off Jack's REACTION
JACK: Tell me everything, right now, and I won't throw you in jail.
PRESTON: ( holds the SUPER 8 FILM ) But you should look at this first.
NEWS REPORTER: Chief Master Sergeant, Dustoff-03 is twenty minutes out.
CHARLES: . what. what's gonna happen?
CARY: I think we're gonna die.
MARTIN: No. They'd never do that.
JOE: guys I forced you to come with me. I'm. I'm so sorry. ( looks to Charles ) I'm so sorry.
CARY: I think they're gonna kill us.
CHARLES: ( UNCONVINCING )
JOE: . why? But just as he's spoken, a SHAPE FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND HIM
RIGHT TIRES: INT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT The MILITARY DRIVER struggles with the wheel
DRIVER: HOLD ON. HOLD ON!!! Was that the thing from the train?!
CHARLES: Was that the thing from the train?!
CHARLES: Was that it?! Oh my God!!!
MARTIN: I can't see anything do you see
JIE: not yet !
DRIVER: Sir, I gotta pull over!
CHARLES: Oh my God, guys Joe turns to see NELEC LOADING A RIFLE, straining to see out a driver's side window. Mayhem:
CARY CHARLES: Sako Bolt Action, 30-06 ( pronounced: thirty-aut-six ) okay okay okay, I get it Leathwood Art Scope Hernandez makes a radio call, Overmyer straining to see out the windows as Nelec locks and loads the unique ammo and moves to a driver's side window, tries to see
HERNANDEZ OVERMYER: repeat, contact with precious cargo, thirty clicks sir, I do not have visual - from center of town, - Driver, can you see currently headed for Base anything?
FORTRESS: HERNANDEZ DRIVER
HERNANDEZ DRIVER: send support immediately! No sir, nothing! Despite his handcuffs, Charles desperately tries to unlatch his seatbelt with his shaking hands Cary sees this:
CARY: Charles, what are you doing?
CHARLES: I don't feel good about this PUSH IN on Cary, to CLOSEUP, looking PAST CAMERA, TERRIFIED
CARY: oh God guys
NELEC: Here. Tag it. Overmyer is stunned for a moment, but hides it well:
OVERMYER: Open the door. Reluctant as hell, for a tense beat, the Driver pulls the controls: the door HISSES LOUDLY as it opens.
NELEC: Open the door. Reluctant as hell, for a tense beat, the Driver pulls the controls: the door HISSES LOUDLY as it opens.
OVERMYER: Is there anywhere in particul
NELEC: GET US OUT OF HERE, NOW! NOW!!! What kind of firepower do we have? CHARLES SCRAMBLES to unlatch his seatbelt
JOE: Charles! Maybe you should wait!
CHARLES: FOR WHAT?! ANOTHER MONSTER?!?! BAAAM!!! The bus is SLAMMED SO HARD
CRUNCHES: The boys gather their wits LIGHTS FLASHING HAUNTINGLY
JOE: you guys okay?!
CHARLES: I wanna go home so bad Joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door tries the handle but it's never gonna open. On the OTHER side of the glass, Nelec rights himself, momentarily disoriented breathing heavily, he moves away from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the kids; he tries the handle, but it won't open for him either. And there is Joe and Nelec, face-to-face Joe seeing the fear in Nelec's eyes his understanding that this is his fate. Somehow Nelec takes this moment to look into Joe's face to silently in a look repent. Instantly, Joe knows he's about to watch this man's life end. SMASH! Nelec turns the creature is BUSTING the bus door SMASHING AT IT to make it BIGGER. So it can get inside. The Driver's LEG IS CAUGHT he's trying to get out, but cannot is PANICKING as SSSSTAB!!! The creature KILLS HIM INSTANTLY and SMASH as again it tries to WIDEN the door. Nelec WINCES the only conscious man on this side of the glass; the boys COWER on their side, with each monstrous hit, all their eyes on Nelec except Joe, who only wants to get to Alice. He sees the SHATTERED BULLETPROOF WINDOW above them, on what has become the "roof" of the bus.
JOE: Up there, there's broken glass
MARTIN: here, use me, I'm strong!
JOE: Lemme get on your shoulders!
CHARLES: I'm strong! The boys struggle to get Joe onto Martin's shoulders as, on the other side of the glass, Nelec scrambles for Hernandez's fallen SEMI-AUTO RIFLE. He grabs it and scampers back to the glass as SMASH!!! Pieces of metal and glass BURST like ice chips as the creature violently WIDENS the bus door opening On Charles' shoulders, Joe can reach the shattered-but-thick window which he must HIT BREAK OPEN to get out essentially exactly what the creature is doing, in reverse. Using both fists, Joe POUNDS the window. No give.
MARTIN CARY: Harder! Come on, you PUSSY!!! With all his might, Joe hits the window again the SLIGHTEST sound of glass adjusting meanwhile, SLAM!!! The creature BUSTING the bus door PRYING it wider like a sardine can NELEC SITS AGAINST THE GLASS AND OPENS FIRE, FUTILELY, ON THE CREATURE. He makes a CALL on his walkie:
NELEC: This is Nelec use the big guns. Whatever happens to me, you take it down, you kill him and he drops the walkie and FIRES AGAIN the LOUD GUNFIRE BARELY AUDIBLE behind the glass with the boys as Joe hits the glass again BAM a CRINKLING of glass
CHARLES: You can do it! Joe hits again so does the creature as Nelec RUNS OUT OF AMMO. That was never really hope anyway. Joe hits again and CRASH! The window SHATTERS! Glass chunks RAIN DOWN on the boys all covering their face Cary seeing the CREATURE
CARY: Go! Joe, move!!! With all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up outside the bus, Joe peeks out the fucking creature its back to Joe just fifteen feet away, focused on the door and Joe strains to climb out here, onto the top-side of the bus. And as the boys climb out, the creature climbs in first Joe, then Charles ( AD LIB DIALOGUE WITH CARY AND MARTIN: "You gotta lose some weight " "I know!!!" ), Then Cary, and Martin last they all jump down to the dirt they hear SCREAMS and turn back for a moment Inside the bus, Nelec watches as the creature ENTERS THE
NELEC: it was my turn once. to find you. Now. it's your t
CHARLES: I just sharteezed a little.
SOLDIER: You need to come with us, we have some questions for you
LOUIS: what, is she. Is she dead?
SOLDIER TWO: Just come with us. Standing is hard for heartsick Louis, his legs so hurt suddenly JACK IS THERE, acting the role of Air Force:
JACK: Hey fellas, I've got orders from Colonel Nelec to personally transport this man to base.
SOLDIER: He's all yours, Staff Sergeant. As the two Soldiers head off, Jack wraps Louis' arm over his shoulders, heads off in the other direction, as Louis looks him over, confused:
LOUIS: Where're we going?
JACK: to find our kids. On LOUIS' FACE a surprised glimmer of HOPE
CARY: Got my fireworks back!
CHARLES: ( who gives a shit ) They turn: a car comes, fast PUSH IN ON JOE who studies the oncoming car, as behind him:
MARTIN: They're coming, man! I think we should go!
JOE: No!!! No, look! The car ARRIVES: It's DONNY. He gets out of his car, wild- and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them:
DONNY: Ho ho!!! You dorks are alive! I didn't know.! ( finally sees the bus ) . what the FUCK?!
JOE: We need to get back to town!
DONNY: Hop in, man! But you should know: I am massively stoned right now.
JOE: You want me to drive? Donny looks at Joe, like it hurts to think.
CHARLES: Joe, where are we going?
JOE: I saw something at the cemetery. Woodward said it's subterranean I think I know where it
CARY: What's that? What are those sounds?
MARTIN: Guys, that sounds like guns!
CARY: ( points to a tank ) What the hell is that?! SUDDENLY, BOOM!!! A DEAFENING, CONCUSSIVE GUNBLAST! They're LIT UP by what they see ahead: in the oncoming cross-street,
CHARLES: TURN THE CAR AROUND! Joe quickly turns left into a driveway but we PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIM from the direction they just came are MORE TANKS AND MILITARY VEHICLES Joe's eyes go wide they're stuck. GUNFIRE CONTINUES!
JOE: We gotta go by foot!
CHARLES: Just follow me! ( nudges Donny hard ) ) Donny! Hey! Donny, wake up! ( Donny half looks at him ) We have to get out of here!
JOE: Just follow me! ( nudges Donny hard ) ) Donny! Hey! Donny, wake up! ( Donny half looks at him ) We have to get out of here!
CARY: He's too stoned!
MARTIN: Drugs are so bad! Joe and the boys get out of the car fast and RUN across the street, zig-zagging between the enormous MILITARY VEHICLES
SOLDIER: Sir, the weapons are misfiring! Surface to air, radar all of them! It's a mess out here, sir. Soldier hurries off.
CARY: You guys see those explosions? They were huge.
MARTIN: whose house is this?
CARY: ( he hands him a picture ) Kathy's. I got it off the fridge.
MARTIN: Kathy? Oh, Kathy's cool. Another CRAZY LOUD AND BRIGHT EXPLOSION the light fixtures sway. Charles grabs a coke on the counter.
JOE: Come on, guys, let's go. Come on! Joe runs the others follow
CARY: Where we going?
JOE: To the cemetery But as they get to the living room a HUGE EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT A WALL! They all go down but Martin is in agony all of a sudden his leg RIPPED by concrete. If there's good news here, the creature has left this area the explosions getting further away. But there's blood and Martin is in real What happened to my leg? It hurts.
MARTIN: What happened to my leg? It hurts.
CHARLES: Oh shit, Martin, you gotta bone sticking out of your leg!
CARY: There's a hole in the house!
CHARLES: Joe, gimme that thing on the Charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on the wall that now has a HOLE in it; MILITARY VEHICLES can be seen driving past outside. Joe hands Charles the thick fabric tie which Charles fashion into a tourniquet, wraps it around Martin's leg, tight
JOE: I'm gonna go find Alice you have to stay with Martin. Charles looks at Martin can't argue. Says, sincerely:
CHARLES: . you gonna be okay without me?
JOE: ( a meaningful beat ) . yeah.
CARY: I'm not staying with the girls!
CHARLES: God, Cary. Shut up!
CARY: Calm down.
MARTIN: Oh, my leg hurts!
JOE: Come on, Cary, we gotta go. Joe nods, determined, and he and Cary head off
CHARLES: This is going to hurt. Martin screams.
CARY: So what are we doing here?
JOE: Just follow me.
CARY: I've been following you for the last five blocks. What are we doing Joe and Cary run through the graveyard and over to the
JOE: Help me!
CARY: Help you with what?
JOE: We need to get inside.
CARY: For what? What's in these windows?
JOE: Cary, help me.
CARY: It's dirt. Why is there dirt in these windows?
JOE: Help me, on three.
CARY: Whoa. This is scary.
JOE: You got any sparklers in there?
CARY: Are you kidding me? Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER. LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN. The thing falls far enough to tell them it's too far to jump.
JOE: Alice is down there.
LOUIS: I came to your house that day. To tell you that I never meant to hurt anyone. Swear to God. ( beat, respectful tears ) I'm sorry, Jack. About what happened to your wife. Jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road. A beat. Finally:
JACK: . It was an accident. It was an Jack glances at him. A small nod of forgiveness and gratitude. Louis wants to cry again, but just accepts it.
CARY: Joe, I don't understand We HEAR a DISTANT RUMBLING like something far off, but MECHANICAL. Then:
JOE: Shhh. This way. They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a TALL OVAL
CARY: It's Sheriff Pruitt.
JOE: I know. Cary look. Makeshift HANGING BULBS provide some light; a number of other TUNNELS are visible from here, too. Joe and Cary look at the space in disbelief.
CARY: What is this?
JOE: We're under the water tower.
CARY: It's eating a person. Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other side of the machinery and there he sees, in an INSET section of the rock-wall, THREE HUMAN BODIES, HANGING
JOE: She's here. We're going to use your I don't think it's going to hurt it, Joe.
CARY: I don't think it's going to hurt it, Joe.
JOE: There are other tunnels.
CARY: I need you to make noise. Lots of it, right here, in two minutes. Make it loud and make it last gimme some sparklers.
JOE: I need you to make noise. Lots of it, right here, in two minutes. Make it loud and make it last gimme some sparklers.
CARY: ( goes through his bag ) why what are you gonna do?
JOE: ( takes SPARKLERS and a LIGHTER from Cary ) Make sure you're gone by the time it blows: you can't be here, you gotta run.
CARY: Where are you going?
CARY: come on damnit! FFT! FFT! No go he keeps trying.
JOE: Cary, come on, come on
CARY: He looks up watches the creature GRAB AND PULL ALICE'S LIFELESS BODY DOWN FROM HER HANGING POSITION it moves with her to where he was eating the teacher Cary SHAKES THE
JOE: Alice, please please ( nothing SLAP ) Alice, wake up! Nothing so he fucking SLAPS HER FACE HARD and she suddenly INHALES SHARPLY, he eyes WIDE, terrified
ALICE: What is this? What are you doing I'm just doing the best I can to save you. She GRABS HIM AND HUGS HIM TIGHT, teary and grateful during which quietly:
JOE: I'm just doing the best I can to save you. She GRABS HIM AND HUGS HIM TIGHT, teary and grateful during which quietly:
ALICE: How did you know?
JOE: Your dad. He told me. He was worried. And flipping out.
ALICE: we need to move But she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense:
JOE: we need to move But she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense:
TINA: I left my bag in my car. Then I went to my car to get my bag
ALICE: It's been experimented on for years. It's terrified and exhausted and hungry, it just wants to go home. When it touched me, I knew
JOE: Alice, help me get the sheriff Follow me. I can get us out of Sheriff, we came that way.
SHERIFF PRUITT: Follow me. I can get us out of Sheriff, we came that way.
JOE: Sheriff, we came that way.
SHERIFF PRUITT: Don't argue with me.
TINA: Come on, kids, let's go with the Joe and Alice follow. They run into a tunnel. We PUSH IN ON THE MECHANICAL DEVICE the PITCH INCREASING MORE NOW AS IF IT'S ABOUT TO "FUNCTION" The creature returns and sees that the humans are gone. He takes off.
JOE: Sheriff, I really think we're going the wrong way.
PRUITT: We'll talk about it when we get up They continue following Pruitt.
JOE: I told you to get out!
CARY: I thought this was the way out. I tried! Hey, Alice, welcome back
PRUITT: Kids, come on, we gotta go.
JOE: GO! YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE, GO! Joe, what are you doing?
CARY: Joe, what are you doing?
JOE: WE UNDERSTAND! WE KNOW HOW HARD IT'S BEEN! BUT NOT EVERYONE IS Joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you!
HORRIBLE!: Joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you!
CARY: Joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you!
JOE: YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY NOW! AND IT GRABS JOE AND LIFTS HIM Alice and Cary SCREAM AS
CARY: Okay, wait a minute, WHAT?! Then, over the HIGH-PITCHED MECHANICAL SOUND comes RUMBLINGS - - like THUNDER from above and the three LOOK UP
CARY: what's he doing.?
JOE: . he's making a model. AGAIN and AGAIN, pieces FLY OVERHEAD, beginning to FORM WHAT
