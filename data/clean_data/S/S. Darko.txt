COREY: We're not goin' back. Even El Reno's better than there.
COREY: How much money do we have left?
SAM: Not a whole lot.
COREY: I can't believe your fucking parents wouldn't give you anything.
SAM: They totally flipped out that I was even going. They weren't about to give me money for the big trip.
COREY: We should've waited till the end of the month when my mom gets her She wouldn't have given you I know where she keeps her cash. What's she gonna do, send her boyfriend after me?

SAM: Just keep walking.
COREY: EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON Vietnam Tom crouches in a decrepit SHACK covered by a piece of CORRUGATED ROOFING. He works with great focus, arranging VARIOUS BITS OF METAL into some sort of small SCULPTURE.
RANDY: Hey, what's up?
COREY: Not much. just getting stared down by creepy priest boy back Father Homeijer?
JEFF: Father Homeijer?
MIKE: Don't worry, you're a little old for his taste.
JEFF: Yeah, he's a fuckin' perv.

SAM: Yeah. Definitely.
RUTH: That pig, O'Dell.
RANDY: That pig, O'Dell.
RUTH: That pig, O'Dell.
RANDY: Don't worry about Ryan. He might be a cop, but he still likes to party.
RUTH: I think that asshole knows I deal. You know how fucked that is?
RANDY: From what I hear he's got a little somethin' goin' on the side Fucking pig's a pig.
RUTH: Fucking pig's a pig.
SAM: What the hell.
RANDY: We might as well all go in now, we're already wet.
RUTH: Good idea.
RANDY: You fall asleep down there?
CHRIS: Thought you could maybe use this.
CHRIS: So what's so wrong at home that you had to take off?
SAM: I hate it there. It's like everyone knows everything about me, but I'm invisible at the same time. It's like the worst of both worlds.
CHRIS: Small towns. How `bout your family?
SAM: They didn't want me to leave. well, they did, but they wanted me to go away to Harvard or something like that, like my sister.
CHRIS: ( changing gears ) That's why I love Corey, she just doesn't give a shit. She does what she wants and she doesn't care what people think.
SAM: ( changing gears ) That's why I love Corey, she just doesn't give a shit. She does what she wants and she doesn't care what people think.
CHRIS: You just gotta be yourself, that's all. What is it you wanna do I always thought I'd be a dancer, like in a troupe or something.
SAM: I always thought I'd be a dancer, like in a troupe or something.
CHRIS: When I was younger, my dance team was on Star Search.
SAM: When I was younger, my dance team was on Star Search.
CHRIS: Yeah. but I didn't go.
SAM: Yeah. but I didn't go.
CHRIS: Why not?
SAM: I didn't end up dancing in the talent show where they got discovered. I didn't really feel like it at the time anyway.
CHRIS: But that's why we're going to Vegas. There's lots of opportunities there.
SAM: But that's why we're going to Vegas. There's lots of opportunities there.
CHRIS: ( SMIRKING ) Yeah, good place for it. Gettin' some practice on the way, too.
SAM: Is that supposed to be like some kind of judgement or something?
CHRIS: No, I was just-
PHIL: You plannin' on checkin' out today?
SAM: ( GROGGY ) Uh. I, I don't know yet.
PHIL: Well, it's already way past checkout time, so you'd better figure it out quick.
SAM: I've just gotta find Corey. and check on the car.
PHIL: You do whatever you have to, but if you're stayin' another night I wanna see some money up front.
TRUDY: I don't believe it. I still just don't believe it.
TRUDY: ( dabbing at her eyes with Can I help you?
SAM: Is everything okay?
TRUDY: No, it's not. Mount Calvary burned to the ground last night.
SAM: Mount Calvary?
TRUDY: Father Homeijer's church.
SAM: Oh. How did it happen?
TRUDY: The police are looking into it, but. I know it was arson.
SAM: Are you able to get money wired here from my bank back home?
TRUDY: We don't usually work with other banks like that.
SAM: I need to check my balance and get my money out. How do I do that?
TRUDY: You'll have to call and arrange it. You could always use Western Union. Where's your bank?
SAM: Oh. `cause they're gonna need to have a signature.
TRUDY: Oh. `cause they're gonna need to have a signature.
JEREMY: Hi there.
SAM: I didn't get your name at the I'm Sam.
JEREMY: I didn't get your name at the I'm Sam.
SAM: I'm Sam.
JEREMY: They shake, and Jeremy holds her hand for a little longer than what is generally comfortable.
SAM: Trying to get money. not very I've gotta pick up some cash too. Need some supplies for the lab. I don't think I've even slept since I got my hands on that meteorite. You should come by the lab with me and check it out.
JEREMY: I've gotta pick up some cash too. Need some supplies for the lab. I don't think I've even slept since I got my hands on that meteorite. You should come by the lab with me and check it out.
SAM: I can't.
JEREMY: I could let you borrow some money. if you need some.
SAM: I don't even know you.
JEREMY: That's okay. I trust you.
SAM: Thanks anyway.
JEREMY: You're sure you don't want to check out the lab?
SAM: Sorry. I've gotta find Corey.
JEREMY: Maybe some other time.
MIKE: How many cheeseburgers did we get?
RUTH: Like eight.
JEFF: Wait, did we get smokes?
FATHER HOMEIJER: They're made of silver-plated steel. A simple fire couldn't do What are you sayin'?
OFFICER O'DELL: What are you sayin'?
FATHER HOMEIJER: This is an extension of Satan's own hand. I've seen it coming.
AFTERNOON: Sam is walking in front of a DEPARTMENT STORE when Randy's car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the passenger side window.
COREY: What happened to you?
SAM: What happened to me.? Where the hell've you been?
COREY: I crashed at Randy's. We just got food. Want a burger?
SAM: My stomach's fucked up.
COREY: Don't worry about it so much.
SAM: The motel guy came to the room this morning all pissed off. We're probably not even gonna have enough money to pay for the car.
RANDY: Should I wait a minute?
JEFF: We gotta get some smokes.
COREY: Just go ahead. I'll catch up with you later on.
RANDY: Alright. Later.
SAM: We just gotta figure out what we're gonna do. I don't think-
COREY: ( ABRUPT ) Lemme guess, you wanna go home.
SAM: You wanna run back to mommy and daddy and say sorry so they can put you through college. Well that's real big of you, Sam, but I don't have that option.
COREY: You wanna run back to mommy and daddy and say sorry so they can put you through college. Well that's real big of you, Sam, but I don't have that option.
SAM: ( taken aback ) What are you talking about?
COREY: I'll go home and get the shit kicked out of me, and get my ass grabbed by my mom's boyfriend.
SAM: I'm not bailing on you. Would you
COREY: You can fucking sleepwalk back to Middlesex for all I care. I'm not driving you. you're a fucking
SAM: Fuck you, Corey.
OFFICER O'DELL: You're sure you didn't see a
COREY: He takes the statement from her.
OFFICER O'DELL: Well, you're one lucky girl to have gotten outta the car when you did. Front passenger side was wiped right out. Coulda' been two dead girls today instead of one.
COREY: Can't you just look up the license No plates on the vehicle. We're investigating the VIN, but that could take a little more time, depending on the history of ownership. We'll find him.
OFFICER O'DELL: No plates on the vehicle. We're investigating the VIN, but that could take a little more time, depending on the history of ownership. We'll find him.
COREY: What about the missing boy?
OFFICER O'DELL: You really think it was him, huh?
COREY: He was on the side of the road right before the accident.
OFFICER O'DELL: I'm no psychiatrist, but I do know sometimes shock does funny You think I was hallucinating?
COREY: You think I was hallucinating?
OFFICER O'DELL: We were on the scene five minutes after the accident. I think somebody woulda noticed a little boy wandering around.
COREY: Like what?
CHRIS: Get the hell outta here.
COREY: What're you doing here?
CHRIS: I had to put in a statement too. Can I give you a lift?
CHRIS: I'm real sorry about Sam.
COREY: I said some pretty shitty things to her right before it happened.
CHRIS: I'm sure she knew you didn't mean
COREY: Fragmentary Universe.
BILLY MOORCROFT: You need to save me, Corey.
COREY: Why can't anyone see you?
BILLY MOORCROFT: If you tell them about me they'll think you're a dummy.
COREY: Why me?
BILLY MOORCROFT: I didn't pick you. Just like you didn't pick me either.
COREY: Nothing. I-I don't know.
PHIL: Go back to your room and get some sleep. You've had a tough day.
CHRIS: Hey. how ya feelin'?
COREY: Not so good.
CHRIS: Is there anything I can do?
COREY: I need some cigarettes. and maybe some food. But I don't really have any money right now.
CHRIS: I'm off at 3:30. Meet me out behind the store.
COREY: She tears open the cigarettes and lights one. Chris lights up one of his own, and notices Corey's hands are shaking.
CHRIS: Shouldn't you go back home?
COREY: There's nothing for me to go home to. Trust me.
CHRIS: What about Sam's funeral?
COREY: What's the point? She's gone, that's it. Nothing's gonna change
CHRIS: ( PUZZLED ) Yeah. you need a book?
COREY: Is it walking distance?
CHRIS: I can take you.
COREY: I think I'd rather walk.
CHRIS: So you guys were real close, huh.
COREY: When I moved to Virginia Sam was like the only person I could even stand to talk to.
CHRIS: How long had you been plannin' your trip together?
COREY: Not too long. kind of a last minute thing. It was good timing, `cause I don't like to stay in one place for too long, ya know?
CHRIS: I was really surprised when Sam wanted to come, actually. I just kinda brought it up one day, and she was down.
COREY: I was really surprised when Sam wanted to come, actually. I just kinda brought it up one day, and she was down.
CHRIS: You can't think like that.
COREY: It's true, isn't it?
CHRIS: That was Sam's brother?
COREY: On the screen is a PHOTOGRAPH of the DARKO HOUSE with many PEOPLE gathered in front of it. A JET ENGINE is being lifted away by a CRANE.
CHRIS: Her parents must be going through Sam said once she wished it landed on her room instead of Donnie's.
COREY: Sam said once she wished it landed on her room instead of Donnie's.
CHRIS: I saw something on Sam's wrist the other night. it looked like a She told me it was from some accident. Put her hand through a window or something.
COREY: She told me it was from some accident. Put her hand through a window or something.
CHRIS: Did you believe her?
COREY: They still never found a driver to that car that hit Randy. I was standing right there. I didn't see I was pretty close too, but everything was all crazy. Whoever it was must've jumped out and took I found this book in Sam's backpack last night. There's a chapter where it talks about stuff like this happening. Like a guy being killed by an arrow that nobody shot, and a swordsmith getting killed by a sword he hadn't made yet. Unexplainable things, but it says there's a reason why they happen.

COREY: It didn't say.
CHRIS: Corey sighs and turns back to the screen.
COREY: Corey sighs and turns back to the screen.
COREY: Hearts still thumping in their chests, they follow Ruth into the garage. COREY'S CHEVROLET is parked in the same spot it was when she left it the other day. The hood is propped open.
RUTH: Randy's been a wreck since the He should be. He was driving around shit-faced and somebody got killed.
CHRIS: He should be. He was driving around shit-faced and somebody got killed.
RUTH: You can just fuck off.
COREY: She's right.
RUTH: I'll get my dad.
DUSTY: Got some bad news for you.
COREY: I need a new engine now?
DUSTY: I can get one in there for you. Cost you about fifteen hundred.
COREY: I don't have anywhere near that much money.
CHRIS: That's probably as much as the car's worth.
DUSTY: I understand. But, I already ordered the water pump, and I'll have to get paid for my time. That comes to about three-hundred total.
COREY: I don't have that much either.
DUSTY: You think I do this for charity?
CHRIS: You didn't do anything. What's she want a water pump for if she doesn't have an engine?
DUSTY: I see how it is. couple a' punks. You don't plan to pay what you owe, you can get the hell off my property right now.
COREY: ( under her breath ) Let's go.
CHRIS: Let's go.
FATHER HOMEIJER: Good afternoon.
TRUDY: We're taking collections to help rebuild Mount Calvary after the tragic fire.
FATHER HOMEIJER: Any small amount you could manage would really help.
CHRIS: Father Homeijer and Trudy look over to Corey in the passenger seat but she just stares back at them.
FATHER HOMEIJER: God bless you.
CHRIS: Everybody wants somethin'.
COREY: What about you?
CHRIS: What do you mean?
COREY: You wouldn't give me stuff and drive me around if you didn't want something in return.
CHRIS: Why not?
COREY: `Cause that's just not how it Maybe you're wrong about that.
CHRIS: Maybe you're wrong about that.
COREY: See ya.
RANDY: Do you hate me?
COREY: You think it's my fault she's dead.
RANDY: You think it's my fault she's dead.
COREY: You mean it?
RANDY: You mean it?
COREY: Yeah. it wasn't your fault.
RANDY: What's that?
COREY: Oh, it's just. something of
RANDY: You wanna get outta here for a while? I got my dad's car.
RANDY: I've been comin' up here since I was a kid. Good place when you wanna just get away from
COREY: Is Ruth your girlfriend?
RANDY: Naw, we're just friends. She's pretty weird sometimes. Too like. intense, or something.
COREY: Seems like you guys are pretty Yeah. don't worry about Ruth.
RANDY: Yeah. don't worry about Ruth.
COREY: Do you ever have a hard time telling what's real and what's not
RANDY: Sometimes. sometimes something can feel really real, but it's just your mind playing tricks on you.
COREY: I've got so much shit in my head right now. I've never felt so outta control. I think I'm really goin' psycho.
RANDY: I got some acid from my buddy one time. this like flying eagle pyramid shit. I took two hits, and man. next thing I knew I was on the floor, curled up in ball, and Mike and Jeff were just standing there lookin' down at me. I could see this like glowing grid cutting through my brain, and I knew when it got all the way through I'd be this sketched out vegetable. I could picture my dad staring down at me in the hospital in my straightjacket, crying and shit.
COREY: I can still slip back into it sometimes, but I know now that my brain is what's making it real. and that's like a blessing and a curse, man, `cause that means you have to decide what's real and what's not.
RANDY: I can still slip back into it sometimes, but I know now that my brain is what's making it real. and that's like a blessing and a curse, man, `cause that means you have to decide what's real and what's not.
COREY: The things that feel the most real right now are. impossible. More like a dream.
RANDY: I know what you mean. The scariest part is thinking you're not the same person anymore. Something's changed. like your identity.
COREY: What if the change is for the
RANDY: That's fucked up.
COREY: I don't think I even care if I'm
RANDY: Let's get outta here.
COREY: This is cool.
RANDY: Randy puts his hands on her hips, running them up her torso. Corey turns to face him.
BILLY MOORCROFT: Only one day left.
COREY: What am I supposed to do?
BILLY MOORCROFT: You can do it.
COREY: BILLY MOORCROFT
BILLY MOORCROFT: It's easy.
CRASHING: EXT. STREET/DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAWN street. PULL BACK TO REVEAL
FIREMAN #2: Lucky I heard him screamin', else he woulda drowned down there.
RUTH: She begins to stuff the other bags down her pants.
CUSTOMER: I just checked aisle three.
CHRIS: They're there. At the front, by the Trapper Keepers.
COREY: I'm outta cigarettes.
CHRIS: D'ya hear the news?
COREY: They found that Billy Moorcroft kid. He was at Dusty's house.
CHRIS: They found that Billy Moorcroft kid. He was at Dusty's house.
COREY: Everything's gonna be okay.
COREY: I already saved you.
BILLY MOORCROFT: It's not over.
COREY: ( CONFUSED )
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST: ( between bites of cake ) The place for Billy to be right now is at home with his family.
BILLY'S MOTHER: Excuse me.
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST: Oh, thank you.
DAY: Billy sits at a table in the sunny, HEXAGONAL ROOM. He wears the BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT.
BILLY'S MOTHER: Are you sure you don't want some more cake?
BILLY'S FATHER: Only family and close friends are welcome here today.
COREY: I understand. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about everything that happened to Billy. And I know it doesn't seem like it, but everything happens for a reason. and it'll all work out in the end.
RANDY: EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON Corey arrives near the intersection where the accident took place. The BLACK CLOUDS overhead have become more vast and oppressive. A cold WIND blows.
AFTERNOON: Sam is walking in front of the department store when Randy's car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the passenger side window.
COREY: What happened to you?
SAM: What happened to me.? Where the hell've you been?
COREY: I crashed at Randy's. We just got food. Want a burger?
SAM: My stomach's fucked up.
COREY: Don't worry about it so much.
SAM: The motel guy came to the room this
COREY: ( INTERRUPTING ) I don't give a fuck.
SAM: Excuse me?
COREY: I said, I. Don't. Give. A. Fuck.
SAM: Corey, you're still drunk. Don't be a fuck-ass.
JEFF: Did she just call her a fuck-ass?
MIKE: What's a fuck-ass?
COREY: See ya later, Sam.
OFFICER O'DELL: I just gotta ask you one more time. you're sure you didn't see a driver?
CHRIS: You okay?
CHRIS: I'm really sorry, Sam.
SAM: What the fuck are you talking All I meant was, sometimes-
CHRIS: All I meant was, sometimes-
SAM: I know what you meant, and it's bullshit. When someone dies for no reason you can't just make one up to fill the void and make yourself feel better. It sucks, and it fucks everything up, but it doesn't mean shit beyond that.
CHRIS: I'm sorry, I-
SAM: You've obviously never lost anybody like I have, `cause if you did you'd already know that.
SAM: A portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the Manipulated can have after journeys into Tangent or Fragmentary Universes, sounds and images may be transferred from one Tangent or Fragmentary Universe to another, as all corruptions exist on relative cosmic planes.
SAM: Hi, Tom. I like your new mask.
SAM: Jeremy pulls up next to her and rolls down his window.
JEREMY: Sam? Are you okay? What are doing?
SAM: I'm. yeah, I'm okay.
JEREMY: You shouldn't be out here like this. C'mon, get in.
JEREMY: You do that a lot?
SAM: I think it's genetic or something.
JEREMY: That's interesting. I've never heard of a specific genetic marker for sleepwalking.
SAM: It's just that my brother used to do it too.
JEREMY: He doesn't anymore?
SAM: I think it's more common in children. When did your brother When he died.
JEREMY: I think it's more common in children. When did your brother When he died.
SAM: When he died.
JEREMY: I heard about your friend.
SAM: Well. okay. Thanks.
JEREMY: So. what are you gonna do?
SAM: I don't know yet.
JEREMY: I know that for every action there's an equal and opposite Yeah. I learned that in science.
SAM: Yeah. I learned that in science.
JEREMY: And everything in the universe is in constant motion, as the universe is constantly expanding.
SAM: Yeah, but do you believe that everything happens for a reason, like in life?
JEREMY: You mean like destiny?
SAM: I'm making amazing discoveries every day, practically sleeping at the lab.
JEREMY: I'm making amazing discoveries every day, practically sleeping at the lab.
SAM: What happened to your arm?
JEREMY: It's just a rash.
SAM: I know you need it. It's no big
JEREMY: I know you need it. It's no big
SAM: Thank you.
FATHER HOMEIJER: Any small amount you could manage would really help.
FAT MAN: Piss off.
FATHER HOMEIJER: God bless you.
TRUDY: Oh. hello.
FATHER HOMEIJER: ( to Sam ) God bless you.
SAM: You wanna know what happens when you die?
SAM: ( SURPRISED ) I just stopped by to see how you were holdin' up.
CHRIS: I just stopped by to see how you were holdin' up.
SAM: I'm okay.
CHRIS: Sorry about the other night. I
SAM: I was just upset. I shouldn't have snapped at you like that.
CHRIS: So what are you still doin' here? I figured you woulda hopped on a bus by now.
SAM: I'm gonna be taking off soon, I think. I just gotta figure some stuff out. It's quiet here.
CHRIS: I don't know if you're doin' anything later on, but.
SAM: I was just on my way out. What were you gonna say?
CHRIS: Okay, well. I'll see you later?
SAM: Okay, well. I'll see you later?
CHRIS: Yeah, sure.
SAM: Chris stares down Jeremy as Sam gets into his car and they drive off together.
CHRIS: Chris stares down Jeremy as Sam gets into his car and they drive off together.
JEREMY: Here's my station.
SAM: That's it?
JEREMY: The rest is locked away somewhere else. somewhere safe. Everyone's gonna want a piece of this thing pretty soon.
SAM: It's a scanning electron microscope. It uses electrons instead of light to scan the image.
JEREMY: It's a scanning electron microscope. It uses electrons instead of light to scan the image.
SAM: And what's that?
JEREMY: An unrecognizable element. I've done all the tests. It doesn't exist on the periodic table.
SAM: So this is pretty major.
JEREMY: This is history. I'm thinking of calling it framium.
SAM: For my last name. Frame.
JEREMY: For my last name. Frame.
SAM: What if it's like. proof of some alien life-form from another galaxy or something.
JEREMY: It's very important you promise me you won't tell anyone else what I've showed you. I have to wait till just the right moment. NASA, or some secret government organization could come in here and take it away from me.
SAM: I won't say anything.
JEREMY: Sam stares at him for a long beat, as if examining him.
SAM: There's this book I think you'd like. I got it from my physics teacher in high school.
JEREMY: The study of physics has unraveled some of the most profound mysteries of the universe.
SAM: It's called The Philosophy of Time Time travel?
JEREMY: Time travel?
SAM: Yeah, but it's not really that. It's more like one scenario, or one type of scenario. I don't completely understand it.
JEREMY: What do you mean?
SAM: My life seems to be full of them.
JEREMY: Mysteries are what make life
SAM: That doesn't look good.
JEREMY: I should get some Hydrocortisone.
SAM: ( regarding the attempted
KISS ): Sorry about that.
JEREMY: I'm sorry. I should've know better. You barely know me, right?
SAM: And nobody really calls my Samantha. Just my mom and dad.
FATHER HOMEIJER: You take this street, I'll take that one?
TRUDY: Good luck.
FATHER HOMEIJER: He can hear COUNTRY MUSIC playing low within.
FATHER HOMEIJER: ( calling out ) Dusty? I'd like to trouble you for a small donation.
FATHER HOMEIJER: Who's there?
OFFICER O'DELL: Get in there, you sick fuck.
TELEVISION ANCHOR: We have an update this morning on our breaking news of Billy Moorcroft, the El Reno youth who was kidnapped over 15 months ago, and rescued yesterday afternoon by Father Homeijer of Mount Calvary Church. Billy's condition at this time is considered stable.
FIELD REPORTER: Father, what led you to this particular house on this particular I was out collecting donations in order to help rebuild my church, Mount Calvary, which recently burned down. Clearly the Lord works in mysterious ways. This is nothing less than divine intervention.

AGATHA: Dusty Gibbens has been comin' in here for coffee ever since I can remember. gives me the shivers.

AGATHA: ( to Sam ) I'll be right back with your
CHRIS: May I?
SAM: I guess you heard.
CHRIS: I guess you heard.

AGATHA: What can I get you, honey?
CHRIS: Uh. sausage, eggs, coffee, White or wheat?
AGATHA: White or wheat?
CHRIS: Wheat toast, please.
SAM: Hey, you could've been some crazy rapist serial killer.
CHRIS: Yeah, but everybody doesn't.
SAM: I can take care of myself.
CHRIS: I'm sure you can. but I wouldn't feel right if I didn't tell you about Jeremy.
SAM: What about him?
CHRIS: I don't know what you have goin' with him. but you shouldn't be hangin' around him. Let's just leave it at that.
SAM: What makes you think you can tell me who I can and can't hang around It's just that I know him better than you do. He lived in my neighborhood when we were kids.
CHRIS: It's just that I know him better than you do. He lived in my neighborhood when we were kids.
SAM: So he used to do weird stuff. to
CHRIS: So he used to do weird stuff. to
SAM: How old was he?
CHRIS: I don't know, just a couple years. Cute little black and white-
SAM: No. Jeremy.
CHRIS: He was like nine, probably.
SAM: He was just a kid, he didn't know what he was doing.
CHRIS: When you were nine years old did you know it was wrong to put a living creature in the trash can and leave it there?
SAM: Chris. you're a nice guy, but you don't have to be looking out for me. You're not my dad, you're not my big brother.
OFFICER O'DELL: You know what they do to faggot-ass perverts like you in maximum security, dontcha?

OFFICER HINES: Don't bullshit me either.
OFFICER O'DELL: Then what do you want?
OFFICER HINES: How much you think you'll get when you unload it?
OFFICER O'DELL: OFFICER HINES
OFFICER HINES: I'll take forty percent this time, but from now on it's fifty-fifty.
OFFICER O'DELL: What do you mean from now on?
OFFICER HINES: I got a pretty good idea this ain't the first time you done this. Won't be the last, will it?
OFFICER O'DELL: When he looks up, he's startled by a pair of eyes that peer from the bushes nearby. Upon closer inspection, he sees that it's Vietnam Tom in his SKI MASK.
SAM: She sets the BUNNY MASK down where she found it. Tom says nothing. He seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her there. He walks up beside her and sits, facing the view.
VIETNAM TOM: My mom told me someday everybody would understand. She said it was my job to look out for the town. so that's what I do. That's what I always do.
SAM: They're lucky to have someone to protect them.
VIETNAM TOM: I'm used to it. I'm lucky to have a job to do. Some people don't have any reason to be here at all.
SAM: I know what you mean.
VIETNAM TOM: You're more important than all of
SAM: Do you like to read?
JEREMY: When he sees the items that she's shopping for, he seems much more embarrassed than she does.
SAM: Oh, hi Jeremy.
JEREMY: Hi. sorry.
SAM: That's okay, what's up?
JEREMY: Nothing. just that I haven't see you around for the past few days. I was worried. I thought you might've taken off.
SAM: No. I've been around. Going for lots of walks.
JEREMY: I stopped by the motel.
SAM: Like I said, I've been in and out.
JEREMY: Well, there's something I wanted to ask you. You know that book you I'd really love to check it out.
SAM: I'd really love to check it out.
JEREMY: I'd really love to check it out.
SAM: Sam's face darkens, and Jeremy picks up on it.
JEREMY: You said you'd show it to me sometime, and I've got a hunch it could really help me in some of my studies related to-
SAM: I don't have it anymore.
JEREMY: I kind of. gave it to someone.
SAM: I kind of. gave it to someone.
JEREMY: To who? Why?
SAM: I'm sorry. I just. forgot that I said you could borrow it, and this
JEREMY: What guy?
SAM: Well. that Vietnam Tom guy.
JEREMY: Vietnam Tom!? You gave away the book to Vietnam Tom!?
SAM: It's just a book.
JEREMY: He's a fucking bum! And you chose him over me!?
SAM: No. I just-
CHRIS: That's enough.
JEREMY: This is none of your business.
CHRIS: It is, actually. You're disturbing my customers. Get out.
SAM: ( MUTTERING ) You didn't have to do that.
CHRIS: Just doin' my job.
TRUDY: I never had any doubts in you, or in the Lord.
FATHER HOMEIJER: I know that. And we both truly appreciate all your faith and hard
TRUDY: One more glass won't hurt you. You deserve it, Father.
OFFICER HINES: Where the hell are they?
OFFICER O'DELL: They'll be here. Just take it easy.
VIETNAM TOM: Why do you talk to me?
SAM: Same reason you talk to me.
VIETNAM TOM: Why can't other people?
SAM: They will. Only one day left.
FATHER HOMEIJER: She puts her hand on his leg.
TRUDY: I see the way you look at me,
TRUDY: I feel like such an idiot.
OFFICER HINES: What the fuck-
BOOM!: O'Dell shoots him in the chest. He is cool and calm. He throws the rifle down on the ground.
COP #1: Get down on the ground!
YOUNG OFFICER: We found this on him.
JEREMY: Hi, Sam.
SAM: That was pretty weird.
JEREMY: I know. I just.
SAM: It's alright.
JEREMY: I was wondering if you'd let me make it up to you.
SAM: You don't need to-
JEREMY: Please. let me take you to watch the fireworks tonight.
SAM: I don't think so.
JEREMY: It's gonna be spectacular. There's gonna be a meteor shower that coincides with the show. I mean, how often does that happen?
SAM: I was supposed to see `em with Chris, but. he's stuck at work.
JEREMY: So, what do you say? Will you go with me?
SAM: Gimme a sec. Lemme grab my
SAM: Shouldn't we go back out there where we can see?
JEREMY: No, this'll be perfect. See right
SAM: So what's in the bag?
JEREMY: You'll see.
SAM: They're pretty.
JEREMY: You wanna try one?
SAM: Drop it!
JEREMY: Drop it!
SAM: I think so.
JEREMY: You need to get that covered.
SAM: What are you doing?
JEREMY: It's okay.
JEREMY: How's it feel?
SAM: A little better.
JEREMY: I barely even notice it anymore. I'm sure it'll go away soon.
SAM: Are you fucking kidding me?
JEREMY: Do you think I'm disgusting?
SAM: No. I just think you should get it looked at-
JEREMY: So you do find me disgusting. Which is it, Sam, I can't take much more of this shit!
SAM: Jesus Christ.
JEREMY: Come here!
JEREMY: Sam! Stop!
FUCK!: He picks himself up and charges even faster
SAM: Why are you doing this?
JEREMY: I just wanna talk to you!
JEREMY: Jeremy crouches beside her, and when he puts two fingers to her neck to feel for a pulse, he starts to tremble.
CHRIS: Where the hell is Sam?
JEREMY: ( FRANTIC ) I don't know. I don't know.
CHRIS: He stoops by her, picks her up and hugs her limp body As he does this, Vietnam Tom approaches from behind him. Chris turns to face him but says nothing, still holding Sam. The WIND picks up and blows in gusts around them.
