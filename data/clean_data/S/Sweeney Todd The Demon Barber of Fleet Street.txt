He is THE GENTLEMAN, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and matching waistcoat. A cold and superior aristocrat. The camera slowly revolves the Gentleman becoming right side up as
GENTLEMAN: Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd. His skin was pale and his eye was odd. He shaved the faces of gentlemen Who never thereafter were heard of again. He trod a path that few have trod, Did Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.
BANKER: He kept a shop in London town, Of fancy clients and good renown, And what if none of their souls were saved? They went to their maker impeccably shaved.
BANKER: By Sweeney, By Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.
GHOSTS: Swing your razor wide, Sweeney! Hold it to the skies! Freely flows the blood of those Who moralize!
GENERAL: His needs were few, his room was bare: A lavabo and a fancy chair. A mug of suds and a leather strop, An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop.
PRIEST: A lavabo and a fancy chair. A mug of suds and a leather strop, An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop.
TOURIST: A mug of suds and a leather strop, An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop.

GENTLEMAN: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.
GHOSTS: ( variously ) Inconspicuous Sweeney was, Quick and quiet and clean `e was. Back of his smile, under his word, Sweeney heard music that nobody heard.
