FADE IN: Behind the main title and the credits:
LATE AFTERNOON: She is staring wide-eyed at the distant horseman o.s. Her little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly. DEBBIE quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the neck, crouching over him. Debbie is 11 years old with a piquant, memorable face.
AARON: ( incredulous )
ETHAN: Hello, Aaron.
ETHAN: ( a bit shakily ) Hello, Ethan.
MARTHA: ( a bit shakily ) Hello, Ethan.

ETHAN: How should I know?
AARON: But Mose Harper said.
ETHAN: That old goat still creakin' around?. Whyn't someone bury him?
ETHAN: Ben, ain't you?
ETHAN: ( frowning at Debbie ) Lucy, you ain't much bigger than when I saw you last.
DEBBIE: I'm Deborah! She's Lucy.

MOMENTO!: Martin checks his stride, stares in surprise.
MARTHA: ( contritely ) Martin!. Here we've been standing. Ethan, you haven't forgotten Martin?
ETHAN: Oh. Mistook you for a half-breed.
MARTIN: ( levelly ) Not quite. Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh. So they tell me.
ETHAN: You've done a lot of growin'.
AARON: It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was It just happened to be me. No need to make any more of it.

ETHAN: Hold on!
ETHAN: I'll take this.
MARTHA: Supper'll be ready by the time you wash up. Let me take your coat for you, Ethan.
MARTHA: ( smiling faintly ) And. welcome home.
ETHAN: The clock rattles alarmingly the usual preliminary to its striking; and then it bangs out the strokes like a fire-alarm gong. Eight fast clangs.
AARON: Ben! Deborah! Bed!
DEBBIE: But I've got to help with the dishes.
MARTHA: Not tonight. Ben, put that sword It's not a sword, ma. it's a saber! Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
BEN: It's not a sword, ma. it's a saber! Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
ETHAN: ( matter-of-factly ) How many damYankees, Uncle Ethan?
BEN: How many damYankees, Uncle Ethan?
MARTHA: Ben!. Martin, he'll sleep in the bunkhouse with you tonight.
MARTIN: Good night, Aunt Martha. Uncle Good night, Uncle Ethan.
ETHAN: Ben reluctantly puts the scabbard away, turns to Ethan.
BEN: Will you tell me tomorrow about the The war ended three years ago, boy!
AARON: The war ended three years ago, boy!
BEN: It did?. Then whyn't you come home before now?

DEBBIE: Lucy's wearing the gold locket you gave her when she was a little girl.
ETHAN: She don't wear it much account of it makes her neck green.
DEBBIE: She don't wear it much account of it makes her neck green.
LUCY: ( aghast ) ( defensively ) Well, it does. But I wouldn't care if you gave me a gold locket if it made my neck green or not.
DEBBIE: ( defensively ) Well, it does. But I wouldn't care if you gave me a gold locket if it made my neck green or not.
ETHAN: 'Fraid I.
ETHAN: How about this?
DEBBIE: Oh! LOOK! My gold locket!
MARTHA: It's solid gold. Ethan, I don't think she's old enough.
ETHAN: Let her keep it. Just something I picked up in Mexico. Oh, thank you, Uncle Ethan.
DEBBIE: Oh, thank you, Uncle Ethan.
LUCY: ( to Debbie ) Come along.
ETHAN: Passed the Todd place comin' in. What happened to 'em?
AARON: They gave up. went back to the cotton rows. So'd the Jamisons. Without Martha, I don't know. She wouldn't let a man quit.
AARON: ( change of tone ) Ethan, I could see it in you before the war. ( Ethan looks at him ) You wanted to clear out!
AARON: And you stayed out beyond all need to. WHY?
ETHAN: ( hard ) You askin' me to clear out now?
AARON: ( straightening with grave dignity ) You're my brother. You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to. Ain't that so, Martha?
MARTHA: ( almost a whisper ) Of course he is.
ETHAN: I expect to pay my own way.
ETHAN: There's sixty double eagles in there. twelve-hundred dollars.
ETHAN: An' twice that in here.
ETHAN: .only these got the late Emperor Maximilian's picture on 'em.
AARON: Mint fresh. not a mark on 'em.
ETHAN: Aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair. He raises the seat and lifts out a pair of old boots, some rags of clothing and then raises a false-bottom lid and drops pouch and money belt into it. Carefully he replaces everything. During this Ethan's attention has gone to Martha's hand, to one cut finger, its wound barely healed. He takes the hand gently.
ETHAN: Cut yourself?
ETHAN: ( softly ) You were always hurting about your
AARON: Time for bed. Night, Ethan. Come 'long, Martha.
AARON: Night, Ethan. Come 'long, Martha.
OMITTED: EXT. YARD OF THE EDWARDS' HOUSE - FAINT DAWN LIGHT Debbie's dog is barking excitedly as six horsemen slowly ride toward the house and dismount. A lamp goes on inside.
OMITTED: INT. THE EDWARDS' - ANGLE AT DOOR The door is opened by Aaron holding a lamp and a gun. He is only partly dressed pants, boots, undershirt. The bar of light slashes across the faces of Sam and some of the men behind him.
SAM'S VOICE: Aaron! Open up!. Sam Clayton!
AARON: Reverend. Come in!
CLAYTON: Sorry to get you out of bed so Mornin', Sister Edwards.

ETHAN: ( mockingly ) Captain the Reverend Samuel Johnson Clayton!. Mighty impressive.
CLAYTON: ( dourly ) Well. the prodigal brother. When'd you get back?

AARON: Ethan, countin' on you to look after things while I'm gone.
ETHAN: You ain't goin'.

ETHAN: ( angrily ) Well, swear him out again!. I'll go with you.
AARON: Now, Ethan, I ain't sure.
ETHAN: Don't argue!. And stay close. Maybe they're rustlers. and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong.
MOSE: Thankin' ye, Ethan. thankin' ye. Kind words.
CLAYTON: ( grudgingly ) All right. I'll swear you in.
ETHAN: You can forget that. Wouldn't be legal anyway.

ETHAN: You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
CLAYTON: I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
ETHAN: Got a warrant?
CLAYTON: You fit a lot of descriptions.
ETHAN: ( levelly ) I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time. I took mine to the Confederate States of America. ( he pauses then ) So did you, Reverend.
ETHAN: Stick close, Aaron.

WAIT!: She comes flying out of the house in her long flannel nightie and runs to Martin.
DEBBIE: Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
MARTIN: Grab hold!.
AARON'S VOICE: ( calling )
DEBORAH!: She turns and comes running back CAMERA PANNING to the little group on the porch; Ben in the door; Lucy crossing the porch; Aaron and Martha at the steps.
MARTIN: ( calling ) Uncle Ethan!
MARTIN: Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan.
ETHAN: Stop callin' me 'uncle'. I ain't your uncle.

OMITTED: EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - RISE OF GROUND - BRAD He is holding his rifle with both hands straight over his head and he repeats the signal until he sees they have seen him.
JORGENSEN'S VOICE: ( excitedly ) Brad! He's found them. Come on!
THE DISTANCE: as Jorgensen digs spurs and leads the way. The other riders MED. SHOT - BRAD - RISING GROUND - LATE AFTERNOON He waits grimly until he sees them coming, then wheels his mount and takes off over the hill.
ETHAN: Call that young fool back!
ETHAN: ( angrily ) Caddo or Kiowa, huh?. Ain't but one tribe uses a lance like that!
MOSE: ( almost a whisper ) Ay-he. Comanch!
BRAD: Killed every one an' not for food either. Why'd they do a thing like Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out. This here's a murder raid. It shapes up to scald out either your place. or my brother's.
ETHAN: Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out. This here's a murder raid. It shapes up to scald out either your place. or my brother's.
JORGENSEN: Mama!. Oh please. please no.

CLAYTON: Jorgensen's place is closest. If they're not there, we'll come straight
MARTIN: Well, come on!
ETHAN: ( he starts toward his horse ) It's forty miles, sonny. Horses can do with some grain and a little Comanch generally hits at moonrise.
MOSE: Comanch generally hits at moonrise.
MARTIN: Moonrise!. It'll be midnight before. I ain't waitin'.!
MOSE: Wisht it was Caddoes. or Kiowas.
THE DOOR: Debbie sits on the floor, playing with a little rag doll. The slanting blaze of the setting sun makes a brilliant area of light in which she is sitting. Beyond her, on the porch steps, Ben is squatting, whittling a piece of pine into a slingshot frame. We hear Martha and Lucy busy with the dishes. Aaron comes from behind CAMERA and stands in the doorway, absently rapping out his pipe. Near the doorway, on a wooden peg, hangs his gun, belt. He puts the pipe in his pocket and glances down at Deborah, intent on her play. He looks swiftly at where the women are busy - then stealthily eases the gun from its holster and slides it under his shirt. He hasn't made a sound and is sure he's got away with it. He clears his throat noisily and reaches for a light shotgun pegged above the door.
AARON: Think I'll see if I can pick off a sage-hen or two, Martha.
MARTHA: You do that, Aaron.
AARON: ( still pleased with himself ) Won't go far.
LUCY'S VOICE: My, the days are getting shorter!
MARTHA: ( sharply ) Lucy!. We don't need the lamp yet.
MARTHA: ( easily ) Let's enjoy the dusk a while.
ON PORCH: Aaron is slowly scanning the terrain.
AARON: ( to Ben ) Mind you sweep up them shavin's.
BEN: Yes, Pa. An' if you see any sage-hens, I'm
AARON: He is walking through the scrub and brush grass, every sense alive and straining. He pauses every three or four strides casting each quadrant in turn. Once he whips, gun ready, as a sage-hen or quail whirrs up not far from him. He smiles grimly as he watches it fly away. He keeps on.
BEN: ( quietly ) It's all right, ma. I been watchin'. Only I wish.
MARTHA: ( quietly ) What, Ben?
BEN: I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
LUCY: Mother, I can't see what I'm doing!.
MARTHA: NOT YET, LUCY!.
SUNSET: NOTE TO W. HOCH: What J.F. has in mind for this and the following scenes is the same kind of dramatic use of red you achieved in "Yellow Ribbon" in the scene telling of Custer's They are standing in the ruddy glare of the sunset and Ben has Ethan's sabre in his hand. We hear Aaron coming at a run, breathing hard. Ben takes a step as though to go to him, but Martha's hand at once is on his shoulder. Aaron gains the porch.
AARON: In the house, boy. and.
AARON: Ben, close the shutters.
LUCY: One shutter closes and the bar of light they were standing in goes out. Martha, Aaron and Lucy are dark silhouettes now against the red beam from another window.
MARTHA: ( sudden fear ) Where's Deborah?. ( calling it )
DEBORAH!: Debbie emerges from a shadowed corner into a beam of light. She is clutching her rag doll, nibbling a cookie. She holds it for them to see.
DEBBIE: I only took one, ma. Topsy was
NIGHT: Aaron is little more than a shadowy silhouette as he peers into the night through a partly-opened shutter. Suddenly the room leaps alight as Lucy opens an inner door and enters, holding a lighted lamp. Aaron closes the shutter, spins on her angrily.
AARON: Martha crosses the room swiftly and blows out the lamp. In the brief moment the room has been lighted, we see that Lucy is carrying a dark shawl in one hand; that Ben is crouched at another window rifle ready; and that Deborah is on her feet standing like a child who is being dressed.
LUCY!: Martha crosses the room swiftly and blows out the lamp. In the brief moment the room has been lighted, we see that Lucy is carrying a dark shawl in one hand; that Ben is crouched at another window rifle ready; and that Deborah is on her feet standing like a child who is being dressed.
LUCY: I'm sorry. I couldn't find the Hurry, Martha. Moon's fixin' to We're going to play the sleep-out game. Remember?. Where you hide out with grandma?
AARON: Hurry, Martha. Moon's fixin' to We're going to play the sleep-out game. Remember?. Where you hide out with grandma?
MARTHA: ( softly to the child ) We're going to play the sleep-out game. Remember?. Where you hide out with grandma?
DEBBIE: Where's she buried?
MARTHA: And you'll go along the ditch very quietly like a.
DEBBIE: Like a little mouse.
AARON: He reaches for the child, but he has to wait for Martha's last embrace.
MARTHA: There!. And you won't come back or make a sound. no matter what you hear? Promise!. No matter what?
DEBBIE: I promise. Wait!
AARON: Child, child!
DEBBIE: Can't I have Topsy to keep me company?
AARON: There's no time.
MARTHA: Here she is, baby. Baby.
AARON: Down low go!
AARON: ( hoarse whisper ) Here dog. here!
AARON: She reached the ditch.
AARON: She'll be all right, mother. she'll be all right.
NIGHT: Nothing stirs and we hear nothing. Then, with faintest little rustle, Debbie comes snaking along the ground into the hollow between the two graves and lies there face down, pressed against Topsy. She becomes one with the earth and the stillness. And then the moonlight strikes the tips of the scrub growth and as a cloud scuds by, the moonlight reveals something glittering like beads. And the CAMERA from that ground-level shot
OMITTED: EXT. RISING GROUND - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN - MOONLIGHT He stands beside his spent and fallen horse. Its breathing is a rasping whistle. Martin tries to haul its head up. Useless. Breathing hard himself, his face ashen in the moonlight, Martin looks desperately off in the direction of the ranch. Then he jerks the rifle from its saddle scabbard struggling with it because it is under the horse. He freezes then listening. And we hear the steady beat of two horsemen approaching. Martin knows who they are and his face is alive with hope. He gets the rifle free at last and goes running toward the oncoming riders.
MARTIN: ( shouting ) Ethan!. Ethan!
MARTIN: ( waving ) Uncle Ethan. it's me. Martin!
ETHAN: Out of my way!
MOONLIGHT: ( desperately ) Mose! Wait!.
MARTIN: ( desperately ) Mose! Wait!.
MARTIN: Ethan!. Mose!.
ETHAN: ( harshly ) You stay out!
ETHAN: Nothing for you to see.
MARTIN: Ethan turns him and drives a brutal right to his jaw. Martin goes down out cold. And only now do we understand how merciful the blow was as Ethan looks compassionately at the fallen figure.
ETHAN: Don't let him go in there, Mose.
ETHAN: ( calling ) Lucy Lucy!
HERE LIES: MARY JANE EDWARDS KILLED BY COMANCHES
CLAYTON: .and to Your keeping we commend the souls of Aaron. Martha. and Benjamin Edwards. Man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble.

ETHAN: ( harshly ) Amen!. Put an 'amen' to it!
CLAYTON: .like a flower and is cut down.
CLAYTON: Charlieyou and Brad ride point! .Don't get too far ahead.
JORGENSEN: Ethan is about to mount when Mrs. Jorgensen comes up and catches his arm.
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( he turns impatiently ) Those girls mean as much to me as though they were my own. Maybe you don't know my Brad's been sittin' up with Lucy. and my Laurie's real fond of Martin.
ETHAN: ( impatiently ) I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
MRS. JORGENSEN: I am. I am. It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls. And if the girls are. dead. Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
MRS. JORGENSEN: Promise me, Ethan!
ETHAN: ( harshly ) Come on, if you're comin'.
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( a heartbroken murmur ) Oh, Martin. Martin.
MARTIN: We'll find them, Mrs. Jorgensen. We'll find them. I almost hope they don't find them!
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( slowly ) I almost hope they don't find them!
63A: MARTIN - Next to last in file. Finally:
63B: ETHAN - His face a study of relentless purpose.
CLAYTON: Another one, eh?
CHARLIE: This 'un come a long way 'fore he Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
CLAYTON: Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
NESBY: I don't like it.
CLAYTON: What don't you like?
NESBY: Injun's on a raid generly hides their dead so you won't know how many they've lost. If they don't care about us knowin', it only spells one thing. they ain't afraid of us followin' or of us catchin' up with 'em either.
ETHAN: You can back out any time, Nesby.
NESBY: Didn't say that. What's he doin' that for.
CHARLIE: He wants to be sure.
BRAD: ( grim ) Let's get along.
ETHAN: ( to Brad ) Why don't you finish the job?
CLAYTON: ( gravely ) What good does that do?
ETHAN: By what you preach. none!
ETHAN: But by what the Comanche believe now he can't enter the spirit land, but has got to wander forever between the winds. because I took his mangy
OMITTED: EXT. NIGHT CAMP - RAVINE - CLOSE SHOT - BRAD AND MARTIN Brad is looking out into the night strain and tension in every line. Beyond them we may see some of the other men sitting or sprawled on the ground near a sheltered fire.
BRAD: ( a whisper ) If only she's alive. I'll make it up to her. No matter what's happened. I'll make her forget. She's just got to be alive.
ETHAN: Get some rest!
SUNSET: The four faces are just over the ridge, peering at something far distant, far below.
MOSE: Could be a buffler.
BRAD: It's horses, I tell ya.
ETHAN: It's them all right.
ETHAN: They're camped by the river 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before daybreak.
CLAYTON: ( slowly ) You're right sure you want to jump 'em, Ethan?
ETHAN: ( touch of defiance ) It's what we're here for, ain't it?
CLAYTON: I thought we were trying to get the girls back alive. We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em. You know that!
BRAD: ( bewildered, angry ) But. but what are we doin' then?. What are we supposed to do?
CLAYTON: What I had in mind was runnin' off their hoss herd. A Comanche on foot is more apt to be willin' to That makes sense to me.
NESBY: That makes sense to me.
MARTIN: ( angrily ) What do you know about it?. What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him. You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as.
ETHAN: ( angrily ) What do you know about it?. What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him. You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as.
CLAYTON: .as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em. I say we do it my way, Ethan. and that's an order!

ETHAN: You got any more orders, Captain?
CLAYTON: ( quietly ) Just keep goin'.
MOSE: ( in soft apology ) Jus' bein' sociable, Cap'n.
CLAYTON: ( softly ) Keep goin'.
BRAD: ( tensely )
CLAYTON: EXT. CANYON COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - PAST THE SEARCHERS Another Indian file of eight angles out of a different canyon and begins to cut in toward the group riding slowly, very quietly. Clayton slightly alters course, veering slightly away from the converging files, but still riding slowly. And then, from ahead but at a 100 yards, another Comanche group seems to rise out of the ground and slowly begins closing the gap.
ETHAN: ( to Clayton ) If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
CLAYTON: How far's the river from here, Mose?
MOSE: I been baptized, Reverend. yes suh, been baptized, thank ye.
CLAYTON: Well, you better brace yourself for another one. Ya-HEE!
CLAYTON: And once again he spins his mount and takes off, across the river, followed by the others.
CLAYTON: ( shouting his orders ) This is as good as any. Charlie, you and Ed take the horses.
MOSE: ( chattily ) Minds me o' the time Joe Powers an' me fit us some Kiowas.
MARTIN: You think they mean to charge us, Uncle Ethan.?
MOSE: .We found us an ole buffler

MOSE: Ay-he. That's jest what I tole Joe Powers. That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?

CLAYTON: ( grimly ) You got one now!
ETHAN: Slack your shoulders. Slack 'em. Your hands'll take care of
MOSE: ( cackling ) There goes yer scalp, Ethan!.
ETHAN: I still got one out there.
OMITTED: EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - CLOSE SHOT - BEHIND ETHAN The angle is along his rifle barrel as it beads on one of the racing Comanches trying to pick up the dead Indian. Clayton's big hand grasps the rifle barrel.
CLAYTON'S VOICE: ( quietly ) No, Ethan.
CLAYTON: Let them bury their dead.
ETHAN: That tears it, Reverend. From now on, you keep out. All of you!. I don't want you with me. I don't need you. for what I got to do!
CHARLIE: ( quietly ) No need to shout, mister.
CHARLIE: Reckon we got to go back Ed's shoulder is smashed bad!

MARTIN: Sorry. We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch. Maybe they split up.
ETHAN: They're with 'em if they're still
BRAD: You've said that enough!. Maybe Lucy's dead. maybe they're both dead. but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
ETHAN: ( an aside ) That'll be the day!. Let's ride.

BRAD: Why'd they break off? Was there water in that canyon?
ETHAN: Huh.? No. no water.

ETHAN: ( more like his usual gruff self ) Sure I'm all right.
MARTIN: Say!. What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
ETHAN: Must've. Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it.
BRAD: ( shouting it ) I saw her!. I saw Lucy!
BRAD: ( continuing ) They're camped 'bout two miles over. I was just swingin' back when I saw their smoke. I bellied up a ridge an' they was right below me.
MARTIN: Did you see Debbie?
BRAD: No, but I saw Lucy all right. She was wearin' that blue dress. an' she was walkin' along.
ETHAN: ( voice flat ) What you saw wasn't Lucy.
BRAD: It was, I tell you!
ETHAN: What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress. I found Lucy back there in that canyon. I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands. I thought it best to keep it from you long as I could.
BRAD: Did they.? Was she.?
ETHAN: ( blazing ) What've I got to do draw you a picture?. Spell it out?. Don't ever ask me!. Long as you live don't ever ask me more!
MARTIN: ( frantically )
BRAD: He comes pounding down a slope, and he takes off his hat and skims it away. He rips off a neckerchief as though to relieve the rush of raging blood.
ETHAN: Let's just hope he took some with
MARTIN: What you goin' to do?
ETHAN: Get some sleep. Tomorrow's another
OMITTED: EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LOW ANGLE SHOT - DAY A study of horseprints etched in the soil the mark of the passage of many horses; perhaps an eagle or turkey feather fallen from a warbonnet. And then we hear and see the approach of two plodding horses, and the dusty boots of the horsemen Ethan and Martin following the trail. The Search Theme resumes and continues over the next three shots, helping us suggest the passage of time, the change of scene.
OMITTED: EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LOW ANGLE SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - It is a portrait study of two faces etched by wind and privation and cold into tragic, fanatic masks. Martin has aged years in a matter of months. Falling snow flakes touch their faces and begin to rime their stubbly
AFTERNOON: It is a portrait study of two faces etched by wind and privation and cold into tragic, fanatic masks. Martin has aged years in a matter of months. Falling snow flakes touch their faces and begin to rime their stubbly
MARTIN: ( bitterly ) Say it. We're beat!
ETHAN: ( slowly ) No. our turnin' back don't change anything. not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe. for a while. They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to.
MARTIN: And you think we got a chance to find her?
ETHAN: An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough. Then he quits. Same when he runs. Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on. So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that. We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
FADE OUT: FADE IN EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE AND APPROACH - WIDE ANGLE - The time is spring. It is a year and a half later. The Jorgensen house is larger than the Edwards place of sod and logs, with a covered breezeway connecting the two separate buildings of the house: one being the keeping room, the other the sleeping quarters of the numerous Jorgensen brood. A meadowlark breaks into his sudden song. A dog or two come barking around the side of the house as Ethan and Martin ride slowly from behind CAMERA toward the house. In that instant a lamp is lighted within the house and Lars Jorgensen comes to the door.

ETHAN: ( to Jorgensen ) You got my letter about your son, Yah. Just about this time a year It came the day before his. The Lord giveththe Lord taketh I ain't fit to go indoors, miz Jorgensen. These clothes is.
JORGENSEN: Yah. Just about this time a year It came the day before his. The Lord giveththe Lord taketh I ain't fit to go indoors, miz Jorgensen. These clothes is.
MRS. JORGENSEN: It came the day before his. The Lord giveththe Lord taketh I ain't fit to go indoors, miz Jorgensen. These clothes is.
JORGENSEN: The Lord giveththe Lord taketh I ain't fit to go indoors, miz Jorgensen. These clothes is.
MARTIN: I ain't fit to go indoors, miz Jorgensen. These clothes is.
LAURIE: She kisses him hard and full on the mouth and has no eyes for anyone else. Mrs. Jorgensen looks on with amusement. Martin is just bowled over.
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( teasing ) And him probably forgettin' all about you!. Probably can't even call your name to mind.
MARTIN: ( smiling )
MARTIN: ( continuing ) But I fairly forgot just how pretty you was.
MRS. JORGENSEN: The little one?. Debbie?
MARTIN: Hey. What you doin'.? Don't go takin' that stuff.
MARTIN: ( a yelp ) Don't go takin' that stuff.
LAURIE: Ain't worth the mendin'.
LAURIE: What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?. I have brothers, haven't I?
MARTIN: Well I ain't one of 'em!
LAURIE: I'm a woman, Martie. We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives. When you're little we even wash you. How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know.
MARTIN: You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid.
LAURIE: Wouldn't bother me. I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you.
ETHAN: .an' then it snowed and we lost the trail. No need to tell ya all the places we went. Fort Richardson, Fort Wingate an' Cobb. the Anadarko Agency. Trouble is we don't even know which band that war party belonged to.
MRS. JORGENSEN: Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
ETHAN: I got your boy killed.
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( gently ) Don't go blamin' yourself.
JORGENSEN: ( angrily ) It's this country killed my boy!. Yes, by golly!
MRS. JORGENSEN: Now Lars!. It so happens we be Texicans. We took a reachin' hold, way far out, past where any man has right or reason to hold on. Or if we didn't, our folks did. So we can't leave off without makin' them out to be fools, wastin' their lives 'n wasted in the way they died. A Texican's nothin' but a human man out on a limb. This year an' next and maybe for a hundred more. But I don't think it'll be forever. Someday this country will be a fine good place to be. Maybe it needs our bones in the ground before that time can come.
LAURIE: Ma!. Martie's drawers is a sight! Ain't fit for rags!. Would it be all right if we gave him some of Brad's things?
MRS. JORGENSEN: Why.'course it would! They're in the chest.
JORGENSEN: ( rising excitedly ) By golly, the letter. In the chest, mama. It came for you, Ethan. last winter.
JORGENSEN: ( continuing ) Joab Wilkes of the Rangers brought
ETHAN: ( quietly ) Mrs. Jorgensen. Will you look at this?
ETHAN: Will you look at this?
MRS. JORGENSEN: Why it's just a snip of calico.
ETHAN: You ever see it before. like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
MRS. JORGENSEN: Yes!. Yes, I remember!. Have they found her, Ethan?
ETHAN: No. not yet.
ETHAN: ( continuing ) .not yet.
MARTIN: Might at least have left me my pants!
LAURIE: Shush!. Time for bed anyway. Likely these'll need some takin' in. Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! .Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and.
JORGENSEN'S VOICE: ( calling ) Laurie!. Come. come!
LAURIE: Yes, Pa!. Good night, Martie. good night, Mr. Edwards.
MARTIN: Good night. Laurie.
ETHAN: Good night.
ETHAN: Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own.
MARTIN: ( staring ) YOUR cattle?. DEBBIE'S cattle!
ETHAN: He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone. I'll be pushin' on tomorrow.
MARTIN: I ain't stayin'. I set out lookin' for Debbie. I aim to keep on.
ETHAN: Because she's my. my.
MARTIN: Because she's my. my.
ETHAN: She's your nothin'. She's no kin to you at all!
MARTIN: I always felt like she was. Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own.
ETHAN: That don't make 'em kin.
MARTIN: All right. I ain't got no kin. I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em. You ain't even got money to buy cartridges. Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here.
ETHAN: How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em. You ain't even got money to buy cartridges. Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here.
ETHAN: Martin. I want you to know Yeah. you want me to know I ain't got no kin no money no horses nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!. You tole me that already. Now shut your head!
MARTIN: ( turning mad as hell ) Yeah. you want me to know I ain't got no kin no money no horses nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!. You tole me that already. Now shut your head!
ETHAN: Good night.
DAWN LIGHT: She is in a robe made of an Indian blanket, belted snugly around her waist. She wears moccasins for slippers. Her flannel nightgown is high at the collar and almost trails the floor. She is at the stove, frying bacon and eggs; a coffee pot is on the boil. Beyond her the door to the grandmother room opens and Martin comes in dressed in Brad's clothes. His eyes whip around the room. Laurie doesn't turn as he slowly approaches.
LAURIE: ( quietly ) Ethan rode on. an hour ago.
LAURIE: I don't know what you can do about finding Debbie that he can't.
LAURIE: He'll find her now, Martie. Please believe me. I know. That's what scares me him findin'
MARTIN: That's what scares me him findin'
MARTIN: Laurie, I've seen his eyes when he so much as hears the word 'Comanche' .I've seen him take his knife an' .never mind. But he's a man can go crazy wild. It might come on him when it was the worst thing could be. What I counted on, I hoped to be there to stop him, if such thing
LAURIE: ( slowly ) I hoped I could hold you here. But I guess I knew. So I stole this for you.
MARTIN: 'I bought a small size dress off a Injun. If this here is a piece of yr chiles dress bring reward. I know where they gone. Jerem Futterman.'
MARTIN: ( excited ) Futterman!. He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos. Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa Finish your breakfast.
LAURIE: Finish your breakfast.
MARTIN: I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
LAURIE: ( almost in tears but angry ) Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud. an' you can take the light gelding with the But that's Sweet-face your own good horse.
MARTIN: But that's Sweet-face your own good horse.
LAURIE: ( hysterically ) Take it and welcome. but don't count on finding me here when you get back. I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you. I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
MARTIN: ( miserably ) I can't help it, Laurie. I just gotta catch up with Ethan.
MORNING: ANGLING from behind Laurie in the doorway as Martin, riding one horse, leading another, goes galloping away.
MAN: Andale! Andale!
FUTTERMAN: He sets the jug down, picks up one of the glasses so grey and thumb-printed it is almost opaque. Both Ethan and Martin regard it with disgust. Futterman gives a slight shrug, takes the dress and starts to wipe the dirty glass with it. Martin snatches it out of his hand.
ETHAN: ( harshly ) How'd you come by this?
FUTTERMAN: You said there'd be a thousand dollar That's what I said.
ETHAN: That's what I said.
FUTTERMAN: You got it with you?
ETHAN: Reward'll be paid when I find her an' if she's alive.
FUTTERMAN: Man's got a right to expect some kind o' payment. I laid out for the dress an' sendin' you the
ETHAN: Twenty Yankee dollars.
FUTTERMAN: .an' a man's time is worth A young buck fetched it in late last Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar.
ETHAN: A young buck fetched it in late last Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar.
FUTTERMAN: A young buck fetched it in late last Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar.
ETHAN: Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
FUTTERMAN: Me neither. But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
ETHAN: Keep talking.
FUTTERMAN: Scar's band was headin' north. to winter in at Fort Wingate. eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said. Maybe he lied.
ETHAN: And maybe you lie.
FUTTERMAN: In that case you won't find her and I won't get my thousand dollars.
FUTTERMAN: ( too casually ) Stay the night if you want. ( Ethan shakes his head ) Cards?. A jug?. If you'd like some company, we got a few squaws on the place.
ETHAN: No thanks. Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
FUTTERMAN: Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
ETHAN: Ain't yours yet.
FUTTERMAN: ( slight smile ) Bad manners. He shoulda said 'good-
MARTIN'S VOICE: Acts like somethin's out there.
ETHAN: ( heading toward campfire ) Smells a change in the weather.
ETHAN: Wouldn't surprise me if we didn't have a frost 'fore mornin'. Here. Whyn't you bed down closer to the fire, boy?
MARTIN: Hey! What's the idea.?
ETHAN: Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper my bones is cold tonight.
MARTIN: Funny. When we passed through Fort Wingate last winter, we didn't hear mention of any Nawyecky Comanche
ETHAN: Not so funny. if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means.
MARTIN: What's that?
ETHAN: Sorta like 'roundabout' like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse.
MARTIN: ( drowsily ) You all settled an' comfortable now?
ETHAN: You all settled an' comfortable now?
HIS HENCHMEN: At a crouch or crawling, the three worm their way among some rocks until they reach a slight rise looking down into the camp. Martin is asleep and next to him is Ethan's dummy, hat over its face, and the fire still burning. The two henchmen snake their rifles up to a firing position. A shot cracks. and one man is knocked flat on his face. The other whirls in the direction of the shot, his rifle swinging in search of a target. A second shot splits the night and the breed falls as though hit by a giant fist. Martin is sitting up now, staring wildly around. Futterman starts to run down-slope, away from the hidden marksman, dodging between the rocks. A third shot catches him in the back and he spins and falls and rolls down the slope into the firepit camp area. Martin is on his feet now.
ETHAN: Thanks. you did just fine.
MARTIN: ( dazed ) He just couldn't wait.
ETHAN: He just couldn't wait.
MARTIN: ( watching him go through pockets ) Whatchu doin'?.
ETHAN: Even got my twenty dollars back. We did all right.
MARTIN: WE?. You just used me for bait staked me out like a. buildin' up the fire. fixin' it so's. I coulda had my brains blowed out!
MARTIN: ( explosively ) Suppose you'd missed!
ETHAN: Never occurred to me.
CHARLIE: ( calling it ) Howdy, Mister Jorgensen.
JORGENSEN: MacCorry swings off his saddle near the porch, as the door opens and Mrs. Jorgensen comes out shawled against the Jorgensen lets the cordwood drop.
CHARLIE: Got a letter here.
JORGENSEN: By golly! A letter?
CHARLIE: For Miss Laurie.
MRS. JORGENSEN: Come in, Charlie, come in. LAURIE!. My land!. Two letters in the one year!.
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( to Laurie ) A letter for you, Laurie.
CHARLIE: Yes'm. Figgered it might be the news you been waitin' for. so.
MRS. JORGENSEN: Real good o' you to ride all the way over, Charlie. Might at least say your thank you's, Laurie. Declare!
CHARLIE: No need to.
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( expectantly ) Laurie! Don't keep a body just
JORGENSEN: ( expectantly ) Laurie! Don't keep a body just
MRS. JORGENSEN: Laurie! Don't keep a body just
LAURIE: ( impatiently ) I was just readin' to see if. Anyway, it's MY letter!
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( agreeably ) 'Course it is. Now let's all get comfortable an' set so's we can listen while Laurie reads her letter.
CHARLIE: ( turning as if to go ) Maybe I'd better be goin'.
JORGENSEN: You stay, Charlie. After all, Charlie brought the letter, Laurie. He got a right to listen too!
LAURIE: ( surrendering ) Oh, all right! Well. Martin says.
JORGENSEN: From the beginning.
LAURIE: 'Dear Miss Laury'. He spells it with a Y instead of an I. E. Wouldn't you think he'd know.
JORGENSEN: Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
LAURIE: Dear Miss Laury. I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Comanches the late Mister Futterman told us about.
LAURIE: The late Mister Futterman?
JORGENSEN: That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
MRS. JORGENSEN: Wonder what happened to the poor man. Go on, Laurie.
LAURIE: ( resuming the letter ) We cut north through Indian territory ( her voice fades )
MARTIN'S VOICE: Soon we was meeting up with Kiowas an' Wichitas an' even some Comanches camped by one of the agencies.
MARTIN'S VOICE: But none of them was Nawyecky's nor claimed to know a war chief named Scar. He's the one the late Mister Futterman said had Debbie.
MARTIN'S VOICE: At one o' the agencies we outfitted with all kind an' manner of trade goods. figgerin' that'd make it easier for us to come an' go. You'd laugh if I told you what was our biggest seller.
FIRST AWARD: LARD TYPE HOG
DAY: As the Indian proudly steps back, we see beyond him a half dozen other braves all rosetted. Ethan looks them over complacently while Martin to hide the smile that threatens to split his face bends to pick up a huge bundle of furs.
FAVORING LAURIE: reading the letter. She is at the bottom of a page.
LAURIE: 'There is one other thing I got to tell you before you hear it from Ethan. How I got myself a wife'.
LAURIE: A WIFE?
A WIFE?: She looks at them - dazed.
CHARLIE: ( delightedly ) He did?
JORGENSEN: ( smacking his knee very happy indeed ) Good! A young man should get married early in life. Right, mama?
JORGENSEN: Every young man should at least once.Go on, Laurie! Read!
LAURIE: ( haltingly ) A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW! ( aghast )
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( aghast )
JORGENSEN: ( sternly ) Is no way to treat a letter, Laurie .Mama maybe you better read it. ( to Charlie, proudly ) My wife was a school teacher, Charlie .She reads good.
LAURIE: I'll read it.
CHARLIE: ( smugly ) So he married a Comanche squaw. Haw haw haw!
INCLUDING ETHAN: who rides in slowly, leading their pack horse and Martin's The name registers with some of the nearer braves. There is a quick interchange of glances, frowning, hostile.
ETHAN: ( quietly ) Let's go. I think I stumbled onto ( eagerly )
MARTIN: ( eagerly )
ETHAN: ( angrily ) When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
MARTIN: But I just bought a good blanket.
ETHAN: ( curtly ) Forget it.
ETHAN: What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago.
MARTIN: ( excitedly ) Think it might be.?
ETHAN: What's she followin' for?
MARTIN: Look, I changed my mind. You can keep your blanket.
MARTIN: Go on back.
MARTIN: Look. you don't understand. I don't want it.
ETHAN: ( explosively ) YOU don't understand, ya chunkhead! You didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought ( aghast ) You got yourself a wife, sonny!
MARTIN: ( aghast ) You got yourself a wife, sonny!
ETHAN: You got yourself a wife, sonny!
MARTIN: ( a wail ) Oh no! Tell her she's got to go And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?. No sir! Come on, Mrs.
ETHAN: And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?. No sir! Come on, Mrs.
MARTIN: Mrs. Pauley?
ETHAN: ( singing ) I got another gal purtier'n you. I got another gal purtier'n you. I got another gal purtier'n you. Skip to my Lou, my darlin'.
MARTIN: ( in Comanche )
ETHAN: That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife.
MARTIN: Cut it out, will ya.
MARTIN: Look. I wish I could explain to
LOOK: Now she jabbers in Comanche and, at the appropriate time, will point to the sky and imitate a bird flying.
LOOK: Nay tzare T'sala-ta-komal-ta-name. unt kang-yah Look. ( My father calls me Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky. but you call me 'Look' ).
ETHAN: Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky. but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya.
MARTIN: ( blankly )
MARTIN: ( hotly ) I don't think it's so funny. If you want to do some good, whyn't you ask her where Scar is?
ETHAN: ( grimly ) She heard ya-all right. An' she
ETHAN: Unt osupanet cah-nay Scar?
ETHAN: You ask her!
MARTIN: ( she faces him ) ( sign talk ) Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him. a white girl nai-bist pabo taibo.
LOOK: Mah nee-koo-ur?
MARTIN: ( shaking head ) No. not my wife. My. ( to Ethan ) How do you say sister?
ETHAN: ( in Comanche )
MORNING: It is the same scene the following morning. The men are standing above where Look had bedded for the night, looking at the ground. Clearly marked on the hard ground is a crudely drawn arrow.
MARTIN: Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing.
ETHAN: She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain. not if she took off where the arrow points.
MARTIN: Think she means for us to follow?
ETHAN: How should I know. She's YOUR wife!
MARTIN: I think maybe we oughta.
ETHAN: ( hiding a grin ) Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that. Bein' a new husband and all.
LAURIE: Maybe she left other signs for us to follow but we'll never know 'cause it snowed all day and all the next week. We were heading north, through the buffalo country when something happened that I ain't got straight in my own mind yet.
FOOTAGE ): The two men are picking their way through a snow-mantled grove. Martin's voice resumes the narration.
MARTIN'S VOICE: Ethan's always been throwing it up to me that I'm a quarter-breed. I never figgered it made much But this day we came on a small herd. We needed some meat so we circled .and came up on 'em afoot. They hadn't been hunted, so it was no trick workin' in close.
MARTIN'S VOICE: But this day we came on a small herd. We needed some meat so we circled .and came up on 'em afoot. They hadn't been hunted, so it was no trick workin' in close.
MARTIN'S VOICE: .and came up on 'em afoot. They hadn't been hunted, so it was no trick workin' in close.
MARTIN'S VOICE: Ethan got a nice one on his first shot, but then he began killing one after another cows as well as bulls fast as he could fire and load. It was just a slaughter. no sense to it.
MARTIN: Ethan, quit it!
ETHAN: ( firing again ) ( another shot ) What's the sense in it!
MARTIN: What's the sense in it!
ETHAN: ( in a fury ) Hunger! Empty bellies! That's the sense in it, you Cherokee!.
ETHAN: Least, THEY won't feed any Comanches this winter. Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, Ain't that too bad. If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours.
MARTIN: Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, Ain't that too bad. If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours.
ETHAN: Ain't that too bad. If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours.
MARTIN: Ethan turns. Now faintly, little more than a shred of sound, is the distant blowing of a bugle.
ETHAN!: Ethan turns. Now faintly, little more than a shred of sound, is the distant blowing of a bugle.
MARTIN: Listen!. Hear it?. There! Ain't that a bugle. and firing?
ETHAN: ( grimly ) Just hope we ain't too late.

DAY: MARTIN'S VOICE ( as narrator )
MARTIN'S VOICE: ( as narrator ) It was all over long before we got there and the soldiers was high- tailin' it back to the agency with their prisoners squaws mostly by the time Ethan and me reached the
MARTIN'S VOICE: It was the Nawyecky Comanches all right the ones we'd been looking for all this time.
DAY: as they ride in, passing dead horses, a few bodies of men.
MARTIN'S VOICE: Trouble of it was that the soldiers had hit when most of the fightin' men was away huntin' maybe. So most of the dead was old men and women an' kids. And it was in one of the tepees Ethan found her the little squaw who wanted me to call her Look. Well, you're a widower now.
ETHAN: Well, you're a widower now.
MARTIN: ( angrily ) What'd the soldiers have to kill her
MARTIN: Ethan, who has turned indifferently to leave, pauses. Martin shows him what Look had been clutching Debbie's rag doll.
MARTIN: Look! It's hers, Debbie's.
MARTIN'S VOICE: So we knew Debbie had been in the village. What Look was doing there whether she'd come to warn them, or maybe to find Debbie for me. there's no way of knowing.
MARTIN: We gotta catch up with them yellow legs. Maybe they got her with them.
ETHAN: ( harshly ) And maybe they got Scar!
DAY: A long line stretching across the landscape women falling and being prodded along by their captors. From behind CAMERA ride Ethan and Martin and move to intercept the column.
OFFICER: ( inquiringly ) We're looking for a girl a white She'd be about thirteen now.
ETHAN: We're looking for a girl a white She'd be about thirteen now.
MARTIN: She'd be about thirteen now.
OFFICER: We got two around that age.
MARTIN: ( eagerly ) You'll have to wait until we reach the agency. Fall in behind the ( protestingly ) But couldn't you.?
OFFICER: You'll have to wait until we reach the agency. Fall in behind the But couldn't you.?
MARTIN: ( protestingly ) But couldn't you.?
OFFICER: ( shouting it ) Keep the column moving!. Close ranks there!
GENERAL: And it was clear to me the hostiles outnumbered us four to one. with all the advantage of terrain.
CORRESPONDENT: Four to one! What did you do, general?
GENERAL: ( impressively ) Sir we charged!. Gentlemen and I hope you will quote me I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp.
ETHAN: ( blurting it ) Cheyenne! What Cheyenne?
GENERAL: ( turning and staring ) I beg your pardon?
ETHAN: That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche. Chief Scar's bunch.
CORRESPONDENT: ( fascinated ) Scar? What a wonderful name!.
GENERAL: ( to his aide ) Are you getting this, Keefer?
CORRESPONDENT: ( to Ethan ) How do you spell that word
ETHAN: My name's Edwards. I'm looking for my niece. she was in that camp when you attacked.
GENERAL: ( uncertain ) Well. I know there were some captives recovered.
MARTIN: ( bitterly ) Four of 'em dead. so we were told.
GENERAL: ( uncomfortably ) Unfortunately, the hostiles murdered them as we developed the village.
ETHAN: Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
GENERAL: Keefer!. Put this man under arrest!
ETHAN: That'll be the day. 'As we developed the village'. Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are. You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
KEEFER: Shall I show him the captives, sir?
GENERAL: Just get him out of here!
KEEFER: Yes sir. This way.
AFTERNOON: The door is opened by a guard and Ethan takes a step into the room then stops in manifest shock. Martin is at his heels, eager and expectant. Beyond them stands Keefer, grave and compassionate. There is a keening sound in the room almost an animal sound.
MARTIN: Debbie?. DEBBIE?
MARTIN: Don't be scared, ma'am.
KEEFER: Just don't pay any attention to her.
MARTIN: ( softly )
GIRL: ( White man! ) The other girl has risen almost in the same instant but more out of fear. She is younger, but painted like the other. She moves to stand behind the savage one.
MARTIN: ( slowly ) No. She's not.
ETHAN: I ain't sure. Where's that doll?
KEEFER: Was your niece about their age?
ETHAN: Not far from it.
KEEFER: Hard to realize they're white, isn't They're not white any more they're Comanche!. Let's see the bodies.
ETHAN: ( grimly ) They're not white any more they're Comanche!. Let's see the bodies.
ETHAN: I don't need you.
KEEFER: ( the dispassionate pro ) I'd like you to see them all. It might help us identify them. Shot in the head flash-burn range. The boy got his skull cracked. Here's the girl.
ETHAN: Martin relaxes. and in that instant the madwoman has the doll in her hands. She cradles it and she croons. Martin reaches to take it away. But she calmly sits, cradling the doll, and rocks to and fro, humming a lullaby. He can't take it. Ethan returns.
ETHAN: Well, we only got the one lead Scar. And where we begin to look, I don't know.
KEEFER: There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp. cheap stuff. trade goods. Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican. Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border. What do they call themselves?
ETHAN: That's the breed. Course it might take time.
KEEFER: That's the breed. Course it might take time.
ETHAN: Time's running out. But I'm obliged to you.
EVENING: Laurie has reached the last page of the letter, reading it by the lamp on the table. Jorgensen is knocking out the dead ashes of his pipe. Charlie is in the shadows, a guitar in his hands not playing it, but occasionally softly picking a note or chord. Mrs. Jorgensen is dabbing moist eyes with a corner of her apron.
LAURIE: .so we're setting out for New Mexico Territory in the morning. I am sorry I won't be back for Christmas again this year.
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( quick sympathy ) And you knittin' that muffler.
LAURIE: ( impatiently ) What's the difference!
MRS. JORGENSEN: Well, I just thought it would be a sin and a shame not to let SOMEONE get some good of it.
LAURIE: ( peering closely ) There's a word crossed out. It looks like 'I wish' or 'I will'. ( she gives up ) Anyway. 'I set pen aside in the hope you are enjoying good health and your folks the same. I remain, ( forlornly ) yours truly, Martin Paulie.'
JORGENSEN: They never find that girl.
LAURIE: ( half to herself ) Yours truly. ( hotly ) And he even has to write his full name. Martin Pauley. not even just Martie!. ( she stands ) I don't care if he never comes back!
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( rising saying it without conviction ) Now, Laurie!.
MRS. JORGENSEN: Charlie, you'll stay for supper?. Now I won't take no for an answer.
CHARLIE: Thought of saying 'no' never crossed my mind, Miz Jorgensen. No place I'd rather be than right here, right
CHARLIE: ( singing ) One old boot and a button shoe One old boot and a button shoe.
FADE OUT: FADE IN EXT. DESERT COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE - ETHAN AND MARTIN RIDING - The search theme is heard again as the two riders, with single pack horse, are heading south through New Mexico. It is hot country.

DAY: The search theme is heard again as the two riders, with single pack horse, are heading south through New Mexico. It is hot country.
DAY: Their faces are sun-tanned, burned dark and dry. Gone are the heavy coats and clothing of their northern days. They do not speak, just ride and there is the same bleak, fanatic, hard look about them both. The music theme segues into something livelier and Mexican as we -
ETHAN: Recognize it?
ETHAN: There couldn't be two like that in all the world.
ETHAN: ( loudly )
MOSE: He is on his feet and advancing to meet them. As he recognizes them a wide, foolish grin splits his face and his mouth opens and closes in words that won't come out. He grabs and shakes Ethan's arm, then Martin's.
ETHAN: Leggo my arm. You look mangier 'n Ain't been too good. No sir, not too good. Gettin' old, Ethan.
MOSE: Ain't been too good. No sir, not too good. Gettin' old, Ethan.
ETHAN: You were born old.
PROPRIETOR: ( all smiles - as they head for the bar ) Bienvenidos, senores. Pulque?. tequila?. mescal?. huiskey?
ETHAN: Lo mismo.
MARTIN: Lo mismo.
PROPRIETOR: ( beaming ) Y' par' el Viejo el vino del pais. tequila tambien!
158A: INT. THE CANTINA - ANGLING PAST MARTIN TOWARD ESTRELLA She is giving him an appraising once-over, then signals the musicians to play. She rests her buttocks against a table and waits, her eyes challenging Martin to make a move. Emilio is watching Estrella and Martin with something akin to bored INT. THE CANTINA - ANGLE AT BAR Ethan has poured a drink for Mose, now one for himself leaving Martin's glass empty.
158B: INT. THE CANTINA - ANGLE AT BAR Ethan has poured a drink for Mose, now one for himself leaving Martin's glass empty.
MOSE: I been helpin' ye, Ethan. I been lookin' all the time. Thanks for nothin'.
MARTIN: ( to Ethan's back ) Thanks for nothin'.
ETHAN: Well, the reward still stands.
MOSE: Don't want no money, Ethan. jus' a place a roof over m' head. a little grub. a bunk to sleep in. an' a rockin' chair by the fire. my own rockin' chair by a fire.
ETHAN: You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair.
MOSE: Swear it, Ethan?. Given word?
ETHAN: ( impatiently ) Told ya, didn't I?
MOSE: ( impressively ) Ethan. I found a man's seen her. knows where little Debbie is!
ETHAN: Who? Where is he. this man?
EMILIO: I am this man, senor. Emilio Gabriel Fernandez y Figueroa. at your .for a price. .Always for a price.
EMILIO: Un otra!
ETHAN: ( tolerantly ) Come on, Don Juan. We're on our
MARTIN: ( thickly ) Lemme alone.
ETHAN: ( taking his arm ) You breeds are all alike two drinks
MARTIN: Take yer hands off'n me. This lady an' me got some things to talk over!
ETHAN: ( a shrug ) Suit yourself. While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here. The Comanch' medicine country ain't far. there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
MARTIN: Never heard of him.
ETHAN: Cicatriz is Mex for Scar. an' he has a white girl in his tepee. Be seein' you.
EMILIO: Buena suerte, Estrella. Hasta la
ESTRELLA: ( softly ) Tu quieres.?
MARTIN: ( a bitter laugh ) Sure. sure. Only not this year.
MOSE: 'Mind Ethan 'bout my rockin' chair!
ETHAN: Medicine country, huh?
EMILIO: ( slight smile ) Medicine so strong they believe the feather of an eagle found here can guard a man against bullets.
MARTIN: ( looking ahead ) If you got one handy, now's the
DAY: They are turning a bend and now, ahead, we see a cordon of Comanches all armed, all quiet, all very menacing as they watch the approaching column. Emilio calls a greeting in Comanche. It gets no answer.
MARTIN: ( gruffly ) What are we waiting for?
EMILIO'S VOICE: Senores! This is Cicatriz!
ETHAN: ( slowly. at last ) Scar. It's plain to see where you got your name.
SCAR: Your name - Big Shoulders. His name - He Who Follows.
ETHAN: You speak pretty good American for a Comanche. Someone teach you?
SCAR: ( in Comanche ) Ah-we pabbo-tie-bo ee-kee-tay? ( Why did you bring the gringos here? )
EMILIO: ( a shrug in Comanche ) Pabbo-tie-bo kim te-moo-er. ( The gringos want to trade. )
ETHAN: That's right. We come to trade. Only not out here. I don't stand talkin' in the wind. Miguel. caballo aca!
EMILIO: ( sharply ) Miguel. caballo aca!
EMILIO: Co-bay tabitz-chat.
ETHAN: ( to Martin ) Stay out here.
MARTIN: Not likely.
SCAR: Pie-kay! ( Clear out! )
EMILIO'S VOICE: His sons are dead. So his wives sit on the honor side of his lodge.
ONES: ( glancing at them ) Are those his wives too?
ETHAN: ( glancing at them ) Are those his wives too?
SCAR: Two sons killed by white men. For each son, I take many scalps. Mayah-kay zee-eh!.
SCAR: ( louder )
SCAR: ( in Comanche ) ( Go! )
ETHAN: ( his voice controlled ) I've seen scalps before.
SCAR: This before?
ETHAN: ( to Emilio ) I came to trade, not to admire his collection. Tell him we're going to pitch camp across the crick. Maybe we can talk trade tomorrow. ( in Comanche ) Ee-sap! Pabbo-tie-bo ee-sap! ( He lies! The gringo lies! )
SCAR: ( in Comanche ) Ee-sap! Pabbo-tie-bo ee-sap! ( He lies! The gringo lies! )
EMILIO: ( placatingly ) Tomorrow manana 'puetze.'
SCAR: Martin and Ethan turn to go. Only then does Debbie look swiftly at them and as swiftly away. Martin can't help but pause, but Ethan prods him toward the tepee flap.
EMILIO: ( urgently ) Walk with dignity! ( after a moment; lips hardly moving ) If you gringo heretics have any prayers, say them.
MARTIN: ( transfigured ) She's alive. Can you believe it, she's alive. alive. An' we found ( fervently ) Please!. I, too, am alive. I wish to stay that way.
EMILIO: ( fervently ) Please!. I, too, am alive. I wish to stay that way.
EMILIO: ( to his men )
AFTERNOON: Emilio is standing near his horse, talking to Ethan and
EMILIO: You understand, senores. It is not that I am cobarde. cowardly.
ETHAN: Don't apologize. You did your job.
EMILIO: He knows you who you are and why you are here. This I did not understand. or I would not. even for gold, senores. have led you
EMILIO: Take it. I do not want blood money. Vaya con Dios!
MARTIN: You figger Scar means to kill us?
ETHAN: He's got to. All these years, runnin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him. Now we caught up. It's him or us.
MARTIN: Why didn't he make his move back I don't know. Somethin' tied his hands. maybe hospitality.
ETHAN: I don't know. Somethin' tied his hands. maybe hospitality.
MARTIN: ( barely breathing the name )
DEBBIE: ( in Comanche ) ( Go away! ) Both men move closer. She takes a frightened step back, as if to run.
MARTIN: Debbie. Don't you remember me? I'm
DEBBIE: ( in Comanche ) ( softly ) We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie. Ethan, get the horses. I'll try to keep her ( harshly ) How? She's even forgot her own Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear No. not now. not ever.
MARTIN: ( softly ) We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie. Ethan, get the horses. I'll try to keep her ( harshly ) How? She's even forgot her own Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear No. not now. not ever.
ETHAN: ( harshly ) How? She's even forgot her own Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear No. not now. not ever.
MARTIN: Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear No. not now. not ever.
DEBBIE: No. not now. not ever.
MARTIN: I don't care what they've done to you. what happened.
DEBBIE: ( angrily ) They have done. nothing. They are my people.
ETHAN: Your people? They murdered your White men killed them - to steal cows! I was. little. I ran away. They find me. take care of me.
DEBBIE: ( reverting to Comanche ) ( furiously ) White men killed them - to steal cows! I was. little. I ran away. They find me. take care of me.
MARTIN: No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you.
DEBBIE: You lie! All white men lie. and Debbie, think back! I'm Martin. remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
MARTIN: Debbie, think back! I'm Martin. remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
DEBBIE: I remember. from always. At first I prayed to you. come and get me. take me home. You didn't come.
MARTIN: I've come now.
DEBBIE: These are my people. Unnt-meah! Go! Go! Please!
ETHAN: ( grimly ) Stand aside, boy.
MARTIN: Ethan NO!
MARTIN: Debbie! WAIT!
ETHAN: ( angrily ) Never mind her! MOVE!
DAY: They swing around giant boulders, up-ended like pancakes. Ethan is lurching almost out of the saddle, barely conscious. Martin spots the cave ahead and drives his mount and Ethan's toward it.
ETHAN: ( angrily ) Go on! Get out of here while you ( pointing to the cave ) Over there!
MARTIN: ( pointing to the cave ) Over there!
ETHAN: They'll be back.
MARTIN: We won't be here. Come on!
OMITTED: INT. THE CAVE - MED. SHOT - ETHAN - HALF-LIGHT Ethan is lying on the hard earth, perhaps cushioned with some boughs. He is half delirious. A small fire is burning. Martin enters carrying the canteens. He looks unsympathetically toward Ethan, then continues to the fire, takes a knife and starts to sterilize it. Ethan gasps, mumbles and then a word comes clear.
ETHAN: Martha. Martha!
MARTIN: I gotta open that leg and let the poison out.
ETHAN: He fumbles in his shirt pocket, brings out a greasy folded piece of paper.
ETHAN: Just in case. Read it.
MARTIN: 'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley.' I don't want your property.. 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin.
ETHAN: Not no more.
MARTIN: ( angrily ) You can keep your will! ( he thrusts it back into Ethan's shirt ) I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself. What kind o' man are you, anyway.
ETHAN: ( sitting up eyes blazing ) She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a.
MARTIN: ( a shout ) Shut your dirty mouth!
MARTIN: ( slowly ) I hope you die!
FADE OUT: FADE IN INT. JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT - NIGHT A party is in progress. Fiddler and banjo-player are playing a lively square dance for one or two sets of dancers ranchers, their wives and daughters. Laurie is not in evidence. At the far end of the room is a table with a punch bowl set up and a cluster of men and women about. Jorgensen is at the door boisterously welcoming some new arrivals. Leading them into the room is Captain the Reverend Sam Clayton, with a bulky oil-skin package under his arm. With him is Charlie MacCorry, dressed in his best black suit and scrubbed until he looks raw. Behind them come three or four other competent-looking men Rangers all of them.

MRS. JORGENSEN: Why, Charlie, you look real handsome!
CHARLIE: ( grinning ) Yes'm. scarcely reck'nize myself. Where's Laurie? You'll see her soon enough.
MRS. JORGENSEN: You'll see her soon enough.
CLAYTON: ( nodding to the music ) Say, that music sounds so good it must be sinful.
MRS. JORGENSEN: Grab a partner, reverend!
CLAYTON: Well, now, a man of my age just can't haul off and dance in cold blood. but if there's any of that wild cherry brandy of yours, Lars.
JORGENSEN: ( suddenly sober ) ( change of heart ) Yah, by golly. One jug left. I get it!
MRS. JORGENSEN: Last winter that man swore up and down there wasn't a drop left and me with pneumoney!. Reverend, you'd better start clergyin' again!

JORGENSEN: The Rangers are here!
ETHAN: What's that got to do with us?

ETHAN: ( to all ) Evenin'. evenin' Reverend. or do I call you 'Captain'.?
CLAYTON: Came here for a wedding, Ethan. Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do.
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( coming forward ) And news of our little girl, Ethan?
ETHAN: She's not a little girl any more.
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( eyes wide ) You've seen her!. She's alive?
ETHAN: I've seen her. and she's alive.
LAURIE: ( quietly ) Hello, Martie.. I. I wrote you a letter. Reckon you didn't get it.
MARTIN: I. I wrote you a letter. Reckon you didn't get it.
LAURIE: ( setting the lamp down ) One letter in five years. I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out.
MARTIN: It wasn't much of a letter.
LAURIE: No, it wasn't. You mighta said you loved me. You mighta asked me to wait. At least that'd have been But I allus loved you. You know that, without my sayin' it. I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait. the little I had. not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie.
MARTIN: But I allus loved you. You know that, without my sayin' it. I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait. the little I had. not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie.
LAURIE: ( breaking ) It isn't fair.
LAURIE: ( sobbing ) It isn't fair, Martin Pauley, and you know it!
MARTIN: Don't cry, Laurie. I understand how it is. I'll just go 'way.
LAURIE: ( spinning on him ) You do and I'll die, Martie. I will! I'll just die!
CHARLIE: I'll thank you to leave the room,
MARTIN: ( incredulous ) Charlie MacCorry!. You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
CHARLIE: She sure is!. An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
MARTIN: As to that, I don't know, Charlie. We hadn't got around to talkin' What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman.
CHARLIE: What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman.
MARTIN: ( angrily ) If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge.
CHARLIE: AND other things. Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took. I bet she wasn't the first squaw you.
LAURIE: Stop it! Both of you. I won't have any fighting in this house.
MARTIN: It's all right. Charlie, let's move outside.
CHARLIE: I ain't wearing no gun.
CLAYTON: ( yelling ) Sergeant MacCorry!
CLAYTON: Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
CHARLIE: ( regaining his balance ) No sir. pleasure.
CLAYTON: In that case, give the boys room.
CLAYTON: Fight fair, son. Use your fists!
ETHAN: ( drily ) Comanches don't use their fists, reverend. Let 'em alone.
MARTIN: Could scalp him. but I'll just count coup!
CLAYTON: You all right, sergeant?
CHARLIE: Dunno. Seems so.
CLAYTON: Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'. Ain't goin' to be any weddin' not till we get a few things cleared up 'round here.
CHARLIE: Ain't goin' to be any weddin' not till we get a few things cleared up 'round here.
NESBY: ( a grin ) Well. it was a nice weddin' party. considerin' no one got married. Good night, Ed.
JORGENSEN: Good night, Ed.
JORGENSEN: Now, mamma!.
CLAYTON: I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
ETHAN: This an invite to a necktie party, Captain. Nope, wouldn't say that. Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman. Probably needed killin'. I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend. Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.

CHARLIE: You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'.
CLAYTON: Now, now. let's not grow
CLAYTON: ( turning ) What's that? More company?
CLAYTON: Kinda late getting here, aren't they?
LIEUTENANT'S VOICE: Hello there! Captain Clayton?
LIEUTENANT: Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
CLAYTON: I'm Clayton.
LIEUTENANT: ( doubtfully ) You're Captain Clayton?.
LIEUTENANT: ( recovering, he salutes ) Colonel Greenhill's compliments,
CLAYTON: Hold on, son. Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
LIEUTENANT: Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir. Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry. I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
CLAYTON: Oh. Now what's this your pa wants to know?
LIEUTENANT: My pa wants to know. Colonel Greenhill wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
CLAYTON: JOINT action?
LIEUTENANT: Yes sir. We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar.
ETHAN: What information?
LIEUTENANT: That maybe he's not far from here holed up somewhere, waiting his chance to get back over the border. He raided north about a month ago. ran into more army than he bargained for. Now he's running for cover, for keeps this time.
CLAYTON: And what makes you think he's in this territory?
LIEUTENANT: Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago. He talks crazy but I brought him along. Says he lives here. keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
ETHAN: ( half to himself )
ETHAN: MOSE'S VOICE
MOSE!: MOSE'S VOICE
MOSE'S VOICE: Ay-he?. Ay-eh?.
MOSE: Come f'r my rockin' chai'. ole Where's Scar, Mose. SCAR?
ETHAN: ( shouting it ) Where's Scar, Mose. SCAR?
MARTIN: Ask him about Debbie!. Is she all right, Mose?
MOSE: My rockin' chai'.
MRS. JORGENSEN: ( bustling over ) Leave the poor man be! Can't you see he's out of his mind.
ETHAN: Mose. try to remember!. You were in Scar's camp.
MOSE: Ay-he. Made out I was crazy. Ate dirt. chewed grass. I fooled 'em, Ethan!. an' I got away.
ETHAN: Scar! Where's he holed in?
MOSE: Seven Fingers. ay-he. Seven.
MRS. JORGENSEN: Now that's enough! Here. by the fire. What you need's a good bowl of soup. Seven Fingers?
ETHAN: ( blankly ) Seven Fingers?
LIEUTENANT: That's what he told us. but there's no such place on the maps.
MARTIN: Wait a minute! Isn't that the Caddo name for where all those canyons branch on the Malapai?
MOSE: ( from his rocker ) Caddo or Kiowa. ay-he. ay-eh.
CLAYTON: You tell your pa a company of Rangers all fourteen of 'em fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight. headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good.
LIEUTENANT: But. but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow. for your own protection.
CLAYTON: Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive. You want to protect us, you just get out of our way. Now skedaddle!
CLAYTON: Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts without pay. Charlie, hightail it to headquarters an' spread the word.
CHARLIE: Yes sir.
MARTIN: My guns.
LAURIE: Martie. don't go! Not this time.
MARTIN: ( staring ) You crazy?
LAURIE: It's too late. She's a woman grown I got to fetch her home.
MARTIN: I got to fetch her home.
LAURIE: Fetch what home?. The leavin's of Comanche bucks sold time an' again to the highest bidder?. With savage brats of her own, most like?.
MARTIN: ( shouting it ) Laurie! Shut your mouth!
LAURIE: Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?. He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
MARTIN: Only if I'm dead!
CLAYTON: You ready?
MARTIN: ( eyes never leaving Ethan's face ) I'm ready.
ETHAN: We can get within 500 yards. there's a hogback to the south.
CLAYTON: How many, would you say?
ETHAN: ( drily ) Enough to go around. I'd say about a dozen apiece. Mount 'em up!
MARTIN: Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her. and you know it.
ETHAN: ( calmly ) It's what I'm countin' on.
MARTIN: I know you are. Only it ain't goin' to be that way. she's alive.
ETHAN: Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' She's alive. Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out.
MARTIN: ( same tone ) She's alive. Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out.
CLAYTON: Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
ETHAN: There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'. I wasn't going to speak of it. But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?
MARTIN: I saw it. And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's.
ETHAN: You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
ETHAN: I didn't want to tell you. but maybe it's your right to know.
CLAYTON: ( quietly ) Now mount up, son.
MARTIN: It don't change it. All I'm askin' is a chance to sneak in there. an' try to get her out before you come chargin' in.
CLAYTON: What if you're caught?
MARTIN: It won't tell 'em anything, will it! Just a man alone.
ETHAN: I say NO!
CLAYTON: Go ahead, son. But at the first alarm, we're comin' in and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do.
ETHAN: It's your funeral.
CHARLIE: Here. you fight like a Comanch. Maybe this'll help ya pass as one.
CLAYTON: What in.?
GREENHILL: ( calling still distant ) Captain Clayton. Captain! ( exploding ) Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at ( blankly ) Never mind. Your pa know you're out here?
CLAYTON: ( exploding ) Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at ( blankly ) Never mind. Your pa know you're out here?
GREENHILL: ( blankly ) Never mind. Your pa know you're out here?
CLAYTON: Never mind. Your pa know you're out here?
GREENHILL: Yes, sir. Troop's about ten miles back. The Colonel sent me looking for you.
CLAYTON: ( dismissing him ) Well you found me. Good work, son. Good work.
GREENHILL: If there's anything I can do, sir.
CLAYTON: ( under his breath ) God forbid. No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at. and where he's at.
GREENHILL: But he knows THAT, sir. Can't I stay, sir?
CLAYTON: ( reluctantly ) All right. But keep your eye on me, boy. I'm the hard case you're up against here not these childish savages. If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind. I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand.
GREENHILL: Yes, sir.
CLAYTON: Watch that knife, boy!
COMANCHE: ( A rabbit. )
MARTIN: He is staring at it remembering it from certain distinct decorations. The lower part of the tepee is rolled up, for better air circulation. Martin wraps Charlie's blanket around him and begins walking to the tepee.
RANGERS: The line is drawn up, dismounted, the men checking their sidearms, tightening cinches, etc. Sam moves briskly along the line of men, then mounts his horse.
CLAYTON: The State of Texas is payin' you boys $12 a month. Here's your chance to earn it. Now I don't want any foolin' around after scalps. We ain't got the time. Yankee cavalry's on its way here to set those Comanches free. We gotta beat 'em to it our way. Now mount an' guide center on young Greenhill here. Son, you just follow me. And WATCH THAT
KNIFE!: The last comes as Greenhill tries to mount, simultaneously flailing out his sabre perilously close to Clayton.
MARTIN: ( a hoarse whisper ) Debbie. don't!
MARTIN: ( grimly ) I'm takin' you whether you want to or not.
DEBBIE: ( a scream )
MARTIN!: INT. TEPEE - SHOOTING FROM EXTREME LOW ANGLE, AS FROM HER P.O.V. - SCAR He looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the grave when he first kidnapped her. He has a scalping knife in his hand. Scar whips his arm back. Behind him we see the other Comanche the one from the horse herd.
CLAYTON: For these Thy gifts which we are about to receive. Sound that horn, son, and Leave Us Go Amongst Them.YA-HEE!
MARTIN: No, Ethan! NO!
ETHAN: ( quietly ) I'm sorry, girl. Shut your eyes.
ETHAN: ( softly ) You sure favor your mother.
COLONEL: Clayton, if you were in my command I'd have you courtmartialed for this!
CLAYTON: ( angrily, to MacCorry ) Hurry it up!
COLONEL: What's the matter, sir. You wounded? What is it, Sergeant a bullet or an arrow?
AFTERNOON: He is in a rocker on the porch. Suddenly he stares out and stops rocking. Faint in the distance, but coming closer, the clop-clop of two horses, moving at a walk. A moment later Jorgensen emerges and comes to stand beside Mose, shading his eyes and squinting against the sun, still not recognizing the distant horsemen. He is joined by Mrs. Jorgensen. And then Laurie comes out and she too stares, frowning at first, then with dawning realization. Lars and Mrs. Jorgensen also begin to guess. to suspect. and then to know. And Laurie starts to run.
