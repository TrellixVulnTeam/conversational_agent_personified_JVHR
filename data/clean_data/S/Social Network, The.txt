FADE IN: INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of any physically intimidating attributes masks a very complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you or to himself. ERICA, also 19, is Mark's date. She has a girl-next-door face that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there and her politeness is about to be tested. The scene is stark and simple.
MARK: How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's?
ERICA: I didn't know they take SAT's in China.
MARK: I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about here.
ERICA: You got 1600?
MARK: You can sing in an a Capella group.
BRICA: Does that mean that you actually got nothing wrong?
MARK: Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar
ERICA: Or you get into a final club.
MARK: Or you get into a final club, exactly.
ERICA: I like guys who row crew.
MARK: ( BEAT )
ERICA: Have you ever tried?
MARK: I'm trying now.
ERICA: To row crew?
MARK: To get into a final club. To row crew? No. Are you, likewhatevercrazy?
ERICA: Sometimes, Mark-seriously-YOU say two things at once and I'm not sure which one we're talking about.
MARK: But you've seen guys who row crew, right?
ERICA: Okay, well.. they're bigger than me. They're world class athletes. And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you'd met one.
MARK: Okay, well.. they're bigger than me. They're world class athletes. And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you'd met one.
ERICA: I guess I meant I liked the idea of it. The way a girl likes cowboys.
MARK: The Phoenix is good.
ERICA: This is a new topic?
MARK: It's the same topic.
ERICA: We're still talking about the finals Would you rather talk about something It's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs I think I may have had a birthday.
MARK: Would you rather talk about something It's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs I think I may have had a birthday.
ERICA: It's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs I think I may have had a birthday.
MARK: We can change the subject.
MARK: It's about exclusivity.
T'RICA: ...what is?
MARK: The final clubs. And that's how you distinguish yourself. The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc.
ERICA: Which one?
MARK: The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best.
ERICA: I actually meant which Roosevelt.
MARK: Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into? MARK takes a cigarette from a pack, lights it, takes a drag and blows the smoke out before he says.
ERICA: Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into? MARK takes a cigarette from a pack, lights it, takes a drag and blows the smoke out before he says.
MARK: why would you ask me that?
ERICA: why would you ask me that?
MARK: why would you ask me that?
ERICA: I was just asking.
MARK: They're all hard to get into. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil futures last summer and he won't get in. Money or the ability to make it doesn't impress anybody around here. Everybody can do that.
ERICA: He made $300,000 in a summer?
MARK: He likes meteorology.
ERICA: You said it was oil futures.
MARK: If you can predict the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. You asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance,
ERICA: ( BEAT )
MARK: You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that's where I have the best chance.
ERICA: The one that's easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best I just think you askedthe placement of where you asked the question
MARK: I just think you askedthe placement of where you asked the question
ERICA: I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was asking just to ask. Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
MARK: You're obsessed with the finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about this who'll prescribe some sort of medication. You don't care if side effects may include blindness, okay, just do it.
ERICA: You're obsessed with the finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about this who'll prescribe some sort of medication. You don't care if side effects may include blindness, okay, just do it.
MARK: Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.
ERICA: Yes there is.
MARK: Well you dothat was crypticso you do speak in code.
ERICA: I didn't mean to be cryptic.
MARK: I'm saving I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.
ERICA: Because they're exclusive.
MARK: Because they're exclusive.
ERICA: You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club?
MARK: He was a member of the Porcellian and yes I do.
ERICA: Maybe he sang in an a Capella group.
MARK: I want to be straight forward and tell you that I think you should be a lot more supportive. If I get in I'll be taking you to the parties and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to You would do that for me?
ERICA: ( SMILES )
MARK: You're my girlfriend.
ERICA: okay, well I want to be straight forward and tell you that I'm not anymore.
MARK: ( BEAT )
ERICA: I'm not your girlfriend anymore,
MARK: Is this a joke?
ERICA: No, I'm sorry, it's not.
MARK: You're breaking up with me?
ERICA: You're going to introduce me to people I wouldn't normally get to meet? What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
MARK: Take it easy.
ERICA: What was it supposed to mean?
MARK: It wasErica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with the door guy.

MARK: I'm sorry and I mean it..
ERICA: I appreciate that but
MARK: Come on.
ERICA: -I have to study.
MARK: You don't have to study. Let's just talk.
ERICA: I can't..
MARK: Because it's exhausting. Going out with you is like dating a stairmaster.
ERICA: Because it's exhausting. Going out with you is like dating a stairmaster.
MARK: All I meant is that you go to B.U. and so you're not likely toI wasn't making a comment on your parentsI was saying you go to B.U.
ERICA: I have to go study.
MARK: You don't have to study.
ERICA: How do you know I don't have to study?!
MARK: Because you go to B.U.! ERICA stares at him.
ERICA: I'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my education.
MARK: And I'm sorry T don't have a rowboat.
ERICA: I think we should just be friends.
MARK: I don't need friends.
ERICA OF: I was being polite, I had no intention being friends with you.
MARK: You're really leaving. ERICA takes MARK's hand and looks at him tenderly..

EDUARDO: Yes. He said they'd asked him to work on their site but that he'd looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time. Uhh, he said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys.
GAGE: "These guys" meaning my clients.
EDUARDO: Yes. He resentedMark resented that they- that your clients, probably thought he would jump at the chance to rehabilitate his image after the Facemash thing but Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything. With Facemash he'd beaten the Harvard computers, he'd beaten the Ad Board and he made the girls mad. Facemash did what he wanted it to do. MARK kind of nods a little to himself. It should be noted that these depositions have an extra element of dish ort as everything is being said within a few feet of the peop" being talked about.

CAMERON: I'm sorry, I thought you were reading the I've read the letter.
SUMMERS: I've read the letter.

CAMERON: Yes sir, and the R.A. made a recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad Board won't hear us.
SUMMERS: Have you tried dealing with Mr. Zuck.e.rberg directly?
CAMERON: Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't responded to any of our e-mails or phone calls for. the last' two weeks. He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland and the closest we've come to talking face to face is when I saw him on. the quad and chased him through Harvard Square.
SUMMERS: You chased him?
CAMERON: ( BEAT )
SUMMERS: You know he could have you arrested for harassment and attempted assault.
TYLER: ( QUIETLY )
SUMMERS: I don't see this as a University issue.

SUMMERS: You entered into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other.
TYLER: ( BEAT )
SUMMERS: I'm devastated by that.

CAMERON: You might be letting your imagination run away with you.
SUMMERS: You might be letting your imagination run away with you.
TYLER: With all due respect I don't think you're in any position to make that call.
SUMMERS: I was U.S. Treasury Secretary, I'm in some position to make that call.
TYLER: Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshmen address.
SUMMERS: Well. I would try letting your- imaginations run away with you on a new You would.
TYLER: You would.
SUMMERS: Everyone at Harvard is inventing something or starting a new business in their dorm room- Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than getting one so can I suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project?
CAMERON: I'm sorry, but that-'s not the point, sir.
SUMMERS: What's the point?
CAMERON: You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand-the, difference between right and wrong.
SUMMERS: And you're saying that I don't?
CAMERON: Of course I'm not saying that.
TYLER: I'm saying that. SUMMERS looks at TYLER and then smiles.
SUMMERS: Yes. And if you have a goddam problem with that, Mr. Winklevoss, the courts are always at your disposal. Athletes don't get special treatment at this school.
TYLER: Do they get fairness?
SUMMERS: They don't get to run to daddy. Okay? This isn't 50 years ago.

I also have a program running that has a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all five computersthe last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot. Plus every three minutes they all have to drink a shot.
