GRAHAM: ( into phone ) I know he's a fine boy. No one's saying otherwise.
GRAHAM: ( into phone ) Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it was him. You could just talk to him and that would be enough for me. See it was kind of strange finding the crops like that. The kids were. confused by it. It would take the strangeness away if we knew it was Lionel and the Wolfington brothers just messing ( beat, listens ) The movies. ( beat ) Are you sure?

OFFICER PASKI: Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as she put it, "diving for her life" when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards. She went down to Thorton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards. Spitting! By the time I got there, Mrs. Kindleman had sprayed the whole damn place. She must have had a cold or something. It was enough to turn a grown man's stomach.
OFFICER PASKI: So what happened to your crops?
BO: I think it's contaminated.
MORGAN: You don't even know what that word
MORGAN: It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.

OFFICER PASKI: Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.

BO: Houdini's sick.
GRAHAM: Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's
GRAHAM: They're tough cookies, those two. They think Houdini's playing with you up there. At least it got them to sleep.
GRAHAM: Okay Miss Puzzle Master. I got one for you. What can make geometric shapes the size of a football field. and what would scare every animal in this county? Have you figured it out yet? You probably have. Give me a hint Colleen. Is it bigger than a bread box?
GRAHAM: What's the matter?
BO: I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water? What's wrong with the water next to your bed?

There are two glasses of water on Bo's bedside table. Graham moves to Bo's bed. He sits on the edge of it. She stares back at him as she holds her panda.

GRAHAM: This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
MERRILL: ( whispering ) We both go outside and move around the house in opposite directions. We act crazy, insane with anger. Make him crap in his pants and force him around till we meet up on the other side.
GRAHAM: ( whispering ) Explain, act crazy?
MERRILL: ( whispering ) Curse and stuff.

GRAHAM: I cursed.
MERRILL: I heard.
GRAHAM: He's on the roof.
OFFICER PASKI: You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
GRAHAM: It does seem kind of odd doesn't I don't know whether to look for a midget or a
OFFICER PASKI: I don't know whether to look for a midget or a
GRAHAM: He definitely wasn't a midget.
OFFICER PASKI: ( beat ) So he was tall?
GRAHAM: ( to Merrill ) I would say so.
MERRILL: OFFICER PASKI
OFFICER PASKI: Over six feet? It was very dark.
MERRILL: It was very dark.
GRAHAM: Yes, it was.
OFFICER PASKI: We've established that. Just tell me about his clothing
OFFICER PASKI: Was he wearing a Scottish kilt or
OFFICER PASKI: Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible. Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
GRAHAM: Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement. But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar. I need you to take this seriously, just incase, it is something
OFFICER PASKI: I apologize. Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
MORGAN: Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
GRAHAM: It needs batteries.
MORGAN: It needs batteries.
GRAHAM: Edgar, come inside.
OFFICER PASKI: How certain are you, that this was a male?
MERRILL: I don't know any girls can run like
MORGAN: These are D's; I need double A's.
GRAHAM: I have some upstairs.
OFFICER PASKI: I don't know Merrill. I've seen some of those women on the Olympics. They could out run me
MERRILL: This guy got on the roof in like a Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
GRAHAM: Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
MERRILL: That roof is over ten feet high.
GRAHAM: He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
OFFICER PASKI: They got women's high jumping in the Olympics. They got these Scandinavian women who could jump clean over me.
GRAHAM: Shoot, it needs a screw driver. I have double A's in here. I know you're making a point Edgar. I just don't know what it is.
GRAHAM: I know you're making a point Edgar. I just don't know what it is.
OFFICER PASKI: Yesterday afternoon, an out of town woman stopped by the diner and started yelling and cussing cause they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine. Scared a couple of customers. No one's seen her since. My point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw. We should just keep all possibilities available.
BO: Dad, where's the remote?
GRAHAM: Bo, you're too old to still be doing this. The rule is, you take a glass of water, you finish it. Now what's wrong with this one?
BO: There's dust in it.
GRAHAM: This one?
BO: A hair.
GRAHAM: This one?
BO: Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
MERRILL: Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else is a I'm not done asking questions and I don't appreciate the sarcasm.
OFFICER PASKI: I'm not done asking questions and I don't appreciate the sarcasm.
OFFICER PASKI: Do you have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you? Maybe a church member, who might not have liked the fact, that you left the church?
GRAHAM: I don't think so.
OFFICER PASKI: Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need
GRAHAM: Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts replacing the batteries.
MERRILL: Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts replacing the batteries.
OFFICER PASKI: Is anything missing?
GRAHAM: Graham hands Morgan the monitor. He turns it ON. THERE IS A
MORGAN: It's still making the noises. It's It's old Morgan.
GRAHAM: It's old Morgan.
MERRILL: Listen, I was out of line with that whole female Scandinavian Olympian
MERRILL: It's just that, I'm pretty strong and pretty fast. And I was running as fast as I could. And this He was just toying with us.
OFFICER PASKI: Could everyone just take a seat on the couch. I have some preliminary
OFFICER PASKI: There are three possibilities here. We'll call them one, two and three. The level one scenario is that there is a sane individual, who for real reasons wants to do you harm. I really don't believe that's what we're looking at here. In my opinion, whoever this is, they don't want to do harm to you all. That's kind of clear. The level two scenario is, this is a mentally unstable person who's fixated on you and your family. This is a possibility, but a very slim one. I assure you I will treat all three possibilities carefully, but in all likely hood we are looking at what we'll call a level three scenario. He's a watcher. Someone who this is a game for. He's laying low. Doesn't want to be seen. But he wants to watch you. Study you
OFFICER PASKI: Now I don't want you all to worry about this no more. You're making more of this than it is. You guys have had a tough couple of days with the vandalism to the crops and the death of your Maybe you guys should do something fun? Let me worry about this person. Let me find out who it is and then What the hell are you people looking at?
OFFICER PASKI: I'll be damned.
GRAHAM: Turn up the volume Bo.
BO: I can't find the remote.
TV ANCHOR: images were shot yesterday afternoon by a thirty-four year old local camera man in Kerala, a southern city of India. It is the eighteenth reported crop circle found in that country in the last seventy-two hours.
MORGAN: ( wonder ) What in God's name is going on?
OFFICER PASKI: What in God's name is going on?
OFFICER PASKI: Don't ask me what I think. Cause I can't think straight right now. I'm going back to the station. Have a cup of Marcia's coffee and try to think clear. After that I might make some calls. Hoaxes. People got way too much time on their hands.
OFFICER PASKI: But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days. Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
GRAHAM: Six months.
GRAHAM: And three weeks.
OFFICER PASKI: It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
GRAHAM: It's good advice. Say hi to Marcia for me.
OFFICER PASKI: You take care of yourself.

CREWCUT GUY: I got it figured.
MERRILL: You do?
CREWCUT GUY: I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows covert like. No one's got hurt mind you. And that's the give away.
MERRILL: ( doesn't see ) I see.
CREWCUT GUY: It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all Clear for what?
MERRILL: Clear for what?
CREWCUT GUY: . For the rest of them.
MERRILL: You have a pamphlet or something I can read?
CREWCUT GUY: Hey you didn't used to play baseball did you?

MERRILL: Five. The five longest.
CREWCUT GUY: Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
MERRILL: Hello Lionel.
LIONEL: He'd just swing as hard as he could every time. It didn't matter what the coach said, didn't matter who was on base, he'd whip that bat through the air as hard as he could. Looked like a lumber jack chopping down a tree. Merrill here, struck out more times than any two players. You really hold the strike out
CREWCUT GUY: You really hold the strike out
MERRILL: Felt wrong not to swing.
PHARMACIST: I cursed thirty-seven times last week. I said the f-word a couple times, but mostly "shits" and Is "Douche bag" a curse? I suppose it's in its usage.
GRAHAM: I suppose it's in its usage.
PHARMACIST: How about "John you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara?"
GRAHAM: That's a curse.
PHARMACIST: Then it's not thirty-seven. It's
PHARMACIST: I stole a bottle of Ruby red lip stick from K-mart. I punched my brother in the back three times.
BO: It's contaminated.
MRS. NATHAN: Carl, there's something wrong with our water!

MRS. NATHAN: ( fascinated ) Is that right?
MORGAN: I'll take it.
MERRILL: Pharmacy crowded?
GRAHAM: I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
MORGAN: ( soft ) Is that him?
MERRILL: ( soft )
BO: Who is he?

GRAHAM: It's just static Morgan. Turn it up and see.
MORGAN: It's a code.
GRAHAM: Let me see that please.
MERRILL: It's noise.
GRAHAM: It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this. Let's get out of the car okay?
MORGAN: We might lose the signal.
GRAHAM: We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
MERRILL: We'll look like mental patients.
GRAHAM: I'm getting out now.
MORGAN: Don't do it.
OUTSIDE CAR: Graham stands and closes his driver side door.
MORGAN: Nobody move!
MORGAN: Voices. Did you hear that?
MORGAN: Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
BO: I heard them Morgan.
GRAHAM: It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
MERRILL: That's right.
MERRILL: Let me see it.
MORGAN: Graham and Merrill freeze both touching the monitor over the roof of the station wagon.
MORGAN: It doesn't sound like words.
GRAHAM: See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get I'm letting go now.
BO: No dad!
MORGAN: Don't do it!
MERRILL: You'll lose the signal!
MORGAN: Don't let go.
GRAHAM: It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
MORGAN: It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
GRAHAM: Morgan, be careful.
MERRILL: I got him.
GRAHAM: Hold on. Merrill you got her.
GRAHAM: Merrill you got her.
MORGAN: Everyone STOPS exactly where they are. Graham holds Bo over his head. Bo reaches out to Merrill. Merrill sits on the roof with one arm out. Morgan stands with the baby monitor raised high in the air. The Hess family remains very still on the hood of their station wagon as they listen.
MORGAN: ( soft ) There's two of them talking.
MORGAN: ( soft ) They hung up.
GRAHAM: You know something? Even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been
GRAHAM: I can see how people can get carried away with this type of
GRAHAM: It's a kind of faith. It's an intoxicating thing to believe in something you can't see.
GRAHAM: You were always good at that. Believing in things you couldn't You would have been the first person on that station wagon wouldn't you? You and Morgan would have been wrestling for that baby
GRAHAM: Believing in things you couldn't You would have been the first person on that station wagon wouldn't you? You and Morgan would have been wrestling for that baby
GRAHAM: It'll be secretly kind of sad for everybody, when this turns out to be all just make believe.
GRAHAM: ( yelling ) You're wasting your time here! I'm not going to report this or anything you do to me crops, to the news or TV or anybody! You're not going to get famous!
GRAHAM: ( soft ) ( beat ) Let's turn on the TV.
TV REPORTER: first appeared fifty two minutes
BO: Morgan, Merrill and Graham stand silently before the television set.
TV ANCHOR: Mexico City officials as well as U.S. officials have confirmed that these are not air crafts from either government's airforce. The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space. They were not detected by radar by either country. The crazies were right.
MERRILL: The crazies were right.
MORGAN: We have to tape this.
BO: My ballet recital.
MORGAN: ( gravely serious ) Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there. ( beat ) For your children Bo.
BO: My ballet recital.
MORGAN: Graham doesn't take his eyes off the screen.
GRAHAM: ( preoccupied ) Find another tape.
MORGAN: Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.
TV ANCHOR: . You're seeing a live feed from our NBC affiliate down in Mexico City. The time there is 7:17pm. This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way. What you're seeing is real. Everything they wrote in science books is about to change. Told you.
MORGAN: ( soft ) Told you.
MERRILL: ( whispers ) Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
GRAHAM: ( whispers ) That's true.
MERRILL: ( whispers ) Do you think it's a possibility?
GRAHAM: ( whispers ) ( whispers ) How can you say that?
MERRILL: ( whispers ) How can you say that?
GRAHAM: ( whispers ) That wasn't the answer you wanted?
MERRILL: ( whispers ) Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some
GRAHAM: ( whispers ) . There are all different ways you can tell that there's someone really there watching out for us. You see signs. Sometimes they're little ones. You think of someone. The phone rings. They're on the phone. Sometimes they're big, like fourteen lights hovering over Mexico City. ( beat ) Sure, there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing. But there are a lot of people watching this, who think it's a miracle. A sign of God's existence. It's all in how you look at things Merrill. ( beat ) What you have to decide is what kind of person you are? Are you the type who believes in miracles and looks for signs or are you the kind who believes, things just happen by chance?
MERRILL: I was at this party once. I'm on a couch with Sara Mckinney. She was just sitting there, looking beautiful and staring at me. I go to lean in and kiss her and I realize I have gum in my mouth. I turn and take out the gum. Stuff it in my paper cup next to the sofa and turn around. Sara Mckinney throws up all over herself. I knew the second it happened. It was a miracle. I could have been kissing her when she threw up. That would have scarred me for life. I may never have recovered.
MERRILL: I'm a miracle man. Those lights are a miracle.
GRAHAM: ( whispers ) There you go. ( whispers ) So which type are you? ( whispers ) Do you feel comforted?
MERRILL: ( whispers ) So which type are you? ( whispers ) Do you feel comforted?
GRAHAM: ( whispers ) Do you feel comforted?
MERRILL: ( whispers ) ( whispers ) What does it matter then?
GRAHAM: ( whispers ) What does it matter then?
GRAHAM: ( whispers ) Do you know what Colleen's last words were before they killed her?
GRAHAM: ( whispers ) She said, "See", and then her eyes glazed a bit and she said. "Tell Merrill to swing away."
GRAHAM: ( whispers ) Do you know why she said that?
GRAHAM: ( whispers ) Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her ( beat ) There is no one watching out for us Merrill. We're all on our own.
MERRILL: For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something What's furry, furry rabbit?
GRAHAM: What's furry, furry rabbit?
MERRILL: ( points ) That's a game isn't it? ( beat ) ( points at the TV ) There's been some interesting What time is it?
GRAHAM: What time is it?
MERRILL: Eleven a.m. They're gone.
MERRILL: But they're not really gone. We just can't see them. Early this morning a bird flew right at the area where the lights were hovering last night.
MERRILL: It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
MERRILL: They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky. They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit They're still there hovering. In fact, some people think there's more of them now. All over the place. Over us even. And there's a theory about the crop circles now. They think it could be some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they can navigate. Coordinate. Makes sense doesn't it?

MORGAN: So the aliens can't read our minds.
GRAHAM: They tell you everything in this
MORGAN: They tell you everything in this
MORGAN: It says they're probably very small like my height because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
GRAHAM: Who wrote this book? Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
MORGAN: Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
GRAHAM: That means they're unemployed.
MORGAN: Dad, are you going to be serious?
BO: Yeah, serious.
GRAHAM: I don't know what got into me.
MORGAN: There are pictures.
MORGAN: Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book
GRAHAM: I just asked his name.
MORGAN: I just asked his name.
GRAHAM: I just asked his name.
MERRILL: You had a tone. He says there are two reasons why Extraterrestrials would visit us.
MORGAN: He says there are two reasons why Extraterrestrials would visit us.
MORGAN: To make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe.
MORGAN: Or the other reason. They're hostile. They've used up the resources on their planet and are looking to harvest our planet next.
GRAHAM: Looks a little like our house doesn't it?
BO: The same windows.
MORGAN: ( soft ) That's weird.
GRAHAM: That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for now. Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or
PHONE VOICE: THROUGH THE PHONE WE HEAR SUDDEN SCUFFLING, A CHAIR SQUEAL NOTHING BUT DEAD AIR. Graham looks at the receiver and then slowly hangs it up. Graham walks down the hall to a small window. The window looks down the driveway and out onto the road. Graham stares into the distance. About a half-mile away we see the TIP OF A HOUSE. Graham gazes at it for a beat.

GRAHAM: Hello Ray.
GRAHAM: What happened Ray?
RAY: I wrote your number down to call you. It's been sitting next to the phone for six months. When I knew it was inside the house, I couldn't think of any other number to call. I panicked. Thank you for coming Father.
GRAHAM: ( soft ) You're welcome Ray.
RAY: I worked so long that night. I ain't never fallen asleep driving before. And never since. Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car insight in either direction. If I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended up in a ditch with a head ache. It had to happen at that right moment. That certain ten-fifteen seconds when I passed her walking. It was like it was meant to be.
RAY: I guess if this is the end of the world, I'm screwed right? People who kill Reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in heaven.
GRAHAM: Where you going Ray?

MERRILL: I'm sorry, what book is this?
GRAHAM: Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?

MORGAN: Sounds made up. We can choose to believe it and pack up and leave. Or we can stay here. Board up this house. Hide inside our home and wait it out. Either way, at least we'll be together. All those in favor of the lake, raise your hand.
