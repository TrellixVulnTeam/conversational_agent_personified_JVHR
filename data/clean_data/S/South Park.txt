PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison ever said- 'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass spelunker' in school!
STAN: Oh, oh.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: Thank you all for coming on such short notice. As you can see, your boys are all being disciplined.
STAN'S MOTHER: This just isn't like you, Stanley!
KYLE'S MOTHER: What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: No, it was worse than that.
KYLE'S MOTHER: ( Gasping ) The F word?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
STAN'S MOTHER: Oh dear God.

CARTMAN'S MOTHER: That's when the fist is inserted into the anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: KYLE'S MOTHER ( To Kyle )
KYLE'S MOTHER: ( To Kyle ) Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: What is Terrance and Phillip?
KYLE'S MOTHER: Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage. Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
CARTMAN: Everybody's already fucking seen it.
MS. CARTMAN: I'm sorry! I can't help it!! That movie has warped my fragile little mind.

KYLE'S MOTHER: We must take action on this immediately.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
KYLE'S MOTHER: Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too. Shall we say. soft? As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: Article 42! You don't mean-?!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Yes Principal Victoria. The PTA is impeaching you.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: But I-
KYLE'S MOTHER: You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Get out of that chair! The PTA is in charge now!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Attention students. We are now enforcing a new dress code at South Park Elementary. Terrance and Phillip shirts are NO LONGER ALLOWED IN SCHOOL. Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is to be SENT HOME IMMEDIATELY.

NEWS ANCHOR: Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or is it Canada?
KYLE'S MOTHER: NEWS ANCHOR
NEWS ANCHOR: Alright. Here with a counterpoint is the Canadian Minister of Movies.
NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you, Minister, for joining us.

KYLE'S MOTHER: YOU JUST DON'T CARE! Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? .The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS?

NURSE: While Doctor Gauche wrestles with Kenny's lungs and torso, the nurse reaches into Kenny's mouth and pulls both his windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth, turning them inside out in the process. Off to the side, Stan, Cartman and Kyle look on as the doctor and nurses tangle themselves in knots with Kenny's innards.
DOCTOR GAUCHE: No! THAT DOESN'T GO THERE!!
NURSE: Watch his liver!!! I'll get it!!!

DOCTOR GAUCHE: We have precious little time left people! We're going to lose him soon!!

DOCTOR GAUCHE: How are you feeling, son?
KENNY: mph.. rmph..
DOCTOR GAUCHE: Great. Son, I have some bad news. We accidentally replaced your heart with a baked potato. You have about seven seconds to live.

CARTMAN: No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
KYLE: The boys walk out, leaving Kenny's corpse behind. We can still hear the boys voices as they exit.
FLASH!!: EXT. SPACE - Kenny's body is floating through a great void. A PEACEFUL SONG plays as he soars upwards to the heavens. note - except for Kenny's little construction paper body, this entire sequence should be done in 3D CGI. Ahead of him, Kenny can see a great white light. It appears warm and inviting. Now Kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down in the heavens. He reaches out to touch them. Kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and bobbing breasts. The music crescendos as Kenny gets almost close enough to the light to touch it. Just then, a huge, electronic sign pops up. 'Access Denied'. Suddenly, Kenny goes spiraling downward. The song changes to a MINISTRY type number as Kenny's surroundings start to become darker and more twisted. Kenny's hapless spirit enters a horrifying red tunnel, filled with flames and heat.
KENNY: Mph rmph rm!
STAN: How can they do this?
KYLE: It isn't fair!
CARTMAN: Well, Terrance and Phillip are on Conan O'Brian tonight, we could at least go watch that.

DOCTOR PANGLOSS: Thank you, parents.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: The machinery of the new 'V-chip' is very simple, and similar to that of the V- chip. The chip is placed just under the subject's skin, where it emits a small but painful shock of electricity whenever an obscenity is uttered.
STAN'S FATHER: Now wait a minute, are you telling us that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid is swearing?
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: It's just like a lie detector. Certain things happen in you when you swear just like when you lie, the chip picks up on this and gives the subject a shock.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: We are very excited to see the results of this test. Patient 453, would you step out here,
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip.
