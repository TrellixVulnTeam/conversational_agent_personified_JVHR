OFFICER: Take your time. Take a good look.
SAFEWAY CASHIER: Ah, a-are you sure they can't see us?
OFFICER: Two-way mirror, ma'am.
FACTORY WORKER: But they're trained killers. A guy at the plant says, "In 'Nam they could smell ya!"
OFFICER: This is the United States of America,
DIANE: ( friendly, to female officer ) I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am, but is this going to take long? It's game ( on intercom ) Picture in three
OFFICER: ( on intercom ) Picture in three
FBI AGENT: .and testifying in such a case is a serious matter. Should you decide your testimony would jeopardize your personal Look, "Sipowitz", I said I'd tell you everything - I was just hoping to finish up before menopause kicks in.
LISA: Look, "Sipowitz", I said I'd tell you everything - I was just hoping to finish up before menopause kicks in.
CLOSE ON: Foggy, heart-shaped mirror.
DIANE: ( to self in mirror ) Morning, sunshine. Remember, these are the best days of your life.
END ON: Diane, pompoms on hips, smiles toward the camera. A SIGN on the floor in front of her reads: "SQUAD MEMBER." A SIGN to her left reads: "CHALLENGER". BRUCE, an effeminate young man, bounds up behind the "CHALLENGER" sign - putting his pompoms on hips.
DIANE: Hey, Bruce! You look cute.
BRUCE: ( off clothes ) Tommy Hilfiger. I'm hoping fourth year's a charm.
LISA: Outta my way, fag. I'm up.
DIANE: Lisa?. Is-is that you?
LISA: ( looks straight ahead ) I lost a little weight.
LISA: Now, the squad as a whole? They're closer than Carolina cousins. Some people say they're, like, lezbos or something. But that's mostly just the yag-offs in band.
CLEO: Dreams? You mean, like, where I'm in Conan's all leather apartment - I don't know if he has one, that's why it's a dream - and suddenly we're buck-naked and all oiled up. I don't know where the oil comes from - again, that's why it's a dream.
KANSAS: Son-of-a-blue-balled-bitch! I always get this one.
FOCUS CLEARS: In silhouette, a MAN is FUCKING a NURSE.
DIANE: Today, we're going to cheer loud, jump high, and look pretty because
DIANE: Now let's get going - because nobody ever got ahead by sitting on their

JACK'S POV: Outside the gym doors.
THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE!: LISA ( V.O. )
ANGLE ON: Mascot/Bruce as he drags his prize quarterback out of the gym. Jack and Diane's eyes never separate.
CLOSE ON: Diane's mouth.
DIANE: Jack Bartlett. Jack Bart-lett. Jack
DIANE: . Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt. Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
HANNAH: ( nervous ) I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board? It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
KANSAS: Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board. Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
HANNAH: ( looking down ) Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
KANSAS: Hold up, hold up. Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
CLEO: That's not true. Those pictures of Christ - all sweaty and bare-chested on the cross - always kinda made me hot.
KANSAS: Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm. And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
DIANE: Well, I want to know what happened
HANNAH: Okay, one night, around sunset, I went horseback riding with the nuns. They went every night. And, well, we're trotting pretty hard, y'know? The hard leather saddle, pounding between my I just got a little squishy.
CLEO: I just got a little squishy.
HANNAH: All of a sudden, I feel. I feel. I feel just super alive. "down there." I swear I thought it was the second coming.
KANSAS: Nope. Sounds more like the first.
DIANE: ( taking the hand-piece ) I'll just ask the question myself. "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
JACK: FOOTBALL PLAYER #2 FOOTBALL PLAYER #1
JACK: Never opened her up.
JACK: Who was the girl who kicked me in the head yesterday?
GEEKY GUY: As the A.V. Club candidate, I think, for the first time in fifty years, we should NO to a football player as king!
JACK: Whoa.Thanks, uh - WOW. Uh, hey, alright.okay, uh
JACK: Guys! Hey, guys! Shut up a minute.
FEMALE VOICES: We love you, Jack!
JACK: Hey, well, I love you lunch ladies!
CLOSE ON: Janitorial Closet Door. An excited Diane and Jack meet in front of it, kiss and roll into the closet.
CLOSE ON: Door. Red-faced Jack and Diane peek out, look to see they're alone, kiss good-bye, then head off in opposite directions. DOOR CLOSES to reveal a sign "Principal Smith."
ON JACK: as he reaches the line of scrimmage. There's ONE DEFENDER LEFT. Jack fakes left, right - takes the tackle - but manages to roll out of it! HE-COULD-GO-ALL-THE.
ON JACK: he looks right - sees Diane and mouths "I love you!"
JACK'S POV: Diane mouths "I love you!"
DIANE'S POV: Jack makes the touchdown, spikes the ball, and starts a slow run toward us - arms outstretched. WE run toward him in SLOW MOTION. SUDDENLY a WALL OF PLAYERS enter frame and tackles him in celebration.
DEEDEE: Well, there's a Christmas card.
DENNIS: Come in, come in.
JACK: I'm on it, Mr. Weston.
DEEDEE: Oh - say, where're my manners. I'm DeeDee - you can remember me because of my double "D's."
DENNIS: And I'm Diane's Dad, Dennis. Do not try that after one of my Screwdrivers!
DEEDEE: ( recovering ) Whoooo - now who wants some pigs-in-a
ANGLE ON: Vanity mirror. Diane is putting on lip gloss - she looks beautiful in her gown. We see JACK ENTER in the b.g. She turns. He reacts to her beauty.
DIANE: Hi, Jack.
JACK: Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
JACK: Hold on a minute. Hold on. I have an
DEEDEE: Oh, oh, mother of the bride - I'm But not before. I have our baby.
DIANE: But not before. I have our baby.
DIANE: . so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
JACK: I don't know. And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
DIANE: Well, if I had to guess. I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own. Jack, do you know what I see here?
JACK: Spit from your dad?
DIANE: ( wiping his hair ) I see a flower. And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
JACK: So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
DIANE: So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
JACK: I sure do.
DIANE: I sure do.
JACK: ( trust and love in his eyes ) Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you right before you kicked me in the head.
DIANE: ( touched ) Oh, Jack.
DIANE: ( in last stall ) No thanks - don't need one.
CLEO: Holy shit.
LUCY: You just became a statistic!
KANSAS: ( suddenly happy ) Oh my G-d! I'm not first!
HANNAH: But you're not married.
CLEO: Wait! Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant. You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
KANSAS: Shut up, Cleo. Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
HANNAH: ( suddenly freaked ) What?! No! Not an abortion! My church can arrange for you to go to Oregon and take care of a "sick aunt" for nine months. Then they put your baby good home and you come back - a little dazed and puffy - but everything's fine! Oh please, Di, don't be a whore and a
JACK: Hey, guys? Uh, I got Diane pregnant.
HANNAH: I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
DIANE: I know, Hannah. Look, I'm not going to get an abortion. I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep. 'Course, that was a long-long time ago. But no matter what, she held her head high and said. "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep. Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby. Hey. I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one.
KANSAS: We're here for you, Diane.
REVERSE ANGLE: Jack and Diane sit in front of an older LOAN OFFICER'S desk. SIGN READS: "Your home for home loans." Loan officer looks over papers as Jack and Diane look excitedly at one another. Diane takes Jack's hand.
LOAN OFFICER: I'm sorry.
DIANE: What?! But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football Let me explain something.
LOAN OFFICER: Let me explain something.
DIANE: No. Wait! Did I say Promise! Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
LOAN OFFICER: Uh, yes. Yes you did.
JACK: Diane. Hold on a minute. I think I know where this is going. I'm willing to put up the papers for my Mustang - she's got a few miles on her, but she looks great.
LOAN OFFICER: I'm sure, son, but
JACK: Okay! Stop twisting my arm! I'll throw in the speakers.
LOAN OFFICER: Look, kids, why don't you just have your parents come i n and get a loan? Then they could give you the money.
DIANE: ( building from a slow burn ) With all due respect, Jack and Diane
LOAN OFFICER: Sorry. My hands are tied.
JACK: ( watching proudly )
CLOSE ON: A smiling Jack and Diane as they look lovingly into each other's eyes.
DIANE: Well. it's a little more than we wanted to spend, but we'll take it!
APARTMENT MANAGER: Fine. Just remember, I manage the building. I don't, like, own it or fix it. So, like, I don't care if shit breaks. All I care is that the rent is shoved under my door on the first. Oh, and if there's, like, packages outside my door? Leave 'em the hell alone.
CUSTOMER POV: Jack, in uniform, stands behind the counter.

JACK: Dinkie is a bad, bad man.
JACK: ( defeated ) Y'know what? I'll save you the time. I'm not going to lie. I don't believe in it. If you pick your ass - I'm going to tell people. I have no idea how to run your registers. And, if any of you are hard core drinkers and like to throw knives, well, I'm outta here right now.

JACK: Yeah - well, after football practice.
CHRIS: ( savoring the words ) Football practice - fantasmic.
TED: You're hired!
JACK: I'm on top of the world!
DIANE: Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
JACK: ( positively giddy ) But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
DIANE: ( putting all three in cart ) If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
JACK: ( putting all three in cart ) If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
DIANE: ( removing the box ) Me too! Will it ever end?! ( yelling to the store ) I love this lady!
JACK: Me too! Will it ever end?! I love this lady!
DIANE: Jack, I think I should get a job.
JACK: ( rubbing her belly ) But we agreed your job is running the baby machine.
DIANE: I know, but that was before.
JACK: Ah! I almost forgot gas for the baby machine. I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
JACK: I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch. Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
DIANE: ( mouth full of Snickers )
MONTAGE BEGINS: INT. SAFEWAY - SEAFOOD DEPARTMENT/BANK BRANCH - DAY CLOSE ON A FISH In the seafood case. The BUTCHER's hand comes in, takes it out, and flops it on the scale.
ANGLE ON: Oscillating fan behind him. Follow the smell as it drifts from the counter over to Diane, working in the Bank Branch. She sniffs, sniffs again, then suddenly gags and goes down behind the counter.
CLOSE ON: Diane's belly. Jack's HAND comes into frame, tracing it against the wall. PULL BACK as DIANE steps away. We SEE TWO LINES labelled, "AUGUST" and "SEPTEMBER" on the wall. They smile and kiss.
SLOW MOTION: The squad, in uniform, walks toward camera in a line across the hall - looking cool as hell.
ANGLE BEHIND: Squad walks away. An ADDITIONAL PIECE OF FABRIC has been added to the back of Diane's skirt.
BUILDING MANAGER: I need a place to keep this. Anyone asks, what d'ya know? You don't know
HECKLER: Hey, Bartlett, pick up your skirt when you run!
KANSAS: ( yelling to heckler ) Run, you bastard, run! She's hormonal!!
CLOSE ON: Diane's belly. Jack's hand comes into frame, tracing it.
PULL BACK: as Diane steps away. We see THREE LINES: "August", "September" and "October" already written on the wall. They smile and kiss.
CLOSE ON: Jack and the social retards.
JACK: .she's in my hands, right? Moist to the touch. It's at that moment I think I control her - she's mine. But it's a false illusion, like in "Backdraft." No man controls fire! She's ready, I'm ready, she's ready, I yell, "One-fifty four, forty eight."
PULL BACK: to reveal he's holding a football.
CLEO: I can't believe they have the "Top Ten Alternatives to Sex for You and Your Boyfriend" and "watching each other masturbate" isn't even listed!
LUCY: ( off pregnancy book ) Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
KANSAS: More proof God's a guy.
LUCY: .and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
KANSAS: Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
ANGLE BEHIND: A larger piece of fabric has been added to the back of Diane's skirt.
CHRIS: Jack, c'mon, you promised.
JACK: ( yawning ) Okay, one question.
TED: ( to other social retards ) Oh, me-me-me, mine's great.
CHRIS: Proceed, Dungeon Master Quan.
TED: Okay. Jack, y'know how you and Diane. slept together? Well now that you can't, y'know, ( fuck ) "sleep together," but you still sleep together, don't you ever get, like, just, super horny? If so, how horny? I'll be quiet now so I can listen to your answer.
LISA: ( flirting her ass off ) Yeah, Jack - I'd love to hear your

CLOSE ON: Diane's belly. Jack's HAND comes into frame, tracing it. ICE CREAM drips on it. Jack licks it off as we PULL BACK to see a VERY TIRED Diane holding a pint of ice cream, using a SNICKERS as a spoon. FOUR lines labelled "August," "September," "October" and "November" on the wall. Jack gives Diane a tired peck on the cheek as she continues to eat.
ON CROWD: As they TURN FLASH CARDS IN UNISON to read: "2-4-6-8 LOGS ARE
ON SQUAD: going nuts! They notice Diane isn't there. She's eating a vendor's box. They run over to her.
ON JACK: running for a touchdown - a la his homecoming run. This time he's exhausted and the competition is gaining. Everything grinds to a SLO-MO CRAWL as Jack makes a heroic leap for the touchdown. With his spare hand, he attempts to smother a huge yawn, as opposing players come flying at him from both sides.
END MUSIC: LISA ( V.O. )
CLOSE ON: Diane's face - smashed against A SIDE GLASS PANEL as she SLEEPS. She really does look like shit - puffy eyes, no make up, dark circles, bad hair and drool coming from her mouth.
DIANE: ( waking up ) ( scratching on window ) Ahh! I'm under the ice! I'm uh ( opening her window ) That was a weird one.
PULL BACK: To REVEAL the squad stands in front of Diane.

LISA: ( loud whisper ) Get your loser ass away from me! Oh my G-d - are you okay?
JACK: ( groggily reaching up )
LUCY: Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!

CLEO: Di, are you okay? We can skip the girl party this week.
DIANE: ( unconvincing ) Everything's fine. I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside
HANNAH: You want us to help you pick up?

KANSAS: And we have our first pregnancy mood swing. All that's left is
LATER: Squad sits in a cleared space in front of the BIG TV, painting nails, reading magazines, etc. Diane eats.
CLEO: Did you guys hear that in China - or one a those places that makes the really cheap silk shoes and kids are super smart - that as a reward for good grades, mothers get their kids hookers to blow 'em?
HANNAH: Huh. Musta been a dream.
CLEO: Huh. Musta been a dream.
DIANE: I'm sorry to keep asking this, but are you guys sure I'm not fat?
KANSAS: Uh, "no". You're not fat.
DIANE: You sure I'm not fat?
LUCY: ( can't take it any more ) Look, you're fat, Diane. You're fat, fat, fat! Because you eat, eat, eat! ( to shocked squad ) What?! She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
DIANE: ( breaking down ) No I don't. I keep asking because I feel fat.
LUCY: Oh G-d, I'm sorry. You're not really fat! I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
DIANE: You sure?
LUCY: "Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm.
DIANE: "Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm.
LUCY: Oh my G-d, I read about this! It's called a "pregnancy insanity." Quick, she needs a sitz bath
DIANE: ( putting down her Snickers ) Look, I might be moody. I might be gassy. But I am perfectly sane. Think about it. In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true." Right?
KANSAS: Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
DIANE: And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money. Your mom only shot a guy.
HANNAH: Or, I could get my own horse.
DIANE: Or that! Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby. I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand. I could open that safe in my sleep!
KANSAS: I'm in.
LUCY: Stop it! This is crazy!
CLEO: I'm in, too.
LUCY: Kansas is right. We're like sisters we're closer than sisters. And you don't turn your back on family.
CLEO: Kansas is right. We're like sisters we're closer than sisters. And you don't turn your back on family.
DIANE: C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
LUCY: And they get caught!
DIANE: That's right. So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
CLEO: And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
LUCY: Forget it. I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head. I won't risk it.
CLEO: ( sotto, to Kansas ) Conan went to Harvard.
KANSAS: ( sotto ) Shut up.
DIANE: Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
LUCY: If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
DIANE: If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
LUCY: . I don't know. Probably not.
DIANE: So then this isn't crazy. It's a sure
LUCY: Squad AD-LIBS their encouragement.
DIANE: Of course - of course! Hands in.
GEEKY GUY: . I feel utterly abandoned in a place that values physical prowess over mental acuity. I can't wait for all this to change once we get in the real world.
LISA: . I do! I totally marry Prince William even if he was gay. I mean, in England all guys are kinda gay anyway. Even cigarettes are fags over there.
CLEO: .He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the

DIANE: Uh, Jack - look, I can explain.
JACK: Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins. Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
TED: Uh, Cleo.would you just say my name?
HANNAH: .so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes.
KANSAS: Wait a minute. You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
HANNAH: I'm only allowed "G" movies.
KANSAS: ( losing it ) Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
HUSBAND: Excuse me, could you please keep your voice down? We're not introducing anger into the womb.
KANSAS: ( snapping back ) Well how'd you like me to introduce my foot into your ass?
DIANE: ( lowering her voice ) I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies
KANSAS: ( lowering her voice ) I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies
HANNAH: Those of us who have parents, know that they have rules because they care!
KANSAS: You sure you wanna go there?
HANNAH: ( nervously standing ) 'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!" Diane Weston?
KANSAS: 'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!" Diane Weston?
NURSE: Diane Weston?
CLEO: Di, we're sorry. We.
DIANE: It's off. I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority
KANSAS: Di, it's not your fault. We all wanted to do this - for you. for ourselves.
HANNAH: Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie. I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
DIANE: That's okay, Hannah. It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies. Sex - you can learn from movies. But robberies? There's no
CLEO: Ahh! Baby's got two heads!!!
LUCY: It's twins!!
DIANE: Oh, thank G-d! I'm not just super fat!
KANSAS: ( building ) Oh - okay, we ain't done with this. Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load! We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals! I'm gonna visit my mom!

MRS. HILL: You don't look nothing like your pictures. What happened to the curly red hair?

MRS. HILL: ( near tears ) So you need my help? Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your ( calling behind her ) Hey, Mink, c'mere!

JACK: ( talking to Diane's belly ) .so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled. "Run to my voice - and don't look back." The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!
