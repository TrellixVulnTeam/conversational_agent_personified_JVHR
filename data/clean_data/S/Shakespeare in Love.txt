HENSLOWE: ( catching up ) Who is she this time?!
WILL: She is always Aphrodite.
HENSLOWE: Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
WILL: Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
HENSLOWE: Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
WILL: What piece? Richard Crookback?
HENSLOWE: Noit's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
WILL: Who wrote that?
HENSLOWE: Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
WILL: Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
HENSLOWE: . . . Will! What is money to you and me? I, your patron, you my wordwright! When the plague lifts Burbage will have a new Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain and I have nothing for the
WILL: Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty Fifty pounds? What for?
HENSLOWE: ( staggered ) Fifty pounds? What for?
WILL: Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
HENSLOWE: Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
WILL: ( answering for him ) No, then.
MAKEPEACE: and the Lord shall smite them! Yea, harken to me. The theatres are handmaidens of the devil! Under the name of the Curtain, the players breed lewdness in your wives, rebellion in your servants, idleness in your apprentices and wickedness in your children! And the Rose smells thusly rank by any name! I say a plague on both their houses!
HENSLOWE: Where are you going?
WILL: To my weekly confession.
WILL: Words, words, words once, I had the gift I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery but now

WILL: ( interrupting ) Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
DR. MOTH: I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
WILL: I have lost my gift. It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
DR. MOTH: Nothing comes.
WILL: Nothing comes.
DR. MOTH: Most interesting.
WILL: It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
DR. MOTH: ( shrewdly ) Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
WILL: A goodly length in times past, but No, no. You have a wife, children
DR. MOTH: No, no. You have a wife, children
LATER: Not much sand left.
WILL: I was a lad of eighteen. Anne Hathaway was a woman, half as old again.
DR. MOTH: A woman of property?
WILL: ( shrugs ) She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
DR. MOTH: And your relations?
WILL: On my mother's side the Ardens
DR. MOTH: No, your marriage bed.
WILL: Four years and a hundred miles away in A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
DR. MOTH: So now you are free to love
WILL: yet cannot love nor write it.
DR. MOTH: Here is a bangle found in Psyche's temple on Olympus cheap at four pence. Write your name on a paper and feed it in the snake.
WILL: Will it restore my gift?
DR. MOTH: The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
HENSLOWE: Now where? Will?
WILL: To the Palace at Whitehall.
WILL: ( approaching ) Prithee, Mr. Kempe, break a leg. You too, good Crab.
KEMPE: Crab is nervous. He has never played the Palace. When will you write me a tragedy, Will? I could do it.
WILL: No, they would laugh at Seneca if you played it.
BURBAGE: ( to ROSALINE ) My sleeve wants for a button, Mistress Rosaline, where were my seamstress's

BURBAGE: Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's When I have fifty pounds.
WILL: When I have fifty pounds.
BURBAGE: Are you writing?
WILL: ( nods somewhat defensively ) A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
BURBAGE: What is the chief part?
WILL: Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
BURBAGE: The title?
WILL: I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
BURBAGE: I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
WILL: It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
BURBAGE: How much?
WILL: Ten pounds.
BURBAGE: You're a liar.
WILL: I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
BURBAGE: Ned is wrong for it.
WILL: ( arriving ) Burbage, I will see you hanged for a The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
HENSLOWE: ( arriving ) Burbage, I will see you hanged for a The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
BURBAGE: The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
HENSLOWE: And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
BURBAGE: Ask him.
TILNEY: She comes!
ROSALINE: When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
WILL: I have lost my gift.
ROSALINE: You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
WILL: Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
ROSALINE: Burbage has my keeping but you have my You see? The consumptives plot against me. "Will Shakespeare has a play, let us go and cough through it."
WILL: You see? The consumptives plot against me. "Will Shakespeare has a play, let us go and cough through it."
WILL: I feel a scene coming on.
HENSLOWE: Is it about a pirate's daughter?
HENSLOWE: You see? Comedy. Well played, Master Crab, I commend
QUEEN: Well played, Master Crab, I commend
HENSLOWE: Love and a bit with a dog, that's what they like.
HENSLOWE: There's a lady knows your play by
VIOLA: Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
NURSE: I liked the dog, for laughs.
VIOLA: But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see When the Queen commands it.
NURSE: When the Queen commands it.
VIOLA: But at the playhouse. Nurse?
NURSE: Be still. Playhouses are not for well-born I am not so well-born.
VIOLA: I am not so well-born.
NURSE: Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
VIOLA: All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
NURSE: Like Valentine and Silvia?
VIOLA: No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play. I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
NURSE: As a nurse.
VIOLA: ( kissing her ) But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
NURSE: Clean your teeth while you dream, Now spit
FENNYMAN: This time we take your boots off!

FENNYMAN: The theatres are all closed by the Oh, that.
HENSLOWE: Oh, that.
FENNYMAN: by order of the Master of the Revels!
HENSLOWE: Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a So what do we do?
FENNYMAN: So what do we do?
HENSLOWE: Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
FENNYMAN: I don't know. It's a mystery.
HENSLOWE: I don't know. It's a mystery.

WILL: ( to ROSALINE ) I would have made you immortal. ( turning to go ) Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
TILNEY: What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.

TILNEY: I have, Master Shakespeare.
WILL: But the plague

RALPH: I was a Pirate King, now I'm a Nurse. That's funny
WILL: We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
HENSLOWE: We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.

FENNYMAN: Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe

WESSEX: Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
NURSE: It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
WESSEX: It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and My lady VIOLA.
VIOLA: Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
WESSEX: I am aware of it, but it is beauty's You flatter, my lord.
VIOLA: You flatter, my lord.
WESSEX: No. I have spoken to the Queen. Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
VIOLA: Do you intend to marry, my lord?
WESSEX: Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday. You are allowed to show your pleasure.
VIOLA: I do not love you, my lord.
WESSEX: How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Why, yes!

VIOLA: But why me?
WESSEX: It was your eyes. No, your lips.
VIOLA: The Queen has consented?
WESSEX: She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
VIOLA: ( forced to submit ) I will do my duty, my lord.
ALLEYN: Gentlemen upstage, ladies downstage!
WILL: ( preempting ) You did not like the speech?
ALLEYN: The speech is excellent. "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
WILL: There you have his duel, a skirmish of words and swords such as I never wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such passion and poetry as your ever heard: "a plague on both your houses!" He dies?
ALLEYN: He dies?
BURBAGE: WILL is in too much of a hurry to stop. BURBAGE calls after him.
WILL: ( O.S. shouting ) Did you give her my letter?
WILL: Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
BOATMAN: Writer, is he?
WILL: Row your boat.
WILL: She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
WILL: And break her heart and mine?
WILL: She loves me, Thomas!
WILL: No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
WILL: Your aunt?
WILL: Like a sickness and its cure together.
WILL: Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
WILL: Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
WILL: Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
WILL: Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosomdid I mention her bosom?
WILL: Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
WILL: ( fervently ) Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
WILL: For one kiss, I would defy a thousand
VIOLA: Oh, Will! Thank you, my lady!
BOATMAN: Thank you, my lady!
WILL: ( stunned ) Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a

WILL: Can you love a fool?
VIOLA: Can you love a player?
WILL: ( springs back ) Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
VIOLA: Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William I am.
WILL: I am.
VIOLA: Then kiss me again for I am not
WILL: It is strange to me, too.
NURSE: Go to, go to.
VIOLA: I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
WILL: There is.
VIOLA: Even your play.
WILL: ( frowns ) And that was only my first try.
VIOLA: And that was only my first try.
WILL: Well perhaps better than my first.
VIOLA: Then he starts to get out of bed.
WILL: I must. Look how pale the window.
VIOLA: ( pulling him down ) No, the morning rooster woke me.
WILL: No, the morning rooster woke me.
VIOLA: It was the owlcome to bed
WILL: ( giving in ) Oh, let Henslowe wait.
VIOLA: ( pausing, pushing him away ) Mr. Henslowe?
WILL: ( persisting ) Let him be damned for his pages!
VIOLA: Ohno, no!
WILL: ( kissing her ) There is time. It is still dark.
VIOLA: It is broad day! The rooster tells us so!
WILL: It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
VIOLA: You would leave us players without a scene to read today?!
NURSE: My lady, the house is stirring, it is a new day.
VIOLA: It is a new world!
SAM: ( prompting her ) It's you.
ALLEYN: ( roars ) Suffering cats!
WILL: Yes yes er not quite right it is more let me "Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
ALLEYN: ( to Will, sarcastically ) Well! It was lucky you were here! Why do not I write the rest of your play while you
WILL: ( apologising, retreating ) Yes, yes continue. Now the Nurse. Where is Ralph?
VIOLA: ( to Will ) Oh let it be night!
VIOLA: Oh, do not go
WILL: I must. I must
VIOLA: ( reading ) "Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she "
WILL: Yes, some of it is speakable.
VIOLA: ( continuing reading ) "It is my lady, O it is my love! O that she knew she were!"
WILL: ( reading through VIOLA'S "Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy "Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love And I'll no longer be a Capulet."
WILL: "What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night So stumblest on my " By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee "
WILL: "The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here. If they do see thee, they will murder thee."
WILL: "Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
VIOLA: That's my line!
WILL: Oh, but it is mine too!
WILL: "My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep:

WILL: ( to PETER ) How is it?
PETER: ( shrugs ) It's all right.
WILL: Ned I know I know
ALLEYN: It's good.
WILL: The title won't do.
ALLEYN: The title won't do.
WILL: Romeo and Julietjust a suggestion.
ALLEYN: Romeo and Julietjust a suggestion.
WILL: Thank you, Ned.
ALLEYN: And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
HENSLOWE: ( in disbelief ) You mean, no dog of any kind?
PETER: ( to HENSLOWE ) The Friar married them in secret, then Ned gets into a fight with one of the Capulets, Romeo tries to stop them, he gets in Ned's way, I mean in Mercutio's way, so Tybalt kills Mercutio and then Romeo kills Tybalt. Then the Prince banishes him from ( much relieved ) That must be when he goes on the voyage and gets shipwrecked on the island of the Pirate King.
HENSLOWE: ( much relieved ) That must be when he goes on the voyage and gets shipwrecked on the island of the Pirate King.
FENNYMAN: Cease your prattling! Get out! A thousand apologies!
WILL: Sunday it is Sunday.
VIOLA: Oh, but it will end well for love?
WILL: In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my loversfamily, duty, fateas unchangeable as nature.
VIOLA: ( sobered ) Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
VIOLA: Sunday! Greenwich!
WESSEX: Now, pay attention, Nursy. The Queen, Gloriana Regina, God's Chosen Vessel, the Radiant One, who shines her light on us, is at Greenwich today, and prepared, during the evening's festivities, to bestow her gracious favour on my choice of wifeand if we're late for lunch, the old boot will not forgive. So you get you to my lady's chamber and produce her with or without her undergarments.
WILL: You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
VIOLA: What will you have me do? Marry you To be the wife of a poor player?can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
WILL: ( brought up short ) To be the wife of a poor player?can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
VIOLA: ( tartly ) You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
WILL: Then I will go with you.
VIOLA: You cannot, Wessex will kill you
WILL: I know how to fight!
VIOLA: ( now fixing her hair ) Stage fighting! ( turn to him ) Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
WESSEX: ( ranting ) By heaven, I will drag her down, by the Queen's command
VIOLA: Good morning, my lord!
WESSEX: ( impressed by her appearance ) Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for Here we come at last, my lord!
WILL: Here we come at last, my lord!
WESSEX: ( taken aback ) Are you bringing your laundry woman?
WILL: Her chaperone. My lady's country My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
WESSEX: On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
WILL: Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
WESSEX: ( to him ) ( to Viola ) The Queen asks for you. Answer well.
WESSEX: ( to Viola ) The Queen asks for you. Answer well.
WILL: A man, my lord?
WESSEX: ( impatiently ) There was a man, poeta theatre poet, I hearddoes he come to the house?
WILL: A theatre poet?
WESSEX: An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowehas he been to the house?
WILL: Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
WESSEX: ( venomously ) That dog!
VIOLA: Your Majesty.
QUEEN: Stand up straight, girl.
VIOLA: ( agreeing ) Your Majesty.
QUEEN: What do you love so much?
VIOLA: Your Majesty
QUEEN: Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
VIOLA: I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
QUEEN: ( interrupting ) They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
VIOLA: And I love poetry above all.
QUEEN: Above Lord Wessex?
VIOLA: ( blurts ) Oh, but they can!
WESSEX: Lady Viola is young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
QUEEN: I thought you were here because you had none.
WILL: Fifty pounds! Fifty pounds! A very worthy sum on a very worthy question. Can a play show us the very truth and nature of love? I bear witness to the wager, and will be the judge of it as occasion arises. I have not seen anything to settle it Sothe fireworks will be soothing after the excitements of Lady Viola's Have her then, but you are a lordly fool. She has been plucked since I saw her last, and not by you. It takes a woman to know it.

MARLOWE: The creaking stops.
BURBAGE'S VOICE: Who's there?
MARLOWE: BURBAGE'S VOICE
BURBAGE'S VOICE: INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. BEDROOM. DAY. MARLOWE enters, ignoring the situation on the bed where ROSALINE is astride BURBAGE.
MARLOWE: You are playing my Faustus this afternoon. Don't spend yourself in This afternoon!we'll still be here this afternoon.
ROSALINE: ( working hard ) This afternoon!we'll still be here this afternoon.
BURBAGE: What do you want, Kit?
MARLOWE: My Massacre at Paris is complete.
BURBAGE: You have the last act?
MARLOWE: You have the money?
BURBAGE: ( leaving ) Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
MARLOWE: ( leaving ) Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
BURBAGE: ( to ROSALINE ) Will you desist!
MARLOWE: Twenty pounds on delivery
BURBAGE: What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
MARLOWE: Romeo?he gave it to Henslowe.
BURBAGE: Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
MARLOWE: Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
BURBAGE: I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
MARLOWE: ( leaving ) You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
BURBAGE: BURBAGE rouses himself violently, throwing ROSALINE off the bed. The glass bracelet is flung from her wrist. It breaks on the floor, releasing a strip of paper. BURBAGE picks it up. What he reads on it does not please him: it is WILL'S signature.
ALLEYN: Are you going to do it like that? And before the humbled actor can reply NED And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something, make it a word and a blow.
BURBAGE: Where is that thieving hack who can't keep his pen in his own ink pot!?
WILL: What is this rabble?!
FENNYMAN: ( to HENSLOWE ) Wonderful, wonderful! And a dog!
HENSLOWE: Not with my props!
VIOLA: Will! What?
WILL: A literary feud. Quite normal.
WILL: I dreamed last night of a shipwreck. You were cast ashore in a far country.
HENSLOWE: We need that for the balcony scene!
FENNYMAN: ( horrified ) My investment! LAMBERT!!!
VENGEANCE!: HENSLOWE attempts to intervene.
HENSLOWE: I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
FENNYMAN: Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
FENNYMAN: ( shouts ) A famous victory! Kegs and legs. Open and on the house! Oh what happy hour! ( and grabbing a RADDLED
WHORE ): Poxy Pol! You keep yourself to yourself I'll not have you infecting my investment!
WILL ): Is this a tavern?
WILL: It is also a tavern.
PRETTY WHORE: I remember you! The poet!
SECOND WHORE: ( to VIOLA ) Oh, he's a pretty one! Tell me your story while I tickle your fancy!
WILL: It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
RALPH: ( declining the glass ) Never when I'm working!
PRETTY WHORE: Never tried it? Never? I think you are ready, Sam!
FENNYMAN: ( raising his glass ) You are welcome to my best house! Here's to the Admiral's Men!
SAM: ( to the PRETTIEST WHORE ) I quite liked it.
FENNYMAN: Master Kent! You have not dipped your My wick?
WILL: ( saving her ) Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
FENNYMAN: ( embracing WILL ) By heaven, I thank you! I will be your
WHORE: ( to RALPH ) And what is this play about?
RALPH: Well, there's this Nurse
FENNYMAN: Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
HENSLOWE: The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
WILL: By God, I wish I knew.
HENSLOWE: By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
PETER: ( shouts ) Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!
WILL: Oh what have I done?
ALLEYN: ( standing up ) He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
WILL: It was I who killed him! God forgive me, God forgive me!
WESSEX: You look sad, my lady! Let me take you It is not my riding day, my lord.
VIOLA: It is not my riding day, my lord.
WESSEX: Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
VIOLA: I am going to church.
WESSEX: ( recomposing his features to I understand of course. It is to be It is to be expected on a Sunday.
VIOLA: It is to be expected on a Sunday.
WESSEX: And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
VIOLA: ( cannot take this in ) Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
WESSEX: Oh!dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
VIOLA: ( faintly ) He is dead?
WESSEX: ( cheerfully solemn ) Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul My lady my lady now is the time to show your breeding.
NURSE: My lady my lady now is the time to show your breeding.
WESSEX: Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for the love of Christ!
VIOLA: He does not answer. She runs after him.
WILL: It is worse. I have killed a man.
WILL: Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
VIOLA: You never spoke so well of him.
WILL: He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
VIOLA: You lie.
WILL: My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
VIOLA: Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
WILL: I was the more deceived.
VOILA: Yesyou were deceived. For I never loved you till now.
WILL: ( declaring herself ) I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
VIOLA: ( declaring herself ) I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
WILL: Oh, my love You ran from me before.
VIOLA: You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
WILL: You cannot marry Wessex!
VIOLA: If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will
WILL: ( through his kisses ) But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are ( he is mid speech ) For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt, the one who killed Romeo's friend Mercutio, Romeo is banished
VIOLA: ( through his kisses ) But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are ( he is mid speech ) For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt, the one who killed Romeo's friend Mercutio, Romeo is banished
WILL: ( he is mid speech ) For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt, the one who killed Romeo's friend Mercutio, Romeo is banished
WILL: You, Edward. The Friar who married them gives Juliet a potion to drink. It is a secret potion. It makes her seeming dead. She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets. She will awake to life and love when Romeo comes to her side again.
FENNYMAN: That's me.
WILL: And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
HENSLOWE: Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
FENNYMAN: Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
ALLEYN: ( to WILL ) Yesit will serve. But there's a scene missing between marriage and death.
WILL: The play. All written out for you. I had the clerk at Bridewell do it, he has a good fist for lettering.
VIOLA: Will you read it for me?
WILL: ( he knows it ) "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
VIOLA: ( reading ) "It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and
WILL: "Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a
WILL: " thou need'st not to be gone."
VIOLA: "I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
TILNEY: You will go far, I fear.
FENNYMAN: "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them." Then him. Then me.
WEBSTER: My lord!
WESSEX: ( shouts )
WILL: You are on my ground.
WESSEX: ( drawing his sword ) By God, I'll fight the lot of you
WILL: I am more than enough.
ALLEYN: I rejoiced at his death because I thought it was yours. That is all I know of Marlowe.
WESSEX: I rejoiced at his death because I thought it was yours. That is all I know of Marlowe.
ALLEYN: It's true, Willit was a tavern brawl Marlowe attacked, and got his own knife in the eye. A quarrel about the bill
HENSLOWE: The bill! Oh, vanity, vanity!
ALLEYN: Not the billing, the bill!
WILL: ( to the heavens ) Oh God, I am free of it!
WESSEX: Close it!
TILNEY: My Lord Wessex!
WESSEX: ( foaming ) Close it! Take it down stone by stone! I want it ploughed into the ground, and sown with quick lime!
HENSLOWE: Mr. Tilney, what is this?
TILNEY: Sedition and indecency!
HENSLOWE: Master of the Revels, sir, over here, Where, boy?
WEBSTER: Master of the Revels, sir, over here, Where, boy?
TILNEY: ( to WEBSTER ) Where, boy?
WEBSTER: ( points ) I saw her bubbies!
TILNEY: ( shocked and gratified ) A woman on the stage? A woman?
WEBSTER: I swear it!
TILNEY: So, Henslowe! I say this theatre is closed! On the authority of the powers invested in my by the courtI close this theatre!
HENSLOWE: Why so?
TILNEY: ( triumphantly ) For lewdness and unshamefacedness! For displaying a female on the public
WEBSTER: ( pointing at SAM ) Not him. ( pointing at VIOLA ) He's a woman!
HENSLOWE: He's a woman!
TILNEY: That's who I meant! This theatre is closed! Notice will be posted!
HENSLOWE: ( to NED ) Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
VIOLA: ( hoping to protect WILL ) Nobody knew!
WEBSTER: ( pointing at WILL ) He did! I saw him kissing her bubbies!
TILNEY: Closed! Closed, mark you, Henslowe!
HENSLOWE: ( in despair ) It is over.
VIOLA: I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor. I am sorry, Will.
WABASH: Y-y-y-you w-w-w-were w-w-w-w- Thank you.
VIOLA: Thank you.
FENNYMAN: Everything all right?
FENNYMAN: ( muttering ) I would have been good I would have been great.
RALPH: So would I. We both would.
FENNYMAN: ( shouts )
ALLEYN: Well, Burbageyou never did know when your scene was over.
BURBAGE: That can wait. The Master of the Revels despises us for vagrants, tinkers, and peddlers of bombast. But my father, James Burbage, had the first licence to make a company of players from Her Majesty, and he drew from poets the literature of the age. Their fame will be our fame. So let them all know, we are men of parts. We are a brotherhood, and we will be a profession. Will Shakespeare has a play. I have a theatre. The Curtain is

WESSEX: Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
