PATEL You seemed to have trouble last Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean..

You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean..
DR. PATEL: He was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well.
PAT: Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best.
DR. PATEL: Pat, you have to have a strategy. I told you earlier. You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore. So when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can.
PAT: Yeah, but that's easier said than DR. PATEL You have to do it. You have no choice. Excelsior.
DR. PATEL: You have to do it. You have no choice. Excelsior.

PAT: ( SIGHS )
DR. PATEL: Why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night?
PAT: Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months?
DR. PATEL: Maybe you think that Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.
PAT: Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.
DR. PATEL: Why is she a slut?
PAT: After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out." Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.
DR. PATEL: Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her.
PAT: She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same?
DR. PATEL: Can you?
PAT: Is that..? You're asking me, you're really asking me that DR. PATEL With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?
DR. PATEL: With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?
PAT: With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?
DR. PATEL: Pat, the silver lining thing is yours. I'm just giving back your words to you. This "crazy sad shit," as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books.
PAT: No, not the books.
DR. PATEL: You said Nikki's friends with Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if you become friends with Tiffany, Nikki will think that you're a kind, generous, large-hearted person, who helps people in need, who is basically thriving. So if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you.
TIFFANY: THEY RUN.
PAT: How do you know when I run?
TIFFANY: I wanted to clarify something. I just want us to be friends. ( Pat doesn't answer ) Did you hear what I said? ( Pat doesn't answer still ) Why are you giving me such a hard No, I'm not giving you a hard time.

TIFFANY: And the so-called incident with the Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well.

TIFFANY: I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister.
PAT: It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.
TIFFANY: I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.
PAT: But you would do it?
TIFFANY: I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how I lost my job.

PAT: Oh.my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe we should change the subject.
TIFFANY: I don't mind it.
PAT: You don't, do you.
TIFFANY: No. But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom.and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me. So I accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds.

It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat. ( pause ) That's a feeling.

RANDY: Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a PAT SR. Randy. ( to Pat ) I just hope you heard what I said. It's like a family business, it's our family endeavor. We all stick together on this. That's how it works. That's a positive, positive vibe.
PAT: I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it's good for me, Dad. It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's, it's, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing.

TIFFANY: Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?
PAT: No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because I'm not with him during the games.
TIFFANY: Guess what?

TIFFANY: Nikki replied to your letter.
PAT: Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything else without reading Nikki's letter, okay? It's just, it's in the back of my head. We don't almost have it, all right?

PAT: Thank you.
TIFFANY: She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.
PAT: She was scared? About what? Did she tell you?
TIFFANY: Try to stay positive.
PAT: I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay? Because if she says anything that's, you know, is that too much to ask?
TIFFANY: PAT LOOKS DOWN AT THE LETTER, READING SILENTLY.
PAT: Okay. Sorry.
TIFFANY: ( follows him to door ) She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something. You would have never done something like this in a million years.

PAT: Can I use your phone?

PAT: I am solid. I was solid at the game, Dad. I'm solid, I'm solid PAT SR. You fell apart! What are you fucking talking about?!
DR. PATEL: Your son was trying to
PAT: No, Dad!
PAT: No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't!
PAT: No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing! Come on, Dad!
PAT: ( EMOTIONAL )
DR. PATEL: He was defending his brother!
PAT CRIES: PAT SR. You fucking idiot! You spike the ball on the one yard line, you fucking idiot!
TIFFANY: We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up!
PAT: Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called, but I tried to call you, Tiffany,
I: PAT SR. Who is this? What is this?
TIFFANY: Oh, really?
PAT: PAT ( CONT'D )
TIFFANY: Well, that sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help. I'm Tiffany, by the way.
PAT: There's no craziness. I told you who she was, I was doing this thing with her. We had a conversation!
TIFFANY: You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you?
TIFFANY: ( INTERRUPTING )
TIFFANY: I'm the reason why today happened?
TIFFANY: Let's talk about that.
TIFFANY: The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS.
JAKE: She's right, Dad.
TIFFANY: The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty- seven to fourteen.
PAT: The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two.
TIFFANY: The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two.
PAT: Oh, wow.
TIFFANY: Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven.
TIFFANY: He was with me. We went for a run.
RONNIE: Really? That's crazy.
TIFFANY: There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.
JAKE: She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts.
TIFFANY: Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? ( to Pat Sr. ) Do you? Do you know? "Excelsior." Look it up. Yeah, "Excelsior."
DOLORES: Oh Pat.
TIFFANY: Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.
RONNIE: Wow. How did you know all that I did my research.
PAT: Wow. How did you know all that I did my research.
TIFFANY: I did my research.
TIFFANY: Thank you.
PAT: Oh, now you like her, Dad?
RANDY: Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.
TIFFANY: Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been betting against my father for Is that right?
PAT: Is that right?
TIFFANY: You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it!
RANDY: That's bullshit! That's not true! Don't say that!
TIFFANY: You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it.
RANDY: How do you want me to prove it?
TIFFANY: By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing.
PAT: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
RANDY: Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week? Is that what you're She pauses, turns dramatically to Randy.
TIFFANY: She pauses, turns dramatically to Randy.
PAT: That's his team!
TIFFANY: I know who his team is.
RANDY: When is the game?
TIFFANY: December twenty-eight, last game of the season.
PAT: Oh, my God.
TIFFANY: Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Oh God.
DOLORES: Oh God.
TIFFANY: Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?
RANDY: Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing.
DOLORES: No. No, Patrizio
PAT: Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!
DOLORES: Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!
PAT: PAT SR. not in the State of New York. In this house.
DAD: PAT SR. not in the State of New York. In this house.
PAT: Dad, listen to me. I didn't know that "Excelsior" was the state motto of New York, okay?
PAT: I know, but listen to me, this is toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is toxic, you shouldn't be doing this, you shouldn't be doing
DOLORES: Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't you take the bet!
PAT: No, Dad! Dad!
JAKE: PAT SR. You have to take that bet on the Dolores, would you stop him?
RANDY: Dolores, would you stop him?
JAKE: PAT SR. How could you not take that bet? Even with the ten points I give you, that's an insane spread to your advantage. Cowboys are cowards. And I'll bet you're such a coward, you won't take the ten. Plus, are you listening, plus whatever their score is at the dance thing. ( to Tiffany ) What's that? Tiffany, what's that?
PAT: What? No, no, no, no.
RANDY: You're crazy to give away that many points. That's ridiculous! I won't take that! However, wait a second. I do like the idea of a parlay.
DOLORES: What? No parlay! No!
PAT: No, don't do it. Don't do it.
RANDY: Pat, how do they run this dance competition? I mean, how do they score it and everything?
PAT: I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score! We're participating. We're not, we're not a part of it. There are people, this is a high- end dance contest. I don't know. Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy. Don't
TIFFANY: They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores.
RANDY: Okay, score is from one to ten, right? And you guys are how good?
PAT: We suck.
TIFFANY: We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.
RANDY: And how are the people you're competing against?
TIFFANY: They're good. Some of them are They're good? Better than you? Pause. Tiffany says nothing.
RANDY: They're good? Better than you? Pause. Tiffany says nothing.
PAT: A lot better.
RANDY: A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away
PAT: No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away
TIFFANY: Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a We can't get five!
PAT: We can't get five!
TIFFANY: We can do a five.
PAT: What are you talking about, Dad? You haven't even seen us dance!
RANDY: That's the parlay.
DR. PATEL: Will somebody please explain to me the parlay? Please?
RONNIE: You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance.
DR. PATEL: That's very, very manic indeed.
RONNIE: That's the parlay.
RANDY: Shake on it.
PAT: You know what? I'm not gonna be a part of this. ( to Randy ) Randy, Randy, you're a sickness. You're a fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.
TIFFANY: Pat, you can't quit.
PAT: I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.
TIFFANY: Pat, calm down. Thank about it.
PAT: See you later.
TIFFANY: Pat, no.
TIFFANY: ( WALKING OUT )
PAT: ( WALKING OUT )
PAT: What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on.I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.
TIFFANY: You are not a stand up guy right now. If it's me reading the signs.if it's me reading the
SIGNS: If it's you reading the signs? You're reading the signs? Oh, okay.
PAT: If it's you reading the signs? You're reading the signs? Oh, okay.
DOLORES: You are not a stand up guy!
TIFFANY: You are not a stand up guy!
