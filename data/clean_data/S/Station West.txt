STATION WEST: Written by Based on a novel by Luke Short
SHOOTING DRAFT: JULY 22, 1947
FADE IN: The sky is pure blue, exquisitely blemished by huge cumulus clouds, floating lazily. A single bird sails past. From the sky the CAMERA MOVES TO earth. Here, too, all is tranquil. The trees, bright green in the sunlight, move only to the slight but constant breeze. Now the CAMERA MOVES DOWN, revealing a wagon to which is hitched a team of horses beside the road. The wagon is at an awkward angle, but upright. It is wedged between two rocks where the horses have pulled it as they tried to reach some forage. Its seat is empty. In the bed of the wagon several sacks lie, bearing the legend: The sacks are empty and slashed as by a knife. The ropes that bound them are cleanly severed. The disorder in the wagon indicates haste. Two horses are hitched to it, munching grass or the high leaves of a tree overhead. All that is odd or unnatural is that the reins have fallen askew and trail the ground. Now the CAMERA MOVES AWAY and ALONG tracks made by the wagon when it left the road. ON THE ROAD two horses stand. These are saddled, but riderless. The rifle holsters are empty. CAMERA MOVES TO the ground. There on the road lies the rifle. The dust is slightly blowing across it, moved by the persistent summery little breeze. From the rifle, the CAMERA MOVES ON A LITTLE and STOPS ABRUPTLY ON the sprawled dead figure of a soldier, then another, face down in the road. CLOSE SHOT of the dead soldiers, as the CAMERA HOLDS ON them. Near the hand of one a revolver lies, the fine dust coating it. Dust blowing over the uniforms, as though seeking to hide the shame of a murder. As it blows over their still figures, the SOUND of BIRDS coming over:
FADE OUT: FADE IN ROCK PASS - NIGHT This is a western mining town of the Eighties that has mushroomed up around a gold strike. On the streets prospectors and miners mingle with merchants. As the CAMERA PICKS UP the scene, a lumber wagon passes, bearing logs, a ten team wagon, its trailer filled with ore from the stamp mills and bearing the legend: ARGUS MINE. A stage coach comes in as we:

A stage coach comes in as we:
DISSOLVE: INT. HOTEL - NIGHT On the hotel clerk, as he sits behind the desk, playing a guitar and singing pensively the ballad of the story. As he sings, JOHN HAVEN, newly arrived on the stagecoach, walks in, gazes at the clerk with a slight smile, finding the clerk completely indifferent to the arrival of anybody, at last leaves the bag and saunters out.
DISSOLVE: EXT. SALOON - NIGHT As Haven leaves the hotel and has reached the saloon, a well- lighted, plush-looking spot, illumined by kerosene flares. Sticking a pipe in his mouth, Haven saunters in.
STICKMAN: Eight the hard way! Pay the line!
STICKMAN: Seven a winner.
HAVEN: No, thanks.
STELLMAN: Know him?
PRINCE: No. Why?
STELLMAN: He just seems kind of free with that
HAVEN: ( to barman ) Whiskey like you'd pour it for
BLONDE: Don't you know it's no fun to drink Not till after the first one.
HAVEN: Not till after the first one.
STELLMAN: You a stranger here?
HAVEN: ( to barman, after gulping it in one gulp ) What kind of whiskey was that?
BARMAN: On the bottle it says Rye but the way you take it, I don't see what difference it makes.
HAVEN: Another Rye. You didn't answer my question.
STELLMAN: ( easily ) You didn't answer my question.
HAVEN: I'm a stranger everywhere.
STELLMAN: Got a job?
HAVEN: Listen, soldier. I know that one, too. Got a job, stranger? No? Why don't you join the Army? Three meals a day, a place to sleep, a nice warm It has a little more than that.
STELLMAN: It has a little more than that.
HAVEN: ( deliberately ) Yeah, it has one thing more, and that's what I could never take ( looking at Stellman's stripes ) It's got Second-Lieutenants. If you want to make it a personal ( coldly ) I don't make it anything, soldier. You tried to sell something and I didn't buy it so why don't you just beat it?
STELLMAN: If you want to make it a personal I don't make it anything, soldier. You tried to sell something and I didn't buy it so why don't you just beat it?
HAVEN: ( coldly ) I don't make it anything, soldier. You tried to sell something and I didn't buy it so why don't you just beat it?
STELLMAN: If I weren't in uniform, I might teach you some manners.
HAVEN: If you could teach me anything, you wouldn't be in a uniform.
BARMAN: You couldn't be looking for trouble, could you?
HAVEN: I could, but I'm not.
BARMAN: That's fine, because this is one of the best places West of the Atlantic Ocean to find it.
HAVEN: That was my first impression.
BARMAN: ( as Haven looks at him ) That Lieutenant's a nice young boy.
HAVEN: I don't doubt it, but his mouth is too big like your ears.
BLONDE: How is it now?
HAVEN: Drinking alone?
BLONDE: Drinking alone?
HAVEN: ( flipping her a coin ) It's all right try it.
CHARLIE: It's not a good habit if it makes you pick fights.
HAVEN: Only with Second Lieutenants.
CHARLIE: We like Second Lieutenants here.
CHARLIE: You see here everybody fights, except the Army.
HAVEN: I wouldn't know
CHARLIE: ( still smiling ) So anyone who doesn't like the Army
HAVEN: I know what you mean, but I'm afraid I'll have to come back. I like the way you sing.
CROUPIER: Okay, Charlie?
CHARLIE: That's his limit.
CROUPIER: There's a sucker getting hot with the dice at Ed's table.
CHARLIE: Well cool him off.
STELLMAN: Captain Iles the Commanding Officer of the Post.
STELLMAN: Mr. Haven sir.
ILES: I see you finally got here.
HAVEN: ( pleasantly ) I seem to finally get everywhere.
ILES: ( introducing ) Mrs. Caslon, Mr. Haven.
ILES: You've met Mr. Stellman.
STELLMAN: It came off beautifully. He picks a very good fight. In fact, I think I'm still a little sore at him.
ILES: ( grunting ) Sit down, Mr. Haven.
HAVEN: Thank you, Captain.
ILES: So you're operating under sealed
ILES: ( disgruntled ) All this mumbo jumbo is characteristic of the Military Information We use it as sparingly as possible.
HAVEN: We use it as sparingly as possible.
ILES: I've been in this territory for a number of years and I think it might be a little rougher here than a suburb of Washington, D.C.
HAVEN: Very possibly.
ILES: Then why is M.I.D. sending you out Because two soldiers have been And they think I can't handle that?
HAVEN: Because two soldiers have been And they think I can't handle that?
ILES: And they think I can't handle that?
HAVEN: They merely know you haven't.
ILES: I have only ninety-four men on the post, with Indian trouble up north. The War Department has refused to send reinforcements, or am I boring I'm not the War Department.
HAVEN: ( looking bored ) I'm not the War Department.
ILES: ( explaining ) The two soldiers were killed while escorting one of the gold stages.
HAVEN: ( quietly ) Is escorting gold a function of your Young man, the functions of my command look very pretty on paper, but they're not very practical in a territory like this. Do you have any illusions about that?
ILES: Young man, the functions of my command look very pretty on paper, but they're not very practical in a territory like this. Do you have any illusions about that?
HAVEN: I have no illusions about anything.
HAVEN: What's happening to the gold?
ILES: I've permitted it to be stored in a warehouse on the post. Now everybody is waiting to see what I do next.
HAVEN: What do you do next?
ILES: ( with sarcasm ) Aren't you here to tell me?
HAVEN: ( lighting the pipe ) Captain, you're in a bad way. ( going over to discard the match ) Wells Fargo won't convoy gold. You tried and failed and two men are dead. The gold is piling up on the post and you can't move it. Your post is under-manned. You want the Quartermaster at Platte to replace seventy uniforms sent to the freight office at West Rim City
ILES: The freight building burned down with the uniforms! I'm not operating a fire department and if I was, West Rim City is sixty miles away!
HAVEN: That doesn't concern me either.
ILES: What does?
HAVEN: The killing of two soldiers.
ILES: They were my men, Haven, and I'm trying every way I know to find out who murdered them.
HAVEN: So will I. You'll find it harder than you think. I don't know how you operate, but it's a dangerous job that can get you killed.
ILES: You'll find it harder than you think. I don't know how you operate, but it's a dangerous job that can get you killed.
HAVEN: Perhaps I can get some help from the You can forget him. He's a miserable man that somebody is using to keep the law a joke.
ILES: You can forget him. He's a miserable man that somebody is using to keep the law a joke.
HAVEN: You make it sound very difficult. Why don't you just wrap up your flag and take it back East with you?
ILES: ( smarting ) Tell me, how will I know what you're I'll let you know from time to time.
HAVEN: I'll let you know from time to time.
ILES: ( coldly ) That's very obliging of you.
HAVEN: But I don't want to visit the Army Then report to me through Mrs. Caslon here. You can be a friend of her husband's. He owned the Argus mine and died last year. If that meets your approval.
ILES: Then report to me through Mrs. Caslon here. You can be a friend of her husband's. He owned the Argus mine and died last year. If that meets your approval.
HAVEN: Only if it meets with hers.
MRS. CASLON: I'd be delighted to help.
ILES: ( grim at the smile ) Is that all?
HAVEN: I think so.
MRS. CASLON: He really isn't that abrupt he
ILES: Goodnight, Mary.
MRS. CASLON: ( warmly ) Goodnight, George.
MRS. CASLON: You see?
HAVEN: I see.
MRS. CASLON: I think he secretly likes you.
HAVEN: He's a man who can sure keep a secret.
MRS. CASLON: ( smiles ) Would you like a little sherry?
HAVEN: Only if you have some too.
HAVEN: Thank you.
MRS. CASLON: To your good luck.
HAVEN: What mine did the two soldiers try to convoy the gold from?
MRS. CASLON: My mine The Argus.
HAVEN: ( smiling a little ) That brings me to a question I decided not to ask.
MRS. CASLON: ( smiling back at him ) Then I'll answer it first. Captain Iles has asked me to marry him.
HAVEN: I can understand that.
MRS. CASLON: ( quietly ) But you can't understand why Captain Iles should be involved in the gold ( smiling ) I do now.
HAVEN: ( smiling ) I do now.
MRS. CASLON: It isn't just mine. You must realize there's a lot of gold from all over the territory stored at the post How much.
HAVEN: How much.
MRS. CASLON: Perhaps as much as half a million. In fact, I have about fifty thousand in my safe now.
HAVEN: Who is doing all this?
MRS. CASLON: I don't know. that's the worst part of it. not knowing.
HAVEN: ( puts down the glass, pats her shoulder with casual reassurance ) I might find out.
MRS. CASLON: Don't get into trouble
HAVEN: That's why I'm here.
MRS. CASLON: I know, but
HAVEN: Don't worry about it. Trouble and I are old enemies. We understand each Good luck.
MRS. CASLON: ( smiling again ) Good luck.
HAVEN: You didn't tell me your husband's
MRS. CASLON: ( repeating it )
HAVEN: ( repeating it )
DISSOLVE: EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT As Haven saunters along. He pauses, glances up at a sign that reads: HOTEL. Then he enters the dingy building.
ORVILLE: Evenin' stranger.
HAVEN: You must know everybody in town.
ORVILLE: Everybody but one. I don't know you.
HAVEN: What's your name? You seem to be a pretty clever fellow.
ORVILLE: Orville Weekly, and I can't be a total blank. I been here six years and I ain't dead yet.
HAVEN: Have you got a vacant room?
ORVILLE: Day, week, month?
HAVEN: I don't always know. And the way you talk a man couldn't be very sure.
ORVILLE: Then it's eight bucks, cash in
ORVILLE: From Arizona, huh?
HAVEN: No I always put down where I'm going next so I won't forget.
ORVILLE: Room ten end of the hall. Make your own bed. Furnish your own towels. Your bag's over there.
HAVEN: ( picking up the key ) Thanks a lot for the key. I'll be back later.
DISSOLVE: INT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - NIGHT As Haven enters. It is crowded. Haven pauses by a table. He sees Charlie at the piano singing. He sees Mick cross to Prince and say something, then Prince gazes in his direction. Haven's eyes meet those of Prince suddenly turned to him, cold as glass. Charlie, seeing that Haven is watching and listening to her impromptu singing, stops and makes her way through the crowd towards a booth off the dance floor. Haven's eyes follow her. MED. SHOT - of booth as Charlie sits down. A sandwich is waiting for her. She takes a bite of it, then glances up to see Haven standing beside the table.
HAVEN: How about eating alone? Is that a bad habit too?
CHARLIE: Just when you have to pay for it.
HAVEN: It's only money. I've changed my mind since I left here awhile ago. I don't want to pick a fight or break the bank What changed your mind?
CHARLIE: ( evenly ) What changed your mind?
HAVEN: ( grins ) That's what I came back to find out.
CHARLIE: Maybe it would be better if you found another girl.
HAVEN: ( smiling ) No, it wouldn't. I looked.
HAVEN: That man in ape's clothing could he be Charlie?
CHARLIE: His eyes follow you around like a couple of flies.
HAVEN: His eyes follow you around like a couple of flies.
CHARLIE: They follow me to see that strangers don't annoy me.
HAVEN: Only strangers?
CHARLIE: No one else would be so foolish.
HAVEN: First, you're beautiful. Then I like the way you sing and now you're a woman of mystery.
HAVEN: I don't want to be a stranger, so I'll have to be foolish.
CHARLIE: You like to take chances, don't you?
HAVEN: If I feel lucky.
CHARLIE: Then I'd advise you to try the dice I'd rather get lucky here.
HAVEN: I'd rather get lucky here.
CHARLIE: ( shrugging ) Every man has a right to go to his own funeral.
HAVEN: ( as the waiter sets down the champagne and glasses ) I could be your cousin from Waxahatchio. I could be cousin John, a missionary on his way to China.
HAVEN: He seems to be a lot of man.
CHARLIE: The most in town.
HAVEN: It's a very small town. You could get it all in this saloon.
CHARLIE: We usually do.
HAVEN: So Charlie probably runs the town.
PRINCE: ( toying with his dice ) Why do you care?
HAVEN: I'm going to spend some time here. I want to know who winds the clock.
CHARLIE: It's been a nice conversation. I hate to have it end.
MICK: Who's this?
CHARLIE: ( after a taut pause ) Mick this is cousin John.
HAVEN: ( relieved ) From Waxahatchie.
MICK: What's keeping him?
PRINCE: I think he's wondering if he couldn't do more good here. You aren't very friendly, are you, A friend to all is a friend to none.
MICK: You aren't very friendly, are you, A friend to all is a friend to none.
HAVEN: ( quoting ) A friend to all is a friend to none.
PRINCE: You ought to learn not to pick 'em so easy, like you do your cousins.
HAVEN: ( indicating Charlie ) Ask her?
CHARLIE: ( coolly ) I never saw him before in my life.
MICK: ( icily ) You're too little to make that big a You want to correct me or just bleed at the mouth?
HAVEN: You want to correct me or just bleed at the mouth?
MICK: ( coldly ) Bring him outside.
BRISTOW: What happened?
CHARLIE: ( casually ) A misunderstanding.
PRINCE: Did you find out what he wants?
CHARLIE: ( starting out ) He wanted to be my cousin. ( they follow her ) Only I haven't any aunts or uncles. ( still casually ) But you never know and the least I can do is bury him.
BRISTOW: Mick will kill him.
CHARLIE: That's ten to one.
BRISTOW: ( grinning ) I don't like the other fellow's chances, but I'm a sucker for odds.
CHARLIE: You should always bet on a champion. Then you can only lose once.
BRISTOW: You give ten to one.? I'll take it.
CHARLIE: You're down. A thousand to a hundred.
HAVEN: Don't miss so much. You'll got tired.
BRISTOW: He can fight a little.
CHARLIE: A little won't be enough.
MICK: Stand still and fight.
MICK: ( getting up very slow ) You can't do this.
MICK: ( in the dirt ) Nobody can do this. to me.
BOUNCER: Somebody just did.
BRISTOW: I can't believe it. Mick Marion losing a fight and me winning a thousand!
CHARLIE: ( to Prince ) Give it to him, Prince in chips.
ORVILLE: Have some coffee?
HAVEN: ( leaning on the desk )
ORVILLE: ( turning back to pick up a pitcher and a bottle ) They told me who was fightin'. I was getting ready to rent your room. Cream or sugar?
HAVEN: Orville pours the "cream" from a whiskey bottle. Haven sips He finishes the coffee, turns and starts for his room. Orville tosses two towels on Haven's shoulder as the latter goes. Strumming the guitar again softly, he watches with admiration the retreating form of Haven.
ORVILLE: ( looking with mild curiosity and admiration ) Myself, I'd rather fight a forest ( softly ) So would I.
HAVEN: ( softly ) So would I.
CHARLIE: How do you feel?
HAVEN: Like a million dollars.
CHARLIE: You just cost me a thousand. You lost your pipe in the fight. I brought it to you.
HAVEN: Do you always get sweet with the men who fight over you?
CHARLIE: Only the winners. Tell me something
HAVEN: Tell me something
CHARLIE: ( quietly, smiling ) ( he lies back ) That fellow might have killed me ( sleepily ) Where do you bury the losers?
HAVEN: ( he lies back ) That fellow might have killed me ( sleepily ) Where do you bury the losers?
CHARLIE: You talk too much.
HAVEN: ( bitterly ) What do you want the next dance?
CHARLIE: I think you'd better sit this one
FADE OUT: FADE IN INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY Haven comes to the desk from his room. Orville is singing another verse of the ballad. The clerk favors Haven with an admiring smile. The coffee pot is there.
FADE IN: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY Haven comes to the desk from his room. Orville is singing another verse of the ballad. The clerk favors Haven with an admiring smile. The coffee pot is there.
ORVILLE: Have some coffee?
HAVEN: Orville strums the strings as Haven drinks, having a little trouble with his sore hands.
HAVEN: The way you run this dump I knew you must be good at something else.
ORVILLE: Some call me the town poet and some the village idiot. Who am I to question either? How you feel today?
HAVEN: Like I crawled here from Kansas City.
ORVILLE: Well, it figures to make you pretty famous. Fact, people been askin' for you already.
HAVEN: That gold mine lady Mrs. Caslon.
ORVILLE: That gold mine lady Mrs. Caslon.
HAVEN: That's nice.
ORVILLE: Couldn't do better. And Charlie.
HAVEN: No. less.
ORVILLE: No. less.
HAVEN: You seem impressed.
ORVILLE: Why not? Charlie owns a piece of everything, includin' the undertaker and the sheriff.
HAVEN: The stage line too?
ORVILLE: Everything but the Wednesday Bible Class. Even owns a piece of me. Takes your money while you're here, and makes you pay to leave.
HAVEN: ( putting down the cup ) When you get the next verse I'd like to hear it.
ORVILLE: Can't find no word to rhyme with Mick Marion.
HAVEN: ( as he turns away )
DISSOLVE: INT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN Iles is pacing the floor. Mrs. Caslon is occupied with some minor domestic chore. Stellman is standing by the door. Iles is a ball of fire.
ILES: Of all the stupid bonehead plays! What did he fight about don't tell me a woman?
STELLMAN: That's what they tell me.
ILES: Who started it?
STELLMAN: I don't know, but Haven finished it.
ILES: That probably strikes you as a very admirable thing.
ILES: Well, I don't think so! I have men who can use their fists. Why didn't they send a man who could use his
ILES: Well open it up!
HAVEN: Hello, Mrs. Caslon.
HAVEN: Captain. Lieutenant.
ILES: ( coldly ) Mr. Haven, we may not have very much around here that pleases you, but we do have a strict post regulation against brawling in the town. Now would you like to explain what happened last night?
HAVEN: ( smiling ) I came here to return Mrs. Caslon's
ILES: ( indicating a chair ) Sit down.
ILES: This book I have in my hand is the Army Register, 1882.
ILES: I am now going to read from it. "Haven, John Martin, born Ohio 1852. Appointed Second Lieutenant. Promoted First Lieutenant 20th Infantry, March 1880; reduced in rank to 2nd Lieutenant January 12, 1881."
ILES: Is that correct?
HAVEN: It's the Army Register.
ILES: Haven, you've lost your rank once. It may very well happen again.
HAVEN: To almost anybody.
MRS. CASLON: Maybe if you'd let him explain. He might have a good reason.
ILES: Even a bad reason would delight me.
HAVEN: What would you like to know?
ILES: Did you pick that fight?
HAVEN: Those things can become very vague.
ILES: ( shrewdly ) And where do you expect all this to get you?
HAVEN: ( rising wearily ) That is a question I prefer not to ( snaps it ) I think you're trying to carry your authority too far.
ILES: ( snaps it ) I think you're trying to carry your authority too far.
HAVEN: Perhaps, but there's one thing, Captain Iles. We had an arrangement that we wouldn't meet you and I except through Mrs. Caslon. I think it's important to keep it that way. And I like it better.
DISSOLVE: INT. SALOON - DAY Business is slack. Girls drink coffee and knit at a table. Ernie polishes glasses at the bar. A colored man cleans a crap table. All look up with curiosity and esteem as Haven enters; all but Sam, the piano player, who goes on playing. Haven goes to the bar. Ernie nods at him.
HAVEN: Doesn't he ever stop playing?
ERNIE: Sam? It don't bother him. He's deaf.
HAVEN: Where do I find the boss?
ERNIE: First door top of the stairs.
HAVEN: Mick been around?
ERNIE: He's undisposed.
PRINCE'S VOICE: Come in.
HAVEN: ( to Prince ) You wanted to see me?
CHARLIE: I did.
HAVEN: They said Charlie
CHARLIE: She seems to enjoy Haven's momentary confusion. Prince is
HAVEN: You're Charlie?
CHARLIE: That's right. This is Prince. Don't ever gamble with him.
HAVEN: You mean with his equipment?
PRINCE: She means either. See you later, Charlie.
HAVEN: You surround yourself with very affable characters.
CHARLIE: It makes me feel at home.
HAVEN: You're not that sinister. Last night with the wet towels you were Florence Nightingale in silk stockings. Have you got a match?
HAVEN: There's one in my pocket but I hate to reach for it. thanks.
CHARLIE: Sit there.
HAVEN: ( smiles ) Now you're Florence Nightingale again.
CHARLIE: Why did you pick that fight?
HAVEN: I thought you did.
CHARLIE: ( smiling ) You could have insisted I was your Perhaps that isn't the way I felt about you.
HAVEN: You could have insisted I was your Perhaps that isn't the way I felt about you.
CHARLIE: Perhaps that isn't the way I felt about you.
HAVEN: ( as his knuckle hurts )
HAVEN: Where did you get the name of Charlie?
CHARLIE: It was my father's. My name is Charlene, but
HAVEN: I like that better. Charlene. This'll be the first time I ever worked for a woman.
CHARLIE: ( giving him a glance ) What makes you think you're going to work for me?
HAVEN: You sent for me.
CHARLIE: ( finishing the bandage ) How's that? ( walking towards the window ) All right, I sent for you. I was doing a nice quiet business. That was because everybody was afraid of Mick. Now every time a man has enough drinks in him to feel rugged he'll try to do what you did.
HAVEN: ( walking towards the window ) All right, I sent for you. I was doing a nice quiet business. That was because everybody was afraid of Mick. Now every time a man has enough drinks in him to feel rugged he'll try to do what you did.

HAVEN: I wouldn't.
CHARLIE: But they will.
HAVEN: That's not the job I want. I don't intend to start at the bottom. I've been there. It's too crowded.
CHARLIE: ( coolly ) Where do you want to start?
HAVEN: With the money.
CHARLIE: And what will you do for it?
HAVEN: Anything except hang. How did you get all this?
CHARLIE: I learned one thing from my father. As long as men think they can beat the tables, all you have to do is get a table. Sometimes they run out of cash and I find myself with new Such as
HAVEN: Such as
CHARLIE: A couple of stores for one thing.
HAVEN: I can't see myself behind a counter.
CHARLIE: A sawmill, and a logging camp. The logging camp's a long way from town.
CHARLIE: I own the stage line from here to West Rim City, but that's a dud.
HAVEN: Outlaws. The money was in gold shipments. Now the mines won't ship I'll take that job.
CHARLIE: Outlaws. The money was in gold shipments. Now the mines won't ship I'll take that job.
HAVEN: I'll take that job.
CHARLIE: You mean ride shot-gun?
HAVEN: I mean run the line.
CHARLIE: Don't force your luck. You won a fight last night. You could lose one Today I'd hate to tangle with a What do you think you'll get out of running the stage line?
HAVEN: Today I'd hate to tangle with a What do you think you'll get out of running the stage line?
CHARLIE: What do you think you'll get out of running the stage line?
HAVEN: A commission on all the gold I get That should buy you a small beer.
CHARLIE: That should buy you a small beer.
HAVEN: Glad to get it.
CHARLIE: It's pretty dangerous. Even Wells Fargo locked up their station and quit trying.
HAVEN: ( leveling ) Who steals the gold?
CHARLIE: Who doesn't? All they have to do is put a mask on and they all look like Black Bart.
HAVEN: ( rising ) Give me a letter of authorization.
CHARLIE: ( going to the desk ) I can't bet against you twice, can
I?: As she writes out the authorization, Haven saunters to the window, then over to the desk. Charlie finishes and hands him the paper. Haven scans it, pockets it.
CHARLIE: ( smiling at him ) You know I forgot to ask you one I'm working for you now. You can ask me anything.
HAVEN: I'm working for you now. You can ask me anything.
CHARLIE: How do I know I can trust you?
HAVEN: You don't.
CHARLIE: Can I?
HAVEN: Only with money.
HAVEN: ( quietly ) Okay, boss?
DISSOLVE: EXT. STAGE LINE DEPOT - DAY As Haven walks through the wide gate into a compound. There are several unhitched stages and freight wagons, one or two in partial disassembly and being serviced. A colored boy is readying a horse and buggy and beside him, overlooking the yard activities, is a bespectacled man with rubber sleeve garters. He is the manager. He has eyes like Armadillo and claw-like hands; otherwise, he could be your loan agency man. Seeing Haven he crosses to him.
HAVEN: ( looking him over ) Are you the manager?
MANAGER: I am.
HAVEN: My name's Haven.
MANAGER: I've heard about you. You're the fellah who took Mick Marion apart. Almost knocked me off my feet. But my feet ain't been any good since I followed Stonewall Jackson. What business you got with me?
HAVEN: ( handing him the note ) I'm the new boss.
HAVEN: Wait a minute. You're not fired.
MANAGER: I got to be. There ain't enough work around here for one man, let alone Two can loaf as easy as one.
HAVEN: Two can loaf as easy as one.
JERRY: Mr. Leonard! Talk to him. He just took the reins. This is Jim Goddard. He's a regular stage driver. Jerry here runs freight to the sawmill. Boys, your new boss.
MANAGER: Talk to him. He just took the reins. This is Jim Goddard. He's a regular stage driver. Jerry here runs freight to the sawmill. Boys, your new boss.
HAVEN: Hello, boys.
JERRY: ( with a grin of hero worship ) I gotta start out of here for the sawmill before daybreak. Is that all right, Mr. Haven?
JERRY: I seen that fight last night. It was sure a beauty.
HAVEN: Glad you enjoyed it.
JERRY: What I liked was the way you
HAVEN: Let's not talk about it. Right now it hurts my hands to listen.
JERRY: Yes, sir.
HAVEN: What happened to you?
GODDARD: My last run. I stopped a bullet.
HAVEN: Did you get a look at them?
GODDARD: I wish I had.
HAVEN: I think I'm going to need you and not on one leg. So sit down and give it a rest.
GODDARD: ( slowly smiling ) Yes, sir.
HAVEN: I'm coming back later and sit behind your desk. I'll need the keys.
MANAGER: ( taking keys from his pocket ) Only things here that work.
MANAGER: Son, I waste my time. I might as well waste some advice. You're full of blood and vinegar, but this whole thing has got something wrong with it. Goddard only got nicked in the shin. You might not be so lucky.
HAVEN: I might depend on something besides Like for instance?
MANAGER: Like for instance?
HAVEN: Well the fact that they don't seem to shoot too straight.
MANAGER: They don't need to when they shoot so often.

COLORED BOY: I shouldn't let you do this, suh. But ah am.
DISSOLVE: INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAY Charlie is dressed to go somewhere. She looks much nicer in these clothes than in her show garments of the night. She is listening to Prince who sits in a chair, the inevitable dice in his fingers, two this time. There is a silence except the rattle of the cubes. Then Prince speaks coldly.
PRINCE: Does this Haven move me out? Is that the plan?
CHARLIE: Prince, you know I wouldn't part with you.
PRINCE: But I always come up empty.
CHARLIE: Not quite empty. I gave you what is probably the one honest feeling you ever had in your life.
PRINCE: I keep forgetting that. Pardon me.
CHARLIE: What's the matter, Prince?
PRINCE: I don't like John Haven or anything about him.
CHARLIE: You've said that.
PRINCE: What do you know about him?
CHARLIE: You want me to have him looked up in the Social Register?
PRINCE: A man walks in out of nowhere
CHARLIE: ( turning ) And went against your table. Did he play like a gambler?
PRINCE: He knew something.
CHARLIE: Yes and he took Mick.
PRINCE: So he can fight. You like that part, don't you? I'll tell you one thing, Prince, I don't like this part.
CHARLIE: I'll tell you one thing, Prince, I don't like this part.
HAVEN: Stand there a second.
HAVEN: Every time I see you, you look different, but you always look beautiful. Why is that?
CHARLIE: I always have somebody to lie to me.
HAVEN: Take my hand But don't squeeze it.
CHARLIE: Tell me what you're doing with my My work. I'm the new transportation boss. You hired me.
HAVEN: My work. I'm the new transportation boss. You hired me.
HAVEN: I presume you're going shopping?
CHARLIE: I wouldn't wear anything sold this side of Chicago. I'm going to call on a gentleman.
HAVEN: At this hour?
CHARLIE: His name is Mark Bristow and any hour, it would be strictly business.
HAVEN: The way you say it he may need a He's a lawyer himself, but it won't help him.
CHARLIE: He's a lawyer himself, but it won't help him.
HAVEN: ( with a smile ) What good is a lawyer if he never gets in a court?
CHARLIE: ( with a smile ) What good is a lawyer if he never gets in a court?
HAVEN: Like a doctor in a graveyard. Where is this unlucky man?
CHARLIE: Across the street.
HAVEN: Shall I take the horses back and rub them down?
CHARLIE: Do you think they've gone far enough?
HAVEN: I haven't.
CHARLIE: Then maybe you better wait and come with me.
HAVEN: I wonder if you'd do me a favor?
MRS. CASLON: Why, surely.
HAVEN: It's a big favor, and I wouldn't blame you if you refused.
MRS. CASLON: What is it?
HAVEN: I want to haul some gold from your That IS a big favor.
MRS. CASLON: That IS a big favor.
HAVEN: I know it seems impossible to you, but that's one reason why I'm here to find cut what makes it impossible.
MRS. CASLON: Isn't that very risky?
HAVEN: That's why I couldn't go to anyone but you.
MRS. CASLON: ( hesitating ) I'm just wondering if we shouldn't speak to Captain Iles first.
HAVEN: You know what he'd say. He'd advise against it but if it works my way, it may clear everything up for all of us and for Iles too. The War Department doesn't like all that gold around an Army Post.
HAVEN: ( softly ) We're working too much in the dark. This may be the only way to see something. It's a risk but someone has to take it.
MRS. CASLON: ( firmly ) Who else will know of it?
HAVEN: Just us. That'll be all who know and that's the idea.
MRS. CASLON: ( simply ) I'll arrange it.
HAVEN: ( grinning ) Don't look so grim. It's only your gold and my skin. And smile when you walk away as though we'd been talking about what a dry summer it's been.
BRISTOW: .You know I'll always cooperate as much as possible. But I haven't the money.
CHARLIE: ( rising and going to the desk with a sheaf of papers, which she places on his desk ) These are I.O.U.s for gambling. They add up to six thousand dollars. Do you want to count them?
BRISTOW: ( returning them to her pocket ) Your credit's over, Mark.
CHARLIE: ( returning them to her pocket ) Your credit's over, Mark.
BRISTOW: My luck can turn, can't it?
CHARLIE: Not on my tables.
BRISTOW: I've seen other people fall in this trap but I didn't think it would get me.
CHARLIE: Nobody does. I'll have Prince drop in and go over your books. Maybe we can work something out.
BRISTOW: But I told you
CHARLIE: That's the way it is, Mark. I pay off on the line and I expect to get paid. Give it some thought.
WIPE: INT. CHARLIE'S CARRIAGE - DAY As Charlie and Haven drive in the country. The road winds between hills now and a stream tumbles along beside the winding road. The horse is moving at a snail's pace and Charlie is gazing around at the scenery, relaxed and
HAVEN: You know, you remind me a little back there of a character I once read in a book.
CHARLIE: I had an idea you'd read a book. What was the character?
HAVEN: Simon Legree.
CHARLIE: Mark is mixed up. He's either crooked without being smart, or honest without being lucky. And that's no good.
HAVEN: I don't think I'd want to owe you money even if I was honest.
CHARLIE: When I was seven I robbed my own piggy bank.
HAVEN: When I was seven I robbed my own piggy bank.
CHARLIE: It's hard to imagine you being seven.
HAVEN: I was very fat and ate a lot of candy.
CHARLIE: Is that why you robbed your bank?

CHARLIE: Did you do it?
HAVEN: Yeah, but I had to go back.

HAVEN: The rook here and the stream. The stream is always running away and the rock is always watching it go. It's two ways to be and I always wonder which is the best.
CHARLIE: The rook here and the stream. The stream is always running away and the rock is always watching it go. It's two ways to be and I always wonder which is the best.
HAVEN: They probably envy each other.
CHARLIE: Do you suppose any woman could envy I know it.
HAVEN: I know it.
CHARLIE: But not a good woman?
HAVEN: Nobody is any good. You mean Respectable people are very useful but they bore me.
CHARLIE: Respectable people are very useful but they bore me.
HAVEN: Respectable people are very useful but they bore me.
CHARLIE: With certain exceptions.
HAVEN: ( curiously ) Like who?
CHARLIE: Like Mary Caslon.
HAVEN: I thought we might get to that.
CHARLIE: How did you happen to know her?
HAVEN: I knew her husband.
CHARLIE: That's curious, considering
HAVEN: Considering what?
CHARLIE: Ben Caslon was a very upright citizen.
HAVEN: Meaning I'm not?
CHARLIE: ( adds thoughtfully ) She's certainly not hard to look at and now she has the money and is ( looking away ) also very respectable.
HAVEN: Then why would she be interested in Because you're no good. And good women like men who are bad for them.
CHARLIE: Because you're no good. And good women like men who are bad for them.
HAVEN: Flattery will get you nowhere.
CHARLIE: Fooling with her will get you nowhere too except in trouble.
HAVEN: With whom?
CHARLIE: The army. Why is it you're always getting mixed up with the army?
HAVEN: ( idly ) What are the odds I hit the leaf?
CHARLIE: ( absently ) Four to one.

CHARLIE: She's engaged to Captain Iles.
HAVEN: He's the army boss here.
CHARLIE: He's the army boss here.
HAVEN: ( smiling ) If you're going to frighten me, the least you can do is hold my hand.
HAVEN: This is where you ought to slip and I should catch you and kiss you.
CHARLIE: No chance.

HAVEN: ( taking out his pipe ) When can you get my things back to the hotel, Charlie?
CHARLIE: Why don't you take them yourself?

CHARLIE: You're really hard aren't you?
HAVEN: You have to play everything alone?

CAMERA PANS OVER TO Haven, on horseback, as he studies the scene. This is where he evidently made camp for the night. He dismounts, sifts the ashes through his fingers to feel their warmth. He cannot be far behind. Then he turns his attention to the trail loading away. Inspection reveals that it divides, one group of fresh tracks heading towards town, another smaller group further into the mountains. He decides to follow the latter. As he mounts and rides off:

DISSOLVE: EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY This is deserted country on the way to town. When the land slopes steeply from the road down into a kind of wash, Haven halts the wagon. He glances around. No sign of life. He takes a hammer and chisel out of the tool box beside the seat, crawls to the crate and prys it open. His cargo is gold. Satisfied, he replaces the pried board, then pushes the crate over the side. It topples down the bank, vanishes in the brush at the bottom of the wash. With one more glance around, Haven resumes his seat in the wagon, puts a match to his pipe, and sends the horses forward at a faster clip.

ILES: Who do you think I represent?
MRS. CASLON: I told you, George, I was only trying to help you.
ILES: ( containing his fury ) And while we're on the subject, who does Mark Bristow represent?
MRS. CASLON: You know perfectly well that he's my I know perfectly well he's a scoundrel Is he also trying to help me?
ILES: I know perfectly well he's a scoundrel Is he also trying to help me?
ILES: ( at the door, a ball of cold fire ) Thank you, Mary.
ILES: I'm sorry. I'd say that I lost my head if I believed that I had one.
MRS. CASLON: ( kissing him fondly ) It's my fault George. ( turning ) Mark left me something.
MRS. CASLON: You're not going to open it?
ILES: To whom it may concern. That's what it says here. Well, it may concern me.
ILES: It does.
ILES: ( grimly ) My business isn't jammed up enough so they send this harebrained demoted lieutenant pry around in it. They want to help me too.
MRS. CASLON: George you're getting to be a hard man to deal with.
ILES: I'm getting to deal with some hard
DISSOLVE: You certainly are a careful man.
BRISTOW: You certainly are a careful man.
HAVEN: I have to be. I live a careless life.
HAVEN: What about the deposition?
BRISTOW: She has it. It's in her safe.
HAVEN: What do we do now?
BRISTOW: What do we do now?
HAVEN: We call on Charlie.
BRISTOW: It's a dangerous play, Haven.
HAVEN: Is it?
BRISTOW: What if she doesn't believe you?
HAVEN: Then she'll have to believe you.
BRISTOW: That deposition could be a lie. It might not stand up in a court.
HAVEN: You're sure of that?
BRISTOW: Well not exactly.
HAVEN: That's it. You're a lawyer and you're not sure. Then how can she gamble on it, either?
BRISTOW: Because she's a gambler.
HAVEN: No, she isn't. We're the gamblers, Mark. Lot's go.
DISSOLVE: EXT. HOTEL - EVENING As Haven and Mark come out. They walk towards the saloon. People look at them curiously. Suddenly, down the street, the sheriff appears, approaching Haven slowly and ominously. Sensing a gun fight, people vanish. Purely from instinct, Mark deserts Haven's side in a hurried walk towards the saloon, eyeing both. Haven comes on leisurely. The sheriff has stopped in his tracks and has his gun out. A woman clutches her child to her skirt. Men stand stockstill, watching. A crowd forms at the entrance to Charlie's. Haven walks slowly forward until he reaches the waiting sheriff. He looks him over with a smile of contempt.
SHERIFF: You're under arrest!
HAVEN: ( pausing ) For what?
SHERIFF: For the murder of James Goddard and robbery under arms!
HAVEN: ( casually ) I've heard about you. You don't appear to understand the functions of your ( taking sheriff's gun and breaking it open ) You've missed the whole point of your profession. ( showing him ) Even your gun isn't loaded. ( Haven loads it as it goes on ) I suggest that you start all over again, with this point in mind: the duty of a peace officer is to arrest the culprit of a crime not the
DISSOLVE: INT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - NIGHT The place is roaring. Haven enters, followed by Mark. The guy at the piano is playing as always. Haven and Mark go slowly to the bar, eyes following them. The noise softens almost to silence, except the piano, Cowering, Mark sticks close to Haven. At the dice table, Prince stares coldly, hands another man the stick and walks away to the stairway, his eyes seeking Mick Marion who is also staring at Haven. Prince nods to Mick as he goes. MED. SHOT at bar as Haven and Mark loan against it. Ernie is looking at him curiously; then towards Mick. Haven doesn't follow the glance, but Mark does.
ERNIE: Ernie gets them. Haven glances at the piano. Mick who had stood there has now vanished. Haven smiles. The drinks arrive.
HAVEN: Ernie gets them. Haven glances at the piano. Mick who had stood there has now vanished. Haven smiles. The drinks arrive.
BRISTOW: ( gulping his drink ) This is no good.
HAVEN: The bourbon is just as bad.
BRISTOW: I don't mean that.
HAVEN: You want to leave?
BRISTOW: I just don't like it. I'm a nervous man. Something's going to happen. I can feel it.
HAVEN: That's right.
BRISTOW: Then why don't we do something.
HAVEN: We're doing something.
BRISTOW: Waiting for something to happen. Charlie wants to see you. Upstairs.
HAVEN: Waiting for something to happen. Charlie wants to see you. Upstairs.
STICKMAN: Charlie wants to see you. Upstairs.
HAVEN: ( to Mark )
BRISTOW: Do I go with you?
HAVEN: Can you make it?
HAVEN: I see you found the difference.
HAVEN: Looks like a board meeting.
CHARLIE: ( indicating Mark ) What's he doing with you?
HAVEN: I thought I might need a lawyer.
CHARLIE: I doubt it.
HAVEN: I can realize how seldom legal technicalities annoy you but I have one that might. Besides, he knows all about it.
PRINCE: About what?
HAVEN: About a gear box I failed to deliver.
BRISTOW: I don't know anything! I merely
PRINCE: Shut up!
HAVEN: ( quietly ) Mark is right. He doesn't know anything. He just knows what I dictated to him in a deposition.
CHARLIE: And what was that?
HAVEN: It was just a story. About a man who got murdered, a thief who got shot, and a gear box that got lost. Probably nobody would believe it .unless I got killed for it.
CHARLIE: Go downstairs, Pete. Watch the
CHARLIE: ( to Haven ) Who else have you told?
HAVEN: No one. Mark I had to have. He's a witness and a notary. He makes it stick. He stands it up in court.
CHARLIE: ( always watching his face ) What keeps it from getting to a court?
HAVEN: A cut.
MICK: He's running a bluff!
HAVEN: I ran one on you.
CHARLIE: You brought your lawyer. Ask him if this doesn't sound like blackmail.
HAVEN: He can't think very clearly in the presence of a gun.
PRINCE: But it doesn't bother you?
HAVEN: ( coldly ) No, it doesn't.
PRINCE: What you want is money.
CHARLIE: I don't see how going to the law will get it for you.
HAVEN: If you did see how, I'd never get there, would I?
CHARLIE: I'm afraid not.
HAVEN: So it boils down to this: we can make a deal, and all be happy Not as long as you always have something on us.
PRINCE: Not as long as you always have something on us.
HAVEN: Unless you also have something on And how would that be?
CHARLIE: And how would that be?
HAVEN: When I deliver the gold to you.
CHARLIE: You mean the gear box?
HAVEN: I can even forget I looked inside. So I stole a gear box. I'm still a
PRINCE: ( indicating Mark ) What does he get?
HAVEN: He gets even with you.
PRINCE: Have you lost your mind!
HAVEN: It was all right when he lost his All right. I'll give him the IOU's. when the gear box is You don't realize how important it is when a piece of machinery breaks down. It could close the entire I guess I didn't realize it.
CHARLIE: All right. I'll give him the IOU's. when the gear box is You don't realize how important it is when a piece of machinery breaks down. It could close the entire I guess I didn't realize it.
PRINCE: ( smiling ) You don't realize how important it is when a piece of machinery breaks down. It could close the entire I guess I didn't realize it.
HAVEN: I guess I didn't realize it.
CHARLIE: I think that's all.
CHARLIE: ( to Haven ) You can stay.
HAVEN: ( to Prince ) I think she was talking to me.
PRINCE: You roll nice dice and you bet them jamb up, but some day you'll slip. And when you do, I'll be around to catch you.
HAVEN: You know, I think he will.
CHARLIE: Then you should be more careful.
HAVEN: The poorhouses are filled with careful .And so are the graveyards.
HAVEN: You've got a nice perfume.
CHARLIE: ( she ruffles his hair with her hand ) I almost had to have you killed. I'd have hated it.
HAVEN: So would I.
CHARLIE: I'd have missed you. too much.
HAVEN: And too long.
CHARLIE: ( she smiles at him ) Did you ever tell a woman you loved All of them.
HAVEN: All of them.
CHARLIE: How did you get away?
HAVEN: I was always in the doorway when I said it.
CHARLIE: You never said it to me.
HAVEN: Let's go over to the doorway.
CHARLIE: I seem to always end up like this with you. I take you for granted. You like it that way. It goes with loaded dice and crimped cards and fixed wheels.
HAVEN: Isn't that your business.
CHARLIE: It isn't my life.
CHARLIE: You told me once you might be a missionary on your way to China. And that's as much as I've ever found out about you. You're working for me, but for all I know you could be working for somebody else.
HAVEN: Like Goddard?
CHARLIE: Why not?
HAVEN: I think I better bring you that gold.
STELLMAN: Haven looks at him. Charlie watches.
HAVEN: Don't tell me you're still recruiting?
STELLMAN: Yes, we still want you. But this is a little different.
HAVEN: And how's that?
STELLMAN: Captain Iles has asked me to take you into custody, Haven.
CHARLIE: ( quietly ) You heard the man.
STELLMAN: Best thing for you is to come along, That's what I like the best thing for me.
HAVEN: That's what I like the best thing for me.
PRINCE: Very friendly with everybody isn't he? Wells Fargo detectives, and now the Army. How far can he go?
CHARLIE: Exactly where he's headed now to
DISSOLVE: Note: Pick up two night exteriors of the post.
SERGEANT: ( to Iles ) The Quartermaster at Platte wants three sworn statements before he'll replace those seventy uniforms, sir.
ILES: Three sworn statements! I told him all I know. They were in the freight office at West Rim City. The building burned down.. .you sure he doesn't want me to send him the ashes too? All right, have Stamm fix the papers. Come in. Nice to see you alive.
ILES: ( pleasantly ) Come in. Nice to see you alive.
ILES: Nice to see you alive.
HAVEN: Dumb luck.
ILES: You seem to have been living quite an adventurous life.
HAVEN: Is that why I'm under arrest?
ILES: That's indefinite. I wanted to talk to you.
HAVEN: If you consult the Army Blue Book it might enable you to be more definite.
ILES: ( grimly ) Curiously enough, you got me into the habit of reading myself. You're quite right about The Blue Book ( fiercely ) UNLESS that officer should get himself about one-half as far out of line as you have!
HAVEN: How far is that?
ILES: Right here in your own statement!
HAVEN: I see you did what I expected.
ILES: You've gotten a man killed and Mrs. Caslon's gold stolen. Is that far Not quite.
HAVEN: Not quite.
ILES: ( rising slowly ) Haven as far as I'm concerned, this deposition is good enough for ( indicates the deposition ) I want these people arrested. This is all the evidence we need.
HAVEN: I need more.
ILES: For what reason?
HAVEN: For the reason I came here. to get the murderers of two soldiers not to save somebody's gold. That's a mistake you made. I still don't know who killed them, but I'm going to find out. And when the net is hauled in, they're all going to be in it. That's my fish and you can have the minnows.
ILES: ( demandingly ) When are you returning Mrs. Caslon's ( firmly ) That's a matter between myself and Mrs. Caslon.
HAVEN: ( firmly ) That's a matter between myself and Mrs. Caslon.
ILES: I don't particularly like you but I see no reason why you should get yourself deliberately killed.
HAVEN: ( smiling again ) It won't be deliberate.
ILES: What difference does it make how you get killed? Where does it leave me?
HAVEN: Where does it leave me?
ILES: ( meaning it ) Understand this, Haven. You're heading for bad trouble and when it comes don't expect any help from me. Is that clear?
HAVEN: ( smiling thinly ) From the beginning. Anything else, Sir?
STELLMAN: Anything else, Sir?
ILES: ( glumly ) Yes, three cigars, a pint of whiskey, and a copy of that confounded Blue
DISSOLVE: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT As Haven saunters in. Orville is, as always, behind the desk. Haven nods at him.
HAVEN: What's the good word?
ORVILLE: For you it's not good. You're in bad I don't know how you can know so much and move so little. I think I'll try it myself.
HAVEN: I don't know how you can know so much and move so little. I think I'll try it myself.
ORVILLE: Want to leave a call?
HAVEN: That's very nice of you.
ORVILLE: What time?
HAVEN: When you're sure everybody in town is in bed call me. And if anybody asks for me I went to jail.
FADE OUT: FADE IN EXT. COUNTRY - DAY Haven, driving a wagon and team of horses, is retracing the road he took back from the sawmill looking for the place where he dumped the bullion. CLOSER VIEW of Haven, as he looks for the landmarks. He is whistling softly the tune that Charlie always sings. At last he stops, alights and makes his way down the steep slope, a couple of gunny sacks slung across his shoulder. Bottom of the gulley as Haven gets there and locates the crate at rest in a clump of brush. The crate has broken from the fall. Haven loads the buckskin bags of gold into the gunny sack and scrambles back up the slope. Side of slope as Haven scrambles to the top, he finds himself looking into a six-shooter held in the unwavering hand of Mrs. Caslon. Her eyes are hard and a grim smile plays at the corners of her mouth.

MRS. CASLON: Drop it.
MRS. CASLON: Turn around with your hands up.
MRS. CASLON: All right put it in the wagon.
HAVEN: Is this a hold-up?
MRS. CASLON: You want to put it in the wagon?
HAVEN: ( looking at her hard eyes )
MRS. CASLON: Now was there something you wanted to say?
HAVEN: I trailed one of the bandits here where they cached it. I couldn't haul it on horseback, so I came here with the wagon.
MRS. CASLON: I know that's a lie.
HAVEN: Some of it's true.
MRS. CASLON: But not nearly enough.
HAVEN: I'll try it again. I cached it here myself. I was going to turn it over to them. I wanted to buy a membership in their club. This was the initiation Fifty thousand dollars?
MRS. CASLON: Fifty thousand dollars?
HAVEN: Well, you see, I thought it was worth Well, you see, I don't.
MRS. CASLON: Well, you see, I don't.
HAVEN: ( quietly ) What you're doing may get me into serious trouble.
MRS. CASLON: If you're still in town in twenty- four hours, I promise what I do may get you hanged.
DISSOLVE: INT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - DAY As Haven enters. He is dusty and tired from his long walk. The place is moderately busy. MED. SHOT of Haven as he sits tiredly at a table where Charlie and Prince are sitting. She smiles at him.
CHARLIE: I thought you were in jail.
HAVEN: I talked my way out.
CHARLIE: You're a very glib man. You seem to talk your way out of everything.
HAVEN: Up to a certain point.
CHARLIE: What's that?
HAVEN: A gun.
PRINCE: Are we celebrating something?
HAVEN: ( to Charlie ) You know, the first time I talked to you we had champagne. ( smiling at her ) I think I should have been a missionary and gone to China after
CHARLIE: Didn't you bring me something?
HAVEN: But you will?
CHARLIE: But you will?
HAVEN: Her face changes; hardens. She glances across at Prince. Haven watches Prince with a smile.
PRINCE: ( quietly ) No just like that?
HAVEN: It's easy to explain. It's just a little hard to believe.
CHARLIE: Make it as credible as you can.
HAVEN: ( smiling grimly ) I can't. ( filling the pipe ) I went to get it, and it was there. But so was somebody else.
CHARLIE: Mrs. Caslon.
HAVEN: Mrs. Caslon.
CHARLIE: No. she had a gun with her.
HAVEN: No. she had a gun with her.
PRINCE: Did you have one too?
HAVEN: The one she had was in her hand. This could be that slip you mentioned.
HAVEN: This could be that slip you mentioned.
CHARLIE: ( to Haven ) So this nice lady held you up and took the gold, is that it?
HAVEN: It's like saying I got robbed at Sunday school. It's no good, is it?
PRINCE: ( looking at him ) No, it isn't.
HAVEN: I even had to walk back to town. I think that may be one of the longest walks I ever took.
PRINCE: And one of the last.
PRINCE: Mick might have killed you, but you fought him with your fists. The sheriff had a gun but you took it away from him. Ben had a gun last night but it didn't seem to scare you. Now this genteol petticoat waves a pistol and you run for your life.
HAVEN: ( twirling the wineglass, glancing at Charlie ) He makes it sound very silly.
PRINCE: Or I make it sound like what it is: a lie!
PRINCE: Haven extracts the match, with a glance of contempt at Prince; then lights the pipe again.
HAVEN: ( smiling faintly ) My word doesn't seem very good around You've only got one thing left that's any good here - and that's some gold.
PRINCE: You've only got one thing left that's any good here - and that's some gold.
HAVEN: ( to Charlie ) Is that all I've got?
CHARLIE: Not quite. You've got some time. You've got two hours to get it here.
HAVEN: You want me to fatten you up before you kill me? Is that what you mean?
CHARLIE: I said what I meant two hours.
HAVEN: I once knew a guy who stole a dime tip from a lunch counter and parlayed it into fifty thousand. I might try that but not in two hours.
HAVEN: ( to Charlie ) You're sweet.
WIPE: EXT. STREET - DAY As Haven leaves the saloon. He pauses, looks around, up at the sky, then down the street. He takes out his pipe and beginning filling it slowly with tobacco, as Mark Bristow comes hurrying across the street. MOVING SHOT of Haven as he walks very slowly, filling the pipe, and Mark comes alongside and walks with him. Haven hardly glances at him.
BRISTOW: I've been looking for you. Where have you been?
HAVEN: I took a walk in the country.
BRISTOW: Did you get it for her?
HAVEN: ( pausing in front of the hotel )
BRISTOW: But that was the deal. You agreed to
BRISTOW: If you're trying to pull something
HAVEN: ( finished with the pipe ) You want to listen?
BRISTOW: ( calming himself ) All right.
HAVEN: ( explicitly ) I can't deliver it because I no longer have it. It was taken away from me by Mrs. Caslon. I've told Charlie, and she's very unhappy. I have two hours to produce the loot. You haven't any idea where a man could raise fifty thousand quickly, have you?
HAVEN: I thought not.
BRISTOW: What are you going to do.?
HAVEN: Nothing, Mark. The boat just sailed.
BRISTOW: What about me?
HAVEN: You'll have to think of something very good.
BRISTOW: I can think of something.
HAVEN: ( patting his shoulder with a slight smile ) Go ahead, Mark. Go ahead and do it.
WIPE: INT. HAVEN'S ROOM - DAY He enters, locks the door. Pulls the shade at the window, takes off his shoes and coat and lies down on the bed. He gazes towards the wall, thoughtfully. He gets up, goes to the window, opens it softly; then looks out. Down the alley, at the corner, a man is lounging; an ugly looking character, whose eyes watch the alleyway. Haven smiles wryly, goes back to the bed and lies down. The piano music starts next door.
CHARLIE: Everything ready?
PETE: All set.
PRINCE: Got enough men at the sawmill?
PETE: All right. Go back out there and get them into the uniforms. We'll hit the post just before midnight.
PRINCE: All right. Go back out there and get them into the uniforms. We'll hit the post just before midnight.
PRINCE: I don't know what we're waiting for.
CHARLIE: I gave him some time. He's in the hotel. He's not doing anything. I gave him some time. I don't care what he does with it.
MICK: And I don't care when, but I'll get
CHARLIE: Mick is silent. Charlie smiles thinly.
CHARLIE: Bristow's here.
PRINCE: This should be good.
CHARLIE: ( to Mick ) Let him in. You want the I.O.U's?
CHARLIE: You want the I.O.U's?
BRISTOW: You mean
BRISTOW: Why? Did Haven
PRINCE: No, he didn't.
BRISTOW: Then I don't understand
PRINCE: We don't think they're going to be any good.
BRISTOW: I didn't have anything to do with it. All I did was write it. I'm not in on this. I can still make them Or I can
CHARLIE: I can do business. I got it somewhere. I Here take a look at this the deposition The only copy.
BRISTOW: I can do business. I got it somewhere. I Here take a look at this the deposition The only copy.
CHARLIE: ( coldly ) Let's have it.
BRISTOW: ( eagerly )
PRINCE: What do you want?
BRISTOW: ( as Charlie opens the envelope ) Nothing. I just want to get out of it. I never had any part of it. This ought to prove that!
CHARLIE: She hands him the paper from the envelope. Marks takes it and stares at it. It is absolutely a blank piece of paper. He stands there, bites his lips. He looks wearily around at them, fear making him weak, making him unable to hold the piece of paper, so that it floats to the carpet.
BRISTOW: ( at last ) It's it's a trick. I ( trying to pull himself together ) I'll see about this! He can't do this to me! ( moving back towards the door ) I'll go and see about this!
CHARLIE: Sure, you see about it.
CHARLIE: Take this along. Something left to wait for?
PRINCE: Something left to wait for?
CHARLIE: ( slowly )
HAVEN: Who is it?
MARK'S VOICE: It's me Bristow let me in.
HAVEN: You going to shoot me, Mark?
BRISTOW: You double crossed me, Haven.
HAVEN: I did?
BRISTOW: I got the deposition back. I took it to them.
BRISTOW: It wasn't there! It was a piece of blank paper! Don't you laugh at me! I ought to kill you!
BRISTOW: Don't you laugh at me! I ought to kill you!
HAVEN: They want you to, Mark.
HAVEN: And it may be your only out, if you do. But I doubt it. You know why? Because even if you took them my scalp, it wouldn't buy your life. You're in debt and you're broke and you're scared and you know far too much. There isn't any way they use you alive. Can you think of
BRISTOW: They're going to do it. I know it. They're going to kill me Why do they have to kill me?
HAVEN: Us, Mark.
HAVEN: This must be hers.
BRISTOW: ( dully ) She's sweet.
HAVEN: She's sweet.
HAVEN: There's one thing, Mark.
BRISTOW: ( gulping the drink ) There is?
HAVEN: You might get out of town.
BRISTOW: There isn't a chance in a thousand.
HAVEN: If there's one in a million, it's the only one you have.
BRISTOW: Yes we might get away with it. We I'm not going.
HAVEN: I'm not going.
HAVEN: I have to stay.
BRISTOW: But you can't stay. You said yourself
HAVEN: If you must do this, go straight to your horse. Don't stop for anything.
BRISTOW: I've got a lot of important papers
HAVEN: You haven't got anything important left, Mark except your life, and very little time to keep it. You do it very fast and you might be lucky.
BRISTOW: ( trying to pull himself together ) Yes. I might be. I'll try it.
HAVEN: ( softly; turning to the clerk ) You didn't throw away that verse?
ORVILLE: You won't have to change it much.
HAVEN: You won't have to change it much.
ORVILLE: You ain't going out there with that?
HAVEN: Not much, is it?
ORVILLE: You'll never get closer to having No I won't.
HAVEN: ( staring out ) No I won't.
ORVILLE: I'm naturally sentimental, bein' a sort of poet.
HAVEN: I'm naturally sentimental, bein' a sort of poet.
ORVILLE: I'm naturally sentimental, bein' a sort of poet.
HAVEN: I keep a bunch of gimeracks an oldtime sheriff's gun, a bullet from a dead bandit, a rosary from some guy they hanged.
ORVILLE: I keep a bunch of gimeracks an oldtime sheriff's gun, a bullet from a dead bandit, a rosary from some guy they hanged.
HAVEN: That's nice. A hobby?
ORVILLE: In a way Want to leave me
HAVEN: This is all I seem to have.
ORVILLE: ( taking it ) Army button. ( puzzled ) Where's the uniform that goes with What do you want for ( he pauses as the idea hits him ) Yeh? A very good question.
HAVEN: What do you want for Yeh? A very good question.
HAVEN: I might even know. I think I'll try to go and find out.
SHERIFF: All right, you march.
HAVEN: You loaded your gun for this?
SHERIFF: No you did.
SHERIFF: Come on, you! Keep moving!
WIPE: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY As Haven slows down his horse, but goes on at a fair clip after looking warily back. He breaks open the sheriff's gun, finds it loaded. He reacts and whistles softly. As he swings his horse off the travelled road to head crosscountry for the sawmill.
FADE OUT: FADE IN EXT. NEAR SAWMILL - NIGHT As Haven sits on his horse at a point in the woods where he can look down on the sawmill. Around the mill office there seems to be signs of unusual activity. Haven sees Mick Marion going by on the road towards the mill. Mick passes not far away and is riding hard. Haven watches as Mick arrives and Pete can be seen in conference with him. Other men too many are gathered around. At last Haven dismounts and makes his way carefully on foot towards the warehouse.

FADE OUT: FADE IN EXT. ARMY POST - DAWN As Haven rides up, a detachment of men supervised by Stellman is forming beside mounts in the parade ground. Haven dismounts and starts inside. He glances at his wagon parked outside. It is the one Mrs. Caslon took from him. He smiles slightly as he notes it.

HAVEN: You lost some uniforms? You thought they were burned?
ILES: They were.
HAVEN: No, they weren't, but they are now because I just set fire to them.
ILES: ( rising ) What's this?
HAVEN: They're smouldering right now in the warehouse at the sawmill, and there are about seventy men down there who were ready to wear them.
ILES: Wear them? What for?
HAVEN: What other reason? To get in the post and take the gold from you.
HAVEN: You were taking a detachment up north on an Indian scare?
HAVEN: Well, that scare is a fake. A ruse. So you know where to send them now.
ILES: Look here, Lieutenant
HAVEN: Haven dips into a lining pocket under his arm and tosses a paper at Iles. Iles glances at it, then looks, thunderstruck, at Haven.
ILES: You better get down to that sawmill, Captain. They may try it anyway.
HAVEN: You better get down to that sawmill, Captain. They may try it anyway.
ILES: I guess I owe you an apology.
HAVEN: ( extending his hand ) I'll take it.

HAVEN: Only fifty thousand.
