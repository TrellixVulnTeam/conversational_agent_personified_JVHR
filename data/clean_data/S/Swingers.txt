MIKE: And what if I don't want to give up on You don't call.
ROB: You don't call.
MIKE: But you said I shouldn't call if I
ROB: So I don't call either way.
MIKE: So I don't call either way.
ROB: So what's the difference?
MIKE: So what's the difference?
ROB: The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
MIKE: So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
ROB: Well that sucks.
MIKE: Well that sucks.
ROB: It sucks.
MIKE: So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
ROB: Right.or more likely the opposite.
MIKE: Right. Wait, what do you mean?
ROB: I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call - whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
MIKE: Unless she comes back first.
ROB: Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
MIKE: There's the rub.
ROB: There's the rub.
MIKE: Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time.
ROB: Hey man, don't sweat it.
MIKE: .It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
ROB: No problem.
MIKE: Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
ROB: Thanks. Thanks, man.

ANSWERING MACHINE: ( synthesized voice ) Ever since I've known you.
MIKE: I don't know about that.
ANSWERING MACHINE: ( synthesized voice ) Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
MIKE: It didn't feel that way.
ANSWERING MACHINE: ( synthesized voice ) That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
MIKE: Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.

But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.

TRENT: Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
MIKE: Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
TRENT: What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.

MIKE: Cut that shit out.

MIKE: That's not cool.
TRENT: Did she, or did she not smile?
MIKE: It doesn't matter.
TRENT: I'm telling you, they love that shit.
MIKE: You're gonna screw up our plan.
TRENT: We're gonna get laid, baby.
MIKE: First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
TRENT: What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
MIKE: Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
TRENT: Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
MIKE: The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.

MIKE: ( hastily laying down the bills ) Oh. right.
DEALER: Mike's attention is recaptured by the dealer, but Trent continues trying to peer through the smoked glass.
MIKE: You want this in black chips.
DEALER: You want this in black chips.
MIKE: Sure, that'll be fine.
MIKE: Do you have anything smaller?
DEALER: Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
WAITRESS: ( then to Trent ) How about you, Cap'n?
MIKE: ( to the waitress, but never breaking eye contact with the dealer ) I'll have a vodka martini, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry.

MIKE: ( disgusted with himself ) "Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones.".
TRENT: . It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though.

MIKE: No! Not the camera guy!
TRENT: I'm telling you!
LISA: So what happened?
TRENT: So, I swear to God this is exactly what he said. The producer says to me. now he's still crying. he says to me that I was great, that that was exactly what they were looking for.
MIKE: . So give me the fuckin part.
TRENT: Right? . that I nailed it. Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says So, what'd you say to him? "
MIKE: So, what'd you say to him? "
TRENT: It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.

MIKE: She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
TRENT: You didn't have to get into it, baby.
MIKE: Sorry about interrupting.
TRENT: Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
MIKE: Christy was nice.
TRENT: I didn't even like her, to be honest.
MIKE: She was hot.
TRENT: She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
MIKE: I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?

TRENT: Michelle went for you, right.
MIKE: That was different.
TRENT: I was younger. It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
MIKE: I was younger. It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
TRENT: That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, I just need some time.
MIKE: I just need some time.
TRENT: Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.

TRENT: Please. And you're sweating You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
MIKE: I hear she's getting real fat.
TRENT: Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
MIKE: I'm gonna try. I'm really gonna try.
ROB: I don't think I'm gonna take it.
MIKE: I's a gig.
ROB: I mean, I need the money.
MIKE: You're an actor. Find the Zen in the It's definitely a step back for me.
ROB: It's definitely a step back for me.
MIKE: Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
ROB: There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
MIKE: What do you want? You're tall.
ROB: Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
MIKE: You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
ROB: It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sit-com and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
MIKE: Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
ROB: I didn't want to say anything.
MIKE: I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
ROB: I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
MIKE: What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
ROB: I don't talk about her
MIKE: I don't talk about her
ROB: Oh no?
MIKE: I didn't mention her once today.
ROB: Well, until now. Tend the pin.
MIKE: The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate I do. Good for you, man.
ROB: I do. Good for you, man.
MIKE: I've decided to get out there. Go ahead. Play it out.
MIKE: I'm not making any more excuses for
ROB: Good to hear, Mikey.
MIKE: You want to hit the town tonight?
ROB: I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
MIKE: What do you have? A Pluto call back?
ROB: Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
MIKE: Count 'em up.
ROB: How many strokes?
MIKE: I don't know. Eight or Nine.
ROB: I'll give you an eight.
MIKE: What'd you get?
ROB: An eight.
MIKE: Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a
ROB: You better replace the pin, Chi-Chi. The natives look restless.
SUE: Bitch. You little bitch!
TRENT: Chelios to Roenick.!
SUE: You little bitch!
MIKE: Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
TRENT: Because he's a bitch.
SUE: That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
MIKE: You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
SUE: Hey, man. I took the Kings to the
TRENT: . against the
SUE: They're a finesse team.
TRENT: They're a bitch team.
SUE: Give it up, Sue.
MIKE: Give it up, Sue.
SUE: ( re: game )
TRENT: I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
MIKE: This version doesn't have fighting?
TRENT: No. Doesn't that suck?
MIKE: What? That was the best part of the old I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
SUE: I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
TRENT: You could make their heads bleed, though.
SUE: Yeah. If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs It's kinda money, actually.
MIKE: It's kinda money, actually.
TRENT: It's kinda money, actually.
SUE: It's kinda money, actually.
MIKE: Make someone bleed.
SUE: No, man, we're in the play-offs.
TRENT: I'll make Gretsky bleed, the little
SUE: Pause it.
MIKE: Give me the money. I'll get it.
SUE: Sue dives onto Trent. They wrestle a little too rambunctiously for indoors. Trent pulls the hockey sweater over Sue's head and starts wailing on his back. Mike crosses. The CAMERA follows him down a shallow hallway to the door. He unlocks it. A delivery man of eastern-hemispheric decent is out of breath from four flights of stairs. He hands Mike a twelve-pack of Bud cans and three packs of Marlboro reds. He can HEAR, but NOT SEE, the chaos ensuing in the living 31 INT. SUE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 31 Trent and Sue are flushed. They pause long enough to torment
TRENT: ( feigning homosexuality ) Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
SUE: ( following suit ) . Is he brown?
MIKE: You guys are such assholes.
TRENT: ( continuing the gag ) Aww. He got away?
SUE: ( untangling himself from Trent ) Gimme my reds. I've been jonesing for an
MIKE: What time's this party tonight?
TRENT: It starts at eight.
SUE: . which means no one will get there 'til ten.
MIKE: So, what? Eleven?
MIKE: I'm gonna bring and old friend who just moved out here.
TRENT: Who? Rob?
MIKE: Yeah. You met him once.
TRENT: ( approvingly ) Yeah. He's a "rounder".
SUE: What's he do?
MIKE: He's trying to be an actor.
TRENT: What a surprise.
SUE: . How novel.
ROB: So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
MIKE: To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
ROB: ( beat ) Where is this place?
MIKE: ( pulling handle ) It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
ROB: That doesn't sound too good for business.
MIKE: ( pull ) It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism.
ROB: Sounds more like Aids.
MIKE: . That's probably a more appropriate
MIKE: Kinda money, huh?
ROB: ( smiling )
MIKE: I'll get a Dewars rocks.
ROB: .A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud,
MIKE: .A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud,
ROB: I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
MIKE: I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene Darwinism at its best.
ROB: Darwinism at its best.
MIKE: I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
ROB: It's like, woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
MIKE: Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
ROB: I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
MIKE: Ah, there's the rub.
ROB: There's the rub.
CHARLES: ( o.s. ) Whassup Mikey?
MIKE: Charles! What's up, man?
CHARLES: Oh. You know.
MIKE: Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
CHARLES: No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway.
MIKE: . piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East. My pleasure.
CHARLES: My pleasure.
ROB: My pleasure.
MIKE: Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
ROB: I just tested for one.
MIKE: . yeah, a month ago.
CHARLES: Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
ROB: I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
CHARLES: You haven't told then, huh?
ROB: I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps . and boy does it hurt when they ask.
CHARLES: I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps . and boy does it hurt when they ask.
MIKE: . and boy does it hurt when they ask.
CHARLES: I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore.
MIKE: . not until you book it.
CHARLES: . and even then.
MIKE: . you might get cut out.
ROB: I'm considering taking a job as a Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
CHARLES: Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
MIKE: You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
CHARLES: ( yelling over the roar of the wall to wall crowd ) Why not? This place is dead anyway.
TRENT: . No, baby. I got a better one. You gotta admit the steadycam shot in "Goodfellas" was the money.
ROB: . through the basement of that . the Copa, in New York.
MIKE: . the Copa, in New York.
TRENT: . through the kitchen.
CHARLES: . I heard it took four days to light for that shot.
ROB: . Four days..?
SUE: . I don't know about
CHARLES: . That's what I heard.
MIKE: . Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the . It looked money.
TRENT: . It looked money.
SUE: . Not as money as the shot from
ROB: . Which one?
SUE: . In the beginning. When they're walking in slow motion.
MIKE: . How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese.
SUE: . He's
TRENT: . You gotta admit, it looked money.
CHARLES: .. I heard they made that whole movie for ten grand.
ROB: . What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
MIKE: ( checking his watch ) Well, let's hit that party.
MIKE: Who threw this party, anyway?
SUE: Damned if I know.
TRENT: . Beats me.
CHARLES: . I came with
ROB: What's that guy's name?
MIKE: Oh, like that song.
ROB: Oh, like that song.
MIKE: . "A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
ROB: He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth. blood. He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom. fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
MIKE: He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth. blood. He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom. fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
TRENT: Oh, it's
SUE: . It's
MIKE: There are so many beautiful women here.
ROB: It's unbelievable.
MIKE: I got to at least try once.
ROB: You're a better man than I am, Charlie No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or Go for it, man.
MIKE: No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or Go for it, man.
ROB: Go for it, man.
MIKE: ( indicating the ladies ) I'm going in. Will you be my wing-man?
ROB: I'll be your winger.
MIKE: Good evening, ladies.
MIKE: How are you ladies doing this evening?
BLONDE: What do you drive?
MIKE: I'm sorry?
BLONDE: What kind of
MIKE: Oh. a Cavalier.
MIKE: . It's red?
TRENT: Is she looking at me, baby?
SUE: Is she looking now?
TRENT: Is she looking now?
SUE: Is she looking now?
TRENT: Is she looking now?
SUE: hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if. Wait, she just looked.
TRENT: See, baby?
MIKE: How you guys doing?
TRENT: It's on.
MIKE: Which one?
TRENT: ( indicated the group of girls with a subtle head move ) Minnie Pearl.
MIKE: The one in the hat? She's cute.
TRENT: What are you doing?
MIKE: You looked
TRENT: You looked
MIKE: She didn't notice.
SUE: Yes she did.
TRENT: Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
MIKE: I'm sorry.
TRENT: Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-
SUE: How's it going for you two?
MIKE: Not well.
SUE: Mike's P.O.V. of Trent passing near and the GIRL IN THE HAT. He says something, smiles, and points to her hat. She
ROB: Mike's P.O.V. of Trent passing near and the GIRL IN THE HAT. He says something, smiles, and points to her hat. She
SUE: Well, just watch the T-bone and learn.
TRENT: ( nodding in agreement )
TRENT: BACK TO:
TRENT: CUT TO:
SUE: Here comes the kill.
TRENT: Was I money?
MIKE: I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
TRENT: Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
MIKE: You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
TRENT: She didn't see.
MIKE: That doesn't matter.
SUE: What was cold about it?
TRENT: What was cold about it?
TRENT: She offered me her number. What should I have said? "No"? That would've hurt her feelings. This way she feels like the winner.
TRENT: Tee can't roll with that, she's "business "Business class"?
ROB: "Business class"?
SUE: ( explaining to Rob ) Big butt. you know, can't fly coach.
MIKE: I can't believe you.
CHARLES: They're out of Glenlivet.
MIKE: What else is going on?
TRENT: We could hit the Dresden.
SUE: Yeah. This place is dead, anyway.
CHARLES: I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you.
ROB: . I mean, does it have to be " I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud.

SUE: As they get up to leave.

MIKE: ( to himself ) I can't even get this guy to notice me.
MIKE: You like laughing at the misery of I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you. What can I get you?

TRENT: . Anaheim.
SUE: . Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
MIKE: Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it.
SUE: . People get carjacked.
TRENT: . Oh, who would jack your fuckin K-car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
SUE: Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them.

ANSWERING MACHINE: ( synthesized voice ) Don't do it, Mike.
MIKE: Shut up.
NIKKI: ( recorded ) Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. ( beep )

NIKKI: ( recorded ) Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. ( beep )

NIKKI: ( recorded ) Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. ( beep )
MIKE: Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all.
NIKKI: ( recorded ) Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. ( beep )
MIKE: Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months.
NIKKI: ( Live, in person. she picks up the line ) Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
MIKE: Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
NIKKI: ( calmly ) Don't call me ever again.
MIKE: Wow, I guess you were home.
ANSWERING MACHINE: ( Trent's voice ) . Pick up.. Pick up, Mikey. Are you home?
ANSWERING MACHINE: ( Trent's voice ) . I guess you're not home. Why don't you come out tonight, baby. We haven't seen you for two days. We're gonna play hockey at Sue's house til ten thirty then we're either going to the Lava Lounge for Sinatra night, or the Derby for the Royal Crown. We might also check out Swing Night at the Viper.

ROB: Mike shakes his head again.
ROB: You haven't been drinking, have you?
MIKE: No. Just O.J.
MIKE: Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea.
ROB: Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. You want to talk about it?
ROB: You want to talk about it?
MIKE: What's the point?
ROB: It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki.
MIKE: Oh boy.
ROB: Oh boy.
MIKE: I'm such an asshole.
ROB: She wasn't your type anyway. I think I'm gonna move Back East.
MIKE: I think I'm gonna move Back East.
ROB: What's dumb about it?
MIKE: What's dumb about it?
ROB: Well, you're doing so well.
MIKE: How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
ROB: At least you didn't get turned down for They turned you down?
MIKE: They turned you down?
ROB: They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
ROB: See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too.
MIKE: I didn't make it.
ROB: That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money".
MIKE: ( starting to cry ) Then why won't she call.?
ROB: Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
MIKE: How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
ROB: Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
MIKE: . for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
ROB: . for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
MIKE: ( finishing the loaf ) You wanna grab a bite?
ROB: ( smiling )
ROB: By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
MIKE: ( smiling ) You always know the right thing to say.
TRENT: Mikey! Guys, Mikey's here!
BALD GUY: Bitch! You bitch!
SUE: Trent. Take over.
SUE: I got rid of the gun
MIKE: What are they
SUE: We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk. But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk. My adrenaline was going.
SUE: But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk. My adrenaline was going.

MIKE: Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either.
BRUNETTE: Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
MIKE: ( smirk ) No. Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready

ANSWERING MACHINE: ( synthesized voice ) You're money, baby.
MIKE: Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
LORRAINE: Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days. Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl. It's just that it's tonight only. I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is?

FRANK: Here's to those who love not too wisely, no, not too wisely, but too well. To the girl who sighs with envy when she hears that wedding bell. To the guy who'd throw a party if he knew someone to call. Here's to the losers. Bless them all.
FRANK: Here's to those who drink their dinners when that lady doesn't show. To the girls who wait for kisses underneath that mistletoe. To the lonely summer lovers when the leaves begin to fall. Here's to the losers. Bless them all. Hey Tom, Dick and Harry. Come in out of the rain. Those torches you carry. Must be drowned in champagne.
FRANK: Hey Tom, Dick and Harry. Come in out of the rain. Those torches you carry. Must be drowned in champagne.
FRANK: Here's the last toast of the evening. Here's to those who still believe. All the losers will be winners. All the givers shall receive. Here's to trouble-free tomorrows. May your sorrows all be small. Here's to the losers. Bless them all.
