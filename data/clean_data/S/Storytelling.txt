STORYTELLING: Todd Solondz
MARCUS: Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
VI: ( lifts a MS from a shelf by his bed ) I can read it to you.
MARCUS: ( lifts a MS from a shelf by his bed ) I can read it to you.
VI: You mean, again?
MARCUS: Well, I changed the ending a Oh. What happens now?
VI: Oh. What happens now?
MARCUS: Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
VI: Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
MARCUS: But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
VI: I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
MARCUS: So you don't want to hear my new You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me. Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her She rises, starts dressing.
VI: You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me. Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her She rises, starts dressing.
MARCUS: You're tired of me. I can tell.
VI: Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
MARCUS: You've lost interest.You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
VI: I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
MARCUS: Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone.You've become kind.
MARCUS: ".but when he saw her.it was as if he could walk like a normal person. His legs didn't swing, his arms didn't spaz away.He wasn't a freak any more, for she made him forget his affliction. No more cerebral palsy! From now on "CP" stood for.cerebral person. He was a cerebral person.
AMY: I thought it was really good, Marcus.Really moving and Yeah, I thought it was really emotional, too.
ELLI: Yeah, I thought it was really emotional, too.
AMY: And I mean, really good word choices. It kind of reminded me a little of Faulkner, but East Coast and disabled.
LUCY: Or Flannery O'Connor. She had multiple sclerosis.
JOYCE: And Borges. He was blind.
ETHAN: Updike has psoriasis.
CATHERINE: Um.Maybe I'm wrong, but, um, I'm afraid I found the whole thing to be a little trite. Its earnestness is, well.it's a little embarrassing. And those adjectives, they're a little flatfooted. And redundant. I'm sorry, but.Anyway, what do I know? Don't even listen to what I say. I mean.
MR SCOTT: Anyone else?
MR SCOTT: Catherine is right. The story's a piece of shit. You express nothing but banalities and, formally speaking, are unable to construct a single compelling sentence. You ride on a wave of clichés so worn, in fact, it actually approaches a level of grotesquerie. Ad your subtitle, 'the rawness of truth' is that supposed to be a joke of some sort? Or are you just being OK. Who's next?
VI: Marcus, wait up!
MARCUS: What do you want?
VI: Don't be so upset. It's OK.
MARCUS: What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
VI: ( beat ) You know he hated my story also.
MARCUS: Your story was terrible!
VI: Marcus.You'll write something better next time!
MARCUS: Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
VI: That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like that bitch Catherine.
MARCUS: Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so.convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
VI: I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so.convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
MARCUS: You just want to fuck him. Like Catherine and every other white cunt on campus.
MELINDA: Vi? Are you OK?
VI: Yes. I'm OK. I'm totally OK.
MELINDA: You did the right thing.
VI: I know that. Fucking cripple. Why do I waste my time with undergrads? They're all so.juvenile! Uch! I just thought Marcus would be different. I mean he's got CP!
MELINDA: What are you gonna do now?
VI: I dunno.go to a bar.get laid.whatever.Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.
VI: Can I have a beer?
MR SCOTT: Hello, Vi.
VI: What are you doing here?
MR SCOTT: What are you doing here?
VI: I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
MR SCOTT: Well, now you have.
VI: Yeah, um, then.are you alone?
MR SCOTT: Uh huh.
VI: Can I join you?
MR SCOTT: You're not.
VI: ( beat ) 'Cause I.um.I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story That's good.
MR SCOTT: That's good.
VI: And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
MR SCOTT: You have beautiful skin.
VI: Thank you. So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
MR SCOTT: Maybe. She's OK.
VI: Aren't you going out with I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean.
MR SCOTT: I'm not 'going out' with Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
VI: ( beat ) Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
MR SCOTT: Thank you for being honest.
VI: Thank you for being honest.
VI: I have so much respect for you.
VI: Can I just freshen up for a He indicates the direction of the bathroom.
MR SCOTT: It's over there.
VI: INT. MR SCOTT'S BATHROOM - NIGHT Vi enters, locks the door behind her. She looks at herself in the mirror, then notices a snapshot of Catherine: she is naked, legs open wide. Other erotic photographs lie beneath Catherine's.
VI: ( to herself, almost chanting ) Don't be a racist. Don't be a racist. Don't be a racist.
VI: It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
MR SCOTT: Take off your top.
MR SCOTT: Now.take off the rest.
MR SCOTT: Turn around.
MR SCOTT: Bend over.
VI: Oh, bu.uh.I can't say that.
MR SCOTT: Say, Ni.
VI: MR SCOTT MR SCOTT Say, 'Nigger.'
MR SCOTT: MR SCOTT Say, 'Nigger.'
VI: MR SCOTT Say, 'Nigger.'
MR SCOTT: Say, 'Nigger.'
VI: MR SCOTT 'Fuck me hard!'
MR SCOTT: 'Fuck me hard!'
VI: Fuck me hard!
MR SCOTT: Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
VI: Nigger, fuck me hard!
MR SCOTT: Nigger, fuck me hard!!.
VI: Nigger, fuck me hard!!.
MR SCOTT: NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!. EXT. MARCUS'S DORMITORY - NIGHT Lights are out.
VI: NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!. EXT. MARCUS'S DORMITORY - NIGHT Lights are out.
MARCUS: There is a soft knock at the door. He turns away from the mirror and opens it. Vi is there, teary-eyed, disheveled.
VI: Can I come in?
MARCUS: You're all.sweaty!
VI: '.So John flipped her around and slammed her against the wall. Jane braced herself: she thought about her mother. She thought about Peter. She thought about God.and rape. ''Say, 'Fuck me, nigger. Fuck me hard.''' John's flesh abraded her soft skin. There would be marks. She acquiesced, and said what he asked her to say, and did what he asked her to do. She had entered college with hope, with dignity, but she would graduate as a whore.'
AMY: Why do people have to be so ugly.write about such ugly characters? It's perverted. I know you all think I'm being prisssy, but I don't care. I was brought up in a certain way. And this Yeah, well, it did seem a little affected. Like by using taboo language you were trying to shock us about the hollowness of your I think it was a little bit It was completely racist, and beyond that I felt deeply offended as a woman. As if a woman can only operate from experiences of Totally phallocentric.
JOYCE: Yeah, well, it did seem a little affected. Like by using taboo language you were trying to shock us about the hollowness of your I think it was a little bit It was completely racist, and beyond that I felt deeply offended as a woman. As if a woman can only operate from experiences of Totally phallocentric.
ETHAN: I think it was a little bit It was completely racist, and beyond that I felt deeply offended as a woman. As if a woman can only operate from experiences of Totally phallocentric.
ELLI: It was completely racist, and beyond that I felt deeply offended as a woman. As if a woman can only operate from experiences of Totally phallocentric.
SUE: Totally phallocentric.
ELLI: And so weirdly misogynistic. I mean, why does Jane go through with this? Is she stupid?
ETHAN: Hey, But wasn't this a rape? Or .did I miss something? Because I - I'm confused. Because if this was a rape, then why would she be a whore?
CATHERINE: ( beat ) It was confessional, yet dishonest. Jane pretends to be horrified by the sexuality that she in fact fetishizes. She subsumes herself to the myth of black male potency, but then doesn't follow through. She thinks she 'respects Afro-Americans,' she thinks they're 'cool,' 'exotic,' what a notch he 'd make in her belt, but, of course, it all comes down to mandingo cliché, and he calls her on it. In classic racist tradition she demonizes, then runs for cover. But then, how could she behave otherwise? She's just a spoiled suburban white girl with a Benneton rainbow complex. It's just my opinion, and what do I know.but I think it's a callow piece of writing.
MR SCOTT: Callow and coy. Jane wants more, but isn't honest enough to admit it. In the end, she returns to the safety of her crippled ( translation: sexually impotent ) This is bullshit! Her story was the truth!
MARCUS: This is bullshit! Her story was the truth!
JOYCE: It's unbelievable!
SUE: It's unbelievable!
ELLI: It's clichéd!
AMY: It's disgusting!
VI: But it happened!
MR SCOTT: I don't know about 'what happened,' Vi, because once you start writing, it all becomes fiction. Still, it certainly is an improvement over your last story: There is now at least a beginning, a middle, and an end.
TOBY: Hello, is this Pam?
TOBY: Toby Oxman.
TOBY: Oh, fine. How are you?
TOBY: PAM ( V.O. ) So what's going on?
TOBY: That's what I was gonna ask you.

TOBY: Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
TOBY: Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh.so I dropped out.
TOBY: Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
TOBY: Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.

BRADY: But I thought he came over to America before the war.
FERN: Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
BRADY: Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
FERN: But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or Or me?

TOBY: Well, sir.uh.I'm actually not doing this for the money. When you make a documentary, you do it for many reasons, but money is certainly not one of them.
MR KIRK: I don't get it.
TOBY: Well, sir, a lot has happened to the landscape of the suburban high school since I was a student, and I feel it would be a valuable, perhaps even enlightening endeavor, to chronicle the changes, to get intimate with the realities kids and parents face in American schools today.
MR KIRK: Yeah, well, whatever. I'll let you know if there's interest.
TOBY: Excuse me, where's the bathroom?
SCOOBY: You a pervert?

FERN: I thought this was about kids getting into college.
TOBY: Oh, it is. I mean 
MARTY: Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
TOBY: You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
MARTY: And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
TOBY: Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 

MARTY: Yeah.How do we know we won't be No, it's true.
FERN: No, it's true.
TOBY: Mr Livingston, I fully understand and I share your concerns. You fell vulnerable. And I know that this is a very difficult question, but what it comes down to is: can you make a leap of faith in me, in the same way that I have to make a leap of faith in you?
ESPOSITO: This is a great school. I don't care what anybody says. I mean, it's not perfect, but like the people are really cool, like the teachers and kids.they really care and all. And I know that they make fun of New Jersey all the time, but I don't care. 'Cause they're just snobs. 'Cause Jersey is where America's at!
TOBY: So whaddya think?
EDITOR: Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
TOBY: I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
EDITOR: You're showing how superior you are to your subject.
TOBY: No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
EDITOR: No, you don't.

And the new wing at Beth Israel is.Well, actually, last year you gave $500. But this year $1,000 would not only be a mitzvah, it would bring you to a new level.Yes, of course. Your gift would also give you a Chagall menorah and two tickets to the dinner dance this spring.Because it's true: Israel needs us now. If not now, when?.Well, that's wonderful.I'll speak to you next week.You too! Take care!

CONAN: TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.

EDITOR: This is definitely better.
TOBY: You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
EDITOR: This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
TOBY: Yes, I know But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
EDITOR: I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
TOBY: No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
EDITOR: You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
TOBY: Nothing, I guess
EDITOR: I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate OK, you're right, you're right You know, we need to screen what we've got invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types and see what real people think of this.
TOBY: OK, you're right, you're right You know, we need to screen what we've got invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types and see what real people think of this.
EDITOR: I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
TOBY: OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
EDITOR: We're not ready.
TOBY: Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
EDITOR: We're not ready!
TOBY: Well, I need to see this with an What's an audience going to tell I don't know. Maybe they'll like INT. LIVINGSTON HOME  NIGHT Mikey opens the refrigerator, takes out a bottle of grape juice, pours a cup for himself, then accidentally spills it all on the floor.

MIKEY: You have a bay?
CONSUELO: My grandchild-baby.

CONSUELO: He's dead.
MIKEY: Oh. How did it happen?
CONSUELO: He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
MIKEY: How did they execute him?
CONSUELO: Poison gas.
MIKEY: ( beat ) Maybe it's for the best I mean, if he was guilty of doing something wrong People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
CONSUELO: Jesus was not bad.
MIKEY: Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
CONSUELO: He wasn't.
MIKEY: But still, you can't be sure.
CONSUELO: I am sure.
MIKEY: But really, you never know.
CONSUELO: I know!
MIKEY: ( beat ) Why was he on Death Row?
CONSUELO: For rape and murder.
MIKEY: Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
CONSUELO: ( beat ) It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.

MIKEY: Dad? Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
MARTY: One in a million recover.
MIKEY: Maybe he's that one in a million!
MARTY: Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.

MIKEY: Now you are completely under my power. I am the only voice you can hear, the only voice you will listen to. Now. When you wake up you will be in a good mood. You won't worry so much about Brady. And I will be your favorite from now on. If Brady dies, you can be sad for a little bit, but I will still be the most important person in your life. You will never be mean to me, and always give me whatever I want. Also, you should fire Consuelo. She's lazy. Now when I snap my fingers, you will remember nothing, but you will do everything I have asked. One. Two. Mikey snaps his fingers and Marty wakes up.
