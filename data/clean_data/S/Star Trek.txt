AMANDA: . hello.
YOUNGER MIDWIFE: The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?
MIDWIFE: ( a beat; then ) She is human.
SAREK: Well done.
AMANDA: He regards her. Knows he's in TROUBLE
SAREK: Your tone suggests disappointment. The Science Council required my presence for a session regarding
AMANDA: Don't do that. You knew I wanted you As you are aware, the Vulcan male is traditionally not present at the moment of delivery.
SAREK: As you are aware, the Vulcan male is traditionally not present at the moment of delivery.
AMANDA: Well traditionally, I'm not the one giving birth.
SAREK: You are correct. I should have been here. I am sorry.
AMANDA: No. Spock. . Spock.
SAREK: The child has your eyes.
AMANDA: . and your ears.
CAPTAIN ROBAU: turning to the ship's FIRST OFFICER: 32, all-American face, swiveling in a console chair to FACE US:
FIRST OFFICER: Sir, new contact bearing zero-three-four.
CAPTAIN ROBAU: Any response?
OFFICER PITTS: No Sir hails met with silence.
CAPTAIN ROBAU: Maybe they're incapable any identifiable damage?
OFFICER PITTS: Negative, Sir but our readings seem
CAPTAIN ROBAU: OFFICER PITTS
OFFICER PITTS: not only is the ship unregistered but even its construction materials seem
CAPTAIN ROBAU: . oh my God. A lightning storm. then this. Signal all departments: first contact protocols. Looks like we have someone new on the block. All Stop.
FIRST OFFICER: Sir, should we initiate an invasive scan?
CAPTAIN ROBAU: That could be seen as an act of provocation all readings passive
CAPTAIN ROBAU: Damage report!
CHIEF ENGINEER: Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never seen anything like it! Weapons off-line! Main power at 38 percent!
WINONA: what was that what's happening?!
FIRST OFFICER: you're okay thank God where are Medical bay I had a few close contractions I'm fine what was that?
WINONA: Medical bay I had a few close contractions I'm fine what was that?
FIRST OFFICER: Just sit tight stay there we'll be

CAPTAIN ROBAU: All remaining power to forward shields! Prepare the shuttles f
AYEL: My commander requests the presence of your captain in order to negotiate a cease-fire. You will come aboard our ship via shuttlecraft. Your refusal would be unwise.
CAPTAIN ROBAU: Walk with me.
CAPTAIN ROBAU: If I don't report within fifteen minutes, execute general order 13.
FIRST OFFICER: Sir, we could issue a mayday call to
CAPTAIN ROBAU: ( frightened, but firm ) There is no help for us out here. If we're going down, we're taking them with us you save as many as you can.
8A: 26A CONTINUED: 26A
FIRST OFFICER: . aye, Captain.
CAPTAIN ROBAU: You're Captain now. Mr. Kirk.
GEORGE KIRK: Lieutenant Pitts. Transfer Robau's vital signs to the main view screen.
OFFICER PITTS: In a moment, Robau's VITAL SIGNS appear on various monitors his HEART RATE, OXYGEN LEVELS, BLOOD PRESSURE, all of it. A LOW- PITCHED BEEPBEEP of his HEARTBEAT is now HEARD
SCIENCE OFFICER: Vitals on line.
GEORGE KIRK: ( slightly awkward ) thank you.
CAPTAIN ROBAU: Computer, initiate departure sequence.
OFFICER PITTS: The shuttle's pulling out of main bay, I want to see him floodlights please.
GEORGE KIRK: I want to see him floodlights please.
OFFICER PITTS: His heart rate's elevated
HELMSMAN: He's scared.
GEORGE KIRK: He's brave. That's what he is.
AYEL: Are you familiar with this craft?
CAPTAIN ROBAU: Who is your commander? Is it him?
AYEL: You will speak only to me.
CAPTAIN ROBAU: Then ask your commander what right he has to attack a Federation vessel.
AYEL: That was hardly an attack. My commander will easily destroy your ship. If you do not respond to the question.
CAPTAIN ROBAU: I've never seen it. Or any ship like it.
AYEL: Are you familiar with or better, know the location of Ambassador Spock?
CAPTAIN ROBAU: I am unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.
AYEL: A final question. What is the current
CAPTAIN ROBAU: ( the fuck? ) . Stardate? . it's 2233.04. ( finally ) . hey, where are you from?
GEORGE KIRK: I'm initiating General Order 13! Set self-destruct for maximum matter- antimatter yield! Two minute countdown!

WINONA: Yes where are you?
GEORGE KIRK: I'm on my way.
WINONA: Good and George, it's coming our baby, it's coming now.

SHUTTLE PILOT: We're waiting for you, Sir
GEORGE KIRK: No go, take off, immediately.
SHUTTLE PILOT: . yessir!
WINONA: Wait! We can't go, my husband isn't here yet! Please! STOP!

WINONA: no no, no wait
DOCTOR: Okay you need to push.
GEORGE KIRK: Hey! Hey, so what is it?
WINONA'S VOICE: it's a boy.
GEORGE KIRK: It's a boy? Yeah?
WINONA: He's he's beautiful, he looks like you.
GEORGE KIRK: I know so what should we call him, huh?
WINONA: We could name him after your father.
GEORGE KIRK: Tiberius? Are you kidding me? No, that's the worst we'll name him after your dad let's call him Jim.
WINONA: . Jim. Jim it is.
AYEL: ( SUBTITLED, in Romulan ) Commander Nero we're surrounded.
COMPUTER VOICE: Your score is one-hundred percent. Congratulations. Spock.
YOUNG SPOCK: I presume you've prepared new insults for Your mother lies with many men.
YOUNG SPOCK: I have no such information.
YOUNG SPOCK: ( swallowing that too ) This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit an emotional response from me. Logic dictates you would cease by now.
YOUNG SPOCK: I did not mean to create conflict between you and mother.
SAREK: In marriage. conflict is.
YOUNG SPOCK: . constant?
SAREK: ( a beat ) Emotions run deep within our race. In many ways, more deeply than in humans. Long ago, they nearly destroyed us. that is why we followed the teachings of Surak. Now you must choose.
YOUNG SPOCK: . between you and mother?
SAREK: Never, my son. But you may choose the ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience. The control of feelings. so that they do not control They called you a traitor. You suggest that I should be completely Vulcan. and yet you married a human.
YOUNG SPOCK: They called you a traitor. You suggest that I should be completely Vulcan. and yet you married a human.
SAREK: As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to observe and understand human behavior. Marrying your mother. was logical. Spock. You are fully capable of choosing your own destiny. The question you are faced with. is which path you will take. This is something only you can
UNCLE FRANK: Go ahead: go run away! You know I could give a damn!
YOUNG KIRK: wait no! Where are you going?
UNCLE FRANK: Which won't be far enough know what your problem is?! No one ever taught you respect! How to follow orders! Do as you're told! what the hell are you doing?
YOUNG KIRK: I I just don't want my brother to go.
UNCLE FRANK: Well I do and I asked you to wash the car! How many damn times do I need to repeat myself?! How many damn times? How many?
YOUNG KIRK: Please stay you can have my Flo-Yo!
JIM: Don't leave okay? We can tell Mom when she gets back from Africa.
COP: Son, you pull over that car!
JIM: I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
COP: What's your name, son?
JIM: My name's Kirk. James Tiberius Kirk.
ALIEN: ( SUBTITLED ) I speak the truth. I do.
KLINGON GUARD: Then who are they for?
ALIEN: . NERO!!!
. NERO!!!: And the Guards look at each other. seemingly with concern. MOMENTS LATER EIGHT GUARDS WALK TOGETHER and we PAN WITH THEM to reveal the HORRIFYING EXPANSE THAT IS THE KLINGON PRISON YARD. We realize that the constant shocks of light was LIGHTNING, that apparently never stops here. A SUPER READS: "RURA PENTHE - KLINGON PRISON ASTEROID". And we see they're heading for a MUSCULAR FIGURE, using a SLEDGE HAMMER, SPLITTING ROCKS, lit brilliantly by the lightning strikes. BOOM UP to find that it's NERO. And he stops, SENSING the coming Guards. And he manages a small smile. And he QUICKLY TURNS to them THEY ALL STOP, SUDDENLY. Afraid of him. One of them tosses Nero a set of MANACLES. Nero picks them up. Puts them on. And offers his cuffed hands, willingly.
KLINGON INTERROGATOR: ( SUBTITLED KLINGON ) I have come far to meet you. "The One Who Does Not Speak." Ten years is a long time to maintain silence. ( beat ) Perhaps you simply do not speak Klingon, just as I do not speak Romulan.
AMANDA: Spock, come here, let me see you.
AMANDA: Reluctantly, Spock walks into frame. She begins adjusting his collar. This is our ADULT SPOCK. Gripped by anxiety but trying like hell to look impassive.
SPOCK: I am hardly "anxious", mother. And "fine" has variable definitions. "Fine" is unacceptable.
AMANDA: . anything.
SPOCK: Should I choose to complete the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr. and purge all emotion. I trust you will not feel it reflects judgement upon you.
AMANDA: As always. whoever you choose to be. you will have a proud mother.
SCIENCE MINISTER: You have surpassed the expectations of your instructors. Your final record is flawless. With one exception. I see you have applied to Starfleet as well.
SPOCK: It was logical to cultivate multiple Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy. A distinction all the more significant given that you will be its first half- human pupil. It is truly remarkable, Spock. That you have achieved so much despite your disadvantage. Welcome to the Academy.
SCIENCE MINISTER: Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy. A distinction all the more significant given that you will be its first half- human pupil. It is truly remarkable, Spock. That you have achieved so much despite your disadvantage. Welcome to the Academy.
SPOCK: If you would clarify, Minister what "disadvantage" are you referring to?
SCIENCE MINISTER: . your human mother.
SPOCK: Council ministers. I must decline.
SCIENCE MINISTER: No Vulcan has ever declined admission to this academy.
SPOCK: Then as I am half-human, your record remains untarnished.
SCIENCE MINISTER: Why did you come before this council today? Was it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel?
SPOCK: I came with the intention of enrolling, as my father wished. However, your "insight" has convinced me otherwise. Therefore, the only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude. Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration. Live long and prosper.
UHURA: Hi. I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea, two Cardassian Sunrises and three Earth beers, no slim-shots, anything on draft.
UHURA: And a shot of Jack, straight up.
KIRK: ( to the bartender ) Make it two her shot's on me.
UHURA: Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.
KIRK: Don't you want my name before you completely reject me?
UHURA: I'm good without it.
KIRK: You are good without it. It's Jim. Jim If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna have to make one up.
UHURA: ( beat ) Uhura? No way that's the name I was gonna make up for you. Uhura what?
KIRK: Uhura? No way that's the name I was gonna make up for you. Uhura what?
UHURA: Just Uhura.
KIRK: They don't have last names in your world?
UHURA: Uhura is my last name.
KIRK: They don't have first names in your world? Wait, let me guess. Is it "Jim"?
UHURA: Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't know what that means.
KIRK: Let me guess: study of Alien languages: phonology, morphology, syntax it means you've got a talented tongue.
UHURA: And for a moment I thought you were just a dumb hick who only has sex with farm Well. Not only.
KIRK: Well. Not only.
UHURA: You think you're smart.
KIRK: Oh, baby, I'm the smartest.
BURLY CADET: This guy bothering you?
UHURA: Beyond belief, but nothing I can't You could handle me. That's an
KIRK: You could handle me. That's an
BURLY CADET: Hey. You mind your manners.
KIRK: At ease, Cup Cake, it was a joke. Like your hairline.
UHURA: Hey Jim: enough.
BURLY CADET: What was that?
KIRK: You heard me, Moon Beam.
BURLY CADET: You know how to count farm boy? There's five of us. and one of you.
KIRK: Okay, so go get some more guys, come back and it'll be an even fight.
UHURA: Enough! STOP!
PIKE: Outside, all of you! NOW!
KIRK: You can. whistle really loud, y'know
PIKE: I couldn't believe when the bartender told me who you are.
KIRK: . and who am I, Captain Pike?
PIKE: Your father's son. For my dissertation, I was assigned the U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about your dad. he didn't believe in no-win He sure learned his lesson.
KIRK: He sure learned his lesson.
PIKE: Depends on how you define winning. You're here, aren't you? That instinct to leap without looking that was his nature, too. And in my opinion it's something Starfleet has lost. We're admirable, respectable. But Those cadets you took on, they'll make competent officers but you can bet your ass they'll run home to momma the minute they're looking down the barrel of a Klingon phaser cannon.
KIRK: why are you talking to me?
PIKE: I looked up your file while you were drooling on the floor. Your aptitude tests were off the charts what is it, d'you like being the only Genius Level repeat-offender in the midwest?
KIRK: Maybe I love it.
PIKE: So your daddy dies. you can settle for a less-than-ordinary life. Or do you feel like you're meant for something better? Something special?
KIRK: Come to think of it, I do want to feel special. You know what? I'm gonna go start a book club
PIKE: Enlist in Starfleet.
KIRK: Enlist. You must be way down on your recruiting quota for the month
PIKE: If you're half the man your father was, Jim, Starfleet could use you. You could be an officer in four years, have your own ship in eight.
KIRK: We're even, right? I can go.
PIKE: Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800. Your father was Captain of a Starship. For twelve minutes. I dare you to do
SHUTTLE PILOT: Waiting for something, Cap?
PIKE: . No. Guess not.
SHIPYARD WORKER: Nice ride, man.
KIRK: Live it up.
UHURA: ( can't help it: a grin ) And you never will.
MAN'S VOICE: Are you people deaf? I told you I don't need a doctor, damnit! I AM A DOCTOR!
MAN: I might throw up on you.
KIRK: I think these things're pretty safe
MAN: Don't pander to me, kid: one tiny crack in the hull and our blood boils in thirteen seconds solar flare might crop up, cook us in our seats Hell, some of the damn passengers are blue. And wait'll you're sitting pretty with a case of Andorian shingles, see if you're still so relaxed when your eyeballs are bleeding space is disease and danger, wrapped in darkness and silence.
KIRK: I hate to break this to you, but Starfleet operates in space.
MAN: Yeah, well my ex-wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce, I got nowhere to go but up. Leonard McCoy.
KIRK: Jim Kirk you really gonna throw up?
MCCOY: As the TREK THEME SOARS, the shuttle ascends and we.
NERO: The wait is over.
KIRK: So you'll do it for me, right?
MCCOY: I have no interest.
KIRK: I didn't ask if you have interest, I asked if you'd do it.
MCCOY: I'm about to ask you an obvious question: why bother?
KIRK: Because I've failed the test twice.
MCCOY: And you're determined to make it three. We've all failed it everyone has, and that's the point! No one goes back for seconds, let alone thirds it's not like you need to pass it to graduate.
KIRK: So Bones: why do they make us take it?
MCCOY: I told you to stop calling me that. You're very annoying.
KIRK: And you're the greatest thank you.
MCCOY: You'd better study for it this time.
KIRK: Oh, no Bones I gotta date.
MCCOY: A date? Listen, as smart as you are, which ain't much, if you don't prepare
KIRK: You have no idea how prepared I'm gonna be no idea.
MCCOY: Seriously, stop calling me Bones!
GAILA: oh Jim. Jim. Jim, I love you.
KIRK: ( kissing her ) . Yeah. I sent you a message.
GAILA: I say "I love you", and you say "I sent you a message?"
UHURA: I was supposed to be, but it was crazy, I picked up an emergency transmission from a Klingon prison planet there was an escape and a ship stolen from th . you okay?
GAILA: Yeah, been running simulations all week, just catching up on some rest. Tired. That's all.
UHURA: Were you running simulations with the mouth-breather hiding under the bed?
KIRK: Your hearing is scary you sure both your parents are human?
UHURA: The hell are you doing with him in here?
KIRK: ( getting dressed, to You and I have a big day tomorrow
UHURA: ( pushing him out ) You're gonna fail.
KIRK: If I pass, will you tell me your first No. Good night.
UHURA: No. Good night.
KIRK: ( quiet, tries to charm ) I think the fact that you picked up a transmission of a Klingon prison escape is very interesting.
AYEL: We have arrived at the coordinates you requested. Stardate confirmed. 2258.5.
NERO: Ayel studies his console, hope in his eyes. Quietly:
AYEL: Captain. long range scans of Beta Quadrant complete. Romulus is there. She's there. We could go. Right now, go Not yet not like this. Not how we left. This is our chance. to serve our people. We owe it to them to do what no other Romulan could ever do.
NERO: Not yet not like this. Not how we left. This is our chance. to serve our people. We owe it to them to do what no other Romulan could ever do.
UHURA: we are receiving a distress signal from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru. The ship has lost power and is stranded. Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them.
KIRK: "Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them. Captain."
MCCOY: Klingon vessels have entered the Neutral Zone. And they are firing upon us.
KIRK: That's okay.
MCCOY: It's okay?
KIRK: Yeah, don't worry about it.
MCCOY: Three more Klingon Warbirds decloaking and targeting our ship I don't suppose this is a problem either?
KIRK: WEAPONS OFFICER
WEAPONS OFFICER: They're firing, Captain.
KIRK: Alert medical bay to prepare to receive all crew members from the damaged ship.
UHURA: And how do you expect us to rescue them when we're surrounded by Klingons?
KIRK: Alert medical.
MCCOY: Our ship is being hit shields at sixty I understand.
KIRK: I understand.
MCCOY: Should we at least, I dunno, fire back?
KIRK: Mmmm. no.
MCCOY: Of course not.
UHURA: ( perplexed, works the Kobayashi Maru is still in distress. but. the Klingons have stopped firing.
KIRK: Arm photons. Prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds.
MCCOY: Jim, their shields are up.
KIRK: Are they?
MCCOY: . no.
KIRK: Fire on all enemy ships one photon each should do let's not waste Target lock acquired on all warbirds
WEAPONS OFFICER: Target lock acquired on all warbirds
KIRK: Begin rescue of the stranded crew. So. We've eliminated all enemy ships, no one on board was injured and the successful rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew is
SPOCK: . I do not know.
ACADEMY PRESIDENT: James T. Kirk. Step forward.
KIRK: ( uncomfortable beat ) Yessir. I believe I have the right to face my accuser directly.
ACADEMY PRESIDENT: Step forward please. This is Commander Spock, one of our most distinguished graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru test for the last four years.
SPOCK: Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow managed to install and activate a sub- routine in the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test.
KIRK: Your point being?
ACADEMY PRESIDENT: In academic vernacular, you cheated.
KIRK: Respectfully. Define "cheating".
SPOCK: To deceive by trickery.
KIRK: Now let me ask you something I think we all know the answer to: the test is rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to be unwinnable.
ACADEMY PRESIDENT: Mr. Kirk, I don't see how the intent of the exam is relevant to these Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test itself is a cheat.
KIRK: Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test itself is a cheat.
SPOCK: Your argument precludes the possibility of a no-win scenario
KIRK: I don't believe in no-win scenarios
SPOCK: Then not only have you violated the rules, you've failed to understand the principle lesson.
KIRK: Please, enlighten me.
SPOCK: You, of all people should know, Cadet Kirk A captain cannot cheat death.
KIRK: "I of all people?"
SPOCK: Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had assumed command of his vessel before killed in action, did he not?
KIRK: How long did it take you to look that up?
SPOCK: How long did it take you to program the virus that allowed you to cheat?
KIRK: Maybe you just don't like that I beat your test.
SPOCK: I am Vulcan. "Like" is not a verb in our vernacular. I've simply made the logical deduction that you're a liar.
KIRK: What an idiot I am for taking that Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to divine the purpose of the test.
SPOCK: Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to divine the purpose of the test.
48A: 83 CONTINUED: ( 3 ) 83
KIRK: Enlighten me again.
SPOCK: The purpose is to experience fear. Fear in the face of certain death. To accept that fear and maintain command of one's self and one's crew. This is a quality expected in every Starfleet captain.
KIRK: So you're telling me the point. Of the whole thing. Is to be afraid?
SPOCK: Fear is necessary, yes.
KIRK: Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?
SPOCK: Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no additional training to control my narcissism when making command decisions.
KIRK: You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan. And I'm sure you're really proud of that, who wouldn't be but isn't it true you people don't experience fear at all?
ACADEMY PRESIDENT: ( to all ) We've received a distress call from ( Spock reacts concerned ) Cadet Kirk you are on academic probation pending the result of your hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle Hangar One immediately this hearing is at recess until further notice
PIKE: Cheating isn't winning.
KIRK: Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
MCCOY: I don't know, but I like him.
KIRK: Excuse me, you didn't call my name. Kirk, James T..
BARRACKS LEADER: ( checks his tablet ) You're on academic probation. That means you're grounded until the Academy Board
MCCOY: . Jim, the Board'll rule in your favor. Most likely. Look, Jim I gotta go
KIRK: . yeah yeah, you go. I'm good.
UHURA: Commander, a word?
SPOCK: Yes, Lieutenant?
UHURA: Was I not one of your top students?
SPOCK: Indeed you were
UHURA: Did I not receive a Gold rating for Exolinguistic skills, giving Starfleet first place over Kyoto and MIT at the Oxford Invitational?
SPOCK: An exceptional achievement, to be su
UHURA: and did I not, on multiple occasions, demonstrate exceptional aural sensitivity and, I quote, "unparalleled ability to identify sonic anomalies" in subspace transmission tests?!
SPOCK: Consistently, yes
UHURA: And while you were well aware that my unqualified desire was to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise, I was assigned to the
SPOCK: It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism.
UHURA: No. No. I am assigned to the
SPOCK: Oh. Yes, I believe you are.
KIRK: What are you doing?
MCCOY: Doing you a favor. I couldn't just leave you there, looking all pitiful roll up your sleeve, I'm gonna give you a vaccine against viral infection from Melvaran mud
WOOZY ): what'd you do to me? you're gonna get a really this is a favor?! yeah, you're welcome. McCoy ushers Kirk out of the room
SCANNING OFFICER: "Kirk, James T." he's not cleared for duty aboard the Enterprise
MCCOY: But I am, and Medical Code states the treatment and transport of a patient's to be determined at the discretion of his attending physician, which is me. You can see he's suffering, he needs me as his doctor, so since I'm assigned to this ship, so's he, or would you like to explain to Captain Pike why the Enterprise warped into a crisis without one of its medical officers?
SCANNING OFFICER: . as you were.
MCCOY: As you were.
KIRK: I might throw up on you.
MCCOY: You should look at this.
KIRK: Bones. Thanks for getting me on board. But I don't feel right. I feel like I'm Oh look, the pointy-eared bastard.

MCCOY: You need an antidote, Jim, or you're gonna die.
MCCOY: Jim, I'm not kidding, you gotta keep your heart rate down.
KIRK: Computer, locate crew member Uhura
MCCOY: I haven't seen a reaction this severe since Med school.
COMPUTER VOICE: Lieutenant Uhura is at signals monitoring station twelve deck four.
KIRK: We're flying into a trap.
MCCOY: You're delusional, you know that.
MCCOY: Come here Jim don't move
KIRK: ow! Stop it!
UHURA: What are you doing here what happened to your hands?!
KIRK: Who was it who escaped? What was the ship that was stolen?! what's happening to my mouth?

KIRK: Captain Pike Sir, we have to stop ship!
PIKE: Cadet Kirk, I think you've had enough attention for one day Dr. McCoy, return to medical, we'll have words
MCCOY: Rebuked, McCoy exits as:
KIRK: Fact: the same anomaly a lighting storm in space that we saw today also occurred on the day of my birth, before a Romulan ship attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin. You know that, I read your dissertation. Which was good.
PIKE: And you know of this prison escape how?
UHURA: Sir, I I intercepted and translated the message myself. Kirk's report is We're warping into a trap there are Romulans waiting for us, I promise you
KIRK: We're warping into a trap there are Romulans waiting for us, I promise you
SPOCK: The cadet's logic is sound. And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in xenolinguistics, we would be wise to accept her conclusion.
PIKE: ( to Comm Officer ) Scan Vulcan space, check if any transmissions are being made in Romulan.
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: Sir, I'm not sure I could distinguish the Romulan language from Vulcan.
PIKE: ( to Uhura ) How about you you speak Romulan, Uhura, Sir. All three dialects.
UHURA: Uhura, Sir. All three dialects.
PIKE: Uhura, relieve the Lieutenant Mr. Hannity, hail the U.S.S. Truman.
HANNITY: The other ships are out of warp and have arrived at Vulcan, Sir but we seem to have lost all contact
UHURA: Captain, I pick up no Romulan transmissions or transmissions of any kind in the area. There seems to be something jamming all communication around Vulcan.
KIRK: It's because they're being attacked. Captain. Please.
PIKE: ( long, tense beat ) Shields up. Ready all weapons.
SULU: Arrival at Vulcan in five seconds! Four. three. two
NERO: Destroy it, too.
SPOCK: Captain, they're locking torpedoes!
PIKE: Full reverse, come about Starboard ninety degrees! Drop us down underneath them! Prepare to fire all weapons!
SPACE: We see the ship from a distance the scale of the destruction relatively small
SULU: Shields at thirty-two percent! Their weapons are powerful, Sir, we can't take another hit like that!
PIKE: Get me Starfleet Command!
SPOCK: Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered some kind of high energy pulse device into the Vulcan atmosphere its signal appears to be blocking our communications and transporter abilities!
64A: 111 CONTINUED: 111

UHURA: Captain, we're being hailed!
NERO: I am Captain Christopher Pike, to whom am I speaking?
PIKE: I am Captain Christopher Pike, to whom am I speaking?
NERO: I am called Nero.
PIKE: You've declared war against the Federation. Withdraw, and I'll agree to arrange a conference with Romulan leadership at a neutral loca
NERO: I do not speak for the Empire. We stand apart. As does your Vulcan crew member. isn't that right? Spock?
SPOCK: ( to Nero ) Pardon me. But I don't believe you and I are acquainted.
NERO: . no, we're not. Not yet. I would like you to see something. Captain Pike your transporter capability is disabled. You will man a shuttle and come aboard the Narada for negotiations. That is all.
PIKE: I understand that I need officers who have been trained in advanced hand-to-hand combat!
SULU: I have training, Sir!
PIKE: Then come with me Kirk, you too you're not supposed to be here anyway. Radio the engine room, have Chief Engineer Olsen meet us at Shuttle Bay Aye, Keptin.
CHEKOV: Aye, Keptin.
PIKE: Let's go.
PIKE: Without transporters, we can't beam off the ship, can't assist Vulcan, can't do our job. I'm creating an opportunity: Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and Mr. Olson will space-jump from the shuttle. You'll have chutes you'll land on that machine they've lowered into the atmosphere that's scrambling our gear you'll get inside, disable that thing then beam back to the ship.
KIRK: . okay.
PIKE: Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in command of the ship. Once we have transport capability and communications back up, you'll contact Starfleet and report what the hell's happening here.
SPOCK: Captain. Please. I apologize, but the complexities of human pranks escape me.
PIKE: It's not a prank, Spock. And I'm not the Captain. You are.
KIRK: Once we knock out that machine. Sir, what happens to you?
PIKE: I guess you'll have to come get me. Careful with the ship. She's brand new.

The two FIGHT PRECARIOUSLY ON THE EDGE OF THE SWIRLING PLASMA DRILL, WIND ROARING and suddenly there's ANOTHER ROMULAN from an OPEN HATCH! SULU SLIDES DOWN THE CABLE - - JUMPING and tackling the second guard and the shit is ON: our Starfleet heroes battling these Romulans to the death and Sulu KICKS OFF AN ANTENNA PIECE and uses it as a SABER fucking swashbuckling at 10,000 feet! It's a frenzied assault even the bigger Romulan isn't ready for, and Sulu manages to KICK him into the vortex, where he's VAPORIZED as KIRK draws his PHASER and point-blank SHOOTS the Romulan, knocking him clear OFF the cylinder and into the sky, falling to his death, DISINTEGRATING as he falls Against pummeling wind, Kirk and Sulu move toward the HATCH OPEN IT as:

CHEKOV: . yessir.
SPOCK: How long does the planet have?
CHEKOV: . minutes, Sir. I'd say minutes.
SPOCK: ( beat, to Uhura ) Alert Vulcan Command Center to signal a planetwide evacuation all channels, all frequencies maintain standard orbit
UHURA: What? Spock, wait
SPOCK: To evacuate the Vulcan High Council they're tasked with protecting our cultural history. My parents will be among them
UHURA: you can't beam them out?
SPOCK: It's not possible they'll be in the Katrik Arc, I must get them myself
NERO: Retract the drill, let's move out!

UHURA: I'm so sorry.
SPOCK: . I need.
KIRK: ( she turns to him ) Listen, about what happened at Starfleet. The test and everything I know it looks like I was. using you, or whatever. And I'm sorry. I really am. And. I just hope you'll forgive me.
NOT GAILA: ( pissed ) ( nods )
KIRK: ( nods )
SPOCK: Lieutenant, have you confirmed that Nero is headed for Earth?
UHURA: Their trajectory suggests no other destination, Captain.
KIRK: Earth may be his next stop, but we have to assume every Federation planet's a Yes, agreed but why didn't they destroy
CHEKOV: Yes, agreed but why didn't they destroy
SULU: Why waste a weapon? We weren't a threat.
SPOCK: That's not it. He said he wanted me to see something. The destruction of my home planet.
MCCOY: And how the hell did they do that by the way? When did they jump so far ahead in the arms race?
SPOCK: The engineering comprehension necessary to artificially create a black hole may suggest the answer: such technology could theoretically be manipulated to create a tunnel through space time.
MCCOY: Damnit, man, I'm a doctor, not a physicist are you suggesting they're from the future?
KIRK: That is what he's suggesting and I don't buy it.
SPOCK: If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains however improbable must be the truth.
MCCOY: How poetic.
KIRK: Then what would an angry future Romulan want with Captain Pike?
SULU: As Admiral he knows details of Starfleet's defenses.
KIRK: What we need to do is catch up to that ship. Disable it, take it over and get Pike back.
82A: 153 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 153
MCCOY: ( bitingly ) Fantastic, I'm in.
SPOCK: Captain Pike left us with standing orders to rendezvous with the fleet on the other side of the quadrant.
KIRK: "Illogical" you're funny.
CHEKOV: Not to mention we couldn't do it anyway: Nero's ship would have to drop out of warp for us to overtake them
KIRK: what about assigning Engineering crews to try and boost our warp yield?
SPOCK: We must gather with the rest of Starfleet to balance the terms of our next There won't be a next engagement, Spock: by the time we've "gathered", it'll be too late how many planets are you willing to risk? You say he's from the future? Knows what's gonna happen? Then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.
KIRK: There won't be a next engagement, Spock: by the time we've "gathered", it'll be too late how many planets are you willing to risk? You say he's from the future? Knows what's gonna happen? Then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.
SPOCK: You're assuming Nero knows how events are predicted to unfold. The contrary: Nero's very presence has altered the flow of history, beginning with the attack on the U.S.S. Kelvin, culminating in the events of today thereby creating a new chain of incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party.
MCCOY: Does anyone understand him?
UHURA: ( stunned ) . an alternate reality.
SPOCK: Precisely. Whatever lives we might have lived, if the time continuum was disrupted. our destinies have changed. Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the Laurentian system, Warp Factor Three

PIKE: Christopher Pike Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise, registry NCC-1701.
NERO: ( beat; hardcore ) Answer my question.
PIKE: No. You answer for the genocide you just committed on a peaceful planet
NERO: I prevented genocide. Where I come from, Christopher. this ship is just a mining vessel. I chose a life of honest labor to provide for myself. and the wife who was carrying my child. I sit here now. knowing you as enemies. Not just of today. But of tomorrow. I watched as your Federation did nothing. They let us burn to death. as our planet broke in half.
PIKE: Then Nero, you're confused. Romulus has not been destroyed. How can you blame the Federation for something that hasn't It did happen. I remember it. I. felt When I lost her. I promised myself I would not speak another word until the day of my retribution. In twenty five years I forgot the sound of my own voice. but I didn't forget the pain. That feeling cannot be erased.

NERO: yes, which is a gift I won't waste on My purpose, Christopher, is not simply to avoid the destruction of the home I . but to create a Romulus which exists, free of the Federation. Only then will she be saved.
PIKE: Then we have nothing more to discuss.
NERO: It's not the fault of the human race that Starfleet chose Earth as its center. You're a more noble race than my fallen cousins. I'll take no pleasure in your How reassuring.

THIS THING IS SO MUCH WORSE! IT ROARS AS KIRK GETS TO HIS FEET AND RUNS, SCREAMING KIRK HAULS ASS AS THE THING COMES AFTER HIM THEN SUDDENLY HE FALLS DROPS and we see that Kirk is FALLING DOWN A MASSIVE SNOW MOUNTAIN! The huge red creature stops at the edge and ROARS LOUDLY until the ice shelf BREAKS AWAY! The creature starts to FALL AS WELL! Now Kirk is TUMBLING, the immense creature TUMBLING not far behind! And Kirk LANDS ON THE ICE, HARD sees a distant CAVE. Looks up at the FLAILING CREATURE that is about to CRUSH HIM Kirk tries to run, but the ice is TOO SLIPPERY FINALLY he gets footing and runs off toward the cave as the red creature LANDS HARD its sharp SPEAR LIMBS STAB into the ice as it pursues Kirk
FIGURE: The Hen-Gra. Notoriously afraid of heat.
KIRK: Hey. thank you.
SPOCK PRIME: . Jim?
KIRK: ( stunned ) how d'you know my name?
SPOCK PRIME: How did you find me? Does Starfleet know of my presence?
KIRK: HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?
SPOCK PRIME: I have been. and always shall be. your friend.
KIRK: no, I don't know you the only Vulcan I know isn't exactly a buddy.
SPOCK PRIME: You are James T. Kirk. Your father is George, as is your brother. Your mother's name is Winona you were born in 2233
KIRK: Stop. Please. I don't understand.
SPOCK PRIME: . I am Spock. One hundred and thirty years senior to the Vulcan you know.
KIRK: ( beat, beat, beat )
SPOCK PRIME: It's remarkably pleasing to see you . especially after the events of today.
KIRK: Old friend. Sir, I don't have any idea how you know what you know. But I don't know you and if you are Spock we're not friends. You hate me. You marooned me here for mutiny.
SPOCK PRIME: Mutiny? You are not the Captain?
KIRK: You're the captain. Pike was taken . by Nero.
SPOCK PRIME: ( realizing, grave ) . by Nero.
KIRK: What do you know about him?
SPOCK PRIME: ( guilty, burdened ) . he is a remarkably.
KIRK: What're you doing?
SPOCK PRIME: ( whispering; a mantra ) Our minds. one and together.One hundred and twenty-seven years from now everything ends.
KIRK: Nero's planet was destroyed
SPOCK PRIME: Yes. He of course blamed us. Believed Vulcan allowed his planet to die. Which was hardly the case. Let me continue.
THE HOLD: SPOCK PRIME ( V.O. )
SPOCK PRIME: Forgive me. emotional transference is an effect of the mind meld.
KIRK: ( sympathy, surprise ) . so you do feel.
SPOCK PRIME: "Cthia" is the stricture that binds our emotions. but few of us are that perfectly Vulcan.

SPOCK PRIME: Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here is not a matter of coincidence. but rather, indication of a higher purpose.
KIRK: . he'd call it a damn miracle.
SPOCK PRIME: Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's way of attempting to mend itself. In both our histories, the same crew found its way onto the same ship in a time of ultimate crisis therein lies our We must go there's a Starfleet outpost not far from here.

MCCOY: You wanted to see me?
SPOCK: ( discreet tone ) Yes, Doctor. I'm aware that James Kirk is a friend of yours. Supporting me, as you did, must have been difficult.
MCCOY: . are you thanking me?
SPOCK: I'm simply acknowledging your
MCCOY: Permission to speak freely, Sir.
SPOCK: I welcome it.
MCCOY: Do you. Okay then: are you out of your Vulcan mind? Were you doing the logical thing? Maybe. The right one? Debatable. But one thing's for damn sure that kid doesn't know how to lose. Just isn't in his DNA. Back home we have a saying: "If you're gonna ride in the Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize stallion in the stable."
SPOCK: . a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential.
MCCOY: My God, Man. you could at least act like it was a hard decision.
SPOCK: I intended to assist in the effort to re- establish communication with Starfleet. However, if crew morale would be better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I'll gladly defer to your medical
KIRK: I AM SO PISSED OFF AT THE OTHER YOU RIGHT
NOW!: And Spock POINTS an OUTPOST half a mile away.
KIRK: . hello?!
KEENSER: . can I help you?
SPOCK PRIME: Are you the station chief?
KEENSER: . no. This way.
STARFLEET OFFICER: A beat and the Officer peers from under his hat. A cool, slow burn.
KEENSER: A beat and the Officer peers from under his hat. A cool, slow burn.
STARFLEET OFFICER: You realize how unacceptable this is.
KIRK: Excuse me?
SPOCK PRIME: ( re: the Officer ) . Fascinating.
KIRK: Officer stands, unhappy about something. Keeser watches nearby
STARFLEET OFFICER: I'm sure it's no' your fault, and I know youse lads are just doing your jobs, but could you no' have come a wee bit Six months I've been living on nothing but Starfleet Protein Nibs and the promise of a real food delivery! Six months, boys! It's pretty clear what's going on here, isn't it? Punishment! Ongoing! For something that was clearly an accident!
SPOCK PRIME: You're Montgomery Scott.
KIRK: You know him?
SCOTTY: Yes, that's me Scotty you're in the right place are there any other hard- working and equally-starving Starfleet officers around?
KEENSER: You eat nothing. A bean and you're done for a week, I need food. And now you're here so. Thank you. Where is it.
SCOTTY: You eat nothing. A bean and you're done for a week, I need food. And now you're here so. Thank you. Where is it.
SPOCK PRIME: You are in fact the Mr. Scott who postulated the theory of trans-warp Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking about! How d'ya think I ended up here? I got into a debate with my instructor on the issue of Relativistic Physics as they pertain to subspace travel. He seemed to think that the range of transporting say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few hundred miles so I told my instructor I could not only beam a bird from one planet to an adjacent planet in the same system which is no big deal anyway but if I were so inclined I could actually do it with a lifeform! So I tested it on Admiral Archer's prize beagle. Which. was a mistake.
SCOTTY: Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking about! How d'ya think I ended up here? I got into a debate with my instructor on the issue of Relativistic Physics as they pertain to subspace travel. He seemed to think that the range of transporting say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few hundred miles so I told my instructor I could not only beam a bird from one planet to an adjacent planet in the same system which is no big deal anyway but if I were so inclined I could actually do it with a lifeform! So I tested it on Admiral Archer's prize beagle. Which. was a mistake.
KIRK: I know that dog. What happened to it?
SCOTTY: I'll tell ya when it reappears. Dunno. Feel guilty.
SPOCK PRIME: What if I told you your trans-warp theory was correct? That it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that is travelling at warp speed. And that you only required the correct field equation to recrystallize dilithium?
SCOTTY: I haven't been stationed here that long. If such an equation had been discovered, I'da heard.
SPOCK PRIME: The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr. Scott. is because you haven't discovered it yet.
SCOTTY: Y'from the future, are ya? Brilliant. D'they still have sandwiches where you're from? Piece and jam? Mince 'n tatties? Cockaleekie soup?
KIRK: What is he talking about?
KEENSER: SPOCK PRIME
SPOCK PRIME: Allow us access to your shuttle. and I will show you what a genius you actually
SCOTTY: She's a wee bit dodgy: shield emitters are totally banjaxed, along wi' a few other things.
SPOCK PRIME: Your equation for achieving trans-warp
SCOTTY: Imagine that! Never occurred to me to think of space as the part that's moving.
SPOCK PRIME: Point of fact: it did occur to you. Extrapolating Enterprise's course
SCOTTY: Enterprise? Had its maiden voyage already, has it? Well, you must've done something right to be assigned to that ship, Kiddo. She's a well endowed lady love to get my hands on her ample nacelles, if you'll pardon the engineering parlance.
SPOCK PRIME: Now's your chance, Mr. Scott.
SCOTTY: Look, even if I believed you where you're from, what I've done which I don't we're still talkin' bout slingshotting aboard while she's going faster than light. Without a proper receiving pad, that's like tryin'a hit a bullet with a smaller bullet, wearing a blindfold. On a horse.
SPOCK: I calculate no more than a four meter margin of error.
SCOTTY: That's all well and good unless you rematerialize four meters outside the
SPOCK PRIME: Agreed: the aft engineering bay is your best option: a large space and no unpredictable airlocks
KIRK: you're coming with us, right?
SPOCK PRIME: No, Jim. My destiny lies along a different path.
KIRK: You're telling me I can't tell you I'm following your own orders? Why not? What happens?
SPOCK PRIME: Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero, you alone must take command of your ship.
KIRK: How, over your dead body?
SPOCK PRIME: Preferably not. There is, however, Starfleet Regulation 619. Yes. I forget what little regard you had for such things. 619 states that any commanding officer who is emotionally compromised by the mission at hand. must resign said command.
KIRK: So I need to emotionally compromise you?
SPOCK PRIME: Jim. I just lost my planet. I can tell you. I am emotionally compromised. What you must do. is get me to show it.
KIRK: Aye, then. Live or die, Laddie, let's get this over with. he Enterprise has a decent cafeteria I'm guessing.
SCOTTY: Aye, then. Live or die, Laddie, let's get this over with. he Enterprise has a decent cafeteria I'm guessing.
KIRK: You know. coming back in time. changing history. that's cheating.
SPOCK PRIME: A trick I learned from an old friend.

KIRK: Well I'm not telling.
SPOCK: You are not a member of this ship's crew. Under penalty of court martial, I order you to explain to me how you beamed ab
KIRK: ( to Scotty ) Don't answer him.
SPOCK: You will answer me.
SCOTTY: I'd rather not take sides.
SPOCK: Escort them to the Brig.
KIRK: What is it about you, Spock? Your planet was just destroyed your mother murdered and you're not even upset?
SPOCK: Your presumption that these experiences interfere with my abilities to command this ship is inaccurate
KIRK: HA! And yet you said fear was necessary for command. I mean did you see that bastard's ship? Did you see what he did?
SPOCK: ( tense ) Yes, of course I
KIRK: So are you afraid or aren't you?!?
SPOCK: ( tenser ) I will not. allow you to lecture me about the merits of emotion.
KIRK: Then why don't you stop me.
SPOCK: Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.
KIRK: What is it like? Not to feel? Anger. Or heartbreak. Or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the death of the woman who gave birth to you?!
SPOCK: ( volcanic ) back away
KIRK: ( closer still ) You must not feel anything! It must not even compute for you! You must not have loved her at all!
SAREK: And everything everything STOPS. Spock, red-faced, releases his grip. Kirk GULPS air and tumbles to the ground. Spock staggers back. Kirk's hardly able to speak, close to collapsing. But despite his brutalized face, his expression isn't about spite, or hatred. but compassion. Spock sees the faces of the STUNNED CREW staring at him. But worst of all? Sarek. His father. Spock levels his chin. Quickly wipes his eyes. Trying to regain some semblance of dignity. looks to McCoy. Softly
SPOCK: Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I hereby relinquish my command on the grounds that I have been. emotionally compromised. Please note the time and date in the ship's log.
SCOTTY: I like this ship. It's exciting.
MCCOY: Congratulations, Jim. Now we've got no Captain and no first officer to goddamn replace him.

MCCOY: Even if we could, you can't go in guns blazing, not with their technology, that's suicide.
KIRK: Then we find a way to get on that ship and steal the black hole device away from Well you can forget transwarp. No way to predict the Narada's position from here.
SCOTTY: Well you can forget transwarp. No way to predict the Narada's position from here.
KIRK: Uhura: anything from Captain Pike?
UHURA: No. I've been monitoring all channels.
SAREK: You must not punish yourself. Speak your mind, Spock.
SPOCK: That would be unwise.
SAREK: What is necessary is always wise.
SPOCK: I feel as conflicted as I once was. As a child. Have I made so little progress?
SAREK: ( beat, softly ) You will always be a child of two worlds. I am grateful for that. And for you. ( painfully ) And not only because you are all I have left of her.
SPOCK: I feel anger. For the one who took her life. An anger I cannot stop.
SAREK: I believe she would say. do not try to. You asked me once. Why I married your I married her because I loved her.
CHEKOV: Keptin Kirk? Excuse me, plees, could
I.?: All eyes shift to the wonder-kid who awaits permission to speak:
KIRK: Yes, Chekov you don't need to ask permission to
CHEKOV: Based on the Narada's course from Vulcan, I've projected that Nero will travel past Saturn. If we could drop out of warp behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan, the magnetic distortion from the planet's rings will make us invisible to Nero's sensors. We could follow him to Earth by staying in his blind spot.
KIRK: What blind spot?
CHEKOV: Its exhaust wake. If we adjust our shield frequencies, they shouldn't detect Wait a minute anyone understand this kid? How old are you?
MCCOY: Wait a minute anyone understand this kid? How old are you?
CHEKOV: I am seventeen, Sir, how old are you?
MCCOY: We're all old enough to shave here.
KIRK: I won't order you to do that, Mr. Spock.
SPOCK: Romulans and Vulcans share a common ancestry. Our cultural similarities will make it easier for me to access their ship's computer to locate the device.

SPOCK: ( beat, considering ) I would cite regulation, but I know you will simply ignore it.

NERO: There is no need, Ayel. To threaten me. I understand.
SULU: Mr. Chekov, transfer manual control to the Captain's chair.
CHEKOV: ( works controls ) I've projected the parabolic course you must follow. If you deviate by so much as a meter, we will be detected.
SULU: Give me one quarter impulse burst for five seconds and I'll do the rest with thrusters. On my mark. Three. two. one. fire.
SULU: All stop in three. two. one.
CHEKOV: ( scanning ) No sign they've detected us
SCOTTY: ( on Communicator ) Well done, Mr. Sulu.
KIRK: Whatever happens Mr. Sulu, if you feel you have a tactical advantage fire on that ship. Even if we're still aboard. It's an order.
SULU: Yessir. Good luck.
UHURA: We'll be monitoring your frequency.
SPOCK: Thank you, Nyota.
KIRK: Her first name is.
SPOCK: I have no comment on the matter.

SPOCK PRIME: I am not. our father.
SPOCK: . Fascinating.
SPOCK PRIME: There are so few Vulcans left. We cannot afford to ignore each other.
SPOCK: Then why did you send Kirk aboard when you alone could've explained the truth?
SPOCK PRIME: ( beat, simply ) Because you needed each other. Opposing yet complimentary opposites. It was that balance between us I should say you and Kirk that often made the impossible, possible.
SPOCK: . it was a test?
SPOCK PRIME: ( no: his heart heavy ) I'm in no position to pass judgment. my actions have robbed you of much. I could not also deprive you the revelation of all you can accomplish together. of a friendship that will define you both in ways you cannot yet realize.
