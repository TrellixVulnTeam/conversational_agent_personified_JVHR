NARRATOR: Everyone's got that one summer when they were a kid. a summer so perfect, that it stays with them forever. It stays caught in time, like Camelot. pause That summer is like a book with a million blank pages that you get to fill with the greatest story you could ever dream up.
THE BABE: hits a homerun. Settles into his signature, locomotive basepath chug.
NARRATOR: Fourteen years later, after The Babe was gone, there was another guy who had something to do with the legend getting made too. A guy who set a record that summer that was so awesome, some people still don't believe it.
UMPIRE: WILLS' CLEAT becomes
THE PITCHER: cranks one deep to right. He tears around the bases like lightning ( this kid is real fast ). He rounds 3rd. The ball comes in home - cutting him off. He's caught in a pickle.
BENNY: cranks one deep to right. He tears around the bases like lightning ( this kid is real fast ). He rounds 3rd. The ball comes in home - cutting him off. He's caught in a pickle.
FROM: BEHIND THE CHAIN-LINK BACKSTOP YEAH-YEAH, HAM, DeNUNEZ, REPEAT, TIMMY, BERTRAM and SQUINTS come unglued and crowd the basepath.
HAM: pickles the CATCHER and 3RD BASEMAN. He feints n' rubba-legs them out of position. He sprints for home. Safe! Just as he crosses home plate
PICKLE!: pickles the CATCHER and 3RD BASEMAN. He feints n' rubba-legs them out of position. He sprints for home. Safe! Just as he crosses home plate
BENNY: pickles the CATCHER and 3RD BASEMAN. He feints n' rubba-legs them out of position. He sprints for home. Safe! Just as he crosses home plate
SQUINTS: pulls his transistor radio ear plug out.
SQUINTS: Thirty-one! Maury Wills just stole number thirty-one!
OTHER TEAM: ( ABOUT BENNY )
SQUINTS: Game over. Sixteen zip. Murderers' Row remains undefeated.
OPPONENT: Hey! We never got our ups!
SCOTTY SMALLS: has been watching nearby.
HAM: Great, I'm dyin' a thirst and you pee me out!
BENNY: Ham, it ain't really.
HAM: Then switch with me.
BENNY: Do I look stupid?
NARRATOR: I moved to the neighborhood about a month before school let out. I was from another state, and didn't have a single friend in a thousand miles.
SCOTTY'S: caught in the mayhem.
HE SPIES: the 8 guys forging ahead. He follows them.
NARRATOR: It was a lousy way to end up the 5th grade, 'cause I had zip time to make friends before summer. And that's about where it all started.
OUTFIELD OF: EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY The gang's homemade baseball diamond. They're:
SCOTTY: maintains cover and
SCOTTY: remains undercover, but he's bustin' to join in.
THE GANG: never notices him. As they work:
HAM: Fifth grade's history, man. A hundred days, man. A Hundred days of baseball. All Day, everyday, as much as we can. That's the best.
TIMMY: We got all summer.
REPEAT: We got all summer.
BENNY: Let's play.
NARRATOR: Everyone but the Timmons twins lived on my new block.
THE BLOCK: clears to empty. The street lamps arc on, drawing soft white circles on the sidewalks. FROM THIS HEIGHT, they look like baseballs dotting the neighborhood.
NARRATOR: .later, it would become second only to Cape Canaveral as a command post for history.
BENNY'S: in bed, oiling his glove, staring out his window at Scotty's house. Taped to his footboard is the most important picture of all. a picture of The Babe.
SWITCHES ON: THE CONTRAPTION
THE CONTRAPTION: a tiny scoopelvator snatches up a white marble. Drops it on a roller coaster track. The marble whips around corners and
THE MARBLE: leaps a little green fence and WONK! Ouuuhhh! beans
BEDROOM: Scotty winces at the shot.
SCOTTY: Sorry, Mom.
MOM: I thought we agreed we'd take this apart. and not spend so much time in I know - but it's just nighttime.
SCOTTY: ( FEELING LOW )
MOM: Scotty, have you made any friends yet?
SCOTTY: Why not, honey?
MOM: Why not, honey?
SCOTTY: 'Cause I'm still "new."
MOM: Honey, I don't want you sitting in here all summer fiddling with this stuff, like you did last summer. and the one before that.
SCOTTY: None mothers I guess.
MOM: I want you to make friends this summer, Scotty. Lots of them.
SCOTTY: I know, but I don't - I'm no good at anything. Face it, Mom, I'm just an
MOM: - and you'll always be just an egghead with an attitude like that. So promise me, alright?
SCOTTY: Maybe tomorrow you'll make some friends.
MOM: Maybe tomorrow you'll make some friends.
SCOTTY: Yeah, maybe tomorrow.
MOM: Are you kidding, he'd love it, you know what an athlete he wasIn high You know what a pitcher he was in high INT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Scotty slurps a glass of chocolate Quick. Rinses the glass too carefully. Gathers courage for something. Breathes deep - starts across the house.
NARRATOR: My real dad died when I was just a little kid. My mom married Bill a year before we moved to the At the time, he and I were still getting used to each other.
SCOTTY: Um, Dad - sorry, I mean Bill, remember you promised you'd teach me to play Um hum.
BILL: Um hum.
SCOTTY: Well, could you teach me?
BILL: He places a pitching plaque. Scotty waits awkwardly. Waits for more words. They don't come.
SCOTTY: Okay. Great. Thanks.
BILL: Um hum.
HE GLIMPSES: Ham, at the HELMS BAKERY TRUCK, buying a donut, then scrambling around the far corner.
HAM: Hey-hey, come on! Wait up - wait up!
SCOTTY: panics. Runs back inside and.
CLOSET: finding a vinyl, "toy" baseball glove. It's still in the package, with a note attached: "To Scotty Boy - Love, Grandma!" It's all he's got. He shovels through a pair of Mickey Mouse ears - a cowboy hat - finds the closest thing he's got to a baseball cap. a long, duck-billed fishing cap with a big embroidered trout.
THE HOUSE: with the fiberglass panels out back. Scary place.
IN: DEEP LEFT FIELD where he hugs the perimeter, moving slowly toward the sandlot common houses. Winded, Scotty finds
THE GANG'S: already playing "over the line."
NARRATOR: They never kept score. They never chose sides. They never even really stopped playing the game. it just went on forever. Everyday they picked up right where they left off the day before. It was an endless "dream game."
SCOTTY: watches and listens ( as he goes ) to the SHARP, satisfying sound of the hardball, SNAPPING CLEANLY in the oily leather of their gloves.
SCOTTY: continues around the perimeter, trying to be seen and become invisible. He goes unwittingly CLOSER TO those green fiberglass panels.
DENUNEZ: winds up and pitches to
BENNY: who connects big. CRACK!
SCOTTY'S: come too close to the green fence. Something has overcome him. fear! He stares with serious woollies at
SCOTTY: whips a look up and sees
SCOTTY: tracks it, frozen stiff. Scared shitless. At the past possible moment, he throws his arms over his face and ducks. social suicide.
THE BALL: beans him at the glove covering his noggin.
SCOTTY: hits his butt. The ball rolls a bit. Comes to an "I-dare- you" stop: right up against the diseased fiberglass panels of that preternatural fence. Scotty pulls his arms away from his face.
THE GANG: LAUGHS uproariously.
TIMMY: Nice catch!
REPEAT: Nice catch!
HAM: Hey! Throw the ball back!
BERTRAM: We gotta a game here, man!
SCOTTY: moves for the ball. As he goes, he sweats:
SCOTTY: 'Kay, I'll get it!
SCOTTY: who snatches up the ball and back-pedals 10 feet.
SQUINTS: WE'RE WAITING. He throws back the ball. And his chances of getting in with these guys are over. Because Scotty. throws like a girl!
THE BALL: droops forward in the air. Lands 6 feet from him. Rolls slowly up to the gang, finally coming to a dainty stop at DeNunez' feet.
THE GANG: looks from the ball to Scotty. they CRACK UP!
SCOTTY: walks away. crying.
SCOTTY: ( TO HIMSELF )
BENNY: is the only one that isn't laughing. He stares the others
DENUNEZ: Come on, Benny-man, didn't you see that throw?
HAM: ( TRULY STUNNED )
SQUINTS: I seen a guy once that threw like that. I mean not that bad, but at least so bad that he hadda move in the fourth grade 'cause they nicknamed him Benny's look stifles the bunch.
BENNY: I bet not one of you knows how The Babe got his nickname.
HAM: Easy, 'cause of the way he looked like a little kid face.
BERTRAM: Bull, it's just 'cause he liked kids and stuff.
SQUINTS: Wrong. The Babe was called The Babe, because he was like the child of Yankee I knew it. You're all full of crap. George Herman Ruth got his nickname because his mom died when he was just a little kid, and he hadda go live in an orphanage.
BENNY: I knew it. You're all full of crap. George Herman Ruth got his nickname because his mom died when he was just a little kid, and he hadda go live in an orphanage.
NARRATOR: Everyone knew Benny was different. Nobody ever voted or anything, but he was the leader.
THE MOON: is up. Full. Like a big baseball.
NARRATOR: Even though he seemed like a regular guy, he wasn't. Benny was special, and he was loyal.
NARRATOR: So, the only person that ever felt sorry for me 'cause I was such a weenie was Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez.
SCOTTY: Scotty picks up his bowl and cereal, goes into
MOM: ( QUIETLY )
SCOTTY: He's too busy, Mom.
MOM: ( ENCOURAGING )
SCOTTY: Um, Da -
BILL: Um, yeah, but later, okay? I gotta get this done.
SCOTTY: Okay, thanks.
MOM: Bill, can't you take a break and teach him now?
SCOTTY: Mom, it's okay -
BILL: Honey, I said I would and I will. I'm just under the gun here, ya know?
SCOTTY: Mom, really -
MOM: - How long could it take? You can't spare a half hour to show him?
BILL: ( ANNOYED )
MOM: ( CLUELESS )
SCOTTY: stands ready to "learn" on the other side of the yard. Appropriately pitiful in "trout" cap and toy glove.
BACKYARD: Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up where it goes. Okay?
BILL: Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up where it goes. Okay?
SCOTTY: Yeah, okay, I think so.
BILL: That's alright, just throw it back.
SCOTTY: He runs back across the yard. Turns 'round again. Holds his glove up stiffly.
BILL: Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up where the ball goes.
SCOTTY: Darn. My glove got -
BILL: - not bad. Right side at least. Now, just throw it back this time.
SCOTTY: But my glove -
BILL: ( DISBELIEF )
BENNY'S POV: up the side of Scotty's house into the backyard. He can see Scotty. Only Scotty. Standing there game as hell, trying to catch balls that seem to be coming too fast. The ball comes. Scotty ducks. The ball hits the block wall behind him, caroming back toward where we assume Bill is throwing from.
BENNY'S: drawing the wrong conclusion.
BILL: Alright, Scott, listen, this one's gonna come right at you, easy, okay?
SCOTTY: Just keep your eye on the ball and put your glove up. You'll catch it.
BILL: Just keep your eye on the ball and put your glove up. You'll catch it.
SCOTTY: THE BALL
BILL: THE BALL
THE BALL: comes slowly forward.
SCOTTY: sticks his glove up.
SCOTTY'S EYES: THE BALL
THE BALL: hits dead center glove. Rips the "toy" webbing. Flies through
AND CLOUTS: right in the eye.
SCOTTY: right in the eye.
BILL: Oh my -
BILL: Oh my -
BENNY: - God, whadda jerk!
MOM: Bill! What happened?!
BILL: Well, he -
SCOTTY: ( PRIDE'S SAKE )
BILL: There. Keep that on for an hour. It'll still be black, but it won't Sorry. We'll try again soon.
BENNY'S: on the curb across the street. A moment goes by. Benny raises a hand.
SCOTTY: slowly waves back.
BOTH: Benny comes over to Scotty's sidewalk.
BENNY: Gonna go play some ball. Need a extra guy. Wanna go?
SCOTTY: Naw. Thanks.
BENNY: Why not? Doncha like baseball?
SCOTTY: Oh. Yeah. But, ah.
BENNY: But what?
SCOTTY: But my glove's busted. So, ya know, I can't go. Thanks, though.
BENNY: That's okay.
SCOTTY: Mom! I'm gonna go play some ball!
BENNY: Yeah. Cool shiner. We gotta stop by the 5 & 10 first. Need a new ball. And chaw and stuff, ya know?
SCOTTY: You dip chaw?
BENNY: You dip chaw?
SCOTTY: ( COMPLETELY CLUELESS )
HAM: Hey! Check me out! I'm the Great Bambino!
SCOTTY: ( OVER EAGER )
HAM: ( BEYOND HIM )
BERTRAM: Were you born in a barn, man?
SQUINTS: You never heard of The Sultan of Swat?!
DENUNEZ: The Titan of Terror!
TIMMY: The Colossus of Clout!
REPEAT: The Colossus of Clout!
BENNY: ( even he's amazed ) The King of Krash!
NARRATOR: I had no idea who they were talking about. But there was no way I could let them know that. so, I lied.
SCOTTY: Oh! The Great Bambino! Of course. I thought you said The Great Bambi.
HAM: ( SHIVERING )
SCOTTY: Ah, yeah - I guess. Sorry.
BENNY: ( W/MOUHTFUL )
SCOTTY: The gang just stares.
BENNY: He's gonna play with us. He makes nine. Now we got a team.
BERTRAM: Why'd you bring him for, Benny?
BENNY: 'Cause there's eight of us, and he makes nine.
BERTRAM: Yeah, so would my sister, but I didn't bring her!
BENNY: With nine Guys we got a whole team.
HAM: No, with Elswenger we had a whole team, and Elswenger could throw!
DENUNEZ: He ain't game, Benny. He can't throw for nothin'.
TIMMY: Benny, you already play all the empty positions since Elswenger moved to And now I get to rotate 8 positions instead of 7. I need the practice.
BENNY: And now I get to rotate 8 positions instead of 7. I need the practice.
SQUINTS: No you don't. It's stupid, Benny. The kid's an L-7 weenie.
BENNY: Oh yeah, Squints, and you're Willie freakin' Mays. You catch like a dork - anybody ever bust your chops about No, but I'm - ya know, I'm -
SQUINTS: ( PALTRY EXCUSE )
BENNY: - and you run like a duck, Yeah- Yeah.
BENNY: - part-a the game.
SQUINTS: ( DEFENSIVE )
BENNY: How come he don't get to be?
THE GANG: hits the field. Their suspicious glares aren't lost on
SCOTTY: standing off by himself, kinda lost. Benny comes over.
SCOTTY: ( EAGER ) ( SURPRISED )
BENNY: ( SURPRISED )
BENNY: takes home plate worried: "Maybe the kid is a weenie."
INFIELD: DeNunez at the mound. Benny's up.
SCOTTY: who raises the glove, and skippers around, as if he were tracking a falling leaf. The ball lands 5 feet behind him.
THE GANG: shakes its collective head, exasperated.
SCOTTY: runs to the ball, is about to throw. runs it in to DeNunez
SCOTTY: Here. Sorry, sorry.
THE GANG: is stunned.
SCOTTY: runs back to right field. Ready again - a game kid.
BENNY: trots out after him.
BENNY: Hey, you can throw it ya know.
SCOTTY: No, I can't. I don't know how.
BENNY: You think too much. I bet you get straight A's and shit, huh?
SCOTTY: No, I got a B once. Actually it was an A minus.
BENNY: This is baseball, you're not supposed to think, you're just supposed to play.
SCOTTY: Uh, I helped a guy one time.
BENNY: Throw it like you chuck a paper. When your arm gets here. just let go of Just let go.
SCOTTY: Wait - how do I catch it?
BENNY: Don't worry. Just stand there and stick your glove in the air. I'll take care of it.
HOME PLATE: Benny mentally calculates the distance. Puts a little rub on the ball. Flips it into the air.
SCOTTY: sees it coming. Stands there stiffly. Sticks his glove up, closes his eyes.
SCOTTY: Please, catch it. Please, catch it. Please, ca -
BERTRAM: catches it good and solid at 1st.
BERTRAM: Okay! Hey, let's play ball!
SCOTTY: loosens up. From home plate
BENNY: gives him a "Thumbs Up." The significance of this is only outweighed by his sudden fear, when.
SCOTTY: glimpses something.
SCOTTY'S POV: of some great, lumbering thing moving past a crack in those green fiberglass panels.
SCOTTY: Already at his door, Benny just raises his glove in answer.
BENNY: Keep it.
SCOTTY: tags it. The ball sails over
SQUINTS': Head in center. From left field
BENNY: gives Scotty another "Thumbs Up." The kid's in.
NARRATOR: Everyday, first thing, we'd all pick a card from what we called "The Dugout."
BENNY: Bingo! Maury Wills!
SCOTTY: Mickey Mou - ah, Mantle.
DENUNEZ: Stan Musial.
TIMMY: Lou Brock.
REPEAT: Lou Brock - I mean, Luis Aparicio.
BERTRAM: Frank Robinson.
SQUINTS: Oh. Bob Uecker.
HAM: Hank Aaron. I'm up.
HAM: ( at home plate ) mercilessly.
DENUNEZ: pitches - strike. Pitches again - strike. Delivers and
HAM: takes a Ruthian cut at it. CONNECTS to deep right.
SCOTTY: tracks it.
THE BALL: comes down.
SCOTTY: runs beneath it - glove up.
THE BALL: drops into a backyard. The one with the green fiberglass stops short. Looks back to
SCOTTY: stops short. Looks back to
THE GANG: who're already packing up in slumped dejection.
SCOTTY: makes a decision. Swallows against fear of the fence. He takes one step toward that fence.
SCOTTY: Wait a sec, I'll get it!
THE GANG: comes unglued.
GANG: NOOOOOOOOOO! STOPPPPPP! They rush over - grab Scotty - pull him back 10 feet into the "Fear-Free" zone.
NOOOOOOOOOO! STOPPPPPP!: They rush over - grab Scotty - pull him back 10 feet into the "Fear-Free" zone.
SQUINTS: Holy crap, you coulda been killed!
SCOTTY: Well, you were all leavin', so I thought I'd just -
SQUINTS: - if you were thinkin' you wouldn't a thought that!
BENNY: You can't go back there, Smalls.
SCOTTY: Then how do we get the ball?
TIMMY: We don't.
REPEAT: We don't.
BERTRAM: It's gone.
HAM: Forever even.
DENUNEZ: Forget it, it's a memory.
BENNY: Game's over. We'll get a new one tomorrow. Just forget it. We'll never see it again.
SCOTTY: Why not?
GANG: ( HUSHED )
BENNY: Go over there, real slow, and be quiet. Don't touch the fence, just peek through that hole in the green stuff. go on.
SCOTTY: draws his eye close to the hole in the fence. WE SEE
SCOTTY: Something got the ball!
GANG: EXT. TIMMONS' BACKYARD - NIGHT Aglow. ( NOTE: Same as Sc. 80 )
HAM: Wanna s'more?
SCOTTY: Some more of what?
HAM: No. You wanna s'more?
SCOTTY: I haven't had anything yet, so how can I have any more of nothing?
HAM: You kill me Smalls. Look, these are s'mores stuff. Pay attention:
SQUINTS: Alright, listen up.
DENUNEZ: - Bull, Squints!
BENNY: You did, man.
SQUINTS: When Yeah-Yeah heard it he peed his Shut up, Squints - did not!
HAM: You did, man.
SQUINTS: And when The Ham heard it he barfed up two bags of marshmallows.
HAM: Liar! It was only one.
SQUINTS: So stay away from the door. you might fall out. And don't sit on your sleeping bag. you could shit your Now, quiet.
OLD APPLIANCES: that form tortured faces in the shadowy recesses.
OTHER STUFF: like savaged shopping carts. A school bus graveyard. Scrap motorbikes. Cargo ship buoy balls. The gutted shell of a fighter plane.
AN EYEBALL: among a pile of broken headlights. As big as the headlights.
ANOTHER THIEF: suddenly enveloped by a shadow. He's dragged into darkness. he SCREAMS.
MR. MERTLE: leads the The Beast on a huge chain. ( NOTE: We only see bits of The Beast. )
A CRANE: lowers a giant bathtub into the backyard. FIREMEN fill it with water.
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS: sink an I-Beam girder. Cement fills the chasm.
MR. MERTLE: contructs a huge lean-to from old bullet-holed, tin-ad signs.
A WELDER: Braises chain to the girder.
MR. MERTLE: "collars" The Beast with the other end.
THE BEAST: disappears beneath the lean-to. DUST EXPLODES from underneath as he lies down.
BERTRAM'S: eyes are shut tight, his bottom lip shudders.
BENNY: sitting shattered. He checks his pants to see if he's peed them. His mallow's a briquette. It SPUTTERS and flames out.
SCOTTY'S: sitting shattered. He checks his pants to see if he's peed them. His mallow's a briquette. It SPUTTERS and flames out.
SQUINTS: is proud of his story prowess.
SQUINTS: And so. The Beast sits there under that lean-to, dreaming about the time when he can break the chain and get out. dreaming of the time when he can chase and kill again.
THE GANG: See, man. That's why you can't go over there. Nobody ever has. Nobody ever will.
BERTRAM: See, man. That's why you can't go over there. Nobody ever has. Nobody ever will.
HAM: One kid did, but nobody ever seen him That ain't true -
DENUNEZ: That ain't true -
HAM: - yeah it is! He got eaten!
DENUNEZ: "Boogers" Fleming?
TIMMY: No. It was that guy with the warts on his face.
REPEAT: Davy "The Toad."
TIMMY: That's what I said.
SQUINTS: Davy "The Toad" Stodenrous.
BERTRAM: Yeah, The Toad.
SCOTTY: ( WEAK )
SQUINTS: - oh, yeah?. Come here. Stick your head out the window and look down.
SCOTTY: hears the ORGANIC EXHAUST that accompanies the dust. rising and falling. in POWERFUL EXHALATIONS.
SCOTTY: ( HUSHED )
SQUINTS: You bet he is.
HAM: Whatever goes over that fence. stays It becomes the property of The Beast. EXT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT ( NOTE: Same as Sc. 54 ) FROM THE SANDLOT. a FULL MOON hangs ominously over the tree house; a glowing little box of debate in the scary night.
SQUINTS: It becomes the property of The Beast. EXT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT ( NOTE: Same as Sc. 54 ) FROM THE SANDLOT. a FULL MOON hangs ominously over the tree house; a glowing little box of debate in the scary night.
NARRATOR: I learned that more than a 150 baseballs had gone over that fence. and not one of them was ever seen again. Even when some brave kid worked up enough courage to peek over the fence.
WHILE: spits into his palm and rubs the ball to get the shine off. His eyes go suddenly wide and he stares, and oggles, and gawks:
SQUINTS: spits into his palm and rubs the ball to get the shine off. His eyes go suddenly wide and he stares, and oggles, and gawks:
SQUINTS: can only manage a totally embarrassing goofy grin.
BENNY: What took you so long?! We been here forever already!
SQUINTS: Shut up, I wasn't!
SQUINTS: Hold me back! Hold me back!
HAM: I am holdin' you back Squints.
SQUINTS: Oh, yeah. Well, lemme go then.
DENUNEZ: So, where'd you get the money this time Yeah-Yeah?
HAM: What-what?! I'll take it back. I know it was crappy, but I didn't have no money, I -
BENNY: - naw, don't, man. He's just mad he didn't think of it.
HAM: Yeah, you know how many lawns I hadda mow when it was my turn?! Geez. Let's crests the sandlot. it's gonna be a hot one.
THE SUN: crests the sandlot. it's gonna be a hot one.
DENUNEZ: spits a 'zooka sploink that SIZZLES when it hits.
THE GANG: simultaneously heads for the bleachers. Everybody but Benny.
HAM: I can't take it no more, Benny. I'm bakin' like a toasted cheeser!
TIMMY: It's hotter than the fires of hell.
REPEAT: It's hotter than a fish in a fryin' The brothers "look" at each other on the miscue.
BENNY: Come on, don't be wimpy.
SQUINTS: Face it, Benny. It's not a fit day out for man nor beast. We gotta call it for the day.
BENNY: Vote then. Everyone that wants to be a can't-hack-it panty waist, and wear their momma's bra, raise your hand.
GANG: Scam Pool Honeys!
THE GANG: rushes out in cut-off shorts, and banzais the shallow end. Ham leaps over the water like a graceful Manatee.
HAM: KERSPLASH! A Ham-tsunami SLOSHES the Coppertone'd bods of
POOL HONEYS: They're up and SCREAMING at him.
NARRATOR: Benny would've played ball all day and all night. rain shine, tidal wave, whatever, it didn't matter. Baseball was the only thing he cared about and everything else was just a waste of But, of all the things we ever did besides baseball, goin' to the pool was what he tolerated best. Even though none of us had ever seen a Playboy magazine - which we constantly lied about - we figured the pool was the next best thing to being there.
THE GANG: dunks each other, play "attack-sub," etc.
THE LIFEGUARD: is unbelievable. In fact, it's WENDY PEFFERCORN. She slides Coppertone up and down her legs.
THE GANG: one by one, stop foolin' around. Chest deep in the shallow end, they're a detached and frozen pocket of leering dopes. The OTHER 80 KIDS in the pool play on around them.
SQUINTS: is suddenly afflicted.
THE LIFEGUARD: oils up and down.
THE GANG: gawks on. ( Cool Hand Luke scene ):
BENNY: Oh, man.
TIMMY: She don't know what she's doing.
REPEAT: She don't know what she's doing.
BENNY: Yeah she does. She knows exactly what she's doing.
SQUINTS: I've swum here every summer of my adult life. and every summer there she is.
SCOTTY: What's wrong with him?
SQUINTS: walks the plank to the end. Looks wantingly toward
THE LIFEGUARD: who smiles back at him.
SQUINTS: holds his nose. Takes the deep leap. Hits the water and.
UNDERWATER: .sinks like a stone. Squints grins as he founders.
THE GANG: lines the edge of the deep section.
BERTRAM: Oh my God! He's drowning!
HAM: Oh my God! He's drowning!
THE LIFEGUARD: to the rescue. Seconds pass. she surfaces and lays a limp
SQUINTS: ON THE DECK Everybody at the pool gathers 'round. The Lifeguard lays Squints flat. She administers mouth-to-mouth.
LIFEGUARD: You little pervert!
HAM: Did you plan that?!
SQUINTS: A'course I did. Been plannin' it for They let Squints walk out front:
NARRATOR: Michael "Squints" Palledorous walked a little taller that day. And we had to tip our hats to him. He was lucky she hadn't beat the crap out of him. We wouldn't have blamed her. What he'd done was sneaky, rotten and low.
BENNY: jolts a high fly to
SCOTTY: in right field. No problem now. He backpedals, judging.
CLOSER TO: MR. MERTLE'S FENCE then, SNATCH! Scotty makes a clean catch.
BENNY: gives Scotty "Thumbs Up." Just as
SCOTTY'S: gonna throw the ball back, he shivers, noticing that the sun has fallen to a precise declination; its rays focused behind the glowing green fiberglass of
THE GANG'S: here with 100 OTHER BOYS at the afternoon show.
HAM: Eee! Eee! Eee! Oh! Oh! Oh!
A GROUP: of other kids comes out behind them. LITTLE LEAGUERS. Matching caps and shirts. The gang straightens up.
HAM: Shut up, blockhead.
BENNY: Play us and you'll find out why, Forget it, we play real ball, not with toy bats and sneakers!
SQUINTS: Benny, man, are we gonna let 'em get away with that?!
BENNY: Yeah. For now. Let's go.
SCOTTY: You think he really died in the end?
BENNY: King Kong.
SCOTTY: King Kong.
SQUINTS: Not possible. He's so big that fallin' off the Empire State's just like us fallin' off a roof. he's alive.
SCOTTY: So whadda you think happened to him?
TIMMY: Most likely.
SCOTTY: Hey, guys? Has anyone ever really seen The Beast?
SQUINTS: Look, Smalls. You ever seen King Kong for real? In person, I mean?
SCOTTY: No. But -
SQUINTS: - well, he's real right?
SCOTTY: Yeah, a'course.
SQUINTS: And he's still out there somewhere See, there's just somethings that are. Ya know, stuff that it's better not to talk about. 'cause thinkin' about it just makes it worse.
SCOTTY: See, there's just somethings that are. Ya know, stuff that it's better not to talk about. 'cause thinkin' about it just makes it worse.
SQUINTS: See, there's just somethings that are. Ya know, stuff that it's better not to talk about. 'cause thinkin' about it just makes it worse.
SCOTTY: ( HORRIFIED THOUGHT )
GANG: King Kong? Naw! God is that stupid! No stinkin' way! Oh boy, had me feelin' like a douf there for a minute! Whew, what a relief!

DENUNEZ: I dunno, Benny-man.
SQUINTS: He ain't gonna buy that, Benny. It doesn't look anything like the Babe's It doesn't matter what it looks like. His mom's never gonna know the difference. This'll just buy us some time, ya dorks.

SCOTTY: So, how do we get it back?
SQUINTS: I have no idea.
NARRATOR: I was dead meat. I knew it. They knew it. We had thought that those cards Benny had gotten meant that something great was going to happen. Now I figured that they'd just meant my life was over.

HAM: Remember Davy Stodenrous.
SCOTTY: Oh, yeah. I forgot.
SQUINTS: Are you outta your mind?! Mr. Mertle is the meanest old man that ever lived! He's the one that sicked The Beast on The Toad!

SQUINTS: We need to assess the situation!
GANG: ( better than nothing ) Of course! Right! Good one, Squints! Access ( sic ) the situation! Okay!
BERTRAM: Um, Squints? How do we do that?
SQUINTS: First we survey the enemy's environment, then we make note of the surrounding I heard that on "Combat." Let's just look out the window.
HAM: ( COPPING )
SQUINTS: ( COPPING )
THE YARD: is the final resting place for: melted frisbees, withered kickballs, skeletons of heat-crumbled paper kites, an airforce of exposure-splintered balsa wood gliders, and a fleet of model rockets - their drag-chutes turning to dust. And hundreds of little empty craters - that used to cradle THE RUSTY TOW CHAIN snakes through the dirt - buried then exposed. It terminates

BERTRAM: Think he's pissed?
BENNY: Is Doby Gillis a dork? Anybody got any bright ideas?
NARRATOR: We had absolutely no idea what the hell we were gonna do. So things started primitively.

SQUINTS: Yeah-Yeah! Get hold of yourself! What'd you see?!
HAM: - somebody slap him quick! We're losin' WHAP-WHAP! Squints administers. Yeah-Yeah snaps out of it.
BENNY: Sorry, Smalls. It was a good idea Yeah, tough luck, Smalls.
DENUNEZ: Yeah, tough luck, Smalls.
HAM: It won't be that bad, Smalls. Your dad'll probably only shoot you or Hey-hey, don't blame me! I didn't hit the ball over there, man!
BENNY: Here. Put these on.
BENNY: Oh, ah, nuthin', ya know, just For, ah. Altitude leveling And stuff. Put it on.

SQUINTS: That thing with the nuts and bolts and tiny wrenches that you can build junk out of?
SCOTTY: Never heard of it.
SQUINTS: Never heard of it.
HAM: I used to have one when I was like I dunno, a little kid.

THE STRUCTURE: comes tumbling down - bending into flimsy knots as it CRASHES!
NARRATOR: My life was over. Just as Bill had finally warmed up to me, and asked me to be the man of the house, I had to knock a priceless chunk of history into the clutches of a monster. Great.
BENNY: We can't get it back, Babe.
THE BABE: Now don't go peeing your pants or nuthin', I'm just here to give ya a The Great Bambino PUFFS on a massive stogie. the source of all the smoke.

THE BABE: What kind?
BENNY: A giant gorilla-dog-thing that ate one kid already.
THE BABE: Is that a fact? Listen to me, kid.
BENNY: Sure, yeah, five Maury Wills all in the same pack.
THE BABE: What're the odds on that?
BENNY: About a zillion to one.
THE BABE: More even. Someone's tellin' you somethin', kid. And if I was you. I'd listen.
BENNY: Yeah, but what?

THE BABE: Lemme tell you something. you remember that called shot homer I hit?
BENNY: Sure, the greatest most famous and legendary home run of all time.
THE BABE: Yeah, right, well said.
BENNY: Sure ya did, Babe.
THE BABE: Not a chance. Matter of fact, all the way down to first I kept sayin' to myself, "you lucky bum."
BENNY: ( WITH PURPOSE )
SCOTTY: Benny - wait. It's okay, it was my fault. I'll just take whatever I get. You don't have to do this.
BENNY: ( PREDESTINED )

DUST RISES: from thereunder. ORGANIC EXHAUST. The LAZY CLINKS of heavy chain links. The Beast is rising to its feet.
IT MATERIALIZES: piece by piece: fore feet the size of a catcher's mitt, bulking head and shoulders, hulking flank and haunches.
BENNY'S: mouth hangs open. He's frozen, staring at
THE BEAST: and it's worse than Squints recounted. because it's real. This is the biggest dog that ever lived! 300 lbs. 4 1/2 feet tall. And ugly. This was a bad idea. The Beast lingers 8 feet away with slack in the chain.
STOPS EXACTLY: BETWEEN THEM A PICKLE
BETWEEN THEM: A goo-slobbered ball. Dirty Beast-foam drips off, revealing the smeared signature, B A B E R U T H. "G'head kid, I dare Benny measures The Beast. Times its ballooning chest.

THE BEAST'S: knotted muscles quaver and UNCOIL.
BENNY'S: P.F. Flyers leave behind tiny dust roosters.
THE BEAST'S: claws dig deep furrows. FOG BANKS of dust spread out behind it. Forelegs gallop at flared, over-anxious angles.
BENNY: leaves scrambling footprints. He slides - grabs the ball - "Pops-Up" Maury Wills fashion - heads back for the fence. The ball slips from Benny's fingers. Re-grabs it - shoves the ball in his teeth, freeing his hands for the leap up the gains. SHNAPP! Jaws SHUT like a tripped bear trap.
THE BEAST: gains. SHNAPP! Jaws SHUT like a tripped bear trap.
BENNY: springs off the ground. He's on the fence.
THE BEAST: reaches chain's end - it goes taught. Breaks! The two foot length still attached to The Beast's neck bullwhips - the chain catches Benny in the butt.
BENNY: He vaults over the fence.

THE BEAST: rages after him, through:
BENNY: rips into the square. He rubba-leg zigzags, nimbly avoiding everything and everyone.
THE BEAST: Is a runaway freight train. He PLOWS through CLOWNS. CHILDREN are snatched from the dog's path by terrified parents. The Beast tears through the concession stands:
BENNY: zips through the MARCHING BAND - ducking trombone slides - leaping glockenspiels.
THE BEAST: ain't so graceful. He "barn-doors" the band. CRASH! An instrument tangled heap.
THE ONLOOKERS: pour into the street, knocking the MAYOR from his convertible, and the FOUNDER'S DAY QUEEN from her float.
BENNY: SHOOTS BY:
BENNY: Benny's gone. Seconds later - The Beast follows.
SQUINTS: This way! Shortcut!
THE GANG: forges through the disaster.
THE BEAST'S: muscles flex.
BENNY: just runs. He runs as if a big dog was chasing him. He lurches a step - RIP! A pants pocket flaps from an incisor.
BENNY: LOOK OUT! He lays down the world's all-time most perfect SLIDE. He careens toward the bottom of

THE BEAST: is hanging from the fence. His chain has caught. He struggles - choking to death - right below Scotty.
THE GANG: petrifies where they stand.

SCOTTY: Pick him up! Scoot him up so I can let him off!
COME ON!: moves. They wanna but they can't!
NOBODY: moves. They wanna but they can't!
SCOTTY: goes for broke. He reaches out and puts his hand on The Beast's head.
THE BEAST: whimpers. Scotty balances atop the fence. Grabs the tow chain. Lifts with all his might. his fingers bleed. The Beast goes limp. An inch. That did it! The beast falls.
SCOTTY: goes with him - 8 feet to the dirt. The FENCE COMES DOWN - breaking the barrier to the sandlot. He lands on the ground
SCOTTY: leaps to his feet.
THE BEAST: rises with him.
SCOTTY: freezes solid.
THE GANG: watches in horror.

THE BEAST: sticks his mammoth head right in Scotty's face. SNIFFS. That's it! The kid is lunch! His jowls part - hot BEAST-BREATH BLOWS Scotty's hair back.
SCOTTY: closes his eyes.
THE GANG: SLAP their hands to their eyesockets.
THE BEAST: leans closer. Mouth opens. Cold-leather nose presses against Scotty's forehead. Then. He licks Scotty's face.
SCOTTY: wipes away the Beast slob. He doesn't even have to kneel down to read the name on The Beast's "doggy tag." It says.
THE GANG: steps closer. Look into the hole. Their faces light up with wonder. In
THE HOLE: Are 150 baseballs.

MR. MERTLE: - why didn't you just come to the door. I'd have gotten it for you.
