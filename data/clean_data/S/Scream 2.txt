SNOTTY GUY: Sequels suck. Hello. It becomes about: money and no one's interested in quality.
DEREK: It's more than that. Horror films are only as good as their villains. How can Freddie and Jason possibly be scary after they've been diluted through five or six sequels.
TEACHER: What's the solution? If you were making a sequel today what would you do differently?
SNOTTY GUY: The point is - I made my point. Sequels suck.

GALE: I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
DEWEY: No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.

TORI: Yeah, but your mom left town. She's not dead. My mom's dead. Do you hear me? She's dead. Dead. And she's never coming back. Ever,
DEREK: My documentary is due on Tuesday.
MICKEY: What's your subject?
DEREK: I WAS A SORORITY SLUT. You should of done it on Sidney. That would have been a cool.
JOEL: You should of done it on Sidney. That would have been a cool.
DEREK: She wouldn't let me.
MICKEY: Not with Primetime Live and 20/20 coming at her. I'd save my shit
DEREK: Where's Sid?
HALLIE: Damned if I know. She ditched me.
DEREK: You weren't supposed to leave her I didn't say she was alone. That guy - from her home town showed up. They went off together.
HALLIE: I didn't say she was alone. That guy - from her home town showed up. They went off together.
MICKEY: I've been waiting for you, baby.
JOEL: Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
HALLIE: She's got guards with her.
DEREK: What guy?
HALLIE: Randy somebody.
JOEL: Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
MICKEY: Her old boyfriend?
JOEL: No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend.
MICKEY: Watch out, Derek.
HALLIE: He tried to kill her first.
MICKEY: Is Sid in therapy?
JOEL: She was for a while. Gave it up.
DEREK: How do you know so much about her?
JOEL: I read the book.
MICKEY: I could use some therapy.
DEREK: Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
HALLIE: He seemed harmless.
DEREK: Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
JOEL: And white.
MICKEY: Easy black boy.
JOEL: It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive - slightly off white males in their twenties.
HALLIE: That's you, honey.
MICKEY: I got a surprise for you.
HALLIE: Suddenly, he leaps up on the cafeteria table and begins to sing at the top of his lungs.
MICKEY: "If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way.
HALLIE: Don't do this.
MICKEY: "And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you."
JOEL: ( to Derek ) I think he's doing Dolly.
DEREK: I think he's doing Dolly.
MICKEY: "And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
DEREK: Definitely Whitney.
JOEL: Isn't that a big no-no?
DEREK: I think so.
HALLIE: You're going to get it. You know what happens.
MICKEY: But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
ON SCREEN: It's the end of the movie. Tori Spelling is running for her life from two killers - Johnny Depp and his sidekick. She finds herself trapped in the kitchen. Johnny Depp holds the knife up to Tori's face.
TORI: Why did you kill my mother?
JOHNNY: Because she was sleeping with my dad. She's the reason my mom left. She was a whore just like you.
ON SCREEN: My mom was no whore. Don't you say Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore!
TORI: My mom was no whore. Don't you say Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore!
JOHHNY: Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore!
ON SCREEN: Johnny Depp and his murderous sidekick start stabbing each other.
SIDEKICK: Just like in the movies.
VOICE: Hello Sidney.
SIDNEY: Can we talk?
COTTON: Can we talk?
SIDNEY: I don't think that's a good idea.
COTTON: Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
SIDNEY: What do you want from me, Cotton?
COTTON: You could start with an apology.
SIDNEY: I did that.
COTTON: You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
SIDNEY: How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life - how do I apologize for that?
COTTON: I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become.
SIDNEY: Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
COTTON: I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
SIDNEY: Did it?
COTTON: It helped me realize one thing.
SIDNEY: You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
COTTON: You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
RANDY: You okay?
SIDNEY: I don't know. I don't think Cotton did it. It's too predictable.
RANDY: If he's innocent he'll have an I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
SIDNEY: I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
RANDY: I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
SIDNEY: I have this button I press. See? It insulates me.
RANDY: I gotta coupla of those buttons
SIDNEY: Thanks for the movie, Randy.
RANDY: Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that
DEREK: I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
SIDNEY: No, it's not.
DEREK: I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
SIDNEY: It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
DEREK: Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
SIDNEY: I'm sorry, Derek.
GALE: ( on phone ) The interview's not going to happen. 1 changed my mind. I've harassed the girl enough. It's in poor taste and a bad idea.
GALE: Gotta go, call me when you have something nice to say.
DEWEY: So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
GALE: Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
DEWEY: You're a hard one to figure out.
GALE: It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
DEWEY: I think you're all an act.
GALE: And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
DEWEY: I know that.
GALE: I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with - I'm guessing balding, older men - have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and

GALE: And where did you gain all of your Gale Weather's insight?
DEWEY: After my spinal cord was damaged I was laid up for over a year. A lot can happen when you're on your What'd I miss?
RANDY: What'd I miss?
GALE: I'm not here.
RANDY: MAN'S VOICE
MAN'S VOICE: She's not here right now.
RANDY: She's not here right now.
MAN'S VOICE: But she's standing right next to
GALE: ( to Randy ) Keep him talking.
ON RANDY: He holds the phone, scared, not knowing what to say?
RANDY: So. what's your favorite scary movie? No response. Silence.
MAN'S VOICE: They'll never find me.
RANDY: What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
MAN'S VOICE: What's your favorite scary movie?
RANDY: SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess.
MAN'S VOICE: Closer than you think.
GALE: He has to be nearby. He likes the
RANDY: So what's your deal? Can we talk openly for a second? How does one become a serial killer? Huh? Are you psychopathic or merely psychotic? And what is the distinguishing feature'? Were you slapped around as a child? Is it hereditary? Did your Mom take test drugs? You know, have you tried getting laid? It's done wonders for my homicidal tendencies.
MAN'S VOICE: Do you want to die?
RANDY: Gee, let me think. "Do you want to. " Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
DEWEY: It's okay. C'mon, Gale.
RANDY: And if you're such a brilliant smart killer - why copycat? Why not be original? Where's the innovation? Let's pioneer some new ground. Make a statement. Go down in history. Now you'll always be the Woodsboro copycat killer. That's lame. It's like a bad sequel. And why Woodsboro? What about Manson, Bundy, Son of Sam? Why imitate two high school loser- ass dickheads - 1 knew the guys. Stu was a wussy ass wet rag and Billy - jesus - what a rat-looking homo-repressed, mama's boy.
GALE: Randy? Randy? Where did he go?
SHERIFF: He's broken his pattern.
CAPTAIN TYLER: They've broken their pattern.
SHERIFF: You're sure about this two person Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
CAPTAIN TYLER: Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
SHERIFF: I would say we are now officially On national television.
CAPTAIN TYLER: On national television.
ON SIDNEY: Confused, she tries to make it stop but it won't. She leans back, turning to the GUY next to her. A handsome young man.
SIDNEY: Excuse me? Did your computer just
SIDNEY: I'm not signed on.
GUY: Someone here in the room. All the terminals are connected.
SIDNEY: He's here. He's in the room right
LATER: Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley are drilling a very subdued and cool Cotton.
COTTON: What better alibi could I have? I was here in custody.
CAPTAIN TYLER: Maybe you don't work alone.
COTTON: Yeah, that's it.
SHERIFF: Why did you attack Sidney Prescott?
COTTON: There was no attack, we were talking. Very heatedly. Miss Prescott and I have a very complicated past. That's no crime.
CAPTAIN TYLER: And the gun?
COTTON: I have a permit. It's registered. I have a legal right to carry it.
SHERIFF: Why do you need a gun?
COTTON: Gentlemen, your growing hysteria is not reason enough to hold me here. I've been down this road before. And unless you're going to charge me with a crime I'd like to walk outta here. I have an interview at
GALE: Where's Sidney'?
DEWEY: She's safe.
GALE: Not good. How you doin?
DEWEY: Not good.
DEWEY: Can't we hold him?
CAPTAIN TYLER: No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
DEWEY: What now?
ON COTTON: He stands at a counter, signing forms. Gale approaches.
GALE: What's going on, Cotton?
COTTON: You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
GALE: Did you do it?
COTTON: Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
GALE: You have a right to be angry.
COTTON: No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
GALE: Cotton, I've done nothing but help You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
COTTON: You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
GALE: Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
COTTON: Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
CAPTAIN TYLER: Night's coming. I think its time to beef up security on the Prescott Where is she?
GALE: Where is she?
SHERIFF: She was just escorted to her dorm Is she safe there?
DEWEY: Is she safe there?
CAPTAIN TYLER: We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
DEWEY: That doesn't work, sir.
GALE: You're just isolating people. You're giving the killer a blank
LOIS: It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but.
MURPHY: . we only promote safe rubbered . it's really about family and . harmonica style is okay.
LOIS: . it's really about family and . harmonica style is okay.
MURPHY: . harmonica style is okay.
LOIS: I just love being a sister.
DEREK: Thanks, ladies.
MICKEY: Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
DEREK: Not one bit.
MICKEY: Where's Sid?
DEREK: She dumped me.
MICKEY: No way.
DEREK: You freakin?
MICKEY: You freakin?
FRATERNITY JOCK: He lavaliered. He's dead.
EBERT: ( from TV ) I enjoyed its clever execution.
HALLIE: We're missing the Sig Ep party.
SIDNEY: No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
HALLIE: No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
SISKEL: ( from TV ) It was just an excuse to kill young, big breasted girls. I didn't like it.
SIDNEY: Someone else has been killed.
MICKEY: Who stands buck naked, tied. chained to a tree in the back yard. The yard is crowded with FRAT BOYS and SORORITY GIRLS who delight in torching him. Mounds of syrup, eggs, and other wet and slimy food is plunged upon him.
FRATERNITY JOCK: Who do you love?
MICKEY: FRATERNITY JOCK
FRATERNITY JOCK: Did you say "My TKE brothers"?
MICKEY: No, I said Hallie.
SIDNEY: I'm fine. I wish people would stop treating me like glass. I'm not gonna break.
HALLIE: It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
SIDNEY: I'd really just like to be alone.
DEWEY: The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere Dewey, there's no such place.
SIDNEY: Dewey, there's no such place.
DEWEY: Humor me, Sid.
HALLIE: Can I come with her?
SIDNEY: No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
GALE: Sid, I'll come with you.
SIDNEY: But who would operate your camera?
JOEL: They got Mickey. He's being toasted at the Deltas.
HALLIE: I knew it. Shit! I gotta get over We're under quarantine.
JOEL: We're under quarantine.
HALLIE: I'm the only one who can cut him It's not a good idea, Hallie.
SIDNEY: It's not a good idea, Hallie.
JOEL: I'll go with her.
HALLIE: Be safe, girl.
DEWEY: Sid, you should get going.
JOEL: ( instant cover ) Hallie forgot her footage at the film dept. I'm gonna walk her over before it's gets too late
DEWEY: You really.
HALLIE: I gotta have it, Dewey.
GALE: Hey, Dewey?
HALLIE: Seeya, Dewey.
GALE: If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
DEWEY: He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
GALE: He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
DEWEY: Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
GALE: Billy had alibis too.
DEWEY: Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
SIDNEY: Sidney's exterior keeps hardening.
MICKEY: ( whispering ) Come on, Hallie, baby.
GALE: ( checking door ) You broke the lock.
DEWEY: You broke my heart.
GALE: What are we looking for?
DEWEY: A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
GALE: Can we turn the light on?
DEWEY: That's not the way it's done.
DEWEY: And it's sexier in the dark.
GALE: Dewey, you and I would never make Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am.
DEWEY: Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am.
GALE: . and as lonely as I am.
DEWEY: We'd break some furniture.
GALE: Tell you what. We get through this one. And we'll take out a hotel room. Over here with the light.
DEWEY: They're roomates.
GALE: And Joel's pre-med.
DEWEY: The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
GALE: Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on - they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new
DEWEY: A moment. Then in a splash, they're outta there.
SIDNEY: Where are you taking me?
SIDNEY: I feel like Eddie Murphy.
CREAK!: Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the.
FRONT SEAT: Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move.
HONK!: Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the car door open and starts to slide completely over the Ghost when she stops.
BAM!: Sid hits the pavement hard. She lifts herself up when her entire body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS.
GALE: Ssshh! What was that?
DEWEY: Let's find out.
GALE: This is all too familiar.
DEWEY: Over here.
GALE: Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
DEWEY: C'mon. Let's go.
GALE: Jesus Christ!
DEWEY: He filmed his victims.
GALE: Dewey spins around. He reaches for the gun he no longer He looks around the room, up to the two levels above them. He spots a small light on the second level. He squints his eyes and sees a FIGURE standing behind it.
DEWEY: He looks around the room, up to the two levels above them. He spots a small light on the second level. He squints his eyes and sees a FIGURE standing behind it.
GALE: Let's go.
DEWEY: No, wait here.
GALE: No, Dewey, let's call for backup.
GALE: There's nothing. I'm coming down.
DEWEY: There's nothing. I'm coming down.
THE GHOST: Who stands right behind her. Dewey looks down to see the Ghost standing directly behind Gale.
DOWN BELOW: Gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's knife as it darts out of the darkness. Gale catapults, just dodging it. She moves like lightning up the aisle of seats.
UP ABOVE: Dewey races for the stairs, going as fast as his handicapped leg will allow.
DOWN BELOW: Gale tears out the exit door, the Killer right behind AT THE LECTURN Dewey arrives, searching, looking for Gale.
GHOST FIGURE: That stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS. She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the control booth. She's protected by a clear, large, plexiglass window that wraps around the room. The ghost moves out the side door, heading her way. He disappears out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying to secure it. There's no lock.
DEWEY: Gale! Gale!
GALE: ( through tears )
NOOOOOOO!: Dewey's body slides down, out of view. Gale is mortified. She looks to the Killer who has already made his way through the control booth. He's coming for her. She races to the door, throws the things away.
THE HALLWAY: Gale shoots down it.
SIDNEY: Sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound porch, beating at the windows. But nothing. Everybody is off partying. Suddenly, Sid hears something. A WHIMPERING. She turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying, strewn across the end of the porch. Passed out.
SOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY!: Sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound porch, beating at the windows. But nothing. Everybody is off partying. Suddenly, Sid hears something. A WHIMPERING. She turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying, strewn across the end of the porch. Passed out.
MICKEY: Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
SIDNEY: Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
MICKEY: What are you talking about?
SIDNEY: He's after me.
MICKEY: Shit! You've got to cut me down,
SIDNEY: I'll be right back.
MICKEY: Where you going?
SIDNEY: Watch out.
MICKEY: Do it again.
SIDNEY: Don't panic.
MICKEY: Sid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready. Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost, catching his mid-section, sending him flying.
SIDNEYWATCHOUT!: Sid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready. Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost, catching his mid-section, sending him flying.
SIDNEY: Sidney distracts the Ghost. She takes off, the Ghost following her. She moves around the tree, sprinting across the yard, running smack into.
MICKEY: Run, Sid.
SIDNEY: But Hallie doesn't hear her. Sid races forward.
VOICE: ( from phone ) What is your emergency please?
GALE: Someone's trying to kill me. I need the police.
VOICE: Are you in danger now?
GALE: Yes, goddammit!
VOICE: Where is your attacker?
GALE: I don't know.
VOICE: Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
GALE: The safety what? Fuck that!
GALE: But Sidney has already disappeared inside. Gale yells into the phone.
SIDNEY!: But Sidney has already disappeared inside. Gale yells into the phone.
SIDNEY: The stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the furniture from the DEATHTRAP set. BUMP! A noise from the stage wings.
DRIP! DRIP!: Something drips down from above and onto Sidney. She wipes it from her face when.
DEWEY: Who hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very much deadk, arms outstretched, crucified. His body a bloody mess. Sidney stops, stunned. She stands frozen in unspeakable horror. Her entire being ripped apart. She breaks into tears. And then.
HALLIE: Strung up, her body hanging lifeless. Sid SCREAMS, turning, running to the other side of the stage when a third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled set of DEATHTRAP.
CLAPPING!: A single pair of hands from somewhere in the house. applauding. She turns around and spots a FIGURE moving down the aisle. She can't make out who it is.
COTTON: Quick, untie me.
VOICE: ( from behind video camera ) You've seen this movie before, haven't you?
DEREK: He smiles at her.
DEREK: Smile for the camera.
COTTON: Sid, c'mon.
DEREK: Go on, untie him.
SIDNEY: No. This is a set up.
DEREK: That's quick.
COTTON: Please, Sidney, he's going to kill
DEREK: You must be dealing with some serious trust issues right about
COTTON: Please, Sidney.
DEREK: You're really stumped, aren't you? You know there's two killers but you don't know who they are. I'm a given. The boyfriend. Way obvious. But now you're torn. Everyone else appears to be dead. Except for Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm?
HALLIE: Paaaaiiin. yah, such pain. The story of your life, Sid.
DEREK: Need some help, honey.
HALLIE: I got it..
DEREK: You should really see your face right now, Sid. It's doing some freaky shit.
HALLIE: Yeah, you look quizzical yet Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
DEREK: Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
SIDNEY: Good question. You took the bait.
DEREK: Good question. You took the bait.
HALLIE: Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
DEREK: I really don't like that comparison, honey.
HALLIE: ( to Sid ) He hates Oliver Stone.
DEREK: I find his work overwrought.
HALLIE: C'mon, Sid, don't fade on us. We've been planning this baby for a year. Humor us.
DEREK: Nope. You had your chance.
GALE: She moves down along the theatre to another door.
DEREK: We met on the internet.
HALLIE: He sent me the cutest e-mail.
DEREK: I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line.
HALLIE: We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
DEREK: You'd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It's a whole world, Sid. You're really popular amongst the demented.
HALLIE: You're the one who got away.
DEREK: Until now.
COTTON: You guys are fucked.
HALLIE: Actually Cotton, and I think critics would agree, it's the other way around.
DEREK: Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
SIDNEY: You're not going to get away with Of course not. Who wants to? What's the point if we don't get caught? Where's the glamour in that?
HALLIE: Of course not. Who wants to? What's the point if we don't get caught? Where's the glamour in that?
DEREK: The way I see it. We'll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
HALLIE: A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
DEREK: We're hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
HALLIE: And now, drum roll please.
DEREK: Hope you're ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
HALLIE: A twist ending if you will.
DEREK: Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing's been done.
HALLIE: . so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the And we didn't want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money's So we found a compromise.
DEREK: And we didn't want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money's So we found a compromise.
HALLIE: So we found a compromise.
DEREK: Or it found us.
HALLIE: We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
DEREK: Just for you, Sid.
HALLIE: Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to
DEREK: Oh yeah. We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It's been an ongoing discussion. Heads or tails?
HALLIE: He flips the coin.
DEREK: Shit! You win.
GALE: ON STAGE They all turn, spotting Gale. Sid moves forward, happy to see her.
ON STAGE: They all turn, spotting Gale. Sid moves forward, happy to see her.
SIDNEY: IN THE AUDITORIUM Gale moves down the aisle, not sure what's going on.
ON STAGE: Sidney moves down center. Derek cuts her off just as.
ON STAGE: Derek grabs Sidney, holding her, the knife at her
HALLIE: It's about time she showed up.
DEBBIE SALT: standing, lips pursed.
DEBBIE SALT: Hello, Gale, we've been waiting for
SIDNEY: Okay, look, you guys - I applaud your methodical expertise but I have a question. What's going to happen after I die? I thought the heroine is supposed to live.
HALLIE: Not this time.
DEREK: Yeah, we're trying to send a message to Hollywood. I'm really getting tired of all the happy endings. It's just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
SIDNEY: But nobody wants to see that. It'll never go. They'll rewrite you. You don't want that.
HALLIE: Oh, Sid, you're sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one You fucking freaked out movie nut Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies don't create pyschos.
SIDNEY: You fucking freaked out movie nut Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies don't create pyschos.
VOICE: ( off camera ) Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies don't create pyschos.
DEBBIE SALT: Don't you know that by now? It's about family. It all starts at home. It starts with the father. and the mother.
SIDNEY: Mrs. Loomis?
GALE: Oh my God.
SIDNEY: Oh my God.
GALE: Jesus. It can't be.
HALLIE: Told you we had a guest star. Didn't see that coming, did you?
DEREK: Everything's taken on a hyper- reality, hasn't it?
GALE: You're Billy's mother?
DEBBIE SALT: I couldn't believe you didn't recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
GALE: You're all in this together?
DEREK: We had to have financing.
HALLIE: Tuition's expensive.
SIDNEY: Why Mrs. Loomis?
DEBBIE SALT: Where should we start? Your mother ruined my marriage by sleeping with my husband. You ruined my family by killing my son. Gale aired it to the world. Should I go on. isn't that enough?
GALE: Jesus, you're just as whacked as your son.
DEBBIE SALT: Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
DEREK: Yeah, she's been great, Sid. We never would have been able to it without her.
DEBBIE SALT: And I couldn't have done it without you two. Now who won the coin toss?
HALLIE: I did.
DEREK: What are you.
DEBBIE SALT: Nice kids but a little out there.
GALE: What are you going to do?
DEBBIE SALT: Finish what my son started.
GALE: But you'll never get away with it.
DEBBIE SALT: Enter Cotton Weary.
COTTON: No. not again.
DEBBIE SALT: Sorry, Cotton. I guess you were just meant to be a killer.
SIDNEY: You'll never get away with this.
DEBBIE SALT: Who would you like to shoot first,
GALE: Thank God.
COTTON: Gale gives him a hug.
GALE: Thank you.
SIDNEY: Cotton moves to Derek's body where the video camera lay, he pulls the tape from it.
NOOO!: Cotton moves to Derek's body where the video camera lay, he pulls the tape from it.
COTTON: It's perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I'm the victim.
SIDNEY: Please, Cotton, don't do this.
COTTON: I get my revenge and make some fast It's over, Cotton.
SIDNEY: It's over, Cotton.
COTTON: Not until you're dead.
BACKSTAGE: Sid runs to the rear of the stage. She moves in the narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back wail. She races down it.
SCRIM!: Sidney ducks, bypassing him. She comes to the stage door. It's locked. She turns, seeing the metal ladder that's attached to the wall. It leads to the catwalk Sid goes for it. She climbs up the ladder with lightning speed.
