WEINER: Whoa, whoa, whoa. what's that? With a WHOOSH, the WINDOW EXPLODES, showering the TWO with shards of GLASS, and throwing them to the floor.
OCK: ( rising ) We begin again. let's kick in that new transducer. See if we can double the power output.
WEINER: ( rising more slowly ) Whoa, Doc. wait a minute. But OCK is already at the THROTTLE. The cyclotron whirls up. The lights go on. Louder, brighter than before. OCK looks through the broken WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. The POWER DIAL inches upward, "eight, nine." the BLUE-WHITE LIGHT is blinding now. The WHINE pitch is END OPENING CREDITS. Okey. dokey! The POWER DIAL hits ten.
OCK: Okey. dokey! The POWER DIAL hits ten.
LIZ: ( falling in step ) Hiya Peter. LIZ ALLEN is also a senior. She's beautiful and ( ardent but uncomfortable ) Hiya Liz. how're you doing.?
PETER: ( ardent but uncomfortable ) Hiya Liz. how're you doing.?
LIZ: ( teasing softly ) How'm I doing what?
HARRY: Peter! Peter! Wait up! HARRY is the school nerd. A quirky kid who, like PETER, can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty ones like Liz.
HARRY: ( to Liz ) Would you, uh. excuse us for a minute? Despite PETER'S protesting body language, HARRY pulls him away like a conspirator.
PETER: What is it? what.
HARRY: Did the Astro-Physics Journal really accept your paper?
PETER: ( laughs, embarrassed ) Yeah. well. all I got's the data but they've agreed to publish it when it's finished. You know. it's my calculation on the Planetary Conjunction.
HARRY: And its influence on the anti-force. Isn't it?
PETER: Yes. Look, Harry, I am busy with.
HARRY: Yeah, you and the rest of the class. Every one is busy with Liz.
LIZ: ( growing impatient ) A HAND reaches in and smacks her bottom.
FLASH: Hiya, cupcakes.
LIZ: ( elbowing him affectionately ) They kiss and walk away.
HARRY: ( sneering ) And Flash is the busiest of them all.
PETER: ( disappointed ) Come on, Harry. we'll be late for HARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy.
HARRY: Ock is nuts, don't you agree?
PETER: Ock is a genius, Harry. Crazy, Yes! But, a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated.
ROZ: ( knocking furiously ) Doctor Octavius! You are late for your lecture. The students are waiting. Doctor Octavius!
THORKEL: Your friend is impossible Professor Rosomorf, I told the board we should let him go. The LIGHT above THORKEL's head EXPLODES. Then all the LIGHTS behind him EXPLODE in succession. THORKEL and ROZ look amazed.
THORKEL: What's he doing in there, not his crazy experiment again.
ROZ: You mean his anti-force theory. one day they'll give him the Nobel Prize for it.
THORKEL: Meanwhile he is demolishing our university. Octavius!! Open the door.
OCK: The anti-force experiment has now reached the limit of electronic overload safety. Therefore, Weiner, you will disconnect the overload safety device. FOUR WALDOS ( three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms ) suddenly thrust themselves into the CHAMBER and begin working, each at a different task. OCK is an acknowledged master at manipulating these WALDOS. He flicks a switch and a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM lances down from a FOCUSING CONE and strikes a GRAM WEIGHT marked, "1,000,000" ), illuminating it and filling our ears with a splitting BUZZ TONE. The knock on the door grows louder. WEINER comes up behind OCK.
WEINER: Whoa, Doc. someone's at the door.
OCK: ( ignoring ) World class scientific mind and they stick me in the basement with this third rate cyclotron. INSERT: The DIAL marked "RELATIVE GRAVITY" reads "1,000,000" but suddenly it snaps to "0.999999!"
OCK: Okey! Dokey! The WEIGHT begins to jiggle and, for an instant, it appears to lift ever so slightly.
LIZ: ( softly ) What is it, Peter?
PETER: ( embarrassed ) It's nothing.
WEINER: Yes, gentleman can I help you?
THORKEL: Tell your boss, that his class is waiting.
WEINER: ( looks ) You better tell him yourself. THORKEL looks at ROZ who waves his shoulder, then the both Professor Octavius!! Professor OCK turns and looks at the bewildered men.
OCK: Gentlemen, come, you must see this.
ROZ: But, your students.
OCK: The imbeciles can wait. I have better things to do than teach introductory Physics Rosomorf. Undergrads are kindless adolescence.
THORKEL: You see he is impossible.
OCK: Thorkel you are the dummiest administrator our university has ever had. Don't go Thorkel!! Come! Look! He starts to play his machines handles and buttons.
THORKEL: The university pays you to teach something to your students.
LIZ: Well, do you mean nothing. or do you mean something but you won't tell me what it is?
PETER: ( regaining ) I mean plain nothing.
LIZ: Well, I guess that's about as nothing as you can get. plain nothing. A beat.
PETER: Ahh, it is something.
LIZ: Ahh, it is something.
PETER: No. look. The equipment on her TABLE is starting to vibrate. They look at it, curiously. We hear the cyclotron's WHINE begin to build.
OCK: I am going for 20 percent power!
THORKEL: NO!! Don't do that.
ROZ: Ock! Its dangerous.
THORKEL: Ock I warn you. WEINER crosses himself. The CONSOLE erupts in sparks.
THORKEL: Keep calm, everybody keep calm. Use the front door. Everybody out the front.
PETER: Liz! Come on.!
LIZ: I can't. Help me!
PETER: I'm coming! He wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the FLAMES. His sleeve is on fire. He pats it out.
LIZ: Flash appears and tries to help but Thorkel stops him.
THORKEL: Get back, you idiots. You can't go in LIZ smashes at the WINDOW, but this is an inner city school and the WINDOWS are covered by STEEL GATES. Liz wraps her fingers in the GATE.
LIZ: ( out at the street ) Help! Help me! Outside the WINDOW the air is clear and people come and go. Some are stopping to look up at the girl on the second floor who screams ( but they can't hear, of course ) down at them as the FLAMES close in behind her. PETER comes flying in with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He fumbles with it. FLASH pushes Thorkel, grabs the extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain. LIZ turns to face the FLAMES. Suddenly there is an eruption of CO2 CLOUDS and the roar of a FIRE
PETER: Thanks for your help Flash.
FLASH: No problem wimp.
PETER: Our hero has a real way with words.
LIZ: Oh, why don't you grow up. PETER is stung, insulted, turns away. ROSOMORF peeps in, worried faces Thorkel.
THORKEL: This man will bring a disaster upon this OCK comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has The universe is made up of forces. and counter-forces. Science is the study of the forces! FLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER. LIZ embraces FLASH, throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely. He looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on the last of the FIRE.
OCK: The universe is made up of forces. and counter-forces. Science is the study of the forces! FLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER. LIZ embraces FLASH, throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely. He looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on the last of the FIRE.
OCK: ( continues without a hitch ) But I. Professor Otto Octavius. have devoted my life to the study of the counter-forces! Good job, Peter.
PETER: ( taking place at lab table ) Thanks, Professor. THORKEL has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the front of the huge LAB. He simply cannot believe OCK'S I don't believe it, I simply don't.
THORKEL: I don't believe it, I simply don't.
OCK: Can we carry on Mr. Thorkel.
THORKEL: I don't believe. oh, all right carry on Well! This week my dear students I have made a stunning breakthrough.
OCK: Well! This week my dear students I have made a stunning breakthrough.
THORKEL: Wait a minute, wait a minute. you've got fire forms to fill out, Dr. Octavius.
OCK: I have no time for forms, or administrators who persist in interrupting me, Mr. Thorkel. THORKEL steams out and bangs shut the DOOR.
OCK: I now believe its possible that these counter forces can be. collected. the way the magnifying glass collects the sunlight. and focused into a hard beam I call. Weiner! WEINER backs away from the BLACKBOARD to reveal a word that OCK has scrawled in large letters. It says "Anti- I call it, the Anti-Force! OCK is plugging a HUGE CABLE into a small LUCITE BOX with a SILVER BALL inside it.
OCK: I call it, the Anti-Force! OCK is plugging a HUGE CABLE into a small LUCITE BOX with a SILVER BALL inside it.
OCK: ( continues as he works ) This anti-force, once harnessed, is capable of undoing any natural force at which it is aimed. for instance. ( looks up maniacally ) LIZ scribbles down a note and mouths the word "gravity." Then she turns to PETER.
LIZ: ( whispers ) I'm sorry.
PETER: It's alright. OCK is "playing" his COMPUTER like the Phantom of the Opera at the organ.
OCK: We patch in the cyclotron. The lights flicker and go dim.
OCK: Pay no attention to the lights. I of course steal its energy, and it looses power. We patch in the cyclotron. and we gradually apply power. The power that I am stealing. As the WHINE builds in the LAB. OCK peers through the LUCITE BOX at us, distorted by it. The BOX is a miniature version of the cyclotron's experimental chamber, and now the BLUE-WHITE glow begins. It crackles round the SILVER BALL.
OCK: And so we stand, four square against the fundamental force that orders and maintains our universe. gravity. which is holding down this goddamn ball. The LIGHTS go totally dark. The kids react with WHOOPS and CATCALLS.
HARRY: What a crock.
PETER: Shut up Harry. this is very interesting.
OCK: Mr. Parker! Have you some. interesting observation you'd like to share with the No sir.
PETER: No sir.
OCK: Then shut up! And pay some attention to the experiment. OCK peers at us through the LUCITE BOX as the SILVER BALL begins to rise. OCK'S face is ecstatic.
OCK: Rise! Rise!!! The SILVER BALL suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of the box. It flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a
OCK: Now that's what I call an experiment! The CYCLOTRON WHINE cuts out and OCK wheels to the COMPUTER. He hits a KEY and several COLORED PROJECTION BEAMS lance out of the back of the room. They pierce the smoke and light a PROJECTION DISPLAY in the front. TWO COLORED SPHERES one, YELLOW, one BLUE touch where their circumferences meet. Behind them is a BLACK depiction of "space".
OCK: You are looking at a representation of two universes. Our Blue one. Our real universe. something we can touch and feel and see and draw calculations about. This is us. The Yellow universe. this is something else. Some other dimension. something. on the other side! OCK hits another COMPUTER KEY and a hole appears where the TWO SPHERES touch. The BLUE AND THE YELLOW MARBLEIZE with each other. The colors swirl until both SPHERES are
OCK: If it were possible to generate enough power behind it, the anti-force could wipe out not just gravity. but all our universal forces at the same time. In effect. it would blast a hole between this universe and the next. Each. would flow into each other. No blue universe. No yellow. End, finished, That sounds like a scenario for the end of the world.
LIZ: ( with a student's ear ) That sounds like a scenario for the end of the world.
OCK: My girl, it is! It is. It would mean wiping out everything that's known. and letting in everything that's unknown.
FLASH: Isn't that a little dangerous?
OCK: Don't worry yourself, true inter- dimensional penetration is still purely theoretical, but one day. Maybe very near. maybe in the 21st century.
LIZ: ( whispers to Peter ) Look, it's just. I don't know. when you and Flash go after each other like ( whispers ) He's not my type.
PETER: ( whispers ) He's not my type.
LIZ: He doesn't have to be.
PETER: And besides, he's not all bad. PETER looks at FLASH who's a few LOCKERS down. FLASH has taken a FOOTBALL from his LOCKER and is spinning it on his finger with great joy and concentration.
LIZ: And besides, he's not all bad. PETER looks at FLASH who's a few LOCKERS down. FLASH has taken a FOOTBALL from his LOCKER and is spinning it on his finger with great joy and concentration.
PETER: You don't get nicknamed Flash because you're a rocket scientist, Liz.
LIZ: Give it up, Parker. You'd die for a nickname like Flash.
PETER: Yeah, of embarrassment. KIM comes by and leans seductively by her LOCKER. KIM is a ripe one and hot-hot-hot!
KIM: ( teasing ) Hey, Flash. I'm scalping a pair of the Midnight Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow The Slammies??? I'd kill for that!!!
FLASH: The Slammies??? I'd kill for that!!!
KIM: Would you pay $125?
FLASH: Well, uh, I. gee. if. can I tell you tomorrow?
KIM: ( moving on ) You snooze, you lose. Hiya Liz.
LIZ: Kim, you know Peter and Harry? This is my new roommate. Kim Nickson. KIM is pulling her pet, a foot long SALAMANDER, out of her LOCKER. She wraps it around her neck and turns to the They go bug-eyed!
KIM: ( interested ) Hellooo, Peter.
PETER: ( embarrassed ) We're going to the Student Reunion Meeting. You coming? Peter looks at KIM. Wow. Then he looks at LIZ who's adjusting herself in a small MIRROR. HARRY jabs him in the ribs. Yeah, yeah!
LIZ: We're going to the Student Reunion Meeting. You coming? Peter looks at KIM. Wow. Then he looks at LIZ who's adjusting herself in a small MIRROR. HARRY jabs him in the ribs. Yeah, yeah!
PETER: ( frustrated ) I can't. I gotta go over to the Daily Bugle. I'm trying to sell some photos.
KIM: Soooh, a photographer.?
PETER: Just an amateur. Well. nice meeting you, Kim.
KIM: Yeah. I bet it would be.
HARRY: Can I be your date for the reunion No Jerk!
KIM: No Jerk!
HARRY: ( she turns to go ) What did I say.
LIZ: It's not what you said, it's how you say it, ShooShoo! Everybody leaves and Harry is left alone, he throws his bag down.
HARRY: PETER turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking
WEINER: Peter, Doc Ock wants to see you.
PETER: About my data I bet.
WEINER: I don't know.
PETER: He knows about my work on the Planetary Conjunction, doesn't he?
WEINER: ( lies ) I don't know.
PETER: Hello, Professor Octavius. I really admired your experiment.
OCK: ( back to Peter ) We have a lot of interests in common, Peter. Perhaps we should put our heads together, if you know what I mean.
PETER: ( flattered ) That would be. great.
OCK: ( turns with a smile ) Now you take the Planetary Conjunction. This Saturday night we will witness Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the Sun. all in a row. Never seen within the memory of man, or measured for its effect. The total gravitational force must be quite exceptional. Isn't that the subject of your paper.?
PETER: Yes sir, I've worked out a new way to calculate the combined gravitational I'm a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think I could find the time to go over it with you. Make sure it all. checks out.
OCK: I'm a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think I could find the time to go over it with you. Make sure it all. checks out.
PETER: Well. I'm sort of working with Professor Rosomorf and he suggested we kind of keep it between us. He thinks that my theory is. well, I don't know.
OCK: ( to himself ) The scoundrel. ( turns angry ) I want to see that data, Peter!
PETER: But Professor Octavius. if I knew you were interested. sorry, I've already given it to. Professor Rosomorf, and he is after all the head of our Physics Department. and I couldn't. OCK turns sweet again. He smiles too broadly.
OCK: Well, I'm certain something can be worked out. Run along, young man. PETER begins to leave.
OCK: Just a minute. how about if I show you my discoveries. something I never showed to any other student. as a matter of fact to anybody at all.
PETER: Well I am really flattered, I mean I'd love to. but I.
OCK: Very well shall we say if you come here But Professor I don't now if I should.
PETER: But Professor I don't now if I should.
OCK: Make it eight sharp. I'll be waiting for you. Right here. Peter looks worried then leaves. OCK turns to WEINER who slouches against the wall smiling.
OCK: The same academic world that's so keen to embrace that boy's undergraduate work, ridicules my anti-force theory as quackery. I ask you, Weiner. what is our society coming to? Ha!
WEINER: They are all a bunch of brainless assholes, that's what I say.
OCK: Weiner! Go get me that boy's data!
WEINER: Cost you fifty bucks.
OCK: ( Weiner hissing ) Just get it. We'll negotiate your fee when you have the data, alright Weiner?
JAMESON: Bag ladies. I hate bag ladies.
PETER: Yes, sir. JAMESON is 50ish, grey at the temples, brush cut on top. He too is forties. His chewed up CIGAR is forties. This guy is a hard case.
JAMESON: ( looks at the other photos ) Little kids. I hate little kids. This is a daily newspaper. We need news value photographs, not artsy-fartsy shit!
PETER: Yes, sir. JAMESON comes to a picture of a BUSINESS SUITED MAN with a MOHAWK. PETER smiles in anticipation.
JAMESON: Kid? You want a pro's assessment?
PETER: Yes, sir!
JAMESON: ( handing photos back ) Your photos suck. ( cigar for emphasis ) Parker, my readers are morons. I gotta grab them by the eyes. Every time you press the button of that Nikon of yours it costs you fifty-five cents. So the next time you're about to take the plunge, ask yourself, am I taking dog bites man? Because if you are.
PETER: I know, I know. You want man bites dog.
JAMESON: Parker, this is the post modern 20th century. I want man eats dog! Get out!
PETER: ( reading ) Rent! Rent, more bills, rent. electricity, bills.
PETER: There's nothing in there worth stealing!
PETER: Aunt May, you're trespassing.
MAY: ( comes in ) I was just so desperately bored. I thought I'd come over and make you dinner.
PETER: I am old enough to. to make my own
MAY: But I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
PETER: I'll introduce you.
MAY: Oh. And those foul chemicals in the pots.
PETER: I take pictures, remember?
MAY: Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills. She grabs her coat, crosses back to Peter and tugs on his It's Friday night.
PETER: It's Friday night.
MAY: Yes. Do you have a date?
PETER: Then come on.
MAY: Then come on.
THORKEL: ( at his ear ) Professor Rosomorf, what happened here?
ROZ: Someone tried to rob me of some paper. I suspect they were looking for that one.
THORKEL: What is it?
ROZ: ( unruffled ) Award winning stuff. ( turning slightly ) Peter Parker's data on the Planetary Conjunction. Damn lucky I hid it in my computer under another title.
THORKEL: My God, what's going on in our school? First Professor Octavius almost blows up the Physics lab. Now this. You report it in triplicate, of course.
ROZ: Thorkel, be careful when you talk to Octavius. Remember. the man is a very fragile genius. One day he'll bring us all the Noble Prize.
THORKEL: Rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous Off screen the voice of the CYCLOTRON WHINE begins to That's him again. He's working day and I tell you the man is very dangerous. Come on Rosomorf, let's stop him before this building will explode.
ROZ: That's him again. He's working day and I tell you the man is very dangerous. Come on Rosomorf, let's stop him before this building will explode.
THORKEL: I tell you the man is very dangerous. Come on Rosomorf, let's stop him before this building will explode.
THORKEL: Shut it down, Octavius. OCK ignores him. WEINER touches OCK'S shoulder. OCK ignores him too.
THORKEL: You've blown half the circuits in the Science Center.
OCK: Call an electrician.
THORKEL: I have called the locksmith.
OCK: What. what is he doing. He points toward the worker who's working on the lock on the main door.
THORKEL: We have to shut your lab down and take a look at the lines.
ROZ: Please, Otto, we must lock it up.
OCK: ( to Thorkel ) You're denying me access to my cyclotron?!
THORKEL: You bet. OCK glares back and forth between the TWO MEN, the WORKER, and WEINER. Then he pulls BACK the RED POWER THROTTLE. The WHINE descends. The WALDOS pull back and dangle from their panel. The WHINE dies.
OCK: ( contemplating ) Okey, dokey. just give me till tomorrow. I want to clean up my papers. Tomorrow. Ha. Tomorrow you can have this room.
ROZ: Oh. well Thorkel. few more hours won't make a difference.
THORKEL: I hope. He signals to the worker to stop.
BEN: Another brewski?
PETER: No, I'm fine, Uncle Ben.
BEN: ( at T.V. ) Yah! Way to do it. Alright! ( to Peter ) You don't follow the Mets like you used to, do you, Pete?
PETER: No, not so much anymore.
BEN: Funny. When your Mom and Dad, uh, passed away. I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player that ever was. Geez, what ever happened to that?
PETER: Little league.
BEN: ( soft and warm ) Yeah. Babe Ruth you wasn't. AUNT MAY enters.
AUNT MAY: It's on the table! Turn off the TV! BEN nods, rises sluggishly and slowly, and turns the sound off only. PETER moves toward his AUNT in the doorway.
AUNT MAY: How's that girl you told us about, Peter?
PETER: Liz? She's great. But she has a INT. THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT PETER passes AUNT MAY and takes his seat.
AUNT MAY: A boy your age should have a girlfriend.
PETER: Aunt May. she has a steady boyfriend.
AUNT MAY: Peter, any girl that's worth your attention is of course gonna have a boyfriend. But if she really gets to know what you have to offer she'll. you get my drift?
BEN: Look, just leave him alone, okay. When he's ready for girls he'll be a holy It's in the blood. Lookit, how are you fixed for money, Pete? Maybe I can help you out a little.
PETER: ( lying to them ) No, I'm alright. My scholarship covers almost everything, and I sell some photos here and there. Today my physics professor asked for some of my work. he wants to study my data. They might publish my work in the science magazine. that'll bring me some money.
BEN: ( practically cheering ) Publish your work?! You hear that May.?
PETER: ( embarrassed laughs ) Yeah, in fact I have to leave a little early tonight, to meet Professor Octavius. He offered me to be his Whoa! Did you hear that May.?
BEN: Whoa! Did you hear that May.?
AUNT MAY: Oh, Peter, you promised you'd spend the I. I can't, Aunt May. Professor Octavius wants to discuss my new Peter, what you should be finding. is a nice girlfriend.
PETER: I. I can't, Aunt May. Professor Octavius wants to discuss my new Peter, what you should be finding. is a nice girlfriend.
AUNT MAY: ( disappointed ) Peter, what you should be finding. is a nice girlfriend.
OCK: I'll show them. closing the cyclotron on me. Weiner!
WEINER: Yes, Professor.
OCK: Where is he? It's ten past eight o'clock.
A KNOCK: ( with mouth full ) That must be him. He opens the door.
WEINER: ( with mouth full ) That must be him. He opens the door.
PETER: Good evening.
OCK: You are late. Weiner, go outside and get us something to eat. And don't steal it! Just buy it. I'll reimburse you.
WEINER: ( to Peter ) Do you want anything Parker?
PETER: No thank you, I just had dinner at my Piss off, Weiner! WEINER leaves. PETER wanders around. He goes into the experimental chamber, he overlooks the SPIDER which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open WINDOW. and into the chamber.
OCK: Piss off, Weiner! WEINER leaves. PETER wanders around. He goes into the experimental chamber, he overlooks the SPIDER which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open WINDOW. and into the chamber.
OCK: Okey, dokey, Parker. how would you like to take Weiner's place. I mean, be my Well, Professor, that would be a great honor, but I'm already working with.
PETER: Well, Professor, that would be a great honor, but I'm already working with.
OCK: Rosomorf. that imbecile. Don't you understand, kid, that I am about to uncover the greatest discovery since Einstein came up with his theory of relativity. The "Anti-Force."
PETER: Wow! The theory of the Anti-force! You should go for the Noble Prize Professor.
OCK: Noble Shmoble, I am going for a much bigger prize kid. Okey, dokey. Let me show you, kid, what I got here. OCK begins the experiment. We move in past the shattered WINDOW. We see the SPIDER crawling on the chamber's GEAR.
OCK: Present maximum anti-force power to date is 38 percent of theoretical limit. I have patched in the variable particle-wave accelerator. I will now try to reach 50% power. And if your paper has any value. I can use it to get the power I'm missing to create the anti-force, to break through and beat any other form of power in our or any other universe, capish!
PETER: Sorry, Professor, I can't do it. I gave my word to Professor Rosomorf. OCK is angry. Ock now sees the SPIDER. He shoots out a WALDO to try and crush it but the SPIDER is too fast. The WALDO slams against the wall of the chamber. He starts to push every button or switch in sight. A deafening whining An URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the "Relative Gravity" DIAL. It is at "4.999999KG" but suddenly the numbers start to tumble rapidly. INSERT: The glowing 5KG WEIGHT. INSERT: The POWER DIAL inches toward 50% POWER!
OCK: ( screaming ) 50 percent. anti-force. 50 percent. that's all I'm missing! Parker, we can be rich together!
PETER: Sorry. I'd better go now.
OCK: ( really angry now ) You'll be sorry, Parker. PETER leaves. Another URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the monitor SCREEN. On it, flashing RED, is the word, "OVERLOAD!" OCK pushes the RED POWER THROTTLE forward! The WHINE increases to a PULSE and THROB.
SPIDER!: You! Get out of there, you creeping. He tries to shove the SPIDER with his hand.
OCK: You! Get out of there, you creeping. He tries to shove the SPIDER with his hand.
OCK: ( anguish ) The gravity DIAL goes to .000001, then pops back up as OCK'S tiny world goes berserk. DIALS spin, crack, explode or droop liquidly. WIRES dance on the CONSOLE which erupts like the 4th of JULY. OCK begins to float. His shirt begins to tear away. A DIAL floats by with its pulled WIRES undulating like a Medusa. WALDOS smash through the walls and flail like snakes. OCK'S YELLOW THERMOS distorts and EXPLODES! OCK, his hair wild, face locked in a multi-G grimace, is pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with
OCK: ( ecstasy above the din ) It's an energy storm! Okey! Dokey! We see clearly the SPIDER still stuck to his neck. The big beast buffets and shakes. Tubes, junctions, valves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where they twitch and writhe with a life of their own. Then, an enormous EXPLOSION rips a large hole in the CYCLOTRON's side, sending debris and a HUNDRED MICRO- STREAMS of ELECTRONIC PARTICLES lancing in our direction.
WEINER: Professor. what happened to you? What did you do. Suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he flies back and out through the door to the corridor.
WEINER: Oh my God. what happened here. He hears the police sirens approaching, he runs away.
WEINER: I better get out of here.
THORKEL: ( through bull horn ) There is no danger. Please go back to your dorms. I repeat, there is no danger.
JAMESON: ( approaches him ) Spill it out, Professor! The public wants to know! The CROWD closes on THORKEL.
THORKEL: Who are you?
JAMESON: Jameson, Daily Bugle, Chief Editor, now what really happened here?
THORKEL: There will be a press announcement in the morning Mr. Jameson. now if you'll excuse me. This elicits a flood of AD LIBS: "I heard a terrible explosion?" "Nuclear accidents?" "Meltdown?" "Genetic engineering?" "Are you guys making mutants in there?"
THORKEL: I have nothing to say. there will be an announcement. Now, please go home. everybody. we must clear the grounds. In the back of the crowd are PETER, HARRY, LIZ, FLASH and
FLASH: You think they'll cancel classes?
HARRY: They must. the whole building must be contaminated with some kind of poisonous How about nuclear contaminations?
PETER: How about nuclear contaminations?
KIM: My God. lets beat it. But nobody moves.
LIZ: ( more interested in other things ) Could anyone be in there, Peter?
PETER: ( concerned ) I don't know. Maybe Professor Octavius. He usually works late.
FLASH: That nut, I bet it was all his doing.
JAMESON: ( seeing Peter ) Hey Parker! Peter Parker! PETER pushes forward.
PETER: Mr. Jameson! What are you doing here? What's going on?
JAMESON: That's for them to know, and for you to find out.
PETER: But sir, they wouldn't tell us. You heard Thorkel. he said.
JAMESON: A press announcement tomorrow.! But we must know tonight Parker. This is your university, right.
PETER: Yes, but.
JAMESON: You got your camera?
PETER: Sure, but I can't
JAMESON: A hundred dollars says you can?
PETER: Yes sir!
JAMESON: Get inside and get pictures, fifty bucks.
PETER: You just said a hundred.
JAMESON: Seventy, but I want blood and gore.
PETER: ( calling back ) Seeya guys. He dashes off. FLASH shakes his head in dismay at this Where is he going?
LIZ: Where is he going?
JAMESON: To make fifty bucks.
THORKEL: What was that?
ROZ: What was what?
THORKEL: What hit me?
ROZ: What hit you?
THORKEL: I don't know. It was so fast.
ROZ: You're going to be fine, Otto. PETER gets off a shot and ducks into the MEN'S room leaving the DOOR ajar for a peak. A WALDO slips down from the SHEET. PETER'S eyes go wide at the sight. What in the hell has happened here?
PETER: PETER throws the SPIDER to the ripply tile floor where it scuttles unsteadily out the door. Sweat starts to bead on PETER'S face. He shakes his head to clear it. His vision becomes uncertain. He lurches against a WEIRD SINK. PETER'S POV is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not just moving in and out anamorphically. It's all of that!
PETER: I feel a little funny.
GUARD: ( heavily distorted ) Yeah? Well, I ain't laughing. Get out. Just get out of here.
GUARD: ( still distorted ) You get yourself over to the Police lines.
PETER: ( ultra wooz ) Right. Police lines.

There'll be two crisp twenties tucked He hurries off. PETER peers after him and all of a sudden his vision corrects to a perfect focus. The sweat is gone. He's okay. He makes his way through the crowd to the street. We TRACK with PETER as the madding throng recedes behind him. He turns a corner. He hears a SIREN. An AMBULANCE screeches around the corner. It nearly hits PETER who leaps to avoid it.

PETER: ( mutters to himself ) This is weird. My God, I feel so weird. He leaps to his feet. He flexes. Feels weird. Good Weird. In fact, great weird! He tries a couple of "jumping jacks" and on the third jump he soars into the ( exhilarated ) Very weird. The great, bespangled, NEW YORK CITY is his backdrop as PETER jumps and turns and does loops in the air. With the agility and tactility of a spider, PETER leaps from the RAILING to a WALL to a FLAG POLE to another WALL where he lands sideways and sticks.

PETER: ( sideways ) Very, very weird. He leaps off the WALL and lands at the edge of the roof. He looks down. No one's looking back. So, he takes a step back and leaps the alley to the next roof.

THORKEL: What used to be the cyclotron was permanently shut down this afternoon.
OCK: But my work!
THORKEL: Your work is a disaster! Look at Myself? I don't matter. Nobody matters anymore. To enter a new dimension we must first destroy our own.
OCK: Myself? I don't matter. Nobody matters anymore. To enter a new dimension we must first destroy our own.
THORKEL: What are you saying? OCK gets off his bed throwing away his sheet waving with his 4 WALDOS and 2 arms.
OCK: Destroy life. Life is. insignificant. Bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. What would you say?
THORKEL: Oh, my God, what are those horrible things sticking from your body?
OCK: ( gets more and more excited ) Thorkel, if I told you that for one moment in time I broke all the laws! For one brief glorious moment, I broke through to the other side. I saw. I felt. I became creation.
THORKEL: What on Earth are you rambling about?
OCK: Destiny!!! My destiny! I see it all so clearly now. Universal destruction, yes. All I need is the power. then I can destroy this illusion you call life. It is my destiny to lead us to the light!
THORKEL: You're a madman.
OCK: And you are a fool. I will end the universe as you know it. And in that final moment. I'll laugh my ass off while you're kissing yours goodbye!
THORKEL: ( excited ) Goodbye is right, Octavius. You're fired. sacked. canned. You are history, Doctor Octavius. And I couldn't be more pleased to be the first to tell you this good news. A WALDO shoots up and grabs THORKEL by the throat. He GASPS and SCREAMS silently as the telescoping WALDO lifts him off his feet. He rises until his head is just inches from the ceiling.
THORKEL: ( his last words ) Let me down Ock. you crazy. MONSTER! Let me down! Then OCK smiles and slams THORKEL'S head through the ceiling. PLASTER rains down. THORKEL'S legs scissor and kick and then go limp. OCK throws his dead body on to the bed, and covers him with the WHITE SHEETS.
OCK: Okey, dokey.

LIZ: ( walking ahead ) Yeah. he's some clown we saw on TV last night. boy does Flash think he's hot.
PETER: He does.
KIM: I love wrestling.
HARRY: Wrestling is all bluff. Do you really believe this little guy in a stupid Spider-Man suit beat the Crusher?
LIZ: Hey, we better rush. visiting hours will be over soon.
NURSE: Doctor Octavius? You have visitors. Doctor Octavius? We hold for a beat. When LIZ takes a step forward to look around we expect the worst. But nothing grabs her. PETER sees a pile of PLASTER on the floor. He looks up and sees the hole in the ceiling. LIZ and HARRY look up too. OCK is not there.
PETER: Ock is not here!
LIZ: My God, what happened?
NURSE: I'd better call the doctor!
HARRY: You'd better call the police! KIM screams.
OCK: What a wreck. What a useless, wasted wreck. Okey, dokey. We rebuild you, my damaged darling. Bigger, better, hotter! A world class, super cyclotron! He hears a NOISE behind him and reacts. And here comes WEINER. Bedraggled, shuffling through the CONTROL ROOM door. He eyeballs the incredible wreckage.
WEINER: There you are, doc. where have you been. whoa this place is messed up. OCK turns, WALDOS writhing. WEINER sees them and kind of ducks, remembering how he was hit by them once.
WEINER: ( smirks ) Whoa, doc! You look a little messed up Where have you been, you imbecile?
OCK: Where have you been, you imbecile?
WEINER: I went to the wrestling.
OCK: I went after the kid. You still want that Parker guy's data, don't you?

OCK: Spider-Man, huh? Well, maybe I'll just go and wrestle myself one of these days. with all my new arms. I'm sure I can beat Crusher or any other monster. Suddenly OCK throws out his WALDOS from under his long white coat, grabs WEINER and, lifts him up in the air, smiles cynically and with cruelty!
OCK: Will I beat him, this Crusher, will I beat him or not?
WEINER: No. no, please. I mean yes, yes. you'll beat him easily. let me down. Please. I'll do anything for you.

WEINER: All right. boss please let go.
OCK: Just get it, Weiner. I'm running out of time. If you fail me again, you won't have to concern yourself with money anymore. DO YOU GET ME CLOWN?! WEINER croaks his assent.
HARRY: You should have worn a costume. I told you to wear a costume.
PETER: It's. embarrassing.
HARRY: There's Liz. LIZ is crossing the dance floor dressed as an INDIAN PRINCESS in an MINI-DRESS.
PETER: ROZ, dressed as a COWBOY, ambles over.
ROZ: . howdy partners.
HARRY: Any word on Doctor Octavius?
ROZ: ( falling in step ) Nothing beyond what I read in the papers. I'm afraid he's not the same man we knew. You know, I've been digging through the notes on his experiments. PETER follows LIZ with his eyes. She takes a seat at a TABLE next to KIM who wears a HAREM GIRL outfit with the SALAMANDER around her neck. Next to KIM is. SPIDER-MAN! PETER'S eyes go wide.
ROZ: You boys must have had an extraordinary classroom experience.

ROZ: Whenever you're ready. I'll look at it. I know it's going to be an important work. and Peter, take my hat. He hands PETER an oversized TEN GALLON HAT.
ROZ: It is a costume party. PETER and HARRY make their way through the dance floor to the table. PETER can't take his eyes off SPIDEY.
HARRY: Look, there's Spider-Man!
PETER: Not the real one, I'm sure.
HARRY: You can never be sure. all kinds of crazy stuff can happen at a masquerade I bet I know who it is. As they take seats, PETER sees that SPIDER-MAN is trying to read the BUGLE'S sports section by party light. KIM waves. PETER nods and the BIG HAT falls over his face.
PETER: I bet I know who it is. As they take seats, PETER sees that SPIDER-MAN is trying to read the BUGLE'S sports section by party light. KIM waves. PETER nods and the BIG HAT falls over his face.

PETER: His pretty blue eyes give him away.
HARRY: Anyway, who'll be sitting with you at the Halloween Ball?

KIM: I'm pooped.
LIZ: I'm not. She reaches for HARRY'S hand.
FLASH: Holy jumping jelly beans, willya look at these pictures of Spider-Man? Wow! Is this guy great or what? LIZ looks. She shrugs. Then she shrieks.
LIZ: Hey, Peter! These are your pictures!

KIM: Hey, Flash-Man. Wanna dance.?
FLASH: Well, why not. PETER is left alone, PETER leaves toward the entrance. At the REAR DOOR a BIG LIZARD passes a NOTE to a DALLAS COWGIRL who passes it to a KANGAROO. The KANGAROO hops across the dance floor to the STAGE where he hands the NOTE to a YOUNG WOMAN in a BASEBALL UNIFORM. She climbs the STAGE where she is bathed in a SPOTLIGHT. She gets a DRUM ROLL from the band. There are some BOOS as the bad stops.
YOUNG WOMAN: Thank you, thank you. We have a special surprise guest tonight. The Empire State University Masquerade Ball presents. The "Slammy" winning star of MTV'S wrestling tournament. The Amazing Spider-Man! FLASH, amazed turns to LIZ. He points to himself and mouths, "Me?" ( The REAL ) SPIDEY drops from the ceiling and lands in a pose. The CROWD cheers. He does a flip to LIZ and extends a hand. The BAND starts up. LIZ demurs.
FLASH: ( whispers firmly ) Go ahead. go ahead! LIZ takes SPIDEY'S hand and they move slowly and sexily onto the dance floor. They do a short simple number. SPIDEY returns LIZ to FLASH.
LIZ: ( to Flash ) Come on. Flash. FLASH takes LIZ from PETER ( SPIDER-MAN ). LIZ and FLASH dance wildly. They finish to big cheers. The real SPIDER-MAN slides to center floor. The crowd backs away as SPIDEY spins out the greatest dance number in film history. He's all over the floor and on the walls and on the ceiling and on the GLITTER BALL. He takes LIZ and flies with her. He breaks the place up. Then drops in a pose. BIG CHEERS. LIZ stops breathless, very near to SPIDER-MAN'S face.
LIZ: ( whispers breathless ) Who are you.?
PETER: One day you'll know.
LIZ: ( a long beat ) You sound very familiar.
BEN: ( to May ) What a bunch of crap. Goddamn rock and roll's screwed up the whole TV. He flicks off the set and turns to MAY who's asleep on the couch. He gently nudges her.

WEINER: INT. BEN AND MAY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT BEN descends the stairs from the bedroom. He peers off into the darkness and pulls his ROBE tight around him as if to ward off some unacknowledged danger.
CABBIE: Some crazy kinda town, huh? You hear about that hold-up? The guy with the six arms? Hey, I see it all on this job. What kinda outfit is that, anyway?

WEINER: ( at the window ) Stay back! ( gun burst ) Whoa. stay back down there! SPIDEY is inches from being torched. He sees a PIPE. He reaches out and grabs it. He swings out above the flames. But the PIPE begins to bend! The PIPE bends down. down. and then breaks! SPIDEY hangs precariously as WATER cascades out of the PIPE and puts out the FIRE. SPIDEY drops down and rest his head in his hands to collect himself. Then looks up. The GUN is at his head.
WEINER: Stand up, you. SPIDEY stands.
WEINER: You're my ticket outa here. Gimme that stupid mask! SPIDER-MAN hesitates. Then he begins to raise the MASK, but stops and shakes his head no.
WEINER: Then I'll take it myself. He reaches for the mask and SPIDER-MAN flips him across the room. WEINER lands in a CARGO net and becomes Well, look what we've caught in our web.
WEINER: Don't hurt me, man. Please don't hurt me.
COP #1: Hold your fire! WEINER is hanging from the ceiling in the the CARGO NET.
WEINER: Get me out of this madhouse! He falls down, immediately encircled by the POLICE OFFICERS. SPIDER-MAN flies above their heads, crashing through the WINDOW and disappears into the dark of night.
OCK: ( smiling ) Okey, dokey. OCK goes about checking out the CYCLOTRON. It looks good.
OCK: ( reading dials and numbers ) Amperage, okay. Flux, 14. Negative variable differential. good enough. He shuts it down. The WHINE whirs down.
OCK: Okey, dokey. now all I need is Parker's data. Where the hell is Weiner? Damn it. I can't trust anybody. Only you, my babies. only you can I trust. Okay. If I have to do everything myself. I'm going to do it. I'll be back. my babies. my new OCK hides the WALDOS under his coat and leaves the room.
PETER: ( panicked ) Oh my God. oh, it's you, Liz. I didn't expect you. uh. give me a He hides his SPIDER-MAN COSTUME.
PETER: ( opening the door ) Hi, Liz. Come on in.
LIZ: What were you doing in here?
PETER: ( looking around ) Cleaning up. Come on. I'll get your computer. Where's Flash parked? He picks up the COMPUTER and turns to her, but she's already looking around the apartment.
LIZ: Flash didn't come.
PETER: ( holding it ) Oh. Well. how are you going to get it LIZ walks into the room.
LIZ: Taxi. I guess. She discovers the PRINTS of SPIDEY that PETER has taped up around the apartment.
LIZ: You must spend a lot of time with this Spider-Man guy. Peter! Don't you think you ought to unplug that! PETER looks and sees that he is tethered to the wall. Embarrassed, he puts the COMPUTER back down.
PETER: ( embarrassed ) I, uh, I'll go down to the corner. see it I can hail that taxi. PETER leaves. LIZ smiles. She likes PETER. Why is he INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT A SHADOW of a MAN can be seen hiding. PETER does not notice him.
LIZ: ( crossing to it, wondering ) She is about to open the door when FOUR WALDOS smash through it, obliterating it. OCK stands in the shattered doorway, WALDOS writhing.
LIZ: Doctor Octavius.! You're. You're. You're so weird!. with those. what do you call those.
OCK: Waldos. Did you hear about Spider-Man? That's me. the real Spider-Man. now tell me, where is that jerky friend of yours. Parker?
LIZ: ( protecting ) Peter?. oh. he's not here. He's gone. I don't think he'll be back for awhile.
OCK: ( running his Waldo in her hair ) You wouldn't lie to your Professor now, would you?
LIZ: Of course not. Why would I lie about a thing like that? Really. He's. out.
OCK: We'll wait. OCK grabs LIZ'S HAIR with his WALDOS.
LIZ: What are you doing. let me go! Please. take those things out of my hair!
OCK: My Waldos, you mean.
LIZ: Whatever you call them. please. OCK shoots out TWO WALDOS. Simultaneously each grabs a CHAIR from different parts of the room and brings them to the TABLE.
OCK: She does. He does, too, and folds his WALDOS across his
OCK: ( chatty ) He's a nice boy. A little nerdy maybe, but nice, wouldn't you say?
LIZ: Oh, I don't know. Maybe. He's very ONE of OCK'S WALDOS rests on the TABLE curled around the COMPUTER. LIZ lets her hand rest on it. OCK warms You know, you're a fascinating young lady.
OCK: You know, you're a fascinating young lady.
LIZ: Thank you.
OCK: You're so refreshing. You're so.
LIZ: ( gone to far ) Oh, I wouldn't say shocking.
OCK: ( gone to far ) Oh, I wouldn't say shocking.
LIZ: I would! She sticks his WALDO in the ELECTRIC WALL SOCKET behind the COMPUTER! The CURRENT sizzles through him and he leaps up, WALDOS akimbo, like the "cartoon cat." LIZ runs out the door. OCK extricates himself from the current and gives chase.
LIZ: She looks both ways for PETER, doesn't see him, and takes off! OCK bursts from the doorway and runs off after LIZ.
PETER: Wait here.
PETER: LIZ ( V.O. ) ( screaming from the street ) Peter! Help! Peter! PETER springs into action. He grabs his SPIDEY SUIT out of a drawer and starts taking off his clothes.
OCK: Peter Parker has something I want. And I'm going to have something he wants. She dashes past him and runs into the outboard CARGO
OCK: ( holding Liz ) Who the hell are you?
LIZ: ( seeing Spidey ) That's a lot of crap, clown. I am Spider-Man, not you. ( points to Liz ) Ask you girlfriend. ( to Liz ) Tell him!
OCK: That's a lot of crap, clown. I am Spider-Man, not you. Ask you girlfriend. Tell him!
OCK: Let her go? What an excellent idea. If you do not deliver your friend, Mr. Spider-Man, yes. Yes, of course, I'll let her go.
LIZ: Put me down, you mechanical mutant! LIZ is having none of this. She kicks, she fights. She twists. She flails around, making things a little worse. The ground is yawning death beneath her. RRIIPP! PART of her BLOUSE tears away and LIZ plummets! SPIDER-MAN swoops down on a WEB-STRAND in his characteristic compound curve. He reaches out for the falling LIZ and misses her cleanly. The WEB is too short.
LIZ: ( falling away ) You jerk! He THWIPS her with a second WEB and together they swing to a HIGH GIRDER where he deposits her safe and sound.
LIZ: ( straightening herself ) Tell your friend Peter next time I'll get the taxi myself.
OCK: ( screams ) Hey. you jerk. you phony Spider-Man. Prepare to meet your death, bug. SPIDEY THWIPS a beam and swings across toward OCK.
OCK: I am thinking, insect. I'm thinking about exterminating you!
LIZ: SPIDEY gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by another barrage of blows from above.
OCK: Now I must kill you, you cretinous clown. OCK throws a roundhouse WALDO that nearly knocks SPIDEY off the GIRDER. He's just barely hanging on. But SPIDER-MAN'S not done yet. He THWIPS a HIGH BEAM and swings into a better attack position. The two SUPER- ADVERSARIES engage in battle. With OCK swinging from his WALDOS like a metal monkey and SPIDEY swinging from his WEBS like, well, like SPIDEY, they clang and bang through the GIRDERS of the
OCK: Once I dispose of you, Spider-Man, no one will be able to stop me.
OCK: My destiny! OCK throws his biggest punch yet. SIRENS can now be heard in the street. SPIDEY avoids WALDO strike after WALDO strike. OCK eludes WEB after WEB. But SPIDEY'S agility soon has him turning Over here, Octopus!
OCK: That's Professor Octopus to you Spider Give it up, Professor. You'll never catch me! OCK takes three steps and soars through the air.
COP #1: There he is!
COP #2: It's that Spider-Man!
LIZ: What do you think you're doing?
LIZ: Thanks but nooooooooooo!
COP #2: He won't get away this time!
COP #1: Hold your fire! He's got a girl.
COP #2: Looks like he's got a hostage.
LIZ: Wait a minute. Where are you taking me? SPIDEY hounded by the Police, rejected by the girl.
LIZ: ( Times Square ) Where are we?
LIZ: ( the Empire State Building ) If you're trying to impress me Spidey, I want you to know I'm not easy. Okay, I'm impressed. now put me down, Spidey. put me down.
LIZ: ( Tavern on the Green ) Wow. look, this is our dormitory. I can get to my room. Hey, wait a minute. there's Flash, if I'm not mistaken.
LIZ: You know my name?
LIZ: Okay, put me down and we can talk, Do you know who I am?
LIZ: All I know is you're the Amazing Spider-Man. or better you're Spidey the good guy on the block. you're a weirdo in a clown spider suit.
LIZ: Which one?
LIZ: Well, Flash is not exactly my boyfriend.
LIZ: There's someone I like, but he's too shy to notice.
FLASH: ( a beat )
LIZ: ( to Spider-Man ) You know everybody. Flash we have to call Peter! FLASH rushes right past LIZ to the WINDOW. There's a NEWSPAPER in his hand.
FLASH: Hey, they won't let up, man! They keep calling you an accomplice in that burglary murder. But that's a crock, ain't it? I'm with you, Spidey, 100%
FLASH: ( realizing ) By the way, what are you doing with. She needed a lift.
FLASH: Oh. okay! This calls for a beer! A lot of beer!
FLASH: Well. take care of that later. Wait here. I'll get the beer. He disappears. LIZ comes, tentatively, to the WINDOW where SPIDEY squats, desire and passion in his WHITE EYES.
LIZ: ( accusatory ) How'd you know this was Flash's place?
LIZ: Peter told you all about Flash?
FLASH: Hey, where'd he go? Hey, Spider-Man!! But SPIDER-MAN has disappeared.
LIZ: ( distracted ) Peter told your Hero all about me.
FLASH: He would, wouldn't he. that jerk!
PETER: ( whispers angrily ) EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY QUAD - DAY PETER is hurrying along. KIM in sunning herself ( hurrying by ) Kim! Have you seen Harry?
PETER: ( hurrying by ) Kim! Have you seen Harry?
KIM: Sure, lots of times. What a brainiac.
PETER: Yeah. have you seen him today?
KIM: No, un unh.
LIZ: ( catching up ) ( keeps walking ) Hi. have you seen Harry?
PETER: ( keeps walking ) Hi. have you seen Harry?
LIZ: No. What a night, huh?
PETER: ( laughs ) Yeah, that was some ride home. must have been pretty exciting.
LIZ: It was. okay. Look, I got two tickets to Les Miserables. wanna go?
PETER: Sorry. I'm really busy. I mean, not tonight. see you later.
LIZ: ( thinking ) Hey, Peter. how did you know about last What about last night?
PETER: What about last night?
LIZ: My exciting ride with Spider-Man.
PETER: Oh. Sorry. I gotta hurry. I have to find Harry. I'll see you later.
LIZ: PETER runs off. He sees a car approach and flags it.
PETER: Hey! Can I get a lift downtown?
FLASH: Take your shoes for a walk, Dork. FLASH gets out of his car, and crosses the lawn toward
OCK: We are new inserting Peter Parker's data on tonight's Planetary Conjunction. INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays Peter Parker's name and ID number and the title, "The Planetary Conjunction and it's effect on Earth Gravity."
OCK: Yes, yes! Go on! Go on! INSERT: NUMBER SEQUENCES appear on the SCREEN. Then a GRAPHIC of the EARTH moving into line with SATURN, JUPITER, the SUN and the MOON. In the corner a NUMBER Enormous. It's enormous. The Parker calculations add 4% gravitational force at the moment of full Planetary Conjunction. Adding this to present maximum power potential, I get. He looks up and sees the SCREEN a GRAPHIC "HOLE" opening up right through the EARTH! The widening HOLE is swallowing everything!
OCK: Enormous. It's enormous. The Parker calculations add 4% gravitational force at the moment of full Planetary Conjunction. Adding this to present maximum power potential, I get. He looks up and sees the SCREEN a GRAPHIC "HOLE" opening up right through the EARTH! The widening HOLE is swallowing everything!
OCK: I knew it. I knew it! Universal destruction! It's doable! I am putting a countdown clock on the Planetary Conjunction now! A LARGE DIGITAL DISPLAY reads, "13:00:03." The last seconds count down to, "12:59:59!"
OCK: ( playing the computer ) Okey, dokey. Now let's see if I have enough power to drive this beast. He starts hitting KEYS on his COMPUTER.
PETER: ( pulling Harry aside ) I gotta remember to have that fixed. ( opens the door ) There you are, I've been looking for you all over town.
HARRY: What happened?
PETER: Where were you?
HARRY: I went to the wrestling, wanted to see that Amazing Spider-Man, but he didn't show up.
PETER: Listen, Harry something terrible happened.
HARRY: What? What?
PETER: My Planetary Conjunction papers. they were stolen.
HARRY: Oh my God. Are you sure.? Who would do such a thing?
PETER: Of course. but why.?
HARRY: Of course. but why.?
PETER: We have to find out, sit down. I want to access Dr. Octavius' main program. I want to know about his experiments with the cyclotron. Can you do it?
HARRY: ( starts hacking ) I can try. I could access the system in the dorm. Okay. And through that I could crack the main line.
PETER: Alright. Now if we can just disrupt the Octavius file.
HARRY: Okay, let's try. HARRY cracks his knuckles like a safe cracker and bends to the task. The PHONE RINGS. PETER hits his jerry-rigged SPEAKER PHONE. HARRY keeps hacking.
PETER: JAMESON ( V.O. ) Parker? Peter Parker? This is J. Jonah ( looking over Harry's shoulder ) Mr. Jameson, you got me at a bad time.
PETER: ( looking over Harry's shoulder ) Mr. Jameson, you got me at a bad time.
JAMESON: What about that kid? On the job already?
OCK: Fusion cells.? All up. Internal temperature. okay. Risk? Let's fly. He starts flicking on SWITCHES and DIALS. The WHINE whirs up. He throws the RED POWER THROTTLE. The POWER DIAL goes to 90!
HARRY: Got something! INSERT: DIGITAL CLOCK display: "06:00:03"
PETER: What is it?
HARRY: Let me see. It's some kind of countdown Countdown to what?
PETER: Countdown to what?
HARRY: I don't know, but whatever it is, it's only six hours away.
PETER: The Planetary Conjunction?
HARRY: Could be.
PETER: Or Doc Ock's end of the world experiment. Or both!
HARRY: Wait a minute. You're not telling me you think the world is gonna end tonight.?
PETER: You want to wait around till midnight to find out?
HARRY: No, but.
PETER: Let's see what else we've got. Another set of numbers roll up on the SCREEN. They are accompanied by ELECTRICAL SYMBOLS.
HARRY: What's that?
PETER: It might be a calculation of the amount of power he needs to create the hole between the force and the anti-force.
HARRY: That's a lot of energy. What could generate power like that?
PETER: The closest you could come is the New York City Subway System. Again, the lights flicker and then dim and they return.
ROZ: EXT. MAJOR INTERSECTION - NIGHT TAXIS go by. TWO LOVERS stroll. We hear a familiar WHINE. The "WALK" and "DON'T WALK" signs FLASH at the same time.
BOY: Make up your mind! The signs EXPLODE! The COUPLE stops in their tracks. The BOY looks at the GIRL.
GIRL: What's going on? An ARC of ELECTRICITY now shoots between the LIGHT PILLARS of the SUBWAY STATION on the corner.
WOMAN: Oh my God!
MAN: Get back! Get back!
WOMAN: Several PASSENGERS climb out of the WINDOWS of the TRAIN or pry open the DOORS.
WOMAN: What are you doing here? Get out of here! Get out of here!
WOMAN: It's Spider-Man!
WOMAN: Hey, what are you talking about?!
MAN: Go Spidey! Go!
WOMAN: ( whining ) Is that the real Spider-Man? SPIDEY does a TRIPLE FLIP to his feet. He reaches up for the overhead RAILING and pulls it down easily. Oohs and aahs. SPIDER-MAN points it at the GLASS and hefts it.
HENRY: Come on. Come on. That's it. Step lively now.
WIFE: Henry, the rugs!
HENRY: Oh, shut up!
FIREMAN: ( into walkie ) Gimme more ladder! I need more ladder!
WALKIE: Negative on that, you're at full INT. LAST CAR - NIGHT Now only ROZ is left. SPIDEY approaches him. He clings to a POLE. INSERT: The COUPLING bends open! The CAR is hanging there from memory!
ROZ: This is Doctor Otto Octavius' work. I must get back to my university. I must stop Ock. he's gone crazy. Can you help me?
ROZ: Spider-Man! Listen to me! If he can do this with the train, if he's come this far, then I can pretty well predict his next step. He'll go to Plutonium SL 270 for the power. He must be stopped. or else he'll destroy our world. The COUPLING shrieks and the CAR lurches.
ROZ: Wait Spider-Man. I don't think I can make it. You mustn't waste time saving me. you must save the world! You must go and stop Ock!
ROZ: He is looking for Plutonium SL 270 I'm The CAR lurches on its side and ROZ flies out of the DOOR. SPIDEY THWIPS out a WEB that girdles ROZ'S waist.
ROZ: ( shouting ) There's only one place he can get the Plutonium SL 270.
ROZ: Toxic. toxic dump. any toxic dump would have SL 270. SPIDEY swings ROZ in an arc to the FIREMAN. He misses ROZ on the first pass. ROZ looks up at SPIDEY who stands in the doorway, manipulating the WEB. The FIREMAN grabs ROZ. Then, with an awful SCREECH of steel, the CAR pulls loose from the COUPLING. With SPIDER-MAN inside it, the CAR plunges ten stories to the street below.
COP: And you're looking at twenty years. SPIDER-MAN shoots a WAD of WEB GOO onto the COP'S GUN and leaps up onto the LUXURY CONDO. and swings up out of the frame. The COP aims and shoots. The BULLET makes a THWUMP noise. The WEB GOO stretches out about three feet and falls limp.
COP: What the hell!
AUNT MAY: You're as lovely as Peter said you were.
LIZ: ( embarrassed ) Thank you. He really wanted so badly to come see you. He called me up out of the ( great concern ) Tell me about Peter. What's he been up to? He seems so preoccupied.
AUNT MAY: ( great concern ) Tell me about Peter. What's he been up to? He seems so preoccupied.
LIZ: Oh, you know Peter. he's all caught up in some kind of study he's doing. Things are really crazy at the university now. Things are crazy. everywhere. I guess Peter's just. well, you know. pulled into his shell.
AUNT MAY: ( reminiscing ) When Peter was little, he loved to hide. In the closets. Under the sink. He always needed a secret place. But when I'd look for him, he'd always laugh. he wanted to be found.
LIZ: Yeah. well. I don't think he wants me to find him. Well, I'd better be going. My friend Flash is picking me up.
AUNT MAY: This Flash. he isn't your boyfriend, is No. not really. I think you can guess They smile knowingly at each other. LIZ goes toward the DOOR.
LIZ: No. not really. I think you can guess They smile knowingly at each other. LIZ goes toward the DOOR.
AUNT MAY: She turns.
AUNT MAY: Finders keepers, losers weepers.
LIZ: AUNT MAY That's what I used to say to Peter when I found him.
AUNT MAY: That's what I used to say to Peter when I found him.
OCK: A WALDO smashes through the WINDSHIELD but misses SPIDEY. OCK leaps from the CAR.
OCK: ( on the run ) You're a doomed bug, Wall Crawler. I've no time to waste on you now.
FEMALE COP: ( gun poised ) Alright! Freeze! Up against the wall and spread 'em OCK complies. He raises his hands. and spreads the WALDOS to full extension! The BIG COP screams and faints. The little FEMALE COP'S eyes POP. OCK swats the GUN from her hand. He starts to choke her. SPIDEY comes swinging to the rescue. He lands on the ROOF Hey, you big OCK, why don't you pick on someone your own size?!
OCK: Alright Spider-Bug. here I've come for OCK leaves the COP and attacks SPIDER-MAN, shooting his iron fist at him. OCK runs to the end of the alley. SPIDEY staggers to his feet and resumes the chase. OCK breaks into a red Corvette convertible, starting it with a WALDO. SPIDER-MAN comes out in time to see the Vette drive away. A CHINESE LAUNDRY TRUCK is passing. SPIDEY THWIPS it and is whipped away. He crawls over to the WINDOW.
FLASH: Spider-man! This is unbelievable.!
FLASH: You got it.
FLASH: I'm the best.
FLASH: Roger, wilco, over and out. He swerves. SPIDEY falls all over LIZ. They begin to careen through traffic, three peas in a very small pod.
FLASH: Why is he going to New Jersey, and who is it in that shitty red car.
LIZ: Don't you recognize him. it's Ock!
FLASH: What does he want with toxic waste?
FLASH: Sorry. can't do anything about this SPIDER-MAN jumps out of the car.
OCK: Okey, dokey.
OCK: Insect! I am going to squash you to death. Once I lay my Waldos on your skinny bones. OCK hurls a DRUM at SPIDEY. It erupts in a sizzle of LIQUID and GAS. Then the SIX-ARMED FIEND runs for the door with his SL 270.
OCK: Goodbye, Spider-Man!
OCK: So you've avoided the nuclear pool, have you, Spider-Man?
OCK: Oh, come on, Ock, be a good sport. Let's talk this over face to face. throw me a SPIDEY reaches out.
OCK: Okay. face to face. Catch this! OCK, way up at the opening above, raises a huge DRUM above his head. The DRUM leaks toxic waste in ORANGE TENDRILS. He is about to drop it down on SPIDER-MAN.
FLASH: Don't do it, Professor! We now see FLASH and LIZ in the BLUE MG.
OCK: ( puts down the drum ) I know you. and you, young lady. Both of you are in my physic class, aren't you.? Come. you can help me. I need to get some of these drums to my laboratory. help me. and I'll give you special grades. What'd you say? Suddenly he catches FLASH with a WALDO and starts to choke him. LIZ screams and tries to help FLASH.
LIZ: Leave him alone!!! Another WALDO grabs her. ROZ now appears on the scene.
ROZ: Leave them alone Otto!
OCK: But, they won't help me. Everybody is trying to destroy my experiment. And so are you, Rosomorf. Another WALDO grabs ROZ by his arm.
ROZ: Otto. I was wrong. I've gone over your research. It's brilliant, Otto. It's mad, but it's brilliant. You have much work left to do. I want to help you, Otto. For the sake of science, go and do your experiment. Leave. these kids alone and I'll help you.
OCK: You will? You too? Both FLASH and LIZ shake their heads okey dokey. OCK gestures to FLASH and LIZ.
OCK: Help me with these drums, I need to get them to my laboratory immediately.
ROZ: Do as he says. OCK pushes FLASH and LIZ with his iron arm. Gripping LIZ be her hair, he shoves her into the CAR.
OCK: Drive, Flash, before I flush your girl right down the toilet!
ROZ: Don't lose your energy screaming. Catch this rope and climb up, come on!
ROZ: I've been through the Octavius data. He has enough power with his Plutonium. Especially if he gets his hands on Parker's data, there he has enough power to do what he wants to do. And we are not going to stop him in time before the Planetary Conjunction occurs tonight.
PETER: Peter, where are you?
HARRY: Peter, where are you?
HARRY: Your Planetary Conjunction data? It's too late. Ock's got your paper, it's in his computer already. INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays a graphic of the SUN, EARTH, and MOON lining up with JUPITER and SATURN.
HARRY: But don't worry. he can never use it without Plutonium.
HARRY: Don't worry. he needs a huge amount of power. thousands of volts of electricity. to get to the Anti-Force.
HARRY: Damn. the Conjunction is due at midnight! What are we going to do?
OCK: Okey, dokey. have fun, young ones. for the last time. OCK leaves. LIZ and FLASH are tied together in the back seat of the CAR.
LIZ: ( still ministering ) What do we do now?
FLASH: We kiss the world goodbye. If he is right, all there is left to do is.
LIZ: Wait. I think I can release my right INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT How much time is left? Wait. I can find out. my God. 59 minutes!
HARRY: How much time is left? Wait. I can find out. my God. 59 minutes!
HARRY: I think I can get some help. I can teach anyone how to work a code in five Then do it!
KIM: Hey, this is easy. They all run from COMPUTER to COMPUTER.
FLASH: Hey, Harry I need help.
HARRY: HARRY types in KARNAKY LTD and gets the same response. He looks at his DIGITAL WRISTWATCH. "01:00:02" becomes "00:59:59" as we watch. Then a WARNING BUZZER!
KIM: I got one! I got one!
LIZ: Harry! Get over here! HARRY hurries to KIM'S side and elbows her out of the CHAIR. The SCREEN is flashing "WARNING, Security Breach!" HARRY'S hands fly over the keys. The KIDS gather around. LINE DRAWINGS of the CYCLOTRON ( progressing from large to small detail ) appear one after the other. Finally, a PIPE. There is a CIRCLE around a JOINT. And the legend
HARRY: A goddamn water leak.
FLASH: Hey, look at this. Empire State University. This is our cyclotron, What does it say?
HARRY: ( serious ) What does it say?
FLASH: ( hits two keys ) It says "no information on net."
HARRY: Damn. we can't do it.
KIM: You mean. we can't stop loony Ock.
HARRY: I mean the world is in danger.
FLASH: We must find Peter, he knows these computers better than all of us.
HARRY: Yes, but where the hell is he?
LIZ: ( mysteriously ) I bet he is with Spider-Man. Suddenly the lights dim. A heavy noise. An earth quake.
LIZ: Look at the moon. I have never seen it so big.
FLASH: What is that.
HARRY: Must be the sun. We now see the sky. With the sun on one side, and the moon on the other. They watch it, shocked, frightened out of their wits.
ROZ: Our campus. right there. see those beams from Ock's lab. We're late. it's coming. the Conjunction will happen in a few seconds. SPIDER-MAN massages his arm.
ROZ: Where.? What.? SPIDER-MAN SHOOTS out a WEB and flies toward the SCHOOL BUILDING taking ROZ with him.
OCK: ( looking back, madly ) Aha! You never included the Conjunction in your calculations, did you?! Rosomorf!
ROZ: Damn the calculations! My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to. all the patterns, all the harmonies. everything will be destroyed.
OCK: A new world waits! Rosomorf! It is my It is cosmic suicide! You have no right! ROZ flings himself through the MELTED WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. He grabs for the "BULLET" but the WALDOS grab him and throw him back. ROZ staggers backward. into the arms of SPIDER-MAN.
ROZ: It is cosmic suicide! You have no right! ROZ flings himself through the MELTED WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. He grabs for the "BULLET" but the WALDOS grab him and throw him back. ROZ staggers backward. into the arms of SPIDER-MAN.
ROZ: You have to stop him. Spider-Man you have to stop him.
LIZ: He's in there. I know Peter is in there. She breaks into a run.
FLASH: Liz, don't. Liz come back. come back! LIZ runs inside. They run after her. A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY flashes across the doorway, stopping them.
OCK: Okey, dokey!! My energy storm has started. My Anti-Force is on! History is being made. Spider-Man, Rosomorf cheer up friends. we're on our way to the unknown cosmos. we three are about to visit heaven. real Gods heaven.
ROZ: ( sees the sky through the window ) Spider-Man! The Conjunction! It's EXT. THE SKY - STRANGE COLORS - NIGHT The CONJUNCTION is now happening. INSERT: Surreal DIALS spin madly.
LIZ: Peter! Peter, where are you?!
FLASH: ( screaming ) Liz! Liz come on out! They run forward but as they reach the FRONT STEPS the building lurches upward. The bottom step becomes a wall of STONE and DIRT, six feet high.
HARRY: Get back! Flash. get back!
FLASH: Then the building lurches upward again! This time it pulls FREE from the ground. The KIDS take cover as WATER LINES BURST and ELECTRICAL WIRES SPARK.
LIZ: The building lurches throwing her back across the HALL where she crashes through another door.
FLASH: Oh my God. Liz is inside there!
HARRY: And Professor Rosomorf and crazy Ock.
FLASH: What about Peter? Is he there with them?
HARRY: No, but I bet Spider-Man is.
MAX: That's some show. if ever I saw one.
JAMESON: ( shouting ) Tear out the front page! Change the headline. The biggest news is happening right now. we need photos. a camera. get me a camera.!
ROZ: Where is it going Otto?
OCK: Other worlds, Roz, other times, other dimensions, who knows? Who cares?
ROZ: Then. why?
OCK: Truth, Rosomorf. Look at it! The new truth! The new way!
OCK: No, you don't listen to that clown, he can't save you, or the world for that A WALDO reaches in and rips ROZ off SPIDEY, flinging him back against a WALL. ROZ lands in a heap beneath a FIRE
OCK: Once and for all, Spider-Man. once and for all we'll end the legend of your OCK knocks SPIDER-MAN with a real BIG BLOW with his WALDO. OCK is slowly dragging SPIDER-MAN to a HUGE HOLE that's been ripped in the floor by the BEAMS of ELECTRICITY. We see New York a half a mile down through the hole. We see SPIDEY being drawn across the HOLE. Then ROZ comes flying in with the FIRE AXE. ROZ hacks away at the WALDO and chops it off! The stump withdraws. OCK examines it in pain and fury!
OCK: ( ultimate betrayal ) You!! You were my teacher!!! ROZ doesn't even look back. He and SPIDEY are at the edge of the HOLE and he's shaking SPIDEY furiously. OCK sends out his other WALDO and begins banging it on the floor in a frenzy on either side of ROZ and SPIDEY. Like a child denied, he smashes his steel fists against the floor again and again.
OCK: You were my teacher! And you want to destroy my experiment. You are a scientist for heaven sake. don't you want to know what's up there?
ROZ: Yes, but not on account of our world. We have only one world. only one life. The floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around a hole on a pond. BANG! BANG! SPIDEY comes to just as the section of floor beneath himself and ROZ gives way and falls through. SPIDEY grabs hold of the edge and dangles. He looks down and sees ROZ falling away beneath him, disappearing into the dark.
ROZ: ( calling back from the dark skies ) Spider-Man! Only you can save us now.
OCK: Forget that old fool, insect. My Spider-Man. Come join me on my fantastic voyage to the 7th heaven.
LIZ: Peter! Peter!
LIZ: Where's Peter? He must be here somewhere.
LIZ: This building is flying. I'm in a goddamn flying building.
LIZ: Oh my God. A third WALDO, a broken one, snakes up from the HOLE and begins feeling blindly around on the CONSOLE for the POWER
POWER THROTTLE!: Spider-Man. You're end is coming. Life in its present form is ending. new dimensions, new horizons. The UNIVERSAL BULLET begins to GLOW. The GLOW sharpens to a POINT of LIGHT. SPIDER-MAN holds on tight against a rushing ENERGY FLOW that's pulling everything in the room towards the POINT of LIGHT.
OCK: Spider-Man. You're end is coming. Life in its present form is ending. new dimensions, new horizons. The UNIVERSAL BULLET begins to GLOW. The GLOW sharpens to a POINT of LIGHT. SPIDER-MAN holds on tight against a rushing ENERGY FLOW that's pulling everything in the room towards the POINT of LIGHT.
LIZ: ( bracing against the storm ) What is happening?
LIZ: I can't. hold on! SPIDEY THWIPS her and she grabs onto the WEB.
OCK: ( spaced out ) You cut my power. there's too little power. It's so tiny. so tiny. there's only space. for me. But I've done it, Spider-Man. I have broken through. I've broken through!
LIZ: Don't do it, Dr. Octavius!
OCK: Okey. dokey. Now that's what I call an experiment!!! As he nears the LIGHT he actually becomes a part of it. He radiates LIGHT. He shimmers and shines. He fills the room with BLINDING LIGHT. SPIDEY and LIZ shield their eyes, and as the light diminishes, the storm subsides. They're safe. Except for the fact that they're in a floating building, 10,000 feet above the city!
LIZ: But what about Peter? We've got to find Peter will be okay, I promise you. Let's go before it's too late.
LIZ: Go where?
LIZ: It's breaking apart!
LIZ: We have to go back.
LIZ: Forget it.
LIZ: ( shouting across ) What am I supposed to do with this!
LIZ: The door is stuck. SPIDER-MAN bends his back to the task. It take all his strength, but with a comic AAAAARGGHH! He bends the DOOR EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT They burst out onto the ROCK FOUNDATION of the building. New York is rushing up to meet them. The WIND created by their fall buffets them. The HELICOPTERS arrive, and the falling building plunges right past them. The HELICOPTERS look across at each other, helpless.
PETER: Come on. I've found a way down.
LIZ: ( at long last, love ) I knew you were going to say that. They run out of the ROOM. We PAN down and see, crumpled beneath the WINDOW, the SPIDER-MAN suit.
LIZ: Where's the way out?
PETER: Right there! We are looking at the HUGE AMERICAN FLAG.
PETER: Come on, help me with this.
PETER: Okay, stand still. He ties some ROPE around her waist.
LIZ: Is this going to work?
PETER: How do I know?
LIZ: I just adore confidence in a man.
PETER: Come on. They move to the edge of the ROCK and look down. CENTRAL PARK is still a couple thousand feet down.
LIZ: What is it you say when you jump?
PETER: Your prayers. They SCREAM as the building lurches again, knocking them to the ground. They start to slide across the ROCK. They reach out for each other but their hands don't quite Slowly, they inch back together, but the FOUNDATION cracks between them.
LIZ: We have a lot to thank your friend Spider-Man for.
PETER: Somehow, I don't think we've seen the last of him.
LIZ: Peter.! Finders, keepers.
PETER: What.? What is it? Why do you look like that?
LIZ: I think I'm in love.
PETER: ( even his eyes blush ) You are.
LIZ: With your friend.
PETER: Spider-Man? You're in love with I am. you think we'll see him again?
LIZ: I am. you think we'll see him again?
PETER: We might. you never know. He kisses her.
LIZ: ( bittersweet ) This may be the end of a beautiful friendship you know?
PETER: They land in the center of the park under the parachute. They stay there and kiss. completely covered by the flag. Camera pulls up to show the building floating away.
