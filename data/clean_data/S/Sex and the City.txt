CHARLOTTE: You have your honeymoon stuff here.
CARRIE: There's the silver lining. A honeymoon to a romantic Mexican resort that's pre-paid on my credit card because I wanted to surprise the man who jilted me.

SAMANTHA: Well, as long as we're going down this road.
CHARLOTTE: You love him.
SAMANTHA: Does that mean saying his name fifty times more a day than I say my own? Does it mean worrying about him and his needs before me and mine? Is it all about the other person? Is that love?
MIRANDA: No, that's marriage.
CARRIE: So, you're saying marriage is a bad thing? Good to know right about
SAMANTHA: Even this ring. I wanted to buy this for myself. That meant something to me. To be able to do that. Then, he buys it for me.
CHARLOTTE: Because he knew how much you loved Yes. But now, every time I look down at it. I see him. Not me.

CHARLOTTE: You really can't forgive him?
MIRANDA: Are you suggesting something?
CHARLOTTE: I like Steve. I've always liked Steve He's apologized a hundred times he's not seeing anyone else. What's it going to take?
MIRANDA: And are you also suggesting that she forgive Big?

CARRIE: ( duh? ) Ah.. yes.
CHARLOTTE: I curse the day you were born.

CARRIE: I think it was like this last year but we played for the other team.
WAITRESS: Good evening. Here's our special Valentine night menu. All the selections are romantic in theme and designed to be split for two. Are you having wine?
WAITRESS: A glass or a bot
WAITRESS: I'll be right back to take you and your girlfriends order.
MIRANDA: I could do a lot worse.
MIRANDA: Why would you look at the Vogue today of all days?
CARRIE: `Cause I'm an emotional cutter. I deserve what I got. Running all over New York believing that I'm finally getting my happy ending. "See everyone, love does conquer all. Look at me in my one of a kind wedding gown marrying the love of my life."
WAITRESS: Would you like another bot
CARRIE: And Miranda. in that article I did not say "we" once. It was all: "I" want and "I" think.
MIRANDA: It was from your point of view.
CARRIE: My point of view. Exactly. The whole wedding was my point of view. I let the wedding get bigger than Big. I am the reason he didn't get out of that car.
MIRANDA: You can't put this all on yourself. Okay. I said something I shouldn't have said to Big at the rehearsal
CARRIE: What do you mean?
MIRANDA: I was really upset after Steve showed up and I bumped into Big and I said that you two were crazy to get married.
WAITRESS: Here we go. Your Shiraz.
MIRANDA: Stop It's fine Thanks.
CARRIE: I have been going over this and over this in my mind for five months and for five months you kept a secret like that?
MIRANDA: I tried to tell you once but the Vogue article came out
CARRIE: Once? You tried to tell me once? You should have tried to tell me every single day!
MIRANDA: I know, I was looking for the right There is no right time to tell me you ruined my marriage!
CARRIE: There is no right time to tell me you ruined my marriage!
MIRANDA: It just happened I wasn't
CARRIE: And I think what hurts the most is that you kept a secret from me. I have never ever kept a secret from you. Ever!
SMITH: I'm home!
SAMANTHA: You are three hours late.
SMITH: Bummer. I know. Did you eat?
SAMANTHA: Yes, I ate. I ate the sushi that I hand made for you. The sushi that I planned to lay all over my naked body as a Valentines surprise for Why are you so upset? I called.
SMITH: Why are you so upset? I called.
SAMANTHA: I slaved away in a kitchen all day to make this meal for you.
SMITH: You made some sushi it's not a big deal!
SAMANTHA: Not a big deal?
MIRANDA: Carrie looks. Stops.
CARRIE: How long have you been waiting
MIRANDA: Seventeen dollars long. Please get in. It just turned to
CARRIE: I'm upset.
MIRANDA: Carrie, I understand but it just happened I never meant to hurt You have to forgive me.
CARRIE: You know
MIRANDA: Please. What were you going to say?
CARRIE: Please. What were you going to say?
MIRANDA: Please. What were you going to say?
CARRIE: You badger me to forgive you in three days and you won't even consider forgiving Steve for something he did six months ago.
MIRANDA: It's not the same thing.
CARRIE: It's forgiveness.
MIRANDA: I don't know if I can trust that it won't happen again.
THERAPIST: Steve - you're very quiet today.
STEVE: Miranda, I know I made it hard for you to trust me. But You made it hard for me to trust you.
MIRANDA: The way you treated me and cut me out of your life like that? I mean, yeah I broke a vow. But what about the other vows? Like promising to love someone for better or for worse? What about How do I know she won't punish me for the rest of my life?
STEVE: The way you treated me and cut me out of your life like that? I mean, yeah I broke a vow. But what about the other vows? Like promising to love someone for better or for worse? What about How do I know she won't punish me for the rest of my life?
THERAPIST: You don't. And she doesn't know for sure that you won't have another All you can know. is that you want to move forward and risk that you love for each other won't allow that to happen. And that's what we'll discover
MIRANDA: So, we're done with our last session and we're not allowed to talk for two weeks while we figure out if being together again is something we really want. And then - - we had to pick a place to meet and if we both show up on that day - - the past no longer exists. Showing up is the promise we make to each other that we're willing to let it all go and move forward.
CARRIE: Can you do that?
MIRANDA: I don't know. I have a lot of thinking to do.
CARRIE: Thinking or feeling?
MIRANDA: What do you mean?
CARRIE: Miranda you're a lawyer. You can argue both sides of any case but, why we feel what we feel isn't logical. It's emotional. Sorry, Harvard I'm afraid you're going to have to make this decision based on your emotions.
MIRANDA: Well, then I'm screwed. I don't know what I feel.
CARRIE: You will. There will come a moment when you'll know. And if it's: yes - - all that brilliant logic will go out the window. with the past.
MIRANDA: And I thought picking the place to meet was a challenge.
CARRIE: Where is it?
MIRANDA: The Brooklyn Bridge. Halfway between both our places.
CARRIE: Very logical. And yet poetic.
MIRANDA: Poetic if we both show up. Otherwise you're on a bridge rejected. Not a good plan.
LOUISE: I have two pieces of good news.
CARRIE: And I have two coffees.
LOUISE: I just got a heads-up from your realtor. The apartment on Fifth finally sold.

DANTE: Want to join me?

SAMANTHA: Did you ever think you'd see the day me with a pooch.
MIRANDA: So, she has a belly. So what?
CARRIE: No, a belly on anyone else is a "so what?" A belly on Samantha is a: "So what the hell is going on?"
CHARLOTTE: She never mentioned it on the Never. And when has she ever not talked about every detail regarding her body?
CARRIE: Never. And when has she ever not talked about every detail regarding her body?
CHARLOTTE: Should we even bring it up?
MIRANDA: What like a fat intervention? "We love you have a salad?" No. We should let her bring it up.
SAMANTHA: Ladies, we can talk about my gut later right now, I'm bored to tears here.
SAMANTHA: I eat so I won't cheat.
MIRANDA: What exactly are you eating?
SAMANTHA: Everything except Dante's dick.
CARRIE: Language, please this is a grown- up apartment now.
SAMANTHA: I guess I didn't realize how big I was until I saw it on your faces.
CARRIE: How and I say this with love How could you not realize it?
SAMANTHA: I've been avoiding mirrors.
CHARLOTTE: I'm proud of you for not cheating.
SAMANTHA: I don't know if there's anything to be proud of. I stuff my face to stop myself from doing something that feels natural to me.
CARRIE: Why didn't you say something?
SAMANTHA: I guess I didn't want to admit it. And when you're in denial you don't dial.
CARRIE: Now, listen this isn't about the weight. You'd be gorgeous at any size. But are you happy?
SAMANTHA: ( Silence; then ) Relationships aren't always about being happy, right? ( beat ) How often do you feel happy in your ( to Charlotte ) I'm pretty sure that's to you.

SMITH: What You don't love me any more?
SAMANTHA: Yes, I love you - ah, fuck it I'm just gonna say the thing you're not supposed to say I love you but I love me more. And I've been in a relationship with myself for forty-nine years and that's the one I need to work on.
SMITH: What will you find?
SAMANTHA: I don't know. But that's a risk I'm willing to take.
STEWARDESS: We're landing in new York. I'm gonna need to take that now.
LOUISE: And I put all the unopened mail from your P.O. Box in the manila envelopes on the bottom shelf
