GORGEOUS GEORGE: What are you doing Tommy?
TOMMY: I am baking a cake Gorgeous, not that i t ' s any of your business. Put the takings down, and be a good chap. Gorgeous isn't too bright and continues to stand there looking stupid. Tommy goes to turn around but can see that he hasn't left, so he turns back,

BRICK TOP: You're a ruthless cunt Liam, I' l l give you that.
TOMMY: Is he allowed to do that?
TURKISH: It's an unlicensed boxing match Tommy, not a tickling competition. These lads are out to hurt each other.
GORGEOUS GEORGE: Oi Turkish, can I have a drink? What do I look like to you George, a fuckin water boy?
TURKISH: What do I look like to you George, a fuckin water boy?

HANDS: Play the game Doug.
DOUG: I am playing the game Hands. That's what I ' l l give ya.
HANDS: You gotta haggle fairly Doug, otherwise it'll make your hair fall out you'll see. .

DOUG: Yes. I was last time·I looked.
ALEX: Well you can't eat shell fish, Dad, i t ' s against your persuasion.
DOUG: What persuasion myself or the prawns belongs to is not the issue, the issue is how a fuckin shrimp managed to sneak in to' my sandwich. He throws the half eaten sandwich out the window.
VINNY: Move it, come on move" i t .
VINNY: Alright Sol, Lincoln.
SOL: It's a mosinite.
SOL: No, a mosinite.
SOL: No, a fuckin mosinite. It's the updated zirconia.
SOL: Zirconias are artificial diamonds, they look pretty good to the novice like you Lincoln. But you could break them with a hammer, so they came up with mosinites.
SOL: I am saying it's worth fuck all.
.SOL: I t ' s worth more than fuck what, but not a lot more.

TOMMY: Calm down, we are buying and then we are off.
GORGEOUS GEORGE: Oh you bastard, I hate fuckin pikies. They arrive in the camp site and the car is immediately surrounded by KIDS. The kids ( most of whom are on bikes ) speak with a sort of Anglo-Irish mix that sounds as rough as the kids look. ,

MICKY: Okay mum okay. You need to sit down.
GORGEOUS GEORGE: You want to stay down my friend, I promise you, you want to stay down. Micky ignores this and continues to pace, the big fella grabs him and puts him in a headlock and charges him into the stable door. There is a terrible noise.
.TURKISH: So you're telling me he would have run you through if Gorgeous hadn't woken up?
TOMMY: No, his Mum stopped it. If his Mum hadn't turned up, well, I ' d be pikey fuckin sausages.
TURKISH: What were you thinking of? Why the fuck did you put Gorgeous George into a bare knuckle boxing match two days before he had to fight the He was half his size.
TOMMY: He was half his size.

TOMMY: John "The Gun?" Or "Mad Fist" Willy?
TURKISH: You're not exactly Mr Current Affairs, are you Tommy? Mad Fist went mad, and the "Gun" shot himself.
TOMMY: What about Clam Hand Tony?
TURKISH: Got his fingers caught in the till. He's no good to anyone.
TOMMY: Why not?
TURKISH: A bare .knuckle boxer isn't a lot of good without any fuckin knuckles,
TOMMY: Let's use the fuckin pikey.
TURKISH: Let's use the fuckin pikey.

HANDS: Do shut up, where is he now?
DOUG: I don't know Hands, I ' m not his mother. But I am seeing him later.
HANDS: He wants cash so he's coming back after he has been to a fight. There is a serious expression of alarm on Hands's face - the camera crashes in.
DOUG: He wants cash so he's coming back after he has been to a fight. There is a serious expression of alarm on Hands's face - the camera crashes in.

TURKISH: You won't know him.
BRICK TOP: Are you taking the piss?
TURKISH: No, there was an accident.
BRICK TOP: I'll show you a fuckin accident.
TURKISH: You've still got your fight.
BRICK TOP: No, I lose all bets at the bookies. You can't change fighters at the last minute, so no, I don't have my fight do I, you fuckin prat!
TOMMY: You could take bets at the fight.
BRICK TOP: Put a lead on her Turkish, Before she gets bitten. Make sure your man goes down in the fourth. You're on thin fuckin ice my pedigree chums and I'll be there if it breaks.
SOL: I am not happy about that dog Vin, you can't bring a dog on a job.
VINNY: You can't leave him on his own, not to begin with, he gets homesick.
SOL: Homesick, for fucks sake.
VINNY: He does. If he gets the chance he runs back to the gypsies' campsite.
SOL: Ohh shut up, how can he find it?
VINNY: I don't know Sol, I am not a dog. Ask him. It' s like he's got a fuckin homing beacon. Give him the chance and he's off.
SOL: You're going soft Vin? Here pass me a sandwich.
VINNY: What have you stopped here for? What's wrong with that space?
TYRONE: It's too tight.
VINNY: What are you talking about, tight? You could land a jumbo fuckin jet in

TYRONE: He swallowed it.
DOUG: Did you get Hands that car?
ALEX: I got him one like it.
DOUG: What do you mean one like it?
ALEX: I got him the Volante.
DOUG: What did I say? What exactly did I You said get him the Vantage.
ALEX: You said get him the Vantage.
DOUG: That's right, I clearly said get him the Vantage. So why did you get the Volante? ;
ALEX: Because they look the same.
DOUG: The Septuagint scholars mistranslated the Hebrew word for "young woman" in to the Greek word for "virgin", because they thought they looked the same, coming up with the prophecy "behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son". But there is a world of difference between a virgin and a young woman like there is between a Volante and a fuckin Vantage.
ALEX: Are you saying that the fact that your cousin Hands is driving a Valiant instead of a Vantage is a profound a mistake as a whole religion?
DOUG: Yes I fuckin am!
DOUG: How about a hug for your old cousin

PAULINE: Does Sir know who this bookies belongs Vinny then leans over the counter to get menacing. Pauline looks more than a little concerned
VINNY: It. belongs to me now.
SOL: Vi nce ? Vince?? He spins round looking for his colleague. A muffled noise tells him to look up. ,

HANDS: I am not looking for Vegas, Doug, I am looking for Franky Four Fingers.

VINNY: I don't believe this. Why are you carrying round a case with this little in it? . .
TYRONE: Tyrone also looks into the case and sees the. open secret compartment: this also reveals the stone.

MICKY: This isn't the same fight.
TURKISH: I t ' s twice the fuckin size of the last one.
MICKY: The fight is twice the size. And my mum still needs a new caravan.
TURKISH: Micky you are lucky we aren't worm food after your performance, I think buying a tart's mobile palace is a little fuckin rich. I didn't mean that your mum was a tart. I just meant.

TOMMY: You saying I can't shoot?
TURKISH: Oh no Tommy I wasn't saying you can't shoot, I know you can't shoot. What I was saying is that six pound piece of shit stuck in your trousers there would do more damage if you fed it to em.

BRICK TOP: Good. That will save me some time Well I don't.
VINNY: Well I don't.
BRICK TOP: What you gonna do with your man there? You're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece. Apparently the best thing to do is cut the corpse up into six pieces and pile it all together.
SOL: Would someone mind telling me who you are?
BRICK TOP: After you got six pieces you gotta get rid of 'em, of course you can't just leave it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, can ya? Pause while the black guys are still holding the body. The door opens and in walks Errol. He passes Brick Top a cup of tea in a take away container.
VINNY: Lincoln, who is this man?
BRICK TOP: And then I hear the best thing to do is feed 'em to pigs. You gotta starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped up body looks like curry to a drunk. You gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out, you could do that after of course, but you don't want to go sieving pig shit do you? Ever seen the size of one of their molars? · He holds up his fist

BRICK TOP: It was a rhetorical question Errol, what have I told you about thinking?
.LINCOLN: Hold on..
