SPECK: The MAN's name is O'RYAN. We only see PIECES of him: his eyes, his hands, a stain on his parka.
O'RYAN: What's in the case?
SPECK: I'm sorry?
O'RYAN: You're always lugging that case around. I'm curious.
SPECK: I'm. in restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name?
O'RYAN: Must travel a lot, huh?
SPECK: I don't mean to be rude but
O'RYAN: How's your wife feel about it?
SPECK: She must get lonely, with you gone all the time. Does she?
O'RYAN: She must get lonely, with you gone all the time. Does she?
SPECK: Look, I.
O'RYAN: Do you get lonely?
SPECK: Listen, I don't know who you are but you
SPECK: You're a. You're sick.
O'RYAN: That's a matter of opinion.
SPECK: You're sick!
MEL: I'm having a problem - with another customer. I'd like you to ask him to leave, please.
SPECK: I'm having a problem - with another customer. I'd like you to ask him to leave, please.
MEL: What kind of problem?
SPECK: He turns, to point out O'Ryan. .but the booth, suddenly, is empty. The guy has simply disappeared, taking those drawings with him. Speck tightens. Mel eyes him, annoyed.
SPECK: ( sheer terror ) What-do-you-want?! What-do-you-want-with-
SPECK: I have some money. It's not a lot but
O'RYAN: Nobody wants your money, Harold. Just pull in.
SPECK: O'Ryan rises into frame now, like Nosferatu.
O'RYAN: Because I don't wanna do this at 70 miles an hour. It could be dangerous.
SPECK: Please, Mister - what do you want from
DAY ): We're looking at the F.B.I.'s "Ten Most-Wanted List." Starkey is #7 on it. He's 40, white. His crime are listed as rape, murder, kidnapping. THOMAS MACKELWAY stares at Starkey's image. At the eyes. Mackelway is 34, bred for success - bred for stardom in fact, a whiz at everything he's ever attempted. So what the hell is he doing in Wichita Falls, Texas.? EIGHT AGENTS, in cubicles, with a ring of outer offices. Quiet phones, lousy take-out options, hardly a dream gig.
MACKELWAY: ( fuck yes ) No, Sir.
CHARLTON: An abandoned SPORTS PAGE tells us about that World Series, so we must be mid-October. Charlton heads out. Mackelway throws a briefcase on to the desk, setting up his world: A framed picture of himself and his BROTHER, ages 10 and 15, on a childhood camping trip. Address book, coffee-warmer, calendar, a baseball covered with autographs. He opens up a drawer, and casually tosses two bottles of BUFFERIN into the back of it. .but first grabs four tablets from one of the bottles, and throws them down his throat, as:
MACKELWAY: I dunno. What are they?
GRIEVES: Welcome to the minors.
MACKELWAY: Fax came in for you. It's the room next Oh. Thanks.
KATIE: Fax came in for you. It's the room next Oh. Thanks.
MACKELWAY: Oh. Thanks.
CHARLTON: Mackelway! You gonna sit on your ass all day, or do you wanna do something?
DYLAN: Afternoon, Rick. Looks like a robbery/homicide. Body's over that way.
MACKELWAY: Ya run the plates?
DYLAN: Fella's name is Harold Speck. Traveling salesman, from Abilene.
MACKELWAY: ( it blurts out )
JUMBO: What's it look like, Bud?
CHARLTON: Did the right thing, Agent Mackelway. Let's have a look.
MACKELWAY: ( to stop him )
CHARLTON: I imagine you would be.
GRANGER: ( aloud ) Hey Jumbo. Toss me down a crowbar.
JUMBO: You said toss it.
MACKELWAY: Hold it a second.
DYLAN: ( re: Mackelway ) Where the hell'd you find this guy?
CHARLTON: Field Office. Dallas.
DYLAN: ( impressed ) Well now. ( Charlton shrugs ) So what the hell's he doin' here?
CHARLTON: Mackelway is expressionless. But something about these LIDLESS EYES draws him closer. He leans in, then BAM! We are rocketed into a series of dark, disjointed images:
JAN: ( through tears ) He was, wasn't he?
O'RYAN: I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
CHARLTON: Agent Mackelway. I was 'bout to introduce you, but I understand that won't be
FRAN: That was terse, from both of them. Charlton takes note.
MACKELWAY: That was terse, from both of them. Charlton takes note.
CHARLTON: I guess we're skipping the tearful reunion. Have a seat, Tom.
MACKELWAY: How's things back at the ranch?
FRAN: Movin' right along.
CHARLTON: Okay. Whadda we know?
FRAN: Picked up a foot-print in the back seat of Speck's car, size-and-a-half bigger than Speck's.
CHARLTON: Wounds on Speck's throat indicate that he was strangled from behind. I think our guy waited for him in the backseat, sprung this on him once the car was
FRAN: Wounds on Speck's throat indicate that he was strangled from behind. I think our guy waited for him in the backseat, sprung this on him once the car was
MACKELWAY: I don't think so, no. I think it was How ya figure?
FRAN: How ya figure?
MACKELWAY: The look of the tracks. Foot-prints near the embankment.
CHARLTON: Okay. So our guy likes to draw pictures of body parts and then spring 'em on people. What's that get us? That's what I thought.
CHARLTON: Oh. 'Fore I forget. This came in for you:
DOLLY: Don't start in on me, Les. I couldn't get the pickup started and Harlan took the
DOLLY: He was a quiet guy. Normal. Liked to read fishing magazines. Not much of a tipper. Is that a lousy thing to say?
FRAN: It's fine.
MACKELWAY: What can you tell us about the other man?
MEL: Like I said, I never really saw him. Harold came up, complainin' about the guy - but time I turned, he was gone.
FRAN: Can you describe him, Ma'am?
DOLLY: Sure. He was.
FRAN: Happen to see what he was driving?
DOLLY: That one's easy. It's still in the lot. The Bonneville out there with the awful paint job.
MACKELWAY: We ought to work out some kind of For what?
FRAN: For what?
MACKELWAY: Interviews. Witnesses. Looks pretty silly, our talking over one another.
FRAN: Fine. I'll handle them from now on.
MACKELWAY: Trunk's ajar.
FRAN: Why eyelids?
MACKELWAY: No other signs of torture here. Why take somebody's eyelids off?
FRAN: No other signs of torture here. Why take somebody's eyelids off?
MACKELWAY: So they can't blink.
FRAN: ( thrown ) You're not wearing your ring anymore.
MACKELWAY: You're not wearing your ring anymore.
MACKELWAY: 26 INT. HOPE HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING 26
DYSON: Benjamin spent hours down here.
MACKELWAY: ( re: lockers ) Did he have access to those?
DYSON: No. They're staff-only.
MACKELWAY: Would you mind opening them for me?
DYSON: Off and on. It's not uncommon for our guests to vanish for months at a time.
MACKELWAY: I ran the name through our database, just to be sure. There's never been an Agent Benjamin O'Ryan in the Bureau.
DYSON: No. but as elaborate fantasies go, it was one of my favorites. And he always seemed so sincere about it.
MACKELWAY: Is that what you called him? Benjamin?
DYSON: It's what he wished to be called.
MACKELWAY: Can I see it?
DYSON: We've painted it over.
MACKELWAY: Still, might be helpful.
PROSECUTOR #1: D'you understand how fucked we are?
MACKELWAY: Yes, Sir.
PROSECUTOR #1: Leaving a tissue sample in the care of a Mexican lab? Are you fucking kidding me?
MACKELWAY: They assured me that they understood Well guess what? They didn't. And this prick's gonna walk, ten murders or not.
PROSECUTOR #1: Well guess what? They didn't. And this prick's gonna walk, ten murders or not.
MACKELWAY: Dyson extends six pages. On the TOP-SHEET, written by hand, are the words: "Agent Thomas Mackelway, C/O Mr. David Dyson, Hope House" with a street address. And under that top sheet? Five more pages. Mackelway sighs, takes them from Dyson. Sure enough, he's staring at five more faces, five more fact sheets. Five more HAVE YOU SEEN ME's. But how would anyone know to send them here?
DYSON: Anything urgent?
MACKELWAY: ( doesn't look up )
PIPER: Ever seen a fifty-foot shark?
MACKELWAY: I'm sorry?
PIPER: Fifty-foot shark. Ever seen one?
MACKELWAY: Doesn't mean there aren't any.
PIPER: Doesn't mean there aren't any.
MACKELWAY: Did you know him? The guy who used to stay upstairs. "O'Ryan." Did you know him?
PIPER: Why? Is he dead?
MACKELWAY: I don't.
PIPER: You said "Did." Is he dead?
MACKELWAY: Oh. I mis-spoke. No, he's not dead. You know him?
PIPER: That's not a circle. It's a zero.
MACKELWAY: Oh. How do you know?
LORETTA: ( re: song ) How's that?
BARTENDER: Little cute for my taste, but I can stand three minutes of it.
LORETTA: I'll have a seven and seven, please.
BARTENDER: Seven and seven. Got some i.d.?
LORETTA: It's in the car. No one's asked me for it for a couple years now.
BARTENDER: If ya hurry, you'll still catch the end of the song.
LORETTA: Please, Mister.
O'RYAN: Hey, listen, I'm sorta new in town. Ya know where I can find a good donkey show?
STARKEY: Oh. Forgot. Wrong country. In America animals have rights. Don't they, Virgil?
O'RYAN: Oh. Forgot. Wrong country. In America animals have rights. Don't they, Virgil?
STARKEY: How the fuck should I know?
O'RYAN: ( at Loretta ) Turn around.
LORETTA: I don't think the eyes are right.
COMPOSITE ARTIST: No, they were. I don't really know. We got an i.d. yet?
LORETTA: No, they were. I don't really know. We got an i.d. yet?
MACKELWAY: ( Charlton turns ) We got an i.d. yet?
CHARLTON: ( Mackelway waits ) Might wanna find yourself a fender. You're gonna need to sit down. ( Mackelway's still waiting ) It's Virgil Ray Starkey.
MACKELWAY: ( struggling for composure: ) Starkey did this?
CHARLTON: No. Starkey's the one on the ground.
MACKELWAY: ( breathless ) My God.
GRIEVES: Gonna make a wallet-size of that one?
CHARLTON: Give him a break, Grieves.
MACKELWAY: 'Scuse me.
CHARLTON: Whadda we know about the map?
MACKELWAY: It matches the faxes, Sir. Almost
CHARLTON: Why's Greenville in blue?
MACKELWAY: Only city where the date on the fax and the date on the map didn't correspond.
CHARLTON: Any of these bodies been recovered?
MACKELWAY: Two so far. Female, disappeared from Dayton, Ohio on April 12. And a male, Trenton, New Jersey, January 5th.
CHARLTON: Either of the bodies have the zero on No, Sir.
MACKELWAY: No, Sir.
FRAN: Why you?
MACKELWAY: He could be sending these to any agent in any office in the country. But he's sending them to you. Why?
FRAN: He could be sending these to any agent in any office in the country. But he's sending them to you. Why?
MACKELWAY: I don't know.
MACKELWAY: ( eagerly ) Yeah. Criminal Psych. I've been trading e- mails with him.
MACKELWAY: Professor Daitz?
O'RYAN: ( as "Daitz:" ) .The name of this theory was "Suspect ( Mackelway nods ) The idea of Suspect Zero posits that if a serial killer were diabolical enough, he could traverse the country without ever being caught, killing randomly.
MACKELWAY: Patterns, repetition of behavior.
O'RYAN: Now imagine a killer with no patterns, no tell-tale fetishes, no rituals, no hidden desire to be caught. A perfect vessel of evil, killing without ever leaving a single meaningful clue in his wake. He'd be immune to capture, wouldn't he? Your task forces, your forensics teams - they'd be helpless.
MACKELWAY: Is that something you believe in, Professor? Evil?
O'RYAN: As a citizen of the world, it's hard not to. Wouldn't you say? Evil is all around us, I think - a part of the natural order of things. Like gravity. Like wind. A vast black wave, corrupting everything it touches. A virus invades a cell, causing it to dysfunction. Perfectly logical. But did it ever occur to you that something may have invaded that virus, something capable of using it to mutate so
MACKELWAY: I'm sorry?
O'RYAN: A shark, as we know, will only attack humans if he runs out of food. But biologists have theorized that for a shark of fifty feet the ocean would be an endless buffet. He'd never run out of food, so he'd have no need to come to the surface. Consequently, we would never see him. Do you follow? We'll never see one. But that doesn't mean they don't exist. Hence Suspect
COED: Oh. I'm sorry. I was looking for Just like that, O'Ryan has bolted past the Coed, literally tossing her onto Mackelway, exploding into the hall. She screams. Mackelway grabs her, moves her aside as gently as time allows, then blows out of the room.
FRAN: How ya doin'?
CHARLTON: We're gonna need everything you can remember about this guy, Tom. Physical description, any kind of distinguishing
MACKELWAY: ( scratchy ) Where is he?
CHARLTON: The suspect fled. Couple janitors walked in on it.
MACKELWAY: His, Sir.
CHARLTON: Uh-huh. Did he ask you to come alone?
MACKELWAY: No, Sir.
CHARLTON: But you figured you'd get a bigger pat on the head if you wrapped this whole thing up without any help - is that it?
FRAN: Sir, I'm the one who took the call. Agent Mackelway was acting under the assumption that I'd already checked the guy out. We're both to blame.
CHARLTON: Did Agent Mackelway attend the interview Yes, Sir.
FRAN: ( reluctantly ) Yes, Sir.
CHARLTON: Then whose fuck-up is it?
MACKELWAY: ( at Charlton ) It was. poor judgment, Sir.
CHARLTON: You wanna work alone, start your own
MOTHER: Girls, I want you to come in now. Startin' to rain.
KATIE: ( softly ) I can't anymore.
KATIE: Can't sleep?
MACKELWAY: What was that music?
KATIE: It's Navajo. A song for dead warriors. I never played it for anybody before.
MACKELWAY: I dunno. The way you stare when you think nobody's looking.
KATIE: I dunno. The way you stare when you think nobody's looking.
FRAN: What're you
MACKELWAY: I can't get a read on this guy.
FRAN: Why is he sending us all this shit? I've got 800 pins in that map, 800 missing people. What's he telling us?
MACKELWAY: Why is he sending us all this shit? I've got 800 pins in that map, 800 missing people. What's he telling us?
FRAN: You're a mess.
MACKELWAY: I'm fine. I'm clear. I just didn't think this could wait. Fran, this guy is trying to point us at something. Starkey's part of it. But the other two don't connect.
FRAN: Did you drive here?
MACKELWAY: I'm fine! I just need somebody to think this through with me! He wanted to meet me. It's like he was interviewing me somehow. What is that? Then he kills Starkey. So what was he doing with Speck and Fulcher?
FRAN: You wanna come in?
MACKELWAY: No. No. You come out. Get dressed.
FRAN: Out where?
MACKELWAY: I dunno. Somewhere. We're right on the edge of this thing.
FRAN: I'm going back to bed. You're welcome to the couch if you want. I think you could do with some sleep.
JAN: ( hoping for good news: ) Agent Mackelway?
MACKELWAY: ( all business ) Mrs. Speck. Just had a few more
JAN: I'm sorry I don't have more time, Agent Mackelway. It's my PTA Day.
MACKELWAY: It's fine. I should've called.
JAN: I hope I was of some help.
MACKELWAY: You were. Thanks.
JAN: A friend of mine said I'll feel like this one month for every year we were together. Sort of a grieving rule-of- thumb. Have you ever heard that?
MACKELWAY: ( gently ) No. Sorry.
JAN: No. Why?
MACKELWAY: It's nothing. Trace elements we found on his trunk. Any interest in chemistry? Maybe as a hobby?
JAN: No trouble at all.
MACKELWAY: ( calmly ) It's okay, Fellas. FBI.
CHARLTON: Listen to me Cowboy. You have any idea the kind of favors I had to pull with the Abilene cops to cover your ass?!
MACKELWAY: ( not allowing him to talk ) Breaking and ENTERING the Speck house without a shred of evidence and NO
CHARLTON: ( not allowing him to talk ) Breaking and ENTERING the Speck house without a shred of evidence and NO
WARRANT?!: ( not going down without a The sample I took from Speck's bumper. It's crystallized sulfuric acid mixed with oil of Clove, the clove neutralizes the odor of the acid.
MACKELWAY: ( not going down without a The sample I took from Speck's bumper. It's crystallized sulfuric acid mixed with oil of Clove, the clove neutralizes the odor of the acid.
CHARLTON: Ever ask yourself why a big shot agent from Dallas gets sent down to the Wichita Falls Field Office? I'll give you TWO WORDS. Hell I'll even write it down for ya.
GRIEVES: ( passing by ) Nice job, Mack.
MACKELWAY: A few OTHER AGENTS also pat him on the back. Fran's proud of him too - we can see it. In fact everyone in here seems to be giving Mackelway his due. It all feels good. Charlton enters.
CHARLTON: Seated please.
MACKELWAY: ( fondly ) Somethin', huh? Guy with a wife and kids keepin' bodies in his attic?
KATIE: Somethin', huh? Guy with a wife and kids keepin' bodies in his attic?
MACKELWAY: ( a beat ) You okay?
KATIE: Yeah. Just. Wondered if you could do me a favor.
MACKELWAY: ( gently ) Sure. Of course.
KATIE: Thanks. 'Night.
TROOPER: Evening, Officer.
O'RYAN: Evening, Officer.
TROOPER: See your license, Sir?
O'RYAN: 'Course. Is there a problem?
TROOPER: See your registration, please?
O'RYAN: O'Ryan opens up the glove compartment, starts searching through it. But it's a stall, that's obvious.
TROOPER: Mind stepping out of the car, please?
O'RYAN: Officer, I am carrying something that could be construed as a weapon. I'd like to hand it over, voluntarily, so you won't think I'm trying to conceal anything. Would that be all right?
TROOPER: What kind of weapon, Sir?
O'RYAN: It's a hunting knife, right here on my I was on my way to the woods. My gear's in the trunk. Would you like me to hand it to you? I don't know what the procedure is for something like this.
TROOPER: Take the weapon off your hip, place it on the ground, and kick it toward me.
O'RYAN: Happy to.
TROOPER: What exactly were you planning on hunting, Sir?
O'RYAN: A fifty-foot shark.
TROOPER: ( kneeling ) That right?
O'RYAN: Mmm-hmmm. FBI. 'Course this was some years ago.
TROOPER: Had anything to drink tonight, Sir? Under medication of any kind?
O'RYAN: Oh. Sorry. Just found myself wondering what was inside that truck.
TROOPER: Sir, I'm going to ask you to hand me the keys to your vehicle, please.
O'RYAN: Of course.
FRAN: O'Ryan. He left his file on my doorstep. Fran, he was FBI.
MACKELWAY: O'Ryan. He left his file on my doorstep. Fran, he was FBI.
FRAN: That's impossible.
MACKELWAY: I'm look at his whole history! Citations, letters of commendation, even his fucking test scores from Quantico. The guy was an agent.
FRAN: I don't believe it.
MACKELWAY: Listen to me
MACKELWAY: Where are you?
FRAN: He called you at home?
MACKELWAY: BEEP. Call-Waiting again.
FRAN: Jesus. Call me back.
MACKELWAY: Zero's a myth. You made him up.
O'RYAN: Zero's a myth. You made him up.
MACKELWAY: Zero's a myth. You made him up.
O'RYAN: Myths don't kidnap little boys. Do they?
MACKELWAY: Do you?
O'RYAN: Was she pretty?
MACKELWAY: I could hear her moaning, right under the Navajo chanting. Whole thing was downright tribal. What's she look like?
O'RYAN: I could hear her moaning, right under the Navajo chanting. Whole thing was downright tribal. What's she look like?
MACKELWAY: ( calmly ) You tell me.
O'RYAN: Fair enough. We'll stick to business: How'd ya like my old room?
MACKELWAY: "Hope House." You were there.
O'RYAN: "Hope House." You were there.
MACKELWAY: Yeah. White.
O'RYAN: .But you saw what was underneath, of No. Tell me about it.
MACKELWAY: No. Tell me about it.
O'RYAN: No. You tell me.
DYSON: Welcome back.
DYSON: I'll be in my office.
MACKELWAY: ( knows already ) But the Trooper wasn't hurt.
CHARLTON: What makes you so sure?
MACKELWAY: Professional courtesy.
CHARLTON: Looks like it.
MACKELWAY: I couldn't understand it before - pushing Speck's car onto the state line. Makes sense now. He wanted to make the case Federal. He's drawing us in.
CHARLTON: Why would he do that?
MACKELWAY: So we'd be paying attention when he found Suspect Zero.
CHARLTON: Ya know what? I'm getting extremely tired of hearing that word. In fact, that's gonna be policy from now on. No Zero.
MACKELWAY: Sir, profile the guy. He's straight outta Quantico. All he's doing is working a case, like we would. He's not kidnapping little kids - he's chasing the guy who's doing the kidnapping! Look at the map!
CHARLTON: What're you saying - that all these abductions are the work of one guy? Do you know how fucking insane that is?! Not let's try something that actually makes sense: He sends in these faxes, picks off three scumbags. For what?! So we'll think exactly what you're thinking right now - that we've got a friend out there, somebody willing to take out the garbage for the rest of us. And it's all What if it isn't? What if there really is a Zero out there and O'Ryan's the one guy who's got a shot at him?
MACKELWAY: What if it isn't? What if there really is a Zero out there and O'Ryan's the one guy who's got a shot at him?
CHARLTON: ( just blew his top ) Fuck's sake, Mackelway - when did you start buying into this guy?!
MACKELWAY: ( quietly ) He's smarter than we are.
CHARLTON: Speak for yourself.
MACKELWAY: Sir? What if I told you I knew how to catch him?
CHARLTON: Do you?
MACKELWAY: And what if I told you that the way I'd catch him involved sitting in a dark room, with nothing in front of me but a pad of paper. until I'd tapped into some kind of. energy out there. The collective unconscious. Something. If I told you I thought I could target and
CHARLTON: I'd say you'd watched too many "X-Files."
MACKELWAY: Y'ever heard of a project called "Icarus," Sir?
CHARLTON: Mackelway tosses over a few pages from O'Ryan's file.
MACKELWAY: Agents, trained to "see" distant locations using nothing but the mind. They called it Remote Viewing.
CHARLTON: Good for him.
MACKELWAY: Voodoo, right? Pure Bullshit. .except, it worked. It's how he drew
CHARLTON: I'm going to Denton at Oh-Six-Hundred. You can take the day off.
FRAN: I'm sorry?
CHARLTON: It's not a strength of his. I'm noticing that lately.
FRAN: He's fine.
CHARLTON: I'm not so sure. You oughtta sit him down, remind him how a chain-of-command works.
FRAN: He's fine, Sir.
CHARLTON: Talk to him.
MACKELWAY: They going to Denton?
FRAN: But not you?
MACKELWAY: But not you?
FRAN: Sitting in on two autopsies.
MACKELWAY: He rises. Heads for the door, stiff. She looks at those O'Ryan FBI DOCUMENTS NOW - her first time seeing them.
FRAN: You okay?
MACKELWAY: Yeah. Why?
FRAN: She leaves it at that. He's about to exit, when:
MACKELWAY: Are they male or female?
FRAN: The autopsies.
MACKELWAY: The autopsies.
FRAN: Females - Logan, Utah; and Decatur,
MACKELWAY: Sometimes. The lucky ones get sent to Wichita Falls.
FRAN: The Receptionist.
MACKELWAY: Her name's Katie.
FRAN: I see you got the blue pin out of Yeah. Last night. Kid named Simms.
MACKELWAY: Yeah. Last night. Kid named Simms.
FRAN: ( re: Sumpter ) No. I meant her. The girl.
MACKELWAY: What're you talking about?
FRAN: Did ya look at her vitals?
MACKELWAY: Need an address on this fax line.
GRIEVES: Mackelway leans back in to the O'Ryan Room.
MACKELWAY: O'Ryan's in Greenville.
FRAN: What makes you think so?
MACKELWAY: That's where Zero is. Lloyd Simms - October 26, '99. Karen Sumpter - October 26, 2000. Both disappeared from Greenville. Zero comes back to the same spot, once a year. Today's the 25th.
FRAN: Wait. When did we establish that Zero was O'Ryan thinks so.
MACKELWAY: O'Ryan thinks so.
FRAN: Do you?
MACKELWAY: I've seen this before.
FRAN: He doesn't answer, just hurries to a thick BOX OF OTHER AUTOPSY FILES AND PHOTOS. Starts rifling through them. .until he finds the one we've seen before. The body from Trenton. He extracts it. Eyes it. A confirmation. He lays the two PHOTOS side by side. Looks to Fran.
MACKELWAY: Same burn-mark. I saw it before but it didn't register.
FRAN: He burns them?
MACKELWAY: I dunno. Almost looks too symmetrical to be a burn. They're autopsying her this morning?
FRAN: She gets the idea: "Find out where the hell this mark on the leg came from." Grieves enters.
GRIEVES: Fax number traces back to a Copy Center on I-30. Greenville. I called. They don't open for another
MACKELWAY: He sent a fax from this location 'bout seven o'clock this morning.
MACKELWAY: Are your faxes programmable? Could he have paid last night to have it sent this Sure. But that costs extra.
MACKELWAY: Were you here last night?
MACKELWAY: 'Scuse me.
FRAN: It's not a burn. It's a freezer-burn.
MACKELWAY: You're sure.
FRAN: There's crystallization in the blood stream. The blood never clotted in the wound. It's a freezer burn. I'm having the other body shipped out - the guy from Trenton. We'll see if he's got the same
MACKELWAY: So. he keeps the bodies in a freezer, then buries them.?
FRAN: I dunno. If he kept them in a freezer they'd have marks like this all over. Wouldn't they?
MACKELWAY: Thanks, Fran.
WAITRESS: You want some more breakfast, Honey, or are we just rollin' right on into lunch?
MACKELWAY: Just some coffee, thanks. Might hit the buffet in a bit.
WAITRESS: Meatloaf's lookin' good today.
MACKELWAY: Surveilling. What're you doing?
FRAN: Driving to Greenville.
MACKELWAY: ( knows already ) Why would you be doing that?
FRAN: I think agents are safer when they have some company. I can send along Katie if you'd rather.
MACKELWAY: I'm at the truck-stop we traced. Off the
FRAN: I'm 'bout a half hour out.
MACKELWAY: I'll order some lunch for you. Hear the meatloaf's good today.
MACKELWAY: He honks - loud - pulls around that other 18-wheeler, heading for the exit of the lot. Just spotted Vic's rig again.
MACKELWAY: You okay? Kid? You okay in there?
O'RYAN: Well, well. Must be quite a moment for you. Congratulations.
MACKELWAY: What're you doing here?
O'RYAN: Waiting for you.
WOMAN: Morning, Baby!
VIC: I told you she'd be here. He's been a brat all morning.
MACKELWAY: ( at O'Ryan ) Hands up.
O'RYAN: ( disappointed ) Awfully conventional - don't ya think?
MACKELWAY: Apprehend the fugitive, then call it in for your pat on the head.
O'RYAN: Apprehend the fugitive, then call it in for your pat on the head.
MACKELWAY: Sorry to disappoint you.
O'RYAN: I'll get over it. But I'm not too sure that little boy
MACKELWAY: ( minor test ) What little boy?
O'RYAN: The one from the Diner, in Denton.
MACKELWAY: You know where he is?
O'RYAN: I can find him.
MACKELWAY: Same way I found Starkey, and Speck, and Fulcher. and you.
O'RYAN: Same way I found Starkey, and Speck, and Fulcher. and you.
MACKELWAY: I can't do that.
O'RYAN: Then I can't help you.
MACKELWAY: Where's the boy?
O'RYAN: I won't be doing this much longer. Actually, this is the end of it. I've
MACKELWAY: ( anger rising ) Where's the boy, O'Ryan?
O'RYAN: Do we have an understanding?
O'RYAN: Good. This is good. Sort of thing you'd never find in a procedural manual. It tells me I was right about you.
MACKELWAY: ( cocking the hammer ) I will kill you, O'Ryan.
O'RYAN: I know. But we have work to do first.
MACKELWAY: Where's the Goddamn kid?!?!
O'RYAN: Don't pick that up.
MACKELWAY: Fine. Where is he? Where is he?!?!
O'RYAN: Right here.
MACKELWAY: Fuck you.
O'RYAN: Are you afraid?
MACKELWAY: Where's the boy?
O'RYAN: ( re: the mirror ) My, my. Must be extremely satisfying to watch yourself say something so heroic. I'm almost envious.
O'RYAN: ( softly ) Stand up.
O'RYAN: ( re: gun ) Soon. I promise. But not yet.
MACKELWAY: Tell me about Icarus.
O'RYAN: Just. wanna know.
MACKELWAY: Just. wanna know.
O'RYAN: There were five of us. In the program.
MACKELWAY: They all wind up like you? The other No. They're dead now.
O'RYAN: No. They're dead now.
MACKELWAY: I'm sorry.
O'RYAN: We're here.
MACKELWAY: Can't bring you in with me. You know
O'RYAN: All of 'em.
MACKELWAY: It's his birthday, isn't it?
MACKELWAY: He accidentally burns himself on the super-heated chain.
O'RYAN: Can't let him hit the Interstate.
MACKELWAY: ( over his shoulder, running ) Get the van open! He's got a kid in the
ZERO: ( re: Mackelway ) Glad you're here, Man. Guy was about to kill me.
MACKELWAY: I'll take it from here. Are you going to shoot him?
O'RYAN: Are you going to shoot him?
MACKELWAY: Give me the gun, O'Ryan.
ZERO: Hey, I just surrendered.
O'RYAN: Shut up.
ZERO: I surrendered! That's it!
O'RYAN: SHUT UP!!!
SHUT UP!!!: O'Ryan wheels around, aiming the gun right at Zero's face. That shuts the guy up in a hurry.
MACKELWAY: ( that stung ) Give me the fucking gun!
O'RYAN: ( at Mackelway ) You have to understand: none of this was arbitrary. We were chosen, you and I.
MACKELWAY: Okay. You made your point.
O'RYAN: Bullshit! If I'd made my fucking point you would've shot him yourself by now!
MACKELWAY: Then, an odd thing. O'Ryan simply smiles. Something about having that gun pointed right at him - it's a
O'RYAN: Or what?
MACKELWAY: Just drop it.
O'RYAN: Would you shoot me?
MACKELWAY: Put it down.
O'RYAN: ( calmly ) I want you to think for a second. About your destiny. Who you are. You're cursed, like I am - except you keep running from ( Mackelway's silent ) You hear things. You see things. That's why you can't sleep, why your head always .and it's why you are going to let me kill this animal. And then you're going to kill me.
MACKELWAY: Get up.
O'RYAN: I can't do that, Mack. I've seen all this already. For months now.
MACKELWAY: Get up.
O'RYAN: Every time, we're in this field: same wind, same rain. And you.
O'RYAN: I'm tired, Mack.
O'RYAN: Pull the trigger. I'm not going to jail. Now pull the fucking trigger!
O'RYAN: Shut it off for me.
MACKELWAY: I'm not going to kill you, O'Ryan.
O'RYAN: Of course you will. I've seen it.
MACKELWAY: You saw wrong!
O'RYAN: ( incredulous ) That's impossible.
O'RYAN: ( rambling, unraveling ) You don't understand. Those fucking faces
MACKELWAY: Stop telling me about my fucking destiny!
O'RYAN: ( again ) But I've seen it!
MACKELWAY: Open your eyes, O'Ryan! Here I am, standing here. I'm not shooting you. Doesn't that fucking tell you something? You're a guy with a skill. Period. They taught you more than they should've. I'm sorry about that. But you're not God. You can't see everything.
O'RYAN: Yes I can! And you can too! That's why I chose you!
O'RYAN: ( re: tire-iron ) Fine. I'll make it easy for you: Put the fucking thing down, O'Ryan.
MACKELWAY: Put the fucking thing down, O'Ryan.
O'RYAN: Look. It's perfect. Won't even need a hearing this way. You apprehended the suspect in the commission of a murder. Then he turned on you and you fired in
MACKELWAY: I'm not going to kill you!
O'RYAN: You don't get to decide that!
MACKELWAY: Yes I do!
FREEZE!!!: Silence. Mackelway turns. So does O'Ryan. There's Fran, emerging from the tall wheat, gun trained right on O'Ryan. His shock is total.
O'RYAN: ( at Mackelway, surprised ) It's funny. I never saw anyone else out here. Did you?
MACKELWAY: I can't.
O'RYAN: Two men, neither of them flinching. until O'Ryan nods - as if to say "Good-bye." .more of that vision interrupts now: a gun, rising. O'Ryan rears back and swings that tire-iron right at Mackelway's head. Fran has no choice. She fires. O'Ryan is hit right between the shoulder blades. The tire-iron hits Mackelway in the shoulder. O'Ryan crumbles to the ground, landing face up. .a body slumping to the ground. O'Ryan. Mackelway stands over him. Now, real-life again, Mackelway stands over O'Ryan, just as O'Ryan had always envisioned it. That makes him smile, even as he's dying.
CHARLTON: Nice work. Where is he?
MACKELWAY: O'Ryan. Where is he?
CHARLTON: O'Ryan. Where is he?
