NANCY: Something's off.
TERESA: We can do better.
KUJO: So the alphabet, I mean look at it, there's 26 letters. Why not 27 or 28 or 106? And the vowels: a, e, i, o, u. What the hell is up with that?
CREEPER: And sometimes y.
KUJO: What I'm saying is that I love it! It's great. I could go on all night about it. Let's take every letter individually. I mean, let's really break the mother's down.

JIMMY: Guess it's our turn.

TANNER: You go, boy.
DANNY: If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
TANNER: Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
DANNY: Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
TANNER: You got a name?
DANNY: Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
TANNER: Never mind. Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
DANNY: Never mind. Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
TANNER: No last name?
DANNY: It was all pretty informal. Didn't have a lot of time to exchange This the guy?
GARCETTI: This the guy?
DANNY: It speaks! That's him. He's a lot prettier in person though.
DANNY: That's him. He's a lot prettier in person though.
GARCETTI: Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
DANNY: Dude is bugging. Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
GARCETTI: What's he holding?
DANNY: Yeah. Pretty sure. Oh yeah . he had a spear gun, too.
TANNER: God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
DANNY: Somebody has to help you lazy bastards. Hey Tanner . you be careful, okay?
TANNER: Danny, I'm touched.
DANNY: Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
GARCETTI: Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
DANNY: Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
GARCETTI: I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch. You're a bottom feader, Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
DANNY: Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
DANNY: You're welcome.
DANNY: ( approaching ) Let me help you with those. ( loud through the door ) And to think Miss Manner was living down the hall from me and I didn't even know it! Hey, you left a can of .

DANNY: My name is Tom Van Allen I play the trumpet. My name is Tom Van Allen. I play the trumpet.
LIZ: That's so .
LIZ: Yes, it hurts my heart. What a beautiful composition.
LIZ: ( goofing ) A virtuoso rendition. TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
LIZ: And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
LIZ: I was talking about Miles.
LIZ: And you've got wiener breath.
LIZ: It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
LIZ: ( laughing ) Tom! Gross!
LIZ: Tom, let's spend the night here.
LIZ: No. Right here on the beach. Come on. Let's do it.
DANNY: ( at the vanity, whispering ) Okay, we'll stay. We'll stay.
DANNY: ( at the vanity, softly ) No . We'll stay.
DANNY: You think I'm a Judas?
TANNER: Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
DANNY: Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
TANNER: Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins. I'm serious. He hates 'em. You ever hear of anyone who didn't like dolphins?
DANNY: Thanks for not judging me.
TANNER: It's not my place.
DANNY: Don't you wonder why I do it?
TANNER: The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
DANNY: You don't find that repugnant?
TANNER: Just the way the world works. Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy. You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
DANNY: Tell that to Bobby . and his wife and kid.
TANNER: Bobby laid his own tracks. He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him. Now take the money. One think I do want to know is how the hell did you get yourself into this position to start with? You seem like a smart enough guy.
DANNY: It's a long story. Maybe I'll tell you all about it some day. Hey, Garcetti . You ever get confused and try to flush yourself? You tell him?
TANNER: I was getting to it.
DANNY: ( to Tanner ) Tell me what?
GARCETTI: I'll tell him.
DANNY: ( worried ) Tell me what?
GARCETTI: ( mock concern ) Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
DANNY: Yeah. What about him?
GARCETTI: Turns out he's connected.
DANNY: To who?
GARCETTI: The Mexicali Boys
DANNY: And what does this have to do with me?
GARCETTI: He knows somebody ratted him.
DANNY: And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was. You know that thing where they slit your throat and pull your tongue out of the hole. Apparently they call it a necktie because it hangs down about yay long and looks very similar to a tie. Isn't that weird, Danny? Isn't that Shut up, Garcetti!

DANNY: Shut up, Garcetti!
DANNY: If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
TANNER: Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you. Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people. And if you're that worried about it, maybe you ought to get out of town.
DANNY: How the hell am I gonna do that? You guys are still stringing me a long on that possession charge.
GARCETTI: ( mock surprise ) You mean that hasn't been cleared up yet?
DANNY: Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
GARCETTI: Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
TANNER: Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
DANNY: Soon. I promise. We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear. In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
TANNER: Soon. I promise. We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear. In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
DANNY: ( checking out the painting ) Ride 'em cowboy )

BUBBA: Get in, hoss. We'll talk it over.
DANNY: Jimmy, you don't look so hot.
JIMMY: I'm hurting.
DANNY: You on a roll?
JIMMY: Was. I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man. You got anything for Why does it have to feel so bad?
DANNY: Why does it have to feel so bad?
JIMMY: Why does it have to feel so bad?
DANNY: You're brain is in reverse mode . cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here. Have a beer. You see the crank bugs?
JIMMY: Oh yeah. Man, Danny, how do you keep your shit together so tight?
DANNY: That's a good one.
JIMMY: I'm serious, dude. You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
DANNY: I guess there's just no substitute for good genes. You hear about Bobby?
JIMMY: Yeah, it's a pity. Truly a pity. He was a good supplier. You think maybe there's any drugs left in his room? You know, like I kind of doubt it, Jimmy.
DANNY: I kind of doubt it, Jimmy.
JIMMY: So, why'd you want to see me?
DANNY: Business. I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
JIMMY: See that? That's just what I'm talking about.
DANNY: You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit. You got language skills, man.
JIMMY: You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit. You got language skills, man.
DANNY: Don't get carried away.
JIMMY: I find myself in dire need of some cash.
DANNY: You remember that guy you told me about . said he could handle a big Yeah, Pooh-Bear. Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
JIMMY: Yeah, Pooh-Bear. Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.

DANNY: A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
JIMMY: Can your man handle that?
DANNY: Can your man handle that?
JIMMY: I think so. I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
DANNY: Can you set that up?
JIMMY: Jimmy sucks what's left of his beer down.
DANNY: I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.

JIMMY: You mean, like to throw 'em off?
DANNY: Yeah, that's what I mean. Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
JIMMY: Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?

JIMMY: He doesn't have one.
DANNY: You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.

COLETTE: Oh God.
DANNY: Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
COLETTE: I don't know .. you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen. See. No matter how bad things are, there's always someone a little worse off.
DANNY: I don't know .. you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen. See. No matter how bad things are, there's always someone a little worse off.
COLETTE: What about the guy on the very bottom?
DANNY: Leave me out of this.
COLETTE: That bad, huh?
DANNY: Nevertheless, I still try to see the glass as half-full. Problem is, it's usually half-full of something that tastes a lot like urine.
COLETTE: Could be worse. Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
DANNY: Colette sips her coffee. Danny looks around nervously. Colette frowns, not sure what he means.
COLETTE: Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
DANNY: This man sounds like a real catch.
COLETTE: Oh, he's a keeper all right.
DANNY: Colette .
COLETTE: Go ahead.
DANNY: Go ahead.
COLETTE: Go ahead.

DANNY: Then leave.
COLETTE: I can't.
DANNY: Why not?

COLETTE: I can't leave.
DANNY: You get off on abuse or Fuck you.
COLETTE: Fuck you.
DANNY: Then why don't you leave? Just give me one good reason.
COLETTE: Because he'll kill me. Is that simple enough for you?
DANNY: Why don't you call the cops?
COLETTE: Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
DANNY: That's long enough to get out of town.
COLETTE: I can't. I've got a kid. She lives with my parents. Quincey knows where they live.
DANNY: Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
COLETTE: Danny hesitates, not sure of how much he wants to get involved.
DANNY: I don't know. Let me think about it.
BUBBA: ( Texas drawl ) I wanna do a small buy first. Ten thousand. We'll see how it goes.
DANNY: Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
BUBBA: Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.

GARCETTI: You thinking what I'm thinking?
TANNER: Yeah. This could be the one we're looking for.
TANNER: Hold it right there, Flynne.
DANNY: Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack!
DANNY: What the hell are you doing here?
TANNER: Question is, what are you doing here?
DANNY: I was trying to score some dope.
TANNER: Cut the shit, Flynne.
DANNY: Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
TANNER: Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
DANNY: ( serious ) What did I do?! This is a joke, right? You put him up to this, Garcetti? Come on Tanner . don't .
TANNER: ( shrieking, failing ) You think this is funny motherfucker?
DANNY: ( still laughing and covering up ) I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl. Garcetti, do something.
DANNY: Garcetti, do something.
GARCETTI: We know what's going on.
DANNY: ( in pain ) I still don't know what you're talking about.
GARCETTI: Okay, let me help you. You're setting up a deal with a Chinese redneck. Quarter of a million. We just listened to the whole thing. Somebody tipped up, dipshit.
DANNY: Who the hell is Jimmy?
GARCETTI: Who the hell is Jimmy?
DANNY: He's the only one I told.
GARCETTI: And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne. Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
DANNY: I met the guy at a party. He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
TANNER: This chink have a name?
DANNY: Tanner rolls his eyes.
TANNER: You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
DANNY: After that ass-whipping you gave me?
GARCETTI: ( finishing up with the bundle ) What's on the other end of this thing?
DANNY: Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy . goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
GARCETTI: Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
DANNY: Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
TANNER: What're your taking down?
DANNY: Standard vig. Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
TANNER: Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
DANNY: Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear. I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him. But now I've seen the error of my ways. I'll just walk away . call the whole deal off.
GARCETTI: He tosses the bundle of cash to Danny.
DANNY: You mean you want me to roll on these guys? No. No way. These guys catch a whiff and I'm a fucking bag of Bandini.
TANNER: You've got no choice.
DANNY: Whata you mean I've got no choice?
TANNER: Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande .
DANNY: For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
TANNER: No. You just handed us a new one. We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank. What's the mandatory on that, Al?
GARCETTI: Dime, minimum.
GARCETTI: What's that smell?
DANNY: That would be me.
GARCETTI: What'd you do, piss your pants?
DANNY: Hell, yes! What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
GARCETTI: Who'd have thought it? Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
DANNY: Lay off, Garcetti. I'm not in the mood.
GARCETTI: No. You've got me all wrong. I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
TANNER: Bullshit. He's a liar.
DANNY: News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
TANNER: You think you're so god damned smart, don't you? Well, you played the wrong mark this time, asshole.
LIZ: Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
LIZ: You mean like the Donner Party?
LIZ: Tom, quit fucking around.
LIZ: You think that's a good idea?
LIZ: Look at that place. It's creepy.
LIZ: I wanted you to ask back there. You know, before you got us lost.
LIZ: Just admit you're wrong.
LIZ: Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
LIZ: Here it comes, poor Tom.
LIZ: That is so unfair.
LIZ: Why are you doing this? I never once asked you to stop playing. I wouldn't dream of it. So don't take your low self-esteem out on me.
LIZ: . Tom . screw it. Tell me when you're ready to apologize.
DANNY: ( on the bed, whispering ) I'm sorry, Liz. I love you and I'm sorry.
DANNY: Oh. Hi.
COLETTE: What happened to your eye?
DANNY: Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure. By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set. Where's Quincey?
COLETTE: Don't worry. He's out of town.
DANNY: How far out of town?
COLETTE: Trust me. We're safe. Please keep playing. That's nice. What is it?
DANNY: Miles Davis. "All Blues."
COLETTE: Never heard of him.
DANNY: Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
COLETTE: Like you?
DANNY: Nah. I'm strictly minor league. except for the fucked-up part.
DANNY: Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
COLETTE: And you admire that?
DANNY: It's the only way to play.
COLETTE: Is that how you play?
DANNY: I try.
COLETTE: No false notes?
COLETTE: No deep dark secrets?
DANNY: ( cold and abrupt ): What are you up to?
COLETTE: What do you want from me, Colette?
DANNY: What do you want from me, Colette?
COLETTE: I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
DANNY: It gets me through the day.
COLETTE: You really need to lighten up. Just relax.
DANNY: Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
COLETTE: This has nothing to do with him.
DANNY: So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
COLETTE: Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
DANNY: How much time do you have?
COLETTE: What is wrong with you?
DANNY: How much time do you have?
COLETTE: You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
DANNY: Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
COLETTE: There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
DANNY: You don't like the tune, find another What are you hiding, Danny?
COLETTE: What are you hiding, Danny?
DANNY: Therapy session is over.
COLETTE: You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
DANNY: No. But I'm the only one with my sad And that's how it's gonna stay.
DANNY: Excuse me?
GARCETTI: Several possession charges, but nothing major.
DANNY: Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
GARCETTI: They have. But they never found a lab.
TANNER: That's because he doesn't have one.
DANNY: Whata you mean? He told me -
TANNER: Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers. As least that's what the word is.
DANNY: What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
TANNER: That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
GARCETTI: You're lucky, Flynne.
DANNY: Funny, I don't feel lucky.
GARCETTI: We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
DANNY: What if he caps me before you can make a move?
TANNER: Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
GARCETTI: Don't we always take good care of you?
DANNY: Speaking of which . you run that license plate for me?
GARCETTI: You mean the menacing red car?
DANNY: What? Is it bad?
TANNER: I'm afraid so, Danny.
DANNY: Who is it?
GARCETTI: Brace yourself.
DANNY: Come on! Who is it? Domingo's boys?
GARCETTI: Worse. Much worse. A teacher.
TANNER: Car is registered to a Mrs. Nancy Plummer.
GARCETTI: She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
TANNER: Now that's scary!
GARCETTI: You're paranoid, Flynne. I think that crank is finally starting to get the best of you.
JIMMY: You sure you don't want me to go with you?
DANNY: Pooh-Bear, my man. What's up?
LITTLE BILL: He's blue.
BIG BILL: Comin' down from a 10 day ride.
DANNY: You want to do this some other time?
DANNY: I'm sorry?
DANNY: ( laughing nervously ) Come on, guys .
BIG BILL: Argh, matie. I'm a pirate.
DANNY: ( trying to stay calm ) Pooh-Bear. come on, man. What is ( off Pooh-Bear's silence ) It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
DANNY: Pooh-Bear holds up his hand.
DANNY: Please .. I don't know what you're .
DANNY: Jesus Christ. Um . I'm not .. Captain Steubing. I'm not working for the cops.
BIG BILL: Drop your package in the cage.
DANNY: My what?
BIG BILL: Put your pee-pee through the hole.
DANNY: This is fucking crazy!
BIG BILL: Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
DANNY: Oh fuck . oh Jesus .
DANNY: Okay! Okay! Oh my God . oh-my-fucking-God .
DANNY: I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God! You got something to tell Captain Steubing, you'd better do it now.
DANNY: ( rapid-fire ) Captain Steubing, listen to me. You're after the wrong guy. This is the fuck you should be talking to. Jimmy told me that Little Bill's been shorting Pooh-Bear . settin' up his own stuff on the side.
LITTLE BILL: That's a pack of discharge.
DANNY: It's true. Jimmy saw him flashing a pimp role at a bar the other night . said he was dissin' your ass in front of one of your customers.
LITTLE BILL: Damn straight.
DANNY: Can I pull my dick out now?
LITTLE BILL: ( holding up his arms ) Go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
DANNY: Can I pull my dick out?
BIG BILL: He's clean.
LITTLE BILL: He follows their gaze to the cash.
DANNY: CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
DANNY: I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
DANNY: What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
DANNY: Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
TANNER: We're in business.
GARCETTI: Good work, Flynne. You're a first-rate rat.
DANNY: That's real sweet, Garcetti. Thanks.
TANNER: We got the 411 on your good old boy. Nothing local so we ran his prints through the F.B.I. Believed to be a major supplier in Texas. Jumped bail on a murder rap last April.
DANNY: Murder. Beautiful.
TANNER: Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
DANNY: You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
GARCETTI: Didn't you hear? Domingo's dead.
TANNER: Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
DANNY: I thought you'd be happy.
TANNER: I thought you'd be happy.
DANNY: He doesn't look happy.
NANCY: Who is it?
DANNY: All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
NANCY: Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you. Billy's a cop now, you know.
VERNE: Highway Patrol.
NANCY: He said you were . the people you Were with . well .
VERNE: Said you were a drug addict.
DANNY: Maybe I should just go.
NANCY: No. We want to help you, Tom. I know everyone deals with grief in their own way. I know how hard it is to find closure.
DANNY: Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
NANCY: I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
DANNY: Is that what you want me to do? Put it all on Jesus? Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
NANCY: You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep Maybe I am dealing with it.
DANNY: Maybe I am dealing with it.
NANCY: I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but .
DANNY: Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
VERNE: That was my idea.
DANNY: You never did like me much, did you And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you? I don't blame you for hating me. At least I understand that. But forgiving the butchers who killed Liz well I'm having some trouble with that one.
NANCY: Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, a persecute
DANNY: I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz. No one can. And you can't forgive for me.
NANCY: Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
DANNY: I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred. Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her. Do you know what that feels like?
NANCY: It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
DANNY: Verne slams his hand down on the table.
VERNE: By not disgracing her memory!
DANNY: What does that mean?
VERNE: You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose. Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter? You ever think you might be buying drugs from the very people who took her life?
DANNY: You don't understand.
VERNE: Understand what?
DANNY: Nothing. It's . it's complicated. I just want you to know . I'm not what you think I am.
DANNY: Who is it?
DANNY: I'm kind of busy.
DANNY: Oh Jesus. Colette . You've gotta leave.
COLETTE: We been through that.
DANNY: What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
COLETTE: I need my paycheck.
DANNY: You can still work.
COLETTE: He knows where I work.
DANNY: Find a new job.
COLETTE: It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
DANNY: You always been this stubborn?
COLETTE: From day one. I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
DANNY: Ass first into the world.
COLETTE: I been that way ever since. Look at us. What a pair.
COLETTE: Can we try that again?
DANNY: I can't. I can't.
COLETTE: Why not?
DANNY: I just can't. Okay?
COLETTE: What's wrong, Danny?
DANNY: Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
COLETTE: No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
DANNY: I can't tell you.
COLETTE: There's someone else, isn't there?
DANNY: Colette waits a beat, then turns to leave. Something about Danny's voice - a raw vulnerability - which we haven't seen in him before. MOVE OFF of Danny and ONTO THE FLASHBACK IMAGE.
BO: What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the That's it?
BO: Are you Australian?
BO: Good. I fucking hate Australians.
BO: Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty. Just kinda' filthy is all.
BO: No, I don't mind. That's how come I told you about it.
LIZ: Try to make it fast. So. What do you do for a living around here?
BO: You know. This and that.
BO: Skeeters. They're bad up here.
INTRUDER ONE: INTRUDER TWO emerges from the back carrying a small nylon bag. They start to head out the front door when . . one of the curtain rings breaks with a METALLIC "TING". ON DANNY - freaking. His eyes shooting back to Liz.
DANNY: She died knowing that I was a coward. that I didn't lift a finger to help her.
COLLETTE: There was nothing you could have done.
DANNY: No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done They would have killed you too.
COLETTE: They would have killed you too.
DANNY: ( finally looks her in the eye ) Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
DANNY: ( looking up ) Colette.I want to help you, with Quincey.
COLETTE: No Danny, Don't- But you gotta be serious about it.
COLETTE: Really, I don't want to.
DANNY: I want to do this for you. I want to do something good for a change. I want you to hide this somewhere where Quincy won't find it.
COLETTE: What is it?
DANNY: Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
COLETTE: I don't want to.
DANNY: I'm offering you the chance to take care of your problems. Take it. Don't make the same mistake I did, Colette. Do something while you have a chance. Do it for your daughter before something happens. Believe me, you don't want to live with this burden. He helds the baggie out again. Colette reluctantly takes it from him. Tommorrow night, when he is asleep. I want you to beep me at this number. He writes the number down on a dollar bill.
DANNY: Will you do that? Then I want you to get out of the room.
COLETTE: Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
DANNY: Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
DANNY: Just do it. All your problems with Quincey will be taken care of.
JIMMY: What's this?
DANNY: Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare. It's for you.
JIMMY: But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
DANNY: You aren't coming with me. I need you to do me a favor instead.
JIMMY: Wait till I tell you what it is.
DANNY: Wait till I tell you what it is.
JIMMY: It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
DANNY: You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
JIMMY: You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
DANNY: Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
JIMMY: Hey, check it out.
DANNY: What the hell is that?
JIMMY: ( Proudly ) It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh? I really have to tell you something. It's important.
JIMMY: I'm not a tweaker. I don't use drugs. I never had. I'm not joking. But.I've seen you.
DANNY: I'm not a tweaker. I don't use drugs. I never had. I'm not joking. But.I've seen you.
JIMMY: But.I've seen you.
DANNY: When? When did you ever see me use?
JIMMY: This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
DANNY: You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one? You asked me how I always keep my shit together. Well, that's how.
JIMMY: No one ever noticed?
DANNY: Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
JIMMY: But. why? Why would you pretend?
DANNY: I can't tell you.
JIMMY: You don't trust me?
DANNY: I don't trust anybody.
JIMMY: And you want me to do you some big favor? It's cool. I understand Danny gets up to leave.
JIMMY: ( beat ) If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
DANNY: Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers. I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
DANNY: You mad at me, Jimmy?
JIMMY: I don't know. a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the I'm sorry. I couldn't.
DANNY: I'm sorry. I couldn't.
DANNY: You know you can get that tattoo removed, don't you.
JIMMY: Nah. I want to keep it. Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration .you know.like when I detox?
DANNY: Good for you Jimmy.
DANNY: I really want you to take this.
JIMMY: Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
DANNY: You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
BUBBA: CONVERSATION WILL INTERCUT BETWEEN TWO LOCATIONS
DANNY: Everything go?
BUBBA: Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
DANNY: Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
BUBBA: I ain't a idiot, asshole.
DANNY: I'll see you tonight.
TANNER: Man of few words.
GARCETTI: With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
DANNY: With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
GARCETTI: Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
TANNER: Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
HISPANIC GUY: As Danny approaches the truck, the door slides open. He piles in.
DANNY: You tell me.
BUBBA: You ready to go meet the team?
TRAHN: For those of you who don't know this is Tom Van Allen. a.k.a. Danny About a year and half ago, Mr. Van Allen's wife was murdered at a meth lab out near the Salton Sea. No one was ever apprehended for the crime but local authorities have always assumed it was a hit and grab perpetrated by rival drug dealers. That is, until Tom here took it upon himself to conduct a one-man undercover operation at great risk to his own personal safety.
AGENT ONE: He's a civilian? How the hell did you pull this off?
DANNY: I played the long shot. Just got lucky.
BOOKMAN: How about the car? The model? Was it a truck? S.U.V.? Sedan?
DANNY: All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
BOOKMAN: Not even a guess?
DANNY: ( pissed off0 How many times do we have to go through You said one of the perpetrators crossed in front of the headlights .
DANNY: Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
BOOKMAN: How about in the house?
DANNY: They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
BOOKMAN: Did you see his hair color?
DANNY: No, Why?
BOOKMAN: Forensics found this on your wife.
BOOKMAN: What is it?
DANNY: Nothing, I'm trying to remember. I'm sorry. I didn't see his hair color. I'm sure of it.
AGENT ONE: Why didn't you tell him?
DANNY: Because I wanted to find them myself I wanted to kill them.
DANNY: I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
TRAHN: That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
DANNY: These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
TANNER: ( the line takes on a whole new meaning ) This could be the one we're looking for.
AGENT TWO: How sure are you that you're not chasing two good cops? I mean all you've really got is one red hair. That's still your only evidence.
TRAHN: Not anymore. We tapped these guys' phones and computers at Gardena P.D. Tanner and Garcetti didn't report on this deal. Not a peep. They haven't coordinated with Palmdale P.D. They're keeping it off the books. It looks like we've got the right guys. We'll find out for sure tonight.
TRAHN: How you holding up?
DANNY: I'm fine. Little nervous.little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
TRAHN: Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
DANNY: Oh shit
TRAHN: Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help. Could you call Gardena P.D. tell 'em you got a tip that the guy's holding? Maybe have 'em send out a patrol car?
DANNY: Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help. Could you call Gardena P.D. tell 'em you got a tip that the guy's holding? Maybe have 'em send out a patrol car?
TRAHN: I'll see what I can do.
DANNY: Hey guys.
AGENT ONE: ( into min-mike ) All right people, heads up. Blue team?
MAID ONE: I've got a visual.
AGENT ONE: ( filtered ) Red team?
WORKMAN ONE: He's heading to his room.
AGENT ONE: ( filtered ) Black team?
AGENT ONE: Okay. It's all yours.
GARCETTI: Half an hour to kickoff.
TRAHN: You alone? Any word from Pooh-Bear? You okay, hoss?
JIMMY: Danny told me to tell you that he was sorry. He said he had to take care of this himself.
TANNER: Here he comes.
DANNY: Easy, boy.
TANNER: Where's Bubba?
GARCETTI: Maybe he isn't showing. Looks like Flynne's handling the cash. Let's get into position.
TANNER: Looks like Flynne's handling the cash. Let's get into position.
DANNY: What the hell is this?
DANNY: This is bullshit. You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
DANNY: Come on, man, let's deal.
DANNY: Yeah, dickhead.
DANNY: Anybody there?
DANNY: I'm here, Liz. I'm here.
GARCETTI: Get the bag. Let's get out of here.
TANNER: My name is Tom. Tom Van Allen
DANNY: My name is Tom. Tom Van Allen
TANNER: Whatever you say, man. Look . can we talk about this?
DANNY: Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully . You're in the bathroom. You've been shot in the shoulder . . there's two guys with masks and guns in the other room about to kill your wife. But you know if you go out there, they'll kill you, too. You'll both die. What do you do? Do you go out there and die like a man or do you live to fight another day? What do you do? Answer the question! What do you do!
TANNER: Please . don't do this .
DANNY: Answer the fucking question!
TANNER: Does that answer your question? I fight. I fight and I die like a man. You're a fucking coward, Flynne. You lived like one and now you're gonna die like one.
DANNY: ( mumbling ) Glock semi-automatic 9 mm .
KID: Tenifer matte finish, Polymer grip, fixed sights, 4 and 1/2 inch barrel, 22 ounces, double action and a .
KID: . and a TEN ROUND magazine .
DANNY: It doesn't matter.
TANNER: Too late to be a hero.
DANNY: Ten it is.
DANNY: ( softly ) You're dead.
DANNY: My name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a trumpet player.
QUINCEY: You're a motherfucking rat.
COLETTE: You said you wouldn't kill him!
COLETTE: You lied to me!
QUINCEY: Oops. My bad. Colette, what happened? Didn't the cops .
DANNY: Colette, what happened? Didn't the cops .
QUINCEY: The cops came. But they didn't find nothing. Turns out their C.I. game 'em some bad information. You fuck with the Mexicali Boys, this is what you get, homes. Domingo thought you might be the one who went rat on him. So I brought in a rat of my own.
DANNY: You set me up?
QUINCEY: Bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo.
DANNY: You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
COLETTE: Danny, it's not what you think.
COLETTE: I owed them money . a lot of money . they didn't give me a choice. You know how it works. When I got to know you, I tried to back out . that's when they did this . But I told them I wouldn't do it .. I didn't want to see you get hurt. She selling me a bill, home boy?
DANNY: She selling me a bill, home boy?
QUINCEY: Nah, she ain't lying. She took a pretty good beating from you, ace. I seen grown men crack after a lot less. But not this bitch. It was very touching.
DANNY: Then why are we here?
COLETTE: They threatened to kill my daughter. I had no choice. I'm sorry, Danny. It's okay. It's okay. God damn, you're beautiful.
DANNY: It's okay. It's okay. God damn, you're beautiful.
QUINCEY: Quincey grabs her arm.
COLETTE: The drapes go up in flames. Quincey puts the gun to the back of her
QUINCEY: You wanna die here with him or come with me?
DANNY: Colette, go.
COLETTE: I don't want to leave you.
DANNY: Your daughter needs you. Go.
BLACK SCREEN: THEN BLURRY, VAGUE SLOW MOTION - moving through the flames. CLOSE ON DANNY'S HEAD - seemingly floating through the fiery room.
TATTO: ( warped, distorted ) Hang in there buddy. Oh no. What a fucking cliché.
