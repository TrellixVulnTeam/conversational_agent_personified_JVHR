NET CORRESPONDENT: NET CORRESPONDENT We 've just landes here on whar cap troopres are calling "Big K" with the 6th Mobile Infantery division. It 's an ugly planet, a bug planet, a planet hostile to life as we iGKKKKKK ! Blood hits the lens as the Correspondent is cut in half. The CAMERA catches a glimpse of HUGE CLAWS as Cap Trooper JOHNNY RICO , 18, blows away SOMETHING BIG big with his pulse cannon.
NET CORRESPONDENT: We 've just landes here on whar cap troopres are calling "Big K" with the 6th Mobile Infantery division. It 's an ugly planet, a bug planet, a planet hostile to life as we iGKKKKKK ! Blood hits the lens as the Correspondent is cut in half. The CAMERA catches a glimpse of HUGE CLAWS as Cap Trooper JOHNNY RICO , 18, blows away SOMETHING BIG big with his pulse cannon.
JOHNNY: Com'on, let's go ! ON THE BOUNCE The cap troopers move out, among them DIZZY FLORES, 18, ACE LEVY, 19, and KITTEN SMITH, 18. The CAMERA pauses, unsure.
JOHNNY: THIS WAY ! The group splits into two, and the CAMERA follows Johnny. Something slices Kitten Smith, and he goes down screaming.
JOHNNY: KITTEN ! Johnny stops to help his comrade. A CLAW slashes into him.
KITTEN !: Johnny stops to help his comrade. A CLAW slashes into him.
JOHNNY: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Now something grabs the CAMERA, spinning it around. We glimpse the hideous jaws of an ARACHNID WARRIOR.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !: Now something grabs the CAMERA, spinning it around. We glimpse the hideous jaws of an ARACHNID WARRIOR.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !: The CAMERA hits the ground. Johnny, badly wounded, bleeding from the mouth, crawls into CAMERA, trying to get away from the dark INSECT SHAPES that close in on him.
JOHNNY: Oh, God. Oh, God, help me. please help me. His eyes glaze over as he remembers
JOHNNY: Sorry, Mr. Rasczak. But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class, Johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desk's touch screen.
RASCZAK: Here in History and Moral Philosophy we've explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos, and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since. You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You. Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? Rasczak points at LANNY, 17, with his stump
LANNY: It's a reward. what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service. Rasczak is crestfallen, makes a big show of patience.
RASCZAK: No. Something given has no value ! Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ? I guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential. Laughter. Johnny's cartoon, meanwhile, is taking shape: Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship.
RASCZAK: When you vote, you're exercising political authority. You're using force. And force, my friends, is violence, the supreme authority from which all other authority derives. CARL JENKINS, 18, a superintelligent geek, jumps in.
CARL: Gee, we always thought you were the supreme authority, Mr. Rasczak. Laughter. Rasczak grins.
RASCZAK: In my classroom, you bet. Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion, political authority is violence by degree. The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it. DIZZY FLORES, 18, athletic, pretty, no nonsense, chimes in.
DIZZY: My mother always says that violence never solves anything.
RASCZAK: Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that. Rasczak points at Carmen.
CARMEN: They probably wouldn't say anything. Hiroshima was destroyed. Johnny presses Â´"SEND" on his desk, and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen.
RASCZAK: Correct. Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor. The contrary opinion 'violence never solves anything' is wishful thinking at its worst. While Rasczak looks away, Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile, and Johnny's gone, checked out, flying round Venus.
RASCZAK: People who forget that always pay. They pay with their lives and their Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face. So does Rasczak. He points at him with his stump, snaps Johnny to.
RASCZAK: You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
JOHNNY: The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
RASCZAK: The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
JOHNNY: Uh, I don't know.
RASCZAK: Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass. A bell rings. Rasczak shrugs, indifferent.
RASCZAK: Well, that's it. Have a nice life.
CARMEN: C'mon, let's see if they've posted the math final test yet.
STUDENT: Hey, Rico, we gonna take Tesla ?
JOHNNY: How should I know ?
STUDENT: You're captain of the team !
CARMEN: First thing Fleet Academy looks at is your math scores. Wish me luck ! Carmen enters her name, receives her score: 97% ! She beams.
JOHNNY: Good for you.
CARMEN: Your turn. Then she spots Carl across the way talking with MARCO, 17.
CARMEN: Hold on. I wanna talk to Marco. His sister's at Fleet ! Carmen rushes off. Johnny checks his score: 35% ! Crushed, he makes sure no none else has seen. Carl walks up to him.
CARL: You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
JOHNNY: What's the hurry ?
CARL: Others are waiting. Carl points out Dizzy, talking with friends.
JOHNNY: Did you read her mind ?
CARL: Don't have to. Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss. It's true. You can tell by the way she looks at Johnny.
JOHNNY: Yeah, but I want Carmen.
CARL: You got it bad. Carmen returns to Johnny as Carls heads off.
CARL: Don't forget about this afternoon. He's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss. Carmen blushes, covers.
CARMEN: She's flying starships !
JOHNNY: Who ?
CARMEN: Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes. You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
JOHNNY: I have good reflexes. Carmen notices the way Dizzy's looking at Johnny, doesn't like it one bit, takes Johnny's arm.
CARMEN: C'mon Johnny, we'll be late for Biology.
BIOLOGY TEACHER: For our final today, please identify the mouthparts, the abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the nerve cord and count the ganglia. You may begin. The students remove the cover to reveal large alien bugs, 60 centimeter ARKELLIAN SAND BEETLES laid out for dissection.
CARMEN: Eeuch !
JOHNNY: Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
BIOLOGY TEACHER: Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are Nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many ways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of Better put your goggles on. Johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser. Green fluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill.
JOHNNY: Better put your goggles on. Johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser. Green fluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill.
BIOLOGY TEACHER: Our galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have identified over two billion species so far. Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly.
CARMEN: But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented art, mathematics and interstellar travel.
BIOLOGY TEACHER: True, we know of no insect society that has produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your head, take the example of the Arachnids, a highly organized, highly evolved insect society. She points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a common ant and ends with a two meter tall ARACHNID WARRIOR.
BIOLOGY TEACHER: They are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the biological means to hurl their spore into space. Johnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity open with aresounding crack. Bug guts gush out.
JOHNNY: Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric Excuse me.! She heads for the door, hand over her mouth.
CARMEN: Excuse me.! She heads for the door, hand over her mouth.
JOHNNY: 35% on the math final ! No one could be that dumb with numbers.
CARMEN: Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
JOHNNY: Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
CARMEN: Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
JOHNNY: Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
CARMEN: I don't want everyone to see.
JOHNNY: Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
CARMEN: How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
JOHNNY: It's all I think about anymore. Indeed, they are all alone now. The look in Johnny's eye says how about it. Carmen grins, reaches for Johnny's hand.
CARMEN: You can't walk me home.
JOHNNY: Why not ?
CARMEN: I thought you were going to help Carl.
JOHNNY: Carl can wait.
CARMEN: Johnny, my Dad's home today. Johnny's face darkens with frustration.
JOHNNY: What's he got against me. I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
CARMEN: It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
JOHNNY: Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
CARMEN: Sometimes I do what I want, eh ? Carmen steps into the flux. ZAPPP! She's gone. Johnny grins, happy to be in love.
CARL: Don't think about it. go on instinct.
JOHNNY: Ace of spades. The ace of spades appears, and the computer indicates "no match". Carl puts another card up, the jack of diamonds.
CARL: Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
JOHNNY: In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts. Wrong again.
CARL: Luck is not a factor. No one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren't. Federal studies like this might provide a clue. The next card up is the nine of clubs.
JOHNNY: I wouldn't want to know what everyone was thinking. Four of spades. Suddenly, A GIANT YELLOW FROG jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing the monitor. Johnny removes the blindfold.
CARL: Cyrano, you big yellow turd ! Johnny knows this frog, scratches him on the neck.
JOHNNY: He just wants attention. You don't play with him like you used to. Carl concentrates for a moment.
CARL: Go bug Mom, Cyrano. Cyrano's eyes widen. He hops off the table and up the stairs two at a time. Carl clears the screen.
JOHNNY: How do you make him do that ?
CARL: I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it. From upstairs, CARL'S MOM shrieks.
JOHNNY: Carl, promise me you won't ever do anything like that to me.
CARL: Don't be afraid. Can't do humans. yet. C'mon let's go. Carl, puts up more cards, Johnny misses them all.
JOHNNY: Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
CARL: Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
JOHNNY: I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
CARL: Your father will never let you.
JOHNNY: I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
CARL: Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
JOHNNY: Eight point. no, uh, seven.
CARL: If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
JOHNNY: All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
CARL: Love. how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention. Carl puts a card up.
JOHNNY: Queen of hearts. The computer indicates a match. Johnny peers around at the monitor. It is the Queen of hearts.
CARL: Well, what do you know about that !
DIZZY: Tesla's tough. They tumble good and they hit HARD. Dizzy bounces a JUMP SHOE to Johnny. The spring fires and vaults it high into the air. Johnny catches it, puts it on, smiles cocky at the TESLA GIANTS who suit up in red and gold.
JOHNNY: We tumble good, too.
DIZZY: Kick three, fade left. On two. They make fists, then breal for thevline of scrimmage.
ZANDER: Time's running out. Zander points. The SCOREBOARD shows TIGERS 19, GIANTS 20, three minutes and counting on the clock. Johnny grins.
JOHNNY: A lot can happen in three minutes.
DIZZY: Hut. hut ! Johnny takes the handoff, flips over a gauntlet of Giant guards. Zander hurls himself at Johnny, misses. Johnny scores. Zander tumbles into the crowd, loses a jump shoe.
CARMEN: Are you alright ?
ZANDER: I'm getting better.
ZANDER: So what are you doing later ?
CARMEN: Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
ZANDER: I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow. Zander heads for the field. Carmen follows, interested.
CARMEN: You're going to the Academy ? That's where I want to go. I'd love to talk to you abou that. A REFEREE blows his whistle at Zander, signalling impatiently.
ZANDER: I'm all ears.
CARMEN: Don't you have to finish the game ?
JOHNNY: Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
ZANDER: You can never be sure. Johnny scowls at Zander, turns his head to look back at Carmen. She waves, smiling. The Giants pull ablitz.
DIZZY: WATCH THE BLITZ.! Zander knocks Johnny on his ass, and the Giants score. It's TIGERS 21, GIANTS 22 and less than a minute to go.
DIZZY: Flip six, three hole. Rico ? Hey ! Dizzy slams Johnny upside his helmet with her forearm.
JOHNNY: What ?
DIZZY: You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
JOHNNY: Just throw me the ball, Diz. They make fists and break.
DIZZY: Hut ! At the snap, Johnny breaks for open field. Dizzy throws, Johnny catches it, trips Zander up painfully, and hurls himself into the end zone as a horn sounds the game's finish.
MOTHER: Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face.
JOHNNY: Aw, don't get mushy. Johnny's FATHER enters carrying a FEDERAL SERVICE CATALOGUE.
FATHER: This came for you today. I presume on your A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service.
JOHNNY: A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service.
MOTHER: You aren't thinking of applying.? Johnny shrugs.
FATHER: Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
JOHNNY: It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
MOTHER: Johnny, people get hurt. people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do.
FATHER: Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I Mr. Rasczak.
JOHNNY: Mr. Rasczak.
FATHER: Rasczak. Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
JOHNNY: No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
FATHER: Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
JOHNNY: I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
FATHER: Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
MOTHER: Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
JOHNNY: Uh, no.
FATHER: A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
JOHNNY: Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
MOTHER: Good good, then it's all settled.
FATHER: A year at Harvard and you'll see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
JOHNNY: Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
FATHER: Sorry. Carl's a fine boy. Johnny puts on his jacket.
JOHNNY: I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
MOTHER: Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
JOHNNY: Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now ! Johnny stomps out, the transporter goes ZAPPP !
MOTHER: Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
FATHER: Teenagers !
BAND LEADER: Alright, everybody, this is the last dance, so let's turn down the lights and make it a slow one. The lights go down. Dizzy, dressed pretty, brightens when she sees Johnny standing alone near the dance floor.
DIZZY: Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
JOHNNY: Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen.
DIZZY: Too bad for her if she's not around. Dizzy pulls him onto the floor, holds him close.
DIZZY: You know, it's sad. Most of us probably won't see each other again after tonight.
JOHNNY: You still gonna play for Brazil ?
DIZZY: Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
JOHNNY: Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
DIZZY: How come we never got together ? Dizzy looks at Johnny meaningfully. He's distracted. Carmen crosses the room, stunning in her formal.
JOHNNY: Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
DIZZY: Uh, look, Diz.
JOHNNY: Uh, look, Diz.
DIZZY: Guess you gotta go.
JOHNNY: You're the best. Johnny heads for Carmen. Dizzy watches jealously as Carmen takes his hand. She looks around for someone to dance with. Carl, a nerd in a tux, waves shyly.
JOHNNY: Isn't it great to be in love ?
CARMEN: How do I know if this is love ?
JOHNNY: It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't.
CARL: Outa the way you two ! Carl and Dizzy dance by, Dizzy smiling bravely because Carl is a terrible dancer. Johnny goes in for the kiss again.
CARMEN: Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation.
JOHNNY: Aw, you're in love with me. You just dont know it yet. Johnny's confidence makes her smile. Johnny moves in to kiss her, but the music ends. Everyone applauds. The lights come up and people head for the doors. Johnny sees Rasczak.
JOHNNY: Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
CARMEN: I'll meet you outside. Johnny heads over to Rasczak.
JOHNNY: Mister Rasczak ?
RASCZAK: What is it, Rico ?
JOHNNY: I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
RASCZAK: ( smiling ) Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
JOHNNY: I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
RASCZAK: Good for you. Go find out.
JOHNNY: Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was What would you do if you were me ?
RASCZAK: Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
CARMEN: Johnny, this is Zander.
ZANDER: Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
JOHNNY: None at all. We won.
CARMEN: Good luck at the academy. Zander takes back the wings and pins the to his tunic.
ZANDER: 30 EXT PROMENADE - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN
CARMEN: He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
JOHNNY: Yeah, sure, I guess.
CARMEN: No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
JOHNNY: What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
CARMEN: Zander is going for pilot, too.
JOHNNY: You two have so much in common. Carmen pulls Johnny to a stop, looks him in the eye.
CARMEN: Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
JOHNNY: I can't help it.
CARMEN: He's nothing like you.
JOHNNY: I don't even know if you're my girl. Carmen smiles, leans in close to Johnny.
CARMEN: Are you the boy for me ?
JOHNNY: I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service. They kiss, tentatively, but the passion grows and they break apart, Oh, Johnny.
CARMEN: Oh, Johnny.
CARMEN: Everyone's looking. we shouldn't.
JOHNNY: Who cares ?
CARMEN: You're right. Let's never stop.
POLICEMAN: Hey, you, there's a place for that ! Without stopping, Johnny pulls Carmen into the flux. ZAPPP !
JOHNNY: I love you, Carmen.
CARMEN: She puts her mouth on his and they melt together. The door flies open, and CARMEN'S DAD stands there.
CARMEN'S DAD: Carmen, it's late. Get inside.
CARMEN: Sorry, Dad. See you, Johnny. Carmen ducks inside. Her father looks Johnny over. He carries a terrible battle scar oon his face.
CARMEN'S DAD: I don't want you around Carmen anymore. Get me ?
JOHNNY: Maybe Carmen's gonna make her own decisions from now on, Mr. Ibanez. Carmen's Dad reddens. He'd like to punch Johnny out.
CARMEN'S DAD: Carmen's gonna be a citizen. She don't need you and your rich family. The Federation'll give her everything she needs.
RECRUITING SERGEANT: Fresh meat for the grinder, eh ?
CARL: That's us. Where do we sign ? He turns in his chair to grab the forms. Johnny and his friends see that he is also missing both legs. The Recruiting Sergeant catches them looking, smiles even wider.
RECRUITING SERGEANT: Here and here and here. As he signs, Johnny looks at the campaign ribbons on the Recruiting Sergeant's chest. We hear MUSIC: "The Mobile Infantery Anthem" plays softly in honor of distant battles.
RECRUITING SERGEANT: Welcome to the adventure of Federal Service. Follow the blue line.
COLONEL: There is no guarantee of service. We don't need all of you. It costs a great deal to train human beings for useful tasks. Many jobs are hazardous to your health. If you are chosen and do not wish to serve you may resign at anytime simply by completing form 1240/A. Thank you for exercising you constitutonal rights.
DON: They took my sister, they'll take anybody.
DON: Oh, this is the part that hurts ! A PSYCH OFFICER sits down across from each candidate.
PSYCH OFFICER: No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
JOHNNY: Here in Buenos Aires. The Psych Officer checks Johnny's response on a meter.
MAJOR: I'm happy to tell you that you've been accepted for Federal Service.
JOHNNY: Wow, that's great.
MAJOR: Looks like you're quite an athlete. Boy, look at those reaction stats. The Major clucks his tongue as he highlights the last category on his list:
MAJOR: My job is to dertermine what you're best suited for.
JOHNNY: I want to be a pilot, sir.
MAJOR: Sorry, son, no way. Your school records say you don't have the math skills. Johnny swallows this. He knew it was coming. The Major deletes "Pilot" from the list, then several other items.
MAJOR: That rules out the scientific and engineering applications, and I'm afraid we reserve non-military options for candidates who are frankly less able-bodied than you are, son. He turns the monitor around and shows Johnny the list. The only thing left is MOBILE INFANTERY.
MAJOR: It looks like the only thing you're good for is cannon fodder. I'm putting you down for the Mobile Infantery.
CARMEN: I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose.?
JOHNNY: Naw, I made it, Carl made it. Just then, Don rushes past, shamefaced, crying.
JOHNNY: He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't.
CARMEN: Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse. The Recruiting Sergeant is getting ready to go home. He's got legs now, and he takes a prosthetic arm from its case and snaps it on. He grins when he sees them staring.
RECRUITING SERGEANT: They put me out front to discourage the weak-hearted, but at the end of the day I go home. How'd you kids do ?
CARMEN: I'm gonna go for pilot.
RECRUITING SERGEANT: Good for you. We need every pilot we can get. Johnny holds the door for Carmen and the Recruiting Sergeant. Suddenly Carl appears looking a little paler than usual.
CARMEN: Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
JOHNNY: Did you get Starside R
CARL: 42 EXT FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN
JOHNNY: I don't believe it !
CARL: I got Games Well, everyone's a little impressed by this.
CARMEN: Intelligence. Oh, Carl !
JOHNNY: Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
RECRUITING SERGEANT: Next time we meet, I'll probably have to salute you. What about you, son ?
JOHNNY: Infantery, sir. The Recruiting Sergeant beams, offers a prosthetic hand.
RECRUITING SERGEANT: Well, good for you. The Mobile Infantery made me the man I am today. Just what Johnny wanted to hear. They watch the old Sergeant walk away. MUSIC: "The Mobile Infantery Theme". Carmen takes Johnny and Carl by the arm as they walk.
CARMEN: Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
JOHNNY: I'll go for that.
CARL: Well, we're gonna be millions of light years away from each other, and chances are we'll never see each other again, but sure.
CARMEN: I can't wait to tell my Dad I'm in. He's gonna be so happy !
JOHNNY: My father's probably gonna kill me.
FATHER: You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer.
JOHNNY: I won't quit !
FATHER: I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
JOHNNY: I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it. Johnny turns for the door. His father throws his last shot.
FATHER: You walk out that door, you're cut off, young man. You understand me ? Alright, THAT'S IT, YOU'RE.
MOTHER: Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
JOHNNY: Well, yeah, sure.
MOTHER: I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform. Johnny's face reddens.
JOHNNY: Don't talk about my girl that way. Johnny turns on his heel, heads for the transporter. ZAPPP !
JOHNNY: You're late.
CARMEN: My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go. At the freight station, Carmen enters her Federal I.D. card and gets numbered tags for her bags.
JOHNNY: Me, too. I'm wearing everything I own. Johnny loads them onto a conveyor belt.
CARMEN: Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
JOHNNY: Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
CARMEN: You talk to Carl ?
JOHNNY: He left this morning. He couldn't say where. Carmen logs in, enters her destination: LUNA - TERESHKOVA FLEET ACADEMY. The tickets station spits out a pass.
CARMEN: It's exciting, but it's scary, too isn't it. Going someplace new where you don't know anyone. Carmen heads toward a bank of transporters. Johnny stops her, takes her by the arms.
JOHNNY: I'm gonna miss you.
CARMEN: I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
JOHNNY: I love you.
CARMEN: Oh, that's me.
JOHNNY: Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
CARMEN: Alright, I love you. Carmen kisses him, jumps into the transporter.
JOHNNY: Do you mean it ?
CARMEN: I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write ! ZAPPP ! The last thing he sees are her beautiful eyes.
OFFICIAL VOICE: From all over the known Galaxy, prospectice citizens work together to make a better tomorrow ! Would you like to know more ?
OFFICIAL VOICE: A murderer was captured and tried today. Sentence: DEATH. Tonight at six, all net, all channels. Would you like to know more ?
OFFICIAL VOICE: If you think you are psychic, maybe you are. Harness your unique abilities and take advantage of the many Federal benefits available for psychic citizens. Would you like to know more ?
OFFICIAL VOICE: Disregarding Federal warnings, Mormon extremists established Port Joe Smith, a settlement of 300 on Tango Urilla, a system just inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. Archival pictures of a captive two meter ARACHNID WARRIOR, multiple eyes, cutting mouthparts and claws. Wary SCIENTISTS keep their distance as it eats a COW.
OFFICIAL VOICE: Too late they realized tha Tango Urilla had already been chosen by other colonists Arachnids ! Now body parts litter the ruined streets of Port Joe Smith.
OFFICIAL VOICE: The council asks future colonists to obey all official Federal warnings. Would you like to know more ?
ZIM: The problem with you is that none of you are good enough the way you are. Johnny stands in formation with his squad, among them: BRECKINRIDGE, 18, DJANA'D, 19, KATRINA McINTIRE, 18, ACE LEVY, 18, SHUJUMI, 18, and KITTEN SMITH, 18.
ZIM: I am your senior drill instructor, Career Sergeant Zim.
ZIM: Do you think I'm funny ? Do I make you laugh ? Do you think I'm a comedian ? Kitten Smith shake his head "no" , but he can't stifle himself.
KITTEN SMITH: The first and last words out of your stinking holes will be "sir". Do you get me ?
ZIM: The first and last words out of your stinking holes will be "sir". Do you get me ?
KITTEN SMITH: Sir, sorry.sir.
ZIM: See the armory ? Run around it ! Kitten Smith squints. Out in the distance, a tiny building. Zim smacks him on the leg with his baton.
KITTEN SMITH: YEOW ! RUN, I SAID. Bronski, keep pace ! Kitten Smith runs. Big CORPORAL BRONSKI, 28, takes out after him, laying a baton across his backside every time he slows.
YEOW !: RUN, I SAID. Bronski, keep pace ! Kitten Smith runs. Big CORPORAL BRONSKI, 28, takes out after him, laying a baton across his backside every time he slows.
ZIM: RUN, I SAID. Bronski, keep pace ! Kitten Smith runs. Big CORPORAL BRONSKI, 28, takes out after him, laying a baton across his backside every time he slows.
ZIM: You are now all brothers and sisters in the same family, my family, the Mobile Infantery. I will be your mother. I will be your father. If you do not please me I will throw you out of my family because I hate all slackers and negative hackers. Do you get me ?
ZIM: Anytime you think I'm being to tough, anytime you think I'm being unfair. QUIT ! Grab your gear and take a stroll down "Washout Lane". Get me ?
ZIM: I wonder if there's a handful of guts in the whole bunch. Who thinks they've got what it takes to knock me down ? Breckinridge, a big guy from a farm planet, steps forward.
BRECKINRIDGE: Sir, I guess maybe I do, sir. Zim crooks afinger at him. Breckinridge charges. Zim knocks him flat. Breckinridge holds his arm, twisted now.
ZIM: You alright, Breckinridge ?
BRECKINRIDGE: Sir, yes, sir. It's my arm. I think it's broken, sir.
ZIM: MEDIC ! A MEDIC charges up, checks Breckinridge's arm, grins.
MEDIC !: A MEDIC charges up, checks Breckinridge's arm, grins.
MEDIC: Clean break. Doc'll have him back on active duty by tomorrow.
ZIM: Good. Who's next ? Shujumi steps up, assumes a fighting stance. Zim looks him over. There's not not much to him. Shujumi attacks Zim, counters his counter, dances out of range.
DJANA'D: Lookit the little guy go ! Now Zim attacks. Shujumi flip kicks Zim in the head.
JOHNNY: He's good alright.
KATRINA: I'll bet he makes squad leader.
ACE: He'll have to get past me. The recruits check Ace out. Zim sweeps Shujumi's legs, puts a knee in the little man's throat. Shujumi passes out.
ZIM: MEDIC ! 51 EXT OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY - THE RECRUITES tumble a brutal obstacle course using JUMP BOOTS.
MEDIC !: 51 EXT OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY - THE RECRUITES
ZIM: WHY IS THAT WEAPON ON THE GROUND ? YOUR WEAPON IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU ARE ! PICK IT UP ! PICK IT UP ! Zim begins to kick her because she doesn't move fast enough.
ZIM: Is that all you got ? You hit like kitten, Smith ! This is a punch. WHAM ! Zim knocks Kitten Smith for a loop.
ACE: Sir, I don't understands who needs a knife in a nuke fight anyway. All you gotta do is push a button, sir ! Zim yanks the knife out of the post.
ZIM: Put your hand on the post, private. Ace obeys. Zim throws, sticks his hand to the post.
ACE: AWK ! The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand. MEDIC ! Zim pays no attention to Ace who remains stuck to the post. A recruit trots up. Johnny stares, surprised. It's Dizzy.
AWK !: The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand. MEDIC ! Zim pays no attention to Ace who remains stuck to the post. A recruit trots up. Johnny stares, surprised. It's Dizzy.
ZIM: The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand. MEDIC ! Zim pays no attention to Ace who remains stuck to the post. A recruit trots up. Johnny stares, surprised. It's Dizzy.
DIZZY: Sir, recruit Flores, reporting for duty , sir. She snaps Zim a salute and hands him her orders.
ZIM: I see you specifically requested transfer from Fort Cronkite to this training group. Dizzy grins self-consciously at Johnny.
DIZZY: Sir, I heard it was the best, sir !
ZIM: It is the best. BUT WHAT MAKES YOU
ACE: I'd like to disable Zim.!
KATRINA: Improper Attitude ! They'll kick you out for talking like that.
DJANA'D: They can kick you out for anything. Improper Conduct, Unsatisfactory Off you go down Washout Lane, bye-bye ! Ace cuts into the front off the mess line.
KITTEN SMITH: Off you go down Washout Lane, bye-bye ! Ace cuts into the front off the mess line.
ACE: Aw, you either got what it takes or you don't.
DJANA'D: C'mon Ace, wait your turn !
ACE: At ease, soldier. It's all the same muck.
JOHNNY: Better get in line like everyone else, Ace. Silence. There could be a fight. Zim, standing nearby, watches with interest. Ace opens his hand.
ACE: You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
JOHNNY: What an honor.
ACE: Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me ! Ace makes a big friendly show of trading places with Johnny.
BRECKINRIDGE: Come on, Ace, back off the line ! Bacl off the line ! Now everyone's laughing, pushing Ace to the back of the line. Johnny has his grub. Dizzy comes up with her tray.
DIZZY: Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
JOHNNY: No thanks, Diz.
DIZZY: What's your malfunction, Rico ?
JOHNNY: You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
DIZZY: What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
JOHNNY: You saying you didn't ? Johnny turns away. Dizzy watches him go, hurt.
ACE: What makes you think. you'll make. squad leader, Rico ?
JOHNNY: Something. I've got.you don't.
ACE: You rich kids. are all the same !
JOHNNY: It isn't about rich. It's about who's best.! They come to a trap, prepare to leap.
DIZZY: Coming through ! Dizzy jumps over them from behind. Johnny and Ace tumble into the mud. They watch, chagrined, as Dizzy reaches the end of the course effortlessly.
ZIM: C'mon, move it, you apes !
KITTEN SMITH: We all have one thing in common. We were all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile Infanterie. What's your excuse, Breckinridge ?
BRECKINRIDGE: Well, my family is all farmers. I hate farming. Mobile Infantery's pure picnic by comparison.
KITTEN SMITH: So the grow 'em big and dumb on the farm planet, eh ? Djana'd ?
DJANA'D: I'm going in for politics. You gotta be a citizen for that. So here I am.
KITTEN SMITH: C'mon, keep it going. Katrina !
KATRINA: I wanna be a mom. It's easier to get a licence if you've served.
ACE: I'm going career. officer's training. That's why I wanna be squad leader. They look for that.
JOHNNY: Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
ACE: Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
JOHNNY: Well, maybe you better look again.
SHUJUMI: Federation's gonna give me a scholarship when my hitch is up. I wanna be a neurologist, study brain chemisty and associated stimulus. Dizzy dresses down. Johnny and all the other guys check her out. She has a fabulous body. Dizzy cathes Johnny looking. He turns his back as she steps into the shower next to him.
KITTEN SMITH: Your turn, Rico !
JOHNNY: Aw, who asked you to be so nosey ?
KITTEN SMITH: Me, I got plans to be writer, and a writer's got a right to be nosey. Flores, you know Rico from Buenos Aires. What's his story ? Dizzy uses her hand to divert the shower spray towards Johnny's crotch.
DIZZY: Well, some say he turned his back on the family fortune to be a citizen, others say he did it for a girl. missed a spot there, bucko. which is funny because Johnny says I joined up to be with him, but why would I do that ? He doesn't even like me.
BRECKINRIDGE: Don't look that way to me. Everyone look down at Johnny's crotch, laughing. Johnny blushes, grabs a towel and exits the shower.
JOHNNY: I know it's not much, but it's home. Over there's my bunk where I dream about you every night. Ace, Kitten Smith, Shujumi and Breckinridge dance around and moon the Hey, do you mind ? Johnny moves the camera away from the guys. Katrina walks by from the shower with Dizzy, mugs into frame.
JOHNNY: Hey, do you mind ? Johnny moves the camera away from the guys. Katrina walks by from the shower with Dizzy, mugs into frame.
KATRINA: Hey, what's going on ?
DIZZY: I bet it's that girl I was talking about. Her name's Carmen, I think.
KATRINA: Hi, Carmen ! Johnny heads for the door.
JOHNNY: Boot's pretty tough, and sometimes I think I won't make it, but then I imagine you're watching me, and that gives me someting. I try harder. Thanks to you, I think I might have a shot at squad leader. The barracks lights go out. Taps plays over the public address. Johnny lowers his voice.
JOHNNY: Uh-oh, I gotta pack it in. I hope you're having fun, hope you're careful. No training accidents for you, eh ? I want to kiss you so badly. I want to feel you next to me, I- Behind him , someone begins to sing , badly.
ACE: I love you truly, so truly, dear.! Ace, the singer, and the other guys peer down from the transom over the door, giggling, delighted with themselves.
ACE: Our love will grow, dear, year by year.
JOHNNY: Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys ! The letter ends. Carmen smiles. A BALD CADET PILOT smacks her on the arm as she runs by in a sleek blue pressure suit.
BALD CADET: Orbit in five, Ibanez ! First one there gets to fly ! Grinning, Carmen grabs her duffel, takes off after her.
CARMEN: Looking it down !
LATE CADET: Oh no, not Ibanez again, she's crazy !
CARMEN: On my mark, in three, two, one.
.GO !: 64 INT BOAT - LUNAR ORBIT - CARMEN
BALD CADET: Geez, I thought I liked to fly fast !
CARMEN: This is nothing. Today, I get to fly that ! She points. Now visible from behind a host of smaller ships, STARSHIP ATHENA, of older design, but impressive.
CARMEN: Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
DELADIER: Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
CARMEN: Yes, ma'am ! Carmen turns for her station, but stops in her tracks. Her supervisor is Zander Barcalow, now a 2nd Lieutenant.
CARMEN: Hey ! What are you doing here ?
ZANDER: I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate. Carmen logs on. The ship recognizes her as a pilot trainee.
CARMEN: Assistant insructor. You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
ZANDER: Only when I give you an order.
DELADIER: Prepare for departure. Carmen and Zander go to work.
CARMEN: It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
ZANDER: Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other.
DELADIER: Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
CARMEN: Yes, ma'am. All eyes are on carmen as she grabs the stick. The ship shudders under her hand. She winks at Zander.
CARMEN: In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
ZANDER: This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
CARMEN: Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
ZANDER: Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed. Carmen rocks the stick, and the view from the bridge spins smoothly away from the dense orbiting yards os Luna toward the outer system.
CARMEN: They revoke our flight status.
ZANDER: They revoke our flight status.
CARMEN: Oh, I see. teamwork. Carmen jogs past lumbering freighters. Zander's impressed.
DELADIER: Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
ZANDER: Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three. two. one. Space appears to bend. Zander and Carmen share a smile. They blur together, becoming one, then: WHAM !
ZIM: The object of this exercise is to capture your enemy's flag before your enemy captures yours. Bronski passes out Morita SmartRifles.
ZIM: These weapons have been modified for this exercise. If your enemy hits you, your suit will fail. You will be unable to move. You will be as good as dead.
DJANA'D: It's right over the next ridge. Only two guards. Johnny, Kitten Smith, and Dizzy open fire from athicket as they pass. Djana'd and the others collapse as their suits fail, Djana'd laughing because playing at war seems funny.
KITTEN SMITH: You are now prisoners of the Blue Team. Tell us your plans or die !
DJANA'D: Oh no ! Name, rank, and mind your own business is all you get from me !
KITTEN SMITH: I'm going in ! Let's go ! Kitten Smith makes arun for the flag with a rifle team. Ace and Katrina open fire from two new hidden Red Team positions, taking Kitten and his team down with a cross fire.
JOHNNY: Man, they're defended. no way in.
DIZZY: Flip six, three hole.
JOHNNY: What ?
DIZZY: High school. remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might Johnny looks at the course in a new way, nods.
JOHNNY: Cover me.
DIZZY: You got it. Johnny tumbles open ground, vaults into the air. Dizzy takes out Breckinridge as he rises to fire. Johnny lands, knocks out Katrina, then Ace. He picks up Ace's fallen Morita.
JOHNNY: Thanks, pal.
ZIM: Kid's got some moves.
ZIM: Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
JOHNNY: Sir, thank you, sir !
ZIM: Don't stand there dumb. GO ! Johnny jumps, plummeting toward the earth.
JOHNNY: Next in line, Ace scowls.
KITTEN SMITH: Look at him. Do you think anyone has ever been so pleased with himself ?
ACE: Zim hadda choose someone to be his brown nose, I guess.
JOHNNY: I just want you guys to know that I'll never do anything that I haven't asked you to do first. Johnny approaches Dizzy.
JOHNNY: Couldn't've done it without you, Diz. Friends ? Dizzy smiles, shakes.
DIZZY: Yeah, sure. friends. Bronski walks through with the mail.
BRONSKI: Levy. Shujumi. Rico. Johnny grabs the E-disk, pops it into his handcam. The Fleet Mail logo appears:
APPROVED MESSAGE: Bet it's from my girl. Johnny's pals gather for a look. Carmen appears, dressed down to skivvies, in her quarters aboard starship Athena.
JOHNNY: Bet it's from my girl. Johnny's pals gather for a look. Carmen appears, dressed down to skivvies, in her quarters aboard starship Athena.
CARMEN: Hi, Johnny, I would've written sooner, but they've really got us going every moment here.
ACE: Yeow, Rico, you don't deserve that !
JOHNNY: I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will. Johnny holds up his squad leader chevrons victoriously.
CARMEN: I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will. Johnny holds up his squad leader chevrons victoriously.
JOHNNY: All it takes is the love of a good woman. The image changes abrupltly. Now Carmen's wearing a trim blue flight suit. She stands the camera on Athena's gunnery deck. Outside , the rings of Saturn sparkle in bright solar light.
CARMEN: Look at that. Isn't it beautiful ? I had to show you. It's great to be out here on my own. I'm just not some little girl from Buenos Aires anymore. I'm gonna be a starship pilot, and I'm gonna see the And that's also the problem because I don't really want to get married, Johnny. I don't want to have kids. I want a command, a ship of my own, and you know, I don't think that's gonna leave a lot of room for you and Johnny is stunned. All the other recruits suddenly seem to have something else to do.
CARMEN: I know that's not what you wanted to hear. but I have to follow my heart. I'm sorry. I'm afraid you'll hate me, and I couldn't stand that. Write me, alright ? Write me, so I'll know that we'll always be friends. The Fleet Mail logo appears again: END OF MESSAGE. Johnny shuts the handcam off. Ace puts a hand on his shoulder.
ACE: Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
JOHNNY: It's what I deserve.
ACE: Whad'ya talkin about ?
JOHNNY: I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
ACE: You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick Johnny smiles in spite of himself.
JOHNNY: Thanks, Ace. Johnny turns for the door, flipping the chevrons like a coin. Dizzy watches him leave. She'd so like to comfort him.
ZIM: With the Marauder's visual capabilities, all you have to do is look at something to hit it, so you will exercise EXTREME CARE on my firing line. Do you get me ?
RECRUITS: Sir, yes, sir !
ZIM: The live firing combat range is the closest simulation of actual combat we can provide. If you do not hit your target, it will shoot you. Fifty blackened AUTOMATED TARGET DRONES fitted with pulse guns are presently visible along a gauntlet of low walls, gullies, and three-story building facades.
ZIM: The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
JOHNNY: Sir, yes, sir ! On a signal from Zim, the Live Fire Combat Range comes to life as the target drones take cover and disappear from view.
ZIM: Perfect score for this exercise is 300. B company came through last week with 285. I expect you to do better.
DJANA'D: You're in my line of fire, Breckinridge Before the others can react, a second drone appears.
JOHNNY: CROSSFIRE ! EVERYBODY DOWN ! Everyone kisses dirt. Pulses from the two drones fly thick overhead. Shujumi rises to fire, a round slams him back to the ground. Johnny and Djana'd knock out the two drones.
JOHNNY: Alright, no more screw ups. Ace takes point. Diz, you and Kitten Smith cover the flanks. Djana'd, you're rear guard. Move out. The squad resumes ist advance. Breckinridge bangs on his helmet. There is something wrong with his "head up" display.
JOHNNY: What's the problem ?
BRECKINRIDGE: Dunno. Display's fritzed.
DJANA'D: Lose another rifle, we're gonna mess up our score.
JOHNNY: Let me see. Breckinridge takes off helmet, hands it to Johnny. Djana'd turns on Breckinridge. Her "head up" zeroes him.
DJANA'D: How come when something goes wrong, it's always you, Breckinridge ? That's when Djana'd trips on a loose stone. She fumbles her rifle and it discharges. The round tears the top of Breckinridge's head off. The recruits stare in horror.
JOHNNY: Oh, God. uh. MEDIC ! Zim arrives with Bronski on the bounce.
ZIM: Rico, you are relieved of squad command. Levy, McIntire you will escort private Rico to the C.O.'s Office. The recruits watch Johnny leave, stare aghast at their dead comrade. No one looks at Djana'd, who stands alone sobbing.
JOHNNY: Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
JOHNNY: Sir, no, sir.
JOHNNY: Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir. I. I wanted to win, You disobeyed safety regulation 21-404. You may, of course, demand trial by court martial.
JOHNNY: Sir, no, sir !
JOHNNY: Sir. I guess I do, sir. Zim looks out the window. Djana'd, dressed for travel, in civilian clothes, crying as she heads off down Washout Lane.
ZIM: Alright, let's go, Rico. Johnny takes off his shirt. Ace who now holds the chevrons of squad leader, watches, feels bad for his pal.
ZIM: Bite on this. It helps. I know.
BRONSKI: CRACK ! Johnny's face wrenched by pain, spontanous tears, a terrible sound stifled by the bright red mouthpiece.
BRONSKI: CRACK ! Again. Dizzy flinches for Johnny.
BRONSKI: CRACK ! Ace looks away.
BRONSKI: CRACK ! Zim watches without any apparent emotion.
BRONSKI: CRACK ! Johnny faints, sagging against his tether.
FADE OUT: 78 EXT OUTER SYSTEM - STARSHIP ATHENA
CARMEN: Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
ZANDER: Oh, I don't know. Depends on who you are spending it with. He caresses her hair. She kisses his hand. Zander notices the plot map.
ZANDER: Profile's wrong. there.
CARMEN: No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
ZANDER: Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
CARMEN: Hey, check it. Zander slides into his chair, runs a check.
ZANDER: You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said.
CARMEN: Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
ZANDER: Well, whad'ya know.
CARMEN: Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
ZANDER: She got a command. and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
CARMEN: You and me, huh ? Zander turns his chair so they are very close, moves a finger along her hand, up her arm and playfully around her breasts.
ZANDER: I have a feeling about us. We're good together, way ahead of the curve in every department. I seem to be able to anticipate your needs. You know what I want. Carmen grabs him between his legs.
CARMEN: No, what do you want ? Zander pulls her to him and they kiss passionately. She brteaks it off, gets serious for amoment.
CARMEN: I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet.
ZANDER: Me, too. Day and Night-Cycle. They start to caress again when suddenly ALARMS sound. Captain Deladier appears on the hot screen, still waking up.
DELADIER: Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed. Carmen and Zander frantically check their displays.
ZANDER: Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed. Carmen and Zander frantically check their displays.
CARMEN: WHERE IS IT ? THERE ! GRAVITY FIELD. IT'S BIG ! It looks like an. asteroid.
ZANDER: THERE ! GRAVITY FIELD. IT'S BIG ! It looks like an. asteroid.
CARMEN: It looks like an. asteroid.
DELADIER: In this part of the system ? Carmen and Zander see it through the front screens: A huge ASTEROID tumbles directly towards them at terrific speed.
ZANDER: Sweet Jesus.! Carmen breaks glass that reads EMERGENCY RETROS, arms the switch within and fires the rockets.
DELADIER: Where'd it come from ?
ZANDER: Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
DELADIER: Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: Communications are down, ma'am.
DELADIER: Engineering. Damage assessment.
ENGINEERING OFFICER: Hull's compromised. We're lucky to be alive, ma'am. Deladier notices Carmen staring at a monitor, stunned. A DEAD CAP TROOPER trails in the wreckage of the flight deck.
DELADIER: Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
CARMEN: Thank you, ma'am.
DIZZY: It stinks, you goin.
JOHNNY: I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
DIZZY: If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
JOHNNY: Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it. Corporal Bronski leans in, impassive.
BRONSKI: Your call's going through, Rico. Take it there. A nearby VU-PHONE lights up. The screen flashes: RINGING His mother appears when she picks up the other end.
MOTHER: Hello. Oh, Johnny.!
JOHNNY: Hi, mom.
MOTHER: Bill. pick up. it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you. The screen splits as Johnny's father activates an extension.
FATHER: Johnny ! Where's your uniform.? Johnny's mother makes a face to shut him up.
FATHER: Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
JOHNNY: It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking. I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
MOTHER: Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
JOHNNY: I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid.
FATHER: Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
MOTHER: We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
FATHER: Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine . and. well, we love you, The sky in Buenos Aires seems to darken perceptively. Johnny's mother looks out the window.
MOTHER: Oh, my, what's that ?
FATHER: Looks like rain.
MOTHER: This time of the year.? The transmission ends abruptly. A phone company logo appears:
JOHNNY: Well, see ya.
DIZZY: You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
JOHNNY: What's that, Diz ?
DIZZY: That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen ! Dizzy turns on her heel and marches away.
JOHNNY: Hey, Kitten, what's going on ?
KITTEN: It's war !
OFFICIAL VOICE: . early estimates. Millions dead, a city in On screen, the smoldering ruins of what was once a huge city.
JOHNNY: Oh, jeez, is that Geneva ?
KATRINA: Goddam bugs whacked us, Johnny.
OFFICIAL VOICE: . Buenos Aires has been wiped of the Earth. Nothing lives in what was once called the Latin Paradise. Johnny is horrified. Dizzy is suddenly standing next to him.
DIZZY: Aw, Johnny, geez. It's home.
OFFICIAL VOICE: The Federal Court met moments ago and voted unanimously for mobilization to destroy the Arachnid threat. Johnny sets his jaw, turns and runs for the C.O.'s office.
OFFICIAL VOICE: The meteor derived from here, near Klendathu, in the Arachnid's home system.
ZIM: I'm serious, sir. I'll go anywhere. I want combat.
ZIM: Yes, sir, I get you.
JOHNNY: Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
JOHNNY: Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir. Sir, my family. my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir. Zim picks up Johnny's 1240/A off the C.O.'s desk.
ZIM: Is that your signature, Rico ?
JOHNNY: Sir, yes it is, sir.
ZIM: Doesn't look like it to me. Zim gives the C.O. a look. The C.O. shrugs, turns away, watching the news of the coming war. Zim tears up the 1240/A.
ZIM: Get outa here, private.
OFFICIAL VOICE: Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires comes first sorrow, then ANGER !
ANGRY PERSON: The only good bug is a dead bug !
OFFICIAL VOICE: Would you like to know more ?
OFFICIAL VOICE: Cap Troopers establish a foothold on Dantana, a planet system at the outer edge of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. Casualties are high, but casualties won't stop the Mobile Infantery ! Would you like to know more ?
OFFICIAL VOICE: Everyone's doing their share. Are you ? The war effort needs your effort at work, at home, in your community. Would you like to know more ?
OFFICIAL VOICE: Sky Marshall Dienes announces plans for an offensive against Klendathu, source of the bug meteor that destroyed Buenos Aires.
OFFICIAL VOICE: We now break net and take you live to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
NET CORRESPONDENT: No one here in the AQZ knows when the invasion of Kendathu will occur, but everyone's talking about it, and the talk says tomorrow ! Newly minted cap troopres Johnny, Dizzy, Ace, and Kitten Smith happen along.
NET CORRESPONDENT: Here's a bunch of M.I. kids who look like they eat bugs for lunch !
DIZZY: Yum, yum yum .!
NET CORRESPONDENT: So you're not to worried about fighting the Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole, lotta dead bugs, am I right ?
ACE: Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole, lotta dead bugs, am I right ?
KITTEN SMITH: I just hope it's not over before we get in it !
NET CORRESPONDENT: Some say the bugs were provoked by human attempts to colonize within the AQZ, that a "live and let live" policy is preferable to war with the bugs.
JOHNNY: Yeah, well, I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill'em all !
KITTEN SMITH: That guy's been in it.
JOHNNY: How can you tell ?
KITTEN SMITH: The eyes. He's got the 1000 meters stare. He's hard and humorless, all wised up. Ace admires his LASER CUT TATTOOS. Dizzy eyes his skull and crossbone earring.
ACE: Great scars.
DIZZY: I like the jewelry. Hey, amigo, where can I get an earring like yours ?
VETERAN: Port Joe Smith, Outer Rings, Dantana. Every time I come back from a drop, my gunny gives me a bone. I got three now. You don't see a lot of guys with three.
JOHNNY: Waht's it like. combat ?
VETERAN: I guess it's not so bad. I mean as long as you don't get any on you.
KITTEN SMITH: Get any what on you ?
VETERAN: Oh, you'll know when it happens. See you on the bounce. The veteran pays his tab and heads out.
ACE: I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
JOHNNY: What do I want with a scar ?
DIZZY: What, your skin's too pretty ? C'mon, everyone's doing it !
JOHNNY: Carmen. ? Johnny remembers himself, snaps to attention, salutes. Dizzy and the others follow suit. Carmen salutes back, sheepish.
CARMEN: Oh. at ease. Guess I oughta lose the hat when I'm off duty, eh ? Dizzy, disgusted, turns back to Ace and Kitten Smith. Carmen tucks her hat under her arm. Her hair is very short.
JOHNNY: What happened to your hair ?
CARMEN: What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
JOHNNY: It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ? Carmen shakes her head, sadly.
CARMEN: It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
JOHNNY: I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
CARMEN: You don't look very happy to see me.
JOHNNY: Should I be ?
CARMEN: Johnny. Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us. Zander leaves a group of FLEET OFFICERS to join them.
ZANDER: Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
CARMEN: Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now. Zander puts his arm around Carmen, gives her a squeeze.
ZANDER: Best in the Fleet !
JOHNNY: I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ? Johnny turns to leave.
CARMEN: Johnny, wait.
ZANDER: Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude. Johnny turns back to face Zander.
JOHNNY: You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
ZANDER: You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
JOHNNY: Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap Everyone can see what's about to happen. A circle is forming, Fleet on one side, Mobile Infantery on the other.
ZANDER: Let's disregaed rank. Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
CARMEN: Zander, please. Let's go ! Zander takes off his hat.
ZANDER: It's alright. What's he gonna do ? WHAM ! Johnny punches him right in the nose. Zander goes down, bleeding. Ace and Kitten Smith grab Johnny.
ACE: Whoa, easy there, buddy. Nice punch. Zander staggers to his feet, ready to fight, but Fleet Officers pull him back. Carmen looks at Johnny, the hate in his eye, the blood on his fist.
CARMEN: What's wrong with you ?
JOHNNY: Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation. bitch. Carmen turns away, stung. Johnny immediately regrets. Dizzy, for her part, couldn't be happier.
DIZZY: Forget it, Johnny. Cap Troopers and Fleet weren't meant to mix !
JOHNNY: It hurts.! Dizzy, Ace, and Kitten Smith awtch, grinning, passing a bottle. Ace pours booze directly into the fresh wound.
ACE: No, this hurts.
JOHNNY: YAAAAAAAA ! Well, here's to it ! We're gonna fightn, and we're gonna win ! They put their arms side by side. Each has a similiar scar: Lightning bolts on a shield and the words: DEATH FROM ABOVE.
YAAAAAAAA !: KITTEN SMITH Well, here's to it ! We're gonna fightn, and we're gonna win ! They put their arms side by side. Each has a similiar scar: Lightning bolts on a shield and the words: DEATH FROM ABOVE.
KITTEN SMITH: Well, here's to it ! We're gonna fightn, and we're gonna win ! They put their arms side by side. Each has a similiar scar: Lightning bolts on a shield and the words: DEATH FROM ABOVE.
ACE: Mobile Infantery rules !
JOHNNY: Death to all bugs !
DIZZY: Don't get any on you !
ACE: Officer on deck ! Everyone snaps to attention.
LT. WILLY: At ease. Alright. we got hot poop straight from the top: Willy's Wildcats is in with the first wave. Means more bugs for us to kill. This does nothing to break the tension. Lt. Willy reassures.
LT. WILLY: Now if you follow orders and remember your training, I guarantee you'll make it back alive. Any questions ? There are none.
LT. WILLY: Alright. next we got a little last minute briefing from Military Intelli-gence I think you're gonna like. The briefingplays on "head up" displays and the ready room screens. A captive BUG WARRIOR clicks and shrieks as FEDERAL SCIENTISTS torture it. The troopers cheer.
OFFICIAL VOICE: Everyday Federal scientists are looking for new ways to kill bugs and you can help. The head scientists turns and speaks to camera. It's Carl. Johnny and Dizzy share an amazed grin, noticing a difference in their old friend, something that speaks of. authority.
CARL: To defeat the enemy, we must know the enemy. Take for instance your basic Arachnid warrior. Minimal IQ, armored, completely lethal. You can blow a limb off. Carl picks up apulse gun and blows one of the bugs legs off. The insect screams.
CARL: . and it's still 86% combat effec-tive. But here's a tip: Aim for the nerve stem and put it down for good. Carl fires again. The bug kicks and squeals as it dies. Carl tosses the pulse gun aside.
CARL: Now while you are out killing bugs, we want you to be our eyes and ears. The bugs use some kind of plasma burst to divert meteors and aim them toward Earth. We need to know how they do this. If you encounter any plasma, report it immediately to your superior. Good luck and good hunting ! The briefing ends as klaxons sound.
LT. WILLY: Move out ! Johnny and the other troopers climb into capsules on the port track. Dizzy gives him "thumbs up". The capsule seals as it moves with the others down the firing tube.
LT. WILLY: Smash the entire area, kill anything that has more'n a couple legs , and don't any of you loafers come back aboard with unexpended bombs. Get me ?
CARMEN: Plasma, ma'am. from the planet.
DELADIER: Bug Batteries. According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
ZANDER: Drop is 35% complete, ma'am. Two more bursts of bug plasma streak past.
DELADIER: Steady as she goes, Number 1.
DELADIER: This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake.!
ZANDER: That's it, we're empty ma'am ! Out the front screens, a blast from below hits George Marshall amidships and it reels into Yamamoto. Both starships begin to burn.
DELADIER: Someone made a big goddam mistake ! Get us out of here, Number 1 ! Carmen dodges past burning ships, avoids collision with Dauntless, and then KA-WHAM ! they're hit. Carmen flies out of her station and into CAMERA hard.
LIEUTENANT WILLY: Up there on the ridge ! We'll nuke those bug positions from theAAAAAAAA ! A HOPPER ( an airborne Arachnid warrior with powerful rear legs and "pop out" wings for gliding ) lands on Lieutenant Willy and cracks his head like a nut.
ACE: KILL IT ! Johnny and Ace open fire, backing away. Pulse rounds tear it apart, bug guts Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge.?
JOHNNY: Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge.?
ACE: I didn't see him ! Now comes a flood of WORKERS building ever advancing fortifications, and with them, hundreds of deadly ARACHNID WARRIORS.
KITTEN SMITH: Here they come.!
DIZZY: Ace, what're we doing ?
ACE: I uh. uh. Dizzy and the others open fire simultanously. The whole area goes white hot in the magnesium flash of so many pulse cannons. Shujumi fires wildly at advancing insects.
SHUJUMI: You want some ? Here's some !
C'MON !: Don't waste your ammon on the workers ! Shujumi can't hear. A warrior finds him, rips his leg off, hurls him back into the waiting jaws of the oncoming bugs.
JOHNNY: Don't waste your ammon on the workers ! Shujumi can't hear. A warrior finds him, rips his leg off, hurls him back into the waiting jaws of the oncoming bugs.
SHUJUMI: AAAAAAAAAAAA ! He fights, screaming. A claw reaches for his face, ripping the top of his head off.
AAAAAAAAAAAA !: He fights, screaming. A claw reaches for his face, ripping the top of his head off.
KATRINA: Let's get out of here ! Now the ground opens behind her and a huge ( 6 meters ) TANKER BUG lumbers out of the ground, it's funnel-shaped snout extruding above multiple eyes.
DIZZY: Look out ! The tanker bug sprays and hits Katrina. She screams, as her legs melt out from under her.
KATRINA: AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Warriors converge to feed on her. Ace wants to help her, but Johnny blocks him.
AAAAAAAAAAAAA !: Warriors converge to feed on her. Ace wants to help her, but Johnny blocks him.
JOHNNY: C'mon, Katrina was right. We gotta get out of here !
JOHNNY: It's a general retreat ! The boats are coming down. They come to the rear lines where the Net Correspondent and his CAMERAMAN are doing live coverage of the invasion.
NET CORRESPONDENT: We've just landed here on what cap troopers are calling the "Big K" with the 6th Mobile Infantery Division. It's an ugly planet, a bug planet, a planet hostile to life as we kow iGKKKKK ! The Correspondent is cut in half by a warrior. Johnny blows it away.
JOHNNY: C'mon, let's go ! ON THE BOUNCE ! The cap troopers move out. Kitten Smith looks up as a purple beacon streaks acroos thr sky.
KITTEN SMITH: I can see the beacon.!
ACE: Retrieval ! A hopper pounces on Kitten Smithm, and he goes down screaming.
JOHNNY: KITTEN ! Johnny touches down, stares in horror as Kitten Smith's head rolls past his fee. Johnny opens up with his pulse cannon. The hopper attacks, puts a claw right through Johnny's thigh.
KITTEN !: Johnny touches down, stares in horror as Kitten Smith's head rolls past his fee. Johnny opens up with his pulse cannon. The hopper attacks, puts a claw right through Johnny's thigh.
JOHNNY: AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Crushing jaws close around him, crushing, cutting his flesh. Johnny brings the muzzle of the pulse gun under the hopper's nerve stem and SPLAT ! blows its head apart.
AAAAAAAAAAAAA !: Crushing jaws close around him, crushing, cutting his flesh. Johnny brings the muzzle of the pulse gun under the hopper's nerve stem and SPLAT ! blows its head apart.
DIZZY: Johnny ! JOHNNY ! WHERE ARE YOU ? JOHNNY ! Johnny.! But Dizzy can't find Johnny, and soon she's lost in the smoke. Johnny looks down at the terrible hole in his leg where bright arterial blood gushes.
JOHNNY: Medic. MEDIC.! Now two more Arachnid warriors close in on him through the enveloping smoke. He fires his pulse rifle empty, and dropping it, crawls desperately, dragging his useless leg.
JOHNNY: Oh, God. Oh, God, help me. please help me.! A third Arachnid warrior rears up in front of him, deadly jaws slashing down toward him, when suddenly it is blown to pieces in the blinding blast of a point-blank pulse cannon.
FADE OUT: 111 FROM THE FEDERAL NET - 100, 000 DEAD IN ONE HOUR !
OFFICIAL VOICE: Crsisis for Humankind ! Fleet official admit they underestimated the Arachnid's defensive capability. Would you like to know more ?
OFFICIAL VOICE: Accepting responsibility for Klendathu, Sky Marshall Dienes resigns. His successor, Sky Marshall Tahat Meru, outlines her new Until we understand the bug better, we must proceed with caution. We can ill afford another Klendathu.
OFFICIAL VOICE: To explain the intelligent military actions of the Arachnids, Federal Scientists postulate the existence of a leadership caste.BRAIN BUGS !
OFFICIAL VOICE: Families oof those who have died or become incapacitated by Federal Service are entitled to benefits ! If you see the name of a loved one, please do not call. A Federation official will call you. Would you like to know more ?
CARMEN: stare at the BATTLE-SCARED STARSHIPS and BURNT-OUT HULKS that line the docks of Ticonderoga.
CARMEN: You know, we're lucky to be alive. A bloody bandage wraps Carmen's head. Zander nods grimly.
ZANDER: Give me hand, willya ? Carmen takes his hand. Zander kisses her.
ZANDER: I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
CARMEN: You weren't thinking.you were dreaming !
ZANDER: If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
CARMEN: There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too.
ZANDER: So ?
CARMEN: So who's got time to get married ? Carmen lets his hand go and leaps through the hatch. Zander falls back onto the conveyer belt, finds himself eyeball-to-eyeball with a horribly maimed trooper, scrambles to get off.
ZANDER: Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
CARMEN: I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
ZANDER: I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
CARMEN: No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
ZANDER: Hey, bugs don't take prisoners. Carmen looks at the words at the Net terminal: WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE ? She bites her lip, enters Johnny's name. In an instant, she has the news:
CARMEN: Oh no. Tears fill her eyes.
ZANDER: Excuse me.! She rushes away. Zander looks at Johnny's name on the screen, shrugs, presses the ERASE button.
CARMEN: Excuse me.! She rushes away. Zander looks at Johnny's name on the screen, shrugs, presses the ERASE button.
ZANDER: I'm sorry, Carmen.
CARMEN: Please, I. Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any Zander puts an arm around her. She holds on tight.
CARMEN: No, I. Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
ZANDER: You're upset, that's alright. Zander kisses her hair. Tears roll down her face.
CARMEN: No, don't you see ? No one can wait for anything anymore. You're right. We should get married. Zander holds Carmen as she sobs, feeling lucky.
DIZZY: Two more days. Johnny's wounds are now mostly scars except for his leg where delicate robotic arms culture layers of new tissue. Johnny gives a weak thumbs up. The knocking sound continues. Johnny turns. A STEEL HAND taps the side of the tank. Johnny grins, astonished. The man wearing it is his former high school teacher, now a Lieutenant, Jean Rasczak.
ACE: Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires.
JOHNNY: He was our teacher. He was great.
ACE: Yeah, well, I hear he's a real The Roughnecks killed more bugs than any other outfit in 2nd Brigade. Only took 15% casualties on Big K. They size up the Roughnecks. There are scars, power prosthetics, and one, big SUGAR WATKINS, 26, wears a bug claw on a chain around his neck.
DIZZY: The Roughnecks killed more bugs than any other outfit in 2nd Brigade. Only took 15% casualties on Big K. They size up the Roughnecks. There are scars, power prosthetics, and one, big SUGAR WATKINS, 26, wears a bug claw on a chain around his neck.
JOHNNY: Seeing as how we're about all that's left of 1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement. You top kick ?
SUGAR WATKINS: Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
JOHNNY: I wouldn't mind. CORPORAL BIRDIE, 24, turns, gives Johnny the once over.
BIRDIE: I would. Nice earring. Dizzy looks her over. Not too big, but she's tough.
DIZZY: Where you been besides Big K ?
BIRDIE: Outer rings. Zegema Beach.
JOHNNY: I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
SUGAR WATKINS: Good luck. It's not there anymore.
ACE: Is your Lieutenant as bad as they say ? Birdie belts him, and Ace goes down.
BIRDIE: No one talks about the Lieutenant that way. He saved my life ! Ace jumps up, ready to fight, but other Roughnecks block him.
SUGAR WATKINS: Mine, too.
OTHER ROUGHNECKS: Same for me. me, too. Johnny and Dizzy shrug. Ace's on his own.
ACE: Sounds like he is quite a guy.
GILLESPIE: Attention ! Everyone snaps to. Rasczak enters.
RASCZAK: This is for you new people. I only have two rules. Rule one, everyone fights. Rule two, no one quits. If you don't do your job, I'll kill you myself. Do you get me ?
RASCZAK: Get rid of the jewelry. I hate it. Welcome to the Roughnecks.
BIRDIE: Rasczak's Roughnecks ! The Roughnecks cheer. Rasczak smiles vaguely.
RASCZAK: Alright. There's a new Sky Marshall and a new plan. We're gonna clean out the systems outlying Klendathu one planet at a time. Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla. After Fleet glasses the planet, M.I. mops up.
RASCZAK: Spread out, teams of three. When you locate a bug hole, secure it, gas it, and close it.
ACE: Rockets take out warriors. Bug guts go flying. Dizzy sets workers on fire. Johnnx and Ace step over burning bug carcasses to the rim of the hole and fire their gas rounds.
JOHNNY: Fire in the hole ! Johnny drops an H.E. round, and they're in the air when the explosion collapses the entrance to the bug city.
JOHNNY: Looks like you've got a little bug problem, ma'am.
BIRDIE: Stow it, trooper. Give it verything you've got ! The cao troopers let the bugs have it, but the insects keep coming, the living crawling over the dead, and now, trudging up out of the ground, comes a
JOHNNY: WATCH OUT ! The tanker bug starts to spray, creating a toxic perimeter around the hole. Rasczak arrives just as Birdie takes a chemical hit, falling to ground minus an arm, screaming.
BIRDIE: AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Johnny jumps, landing behind the tanker bug in the mouth of the hole. It turns with surprising speed. Johnny flips up onto its back, cracks its armor with his pulse cannon.
AAAAAAAAAAAAA !: Johnny jumps, landing behind the tanker bug in the mouth of the hole. It turns with surprising speed. Johnny flips up onto its back, cracks its armor with his pulse cannon.
RASCZAK: Sugar, in for pick up ! Rasczak and Sugar Watkins pull Birdie to safety. Johnny fires a rocket into the hole he's made in the tanker bug's back, and jumps clear. KA-WHAP ! The big bug explodes.
RASCZAK: Gas that hole and close it ! The Roughnecks fire gas rockets into the bug hole. Johnny touches down beside Rasczak.
RASCZAK: Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
JOHNNY: Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better. Rasczak turns away, gives Birdie prosthetic thumps up as she is carried past to meet an arriving skimmer.
RASCZAK: I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better. Rasczak turns away, gives Birdie prosthetic thumps up as she is carried past to meet an arriving skimmer.
RASCZAK: Don't worry, Birdie, your next arm comes with a factory guarantee ! Dizzy and Ace gather around Johnny, clap him on the back.
DIZZY: Way to go, amigo !
JOHNNY: I'm gonna need a squad leader.
ACE: No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive What about it, Diz ?
JOHNNY: What about it, Diz ?
DIZZY: ( a snappy salute ) Looks like I'm your girl, sir. Tac Fighters reel by over head. WOMP ! Suddenly, BUG PLASMA shoots skyward from the flatlands below. Several Tac Fighters are blown out of the air. Flaming debris rains down.
RASCZAK: Saddle up, Roughnecks. That's our trash ! Roughnecks head out on the bounce.
JOHNNY: What kind of stinkin' bug is that ? Johnny jumps the magnification on his "head up". Down in the pit, a giant translucent PLASMA BUG rears out of one of the subterranean tunnels that ring the battery.
SUGAR WATKINS: You never seen how they do it before ? Johnny shakes his head. Swollen BREEDER BUGS gather around the plasma bug to inject it with their catalytic jelly.
ACE: Agghh ! It's making me sick.! The plasma bug writhes in pain and begins to swell, color changing from yellow to blue in accordance with some violent internal chemical reaction.
SUGAR WATKINS: It's gonna pop ! WOMP ! The plasma bug explodes in its cauldron. A blast of bug plasma streaks past them towards the heavens. Now a new plasma bug crawls into the pit to begin the cycle anew.
GILLESPIE: Sir, look ! Sergeant Gillespie points. A hole opens near the battery and dozens of warriors rampage out of the ground and up the cliff face toward the Roughneck position.
RASCZAK: We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
GILLESPIE: Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over .? Rasczak moves off down the line giving orders.
RASCZAK: Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
GILLESPIE: Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance. They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
RASCZAK: They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
DIZZY: That'd be me, sir.
RASCZAK: Heat it up. Dizzy activates a tactical nuke. It makes a distinctive HIGHPITCHED SQUEAL.
RASCZAK: Roughnecks, you may fire at will. The Roughnecks open fire. Bugs are blown to pieces but they keep climbing. A warrior breeches their line. Sugar Watkins torches it. The nuke's ready light flashes.
DIZZY: I'm hot, sir !
RASCZAK: FIRE ! BLAST SHIELDS DOWN ! Johnny blows a warrior away from the edge. Dizzy leans over and fires. The rocket streaks down toward the battery.
RASCZAK: HIT THE DIRT ! An explosion in the two kiloton range turns the world black and white. When color returns Johnny and the others look down on the smoldering crater which was once the bug battery.
GILLESPIE: Now comes the part I hate the most.
JOHNNY: What's that ?
GILLESPIE: We go down into the colony and make sure all the queens are dead.
SUGAR WATKINS: You knew the Lieutenant before the war. What was he like ?
JOHNNY: He was a teacher , kind of a know it all. Always had this little smile.
SUGAR WATKINS: Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared. Johnny joins Rasczak, Ace and Dizzy and they blow away several warriors guarding the entrance of a large chamber.
JOHNNY: Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared. Johnny joins Rasczak, Ace and Dizzy and they blow away several warriors guarding the entrance of a large chamber.
JOHNNY: All dead except one, sir.
RASCZAK: Kill the bitch.
JOHNNY: Yes, sir. Johnny signals. Dizzy's pulse cannon rips open the dying queen. Thousands of wriggling premature bugs come spilling out. Horrified, knee-deep Roughnecks set them afire.
RASCZAK: Tango Urilla is now bug free. Means the Roughnecks have killed a helluva lotta bugs.! Roughnecks cheer. Rasczak kicks open a CARGO MODULE. Beer kegs rool out. He kicks open a second module. Inside, musical instruments. Ace picks up a violin.
RASCZAK: I expect the best, but I give the best. Habve some fun. That's an order !
DIZZY: Nah, I don't do that anymore.
JOHNNY: Nah, I don't do that anymore.
DIZZY: You used to dance.
JOHNNY: I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
DIZZY: Well, excuse me, sir. Dizzy heads back to the others. Johnny turns and finds Rasczak regarding him with an odd, sad smile.
RASCZAK: Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
JOHNNY: Yes, sir.
RASCZAK: Never pass up a good thing, eh ? Gillespie appears.
GILLESPIE: Lieutenant, Brigade's on the com. Rasczak heads away. Johnny joins Dizzy.
JOHNNY: Hey, Diz.
DIZZY: What ? Johnny takes her hand, bows implishly.
JOHNNY: May I have the honor ? He pulls her out among the others and they begin to dance. Ace watches with a grin, puts some spirit in his fiddle.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
RASCZAK: I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
RASCZAK: Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers The Intelligence Officer reddens.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
RASCZAK: My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Bugs don't lay traps. They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
CARL: This conference is over. Do your duty, Lieutenant. That's an order. Rasczak recovers, salutes stiffly.
RASCZAK: Yes, sir.
RASCZAK: Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
JOHNNY: Yes, sir !
RASCZAK: Who's that with you ? Dizzy shows herself, grinning.
RASCZAK: Report in ten minutes. Rasczak slams the door shut on them. They fall back into one anothers arms, laughing as they resume lovemaking.
DIZZY: Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
JOHNNY: They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
GILLESPIE: I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th not even their transponder.
RASCZAK: Keep trying, Sergeant.
JOHNNY: The hoppers hit. Several Roughnecks go down. Everyone opens up. Dive-bombing bugs are blown to bits. Roughnecks set them on fire when they hit the ground.
BUGS.!: The hoppers hit. Several Roughnecks go down. Everyone opens up. Dive-bombing bugs are blown to bits. Roughnecks set them on fire when they hit the ground.
DIZZY: Johnny, watch out ! A burning bug hurls itself at Johnny. Johnny jumps out of the way as Dizzy fires, blowing it apart. The deadly hoppers seem to be everywhere above them in the rocks.
RASCZAK: LET'S GO ! ON THE BOUNCE ! 136 EXT FLAT LANDS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS move out into the open. In the distance they see 4th Brigade HQ, a walled compound and partially constructed landing pad.
RASCZAK: Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
GILLESPIE: AAAAAAAAAAA ! Two hoppers are pulling Gillespie up into the rocks where other bugs join to feast.
AAAAAAAAAAA !: Two hoppers are pulling Gillespie up into the rocks where other bugs join to feast.
RASCZAK: Throw a rifle ! Dizzy tosses her Morita to Rasczak. Gillespie writhes in the hopper's claws. Rasczak fires, killing Gillespie.
RASCZAK: I expext any one here to do the same for me. Rico, Watkins, Flores, Levy prepare for rear guard action. The rest of you make for 4th Brigade. Johnny and the others cover the Roughneck retreat as hoppers soar down on the flat lands from the canyon walls.
RASCZAK: Johnny and the others blast bugs out of the air.
FIRE.!: Johnny and the others blast bugs out of the air.
RASCZAK: FALL BACK 100 METERS.! A second wave of hoppers come in.
RASCZAK: AND FIRE.! For now, the sky is clear.
AND FIRE.!: For now, the sky is clear.
RASCZAK: 4TH BRIGADE HQ ! ON THE BOUNCE ! 137 EXT 4TH BRIGADE HQ - DAY - THE OUTPOST is 50 meters by 100, standard issue pre-fab. The Roughnecks land on the compound wall. Inside, WORKER BUGS graze on the remains of 200 dead cap troopers strewn over the complex.
RASCZAK: Jeez, Command really humped the bunk on this one. Rasczak turns away. Roughnecks engage in the sport of methodically killing the workers.
RASCZAK: Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
JOHNNY: Yes, sir.
JOHNNY: Diz, see what you can do.
DIZZY: I'm on it ! Dizzy goes to work. Rasczak checks the wound in the back of the dead major's What's that look like to you, Rico ?
RASCZAK: What's that look like to you, Rico ?
JOHNNY: Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
ACE: Dirty bugs came in right when they were having chow !
RASCZAK: Gas that hole and seal it. Then they hear a sound. Tap tap tap. Rasczak signals for quiet. Tap tap tap tap. It's coming from the kitchen.
ACE: Officer on the deck, sir.
RASCZAK: Pick up the general ! Roughnecks prop him up. General Owen tries to talk, but no words come out. Rasczak bends down to listen.
GENERAL OWEN: Get out. you gotta get me out.!
RASCZAK: General Owen, sir ? The old man grins, hugely relieved.
GENERAL OWEN: At ease, Lieutenant. Thank God for you, for all of you.this is grand. so where's the boat ?
GENERAL OWEN: I was forced to hide, of course. The security of the Federation in this theater of operations was at stake !
JOHNNY: Diz, what's with the uplink ? Dizzy lokks up from where she is working on the radio controls.
DIZZY: Workin on it.!
GENERAL OWEN: They get in your mind. they make you do things ! Look here. They did it to Farley.! He points at the hole of the dead major's head.
RASCZAK: The distress call. The bugs wanted us to rescue you.!
GENERAL OWEN: Oh, you can be sure of it ! They were biding their time. waiting for the most opportune moment ! Rasczak's lost interest in the general. He's on the com.
RASCZAK: To all Roughnecks, this is Rasczak. Prepare for attack. Repeat. We are going to be attacked.!
GENERAL OWEN: They weren't gonna do it to me. Oh no ! I know too many secrets ! Rasczak looks at General Owen with contempt.
GENERAL OWEN: Oh God.! My soldiers.! All of my boys and girls.! The Roughnecks are shocked. They've never seen a general break down before. Lieutenant Rasczak slaps Owen hard.
LT. RASCZAK: Shut up ! Your soldier's dead and you're not !
GENERAL OWEN: I know. I wish you'd shoot me.
LT. RASCZAK: I oughta ! And it looks like Rasczak just might, but just then Ace touches down next to Johnny and Rasczak.
ACE: Lieutenant, we got trouble !
RASCZAK: Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
JOHNNY: What's going on, Diz ?
JOHNNY: We don't have a minute !
DIZZY: What frequency ?
JOHNNY: All bands.
DIZZY: Roughneck patrol to battle group. Roughneck patrol to battle group.
JOHNNY: SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
JOHNNY: Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
JOHNNY: Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy ! Johnny races out the door.
JOHNNY: Boat coming down, sir ! The Roughnecks stop firing as they run out of nukes.
ROUGHNECKS: I'm empty.all nuked out. Me, too ! Johnny scans the battlefield. Nukes have turned the surface into dark glass. Now, out of the smoke, come the bugs, steaming glass cracking beneath millions of marching feet.
ACE: Jeez, we musta killed a million already.!
JOHNNY: Not enough, I guess. Sugar Watkins sees Genera Owen in the compound below, stumbling aimlessly among his dead soldiers.
SUGAR WATKINS: General ! GENERAL, stay with the wounded. Sir, the general.!
RASCZAK: Ah, the hell with him. Hoppers sweep into the compound. The Roughnecks open fire. General Owen make easy pickings for ones that get through.
RASCZAK: Fall back. form a circle ! If no living bug comes over that wall, we cannot be harmed. Dizzy arrives on thr bounce as the Roughnecks fall back into the compound. Bugs pile in over the walls. The circle affords them 360 degrees of kill zone.
RASCZAK: Rico, Flores, Watkins, Levy ! We control the sky until retrieval !
ACE: Getting low here, sir !
DIZZY: 300 rounds and counting, sir !
RASCZAK: Make every shot count ! Johnny looks up. A RETRIEVAL BOAT hurtles down through bursts of bug plasma, takes a grazing hit, rights itself with retros and lands within the circle. Roughnecks cheer, saved !
RASCZAK: Sergeant, secure the boat !
JOHNNY: Yes, sir ! Roughnecks move to protect the boat. The hatch blows open.
RASCZAK: Board the wounded ! Dead bugs ring the compound walls, forming ramps for living insect soldiers to enter the compound in greater numbers.
RASCZAK: Move to retrieval on my command ! First group, now.! The circle shrinks as Roughnecks fall back and board the boat. More and more bugs pile in over the compound walls.
RASCZAK: Alright, Flores ! Levy ! Rico.! Suddenly, the ground collapses under Rasczak. He falls in to his waist, vomits blood as something chews on him from below.
RASCZAK: AAAAAAAAAAAA ! Cover us, Ace ! Ace and the others fire from the boat. Johnny and Dizzy fire at the ground around Rasczak. Rasczak stops screaming. They try to pull him free.
AAAAAAAAAAAA !: Cover us, Ace ! Ace and the others fire from the boat. Johnny and Dizzy fire at the ground around Rasczak. Rasczak stops screaming. They try to pull him free.
JOHNNY: Cover us, Ace ! Ace and the others fire from the boat. Johnny and Dizzy fire at the ground around Rasczak. Rasczak stops screaming. They try to pull him free.
JOHNNY: Hit your jets, sir !
RASCZAK: I can't My legs are gone. Get on the boat. The compund wall collapses. A wave of bugs charges in.
RASCZAK: Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time.
JOHNNY: We're not leaving you here, sir ! Weakly, Rasczak picks up his pulse gun, checks the power.
RASCZAK: This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
JOHNNY: Give'em hell, sir ! Johnny and Dizzy run for the boat. Rasczak opens fire, picking his shots, but soon the bugs are all over him.
RASCZAK: C'mon you sons of bitches ! There's no bug alive can kill a real mAAAAAAA ! At the boat, Dizzy turns to look back at Rasczak. A hopper swoops down on Dizzy, it's claws ripping into her abdomen.
DIZZY: AAAAAAA ! GET IT OFF ME GET IT OFF GET IT OFF GET IT AAAAAAAAAA ! Johnny blows the bug off her back. Blood sprays from a deep gash in her neck. Johnny picks her up, tries to stop the blood with his hand. The life is leaving her eyes.
JOHNNY: Hang on, Diz. don't die on me. A TANKER BUG breaches the broken wall. Ace jumps out to help his friends. The hatch closes just as the tanker bug sprays. The boat blasts off, dripping metal.
DIZZY: I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
JOHNNY: No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
DIZZY: It's alright 'cause I got to have you, MEDICS push Johnny aside, go to work on Dizzy.
JOHNNY: Get on the com and tell Fleet to glass that rock.! The co-pilot turns around. It's Zander. His eyes narrow.
ZANDER: On whose authority, Corporal ?
JOHNNY: This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission. The pilot turns around. It's Carmen.
CARMEN: Johnny.! I thought you were dead !
JOHNNY: I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet ! Johnny leaves. Carmen punches up Fleet Command.
CARMEN: Rodger Young, this is inbound shuttle De Ruyter with an official request from the Mobile Infantery to bombard Planet P-11.
DIZZY: JOHNNY HEH HEH CAN'T HEH BREATHE GOD JOHNNY CAN'T HEH HEH HEH HEH.! Dizzy dies. A Medic slaps her. Her head lolls, mouth open, eyes blank. They drop her and move on to the next casualty. Johnny sits there, stunned. Carmen enters from the cockpit.
CARMEN: Negative on your request. Fleet Command has the battle group on standby. Carmen sees Dizzy lying dead on the deck.
CARMEN: .I'm sorry.
JOHNNY: We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here. She points out for a viewing port. Johnny looks. Fifteen battle groups, 100 ships strong, lay off Planet P, all of them dwarfed by the Sky Marshall's flagship, Buenos Aires.
CARMEN: No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here. She points out for a viewing port. Johnny looks. Fifteen battle groups, 100 ships strong, lay off Planet P, all of them dwarfed by the Sky Marshall's flagship, Buenos Aires.
CARMEN: I thought you were KIA, Johnny.
JOHNNY: That was just a mix up.
CARMEN: You look so. I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
JOHNNY: What happened to your eye ? Carmen touches the scar over her eye.
CARMEN: Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
JOHNNY: I like it. It's kinda.you.
ZANDER: Where are you going ?
CARMEN: A funeral.
ZANDER: That girl who died on the way up .his girl ?
CARMEN: How do you feel about him now ?
ZANDER: How do you feel about him now ?
CARMEN: I don't know, Zander.
ZANDER: I do.
JOHNNY: Dizzy bought the farm. She was my good friend, and friens are the best luck anyone gets. But in war, we must go on without our friends. We take with us their memory, and we are left to wonder if there is meaning in their death. Let me tell you what it is: Dizzy bough the farm so we can keep on fighting. Several INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS march into the bay.
JOHNNY: Officer on deck ! Everyone snaps to attention. Colonel Carl Jenkins strides into the room. His eyes are hollow, and he looks grim. He returns Johnny's salute, nods to Carmen.
CARL: Please continue, Sergeant.
JOHNNY: Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her. with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death. Johnny nods to the GUNNERY CREW. They load Dizzy's body into a tube. Johnny steps back, salutes Dizzy. Everyone salutes.
JOHNNY: Womb to tomb, cap trooper !
ROUGHNECKS: Womb to tomb ! The CREW CHIEF fires the tube. Out the viewports, A PULSE OF LIGHT disperses into space. The Roughnecks file out. Carl approaches. Carmen takes Johnny and Carl by the hand.
CARMEN: Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
JOHNNY: How are you, Carl ?
CARL: Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability.
JOHNNY: Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
CARL: Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
CARMEN: You knew and you sent them anyway ?
CARL: A colony has to reach a certain size before it produces a Brain. we think 300 generations. Woulda too expensive to launch an operation if there wasn't a Carl sees the way Carmen is looking at him, like he's a bug.
CARL: You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
JOHNNY: Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good Carl allows himself a tiny smile.
CARL: Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
JOHNNY: The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
CARL: I hear they need a new Lieutenant. Want the job ?
JOHNNY: I'll take it. until I get killed or you find someone better. KLAXONS sound. Suddenly, everyone has someplace to go.
CARMEN: Hope you get your Brain Bug, Carl.
CARL: It's good to see you two. It reminds me of the way things were before. Carl turns abruptly and heads away. His entourage follows.
CARMEN: Take care, wilya Johnny ?
JOHNNY: See you on the bounce !
CARMEN: Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
DELADIER: He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go. He said you'd understand. Carmen bites her lip, takes first chair. Deladier feels bad for her, knows she's made a painful decision.
ACE: Officer on the deck ! Roughnecks fall in. Johnny steps into the room. There are many new and much younger faces.
JOHNNY: I only have two rules. Rule one, everyone fights. Rule two, no one quits. If you don't do your job, I'll kill you myself. Do you get me ?
ROUGHNECKS: We get you, sir !
JOHNNY: ( to Ace, sotto voce ) Who're all these kids ?
ACE: We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot.
JOHNNY: We're the old men, Ace.
JOHNNY: We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
ACE: Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
JOHNNY: Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet. Roughnecks boo.
JOHNNY: Alright, cut it out. We will deploy from skimmers in teams of six. If the bugs open up a battery, we put it out of business. Any questions ? A HERCULES CARGO BOAT hurtles out of the sky and lands on the high ground Johnny has intended forb his H.Q. Johnny scowls, marches over to the boat and confronts a FLEET OFFICER.
JOHNNY: Would'ya mind moving your boat ?
FLEET OFFICER: Better talk to the boss. The cargo bays open to deploy FLEET SKIMMERS. Zander jumps down to oversee the operation.
JOHNNY: You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
ZANDER: This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
JOHNNY: You heard the Sky Marshall. Move it all down - Suddenly, in the distance, bug batteries open fire, not one but twenty. Zander and Johnny share a look of concern.
ZANDER: Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire.! I'll take the first group.
JOHNNY: Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
DELADIER: Evasive action ! Carmen dodges other starships, turns to her new number 2.
CARMEN: Prepare for warp !
CARMEN: This is Rodger Young, we're going down. Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down.!
DELADIER: Ibanez.LET'S GO !
DELADIER: AAAAAAAAAAA ! Carmen hits the release, pulls her free. Deladier pushes Carmen away.
AAAAAAAAAAA !: Carmen hits the release, pulls her free. Deladier pushes Carmen away.
DELADIER: Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
CARMEN: No way, ma'am !
CARMEN: Mayday, mayday ! This is Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez in lifepod RY63. I'm going in.
JOHNNY: What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
ZANDER: The Rodger Young just burned up. Johnny's face falls.
JOHNNY: Any survivors ? Zander points. Far in the distance, a glowing pod plummets toward the planet. Johnny tracks it on his "head up".
CARMEN: This is Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez. Is anyone receiving ?
CARMEN: My present location is 42 degrees South by 176 degrees East. situation is extremely hostile.
I.AAAAAAAAA !: They have her. She puts the barrel of the Morita in her mouth, but a claw cut her trigger finger off at the knuckle.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !: We've gotta go get her !
JOHNNY: We've gotta go get her !
ZANDER: You know as well as I do she's probably already dead. Johnny knows it's true, swallows bitterly, turns away. That's when he sees it. Nearby, the ground shifts, a claw breaks through, a hole opens up and bugs boil up out of the ground.
SUGAR WATKINS: Here they come ! They turn and see a second bug hole open up.
JOHNNY: We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
ZANDER: Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here- The entire area underneath the base camp collapses to form a huge new canyon. The Hercules boat topples, crushing Skimmers and unfortunate Fleet personnnel.
JOHNNY: Form a perimeter ! Through the dust, exposed bug tunnels can be seen in the canyon walls and piling out of them by the score, deadly Arachnid warriors. Johnny throws Zander a pulse cannon.
JOHNNY: Make yourself useful, fly boy.
ZANDER: AAAAAAAAAAA ! Johnny and Ace team up to blow it away. Zander takes a deep breath, loos around, impressed. The Roughnecks have killed a great many bugs.
AAAAAAAAAAA !: Johnny and Ace team up to blow it away. Zander takes a deep breath, loos around, impressed. The Roughnecks have killed a great many bugs.
JOHNNY: Ace, get on the com. Tell Fleet we need retrieval. Sugar, salvage some armor and suit up Lieutenant Barcalow. Sugar Watkins tosses a bloody jump boot his way.
ZANDER: Fleet Command says retrieval's no go. The battle group's at safe distance. and we got another problem. Ace points out a Tanker bug that's been brough up to the rim. Johnny sees another.
ACE: Fleet Command says retrieval's no go. The battle group's at safe distance. and we got another problem. Ace points out a Tanker bug that's been brough up to the rim. Johnny sees another.
JOHNNY: Looks like they're gonna hose us down. Johnny chews on this.
JOHNNY: Alright. Listen up, Roughnecks. We're gonna head west down through bug city, pick up any Rodger Young survivors we run across, and join A Company. Get me ?
ROUGHNECKS: We get you, sir ! Zander, awkward in a power suit, confronts Johnny.
ZANDER: What do you think you're doing ?
JOHNNY: I'm gonna save Carmen.
ZANDER: That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
JOHNNY: Yeah, that's right. Johnny and Zander stare each other down.
ZANDER: Let's go.
JOHNNY: Move out. Johnny starts for the gaping mouth of an exposed bug tunnel and the others fall in behind him.
ACE: Bug hunt !
ROUGHNECKS: BUG HUNT ! 172 INT TUNNEL - DAY - JOHNNY leads his deadly force through enemy territory. The Roughnecks kill everything that gets in their way. Zander lends his inexperienced hand.
JOHNNY: Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers. Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our Yes, sir ! Warriors appear in the tunnel behind them.
ACE: Yes, sir ! Warriors appear in the tunnel behind them.
JOHNNY: Sugar, close the tunnel.!
SUGAR: Fire in the hole ! Sugar Watkins fires an H.E. round and seals the tunnel.
DELADIER: NAAAAAAAA.! OH PLEASE. The BRAIN BUG is huge ( 5 meters ) and pulpy. I has vestigial legs that cannot support ist weight, and so it must be moved by a shifting carpet of chariot bugs.
DELADIER: .OH GOD AAAAAAAAAAAAA.! A thorn-like PALP unfolds out of the brain bug and strikes, driving deep into Deladier's head and sucks her brains out.
DELADIER: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Carmen watches horrified as Deladier dies. The suddenly a warrior grabs her from above and drags her out of the pit. She screams as its claws slice into her limbs.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !: Carmen watches horrified as Deladier dies. The suddenly a warrior grabs her from above and drags her out of the pit. She screams as its claws slice into her limbs.
CARMEN: AAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Now the brain bug comes for her. She sees the palp unfold, the thorn-like spike coming toward her. Carmen is no longer looking for escape. All she wants to do is die. Suddenly, every bug in the chamber stops as though to listen. Carmen hears it. A HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL, getting louder. Johnny enters the chamber alone. The warriors move toward him. He holds up a NUKE, source of the high-pitched tone. The ready light flashes. The Brain Bug emits a series of harsh clicks. The warriors freeze.

He holds up a NUKE, source of the high-pitched tone. The ready light flashes. The Brain Bug emits a series of harsh clicks. The warriors freeze.
JOHNNY: You know what this is.? Johnny makes an explosive sound. The Brain Bug slowly withdraws its palp.
JOHNNY: Sure you do. You're a big fat smart bug, aren't you ? Johnny moves toward Carmen. The Brain Bug's multiple eyes track him. The warriors holding Carmen threaten. Johnny turns on the brain bug, his finger on the nuke's trigger.
JOHNNY: I'll take you with me. The Brain Bug clicks. The warriors back off. Carmen collapses. Johnny reaches for her.
JOHNNY: Take my hand ! Chariot bugs move the Brain Bug down a hole. Workers seal the hole behind it with amazing speed. Johnny drags Carmen back toward the tunnel he entered from. The warriors charge.
JOHNNY: Roughnecks.NOW ! Johnny throws himself on top of Carmen as the Roughnecks burst into the chamber, guns blazing. The fight is furious, point blank, deadly to bug and Roughneck alike. Sugar Watkins screams as a warrior rips his arm off. Zander takes a claw through the gut.
ZANDER: AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! He blows it away, sees his intestines hanging out of the wound, shoves them back inside and keeps on fighting. A warrior rears up over Johnny and Carmen.
AAAAAAAAAAAAA !: He blows it away, sees his intestines hanging out of the wound, shoves them back inside and keeps on fighting. A warrior rears up over Johnny and Carmen.
JOHNNY: Weapon ! Ace throws him a Morita. Johnny catches it, pumps three rounds into the bug's nerve stem. He struggles out from under the dead warrior. Every bug in the chamber is dead.
JOHNNY: Are you hurt ? Carmen throws her arms around Johnny.
CARMEN: Zander takes this in. Carmen sees him, then his wound.
CARMEN: Zander.! Oh, you're hurt. Ace takes a look at his wound, makes a face.
ACE: Ah geez. Zander pushes him away, struggles to his feet.
JOHNNY: Can you walk ?
ZANDER: ( clenched teeth ) Not a problem.
JOHNNY: Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole ! Various components are gladly passed forward. Johnny and Ace help her putting it on.
CARMEN: I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
ZANDER: It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you.
CARMEN: Is it true ?
JOHNNY: Yeah, if I live through this, they'll probably hang me. Now com'on, let's move out !
CARMEN: Which way ?
JOHNNY: Up. We gotta be near A Company by now. The tunnel floor drops out. FIVE ROUGHNECKS disappear into the hole. WARRIORS climb up into the tunnel.
JOHNNY: FALL BACK ! The Roughnecks bachk up fast, shooting. Zander staggers, collapses. Johnny drops to his side, rolls him over.
JOHNNY: How bad are you, pal ?
ZANDER: Been better, buddy. Johnny sees warriors coming up into the tunnel by the score.
JOHNNY: Alright, we're gonna carry you.
ZANDER: Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late. Gimmee the nuke. Zander checks his pulse cannon's available power.
JOHNNY: Don't be a hero.
ZANDER: This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of Johnny nods, hands him the nuke. Carmen sees what's happening.
CARMEN: Zander, what are you doing ?
ZANDER: Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
CARMEN: Zander, no.! He grabs her and kisses her. Johnny drags Carmen away. Zander opens fire as the first warriors reach his position.
JOHNNY: GO.GO GO GO GO.! Tears stream down from Carmen's face.
CARMEN: Look. they got it. Several of its delicate legs were apparently broken during the capture. Carl approaches it without fear, puts his hand on the thing.
GENERAL: What's it thinking, Colonel ? Carl smiles in a cruel way.
CARL: It's afraid. Johnny and Carmen approach the General.
JOHNNY: Sir, I'd like to turn myself in. Dereliction of duty by an officer during wartime.
GENERAL: And you freely admit to it ?
JOHNNY: Yes, sir.
GENERAL: Is what this man says true, Lieutenant ?
CARMEN: To the best of my understanding, Writers : Robert A. Heinlein Edward Neumeier
