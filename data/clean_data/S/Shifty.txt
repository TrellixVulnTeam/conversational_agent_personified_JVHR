73A: INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY Shifty enters. The CAMERA follows. We're introduced to a dark hallway, clothes, magazines and CD's litter the floor. Shifty peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway - a mattress with no sheets. Shifty carries on down the hallway. Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal a grotty front room. On the TV a violent movie scene plays out, the sound turned down. A wiry looking 18 year old, Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the films images. A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left. Shifty, cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to the stereo, and turns it off. The young kid sits there, just staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed. Shifty stares him out.
SHIFTY: Alright mate?
OTIS: Shifty looks about at the room.
SHIFTY: What's your name?
OTIS: A BEAT.
SHIFTY: Where do you get your weed from?
OTIS: It aint. it aint mine, my erm, my mate left it, he left it here. I could phone him if you want, he'll sort you out.

SHIFTY: I'm gonna sell you your weed half price, and your gonna keep this noise down.
YEAH?: At that moment Otis and his girlfriend look up to see Chris standing in the doorway. His presence adds menace to the
OTIS: Yeah, alright, yeah.
SHIFTY: Because if I hear one word of complaint from next door, just one single complaint, I'll come back here and I'll take your TV, I'll take your stereo, and I'll shove em up your birds arse.
OTIS: Yeah, yeah, it's cool, I'm sorry, man, I didn't know I had it on loud, I would have turned it down, I'm sorry. Call me if you need any more weed.
SHIFTY: Call me if you need any more weed.
