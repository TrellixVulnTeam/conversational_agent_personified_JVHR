SARA'S FACE: distant and lovely and sad. SUPERIMPOSED against an endless stream of sky and trees. The train speeds up and SARA's face flies by, disappearing FROM FRAME.

SARA: Swim? You can't swim, Mom.
GLYNN: I'll float then. Hey. Happy Valentine's Day.
GLYNN: Hey. Happy Valentine's Day.
MOMENTS LATER: Sara on stage. She looks past a row of Juilliard JUDGES into the audience. No glint of gold. MOZART'S "Elvira Madigan" ( Andante ) CUES UP. Sara begins her technical. She transforms her nervousness into a notable, powerful performance. The Judges are mutely but clearly impressed. One of them looks directly at her.
JUDGE: Is there anything you'd like to share about your free form before you begin? A motif. a theme? Well, it's um, pretty self- explanatory. The theme.
SARA: Well, it's um, pretty self- explanatory. The theme.

SARA: Two suitcases. One big one.
ROY: Looks like they're unloading. You hungry? We can stop somewhere if you want.

ROY: I didn't like leavin' you so soon after the funeral. I wouldn't have if you hadn't asked me to go. I mean, I could've hung around. Helped you say good-bye. That's what you were doin', wasn't it?
SARA: Roy takes another drag, nods thoughtfully to himself.
ROY: That's what I figured you were
ROY: Look. Sara. I feel bad too. I mean, we both got hit by the same bolt of lightning. You don't have to pretend this is easy. Everything's upside down right now but don't worry. We'll work this bachelor-father thing out. Hell, it ain't like we're movin' in with strangers. We got a pretty good idea about each other, right?
SARA: Thought you were moving to Fells Fell through.
ROY: Fell through.
ROY: Not much of what you're used to. But the water's hot and the fridge is full. And I made room in the closets for you. Girl's gotta have closets, right? You even get your own bed. I'll crash on the You bought a bed?
SARA: You bought a bed?
ROY: ( slight bow ) Pardon me. Your own futon. Check it out. On the other side.
SARA: Do you have a phone?
ROY: Of course I have a phone.
SARA: You didn't at the last place. The last place I saw anyway.
ROY: Things change. You've changed. You grew up on me. Overnight.
SARA: Over the summer. You blew me off for some gig on the road, Can I call Lindsay? Let her know I got here alright.
ROY: Are you alright, Sara? I just wanna know how you feel.
SARA: I feel fine. I feel like calling She's a wall. A brick wall. Roy's head aches from knocking into it. He goes to the couch. Drops down. Mutters at her.
ROY: Phone's in the kitchen. Knock yourself out.
NEXT MORNING: Roy and Sara. Barreling through the south end, tongues stuck in gear. A Pop-Tart grows cold on Sara's lap. Then, finally.
SARA: I can take the school bus. School bus? That's the other Oz, Dorothy. Patterson kids ride the city Metro. Or walk.
ROY: School bus? That's the other Oz, Dorothy. Patterson kids ride the city Metro. Or walk.

SARA: I don't think I'll have time. I have to study, I'll be busy.
ROY: Good idea. Take a break. Not too long a break though. You're a dancer. You should dance. Stay on top of your art.
SARA: Like you stay on top of yours?
ROY: Maybe I ain't playin' no grand ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals, but I'm playing.
SARA: ( unconvincingly ) I didn't mean it like that.
ROY: S'alright. Hell, I wish I had half the time I wasted gettin' wasted. But those days are over. You'll see. I got my life on
SARA: You don't have to go in with me. Since I'm all set. I mean, I have done this before. Gone to school. I'll be fine. I am fine. Really.

MRS. GWYNN: Any questions? Concerns?
SARA: About school? No. Not really.
MRS. GWYNN: Not even about Baltimore?
SARA: I'm not gonna be here that long. Besides, it's just a city, right?
SARA'S POV: as she MOVES FORWARD. A crush of KIDS mostly black with a sprinkling of white and Latino faces thrown in. Kids like her. Only they don't dress like her. They dress like commercials for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. And they definitely don't sound like her.
TEENAGER #1: Yo, man, check it, the muthafuckers wasn't playin', they was jackin'. Ten rides in five days. For real.
TEENAGER #2: Fools got caught for real too. Ten years in five days. Stall that shit!
CHENILLE: That's how easy it is to give to charity around here. Don't put your shit on the floor.
SARA: ( cautions a smile )
JURASINSKI: In Cold Blood represents a turning point in our country's literature. Take the cap off and tell me why that is, Mr. Ricard. Gay rights. That Compote dude who wrote it? Sweet tooth. Straight- up fag, Mr. J.
SNOOKIE: Gay rights. That Compote dude who wrote it? Sweet tooth. Straight- up fag, Mr. J.
JURASINSKI: Thank you, Mr. Ricard. Your genius grant is in the mail. Anyone else?
JURASINSKI: Ms. Johnson. You can catch up later. If this is over your head.
SARA: It's a non-fiction novel. The first of its kind. Capote mixed true events with things he couldn't know, so he made them up. White folks back then felt safe. Capote scared 'em. He took hard core crime out the ghetto and dropped it in America's back yard. That's what makes the book Yeah. That is part of it.
SARA: Yeah. That is part of it.
PATRICK: That's all of it. Capote wasn't first. Richard Wright and James Baldwin did the same thing. Wasn't nobody tryin' to read them
SARA: Lots of people read them.
PATRICK: Lots of people like who? You? Hello. Didn't think so.
SNOOKIE: Mr. J.! Girl needs to bone up. Give her a pass to the lib'ary.
ON SARA: flushed in the face. Embarrassed. Pissed. ANGLE WIDENS as Jurasinski quiets the class. Then.
JURASINSKI: She can have your pass, Mr. Ricard. Since you obviously never use it.
HER POV: Table cliques of the cafeteria.
ON CHENILLE: glimpsing Sara from the corner of her eye as Sara walks 53 AT NERDS' TABLE - LATER 53 Time has passed. The cafeteria is half as full, half as noisy. Sara sits among the NERDS, a friendly if verbose group. She's trying to eat but a snooze button is talking her to death.
WONK: . I know you're new to the table, but think about it. We're the Y2K generation and nobody takes us seriously. We don't take ourselves seriously. Just look around. Half the student body is D.O.A. and that's from the neck up, Clara.
SARA: Sara. It's Sara.
CHENILLE: You finished? God! Thank you!
SARA: God! Thank you!
CHENILLE: ( laughs ) Gotta watch where you sit, girl. And it's Chenille. But you're still welcome. Let's catch some air before the bell rings.

CHENILLE: A dance.
SARA: ( a look; knows that ) No, I mean. the step, the.
PATRICK: playing cards with Snookie at one of the picnic tables. He glances up to see Sara. Glowering at him. He grins. Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Mutters loudly to 54 CONTINUED: 54
SARA: ( CONTINUED )
CHENILLE: Asshole beaucoup. In this crowd, you gotta be more specific.

That was harsh, way she canceled your ass like a stamp for that Howard U dude. But their shit's over. Now might be the time to forget mistakes that was made. Shoot. You been with the girl since ninth
PATRICK: Why you sweatin' me, Snookie?
SNOOKIE: ( pounding his heart ) 'Cause I'm about you, man. I want a happy ending. Aww, shit. Tuck an' duck. Here he comes. The hood of the 'hood, up to no good.
THEIR POV: MALAKAI RHINEHART, 17, heading toward them. Powerfully built and edgy with insolence, Malakai is like a tightly- wound coil you never know when he's going to snap. ANGLE WIDENS and we see Patrick is happy to see him. He and Malakai grin at each other. Knock handshakes.
MALAKAI: Medicine man.
SNOOKIE: ( interjecting himself ) Did I tell you, Malakai, man, how chill it is to have you back? We ain't been bad without cha.
MALAKAI: Shut the fuck up and step your lame ass off, Snookie. You heard me. Space.
PATRICK: What happened to you at lunch,
MALAKAI: Short-hand. Patrick understands it, nods. Malakai slips the cigarette from behind his ear, openly lights and starts smoking it. CAMERA TRACKS them walking back toward Patterson.
PATRICK: So you're hangin' in, man? Feelin' strong about being back?
MALAKAI: Not at this motherfucker. Out a week and where am I? Fucking home sweet high school. Jail away from jail. You can have it.
PATRICK: You gonna stay though. Right?
MALAKAI: Judge says it's school or JuVee and I sure as hell ain't goin' back there. Shit. I never knew a year could be such a long time.
PATRICK: You up for some hoops after school? Break your free-throw back in. Chump the chumps like we used to.
MALAKAI: Up for it? Hell-the-fuck yeah, man. Let's do it.
CHENILLE: That's your old man? Now he's He's embarrassing.
SARA: He's embarrassing.
CHENILLE: ( laughs ) Yeah. He is. For you.
ROY: How'd it go?
SARA: ( as he pulls off ) Tomorrow I catch the bus.
SARA: ROY ( O.S. )
ROY: Hungry and Healthys. I asked at the market. They're the best. So. What do you feel like? Lamb Chop Suey? Tropical Tuna? Primavera Paradise?
SARA: I had a big lunch.
ROY: What do you wanna do? You wanna hang out with me? Go to my gig. You can if you want.
SARA: It's a school night, Roy.
ROY: Right. School night. Got it.
MORNING: Patrick, Chenille, Snookie straggle through the dreary jungle of concrete lawns and blighted high rises on the way to school. It's quiet now but the scars of past battles, like the bombed out police substation on one of its corners, are evident everywhere.
SNOOKIE: I need a date
CHENILLE: Why? Your hand busy?
SNOOKIE: For the prom. And if it wasn't for that kinda undue attitude, you could be the lucky girl, Chenille. My personal prom queen. I can see us now.
CHENILLE: You must be lookin' in your
SNOOKIE: Help me, man. Defend me.
PATRICK: I got my own problems, Snook.
SNOOKIE: What problems? You goin' to college. Doctor college after that. You large, man.
PATRICK: I ain't gonna be doctor nothin' if I don't get in and I'm not in 'til I get my letter.
CHENILLE: It's in the mail, Patrick. Okay?
SNOOKIE: ( wishfully thinking ) I probably coulda been a doctor too. If I hadn't got left back that time.
CHENILLE: That time? What? Fifth and sixth grade don't count?
CONTINUOUS ACTION: Patrick and Chenille pass through metal detectors, watch Snookie clown his way through. The security guard shakes his head. All three begin to walk. Snookie, bobbing and jiving, doesn't see Mrs. Gwynn coming up from behind. Her voice stops him cold.
MRS. GWYNN: ( as Patrick and Light on your feet? Good. Be sure they dance into my office next week.
MR. HILL: We're cooking today, Ms. Johnson. This is your first lab. You'll need a partner. Mr. Reynolds Patrick will show you the
PATRICK: ( very casually ) That's too big.
SARA: I know it's too big.
PATRICK: I wouldn't do that if I were you.
SARA: ( yanks her hand back ) Who died and made you teacher?
PATRICK: Know the difference between ethyl glycol and methyl acetate? Both got three elements, two parts the same. It's that first part, C2 versus C3. C3 could blow a vial right out a person's hand. Sara thinks he's messing with her. But then the contents of the beaker begin to ominously bubble. Panicked, she drops the vial into their sink. It instantly goes up in smoke. Some of the liquid splashes on Sara's lab coat. Patrick grabs a wet towel, quickly wipes it off. The class stops cold. Hill rushes up to them. Once he's sure Sara's fine, he looks sternly at Patrick.
MR. HILL: What happened? Everybody back in your seats! Patrick stares at Sara. Her face is red. She's biting her lip.
PATRICK: I misread the component.
MR. HILL: ( even more angry now ) You? You misread a component. Don't give me that, Patrick. You were screwin' around!
CHENILLE: Girl, how you get your legs to twist like that?
DIGGY: ( wildly gesticulating ) Yeah. What was all that double- jointed cheerleader shit?
CHENILLE: This is Diggy. Thinks she's down.
DIGGY: Egg-cuse me? I am down.
CHENILLE: So, Sara. What's up with that?
SARA: ( awkwardly ) Nothing's up with it. I used to kind of dance. Ballet. Mostly. You should hit Feetz with us tomorrow night. It's a club. Sorta members only.
CHENILLE: You should hit Feetz with us tomorrow night. It's a club. Sorta members only.
DIGGY: I don't know.
SARA: I don't know.
CHENILLE: Come on and hang out. Snook dee's sometime. He can get you in. Yo, Snook Sara sees Snookie. then Patrick. loping her way. She steels herself. He's going to say something, crack some joke about her nearly blowing him up. But Patrick just stares at her with a twinkle in his eyes. A nice twinkle. Sara's not entirely immune to it. Chenille breaks their eye play, pushes Patrick aside. She grabs Snookie's arm, indicates Sara.
CHENILLE: She needs to get hooked up for Feetz. All the way up. Sara, give Snook twenty dollars.
SARA: For what?
SNOOKIE: I.D. Eye-dee. How you think you gettin' in? On your looks? Chenille, your girl is weak. Shit. I got my rep to watch. I can't just be gettin' any green
SARA: Look closer. And if I still look green, I think maybe you should wipe the crust from your eyes. You gonna pay the man or what?
CHENILLE: You gonna pay the man or what?
SNOOKIE: She ain't got it. Look at her. Loud-talkin' me and broke as a damn promise.
SARA: I don't even know where it is.
CHENILLE: So we'll hook up at my house. Go together. I will have your I.D. Feetz ain't no square dance.
PATRICK: Feetz ain't no square dance.
SARA: That's okay. I dance in circles. Probably around you.
ROY: I'm splittin'. Whatcha readin'?
SARA: You're takin' chemistry?
ROY: You're takin' chemistry?
SARA: Right now it's taking me.
ROY: Give yourself some time. Well. See ya in the mornin'. Maybe I'll call between sets. I'll be asleep.
SARA: I'll be asleep.
SARA: Cool outfit.

CHENILLE: Yeah. You look okay. Moma Dean. I'm leavin'.
CHENILLE: ( fussing over Grandmom, Sara. Sara, Grandmom. Also known as Momma Dean. And handsome here is Christopher.
SARA: MOMMA DEAN
MOMMA DEAN: Hello. Now don't get him all riled up, Chenille. I want to get some sleep tonight.
SARA: Is that. is he. yours?
CHENILLE: He sure ain't Momma Dean's.
CHENILLE: . He'll be one in July. Best mistake I ever made. Kenny Christopher's father he's the worst. Triflin'. Okay?
SARA: Chenille. She's ugly. She's fat!
CHENILLE: She's twenty-one too. I ain't got all night. Let's hop.
SARA: Wait. I have to ask you Do I really look alright? An unspoken thing passes between them. Chenille suddenly whips off her coat. Gestures at Sara with her head.
CHENILLE: Gimme that '89 Madonna shit. Your jacket. Give it here.
SARA: It's from the GAP.
CHENILLE: It's country. You look country in it. Take it off.
SARA: I'm not walking in there in my

DOORMAN: Chenille. Lookin' fine. As Too fine to stand in line?
CHENILLE: Too fine to stand in line?
BOUNCER: Changed your hair.
SARA: ( an inside to Chenille ) Can't get much more underground than this.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Sara and Chenille. Sara's excited. She loves that she has to shout to be head over the music.
CHENILLE: Let's get our table 'fore it gets crashed and I hafta hurt somebody.
SARA: What are you, some kind of V.I.P.?
CHENILLE: Snook hooks me up whenever he

CHENILLE: Yeah. And they started with you.
NIKKI: I'm Nikki. Alyssa. Jasmin. Tiff'nee. You know Diggy, right, Sara. It's Sara. And I know you. We have a class together.
SARA: Sara. It's Sara. And I know you. We have a class together.
NIKKI: That don't mean you know me.
CHENILLE: Quit it, Nikki.
NIKKI: Quit what? I ain't walkin' on eggshells just 'cause you brought the Brady Bunch to the Negro Club.
SARA: ( kiss-my-ass polite ) Maybe you came to the wrong spot, Nikki. I'm pretty sure this one doesn't have any Negroes.
NIKKI: I'm pretty sure you came with one.
CHENILLE: Oh, no. Uh-uh, wench. You did not just call me a Negro. Alright, y'all. Chill.
DIGGY: Alright, y'all. Chill.
NIKKI: Tell her to chill. She always got somethin' to say.
CHENILLE: I can say a lot more. Keep runnin' your mouth, Nikki. I'll lay all your shit bare. Whatever shit it is, Nikki's not taking any chances. She ejects herself from the table, walks off. The three girls scoot loyally after her. Diggy gets up. Sits down at Sara's and Chenille's table. Diggy goes with the flow. That's why she always fits in.
DIGGY: Why you burn her like that?
CHENILLE: 'Cause I can't stand her ass and the way she played my brother. I need a drink, Sara. Let's walk.
CHENILLE: That's him. Comin' over. Kenny? Don't look. So of course Sara does. She makes a silly face at Chenille as Kenny sidles up to her. Chenille rolls her eyes half-heartedly.
CHENILLE: Where's my money, Kenny?
KENNY: I'm a little short this week. Don't jump off. It's comin'.
CHENILLE: It's comin'? No. You lyin'.
KENNY: Lemme rap to you about the situation on the dance floor.
CHENILLE: Rum and Coke. No ice. Hook me
ON PATRICK: splitting off from Malakai and a girl clinging to him. He's walking through when Nikki appears from nowhere, grabs his arm.
NIKKI: Let's dance.
PATRICK: ( pulling away ) Let's not.
NIKKI: Oh? It's gonna be like that.
PATRICK: How'd you think it was gonna be? That you was gonna drop me and pick me up whenever you felt like It ain't all that serious, It ain't anymore, Nikki. Not to Rum and Coke, straight up. And a beer. I don't care. Anything.
NIKKI: It ain't all that serious, It ain't anymore, Nikki. Not to Rum and Coke, straight up. And a beer. I don't care. Anything.
PATRICK: It ain't anymore, Nikki. Not to Rum and Coke, straight up. And a beer. I don't care. Anything.
SARA: Rum and Coke, straight up. And a beer. I don't care. Anything.
SARA: It's just a beer.
PATRICK: Then it should be the best beer. You'd know that if you really
SARA: What's that mean? Whatever.
PATRICK: What's that mean? Whatever.
SARA: Whatever you want it to mean. You're the whiz kid, right? You know everything.
PATRICK: ( chuckles at this, at Not everything. Like I don't know why we're standin' still. ( closer with a teasing I'm supposed to be dizzy by now. Remember? From all those circles you danced around me.
SARA: I don't feel like dancing.
PATRICK: But you do know how.?
SARA: Would I be here if I didn't?
PATRICK: . Let's do it then. C'mon. Now move your hips. Not so fast. Sara! Just like our hands. 'Flashlight! Neon light! Stop light! Everybody got a little light under the sun.'
PATRICK: Now move your hips. Not so fast. Sara! Just like our hands. 'Flashlight! Neon light! Stop light! Everybody got a little light under the sun.'
JASMIN: She's all up in your nut, Nikki. Oh, that's right. It ain't your nut anymore.
NIKKI: It is if I want it to be. He is if I want him to be. That bitch ain't got shit on me.
ON PATRICK: leaving Sara, slicing through a clot of looky-loos until he reaches Malakai. He jumps into the fray.
PATRICK: pummeling his dealer into cowering submission. Only then does he look over at Malakai who, eyes engorged with rage, is standing over his opponent, kicking and stomping him with no signs of letting up. Patrick can see Malakai's too far gone for talk. He rushes him from behind, nearly lifts Malakai off his feet to swing him away from the dealer's writhing body on the floor.
PATRICK: Man, what the hell are you doin'? Tryin' to get sent back up?
MALAKAI: They the ones tryin' shit. Comin' here. Squarin' off in my shit.
PATRICK: You couldn't let it slide?
MALAKAI: Let it slide tonight, they come back strong tomorrow. You know Malakai, you fuck up parole, you ain't gonna back to JuVee. Eighteen and up, that's Jessup. Hardcore lockdown. You want that?
PATRICK: Malakai, you fuck up parole, you ain't gonna back to JuVee. Eighteen and up, that's Jessup. Hardcore lockdown. You want that?
MALAKAI: ( regards him coldly ) I want what was mine. Feetz is my spot. I'ma do business here just like I did before. Like we did before. And if I gotta stomp some niggers in my way, so be it. Well, you definitely got the stompin' part down.
PATRICK: Well, you definitely got the stompin' part down.
MALAKAI: We fucked those fools up for sure.
PATRICK: ( crossing to exit door ) For damn sure, man.
DIGGY: It's about to get real out here. Cops and shit. I'm gone.
CHENILLE: . Yeah, I'ma tell you. Tell you like I keep tellin' you, Patrick. You need to let Malakai alone. Let him handle his own shit before he drags you down in it.
PATRICK: Chenille. I heard you the first five hundred times.
CHENILLE: I'll see you Monday. He'll walk you.
SARA: It's just a few blocks. It's No, it's not okay. Would you tell the girl it ain't okay?
CHENILLE: No, it's not okay. Would you tell the girl it ain't okay?
PATRICK: It's not okay, okay? Come on, Braveheart.
PATRICK: ( caught ) Why you keep lookin' at me?
SARA: ( caught ) Why you keep lookin' at me?
PATRICK: Why you keep lookin' at me?
SARA: I have to look somewhere. The streets are deserted. Might as well look at you.
PATRICK: That's not why. You wanna know somethin'. Ask somethin'.
SARA: It's not a question. It's the way you were beating that kid up. You looked so mad.
PATRICK: I was mad and he wasn't no kid. But you're from the suburb Mars, right? Folks don't fight there.
SARA: Not like that. You were really kicking his ass. Are you laughing at me? My friend was in trouble.
SARA: Are you laughing at me? My friend was in trouble.
PATRICK: My friend was in trouble.
SARA: Maybe he's my question. Your friend. Chenille doesn't like
PATRICK: She likes him. It don't stop her from trippin' off him now and then. But Malakai's good people. We go back. Way back. You know, like they say, through thick and So, how'd you like Feetz?
SARA: It was great.
PATRICK: Once you got used to the music.
SARA: It wasn't the music I wasn't used to. I mean, it's not the first time I heard hip-hop, Patrick.
PATRICK: Uh-huh. Bet you listen to it all the time.
SARA: Not all the time. But a lot.

SARA: Thanks for walking me.
PATRICK: No problem.
SARA: So. I'll see ya.
PATRICK: Is that 'see ya' like gee-whiz, had a great time, can't wait to see you again?
SARA: I haven't said gee-whiz since I was six. But I really had a great time. okay?
PATRICK: She enters the rowhouse. Patrick waits until the lights go on inside before he turns around and starts home.
ROY: Figured I'd put a little marrow in your bones. Siddown, siddown. You gettin' along at school? Makin' friends.? . See any of 'em last night? I came home on my break.
ROY: I came home on my break.
SARA: The succinct sneer in her voice gets to Roy. He snaps at

ON SARA: What are you doing?
SARA: What are you doing?
MALAKAI: You didn't see nothin', you don't say nothin'. Not unless you want a taste for yourself. And that can be arranged.

SARA: Let me finish. Me and him got into some shit awhile back. Real bad shit. We held up a gas station off 95. I bailed the ride jumped out the car. 'Kai kept goin', got caught. I knew what he was gonna do that night. Knew the car was hot. I woulda been guilty as him if they had caught me, if Malakai had served my name up. But he didn't.

SARA: That means you owe him something?
PATRICK: He did his time plus most of mine. I owe him that.
SARA: No matter how much he messes up?
PATRICK: We all mess up. Maybe Malakai gave up. But he's still m'boy and he still got a chance. I ain't just gonna cross him completely off and be like everybody else.
SARA: I stole a hat once. When I was twelve. My mom found it under my mattress, made me take it back.

PATRICK: I thought you would like it.
SARA: I did.
PATRICK: You ain't actin' like you did.
SARA: I'm sorry.
SARA: I don't want you to think I didn't have a good time tonight, Patrick. I did. But ballet isn't a part of my life anymore.
PATRICK: Why not? What happened? You just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent.
SARA: ( without rancor ) How do you know I have talent? Because I did some stupid leg I saw the look on your face when you did it, Sara. The same look I saw tonight. Goofy happy. So if you're gonna tell me somethin' about not dancing, at least tell me somethin' real.
PATRICK: I saw the look on your face when you did it, Sara. The same look I saw tonight. Goofy happy. So if you're gonna tell me somethin' about not dancing, at least tell me somethin' real.
SARA: Maybe I don't want it to be real.
SARA: What I want is to wake up and see my mom. For things to go back to the way they were. When they made sense. When my life made sense. And it's all my fault. She got scraped off the highway for me, for my fucking audition. She was rushing. It was raining. It was . But she promised to be there. I made her promise. And then I didn't wait for her. I should have but they called my name and I didn't say anything. I just went out and danced. I was mad. I needed her and she wasn't there.
SARA: ( inconsolable ) She was dying while I was dancing and I was mad at her and I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
PATRICK: It's not your fault it rained or she died. Or that you danced. That's what you were there for. Your mom would've expected you to do what you did.
SARA: That's what makes it so bad. She always did what was right for me. I wanted to be a prima ballerina had to be. Even if it took most of our money, all of her spare time. I didn't care. It was my stupid dream and it killed her. All she wanted was for it to come true.
PATRICK: You still got whatever you had when your mom was alive, Sara. She wouldn't want you to give up.
SARA: I know. but she. I just don't think I can do it without her.
PATRICK: ( holding her ) Do you want to do it, Sara? I mean you. Do you want Juilliard?
SARA: Yeah. I do.
PATRICK: Then it's on you to make the dream come true.
SARA: Yeah. For my mom.
PATRICK: For her. For you.
SARA: See you tomorrow?
PATRICK: Lemme see that move you did. That cute leg relieve thing. Come on, Sara.

SARA: This is the perfect spot for that. You can run around and I can sit under the trees and watch you.
PATRICK: This is the perfect spot for that. You can run around and I can sit under the trees and watch you.
SARA: I don't get in shape like that. But it's still a good spot. I got my application for Juilliard. Just in time too. They're holding auditions in Baltimore next month.
PATRICK: That's great!
SARA: I'll never be ready in a month.
PATRICK: Sara, you puttin' the mojo on Negative shit. White folks call it karma. The bad kind.
SARA: ( a smile in spite of
PATRICK: Negative shit. White folks call it karma. The bad kind.
SARA: You don't understand. Ballet takes a lot of time, a lot of preparation. I used to practice two, three hours every day. I'm so far behind. Quit whinin' and catch up then.
PATRICK: Quit whinin' and catch up then.
SARA: It's not as easy as that. My free form still sucks. It's still the weakest part of my routine. That hasn't changed.

From a curtain of kids, Malakai suddenly appears at her side. Sara can't move. She's boxed in. Malakai indicates Nikki and Patrick with slick satisfaction, whispers derisively:

NIKKI: Because she's white and he ain't. And don't sit there like you don't know what I'm talkin' about, You don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nikki.
PATRICK: ( glaring at her ) You don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nikki.
NIKKI: I don't? Y'all black men, soon as you even think about goin' someplace good, first thing you do is find a white girl to take with I thought I was goin' someplace good with you. You the one called me off. But you ain't tryin' to remember that. Now you mad. Why? Because she's white and I like her? I'm with her.
PATRICK: I thought I was goin' someplace good with you. You the one called me off. But you ain't tryin' to remember that. Now you mad. Why? Because she's white and I like her? I'm with her.
NIKKI: Please. You're with her because she's white. That's what sets me It ain't got no business settin' you off! Me and her ain't got nothin' to do with you and what you think. So keep your hands off her and that shit to yourself. I don't think it, I know it. But you go ahead, deny it. That's what y'all always do.
PATRICK: ( exasperated ) It ain't got no business settin' you off! Me and her ain't got nothin' to do with you and what you think. So keep your hands off her and that shit to yourself. I don't think it, I know it. But you go ahead, deny it. That's what y'all always do.
NIKKI: I don't think it, I know it. But you go ahead, deny it. That's what y'all always do.
CHENILLE: What? I'm supposed to get excited because you decided to skate by and drop a dollar on the dresser?
KENNY: It's more than a dollar. And it's all I got. I got laid off rom B.W.I., Chenille. I been workin' part- time. Money's tight. You know how you are about money. That's way I haven't been coming around. Money ain't got nothin' to do with it, Kenny. You don't come around because you don't feel like comin' around. You don't want the responsibility of comin' around. As long as you out there and I'm in here, you know your son's being taken care of. You ain't got no worries when it comes to him.
CHENILLE: Money ain't got nothin' to do with it, Kenny. You don't come around because you don't feel like comin' around. You don't want the responsibility of comin' around. As long as you out there and I'm in here, you know your son's being taken care of. You ain't got no worries when it comes to him.
KENNY: And you don't have no feelings when it comes to me. All you do is bitch and complain about what I don't do. I get sick of that.
CHENILLE: Be sick of it. You ain't got to see me to see your son.
KENNY: I'll be sure to keep that in mind.
SARA: Want me to take him?
CHENILLE: That wench. You gotta stand over her to make sure she puts your name on the damn list. Triflin'
SARA: I'll get 'em. So your old man flipped about the Probably thinks it's all Patrick's No. I explained about Nikki.
CHENILLE: So your old man flipped about the Probably thinks it's all Patrick's No. I explained about Nikki.
SARA: No. I explained about Nikki.
CHENILLE: Right. You put it all on her. None of it's on you.
SARA: She started it, Chenille. She wanted to start it. I told you what she said. Maybe she didn't have no business gettin' in your face. But she had a reason to say what she said.
CHENILLE: Maybe she didn't have no business gettin' in your face. But she had a reason to say what she said.
SARA: So you agree with her? You think I don't belong with Patrick.
CHENILLE: What I think don't matter. But you and him act like it don't bother people that you're together. Like it don't hurt people to see.
SARA: ( her Irish up ) We like each other. What is the big fucking deal? It's him and me. Not us and other 'people.' Black people, Sara. Black women. ( passionately ) Patrick's about somethin'. He's smart. He's motivated. He's for real. He ain't gonna make no babies and not take care of 'em or run the streets, fuck up his life. He's gonna do somethin' with himself. Here you come, white and right, and you take one of the few decent men left after jail, drugs and drive-bys. That's what Nikki meant about you up in our world. There's only one world, Chenille. ( pauses ) I thought we were friends. Guess I was wrong.
CHENILLE: Black people, Sara. Black women. Patrick's about somethin'. He's smart. He's motivated. He's for real. He ain't gonna make no babies and not take care of 'em or run the streets, fuck up his life. He's gonna do somethin' with himself. Here you come, white and right, and you take one of the few decent men left after jail, drugs and drive-bys. That's what Nikki meant about you up in our world.
SARA: There's only one world, Chenille. I thought we were friends. Guess I was wrong.
MALAKAI: So what you gonna do?
PATRICK: How many times you gonna ask me It's payback time. Either you down or you ain't. Either you m'boy or you not. Simple as that. Even if I did ride, you ain't got nobody but Lip and Lip will get a nigger's ass killed. Quick.
MALAKAI: It's payback time. Either you down or you ain't. Either you m'boy or you not. Simple as that. Even if I did ride, you ain't got nobody but Lip and Lip will get a nigger's ass killed. Quick.
PATRICK: Even if I did ride, you ain't got nobody but Lip and Lip will get a nigger's ass killed. Quick.
MALAKAI: Eastside ain't got no firepower. I got some shit, man. AK-47. We go in, get out with one spray Just then Snookie and Sara walk toward them from the dance floor. Something in their faces unsettles Sara but Snookie, oblivious, dances up to the bar, snapping his fingers and bobbing his head.
SNOOKIE: You see us, Patrick?
MALAKAI: ( a storm warning ) You see us, man? We're rappin'.
SNOOKIE: Me and Sara lit it up! Y-e-o-w!
PATRICK: That shit ain't funny.
SNOOKIE: ( springing up ) Damn right it ain't funny.
MALAKAI: I thought you liked it down there. That's your specialty, ain't it? That was a reflex action, man. And you just plain rude and wrong to bring the shit up in mixed
SNOOKIE: That was a reflex action, man. And you just plain rude and wrong to bring the shit up in mixed
SARA: I gotta get home. Ready?
MALAKAI: No, he ain't ready. He's talkin'. To me. A-B conversation. Gotta go? C yourself the fuck home.
SARA: ( a real reflex action ) Fuck you.
PATRICK: Have you lost your motherfuckin' MIND, man? Huh? Have you!
SNOOKIE: Patrick, man, c'mon. But Malakai and Patrick stay where they stand. Too close for comfort. Both in the danger zone. Malakai regards Patrick with a combination of cruel anger and deep, genuine hurt.
MALAKAI: You take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine?
PATRICK: 'Cause you wrong, Malakai!
MALAKAI: No! You wrong. You BEEN wrong. You ain't worth shit no more. Get out my face, and take that ho with you. Patrick bucks up. Sara walks over to him, gently clutches his sleeve. It's no easier to turn away from Malakai than it is to walk away from a lifetime of friendship. But Patrick does. With Sara holding onto his arm, at his side, he turns and walks away.
SARA: We should keep going.
PATRICK: You messed up.
SARA: I know I messed up. I'll get it right the next time.
PATRICK: No. You gonna get it right now so you can do it perfect next time. She glares at him, exasperated. So many things bottled
SARA: I can't work like this. I can't dance like this.
PATRICK: Like what?
SARA: Like this. You dictating to me. He crosses the room, CUTS OFF the MUSIC. Looks at her. Sara walks over to a window seat near him. Flops down.
PATRICK: What's wrong, Sara?
SARA: Nothing's wrong. I can't figure things out.
PATRICK: What things? The audition? You ain't got nothin' to worry about. I told you. I'll be there.
SARA: Things, Patrick. Things between us. Things between us and them.
PATRICK: I didn't know there was a 'them.'
SARA: Well, open your pretty brown eyes, look the hell around.
PATRICK: They only got a point if you believe they got a point, Sara.
SARA: I'm just saying that we should think about this, that's all.
PATRICK: That's a fuckin' 'nough.
SARA: Why are you getting mad?
PATRICK: Because I like to think for myself, run my own life, and I thought you did too.
SARA: You're never gonna run your own life as long as you keep running back to Malakai every time he fucks up or fucks you over.
PATRICK: First of all, Malakai ain't never fucked me over. Second of all, you don't know him, Sara, what he been through. Matter of fact, you don't know shit about none of it. So don't come off to me like you I know he's lost, Patrick! Everybody but you can see that. And if you keep reaching back for him, you're gonna wind up lost
SARA: I know he's lost, Patrick! Everybody but you can see that. And if you keep reaching back for him, you're gonna wind up lost
PATRICK: Who the fuck are you to say he's lost? Malakai had my back when you were busy gee-whizzin' in the woods with your backward-ass, redneck friends.
SARA: They weren't rednecks! Patrick yanks his boombox off the floor, glares at her.
PATRICK: You know what? The hell with you. The hell with you too!
SARA: The hell with you too!
DAY: Sara exits, looking pretty much like she feels. Like shit. She walks a few paces. Sees Patrick. Their eyes connect for a brief, awful moment before they continue on their respective ways.
SARA: Patrick doesn't say anything at first. But then:
PATRICK: Thought you might need this on Saturday. I ain't gonna be able to make it.
TONI: Lovers' quarrel? You're better off. That menace to society would've broken your heart and spent all your money in a news flash. Trust me on that, Sara.
SARA: Toni, listen carefully. You're a simple bitch and you don't have any friends, black or white, because nobody likes a fucking
ROY: I was wondering. how long you plan on hating me? Maybe I'm an optimist but I hope there's some kind of timetable. Well, I don't wanna bug you. I just came in to say good luck.
ROY: I saw the return address. Got curious. It was open. I read it. I know I shouldn't have but at least now I have an excuse to tell you how proud I am of you, Sara.
SARA: ( quietly miserable ) I was gonna tell you about the audition, Roy. I meant to. Tomorrow's the big day?
ROY: Tomorrow's the big day?
SARA: Uh-huh. The big day.
ROY: You bummed out about it? You're a worse liar than I am
SARA: You're not so bad. I didn't give you much to work with. It's not like I've been the perfect daughter.
ROY: Well, it ain't like I deserve a perfect daughter. I screwed up. Did everything in a hurry and still thought I had all the time in the world. To be in love with your mother. Be a father to you. But time flies. You look up one day and all you got to show for yourself is a pretty little girl who hates your guts and won't talk to you because too much time went I don't hate you. I miss her. I miss Mom. . Patrick's pissed at me. I'm pissed at him. He's not coming tomorrow and I want him there and I don't know what to do. You want him there. I understand that. But whatever he brings to the table, Patrick can't dance for you, Sara. You're the bottom line out there. This is your chance to be the dancer Juilliard came to I wanted somebody there who loves
SARA: I don't hate you. I miss her. I miss Mom. . Patrick's pissed at me. I'm pissed at him. He's not coming tomorrow and I want him there and I don't know what to do. You want him there.

SARA: I wanted somebody there who loves
ROY: I love you.
MALAKAI: Why his mom's cryin' like that? Arvel's gonna make it, right? That what's his nurse said. She told me herself, 'Your friend's gonna make it.' Did that bitch lie to me! Talk to me, Patrick! Is he gone?
PATRICK: They just got bad news, man. They don't need to hear it again. Arvel's fightin'. He's gonna pull through. Thing is, when he does, they don't think. he ain't. shit. Arvel ain't gonna walk
MALAKAI: I got a good reason now, man?
PATRICK: ( a fleeting hesitation ) . When it's on, I'll be there.
CHENILLE: Why you so quiet? Patrick Reynolds ain't got nothin' to say? That's a first. You know how I go off on folks sometimes. I mean it and then I don't mean it. Like what I said to Sara. Guess she told you.
PATRICK: ( monotone ) I don't care what you said, Patrick. Your ass is on your back and your lips are on the ground. You care, baby brother. And not just about what I said. ( as he looks at her ) You seriously like Sara. She got a serious jones for you. Am I It's besides the point. Whatever point it is you tryin' to make.

PATRICK: It's besides the point. Whatever point it is you tryin' to make.
CHENILLE: I'm sayin' you can't help who you love, Patrick. At least you found somebody who loves you back.
PATRICK: I gotta go.
CHENILLE: To where? To who? Malakai? You ain't through with that fool He's not a fool, Chenille.
PATRICK: He's not a fool, Chenille.
CHENILLE: No. You know what? You're the fool, Patrick. You think you let Malakai down and all you did was try to pull yourself up. Ain't no blame or shame in that.
PATRICK: ( very low; a broken smile ) I still gotta go. Check you
KENNY: It cut me, what you said.
CHENILLE: ( means this ) I shouldn't have. I was You always trip. I'm used to that. Besides, you were right. You were wrong, too. So was I. I need to do better. Ain't no doubt about that.
KENNY: You always trip. I'm used to that. Besides, you were right. You were wrong, too. So was I. I need to do better. Ain't no doubt about that.
CHENILLE: I know I come down on you hard about money, but I would rather you spend the time. Seriously.
KENNY: ( jokingly ) So you don't want any money?
CHENILLE: I didn't say all that. He smiles. Gently rubs Christopher's brow. Looks at her. Chenille smiles at him.
KENNY: I love my son, Chenille. You know that, don't you?
CHENILLE: Yeah. I always knew that.
SAME TIME: The house lights are on. Several seats in the front row are taken up by judges for Juilliard. Further back are the families and friends of other dancers. PUSH IN and FAVOR Roy among them.
PATRICK: Pull over. This ain't helpin' nobody, 'Kai. I'm out. I mean it. Stop the Awww, shit. Here we go.

LIP: Let him out! We don't need him.
MALAKAI: Shut the fuck up.
NIGHT: Pince-Nez leads Sara to the stage. Announces her. Sara walks onstage. She nods down at the judges, looks out into the audience. Her eyes anxiously search for Patrick. hoping. Her MUSIC begins. Grieg's Peer Gynt ( Morning ). Sara starts to sway, moving like an angel through the soft cloud of this music. Her line, proportion and balance are impeccable.
SARA: finishes with a flawless arabesque. Looks out.
STERN JUDGE: You prepared a free-form?
SARA: Yes. sir. they have. my Does it have a theme?

SARA: Yes. Emo.

SARA: I'm sorry. I wasn't ready. Can you start it over again?

SARA: Thank you. Very much.
STERN JUDGE: Ms. Johnson!
STERN JUDGE: I can't say this on the record yet. But welcome to Juilliard.
SARA'S FACE: lovely and radiant as it breaks into a cheek-to-cheek smile. WIDER as she walks slowly, deliberately back to Patrick. Stops. Looks at him. Just looks. And then she throws her arms around his neck, kissing and hugging him. Emotional. Patrick swings her into the air, twirls her around and around, as we:
