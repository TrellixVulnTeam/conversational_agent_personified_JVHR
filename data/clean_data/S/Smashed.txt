SMASHED: Written by James Ponsoldt & Susan Burke
DETERMINED": FADE IN:
KARAOKE STAGE: in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar. Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke version of "SONG TO BE DETERMINED." What Kate lacks in talent she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm. At a table near the stage is CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with OWEN HANNAH Charlie's younger brother, early-20's who sings along with the small but energetic CROWD. Kate begins to ramble between verses and gleefully points to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the Queen of Karaoke.
LATER: Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to join Charlie and Owen.
CHARLIE: That was so good, baby!
KATE: I'm serious. You sing like an angel a drunk angel.
CHARLIE: I'm serious. You sing like an angel a drunk angel.
KATE: If you were writing about my performance for your blog, what would you say?
CHARLIE: I'd say that, uh.my wife is the sexiest, most amazing woman alive.
KATE: That would be such a shitty article nobody would read it.
OWEN: Yeah I've been trying to flirt with the bartender, but.I can't
KATE: She's hot! What can't you tell?
OWEN: She looks like she could kick my ass. No way would she go for a guy like me.
KATE: You're being a little girl just go talk to her.
OWEN: ( clearly shy ) I don't know.forget about it.
KATE: ( not going to take "no" I'll take point follow me.
FEMALE BARTENDER: The bartender quickly pours the drinks.
KATE: Wait don't you wanna know what happened to him? What happened?
FEMALE BARTENDER: ( unenthused ) What happened?
KATE: He just got back from England because he went there for a girl! A preppy, bitchy girl. Diane Court.that was her name. He loved her so much that he went with her because she had a fellowship or something. He gave up being a kickboxer. A kickboxer! And she dumped him.
FEMALE BARTENDER: ( to Owen ) You kickbox?
OWEN: ( caught in the headlights )
KATE: ( jumping in ) And he teaches kids at the kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so
OWEN: ( finally ) A lot of `em don't have parents so.it's kinda more than just a teacher/student thing. ( beat ) I know it sounds silly, but I feel responsible for them like. ( emotional ) .I could be their parent.
KATE: ( hushed ) I think I got him laid.
CHARLIE: She seems totally game.
KATE: She seems totally game.
CHARLIE: Sure she just didn't want to get into your pants?
KATE: I think I'm done for the night.
CHARLIE: Owen wanders over, dejected.
OWEN: She's seen "Say Anything."
CHARLIE: Eh, well.what're you gonna do, Wanna drive us home?
KATE: No he needs to keep working it! You guys stay here.
CHARLIE: I don't want to watch my brother not score. I want to go to bed with you and. .you know.
KATE: I'll be home when you get there. We can "you know" then.
OWEN: ( to Charlie ) Yeah, man you don't have a job to wake up for in the morning or Writing is a job! Not having to report to an office only makes work ( to Kate ) Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen should take us home you're too drunk to drive.
CHARLIE: Writing is a job! Not having to report to an office only makes work Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen should take us home you're too drunk to drive.
KATE: So's Owen. I'm not that drunk. Besides, you know I focus when I drive it sobers me up.
CHARLIE: Tell that to the cops.
KATE: ( to Charlie ) I love you, baby. I'll be waiting for you in a nice warm bed. You have exactly one mission: get your brother laid and don't talk to any other women. That sounds like two missions.
CHARLIE: That sounds like two missions.
KATE: No, it's just one.
CHARLIE: ( to Owen ) It kinda sounded like two, right?
OWEN: ( nodding ) It did.
KATE: ( really fast ) You okay?
KATE: You okay?
FREDA: ( quick ) Yeah. Are you?
KATE: ( taken aback ) ( whispers ) Hey, I'm not really okay.
FREDA: ( whispers ) Hey, I'm not really okay.
KATE: My bitch sister just took off and left me here so she could hook up with some asshole. Now what am I supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a car here.
FREDA: My bitch sister just took off and left me here so she could hook up with some asshole. Now what am I supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a car here.
KATE: I guess I could.
FREDA: You'll give me a ride? Oh my god! Thank you!
KATE: I was gonna say "call you a cab," `cause, you know I don't even know you.
FREDA: It's not far. Please? Pretty
FREDA: You know, you shouldn't drink and I wasn't

FREDA: Just kidding. Can I have a sip?

FREDA: Can I smoke in your car?
KATE: ( slightly annoyed ) Okay, fine go ahead. Can you just roll down the window?
FREDA: Of course I'm not uncivilized.
KATE: ( in disbelief )
WHOA!: Kate immediately pulls the car over.
FREDA: Want a hit?
KATE: No, I.is that pot?
FREDA: ( as though it's a Of course not! What do I look like? A stoner?
KATE: Oh, shit! No.no thank you.
FREDA: C'mon it's good crack.
KATE: I don't, um.I've never smoked Really? This stuff is the truth and it'll sober you up.
FREDA: ( surprised ) Really? This stuff is the truth and it'll sober you up.
KATE: Uh.I think you should go.
FREDA: I'm not getting out in the middle of nowhere. Do you know what could happen to me all alone out here at I don't know people might offer you crack?
KATE: I don't know people might offer you crack?
FREDA: Seriously? It's not a big deal just take a little hit.
KATE: I said no.
FREDA: One hit won't hurt you. It'll sober you up. Smoke me!
KATE: One puff. Then we are both going
FREDA: You've got money, right?
LATER: Freda is passed out on a SLEEPING BAG on the sidewalk. Kate is animatedly telling a story to the two guys who're still smoking crack.
KATE: ( mile-a-minute fast ) .'cause I feel like I understand what it's like to be homeless, ya know? I mean, if you didn't know me, if we hadn't connected tonight, you might think: "There's some upper-middle-class, NPR listening, self-congratulatory, insulated, lazy liberal bitch. Probably never had to worry about anything." But that's not true at all! I grew up poor, man. Single mother. McDonald's used to have one day a week where they sold 29 cent hamburgers, and another day where they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My mom and me would go there and she'd get twenty burgers that was the limit, probably set up for folks just like us and then she'd put `em in the freezer and we'd microwave `em for dinner throughout the week.

LATER: The meeting has begun and everyone sits in a circle of Jenny is midway through her speech.
JENNY: .all I knew about taking care of myself was fucking people over and lying to get by. I had no idea how to even look for a normal job or pay my bills on time or pay my fucking bills at all. Now I pay my bills online.
KATE: I kinda like her.
MR. DAVIES: Sponsor potential?
KATE: I feel like you're my wingman.
LATER: An older man ARLO stands and announces.
ARLO: Arlo, Alcoholic. There'll now be a ten minute break. Smoke em' if you got em.
KATE: Hey, I liked your speech.
JENNY: Thanks. All that dumb shit happened so I'm glad that now it's at least What's your name?
KATE: Kate. This is my first meeting. Or. first meeting where I'm not
JENNY: Oh, yeah I remember doing some of that.
KATE: I don't really know how this stuff But.could I get your number? I mean, I may not need it, but.
JENNY: Yeah, of course. I can help explain it to you and also, we can just Okay. Yeah. You've been sober since you were
KATE: Okay. Yeah. You've been sober since you were
JENNY: I didn't have much of a choice I crashed my car into a nursing home. I think the break is just about over. This meeting is the kind where everyone can share. Sharing always helps me, so.if it's not too weird try introducing yourself and telling the group what's going on.
LATER: Everyone is sitting down and sharing. The woman ( TINA ) next to Kate is finishing up.
TINA: .anyway, that's where I'm at today. Thanks for listening.
KATE: Okay, um.hello. I'm Kate and. .I'm an alcoholic?
GROUP: Hi, Kate.
KATE: Sorry. I don't mean to laugh it's just saying those words. .I think I'm an alcoholic, but I don't really know. I drink a lot. I've always drank. Everyone I know drinks a lot. I never really thought I had a problem lately though it seems like maybe I do. I just want to be able to drink a beer without it turning into twenty or wetting my bed. It seems like every time I drink something awful happens. All the shit that I used to laugh off isn't really funny anymore. The dumb drunk stuff has gone from embarrassing to scary. I'm kinda.scared.
MR. DAVIES: Is there anyone here who has ninety days of continuous sobriety?
DAY CHIP.": I'm Kate. I'm an alcoholic.
KATE: I'm Kate. I'm an alcoholic.
EVERYONE: Hi, Kate.
JENNY: ( whispered )
JENNY: I'm really proud of you, Kate.
KATE: I kinda can't believe it's been ninety days. The longest I've gone since high school without drinking was, like, a week.
MR. DAVIES: My first three months were such hell. I think I'm only sober today because I just never want to go through that again.
KATE: It's weird in after-school specials the getting-sober part was only like a minute of the movie and suddenly.daddy's all okay.
JENNY: Like what?
KATE: Everything else. Work, my non- existent relationship with my When was the last time you saw her?
JENNY: When was the last time you saw her?
KATE: ( tries to remember ) A year, at least.
JENNY: Well.maybe it's time.
KATE: ( beat ) And then there's my marriage. I mean, Charlie's great. Really great, he's supportive, especially at first. It's strange, though. I feel like alcohol was the thing that connected us and now that I don't drink we lead these two very different lives. ( beat ) We haven't slept together in ( laughs ) I haven't pissed myself in awhile, though. So that's good.
JENNY: It takes time.
KATE: I could stick around and help I could take you home. If you want.
MR. DAVIES: ( to Kate ) I could take you home. ( off Kate's reaction ) If you want.
MR. DAVIES: My ex-wife she doesn't drink well, not like us, but as soon as I got sober I started to change and she just.didn't.
KATE: I didn't know you were married. Yeah, I was married once in my other life. But I shouldn't be talking to you about this stuff.
MR. DAVIES: Yeah, I was married once in my other life. But I shouldn't be talking to you about this stuff.
KATE: MR. DAVIES
MR. DAVIES: I don't know.
KATE: Because you're a dude we can't talk? I don't get that "men stick with men, women stick with women" Well, if you were sitting where I'm sitting you'd understand.
MR. DAVIES: Well, if you were sitting where I'm sitting you'd understand.
KATE: Are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me?
MR. DAVIES: What am I, one of your students? Yeah, crush.
KATE: Yeah, crush.
MR. DAVIES: ( long beat ) I kind of do, yes. I have a crush on you. I know that's wrong you're newly sober and married and I shouldn't be thinking about you like that. But yeah, I should put that out on the table. ( beat ) It's okay. I think you're a really good guy.
KATE: It's okay. I think you're a really good guy.
MR. DAVIES: Oh, great good guys are the nerds that carry the pretty girls' Oh, c'mon.
KATE: Oh, c'mon.
MR. DAVIES: I think you're beautiful.
KATE: WHAT THE FUCK? Oh, that was a bad thing to say, I'm so, so sorry. I'm just confused, and I don't know how to talk to women
MR. DAVIES: ( genuinely sorry ) Oh, that was a bad thing to say, I'm so, so sorry. I'm just confused, and I don't know how to talk to women
KATE: MR. DAVIES
MR. DAVIES: I'm so, so sorry. I'm just confused, and I don't know how to talk to women
KATE: Jesus you can't just go around telling people you want to fuck their "moist pussy." Who even says that?
MR. DAVIES: I'm really sorry.
KATE: I have to go inside my house where I live with my husband. Thanks for your creepy version of

CHARLIE: Did I do something?
KATE: ( beat ) We don't talk that much.
CHARLIE: We used to talk, but now you come home and go to meetings and by the time you get back I'm

CHARLIE: With your mom? Kinda. Is this the "amends" step?
KATE: Well then why're you going?
CHARLIE: Well then why're you going?
KATE: ( beat ) We send her checks. But we never actually see her. Sometimes it feels like I'm paying her to not be in my life. I thought it would be nice to visit her. ( beat ) And Jenny thinks it would be a good
CHARLIE: I don't know.I mean, do you do everything your sponsor tells you to do?
KATE: No. Do you think I'm brainwashed or I dunno.it's been a long damn time since you've seen your mom. And you didn't listen when I suggested we visit her.
CHARLIE: I dunno.it's been a long damn time since you've seen your mom. And you didn't listen when I suggested we visit her.
KATE: ( suddenly gets that it's Oh, baby I listen to you. This just.it felt like the right time. ( beat ) With all the changes I'm going Well, can I come with you? It'll be like a little vacation.
CHARLIE: Well, can I come with you? It'll be like a little vacation.

CHARLIE: Come on, if you do that you'll just get depressed. If I go we can try to make it fun. Go hiking and Well, if you go, don't take this the wrong way but I'd like it if maybe you didn't drink. Just while we're there.
KATE: Well, if you go, don't take this the wrong way but I'd like it if maybe you didn't drink. Just while we're there.
CHARLIE: ( smiles ) I think I can handle not drinking for like a day.
CHARLIE: Ah.the lawn-gnomes. I missed those guys.
KATE: ( unsettled ) I should've brought something.
CHARLIE: You're fine.
KATE: Something, you know? Flowers, or.

KATE: I told you I just wanted water.
ROCHELLE: Oh, please! Where I'm from, "no" means "yes." Am I right or am I right?
CHARLIE: ( forcing it ) That's actually why I wanted to come up, mom. ( beat ) I stopped drinking. ( quickly serious ) Are you telling me I'm going to be a grandma?
