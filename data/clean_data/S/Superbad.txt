SUPERBAD: Written by Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg
SETH: INTERCUT WITH: INT. EVAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 2 2 Evan, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing off a bowl of cereal. He is on his cell phone.
EVAN: What's up?
SETH: I was doing research last night, for next year, and I think I'm gonna go with Bang Which one's Bang Bus?
EVAN: Which one's Bang Bus?
SETH: The one where they bang the chicks on the bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total access, live Web Cam feed. The works. It'll be like I'm on the bus, banging them myself.
EVAN: That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking it. And plus, your parents are gonna look at the bill.
SETH: It shows up under a different name. I hope. Bang Bus.
EVAN: Weapons of Ass Destruction's out then.
SETH: I could tell my parents I'm doing a project on Rome and I have to research
EVAN: ( still into phone ) Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class on blow jobs.
EVAN'S MOM: Thanks for taking him, Seth.
SETH: Don't touch that!
EVAN'S MOM: You two are so funny. I can't imagine what you'll do without each other next year. Evan told me you didn't get into Yeah, you know. I got some other places. Good places. I think we'll be fine.
SETH: Yeah, you know. I got some other places. Good places. I think we'll be fine.
EVAN'S MOM: Are you going to miss each other?
EVAN: Miss each other? No!
SETH: That's disgusting.
MOM: Bye, boys.
SETH: I am truly, truly jealous that you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby.
EVAN: Fuck you, man.
EVAN: You're being an idiot, man. You really shouldn't park there.
SETH: Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate. They should be suckin' my balls. It's the least they can do for stealing three years of my life. What the hell's wrong with Dimitri?
EVAN: What the hell's wrong with Dimitri?
SETH: Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in capture the flag last week.
EVAN: Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash in "King of the Ring." I fucking hate that guy.
SETH: They're like baby toes.
EVAN: It's not fair. I have to hide every erection I get.
SETH: Sometimes I get boners so big I can't hide them. And then I get nervous and my heart starts pounding, and it all just, like, feeds my boner. It just becomes this.thing.that's attached to me. And it won't go away.
EVAN: Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and they actually wanted to see `em, like this shit.
SETH: You know it's been, like, a year and a half since I've seen an actual human female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it last month, and it was sick.
EVAN: Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I guess so. She was insanely hot, though.
SETH: Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks.
EVAN: How can that possibly suck? I'd be fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl that hot. You got, like, two dozen And three quarters of a blowjob, But that was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass- gettin' career, and it happened way, way, way too early.
SETH: And three quarters of a blowjob, But that was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass- gettin' career, and it happened way, way, way too early.
EVAN: You're like Orson Welles.
SETH: Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd probably at least be having steady sex with a mediocre-looking girl at this point. I honestly now see why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death.
EVAN: You'll have sex in college. Everyone does. And if not, you'll have the Bang But the key is to be good at sex by the time you're in college. You don't want girls to think you suck dick at fucking.
SETH: But the key is to be good at sex by the time you're in college. You don't want girls to think you suck dick at fucking.
EVAN: I still think you've got a chance with Jules. She got mad hot over last summer, and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause she still flirts with you.
SETH: Are you joking, man? Let's see here.she dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber and what's-his-face. All of those were cool guys. She's been hot way longer than you think. Why would she end her high school career with me?
EVAN: Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.
SETH: Yeah, and he was a complete fucking loser. You're a step up from that. Which is why you should stop being a pussy and do her! You could nailthe shit out of her for, like, two months before you leave. That bitch looks like a good Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her like that, man!
EVAN: Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her like that, man!
SETH: What, you can talk about that bitch all day every single day, but I can't say one thing about her?
EVAN: I don't constantly insult her.
SETH: I didn't insult her! I said she looks like a good fucker! She looks like she can take a dick. That's a good thing. Some women pride themselves on their dick- taking abilities.
TERRY: Yo. Seth. Did you hear I'm having the big grad party?
SETH: Terry spits on Seth's shirt.
TERRY: Terry spits on Seth's shirt.
EVAN: Wow. You really bitched out on that one.
SETH: I bitched out? You bitched out! You were across the street before I even realized what was going on. That guy's such a douche bag.
SETH: ( panting )
KID: ( as he passes Seth ) Hey Evan, thanks for the pen.
HELEN: Hey Evan, thanks for the pen.
EVAN: Oh, don't worry, no worries. Just keep it. Then you'll just have it, and you won't have to borrow another pen.
HELEN: Thanks.uh.I was going to ask you, did you hear about Terry's grad party? It's going to be so insane.
EVAN: Yeah, it's a maybe. But, you know, I gotta, I got my.
HELEN: Fun shit? But I, like, never see you at any parties or anything.
EVAN: Because of all the other fun shit I'm off Okay. So why weren't you at Dimitri's party on Saturday?
HELEN: ( playful ) Okay. So why weren't you at Dimitri's party on Saturday?
EVAN: Dimitri's? I uh.didn't want to go, because, well, I did other stuff. Oh yeah! Saturday night was awesome!
EVAN: .and we had a couple drinks in my
EVAN: .and there were actually some really interesting and, like, entertaining people there.
EVAN: .then we went to a club downtown.
EVAN: .and then we pretty much called it a night and went home.
EVAN: .you would've loved it.
HELEN: That sounds so fun. I would love to go do something like that.
EVAN: Yeah.well, you know, me and Seth are always cooking up.uh.fun
HELEN: So, are you guys going to the same school next year?
EVAN: Nah. We were going to but, uh, we got into different ones.
HELEN: What are you going to do without him?
EVAN: Same shit I've always been doing. It'll be fine. Don't worry about it. I'm not.
SETH: Mrs. Grier, I joined this class because I thought I'd be cooking with a partner. It's not fair. She's never here. I don't get twice the marks for doing all the I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.
MRS. GREIR: I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.
SETH: Look at Evan.
MRS. GREIR: Well, save it for next week. Today Jules' partner isn't here either. Pair up with her. Station four.
SETH: The teacher walks away. Seth looks over to station four, nervous as hell. ANGLE ON: Jules, well-dressed and "popular" looking. She stands alone at station four, laying out utensils. Seth musters his courage and walks towards Jules. He stops, unsure of what to say.
JULES: Hey Seth, your partner didn't come again?
SETH: That's kind of a personal question.
JULES: ( nervous ) Nothing. It was my attempt at humour.
SETH: ( nervous ) Nothing. It was my attempt at humour.
JULES: Well, uh, maybe I kidnapped her so you'd be forced to work with me. There's my attempt at humour.
SETH: Well, I would call that a success. Marscampone. scamponee cheese? Is that some kind of new cheese or something?
JULES: All cheese tastes the same to me anyway.
SETH: Except blue cheese. That stuff is sick.
JULES: Thank you! Yes! My older brother always eats blue cheese. You know that stuff is actually moldy. Like, they tell you it's moldy, then they tell you to eat it Well whoever "they" are, they can eat my
SETH: Well whoever "they" are, they can eat my
JULES: What are you doing tonight?
SETH: I don't know, probably nothing. Why?
JULES: My parents are out of town and I'm thinking of having a party. I don't know how big it'll be, but you should come Yeah. Sure. That sounds fun. I love Really? I don't usually see you at them.
SETH: Yeah. Sure. That sounds fun. I love Really? I don't usually see you at them.
JULES: Really? I don't usually see you at them.
SETH: Oh, uh. It's more of, like, a love-hate thing. Right now I love them, though. Uh.how do I do this?
JULES: I'll write down my address and number.
EVAN: That's good shit. Huh, Miroki?
SETH: ( whispering ) Dude! She's havin' a fuckin' party.
FOGELL: Hey guys, I was walking here, and on the way, I saw Nicola, and she was wearing these tight white pants and a black g- string and you could see it right through the pants.
FOGELL: It's nine thirty.
NICOLA: INT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM ( PRESENT ) - CONTINUOUS 18 18 Back to Fogell, Seth and Evan.
FOGELL: I told her what time it was. It was awesome. She's got the nicest ass.
SETH: Like you'd know what to do with it.
FOGELL: Ha ha. I'm really gonna miss your knee- slappers when me and Evan are at State.
SETH: ( pissed ) Yeah, well I'll be at Junior college where the girls are half as smart, and thus twice as likely to blow me.
FOGELL: What are you guys doing tonight?
SETH: Nothing. Sorry. You'll just have to fingerbang yourself.
EVAN: ( to Fogell ) What you doing?
FOGELL: Well, Seth always said I was too much of a pussy, but he was wrong. It's been arranged. At lunch, I'm going to the same place Mike Snider went to pick up my brand new false identification card.
SETH: Dude! That's perfect, `cause, Evan, didn't you just say that you heard about a party?
FOGELL: ( to Evan ) Why didn't you tell me?
SETH: Shut up. Who cares? Just be happy he told. And hey! Now you can buy the booze.
FOGELL: Sounds cool. Cool.
EVAN: Well done, man. We'll see you after
SETH: Did you tell that nimrod you're not going to room with him?
EVAN: Uh.no, not yet.
SETH: You better, man. That guy is a poon-tang
JULES: Seth, dishes time. What's the hold up?
SETH: We're getting a fake ID.
JULES: Well, you two have four more years to cuddle, so let's get to work.
EVAN: Actually, we're going to different Really? You're cutting the cord? What's going to happen?
JULES: Really? You're cutting the cord? What's going to happen?
SETH: Nothing! Jesus.
EVAN: Yeah? What do people think is gonna happen? That's what I don't get.
SETH: We're not, like, dependent on each other.
EVAN: We met when we were 8, we were fine before then. It's not like we do everything together.
EVAN: So it looks like we get a little graduation party after all.
SETH: I would do terrible things to get with Jules tonight. Terrible things.
EVAN: No shit. I'd give my left foot to start dating Helen. She's killin' me.
SETH: Ah, Helen's a bitch.
EVAN: I'm fuckin' sick of this shit, man! Seriously. Why do you hate her? Is there even an actual reason? Because seriously, I'm beginning you think you like her.
SETH: Hell no! I hate her.
EVAN: I was never going to tell you this story, because I knew that if you heard it you would never want to get with Helen, but over the last few weeks I've been having a hard time thinking of a reason not to. So, here it is. Helen and I went to elementary school together, right? Well, in the third grade, I had.like.an odd problem. For some reason, I don't know why, I used to have this thing.where I would.like, kinda.sit around all day and draw pictures of dicks.

EVAN: INT/EXT VARIOUS LOCATIONS 20 20 A MONTAGE of FLASHBACKS of YOUNG SETH ( Age 10 ) drawing pictures of dicks in various places. A PARK, AT HOME, IN A SANDBOX, and finally, in a SCHOOL CLASSROOM.
EVAN: What does that have to do with Helen?
SETH: Just listen.
EVAN: You hit Helen's foot with your dick?
SETH: Well she fucking flipped. She started crying and shit. Ratted me out.
SETH: So, he calls my parents and they make me go to a psychologist who kept asking me all these dick questions. My parents wouldn't even let me eat dick-shaped foods for, like, months! No carrots, no Pop-sicles, no hot-dogs. You know how many fucking foods are shaped like dick?
EVAN: ( half amazed, half amused ) Wow. That's really messed up.
SETH: I can't even stand to look at her punk I'm going to go take a piss. Peace.
JULES: Seth. There you are.
SETH: Hey. Here I am.
JULES: So you're coming to my party, right? It's fully on.
SETH: Yeah. Why? Should I not?
JULES: No, no, no. I really want you to come. But.uh, you did say you were getting a fake ID or something, is that right?
SETH: Very right. Right. I'm getting that.
SHIRLEY: Can you get us drinks?
SETH: Ummm. I don't know. I. think.maybe.
JULES: ( half joking ) Come on, you scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours.
SETH: Well, funny thing about my back. It's located on my cock. Ha! Alright, sure. I can do that. What do you guys want?
JULES: Well, this is actually, like, a big favor, but, well, my parents gave me like a hundred bucks to feed myself for the week, but the house if full of food, so I figure I should just spend all of it on extra drinks for the party.
SETH: Wow. I would never even think of doing something that nice.
JULES: Well, this is really nice of you. I mean, I really appreciate this.
SETH: Should I just get, like, a shitload of different shit?
JULES: Whatever shit you think people would like, I don't really know.
SHIRLEY: I want Mike's Hard Lemonade.
JULES: Okay. I'll see you tonight.
SETH: Yeah! I'll see you!
GYM TEACHER: Evan, get into the game.
SETH: ( out of breath, worked up ) Man, just - Evan, listen to me. You know Jules? You know what she just did? She came up to me and asked me if I would buy her alcohol. Not just her, her whole party. Do you know what that means? It means that by some miracle, we were paired up, we talked, and she actually thought of me afterwards. Thought of me enough to decide that I was the guy that she was going to trust the fun-ness of her party with. She wants me! She fucking wants my dick!
EVAN: Did you ever think maybe she's just using you to get her alcohol?
SETH: Of course I thought of that! LISTEN TO
THIS!: INT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM ( FLASHBACK ) 32 32 The same scene as before with Seth and Jules in class.
JULES: Yeah! My older brother always eats blue cheese. You know that stuff is actually She has an older brother! She could have asked him, but she asked me! She looked me straight in the face and asked me. She wants to fuck me, man. Do you understand that? Fucking! Today is the day that fucking has become possible.
SETH: She has an older brother! She could have asked him, but she asked me! She looked me straight in the face and asked me. She wants to fuck me, man. Do you understand that? Fucking! Today is the day that fucking has become possible.
EVAN: Are you stupid? You're not going to be able to sleep with her tonight.
SETH: She's going to be at the party, she's gonna be drunk, and she likes me at least a little, so I can get with her. Then, I make her my girlfriend, and then I fuck her all summer long! Then, by the time college rolls around, I'm the fuckin' fucking master, man!
EVAN: Make her your girlfriend? Of course! That's good. So, hypnosis, love potion, or mind-control helmet?
SETH: Once I've gotten with her, I write her love letters, flowers, I'll do anything - I'll be the most pussy-whipped guy in the universe - what chick wouldn't go out with a guy like that?
CLASSMATE: What the hell, Evan?
SETH: Fuck off, Greg. Why don't you piss your pants again?
CLASSMATE: That was, like, eight years ago, asshole!
SETH: ( to Evan ) Wanna hear the best part?
EVAN: ( sarcastic ) Oh, I haven't?
SETH: Evan looks upset, assuming that Seth is about to trash-talk Helen, as usual.
EVAN: I should get Helen alcohol?
SETH: Of course! It'll be pimp, and then you know she'll be drunk.
EVAN: Have you talked to Fogell?
SETH: You talk to Helen, I'll find that retard
EVAN: Hey Helen! Hold up. Did you hear about the party tonight?
HELEN: Yeah, I just heard. It sounds sweet. You're not coming, are you?
EVAN: No, no, I am. That's why I came looking for you. Me and some guys are going to the liquor store after class, so I was thinking I could buy you yours, if you needed someone to.
HELEN: Yeah! That'd be great, that'd save me such a hassle, cause I was going to beg my sister, but yeah, could you get me, like, a bottle of Goldschlager? I'll pay you back tonight.
EVAN: You will absolutely not. It's my treat.
HELEN: Wow. Thanks, Evan.
EVAN: ( mortified ) I'm sorry! Shit, shit. I'm so sorry! I just wanted to give you a friendly nudge in the arm, you know? I'm so sorry.
HELEN: ( giggling ) Don't worry about it. So I'll see you at the party?
EVAN: Yeah. I'll see you then. I'm so sorry about that.
SETH: That douche bag isn't back yet, I've been standing here with my thumb up my ass.
EVAN: I did it, dude. I even offered to pay for it. It was pimp.
SETH: Whoa. That is fucking pimp. Why didn't I do that? Shit.
SETH: ( yelling over the machines ) That's what we get for trusting a mental midget! He's fucking it all up! I bet he pussied out, just like I said he would!
SETH: I mean, what are we going to tell the girls? "Sorry, we couldn't do what we promised because we're dickless incompetents!" We'll never get laid because of that little ass-fuck. How did he get in to State?! He's got shit for brains! Shit! How else can we get liquor?
EVAN: Where have you been?
SETH: Yeah! You almost gave me a goddamn heart attack! You better fucking have it, where is it?
FOGELL: I got it. It's flawless! It's great, man,
EVAN: ( reading the card ) Okay Mr."McLovin"? What kind of a stupid name is that? What are you trying to be, an Irish R&B singer?
FOGELL: Well, they let you pick any name you want when you get there.
SETH: So you picked McLovin?
FOGELL: It was between that or Muhammad.
SETH: Why was it between that or Muhammad? Why didn't you just pick a common name?
FOGELL: Actually, Seth, Muhammad is the most commonly used name on earth.
EVAN: Have you ever actually met a guy named Have you actually ever met a guy named No! That's why you picked a bad name.
FOGELL: Have you actually ever met a guy named No! That's why you picked a bad name.
SETH: No! That's why you picked a bad name.
EVAN: You probably have federal agents tracking you for even considering the name Muhammad on a fake ID!
SETH: Look at this shit man, you don't even have a first name. It just says "NAME:
MCLOVIN": One name?
EVAN: One name?
FOGELL: I just thought McLovin sounded old, and the chicks would dig it.
EVAN: Under what circumstances would you ever have to show a chick your ID?
FOGELL: She could ask. Or, I could just show it to her.
SETH: Holy shit! I don't believe this. This says you're fucking 25! Why didn't you just put 21?
FOGELL: I knew you would ask that. Look, every day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor store with fake ID's trying to act like Joe Casual. Each and every one of these kids just so happens to be 21 years old. Just how many 21 year-olds do you think there are?
SETH: Calm down! It's not terrible! This might work, but it's up to you, Fogell. They'll either think, "Oh, it's another punk kid with a fake ID." Or, "Look, it's McLovin, the twenty five year-old organ donor". What's it gonna be?
EVAN: Calm down! It's not terrible! This might work, but it's up to you, Fogell. They'll either think, "Oh, it's another punk kid with a fake ID." Or, "Look, it's McLovin, the twenty five year-old organ donor". What's it gonna be?
FOGELL: I am McLovin.
SETH: You're not McLovin. No one's McLovin and this is never going to work. We need a new way to get alcohol. Could we drive to Canada or something?
FOGELL: I still think it's going to work.
SETH: What the fuck? Where's my car?
EVAN: I told you, man! What did I say? I told you that was a dumb idea.
FOGELL: Why would you park in the staff-
SETH: Shut up, Fogell.
FOGELL: `Cause you're not staff.
SETH: I am aware of that, Fagell.
FOGELL: ( yelling ) Will you still pick me up from work?
SETH: Let's go to your house.
SETH: Now we wait for your Mom to piss off and steal your parents' booze like your brother always does. Take a bit from every bottle. Piece of cake. It's not exactly what Jules wanted, but it'll do, Come on! Just wear what you wore to I told you I can't do that. I can't let Jules see me in the same shit I wore at school. It's completely unbecoming.
EVAN: Come on! Just wear what you wore to I told you I can't do that. I can't let Jules see me in the same shit I wore at school. It's completely unbecoming.
SETH: I told you I can't do that. I can't let Jules see me in the same shit I wore at school. It's completely unbecoming.
EVAN: Why don't you just go to your house and get your own clothes? `Cause this is You're stupid! I can't go home. Then my mom will know the car got towed and I'll be grounded tonight. I'll just stay here all weekend and pick it up on Monday.
SETH: You're stupid! I can't go home. Then my mom will know the car got towed and I'll be grounded tonight. I'll just stay here all weekend and pick it up on Monday.
EVAN: ( RE: video game ) Where the fuck is the dirt bike? ( beat ) Ah, screw it. I'm just gonna kill everyone. Boom! Die, piggies!!!
SETH: Don't you have bigger clothes?
EVAN: See what my dad's got.
SETH: Not bad, eh?
EVAN: It's, like, 7:30 and my Mom's still here.
SETH: Alright, here's what we'll do. I'll fuck your Mom in the basement while you steal the liquor.
EVAN: Fuck you, asshole. Let's just sneak down there and grab it.
SETH: ( whispering ) Alright, dude. Get ready to receive.
EVAN: ( whispering ) I can't believe it. They marked them.
SETH: ( whispering ) What do you mean they.oh, man! Your parents are fuckers. What do we do now?
EVAN: ( whispering ) Shh!!! We.we.take some and fill it back up with water. Get ready, I'll get ( whispering ) Gin? That stuff is literally undrinkable.
SETH: ( whispering ) It's the biggest bottle, you douche. Just do it! She's right in the other room!
EVAN: ( whispering ) ( whispering ) But, the booze?
SETH: ( whispering ) But, the booze?
EVAN: ( whispering ) Take it!
EVAN'S MOM: Love you, sweety.
SETH: Look at this mother. Smell it's glory.
EVAN: It's fucking water!
SETH: ( drinks again ) Fuck. Your brother beat us to the punch. We have to go back!
EVAN: We can't go back! She totally knew, she'll bust us for sure, and we have to meet Fogell.
SETH: Well, fuck.fine. Text your brother he's a stupid piece of crap.
SETH: What the hell is that?
FOGELL: A vest.
SETH: You're gonna look like a Pinocchio.
EVAN: What? It's just a vest.
FOGELL: Yeah. How many high schoolers you see in You know, they got a ton of liquor right in there. If we get it now we can get to the party faster with all of Jules' shit.
SETH: ( eyeing Shopwell's ) You know, they got a ton of liquor right in there. If we get it now we can get to the party faster with all of Jules' shit.
FOGELL: No way! I work there. They know I'm not Nobody said anything about you, dick- mouth. You have one name on your ID. It's out of the equation!
SETH: Nobody said anything about you, dick- mouth. You have one name on your ID. It's out of the equation!
FOGELL: What?! No! Hell no! You can't do that!
EVAN: ( mocking ) Yeah, right!
SETH: That's right. And that way I give Jules back her money, like you did with Helen. That was good thinking, that's fucking pimp. That's how you seal a deal. It won't be hard. Remember Dan Vertlieb stole a keg from here and he's got, like, really bad scoliosis!
EVAN: You're not gonna steal it. Fogell, he's not going to steal it.
FOGELL: Please. Don't do this! I promise. I'll get the liquor later.
SETH: I'm stepping up. And once I'm up, I don't step back down. Maybe you "State" boys don't understand that.
SETH: ( to himself ) Hope piggy can run.
CASHIER: How old are you?
SETH: Twenty two.
CASHIER: You certainly are. That'll be eighty
SETH: Thank you kindly.
CASHIER: You're welcome, Seth.
SETH: Excuse me, ma'am. You dropped your purse. Would you like me to help you to your That would be lovely, young man. Would you like me to buy you alcohol?
OLD LADY: That would be lovely, young man. Would you like me to buy you alcohol?
SETH: That would be lovely!
SETH: Enjoy your remaining years!
OLD LADY: I will. Enjoy fucking Jules!
"GOLDSCHLAGER.": SECURITY GAURD ( O.S. )
SETH: I never had a choice.
OLD LADY: ( in agony )
AAAHHHHH!!!: Before Seth can do anything, the guard smashes a 40-ounce bottle of beer across his face. The guard SWINGS the broken end of the bottle and cuts Seth's throat. Blood spurts out. Seth drops his bottles and falls to the ground.
FOGELL: Oh, and, uh, my Mom said we can have the TV from her basement and I've got, like, three lava-lamps and one strobe light, so like, we can have that in the room-
EVAN: Shh. Seth's coming.
FOGELL: You still didn't tell him we're rooming-
EVAN: No. Shut up.
FOGELL: ( to Seth ) So, where's all the stolen liquor?
SETH: Fuck you! I was gonna do it, but security was tight as shit. I was gonna do it though, don't think I wasn't. Let's go to the liquor store and try your stupid ID.
FOGELL: Wait! I'm gonna put my vest back in my
EVAN: Well, here we are. Fogell, are you ready?
SETH: Here's the list.
FOGELL: A list? Why?
SETH: We're getting girls their booze so they'll get with us. I put a lot of thought into that list. It's the perfect party bar, so don't mess it up and get Sambuca again.
FOGELL: Ouzo, Drambuie, Jager, Gold-shlay-ger-
EVAN: Goldschlager. That's for Helen, so do not forget it.
FOGELL: -Alize, Captain Morgan Rum, Smirnoff Rasberry and a big ass bottle of Popov-
SETH: Oh yeah, and Mike's Hard Lemonade.
FOGELL: This is too much. I can't get away with this much!
EVAN: What's the difference?
FOGELL: I don't know, man. I'm getting, like, really nervous.
EVAN: Are you okay?
SETH: What the hell are you doing?
FOGELL: I don't know if I want to do this.
SETH: What are you talking about? You just promised you would. What is this shit?
FOGELL: What if they turn me down?
SETH: Then we're in the same place that we're in right now!
FOGELL: It's fucking humiliating! Everyone in the store sees them kicking me out. What if they make me put all the liquor back on the shelf? I can't do that!
SETH: This whole thing is bigger than you, asshead! Just go in there and buy the damn alcohol!
FOGELL: What if I don't feel like it anymore?
SETH: Then I will kill you! How's that? If you don't buy the alcohol, I will kill you!
FOGELL: Killing me won't get you any alcohol, jerkoff! I'm the one with the ID!
SETH: Then I will kill you, cut off your ugly face, put it over mine, and buy it my fucking self.
FOGELL: You don't have the technology or the steady hands to pull off a procedure like
EVAN: Seth, calm down! Fogell, stop being a baby and go buy the alcohol! You said you'd do it, so do it. It's why you bought the ID, so just go do it.

FOGELL: I think I would know, thank you.
CASHIER: Um, yes, may I please see some ID?
CASHIER: Anyone who looks under thirty-five.
SETH: It's a good ID, right? Mike Snider never had a problem. It's fine. Right?
EVAN: Calm down. Did you remember a condom?
SETH: You brought a condom?
EVAN: Yeah, I figured, you know, might as well. I brought one of those little things of spermicidal lube too.
SETH: You asshole! You laughed in my face when I said we'd be having sex tonight.
EVAN: It doesn't mean you shouldn't be prepared. You didn't even bring one?
SETH: No. That wasn't the plan! We had a plan! I can't believe you did that without even consulting me about it!
EVAN: I don't really even understand what your plan is.
SETH: I'm gonna go down on her for, like, hours. She'll love that. She'll want to go out with that.
EVAN: Yeah, but I figured there's no harm in bringing just one little condom.
SETH: And one little bottle of spermicidal lube. That's nuts. You can't let her know you brought that! These girls are 18, not dried up old ladies. They're ready to go.
EVAN: Fine. I won't bring the lube.
FOGELL: ( reading name tag )
CASHIER: Umm, okay sir, I'm gonna need to see some

CASHIER: ( breathing hard ) I don't believe it.I don't believe
EVAN: That was a waste.
SETH: But she fully looked way better before. I thought when they reduced them, they just kind of reshaped them nicer. Made them more supple.
EVAN: I can't even begin to imagine the justification for making breasts smaller.
SETH: It's like me making my nuts saggier.
EVAN: Whoa. What's this?
SETH: ( CONTINUED )
EVAN: Check it out! The cops!
OFFICER SLATER: ( to cashier ) So, did he punch anyone else?
CASHIER: ( losing it completely ) I can't do this, okay!?! I told you, I have an exam tomorrow! Can you understand that? A goddamn exam!

SETH: That doesn't matter anymore. I just lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money!
EVAN: We have to help him!
SETH: Help him? What are we gonna do? Bust him out of jail? I don't even know where jail is! What we need is the alcohol, which is impossible because we don't have any fucking money!
EVAN: Fine. Just.calm down. We need to think. We need to think.
SETH: Fuck thinking! We need to act!
OFFICER SLATER: Okay, your name is just McLovin, there's no need to get irrational.
OFFICER MICHAELS: A lot of people have strange names these I once arrested a man-lady who was legally named "Pearl Necklace."
OFFICER SLATER: I once arrested a man-lady who was legally named "Pearl Necklace."
FOGELL: It's just. I changed my name. I was going to be a singer. R&B.
OFFICER MICHAELS: Fine. That's not illegal.
OFFICER SLATER: And, how old are you McLovin?
FOGELL: Old enough.
OFFICER SLATER: Old enough for what?
OFFICER MICHAELS: Can I see your ID?
FOGELL: Fogell takes his shaking, sweaty hand, sticks it in his pocket, and pulls out his fake ID. He slowly hands it over to Officer Slater. The cops both look at it, then Fogell. Beads of sweat are running down Fogell's face. In the background, Seth pops up and starts kicking the guy's car out of anger. Evan and the driver both restrain Seth.
OFFICER SLATER: You're an organ donor?
FOGELL: OFFICER SLATER OFFICER MICHAELS
OFFICER SLATER: I didn't want to be one but my wife Just like a woman. Even after you're dead, they want to tear your heart out.

DRIVER: ( beat ) Fine. Just take it.
SETH: What is this? This isn't enough.
DRIVER: It's all I have.
SETH: Well, you just came from the liquor store, give us your liquor.
DRIVER: I didn't get any. They're not letting anyone in. They're arresting someone or Well, they'll be arresting somebody else if you don't do something quick. Ow! My shoulder! It's killing me.

SETH: You better.
EVAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Come here.
SETH: What? Jules' money is gone, Fogell's out, we've got no other option. Let's go.
EVAN: I don't..I don't like this idea at all. I'm just not feeling it. That guy's fucking creepy. Just look at him.
DRIVER: ( to Evan ) You know a guy named Jimmy, perchance? Cause you totally look like his brother.
SETH: He's an idiot. And he's our only hope. Come on, don't break your promise to
OFFICER SLATER: ( to Fogell ) Man, that lady just wouldn't stop crying, huh? And you're the one that got punched. Did you hear her say she has an exam tomorrow? Boo-fuckin'-hoo. Am I right?
FOGELL: ( afraid ) Heh. Good one.
OFFICER MICHEALS: Could we have taken her in? Just to scare the shit out of her?
OFFICER SLATER: Hah. Probably could have found a way. But a good general rule is only take people in you want to ride with. And whiny bitches don't make that cut.
DRIVER: One of you bros could have sat up here with me.
SETH: Seth fishes his cell phone out of his pocket and looks at it.
DRIVER: Who is it?
JULES: Seth! Where are you?
SETH: Jules! I just got in a cab and I'm going to the liquor store as we speak.
JULES: Awesome. I can't wait for you to get

JULES: Yeah. It looks like it could actually be a great party. I think, like, tons of people might show up. I hope they don't trash my house.
SETH: Well, if they want to do that they're going to have to get through me.
JULES: So I guess I don't have to worry then. I'll see you soon.
SETH: She called, man! That's insane! She's practically begging for it. She said, "I can't wait for you to get here."
DRIVER: That sounds like she fully wants it. Where's she gonna get it from, huh, my
EVAN: Hey, are you sure that it's cool we're Oh, definitely. I'm essentially best friends with this guy. A whole bunch of my buddies are coming. Come on!
DRIVER: Oh, definitely. I'm essentially best friends with this guy. A whole bunch of my buddies are coming. Come on!
EVAN: This is weird.
SETH: Whatever. Just act casual. And old. All we gotta do is find the booze and haul ass out of here.
SETH: Holy shit! Let's grab one of these buckets and go.
MARK: You calling more of your stupid friends again? Ya prick.
DRIVER: Mark, calm down, okay? Just relax.
MARK: Get the fuck out of my house.

EVAN: Dude, let's slip out the back.
SETH: Why? Come on, we're here. Let's just hurry up and do this.
EVAN: You want to end up like that guy? Not me, I need my nuts.
SETH: We need this liquor!
EVAN: You need it! I don't need it. I'm going to tell Helen I like her, and then maybe she'll get with me; not after I get her stinking drunk.
SETH: Then why haven't you ever made a move, you pussy?
EVAN: Because I respect her! I'm not going to put that kind of unfair pressure on her.
SETH: These aren't girls, they're women! They need our dicks as much as we need their poons - and we all love liquor, so where's the fucking beef?!
EVAN: We're leaving, okay? These guys could kill us. You want to get killed for You're really gonna bail on me?!
SETH: You're really gonna bail on me?!
EVAN: ( rolls eyes )
SETH: Okay, okay.if that's how you're going to be, then I'll get the booze on my own. And you're not getting any. And neither is Helen!
FOGELL: Um.hey.uh, officers. I could answer those, uh, questions now if you want.
OFFICER SLATER: We get the gist of it. You were buying some beer, some guys came in and robbed the place. I don't think we're gonna find `em this time.
FOGELL: It was only one guy.
OFFICER SLATER: Only one guy? Well, fuck that. We could never catch one guy.
OFFICER MICHAELS: You see, McLovin, if it was two guys, we'd have twice the chance of catching one of them. But just one guy? I mean, how are we supposed to find one guy in this whole city?
OFFICER SLATER: Yeah, McLovin. You know how many people there are in this city? I have trouble finding people I know.
FOGELL: Aren't you guys supposed to be trained or something? Don't you have a computer?
OFFICER SLATER: Yeah, that stuff can help, but if someone walks up to me on the street, and is like, "Hey, find Bob." Well, how the hell am I supposed to do that?
FOGELL: Who's Bob?
OFFICER SLATER: Exactly. If I don't know who he is, then how am I supposed to know where he is?
OFFICER MICHAELS: When you're new to the force, like I am-
OFFICER SLATER: Only six months in. I got two and a half years under my belt.

OFFICER MICHAELS: So I pull up in front of her house and she asks me to come inside for some coffee. Of course, I say yes.
OFFICER SLATER: Oh shit.
OFFICER MICHAELS: Oh shit. So we go into the kitchen. I start taking off my clothes, she fucking flips, starts screaming at me, and I'm like "Can't have coffee without cream." Oh!!! Right? I fucking said that. Then, she slaps me, throws me out. I'm telling you McLovin, stay out of bars.
FOGELL: Hey, you don't need to tell me.
OFFICER MICHAELS: So, yeah, you gotta look in different places. The gym, an art class, you know, shit like that.
OFFICER SLATER: I met the Missus at paint ball. Can you believe that? I shot her in the neck, and we just hit it off. And my first wife who is a whore where do you think we met? A bar.

SETH: It is bailing, if you promised to burn your dick off!

OFFICER MICHAELS: What? Oh, yeah, the guy was fine.
OFFICER MICHEALS: I'm sorry, McLovin. But I really need this to be a private thing.
FOGELL: ( coughing ) Umm, yeah, sure. You guys are great.
OFFICER MICHAELS: Yeah, well, we're also on probation. You see, we've actually trashed two other cars. The first time wasn't our fault, and the second time a bee flew in and I freaked out. Point is, we trash another car, without a good reason, we're fucked. Know what I'm saying?
FOGELL: OFFICER MICHAELS
OFFICER MICHAELS: Now, we're going to arrest these guys, and if you don't mind, which you shouldn't, we'd like you to write a fake witness report saying they jumped out in front of our car. Cool, McLovin?
OFFICER SLATER: How tall are you?
EVAN: Uh.I don't know, five-foot-ten, eleven?
OFFICER SLATER: And you said those were "Pumas?"
OFFICER MICHAELS: The cops run after Evan! Seth and Fogell look at each other. Seth grabs the remaining detergent jug and runs off in the opposite direction of Evan! Fogell reaches into the cop car, grabs the bags of booze, and follows Seth.
FOGELL: Seth! Wait up!
OFFICER SLATER: Shit! Shit! McLovin bailed!
OFFICER SLATER: EXT. STREET WITH COP CAR - CONTINUOUS 107 107 The cops get out of the car and run off after Seth and Fogell. As they run, we see the Homeless Guy slump out of the car, landing on his face with a muffled groan. He stands up, grabs the jug of detergent that was left on the ground, and runs off.
KIDS: ( hysterical ) Help/ It's a monster!/ Daddy!

SETH: Seth manages to free himself from the tent and he and Fogell fall to the ground. The kids continue to scream.
FOGELL: Fogell starts banging as Seth looks back to see the Dad coming for them. Seth swings the detergent jug at the Father, knocking him on his ass. He quickly gets up and charges, 109 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 109 Fogell gets the door open and the two boys run into the EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 110 110 They sprint down the alley. Seth coughs and wheezes, slowing down as he lugs the detergent. The Father enters the alley and sees the boys running. He throws his baseball bat. It sails through the air and nails Seth in the back! He falls.
SETH: He gets up and the keeps running.

BECCA: It was something like, "I'll fully blow him tonight."
EVAN: Evan looks over and sees Helen standing on the balcony with a big group of people. He gets really nervous.
BECCA: Well, Jordana stole a bottle of tequila from her parents and her and Helen have been going at it. I think she'll be fine in that department. I'd just go over there and invite her upstairs, pronto.
EVAN: What? Oh man. But.she's totally hammered. If I get with her, and I'm not drunk, isn't that, like, date rape?
