MANIAC!!!: DAD looks horrified as he politely maneuvers his way through crowd as CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE take over and begin "slamming" their way through crowd opening up a crowd for DAD. The COPS flood the place. DET. MOORE sees MOM in the distance, grabs DET. BRADFORD and they begin to fight their way through crowd after her. "CAMEL LIPS" incites the crowd from the stage to fight back against the police. SCOTTY is running toward stage in terror, looking over his shoulder and seeing MOM gaining on him. DAD gets caught in a mob of slam dancers and is lifted off his feet and tossed through the air by the crowd. MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE see DAD airborne and start slamming into the crowd to save him. MISTY and CHIP slam into big BIKER below DAD and DAD is knocked back to the ground safely. When BIRDIE sees a slam dancer with a trickle of blood running from his nose, she starts gagging at the sight of real blood. SCOTTY is at the edge of the stage. He sees MOM almost on top of him and leaps onto stage and runs for his life, dodging bouncers and beer bottles being thrown from audience. MOM looks furious that SCOTTY has escaped but then looks up at theatrical light rigging overhead and then back down at SCOTTY's face as "CAMEL LIPS" tries to hit him with their instruments. MOM looks over her shoulder and sees DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD advancing on her. Ducking behind a giant speaker, out of view of the crowd MOM pulls butcher knife from purse, cuts supporting rope and sends whole set of lights crashing down on SCOTTY's head. The crowd goes wild thinking it's more of "CAMEL LIPS" sickening theatrics. A gang of heavy-metal chicks slam into DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD and knock them to the ground. MOM's eyes light up in fury when she sees SCOTTY still alive, crawling out from under the lights, semi-conscious and bleeding. BIRDIE faints at the sight of more blood. Thinking fast, MOM swipes a hairspray can sticking out of a girl's purse and uses her VIP pass to go backstage as CAMEL LIPS reaches its deafening crescendo of musical mayhem. As SCOTTY crawls to side of stage, MOM jumps out from a piece of backstage scenery and aims hairspray can at him.
MOM: ( Hissing ) Buckle up, Scotty!
