EPISODE VII: THE FORCE AWAKENS
POE: Well, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time.
POE: BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San
POE: You have to hide.
POE: Come on, BB-8! Hurry! Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat he moves to the cockpit the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES
POE: You take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me? ( BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates ) I'll come back for you! It will be BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers from cover.
SENIOR TROOPER: Stay here. Our Trooper nods. Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.
KYLO REN: Look how old you've become.
KYLO REN: You know what I've come for.
KYLO REN: The map to Skywalker. We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order. Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame sees the Ren/San Tekka exchange continue.
KYLO REN: I'll show you the dark side.
KYLO REN: You're so right. And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA! Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES AT KYLO REN! Instantly: Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND POE'S BLAST FREEZES THE BOLT
POE: So who talks first? You talk first?
KYLO REN: The old man gave it to you.
POE: ( INDICATES KYLO'S MASK )
MASK ): It's just very hard to understand you with all the.
KYLO REN: ( TO TROOPERS )
POE: . Apparatus. The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer. Poe just glares as the pat down ends.
STORMTROOPER #1: Nothing, sir.
KYLO REN: Put him on board. Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK-
CAPTAIN PHASMA: Sir, the villagers.
KYLO REN: Kill them all. Phasma nods, steps forward:
CAPTAIN PHASMA: On my command! The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers.
STORMTROOPER #2: Nothing here. Go ahead! Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION.
POE: All right. All right! Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast:
CAPTAIN PHASMA: FN-2187. Submit your blaster for Yes, Captain.
CAPTAIN PHASMA: And who gave you permission to remove that helmet?
CAPTAIN PHASMA: Report to my division at once.
UNKAR: What you've brought me today is worth. Hmmm. One quarter Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks. Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET: DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another. She takes it. She swallows her resentment and heads off.
REY: Tal'ama parqual! The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.
STRAIGHTENS THE: ANTENNA )
ANTENNA ): Where do you come from?
KYLO REN: I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Through battered lips:
POE: Not really.
KYLO REN: I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map.
POE: Might wanna rethink your technique. Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence
KYLO REN: Where is it?
POE: The Resistance will not be intimidated by you.
KYLO REN: Where. is it? Poe can't take it he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO:
KYLO REN: It's in a droid. A BB unit.
GENERAL HUX: Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it.
KYLO REN: I leave that to you.
REY: Don't give up. He still might show up. Whoever it is you're waiting for. Classified. I know all about BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question.
UNKAR: These five pieces are worth. Let me see here. One half portion.
REY: ( OBJECTS )
UNKAR: What about the droid?
REY: What about him?
UNKAR: I'll pay for him. BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious.
REY: Actually. the droid's not for sale.
UNKAR: Follow the girl and get that droid. He SLAMS the service window door SHUT.
STORMTROOPER: Ren wants the prisoner. TIGHT ON POE, in pain, drained, as the Guard unshackles him.
STORMTROOPER: Turn here. Poe turns into a narrow passageway
STORMTROOPER: Listen carefully: you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here.
POE: ( COMING TO )
POE: You with the Resistance?!
POE: I can fly anything. Why, why are you helping me?
POE: ( it hits him ) You need a pilot.
POE: We're gonna do this.
POE: I am calm.
POE: I always wanted to fly one of these things. Can ya shoot?
POE: Okay, same principal! Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons, and mag pulse use the site on the right to aim, triggers to fire!
POE: I can fix this.
ROOM!: INT. HANGAR SIX CONTROL ROOM - DAY THE WINDOWS ARE BLOWN IN BY LASER BLASTS! INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY
POE: I got it!
POE: Woooahhh! This thing really moves. All right, we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far!
POE: I'm gonna get us in position, just stay sharp!
POE: Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it? I've got us dead centered. It's a clean shot.
THAT?: I saw it! Hey, what's your name?
POE: I saw it! Hey, what's your name?
POE: That's the only name they ever gave Well I ain't using it! FN, huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right? Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile.
POE: Well I ain't using it! FN, huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right? Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile.
FINN: "Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that! I like that!
POE: I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.
FINN: Good to meet you, Poe!
POE: Good to meet you too, Finn!
LIEUTENANT MITAKA: Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers
GENERAL HUX: Use the ventral cannons.
LIEUTENANT MITAKA: Yes, sir. Bringing them online
GENERAL HUX: Yes, and he had help.
KYLO REN: . The one from the village. FN-
LIEUTENANT MITAKA: Sir. Ventral cannons hot.
GENERAL HUX: EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY Massive WARHEAD LAUNCHERS SPIN and FIRE BLASTS toward the TIE fighter, which flies EVASIVE MANEUVERS most blasts hit the DEBRIS from the TURBOLASER DESTRUCTION. The TIE fighter then PULLS A BIG TURN, BACK TOWARD JAKKU,
POE: One's coming towards you. My right, your left. Do you see it?
FINN: Hold on! I see it!
POE: Nice shot. Finn looks up suddenly in alarm
FINN: Where are you going?
POE: We're going back to Jakku. That's No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! NEAR-MISS LASER BLASTS as Poe pilots aggressively.
FINN: No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! NEAR-MISS LASER BLASTS as Poe pilots aggressively.
POE: I got to get to my droid before the First Order does!
FINN: What - a droid?!
POE: That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind.
FINN: I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important!
POE: This one is, pal.
FINN: We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die!
POE: That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker!
FINN: Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I Suddenly BAM! THEY ARE HIT!
CAPTAIN PHASMA: FN-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to Reconditioning.
GENERAL HUX: No prior signs of non-conformity?
CAPTAIN PHASMA: This was his first offense. A technician checks her readings, reports to General Hux.
TECHNICIAN #1: General. They've been hit.
GENERAL HUX: TECHNICIAN #1 ( GETTING READINGS )
TECHNICIAN #1: ( GETTING READINGS )
GENERAL HUX: They were going back for the droid send a squad to the wreckage.
FINN: Poe! Poe! Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER, SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he sees POE'S ARM he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET. He throws that off and tries to find a way in even a way to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible.
POE!!! POE!!!: It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A few moments and IT'S GONE. Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE! Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated. And all alone.
GENERAL HUX: Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must.
KYLO REN: How capable are your soldiers, I won't have you question my methods.
GENERAL HUX: ( WITH VITRIOL )
KYLO REN: They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.
GENERAL HUX: ( YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH )
KYLO REN: Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed.
GENERAL HUX: Careful, Ren. That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.
KYLO REN: I want that map. For your sake, I suggest you get it. Ren heads off. Hux hates him.
FINN: Water. water. water.. He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like creature ( a HAPPABORE ) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.
REY: ( To BB-8 ) Who? Him? Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant. Finn can feel trouble coming and Rey begins CHARGING AT HIM, quarterstaff in hand. Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN away from her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him he turns a corner then another then BAM! She's got ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF! Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She holds the staff on him threateningly:
REY: What's your hurry, thief?
FINN: What?! Thief? BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES
REY: The jacket! This droid says you stole it!
FINN: I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me OW!!! ( BB-8 has ZAPPED him
AGAIN ): STOP IT! Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master. Finn looks at her then the agitated droid, Finn's mind racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard decision: to tell the truth.

FINN: It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.
REY: So you're with the Resistance?
FINN: Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah.
REY: I've never met a Resistance fighter Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different.
FINN: Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different.
REY: BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base.
FINN: Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:
REY: Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.
FINN: Come on! Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT, SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS MORE BLASTS as they run!
FINN: Come on, BB-8!
REY: Let go of me!
FINN: No, we gotta move!
REY: ( pulls her hand back ) I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey ANOTHER BLAST just missing them! They disappear through a tent. TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.
STORMTROOPER: Call in the air strike! REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent:
REY: They're shooting at both of us!
FINN: Yeah, they saw you with me! You're Well, thanks for that!
REY: Well, thanks for that!
FINN: I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?!
REY: ( TO BB-8 )
REY: As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog:
FINN: Are you okay? And that very question touches her having never in her life been asked it.
REY: ( extends her hand ) Follow me. Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off. LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB-
FINN: We can't outrun them! Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead:
REY: We might in that quad-jumper!
FINN: We need a pilot!
REY: We've got one!
FINN: ( then, indicates one
REY: That one's garbage! They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA:
REY: Gunner position's down there!
FINN: ( CLIMBS DOWN )
REY: No! This ship hasn't been flown in INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY Finn buckles into the gunner seat to his shock the SEAT WHIPS TO THE LEFT, startling him he grabs the controls to steady himself.
FINN: ( reacts to seat ) Whoa! I can do this, I can do this
REY: I can do this, I can do this Rey pulls the yoke:
UNKAR: HEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!! The Falcon BLASTS AWAY, two TIE FIGHTERS chase it, fast!
FINN: Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls THE FALCON CANTS!
REY: Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls THE FALCON CANTS!
WHAT?: Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls THE FALCON CANTS!
FINN: Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls THE FALCON CANTS!
REY: BB-8, hold on! Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke, stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move.
REY: I'M GOING LOW!!! EXT. DESERT - DAY BEHIND THE FALCON as it DRAMATICALLY BANKS AT AN UPWARD ARC, UPSIDE-DOWN, then SWOOPS PERILOUSLY LOW across the sand. Two TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM past us!
REY: What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?! Finn flicks switches The GUN TARGETING LIGHTS UP:
FINN: I'm working on it! Are the shields Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat.
REY: Not so easy without a co-pilot! Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR:
FINN: Try sitting in this thing! Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS!
FINN: We need cover, quick!
REY: We're about to get some!
FINN: Damn it! Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard.
FINN: Come on. come on. HITS AND SHATTERS the TIE FIGHTER!
REY: Nice shot!
FINN: I'm getting pretty good at this!
ALARMS BLARE: The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em!
FINN: The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em!
REY: Get ready!
FINN: Okay! For what?
FINN: ARE WE REALLY DOING THIS?! INT. WRECKED SUPER STAR DESTROYER - DAY The two ships slalom debris inside the giant ship the Falcon GRAZING ONE SIDE, THEN THE OTHER, SPITTING SPARKS!
REY: Oh no! Just as the TIE PILOT GETS A LOCK, Rey YANKS THE YOKE
DESTROYING IT!: REY GUNS THE ENGINES again, FLIPS THE FALCON and FLIES AWAY as the TIE FIGHTER CRASHES!
FINN: The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard and disappearing into the clouds.
FINN: Finn. What's yours.
REY: I'm Rey. BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile.
FINN: But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge, STEAM BURSTS from under the grating.
REY: Help me with this! Quick! They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls over, watches.
FINN: Whoa! What's going on? She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern.
LIEUTENANT MITAKA: Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing.
KYLO REN: The droid. stole a freighter?
LIEUTENANT MITAKA: Not exactly, sir. It had help. Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats.
KYLO REN: Anything else? Mitaka hates to say the following, but:
LIEUTENANT MITAKA: The two were accompanied by a girl. Ren reaches out Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD REN, into his black glove:
KYLO REN: What girl?
REY: It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench check in there! As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below, overwhelmed by the technical issues
FINN: How bad is it?!
REY: If we wanna live, not good! BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS:
FINN: They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench.
REY: BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" if I'm taking you there, I need to ( Throws a tool ) She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8 alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently:
FINN: ( Throws a tool ) She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8 alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently:
REY: Pilex driver, hurry! Finn moves for the tool.
FINN: ( searching, to BB-8 ) Go on BB-8, tell her.
REY: The Ileenium system? Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled Rey disappears below again.
FINN: Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one get us there as fast as you can. A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it.
REY: I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry!
FINN: ( searching for tape ) What about you?
REY: I gotta get back to Jakku!
FINN: ( loses his mind ) BACK TO JAK?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! !
REY: No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! Bb-8 has moved to Finn TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool. He throws her the tape, she disappears below:
FINN: Hey. Rey. You're a pilot you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed:
REY: Hey. Rey. You're a pilot you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed:
FINN: Hey. Rey. You're a pilot you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed:
REY: None of your business, THAT'S WHY! But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous.
FINN: . That can't be good.
REY: ( HEADS OFF )
REY: Someone's locked onto us all controls are overridden. Finn quickly, awkwardly climbs up, looks out.
FINN: . Oh no.
FINN: It's the First Order.
REY: What do we do there must be
SOMETHING: Finn's mind races then:
FINN: You said poisonous gas
REY: Yeah, but I fixed that
FINN: Can you unfix it? Rey stares at him and gets his plan! They head off
REY: C'mon BB-8. They help BB-8 down, too: they both struggle like crazy, he weighs a TON.
FINN: I got it.
REY: I'm okay. BB-8 get off me.
FINN: I'm okay. BB-8 get off me.
REY: You think this'll work on the Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins. LIGHTS COME ON! SOUND of the SHIP RAMP LOWERING! Finn PULLS THE GRATING CLOSED as he says:
FINN: Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins. LIGHTS COME ON! SOUND of the SHIP RAMP LOWERING! Finn PULLS THE GRATING CLOSED as he says:
REY: I'm hurrying! Suddenly the FALCON DOOR OPENS AND HAN SOLO AND CHEWBACCA BOARD THE FALCON, weapons at the ready. PUSH IN ON THEM, ready for combat, operating silently, with hand signals only.
HAN: Chewie, we're home. Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads off one way, Han in another. The grating above LIFTS OFF hands in surrender, they look up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening. They're SCARED.
REY: .I'm the pilot.
HAN: Chewie MOAN-TALKS. Rey responds to him
REY: No, it's true: we're the only ones on board.
FINN: You can understand that thing?
HAN: And "that thing" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta They climb up BB-8 uses his magnetic arm to quickly pull himself out.
REY: Niima Outpost.
HAN: Jakku?! That junkyard?
FINN: Thank you! Junkyard!
HAN: ( TO CHEWIE )
REY: I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain.
HAN: Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good. Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles. Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit.
REY: This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo?
HAN: I used to be.
FINN: Han Solo? The Rebellion General?
REY: No, the smuggler!
FINN: ( TO CHEWIE )
REY: This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs.!
HAN: Twelve! Fourteen. A moment of private joy. Then he sees something that ANNOYS
REY: Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on
THE HYPERDRIVE: ( OVERLAPPING HER )
HAN: ( OVERLAPPING HER )
REY: Wait! No we need your help!
HAN: My help?
REY: This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible!
FINN: He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. Yup: Han stops in his tracks.
HAN: Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK!
LOOSE: Han hurries out they all follow, ( Chewie, Rey, Finn, then BB-8 ), Finn with WILD CONCERN:
FINN: Wait a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey!
FINN: You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?
HAN: I'm hauling Rathtars. On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful.
REY: What's a Rathtar?
FINN: Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?!
REY: They turn a corner:
FINN: They turn a corner:
HAN: I got three of 'em going to King THREE?! How'd you get them on board?
FINN: THREE?! How'd you get them on board?
HAN: I used to have a bigger crew. Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring.
HAN: Get below deck and stay there until I say so don't even think about taking the Falcon.
REY: What about BB-8?
HAN: He stays with me until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way.
FINN: What about the Rathtars. where are you keeping them? A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart There's one.
HAN: There's one.
REY: What are you gonna do?
HAN: Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it.
HAN: Bala-Tik. What's the problem?
REY: Can you see them?
FINN: They start crawling down the crawl space.
HAN: You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER:
REY: They have blasters.
FINN: A lot of 'em. We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company in the distance.
HAN: Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money.
HAN: I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!
HAN: Tasu Leech. Good to see you. Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:
TASU LEECH: Wrong again, Solo. It's over for Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous. Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang start CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them.
HAN: Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before?
TASU LEECH: Han realizes he's right.
HAN: What was the second time?
TASU LEECH: Nowhere left for you to hide.
HAN: First I've heard of it. Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid. Above, another Kanjiklubber ( RAZOO QIN-FEE ) says ( SUBTITLED ):
REY: Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs!
FINN: Close the blast doors from here?
REY: Resetting the fuses should do it. Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as they do. Finn quickly joins in. Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too. DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN and a GIANT RATHTAR an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS
HAN: . I got a bad feeling about this. Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN even down below, where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned.
REY: Oh no.
FINN: Oh no, what?
REY: ( PALE )
FINN: This was a mistake!
REY: INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY Two Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship passing Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the corridor who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way. Other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction they all turn a corner a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF and we land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. Rey and Finn climb out, They turn a corridor
REY: What do they look like?
FINN: They look like that. Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner a
REY: Are you sure? They scream and run off but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY
FAST!: REY ( CONT'D )
FINN!: But the Rathtar's fast and TURNS A CORNER, losing Rey
FINN: INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR E - DAY TIGHT ON FINN as he's being yanked down the hall, SCREAMING as he struggles to get loose! Rey turns the corner Finn is gone nowhere to be seen.
REY!: INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR E - DAY TIGHT ON FINN as he's being yanked down the hall, SCREAMING as he struggles to get loose! Rey turns the corner Finn is gone nowhere to be seen.
REY: Without Finn, she is instantly distraught then she realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits. then
FINN!!!!: Without Finn, she is instantly distraught then she realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits. then
REY: It had me! But the door!
FINN: It had me! But the door!
REY: That was lucky! ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon.
HAN: I got the door. Cover us! Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls. THE HATCH OPENS ( FALCON in the distance ) just as CHEWIE IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a
LOUD GROAN!: HAN ( CONT'D )
BADASS!: HAN ( CONT'D )
REY: Finn and Rey race past BB-8 as they go up the ramp, Han says to Rey:
HAN: You, close the door behind us!
HAN: Hey, where are you going?
REY: Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere.
HAN: I hate that guy. Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons:
REY: And you could use a co-pilot.
HAN: I got one, he's back there.
HAN: Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed
REY: ( SHOCKED )
HAN: I never ask that question until after I've done it. A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD REY SCREAMS! Its GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls:
FINN: ( HUGE PROBLEM )
HAN: Come on baby, don't let me down! He hits a switch but NOTHING.
REY: Han doesn't like it but she's right he hits the switch again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO:
SNOKE: . Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise.
GENERAL HUX: Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th
SNOKE: General! Our strategy must now The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:

Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:
SNOKE: Go. Oversee preparations.
GENERAL HUX: Yes, Supreme Leader. General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice.
SNOKE: There's been an awakening. Have you felt it?
KYLO REN: There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo. Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise.
SNOKE: There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo. Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise.
KYLO REN: He means nothing to me.
SNOKE: Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test.
KYLO REN: ( STEELY RESOLVE )
SNOKE: We shall see. We shall see. A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed, filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque evil SMILE growing as he DISINTEGRATES Snoke has been a HOLOGRAM all along.
SPARKS!: Electrical overload!
HAN: Electrical overload!
REY: I can fix that!
HAN: The coolant's leaking!
REY: Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank
HAN: Secondary tank, I got it!
FINN: Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! INT. FALCON COCKPIT: You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!
HAN: You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!
FINN: Hurt him?! He almost killed me six ( Chewie GRABS HIM by the collar, ROARS ) Which is fine.
HAN: This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied, sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused.
REY: I by-passed the compressor. He looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits, walking past BB-8.
HAN: Move, Ball.
HAN: Nah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest. Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it:
FINN: You're welcome. Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to turn it off.
HAN: So, fugitives, huh?
REY: The First Order wants the map.
HAN: Let's see whatcha got.
REY: ( TO BB-8 )
HAN: This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him.
REY: Why'd he leave?
HAN: He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible. He walked away from everything.
FINN: Do you know what happened to him?
HAN: There're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.
REY: The Jedi were real?
HAN: I used to wonder that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light.
REY: ( QUIETLY )
FINN: Hey, Solo I'm not sure what we're walking into here
HAN: D'you just call me "Solo"?
FINN: Sorry. Han Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Hands him a BLASTER.
HAN: Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Hands him a BLASTER.
HAN: You might need this.
REY: I think I can handle myself.
HAN: I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. Rey picks it up. Grips it.
REY: Yeah, you pull the trigger.
HAN: There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name?
REY: Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon.
HAN: Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon.
REY: Are you offering me a job?
HAN: I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much.
REY: You're offering me a job.
HAN: I'm thinking about it. Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she can't cross.
REY: If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. Han looks at her, questioningly.
HAN: Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku.
REY: ( BEAT )
HAN: ( TO CHEWIE )
FINN: Solo, why are we here again?
HAN: To get your droid on a clean ship.
REY: ( CONTINUED )
HAN: Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet.
FINN: We can trust her, right?
HAN: Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare.
HAN: Any of it. The door opens. Music. Madness. And.
MAZ: Han Solo! Everyone turns to look. It's ALL QUIET in here.
HAN: ( Sotto ) Oh boy. ( Louder, waving ) Hey, Maz! NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away.
MAZ: Where's my boyfriend?
HAN: Chewie's working on the Falcon.
MAZ: I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it.
BAZINE: Inform the First Order. I've found the droid.
KYLO REN: Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started. As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off we FOLLOW HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT,
MAZ: A map to Skywalker himself? You're right back in the mess.
HAN: Maz, I need you to get this droid to Hmm. No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home!
MAZ: Hmm. No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home!
HAN: Leia doesn't want to see me.
FINN: Please, we came here for your help.
REY: What fight?
MAZ: The only fight: against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us.
FINN: There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him her eyes get HUGE.
HAN: I don't know, but it ain't good.
MAZ: If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run.
FINN: ( eyes on Maz ) You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen.
MAZ: You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear. Finn sees them. Considers.
REY: Come with me.
FINN: Come with me.
REY: What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base.
FINN: I can't. Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.
HAN: Keep it, kid. Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han.
MAZ: Who's the girl?
ON FINN: Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS.
FINN: I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.
REY: What are you doing? Finn gets up to talk to her.
FINN: ( to Big Head ) Don't leave without me.
REY: You can't just go. I won't let you.
FINN: I'm not who you think I am.
REY: Finn, what are you talking about?
FINN: I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper.
REY: Don't go.
FINN: Take care of yourself. Please. Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey watches Finn return to the aliens. And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks through it. Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked back at her one last time.
YOUNG GIRL: She stands looks around, confused by all she sees and hears. Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY. We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all TILTS TURNS and she lands on the WALL which is now the GROUND dried GRASS. She turns to look we PIVOT and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT NIGHT. We PAN to: R2-D2 who watches the flames and a MAN appears ( LUKE, whose face we do not see ). He falls to his knees, reaches out to the droid with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND. We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT and she LOOKS UP we TILT UP To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground we FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him! Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and SUNLIGHT illuminates her she turns to look we PIVOT and see. A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical. Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku, watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.
NO!: She stands looks around, confused by all she sees and hears. Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY.

YOUNG GIRL: No, come back!
UNKAR PLUTT: Quiet, girl! The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around her to see she is.. In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind, confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath seen in the frigid air and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound. Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:
REY: What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there.
MAZ: That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him and now, it calls to you! Rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless.
REY: I have to get back to Jakku.
MAZ: Han told me. ( reaches out, hold
REY: The belonging you seek is not behind you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.
MAZ: The belonging you seek is not behind you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.
REY: I'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this. And Rey runs off, passing Maz. Rey's mind is spinning she can't take it she turns and heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.
GENERAL HUX: Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this. as the last day of the INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY ENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL. There's a sense of nervousness WILL THIS MASSIVE WEAPON ACTUALLY WORK?
GENERAL HUX: And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE a ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!
FIRE!: And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE a ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!
REY: What are you doing?
MAZ: I've had this for ages.
MAZ: Kept it locked away.
HAN: Where'd you get that?
MAZ: A good question for another time.
STORMTROOPER: FN-417, hold position! Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER but IT WON'T FIRE! She panics, then realizes:
REY: SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS and retreats, calls to BB-8: BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more chasing Troopers!
STORMTROOPER #4: Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl. Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction
REY: You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. ( BB-8 BEEPS; bravely through her fear ) I hope so, too. BB-8 BEEPS and heads off Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE
HAN: Come on, Chewie! Maz turns to Finn:
MAZ: Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now I need a weapon. Maz grabs his wrist holds up his hand THE SABER.
FINN: I need a weapon. Maz grabs his wrist holds up his hand THE SABER.
MAZ: You have one! He looks at her questioningly he's supposed to use the lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON. HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at Stormtroopers, taking some out!
HAN: Hey, can I try that? Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers and sends them flying.
STORMTROOPER: FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him, when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS! Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast! Han helps him up.
HAN: You okay, Big deal?
FINN: But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED.
STORMTROOPER: Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody!
HAN: It's the Resistance. One X-WING in particular MARKED IN BLACK SWOOPS DOWN and takes out the parked TIE FIGHTERS and Troopers!
POE: Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you!
HAN: Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. Shoots a Trooper.
FINN: Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY EXT. FOREST - DAY In the darkened woods, Rey, terrified, keeps her blaster aimed. Her eyes dart around for her pursuer. And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER COMING TO LIFE A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK. Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now. Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree Rey FIRES again and again Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO

KYLO REN: The girl I've heard so much about. He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry.
STORMTROOPER: Request air support!
KYLO REN: The map. You've seen it. Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind. She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods.
STORMTROOPER #5: Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops. Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face.
KYLO REN: Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need. A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS
FROM FRAME!: EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY The BLACK-MARKED X-WING SWOOPS DOWN again, FIRING, EXPLODING another TIE Fighter! On the ground:
STORMTROOPER: Pull back the tree line! Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS. FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS Han stops turns sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle. Han is ROCKED.
FINN: NO!! REY!!! Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF Finn irrationally
NO!! REY!!!: Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF Finn irrationally
FINN: He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone!
HAN: ( WALKS PAST )
HAN: You changed your hair.
LEIA: Same jacket.
HAN: No, new jacket. Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship. It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:
FINN: Poe. Poe Dameron. They move to each other and embrace.
POE: So are you!
FINN: What happened to you?
POE: What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night no you, no ship, nothing BB-8 BEEPS Poe listens, turns to Finn.
FINN: No, no, no. It wasn't just me.
POE: You completed my mission, Finn. That's my jacket?
FINN: Oh here.
POE: No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn.
FINN: Poe I need your help.
POE: General Organa. Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to
YOU: ( takes Finn's hand ) And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life
LEIA: ( takes Finn's hand ) And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life
FINN: ( surprised she knows ) Thank you, ma'am but a friend of mine was taken prisoner
LEIA: Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry. Finn is startled Poe jumps in:
POE: Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base.
LEIA: We're desperate for anything you can tell us.
FINN: That's where my friend was taken I've got to get there, fast.
LEIA: And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know.
DR. KALONIA: ( CHEWIE TALKS )
LEIA: I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home.
HAN: Don't do that.
LEIA: Don't do that.
HAN: Do what? She heads off.
LEIA: Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO.
HAN: I'm trying to be helpful!
LEIA: When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star.
HAN: ( SIGHS )
HAN: Listen to me, will you? I know every time you. every time you look at me, you're reminded of him.
LEIA: You think I want to forget him? I want him back! Han looks at her with sympathy.
HAN: There was nothing we could've done. ( hard for him to say ) There was too much Vader in him.
LEIA: That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.
HAN: We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever good at.
LEIA: We both did.
HAN: We lost our son, forever.
LEIA: ( LONG BEAT )
HAN: If Luke couldn't reach him, how could
I?: Luke is a Jedi. you're his father. There's still light in him. I know General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.
LEIA: Luke is a Jedi. you're his father. There's still light in him. I know General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.
GENERAL STATURA: General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.
REY: Where am I?
KYLO REN: ( LONG BEAT )
REY: Where are the others?
KYLO REN: You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? ( Rey stares at him ) You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea.
REY: That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. Kylo Ren stops, considers her. then reaches up, unlatches and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance.
KYLO REN: Tell me about the droid.
REY: ( a nervous beat ) He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator
KYLO REN: He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger Rey reacts afraid how does he know?
REY: Get out of my head But this just makes Kylo lean closer.
KYLO REN: I know you've seen the map. It's in there. and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:
REY: I'm not giving you anything.
KYLO REN: We'll see. He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze
REY: . You. you're afraid. that you will never be as strong as. Darth KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on Kylo Ren, who starts to leave. And we PRELAP:
KYLO REN: She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke:
SNOKE: And the droid?
SNOKE: Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker.
GENERAL HUX: We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system.
SNOKE: Good. Then we will crush them once and for all. Prepare the weapon. Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment that isn't what he meant at all
KYLO REN: Supreme Leader. I can get the map from the girl. I just need your If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me.
SNOKE: If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me.
REY: You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.
REY: You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER. Rey's heart pounds is she about to be killed, freed, or laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:
REY: You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door I will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. SHE IS IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly:
REY: And you will drop your weapon.
KYLO REN: Enraged, he RIPS OUT HIS SABER and
NO!: Enraged, he RIPS OUT HIS SABER and
GENERAL HUX: Begin charging the weapon!
STARKILLER TECHNICIAN: Yes, sir. Weapon charging.
POE: The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself.
SNAP: They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself.
BRANCE: A laser cannon?
SNAP: We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale.
MAJOR EMATT: ( HORRIBLE MEMORIES )
POE: I wish that were the case, Major. Poe hits a control. A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS.
HAN: So it's big.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR: How is it possible to power a weapon of this size?
FINN: It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD.
LEIA: ( eyes on datacard ) The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now. ( then, heart sinking ) Our system is the next target.
HAN: Okay, how do we blow it up? ( all eyes on him ) There's always a way to do that.
LEIA: Han's right. Han is surprised.
ADMIRAL STATURA: ( at first hesitant ) In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator.
FINN: There is one. All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location on the Starkiller Base it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK
ADMIRAL STATURA: ( HYPOTHESIZING )
MAJOR EMATT: . Maybe the planet. Poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator.
POE: We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR: They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate.
HAN: We disable the shields.
FINN: ( beat, then: ) I can do it.
HAN: I like this guy.
FINN: I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet
HAN: We'll get you there.
LEIA: Han, how?
HAN: If I told you, you wouldn't like it.
POE: So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go! And everyone splits.
HAN: Chewie, check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. Finn, be careful with those - they're Now you tell me?
FINN: Now you tell me?
LEIA: No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. Han looks over, there's Leia.
HAN: That's what I did it. So you'd miss She laughs, moves up close to him.
LEIA: I did miss you. He looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue:
HAN: It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was.good.
LEIA: . Pretty good.
HAN: Some things never change.
LEIA: ( SMILES )
STORMTROOPER: Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. We're searching the area.
KYLO REN: She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. Kylo exits.
FINN: How are we getting in?
HAN: Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. Finn is suddenly filled with dread.
FINN: We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! Chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: HELL YES WE ARE!
HAN: Alright, Chewie, get ready. Chewie GROANS: he's ready. Han studies the PANEL INDICATORS.
HAN: I AM PULLING UP!!! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY But the Falcon has no time it PLOWS through the trees! It then RISES
HAN: I get any higher, they'll see us! And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees!
OFFICER: Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert.
KYLO REN: Put every hangar on lock-down. She's going to try to steal a ship to Suddenly, Kylo senses something. Something familiar.
FINN: The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way.
HAN: What was your job when you were based Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?
FINN: Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?
HAN: Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?
FINN: I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.
HAN: People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us!
FINN: Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force!
HAN: That's not how the Force works!
FINN: Come on! They follow Finn on the snowy hike. On the horizon, THE

HAN: The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields?
FINN: I have an idea about that. Han and Chewie follow Finn.
FINN: Remember me?
CAPTAIN PHASMA: Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.
FINN: Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.
HAN: Bring it down. Bring it down.
FINN: Follow me. Finn SMILES as we CUT TO:
FINN: You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields.
CAPTAIN PHASMA: You're making a big mistake.
FINN: Do it. Chewie MOAN/TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons the controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE". Eyes on
HAN: Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her. The controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLED".
CAPTAIN PHASMA: ( to Finn, cruel ) You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all.
FINN: I disagree. What do we do with her?
HAN: Is there a garbage chute? Trash Yeah, there is.
FINN: Yeah, there is.
OFFICER: General, their shields are down!

SUCCESSION!: INT. X-WING - DAY
LT. BASTIAN: Direct hit!
ELLO ASTY: But no damage! Jess reacts.
POE: Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it! Another bombing run! Remember, when that sun is gone, that weapon will be ready to fire! But as long as there's light, we got a chance.
TIE FIGHTERS!: Guys, we got a lot of company!
POE: Guys, we got a lot of company!
FINN: We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover.
HAN: You sure you're up for this?
FINN: Hell no I'll go in find and try to find Rey ( improvising, fast ) The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads ( Han starts pointing with his chin to
SOMETHING BEHIND: FINN )
FINN ): Why are you doing that? Why are you doing this? I'm trying to come up with a plan. Finn turns AND SEES REY, CLIMBING OUT FROM INSIDE THE WALL, carefully climbing back up to the main level! He can't believe it! Chewie MURMURS his relief. Han is maybe more grateful than anyone.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR: The Oscillator's still standing.
OFFICER: X-wings coming back for another round of attacks!
HAN: Are you all right?
REY: What happened did he hurt you?
HAN: What happened did he hurt you?
FINN: What happened did he hurt you?
REY: Finn. What are you doing here?!
FINN: We came back for you. She is speechless this is all she's ever wanted anyone to do. Chewie TALKS and Rey's eyes nearly tear up.
REY: ( shrugs, smiles, though nearly in tears ) . That it was your idea. Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace.
FINN: How did you get away?
REY: I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it.
HAN: Escape now. Hug later.
SNAP: I got one behind me. See it?
JESS: Yeah, I'm on it!
JESS: Furillo's been hit!
SNAP: Watch out for ground fire!
HAN: They're in trouble. We can't leave. ( to Finn, re: Chewie ) My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em.
VOBER DAND: Two more X-wings down. That's half our fleet destroyed.
HAN: That girl knows her stuff.
HAN: We'll set the charges at every other He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders.
KYLO REN: Find them. They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN.
HAN: The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast catwalk. He turns.
KYLO REN: Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on the catwalk below.
HAN: Take off that mask. You don't need What do you think you'll see if I Han moves toward Kylo Ren.
KYLO REN: What do you think you'll see if I Han moves toward Kylo Ren.
HAN: The face of my son. Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED seeing the face of his son for the first time as a man.
KYLO REN: Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him.
HAN: That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive. SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch.
KYLO REN: No. The Supreme Leader is wise. UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene. ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern:
HAN: Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you you know it's true. Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it.
KYLO REN: It's too late.
HAN: No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you. For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears flood his stoic eyes.
KYLO REN: I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain.
KYLO REN: I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me? Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.
HAN: Yes. Anything. Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch
KYLO REN: Thank you. ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP SCREAM
FINN: ( PANTING ) ( ALSO PANTING )
REY: ( ALSO PANTING )
THE STRUCTURE!: INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Leia, feeling it instantly knowing drops into a seat,
ADMIRAL ACKBAR: The Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional. COMMODORE META reacts.
FINN: The Falcon's this way. Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy forest until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both out of breath. They look at each other. They both know: they can't run.
KYLO REN: We're not done yet.
REY: You're a monster!
KYLO REN: It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you. After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster AIMS IT! Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER she can't fire he strains too, especially with the WOUND Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY Rey's BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND another GESTURE and Rey FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away! She drops LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt.
FINN: Rey! Rey! Rey. Rey. Oh no. Oh no no no. Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE.
KYLO REN: In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER upon seeing the weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK.
TRAITOR!: In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER upon seeing the weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK.
FINN: Come get it. Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified Kylo Ren LUNGES but Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade! Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS amazingly Finn BLOCKS, COUNTER-ATTACKS clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys this challenge more! Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two men fighting, through the trees. Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks with a primal SAVAGERY Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN! LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES AGAIN their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK, the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers: And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity Finn is stunned unprepared for this fierceness. Rey sees this Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses That's when KYLO REN STRIKES: HE LANDS A BLOW TO FINN'S TORSO
NIV LEK: We just lost R-1!
JESS: We're overwhelmed! What do we do? It isn't working! Another pilot looks down SEES THE EXPLOSION coming from the OSCILLATOR. Relatively small, it's an opening:
YOLO ZIFF: Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. Looks like our friends got in!
POE: Red Four! Red Six! Cover us!
LT. BASTIAN: I'm on it!
ELLO ASTY: Everybody else, hit the target hard! Give it everything you got! And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR

JESS: Watch out!
ELLO ASTY: I'm hit! The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces.
POE: All teams - I'm going in! Pull up and cover me!
NIV LEK: Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck, The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts into the fiery breach.
STARKILLER TECHNICIAN: Weapon at full capacity in thirty Prepare to fire.
GENERAL HUX: Prepare to fire.
EXPLOSIONS!: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS LUKE'S BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD. She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a dozen blows until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest. Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A
KYLO REN: You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force!
REY: The Force. Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS BACK She ATTACKS HARDER! Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW and she SLASHES
COLONEL DATOO: Lieutenant, get back to your station!
YOUNG TECHNICIAN: ( stops, fleetingly ) Just look. We won't survive even Hux has gone! As he hurries off, WE HEAR:
GENERAL HUX: The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun. Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate. knowing.
SNOKE: Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren.
REY: Finn! Finn. Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries, holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores. They are left here to die nearby MORE TREES DROP as the planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all is lost. Her wet eyes look up to see:
POE: All teams! I got eyes on them!
SNAP: The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET IMPLODES THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we get further and further distance from what was Starkiller Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a corner of the galaxy. The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE, headed home.
POE: Our job's done here. Let's go home!
MEDIC: Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia. C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering. Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry. The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful. She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace. Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.
LEIA: Tell me. Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A
POE: Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on Poe runs over removes the ancient data device that Lor San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP which he SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY
LEIA: ( hand on her heart ) Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES. C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:
REY: We'll see each other again. I believe that. Thank you, my friend.
LEIA: Rey turns around.
