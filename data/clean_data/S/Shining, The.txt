JACK: Ah, I certainly can, and eh. I also understand why your people in Denver left it for you to tell me.
ULLMAN: Well, obviously some people can be
JACK: Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.

DOCTOR: Thank you. Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about. I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about. I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
WENDY: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
DOCTOR: Oh I know. Kids can scare you to death, but believe me these episodes are not at all uncommon, and they look much worse than they are.
WENDY: But eh what was the matter with him?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained. They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
DOCTOR: They're more akin to auto-hypnosis, a kind of self induced trance. If it re-occurs which I doubt
WENDY: Oh, I'm.I'm sure you're right.
DOCTOR: Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Only about three months. Eh we're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.

DOCTOR: Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
M.C.S. WENDY: No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
WENDY: No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
DOCTOR: Did he adjust well to school?
WENDY: No. He didn't like it too much at first, and then he had an injury, so we kept him out for a while, and, yeah, I.I guess that's about the time when I first noticed that he was talking to Tony.
DOCTOR: What sort of injury did he have?
M.C.S. WENDY: Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
WENDY: Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
WENDY: Well it's just one of those things. You know. purely an accident, um. My husband had oh. been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night. And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room. and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's.it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just. used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
M.S. DOCTOR: WENDY ( OFF ) ( CONT'D )
M.C.S. WENDY: WENDY ( CONT'D )

WENDY: Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
JACK: I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
DANNY: What was the Donner party?
JACK: There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times. They got snowbound one winter in the mountains. They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
DANNY: You mean they ate each other up?
JACK: They had to, in order to survive.
WENDY: Don't worry, Mom. I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
DANNY: Don't worry, Mom. I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
JACK: See, it's okay. He saw it all on the television.
ULLMAN: What time does the plane leave?
WATSON: Eight thirty.
ULLMAN: Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
GIRLS: Goodbye Mr. Ullman.
ULLMAN: ULLMAN & WATSON walk L-R to JACK sitting in chair.
ULLMAN: Good morning Jack. I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
JACK: No problem. In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
ULLMAN: Good. Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen. Is your family having a look around?
JACK: No, my son's discovered the games Oh. Has your luggage been brought
ULLMAN: Oh. Has your luggage been brought
JACK: Right there.
ULLMAN: Oh fine. Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
ULLMAN: Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
WATSON: WATSON walks out cam.L.
JACK: I'd better collect my family first.
ULLMAN: ULLMAN laughs and they move out cam.L.
ULLMAN: This is our Colorado Lounge.
WENDY: Oh, it's beautiful. My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
JACK: Sure is.
WENDY: God, I've never seen anything like this before. Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
ULLMAN: Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
WENDY: Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever
ULLMAN: Oh this old place has had an illustrious past. In its heyday it was one of the stopping places for the jet set,
WENDY: All the best people.
ULLMAN: All the best people.
ULLMAN: This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
WENDY: Two Girls carrying bags enter from cam.L.
GIRLS: Goodbye Mr. Ullman.
ULLMAN: Goodbye girls.
ULLMAN: And here are your quarters.
ULLMAN: Living Room, bedroom, bathroom, and a small bedroom for your son.
JACK: Perfect for a child.
WENDY: They move into apartment. JACK & WENDY move away through living room into bedroom - CAMERA TRACKS FORWARD after them.
ULLMAN: They move into apartment. JACK & WENDY move away through living room into bedroom - CAMERA TRACKS FORWARD after them.
JACK: JACK & WENDY move away and enter bathroom - CAMERA TRACKS after them.
JACK: Well, it's very. homely.
WENDY: DISSOLVE TO:
ULLMAN: This is our famous hedge maze. It's quite an attraction around here. The walls are thirteen feet high and the hedges are about as old as the hotel itself. It's a lot of fun,
WENDY: When was the Overlook built?
ULLMAN: Ah. construction started in 1907. It was finished in 1909. The site is supposed to be located on an Indian burial ground, and I believe they actually had to repel a few Indian attacks as they were building
ULLMAN: That's our Snowcat. Can you both drive a car?
ULLMAN: That's fine because basically the Snowcat operates very much like a car and it won't take you long to get the hang of it.
ULLMAN: As a matter of fact we eh. brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
WENDY: Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
ULLMAN: Oh.well this is our gold ballroom.
WENDY: Oh, I'll say.
ULLMAN: We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
WENDY: Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
ULLMAN: I'm afraid you're not going to do too well here unless you've brought your own supplies. We always remove all the booze from the premises when we shut down:
ULLMAN: that reduces the insurance that we normally have to carry.
JACK: We don't drink.
ULLMAN: Well then, you're in luck.
ULLMAN: Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
HALLORAN: This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
ULLMAN: This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
JACK: Mr. Halloran, I'm Jack, and this is my wife, Winifred.
HALLORAN: Glad to meet you, Jack.
HALLORAN: Glad to meet you, Winifred.

JACK: ( OFF ) Danny, did you get tired
DANNY: Danny, come on over here.
WENDY: Danny, come on over here.
WENDY: Thank you, Susie.
ULLMAN: Thank you, Susie.
ULLMAN: Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with It will be a pleasure. Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
HALLORAN: It will be a pleasure. Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
WENDY: Great. See you later, hon.
JACK: Bye darling.
HALLORAN: Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred. Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
WENDY: I'm a Wendy.
HALLORAN: Oh Wendy. That's nice. That's the God. This is the kitchen, huh?
WENDY: God. This is the kitchen, huh?
HALLORAN: Yeah, this is it. How do you like it, Danny? Is it big enough for you?
DANNY: Yeah, it's the biggest place I've ever seen.
WENDY: Yeah. This whole place is such an enormous maze, I feel I'll have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come in.
HALLORAN: Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen. a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
WENDY: I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
HALLORAN: Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu
HALLORAN: Now right here is our walk-in
HALLORAN: Now this is where we keep all of out meat. You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers. You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb. Do you like lamb, Doc?
DANNY: You don't? Well what's your favorite food then?
HALLORAN: You don't? Well what's your favorite food then?
DANNY: French Fries and Ketchup.
HALLORAN: Well I think we can manage that too, Doc. Come along now. Watch your step.
WENDY: Mr. Halloran,
HALLORAN: Beg pardon?
WENDY: Doc. You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
HALLORAN: I did?
WENDY: Yeah. We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. But how did you know that?
HALLORAN: Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
WENDY: Well, it's possible, but I honestly don't remember calling him that since we've been with you.
HALLORAN: Well anyway, he looks like a Doc, doesn't he?
HALLORAN: ( clicks his tongue ) Me ah - what's up, Doc?
HALLORAN: Now this is the storeroom.
HALLORAN: In here, Mrs. Torrance, is where we keep all the dried goods and the canned goods. We got canned fruits and vegetables; canned fish and meats; hot and cold cereals.
HALLORAN: Post Toasties, Cornflakes, Sugar Puffs, Rice Krispies, Oatmeal, Wheatina and Cream of Wheat.
HALLORAN: ( thought transfer ) How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?
HALLORAN: Now we got dried peaches, dried apricots, dried raisins and dried You know, Mrs. Torrance, you gotta keep regular, if you want to be
HALLORAN: You know, Mrs. Torrance, you gotta keep regular, if you want to be
ULLMAN: How're you getting on?
WENDY: How're you getting on?
ULLMAN: How're you getting on?
ULLMAN: Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes? We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
HALLORAN: No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just getting to the ice cream.
HALLORAN: Do you like ice cream, Doc?
DANNY: HALLORAN laughs.
HALLORAN: I thought you did.
HALLORAN: You folks don't mind if I give Danny some ice cream, while we're waiting for you?
JACK: Not at all.
WENDY: No, we don't mind.
HALLORAN: Sound good to you, Danny?
WENDY: Sound good to you, Danny?
DANNY: Okay. You behave yourself.
WENDY: Okay. You behave yourself.
HALLORAN: Now what kind of ice cream do you like Doc?
DANNY: Chocolate it shall be. Come on son.
HALLORAN: Chocolate it shall be. Come on son.
WENDY: It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
ULLMAN: Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
ULLMAN: By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
WENDY: Just like a ghost ship, huh?
ULLMAN: DISSOLVE TO:
HALLORAN: Do you know how I knew your name was Doc?
M.C.S. HALLORAN: You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
HALLORAN: You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
M.C.S. HALLORAN: I can remember when I was a little boy, my grandmother and I could hold conversations entirely without ever opening our mouths. She called it shining,

HALLORAN: How long have you been able to do it?

DANNY: Maybe he showed me something.
HALLORAN: Try to think what it was.
DANNY: Mr. Halloran, are you scared of this place?
HALLORAN: No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't. I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like Is there something bad here?
DANNY: Is there something bad here?
HALLORAN: Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind. say like is someone burns toast.
M.C.S. DANNY: HALLORAN ( OFF )
M.C.S. HALLORAN: Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see. Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago. I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.

JACK: And it was three goddam years ago. The little fucker had thrown all my papers all over the floor. All I tried to do was to pull him up. A momentary loss of muscular coordination. I mean. A few extra foot pounds of energy, per second. per second.
WENDY: Oh Jack! Thank God you're here.
WENDY: ( OFF ) ( IN SHOT ) Jack, there's someone else in the hotel with us. There's a crazy woman in one of the rooms. She tried to strangle Danny.
M.C.S. JACK: Are you out of your fucking mind?
JACK: Are you out of your fucking mind?
WENDY: No. It's the truth, really. I swear it. Danny told me. He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub. She tried to strangle him.

WENDY: Oh, I just don't understand.
WENDY: Well what about those bruises on his neck?
WENDY: Somebody did that to him.
JACK: I think he did it to himself.
WENDY: No! No, that's not possible.
JACK: Wendy, once you rule out his version of what happened, there is no other explanation - is there? It wouldn't be that different from the episode that he had before we came up here, would it?
JACK: Get him out of here?
WENDY: You mean just leave the hotel?
JACK: You mean just leave the hotel?
WENDY: CUT TO:
JACK: It is so fucking typical of you to create a problem like this when I finally have a chance to accomplish something. When I'm really into my work. I could really write my own ticket if I went back to Boulder now, couldn't I?
