ANGLE: The GUESTS arriving here for the Met gala enter almost in enchanted procession, each of them being personally greeted by the primary owner and manager of the club, WIN HOCKINGS, a charming, rakish ex-preppy. WIN stands in the middle of the floor in the throw of a spot, greeting. This is his element and his club, a son of old money, and a crossover creature to the fast life.

WIN: Glad I could be of help.

CLAIRE: You didn't like him?
WIN: Looks a little constipated to me.
CLAIRE: ( needling him ) It's called "solid". Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
JOEY VENZA: Immaculate as always, in a conservatively-cut European pinstripe, VENZA strides tautly into the shabby corridors.
WIN: The main floor stays public. The side rooms we try to keep available for special functions like tonight.
CLAIRE: It's terrific Win.
WIN: You still writing the occasional magazine article?
CLAIRE: Then c'mon. Follow me. The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.

VENZA: slashing WIN again, losing all control.
WIN: ( staggering back )
ANGLE: VENZA continues to attack him, stabbing WIN to the floor.
CLAIRE: screams, unable to imagine or believe it.
VENZA: looks up, hearing her. WIN sprawls, a lifeless, bloodied mass at VENZA'S feet. VENZA stares, returning CLAIRE'S stare, trying to concentrate, to focus and pull himself back together. He puts down the cutter, taking a step toward her.
CLAIRE: steps back, turning and moving back toward the elevator, quickens his step, after her.
VENZA: quickens his step, after her.
MIKE: T.J.? Is this a joke? Are you kidding me? Give me 20 minutes.
ELLIE: ( mumbling from under Switch the light off on your way

MIKE: ( grinning ) A Detective's supposed to identify
NEIL: ( upset ) Are you in charge here?
MIKE: No, sir.
NEIL: I asked for the man in charge.
MIKE: That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs.
NEIL: Don't tell me he's "busy". I asked for an ambulance for this woman Is she injured?
MIKE: Is she injured?
CLAIRE: ( softly )
NEIL: ( to Claire ) You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
MIKE: She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness. Could I ask you to step outside, please.
NEIL: No, I will not step outside.
MIKE: Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone. Help me out here, could you please leave.
NEIL: ( icily ) I don't really see what that has to do with.
CLAIRE: ( deadened; to Neil ) Neil, do what he says.
CLAIRE: ( quietly ) I'll be right outside. Can I get you a cup of coffee or

MIKE: ( puzzled ) I just sat and listened.
GARBER: Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
GARBER: Venza's either going to skip or try to get to her and Venza likes it here. I want her ass covered, 24 hour protection, but I don't want her to know there is any real I don't like what I'm hearing.
MIKE: ( to Garber ) I don't understand. If there's any danger, why not just level with
GARBER: ( with mock tolerance ) T.J. your friend's a little dense. When she realizes there's a killer tryin' to shut her up, she'll be on the next plane for Tahiti. somehow I think my way is better.
MIKE: GARBER turns back.
MIKE: Why not Patrol? They'd do just as good a job.
GARBER: When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
MIKE: ( disappointed ) Shit! A Nursemaid! My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug! ( turning to T.J. ) I got a 'choice' at all.
MIKE: You in this with me?
MIKE: ( yelling ) Tommy! Goddamnit! Get these skateboards off the goddamn kitchen

ELLIE: So how'd it go?
MIKE: Not great. I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a For how long?
ELLIE: For how long?
MIKE: 'Til they pick up the perp. Seniority gets day shift. You know what that means.
ELLIE: Well, I'll live with it, I've lived with it all my life. My Dad was a cop, he said, "whatever you do, honey, never go out with a cop". So, what did I do? I got a job with the cops. Then I married a cop. I probably gave birth to a cop. Tommy! Come over here and eat, it's
MIKE: Maybe you and Tommy should stay with my Mom.
MIKE: Don't start. The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi. . crummy. I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at I can still use a gun.

MIKE: ( reacting; to T.J. ) Not Koontz.
GARBER: ( to Neil ) We'd like to, just once, get a look at the entire layout, so we can evaluate security.
CLAIRE: This really isn't necessary. The security in this building is about the best in the city.
GARBER: ( ever the diplomat ) I'm sure you're right, Miss Gregory, but I'd consider it a favor if you'd let us look around.
CLAIRE: Be my guest.
GARBER: ( to his troops ) ( to Garber ) What about when she goes out?
MIKE: ( to Garber ) What about when she goes out?
GARBER: Discourage it. But stay with her if you can't. Call it in first so we can have a car on tail. She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine. okay, let's check it out.

MIKE: Sorry. Just checking.
CLAIRE: Straight ahead.
MIKE: Hard to find doors in this place.
CLAIRE: . Detective Keegan, I hope you understand how upsetting this is?
CLAIRE: . You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial.
NEIL: . He killed Win. he enjoyed Win made his choices, Claire. We all do
CLAIRE: . He killed Win. he enjoyed Win made his choices, Claire. We all do
NEIL: Win made his choices, Claire. We all do
CLAIRE: And I'm making mine.
NEIL: ( gently ) You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five. or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life.
CLAIRE: What am I supposed to do?! I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it! I can't just "let it go away"!!
NEIL: ( gently )
MIKE: ( chagrined ) I like 'em toasty.
MARY: Good night, Mr. Keegan.
NEIL: You're here 'til what time?
MIKE: I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.

CLAIRE: I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
MIKE: ( faltering ) I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea.
CLAIRE: Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
MIKE: Right. That's true.
CLAIRE: Can we go then?
MIKE: I'm supposed to call in.

GARBER: Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
MIKE: Even Joey Venza?!
GARBER: He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move. We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
MIKE: ( protesting ) What about when she identifies him?!
GARBER: If she identifies him. Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy! Venza was meat. He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up! You better hope she identifies him.

MIKE: I think she's crazy.
ELLIE: I'd identify him.

MIKE: You all right?
CLAIRE: I'm sorry about what happened.
MIKE: I'm sorry about what happened.
CLAIRE: Listen, that was my fault.
MIKE: ( disagreeing ) I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
CLAIRE: If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me. I think he heard me peeing! I hate that, I am glad he's in jail. Lieutenant Garber says when I identify him, they're going to lock him up and throw away the key.
