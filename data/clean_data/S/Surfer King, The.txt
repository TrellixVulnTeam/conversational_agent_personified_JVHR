THE SURFER KING: Bernard Murray Jr
JAFFA: Eddie!
EDDIE: (smiling, nodding) Jaffa. They do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked out some time in the past. JAFFA proceeds up to the Customer Relations Kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the kiosk. We see him open the box, it is full of CD's. He pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a CD player and amplifiers. He starts pushing buttons he's pushed a thousand times, and lights come on. He pulls down a microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works. He reaches into the box of CDs and pulls one out. We see it is Sheryl Crow. He gets the CD, examines it, and pops it into the CD player. He once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he pushes the "play" button on the CD player. His voice echoes through the park.         "Soak up the Sun" begins playing.
JAFFA: (smiling) Ladies and Gentlemen, Water World will be open in (checking his watch) twenty-six hours and forty-three minutes.
ROBBIE: (sardonically) Yeah. This is great. I love this plan. Drag me kicking and screaming from my happy home in California to some weird place in Colorado, and say hey, this'll be fun Robbie. Maybe we can go camping....
CONNIE: Look, I know you're not happy about this. But it wasn't my idea for your father to have some kind of mid-life crisis and disappear with his secretary to Mexico with our life savings.
ROBBIE: "Administrative Assistant." There's no such thing as a secretary anymore.
CONNIE: Fine. Administrative Assistant. We couldn't afford to sit around waiting any longer to see if he was coming back. I was able to land a good job here. And now thanks to Uncle Bernie you have this job at the Water Park...
ROBBIE: (shaking his head) Grounds crew. What kind of job is that? It sound like the guy who cleans out the coffee pots.
CONNIE: Bernie says you help keep the park clean, sweep up, that sort of thing. I'm sure it won't be so bad. Besides, a lot of the kids who work at this park go to the same high school you'll be going to. You can start the school year with some ready-made friends.
ROBBIE: I had friends in Oceanside. I had something to do for the summer. They pass the main Water World sign.    Hanging below it is a banner that says Opening Tomorrow!.
CONNIE: Hanging out at the beach surfing with your friends is not my idea of something
ROBBIE: All thanks to Dad and his secretary.
CONNIE: Administrative Assistant.
ROBBIE: Whatever.    Some summer.... They have arrived at the front gates of Water World, Kids are in a line leading to a check-in canopy kiosk that has a sign saying Employee Check In.
CONNIE: Promise me you'll give it a try....please?
ROBBIE: (giving in to the inevitable) I will. I promise. See you later He shuts the car door and walks over to the end of the line.
ALEX: (back still to ROBBIE) ...and so SHE says I'll have the filet AND the lobster". I had to borrow twenty bucks from Fitzgerald just to get out of the restaurant. Two guys in front of Alex are laughing now.     Further down the line however, another voice pops up.
DOUG: (waving to ALEX) By the way. Where is that twenty bucks?
ALEX: (avoiding) Ohhh, hey Dougie. I'll catch up with you later... (turning around to ROBBIE as not to continue the conversation) Hey, how you doin'? Haven't seen you before.
ROBBIE: (nodding) I'm Robbie. Robbie Zirpollo.
ALEX: I'm Alex.     Where you workin'?
ROBBIE: I believe it's with the Grounds Crew?
ALEX: What's the matter, can't swim?
ROBBIE: (surprised) I can swim. Why?
ALEX: Well, you look old enough to be a guard.
ROBBIE: Almost 16.     I get my license in September.
ALEX: It's just that most of the guys on grounds are a little younger than you. Most guys your age that can swim are guards.
ROBBIE: Well, I just moved here. I guess I missed guard tryouts. You're a guard then?
ALEX: Oh, no no no. I work concessions...at Aokee's Surf and Snack Shack. It's just as well. The guards are mostly stuck up anyway. The rest of us are the ones who know how to have fun.
ROBBIE: Can't swim, huh?
ALEX: (smiling) Nope.
ROBBIE: (listening to speaker on post above) What is that?
ALEX: (mimicking his perception of surfers) Surf tunes, dude!
ALEX (CONT'D): (gesturing) Ahh. And here we have the fair Melissa, time clerk extraordinaire...
MELISSA: (shaking her head no) Oh, Alex. Am I going to have to put up with your crap for another entire summer?
ALEX: (looking upward toward the sky) Dear Melissa. There's nothing about our relationship that couldn't be fixed by us spending a few moments together in the pumphouse behind Thunder Bay.
MELISSA: Yeah, well from what I hear, it would be a BRIEF few moments.
ROBBIE: (wincing) Ouch.
ALEX: (not missing a beat) My dear, you cut me to the quick. Check off my name and that of my amigo here, Mr. Robbie Zirpollo.
MELISSA: (handing them cards) Fill out these emergency cards, and turn them in when you pick up your uniforms.... (pointing) over there. And Alex?
ALEX: (to ROBBIE) She wants me. (turning back to MELISSA) Yeeees?
MELISSA: (finger pointing) This year, let's clock in only our OWN time card, shall we?
ROBBIE: (taken aback, breathing in through his nose) Whoa....who was that?
ALEX: (unimpressed, putting his hand on ROBBIE's shoulder as if to hold him back, like a horse that is riled up) Eeeaasy there, big fella. Not in your lifetime. (wistfully, glancing over) Or mine.
ROBBIE: So who is she?
ALEX: Miss Tiffany Maxwell, daughter of Big Mike Maxwell, owner and operator of this here fine water park. WE SEE TIFFANY and her two friends are quickly given their uniforms by the attendants, as they ignore the kids who have waited in line.
ALEX (CONT'D): See, Princess Tiffany and her friends pretty much have the run of the park. Her boyfriend is Dan Peterson, a guy we all call Cowboy, one of the lifeguards. Pretty decent guy from what I can tell. But she's a piece of work. Your best strategy is to steer clear of her and she won't cause you any trouble.
ROBBIE: Cowboy, huh. Big guy?
ALEX: Big. Guy.
ROBBIE: (takes in a deep breath)
MALE UNIFORM GUY: Hey Alex. (calling back to FEMALE UNIFORM
PERSON): Aokee's. Large. (to ROBBIE)
MALE UNIFORM GUY (CONT'D): Name? Female Uniform Person has brought a blue Hawaiian shirt on a hanger.
ROBBIE: Rob Zirpollo. Uh, Robert Zirpollo
MALE UNIFORM GUY: (looks on clipboard) Grounds? (looks at FEMALE UNIFORM
MALE UNIFORM GUY (CONT'D): (and FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON, together, ominously) Grounds. She disappears to the back.
ROBBIE: (to ALEX) So what is this grounds thing, anyway?
ALEX: Let's just say....you are critical and indispensable to the ongoing operation... and....flow of things here at the park. (he and MALE UNIFORM GUY exchange a knowing glance)
FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON: Here you go, tiger. One grounds. Medium. You have a pair of green shorts at home? ROBBIE shakes his head "no".
FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON (CONT'D): Buy some. Tonight. Wear them tomorrow along with this shirt. You need to report to the area just south of Surf's Up. Look for a guy wearing Army pants and glasses.
ALEX: I'll show him. I'm going in that
ALEX (CONT'D): (marching) Left. Left. Left right left.
AOKEE: (to person on the line) David...how you do this to me? I have full staff with you. I save your spot. I was counting on you. (listens, nods) Yes, yes....but The Gap? What you think you do there? Are there girls in swimming suits? Have you forgotten? (listens, shaking head) Tips. Do you get tips? Cash money? (listens some more) ALEX walks up.   AOKEE waves to him.   He is obviously upset.
AOKEE (CONT'D): (resigned) Well, come see us this summer, eh? You're a good kid...a good worker.     Yeah, you too. AOKEE hangs up the phone.
ALEX: Who....?
AOKEE: David. Seems to think there is future in retail. Now what I do? I'm one person short. Park opens tomorrow. AOKEE buries his head in his hands on the counter.
ALEX: (thinking) You know...I just met a guy that's old
AOKEE: (perking up) Good guy?
ALEX: Seemed like our kind of people. AOKEE thinks for a moment. He glances up towards Surf's Up. It hits both he and ALEX at the same time...
AOKEE: We need to get him before he get his plunger! They take off running.
AOKEE: (out of breath) Alex...... (wheeze) ..you got to go ahead... (wheeze) ...stall 'til I get there.
ALEX: (nodding, running in place)
OK.: ALEX takes off, and AOKEE runs again....
THE COLONEL: (looking up from clipboard) Well, it looks like we have a good staff here. Yes...yes a good staff. It will be an excellent summer. Remember as we go through training today, our park is judged by the work WE do. If we do it well, the people come back. (walking up and down the line) We have a little tradition here on the grounds crew. Rather than having to learn a lot of names, many of which I can never hope to pronounce properly, each grounds crew member gets a grounds crew nickname. You will be known by that nickname in every way except, of course, your paycheck and employee records. THE COLONEL looks over his paperwork.
THE COLONEL    (CONT'D): Let's see, what do we    have? Hmm...yes. OK, first up is Eddie    Cochran. Your grounds crew nickname    will be.....Eddie! EDDIE smiles knowingly. This has been his grounds crew nickname for the last 8 years, mostly because he would never answer to anything else, and THE COLONEL gave up trying.
THE COLONEL (CONT'D): Now crewmembers, listen up. Eddie here has eight years experience on the grounds crew. Why, I'd like to think there isn't anything, any situation that Eddie hasn't faced. Listen to him. Learn from him. Watch what he does. This man is the finest, most conscientious grounds crewman we've ever had. EDDIE is beaming with pride now. THE COLONEL pulls a brand new toilet plunger from the cart nearby and hands it to EDDIE. EDDIE shoulders it as if it were a rifle. THE COLONEL walks down the line.
THE COLONEL (CONT'D): Let's see...Clark? Hmmm. Your grounds crew nickname will be....Sparky. It is all ROBBIE can do not to laugh. THE COLONEL goes on to the next kid, SKEETER who is tall, skinny and goofy-looking. SKEETER'S eyes are faced forward, but something catches them. His eyes follow an unseen object as we begin to hear a small mosquito. Finally his eyes follow it until he looks, cross eyed at his own nose. THE COLONEL has taken note of this and is following it too. SKEETER can take no more, and brushes it off his nose as he makes a face.
SKEETER: Sorry, sir. Mosquito.
THE COLONEL: Hmmm.....your grounds crew nickname will be.....Skeeter. THE COLONEL steps over the cart and gets another new plunger and hands it to SKEETER who follows EDDIE's lead. Next in line is a short, chubby lad, SNITCH. As THE COLONEL approaches him, a quick sound of passing gas is heard. THE COLONEL is startled, and SNITCH makes a quick finger motion indicating the culprit is SKEETER, next to him.
THE COLONEL (CONT'D): (looking at the clipboard) Bradley, is it? OK, Mr. Bradley.....your grounds crew nickname will be Snitch. SNITCH shows his dismay with a frown. THE COLONEL has run out of new plungers already and is forced to move to one of last year's leftovers, which look somewhat depressing. He gets one and give it to SNITCH, who looks at it, makes a face, and decides not to shoulder it. ROBBIE is so depressed he looks like he's about to pass out. His worst fears have been realized.    His summer is passing before his eyes. There's only one more person, a young 14 year-old girl, to go before ROBBIE. THE COLONEL addresses her.
THE COLONEL (CONT'D): Melinda Tally. Hmmm... your grounds crew nickname will be... (thinking) Suddenly ALEX bursts onto the scene, and even he, at this point, is somewhat out of breath.
ALEX: Hello, Colonel!
THE COLONEL: (thinking, staring) Alex, isn't it?
ALEX: Yes sir, Colonel. And what a fine staff you've assembled this year. Have you told them yet about your army background?
THE COLONEL: Well, no, I didn't think it was..
THE COLONEL: Well, it really wasn't much of a...
ALEX: (interrupting again) Wasn't much? (again, to grounds kids) Can you just imagine for a moment the germs and bacteria our American soldiers could pick up in an unsanitised army latrine? It's impossible to determine just how many lives have been saved thanks to the efforts of this one humble Army Colonel.
THE COLONEL: Well, I suppose when you put it that way...
ALEX: (to the grounds kids) I, too, came up through the ranks when at age 14, I began my service here at Water World learning from this great man.
THE COLONEL: Yes....I remember now.....what was your grounds nickname...?
ALEX: Not even sure I remember it myself, sir. But I remember much more. Did you tell them about the film?
THE COLONEL: Film?
ALEX: (to THE COLONEL) "Hygiene Makes You Happy" (to the grounds kids) Every enlisted man in the army has seen it. Some by choice. All from the mind of The Colonel here...
THE COLONEL: (to himself) I never forget a grounds nickname.... AOKEE has finally made it now, but is, of course, out of breath again.
AOKEE: Colonel....terrible mistake... ALEX gets behind AOKEE, deciding he needs some help, feeding him words.
ALEX: (quietly behind AOKEE) Bureaucratic bumble...
AOKEE: Bureaucratic bumble....
ALEX: Lost paperwork....
AOKEE: Lost paperwork....
ALEX: An error in the front office...
AOKEE: Error in front office....
ALEX: Spiced applesauce....
AOKEE: Spiced... AOKEE stops, turn and glares at ALEX, who merely smiles and shrugs.
THE COLONEL: Good God, man, what are you trying to say? ALEX comes around from behind AOKEE.
ALEX: It's Robbie sir. He was supposed to work at Aokee's and through some crazy mix-up, he ended up here.
THE COLONEL: (looking at clipboard) Zirpollo? Well this is highly irregular... He is flipping though the papers, confused.
ALEX: (can't pass this up)
THE COLONEL: Most annoying....
ALEX: Never happened before....
THE COLONEL: Never happened before....
ALEX: Spaghetti marinara...
THE COLONEL: Spa....what? (exasperated) Well, if he was supposed to be assigned to you, we'll just have to let him go... ROBBIE has caught on and is quick to step out of line, and pick up his shirt to be ready to go.
ROBBIE: (to THE COLONEL) I was confused myself, sir. I had heard I was working for some Hawaiian guy.
AOKEE: (reassuring) I promise, we go straight to personnel, straighten the whole thing out. You won't need to worry.
THE COLONEL: Very well.     We'll just have to make-do. THE COLONEL goes back to the girl MELINDA he was about to nickname before the interruption, but is staring after ALEX, AOKEE and ROBBIE as they walk off. He looks at MELINDA. He looks back at ALEX & company. It hits him.
THE COLONEL (CONT'D): (remembering) Snafu.
MELINDA: Sir?
THE COLONEL: His grounds crew nickname.     I remember it now. Snafu.
BIG MIKE: (motioning to get everyone to settle down) Okay, everybody, let's quiet down for a minute. (they do, and he looks down at his clipboard) For those who don't know me, my name is Michael Maxwell, and I...sort of run things around here. A chant starts up, with affection...
EVERYONE TOGETHER: Big Mike! Big Mike! Big Mike! BIG MIKE smiles, this has happened before, probably a tradition.
BIG MIKE: (again motioning to settle down) Okay, yeah thanks. Now, I want go over a few basic things. First of all, make sure you've all filled out your paperwork with personnel, cause nobody gets paid unless they do. Come to think of it, I suppose it's better for me that you don't fill out your paperwork, then I don't have to pay you. I'll make it optional. If you want to get paid, fill out your paperwork. (looking at clipboard) Let's remember, the people who come here are our guests, and your job is to see they have a safe and fun experience here. Let's work together to keep the park clean and safe, and we'll have a great summer together. Now with a few words is our head lifeguard, Richard Thompson. Another cheer starts up, smaller this time, which ALEX starts.
SMALLER GROUP: Big Dick! Big Dick Big Dick!
RICHARD: (wincing some, but not
RICHARD (CONT'D): (glancing at the water wing group wistfully, almost to himself) ...a long ways to go... He looks down at his clipboard.
RICHARD (CONT'D): ...but I'd like to take a moment to speak, mostly to the guards, but certainly everyone has a role in this. We can take everything we've learned and distill it down to two simple rules. Rule number one: He pauses, thoughtful for a moment, but building into a near rage for effect to impress on everyone...
RICHARD (CONT'D): (loudly, emphatically, angry at the thought that anybody might...) Don't drown! He stops, composing himself.
RICHARD (CONT'D): (almost quietly) Rule number two: Again, thoughtful but building to a rage at the thought that this could happen...
RICHARD (CONT'D): (loudly, emphatically) Don't let anyone else drown! He stops again, and regains his composure.
RICHARD (CONT'D): (almost quietly to the stunned crowd) Thank you. Have a great summer! There is stunned silence for a moment.    They're not sure how to react.
ALEX: (to ROBBIE) Hey, hey lookin' good. Blue is your color. Beats that stupid t-shirt, huh?
AOKEE: (unhappy, stressed) Alex! You are late. Come on, is opening day! ROBBIE finishes the pineapple and hands the tray to AOKEE, almost spilling it.
AOKEE (CONT'D): (to ROBBIE and ALEX) You two start setting tables. ALEX takes a pile of silverware wrapped in napkins, and points to ROBBIE to grab a box of sugar packets to refill the dispensers. ROBBIE grabs it quickly, enthusiastically, but loses his grip and spills the packets on the floor. At that moment, AUDREY a girl in her teens who works at AOKEE'S and is stacking plastic cups on the counter, accidentally knocks a stack of cups to the ground. RAMON, a teenage boy who works there is behind the counter. He bends over, disappearing, and we hear a crash of pots and pans. His head peers up from below the counter sheepishly. AOKEE turns from the grill looking at all this, and has a worried look, but smiles and shrugs weakly.
AOKEE (CONT'D): (to ALEX, gesturing) Alex. Come here a minute. ALEX comes up close next to him at the grill so they can talk.
AOKEE (CONT'D): (with intensity) Alex, look. We falling apart. I made you assistant manager this year. Go assistant manage.
ALEX (CONT'D): Sorry, Sarah, but I need to borrow this.
SARAH: (surprised) Hey! How did you know I wear shorts under that?
ALEX: (mock surprise, rolling his eyes) Oh, Puh-leeaase. ALEX walks back out to the dining area, everyone is still working.
ALEX (CONT'D): (to all) Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Everyone stops and looks at ALEX.
ALEX (CONT'D): In exactly 30 minutes, hundreds of dripping wet customers with fistfuls of money smelling of chlorine and suntan lotion will be walking in here. And what will they be looking for? (as if directing a choir)
EVERYONE TOGETHER: (except ROBBIE, who doesn't know any better) The best teriyaki east of the pacific!!!
ALEX: Annnnnnd?
EVERYONE TOGETHER: (Again except ROBBIE, who doesn't know any better) The finest smoothies in the state!!!
ALEX: Now, everyone's a little tense, except me, of course. So to help you get in the proper frame of mind and relax, we need
ALEX (CONT'D): This is little tune I like to call the Paradise Slide. (mouthing with the song as it starts) One, two, a one two three. The music starts and ALEX, now wearing SARAH's grass skirt, launches into his version of the electric slide, Hawaiian style. EVERYONE ELSE gets the beat and begins working to the music. AOKEE is using his spatulas as drum sticks on the overhanging kitchen tools. RAMON has inverted an empty pot and is beating it conga-drum style. ROBBIE has picked up the sugar packets and ALEX is dancing and quickly (almost casually) tossing silverware/napkin rolls to ROBBIE as ROBBIE catches them (at first with some difficulty) and puts them on the tables. SARAH has re-stacked the cups, and is juggling salt & pepper shakers, placing them on the tables. AUDREY chops onions to the beat.
EVERYONE TOGETHER: (on the chorus) Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. AOKEE has now taken all the chicken off the grill and comes out from behind the counter, dancing. The others form a CONGA LINE behind him.
EVERYONE TOGETHER (CONT'D): (on the chorus) Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. As they go by the tables they put on any missing items. They get into it more and more, AOKEE especially, swinging his huge, 375 pound guy hips.
EVERYONE TOGETHER (CONT'D): (on the chorus) Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. As the song ends (abruptly), AOKEE bumps a surfboard (part of the restaurant's decoration) with his hip, knocking it and another one to the ground.
AOKEE: (to ALEX and ROBBIE) You did good work today. Here. I made you some of my special Power Smoothies. More customers later wanting dinner before park closes. I can't have you falling asleep on me.
AOKEE (CONT'D): (to ALEX) Alex, we are completely out of table stretchers and left-handed coffee pots. Take Robbie and go find some. I think some at the first-aid station near Surf's Up pool.
ALEX: (nodding knowingly) Right. See you in a little while. They walk off carrying their smoothies.
ROBBIE: So that was a typical lunch crowd?
ALEX: Well, it's early in the season yet. We'll get busier.
ROBBIE: (incredulous) Busier?
ALEX: (laughing) Don't worry. You'll get used to it.      And tips were good, right?
ROBBIE: There's nothing like cash money in your pocket. What's that over there? They are coming up on THE WAVE area.
ALEX: Oh, you'll find this ride interesting.
ALEX: (as a rider falls) It's a lot harder than it looks.
ROBBIE: I can't imagine it's that difficult. (to himself) ...no rudder on the board...
ALEX: Now this is a place of many wonders.     See those guys in line over there? WE SEE some guys that look a little stoned with unusual hair laughing and talking to each other.
ALEX (CONT'D): We call them "Wave Bums". They all have season passes, and do little more than ride the wave all day long. Some of them get pretty good. Alex points up to a fence, behind which some smoke appears to be drifting up.
ALEX (CONT'D): That's where they hang out when they're not riding the wave. Don't get too close to them.
ROBBIE: No?
ALEX: (sniffing) Contact high. ROBBIE nods, understanding. ALEX points back to THE WAVE.
ALEX (CONT'D): And there, my friend, is another one of The Wave's features. WE SEE a pretty girl in line to ride.
ALEX (CONT'D): We call them "Wave Babes". And there's a special secret to this ride. With that ALEX walks over to BOB, a guy in his late teens, wearing a Security Golf Shirt. He is standing and looking off in a different direction.
ALEX (CONT'D): Hey, Bob....can I borrow your radio a minute?
BOB: Sure. He hands him the radio, and ALEX is back with ROBBIE.
ALEX: (into radio) Hey Frank, it's Alex. ALEX waves and FRANK, the guard watching THE WAVE waves back.
FRANK VO: (heard through the radio) Yo, Alex.
ALEX: (into radio) Listen you have a possible code 4. (to ROBBIE) Means a "hottie".
ALEX (CONT'D): (to radio) She's up next. A free chicken sandwich and a smoothie if you bounce up the pressure a bit.
FRANK VO: (heard through radio) You got it bud. But two smoothies. "Volcanos".
ALEX: (to ROBBIE) He knows my weak spot. (to radio) Two Volcanos and a chicken sandwich.
FRANK VO: (heard through radio) Time to go to ludicrous speed!
ALEX: (to ROBBIE, still holding the radio) Watch, and wait.... THEY LOOK intently at the WAVE BABE, who is pretty good, even with the increased water flow. But, after a few deft moves, she falls. ALEX looks, and sees what he is looking for. ROBBIE smiles.
ALEX (CONT'D): Yesss! We look back at the WAVE BABE, but the water is obscuring our view. We then see a medium shot of SKEETER and SNITCH. The WAVE BABE walks past them carrying a board, but we don't see below her waist, the board obscures our view. SNITCH sees, and freezes, dumbstruck. SKEETER is looking down at the grate where THE WAVE water drains. He reaches down and pulls something out, and turns to the WAVE BABE walking away.
SKEETER: (unaffected) Excuse me... Miss? (louder) Hello...excuse me...? Finally she turns. We see her, but just a flash of her from the back, as the board covers her waist area. She is puzzled by this grounds kid.
SKEETER (CONT'D): (holding up the bottom to her swimsuit) Is this yours? She looks down behind the board and reacts.     She bites her lower lip, winces and nods yes. SKEETER hands her her swimsuit, and she looks around and backs away towards a towel hanging from the fence nearby. SNITCH is still frozen, stunned by what he's just seen, mouth wide open. SKEETER waves his hand in front of SNITCH's face. No reaction.   He's never seen a naked girl before. We're back to ALEX and ROBBIE.
ROBBIE: (looking at ALEX) You were right. I was interested in
ALEX: Well, sometime bring your swimsuit. We'll come back on break. I'll show you how to do it. Surf's is this way. And keep an eye out for Frank over there. We owe him. ROBBIE nods in agreement, and they walk off.
ALEX: (pointing) The First Aid station is over there. Just ask the guard. I just want to say hello to this girl I know.
ROBBIE: ROBBIE walks over to the First Aid Station. DOUG FITZGERALD, the guy we heard in line on the first day is there, he's a guard.
ROBBIE (CONT'D): Hey. I've been sent to find some table stretchers and left-handed coffee pots.
DOUG: Oh, you must be the new guy at Aokee's.
ROBBIE: Yeah, how'd you know?
DOUG: Lucky guess. Saw some at the top of River Country. Just ask one of the guards over there.
ROBBIE: Thanks.
DOUG: And hey...tell that wienie Alex he still owes me twenty bucks!
ROBBIE: (looking back and waving as he walks away) Got it.
JAFFA: (calling out) Alex! They turn and walk over.
ALEX: Jama...I mean...Jaffa the Jamaican...what shakes, it mon?
JAFFA: Jus' the same old this's and that's, mon.
ALEX: Jaffa, meet Robbie Zirpollo. (to ROBBIE) Jaffa plays the tunes and talks the talk. The PHONE RINGS, and Jaffa turns to answer.
JAFFA: (into phone) What? No way. (hangs up phone, to ALEX &
ROBBIE): Check it out... JAFFA smiles and picks up a radio.
JAFFA (CONT'D): (into radio) Attention Lost River guards. We have a report that some huge fat bald guy has abandoned his swimsuit and is slidin' down Lost River with nothin' on but a smile. Be watchin' for a great white whale now.
JAFFA: (on PA system now, into mike) Attention please. Will Mr. John Big Bootay report to Lost River Splashdown. John Big-Bootay to Lost River Splashdown.
ALEX: (to ROBBIE) He's calling for security. ALEX wanders off a moment, looking at something going on in the distance.
ROBBIE: (to JAFFA) Wow. Jamaica. I thought I was far from home.
JAFFA: (dropping the accent a bit) I'll let you in on a little secret. Perception is everything...now, Jamal from Aurora, he's probably over with those guys... WE SEE SKEETER and SNITCH walking into the men's room, looking suspiciously around.
JAFFA (CONT'D): (back to the accent) ...cleaning the rest rooms. But Jaffa from Jamaica, he's in customer service, wearin' the nice shirt and playing the music. Perception and atmosphere. You get it? ROBBIE smiles and nods, and waves goodbye to catch up with
ALEX: Hey Eddie.     What have you got?
EDDIE: Water balloon. EDDIE reached onto his cart and pulls out a pair of scissors, eyeing them.
ALEX: You got this?
EDDIE: Yeah.   Rookies! ALEX and ROBBIE walk away as EDDIE places a "RESTROOM CLOSED" sandwich board in front of the door. Just then BIG MIKE rushes up.
BIG MIKE: (big hurry-potty emergency) Oh Eddie. Listen, I know you're working but you hold on for just a minute. I've been so busy, and I really gotta go. EDDIE motions and tries to find the words....
EDDIE: But....no.... But BIG MIKE is already in. Eddies waits for it, wincing, and there is a loud splash...
BIG MIKE (O.S.): (echoing through the door) Yeahhhah that's cold! EDDIE just shrugs and puts away his scissors.
AMY: ...so then he just disappeared.      I had to call my Dad to come pick me up.
ROBBIE: (to KATIE) Hi. We're looking for some table stretchers and left-handed coffee pots.
KATIE: What? Amy, this guy is looking for a table stretcher?
AMY: (coming over) Aokee's huh?
ROBBIE: (surprised) Uh, yes...
AMY: (to ROBBIE, seeing ALEX in the background) They're all down at Big Mike's last I saw. (to ALEX) When you gonna tell him?
ALEX: Hi, Amy.   Who's this?
AMY: Katie, this is Alex and...
ROBBIE: (taken with KATIE) Robbie. Ummm, Rob Zirpollo.
AMY: Well, anyway, Big Mike's is where they are.
ROBBIE: Thanks. ALEX and ROBBIE walk off.
AMY: What a couple of losers.
KATIE: I don't know...I thought Robbie was kind of cute...
AMY: Listen, you're new, so let me tell you how things are. First those guys were wearing blue shorts. That means
KATIE: Trash rats?
AMY: Bottom feeders. Grounds kids. Babies. They clean the toilets and empty the trash. Most are only 14 years old. It's the only job younger kids can do here. Next up is concessions. They're our "middle class". We don't hang with them and they don't much hang with us. At the top of heap are the guards. You are a guard. Girl, if you want to go out with someone, stick with your own kind.
KATIE: (looking off at ROBBIE and ALEX walking away) Aw, that's just silly. I think he's cute.
ROBBIE: What did that girl Amy mean?
ALEX: About what?
ROBBIE: When she said, when are you going to tell him?
ALEX: I'll tell you over a hamburger at Big Mike's. ROBBIE and ALEX proceed to BIG MIKE's out of frame. SUDDENLY in the background we see a tube splashdown from a slide and the 7 year-old girl riding in it falls out. Realizing she is no longer safely in a tube she screams and begins splashing as if drowning. A guard nearby blows a single tweet of her whistle. IN SLOW MOTION we see four other guards throughout the area turn and react to the whistle. They begin running, BAYWATCH style towards the scene.
RESCUE GUARD: (slow-motion, voice distorted, to the girl) Staaaannnd Uuuuuuuupppp! The drowning girl stops splashing wildly, and realizes she can indeed stand up. She looks at all the guards lined up, smiles sheepishly, and walks out of the pool.
ROBBIE: (Shaking his head) Aokee's not going to be happy. Nobody seems to know where these things are...
ALEX: (smiling) Yep. (now laughing)
ROBBIE: What?
ALEX: There's no such thing as a table stretcher or a left-handed coffee pot.
ROBBIE: What a dirty trick.
ALEX: (smiling) It's just Aokee's way of giving you a tour of the park without having to be there. Consider it a rookie initiation.
ROBBIE: (still mad) Humph.
ALEX: Time to make it up to you.    Come on.
DAVE: Alex!
ALEX: Hey Davey...how 'bout two for two?
DAVE: Malts?
ALEX: (looks at ROBBIE) Chocolate. (ROBBIE nods) DAVE disappears for moment.
ALEX (CONT'D): Now, if he ever shows up at our back door, we owe him chicken and smoothies.
ROBBIE: But...don't we get an employee discount? Shouldn't we go in the front?
ALEX: Well...the discount is larger this way. ROBBIE is getting out money from his pocket, counting through it. DAVE shows up with two burgers and two malts, and hands them to ALEX, disappears and shuts the door quickly. ROBBIE is still staring at his money.
ALEX (CONT'D): Come on...let's go eat! They walk out of frame.
ALEX: Oh boy.   Here we go.
ROBBIE: What now?
ALEX: Aokee. The pigeons have been taking target practice on his trophy pedestal. Come on. They exit out the same doorway as AOKEE.
AOKEE: (speaking Hawaiian) Stupid Pigeons. They should all die!
ALEX: (to ROBBIE) Happens every week.
ROBBIE: (to AOKEE) What is this thing for anyway?
AOKEE: Someday, Robbie.   Someday. He keeps cleaning.
ALEX: (to ROBBIE) That stand is to display the coveted Surfer King trophy. Aokee seems to think that one day some concessions kid with more courage than brains is going to beat the lifeguards in the annual Employee Olympics.
ROBBIE: And what would this concessions kid have to do?
ALEX: Nothing, really. Just out surf the strongest guard of them all in the surfing competition. No big deal.
ROBBIE: Has it ever happened?
ALEX: A guard always wins the surf competition. Know why?
TOGETHER: (ROBBIE and ALEX) Because concessions kids can't swim!
AOKEE: (still cleaning) Someday. They go back into AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK.
KATIE: (to ROBBIE) Hi there.
ROBBIE: (blinking, smiling) Hello. On break?
KATIE: Yeah.   Two Blue Crushes please.
ROBBIE: Coming up. He shakes a mix container, blends it for about 5 seconds and pours it out into two cups. He then puts in two umbrellas with pineapple.
AMY: Oooh. Umbrellas.       I've never gotten umbrellas before.
ROBBIE: These are only for VIP guests. AMY looks over to KATIE and rolls her eyes. ALEX arrives at this point, and decides to provide a distraction.
ALEX: Amy. Have you ever seen the fabulous Cummings and Robbins 2000-B?
AMY: (shaking her head) I don't think so. As he leads her back into the kitchen...
ALEX: It's incredible.      It washes 2000 plates an hour....
KATIE: (to ROBBIE) So... you're not from around here, huh?
ROBBIE: California. I just moved here at the beginning of the summer.
KATIE: I'll bet California's nice.      I've never been west of the mountains.
ROBBIE: You'd love the ocean. And the sunsets are incredible. You can almost hear the sizzle as the sun drops into the ocean... (daydreaming a bit) Of course, we all know it doesn't drop into the ocean.
KATIE: No. (pause) I'm surprised you're not a guard, coming from the ocean and all.
ROBBIE: Let's just say I missed my chance, and Alex saved me from a death worse than fate. I was very nearly a trash rat.
KATIE: (frowns) Oh. Good save. ALEX has distracted AMY all he could and they return from the kitchen.
AMY: Well. That was exciting. Maybe next time you can show me how to scrub the grill. Come on, Katie. They leave.
ALEX: (to ROBBIE, interested) Well...how'd you do?
ROBBIE: (thinking) Mmmm. I told her how beautiful the California sunsets are.
ALEX: Good job. You work fast. Hey it's time for our break. Bring your swimsuit?
ROBBIE: Yeah.   The Wave?
ALEX: The Wave.    I love that water. ROBBIE looks confused.
ALEX (CONT'D): Can't swim. It's only three inches deep.
ROBBIE: (grabbing his suit and a towel) Ah ha! Let's go.
ALEX: Now, just take it easy, and don't expect too much at first. When you wipe out, your ride is done. ALEX is up now, and he grabs the board and jumps in. He is pretty good, but not nearly as good as the WAVE BUMS. He does a few tricks and wipes out. He gets up and walks up to the line to watch ROBBIE.
ALEX (CONT'D): (shouting) Just ease into it. ROBBIE takes the board and looks around. He jumps full force onto the wave. It takes him just a moment to get the feel of the board, and then he is all over it, making the WAVE BUMS look like rookies. Spins, rolls, everything that can be done he does. Finally, the guard blows a whistle indicating that his time is up.
ALEX (CONT'D): (meeting him at the exit) Gees. Where did you learn to do that?
ROBBIE: I'm from Oceanside, California.    I was born on a surfboard. They start walking back. They stop for a moment to look at Thunder Bay. Just then a wave spews out, and kids on tubes are screaming as they always do.
ALEX: Think you could ride that?
ROBBIE: (looking right into ALEX's eyes) In my sleep. ALEX just smiles.
AOKEE: What you so happy about?
AOKEE: Listen. Some guy came in today and try to buy a sandwich and pay with a phone card. Today I believe anything.
ALEX: I took Robbie to The Wave today.
AOKEE: (looking around) What? He drown?
ALEX: No. It turns out that he's from Oceanside. California. You know, where they always hold those surf competitions?
ALEX: It turns out that he placed second in the state high school finals for the shortboard competition. As a Sophomore.
AOKEE: Robbie. (laughing in disbelief, dismissive, then serious) Robbie barely walk without help.
ALEX: I saw it myself.      You wouldn't believe it. We hear a loud CRASH from the kitchen.      AOKEE winces and gestures toward the kitchen.
AOKEE: I don' believe it.      Our Robbie?
ALEX: Our Robbie.
AOKEE: (thinking) If this true....this could be da year.
ALEX: That's what I was thinking.
AOKEE: Well, go get him. We need to make ready. He not just walk in and win this thing.
ALEX: You heard it. He's in the kitchen...
AOKEE: Robbie, sit down. Alex, make up a Volcano. This boy in training.
ROBBIE: (sitting down, worried) What did I spill now? WE HEAR the whine of a blender as ALEX is working on the Volcano Smoothie.
AOKEE: Robbie, Alex tell me you are some kind of surfer. This true?
ROBBIE: I dunno. Yeah, surfing is usually how I spend my summers.
AOKEE: You know about Employee Olympics?
ROBBIE: Yeah.   Some kind of trophy.
AOKEE: Surfer King trophy. Very big.     Very nice. (looking down) Concessions never win. ALEX arrives with the Volcano Smoothie. He turns a chair around and sits. They will gang up on him.
ROBBIE: I dunno...seems kind of silly to me.
ALEX: It's a big deal. Every girl     wants to date you. Every guy wants to BE      you. Special privileges...we all     wear standard uniforms.   The Surfer King     gets to be creative. You ever see the      cowboy hat Cowboy wears?
ROBBIE: It shouldn't be that hard...how good could this Cowboy be?
AOKEE: He very good. His family go to Hawaii every year, two, three weeks. Good surfer. If you do this, you need to see Pipeman.
ALEX: He's a myth.
AOKEE: Oh, no. Pipeman very real. Works here in park. Low profile. You must find him and convince him to teach you the secrets of the Thunder Bay wave. This not the ocean, surf boy.
ALEX: (thinking) Pipeman. The Banzai Pipeline. I get it. Some kind of legendary surf champ. Where do we find him?
AOKEE: I only see him once, maybe twice. Stay behind scenes. But here he is and find him you must. (to ROBBIE) So. You do this? Robbie looks at them, thinking for a moment.
ROBBIE: (into phone) Hello, Grandma? No, I'm fine. Listen, Grandma...I need you to send me a few of my things... AOKEE and ALEX are huddled around smiling.
BIG MIKE: (angry) ....why you wouldn't believe the things I've heard. Just stupid things. Cutting in line. Demanding special treatment. Oh, and how about this one: (mimicking her) Princesses don't carry trash. (back to his voice) I've often thought it was a mistake to have you work here. Maybe I was right.
TIFFANY: (trying to dance out of it) Oh, daddy. You know how jealous people get.
BIG MIKE: I'd almost believe that. But I was behind the First Aid station when you said the "princess" line. This park exists because the kids here work hard. They need to be treated fairly. They need to see you are just another lifeguard.
TIFFANY: (protesting) But I'm not just another lifeguard.
BIG MIKE: (mad again) You won't even be that if this continues. If you want to keep coming here every day and driving that little convertible of yours, I need to see real, concrete changes in your attitude.
TIFFANY: All right.     What do you expect me to do?
BIG MIKE: For one thing, start mingling with "the commoners". You'd be amazed at how nice some of the people who work here are. Make some friends outside that little group of yours. It's the work of the average teenager here that puts food on our table. Show some gratitude.
TIFFANY: (thinking a moment) Fine. I'll work it.
BIG MIKE: (softening, but firm) Good. Work on it. Please?
TIFFANY: (nodding, but we don't believe her) Oh, Daddy. Don't worry about a thing.
ALEX: (looking up at the sign) This will be good. Aokee throws a great Luau.
ROBBIE: I don't how much fun it will be.     With Aokee hosting, we'll be working.
ALEX: There'll still be time for fun. Most of the work is setting up. Besides, we get paid, too. When was the last time you got paid to party? With that, ALEX punches in, as if to punctuate the line.
AOKEE: (pouring out four smoothies to ROBBIE and ALEX) OK. You work hard, and we fine now. Your time to party. Here they are. Special Love Smoothies. Be careful!
ALEX: (to ROBBIE) These never fail. ALEX picks up two Leis from a box behind the counter. He and Robbie walk over to AMY and KATIE who are standing over near the buffet.
ALEX (CONT'D): (to ROBBIE, but if front of AMY and Katie) Now this will never do.
ROBBIE: (agreeing) I'm afraid you're right.     Something must
ALEX: Oh, yes,    yes....
ROBBIE: Perfect.    A work of art. The girls look at each other and smile. ALEX and ROBBIE grab the smoothies and hand two to the girls. AMY sips hers right away.
AMY: I don't remember anything like this on Aokee's menu.
ROBBIE: They're..
ALEX: (interrupting) ..special smoothies. Fortunately, you know people on the inside. Onstage, the band had finished a tune before the dialog began above. Now JAFFA steps up to the mike.
JAFFA: We'd like thank Aokee and his crew for hosting this evening's Luau. Everyone applauds, AOKEE waves. Alex raises a hand and waves off the accolade. ROBBIE nods and smiles as the AMY and KATIE clap as well.
JAFFA (CONT'D): We'd also like to bring Aokee up to sing one of his Hawaiian specialties. Again, everyone claps and cheers him on.    AOKEE goes on stage.
ALEX: You girls want to dance?
KATIE: (grabbing ROBBIE's hand and leading out to the dance floor) Sure. AMY shrugs yes and goes out with ALEX.
AOKEE: (onstage)
KATIE: So. How are things working out at Aokee's?
ROBBIE: Oh, he's great. Alex too. I thought this summer was going to be a train wreck, but it's not turning out too bad.
KATIE: Well, of course this isn't California...
ROBBIE: No, but it looks like I will get a chance to do some surfing anyway.
KATIE: Really.
ROBBIE: Apparently there's some kind of surfing contest and Aokee is all over me to enter.
KATIE: You mean the Surfer King?
ROBBIE: You've heard of it?
KATIE: It's all the other girls seem to talk about. This is my first year, but
ROBBIE: We'll see. It seems kind of stupid to me. A surfing contest in Colorado. (laughing) My friends back home would never believe it. They continue to dance. WE SEE BIG MIKE talking to TIFFANY and gesturing broadly. TIFFANY is clearly not agreeing with what he is saying. COWBOY is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly she throws up her hands and marches over to the dance floor where EDDIE is standing alone, swaying a bit to the music. She whispers something in his ear, and EDDIE'S eyes get real big as she leads him by the hand to the middle of the dance floor. She wraps her arms around EDDIE and they dance, all the while glaring at her father. EDDIE knows a good thing when he sees it, and quickly settles in, Big Man on Campus. TIFFANY is taller than he is, so he happily puts his head on HER shoulder. BIG MIKE looks back at them, not happy with the way it happened, but satisfied. DOUG FITZGERALD (twenty bucks DOUG) is dancing with a girl when ALEX, doing some kind of fancy spin to AMY, bumps into him.
DOUG: (to ALEX) Alex. Got my twenty bucks?
ALEX: Oh, Dougie. You know, I left my wallet over in my locker. I'll see you before we leave and get it to you then.
DOUG: Yeah, sure.
ALEX: You know, you could always come by Aokee's and I could give it to you in trade.
DOUG: Cash money, Alex.   Cash money.
ALEX: No problem. ALEX grabs AMY and swings her into another fancy move that leads them away from DOUG.
ROBBIE: (to KATIE) Hey, listen. Alex told me about this great spot on the other side of Thunder Bay that looks down on the party, but it's a little more quiet. Want to go for a walk?
KATIE: Sure. They pick up their smoothies and walk off into the night.
KATIE: So...what made your folks pick up from beautiful southern California and move to Colorado?
ROBBIE: Not both my folks.   Just my Mom.
KATIE: Aha...trouble in paradise?
ROBBIE: Let's just say my father had an eye for his administrative assistant, and now they're both somewhere in Mexico. Mom got a job here, some of her family's here, so they said "Colorady is the place you outta be".
KATIE: It could be worse.
ROBBIE: Well, I must admit, I've met some very nice people. (looking down and smiling) In California, the attitude's a little different. Here, not everyone is out to prove something. Seem's like everyone just wants to have fun.
KATIE: I have a theory. Sometimes it snows here so hard, that it's a challenge just to get to work or to school. Everything shuts down for a day or so. If your car gets stuck, people appear from nowhere to help pull you out and get you back on the road. Most people here don't just look out for themselves. A lot of times,
ALEX: All these switches feed sound throughout the park. Which reminds me. He pulls out a CD and pops it into the CD Player and presses PLAY. He sees a flyswatter and begins waving it around like a sword.
ALEX (CONT'D): And this is for bad little girls who don't know how to have fun. He begins swishing it around, AMY is giggling.
ALEX (CONT'D): Oops.   There....almost got you. AMY is dodging and laughing. ALEX closes in and seems like he will kiss her, but just starts gumming her neck, tickling her. AMY leans back laughing and WE SEE her back hits the volume knob on the amplifier.
KATIE: (looking down at the party) You were right. This is nice. (reacting to the jungle noises) But not necessarily quieter.
ROBBIE: Just a sec. He walks away slightly and gets on the radio.
ROBBIE (CONT'D): Hey, Alex. Give us break down here. Turn down the sound effects.
ALEX: (interrupting, but to AMY) Uh oh. Sorry. Hold that thought.
ALEX (CONT'D): (into the radio) I'm on it. He turns down the volume back to normal. He also flips a switch. They hear the tune now, and AMY jumps off the counter, stands there and smiles. ALEX does an over-the-top mambo moving to her and they start to slow dance.
ROBBIE: (quizzically) So where did you learn to dance like this?
KATIE: (smiling) Eight years at Miss Vickie's Studio of Dance. What surprises me is you.
ROBBIE: (somewhat embarrassed, keeps dancing) Can you keep my deepest, darkest secret?
KATIE: Of course.
ROBBIE: (hesitantly) When you grow up within spitting distance of Hollywood, every mother seems to think her child is the next Harrison Ford. So when I was about 12, my Mom started taking me to all these auditions for things.
KATIE: So are you the next Harrison Ford?
ROBBIE: Some days I'm not even the next Robbie Zirpollo. They continue to dance.    After a few moments...
KATIE: ....and? They stop and walk over to the railing overlooking the party.
ROBBIE: Turns out I get this part. They're selling some dish soap or something, and they think it will be magical to have two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom on this fantasy set with clouds and everything. They lock this girl and I into a dance studio with a choreographer for two weeks, and then they shoot the commercial.
KATIE: Doesn't sound so terrible.     You certainly learned how to dance.
ROBBIE: Yeah, but when it came out everyone in school saw it. I couldn't go anywhere for six months without everyone in the room laughing their heads off.
KATIE: (touched, drawing closer) I'm not laughing. They kiss, then return to dancing.
ROBBIE: (quietly) Hello? No reaction.
ROBBIE (CONT'D): (loudly this time) Hello?
PIPEMAN: Hey.   You're not supposed to be in here.
ROBBIE: Yeah, sorry. Are you Pipeman?
PIPEMAN: (recovering from the startle) Not on purpose. I guess some people call me Pipeman. 'Spose it's better than Carl.
ROBBIE: So you're real name's Carl?
PIPEMAN: No. I just said Pipeman was a better name than Carl.
ROBBIE: Oh. Well, my name's Robbie.      I work at Aokee's.
PIPEMAN: Oh. OK.   What the hell you doin' down here?
ROBBIE: I need your help.
PIPEMAN: That scrubsink at Aokee's leakin' again? Gees, I knew we shoudda replaced...
ROBBIE: It's not the scrub sink. I need your help. I'm competing in the Employee Olympics. With your advanced surfing experience, Aokee thought you might be able to help me.
PIPEMAN: (to himself) Everybody wants to be the Surfer King. (to ROBBIE) What advanced surfing experience?
ROBBIE: Well, you know. "Pipeman"? Hawaii's North Shore? Surfing the pipeline?
PIPEMAN: Ohhh. Bad news, kid. I hate to disappoint you, but this is the reason they call me Pipeman. I'm the plumber around here. PIPEMAN holds up the large wrench.
ROBBIE: Oh, boy. See, I'm from California, and I can surf, I just don't know what to expect from the wave on Thunder Bay. I...I was just hoping you could help, I really am sorry for bothering you. ROBBIE begins walking out, dejected.    PIPEMAN looks at him, and feels sorry for him.
PIPEMAN: Wait a minute, kid. I do know a little about surfing. I also know a lot about the wave here. What exactly are you looking for from me?
ROBBIE: (perking up) I need a mentor; you know like in Karate Kid.
PIPEMAN: Karate Kid. He works at Big Mike's doesn't he?
ROBBIE: No, no it's a movie.
PIPEMAN: Never seen it. Don't know much about this mentor thing. How's it work?
ROBBIE: Generally, you, as mentor, draw on some personal religious philosophy to first intimidate, and then later inspire me. What religion are you?
PIPEMAN: (proudly) I'm Norman.
ROBBIE: Ah, Brigham Young and all that.
PIPEMAN: No, no NNNNORM-AN. We follow the big fat guy on Cheers reruns.
ROBBIE: Okay...and your belief structure....
PIPEMAN: Usually involves a lot of beer and corn nuts, but I don't think that's gonna work here. (thinking) Tell you what. Meet me at Thunder Bay tomorrow morning,
ROBBIE: (happily) Great, perfect. Thanks. I won't let you down. (walking away, muttering to himself) What the heck is a corn-nut?
ROBBIE: Hi!  Glad you could make it. (pointing to PIPEMAN's hand) What's that?
PIPEMAN: This is how I trigger the wave.
ROBBIE: With that?     A garage door clicker?
PIPEMAN: What did you think? Waves just happen? This is Colorado, kid. Now get your board and get in the water. Robbie gets his board and jumps into Thunder Bay, paddling over to the narrow side where the wave begins. PIPEMAN goes down the stairs leading to near where ROBBIE has positioned himself.
PIPEMAN (CONT'D): You sure that's where you want to be?
ROBBIE: Should be about right. Aren't you getting in? Where's your board?
PIPEMAN: Mentors don't get wet. I looked it up. (pressing the clicker) Get ready. A wave comes and ROBBIE begins paddling.     He misses it,
PIPEMAN (CONT'D): Want to know what you did wrong?
ROBBIE: (mad) Just gimme another wave.
PIPEMAN: Oakey doakey. Another wave comes. ROBBIE paddles furiously and misses it again. Now he's really angry.
ROBBIE: (tersely) Okay. Please. Tell me what I did wrong.
PIPEMAN: You're in the wrong position. The wave doesn't crest that soon. Move ten feet further away from the back wall.
ROBBIE: (to himself) The ocean never had a back wall. (to Pipeman) Thank you. ROBBIE paddles over to the spot suggested by PIPEMAN. AOKEE and ALEX are now sitting on the edge of the lawn chairs anxiously awaiting the next wave. It comes and ROBBIE catches it easily and begins riding it aggressively. He has a good run and kicks out at the end. AOKEE and ALEX high-five.
ALEX AND AOKEE: (together) Yeee-haww. They settle back into their chairs to absorb some sun.
RICHARD: (grinning) So. I hear he's pretty good.     Haven't seen him myself yet.
AOKEE: (concerned, covering) Good? Good at what? Who you mean?
RICHARD: Come on. Your ringer from California. Everyone says he's gonna give Cowboy a run for his money.
AOKEE: Robbie?    Robbie barely walk without help. We hear a loud CRASH from the kitchen.
RICHARD: Gees!
AOKEE: Ha! AOKEE gestures back towards the kitchen.
AOKEE (CONT'D): Your Surfer King. We just make a good show. Your boy have nothing to worry about.
RICHARD: You know I'd feel a lot better if you hadn't taken most of my money in that poker game last Friday night.
AOKEE: (dismissive) Poker? Not an island game.     I no good.
RICHARD: (nods) Right. Tell you what. Sight unseen even money, twenty dollars on Cowboy.
AOKEE: You want to bet with me? Take my twenty dollars, just like that? Humph. Not worth the trouble, twenty dollars. Now, maybe a hundred...
RICHARD: A hundred bucks... ANOTHER CRASH from the kitchen, this time pots & pans.
AOKEE: (to kitchen) Robbie!
RICHARD: OK, a hundred bucks. They slap hands to seal the deal.    RICHARD leaves, grinning and shaking his head.
AOKEE: (to kitchen)
ROBBIE: (entering from kitchen) Sorry, dude, that tray was way off balance.
AOKEE: Robbie, our secret getting out.     You practice too good.
ROBBIE: (happy) I'm really getting the hang of that wave.
AOKEE: Fall more.     Make good show.
ROBBIE: (thinking) I'll try to remember to look and see who's watching.
AOKEE: (pours the rest of RICHARD's smoothie) Good. Here, have a smoothie. You too skinny to surf good. ROBBIE smiles and takes the smoothie back to the kitchen.
PIPEMAN: (gesturing) OK, now this time, get up on the board more quickly. This is a wave pool and this wave dissipates quickly. You only have a little time to show your stuff.
ROBBIE: How will the judging work?
PIPEMAN: You get a possible ten points. Three for your surfing, three for your style and four for the judge's overall impression of your ride. No one's ever gotten a ten...I'm not really sure why.
ROBBIE: You've seen the competition.     What does everybody do?
PIPEMAN: Everybody just surfs, man and tries not to fall. The big reason Cowboy's done so
ROBBIE: OK.   I'm ready. The wave comes and ROBBIE catches it and surfs it hard, kicking up high at the end.
COWBOY: He's pretty good, I'll give him that.
TIFFANY: (concerned) How good?
COWBOY: If I have an off day, he could win.
TIFFANY: (really concerned) That's terrible. You're the Surfer King.
COWBOY: Well, some days you get the wave, and some days the wave gets you.
TIFFANY: This can't happen.   What are we gonna do?
COWBOY: I don't know what you're going to do, but as me for me, I'm gonna schedule some practice time of my own.
TIFFANY: This may take a lot more than extra practice.
COWBOY: Well, I don't know what else you expect. I'll go out and do my best. If that's not enough, it's not enough. TIFFANY grabs the binoculars and stares down at Thunder Bay. WE SEE gears turning in her head.
ROBBIE: (to JAFFA) Hey Jaffa. NO worries. (to ALEX, shocked) People are betting on me?
ALEX: Just a little friendly pool. No big deal. Helps make this more interesting. Concessions never had a chance before...
ROBBIE: I've seen this Cowboy practice. His style is more longboard, and this is a shortboard wave, but he's still pretty good. I could lose you know. Two concessions girls are walking by them.
CONCESSIONS GIRLS: (together) Hi Robbie!
ROBBIE: How ya doin' (to Alex after they have gone by) See. How come everyone knows me by sight now?
ALEX: Ah, you're the next big thing. You'll survive it. The Employee Olympics are only a week away. What happens is we have this big opening ceremony where each team chooses a theme and we're judged on our spirit. Then different teams compete in contests that test their Water World skills. The next morning it all ends with the surf contest. You ready? Another group of concession girls calls ROBBIE from one of the snack bars. He waves.
ROBBIE: I suppose. I've been working out a strategy to use if Cowboy has a real good day. It's risky... Just then they both nearly run headlong into TIFFANY.
TIFFANY: Well, hello Robbie.
ROBBIE: (surprised) You know me?
TIFFANY: Of course I know you. It's my father's park, I try get to know everyone.
ALEX: (interrupting, eager) I'm Alex!
TIFFANY: Yes, I'm sure you are. (ignoring ALEX, back to Robbie) It's been a while since I've been to Aokee's. Do you suppose if I come down in a little while you could make some of that special chicken, what is it?
ROBBIE: The best teriyaki east of the Pacific.
TIFFANY: Yes...and one those smoothies I hear so much about?
ROBBIE: (stunned) Well, sure. I'll be working all afternoon.
TIFFANY: It's a date then.    See you later! She walks off. ROBBIE just stands there. ALEX starts walking, then comes back. Finally ALEX pushes him on the shoulder.
ALEX: Come on, we gotta get back.
ROBBIE: (still shocked) Yes. Yes we do.
AOKEE: Alex! We need more large smoothie cups out here! AOKEE continues cleaning up. ALEX shows up with a load of cups, AOKEE takes them and starts placing then.
AOKEE (CONT'D): (to ALEX) Look at that. WE SEE in a far corner of AOKEE's TIFFANY and ROBBIE in an
AOKEE (CONT'D): Second time this week. Our boy Big Man on Campus, huh?
ALEX: Big something. I hope he knows how to work without a net.
AOKEE: Well. We all grow up sometime. He not drop a tray of dishes in days. Something going right.   You think he ready?
ALEX: I guess we'll both find out on Sunday.     I sure hope so. WE SEE TIFFANY and ROBBIE again, and TIFFANY is laughing loudly at some joke ROBBIE has made.
TIFFANY: (waving him over) Robbie! ROBBIE goes over to talk to her.    WE SEE him go around to the passenger side.
ROBBIE: (shouting) Alex! I won't need a ride tonight after all. Tiff's taking me home! ROBBIE jumps in and they drive away. ALEX, AMY and KATIE are still standing on the porch of the TIME SHACK, shocked at what they've seen.
ALEX: (disbelief) Tiff?
AMY: (grossed out) Tiff?
KATIE: (forlorn, stunned) Tiff. WE SEE ROBBIE and TIFFANY drive out the gate.     We see KATIE walk slowly out of the park alone. As she is walking, we flash back to scenes of KATIE and
AOKEE: Aie, noka moka kei kai ke alo. The drums begin and the male dancers, carrying spears begin the Hawaiian war dance. The drummers sing the Hawaiian folk tune "No ka moku Kiakahi Ke Aloha". There are about 100 concessions kids in regular uniform sitting cross-legged behind them, clapping the beat in unison. The MALE DANCERS circle each other in time to the beat, gesturing a story the seems to involve some invading army. The war dance progresses until the invading warriors are defeated and the folk song ends. At the end, the kids sitting behind raise their hand and shout.
CONCESSIONS GIRLS AND BOYS: Concessions! Concessions! Concessions! Looking to the south side of the pool, we see about 50 grounds kids sitting in rows. In our foreground there are six large trash cans, with toilet plungers arranged next to them, 2 each. To our left are a line of six grounds kids in army fatigues carrying brooms as if rifles. The lead kid shouts:
LEAD MARCHER: Company!   Forward, march. THE DRILL team marches into full view. The grounds kids behind clap the march beat. The marchers stop in front of the line of trash cans.
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D): Company!   Halt! They do.
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D): Present Arms!
LEAD MARCHER: Order arms. They begin a routine practiced with brooms, in a cadence, clapped by the grounds kids behind them.
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D): What do you do if it's wet and not yours?
MARCHERS: (in cadence) Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
LEAD MARCHER: How do you deal with a full can of trash?
MARCHERS: Trash Rats!
MARCHERS: Trash Rats!
LEAD MARCHER: Sound off, Trash Rats.
MARCHERS: Trash rats! Trash Rats! They stop.     Their brooms are raised over their heads.
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D): (to the seated GROUNDS KIDS) What do you do when the table's a mess?
GROUNDS KIDS: (together) We wipe it! We wipe it!
LEAD MARCHER: What do you do when a toilet's stopped up?
GROUNDS KIDS: We plunge it! We plunge it!
LEAD MARCHER: Sound off!
GROUNDS KIDS: Trash rats!
LEAD MARCHER: Sound off!
GROUNDS KIDS: Trash rats!
LEAD MARCHER: Sound off trash rats!
GROUNDS KIDS: Trash rats! Trash rats! They clap and cheer, and settle back down to sit. All is quiet now. WE SEE concessions kids sitting, grounds kids sitting and we look to the west side of the pool and see lifeguards sitting. Everyone is looking around. Suddenly two lifeguards dressed as Roman Soldiers appear with horns. They bellow a Roman Call to Action, and two Roman drummers lead a column of other lifeguards.
LIFEGUARDS: (together) Lifeguards! Lifeguards!     Lifeguards! The guards holding COWBOY set him down in front of an elevated platform that has a microphone.. COWBOY picks up the surfer king trophy and walks to the platform. He sets the trophy on a table next to the microphone, arranging it carefully. We see now there is a large banner hanging at the back of the wave pool that says "WATER WORLD WELCOMES EMPLOYEE
OLYMPIANS".: COWBOY moves to the microphone and raises his arm in a regal manner and speaks.
COWBOY: (to all) Let the games...begin! The seated crowd now stands and cheers loudly. We see a group of three people, two male and one female, adults we will later identify as JUDGES. They nod approvingly and write something down on their clipboards. We see BIG MIKE near them, smiling broadly.
AOKEE: (looking through the papers) This isn't good. (looking at ALEX and ROBBIE) It's the same as every year. Pretty much a dead heat going into the surf championship tomorrow morning.
ALEX: I can't believe those guys screwed up the
ROBBIE: Hard to blame them. No one told them they had to put their mouth on yours until the last minute. Yuck.
ALEX: Bunch of babies.
AOKEE: (to ROBBIE) It's going to be up to you. We slip a little. You have to make up. That trophy need a new home. They look over at the obstacle course where a tiny grounds kid is jumping up and down and raising his arms ROCKY-style.
AOKEE (CONT'D): You need to make up. You ready? Tomorrow morning last event. You our last hope. ROBBIE just looks at both of them nods and sighs heavily as the other grounds kids surround our winner in the background. AOKEE and ALEX walk off. Suddenly TIFFANY appears.
TIFFANY: Hi Robbie.
ROBBIE: (shy but still very much smitten) Oh. Hey.
TIFFANY: How's your team doing?
ROBBIE: Uh.   OK, I guess.      Kind of a tie.
TIFFANY: Well, I think you're going to take care of that tomorrow morning. In fact, I've planned a little celebration in advance. We're going to this incredible party up in the foothills at some friends of mine.
ROBBIE: (intrigued) Party, huh? That sounds like fun.       I have to work until nine tonight.
TIFFANY: That's perfect. I'll come back here and pick you up. She starts to walk off.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): Oh, and Robbie...call your mom and tell her you're spending the night at Alex's or something. It's going to be a very special night.
ROBBIE: (hypnotised)
K...: She walks away. ROBBIE stands there a moment before waking up and leaving also.
ALEX: (voice somewhat hushed) I'm telling you we need to talk him. Something's going on.
AOKEE: (shaking his head no) Robbie know the right thing to do.     He's a good boy.
ALEX: So how about this? He tells me I've got to cover for him if his mother calls. He told her he's spending the night at my house.
AOKEE: He say that?
ALEX: Yes. Tiffany's got something up her sleeve and Robbie's too messed up to
AOKEE: (reflective) Spending the night at your house.      This very bad. Very bad.
AOKEE (CONT'D): He should be done with the dishes by now. Tell him we want to talk. ALEX disappears back into the kitchen. AOKEE goes to an empty table under the one light on in the dining area and sits down. ALEX comes back and ROBBIE follows.
ROBBIE: Hey. I'm done with the pots and pans. It's almost nine. Can I take off now?
AOKEE: Robbie, please, sit. ROBBIE sits down.   So does ALEX.   Robbie looks at both and gets suspicious.
ROBBIE: Everything OK?
AOKEE: That's what we gonna ask you.    What you plan tonight?
ROBBIE: Well, Tiffany invited me to a little party up in the mountains.
AOKEE: Robbie, you athlete. Big day tomorrow. You need sleep, not party.
ROBBIE: It's no big deal.   I'll be fine.
AOKEE: Is big deal. Robbie. You good boy, smart, everybody like you, but....
ROBBIE: But...
AOKEE: Face it. Only one reason Tiffany interested in you. She want to make you so tired and so crazy you lose tomorrow.
ROBBIE: (disbelief) Aw, come on...
ALEX: Robbie. She's still going out with Cowboy. I saw them together at the movies two nights ago.
ROBBIE: Maybe she's just letting him down easy.
ALEX: Robbie...things...things are not always what they seem to be.
ROBBIE: Like what?
AOKEE: In this case, she acts like she likes you when really she wants Cowboy to win.
ROBBIE: Naw. You guys are nuts.      She's not like that.
ALEX: She is like that.
ROBBIE: Look, I know what to believe and what not to. I'm not that easily fooled.
ALEX: Aokee?
AOKEE: (shaking his head) Go ahead. Tell him. I trust him.
ALEX: OK. Take Aokee for instance.      Gentle, genial Hawaiian guy, right?
ROBBIE: Sure. He's great. I love working here. Aokee, you've been real good to me...
ALEX: Then let me introduce you properly. Robbie Zirpollo, meet Manuel Ramirez. AOKEE'S head is down in his hands. Robbie looks stunned.
ALEX (CONT'D): Manuel's family snuck across the border ten years ago through Juarez, Mexico.
AOKEE: (accent gone) My father refused to work for a drug lord who ran our town. They tried to kill
ROBBIE: Aokee?
AOKEE: (accent now Mexican) A name I picked up reading an obituary in the paper. I sent away to Hawaii and got his birth records and social security number. This way, I never have to worry about immigration. I spent weeks watching tapes of Hawaii Five-O just to get the accent right. "Book 'em Danno". Huh. What's that all about?
ROBBIE: (to Alex) And you knew? ALEX nods yes.
AOKEE: I burnt my hand on the grill one day and started swearing in Spanish...
ALEX: (interrupting) And I said, boy, you speak Spanish like a native....uh oh. It's been our little secret. Now it's your secret, too.
ROBBIE: (looking at his watch) I need to think about all this.
ALEX: (nodding) You do.
AOKEE: Sleep tonight. Sleep well.
ROBBIE: (gets up, dazed) Right. Goodnight. ROBBIE leaves.     ALEX and AOKEE just sit, looking at each other.
94".: It is almost a festival atmosphere.     The JUDGES are standing
AOKEE: (to Alex) Have you seen him?
ALEX: Not yet. They are looking to the north towards the crowd, but ROBBIE appears behind them.
ROBBIE: (looking in the same direction) What you lookin' at?
AOKEE: We looking for you.        How you sleep?
ROBBIE: I slept fine. (pause as AOKEE and ALEX wait) I decided I'm not my father. I don't run out on the people I care about just because some blond shakes her ta-ta's at me.
AOKEE: (relieved) We go then. ROBBIE picks up his board, and they begin walking toward the bleachers. ALEX stops and turns suddenly.
ALEX: She shook her ta-tas? No one said anything about shaking ta-tas. (reflectively) This puts a whole new light on things! He is in ROBBIE's way.        ROBBIE pushes him with his board.
ROBBIE: Get going!
HEAD JUDGE: (looking down at clipboard) Alright, here's the deal. You get three tries; three heats. We judge each run and only your high score counts. If you fall you get no score for the run. Your score will be added to the total for your team, and the winner gets the Surfer King Trophy. Any questions? They all shake their head no.
HEAD JUDGE (CONT'D): Then let's begin. Grounds is up first. MELINDA grabs her board and begins paddling out. The wave comes and it's all she can do to stay on her board. She struggles and falls at the end. She will clearly not be a factor. The big screen shows a 0 in a column after the grounds score. We look back to the bleachers to polite applause, but the COLONEL and the grounds kids are clearly disappointed. COWBOY is out there now, the wave comes and he catches it easily. He rides the wave gracefully and well, and kicks out at the end. The big screen shows an 8 in the lifeguard row. The lifeguards and RICHARD are cheering now. ROBBIE is next. He catches the wave and rides it more aggressively than COWBOY, but nearly falls at the end of his run. The big screen shows an 8. The concessions kids and AOKEE are very enthusiastic. They can see they have a chance with ROBBIE. PIPEMAN is watching from a far corner. MELINDA begins her second run. She is a little more confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and ride the wave. More polite applause, and the big screen shows a 5. COWBOY catches his wave, and tries to imitate ROBBIE'S more aggressive style, but falls midway through the run. We hear a large gasp from the crowd as this happens. The crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive but disappointed. We see the JUDGES confer and the big screen shows a 0. ROBBIE gets his wave, and surfs it aggressively again, this time not nearly falling at all. The JUDGES nod approvingly and confer. The big screen shows a 9. The crowd goes wild, especially the concessions kids. Melinda begins her final run. She does better than the past two, but not significantly. The JUDGES confer and the screen shows a 5. The ground kids are very disappointed, they know they are out of it now. THE COLONEL shakes MELINDA'S hand and thanks her for her efforts.
BIG MIKE: (clearing his throat, flustered) It looks like we have a tie. This has never happened before, but I seem to remember we provided for this possibility in the rules. Hopefully our judges can help us figure out what to do! The HEAD JUDGE is reading to the other JUDGES out loud, slaps his hand on one of the papers and comes up to the mike.
HEAD JUDGE: Reading from the rules, "...in the event of a tie at the end of three heats in the surf competition, the teams who are tied will participate in a sudden-death surf off. Additional heats will be run until a winner can be declared." (looking up at the crowd) The "Sudden Death" heat will begin in five minutes. Everybody cheers...they're going to see some more great surfing. The JUDGES signal COWBOY and ROBBIE to come over. The head JUDGE takes a quarter out of his pocket and points to COWBOY to call it. It lands and the JUDGE looks at it. HE points to ROBBIE.
HEAD JUDGE (CONT'D): You want to go first or second?
ROBBIE: Second.
HEAD JUDGE: Be ready in five minutes.
AOKEE: So what you do?   Wait for him to go crazy and fall?
ROBBIE: Don't want to win with him falling.
PIPEMAN: You could always go out and do your very best, take a lot of chances and maybe win this thing on merit.
ALEX: (dismissive) Don't be silly. That only works in the movies.
ROBBIE: (shakes his head) Actually, that's exactly what I'm thinking. It's the reason we're in a tie. I've been too conservative. I've got to do everything I can, or just forget about it. It's all or nothing. (pause) We gotta pull the fin.
AOKEE: Pull da fin?
PIPEMAN: You think you can hold it?
ROBBIE: (explaining) One time, these tourists from Japan on the beach at La Jolla offered me a hundred bucks to do a full spin at the top of the wave, and then slide down and cut back and do a full back flip. I pulled it off. A friend of mine had a tricks board with just a single fin and foot pockets.
PIPEMAN: We gotta pull the fin. What do we do about the foot pockets?
ROBBIE: You got duct tape? PIPEMAN reaches into his tool belt and pulls out a roll.
PIPEMAN: What kind of plumber would I be if I didn't have duct tape? Water World
ROBBIE: Here and here. PIPEMAN gets his screw gun out of his tool belt and begins removing the two outer fins of the board. He then begins looping duct tap around the board to create two foot pockets. This provides a background to the dialog below.
AOKEE: So, help me understand.      What you do now?
ROBBIE: Pipeman is taking the extra fins off my board. I only need one to make a deep cut back. He is also putting some pockets to slip my feet into so when I flip upside down, I don't lose the board.
ALEX: Flip upside down?
ROBBIE: A back flip. You guys see it on snowboarders here all the time, I'm sure.
ALEX: Oh yeah, I'm sure I did that last winter. But not on purpose! Dude. You're either gonna win this thing or you're gonna die.
AOKEE: (quickly, eagerly) It would be better if you won.
ROBBIE: Yeah, well, a tie is like kissing your sister.
ALEX: (mock anger) You stay away from my sister. We hear an air horn blast.      They are ready to start.
PIPEMAN: Ready!
ROBBIE: (to PIPEMAN) I'll need the biggest wave you can give me...
PIPEMAN: (imitating Mr. Scott on Star
AOKEE: (dropping his Hawaiian accent) Robbie. When you do this, do this mostly for Robbie Zirpollo. But do it just a little bit for Manny Ramirez, eh? AOKEE smiles and pats him on the back.    Robbie nods.    They head for the bay.
ALEX: (to ROBBIE) Looks like he's waiting for you to make a mistake. You sure you know what you're doing?
ROBBIE: I'm just making this up as I go along.
ALEX: Works for me! Go get 'em. ROBBIE appears on the seawall holding his board and looking out first at the bay, then at the crowd. His mom, CONNIE waves, and he smiles weakly. HE sees KATIE and she looks hopeful. She hasn't given up on him completely. He smiles at her and gets into the water. He begins paddling. It seems to take forever for him to get out to the spot where he catches the wave, but he finally arrives. He sits there for a moment, collecting himself, then raises his hand to signal he is ready. The CONCESSIONS KIDS have started to chant, ROBBIE! ROBBIE! The guards are anxious, but even they can't help moving to the cadence of the chant. The wave comes and he catches it quickly, and slips his feet into the duct tape pockets. He misses one pocket at first, then gets it in. He rides it carefully and at the right moment slides up to
COWBOY: (disbelief) You did WHAT? AOKEE and ALEX lead him up to the grandstand. COWBOY also makes his way up there, and we see him talking to BIG MIKE. BIG MIKE nods in agreement and COWBOY goes to the mike as the crowd settles down.
COWBOY (CONT'D): As last year's Surfer King, it's my privilege to present this year's trophy to the most amazing surfer on the water today. Robbie! Congratulations. COWBOY shakes ROBBIE's hand, and ROBBIE speaks at the mike.
ROBBIE: (holding trophy) I just want to thank Aokee, Alex and Katie for all their support. We see KATIE clapping, crying.   AOKEE and ALEX are clapping and smiling.
ROBBIE (CONT'D): And I have just one thing to say to everyone in concessions. WE DID IT! ROBBIE holds the trophy high as everyone cheers.
TIFFANY: Another summer gone. How about it Robbie? You gonna guard next year?      They could use your help. They all walk closer to her car.
ROBBIE: I don't know...we have a pretty good time at AOKEE's.
TIFFANY: You know, that's what I hear. Maybe I should work there next summer. ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY all say these lines pretty much at the same time.
ROBBIE: You wouldn't like it...
ALEX: That's a bad idea...
KATIE: And you're such a good guard...
AMY: You'd be miserable...
TIFFANY: Maybe you're right.    See you around... EDDIE appears out of the time shack wearing his tuxedo t shirt.
EDDIE: (almost singing) Tiffany! He walks up to her driver's side.
TIFFANY: (feeling charitable, warmly) Hello, Eddie. EDDIE shows there is nothing in his hands, then reaches into the car and from behind TIFFANY's ear pulls a plastic Easter Egg out. He hands it to her, and she opens it. A beautiful butterfly flies out and away. She is momentarily entranced.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): You know, that's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. (pause, thinking, what the heck) Hop in Eddie, let me give you a ride home. EDDIE waves his hand for HER to scoot over so he can drive. She is surprised, but does, almost reflexively. He gets in and he looks at ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY grinning broadly as he pulls away. ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY just watch in stunned silence as EDDIE and TIFFANY drive off.
ALEX: (collecting himself) Well. Just another summer at Water World. The group begins walking toward the exit gate, as we go wide and helicopter upward. They get smaller and smaller in the shot as we hear the conversation continue.
ROBBIE: You know Katie, I really am sorry I was such a jerk this summer.
KATIE: We'll be going to the same high school. You'll have plenty of chances to make it up to me. Let's see, there's Homecoming, the Christmas Dance, Valentines Day...and of course, the prom...
ROBBIE: Alex?
ALEX: Yeah?
ROBBIE: I'm gonna need to borrow twenty bucks.
ALEX: Yep. We helicopter up for a final shot over the whole park.
