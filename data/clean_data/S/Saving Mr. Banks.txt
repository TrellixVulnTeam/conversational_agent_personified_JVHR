IN STORE: Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large, bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens. There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod. She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS ( whom we will also know as GINTY. )
HAPPENED BEFORE: Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind becomes real.
DIARMUID: Mrs Travers.
DIARMUID PAMELA: You're ready to? Like pink clouds on sticks.
DIARMUID: Excuse me?
PAMELA: The cherry blossoms
DIARMUID: The car should be here, may I use
PAMELA: ( OVER )
DIARMUID: ( PANICKED )
PAMELA: Mrs Travers.
DIARMUID: Mrs Travers, please, why ( sugaring his tone ) Why would you cancel the car?
PAMELA: I shan't be going. Diarmuid buries his face in his hands.
DIARMUID: We've been through this
PAMELA: I've changed my mind.
DIARMUID: You can't.
PAMELA: With all due respect Mr Russell I am on very good terms with my own faculty and exceedingly confident in its decision making Diarmuid's shoulders visibly sag, he lets out a long frustrated breath.
DIARMUID: You made an agreement. Do you understand? A verbal agreement.
PAMELA: Why in the world are you speaking to me as if I am a neonate?
DIARMUID: He'll what? Sue? He is most welcome to every penny I don't have.
HE'LL: He'll what? Sue? He is most welcome to every penny I don't have.
PAMELA: He'll what? Sue? He is most welcome to every penny I don't have.
DIARMUID: ( HE SIGHS )
LOOK: ( HE SIGHS )
FRIEND: Pamela snorts.
PAMELA: I know what he's going to do to her- - she'll be cavorting and twinkling! Careening towards a happy ending like a kamikaze
DIARMUID: We've been trying to do this deal for twenty years! He's agreed to both your stipulations. No animation, script approval I
PAMELA: Use her to pay my bills? If I believed in a hell I'd be sitting in its waiting room
DIARMUID: ( OVER )
PAMELA: I fired her. Diarmuid shakes his head, sighs.
DIARMUID: Of course not Polly! Pamela huffs, digs her heel into the rug.
PAMELA: Of course not Polly! Pamela huffs, digs her heel into the rug.
DIARMUID: You have only to go there and work for two weeks. Collaborate. That's it. You haven't signed the rights over, yet.
PAMELA: You must make it work Mrs Travers
DIARMUID: You must make it work Mrs Travers
PAMELA: Oh I must, must I?
DIARMUID: You need the money. I don't want you to see you ( broke ).
PAMELA: ( OVER )
DIARMUID: I am picking up the telephone Mrs
TRAVERS: Diarmuid gets up.
PAMELA: I have final say?
DIARMUID: You do.
PAMELA: ( TO HERSELF )
DIARMUID: You don't sign the papers. He cannot make the film unless you grant the rights.
PAMELA: ( TO HERSELF )
TRAVERS: Excuse me ma'am, have you seen my daughter? I was quite sure I had left her around here somewhere! Ginty giggles.
GINTY: You're right still doesn't sound quite I'm sure I have a special name for her
TRAVERS: You're right still doesn't sound quite I'm sure I have a special name for her
GINTY: You're right still doesn't sound quite I'm sure I have a special name for her
TRAVERS: You're right still doesn't sound quite I'm sure I have a special name for her
GINTY: Why, thank you ma'am! Ginty it is of course!
TRAVERS: Why, thank you ma'am! Ginty it is of course!
GINTY: It's me! Travers puts his nose right up to hers, peering into her Gosh! So it is! Well, thank goodness for that! I was positive I was going to be beheaded for losing Her Highness The Royal Princess Ginty Mc Featherfluffy!
TRAVERS: Gosh! So it is! Well, thank goodness for that! I was positive I was going to be beheaded for losing Her Highness The Royal Princess Ginty Mc Featherfluffy!
GINTY: You can't lose me!
TRAVERS: Never. I promise. I will never lose He swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through the park, neighing like a horse.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Can I help you?
PAMELA: I'm perfectly capable thank you. The flight attendant tries to help anyway.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: I'll take it Madam. I can put it up here -
PAMELA: I don't want it up there. I want it here, in the corresponding holding area for my assigned seat!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: The flight's closing in just a few moments Ma'am. I'll have to take Pamela narrows her eyes at the attendant as if to say `I dare you.' A woman, with an infant, stands up.
WOMAN: ( TO ATTENDANT )
PAMELA: ( TO WOMAN )
WOMAN: ( TAKEN ABACK )
PAMELA: Jolly good. Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at the tarmac. She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.
MARGARET: The carriage?
TRAVERS: Who needs a carriage my love? A stroll is a gift! ( beat, excited ) Everybody ready?
TRAVERS: Come along my team! We mustn't miss the train.
MARGARET: ( to her staff ) Thank you so much. For everything.
GINTY: ( TO NANNY )
TRAVERS: Walking bus! The family get into line, one behind the other, Travers in the lead.
GINTY: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The Great Western Queensland train chugs its way Westward from the verdant green of Maryborough toward the brown cake of Allora.
ALLORA: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The Great Western Queensland train chugs its way Westward from the verdant green of Maryborough toward the brown cake of Allora.
PAMELA: Oh does he indeed? She approaches the uniformed driver ( RALPH - Mickey Mouse on his lapel ) who bursts into a beaming smile.
RALPH: Travers? P.L. Travers?
PAMELA: Welcome, Mrs P.L. Travers! Welcome to the City of Angels. Pamela sneers. He grabs her bags.
RALPH: Welcome, Mrs P.L. Travers! Welcome to the City of Angels. Pamela sneers. He grabs her bags.
PAMELA: I'm perfectly capable of Oh, Ralph ushers Pamela through the doors
RALPH: Sun came out to say hello just to Don't be preposterous. Pamela sniffs the air.
PAMELA: Don't be preposterous. Pamela sniffs the air.
RALPH: chlorine and sweat. Ralph chuckles.
PAMELA: chlorine and sweat. Ralph chuckles.
PAMELA: ( TO HERSELF )
RALPH: You okay back there Mrs P.L. It's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs Oh, it's so hot.
PAMELA: It's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs Oh, it's so hot.
RALPH: No problemo! We got a brand new air conditioning system, Missus; cool you right down in no time. Just about make you feel like you're in good old Engerland again! Things they can put in cars these days ( he shakes his head in
AMAZEMENT ): Gosh almighty. Pamela presses her fingers to her temples. She looks around, finds a button, pushes it and the screen rises between passenger and driver miraculously relieving her of Ralph's ( happy as a clam ) No problemo.
PORTER: Would you like me to unpack for you To take your items from their cases and hang them in the wardrobe Young man, if it is your wish to handle ladies garments I suggest you take employment in a The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.
PAMELA: To take your items from their cases and hang them in the wardrobe Young man, if it is your wish to handle ladies garments I suggest you take employment in a The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.
PORTER: To take your items from their cases and hang them in the wardrobe Young man, if it is your wish to handle ladies garments I suggest you take employment in a The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.
PAMELA: Young man, if it is your wish to handle ladies garments I suggest you take employment in a The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.
BIGGER!: Pamela cannot contain her horror. She stares at it in disgust for a moment, and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the fruit basket. She stops still for a second before rushing over and picking them out. She turns them over in her hands before an enormous wave of panic washes over her.
TRAVERS: A palace! Complete with mighty And chickens.
GINTY: And chickens.
MARGARET: Travers puts an arm around her shoulder.
OH: Travers puts an arm around her shoulder.
TRAVERS: We'll build beautiful memories here my angel. Margaret offers him a trusting smile.
MARGARET: Travers takes Ginty and Biddy's hands and they run towards their new home. The chickens scatter.
TRAVERS: ( in the distance ) in this house you get to share a Margaret looks at the surrounding area, there's simply nothing but barren land and red dust for miles.
UNDERWATER: SPLOSH! A green bomb disturbs the tranquil surface and then another SPLOSH! We rise through the water to see Pamela on her balcony throwing the pears, one by one, into the swimmer-free swimming pool.
PAMELA: Good riddance. She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors.
QUESTION ): Well, no, I don't suppose I do She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as an ugly snort.
WALT: Don't worry! There's nothing wrong with your television set. This is a pixie bell, the sound is much too high for human ears. Tinkerbell flies into shot.
PAMELA: Off! That's how we deal with you.
RALPH: Good morning Mrs!
PAMELA: It's not Mrs, it's Oh, why do I bother? We're just not going to get it right are we?
RALPH: Will it be the same driver every ( oblivious to her tone ) Yes ma'am! I'm all yours.
PAMELA: Will it be the same driver every ( oblivious to her tone ) Yes ma'am! I'm all yours.
RALPH: ( oblivious to her tone ) Yes ma'am! I'm all yours.
PAMELA: You say it like you're surprised. Like the sun is particular about whom it appears for. It seems you think that I am responsible for it's miraculous dawning every day. For goodness sake, it's California!
RALPH: It certainly is! He gestures for her to get in.
PAMELA: ( as much to herself as
RALPH ): I would so much rather be accountable for the rain.
RALPH: Oh, that's sad.
PAMELA: Sad is entirely the wrong emotion. I shan't bother explaining why;
IT'LL SIMPLY: ( she makes gesture for flying over his head ) Okey dokey.
RALPH: Okey dokey.
PAMELA: The rain brings life!
RALPH: So does the sun.
PAMELA: Be quiet!
RALPH: Yes ma'am. Ralph starts the engine and drives away.
DON: Pamela! Good morning!
PAMELA: It is so discomfiting to hear a perfect stranger use my first name. Mrs Travers. Please. The Sherman's look at each other. Uh oh.
DON: I do apologize, Mrs Travers.
PAMELA: Co-script-writer. I shall certainly be having my say Mr. DiGraydi.
DON: Gradi. Wonderful! I welcome it.
PAMELA: If indeed we ever sign off on a Bob and Dick flash each other a look. What the fu ?
DON: Uh. Okay, so this is the rest of your team, Dick and Bob Sherman! Music and lyrics.
PAMELA: Who else?
DON: Who else?
PAMELA: Mary Poppins. Never ever just Mary. ( to Dick and Bob ) A pleasure to meet you, though I fear we shan't be acquainted for too long.
BOB: Excuse me?
PAMELA: These books simply do not lend themselves to chirping and prancing. No. Certainly not a musical. Now, where is Mister Disney? I'd very much like to get this started and finished as briskly as is humanly possible.
BOB: DICK PAMELA
DICK PAMELA: Not a music? If you'll point me in his
DON: Uh erm. Ha! We had planned a little tour of the studio for you
MRS TRAVERS: No thank you.
PAMELA: No thank you.
DON: Wanted to show the place off.
PAMELA: No one likes a show off. Pamela takes herself off in the direction of a building.
DON: Mrs Trav it's a long way to Don hurries behind her, Bob looks like he is about to murder the woman and Dick is finding the whole thing incredibly EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY The Shermans, Don and Pamela are riding through the studios on a golf buggy.
PAMELA: I am perfectly capable of walking. A couple of Disney characters ( Donald and Goofy ) bounce up to the golf cart, waving brightly. Goofy opens his arms to Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror.
DON: ( TO DOLLY )
PAMELA: ( over, to Dolly ) Would you let Mister Disney know I have arrived please? Dolly loses her smile at the terse tone, nods curtly and picks up the phone.
DOLLY: ( whispering into phone ) She's here!
DON: A word of advice Mrs Travers, if I You may. Whether I heed it or not will be another matter entirely.
PAMELA: You may. Whether I heed it or not will be another matter entirely.
DON: Wow. Uhm. It's just that he can't stand being called Mr Disney. We are all on a first name basis here.
WALT: Well, there ya are at last! Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, and makes her way serenely towards the man, who rushes down the corridor to greet her.
PAMELA: He squeezes her tight and then lets go. Pamela struggles to compose herself, she hasn't been that close to a man in Disney winces.
WALT: Walt, you gotta call me Walt, ya know. `Mister Disney' was my old There's a hint of something mournful in the way he says `old Come here! Come here! He links his arm through hers, much to her chagrin, and leads her into his interior office past an imposing floor to ceiling cabinet bursting with Academy Awards.
WALT: Tommie, say hi to the one and only P L Travers!
TOMMIE: Hi there! It's so nice to But Pamela has already been whisked through to Disney's personal office.
WALT: Have a seat, sit down. He gestures to a comfy couch in the corner but Pamela takes a seat in front of Walt's desk instead, glancing at the sign above it: We Can Make Them Live. Walt perches on the edge of the desk, close to her, gazing at her.
PAMELA: That wouldn't be appropriate. He turns a photo of his daughters - Diane and Sharon - to face Pamela.
WALT: When Diane here was seven years old I can I get you a drink? Coffee? A pot of tea would be most welc
PAMELA: A pot of tea would be most welc
WALT: ( OVER ) WALT ( CONT'D )
PAMELA WALT: I do. Twenty years!
PAMELA WALT: Yes. Twenty. So you keep I've been asking, asking,
SAYING ASKING: Pamela stops talking and waits for Disney to calm down.
PAMELA: What a charming story.
WALT: About my getting old?
PAMELA: About your daughters.
WALT: Yeah I suppose it is. ( he looks at the picture ) They're both women now. Gosh! Can you believe it?
PAMELA: Children grow up.
WALT: Now Pam, a man can't break a promise to his kids. No matter how long it takes to keep. No matter how long! You might've kept me dangling all this time but now we Gotcha indeed! Mister Disney, if you have dangled then it is at the end of a rope you have fashioned for yourself.
PAMELA: Gotcha indeed! Mister Disney, if you have dangled then it is at the end of a rope you have fashioned for yourself.
WALT: I was quite clear when you approached me the first time that she wasn't for sale and clear again when you approached me a year later and clear again when you approached me every annum for the subsequent 18 years. Honestly, I feel corralled, ensnared
PAMELA: I was quite clear when you approached me the first time that she wasn't for sale and clear again when you approached me a year later and clear again when you approached me every annum for the subsequent 18 years. Honestly, I feel corralled, ensnared
PAMELA: I was quite clear when you approached me the first time that she wasn't for sale and clear again when you approached me a year later and clear again when you approached me every annum for the subsequent 18 years. Honestly, I feel corralled, ensnared
WALT: Pam, Pam, the last thing I want is to make you feel
PAMELA: My name, if you please, is MRS You see, I promised them. That's a fact. You got kids?
WALT: You see, I promised them. That's a fact. You got kids?
PAMELA: ( OVER )
NOT: ( OVER )
WALT: ( OVER )
PAMELA: Well, that's very honourable of you
BUT: That's what being a daddy is all about right?
WALT: That's what being a daddy is all about right?
PAMELA: ( DEEP BREATH )
WALT: This movie isn't just going to make my kids happy. It's going to make ALL kids happy! You see my guys are gonna do things with it that are, well, are revolutionary. He's up again.
PAMELA: OH DEAR
OH DEAR: Pamela rubs her temples as she watches him fly about the The door opens and Tommie comes in with the tea, Walt gestures for her to bring it to him.
WALT: Mary Poppins will literally fly off the pages of your books! The door opens and Tommie comes in with the tea, Walt gestures for her to bring it to him.
PAMELA: Yes, this singing, I am glad you've come to that. ( addressing his tea
MAKING ): Milk first! Walt puts the pot down immediately like a scolded child and picks up the milk jug, he pours.
WALT: ( TAKEN ABACK )
PAMELA: She takes a sip, he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any
WALT: She takes a sip, he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any
PAMELA: She takes a sip, he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any
WALT: Oh yes she does!
PAMELA: In your books!
WALT: In your books!
PAMELA: Those aren't songs! They're recitations. She is not a giddy woman, she does not jig! Singing is frivolous and wholly unnecessary for a governess, an educatress. No. It would just ruin it. Walt is baffled. He takes a sip of tea, it's disgusting, he spits it back into his cup surreptitiously, then coughs loudly. Pamela's jaw drops.
WALT: Tell ya what. You just listen to what my Sherman boys have come up with and if they don't knock your socks off then I'm the King of Pamela rolls her eyes.
PAMELA: If you're the King of England then you shan't exist and knowing the little of you I do; I shouldn't think you would like that very Bet you would. She smirks, as does he.
WALT: Bet you would. She smirks, as does he.
PAMELA: ( BEAT )
WALT: Greensleeves huh?
PAMELA: Come to think of it. That's a song I wouldn't object to.
WALT: He's not sure if she's playing with him.
PAMELA: He's not sure if she's playing with him.
WALT: Pam, I want you to know that the last thing I would do, the very last thing, is tarnish a story I have cherished. He moves closer to her, takes her hand, she needs it for her teacup, it's awkward.
PAMELA: Quite right. She extricates her hand.
WALT: It's all in the rights agreement. As approved by your agent, Dermot.
PAMELA: Disney hands the rights agreement and a pen to her, Pamela takes it without looking and folds it up.
WALT: Disney hands the rights agreement and a pen to her, Pamela takes it without looking and folds it up.
PAMELA: ( waving the agreement ) A live action film. No animation.
WALT: Live action.
PAMELA: I'd like that on tape.
WALT: Your promise and all the discussions we have here on tape.
PAMELA: Your promise and all the discussions we have here on tape.
WALT: Tape you say. She pops the rights document in her bag. Walt's joviality, his bright demeanour, vanishes in a split second.
PAMELA: Ah there you are.
WALT: I understand. I do.
PAMELA: Well then! She stands up and smooths down her skirt.
WALT: Let's make something wonderful. She leaves his hand hanging in mid air.
PAMELA: Let's see if that's at all Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, snorts at a picture of Disney in a silly hat astride a model train and purposefully strides out of the room, a smile across her face that Disney does not see.
WALT: ( PERPLEXED ) ( BEAT )
MARGARET: It's rather late Travers continues to play.
TRAVERS: He kisses her cheek and gently lifts her from his lap.
GINTY: Good night father.
MARGARET: Good night dear. Margaret strokes her hand over Ginty's hair as the little girl slips into the house but hovers unseen by the door, watching her parents. Travers pats his knee and Margaret perches on it.
TRAVERS: I'll make us a good life.
MARGARET: Look at the stars.
PAMELA: ( peering around a vase at
DAGRADI ): What is all this jollification?
DON: We have a whole script to get through. It's gonna be a long day Mrs T. She shoots him dead with a killer stare.
PAMELA: We could save a starving country with benefaction from this room alone! Ugh, It's so vulgar. She gets up and moves the giant bouquet of flowers off the table and plops it on top of Dick's piano. Bob moves it from the piano to the floor.
BOB: ( SEETHING )
PAMELA: And these are beautiful blooms butchered for our visual and nasal enjoyment when we could have just as easily gone to the window, looked out and gazed upon them happily minding their own business and very much still alive. Bob hasn't a clue what to say. Pamela smoothes down her skirt and re-takes her seat. Everybody waits. Pamela flicks her eyes at the tape recorder which Don duly turns on.
DON: Exterior. It means the scene is taking place outside.
PAMELA: Ah, I see, an abbreviation.
DON: No, No, Mrs Travers please go Yes, I do think it's best. I've the most practise. Readings of my books you know? Anyway
PAMELA: Yes, I do think it's best. I've the most practise. Readings of my books you know? Anyway
DICK: ( LAUGHING )
PAMELA: Though I do think we should say number 17, instead of just 17, yes? It's proper.
PAMELA: I will see it. She makes a note in her script and looks to the others who are dumbstruck.
DON: Good onwards. They are interrupted by DOLLY carrying a new tray of I'm sorry to interrupt.
PAMELA: Good onwards. They are interrupted by DOLLY carrying a new tray of I'm sorry to interrupt.
DOLLY: I'm sorry to interrupt.
PAMELA: Is this a joke?
DOLLY: Excuse me?
PAMELA: Do you think you are a comedienne?
DOLLY: I'm sorry I don't understand. Dolly gingerly places the tray on the table and hovers, distributing fruit and biscuits within reachable distance.
PAMELA: Pamela shakes her head but decides to ignore Dolly and carry
DICK: We do hope so!
PAMELA: Hmmm, we'll see about that. He's totally wrong, totally and utterly.
BOB: Dick is one of the greats!
PAMELA: Dick Van Dyke? Robert, my dear, Olivier is one of the greats, Burton, Guinness - greats without ( speaking loudly into the
BERT SAYS: ( she looks to Don ) You can do Bert.
DON: ( through gritted teeth ) Thank you.
DICK: ( SINGING ) THE CONSTABLE'S
THE CONSTABLE'S: Now, how does that sound?
DICK: Now, how does that sound?
PAMELA: No no no no no no no. Dolly winces on everyone's behalf and leaves the room.
DICK: ( EXCITED )
PAMELA: Well, un-make it up. Dick quickly hides the next set of sheet music entitled:
PAMELA: EXT. FIELD - NEAR GOFF HOUSE - DAY A tiny park, about half a metre square - it has grass, tiny trees made from flowers, a small hole filled with water for a pond, park benches made with twigs and miniature wooden clothes-peg people. Ginty puts the finishing touches to the bandstand and sits back, staring in wonder. The moment is broken with the sound of hooves as her father appears, atop his horse.
TRAVERS: Ahhh, there's my girl. The horse moves up to her.
GINTY: Why did she do that?!
TRAVERS: Because she hated the sound of his Poor Uncle Albert! How can we fix We have to teach the witch how to be happy again.
GINTY: Poor Uncle Albert! How can we fix We have to teach the witch how to be happy again.
TRAVERS: We have to teach the witch how to be happy again.
GINTY: I'm not quite sure darling.
TRAVERS: I'm not quite sure darling.
AND PEEP;: And the young lie long and dream in
THEIR BED: Of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head. Travers sighs, let's the words ring in his ears, touches the end of daughter's nose.
PAMELA: Nobody walks.
RALPH: ( SADLY )
RALPH: Beautiful ain't it?
PAMELA: ( refusing him the
SATISFACTION ): If you like that sort of thing.
RALPH: I do.
DON: We do find it helps to have a visual. It's fun! She stops in front of a sketch of the Banks house.
PAMELA: No, no, no. Goodness no.
DICK: The Banks house doesn't look like that! My house is a terraced house with a pink door, white bricked with a crack in the gable. The window frames are lead-lined and the flower boxes grow pink nasturtiums to go with the pink
PAMELA: The Banks house doesn't look like that! My house is a terraced house with a pink door, white bricked with a crack in the gable. The window frames are lead-lined and the flower boxes grow pink nasturtiums to go with the pink
DOOR AND: ( gesturing to the tape
RECORDER ): Did we get that? ( to herself, slightly
HYSTERICAL ): Oh dear, it's all a big mistake. It's all wrong.
DON: It's all wrong?
PAMELA: It's too grand! The Banks family - they're normal, everyday sort of people. This isn't normal. It isn't everyday! They're not aristocrats!
DICK: Don allows a tiny smile. She is right. Pamela lingers over a picture of the parrot head umbrella, a split second of something like recognition on her face and then she simply moves on.
PAMELA: ( TO HERSELF )
DON: Um yeah?
PAMELA: Why in the world have you made Mrs Banks a silly suffragette?
BOB: I wonder if Emmeline P would agree with that adjective
PAMELA: Quite possibly, looking back. Dick mouths `oh my god!'
DON: It does seem strange that Mrs Banks allows her children to spend all of their time with the nanny when she has no job to speak of
PAMELA: Are you calling Mrs Banks No! Of course not! We just felt that if she had a job it would go some way to explaining
BOB: No! Of course not! We just felt that if she had a job it would go some way to explaining
DON: No! Of course not! We just felt that if she had a job it would go some way to explaining
PAMELA: Being a mother is a job. A very difficult job and one that not everybody is up to, that not everybody should have taken on in the first place! The boys see that Pamela is talking about something meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief moment, until
DON: I could go with Winifred.
BOB: I could go with Winifred.
PAMELA: I could go with Winifred.
DICK: I could go with Winifred.
BOB: I could go with Winifred.
PAMELA: I could go with Winifred.
DON: I could go with Winifred.
PAMELA: Yes, that's because it's very good. She comes to the next sketch and stops abruptly in front of it, a split second of utter confusion crosses her face.
DON: Ahm, yeah, that's him
PAMELA: He has a set of moustaches!
DON: In the books he
PAMELA: I told the illustrator I didn't like the facial hair but she chose to ignore me. This is MY film and this time around I shall have MY ( clearing her throat ) Mrs Travers, it was a specific request, from Walt. Pamela doesn't acknowledge that Dolly has spoken; Dolly ( to the boys ) Everyone shrugs, they don't know why.
DOLLY: ( clearing her throat ) Mrs Travers, it was a specific request, from Walt. Pamela doesn't acknowledge that Dolly has spoken; Dolly ( to the boys ) Everyone shrugs, they don't know why.
PAMELA: ( to the boys ) Everyone shrugs, they don't know why.
BOB: Does it mattterrrrrrr?!
DON: Bob, Bob, Bob Pamela stares at Bob.
PAMELA: You can wait outside! She points at the door, ordering him out with her finger. Bob is literally stunned. Dick stifles a laugh.
PAMELA: ( TO DICK )
DICK: He got shot.
PAMELA: Hardly surprising. Pamela smiles sweetly.
GINTY: Why do you do that?
TRAVERS: For you my dear! ( he flicks the blade in the air like a swordsman ) Swish! Which kind of kisses do you prefer Gintamina? Swoosh! Scratchy ones or silky ones?
GINTY: ( THINKS )
PAMELA: And again.
DICK: It's something to say when you don't know what to say!
PAMELA: Well I always know what to say. The slamming of a piano lid. Dolly pushes the door open with her foot.
DISNEY: Hit me with it.
DOLLY: She has a lot of ideas.
DISNEY: Ya? What kind of ideas?
DOLLY: About how she, uh, sees things.
DISNEY: And just how does she `see' things? Dolly sighs and pulls out a note pad.
DOLLY: ( READING )
WALT: Okay that'll work.
DOLLY: She won't approve Dick Van Dyke. Walt laughs, Dolly allows herself a little giggle too.
WALT: I asked for that.
DOLLY: Yes. They did tell her but she wants to know why.
WALT: Because I asked for it.
DOLLY: Right. Of course. Uh the tape measure Mary Poppins uses to record Jane and Micheal's height must be a roll tape, not a ruler, we must add gravi gravitas, she says.
DISNEY: Gahd! Anything else?
DOLLY: She only wants green vegetables and broth, I don't know what that is but she wants it in the room from now on and oh! She doesn't want the colour red in the film at all.
PAMELA: I've simply gone off the colour. Their mouths are agape.
DISNEY: We can't make the film without the colour red! It's set in London for pete's sake.
PAMELA: There's buses and mail boxes and guards uniforms heck! The British flag! Pamela, I'm not sure why
DISNEY: There's buses and mail boxes and guards uniforms heck! The British flag! Pamela, I'm not sure why
YOU'RE: I understand your predicament Mr Disney, I do. I just hm I don't know what it is, I'm just suddenly very anti-red. I shan't be wearing it ever again. Disney comes and sits on the table in front of Pam and locks eyes with her.
PAMELA: I understand your predicament Mr Disney, I do. I just hm I don't know what it is, I'm just suddenly very anti-red. I shan't be wearing it ever again. Disney comes and sits on the table in front of Pam and locks eyes with her.
DISNEY: Is this a test Pam? Are you requiring proof of how badly I wanna make you happy so that we can create this beautiful thing Pamela averts her eyes for a split second, embarrassed about `creating something beautiful' with Walt, but quickly recovers and eyeballs him right back.
PAMELA: I took you at your word Mr Disney and it seems my first stipulation has been denied. There will be many more, so perhaps we should just call it quits and I should hand you back these? She takes the rights agreement out of her bag and offers it to him. Disney smiles at Pamela.
DISNEY: Alright. No red in the film. Pamela glances at the tape recorder.
DON: Don and the Shermans can't believe he has given in! Disney strides out of the room.
DICK: Don and the Shermans can't believe he has given in! Disney strides out of the room.
BOB: He doesn't have the rights All three turn their heads to turn to her.
PAMELA: Pamela smiles a broad satisfied smile at the boys, smooths down her skirt and opens the script.
DICK: Yeah, do nanny. Dick begins to play
DON: Yeah, do nanny. Dick begins to play
BOB: ( SPOKEN )
DICK: ROSY CHEEKS BOB PAMELA
ROSY CHEEKS: BOB PAMELA
BOB PAMELA: No warts! Who in the world put that Play games, all sorts! Hm.
WITTY: very sweet and fairly pretty
TREATS: Bob and Don are trying to stop themselves from laughing as Dick barrels right over everything Pamela says, almost as if the two of them are doing a duet.
GRUEL: Dick grimaces ( a la Michael Banks. )
BOB PAMELA: And never smell of barley What in the world does water smelling of barley water have
BOB: You wrote that in your book! She wrote that in her!

DICK: Hurry, Nanny!
MANY THANKS: Jane and Michael Banks: Jane and Michael Banks.
PAMELA: Well I simply don't know what to say. That's the worst song I've ever heard.
DICK: INT. DISNEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON Walt stands looking out of his window.
WALT: Tommie appears in his office with a glass and hands it to
TOMMIE: Scotch Mist.
WALT: What do you think?
TOMMIE: What do I think I what?
WALT: You're a woman.
TOMMIE: That's a canny observation Walt.
WALT: What am I missing?
TOMMIE: You think the female of the species has some kind of psychic insight when it comes to others of her Walt continues to stare out of the window.
WALT: ( UNDER )
BARMAN: Good afternoon Ma'am. What can I fix you?
PAMELA: A pot of tea.
BARMAN: Sure thing. Pamela looks around at the other women in the bar, all glamorous, coiffured, very different to the practical Mrs The tea pot arrives.
PAMELA: Thank you. Tea is a balm for the soul don't you agree? But the barman has already moved on to another patron. Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come and go. The barman talks with another customer further along the bar. Nobody notices Pamela. In this setting she looks like a little old lady, awkwardly perched on a stool, staring into her empty cup.
GINTY: Thank you. A bank worker tips his hat to the gentleman.
BANK WORKER: Good afternoon Mr Belhatchett. Cashiers look up from their posts and nod courteously. Ginty and RANDOLPH BELHATCHETT are startled for a second by a loud crash. Their eyes flit to the glass door of Travers' office. The etching on the glass reads:
TRAVERS: ( TO CLERK )
CLERK: And Mr Belhatchett has complained that I opened his stupid bank five minutes late has he? Hahaaa! ( in a comedy voice ) Time's Money, Goff, y'know! Time's money my man! The clerk laughs nervously.
SIR: And Mr Belhatchett has complained that I opened his stupid bank five minutes late has he? Hahaaa! ( in a comedy voice ) Time's Money, Goff, y'know! Time's money my man! The clerk laughs nervously.
TRAVERS: And Mr Belhatchett has complained that I opened his stupid bank five minutes late has he? Hahaaa! ( in a comedy voice ) Time's Money, Goff, y'know! Time's money my man! The clerk laughs nervously.
RANDOLPH: I want you gone. All eyes fall upon the little girl whom everyone seems to have forgotten. Travers is overcome with embarrassment and Sweet thing! What are you doing Ginty looks up at Belhatchett and the manager.
TRAVERS: Sweet thing! What are you doing Ginty looks up at Belhatchett and the manager.
GINTY: You said today was
TRAVERS: Ice cream day! Yes! I did! What kind of father am I?
GINTY: ( SCARED )
TRAVERS: Ah, yes it does seem that
RANDOLPH: ( TO GINTY )
TRAVERS: ( TO GINTY )
RANDOLPH: If you can't straighten up for your own sake. Do it for your daughter. ( muttering to himself ) Travers holds out his arms to Ginty and she runs into them.
TRAVERS: Ice cream is so rare because it only comes from Siberian cows. Did you know that?!
TRAVERS: We share a Celtic soul, you and I. This world is just an illusion, Ginty old girl. As long as we hold that thought dear, they can't break us. Money, money, money. Don't you buy into it Ginty! It'll bite you on the bot! How did we end up here eh? Look at it. Barren. Breathless. Get as far away from this place as possible my love. Find yourself a patch of green.
PAMELA: ( INTO PHONE )
EXPECTED: ( BEAT )
DECIDE: ( BEAT )
DICK: It's gotta be like a slogan!
BOB: Her prescription for life.
DICK: Yeah! Yes! A stitch in time!
BOB: An apple a day.

DICK: No ouch.
BOB: No ouch.
DICK: No ouch?
BOB: Sugar. They put it in a cube.
DICK: Medicine in sugar?
BOB: Cube's an odd word.
DON: ( UNDER )
WALT: May I walk with you?
PAMELA: I'm sure your country doesn't have any laws about sharing a pavement. As they walk the sound of the piano filters out of the rehearsal room window and down onto the lot.
BOB: Go back to the chorus.
BOB: Wait! WAIT! She always does what's She goes UP the bannisters. Dick is confused.
KEY ): Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. Don looks up from his sketching.
DICK: The sound of Walt's cough signals his imminent arrival.
DON: Man is in the forest. Pamela and Walt enter the room.
DICK: It's just a chorus
BOB: Tell us what you think. He knows dum dum Will help dum dum dum duuuum! Bob whistles what will end up being the Robin's part of the Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down the medicine go do-own, medicine go down Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down In a most de da dee daaa!
DICK: ( SINGING )
BOB: We'll work out the other lyrics.
DICK: You see how it goes up on the word On the word down it goes up!
BOB: On the word down it goes up!
PAMELA: ( UNHAPPY )
DON: It's ironic.
PAMELA: Is it?
WALT: Forget ironic, it's iconic. Pamela rolls her eyes.
PAMELA: ( SARCASTIC )
WALT: I won't be able to stop singing that for weeks!
PAMELA: It seems enormously patronising to me. The very sort of annoying tune you would have playing in your themed park I daresay. All giddy and carefree, encouraging children to face the world unarmed. All they need is a spoon and some sugar and a brain full of fluff and they're equipped with life's tools. Dick is completely deflated.
WALT: What's your point Pam?
PAMELA: MRS Travers! My point is that, unlike yourself, Mary Poppins is the very enemy of sentiment and whimsy. She is truthful, she doesn't sugar coat the darkness in the world that these children will eventually come to know. She prepares them for it, she deals in honesty. One must clean one's room; it won't magically do it itself! She waves the script in the air.
WALT: No whimsy or sentiment says the woman who sends a flying nanny with a talking umbrella to save the You think Mary Poppins is saving the children Mr Disney? Pamela sighs, shakes her head.
PAMELA: You think Mary Poppins is saving the children Mr Disney? Pamela sighs, shakes her head.

TRAVERS: ( CALLING )
GINTY: She runs at him and swings her high into the air with one arm, catching Biddy with the other.
MARGARET: What a lovely surprise! Did you finish early?
TRAVERS: I couldn't stop thinking about my beautiful girls on this beautiful day in this beautiful place and I thought to hell with it! ( to Ginty and Biddy ) And what do we say about beauty A thing of beauty is a joy forever!
MARGARET: Buts are for goats my love! He dips her and smooches her.
BUT: Buts are for goats my love! He dips her and smooches her.
TRAVERS: Buts are for goats my love! He dips her and smooches her.
TRAVERS: ( whispering to Margaret ) I'll put in extra hours tomorrow.
GINTY: The hen got out and we've been trying to catch her! Travers spies the clucking demon.
TRAVERS: That's no hen! That's Aunt Ellie, your mother's horrendiferous That's a made up word!
GINTY: ( LAUGHING )
BIDDY: Not the aunt!
GINTY: Not the aunt!
MARGARET: I'll wash them again my love! Margaret look at the dirty sheets and shrugs. The kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the poor little hen runs for its life. Even the dog joins in, Margaret goes to retrieve the discarded jacket and sees a whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket, she slips it back inside - out of sight, out of mind.

DICK: Though her words are simple and few listen, listen, she's calling to

EXEMPLARY: Then came this person, with chaos in her wake And now my life's ambitions go with one fell blow It's quite a bitter pill to take.
WALT: Inspired by someone we know?
DICK: ( FEIGNING INNOCENCE )
WALT: She won't.
DICK: You don't know that.
WALT: I do. I know it, I know it only too I've fought this battle from her side. Pat Powers, he wanted the mouse and I didn't have a bean back Dick raises his eyebrows.
TRAVERS: Ahh the Countess Mary Sparklestick! Pray tell me, what are you concentrating so hard on?
GINTY: I am laying eggs!
TRAVERS: Really!? Fabulous!
GINTY: Today I am a hen.
TRAVERS: Indeed! I can see the feathers sprouting as we speak! Margaret steps out onto the veranda, takes one look at her husband and knows he is drunk.
MARGARET: Helen Goff, would you lay the table for supper please?
GINTY: I'm not Helen!
TRAVERS: ( OVER )
MARGARET: I need ( help. )
TRAVERS: She's laying!
MARGARET: ( her face contorts in
PAIN ): I'm sorry! She goes back indoors and slams the door behind her. Ginty gets up to go indoors and Travers catches her by the arm. He swallows hard, eyes welling.
TRAVERS: ( urgent, his voice
BREAKING ): Don't you ever stop dreaming Ginty my love. You can be anyone you want to be. Anyone.
GINTY: I want to be like you.
TRAVERS: ( HE CHOKES )
OMITTED: INT. LIMO - MORNING Ralph looks at Pamela in his rear-view, she seems weak, the steely fight flown away on the East wind. Her arms wrapped around her chest, her face turned to the window.
RALPH: Ya alright Mrs? Pamela doesn't even hear him.
MRS CORRY: Helen Goff? Wake up dear. You want your banner to be ready for the fair don't you? Ginty turns back to her painting - her banner reads:
ALLORA FAIR: Around the words Ginty is painting a gorgeous carousel with stunning horses, one of which is white with roses on its INT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY Margaret, Biddy and Ginty walk into the fairground. Tents are erected, farmers show off their sheep, children clutch sticks of cotton candy and a carousel spins with one stunning white horse amongst the drearier others, roses upon its bridal.

MARGARET: ( a flutter of pride ) He is indeed! On behalf of the INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING Pamela stares out of the window, not really concentrating on what's going on in the room.

CONQUEST: Margaret nudges him as Randolph Belhatchett and his family walk past.
TRAVERS: ( clears his throat ) Mr Belhatchett. Randolph looks at Travers, then at Travers shaking hands, his family nod and move on. Margaret looks upset by this.
MARGARET: Travers, Biddy's stomach
TRAVERS: Oh, for Gods' sake, Meg, stop whinnying like an old nag will you? Margaret is aghast at being spoken to like that in public but she keep her mouth shut. Ginty notices Travers eyes stray towards the refreshments Father will you ride the carousel with me!? But the refreshment tent has Travers in its grip.
GINTY: ( PANICKED )
TRAVERS: Meet you there in a blink of an INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY As before.

TRAVERS: Not now Biddy!
GINTY: I'm Ginty.
TRAVERS: Ginty! Shoo! Devastated, Ginty doesn't know what to do, she pulls at his shirt sleeve again.
GINTY: You said don't give up. A waiter approaches and takes her by the arm, leading her Excuse me, Miss. It's gentlemen only in this section of the tent. I think you'll be more comfortable at the far end.
WAITER: Excuse me, Miss. It's gentlemen only in this section of the tent. I think you'll be more comfortable at the far end.
GINTY: ( TO WAITER )
TRAVERS: Good afternoon, distinguished guests, our biggest supporter Mr Randolph Belhatchett and his lovely wife, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! Randolph looks at Travers with displeasure and then at one of the bank staff.
RANDOLPH: Why is he speaking for the bank?
BANK WORKER: He's the manager.
TRAVERS: I'm honoured to be here on behalf of the Belhatchett Bank of Australia. Shortly, it will be my very pleasant duty to present the awards to our young performers. But before I begin, I'd like to say a very few words to our very youngest citizens about the role of the - er, the Bank in our community. Ginty allows herself to breathe. So far, so good.
MARGARET: He's using too many `verys'. He always says `very' too much when
HE'S: She can't say it. Ginty takes her mother's hand but Margaret pushes the hand away.

SEMIANNUALLY: EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS Travers is now in lip synch with Dick Sherman.
COMMANDS COMMANDS: INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS Don is up and singing with the boys. They are enjoying themselves so much that they don't notice Pamela's eyes well

( looks at Ginty ) How old are you? Come up here. Ginty - what? Me? Ginty glances to her mother and then, on trembling legs, makes her way forward and up the stairs onto the dais. Margaret watches, growing uneasy.
DON: I love it!
DICK: You think Walt's gonna like it? Pamela takes a last look at the Mr Banks picture and spins around viciously.
PAMELA: Why did you have to make him so The boys jubilance is halted immediately.
DON: Who are we talking about? I'm You all have children yes?
PAMELA: You all have children yes?
DON: DICK BOB
DICK BOB: Yep. Yes.
PAMELA: And do those children write you letters, make drawings for you?
DON: Of course.
DICK: Mine like to make folded paper
PAMELA: ( cutting him off ) And would you tear up those gifts? In front of them?! Silence. They know where this is going.
PLEASE DON'T: The boys are shocked at the level of upset.
TRAVERS: I don't suppose there's any more you can give me for the pain? The doctor shakes his head at Travers wanton greed for more.
DOCTOR: ( leaving the room ) When will enough be enough Travers?
GINTY: I've brought you something father.
TRAVERS: Be a darling Ginty my old pal! Help father out won't you? Ginty is wary.
GINTY: Mother took it away. Travers slams his fist on the bed, scaring Ginty.
TRAVERS: Nervous, hopeful, Ginty withdraws a folded sheet of paper from her pocket.
GINTY: I wrote a poem for you. It - it won first prize, at school. Travers takes the page, tries to hold it steady in his shaking hand.
TRAVERS: It's hardly Yeats, is it? Ginty is devastated. But more than this there's a hardening in her small face, a sense of disillusionment that so far she's held in check. Here are the first signs of the Pamela to come.
DON: Mrs Travers! He stops, recognizing she doesn't need to be followed.
RALPH: Pamela looks up, her eyes are red rimmed but she's not He hands her the tea in a takeaway cup.
PAMELA: It's blasphemy to drink tea from a paper cup. Ralph, shifts nervously from foot to foot. He's not quite sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea. Pamela puts the tea down and continues to fiddle with bits and pieces of twig and bloom that she's plucking from the area around her.
RALPH: Everything okay Ma'am? Would you like me to drive you home?
PAMELA: All the way to England? Yes, Ralph lowers himself onto his haunches.
RALPH: You got family back there Mrs?
PAMELA: You're an impertinent man you know? You ask an awful lot of questions that have no relevance to you being able to carry out your duties.
RALPH: ( LAUGHING )
PAMELA: And you have no barometer. Ralph is confused.
RALPH: MA'AM; I
MA'AM; I: Ralph sees that she has a little collection of things, he looks around for some more. Pamela takes a stick and digs a small line through the grass then hands it to him.
PAMELA: Make a little furrow, there. Ralph dutifully does as he's told, looking over his shoulder for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil. Ralph pokes the ground, thinking.
RALPH: I gotta kid.
PAMELA: Well, most people do.
RALPH: Jane she's got all kinds of Pamela raises an eyebrow.
PAMELA: Now look. She takes the lid, twigs now sticking out of the poked holes and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of Pamela's tiny parks, she gently rest a leaf on the twig struts forming a roof.

GINTY: Margaret leaves the room and Ginty is straight out of bed following her. Behind, in the room, Moya has awoken and is EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - NIGHT Ginty runs out onto the porch where she sees her mother in her white nightdress striding purposefully through the garden like some ethereal ghost.
GINTY: She runs out into the yard but stops as she hears Biddy.
GINTY: ( CALLING )
BIDDY: Where's ma?
GINTY: Once upon a time there were three little girls alone in a house. They were frightened of the big wide world just outside the door. She takes them through the hallway, stopping momentarily outside the door to her fathers bedroom. It is slightly ajar and he looks incredibly frail and delirious.
SEE US": EXT. LIVING ROOM - GOFF HOUSE - NIGHT Biddy and Moya are calming as Ginty places the girls in front of the fireplace.
GINTY: And who do you think those sparkling messengers sent? Who was it that came flying through the starry, starry sky to carry us up to see them? Ginty wraps Moya in a blanket and puts her in Biddy's arms.
BIDDY: An elf?
GINTY: Their old Uncle Albert of course! ( beat, to Biddy ) Stay right here, be good Ginty climbs atop the horse.
BIDDY: Are you going to the sky?
GINTY: I'm going to find the end of the story so I can bring it back for Is it happy?
BIDDY: Is it happy?
MARGARET: Sometimes a person we love, through no fault of his own, can't see past the end of his nose.
GINTY: It's time to go home, ma. She reaches out her hand
OMITTED: INT. SUITE - EVENING Pamela looks through a stack of books intently, jotting something down on a piece Beverly Hills Hotel stationery every now and then. Presently, the phone rings. Pamela almost jumps out of her skin. She rushes to grab it.
PAMELA: ( INTO PHONE )
WALT: ( coughs into phone ) INTERCUT BETWEEN PHONE CALLS AS NECESSARY. Mr Disney.
PAMELA: ( DISAPPOINTED )
WALT: Callin' to check up on you.
PAMELA: Are you a doctor?

PAMELA: What can I do for you Mister Please, I beg of you, please please call me Walt.
WALT: Please, I beg of you, please please call me Walt.

WALT: Oh come on! When does anybody get to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney himself?!
PAMELA: Disappointments are to the soul what the thunderstorm is to the Walt slams the phone down. Pamela stares at it in shock!

RALPH: Oh! Isn't that nice? Holy mackerel! Wowzers. Never met him myself but there he is! Right there. Real. Living, breathing. Oh boy!
WALT: Welcome to the Magic Kingdom! Pamela steps out of the car and her eyes nearly pop out of her head with brightness of the place, unbelievable colour and excitement.
PAMELA: Is it all like this? Pamela pops a headache pill.
WALT: Yup! Isn't it wonderful? Ralph hovers at the car, filling his eyeballs with as much Walt Disney as he can get before he has to drive away.
PAMELA: Do you always get everything you want Walter?
WALT: Pretty much!
PAMELA: With the exception to the rights to my books of course!
WALT: War ain't over yet Pam! Walt takes Pamela by the arm and leads her through the gates and a murmur goes through the crowds as they gawp. A YOUNG WOMAN breaks free and rushes up to Walt.
YOUNG WOMAN: I love you so much! Can I? She proffers a pen and paper but Walt is prepared, he takes a signed postcard with his face on it from his top pocket and hands it to the woman.
PAMELA: ( DISGUSTED ) ( TO WOMAN )
WALT: ( TO WOMAN )
WALT: In Adventureland there is a tree this is a fun fact. A titbit.

WALT: ( OVER )
PAMELA: And they said only God could make a Pamela rolls her eyes. There is a protracted silence as they walk, both encompassed by their own thoughts. The sunshine, the joyful crowds just background colour. They pass by a store front and Walt glances up at the window. It reads: Elias Disney Contractor Est. 1895. Pamela notices the look but doesn't say anything.

PAMELA: No thank you. I'm happy to watch.
WALT: No greater joy than that seen through the eyes of a child. Pamela looks at the children climbing onto the carousel.
PAMELA: Maybe in you Mister Disney, but certainly not I.
WALT: Get on the horse Pamela! Pamela sighs and allows Walt to help her onto the horse.
PAMELA: I said what?
WALT: Mary Poppins, the Banks's, they're The boys have had an idea for your Mister Banks. I think it'll make you happy.
PAMELA: You brought me all the way out here to tell me that?
WALT: No. I brought you all the way out here for monetary gain. Had a wager with the boys that I couldn't get you on a ride. I win! He clambers onto his own horse, gestures to the ride controller and off they go! Pamela gently bobs up and down, Walt waves to her and she sees the unbridled thrill from the child in Mister Disney spilling out. The tiniest, tiniest of smiles threatens to surface on her lips as he points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars.
ELLIE: Well begun, is half done! His face softens as his hazy gaze falls upon Ginty, outside the window, sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken understanding of what is to come, before his close with tiredness.
DON: Good morning Mrs Travers! She looks at the new arrangement of the room.
PAMELA: What horrors have you in store for my beautiful characters today, hm? Bob clenches a fist but Dick gives him a look that says: keep Now, Mrs Travers you sit here. He ushers her to a chair facing the centre of the room. He hands pages to Bob and pages to Dolly. Don and Dolly drop to their knees so that they are half the height of Bob. Pamela raises an eyebrow.

DOLLY: ( AS JANE )
PAMELA: ( TO HERSELF )
DICK: ( SINGING )
SOARING: Up through the atmosphere Up where the air is clear Oh let's go fly a kite Don notices Pamela's foot tapping, he stands up.
DON: And then Mrs Banks goes to fetch her suffragettes ribbon.
DOLLY: ( as Mrs Banks ) "A proper kite needs a proper tail don't you think?!" Don drops to his knees again.
SOARING: Don bows to Pamela puts his hand out to her and to his surprise, she accepts and they begin to waltz. Pamela is surprisingly elegant and accomplished.
DICK: When you send it flying up there All at once you're lighter than air Dolly breaks away and rushes from the room.
DOLLY: Mr Disney! Walt! Walt spins around.
SOARING: Up through the atmosphere Up where the air is clear Oh let's go fly a kite! They all collapse in a heap, exhausted and thrilled.
PAMELA: Yes! He fixes the kite! Oh, I love Dick punches the air.
BOB: Yes! He fixes the kite! Oh, I love Dick punches the air.
PAMELA: Yes! He fixes the kite! Oh, I love Dick punches the air.
BOB: Did we get that on tape? Everybody sighs with relief and Pamela looks to the caricature of Mr Banks with deep warmth.
TRAVERS: Look at you all ship shape. Travers reaches up a shaking hand and musses up Ginty's perfectly plaited hair.
GINTY: I re-wrote the poem father. Travers doesn't respond. Ginty reaches into her pocket, takes out tuppence.
TRAVERS: ( BARELY AUDIBLE )
PEARS: INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT Pamela sits bolt upright in bed, panicked.
PAMELA: EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY Ginty skips off the porch, clutching her tuppence. Chattering to herself about pears.
PAMELA: Do you know you're quite right? It is beautiful. Exquisite.
RALPH: It's always new.
DON: ( TO PAMELA )
PAMELA: As you wish. Pamela is genuinely curious.
BOB: Are you serious?
PAMELA: I've heard about his implausibly leaved trees so I assume he does have some insane penguin wrangling scheme but it does seem rather far fetched. Can you train penguins?
DON: ( LAUGHING )
ACTUAL: ( OVER )
DICK: ( OVER )
PAMELA: He draws a little squiggle in the air to illustrate his Pamela's face turns beetroot red, she pushes herself away from the table and storms out of the room, slamming the door behind her.

DICK: What? Are we getting real penguins?
DOLLY: Good afternoon Mrs Travers!
PAMELA: Where is Mister Disney?
DOLLY: If you'd like to take a seat
PAMELA: I would not like to take a seat thank you. I would like to She heads for Disney's office and Dolly is up and running after her down the corridor.
DOLLY: Mrs Travers, please! Pamela blows past Tommie's desk.
PAMELA: INT. WALT'S OFFICE - DAY Pamela pushes open Walt's doors, catching him in the midst of signing a stack of postcards of his grinning face, an unlit cigarette in his pen hand.
DISNEY!: INT. WALT'S OFFICE - DAY Pamela pushes open Walt's doors, catching him in the midst of signing a stack of postcards of his grinning face, an unlit cigarette in his pen hand.
TOMMIE: Walt, I'm so sorry.
WALT: Don't worry Tommie, please close the door. Disney gestures to his cigarette.
PAMELA: I shall not sit in the seat of a trickster! A fraudster! A sneak!
WALT: MRS TRAVERS. PLEASE! Mrs Travers, what in the world has upset you so?
PAMELA: MRS TRAVERS. PLEASE! Mrs Travers, what in the world has upset you so?

PAMELA: You promised me. You promised me that this film would not be an And it isn't!
WALT: And it isn't!
PAMELA: So they're real penguins?
WALT: No they're animated.
PAMELA: ( SUDDEN REALIZATION )
RUEFULLY ): You foolish old woman. Pamela reaches into her purse and pulls out the assignment of rights papers and leaves them on the table.
WALT: Pam! Pamela! Mrs Travers! Wait!
PAMELA: Please call my driver and have him pick me up.
DOLLY: Yes ma'am, when?
PAMELA: EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - DAY Pamela flees to her bench, wrapping her arms around herself. Disney comes after her.

WALT: Please Mrs Travers You must You shouldn't make promises you can't keep, especially to children, they hold on to them you see? And those promises they just sit there inside of them, like little doses of poison, all those broken promises, eating away forever.
PAMELA: You shouldn't make promises you can't keep, especially to children, they hold on to them you see? And those promises they just sit there inside of them, like little doses of poison, all those broken promises, eating away forever.
WALT: Pamela? I don't understand why this is so hard for you. Please, make me
UNDERSTAND: The books weren't written for the children. They were written for the promise breakers.

WALT: The promise breakers? Mrs Travers I-
RALPH: Woah! Mister Disney!
WALT: Hi! I'm such a huge fan. It's such an honour to He suddenly sees that Pamela is more deeply entrenched in herself than usual and his priority becomes her.

PAMELA: I can't, he's
DISNEY: I just Goodbye Mr Disney. She goes to get in the car and Disney puts a hand to stop her but Ralph blocks it.
PAMELA: I just Goodbye Mr Disney. She goes to get in the car and Disney puts a hand to stop her but Ralph blocks it.
RALPH: The lady's ready to go now sir. Walt steps away and Ralph closes the door to the car.
WALT: Walt watches the car disappear, wracked with frustration and confusion. He takes a seat on Pamela's bench and wraps his arms around himself and looks to the sky.
RALPH: It's been a pleasure driving you No one likes a fibber.
PAMELA: No one likes a fibber.
RALPH: ( CHUCKLES )
PAMELA: You found out?
RALPH: I was telling my daughter all about my day and how I was driving this nice writer lady, Mrs Travers for Mr Disney and

PAMELA: I'd be honoured. Ralph hands her his pen and she begins to write.
RALPH: Uh huh. Like the girl in the book.
PAMELA: Uh huh. Like the girl in the book.
RALPH: Uh huh. Like the girl in the book.
PAMELA: ( reading as she writes ) To Jane and her dearest father ( she looks at him ) I've just this instant realized I don't know your name.
RALPH: She shakes his hand.
PAMELA: You're the only American I have ever liked, Ralph. Ralph is chuffed to bits.
RALPH: You're the only American I have ever liked, Ralph. Ralph is chuffed to bits.
PAMELA: You're the only American I have ever liked, Ralph. Ralph is chuffed to bits.
RALPH: May I ask why?
PAMELA: No. Now take this She hands him the piece of Beverly Hills Hotel stationery with her notes on.
RALPH: ( READING )
PAMELA: They all had difficulties. Jane can do anything that anyone else can do, do you understand? Ralph looks at her in awe.
RALPH: Walt Disney!
PAMELA: Deficiencies in concentration and hyperactive behavior. Explains Pamela turns to leave.
RALPH: Thank you Mrs. Pamela doesn't look back.
WALT: She's gone? Tommie looks down at her paperwork and nods at Walt Flight left 10 minutes ago. Tommie hands him the itinerary, he glares at it.
TOMMIE: Flight left 10 minutes ago. Tommie hands him the itinerary, he glares at it.
WALT: ( expecting to read her
NAME ): PAMELA TRA ( BEAT )
PAMELA TRA: ( BEAT )
TOMMIE: Her. That's her real name. Walt is confused.
DOLLY: Yuh, didn't you know? She's all hoity toity. British this and British that and she's really an Aussie called Helen Goff. Stuck up
WALT: Then who's Travers? Tommie and Dolly look at each other and shrug.
MARGARET: Ginty cannot react. Margaret sweeps her into her arms and Ginty drops the brown paper bag; it tears and scatters pears all over the floor. Ginty's eyes fix on Aunt Ellie's umbrella on the back of the chair, drawn into its beady black eyes.
DADDY: Ginty cannot react. Margaret sweeps her into her arms and Ginty drops the brown paper bag; it tears and scatters pears all over the floor. Ginty's eyes fix on Aunt Ellie's umbrella on the back of the chair, drawn into its beady black eyes.
GINTY: I want to see my father.
MARGARET: No, you mustn't.
GINTY: I want to see him! Suddenly she turns into a wildcat - lashing, thrashing, biting, screaming. Nothing will stop her seeing Travers.
AUNT ELLIE: Let her go Margaret. Margaret is forced to let go and Ginty runs for her father's INT. TRAVERS' BEDROOM - DAY Ginty stands in the bedroom, a long way from the bed. She stands there, it seems, for an eternity. Then, finally, step by step she draws closer. The empty bottle on the floor. The sheets twisted, still wet with sweat, flecked and spotted with blood. The front of her father's nightdress is also bloodstained. Ginty's eyes reach his face. Travers lies, eyes open, mouth open, teeth slightly red-stained, neither peaceful nor distressed. Just nothing.
GINTY: I dropped the pears. She perches on the edge of the bed and takes his hand.
PAMELA: Hello house.
PAMELA: Oh dear god! Standing on the doorstep is Walt Disney. Pamela is, quite literally, speechless.
WALT: It was one heck of a job getting a seat on the very next flight, let me tell you.
PAMELA: But, you always get what you want eventually. Isn't that right He looks down at her hand clenched into a fist and shaking.
WALT: How about you show me how to make one of those nice English pots of INT. PAMELA'S DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT Pamela sits at the table, as Disney carries in a tray with a teapot, a milk jug, a sugar bowl and two cups. These he places on the table and proceeds to pour tea.
PAMELA: Milk. The milk goes in first. He attends to it.
WALT: I remember.
PAMELA: And whiskey. I'll have whiskey in Disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter. She takes it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup.
WALT: ( SURPRISED ) ( BEAT )
PAMELA: You've come to change my mind. To beat me into submission.
WALT: No, I've come because you misjudge How do I misjudge you?
PAMELA: How do I misjudge you?
WALT: You look at me and you see some kind of Hollywood King Midas.
PAMELA: And don't you?
WALT: If that was all it was would I have pursued an cranky, stubborn dame like you for twenty years? I'd've have saved myself an ulcer!
PAMELA: Mary Poppins isn't real.
WALT: Oh, no, that's not true. She's real as can be to my daughter's and to thousands of other children adults too. She's been there as a nighttime comfort to a heck of a lot of people.
PAMELA: Well, Where is she when I need her? Hm? I open the door to Mary Poppins and who should be standing there but Walt Disney! He laughs.
WALT: Mrs Travers, I am so sorry. I hoped this would be a magical experience for you, for all of us. But I let you down and in doing so, I've broken a twenty year old promise to my girls.
PAMELA: Ah! Not true then that Disney created man in his own image?
WALT: But it is true that you created yourself in someone else's yes? She doesn't answer. Walt takes mouthful of laced tea and coughs a little.
PAMELA: Can't say I do and as I have no plans to ever set foot on American soil again I'm afraid I never will.
WALT: It's mighty cold there in the winters. Bitter. Walt stops talking, catches himself, looks away and then gives in. His enthusiasm completely disappears and he's suddenly as ragged and as weary as Pamela.
PAMELA: I don't know what you think you know about me Walter
WALT: You must've loved and admired him a lot to take his name
PAMELA: Mrs. Travers. It's all about him isn't it? All of this. Everything. Pamela looks at her hands, they're shaking.
I: Mrs. Travers. It's all about him isn't it? All of this. Everything. Pamela looks at her hands, they're shaking.
WALT: Mrs. Travers. It's all about him isn't it? All of this. Everything. Pamela looks at her hands, they're shaking.
PAMELA: I don't need to forgive my father. He was a wonderful man.
WALT: No, you need to forgive Helen Goff. Life is a harsh sentence to lay down for yourself. Pamela looks down at the table top.
PAMELA: EXT. ANIMATION BUILDING - THREE YEARS LATER - DAY Disney employees pass by a giant movie poster which reads: MARY POPPINS - OPENING SOON! Walt exits the building. He's but a few steps out of the door when Tommie appears behind She hands him a sheet of paper.
TOMMIE: She hands him a sheet of paper.
WALT: Is that everyone?
TOMMIE: Not everyone. She looks at Walt questioningly.
WALT: ( SIGHS )
TOMMIE: Walt walks away, he's lost a bit of steam. Tommy watches him INT. PAMELA'S OFFICE - DAY. Pamela taps away on her typewriter with gusto. She pings the return and breathes, satisfied.
OMITTED: INT. PAMELA'S OFFICE - DAY. Pamela taps away on her typewriter with gusto. She pings the return and breathes, satisfied.
PAMELA: I should say so too. The doorbell sounds, voices. Pamela begins to tap again.
PAMELA: For goodness sake! She rises from her chair, smoothes down her skirt and makes her way to the front door.
DIARMUID: I am so pleased to hear that Mrs I should think you'll have a draft very soon.
PAMELA: I should think you'll have a draft very soon.
POLLY: You're perfectly capable of doing it yourself. Polly leaves, Pamela rolls her eyes.
PAMELA: She's quite the worst maid I've ever had!
DIARMUID: So why do you keep her?
PAMELA: I don't know she reminds me of Diarmuid laughs.
DIARMUID: Do you have a title?
PAMELA: Mary Poppins in the Kitchen.
DIARMUID: Wonderful. Should we start talking about the film rights? Pamela narrows her eyes at him.
PAMELA: NEVER again.
DIARMUID: ( BEAT )
PAMELA: Oh, I'm not going.
DIARMUID: Why not?
PAMELA: Hollywood premieres are not for old trout like me. Anyway, it's not
CONVENIENT: He hasn't invited you, has he? Pamela doesn't reply.
DIARMUID: He hasn't invited you, has he? Pamela doesn't reply.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Can I help you?
PAMELA: I'm perfectly capable thank you. The flight attendant recognizes her with something akin to Suit yourself ma'am.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Suit yourself ma'am.
PAMELA: ( CHEERY )
WALT: Morning Dolly. Dolly opens her mouth to speak but he's already past and
APPROACHING: TOMMIE'S DESK
TOMMIE'S DESK: Tommie sits, arms crossed and stares, half bemused at Walt.
PAMELA: Me again!
WALT: Mrs Travers! How wonderful to see you. What brings you to
PAMELA: I'm here for my premiere.
WALT: I didn't receive my invitation, but I just assumed the American postal service had fallen down on the job as per usual. She smiles sweetly.
PAMELA: I didn't receive my invitation, but I just assumed the American postal service had fallen down on the job as per usual. She smiles sweetly.
WALT: I'll have a uh, replacement sent to your hotel right away.
PAMELA: That's very kind, Mr Disney. I knew you wouldn't have forgotten me.
WALT: Pam, how could I?
PAMELA: How indeed? You did, after all, assure me that I wouldn't be INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY The porter lets Pamela into her room, and doesn't even bother hovering for a tip. Pamela turns and it's like deju vu - the flowers, the chocolates, the champagne, a VIP invitation to the premiere of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins. And, of course, the ubiquitous stuffed Mickey Mouse.
PAMELA: ( TO MICKEY )
PAMELA: ( TO DOORMAN )
DOORMAN: The doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo pulls up to the kerb. Pamela doesn't dare get her hopes up but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person in America.
RALPH: Had a feeling a certain friend of mine might be needing me tonight.
PAMELA: She rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug.
RALPH: You look like a million bucks! Let's get you to the ball. He opens the back door for her and she climbs in.
RALPH: ( in her ear ) This is your night. None of this would be possible without you. She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: "Who is that?" "Is that anyone?" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead. Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows he and Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.
BERT: You know, begging your pardon, but the one my heart goes out to is your father. The carousel horses at the Allora fair
JANE: Father in a cage? Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father's hand
BERT: They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know. The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed
MICHEAL: You won't ever leave us will you?
JANE: Whatever would we do without you?
MARY POPPINS: I shall stay until the wind And then an image from the film: George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined London street, on his way to be fired from the bank. Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction. Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud but people are noticing, looking at her. Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. She reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.
WALT: It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's alright. Mr Banks is going to be all right. I promise. Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. It's all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis.
PAMELA: No, no. It's just that I can't, I can't abide cartoons! We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the film: Let's Go Fly A Kite. The audience around her are smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to mouth along with the lyrics. And in her head one final image appears. Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window, sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken understanding of what is to come, before his close with TRAVERS ( V.O. ) Never. I promise. I will never lose EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY The shadow of an umbrella leaves the ten-year-old Ginty sitting in the lush grass, arms wrapped tightly around her chest, face to the sky as a smile breaks free across her TRAVERS ( V.O. ) Winds in the East Mist coming in The shadow of an umbrella, floats higher and higher
