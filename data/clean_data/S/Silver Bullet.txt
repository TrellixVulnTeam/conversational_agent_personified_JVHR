ARNIE: Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze! He takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes a churchkey from one of the front ones. He pops the cap and drinks deeply. He burps. Then he screws the half-empty bottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over. Then he picks up his crowbar.
ARNIE: Hot damn! Now. a little oil. He turns back toward the rail-rider.
ARNIE: It's not bitter, not sweet. it's a big fuckin' treat. A NOISE - bushes rattling; cinders clinking and rattling. ARNIE looks around.
ARNIE: Oh n- A huge clawed hand/paw comes sweeping down. ARNIE's head is granted an immediate Reno-style divorce from the rest of his EXT. THE RAIL-RIDER NIGHT SOUND of the beast approaching. A hairy arm and taloned hand reaches into the toolbox bolted to the back and rummages. The hand is dripping blood. It comes up with a bottle of Rheingold. The WEREWOLF begins to sing. It is a bizarre funny-horrible grunting, the words hellishly recognizable. My beer is Rheingold the dry beer. No bottle opener for this thing; it brings the neck of the bottle down sharply on the edge of the toolbox. Beer foams EXT. THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, IN DEEP SHADOW NIGHT He/It rams the jagged neck of the bottle deep into its mouth and drinks. Foam drizzles down its pelt. It's grinning. Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer.
JANE: I'm going out for a while, 'kay?
NAN: All right. Stay close. And make sure your brother's all right. As JANE gets up, the applause starts to fade a bit. NOTE: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continue to wear it through the whole movie.
LOWE: For the last ten years. No amplification. He taps the mike.
LOWE: For the last ten years, I have had a dream. A dream of a time when modern medical care would come to this small community, which sometimes seems so far from Durham, with her lifesaving hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at which I see so many of my friends gathered, will be the start of making my dream come true. SOUND: Enthusiastic applause.
MARTY: Lemme hold him! BRADY hands it over. As MARTY looks at the snake, BRADY EXT. JANE, COMING OUT OF THE TENT DAY I was almost fifteen that summer. My brother Marty was eleven. Marty and his friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I had to bear. Brady was actually the worse of the two, but I was rarely disposed to see that. Not when my younger brother was so constantly thrown in my face by my $32,000 is a lot of money. But when you think of the lives this unit might save, it seems very inexpensive indeed. Applause greets this.
BRADY: I got an idea.
MARTY: BRADY looks toward JANE. MARTY follows his gaze. His eyes BRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin.
MARTY: You wouldn't. BRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin.
MARTY: You would.
LOWE: An endeavor like this seems to me to be the very definition of community - all of us pulling together as one, farmers and merchants. Protestants and Catholics.
MARTY: It was just a blacksnake, Jane-
JANE: Look at my knees! Look at my dress! I hate you!
BRADY: Did wittle Janie make wee-wee in her EXT. MARTY Stop it, Brady.
MARTY: Stop it, Brady.
BRADY: Ooooh, naughty!
MARTY: Jane, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. We didn't mean- He's reached her. JANE is sobbing now, hysterical.
JANE: Oh, no! You never mean to! I hate you, you booger! She runs away.
MARTY: Oh, shut up, Brady. You're warped.
JANE: Stella? Is that you?
JANE: Who's going away? STELLA turns to her, weeping still and distracted.
STELLA: What am I going to tell my mother? If he won't marry me, what am I going to tell my mother? Stella, I don't know what-
STELLA: Oh, leave me alone! Just leave me alone, you stupid thing! STELLA lumbers across the bandstand and down the steps. JANE stares after her, bewildered and perhaps even a little INT. THE PODIUM, WITH REV. O'BANION Let us pray.
O'BANION: Let us pray.
O'BANION: May the Grace of God shine upon those gathered here. and lift them up. and grant success to the endeavor to which they have so openheartedly declared their support. Amen.
NAN: I want you two to bury the hatchet. You're being very silly, Jane. Did you see my knees?
MARTY: Jane, I-
NAN: I think you're being mean as well as silly. Your brother has never had a scraped knee in his whole life. Well, here it is - the chief source of JANE'S animus against her brother and the source of most of the tension in the COSLAW family. MARTY winces and turns away a little, embarrassed - this always happens. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how to make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it.
JANE: You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
MARTY: Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
JANE: Brady's a booger and so are you!
NAN: Jane Coslaw! Stop it or I'll throw the whole bunch of you out! In this traditional family unit, BOB is the Voice of Authority. They all heed, although the atmosphere remains INT. THE STATION WAGON DAY Train tracks run near the road.
BOB: They had to pick up what was left of him in a peach basket.
JANE: Oh, Daddy! Gross!
MARTY: Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
JANE: If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it. You're not going to vomit, Jane. And I think we've all had quite enough of this horror-movie talk.
MARTY: Can I come in?
JANE: What's the money for?
MARTY: A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
JANE: I don't want your money. You're a booger.
MARTY: It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up. She looks at him and sees he's sincere - honestly contrite. She softens. There's hope for these two kids yet, maybe.
JANE: I can get a pair of L'Eggs down at the pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine. Here. She pushes the rest back to him, then looks at the can. She picks it up, curious.
MARTY: That's for you, too. Uncle Al gave it to me- That drunk!
MARTY: -but I want you to have it. He gives her a warm, melting smile. When your little brother is being good to you it's time to watch out - but JANE has been lulled. She starts to open it, then looks questioningly at him.
MARTY: Yeah, go ahead. She opens it. A long paper snake - the kind with a spring inside it - leaps out. She shrieks.
JANE: You booger! MARTY backs up the wheelchair so he's out of her reach. It really is for your birthday, though - try it on Brady. He'll wet his pants.
JANE: Go to hell!
STELLA: Suicides go to hell. Especially if they're pregnant. And I don't even care. She takes another five pills. And another five. SOUNDS: Rattling foliage.
MOTHER: Oh my dear God. Stella! She runs for the doorway and the hall. From upstairs comes a confusion of SOUNDS: roars, breaking furniture, shattering INT. STELLA'S BED, CU One of those deadly claw-hands sweeps down the bed, ripping through the sheets. the mattress. the spring itself. Hairy, muddy feet with protruding talons leap onto it.
MOTHER: She reaches the closed door of STELLA's room, vacillates there for a moment. and then pushes it open and goes in. A long beat of silence as we hold on the door.
PETE: What'd they say, Joe?
HALLER: They said they'd be here by noon. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea telling that Smokey Bear from the Detective Division to fuck off, Joe. I waited until he hung up. Jesus, what a mess. I wish I'd stayed in the army. Let's go on out there. He gets slowly up.
STURMFULLER: BRADY and TAMMY are riding bikes. Now there is the SOUND of a gasoline engine, and MARTY catches up. He's got the Silver Bullet's motor running for the first time in the movie. Later on it will sound extremely powerful, like a racing car, but now it just sounds like a big lawnmower engine with a muffler on it. It's pretty cool, though - a bright metallic silver with flame decals on the motor housing. Looks sort of like something Big Daddy Roth might have thought up. On the back is a license plate which says SILVER
BRADY: Look out! Look out! It's Madman Marty and the Silver Bullet! TAMMY laughs.
BRADY: You glad to be back in jail, Marty?
MARTY: Sure - I like school.
TAMMY: You booger.
MARTY: That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
BRADY: I gotta split - see ya, Marty. Tammy.
MARTY: Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
TAMMY: What's that?
MARTY: Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine. but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
TAMMY: For getting a divorce?
MARTY: Well. it is his third.
TAMMY: The other kids are gone; they are alone. The sidewalk has ended and they roll slowly along the dirt verge of the road. They look toward:
TAMMY: Thanks for coming with me, Marty- I was scared to go past her house by myself. Yeah. it is a little scary.
TAMMY: I mean, I saw her. All the time. TAMMY stops her bike. She's on the verge of tears.
TAMMY: I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but.
MARTY: Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel. He gets the Silver Bullet moving again, and she has to pedal along to catch up.
TAMMY: There's something else scary.
MARTY: TAMMY ( points ) EXT. OLD GREENHOUSE, MARTY AND TAMMY'S POV It stands a bit behind the house itself. A creepy place. Many of the glass panes are broken; some of these - not many - have been blocked with cardboard. The inside is a jungle of plants that have run to riot. In the f.g. is a mucky-looking garden patch where nothing much is growing.
TAMMY: I've been hearing noises in there.
MARTY: What kind of noises?
TAMMY: Rattling. Rustling.
MARTY: And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
TAMMY: And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
MILT: Tammy, you get on in here and do some EXT. THE GREENHOUSE I've got to go.
MARTY: I'd go out and take a look myself, but I think the Bullet'd get stuck in the garden. It looks sorta greasy. She smiles at him, bends over, and kisses him on the mouth. MARTY is stunned. but happy.
TAMMY: You would, wouldn't you? Sure. No sweat.
TAMMY: Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since. you know.
MARTY: Yeah. but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
TAMMY: Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, EXT. THE WHEELCHAIR "DASHBOARD," MARTY'S POV There's a gas gauge here, and the needle is almost on "E."
MARTY: I'm always doing this! I gotta go, Tammy.
TAMMY!: TAMMY ( calls ) Coming Daddy! ( To MARTY ) Bye. thanks again for coming home with me. She waves and goes biking down the driveway as MARTY motors back onto the street and turns toward town.
MILT: 'Bout time. Why you want to hang around that cripple?
TAMMY: I like him.
MILT: Goddamn cripples always end up on welfare. Ought to electrocute all of 'em. Balance the fucking budget. Having delivered this pearl of wisdom, MILT goes inside, now scratching his ass. TAMMY pauses a moment and looks toward THE CAMERA, her face troubled and scared.
VIRGIL: Well, Marty! I see you lucked out again!
MARTY: Yep. Would you fill it up, please, Mr. Cutts?
VIRGIL: Want me to check the oil?
MARTY: Wipe the windshield an check the driver's bullshit level? MARTY laughs; VIRGIL starts carefully pumping gas into the Silver Bullet's small tank.
VIRGIL: Wipe the windshield an check the driver's bullshit level? MARTY laughs; VIRGIL starts carefully pumping gas into the Silver Bullet's small tank.
MARTY: Okay, okay. I call. He tosses in three baseball cards.
UNCLE AL: Wait a minute, wait a minute! He grabs one of MARTY'S cards, looks at it, and tosses it Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
UNCLE AL: Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
MARTY: Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
UNCLE AL: Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox. He swallows whiskey and chases it with beer.
NAN: Come on, Marty- bedtime. She starts to wheel him away.
MARTY: UNCLE AL Let the boy finish the game, Nan. He means it, drunk or not. She reluctantly rolls MARTY back to the table.
UNCLE AL: Let the boy finish the game, Nan. He means it, drunk or not. She reluctantly rolls MARTY back to the table.
NAN: Make it quick. UNCLE AL lays down his hand.
UNCLE AL: Three kings. I got a straight to the queen!
UNCLE AL: Bullshit luck! That's enough! Aww, Mom-!
NAN: I don't want you drinking around Marty. That's too much. If you can't stop it, you better stay away. AL straightens up. There is a sort of command force in this man, and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal drunkenness so we can see it.
UNCLE AL: I come here because Marty needs a friend.
NAN: Yes. you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away. She leaves the room, almost crying. UNCLE AL looks after her, and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering ashtray. He pours beer over the mess, putting out the fire but creating something that looks even worse. He begins drunkenly picking up again. Another wonderful time at Sister Nan's house! Heeyyy!
MARTY: Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
JANE: What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
MARTY: Stop it! He lunges at her, but JANE steps back easily. MARTY overbalances and falls out of the wheelchair. His toothbrush clatters across the tile. Hey! That you, Marty?
JANE: He's okay, Dad! She looks around swiftly, then bends down.
MARTY: Yes. Go away.
JANE: Let me help you up. SOUND of her climbing the stairs. JANE throws a quick look back over her shoulder and then helps MARTY up in his chair. He helps by pulling on the sink counter. JANE has time to give MARTY one quick look- "Please don't tell on me," it says. NAN comes in.
NAN: Jane, have you been teasing your brother again?
MARTY: She wasn't, Mom- I dropped my toothbrush and fell over when I tried to get it. Jane helped pick me up. He bats his eyes at her. Jane's wunnnderful. JANE picks up his toothbrush. Here. Brush them good, Marty. Some of that shit in your head might leak down into your mouth and poison you.
NAN: Jane Coslaw! But JANE stalks off. MARTY is grinning. It was a good EXT. THE STURMFULLER HOUSE NIGHT We can see the moon in the sky beyond the ruined greenhouse. THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD the greenhouse. We begin to pick up SOUNDS: RATTLING.RUSTLING.and low animal GRUNTS.
MILT: Let's see if you want to come back and break my pots all to shit after I put some rock salt in your asses!
MRS. STURMFULLER: Tammy, where's your father? SOUND: Another SCREAM from the greenhouse.
VIRGIL: But the woman's bed was ripped right down the middle, Elmer- it's take a chainsaw to do something like that!
PORTER: Damn straight!
ELMER: Shut up, Porter. ( To VIRGIL ) What about the ANDY FAIRTON has joined the group. He sits down uninvited.
VIRGIL: That could be something to throw off the cops. And it ain't animals that try to confues the law; it's people do that.
ANDY FAIRTON: Law around here don't need much confusing. PETE looks around at this. Being the deputy constable and ineffectual by nature, he's pretty sensitive. Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass if someone rammed it full of radium and gave him a Geiger counter. Could be I know a fella who's still PO'd over getting fined two hundred bucks for that little fender bender out on the Ridge Road last year.
ANDY: Could be I know a fat old fella who ought to take care of his mouth before someone comes along and turns it inside out. I pay Joe Haller's salary to keep the people in this town safe, and he ain't doing it. INT. BILLY McCLAREN, AT THE BAR He's looking toward the table where the Fairton group sits. Last town report said you was in arrears your taxes, Andy. Guess you must have paid up, huh?
ANDY: What are you, trying to be smart? OWEN KNOPFLER comes over.
OWEN: You guys turn down the thermostat or I'm gonna turn you all out. Now who's drinking? Bring me a Schlitz.
BRADY: Drop it! As the kite flutters down, JANE comes biking up.
JANE: Marty Coslaw, you get down out of that tree!
MARTY: Push the Bullet over, Jane, okay?
JANE: They both are. At me, for not getting you sooner. I ought to let you fall. But she pushes the chair over and MARTY drops into it. He pushes the starter and the Silver Bullet fires up.
JANE: Come on, Marty. She starts biking away. MARTY starts after her, pauses, and looks at:
OWEN: Jesus wept. He reaches under the bar and comes out with a baseball bat. Burned into the side of the bat, so it reads vertically toward the handle, is the word "peacemaker." OWEN hurries around the bar with it.
PETE: You heard what I said, motormouth. ANDY gets up, infuriated. There's apparently going to be a brawl. Behind them, HERB KINCAID has approached the table. HERB hasn't even noticed what's going on; he's got problems of his own.
HERB: He breaks for the door. ANDY FAIRTON grabs him.
HERB: Get out of my way! He pushes ANDY aside. HERB is out the door, chased by PETE and several of the others.
HALLER: Stay off the bandstand, Herb.
HERB: Is it my boy? Is it Brady?
HALLER: Don't go up- Brady! Brady! Disappears into the dark. HALLER looks down at his lap.
HERB: Br-( CUTS OFF ) The other men arrive, PETE in the lead. HALLER doesn't look Joe, is it- Is it the Kicaid b- Shhh, I said. The men look uneasily at HALLER, at each other. ANDY FAIRTON shoves forward.
PETE: Joe, is it- Is it the Kicaid b- Shhh, I said. The men look uneasily at HALLER, at each other. ANDY FAIRTON shoves forward.
PETE: Is it the Kicaid b- Shhh, I said. The men look uneasily at HALLER, at each other. ANDY FAIRTON shoves forward.
ANDY: What the fuck is going on h- SOUND: HERB SCREAMS. A pause. HERB screams again. The men flinch back. HALLER doesn't look up. Now, from the darkness on the bandstand, HERB begins to LAUGH. The men shrink back further, looking more uneasy than ever. We'll bury his shoes. Now HALLER gets up and joins the other men. That's what we'll have to do; we'll bury his shoes. Maybe in a couple of Roi-Tan cigar boxes.
HERB: We'll bury his shoes because his feet are still in them and they're the only part of him that makes sense anymore. HERB laughs harder.
HERB: It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this town ever saw!
LOWE: Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon. There will be a requiem mass for Brady Kincaid this Sunday. They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you, if I could. He looks out at them.
LOWE: If there is any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time of the beast always passes. He is struggling with this, trying dreadfully hard.
LOWE: If there are times when we feel alone and afraid, only small creatures in the dark, then these are the times when we must turn to one another for our comfort and our hope. To our neighbors. To our community. To our love for each other. I alone cannot ease the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if I believe anything it's this: we can comfort each other. We can heal each other. We can go on together.
LOWE: The Bible tells us not to fear the terror that creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday, and yet we do. we do. Because there is much we don't know, and we feel very small. But we must not be alone. We must not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes known. ( Pause ) The time of the beast always passes. ( Pause ) Let us pray.
UNCLE AL: You all right, Marty?
MARTY: UNCLE AL There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
UNCLE AL: There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
MARTY: UNCLE AL Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
UNCLE AL: Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
MARTY: Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
UNCLE AL: What if it's some kind of monster? Jesus, Marty! Come off it!
MARTY: What if it's some kind of monster? Jesus, Marty! Come off it!
MARTY: What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
UNCLE AL: A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood. Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
MARTY: Tammy said she'd been hearing noises in that greenhouse. Growling noises, like a big animal. Her father was killed that night. UNCLE AL looks at him doubtfully for a moment, as if almost believing. Then he shakes his head.
UNCLE AL: Marty, you have to get this idea out of your head. Psychotics are more active when the moon is full, and this guy is a psycho. He's going to turn out to be as human as you or me. ( Pause ) In a manner of speaking. Now let's get you inside. He opens his door and gets out.
ANDY FAIRTON: Okay, you all know what group you're in and what area you'll be covering, right?
PORTER ZINNEMAN: Damn straight!
ELMER ZINNEMAN: Shut up, Porter. The men are all dressed in hunting clothes- red-and-black-checked shirts, orange caps, etc. They all have guns. Among their number are a few women as well, looking tough and determined. We see almost everyone we've met up to this point. LOWE is there, looking deeply ANDY FAIRTON is standing on the bar. These are his vigilantes; he has organized them. ANDY radiates male macho football-coach confidence. He's mesmerized the crowd: they really believe they are going to go out and Shoot One for the Gipper.
ANDY: Groups one through four are in the woods north of the Sturmfuller place. Five and six west of Carson Creek. The door at the back opens; HALLER and PETE come in. JOE HALLER is in extremely bad shape. He hasn't come back much from the murder of BRADY. I believe he is having some sort of spiritual crisis, and while it is not our purpose to explore what it might be- this is, after all, a horror movie and not a John Cassavetes film- we can see that it has seriously weakened his authority. Moonrise at 8:52 p.m. Some nervous laughter greets this. Meanwhile, HALLER and PETE are working their way to the front, where they end up next to a grim-faced HERB KINCAID. If he comes out to stroll in the moonlight tonight, we're going to get the sorry sucker.
ELMER: Shut up, Porter.
ANDY: Just remember, it's the psycho we want, not each other. So look before you-
HALLER: I want all of you folks to go home! A disgruntled murmur meets this. HALLER moves forward a bit, and turns to face them.
HALLER: I can't remember deputizing a single one of you!
ANDY: That's right, Joe- the only deputy you got is that fat shitbag beside you, and neither one of you has done a damn thing about solving this case. There is a mutter of agreement.
ANDY: You couldn't catch a cold. HALLER looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at the crowd. They look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces we see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination. HALLER speaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation.
HALLER: The law has a name for what you men are planning. It's private justice, and private justice is about a step and a half away from lynch mobs and hang ropes. I'm no J. Edgar Hoover, but I am the law in Tarker's Mills, and I want you men to go home. They shuffle their feet uneasily; many look down. He is getting to them.
ANDY: Don't let this guy scare you! What's he done since this thing started but hang his face out? It's not working. Many of the men look disgusted with both ANDY and themselves. He ain't got so much as a fingerprint!
OWEN KNOPFLER: Ah, shut up, Andy.
ANDY: Don't tell me to- HERB KINCAID steps forward.
HERB: Yes. Correct. Shut up. ANDY, surprised and bewildered, does. HERB turns and looks grimly at JOE HALLER, who can barely meet his gaze. I just came from my boy's funeral.
HALLER: Herb.I know how upset- how grief-stricken you must be.but- He was torn apart. Utter silence in OWEN'S place now. The others are staring, Yes. Yes, but- Upset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say. Constable, you don't know what those words mean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces! HERB turns to the others in the pub. Tears stream down his My son was torn to pieces! You come in here and talk to these men about private justice. You dare to do that. Constable Haller, why don't you go out to Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady and explain to him about private justice. Would you want to do that? HALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet.
HALLER: Yes. Yes, but- Upset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say. Constable, you don't know what those words mean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces! HERB turns to the others in the pub. Tears stream down his My son was torn to pieces! You come in here and talk to these men about private justice. You dare to do that. Constable Haller, why don't you go out to Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady and explain to him about private justice. Would you want to do that? HALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet.
HERB: My son was torn to pieces! You come in here and talk to these men about private justice. You dare to do that. Constable Haller, why don't you go out to Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady and explain to him about private justice. Would you want to do that? HALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet.
HERB: No. I thought not. You folks stay here if you want. I wouldn't ask anyone to do anything that runs counter to his conscience. As for me. I'm going out and hunt up a little private justice. ANDY FAIRTON has swelled up again. He grins poisonously at the slumped HALLER. He pushes off after HERB KINCAID. Other men start to follow.
LOWE: Billy. Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can. Joe's had his chance, Father. Leave me be. He pushes outside. LOWE looks around wildly; his face says he can't believe this is happening. He grabs PORTER ZINNEMAN, then, as PORTER shoves by him, at a couple of others with mounting desperation. HALLER makes his way to LOWE through the thinning crowd and draws him aside.
HALLER: Let them go.
LOWE: This is that spirit of community you were talking about. Grand, ain't it? Maybe they'll shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can mount the head and raffle it off. To benefit the Medcu van, of course. HALLER laughs.
HALLER: This is that spirit of community you were talking about. Grand, ain't it? Maybe they'll shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can mount the head and raffle it off. To benefit the Medcu van, of course. HALLER laughs.
LOWE: But can't we do anything? OWEN KNOPFLER hurries past them; he has a rifle over one shoulder in a sling. In his left hand he carries the peacemaker bat.
HALLER: Sure. We can pray to Christ that none of them get killed.
ANDY: Well, it's about frigging time! They'll have his hide tacked to somebody's barn door before we get out there! They pile into the car, ANDY behind the wheel. He throws it into gear and backs out onto Main Street.
ELMER: Help me Porter, goddammit! PORTER grabs ELMER'S right arm and pulls. There's a RIPPING SOUND. ELMER screams.
ELMER: Don't pull me! You want to rip the right cheek of my ass right off?
PORTER: Well, Elmer, there are folks that'd say you've been half-assed most of your-
ELMER: Are you going to unhook me or be a wise guy? PORTER begins to pick the barbed wire out of ELMER'S pants.
NIGHT: O'BANION looks rather amusing in his hunting gear- like that priest from "The Exorcist" on safari.
VIRGIL: Jesus, that was close. Uh, pardon me, Rev'runt.
O'BANION: Come on. Be careful. They move slowly ahead, O'BANION still a bit in the lead. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as the reverend pushes into some knee-high brush. SOUND: A RUSTY METALLIC CLANG, followed by a FLESHY CHOMP. O'BANION begins to scream and struggle.
VIRGIL: Rev'runt! What is it? My foot! My foot! VIRGIL lunges to him and looks down.
BOBBY ROBERTSON: As far as I could tell, it could have come from anywhere.
ANDY: We'll spread out in a skirmish line. If the bastard tries to go around us, we'll hear him.
BOBBY: I dunno-
MAGGIE: I think Bobby Robertson here's making lemonade in his pants. That lemonade got ice cubes in it, Bobby? ANDY FAIRTON and EDGAR ROUNDS laugh. ASPINALL and BILLY McCLAREN smile a little. Let off him, Maggie. I'm scared, too. I ain't scared! Let's go!
ANDY: Okay. Spread out on me. Five feet apart.
BOBBY: No- it's behind us. I told you you couldn't It isn't on either side.
ASPINALL: It isn't on either side.
ANDY: What are you- ASPINALL is looking around, his eyes widening with fear.
ASPINALL: It's under the fog. It's right in with us. The GROWLING STOPS. There's a beat of silence. Then: SOUND: SNARLING.AND A RIPPING CHOMP as dinner is served.
OWEN: Come on, then! You want to rock and roll with me?
WEREWOLF: "REEEEEL SLOW!" EXT. MAGGIE AND ANDY Look at it! Holy God, Andy, look at that thing! I don't want to look at it. He runs, while MAGGIE stares, mesmerized, at:
"REEEEEL SLOW!": EXT. MAGGIE AND ANDY He runs, while MAGGIE stares, mesmerized, at:
OWEN: Come on, come on! You want to do the bop? I'll bop you, motherfucker! Come on! The WEREWOLF dives under the ground mist. Uncertain, OWEN begins to back up, holding the bat in his hands. OWEN is jerked down into the mist. He SCREAMS. The peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down. Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars in pain. CHOMPING SOUND. OWEN Come on, you bastard! The peacemaker rises out of the mist again. The hands holding it are bloody. Blood runs down the bat. It descends. Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars again. There is a GURGLING SCREAM from OWEN. and then a curious SPLINTERING SOUND as the WEREWOLF sinks its fangs into the bat.
LOWE: Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon. They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you if I could.
HERB: There is no comfort, Father. Only private INT. LOWE, AT THE PULPIT He's thrown off his stride. Beginning to sweat. He's like an actor trying to remember his lines.
LOWE: Uh, if there's any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time- He looks down. His eyes widen in fear.
LOWE: The time. the time of the beast always passes. There are answers. ways. ways to. to cope. if we turn to each other. LOWE looks toward:
CONGREGATION: Sowing in the morning/sowing seeds of kindness/sowing in the noontide/and the dewy eve. We pan their faces, stopping on JOE HALLER. Now something is happening to JOE'S face. It is bulging, changing. He looks up from his hymnal and his eyes glare green. The pupils are split. He grins, showing big teeth. They are all changing. Among the things we see are: PETE SYLVESTER, who is a church deacon, rushing down the aisle, changing, snarling. He grabs ANDY FAIRTON and the two of them grapple in the aisle. A YOUNG WOMAN with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket covering the baby's face and we see it's a wolfling; already the YOUNG WOMAN'S own hands are turning into claws. TAMMY STURMFULLER changing; PELTZER the druggist changing; the ZINNEMAN BROTHERS changing. At the organ, MRS. BOWIE is now a werewolf clad in tatters of a silk bombazine dress; she/it is still wearing a veiled hat on her head, and she is beating the shit out of the organ keys with her clawed hands. She sounds like Jerry Lee Lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies. And now the tune changes from the remnants of "Bringing In The Sheaves." It changes into the Rheingold jingle. My beer is Rheingold the dry beer. Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer.
REV. LOWE: No! No! No!
PETE: Yeah. but what are they doing?
HALLER: Putting on my Sherlock Holmes deerstalker cap, I deduce that they are leaving.
HALLER: She's not the only one. Lot of people leaving town. And I guess if we want a beer, we'll have to drink it at home. He nods toward:
PETE: Joe, what's wrong with you? I ain't never seen you like this. I lost my guts. It was the Kincaid boy. I looked at him. and I felt it happen. It was no big deal. No worse than pissing down your own leg. You ever do that? Maybe when you were real scared? PETE, distressed, does not respond.
HALLER: It was the Kincaid boy. I looked at him. and I felt it happen. It was no big deal. No worse than pissing down your own leg. You ever do that? Maybe when you were real scared? PETE, distressed, does not respond.
HALLER: One minute I had me some guts- as much as the next man, anyhow- and then, poof. Gone. PETE'S looking at him in a kind of terror.
PETE: Joe. you are going to feel better than this. This. this feeling of yours. it's gonna pass.
JOE: Is it? He walks away, back toward the Municipal Building ( the sign out front reminds folks to SUPPORT THE MEDCU VAN! ) while PETE looks after him, very deeply troubled.
NAN COSLAW: Stop it, Jane.
JANE: Well, I don't see why everybody just about breaks down and cries whenever he-
BOB: Stop it, your mother said. They've just paused for a quick look at the sign; now BOB pulls out onto the road again and heads toward home.
MARTY: It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
UNCLE AL: And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty. MARTY hands him a medium-sized carton with the words "Speed Shop" printed on it.
MARTY: Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a. a.
UNCLE AL: It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
MARTY: Well. I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL: I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
MARTY: Don't call me dear boy.
UNCLE AL: But you are, you know- you are my dear boy. He gives MARTY a kiss and smiles at him. MARTY smiles back.
UNCLE AL: Look at this. He pulls out a brand-new carburetor- it's a chrome-plated This is gonna turn your wheelchair into a fucking F-14, Marty- He looks around quickly, guiltily.
UNCLE AL: Your mom's not around, is she?
MARTY: She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
UNCLE AL: Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that MARTY does. UNCLE AL slides the carb onto the gasket and starts attaching bolts.
UNCLE AL: The guy killed your best friend, drove your girl out of town, and stole the second-best holiday in the year. Have I got it right? You got it right, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL: Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that. but I got something that just might cheer you up.
MARTY: UNCLE AL Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
UNCLE AL: Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
UNCLE AL: All is cool, Marty-boy. Go for it. MARTY pushes the starter. The engine starts at once, but the tone is entirely different. Before, MARTY'S wheelchair was a poppety-popping pussycat. Now the engine rumbles like a hood's street rod idling at a traffic light. MARTY looks startled. Gun it. MARTY guns it. The engine roars.
UNCLE AL: Jesus! Not too much! You got a pilot's license, Marty?
UNCLE AL: You got a pilot's license, Marty?
MARTY: Do I need one?
UNCLE AL: We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful. MARTY puts the Bullet in gear and pulls away.
VRROOM!: EXT. THE SILVER BULLET'S MOTOR, CU A lot of changes back here. It looks almost like a motorcyle engine now. That chromed-silver carb predominates.
UNCLE AL: You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
MARTY: It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL: It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
MARTY: I don't get you.
UNCLE AL: I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
MARTY: UNCLE AL EXT. THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON The last bit of daylight is just filtering away.
UNCLE AL: EXT. THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON The last bit of daylight is just filtering away.
UNCLE AL: I've got to go, Nan- I had a wonderful time. He kisses her cheek affectionately, and she smiles at him.
NAN: So have I, actually. I wish it could always be like this.
UNCLE AL: See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
MARTY: He and UNCLE AL go around to the driveway. NAN looks at them with troubled love.
UNCLE AL: Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
MARTY: Yeah! What is it? AL unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper shopping bag. He places the bag in MARTY'S lap. MARTY opens the bag, but it's really too dark to see inside. He reaches in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers, Roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc. An expression of sublime delight fills MARTY'S face as he inventories these goodies.
UNCLE AL: You're gonna have the Fourth of July in October, Marty. Just don't blow your head off. ( Pause ) And remember that it isn't just the fireworks. It's because no crazy shithead should be able to stop the good guys, if you can dig that. I can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al! Thank you!
UNCLE AL: Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
MARTY: Yeah, I know. It's great!
UNCLE AL: One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
MARTY: Yeah. sure.
UNCLE AL: Save this one for last. He brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end. A fat fuse sticks out behind the head.
MARTY: What is it?
UNCLE AL: A tracer. You'll like it.
MARTY: Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
UNCLE AL: You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now. MARTY motors over to the side of the garage, where there's a line of bushes, and conceals the bag in them. UNCLE AL gets in his car and starts it up. MARTY comes back. Have a good time, dear boy! And watch out for the werewolves! He leaves. MARTY sits in his wheelchair, waving.
MARTY: Is someone there?
MARTY: It's a werewolf! I saw it! Last night-
UNCLE AL: You dreamed it, Marty. No! I went out late last night- and-
UNCLE AL: There are no such things as werewolves. Please, dear boy, have some pity. He hangs up and falls back into bed. Obscene phone caller. Go back to sleep.
UNCLE AL: Obscene phone caller. Go back to sleep.
JANE: Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
MARTY: Where's Mom?
JANE: Went shopping. Why?
MARTY: Jane, I have to talk to you. About what? MARTY looks at her earnestly.
MARTY: I need you to help me. Uncle Al won't believe me, and if you won't help me, I.
MRS. THAYER: JANE ( politely ) I'm collecting returnable bottles and cans for the Medcu Drive, Missus Thayer- I just wondered if you had any. Her husband comes up the hall.
MR. THAYER: Who is it?
MRS. THAYER: Jane Coslaw.
JANE: Hi, Mr. Thayer.
MR. THAYER: Hello, Jane.
MRS. THAYER: Bring your cart around to the back, Jane- we'll look in the garage.
JANE: Thank you. She starts down the steps and we
JANE: I'm going to bring in a monster load of bottles in an hour or so! That's great, Jane. I'll be waiting.
BILLY: I know what you're after, Jane, and you're out of luck. Little Toby Whittislaw was in yesterday, and I gave 'em all to him.
JANE: Oh. okay. But her eyes have fixed on the towel over the face of the man in the other barber chair. She walks over to him.
JANE: That you, Mr. Fairton? No- it's Ronald McDonald. I came in for a shave and a burger. The men laugh. JANE smiles politely. And pulls the hot towel away from his eyes. His two eyes. Got any bottles, Mr. Fairton?
ANDY: JANE ( just as sweet ) Oh. okay. She puts the towel back and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as she returns to the door.
JANE: 'Bye, Mr. McClaren. 'Bye, Jane. JANE goes out.
JANE: Father Lowe! I'm ready to turn in my bottles and cans!
LOWE: Take your cart around to the garage and unload, Jane! Then bring me your tally sheet!
JANE: EXT. JANE, A WIDER SHOT She goes down the steps and starts to push the cart around the house.
JANE: Father Lowe? No answer. After a moment of interior debate, JANE enters the kitchen.
JANE: Father Lowe?. I've got my tally sheet. Farther into the hall. A hand drops onto her shoulder. Very good, Jane! She jumps, and so do we. She turns around and looks up at:
JANE: I. I don't feel so well, I guess maybe I got too much sun.
LOWE: Would you like to come in the parlor and lie down for a bit? Or have a cold drink? I have some soda-
JANE: No! ( softer ) That is, I have to get home and help my mom with lunch.
LOWE: I'll give you a ride! JANE is retreating down the hall toward the front door.
JANE: No- she. she was going to meet me at the market. I'll be fine.
LOWE: Give my best to your brother, Jane.
JANE: I will. She bolts.
JANE: I ran faster than I ever ran in my life- what do you think, dummox? By the time I got back here, I really thought I was going to faint. ( Pause ) What are we going to do, Marty? If we tried to tell anybody- grown-ups, I mean- they'd laugh. What are we going to do? I think I know.
UNCLE AL: Uncle Al- From him I'd expect it. I sometimes think his common sense got paralyzed along with his legs. But you, Jane! You! Little Polly Practical! You don't understand. Oh, I understand plenty! I understand that my niece and nephew are sending the local Catholic priest little love notes suggesting that he gargle with a broken light bulb or eat a rat-poison omelet!
JANE: Uncle Al- From him I'd expect it. I sometimes think his common sense got paralyzed along with his legs. But you, Jane! You! Little Polly Practical! You don't understand. Oh, I understand plenty! I understand that my niece and nephew are sending the local Catholic priest little love notes suggesting that he gargle with a broken light bulb or eat a rat-poison omelet!
MARTY: It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
UNCLE AL: I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
MARTY: Was it a prescription?
UNCLE AL: What the hell does that matter?
MARTY: It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
UNCLE AL: Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
MARTY: Well. was it a prescription?
UNCLE AL: I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
MARTY: What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
UNCLE AL: You want to know what I think?
MARTY: No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
UNCLE AL: Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or It was not! You want me to show you! Come on! I'm not afraid! I'll show you right now!
UNCLE AL: No thank you, Jane. I'm a little old for palying the Hardy Boys Meet the Catholic JANE stamps her foot, furious with UNCLE AL.
MARTY: Never mind, Jane. He'll have gotten rid of it by now anyway.
JANE: If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
UNCLE AL: I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
JANE: Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters? UNCLE AL stops. He hasn't thought of this. He looks toward:
MARTY: I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
UNCLE AL: Marty, do you see your suspect?
UNCLE AL: Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital. or dead.
MARTY: I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
UNCLE AL: When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
JANE: I don't know exactly what I believe. But I know that what I saw was a baseball bat and not a broomstick. I know there was something strange about the way the house smelled that day. It smelled like an animal's den. And I believe in Marty. I mean- there are times when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but I still believe in him. ( Pause ) You used to believe in him, too, Uncle Al. UNCLE AL looks momentarily ashamed of himself. Then he throws his hands up in disgust.
UNCLE AL: He walks ahead of them. MARTY bats his eyes sweetly at JANE. She walks on, miffed. MARTY gooses the Silver Bullet to catch up.
OUTFIELDER: You comin' down to Robertson's for a soda, Marty?
MARTY: No- I guess I'll go home. I think that here we are seeing a rare moment of depression in MARTY- they can run and play ball. He can't.
OUTFIELDER: Okay- seeya!
MARTY: Yeah. seeya. He fires up the Bullet and starts away alone.
LOWE: Oh, you bastard! He floors the engine.
JESUS!: As the chase goes on it becomes apparent that LOWE is gaining. MARTY looks increasingly desperate. And now he looks down at:
MARTY: Come on, baby. come on. His face registers hope as he sees:
PROHIBITED!: EXT. MARTY, IN THE BULLET He twists the throttle as far as it will turn- he's going for broke. The coupe chases him- and now the Silver Bullet's motor COUGHS.
LOWE: I'm very sorry about this. I don't know if you believe that or not, but it's true. I would never willingly hurt a child. You should have left me alone, Marty. SOUND of footfalls resumes.
LOWE: You're going to have a terrible accident, Marty. You're going to fall into the river. SOUND: TRACTOR ENGINE. LOWE stops, alert to possible danger.
MARTY: I ran out of gas.
ELMER: Spooky in there, ennit? It sure is! He looks back once more toward:
UNCLE AL: Well. it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription I told you!
MARTY: I told you!
UNCLE AL: Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed. Did you talk to the constable?
UNCLE AL: After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. ( Pause ) He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
MARTY: I told you!
JANE: Shut up, Marty. There's something else.
UNCLE AL: I probably shouldn't tell you- you're both hysterical on the subject. I'm starting to feel like a guy handing out free Arthur Murray coupons to victims of the dancing sickness.
MARTY: Uncle Al, if you don't tell me- He makes strangling gestures. I went out to that rest area. You found the tracer?
UNCLE AL: No. but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
MARTY: There! You see!
UNCLE AL: It could have been anything, Marty.
MARTY: What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
UNCLE AL: UNCLE AL comes over to JANE'S side of the Silver Bullet. He looks down at:
UNCLE AL: Lowe's car-?
JANE: Blue. This blue.
UNCLE AL: EXT. THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON Three-quarters full. THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the Tarker's Mills town hall. UNCLE AL'S sports car is parked out front.
HALLER: That's just about the craziest damn story I've ever heard, Al.
UNCLE AL: I know. I could have edited out all of the completely crazy stuff, but I thought you deserved to hear it with the bark on.
HALLER: I appreciate that. Now, the next question: Do you believe any of this? You do, don't you?
UNCLE AL: Let's just say I believe Lester Lowe should be checked out. HALLER rises.
HALLER: That can be arranged. They shake hands.
DAY: UNCLE AL has taken the Coslaw family station wagon today. The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees.
MARTY: Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
UNCLE AL: And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy? MARTY slips off his St. Christopher's medallion and hands it to UNCLE AL.
MARTY: I want you to turn this into a silver You're not going to let it go, are you?
UNCLE AL: You're not going to let it go, are you?
MARTY: I saw what I saw.
UNCLE AL: Marty, the moon wasn't even full! In the made-up stories, the guy who's the werewolf only changes when the moon is full. But maybe he's really that way almost all the time, only as the moon gets fuller. .the guy gets wolfier. Here. Take mine, too.
MARTY: Jane. you don't have to do that.
JANE: Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
MARTY: Will you marry me, Jane?
UNCLE AL: Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
JANE: I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
MARTY: No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
UNCLE AL: The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
MARTY: I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
UNCLE AL: Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
MARTY: Will you do it? UNCLE AL only looks at him, confused and unsure.
MARTY: Please, Uncle Al.
JANE: Will you? The St. Cristopher's medal and the crucifix are hanging from the rearview on a fine silver chain. UNCLE AL takes down the medal and looks at it.
UNCLE AL: All right. I give up. Yes.
UNCLE AL: If either of you ever tells anyone I even bought a piece of this story, werewolves will be the least of your problems.
MAC: Here it is.
MAC: Nicest piece of work I ever did, I think. It's got a low-grain load so it won't tumble. Should be pretty accurate.
UNCLE AL: It's just a gag, that's all. What would you shoot a silver .22 bullet at, anyway? How about a werewolf? ( Pause ) Happy Halloween, Al.
NAN: Remember, Al. we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
UNCLE AL: -and Babcock, I remember. Now go on! The station wagon backs farther and NAN leans out again.
NAN: And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
UNCLE AL: We won't! The station wagon backs out into the road and NAN pops out You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
NAN: You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
UNCLE AL: If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
NAN: I will- be good, kids.
UNCLE AL: Can I tell you kids something?
JANE: Sure, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL: When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
MARTY: Yeah? Really?
UNCLE AL: Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies. He ushers them inside and closes the door.
BOB: I can't believe that you'd agree to leave the kids with him. A year ago I would have laughed at the idea. You used to almost breathe fire when Al came in the house.
NAN: He's changed. Just this summer. Or something's changed him. Marty, maybe. And the drinking- I think it's almost stopped. Whatever it is, it's wonderful. And they'll be safe with him. I'm sure of it.
BOB: I know they'll be safe with him. but will he get them both into bed by nine-thirty? If I told him to, he will.
ANNOUNCER'S VOICE: This concludes WDML's broadcast day. The TV goes to snow.
UNCLE AL: I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
MARTY: But Uncle Al! You said-
UNCLE AL: I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
JANE: The moon's not down yet.
UNCLE AL: Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot. JANE gets up and starts toward the stairs.
MARTY: What if I say no?
UNCLE AL: Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy. ( more kindly ) Go on, now. MARTY begins to roll the Silver Bullet toward the stairs, where the stair chair awaits. JANE is waiting for him at the living-room doorway. MARTY sees the gun on the floor and If that'd gone off, it would have been the end of our silver bullet.
MARTY: If that'd gone off, it would have been the end of our silver bullet.
UNCLE AL: See, dear boy? Totally unimpaired. Behind him, the WEREWOLF'S head appears in the window, its green eye flaring.
UNCLE AL: A very familiar feeling is beginning to creep over me.
MARTY: What's that, Uncle Al?
UNCLE AL: I feel like a horse's ass.
JANE: Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
MARTY: INT. UNCLE AL
UNCLE AL: Would you kids go to bed? My head's starting to ache.
MARTY: It's here! It's outside!
UNCLE AL: Jane, it's just a power fai- He's starting toward her. At that moment most of the wall- not just the window it was looking through before but the whole wall- crashes inward as the WEREWOLF bulls its way through, roaring. UNCLE AL whirls, raising the pistol automatically to fire- but the cylinder is rolled out and all the chambers are empty. He has time to register surprise before the WEREWOLF smashes him aside.
MARTY: Get the gun! He uses his hands to propel the ungainly Silver Bullet into the hall.
WEREWOLF: Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty-
WEREWOLF: Bastard Marty!
WEREWOLF: Kill you.
WEREWOLF: Bastard Marty! It bends down, reaching.
JANE: I'm all right. but Marty! Ma-
UNCLE AL: If it isn't now, it will be after I pound one of your mother's silver candlesticks through its heart. Oh Uncle Al, no! Oh yes, Janey. When I believe something, I believe it all the way. He gets up and leaves.
JANE: Are you all right, Marty?
MARTY: All except my legs. I don't think I can walk.
JANE: You're a real booger, you know it? I love you, Jane.
