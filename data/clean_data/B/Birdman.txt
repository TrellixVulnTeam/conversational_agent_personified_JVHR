KOREAN: Flowers don't need you touch! They need you I hate this job.
SAM: ( Close into the screen. ) I hate this job.
RIGGAN: Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. He hurries out.
STAGE HAND路: Mr. Thomson.
RIGGAN: STAGE HAND路
STAGE HAND路: It's Daniel.
RIGGAN: ( Already passed. )
JAKE: How's it going, buddy.
RIGGAN: Great. It'd be even better if I could get Ralph to stop acting like he's in an educational video for
LESLEY: He loved me.
RALPH: Yeah. He loved her so much he tried to kill her.
LAURA: He tried to kill you?
LESLEY: No. ( A beat. ) Okay, well, he did beat me up one night. He dragged me around the living room by my ankles, yelling "I love you, I love
RALPH: How is that That is not love and you know it. Why do you insist on calling it
LESLEY: You can say what you want, but I know what it was.
RALPH: What about you, Nick? Does that sound like love to you?
RIGGAN: Sorry I'm late. I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't know the man. I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. You'd have to know the particulars. But I think what you're saying is that love is absolute.
RALPH: Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about is. The kind of love I'm talking about, you don't try and kill people.
LESLEY: ( Sadly. ) It was love, Mel. To Eddie, it was. I don't care what anybody says. He was ready to die for it.
RALPH: Ask her what he did after she left him.
LESLEY: He shot himself in the mouth. But he screwed that up, too. Poor Ed.
RALPH: Poor Ed, my ass. The guy was dangerous.
LAURA: How'd he screw it up if he shot himself in the mouth?
RALPH: ( By the numbers. ) He used to carry this twenty-two. We lived like fugitives those days. I never knew
RIGGAN: ( Breaking character to direct. Okay. Fugitives are on the run, Ralph. How many times do I have to Fugitives are scared. Give me more of that.
RALPH: ( The same but louder. ) We lived like fugitives those days.
LAURA: Christ. What a nightmare.

LAURA: Holy shit.
LESLEY: Is he breathing?
JAKE: Someone call 911!
LAURA: Is that blood coming out of his Where are you going?

CREW MEMBER路: How's Ralph?
RIGGAN: He'll be fine.
JAKE: Wait. Wait. Fuck. Wait.
RIGGAN: Listen to me. It was going to be a disaster. That guy's the worst actor I've ever seen. The blood coming out of his ear was the most honest thing he's done so far.
JAKE: He's not that bad.
RIGGAN: I'll make something up.
JAKE: What do you mean?
RIGGAN: I ( A beat. ) I made it happen.

JAKE: ( Sticking his head in. ) Ralph'll sue us. He'll sue us. And he's got a case.
RIGGAN: Then make him go away.
JAKE: How do you suggest I do that?
RIGGAN: You're my lawyer, my producer and my oldest friend. We are going to make this work. Now just get out there and do what you were born to What's that?
JAKE: What's that?
RIGGAN: I have no idea. But I have faith. Now go away from me.
JAKE: Do you think we should .and when we come back, an exclusive interview with Robert Downey Jr., who tells us about the billion-dollar Iron Man franchise. The talented actor invited us onto the set of Iron Man 3.
BLOND WOMAN: .and when we come back, an exclusive interview with Robert Downey Jr., who tells us about the billion-dollar Iron Man franchise. The talented actor invited us onto the set of Iron Man 3.

CLARA: I know. But did you do it?
RIGGAN: Are you afraid at all that people will say you're doing this play to battle the impression that you're a washed-up super No. I'm not. And that's exactly why 20 years ago I refused to do Birdman 4.
GABRIEL: Are you afraid at all that people will say you're doing this play to battle the impression that you're a washed-up super No. I'm not. And that's exactly why 20 years ago I refused to do Birdman 4.

RIGGAN: What pictures?
JAKE: The guy has a thing for nuns. in diapers. What do you care? You shouldn't have any knowledge about it anyway. The important thing is that I made him go away.
RIGGAN: Right. That's great.
JAKE: Yeah, it's fantastic. One problem. We don't have an actor. And if we cancel the first preview the press will smell the blood. We can't afford to lose any more money. At What do you want me to do?
RIGGAN: What do you want me to do?

JAKE: Riggan, listen to me
RIGGAN: No. You listen to me. Get him the fuck out of my play. Did you see him out there?
JAKE: It was a preview! Nobody gives a shit about previews. Nothing matters until that old bat from the New York Times is sitting in that audience on opening night.
RIGGAN: We're getting rid of him. I'm not going to stand up on that stage and
JAKE: Shut up! Just shut up for once and listen to me. As soon as we announced he was taking over, the advance doubled. We can't afford to lose a preview. We can't afford to lose money. We can't afford to lose Mike. This is about being respected, validated, remember? That's what you told me. That's how you got me into this shit. Now, you're the director. Get him under control. These are not the nineties anymore.
RIGGAN: ( Startled. ) Holy Fuck!
MIKE: ( Like he's possessed. ) You were good.
RIGGAN: Meet me in front of the theater in 10 minutes.
RIGGAN: I didn't know you were here tonight.

SYLVIA: Well. I know how much this means to you, so
RIGGAN: I appreciate that.
SYLVIA: So, how's it going?
RIGGAN: The play?
SYLVIA: No, you and Sam.
RIGGAN: It's good. ( A beat. ) It's the same.
SYLVIA: Do you talk to her?
RIGGAN: We talk. We I don't know, it's been crazy around here.
SYLVIA: You understand where her head is at right Of course.
RIGGAN: Of course.
SYLVIA: She's trying to stay away from everything and everyone that got her into rehab in the first place, but.
RIGGAN: .I know, Sylvia.
SYLVIA: .But that's all she had. So she's
RIGGAN: I really do get it.
SYLVIA: I know you're caught up in all this stuff, You know what I mean. Riggan. You don't have to be a great father right now, you just have to be one.
RIGGAN: You know what I mean. Riggan. You don't have to be a great father right now, you just have to be one.
SYLVIA: You know what I mean. Riggan. You don't have to be a great father right now, you just have to be one.
RIGGAN: Suddenly, Laura opens the door and sticks her head in.
LAURA: ( Noticing Sylvia. ) Oh, sorry.
SYLVIA: So how is that going? Is she and I don't wanna talk about it.
RIGGAN: I don't wanna talk about it.
SYLVIA: You're drinking?
RIGGAN: I'm having a beer.
SYLVIA: He sits and sips in silence for a moment. Then he begins to take out the wig.
RIGGAN: So, what's going on with you?
SYLVIA: Me? Nothing. Everything's the same I guess. I'm going back to teaching.
RIGGAN: I'm thinking about refinancing the Malibu Wh I'm sorry?
SYLVIA: Wh I'm sorry?
RIGGAN: I'm thinking about
SYLVIA: No, I heard you. I just need a second to ( A beat. ) That's gonna be Sam's house. Why would you ( A beat. ) What? For this play?
RIGGAN: ( Honest and vulnerable. ) I need the money.
SYLVIA: Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds?
RIGGAN: What do you want me to say? My health lasted longer than the money. Go figure that out.
SYLVIA: ( Beat. ) What's going on?. Look at me.
RIGGAN: I have a chance to do something right. And I have to take it. I have to.
SYLVIA: It's funny. I was sitting here waiting for you, and all of a sudden I couldn't remember why we broke up.
RIGGAN: The last time I flew here from LA, George Clooney was sitting two seats in front of me. With those cuff links, and that. chin. We ended up flying through this really bad storm. The plane started to rattle and shake, and everyone on board was crying. and praying. And I just sat there Sat there thinking that when Sam opened that paper it was going to be Clooney's face on the front page. Not mine. ( A beat. ) Did you know that Farrah Fawcett died on the same day as Michael Why did we break up?
SYLVIA: ( Looks him in the eye. ) You threw a kitchen knife at me.
RIGGAN: I will.
SYLVIA: You're not Farrah Fawcett, Riggan.
RIGGAN: ( To the poster. ) Shut up.
RIGGAN: ( Almost whispering. ) Leave me alone.
ANNIE: The sun bed is here.
RIGGAN: What does that mean?
ANNIE: It means there's a sun bed out there being delivered to in here.
RIGGAN: Who ordered a sun bed?
ANNIE: Mike. He says it's for his character. Carver's red necks, "people of the land". Part of his process and that
RIGGAN: Let's go. Walk.
MIKE: Where are we going?
RIGGAN: To get you some coffee. Have I done anything to disrespect you?
MIKE: Not yet.
RIGGAN: I have a lot riding on this play.
MIKE: Is that right?
RIGGAN: People know who I am, and
MIKE: Bullshit. People don't know you. They know the guy in the bird suit. They know the guy who tells those quaint, slightly vomitous stories on Letterman.
RIGGAN: Bullshit. People don't know you. They know the guy in the bird suit. They know the guy who tells those quaint, slightly vomitous stories on Letterman.
MIKE: Bullshit. People don't know you. They know the guy in the bird suit. They know the guy who tells those quaint, slightly vomitous stories on Letterman.
RIGGAN: Well, I'm sorry for being popular, but ( With irony. ) Popular? POPULAR?. Oh God, popularity is just the slutty little cousin of prestige.
MIKE: ( With irony. ) Popular? POPULAR?. Oh God, popularity is just the slutty little cousin of prestige.
RIGGAN: Okay, I don't even know what that
MIKE: My reputation is riding on this play. And that's. That is.
RIGGAN: A lot?
MIKE: A lot. Exactly. Fuck you. Yes. This doesn't work out for you, you get to go home to your studio pals and jump right back into that cultural genocide you guys are perpetrating. "There's a douchbag born every minute". That was P.T. Barnum's premise when he got rich inventing the circus. And you and your pals know nothing's changed, and whatever toxic shit you make people are still gonna pay to see it. But, after you're gone, I'll still be here. I'll still be making my living on the stage. Baring my soul. Wrestling with emotions, complex emotions.
RIGGAN: Right. Is that what tonight was about then? ( Mocking him. ) Wrestling with "complex Tonight was about making it alive. About making it bleed. This isn't the Warner Brothers lot, Riggan. This is the city, and this is how we do things.
MIKE: Tonight was about making it alive. About making it bleed. This isn't the Warner Brothers lot, Riggan. This is the city, and this is how we do things.
RIGGAN: Where are you going?
MIKE: They have coffee in here.
MIKE: ( To bartender. ) Thanks, Tommy.
RIGGAN: ( Getting back on point. ) People were laughing in our faces.
MIKE: ( Handing Riggan a drink. ) Tonight they were laughing, tomorrow they'll be. be.. tweeting about us. Fuck `em. Who cares??? These are the people who pay half price to watch us rehearse. Stop fucking caring!
RIGGAN: We're doing Raymond Carver. This play is a drama. This play is
MIKE: You don't know what this play is. These are previews. This is where we find out what the play is.
RIGGAN: Tabitha Dickinson. Yes. And, believe it or not, the only thing that matters in theater is whether she likes us or not. She does, we run. She doesn't, we're fucked.
MIKE: Tabitha Dickinson. Yes. And, believe it or not, the only thing that matters in theater is whether she likes us or not. She does, we run. She doesn't, we're fucked.
RIGGAN: ( Preoccupied. ) She does look like she licked a homeless guy's ass.
MIKE: Do me a favor, don't get your panties in a twist over a preview, alright? And don't tell me how to do my job. Cause, this is my town. And, to be honest, nobody gives a shit about you around here.
HUSBAND: ( Timidly. ) We're sorry to interrupt.
LADY: Would you mind terribly if we got a Of course. It's no trouble at all.
RIGGAN: Of course. It's no trouble at all.
LADY: ( To Mike. ) Would you mind?
KID: Who is this guy?
LADY: ( To his son. ) Come on, Billy. He used to be like Batman.
HUSBAND: We really appreciate it.
MIKE: Are we good here? Cause I'm gonna go.
RIGGAN: See you tomorrow.
MIKE: Why Raymond Carver? You never told me.
RIGGAN: A long time ago, I did a play back in high school in Michigan. He was in the audience. He sent this backstage after.
MIKE: "Thank you for an honest performance. Ray Carver." What is this?
RIGGAN: And that's when I knew I was going to be an actor.
MIKE: He wrote it on a cocktail napkin.
RIGGAN: Mike slides the napkin back to Riggan.
MIKE: He was drunk.
TABITHA: You headed to Hollywood, Mike?
MIKE: Hollywood's headed here, Tabby.
TABITHA: ( A devilish smile. ) Good luck with that.
MIKE: "A man becomes a critic when he can not be an artist, in the same way that a man becomes an informer when he cannot be a soldier." Flaubert, right?
TABITHA: He's a Hollywood clown in a Lycra bird Yeah. And at 8 o'clock tomorrow, he's gonna get on stage and risk everything. What're you gonna be doing?
MIKE: Yeah. And at 8 o'clock tomorrow, he's gonna get on stage and risk everything. What're you gonna be doing?
TABITHA: Don't you ever worry that I'll give you a bad review?
MIKE: Oh, I'm sure you will. If I ever give a bad Ms. Dickinson.
TABITHA: Mr. Shiner.
RIGGAN: What're you still doing here?
SAM: ( Continues scribbling. ) Nothing. I'm Nothing. Your costumes are hanging in your room.
RIGGAN: I got the coconut water you wanted. If you want me to get
SAM: I got the coconut water you wanted. If you want me to get
RIGGAN: I'm not sure if I said thank you.
SAM: I'm not sure if I said thank you.
RIGGAN: I'm not sure if I said thank you.
SAM: For what?
RIGGAN: All of it. You've been doing a good job. And I've been.
SAM: So, I just wanted to say that What is that?
RIGGAN: So, I just wanted to say that What is that?
SAM: That smell.
RIGGAN: That smell.
SAM: I don't
RIGGAN: Look at me.
SAM: What are you
RIGGAN: Look at me.
SAM: ( Continuing to search. ) You have to be shitting me. Where is it?
RIGGAN: ( Continuing to search. ) You have to be shitting me. Where is it?
SAM: Could we not do this?
RIGGAN: What is this?
SAM: That is chunky peanut butter that happens, by the way, to have Omega
RIGGAN: Oh. That's pot.
SAM: Oh. That's pot.
RIGGAN: Alright, just relax.
SAM: Alright, just relax.
RIGGAN: Relax? What the hell are you doing?
SAM: Protecting myself from cataracts?
RIGGAN: You can't do this to me!
SAM: To you?
RIGGAN: SHUT UP! You know what I'm talking about.
SAM: Yeah. You're talking about you. What else is new?
RIGGAN: Don't try to
SAM: What? Make it about me? I wouldn't dream of Listen to me. I'm trying to do something that's important.
RIGGAN: Listen to me. I'm trying to do something that's important.
SAM: This is not important.
RIGGAN: It's important to me! Alright? Maybe not to you, or your cynical playmates whose sole ambition is to end up going viral and who, by the way, will only be remembered as the generation that finally stopped talking to one another. But to me. To me. This is God. This is my career, this is my chance
SAM: Means something to who? You had a career before the third comic book movie, before people began to forget who was inside the bird costume. You're doing a play based on a book that was written 60 years ago, for a thousand rich, old white people whose only real concern is gonna be where they go to have their cake and coffee when it's over. Nobody gives a shit but you. And let's face it, Dad, it's not for the sake of art. It's because you just want to feel relevant again. Well, there's a whole world out there where people fight to be relevant every day. And you act like it doesn't even exist! Things are happening in a place that you willfully ignore, a place that has already forgotten you. I mean who are you? You hate bloggers. You make fun of twitter. You don't even have a Facebook page. You're the one who doesn't exist. You're doing this because you're scared to death, like the rest of us, that you don't matter. And you know what? You're right. You don't. It's not important. You're not important. Get used to it.
LAURA: ( To the audience as soliloquy. ) In the days before Nick's depression really started to eat away at him, he had no idea I was pregnant. And I never intended on telling him. I guess we make choices in life, and we choose to live with them. Or not. I didn't want that baby. .Not because I didn't love Nick. And not because I didn't love the The idea of it. But because I just wasn't ready to love myself. There's a certain distance to it all now. A wistful distance. Underscored by a gentle breeze and the sound of the birds. laughing at the whimsy of it all.
MIKE: ( Whispering. ) Hey, Les.
LESLEY: ( Whispering. ) I'm hard.
MIKE: I'm hard.
LESLEY: No, you're not. It's just that sometimes you don't consider other people's feelings.
MIKE: No. I'm hard. Feel.
LESLEY: Oh, you gotta be kidding.
MIKE: Let's really do this. Let's fuck.
LESLEY: Are you crazy? No.
MIKE: I'm Mel. Not Mike. Mel.
LESLEY: Mike hops out of bed, unaware of the very noticeable erection protruding underneath his pajama bottoms. Some laughter from the audience.
RIGGAN: ( To Lesley. ) Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for you. I worshipped you.
MIKE: Listen Ed, I know this is hard but
RIGGAN: ( to Mike ) Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you.
LESLEY: Eddie! Please!
RIGGAN: What's wrong with me? Why do I end up having to beg people to love me?
LESLEY: Ed. Eddie. Please. Give me the gun.
RIGGAN: I just wanted to be what you wanted. Now I spend every fucking minute praying to be someone else. Someone I'm not. Anyone.
MIKE: Put down the gun, Ed. She just doesn't love you anymore.
RIGGAN: ( A sad smile. ) You don't, do you?
LESLEY: ( With sympathy. ) And you never will.
RIGGAN: And you never will.
LESLEY: I'm sorry.
RIGGAN: ( A revelation. ) I don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't exist. None of this matters.
MIKE: Just, keep your voice down.
LESLEY: ( Furious. ) You have to be shitting me. You can't get it up in six months.
MIKE: What do you want from me? I have to feel it. You know that. I told you that from the
LESLEY: Oh, fuck you.
MIKE: .I was in the moment.
LESLEY: I told you to stop. You fucking animal.
MIKE: But. You were incredible.
LESLEY: What is wrong with you?
MIKE: Listen I'm sorry, alright, I
LESLEY: I want your shit out of the apartment. Can we
MIKE: Can we
LESLEY: No we can't. Maybe up here you're Mr. Truth, Mike. But in the real world, where it counts, you're a fraud. How's that for truth? You.
LAURA: What's going on?
LESLEY: He's an asshole.
LAURA: What did he do now?
LESLEY: Oh, nothing. He just tried to fuck me in front of a full house.
LAURA: Oh, my God.
LESLEY: That's kind of hot.
LAURA: That's kind of hot.
LESLEY: Why don't I have any self-respect?
LAURA: You're an actress, honey.
LESLEY: I'm pathetic. You know, I've dreamt of being a Broadway actress since I was a little kid. And now I'm here. And I'm not a Broadway actress. I'm still just a little kid. And I keep waiting for someone to tell me I made it.
LAURA: ( Hiding how moved she is. ) Hey. You made it.
LESLEY: I did?
LAURA: Sadly, it was with Mike Shiner, on a fake motel bed, in front of
LESLEY: ( A little laugh. ) Shut. Up.
RIGGAN: Is she okay?
LAURA: She's gonna be fine.
RIGGAN: None of this is your fault. You're beautiful. And talented. And I'm lucky to have you. Okay?
LESLEY: Riggan leaves the room. Laura leans on the makeup table.
RIGGAN: Riggan leaves the room. Laura leans on the makeup table.
LESLEY: That was very sweet.
LAURA: Laura is suddenly teary.
LESLEY: What's wrong?
LAURA: ( Smiling. ) Nothing. Two years, he's never said anything like that to me.
LESLEY: ( Into her eyes. ) Hey. You're smart. And beautiful. And talented. And I'm lucky to have you. Okay?
LAURA: We're gross.
LESLEY: We are.
LAURA: Laura kisses Lesley tenderly on the lips. Lesley seems confused. A few seconds of silence. Then.
LESLEY: Do it again.
MIKE: ( To Lesley. ) Can we talk about this like two
LESLEY: FUCK YOU!!! Okay, well, you're not ready.
FUCK YOU!!!: Okay, well, you're not ready.
MIKE: Okay, well, you're not ready.
MIKE: ( Holding the gun. ) Your gun is ridiculous. It looks like a plastic toy. And it still has the red plug in the barrel. ( Shows the plug. ) You look like a seven year old when you're holding it. I'm not threatened by it at all.
MIKE: I don't think it's high enough.
SAM: Me neither.
MIKE: So, what are you doing up here?
SAM: ( Hesitant. ) Adrenaline. Just came out of rehab. Closest I get to a drug.
MIKE: You were in rehab?
SAM: ( Distant. ) It wasn't all Dr. Drew or anything, but that dude from American Pie was there.
MIKE: It wasn't all Dr. Drew or anything, but that dude from American Pie was there.
SAM: It wasn't all Dr. Drew or anything, but that dude from American Pie was there.
A VOICE: ( From the street below. ) ( Calling down. ) Eat me!
SAM: ( Calling down. ) Eat me!
A VOICE: Okay. Jump on my face!
SAM: ( To Mike. ) I love this city.
MIKE: ( Casually. ) Why do you act like a dick all the time? Do you just do it to antagonize people?
SAM: ( Casually. ) Why do you act like a dick all the time? Do you just do it to antagonize people?
MIKE: Sam turns and faces Mike.
SAM: You really don't give a shit if people like you or not.
MIKE: Not really.
SAM: ( More comfortable. ) God, that's cool.
MIKE: Is it.?

MIKE: That's a second question.
SAM: It's a second part.
MIKE: I'd be afraid I couldn't get it up.
SAM: That didn't seem to be a problem for you on Nothing's a problem for me on stage.
MIKE: Nothing's a problem for me on stage.
SAM: I wanna ask another question.
MIKE: You just asked

SAM: G'night, Mike.
RIGGAN: What now?

LAURA: What photo?
RIGGAN: The one you liked. The one you said I look like a young Jack Nicholson.
LAURA: ( She lights a candle. ) Don't worry about it. Someone'll be using that to pick up dog shit tomorrow.
RIGGAN: How can you be so calm about this?
LAURA: What are my other choices?
RIGGAN: Aren't you scared at all?
LAURA: About what?
RIGGAN: About being humiliated out there.

RIGGAN: You said the first Fuck the Arts section. The first thing that came to mind? Right. Cause that's you. Mr. Natural. Mr. Fuck the scene, just stare at my massive hard-on. Because that's the truth of the moment.
MIKE: You think it looked massive?
RIGGAN: Shut up. Shut the fuck up. You don't get hard on my stage unless I tell you to.
MIKE: Your stage? This stage belonged to a lot of great actor's, pal. But you are not one of

JAKE: Okay. Well, I'm gonna do that. You know I'm proud of you, right? This took balls. And you did it.
RIGGAN: I can't do this anymore, Jake.
JAKE: I think I'm gonna cancel the preview. I'm exhausted.
RIGGAN: I think I'm gonna cancel the preview. I'm exhausted.
JAKE: It's a joke, right? ( He forces a laugh. ) Good one, Riggan.
RIGGAN: I'm starting to believe that this is not for me. The applause is. lukewarm. I think they're laughing at me.
JAKE: What are you? Listen. There's a three block line of people waiting to see you. We are sold out. It's a full house.
RIGGAN: Yes. And the French embassador is coming. And the prince of Saudi Arabia, with one of his wives. And. I wasn't going to tell you this, but Martin Scorsese. He's casting for his new film. But don't tell anyone, okay? This is between you and me.

RIGGAN: Okay. I'll be ready.
LESLEY: How is he?
JAKE: He'll be okay.
LESLEY: Poor creature.
LAURA: Is it true? Scorsese?
JAKE: Yes. And the new Pope too.
LAURA: You're an asshole, Jake.
JAKE: I'm the one keeping this boat afloat.
LESLEY: So there is no line of people out there?
JAKE: I don't know. Now go and get ready. That's your job. I'll better invest in a taco truck, or a strip joint near the airport.
LESLEY: Are you okay?
RIGGAN: ( Smiles. ) Yeah, I This is nothing. Shaving.
LESLEY: I just want to say I'm sorry.
RIGGAN: For what?
LESLEY: I knew what Mike was capable of, and I brought him in, anyway.
RIGGAN: You did good.
LESLEY: Tomorrow's my first opening night on Broadway.
RIGGAN: Mine too.
LESLEY: And I want you to know that, whatever happens, I'll always be grateful to you for that.
RIGGAN: Me too. It's going to be great. Full She looks at him with tender eyes. Then we follow her along the corridor until she passes by Mike's dressing room. Mike half-opens the door and sees Lesley walking by. He has a black eye. He waits for Lesley to be completely gone, and then he comes out of his dressing room and we follow him up the stairs to.
MIKE: For fuck's sake, just jump already.
SAM: How did you know I'd be up here?
MIKE: I didn't. I was just hoping.
SAM: Where's Lesley?
MIKE: Moving on.

MIKE: I appreciate that.
SAM: Ready for the last preview? Who did that to you?
MIKE: What's the worst thing he ever did to
SAM: He was never around, so.
MIKE: That was?
SAM: No. That was Who gives a shit. It was the way he tried to make up for it by constantly trying to convince me I was special. ( A beat. ) What about you?
MIKE: My dad?
SAM: He pretended I was his son.
MIKE: He pretended I was his son.
SAM: So, what happens now?
MIKE: I have no idea.

MIKE: How do you go out there and pretend to be someone else in front of all those people?
SAM: How do you go out there and pretend to be someone else in front of all those people?
MIKE: I don't pretend. Not out there. Just about every place else, but never out there.
SAM: Good to know.
MIKE: What are we doing here?
SAM: What do you mean?
MIKE: I mean, what are we doing here?
SAM: They kiss. The camera begins to drift down toward the stage.
LESLEY: ( In genuine tears. ) That's terrible. ( Beat. ) Perfect. And terrible. ( Taking this in. ) Yeah. So I guess what we have to ask ourselves is. What do we talk about when we talk about love?
RIGGAN: ( Taking this in. ) Yeah. So I guess what we have to ask ourselves is. What do we talk about when we talk about love?
LESLEY: Mel and I have been together five years, been married for four. But it was Ed who taught me something no one else could. He taught me what it felt like to really feel loved. And the terrible thing is that if something happened to Mel or myself, if something happened to either one of us tomorrow, I think the other one would grieve for a while, you know, but then would go
DRESSER: That was amazing!
LAURA: ( A bit distant. ) It's actually going well.

LAURA: Awful. Would have raised, like.
RIGGAN: .a serial killer.
LAURA: .or Justin Bieber.
RIGGAN: You have a cigarette?

RIGGAN: Great. Great.
SAM: So. Opening night, tomorrow.
RIGGAN: That's exciting, huh?
SAM: That's exciting, huh?
RIGGAN: Yeah. Well. I don't know. The previews have been a train wreck. We haven't been able to get through a performance without a raging fire. or a raging hard-on. I'm not really sleeping, you know, at all. And I'm pretty much broke. Oh, and also, this play feels like a miniature, deformed version of myself that keeps following me around, hitting me in the balls with a tiny hammer. Sorry, what was your question?
SAM: ( Looking through phone. ) Never mind. Tonight wasn't bad. It was weird. But that's sort of cool. People seemed to like it.
RIGGAN: What are you doing? Some homework?
SAM: No. I don't When I was in rehab, they made us do this.
RIGGAN: Yeah. These dashes, represent the six billion years the planet has existed. Each dash represents 100 years.
SAM: Yeah. These dashes, represent the six billion years the planet has existed. Each dash represents 100 years.
RIGGAN: ( Casually. ) I was a shitty father, wasn't I?
SAM: No. You were a ( She stops herself. ) You were fine.
RIGGAN: Fine. You're right. I am just "fine". Adorably mediocre.
SAM: ( CONTINUED ) 10/29/14 / 89.
RIGGAN: ( CONTINUED ) 10/29/14 / 89.
SAM: ( Smiling. ) It's okay. You just destroyed the entire human race in one blow.
RIGGAN: Really? What does that mean?
SAM: 350,000 views in less than an hour. Believe it or not, this is power.
RIGGAN: It's for you.
SAM: ( Hesitant. ) Are you.?
RIGGAN: A sympathetic smile. An understanding. Sam exits. Riggan stares into the mirror absently. His eyes locked on his reflection trying to find himself in the image. Then he spots a vase with dying roses, the same roses he flung to the ground previously.
RIGGAN: Let me have another one.
BARTENDER: You got it.
RIGGAN: ( Hands the waiter a bill. ) I got it. She's a friend of mine.
TABITHA: I don't care.
RIGGAN: I'm just saying, when you come tomorrow night, I want you
TABITHA: It doesn't matter.
RIGGAN: What are you
TABITHA: I'm going to destroy your play.
RIGGAN: You haven't even seen it. I don't Did I do something to offend you?
TABITHA: As a matter of fact you did. You took up space in a theater which otherwise might have been used on something worthwhile.
RIGGAN: But you don't even know if it's
TABITHA: That's true. I haven't read a word of it, or even seen a preview, but after the opening tomorrow I'm going to turn in the worst review anybody has ever read. And I'm going to close your play. Would you like to know why? Because I hate you. And everyone you represent. Entitled. Spoiled. Selfish. Children. Blissfully untrained, unversed and unprepared to even attempt real art. Handing each other awards for cartoons and
RIGGAN: What has to happen in someone's life, for them to end up becoming a critic?
TABITHA: I will call the police.
RIGGAN: No you won't. Let's read your review! "Callow". A label. "Lackluster". Label. "Marginalia". Sounds like you need penicillin to clear that up. None the less. label. All labels. You're a lazy fucker aren't you? Epistemological vertigo? You know what this is? You don't, do you? You can't even see it if you don't label it. You mistake those sounds in your head for true knowledge.
TABITHA: Are you finished?
RIGGAN: ( Wrinkling one of the pages. ) Nothin' about intention, structure,
TABITHA: You think you're an actor?
WAITER: Yeah, Mrs. Dickinson?
TABITHA: Give us some Shakespeare.
WAITER: No problem. Got anything in mind?
TABITHA: The Scottish Play. Act five.
WAITER: Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools. The way to dusty death.
TABITHA: Thank you, Eddie.
WAITER: You got it.
TABITHA: ( To Riggan. A derisive laugh. ) You're no actor. You're a celebrity. Let's be clear on that.
BIRDMAN: You spent your whole life building a reputation and a bank account, and now they're both blown. So what? Fuck it. We make a come back. Something huge. Take what belongs to us.

RIGGAN: You wanna hear something funny?

RIGGAN: Do you remember our last anniversary party?
SYLVIA: Seriously? You're going to ruin a nice moment with that?
RIGGAN: Do you remember the party?
SYLVIA: The party where you fucked Janet Rossbach in our bed? Yeah, it rings a bell.
RIGGAN: Yeah, well. Let's skip over that part for a minute.
SYLVIA: After you threw the guests out of the house, and the furniture out of the window. You locked yourself in the I remember. Why are we

RIGGAN: Until I walked straight into the water and tried to drown myself.
SYLVIA: You said it was a sunburn.
RIGGAN: ( Smiling. ) And you believed me.
SYLVIA: To be honest, I didn't give a shit.
RIGGAN: I love you. And I love Sam.
SYLVIA: I know.
RIGGAN: I never should have video taped Sam's birth. First of all because you and Sam both look like shit in that video. But mostly because I missed the moment. I should have just been there with the two of you. Present in my own life. So I'd have it. But, I don't. I don't have any of You have Sam.
SYLVIA: You have Sam.
RIGGAN: No, I don't.
SYLVIA: Listen, she's just

SYLVIA: ( Putting a finger on Shhh. There are more pathetic things than that. That mustache, for example.

RIGGAN: You should get back to your seat. You don't want to miss what's next.

RIGGAN: ( Brushing her off. ) I don't need it.
LESLEY: Ed! What are you doing here?
RIGGAN: ( Almost whispering. ) Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for you I worshipped you.
MIKE: Listen Ed, I know this is hard but
RIGGAN: What's wrong with me? Why do I end up having to beg people to love me?
LESLEY: Ed. Eddie. Please. Give me the gun.
RIGGAN: I just wanted to be what you wanted. Now I spend every fucking minute praying to be someone else. Someone I'm not. Anyone.
MIKE: Put down the gun, Ed. She just doesn't love you anymore.

MAN: The audience, one by one, jump to their feet, applauding wildly. The sole exception is Tabitha, who remains seated, a dazed expression on her face. We stay with the audience a few seconds longer.
HOST: What do we talk about when we talk about Riggan Thomson? When we come back, more on the actor who two nights ago shot himself during the opening performance of his new Broadway play. Is he.?
JAKE: Is he.?

SYLVIA: I don't believe this.
JAKE: Read it out loud!
