DENT: If elected, my first act as district attorney will be to return an indictment against Boss Carl
DENT: ( on the TV screen ) Together we can make Gotham city a safe place for decent people to live and work and play. Decent people shouldn't live here. They'd be much happier someplace
JACK NAPIER: Decent people shouldn't live here. They'd be much happier someplace
ALICIA: Anything new?
JACK: The usual gas. If this clown could lay a hand on Grissom. I would've had to kill him by now.
ALICIA: If Grissom knew about might kill you.
JACK: Don't think so, angel. I'm too valuable. That's the way I've planned it. And besides, he doesn't know.
ALICIA: You look just fine, Jack.
JACK: . I didn't ask.

ECKHARDT: Variety, huh? The spice of life.
PATROLMAN: They found him hugging a drainpipe. He was scared to come off the roof.
KNOX: Great, but tell me: is this another you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's the third one this week.
PATROLMAN: ( testily ) I dunno. What's "what"?
KNOX: Good answer. I'm gonna put you in for a commendation.
ECKHARDT: Oh Christ, it's Knox.
KNOX: Hiya, gents. This anything I should know about?
ECKHARDT: Nothing out of the routine.
NICK: He wanted me to do him a favor.!
KNOX: No offense, boys, but these guys are seeing something up there.
ECKHARDT: No comment. Print what you like.
KNOX: Come on. One question. Is there a six-foot bat in Gotham City? If so, is he on the police payroll? If so, what's he pulling down after
JACK: You didn't show up.
ECKHARDT: We had another bat sighting.
JACK: I'm sure that was vitally important. Listen: things are heating up. Someone is leaking information to Harvey Dent.
ECKHARDT: I'm doing the best I can. If it's a Eckhardt. our problems are your I'll work on it.
JACK: Eckhardt. our problems are your I'll work on it.
ECKHARDT: I'll work on it.

ECKHARDT: ( knocking his hands away ) I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You should be thinking about the future.
JACK: You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You should be thinking about the future.
ECKHARDT: ( nodding his head ) Forget it, Jack. You'll never run that organization.
JACK: And why's that?
ECKHARDT: You're a psycho, friend. You're an A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows

KNOX: Got any more of those?
VICKI: Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal here. What's new and hot in Gotham It's too good, Vick. We got a six- foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
KNOX: It's too good, Vick. We got a six- foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
VICKI: ( laughing ) Evildoers, huh? Big or small?
KNOX: Small so far. I mean they don't allow bats in boardrooms, do they.
VICKI: Speaking of which. I hear the notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.
KNOX: Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every law'n'order freak in the city's gonna be there. Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying Aw, Vicki. Vicki! Got a date? Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always loved you. Will you marry me?

VICKI: Yes, but please be gentle.
GRISSOM: Nine points ahead in the new poll. I don't like the way this is shaping
JACK: We can always pop him. Or pop someone close to him.
LIEUTENANT: Let's feed him to the bat.
GRISSOM: He's going after our front companies. Specifically Ace Chemical. Which would tie us in with Councilman Kane, Senator Miller. on up the line. We have to clean out our files before the subpoena comes down.
LIEUTENANT: How do we go? The usual fire?
GRISSOM: I'm thinking break-in. Trash the office, remove the relevant "Industrial espionage."
JACK: "Industrial espionage."
GRISSOM: That's right. And Jack I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
JACK: At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back and ALICIA HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private penthouse elevator. She's carrying a handful of SHOPPING BAGS.
GRISSOM: Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd mind waiting in the other room.
JACK: Why do you need simple break-in?
GRISSOM: ( emphatically ) Because I want someone I can We'll work out the details later. But it's got to be soon. All right, that's all for now. You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an important job. I can't trust it to somebody who'll screw up.
JACK: I understand.
GRISSOM: ( smiling ) Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck. My friend, your luck is just about to change. Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.
KNOX: How high up would you say that is?
ALFRED: I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
KNOX: You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
ALFRED: Which bathroom is that, air?
KNOX: The small one. Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You actually know all these people?
VICKI: Some. I I'm quoting.
KNOX: Yeah, I guess we move in different circles. Though I did meet a one-eyed pimp last week.
KNOX: Commissioner Gordon! What do you hear from our pointy-eared friend?
GORDON: Knox, for the ninth time, and you can quote me there is no bat.
KNOX: Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be one honest cop in Gotham city.
DENT: How's your luck, Jim?
KNOX: Mr. Dent. What's winged vigilantes?
DENT: Mr. Knox, I think we have enough real problems in this city without worrying about ghosts and goblins and Halloween characters.
KNOX: My question is, where does one man get all this junk.
VICKI: All over the world. They say he spends most of the year overseas until recently, anyway.
KNOX: Holy shit. . We found the arsenal. This guy has just gotten interesting. What else do you know?
VICKI: Just what I've heard. Rich. Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.
KNOX: Likes to kill?
VICKI: ( smiling ) Women find him magnetic.
KNOX: I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
VICKI: That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
KNOX: Well, you know me. The more they've got, the less they're worth. This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
BRUCE WAYNE: You disappoint me. Why not the
KNOX: I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host. Alexander Knox.

VOICE: The JOKER turns. ALICIA steps out of a ROOFTOP ELEVATOR and moves toward them, drugged, wraithlike. She's still wearing the porcelain DOLL'S MASK we saw earlier.
JOKER: ( to VICKI ) Christ, it's my girlfriend. ( to ALICIA )
WHAT?: You said I could look at the pictures before you before you
ALICIA: You said I could look at the pictures before you before you
JOKER: Shucks, honey, I forgot.
VICKI ): I'm in trouble This is business, sweetie. Why don't you go outside and see how the boys are coming?
VICKI: ( hesitantly ) . Why the mask?
JOKER: Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask. You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's beautiful. One in a million. A work of art. In She makes you look sick.
VICKI: You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!. You DID THAT to her!
JOKER: What? I
VICKI: I'll see you
JOKER: Miss Vale, was it something I said? Do you want to sniff my flower?
VICKI: The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB. A JET OF CLEAR LIQUID spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI. She GASPS. BUMPS INTO A TABLE. ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises from the floor where the clear liquid hit. Acid.
NO!: The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB. A JET OF CLEAR LIQUID spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI. She GASPS. BUMPS INTO A TABLE. ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises from the floor where the clear liquid hit. Acid.
JOKER: Come on, Miss Vale. STOP AND SMELL
THE ROSES!!: He backs VICKI into a corner. And then abruptly
THE BATMAN!: On his wrist is a STEEL GAUNTLET. Ha AIMS IT at the JOKER like a weapon. Then PIVOTS SUDDENLY POINTS HIS ARM
OUTSIDE!!: JOKER ( cont. )
. YOU!!: On the end of the spike is a CORD leading to BATMAN's belt. In the wink of an eye he's GRABBED VICKI DRAGGED HER OUT OF the tea room and PLUNGED OVER THE RAMP WALL, FOUR
BATMAN: GET IN THE CAR! . Oh.
VICKI: VICKI suddenly feels quite stupid. Because while there are many cars parked along the side alley there is only one BATMOBILE. The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and. well, indescribable. Imagine your own. VICKI climbs into the passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning array of electronic gadgetry.
BATMAN: As BATMAN sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny, synthesized VOICE repeats the command:
COMPUTER: The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the cockpit alongside VICKI. Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of the alley at ninety miles an hour. THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off.
JOKER: I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!!
VICKI: Look! Police!
BATMAN: I called them.
VICKI: Shouldn't we
GOON: There they are! Dead ahead!
JOKER: ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW!
VICKI: What about her? What about the girl?
BATMAN: ( gritting his teeth )
GODDAMMIT!: They're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION.
VICKI: Can't we
BATMAN: Too many people. Come on!
SHIELDS!!: The BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies:
COMPUTER: With a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into place across the cockpit, over the tires leaving the BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL. BATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE, vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble. INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT THREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE.
JOKER: . I don't know. We'd better get out of here. Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY??
GOON I: We got 'em!
BATMAN: How much do you weigh?
VICKI: . A hundred and eight?
BATMAN: HANG ON! Whatever happens DON'T LET GO!!
HANG ON!: The JOKER'S THUGS pile out of the car. The BATARANG catches on the catwalk, and BATMAN triggers the spring-action REEL on his utility belt jerking him and VICKI INTO THE AIR. BULLETS zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line. One story; two stories; and then. They slow. They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the Joker's goons advance. BATMAN wriggles, twists. They lurch upward another few feet and stop again. VICKI SCREAMS. Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism. They're stranded two stories up SITTING DUCKS. In the wink of an eye he's detached the reel from his own waist and hitched it around VICKI's belt. Before she has a chance to protest, he LETS GO. VICKI rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the way. BATMAN, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD. VICKI slams up into the catwalk and BOBS on the end of the line as BATMAN lands with a loud crash, overturning a row of garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash one per limb. Random kicking and flailing. BATMAN manages to slam two GOONS into a wall, but before he can get to his feet GOON #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull. BATMAN is down for the count. The THUGS dust themselves off and circle around his prostrate form, still wary. The LEAD THUG holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and fires TWO SHOTS, point-blank, at the yellow-and-black INSIGNE on BATMAN's chest. The body jerks. They move closer. And stop.
GOON I: GOON II GOON III
GOON II: GOON III
GOON III: Wait a minute.
GOON IV: . What

GOON I: He's human after all. Take that mask off.

GOON IV: Good idea. Let's check his wallet.
GOON I: We'll worry about it later. Plug In the head.
GOON III: Goddam, it's the redhead!
GOON II: Did you hit her?
GOON I: Who cares? Wax that freak.
BATMAN: . Not even a 'thank you'?
VICKI: Well I think you might consider thanking me. You were good as That's because you lied about your Thank you. I'll have to ask you for that film.
BATMAN: That's because you lied about your Thank you. I'll have to ask you for that film.

BATMAN: The Joker is a murderer. And were as good as dead. So
VICKI: Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
BATMAN: All right, here's a compromise. I'll develop the photos. You keep the Jokers and I'll keep the rest.
VICKI: How do I know you won't keep them Because I'll take you with me. Thank you, Vicki.
BATMAN: Because I'll take you with me. Thank you, Vicki.
VICKI: . Where are you going to take me?
BATMAN: Shields open.
COMPUTER: Shields open.

BATMAN: BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL. SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph.
