BURLESQUE: Written by Steven Antin
BURLESQUE: DRUM ROLL ends with a CYMBAL CRASH. The SCREEN goes BLACK. Then we hear an opening MUSIC "INTRO", a bawdy QUARTET. EXTREME CLOSE UP: RED LUSCIOUS LIPS. speaking directly into CAMERA in a smoky, sultry voice.
TESS: Once upon a time .a long, looong time ago. there was a good little girl.and they called her. REVEAL .TESS. A stunner with impossibly long lashes, theatrical make-up and a sequined, skin-tight band-aid of a dress. She works the tight stage of the club, toying with the AUDIENCE.
ALI: Uh, excuse me? You forgot He turns. Sees: ALI ROSE. One hand holding a bar rag, the other planted on her hip. Ali has a look that's all her own: short shorts, white platform sandals, hair piled up high, more make-up than the rest of Grundy's women combined. She's young 22 but has a confidence that's got nothing to do with age.
REGULAR: No, that's your tip.
ALI: Huh. See, now that's interesting you and I must do math completely differently, cause me? I start with the six beers I brought you, add the four spills I cleaned up, the five times I refilled your peanuts, plus the three times you "accidentally" touched my ass, then I tack on lying to your wife when she called looking for you, twice, and I come up with a sum that's a hell of a lot more than twenty-five Before the Regular can respond, Ali is joined by LORETTA 30's wearing every one of those years hard.
LORETTA: She's just teasing, Ike. You go on home now, and tell Kay I said hi. The Regular leaves. Loretta picks up the quarter.
ALI: Nothin's cheap. A quarter's an It'll cover half a load down at the Spanky Clean.
LORETTA: It'll cover half a load down at the Spanky Clean.
ALI: There's only one thing a quarter is good for. Ali takes the quarter and heads to the back of the room, passing a GEEZER who's sitting by himself, drinking alone.
LORETTA: Oh no, hon, now you know how Dwight feels about that.
ALI: Dwight isn't here. Ali stops in front of the rinky-dink karaoke machine.
LORETTA: He could come back any minute.
ALI: Tough. I'm not working here for the tips Loretta. She pops the quarter into the machine and chooses a song. She picks up the microphone and, after a few opening beats, starts singing ETTA JAMES'S "SOMETHING'S GOT A HOLD ON ME".
BURLESQUE GIRLS: WE INTERCUT:
ALI: I GET A FEELING THAT I NEVER, NEVER, NEVER HAD BEFORE, NO, NO . ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE the Girls belt out a raucous chorus.
BURLESQUE GIRLS: As other ENTERTAINERS appear onstage:
TESS: The insatiable La Puccini Triplets! Death-defying daredevils Missy and Kitten DeVille! The Countess of contortion, Eva Destruction! And how about a little love for those bad boys of burlesque, our naughty- bawdy bumber band! THE TATTOOED BAND blares as the troupe kicks in unison
ALI: I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, THAT, OOOH . ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, the GIRLS and the BAND, loud and IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali, letting loose now. Wailing.
BURLESQUE GIRLS: IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali, letting loose now. Wailing.
OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH!!: IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali, letting loose now. Wailing.
ALI: I BELIEVE, I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING'S GOT A HOLD ON ME, ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, the BURLESQUE GIRLS move in a line toward the audience, confident, sexy. The BARTENDERS, WAITRESSES and people working at the club sing along.
ALL: OH . IT MUST BE LOVE! BA-DA, BA-DA, BA-DA: IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali, letting it rip. The Geezer sips his beer, unmoved.
BARTENDERS: BA-DA, BA-DA, BA-DA: IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali, letting it rip. The Geezer sips his beer, unmoved.
ALI: I'VE GOT A FEELING, I FEEL SO STRANGE. EVERYTHING ABOUT ME SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED, STEP BY STEP, I GOT A BRAND NEW WALK, EVEN SOUND SWEETER WHEN I TALK. I SAID, OH. ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, The Girls.
BURLESQUE GIRLS: IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali.
ALI: OOOH. HEY BABY, IT MUST BE LOVE! ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, The Girls form a line.
BURLESQUE GIRLS: YOU KNOW IT MUST BE LOVE. IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali sings.
ALI: YOU KNOW IT WALK LIKE LOVE. IT TALK LIKE LOVE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, MAKE ME FEEL ALRIGHT: IN THE BURLESQUE LOUNGE, The Girls, Tess, the other Entertainers, Busboys, Waitresses, Bartenders and entire company do a BIG FINISH.
ALL: BA-DA, BA-DA, BA-DA, BA-DA! IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali finishes the song. Loretta CLAPS. The Geezer, unimpressed, gets up and leaves.
LORETTA: People around here wouldn't know talent if it bit 'em in the Danglies. Where you gotta go is Des Moines. They got karaoke bars where you can win a hundred bucks a Loretta when I get out of this butt-hole of a town, I sure as shit won't be heading for Des Moines. She hops up onto the bar, spins around on her butt, one leg up in the air like a Varga girl, then hops down on the other side then gets back to work.

TESS: Where the hell is Nikki?
SEAN: Rehab, if there's a God. The BACKSTAGE DOOR BURSTS OPEN revealing
NIKKI: I heard that. Nikki, a stunning, feisty brunette, sashays in
TESS: Jesus, Nikki, you're later than Georgia's period! Where were you?
NIKKI: Weave, wax, paws and claws. She drops her bag, quickly peels her clothes off, holds out her arms as Sean slips her corset onto her Tess eyes Nikki's body
TESS: Hold it right there. Weigh in. Nikki unwillingly steps on the scale. Tess shakes her head.
ALI: Nanna? Got your pot roast here!
ALI: They were out of steak fries, so I got you some of those. Then she stops in her tracks. Nanna 80's, housecoat, oxygen tank is slumped in her chair. The TV remote is on the floor. "ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT" is blaring.
YOUNG MINISTER: Dear Lord, we gather here today not to mourn, but to celebrate the life of Alison Rose.
ALI: YOUNG MINISTER
YOUNG MINISTER: She's Arlene. I'm Alison.
ALI: She's Arlene. I'm Alison.
YOUNG MINISTER: Oh, shit. ( then, befuddled ) Can I start over? Ali rolls her eyes.
LATER,: The Minister and the Cemetery worker walk away, leaving Ali and Loretta alone.
LORETTA: You were real good to her, Ali.
ALI: No, she was good to me. She rearranges the flowers resting on the plot, fixing it up.
LORETTA: Foster care. She took me in for the checks. When I turned eighteen, the money stopped coming. She could've kicked me out, but she didn't.
ALI: Foster care. She took me in for the checks. When I turned eighteen, the money stopped coming. She could've kicked me out, but she didn't.
LORETTA: Well, then I guess this is a blessing. Now she's free. ON ALI, thinking realizing:
ALI: ( talking about herself ) Yeah. I guess she is.
BURLESQUE GIRLS: In the wings, Tess watches with Sean.
TESS: Girls look good tonight.
SEAN: Amazing what a pink spotlight can do. Hides more cellulite than a GO, HONEY, GO!..' INT. ALI'S TRAILER - DAY Then she looks around the trailer and realizes - tough shit. Stuffs the money in a pocket, then pulls out a suitcase.
BURLESQUE GIRLS: GO, HONEY, GO!..' INT. ALI'S TRAILER - DAY Then she looks around the trailer and realizes - tough shit. Stuffs the money in a pocket, then pulls out a suitcase.
BURLESQUE GIRLS: GO, HONEY, GO!..' INT. ALI'S TRAILER - DAY THE SUITCASE, as Ali throws in her belongings. When it's full, she grabs a stack of records Jazz and Soul tries to fit them into the suitcase, but it won't close. She picks one: ETTA JAMES. She sticks it in the suitcase and zips it INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT OH, HONEY! INT. ALI'S TRAILER - DAY Ali reaches into a drawer, pulls out a FRAMED PHOTO of A YOUNG WOMAN, 20's, short dress, heavy make-up, holding hands with a 7-year-old girl.

DWIGHT: You're three days late.
ALI: I had a death in the family.
DWIGHT: And what, people stop drinking cause your grandma died? Get your apron and get to work.
ALI: I'm not here to work. I'm leaving.
LORETTA: You are?
ALI: ( TO DWIGHT )
DWIGHT: Payday's the end of the month.
ALI: But, I won't be here then. And you owe me for three weeks.
DWIGHT: I don't owe anyone anything till the end of the month. Ali sets down her suitcase and marches over to him.
ALI: You know what, Dwight? Contrary to what you've been told, there's no law in Grundy that says you have to spend every waking minute being a tight-fisted, cheap-ass prick
LORETTA: ( trying to intercede ) Ooh, hon, I'm not sure that particular approach is gonna
ALI: I've spent three years of my life
HERE: And you'll probably spend another three. You want to quit? Good riddance. I'll replace you before you hit the county line, but I sure ain't gonna pay for the privilege. He walks out the back door, slamming it behind him.
DWIGHT: And you'll probably spend another three. You want to quit? Good riddance. I'll replace you before you hit the county line, but I sure ain't gonna pay for the privilege. He walks out the back door, slamming it behind him.
LORETTA: What are you doing?
ALI: I'm only taking what he owes me.
LORETTA: Ali where are you gonna go?
ALI: Somewhere I can breathe. Now gimme a hug, I gotta get out of here before he gets back. Loretta hugs her tight, then looks Ali in the eye, concerned.
LORETTA: You can't just head off into the sunset without a plan.
ALI: ( RESOLUTE )
OLDER WOMAN: She'll be back. As Ali heads off, we HEAR:
BURLESQUE GIRLS: GO, HONEY, GO!..' INT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - GRUNDY, IOWA - DAY Ali is at the ticket counter.
ALI: How much to Los Angeles?
ALI: You're kidding, right?
SEAN: They're loving you tonight.
TESS: They're loving you.
SEAN: Oh, shucks, I just tell myself I'm writing for a big old drag queen.
TESS: Eat me. As he heads off with her discarded costume:
SEAN: A big old foul-mouthed drag queen! Tess looks in a mirror. As she makes the necessary adjustments, VINCE SCALI appears. 35, scruffy-handsome.
VINCE: Good show tonight. She glances up, sees him. Gets icy. Goes back to primping.
TESS: I got another call from Marcus And you told him we weren't He wants to raise his offer. I told him we'd hear him out. Tess spins around, looking him in the eye for the first time.
VINCE: I got another call from Marcus And you told him we weren't He wants to raise his offer. I told him we'd hear him out. Tess spins around, looking him in the eye for the first time.
TESS: And you told him we weren't He wants to raise his offer. I told him we'd hear him out. Tess spins around, looking him in the eye for the first time.
VINCE: He wants to raise his offer. I told him we'd hear him out. Tess spins around, looking him in the eye for the first time.
TESS: Vince, I don't care what the number is; the only way Marcus Gerber will get this club from me is by prying it out of my cold, dead, heavily- jeweled fingers. She pivots away and sweeps into the club.
BURLESQUE GIRLS: OH, HONEY!!. Big finish, the number on stage ends.
RADIO: 102.7 KIIS FM. Broadcasting from Hollywood and Vine. Ali perks up looks out the window as the bus rounds a bend and. THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN comes into view. NEW MUSIC UP:
ALI: ( THEN )
SKINNY GUY: Sorry, ladies, that's all the applications we're taking today. CLOSE ON: an ad: "DANCERS WANTED. PRETTY GIRLS ONLY."
ALI: I can dance.
DRUNK GUY: She'll be back.
ALEXIS: Like I said, LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH! ALEXIS, drag queen/door whore, also in full costume and make- up, TOSSES a GUY out the front door onto the street, then heads back inside Ali smiles to herself. Then turns back to look at COCO who disappears inside a BACK DOOR as.NIKKI walks out. Lights a ciggie. She has on full make-up. Lacquered lips. Lashes like peacock feathers. She sees Ali staring.
NIKKI: Didn't your Mama tell you it's not polite to stare?
ALI: Sorry, you're just so DAMN In that case, screw your Mama, stare away. Nikki strikes a pose, campy, showing Ali her best side. They both laugh.
NIKKI: ( WARMING )
AL I: No one would ever guess.
NIKKI: That you're a dude. Nikki's face turns to stone. Her eyes widen in horror. Ali sees the mistake she made. She's mortified.
ALI: That you're a dude. Nikki's face turns to stone. Her eyes widen in horror. Ali sees the mistake she made. She's mortified.
NIKKI: "Shit's" right, you little half-wit
TWAT: Nikki is about to unleash when the stage door opens.
SEAN: Bitch! You're on! Sean grabs her and drags her inside. As he does, a STRAND OF CRYSTAL BEADS comes off her costume, falls to the ground.
ALI: I'm really sor The stage door slams shut. Ali picks up the strand of beads. Holds them up in the light, watching them shimmer. She goes to the front of club, where a smattering of L.A. HIPSTERS enter. There's a GLASS DISPLAY CASE full of photos of the acts. Ali looks at the pictures of the Girls in their elaborate costumes and provocative poses. She's unintentionally made her way to the front door. Black curtains obscure her view inside. She peers in. HEARS cool music emanating. The sounds of a nightclub. Intriguing. She ventures inside.
ALEXIS: Alexis sits on a stool, glaring down at her.
I.D.?: Alexis sits on a stool, glaring down at her.
ALI: What is this place? A strip club?
ALEXIS: Strip club? Honey, I ought to wash your mouth out with Jaegermeister. The only pole you'll find in here is Natasha the shot girl. Ali looks back at the photos.
PART REVEALING: Smoother than honey and twice as sweet. Each girl lovelier then the next. Gentlemen, hold onto your hats. Ladies, hold on to your gentlemen. We may not have windows.. .but we DO have the best view on the Sunset Strip! MUSIC KICKS IN AS LIGHTS FLARE from the back of the stage, where Three Girls stand, backs to the audience, Fosse-style. Coco, Georgia, and Nikki strut downstage. Behind them, Girls MOVE AND DANCE on cabaret chairs. Totally raunchy, completely The girls hit the beats, turning upside-down on cabaret chairs, arched backs, legs reaching upward, bending over, asses to the audience, bodies writhing in air-tight choreography: thrusting hips, whipping heads, stomping feet. Ali watches, exhilarated, as the music builds and SWELLS to a full on performance with the entire ensemble

JACK: Get you a drink? She turns. A bartender is watching her watch. JACK - 25, punky, dark hair, eyeliner, one arm half-sleeved with tats.
ALI: Only if you're buying.
JACK: ( slides her a beer ) Welcome to L.A.
ALI: ( DISAPPOINTED )
JACK: You still have that new-car smell.
ALI: Not brand new. But still under Where you from? She looks back at the stage, mesmerized.
JACK: Where you from? She looks back at the stage, mesmerized.
ALI: Oh, yeah? Kentucky. We're practically related.
JACK: Oh, yeah? Kentucky. We're practically related.
ALI: I thought you looked familiar. He smiles. As Ali sips her free beer, Jack stacks drinks on a tray for a DITSY WAITRESS. He slides the tray to her. She doesn't notice. He barks at her:
JACK: Hey_. Go.
ALI: ( TO HERSELF )
JACK: They don't build 'em like this in Iowa, huh?
ALI: Hell no. I wouldn't have left. She stares up at the stage, marvels at the dancers.
JACK: Is this you flirting?
ALI: With someone wearing more eyeliner than me? He laughs. Points across the club to A DOOR leading Ask for Tess. She's your guy. Flirt As she heads off
JACK: Ask for Tess. She's your guy. Flirt As she heads off
ALI: Thanks, Jack.
ALI: Excuse me. I'm looking for Tess.
TESS: ( glued to the mirror ) So am I. And sometimes, when the lights are dim, and I squint my eyes .I can still see her. She switches to mascara. Sean, arms heavy with corsets, catches eyes with Ali, nods toward Tess: "that's her." Ali steps closer to Tess.
ALI: Hi. I'm a friend of Jack's, and I'm-
TESS: New in town.
ALI: Yes, and I'm
TESS: Looking for a job.
ALI: Yes, and I
TESS: Want to perform here.
ALI: Tess glances at Ali in the mirror. Then goes back to her mascara, unimpressed. Silence.
TESS: This is a dance show.
ALI: I can dance.
TESS: ( a quick glance ) Really? You a professional?
ALI: I'm a quick study.
TESS: Not on my dime. Tess stands, a final check in the mirror. Ali sees her chance
SLIPPING AWAY: Okay, I get that you're busy so I won't waste any more of your time but this place I've just never seen anything like it before and I know I belong here. So, how can I be a part of it?
ALI: Okay, I get that you're busy so I won't waste any more of your time but this place I've just never seen anything like it before and I know I belong here. So, how can I be a part of it?
TESS: Twenty bucks at the door can make all your dreams come true. Tess strides out, not looking back. Ali sees the Girls trading glances, amused. She turns and leaves.
ALI: One Dewar's neat, one shot of Patron, and get this, tough-guy in the hat? He wants a Cosmo. Jack looks at her, surprised. Impressed.
ALI: Her leg went behind her head!
JACK: Yeah, Coco's the real deal.
ALI: I want to do that.
JACK: She used to dance with the Joffrey Ballet. Nikki sang opera. Eva performed with Cirque. Everyone here's a pro. ( slides a tray of drinks ) And you're on!
BACKSTAGE,: Nikki, lined up with the other girls, peers between the curtains, spots Ali serving the drinks to a table.
NIKKI: What's she doing here?!
SEAN: What'd she do to you?
NIKKI: She thought I was a drag queen! Stifled giggles from the girls.
SEAN: Can't be the first time THAT'S Nikki is about to haul off on Sean when the CURTAIN OPENS, and WHOOMP!
ALI: When he kisses me I get a thrill. The Cat MEOWS and slinks out from behind the bed. Ali pulls the crystal beads out of her pocket
ALI: She heads back to the bar. As Jack loads her tray up, she stuffs her tips into her pocket SEES Sean, looking her up and down.
SEAN: Okay, girl, time for Sean to give you a real tip. He ties her shirt up higher, undoes the top few buttons.
MARCUS: Dewar's on the rocks for me. Bottle of Dom for the table and ( tosses a black AmEx on her tray, noticing her ) And tell Nikki I'm here. Ali starts away, then
ALI: And you are?
MARCUS: ( nods toward the card ) A member since 1991. Oh-kay. He smiles, wickedly handsome. Ali pivots and heads back to the bar. Before she can tell Jack the order:
JACK: Dewar's rocks, bottle of Dom, keep it coming.
ALI: So Asshole's a regular?
JACK: Marcus Gerber. Real estate guy.
ALI: He's with Nikki?
JACK: This week. Vince goes over to Marcus's table, shakes hands, joins him.
ALI: Who's that with him?
JACK: Technically your boss: Vince Scali. Tess's partner. And ex. Jack is about to lift the AmEx off the tray, when Sean swoops by and intercepts it.
SEAN: A black AmEx! The backstage pass to He sees Coco walking by, swipes the AmEx in her cleavage. She shudders, then turns around and tips her ass up at him. He swipes the card again.
COCO: Access denied!
SEAN: Now there's a first! Jack sees Ali laughing at their banter. She heads off with the tray of Dewar's and Dom as the "Prince Nez" number ends.
ON STAGE: LIGHTS UP on TESS, CENTER STAGE as she begins a new number, "Long John Blues." A singing/spoken hilarious interlude. The Girls back her up.
TESS: I GOT A DENTIST, HE'S OVER SEVEN FEET TALL. HIS NAME IS DR. LONG JOHN, AND HE ANSWERS EVERY CALL. I WENT TO LONG JOHN'S OFFICE, I SAID, "DOCTOR, THE PAIN IS KILLIN' ME." HE SAID, DON'T WORRY BABY, IT'S JUST YOUR CAVITY, NEEDS A LITTLE FILLIN'.. . As she continues. ON THE FLOOR, Nikki is sitting in Marcus's lap, nibbling his neck. Vince sits down beside Marcus. Marcus pats Nikki on the butt, excusing her. As she heads off:
VINCE: She's on the verge.
MARCUS: That's what you said last time.
VINCE: She has no choice. We owe a balloon payment of 100 grand on the first, she took out a second to buy me out of the condo. And she just got turned down for another loan today.
MARCUS: There's a handful of these clubs around town, I could buy one of them tomorrow.
VINCE: But it wouldn't be in the heart of the Sunset Strip.
TESS: .HE TOOK OUT HIS TRUSTY DRILL, TOLD ME TO OPEN WIDE. HE SAID HE WOULDN'T HURT ME, THEN HE FILLED MY HOLE INSIDE. LONG JOHN, DON ' T YOU EVER GO AWAY. CAUSE YOU THRILL ME WHEN YOU DRILL ME, AND I DON'T NEED NO NOVOCAINE TODAY. HE SAID IF IT EVER STARTS A'THROBBIN', COME BACK AND SEE OL' LONG JOHN, AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN AND AGAIN:1: A RIM-SHOT and BLAST from the band as the audience laughs. From the stage, Tess notices Vince shake Marcus's hand and leave. A flicker of irritation nothing anyone in the audience would notice but it's there.
ALI: She's funny.
SEAN: Thanks. My lines. Our secret. Jack gives Sean his drink. He walks off. MUSIC UP: An insanely cool version of Sly and Family Stone "Everybody Is A Star" mashed up with a Fosse-esque Burlesque rap.
BURLESQUE GIRLS: ( WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE ). Song CONTINUES over a SERIES OF SHOTS: IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali plops down a bunch of BOOKS, OPENS The Golden Age of Burlesque", lays on her bed, petting her cat with her foot. She locks in on a photo of 20's-era Burlesque dancers over which we HEAR
BURLESQUE GIRLS: ( WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE ) ALI CHANNELING THE CHOREOGRAPHY AS SHE: - wipes down tables with Jack in the club after hours, - flips through old Soul records at a used LP store, - pokes her way through the scruffy street folks that hang out by her hotel.
AERIAL MOVE: BURLESQUE GIRLS ( CONT'D ) ( WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE ) IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali, in the bath, still reading, turns the page to a gorgeous image of Josephine Baker
BURLESQUE GIRLS: ( WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE ) IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali thwacks down on an old mustard- colored chair.
ALI: EVERYBODY IS A STAR:::: SLAM CUT TO FIND Ali, in her waitress outfit, watching the girls on stage, lost in her fantasy. She catches herself, then moves along serving drinks while the Girls work the stage. The Burlesque Girls continue their Burlesque Rap. When the girls thrust out their hips in unison, Ali does too, unconsciously dancing along with them. AT THE BAR, Jack notices. Watches. Tries to focus on pouring drinks, but his eyes keep drifting to Ali's hips. NEARBY, Sean notices Jack noticing. Looks from Jack to Ali. Eyebrow goes up. Interesting.
TESS: Nikki, do you even own a watch? Or do you measure time in Patron Ali enters with a tray of drinks. Nikki swipes one.
ALI: Hey, no, that's for Nikki opens a bottle, pops 3 pills in her mouth, washes them down with the drink, and sets the empty glass on Ali's tray.
TESS: Fast-forward, babe. I gotta rebuild Rome in the next two minutes
ALI: Now see that's what I've been thinking about. There's one thing I don't get.
TESS: Just one?
ALI: It's the vocals. You have the girls lip-synching. which is fine, I guess, but wouldn't it be so much better if they actually sang? The Girls trade looks, knowing Ali's overstepping here. Ali doesn't feel the vibe-shift, surges ahead.
SEAN: Oh, no she didn't? Tess slowly spins around in her chair to face Ali. Peers at her with a supercilious gaze.
TESS: "When burlesque started"? Which ( searching her memory ) Oh. Well. this book said it came Vaudeville is the word you're looking for. Derived from the 15th- century French expression "voix de ville" "voice of the city". Popular songs of the time that were strung together into stage shows. Which, over time, gave birth to another kind of show in which talented girls showing a bit more skin danced, did skits, and, _ yes, sang. In addition to being raunchier, these shows were funnier, hence the new name. "Burlesque": "comical" in French. Ali sees the Girls enjoying this dressing-down immensely. Tess stands, peers down her nose at Ali.

ALI: Oh. Ok. It's just It's just that .I CAN sing and
TESS: We can all sing. But they don't come to hear us sing. They come to see the best dancers in town backed by the greatest singers in history. ( then, condescending ) But tell you what: when you find someone with better pipes than Sarah Vaughn, Billie Holiday and Etta James you let me know. She sashays out leaving Ali standing there with what's left of her dignity and an empty cocktail tray. The Girls launch back into prepping for the show.
ALI: Georgia? You okay in there? A FLUSH. The stall door opens. Georgia comes out shakily with mascara-smudged eyes, sweet as ever.
GEORGIA: I don't know why they call it morning sickness when it hits at every freakin hour of the day. She rinses her mouth out at the sink.
ALI: There aren't many women who could dance the Charleston on a chair at - - what are you, three months? Georgia turns sideways to the mirror, inspecting her bump.
GEORGIA: Four. Can you believe my boyfriend hasn't noticed yet?
ALI: You haven't told him?
GEORGIA: I guess as long as he doesn't know, I can still imagine he'll be happy about it. ( looks in the mirror ) Oh my God, look what the cat dragged in. She gets to work wiping away her smudged mascara.
ALI: You look pretty hot to me. Georgia reaches into her corset, yanks one breast skyward, then does the same to the other.
GEORGIA: Yeah, well you take what Mother Nature gave you and milk the hell out of it, right? Coco enters carrying a glass of tonic for Georgia.
COCO: ( TO ALI )
ALI: I had to pee. Is that okay with Not when you're blocking my mirror it's not. Ali sees she's in the way. As she steps aside:
COCO: Not when you're blocking my mirror it's not. Ali sees she's in the way. As she steps aside:
GEORGIA: I can't make any promises. Coco drags her out, leaving Ali alone. Ali looks at herself in the mirror. Reaches into her shirt and does the boob-hoist that Georgia did. Looks again. Better.
ALI: They tear past her. She shakes her head, reaches her landing, heads down the hall toward her room, then sees: HER HOTEL ROOM DOOR, ajar. The lock broken.
ALI: No!!! God damn it!!! She looks out the window, SEES the ROBBERS running off, disappearing down the street. She kicks the trash can. It flies across the room.
JACK: Ali? What's wrong? You okay? She tries to speak, but can't so she just nods.
THAT: I WAS
ALI: I WAS
I WAS: And as she expected, as soon as she talks, she starts to cry.
JACK: Shit. No way!
ALI: ( halting, gaspy sobs ) Came in busted the lock and stole all my MO-NEY-EY-EY-EY!!! She sobstrying to talk, with high-pitched SQUEAKS only heard by birds. Jack winces, trying to follow
JACK: Okay. I have no idea what you just said, but come on in here and we'll get it sorted out. She looks at him. Wiping her tears. He picks up the heaviest of her bags and leads her to:
JACK: Have a seat. I'll get us BOTH a drink. Here He hands her his phone. She looks at it.
ALI: I can't.
JACK: Sure you can. Go ahead. Her chin starts quivering all over again.
ALI: I.. .don't .have anyone.
JACK: What do you mean?
ALI: To call.
JACK: No parents? ( she shakes her head ) Siblings? Aunts? Uncles?
ALI: ( THROUGH TEARS )
JACK: ( REALIZING )
ALI: Just for one night, I swear. Just till it's light outside and I can figure out my next move.
JACK: Then she opens her small bag and the cat strolls out.
ALI: What? You don't like cats? It slinks around his leg. He shakes it off.
JACK: I hate cats.
ALI: How can you hate a cat?
JACK: It's easy, I'll show you. The cat bolts into the bedroom.
ALI: He goes outside. We just have to open a window. He's very She opens the window. The cat scurries back in, leaps onto the ledge. Ali pets him. Looks at Jack, smiles.
JACK: One night?
ALI: One night.
ALI: You're good.
JACK: Why don't you play at the club?
ALI: Why don't you play at the club?
JACK: Make more money bartending.
ALI: You in a band?
JACK: Was. Guitarist moved to Reno, Drummer went to med school, bassist is in rehab. I'm subbing around town till I regroup. This is for a punk fusion band their keyboardist is a flake, so they call me a lot.
ALI: ( SARCASTIC )
JACK: Why'd you leave Iowa?
ALI: Cause I looked around and realized there wasn't one person whose life I wanted.
JACK: A beat. Then as he starts playing again:
ALI: Hey Jack? He stops again.
JACK: Get some sleep.
JACK: He hurls the cat away and bolts out of bed, disgusted.
ALI: Morning. Coffee?
JACK: ( NODS )
ALI: She's pretty. Your sister?
JACK: My fiancee. Natalie.
ALI: Fiancee? You're straight?
JACK: Of course I'm straight. You thought I was gay?
ALI: I don't know, the.make-up?
JACK: I don't know, the.make-up?
ALI: I don't know, the.make-up?
JACK: It's a look.
ALI: A straight look.
JACK: A straight look.
ALI: ( THEN )
ALI: I should put on pants.
JACK: She bolts out to the living room, starts digging through her bag, bent over. She's in the doorway, so from the kitchen, all he can see is her cute little ass sticking out.
ALI: Where is she?
JACK: New York. Doing a play.
ALI: For how long?
JACK: Six more weeks. She can't find pants. She shifts, so now her ass is facing him directly. He tries not to look
ALI: ( KEEPS DIGGING )
I'M SORRY: For what?
JACK: For what?
ALI: I don't know. Now that you're straight and engaged, it feels weird that I came here.
JACK: Well, you did, and it was fine. Aha! Pants. She pulls them out, starts putting them on. He looks out. Her foot is caught in the pants leg. As she hops around, trying to untangle it
ALI: Alrighty then I'll get outta your hair now.
JACK: Wait, where're you headed?
ALI: Oh, don't worry about me. I've got a plan. ( scoops up the cat ) Come on, cat. She zips the cat into the bag he came in.
JACK: Hang on, let me at least spot you some cash. I'm a little strapped, but I could
ALI: No, I'm good, if you could just She nods at the door. He opens it for her.
JACK: She leaves. He closes the door behind her. Stands there.
JACK: So, this plan of yours?
ALI: .was to sit here at the bus stop and come up with a plan.
JACK: Come back inside.
ALI: No, Jack, I
JACK: I'll figure it out, this is not
ALI: I'll figure it out, this is not
ALI: I'll figure it out, this is not
YOUR PROBLEM: It's pouring!
JACK: It's pouring!
ALI: It's only water for chrissakes
JACK: GOD DAMN IT! GET YOUR ASS BACK IN MY HOUSE! NOW! Jack you've done enough and In ONE MOVE he SCOOPS HER up as she lets out a WHOOOOP!
ALI: Jack you've done enough and In ONE MOVE he SCOOPS HER up as she lets out a WHOOOOP!
ALI: PLEASE PUT ME DOWN He sets her down
JACK: Look, you have nowhere to go, I have a couch. You may as well stay here for a few days.
ALI: You really don't need to do that. I'll be fine
JACK: You'll be homeless. You always have this much trouble saying yes when someone is trying to help you?
AL I: It's never happened before. The Cat jumps up on the back of a chair, all wet, and SHAKES, splattering them with wet cat smell.
JACK: There's a towel in the bathroom dry yourself and that damn cat off.
JACK: ( INTO PHONE )
TESS: Okay, front row, thank you very They walk off stage, dismissed. Tess turns to Sean.
SEAN: They're busy "Dancing with the ( to the waiting dancers ) Last group, please. HALF A DOZEN DANCERS move to the stage. Ali watches from behind the bar, thinking. Then, on her face, we see: an idea ON THE FLOOR, Tess and Sean check their clipboards, organizing for this next set. They look up and start in:
TESS: All right, ladies, and five, six, seven whoa. There, in the back row, is Ali, in her white platform shoes.
ALI: Trying out.
TESS: I don't think so.
ALI: Tess, I've been singing and dancing my whole life and
TESS: The girls here have years of training and experience. This stage is for serious and professional
DANCERS WHO: ( angry, interrupting ) Hey_. This is your club and you can be as rude as you wantbut don't you dare tell me I'm not serious. Sean's eyebrows reach for the ceiling as Nikki enters, SEES Ali on stage.
ALI: ( angry, interrupting ) Hey_. This is your club and you can be as rude as you wantbut don't you dare tell me I'm not serious. Sean's eyebrows reach for the ceiling as Nikki enters, SEES Ali on stage.
AGAIN: ( DOUBTFUL )
TESS: ( DOUBTFUL )
ALI: Which one do you wanna see? Tess looks at her in disbelief.
TESS: Tough Lover! Tess plops down in a booth crosses her arms indignantly. ON STAGE, the music starts. Ali readies herself, starts to dance. Behind a beat to two. She's got the steps right, but it isn't clicking. She's thinking too hard. No personality. After a few measures, Tess has seen enough.
ALI: Hang on. ( to Dave in the booth ) Start it again, please? As Dave resets the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down and shakes it loose. Nikki ENTERS, SEES Ali on stage
NIKKI: ( TO GEORGIA )
COCO: On stage, Ali takes a beat; inhales, breathing in attitude. Then she looks up at the booth again.
ALI: The MUSIC starts in again. And this time, Ali comes alive. She may not have perfect technique or the best extension, but she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from her before. It's like she becomes a woman before our eyes. She misses a step or two, but who the hell cares? On the floor, Sean gapes, eyes popping. Tess is poker-faced. Coco and Georgia's expressions turn from dubious to respectful. Nikki's eyes narrow. At the bar, Jack freezes, a huge rack of glasses in his arms - - unable to tear his eyes away.
NIKKI: What are so you happy about, that's your replacement.
GEORGIA: Yeah, but she's really good. Tess and Ali are in a stare down.
TESS: I want so badly to say something bitchy, but nothing's coming.
SEAN: There's a first. Tess sighs, not wanting to give Ali any props.
TESS: You were off the whole second half.
ALI: So, I was spot on the first half? Tess narrows her eyes at Ali. Then looks over at Nikki, Coco and Georgia. Georgia gives an effusive THUMBS UP then suddenly becomes overcome by nausea, covers her mouth and RUNS to the bathroom to puke Tess rolls her eyes, looks back at Ali.
TESS: Oh, you're gonna be such a pain in my ass. Ali tries hard not to beam
ALI: Do I have the job, or not?
TESS: You're not great. What you are is lucky. Because I need someone And I know all the routines. As Tess turns and leaves
ALI: And I know all the routines. As Tess turns and leaves
TESS: Even in those shoes that time Theeeere's bitchy. Nikki watches Tess go turns and pours herself a shot.
SEAN: Theeeere's bitchy. Nikki watches Tess go turns and pours herself a shot.
NIKKI: Well this totally sucks ass. Sean jumps up on the stage.
SEAN: Congratulations. The last time someone showed Tess balls like that, she married him. ( looks Ali over ) You look like a checker at a Mal Wart in Wichita. Just tripled your salary. Get a new look.
ALI: Hey, I happen to like the way I Really? That's a fascinating story. And then what happens?
SEAN: Really? That's a fascinating story. And then what happens?
ALI: Sorry for the short notice, I quit! ( plants a big kiss on him ) But hey with my raise I'll be off your couch in a week. She squeezes him tight then heads backstage leaving him standing there, really turned on.
SEAN: First number, second number, third She catches the clothes. He dumps shoes on top of them, holding them up as he tells her what they go with:
SEAN: Admit it. You like her. It kills you, but you like her. Tess meets his eye, then walks away. The number ends. The girls rush offstage and peel their costumes off.
ALI: My tits are up around my ears, my thong's about a mile up up ass, this corset is so tight, I haven't breathed since Tuesday and these lashes are thick enough to kick up a stiff wind.
SEAN: It's fun being a girl, huh?
ALI: ( BIG SMILE )
JESSE: I'm starving, who wants to go grab some pizza before the next show? A general chorus of "Yeah?" and "I'm in." FOLLOW Ali to the bathroom as she throws on her clothes and washes off her make-up, humming "Rich Man's Frug" to herself. She heads back out to the dressing room to find: EVERYONE IS GONE. She looks around. Feels like an fool. She plunks down in a chair. Drops her bag on the floor. Looks at herself in the mirror.
ALI: Make-up is like wine. The good stuff costs a fortune but is worth every penny. Where is everyone?
TESS: Make-up is like wine. The good stuff costs a fortune but is worth every penny. Where is everyone?
ALI: All the girls went out for pizza.
TESS: Aren't you one of the girls?
ALI: Apparently not. Tess reads her like a book. Knows what went down. She turns to leave, then pauses at the door. Turns back.
TESS: Don't take it personally. Their love's the kind you gotta earn. Ali meets her eyes in the mirror. Then Tess grabs a brush from her own station, tosses it to Ali.
JACK: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Ali is just waking up.
ALI!!!: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Ali is just waking up.
JACK: Your stupid cat peed in the tub!
ALI: ( sees the window closed ) You closed the window, what do you Your cat pees in the house, and it's my_ fault?! Ali scoops the cat up.
JACK: Your cat pees in the house, and it's my_ fault?! Ali scoops the cat up.
ALI: Awwww. Poor guy, you must have been Goddamn cat. And you used my towel ( then, pointed ) How's that apartment hunting He GRABS the newspaper and tosses it in front of her she glares at him, then glances at the paper
JACK: Goddamn cat. And you used my towel ( then, pointed ) How's that apartment hunting He GRABS the newspaper and tosses it in front of her she glares at him, then glances at the paper
ALI: ( EYES WIDENING )
JACK: Can you really put a price on privacy? Freedom? Your own bathroom? With clean towels?
ALI: Okay, Jack I get it His cell phone rings. As he checks who's calling:
JACK: ( then, into phone: ) Hey, baby, how are you? He heads into the bedroom, closes the door. Ali shakes her head, begins to peruse the classifieds.
ALI: Guest studio, Hollywood, $900, with a yard, and oh. No pets. ( to the cat ) Screw them. She scans the ads some more. Finds a good one.
JACK: Go to Hell, turn left, it's three miles down on the right.
ALI: Really. How's Beachwood Canyon?
JACK: Great, if you have a car.
ALI: What about the "God damn" cat?
JACK: Hey, I don't like the cat. And I don't like my towel being wet. I don't like the lack of privacy. But you're in a jam and I'm the kind of guy, if a friend's in trouble, I help. It's just who I am.
ALI: ( SUSPICIOUS )
JACK: Nothing, you know just. hi. She narrows her eyes at him. He concedes.
ALI: So if you could stick around and chip in, it would
JACK: So if you could stick around and chip in, it would
ALI: Save your ass?
JACK: Ali looks down at his shoes.
ALI: Well, will you look at that? The shoe, on the other foot!
JACK: One minute I'm a freeloader with a God damn cat, the next, I'm the only thing standing between you and
OKAY: One minute I'm a freeloader with a God damn cat, the next, I'm the only thing standing between you and
ALI: One minute I'm a freeloader with a God damn cat, the next, I'm the only thing standing between you and
EVICTION: Just yes or no?
JACK: Just yes or no?
ALI: What's the proposal, exactly? Jack looks at her realizes he's screwed.
JACK: The bedroom, with private bathroom access, for 600 a month, including Half . Ali picks up the paper, reads an ad.
ALI: Half . Ali picks up the paper, reads an ad.
JACK: Half . Ali picks up the paper, reads an ad.
ALI: Ooh, look! Hot tub!
JACK: Fine. The closet, too. She weighs it. Makes him suffer. Then:
ALI: Thank you.
JACK: Thank you.
ALI: ( MOCKING HIM )
TESS: But you can bet your sweet ass I'm better ONCE than I ever was. The crowd laughs. Tess points to a woman who isn't laughing.
SEAN: The distributor's holding back the booze unless we cut him a check.
TESS: Ply him with drinks, send Scarlett over to flirt, and try to finagle him down to a half.
SEAN: How's a third? He produces a check, all filled-out, for her to sign.
TESS: Have I told you lately that I love Got any brothers?
SEAN: Got any brothers?
TESS: Drinking already?
NIKKI: Yes, Mommie.
TESS: You're drunk.
NIKKI: No. But I'm working on it. Nikki totters a little. Tess looks her over.
TESS: I'm pulling you from this number. Go home, wring yourself out, and come back tomorrow.
NIKKI: You can't pull me Tess SPOTS Ali heading for the dressing room
TESS: Ali! Take Nikki's spot.
NIKKI: WHAT?! That bitch can't dance my Ali get dressed NOW! Ali looks at Nikki who GLARES at her
TESS: Ali get dressed NOW! Ali looks at Nikki who GLARES at her
ALI: But, wait Tess that's always been Nikki's number. Tess looks at her she's really had it with these girls
TESS: But this is MY club, and now it's your number. Ali looks between the two of them, Nikki glaring at her
THE STAGE: Ali and the other dancers hit the stage and start in on the vampy "TOUGH LOVER." AT THE BAR, Jack is busy mixing drinks. He glances at the stage, then DOUBLE-TAKES on Ali, looking crazy gorgeous. She vamps forward with the girls, they rotate singing into the prop mic.
JESSE: ( LIP-SYNCHING ) ( LIP-SYNCHING ) ( LIP-SYNCHING )
SO_: ( LIP-SYNCHING ) ( LIP-SYNCHING )
COCO: ( LIP-SYNCHING ) ( LIP-SYNCHING )

DAVE: Shit, okay He checks his sound board then bolts from the room. Nikki watches him go LOOKS DOWN onto the STAGE as ALI STEPS to
THE MIC: ( LIP-SYNCHING )
ALI: ( LIP-SYNCHING )
DAVE: You wanted to see me? ON STAGE Ali looks at flustered Tess.the girls.the audience. Panic. On the floor, Nikki watches with satisfaction as she makes her way over to Marcus. Enjoying the train wreck she caused. Then in a flash, Ali turns to the audience, and SINGS a'capella from the TOP OF THE SONG.
ALI: She looks around. Silence. Mouths agape. Tess approaches in
THE WINGS: ( to a stage hand ) Close the Goddman curtain!
TESS: ( to a stage hand ) Close the Goddman curtain!
SEAN: Hold on. Ali starts to sing again, her version, slow, and sexy.
ALI: WELL I WANT A LOVER TO MOVE ME SO, WHO SURE KNOWS HOW TO ROCK N Tess looks at Ali, you could knock her over with a feather. Sean looks at Tess. Scarlett looks at Coco. Jack stares at the stage. Everyone stunned by the sound coming out of this girl. And now the song really takes off! SUDDENLY, one of the BAND BOYS grabs his sax and plays. Ali jumps in, seamless, as the guys on Bass and Drums join in. Ali picks up the choreography. The girls fall in with her.
ALI: THE SEVEN SISTERS GOT NOTHING ON HIM, I 'M TALKING ABOUT A LOVER WHO ' S FAST AS THE WIND. EVER YONE ' LL TALK HOW HE'S GOT ME FIXED, IT AIN'T VOODOO IT'S JUST THAT TWIST.

The room ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE, knowing they caught a once-in-a- lifetime performance. Marcus stands, clapping, whistling. Ali basks in it, jubilant, rapturous. She glances to the wings and sees Sean, clapping and jumping in place. Then she sees Tess beside him, stone-faced.
ALI: Tess, when the music stopped
TESS DAVE: Why didn't you tell me you I have no idea what happened. could blow like that?
TESS: Do you boys know all the music?
TESS: Okay, then. Tomorrow night, Ali sings lead, everyone else is back- up. Questions? Ali can't keep from beaming as she shakes her head, no!
NIKKI: "People don't come to hear us No. But they'll come to hear her sing. Dry out and maybe you can back her up. She leaves. Nikki scowls. Sean grabs Ali.
TESS: No. But they'll come to hear her sing. Dry out and maybe you can back her up. She leaves. Nikki scowls. Sean grabs Ali.
SEAN: Bitch, you SANG that damn song! He heads off to the dressing room, too, leaving Nikki and Ali alone together. Their eyes meet.
NIKKI: One of us has clearly underestimated the other. She tosses her glass in the trash and leaves Ali alone.
MARCUS: Where'd you learn to sing like She turns. Marcus is there. Handsome, charming and devious as You can't learn to sing like that.
ALI: You can't learn to sing like that.
MARCUS: Well, you're too good to be singing I just got into the show and suddenly I'm too good for it? Shrugs, "but, you are" then
ALI: I just got into the show and suddenly I'm too good for it? Shrugs, "but, you are" then
MARCUS: How about a drink?
ALI: Sure. Jack's at the bar. Tell him I sent you. It's on me.
MARCUS: But I hate lines. AT THE BAR - Jack looks up, SEES Ali and Marcus talking. BACK ON MARCUS who looks Ali up and down.
ALI: Talk about a "line." She smiles, amused, and heads away from him, toward the bar. He watches her go. Tess intercepts Ali.
TESS: What did he want?
ALI: Directions to the bar. As Ali heads off. Tess glances back at Marcus, mistrustful.
JACK: You blew me away! Who knew you could sing like that?
COCO: Who knew any white chick could sing like that? You channeled that shit.
SEAN: How the hell do you do that, girl?
ALI: I don't know, I can't explain it. It's like I start singing, and something starts to move inside me. It's in my hands, my feet, my gut,
MY THIGHS: She runs her hands over her body as she describes it. Jack watches her holy smokes. Sean notices his gaze on her.
GEORGIA: Trust me, I know what that feels like. I have to pee. Again. She hops off the stool and scurries to the back. Coco stands, to leave. Looks at Ali.
COCO: Wanna grab something to eat? Ali looks back at Coco validated. Accepted. At last.
ALI: Yeah. Lemme get my bag. Ali moves off. Coco goes to get her coat. Sean sees Jack still watching Ali as she walks across the room.
SEAN: Well, will you look at that.
JACK: You looking at that girl the way I looked at you all those years. Only difference: you actually stand a chance with her.
SEAN: You looking at that girl the way I looked at you all those years. Only difference: you actually stand a chance with her.
JACK: I have a fiancee.
SEAN: Three thousand miles away.
JACK: We talk every day.
SEAN: Let me guess what about: her, her and.oh! Her. Jack shoots him a glare.
ALI: I was just explaining to Jack that even opportunity has a shelf life. Jack grabs a trash bag and takes it out back. Sean looks at Ali more closely. He brushes her hair out of her face. Then he holds it off her shoulders and raises that gay eyebrow. - INT. SALON - DAY - Ali sits in front of a mirror while Sean gives the HAIRDRESSER very specific instructions. - INT. JACK'S APARTMENT, AT HIS KEYBOARD, Jack plays a high- energy style piano which runs over a QUICK SEQUENCE: It's the instrumental music to: "BUT I'M A GOOD GIRL." - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - The Burlesque Girls dance on stage, performing a high-energy tap dance, coupled with a European slap-dance, with the slapping of each other's bodies and faces integrated with tapping and music. It's very cabaret, but modernized with contemporary STEPPING. CARRY MUSIC: - INT. SALON - LATER - The HAIRDRESSER spins the chair around. Ali's her hair is platinum blonde, with bangs and a Louise Brooks bob that frames her face beautifully. Her smoky eyes pop like never before. Ali studies herself:

JACK: ( FLUSTERED )
ALI: Jack. It's okay for you to think I look hot. We're friends for chrissakes. It's not like we're brother and sister.
JACK: ( TO HIMSELF )
NIKKI: Why the hell is everyone having a conniption over her? She's just a Ali sexy, sophisticated, gorgeous enters.
ALI: ( FAUX INNOCENT )
VINCE: Vince, if I were going to sell, I'd have sold to those idiots building that monstrosity across the street. I said no.
TESS: Vince, if I were going to sell, I'd have sold to those idiots building that monstrosity across the street. I said no.
TESS: Vince, if I were going to sell, I'd have sold to those idiots building that monstrosity across the street. I said no.
VINCE: Which made Marcus bump his offer up again. It's obscene, what he wants to give us. At least hear him out.
MARCUS: It's very simple. I buy you out and pay you a million off the top. ( motions to Vince ) Five hundred grand each. Tess looks up from the contract, squints at Marcus.
TESS: Why do you want this club so badly?
MARCUS: Best view on the Sunset Strip.
VINCE: Do you know what you could do with that money, Tess?
TESS: Do you know what you can do with that money, Vince?
VINCE: Be reasonable. We're rolling vendors ninety days out.
MARCUS: The club's not even worth what you paid for it. You've got a second mortgage, you can't get a third. Tess looks at Vince, betrayed.
TESS: Did you also tell him about the tattoo on my ass?
VINCE: It's business, Tess. Not personal.
TESS: My business. Which I built from the ground up.
MARCUS: You're not gonna get another opportunity like this.
TESS: She looks at a photo on her wall: the Burlesque Girls, in all their glory.
VINCE: Don't worry. The balloon payment's due on the first. She doesn't have the money. She has to sell. IN TESS'S OFFICE, Tess stands in the doorway, having heard. Then she walks back to her desk and sits, dejected. Head in her hands. For the first time ever, looking worried and defeated. Something she'd never show anyone. A beat. Then:
SEAN: Well. We've had a pretty good run. She looks up. Sean is in the doorway.
TESS: No. You cannot say that to me. I can eat these "sky is falling" dipshits for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but not YOU. You cannot be that person. I've scoured dirty flea markets for costumes, stayed up all night sewing till my fingers bled, painted and repainted every goddamn wall of this place myself.
SEAN: There she is. Thought I'd lost you for a minute. Tess just looks at him, and smiles. He grabs a boa, throws it around his neck and exits. When he's gone, Tess's smile IN THE CLUB, the place is empty. Jack is wiping down the bar cleaning up. He starts stacking some chairs in the house as..SEAN CROSSES the floor.
JACK: Sean EXITS as Jack carries a stack of chairs to the side of the room, sets them down near the piano. STOPS, grabs a chair for himself and sits down. Begins to play an original song. ACROSS THE ROOM, Ali ENTERS from backstage. Her dance bag over her shoulder. She HEARS the piano, peers around a column, SEES Jack playing. She stays in the shadows and watches as he sings and plays a beautiful song. ( TBD ) The song ends. Ali applauds slowly. Impressed. Jack looks up, surprised that she is there.
ALI: Beautiful. You write that?
JACK: Just some sentimental crap. Ready?
ALI: Jack zips back to the door, opens it quietly, then SLAMS it.
JACK: Hey! Just got home! Ali grabs a dress from her bed, slips into it.
ALI: In here! Can you zip me up? In a nanosecond Jack enters the bedroom.
JACK: Rehearsing. I'm playing a late show tonight. As he zips up the back of her dress, he sees the PHOTO propped against the lamp on the bedside table.
ALI: Me and my mom on my 7th birthday. She died just a few weeks later.
JACK: She was so young.
ALI: 24. There was so much she never got to do. Sometimes I feel like, if I make the most of my life, part of her will get to live a little more, too.
JACK: Wow. You must miss her. She puts the photo down. Turns back to him. They're close.
ALI: Every single day, something happens I want to tell her about.
JACK: What was today's? A beat. Their eyes connect.
ALI: Don't know. Hasn't happened yet. They stand there, close to each other. Jack sees a strand of hair caught in the earring. He pulls it away, freeing it. His fingers move through her hair. She closes her eyes, feeling his fingers against her neck. Then she opens her eyes, looks at him. He looks back, unable to look away. Until: His CELL PHONE RINGS. Breaking the mood. He pulls it from his pocket. Checks who's calling. Looks back at Ali.
JACK: I should. it's. Natalie. Ali steps away from him, disappointed. He answers the phone.
ALI: A GUY WHAT TAKES HIS TIME. PULL BACK to reveal she's on stage at the club with the BURLESQUE GIRLS. Finger waves and 1920's sexy clothes.
ALI: Hey when can you cut out? I'm about to fall asleep standing up.
JACK: I have that gig, remember? In fact, I gotta head out or I'm gonna be late. ( checking his watch ) I can maybe swing you home before.
ALI: No, that's okay, you go. I'll grab a ride with Coco. He grabs his jacket from under the bar. As he heads out:
JACK: By the way you killed.
ALI: ( looks at him, smiles ) He disappears out the back exit. Ali turns around and finds herself face to face with Marcus.
MARCUS: You ready?
ALI: For what?
MARCUS: I'll drop you off.
ALI: Excuse me?
MARCUS: Sorry I was coming to talk to you and caught the end of your ( putting on her coat reaching for her bags ) Talk to me about.?
ALI: ( putting on her coat reaching for her bags ) Talk to me about.?
MARCUS: Dinner. With me. Gimmie that. He swoops down and GRABS her dance bag and purse, turns and heads out.
ALI: Hey.! Come back here.!
ALI: Where are you taking me?
MARCUS: I told you to dinner.
ALI: Dinner? What about Nikki What's up with you and Nikki?
MARCUS: We're friends.
ALI: Where I'm from friends don't chew each other's earlobes.
MARCUS: Aren't you glad you left? ( then, remembering ) Oh, damn!
ALI: I just remembered I have to make a quick appearance at a party.
MARCUS: I just remembered I have to make a quick appearance at a party.
ALI: You just remembered.
MARCUS: It's on the way. We'll be quick. Ten minutes, tops. Do you mind?
ALI: And if I do.
MARCUS: Then you've been kidnapped. He turns off Sunset and heads up into the hills.
ALI: Wow. Nice house.
PARTY GUEST: Hey, Marcus
MARCUS: Hey, how you doing? He shakes the guy's hand and moves on through the party. Someone else calls out to him.
ANOTHER GUEST: Hey, let me get a drink, I'll be
MARCUS: Hey, let me get a drink, I'll be
BACK: Marcus pulls Ali in the opposite direction, avoiding another GROUP trying to greet him. He grabs two wine glasses off a tray, gives one to Ali, then pushes through a door into:
ALI: Marcus you can't just take that.
MARCUS: He hands her one tray, sticks a bottle of wine in one pocket, throws an opener in another.
SHHH: He hands her one tray, sticks a bottle of wine in one pocket, throws an opener in another.
ALI: They're gonna throw us out of here.
MARCUS: Not if we sneak out first, come on. He kicks open a back door.
MARCUS: Up there. He starts up some steps to an outdoor gazebo. Ali follows. They pass AN INCREDIBLY WELL-DRESSED COUPLE coming down.
GUY: Hey, Marcus
MARCUS: Hey, Guys. Greg, Marla, this is They exchange hellos. Ali notices:
ALI: Ooh. Killer shoes.
MARLA: Aren't they? Louboutins.
GREG: ( TO MARCUS )
MARCUS: Glad you could come. Ali stares at Marcus. He smiles, takes her hand, keeps leading her up the stairs.
AL I: You had to make an appearance at your own party?
MARCUS: Would've been rude not to, right? You'd like those guys. Greg's the entertainment editor at the Times, and Marla's a designer. Ali glances back at Marla again, locks in on her shoes.
AL I: I'm gonna dream about those shoes.
MARCUS: Thousand dollars a pop.
AL I: Jesus. Who can afford that?
MARCUS: I can.
ALI: Hey, I saw them first. He laughs as they reach the top of the stairs and a BREATHTAKING PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE ENTIRE CITY is revealed. Ali pauses, taking in the glittering, massive view of L.A.
MARCUS: It should. That view cost me three times what the house did.
ALI: You own that too?
MARCUS: No. I own everything above it.
ALI: There is nothing above it.
MARCUS: You own.air?
ALI: You own.air?
MARCUS: Air rights. The guy who owns the strip mall was having money issues and almost had to sell. Whoever he sold to would have put in a huge tower. So I bought the air rights. Now no one can ever build above one Aren't you the sly puss.
ALI: Aren't you the sly puss.
MARCUS: Mall guy gets to keep his property. I get to keep the second best view in L.A.
ALI: What's the first? He gazes at her. She rolls her eyes.
MARCUS: None who ever called me on it. He smiles. Looks at her. Then.
ALI: Because you're talented enough to get whatever you want. And I'm smart enough to help make it happen. So? What do you want? A beat. She thinks about it. Looks him in the eye.
MARCUS: Because you're talented enough to get whatever you want. And I'm smart enough to help make it happen. So? What do you want? A beat. She thinks about it. Looks him in the eye.
ALI: I want to be the best singer I can be. I want to give as much joy as I get when I perform. And I want to die knowing I made the most of every opportunity life gave me.
MARCUS: That's .so beautiful.
AL I: There wasn't a dry eye in the house when I said it at the Grundy County Junior Miss Talent Show. His eyes narrow.
MARCUS: Why do you women always take advantage of nice boys?
ALI: Oh, please. You are SO not a nice He clinks her glass. Smiles at her. Devilish and sexy.
ALI: Ooh, I love this song. The Piano Player scoots to make room. She sits beside him. He starts humming along. She does too. Then he sings a line. She sings one back. And they fall in together. Not vamping, not performing. Just feeling the beauty of the music in the middle of the night.
JACK: He looks in. Empty. He checks the clock: 4:45. He hears a "meow", and sees the cat. He picks it up, turns out the light, and leaves the room.
COCO: Someone has a package! Ali sees A GIFT BOX at her station. She reads the card: "You saw them first." She opens the box and sees the Louboutins.
JESSE: Ooh. Faboo. Nikki picks one up checking their authenticity.
NIKKI: Who's the sucker? All eyes turn to Ali. She's saved by Tess entering.
TESS: Coco-puff, shake a leg, you're on move, move, move Tess exits.
ALI: Ahh. My Nanna used to call me her Yet another fascinating story.
SEAN: Yet another fascinating story.
NIKKI: Why doesn't Tess have a nickname for me?
COCO: Oh, she does. A knowing look amongst the girls.
NIKKI: She never uses it.
SEAN: Sure she does.
NIKKI: Just after you leave the room. Nikki gives him the finger and walks out. A beat. Then:
SEAN: Just after you leave the room. Nikki gives him the finger and walks out. A beat. Then:

The Burlesque Girls and Sean all APPLAUD ( except Nikki ) Ali smiles. Embarrassed. She curtsies sarcastically. Coco points to a BOUQUET OF ROSES at Ali's station.
COCO: From Monsieur Louboutin, I presume. Ali reads the card: "To the best view in L.A. - M". Sean shoves her down in her seat, pulls her coat off.
SEAN: Shake your tail, Alicat, you still got a show to do.
MUSIC ): INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT Daredevils Missy and Kitten DeVille, in striped stockings, corsets, and tons of cleavage, swing on a trapeze over the audience. Playing the comedy, grabbing each other in all the right places. Classic Burlesque, unusually bawdy. Equally suggestive, funny, and skillful. Tess, all dolled-up, weaves through the tables, greeting, welcoming, reveling in the crowd. FIND Ali as she strides over to Marcus's booth. He stands, hands her a glass of champagne.
MARCUS: To the girl of the hour.
ALI: I'm starting to think you'll go to any length.
MARCUS: ( INNOCENTLY )
ALI: Well I appreciate the kudos. ( re: crowded room ) And Tess appreciates the business.
MARCUS: This has NOTHING to do with Tess. This is about you. And me.
ALI: You are so full of it. He laughs takes her arm
MARCUS: I've got another friend I want you to meet. She sees HAROLD SAINT sitting in the booth. He's in his 60's, still dressing like Robert Evans in his heyday.
ALI: ( SHOCKED )
HAROLD: Her, she chewed me up and spat me out, that one. But with her voice, I forgive her everything.
ALI: Thank you.
HAROLD: You ever recorded?
ALI: Not yet.
HAROLD: We should do something about that. He stands. Turns to Marcus.
ALI: Holy shit. Harold Saint. AT THE BAR, Jack watches Ali and Marcus talking excitedly. Not liking what he sees. Sean breezes by, grabs a drink.
SEAN: You snooze, you lose, pretty boy.
TESS: Can you believe this crowd? He dumps the costumes in her arms.
SEAN: 'bout time. These poor babies are begging for your glue-gun. Tess walks off with the armful of clothes, so happy, humming to herself, passes her OFFICE OPENS the door to SEE VINCE is sitting at her desk. He flinches at the sight of her-
TESS: Can you believe the crowd out there? Never thought I'd see- She stops in her tracks, spotting Vince's PANTS on the FLOOR, and a TRAIL OF WOMEN'S CLOTHES to. THE NEW COCKTAIL WAITRESS, peering out, half-dressed, from behind the curtains
NIKKI: Tess. We need to talk. Tess rolls her eyes, doesn't slow.
TESS: Not now, Nikki.
NIKKI: Yes, now. I've been here since the beginning. We built this club together. And then some girl shows up out of nowhere who hasn't even paid her dues
TESS: I'll get her to write a check And suddenly it's her show?
NIKKI: And suddenly it's her show?
TESS: No, it's not her show. It's my show. But people want to hear her sing. She's bringing them in off the streets. You better believe I'm building a show around her!
NIKKI: I can sing too! And you know it. But you don't give a shit. You always say this is a dance troupe, now suddenly it's not?
TESS: And you expect me to dance behind a girl who struts in with a new pair of shoes she got for sleeping with Marcus Gerber?
NIKKI: And you expect me to dance behind a girl who struts in with a new pair of shoes she got for sleeping with Marcus Gerber?
NIKKI: And you expect me to dance behind a girl who struts in with a new pair of shoes she got for sleeping with Marcus Gerber?
TESS: ( unlocking her car ) Nikki, you're wasted. Go home.
NIKKI: I won't be upstaged by some slut with mutant lungs! Tess hurls the costumes in the trunk of her car, furious.
TESS: So don't be! Leave! If you don't want to be a part of what's happening here, then I don't want you around.
NIKKI: ( AGHASST )
TESS: Since when do you care about friendship? Or this group? You're a trainwreck, Nikki! You put tequila on your breakfast cereal! I'm struggling to survive here, and you show up too drunk to dance! You call that loyalty? Nikki just looks at her
NIKKI: Okay, then. I quit! Nikki stomps off. Tess sighs
TESS: NIKKI WAIT ( MOCKING HER )
NIKKI WAIT: Marcus says you're losing the club "They don't come to hear us sing"
NIKKI: Marcus says you're losing the club "They don't come to hear us sing"
TESS: Night, Dave. Dave FLIPS a big lever, and almost all the lights go OUT, leaving one shaft of light across the stage. We HEAR Dave leave, as the street door closes shut. Tess alone on stage.
ALI: You really need to do that at 6 in the morning? He turns, sees her.
JACK: Little overdressed for breakfast.
ALI: My pajamas were in my bedroom. Which was occupied.
JACK: Well, you're never here so. it's stupid for me to crash on the couch every night when there's a perfectly good empty bed. Jack grinds the coffee beans again. Ali winces.
ALI: So you want the bedroom back? Is that what you're saying?
JACK: The bed should be used by someone.
ALI: Hey, I'm home every night. Maybe not when you think I should be, but last I checked, you were my roommate, not my mother.
JACK: You'll have to move all your shit.
ALI: You'll have to move all your shit.
JACK: You'll have to move all your shit.
ALI: I realize that.
JACK: Cause the room's a total mess
ALI: I'll move my stuff, God
JACK: Clothes, make-up, shoes, hair Jesus, Jack, what is your problem? Ever since I started hanging out with Marcus, you've been acting like a class-A prick. Is there something you want to say?
ALI: Jesus, Jack, what is your problem? Ever since I started hanging out with Marcus, you've been acting like a class-A prick. Is there something you want to say?
JACK: What? No. What do I care? You're ambitious, he can make things happen, go ahead, make a deal with the devil, what's it to me?
ALI: First of all: He's not the devil. He's a smart businessman. And oddly enough a gentleman.
JACK: And try not to kill the cat!
JACK: What do you mean, you're still in New York? .So you just decided not to come? You think you might've wanted to, I don't know, let me know??? We haven't seen each other in six months. ACROSS THE TERRACE, Ali sees Jack yelling into his phone. Sean sees her watching.
SEAN: Oh, please, that girl? Show up at a party where she's not the center of attention? AT THE BAR - LATER - Jack drains one drink and orders another, getting very drunk. Ali sidles up to the bar.
ALI: ( TO BARTENDER )
JACK: ( BOOZEY )
ALI: Hey what're we, in junior high?
JACK: You still mad at me, Iowa? C'mon. Bring it on. She starts to say something as THE SHIRELLES start to sing "BABY IT'S YOU" Jack turns to the DJ, points both fingers at him and YELLS:
ALI: Well, you're quite the crooner. He looks her in the eye.
JACK: I'm sorry for being a class A And as of about. ( bleary look at his watch,
ALI: You and Natalie split up?
JACK: That we did. So. That explains what I'm doing here all alone. What are you doing here all alone?
ALI: Do I look alone to you? They share a look. Then he spins her around in his arms. She AT THE BAR, tipsy Sean and Coco stand side-by-side. Coco is watching the DJ spin. The DJ glances down at them.
COCO: That DJ's hot.
SEAN: You think?
COCO: He keeps looking at me. Coco smiles up at him, flirty. The DJ smiles back.

JACK: ( trying to be serious ) The dog, or Nanna? Ali bursts out laughing. So does Jack, as he pushes the door open, and they fall into the apartment.
ALI: Help me. Jack gets the lamp to standing, then grabs one of Ali's boots, slides it off, dumps it. Then he tries the second it sticks he pulls harder the boot pops off and he careens backwards, crashing into the lamp, knocking it over again. Ali cracks up. He turns to the lamp.
JACK: ( like to a dog ) He turns back to Ali, regains composure, bows
ALI: Oh. Okay.
JACK: A gift from my mother. Never worn Go figure. Jack walks past Ali, toward the door.
ALI: Go figure. Jack walks past Ali, toward the door.
JACK: Forgot to lock up.
ALI: Night again. He walks back into the bedroom and once gain shuts the door. Ali smiles to herself, plumps her pillow. The door flies open again Jack's there in just the pants, no top.

ALI: I've had a lot to drink. And my judgment is off. He touches her face, their chemistry palpable.
MARCUS: Hey, I'm a gentleman. Which means I'd never kiss a lady when she's. She looks at him.
ALI: She leans in and impulsively pulls him into a kiss.
ALI: Where am I? She sees a Warhol-esque PRINT OF MARCUS on the wall. She raises her brows then sees her disheveled reflection in a huge mirror: smeared mascara, hair askew.
MARCUS: He comes up behind her, nuzzles her neck.
ALI: What is this?
MARCUS: Now it's a model. But when it grows up, it'll be a mixed-use space: retail and residential.
ALI: This is the address of the Burlesque Lounge. Marcus shrugs, dries his hair.
MARCUS: Best view on the Sunset Strip, with no windows. When I'm done with it, it'll have a thousand.
ALI: You can't tear down the club.
MARCUS: Actually, I can.
ALI: But what about the history? That place is a landmark.
MARCUS: Not according to the city.
ALI: Does Tess know about this?
MARCUS: What Tess knows and doesn't know isn't a big concern of mine.

ALI: Where'd you get this?
SEAN: Jack. He dropped it off on his way to the airport.
ALI: Where's he going?
SEAN: New York on the red-eye.
ALI: To be with Natalie?
SEAN: Pedal faster, baby, he and Natalie are over. You're the one he's been looking high and low for.

ALI: I HAVE TO GET TO GATE 43! There's Gate 43, right over there.
SECURITY GUY: There's Gate 43, right over there.
ALI: JACK! JACK! JACK! ALL HEADS TURN to look at her, except Jack, who can't hear. A PLUMP WOMAN in front of him looks at Ali. Ali points to Jack. The woman taps Jack and points. He looks to see: They are separated by several feet of security ropes.
JACK: What are you doing here?
ALI: Sean told me you're going to New York. Please don't go!
JACK: I have to. I got an offer from that band the Punk Fusion group. They want me to tour with them.
ALI: They finally had it with the flaky keyboardist. I'll be back in five weeks. Will you be here?
JACK: They finally had it with the flaky keyboardist. I'll be back in five weeks. Will you be here?
ALI: Yes! Yes. Absolutely.
JACK: What about Marcus?
ALI: .Marcus who? They share a smile, separated by the ropes.
JACK: I'm trying to figure out if I should kiss you now, or make you wait five weeks.
ALI: Five weeks?! That's forever!
JACK: I gotta go, that's me. He picks up his bags. It's killing Ali.
JACK: But then I'll miss my flight!
JACK: She turns. Jack is there. In one fantastically romantic move, he pulls her into his arms, kisses her deeply an epic kiss that makes passersby stop and stare.
ALI!: She turns. Jack is there. In one fantastically romantic move, he pulls her into his arms, kisses her deeply an epic kiss that makes passersby stop and stare.
ALI: Well, go get 'em, Jack. He smiles, then disappears into the crowd. Ali stands there, watching him, gobsmacked by the kiss.
TESS: Smoother than honey and twice as sweet. Each girl lovelier then the next. Gentlemen, hold onto your hats. Ladies, hold on to your gentlemen. We may not have windows.. .but we DO have. ( motions to the girls ) .the best view on the Sunset The audience hoots as the Burlesque Girls ENTER the stage dancing. ( SONG TBD ) ON ALI a lightbulb going on! As Tess exits the stage, Ali pushes through the crowd and races backstage.
ALI: You could knock this is still my officeat least for another 48
TESS: You could knock this is still my officeat least for another 48
HOURS: But this is really, really Tess holds up a hand.
ALI: But this is really, really Tess holds up a hand.
TESS: Not. Now.
ALI: I said NOT
BUT: I said NOT
TESS: I said NOT
ALI: Yes now! God damn, you are one stubborn mule of a woman. Anyone else in their right mind would have figured out by now, when I have something to tell you, you listen! I told you I could dance, did you listen? No. Big mistake. I told you I could sing, did you listen? No. Big. mistake. This time you are going to hear what I have to say if I have to tie you up with your corset strings and scream it in your God damn ear. For the first time someone silences Tess. Ali takes a breath.
BUSINESSMAN: ( INTO PHONE )
TESS: You offered to buy my club a few years back. I said no.
BUSINESSMAN: And now you've changed your mind.
TESS: Not exactly. Tess smiles at him. Looks at Ali, who's not smiling. She elbows her. Ali starts smiling. Tess walks up to the desk and sits herself down. Ali does the same.
BUSINESSMAN: I'm confused.
TESS: Go with me, there's a good ending, I promise. How much will these condos you're building sell for?
BUSINESSMAN: They start at one million and go up, depending on the view.
TESS: What if I told you a twenty-story high-rise was going up where my club is?
ALI: Ten stories would. Twenty would decimate them. Leaving behind a lot of angry homeowners staring across the street at fluorescent light bulbs and dirty windows.
TESS: So. Mr. ?
BUSINESSMAN: Mr. Anderson. Your pretty million- dollar ocean views are going away because I'm selling my building to a developer tomorrow who'll have his twenty stories all framed up by the time you start selling
TESS: Mr. Anderson. Your pretty million- dollar ocean views are going away because I'm selling my building to a developer tomorrow who'll have his twenty stories all framed up by the time you start selling
ALI: Trying to sell
TESS: Trying to sell these condos.
BUSINESSMAN: I'm listening.
TESS: As am I. As long as you're telling me you'll have a check to me by 5:00 today.
COCKTAIL WAITRESS: Sorry, baby, they cut you off at the bar. Said you have to pay cash.
VINCE: What? I co-own this goddamn place
TESS: Not anymore you don't. I'm buying you out.
VINCE: You can't do that.
TESS: Actually, according to page 4 of our contract, I can.
VINCE: ( SCOFFING )
TESS: Why postpone joy? She hands him a CASHIER'S CHECK. Vince stares at it.
VINCE: What the hell is this?
TESS: I realize it's been a while since you've seen one, but it's called a He stares at it, stunned.Then at her.
VINCE: Where'd you get this?
TESS: Not your business anymore. And neither is the lounge.
ALI: How'd that feel?
TESS: Not half bad.
ALI: And to think, you didn't even want me around.
TESS: Oh, Jesus, here it comes.
ALI: .What was it you said to me that first night? "Twenty bucks at the door will make all your dreams come true." That was sweet of you.
TESS: Are you finished?
ALI: ( loving needling her ) Kinda ironic, when you think about it. I started off begging you to make my dreams come true, and here we are
TESS: All right already! You want me to say it, I'll say it. She looks at her.
NIKKI: ( SHEEPISH )
TESS: Again, and I wanna come home
NIKKI: Again, and I wanna come home
TESS: Yes, again! Did you fill my spot or What do you think? Tess and Nikki share a look.
AGAIN: Yes, again! Did you fill my spot or What do you think? Tess and Nikki share a look.
NIKKI: Yes, again! Did you fill my spot or What do you think? Tess and Nikki share a look.
TESS: What do you think? Tess and Nikki share a look.
BACKSTAGE: Ali looks at Tess quizzically
ALI: Just like that?
TESS: If I had a dollar for every time she's quit.
ALI: We all fight. Bitch. Love and hate. And then make up. Just like I never had a sister.
TESS: We all fight. Bitch. Love and hate. And then make up. Just like I never had a sister.
ALI: I never had a sister.
TESS: Me neither. THANK GOD.
