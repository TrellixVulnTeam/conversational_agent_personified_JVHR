BATMAN 2: Screenplay By Sam Hamm
FIRST DRAFT: NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. NOTE ALSO: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT WAS IN THE NON- PREFORMAT FONT "BOOKMAN OLD". THIS HAS BEEN CHANGED TO PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK It's finally happened. Hell's frozen over. Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham. Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks uncharacteristically serene almost inviting. Peace has been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello. Salvation Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners. And now, as night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue: "JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers. At a souvenir store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven- year old. Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key chains, ceramic figurines. The kid is already wearing a Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously wants more. Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE BATWING $19.95 and up." A PANHANDLER is perched at the entrance. Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt with the familiar yellow-and-black logo. In Gotham this winter, Batmania is everywhere. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged blizzard. The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are all but empty of cars. A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME. .and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all bundled up in mufflers and parkas. Unbothered by the weather, they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to the few passersby. They've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of "Silent Night" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow. Its sides are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice cream snack POLAR BARS oddly inappropriate for this time of year. A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck as it rounds a corner. The CAROLERS carol. Then a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street followed by the sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM. EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets. The windows have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store. Gut-shot SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT. CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic. The POLAR BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does. The REAR DOORS open. A RAMP slides down from the back of the truck. The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later SLIDE out AGAIN riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES. SIRENS HOWL. A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a trifle too fast FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing into a drift. INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the snow no traction. They're about to climb out and give chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the Salvation Army SANTA. .HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM. The windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already burdened with LOOT. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store but it's difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH. The COP CARS skid to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW. By now, of course, the LOOTERS are gone scooting off on either side of the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks. EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER. A couple of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to avoid getting run over. Every time they poke their heads out, another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches. The ROBBERS fan out in various directions. These guys are obviously going to get away clean unless. The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is blazing in the darkness THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT. INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT MORE SIRENS. A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park one of the few streets which is relatively clear. The COP at the wheel goes wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief. Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park. Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.
COP: What the hell ? Yeah, you heard me. Snowmobiles! So what do we do? Chase 'em on foot??
COP I: .That was
COP II: NO SHIT!!
NO SHIT!!: COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others follow suit. ENGINES REV. As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared a path, they might as well join in the chase. EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT TWO BURLY TEENAGERS both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath are trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of speeding SKIDOOS. Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the .and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view, BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH. Thrilled beyond words, they WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past. INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting from the front of the car. Cool as ever approaching the chase as a simple problem in logic he checks a radar display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS. EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The cops follow along in BATMAN's path. The lead car LOSES CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift. The DRIVER jams the pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the ice. He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other COPS race past him on foot. INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING over the hilly terrain of the park. He spots two of them up ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the left and right. ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate into place. The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him, GAINING FAST. He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN always seems to follow. Just as he approaches the crest of a .the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE. The force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off. His LOOT lands in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION. ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy. When he sees the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a GROVE OF TREES. The trees are too closely spaced for the torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and explodes harmlessly. The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the Batmobile can't follow either. But BATMAN has a Plan B. As he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR, passing the snowmobile on its left. A STEEL SPIKE attached to a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES ITSELF into a distant TREE. The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES directly into the path of the second SNOWMOBILE. The vehicle crashes into the trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over- heels into a drift. In the distance, COPS appear racing to the scene on foot, ready for mop-up duty. BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow. He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four, whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance. EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE where a cluster of HOMELESS PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm. They look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and disappear over a crest of a hill. EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4 They bounce down the hillside and SKID arriving at the edge of a frozen-over LAKE. With the roar of the Batmobile behind them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously. Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface of the lake. Now the Batmobile crests the ridge. The car's weight tips suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake. BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just in time but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope. The prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack. The left front tire takes a sudden dip and worse yet, the car is sliding forward. INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no purchase. He can hear the ice cracking beneath him. Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE and the trunk pops open. An industrial-strength GRAPPLING HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away, hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger. INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE vanishing into the distance. He opens ( yet another ) panel on the dashboard. EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4 The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up. They're almost halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled. All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead. Fireworks? No, it's a THERMITE BOMB rocketing past them, hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY. JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they know what's hit them. ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS his big sack filled not with toys, but precious stones. He approaches the edge of the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky outcroppings. He squirts out from behind a boulder into a .and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts behind him. The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying to build up speed. As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the flamethrower. But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of the Batmobile rises half a foot and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air. A heavy NET is strung between them and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the Batmobile barrels down. When the great black machine is almost atop him it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT The COPS are spread out near the entrance. They've rounded up the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot. They hear a dull ROAR in the distance. .and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view, dragging the NET behind it SANTA, his loot, and his snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel. At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS. Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and vanishes whence it came. A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his colleague and SHRUGS:
COP I: .Merry Christmas.
COP II: Gift-wrapped and everything.
GORDON: After a high-speed chase over $750,000 in precious jewels were recovered intact by the police force working in concert with Batman. TAKE BACK THE STREETS! TAKE BACK THE STREETS! TAKE BACK THE
GORDON: I would like to stress that while this city enjoys a special relationship with we do not condone vigilantism
BAT.": And hey! Where does this Gordon get off calling us ? We're not breakin' any laws. We're a group of concerned citizens, that's all just like Batman.
SEKOWSKY: And hey! Where does this Gordon get off calling us ? We're not breakin' any laws. We're a group of concerned citizens, that's all just like Batman.
SEKOWSKY: Hey, lady we're out here on patrol riskin' our necks to protect old biddies like you. If this lame-o Gordon could do his job We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is alive in this city. We're gonna take back the streets!
ALFRED: Sir? MASTER BRUCE??
BRUCE: I'm not deaf, Alfred. I hear you.
ALFRED: I took the liberty of preparing tea. I take it you've been watching the news?
BRUCE: Yeah.lot of crazy people in this world.
ALFRED: I should inform you.Christmas is approaching, and we've received our annual solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund. If I may inquire.?
BRUCE: Oh, yeah. Watch this.
ALFRED: Most ingenious, sir. What exactly
BRUCE: What does it look like?
ALFRED: To the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like.the skeleton of an
BRUCE: Good guess, Alfred. That's exactly right.
ALFRED: Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use. Now the Toy Fund. Our contribution last year was a half-million dollars.
BRUCE: We can do better than that.
ALFRED: Then there's the foster-parents program. the Gotham homeless crusade. Is something troubling you, sir?
BRUCE: Yeah.the holidays, I guess. Always gets me thinking about. And to tell you the truth, I'm a little concerned about Vicki.
ALFRED: Miss Vale, sir.?
BRUCE: Yeah. I've been thinking about it lately. Thinking about it a lot. .and I still can't figure out what to get her for Christmas.
GUARD: Up and at 'em, Pengy. Pengy?
PAROLE OFFICER: You want to return the money you stole.
BONIFACE: Intact. The map will show you where it's
PAROLE OFFICER: MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table as if he finds the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to
MR. BONIFACE: Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in full. I want to be a part of civilized Prison life is not for me. The guilt, the fear, the constant shame.one meets a disturbingly low class of people.
WARDEN: His record's clean. Thirteen years without an incident.
ATTORNEY: I'd like to point out, my client's put his time to good use. A student of ornithology.articles published in several respected journals.
MR. BONIFACE: Birds, yes. My only source of solace.
PAROLE OFFICER: In light of this rather extraordinary gesture, I see no reason not to endorse your application for parole.
BONIFACE: Thank you, sir. You won't regret it.
MYNAH: CRIME DOES NOT PAY. AAWWK!! CRIME DOES NOT PAY.
ATTORNEY: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY Free time the cell doors are open and the convicts are milling around in the common area. T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb, hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate, MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES. BONIFACE whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH
MR. BONIFACE: Shit, Pengy. I let 'em
MR. BONIFACE: Hermione. My canary. It's the dead of
MR. BONIFACE: I see. You might as well have this. I won't be needing it. Well, thanks, Pengy. No hard feelings. Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little ass of yours.
MR. BONIFACE: You won't miss it long.
FRICK: Welcome back, Mr. Boniface.
PENGUIN: Mr. Frick. Mr. Frack. Our years of planning are about to pay off.
PENGUIN: I take it they found the money all right?
FRACK: We buried it exactly as you specified.
PENGUIN: How much have we got left?
FRICK: Let's see an initial capitalization of 42 million and change, compounded over thirteen years, at an annual return of just under sixteen percent
PENGUIN: Fine, fine. How
FRICK: Seventy-nine million. Excluding the sum we buried.
PENGUIN: Speaking of burials.
VICKI: Guess what, Alfred. I think I found a present for Bruce. Skis. Don't let on, okay?
ALFRED: He won't hear a word of it from me.
VICKI: He's such a nightmare to shop for. What do you get him year after year, I find you can't go wrong with surveillance equipment. Let me put this under the tree.
ALFRED: I find you can't go wrong with surveillance equipment. Let me put this under the tree.
VICKI: Not so fast.
ALFRED: Why, Miss Vale !
VICKI: Don't look. It's your present. What'd you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
BRUCE: What'd you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
VICKI: I'm going to give you the happiest Christmas you've ever had.
VICKI: ( beat ) I was just down here Tuesday. Seems like there's more every day. Christmas time. And they say there's over a thousand people living in the park
BRUCE: The light changes. BRUCE throws the car into gear and at the next intersection turns the car right, into the park. EXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to Gotham's elite. A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as BRUCE'S CAR pulls up. A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush. The liveried DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically sorry for the inconvenience as they enter. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Post-dinner. VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the table in front of BRUCE shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park.
VICKI: They're already razing the tenements and SRO's downtown. These people don't have anyplace else to go. If the city starts selling off the park.
BRUCE: Yeah. I guess I'll pass on dessert.
VICKI: Bruce, you do a lot more than most people even dream of.
BRUCE: Sure. Comes off the top of my taxes
VICKI: That's not what I meant.
BRUCE: What I "do" doesn't come close to the root of the problem, Vicki. I'm just a Band-Aid.
BRUCE: Randall. You remember Vicki. How's the construction business?
SHAW: The park tower? All systems go. can get the junkies and winos cleared Not too late to get in on the deal.
BRUCE: I'll think about it.
SHAW: Say, Walter Barrett's due back from Europe. We should all get together at the Nice to see you again, Miss Veal.
VICKI: What a pig.
BRUCE: I've known him since he was seven years old. He was a pig then too.
VICKI: Now he wants to gobble up the Bruce isn't there something you can do about people like that?
BRUCE: What, tie him up with a bat-rope?
VICKI: No, you idiot. I meant
JOGGER: I was attacked. Three men in ski masks
COP I: And these two broke it up?
JOGGER: These two?? They ran like rabbits. I never saw anybody take off so
COP II: You. SHUT UP, all right?? Lady, who was it that bailed you out??
JOGGER: just came out of nowhere and tore into It was so quick I didn't even see his Dumb shit. Shouldn'ta been jogging in the park at night anyway. Look around you. It's fulla bums. Nice outfit.
BRUCE: Nice outfit.
ANCHORWOMAN: .and tomorrow, the city's power elite will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett, who returns to Gotham after a five-year stay in Europe.
RICKY: Yo. Ricky here. What's the haps? Midnight. No sweat. See you then.
SELINA: Well. "Ricky," is it?
RICKY: How'd you know that?
SELINA: I heard you on the phone. Talking to your Girlfriend? No, no. That was
RICKY: Girlfriend? No, no. That was
SELINA: If you've got time for a little pleasure .maybe you'd like to buy me a drink. Jeez they look almost real.
RICKY: Jeez they look almost real.
SELINA: Why wouldn't they be?
RICKY: You'd have to be crazy. Nobody'd wear the real thing to a dive like this.
SELINA: Oh, they're real, all right. So are Weren't we going to have a drink?
LIEUTENANT: It's pure.
LOOK!: BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away. Clad in inky black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK. Studded, with openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS. She bares her teeth and HISSES. It's a woman. BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized. In the time it takes him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS. She SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke, RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat. He slumps to the deck, lifeless. The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him toppling into the water. The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the pier. She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the boat landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier. Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky specimens remain behind. She somersaults forward; takes one goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more reeling with swift talon-slashes. The whole frenzied mop-up action takes just under ten seconds. Alone at last, she stands back to survey the scene. Counting the stiff's on the boat which is now receding in the harbor there must be well over a dozen dead. The snow is speckled with red. A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down and softly MOANING. Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the wreckage of the smashed shipping crates. BINDLES OF WHITE POWDER millions of dollars' worth are scattered all about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested. Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the sides of the crates. She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel. She opens it carefully and holds it up for inspection. The statuette of a RAVEN carved from solid onyx glistens in the The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the MOANING PUNK's back pocket. Then, cradling the raven under one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet. A LANTERN approaches. It's an OLD SALT some kind of hapless night watchman and his face goes bone-white at the sight of the carnage on the docks. He kneels beside the moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS because the PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS.
PUNK: Murcielago. MURCIELAGO!!
FRICK: Mr. Boniface? Your.visitor has arrived.
PENGUIN: Thank you, Mr. Frick. Show her in.
PENGUIN: Ah, Miss Kyle! At last we meet.
SELINA: At last we meet. Pigeons?
PENGUIN: Yes, they're common birds dirty, stupid, unattractive but they're very obedient, and they do crap on people's heads. May I? I see your reputation was not exaggerated.
SELINA: I've located the others. All but one. I'm surprised you don't catch pneumonia !
PENGUIN: My normal body temperature is ninety-two degrees. Germs find me inhospitable.
SELINA: I see why they call you the Penguin.
PENGUIN: They may call me that.but rarely more than once. Champagne? My dear. Here's to the second biggest crime in the history of Gotham City.
BULLOCK: It wasn't about the drugs. Whoever it was left thirty kilos sitting on the docks. Un silueta negra con colmillos, y garras el demonio. El murcielago.
MURCIELAGO!: What's that he keeps saying?
GORDON: What's that he keeps saying?
BULLOCK: "Murcielago." Bat.
GORDON: Nonsense. That dock looked like a slaughter-house. Batman's never committed We did find this in his back pocket.
BULLOCK: We did find this in his back pocket.
POLICEMAN: Commissioner? We've got Barrett. Fine welcome. These storm troopers of yours dragged me away from my coming-home I'd like to know the meaning of this
BARRETT: Fine welcome. These storm troopers of yours dragged me away from my coming-home I'd like to know the meaning of this
GORDON: I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure cocaine wound up concealed in your personal effects.
BARRETT: Gordon I come from one of the oldest and most influential familles in Gotham. If you plan to accuse me of smuggling drugs, be my guest. I'll have your badge before you leave this Book the son of a bitch.
GORDON: Book the son of a bitch.
BARRETT: I believe I'm still entitled to a phone
SHAW: Come on! Let's move it! We're an hour behind as it is!!
SHAW: Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo!
HARDHAT: Phone call, Mr. Shaw. Guy said it's Hold the ball. I wanna hear it crash.
SHAW: Hold the ball. I wanna hear it crash.
BARRETT: It's me, Randall Walter Barrett. I want you to call my attorney. That was my shipment they busted up last night.
SHAW: Jesus, Walter, I Why are you calling me??
BARRETT: It's worse than that. Somebody took my

VICKI: I'd sure like to know what shook him up so. He was out of there like a scared
WILK: Got a blind tip from downtown. You know that massacre on the docks? Batman. Whoa! Is this on the level?

WILK: Cops even got a note. "Those who feed on the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!" Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a

ALFRED: I'm afraid so, Miss Vale. Master Bruce is sequestered in the cave. Walter Barrett's no saint. His factories have been dumping poison into the air and water for years.

BATMAN: SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone. We're in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction magnate. There's obviously money to be made in real-estate development because the walls are lined with art, and the floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new Brancusi which rests on a pedestal near the windows. An UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back to the camera.
WOMAN: It's a fake.
SHAW: Hmm. It cost me a half a million dollars. You're sure?
WOMAN: Absolutely. You see, I.happen to know where the real one is stashed.
SHAW: I guess you'd know. I have some "friends" in the art world. They say that for certain hard-to-get items you're the one to call.
SHAW: They say for the right price.you could steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel Mr. Shaw. Do you believe everything you Oh, I'm not one to judge. I admire people who take what they want. I'm just curious how you do it.
SHAW: Oh, I'm not one to judge. I admire people who take what they want. I'm just curious how you do it.
SELINA: I find that the old methods work best.
SHAW: Hey, what are you doing ?
SELINA: You're very inquisitive. You'll just have to be disciplined.
SHAW: You know, I've.I've never really done this kind of thing before.
SELINA: I think people should indulge their fantasies. Don't you? Hey, what are those what are you
SHAW: Hey, what are those what are you
COP: EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT Forty stories up. The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she scurries along the ledge SPRINGS at a cornice and in one lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF. She scampers across the rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle, like a mountain climber until she reaches the building at the end of the block. Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack. She pulls out a retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around, HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street. EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead where the small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides she's out of danger. Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches, emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure. She's just made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped for a moment of Quality Time. She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over. Her whole body tenses and though her head doesn't move her eyes dart left. A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line. The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest of seconds before he steps back into the shadows. She acts like she hasn't noticed. .but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same. TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT His eyes widen his LIPS PART as he watches her. If it's possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're seeing it now. HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She still doesn't let on that she's seen him. Instead, she goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a gymnast on the balance beam POSING for him in a little private show a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit. EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT His jaw is down around his knees. Whoa. He edges forward slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her. She hears a noise. Stops. Makes a big show of looking left and right. Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN jumps back into the shadows. She gathers her things; a small WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and she VANISHES over the edge. Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in time to see EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building, flipping down from one fire escape to tile next a master gymnast. Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect landing on the roof of a passing BUS. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BATMAN turns and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD. He kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled upon it.
JESUS!: EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT Forty stories up. The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she scurries along the ledge SPRINGS at a cornice and in one lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF. She scampers across the rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle, like a mountain climber until she reaches the building at the end of the block. Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack. She pulls out a retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around, HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street. EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead where the small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides she's out of danger. Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches, emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure. She's just made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped for a moment of Quality Time. She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over. Her whole body tenses and though her head doesn't move her eyes dart left. A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line. The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest of seconds before he steps back into the shadows. She acts like she hasn't noticed. .but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same. TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT His eyes widen his LIPS PART as he watches her. If it's possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're seeing it now. HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She still doesn't let on that she's seen him. Instead, she goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a gymnast on the balance beam POSING for him in a little private show a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit. EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT His jaw is down around his knees. Whoa. He edges forward slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her. She hears a noise. Stops. Makes a big show of looking left and right. Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN jumps back into the shadows. She gathers her things; a small WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and she VANISHES over the edge.

ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BATMAN turns and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD. He kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled upon it.
COP: Hey. You see what I saw.?
BULLOCK: It's Randall Shaw. Torn to ribbons. We just made Batman up on the roof.
GORDON: Oh God.
VICKI: Please, just one. It's important for people to see what's happening.
HOMELESS MAN: They don't want to see us, lady. They just want us gone out of sight, and out of mind. Get worse before it gets better. It always does.
VICKI: you. I
KID: Twenty bucks.
VICKI: Twenty bucks.
KID: Twenty bucks.
VICKI: and then he's bounding off like a shot. VAULTING up into a tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches. VICKI starts to follow, but there's no way she can keep up. Instead she digs into her CAMERA BAG. HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the treetops. She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from limb to limb. For a moment it seems like she's lost him. As she sweeps the lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance. She ups the magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal. The stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE BRUCE's great-grandfather. As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet from the statue VICKI's got him in her sights again. He looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small hillocks, over a frozen creek. There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter, mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place behind him. Home sweet home. EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT as she lowers the lens. Her face is full of conflicting emotions. She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find out what his story is. But on the other hand even the homeless are entitled to their privacy.

PENGUIN: ( sputtering wildly ) Are you sure it was him? What did he do?
SELINA: He stood on a roof and watched me. He didn't realize I'd seen him. I don't think he knew quite what to make of me. But he was definitely interested.
PENGUIN: This scheme of yours is backfiring. We don't need him on our tails. Do you know how much money is at stake here?
SELINA: Money isn't everything. What's the point if we can't enjoy
VICKI: Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out.then vanished into a drainage pipe right next to the statue of General Wayne.
BRUCE: My illustrious great-grandfather. Think it's the same kid we heard about?

BRUCE: Well. He's changed tactics, hasn't he.
GORDON: Shaw, with his high-rises Barrett, a druglord, major polluter they weren't exactly model citizens. Who knows, it could be some crazy social-conscience kind of thing.

BRUCE: Good to see you two. Looks like the Five Families are suddenly down to three. In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on this room right now
PROVOST: Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce?
BRUCE: Not at all. Commissioner Gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards.
BRUCE: Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would be after us. Can you?
SELINA: You two look like you need a drink. And is this who I think it is?

TIPTREE: It's just so unfair. I mean.it was over a century ago. It's not like we're How could he know? How could Batman know about the Raven Society??
PROVOST: Who knows and who cares. The point is, it's happened. I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm taking the raven with me. I suggest you do the same.
SELINA: He's just another rich idiot. The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit Then he is
PENGUIN: Then he is

BRUCE: You're in a gruesome line of work.
SELINA: Keeps me interested. And that's not easy to do.
BRUCE: This one I know. It's a gryphon, right?
SELINA: Very good. A mythical demon, half-bird, half-lion.sweeping down from the sky to deliver retribution and justice.
BRUCE: Poor guy. Birds and cats you wouldn't think the two halves would cooperate.
SELINA: Only under certain circumstances. I'm really glad you came, Bruce. I was afraid I'd given you the wrong impression. Or maybe it was the right impression.

PROVOST: INT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows all driverless. FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE PROVOST's private elevator, the doors to which are still closed. The PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE.

"JINGLE BELLS.": EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone else when a second newspaper van rumbles past.
NEWS VENDOR: Hey! No! I aleady got a
BATMAN: Who are you?
CATWOMAN: My, aren't we frisky tonight.
CATWOMAN: I should tell you I've got nine lives to play with and you've only got one.
CATWOMAN: Did I tell you I invited company? Keep 'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat.
DISAPPEARING: just as the DOOR gives way and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes crashing out onto the roof! Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight but the COPS are swarming the place. They spot the BODIES on the tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the obvious conclusion. Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE. BULLETS RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE. BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over which is a couple of stories taller than the Globe and REELS HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall. The SWAT COPS score a couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum, but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough to reach the roof.
PENGUIN: Look at that, boys they Ooh. Where have you
CATWOMAN: Ooh. Where have you
CATWOMAN: Cute, huh! I think it'll look nice over the fireplace. Maybe you can drop by and see it sometime. I hope you won't think I'm too. aggressive or anything, but I find you very attractive. It's just so hard to meet interesting men these days. Don't you think so? I have trouble with relationships. Men find me intimidating.kind of predatory, you know? Really I'm not. Really I'm just playful. Don't laugh! I'm trying to open up to I always seem to fall for the wrong guys. You know.most men are rats.
CATWOMAN: you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it. Once you've had your fun there's not much you can do but kill them. But you seem different. I mean, you obviously understand about dressing up. that saves a lot of explaining. I think people should indulge their fantasies, don't you?
CATWOMAN: So I think I'll let you live. Cute boys like you are hard to find. 'Bye, angel. I'll be thinking about you.
CATWOMAN: A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly SEVERED. BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him but he's still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN. He DROPS eight or ten EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to DISLODGE. It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the
CORNICE: which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY. Fascinated, the CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down. ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up toward him. He gets a last-ditch inspiration finds the GAS CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch. The rods in his cape begin to INFLATE. Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge. Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS. Four stories up, he rights himself. Three stories up, he goes into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide arcs over the street. .and a moment later there are no stories left. With an ugly crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES. Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt right in the middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION. EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD. He doesn't move. PEDESTRIANS are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few blocks over. HORNS are honking. A TRAFFIC COP marches He tries to clear the crowd away. A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is forming around the prostrate BATMAN. The COP blows his whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN rush up to join him. They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back. The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body armor. Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters.
DRIVER: What the hell is Awright, what's the problem here?
TRAFFIC COP: Awright, what's the problem here?
PATROLMAN: Good God. Cowan get to the car radio the commissioner!!
TRAFFIC COP: Is he dead? What do we

DICK: It's MINE!
DICK: NO. WAIT!
COP: Dumb son of a bitch!!
ALFRED: Commissioner Gordon called. He wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor in round-the-clock shifts to protect you from Batman.
BRUCE: Great. What'd you tell him?
ALFRED: I told him that since you you'd require no protection from Batman.
BRUCE: In future, sir.I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings.
ALFRED: In future, sir.I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings.
BRUCE: It's just a few bruises.
ALFRED: BRUCE gets up stiffly and buttons his shirt in gingerly fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's
BRUCE: I'm getting too old for this line of work. Cops placed me at the scene of the crime that weird kid of Vicki's saw my I shouldn't worry overmuch. I doubt the two of you move in the same circles.
ALFRED: I shouldn't worry overmuch. I doubt the two of you move in the same circles.
BRUCE: and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman.

GORDON: .Have it analyzed.
POLICEMAN: Mrs. Tiptree? The car's here. I don't wanna go to Grandma's. I wanna stay here with Daddy.
LITTLE GIRL: I don't wanna go to Grandma's. I wanna stay here with Daddy.
MRS. TIPTREE: She's got a nice tree just like ours, honey. Daddy'll be up as soon as he can.
LITTLE GIRL: She's old. She doesn't even have cable.
LITTLE BOY: What about our presents? Don't worry. I'll bring 'em up with me. We'll open 'em when I get there. Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along.
TIPTREE: Don't worry. I'll bring 'em up with me. We'll open 'em when I get there. Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along.
GORDON: Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along.
MRS. TIPTREE: Kids? Tell your Daddy goodbye. They'll be safe, won't they?
TIPTREE: They'll be safe, won't they?
GORDON: As safe as we can make 'em. It would help if you could give us some small hint what this is all about.
TIPTREE: I told you. I.
GORDON: You have no idea what was in that box that Provost had delivered from the bank. All right, Mr. Tiptree. Merry Christmas.
TIPTREE: VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER

BRUCE: Not bad. Sarawak warrior caste.
SELINA: It's like everything in here is another little piece of your mind. I was right about you. Promise, okay? Promise you'll show me every inch of this place.

ALFRED: What exactly are you
BRUCE: Her credit card records. Every major art theft in the last five years she's been on the scene or close to it.
ALFRED: You mean she's some sort of collector? A.cat burglar, or
BRUCE: Could be. Museum curator, authenticator she's got the perfect cover for it. What would she want with that stupid Raven, sir?
ALFRED: Raven, sir?
BRUCE: That's what the Catwoman took from Provost. A little raven statuette, about so big. But it couldn't have been that valuable. How very odd. I'm sure it's nothing, but
ALFRED: How very odd. I'm sure it's nothing, but
BRUCE: What, Alfred?
ALFRED: Your father had a raven, sir. A small statue of the very sort you describe. It used to sit on his desk.
BRUCE: What happened to it?
ALFRED: After your father's.demise, Mr. Tiptree came to the house and asked if he could have it. As a keepsake. I saw no harm. That was thirty years ago.
BRUCE: Wait a minute. Mr. Tiptree?
ALFRED: CUT TO:
BRUCE: What are you looking for Batarangs?
TIPTREE: Bruce! Come on up. I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone.
BRUCE: I brought you a Christmas present. Sorry about the wrapping the police made me open it.
TIPTREE: .I'm afraid I don't have anything for I think you may have something that belonged to my father.
BRUCE: I think you may have something that belonged to my father.
TIPTREE: You know? It'll all be over tomorrow. One way or another, it'll all be over. I've decided, Bruce. I'm gonna give him the last two ravens. He's already got the What are you talking about?
BRUCE: What are you talking about?
TIPTREE: Batman. I don't know how he found out,
BRUCE: Didn't you ever wonder where it came from, Bruce? All the privilege, all the power .all the money? The ravens are a.a kind of map, Bruce. The key to an incredibly vast fortune.
TIPTREE: Didn't you ever wonder where it came from, Bruce? All the privilege, all the power .all the money? The ravens are a.a kind of map, Bruce. The key to an incredibly vast fortune.
BRUCE: Whose fortune?
TIPTREE: Gotham City's.
TIPTREE: In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was looted. It was a fantastic operation perfect military precision. The robbers made off with milllons in gold and silver
BRUCE: The Five Families.
TIPTREE: Our ancestors. They carved it up and ran it into the ground. In five years they were rich beyond We've just been following in their footsteps. And in all this time no one's ever suspected
BRUCE: that they were the ones behind the
TIPTREE: The ravens, and the passed down through generations. Father to son. Your father died before he could tell So they stole his piece of the puzzle.
BRUCE: So they stole his piece of the puzzle.
TIPTREE: Yeah. I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going to hand it over. He's right, you know. We've all been feeding feeding on the soul of Gotham. I don't believe you, Elliott. My father was a decent man an honorable man. He would never have taken part in a scheme like this.
TIPTREE: It wasn't his doing, Bruce. It was
BRUCE: fortune was based on a crime a crime against the city. Reputation or not, he would've tried to
TIPTREE: out for you?!? He was a decent man. He was an honorable man. That's why they had him killed.
TIPTREE: They killed him.to protect their secret .and now the bill's come due. Now the bill's come due.
ALFRED: Thank you, yes, everything's fine. I'll expect your next call in an hour. The police are becoming an awful nuisance.
VICKI: I feel so awful for him, Alfred. There must be something we can do.
ALFRED: I realized long ago that there are places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one will ever penetrate or share. He loves you, Miss Vale. But in certain ways he will always be alone.
BRUCE: Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous with 'Batman.' I think Batman ought to be there when it happens.
ALFRED: I see, sir. When shall we expect you Get your cap. You're driving.
BRUCE: Get your cap. You're driving.
SANTA.": With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the package and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN STATUETTES. He transfers them to the big suitcase then slinks into the hallway. INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown Christmas special on a portable TV. One of them glances out the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the brownstone, SUITCASE in hand.
COP: Mr. Tiptree! What the hell are you
TURNSTILE: just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling down a stairway which leads to the train platform below. INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN. The doors slide shut behind him and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as he rolls off.
COP: We've gotta get back to the radio.
BRUCE: According to this, he's directly
ALFRED: The subway, sir?
BRUCE: Yeah. Take a right.
MYNAH: FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! FOLLOW ME.
BRUCE: He's slowed down. Looks like he's under the park.
ALFRED: How do you propose to get down there, sir? We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a I know another way in. Step on it. They're down there waiting for him.
BRUCE: I know another way in. Step on it. They're down there waiting for him.
MYNAH: AWWRRK! FOLLOW ME.
VOICE: STOP THERE.
TIPTREE: I've cooperated. I've done everything you Open the case. .Two ravens?
PENGUIN: Open the case. .Two ravens?
TIPTREE: The other one is Bruce Wayne's. He doesn't know anything about this. You've got what you want. There's no need
PENGUIN: TIPTREE stands. He backs away from the suitcase warily.
TIPTREE: My family. You won't
PENGUIN: We'll certainly take your unexpected generosity into consideration.
TIPTREE: ( shielding his eyes ) You're not Batman.
PENGUIN: No. I'm his brother-in-law Birdman. Now move out.
WHIRLS SUDDENLY: and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS at the PENGUIN. The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella which happens to be a bulletproof job. The PENGUIN lifts his brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft and TIPTREE staggers backward. SHOT IN THE CHEST. He spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the tracks. The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for signs of life.
CATWOMAN: So sorry to spoil your two ravens. We've got a complete set!
PENGUIN: So sorry to spoil your two ravens. We've got a complete set!
CATWOMAN: Yeah! They're in the suitcase
PENGUIN: Yeah! They're in the suitcase
CATWOMAN: GIVE ME A HAND!
CATWOMAN: Haven't you got anything else to think I'm hot. That was exhausting.
PENGUIN: Haven't you got anything else to think I'm hot. That was exhausting.
CATWOMAN: No pain, no gain! Suck it up. We're not out of here yet.
TUNNELS: arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody. He scans the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies and then his gaze falls on DICK. He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side cradling his head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all around him.
PENGUIN: LETS DO IT!
PENGUIN: Now. Give each raven a quarter-turn. What happens now?
CATWOMAN: What happens now?
PENGUIN: I don't know. That's all.! We've been TRICKED! It's a HOAX! It's
FRICK: No. It's a
CATWOMAN: No. It's a
PENGUIN: about the treasure, eh.? Look at this. It's right under Wayne Manor. It's been there all along! Looks like some kind of cave.
VICKI: No, no don't try to get up you're It's all right. You're safe. You can stay here as long as you need to.
DICK: I don't belong here. You can't keep me
VICKI: It's "Dick", isn't it? Or do you prefer "R" for Richard, right? See, all your things are here. What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit?
VICKI: "R" for Richard, right? See, all your things are here. What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit?
DICK: It's none of your business. What is this, some kind of home?
VICKI: No, not pool tennis court you can have anything you want.
DICK: Tennis court?! Lady, you're rich. How the hell would you know what I want? I'm not staying. You can't
DICK: I'm not staying. You can't
BRUCE: I can make you. Come on. Wanna go at it? Look, kid like it or not, you're my guest and long as you're here you might as well enjoy it. Will you two be okay in here?
ALFRED: What do you propose to do with him, sir? Keep him in the room for the rest of his I don't know, Alfred. I've got other stuff to worry about.
BRUCE: I don't know, Alfred. I've got other stuff to worry about.
ALFRED: The child is hurt, sir. At the very least we should attempt to locate his parents.
BRUCE: He hasn't got any parents.
ALFRED: How do you know that, sir?
BRUCE: .I know. Sir it's Miss Kyle. Well! Tall, dark and handsome. Are we still on for tonight?

BRUCE: Christmas eve. No tree?
SELINA: No presents. I've been a bad girl this
BRUCE: I'm surprised you kept this date. I thought you would've lost interest by now.
SELINA: What makes you say that?
BRUCE: You've got what you want, don't you?
SELINA: I do We've had this date for a long, long time. How much is it going to cost me?
BRUCE: How much is it going to cost me?
SELINA: .To get the ravens back.
BRUCE: .To get the ravens back.
SELINA: You're the oddest man I've ever met. Let's talk later, Bruce. I've got kind of a short fuse.
SELINA: Did I hurt you? Just relax you'll start to enjoy it. Bruce, you look faint. It must be the
BRUCE: What di what did you d I guess I've.gotten under your skin.
SELINA: I guess I've.gotten under your skin.
ALFRED: Everything's fine, thank you. We'll talk in an hour.
PENGUIN: Try his mag card.
FRICK: Look at this. He's a pillhead.
VICKI: Ohh. Am I glad to
PENGUIN: MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!!
VICKI: What did you
SELINA: First-time jitters, I guess. Everything was going great, and then.he just went limp as a noodle.
PENGUIN: You'd be the butler. Why don't you come on down and attend to your guests? Mr. Wayne. Is he ?
ALFRED: Mr. Wayne. Is he ?
PENGUIN: You know how it is. Some guys just can't hold their egg nog. I should explain the occasion of our visit. There's a treasure underneath this house and I don't plan to leave until you tell me how to find it. Now who's going to talk Miss Vale?
PENGUIN: I should explain the occasion of our visit. There's a treasure underneath this house and I don't plan to leave until you tell me how to find it. Now who's going to talk Miss Vale?
VICKI: I don't know what you're talking about.
PENGUIN: The PENGUIN gestures. FRICK holds the gun to her head.
PENGUIN: Then maybe you'd like to tell me.
ALFRED: You're no more than a common thief.
PENGUIN: Wrong, you old idiot. I happen to be a very uncommon thief. Are you going to tell me, or does Miss Vale get an early present this year? Then go ahead, Mr. Frick.
ALFRED: Then go ahead, Mr. Frick.
PENGUIN: Then go ahead, Mr. Frick.
SELINA: ( crossing over to VICKI ) We don't know how to get down there yet. We may need her when Bruce wakes up. Besides I want this one for myself. So pretty.I'm going to give her a brand new face for Christmas.
PENGUIN: Why don't you two tie up our host? It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it? Just the sort of setting in which I've always imagined myself. I see. You think I'm vulgar. You think I think you're a dirty little man with See, boys, that's old money talking. After a while, they actually start to believe they've earned all this. I don't mind. Someday I'll be old money too when the statute of limitations runs out.

PENGUIN: Let's spread out and see what we can find. You two keep an eye on our friends here. Give me a yell the minute Wayne comes to.
FRICK: Better check it out. What is it? What's going on??
FRACK: Some kind of security system
DICK: Can you
BRUCE: Library got to get me to the library
PENGUIN: What is that ungodly racket?
FRACK: A security alarm. It went off in the My God! Is someone
PENGUIN: My God! Is someone
BRUCE: I'll go back.
DICK: I'll go back.
BRUCE: I can't.get down there.without you.
PENGUIN: What an extraordinarily stupid thing to SHUT UP. Help me with him.
VICKI: SHUT UP. Help me with him.
PENGUIN: You and I had better check the ground floor and see what's going on. Mr. Frick do you think you'll be able to manage this pair?
FRICK: Yes sir.
PENGUIN: Oh, good. That Where's Wayne???
PENGUIN: Check the grounds! The shape he's in, he can't have gotten far. Wait for my signal. You know what to do.
BRUCE: as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait for my signal. You know what to do.
DICK: Here. You might need it.
ALFRED: Thank you, Master Dick. And.
SELINA: You know, I've got a great recipe for Sliced Bitch
SELINA: I love a good old-fashioned catfight but this is pissing me off.
SELINA: HERE, kitty kitty kitty.HERE, kitty
SELINA: So this is where you earn your keep.
SELINA: Mmm! Frederick's of Gotham? Not so loud, honey! The neighbors'll get the wrong idea. Santa's coming. Time for all good girls to go to sleep.
SELINA: Not so loud, honey! The neighbors'll get the wrong idea. Santa's coming. Time for all good girls to go to sleep.
BATMAN: Miss me, "Angel"? Okay let's do it, huh? You and me. all the way this time.
SELINA: Okay let's do it, huh? You and me. all the way this time.
VICKI: Come on. We'll be safe in the cave.
VICKI: Come on. Come with us.
DICK: No. I can still help.
PENGUIN: Such primitive entertainment. So Bruce equals Batman. It seems I've discovered two treasures! Don't move. I'd be only too happy to shoot you both.
PENGUIN: The Gotham City Treasury. It's about to be stolen twice.
ALFRED: Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to get it out of here.
PENGUIN: Oh, I'll manage somehow. You two are my guarantee of that. Let's have a look, shall we? You go
SELINA: It could've been so nice you and me if only you weren't so screwed up.
BATMAN: It's over. I don't want to hurt you any Tell me something one thing. If you don't enjoy all this.why do you do it? I'll never understand men.
SELINA: Tell me something one thing. If you don't enjoy all this.why do you do it? I'll never understand men.
BATMAN: Nine lives.
CATWOMAN: I can't move. I can't move.
BATMAN: BATMAN slowly rises to his feet. She lets out another gruesome WHINE.
CATWOMAN: COME ON. Don't stop now. FINISH ME OFF. Son of a bitch. You're all alike.
DICK: You should've done it, man. You should've killed her.
BATMAN: There's a radio in the cave. We'll send for help.
PENGUIN: Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne. Look at you now. Whatever would your friends say? You've been an exceptionally congenial host but I must ask you to back off.
PENGUIN: No sudden moves. It's a long way down.
BATMAN: An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG. Clean hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down across the rocks. With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath and VAULTS toward the CATWALK. She's a foot short; she grabs hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to pull herself up. BATMAN races toward her but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN. The BATS have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN. THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward. As the second spins him around. As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE

GORDON: .and then Batman showed up?
BRUCE: He saved all our lives, Jim. I can't say for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind the murders.
GORDON: God I pray you're right. One thing before we go, Bruce. Who's the
BRUCE: Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin. He's in town for the holidays.
GORDON: Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit. Merry Christmas, Bruce. Good luck cleaning this place up.
