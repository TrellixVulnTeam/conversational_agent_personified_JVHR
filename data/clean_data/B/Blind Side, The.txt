GRANGER: Do you find it odd? Your Iono [I don't know]. Investigator Granger sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in. She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window, rubs his knees some more.

GRANGER: ( WITH FINALITY )
A12: A12 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY DAY Big Tony strides down the almost empty hallway, spots a door.
BIG TONY: They say you the coach. Cotton eyes Tony, offers a hand.
COTTON: Bert Cotton.
BIG TONY: Tony Hamilton, but everybody call me Big Tony.
COTTON: What can I do for you, Tony?
STEVEN: Sure is pretty, huh, Big Mike? Mike doesn't answer, just takes it all in. Steven sees and opens a container filled to the brim with balls - footballs, basketballs, four square balls.
MICHAEL: White people are crazy.
BIG TONY: You see I promised my mama Boo, on her deathbed, that I would get Steven outta public and into a church school.
COTTON: I appreciate that but I'm not involved with admissions.
BIG TONY: I figured I'd come to you; seeing as you might need some players.
COTTON: What sport does he play?
BIG TONY: Anything with a ball. Good, too. He has Cotton's attention for a moment, then it passes.
COTTON: Classes start in a week. It'd have to be for next semester.
BIG TONY: I know what you're thinking, Coach, but I got money. I'm a mechanic at Wilson's Auto t'other side of town.
COTTON: "They?" You only mentioned one son.
BIG TONY: Steven, yessir, but I brought another boy along.
COTTON: Another boy?
BIG TONY: Yeah, Big Mike. He stays on our couch sometimes. It's a bad deal. His mama's on the crack pipe and he ain't got nobody. He just wanted to come along with us today.
COTTON: Would. Big Mike be an applicant as well?
BIG TONY: Yeah, sure, why not. Cotton sighs, considers what to do.
COTTON: They'd have to fill out applications and make an appointment for interviews.
BIG TONY: I was hopin' you might just interview 'em now.
COTTON: They're here? Big Tony points out the.window to the playground where Steven and Michael are playing one on one basketball.
BIG TONY: The little ones Steven and the big
ONE'S: Big Mike.
COTTON: Big Mike.
BIG TONY: Yeah. That's right.
COTTON: Mother of God.
COTTON: Are there spots available or not? PAUL SANDSTROM, Principal, taps his fingers before.
SANDSTROM: Technically, yes, in both grades. But we have a greater responsibility than just filling classrooms. Steven Hamilton's paperwork looks acceptable and I believe he would be capable of succeeding here but the other kid Sandstrom looks through papers for the name.
COTTON: Big Mike.
SANDSTROM: Michael Oher gives us no reason to believe, based on his record, that he would be successful here.
COTTON: How bad could it be? Another board member, MRS. SMITH, pores over Michael's file, which is a mess. She finds facts and lays them out -
MRS. SMITH: We're not sure exactly how old he is due to lack of records. He has a measured IQ of 80. That's 6th percentile. He's been enrolled in seven different institutions, including a gap of eighteen months around the age of ten when he apparently didn't attend school at all. He repeated first grade as well as second, there's no record of attendance in third, and in fourth grade
COTTON: So they moved him ahead without going to third grade. That says MRS. SMITH His attendance records are abysmal and his grade point average begins with a zero. Zero-point-six- Silence around the room. MRS. BOSWELL, a board member and science teacher, looks to the others.
MRS. SMITH: ( IGNORING COTTON )
MRS. BOSWELL: Everyone passed him along - gave him D's so they could hand their problem off to the next school.
COTTON: Brave kid. ( off their confusion ) For wanting to come here. For wanting a quality education. An education denied him by the poor quality of the schools he's attended. Most kids with his background wouldn't come within two hundred miles of this place.
MRS. SMITH: Coach Cotton, we understand your interest in the young man's athletic abilities.
SANDSTROM: He wouldn't be able to play until he got his grades up anyway.
COTTON: Forget sports! Look at the wall. He points to the crest on the wall. Beneath it: "NEIGHBORLY,
MRS. BOSWELL: Class, this is Mike Oher and he's new here so I expect you all to make him feel welcome. ( with a warm smile ) Mike, take any empty seat.
MRS. BOSWELL: It's okay.
MICHAEL: Can I leave now? She nods and watches him stand and walk away. She glances down at the sheet, turns it over and sees. A DRAWING on the back - a boat on an ocean. On the boat is a single, stick figure person. It's sweet but looks like a third grader drew it.
STEVEN: Hey, Big Mike, um. my Pops' girlfriend. she don't really want you to stay with us no more. Big Tony's Taurus pulls into the lot.
MICHAEL: Naw, it's aright.
LEIGH ANNE: ( on cell phone ) I don't care if Patrick Ramsey did approve the chair. He's an NFL quarterback not Martha frickin'
SEAN: S.J., you know that kid?
SJ: What kid?
SEAN: Black kid. Up in the corner.
SI: Be goes to high school here. His name is Big something. Big Mike. Sean eyes Michael suspiciously.
SEAN: He look like a volleyball fan to Leigh Anne, loaded up with refreshments, makes her way up the stands to her family. She has a nod, a smile, a bon mot, for everyone she passes. As she sits.
LEIGH ANNE: What'd I miss?
SEAN: Collins got a dig.
SI: It's girl's volleyball, Mom. You didn't miss anything. Leigh Anne gives him a look then stands and shouts
LEIGH ANNE: Collins! Move your feet! ON THE COURT - COLLINS TUOHY, a beautiful 16-year-old, sighs and gives her mother a look - "Don't embarrass me!"
LEIGH ANNE: Collins, we'll wait outside. And don't double condition in the shower - you still have homework!
COLLINS: I'm going over to Cannon's house to Can I go.to the Johnson's for dinner? They invited me.
SI: Can I go.to the Johnson's for dinner? They invited me.
LEIGH ANNE: What's so awful about our house? Sean smiles, shakes his head as SJ and Collins leave.
BOB: I don't think he has any idea what I'm teaching.
GLENDA: And how would you know if he did? He won't even talk. Mrs. Boswell can't contain herself.
MRS. BOSWELL: He writes.
APRIL: His name. Barely. Mrs. Boswell goes to'her purse, pulls out a crumpled page.
MRS. BOSWELL: He threw this in the trash can. ( reads from the page ) "I look and I see white everywhere: white walls, white floors, and a lot of white people. The teachers do not know I have no idea of anything they are talking about. I do not want to listen to anyone, especially the teachers.
BOB: How's the spelling? Mrs. Boswell stuffs the page back in her purse and leaves.
COTTON: If he makes his grades he'll be eligible in the spring.
SEAN: If he makes his grades.
COTTON: But boy-hidey, just look at him. Cotton is admiring Michael's size but Sean sees something else. He stands, walks over to Michael, who barely looks up.
SEAN: What did you eat for lunch today?
MICHAEL: Here in the cafeteria.
SEAN: I didn't ask where you ate, I asked what you ate.
MICHAEL: A few things.
SEAN: Do you need some money? For lunch?
MICHAEL: I don't need any. Sean walks back over to Coach Cotton.
SEAN: Buy him a semester lunch pass and put it on my bill. ( off Cotton's look ) He's hungry.
COTTON: You could tell that by looking at give you free lunch, Bert. And when food is finite, you'd be surprised how much time you can spend thinking about it..
MRS. BOSWELL: You'll have one hour. If you finish early put it on my desk and sit quietly. She looks at the class as they begin to work, then sees Michael just staring at his test. She sighs, makes a decision, rises and walks over.
MRS. BOSWELL: You can take the test back here away from everybody else. I'll sit in there so if there's anything you don't understand you can ask.
MICHAEL: MRS. BOSWELL Just try. Ask questions if you don't understand. But still Michael stares at the page. The look on her face says she's about to give up when He lifts his eyes to her and points to the question on the test - specifically to the word MRS. BOSWELL ( CONT'D ) "Classified". It means how things are grouped together.
MRS. BOSWELL: Just try. Ask questions if you don't understand. But still Michael stares at the page. The look on her face says she's about to give up when He lifts his eyes to her and points to the question on the test - specifically to the word MRS. BOSWELL ( CONT'D ) "Classified". It means how things are grouped together.
MICHAEL: Like our "class"?
MRS. BOSWELL: Exactly. This science course is classified based on what grade y'all are in. Eleventh. Michael nods understanding.
MRS. BOSWELL: He knows it!
BOB: Who knows it and what does he know?
MRS. BOSWELL: The material. Michael Oher. I gave him this test verbally. She holds up the test marked with a large red "C".
APRIL: On how big a curve?
MRS. BOSWELL: He's been listening the whole time. It's amazing what he's absorbed. And, trust me, he's listening to you, too. Okay, so his reading level is low and he has no idea how to learn in a classroom, but. ( makes her point ) I'm not saying he's going to pass but Big Mike is not stupid.
MICHAEL: They're stuck, not sure if they should talk to this "stranger". They jump off the swings and run away.
LEIGH ANNE: Who's that SJ?
SI: Big Mike.
LEIGH ANNE: Get your feet off my dash.
SANDSTROM: Mike, I just got a call from someone at the police department. ( off Michael's look ) Do you remember the story in the papers awhile back about the man who fell off an overpass? ( Michael shakes his head ) No one knew who he was and they're not sure if he jumped, or if. at any rate he passed away. Sandstrom struggles with how to say the words.
MICHAEL: I'll try and find out where he's buried. Maybe we could go visit? Michael nods, then rises and walks away.
SANDSTROM: I'll try and find out where he's buried. Maybe we could go visit? Michael nods, then rises and walks away.
LEIGH ANNE: Turn on the heat!
SEAN: I don't know where it is.
LEIGH ANNE: It's fifteen degrees, you've had this car a month and you don't know how to turn on the heat?! ( as she turns it on ) What would you do without.me?
SEAN: Lots of things you'll never know They trade a look and a smile. Sean puts a.hand on her lap.
SI: Get a room.
LEIGH ANNE: Si, don't let this go to your head but I thought you were very convincing in the role of. uh.
SI: Indian Number Three. I tried out for the Chief but they gave it to Andy Sung. I can't be sure but I think there was some multi-cultural bias thing working.
SEAN: Or maybe they just thought he'd make a better Chief.
SI: Dad, he's like Chinese.
LEIGH ANNE: And you're Irish. If you weren't the Chief how come you got the Si hesitates a bit before
SI: Dad, I'm gonna need a few more of those free Quesadilla tickets.
LEIGH ANNE: ( LAUGHS )
SEAN: Don't laugh too hard. The Quesadilla saved our ass.
LEIGH ANNE: What is he wearing? It's below freezing. What's his name again?
LEIGH ANNE: Where's he going? She gives Sean a look. Sean rolls down his window.
SEAN: Hey, Big Mike! Michael stops in the crosswalk, looks to the car.
MICHAEL: Sean nods, rolls his window back up and drives as the light turns green.
LEIGH ANNE: The gym? It's nine o'clock. No answer to this. They drive another half block,before
LEIGH ANNE: Big Mike, my name is Leigh Anne Tuohy. My kids go to Wingate. You said you're going to the gym? Michael slowly nods.
MICHAEL: Because. it's warm. This hits her all at once. She bites her lip.
LEIGH ANNE: Do you have anywhere to stay Michael eyes the ground, then nods.
SEAN: I've seen that look many times. She's about to get her way. Leigh Anne makes her way back to the car, with Michael in tow. She opens the back door and he gets in next to SJ in his headdress. Leigh Anne climbs into the front seat, closes the door. Sean is looking at her.
LEIGH ANNE: 46 EXT. RITZY NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 46
COLLINS: How'd the dork do in the play? She turns to see. Sean, Leigh Anne, SJ in headdress and Big Mike.
LEIGH ANNE: I'd give you the guest bedroom but it's full of sample boxes. And the sectional in the family room slides apart when you sleep on it. At least that's what Sean says.
MICHAEL: Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the couch?
LEIGH ANNE: Only when he's bad. There's a powder room right there and we're upstairs if you need us. The two share a look, then.
SJ: SJ is in the doorway to the kitchen.
LEIGH ANNE: Was this a bad idea?
SEAN: LEIGH ANNE
LEIGH ANNE: Don't lie there and pretend you're not thinking the same thing as me.
SEAN: Fine, tell me what you're thinking so I can know what's supposed to be on my mind.
LEIGH ANNE: How well do you know Big Mike?
SEAN: In case you haven't noticed he doesn't have much to say. What's the big deal? It's just one night. ( after a beat ) It is just one night, right?.. Leigh Anne?.
LEIGH ANNE: Do you think he'll steal anything?
SEAN: I guess we'll know in. the morning. He rolls over to go to sleep. Leigh Anne just sits, stares.
LEIGH ANNE: If you hear a scream call the insurance adjustor.
LEIGH ANNE: Up and at 'em. Collins groans. Leigh Anne picks up a few pieces of clothes. on her way out and groans at the mess. We stay with her as she re-enters the hallway, walks and opens the door to
LEIGH ANNE: Sean Junior! She opens the shades.
LEIGH ANNE: Mike? Big Mike?! Nothing. She hears a DOG BARKING in the neighborhood and moves to the window to look out.
LEIGH ANNE: Big Mike!
MICHAEL: LEIGH ANNE
LEIGH ANNE: Are you spending Thanksgiving with your family? Michael shakes his head.
LEIGH ANNE: Come and get it! Sean sits at the TV,"watching an Ole Miss football game, while SJ plays.video games on another. Collins chats on her cell. Michael sits off to the side, taking it all in.
SEAN: SJ, Ole Miss is about to score!
SI: Which means they're about to They all shuffle over, grab plates, start piling on food. Sean loads his plate and heads back to the couch.
SEAN: Looks great, hon. Collins plate is pretty delicately apportioned.
COLLINS: I see a lot of starch. SJ jams turkey into a roll and lathers on cranberry sauce - creating an easy to eat sandwich. He walks away.
LEIGH ANNE: As much as you want.
SI: Why are we eating in here? Leigh Anne holds out her hands.
LEIGH ANNE: Shall we say grace? The Tuohy family plus Michael hold hands. Collins stares at her tiny hand intertwined with Michael's. As Leigh Anne prays Michael tries to emulate behavior without closing his eyes, taking it all in.
MICHAEL: I qot clothes.
LEIGH ANNE: You "have" clothes.. And an extra T- shirt in a plastic bag does not a wardrobe make. He looks out the window.
MICHAEL: I don't like to be called Big Mike. She wasn't expecting this, nods her head.
LEIGH ANNE: Okay. Mike or Michael? ( off his shrug ) Tell you what, from now on, to me, 'you're Michael. So,. Michael, where we headed?
LEIGH ANNE: This is where your mother lives? He nods and she opens her door.
MICHAEL: Don't get out!
LEIGH ANNE: Who's going to help you with your Don't get out of the car. Michael gets out on his side and takes care to push the lock before he closes the door. She watches as he walks toward the structure, then notices several of the local ne'er-do-wells eyeing her. she locks the doors again, just for luck.
MICHAEL: ( POINTED )
ALTON: Big Mike! Where you been?! Michael ignores, keeps walking.
MICHAEL: Hey, David. David, a little embarrassed to be with Alton, nods back.
MICHAEL: She wadn't home.
LEIGH ANNE: We can come back. Michael takes this in, looks out the window.
MICHAEL: She prolly moved to a nicer place.
LEIGH ANNE: I've lived in Memphis my whole life and never been anywhere near here. You're going to take care of me, I got your back.
MICHAEL: I got your back.
LEIGH ANNE: That's good to know. Thank you. As they start to walk, Leigh Anne reaches up and takes Michael's arm. He holds it out for her.
SALESMAN: Everything I got to fit him will be -right here.
LEIGH ANNE: This is it? If this is all you got why's it say "Big and Tall" on the Big and Tall. You need "Bigger and He walks away. She starts to pore through the small rack.
SALESMAN: Big and Tall. You need "Bigger and He walks away. She starts to pore through the small rack.
LEIGH ANNE: Anything you like?
SHE: He shakes his head again. After a beat he points. almost laughs.
LEIGH ANNE: Have a great day. Learn something! They say a few good-byes, get out and walk toward the arch. Only then do we see what Michael is wearing: a GARGANTUAN
BETH: The best part about Paris was the
LEIGH ANNE: Any of y'all spent much time on the other side of town?
ELAINE: On the freeway.
SHERRY: Where exactly are you talking Alabama Street. Hurt Village.
LEIGH ANNE: Alabama Street. Hurt Village.
BETH: Hurt Village that sounds like a You're not far off.
LEIGH ANNE: You're not far off.
SHERRY: It would "hurt" me to go there.
ELAINE: It would certainly hurt your reputation to go there.
BETH: ( tongue in cheek ) I'm actually from there but didn't mind hard work and look where I am Eating an eighteen dollar salad.
LEIGH ANNE: Eating an eighteen dollar salad.
BETH: And it's a little soggy to be Such a shame.
SHERRY: Such a shame.
BETH: ( re: her salad ) Yes it is.
SHERRY: Civil rights was responsible for some good things but those programs - building ugly, low cost housing. I mean how could you be creative if you lived there? It's stifling.
ELAINE: Did you know that black men were employed at a higher rate before those programs? It's a fact.
BETH: They're not "black", Elaine. The term du jour is African-American.
ELAINE: And what if they're from Jamaica, or like Bermuda.
SHERRY: Then they're BerMUDian-Americans. They all cringe and laugh.
ELAINE: So, why are you asking about the projects, Leigh.Anne? Another one of your charities?
BETH: A project for the projects. That's catchy. Money would raise itself. ( off their laughs ) Don't laugh. Count me in, Leigh
SI: It can't be that hard.
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah?. Si looks at the Michael's notebook.
SI: There are different parts of a sentence and you just have to draw lines showing what they do. Sean stops by the refrigerator for a cold drink while he talks on his cell.
SEAN: ( INTO CELL )
SJ: Dad, you remember how to diagram Sean starts to leave, then stops at the door, turns around, sighs and walks over. He leans in over Michael.
SEAN: Sean starts to leave, then stops at the door, turns around, sighs and walks over. He leans in over Michael.
MICHAEL: You don't have to help. ( off Sean's. look ) I mean if you're busy or somethin'.
SEAN: I know. ( points to page ) Think of a sentence like a football team. This is a noun here, see? That's like the team name or what they're known for - whether they're a running team or a passing team. And this is the verb. That's what makes 'em go - like a star player maybe a quarterback, maybe a running back. And this is an adjective - everybody oohs and ahs over adjectives but they're not as important as verbs.
SI: They're like wide receivers.
SEAN: Or kickers. Michael just stares at them.
MICHAEL: Not exactly. They all laugh.
NEARBY: Leigh Anne watches, fixated on the image of the three. Sean has an arm on Michael's shoulder. She smiles, almost sadly.
LEIGH ANNE: Do you want to stay here, Michael? He keeps working.
MICHAEL: I don't want to go anyplace else. She's a bit befuddled by the response.
LEIGH ANNE: Well,. alright then.
LEIGH ANNE: I see here on the admission that we're Michael's contact for medical Mrs. Smith ( from the admissions meeting ) sits with her.
MRS. SMITH: Sean wrote that in last week. We needed a contact number and the ones listed weren't in service.
LEIGH ANNE: Love that man. Leigh Anne pulls out another sheet, hands it over.
MRS. SMITH: The state makes schools measure for career aptitude in eighth grade. It came with his'file.
LEIGH ANNE: They try to figure out what a kid's going to be in the eighth grade? What does. it say about Michael? Mrs. Smith nods and reads over Michael's results.
MRS. SMITH: Doesn't look promising. Spatial relations - third percentile.. Ability to learn - fifth ( sees another number ) It's funny though. He tested in the 98th percentile in one Which one?
LEIGH ANNE: Which one?
MRS. SMITH: "Protective instincts." Leigh Anne smiles and hands the file back.
LEIGH ANNE: Yes, it is sad. So sad. But he either doesn't know it or doesn't think so and it's my job, and your job, to make sure he doesn't find ( off Mrs. Smith's look ) Michael Oher doesn't feel sorry for himself and I'll be damned if he starts to because of the way we treat him. ( again off her look ) 71 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - DAY 71 Now turned into Michael's room, with an armoire, a chest of drawers, night stands, the whole nine yards. The bed is a massive futon in an ornate stand. Leigh Anne and Michael stand in the doorway.
LEIGH ANNE: I had to put half my samples in storage but well, anyway, back there's a desk. ( points as she talks ) Chest o'drawers. Night stand. Lamps. Alarm clock. Bed. Sean says a lot of pro athletes use futons if they can't find a big enough bed. Michael doesn't dare touch anything, just stares in awe.
MICHAEL: It's mine?
LEIGH ANNE: ( off his look ) Never had one before.
MICHAEL: Never had one before.
LEIGH ANNE: ( CONFUSED )
MICHAEL: A bed. We can see this unsettles her. She turns away a bit, trying to contain herself.
LEIGH ANNE: Well, you got one now.
MRS. BOSWELL: Define Osmosis, Michael.
MICHAEL: I think I know that. It's when 76 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY ( LATER ) 76

SJ: Enough with the rugby shirts. You look like a giant bumble bee. Collins walks by with friends and glances but ignores them.
GIRL STUDENT: Who's the big guy hanging around with your little brother?
COLLINS: Just another one of Mom's projects.
GIRL STUDENT: That must get incredibly old. Collins' look says, "yes it does."
SI: That Taco Bell. The KFC catty corner. The Long John Silvers on the next block.
MICHAEL: You own all of 'ern?
SJ: Yeah. We've got hundreds.
COLLINS': ( CORRECTING )
MICHAEL: Is that why Mr. Tuohy don't have to go to work?
SEAN: Hey, hey now. I'm working even when I'm not working.
MICHAEL: And y'all eat at those places for All you want. It's awesome.
SI: All you want. It's awesome.
MICHAEL: What do y'all do with the leftover food? At the restaurant?,
SEAN: Well, we have to throw some of it away. What's already been cooked.
MICHAEL: That's too bad.
SEAN: Yeah, I'd rather sell it.
SI: Seems like you could give it away or something? You should check into that, Daddy. Leigh Anne and Sean share a look and a smile.
SEAN: All right, I will.
MICHAEL: Why ain't we eatin' at one of yours .Because tonight is a special I talked to Coach Cotton today. Michael's grades improved enough that he can do spring'training for football in March.
SEAN: .Because tonight is a special I talked to Coach Cotton today. Michael's grades improved enough that he can do spring'training for football in March.

LEIGH ANNE: I've got a design book I need to get. Sean, go check on our They'll seat us when we walk in the door. You can get the book after ( already walking away ) They might be closed by then.
SEAN: They'll seat us when we walk in the door. You can get the book after ( already walking away ) They might be closed by then.
LEIGH ANNE: ( already walking away ) They might be closed by then.
COLLINS: I need some new magazines. SJ shrugs and joins the girls, as does Michael. Sean watches as his family deserts him.
LEIGH ANNE: Come on, your dad's already PO'ed. Collins holds up a book. Sendak's WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE.
COLLINS: Remember this one, Mom? You read it to us like a thousand times. She softens, walks over, takes the book.
LEIGH ANNE: "And he gnashed his terrible teeth and roared his terrible roar.-
SI: I always liked this one. He holds up THE STORY OF FERDINAND.
LEIGH ANNE: Yeah, me too. Leigh Anne sees Michael left out, but interested.
SEAN: Now that was a good steak.
COLLINS: Thanks, Daddy.
MICHAEL: You're welcome. As the car pulls up everyone walks toward it except Michael who notices something else AT THE SIDE DOOR: A BUSBOY steps outside for a smoke. Michael absently walks over.
SEAN: You're welcome. As the car pulls up everyone walks toward it except Michael who notices something else AT THE SIDE DOOR: A BUSBOY steps outside for a smoke. Michael absently walks over.

MICHAEL: ( CONTINUED ) 86 CONTINUED: LEIGH ANNE
LEIGH ANNE: And how do you know Marcus?
MICHAEL: He's my brother. Complete silence in the car. Leigh Anne finally breaks it
LEIGH ANNE: Well, I'd like to meet him someday. Would that be okay with you?
MICHAEL: I don't know where he stays.
LEIGH ANNE: When's the last time you saw him, When I was little mebbe.
MICHAEL: When I was little mebbe.
A88: A88 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - SAME A strange sight. Leigh Anne, SJ and Michael all sit on Michael's huge futon as Leigh Anne reads THE STORY OF FERDINAND. No one enjoys this more than Leigh Anne.
LEIGH ANNE: ".and his name was Ferdinand. All the other little bulls he lived with would run and jump and butt their heads together, but not Ferdinand. He liked to sit just quietly and smell the flowers".
SEAN: LEIGH ANNE
LEIGH ANNE: Why are you smiling?
SEAN: Why are you smiling?
LEIGH ANNE: I don't know. I'm just happy. Really happy.
SEAN: Does. this happiness have anything to do with Michael?
LEIGH ANNE: No. It has everything to do with Sean smiles, kisses her, turns off the light. She snuggles next to him and kisses the back of his neck.
SEAN: He gets the message, rolls over and kisses her on the lips.
LEIGH ANNE: I think we should start a charity. For kids like him.
SEAN: ( his mind elsewhere ) Sure, okay.
LEIGH ANNE: Maybe fund a program at Wingate.
SEAN: LEIGH ANNE
LEIGH ANNE: Are you even listening to me?
SEAN: I try to concentrate on one thing at a time.
LEIGH ANNE: You knew I was a multi-tasker when you married me. She kisses him and they roll over, laughing.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, big smiles everyone! FLASH! Leigh Anne smiles but notices - Michael sitting on the couch by himself.
LEIGH ANNE: Michael! Come over here and get in the next one. Sean gives her a look like she's crazy.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, really big smiles. One, two, three. say Rebels!
LEIGH ANNE: Who's winning?

COUSIN BOBBY: Listen, I've had about five cold ones so'I'm just gonna go ahead and ask. Who's the colored boy in y'all's,Christmas Card?
ELAINE: It was like you were Jessica Lange and he was King Kong.
SHERRY: I taped your card to, the fridge. The next morning Frank almost gagged on his orange juice.
BETH: Does Michael get the family discount at Taco Bell? Because if he does Sean's gonna lose a few More laughter.
LEIGH ANNE: Look, he's a great kid.
ELAINE: I say just make it official and adopt him. Big laughs at the "crazy" idea.
LEIGH ANNE: He'll be eighteen in a few months. ( off their confusion ) So, I mean it wouldn't make much sense to legally adopt him, right? They realize she's thought about it and stop laughing. After an awkward beat of silence.
SHERRY: Is this some kind of white guilt thing, Leigh Anne? I mean charity's the Lord's work but.
ELAINE: What will your daddy say?
LEIGH ANNE: Before or after he turns over in his grave? Daddy's gone five years now, Elaine, and to make matters worse you were at the funeral. You wore Chanel with that awful black Before Elaine can attack
SHERRY: I'm so sorry, Leigh Anne. We didn't intend to
ELAINE: No, we didn't, really
BETH: I mean, what you're doing is so great. To open your home to him. You're changing his life. Leigh Anne smiles to herself, realizing.
LEIGH ANNE: No. He's changing mine.
ELAINE: That's awesome for you, but. what about Collins?
LEIGH ANNE: What about Collins?
ELAINE: Aren't you worried, even just a ( off Leigh Anne ) I mean he is a boy, a large, black boy, sleeping under the same roof. Leigh Anne stares at them, shakes her head then grabs the
LEIGH ANNE: I've got this. ( rises; to the group ) Shame on you. And strides away.
LEIGH ANNE: Be honest with me now, okay? Collins nods, having no idea what her mother is about to say.
COLLINS: They're stupid kids, who cares what they say.
LEIGH ANNE: What kids?
COLLINS: At school. They're juvenile.
LEIGH ANNE: And what do the juvenile kids say?
COLLINS: It's really not worth repeating. And don't worry about SJ - he loves the attention. He introduces Michael as his big brother.
LEIGH ANNE: What about you?
COLLINS: It's fine. ( off Leigh Anne's look ) I mean, you can't just throw him out on the street.
LEIGH ANNE: I can make other arrangements. ( off Collins' hesitance ) Just let me know. Okay?. Leigh Anne kisses Collins goodnight.
MICHAEL: Hi. Need a push? They giggle and Michael pushes them, one arm each until they're flying high and squealing.
NEARBY: Collins watches.
FRIEND: Where are you going? Collins walks away toward Michael.
COLLINS: Quit looking at me like that. I mean, we study together at home. Eyes in the library are on the pair as they start to read.
COTTON: You know how much those things weigh? This kid's gonna make us all famous.
SEAN: Easy, Bert. It's only the spring and he hasn't even been through his first practice.
COTTON: Okay, Mike, you fought off the block but you've got to shuck him and make the tackle. You got it?
NEXT PLAY: Michael gets down in a his stance and when the ball is snapped he gets under the blocker and lifts him up like WWF. The quarterback goes back to pass and sees Michael lumbering toward him with the lineman on his shoulders. The Quarterback's eyes go wide and he races out of the pocket and throws and incomplete pass. ANOTHER WHISTLE.
LEIGH ANNE: How's he doing?
SEAN: Doesn't quite have the hang of it SERIES OF SHOTS:
COTTON: Michael drops back and tries to intercept a pass.
COTTON: Most kids from bad situations can't wait to be violent and that comes out on the field. But this kid, he doesn't seem to wanna hit anyone.
LEIGH ANNE: ( almost to herself ) He's Ferdinand the Bull.
COTTON: LEIGH ANNE
LEIGH ANNE: I thought for sure he was gonna be a player. I can't believe I used up my chits to get him in school.
COTTON: I thought for sure he was gonna be a player. I can't believe I used up my chits to get him in school.
LEIGH ANNE: I thought you said it was your Christian duty? He gives her a smirk.
SEAN: Look, Bert, he's never even played And he won't in the fall if he doesn't improve a lot before then.
COTTON: And he won't in the fall if he doesn't improve a lot before then.
SI: This is your summer workout sheet. First it says to warm up and get ( off Michael's look ) Well, go ahead, get loose. Michael moves his arms around a bit then stops.
MICHAEL: Let's go home, play some video Look, everybody at. Wingate is expecting you to be a star football player. You don't want to let them down, do you?
SI: Look, everybody at. Wingate is expecting you to be a star football player. You don't want to let them down, do you?
MICHAEL: What about Dad and Mom? ( off Michael's look ) 'Cause you see, in our family, everyone's an athlete. Dad was a basketball star, Collins plays volleyball and runs track. Me, as you know, I do it all and Mom,. well, Mom was a cheerleader, which doesn't exactly count but don't tell her I said that.
SI: What about Dad and Mom? ( off Michael's look ) 'Cause you see, in our family, everyone's an athlete. Dad was a basketball star, Collins plays volleyball and runs track. Me, as you know, I do it all and Mom,. well, Mom was a cheerleader, which doesn't exactly count but don't tell her I said that.
MICHAEL: Michael moves to the line. Si raises his whistle and blows.
MICHAEL: Mrs. Tuohy? Michael stands nearby.
LEIGH ANNE: I hear "Mrs. Tuohy" I look over my shoulder for my motherin-law. Call me Leigh Anne or Mama or almost anything else.
MICHAEL: Will you help get me something?
LEIGH ANNE: Driver's license.
MICHAEL: Driver's license.
LEIGH ANNE: Why do you need a driver's license when you don't have a car?
MICHAEL: You have a car.
LEIGH ANNE: That I use to haul y'all all over creation with. He doesn't say anything but doesn't leave either. Leigh Anne puts down the swatches, turns to him..
MICHAEL: Something to carry. With my name on it. She locks eyes with him. This time he holds her gaze.
DMV EMPLOYEE: Is this his address as well?
LEIGH ANNE: Yes. He lives with us.
DMV EMPLOYEE: Are y'all his foster parents?
LEIGH ANNE: DMV EMPLOYEE
DMV EMPLOYEE: His legal guardians?
LEIGH ANNE: oh. no. The Employee does a search on the computer. As she types.
DMV EMPLOYEE: Does he have a Social Security Leigh Anne looks to Michael, who shakes his head.
LEIGH ANNE: We tried to find one for school, You don't know which city, which county, which hospital?.
DMV.EMPLOYEE: You don't know which city, which county, which hospital?.
LEIGH ANNE: How big a problem is this? DMV Employee looks to Leigh Anne.
DMV EMPLOYEE: There's nobody named Michael Oher in the system. Another last name Leigh Anne again turns to Michael, who shrugs.
LEIGH ANNE: Look, I'll sign something saying he lives with us and we'll pay for the insurance; whatever it takes. ( off her look ) What's it gonna take? Off the Employee's look
SEAN: You wanna do what?!
LEIGH ANNE: Don't pretend you didn't hear me.
SEAN: Shouldn't we at least talk about What do you think we're doing? And don't act like I'm going behind your back. I know you put us down as his medical contact at school.
LEIGH ANNE: What do you think we're doing? And don't act like I'm going behind your back. I know you put us down as his medical contact at school.
SEAN: There's a big difference between paying for a broken arm and being legally responsible for someone. Someone we barely know.
LEIGH ANNE: And that's another thing. We have to find out more about his past.
SEAN: He won't talk about it. He's like an onion; you have to peel it a layer at a time.
LEIGH ANNE: Not if you use a knife. What if we sent him to a child psychologist?
SEAN: Do you really expect Big Mike
LEIGH ANNE: MICHAEL -
SEAN: expect Michael to lie down and talk about his childhood like he's Woody Allen or something? Michael's gift is his ability to forget. He's mad at no one and doesn't really care what happened in the This puts her on her heels.
LEIGH'ANNE: You're right.
SEAN: ( like he's never heard
LEIGH ANNE: Like vinegar. She moves to him, holds him.
SEAN: LEIGH ANNE
LEIGH ANNE: "Alright" you'll think about it or "alright" we should do it?
SEAN: Is there a difference?
LEIGH ANNE: ( INTO CELL )
TO: She hangs up and, exasperated by the wait, rises and walks a counter, pushing past someone
EMPLOYEE: I'm sure you would. How can I help She turns to the man waiting behind her.
LEIGH ANNE: He was first.
EMPLOYEE: Me, too.
LEIGH ANNE: ( TO EMPLOYEE )
EMPLOYEE: Ma'am, you can tell me what you want or I'll make sure you wait all day. How. Can. I. Help. You?
LEIGH ANNE: I'd like to become a legal Lord look over that child.
EMPLOYEE: Lord look over that child.
RONALD: There's very little on Michael. Most of his files have been lost.
LEIGH ANNE: What is in there?
RONALD: A few case notes. ( holds one sheet up ) This one describes an incident where officers forcibly removed Michael and six half-siblings from Denise Oher's care when Michael was seven. Quite a scene evidently. They had to split up the kids. And it's far from the worst.
LEIGH ANNE: Where is she? His mother?
RONALD: Dunno, but if you find her we have a bunch more files we could add to.
LEIGH ANNE: How many children does she have?
RONALD: At least a dozen, probably more. With her drug arrest record my guess would be she can't even Leigh Anne absorbs this.
LEIGH ANNE: We'd need her permission though, No. Michael is a ward of the state. Just apply and get a Judge to sign off on it.
RONALD: No. Michael is a ward of the state. Just apply and get a Judge to sign off on it.
LEIGH ANNE: So you would give him away without even telling his mother? Ronald shrugs.
LEIGH ANNE: I'm looking for Denise Oher.
ALTON: Dee Dee don't stay there no more.
LEIGH ANNE: Do you know where she might be?
ALTON: Chances are she ain't gone far.
LEIGH ANNE: No, I can't, but thank you.
LEIGH ANNE: Hi. Mrs. Oher?
DENISE OHER: You from the state?
LEIGH ANNE: No. My. name is Leigh Anne Tuohy and your son Michael lives with me. And my family. Denise takes this in.
LEIGH ANNE: ( CALLS OUT ) ( CONTINUED ) 109 CONTINUED: 109
DENISE OHER: Awhile back. This is temporary. Friends let me stay here.
LEIGH ANNE: When did you last see Michael?
DENISE OHER: Iono. We might have some wine in the kitchen, if.
LEIGH ANNE: No, no that's very kind but.
DENISE OHER: How many foster kids you got living with you?
LEIGH ANNE: Oh, I'm not a foster parent to Michael. We were just helping him State don't pay you nothing?
DENISE OHER: State don't pay you nothing?
LEIGH ANNE: DENISE OHER
DENISE OHER: And he lives with you? ( Leigh Anne nods ) And you feed him?.
LEIGH ANNE: When I can find them in his size.
DENISE OHER: You a fine Christian lady.
LEIGH ANNE: I try to be.
DENISE OHER: This is all real nice what you're doing, but don't be surprised if one day you wake up and he gone.
LEIGH ANNE: What do you mean?
DENISE OHER: He's a "runner". That's what the state called him after they took him from me. ( off her look ) Every foster home they sent him to, he'd slip out the window at night and come looking for me. No matter where I was that boy would come find me, take care of me.
LEIGH ANNE: Mrs. Oher, was Michael born under a different name? Denise tries to remember. After a few seconds.
DENISE OHER: Proctor. That was his Daddy's last Where is he, the father, if you don't mind me asking?
LEIGH ANNE: Where is he, the father, if you don't mind me asking?
DENISE OHER: Ain't. seen him since he left.
LEIGH ANNE: And when was that?
DENISE OHER: Week after Mike was born.
LEIGH ANNE: Do you have Michael's birth Denise sighs, looks around at the mess, shakes her head. And then, unexpectedly, starts to cry softly.
DENISE OHER: No. Not this way.
LEIGH ANNE: People lose birth certificates. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
DENISE OHER: It's Williams. ( off Leigh Anne's look ) His last name's Williams. Couldn't even remember who the boy's father Leigh Anne bites her lip'and puts her arms around Denise, who hugs back.
SEAN: Michael, we have something to ask Leigh. Anne and I would like to become your legal guardians.
MICHAEL: Leigh. Anne and I would like to become your legal guardians.
SEAN: Leigh. Anne and I would like to become your legal guardians.
MICHAEL: What's that mean?
LEIGH ANNE: Well, what it means is, we want to know if you'd like to be a part of this family? Michael looks to a grinning SJ, to Collins who nods and smiles, then to Leigh Anne.
MICHAEL: I kinda thought I already was.
SEAN: Is that the one you wanted? He just stands there, staring. Sean hands him the keys.
SI: Can I go, too?
LEIGH ANNE: okay, but Michael?. ( off his look ) Be careful. Michael smiles and he and SJ get inside the truck.
COLLINS: He wanted a truck?!
SEAN: Michael thinks he's a redneck.
MICHAEL: Tenth grade tough?
STEVEN: ( points to truck ) This really yours?
MICHAEL: They just give it to ya'?
STEVEN: They just give it to ya'?
MICHAEL: After a beat.
STEVEN: You're right. white people are And they walk off together to class.
BOB: You are now seniors. Congratulations. But with that distinction comes responsibility. This will be one of your tougher courses because my job is to prepare you, at least most of you, for the rigors of college Freshman English. You are each holding a class study guide which details assignments. I won't remind you what is due and when. Read the materials and come prepared. At the end of the year you will each choose one of our literature assignments and present a written dissection of the piece. The faces in the classroom tell us this is a tough course.
SI: See, you're the ketchup, here at Left Tackle. On the weakside.
MICHAEL: I'm not that weak, SJ.
SI: it just means there are more blockers on the other side. It's a compliment, really.
MICHAEL: A compliment for a condiment.
SJ: ( CHUCKLES )
LEIGH ANNE: What is going on here?!
MICHAEL: Cinnamon just scored.
SI: We're going through the playbook. Michael got moved to offense..
LEIGH ANNE: Well, when you're finished, put the players back in the spice cabinet.
SJ: No problem. Actually, Mom, we were waiting for you. The new Madden came out and me and Michael want to go get it.
LEIGH ANNE: Honey, I've got a meeting in ten I'll drive. off her look
MICHAEL: I'll drive. off her look
SI: Look for Walker Street. That's where we take a left. Si finds a hip-hop station and they both groove to the beat, dancing in the seats.
LEIGH ANNE: This is not a twenty thousand dollar Oushak, Jerry. The borders are different widths, it's been Leigh Anne's phone rings. As she answers
LEIGH ANNE: He looks up, sobbing.
MICHAEL: I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!
LEIGH ANNE: Where's SJ?!
MICHAEL: ( POINTS )
SI: Mom, do you think the blood will come out of my shirt?
FIREMAN: An airbag deploys at 200 miles per hour. Your son's too small to sit in the front seat.
LEIGH ANNE: He's okay, though, right?
FIREMAN: Busted lip, some facial bruising. When an airbag strikes a child his size it usually means a fractured face, a broken neck or worse. It's almost like the airbag started at him then changed direction. Defective or something. Very, very Leigh Anne nods thanks and looks to Michael, still on the curb, eyes on the ground. She walks over, kneels down.
LEIGH ANNE: Michael, it wasn't your fault. It could have happened to anybody.. He doesn't look up. She almost gasps when she notices HIS ARM - red, bleeding, a large burn from the wrist all the way up to the sleeve, which is also singed.
MICHAEL: I stopped it.
COTTON: 0her! You've got a hundred pounds on Collis and you can't keep him out of our backfield?!
LEIGH ANNE: What's. with the camera?
SI: Michael does better when he can see what he's supposed to be doing.
COTTON: Holding - left tackle! He gets right in Michael's face, grabs his jersey.
NEXT PLAY: At the snap of the ball Michael tries to pass protect, pushes the Defender who tries left, right, then slides past Michael and sacks the quarterback.
LEIGH ANNE: Gimme a minute, Bert.
COTTON: We're in the middle of practice, Leigh Anne!
LEIGH ANNE: You can thank me later. Bert just watches as Leigh Anne walks straight to the huddle and pulls Michael aside. The other players turn to watch.
MICHAEL: Yes ma'am.
LEIGH ANNE: If anyone tried to get to me you would have stopped them, right?
MICHAEL: I stopped it. Leigh Anne points to the offense.
LEIGH ANNE: This team is your family. And you have to protect them ( points to defense ) from those guys. She walks over and grabs the QB, pulls him out.
MICHAEL: What about Mr. Tuohy and Collins?
LEIGH ANNE: I suppose they can be on the team, too. Are you going to protect the family, Michael? He nods. She nods back and walks away, past Bert Cotton.
COTTON: What'd you say to him?
LEIGH ANNE: You should get to know your players, Bert. He tested 98 percent in protective instincts. ( off Bert's look ) I told you you.could thank me ( a beat for effect ) It's later, Bert!
COTTON: ( BY ROTE )
SEAN: So much for home field advantage.
LEIGH ANNE: You ever seen so many rednecks in one place?
SJ: Nascar, not even close.
COTTON: On the schedule it says this is a home game but don't be deceived, gentlemen. Three fourths of the people in the stands are here from Milford. They'll be loud and rowdy and a lot of 'em drunk. Keep your helmets on 'til you're on the sidelines. I don't want anyone getting beaned with a whiskey Grab a knee. And the team huddles for their prayer.
MILFORD PLAYER: Hey, Crusaders, y'all gonna turn the other cheek or just bend over?! Another Milford player, #66, spots Michael.
MILFORD #66: Would y'all look at the size of that buck! Milford takes the field. Jay Collis, to Michael.
JAY COLLIS: Pay 'em back on the field. Coach Cotton raises a hand and the team moves forward to squeeze through an entrance onto the field. Above them Milford fans look down and jeer, toss sodas at them. The Blind Side Yellow Draft - 04/15/09 82
MILFORD DAD: Damn, that ain't fair! They got a big ole' black bear playing for 'em! What is this, a circus?!
LEIGH ANNE: SJ, eyes forward! Sticks and ON THE FIELD The ball is kicked off and Bobby, the Crusaders tailback takes it in at the five yard line. He makes one player miss then is dragged down by a swarm of defenders at the twenty.
COTTON: Let's go 0! Number 66 from before is the defensive end on Michael's side. Wingate breaks huddle and #66 sees him.
MILFORD #66: Look whose fat black ass I get to kick all night long. At the snap #66 sidesteps Michael and sacks the QB.
LEIGH ANNE: Come on, Michael!
REFEREE: Fourth down ! The crusaders offense leaves the field. #66 follows behind Michael, taunting him.
MILFORD #66: And don't come back unless you want me to embarrass your black ass!
COTTON: Get back to your own bench, 66! 66 laughs and struts away. Cotton goes straight to the ref.
REFEREE: Ever heard of the First amendment, Coach? Get back to the sideline. Cotton takes a deep breath, then turns to Michael, who has been beside him the whole time.
COTTON: Look, son, 66 is quick, so just focus on his belt buckle.
LEIGH ANNE: Enough with the trick plays, Bert. Just run the dang ball.
AND: Bert, on the field, turns to the stands, shakes his head hangs up angrily. Behind the Tuohys, the Milford fans are in a frenzy.
MILFORD DAD: That's my boy Jimmy, number 66. He is kicking that blue gum's ass! Leigh Anne can't restrain herself. She rises, turns
LEIGH ANNE: Hey crotch mouth! Yeah, you! Zip it or I'll come zip it for ya! Sean pulls her back down to her seat.
SI: Sticks and stones?
COTTON: It's all right. Settle down.
MILFORD #66: Big black pile of nigger crap! Cotton is nearby, hears this, races straight over to the Ref.
COTTON: Ref, you gonna do something about this?! He kicked my boy in the head and cussed him! The Ref throws a flag.
REFEREE: Unsportsmanlike conduct on Wingate! Fifteen yards. Shut up or you'll get another fifteen.
COTTON: What happened to the first Cotton throws his hat and another ref throws a flag.
MICHAEL: Don't worry, Coach. I got your Cotton cools down. Michael trots out onto the field. Halfway there he stops, looks back at Cotton and smiles.
REFEREE: Second and 38.
MICHAEL: Try Gap.
TONY: Coach called a pass.
MICHAEL: AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE As Wingate lines up, 66 is at it again.
MILFORD #66: Your coach always do your fightin' for you? He your Massa?- Michael gets in his stance and on the snap of the ball powers forward. We've never seen him so quick, neither has 66 who dips a hip to keep from being plowed over. The ploy rights 66 but the damage isn't over as Michael now has him "in the fit" grabbing his jersey, "between the tits." Bobby races through the hole and into the secondary Michael keeps pushing 66 back, picking up speed until 66 is airborne save every third step of Michael's when he touches a toe to the ground like a ballerina Bobby cuts to the sideline Michael is running full speed with 66 now and he keeps going past the sideline Past Collins and the rest of the cheerleaders while Bobby makes the opposite corner and heads for the end zone -
COLLINS: Way to go big bro! A referee signals touchdown then notices Michael walking back and 66 lying slumped at the fence. The Ref throws a flag.
COTTON: Now what?! Was he holding?
REFEREE: Uh, no.
COTTON: Did he hit after the whistle?
REFEREE: I don't believe so.
COTTON: Then what's the flag for?
REFEREE: I dunno. . Excessive blocking.
COTTON: You're kidding me. The Referee ignores and returns to the field to assess the penalty. 66, now on his feet, limps back onto the field. Michael looks at him and 66's eyes go straight to the dirt. Cotton walks up to Michael.
MICHAEL: Sorry, Coach. I stopped when I heard the whistle.
COTTON: Where were you taking him, Mike?
MICHAEL: To the bus. It was time for him to go home. Cotton smiles proudly and slaps Michael on the ass.
COTTON: Attaboy, Michael Oher. Attaboy!
LEIGH ANNE: See number seventy-four? Well, that's MY son.! The Milford fans don't know what to make of this. Leigh Anne sits down with a self-satisfied smile.
SECRETARY: Tom Lemming Recruiting, please hold. Tom Lemming Recruiting, please hold. And land on TOM LEMMING, the foremost college talent forecaster in the country.
SECRETARY: Coach Saban wants his Fed Exed.
TOM LEMMING: Does he really think getting it one day early is gonna give LSU a leg An ASSISTANT hurries up.
ASSISTANT: Have you filled all the slots for the Army All Star Game?
TOM LEMMING: Yeah, why? The assistant hands over the distinctive DVD marked MICHAEL
ASSISTANT: You might want to open one up.
TOM LEMMING: Every year there are a dozen running backs in the high school ranks who will make it to the NFL. Quarterbacks maybe three or four. But left tackles, true left tackles, they're freaks, gifts from the gods. A great one only comes around every four or five years. Mike's the best I've seen in ten.
COTTON: You're kidding?
TOM LEMMING: I don't kid about guys who'll get fifty million or more to play And you think that could be Oh, yeah. The embarrassing thing is it's my business to know every prospect in the nation but if you hadn't sent me that DVD I would have never heard of him.
COTTON: And you think that could be Oh, yeah. The embarrassing thing is it's my business to know every prospect in the nation but if you hadn't sent me that DVD I would have never heard of him.
TOM LEMMING: Oh, yeah. The embarrassing thing is it's my business to know every prospect in the nation but if you hadn't sent me that DVD I would have never heard of him.
SEAN: What DVD? I didn't send a DVD.
TOM LEMMING: You're Sean Tuohy, right? Sean "gets it", trades a look with Cotton.
SEAN: 128 INT. WINGATE - SEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 128 They arrive at an empty office where Michael sits. He stands and Lemming eyes him like a piece of meat.
TOM LEMMING: Wow. Just wow. Lemming breaks out a measuring tape and smiles.
COTTON: Tom Lemming runs the biggest recruiting service in the nation. He practically created an industry. Every college coach subscribes to his newsletter. One word from him and. This is big, Sean.
TOM LEMMING: Mike, I came all the way from Chicago just to see for myself. And now that I have, I'd like to extend to you an invitation to play in the Army High School All American game at the end of the He places an application on the desk. Michael stares at it.
TOM LEMMING: I don't want to offend but. does Mike have special needs?
SEAN: Well, he eats a lot.
TOM LEMMING: No, I meant, is he mentally. off?
SEAN: No, no, he's just.
COTTON: Shy. Really shy.
TOM LEMMING: Because the only thing he said to me was "No." Said it three times; every time I asked him if he'd like to play in the Army All Star game. I get lobbied by every player, every father, every coach to get into this game. ( hands over application ) Let me know if he changes his mind. Lemming walks away. After he's gone, Michael emerges.
SEAN: Why didn't you fill out the application, Michael?
MICHAEL: I don't wanna join the Army. Sean and Coach Cotton crack up.
PHIL FULMER: I want him! I want him bad.
LEIGH ANNE: Kick higher, Collins. Point your Leigh Anne notices Fulmer.
FULMER: Drove all the way from Knoxville to come see for myself. Leigh Anne slides in near the group so she can eavesdro
COTTON: Coach Fulmer, it's a real honor.
FULMER: Coach Cotton I been keeping an eye on your program. Y'all doing a fine job down here. Wouldn't be a bit surprised to see you coaching at the next level real soon. Cotton's smile tells us he'd like that a lot.
LEIGH ANNE: It's Oher. Like a paddle in a Fulmer notices Leigh Anne, grunts then turns back to Cotton.
FULMER: If you could run him through a few drills, we'd sure appreciate it.. .Cotton gives Leigh Anne a look that says, "get out of here." She shakes her head "I'm not going anywhere." Cotton blows his whistle and the team approaches.
COTTON: Board drill. Big Mike and Jay Collis. Best on best. An Equipment manager lays out a plank and Jay Collis sighs and lines up, one foot on either side of the board. Michael slowly moves into position opposite him. The coaches all inch closer and crane their necks to see. Leigh Anne is now right in the middle of them. Fulmer gives her a look that says,,"Who the hell are you?" Cotton blows his whistle, Michael fires out and it's over in an instant. Collis is pancaked under Michael, who gets up and offers a hand. The coaches are frozen - as if they've witnessed a miracle.
FULMER: ( almost to himself ) Force equals mass times Then, all at once, the coaches pull out their cell phones and start poking digits and jabbering: "You won't believe it!" "You gotta see this!" "He's a freak of nature!" The Clemson coach strides away.
COTTON: Where are you going, Coach?
CLEMSON COACH: Back to South Carolina. I've seen more than enough. If he can qualify with his grades you tell Michael Oher that Clemson wants him.
FULMER: Good luck with that, Brad! Fulmer smiles wide then turns to look once more at Michael.
LEIGH ANNE: Did you know that to be eligible for a Division One scholarship Michael's gonna need a 2.5 GPA?
SEAN: LEIGH ANNE
LEIGH ANNE: His ACT is low and I don't see him doing any better if he retakes it.
SEAN: What's his GPA now?
LEIGH ANNE: Not bad really, when you consider where he started.
SEAN: Not bad really, when you consider where he started.
LEIGH ANNE: He needs to make A's this year. ( off Sean's laugh ) I'm serious. And that might not even be enough.
SEAN: So he goes to Junior College.
LEIGH ANNE: Most inner city kids that go to JC drop out in a year. His shot at the pros would go out the window.
SEAN: Pros? Are we even sure he's gonna get college offers? She walks over to the answering machine, presses "Play."
SEAN: Phil Fulmer, from Tennessee?
LEIGH ANNE: There are twenty more. She holds up a stack of mail - envelopes and Fed Exes.
SEAN: Any from Ole Miss?
LEIGH ANNE: They won't recruit until they hire a new coach. But none of it matters unless he makes his grades.
SEAN: So, what do we do?
LEIGH ANNE: So here's the plan. E-mail me all assignments and let me know what Michael has to do to make an "A". There is laughter in the room.
MRS. BOSWELL: I think I know someone.
LEIGH ANNE: I understand that you applied for a teaching position at Wingate?
MISS SUE: I wasn't religious enough for 'em. I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy, but I have certain,. shall we say. I appreciate your honesty, Miss What's the situation with Michael?
LEIGH ANNE: I appreciate your honesty, Miss What's the situation with Michael?
MISS SUE: What's the situation with Michael?
LEIGH ANNE: He needs to do better in school.
MISS SUE: Obviously. But why the big push?
LEIGH ANNE: He's in line for a football scholarship if he gets his grades Is he considering Ole Miss?
MISS SUE: Is he considering Ole Miss?
LEIGH ANNE: He'd better be.
MISS SUE: I'd love to work with him.
LEIGH ANNE: When do you want to start?
MISS SUE: Mrs. Tuohy there's something you should know about me. I don't tell many people, but it's something I feel you should be aware of before you hire me.
LEIGH ANNE: What's that?
MISS SUE: I'm a Democrat.
MICHAEL: I don't understand it.
MISS SUE: Yet. You don't understand it yet. How big is your head, Michael?
MICHAEL: MISS SUE
MISS SUE: And what's in there?
MICHAEL: A brain.
MISS SUE: A brain. Full of knowledge - like a file cabinet with maps; shortcuts for figuring things out. You will learn this, Michael Oher because I'm here to help you use those maps and reach your destination. Like Sacagawea helped Lewis and Clark.
MICHAEL: MISS SUE
MISS SUE: We'll get to that. And the history books have it wrong, but all you need to you know is that I'll get you there. Do you believe me? Do you trust me, Michael?
MICHAEL: Yes, Miss Sue.
MISS SUE: Try it again. He goes back to the book.
SEAN: Who'd a thought we'd have a black son before we knew a Democrat.
NICK SABAN: And you must be Leigh Anne.
LEIGH ANNE: Yes, Coach Saban, that's me. Leigh Anne. Touhy.
NICK SABAN: Please, call me Nick. What an incredible home. Love the Windsor Thank you. You obviously have good Let's just say I appreciate Michael and SJ walk in.
LEIGH ANNE: ( VERY IMPRESSED ) NICK SABAN
NICK SABAN: Let's just say I appreciate Michael and SJ walk in.
LEIGH ANNE: Nick, why don't you and Michael go into the living room to talk.
MICHAEL: Can SJ come?
SABAN: Absolutely. I'll recruit the both of you. As they walk away, Collins approaches.
LEIGH ANNE: I find him extremely handsome.
SABAN: So, as soon as possible we'd like to get you down to Baton Rouge. We've got a great thing going, Michael and we plan on winning a bunch more National Championships. Whattaya' say, will you commit to a Michael turns to SJ, who raises his hand.
SI: Can I ask a question?
SABAN: My brother and me are very close. I'm worried that if he goes off to school I won't see him so.
SJ: My brother and me are very close. I'm worried that if he goes off to school I won't see him so.
SABAN: Go on.
SI: I guess I was just wondering how much access I'd have to him. Saban smiles at the kid's moxie.
SABAN: Tell you what, SJ. Michael comes to LSU I'll get you an all-access pass. How's that sound?
SJ: Sounds good.
MISS SUE: You know this stuff. Just be 150 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FOYER - DAY 150 HOUSTON NUTT walks in the Tuohy front door
NUTT: Hi, I'm Houston Nutt from Arkansas.
FULMER: This is a beautiful home, Ma'am. He is startled to see Michael, in briefs, racing down the stairs, carrying Collins, who is holding his pants away from him.
COACHES: Hi, I'm Tommy Tuberville.Hi, I'm Lou Holtz.
SI: What level of access can I expect?
TOMMY TUBERVILLE: Your own locker right next to Access to the Letterman's Lounge.
HOUSTON NUTT: Access to the Letterman's Lounge.
LOU HOLTZ: ( with a wink ) A Gamecock headdress. Real We'll run arm in arm onto the field and you can do the coin toss thingie at the first game.
PHIL FULMER: We'll run arm in arm onto the field and you can do the coin toss thingie at the first game.
SI: Sounds real good.
MISS SUE: Have you decided yet, Michael?
MICHAEL: No, Miss Sue.
MISS SUE: But you like Tennessee? ( off his nod ) It's a good school. Not at the academic level of Ole Miss but they do have an outstanding science department. You know one of the things they're famous for? ( he shakes his head ) They work with the FBI to study the effects of the soil on decomposing body parts. Michael is a bit lost.
LEIGH ANNE: Congrats on gettin' hired, Coach.
ED ORGERON: Thank yew, Ma'am. Ole Miss is my dream job.
LEIGH ANNE: Coach 0, you're coming a little late to the party but we're diehard Rebels so I'm gonna give you a frickin' road map, okay?
ED ORGERON: Yes 'm.
LEIGH ANNE: LSU is out. Everybody knows Saban's going to the NFL. So when he comes for his visit to Ole Miss, don't take him to some titty bar and give him tequila shots. He'll have nightmares for weeks. Feed him Italian - he likes Fettucine Alfredo - take him to a movie - but not Chainsaw massacre because he'll just cover his eyes - and put him to bed by ten. You got it?
ED ORGERON: Yes'm. What about Tennessee?
LEIGH ANNE: It breaks my heart but they're still in the hunt. Fulmer offered SJ a sweet deal.
ED ORGERON: I hear the kid can really pepper the gumbo.
LEIGH ANNE: He's his daddy's boy.
ED ORGERON: You a Ole Miss tackle, son. I'm buildin' my line, buildin' my team aroun' you. Make your parents proud, come to Oxford, get that sheepskin and help us win the SEC. Michael nods, turns to SJ. Before SJ can raise his hand
SI: ( "that's it?" ) Seen it a thousand times.
ED ORGERON: Ever seen it from the front of the line? Next year, you and me leading the team.
SI: Tennessee offered to let me run on the field and flip the coin.
ED ORGERON: I'll throw in a sideline pass. Si considers this, smiles and nods.
FULMER: This stinks to high heaven.
BOB: I will not give a student a grade he, or she, doesn't deserve.
LEIGH ANNE: He needs a B. What's he gonna have to do to "deserve" that?
BOB: Right now Michael's doing C minus, D plus work. His best chance at improving is with the written essay at the end of the year. It counts for a third of his grade.
LEIGH ANNE: That's it. We're sunk.
MISS SUE: Why not write about "Great Expectations"? You're a lot like Pip. He was poor, an orphan and someone sort of found him. You should be able to relate to that. Michael shrugs. Sean is nearby, watching NBA basketball.
SEAN: ( almost to himself ) "Half a league, half a league, half a league onward." I love that one.
MISS SUE: Fine, you do this and I'll watch Miss Sue walks over, takes the remote from Sean, who rises.
SEAN: "All in the valley of Death rode the six hundred". They call LSU's stadium Death Valley because of this story. Alfred, Lord Tennyson is writing about Ole Miss-LSU.
MICHAEL: You're kidding?
SEAN: No. It's a great story.
MISS SUE: It's a poem.
SEAN: "Forward the Light Brigade!" That's like the offense. "Charge for the guns'he said." That's the end zone. "Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred." He knows it by heart and even miss Sue is impressed.
MICHAEL: Someone made a mistake?
SEAN': Yeah, their leader, their coach.
MICHAEL: Why would they go ahead if they knew he messed up?
SEAN: "Theirs not to make reply, theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die: Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred."
MICHAEL: They all gonna die, aren't they?
SEAN: That's really, really sad.
MICHAEL: That's really, really sad.
SEAN: I think you just found something to write about. Michael opens his notebook, picks up a pen.
SEAN: LEIGH ANNE
LEIGH ANNE: ( off Sean's' look ) Michael's final GPA. Got it off Paul's computer. He did it, Sean. He did it! Sean grins, then.
SEAN: Wait a minute. You broke into the principal's computer?
SANDSTROM: Michael Jerome Oher. Even though no one is supposed to clap, a spontaneous round of APPLAUSE gives Michael pause as he accepts his diploma. Projected behind him is a picture of the cutest African- American infant the world has ever seen.
SEAN: Where'd you find a baby picture of Scanned it off an Internet ad for a toddler boutique. ( off his look ) Tell a soul and I'll rip your tongue out. IN THE CROWD: The Tuohys, Big Tony, Miss Sue, Bob and the other teachers all clap.
LEIGH ANNE: Scanned it off an Internet ad for a toddler boutique. ( off his look ) Tell a soul and I'll rip your tongue out. IN THE CROWD: The Tuohys, Big Tony, Miss Sue, Bob and the other teachers all clap.
SEAN: I want you to know something. You'n me, okay?
LEIGH ANNE: Excuse me young man, but I think I need a proper hug. He smiles and moves to her. Off their embrace
LEIGH ANNE: You'll be living in Deaton Hall here. You'll have a meal plan and you'll go to Johnson commons to Johnson Commons has all you can eat self-serve ice cream.
SEAN: Johnson Commons has all you can eat self-serve ice cream.
MICHAEL: As much as you want?
SEAN: Yep, that's how Mama put on her freshman ten. Leigh Anne rolls up a pamphlet and whacks him hard on her way to answer a RINGING PHONE.
LEIGH ANNE: Hello. This is Mrs. Tuohy. As she listens she gives Sean a look - "This isn't good". 184 INT. BUttDING HALLWAY - DAY 184 Leigh Anne walks with Michael.
LEIGH ANNE: They just want to ask you a few questions. You've got nothing to hide, Michael. They arrive at a door, open it.
GRANGER: Mrs. Tuohy? Mr. Oher? My name is Jocelyn Granger and I'm the Assistant Director of Enforcement for the NCAA.
LEIGH ANNE: Please call me Leigh Anne. Leigh Anne shakes her hand and she and Michael move to the Mrs. Tuohy, I'd prefer to speak with Michael alone.
GRANGER: Mrs. Tuohy, I'd prefer to speak with Michael alone.
LEIGH ANNE: How long will this take?
GRANGER: Michael starts rubbing his knees, nervous as hell.
LEIGH ANNE: Michael, I'll be outside. Leigh Anne pecks his cheek and exits, giving Michael one last look before she leaves.
LEIGH ANNE: I've got a bad feeling about this, Sean. This broad is tough. Oh,. Susie's on the other line.
GRANGER: Your parents are friends with Coach Bert Cotton, correct?
MICHAEL: Coach is a good guy.
GRANGER: Were you aware that Coach Cotton is accepting a job at Ole Miss? ( Michael shakes his head ) And that this job offer came after you signed with them? ( no response from Michael ) Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian went to Ole Miss.
MICHAEL: He played basketball.
GRANGER: And Mrs. Tuohy attended Ole Miss as She was a cheerleader.
MICHAEL: She was a cheerleader.
GRANGER: Is it safe to say that Ole Miss is their favorite school?
MICHAEL: They can't stand Tennessee.
GRANGER: So they wouldn't be happy if you chose to play football there?
MICHAEL: And your tutor.
GRANGER: And your tutor.
MICHAEL: Miss Sue.
GRANGER: Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too.
MICHAEL: What's that mean?
GRANGER: A booster is someone with an abnormal interest in a school's sports. Someone who-contributes financially to the University's athletic program. Michael doesn't answer, just keeps rubbing his knees. Then comes the part we've heard before.'
GRANGER: Do you know, do you understand why I'm here?
GRANGER: Yes. To investigate. I'm here to investigate your odd. predicament. Do you find it odd? Your predicament?
MICHAEL: she sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in. She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window, rubs his knees some more.
GRANGER: ( WITH FINALITY )
MICHAEL: What do you want, ma'am?
GRANGER: What I want, what my job is, is to discern whether something untoward occurred in your recruitment to Ole I want the facts. I need the I didn't lie.
MICHAEL: I want the facts. I need the I didn't lie.
GRANGER: I want the facts. I need the I didn't lie.
MICHAEL: I didn't lie.
GRANGER: And I want to know what you think about all this.
MICHAEL: THINK ABOUT WHAT?! It's the first time we've ever heard Michael raise his voice. It echoes in the room. Granger lets it die before she leans forward and continues.
GRANGER: The NCAA fears that with your recruitment a door might be opened that boosters from lots of schools in the south will become legal guardians for young athletes without means and funnel them to their Alma Maters. Michael still doesn't get it, shakes his head.
MICHAEL: ( almost to himself ) tutor all as part of a plan to insure that you played football for the University of Mississippi. Now Michael understands. He stares at the floor for a long time then quickly stands and makes for the door.
GRANGER: bought you a car and paid for a tutor all as part of a plan to insure that you played football for the University of Mississippi. Now Michael understands. He stares at the floor for a long time then quickly stands and makes for the door.
LEIGH ANNE: Michael, what's wrong? He looks at her, glares really; upset.
MICHAEL: Why'd you do it?
LEIGH ANNE: All along you wanted me to go to Ole Miss.
MICHAEL: All along you wanted me to go to Ole Miss.
LEIGH ANNE: Well, of course, but.
MICHAEL: Why did you do this for me?!
LEIGH ANNE: Everything! Was it for you or was it for me? Was it so I would go to school where you wanted?! Was it so I would do what you wanted?!
MICHAEL: Everything! Was it for you or was it for me? Was it so I would go to school where you wanted?! Was it so I would do what you wanted?!
LEIGH ANNE: No, Michael.
MICHAEL: ( points to building ) That's what she thinks! Is she ( her own words ) Don't you dare lie to me! Leigh Anne digests this, takes a breath.
LEIGH ANNE: Michael, look. I can see where, where some people might. Her inability, for the first time, to articulate, hits Michael in the face.
MICHAEL: I'm not stupid! He turns and walks away.
LEIGH ANNE: But she doesn't move, just watches him go.
LEIGH ANNE: ( on her cell ) Well if he comes by there let me know. Thanks.
COLLINS: ( ON PHONE )
LEIGH ANNE: Text him SJ.
SEAN: Keep it light. Tell him you're gonna take his truck for a spin if he doesn't get in touch. SJ starts texting. Leigh Anne and Sean stare at each other.
LEIGH ANNE: I should have followed him.
SEAN: You had no way of knowing he'd Was he right? ( off Sean's look ) What he said about us?
LEIGH ANNE: Was he right? ( off Sean's look ) What he said about us?
SEAN: Leigh Anne, be sensible. We gave clothes to a boy who had one pair of shorts. We gave him a bed. To hell with the NCAA, I'd do it again A191 CONTINUED: A191 What about the rest of it - all the stuff we did to make sure he got a scholarship? A scholarship to Ole He could go wherever he wanted, he knew that.
LEIGH ANNE: What about the rest of it - all the stuff we did to make sure he got a scholarship? A scholarship to Ole He could go wherever he wanted, he knew that.
SEAN: He could go wherever he wanted, he knew that.
LEIGH ANNE: Did he? Did you ask him? 'Cause I know for sure I never did. Sean considers this, then beckons.
SEAN: Come here, honey. She moves to him. He puts his arm around her, kisses her Am I a good person? ( off his look ) Not a joke. Not rhetorical.
LEIGH ANNE: Am I a good person? ( off his look ) Not a joke. Not rhetorical.
SEAN: You're the best person I know. Everything you do, you do for Why is that?
LEIGH ANNE: Why is that?
SEAN: ( with a smile ) I have not a clue. You obviously get some sick satisfaction from it. She looks at him. There's truth in his words.
LEIGH ANNE: Sean. what if he never comes 191 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - NIGHT 191 Michael makes his way toward Building "C", passing some of the same faces we've seen before.
ALTON: That you Big Mike? Get your ass in I'm looking for Moms.
MICHAEL: I'm looking for Moms.
ALTON: Your Mama? Oh, I seen Dee Dee around. She usually stop by for a taste around this time. Tell you what, I'll get you a forty and we'll chop it up 'til she get here. Michael hesitates. Alton smiles, beckons.
ALTON: It's good to see you, Big Mike. You lookin' fit. I heard you playin' some ball.
MICHAEL: But you know that rich kid football ain't like the public school league. People packing knives in their socks. Back in the day I was a quarterback. You knew that, right? At MLK.
ALTON: But you know that rich kid football ain't like the public school league. People packing knives in their socks. Back in the day I was a quarterback. You knew that, right? At MLK.
MICHAEL: Yeah, I heard.
JC?: He with me now! I'll open a spot for you, too.
DAVID: He with me now! I'll open a spot for you, too.
ALTON: He with me now! I'll open a spot for you, too.
DAVID: Got tired of going to class. Always somebody tellin' me what to do.
ALTON: Turn it up, bitch! David jumps up and cranks the volume on a RAP SONG until the beat is bouncing off the walls. Michael sips the beer; rubs his knees.
MICHAEL: She came here?
ALTON: She got any other kids? She got a You tap that? Michael sets down the beer, rises to leave.
MICHAEL: Shut up. Alton steps in front of Michael, raises his hands -
ALTON: Shutup?You tellin' me to shut up?I'llcap your fat ass. Cap yourass,drive east and pay a visittoyour Cracker Mama and her
SWEETLITTLE: Michael shoves him hard. Alton unprepared for the force, flies back against the wall. On the ground he reaches in his belt for his gun, but just as he gets it out Michael slaps it away. He picks up Alton and throws him across the room. The party comes unhinged as Michael grabs Alton, holds him against the wall with one hand while pounding him with the other. Blood flies from Alton's face - eighteen years of subdued rage coming out in seconds. TWO OTHER GUYS grab Michael from behind and one
ALTON: He gone. Leigh Anne stops, looks to Alton.
LEIGH ANNE: Michael was here?
ALTON: Last night. Sneaked me then took off like a little bitch. So you tell him, sleep with one eye open. Yod'hear me, bitch?' Leigh Anne steps closer to Alton, stares him down.
LEIGH ANNE: No, you hear me, bitch. You threaten my son you threaten me. You so much as cross downtown you'll be sorry. I'm in a prayer group with the D.A., I'm a member of the NRA and I am always packing.
ALTON: What you got in there, a .22? You got yourself a Saturday Night And it shoots just fine all the other days, too. She turns on her heels and strides to her car.
LEIGH ANNE: And it shoots just fine all the other days, too. She turns on her heels and strides to her car.
LEIGH ANNE: MICHAEL'S VOICE
MICHAEL'S VOICE: 201 EXT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY 201 Leigh Anne pulls up, stops and they lock eyes.
LEIGH ANNE: I'd imagine the last thing anybody at Hurt Village wants is cops snooping around. ( after a beat ) I swore I'd never ask but. how'd you make it out of there, Michael?
MICHAEL: When I was little and something awful was happening, my Mama would tell me to close my eyes.
LEIGH ANNE: You closed your eyes. He nods. She shakes her head, amazed at the kid. They stare out at the street, then.
MICHAEL: I'm pretty good at it.
LEIGH ANNE: Yeah, you are.
MICHAEL: Every game?
LEIGH ANNE: But I will not wear that gaudy orange of theirs because it's not in my color wheel.
MICHAEL: You want me to go to Tennessee?
LEIGH ANNE: I want you to go wherever you want. It's your decision, Michael. It's your life.
MICHAEL: What if I wanted to flip burgers? She takes this in, swallows hard and
LEIGH ANNE: Your decision; your life. Michael smiles.
MICHAEL: LEIGH ANNE
LEIGH ANNE: Okay, what?
MICHAEL: I'm sorry I left the other day.
GRANGER: You were pretty upset.
MICHAEL: You ask a lot of questions.
GRANGER: I'm trying to get to the bottom of But all the questions you asked were about why everybody else wanted me to go to Ole Miss.
MICHAEL: But all the questions you asked were about why everybody else wanted me to go to Ole Miss.
GRANGER: You asked about everybody but me. You never asked why I wanted to go Alright, fine, Michael. why do you want to go to Ole Miss?
MICHAEL: You asked about everybody but me. You never asked why I wanted to go Alright, fine, Michael. why do you want to go to Ole Miss?
GRANGER: Alright, fine, Michael. why do you want to go to Ole Miss?
MICHAEL: It's where my family goes to school. It's where they've always gone to school. Granger considers this, stares at Michael, then almost, just almost, smiles.
LEIGH ANNE: College is going to be a different experience for you. There are lots of distractions.
SEAN: Just have fun.
LEIGH ANNE: There'll always be some nimrod in the dorm who wants to play video games all night, or goof off on the You're gonna have a great time. I know I did. Leigh Anne gives Sean a look - "You're not helping."
SEAN: You're gonna have a great time. I know I did. Leigh Anne gives Sean a look - "You're not helping."
LEIGH ANNE: You'll spend lots of time at practice which means you have to be very dedicated to your studies.
LEIGH ANNE: Thank you, Miss Sue.
MISS SUE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sean and Michael and SJ eye a GROUP OF ATTRACTIVE COEDS sashaying past. SJ does a little dance move and laughs.
SEAN: Have a lot of fun. Leigh Anne notices their looks.
LEIGH ANNE: Michael Oher, you listen to me. I want you to enjoy yourself but you need to know that if you get a girl pregnant out of wedlock I will climb in the car, drive here to Oxford and cut off your penis.
SI: ( sotto: to Michael ) She means it.
MICHAEL: Yes ma'am. Leigh Anne gives Sean a look that says, "let's get on the road." Sean offers a hand; Michael shakes it. Collins high fives him. SJ offers a fist; Michael knocks it. Leigh Anne, tearing up, nods and gives Michael a quick hug.
LEIGH ANNE: The 78'll be a parking lot. We should go. She gets inside and closes the door for privacy. Sean, SJ, Collins and Michael stand there, watching her cry.
MICHAEL: Why does she always do that?
SEAN: She's an onion, Michael. You have to peel her one layer at a time. Michael walks over to the car, knocks on the window. She rolls it down, dabbing tears from her eyes.
LEIGH ANNE: I need a proper hug. She gets out of the car and holds him for a long time.
MICHAEL: I need a proper hug. She gets out of the car and holds him for a long time.
A209: As the family drives home from Ole Miss, we notice that Leigh Anne is very still. And very content. She closes her eyes.
