TONY: Like you guys have.
CHASE: Sure have.
TONY: Last summer.
CHASE: Last summer.

SENIOR GUY: True dat.
CHARLIE: You know what you should do? Join a band. That's all it takes, man.
MASON: Oh yeah?
CHARLIE: Fuck yeah, dude. You don't even have to play that well. I mean, you start playing your instrument, and they line up to give you blow jobs. Except for you. It doesn't impress the ladies so much when you play flute for the marching band.
TONY: I'm not in the fucking marching band.
SENIOR GUY: Ah dude, you sure? I heard you play the skin flute.
TONY: Alright, I got a question for you guys. If you think you're so cool, why are you hanging out with a bunch of eighth graders on a Friday night?
SENIOR GUY: Hey, fuck you, you little penis wrinkle. You know, you're lucky to even be here. This is our camp out. The only reason you little cum gums are here is because fucking Charlie's mom made him bring his little asshole brother, and then he drags along you little dice danglers. Fucking fuzz nut, talking shit!
CHARLIE: It's all good, man. These little fuzz nuts are going to get their chance soon enough. We got some whores coming by later.

MOM: ( to Mason and Samantha ) Hey, you guys made it! Good.
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS: And here you go, hostess.
MOM: Oh, thank you. Hey, can I get you a
COLLEGE GIRL: ( points to the mural ) Oh, that's cool.
MASON: COLLEGE GIRL
COLLEGE GIRL: You did that?
MASON: COLLEGE GIRL
COLLEGE GIRL: Wow. How long have you been doing that for?
MASON: Not very long. Um, I went to this camp thing just this past summer.
COLLEGE GIRL: They have a camp for graffiti?
MASON: Well, they call it "urban art".
COLLEGE GIRL: So it sounds, you know, less illegal, but. it was really just a way to get free spray paint.
MASON: So it sounds, you know, less illegal, but. it was really just a way to get free spray paint.
COLLEGE GIRL: Cool. So is this your tag? Is that do they still call it.?
MASON: Yeah, but you know, it's just letters that I'm good at writing.
COLLEGE GIRL: Oh. K.
MASON: COLLEGE GIRL
COLLEGE GIRL: E. Z. J. O. Kezjo. That's cool.
MASON: It doesn't really mean anything,
COLLEGE GIRL: Is that your dad?
MASON: COLLEGE GIRL
COLLEGE GIRL: Where's he live?
MASON: In Houston.
COLLEGE GIRL: Get to see him much?
MASON: Yeah, yeah. Some weekends, and over the summer.
COLLEGE GIRL: So you're a student of my mom's, Mm-hm. Yeah, she's uh, I got one class with her. Yeah, she's cool.
MASON: So you're a student of my mom's, Mm-hm. Yeah, she's uh, I got one class with her. Yeah, she's cool.
COLLEGE GIRL: Mm-hm. Yeah, she's uh, I got one class with her. Yeah, she's cool.
MASON: How's she doing? You know, is she is she a good teacher and everything?
COLLEGE GIRL: Yeah! She's great. She's super smart and she cares, you know, she makes it interesting. She's probably even my favorite teacher.
JIM: .So anyway, we figured out a way to rig up our iPods to the external speakers on the ASV. So every time we come rolling into town, you knew the 456 was there, 'cause we were bumping House of Pain. It was like, "Jump around, Jump around." And the whole family's coming outside, and you got the kids and the mom and the dad, and they're all bouncing up and down. We're throwing out candies for the kids, and soccer balls, and Beanie Babies, and Frisbees. Um, like, smokes for the adults. And they loved, they absolutely loved, Gatorade. But for some reason, you know, they hated the lemon-lime flavor. I don't know what it was. Yeah. Couldn't give it away.
MOM: How long were you over there?
JIM: Uhh. I did two tours in Iraq and one in Bosnia.
MOM: Did you enlist?
MASON: Did you enlist?
JIM: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I was, um, Army National Guard. And, uh, you know coming straight out of high school. Needed money for college. Seemed like a decent paying job. And, uh, did my tour. And whenever I got done, I told them if there's, you know, a world-changing event, I'll come back. And, uh, 3 months later 9/11 happened. And I was back 9/12. And I'm proud to say the 456, the whole time we were there, we never lost a guy. Not one casualty.
MOM: But is that odd? Is that unusual?
JIM: Yeah. Almost impossible. Like the guys that came along after us and replaced us, they didn't listen to any of our advice. They, you know, did basically the polar opposite of what we did, and they lost seven guys in the first month.
MOM: Wow. What did you guys do Well, I'd like to think it's just a matter of mutual respect, you know. I mean, all the time we spent over there building trust, I mean these guys basically destroyed it in three
JIM: Well, I'd like to think it's just a matter of mutual respect, you know. I mean, all the time we spent over there building trust, I mean these guys basically destroyed it in three
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS: So, what did the locals think about why we were there?
JIM: Oil. Plain and simple.
CHASE: Hey, Mason. One last hit.
CHARLIE: ( in the driver's seat ) Hey! Mickey Mouse Club. Get the fuck out of my car. Just crawl out the back window or something, man.
BLONDE GIRL: I'm gonna miss you.
MASON: I'll see you on Sunday night.
BLONDE GIRL: Alright. You better text me.
MASON: Mm. Do you have any gum?
BLONDE GIRL: Um. yeah, I do, actually. Here you go.
MASON: Thanks. See ya.
MOM: .And they're buying this party line that they're supposed to feel bad and trade off their own pension, as if that's what's corrupting this Yeah, because those who hear Fox, in my opinion, are being lied to.
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS: Yeah, because those who hear Fox, in my opinion, are being lied to.
MOM: Yeah, thank God for Wisconsin. I mean, we have to follow that example.
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS: You're right.
JIM: Hey, Mason. What time is it?
MASON: Uh, like 12:15.
JIM: Happy birthday.
MOM: Huh! Happy birthday!
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS: Mason, it's your birthday?
MASON: Uh, just now, I guess.

DAD: Yeah, no. But I had to sell that You what?
MASON: You what?
DAD: Yeah, I had to sell that.
MASON: So. so it's gone?
DAD: Yeah, some sucker collector from California paid twenty-two grand for it, which is great 'cause I basically got to pay for this in cash. I only paid eighty-five hundred for that thing way back when. I mean, you know, cars are generally a terrible investment. You know? Soon as you drive them off the lot you got a used car on your hands, and the value's only dropping from there.
MASON: You don't remember?
DAD: Remember what?
MASON: Really? You said that was going to be my car when I turned sixteen.
DAD: ( laughs ) What? No, I didn't. I never said I remember. I was in third grade and you were taking me over to Anthony Nagar's house for his birthday. and we were there early, so we gave him a ride around the block. And he was talking about how much he loved your car and so you were all like "Oh. This is going to be Mason's when he turns 16."
MASON: I remember. I was in third grade and you were taking me over to Anthony Nagar's house for his birthday. and we were there early, so we gave him a ride around the block. And he was talking about how much he loved your car and so you were all like "Oh. This is going to be Mason's when he turns 16."
DAD: What are you..? Alright, first off, I have no memory of that, alright? Second of all, I would never say that. Never.
MASON: Yeah. You did though.
DAD: What? Mason. Come on, what about your sister? I'm just gonna forget about her? Come on, how's that fair? Huh? Anthony Nagar, what the?
ANNIE: Does your mom actually let you watch Yeah. She likes it too.
SAMANTHA: Yeah. She likes it too.

ANNIE: Yeah, babe.
DAD: Alright. This one, this one needs a little explanation, okay? Open it up. I call that "The Beatles' Black Album". Alright, what it is, is the best of John, Paul, George, and Ringo solo, post-break up.
MASON: Yeah, basically, I put the band back together for you.
DAD: Yeah, basically, I put the band back together for you.
MASON: I don't know. I think I always just liked Paul the best.
DAD: It doesn't matter, you know, you're missing the point. There is no favorite Beatle! That's what I'm saying. It's in the balance. That's what made them the greatest fucking rock band in the world. Okay? You know, and there's this decade of music out there that's been scattered. And now it has been carefully found, arranged, and ordered for you, by your loving father.
ANNIE: Very arranged and very organized, over and over again by your loving Yes, yes, yes. So, I mean, look at that look at that, uh, top of Volume II, first four tracks. You've got "Band on the Run" into "My Sweet Lord", into "Jealous Guy", into "Photograph". I mean, come on. It's like the perfect segue. You got Paul, who takes you to the party, George who talks to you about God, John who says no, it's about love and pain, and then Ringo who just says hey, can't we enjoy what we have while we have it? It's a good record. I shit you not.
DAD: Yes, yes, yes. So, I mean, look at that look at that, uh, top of Volume II, first four tracks. You've got "Band on the Run" into "My Sweet Lord", into "Jealous Guy", into "Photograph".

PREACHER: "I won't believe it until I put my finger into his side and I'm gonna see those nail prints in his hands." Poof! About that time, here comes Jesus, standing right next to him. Okay? And he turns to Thomas. Don't you know Thomas felt some shame? And he turns to Thomas and says, "Thomas, here, stick your finger in my side. Look at these nail prints. It's me." And Thomas says, "My Lord, and my God, I believe."

TURLINGTON: Completed your, uh, digital contact Not quite, but. I mean, it's not gonna take me long.
MASON: Not quite, but. I mean, it's not gonna take me long.
TURLINGTON: Not yet. Not quite. Darkroom time is extra-curricular. I mean technically, you don't ever have to be in here these days, and certainly not until you've completed your assignments. That's the deal.
MASON: I'm worried about you, Mason.
TURLINGTON: I'm worried about you, Mason.
MASON: Why is that?
TURLINGTON: I'll tell you why. The images you're turning in, they're cool. You're looking at things in a really unique way. Got a lot of natural talent.
MASON: Yeah, but, that and fifty cents will just get you a cup of coffee in this old world. I've met a lot of talented people over the years. How many of them made it professionally without discipline, commitment, and a really good work ethic?
TURLINGTON: Yeah, but, that and fifty cents will just get you a cup of coffee in this old world. I've met a lot of talented people over the years. How many of them made it professionally without discipline, commitment, and a really good work ethic?
MASON: No, but I mean the things you're talking about, like work ethic or whatever, I feel like I do work pretty hard. I spend the whole weekend taking pictures a lot of times.
TURLINGTON: You like football, Mason?
MASON: Not really.
TURLINGTON: Yeah, I know you don't. That's why I've just assigned you to shoot the football game tonight. Okay? It starts at 7:30. I want you to get there early. I want you to shoot a full card, three hundred images, and I want 'em downloaded, I want 'em sorted, and I want to see them very first thing Monday. Okay? You want to know why I'm doing this?
MASON: I guess.
TURLINGTON: Who do you want to be, Mason? What do you want to do?
MASON: I want to take pictures. Make art.
TURLINGTON: Any dip-shit can take pictures, Mason. Art, that's special. What can you bring to it that nobody else can?
MASON: That's what I'm trying to find out.
TURLINGTON: Try harder. Hey, maybe in twenty years you can call old Mr. Turlington and you can say, "Thank you, sir, for that terrific dark room chat we had that day." Get back to class and do your work.
NICK: Hey man. You're walkin' a little Fuck you.
MASON: Fuck you.
NICK: I'm just saying, you guys were in there for a long time. Just hope he bought you dinner first.
MOM: Mason! Honey, come down for dinner.

MOM: I do. We're what you call house poor. Everyone's got to do their part. Your brother took the pictures. You have to help.

JIM: Last summer it was the earrings, and now the nails. You got a, uh, you got a purse to go with all that?
SAMANTHA: A lot of guys do that. He's just trying to be cool.
JIM: When I was in high school, having a job, being responsible, being able to afford a car, that was cool.
MOM: Mason, honey, why don't you get you and your sister some water.
NICK: Hey man, Turlington says to cut the artsy crap and shoot the game. So take your lens and point it that Jesus Christ.

NICK: Shoot the game.
GABY: Oh! First one. What was that? What was that? What is up?
SHEENA: Hey, what's up?
MASON: Hey. How's it goin'?
SHEENA: Pretty good. How long have you been I don't know. Awhile, I guess.
MASON: I don't know. Awhile, I guess.
SHEENA: Awhile? Yeah.
MASON: I just feel like there are so many things that I could be doing and probably want to be doing that I'm just not.
SHEENA: Why aren't you?
MASON: I mean, I guess it's. just being afraid of what people would think. You know, judgment.
SHEENA: Yeah. I guess it's really easy to say, like, I don't care what anyone else thinks, but, everyone does, you know? Deep down.
MASON: Exactly. I find myself so furious at all these people that I'm in contact with just for controlling me or whatever, but you know, they're not even aware they're doing it.
SHEENA: Yeah. So. in this perfect world where no one's controlling you, what's different? What changes?
MASON: Everything. I mean, I just wanna be able to do anything I want, because it makes me feel alive. As opposed to giving me the appearance of Whatever that means.
SHEENA: Whatever that means.
MASON: I don't think it means much.
SHEENA: You're kinda weird, you know that?
MASON: ( MORE ) MASON ( CONT'D ) ( Laughing )
SHEENA: I don't know. Do you wanna be weird?
MASON: I mean, I don't want to like. scare kids at the park, or anything like
SHEENA: So, why're you trying with me?
MASON: I don't know. I guess I feel I'm glad.
SHEENA: I'm glad.
MASON: Hey, Jim. I'm sorry I'm so late.
JIM: What time were you supposed to be I don't know. Awhile ago.
MASON: I don't know. Awhile ago.
JIM: Awhile ago like, thirty minutes ago, an hour ago? Cause, truthfully, nobody even knew where you were until your sister told us. She's been home for awhile.
MASON: I'm sorry.
JIM: Yeah, been hearin' a lot of that lately. See, but you don't actually care. You just kinda. kinda come and go as you please and you don't care if your mom's upset or what time you gotta be home. Is that what's up?
MASON: I don't know what to tell you.
JIM: Stop mumbling! You know, speak up! I can't understand a word comin' outta your mouth. It's just like, "uh uhh nuhh" and I ask you questions and you just
MASON: Man, can I just have one day where everyone isn't all over my ass!?
JIM: I'm up your ass? This is my house. Now, if you wanna live in my house then you get home when you say you're gonna be home.
MASON: You know, Jim, you're not my dad.
JIM: No, I'm not your dad! You know how I know that? Cause I'm actually here. I'm the guy with the job, paying the bills, taking care of you, your mom, your sister. Huh?!
MASON: Morning. Hey, which one of you guys used the downstairs bathroom last I don't know. I didn't.
MOM: Morning. Hey, which one of you guys used the downstairs bathroom last I don't know. I didn't.
MASON: I don't know. I didn't.
MOM: That tall guy, what's his name?
MASON: Yeah, Phillip. He did it. Can Phillip read? I mean, there's a big sign on the door, it says, "Do not use this bathroom, it's broken." I mean, how difficult is that?
MOM: Yeah, Phillip. He did it. Can Phillip read? I mean, there's a big sign on the door, it says, "Do not use this bathroom, it's broken." I mean, how difficult is that?
MASON: I don't know. I'm sorry.
MOM: I think I'm gonna put the house on the market.
MASON: This house is too big for us. I mean, you're going to school eventually. It's too expensive. I'm done.
MOM: This house is too big for us. I mean, you're going to school eventually. It's too expensive. I'm done.
MASON: Well why did you even buy it in the first place, then?
MOM: Because I really enjoy making poor life decisions, keeping us on the
MASON: Really? Like what?
MOM: Like - Well, I got rid of a couple husbands, now I'm gonna get rid of a mortgage, some maintenance, the tchotchkes, the, the homeowner's insurance, the property tax, the plumbing. Ahhh. You know what? From now on I am gonna be Mommy Monk. Simple. Celibate.
MASON: Don't be gross, Mom.
MOM: Fine. I'll be a poor whore with a big house. Is that better?
MASON: Mason starts to walk away.
MOM: Mason Mason, please, don't leave me that dirty dish to wash.
MASON: I do dishes all day.
MOM: Well, great honey, then you're a professional. Come on, you could do one or two more for you poor old
MASON: Thank you.
MOM: Thank you.
MASON: You want one?
APRIL: Ugh. God
MASON: ( Laughing ) She didn't even touch them, seriously. I watched her the whole time.
APRIL: Yeah, I bet you did watch her, you little pervert. It's like we're on a date. Cheers.
MASON: It's a night of romance.
APRIL: Yeah, except I'm not gonna kiss you.

MASON: Enrique is not here. I'm tryin'.
MR. WOOD: Well, while you're tryin', we're dyin'! What am I supposed to tell my customers? "Oh, I'm sorry that your table's got dirty plates on it, but Mason's tryin'. Least that's what he told me, after he was flirtin' with April and eatin' your leftover shrimp." Now it is a challenge out there today, I know, but I wanna share somethin' with you, I got you pegged for fry cook this summer, now that's a lot more responsibility. It's also more money. How's that I know you can handle that money. but can you take the responsibility? I think you can, because I believe in you. But I need you on the floor. Now leave the dishes. Giddyup. Right, come on, don't let me down!
MASON: MR. WOOD
MR. WOOD: I know you can handle that money. but can you take the responsibility? I think you can, because I believe in you. But I need you on the floor. Now leave the dishes. Giddyup. Right, come on, don't let me down!

DAD: yet? Did you get that application in to UT?

MASON: way in this life, alright?
DAD: way in this life, alright?
MASON: How's that goin'?
DAD: How's that goin'?
MASON: Today kind of sucked, this guy didn't show up. But it's definitely an interesting perspective on the world. People are slobs.
DAD: ( Laughing ) Well, when people ask me about you I say, "Oh, Mason, he's doing great. He's got a job, he's really cleanin' Mason laughs.
ANNIE: Say hi to your big brother. Hey, big brother.

MASON: I'm just kidding. I have work.
MOM: I'm just kidding. I have work.
MASON: I will.
MOM: Have fun!
SHEENA: . That sounds to me like just another extreme Mason view of Not at all! I finally figured it out. It's like when they realized it was gonna be too expensive to actually build cyborgs and robots. I mean, the costs of that were impossible. They decided to just let humans turn themselves into robots. That's what's going on right Oh, right now?
MASON: Not at all! I finally figured it out. It's like when they realized it was gonna be too expensive to actually build cyborgs and robots. I mean, the costs of that were impossible. They decided to just let humans turn themselves into robots. That's what's going on right Oh, right now?
SHEENA: Oh, right now?
MASON: Yeah! I mean, why not? There are billions of us just laying around, not really doing anything. We don't cost anything. I mean we're even pretty good at self-maintenance and reproducing constantly. And as it turns out, we're already biologically programmed for our little cyborg Seriously. I read this thing other day about how, like, when you hear that ding on your inbox you get a, like a dopamine rush in your brain. It's like we're being chemically rewarded for allowing ourselves to be brainwashed. How evil is that? We're fucked.
SHEENA: Seriously. I read this thing other day about how, like, when you hear that ding on your inbox you get a, like a dopamine rush in your brain. It's like we're being chemically rewarded for allowing ourselves to be brainwashed. How evil is that? We're fucked.

SHEENA: So you deleting your Facebook page is gonna change all that? Remember when Trevor deleted his Facebook page last year and everyone just hated him? You made more fun of him than anyone.
MASON: I still make fun of Trevor, though.
SHEENA: But it looked like he was so pathetically desperate for attention. Or to be different, or something.
MASON: That's just 'cause they did that lame story about it in the school And then he had to make a big announcement about it when he came back a month later.
SHEENA: And then he had to make a big announcement about it when he came back a month later.
MASON: That's the thing though, I'm not doing it for attention. I just want to try and not live my life through a screen. I want, like, some kind of actual interaction. A real person, not just the profile they put up.
SHEENA: Oh, I'm sorry. Were you saying
MASON: Yeah, okay, I know you're joking, but, I mean, it's kinda true you have been, you know, checking your phone this whole time, and so what are you really doing? You don't care what your friends are up to on Saturday afternoon but you're also obviously not fully experiencing my profound bitching so. it's like everyone's just stuck in, like, an in-between state. Not really experiencing anything.
SHEENA: It's not an experience, it's just information. Look, for example, I just got the address of the club where we're meeting them later, so we won't be wandering the streets of Austin lost for an hour tonight. Thank you very much, Facebook. And I just texted my mom back.
MASON: Oh, that's that's groundbreaking. She hasn't seen you in, like, 55 Oh! Oh my god, most importantly, Meg's family just got a miniature pet pig.
SHEENA: Oh! Oh my god, most importantly, Meg's family just got a miniature pet pig.
MASON: ( looks at phone photo ) ( Laughs ) Okay, you're right. That is a
SHEENA: That is a really cute, tiny pig. Our lives can go on.
MASON: That is a really cute, tiny pig. Our lives can go on.
SHEENA: I want one.
BOYFRIEND: Nice shot.
SAMANTHA: Yeah, just give the lady at the front y'all's I.D.s and, uh, she should let you in.
SHEENA: I see. Cool.
SAMANTHA: It's room 2-0-6, right?
SHEENA: It's room 2-0-6, right?
SAMANTHA: Awesome. It's not like weird that we're staying there?
SHEENA: Awesome. It's not like weird that we're staying there?
SAMANTHA: No, it's fine. Have fun.
SAMANTHA: About three months. Yeah, we met at a party and it's been, ya know, chill.
SHEENA: Yeah, he seems cool.
SAMANTHA: Yeah. He is.
SHEENA: Cool. What is he studying?
SAMANTHA: He's studying history and uh, Italian, I think?
SHEENA: Does he wanna. does he wanna teach?
SAMANTHA: I don't know, I think, I think he's still figuring stuff out. Yeah, he'll figure it out, he's smart, he's smart. So where are you thinking about living when you come here?
SHEENA: Um, I'm not really sure yet. We're gonna look at apartments tomorrow, um, but I know my parents sorta were expecting me to live in a dorm.
SAMANTHA: Yeah. But I mean, I'm paying my way through college, so it doesn't really matter that much.
SHEENA: Yeah. But I mean, I'm paying my way through college, so it doesn't really matter that much.
SAMANTHA: Yeah, you don't have to listen to your parents after you turn eighteen. I mean, especially if they're not helping you financially.
SHEENA: That's what I figured.
SAMANTHA: But I mean, living in a dorm isn't so bad.
SHEENA: I mean especially if it's a coed dorm. I mean, I've never been around like, so many cute guys at once. Like, college is really fun.
SAMANTHA: I mean especially if it's a coed dorm. I mean, I've never been around like, so many cute guys at once. Like, college is really fun.
SHEENA: I'm excited.
SAMANTHA: It's great, yeah.
BOYFRIEND: Watch out.
SAMANTHA: They laugh.
MUSICIANS: ( singing ) "On the day that I was born I started growin' old. No one told you life would be so lonesome and cold. I had a grey hair by the age of 23, this hard-luck livin's gonna be the end of me. The old black crow leaving tracks all across my face, and everywhere I go I seem to be in the same damn place. Hard livin's gonna be the end of me."
SHEENA: See those sorority girls over there? I've just decided, if you delete your Facebook page, I'm pledging.
MASON: Yeah, in just a few years that's you And that's gonna be me.
SHEENA: Look at all these people. What are they even doing here at 3:00 in the What are WE even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?
MASON: What are WE even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?
SHEENA: We know what we're doing here.
MASON: Hell yeah.
SHEENA: HELL yeah.
MASON: You know, by, like, next summer this'll just be our lives.

SHEENA: When it feels right. When the inspiration hits.
MASON: Only then.
WAITRESS: Anything else?
SHEENA: Uhhh. more queso?
MASON: ( nodding )
WAITRESS: She leaves, and Mason just takes it all in.
MASON: Ah, Jesus.
SHEENA: I don't know, doesn't it all seem a little overwhelming? I mean, college? I mean, I like the idea of being away from home and gaining skills and getting better at photography. I just, I don't know, I'm not counting on it being some big transformative I don't think it's that transformative. I just see it as the next step.
MASON: I don't know, doesn't it all seem a little overwhelming? I mean, college? I mean, I like the idea of being away from home and gaining skills and getting better at photography. I just, I don't know, I'm not counting on it being some big transformative I don't think it's that transformative. I just see it as the next step.
SHEENA: I don't think it's that transformative. I just see it as the next step.
MASON: But it's like a pre-ordained slot that's already got your name and number on it. I don't think it's the key to my future. Cause, like, I mean, look at my mom. She got her degree, and got a pretty good job, she can pay her bills.
SHEENA: Well, I like your mom.
MASON: Well, I like my mom, too. I just mean, basically, she's still just as fucking confused as I am.
SHEENA: ( to Waitress ) Thank you.
MASON: Mason and Sheena dip chips into the bowl of queso.

MASON: Good luck. Don't forget to floss.
TEACHER: Good luck. Don't forget to floss.
SHEENA: I just don't get why you're being so fucking childish.
MASON: I'm not being childish. You're the one who made it into this big thing by telling everyone.
SHEENA: I haven't told anyone.
MASON: So Cynthia just magically knows you're going to the prom with this loser even though you're not dating him She's my best friend.
SHEENA: She's my best friend.
MASON: Well, your best friend has a big fucking mouth.
SHEENA: Take it up with her, then.
MASON: Why don't you just tell Miss Fuckin' Rubber Jaws she can keep on talking as long as she includes the truth, which is that we wouldn't be having this conversation if your college boyfriend weren't out of town this You had already bought the tickets. It's just prom, it's not like it matters. I'm just tryin' to be friends with you.
SHEENA: You had already bought the tickets. It's just prom, it's not like it matters. I'm just tryin' to be friends with you.
MASON: Now it's just humiliating. I can't. I can't do that.
SHEENA: Mister I-Don't-Care-What-Anyone-Else- Fuck anyone else. I care what I think of me. Which isn't much right now. King of the Pity Prom.
MASON: Fuck anyone else. I care what I think of me. Which isn't much right now. King of the Pity Prom.
SHEENA: Fine. We're not going.
MASON: A long pause.
SHEENA: knew this was coming. I'm just the one who did something about it.
MASON: ( a beat ) I don't regret anything.
SHEENA: ( a beat ) I don't regret anything.
MASON: ( Bitter Laugh ) Of course you don't.
SHEENA: relief not to have to be around someone who's so gloomy all the time. The world's not so horrible. Not everything's some big conspiracy against humanity.
SHEENA: happens to be on the lacrosse team. We're all going to other schools next year anyway, it's not some super serious relationship.

MASON: anyone else.
SHEENA: anyone else.

SHEENA: What do you care?
MASON: What do you care?
SHEENA: Does it matter?

MASON: Doesn't the apartment have like an attic, or storage or something?

SAMANTHA: Can't believe we're moving again.
MOM: No, I'm moving! You moved two years ago. You have an apartment in Austin. Mason is moving the fall. I'm done. This will be great for me. I'll have all these options. I could take a sabbatical. I could get some writing done and try to get published.

SAMANTHA: I'm not sharing a room with him.
MOM: One of you will sleep on the couch, and we'll use that blow-up mattress.

ERNESTO: Hi guys. I'm Ernesto, how are you? Uh, you probably don't remember me, but I worked on your septic line years ago.
MOM: Oh, yeah.
ERNESTO: Believe it or not, you changed my life. Yeah, you told me that day that I was smart and that I should go to school. I took your advice! I signed up for English classes and then a year later I went to community college and I got my associates degree. And I'm working on my bachelors now at Texas State. And I'm also one of the managers here.
MOM: That's great.
ERNESTO: Uh, it's good to see you. Because I really wanted a chance to thank you for that. Gracias. It really meant a lot to me. Don't worry about lunch. It's on me. It's the least I can You guys should listen to her. She's a smart lady.
MOM: You guys should listen to her. She's a smart lady.
ERNESTO: You guys should listen to her. She's a smart lady.

MASON: .Isn't that kind of crazy though, that a computer knows who you are from just twenty questions off a form? I guess there are really only like eight types of people in the
MOM: Have you even talked to this guy No, but we've been trading emails. He seems pretty cool. He's studying literature, and uh, anthropology, and he's way into Bright Eyes. so that's not so bad. But anyways, he was telling me about how the system they use for assigning roommates is kind of spooky. Like, the Freshmen satisfaction rate for new roommates used to be like 60%, and now it's 100%. Just cause of the computer.

Just cause of the computer.
MOM: Well. Sounds like he'll be a good roommate, then.
MASON: Yeah. But we've pretty much decided that soon they won't even need a questionnaire. Because they'll just let the NSA scan your digital ghost, and they'll tell you who your roommate is, based on everything you've ever said, written, or clicked.
MOM: Come on, it's the first picture you ever took.
MASON: Well, I mean, all the more reason to leave it behind, right?

MOM: I knew this day was coming. I just I didn't know you were gonna be so fuckin' happy to be leaving.
MASON: I mean, it's not that I'm that happy. What do you, what do you expect?
MOM: You know what I'm realizing? My life is just gonna go, like that! This series of milestones.
