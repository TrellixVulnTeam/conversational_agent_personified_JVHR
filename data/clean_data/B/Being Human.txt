THIRD DRAFT: January, 1992
BEING HUMAN: Hector is a family man. He and his woman and two children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a hillside, a shallow cave given protection at its entrance by a covering of branches and brush. Just inside a small fire smoulders permanently, a few times a day encouraged into life for cooking or warmth. If it ever went out it would be a catastrophe, so it remains a smouldering com- fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family. Hector doesn't know that his name is Hector. It is simply a convenience to help us tell his story. The idea of individual names is an imaginative leap that has not yet been made by mankind when we first meet him. Hector is living out his life 4000 years before the birth of Christ, in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet. In his entire life Hector will traverse no more than ten square miles of it.
FIRST IMAGE: is the reflection of Hector's face in a rock pool. The image suddenly fragments. Hector is enjoying himself, deflecting his stream of pee now and then so that his image reforms itself and then is disrupted again. When he is finished, a trace of vanity makes him bend down closer to his reflection. He strokes his long hair and fingers a blemish on his cheek. Then he is aware of another presence. He sharply turns. Some way off a solitary figure stands on the rise of some rocks, not afraid to show itself. Hector calls out.
HECTOR: Go back home. leave me alone.
HECTOR: No. stay here. stay!
HECTOR: No. go back. go away.
HECTOR: Leave me alone! Stay here.
HECTOR: Up the hill!
DEIRDRE: No, down onto the other beach. The little ones can't take the hill. Neither can I.
HECTOR: Up the hill! They're down there already. I saw them!
DEIRDRE: You're wrong!
GIRL: Come back, Dada.
BOY: I'm hungry.
HECTOR: Don't move from here. I'll come for you in the morning. There's no food. Try and sleep in the branches. Don't cry. Don't make a noise.
RAIDER: It's too cold to spend all night up there. We've got a fire at the beach. Food, too. Come on! Your mother's down there. She's happy. she's warm, too. and full. she wants to see you. she sent me.
RAIDER: Come on! Your mother's down there. She's happy. she's warm, too. and full. she wants to see you. she sent me.
RAIDER: That was easy, eh? You're half asleep already, little girl. I'll carry you.
PRIEST: I told you! I knew they did it around here! Ask him.
LEADER: What do we do? Do we throw you over, is that the idea?
LEADER: He wants me to throw you over. What does it do? Does it help the sun? Should I throw you over?
PRIEST: I tell you, it's one man, one stone. It'll help the voyage.
LEADER: What's it got to do with the sun?
PRIEST: I don't know, yet.
LEADER: No. It's too much of a risk. Just add a stone to the pile. Let him go. That's the best we can do. Let's go.
PRIEST: It's meaningless, without him going over the cliff.
LEADER: Off you go. We don't want you.
LUCINNIUS: I'm going to the cool room.
MAN #1: Well washed, Lucinnius.
LUCINNIUS: Bad omens, Hector. Bad omens. Get me something to eat. Just a mouse or two.
HECTOR: Hector places the stool at Lucinnius's feet and moves off. Lucinnius sits down, still absorbed in his problems. Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius as he orders the food.
HECTOR: Two mice. and some bread.
STALLHOLDER: No mice.
HECTOR: Two chicken legs, then, cold, and the bread.
JULIAN: Of course you're free to call at my house at anytime, but I was receiving Nepos. how could I admit you?
SLAVE #1: Spoiled his day, meeting your man. he's been avoiding him all week.
SLAVE #2: His ships have gone too, we heard.
HECTOR: When did you hear?
SLAVE #2: Last night. Nepos knew. Pirates. They're sunk, he reckons. That could finish him, eh?
HECTOR: This is the worst it's been.
SLAVE #1: You'll be up for sale before you know it! He's finished. you reckon?
HECTOR: He's finished. you reckon?
SLAVE #1: Yes. at the baths. I could tell. they smelled blood.
HECTOR: Well. if he'd pulled it off he'd be in Rome by now.
SLAVE #1: And you with him.
HECTOR: And me with him. half way home.
LUCINNIUS: He's a true friend, probably the only one I have left.
HECTOR: Will he lend you the money?
LUCINNIUS: He was honest about it. He said so, plain and simple. No.
HECTOR: That's a problem.
LUCINNIUS: And the ships have gone. did I tell you that?
HECTOR: Have they?
LUCINNIUS: Cyprian knows already. He'll want his money back too.
LUCINNIUS: When we get home I want you to get some chickens. and fetch Hermas, the diviner.
HECTOR: 26 INT. HOUSE - DAY 26
LUCINNIUS: Are my ships from Sicily still
HERMAS: No, no. offer the grain first. sprinkle it on the altar.
HERMAS: . and we can't ask the Gods specific questions like that. it's a gentle, probing enquiry. general questions. but let's
HERMAS: General answer. no.
LUCINNIUS: What do you mean?
HERMAS: I mean, no. The liver says no.
LUCINNIUS: Do it again. I want you to do it again. Is it the Gods' will. that Cyprian. be well disposed towards me. in the future?
HERMAS: If you want to do it again, you need another chicken and another fifteen sesterces. and I'd like the first fifteen now please.
LUCINNIUS: Cyprian loaned me half a million to fit out these ships. I'm finished. Just when things were going well. I had plans for you too, Hector. in four or five years I was going to make you a free man. and then in ten years you'd be a citizen. you. you could've found your family. brought them here. everything.
HECTOR: It sounds good.
LUCINNIUS: It does, doesn't it!
LUCINNIUS: I shouldn't give up. I can't. I'll visit Cyprian, first thing tomorrow. before the others can get to him. he's got to see reason. I can pay him back. sometime. It's the only chance we have, Hector. Should I do it?
HECTOR: You must.
LUCINNIUS: You're right. I must.
LUCINNIUS: Thalia, I think I need one of your massages. Hector, you can finish the lamps.
LUCINNIUS: Lower, Thalia.
FIGURE: I missed you last night.
HECTOR: He kept me working until morning.
THALIA: What's happening?
HECTOR: He has no money and a lot of enemies. If he's very clever he'll survive. but the omens are bad. and he's not very clever.
THALIA: She doesn't like him.
HECTOR: Nobody does. He's unfortunate. You get people like that. Clumsy and sad.
THALIA: Why does the thunder always stay out on the ocean?
HECTOR: It's the Gods arguing. They're working out what to do with Lucinnius. he'll be lying awake down there. wondering what they're saying about him.
HECTOR: If he goes down I'll ask for my freedom. he owes it to me. he said as much. you too. we could be free.
THALIA: Then what?
HECTOR: What we talk about.
THALIA: We talk about going home. Yours is that way and mine is that way. your family is that way.
HECTOR: I just made that up. I don't know which way they are. anyway . you can't think like that. Not after so many years.
THALIA: It's what you talk about.
HECTOR: We talk about it because it can never happen. What we do is you and me.
THALIA: I don't understand. I think you'll leave. You're going to leave me Never. It's you and me now. That's all.
HECTOR: Never. It's you and me now. That's all.
THALIA: Well. We stay here. He'll survive. Then I can see you every night. I'm tired.
HECTOR: Then I can see you every night. I'm tired.
LUCINNIUS: I can't sleep. Get me a chicken. I want to make another sacrifice. We'll do it ourselves.
MAN: Can't you find a woman, Hector.
HECTOR: Sorry to trouble you. just fetching a chicken. good night . the roof's free.
HECTOR: Come on, miss, you can tell Lucinnius his future.
HECTOR: You look happier.
LUCINNIUS: Relieved anyway. relieved that it's over at last.
HECTOR: Will he help you?
LUCINNIUS: I have to kill myself by tomorrow morning. He has all my letters to Titinius, none of them got through. He says it's like treason. and he says I should want to die for owing him half a million anyway.
HECTOR: What if you don't.
LUCINNIUS: Then he will. and that wouldn't be pleasant. he would drag me to Rome. those letters.
LUCINNIUS: I'm done for, Hector. but it's strange. I feel kind of good about it. the struggle is over . we've seen it through together, eh?
HECTOR: I don't know what to say.
LUCINNIUS: Let's get home. We have a lot to
LUCINNIUS: Tonight. peace at last.
LUCINNIUS: We'll do it with a knife, Hector. When everyone has gone to bed. The two of us, to the end.
HECTOR: I don't understand. What do you want me to do. I don't think I can help you.
LUCINNIUS: We'll help each other, Hector. We must. We've been through this whole mess together. we must die I don't know what you mean. What You don't understand do you? I'm asking you to die with me. you're my closest, my dearest slave. what would they say about me if you refused to die with me? This is honor. we're choosing death. we're not going to submit to the humiliations that Cyprian can heap on us, are we?
HECTOR: I don't know what you mean. What You don't understand do you? I'm asking you to die with me. you're my closest, my dearest slave. what would they say about me if you refused to die with me? This is honor. we're choosing death. we're not going to submit to the humiliations that Cyprian can heap on us, are we?
LUCINNIUS: You don't understand do you? I'm asking you to die with me. you're my closest, my dearest slave. what would they say about me if you refused to die with me? This is honor. we're choosing death. we're not going to submit to the humiliations that Cyprian can heap on us, are we?
HECTOR: You say we. I don't know. what is we? I've done nothing. I know nothing.
LUCINNIUS: Hector. at Cyprian's this morning . I had to sign certain papers . tell a bit of a story.
HECTOR: What kind of story?
LUCINNIUS: A confession. That we were plotting against Cyprian and the provincial senate. we were short of names. most of the people I know were in the room. people I thought were my friends. so I mentioned you. I had to.
HECTOR: So I'm a conspirator?
LUCINNIUS: Yes. So you see, I don't want you to die with me just because of my honor. it's more complicated. I'm sorry, Hector. I would be honored. if you would die with me. I mean it.
HECTOR: Can I sit down?
LUCINNIUS: Of course.
HECTOR: This is the worst it's been.
HECTOR: But even if it's round you can still fall off the edge.
GALLUS: No. it's not round like that. it's round like this.
HECTOR: Do you believe everything that Greek tells you.?
GALLUS: Rome must be right in the middle. here. and we must be out here
HECTOR: So, where is my home?
GALLUS: How many months did they march you
HECTOR: Gallus walks out the distance from Rome with his fingers, as if there is serious calculation.
GALLUS: It must be about here.
GALLUS: But then you'd be upside down.
HECTOR: I wasn't upside down. and how could you see the sun round there . I saw the sun at home. every
GALLUS: I'll ask him tomorrow.
HECTOR: Yes, tell me tomorrow. I'd like to know. because my children are round there and I want to know that they're getting the sun. ask him something else, too. where are the gods if the whole thing is round?
GALLUS: I think I know that. they're out here, and all around. that's how they can look down and see
LUCINNIUS: If he eats the grain it means yes.
HECTOR: It's saying yes. there's a way.
LUCINNIUS: No, it's saying yes, we should die.
HECTOR: But you asked it if we had to die, or if there was another way. it's saying yes, there is.
LUCINNIUS: No, it's saying yes, we should die.
HECTOR: Maybe it's just hungry.
DALMIA: The kitchen slave quickly appears.
DALMIA: Solus. I'm eating chicken again. I ate chicken yesterday and the day before. will I be eating chicken again tomorrow? Why am I always eating chicken?
SOLUS: It's what we have to hand in the kitchen, ma'am. I always try to use the fresh stuff. the chickens have just been turning
SLAVE: Two men have come to see you. From Cyprian.
VISITOR: Good evening, Lucinnius. Cyprian asked us if we could be of any assistance. in the business that you have to conduct tonight. to make that business as. comfortable. as you could wish.
LUCINNIUS: Thank you, gentlemen. But I feel that I will be capable of taking care of my affairs tonight without your help. Thank Cyprian for his kind thought.
VISITOR: We're spending the night at the house of Nepos, not far from here. Don't hesitate to send your man for us. at any time. We're anxious that things should go well for you.
LUCINNIUS: Thank you. Good night.
VISITOR: We'll call in the morning at any rate. just to make sure.
LUCINNIUS: Thank you.
VISITOR: You. Come here.
VISITOR: He looks like the kind that'll want some help. Have you ever killed before?
HECTOR: Only chickens.
VISITOR: He's not much different. Use a thin blade, but long. Get it in deep. the heart. feel for a space between the ribs.
VISITOR: . or go in from the back. any place he'll let you.
VISITOR: Getting it out's not as easy as you might think. you have to twist a bit. to get over the
LUCINNIUS: Eight hundred sesterces. cash . that's all that's left. what a failure. my father left me three farms and forty thousand.
LUCINNIUS: Nothing else to be done. Don't you want some wine?
HECTOR: No. but I want something.
LUCINNIUS: What is it?
HECTOR: I want to die a free man. I don't want to die a slave.
LUCINNIUS: Hector, by this proclamation, I make you a freed man. I don't know the exact words. I've never done it before. But you're free, In writing. so that when they find me. they know I died a free man. please.
HECTOR: In writing. so that when they find me. they know I died a free man. please.
LUCINNIUS: Very well.
LUCINNIUS: They'll find it in the morning. It's a nice thought, Hector. you were right to ask.
HECTOR: Thank you.
LUCINNIUS: Well. freed man, let's do it.
HECTOR: What do you want me to do?
LUCINNIUS: Nothing. I mean, not to me. I have to do it first. you understand that. and then you. if I don't succeed. then you must help me.
HECTOR: I understand.
LUCINNIUS: No point in messing up the room. Let's go downstairs.
LUCINNIUS: Oh, that hurts, that stings!
LUCINNIUS: This is hopeless.
LUCINNIUS: Help me, Hector.
HECTOR: You've done it. you've done it . lie down.
HECTOR: Close your eyes. you did it.
LUCINNIUS: Thank you, thank you.
LUCINNIUS: You do it now, Hector. hurry.
HECTOR: Lie still. lie still.
LUCINNIUS: Do it Hector. do it. you
HECTOR: Shush. I'll need the knife.
LUCINNIUS: Take it. do it.
LUCINNIUS: Do it, Hector. do it. do it. Do it. do it. do it.
LUCINNIUS: Do it. do it. do it.
HECTOR: I'm leaving. come now if you want to. but we must hurry. I'm a free man. I'm free. Will you come?
HECTOR: I have some mail for Tyre. where are the east-bound ships?
WATCHMAN: Ask at the harbor.
HECTOR: We want a timber ship. they go west. straight to Rome.
THALIA: And then? Then you go home?
HECTOR: You can go to anywhere from Rome.
HECTOR: Where is the Captain?
CREWMAN: He's on the ship.
HECTOR: Good morning, Captain. I'm looking for passage to Rome, for both of us.
CAPTAIN: And who might you be?
HECTOR: I'm the steward of Lucinnius the merchant. we have business in Rome. I need an immediate It's five or six days. to Brundisium. you can walk or ride from there. you have money?

HECTOR: Keen to start, yes.
CREWMAN: Captain says to come on deck.
THALIA: Where's the land gone?
THALIA: Have you been on a ship before?
HECTOR: Yes, of course.
THALIA: Me, too, but they kept us down
THALIA: Tonight. we'll be where the thunder is!
CAPTAIN: Thought you would like to see
CAPTAIN: Your master's ships. going
HECTOR: No. they can't be. they're No they're not. I know these ships. my brother-in-law's the master of the big one with the brown sail.
CAPTAIN: No they're not. I know these ships. my brother-in-law's the master of the big one with the brown sail.
CAPTAIN: Somebody been putting the wind up Lucinnius? That's an old one. didn't think anybody'd fall for
PRIEST: We want to praise God because we live in this ultimate age, when all things are done, all is known, all the wonders of his creation revealed to us. nothing more for man to see or do. all that is left is the hope of salvation. even for our humbler sisters.
PRIEST: Yes weep, child, weep for joy. you are a glorious example to us all. already a child of God's. blessed to spend your earthly days within his church as Christ's servant. what generous parents you have. giving you to the sisters. What a sacrifice.
NUN: She's already received the last rites, before she left her family. She belongs to God now. Don't you?
PRIEST: Fortunate child, destined for paradise. Untouched by the abiding curse of carnal lust. I struggle against it.
PRIEST: . I will carry my unspilt seed from this world to the next. as should every man.
PRIEST: . If all men forsook forever the fleshy temptations. and held womankind to barrenness. think how much the sooner would come the day of judgement. all God's chosen gathered in paradise. I've written a small treatise in favor of virginity, sister. We could discuss it later if you like. What are you talking about?
DRIVER: What are you talking about?
PRIEST: It's simple, brother. if we cease carnal union entirely then in fifty or so years we'll all be rid of our earthly lives and God can proceed with His reign over His heavenly kingdom. that same paradise that God gave to man before, but which man was so unfit to inhabit that within seven hours Eve was already tempting her master and mate, and within nine hours the Lord had to expel the both of them! Just think, they messed it up in nine hours!
HECTOR: A bit cold. walking.
HECTOR: How long to get there?
DRIVER: When it gets dark, we'll be there.
HECTOR: I thought I heard fighting. back I don't know what you're saying. I haven't understood anything you've said all day.
BEATRICE: I don't know what you're saying. I haven't understood anything you've said all day.
HECTOR: I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you're saying.
BEATRICE: I don't know what you're saying.
HECTOR: I don't understand.
GIRL: I want to go home to my mother.
PRIEST: Just bread and water for me, Mistress. I have no need of wine or meat.
PRIEST: God, I'm starving. Do you think I dare heat that up on the fire? No. I'll eat it cold. I deserve to suffer.
PRIEST: No. I'll eat it cold. I deserve to suffer.
PRIEST: Have some wine.
HECTOR: I saw some fighting today. back up the road.
PRIEST: So, the mad knights are at it again. what were they, Swiss or English?
HECTOR: I don't know. They all look the same to me.
PRIEST: It might help us get through. if there's a bit of confusion. we'll still travel separately though, for now.
PRIEST: But, Hector, you must keep out of the way of temptation. I saw the way you were eyeing up that widow. now stay away from that. although she is beautiful, is she not. but we're going home, remember.
HECTOR: How do you know she's a widow?
PRIEST: Look at her eyes. hungry eyes. she could lead you into trouble. she smells like paradise, though.
PRIEST: Listen, Hector, let's get this clear. if anyone's going to dally with that widow it'll be me. you couldn't handle her. she'd bewitch you. at any rate, you're not a sinning kind of fellow, are you. why don't you get off up the road tomorrow, and I'll catch you up, in five or so days.
PRIEST: You're not a sinning fellow, remember. another month and we'll be at the channel, then home. the little ones you only talk about when you're drunk. don't forget them.
PRIEST: Why do I always talk so much. you weren't even thinking of her 'til I opened my mouth. but I trust you. don't worry. I know you wouldn't do anything to anger your God, or me. Get me some
PRIEST: Who saved your neck in Venice?
HECTOR: You did, Ronald.
PRIEST: And don't you forget it.
PRIEST: May the Lord forgive us our sins, those we have committed and those we as yet only dream of. She's a glory of a woman.
PEDLAR: Hostages, too, they've got. they only take the rich ones.
PEDLAR: Have you ever seen so many fine, rich men, my girl? I won't be travelling today.
HECTOR: I won't be travelling today.
PRIEST: The fighting's behind us, brother . you'll be safe enough.
HECTOR: I'll stay.
PRIEST: You should go.
NUN: We're going. God will protect his ewe lambs.
SOLDIER: Must be sore in there. Is it your
SOLDIER #2: If he's got a little head it might be alright. Has your dada got a big head?
OFFICER: Is there a blacksmith here? Where's the smith?
FARM WOMAN: In the village, sir, half a day You, Priest, come here. get to work on him. he's not ready for heaven yet. there's a hundred thousand livres on his head if I get him to Paris alive. Start praying. there's fifteen livres in it for you if he lives.
OFFICER: You, Priest, come here. get to work on him. he's not ready for heaven yet. there's a hundred thousand livres on his head if I get him to Paris alive. Start praying. there's fifteen livres in it for you if he lives.
OFFICER: Get that helmet off. get hammers, anything you can find. and one of you get back down into the valley and fetch an armorer.
HECTOR: I think you know what I'm saying . a little.
BEATRICE: No, I don't, I don't understand a word.
HECTOR: How come you don't speak like anyone else? Are you far from home? Home? Where you sleep and live?
BEATRICE: I think I know what you mean. I'm far from home, too. way, way over there. then across the sea.
HECTOR: I'm far from home, too. way, way over there. then across the sea.
BEATRICE: You're losing me again.
HECTOR: Have you ever seen the sea? Water everywhere. right to the end of the world. I come from the other side of the little water, then there's the big, big water. I had a friend who sailed on that. went too far. fell right over the edge. into nothing. They never came back. they fell off the world.
HECTOR: You think that's funny? It's true. it's a sad story. you shouldn't laugh.
BEATRICE: Talk about home again. remember you said home?
HECTOR: I'm not making sense, am I? Well, let's go back to homes. That's where I'm going. I've been away for too long. Some people locked me up. I had to run away.
BEATRICE: Tell me something else.
HECTOR: We have to learn to talk the same. try it like me, say it. I know what you're saying. you're saying home. say something else.
BEATRICE: I know what you're saying. you're saying home. say something else.
HECTOR: Home. home. try it. home.
BEATRICE: You want the word for home? It's home. say it. home. home.
HECTOR: I don't want your word for home, I want you to say mine. home. Come on, you can do it. home.
BEATRICE: Come on, you can do it. home.
HECTOR: Home. home.
BEATRICE: That's it. clever boy!
BEATRICE: Tick. it's a tick.
HECTOR: Flea. a flea. thanks.
BEATRICE: Bet there's more in there. You need a good going over. nobody's been looking after you.
HECTOR: Why don't we go somewhere and have a good session. I could do you. I'd like to give you a good grooming.
OFFICER: How is he?
PRIEST: Sleeping now. at peace, for the Leave him for a while. There are a few souls out here you can help on their way to heaven. Ten sous a soul to you. come on.
OFFICER: Leave him for a while. There are a few souls out here you can help on their way to heaven. Ten sous a soul to you. come on.
RONALD: Twenty sous is normal. How many are there?
BEATRICE: That's four.
HECTOR: Yes, it does feel good.
BEATRICE: You can do me now.
HECTOR: Got one. a tiny little one. yours are so small. and fair.
HECTOR: I don't know your name. I'm Hector. who are you? I'm
BEATRICE: Hector. yes. I'm Beatrice.
HECTOR: Yes. Hector. I think you'll have to do under my arms. I'm a little itchy there.
BEATRICE: Yes. Hector. I think you'll have to do under my arms. I'm a little itchy there.
HECTOR: Yes, I think Beatrice is a good
BEATRICE: Maybe we should find the river, and have a proper wash.
BEATRICE: I'm still itchy lots of places,
PRIEST: Goodbye, little girl. the Lord will bless you, I know, in his
PRIEST: How long for you on the road?
NUN: Three or four days.
PRIEST: Good luck to you.
NUN: They're not killing nuns, yet.
PRIEST: The Saxon, won't he go with you?
NUN: He's nowhere to be seen.
SOLDIER: My name is Peter. don't forget . tell everybody that was my name. Peter.
PRIEST: Lie still, Peter.
SOLDIER: That's it, Peter. tell everybody . write it. don't forget it. Peter. tell them Peter died here . my name is Peter. Peter. say it again.
PRIEST: Ronald behaves well with the dying boy.
HECTOR: Good morning. You're a busy man, what with all these souls departing.
HECTOR: You're a busy man, what with all these souls departing.
PRIEST: There's nothing wrong with helping someone to die in peace. They want me to go with them.
HECTOR: Nothing at all.
PRIEST: Are you staying here?
HECTOR: Moving on, as you told me to. we'll meet up, like you said. I'll wait for you at the channel.
PRIEST: She'll do you harm. I told you. She might be a witch. Wait for me. I still have the money from Venice. We can be home in a Witch my arse. Stop giving me
HECTOR: Witch my arse. Stop giving me
HECTOR: You're a strange fellow. Are you a priest? Are you jealous?
SOLDIER: We're moving soon, Father.
PRIEST: So, you're leaving?
HECTOR: You have work to do here. I don't understand you.
HECTOR: I don't understand you.
HECTOR: I'm glad we're going the same way.
BEATRICE: We'll have to sleep in the hills tonight. Will you keep me warm?
BEATRICE: Hurry up and finish your wine and then we can make love.
HECTOR: Why do you smell so wonderful?
BEATRICE: Oh, you like my smell, do you? I make it from the flowers. I put it here, and there, and there.
BEATRICE: I don't believe it. someone's watching us, the dirty devil. don't look. he's down by the water, by the rocks.
BEATRICE: Cheeky devil.
HECTOR: He's not moving. He must've seen us, though.
BEATRICE: Don't look at him anymore. Let's go. down the other side of the
HECTOR: It's a dead man.
HECTOR: Come on, we're going that way at any rate.
HECTOR: No sign of a battle. only a few horses. or just one. He wasn't killed in a fight.
BEATRICE: Poor boy. Isn't he fine-looking. Look at his shoes.
BEATRICE: We'll cover his eyes at least. so the crows don't get him. Look at these shoes, though.
HECTOR: That's good of you.
HECTOR: It's all we can do. It won't keep the wolves away though.
BEATRICE: His feet are like mine, you know. I'll give you mine, poor boy, and I'll have yours. I have more walking to do.
BEATRICE: It's not stealing if I give him mine, is it?
HECTOR: You've put magic in this stuff, haven't you, you're bewitching
BEATRICE: You're eager today, Hector, aren't you? Is it all this death?
HECTOR: I don't know what you're saying but I like you when you talk.
BEATRICE: That should help him a little.
HECTOR: We should go now. We've been here too long.
BEATRICE: I wonder if his mama will ever know what happened.
HECTOR: You said mama. I know what that is. mama. We can talk the Mama. that's right. mama.
BEATRICE: Mama. that's right. mama.
HECTOR: I have to keep the sun on my back, that's what Ronald said. the sun on my back all the way home. I'll stay on this side of the Yes, of course. we stay on this side of the river, all the way down. until tomorrow.
BEATRICE: Yes, of course. we stay on this side of the river, all the way down. until tomorrow.
HECTOR: I stay on this side.
BEATRICE: Yes. On this side. Then the
HECTOR: Oh yes. oh yes.
HECTOR: I think we're going the wrong way. I want the sun on my back. We should have stayed on the other
BEATRICE: Don't worry. we're nearly there. I'll fix your back for you. give you a good rub.
BEATRICE: Here we are. home. you want some food. and then I'll show you everything. We have a spring . you can wash.
BEATRICE: This is when I wish you could understand me. You'll have to learn, you know. I want you to stay here. You want to, don't
BEATRICE: I look after the hens, and I make dyes from the plants, and perfumes too. I'm good at that. But I'm no good with the sheep and the goats. I wish you could understand. Arnaud's been dead two years.
BEATRICE: I still have his clothes. I'll make them fit you. What did he die of?
HECTOR: What did he die of?
BEATRICE: I'm getting shy. Imagine me being shy with you. I made this for him. tonight we'll try them on. You're the same height as Arnaud, but a little thinner. I'll make them fit. I'm a good sewer. And we have a big bed upstairs for you and me, in the rafters. You and me. sleep.
BEATRICE: I like you. You like me too, don't you? We were lucky to meet the way we did. All the men around here are old.
BEATRICE: Come up and I'll show you the bed.
BEATRICE: A good bed, eh? For you and me. We can have fun up here. better than a ditch. Mama, are you home?
GIRL: You were gone a long time. Who's
BEATRICE: This is Hector.
BEATRICE: These are my children.
BEATRICE: . and this is my mother..
HECTOR: Is there water. to drink. to
BEATRICE: Take Hector to the well. but come here first.
HECTOR: No, no. sit down. I just came to watch. please. sit.
MOTHER: We can't have this. this was Arnaud's seat. it's yours now. I can sit on the box.
HECTOR: You must sit there. look. you need the light from the window. it's your seat. I don't want it. it's yours. I can sit on the box.
HECTOR: The Boy says something and points towards his sister. She stands by her cauldron, stirring the bubbling liquid. Hector goes to watch her work. He looks in the cauldron.
HECTOR: Good color. for cloth?
HECTOR: The Girl says something to him, and points to a bucket of liquid at her feet. Hector makes out something like the word "peepee."
HECTOR: The Girl nods enthusiastically. The Boy is sniggering.
HECTOR: Mmmm. good food..
BEATRICE: Take a walk to the village if you want. you look as if you need a walk.
HECTOR: I have to leave soon. I can't stay. it would be wrong to stay for just a while.
HECTOR: I have to go. have to keep the sun on my back. I have to get home. I have a family, just like you. I like you. you smell good. wonderful.
HECTOR: I had a wonderful dream. I was lying under a tree, beside a river. I was dozing. I heard the water. beautiful clear water. I got up and drank some. I think I ate some raspberries too.
ANDRE: I would like some water. God, this is the worst, the worst.
HECTOR: God, this is the worst, the worst.
WOMAN: Let me keep him. they said we'll find land in a day or so. you're When they're dead they go over the side. The place stinks enough as it is.
MAN: When they're dead they go over the side. The place stinks enough as it is.
ANDRE: Do you think I'll still see I think there's more chance of me eating you, Andre.
HECTOR: I think there's more chance of me eating you, Andre.
DOM PAULO: I think today will be the day, my friends. We've been in the inshore currents since yesterday. Three crowns to the first one to sight the coast. God preserve us
SAILOR: Never mind the three crowns. a side of beef would do. or a drink of clean water. Don't worry, there'll be food for all ashore. Africa's full of meat and drink.
DOM PAULO: Don't worry, there'll be food for all ashore. Africa's full of meat and drink.
SAILOR: It's full of Africans too.
DOM PAULO: How many made it?
OFFICER: Eighty men. Ten women. Eighteen children and forty-five slaves.
DOM PAULO: Two parties of ten men each. one to the north and one to the south. bring back what you can. game, fruit, anything. and send someone back as soon as you find fresh water. Any trouble, discharge three shots.
DOM PAULO: Have the carpenter start immediately on a cross, a big one. Father Diogo wants a place of worship by this time tomorrow. We'll look for a spot later. We've all got a lot of praying to do. And where's Dias. tell him I want to see
HECTOR: I have a carpet and some cloth. I thought if we worked together we could make a better shelter.
FRANCISCO: If it's a joke it's a poor one.
HECTOR: At least ask Dona Ursula.
FRANCISCO: I don't have to ask her. I know she would agree with me. leave us
HECTOR: Well. would you take my cloth, at least?
FRANCISCO: Keep it and build your own hovel somewhere else. leave us
SAILOR: They ran off with the dry bread. about eight of them, sir.
DOM PAULO: You men are deserters. You will die tomorrow.
DOM PAULO: Chain them on the raft for tonight, and watch them.
FRANCISCO: I must object. these sentences can't be lawful.
DOM PAULO: Do you think so?
FRANCISCO: Of course. we can't allow ourselves to fall into terror and violence.
DOM PAULO: You're right. but then how can we punish them? We can't lock them
SALGADO: You were right the first time, sir. they must hang. they were stealing the bread from our
YOUNG DESERTER: I didn't steal any bread. Gomes had the bread. he's off, in the Oh dear.
DOM PAULO: Oh dear.
DOM PAULO: What do you think, Father?
PRIEST: I'll comfort them whether they live or die, now or later, any of you, all of you. I'll comfort you all.
SALGADO: Hang them. you have to set an
DOM PAULO: So I was right the first time?
FRANCISCO: No, sir. there must be proper What's proper justice?
DOM PAULO: What's proper justice?
DESERTER: I didn't steal any bread.
SALGADO: You have to make a decision, sir.
DESERTER: It was Gomes. he told us to run.
DOM PAULO: I'll decide. no I won't. we'll all decide. most of the people that matter are here. we'll have a vote. who agrees with Salgado. and me. that they should die?
DOM PAULO: . and those against death.
DOM PAULO: You can't vote.
DOM PAULO: Can he?
SALGADO: It doesn't matter.
SALGADO: I don't think this is working, Dom Paulo. we need authority. you must decide.
DOM PAULO: Very well. Da Cunha?
DOM PAULO: The cross the carpenter is working on. tell him to turn it into a scaffold. have it erected along the beach, away from the women. the executions will be at sunrise tomorrow. Tell Father Diogo.
DOM PAULO: Take them to the raft.
DOM PAULO: Everyone in agreement with hanging? Or should we shoot them. or what?
DA CUNHA: Hanging is fine, sir.
DOM PAULO: Very well. now. who's going to conduct the executions. should we pick someone, or have a
DOM PAULO: Hector doesn't have the will to accept or the courage to refuse. He is saved by another young man, ALVAREZ, eager to prove himself.
ALVAREZ: I'll do it, Dom Paulo.
DOM PAULO: Thank you, Alvarez. Sunrise tomorrow. Send the Priest to them tonight.
HECTOR: Good work, Andre.
HECTOR: You go and sleep by the big fire, Andre. Keep warm.
NUNO: Senor Hector?
NUNO: This was all they found in the forest. Four for each of us. They taste kind of milky, but Thank you, Nuno.
HECTOR: Thank you, Nuno.
NUNO: My mother ate three and she was sick. So try two. but she's sick anyway. maybe you can try
HECTOR: I'll start with two.
NUNO: Hector, will you help me?
NUNO: Lopo. the boy they're going to hang tomorrow. he was cook's cabin boy. I was going to take him something to eat. I thought, perhaps, one of yours and one of
NUNO: You said you might just eat two.
HECTOR: But there's tomorrow, Nuno. we must eat tomorrow too.
HECTOR: Dom Paulo would call it a waste. You must keep yourself strong, Nuno, that's what he'd say. so that you can help the others. God knows what we have ahead of us. we'll need strong people like you.
HECTOR: Try not to think about Lopo any more. The guards wouldn't let you near him anyway.
HECTOR: 100 INT. CAMP - NIGHT 100
DA CUNHA: Some gunpowder would scatter them, No, they might want to be friendly. they'll have food too. get one of our African slaves. we must try and talk to them. If they think we're timid we're dead.
DOM PAULO: No, they might want to be friendly. they'll have food too. get one of our African slaves. we must try and talk to them. If they think we're timid we're dead.
HECTOR: I hate it when people have to die.
FRANCISCO: It's foolishness. Killing our own men when we have the whole of Africa to face.
HECTOR: It's foolish squabbling at all. We should be friends.
FRANCISCO: What's this?
HECTOR: Some bread and raisins.
FRANCISCO: I thought everything was shared out on the raft.
HECTOR: Well this wasn't. It's for her. and you.
HECTOR: I must speak to her!
SLAVE: They want to make a visit here. with their King. he will bring gifts, and will receive gifts. They said not to sacrifice anymore men for them. they don't like
OFFICER: Turtles' eggs, sir. Doctor Correa was shipping them to the Royal Zoo. I think they hoped some of them would hatch.
DOM PAULO: Well. it's eggs for supper tonight. for everyone.
HECTOR: How are they?
ANDRE: Hector cracks one of his eggs into a copper pan. Inside is a brown smudge of dried yoke and some dust. Hector grunts in annoyance and cracks another egg. The yoke is discolored and the smell is rank. Hector looks at Andre, rapidly finishing his omelette before Hector can demand
HECTOR: Yours were fine?
ANDRE: Hector picks up a third egg and shakes itclose to his ear. It seems as empty as the other two. He picks up a fourth egg and cracks it open. A small dried-up, half- formed baby turtle RATTLES into the pan. Andre is quietly enjoying Hector's frustration. He stands up to
ANDRE: Good night.
HECTOR: Have you any eggs left?
ANDRE: The slaves only got three. I want to ask you something.
HECTOR: You were lucky. What?
ANDRE: I want my real name back.
HECTOR: You don't like Andre anymore?
ANDRE: I think of my home all the time. I want to hear the name they call me. We should die with our real We're not going to die, Andre.
HECTOR: We're not going to die, Andre.
HECTOR: I've forgotten your name.
ANDRE: Ketabomago Pululo.
HECTOR: Now I remember why we called you
HECTOR: I will, Andre. I promise. I'll call you that. when I remember.
HECTOR: Good night. Keta.
ANDRE: Ketabomago Pululo.
HECTOR: Yes. good night.
HECTOR: Hey! Stop that, will you? Think of the older people, and the sick. I'll give you an egg if you stop. here.
DOM PAULO: How many are sick?
DA CUNHA: About fifty, sir, some of them very sick indeed. It's the eggs. A couple of the crates were full of rotten ones, but eaten just the same. Others just ate too many. It would have been better to ration them, I suppose.
DOM PAULO: How wise of you to think of that now. Any deaths?
DA CUNHA: DOM PAULO
DOM PAULO: How many eggs did you have?
DA CUNHA: Three. I had them boiled.
DOM PAULO: I had four. I don't feel well Four's all right. the really ill ones had eaten eight, ten.
DA CUNHA: Four's all right. the really ill ones had eaten eight, ten.
DOM PAULO: Let's not think about it. what have you got?
SALGADO: It worked well. they'll go for this. and nails. Luis cleaned up a sackful from the crates. Organize some men to gather all the nails they can find. We have to keep control of that particular
DOM PAULO: Organize some men to gather all the nails they can find. We have to keep control of that particular
HECTOR: Stop that. leave her alone. get back to the camp. or I'll tell your mother. how can you play like this when there are people needing your help back there.?
HECTOR: Come back. I didn't mean it. it was a joke. you come back. she's still here. I won't say
HECTOR: I'm sorry.
SLAVE: He was excited when he heard you had come, but he wants to know if you are real people. he didn't think you would be such a strange color. so he wants to see your.
SLAVE: . so that he will know that you were born like real people.
DOM PAULO: Right. you four as well.
SLAVE: He wants to see you breathe.
DOM PAULO: Tell him that we want to trade with him, to buy food. and we want him to guide us out of here. we have a long way to travel. to where the white men have their big ships.
SLAVE: He has heard of white men very, very far away. this way. but you have to cross many rivers. twenty big rivers.
DOM PAULO: Tell him I want to give him these.
DOM PAULO: . and tell him that I want to make him a very special gift as one King to another.
DOM PAULO: Of these precious things, which my fathers and forefathers have worn for many long years before.
DOM PAULO: I shouldn't do this, but it is such a special occasion, and he is such a great and worthy King.
SLAVE: He says he could not accept such a treasured gift, something of such value to your family. instead he would be happy to take one or two of the old rings you have on your fingers. but please do not insist that he take your
SLAVE: He will give you guides to help you across the first of the big rivers. it is ten days from Thank you, thank you.
DOM PAULO: Thank you, thank you.
SLAVE: . and he asks you to be ready to leave the beach in two days time. he cannot permit you to stay longer.
SLAVE: Because with the new moon the turtles will arrive and lay their eggs. you may frighten them. you must be gone.
NUNO: ( CONTINUED )
HECTOR: Suck out the marrow. it's the best bit.
HECTOR: I'm sorry about today.
NUNO: It doesn't matter.
HECTOR: But it does. it was mean of me. I was upset at something. I wasn't really angry at you.
NUNO: I know.
HECTOR: You don't think too badly of me?
NUNO: You still like me?
HECTOR: You still like me?
HECTOR: You do?
NUNO: Hector is satisfied now.
HECTOR: Well, that makes me feel better. we all have to like each other. and respect each other. that's important too.
HECTOR: If you don't respect me, just say so.
HECTOR: I have a boy like you. maybe you could meet him when we get
HECTOR: You can take her back there tomorrow, eh?
NUNO: No. she's sick now.
DOM PAULO: Can't you be more accurate? How can I be accurate without instruments? As it is I'm sighting the sun with two pieces of wood. Call it five hundred and be done with it. he said twenty rivers.
DIAS: How can I be accurate without instruments? As it is I'm sighting the sun with two pieces of wood. Call it five hundred and be done with it. he said twenty rivers.
DOM PAULO: We just want you to be as accurate as we know you can be, Dias. After all, the ship did manage to find that rock with admirable precision.
DIAS: Confound you, Dom Paulo, that's an insult. she hit that rock because she was taking water and unsteerable. She was overloaded before she left India and you know
DIAS: I've told you. we vote for a leader or you can walk into the jungle on your own. it should have been done days ago.
DA CUNHA: Calm down, Dias. you can't stay here forever, living on turtles'
DA CUNHA: What about the sick and the injured, Dom Paulo.?
DOM PAULO: I've discussed it with Father Diogo. I don't see how a hundred of us can carry seventy sick.
FATHER DIOGO: I'm going to search the scriptures tonight. I'm sure that God has an answer to it.
DIAS: An excuse, you mean. we'll be leaving them here to die.
SALGADO: Oh, so you're coming with us now,
DIAS: After the vote.
FATHER DIOGO: It might be the best we can offer them now. the chance to die a good Christian death here, and set an example to the heathens.
HECTOR: I'll be glad when we're on the move. the sound of the sea is driving me mad.
FRANCISCO: Good night, Hector.
HECTOR: Where is Ursula? Sleeping?
FRANCISCO: Sick. She hasn't been able to rise since yesterday.
HECTOR: Will you share a bottle of wine with me? I've had it since we left the ship. I want to drink it tonight, with you.
FRANCISCO: You have a bottle of wine?
HECTOR: Well, fetch it.
FRANCISCO: Well, fetch it.
FRANCISCO: You should hang for this. Some people on the raft might have lived with a glass of this in their stomach. I know. I feel very guilty. I brought this too.
HECTOR: I know. I feel very guilty. I brought this too.
HECTOR: Honeyed fruit. The last I have.
FRANCISCO: You rogue. give it here.
HECTOR: I brought it for Ursula.
FRANCISCO: Much too rich for her. do you want to kill her?
HECTOR: Surely. some fruit couldn't.
FRANCISCO: Don't argue with me, old friend. you're the guilty one around here, and don't you forget it.
HECTOR: Why is it always me? Why am I always guilty, always sorry. am I so bad?
FRANCISCO: With Ursula you weren't bad, you were stupid. you did the one thing you can't do to a strong woman. you took away her pride. what else can she do but hate you?
FRANCISCO: And then you get on the same ship. what a fool.
HECTOR: I had to get home. just like you.
FRANCISCO: And when the ship went down. why did you have to get on the same raft. it was as if you were trying to torment her.
HECTOR: But. the other raft was sinking.
FRANCISCO: Francisco. please.
HECTOR: Francisco. please.
SLAVE: Yes. they will look after the sick. but the King would like one thing. the machine that makes music.
DOM PAULO: We need food as well. ten cows. to take with us. then the King can have the music.
HECTOR: You must come with us.
NUNO: ( CONTINUED )
ANDRE: Your mother might not get well. do you understand that?
NUNO: That's why I have to stay.
HECTOR: And afterwards. what will you do then?
NUNO: Follow you and the others.
HECTOR: Nuno remains silent.
ANDRE: Let him be.
FATHER DIOGO: I'll comfort them as best as I You're staying with them?
DOM PAULO: You're staying with them?
FATHER DIOGO: No, no, I'll comfort them before we leave. I think my place is with you.
HECTOR: Francisco. I have to see her before we leave.
FRANCISCO: I'll ask her.
FRANCISCO: In you go.
HECTOR: Ursula. it's Hector.
HECTOR: We're leaving soon. I've come to say goodbye.
URSULA: I won't forget you. I won't forget India. I can't forget how I hurt you.
HECTOR: I won't forget you. I won't forget India. I can't forget how I hurt you.
HECTOR: We should have talked. I could have explained. many things.
URSULA: Yes. I'll pray for you in Lisbon. at the Cathedral.
HECTOR: Yes. I'll pray for you in Lisbon. at the Cathedral.
HECTOR: I'm sorry I hurt your pride.
URSULA: What? What did you say? What are you talking about?
HECTOR: Nothing, nothing.
URSULA: She lies still. Hector leans over her to make sure she is still breathing. He whispers nervously.
HECTOR: 126 EXT. HUT - DAY 126
DOM PAULO: We won't forget you, or what you are doing for these poor people.
FRANCISCO: I'm not staying here with the intention of dying, Dom Paulo. we'll be following you. when we are fit and well.
DOM PAULO: Yes, of course.
FRANCISCO: . and good luck to you.
DOM PAULO: God protect you. it breaks my heart to leave you all here, but I don't know what else I can do.
DOM PAULO: We're leaving the cross with Oh, thank you.
FRANCISCO: Oh, thank you.
HECTOR: Francisco, I must talk to you
FRANCISCO: You've made your peace with her?
HECTOR: Yes. I think so.
FRANCISCO: Thank, God. Well, goodbye.
HECTOR: Is there anything that I can do for you? A letter. a message?
FRANCISCO: No. if you were carrying something for me I would have to worry about you. if you go empty-handed I can put you out of my mind!
HECTOR: I want to ask you something. There's no easy way to do it.
FRANCISCO: Go on, Hector.
HECTOR: Your boots.
FRANCISCO: What about them?
HECTOR: Can I have them? You can have mine. they'll be fine for here. but I have to walk six hundred miles. Yes, you're right. I daresay my boots would take you six hundred miles. I look after them.
FRANCISCO: Yes, you're right. I daresay my boots would take you six hundred miles. I look after them.
HECTOR: I'll walk all the way home, Francisco. I'll pray for your soul in the Cathedral in Lisbon.
FRANCISCO: . In my boots.
HECTOR: Francisco starts to laugh out loud.
FRANCISCO: Hector, you have surpassed yourself. sit down and take my
HECTOR: They were made by Da Fosca, weren't they?
FRANCISCO: The best bootmaker in Goa. pray for my soul in Lisbon, Hector. and pray for your own.
BOBBY: They've gone. long gone!
HECTOR: How long?
BOBBY: They've been gone a week, at Damn them.
HECTOR: Damn them.
BOBBY: We're ten days late.
BOBBY: Cheer up. Have a look around. I'll start on a fire.
HECTOR: It's Sandy's. whiskey.
BOBBY: Well done, my lad!
BOBBY: Even if we lose their track, we'll still hit the river. we can't miss that.
HECTOR: It's too high for Indians?
BOBBY: Much too high. You won't find an Indian up here. We just have to keep our heads. no panic.
HECTOR: If you did find an Indian, what would he be?
BOBBY: You wouldn't. but he might be a Delaware if you did.
HECTOR: We keep working?
BOBBY: Why not. We can log the peaks on the far side, just a couple of sightings a day. keep us busy.
HECTOR: You think we'll get out?
BOBBY: If we keep our heads. I wish I had some tobacco.
BOBBY: Barometer. twenty-eight and three-eighths. temperature. low. thirty-four. high. forty-two and a half. time.
BOBBY: It's getting worse. you're nearly five minutes fast now.
HECTOR: I'm not fast. you're slowing
HECTOR: What's the point of having two chronometers when you don't take the average?
BOBBY: Exactly. you should throw yours You're unscientific, Bobby. at
HECTOR: You're unscientific, Bobby. at
HECTOR: Seven twenty-five.
BOBBY: I see her in the dewy flowers I see her sweet and fair.
BOBBY: There's not a bonny bird that sings But minds me o' my Jean.
HECTOR: Sure this is a good idea.
BOBBY: Let's get out of here.
HECTOR: Hi! Hello!
HECTOR: Hey, come back. we're just moving through. don't apologize. we all got a fright.
BOBBY: That was stupid.
HECTOR: Did you see him?
BOBBY: Sure I saw him.
HECTOR: Was he a Delaware?
BOBBY: How the fuck should I know? He was an Indian. and Indians don't come in ones.
HECTOR: Yeah. I think he was an Indian too. What about the horse?
BOBBY: I'm not going back down there.
HECTOR: Don't panic, Bobby.
BOBBY: Why not? Come on!
BOBBY: Come on!
HECTOR: What did you see?
BOBBY: Same as you.
HECTOR: An Indian. with long hair.
BOBBY: That's it. kind of short.
HECTOR: Yeah. he was't tall.
BOBBY: That's the one.
HECTOR: Let's get a bit further up.
BOBBY: What've you got in there?
HECTOR: Some food, the logbooks, my letters, a candle.
BOBBY: A gun?
HECTOR: 139 EXT. CAMP - DAY 139
BOBBY: We won't have a fire tonight. We should make a shelter though, in case it snows.
HECTOR: What about bears, without a fire?
BOBBY: Don't even think about bears, Hector.
BOBBY: Maybe he's lost too. on his own. must be Delaware. they were chased up here years ago. everybody thought they'd cleared off west. the other side of Ohio. they were an angry lot. no wonder. they used to farm on the coast.
BOBBY: Go on, read it out.
HECTOR: What? No. not tonight.
BOBBY: I've had to listen to it every night since April. why not now?
HECTOR: Dear, Father, I miss you. Three frogs are dead. Everybody misses you. Bring me a bear's head and claws and a gun. School is good. Miss White has married a fireman. Come back soon. Do not worry about the frogs, they did not have names. Nathaniel.
HECTOR: It's not so funny now as it was.
BOBBY: It wasn't funny then.
HECTOR: If you knew him. if you could picture him saying it. it would be funnier.
BOBBY: I had a father like you. nine months on a whaler and then three weeks at home telling us all how much he missed us.
HECTOR: I'm going home, for the winter.
BOBBY: Smell it?
HECTOR: Goddam it. smell it?
BOBBY: Goddam it. smell it?
HECTOR: They whisper.
BOBBY: Where the hell is it coming
BOBBY: I can't tell. a night like this it could carry for miles.
BOBBY: I wish I had a smoke.
HECTOR: I was saving it. you have it.
BOBBY: What do you mean, you were saving it? You know the rules. no hoarding, tobacco or food. you've listened to me for a month, day and night. wanting a smoke.
HECTOR: Well have it now. I don't smoke. take it.
BOBBY: You've kept it from me, and you don't even use it.
HECTOR: I was saving it for my birthday. I was going to give it to you then.
BOBBY: I have to wait until your birthday for a smoke? Who are you. the fucking king?
HECTOR: Go on, smoke it. have it now.
BOBBY: I bloody won't. I'm not smoking on your command. I bloody won't.
BOBBY: God, your poor children. what do they have to do for a piece of candy in your house? It's very hard to like you sometimes. d'you know that?
HECTOR: I know, Bobby. but that's how I feel about you, too. that's why we're friends. we try hard. come on. smoke your pipe.
BOBBY: No. I'll have it in the morning.
HECTOR: Come on. tell me. who would you rather be sitting here with. have a think.
BOBBY: Daniel Boone?
HECTOR: Yeah. He would be a help. but after Daniel Boone.
BOBBY: I can't think of anyone else. but you're impossible to like sometimes.
BOBBY: We should sleep. We've got a lot of running to do in the morning.
HECTOR: No we're not. we're going to talk. all night.
HECTOR: So. where do you want to start?
HECTOR: I know where you want to start.
HECTOR: ( CONTINUED )
BOBBY: Well. what about Alicia?
HECTOR: I'm sorry.
BOBBY: No. I'm sorry.
HECTOR: What do you mean, you're sorry. I'm the one that has to apologize.
BOBBY: Oh no you're not.
BOBBY: Isn't it a beautiful day?
HECTOR: I've said who we are and where we're headed. Want to sign it, write anything?
BOBBY: The peak we logged yesterday. I've named it Nathanial Mountain. After my boy. is that fine with I was going to call it Tobacco Mountain. or Mount Alicia. but Nathaniel's fine.

HECTOR: Three. Is that all right?
BETSY: For a week, maybe.
HECTOR: How about pancakes, Betsy. d'you like pancakes?
BETSY: Not much. why?
HECTOR: I just wondered. Pancakes don't mean much to you?
BETSY: They don't mean a thing. Why?
HECTOR: The mystery of Betsy's pancake dream is evidently lost in infinity. Hector changes the subject.
HECTOR: I thought we could walk into town this morning. I saw the Funfair when we came through last night.
THOMAS: We don't go to Funfairs.
HECTOR: Let's take the walk anyway.

THOMAS: Donald has some shoes.
HECTOR: I don't know if I want to wear Donald's shoes.
THOMAS: Why not?
HECTOR: Wow. Look at this.
HECTOR: Six years ago. Look at that. What's this?
THOMAS: That was the flood. The sea came right up. Donald says it's the icecap melting. It's going to get worse. That's why Mom's selling the place.
HECTOR: It comes up every year?

HECTOR: How do we land these things?
HECTOR: Sure you won't have a pancake,
BETSY: ( CONTINUED )
HECTOR: Okay, first question?
THOMAS: Where have you been?
BETSY: What he means is why did you stay Well, that's a fair question. your mother and I got divorced. you're big enough to remember. she must have told you all that?
HECTOR: Well, that's a fair question. your mother and I got divorced. you're big enough to remember. she must have told you all that?
BETSY: Sure she has. but lots of people get divorced. that doesn't mean they disappear.
HECTOR: You're right. what can I tell you. I went kind of crazy after that, for a good while. I came around a few times. remember?
THOMAS: Not really.
HECTOR: Well, it wasn't easy. everything with her and Donald happened pretty quickly. I missed you both really badly. but for a while I thought I should stay away, until your mother got settled. no, that's not really true. I missed you. but I was kind of crazy at the same time. your mother and I married young. I wasn't used to the freedom. it went to my head . then you moved to New Jersey.
BETSY: It's forty minutes away on a slow You're right, you're right. I don't have too many excuses for the first year. the second year is easier. I was in jail.
HECTOR: You're right, you're right. I don't have too many excuses for the first year. the second year is easier. I was in jail.
THOMAS: What for?
HECTOR: We were doing government work, big contracts. there were some temptations. my boss asked me to shuffle a few papers. there was a lot of money in it. I had to testify against him. it was like killing somebody. Thomas wanted to visit you in jail, but Mom wouldn't let him.
BETSY: Thomas wanted to visit you in jail, but Mom wouldn't let him.
HECTOR: You did?
HECTOR: Well I appreciate that. but I'm glad your mother didn't let you. I'll tell you all about it some day. It was no fun. One year and eight months.
THOMAS: We didn't even know when you got I wasn't in great shape. I sure didn't want you to see me then. so I got back to work. in real estate. found a partner, we met in jail.
HECTOR: I wasn't in great shape. I sure didn't want you to see me then. so I got back to work. in real estate. found a partner, we met in jail.
HECTOR: No. He's a good man, a good man. I like him. I mean it. He's my That's what you do now?
BETSY: That's what you do now?
HECTOR: Yes. We rent apartments. but we want to get into commercial property. people are a nuisance. does that sound bad?
BETSY: How should I know?
HECTOR: Just recently I've been feeling good, things have been going well. and I missed you two. so here we are.
BETSY: What about your girl friend?
HECTOR: Who told you about her?
BETSY: Anna. she's nice. she wants to meet you, real soon. she sells flowers. well, you know that. and on Monday she's probably going to kill me.
HECTOR: Anna. she's nice. she wants to meet you, real soon. she sells flowers. well, you know that. and on Monday she's probably going to kill me.
THOMAS: Betsy thinks that was her at the gas station.
BETSY: Shut up, Tom.
HECTOR: No. heck. no. did you think she was following us?
THOMAS: She's always thinking up stories like that. she never stops.
BETSY: Well, if people don't tell you She's right, Thomas. people should talk more.
HECTOR: She's right, Thomas. people should talk more.
THOMAS: So you haven't been staying away because of us?
HECTOR: What do you mean? Is that what you thought? I was avoiding you two? No. you mustn't think that. that's terrible.
HECTOR: The rain's off. Let's go.
BETSY: I have to ask you something else.
HECTOR: Go on.
BETSY: Why did you leave just two days before my swimming test?
HECTOR: I didn't leave because it was two days before your test. it was just what your mother and I decided. I taught you how to swim. we went to the pool twice a week. why would I leave?
BETSY: I know. that's what I mean. why did you leave just then?
HECTOR: Oh, God, Betsy. I'm sorry.
BETSY: It doesn't matter.
HECTOR: How did you do, in the test?
BETSY: I passed. I'm a life-saver now. Hey, Thomas! We're going home. we're having a barbecue. Betsy said she'll even let me eat a Hurry up, Tom!

BETSY: Hurry up, Tom!
HECTOR: Don't call him Tom, he doesn't like it.
BETSY: I'm allowed.
HECTOR: Your mother said it, when we split up. don't lose the children. didn't mean much at the time. But she was right.
BETSY: Who said I'd let you eat a steak?
HECTOR: Betsy. On Monday will you come with me when I take the flowers back to Anna? I can't face her alone. She wants to meet you You'll be there, right beside me?
BETSY: You'll be there, right beside me?
HECTOR: You'll be there, right beside me?
BETSY: I'd have to take the morning off Is that bad?
HECTOR: Is that bad?
BETSY: No, that could be good.
HECTOR: Just tell them you were with your invisible dad.
BETSY: What's she like? How did you meet her?
HECTOR: The funny thing is I fell in love with her before I ever saw her. I smelled her. It was the day I got out of jail. I was on the train and she was sitting behind me. it was just this incredible perfume. remember I'd been inside for nearly two years with four hundred sweating males. She got off the train and I followed her. I couldn't help it. that's how good she is. she listened to a bum who followed her off a train.
HECTOR: . but she's still going to kill me on Monday.
BETSY: I think I'll paint the sunset It's just like a big pancake up there, isn't it?
HECTOR: It's just like a big pancake up there, isn't it?
HECTOR: I remember when you two were tiny.. I used to watch you sleeping. it was like now. I felt close to you, could touch you. but you weren't there. you were gone. dreamland . just when I was closest to you, you weren't there. I felt it last night, too.
BETSY: That's what it's like. you should know that.
HECTOR: I'm not smart about things like that, usually.
BETSY: Don't be so tough on yourself. You seem to want to be. you don't have to.
HECTOR: No. we can do that.
BETSY: No. we can do that.
HECTOR: Is that a joke?
BETSY: No, I mean it. look out for
HECTOR: Who are you? Who's inside You'll never know.
BETSY: You'll never know.
BETSY: I thought he was taller.
THOMAS: Well, it's been a while. you're I suppose so. He's getting fat, too. I bet I could beat him at the breast-stroke now.
BETSY: I suppose so. He's getting fat, too. I bet I could beat him at the breast-stroke now.
HECTOR: Come on in, kids. that boat doesn't look too safe.
BETSY: We're fine!
HECTOR: I've just found you. I don't want to lose you. What would I tell your mother. come on in.
HECTOR: Throw me the rope, Thomas, I'll pull you in.
HECTOR: This is one useless piece of rope, Thomas.
BETSY: Why does it always go so fast.?
HECTOR: I used to know how to do this.
HECTOR: I did. I used to be really good at this.
HECTOR: Ah. smell it. the smell of civilization. scorched meat.
HECTOR: I'd forgotten that. how you eat. dedicated. like it's your religion!
THOMAS: Things I like.
HECTOR: You used to hum to yourself too, when you ate. like everything was fine with the world.
THOMAS: Hey, so I did. I'd forgotten about that.
HECTOR: There she is. old Mercury.
THOMAS: No. Mercury doesn't rise 'til after midnight. that's Jupiter.
HECTOR: I'd forgotten. we used to watch the stars. you could tell me the names of all the planets. you could recite them like a poem. remember. at the tiny window upstairs in the old house?
THOMAS: Oh well, not to worry. I'm glad you still like astronomy though.
HECTOR: Oh well, not to worry. I'm glad you still like astronomy though.
THOMAS: I'm not into star-gazing so much . we're working on computer modelling. we're trying to make a biosphere.
HECTOR: A self-sustaining life system. for inter-stellar travel. But we always get a methane build up, it doesn't matter what we do.
THOMAS: A self-sustaining life system. for inter-stellar travel. But we always get a methane build up, it doesn't matter what we do.
HECTOR: This is at school?
THOMAS: Yeah. We're making such a mess of the world, one day we're going to have to take off for somewhere Sounds like Donald said that.
HECTOR: Sounds like Donald said that.
HECTOR: Well, I'm glad you two are thinking about the old planet. I'm proud of you. Look how beautiful everything is. Sometimes I think it's people that make it all wrong. we walk around with all our problems.
BETSY: I don't know. If it wasn't for us there'd be nobody around to see it all.
HECTOR: Don't worry, you two. I'll tell you. it's just a big, black sheet up there with holes in it so the light comes through. that's the truth. the very
BETSY: Wait a minute. I know. the whole universe is inside a speck of dust that's lying in a ball of fluff in the cuff of a pair of pants hanging over the back of a No. I'll tell you. the whole thing. stars and everything. is sitting on the skin of a bubble of milk in a bowl of cornflakes. and somebody's just about to eat
HECTOR: No. I'll tell you. the whole thing. stars and everything. is sitting on the skin of a bubble of milk in a bowl of cornflakes. and somebody's just about to eat
BETSY: Skimmed milk.
THOMAS: You don't get bubbles in skimmed Okay. it's half-and-half.
HECTOR: Okay. it's half-and-half.
BETSY: I've got a better one. we're all inside a speck of pollen that's stuck to the wing of a bee while it sits on a flower.
HECTOR: Don't mention flowers, Betsy. please, not tonight.
HECTOR: I have an idea, Betsy. we're inside a pancake. what d'you Why are you always talking about pancakes. what's wrong with you?
