GILL: Still need a lift?
RONNIE: Yeah. Transmission's shot.

RONNIE: INT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - MORNING Ronnie is vomiting into the toilet as Rae rubs his head. Each painful dry heave makes Rae comfort him more.
RAE: EXT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - MORNING Ronnie places his duffle bag in Gill's truck. Rae begins to Rae doesn't answer. Gill backs away, allowing Ronnie and Rae some privacy. The two lovers stare into each others eyes and then embrace. Rae peeks over Ronnie's shoulder at Gill with an expression of dread. Anger seizes her.
GILL: You sick?
RAE: This ain't gonna work.
RONNIE: I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
RAE: I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.

RAE: Tears come to her. She's not going to be able to stop it.
RAE: Goddammit, Ronnie.
GODDAMMIT!: Rae is gripping the watch around her wrist for comfort. Her breathing is already out of her control. The dizziness is already upon her. The familiar burning. She inhales in gasps, rocking back and forth on her knees. The late morning cicadas chirp in an undulating frenzy.
RAE: ( shaking her head ) ( meaning "no" ) Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
RAE: MM-MM! MM-MM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
RAE: We're done, right?

NIGHT: Lazarus's blues is all we hear as four guys chase Rae through the woods. She is in her shirt and panties, wearing football shoulder pads. She is completely wasted. Lost. The ground rocks back and forth with each step. Trees pass in a slow-motion haze.

RAE: ( screaming )
HELP!: Laz watches as the coil unravels and snaps taut, yanking on the old radiator. Clank! The chain whips Rae down to the ground. Laz watches as dust flies of the radiator with each tug.
RAE: The fear in Laz's face is replaced with a grin as he watches his radiator hold firm.
SOMEBODY!: The fear in Laz's face is replaced with a grin as he watches his radiator hold firm.
CLANK!: The fear in Laz's face is replaced with a grin as he watches his radiator hold firm.

LAZARUS: Whose doin' is that?
RAE: Okay. OKAY! I'M COMIN' IN! NOW

LAZARUS: Say we talk. Just take a seat on the sofa. I'll get us somethin' cool to
LAZARUS: You may not remember. But you spent a whole half day in my tub, tryin' to cool down. Melted four ice trays.

LAZARUS: No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
RAE: ( shaking her head ) Hm-mm. Hm-mm.
LAZARUS: I said. STOP!
RAE: ( on the verge of crying )
I CAN'T!: Rae gets dizzy. She rests the top of her head on the floor and sways back and forth. Laz rushes out the front door. As the wave hits, Rae twists and turns, wrapping the chain around her. She grips the radiator with both hands and rests her face against the side.
RAE: Hmmmmmm. Stop-it!. STOP-IT!
LAZARUS: You hungry?
LAZARUS: I put some back ache into growin' them greens. You should slow down and see how they taste.

LAZARUS: Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
RAE: ( sassy ) If I break one you gonna shoot me?
LAZARUS: My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
RAE: Laz moves in close and starts applying antibacterial cream to the cut above Rae's eye.
LAZARUS: Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' Sting a bit?
RAE: Means ya healin'. So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns. you know the story?
LAZARUS: Means ya healin'. So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns. you know the story?
RAE: Laz starts putting the cream on her scabbed knees. He rubs them gently.
LAZARUS: The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God. and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
RAE: I know. I get it. What's Matthew Gal. Matthew ain't doin' shit. this just a story. Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in. Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman. who joins in union with Almighty God. or man. in the sanctity of marriage. should degrade herself. and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
LAZARUS: Gal. Matthew ain't doin' shit. this just a story. Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in. Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman. who joins in union with Almighty God. or man. in the sanctity of marriage. should degrade herself. and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!

RAE: Enough to choke a Goddamn horse.
LAZARUS: I'm needin' some women's clothes. A few dresses. Maybe some shoes. But they gotta be nice. They gotta be proper. Clothes a woman would want, where she could feel and look like a woman without. you know, lookin' like a tramp or a hussy or somethin'.
ELLA MAE: And, sir. do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
LAZARUS: ( points to Rhonda ) That young lady's size, right'cher.
ELLA MAE: Well, that makes it easier.
ELLA MAE: Well. I hope these will work for your niece. She can always come back in and swap sizes.
LAZARUS: Mind I ask, what's all this business These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
ELLA MAE: These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
LAZARUS: For your hands?
ELLA MAE: Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin. This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend. applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So. perhaps just after a shower.
LAZARUS: ( likes what he smells ) I'll take a jar of that, too.
LAZARUS: Lookin' for Miss Angela.
GIRL: She in the back.
ANGELA: Wait right there.
LAZARUS: I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.

LAZARUS: I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
LAZARUS: Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
LAZARUS: Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.

RAE: You a preacher?
RAE: Can I ask you a question? People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and. and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
RAE: But that's so fuckin' stupid. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
RAE: You can't hurt people. and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who. do what they want and then. switch.

RONNIE: This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
GILL: She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
RONNIE: I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared. .and run.

RONNIE!: Laz spins around knocking away Ronnie's arm. BAM! The gun fires into the wall. The guitar cracks on the floor. Rae screams.
RAE: RONNIE STOP! RONNIE!
RAE: Ronnie looks up at Rae, his eyes red with sorrow and rage. He pushes the gun to the side of Laz's head. Rae cries.

LAZARUS: Go'on. Do it.
DO IT!: The last shout from Laz completely destroys Ronnie. His shoulders slump. The gun lowers in his grasp. A low sob is heard as he falls to his knees. Laz snatches the gun from his hand and stands.
RAE: Rae inches closer to Ronnie as he kneels over and weeps. She gently touches his shoulder. He turns his anguished face to her and tries to speak.
RONNIE: I can't stop. I can't stop. being scared. What am I gonna do.
RAE: I got you, baby. I got you. What are you doing? You gonna call the cops? You think they gonna help this? They ever help you, Laz? Huh?

LAZARUS: Thought you knew me better, gal. I need you at my house. right now.
RONNIE: I hate this town. You can't round the corner without bumping into someone who's got your number. We did a lot of dreamin', me and Rae. Makin' plans to get out. I'd do my tour and. we'd move outta here. Go to Chattanooga. And I'd work for my uncle. But. when Rae gets like she does. And she does the things that she always done. Makes me feel like she loves this place more'n me.
RONNIE: All my life people called me shit like, sissy and. nervous and. I got few things in my life that make me feel like. like.
LAZARUS: Like a man.
RONNIE: ( surprised ) Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
RAE: It starts like this. fire. that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out. then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was. was. when I met Ronnie. Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him. it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
RAE: I think. I think we're fucked up. Both of us. I know I am. But. that don't mean what I feel ain't true. It don't mean I can't love. And I know, how I been is. is. REALLY BAD! So if you want to quit on me. I understand. But please. please.

LINCOLN: You havin' trouble with that tie? Cuz I'm pretty good at it.
LINCOLN: Gotta do it like this or I get all turned around.
ANGELA: She's ready for you.
LAZARUS: Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?

LAZARUS: Now. let's stop that. You and me. we can handle this. You hear me, gal? We gonna be just fine. Now live ya life. Pull your shit together and live your life.
RAE: R.L.'s words are heard as Rae wraps her arms around Laz and rests her head on his chest.
RAE: I don't want you to let go.
LAZARUS: Maybe I won't.
LAZARUS: I do.
LAZARUS: You got her now? Ronnie. Rae. I want you to look at each other and listen to me carefully. Do you understand?
RONNIE: I gotta pull over.
RONNIE: ( through clenched teeth )
FUCK!: Fear comes to Rae's face as she notices her middle finger scratching at the back of Ronnie's neck. She pulls it away and shoves her hand between her thighs. Her eyes close as the burning builds. She grips the gold chain around her waist.
FLASH TO: QUICK CUTS The chain, tight around Rae as she struggles. Rae panting and sweating on Laz's floor. She reaches out. Her hand lands on the strings of his guitar. A single string is plucked.
QUICK CUTS: The chain, tight around Rae as she struggles. Rae panting and sweating on Laz's floor. She reaches out. Her hand lands on the strings of his guitar. A single string is plucked.

RAE: ( singing ) You'll never know dear, how much I love you. Please don't take, my sunshine away.
RAE: See. We're okay.
