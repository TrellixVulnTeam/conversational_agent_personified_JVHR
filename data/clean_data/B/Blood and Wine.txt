ALEX: ( ADVANCING )
YOUNG MAN: You scared me, man. A middle-aged man, a REPO MAN, calls out lazily from behind the wheel.
REPO MAN: This is not your car, sir. This car belongs to the Star Leasing Company. Alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though he's rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a higher wattage than the security lights.
REPO MAN: I can collect either the money or the car. Given how much you owe, I figure it's the car. The younger man has almost hacked through the chain.
ALEX: Pop the. trunk.
REPO MAN: We inventory the property at the He keeps his eye on the chain, ready to gun the engine as soon as the exit is clear.

LANDING UPSTAIRS: SUZANNE ( O .S=.. ) Now what are you arguing about?
SUZANNE: is a pretty young woman in her late thirties with a sense of humor and irony. She's chemically relaxed, but not stupefied. She pulls a robe around herself, modest in front of her son; and although her body's not spectacular, like Gabriella's, she has a trim. athletic build.

ALEX: ( SLEEPILY )
SUZANNE: ( watching the tape ) The beaches I thought we had a beach. I read how the hotels keep spotters on the roof with scopes, to keep thieves away from the guests. They can look at every inch of your body through the scope. ( with a low laugh ) Do you mind that I like that? Alex? He has fallen asleep. Tenderly she draws the sheet to his shoulder and settles down to watch the rest of the tape.

GABRIELLA: Yes, Mrs. Reese.
GABRIELLA: Right there. She slides off the stool.

Gabriella is tucking in her T-shirt. She closes the closet door. Jason's VOICE is closer, more impatient, at the bottom of the stairs.

GABRIELLA: How old were you?
JASON: Eight. I'd just turned eight. She takes his hand. He tightens his fingers through hers and looks out at the horizon, trying to control the emotions her sympathy has roiled. Gabriella senses this. She puts her arms around him, kisses him on the cheek. They stand, holding each other. Then Jason, on impulse, kisses her on the lips.
VICTOR: ( BREATHING OUT )
ALEX: What the fuck are you doing??
VICTOR: I always take a photograph of the goods. To avoid any disagreement in the sale. The insurance photo is hopeless. You ask yourself how do they stay in business. Alex advances on him.

ALEX: What's this supposed to be?
VICTOR: I thought it over. I can't move it. I'm on parole. I'm known. You're not. So you'll fly to Newark, take a shuttle into the city, catch a cab, take a walk, find an address, I'll give you the name pas.de probleme, as they say in Bordeaux. He's being condescending.'
ALEX: Meaning you're too chickenshit to do it yourself.
VICTOR: Maybe I am. All right, I am.

GABRIELLA: I am not taking my clothes off.
JASON: ( flustered, irritated ) That's not what I meant.

CASH: 66 EXT. BOAT - DAY Jason is sprawled half across Gabriella on the deck of the- boat, a seat cushion under her head. He has his hand in her panties. She clutches his wrist and pulls his hand back into sight. He lifts his head to look at her.
GABRIELLA: ( SOFTLY )
JASON: You waited long enough to tell me. Gabriella arranges her clothes.
GABRIELLA: ( FLARING )
JASON: No, you're not. She scrambles to her feet.
GABRIELLA: I want to go back now. Can we go back, please?
JASON: . Sure. He stands up and moves to the helm, his legs stiff with injured dignity. Gabriella sits down on the bench, the cushion clutched in front of her. Jason sneaks a look back at her. With her hair wet and her makeup washed away, she looks younger than he does. She's resting her chin on the edge of the cushion. He switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over the anchor, engages the power winch. The CHAIN starts to

ALEX: Napa. I got a problem with a supplier. Boutique wineries they're all owned by ex-lawyers.
SUZANNE: Via New York? She holds up the tickets.
ALEX: I need to see the wholesaler.
SUZANNE: You're amazing, you really are. Now how are you going to explain 'Miss Honey, I don't have to. I will, out of courtesy. It's Mrs., and she's fifty years old, Suzanne. She's the God, I could even believe you, if I wanted to.
ALEX: Honey, I don't have to. I will, out of courtesy. It's Mrs., and she's fifty years old, Suzanne. She's the God, I could even believe you, if I wanted to.
SUZANNE: God, I could even believe you, if I wanted to.
ALEX: ( HARDER )
SUZANNE: I put Terry's life insurance money into that store and you spend it on your goddamn girlfriends while my checks bounce. Alex whirls around at the bottom of the stairs.
ALEX: I worked my ass off for you with that store. Eight years of twelve- hour days and one-day weekends! So don't tell me I haven't treated you He picks his jacket up off the floor and shrugs it on. Suzanne snatches his car keys off the coffee table. Infuriated, he grabs for his keys, but she holds them away behind her back.
SUZANNE: You're going to talk to me!
ALEX: When I get back.
SUZANNE: With more of your fucking lies! I hate you! Wasting my ( slapping at his arm with her free hand ) Sssh, calm down She tries to slap him again, but he gets hold of her hand.

SUZANNE: That's all you ever do! He twists her hand up behind her back, forcing her onto the sofa.
SUZANNE: Go to hell! He smothers her into the cushion and twists her hand up and up. She grips his keys tighter.
ALEX: ( breathless from the
STRUGGLE ): Open your hand, Suzanne. Pinning her down, he painfully pries open her fingers. She drives her elbow into his face.
SUZANNE: You sonofabitch! He hits her back, her nose starts to gush, the keys drop to the-floor. He bends to pick them up. Suzanne seizes a standing metal ashtray and savagely swipes him across the temple.
ALEX: hasn't moved. Suzanne drops to her knees beside him and squeamishly lifts his wallet out of his pocket, snatches the cash, lets the wallet fall back beside him. Her breathing is so rapid and shallow it sounds like whimpers.
JASON: Hey, hey.
SUZANNE: ( FRANTIC )
LEAVINGS: He sees the blood smeared all over her face, her clothe:,, and charges past her.
SUZANNE: - JA-SONII
JASON: What the hell happened in there?
SUZANNE: Is he dead?
JASON: Not enough. What'd you hit him -+ The ashtray.
SUZANNE: -+ The ashtray.

JASON: We'll head for the Gulf, see what we He sounds like her contemporary, not her kid.
SUZANNE: . I remember your dad saying the sand was as white as the whites of God's eyes, on the Gulf.
JASON: Do you still miss him? Slowly she shakes her head no.
SUZANNE: I can't see his face anymore. I can't hear his voice.
VICTOR: Mugged-by your wife. How ironic.
ALEX: I'll fucking kill her.
VICTOR: When do the Reeses come home?
ALEX: Not for a month. Plenty of time. Victor sighs.
VICTOR: How long a drive is it?
ALEX: To the Gulf? Three hours. He removes the towel from his head.
VICTOR: You're going to need stitches. Do you have a sewing kit?
ALEX: I'll stop at my doctor's.
VICTOR: I darned my own socks in prison.
JASON: Order something for me, okay? I'm stiff, I need to walk around. He's already walking away. Concern and exasperation cancel each other; she goes inside.
JASON: My grandmother asked me to bring in a necklace of hers Jason takes the velvet pouch out of his pocket, unlaces it, spreads out the necklace on the counter. He leans forward on his elbows while the jeweler examines it with a loupe. When the jeweler looks up, he's angry.
JEWELER: Your grandmother lets you carry around a million dollars worth of jewelry? Go put it back where you found it. The jeweler pours the necklace back in the pouch, cinches it closed, slaps it on top of the case.
JASON: Those aren't real diamonds.
JEWELER: Tell your grandmother to bring it The jeweler BUZZES the door to release it. Jason grabs the velvet pouch, strides out.
WAITRESS: pan san, strawberry waffle, eggs over, side of wheat toast, ham steak, hash browns, fruit cup, two O.J.'s,, coffee, milk

JASON: We'll starve. The waitress laughs as she strolls away.
SUZANNE: I'm hungry. He's worried about the jeweler.
JASON: Let's pack it up, picnic on the beach someplace.
SUZANNE: ( with a grin ) What a romantic.
JASON: He wants to tell her he took the necklace.
MOM: He wants to tell her he took the necklace.
SUZANNE: ( BREEZILY )
SUZANNE: I feel. exhilarated.
JASON: Adrenalin does that.
SUZANNE: It ain't adrenalin, it's freedom. And she slips her wedding ring off her finger and hurls it overhand as far as she can. It drops into the sea.
SUZANNE: ( EXULTANT )
HISS: She eats with gusto. Jason is staring at the water.
JASON: I can't believe you did that.
SUZANNE: You're quiet. She doesn't think he's going to answer her.
JASON: I didn't even say goodbye.
SUZANNE: It'll work itself out. People manage. We're here. This is what you always wanted.
JASON: How much money do we have? Suzanne doesn't reply.

SUZANNE: ( SMILING )
SUZANNE: ( CALLING )
OWNER: ( ENVIOUSLY )
SUZANNE: He's my son. The owner gives her a startled glance.
OWNER: You look great! Suzanne laughs.
SUZANNE: She sits up in bed. Jason comes in from outside.
JASON: I'm right here. Suzanne shoves her fingers through her damp hair, swallows to clear her voice.
SUZANNE: . I dreamed I was in jail. You'd come to see me, you were on the other side of the plastic like at the bank?. And you were talking, but I couldn't hear you. I put my ear to the holes and I couldn't hear you, but your mouth was moving.
JASON: What dog? She lies down again.
JASON: ( GENTLY )
VICTOR: eight-faceted cut. quite unique. could be the whole piece or individual stones, preference for the whole piece. Will you put out the word?.
VICTOR: I've called the whole network of fences from here to Tampa.
ALEX: Let's hope we'll find her before she Victor picks up a chair and smacks it down.
ALEX: Hey! What's wrong?
VICTOR: This is not a water-view suite in Marbella! Did you notice? There's no fruit and champagne from the management. I don't see Swiss chocolate on the pillows. My masseuse is not at the door. And I am fucking dying, Alex!
ALEX: ( SHOCKED )
VICTOR: I don't intend to cough to death in a county clinic because you screwed That's not fair. The plan was for you to move the necklace. I wouldn't have had the goddamn thing. Come on. sit down. try to relax. He reaches for victor's cigarettes and crumples the package in his fist. Victor looks at his ruined smokes.
ALEX: ( QUIETLY )
VICTOR: I'm not good at giving up things.
SUZANNE: her hair a better, brighter color under her chef's hat, is cooking on the grill behind the counter, kidding the customers, enjoying herself. The greasy-aproned OWNER pats her rump as he goes by, not for the first time.
SUZANNE: Long arms, short dick, they always One of the Fishermen guffaws. The owner looks pissed. So does Jason who witnessed it all.
OWNER: ( aside; to Suzanne ) Can I see you in the office after lunch, please?
SUZANNE: ( NOT INTIMIDATED )
SUZANNE: I was not-fired, you jerk. I quit.
JASON: ( concentrating on the
WORK ): You did the right thing.
JASON: Do you buy estate diamonds?
JEWELER: Jason takes out a zip-lock bag and lays it on the counter, one of the diamonds inside. The jeweler takes it out with respect and holds it under his loupe. If Jason's nervous, it doesn't show.
JASON: It belonged to my mother. The jeweler's heard every version. He doesn't care.
SUZANNE: ( CALLING OUT )
SUZANNE: ( as he reaches her ) . Look at you. What's the Jason squats down beside her and balls up the classifieds.
JASON: You don't need another grab-ass job. I been out talking to peoplel

MAN: Hey, I thought you were coming back She smiles and waves goodbye.
SUZANNE: . Too bad. I kinda liked that
VICTOR: Seen them, by any chance?
BARTENDER: Why are you asking?
VICTOR: My wife and son. He's been selling fish around these parts. He's totally believable. The bartender feels for his pain and takes another look at the photo, shakes his head no.
BARTENDER: She's a little classier than our usual clientele, y'know?
VICTOR: Maybe you could pass it down anyway.
BARTENDER: Sure, man.
VICTOR: joins Alex in the booth. Victor raises his hand. Alex instinctively pulls his head back.
VICTOR: Don't move. He leans across the table and plucks the last stitch out of Alex's wound. Alex winces.
VICTOR: It's been irritating me all day. Did I hurt you? Threat implied. Alex stares him down.
HENRY: Hunches a catch like a depth finder. Victor is already out of the booth.
HENRY: Who are you?
VICTOR: His father.
HENRY: I thought his father was dead. ( shaking his head ) Well, you look bad all right, but not dead.
VICTOR: ( DEFENSIVELY ) ( CONTINUED ) 116 CONTINUED: ( 2 )
HENRY: ( with a chuckle ) Oh, man, now I see why he blew town. victor's insulted enough to lose his patience and his The question before us is where did he go. Henry says nothing.

VICTOR: The question before us is where did he go. Henry says nothing. He wants to be paid. Victor whips out a fifty-dollar bill from his top pocket. Henry reaches for it, but victor holds it back, wanting an answer first.
HENRY: He wouldn't be on the Gulf. He hated the Gulf. Alex has moved up to the bar to listen behind him, unnoticed. He shakes his head at victor.
HENRY: He's down in the Keys somewhere. Victor puts the fifty back in his own pocket. Henry stands aggressively.
HENRY: That ain't cool in my book! In a swift, unexpected move, victor jams Henry back down on his bar stool. The bartender starts toward them. Alex slips out the door. The stool and Henry are toppling over. Victor catches them both, sets Henry upright.
VICTOR: ( EVENLY )
VICTOR: Thank you.
ALEX: ( PLEASED )
VICTOR: I never understand your optimism.
ALEX: Or he wouldn't have lied.
ALEX: ( TO VICTOR )
HENRY: is in the doorway to the bar.
HENRY: What's it to you if I see the kid? Victor smiles.
JASON: ( just to be sure ) The cabin is silent. He uses his fishing knife to pop loose a section of the cheap wall paneling. Behind it, a square of sheet rock has been sliced away between the studs to accommodate the pouch. He drops the pouch in his tackle box. A CAR is heard pulling up. Jason frantically starts to jam the paneling back in place. It won't hold.
SUZANNE: ( CASUALLY )
SUZANNE: Nice boat. ( over her shoulder ) Are you allowed just to run around with it? 'His tension ebbs. He picks up his tackle box.
JASON: I forgot my tackle box.
SUZANNE: Don't take advantage, Jason. They trusted you with the job.
JASON: It's not a problem. He escapes out the door.
GABRIELLA: She's greedily grateful to hear Alex's voice.
GABRIELLA: Hi! I saw on the news there's rain in San Francisco. Are you wet and miserable?
ALEX: Napa's farther north. Victor comes out of the bathroom. He's waiting for news.
GABRIELLA: Tell me you love me.
GABRIELLA: Who just laughed?
ALEX: She wants to talk to you.
VICTOR: Oh, please. Why?
ALEX: Just fucking say hello, okay? Victor takes the phone.
VICTOR: Hello, dear. Alex snatches the phone back from him.
ALEX: Happy? Satisfied? I'm working.
GABRIELLA: I miss you.
GABRIELLA: It's lonely here. There's no return address. She slits it open with her thumbnail. A trickle of sand falls out.
GABRIELLA: I'm looking! Instead, she opens the letter.
GABRIELLA: Here it is. Mr. Raines called from ( NAME OF TOWN ). He said you-Id know what it was about. Do you,- need the 131 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 131 Sitting up, Alex signals success to Victor and writes down the number.

NEAR THE: Modest, nondescript. Victor parallel parks jewelry store with his usual careful manner.
VICTOR: ( LAUGHING )
ALEX: You all right?
VICTOR: A lot of these jewelers might know my face. It's risky.
ALEX: How about for me? Victor takes out the photo of Alex with the necklace and holds it up for him.
VICTOR: Nobody's seen this yet.
ALEX: You're sick. I'll do it. Alex throws open the door and barrels out of the car.
Â¢ 135: 135 INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY The jeweler who bought the diamond from Jason lays it on a velvet pad for Alex, who's posing as the insurance ( with a shrug ) Said it was his mother's.
JEWELER: ( with a shrug ) Said it was his mother's.
ALEX: A seventeen-year-old kid waltzes in with a diamond as big as your toenail, and you don't wonder?? You shouldn't have touched iti You know that! All right, okay. When we recover the rest of the necklace, I'll be back. Do not, do not sell it. I'll see what I can do for you, i appreciate that.
JEWELER: i appreciate that.
ALEX: Smart lady. She lets Jason make the sale. They get caught, he's underage, and she don't know a thing. I gotta give her credit.
VICTOR: You have interesting taste in women. Alex's gaze wanders to the game, but he can't get 137 EXT. VICTOR'S CAR - DAY It barrels up the highway, passing the same landmarks Suzanne and Jason did.

JASON: ( PARANOID )
HENRY: Right here, man. I ain't been eating my share since my fishing partner ran off. Without so much as goodbye/good luck. Jason blows out a breath.
JASON: It's complicated.
HENRY: ( NODDING )
JASON: So why are you on the Gulf?
HENRY: My baby finally sank on me. Right at the dock. I thought I'd work charter for awhile. ( moving to help Jason with the latches ) Need a crew?

HIS HAND: wraps around the concealed pouch and withdraws, reassured.
JASON: secures the engine hatch.
HENRY: A guy offered me fifty bucks to tell him where you were. Sick old motherfucker. Big as God. Tried to say he was your stepfather.
JASON: ( CAREFULLY )
HENRY: No, no, no, no this guy was not any kind of family man, if you know what I mean. So you're in some deep shit, because he wasn't a cop Henry chuckles.
JASON: What'd you tell him? Henry chuckles.
HENRY: Lots of ways to make fifty bucks. Misunderstanding, Jason shoves him up against the counter.
JASON: You gonna lean on me, Henry?? Is that the plan? Henry is hurt and offended.
HENRY: ( WITH DIGNITY )
HENRY: You um you moving contraband, Jason shakes his head no.
HENRY: This guy struck me as a serious A few raindrops spatter the windows. Jason makes for the cabin door.

JASON: Mom, come on. He catches her hand and tows her toward the back door.
SUZANNE: ( ALARMED )
JASON: We"gotta go. She anxiously follows him out the door.
THE CUSTOMER: leans back to see around the snack rack that blocked our view of him. It's Victor. A paper bag under his arm, he goes out the front door.
VICTOR: reaches his car with a long stride; he can't run.
SUZANNE: . I should have gone through his pockets myself. It didn't occur to me. I was in such a panic. If I'd found the necklace, Jason? I'd have taken it, too.
ALEX: 148 INT. SUZANNE'S CAR - NIGHT As she accelerates, Suzanne reaches over to pat Jason's She glances in the rear view mirror. Headlights.

HER POV: A small bridge ahead is almost ready to pivot to let a boat pass. She stamps down on the gas pedal. The car rockets forward.
VICTOR: What a thrill.
THEIR POV: Jason's white face is turned toward them in Suzanne's car.
ALEX: Easy, easy he'll see us.
VICTOR: It's raining too hard.
JASON: Still with us.
SUZANNE: Maybe it's just a tourist cruising around with his head up his butt. Neither of them believes that.
SUZANNE: . How about Mexico? The Sea of Cortez? Your father fished for marlin there. The biggest catch he ever had.
ALEX: Relax. She's not going anywhere. He brakes and calmly reverses in the rain.

JASON: Mom! Face the road! You're She looks back as now bright headlights light them up. A truck HORN BLASTS.
SUZANNE: She 'spins the wheel to avoid a head-on, but in so doing she clips the curb and loses control. She throws an arm across Jason to protect him.
VICTOR: We don't have much time. Through the window they can see Suzanne and Jason, both unconscious, limbs entangled, covered in glass. Suzanne is hemorrhaging from a gash in her side. Her leg twitches in spasm. Car headlights pass by on the road.
ALEX: We need to get some help!
VICTOR: Already on the way, I'm afraid.
VICTOR: Open the trunk, please.
ALEX: Oh, Christ. He lifts her shirt to see how badly she's cut and presses the heel of his hand against the gash to try to stop the bleeding. Her blood spurts through his fingers. With his other hand he pats down her body.
SUZANNE: ( BARELY CONSCIOUS )
ALEX: I think he's okay, Suzanne. Just' tell me where it is. She can't answer. He opens the glove compartment and feels inside. He goes through her purse.
ALEX: Leaning over the seat, he fumbles with her clothes. He's trying to make her comfortable.

GABRIELLA: ( her eyes on his knife ) Don't hurt me. Please.
JASON: Where is he?
GABRIELLA: He went to get you! He's not coming back until tomorrow. She timidly pulls the sheet over her body. Jason yanks it off her so hard it flaps loose from the corners. He touches her belly with the length of his knife, the blade â¢ flat to her skin. She freezes.
JASON: His car's here.
GABRIELLA: It's been here since he went to I keep hearing about Napa. Did you ever call him there? She shakes her head.

JASON: I'm not crazy. Gabriella lays her hand over his on the bed, to comfort . I'm so very sorry about what happened to your mother. His hand skitters away and lights on her ribs.
GABRIELLA: . I'm so very sorry about what happened to your mother. His hand skitters away and lights on her ribs.
JASON: Her loss, your gain. Furious, Gabriella forgets her caution. She slaps him hard enough to throw his head sideways. Jason rolls on top of her and pins her down.
JASON: Her home, her bed her life. He lowers his mouth to Gabriella's neck. His kiss is surprisingly gentle. His knee works her legs apart.
GABRIELLA: . Don't do this for revenge.
JASON: Let's finish what we started. Slowly, he kisses her. She lets her mouth respond: a sweet kiss, in spite of the circumstances. His fingers scissor her nipple.
JASON: Just don't tell me that you love me. He peels off his T-shirt.
GABRIELLA: ( in a whisper ) I love you. He gives her a hard look. She holds his gaze and pushes his jeans down until he finally kicks them off and they're both naked. They begin to make love.
GABRIELLA: Jason doesn't understand. She gently pushes him back.
GABRIELLA: This way. She turns on her stomach and guides him back into her. Jason moves now rapidly.
GABRIELLA: Her hand on his ass guides the pace. She hasn't had a young man in a long time.
GABRIELLA: ( IN SPANISH )
GABRIELLA: Will you get me a towel? With warm He kisses her and gets up. If she didn't love him before, she does now.
GABRIELLA: ( after a moment ) Are you going to kill me, too?
JASON: ( REPELLED )
GABRIELLA: You'll have to. I'll know. I'll be a witness. I'll know you planned
JASON: Would you do that?
GABRIELLA: ( SOFTLY )
GABRIELLA: I need him, Jason.
JASON: ( FURIOUS )
GABRIELLA: I'm not going back to Caracas! You don't know how we live there. She pulls the pillow in front of her to hide her nakedness. He touches her shoulder; she shrugs him away.
GABRIELLA: ( GROWING FRANTIC )
JASON: What are you talking about? This is my home. I'm home. She stares at him. His face is set. She can't persuade him. Jason thinks of his next step, a plan.
GABRIELLA: ( COLDLY )
JASON: You're never going to marry him, Watch me. He closes the door with a solid CLICK. She starts to cry, and still crying, she pulls the sheets off the bed, she has to change the sheets.
GABRIELLA: Watch me. He closes the door with a solid CLICK. She starts to cry, and still crying, she pulls the sheets off the bed, she has to change the sheets.
ALEX: ( as he goes in ) 182 INT. CONDO - DAY Alex is too astonished to say a word. Jason and Gabriella are having lunch at the kitchen table.
ALEX: I've been looking for you for two Jason relishes this.
JASON: You should've called home. Alex advances.
ALEX: How'd you get here?
JASON: ( too bright and
GABRIELLA: ( too bright and
NERVOUS ): Are you-hungry? Have you had lunch? Alex doesn't even hear her.
ALEX: Why didn't you wait for me? Jason eats without answering.
ALEX: And what about all your stuff, and your mother's? Jason swallows, wipes his mouth.
JASON: She doesn't need it anymore, and I don't want it. Gabriella brings Alex a cup of coffee.
GABRIELLA: How about a sandwich?
ALEX: ( SNAPPISHLY )
JASON: You haven't even said hello to her.
ALEX: ( with great control ), Hello, Gabby.
JASON: ( PROMPTING HIM )
ALEX: What are you doing. Jason gets up from the table. He's wearing workout He walks out of the condo. Alex and Gabriella are left alone together. She jumps in before he can say anything.
JASON: He walks out of the condo. Alex and Gabriella are left alone together. She jumps in before he can say anything.
GABRIELLA: He just lost his mother, Alex. You can't expect him to act normal. He steps up beside her and moves her hair off her Did you try to make him feel better?
ALEX: ( GENTLY )
GABRIELLA: ( right back at him ) Yes. I gave him sonlething to eat. She walks out and up the stairs to the bedroom.
GABRIELLA: ( SOFTLY )
GABRIELLA: I wanted her to go away so bad. I used to wish she'd die. And then she did. He lets go of her hand.
ALEX: Oh,. please. I don't need two children in the house. ( noticing her mouth ) What happened to your mouth? Gabriella's hand jumps to her lip.
GABRIELLA: Oh. -I bit my lip. He takes her lip between his and nuzzles it.
ALEX: ( TENDERLY )
ALEX: ( CONVERSATIONALLY )
ALEX: You have something that belongs to .me, Jason and I want it back.
JASON: It's not yours.
ALEX: ( HARDER )
JASON: Did you know the thing's worth over a million dollars? What a fucking stupid way to spend money.
ALEX: I was holding it for someone. These are dangerous people.
ALEX: Don't screw around with me, Jason. He's in a position to crush Jason's windpipe. Jason shoves the barbell up in his face, finishing the set and re-racking. He reaches for his towel and wipes his face, his expression hidden.
JASON: I don't know where it is anymore. You killed the only person who did.
ALEX: It was an accident! What did I have to do with it? Jason wads up his towel and throws it at Alex.
JASON: There was a car following us!
ALEX: Did you see who was in it? Jason shakes his head no.
ALEX: I met one of these guys. Tall, weird-looking fucker with.a gray ( letting out a breath ) These people you don't steal from. Whoever was following Suzanne is going to come after you, too. Haven't you figured that out? For the first time Jason wavers.; it's a plausible alternative, but one that makes him guilty instead.
JASON: Who are they? Alex fastidiously drops the towel in the hamper.
ALEX: Doesn't matter. Give the necklace back to me, and we'll split the handling commission. His ingratiating smile offends Jason. He doesn't trust Alex. He shakes his head.
JASON: She never told me where she kept it. Alex doesn't believe him either. His hand. rests on a dumbbell, and for a murderous instant he's about to pick it up and use it on Jason. He lifts his hand away.
VICTOR: Nice boy like that, the money means diddlyshit. And, personally, I suspect he'd rather die than tell you. So get a blowtorch, and use it on the girl until he cooperates.
ALEX: He's gonna make a move.
ALEX: He hangs up and rocks back in his chair.
ALEX: ( muffled against her
SKIN ): I'm never leaving you again. He starts to caress her.
GABRIELLA: I'm already asleep, honey.
ALEX: ( LIGHTLY )
GABRIELLA: Can he hear us? Alex's tone turns. Jason is causing him another problem.
ALEX: I think he's probably figured out why we sleep in the same bed, Gabby.
Â¢ GABRIELLA: He misses his mother.
ALEX: . So do I. Gabriella props herself up on her elbow.
GABRIELLA: ALEX . I wish she was alive and happy and someplace else. Gabriella lies down again and makes herself comfortable against him. He tries again to interest her body.
ALEX: We need to go somewhere, just us.
GABRIELLA: I'm buying a vineyard in France. Have you ever been to Paris?
ALEX: I'm buying a vineyard in France. Have you ever been to Paris?
GABRIELLA: Alex scoots down next to her, his hand takes possession of her ass.
ALEX: We'll stay at the Ritz, we'll eat our way through every three-star restaurant in town a new dress every night would you like that? Gabriella laughs in wonder and turns onto her side to face him. They fit themselves together like an old married ( getting caught up in his own fantasy ) We'll drive down through Burgundy follow the Rhone into Provence, wind up on the Riviera Monte Carlo
ALEX: ( getting caught up in his own fantasy ) We'll drive down through Burgundy follow the Rhone into Provence, wind up on the Riviera Monte Carlo
GABRIELLA: Princess Stephanie. He gives a rueful laugh; she's younger than he easily They have tables at the casino where you play baccarat and the bets start at a hundred bucks.
ALEX: They have tables at the casino where you play baccarat and the bets start at a hundred bucks.
GABRIELLA: ( with a chuckle ) You won't be able to afford it. You'll have spent all your money on my clothes and my jewelry. ( slipping her leg
ALEX: ( CONTINUED ) 188 CONTINUED: ( 3 )
GABRIELLA: I'll wear something like that and then if you lose you can throw it on the table to cover your bet, like James Bond.
ALEX: James had an expense account. He rolls onto his back, she lays her cheek on his graying chest. He no longer wants to make love.
ALEX: What made you think of the necklace? She's drifting toward sleep.
GABRIELLA: I looked good in it, didn't I? He pats her shoulder without answering. He won't sleep for a while.
GABRIELLA: 194 INT. MARKETPLACE - DAY Jason'son a pay phone.
HELLO: 194 INT. MARKETPLACE - DAY Jason'son a pay phone.
JASON: ( into the phone ) Come meet me, I gotta talk to you. I'm at the Haitian marketplace. You know where it is?
JASON: An thing you want. Don't drive, take a cab ( as she laughs at what sounds like silliness ) I'll wait for you. Jason hangs up. He looks around. He doesn't see Victor watching from the trinket stand. Be walks to the counter where he has already ordered coffee and pie. He picks up his fork. He can't eat. There's a folded newspaper left behind by another customer. He pulls it over.
WAITRESS: Refill, hon?
HIS POV: Gabriella waves to him.
GABRIELLA: Okay. Here I am. What is it? Do you know how much a cab costs?
JASON: I saw a guy following me. I thought you weren't safe. I was going to tell you to go stay at your
COUSIN'S: She starts to swivel off the stool to leave. He grabs her I'm so sick of this. You'd say He hands her the newspaper.
JASON: ( HARDER )
GABRIELLA: I'm so sick of this. You'd say He hands her the newspaper.
GABRIELLA: Read it.
WHAT: Read it.
JASON: Read it.
GABRIELLA: reads the headline and starts to laugh.
GABRIELLA: There is such a thing as justicel Dina's necklace. Couldn't happen to a better person.
JASON: Alex stole it.
GABRIELLA: You really hate him.
JASON: The reason I know is because I stole it from him. Her eyes widen.
VICTOR: his face concealed among the candles is trying to figure out what drama is going on between Jason and Gabriella. He can read their faces, but not their lips.
GABRIELLA: . The sonofabitch. That's why he went out with me. He was trying to use me! ( the thought hits her ) They'll think I'm part of it! The maid who got fired??
JASON: You weren't a maid.
GABRIELLA: What difference does it make??
JASON: We're going to the Gulf.
JASON: accelerates. Gabriella nuzzles his neck.
JASON: looks back.
ALEX: A man with your breeding usually rings the doorbell.
VICTOR: There was, is, no time.
ALEX: ( SITTING UP )
VICTOR: I know you keep money here Your stash. Give it to me. Alex spreads out his hands.
AALEX: Vic, Vic The golf club catches him in the midsection. Alex cries out. The blow folds him forward onto his knees.
VICTOR: The. cops are about to drive up your He brings the club down on Alex's bare foot.
ALEX: ( through teeth clenched
VICTOR: Where is it? He clips Alex on the other leg as he tries to crawl away. The physical effort shortens Victor's breathing. His cough sprays blood. He tightens his grip on the club.
ALEX ": Believe me I swear to God, I
DON'T: Victor raises the club over Alex's head, and brings it down on the coffee table instead. The glass-explodes. He has to push the words out through aâ¢coughing spasm.
VICTOR: I refuse to die in a fucking prison Alex staggers to his feet. Victor is struggling for breath. Alex jerks the golf club away from him and tosses it on the floor.
ALEX: Come on, this is pitiful. Victor drops onto the sofa. He gags on the blood in his throat and desperately draws in air.
ALEX: What a mess. He picks up a sofa pillow to arrange it for him. Victor gives him a grateful smile. Alex presses the pillow down over his face before he can react. His feet flail. Alex has to lie on top of him to hold him down. A couple making out on the couch. The GUN THUMPS to the floor. Victor's movements slow, and stop. Alex takes no chances. He keeps the pillow jammed down until there's no possibility of trickery. Satisfied, he rolls Victor's dead body onto the floor, steps over it, and with steady hands he opens a bottle of very expensive wine. He pours a glass.
ALEX: ( QUIETLY )
GABRIELLA: ( into the phone ) I'm with him.
ALEX: What took you so long.
GABRIELLA: He has a boat, Alex! It's on the boat. The dumb shit wants to turn it over to the cops. You know what'll happen to me. Alex is taking his passport out of his desk.
ALEX: Just tell me how to find you.
GABRIELLA: presses her cheek against Jason's back.
JASON: ( CALLING OUT )
HENRY: Henry emerges from the cabin. He eyes Gabriella.
HENRY: Oh, my.
JASON: This is Gabriella. She's my She looks quickly at Jason, who smiles. Henry reaches out to shake her hand.
HENRY: Kid's a sucker for dark skin.
HIS POV: Alex's foot swinging. More of him comes INTO SIGHT as Jason climbs to deck. The financial pages open on his lap, he's drinking a Styrofoam cup of coffee and eating a donut; the rest of the bag of donuts is next to him.
ALEX: Good morning! I brought donuts. Jason is struck silent. He sits down on the side of the boat, his arms around his ribs.
ALEX: Oh, it's not as bad as all that.
JASON: She fucking called you.
ALEX: She has some residual loyalty, yeah.
ALEX: Where are we going?
JASON: I'm going fishing. Get off if you No, it's a beautiful day for a boat ride. Give us a chance to talk. He makes himself comfortable.
ALEX: No, it's a beautiful day for a boat ride. Give us a chance to talk. He makes himself comfortable.
JASON: Then make yourself useful and cast off the stern line. Alex moves to the stern while Jason casts off the bow This one?
ALEX: This one?
JASON: There's not a lot of choice. Alex casts off. Jason backs the-boat into position. He sees Henry asleep in the doorway of the marine supplies store next to the shuttered bar. Alex rejoins him.
ALEX: If we could manage to ignore the personal history here, I think we could work something out between us. Jason turns the boat toward the open sea.
ALEX: You want Gabriella? This is the way to have her. Life costs, Jason. Love costs. And you love her more than I do.
HIM ): So stake yourself to a life together. Give her what she needs
GABRIELLA: Why are we
JASON: Shut up! Just shut up! She sits on the bench, her face tight and angry.
ALEX: He's feeling like you let him down. .She gives Alex a look that silences him. He reaches for another donut. The SOUNDS of the ENGINE and the HULL hitting the waves substitute for conversation.
JASON: Okay. I'm ready to listen. He sits down beside a pole and looks over at Gabriella, who has put on a hat. She's staring out to sea.
JASON: ( TO GABRIELLA )
ALEX: We're giving you a hard choice, Gabby. Two rich men. Gabriella swivels her head slowly.
GABRIELLA: I don't want either one of you. A line quivers. Jason reels in a little.
JASON: Something's going to bite, just
ABOUT: ( his biceps tightening ) And the bait is taken at the moment he said. The line reels out very, very fast. He lets the fish run with it. Gabriella has turned around to watch. Now Jason reels in a little, making the line taut, testing the weight. He yanks back. The line rises from the ocean, bringing to the surface a big, dark green fish. _
ALEX: Jesus! What the hell is that?
JASON: Hammerhead. Young. Male. Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared.
GABRIELLA: Help him, Alex.
ALEX: I'd just get in his way. His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared without either of them noticing.
JASON: Is this your backup plan?
ALEX: You want it so bad, it's yours. He pulls out the necklace and hurls it away from Alex.
JASON: You want it so bad, it's yours. He pulls out the necklace and hurls it away from Alex.
ALEX: ( MOANING )
ALEX: scrambles toward the necklace.
GABRIELLA: Don't let him have it! He'll kill
USL: Jason grabs her-and holds her with both arms to keep her from going any closer. Alex turns his head, puzzled, warned. Too late. The shark suddenly thrashes, its jaws snapping around him. Gabriella screams with Alex. He FIRES his GUN over and over until it's empty. The shark continues to tear at him.
ALEX: Help me, help.mel! Gabriella runs down into the cabin. Much as he hates Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges. forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The shark slowly changes color to a dull brown.
ALEX: You knew it wasn't dead. Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries.
JASON: Mom didn't take the necklace. Alex struggles to stay conscious.
ALEX: Then you killed her yourself. Jason slowly nods.
JASON: And you were in the car behind us. Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying We were supposed to turn him ini I didn't think you were going to kill Well, I didn't. Alex manages to laugh.
GABRIELLA: We were supposed to turn him ini I didn't think you were going to kill Well, I didn't. Alex manages to laugh.
JASON: Well, I didn't. Alex manages to laugh.
ALEX: Jesus. You set me up. You had her call me.
JASON: I'll get on the radio. Gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around what's left of Alex to bandage. She smears away the tears so she can see and leaves blood tracked across her face. She looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace. They look at each other.
JASON: has the microphone in his hand. He's setting course. Gabriella appears behind him. She's holding the flare gun. She puts it back where she found it, and steps beside him and puts her arm around his waist. He lays his arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses the radio.
JASON: This is Hercules II, calling the 218 EXT. BOAT - DAY
CLOSER ANGLE: You cool?
HENRY: You cool?
JASON: I will be.
HENRY: See ya. He and Jason wave goodbye. The boat moves out. Henry is left with Alex.
ALEX: ( weakly; to Henry ) What's your name?
HENRY: No way
ALEX: ( still the salesman ) No, listen, listen this is worth a fortune. ( thrusting the necklace
HENRY: Yeah. Good advice. And he walks away fast.
ALEX: Wait, don't go! Come back here. Come on back! Henry's gone. Alex rolls onto his belly and starts dragging himself down the dock, too much of an optimist to give up hope in a hopeless situation.
