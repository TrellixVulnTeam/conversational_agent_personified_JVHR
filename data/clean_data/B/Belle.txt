BELLE: Written by Misan Sagay
LADY MARY: Elizabeth Murray, bring yourself back here this very moment!
LORD MANSFIELD: What in God's name have you done!!
LADY MANSFIELD: She.she is black.
LADY MARY: But she IS black!
LORD MANSFIELD: A detail you chose NOT to share.
LORD MANSFIELD: ( fury ) Captain Sir John Lindsay, do you find me a fool? She is a MULATTO!
LORD MANSFIELD: You keep in mind my position..? My reputation.?
LORD MANSFIELD: Then have some sense of propriety boy.and understand what you are
LORD MANSFIELD: How do we raise her.?
LADY MANSFIELD: That is simply impossible.
LADY MANSFIELD: What has she been named?
LORD MANSFIELD: She takes your name?
LADY MARY: We cannot have another Elizabeth in the household.
LADY MANSFIELD: We.we will call her Dido. Good Lord, she is thin. Mary, find her something to eat.
ELIZABETH: Are you.a nee-gro?
LADY MARY: Questions, questions, Elizabeth! Tis a most irritating trait you and your father share.
ELIZABETH: Papaa M?
LADY MARY: No your blood papaa. Sir David Murray. You should not insist on always speaking your mind, you know. You will end up an old maid with only your own company for Like you, Aunt Mary? That is what the maids say?
ELIZABETH: Like you, Aunt Mary? That is what the maids say?
LADY MARY: You little..
LORD MANSFIELD: Captain Sir John Lindsay. Do you recognise him?
LORD MANSFIELD: D'you see here.? This..this is your grandfather, Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick.
DIDO: Elizabeth's papa.
LORD MANSFIELD: You are a sharp little one. He is The Seventh Viscount Stormont. .to inherit everything that we are standing on when I am gone.
LADY MANSFIELD: Born on English soil?
LORD MANSFIELD: aboard a captured Spanish slave ship. He was charged with conveying it back to these shores, he tells me.
LADY MANSFIELD: for the woman.
LORD MANSFIELD: ( dry ) And there I was believing it was sheer lack of `self control'. ( scathing ) He has been at sea, six years. All of this child's life!
LADY MANSFIELD: wellbeing. The child is not altogether uncivilized. So.now we have two nieces in our guardianship.
LORD MANSFIELD: ( reticent ) Elizabeth was much in need of a when questions are asked of us?
LADY MANSFIELD: when questions are asked of us?
LORD MANSFIELD: with her birthright, she is entitled to live beneath this roof. Such.is the nature of `order'.
LADY MANSFIELD: her colour be placed? Below or above her Murray bloodline? May she dine with us?
LORD MANSFIELD: company. We cannot escape society's confines on etiquette
LADY MANSFIELD: He shakes his head at the complexity of it all.
LORD MANSFIELD: Impossible. Any match her..'other origins' may attract would surely disgrace her and the family rank.
LADY MANSFIELD: And when we are no longer here? No husband - who will take care of her?
DIDO: Bette! No.no surprises Bette!
LADY MARY: ( shrieking ) Girls! Will you refrain from shrieking like the.bless-ed
REVEREND DAVINIER: .for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. So saith Christ the Lord. Amen.
CONGREGATION: A FLAME as a YOUNG MAN lights a candle by the altar. He sings, choir-like, the word `amen' rather than simply saying it.
REVEREND DAVINIER: Hymn no. 76.
LORD MANSFIELD: I have reason to speak with you alone, Dido.
DIDO: Have I wronged you, Papaa?
LORD MANSFIELD: You have done no such thing.
LORD MANSFIELD: I have not past experience in the ways of breaking grave news to you.
DIDO: ( quiet, shock ) I thought I should one day have the opportunity to make his better acquaintance.
LORD MANSFIELD: Yes. I know.
ELIZABETH: Two thousand pounds a year?
ELIZABETH: He must have loved you, Dido.
DIDO: He did not know me.
ELIZABETH: My father's new wife wishes him to leave me not a thing, and he obliges her.
DIDO: Then it is her cruelty you should lament, Bette, not his stupidity.
ELIZABETH: I think he might have loved me more if Mamaa had not died.
DIDO: ( pained ) I.I think love must be a very complicated thing.
ELIZABETH: Dido - with such a dowry you may marry into any good family you wish.
LADY MARY: We shall receive visitors for dinner.
ELIZABETH: Visitors? Who ever bothers to visit us here?
DIDO: Or leave. except the dead!
LADY MARY: Once again, Dido?
DIDO: Beds.Aunt Mary. We should prepare some extra beds. in case our visitors are to stay.
ELIZABETH: May we wear the new silks?
DIDO: I will do your hair, Bette. Oh say we may wear them, Aunt Mary.
LADY MARY: You will not be dining with us, Dido.
DIDO: ( hurt ) Yes of course. But I may join after dinner, may I not?
LADY MARY: Yes. Such are the rules, and you know them well.
DIDO: She is a most disagreeable. hideous, old maid - I hate her!
LORD MANSFIELD: You do not! She is only managing the dictates of the household
DIDO: Papaa.how.how may I be too high in rank to dine with the servants and too low to dine with my family?
LORD MANSFIELD: Dinner with guests is a formal proceeding, Dido - we simply cannot impose the disregard of those formalities upon visitors.
DIDO: But.Papaa, am I not..'wealthy', now.an heiress? Surely that changes matters.
LORD MANSFIELD: ( softly ) My dear.I wish it were so simple. Finances may go some way - but Society has a habit of disregarding even one of their own, when opportunity provides.
DIDO: ( stung ) Of course.( trailing off )
LORD MANSFIELD: BUT after dinner.when formality is of less consequence.well your presence can raise no defendable objections.
DIDO: As you wish, sir.
LADY MANSFIELD: ELIZABETH emerges from the house, breathless.
ELIZABETH: There you are. I have been searching for you!
LADY MANSFIELD: ( to Dido ) What a wretched countenance!
LADY MARY: She deplores my authority. What am I in this household, if not the `observer of rules'?!
ELIZABETH: I would rather dine with Dido!
LADY MANSFIELD: What a great pity
LADY MARY: LADY MANSFIELD
LADY MANSFIELD: Our young gentlemen guests shall miss you, Elizabeth.
LADY MARY: Very good connections.
LADY MANSFIELD: And most agreeable by all accounts!
LADY MARY: Close your mouth and understand: There shall be no discussions tonight in any languages other than English! No whisperings in gentlemen's ears - not in Latin, Italian.and certainly not French!
JAMES ASHFORD: What excellent French! Though I have not an idea of what you said.
ELIZABETH: I said.`Your hands have the suggestion of a sensitive man'.
LADY ASHFORD: I must say, the entire country barely breathes awaiting your judgement on this appeal. Terrified you shall destroy England, no doubt. I know Lord A is. He does wonder though, what can be taking you.so long?
LORD MANSFIELD: ( mild condescension ) The law, Lady Ashford. It is to be interpreted - not merely administered.
LADY MARY: My brother is not a man of rash instinct.
LADY MANSFIELD: For that we are all grateful.
LADY ASHFORD: What a lot of fuss over dead cargo.
LORD MANSFIELD: It is a fuss over the bread and butter of a great many in these isles. A great many, Lady Ashford.
DIDO: Miss Lindsay?
WIMBRIDGE: Miss Lindsay?
DIDO: There are poachers wandering.!
JOHN: Good evening to you. I am John Davinier, I..I believe I may have disturbed a lady of this house.
DIDO: Sir, I do not believe we have been introduced!
JOHN: Indeed. I.I. Please inform the lady of my apologies for startling her. I took advantage of the back fields, by way of a short-cut to deliver this to Lord Mansfield. from my father.
WIMBRIDGE: He hands WIMBRIDGE an envelope.
JOHN: Reverend Davinier.
WIMBRIDGE: Of course, sir. I will see that he gets it immediately.
DIDO: You shall not interrupt him at dinner, Wimbridge!
WIMBRIDGE: Immediately - after dinner, sir.
JOHN: Yes, of course.thank you.
WIMBRIDGE: Good night, sir.
LORD MANSFIELD: Dido.my dear.
LADY ASHFORD: ( whispers to her sons ) Good Lord - the negro! She really is.
JAMES ASHFORD: ( quietly disturbed ) .a lady.
OLIVER: LADY ASHFORD
LADY ASHFORD: I hadn't expected her to look Mamaa, did you not listen to the rumours when you were spreading
OLIVER: Mamaa, did you not listen to the rumours when you were spreading
LORD MANSFIELD: May I present to you the second of my nieces - Miss Dido Lindsay.
OLIVER: A pleasure, Miss Lindsay.
ELIZABETH: ( sotto - re. James ) He is the eldest - to inherit the entire Ashford fortune. He is also to inherit from his uncle - a healthy man, who shows little sign of departure.
DIDO: How do you know?
ELIZABETH: Lady Ashford herself. She seems rather despondent at her brother's robust constitution.
DIDO: He has much to recommend him. And a second fortune in life should please any wife.
ELIZABETH: Dido! You are not to be a coquette with him! You already have your fortune!
DIDO: Are you suggesting I now condescend to a gentleman without means, Bette?! What should good society think of us!
OLIVER: She is intriguing, is she not?
JAMES: I find her repulsive.
OLIVER: I suppose she is.if you find a most rare and exotic flower so. She is quite something to behold.
ELIZABETH: ( flustered, to DIDO ) Good Lord! They are appraising me!
JAMES: One does not make a wife of the rare and exotic, Oliver. One samples it on the cotton fields of the Indies.
OLIVER: So far, when it is right at my door?
JAMES: .Then finds a pure ENGLISH rose to decorate one's home.
LADY ASHFORD: Is she `OUT'??
LADY MANSFIELD: ( embarrassed ) Not quite.
LADY MARY: ( awkward ) Any day now.
LADY ASHFORD: You will refrain from any intercourse with the negress. Lord and Lady Mansfield may find it fascinating to have a Lady Mulatto running around their household, but I will not have one running around mine!
OLIVER: She is an heiress.
LADY ASHFORD: Although exceptions can be made.
OLIVER: It is said that her father left her a rather vast fortune.
LADY ASHFORD: I mean to say, if that is your She is rather soft on the eye - I have thought no further Mamaa.
OLIVER: She is rather soft on the eye - I have thought no further Mamaa.
LADY ASHFORD: From where did you receive your Her sister-cousin has a rather fast tongue.
OLIVER: Her sister-cousin has a rather fast tongue.
DIDO: ( deferring to her father )
OLIVER: Oh do not be selfish with your good fortune, m'lord!
LADY ASHFORD: This will be most interesting!
LADY MARY: She has never played in company!
LADY ASHFORD: ( conceding ) She is.most accomplished.
LADY MANSFIELD: ( with deep satisfaction ) Hers was a most diligent governess.
LADY MANSFIELD: The liberty of asking her to play! And when he can have no better intentions towards her.
LORD MANSFIELD: She must not delude herself. Such decisions are not hers to make.
LADY MANSFIELD: Then spell it out to her! Before she renders herself.sport to some `gent' of cruel promises!!!
LORD MANSFIELD: She has no reason. Hers is an inheritance that renders her free of the usual inducements to marry.
LADY MANSFIELD: Well, that, at least, is true, Indeed, it is Elizabeth who needs to secure her bread and butter.
ELIZABETH: A portrait? Are you sure?
DIDO: Yes.Aunt Mary has confirmed it.
ELIZABETH: Good Lord. How.truly wonderful.
DIDO: ( becoming exasperated ) But what, Dido?
ELIZABETH: ( becoming exasperated ) But what, Dido?
DIDO: Papaa.should he not have wished to SEE me before deciding?
LORD MANSFIELD: ( dry ) Mr Davinier, I believe you have already had the pleasure.
JOHN: ( ironic ) In.some way - yes. ( to DIDO ) Miss Lindsay.
LORD MANSFIELD: Decide what?
DIDO: If he should.should WANT to paint me!
LORD MANSFIELD: The man is to be paid a fortune. What is there to decide?
DIDO: LORD MANSFIELD
LORD MANSFIELD: Dido, you are to simply sit still. Not a challenging task!
DIDO: ( anxious ) Next.next to Elizabeth.?
LORD MANSFIELD: As you always are - right beside one another.
JOHN: Should.should not any lady be flattered to be such a subject?
DIDO: How should any male know the ways of a lady when he has not even mastered the ways of a gentleman?
JOHN: Quite! Though one should be forgiven for thinking he was in the presence of a lady - when she is, in fact, still a juvenile!
DIDO: Papaa, may we do this in private!
LORD MANSFIELD: Not now, no! You may return the books to the library.
DIDO: LORD MANSFIELD casts her a stare and she is silenced. DIDO begins collecting giant hardbacks, exasperated.
LORD MANSFIELD: Upon her husband's death a widow may receive..
JOHN: .her marriage portion and inheritance at once. She has forty days to leave her husband's home.
LORD MANSFIELD: ( contemplation ) Yours are grand ambitions.
JOHN: To. to provide certainty where there might otherwise be none.
LORD MANSFIELD: The Zong ship and those drowned.
JOHN: The Zong ship and those drowned.
LORD MANSFIELD: It is one of the few trades acceptable to a gentleman.
JOHN: I am no member of the nobility - I have little, but.where my father relies on the bible, I.I wish to rely on the law courts.
LORD MANSFIELD: You aspire to the judiciary?
JOHN: One day.yes.m'lord. I wish to make the laws not only administer them - for that.that is how I may truly change this world. I mean to say, make it. a better place.
LORD MANSFIELD: Noble if not pompous! A country lawyer, you may make - perhaps! If you pay every regard to what you are taught - but you have neither the rank nor finances for any more!
JOHN: ( tentative ) If I may, m'lord - neither did you!
LORD MANSFIELD: I beg your pardon?
JOHN: Well.as a fourth son, you had rank but not the income to pay for your qualification to the Inns.
LORD MANSFIELD: You believe you are worthy of such considerations? Such are your capabilities?
JOHN: That I do not know, M'lord. I have not yet been afforded those considerations.but I know a country life does not suit me.
LORD MANSFIELD: The Reverend has requested I take his son into my tutorage, Dido. What do you think?
JOHN: Thank you for your gracious
DIDO: I neither spoke for or against you - since neither is my place.
JOHN: Silence speaks volumes.
ELIZABETH: Papaa's new student.
JOHN: Mr Davinier, my cousin, Elizabeth.
DIDO: Mr Davinier, my cousin, Elizabeth.
JOHN: A pleasure.
DIDO: ( to John ) Papaa has never taken a pupil, you realise?
ELIZABETH: Someone to keep you company while you take Papaa's dictation, Dido. Truth is, there have been more of your sex at Kenwood this week, than I've previously seen in all my entire life!
JOHN: Hopefully we have not disappointed!
ELIZABETH: On the contrary!
DIDO: Mr Davinier, what.what is the importance of the Zong. why is the case before Papaa's court, the supreme court.?
JOHN: ( he struggles, tentative ) It is a cargo ship.
DIDO: I.I am aware of that.
JOHN: A human-cargo ship.
DIDO: Oh. You said those who were It lost most of its slaves before arriving at its destination. Drowned - by the crew on the captain's order.
JOHN: It lost most of its slaves before arriving at its destination. Drowned - by the crew on the captain's order.
DIDO: The SOUND of the MANSFIELDS gathering with the ASHFORDS. A maid approaches hurrying about her duties.
MAID: Miss, your supper is served now in the ladies' parlour.
DIDO: Thank you.
LADY MANSFIELD: Mr Davinier, will you be joining us for dinner?
JOHN: I..er.I thank you, Madam, but I am promised to the company of my aunt this evening. She has recently moved to the cottage at Belsize.
LADY MANSFIELD: Of course - as you wish.
JOHN: Permit me to ask, why you do not dine with your family - ever?
DIDO: That is not correct.
JOHN: Forgive me.but twice now I have seen.I have seen you separated from the gathering.
DIDO: And well you might be - when the son of clergy is permitted to the table before a lady of the house.
JOHN: Is that a reminder of my place, Miss Lindsay?
DIDO: No. It's a statement of mine!
JOHN: ( he pats his animal ) There is much speculation on your decision. Anticipation seems to be turning to panic, m'lord.
LORD MANSFIELD: I cannot disagree.
JOHN: One hundred and thirty two drowned on route from Africa to the West Indies. Your ruling could bring the slave trade to its knees - entirely destroy an economic foundation of these lands. Is that pressure not maddening,
LORD MANSFIELD: Justitia fiat, ruat coelum, Mr Davinier - Let justice be done, though the heavens may fall.
JOHN: The insurance claim states, the slaves were thrown overboard for the safety of the ship - that there wasn't sufficient water for the cargo and crew to survive the rest of the voyage.
LORD MANSFIELD: It does.
JOHN: Then, if I am correct, the case hangs on.
LORD MANSFIELD: .IT HANGS on `Absolute necessity'. If the cargo was
JOHN: LORD MANSFIELD adjusts his language.
LORD MANSFIELD: If the killing of the..'negros' was truly `necessary' in order to save the ship - as the captain contends.
JOHN: But.is that where it hinges?
LORD MANSFIELD: The ship's journey was thwarted by impossible weather conditions - what should have been weeks became months! What once appeared enough water, may not have been!
JOHN: I am sensible of this, m'lord.
LORD MANSFIELD: Then do you know what a hundred thirsty slaves are capable of? I can tell you no man happily disposes of his cargo, even in the face of rebellion! So now tell me - were you to dock at port with barely a piece of merchandise left to trade - what would you do? Swallow financial ruin - or claim your due from the insurers.
JOHN: With due respect. I should question, whether 'human' life should have been insurable as cargo - at all.
LADY MARY: A gentleman rather like him once paid me much interest.
ELIZABETH: Mr Davinier?
LADY MANSFIELD: ( matter of fact. ) Really, Mary?
LADY MARY: Do not look at me like that! It was my Mamaa who intervened. I thought he had a very great sense of duty. Overly kind at times but.
DIDO: ( gently ) But.what, Aunt Mary?
LADY MANSFIELD: HE is engaged, you know?
LADY MARY: Is he?
ELIZABETH: Is he?
LADY MANSFIELD: Mr Beresford's daughter.
ELIZABETH: The carriage-maker! He might have set his sights a little higher!
ZOFFANY: To the window, Miss Lindsay
DIDO: She is upon him in the CORRIDOR! They stand silent, awkward.
JOHN: I.I was curious.
DIDO: Quite a task - to sit for so many hours.( beat ). Congratulations! I learned of your..your match..yesterday.
JOHN: Thank you.
DIDO: I appear the only one to have just learned of this affair?
JOHN: Perhaps yours is a life less concerned with such matters.
DIDO: Why do you judge me so?
JOHN: Are you at utter disconnect from
DIDO: Mr Davinier.please. Tell me. Tell me what you know!
JOHN: I can only tell you what I believe.
DIDO: ( trying to understand ) And what.what is that?
JOHN: The slaves were intentionally drowned, that is not in question. Chained! Thrown into the waters - chained together as one.
DIDO: But the insurers are appealing.
JOHN: Yes. They are challenging the decision of the lower court - refusing to pay for murdered
DIDO: Thank you.
DIDO: ( whispers )
ELIZABETH: There you are!
LADY MANSFIELD: We are to attend London for the
DIDO: We are to finally `come out'??
LORD MANSFIELD: ( clarifying ) Elizabeth is to come out.
LADY MANSFIELD: Dido is not.
DIDO: But why?
LORD MANSFIELD: You understand the ways of this world for a female, Dido. Elizabeth has no income. When all this is gone to her father, I have nothing to leave her.
LADY MANSFIELD: You are to meet as many gentlemen as possible, before we make the match.
ELIZABETH: 43 INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 7 43
DIDO: And me?
LORD MANSFIELD: Dido, you are well taken care of - Of this, you are well aware.
LADY MANSFIELD: A gentleman of good breeding is unlikely to form any serious attachment to Dido, and a man without, will lower her position in society.
ELIZABETH: But she is not merely my cousin, Mamaa, she is my sister. I cannot attend London without her!
LORD MANSFIELD: You may attend London together to keep Elizabeth company and save the pain of a few weeks separation.
LADY MANSFIELD: Lord knows I will need you both to keep each other out of trouble.
DIDO: LORD MANSFIELD
LORD MANSFIELD: You are not to be denied, Dido.
DIDO: Papaa, please!
LORD MANSFIELD: These are the keys to the house. They have hung at the waist of your aunt for the last thirty years.
DIDO: ( horrified ) No! I am not Lady Mary. I am not an unwanted maid!
LORD MANSFIELD: Lady Mary is too old to continue in charge of the house.
DIDO: Are.are you punishing me?
LORD MANSFIELD: Punishing you!! Dido, you are most cherished. Most loved. Why .why would you say such a thing?
DIDO: She tries to find courage to speak. LORD MANSFIELD waits.
LORD MANSFIELD: Because what?
ELIZABETH: I am sorry, Dido. So very sorry.
LORD MANSFIELD: You told her they were wantonly Because they were! Those slaves were diseased - some were already dying - yes. But it was essential they die ON the journey or they would not come under insurance consideration! Neither too, if they had expired of their diseases - That is why they were killed - this we all know!
JOHN: Because they were! Those slaves were diseased - some were already dying - yes. But it was essential they die ON the journey or they would not come under insurance consideration! Neither too, if they had expired of their diseases - That is why they were killed - this we all know!
LORD MANSFIELD: You have entered my home and utterly taken advantage of the confidential matters afforded you.
JOHN: These `matters' have been for public consumption for months. Miss Lindsay is no child.no.. Her precious care is in my hands and I will decide when she is ready for such realities. Not the son of a vicar! A vicar who, incidently purchased his living from me!
LORD MANSFIELD: ( incandescent ) Her precious care is in my hands and I will decide when she is ready for such realities. Not the son of a vicar! A vicar who, incidently purchased his living from me!
JOHN: I shall gather my belongings.
LORD MANSFIELD: Do so!
JOHN: Your Lordship, a question?
LORD MANSFIELD: WHAT, Mr Davinier!
JOHN: As the mere son of a vicar - I wonder whether the value you extend to your very precious mulatto niece - well I wonder if it amounts to MORE.or LESS than the thirty pounds insurance the traders are asking for each life they murdered?
LORD MANSFIELD: Mr Davinier.
ELIZABETH: John Davinier is leaving very early today!
ELIZABETH: I could fall in love with such a man, Dido.
LADY MARY: The two girls are startled. LADY MARY smiles to herself.
DIDO: ( whispers ) Bette, you could feel no such sentiment for you should either end poor or. broken hearted.
DIDO: That you shan't be at the caprice of some silly Sir and his fortune! The rest of us haven't the choice! Not a chance of inheritance if we have brothers and forbidden from any activity that allows us to support ourselves.
ELIZABETH: That you shan't be at the caprice of some silly Sir and his fortune! The rest of us haven't the choice! Not a chance of inheritance if we have brothers and forbidden from any activity that allows us to support ourselves.
LADY MANSFIELD: Light the fires for dinner, will you, Thomas.
DIDO: You are so beautiful, Bette. I hope your match is the most wonderful of all gentlemen.
MABEL: Some bed socks for you, Miss Murray, Miss Lindsay. It's not as warm as we hoped tonight
ELIZABETH,: Thank you Mabel.How kind.
MABEL: Can I help you with that, Miss
DIDO: Mabel, I am fine - thank you!
MABEL: You must start from the ends, miss.
LADY MANSFIELD: Promise me you will change that vulgar teal paint, if you ever become lady of this home. It is positively wanting, Elizabeth.
MAID: Lady Mansfield, LADY MARY and their nieces, Madam.
LADY ASHFORD: LADY MANSFIELD
LADY MANSFIELD: Lady Ashford.
LADY ASHFORD: ( reassuring ) Here, of course. Very little could have prevented him, knowing that Miss Murray would visit today.
LORD ASHFORD: Lord Mansfield's infamous Mulatto. No wonder our `Lord Chief Justice knows not whether he is coming or going! Not your usual game, Oliver.
LADY ASHFORD: Grenadine syrup.
LADY MARY: And port!!
LADY MANSFIELD: Which has gone to my head already!
ELIZABETH: Oh Dido look - Mr James has made me a boat and it has capsized.
DIDO: What a dreadful shame.
OLIVER: ( to DIDO, earnest ) For you.
DIDO: Thank you.
OLIVER: Miss Lindsay, would you do me the honour of taking some air with me, some time?
JAMES: Don't you care what people will say
ELIZABETH: What is that to mean Mr James? What should anyone say?!
JAMES: That he should compromise a lady's reputation by stepping out with her - scarcely having made her acquaintance!
OLIVER: I think you are a great deal too anxious, brother. We should merely take a turn around Vauxhall.
DIDO: I should be delighted, Mr Oliver! Most delighted.
ELIZABETH: Are you really to defy Papaa?
LADY MANSFIELD: ( re. Dido with Oliver ) I am not at ease with this. Lord Mansfield would be most Oh it can do no harm. This is simply two families, enjoying a day together.
LADY ASHFORD: Oh it can do no harm. This is simply two families, enjoying a day together.
OLIVER: Well I did not think I would ever find a lady who was not to be conquered or ignored.Until you.
DIDO: Ah now how do I know this is not just another tactic in your battle to conquer?
OLIVER: See how my heart beats.
DIDO: Despite.such pronounced protestations from your brother?
OLIVER: He cannot overlook your mother's origins, as I do. Foolish. Why should anyone even pay her regard when your better half has equipped you so well with loveliness and
DIDO: What a lovely sound.
OLIVER: You are unrelentingly cultured. Come, let's find it!
LADY MANSFIELD: People will think she has no family!
LADY MARY: Let her enjoy his society.
OLIVER: I might only have dreamed of these moments, at one time.
DIDO: Really? You are much of the conqueror Mr Oliver.
JOHN: Miss Lindsay.
DIDO: ( flushed ) Mr Davinier. How.how nice to see you.
JOHN: And you, Miss Lindsay.
DIDO: Forgive me - Mr Ashford, may I present to you.Mr Davinier.
OLIVER: A clergyman! Good day, to you.sir.
JOHN: Sir. ( beat ) My regards to your family, Miss Lindsay.
DIDO: Elizabeth and Mamaa are here. in fact.
JOHN: ( dismayed ) Miss Lindsay, you are alone!!
DIDO: I did not have the chance to see you before you left.Mr Davinier .to convey my apologies.
JOHN: Your pupilage. Father would never have ended it.you.you never would have had to leave Kenwood were it not.
DIDO: Your pupilage. Father would never have ended it.you.you never would have had to leave Kenwood were it not.
JOHN: He would make mine a living hell, were he to know of us speaking.
DIDO: What are you doing here in London Mr Davinier?
JOHN: I am under a third cousin - a solicitor, here. Nothing more than petty disputes between unsavoury landlords and debauched tenants, but I cannot discount it.
DIDO: Not what you wished for.
JOHN: I haven't given up on The Inns. Nothing worth having in life comes easily.
DIDO: ( flushed ) Where are my manners? I trust the future Mrs Davinier is well.
JOHN: Very well.thank you.
DIDO: I have tried to keep up - with the Zong. These past weeks.
JOHN: ( agitated ) Tis pitiful! Such inability to simply know what value to put on another's life.
DIDO: ( bitterly ) What price, a worthless Negro.
JOHN: ( frustrated ) You utterly misunderstand me. I am saying that no man may have the value of that of cargo!!! Human beings cannot be priced, since we are priceless!! Freemen and slaves alike!
DIDO: But that would require a change of law. I know nothing but.
JOHN: A change in law - something the insurance companies can lobby for IF they can be persuaded to band We may only be students, but.change is most always precipitated by the young. Someone has to have the courage. How can we expect to be civilised if we live in a barbaric world.
DIDO: No. It is more than that. It's the shame of a law that would uphold a financial transaction upon that atrocity.
JOHN: That is indeed the truth.
DIDO: I have never heard anyone speak like you.
JOHN: Nor I, you, Miss Lindsay.
DIDO: No we cannot risk it.
JOHN: Good bye, Miss Lindsay. I suspect, we will never see each other again.
DIDO: Good bye, Mr Davinier.
JOHN: Miss Lindsay?!! We.commune at the Coaching Inn - Kentish Town.most
DIDO: A beat as they regard each other - then she moves off.
OLIVER: I did not dare return to Lady Mansfield without you.
DIDO: ( relieved ) I..I am terribly sorry. I thought I saw the others, I went after them..and found myself lost.
LADY MANSFIELD: It's almost dark!
LADY ASHFORD: Look, here are James and Miss Murray.
ELIZABETH: I do hope you know how well I think of you.
JAMES: As I do you.
ELIZABETH: Then I hope, Sir, you plan to honour your attentions.as not to would leave me looking. quite foolish.
JAMES: And I should not call myself a
LADY ASHFORD: Say nothing! This has all been for the good of the future, I assure you!
LADY MANSFIELD: She is.
LADY ASHFORD: She will need a gentleman who can temper her. Quite a task.
LADY MANSFIELD: ( to Lady Ashford ) Do I sense that an address is finally to be made?
LADY ASHFORD: She is an exquisite girl. And.since there is no male heir and.it will therefore fall upon Elizabeth and her husband to eventually inherit all of Kenwood and its lands.
LADY MANSFIELD: Lady Ashford, may I.
LADY ASHFORD: .I realise there will be no end of worthy addresses to consider.
JAMES: LADY ASHFORD ( disgusted )
LADY ASHFORD: ( disgusted ) Without an inch of property, or shilling to her name!
OLIVER: ( sardonic ) Do you hear that, James? A lady's good breeding alone will not do!
LADY ASHFORD: ( to Oliver ) Your brother needs a wife who will bring him further land! LOTS!. if he is ever to exert more political influence than your father has.
JAMES: But what of her own father?
LADY ASHFORD: The Seventh Viscount Stormont is a scoundrel. Ensconced in Vienna with the girl's vicious step-mamaa and his new offspring - who I am told is to inherit EVERYTHING.
JAMES: She has the colouring of a farmer.
LADY ASHFORD: James, we do not talk about that, any longer.
JAMES: Is this really the very best you aspire to, Oliver? To introduce some woman of obscure birth into the family lineage?
LADY ASHFORD: James - you are my first boy - blessed by law to inherit your father's wealth. Be sympathetic to your brother. Like the unfortunate Miss Murray - a good family name and empty pockets will only get him so far!!
LADY MANSFIELD: Good heavens, Lord Mansfield has arrived a day early!
LADY MARY: ( calls out ) Mabel! Freshen the flowers!
DIDO: ( facetious ) Is Mabel a slave?
LORD MANSFIELD: I beg your pardon?
DIDO: LORD MANSFIELD swallows hard, his jaw tightens.
LORD MANSFIELD: She is free and under our protection.
DIDO: ( twice as facetious ) O! Like me!
ELIZABETH: Hardly, Dido!
LORD MANSFIELD: And paid a very respectable wage.
DIDO: How is the fraud appeal Papaa?
LORD MANSFIELD: The marine insurance. It is a Fraud case, is it not?
DIDO: The marine insurance. It is a Fraud case, is it not?
LORD MANSFIELD: That would depend on to whom you may speak.
DIDO: To cull your `cargo'? To do it solely to claim insurance because it was too diseased to achieve a good price at market? If not fraud, then what?
LORD MANSFIELD: Do you speak on my behalf, Dido?
LADY MANSFIELD: Oh will you please stop!
LADY MARY: I learned yesterday that Mr Davinier is in town.
LORD MANSFIELD: Makes sense. Dido is beginning to sound very much like him.
DIDO: Excuse me.
LORD ASHFORD: I had the pleasure of laying eyes on your adopted girl.
LORD MANSFIELD: ( facetious ) Which one?
LORD ASHFORD: You have raised a lovely young lady.And, though I understand she is kept under interesting rules, She raises questions.
LORD MANSFIELD: Spit it out.
LORD ASHFORD: Her introduction to society comes at a key time in the insurance appeal. Parliament is nervous that your `family situation' will colour your judgement.
LORD MANSFIELD: I will neither be pressured from the inside - or the outside.
LORD ASHFORD: ( calm ) You are the highest judge in the In you, they see a man who is of the persuasion and position to bring down the major trade of our time and the commercial health of this country. Some will say, next to our king, you are the most powerful man in England. And the same will ask how you, our Chief Justice can be fair?
LORD MANSFIELD: How? RULES are in place to dictate how we live - were that not the case, I would not have had the mandate to give shelter to my nephew's child.
LORD ASHFORD: ( softly ) I believe you.
LORD MANSFIELD: LORD ASHFORD ( tentative )
LORD ASHFORD: ( tentative ) I have a wish to seal the bond between the Ashford and Mansfield names. It would, however, require some relaxing of your most stringent rules, I must add!
LORD MANSFIELD: Is that so?
LORD MANSFIELD: I have had reason to speak with Lord Ashford.
LADY MANSFIELD: And I to Lady Ashford. Are we in agreement?
LORD MANSFIELD: We are. You once asked me, who would look after her when we are gone. Money is no substitute for a man's protection. I cannot deny her a match so suitable.
ELIZABETH: Whatever did happen in the end, Aunt Mary? With your gentleman
LADY MARY: He never married. Cousin Marjorie wrote me last year, that he had died after a long illness.
ELIZABETH: Oh Aunt Mary.
MABEL: Pardon me. Mr Ashford is here for you, miss.
MABEL: O excuse me! Mr Oliver, for you, Miss Lindsay.
LADY MANSFIELD: You need worry about nothing. Your Papaa has been dealt with.
OLIVER: Hello, Miss Lindsay.
DIDO: Mr Oliver.
OLIVER: I do hope my reason for being here will bring you as much happiness as it brings me.
DIDO: ( anxious ) Yes. Indeed it is.
OLIVER: So I feel my career is now set. All that remains.
LADY MARY: I cannot see.!
LADY MANSFIELD: On the stairs, ELIZABETH slows, as she approaches.
ELIZABETH: What are you doing?
LADY MANSFIELD: Quiet, Elizabeth!
DIDO: Good Lord, Mr Oliver! Your .your wife? Mrs Ashford?!
LADY MANSFIELD: ( overjoyed ) She has agreed! O.
ELIZABETH: LADY MANSFIELD throws open the doors, elated.
LADY MANSFIELD: OLIVER stands, his chest bursting with pride. DIDO shell- shocked, holds up her ring finger - the sapphire flashes.
O.!: OLIVER stands, his chest bursting with pride. DIDO shell- shocked, holds up her ring finger - the sapphire flashes.
DIDO: Mamaa, we are engaged!
LADY MANSFIELD: ( whispers, poignant ) You are my heart - from the moment I saw you. I only want you to be happy.
ELIZABETH: Dido.was there any message for me?
DIDO: No, Bette ( beat ) But..I am sure it won't be long.
ELIZABETH: What does it feel like Dido? To be engaged?
DIDO: ( unsure ) Perfect, Bette - pefect.
DIDO: He looks up. DIDO is sincere.
LADY MANSFIELD: We are to make many calls today, Elizabeth. Acquainting oneself with the most eligible gentleman is not light business.
ELIZABETH: Should we not wait a day or two - for Mr James?
LADY MARY: Elizabeth - some advice. Wait for no man, dear!
LADY MANSFIELD: Will you join us, Dido?
DIDO: I..I am terribly light headed this morning, Mamaa. I should like to take rest if it would not displease you.
LADY MANSFIELD: Oh dear! Unwell? And just as we are to announce your news!
DIDO: Harry! Harry!
HARRY: Alone, Miss?
DIDO: I shall not be alone, I shall be with you. Please - Harry. If you don't take me, I shall be forced to go alone.
HARRY: Mr Davinier?
JOHN: 78 EXT. COACHING INN/INT.MANSFIELD CARRIAGE. DAY.15 78
JOHN: Miss Lindsay!
DIDO: Mr Davinier.
JOHN: I didn't expect.! Are you to come inside?.Are.?
DIDO: No.It would be dangerous.
JOHN: ( feeling foolish ) Yes. Indeed.
DIDO: Oh Mr Davinier.I am so proud of you. I am so proud of what you are doing and.achieving.
JOHN: No. We've achieved little..
DIDO: At least thirty per cent of insurers are with you! It is a start. It is a real start.
JOHN: What are they?
DIDO: Papaa's notes on the ship's log. It seems the First Mate has come forward with it - one Mr Stubbs. I could not find the log itself, but look at Papaa's markings - See the map positions - From December 29th, Captain Collingwood and his men directed the ship past no less than eight ports where, you .there was every opportunity to stop and replenish the ship's water supplies.
JOHN: Good Lord!
DIDO: And they did not! They either ignored the possibilities, or they were never in need.
JOHN: This.This is remarkable.
DIDO: Is it? Perhaps if you made these facts known, Mr Davinier
JOHN: But this places you in an impossible position with Lord His face searches hers.
DIDO: What is the alternative?
JOHN: Walk with me, Miss Lindsay. The back of the Inn has the Nobody but blind drunks.
LORD MANSFIELD: Where is everybody, Mabel? The carriages are gone.
MABEL: Lady Mansfield and Miss Murray are out calling, your lordship.
LORD MANSFIELD: And Dido also?
MABEL: Erm.I believe so.
LORD MANSFIELD: Well is she, or isn't she?
MABEL: Yes. She is, M'lord.
DIDO: Papaa would rather I see no ill, as though by ignoring it, it some how escapes me - perhaps by position but not.not by blood
JOHN: ( conciliatory ) The fault was never with you.
DIDO: Just as in life, we are no better in paintings.
JOHN: You were afraid.
DIDO: To be painted - to be painted beside Miss Murray And I ridiculed you.
JOHN: To be painted - to be painted beside Miss Murray And I ridiculed you.
DIDO: Do not feel ashamed. Elizabeth said something when we arrived in London. She said: we are but their property.
JOHN: Gentlemen's. We women are but the property of gentlemen. That is the way it is, in law and in life, is it not?
DIDO: Gentlemen's. We women are but the property of gentlemen. That is the way it is, in law and in life, is it not?
JOHN: I suppose you have, yes!
DIDO: Or have I? Must not a lady marry, even if she is financially secure? For who is she, without a husband of It seems silly - like a free negro who begs for a master!
JOHN: Unless she marries her equal. Her true equal - A man who respects her.
DIDO: I remember my Papaa's eyes. They were kind, gentle. a little like yours.
JOHN: ( embarrassed ) I mean.in colour. Grey. ( long beat ) He showed me much love, though I knew him only a few hours.
DIDO: ( embarrassed ) I mean.in colour. Grey. ( long beat ) He showed me much love, though I knew him only a few hours.
JOHN: That is terribly moving. What of your mother?
DIDO: She is a ghost in my life - present in my reflection, in each scowl I receive, yet I know very little of her than the colour she has given me.
JOHN: ( moved ) Then at the least, you know she was beautiful.
DIDO: I had never felt it.
JOHN: They observe each other a moment. Will they kiss? Dido pulls back, nervous of the intimacy.
DIDO: I am to marry, shortly - Mr Ashford.
JOHN: She begins to walk again - composing herself.
DIDO: He is amiable and of good family.
JOHN: Is it.what you want?
DIDO: The alternative is to replace Lady Mary in her responsibilities at Kenwood.
JOHN: But she is a spinster.
DIDO: Papaa did not trust I could achieve a match that might raise my rank - or even equal it.
JOHN: You.are above reducing yourself for the sake of rank.
DIDO: Is anyone home, Mabel?
MABEL: Lord Mansfield. I said you were out with Lady Mansfield and Miss Murray
ELIZABETH: Urghhh! What if I shall never find someone so.so incomparably suitable.and wealthy?!
DIDO: What if he is suitable but you do not feel.`yourself' with him?
ELIZABETH: Oh Dido! He understood me. And whenever.whenever. he looked at me.I somehow felt better in this world.
DIDO: Oh Bette, stop it! It is NOT love!!
ELIZABETH: Dido! You stop it, won't you? You know no more of love than I myself, do you?! Do you Dido?
DIDO: Beat. ELIZABETH swallows hard, disappointed.
ELIZABETH: Then what better right do you have to name what I am feeling than me?
LADY MANSFIELD: How charming. Is that not charming, Elizabeth? And tell me, are you an only son?
GENTLEMAN 1: I have six brothers, madam.
LADY MANSFIELD: SIX! Goodness!.all..?
GENTLEMAN 1: .all older, madam, yes.
LADY MANSFIELD: Is that not a most fascinating display?
BARONESS VERNON: Oh how dreadfully wonderful Lady M. Your girl is a picture.an utter picture! With her.'intended'?
LADY MANSFIELD: Indeed, Baroness Vernon.
BARONESS VERNON: ( re. ELIZABETH ) AND I see the other does not give up.so terribly endearing!
ELIZABETH: ( anxious ) Mamaa, Mr Vaughan approaches.
LADY MANSFIELD: Now I have checked and he has no London home, but I have good information he achieves an income no less than four thousand a year!
MR VAUGHAN: Miss Murray. Lady Mansfield.
ELIZABETH: ( earnest ) Oh most certainly.
MR VAUGHAN: Miss Murray, I wonder, if you might permit me to call upon you at home, sometime?
ELIZABETH: She looks to her mother, stunned, his gaze follows.
MR VAUGHAN: With her Ladyship's permission?
LADY MANSFIELD: I shall make arrangements.
LADY ASHFORD: A pity Lady Mansfield and I could not do business on James and Miss Murray.
LADY MARY: A greater pity you rejected her.
LADY ASHFORD: Let us not dwell on the unfortunate. Oliver and Miss Lindsay are a blissful match. Tell me, when exactly does she receive her inheritance?
DIDO: Oh, Mr James, your manners are as poor as your brother's finances.
JAMES: And you are foolish enough to marry him. I on the other have no better use for your impoverished cousin!.( beat ).Though she does make for rather amusing sport!
DIDO: That is painful, sir.
JAMES: Have you never been manhandled?
DIDO: It is not in my repertoire to keep company with beasts.
JAMES: With ease.
LADY ASHFORD: Oliver has been searching for you!
LADY MANSFIELD: Are you unwell, my dear?
ELIZABETH: Oh!..Mr James!
LADY ASHFORD: LADY ASHFORD closes her eyes,livid. VAUGHAN stands usurped.
JAMES: ( off Dido's reaction ) Miss Murray.
JOHN: I had never imagined myself to be married. But my aunt is determined. It is true that if one were to count, I had not even been acquainted with Miss Beresford on three occasions.
DIDO: Is she not terribly disappointed that you will not return to Hampstead?
JOHN: ( ironic ) my Aunt?
JOHN: Were you a curious child?
DIDO: Completely. Elizabeth, always asked the questions for me. then took blame for the impropriety when in fact she was protecting me! Dear, dear Bette.
DIDO: .I find myself unable to sleep. Papaa is to finally speak in a few days and.well.
JOHN: It is quite extraordinary .but I fear.I fear despite persuasive argument.your Papaa has not been I am not certain he is ready to go against the traders - they are some of the most powerful in these Isles - theirs are the finances that hold up England, after all. The enemies of any man who stood against the trade would be vicious.
DIDO: And yet if he does.stand up.IF he speaks the words and condemns the trade.The Lord Chief Justice of England.it may be impossible for the slave laws of England and its colonies to remain absolute. Is that correct?
JOHN: That.that is a fact.
CUT TO: 88 INT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. ENTRANCE HALL. DAY.19 88
ELIZABETH: I have heard nothing from him, since Vauxhall, Dido. I was certain an announcement was to be made any day.that he meant it this time!
DIDO: Then he is not a man of his word.
ELIZABETH: You would do that? For me?
DIDO: Bette, anything for you!
ELIZABETH: She hugs DIDO tight.
DIDO: I think you may be right.
ELIZABETH: Then I cannot thank you enough.
DIDO: ELIZABETH stands, brighter, smoothing her clothes.
ELIZABETH: I will ask Papaa to write immediately to Lady Ashford.
DIDO: DIDO gets up too, now.
ELIZABETH: DIDO gets up too, now.
DIDO: James Ashford is not kind. He is not a man to give your life or dowry to.
ELIZABETH: Then your gift comes with conditions.
DIDO: What then?
ELIZABETH: What then?
DIDO: I am trying.trying to make you see. He is not. appropriate!
ELIZABETH: Appropriate? The brother of the man you are to marry is not `appropriate' for me?
DIDO: He does not desire you, Bette! At least, even if he does, you would regret such a mistake. He.he laid his hands on me, Bette - in the most un-gentlemanly fashion.
ELIZABETH: Why should you say such a thing?
DIDO: He hurt me.
ELIZABETH: You are a liar!
DIDO: Why.why would I lie to you?
ELIZABETH: I don't know - but do you not see? Have you never been able to see? He would never touch you.!
DIDO: You are beneath him!
ELIZABETH: You are beneath him!
DIDO: I am beneath him??
ELIZABETH: Yes. You.you are.
DIDO: What! Tell me! What am I, Bette?
ELIZABETH: .You.you are..( courage leaves her ).You are illegitimate!!
DIDO: My mother and father never married - you are correct. But my father acknowledged me as his child. It is yours who refuses to legitimise your position, Bette - that is why you are poor! And that is why it is not me who is beneath Mr James, Bette. It is not me!
MABEL: ( worried whisper ) Miss Lindsay. Are you out again?
DIDO: ( terrified )
LORD MANSFIELD: This man's ambitions include you. You will endure shame and risk your position for a man without name, who will sully yours and drag your reputation to the gutter!
JOHN: ( bitter and humiliated ) I take great offence in your summation of my character without ever even taking a moment to know me. Where is your right?
LORD MANSFIELD: .I have EVERY right.!
JOHN: .No! That you will never have! Not until you cease from judging the entire world as those above and those below and begin to see people as PEOPLE! Human beings, who think and feel no more or less than you do!
LORD MANSFIELD: I know there is a lady in Belsize who is waiting to be your wife.
JOHN: No! I have an ambitious aunt in Belsize, who like you, assumes reputation and fortune are all that life depends on, and despises love as though it were the devil's own creation!
LORD MANSFIELD: Love? You claim love..??
DIDO: NO! STOP! Papaa, you must stop!
JOHN: Yes.yes I love her! I love her with every breath I breathe.
DIDO: Go John. You do not deserve this.
LORD MANSFIELD: Captain Sir John Lindsay would never behave like this because he was never HERE!.You are destroying your possibilities with the only gentleman who will consider you. Is that what you want?
LORD MANSFIELD: Arrogant.parasite! HE is filling her with worthless ideals. He wants to `make the world a better place'!.
LADY MANSFIELD: You said something identical, once.
LORD MANSFIELD: I never broke the rules.
LADY MANSFIELD: Did you not? You simply became powerful enough to make new ones. I always felt you already loved me when I gave you my hand. Not that you said it but. something in the way you looked at me.
LORD MANSFIELD: As though she were created of you and I.( poignant ).And that is why I simply do not want to see her diminished.
LADY MARY: The niece of the Marquess of Winchester. Mr James Ashford is to marry the niece of the Marquess of Winchester.
LADY MANSFIELD: ( sardonic ) That shall render your future mother-in-law ecstatic, Dido.
ELIZABETH: Don't you dare say a word.
DIDO: I won't.
ELIZABETH: Why! Why do they ALWAYS do that!!
DIDO: Who, Bette?
ELIZABETH: Men! They leave and never come back!
ELIZABETH: I saw you with him, that day. At the pleasure garden.
DIDO: You said nothing.
ELIZABETH: I wanted you to tell me. To trust me.
DIDO: I should have.
ELIZABETH: You know, if I had your choice, I would choose.the man I loved I simply hope he is worth it.
LADY ASHFORD: I am not in the habit of requiring explanation more than TWICE! But on this occasion, you will have to forgive me.
LORD MANSFIELD: ( burdened ) Lady Ashford there is little point in repetition.
LADY ASHFORD: Then let me be clear that I have understood. Your charge - your mulatto charge.
LADY MANSFIELD: ( fiercely protective ) That is enough!
OLIVER: ( to Lady Mansfield ) Is it not true enough, your .whose unfortunate circumstances of birth, we chose to forgive - has decided she no longer wishes the match with my son - a gentleman and an officer.
LADY ASHFORD: .whose unfortunate circumstances of birth, we chose to forgive - has decided she no longer wishes the match with my son - a gentleman and an officer.
OLIVER: Why, Miss Lindsay?
LADY ASHFORD: ( poignant and pained ) Do you feel I have any lesser need to ensure my child's wellbeing and future than you?.( beat ).Does she still have a tongue?
DIDO: I have a tongue, Madam. Though yours explains well enough why I may not marry your son.beat ). You view my circumstances as unfortunate, though I cannot claim even a portion of the misfortune of those to whom I most closely resemble.
DIDO: Why did I, slave, beyond my lot
DIDO: Will it?
LORD MANSFIELD: Why should that surprise you?
DIDO: Why should it not?
LORD MANSFIELD: What are you reading?
DIDO: Poetry. A gentleman named Thomas Day. He speaks of a slave who agreed to marry a free woman. A voice to people.people like my mother - who do not have one.
LORD MANSFIELD: You find yourself in such writing?
DIDO: I don't know that I find myself anywhere. I have no place that I may claim.
LORD MANSFIELD: What is it that you want, Dido? What precisely are you searching for? I enabled every rule of heritage so that you could know exactly where you belong. Yet little appears enough for you!
DIDO: Papaa, you enabled every rule, but you had to overlook just as many to raise me within good society. And what if there were not a rule Papaa? What if that rule that allowed you to take me did not exist? Would you have returned me to the slums?
LORD MAYOR: Look at them - For and against at each other's throats! How on earth did the damn quakers find their way into here!..( beat )..You are a brave man, negotiating these quarters on the eve of your judgement.
LORD MANSFIELD: You did not become Lord Mayor through being a coward.
LORD MAYOR: Finally you are to speak, then. If England is destroyed we shall blame you!
JOHN: And failing that does the law not have a duty?
LORD MANSFIELD: Why does it matter to you so?
JOHN: M'lord..! It..it is a misuse of the clause. It is not for human lives. It is for goods.. Chattel.
LORD MANSFIELD: ( factual ) It is for property!
JOHN: I HAVE SEEN YOUR NOTES!! If they wanted water they could have had it!
LORD MANSFIELD: If you find for the traders, you will be formalizing in law the concept of insuring `human' cargo.
JOHN: If you find for the traders, you will be formalizing in law the concept of insuring `human' cargo.
LORD MANSFIELD: That is correct!.( to his driver ).Drive!
JOHN: Then know that when you are gone, your legacy will be to have left Miss Lindsay in a world that says she may be worth more dead, than She is not a slave.
LORD MANSFIELD: She is not a slave.
JOHN: By the very grace of God!
LORD MANSFIELD: This is not about Miss Lindsay.
JOHN: Of course it is! It's about all of us. It's about everything. everything that is important!
LORD MANSFIELD: Mr Davinier, the world is a devastating place. You must learn to protect your emotions if you are to prevent matters of both law..and love from devastating you.
LADY MANSFIELD: Smooth your dress, young lady!
LADY MANSFIELD: Mr Vaughan, how kind of you to come.
ELIZABETH: I have thought of nothing else but showing you Aunt Mary's chrysanthemums, Mr Vaughan.
MR VAUGHAN: What a pleasure, Miss Murray.
ELIZABETH: You too Mamaa.
HARRY: NO! Never again!
DIDO: Fine! Then step down and allow me to take the reigns.
HARRY: Had I known you were to be such trouble, I'd `ave driven off before Captain Sir John Lindsay bought you to my carriage!
CLERK: Silence in the court!
LORD MANSFIELD: Whether the `jettison clause' of Marine Insurance Law may be brought to bear in this appeal. This is the question. That is, first: whether the slaves were drowned as an anticipatory act. An act to avoid the disease caused by their
DIDO: Gasps from around the room.gasps that turn into cries, including DIDO'S own. JOHN is rigid, anger rising.
LORD MANSFIELD: The ship's owners chose a tight `packing fashion' to transport the slaves.A popular fashion of transportation that is known for causing death and disease.
CLERK: All rise!
DIDO: You may not blame Mr Davinier .My attendance today is absolutely at my own volition .for matters which concern me.
LORD MANSFIELD: I am fully aware, Dido.
JOHN: M'Lord.I am inspired by your decision today. We will not go backwards from here.
LORD MANSFIELD: ( burdened ) History will judge if your optimism is warranted.( beat ). You are a man of conviction.
JOHN: I am trying to be.
LORD MANSFIELD: Then your efforts are not in vain.
DIDO: And Mr Davinier is not a gentleman?
LORD MANSFIELD: He is.indeed.Dido. And that is why he ought to have a job befitting one.
DIDO: ( a whisper - defiant ) My affections are with him, Papaa. I wish for nothing. nothing, if not to be his wife.
LORD MANSFIELD: If you would Mr Davinier, I would like you to attend my chambers in the morning. There are matters I would like you to assist me with.
JOHN: Your Lordship?
LORD MANSFIELD: And if you think it a good idea.I wish to facilitate your entry to the Inns of Court.
JOHN: ( tentative ) That is to serve my qualification to The Bar?
LORD MANSFIELD: Indeed.( humbled ).Capabilities such as yours are clearly deserving of such considerations.
JOHN: I..I think it a very good idea, sir.
DIDO: Of course. He sees what I see. His words were as clear as.
JOHN: No! That your feelings for me are so? That you would be my wife..? Because, I cannot conceive of a life without you.and if.if such were all that were before me, Miss Lindsay, then my heart would never beat the same again.
DIDO: It is not. It is not all that is before you Mr Davinier. ( begins sobbing ) I love you.for all that you are, and with all..all that I am.
