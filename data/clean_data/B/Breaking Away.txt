"BAMBINO": [ PRODUCED AS "BREAKING AWAY" ]
FADE IN: EXT. QUARRY OUTSKIRTS - DAY 1 A narrow dirt road totally surrounded by thick vegetation. Here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the road. The sun is shining but it has a hard time making it through the foliage. In the distance we see four guys walking TOWARD the CAMERA. There is a swagger to their walk. MIIï¿½ is singing. The others are humming along. The melody of the song of "0 Bury Me Not On the Lone Prairie" but it's a loose version.
MIME: AND WHEN I DIE.WON'T YOU BURY ME ON THE"PARKING LOT OF THE A AND P BLOW OUT THE CANDLES AND BLOW OUT TIE LAMPS AND LIGHT MY PYRE WITH MY TRADING STAMPS I HAD TWO BOOKS BUT I NEEDED THREE R TO DELIVER ME FROM THE A AND P.

MOOCHER is very short. DAVE, hanging back a little, is carrying a large trophy.
DAVE: Bravo, Mike! Bravo! Bellisimot
CYRIL: Did you really make all that up? They pass.
ANOTHER ANGLE: The presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now. More and more blocks of cut stone appear. The guys are dwarfed by them. They have to climb over some.
MIKE: I sent away for this stuff from Wyoming. It'll tell you everything. Since you don't believe me maybe you'll believe it when you see it.
CYRIL: And we'd work on the same ranch and sleep in the bunkhouse together, eh? REVISED '"BAMBINO" - 6/16/78 2 1 Cont.

MIKE: What's that mean?
DAVE: You don't work. You don't eat.
CYRIL: That's a terrible thing to say.
MED. SHOT: The quarries are felt even more now. Walls of stone rise up around the guys.
CYRIL: Are you really going to shave your legs?

MIKE: You leave home.
CYRIL: My dad says Jesus never went further than fifty miles from his home. Mike is skipping down the rocks toward the water, taking clothes off as he does. The rest follow.
MIKE: And look what happened to him. Mike jumps into the water. Moocher and Cyril follow. Dave looks on.
DAVE: Oggi fa bello,-non e vero?
MIKE: Sure thing, partner.
MOOCHER: C'mon in.
DAVE: I read where this Italian coach said you should never swim after a race.
CYRIL: Who's swimming? I'm taking a Moocher and Mike splash water at him and swim away.

MIKE: How come you're so stupid, Cyril.
CYRIL: I don't know. I think I have a dumb heredity. What's your excuse, Mike? Mike hits him hard on the arm. Cyril winces. Mike stands up. He makes sure they're all watching and dives in. The guys talk as they follow his progress.
DAVE: You hear from your folks, Moocher? 567 Cont.
MOOCHER: He wanted to know if the house was sold. They could use the You can come and live with me when it's sold. In Italy everybody lives together. All three of them are getting concerned about Mike.

CYRIL: I .wouldn't mind thinking I was s omebody myself. All three of them stand up.
MOOCHER: Maybe the door is stuck. God Moocher dives in. Dave and Cyril follow. Moocher swims down to the icebox, forces the door open. They surface. As soon as they hit the surface we hear:
MIKE: Yoohoo .
MIKE: It's got no back on it! He laughs triumphantly. He's ready to dive in again when he pauses and looks. High above where he stands on the other side of the quarry hole, we see several figures. The guys are swimming toward the rocks and looking at the figures too. 5667 Cont.
MIKE: What the hell are they doing here? X
ANOTHER ANGLE: Dave, Moocher and Cyril are standing on the rocks below Mike. Mike is still on top of the rock. High above him are the College Kids. Three guys and three girls. One of the guys is standing on the ledge above the water. Our guys are looking at the College Kid on the ledge. He seems intent on diving into the water. It's a distance of at least eighty feet. He pushes off and dives in executing a beautiful somersault into a swan dive.
CYRIL: I've never seen anyone dive off from there.

CYRIL: This hole! This quarry hole is mine!
MIKE: Hey, screw you, Cyril. Let's get out of here.

MOOCHER: Isn't your dad working today?
DAVE: ( o.s. ) No, the doctor told him to take it easy. He's taking Sunday's off.
CYRIL: ( OÂ¢SÂ¢ )
MOOCHER: ( o.s. ) Yeah, so what? Cyril laughs and then howls as he's hit.
CYRIL: Going to college must do'something 'to girls' tits. Just look at them. Campussies and sororititties. ( sticks head out; shouts to a couple of Girls ) - Hi, there. What's your major? The Girls look up and kind of sneer.
MOOCHER: They sure look like they've got it made.

DAVE: Italians are all poor but they're Maybe in Italy. 7 Cont.
MIKE: Maybe in Italy. 7 Cont.
CYRIL: I wonder what it's like to kiss a coed. I wonder about it a lot. Ahead of Mike's car we see two Guys and two Girls playing Frisbee. They are standing on the lawns and throwing the Frisbee to each other across the street. Mike's car is moving slowly forward when an ill-thrown Frisbee lands on the street. Mike sees it and speeds up. A Girl is running to get it but Mike gets there first and runs over it. Dave gets a quick look at the Girl as she stops"suddenly to keep from getting hit. The two college Guys run out and give' Mike the finger. He sees them in the rearview mirror.
MIKE: Hey, those bastards are giving us the finger. He slams on the brakes.
MOOCHER: Hey, c'mon, Mike. We're on their turf. Dave is looking back at the Girl. The two Guys are challenging Mike, motioning to him to come back. The two Girls are trying to talk them out of it. Mike-is gunning the car.
MIKE: They think they own the place.
MOOCHER: They do.
CYRIL: Besides, you've humiliated them enough. In ancient Japan when you ran over a samurai's Frisbee he had to commit suicide. Just as he laughs Mike shifts the car in reverse. The two Guys and Girls are standing in the middle of the road. The Guys are coming forward thinking Mike's going to stop, but Mike has no intention of stopping. The Girls and the Guys split as Mike's car roars between them. Once again Dave catches a fleeting glimpse of the Girl. Having scattered them, Mike makes a U-turn and drives away in the direction he came from. REVISED - "BAMBINO" 8/12/78 10 7 Cont.1

Moocher is very short. They are walking out of step. All the other teams are matched in height to accommodate the use of a bike w.th a set saddle position.
