"BACHELOR PARTY": Screenplay by Neal Israel & Pat Proft
THE BOYS: ( softly; in unison ) Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.
THE BOYS: ( louder ) Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school bus. It practically takes the last turn on just two wheels. The bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear-splitting halt right in front of them. The front door immediately swings open and RICK STAHL, the driver, hops out. Rick is the life of the party, even when there isn't any party going on. While chronologically older than the St. Luke students, the only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a driver's license. Rick figures he'll live up to his capabilities and get serious in his next life. This incarnation's strictly for laughs. Sister Mary Francis steps up to him.
RICK: I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
RICK: You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
RICK: Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
RICK: Right. Think it over.
RICK: ( over mike ) If you don't all calm down I'm gonna drive this thing over a cliff.
RICK: ( continuing; philosophically ) Ah. youth.
PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV: We're LOOKING THROUGH the camera lens. We SEE a cute one- year-old baby boy. He's sitting on a cuddly blanket. We HEAR the VOICE of Jay O'Neill. He is a baby photographer at Sears.
O'NEILL: We see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest of the store. He's conservatively dressed in a suit, vest and tie. He looks like he could be a Young Republican. But under those Sears clothes is a man a little off center. Rick's best friend. Need we say more? He takes the film out of the camera. The matronly mother is in the process of gathering up her baby.
O'NEILL: These should be in the mail to you by next Friday.
O'NEILL: ( continuing )
O'NEILL: ( continuing ) Whoa. Look at those babies.
O'NEILL: ( continuing ) How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are.?
WOMAN: ( teasing ) Mrs. Klupner.
O'NEILL: I'm separated.
WOMAN: I'm separated.
O'NEILL: Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
O'NEILL: ( continuing ) If I were you, I'd breast feed until I was 17 or 18. ( gets behind camera; sizing up the shot ) Tell ya what.
O'NEILL: He gets out from behind the camera.
O'NEILL: I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
WOMAN: ( seductively ) Of course.
O'NEILL: He runs from behind the camera and poses with the woman.
RICK: enters and witnesses the photo session. He immediately jumps into the shots.
THE WOMAN: As Rick and O'Neill continue mugging like two 12-year-olds in a photo booth, the Woman takes her child and exits. A few beats pass and the guys notice they're alone.
O'NEILL: Where'd she go?
RICK: She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink. I have major news to announce.
O'NEILL: Okay. be right with ya.
RICK: He picks up some photographs of today's work.

RICK: I've decided not to run for President.
CHULO: Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
ANGLE: The guys all start to pile into the bus. Nearby another employee is washing down the garage with a hose. Chulo turns to another mechanic, who has his head under the hood of a car.
CHULO: Manuel, be sure and finish up the electrical system on that Chevy.

RICK: Mr. Thomerson, I.
MR. THOMERSON: Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some Feel free.
RICK: Feel free.
MR. THOMERSON: First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life.
MRS. THOMERSON: I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
DEBBIE: Great, Mom.
ILENE: If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
DEBBIE: Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
ILENE: Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
DEBBIE: Ilene, Rick promised.

STAN: ( through clenched teeth ) I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
RYKO: Can you believe how perfect it fits?
STAN: Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
O'NEILL: Hey, you guys.
RICK: Who's your friend?
STAN: ( keeping it a surprise ) Oh. it's. er. the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
RICK: ( to moose ) I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
RICK: ( continuing ) Say no more.
MANAGER: I don't know which one of you did this, but you're not going anywhere till you clean up this disgusting Anybody got a paper towel or a shovel or something?
O'NEILL: ( resigned ) Anybody got a paper towel or a shovel or something?
MANAGER: I'll have the boy take your bags up.
MANAGER: ( to couple ) Excuse me. I seem to have a hand full of potty.
EXECUTIVE: Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
MR. THOMERSON: Any time, Al.
MR. THOMERSON: Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
COLE: ( nearly hysterical ) The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down.
MR. THOMERSON: Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
COLE: MR. THOMERSON ( disgusted )
MR. THOMERSON: All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself. You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
COLE: Yes, sir.
RICK: Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
LARRY: It's Bullwinkle.
O'NEILL: Gentlemen. Ladies. For your viewing pleasure, meet Mike the Magical Sexual Mule.
RICK: ( surprised ) How about this, a Trojan donkey.
O'NEILL: And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree.
RICK: Swell. She's gonna pin her tail on the donkey.
THE DONKEY: It's had enough cole slaw. Now it sniffs at Larry's drug smorgasbord and then starts to chomp on a few pills. Next it sticks its head into the lines of coke and snorts them up in one gigantic sniff.
DESIREE: C'mon, Mike. Come to Mama.
CHULO: ( excited ) Hey, you guys, I'm getting married. ( to Laverne ) We're gonna make lots of kids.
CHULO: What the hell happened?
STAN: Drug overdose.
DESIREE: You mean it's.
STAN: Afraid so. I did everything I could.
LARRY: It's my fault. He's dead because. I left those drugs.
RICK: It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's C'mon, we gotta get this thing out of here.
O'NEILL: C'mon, we gotta get this thing out of here.
MANAGER: ( on phone ) Yes. I see. Of course we don't allow that sort of thing here, ma'am. No. Well, I'm sorry the noise woke you. I'll take care of it right away.
MANAGER: I've had enough of this.
MANAGER: ( continuing ) That's it. I'm calling the cops.
RICK: Welcome, welcome, one and all.
RICK: ( recognizing the voice ) Oh, no!
RICK: Christ. it's Mr. Laughs.
MR. THOMERSON: This is it. You're through. When Debbie hears about this she'll never see you again. Now I'm calling the cops to break up this sex orgy. And toss your ass in jail! What are you going to do about it?
O'NEILL: What are you going to do about it?
RICK: ( defeated ) What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole I'll stop him. You stall him.
O'NEILL: I'll stop him. You stall him.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Mr. Thomerson is heading for the phone in the bedroom.
RICK: Mr. Thomerson!
RICK: ( continuing; dramatic ) Please, no. Don't ruin my life.
RICK: ( continuing ) It's not me. I was brought up on the wrong side of the tracks. A victim of my environment.
O'NEILL: Is that all the coke in the place?
LARRY: That's it.
O'NEILL: O'Neill unscrews the mouthpiece off the phone. He pours the bag of cocaine into the phone. He then screws the mouthpiece back on over this mound of powder. Satisfied with his work, he exits the bedroom.
RICK: My poor old mammy had to take in laundry. My pappy had to work 20 hours a day at the Pez Factory.
ANOTHER ANGLE: O'Neill gestures to Rick that everything's ready. Rick immediately jumps to his feet.
RICK: The end.
MR. THOMERSON: No sob story is going to change my
O'NEILL: The phone's all yours.
MR. THOMERSON: I never liked you. I've never liked any of your friends. I've hated you from the first time I saw you. And now you are out of my life. You are out of my life!

RICK: ( yelling back ) Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.

RICK: Cole, what the hell are you doing?
COLE: She's mine!
RICK: He's kidnapped her! Everyone into the bus!
COLE: Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
MAINTENANCE TRUCK: Our man with the cones is almost completely exhausted.
COLE: He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
RICK: Fan out and look for them.
RYKO: Aw, I've seen this one already.
MAN: ( to LADY next to him ) Gee, what a realistic effect.
WOMAN: Yeah, like you're in the movie with

FATHER FALWELL: FATHER FALWELL
FATHER FALWELL: Now, before I pronounce you man and wife, the groom wishes to recite his vow to Debbie. Richard.
THOMERSONS: They fear the worst.
MR. THOMERSON: Oh, God Almighty.
RICK: He turns to Debbie. He waits a beat and begins.
RICK: Cheese. I love you more than cheese. And I love cheese a lot.
THOMERSONS: They hide their faces in their hands. Off in the distance a storm is coming in fast over the ocean. The wind begins to pick up. Undaunted, Rick continues his soliloquy.
RICK: In fact, more than dairy products in general. I love dairy. My love is cream. Pour me on the cereal of your
FATHER FALWELL: He wants this to end. He calls softly to Rick, trying to get his attention.
FATHER FALWELL: Rick. Rick. Hey.
