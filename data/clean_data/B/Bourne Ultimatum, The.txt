SMASH CUT: MOTION flat out it's us we're running stumbling breathing rushed blood in the snow. We are JASON BOURNE and we're running down an alley. Supered below: MOSCOW BLUE LIGHTS from the distance strobing through the night rushing toward us POLICE CARS three of them - - SIRENS HOWLING as they bear down closer faster until they whip past the alley. Up against the wall BOURNE is hidden in the shadows. BOURNE is badly wounded shot through the shoulder bruises and broken bones from the final car chase in
POLICEMAN #1: Put your hands on your head and turn around slowly!
BOURNE: ( in Russian ) Give me your gun and radio.
BOURNE: ( in Russian ) My argument is not with you.

THUMP!: We think that's Bourne hitting him on the head and then
CRONIN: We think that's Bourne hitting him on the head and then
KRAMER: Who's "she?"
LANDY: His girlfriend, Marie. She was killed in India three weeks ago. A dirty section chief in league with a corrupt Russian Billionaire commits suicide when confronted by Jason Bourne. You couldn't make this stuff up. You watched this happen? Bourne's last confirmed location is Moscow, three days ago?
KRAMER: A dirty section chief in league with a corrupt Russian Billionaire commits suicide when confronted by Jason Bourne. You couldn't make this stuff up. You watched this happen? Bourne's last confirmed location is Moscow, three days ago?
KRAMER: Bourne's last confirmed location is Moscow, three days ago?
LANDY: So what does he do now?
KRAMER: So what does he do now?
LANDY: I think he's looking for something he hasn't found.
KRAMER: Like what? What's he after?
LANDY: I'm not sure. Maybe he hasn't gotten his memory back yet. Not all of it.
KRAMER: Pam, what I need to know is, what kind of a threat is he to us?
LANDY: If he just wanted to hurt us he could have sent this tape to CNN.
KRAMER: Maybe he still will. Maybe he gave it to you because he wants to throw you in the opposite direction of his real plan. I don't know. I just know my number one rule is "the only way to stay safe is to assume the worst." As far as I'm concerned Bourne is a serious threat until proven otherwise.
ROSS: ( with poster ) .This one's three years ago had half of Interpol after him disappeared.Turned up in Naples Berlin Moscow disappeared again. ( Daniels says nothing ) The girl he was on he run with Marie Kreutz she turned up dead halfway around the world, from a sniper's bullet. ( beat ) What connects the dots? Is it Turn off that tape recorder.
DANIELS: Turn off that tape recorder.
MARTIN: Where is my sister?
BOURNE: She's dead. She was killed.
MARTIN: I knew it was going to end this way. It was always going to end this way.
BOURNE: I didn't believe that.
MARTIN: Why did she die?
BOURNE: She was shot. A man came for me.
MARTIN: And then you killed him.
MARTIN: Now what?
BOURNE: Someone started all this.and I'm going to find them.
BOURNE: ( in French ) Who started Treadstone?
ELLATRACHE: ( in French, to It's OK! ( in French, to Bourne ) They're still looking for you. You are taking a big risk coming
BOURNE: ( in French ) Just tell me what I want to know!
ELLATRACHE: ( in French ) I just provided them weapons. I don't know who started
BOURNE: ( in French ) You know something. Tell me where to start looking.
ELLATRACHE: ( in French ) There's a journalist in London. Simon Ross. He seems to know a lot about you. He has a source inside the program. Someone there from the beginning. What should I tell them if they contact me?
BOURNE: ( in English ) They give me the name I want, or I burn their entire house down to get it.
ROSS: .This is big a skein of lies you pull at it and it just keeps coming I'll fill you in when I get home. And it's not finished, either. They're calling it `Blackbriar'.
BLACKBRIAR: A TECHNICIAN sends the data to NSA back in the States.Where another COMPUTER gathers up the rest of the phone call.As we listen.
TECH#3: "Blackbriar" echelon hit. NSA, please confirm receipt.
TECHNICIAN #1: Sir, we intercepted a call from London, keyword "Blackbriar."
SUPERVISOR: Okay, send it to CRI right now.
WILLS: We tracked the phone. Registered to a London reporter named Simon Ross. He works at the Guardian
VOSEN: You tracking him?
WILLS: Yeah, thanks Mike. We have a survey team covering him at work.and a sneak and peek's on their way to his apartment.
VOSEN: Well, who talked to him? How did he find out about Blackbriar?
WILLS: We don't know, we pulled his background and ran a cross check on any known anomalies, but we've come up with nothing. But, I think if we follow Ross, we are going to be able.
VOSEN: Right. Ross is easy. I want the
VOSEN: Is that all?
WILLS: I want rendition protocols and I want the asset put on standby, just in case.
VOSEN: I want rendition protocols and I want the asset put on standby, just in case.

I want all his phones, his blackberry, his apartment, his car, bank accounts, credit cards, travel patterns.I want to know what he's going to think before he does. Every dirty little secret he has. And most of all, we want the name and real time location of his source. This is NSA priority level 4, any

EDITOR: Scared of what?
ROSS: A REPORTER sticks her head in.
REPORTER: Sorry, a call for you.
ROSS: Who is it?
REPORTER: Won't give hie name.
REPORTER: He's on my line. Simon Ross.
VOSEN: Why aren't we hearing this?

VOSEN?: Grab Team B. Grab the hoody and stay with Ross.
BOURNE: Take the footbridge. Go to the West Entrance. I'll meet you at the newsstand.
VOSEN: No, no, look.Ross is not on the bus. Split up the team get the guy on the bus and send someone to stay on Ross.
AGENT ONE: ( to Hoody ) You. On the floor. Down.
AGENT TWO: Driver, stop the bus!
TECHNICIAN #2: We've lost signal.
TECHNICIAN #1: What happened to Survey One?
VOSEN: I don't like this. Patch me through to Met surveillance.
BOURNE: Why do you know so much about me?
ROSS: The article. You talked to someone from Treadstone. Someone there at the beginning. What's his name?
BOURNE: The article. You talked to someone from Treadstone. Someone there at the beginning. What's his name?
ROSS: I can't tell you that.. Who's following me?
BOURNE: Whoever they are it's trouble.
ROSS: Are they Blackbriar?
BOURNE: Blackbriar, what's Blackbriar?

BOURNE: He's got a gun.
ROSS: He's got a gun.
BOURNE: Negative. Keep straight ahead.

VOSEN: We're losing him! We cannot afford to lose him!
VOICE: Waterloo concourse. Subject heading east.
BOURNE: Get into cover. Now!
VOSEN: In place in one minute.
WILLS: In place in one minute.
VOSEN: Alright, I want to take him now. Get him out of there and have the asset cover it.
VOICE: Target moving towards the stores.
ANOTHER VOICE: Asset in play. ETA thirty seconds. All exits covered.
BOURNE: Keep moving.
BOURNE: BOURNE searching the concourse. Something bothering him. The threat level clicking another notch.
INSIDE!: BOURNE searching the concourse. Something bothering him. The threat level clicking another notch.
BOURNE: Service doorway Now!
TECHY 2: Store. Three means of egress.
VOSEN: Close him down.
BOURNE: Keep moving.
VOSEN: Jesus Christ, that's Jason Maybe he's the source?
WILLS: Maybe he's the source?
VOSEN: It doesn't matter, the asset now has 2 targets. Take them both
BOURNE: I'm going to get you to safety but you have to stay calm do exactly what I say.
ROSS: ( fear-induced autopilot ) Sure, okay.
BOURNE: No, listen to me: Exactly what I say this time. Understand?
ROSS: Stay here while I look for an
BOURNE: Stay here while I look for an
BOURNE: No, stay behind that door.
WILLS: There. That silver door. Bourne's behind that door?
TECH: Okay, pull the agents back and give Bourne's location to the
WILLS: Okay, pull the agents back and give Bourne's location to the
SCOPE POV: A shape barely visible moving behind the window. ( It's Ross but Paz and the Hub think it's Bourne.
SCOPE POV: The door comes open slightly, but from this angle Paz doesn't have a clean shot at his target ( who he thinks is Bourne ).
BOURNE: Don't move until I tell you.
ROSS: I'm going to go for it.
BOURNE: No, No not now.
VOSEN: Then suddenly Vosen snaps back to focus:
WILLS: What about Bourne?
VOSEN: Get him out of there - NOW!
BOURNE'S POV: Watching PAZ from the platform as he SAGS down onto a seat, nauseated, his skin clammy, his head pounding.He takes out the PILLS and dry-swallows them.Looks up.
KRAMER: It's Vosen. We have a situation.
VOSEN: It's Vosen. We have a situation.
VOSEN: ( to waiter ) Sparkling. And a "Heart-Healthy" omelet with goat cheese and
VOSEN: You're late. Traffic?
WAITER: ( handing her the menu ) Nothing for me.
LANDY: Nothing for me.
VOSEN: I'm buying.
VOSEN: When the Director called, it was suggested we bring you on
LANDY: ( beat ) Are you sure it was just a Funny how different things look depending on where you sit. I look at this as doing a favor for you. Giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished Jason Bourne.
VOSEN: Funny how different things look depending on where you sit. I look at this as doing a favor for you. Giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished Jason Bourne.
LANDY: Jason Bourne.
VOSEN: Jason Bourne.
LANDY: Bourne's finished.
VOSEN: It was finished the moment I realized I was chasing him for something he didn't do. The case is closed.
LANDY: It was finished the moment I realized I was chasing him for something he didn't do. The case is closed.
VOSEN: So what do you make of this? French intel picked up Bourne meeting Pierre Elattrache on Tuesday. He threatened to burn our house down if you didn't tell him who started Treadstone. That's a big problem, wouldn't you agree?
LANDY: This doesn't feel like Bourne to Why's it so hard for you to Probably because it's coming from you, Noah.
VOSEN: Why's it so hard for you to Probably because it's coming from you, Noah.
LANDY: Probably because it's coming from you, Noah.
VOSEN: Lets try and be adults okay? We all thought he was done, off the grid. But Bourne's back. Maybe he's a threat. We both want the same thing here.
LANDY: So what happened at Waterloo?
VOSEN: We have a leak. Bourne showed up in our surveillance. We had very little time to react.
LANDY: And the reporter ended up dead?
VOSEN: Bourne saw us coming.
LANDY: So what was he doing?
VOSEN?: We don't know. But just the fact that he was there means he's up to something, don't you think? Maybe he's the source?
LANDY: The real question is how you managed to get in a fire fight in the middle of a public train Don't second guess an operation from an armchair, Pam. It's not I'm going to the office now. I'll make my own introductions.
VOSEN: Don't second guess an operation from an armchair, Pam. It's not I'm going to the office now. I'll make my own introductions.
LANDY: I'm going to the office now. I'll make my own introductions.
WILLS: This is Pamela Landy. She's gonna be quarterbacking our search effort. I think what we oughta do, just to get started, let's go around the room, say who you are and what your spec is.
LANDY: Let's do names later. ( she's got the floor ) What's Bourne's last fixed ( impatient ) London. Twelve hundred Zulu.
TECH#3: London. Twelve hundred Zulu.
LANDY: Status? Wounded? Armed?
TECH#2: Alive. Mobile. Unknown.
LANDY: Where are your grids coming from?
TECH#1: NSA Tactical.
LANDY: You have an Echelon package?
TECH#1: Why isn't it on?
LANDY: Why isn't it on?
TECH#1: We were waiting.
LANDY: For what? You're nine hours behind the toughest target you've ever tracked. I want everyone to sit down, strap in, and turn on all you've got. That would mean now.
TECH#1: Sir, we just hacked Ross's email account at the Guardian and found a round trip ticket to Turin, yesterday. 0800 arrival, 12:05 I think we can be pretty certain that Bourne's not your source Ross's call to his editor, where he said he just met the source on Blackbriar, took place just after his flight landed. His met his source in Turin.
LANDY: I think we can be pretty certain that Bourne's not your source Ross's call to his editor, where he said he just met the source on Blackbriar, took place just after his flight landed. His met his source in Turin.
VOSEN: Ross's call to his editor, where he said he just met the source on Blackbriar, took place just after his flight landed. His met his source in Turin.
LANDY: Ross's call to his editor, where he said he just met the source on Blackbriar, took place just after his flight landed. His met his source in Turin.
VOSEN: So, what, Bourne met Ross for breakfast and then, at noon the same day Bourne calls Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo?
LANDY: So, what, Bourne met Ross for breakfast and then, at noon the same day Bourne calls Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo?
CRONIN: ( Needling Wills ) Maybe they were even on the same Cross check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with Blackbriar SCI clearance against all calls in and out of Turin during the morning Ross was there
VOSEN: Cross check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with Blackbriar SCI clearance against all calls in and out of Turin during the morning Ross was there
LANDY: The guy you're after is a CIA operative with clearance above Top Secret. He was committing treason by talking to Ross. Do you really think, while doing that, he used a cell phone he knows we can track?
WILLS: Do you have a better idea?
LANDY: Yeah, I'd look at all the people whose cell phones were switched off the entire period Ross was in Do it Jimmy.
WILLS: Do it Jimmy.
LANDY: ( looks at Cronin ) I mean if your people use their cell phones as much as mine do, the list should be pretty small
LANDY: Now check everything in Ross's apartment against those names. Look for common patterns, look for -
CRONIN: Initials ...Bring that up on
LANDY: Neal Daniels. He's Station Chief in Madrid now, isn't he?
WILLS: Jesus Christ.
VOSEN: Call the RSO at the Embassy and have them take Daniels into custody if he's there. If he's not, get a grab team to the Calle Norte safe house. Send them in heavy and tell them we'll assist with entry.
LANDY: "Heavy?" Daniels isn't
VOSEN: I'm worried about Bourne. If he's not Ross's source, then he must be after Ross's source just like us.
VOSEN: Team two, ETA Callee Norte?
TECH#3: Sir, they're at the front door.
HAMMOND: We're in.
VOSEN: Okay, put it live.
HAMMOND: Alarm's down.
VOSEN: That has to be Bourne.
HAMMOND: ( into mike ) Safe's cleaned out.
VOSEN: Shit. Track the passports.
VOSEN: Goddamn it! Get a back-up team in there!
VOSEN: How long till back-up arrives?
VOSEN: How long? Stop! Hang on. I have an
BOURNE: What are you doing here?
NICKY: I was posted here after Berlin.
BOURNE: Where's Daniels?
VOSEN: Who is this?
VOSEN: Nicky, I need to do an ID challenge first. Code in:
NICKY: Response: "Everest".
VOSEN: Nicky, this is Noah Vosen. How long have you been on site?
VOSEN: We have two officers on site. Are you in contact with them?
VOSEN: Is there any sign of Daniels?
LANDY: Nicky, this is Pam Landy. We have reason to believe there is a connection between Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne.
LANDY: No, some people are convinced he's still a threat. I disagree but to find out I need to talk to
VOSEN: Hold on Nicky.
VOSEN: What are you doing? You know Bourne's probably listening.
VOSEN: How long till back up arrives.
NICKY: DIAL TONE as the line gets closed at the other end.
NICKY: They know you're here.
BOURNE: How long do I have?
NICKY: Three minutes.
DELTA DUDE: 2 minutes to safehouse.
NICKY: My car's outside. I know where Daniels is.
VOSEN: You "disagree" he's a threat? He just took out two more of my men. Not to mention his ultimatum to The only way this has a happy ending, Noah, is if we find a way to bring Bourne in voluntarily.
LANDY: The only way this has a happy ending, Noah, is if we find a way to bring Bourne in voluntarily.
VOSEN: He wants revenge, Pam. The only realistic way to deal with this is to eliminate the threat.
BOURNE: Okay, where is Daniels headed?
NICKY: 8 o'clock this morning, he wired $100,000. to a numbered bank account in Tangier.
BOURNE: Okay, Tangier is about 300 miles away, we can make the morning And then what?
NICKY: And then what?
NICKY: They're coming.
SPANISH POLICE: Manos Arriba! Manos Arriba!
VOSEN: Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne, effective
VOSEN: We lost Bourne.
KRAMER: You still think he's after Yeah. Nicky's just the means. But if we find Daniels, we'll find Bourne.
VOSEN: Yeah. Nicky's just the means. But if we find Daniels, we'll find Bourne.
KRAMER: Daniels knows way too much. Daniels knows everything. We can't let them meet.
VOSEN: I'll take care of it.
KRAMER: ( beat ) And fill Hirsch in. Just in
NICKY: What are you after, Jason? Why are you looking for Daniels?
BOURNE: Do you know who this is?
NICKY: That's Daniels. I don't know who that is.
BOURNE: I have to get back to the beginning.or I'll never be free of this.
NICKY: Who is he?
BOURNE: I think he started Treadstone. I remember meeting him. I remember the first day. Daniels brought me to him.
NICKY: What happened?
BOURNE: An initiation.I guess.
NICKY: Jason.that wasn't some one-off initiation. Daniels said they did that to you over and over again. That's how they.
BOURNE: Why are you helping me?
NICKY: It was difficult for me.with
BOURNE: NICKY'S face. Two SPANISH COPS enter the cafe.
VOSEN: ( to voiceprint mic ) Noah Vosen.
CRONIN: They tracked Daniels' passport to a hotel in Tangier. They're holding up a bank transfer he made to keep him in place while they move an asset in from
LANDY: Since when do you have authorization for lethal action against Daniels?
VOSEN: Since he cleaned out a Blackbriar safe and fled to Morocco!
LANDY: So grab him
VOSEN: I don't have the people on the ground to do that and I'm not going to risk that file falling into the wrong hands.
LANDY: What's going on? What's Daniels What's he got? He ran all of Blackbriar's operations in Southern Europe and North Africa.
VOSEN: What's he got? He ran all of Blackbriar's operations in Southern Europe and North Africa.
LANDY: I think the world's well aware we have a rendition and lethal action capability at this point, For Christ's sake, Pam, he's got our entire playbook. Names, dates, ghost sites, how we train our assets...
VOSEN: For Christ's sake, Pam, he's got our entire playbook. Names, dates, ghost sites, how we train our assets...
LANDY: You still don't have the authority to kill him.
VOSEN: Oh, yes I do, Pam.
VOSEN: That's what makes us special. No red tape. No more getting badguys in our sights and then watching them escape while we wait for some bureaucrat to issue the order.
LANDY: You just decide? No oversight. No checks and balances.
VOSEN: Come on, Pam, you've seen the raw intel. You know how real the threat is. We can't afford to have our hands tied like that They arrive and pass through CUSTOMS.
LANDY: It's Pamela Landy for him. Would you tell him it's urgent?
KRAMER: Tell her I'm unreachable.
VOSEN: Give me the subject's location.
TECHNICIAN #2: Subject is currently on foot and now entering Hotel Velazquez. 45 Route Commerce, Tangier.
VOSEN: Get an elevation and a floor plan, tic-tac-toe. Locate the room. Give the asset Daniels's location and the route between Daniel's hotel and the bank.

TECH: Sir, the asset is acquiring the
NICKY: His location's being blocked.
BOURNE: Now they found Daniels, do you know where he is?
NICKY: They'll get one of the operatives to terminate him.
BOURNE: Find out who.
BOURNE: Tell him you're going to meet him and that you have a new phone for If you stop Desh they'll just get someone else.
NICKY: If you stop Desh they'll just get someone else.
BOURNE: We're not going to stop him. We're going to follow him. He'll take us right to Daniels.
VOSEN: Find out why.
TECH: Sir, the asset is on the move, in route to subject.
TECH #1: Sir, the asset is back on course.
WILLS: Sir, we have an unauthorized breach. Someone with active system knowledge has penetrated out protocols. Information was passed to the asset at 14.11. The trace is confirmed and valid. It comes from a computer belonging to Nicky Parsons.
VOSEN: Where did the course deviation South to Rue Belgique. Stationery at Place de France.
VOSEN: That's where Parson's is.
VOSEN: When we're finished with Daniels send the asset after her. We find Parsons, we find Bourne.
VOSEN: Not now.
LANDY: Now. I want to know what's going Not now.
VOSEN: Not now.
LANDY: I'm asking on what basis you're continuing this operation.
VOSEN: On the basis that Nicky Parsons has compromised a covert operation. She is up to her neck in it.
LANDY: This is about Daniels, not Nicky!
VOSEN: She has betrayed us!
LANDY: You don't know the circumstances!
VOSEN: She's in league with Jason Bourne for Chrissake!
LANDY: You don't have the authority to kill her or Bourne!
VOSEN: Yes, I do Pam, it's right here and it's legal.
LANDY: She's one of our own. You start down this path.where does it LANDY turns and storms out.
VOSEN: It ends when we've won.
VOSEN: Notify the asset of the additional target.
BRYAN: Yes, sir.
VOSEN: Have the bank release the funds.
NICKY: Code in? Code in?
TECHY: We have a trace.
TECHY 2: Target heading north. Rue des Chretiens. Intercept ETA six Okay, that's it. Bar her cell. Tie it off.
VOSEN: Okay, that's it. Bar her cell. Tie it off.

DENIED': Really spooked now- looking around. Time to move. Dismantling the phone instinctively - scattering it's She starts to make her way out of the square.
TREADSTONE MINDSET: Checking the alleyways. Slipping out of sight. NICKY looking to the rooftops taking the advantage. Up some steps into a riad. Desh tracking her.
BOURNE: Alright, we need to be dead. You need to code that in.
VOSEN: I want to be sure. Have the station chief in Rabat confirm the deaths and do a sub-rosa check.And keep and eye on
CRONIN: The hub just got word Bourne and Nicky are dead.
LANDY: Not yet.
CRONIN: Not yet.
LANDY: Get me a copy of Bourne's personnel file.
BOURNE: I can see all their faces. But I can't remember any names..
BOURNE: I was starting to remember who they were.in India.with
NICKY: It's just going to lead to more killing, Jason. Are you sure you want that?
BOURNE: I've killed people and I've tried to apologize for what I've done, for what I am. None of it makes it better.
BOURNE: They're going to come for you again. You are going to have to run now.
BOURNE: It gets easier.
WILLS: Station chief in Rabat just called, they found a body.
VOSEN: 198DB INT. AIRPLANE DAY 198DB
CRONIN: Pam, You need to see this.
LANDY: They don't know.
CRONIN: No, if they knew Vosen wouldn't be in his office right now.
CRONIN: Maybe he's trying to communicate with you.
LANDY: Maybe we should communicate back. Because I think I know what Bourne's looking for.
LANDY: Pamela Landy.
BOURNE: I hear you're still looking for

LANDY: Why don't you come in, and we'll talk about it? Get some rest, Pam.
BOURNE: Get some rest, Pam.
VOSEN: ( rushing out ) He's got line of sight on us!
VOSEN: .This is a national security emergency. We have an imminent
VOSEN: Jason Bourne is alive and at large in New York City. We believe in one thousand yards of this building. I want an immediate twelve block lockdown of the area. Send a FLASH message to Langley, prep for local backup assistance.
WILLS: Landy just left the building. Check Landy's phone. Is she using it?
VOSEN: Check Landy's phone. Is she using it?
VOSEN: Nothing? No calls since Bourne
VOSEN: What the hell do you mean we can't read it?
TECH: Working on it
VOSEN: ( frustrated ) How do you know a text came if you can't read it ( to Wills ) Are we on Landy?
TECH: Six men. More on the way.
VOSEN: I want that goddamn text. We need to get out in front of her!

AGENT 3: Copy, we're going to take a left at 41st. One block, settle at the corner.
VOSEN: Get the map up.
AGENT 4: It's a bad place to pick, it's too exposed.
VOSEN: He wouldn't have chosen it if he didn't have a reason.
VOSEN: As soon as you have eyes on Landy, I want to know.
AGENT 3: Okay, here we go.
VOSEN: Copy that, I see her.
VOSEN: Noah Vosen.
VOSEN: How did you get this number?
VOSEN: No, I guess not. But if it's me you want to talk to maybe we can arrange a meet.
VOSEN: In my office.
BOURNE: We'd be having this conversation
VOSEN: This is a code ten abort, I want everybody back in the vehicles this is a code ten abort! Back to the vehicles immediately, back to CRI immediately.
WILLS: Bourne got into your safe!
