TITLES BEGIN: The barman, wiping down the counter, gives an occasional semi-furtive glance toward the far end of the bar. Other patrons chat near the bartender and also give occasional glances toward the far end of the bar. It is early evening happy hour and the clientele is well-heeled and sociable. A customer says something interrogative to the bartender, who looks down the bar and shrugs. REVERSE - CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT ( Notes the combination of the HIGH ANGLE and the tilt of Santa's head keep his face from being clearly revealed in this scene ). Sitting alone at the far end of the bar, given a wide berth by the other customers, a man ( WILLIE ) stares morosely into his drink. The drink is clearly not his first. He wears a red velvet suit and red velvet hat with a white pom-pom. He has shiny black boots with red velvet trim. His long white beard is not real and is in fact pulled down below his chin to facilitate drinking. It exposes heavy black Swaying slightly, he raises the drink to the vicinity of his lips. Once it gets close he must navigate it in with some effortful coordination. He takes a sip and sets the drink carefully back down. After another long, staring, morose beat, he starts weeping. It is loud, dolorous, and unself-conscious.
BAD SANTA: INT. SANTA ORIENTATION ROOM - DAY An upbeat woman TRAINER presides over a half-dozen SANTAS sitting at school desks. On the blackboard the Trainer is writing out the sixth "Santa Commandment".
TRAINER: ( as she writes ) Coax. a. smile. from. the ( turning to face them ) Remember, parents don't want photos where their child isn't smiling. Some children may not want to smile. It is your job to coax a smile out of them. A good line to remember is: "Santa thinks everybody should be happy. Can you smile for Santa?" A camera can only copy a child's smile it will take you to put it there.
TRAINER: If the child will not smile, the Photo Elf will go ahead and take the picture anyway. Now, it is a good Santa's job to smile as well I know with the big white beard your smile will be partially hidden, so you must learn to smile with your eyes. They show warmth and can be very expressive.
WILLIE'S FACE: as he finishes off the can of Coke to REVEAL: his eyes colder than those of a dead fish.
TRAINER: Remember you have been chosen for the starring role of Santa Claus. Your portrayal of this beloved character will have a major impact on every child you meet. Keep in mind at all times that to them, you aren't a man dressed up like Santa, you are Santa.
MOTHER: Hurry boys, we're gonna miss Santa! She drags them across the street toward the looming art-deco monolith that is the big-city department store.
OLDER CHILD: The older child is pointing at a prop gate with a candy-cane letter sign: TO SANTA'S WORKSHOP. He runs and Mom shoos her younger child to join him. The boys cross the threshold of the gate and their eyes filled with wonder. A winding path cuts through a flocked and candy-striped forest, past a workshop filled with mannequin-elves busily cobbling Christmas toys, and finally arriving at. Santa, seated on his throne like a scarlet Messiah. The younger child staggers forward to join the line of a hundred other leaky-nosed worshippers awaiting an audience. At the head of the line the next waiting child is escorted to Santa's chair by a smiling tiny man ( MARCUS ) dressed as an elf.
PHOTO ELF: ( dutifully reciting his spiel ) My, what a darling picture! Are you certain you only want the single? Additional photos come in handy as gifts for grandma and grandpa or a wonderful remembrance for friends.
MOM: That's all right, I'll just take the
SANTA: ( disinterested ) Uh-huh. yeah. done.
BRATTY KID: I saw you in another mall.
SANTA: ( not even looking at him ) Right. Good for you.
BRATTY KID: You're not really Santa. If you were Santa you could do magic.
SANTA: ( looks at him ) You want magic?
SANTA: There, I just made you disappear.
SANTA: .That it?
SANTA: .Thank fuckin' Christ.
SECURITY GUARD: Merry Christmas, Willie.
SANTA: Up your ass.
SECURITY GUARD: Have it your way, Willie.
SANTA: Don't tell me which way to have it.
WILLIE: Marcus sneers at him as he lumbers past:

KID: Santa here?
MARCUS: Oh jeez.
WILLIE: Is that your underwear?
KID: Part of it.
WILLIE: Where's the rest? Never mind. What do you want?
KID: I was thinking I wanted a purple stuffed elephant, not pink, but now I changed my mind.
WILLIE: Now I don't want an elephant at all. I want a gorilla named Davy for beating up the skateboard kids who pull on my underwear and he could take his orders from the talking walnut so it wouldn't be my bad thing.
KID: Now I don't want an elephant at all. I want a gorilla named Davy for beating up the skateboard kids who pull on my underwear and he could take his orders from the talking walnut so it wouldn't be my bad thing.
WILLIE: .You know when I was your age, I didn't need no fuckin' gorilla, and I wasn't any bigger than you. One day I came crying home to Dad because four kids had beat me up, and you know what he did?'
KID: He make it all better?
WILLIE: No. He kicked my ass. You know why?
KID: You went bathroom on Mommy's dishes?
WILLIE: What the fuck? No.
KID: He try to teach you not to cry and be a man.
WILLIE: Nope, it was because he was a mean, drunk son of a bitch. When he wasn't busy busting my ass, he was puttin' out cigarettes on my neck.
KID: The world's fuckin' unfair it don't give ya nothing. You can wish all you want but you gotta take what you need. Stand up for yourself. stop being such a pussy and kick those kids in the balls or something. Or don't, I don't give a shit. Just leave me the hell out of it.

GIN: Research, that's how. I'm a department store detective Sherlock, that's what I do. Seven cities in seven years. Pretty impressive. The stores change, your names change. You always get away clean. Yeah, pretty darn impressive. But let's face facts you all are a couple of half-bucket small-timers. Because of your physical attributes you've found a niche. I respect that. But you've also been caught. By me. So this is the way how we gonna do things. I don't want to take over, I don't even want to change your scam. Whatever you guys do, it works. All I want is a taste. When the deed is done, we part ways. I buy a ranch in Havasu, you take your little medicine show back on the road.
