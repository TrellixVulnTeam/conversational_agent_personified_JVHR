DIGNAN: Plus where's Huggie Bear?
ANTHONY: He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
DIGNAN: I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
ANTHONY: No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
DIGNAN: As part of his plan. I don't know See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
ANTHONY: As part of his plan. I don't know See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
DIGNAN: See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
ANTHONY: The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
DIGNAN: ( pause ) What does Starsky say?
ANTHONY: He says. This is he.
DIGNAN: This is he?
ANTHONY: No. This is he.
ANTHONY: Did you see what I meant about the Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
DIGNAN: Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
ANTHONY: That's true. But what if they change the locks?
DIGNAN: Would they do that?
ANTHONY: Who knows? That's why I filed it
ANTHONY: Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
DIGNAN: See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be Can I use your Tabasco?
WOMAN: Can I use your Tabasco?
ANTHONY: Anthony hands her a bottle of Tabasco off the counter. She walks away. Down the counter.
ANTHONY: You don't see many women who like
ANTHONY: She's really kind of hot.
DIGNAN: ( looks back at her, nods ) She's an attractive older woman.
BOB: Well, what do you think?
DIGNAN: I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
BOB: I'm not allowed to drive those.
DIGNAN: Not even for emergencies?
BOB: ( a little angry ) I thought your parents were in Italy.
DIGNAN: I thought your parents were in Italy.
BOB: They are.
DIGNAN: So who's going to know?
BOB: My brother.
ANTHONY: Future Man.
BOB: Futute Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
ANTHONY: Futute Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
DIGNAN: He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
BOB: That never would of
DIGNAN: Let's cut the bullshit.
ANTHONY: It's got a V-8, Dignan.
DIGNAN: What do you think the cops have?
BOB: If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
DIGNAN: What are you talking about, Bob?
BOB: Can you use a coaster.
ANTHONY: Did you ever steal a car bdfore?
BOB: Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T-Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to You stole a Trans-Am.
DIGNAN: You stole a Trans-Am.
BOB: Yes. I did.
DIGNAN: OK, Bob.
BOB: It's true, Dignan.
DIGNAN: Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
BOB: ( thinks for a minute ) I'll just drive my car.
DIGNAN: Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
ANTHONY: But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
DIGNAN: I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
DIGNAN: Your ball.
ANTHONY: I told you not to take the earrings.
DIGNAN: You got another ball.
DIGNAN: I'm playing your game.
ANTHONY: The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
DIGNAN: Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
ANTHONY: That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
DIGNAN: Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
ANTHONY: Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
ANTHONY: Dignan turns and starts walking the other way.
ANTHONY: Where are you going?
DIGNAN: I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
ANTHONY: How was I ridiculing you?
DIGNAN: You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
ANTHONY: That's not what I meant, Dignan.
DIGNAN: Did you see that?
ANTHONY: Yeah, I saw it.
DIGNAN: I'm lookout.
ANTHONY: Dignan, it's got an alarm.
DIGNAN: I don't think so. Just reach on in.
ANTHONY: That sets it off.
DIGNAN: No, just do it real quick. I'll meet you down there.
ANTHONY: It had an alarm.
DIGNAN: Yeah, I heard that.
ANTHONY: ( counting the money ) Five, seven, eight dollars.
DIGNAN: ( taking the wallet ) Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
ANTHONY: Eight dollars.
DIGNAN: That's not bad.
ANTHONY: What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the
BOB: Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
DIGNAN: How much could you grow? As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
BOB: As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
DIGNAN: Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
BOB: You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
ANTHONY: In your backyard? How do you protect them?
BOB: It's private property. Plus I have Hector woudn't do anything.
ANTHONY: Hector woudn't do anything.
BOB: But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
DIGNAN: If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
BOB: Good question.
BOB: Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
DIGNAN: You're paranoid, Bob.
BOB: Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
ANTHONY: Could you grow cinnamon?
BOB: I don't know. Sure, I guess.
ANTHONY: You could make your own cinnamon
BOB: Are you a fag?
LITTLE RICHARD: You're the faggot.
BOB: Little Richard. I don't believe it. They'll let anybody in this place. Sit down.
BOB: Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
LITTLE RICHARD: ( smiling ) I don't know about that.
BOB: Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
LITTLE RICHARD: It seemed like a good idea at the The one and only Little Richard.
BOB: The one and only Little Richard.
DIGNAN: Are you named after THE Little Ha! Ha! Ha! Why don't you stick it up your ass. Great group of guys you're hanging out with.
LITTLE RICHARD: ( stares at Dignan ) Ha! Ha! Ha! Why don't you stick it up your ass. Great group of guys you're hanging out with.
DIGNAN: What was that all about?
BOB: I can't believe you said that.
DIGNAN: What did I say?
BOB: I told you he's crazy.
ANTHONY: But he didn't say anything.
DIGNAN: Hang on a second.
DIGNAN: Little Richard. Wait a second. Hang on. I didn't mean to
ANTHONY: Let them fight.
BOB: Let them fight.
DIGNAN: ( calling out )
ANTHONY: OK. Break it up. Break it up.
DIGNAN: I separated my shoulder.
ANTHONY: OK. Hang on.
DIGNAN: Just pull straight up.
ANTHONY: Is it back in?
DIGNAN: ( moving arm slowly ) OK, man. Let's go.
GUY #1: OK, man. Let's go.
DIGNAN: No. I'm not fighting anymore.
ANTHONY: His shoulder went out, man. It's You guys better get out of here.
GUY #2: You guys better get out of here.
LITTLE RICHARD: Bob takes off.
DIGNAN: The guy is fucking insane.
BOB: I warned you, Dignan.
DIGNAN: You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
BOB: No, I was saying crazy like a I know that now. He's a fucking Well, don't blame me. I told you.
DIGNAN: I know that now. He's a fucking Well, don't blame me. I told you.
BOB: Well, don't blame me. I told you.
DIGNAN: I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
DIGNAN: Loop around real fast.
ANTHONY: Just turn right here.
DIGNAN: Where'd she go?
BOB: Maybe she turned.
ANTHONY: There she is.
ANTHONY: Bob, don't be so obvious.
DIGNAN: I think we might of scared her.
BOB: Let's just go.
DIGNAN: You blew it, Bob.
TEMPLE: A gun is a firearm. A pistol is a firearm. But anything you hold in your hand is a weapon. A knife. A wrench. A ballpoint pen.
ANTHONY: A ballpoiht pen?
TEMPLE: Anyone who tells you a ballpoint pen is not a weapon needs intensive psychiatric treatment. You can stick them in the esophagus. You give them a ballpoint tracheotomy.
DIGNAN: OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be
ANTHONY: You think we're going to be chased?
DIGNAN: That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say
BOB: ( quietly ) I'm going to take a look at this.
DIGNAN: ( puts hand on gun ) Hang on This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
BOB: ( nods ) That's my responsibility.
DIGNAN: That's your domain.
BOB: Anthony is making a little man out of a scrap of paper.
DIGNAN: Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
ANTHONY: ( looks up ) Nothing. Go ahead.
BOB: ( to himself ) How many bullets can that hold?
DIGNAN: I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
BOB: I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
DIGNAN: ( screaming ) What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
BOB: I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
DIGNAN: Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
ANTHONY: ( pulling away ) No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
BOB: ( quietly ) I paid for it.
DIGNAN: God DAMMIT.
DIGNAN: You two just don't give a shit, do
ANTHONY: Dignan, calm down.
DIGNAN: ( turns back, screaming ) You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
ANTHONY: Dignan! Stop!
ANTHONY: Calm down. Take a deep breath.
DIGNAN: ( pause ) You're right. You're right.
FUTURE MAN: What are you guys doing?
ANTHONY: Nothing. We're just
FUTURE MAN: You seen my brother?
DIGNAN: He's inside.
GIRLFRIEND: ( smiles )
FUTURE MAN: Goddammit, Bob! Get your shit
FUTURE MAN: What are you guys up to tonight?
ANTHONY: Nothing much.
DIGNAN: Just hanging around.
GIRLFRIEND: She follows Future Man. Anthony and Dignan watch them walk away. Bob comes back out with some drinks. He looks shaken.
DIGNAN: What'd Future Man want?
BOB: He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
DIGNAN: Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
BOB: Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
ANTHONY: The only nut with a gun is going to be Dignan.
DIGNAN: ( whispering, very serious ) You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
BOB: He electrocuted someone?
DIGNAN: It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
BOB: His name was Swifty?
DIGNAN: Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
BOB: That's too bad.
DIGNAN: ( nods ) You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
BOB: What are you doing?
DIGNAN: I'm putting a piece of tape on my
DIGNAN: ( immediately, dead serious ) Let's get lucky.
ANTHONY: I left my sweater inside.
ANTHONY: Do you have a lost and found?
EMPLOYEE: We're closed.
ANTHONY: I left my sweater in there.
EMPLOYEE: Oh. I see. Come on in.
EMPLOYEE: We're closed, sir.
DIGNAN: Where's that guy going?
EMPLOYEE: He left his sweater.
DIGNAN: Well, I left some money in there.
EMPLOYEE: ( pulls out the gun ) In the cash relister. Step away from the door.
DIGNAN: ( pulls out the gun ) In the cash relister. Step away from the door.
ANTHONY: Where's the manager?
DIGNAN: Where's the other stocker?
ANTHONY: There's another stocker, right?
DIGNAN: We know there's another stocker.
EMPLOYEE: Dignan points the gun at the employee.
DIGNAN: Where is he? Where is Rob?
EMPLOYEE: I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
DIGNAN: You got that?
ANTHONY: Sure. Literature. The classics.
ANTHONY: Is that the manager?
DIGNAN: ( to manager ) Unlock that door. ( to Anthony ) Check the aisles.
ANTHONY: ( looks up, a little puzzled ) Why aren't you in literature?
ROB: ( looks up, a little puzzled ) Why aren't you in literature?
ANTHONY: Why aren't you in literature?
ROB: ( hesitates ) It's all full up.
DIGNAN: Open it up.
DIGNAN: OK. Open the other. Let's go.
DIGNAN: Put it in one of those.
DIGNAN: A bigger one, you idiot.
MANAGER: ( glares at Dignan ) Don't call me an idiot, you punk.
DIGNAN: I'm sorry. But that bag's too small.
DIGNAN: OK, guys. Just.Sit tight.
DIGNAN: Go. Go. Drive slow.
BOB: What happened?
DIGNAN: Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
BOB: This is natural.
DIGNAN: ( looks at speedometer ) That's good. Keep it at forty.
BOB: Did we get it?
DIGNAN: Be cool, Bob. Be cool. Make that light.
ANTHONY: Holy shit.
DIGNAN: We got it. We got it.
BOB: How much is there?
DIGNAN: Don't count it.
BOB: Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a No. I was calm.
DIGNAN: No. I was calm.
ANTHONY: What about what that guy said?
DIGNAN: Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
BOB: Are you serious?
ANTHONY: Yeah. He said that.
DIGNAN: I swear to God. In a very quiet Like he meant it.
ANTHONY: Like he meant it.
DIGNAN: Like he would find Dignan. One day.
ANTHONY: Like he would find Dignan. One day.
DIGNAN: Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
BOB: You really think he'll remember you?
DIGNAN: ( smiles ) No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
BOB: See you.
ANTHONY: See you, Bob.
DIGNAN: Hang on, Bob.
DIGNAN: That was really good driving. Seriously. I mean it.
DIGNAN: We'll see you later, Bob. Good What's wrong with him?
DIGNAN: What's wrong with him?
ANTHONY: What do you think?
DIGNAN: Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
ANTHONY: He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
DIGNAN: I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got
ANTHONY: Don't even say it, man.
DIGNAN: Bob, will you please listen?
BOB: I don't want to talk about it. Look, I admit I was wrong for not telling you before the robbery that your share wouldn't be as equal as ours. But the fact remains me and Anthony were much more exposed to I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember That's true. That would give me Bob, I've got nightmares.
DIGNAN: Look, I admit I was wrong for not telling you before the robbery that your share wouldn't be as equal as ours. But the fact remains me and Anthony were much more exposed to I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember That's true. That would give me Bob, I've got nightmares.
DIGNAN: I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember That's true. That would give me Bob, I've got nightmares.
BOB: ( smiles slightly, keeps playing ) That's true. That would give me Bob, I've got nightmares.
DIGNAN: Bob, I've got nightmares.
BOB: You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
ANTHONY: What was that?
DIGNAN: They hear breaking glass somewhere as they follow Anthony onto the patio. A voice yells out.
VOICE: What's going on?
ANTHONY: What's going on?
BOB: Phil. What happened?
PHIL: ( hysterical ) Motherfucker. I'll kill him.
BOB: ( looks around, suddenly concerned )
PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND: I've called the police. Oh, my God,
PHIL: Don't touch me! I swear to God I'll get that guy.
PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND: I know you will, Phil. There was nothing you could do. All you had was a golf club.
ANTHONY: You're bleeding, man. Sit down.
NEIGHBOR: What happened?
PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND: Some black man beat Phil up.
PHIL: He didn't beat me up. He attacked me.
PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND: He took two hundred dollars.
ANTHONY: ( to Phil ) Tilt your head back.
DIGNAN: He was probably on drugs.
OFFICER: They usually are. As soon as I opened the door I saw him. A black guy. Looking through my dad's tool box. I wanted to trap this guy. So I closed the garage And that's when he hit you?
PHIL: As soon as I opened the door I saw him. A black guy. Looking through my dad's tool box. I wanted to trap this guy. So I closed the garage And that's when he hit you?
COP: And that's when he hit you?
PHIL: ( looking up to sky and concentrating ) He struck me. I fell down. He took my wallet. Then he opened the garage door and ran away.
COP: How'd the window break?
PHIL: I hit it with the golf club.
DIGNAN: How long do you have to go?
COP: 26 weeks.
DIGNAN: And what does that cover?
COP: Social issues. Crime prevention.
DIGNAN: Hand to hand combat?
COP: Ground defense.
DIGNAN: Did you hear that?
OFFICER: Anthony's looking up into the treetops.
DIGNAN: Anthony's looking up into the treetops.
BOB: What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
ANTHONY: There's a million places to hide around here.
BOB: Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the I hope not.
ANTHONY: I hope not.
BOB: Phil probably provoked him. Where's he going?
DIGNAN: No, it was a rustling sound.
BOB'S VOICE: The dog. Look out for the dog.
OFFICER: Is this dog going to bite?
DIGNAN: No. Shit no.
DIGNAN: See? I don't know what he's talking
ANTHONY: Where you going?
BOB: As Bob walks away he is looking back, past Anthony, toward the backyard.
ANTHONY: What's wrong?
DIGNAN: He probably went into the next yard. Shine the light over here.
DIGNAN: Those are.
OFFICER: Halt! Sir!
OFFICER: Bill! He's running!
DIGNAN: The prowler! That way!
DIGNAN: Way to go, Bob!
BOB: I told you they were there.
DIGNAN: ( about to explode ) So it's my fault?
ANTHONY: Be quiet.
DIGNAN: In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? There were more than that.
BOB: There were more than that.
ANTHONY: Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
BOB: I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
ANTHONY: Nobody does.
DIGNAN: Obviously. That's why we go on the road. The thing about cops is they have short attention spans.
DIGNAN: Can I get that credit card from you?
ANTHONY: ( pause ) I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
DIGNAN: Why not?
ANTHONY: Because my mom gets the bill.
DIGNAN: She's not going to notice, Anthony.
ANTHONY: I don't want to use it.
DIGNAN: ( pause ) Well, then cut it in half.
ANTHONY: I keep it for emergencies.
DIGNAN: Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that.
ANTHONY: Here's mine right here. See?
DIGNAN: See if mine are in there.
ANTHONY: ( looks at Dignan's shoes ) Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
DIGNAN: Yes, they are.
ANTHONY: Look at the treads on those.
DIGNAN: What about them?
ANTHONY: They obviously weren't designed for Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
DIGNAN: Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
BOB: Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the OK, Dad.
ANTHONY: OK, Dad.
DIGNAN: Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
ANTHONY: You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan. In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
DIGNAN: That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
ANTHONY: Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
DIGNAN: You were spoiled rotten.
BOB: Enough. Jesus Christ.
ANTHONY: ( yelling ) You want to say it, Bob?
ANTHONY: I'll just say it.
DIGNAN: I'll say it.
ANTHONY: OK. Go ahead.
DIGNAN: On your marks. Get set go.
DIGNAN: ( points at Anthony ) You owe me fifty bucks.
ANTHONY: Anthony won.
BOB: Anthony won.
DIGNAN: Bob wasn't even looking.
GIRL: Was that shirt made from a towel?
DIGNAN: ( seeing his reaction ) It's just terrycloth, isn't it?
GIRL: ( seeing his reaction ) It's just terrycloth, isn't it?
DIGNAN: Yeah. I think so.
ANTHONY: Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
DIGNAN: No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
ANTHONY: It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
DIGNAN: Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
ANTHONY: I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
DIGNAN: Right.. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
ANTHONY: It's not a plan. It's just
DIGNAN: Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
ANTHONY: Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
DIGNAN: There's a car stopped in front of them. A couple of girls are standing beside it, talking to the driver. Bob can't get Dignan leans over and holds down the horn for about five seconds. The guy in the car sticks hi s hand out the window and shoots the finger at them. Dignan sounds dead serious:
DIGNAN: What the fuck is this?
DIGNAN: Ram him, Bob.
DIGNAN: Hit him! Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
DIGNAN: Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
BOB: He wouldn't move.
BOB: Is he chasing us?
DIGNAN: I don't know.
ANTHONY: Speed up, Bob.
BOB: You think he got my license plates?
ANTHONY: He looked too shaken-up.
DIGNAN: I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
BOB: It's registered in my mother's name.
DIGNAN: ( shakes his head ) What the fuck possessed you?
BOB: You're the one who kept saying ram
DIGNAN: I meant tap him. As a warning.
ANTHONY: Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
DIGNAN: Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
ANTHONY: No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not? Well, Bob, Samson has decided that his hair is more important than our My friend, that is a reckless decision! Let's go, Bob.
DIGNAN: Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not? Well, Bob, Samson has decided that his hair is more important than our My friend, that is a reckless decision! Let's go, Bob.
DIGNAN: Well, Bob, Samson has decided that his hair is more important than our My friend, that is a reckless decision! Let's go, Bob.
DIGNAN: Bob. Are you coming?
BOB: See you in a little while.
ANTHONY: See you, Bob.
ANTHONY: No, it's OK. Come on in.
ANTHONY: It's hot out, isn't it? Yeah. This is a nice little town. So, what, do you do all these rooms yourself? Or what? I'm Anthony.
ANTHONY: What's your name?
MAID: She nods.
ANTHONY: She nods.
ANTHONY: Let me give you a hand with that.
ANTHONY: How do you say nineteen?
INEZ: Dies y nueve.
ANTHONY: Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
ANTHONY: Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
INEZ: ( laughs ) It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
ANTHONY: It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
ANTHONY: People think because they're in a hotel they can act like a slob. It's bad manners.
ANTHONY: Were you born in Mexico?
INEZ: Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
ANTHONY: Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
INEZ: Scuse me.
ANTHONY: These towels are still warm.
ANTHONY: I guess from the dryer.
ANTHONY: I've never met anybody from Cuba
INEZ: A WOMAN about thirty-five years old opens the door.
WOMAN: We're just checking out.
HUSBAND: Anthony follows Inez into the bathroom. The husband looks at his wife.
ANTHONY: Anthony follows Inez into the bathroom. The husband looks at his wife.
DIGNAN: You can go first, Bob.
BOB: My brother's in jail.
DIGNAN: What are you talking about?
BOB: The weed.
DIGNAN: But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
BOB: They said he's a drug dealer.
DIGNAN: Those assholes. We got rapes. Murders. Violent crimes every second. And this is what they come up with. They're just fucking him because he's from a prominent family.
DIGNAN: I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
BOB: Well, the marijuana crop is a good That could be anybody's.
DIGNAN: That could be anybody's.
BOB: They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
DIGNAN: Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
BOB: The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
DIGNAN: So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
BOB: ( pause ) I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
DIGNAN: How long has he been in there?
BOB: I don't know.
DIGNAN: Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
BOB: We'll have to see when we get back.
DIGNAN: What do you mean get back?
BOB: ( pause ) Well, obviously, we got to go back.
DIGNAN: Bob, that makes no sense.
BOB: Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
DIGNAN: This could be a trap.
BOB: Come on, Dignan.
DIGNAN: Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
BOB: I'm going back.
DIGNAN: ( louder ) Not in that car you're not.
BOB: Watch me.
DIGNAN: Good luck, since I got the keys.
BOB: Give me the keys, Dignan.
DIGNAN: I can't do that, Bob.
BOB: Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get Don't threaten me, Bob.
DIGNAN: Don't threaten me, Bob.
BOB: Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God
DIGNAN: Look, Bob. I understand your loyalty. You're a good person. But right now you're not using your best judgement.
DIGNAN: Future Man would not want you to go to jail I promise you. Just get in the car and we'll talk about it.
DIGNAN: Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
BOB: His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
DIGNAN: I know it's not.
BOB: You don't even know his name.
DIGNAN: Yes, I do.
BOB: What is it?
DIGNAN: Just get in the car, Bob.
BOB: What's his name?
DIGNAN: OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
BOB: It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
DIGNAN: That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
DIGNAN: You're going to ride in the back?
DIGNAN: Come on, Bob. Get in front.
DIGNAN: You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
BOB: Let's go.
DIGNAN: Hi. How's it going.
ANTHONY: I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
DIGNAN: No. We didn't. We're making banana daqueris.
ANTHONY: We're making banana daqueris.
ANTHONY: This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
DIGNAN: Inez, this is
ANTHONY: Inez, this is
DIGNAN: ( pointing to Bob ) And this is my associate Cornelius.
DIGNAN: May I have a word with you, please?
ANTHONY: EXT. MOTEL HALLWAY. NIGHT Outside the room. Dignan closes the door. There's three housekeeping carts in the hall.
DIGNAN: What the fuck is going on here?
ANTHONY: What. What's the matter?
DIGNAN: Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
ANTHONY: No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
DIGNAN: They don't?
ANTHONY: No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
DIGNAN: Which one was that?
ANTHONY: On the left.
ANTHONY: She's from Cuba.
DIGNAN: No kidding.
BOB: ( closes the door ) Anthony. Bad news.
DIGNAN: ( closes the door ) Anthony. Bad news.
ANTHONY: How long are they going to hold him?
BOB: I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
DIGNAN: He needs to hire an attorney.
ANTHONY: No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
BOB: Anthony, I
ANTHONY: And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
DIGNAN: Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
ANTHONY: As long as he gets out OK.
DIGNAN: Obviously. That's a given.
ANTHONY: Is that OK?
BOB: Is that OK?
ANTHONY: Is that OK?
BOB: ( shrugs ) Yeah. I guess so.
DIGNAN: See, now we've got a plan.
ANTHONY: Don't worry about it, Bob.
INEZ: Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
ANTHONY: ( passionate ) God, yes. Like silk.
ANTHONY: ( starts laughing ) Like silk?
INEZ: Like silk?
ANTHONY: God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
DIGNAN: No lifeguard on duty. Swim at your own risk.
DIGNAN: You know, I did save Anthony from drowning once, Inez. Tell her,
DIGNAN: See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
ANTHONY: This was in fourth grade.
DIGNAN: Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
ANTHONY: After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
DIGNAN: They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
ANTHONY: But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
DIGNAN: ( nodding, whisper voice ) Yes.It's true.
DIGNAN: Son of a bitch.
DIGNAN: He's gone. He stole the car.
ANTHONY: Where was it parked?
DIGNAN: Right here.
DIGNAN: That coward. Son of a bitch.
ANTHONY: Maybe he just went to the store.
DIGNAN: He took his stuff. He's gone. I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any He went back for his brother.
ANTHONY: He went back for his brother.
DIGNAN: We said 48 hours.
ANTHONY: That's a long time to be in jail.
DIGNAN: We'll get him. Don't worry about that. We'll go back. We'll find him. And we'll blow up his car. Or do something. I promise you.
DIGNAN: I mean, let's face it. Bob was dead weight. We're a lot better off without him. But who could expect it? Just like that. Steals the fucking car. What kind of person pulls that
ANTHONY: Bob didn't steal the car. He told me he was going. He had to go help his brother.
DIGNAN: When'd he tell you?
ANTHONY: This morning.
DIGNAN: Where was I?
ANTHONY: You were asleep.
DIGNAN: He told you and you let him do it.
ANTHONY: He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
DIGNAN: ( hesitates ) If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by Well, I didn't do it, did I?
ANTHONY: Well, I didn't do it, did I?
DIGNAN: So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real suprised, that was just an act. You were Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
ANTHONY: Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
DIGNAN: I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
ANTHONY: If you say so.
DIGNAN: If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
ANTHONY: I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
DIGNAN: Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
ANTHONY: You want to look at the map?
ANTHONY: See. Here's where we are. I didn't know he had it in him. I guess you could say the child has become the father of the man.
DIGNAN: I didn't know he had it in him. I guess you could say the child has become the father of the man.
ANTHONY: We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
DIGNAN: No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you
ANTHONY: Why don't you come with us.
DIGNAN: Dignan gets out of the pool.
MAN: Hello, my friend. You in the Army, No. I just have short hair.
DIGNAN: No. I just have short hair.
MAN: Is that your chiquita?
DIGNAN: No, my friend knows her.
MAN: She Chicano, yes?
MAN: You like Chicanos?
DIGNAN: He says something in fast Spanish to the people at his table and they smile.
MAN: Play pool? For one cerveza.
MAN: ( smiling ) You a good pool player.
DIGNAN: Got a little lucky.
MAN: Where's your friend? He go with the
DIGNAN: I don't know.
MAN: She is a good looking woman.
DIGNAN: Guess I'll get another Tecate.
MAN: Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
DIGNAN: Fight. You know.
MAN: Fight. You know.
DIGNAN: No. Just pool.
MAN: You Hoto?
DIGNAN: ( pulls away ) Fuck you. You a Hoto.
MAN: ( smiles ) No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
DIGNAN: INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT The bathroom is very small with one bare light bulb. Dignan stands at the urinal, muttering to himself. The door opens and Dignan turns around just in time to see the Mexican man throw a hard punch. He hits Dignan in the stomach, punches him in the face. Dignan goes down hard. The guy kicks him and curses in Spanish.
MAN: Pinche cabrone. Puta madre.
ANTHONY: I can't believe he just jumped you.
DIGNAN: Can you hand me those french fries.
ANTHONY: I wish I'd been there.
DIGNAN: Would of been nice.
ANTHONY: Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
DIGNAN: I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
ANTHONY: ( pause ) We need a car.
DIGNAN: I have an idea for that.
ANTHONY: Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she? Doesn't she?
DIGNAN: Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she? Doesn't she?
ANTHONY: I don't think we can do that.
DIGNAN: I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
ANTHONY: What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
DIGNAN: She doesn't need to know.
ANTHONY: ( pause ) I don't know, Dignan. I just
DIGNAN: Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
ANTHONY: No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better
DIGNAN: No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better
ANTHONY: Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
DIGNAN: Then you better think of something.
INEZ: How are you, Jerry?
DIGNAN: ( staring at TV ) I feel great, Inez.
ANTHONY: ( kisses her ) I'll see you later.
ANTHONY: I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
DIGNAN: You don't know how to hotwire.
ANTHONY: Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
DIGNAN: Bob taught you how to get No, I'm serious. He made me a
ANTHONY: No, I'm serious. He made me a
DIGNAN: What'd you say to Inez?
DIGNAN: "I'll come back for you. I love you, Inez."
DIGNAN: "I'm going to take you away from all this windexing and making beds."
ANTHONY: Man, I don't know anything about
DIGNAN: You really know how to pick them. I think we better go home.
ANTHONY: I think we better go home.
DIGNAN: Don't panic, Anthony.
ANTHONY: I'm not. But there's
DIGNAN: You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to
ANTHONY: Our money situation is not good.
DIGNAN: ( clapping him on the back ) You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred
ANTHONY: We've got sixteen dollars.
DIGNAN: That's not correct.
DIGNAN: Give it to me.
DIGNAN: Sixteen dollars.
ANTHONY: I know.
DIGNAN: Where's the rest?
ANTHONY: I had to give some to Inez.
DIGNAN: How much?
ANTHONY: Dignan frowns slightly. Pause. He screams:
DIGNAN: Pause. Dignan runs at the car and kicks the door as hard as he can. It makes a big dent. He runs down the shoulder and grabs a big rock. He runs at the car and smashes the rock through the windshield. He stands still. He turns to Anthony. He walks back over to him, yelling.
DIGNAN: You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your She needed it.
ANTHONY: She needed it.
DIGNAN: A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
ANTHONY: Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
DIGNAN: That's what she is!
ANTHONY: I know that. But
DIGNAN: You're in love with the fucking Shut up!
ANTHONY: Shut up!
DIGNAN: What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the
ANTHONY: ( pause ) Now listen to me.
ANTHONY: Bob, where you going?
BOB: I'm not playing any more golf.
ANTHONY: Why not?
BOB: Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
ANTHONY: You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
BOB: You think I'm improving?
ANTHONY: ( pause ) Yes. You just got to stick with it.
BOB: You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
ANTHONY: No, I don't mind.
BOB: I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
ANTHONY: Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my
ANTHONY: Even the school custodian Swifty thought it was great. He kept laughing and shaking his head the whole time he tried to disconnect the generator. And then suddenly total silence except for Swifty hanging off the generator with his leg stuck to it being electrocuted.
ANTHONY: Actually he died of a heart attack brought on by the shock. He was an older guy.
ANTHONY: I felt terrible. I'd known Swifty since first grade. He was Dignan's medicine man for Indian Guides. They called each other Rattlesnake and Killer Whale. Whenever Dignan came to visit me he would act like he and Swifty weren't that good of friends, but that was just to make me feel better. The whole rest of the school had turned against me.
ANTHONY: At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty Sixty days?
BOB: Sixty days?
ANTHONY: Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
BOB: Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
ANTHONY: Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
ANTHONY: ( pause ) It's a panther.
FUTURE MAN: How's that 700 bucks coming?
BOB: I'm working on it.
FUTURE MAN: Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
ANTHONY: I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
BOB: Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
ANTHONY: ( pause ) Were you adopted, Bob?
BOB: Why do you say that?
ANTHONY: Well, because you guys don't look No. I wasn't adopted.
BOB: No. I wasn't adopted.
ANTHONY: Was Future Man adopted?
BOB: Jesus Christ! No.
DIGNAN: There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
APPLEJACK: Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
DIGNAN: Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
APPLEJACK: That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
DIGNAN: We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about Is that Buckethead?
APPLEJACK: Is that Buckethead?
DIGNAN: Get down.
APPLEJACK: Is that him?
DIGNAN: Wait a second.
DIGNAN: That's Anthony.
APPLEJACK: That's your friend Anthony?
DIGNAN: What's he doing here?
APPLEJACK: What's he doing here?
DIGNAN: Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
DIGNAN: Don't get too close.
DIGNAN: Stop. He saw us.
DIGNAN: Wait. Did he see us?
APPLEJACK: We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
DIGNAN: Speed up.
DIGNAN: Anthony looks back. He stops running.
DIGNAN: Wait up. Where you going?
DIGNAN: Where you going?
ANTHONY: Just walking Hector.
ANTHONY: When'd you get back?
DIGNAN: Ah. Couple days ago. You want to shake hands.
DIGNAN: ( under his breath ) You want to shake hands.
ANTHONY: Who's in the car?
DIGNAN: That's Applejack. You want to meet
ANTHONY: They walk to the car.
DIGNAN: This is Applejack.
ANTHONY: Nice to meet you, Applejack.
APPLEJACK: You're Anthony?
ANTHONY: I hear you're a good thief.
APPLEJACK: I hear you're a good thief.
APPLEJACK: I'm just sitting at this bar drinking my drink when this fine chick walks by. She was a living doll. And the big motherfucker who came in with her sees me looking, when he walks by he steps on my foot. Doesn't say shit. Just takes a seat with his lady. Well, I holler out to him, If I was as big as you, ain't no way in the hell you'd of stepped on my foot like that. He just laughed. He says, Little man, take your foot and put it in your pocket. I said, No, how about I take my foot and I stick it up your ass? Man, we went to war right there. I hit him so hard I knocked his nuts in his watchpocket. But this motherfucker wouldn't go down. Then all the sudden, out of nowhere, Dignan came up behind him and smashed a bottle on his head. And that big old boy went down. That's how I met Dignan. Good cat to have on your side. He'll go to war with you. He don't give a fuck.
DIGNAN: Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker war.
ANTHONY: You really hit a guy with a bottle?
DIGNAN: Pretty much. He kind of fell into me. But wait a second.
DIGNAN: I want you to look at this.
ANTHONY: What is it?
DIGNAN: It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
ANTHONY: What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
DIGNAN: Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
ANTHONY: Who's Mr. Henry?
DIGNAN: You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
APPLEJACK: Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
ANTHONY: ( shakes his head ) S. Cooper Trust,in San Francisco?
APPLEJACK: S. Cooper Trust,in San Francisco?
ANTHONY: Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
DIGNAN: Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
APPLEJACK: Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
ANTHONY: What exactly is this place? Freezers?
DIGNAN: Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
APPLEJACK: Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
ANTHONY: Just a nickname.
DIGNAN: Just a nickname.
ANTHONY: What time did he say to be here?
DIGNAN: Right now.
APPLEJACK: I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
ANTHONY: What do you mean?
APPLEJACK: Feel this.
ANTHONY: ( whistles ) You could give somebody a concussion.
DIGNAN: Let me feel that.
DIGNAN: ( grabbing his hand ) Ow. Shit.
MAN: How's the weather down there?
DIGNAN: ( pause ) Mr. Henry?
MAN: Come on in!
DIGNAN: It's locked.
MAN: No, it's not.
MR. HENRY: Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack. Who are you?
DIGNAN: This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
MR. HENRY: This is no good.
MR. HENRY: This is no good, bringing him here. What are you thinking? What the shit, man? Are you crazy?
MR. HENRY: I'm pulling your leg. Abe Henry. This is my business manager, Rowboat.
MR. HENRY: This is my business manager, Rowboat.
ANTHONY: Nice to meet you.
MR. HENRY: That's a sharp jacket.
ANTHONY: INT. WAREHOUSE. DAY The second floor of the warehouse is one huge room painted all white. Mr. Henry and Anthony are playing ping-pong. Dignan watches. Rowboat-and Applejack are on the far side of the room playing chess.
ANTHONY: It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
MR. HENRY: It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
MR. HENRY: You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
ANTHONY: Mr. Henry serves. Anthony returns. Mr. Henry suddenly fires a scorching shot down the line. Anthony watches it click past him. He looks to Mr. Henry.
ANTHONY: Nice shot.
MR. HENRY: Is he in?
DIGNAN: I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
ANTHONY: Yeah, I'm in.
MR. HENRY: OK, kid. Let's go talk about cops and robbers.
MR. HENRY: Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success? The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
ANTHONY: What do you mean grammar?
DIGNAN: What do you mean grammar?
MR. HENRY: The basic grammatical rules of You mean like techniques?
ANTHONY: You mean like techniques?
MR. HENRY: ( nods ) Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
DIGNAN: ( pause ) Yes, I do.
MR. HENRY: On the other hand you got to have the right equipment. I don't care if you're Harry Houdini. You can't pick a lock without a hairpin.
ANTHONY: I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
MR. HENRY: Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
DIGNAN: The grammar?
MR. HENRY: Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
DIGNAN: Oh, yeah.
MR. HENRY: You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
ANTHONY: You mean a safecracker?
MR. HENRY: Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
DIGNAN: Is he good?
MR. HENRY: He's damn good.
DIGNAN: So what do you think of the plan, Mr. Kumar?
DIGNAN: We'd love to have you on the team. What is that? An orchid?
ANTHONY: What is that? An orchid?
KUMAR: Good plan.
DIGNAN: What do you think?
ANTHONY: ( nods ) He seems pretty good.
BOB: Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
DIGNAN: Not bad.
BOB: Come on in. What you been up to?
DIGNAN: Not a whole lot, Bob.
BOB: It's too bad about what happened on the road.
DIGNAN: Yeah. It is.
ANTHONY: Let's not even talk about it.
BOB: It was stupid.
DIGNAN: Right. It was extremely stupid.
BOB: I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
DIGNAN: I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
BOB: Man, I don't want to go into this.
ANTHONY: Yeah. Let's keep it
BOB: Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
DIGNAN: You said 48 hours!
BOB: I never agreed to that.
DIGNAN: Bob, you're lying!
BOB: All right! Backyard! Right now!
DIGNAN: All right! Backyard! Right now!
DIGNAN: Let's go, Bob!
ANTHONY: Dignan. Take it easy.
DIGNAN: Bob is slowly moving toward the back door.
BOB: No, Dignan. This is stupid.
ANTHONY: Yeah. Dignan. Look. Let's just

ANTHONY: He doesn't want to fight.
DIGNAN: Get out of the way.

DIGNAN: No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
ANTHONY: Easy, Dignan. It's OK. It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
DIGNAN: It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
BOB: I didn't have any choice.
DIGNAN: I'm sorry, Bob.
BOB: That's OK.
ANTHONY: ( starting to laugh ) Shit, Dignan.
DIGNAN: ( smiles ) What the fuck are we doing out here?
ANTHONY: I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
DIGNAN: I'm sorry, Bob.
BOB: That's OK.
DIGNAN: Look. We want you on the job.
MR. HENRY: Let me get this straight. You don't play golf and you don't play tennis. So why do you belong to a country You got me.
BOB: You got me.
MR. HENRY: ( shakes his head ) You're a piece of work, Bob.
JACKSON: How you doing, Bob?
BOB: Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
JACKSON: You keeping out of trouble?
BOB: I'm trying.
JACKSON: ( looks at others at table ) This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
JACKSON: Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
BOB: He said what?
JACKSON: He said you ran away from home.
BOB: No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
DIGNAN: Bob looks at Dignan. Dignan's looking across the room. There's Future Man and his friend CLAY fresh from a round of golf. They're standing on the other side of the room, looking across at Bob. They're smiling. Jackson picks up two empty plates and walks away. Future Man and CLAY walk to Bob's table.
FUTURE MAN: Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
BOB: Yeah. Hey, Clay.
CLAY: Hi, Bob.
FUTURE MAN: ( smiling ) So what's shaking?
BOB: Nothing much.
FUTURE MAN: How's it going.
ANTHONY: Fine, thanks.
FUTURE MAN: John Mapplethorpe. How are you. Hi.
MR. HENRY: Good to know you, John.
BOB: Jackson says you told him I ran away from home.
FUTURE MAN: I might have mentioned it.
BOB: John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
FUTURE MAN: I know, Bob. You were on a secret I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
BOB: I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
FUTURE MAN: Right. I'm sorry. You've got a reputation to think
MR. HENRY: The world needs dreamers, son.
FUTURE MAN: MR. HENRY
MR. HENRY: The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
FUTURE MAN: Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
MR. HENRY: Pleasure to meet you, John.
FUTURE MAN: ( hesitantly ) Nice to meet you.
MR. HENRY: I hope this doesn't offend you, Bob. Your brother is a cocksucker.
BOB: No. That doesn't offend me.
DIGNAN: OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
ANTHONY: Eleven fifteen.
DIGNAN: OK. Mark that down.
ANTHONY: I did.
DIGNAN: God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Yeah. It's pretty good.
ANTHONY: Yeah. It's pretty good.
DIGNAN: It's like we've finally arrived.
DIGNAN: What are you writing?
MR. HENRY: Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
ANTHONY: So do I.
MR. HENRY: Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
ANTHONY: I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe
MR. HENRY: I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
ANTHONY: What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
MR. HENRY: Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods up here.
ANTHONY: ( long pause ) I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But
MR. HENRY: As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business? You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
ANTHONY: You're wrong about Dignan.
ANTHONY: And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
