JOHN: His hand adjusts a microphone on his lapel.
JOHN: Hello, hello. Hello.
JOHN: I don't believe in perfect love. You know, love that comes out of the sky like a thunderbolt and uh. This is

JOHN: Someone intelligent, of course. Kind. Pretty I suppose. But its not
JOHN: We all have someone in our past who uh. one skeleton, if you like. We've all got at least one person, as it were, under the patio. Not literally of course. I suppose I only say this because I always thought people who did this sort of thing were. I had an image that they were losers. Not losers. A bit sad. But I think this is the modern world. And I think really it's quite a brave move. Quite a brave, reasonable thing to do.
JOHN: Sorry can we start again?
BIRTHDAY GIRL: John's fingers in close-up, type JOHN BUCKINGHAM, and his AMEX number into his PC. Finished, he stops, and rests his face on his hands. He hits SEND. That instant, a worry of black crows bursts up in the field behind him and takes to the swirling air. Blackout. Music. Titles. The titles pop and slide over footage of Russian women, on computer video, advertising themselves. They mostly speak in Russian, some of which is subtitled, some speak in English. The women slide on and off the screen, overlap and collide, as the titles appear. Close-ups on mouths and eyes, tight and pixellated. It becomes a wall of image and sound.
JOHN: She nods.
JOHN: I'm John.
JOHN: ( pause ) Well. Look I didn't have a speech
JOHN: Is that everything?
NADIA: Right. Okay. Good.
JOHN: Right. Okay. Good.
JOHN: We can talk in the car.
JOHN: It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh. It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
NADIA: I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid. Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
JOHN: I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid. Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
NADIA: I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
JOHN: I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
NADIA: I mean. "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
JOHN: I mean. "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
JOHN: I had this.
JOHN: As a joke but uh.
JOHN: So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
NADIA: I bet. What about me? Am I how you imagined?
JOHN: I bet. What about me? Am I how you imagined?
NADIA: He double-takes, changes lanes.
JOHN: And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
NADIA: John looks across.
JOHN: Do uh. Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
NADIA: Good. Or should I speak slower?
JOHN: Good. Or should I speak slower?
NADIA: Do you follow or should I speak
JOHN: Do you follow or should I speak
NADIA: He looks across. Back at the road. He changes gear.
JOHN: Uh. Are you a giraffe?
NADIA: John turns to face the road ahead.
JOHN: ( to himself ) Oh Jesus.
JOHN: Oh Jesus.
JOHN: ( quietly )
JOHN: She glances around it. Then back at John. He nods to himself, looking tense and pale.
JOHN: He closes it.
JOHN: There it is. The Double Bed. John frowns gravely. Without warning, he marches out. She comes out onto the landing to catch John plus suitcase kicking open another door and vanishing inside.
JOHN: The uh. the other bedroom.
JOHN: I'll get an ashtray.

YURI: She says she took a picture.
ALEXEI: EXT. JOHN'S GARDEN - NIGHT The small party has moved outside to the patio, where they sit around a low wooden table in the mellow candlelight. A huge late Summer moon hangs over the fields. Alexei tinkles beautifully on his guitar. He stops asks a question in Russian.
JOHN: What was that?
YURI: Oh nothing.
JOHN: Tell me.
YURI: No. It is too judgmental.
JOHN: Tell me what he said.
YURI: He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
YURI: You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
JOHN: No. It's not that.
YURI: Do you believe in love?
JOHN: I suppose it's. I mean define your It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.

The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
YURI: Here look, something beautiful from Russia. Here is Life, there, take
YURI: Here is bread. Khylep. This is work. We all need this, here eat.
YURI: Good. But we cannot survive with just work, so here is meat and blood. Myasa. This is family and country, flesh, strength, eat.
YURI: But again this is not life. Here is joy and pain. Chyesnok. Without these life has no flavour, is too serious.
YURI: But this vodka. Is love. Only this magic changes you inside. The moon and the stars and the sun.
YURI: This is a love song, a soldier's song to his beloved Alexei, he's Afghanstya, a veteran of Afghanistan. He saw terrible things.
BRANCH MANAGER: Quick word John?
BRANCH MANAGER: This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.

JOHN: John begins to swim toward Alexei. Just as he gets near, Alexei lets Nadia surface, coughing and spluttering she shouts at Alexei in Russian, angry. Alexei makes for her again but she pushes him away, twice, almost slapping him. She is very uncomfortable. She swims Yuri admonishes his friend in Russian. Alexei stares at John, then swims off powerfully back towards the shore.
YURI: He's just having fun. He's maybe too strong you know.
NADIA: They go. John. They go.
JOHN: What's wrong?
NADIA: They go.
JOHN: Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.

JOHN: Good night.
YURI: John. You must call the Police.
JOHN: What are you doing?
YURI: John, I'm sorry. It's my fault.
JOHN: What's he doing? What the fuck are you doing? Leave her alone.
YURI: He says sit down. Or he'll cut her.
YURI: Sit down please.
JOHN: Tell him to stop and let her go, and we'll talk.
JOHN: Put the fucking kettle down.
YURI: Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
JOHN: Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
YURI: He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
JOHN: What? What does he want?
JOHN: What did he say? Tell me!
YURI: He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
JOHN: What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?

NADIA: What was 'Cats' like?
YURI: It was alright.
ALEXEI: Yeah it was okay.
YURI: Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
ALEXEI: The sets were good.
YURI: The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
ALEXEI: ( softly ) So. How many times did you have to fuck him?
YURI: How you doing? I'll show you something. It should make all this easier I think.
YURI: I'll show you something. It should make all this easier I think.

ALEXEI: That's not a burn.
NADIA: It is. I did it cooking.
ALEXEI: On both wrists?
NADIA: What? I did it cooking.
NADIA: They sit there in silence. Alexei is so big, and she is so Nadia leans over the bed, and searches in her bag. Alexei watches her closely. She comes back up with the jumper she has knitted.
NADIA: Listen, I made you something.
NADIA: Put it on.
NADIA: It's taken me weeks. I want to see you in it.
NADIA: Do you like it?
ALEXEI: He is still staring at her.
NADIA: Say thank you.
ALEXEI: Thank you.
NADIA: We're going to have a baby.
ALEXEI: You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks. We're having a baby. A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
NADIA: You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks. We're having a baby. A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?

NADIA: Just get me a coffee.
WAITRESS: One coffee. And for you Sir ?
NADIA: He'll have a coffee.
JOHN: You can't smoke in here.
JOHN: YOU CAN'T SMOKE IN HERE!
NADIA: I don't expect you to understand.
JOHN: Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
NADIA: You don't understand anything.
JOHN: I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking
JOHN: Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
NADIA: It's makes it easier. Okay.
JOHN: I don't want to know.
NADIA: It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
JOHN: That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy. So what are you going to do?
NADIA: So what are you going to do?
JOHN: I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
NADIA: They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
JOHN: Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
NADIA: Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a Well as it turns out I did. More coffee?
JOHN: Well as it turns out I did. More coffee?
WAITRESS: More coffee?
JOHN: Yes please.
NADIA: She pours for John.

NADIA: John, I need your help.
JOHN: You must think. I'm the biggest pillock. In the world.
NADIA: No I don't.
JOHN: In the world.
NADIA: I know you just want to punish me
JOHN: I do. I want to very badly.
NADIA: So you're just going to be vindictive
JOHN: In every sense. If at all possible.
NADIA: You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash. My name isn't Nadia.
JOHN: Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash. My name isn't Nadia.
NADIA: My name isn't Nadia.
NADIA: ( quietly, to John ) Where's the restroom?

NADIA: I'm going. I am. I'm going to be No you're not. How. Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?

NADIA: I said I don't have any.
JOHN: Give me your sunglasses.
JOHN: So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name.
NADIA: I don't want to talk about him.
JOHN: It's none of your business.

JOHN: Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again No. But you tend to tie them up.
NADIA: No. But you tend to tie them up.
JOHN: Fuck off.
JOHN: Fuck off. You started it.
JOHN: I don't want to talk about it.
NADIA: Why not?
JOHN: Shut up. I'm not listening.
NADIA: You don't want to talk about it.
JOHN: Okay we won't talk about it.
NADIA: Okay we won't talk about it.
NADIA: We'll pretend it never happened.
JOHN: So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
NADIA: I don't hate you.
JOHN: Okay. Let's. Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
NADIA: And? What are you saying?
JOHN: And. It's wrong.
NADIA: And who says what is wrong.
JOHN: And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
NADIA: What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
JOHN: So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
NADIA: Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
JOHN: Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
NADIA: Funny. Usually it's the first thing they do. So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
JOHN: So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
NADIA: Sometimes which?
JOHN: Sometimes which?
NADIA: Sometimes neither.
JOHN: Some. What does that mean?
