BAD BOYS: Revised Draft by
FOUCHET: What's taking so long back there?
ANDY: How do I look? Like the real thing, yeah?
FOUCHET: Step back and lemme get a good look at you.
FOUCHET: Tell me again about your assignment, Andrew?
ANDY: I'm the decoy.
FOUCHET: Right you are.
FOUCHET: Please help! I just saw a policeman shot! Send help. Hurry! I'm at the corner of...
POLICE RADIO (V.O.): Report of an officer down. Be advised, all units. Corner of Lennox and Taylor.
LOWREY: Good evening.    I'm Mike --
BURNETT: -- And I'm Marcus.
LOWREY: We're lookin' for a couple of our Latin friends who checked in a little while ago. You might remember them?
DESK MANAGER: I'm sorry.   But our guest list is private.
LOWREY: Oh, didn't they say? There's going to be party! It's
B.Y.O.B.O. --: (leans in close) The B.O. stands for baby oil.
BURNETT: Maybe you can come. Get off after you get off?
DESK MANAGER: Well, now that you mention it. They were kinda cute. Suite 202.
LOWREY: Police!   On the floor!
BURNETT: Lowrey!
BURNETT: (scraped, bruised, pissed) Nice backup.
LOWREY: What?
FOUCHET: It's time.
FOUCHET: We're in.     Start the video.
FOUCHET: (into mic) Where's Deputy Dog?
FERGUSON (V.O.): (over radio mic) He made us.
FOUCHET: Then do him, now!
LATINA TWIN: 'Morning.
LOWREY: (shaking his head) Oh man...
THERESA: Marcus, what are you doing?
BURNETT: We're always saying we should spend more quality time together. Well, I got the time... and you got the quality...
BURNETT: I can remember when we used to do it every morning.
THERESA: That was how we got a three bedroom house filled with little Burnetts.
BURNETT: Been over a week since I've had some quality time!
JILL: Mom, Quincy pushed me.
QUINCY: Uncle Mike showed me that move.
THERESA: Quincy, never-you-mind. And take those things off in the house! Jill, stop with the book and eat your breakfast. (then, exasperated) Marcus, why do I always have to discipline the kids? You play bad cop for a second.
BURNETT: Kids, knock it off... or your momma's gonna whoop your butts!
LOWREY: Ah, family life. Reminds me why I stay single.
JILL & QUINCY: Uncle Mike!   Uncle Mike!
LOWREY: Hiya, kids.   Mornin', Theresa.
THERESA: Don't kiss me, Lowrey. I don't know where those lips were last night.
THERESA: Don't go tellin' my son about your sleazy sex life?
LOWREY: I promise, Theresa. I only tell your husband about my sleazy sex life.
THERESA: I don't want him knowing about it either! Gives him ideas. (answers the phone) Hello? Oh, sure. Which one of them do you want?
LOWREY: You're live with Lowrey. (listens for a long beat) 'Scuse me, Captain. I think you mean to say, 'Get the fuck down here, please?'
THERESA: Not so fast. You were going to take the kids to school today, remember, hon? I have a job interview...
BURNETT: Hey, Dick. How many times I gotta tell you? I don't work robbery. I'm in Narcotics.
LOWREY: Don't get your sticky fingers all over my windows... and keep your feet off the seats, I just had the leather conditioned.
THERESA: Marcus... I need you to stop at Save-More on the way home and pick up exactly what's on the list.
BURNETT: Oh, baby.   Damn.
BURNETT: Twins?
LOWREY: If I'm lyin' I'm dyin'. Her sister came down and posted the girl's bail. And later? Man, talk about special effects.
BURNETT: What special effects?
FRANCINE: Evidence room. Howard's waiting for you.
BURNETT: Your kids are lookin' sharp, Francine.
RUIZ: Could it be... Dopey?
LOWREY: If it ain't the leftovers from Miami Vice. Fashion casualties, lost somewhere in the eighties.
BURNETT: And the women really go for that. Really, they do.
HOWARD: Nice of you to roll in. And nothing particular is going on around here except, maybe, your dope is gone. That's right. The biggest dope bust in the history of this department up and walked out of this locker, along with maybe my job and the two of yours if we don't get the shit back.
BURNETT: This can't be happening.
LOWREY: So I guess we should start with the C.I.s and the perps from the original case. But hell if I know any dope dealers with the balls to pull this off. They're either dead or in the lock-up pending trial.
BURNETT: How's O'Fee?
SINCLAIR (O.S.): Oh, he'll be just fine.
HOWARD: Name's Sinclair. Internal Affairs. He's our new proctologist.
SINCLAIR: You see, what's got me confused is, why risk leaving a witness? Why not kill O'Fee instead?
BURNETT: Because maybe this guy knows if you kill a cop the whole department'll get up his ass hard and fast.
SINCLAIR: And who knows that better than anybody else? Cops.
BURNETT: You're not sayin' this was an inside job. Cops wouldn't pull this shit.
LOWREY: Hey, fuck you and your cheap, off- the-rack suit.
HOWARD: Enough. I.A.'s in it and there's nothing we can do about it. If any of this leaks, the shit's gonna hit our biggest fan. Remember him? The mayor? He created us and you can bet your jobs, boys, he'll rip us into little cop pieces. I figure we got seventy-two hours to find the dope and keep our jobs.
LOWREY: Nothing like a little old-fashioned incentive.
BURNETT: What about the air conditioning?
HOWARD: So what about it?
BURNETT: (to Lowrey) What do you think?
LOWREY: I think you should go ahead, crawl up and give it a good look.
BURNETT: Why me?
BURNETT: Don't say nothin' about my clothes. I paid for these.
LOWREY: And I don't?
BURNETT: Not on a cop's salary.
LOWREY: Anything?
BURNETT: Yeah. I got some weird track marks in here.
HOWARD: Nice and cool up there, Burnett? Comfy? Maybe there's a new career for you in building maintenance.
BURNETT: There's gonna be a lotta cash when the dope hits the street. We want you to put the word out through your bank and hustle the account.  You help us, maybe we can see about getting those R.T.C. auditors off your ass.
LOWREY: Listen, Cedras. You and I both know you're the number one importer for the Simona Brothers. And I'm tellin' you there's a buttload of H on the move and someone's gonna wanna stick their dick in it. So it better not be yours. You hear something? You call us. You hear nada? You better get the fuck outta town.
BURNETT: Not a fucking lead. So now that we've done the obvious, we need a shortcut.
LOWREY: Okay.   So we talk to Max.
BURNETT: Huh uh. Not this time. I'm tired of you working pussy into everything we do.
LOWREY: You got a better idea?
MAX: Hi, Mike.   You come to work-out?
LOWREY: Raincheck, darlin'. Gotta talk. Anyplace we can go?
BURNETT: Huh?
MAX: That's what I thought.
LOWREY: Sorry to come around only when I need something.
MAX: Forget about it. I owe you the rest of my life, Mike.
MAX: Don't be lookin' at me like I'm getting all sentimental.
LOWREY: Hey, I didn't open my mouth. Listen, there's some major, major ill shit happening down at the P.D. Lotta heroin involved. There's gonna be a lotta cash involved, too. Gonna be some happy motherfuckers around that wanna party.
MAX: So you want me to check around?
LOWREY: Just make a coupla calls. See what's what. Don't be doin' no wild shit. Just call me if you hear something.
BURNETT: A cop.
BLACK WOMAN: Oooh.    I love cops.
BURNETT: You know? I'm a cop. I shot somebody just last week. Didn't kill him, just shot him in the ass.
LOWREY: You know, that was really smooth. Think you could do that again? (as they start walking) Ohh. I'll tell you, when the wife gets meaner, the grass gets greener.
BURNETT: Green ain't the color I was thinkin' of. More of a coco puff. Just real shiny, thick...
BURNETT: Damn! The woman's got fuckin' radar on my ass. Sensed me lookin' at another woman. Bet she wants me to pick up Huggies 'stead of those baby Garanimals that they wear.
LOWREY: I don't think anybody could be that married.
LOWREY: (complies) Miami's the perfect town for you, Burnett. You drive like a one- hundred-seven-year-old lady with her turn signal on.
BURNETT: And I plan on living to be old just like 'em. Rubbin' Ben Gay on my joints and everythin'.
LOWREY: You gonna let every old motherfucker pass you? Or just the ones with big-ass trailers draggin' behind? A-c-c-el-er-ate.
BURNETT: I don't have a death wish like you. I  got a family that counts on me.  A mortgage to pay. And I'm not sayin' it's me, but most of the guys in the station think you're some rich kid playin' cop.
LOWREY: Who said that?
LOWREY: If somebody's talking about me, I wanna know... Man, I'm so sick of this. I don't apologize for nothing I do. I get up early and take it to the max every day. I'm always the first guy through the door. And the last guy to leave a crime scene. So fuck 'em all. I could give a shit what those boot lickin', brown-nosin', ass kissin' motherfuckers think of Mike Lowrey.
LOWREY: Oh, fuck you, Marcus.
DISPATCHER (V.O.): (over radio) Two-one? I got that address for you on the air conditioning company. Oh, and Theresa called, she added something to your grocer list: Muppets toothpaste. Bubble gum flavor. She says Quincy doesn't like mint.
LOWREY: Yeah. Roger that. Gimme the address.
DISPATCHER (V.O.): Orona's been working out of his house. He's at...
LOWREY: The air conditioning business has been good to Orona.
BURNETT: Well, we can leave a note or we can break and enter --
LOWREY: Wait. Hear that? I thought I heard Orona beating his wife.
LOWREY: Uh oh.    No alarm.
BURNETT: Aw, man.    Did you cut one?
LOWREY: No, man.    Musta been you.
BURNETT: Not me.
LOWREY AND BURNETT: Dead guy.
LOWREY: Now what?
BURNETT: Where are the drugs? (no answer) Where... are... the... drugs? (shrugs) He ain't sayin' nothin'. He must be guilty of somethin'.
BURNETT: Whoa. Watch where you're swinging them dead arms, Orona. You're gonna fuck up your own crime scene.
BURNETT: Watch what you touch.   That's evidence.
BURNETT: Not touching. Browsing... Mr. Orona. You've got the right to remain silent. Anything you say'll surprise the shit out of us.
BURNETT: Anything?
LOWREY: (finds small notepad) Jai-Alai. Dog track. Lotta bookies. Phone numbers.
BURNETT: Lemme guess. Guy does the air conditioning contract for the P.D. He'd have the plans.
LOWREY: He trades the plans for his paper and gets popped by the perps.
BURNETT: Works for me. Now can we go? I'm gonna puke.
LOIS: I'm not doing any favors for Mike Lowrey.
MAX: Then call it a favor for me. Please?
LOIS: Okay, then. I'll make the calls. But you have to talk to Julie.
MAX: I'll talk to her but she's not into it.
LOIS: All you have to say is that she'll be getting paid for what she already does for free.
JULIE: Okay.   So what'd I miss?
MAX: George?
JULIE: Bad moods after a bad round of golf... I had blonde hair, then.
MAX: What about Ronny?
JULIE: Sex addict.     Coke addict. Redhead.
MAX: You were a redhead?
JULIE: Only for two days. It wasn't even a phase.
MAX: Okay.   Mark.
JULIE: But that's my point. I remember my hair phases more than I remember the men. (playful, sarcastic) So, a party in a Biltmore Hotel suite? Yeah, that'll really rock.
MAX: It's a favor for a friend. If it sucks after a half-hour, we'll split and head to South Beach.
JULIE: A favor?
MAX: You know, my friend Mike Lowrey.
JULIE: (rolls her eyes) Mike Lowrey. Not again. Will you just have sex with the man and get it over with.
MAX: He's just a friend.
JULIE: Yeah, right.     You're in love.
MAX: It's never gonna happen. I'm great at turning lovers into friends. But turning friends into lovers, I can't do.
JULIE: Well, I don't date cops. They never have enough money and they're always too tired to screw.
MAX: Well, I've told you before, my Mike isn't like that. If I were in real trouble, Mike Lowrey is the only person I'd call.
EDDIE: Max, my little carina. It's been a long time. And who's your friend?
MAX: Eddie.   Julie.
EDDIE: Come on, Julie. Come in, Max. Welcome to the Al Capone suite.
EDDIE: I'm not kidding. Capone had the place fixed up with secret passages and hidden stairways. Can you dig it? People were actually killed within these walls.
JULIE: Excuse me?   I need to use the bathroom.
EDDIE: Wow, Maxi. I thought you dropped off the edge of the earth and died. Either that or you moved to California.
FOUCHET: Who's the girl, Eddie?
EDDIE: Just a hooker --
MAX: My name's Max. (outstretched hand) I'm just a friend.
FOUCHET: I could use a friend who looks like you. Turn around. Lemme get a good look.
FOUCHET: You're a fucking idiot. Hookers talk. Now, is that my dope?
EDDIE: (freaked) Our dope... That was the deal, yeah? Right. Until we got the money --
EDDIE: You fucker... fucker fucker fucker!!!
FOUCHET: I have four more days until I make the deal. When it's done you get your money. Now, what part don't you understand?
EDDIE: Hey, man.   You need me.
FOUCHET: I don't need anybody. I got three little angels looking over my shoulder.
CASPER: Aw, man. You got blood on my new suit.
FOUCHET: Ever hear of dry cleaning? Now, shut the fuck up, check for the rest of my dope.
CASPER: Now look. My fuckin' shoes.      My fuckin' Italian shoes!
FOUCHET: She's a hooker. Find out who she works for. Find out where she lives.
RUIZ: You guys watch where you're walking or you'll fuck up the crime scene.
BURNETT: Looks like you're already doing that.
HOWARD: Two dead. A hood registered as Eddie Dominguez and some Jane Doe. But the table over there's covered in high-grade dope. Sound familiar?
LOWREY: I think we    got us a witness. Over here    I got two different shades of    lipstick on one champagne    glass.
BURNETT: Jesus, no...
LOWREY: Whatcha got?
LOWREY: What?     Who is it?
LOWREY: I shoulda told you to be careful.
LOWREY: Eddie Dominguez. I want his phone calls.
HOTEL CLERK: You pay the bill you can see his phone calls.
LOWREY: I'm sorry.     Maybe I wasn't polite enough.
BURNETT: I wouldn't fuck with him right now.
BURNETT: Uh oh... Alright, you check out Lois, then check in --
LOIS FIELDS: I'm sorry, Jimmy. But you can't have her. Shelly only models and that's all... That's right. Like I always say, some girls do, some girls don't, and the rest you can't afford -- (line cuts out) Hello? Jimmy... Jimmy?
HOWARD: Did you check parole? How about F.B.I. or D.E.A.? They're supposed to be compliant with our requests? And where the hell's Lowrey?
BURNETT: (hand over phone) Following this Lois Fields lead. I just paged him.
HOWARD: The madame? What's it with this guy? It's always girls, girls, girls.
BURNETT: (as Theresa screams) No, Theresa... No, he wasn't talking about you.
BACK-UP COPS (V.O.): (over radio) Pulling up now, twenty-one-two. Give us your twenty in the residence... twenty-one-two. Do you copy. Twenty-one-two...
BURNETT: Theresa, I know it was my idea. I know I was the one who wanted a little quality time.  It's just that this can't wait.  Can't I just wake you up when I get home?
HOWARD: It's about fuckin' time. (answers) Howard here.
JULIE: I need to talk to Detective Lowrey!
HOWARD: He's not here. How can I help you?
JULIE: You can get me Detective Lowrey!
HOWARD: This isn't another paternity case, is it?
JULIE: No.     It's another murder case.
HOWARD: Did this happen at the Biltmore Hotel?
JULIE: Listen! I just saw my best friend murdered. I'm soaking wet. I'm alone, I'm scared and I'll only talk to Mike Lowrey!
HOWARD: Don't hang up. Lemme find him. (hand over phone) Page Lowrey. Find out where he is!
BURNETT: Theresa.     I gotta go.
BURNETT: I can't be Lowrey.
HOWARD: Shut up and listen! She'll only talk to Lowrey. She says she's our witness. That means she's our only link to the dope, not to mention my pension plan, so get on the phone.
BURNETT: Yo, you are live with Lowrey... (then into phone) Yo, you're live with Lowrey.
JULIE (O.S.): Who's there?
BURNETT: Mike Lowrey.
JULIE: How do I know it's Detective Lowrey?
BURNETT: ... 'Cuz I'm Mike Lowrey.      I'm a cop. Wanna see my badge?
JULIE: Yes! I wanna see it now! I'm not letting you through the fucking door until I do. Hold it up to the peephole!
JULIE: Anybody can get one of those.
BURNETT: (annoyed) Hey, lady. You called me, remember...? 'On the mike with Mike.'
JULIE: You're not Mike Lowrey!
BURNETT: What do you mean I'm not Mike Lowrey? You never even met him! Me.
JULIE: The way Max described you was different.
BURNETT: I'm undercover.
BURNETT: Okay.    I'm way undercover.
JULIE: Prove it!
BURNETT: I knew her from way back. From time to time, you know... We'd get together. Mess around, you know?
JULIE: Wrong.
BURNETT: Okay. Okay. So I exaggerated. It's a man thing.
BURNETT: You know what? You don't wanna believe me? That's fine with me! Go it alone.
BURNETT: You don't got any more golf clubs or bats, do you? Nothin' that you can swing at me, do you?
BURNETT: Then lemme introduce myself. I'm Mike Lowrey. And I'm here to help you.
JULIE: You're not what I expected.
BURNETT: Yeah, well neither are you.      You swing like Barry Bonds.
BURNETT: Alright. Look here, I need to know if you've called anybody. Or if you told anybody else where you are?
JULIE: No.   Nobody.
BURNETT: Good.     You got a back door?
JULIE: Where are we going? (as she stuffs the dog into the tote) Duke!
JULIE: (pulls away) Whoa! Fuck that. I'll only deal with you. Otherwise, I'll take my chances.
BURNETT: Let's go!
JULIE: Luke?!   Where's my other dog?!
BURNETT: Fuck the dog!
BURNETT: Fine time to bark. Where were you when they were comin' up the walk? (beat) Shit. Bet they got a look at my license plates. If you saw him again, would you remember the guy who shot Max?
JULIE: All I remember is one of them had really bad hair. Where are we going?
BURNETT: I told you, I'm putting you into protective custody...
JULIE: (cuts him off) No way. Listen, no offense, but I don't trust anybody.
BURNETT: Yeah.   I noticed.
BURNETT: (exasperated again) Fine. So what do you want to do? Where will you feel safe?
JULIE: I didn't really think about it. I guess it's your place or a plane ticket. Your place is cheaper. So you choose.
BURNETT: My place? Okay, good.   No, wait. My place is wrong.
BURNETT: I mean right. As in good. My place is good. We'll go there first. (confirms) My place.
CHET: Detective Burnett... Mr. Lowrey is out...
BURNETT: He told me I could use the place tonight...
CHET: Didn't mention it to me.
CHET: Say.   How's that Mrs. Burnett?
CHET: Your children good? Mr. Lowrey says you got a regular baby factory goin' over there.
CHET: Now that I think about it, Mr. Lowrey did mention something about giving you the key.
BURNETT: I forgot I had those switches moved. Welcome to Casa del Lowrey.
JULIE: Nice... very nice. All this on a cop's salary?
BURNETT: I uh... I invest.
JULIE: Right. What was your last pick? A horse in the number two race at Pimlico? Or did a bookie give you an inside tip.
BURNETT: -- My father invests... Listen. You must be tired --
JULIE: I'll ask you this only   once, Mike. Are you on the take?    And if you say no and I discover   you're lying to me, I'll walk. Are    we clear?
BURNETT: Heh -- all these damn things look alike. (switches it off) Well, gotta run... There's probably a couple of good steaks in the fridge for the dogs. Help yourself to whatever. (starts to go) I'll check on you in the morning.
JULIE: Where are you going?
BURNETT: Uh, back to the P.D. I got paperwork back on my desk to go through that's about this high. (to his armpits) And now there's you, so that makes it this high.
JULIE: You mean, you're going to leave me alone? In your place. With all your stuff?
BURNETT: Why shouldn't I? Are you a thief or a vandal?
JULIE: Of course not. And I'm not a call girl, either.
BURNETT: I didn't ask.
JULIE: I know you didn't. I just thought you should know.
JULIE: Just one more thing.
JULIE: Thank you.   For everything.
BURNETT: Don't mention it.
JULIE: Aren't you going to --
LOWREY'S MACHINE (V.O.): Hi. You're live with Lowrey. Leave it at the beep.
YVETTE (V.O.): Miiike... it's Yvette... I know I told you I don't date cops. And I know I told you I wouldn't sleep with a man I wasn't going to marry. But I've been thinking -- and I remember when you said thinking was a dangerous thing -- so I started feeling... well, lonely. Remember when you gave me that key --
BURNETT: It's uh... It's uh...
JULIE: You don't have to explain.
BURNETT: Lock the door. Don't open it for anybody.
BURNETT: Listen, Chet. The girl? She's a witness. I'm gonna be gone for about an hour. Do me a favor. Keep your eye out, okay?
CHET: You know, Mr. Burnett. I'm getting off in just a few minutes, so... I could watch the door if you like. You know. In a chair. I could just sit in it. Outside the door like cops do when they're guarding shit.
BURNETT: Just keep an eye out.
CHET: Yeah, I was gonna be a cop, you know? Just didn't work out. You know? Politics.
DORIS: Don't you 'Honey Baby' me --
BURNETT: -- I swear, baby, it's nothing. I was on the job --
DORIS: And you just happened to lose your wedding ring -- 'on the job?!'
BURNETT: No!   No!    I got it right here...
LOWREY: Yeah.   Thanks for the get-well card.
BURNETT: Chief. I tried to set   the girl up with a sketch artist  but she won't. I tried to get   her to come in and look at the mug  books and she won't come in.
HOWARD: She'll only deal with Mike Lowrey.
BURNETT: That's right. So let her deal with the real Mike Lowrey! Who, I might add, shoulda been there to take the call instead of runnin' off like a hot dog without any backup.
LOWREY: Hey. I'm not the one who left a strange hooker alone in my apartment. You know, she's probably on the street sellin' all my shit as we speak.
BURNETT: I had to stash her somewhere! She's scared shitless... just like her dogs.
HOWARD: Not a good idea. (brick) Until she I.D.s the shotters, he's Mike Lowrey. Could take a coupla hours. Could take all day. You got a computer with a modem?
BURNETT: Big computer.    Expensive --
LOWREY: Yeah, I got a computer and you shouldn't touch it. It took me weeks to get it set up the way I want it and I don't want amateurs messing with it.
HOWARD: (brick number four) Burnett. I'll have Francine give you the user code for the computer files and you can run pictures for the girl on Lowrey's super duper computer.
BURNETT: So what about me? I can't    tell my wife I'm shacked up with a   female witness! Besides, I think    they made my car last night... I   gotta stay close to home, just in   case.
HOWARD: Easy. Lowrey moves into your house. And you're on special assignment.
LOWREY: No way!   I'm not living in that zoo.
BURNETT: My house ain't no zoo!
THERESA: You never had to go to Cleveland on police business before.
BURNETT: Cleveland's where they collared the dealer. And that's where I gotta go to testify.
THERESA: But what about us? The neighborhood's had all break-ins. I won't feel safe if you're --
BURNETT: Honey. I wouldn't go if I didn't have the most trustworthy man I know to look after my family...
THERESA: Oh, no,   Not Lowrey. Not in my house.
BURNETT: Yes, Lowrey. I trust him with my life and, I most certainly trust him with yours.
THERESA: Why don't they send him to Cleveland?
BURNETT: Baby. It's a Federal subpoena. I'm the witness. I'm the one who has to testify. Case closed. I'm the one going to Cleveland. Lowrey's staying here.
BURNETT: Don't forget to put Snail Guard on my lawn.
LOWREY: Just leave Cleveland the way you found it.
BURNETT: Bye-bye, Theresa. Be good, kids.
THERESA: Why's he taking your car?
LOWREY: (seething) He's dropping it off at the mechanic on the way to the airport. The engine  needs an overhaul... or will by the time he gets there.
THERESA: Where you think you're going? I got a list here of things that Marcus was supposed --
LOWREY: -- that Marcus was supposed to do. That's right. Marcus. Not Mike. 'Cuz Mike's a cop on a case with no time to waste.
FOUCHET: Okay. Explain it to me, Elliot. Why are we behind?
ELLIOT: The cutting agent is highly volatile. You can't cook it like you would a pizza. I had to gear the ovens down to half-speed.
FOUCHET: We already accounted for that, Elliot. It's in our fucking timetable. So what else?
ELLIOT: There's too much moisture down here. The pies are taking longer to cook than we originally planned.
WALLY: Yeah.   It's totally fucked.
FOUCHET: You.  Shut up. (back to Elliot) Now, listen, you little pussy. We're not making pizza.
BURNETT (O.S.): Julie!
JULIE: That you, Mike?
BURNETT (O.S.): Yeah.    It's me. Mike.
JULIE: At least your timing's good. Can you bring me the lotion on the nightstand?
BURNETT: (to himself) Crazy fuckin' woman.
JULIE: The guy who killed Max. Now, he was looking for the heroin that Eddie stole from him... Max went to the party as a favor to you. You're a dope cop, right?
BURNETT: Special Narcotics Division.
JULIE: So this isn't about Max's death at all. It's about dope.
BURNETT: We find the dope, we find our shooter, too.
JULIE: There's some powder in there, too. Can you hand that to me? (waits for an answer) Mike? Mike?
JULIE (O.S.): Mike? I borrowed a T-shirt and some boxer shorts until we can somehow get back over to my place to pick up some clothes.
BURNETT: Mug shots. We got mug shots to look at. 'Scuse me, I gotta hook into the P.D. computer.
JULIE: Hey, Mike. Who's the guy in all the pictures?
BURNETT: That guy? Well, that's Marcus Burnett, my partner.
BURNETT: There's the two of us, see?     Me'n'... (gestures to photos) ... My partner.
JULIE: Listen, Mike. I've known a lotta guys. And I've seen a good number of their bedrooms, okay? But I've never seen... I mean, look at it. It's like a shrine to him.
JULIE: Saved your life?
BURNETT: I save his life. He saves mine. He's got the same thing in his house. Pictures of me. More, even. Good family man, that Marcus.
JULIE: Okay, but Mike. This is like a lot of pictures. I mean, this isn't something by the bedstand. This is a whole wall... And I know Max said you were just friends. That's why I was thinking, maybe... you could be... gay.
BURNETT: Me? Gay?   Are you outta your mind?
JULIE: I didn't mean to offend you.
BURNETT: It's a good thing that I'm secure in my manhood to see that you don't mean that. You know how many women I've had in that waterbed? Check the waves as they go by. Count 'em. (turns back to living room) Now, mug shots?
JULIE: Somethin' weird. Sounded like three angels... He wasn't worried because he had three little angels on his shoulders tellin' him something. I didn't get the rest. (back to the mug shots) I'm getting tired of looking at ugly people.
BURNETT: Just a few more and we can take another break.
JULIE: I don't wanna take a break. Then we'd have to talk and I got nothing to say to a cannibal.
BURNETT: A what?
JULIE: That was a living, breathing consciousness. It felt joy. Sadness. Maybe it even had a name.
BURNETT: What had a name.
JULIE: That flesh you're shoveling into your mouth.
BURNETT: (stops chewing) It's just bologna.
JULIE: It was alive. Some farmer  fed it. Got it to trust him. Then  blew its brains out, dumped it in a cement mixer with a ton of carcinogens and now you're   eating it.
JULIE: No. At least finish it so I won't have to look at it. (back to the screen) Let's look at some more ugly people.
JULIE: Wait. Hold it. Go back... That's him! That's one of 'em.
BURNETT: You sure?
LOWREY: Captain Howard, please.    It's Lowrey.
MEGAN (O.S.): Uncle Mike --
MEGAN: But I have to go now!
MEGAN: Uncle Mike!
LOWREY: Okay... Hang on, Cappy. (starts reading from the book) This is Prudence and she has to go potty. This is a potty. Everyone has to poop and when they do they use the potty. (turns page) Mommies poop. (turns page) Daddies poop. (turns page) Captain Howard poops. Even doggies poop.
BURNETT: Your dog took a shit.
JULIE: And you used Pledge to clean it up?
BURNETT: (looks at can) Lemon Pledge.
JULIE: Well, that makes a big difference. You just varnished that into the fabric. I'm sure it works great.
JULIE: I just threw them in with mine.
BURNETT: You cleaned my clothes?
BURNETT: What's this??
JULIE: (shyly) I had a little accident.
BURNETT: This is my favorite shirt.   My lucky shirt.
JULIE: Sorry.
JULIE: Listen, Mike. I don't have any of my clothes. I wanna go back to my place to get some.
BURNETT: Not going to happen.
JULIE: I need apparel. That and I need some food that's something more than a cold, slab of fear.
BURNETT: Slab of fear?
JULIE: All you got in the place are frozen steaks.
BURNETT: Alright. I left my wallet at the office so I'll give you some cash tomorrow.
LOWREY (O.S.): ... so your daddy and I are trapped in this crack house in Little Havana. These dudes were real mean mothers... and they start coming at us with knives... Now I'm scared, thinkin' I'm out for the count when in comes your daddy like a Miami hurricane --
LOWREY: Oh, hi, Theresa. Just tellin' the kids about --
THERESA: Thank you, but I'll tuck the kids in. Say good night to Uncle Mike.
QUINCY: But we want to hear the rest of the story...
LOWREY: G'night, gang.
QUINCY AND JILL: G'night, Uncle Mike.
THERESA: If you were my husband, I'd poison that.
LOWREY: If you were my wife I'd drink it.
THERESA: Twelve years I'm married, Michael. And I never let Marcus bring his work home.
LOWREY: Just a harmless bedtime story. Thought the kids deserved to know about the hero they have for a dad.
THERESA: We don't need any violence in this household and we certainly don't need any more heroes. What we need is a father and a husband.
LOWREY: Husband? Theresa. He's your personal errand boy. You beep the poor S.O.B. every hour on the Goddamn hour? And why is it always about some useless bullshit that can wait until later. I mean, the guy's gotta job to do.
THERESA: You wanna know why I page him? Because until that phone rings, I don't know whether he's dead or alive. And lemme tell you. Those three minutes I'm waiting for him to call back? Those are the hardest three minutes for a cop's wife.
LOWREY: (toasts with the Coke) Touche, Theresa.
SANCHEZ: Ooh, mean machine, Lowrey...
LOWREY: You should recognize trunk. It's the one you came to America in.
RUIZ: You don't come from Cuba by car, asshole.
LOWREY: Oh, please. Big fucking deal. You know what I had to do? I drove your kids to school this morning. Your son forgot his homework. So I had to drive him all the way back in that junker of yours -- (as if looking at Burnett for the first time) What's that you're wearin'? Is that my new silk shirt? Is that my shirt?
BURNETT: Yeah. I know, it's a little big on me. But cool. I figure, what about it? If I'm gonna be Mike, might as well dress like Mike! (singing) I wanna be, I wanna be like Mike. Swish.
LOWREY: Ugh.   I gotta call the wife.
BURNETT: The wife?
LOWREY: Yeah, what's up, baby. Uh-huh. (pulls out notepad) Yeah. Okay. What else? You want me do what?
LOWREY: Say, why don't you rent a movie or somethin'? Uh-huh. (teasing laugh) You're so silly.
LOWREY: So, baby.   What you wearin'?
BURNETT: Gimme that phone. (grabs it) Hello, Theresa? Theresa!
LOWREY: Man, it's off. It was a joke.
BURNETT: Hey, man. Don't mess with me! That's the mother of my children. Don't break up a happy home.
LOWREY: Marcus, this is crazy. We are five minutes away from picking up this asshole and returning to our lives. And we're here doin' this shit. Where the fuck is it?
BURNETT: Hey. Don't ask me to find it for you. You're the expert on my wife.
BURNETT: You don't even know where you're going. You're in the wrong aisle.
BURNETT: You think you know what Theresa needs, man, but I do this every month. (challenges) Just look for 'Fresh Days.'
LOWREY: You're unbalanced. Listen, I read the parole jacket on this guy Noah. Armed robbery. Attempted murder. He's a violent offender somethin' like nine times. Sweet guy. Not a single drug bust on his sheet.
BURNETT: So? He's a new recruit. Keep looking, will ya? 'Fresh Days.'
LOWREY: You know, it is a damn shame she makes you buy this stuff.
BURNETT: Hey, this what husband's do.
LOWREY: Terrible fuckin' job. (examining shelves) It's like shaving cream. They're all the same. Fresh. Free. Confident. Secure. (grabs a box) Super wide? What the fuck? We're takin' this one.
BURNETT: Hey, man, look! You're not even reading. These are panty liners, okay?
BURNETT: That's a whole 'nother category of thing! Man, for a guy that spends all his time chasing pussy, you sure don't know much about the woo woo. (beat) Here it is. Fresh Days. You pay for it.
BURNETT: What are we gonna be today? Postal Inspectors or Water and Power?
LOWREY: Water and Power.
BURNETT: What do you think the chain's for?
LOWREY: I dunno. Maybe some kind of hurricane anchor.
BURNETT: Well, the anchor just moved.
BURNETT: AAAAAAAAAAA-Animal Control!
WOMAN: But your uniforms say Water and Power!
LOWREY: We're undercover! Now, we're lookin' for the owner of that animal.
WOMAN: Listen. The cat don't belong to me. It belong to my brother. And I don't know where he is.
BURNETT: That's too bad. Because his lion's tied to your trailer. So you gotta move the beast. Or move the trailer.
WOMAN: Move the trailer? Move it to where?
LOWREY: Everglades. Only part of South Florida that's zoned for Wild Kingdom shit. 'Course, the crocks down there'll probably eat your brother's cat.
WOMAN: But he loves that lion! Raised him from a little kitty!
BURNETT: Well, little kitty's gonna be gator bait 'less you suddenly remember where your brother is.
CHET: (to each of them) 'Morning, Mr. Lowrey. 'Morning, Mr. Lowrey.
BURNETT: It's me, Julie...
JULIE: I'll be ready in just a minute. I thought I'd have you tell --
JULIE: Hi. I'm Julie. You must be Marcus. (hand outstretched) I recognize you from all the photographs. Nice to meet you. (turns around for Burnett) What do you think?
LOWREY: Very nice.   The occasion?
JULIE: He said we were going to a club tonight.
BURNETT: Yes. We were going to a club.     As in me and my partner.
LOWREY: What's that on the rug?    Looks like... a stain?
JULIE: It was my babies, Luke and Duke. They get nervous in new surroundings. I offered to pay for the cleaning, but Mike wouldn't hear of it --
LOWREY: And have you ever heard of a new invention called the 'coaster'?
JULIE: Marcus, you act like it's your place.
BURNETT: What?
LOWREY: No. It's not my place. My wife. She's a designer. She decorated the whole place at a discount just for Mike. And when she hears about how he's been taking care of -- (glares witheringly at dogs) Off the couch!
WOMAN: Mike?
WOMAN: I'm feeling really nasty right now.
WOMAN: Who the hell are you?
BURNETT: How did you get in here?
WOMAN: I have a key.     But, Mike...
BURNETT: (whispers) Maybe you should call first next time. What's your name?
WOMAN: Yvette!
BURNETT: You don't quit stalking me, Yvette, I'm gonna place your ass under arrest! -- 'Bye!
LOWREY: 'The hell's going on out here??
LOWREY: Yvette!? You didn't just send away Yvette?
BURNETT: That woman's into some weird shit.
JULIE: (to Burnett) So, Mike. Any other spontaneous naked women with keys, that we should know about?
BURNETT: We, as in Marcus and I, are going to Club Hell. We're gonna nail this Noah guy and get him to give up Max's shooter. Anyone got a problem with that?
JULIE: I feel safer now.
LOWREY: You are ruining my life!
BURNETT: Yeah, well this case is messin' with mine, too.
FOUCHET: My three little angels told me I'd get a visit from the cops tonight and there they are. (turns and orders) When they split up, we'll drop the tall one and get the other one to lead us to the girl.
LOWREY: I say we split the room in half. Make our own moves. Hook back up at the bar in twenty minutes.
BURNETT: Sounds good to me.
LOWREY: Anything?
BURNETT: Bartender says he works here. But she hasn't seen him all night. (finishing his drink) I gotta make a pitstop.
BURNETT: Oh, man.     Budweiser...
CASPER: Excuse me?
BURNETT: Musta drank about a million Budweisers tonight, waitin' for my ol' friend Noah to show. Wouldn't know him, would ya? Guy practically raised me up from nothin'.
CASPER: Sorry.   Never heard of him.
BURNETT: Too bad.
CASPER: Okay, hardon!    Tell me where the girl is!
LOWREY: What the hell are you doing here?
JULIE: The guy who killed Max.   I remember something he said!
JULIE: Three little angels! The guy who killed Max said 'three little --
LOWREY: The music's too loud.    What you say about angels?
FOUCHET: Forget the cop. Kill the girl!
BURNETT: Don't even think about it. (realizes) Julie?
JULIE: That's him!
LOWREY: No shit!
LOWREY: Lemme drive!
BURNETT: I'm driving.     Buckle up.
LOWREY: Hold that.
LOWREY: C'mon, lemme drive --
BURNETT: Do I backseat drive when you're tailing a hitman?
BURNETT: There goes our only lead to the dope. We better call Howard.
JULIE: That's it. That's it.   You're both crazy.
JULIE: Protect and serve. Sound familiar? Isn't that what you're supposed to do? 'Cuz I'd like to know whose butt you're protecting.
JULIE: All you care about is getting your dope back. No, that's not all, you care about getting it back in a way that shows how fucking macho and tough you are. It's all some big testosterone contest. Well, fuck that.
LOWREY: Hey, hey. Just relax! (looks for words) Okay. It's true this whole thing started with missing drugs. But somebody I cared about. A lot. She got killed. And I'm not gonna lay down until this guy is dead or put away... And I promise you, we'll take care of you.
JULIE: That's what I'm afraid of.
LOWREY: Hey. What do I gotta say?     I need you, okay? (then for real) I need you.
LOWREY: Nah. Some smooth shit I got on my own.
BURNETT: Jesus.   What kinda shit was in there?
LOWREY: Smells like some kinda chemical.
BURNETT: We'll get a sample and drop it back at the lab. Meanwhile, why don't you two go on back to Club Hell and see what you can dig up on these bad guys.
LOWREY: One day, bro.    Gotta get yourself some of them.
LOWREY: Hey, hey.   That's not cryin' I hear.
THERESA: (wipes tears) Oh, it's nothing... I just bought some clothes. It's been so long since I bought anything nice... I just wanted something to wear for Marcus when he got home. But nothing looks right... (starts crying again) He's slipping away from me, Mike. I can feel it.
LOWREY: (sits next to her) Theresa. Listen to me. Nobody's slipping away from you. Especially not Marcus. You can take my word on that... As for the clothes...
LOWREY: Okay. Just a minor fashion faux paux. Those cappuccinos at lunch can do that to you... See what else we got here.
JULIE (O.S.): I'm really sorry about the dog pee. They must be traumatized by the new surroundings. I'll pay for new cushions.
JULIE: So, Mike.   Can I ask you something?
BURNETT: Sure.
JULIE: Do you always come to bed with your clothes on? Or just when there's a woman in it?
BURNETT: I'm on protective duty. And I want you to feel... protected. So I'm dressed and ready. It's okay. I've done it before.
JULIE: Really. You think Marcus would wear clothes to bed while on protective duty?
BURNETT: Sure he would. It's a cop thing.
JULIE: Oh, I definitely have a cop thing, too.
BURNETT: You do?
JULIE: Well Marcus. He's very   something ... sexy. And the way I   came in tonight, he was throwing  everybody this way and that and he  took control.
BURNETT: Well, I drove.
JULIE: I know.   You drove well.
BURNETT: I shot the gas tank on the car.
BURNETT: Theresa.   Why?
JULIE: I'll bet Theresa is takin' care of business right now.
BURNETT: What's that supposed to mean?
JULIE: You know, relieve his tension. A woman'll do anything to keep a man like that. You know what I mean? Tonight... made me a little bit horny, I guess. I think, maybe. It was the car chase. Or the guns and everything. I've never shot a gun before. Maybe it's the steel or something. I'm feeling a little... funny.
BURNETT: Funny?
JULIE: I don't know.    Do you feel a little funny?
BURNETT: Yeah... I feel a little funny.
JULIE: Not that kind of funny.
BURNETT: What kind of funny?
JULIE: You know... (rubs him) Funny.
BURNETT: I gotta call Marcus.
LOWREY: That's right.    Turn around.
THERESA: You think he'll like it? I mean, I want him to, you know, want to...
LOWREY: Want to? Baby. Someone I know's gonna burn you right to the ground. Get ready! (then, into phone) You're on the mic with Mike... Hello?
JULIE: Usually the guy throws me out after he fucks me.
BURNETT: I'm different. I'm a cop.     And now I gotta kill a guy.
KIDS: G'night, Uncle Mike.
THERESA: Yeah.   Good night, Uncle Mike.
LOWREY: G'night, everybody.
LOWREY: Hey, Sanchez. It's me Lowrey... Yeah? Same to you, pal. But listen. I got something you'll want a piece of.
BURNETT: I got some jewelry for you.
JULIE: You prick! First you don't want me. Then you drag me out...
BURNETT: Just shut the fuck up. I won't be long. Try and keep out of sight.
CASPER: There's our guy. Watch him.
THERESA: Mike!
LOWREY: What's the matter?
THERESA: I heard a noise... I think someone's outside...
LOWREY: Marcus!   What the fuck --
BURNETT: ... You doin' Theresa?    Theresa!
LOWREY: What?   Me and Theresa?
BURNETT: I hope you used protection... 'cause I don't want a fourth kid that looks like you!
FERGUSON: Wanna explain what this shit's about?
LOWREY: This whole deal has turned you stupid. You're seeing things that aren't there.
THERESA (O.S.): Mike?   Are you okay!
LOWREY: I'm fine, Theresa! (whispers) Will you get the hell out of here before she sees you! You're supposed to be in Cleveland.
BURNETT: Yeah, I wouldn't want to spoil your little arrangement!
LOWREY: And where's Julie? You didn't leave her again.
BURNETT: She's in the car. Got her cuffed to the steering wheel.
LOWREY: (through grit teeth) Now, listen to me. Look over my right shoulder. What do you see ... I said look!
BURNETT: (looks) Late model Ford. Two occupants.
LOWREY: Good. So who do you think's in there? Ed McMahon come to tell us we're sweepstakes winners?
BURNETT: Okay.   What are we doing about it?
LOWREY: We're doing nothing. I've got it handled. In the meantime, you better get back to where you belong before I shoot you myself.
CASPER: Sonofabitch!   There's the girl!
FERGUSON: What the fuck?
SANCHEZ: Let's go!
CHET: 'Evening, Mr. Lowrey. May I have a word with you? (pulls him aside) I was thinking that... maybe I could see your gun. See, we don't allow guns up in the apartments. Mr. Lowrey usually checks his, here, at the desk with me... You want me to check yours?
CHET: Oh, okay.   It's just an option.
BURNETT: Hey.   What's goin' on here?
LOWREY: Wait a minute. That's my desk!
SANCHEZ: He says he wants his lawyer.
RUIZ: Yeah, but we told him we were desperate men without no fuckin' jobs, so... (prods the guy) So?
HENCHMAN: Okay. All I know is his name. Foo-shay, I think. Got this heavy French accent. The word was he offs drug dealers. And there was quick cash for whoever had the balls enough to hook up with him. I swear, man, watchin' your house was my first gig for the guy.
BURNETT: Yeah. I guess you're tellin' the truth.
HOWARD: I also got the lab report from the stuff you picked up in Noah's trunk.
BURNETT: Yeah, but Julie told me his ship comes in on Friday? You wanna tell me who can cut a hundred mil worth a dope in five days? You'd need whole lotta time cards to make that kinda date.
LOWREY: Or one really smart sonofabitch.
HOWARD: We're    in the shit, boys. And there    ain't gonna be any more time cards    for this unit unless somebody pulls    a miracle out of their ass.
JULIE: I'm getting really tired of this shit!
BURNETT: Hey, Jojo.
LOWREY: Good runnin' into you, Jojo.
BURNETT: Hey, calm down. A little rap, that's all. We're lookin' for someone who can step on a shitload of heroin. And do it real fast, and real well. We're lookin' for a pro.
JOJO: I'm in the rubber business now.
BURNETT: We're not playin' around with you, Jojo. You know what we want.
JOJO: I'm tellin' you straight up, like a straight fuckin' arrow, okay? I'm straight as a board. I'm so straight it's fuckin' sick.
BURNETT: Now there's a lotta dope, Jojo. Who can cut it quick?
JOJO: You mean, cut it... cut it up, yeah. I don't know anything about anything.
BURNETT: What are you doin', man?
LOWREY                           BURNETT: back)
LOWREY                           BURNETT: (then, back to                   (as he walks away) Jojo)                        I'm sorry for you, Jojo. fragments or brain shit on me. When that shit flies, it don't wash off.
BURNETT: (chimes in again) Remember, partner. He's no good to us if you splatter his ass.
LOWREY: (holsters guns) Man, it's a good thing you got your memory workin'. Cuz that dead man paperwork is a bitch.
JULIE: So where's the coffee and donuts?
BURNETT: What?
JULIE: I thought that was the usual menu when cops were on stakeout. A little caffeine for the heart. Some sugar-coated dough fried in day old grease.
LOWREY: Man. Will you get off this? You're making me sick.
JULIE: Oh, I'm sorry, Marcus. All     these hours on the case, you must    miss Theresa's home cooking. (near Lowrey's ear) Bet last night she fixed you    up something yummy and left it    in the microwave for you.
LOWREY: Yeah.   Somethin' yummy.
JULIE: I imagine there was something yummy waiting for you when you finally made it to bed --
BURNETT: (wheels) Listen, lady --
LOWREY: Oh, man.     It's the fuckin' pretend police.
TOWNE: Well, what do we have back here? Looks like we got us two pimps and a hooker.
DE SOUZA: Hey, fellahs. Maybe if she does us both we'll let you leave with your pride intact.
LOWREY: Excuse me. One moment. (rolls up the window) Let's fuck with these bozos.
LOWREY: Now, where were we?
TOWNE: Outta the car. Hands where we can see 'em. Feet spread.
BURNETT: Oh, that's not how you frisk a potential lawbreaker. You gotta start at the waistband. See if he's carrying a piece.
TOWNE: Gun!
LOWREY: (slowly turns) Now I'm reaching slowly for my shield... very slowly... here it comes... just about got it... (reveals his badge) Ooh, look at that. It's a detective's shield! All gold and shiny. A smart fellah wouldn't fuck with somebody who had one of these in his pocket. So... Let's see. I guess that makes us policemen. And you...
BURNETT: Not.
BURNETT: Now, some rent-a-cops have licenses to carry weapons,  where others do not. Which might   you be? You wouldn't happen to   have those permits handy, would  you?
JULIE: Guess we know the answer to that one.
BURNETT: I bet you miss your wife, kids... I bet you miss them a whole lot.
LOWREY: I don't worry. They're in good hands.
SANCHEZ: Are you kidding, man? Desi was the brains behind the whole operation. That's why they called their company Desilu. Desi was first. Lucy second. Get it? Desi-Lu?
BURNETT: Two o'clock.     The red Civic.
LOWREY: I'm on him. (to Julie) Hey, buckle up back there.
JULIE: Wha...?
BURNETT: Yeah. Tell Howard to assemble the troops. We just made the dope lab. We'll be at the P.D. in one hour.
JULIE: So what am I gonna do?
LOWREY: You're gonna keep your sweet ass nice and quiet back at my place.
JULIE: What?
LOWREY: Mike's place.     I said Mike's.
QUINCY: Hey, it's Dad and Uncle Mike.
NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.): In our continuing report on police violence, the most recent incident involving two Miami P.D. officers remains unexplained by department spokesmen. This high-speed chase was captured two nights ago by our Live Copter 9 news team. And while the driver was killed, both police officers involved in the incident seemed to escape without injury.
THERESA: Kids, you go over to the neighbors' house. I'll be right back.
THERESA: Mommy's going to Cleveland.
CHET: Lady, all visitors must be announced.
THERESA: Announce this!
JULIE: So, I guess when you get back, it's gonna be over.
LOWREY: That's the plan... So, Mike. Loan some of those ass kicking clothes.
BURNETT: Third drawer down. (as doorbell rings) Hey, Julie. Do me a favor and see who that is.
JULIE: Which one do you want?     The tall one or the short one?
THERESA: Oh, I got plenty in me to kill 'em both. But it's the short one I'm gonna divorce.
JULIE: Thought so.
LOWREY: Man, I can't wait to see the look on Howard's face when we tell him... (seeing Theresa) Holy shit! Hi, Theresa... honey.
THERESA: Save your crap, Mike.
LOWREY: Mike what?     What'd he do?
BURNETT: Theresa.     It's not how it looks.
THERESA: It ain't Cleveland, neither.
LOWREY: Where's Julie?
LOWREY: Julie. We wanted to tell you... I especially wanted to tell you --
JULIE: You think I didn't know? God, you are so stupid! And to think I let you use me like you did, Max. Why?
LOWREY: Julie --
JULIE: Wait. I know why. Because you said you needed me. Jesus, who's the stupid one now?
LOWREY: We still need you.
JULIE: Fuck you!
THERESA: You stayed away from home just one night too many, Marcus.
BURNETT: Theresa. She's a material witness! It was orders!
FOUCHET: Grab her.
LOWREY: Julie!   Drop now!
FOUCHET: Let's go!
LOWREY: Julie!!!!
BURNETT: Go upstairs. And don't let anybody in but me... Do it!
THERESA: Marcus, I love you.
FOUCHET: Out of the car!
LOWREY: Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.
HOWARD: It's about fuckin' time.
BURNETT: We lost the girl.
HOWARD: But you found the dope, right? So let's go get it back.
BOY: Which one of you's Lowrey?   I got somethin' for him.
LOWREY: At least I'm me again. (hand out) I'm Lowrey.
LOWREY: (presses send) Yeah.   This is Lowrey.
FOUCHET: That bullet just killed the chemist. Now, I have but four hours left to make my deal. Fuck with my timetable and the next bullet kills the girl.
LOWREY: You twisted motherfucker... (then...) Jojo, you sonofabitch. When I get my hands on you, I swear, I'm gonna kill you. (hangs up) The snitch who tipped us to the dope lab? Turns out to be a bogus address.
BURNETT: Bogus address?
HOWARD: How's this? I'll kill the little prick for you. That's cuz you're already dead. (waves at the troops) Okay, you guys. Put 'em back in the lockers.
BURNETT: How'd he know we were gearing up to go? It's like he's known all along where we're gonna be and when.
LOWREY: You know that once he sells the dope, he's gonna kill her just like he did Max.
BURNETT: Three little angels. Julie kept talking about his three little angels.
LOWREY: If she dies, I'm done with it. The whole cop thing.
BURNETT: (looking at his kids) Three little angels.
FRANCINE: Hey, fellahs. What's the joke. (as she gets nothing back) Really. I want to know.
FRANCINE: It was a birthday party... You know, after hours. Just the civilian staff... We were drinking. And everybody. They all had boy friends or their husbands.
LOWREY: So you were alone?
FRANCINE: He was so nice to me. He said I was beautiful, too. I guess I wanted to believe him... (then ashamed, starting to shake) He took some horrible pictures of me. I don't remember any of it. I'd had too much to drink. I wondered if he'd drugged me. Later... he threatened to show them to my boys... my little angels. Said he'd pin the pictures up on the grade school bulletin boards for all their classmates to see if I didn't do what he wanted.
BURNETT: He wanted someone inside the P.D.?
FRANCINE: At first, it was about drug busts. Dealers under surveillance.
(MORE): He'd steal from them before we could make the case. And then when the department gave the air conditioning to Mr. Orona...
BURNETT: Anything you can tell us about him?
FRANCINE: What do you say about someone who rips off drug dealers? A man like that ain't scared of nobody. Not the police. Not you guys. Nobody. (beat) He's the scariest man I ever met.
LOWREY: Yeah. But does he still trust what you tell him?
FOUCHET: Yes?
FRANCINE: I have some more information for you, Mr. Fouchet.
FOUCHET: Yes, Francine... What is it?
FRANCINE: Miami P.D.'s called in the D.E.A. task force. They know the deal's going down in just two hours. So they've deployed agents to every point of entry, airports, marinas, etc...
FOUCHET: Is that all?
FRANCINE: Yes.
FOUCHET: I'm very pleased, Francine. You're the best pet I've ever had.
SANCHEZ: Got him! Ma Bell says as long as he keeps his cellular phone turned on, we can track him.
