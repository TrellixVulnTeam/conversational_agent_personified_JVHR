You will see I will tell you when the evidence is clear. Then you will have a story. My old friends will hear about themselves. ( stopping, freezing on that image, and )
MARSHALL: That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in Paris the day before yesterday. I'm sure most of you have a passing knowledge of Mr. Wombosi. Some of you on the African desks have worked with him over the years. Some of you very closely.
MARSHALL: .He was an irritation before he took power. He was a problem when he was in power. And he's been a disaster for us in exile. Wombosi likes to send us messages through the European media. This is an interview we pulled down from a local German television station in Dresden. We've been getting these little broadsides every couple of months. He knows this he knows that he's writing a book about the Agency's history in Africa he's going to name names. It's basically a shakedown. This interview and I'll make the tape available for anyone who wants it he goes on to claim that he has just survived an assassination attempt. He says it's us. He says he's got proof. The overwhelming negative ramifications of this should be The Director wants to know if there is any possible shred of truth in this accusation.

CONKLIN: I thought you were never going to do
ABBOTT: They're putting together an agency oversight committee. They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger. What am I going to do about that?
CONKLIN: You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization. That it's all theoretical. You'd want to sign off on that.
ABBOTT: And what if I couldn't do that?
CONKLIN: Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far. Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it? We'll clean up the field. You clean up your budgets.

MARIE: What? Like amnesia?
BOURNE: Look, go ahead. put the radio on.
MARIE: ( total incredulity ) You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
BOURNE: That's what I'm saying.

MORGUE BOSS: ( French ) Okay, Monsieur Kane. number 121. Get the fuck out of my way ( pushing Deauvage aside )
WOMBOSI: Get the fuck out of my way
WOMBOSI: ( turning to Deauvage ) It's not him.
WOMBOSI: ( quiet hard fury ) So who's crazy now?
MARIE: And you have no idea not a clue what came before that?
BOURNE: When you think of it, before the ship before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
MARIE: When you think of it, before the ship before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
BOURNE: Nothing. It's just not there.
MARIE: Well, this is great. I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
BOURNE: I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could
MARIE: you could put it together
BOURNE: which was okay for a while, I was okay with it. But then there's all these other things all these other things I know how to do and this this stuff from the bank and. I think something bad happened.
MARIE: What are you talking about?
BOURNE: I don't know.
MARIE: Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
BOURNE: I was shot twice in the back.
MARIE: Okay, so you're a victim.
BOURNE: There was a gun. Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
MARIE: Lots of people have guns. You're American. Americans love guns.
BOURNE: I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall I went out the window and I was doing it I just did it. I knew how to do it.
MARIE: People do amazing things when they're Why do I? I come in here instinctively first thing I do I'm looking for the exit I'm catching the sightlines I know I can't sit with my back to the door
BOURNE: Why do I? I come in here instinctively first thing I do I'm looking for the exit I'm catching the sightlines I know I can't sit with my back to the door
MARIE: You're paranoid. You were shot. It's
BOURNE: I can tell you the license plate numbers of all three cars out front. I can tell you that the waitress is left-handed and the guy at the counter weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds and knows how to handle himself. I know that the best, first place to look for a gun is the cab of that grey truck outside. I know that at this altitude I can run flat out for half a mile before I lose my edge. I knew that you were my first, best option out of Zurich? How do I know all that? How can I know all that and not know who I am? How is that
MARIE: God, you're not kidding, are you?
CONKLIN: And that's the best angle of the That's the only angle.
CONKLIN: What do they have on the streets? The area. They must have something.
CONKLIN: Abbott. He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
ZORN: Abbott. He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
CONKLIN: That'll solve all our problems.
CONKLIN: ( turning back ) What's that?
CONKLIN: Enhance it.
FINALLY TO: WOMBOSI'S THRONE ROOM And there he is the emperor himself WOMBOSI on his throne. Except the room is dark and empty. And he's sitting there by himself. A king without a country. Sitting there. With a gun in his lap. Drinking hard from a bottle of Jack Daniels. EXT. FRENCH ROADSIDE DAWN Beautiful morning. The red car parked along the road. BOURNE alone in the passenger seat. Deep asleep. Nestled there. And then, he wakes suddenly. Starts. Freaked for a moment. Instantly feeling for the red bag. There it is in his lap. He looks around and MARIE sitting away from the car. She's got a loaf of bread. A soda. Smoking a butt. Same clothes, but her make-up's been washed away. Clean. Simple. Gorgeous. BOURNE steps out. Morning legs.
MARIE: I needed a break.
BOURNE: Where are we?
MARIE: We're about an hour away.
BOURNE: I can't believe I slept.
MARIE: You were tired. Here. For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast. So what do you dream about?
BOURNE: I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up. I don't think I smoke.
MARIE: You ever think maybe you have a I thought about it. I don't know.
BOURNE: I thought about it. I don't know.
MARIE: I guess it's like Christmas every day for you, huh?
ABBOTT: Who is she?
ZORN: Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty- six. Born outside Munich. Father was a welder. He died in '91. We don't have the mother. There might be a step-sister, we're trying to track that down. It's tough. She's a wanderer. She pops up on the grid here and there but. I mean, the last time she paid an electric bill in Europe was '94. No taxes. No steady employer. She's got three arrests. Two shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one in Germany. And she actually did three months in an Italian detention center for credit card fraud.
ABBOTT: No political affiliations?
CONKLIN: She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's a great one.
ABBOTT: I'm assuming we're exploring that We're exploring every possibility. We are in pursuit. How much more do you want me to tell you?
CONKLIN: We're exploring every possibility. We are in pursuit. How much more do you want me to tell you?
ABBOTT: Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
CONKLIN: No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is.
ABBOTT: Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem. I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
CONKLIN: We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been sleeping down here. We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? now that we finally have something to work with you want to bring planning personnel down here? I'd rethink that.
ABBOTT: I want a second opinion.
CONKLIN: This is an operations desk.
ABBOTT: I'm not asking.
BOURNE: Slow down. No, don't stop. Just.
MARIE: ( looking over ) That's it? Is that it?
BOURNE: Four-fifty. That's the address.
MARIE: Looks familiar?
BOURNE: ( staring back as they pass ) No. Go around. Keep going.
MARIE: Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.
BOURNE: Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.
MARIE: So this is it, right?
BOURNE: I guess.
MARIE: I should go.
BOURNE: I don't remember any of this.
MARIE: He turns back. She's staring at him.
BOURNE: Sorry. The money, right?
MARIE: Okay, so.
BOURNE: Thanks for the ride.
MARIE: Silence. That moment. He focuses. Getting it.
BOURNE: Look, I don't know what's up there.
MARIE: You got me pretty fucking curious.
BOURNE: Look, you could come up. Or you could wait if you want. I could go check it out. You could wait.
MARIE: ( hide the pain ) With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
BOURNE: How could I forget about you? You're the only person I know.
MARIE: I guess you're not home.
CONCIERGE: ( opening the door ) Mr. Bourne, there you are I was wondering I haven't seen you
BOURNE: Here I am.
BOURNE: ( he tries a smile ) I seem to have lost my key.
CONCIERGE: I've been ringing your bell. It's good you were away. We had some trouble with the hot water. It's been repaired.
BOURNE: Great. We could use a shower. It was a long drive.
MARIE: It's big.
MARIE: This is like a real apartment. This is really yours?
BOURNE: I guess so.
THE BEDROOM: MARIE in the doorway. Checking it out. It's so clean and simple. But it's not the decor she's most interested in. MARIE opening an armoire. Nothing but men's clothes. No competition. She's feeling better by the moment as we go to
THE KITCHEN: Like a stage set. Lots of props and no sign of food. BOURNE picking up a frying pan.
BOURNE: This is my frying pan. This is my spoon. I'm Jason Bourne and this is my
MARIE: This is your office? God, you live like a monk.
BOURNE: All this stuff it's all about I think I'm in the shipping business.
MARIE: See. It's starting to come back, You mind if I take a bath?
BOURNE: Go ahead.
PHONE MACHINE: "You have no messages."
BOURNE: .yes oui uh.

BOURNE: .I understand.
BOURNE: Who? Who came?
BOURNE: Right. Yes. Of course.
BOURNE: Do you his brother do you have a phone number?
MARIE: ( calling out to him ) She wasn't kidding about the water. It's freezing.
THE OFFICE: BOURNE frozen there. On alert. He forces a smile. Decoy mood.
BOURNE: Hang on. I'll check the kitchen. Maybe it takes a while to get all the way upstairs.
THE KITCHEN: BOURNE moving to the sink. He's smiling. Upbeat. But it's an act. His eyes are everywhere. Turning on the water. But ignoring it. What he's really doing is searching out a weapon. Pulling A KNIFE very quietly from behind the stove. Holding it. Feels pretty comfortable. Hiding it down by his side. On the move again, now
BOURNE: Yeah, it's cold in here, too. Let's give it another minute. what're you? no no
MARIE: ( suddenly ) ( she's behind him ) what're you? no no
BOURNE: no Marie no! it's not like that

THE WINDOW: CASTEL hurling himself into the glass and
THE CONCIERGE: ( still outside the door ) I'm calling the police, Mr. Bourne you give me no choice I'm calling them right away!
BOURNE: your shoes Marie! where? where are your shoes? Marie He's dead isn't he?

BOURNE: You're wrong. I didn't know.
MARIE: I don't trust anybody and I trusted I didn't know this would happen.
BOURNE: I didn't know this would happen.
MARIE: He had my picture! He knew I was here! He came here to kill us!
BOURNE: And where is he now? You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
MARIE: ( totally overwhelmed ) Oh, Jesus.
BOURNE: You stay if you want, you stay it's okay it's better maybe it's better I don't know But I can't stay here. I can't.
MARIE: But the police

MARIE: there's two of us we'll tell them we'll just
BOURNE: forget it
MARIE: we'll tell them what happened
BOURNE: I don't know what happened! I don't know who he is! I don't know what he wants! I don't even know who I am! The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find
BOURNE: Come with me. I can get us out of here. I know it. Then we can think. Then we can work it out. We'll explain it then. Once we're safe. I can protect you.
WOMBOSI: No! I say, no! they go this far out a body in the grave another body! no! this isn't over these people are not finished nothing will make them finish until they have Wombosi! the real Wombosi until I'm the one in the box!
WOMBOSI: what are you doing? he's sleeping! this man is sleeping at his post! I've had men killed for this! you think these people? these people who come for me you think they sleep? they never sleep! they spend all the day all the night all time thinking about how to put Wombosi in that box!
WOMBOSI: there is no box for Wombosi! they don't have a box that can hold me! I know these people I know they never sleep! I know they never stop! they never stop until the knife is at their throat! what is the window? this window is open! who leaves this open! this is a war, you fool! you think these people are like you? you think this is stupid people? careless people? these people see an open window, they reach in with a big hand and grab your heart until you die!

DEAUVAGE: Yes, sir. All clear.
WOMBOSI: This man is out there. Kane is out there. And they pretend he's dead. That means he's coming back.
MRS. DOYLE: He's not lying. He's very highly stressed, but he's not lying. He's confused. He's aggressively searching for a way out of the chaos. This conversation, the video from the consulate the body language, vocal pattern it's my sense he's really lost here. I think he snapped.
CONKLIN: Is that a medical term?
MRS. DOYLE: You want clinical terminology? It's called, "conversation hysteria." I don't know exactly how you train these people. I'm not sure I want to know. I'll take a guess there's some extremely rigorous behavior modification going on here.
ABBOTT: Let's assume that's true.
MRS. DOYLE: You can only wind people so tight. Even machines break down.
CONKLIN: This unit has an unblemished record of success.
MRS. DOYLE: Then I guess I'm in the wrong meeting.
CONKLIN: That was two hours two hours to get a second opinion and nothing changes. He's loose. He's out of control. It's very clear what needs to happen. I have work to do.
ABBOTT: What if he is working for someone else? What if he turned?
CONKLIN: Turn? To who? Where does he turn? What does he have to offer? He's got nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
BOURNE: ( he won't do it ) You know who you are. You know what that's worth? That's everything. ( pause ) I can't live like this. I can't do anything until I know who I am. Believe me, you don't want what I

TELEPHONE VOICE: This is an answering service, sir. The company's located in Southampton,
BOURNE: this is a tire dealership, right?
TELEPHONE VOICE: No sir, this is a navigational chart registry. I'm afraid you have the wrong number.
BOURNE: Hey, so this is the Marina, right?
NEW VOICE: Yes, sir. Can I help you?
BOURNE: ( he's got the number ) This is the one in Marseille, right?
NEW VOICE: ( Last time I looked. )
CONKLIN: let's check that Interpol window I'm on it
CONKLIN: I want that red car the girl we gotta get lucky here
ABBOTT: ( sitting there tensely ) We can't risk it.
CONKLIN: Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago. Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge. This is it. He's trained conditioned they're built to disappear. You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
ABBOTT: This doesn't go upstairs.
RAWLINS: Mr. Kane. Come right in. please. have a
BOURNE: BOURNE just trying to feel his way through this.
RAWLINS: ( really thrown ) I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really I was quite I was surprised.
BOURNE: We thought you were gone for good.
RAWLINS: We thought you were gone for good.
BOURNE: Did you?
RAWLINS: Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it? Cutthroat.
RAWLINS: ( finally ) Look, our bid it was competitive but definitely at the high end of competitive when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit ( pitching now ) I'm assuming you're still in the market. It's the same vessel?
BOURNE: We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more

BOURNE: Another beat. Rawlins holding back until now.
RAWLINS: Was it the break-in?
BOURNE: Excuse me?
RAWLINS: We also thought we hadn't heard from you we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking. Our offices were broken into vandalism mostly shortly after we last spoke.
BOURNE: I hadn't heard.

Rounds a bend, is chambering two rounds when he sees a WOMAN is in her kitchen staring at him no time to explain he turns back The PROFESSOR is just vaulting over the wall. BOURNE FIRES TWICE BAM! BAM! But the spray is too wide from this distance. Windows are shattered to both sides of him but the PROFESSOR stumbles but keeps going blood on his face now RATATAT BOURNE has to move. Reloading his almost useless gun. Reaching MARIE facing a choice and they climb a wall FLOWER POTS EXPLODE around them but they make it now RUNNING IN A LABYRINTH right then left through a small staircase. LEAPING a wall landing on a STEEP ROOF sliding, falling, crashing to the ground in A SMALL COURTYARD steep walls on all sides. But there's a large window and it's open.

CONKLIN: What did I do? What've you done? Do you have any idea? Any conception? What you've destroyed? Do you have any idea how much time and work how many people have their lives wrapped up in this?
BOURNE: Are you Treadstone?
CONKLIN: Am I Treadstone? Me? What the hell're you talking about?
BOURNE: What did you do to me?
CONKLIN: What did I do? I spent thirty million dollars on you. I spent three years finding you four years training What did I do? What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
BOURNE: I don't know.
CONKLIN: They're right about you, aren't they? You're fried. You really don't know what's going on, do you?

MARSHALL: All right, what's next?
ABBOTT: Okay, this is Blackbriar. Blackbriar is a joint, DOD, communications program that we really feel has good traction to it.
MARIE: Can I help you?
