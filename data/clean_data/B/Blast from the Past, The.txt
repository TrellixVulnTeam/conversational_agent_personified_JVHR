DAVE: Likes to cook. Pregnant.
RUTH: Normal, then.
BETTY: Well, I wouldn't go that far.
HELEN: Hi, Betty! Dave!
BETTY: Just look at you!
HELEN: Any day now!
BETTY: This is my sister and her husband.
HELEN: Oh, hi! Welcome!
CALVIN: So anyhow this duck says to the clerk, "I'd like to buy this lip balm." And the clerk says, "Will that be cash or a check?" And the duck says, "Just put it on my bill!"
DAVE: He was the golden-boy professor at Cal Tech. But then he starts inventing What kind of things?
BOB: What kind of things?
DAVE: You got me. Some kind of special synthetic rubber. And some kind of automated machine. Anyhow, suddenly he gets rich. I mean rich! And quits
CALVIN: How's that?
GUEST: Just what the doctor ordered!
BETTY: With all his money they could have moved to Beverly Hills, but they decided to stay in the Valley. Calvin spends all his time tinkering out there in his workshop. If you ask me it's all very strange.
CALVIN: There currently exists a type of neon light that lasts five years. But you won't see it on the market. Same is true of batteries. I could take your simple yacht battery and rig it to last a decade, easily.
HAROLD: Well, what the heck kind of a marketing system can't get great new products like that out to the public?
CALVIN: ( intense ) A veeeery good one, Harold. Free market capitalism may not be a perfect order, but it's the best we've got, or will ever have. And why? Three

TOWER: Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
JFK: .we will not prematurely or unnecessarily risk the cost of worldwide nuclear war, in which even the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouth. But neither will we shrink from the risk at any time it must be faced.
CALVIN: I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime.I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
HELEN: We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a

CALVIN: I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
HELEN: Cheese is particularly troublesome.
CALVIN: Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
HELEN: Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember Yeah, yeah. Okay. Give me the roast and watch your step. I'll come back for the radio.

HELEN: How long will we have to stay down I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
CALVIN: I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
HELEN: Rather safe than sorry. That's my But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
CALVIN: Rather safe than sorry. That's my But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
HELEN: But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.

A MONTAGE: of Adam on another bus. He looks frantically out the window. We see his POV of shops and stores and people. At one point he sees two women joggers which he wonders about. Then he sees two men arguing violently. Gradually late day turns to night and Adam becomes more and more depressed. Then he sees something. He is elated. He jumps up and tells the driver:
ADAM: Driver! Stop this bus immediately! Please sir!!
ANOTHER ANGLE: of him as he passes a BODY PIERCING STORE and wonders about that. Then he sees something that blows his mind.

ADAM: It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
ADAM: I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
TROY: Almost all of them.
ADAM: The recovery is very impressive.
TROY: The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
ADAM: Amazing. I'm very impressed.
TROY: Well, what do you think?
EVE: I think.it.works.
TROY: Let me show you the entire trousseau!
ADAM: But first let me show her these! Eve, can I skate around your block?
TROY: ( making it sexual ) How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
EVE: ( beat, then )
EVE: He's going to kill himself. Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
ADAM: He heads out of the band shell. We follow him as he skates into an area that has been given over to the homeless. They sit around in their sleeping bags and blankets and cheer ( and jeer ) Adam when he passes by. He takes them to be more mutants.
EVE: That water's freezing!
TROY: He's from Alaska.
TROY: That's why little things mean so much to him.
ADAM: I LOVE THIS!!
TROY: ( defensive ) What?! He wanted to hear some
ADAM: I get it! I finally get it! You have to see it to understand it!
ADAM: Hey, Eve!
EVE: Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
ADAM: ( then watching the rain hit You know, my father who is a scientist says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
EVE: Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
ADAM: I certainly do!
EVE: Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
ADAM: ( rising ) No it's not!
EVE: Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean.
ADAM: Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
EVE: Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something
ADAM: ( taking her by the arms ) Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
EVE: Well.yeah. Okay.
ADAM: Thank Q, Eve! Why did you park way back there?
ADAM: Why did you park way back there?
TROY: Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
ADAM: Oh. I see.
TROY: Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
ADAM: Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
ADAM: My goodness gracious! This place is Look unimpressed.
EVE: Look unimpressed.
TROY: Bored even.
TROY: Vaguely bored!
EVE: Unimpressed, but still interested.
EVE: No! Not crazy!
ADAM: Do I look crazy?
EVE: Be loose.
TROY: Be loose.
EVE: Just be yourself.
TROY: Always good advice.
EVE: For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
ADAM: Holy Mo-ly, Miss Pay-o-ly!! This place is neat-o!!
EVE: Jason, Jonathan, this is Adam! Adam, that's them!
ADAM: How do you do?! It's very nice to meet you, Jason and Jonathan! My mother always told me that if you meet a person for the first time it's easier to remember their names if you use those names right away.
TROY: He's from Alaska!
SOPHIE: Hi, there, Eve, who's the hunk?
EVE: Get lost, Sophie.
SOPHIE: Hi. I'm Sophie.
ADAM: Hello, Sophie, I'm Adam Webber.
JASON: Adam lives in Alaska.
SOPHIE: No shit?
ADAM: Tu parle Francais? Tu a un tres bon You speak beautiful French! J'ai habitÈ a Paris un an.
SOPHIE: You speak beautiful French! J'ai habitÈ a Paris un an.
ADAM: Paris!! La ville de lumieres! C'est bien rencontrer quelqu'un pour pratiquer le francais.
SOPHIE: Si tu veux, nous pouvons pratiquer beaucoup des choses ensemble. Quit showing off! We're here on Non, cherie. A bientot.
EVE: Quit showing off! We're here on Non, cherie. A bientot.
ADAM: Non, cherie. A bientot.
SOPHIE: Non, cherie. A bientot.
ADAM: I thought I was here to meet women.
EVE: Not that one!
ADAM: I like her.
EVE: And don't be so obvious!
EVE: What have you ordered?
ADAM: It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
ADAM: Why?! I think she's very attractive.
EVE: Adam! She's got bitch written all over her! You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
ADAM: Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that! Or why Cliff would say that about you.
EVE: Because we're bitches! Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails. Please!
ADAM: How 'bout this one?
EVE: Are you kidding?! You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table! You don't see that?!
TROY: Well, I'm trying to educate him! It's nothing personal.
EVE: Well, I'm trying to educate him! It's nothing personal.
TROY: Adam, I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
ADAM: Okay. I like that.
EVE: ( swigging her drink ) Yeah, sweet. That's a nice way of putting it.
ADAM: ( to Troy ) What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
TROY: Um. Eve?
EVE: It's not so much what you say but how you say it. Women like men who are Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have. Same with guys. That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
ADAM: Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have. Same with guys. That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
EVE: Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have. Same with guys. That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
ADAM: That's ridiculous.
EVE: Maybe. But that's how it works.
TROY: Ah-ha! There's " Miss Sweet." At the hors d'oeuvres table!
EVE: Yeah. Could be. Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
ADAM: ( very serious ) Okay. All right. ( then ) And what do I say?
EVE: Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
TROY: Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
ADAM: Okay. Thank you, my friends. By the way, that's a great play.
EVE: Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
ADAM: Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
EVE: Did you?
TROY: I'm not sure I want to watch this.
ADAM: ( to himself ) Surprising and funny. Well, I know a duck who bought some lip balm.
ADAM: MISS SWEET ( not sweet ) ( beat, then ) MISS SWEET
MISS SWEET: ( not sweet ) ( beat, then ) I was wondering if you might help me. I.I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here. Oh, now, that's a great one!
ADAM: ( beat, then ) I was wondering if you might help me. I.I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here. Oh, now, that's a great one!
MISS SWEET: Oh, now, that's a great one!
ADAM: ( big smile ) You like it?
MISS SWEET: ( a little clap )
ADAM: They both laugh.
MISS SWEET: This is my new friend.
ADAM: I'm Adam Webber.
MISS SWEET: He's really funny!
HEATHER: Hi! I'm Heather!
ADAM: "Heather?" I don't believe I've ever heard that name before.
HEATHER: Yeah, right!
MISS SWEET: I told you! He's funny!
MISS SWEET: We work on Rodeo Drive. But we're both professional dancers.
ADAM: You dance?
HEATHER: You dance?
ADAM: I took a dance lesson everyday of my life until a couple of days ago.
MISS SWEET: You're kidding!
ADAM: No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
MISS SWEET: Your mom was a dancer?
ADAM: She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we
MISS SWEET: They head for the dance floor.
TROY: You know, he's a very, very good
EVE: Shut up!
TROY: Must you. What in the hell is wrong with you?!!
TROY: What in the hell is wrong with you?!!
MISS SWEET: Is that your girl friend?
ADAM: No. Would you please excuse me?
HEATHER: If you'll please come back.
ADAM: I will certainly try. And thank you both very much for the dance.
MISS SWEET: When was the last time you saw manners like that?
HEATHER: Yeah. It's like meeting a foreigner or something.
EVE: ( to Troy ) Go to the bathroom.
TROY: Right here? Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't
ADAM: You wanted to see me!
EVE: You're not from Alaska! Where'd you learn to dance like that?! And there are no starving people, are there?!
ADAM: Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
EVE: Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
ADAM: I've never lied to you. I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
EVE: You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't No. I admire you. I.I fell in love with you the first time I saw you. I did. I think that you are the most
ADAM: No. I admire you. I.I fell in love with you the first time I saw you. I did. I think that you are the most
EVE: I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
ADAM: All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962
ADAM: Hello, Cliff, how are you this
CLIFF: Not bad.
CLIFF: But I do miss that green sport coat of Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just
ADAM: Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just
CLIFF: ( to Eve ) How 'bout a drink at the bar?
EVE: ( pause, then )
CLIFF: It's all yours.
EVE: So where is your roommate, the model?
CLIFF: You know, I don't know. And looking at you, I don't care. It's been too long, Eve.
CLIFF: Oh, brother.
ADAM: Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
CLIFF: I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair. Well, isn't he? And shallow, as well?
ADAM: I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair. Well, isn't he? And shallow, as well?
CLIFF: ( the shallowest guy in the Shallow? I'm shallow?!
EVE: Go home, Adam. Go to your hotel.
CLIFF: Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
ADAM: Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
CLIFF: Do ya?
EVE: Stop it, you two!
CLIFF: ( slightly insecure ) I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
ADAM: ( lowering his guard ) Yes, I agree. I'm sorry.
EVE: I'm sorry.
ADAM: I'm sorry.
CLIFF: ( increasingly insecure ) Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
ADAM: ( lowering his guard ) It certainly is. I agree with you Eve? I'm leaving.
CLIFF: Eve? I'm leaving.
EVE: I don't blame you!
ADAM: ( turning to Eve ) Eve, I'm sorry.
CLIFF: ( deeply insecure ) Well, good night, everyone.
EVE: I'm leaving, too.
ADAM: But, Eve, I would
EVE: And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you outbecause I quit! This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm
EVE: He go back to the hotel?
TROY: Uh..he might of.
EVE: What's that mean?
TROY: We did not leave together.
EVE: Who did he leave with?
TROY: What's it to you?!
EVE: I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
TROY: Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp. You tell me.
EVE: Those sluts!
TROY: Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
EVE: Where are you going?
TROY: To bed.
EVE: To bed?
TROY: Yeah. I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
EVE: What?! Now hold on! Wait one damn
EVE: In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
TROY: Yes, you do.
EVE: And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
TROY: Uh, yes, you do.
EVE: Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
TROY: Yes, you do!
EVE: Or have perfect table manners.
TROY: ( sitting up ) You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior. ( then ) Know what else he told me?
EVE: ( sitting on the bed ) He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
TROY: He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
EVE: Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
TROY: Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses.
EVE: Where did he get all that information?
TROY: From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
EVE: So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
TROY: He didn't leave with them.
EVE: Well.I admit it. I'm glad to hear He left with Sophie.
TROY: He left with Sophie.
EVE: It's true. She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
TROY: It's true. She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
EVE: Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
TROY: What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
EVE: You're goddamn right I am! You coming?!
TROY: ( cringing ) I don't think so.
EVE: She exits.
TROY: Gentleman coward, to you.
EVE: Come on! Come on, damn it!
ADAM: Eve SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as she throws open her door and jumps out into the street where she falls down, hurting her knee. Adam runs around the car to help her to her feet. Dogs start barking in several houses.
ADAM: Scare me, why don't you?!!? You stupid son of a bitch!!!
EVE: Scare me, why don't you?!!? You stupid son of a bitch!!!
ADAM: I'm really sorry!
EVE: What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
ADAM: I know.and I'm really sorry.
EVE: Well, you should be! Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
ADAM: Eve marches, with a limp, back to the house.
EVE: Eve marches, with a limp, back to the house.
ADAM: Eve, if you'll let me, I can
EVE: Look! I'm limping! How attractive is that?! What if this is for life?!
ADAM: I know first aid!
EVE: Well, you had better!!
EVE: Wait a minute.
EVE: He takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the antiseptic to her knee with the other. It stings and she He leans down and blows on the wound. CU of that. CU of his hand on her calf. CU of her looking down at him, watching as he blows gently on her knee.
ADAM: He takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the antiseptic to her knee with the other. It stings and she He leans down and blows on the wound. CU of that. CU of his hand on her calf. CU of her looking down at him, watching as he blows gently on her knee.
ADAM: Steady. Steady. It's going to be all right in no time.
ADAM: I went to Sophie's and she was very Is that what you call it?
EVE: Is that what you call it?
ADAM: But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi. But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel. There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live." You know it?
EVE: Sing it to me.
ADAM: ( softly, saying it as much as "All at once am Iseveral stories high knowing I'mon the street where you live." It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves. Adam.dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
EVE: Adam.dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
ADAM: She sits up.
EVE: How is that possible? In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on Los Angeles, my parents were in our fallout shelter. That's where I was born. We only survived because it was a huge shelter as fallout shelters go. My father worked on it secretly for years. When he had to, he used contractors, but always from out-of- state and always for just a portion of the job. He told them it was a secret government experiment done through CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he felt in this case he had no choice. Of course, it had to be a secret, because we had just enough supplies to last three people thirty-five years. That's also why I have no brothers or sisters. The air vent was the really tricky part, but he was able to cut into a flood control sewer. What I'd like to do Eve, is take you down into the fallout shelter with me. We could live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad said if I found a healthy girl I should "bring her on down". And you look plenty healthy to me.

EVE: Uh-huh. Adam?
ADAM: Yes, Eve?
EVE: I want you to go back to the hotel now. I'll call you a cab.
ADAM: Of course. I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
EVE: That's right. And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby. Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
ADAM: Not at all. And Eve thank you for tonight.and for the kiss. My first.
EVE: My pleasure.
ADAM: It was at least as good as the sky.
EVE: Really? Okay!
ADAM: And I think better than the ocean. I'm Neat. Goodnight!
EVE: Neat. Goodnight!
TROY: Goddamn, Adam!
ADAM: Wait a minute!
TROY: I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I? I'm so sorry.
ADAM: No! There's an Adult Bookstore back there! I'll be right back!
TROY: Without question, the strangest man I've ever met.
SODA JERK: Give us a sign! That's all we ask! Give us some sort of sign!
ADAM: Okay, Troy! Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
TROY: How 'bout we check with Eve first?
ADAM: You bet!
TROY: So, did you buy a movie?
ADAM: A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
TROY: A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
ADAM: ( concentrating on his No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
TROY: ( laughing in agreement ) I know what you mean! I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
ADAM: Does that work?
TROY: Yeah.Seems to.
ADAM: Hi, Eve!
EVE: Hi, Adam. This is, uh..
ARON: I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
ADAM: How do you do?
ARON: Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
ADAM: Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
ARON: Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate Mr. Brown.
ADAM: He nods politely.
ARON: We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
ADAM: Come where?
ARON: My office.
ADAM: For how long?
ARON: Well, that depends.
ADAM: I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
EVE: Adam..you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing. The best thing for you. I promise.
ADAM: .All right, Eve. If you say so.
EVE: .I do.
ADAM: ( to Aron ) Could I please just go home? I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
ARON: Let's go talk first, Adam.
ADAM: Yes, ma'am.
TROY: Good-bye, Adam.
ADAM: Adam looks back at Eve, who looks away. Adam exits.
ARON: ( to Eve ) You'll be hearing from me.
EVE: Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
TROY: I know.I know. You did the right
EVE: Oh, no!
TROY: She runs out. He follows.
EVE: Oh, my God!
ARON: He'll catch him. Hi. This is Nina Aron. I've got a run away and I'm going to need police No! Not the police! Don't call them!
EVE: No! Not the police! Don't call them!
ARON: I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser
EVE: No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs
ARON: Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
EVE: You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
ARON: And now you must let me be the judge of that!
EVE: I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is.
ARON: Let's all remain calm. That's the key
ADAM: The key to my hotel room! I want you to have my baseball cards! And please be sure to pay my bill!
ARON: Young man, stop right there!
ARON: Stop, right now! Get out of that Adam, you really shouldn't try to drive that truck!
TROY: Adam, you really shouldn't try to drive that truck!
ADAM: ( starting the engine ) Bye, Troy!
TROY: Bye, Adam!
ADAM: And thanks for always being happy!
TROY: ( yelling to Adam ) Well, you're.certainly welcome!
EVE: ( yelling to Adam ) Well, you're.certainly welcome!
TROY: ( yelling to Adam ) Well, you're.certainly welcome!
ARON: Hey!!! That's my car, you son of a Where the hell have you been?!
BROWN: I fell down! What's the license number of that Don't ask them! They're as fucked-up as the other guy!
ARON: Don't ask them! They're as fucked-up as the other guy!
TROY: Let's all just try to remain calm. That's the key thing.
ARON: How 'bout I just knock the shit out of
TROY: I guess he took what he could.
EVE: ( putting her head in her Good God.you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
TROY: Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
ADAM: I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man.

CALVIN: You have something on your forehead.
SODA JERK: I know.
TROY: This it?
TROY: What do you want to do with it?
EVE: Give it back to him.
TROY: And if we can't find him?
EVE: We'll find him.
TROY: What's wrong?
EVE: I don't know. Everything's so neat. It's all just so.goddamn dear. See these? Found them in the box with the cards. These are stock certificates. IBM. AT&T. Polaroid. Ipana. I think I remember that brand. Oh, here, you should read this. "Trademark, 1961."

TROY: Thanks, Jason.
TROY: Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock! The clothes! The toothpaste! The guy was on the level! And you blew it! A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
EVE: Have him committed.
TROY: Yeah! That's thinking.
EVE: He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is.what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you Was it ever?
TROY: I don't know. I like to think so.
EVE: Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new. Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
TROY: To get some frozen poultry.
EVE: Then what?
TROY: We came back to the house!

EVE: Come on.
TROY: Trendy address.
EVE: ( to Pakistani ) Have you got a basement?
PAKISTANI: ( indicating merchandise ) Believe me, all the really good stuff is right here.
EVE: Is there a back entrance?
PAKISTANI: Are you kidding? Of course.
EVE: Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
TROY: None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
EVE: Well, we've come a long way, haven't we? I want to go home.
TROY: Yeah. Maybe he'll call.
TROY: Hi. Troy and Eve are out so leave a message. And if you want to leave a number don't say it fast! I hate that! Say it slow. Thank you. Uh, Eve.this is Adam.

EVE: ANGLE - ADAM Turning when he hears Eve yell his name.
HELEN: How long will you set it for this I thought ten years.
CALVIN: I thought ten years.
HELEN: Well, that's.considerably shorter than before. I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all. I mean the radiation is gone and.
CALVIN: To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
ADAM: I'd like for you to meet Miss Eve
EVE: ( stepping forward, offering How do you do, Mrs. Webber? Mr. ( rather dumb-struck ) Uh-huh. I've heard so many wonderful things about you.
