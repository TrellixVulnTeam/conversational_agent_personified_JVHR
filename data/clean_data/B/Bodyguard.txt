FRANK: Freeze!
FRANK: (calm, but an order) Call 911.
KLINGMAN: Your hands ever shake, Frank?
FRANK: Sometimes.   It's just adrenaline.
KLINGMAN: ... How did you know?
FRANK: I saw him washing the car.
KLINGMAN: I saw him.
FRANK: They don't wash cars on the parking levels.
KLINGMAN: You know, I'd like you to stay on.
FRANK: I'm not good in permanent positions, my feet go to sleep.
DEVANEY: So, you won't protect Rachel Marron just because she's in show business?
FRANK: I don't do celebrities.
DEVANEY: But the biggest money's in show business people.
DEVANEY: (picking up another knife) Do you really do these things?
FRANK: Isn't she the one who collects dolls?
DEVANEY: (exasperated) Farmer, Rachel Marron is one of the most famous people in America. She's won every music award invented. She's got the number one song in the country right now and she'll probably be nominated for an Oscar in her very
DEVANEY: (defeated)
DEVANEY: (no response)
DEVANEY: (whistles)
FRANK: (mumbling)
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.): Yes?
FRANK: Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.): What?
FRANK: Alexander Graham Bell to see Miss Marron!
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.): (obviously has not heard) Have you got an appointment?
FRANK: The atomic number of zinc is 30.
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.): All right.
HENRY: Can I help you?
FRANK: Are you the man on the intercom?
HENRY: No.   Can I help you?
FRANK: My name is Edison. I have an appointment with Miss Marron.
HENRY: Oh.   And that was arranged by...?
FRANK: (impressed) Mr. Devaney.
HENRY: Go right ahead, Mr. Edison.
FRANK: What happened to your arm?
HENRY: (looking at his arm) A doll.
FRANK: Henry Ford, to see Mr. Devaney.
EMMA: Come in, please.
EMMA: I'll tell you quite honestly, Mr. Ford, I don't know where Mr. Devaney is. Did he say he'd be here?
FRANK: Yes.
EMMA: Then he probably is.   Let me look.
EMMA: Please make yourself at home. Can I get you anything?
DRESS DESIGNER: (showing the costume)
DEVANEY: (not looking)
DEVANEY: (getting no response)
RACHEL (O.S.): (to dress designer)
RACHEL: (smiling)
DEVANEY: (indicating)
RACHEL: (to designer)
SPECTOR (O.S.): (into the phone)
SPECTOR: (one hand covers the phone)
RACHEL: (to assistant)
ASSISTANT: (overlapping Devaney)
DEVANEY (CONT'D): (to Frank)
SPECTOR: (punching phone)
DEVANEY: Farmer, will you wait a minute? I should have told you more. I'm sorry but I was afraid she wouldn't go through with it. I thought I'd let the two of you work it out... come to an understanding.
FRANK: We did.
DEVANEY: She's not a bad person, and whether she knows it or not, she needs you. (a beat) You've come this far... Would you just wait here for one minute. I want to show you something. Please, Farmer.
FLETCHER: Hi!
FRANK: (continuing to walk) Hi.
FLETCHER: How are you today?
FRANK: (wants to keep walking) All right. How 'bout yourself?
FLETCHER: Oh, I'm fine. Do you like boats?
FLETCHER: (thinks about this)
FRANK: (standing to leave)
FLETCHER: I've got ears.
FRANK: I'll remember that.
DEVANEY: How are you, Fletch? (to Frank) I'm glad you waited.    Let's go over here.
FRANK: (to Fletcher) Nice meeting you.
DEVANEY: This is just in the last six months.
FRANK: (looks at the pile) Have you ever tried having these professionally assessed?
SPECTOR: Devaney says you were in the Secret Service.
FRANK: I don't know. Did you tell Miss Marron about it? Does she know about the doll?
SPECTOR: We said there'd been some electrical problem while she was on stage. Short circuit. Look, she doesn't need that kind of worry right now. It would upset her.
FRANK: What about the police?
SPECTOR: There was no reason for the police. No one got hurt.
FRANK: What about the chauffeur?
SPECTOR: It was nothing. It was just our people there.
DEVANEY: Sy, I think we should show him the room.
FRANK: Is this her bedroom?
SPECTOR: Yes.
DEVANEY: No. She sleeps in a room next to Fletcher's down the hall. Sy had this done for a magazine layout,
SPECTOR: 'Superstars in their Boudoirs.'
SPECTOR: (agitated)
DEVANEY: (does a quick read on Frank) Frank, I totally respect what you're telling me. Tell me how you want to work and I'll accommodate you.
FRANK: Look, I can't protect her. I won't be responsible for her safety if she doesn't know what's going on.
DEVANEY: I'll talk to her, I'll make her understand. I can do that.
SPECTOR: No.   I'll talk to her.
DEVANEY: ...She won't give you any static, Frank, you've got my word on that.
FRANK: Sure she will.
DEVANEY: So what job's perfect? You're a bodyguard, aren't you?
FRANK: (quietly) Yeah.
FRANK: Devaney, if you ever lie to me again, I'll take you apart.
HENRY: Why'd you say your name was Edison?
FRANK: I wanted to see how hard it was to get in.
HENRY: And it wasn't, was it?
FRANK: Put this on your arm.    It'll help the ache.
FRANK: I'll bet you can fill up a whole day just washing the cars and driving Rachel Marron around town.
HENRY: That's my job.
FRANK: We're adding to your duties.
HENRY: Huh?
FRANK: You're my new assistant.
HENRY: Says who?
FRANK: Henry, I've spent a lot of time guarding people all over the world
HENRY: Who?
FRANK: The cocky black chauffeur.
MARTIN GROVE (V.O.): It's Oscar time again, folks, and with Academy members marking their ballots today for this year's nominations; some canny tipsters in Vegas have announced their picks for the Awards.
MARTIN GROVE (V.O.)(CONT'D): Echoing the prevailing buzz in Hollywood, the Vegas Hilton is gambling on one sure thing at least. Newcomer Rachel Marron is tipped at 3 to 1 to lead this year's Best Actress runners.
MARTIN GROVE (V.O.)(CONT'D): The sultry singer made a notable acting debut last fall in Queen Of The Night, singing the hit song 'I Have Nothing'. The lady may end up eating her words if she takes home that statuette March 20th...
FRANK: Unusual tactic for a guard dog, but effective.
NICKI: You can look around if you like.
FRANK: I'm sorry to disturb you.
NICKI: That's all right. It's an excuse to rest. It's my private place. I'm the only one who works out around here.
NICKI: My own ego wall. No platinum records.
FRANK: You and Rachel?
NICKI: When I was a kid, I put a little band together. We played high school dances, stuff like that. Then Rachel joined the act. As you can imagine, she was quite a little entertainer. Even then, she had a way of stopping the show. So I kind of quit. Professionally, anyway.
FRANK: You never went back?
NICKI: It was pretty obvious who the star in our family was.
HENRY: That depends on what you call a 'hint.'
FRANK: I don't want anyone on the street to be able to look at the cars and know who owns them.
HENRY: I don't think there's anything here you'd call a 'hint.'
FRANK: Get new plates for those two.
RACHEL: Fletcher!    C'mon. Back in here!
FLETCHER: I think he's got a black 4 X 4. Could be a Chevy. More like a Toyota.
COURT (O.S.): This    is another of the ones we think    are worth pursuing. Lots of work    went into it. No prints. We're    doing lab work on it. It could    be nothing.
MINELLA: This is the one you think is tied to the doll?
FRANK (O.S.): That's what her manager thinks.
COURT (O.S.): This 'I Have Nothing' business is a natural with the record and movie and all.
COURT: I sort of lost track of you after Washington.
FRANK: Yeah.
COURT: How's the private stuff?
FRANK: (noncommittal) Fine.
COURT: Big money, I bet? Huh?
COURT: Shit. I knew it. It is big money. Fuck! You need an assistant? I'm ready to get out. I've lost my tolerance for assholic behavior. You should see the jerk we're covering now...
COURT: 'Hellfire Henry' Kent...
MINELLA: Shh!    Somebody wants to pop him...
COURT: Which isn't exactly surprising, considering what the shithead's
MINELLA: Yeah!  Do everyone a favor... (he coughs, ironically) As you know, we're nonpolitical these days.
COURT: (to Frank) We'll put this stuff through Washington. Behavioral Sciences should have something in a few days.
FRANK: Thanks. (a pause) Ray?
COURT: Yeah?
FRANK: Why am I getting all this cooperation?
MINELLA: She's a big star. Important people care about her.
COURT: Politics and show business are practically the same these days... Got any crowd photos we can use?
FRANK: I'm trying to keep her away from crowds.
COURT: Good luck.
WOMAN: (an afterthought; phony) Goodbye, Nicki. So great to see you.
RACHEL: I'm surprised you didn't plug them.
TONY: (impatiently) Hey, let's go.
FRANK: (across Tony) O.K. Henry, let's go.
TONY: Let me set you straight on a few things. For starters, I love this lady... What I do for her I do for
FRANK: (to Henry)
FRANK: No, just slow down.
SPECTOR: Why are we stopping?    Are we here?
FRANK: Stop here... Take them to the house.
TONY: What's with him?
FRANK: Keep this loose.
FLETCHER: Tell me about the car?
FRANK: Toyota.     Black.
FLETCHER: Four wheel drive? Late model?
FRANK: One snag though.
FLETCHER: What?
FRANK: 360,000 of them in Los Angeles.    I checked. Nice work, though.
FLETCHER: (shrugging) Well, nobody's perfect, Frank. Are they? (gesturing to the
SURV KIT): Can I try that?
RACHEL: Shut up you assholes!
RACHEL: (clutching the swimsuit) You! You! Out! Out!        Now!   Out of here! Get out!
OLD LOCKSMITH: Yes, ma'am. Thank you. I'm a real fan of yours, Miss Marron.
RACHEL: Then you can take your tools with you.
HENRY: Is that Devaney?
FLETCHER: (to Frank) She's got him by the short ones, doesn't she, Frank?
FRANK: Yeah, she makes him nervous.
RACHEL: I want him gone.
DEVANEY: What is it now?
NICKI: He told Rachel no Sunday brunch at Charlie's.
DEVANEY: No Sunday brunch. That's why you called me up here?
RACHEL: That is not it! It's my money and my life and I want him out of here.
DEVANEY: Where is he?
DEVANEY: (leaning out the glass door)
RACHEL: (mimicking him)
DEVANEY: (interrupting)
SPECTOR: (stretching it out) Tuesday -- morning -- brunch. Where did you find this guy?
HENRY: (looking at the youths) I wish Rachel didn't keep coming here. It makes me nervous.
TONY: Me too. 'Cept I'm not nervous 'cos I got you with me.
RACHEL: Louise, you've got too much great stuff.
OWNER: (from the back of the shop, laughing) Take it all, darlin'.
RACHEL: Wooo!   Let me try this on.
RACHEL: (to Frank, indicating the open booth)
FRANK: (very flat)
FRANK: (without interest)
FRANK: (to Henry)
FRANK: (to Spector)
FRANK: It's fitted with a radio transmitter. When you close the clasp, it sends a signal. If there's ever a problem and we're separated, just press it and I'll know you need me.
SPECTOR: Okay, she knows how it works, let's get going.
RADIO D.J. (V.O.): You're listening to K.R.O.K., the rock of L.A. and yes we have.
(MORE): We told you we'd crack the case of the mystery guest... and if you are one of the few who hasn't heard, it's Rachel at the Mayan.
RADIO D.J. (V.O.): Rachel Marron, tonight, appearing as Billy Thomas' very special guest. But if you don't have a ticket, you can forget going down there. Police are asking us to ask you to stay away. So everybody, please stay cool, stay tuned and we'll try to get you some interviews after the show. Remember, you heard it here on K.R.O.K. -- the station that delivers.
SPECTOR: It wasn't me.
TONY: Fuckin' a.
CROWD: Rachel!   Rachel! We want Rachel!
JOURNALIST: ... and this is my exclusive?
SPECTOR: I swear I thought she'd talk to you. Maybe later. What can I say.
DEVANEY: He sent another one.
RACHEL: What do you mean 'another one'?
FRANK: They didn't tell you.
SPECTOR: Let's just see how she is. (to Rachel) How do you feel, honey?
FRANK: I can't protect her out there.
RACHEL: Do you think he's out there?
RACHEL: He's here, isn't he?
FRANK: He might be.
SPECTOR: We don't know that. Frank, we don't know that.
RACHEL: But you know he was in my house... oh my God.
DEVANEY: Let's go home, Sy. We'll have to make an announcement.
SPECTOR: Fine, you make it, they'll tear the fucking place apart.
DEVANEY: Excuse me... hello... I've got an announcement to make. I'm sorry but... due to circumstances beyond...
RACHEL: Wait...
FRANK: Rachel... don't do it.    It's not worth it...
RACHEL: (cutting him off) No fucking freak is gonna chase me off stage.
DEVANEY: Rachel won't be able...
RACHEL: Bill Devaney, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Bill. Hey, everyone. Hello! Isn't Billy Thomas the greatest. He's asked me to sing a song. I hope you don't mind.
SPECTOR: Are we having a communications problem here?
FRANK: What?
SPECTOR: Apparently, I didn't make it clear to you how things go around here.
FRANK: You told me you were going to tell her. And you didn't.
SPECTOR: I didn't think she could handle it.
FRANK: But she handled it fine.
SPECTOR: Look. Frank, I know what you're saying. I know you want to do what's best for her. I understand that. You have a job to do here. But you have to understand that Rachel has a job to do too. And that's what she's doing - out there. She's working, Frank. That's what she does and that's where she does it. She's hot right now. This is the time for her. If she doesn't get out there, she's dead. Forget about crazy death threats, if she doesn't sing, she's dead anyway... Look, handled properly, this thing could be good for a million dollars' worth of free publicity.
FRANK: One word.
SPECTOR: It could clinch her the nomination.
FRANK: One word in print about any of this...
SPECTOR: Trouble with you is you don't understand the sympathy vote.
RACHEL: (turning back to crowd) You like that? Would like to hear another? Billy?
RACHEL: (on the prowl) I think my feet are trying to tell me something... wanna see a new video?
RACHEL: (dancing, talking) I want to dance...
SPECTOR: Look at her, fucking great.
FRANK: Tony, not there.
TONY: I'll take care of this.
TONY: Just follow me.
TONY: Make way here. Outta the way!
SPECTOR: Hey! What the fuck... Farmer! Farmer! Come back here...
HENRY: Never done that before.
FRANK: It's been a long night.
RACHEL: Aren't you going to ask me why I behave like that?
FRANK: I know why.
FRANK: I don't want to talk about this again.
RACHEL: (as Frank nods)
RACHEL: (hard for her) (she looks at him)
RACHEL: Farmer... I have this problem. This minor little problem. You see, I'd like to go out for an evening. Just me and a guy. You know... (makes a funny face) ... like a 'date.' But I can't go out on a date because you have to be with me every minute. I mean, what if he invited me up to his place afterwards? Are you going to come, too? (a beat) So the only thing I can figure is for you to take me out. (pause) So... that's what I was wondering ... you know. What do you think? But only if you want to.
RACHEL: Only if you want to... I'm not so bad... (looks at him) God, this is embarrassing. I'm gonna run up ahead there. You decide.
NICKI (O.S.): Rachel!    Sandy Harris is on the phone!
RACHEL: Tell her she'll have to wait, babe. I'm getting fixed up here.
D.J. (V.O.): ... And here's another biggie from a lady very much in the news these days, Miss Rachel Marron...
D.J. (V.O.): ... the hit song from the movie... Queen Of The Night... I Have Nothing.
RACHEL: Well, he didn't look like he wanted to die to me.
FRANK: There's a big difference between wanting to die and having no fear of death.
RACHEL: And because he had no fear of death, he was invincible?
FRANK: What do you think?
RACHEL: Well, he sure creamed 'em all in the end.
FRANK: Yeah, it was a good movie.
RACHEL: How many times have you seen it?
FRANK: Sixty-two.
RACHEL: Your kinda place?
FRANK: Yeah.
RACHEL: Your kinda music?
FRANK: Absolutely.
RACHEL: You figure no one can get by you here?
FRANK: If someone is willing to swap his life for a kill, nothing can stop him.
RACHEL: Great.   What do I need you for?
FRANK: He might get me instead.
RACHEL: And you're ready to die for me?
FRANK: That's my job.
RACHEL: And you'd do it? Why?
FRANK: I can't sing.
RACHEL: Maybe there's some glory in saving a president or something, but just anyone...
FRANK: You mean like you?    It's a matter
RACHEL: I don't trust discipline. At the crucial moment I'd cop out.
FRANK: That happens.
RACHEL: But not with you, Fierce Frank.
FRANK: It happens.
RACHEL: Have you ever liked anybody?
FRANK: What do you mean?
RACHEL: Like me -- a girl.
FRANK: A long time ago.
RACHEL: What happened? Do you mind if I ask?
FRANK: Do you mind if I don't answer?
RACHEL: I don't want to pry...
RACHEL: (begins to laugh, can't help herself) She didn't die did she? You weren't like... protecting her and she got killed?
RACHEL: Oh, my god!    That's it, isn't it?
FRANK: Nobody's perfect.
RACHEL: Oh Frank, I'm sorry.
FRANK: No... Nice try though. (pause) It was less dramatic than that. She didn't love me anymore. Can you imagine such a thing?
RACHEL: No, not really.
RACHEL: So, is this a full service date, Frank?
RACHEL: I'm just asking you to dance.
RACHEL: You like this?
FRANK: Yeah.
FRANK: (reddening) What?
RACHEL: (trying to compose herself) I'm sorry... It's just that... It's so depressing.
FRANK: (grinning) It is, isn't it.
RACHEL: Don't worry, I'll protect you.
RACHEL: (almost to herself) It's very quiet here.
RACHEL: (reading) West Virginia University Football. God, look at you.
RACHEL: What'd you play?
RACHEL: It seems to me a bodyguard must know little peace.
FRANK: Watch this.
RACHEL: I've never been this safe before.
RACHEL: No one could get by you.
FRANK: Right now it might not be so hard.
FLETCHER: (watching him) She's real mad at you, isn't she?
FLETCHER: She told me she doesn't understand why you're so shitty to her...
FRANK: I've spent a lot of time learning not to react to things like other people do. It's my job. But it doesn't always work, Fletcher... it doesn't always work.
FLETCHER: I don't think I understand.
FRANK: (looks at him) I'm an old man compared to you, pal, and I don't understand either. And I'm starting to get the feeling I never will.
NICKI (O.S.): Ta Da!
NICKI: (looking at him) Thought you'd like to know. Everyone said she was a sure thing. Of course, you know all about that.
NICKI: I'm sorry. That was out of line. It's none of my business... Here's today's question marks for you.
SPECTOR (O.S.): Farmer!   Get in here!
SPECTOR: Put together a list of   your expenses. Your total    billing... Let me have it in one   hour and I'll see that a check   is cut.
FRANK: Don't you ever say what's on your mind?
SPECTOR: (almost shouts) What's on my mind is that you're fired, Frank. She missed all her interviews yesterday because of your little date. Do you realize she stood up Barbara Walters? First you fuck up her career...
SPECTOR: ... and now you're fucking with her head.
FRANK: That's between us.
SPECTOR: You think so? You forget who signs your check. You don't understand the role I play around here.
RACHEL: (flatly)
SPECTOR: (into phone)
SPECTOR: (into phone)
RACHEL: (to Frank) Hang around, Farmer. We might need your vaunted expertise.
RACHEL: (sweetly) Hello, Ben honey.
SCHILLER (V.O.): Rachel, congratulations, you must be thrilled at the...
RACHEL: (across him) Ben. I hear you've got me in the annex next to the kitchen.
JOHN TESH (V.O.): ...It's off to Sun City today for Best Actress nominee Rachel Marron. Rachel's giving two AIDS charity concerts this week at Miami's Fontainebleau Hotel. A thousand a plate no less. And rumor has it that the lovely lady has unseated the governor of Florida himself. Seems there was a showdown on who'll get to lounge in that big Fontainebleau penthouse tonight.
JOHN TESH (V.O.): Well, sleep tight in the Presidential Suite, Rachel. Who says a nomination isn't as good as winning...
FRANK: Thuringer.
THURINGER: God damn.    I'll get someone right on it.
FRANK: Okay.   Let's go.
THURINGER: It's okay, they've been cleared.
THURINGER: (to Frank) The Katzes of St. Louis. Very prominent. Come every year. An elderly couple and three grandchildren. A nurse and a maid.
THURINGER: Hi, Mark.
MARK: Hi.
THURINGER: (to Frank) Theirs is the only suite on the floor.
THURINGER: As you asked, the rooms below have been kept vacant.
FRANK: What a silly job this is.
SPECTOR: O.K. Rachel. It's showtime! They're rolling. Let's go.
FRANK: Is this really necessary?
SPECTOR: Yes.   It is.
RACHEL: Quit bitching, Farmer. This is the part you do get paid for.
RACHEL: Oh my God. Look what they're wearing. Mother, hide your eyes...
RACHEL: I couldn't wear that suit... Honey, you're naked... Of course, if I had a body like that...
RACHEL: (to lifeguard) (to Schiller)
RACHEL: (over her shoulder)
RACHEL: (to Spector)
SPECTOR: (very fast) Kick me, beat me... whatever makes you feel good. But let's not pretend you don't like it. We're too close for that. Whipping people into a frenzy is why you got into it in the first place.
SPECTOR: And it's nothing to be ashamed of, either, not for a second. It's a gift... and only a handful are given it. Many call but few are answered.
SPECTOR (CONT'D): Don't fool with the blessing, Rachel. The magic is sustained through its use.
RACHEL: Now you're going to tell me about magic? Give it a rest will ya...
SPECTOR: I'm done. Not another word... (a crooked smile) ... I know you like to be reminded sometimes.
PORTMAN: Hello, Farmer.
PORTMAN: (nods) (smiles)
PORTMAN: (impressed)
PORTMAN: I heard you had to take someone out in New York.
PORTMAN: I lost track of you after the Reagan thing.
FRANK: Yeah.
PORTMAN: It wasn't your fault, Farmer. You weren't even there.
PORTMAN: I got a call a couple of months ago. That guy you were covering in New York. He said you'd recommended me.
FRANK: Surprised?
PORTMAN: A little.
FRANK: (smiles) I never doubted your skills.
PORTMAN: (laughs, good- natured) No. Only my qualifications for the priesthood. You were always clear about that. Anyway, I appreciate it. I had to turn it down but I appreciate it.
RACHEL: That's orange juice!
RACHEL: Who are you?
PORTMAN: Greg Portman.
RACHEL: I take it you've met my bodyguard?
PORTMAN: We used to work together.
RACHEL: (suddenly more interested) Ah... Well, well, well.    And what do you do now?
PORTMAN: Same thing as Farmer.
RACHEL: (looking between them) Two samurai, eh?
RACHEL: (to Portman) Are you working now?
PORTMAN: Not right now.
RACHEL: Good. (she takes his arm) 'cause I'm the only one in the room who needs protection.
FRANK: What happened!
PORTMAN: Somebody tripped. It's okay.
RACHEL: (looking at Portman) Thank God I had a bodyguard here.
RACHEL: It's a long way down, Frank. (to Portman) You saved my life.
RACHEL: Maybe someone will keep an eye on me while I change.
WOMAN IN GREEN: I've been watching you all night from across the room.
FRANK: Why don't you go back there and keep watching?
FRANK: (softly) Go to sleep.
RACHEL: I'm not doing this.
PORTMAN: (still holding her) I think you are.
RACHEL: I said I was grateful.   Thank you and good night.
RACHEL: (cool) Please go now.
RACHEL: Mr. Portman was just leaving us, Tony.
RACHEL: (nasty) What the hell are you looking at? (pause) You probably never had a heavy night in your whole, goddamn disciplined life.
RACHEL: You know, Farmer, you're a self- righteous son-of-a-bitch.
RACHEL: Don't laugh at me, goddamit!   And don't you dare judge me.
FRANK: Give me a break, will ya? I didn't tell you to fuck everybody in the hotel!
COURT (V.O.): It matches the traces in the glue, Frank. We're getting to him.
FRANK: Yeah, well, don't take too long, Ray.
COURT (V.O.): Hey, Frank.   It's good money, isn't it?
FRANK: Where is she? Where's Tony?
DEVANEY: I don't know. I thought you were with her.
FRANK: (into phone) Thuringer, this is Farmer. Where's your man on the door to the suite? (listens) Well get someone up here.
FRANK: He doesn't know.
DEVANEY: Where are you going?
RACHEL: Hello, Devaney.
DEVANEY: Rachel, where the hell have you been?
RACHEL: Tony and I went over to Bal Harbour. Did a little shopping.
DEVANEY: We were worried. (looks at Frank, talks to Rachel) You know you're not supposed to do that.
RACHEL: Farmer, you work here! Do you understand that? You work for me.
DEVANEY: Rachel.
DEVANEY: Farmer, where are you going?
FRANK: I'm gonna check the route.    As usual.
RACHEL: Did Fletcher call?
FRANK: Gomez!   Louis Gomez!
FRANK: What are you doing?
ENORMOUS CUBAN: Is none of you fuckin' business.
FRANK: Move it.
ENORMOUS CUBAN: Shove it up you ass, motherfucker.
CLEANING WOMAN (O.S.): Stop! Please. Don't hurt him. Please stop!
CLEANING WOMAN: Don't hurt my husband, mister.       He not up to nothing.
FRANK: I'm sorry.
RACHEL: Fletcher?
RACHEL: Baby, is that you? It's mommy, honey.
DAN (V.O.): (eerily distorted) Guess again, whore! Fuck you and fuck Miami. I'm coming for you. I know where you are and I'm coming for you...
FRANK: I'm through. I'll get you back to L.A. and that's it. The guy with Fletcher can cover you till you get a replacement.
DEVANEY: She got another call, while you were downstairs and she answered it herself. It was him, Frank. Same guy.
FRANK: (moving toward balcony) I don't care.
DEVANEY: Farmer, it really shook her up. She thought it was going to be Fletcher calling her from L.A. I think she'll be reasonable now.
FRANK: (across him) Save it, Devaney. The people who hire me don't have to be convinced to save their own lives.
FRANK: Call me when she's ready to go down.
DEVANEY: Farmer --
RACHEL: (a beat)
FRANK: No Spector or Devaney or Tony.
FRANK: If you cross me up this time, I'll kill you myself.
FRANK: Lake's a little low.
HERB: Fill up soon enough when she thaws. (glancing at the van) They all in trouble?
FRANK: Just one.
RACHEL: That's going to protect us?
FRANK: He's a trained noisemaker.
RACHEL: Terrific.
FRANK: I don't like big dogs. They don't know who they're eating.
HERB: Katherine had this place organized just the way she wanted it. (seeing her questioning look) Frank's momma.
RACHEL: Fletcher doesn't swim well.
HERB: I guess he'd better stay in the boat then. (his smile puts her at ease) Frank tells me you're a singer.
RACHEL: That's right.
HERB: I'm afraid we're a little out of touch here. I'm sorry.
HERB: You must be very successful to need Frank.
RACHEL: It's so quiet here.
HERB: Frank came back and stayed six months after the Reagan thing.
HERB: Frank wasn't there the day he was shot. He never got over that. (a long pause) We buried Katherine that day.
FRANK: I don't want anyone going out in it until you've checked it over first. Okay? Every time.
HENRY: Every time.
FRANK: Every time.
FRANK: (inclining his head toward the photo) Portman sometimes had trouble remembering what his job was. Supper's ready.
HERB: ... And I never hit him. Ever. To this day. (to Frank) That's true, isn't it? (to Rachel) That's very unusual for my people. So what happens? When he's ten years old, he complains about it? Can you believe that?
FRANK: Oh, for Chrissake! I'm going to tell her about the time you stripped in court.
HERB: (to Frank) I don't care. I'm proud of that. (to Rachel) Anyway, he's ten years old and he's just started playing tackle football. He comes to me and tells me he's afraid of getting hit, right? And he thinks it's because I never hit him. 'Why don't you ever hit me?' he says to me!
FRANK: (back over his shoulder) If you're lucky, maybe he'll tell you about my first jockstrap.
HERB (O.S.): He got over it: Turned into a helluva wide receiver. He couldn't stand being afraid. When he found something that scared him, he'd just do it 'til the fear went away.
HERB: His mother was the same way.
HERB: Come on, son, you can run but you can't hide.
HERB: Your move.
RACHEL: How long has this game been going on?
FRANK: Three years.
HERB: He had me on the run there that first year.
FRANK: What do you think?
FLETCHER: Knight to king-four.
FRANK: City kid.
HERB: Come over here, Fletcher, sit by me.
RACHEL: Well, that's it for me, I'm going to bed.
FRANK: Good night, Rachel.
RACHEL: Good night, Frank.
NICKI: (softly) You're very thorough.
NICKI: What's happening between you and Rachel?
NICKI: Come on. One minute she's got magnetic hands, the next she hates you. I can't figure out what it is now.
FRANK: You follow all her moves this closely?
NICKI: (smiling) It's a living.
FRANK: No, it isn't.
NICKI: You think my life is pretty sickly, don't you?
FRANK: No.
NICKI: You must.    I do.
FRANK: (with force)
NICKI: It's not so simple.
FRANK: Yes it is. You can walk out that fucking door anytime you want. I'll unlock it for you.
NICKI: Let me go.
FRANK: Okay.     It's not my business.
FRANK: Raccoon... deer...?
FRANK: Where's Fletcher?
HENRY: (shouting) Frank! I haven't...
FRANK: Fletcher!   Fletcher!
RACHEL: (screams) No!   He can't swim!
RACHEL: Fletcher, baby. Are you all right? Baby.
HERB: He's all right.
RACHEL: What are you doing? You out of your mind? You're crazy! (to Fletcher) You're all right, baby. (back to Frank) You could have drowned him!
FRANK: I'm sorry.   I got careless.
HENRY: Frank, I'm sorry. I should have...
HERB: It's okay, Henry.
HERB: You all right now, son?
HENRY: How do we get the boat back?
FRANK: (to Henry) Back off.
HERB: Frank!
HERB: Someone's cut the phone lines. It could be anywhere between here and town.
FRANK: Both the cars are dead. And I can't see how it was done.
FRANK: Who could know we're here? This place has nothing to do with her.
HERB: Maybe it has to do with you.
HERB: We can't walk out of here at night with them.
FRANK: We'll button down tonight and walk out at first light.
NICKI: (crying) I was an idiot last night.
NICKI: What do you think about today?
FRANK: (gently) I think this is no maniac.   He knows what he's doing.
NICKI: You're right. He does.
FRANK: Tell me about it.
FRANK: Who is it, Nicki?
NICKI: He almost got Fletcher today...
FRANK: How do we stop him?
NICKI: ...my darling Fletcher...
FRANK: Who is it?
NICKI: (shaking her head)
NICKI: (vague)
NICKI: (nods)
NICKI: (desperately) No, no. You don't understand. The letters came first. I don't know who's sending them... but they're reading my mind... Those were my thoughts. I hate her. It made me think I could do it... But I could never hurt Fletcher. Never. (begging him) You've got to stop it!
FRANK: We will. You and me. Tomorrow we're going back to L.A. We're going to find the bar, we're going to find Armando.
NICKI: Don't you even want to know why?
FRANK: You told me.     She has everything.
NICKI: What if we can't --
FRANK: Stay here.    Don't move.
HERB: It's me!
RACHEL (O.S.): What's happening?
NICKI (O.S.): No, no... stop... I'm the one who...
RACHEL: Frank?
FRANK: (to Herb) Stay with Rachel!
FRANK: (yelling) Dad?
HERB (O.S.): We're okay!
FRANK: Stay with Rachel!
RACHEL: What's happening? Where's Nicki?
HERB: Be quiet!
MINELLA (V.O.): But, Frank, this doesn't make sense...
FRANK: What do you mean?
MINELLA (V.O.): We already got him.
FRANK: What?   Where?
MINELLA: Here, last night. You should see his locker, Frank. The guy's obsessed with Rachel Marron...
FRANK: You're sure it's him?
MINELLA: Forensics say it's 100 percent positive I.D... And he's got a black Toyota 4 x 4. Ray's with him now.
MINELLA (V.O.): This is crazy... What do you want to do, Frank?
FRANK: How long can you keep him?
MINELLA (V.O.): Well technically all he's done is write some letters. 48 hours maximum. You know the deal.
FLETCHER: You okay, Frank?
FRANK: Yeah, Fletcher, I'm okay.     How 'bout you?
FLETCHER: I couldn't sleep... It was so scary, just thinking about it...
FLETCHER: Do you feel scared, Frank?
FRANK: Yeah, Fletcher, I do.
FRANK: Everybody's afraid of something, Flethcer. That's how we know we care about something, when we're afraid we'll lose it.
FLETCHER: What are you afraid of?
FRANK: I think you should try to go back to sleep now, pal.
FLETCHER: Tell me, Frank, please. Is it the man who killed Nicki? Are you afraid of him?
FLETCHER: Then what?    What are you afraid of?
FRANK: I'm afraid... of not being there...
FRANK: It's late. Do you want me to take you back to your room?
RACHEL: (hysterical) You, you, you... You brought this pain into my house... Now you're here! Where were you then? Why didn't you save her? It was your job to protect me and she died doing it... It was me they were after. And you let them kill her! (she gasps for air) She never did anything to anyone.
RACHEL: She never hurt anyone. She was good. (she looks at him; entreats him) You saw her. She never wished anyone any harm. Did she? Did she?
RACHEL: (finally, quietly) She never hurt a soul. (long pause) ... I didn't love her well enough. I didn't take care of her... (a beat) ... She gave me only love.
RACHEL: I guess you've heard what's happening.
RACHEL: Mind if I sit down?
RACHEL: It isn't over yet, is it?
FRANK: He knows he still hasn't got you.
RACHEL: So he'll come again?
RACHEL: (as Frank nods) (looks at him)
RACHEL: I don't know why all this has happened to me... (a beat) ... but I do know that none of it's your fault. I hope you can hear me, because this is how I say I'm sorry.
RACHEL: (relieved) So... I'm going to go see if I win an Oscar. And I won't worry about it at all. Because I've got you to protect me.
FRANK: That's right.
DEVANEY: We'll go straight back to the Green Room. Right, Frank?
DEVANEY: Got that, Tony?
FRANK: Tony knows what he's doing.
RACHEL: I wish you boys would relax a little. Nothing bad's gonna happen out there, alright? (the old Rachel) Unless I lose the fucking award.
RACHEL: Jesus, what a crew.
RACHEL: Screw it. I'm through worrying. When your number's up, it's up. Right, Farmer?
M.C.: ... Miss Rachel Marron!
M.C.: Everyone wishes you the best tonight, Rachel.
SKIP: Hello, Rachel. I need to get you straight on your responsibilities.
RACHEL: Sure, Skip.
SKIP: Now, it's Best Sound, then another song, then you. At precisely (looks at his clipboard) -- 8:07, you'll be presenting with Clive Healy. Those are your lines. The prompter's straight ahead and -- we pray -- working perfectly.
RACHEL: Fine, you'll be a big shot someday, Skip.
CLIVE: I understand it's my great honor to escort you onstage.
RACHEL: That's right, Clive. And I don't like it one bit that you look skinnier than me.
PATRICIA: ... And the award for Best Achievement in Sound goes to Kay Colvin and Mychal Smith for Hot And Cold.
KAY: Thank you so much. I want to thank our producers, Karen Golden and Ed Gorsuch, as well our sound crew -- Richard Goodman and Blair Forward. I'm too excited -- but they're the real winners tonight. Thank you!
MICHAEL: This is wonderful. This is like, the happiest moment of my life. I'd like to thank our wonderful sound crew for all the evenings and weekends they sacrificed, the incredible wizards down at Distant Thunder Sound Studios, Roger and Greg for hiring us and my family for being so patient. We did it! Thank you!
SKIP: Rachel.    One more song, then you.
FRANK: I'm going to have a look around. I'll come back for her. Stay alert.
FRANK: Portman.   What are you doing here?
PORTMAN: I'm on the job.
FRANK: Who?
PORTMAN: Him.
REARDON (V.O.): (on TV screen) My mother has always thought I was the star of every movie I've been in. You remember 'Night Of The Stranger'?
REARDON (V.O.): You probably don't remember me in that. My mother can tell you about it. To this day, she thinks it's about a desk clerk at the hotel where what's-his-name is hiding out from the cops.
REARDON (V.O.): Now it's time to hear the final nominated song, from the film 'Queen Of The Night' -- 'I Have Nothing.' And here to sing it for us, the multi-talented Miss Sandra Castle!
PORTMAN (O.S.): (during the above) Short-term gig... but quite profitable... Listen, Frank, I'm sorry about Miami. You know, nothing really happened... I felt bad for you... I wanted to say something, but you disappeared...
PORTMAN: Back to work. I'll probably see you at the Governor's Ball.
RACHEL: I want that broad run out of town.
FRANK: Tony, you there?
TONY: Yeah, Frank.
FRANK: Tony, I've got a feeling this is the night. I think he's gonna go for her in front of all the cameras. The kind of thing only a lunatic would do. That's how he wants it to look. Except he isn't a lunatic. He's very clever. I need you to help me.
TONY: I'm with you, Frank.
TECHNICIAN: (to Frank) You can't use that thing back here. The  breakthrough's killing our radio mikes... We'll have to disconnect you.
TONY: Frank?... Frank?
RACHEL: (spooked) What's wrong?
SKIP: Rachel... Clive. Let's go, okay?
SKIP: (indicating Tony) Really. Must we have everyone? We have our own men at the door.
FRANK: Tony stays.
RACHEL: Yes!    I want him.
CLIVE: Come, Rachel, let us brighten the firmament.
CLIVE: Try to relax, Rachel. I know you must be very excited.
SKIP: Watch your step going down. Someone spilled some water.
REARDON (V.O.): (on screen) I used to have an outfit just like that... And to present the Best Song award we have our debonair friend from England and the lady who has everything -- Clive Healy and Rachel Marron!
CLIVE: (reading from the prompter) Well, Rachel, I know that you only came tonight to present this award and you'll want to leave as soon as we're done.
CLIVE (O.S.): Over the course of the evening we've heard five smashing songs and the names of the artists who created them.
CLIVE: And I know that no matter what anyone thinks, you have no personal favorites.
CLIVE: The Best Song nominees are: "Clock On The Wall" from 'The Dining Room Table' -- By Dana S. Lee and Sara Spring. 'Give Me Your Trust' from 'Out Of the Gloom' -- By David Siegel and Barbara G. Gordon. "I Have Nothing" from 'Queen Of The Night' -- By Nancy Garbor. "Maybe Soon" from 'Maybe Soon' -- Anne Trop and Ben Glass. And "Reflections Of My Heart" from 'Hot And Cold' -- By Leslie Moraes.
RACHEL: (reading) -- let's find out who the winner is.
CLIVE: The envelope. Rachel, shall I do the honors?
"I HAVE NOTHING": Music by
CLIVE: And the winner is "I Have Nothing"
NANCY GARBOR: This is so exciting. I can't begin to describe what it feels like to stand here -- with this!
STAR #1: I always said she was nuts.    I've always said that.
CLIVE: Is she all right?
REARDON: (to Rachel)
REARDON: (breaking away)
SKIP: Rachel, I'm sorry, but if you're going to be in your seat for the Best Actress award, you've got to do it now.
RACHEL: Skip, I'm moving as fast as I can. For chrissake, go twitch somewhere else.
SPECTOR: Honey, everything's fine. No one noticed anything. Everybody in this building is ready to jump out of their skin from nerves.
RACHEL: Bullshit, you saw me. Farmer's made me a raving lunatic --
FRANK: Something's going on you should know about --
SPECTOR: You're making her crazy.   You're making us all crazy.
FRANK: Rachel, I know who it is. He's here tonight. I think he's...
RACHEL: Shut up...
RACHEL: (hissing at him) Shut up, you maniac! You never stop. Now you've made an ass of me in front of a billion people. And you won't quit.
FRANK: Tony, it's Portman.   Remember?   The guy from Miami...
SPECTOR: After tonight, you're back in charge.
TONY: What?
SPECTOR: He knows nothing about show business.
TONY: You are an asshole.
WINSTON: Thank you, John, thank you, Academy.
WINSTON (O.S.): ...And the nominees for best performance by an actress in a leading role are -- Constance Simpson for Hot and Cold...
WINSTON (O.S.): ...Ellen Pearson for Maybe Soon...
WINSTON (O.S.): ... Rachel Marron for Queen Of The Night...
WINSTON (O.S.): L.C. Dean for I Dream Of Peace ...and Evelyn Gardner for The Harper Plan...
WINSTON: And the winner is... Rachel Marron for Queen Of The Night.
TONY: Hey! You! What the fuck you think you're doin' back here...
RACHEL: No!
TV DIRECTOR: What the fuck?
OTHER VOICE (O.S.): Go to commercial...
RACHEL: He's my bodyguard. Get off him! He's O.K...
TONY: (bellowing) Frank! Frank! Over here!
FRANK: (indicating eyepatch) How's it going?
FRANK: (pats bandaged torso)
FRANK: (ruffling Fletcher's hair)
FRANK: He's very good.
RACHEL: Why'd you have to get me an old man?
FRANK: I don't trust you.
RACHEL: Yeah... well, give me a kiss and let's get this over with.
FRANK: 'Bye Rachel.
DEVANEY: That wasn't so bad. (he sees her tears) You okay?
RACHEL: Wait...
RACHEL: Remember when you said you'd risk your life for me?
RACHEL: I didn't really believe it then. Nobody means what they say. But you did, Frank. You did it. You laid it all on the line for me.
RACHEL: Don't wreck this for me. I don't want to hear any bullshit about you just doing your job. You did more than save my life, Frank. You showed me a way to be. And I love you for it. (a beat) There, I said it. (looks at him) I'll never forget what it felt like to be under your eye. Never.
FRANK: (smiles) I won't be forgetting you either.
RACHEL: Here... I want you to keep this. If you ever need me, you just put this on and no matter where you are I will find you.  I promise.
RACHEL: Thank you... Thank you... Now I want to sing you an old song, but it's a new favorite.
RACHEL: You know, this song used to make me feel sad... But it doesn't anymore.
RACHEL: Now it just reminds me of someone very special... This is for him.
ROTARY PRESIDENT (O.S.): Our speaker this evening, the honorable congressman from the fifth district, Galen Windsor, has been a lone, courageous, voice... he alone has challenged those who have linked organized crime with legitimate business throughout our state.
ROTARY PRESIDENT (O.S.): But first our benediction will be delivered by Reverend Phillip Hardy of the First Presbyterian Church.
REVEREND HARDY: Heavenly Father, please bless us today as we meet in friendship and duty.
REVEREND HARDY (O.S.): And Lord, whatever dangerous endeavors those among us may take, let them never be without your sanctuary.
REVEREND HARDY: ... For all we know in our hearts that even though we may walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you are with us... guiding and protecting us. Amen.
