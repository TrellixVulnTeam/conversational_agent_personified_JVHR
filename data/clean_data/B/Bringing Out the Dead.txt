GRISS: Things are backing up.
NURSE CONSTANCE: Just keep moving. Don't even slow Sir, you say you've been snorting cocaine for three days and now you feel your heart is beating too fast and you would like us to help you.

NURSE CONSTANCE: He just needs a bath and some food. Take him in back and see if you can find a stretcher.

FRANK: You never know.
MARY: I mean if he was dead, I could handle At least he's got people around him.
FRANK: At least he's got people around him.
MARY: I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
FRANK: Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
MARY: Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
FRANK: Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.

FRANK: The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.

FRANK: What do you think?
HAZMAT: Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilizehe's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those The family know?
FRANK: The family know?
HAZMAT: I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's
NURSE CONSTANCE: . you put poison in your veins and now that you're breathing again you can't wait to say thank you and go back to poison shopping. Well, since we saved your life, maybe you could do us a favor and stop breathing in another city next time .
MARCUS: I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
FRANK: Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
MARCUS: No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
FRANK: Make a left here. I want to stop.
FRANK: I'll be right back.
FRANK: Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
FRANK: Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
MARY: I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
FRANK: You look so different.
MARY: I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
FRANK: I think it looks good.
MARY: I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my How is she?
FRANK: How is she?
MARY: I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
FRANK: I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
MARY: You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you. Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
FRANK: Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
MARY: ( looks at him )
MARCUS: Who's that?
FRANK: She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
MARCUS: Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
FRANK: I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
MARCUS: God help us, he's hungry too.
MARY: Dad, can you hear me? Open your eyes if you can hear me.

MARY: He hears me. Open your eyes, Dad.
HAZMAT: Nurse Crupp, I need ten milligrams of Valium.
FRANK: Why don't we go outside for a little while, wait until this passes.
FRANK: He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painfulthat's why they keep him sedatedbut it's a good sign.
MARY: You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
FRANK: That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
MARY: He's better, though, right?
FRANK: ( reluctant ) He's better.
MARY: Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more you know what I mean?
MARCUS: Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
FRANK: Marcus exits.
MARY: I'm not really hungry.
FRANK: It's best not to . It's good pizza, huh?
MARY: Not as good as Nino's.

MARY: Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
FRANK: I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
MARY: On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
FRANK: We moved out after that. Upstate.

FRANK: They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurseI was sort of born to it, I guess.
MARY: You married?
FRANK: Ah, no. I was. It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.

MARY: You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of I think I'd remember that.
FRANK: I think I'd remember that.
MARY: Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
FRANK: Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
MARY: ( wipes her mouth ) I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
FRANK: Frank puts his hand out but she's already on her feet. He grabs the last slice of pizza, hands it to Griss as she heads back to Critical Care.

FRANK: What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule.

NURSE CONSTANCE: Frank walking away, not looking where he's going, backs into Noel's gurney.
NOEL: Excuse me, sir, excuse me, I would please trouble you for one cup of water. The smallest thing in the world to ask for, water. A man is dying and that is me.
HAZMAT: Christ. Who the hell woke him up?
FRANK: Don't give me that look.
MARCUS: What look?
FRANK: You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.

FRANK: I hate vodka.

FRANK: I quit! I'm through!
MARCUS: You can't leave me now.
FRANK: So long, Noel.
GRISS: Your friend there just untied the water beggar. Griss was coming out to thank her. Probably saved Griss a murder charge. Having a tough time of it.
FRANK: Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
MARY: ( steps over ) I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up. I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
FRANK: Don't seem so bad to me.
MARY: Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that. Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's
FRANK: Mary takes a few steps, turns back.
MARY: I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
FRANK: Maybe I should come up with you.
MARY: If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
FRANK: Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
MARY: No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
MARY: I shouldn't have asked you to come.
FRANK: You asked me not to come.
MARY: Promise you won't go inside.
FRANK: Fifteen minutes.
MARY: I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
FRANK: We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
MARY: Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
MARY: You go on home, okay. I'm fine, really. I don't need you. Thanks.
KANITA: Hey Cy, guess who's here?
KANITA: Can I help you?
FRANK: Mary Burke. She's a friend.
KANITA: She's not here.

KANITA: He looks like a cop.
COATES: He's not a cop, he's a medic. I'm CY Coates.
FRANK: Frank Pierce.
COATES: Mary said you might be coming.
FRANK: Where is she?
COATES: Sleeping in the back.
FRANK: She asked me to pick her up.
COATES: I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
FRANK: I better just go in and see her.
COATES: I call this the Oasis. Refuge from the world out there. Did you know two people were shot in this building last week?
FRANK: Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
MARY: ( groggy ) No, no.
COATES: She wanted something to help her Mary, we really have to go.
FRANK: Mary, we really have to go.
COATES: Frank, she's suffered enough. She's okay, I promise. C'mon, Frank.
FRANK: ( sits ) Got a beer? That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
COATES: That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
FRANK: Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
COATES: Red Death? Tell me something, Frankdoes killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
FRANK: I should be going. I just quit.
COATES: Sleep is all stress reduction. Here. You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need. Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frankfor my health? You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.
FRANK: Is this what you gave Mary?
COATES: That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
FRANK: I guess I'll be going.
COATES: Just take it easy.
KANITA: Take my pulse. It's good, isn't it?
FRANK: I knew it. I was wrong about you. You're not so bad.
KANITA: I knew it. I was wrong about you. You're not so bad.
LARRY: You're in the stomach!
FRANK: You sure?

LARRY: Stomach again.
FRANK: No way!
COATES: Frank, take it easy. what happened?
KANITA: He flipped out.
COATES: Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen. Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
KANITA: Stressed? He's psycho.
COATES: Frank, where you going?
MARY: I can walk.
MARY: Let go of me. You shouldn't have come up. I told you not to. You could have gotten us both killed. You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
FRANK: Because you can barely walk.
MARY: You remember Noel, from the other night, how Noel is now? He wasn't always like that. He was my brother's best friend. Cy or Tiger or one of those other goons put a bullet in Noel's head. He was in a coma three months. Crazy ever since.
MARY: What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to I need to sit down a minute.
FRANK: I need to sit down a minute.
MARY: Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
FRANK: Hello, I'm Frank. Mary's friend. A very close friend who loves animals.

BURKE'S VOICE: The heartbeats on monitor return to regular formation.
MILAGROS: Should I increase the lidocaine?
WALLS: Frank, what you doing back there?
FRANK: I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure. Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
WALLS: Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
FRANK: ( pulls off mask ) These are hard times, Tom.
WALLS: Yeah. Great, isn't it?
FRANK: Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
WALLS: Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
FRANK: Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
WALLS: Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
FRANK: The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
WALLS: Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale.
DISPATCHER: Okay, units, it's suicide hour. Fourteen Boy, I show you in the hospital sixty minutes but I know you're in the diner on 14th.

DRUNK #2: He was bleeding before. He kept spilling his beer. I gave him mouth- You're lucky you didn't kill him. We're going to hear it straight from the loony's mouth. Are you crazy? Did you try to bump yourself off?
WALLS: You're lucky you didn't kill him. We're going to hear it straight from the loony's mouth. Are you crazy? Did you try to bump yourself off?
CUT WRISTS: ( salivatory ) Why didn't you say so.
WALLS: Why didn't you say so.
FRANK: This is the worst suicide attempt I've ever seen. You feel the pulse? Here. That's where you cut, and it's not across, it's down like so. Here take it.
CUT WRISTS: ( shaking ) I can't.
FRANK: With all the poor people of this city who wanted only to live and were viciously murdered, you have the nerve to sit here waiting to die and not go through with it. You make me sick. Take it.
WALLS: We cured him, Frank. When we work together there's nothing we can't
WALLS: ( sits ) Sounds like they're trying to clean up the bus terminal tonight,
FRANK: C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.

In front of a liquor store you'll find a forty year-old male, unconscious, lying next to his wheelchair. Do I have to say more?
FRANK: ( to radio ) You've said too much already.
WALLS: Mr. Oh.
FRANK: It's early for him.

FRANK: ( about Coates ) Well, he's the steakhead of the night, I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
WALLS: I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
FRANK: How's he doing?
WALLS: I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
FRANK: Does that hurt?
COATES: ( screams )
FRANK: I don't think you've hurt any major We got to get you off this thing without setting off bleeding.
COATES: I can't hold up my head anymore.
FRANK: You're going to live.

FRANK: I was tired. I needed a coffee.
COATES: What about Kanita?
FRANK: That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me.

FRANK: How many times have you shocked him Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
HAZMAT: Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
FRANK: What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
HAZMAT: ( laughs ) That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
FRANK: A medical miracle.
MARY: Everyone, this is the medic who brought my father in. Frank, these are some of my father's friends.
FAMILY FRIEND: We live out an the Island now, but we used to live right down the block from Pat. He was like a saint to us. Came as soon as we heard.
FRANK: ( to Mary ) I'm going out for a smoke.
MARY: I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
FRANK: He'll be all right.
MARY: Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
FRANK: It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
MARY: OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I saidit was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
FRANK: No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story.

MARY: I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him? That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
FRANK: Can I bring you something back to eata falafal, some pizza?
MARY: No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
FRANK: No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
MARY: This is not a good time.
FRANK: There's no time.

WALLS: Let me think.
FRANK: He's crazy. He can't help it.

FRANK: Okay, whatta I do?
WALLS: If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
