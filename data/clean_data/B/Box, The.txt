WALTER: Yes. Yes it does. She begins to walk down the sidewalk. taunting him as the bus approaches.
NORMA: What if I give little Walter a little kiss in front of all his friends on the school bus? Dana's eyes widen. A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN emerges from behind the scarf that covers the lower part of her face.
DANA: Do it! The bus is fast approaching. brakes squealing as it slows to a stop.
WALTER: Don't come any closer! Norma gives him a big HUG and a KISS right as the bus doors open. A bunch of OLDER KIDS stare out the window. scowling at him. Walter pushes away from her and stomps up onto the bus. mortified. Dana follows him.
NORMA: Dana. you're baby-sitting for us tonight, right?
DANA: Eight o'clock?

ARTHUR: I've got your present at work. It's almost finished. He smiles. then peels off down Monument Ave. From Norma's REAR VIEW MIRROR. Arthur's car disappears down the road. She reaches up to re-adjust. her eyes appear in the mirror's reflection. INSERT: Norma's VIRGINIA license plate. The Oldsmobile drives down the street in the opposite EXT.

CHARLES: Dana saw her take her shoe off in the parking lot yesterday.
DANA: There's definitely something wrong with her foot. It looks mangled.
CHARLES: You didn't say mangled. you said it looked gross. Walter lunges at Charles and pushes him up against the locker. awkwardly trying to fight him.
WALTER: If you ever make fun of my mom again I'll kill you! Walter storms off down the hall.
POATES: The uhhh. the board came to a vote last week, so it's official. They've officially cancelled the faculty tuition discount.

POATES: I'm real sorry about this, Norma.
NORMA: Yeah, me too. I've got three weeks to figure out how to tell my son we can't afford to send him to Collegiate any more. The drop of blood has begun to flow down onto his upper lip.
POATES: Like I said, I'm real sorry.
NORMA: Yeah. your nose is bleeding. Poates reaches for his HANDKERCHIEF and puts it to his face, wiping off the blood. The MORNING BELL rings.
NORMA: Okay. everyone quiet down! Take your seats! Norma moves toward a stack of METAL TRAYS on her desk. Inside of each tray is a BALL OF BLACK MUSH.
CHARLES: Why do they call it an owl pellet? A MALE STUDENT ( 12 ) next to him takes his tray from Norma.
NORMA: Hey. watch the language. You say another cuss word I've gotta send you to detention, okay?
NORMA: Is what true?
NORMA: Yes. this is true. The classroom gasps in disgust. others laugh.
REPORTER #1: It's been five months since the Viking lander touched down on the surface of Mars. We've seen dozens of photographs of the rock covered surface. what can you now tell us about the tests you've been conducting? Is there any sign of life on the red planet? Arthur takes a seat in the back of the auditorium.
CAHILL: Well. there are three separate tests that we've been conducting. Pyrolytic Release, Labeled Release and Gas Exchange. The first two tests, based on soil samples about 22 centimeters deep, came back negative. and the third is. still pending. Cahill smiles. Laughter erupts from various parts of the Can you elaborate on test number Cahill places a transparent MAP of the mars surface on the overhead projector and begins to draw on it with a WAX
REPORTER #1: Can you elaborate on test number Cahill places a transparent MAP of the mars surface on the overhead projector and begins to draw on it with a WAX
CAHILL: The gas exchange experiment measures the production or uptake of C02, nitrogen, methane, hydrogen, and oxygen during the incubation of the martian soil Are you showing us all of the photos? Are there little green men up there? Laughter from the press.
REPORTER #2: Are you showing us all of the photos? Are there little green men up there? Laughter from the press.
CAHILL: Well. there is a possibility that the planet abounds with chemical compounds produced by living systems. Their chemical nature, distribution and structural uniqueness could be used to argue the presence of microscopic living organisms on Mars. As Cahill moves on to the next question. Arthur taps the reporter on the shoulder.
ARTHUR: It all comes down to water. Arthur points to an OVERHEAD SATELLITE PHOTO of Utopia Planitia, a raised level of martian terrain in the vicinity of the site where VIKING II landed. There are dry river-bed formations in the soil.
CAHILL: I'm sorry Arthur, but they've denied your application to be admitted into the astronaut Arthur looks crushed.
ARTHUR: I see.
CAHILL: I'm sorry, son. but they don't tell us why.
ARTHUR: Are they really with-holding some of the Mars photos?
WENDELL: I don't know, man. Jesus. what's that smell?
ARTHUR: It's a salinic compound.
WENDELL: What are you making?
ARTHUR: Christmas present for Norma. Arthur retrieves a WHITE CERAMIC MOLD. The mold has an extrusion that is shaped like a WOMAN'S FOOT. only the end of the foot is round and missing its toes, save for the PINKY
WENDELL: A new prosthesis for her foot?
ARTHUR: Arthur carefully impresses the MOLD of his wife's foot into the pink goop. sealing the mold at the edges into the tray.
WENDELL: What did you change up this time?
ARTHUR: The compound they're developing for the pilot chairs on the space INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB NEXT INSERT: The BONES of a FIELD MOUSE have been re-assembled in rough form within the tray. as the OWL PELLET has been ripped apart. The tray belongs to Charles, and he has grown tired of dissecting the owl pellet. He looks up to the head of the class and sees that Norma is sitting up on her desk. filing her nails. waiting out the last remaining minutes of the period.
CHARLES: Mrs. Lewis?
NORMA: What happened to your foot? She just stares at him.
CHARLES: What happened to your foot? She just stares at him.
NORMA: What happened. to my foot?
CHARLES: ( BEAT )
NORMA: Well. it's a long story. She looks at her watch.
ARTHUR: When she was seventeen. still living in Texas, her brother dropped a barbell on her foot. broke three of her toes.
NORMA: And so I go to see the doctor. He goes to take an X-ray of my foot to see if the bones are broken.
ARTHUR: So this dumb-ass Richmond doctor takes the x-ray. then he goes to check on another patient down the Arthur discards a king.
WENDELL: Jesus. That's not good.
NORMA: They found out that the tissue in four of my toes had been completely
I: destroyed by the radiation. Norma swivels around on the desk and places her right foot against her left inner thigh.
ARTHUR: She had to sit there in a hospital bed in the same position for six months, waiting for it to heal. Wendell stares at the mold on the laboratory table.
WENDELL: Jesus. I hope she sued this idiot.
ARTHUR: Oh yeah. Her family sued. They won.
WENDELL: What was the settlement?
ARTHUR: Forty thousand dollars. Arthur pulls the ceramic mold out of the pink goop. and we see the IMPRESSION of her disfigured foot inside the new
NORMA: You guys want to see it? Now that the secret is out. I don't want you spreading rumors about my mangled foot. The class responds enthusiastically.
ARTHUR: If this sucker works. she can, start jogging again.
DANA: I'm sorry I said that her foot looked gross.
WALTER: It doesn't look gross. it looks cool. And if you can't tell the difference between gross and cool. then I feel sorry for you, Walter walks off. leaving her alone.
NORMA: Hey honey.
WALTER: Why do I need a baby-sitter?
NORMA: Because you're nine years old. You're not a geezer yet.
WALTER: It's 1976, mom. Times are changing. Nine years old isn't what it used to be. I think I'm ready to get a We're not buying you a moped, Walter. Stick with the bike. and be home before dark.
NORMA: We're not buying you a moped, Walter. Stick with the bike. and be home before dark.
WALTER: Walter rides off down the street.
NORMA: There is silence on the other end of the line.
WENDELL: How's the commute back to Richmond?
ARTHUR: Not too bad. Maybe an hour and twenty minutes.
WENDELL: Tell Norma I said hello. Wendell watches him walk across the lawn to the parking lot. approaching his car. He lights a cigarette and takes a drag. then looks at his watch. INSERT: His watch shows that it is 4:58 PM.
ARLINGTON: Mrs. Lewis?
NORMA: My name is Arlington Steward. Her eyes light up, as she remembers the name and the box. Arlington then rotates his body. revealing the RIGHT SIDE of his face. Norma's eyes widen in horror at what she sees. Nearly all of the right side of his face from his cheekbone to his lower jaw has been burned away. His rear MOLARS and GUMS are exposed beneath the absence of tissue that is supposed to conceal them. Norma immediately feels a strange connection. a deep sympathy for him and the pain he must have endured.

ARLINGTON: Well. in a way, yes. I do have an offer to make.
NORMA: Yeah? What are you selling?
ARLINGTON: A financial opportunity. Arlington gestures toward the table with his briefcase.
NORMA: Are you for real? Arlington smiles back at her.
ARLINGTON: Mrs. Lewis, I can assure you that the offer is real.
NORMA: Who do you work for?
ARLINGTON: The guarantee of payment has several restrictions. One. I am not permitted to disclose any information about to the identity of my employers.
NORMA: Wait a minute. you're just going to leave me with this thing.
ARLINGTON: My name is Arlington Steward, and I can assure you that this is no joke. The offer is real, but I am not at liberty to disclose any more information than I already have. He withdraws a BUSINESS CARD and hands it to her.
ARLINGTON STEWARD: She turns the card over and sees what looks like a PHONE NUMBER printed on the back:
WALTER: What do you want?
DANA: I'm sorry. I just wanted to tell you. that I think your mom is Walter just stares at her in silence. wanting to forgive INT.

NORMA: Well. it's been what. thirteen years? Bound to run into each other at some point, right?
NORMA: What's this?
ARTHUR: A little gift from Dr. Rex Morgan. She opens the present and retrieves the PROSTHESIS.
NORMA: Oh my god!
ARTHUR: It's a material they developed for the new shuttle chairs. It'll absorb the pressure of your foot and re-distribute it across the entire surface area. She then slides her disfigured foot into the shoe. and begins to walk around the room.
NORMA: Oh my God, Rex. how'd you do it?
ARTHUR: I just figured out a way to make it She crosses the room and gives him a hug and a kiss.
NORMA: I don't know what I'd do without Merry Christmas, June.

ARTHUR: Yeah. what's it all about. Did he show up?
NORMA: Yeah. I'll tell you about it in the car. We're running late. Norma leans down and kisses Walter on the cheek.
NORMA: And before I could ask him anything else. he got in his car. and he pulled off.
ARTHUR: Did you get the license plate?
NORMA: Your dad is cop, Norma. Always get the license plate number.
ARTHUR: Your dad is cop, Norma. Always get the license plate number.
NORMA: I was little overwhelmed, Arthur.
ARTHUR: Somewhere in the world. someone you do not know will die.

ARTHUR: Did he say how they would die?
NORMA: And he showed you the cash.
ARTHUR: And he showed you the cash.
NORMA: Yeah. He said it was two-hundred thousand. It looked real to me.
ARTHUR: What did he look like?
NORMA: You don't want to know. I think he's a burn victim. Poor thing. half of his face is gone.
ARTHUR: I think maybe he's a life insurance salesman. Maybe that's what it is. It's some kind of survey. We push the button and he offers us a discount on a two-hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. Joke's on us.
NORMA: I think maybe he's a life insurance salesman. Maybe that's what it is. It's some kind of survey. We push the button and he offers us a discount on a two-hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. Joke's on us.

ARTHUR: ( PLAYFUL )
NORMA: Norma reaches over and snaps the dome closed.
ARTHUR: You think it's for real. She takes the box back from him.
NORMA: I don't know. He was. he seemed very sure of himself. If it's some kind of survey. then. he's a really good salesman because I believe him. I believe that he might give us that money.
ARTHUR: Do then you think he's a maniac and he might go kill someone?

ARTHUR: Open the glove compartment. There's a philips head screwdriver in She opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT and retrieves a PHILLIPS HEAD SCREWDRIVER for him.
NORMA: What are you doing? Arthur is now unscrewing the bottom of the box.
ARTHUR: I'm gonna see what's inside of it. He removes the screw. and sees that the wooden base rotates on a ROD MOUNT on the opposite corner. INSIDE. it is completely empty.

NORMA: Why do you get to hold it?
ARTHUR: Because you'll lose it Norma. You can't hold your liquor.

NATHAN: Can you believe it? I survive eighteen months crawlling through the Vietnam jungle and not one bullet so much as grazes my body.
ARTHUR: What'd you ever do to Norma?
NATHAN: I dropped that barbell on her foot when we were kids. That's why she went to get that x-ray. If it wasn't for me. she'd still have all her toes.
ARTHUR: You can't think of it that way.
NATHAN: Why not? It's the truth.
ARTHUR: You didn't leave the x-ray machine on, Dr. Stupid did.
NATHAN: Yeah, but my mistake sent her to Dr. Stupid. so that makes me culpable in the eyes of Buddha.
ARTHUR: You're no more culpable than the company that manufactured the barbell. Stop punishing yourself. Nathan smiles in appreciation and takes a long swig of Jack You know he's here.

DEBORAH: I can't believe they still let him practice medicine.
NORMA: You gotta let it go. You gotta learn to forgive and forget.
SUSAN: I'd be willing to forgive him if he would've just admitted his negligence under oath. The bastard lied. said it was the x-ray machine that malfunctioned. SENATOR GRIFFITH POWELL ( 50s ) and his son EDWARD POWELL ( 20s ), approach. Edward is the husband-to-be.

DANA: What did your dad have to do with the Viking?
WALTER: He helped design the camera. Walter points to a PLASTIC PROTOTYPE MODEL of the VIKING LANDER mounted on a third WORK BENCH at the end of the room. A model of the MARS SURFACE has been re-created and painted with exacting detail.
DANA: How do they get the images back to Radio transmission. They figured out a way to interpret the scan lines and then print them onto How long does it take to transmit back to earth?
WALTER: Radio transmission. They figured out a way to interpret the scan lines and then print them onto How long does it take to transmit back to earth?
DANA: How long does it take to transmit back to earth?
WALTER: About ten hours. Dana looks over at the wall and sees a NEW YORK TIMES FRONT PAGE from September with a large image of MARS on it.

ARTHUR: What if it's someone's baby?

Think of the men on the Apollo thirteen mission. sound familiar? They turn slowly on the dance floor. Arthur closes his eyes. his mind racing. A VOICE breaks through the music.
STUPE: I would like to dance with your wife. Do you mind? Arthur glares at Dr. Stupe.
NORMA: It's okay Arthur. Arthur looks at him. then back at Norma. His face has gone pale and he looks for a moment as though he might faint on the dance floor.
ARTHUR: I.. I. Will you please excuse me? Arthur moves toward the stairs that lead up to the palatial estate. Walter is there. waiting.
WALTER: Dad! What's going on?
ARTHUR: I.. I'm gonna be sick Walter. He places his hand on his son's head for a brief moment and then stumbles up the stairs. ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

STUPE: There is that old cliche. that the lord works in mysterious ways. Well. I have met the lord. I have spoken to him in my dreams. And it brought me back to that day in my office when you arrived with a fractured foot. some thirteen years ago.

RESTON: In the 1940s. when NASA was formed, we began developing, in secret, a project that we dubbed the Prometheus Effect.
TEAGUE: Projecting fictional scenarios about how we would respond, if and when we came into contact with an alien intelligence.
RESTON: If the intelligence had hostile intent. or if it began to somehow display proof of its ability to destroy us, we would have a system in place to begin negotiating with it in secret.
TEAGUE: The goal of Prometheus is to maintain coexistence with this life- form, and eventually achieve peace with it, so that its power can be harnessed, developed and applied in such a manner that will benefit the human race.

ARTHUR: My camera. took this photo.
CAHILL: We've run the data sequence off the server more than a thousand times. Each time. this one photo in the sequence comes out of the dark room just like this. We can't explain Arthur hands the photo back to Cahill.
NORMA: What does it want? Cahill glances at Teague. who looks to Cahill.
CAHILL: I think the same thing that it wanted from Bevilacqua. except that poor boy is no longer around to tell us why he shot his wife.
NORMA: What did he say to you when you were in the car with him?
ARTHUR: Something about breaking the chain. He wanted to find the next test subject. and prevent them from pushing the button. Cahill is writing diligently on his NOTE PAD.

NORMA: What have you done with our son?
ARTHUR: ( under his breath ) You are now presented with two Option one. you enjoy the rest of your lives with the money you have been given, and you learn to live with your son's disability. Reston then reaches into his pocket and retrieves a PISTOL. He places it on the table next to the box.
NORMA: That's not fair.
NORMA: If Arthur has to do it. then I want you to make it look like a suicide. Arthur shouldn't be punished for something that I did.
ARTHUR: Is there an afterlife? The twins smile cryptically in response to Arthur's question.
ARTHUR: Right. I get it. Reston then turns to the window.
ARTHUR: Tell me this isn't happening, This isn't happening. She starts the engine. and they drive off. Arthur watches the parking lot full of MEN reflected back at them in the side-view mirror.

NORMA: Because I was so afraid of losing you to someone prettier than me. Arthur just stares at her. unsure how to respond.
ARTHUR: No. I don't. She manages a smile. A tear rolls down her cheek as she stares out at the pavement and the endless trees lining either side of the interstate.
DANA: Did my dad tell you why he loves you, Norma? Norma realizes that she has been involved all along. Blood drains from her nose.
NORMA: Because you're an amputee. He says that the soul of an amputee leaks out into the wind. searching for the place where there is no longer flesh and bone.

WALTER: Is anyone-there?! He begins clawing at the walls. trying to figure out where he is.

ARTHUR: Arthur. I love you, and I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I did this to us.
NORMA: Arthur. I love you, and I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I did this to us.
ARTHUR: I'm the one who told you to push the button. so don't apologize. He looks out through the window at his back yard. likely for the last time.
NORMA: I'll be waiting. counting the days until my Arthur comes to see INT. WELLER HOUSE BEDROOM NEXT Suzanne Weller smiles at her husband. reaches her finger out and places it on the button. She then presses down.
NORMA: It's going to be harder for you to live than for me to die. Arthur closes his eyes. the noise is excruciating. There is no time to wait any longer.
ARTHUR: Well then.

ARTHUR: Yes. This is Arthur Lewis at 1560 Monument Avenue. I've just shot my wife. can you please send an The Operator begins to ask more questions. but Arthur does not listen. He hangs up the phone. The thumping from upstairs has now subsided.

POLICE OFFICER: BACK AWAY FROM THE DOOR AND PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!! Arthur stares at the officer. frozen. the repercussions of his decision now stare him in the face with a loaded gun.
ARLINGTON: Mrs. Weller. do you have the button unit?
ARTHUR: I'm sorry, Jim. He stares Arthur down as he is put into the back seat of the cruiser. Jim closes the door and goes around to the front of the car. Jim gets behind the wheel and starts the engine. Arthur looks back through the window, toward his house. Upstairs in the MASTER BEDROOM WINDOW. Walter is watching, tears streaming down his face. Arthur reaches up with his hands. cuffed together. and tries his best to wave at his son.
