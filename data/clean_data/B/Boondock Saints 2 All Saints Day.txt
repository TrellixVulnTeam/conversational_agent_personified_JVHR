MURPHY: Looks like a storm's comin'.
CONNOR: EXT. FIELDS LATER MOODY MUSIC: The brothers drive the flock across jewel green hills. Murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it off.
POPPA M: "And they that holdest my name shall come with the shaking of the earth and the roiling of the oceans."
SIBEAL: Something's happened.
REPORTER #1: There is no new information on the victim found slain this morning inside Trinity Church. As you can see the size of the crowd here has increased substantially over the last couple of hours. People are demanding answers as to how a priest could be murdered in a church. But perhaps more shocking, we have confirmed that the body was ritualized with pennies in the eyes. Many remember this as the grisly calling card of the prolific vigilante killers known as the Saints, who went on a murder spree here in Boston.
REPORTER #1: As police have yet to confirm the Saints' possible involvement, the ominous question hangs heavy in the air. "Are they back?"
MURPHY: The priest. Did they release his name?
SIBEAL: No. But I made a few calls, still got some friends in the diocese there. McKinney. Father Douglas McKinney.
CONNOR: Knew of him. Everybody did. A regular Mother Theresa. Youth hostels, soup kitchens. Even made it into the newspapers sometimes.
SIBEAL: Listen boys. I think it's best that ya just stay put and we'll try ta figure out what.
DUFFY: We need to keep our heads, here. It's probably not even them.
DOLLY: Of course it ain't them but that doesn't really matter, does it. Our skeletons just came screaming out of the closet. We're fucked.
DUFFY: We're not fucked.
GREENLY: We are totally fucked!
GREENLY: .and not just fucked, like elephant dick, pounded in the ass, no reach around, jungle fucked!
DUFFY: Now's not the time to panic, Green Oh, I disagree. Now's the perfect time to panic. We're all Accessories to.
GREENLY: Oh, I disagree. Now's the perfect time to panic. We're all Accessories to.
DOLLY: Don't you fucking say it!
OFFICER #1: Her E.T.A. is ten minutes.
DOLLY: I didn't even know he had a protege. What is this bullshit?
DUFFY: Special Agent Eunice Bloom, 32 years old. Smecker plucked her right out of class at Quantico.
GREENLY: Smecker hand picked her? Aw, man. This brawd's gonna be a nightmare.
DUFFY: She was assigned to OCD two years back. She can shoot a gun, set three course records during her training.
GREENLY: Great. A bull dike, Annie Oakley wanna- be. We gotta get rid of her.
DUFFY: She is also an authority on the Saints case. Which means Smecker must have walked her through it.
DOLLY: And the hits just keep on comin'.
POPPA M: Naw.I'm in no condition. I'd just slow 'em down.
SIBEAL: Well, are ya at least gonna try ta talk them out of this?
POPPA M: Aye. Only there's about a thousand easier ways ta do that. Trust me. Someone's callin' them out, Sibeal. Ya kill a priest in a church and make it look like they did it. Bring 'em back with a vengeance. Don't know who. Don't know why. But someone thinks he's real fuckin' clever. Only one problem with his little plan.
SIBEAL: What's dat?
POPPA M: It worked.
SIBEAL: Jesus Christ! D'er's too much we don't know and if you're won't at least try ta talk some sense into them, I will!
MURPHY: Every last motherfucker that had anything to do with it.
DOLLY: Game time. How are we playing this?
DUFFY: Feds love to pull the divide and conquer routine. We hard line her. Stick together on this. Agreed?
DOLLY: Agreed. We're a brick wall.
GREENLY: Let's rock this bitch.
EUNICE: ( POINTING ) You hafta be Detectives Dolly and Duffy. Am I right? ( extending hand ) Eunice Bloom. A pleasure.
GREENLY: T'sup.I mean, what? Yeah, well, funny as in ha ha, though not like funny as in gay cuz.I'm not.played high school football.
DOLLY: Look, with all due respect, Agent Excuse me?
EUNICE: Excuse me?
DOLLY: Excuse me?
EUNICE: You see there's a "special" before my "agent." If we are going to address each other formally, I'd prefer if you popped it in there. Makes me feel, I don't know.special. Of course, I'd hoped we could be a little more personable. In fact, I'd like you to call me Eunice.
DUFFY: O'kay, Eunice. I don't see why the fuck the Fed is.
EUNICE: Whoa, whoa, "fuck?" This isn't a "fuck" situation, is it? I can see a "God Damn" or two but why skip all the way to "fuck" right off the bat? Let's start slow and work our way up to it.
DUFFY: What is the Fed's interest in this?
EUNICE: Their interest, Detective, is capturing the men responsible for the murders of 22 of Boston's finest criminals. Y'see public perception is that these boys stepped in, did our jobs for us and then disappeared into thin air as we fecklessly searched for them. The FBI tends to take exception to such things. They coulda sent anyone. They sent me. Why do you think that is?
DUFFY: The victim was killed late last night. When people gathered for morning mass, they found the front entrance chained and padlocked. A locksmith came out, cut the chain and surprise, surprise. Cell phones. Half of them called the cops. Half of them called the media. But regardless.word's out.
EUNICE: And it looks like that's just the way somebody wanted it. What say we scrape the shit off this cow's ass, fellas? Detective Greenly? Escort a lady onto the crime scene?
GREENLY: What? No, yeah, no. Of course.
EUNICE: Never touch the stuff.
EUNICE: It wasn't them.but I'm sure you boys already knew that.
DUFFY: The two "V's." The victim and venue don't add up.
EUNICE: Let's go with the venue first. Our perpetrators are devout. They would never commit such an act on sacred ground. And as for the victim?
DOLLY: All their vics were criminals. Clearly not the case here. So, it wasn't them which means this is a local matter and it falls under our jurisdiction. No need for Federal involvement so with all due respect.we'll see you later, Special Agent Bloom.
EUNICE: Man, I hate it when people say that. "With all due respect." Because it is inevitably followed by a disrespectful remark. I'll give you an example. With all due respect, Detective, this matter falls under whatever jurisdiction I fuckin' say it does.
DUFFY: Uh, so.let's just.what can you tell us about the shooters?
EUNICE: Shoo-ter. Singular. And I can tell you that he is left handed and how shall I put this delicately.? He's a short bastard.
DOLLY: ( FACETIOUS ) One guy, lefty, short. Got it.
EUNICE: I'll show you what I'm talking about.
EUNICE: Detective Greenly, you're the victim.
GREENLY: David. You can call me David.
EUNICE: Very well, David.
DUFFY: .one guy's holding two guns to the back of your head.
EUNICE: One guy.
EUNICE: Now, the victim falls forward. If you please, David.
DUFFY: Left handed.
EUNICE: Yep, southpaw.
DOLLY: But you said he was wicked short.
EUNICE: The Saints were later determined to be five foot eleven inches tall. It's just dumb luck that the Russian and McKinney are the exact same height.
DOLLY: That puts him at five, seven-ish. That's not uncommonly short.
EUNICE: The killer posed as a late night confessor. Once the victim entered the booth the killer had him isolated. No escape. Short stuff exits his confessional and kicks in the door of the priest's chamber.
WHIP PAN!: INT. BACK TO PRESENT, CHURCH MOMENTS LATER
EUNICE: Gave him a couple inches. We're looking at about five foot five, That's wicked short.
GREENLY: That's wicked short.
EUNICE: EXT. OPEN SEA DAY We drift over open sea to a huge cargo freighter, the Killian Farris, plodding toward Northeast.
DECK HAND: They're brawling in the hold! Better get your bets in now!
CONNOR: Why are his hands chained?
MEXICAN SEAMAN: Romeo's fast, man. He says the Frenchman can't lay a hand on him.
MURPHY: But he can't hit him back.
MEXICAN SEAMAN: That's the bet. He's got to last five This guy's fuckin' crazy.
MURPHY: ( to Connor, English ) This guy's fuckin' crazy.
BOTH: Fifty on the Mexican.
ROMEO: You should never fight a Mexican, Frenchy. Pound for pound, the toughest mother fuckers on earth. Know why? We like pain. We like it, Pierre. I mean think about it, "tabasco sauce." What kinda fucked up people would even invent that shit?
ROMEO: Oh, shit. FIRE! FIRE!
ROUGHNECK #1: Out of zee way!
ROMEO: Whoa! Uh, merci, uh, si vous plait.
MURPHY: Just protectin' our investment. Ya made us fifty bucks.
ROMEO: Oh, thank, God. Irish, huh? Finally some class. I'm Romeo.
CONNOR: ( shaking hands )
MURPHY: Murphy. Why were you yellin' "fire"?
ROMEO: I heard you were supposed to on t.v.
CONNOR: That's if you're gettin' raped.
ROMEO: Oh.I'd be more inclined to go with something like, "THAT DOESN'T GO THERE,
MAN!": They laugh as they move to the semi-conscious Frenchman.
BOTH: Quis praesumis profanus apud Dominus?
BOTH: INT. HIGH CLASS HOME, DINING ROOM NIGHT Rich, Italian decor, long table, laden with food. CAPOS 1-6 sit in utter shock, looking to their boss, CONCEZIO YAKAVETTA ( 37yrs ) who heads the table.
CONCEZIO: So, there it is. I want everyone to feel free to share their thoughts.
CAPO #1: I can't believe none of us were consulted on this! The disrespect! We'd have never okay'd such a thing! A priest! It's an infamita!
CAPO #2: Yeah! Are we not Catholics, for Christ fucking sakes?!
CAPO #3: And just for simple revenge?! There's no business in it! You've put us all at risk here! The cops could be all over us!
CAPO #4: Forget the cops! What about these Saints fuckers?! These guys were long gone! And now you're trying to bring the devil right back to our doorstep?!
CONCEZIO: Six years ago, with the backing of an adoring public, these vigilante fucks put my father on his knees and executed him.in public. Mi Patrigno, a blood relative and benefactor to all of you. Poppa Joe made you rich and his murder remains un-revenged.
CAPO #4: Concezio is right. Pretending you don't got a problem don't solve
CONCEZIO: Thank you, Doctor Phil. So, let's take a moment to look at the serendiplious, diperous, serendip.
CONNOR: The prodigal son, huh? He wants us, he's fuckin' got us.
MURPHY: But why would he do something so Think about it. People figure we did it. Makes it more likely someone will drop a dime. Way easier to get to us in prison, isn't it, now.
CONNOR: Think about it. People figure we did it. Makes it more likely someone will drop a dime. Way easier to get to us in prison, isn't it, now.
MURPHY: But how would anyone recognize us?
CONNOR: You don't remember those sketches on the news channel?
MURPHY: Shit. That's right. Y'know, every time they show those composites on TV and then they catch the guy, it looks nothin' like him. But ours?
CONNOR: Just our luck. We get Leonardo fuckin' Divinci as a sketch artist.
MURPHY: Maybe we should dye our hair.
CONNOR: Yeah. These guys are always dyin' their hair. You know, like in "The Fugitive." It's covert and shit.
MURPHY: Yeah. These guys are always dyin' their hair. You know, like in "The Fugitive." It's covert and shit.
CONNOR: What color would you dye it?
MURPHY: I don't know.lighter, I guess.
CONNOR: I didn't say that!
MURPHY: I didn't say that!
CONNOR: California, surfer boy, gay, gay I'm warnin' ya!
MURPHY: I'm warnin' ya!
CONNOR: Just keep your hands off my ass back there and, "stay gold, Pony Boy."
MURPHY: Fuck you!
CONNOR: Connor bolts up, knocking over the pot. Hot water and pennies spread across the floor. Connor pulls the pen out.
AAAAAH!: Connor bolts up, knocking over the pot. Hot water and pennies spread across the floor. Connor pulls the pen out.
MURPHY: Serves ya right!
ROMEO: Oh, shit.
MURPHY: SHUT IT!
SHUT IT!: Murphy moves behind Romeo, shuts the door and shoves him in.
ROMEO: Oh, this is so fucking cool, man. I'm from Boston. I love you guys. Shit, everybody does! I mean, holy fucking shit! Maybe I could get in on this, you know? Bring some La Raza ta this thing. Spice it up a little. Hey, is it true you guys say a prayer before you grease somebody?
CONNOR: And an awesome wailing was heard throughout heaven.
MURPHY: .as the terrible hand of the Lord struck upon the earth.
CONNOR: And as Almighty God created you.he now calleth you home.
MURPHY: Let's have a shot while we're waitin'.
ROMEO: That shit was NOT funny, man!
CONNOR: But I got conex all over Bean Town. Romeo'll hook you up like a tow truck!
ROMEO: But I got conex all over Bean Town. Romeo'll hook you up like a tow truck!
MURPHY: Why not?!
ROMEO: Why not?!
MURPHY: We don't hafta give you reasons. Forget it.
ROMEO: It's because I'm Mexican, isn't it!
CONNOR: How dare you, sir, insinuate such a thing? The fact that you're a greasy spic's got nothin' ta do with it.
ROMEO: I'm gonna let you have that one. Look. I can do this. It's not rocket science. You two find bad guys doing bad shit and you kill them, right?
CONNOR: It's not that simple.
MURPHY: Yes it is.
CONNOR: S'pose you're right. I'd sorta hoped we were a little more artistic than that.
ROMEO: Well, you ain't. Can't you guys see it? This shit's fate, man. Like preordained type shit. Mea fucking Culpa! Why do you think you just happened to be in that hatchway today?
MURPHY: Oh, don't start gettin' all super fuckin' natural on us. We saw those guys goin' in there!
ROMEO: Ah, ha! That's what you say. I say it's because Jeeeeesus wanted it that way!
CONNOR: Oh, no.
ROMEO: Fine. Then what exactly do you intend to do when you hit U.S. soil?
CONNOR: We'll go after all Yakavetta's people and operations till we get to the man Yeah, work our way up the food chain.
MURPHY: Yeah, work our way up the food chain.
ROMEO: So, what's your first gig? What's the first thing you gonna do?
CONNOR: Well, I don't suppose we have a succinct plan, y'know, per se.
MURPHY: Yeah. It's not fully developed yet, y'know, as it were.
ROMEO: You two need to chill in the green room, sip on some Pellegrinos and let your manager handle the details. And you better get my Cub Scout badge ready. Cuz if you want to kick Yakavetta in the nuts, let him know you're in town.Romeo's got an ace in the hole for you.
CAB DRIVER: I think it's disgusting. I wish they'd have stayed gone.
PEDESTRIAN: I don't believe it for a second! No bleep-in way the Saints did it!
EUNICE: And that's all she wrote. Everything points in the same direction.
CHIEF: Why would Yakavetta want them back here? Him of all people.
DUFFY: To have them executed. Revenge. Oldest motive in the book.
GREENLY: The Saints killed his daddy six years ago, right? He was inside when that happened doing a nickel for extortion.
DOLLY: Yeah. From inside he could only do so much. Since he got out nine months ago, the Yakavetta's have regained their original strength. Looks like their clearing all their open accounts.
CHIEF: Well.it's a theory.
EUNICE: More than just a theory, Chief.
DUFFY: C.I.'s came back. Cold hits all around. Concezio Yakavetta and his six Capo Regime, all blood relatives, have So, it fits. He's gone to the mattresses with his top brass. He's protecting them till this is over.
CHIEF: So, it fits. He's gone to the mattresses with his top brass. He's protecting them till this is over.
GREENLY: So, it fits. He's gone to the mattresses with his top brass. He's protecting them till this is over.
EUNICE: And word's been put to all his lieutenants that the Saints are to be taken out, on sight.
DOLLY: That means his resources on the streets are battening down the hatches, waiting for them to show.
CHIEF: Look, I been stone walling the media on this thing but the Mayor's been riding me like a rented mule here. I got half of New England thinking the Saints whacked a priest and the other half thinking their innocent. Its a powder keg. I'm talking riot gear at Celtics games, here. I could clear them of this murder, take the piss right out of this thing, keep the peace in the Commonwealth. Gimme one good reason why I shouldn't go public right now.
EUNICE: Walk with me, Chief. Let's talk.
DUFFY: This is not good. She's gunning for the boys hard.
DOLLY: This brawd, trying to put a feather in her cap is gonna get us locked up.
DUFFY: Just calm down.
GREENLY: And you know they'll send us to the Hoag. We put half those deranged sex freaks in there. I hope you guys like cock sandwiches. Cuz we'll be eating them for breakfast, lunch and dinner!
EUNICE: I understand you got a job to do, Chief. But if Yakavetta even sniffs that we're onto him, he puts a bullet in Napoleon's head, plants him at the bottom of the ocean and walks. This pint sized killer is the only thing that puts Yakavetta right in the middle of this. It is imperative that we find this man.
DUFFY: We need to figure what we're gonna do when the boys show and start doin' what they do best. Cuz that's when the shit's really gonna hit the fan.
DOLLY: That's another thing. Everyone's assuming that they're going to come back. I mean, we got no way of knowing that for sure.
GREENLY: ( ray of hope ) Yeah. That could totally happen. They could not come back.
DUFFY: What dream world did you two just slip
ROMEO: It's been all over the papers the last two years. Yakavetta's in bed with the Chinese. They're using international shipping routes to smuggle it in. This is Little Yaka's shit.
CONNOR: Let's follow 'em down the rabbit hole,
MURPHY: You just scored a few points, Rome.
ROMEO: Well, dust off my "Members Only" Cuz the kid has also supplied the ride!
MURPHY: I thought you said your car was I don't like words that got 'spic' right in the middle. Besides, it is.where I live.
ROMEO: I don't like words that got 'spic' right in the middle. Besides, it is.where I live.
MURPHY: Where's that? Pimpville?
ROMEO: Hey! I hail from a colorful people. Besides, you wouldn't know style if it pitched a tent in your ass! What do you think of the ride, Conman?
CONNOR: The only way I could be more embarrassed right now is if I was ridin' a moped.
MURPHY: Yeah.while fuckin' a fat girl.
CONNOR: Yeah.rollin' through the gym at my high school reunion.
ROMEO: All right! I get the fucking point!
CONNOR: O'kay, here's the plan.
CONNOR: We skin out, go ta Doc's for a shot of Irish. We're home in time for tacos.
MURPHY: Well, it's.uh.you know, it's.
ROMEO: It's genius. I can even drive an F- lift, man. Got my class "D" license and everything.
CONNOR: Now, dat's the spirit.
ROMEO: I need a gun.
ROMEO: What the fuck? I'm in on this shit, man! I'm working here!
CONNOR: You can consider yourself a fuckin' pledge until we say different.
ROMEO: Can I consider myself your girlfriend, That's what you get. Is there a It's fine.
CONNOR: That's what you get. Is there a It's fine.
ROMEO: ( beat, fuming ) It's fine.
MURPHY: Don't worry, Rome. Shit like this builds character.
ROMEO: Yeah, the character of a little bitch.
MURPHY: Now, dat's just unprofessional.
CONNOR: I think Yakavetta murdered a good man just to send us a message.
MURPHY: Well.let's send him one back.
DOLLY: ( re: Greenly )
DUFFY: I don't know.
CHIEF: Your boss, John Kuntsler called. Tells me you got a problem with authority.
EUNICE: Absolute horse pucky, Chief. Unfortunately, authority's developed a problem with me.
CHIEF: And what's that?
EUNICE: Well, y'see, I am currently in possession of a vagina.
CHIEF: Oh, Jeez, that's not.
EUNICE: So you spoke to Kuntsler. Anything
CHIEF: If it's confirmed that the Saints are back and too many bodies start showing up with pocket change. .he's gonna pull you and step in.
EUNICE: Message delivered, Chief.
CHIEF: Listen. I'll fend him off. Just work
GREENLY: It's not them.
EUNICE: It's them.
DOLLY: What do you think happened here?
EUNICE: Oh, this was a plan that fell to pieces. A lot here doesn't make sense which is why it makes perfect sense. I believe things in our fair little city just got downright biblical.
DOCK WORKER: You didn't have to bash me in the Sorry, man. We got a plan going, here. Technically, I was supposed to knock you out.
ROMEO: Sorry, man. We got a plan going, here. Technically, I was supposed to knock you out.
DOCK WORKER: Christ! You got a gun. You could have just pointed it at me and said SCRAM!
CONNOR: DOCK WORKER
SCRAM!: DOCK WORKER
DOCK WORKER: You got it!
ROMEO: So, let's not let this one, small incident get in the way of.
CONNOR: Shut up and get behind the fuckin'
MURPHY: Well, at least the plan is off to a winning start.
CONNOR: Go fuck y'rself.
MURPHY: How the fuck would you know?
CONNOR: Fuck you. I know shit.
MURPHY: Jesus! What the fuck's he doin'?!
CONNOR: He can't see where he's goin'!
MURPHY: Shit! Tell him to go left, now!
CONNOR: Go left! Go left!
ROMEO: Connor sticks his finger out the hole and points. Romeo wrenches the wheel and they narrowly avoid machinery. The crate rocks.
MURPHY: I can't fuckin' believe I let you talk me into this! This is a stupid plan!
CONNOR: I didn't notice you throwin' out any ideas, ya creative asshole!
MURPHY: Fuck you!
ROMEO: Hey! What's goin' on in there?!
MURPHY: Jesus Christ! Tell him to stop!
CONNOR: BRAKES! BRAKES! BRAKES!
BROTHERS: And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my Lord, for Thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, that our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command. So, we shall flow a river forth to Thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be.
DOLLY: Just got a call from my best snitch. Never steered me wrong. He says its this guy. "Gorgeous" George Tuffano. He's trusted bruglione to Yakavetta but not blood. He's been left control of the streets. He's running all of it.
GREENLY: They call him "Gorgeous" cuz he likes his silk suits and jewelry. He's even got the 'out of season' fake bake going on, a real peacock, this guy.
EUNICE: Yeah, I heard of this rodeo clown.
DUFFY: Ballistics just dug it out.
EUNICE: A twenty two? You gotta be kidding me. That's like bringing a knife to a Yeah, or like bringing a really small gun.to a gunfight.
GREENLY: Yeah, or like bringing a really small gun.to a gunfight.
DUFFY: I don't know. Ballistics is reading three shooters. This is one of them.
EUNICE: Well, I'm having a hard time believing that one of the three most lethal individuals on the planet just switched over to bird shot.
DOLLY: Maybe we're reading it wrong. The priest was a frame job, right?
DUFFY: Yeah, maybe somebody's trying to eliminate some competition here.
EUNICE: No, sir. It's them. But we just might have ourselves a change in the line up,
GREENLY: Fine, they're back. What's the plan?
EUNICE: Hell, we've just been called up to the big show. We are tracking multiple perpetrators, gentlemen. The plan? We keep our ear to the ground and try to figure out where Yakavetta's hiding. Napoleon. We find him and flip him. And as for the Saints.I'm gonna have me a face to face with these boys one way or the other.
DOLLY: INT. GREENHOUSE NIGHT We see the hands of an OLD MAN ( 70 ) as he mists flowers in this lush environment. He ambles to a shop table, wearing a metal leg brace, circa 1950's and a corrective shoe, Polio. We do not see his face.

BOYS!: The brothers and Doc hug and greet as he ushers them in with Romeo in tow. The bar is closed, empty.
CONNOR: Sound as an Irish pound, Doc.
MURPHY: Is it too late for a shot?
DOC: Oh, the Lord told me you'd be comin! He said, "Doc, they're comin" and I was ta get everting ready. So I did. Everting's ruh, ruh, ruh, it's all set.

AAAAAH!: George involuntarily jerks and rolls off the table.
EUNICE: What did you just call me?
GEORGE: Who are you?
EUNICE: Why, I'm a lady, George. That fact alone demands a certain amount of. I'm, I'm sorry I called you that.
GEORGE: I'm, I'm sorry I called you that.
EUNICE: Well, how courteous of you to apologize. Courtesy is so important. Don't you agree?
GEORGE: Y, yeah.I'm with that.
EUNICE: Good. Now sit your fat ass down.
GEORGE: I don't know.
EUNICE: Yeah. There's a lot of stuff you don't know, Hoss. For instance, why aren't you safely tucked away in some ivory tower with all the other big wigs, sucking on cannoli and shrimp cocktail? Why are you the one he left on the streets, George?
GEORGE: Someone's gotta run our legitimate businesses. Someone's gotta make sure Someone's gotta chum the waters.
EUNICE: Someone's gotta chum the waters.
GEORGE: That's bullshit and I ain't saying another fucking word to you.
EUNICE: Good. Then you can just listen. The jig is up. We know Concezio had that priest killed.
CESAR: Word is, Yakavetta's gunning for you boys hard. The whole city's on edge. I even heard he posted a reward like Jesse James style and shit. Any of his guys that take you out gets his palm crossed, two hundred and fifty grand.
ROMEO: Whew. A quarter of a mill for us?
CESAR: Us? What the fuck are you talking about "us?"
ROMEO: Uncle, why do you have to disrespect me in front of them?!
CESAR: Cool it, Mr. Big Shot! A year ago you were washing my pots and pans!
ROMEO: Well, I don't wash fucking pots anymore! I'm part of this, Uncle!
CESAR: Hey! This isn't my first bar-b-que! Now shut up and stop interrupting! Let me talk to them and I'll figure out whether your in on this or in your own fucking fantasy world!
MURPHY: He's in. All the way in.
CESAR: Is my nephew pulling his weight?
CONNOR: Mucho corazon.
CESAR: Gorgeous George is running the show for Little Yaka. Drugs, prostitution, sharking, the whole cha cha. If anybody knows where he is, it's that fat fucking pedico. I'll put it out on the wire.
MURPHY: Hey, uh, maybe we should.
CONNOR: Shut up. Romeo's crying.
ROMEO: You fucking assholes!

CONCEZIO: I can hear you fine, Smokey and the Bandit. Now, what the fuck are you doing here?
GEORGE: Everything's in motion. All our guys are gunning for these Jesus Freaks. I figure, no need for me to be on the streets no more. So, which room do I take, eh?
CONCEZIO: You stupid motherfucker! I told you, you're on the streets till this is over! Now get the fuck outta here!
JO JO: A priest. The sick fuck.
GEORGE: And he leaves all of us on the streets holding the bag while him and his are living it up at the Taj fuckin' Majal, not a care in the world.
JO JO: So, until the Saints get popped, we're all lambs to slaughter?
GEORGE: Yeah! And he don't care how many of us they wipe out in the meantime!
JO JO: What do you need me to do, Skipper?
GEORGE: Spread the word to all the brugliones. No bullshit. From your mouth to their Everyone? North and South? That could get a little dicey.
JO JO: Everyone? North and South? That could get a little dicey.
GEORGE: Fuck their old grudges. All of them are in this, like it or not. Tell them everything we discussed.
JO JO: Even the panic room thing?
GEORGE: JO JO
JO JO: Good. That's a nice ice breaker. They'll get a kick outta that. I didn't even know those things were real. I thought they made that shit up for that movie? With that brawd and that kid? With those guys in that Panic Room?

GREENLY: Tap's up and running on George's cell.
EUNICE: ( holds up baggy ) What's this?
GREENLY: Rosary bead. They found it pushed into the carpet near the victim. Father McKinney wasn't wearing a rosary so it's probably been there a while.
DUFFY: The results on all 864 prints found at the scene. All match churchgoers or clergy but one. The partial on the priest's watch is still unidentified.
EUNICE: That's horse shit. Everyone gets printed nowadays. They're inking up snotgobblers in kindergarten, now.
DOLLY: It's a brick wall anyway. We know Napoleon was wearing gloves. Lab got zilch off the chain and lock. The pennies came up clean too.
EUNICE: ( FRUSTRATED ) I'm gonna go powder my nose.
GREENLY: Aw, man. Daddy would knock that out like Mike Tyson.
EUNICE: McKinney wore his watch on his left
DUFFY: Right here, off his left elbow. Where are you going with this?
EUNICE: Dolly, get on the phone! Find out which wrist he wore his rosary on and if he was wearing it that night! Duffy, run that partial through DMV! David put it through INTERpol! Just get an I.D.! Now! Come on! Vamoose!
MURPHY: What the.did they use his mug shot?
CONNOR: What? No.
MURPHY: You remember how he told us he was embarrassed cuz the guy had to hold up all his long hair behind his head?
CONNOR: Look at that.
MURPHY: Look at that.
CONNOR: Oh.that's fuckin' harsh.
MURPHY: Y'er one of a kind, Roc.
ROMEO: So, am I as good as this guy, or what?
CONNOR: You, sir, are no David Della Rocco.
ROY: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Holy shit! HOLY SHIT! You're the Saints! I'm Roy, it's an honor. Huge fan!

GEORGE: Nobody forgot what you guys did to us last time. They're staying indoors. I give out the location an hour before.
ROMEO: My Uncle's place is closed tonight. I got the key.
MURPHY: It's down by the docks. Dead as a doornail at night.
CONNOR: Yeah. You could set off fourth of July fireworks in dat place and nobody would hear. How's Mexican for you, George?
GEORGE: No difference to me. I think I just shit my Speedos, anyway.
EUNICE: How do, David?
GREENLY: Hey, DMV came up dry on the partial. INTERpol's still working it. Should only be another couple of hours.
EUNICE: Lovely. Anything else?
GREENLY: Yeah. Nothing big. We just dumped a text message from George's cell. Just two words. "El Cava." It's a Mexican joint down by the docks. He sent it to his enforcer, Jo Jo Rhama. Guess gangsters gotta eat too, huh?
EUNICE: I think I'll drop in on their supper, see if I can shake them up a little.
GREENLY: You need a body guard?
EUNICE: No thank you, Mike Tyson. Bye now.
GREENLY: She hangs up and we are left with Greenly. Red handed.
GEORGE: Just two more to go. Uh.You guys are gonna let me go, right?
MURPHY: We'll see, won't we.
GEORGE: Jesus, this is some embarrassing shit.
ROMEO: Si, muchachos.
ROMEO: These dagos are getting antsy and I'm getting Spicaroo'd and Pepe'd. The kid's about to go Poncho fucking Villa out there!
CONNOR: Stick it out. Waitin' on one more.
CREW CUT: He is not with them.
OLD MAN: Are you certain?
CREW CUT: Yes. It is only the sons. They have a Spaniard with them. They will slaughter everyone.
OLD MAN: Let them. If you kill the sons.the father will come.
CONNOR: The gang's all here.
ROMEO: Gimme my fucking bee bee gun.
MURPHY: Naw. You've earned your stripes, Rome.
JO JO: So..where's Gorgeous?
MURPHY: It's Irish for "You're fucked."
ROMEO: Viva La Mejico, bitches!
GEORGE: Uh, I've seen the light! You guys have really turned me around on this! I'm like born again and shit! I swear!
MURPHY: ( to Connor ) What do ya think? Let him go?
CONNOR: We'll let God decide if you get a second chance.
MURPHY: Now, that was, perhaps the finest example of spiritual guidance that I have ever had the good fortune ta Well, thank you very much. Mysterious ways. Mysterious ways.
CONNOR: Well, thank you very much. Mysterious ways. Mysterious ways.
EUNICE: Easy fellas. I'm alone.
ROMEO: He's gone.

EUNICE: And you have mine.
CONNOR: Very well.Connor, Murphy.
CONNOR: Very well.Connor, Murphy.
MURPHY: Very well.Connor, Murphy.
EUNICE: Very well.Connor, Murphy.
ROMEO: Who the fuck was that guy?!
EUNICE: That, I suspect, was the shooter you boys have been looking for.
ROMEO: Fucking.what the fuck?! Who the fuck is this brawd?! And what the fuck's going on, here?!
EUNICE: Let's speed this up before your new sidekick's got to dig any deeper into his impressive vocabulary.
ROMEO: Oh, no you didn't.
EUNICE: I am an FBI agent who is controlling this investigation from within, in order to ensure that you gentlemen never see the inside of a prison cell. I am conspiring to do this with three like minded individuals who have aided you in the past. Though I have yet to inform them of my agenda because, well, girl's gotta have her fun.
MURPHY: Dolly, Duffy and Greenly?
EUNICE: The very same.
CONNOR: How are the lads?
EUNICE: Two of them are scared. One's just Bet'cha I can guess which one.
MURPHY: Bet'cha I can guess which one.
EUNICE: Bet'cha can but let's save it for group. Right now, we have a big What's that?
CONNOR: What's that?
EUNICE: This.simply won't do. We made a deal. The big fish step in if your body count gets too high and. .you have been very naughty boys.
EUNICE: O'kay. Here's how it all went down.
EUNICE: A secret gathering of the Brugliones. The topic of discussion? Weak leadership and betrayal.
EUNICE: The enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, even with all their old .I say fuck the Yakavettas.
EUNICE: And there it is. Guess what comes
EUNICE: Ah. Easier uttered than accomplished. The North End and the South End may as well be the Hetfields and the McCoys. These fellas.they just don't get on.
EUNICE: Oh, the cliche. A Mexican stand off in a Mexican restaurant.
EUNICE: Yakavetta's lost control of the They're fighting over his throne. This was not the work of the Saints.
GREENLY: INTERpol came through.
EUNICE: Are you ready for your fifteen minutes, That ain't all. Short stuff's work visa was signed by a sponsor that doesn't exist and look at the date. Two months after Nine Eleven.
GREENLY: That ain't all. Short stuff's work visa was signed by a sponsor that doesn't exist and look at the date. Two months after Nine Eleven.
EUNICE: Someone maneuvered it through the system using false information during the highest alert in U.S. history.
DOLLY: Yakavetta's just a gangster. He ain't got the juice to pull that off.
EUNICE: You're darn tootin' he don't.
GREENLY: INS red flagged it like a motherfucker. It's a shit storm.
EUNICE: Something stanks like manure.
DOLLY: What is this? Where are we going?
EUNICE: It's time to revisit the scene of the
GREENLY: It's after hours. I mean, if you wanted a drink then.
EUNICE: 37 bodies later and we're finally back where it all began. Y'ever heard of the southern expression, "We have an elephant in the living room?"
DUFFY: You knew all along.
CONNOR: What? Ya don't call. Ya don't write.
MURPHY: I'm glad we got the band back .even though our new bass player's kind of a retard.
CONNOR: So, where'd you learn ta shoot like My Daddy was an old six gun shooter. A real cowboy.
EUNICE: My Daddy was an old six gun shooter. A real cowboy.
MURPHY: Guess that makes you a cowgirl, eh? Thanks. Saved our asses.
EUNICE: Don't mention it. Now, we have a little business to go over before you celebrate in earnest.
CONNOR: This is the guy?
EUNICE: That's the guy. He's a Sicilian immigrant, name of Ottilio Panza.
MURPHY: Five, five? He's short bastard isn't Yes.and well put. He'll be front page news in the morning but we have to assume Yakavetta already knows we've ID'd his guy. We can't give him time to 'Plan B' us.
EUNICE: Yes.and well put. He'll be front page news in the morning but we have to assume Yakavetta already knows we've ID'd his guy. We can't give him time to 'Plan B' us.
MURPHY: We're hittin' him tomorrow night. Dat soon enough?
EUNICE: Should be. Where's it gonna happen?
CONNOR: The Pru.
DOLLY: The Prudential Building? What are you, Why don't you just do it on center ice at a fucking Bruin's game?!
GREENLY: Why don't you just do it on center ice at a fucking Bruin's game?!
CONNOR: Dat's where the man is so dat's where we're goin'. No guts no glory, Green In fact, we could use a few extra hands.that is if you fellas can still get yer Irish on.
MURPHY: In fact, we could use a few extra hands.that is if you fellas can still get yer Irish on.
GREENLY: Hey, I got balls for days, pally. I'm a fucking sack-o-matic.
EUNICE: ( to all ) Well, you boys have fun. Connor, Murphy? Escort a lady to the door?
CONNOR: Y'sure you don't wanna hear the plan? I'm not tryin' ta brag or nothin' but this one's a real Picasso.
MURPHY: Aw, Jesus.
CONNOR: School night. Got some homework to do. Besides, I'd like to critique your masterpiece with a fresh eye.
EUNICE: School night. Got some homework to do. Besides, I'd like to critique your masterpiece with a fresh eye.
MURPHY: What is it?
EUNICE: Something ain't right with this whole thing. Panza knew you were in there tonight and he just let it happen. Didn't lift a finger. I mean, if he's working for Yakavetta, why would he stand by and just watch all his guys get taken out?
MURPHY: That is.interestin'.
CONNOR: You think maybe we got another fox in the hen house here?
EUNICE: Starting ta look that way. Somebody pushed that visa through. Could have ourselves a gen-u-ine 'Ghost in the Darkness,' here.
CREW CUT: They still live.What if he does not come? What if.
OLD MAN: Shhhhh. He will come.
GUN DEALER: Expanded my operation, since I saw ya last. Word got out who may or may not have outfitted ya. Turns out ya got quite the underground followin'.
GUN DEALER: Please, gentlemen. Preferred customers select from my private reserve.
MURPHY: I feel like that kid who found the gold ticket in the candy bar in "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."
GUN DEALER: ( picks up gun ) And I want an Oompa Loompa now, Daddy,
CONNOR: ( picks up gun ) And I want an Oompa Loompa now, Daddy,
GUN DEALER: Full accessory packages. I'm sure you'll find them useful.
ROMEO: I'll take these.
MURPHY: Have you been crying again?
ROMEO: Yeah! Tears of joy! How much?
GUN DEALER: You guys are on the house.
MURPHY: ( to Romeo ) Let's see.
ROMEO: Are you saying I look gay?!
CONNOR: Are you saying I look gay?!
ROMEO: Are you saying I look gay?!
MURPHY: No. You just hail from a colorful.
ROMEO: ( to Dealer ) You don't know me. You think these make me look gay?
GUN DEALER: You look like you might have seen one up close.
OLD MAN: He ambles into the house and to a.
OLD MAN: Foolish, arrogant boy! What have you
CONCEZIO: That wiley old fox not as clever as we thought. Or maybe he played me from the git. Y-you think he played me?
JIMMY: Uh, Boss. Maybe you aught not to be telling me this stuff. I'm just.
CONCEZIO: A little sensitivity, huh? You heartless cocksucker! I need to vindicate my feelings here! I can't tell those goombas outside! They'll serve up my balls over a plate of fucking spaghetti!
CAPO #4: Fuck that. We got a mutiny on our hands. Every ten cent wanna be with a gun is moving on us all over town.
CAPO #3: Yeah and our fearless leader ain't even come out of his little pussy room yet.
CONCEZIO: I want each of you to call your top button man. The best you got. I want them all here tonight. We rip this city a new asshole. It's time for us to reconnoiter our strength on the streets. We seize the day starting now.Carpel Tunnel, gentlemen, Carpel
CAPO #5: Glad to see you back among the living,
DOLLY: God speed.
MURPHY: Out with it! What the hell's the matter with ya?
ROMEO: Out with it! What the hell's the matter with ya?
CONNOR: Out with it! What the hell's the matter with ya?
ROMEO: Nothing! It's just.this is some heavy shit.
CONNOR: Ya did fine at your uncle's place.
ROMEO: Yeah, but we're going off a new script here. I'm just having a.period of You're about to have a period of gettin' yer ass beat!
MURPHY: You're about to have a period of gettin' yer ass beat!
ROMEO: Hey! You two ain't the only ones rollin' with no health insurance! Just let me do my thing. I'm absorbing this.
CONNOR: This is not the time for you to be absorbin' shit! Now, if ya freeze up when you get in there just point yer gay guns at 'em and fer Christ sakes, at least try ta look cool!
MURPHY: I thought you were all hot fer dis!
ROMEO: Oh, I'm hot! I'm fucking red hot! The kid's flamin' like Matt Damon in the Grande Camens!
CONNOR: This is you. Be on time.
ROMEO: I'll be there.
CONNOR: You ready fer dis shit, my dear Let's do some gratuitous violence.
MURPHY: ( cocking .50 cal ) Let's do some gratuitous violence.
EUNICE: ( to herself ) On a sultry Saturday in September the Saints saved seventeen souls.try saying that five times fast.
GREENLY: Come on. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's all over.
KUNTSLER: Special Agent Bloom! You are hereby relieved of all obligation to this
EUNICE: Just fine.Cunty.
KUNTSLER: Nice little science project you got going with these three goofballs. You trying to turn them into your own little junior G-men? Well, you can put sprinkles on shit, Bloom, but it's still shit. So, you and your Keystone Cops can all go home now and let the professionals handle this?
EUNICE: Boy. I'd love to hear a gen-u-wine professional's assessment of a crime scene. How 'bout you, detectives?
KUNTSLER: O'kay. Seems pretty obvious. The door was broken down. We've got our point of entry. The assailants fired in this
EUNICE: There are three inaccuracies in what you just said. Number one, David.
GREENLY: If the windows were shattered by gunfire coming from inside the room, the glass would have been blown outward. As you can see, most of it is on the inside.
EUNICE: Number two, Dolly.
DOLLY: Blood splatters in the direction of the rounds fired. If the assailants discharged toward the windows, the blood would follow suit. Here, the majority of splatter is in the opposing
EUNICE: Number three, Duffy.
DUFFY: Trick question. There is no number three. He only fucked up twice.
EUNICE: ( WHISTLES ) Looks like Bloomy aced her science
KUNTSLER: That was just off the.I would have seen the blood thing.I haven't even had time to.
EUNICE: Why don't you let me take a crack at it, John? Won't cost you nuthin'.
KUNTSLER: And just why would I do that?
EUNICE: Cuz, tonight.mamma's right on time.
EUNICE: This evening's topic of discussion? Desperate times require desperate Desperate times require.some, you know, some desperate shit. Starting tonight, every one of you fat fucking slobs is back on the streets and earning your daily bread.
CONCEZIO: Desperate times require.some, you know, some desperate shit. Starting tonight, every one of you fat fucking slobs is back on the streets and earning your daily bread.
EUNICE: Which brings us to the relevance of our new guests.
CONCEZIO: ( to button men ) Each one of you is to stick to the guy that called you here like glue. You arm yourselves to the teeth, pick your own crews. These bible banging psychos will make an attempt. It's your job to blow their souless hearts out of their It's time to reclaim the streets with an iron fist.
EUNICE: It's time to reclaim the streets with an iron fist.
CONCEZIO: We gotta take back what's ours with some sincere ironfistery.
EUNICE: Let's explain the glass, now. Why is most of it inside the room?
CONNOR: Creative! It's a creative plan!
MURPHY: It's ridiculous! Probably based on some stupid shit ya saw in a movie! And here I am AGAIN all tyin' myself up with rope! What is the deal with you and rope?! Honestly!
CONNOR: It happens ta be a useful thing!
DUFFY: You didn't get this from a movie.did
CONNOR: The "Eiger Sanction," Clint Eastwood! And it worked like a fucking charm for
ROMEO: O'kay Lloyd Cranston of 135 Liberty Lane, apartment 3C. Lovely wife and kids. How old are they? Nevermind. Here's the situation, Lloyd. Me and a couple of friends of mine are fittin' to do some killin' here tonight. I'm talking bullets and blood, custom-wholesale slaughter. You following me, Lloyd-O? Good. Now, I've run into a little snag. I need to figure out a tag line. You know, something cool to say when it's all over like."I'll be back," but mine, y'know? I need to own this one. I think this'll help me get through the quote, unquote event. I'm going to take your gag off and you and me are going to riff a little, o'kay? Let's have fun with this.
LLOYD: I can't believe you! I'm a fucking janitor. What do I know about bullets and slaughter and shit?
ROMEO: Not riffing, Lloyd! Now, I need an "Hasta La Vista" line, toute fucking suite and you're gonna help me think of
EUNICE: And you can count on it like the U.S. mail. Through rain, sleet, hail or snow.something always seems to go wrong for these poor sons o' guns.
CONNOR: What the fuck?
GREENLY: ( hitting controls ) I don't know! It just stopped!
MURPHY: Well, get it fuckin' goin' again!
GREENLY: It won't turn back on! It just died!
BROTHERS: OH, SHIT!
OH, SHIT!: The boys look over the edge. Long way down.
CONNOR: How much time?!
DUFFY: ( looks at watch ) Sixty Seconds!
MURPHY: We gotta go now!
DUFFY: What are you talking about!?
CONNOR: If we're even a few seconds late, Romeo's dead! We gotta go! We're down thirteen stories!
MURPHY: Eleven more to go! Ball park it!
BROTHERS: One floor, two, three.
MURPHY: ( MIFFED ) The fuckin' Eiger Sanction.
LLOYD: Uh."Take that, suckers!"
ROMEO: Not cool enough.
LLOYD: Uh, "Merry Christmas, mother fuckers!"
ROMEO: Too sacrilegious.
LLOYD: Oh God, uh, how about "Eat it!"
ROMEO: What are we at, a buffet, now?
LLOYD: Good God, man! I'm a.
ROMEO: Hang on, you might be onto something with the buffet thing, like with food, y'know? Let's brainstorm on that idea for a minute.
MURPHY: JESUS CHRIST! SEVEN SECONDS.SIX.

EUNICE: YEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAW!!!
YEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAW!!!: Soon it is over. The brothers slam Concezio to his knees and level to the back of his head. As he begs for his life.
BOTH: And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my Lord, for Thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, that our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command.
ROMEO: "Who ordered the whup ass fajita!?"
MURPHY: Whup ass fajita?

EUNICE: And that, gentlemen.is the sound of the fat lady singin'.
GREENLY: Should we.clap or something?
DUFFY: Shut up.
KUNTSLER: Duffy bangs on the door.
DUFFY: Eunice! Oh, shit! Eunice!
GREENLY: If you hurt her, you piece of shit, I will kill you! Do you fucking hear, me? I'll kill you!
JIMMY: I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I wasn't gonna hurt you!
EUNICE: You bet your ass you weren't.
JIMMY: Just lemme explain. I have information, like pertinent information. Ouch! Look, I was listening to you out there and that's, like, exactly what happened. That's what made me think you were the person to talk to.
EUNICE: Yakavetta had a partner, didn't he.
JIMMY: You saw this fella?
EUNICE: You saw this fella?
JIMMY: Yeah. It was only one time and just for a second but I think I could ID him. I don't know his name, though. Concezio always called him the "Old Man" accept one time when he called him something else, like he fucked up and I wasn't supposed ta hear it.
EUNICE: What was it?
JIMMY: He called him.the Roman.
GREENLY: ( re: Jimmy ) Did this little motherfucker.?
EUNICE: Easy, David. I'm fine. C'mon gents, we're leaving. This is the Fed's problem, now.

EUNICE: You got him in custody. Ask him yourself. You're the professional.
DOLLY: Yeah, professional moron.
DUFFY: I got no idea. That's just weird. The Roman? What do you think it means?
EUNICE: Feels like our ghost ta me.
DOLLY: What do we do now? I mean, the brothers ain't goin' nowhere until we get Panza or they do.
