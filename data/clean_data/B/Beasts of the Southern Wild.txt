FINAL DRAFT: Based on the stage play "Juicy and Delicious" by Lucy Alibar
WINK: Get your pants on, man! Wink kills a beer and sends it out the hole in the wall into a basketball hoop attached to a fishing net that stretched 15 feet down to the ground. The net is overflowing with beer EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY Hushpuppy obediently climbs a series of increasingly bigger and bigger oil drums that function like a ladder, up to the door of her house.
WINK: Feed up time! Feed up! Hushpuppy, now wearing pants and a slightly more proper T- shirt, comes running down the oil barrels to her house. She echoes her Daddy.
HUSHPUPPY: Feed up time! Feed up!
WINK: Share with the dogs. Hushpuppy rips off a piece of chicken and flings it to a filthy chihuahua with no hair on the back half of its body. This is WINDELL, in spite of her circumstances, quite a handsome young pup.
WINK: Ain't that ugly over there? He takes a long pull on his beer.
WOMAN'S VOICE: A fearsome, uncompromising leader, sexy like a lady bullfighter, peeks at Hushpuppy over a mass of squirming crawfish. This is MISS BATHSHEBA ( 36 ). She points to three students, pushing their heads with her finger, each time announcing:
MISS BATHSHEBA: MEAT. MEAT. MEAT. The twelve students follow her through a maze of creatures caged in mason jars, basins, and boxes with breathing holes- her educational tools.
HUSHPUPPY: Daddy? Feed-up time. Feed-up? Hushpuppy bangs on the door of the shacko.
HUSHPUPPY: Like some sort of animal call, she SHRIEKS.
DADDY!?: Like some sort of animal call, she SHRIEKS.
HUSHPUPPY: Daddy? Daddy? No response.
MISS BATHSHEBA: You need a ride, boo?
HUSHPUPPY: My Daddy's coming to pick me up.
MISS BATHSHEBA: How about food or something, you Hushpuppy shakes her head `no'. Miss Bathsheba's doesn't totally believe her, but she's not the type to coddle either.
MARIETTA'S VOICE: Hi my sweet baby.
HUSHPUPPY: Hi momma. MARIETTA, Hushpuppy's imaginary, invisible mamma, is speaking from the basketball jersey chair. Marietta functions like an imaginary friend- Hushpuppy is the only one who can see her. Hushpuppy takes the pot, puts it on the stove.
MARIETTA'S VOICE: Hushpuppy what you doing there? You being good like I taught you?
HUSHPUPPY: Yes, mamma. Hushpuppy turns on the gas. Hushpuppy goes through her safety precautions: oven mitts, a helmet, she flips the table and hides behind it. She aims the stove lighter: a flame thrower made from a cigarette lighter and a can of spray deodorant. A spray of flames ignites the stove in a FIREBALL.
MARIETTA'S VOICE: You're good, you make me happy / you're good, you make me happy.
HUSHPUPPY: That's pretty Mamma.
MARIETTA'S VOICE: You're pretty Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy stares into the floating islands of cat food frying in fat, which in her POV is a surreal churning vision, like the bubbling lava at the center of the earth. She's SHOCKED out of her vision by a YOWLING CAT being flung across the yard.
HUSHPUPPY: Daddy! Daddy, Daddy! Wink doesn't turn to acknowledge her as he trudges across the field toward his Shacko. He's wearing a hospital patient's smock and no shoes, it seems he checked himself out.
WINK: Leave me alone, Man. She sees his hospital I.D bracelet still on.
HUSHPUPPY: You wearing a bracelet too?
WINK: Go in your house, you wouldn't I wanna come in your house.
HUSHPUPPY: I wanna come in your house.
WINK: GO AHEAD! Hushpuppy tears off. Wink storms into the Shacko in the Backo.
GO AHEAD!: Hushpuppy tears off. Wink storms into the Shacko in the Backo.
WINK: BOSS LADY? Hushpuppy and makes a runs for it, flying out the door.
BOSS LADY?: Hushpuppy and makes a runs for it, flying out the door.
HUSHPUPPY: I'm tearing off!
WINK: You ain't tearing off nothin', I'll bust your ass!
HUSHPUPPY: I'm tearing off just like my Momma.
WINK: Come on! Wink tried to yank her toward home and Hushpuppy refuses. She digs her heels in.
HUSHPUPPY: I hope you do die! And after you die, I come to your grave and eat birthday cake all by myself! Hushpuppy punches Wink in the heart and suddenly EVERYTHING GOES QUIET, as if all the insects in the forest have hushed. All at once, we hear A HUMAN HEART, beating until there is a SONIC BOOM, an earsplitting CRACK of glacial ice. Hushpuppy turns toward the sound. When she turns back Wink's face has transformed, wrenches with fear and pain. Wink keels over clutching his arm. Hushpuppy stares, her breath accelerating. Wink's eyes roll back in his head, he begins to seizure.
HUSHPUPPY: Momma!? Momma!? MOMMA!? I think I broke something.
HUSHPUPPY: Miss Bathsheba! Miss Bathsheba! My Daddy fell down! Miss Bathsheba takes Hushpuppy's hands as she tries to catch her breath to speak. Clutched in her hand is the hospital bracelet that Wink had been wearing. Bathsheba turns over the diagnostic bracelet and reads it, her eyes widen in recognition and alarm.
MISS BATHSHEBA: It's gonna be OK baby. Bathsheba hands Hushpuppy the medicine jar.
BOY: The storm's coming! The storm's EXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY Hushpuppy sulks out of the woods, feeling sorry for herself. She looks up and freezes like she's seen a ghost. Wink hobbles down the road, looking shell-shocked. The traffic on the road moves in one direction: out. Wink walks back into town in the opposite direction. In Hushpuppy's POV Wink arrives at Lady Jo's bar where a band of drunken sweethearts are in their regular positions. They are watching the evacuation go by like it's a Veteran's Day parade. They giggle and hurl good-natured curses out to a family making their way to safety.
LITTLE JO: Look at these assholes running around all over the damn place. C'est la vie assholes!
WINK: I know y'all with me. Y'all doin' the storm.
LITTLE JO: Lady Jo's ain't never closed honey.
WINK: That's what I'm talking about. Walrus my big man, you staying?
WALRUS: Wrong number buddy. I'm outta here as soon as I finish my beer. Wink dismisses him with a wave of his hand.
WINK: You ain't goin nowhere.
WALRUS: This ain't no sneeze comin' out the gulf. I'm gone brother.
WINK: I'll see you tomorrow Walrus. Lookit there, Winston's with me. WINSTON is passed out on the stairs.
WALRUS: Hey! It's Hushpuppy.
EVERYBODY: Hushpuppy! Hushpuppy's here. They burst into a round of drunken applause.
WINK: Hushpuppy? Where you been?
HUSHPUPPY: What happened to y-
WINK: He lifts her up by the britches and carries her away.
WINK: This side is still Wink's house. No toys, and no girl stuff over Wink pushes charred toys from Hushpuppy's house across the So if I want to come over that side and smack you in the face, that's against the rules. So there's a plus for you.
AHHHHHH!!!: A THUNDER CLAP shakes the house so hard a ceiling beam CRASHES down. Hushpuppy runs to her bed as if it might keep her safe. Windell, swinging from a basket tied to the ceiling, BARKS, panicking herself.
HUSHPUPPY: Mamma!? MAMMA!?
WINK: Yo Winston? No one answers. They push off.
WINK: Some day when I'm gone, you gonna be the last man in the bathtub. You have to learn how to feed your Wink goes to the edge of the turck and sticks his hand in the Now, stick your left hand in this water, stick it in there. Hushpuppy puts her right hand in the water.
HUSHPUPPY: I gotcha! Wink slams the fish down on the floor of the Turck and pins Yea! Hold him down! Now, you hold it down like this, and whack him good with your fist. Wink pins the fish and punches it in the face.
WINK: Yea! Hold him down! Now, you hold it down like this, and whack him good with your fist. Wink pins the fish and punches it in the face.
HUSHPUPPY: She hides her cut hand from Wink.
OW!: She hides her cut hand from Wink.
WINK: You OK? That's all a part of it.
HUSHPUPPY: Wink's hacking cough, which has gotten worse since last we heard it, fills the room. Hushpuppy tries to shake him Hushpuppy looks through the gap in his shirt. On Wink's chest, surrounding his heart, a corroded spider web of purple bruises shows through the skin, like varicose veins covering his entire heart. Hushpuppy's eyes go wide with horror.
HUSHPUPPY: Mamma? Is that you? The beacon does not respond.
WALRUS: Holy bowlegged Sarah!
WINK: Hey partner! Hey Walrus! Wink pulls in the Turck and paddles to rescue the thrashing They leverage Walrus aboard and lay him out on deck.
WALRUS: ( gauging his surroundings ) I musta passed out. Wink starts chuckling silently. His chuckle builds to a INT. LADY JO'S BAR - FLOODED - DAY They enter the bar, empty bottles, half eaten crabs, and general party debris are littered everywhere.
WINK: Little Jo! She awakes with a start and bangs her head on the table.
LITTLE JO: Wink and Walrus run to help her up.
WALRUS: Sorry Peter T. Peter T enters from the Bathroom.
WINK: Peter T, my man! I knew you wasn't gonna leave me man! Peter T speaks in his polite, level-headed, soft sweet voice.
PETER T: Oh no, oh no.
WALRUS: ( re: Peter T ) That is one classic dude right Peter T, you are a titan! Glad you stayed man! RHHAAAA!
WINK: Peter T, you are a titan! Glad you stayed man! RHHAAAA!
WALRUS: If I had wings, I know I could have flown in that bad boy. But I would have probably bounced off a tree, Hushpuppy lays on the table in pile of empty crab shells.
WINK: Hushpuppy! Did I ever tell you the story of your conception? The bar crowd chuckles.
WINK: .and Hushpuppy popped into the universe maybe four minutes later. He empties the glass, sufficiently drunk now.
HUSHPUPPY: Miss Bathsheba!?
WINK: Come on lets go! Time to eat! Come on children, feed up time! He sends a feast sliding across the floor under the table, where Joy, T-Lou, and Lizard dig in. Wink has decorated the bar with all the waterlogged relics of the Bathtub.
JEAN BATTISTE: To the last of the food!
WALRUS: To the last of the water!
LITTLE JO: You ain't drinkin' no water. Miss Bathsheba pour shots and toasts.
MISS BATHSHEBA: Yea, tastes like more, alright! Hushpuppy struggles to peel her shrimps, sitting on top of the table.
WALRUS: When the water goes down, I'm gonna French kiss the dirt!
MISS BATHSHEBA: Water's not goin' down man.
WINK: Nah, that's my beautiful place under there.
MISS BATHSHEBA: Man you know they got plenty of salt coming into that water, everything beautiful is gone. Trees are gonna dies first, then the animals, then the fish.
WINK: I got it under control.
JEAN BATTISTE: Come on Hushpuppy, come over here lemme show you how. Hushpuppy sits down next to Jean, a good pupil.
WINK: NO! Hushpuppy Wink POUNDS the table. And the party falls suddenly silent. Wink pushes the utensil away. He grabs a crab, opens it in three virtuosic hand motions. Grease and spice explode everywhere and Wink sucks the face of the crab clean. It is beautiful to watch. He slams a fresh crab in front of Hushpuppy.
MISS BATHSHEBA: You heard your Daddy. Beast it.
EVERYONE: ( CLAPPING ALONG )
CRACK!: Hushpuppy opens the crab claw and sucks down the meat. Everyone goes wild with applause! The kids too! Hushpuppy stands up, ascending to the top of the table. She lets loose a WARRIOR CRY and flexes her muscles, deadly Little Jo gets so excited she starts dancing on the table. She CACKLES and jitterbugs wildly. Walrus gets up to join her. Jean gets up and dances too. All the kids get up. Wink glows with pride. Miss Bathsheba smiles.
WINK: Yea! You see what kinda family we got?! We got feeling!
HUSHPUPPY: We got enough animals to eat until the water goes down. Rafts are lashed to the sides of the school. Every floating structure left in town is hauled in and added to the Ark. Peter T ties on a floating vegetable garden. In WIDE we see what looks like a small village of floating structures forming.
MISS BATHSHEBA: ( teaching a lesson ) Come here, like this. She takes Hushpuppy's hand and places it on Lizard's chest. She moves her hand in a circular motion.
WINK: ( to the water ) Come on fishes, where y'at? Wink empties his net- nothing but a pile of carcasses. He tips it back into the water. Wink pulls himself to the edge and sticks his head under to look for fish. Hushpuppy looks at him with an air of doubt for the first time. Wink looks ridiculous, a dead fish drifts off his You wanna leave the Bathtub, Wink pulls his head back up.
HUSHPUPPY: ( WHISPERING ) ( WITHOUT THOUGHT )
WALRUS: ( WITHOUT THOUGHT )
WINK: I heard that. Hushpuppy fidgets guiltily.
JEAN BATTISTE: Wink sneaks up and whispers to Hushpuppy.
WINK: Boss, Daddy's gotta take care of Hushpuppy is instantly concerned, she's heard this line before, and it always leads to trouble.
HUSHPUPPY: Everything gonna go right back?
WINK: Hell yeah, we gonna win. Wink pounds his chest in solidarity. Hushpuppy matches his pound, but without confidence.
WALRUS: ( an unconvincing lie ) I think they be gone. I-I really can't say where.
MISS BATHSHEBA: Walrus, don't make me slap your ass! They go to the levee!? Walrus is intimidated into silence.
WINK: ( WHISPERING )
PETER T: ( Soft and sweet ) Ok then.
WINK: Just don't pull `til I say.
PETER T: Ok then.
WINK: You can do it. I have complete faith in you.
PETER T: Jean Battiste is hesitant. Wink gives Jean Battiste a confident nod.
JEAN BATTISTE: Lock and load. Jean Battiste carefully unravels the string that leads to the fuse. He shoves the igniter down the mouth of the garfish.
WINK: Peter T hand me the- He looks, Peter T has both hands on the Turck.
PETER T: No I did not. Peter T thinks a moment.
JEAN BATTISTE: Oh, Peter T.
PETER T: I'm sorry. Wink dunks under water.
MISS BATHSHEBA: Here's how we do with wild animals.
WINK: AHH! Get off me woman! I'm trying to save the Bathtub Hushpuppy watches the struggle in hiding.
MISS BATHSHEBA: Get in the Boat! I'm hauling you're ass back home, little boy. Jean Battiste swims out of hiding.
JEAN BATTISTE: Jean Battiste, get the trip line! Suddenly, Hushpuppy pops out from under the nets, holding the rope taught. She stumbles and almost sets if off by She got it! Pull! Pull!
WINK: Jean Battiste, get the trip line! Suddenly, Hushpuppy pops out from under the nets, holding the rope taught. She stumbles and almost sets if off by She got it! Pull! Pull!
MISS BATHSHEBA: JEAN BATTISTE
JEAN BATTISTE: She got it! Pull! Pull!
WINK: NOW BOSS! No! Hushpuppy! Hushpuppy, contemplates in an eerie peace. The screaming chorus FADES and she is alone in her quiet, eyes darting between Bathsheba and Wink. Courage and certainly clench inside her her. You listen to your Daddy. She pulls the rope.
NOW BOSS!: MISS BATHSHEBA
MISS BATHSHEBA: No! Hushpuppy! Hushpuppy, contemplates in an eerie peace. The screaming chorus FADES and she is alone in her quiet, eyes darting between Bathsheba and Wink. Courage and certainly clench inside her her. You listen to your Daddy. She pulls the rope.
HUSHPUPPY: HUSHPUPPY ( CONT'D )
PILOT: This is a mandatory evacuation area, you can no longer live here. Everyone in this area, has to leave. I repeat..
WINK: Wink spews up an explosive cloud of medicine.
GUUAAAHH!: Wink spews up an explosive cloud of medicine.
HUSHPUPPY: Raging, Hushpuppy breaks everything she can get her hands on, ruining everything Wink's reassembled, tipping shelves, pans, walls. She grabs a fishing pole and starts bashing Wink's grill over and over.
WINK: You wanna throw things? Come on! I can do that too. You want to play that game? Let's throw stuff! Wink joins in, breaking stuff too, channeling all his anger into the destruction. Wink throws himself into the wall. It breaks off and dumps a series of shelves all over the floor.
HUSHPUPPY: Man. You think I don't know. Hushpuppy's bottom lip starts quivering. Wink's smiles disappears.
WINK: Hey. No crying. Don't you cry man. Don't you cry! He threatens her with a shoe. Hushpuppy hides behind an overturned chest.
HUSHPUPPY: You gonna be gone?
WINK: What? No!
HUSHPUPPY: You gonna leave me alone?
WINK: I ain't gon' leave nothing.
HUSHPUPPY: Cause if you be gone, I be gone Hushpuppy, that is not how it I will. Sometimes in the bed I start shaking and can't stop. I got what you got.
WINK: Hushpuppy, that is not how it I will. Sometimes in the bed I start shaking and can't stop. I got what you got.
HUSHPUPPY: I will. Sometimes in the bed I start shaking and can't stop. I got what you got.
WINK: No man. That's just a side effect of being a stupid little girl.
HUSHPUPPY: I ain't gonna be dead?
WINK: No. You? No! You gonna live a hundred years more. You know what, show me the guns. Hushpuppy shoves Wink.
TRIUMPHANT: Guns! Guns! Guns! Guns!...
HUSHPUPPY: Guns! Guns! Guns! Guns!...
WINK: ( OVERLAPPING )
HUSHPUPPY: I'm the man.
WINK: Who the man!?
HUSHPUPPY: I'm the man!
WINK: TELL ME LOUDER WHO THE MAN!!!! I'm THE MAN!!!!!!!
HUSHPUPPY: I'm THE MAN!!!!!!!
WINK: YOU THE MAN, RIGHT?! Wink is overcome with love. It's too much for him to bear.
HUSHPUPPY: You ain't the one who's sick.
WINK: You ain't the one who's sick.
WINK: We ain't going nowhere! Hushpuppy grabs a chair leg as well. It's a standoff.
LITTLE JO: You gonna have to shoot me cause I'm not going.
EVACUATOR 2: Ma'am we're not gonna shoot you.
LITTLE JO: I ain't never left here and I won't never will. She spits. They get closer.
EVACUATOR 2: Relax, relax ma'am.
LITTLE JO: YOU SON OF A BITCH! They drag Little Jo out of the house.
WINK: Get your hands off of her! I'm gonna kill you! Let her go!
WINK: Don't eat that. DR. MALONEY, a clean-cut, over-extended handsome young doctor hustles toward the lunch line.
DR. MALONEY: Mr. Doucet, can I have a word with you, we found something in your test. It's-
WINK: Whoa whoa whoa, not in front of my kid. Stay, Hushpuppy.
DR. MALONEY: Mr. Doucet, there's no easy way to say this. Hushpuppy struggles to hear more, only a couple words come through the din of refugees.
WINK: I don't need nothing from you! You keep your hands off her! I don't need nothing from y'all! Let me Hushpuppy is snatched as she fights to come to his rescue.
HUSHPUPPY: They tackle Wink to the ground. He goes limp as he falls.
BABYSITTER: Hushpuppy needs a hug.
HUSHPUPPY: I don't want your hug! The Babysitter squeezes Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy tries to squirm Hushpuppy, that's not how nice girls act. Say "I'm sorry ma'am." Hey! Say it. Say it or you're going to corner time. Hushpuppy's eyes meet Wink's and she freezes at his horrifying appearance. Wink grabs a sofa trying to stop the wheelchair as it rolls by. His fingers slips off, too weak to hold on. He tries to scream and nothing but a SEDATED MOAN comes out of his mouth. He tries to pull the tubes out of his arm.

ORDERLY: ( gently moving Wink's hand
AWAY ): There there, sir. Hushpuppy stares in shock as Wink is wheeled away.
HUSHPUPPY: They're coming for you.
WINK: Boss. Let's go.
HUSHPUPPY: Where we goin'?
JEAN BATTISTE: Go home! Everybody get up! Don't you want to go home? Lets go! These people don't care about you! Little Jo fights off an orderly with a syringe.
LITTLE JO: You live in this hell hole!
WINK: ( from outside the door ) Make sure you put her somewhere good ok? Wink sags. He's giving her away. He turns to leave..
HUSHPUPPY: ( banging on the door ) NO! I ain't running! No!
WINK: Why you trying to get rid of me?
HUSHPUPPY: Why you trying to get rid of me?
WINK: I ain't trying to get rid of you.
HUSHPUPPY: You is.
WINK: No. Hushpuppy. I can't take care of you no more.
HUSHPUPPY: Yes you can. Hushpuppy stares him down, accusing.
WINK: Daddy's dying! Hushpuppy's chest heaves up and down.
HUSHPUPPY: Don't be sayin' about dying.
WINK: Everybody's Daddy dies.
HUSHPUPPY: Not my Daddy.
WINK: Yes, your Daddy! Her defiance is broken and the information starts to sink in. It hurts Wink as much as it hurts her.
HUSHPUPPY: Come on! Come on! Little Jo hold Hushpuppy away from him.
WINK: Walrus, get me home.
HUSHPUPPY: Come on! Keep going! They try to kick toward the light but are getting nowhere, the current pulls them backwards. We hear a BOAT HORN and they look to where an ANCIENT TUG BOAT with a cabin that towers into the sky like a giraffe head, appears through the mist.
HUSHPUPPY: I'm going by my Mamma. He smiles broadly, as if this was the secret password. Him and Hushpuppy stare at each other and immediately there is understanding. Two lost souls in the wilderness.
SERGEANT MAJOR: That's a good place to go.
HUSHPUPPY: Which way are we going?
SERGEANT MAJOR: Don't matter baby, this boat'll take you exactly where you need to be. It's just that type of boat. Hushpuppy and Sergeant Major share an ease unlike anyone else we've seen Hushpuppy interacted with. The speak like an old teacher with his favorite disciple. They let their silences SERGEANT MAJOR ( CONT'D ) You want a chicken biscuit? Hushpuppy shakes her head `no'.
HUSHPUPPY: I wanna be cohesive.
SERGEANT MAJOR: Oh you will be, I got no doubt in my mind. They let this thought settle, then Hushpuppy turns her swivel chair back toward the water
GIRLS.": EXT./INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - ENTRANCE - EVENING Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard disembark onto the barge with Sergeant Major following behind. They circle around a hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it. Far-away JAZZ echoes up from the bowels of the ship. They look to each other in wonder.
MISS FRANKIE: Holy crap you have toddlers!
SERGEANT MAJOR: Good afternoon, Miss Frankie.
MISS FRANKIE: Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit! How you, Sergeant Major? You need some grits?
SERGEANT MAJOR: Yes ma'am.
MISS FRANKIE: Holy Sugar, they are so precious! Y'all just as cute as a tub of Women descend on the kids who recoil, not knowing what to do with all this affection. Joy Strong puts up her fists. Hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry of doting ladies. They are not who she is looking for. They are not who she is looking for. She scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up all over the ceiling, each of them with a bra hung on it, none of them right. Bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes, ladies smile and return to their drinks, drunk flirtatious dancers giggle at her, but she remains unfazed. She reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen. Hushpuppy stops. Sniffs. Heaven. SLOW MOTION: in Hushpuppy's POV, smoke curls through the swinging doors, the light illuminating the dust particles. It's a magic kitchen. Her POV tilts down to the floor where a pair of well-pedicured feet in flip-flops walks towards the swinging doors. They open. Hushpuppy holds her breath. A gorgeous COOK ( 35 ) wearing a baseball cap and an apron comes out the double doors. She wipes some sweat off her brow. She watches the band and kills a bottle of ice-cold The Cook looks down. Sees Hushpuppy.
COOK: You need something baby? Hushpuppy nods, holding her breath. She still can't speak.
COOK: Lemme tell you somethin', when you're a child people tell you that everything's gonna be all hunky- dory and all that bullshit, but I'm here to tell you that it's not. So get that out your head right now. She removes the knife from the gator and aims it at Hushpuppy like its a pointer.
COOK: The gator's magic. Hushpuppy looks up from her food-hypnosis.
HUSHPUPPY: You can take care of me. Me and After a long beat. The Cook shakes her head `no.'
COOK: I don't know nothing bout your Daddy, I can't take care of nobody but myself. This sinks into Hushpuppy.
HUSHPUPPY: This is my favorite thing.
COOK: I know. A far-away look has come over her. Her mind is somewhere HUSHPUPPY ( V.O. ) I can count all the time I've been INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY We look up at a face that's slowly coming into focus- it's Wink, younger and healthier.
WINK: Naw, that waits. Baby Hushpuppy's huge-eyed, warped facial expression ogles Wink. She coos.
HUSHPUPPY: I need to go home.
COOK: ( WHISPERED )
HUSHPUPPY: You're my friend, kind of.
WINK: ( BARELY AUDIBLE )
HUSHPUPPY: No crying. Hushpuppy's face hardens, and even as the tears fall, we see a strength and composure that only Wink could have put there. She falls into his arms and he embraces her. Hushpuppy squeezes Wink. She does not let go. She stays Wink's hand trembles on her back. She holds him as his deep, warm, heartbeat slows, slows, and stops. His weight slumps over her. She keeps on holding him, but she knows.
PETER T: As I stand by the bayou, Everyone else joins him.
EVERYONE: A ship at my side starts her motors and sails for the gulf. I watch her until she disappears. "There!
