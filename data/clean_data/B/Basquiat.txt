WAITRESS: What'll it be?
BASQUIAT: Ummm. It'll be great. We'll live together in peace. What's her name?
WAITRESS: Gina. What'll it be?
BASQUIAT: She leaves and whispers something to Gina. Gina turns and glances over at Jean. Jean pours more syrup and starts writing his name. At the grill, LESHKO, the burly Owner/Cook, has his watchful eye on Jean. He doesn't like what he sees. Jean smears the syrup thinly, so it doesn't erase itself. He draws a picture of Gina, using his fingers and the silverware, rendering her last expression strikingly with a few quick lines. A GAUNT YOUNG MAN saunters up to Jean's table. He's sort of a tall Puerto Rican Alain Delon with sleepy eyes. He is BENNY.
BENNY: Hey - Willie Mays.
BASQUIAT: Willie Mays.
RENE: Nurse!!! Oh!!! Nurse!!! Carrot juice. Tofu burger. Rapido!
GINA: We don't serve that - amigo.
RENE: Fine. A greasy cheeseburger. Fries - and a vodka.
BASQUIAT: ( under his breath ) Who's that?
BENNY: The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic - writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
BASQUIAT: Who am I?
BENNY: Oh yeah..
BASQUIAT: Oh yeah..
CUSTOMER: How's the special today?
GINA: It's your stomach.
BASQUIAT: She slows down, not wanting to.
GINA: It's me. I've never been done in maple syrup. Here's a rag.
BASQUIAT: ( gently )
LESHKO: Alright. Look at you, staring at this girl, making a mess. How about those pancakes?
BASQUIAT: How about those pancakes?
LESHKO: OK! Goodbye!
GINA: Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
LESHKO: You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
GINA: I just don't think you're being fair.
LESHKO: I need this?
GINA: I need this?
BENNY: ( waving g'bye to Jean ) Willie Mays.
LESHKO: ( to Gina ) That's right. You go with them. Make babies
BENNY: Catch you later.
GINA: What's a job, anyway? What's wrong with you?
BASQUIAT: I guess you did.
GINA: Guess I just got sick of him.
BASQUIAT: Can I walk you home?
GINA: I think I could do that alone.
BASQUIAT: Wait, I'm in a band..We're at the Mudd Club on Halloween. I'll put you on the I hate the Mudd Club.
GINA: I hate the Mudd Club.
BASQUIAT: I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
GINA: ( smelling ) You do! You definitely do.
BASQUIAT: Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
GINA: I don't go there. Too many party girls.
BASQUIAT: Party girls? Can I call you?
GINA: ( teasing him ) Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477-0496. Here, this is for you. I made this.
BASQUIAT: Here, this is for you. I made this.
GINA: She admires the speaker watches him walk off.
BASQUIAT: Hey, mom.
MATILDE: Do you like it here?
BASQUIAT: I'd like it better in Hawaii.
BASQUIAT: "She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
BENNY: Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
BASQUIAT: Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken!
BENNY: ( beat ) Your dad called again - something about a You got a date already?
BASQUIAT: ( exhaling ) We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist - she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with
BENNY: G'night. See you in court tomorrow.
BUM: The guy just hit me and I was on the ground!!!! Boom, for real.
VOICE: ( deadpan ) I-Is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline?
BASQUIAT: ( deadpan ) I-Is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline?
VOICE: Yes. My name is Chris. What's yours?
BASQUIAT: Jean Michel.
CHRIS: That's a beautiful name. French?
BASQUIAT: Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
CHRIS: What? Wait a minute. talk to me.
BASQUIAT: ( about to sob ) Life doesn't. make. sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that? ( pause ) What is it - did your girlfriend leave you?
CHRIS: What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that? What is it - did your girlfriend leave you?
BASQUIAT: No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
CHRIS: You see? You have someone to live for.
BASQUIAT: No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
CHRIS: What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
BASQUIAT: You don't even know me. I want real
RRRRKKKKKKK!!!: ANGLE ON CLOSE UP - A speaker. It fills the screen. We continue to hear:
ANGLE ON: CLOSE UP - A speaker. It fills the screen. We continue to hear:
BASQUIAT: ( breaking loose ) Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
BASQUIAT: Boom, for real.
GINA: I do. I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
BASQUIAT: Let's get out of here.
EXTREME CLOSEUP: A cockroach crawls from Gina's bedroom across the floor and into the kitchen where Jean sits naked on the floor, working on a drawing. It crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box. Jean rummages through a cabinet. He finds a can of bugspray. Jean tears off a side of the box. With cardboard in one hand and bugspray in the other, he forgets the cockroach. He's mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can. Someone POUNDS furiously at the door. Ignoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on the piece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including a symbol of a cockroach to the left of the list.
LANDLADY: Miss Cardinale. Open up for me, please!
BASQUIAT: Why didn't you say so? Damn! She's asleep!
GINA: ( to Jean ) What're you doing?
LANDLADY: Next Monday.
BASQUIAT: Wanna go get some breakfast?
GINA: A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
GREG: Jean, could you get me a Phillips A what?
BASQUIAT: A what?
GREG: A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
BASQUIAT: Jean searches through the toolbox. He picks up a screwdriver and reads the handle: "CRAFTSMAN"
GREG: Jean shakes his head and puts it back. He tries a couple more - they each say "CRAFTSMAN." He puts them back. Finally, he finds one with a different handle. It says "G.S.C.
BASQUIAT: You don't have any!!!
GREG: That's impossible. I've got, like, five of
RENE: I need to make a call, Mary. You don't mind, do you?
MARY BOONE: Certainly not. You can use my line.
RENE: To Paris. Bernard Picasso - You know Bernard -
MARY BOONE: ( wincing ) Be my guest.
GREG: Jean? Hold this, please. You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
BASQUIAT: I didn't know.
GREG: I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
MARY BOONE: ( to Milo ) I can't tell you how happy I am with this
BASQUIAT: ( to Milo ) My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
ALBERT MILO: ( amused ) No. Should I have?
BASQUIAT: I'm a painter, too.
ALBERT MILO: Really. Huh. Too bad.
MARY BOONE: Excuse me, would you please move those
YEARS": Jean and Benny amble onto a basketball court. Jean's changed his hairstyle. Now the dreadlocks stand straight up from his head. Benny dribbles with skill while Jean puffs furiously on a cigarette. He doesn't look like he's slept, but he's happy. Benny throws the ball to Jean. It bounces off a puddle and splashes Jean.
BENNY: Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. I am. On Gina. Fuck - I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
BASQUIAT: I am. On Gina. Fuck - I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
BENNY: Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
BENNY: You're shattering all my myths.
BASQUIAT: About what?
BENNY: Your people.
BASQUIAT: Oh - you mean black people!
BENNY: For a musician or a painter?
BASQUIAT: Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
BENNY: Ummm. Four years. Six to get rich.
BASQUIAT: Come on. I hate this. I'm no good at it.
BENNY: Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry - fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
BASQUIAT: Who's John Henry?
BENNY: Oh man! Folklore guy - worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.
BASQUIAT: So then what?
BENNY: He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you
BASQUIAT: Like I said - my liquid hijack Marlboros. Check it out.
BENNY: What're you doing? You're doing something.
BASQUIAT: He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
BENNY: Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
CLOSE ON: The driver's eyes.
MAITRE'D: ( to Jean, flustered ) Can I help you?.
BRUNO: ( sympathetically ) I think it's ok.
MAITRE'D: Of course, Mr. Bischofberger.
BASQUIAT: You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
ANDY WARHOL: Ignorant art?
BASQUIAT: Yeah. Like - stupid, ridiculous, crummy Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
ANDY WARHOL: Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
BASQUIAT: Ten bucks apiece.
ANDY WARHOL: I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
BASQUIAT: You don't even work on your stuff!
BRUNO: It doesn't matter how much you worked on
BASQUIAT: I can get ten.
ANDY WARHOL: I'll take two. This one and. that one. Can I borrow some money, Bruno?
BRUNO: Here. Do you have change?

BASQUIAT: Gina, don't you want any of this? You could use some.
GINA: See you later. Nice underwear.
GUY #1: Nice underwear.
GINA: Silence. She picks up the mail from under the door and walks into the room. There's a lump on the floor. It's Jean.
GINA: Jean, what did you do to yourself?
GINA: ( panicking ) Jesus Christ!
GINA: ( slapping his face ) Don't do this to me.
BASQUIAT: . What's the matter?
GINA: ( furious ) Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to You're back.
BASQUIAT: You're back.
GINA: It's Monday morning.

RENE: ARTIST #2

ARTIST #2: That's the same guy who did this painting.
RENE: I know that. Don't let him get away.
BINOCULARS POV: We watch as Rene looks frantically for Jean, but can't spot him. Finally he sees Jean's hair-do bobbing up and down a block away. He runs towards it.
RENE: Hey, wait up!!!
RENE: You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
BASQUIAT: Can you put me in the ring with him?

BASQUIAT: Think so?
GINA: You mean babies with you?
BASQUIAT: What's wrong with me?
GINA: You're your own baby.

ANNINA NOSEI: Is Jean Michel here?
GINA: Closed in the bathroom, Jean smiles while eavesdropping.
ANNINA NOSEI: I'm here to see some work.

BASQUIAT: What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
BENNY: ( inhaling ) I don't really have any problems.
BASQUIAT: Good. What do you have?
BENNY: What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
BASQUIAT: ( mortified ) 'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
BENNY: That's not how I meant it. For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.

RENE: Oh man! That's one looks famous already.
BASQUIAT: ( quietly ) ( to Rene ) I forgot about that.
RENE: Fuck band practice. If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts - you don't wanna be like Tony Tony Bennett. What do you mean?
BASQUIAT: Tony Bennett. What do you mean?
RENE: Singing on stage and painting in your spare
BASQUIAT: I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
RENE: My point exactly.
BASQUIAT: Yes, Boss. If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
RENE: You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
BASQUIAT: So what?
RENE: So shut up and keep painting..
BASQUIAT: ( touched ) What time is it?
RENE: Jean regards a near-finished painting. He writes "5:11" on it. He crosses it out and re-writes it, "Rene 5:11." Rene looks pleased.
BASQUIAT: That one's for you.
RENE: Thanks. I'll take it tonight.
BASQUIAT: I can't. After the show.
BLACK: INT. ANNINA'S BASEMENT - LATER Jean is bent over his work. He looks to see a pair of legs. They belong to Albert Milo.
BASQUIAT: Hey - it's the big A.M..
ALBERT MILO: Rene's been telling me about your work.
BASQUIAT: I don't know.
ALBERT MILO: When's your show?

ALBERT MILO: I haven't decided yet. Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.
RENE: How about now?
ALBERT MILO: See you at your opening. Thanks.
JEAN'S POV: We see Annina's legs coming down the stairs.
REVEAL: A man wearing a pin-striped suit and gold-rimmed glasses. The woman is wrapped in a cashmere shawl.
ANNINA NOSEI: This is Jean Michel Basquiat. You've seen the SAMO graffiti everywhere. That's his. This is the true voice of the
CYNTHIA KRUGER: We've seen the graffiti. I work on Wall Street. And I've heard wonderful things about the paintings. Everybody's talking about you.
BASQUIAT: He looks up at them, eating the banana.
ANNINA NOSEI: Here's a very good example of his recent work that's not spoken for yet. He's got to work in a basement. He's got so much energy that if he worked in a place with a window, he'd jump right through it. Most of these are reserved already. After this week, this work will not be available.
TOM KRUGER: ( to his wife ) . I don't know.. This one's nice, but I don't know if I could live with it. That green is so. institutional.
KID #1: ( enthusiastically ) Yo, man, you're a damn lucky nigger selling this shit!
BASQUIAT: You like it?
KID #1: Not bad. Yeah, I do.
CYNTHIA KRUGER: I'm fascinated by his choice of crossing out words that way.
ANNINA NOSEI: Yes, well, they are more meaningful in their absence, no?
KID #1: ( to Jean, joking ) What does it mean?
CYNTHIA KRUGER: I like this one, but that green.
BASQUIAT: Y'want me to make it a nice shit brown?
TOM KRUGER: Beg pardon?
BASQUIAT: Hi. This is Gina.
CYNTHIA KRUGER: They're something like Dubuffet's. That. childlike quality.
TOM KRUGER: I like this one. If it were just another Get a fucking decorator. If you buy one, you'll have to change your whole lives - maybe even sell your kids! These paintings aren't even done yet!!!
BASQUIAT: Get a fucking decorator. If you buy one, you'll have to change your whole lives - maybe even sell your kids! These paintings aren't even done yet!!!
BASQUIAT: I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple
COUNTERMAN: You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple

GINA: What's that?
BASQUIAT: What's that?
GINA: What's that?
BASQUIAT: A present I picked up for you.
GINA: It's beautiful. Thanks.
BASQUIAT: ( tenderly ) You look like an angel.
"BOOM #2: A CAT POURING TACKS ON ITS TONGUE" SOMEONE ( the big red-haired dealer we met earlier ) walks in front of us. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a crowd in a gallery. It is literally filled with people. Again - all this takes place in silence. We begin to HEAR Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is?" It colors the motion of the crowd.
JEAN'S POV: We MOVE down Prince St. and take a left on West Broadway. We approach a huge crowd. We get closer and closer until we are immersed in it. The crowd realizes Jean's amongst them. People start approaching him. Someone removes the headphones. The DIN of the crowd replaces the music. Amongst the normal crowd chatter, we hear friends' calling out:
MAN: ( wildly enthusiastic ) Jean, man!!! Let's make a record!
WOMAN: ( slyly, intimately ) You finally did it.
MAN #2: ( pointing to Jean, sneering ) He's so fulla shit.
BASQUIAT: Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
ANDY WARHOL: My jacket? Gee, great. Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!

ROCKETS: A gift! I was just trying to give you a
BASQUIAT: I gotta go.
RENE: ( edging his way in ) This guy wants a picture.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Of the painters, please.
BASQUIAT: He said 'of the painters!' Hey - Albert! Get in the picture!
ALBERT MILO: Hey, Jean, I'd like you to meet my wife..and my parents. Mom, Dad, this is Jean Michel Basquiat.
ESTHER MILO: ( frowning at her son ) Don't do that. ( beat ) Hello, Jean.
JACK MILO: Hi, John. Are your parents here?
BASQUIAT: ( inhaling ) My dad's here with his wife. My mom couldn't make it.
ESTHER MILO: ( waving it away ) No thanks.
BRUNO: ( to Jean ) I'd like to do a show with you. ( pointing to "Rene 5:11" painting ) I'm especially interested in that one. I'd like to buy it for myself.
BASQUIAT: I wasn't gonna sell this one.
BRUNO: You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
BASQUIAT: Sure, ok..
BRUNO: It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
ANDY WARHOL: Bye, Jean.
RENE: ( hissing ) You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother - when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
BASQUIAT: I'll make you another one.
RENE: Forget it.
BASQUIAT: Rene -
RENE: SHHHHHH. Later. "What is it about art, anyway.."
DRIVER: I really. admire you.
BASQUIAT: Me? Why?
DRIVER: You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, That's great.
BASQUIAT: That's great.
DRIVER: Would you check out my studio some time?
BASQUIAT: Sure. I'd be glad to.
DRIVER: Quickly, Jean gets out of the limo. He leaves the door open. The DRIVER watches as Jean talks to two DRUG DEALERS. Jean jumps back into the limo. The driver pulls away. In the rearview mirror, he sees Jean separate a bag from a bundle of ten. He rips it open and snorts directly from it. He lays his head back and takes a deep breath.
BASQUIAT: ( calm, relieved ) What's your name, man?
DRIVER: They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
BASQUIAT: Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
MAITRE'D: Good evening.
ANDY WARHOL: Hi, Jean.
BRUNO: Jean, everyone loved your show.
JACK MILO: Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
ANDY WARHOL: Saddle River's in New Jersey.
JACK MILO: Saddle River, New York!
ANDY WARHOL: It's in New Jersey.
JACK MILO: New York.
ANDY WARHOL: I think it's in New Jersey.
JACK MILO: It's in New York.
ANDY WARHOL: Oh, I didn't know that.
ALBERT MILO: ( to Francesco ) You finish it.

BASQUIAT: Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.

MR. CHOW: ( exhausted ) Some other time.
ANNINA NOSEI: ( to Jean ) It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your
BASQUIAT: Annina leaves. Jean leans back in his chair, taking in this splendid new world. He pulls out a joint, lights up, inhales with pleasure, closes his eyes and smiles.

INTERVIEWER: Yes. What do they. stand for?
BASQUIAT: They're just words.
INTERVIEWER: Yes, I understand - but where do you take them from?
BASQUIAT: Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words What are they?

INTERVIEWER: Hmmm. And 'Parasites.' You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
BASQUIAT: You mean like an ape?

INTERVIEWER: Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your We don't hang them at home, y'know - just in the streets..
BASQUIAT: We don't hang them at home, y'know - just in the streets..
INTERVIEWER: I see.. And. How do you respond to being called - - yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
BASQUIAT: ( smiles - hurt, stunned ) Who said that?
INTERVIEWER: Why, that's from Time Magazine.
BASQUIAT: No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
INTERVIEWER: Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
BASQUIAT: Are those the only two possibilities? You wanna French fry?
INTERVIEWER: OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
BASQUIAT: Should there be?
INTERVIEWER: Tell me about it. What are you angry about?
BASQUIAT: Mmmm. I don't know. I don't remember.
BASQUIAT: ( to COUNTERMAN ) Can I have some caviar, please?
COUNTERMAN: Yeah, it's the best one.
BASQUIAT: I'll take the whole tin.
COUNTERMAN: It's three thousand dollars!
BASQUIAT: I'll take it. Andy, gimme three thousand dollars. Just the caviar - I'll get the rest.
ANDY WARHOL: When I was little, my brother and I used to have two ducks as pets. We called them the Rodriguez Brothers.
BASQUIAT: I wish they'd quit writing this shit about That's good. At least they're interested.
ANDY WARHOL: That's good. At least they're interested.
BASQUIAT: Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors - anything with a SAMO tag on it. The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five Wow. Stop giving them away. I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons. You wanna do it with me?
ANDY WARHOL: Wow. Stop giving them away. I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons. You wanna do it with me?
BASQUIAT: Yeah - I'd do that. You could teach me.
ANDY WARHOL: Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent. My dog, Archie. I woke up with flea bites. Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well. Let's leave this town and go someplace.
BASQUIAT: ANDY WARHOL
ANDY WARHOL: My dog, Archie. I woke up with flea bites. Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well. Let's leave this town and go someplace.
BASQUIAT: Let's leave this town and go someplace.
ANDY WARHOL: Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
BASQUIAT: ANDY WARHOL
ANDY WARHOL: What's wrong?
BASQUIAT: That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Do you still love her?
ANDY WARHOL: Do you still love her?
BASQUIAT: Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about Well, have you asked her to come back?
ANDY WARHOL: Well, have you asked her to come back?
MAITRE'D: Mr. Basquiat - what a pleasure to see you Hey George, what's up?
BASQUIAT: Hey George, what's up?
GINA: So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
BASQUIAT: He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
GINA: Don't you think he's using you?
BASQUIAT: Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
GEORGE: Would you like to see the wine list?
BASQUIAT: Chateau Latour '64, please.
GINA: So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but - whatever. I'm really And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
BASQUIAT: How is he?
GINA: Pretty much the same.
BASQUIAT: Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole. Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're -
GINA: ( referring to an extra loud snicker from execs ) What's that about?
BASQUIAT: Forget it.
GINA: That is amazing. What year is it?
BASQUIAT: George hurries over.
GEORGE: I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
BASQUIAT: See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
GEORGE: I'm sorry?
BASQUIAT: Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
GEORGE: Very well.
BASQUIAT: Very well.
GEORGE: Very well.
BASQUIAT: ( continuing ) Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were -
GINA: I don't believe it, Jean - they're picking
YOUNG EXECUTIVE: Excuse me. On behalf of my friends I'd like to apologize. We're really sorry.
BASQUIAT: I wish you niggahs could get it togeth-
YOUNG EXECUTIVE: What's this for?
BASQUIAT: The tip. You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I What's his name?
GINA: You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I What's his name?
BASQUIAT: What's his name?
BASQUIAT: ( re: the paintings ) What do you think?
ALBERT MILO: I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads. I'd take some of them out. I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
BASQUIAT: It's always how you would do it. This is my You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
ALBERT MILO: You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
BASQUIAT: Why, so you could humiliate me?
ALBERT MILO: No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
ANGLE ON: The birds. We see the statue in the middle of the park, but we have no idea where we are until we see the Mays Dept. Store sign. The birds circle in flocks, never lighting on the trees.
ANDY WARHOL: A little more to the right, Frank. OK. Good. Now up. You got a little more?
BASQUIAT: What's with the wigs?
ANDY WARHOL: I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
BASQUIAT: You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig? Piss painting?
BASQUIAT: Piss painting?
ANDY WARHOL: I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
BASQUIAT: How come you're not peeing on them I don't like beer.
ANDY WARHOL: I don't like beer.
BASQUIAT: If you ever want me to shit on 'em, just ask. You could finger paint.
ANDY WARHOL: That was my favorite part!
BASQUIAT: We can do better. It needed more white. Jean, you make me feel worthless. You're so
ANDY WARHOL: Jean, you make me feel worthless. You're so
BASQUIAT: I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol?
ANDY WARHOL: Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
BASQUIAT: People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
BASQUIAT: When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
ANDY WARHOL: If you say so. You sleep until 5:00 p.m. You call at four in the morning. You never show up anywhere on time - if you show up. You're painting out everything I do!
BASQUIAT: That's better.
ANDY WARHOL: I can't even see what's good anymore.
BASQUIAT: After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what
ANDY WARHOL: That would be a pity because you're a real
FRANK: Here's the poster for the show.
INSERT: The screen is filled with the cover of the New York Times Magazine. Jean is featured on the cover, without his dreadlocks.

BLONDE: Andy's assistant, Frank, arrives with CHRISTINE, 25, a model.
BASQUIAT: Yo, Frank.
FRANK: This is really great. What a nice place.
BASQUIAT: I don't think so.
CHRISTINE: Would you sign one of those for me? YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
TOXIC: YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
RAMMELLZEE: Yo. You know why Rammellzee's here, don't I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble Boom? As in ordnance? Are your letters
TOXIC: I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble Boom? As in ordnance? Are your letters
RAMMELLZEE: I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble Boom? As in ordnance? Are your letters
BASQUIAT: Boom? As in ordnance? Are your letters
RAMMELLZEE: Boom? As in ordnance? Are your letters
TOXIC: ( to Ram, re: Jean ) Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
RAMMELLZEE: You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
TOXIC: That's ignorant.
BASQUIAT: That ain't ignorant - that's just stupid. Can I get you a bowl of gumbo?
RAMMELLZEE: This interrogation is not over!
WOMAN: Albert Milo? Ugh! He's just a pressmonger. That's all these people do.
WOMAN #2: You know, I love Jean's early work. It's really got something. But this collaboration with Andy - maybe they thought it was a joke. I mean - whose work is it? Jean's or Andy's?
RENE: His early work? He's only twenty-six!
BASQUIAT: Hey, Rene.
RENE: Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
ANGLE ON: Rene responds to something Andy's been telling him in a low
ANDY WARHOL: ( to Bruno ) What's a suede biscuit?
CHRISTINE: ( amused ) Hey, what's this? It says right here you're Andy's. "lapdog".
BASQUIAT: Here. Pull over.
ANGLE ON: THREE KIDS in the process of prying a door panel with crowbars. We see that they're removing one of Jean's SAMO pieces from a wall. We read:
BASQUIAT: What's up?
KID #1: Mind your own fuckin' business.
BASQUIAT: ( recognizing his work ) That's mine.
KID: That ain't yours, man. Some asshole named SAMO did this.
KID#3: He's dead. That's what I heard.
KID #2: He ain't dead yet. He's gonna kill himself. That's why all those art fags in Soho are paying more every time we bring one of these in.
KID #1: Stupid SAMO. Hardly any of this shit
KID #3: This one's damn nice. I say we hang onto it if he's almost dead.
BASQUIAT: There you go. Now it's worth more.
KID #2: What's he saying?
BASQUIAT: I'm SAMO. I'm SAMO.
KID #3: ( bending close ) He says he's SAMO.
KID #1: He wish.
THE SEA: It is flat, dead, gray. Ominous and waiting.
BASQUIAT: Paint it out.
SHENGE: Yeah. Maybe just his arms.
BASQUIAT: Yeah. Maybe just his arms.
SHENGE: It's Andy again.
BASQUIAT: Still not here.
SHENGE: - In this corner?
BASQUIAT: ( not looking )
SHENGE: You want me to put it here?
BASQUIAT: Use your fucking instinct. Don't try to make art. Just paint like a
SHENGE: It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
BASQUIAT: Why don't you try letting her in, Steve - I mean Shenge.
SHENGE: Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
BASQUIAT: Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
MARIA: ( showing him the clogs ) These reminded me of you, the clogs. I found them in Amsterdam.
BASQUIAT: You remember Ellen? What are you working on?
MARIA: You remember Ellen? What are you working on?
ELLEN: How much is something like that? Fifteen. Reasonable.
MARIA: Fifteen. Reasonable.
BASQUIAT: It's unfinished. How 'bout some blue in the corner?
SHENGE: Blue? Where?
BASQUIAT: What's wrong with you today? Don't look at me like that. It hurts my I love these.
MARIA: I love these.
ELLEN: God. I just can't even care anymore. Compare this to a mountain or a tree. Who're y'all trying to kid? That's what I think. I was just in the Himalayas, and like - OK - is this important? No. I mean, compared to the rain forest or something? These are just narcissistic jokes.
MARIA: ( to Jean ) Who are you selling these through now?
BASQUIAT: Well, that's better. You can buy direct from me.
ELLEN: Look at these - silkscreens? What're you? Andy Warhol Junior? It's like - not even handmade anymore.
MARY BOONE: Jean Michel. Crawling from the wreckage?
BASQUIAT: I need a dealer.
MARY BOONE: You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
ALBERT MILO: Hey Jean! It'll never fit.
MARY BOONE: It'll be ok.
ALBERT MILO: You better take a look. Why's your door so small? The ceilings are sixteen feet and your door's the size of a mouse hole!
MARY BOONE: Why are your paintings so big? Just go home. I'll get it in.
ALBERT MILO: ( to Jean ) You doing anything right now?
BASQUIAT: ALBERT MILO
ALBERT MILO: Let's get out of here.
BASQUIAT: See ya in an hour. So what do you think?
MARY BOONE: Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
BASQUIAT: I'm here.
MARY BOONE: OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three
ALBERT MILO: This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
BASQUIAT: Do you ever get sick of it?
ALBERT MILO: Of what?
BASQUIAT: The whole thing - painting.
ALBERT MILO: No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every
BASQUIAT: What about the shit they write?
ALBERT MILO: You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
BASQUIAT: I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
ALBERT MILO: As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
ALBERT MILO: Alright. I'll be right up.
STELLA: ( to Jean ) I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
BASQUIAT: I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
STELLA: I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
BASQUIAT: You like your dad's paintings?
STELLA: Some of them.
BASQUIAT: Stand still.
STELLA: He walks to the door, leaving the drawing on the floor. Albert returns.
ALBERT MILO: Where's Jean?
STELLA: He just left.
BASQUIAT: B.B. It's me - Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
BRUNO: I didn't see you.
BASQUIAT: What do you mean?
BRUNO: You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
ANGLE ON: The duck lying in the street.
BASQUIAT: Hello? Gina?
MALE VOICE: Who is it?
ANGLE UP: Gina and Benny look out the window into the street. Jean's a block away.
BASQUIAT: Hey, come here! Please. Just for a second. Open the door.
BASQUIAT: Open up! Open up!
GUARD: Come back tomorrow. Visiting hours are Don't cause any trouble.
BASQUIAT: I'm not here to visit. I wanna take her
GUARD: Don't cause any trouble.
STREET SOUNDS: BENNY ( O.S. )
BASQUIAT: Willie Mays. Nice to see you.
BENNY: She's good.
BASQUIAT: I guess it was a long time ago.
BENNY: Come on, let's get out of here.
BENNY: Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
BASQUIAT: Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
BENNY: Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
BASQUIAT: Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
CLERK: You starting a hospital?
BASQUIAT: Just ring it up. I don't need a bag. Try this tabouli - it's great.
