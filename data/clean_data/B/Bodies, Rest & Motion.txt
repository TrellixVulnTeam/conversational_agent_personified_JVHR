BETH: Just some friends.
NICK: You'll make new friends.
BETH: I know. I'm not eight years old. I know I'll make new friends.
NICK: Then what is it?
BETH: ( uncomfortably ) I, umm. I. It embarrasses me. When you talk about something with Carol that happened before me. She's my best friend. It embarrasses me that you used to live with her.
NICK: That was years ago.
BETH: Three years.

SID: ( not looking up ) The painter.
BETH: ( agitated ) What are you doing?
SID: The painter looks up from the drop-cloth, ready to deal with this obstacle. He freezes. His face lights up. It's Sid.

BETH: The new people move in on Sunday. Where are you moving to?
SID: The new people move in on Sunday. Where are you moving to?
BETH: ( wearily ) Billings, Montana.
SID: ( incredulous ) It can't be worse than Enfield,
BETH: It can't be worse than Enfield,
SID: ( smiling ) I've lived in Enfield my whole life.
SID: Could you hold this?
SID: I use this to mask. Have you ever used masking tape to mask?
BETH: No. I haven't.
SID: A house like this, it's real easy. Hardly needs a paint job.
BETH: You can skip it. I won't tell.
SID: It needs a fresh coat. .a little color.
SID: .a little color.
BETH: ( naturally curious ) What color is it gonna be?
SID: He goes along the floor pressing the masking tape to the
BETH: It's already off-white.
SID: No. It's white. It's just dirty.
SID: Now if it was my house, I would choose a color.

BETH: What would you choose?
SID: The color of your eyes.
CAROL: Sorry I'm late, the new girl's a What's that?

CAROL: I thought you might need it.
NICK: ( unfolding it ) I do! I had a map I lost it.
CAROL: ( organized ) Let's highlight your route.
A MAP: of the Western half of the U.S.A. fills the FRAME. Carol's hand, holding a bright red felt-tip pen, ENTERS FRAME.
NICK: ( emphatically ) Where I grew up. Where my parent's live. Isn't that a coincidence?
CAROL: Visit them.
NICK: ( shaking his head ) Oh. no.
CAROL: You're going to be driving by.
NICK: ( shaking his head ) They're not near the interstate. ( sort of chagrined ) I haven't even called them in years.
CAROL: You might as well visit.
NICK: ( adamantly ) ( shrugging ) I wouldn't know them.
NICK: Let me.
CAROL: Let me.
NICK: He leans over the table and kisses her. She stands.
CAROL: I'm starved.
SID: I'm lucky I don't have to kill them.
BETH: ( not a line she was expecting ) If they were dark, I'd have to put a layer of kill down first.
SID: If they were dark, I'd have to put a layer of kill down first.
SID: So the dark paint wouldn't shine through the off-white.
BETH: She picks up two empty liquor boxes.
SID: Kill's an oil based paint.
SID: It covers the old paint so that you'd never know it was there, but it gives off fumes when it's drying.
SID: Noxious fumes. They would find us on the floor unconscious.
BETH: Sid sits on the bed, checking it's firmness.
SID: The "they" that find people.
BETH: ( interjecting ) ( flatly ) ( after a beat ) The man I live with.
SID: ( flatly ) ( after a beat ) The man I live with.
BETH: ( flatly ) ( after a beat ) The man I live with.
SID: ( smiling ) I guess he'd be the "they".
BETH: He'd find us. And he'd be surprised.
NICK: ( doggedly ) It was the drive that killed us. San Antonio to Seattle is just too many hours in a car. If we'd have flown, we would've made it.
CAROL: ( shaking her head ) Things were all right in bed.
NICK: Things were all right in bed.
CAROL: But the rest of the time they were. Nick. We couldn't stand each other. We stopped in Enfield and just stayed.
NICK: ( hurt ) ( flatly ) Nick. We couldn't stand each other. We stopped in Enfield and just stayed.
CAROL: ( flatly ) Nick. We couldn't stand each other. We stopped in Enfield and just stayed.
NICK: ( after a beat ) Why didn't you go on to Seattle? It was your car.
CAROL: ( dryly ) Big trees scare me.
NICK: ( casually ) I'm thinking about stealing a t.v.
SID: ( cheerfully ) I'm done in there. I won't paint the ceiling 'til you've moved the furniture out.
BETH: I don't think we're going to take much of the furniture.
SID: It's ugly.
BETH: It's ugly.
SID: I kind of like the sofa.
BETH: It's a sofa bed.
SID: You're not going to take it?
BETH: ( flatly ) It weighs two thousand pounds.
SID: Can I have it?
BETH: It's yours.
SID: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS The furniture is kind of ugly, but the walls look great. The whole room seems brighter, almost magically more cheerful. Sid runs into the room and flops onto the sofa. He settles in and sighs contentedly. The front door BURSTS open. Sid leaps up. Carol races into the room.
CAROL: ( excited ) Nick's gonna steal a t.v.!
CAROL: Who are you?
SID: The painter.
BETH: ( excitedly ) He's really gonna do it?
CAROL: He says yes. We've got to talk.
CAROL: ( conspiratorilly ) We've got to talk.
SID: ( piping in ) About the crime?
CAROL: ( sharply ) There's no crime.
SID: Nick's gonna steal a t.v.
CAROL: That's just an expression.
SID: I've never heard that expression.
CAROL: ( witheringly ) It's making the rounds. College students use it.
SID: ( to Beth ) Where's he stealing it from?
BETH: ( incredulous ) You want him to know?
CAROL: ( incredulous ) You want him to know?
BETH: He knows. He doesn't care. Do you care?
SID: ( enthusiastically ) I'm interested. Crime's interesting. I read the papers.
BETH: It's not a crime.
CAROL: It's justice.
BETH: Poetic justice.
SID: They fired him.
BETH: They fired him.
SID: ( deducing ) He's got motive.
CAROL: ( exasperated ) Who is this guy?!
BETH: The painter.
SID: ( helpfully ) ( point blank ) ( purposefully ) He needs you at the store.
CAROL: ( point blank ) ( purposefully ) He needs you at the store.
CAROL: ( purposefully ) He needs you at the store.
BETH: ( tinged w/ apprehension ) He needs me?
NICK: You lookin' or buyin'?
RORY: Lookin'. I hate television.
NICK: Yeah. What do you like?
RORY: ( shaking his head ) I do.
NICK: ( shaking his head ) I do.
RORY: I do.
NICK: ( laying it out ) You see. you go to a movie, you're
NICK: You watch t.v., you're thirteen places at once. As many channels as you get, that's as many places as you are. You get cable? You're forty places at once. You get a satellite You're all over the world.
RORY: You're all over the world.
NICK: In the BACKGROUND, on the big screen t.v., the soap actress breaks the embrace and points a gun at the actor.
NICK: You're everywhere.
NICK: It's called freedom.
CAROL: ( w/ attitude ) This is what you do?
SID: I also mow lawns.
CAROL: Which is your career?
SID: Painting. I'm an inside person. Mowing grass is seasonal.
CAROL: ( dryly ) That is true.
SID: ( disarmingly ) You've got a nice tan.
CAROL: ( not disarmed ) I work on it.
SID: Do you want to get stoned?
CAROL: ( after a beat )
SID: This kind of painting for people I won't know it's boring. It's not very good. It's homegrown.
CAROL: But it'll get you fucked up.
SID: But it'll get you fucked up.
CAROL: takes a drag on the joint like an old pro.
NICK: Have you thought about American?
MAJOR JENKINS: I own an American set. I'm very I want Japanese.
NICK: I own an American set. I'm very I want Japanese.
MAJOR JENKINS: I want Japanese.
NICK: I'll tell you.
NICK: .the thing is, a hundred and fifty dollars gets you very little in the way of Japanese technology.
MAJOR JENKINS: They stop at the case. Nick points.
NICK: It would get you that t.v.
MAJOR JENKINS: It's for my parents.
NICK: Your parents?
MAJOR JENKINS: Yes. They live with me.
MAJOR JENKINS: .and they want Japanese.
MAJOR JENKINS: Is there a problem?
NICK: ( controlling the giggles ) No. I, uh, just never think of adults as having parents.
MAJOR JENKINS: ( flatly ) They do.
NICK: ( agreeably ) I know.
NICK: I'm an adult, I have parents.
NICK: Oh, Miss, I've got your receipt!
BETH: ( acting cheerful ) Oh. great!
NICK: This is all you need.
BETH: ( puzzled, but playing along ) ( personably ) Now you just take this receipt out, give it to the guys at the loading dock and they'll give you your brand new beautiful television set.
NICK: ( personably ) Now you just take this receipt out, give it to the guys at the loading dock and they'll give you your brand new beautiful television set.
BETH: ( thrown ) I get the t.v.?
NICK: ( cheerfully ) Out back. They'll help load it in your car and everything.
BETH: ( flatly ) I get the t.v.
NICK: Out back.
NICK: Think about American. They're mostly Japanese parts anyway.
BETH: Excuse me, I just.
NICK: ( interrupting, pleasantly ) Miss. I'm helping this customer here, perhaps you might. ( firmly, a salesman's put-off ) You might want to see someone else.
BETH: ( pointedly ) You can't help me?
NICK: ( after a beat, then w/ finality ) Not really.
SID: ( savoring the bubble plastic ) Maybe I should just leave it packed.
BETH: Maybe I should just leave it packed.
SID: C'mon! You stole it. You gotta see it! Hold the box.
SID: ( urgently )
SID: I thought I heard the police.
BETH: Ha ha ha. You're stoned!
SID: ( innocently ) You're being silly and you've got bunny eyes.
BETH: You're being silly and you've got bunny eyes.
SID: I'm a little stoned. not that Carol's really stoned.
BETH: ( after a beat ) Carol's really stoned.
SID: ( after a beat ) Carol's really stoned.
BETH: You got Carol stoned?
SID: Very stoned.
BETH: I didn't think she liked you.
SID: She doesn't. But she likes getting She does.
BETH: ( smiling ) She does.
SID: There's nothing like drugs to create a quick and shallow friendship.
SID: ( rubbing his hands ) Let's look at the loot.
SID: ( very impressed ) Jesus. you didn't fool around.
BETH: ( w/ mixed emotions ) This is the nicest thing I've ever
NEWSMAN'S VOICE: And in Canton, Ohio today, a man opened fire in a mall, killing nine and wounding seventeen others. Initial reports indicate the young man was a disgruntled employee.
NICK'S SEDAN: swerves into a vast mall parking lot.
CAROL'S POV: Through Nick and Beth's living room window, WE SEE Sid struggling under the weight of the t.v. as Beth laughingly gestures where she wants it.
BETH: It's a beautiful picture. Nice speakers!
SID: ( enthusiastically ) Nice speakers!
BETH: ( happily ) ( w/ happy disbelief ) Fuckin' Nick.
CAROL: ( over the din, dryly ) Hi, kids.
BETH: ( cheerfully ) Come see! ( impressed ) I should have had him steal me one, You can come over and watch.
CAROL: ( impressed ) I should have had him steal me one, You can come over and watch.
BETH: You can come over and watch.
SID: ( to Beth, quietly ) You're moving.
BETH: ( w/ a tinge of sadness ) Oh. Right. ( to Carol ) Forget it.
CAROL: Forget it.
CAROL: ( breaking the silence, pointedly ) How's the painting going?
SID: ( shaking his head ) Too many distractions. I'll be at it all night.
CAROL: You have bad work habits.
SID: Not when I'm actually working. I better get set up in the kitchen.
CAROL: It makes teevee seem very futuristic.
SID: ( at the kitchen door ) That's 'cause you're stoned.
CAROL: I'm hardly stoned.
CAROL: ( mitigating ) It was homegrown.
BETH: ( teasing ) Want some Visine?
CAROL: ( flatly ) ( calling out ) It gets the red out.
CAROL: ( dryly ) Thank you.
CAROL: Shit. Missed the eye, got the face.
BETH: Need help?
CAROL: Beth goes to her and takes the Visine.
BETH: ( holding Carol's arm ) Tilt your head back.
CAROL: Stop fidgeting.
BETH: Stop fidgeting.
CAROL: Got it.
BETH: Next eye.
CAROL: Wait a second.
CAROL: ( nodding to the kitchen, in a conspiratorial whisper ) He really wants to get in your pants.
BETH: ( smiling ) My pants are taken.
BETH: Why don't you go for him?
CAROL: He likes you. I wish Nick would get back and help with the packing.
BETH: I wish Nick would get back and help with the packing.
BETH: He's probably getting drunk with the That's what he's probably doing.
CAROL: ( pause, then w/ difficulty )
BETH: ( simply ) He's gone.
CAROL: ( badly shaken ) Where'd he call from?
BETH: ( badly shaken ) Where'd he call from?
CAROL: He said the highway.
BETH: I have to do something.
CAROL: I'll help.
BETH: I've got to be out of here Sunday. That's tomorrow.

NAVAJO TEEN: ( sincerely ) What does it mean?
NICK: ( sincerely ) What does it mean?
NAVAJO TEEN: High pressure field coming in should bring some nice weather.
NICK: No. The wind itself, you know what I mean, you're an Indian.
NAVAJO TEEN: ( correcting him ) I'm a Navajo.
NICK: Yeah, so you're in tune with this It's thirteen bucks.
NAVAJO TEEN: ( checking the pump ) It's thirteen bucks.
NICK: ( his train of thought broken ) Oh. right.
NICK: Here's a twenty.
NICK: So what does the wind mean? Like as an omen or something, you know a change is coming to the people. the spirit of freedom is walking the That kind of meaning.
NAVAJO TEEN: ( handing him money ) Fourteen, fifteen and five makes
NAVAJO TEEN: The wind is. It's the wind like I'm a Navajo.
NICK: That's it?
NICK: He gets in the car, his mood darkening, and pulls his door shut with a slam.
NICK: ( out the window ) It would be better if meant something.
CAROL: He said he needs to be alone again. Learn about himself. Make a fresh start in a new town.
CAROL: ( after a beat ) He's sorry.

PREACHER'S VOICE: ( covered by static ) "And he arose and came to his father, but when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and."
NICK: He stares at the map.
BETH: ( forcefully ) You've lived here your whole life?
SID: ( after a beat ) ( increduously ) You've never gone anywhere?
BETH: ( increduously ) You've never gone anywhere?
SID: Travelling has no allure for me.
BETH: Sid climbs down and sits on the counter, dropping the half- donut back into the donut box.
SID: Maybe through time.
BETH: ( smiling ) That's not offered.
SID: So I stay here.
BETH: ( the simple truth ) It's my home. I belong here.
SID: ( the simple truth ) It's my home. I belong here.
BETH: I'm serious.
SID: My father says if you stay in one place long enough your luck knows where to find you.
BETH: ( wryly ) Maybe that's my problem.
SID: ( carefully ) Maybe it is.
BETH: She takes a donut and fiddles with it.
BETH: You think your father knows the truth?
SID: He's a bartender. He's lived here his whole life.
BETH: Has his luck found him?
SID: Not yet. But it's probably very close.
SID: ( cautiously ) Are you all right?
BETH: ( apologetically ) Must be the paint fumes.

SID: But I won't. I have to find happiness in myself.
BETH: But I won't. I have to find happiness in myself.
SID: No. That's wrong. People tell you that, but it's wrong.
SID: I've lived with people who have that happiness from within. That happiness it's just them being pleased with themselves. It's not enough. It's a lonely thing.
BETH: You're showing how young you are.
SID: No. I'm not. I'm showing you a way. You know that. And you know me. And I know you.
BETH: I don't know you.
SID: You know.

SID: Is that what you know?
BETH: I know.
BETH: ( whispering ) I know you.
BETH: ( w/ fierce intensity ) I know you.
SID: That's right.

SID: I knew her. on playgrounds. in Sunday School. all those grades I knew her as she changed. But she was still the same person. All the times I knew her, she was still her. She can't get away from that.
SID: You stay in one place, and all those things that are you. are there. She didn't understand that if you leave, they're still there, in you but they stop being clear. You stop knowing who you are, and what you You've stayed here and you know who you are?

I'm always left with ( taking a deep breath ) It doesn't matter if I leave the guy or if the guy leaves me I'm left with nothing. I never do anything for myself. I never acquire anything. I mean Nick didn't take from me. He stole a t.v. and left it for me. He didn't take my things, he didn't take our things. he didn't even take his clothes! And I'll still leave this house with nothing!

BETH: Yeah. I guess I did.
CAROL: Beth sips her coffee, gazing out the kitchen window.
BETH'S POV: The backyard. In the light of day it's lost its magical quality. The grass needs cutting and is marred by brown patches. The swingset looks pathetically rusted and CLOSE-UP: BETH Her face clouds over.

BETH: They look at each other and start to laugh. Their laughter builds a release of the strain of the last two days.
SID'S POV: Beth is standing in the doorway, a weariness having settled over her. She steps into the room.
SID: I'm sorry about selling the sofa I didn't really need one. When my friends get drunk, they throw up and sleep on the floor.
BETH: I'm sorry about selling the sofa I didn't really need one. When my friends get drunk, they throw up and sleep on the floor.

SID: That's about the saddest thing there is. losing someone you love.
BETH: It's never happened to me.
SID: If you died, I couldn't stand life.

BETH: ( businesslike ) I've got to go now.
BETH: The new people'll be here.
SID: ( following ) Go to my house.
SID: While you find a place.
BETH: No. I gotta get out.

BETH: ( her heart breaking for him ) Oh, Sid. Forever? ( shaking her head ) You have to understand it's just It's not.
SID: It's not.
BETH: ( defiantly disbelieving ) It is. C'mon, these things you say. c'mon! What?! If I died you couldn't stand life? That's. that's.
SID: That's true.
BETH: Beth can't bear the risk of opening her soul to believe him and she can't bear to hear the outpouring of his soul without believing him. So she ends it.
BETH: ( after a beat, harshly ) You won't know when I die. You won't be there.
SID: ( following her, certain ) You'd want me there. If I wasn't there it wouldn't matter who was. You'd be alone.

BETH: I don't know.
BETH'S POV: Sid is framed in the doorway of her old home, waiting, trusting that she can't leave, that they are destined.
BETH: Her eyes well with tears. Her face sets with resolve.
REARVIEW MIRROR: Nick's face stares back at him. It's not a pretty sight.
NICK: Nick reaches into the back seat, fishes and comes up with his necktie. He slips the still-knotted necktie over his headdress and tightens it around his neck. Nick looks back to the road and suddenly swerves off an exit ramp. The CAMERA LINGERS on the Exit Sign "Enfield AZ.".
NICK: ( calling out ) ( bellowing )
SID: ( coldly ) She's not here.
NICK: ( desperately ) Where is she?
SID: She's gone.

NICK: ( at the top of his lungs ) This really bothers me!
SID: ( after a moment, with mock politeness ) Will you do me a favor?
NICK: ( spitting out the word ) Act normal.
SID: Act normal.
NICK: ( adamantly ) Listen! I don't want to be normal. I don't have to be, I don't! This is my house. You're in my house. And I'm tired of going to my house and finding strangers!
SID: It's not your house. You're gone. I'm painting
SID: for the new people whose house it's going to be. You're gone. They're not here yet. I'm here. I guess that makes this my house. May I look around?
NICK: ( politely ) May I look around?
SID: ( w/ a stony politeness ) Sure. Make yourself at home.
NICK: ( dismayed ) Nooo. she left the television.
SID: Too bad.
NICK: Too bad.
SID: ( pointedly ) She didn't seem to want it.
NICK: That's foolish. That t.v. is a remarkable thing.

CAROL: ( walking past him toward the house ) Beth's new boyfriend.
NICK: ( exploding ) ( stopping ) You heard me.
CAROL: ( stopping ) You heard me.
NICK: ( to Sid ) Is this true?!
SID: Not really.
NICK: ( to Carol ) Not really?
NICK: ( to Sid ) Not really?! What? ( w/ "say it ain't so" attitude ) Did you fuck her?
SID: I don't tell.
NICK: Jesus! The next day! That's the world, huh? They don't even wait a day anymore.
CAROL: ( stepping in the doorway ) You left her.
NICK: ( defensively ) I didn't fuck anyone.
CAROL: ( witheringly ) You didn't find anyone.
NICK: ( hurt ) No. I didn't leave her for another person, I left her for another place. ( pause ) Which I think is a little more I don't.
SID: I don't.
NICK: Well it's none of your fuckin' I think it is.
SID: ( threateningly ) I think it is.
NICK: Cause you fucked her? No! That gives you no business in my life.
SID: If you hadn't gone, I'd be done by now. I'd be home.
NICK: Be glad you have a home, asshole!
CAROL: Let it drop, Nick!
NICK: ( outraged ) He was nice to Beth when you treated her like shit.
CAROL: He was nice to Beth when you treated her like shit.
NICK: ( protesting weakly ) I came back.
CAROL: ( busting him ) Nick. This is me. You didn't come back for Beth's sake something just didn't work out like you had ( defensively ) You see you don't know everything about me I didn't really have any real plans!
NICK: ( defensively ) You see you don't know everything about me I didn't really have any real plans!
CAROL: He was sweet to her. They were sweet with each other.
CAROL: Beth looked young with him. They had a real connection.
NICK: ( after a beat, dryly ) And I brought them together?
NICK: It seems I'm blessed. in what I do. I do wrong, and it turns out right. that I've done right. So it really doesn't matter what I do.
NICK: Sid ignores him.
NICK: ( after a beat ) I said "hey!"
NICK: ( flamboyantly sarcastic ) I hope you're very happy together!
SID: She's gone.
NICK: ( glancing to Carol, pointedly ) She is, isn't she? ( to Sid ) If you two were such the happy couple why the fuck did she leave, Romeo?
SID: After three years with you, she wanted to be alone.
NICK: I was already gone! This is not about me and Beth, there is no me and Beth! This is about you! Why didn't you go with her?
SID: It wasn't offered.
NICK: ( advancing on him ) People aren't going to offer you anything! You have to take what you You can't take another person. They have to give themselves to you.
SID: You can't take another person. They have to give themselves to you.
NICK: ( in his face ) That's very wise, but not very true. ( relentlessly ) I sell televisions. People don't know what they want. You have to show them.
SID: I couldn't show her.
NICK: Go after her!
CAROL: Leave him alone!
NICK: No. He's not alone, he's with us. She's alone. She's out there alone. Just hoping she's closer to what she And what is that?
CAROL: ( sardonically ) And what is that?
NICK: ( exploding ) I don't know! How would I know?! What do I know?!
NICK: How would I know?! What do I know?!
NICK: ( w/ a sweeping gesture ) I know that what I want isn't there. ( pointing to his chest ) It isn't here. ( gesturing wildly ) It isn't inside! It isn't outside! ( spent ) It doesn't exist.
NICK: ( forcefully ) But you want her, and you aren't doing shit about it!
CAROL: There isn't anything he can do.
NICK: He can go after her. Go after her!
SID: I can't. She. My life is here.
NICK: What kind of man won't fuck up his life for the women he loves? Go find

CAROL: You were drunk.
NICK: Not at the house. At the house I was stone sober.
NICK: He was very tall. He was too tall to be my father. He was wearing a long overcoat, and I thought, "it's a trick, he's on my mother's shoulders".
