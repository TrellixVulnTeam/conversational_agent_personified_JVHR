FLOYD: Why not be prepared? The money comes from the Colonel, the talent comes from you, Jack. I've got a connection to the equipment and the mail order distribution, not to mention those kids I got out there who are hot-fuck-action to the max. This is the future. Video tape tells the truth.
JACK: I have a stable of actors and actresses. in theaters ( where films should be seen )

FLOYD: Wait a minute, Jack. I'm not a complicated man. a dollar and a cent in this business I'm not trying to hurt you. I'm trying to help you stay
JACK: We're repeating ourselves now, Floyd.
COLONEL: Jack, I think this is about cost and future
JACK: The future is as bright as we make it it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars that can be saved shooting on video tape if it looks like shit and sounds like shit,
FLOYD: I think you're one gin past this conversation

COLONEL: I think that there is a serious case to be made for the price and the gamble on the whole idea of a home video market Jack: Two, three years from now, everyone's gonna be able to walk into their local supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette
JACK: True film fans won't watch that shit. It doesn't look good and more importantly
COLONEL: It doesn't have to look good, Jack.
JACK: I haven't heard that.
FLOYD: It's true.
JACK: We've got ten minutes until the New Year and I don't want it to start like this so I'm leaving now. We will or we won't continue this conversation some other time.
