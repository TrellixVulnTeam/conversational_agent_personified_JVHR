CLOSE ON: The handsome face of Pierre Delacroix.
CHEEBA: Yo, let's get to it. You don't dance, we don't eat. Simple as that. The mass begins to move.
ANGLE ON: Entrance. Cheeba is putting the portable floor down on the sidewalk. Manray sits on the curb, taking the sneakers off and putting on his tap shoes; bottle caps are on the soles of the shoes instead of real taps.
CHEEBA: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I know everybody is in a hurry to work, ready to begin another day in this rat race. But don't sleep us. I'm Cheeba and I introduce to you the world renown MANRAY, the man with the educated feet. Manray takes a small bow. A few, not many, people have stopped to look.
CLOSE ON: Manray, who starts to do his thing, and when he starts doing his thing attention must be paid.
ANGLE ON: Crowd, as Manray gets busy, people gather to watch.
ANGLE ON: Delacroix, he is about to walk into the CNS building but stops to check out Manray.
CLOSE ON: Manray, he pounds out some intricate steps and freezes at the end of the move.
ANGLE ON: Crowd, who applaud as Cheeba unfolds a brown shopping bag and holds it out in front of them.
DELACROIX: Good morning, Cheeba.
CHEEBA: Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
DELACROIX: Y'know what I mean. Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
CHEEBA: Y'know what I mean. Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
DELACROIX: Not yet. Delacroix hands Cheeba a ten dollar bill.
CHEEBA: Delacroix moves towards the revolving doors of CNS.
DELACROIX: Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
MANRAY: Well do something about it.
DELACROIX: Good morning, Marie.
MARIE: It's not gonna be a good morning for you if you don't get into Dunwitty's staff meeting.
DELACROIX: What staff meeting?
MARIE: The staff meeting that started 30 minutes ago.
DUNWITTY: Monsieur Delacroix, this very important meeting commenced. Dunwitty looks at his Rolex Chronograph - Daytona Model.
DUNWITTY: I'm sorry I'm late.
DUNWITTY: Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
DELACROIX: I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until. Delacroix looks at his Jaeger-LeCoultre.
DUNWITTY: So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
DELACROIX: I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator. All eyes are on Delacroix and he feels it.
DUNWITTY: People, you can attempt to pull a Rodman like our friend Delacroix, but I guarantee you'll be sent packing just like him. Dunwitty via remote turns off the lights and turns on an overhead projector.
CLOSE ON: Ratings charts.
CLOSE ON: DUNWITTY ( CONT'D ) I do not like to be the laughing stock of the broadcast industry. I have pride and people, you better start getting some too. These numbers have to go up. Dunwitty turns on the lights. JOAN, one of the writers, raises her hand.
JOAN: So what do you want us to do?
DUNWITTY: What I want everyone to do is write some material that is FUNNY. The junk you've been writing is about as funny as a dead baby. It's not funny, it's not new. It's not sexy. It, it, it.
CLOSE ON: ANGLE ON Conference room.
FISH: ANGLE ON Conference room.
ANGLE ON: Conference room.
DUNWITTY: SUCKS. Thank you, Fish. This meeting is over but I want everyone to seriously think about what I said and how you can deliver. People scurry out.
SLOAN: How was it?
DELACROIX: Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
SLOAN: Nobody told me anything.
DELACROIX: What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
SLOAN: It wasn't my fault. If I would have known, I would have known.
ANGLE ON: Office. Dunwitty looks at the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking mid-town Manhattan.
DUNWITTY: Do you know what C.P. Time is?
DELACROIX: C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late. That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance. They both laugh.
DUNWITTY: Let's sit down over there.
DELACROIX: I understand. But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
DUNWITTY: Forget it. I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff. You're hip. You know what's happening. I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me. Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is headed with it.
DELACROIX: I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
DUNWITTY: NIGGER. NIGGER. NIGGER. NIGGER. Delacroix pounces on top of Dunwitty like a cat on a mouse and gives him a quick BROOKLYN BEAT DOWN.
DELACROIX: Say it again. C'mon, say it again.
CLOSE ON: Dunwitty. He's a bloody pulp.
CLOSE ON: He straightens his tie.
DUNWITTY: The material you've been creating is too white bread. White people with black faces. The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary. But that's dead. We can't go down that road I don't agree. The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or I'm telling you it's not. He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts throwing them one by one against the window.
DELACROIX: I don't agree. The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or I'm telling you it's not. He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts throwing them one by one against the window.
DUNWITTY: I'm telling you it's not. He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts throwing them one by one against the window.
DELACROIX: .to white? I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
DUNWITTY: Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
DELACROIX: I've never been given a fair shot.
DUNWITTY: You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways. Brother man, I'm blacker than you. I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
DELACROIX: I'm an oreo, a sell out? Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM
DUNWITTY: That's exactly what I think. I want you to create something that people want to see. Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans. You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles. This is a golden opportunity now. These idiots have to be led to the water.
DELACROIX: I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
DUNWITTY: You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you. I need a mid-season replacement and pronto. It will be on the fast track.
DELACROIX: What is it you want from me? Some plantation follies? Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch? Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads? You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
DUNWITTY: Yes! Yes! Yes! I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week. I want advertisers dying to buy on this show. I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
MANRAY: I'm starvin' like Marvin.
CHEEBA: My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
MANRAY: Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
CHEEBA: Did we get our bill yet? They both laugh.
MANRAY: I guess that will come with the rent, gas, and Con Ed bills, too.
CHEEBA: Ahh, the luxuries of life.
MANRAY: Yo, check it. This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
CHEEBA: Chill, I'm the brains behind this And I'm the feet.
MANRAY: And I'm the feet.
CHEEBA: Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation. Son, there is no such I'm tired of waiting.
MANRAY: I'm tired of waiting.

THEIR POV: The street is filled with police cars, vans and wagons. Helicopters hover overhead with their searchlights on the Cheeba and Manray jump into their cloths.
CHEEBA: Oh snap! It's a raid! Cheeba and Manray jump into their cloths.
POLICE CHIEF: Please evacuate this building. All of you are illegal residents of this condemned building. Please leave immediately, by order of the Mayor of New York City, Rudolph INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT Stairwell. It's bedlam. The hundreds of SQUATTERS who have been living here all making a bad dash trying to flee the NYPD as they "bumrush the show."
ANGLE ON: Floor. Cheeba and Manray try to push against the crowd.
CHEEBA: Not this way. Out through the fire The COPS are running up the staircase. People try to escape with as many of their belongings that they can hold.
MANRAY: My tap shoes.
DELACROIX: He jumps out of bed.
EUREKA!!: He jumps out of bed.
SLOAN: Oh my God!!! She too jumps out of bed.
ANGLE ON: Street. The Squatters are like ROACHES in a dark kitchen at night, scrambling as the lights turn on. Do you remember those old "RAID" commercials. "Let's scram, IT'S RAID!!!"
DELACROIX: How did you know?
SLOAN: How did you know?
DELACROIX: How did you know?
SLOAN: It hit me like a ton of bricks.
DELACROIX: How can this be? You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
SLOAN: The idea was out there in the universe. Now what?
ANGLE ON: Fence. They lay still as the Fuzz run past them.
MANRAY: We ran out without my shoes and the floor. I gotta get my stuff. What about our savings?
CHEEBA: Are you crazy? The joint is crawling with cops now. You wanna go to Rikers? Go to the hoosegow? Manray looks at his friend, he knows he is right, at least this time.
DELACROIX: Manray was under our nose the whole Do you know how you will use him?
SLOAN: Do you know how you will use him?
DELACROIX: Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
SLOAN: You lost me.
DELACROIX: Dunwitty wants a Coon show. And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air. Hence I'll prove my point.
SLOAN: What point is that?
DELACROIX: The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
SLOAN: Sounds risky to me.
DELACROIX: You getting cold feet?
SLOAN: I'm in till the end.
DELACROIX: Good. I'm going to need your Can't you just quit? Walk away?
SLOAN: Can't you just quit? Walk away?
DELACROIX: And lose out on my money? The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
CLOSE ON: DELACROIX ( V.O. ) ( CONT'D ) But there was a catch. A big catch.
CLOSE ON: DELACROIX ( V.O. ) ( CONT'D ) Manray and Cheeba were nowhere to be found.
ANGLE ON: Street. They run in the downpour.
CLOSE ON: DELACROIX ( V.O. ) ( CONT'D ) I had no contact numbers, no address, no beeper.
CLOSE ON: DELACROIX ( V.O. ) ( CONT'D ) No nuthin', no clues.
SLOAN: Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
DELACROIX: Manray better not be bleeding to death. I need him. After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
SLOAN: You're beginning to sound like EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - MORNING Manray and Cheeba stand across the street from their former residence. All of the doors and windows have been boarded up and two cops stand watch. They both look defeated, dirty and hungry.
CHEEBA: His name is Delapoint.
CHEEBA: Delapot. Dela-something.
MANRAY: Sloan! She knows us. The security guard stops.
SLOAN: It's alright. They are associates of Mr. Delacroix.
SLOAN: That won't be needed.
DELACROIX: Eureka! Where've you been? He hugs them both.
CHEEBA: You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
DELACROIX: No offense.
CHEEBA: Manray needs a job. Delacroix smiles at Sloan.
MANRAY: We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
CHEEBA: We was coming to see you.
MANRAY: If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
CHEEBA: We're starving.
DELACROIX: I apologize. What would you like to eat? Anything you want.
TIME CUT: INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - DAY A feast of McDonald's is taking place. Cheeba and Manray are stuffing Big Macs, Fish Deluxes and large french fries into their mouths. They were famished.
DELACROIX: I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
CHEEBA: How much?
DELACROIX: First things first. I have to know if Manray is up for this.
MANRAY: What do I have to do?
DELACROIX: Some tap dancing, some singing.
MANRAY: Where do I sign?
CHEEBA: What kind of show is this gonna be?
DELACROIX: How different?
MANRAY: How different?
DELACROIX: Trust me. Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
MANRAY: DeLa, I'm aboard. As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
DELACROIX: That's right. Money turns the wheel.
CHEEBA: What about in the mean time? Not the in between time?
DELACROIX: You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
MANRAY: I would like to change your name.
DELACROIX: I would like to change your name.
MANRAY: To what?
DELACROIX: You're now Mantan.
MANRAY: Mantan? I don't even care as long as I'm dancing. Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
MANRAY: I never had a really real pair You've never had any formal training, either?
SLOAN: You've never had any formal training, either?
MANRAY: Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
SLOAN: I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a You sing and dance?
MANRAY: You sing and dance?
SLOAN: A little. I just graduated from NYU film school. Cinema studies.
MANRAY: So what's up with you and DeLa?
SLOAN: What do you mean?
MANRAY: Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. No, we're not knocking boots. I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
SLOAN: No, we're not knocking boots. I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
MANRAY: I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with. You look beautiful like that.
SLOAN: If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
MANRAY: You're welcome. You shouldn't give up on performing.
SLOAN: Why do you say that? You've never seen me.
MANRAY: I think that would probably make you the happiest. When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
SLOAN: I envy you. That's the way I want to feel about my work.
ANGLE ON: Street. A huge black Chevy Suburban follows her, all the windows are tinted jet black, you cannot see it all into it. She notices the vehicle and starts to walk faster.
ANGLE ON: Corner. As Sloan tries to cross at the corner, the Suburban pulls up in front of her, blocking her path.

SLOAN: You idiot. You almost gave me a massive coronary.
BIG BLACK: I didn't mean to scare you like that.
SLOAN: Well you did.
BIG BLACK: Give me some?
SLOAN: I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street. You must be crazy, Whoa, hold up li'l sis'. I done told you 'bout that. Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name. My true name is.
BIG BLACK: Whoa, hold up li'l sis'. I done told you 'bout that. Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name. My true name is.
SLOAN: I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
BIG BLACK: BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last. He hugs her, she becomes lost in his huge arms and laughs.
BIG BLACK: Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
SLOAN: I order out mostly. So what do I owe this visit to?
BIG BLACK: My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
SLOAN: Hook you up? The Mau-Mau's? You must be smoking. Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
BIG BLACK: So now I see where you're coming from. Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
SLOAN: Who are you revolting against?
BIG BLACK: We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color. And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
SLOAN: BIG BLACK If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours. What's his name again?
BIG BLACK: If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours. What's his name again?
SLOAN: BIG BLACK Yeah, him.
BIG BLACK: Yeah, him.
SLOAN: What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
BIG BLACK: C'mon, why not? The Monkees had a show. Look at all that other junk that's on TV. We got underground cult following.
SLOAN: You don't have the demographics.
BIG BLACK: So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting? I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
SLOAN: That'swhatI'msayin'. I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
BIG BLACK: There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you. Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
SLOAN: If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative. You got your ways to affect change, I have mine. And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
BIG BLACK: My own sister throwin' me out. I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right. Don't bother letting me out.
SLOAN: That's mighty black of you. Big Black slams the door.
DUNWITTY: Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
DELACROIX: It's right and tight. Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
SLOAN: This is Cheeba.
DELACROIX: This is Cheeba.
CHEEBA: Nice to meet you.
DELACROIX: And this is Manray.
MANRAY: How do you do?
DUNWITTY: Good. I like the names. Very We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
DELACROIX: We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
DUNWITTY: I'm wid it.
DELACROIX: I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right. In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial. I have never really dug deep. Not anymore. As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way. Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder. If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
DUNWITTY: Go on. Good so far.
DELACROIX: I know you're familiar with minstrel shows. They came about at the turn of the 19th century. It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air. Carol Burnett? So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
DUNWITTY: So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
DELACROIX: So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
DUNWITTY: The name of the show?
DELACROIX: It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW
DUNWITTY: I'm lovin' it. You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my Dunwitty starts walking around his office, pumping his first.
DELACROIX: It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air. In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
DUNWITTY: Don't worry about that, that's my department. Now who do we cast? We need a star. Can Whoopi sing or I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
DELACROIX: I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
DUNWITTY: Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose? Which one is Mantan again?
MANTAN: That's me.
DELACROIX: And Cheeba is Sleep 'n' Eat.
CLOSE ON: Cheeba. A look of surprise is on his face. Complete, utter
DUNWITTY: That's a great handle.
DELACROIX: Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. Two real coons. I know we're way out there but it's satire.
DUNWITTY: I want you take it there. All the way to the edge and back. Sloan looks at Delacroix with concern.
DELACROIX: Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. The Dusky What are there character traits?
DUNWITTY: What are there character traits?
DELACROIX: Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
DUNWITTY: Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
DELACROIX: Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
DUNWITTY: And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical Yep, you guessed it.
DELACROIX: Yep, you guessed it.
DUNWITTY: This could be bigger than "Amos and Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air. Could stop us from ever getting on.
DELACROIX: Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air. Could stop us from ever getting on.
DUNWITTY: Let'em try. I will kill to make this happen. Delacroix looks at Sloan.
DELACROIX: Negroes would be in an uproar.
DUNWITTY: So what. We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that. No such thing as bad publicity. So what. Earlier you said singing and dancing.
DELACROIX: Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer. He has educated feet.
DUNWITTY: Who are the other characters?
DELACROIX: Do we have characters? How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima. Dunwitty is dying with laughter. He's the only one.
DUNWITTY: We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one. What's the setting?
DELACROIX: In the projects. Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
DUNWITTY: Ya first bad move. Projects been done. That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired. Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation. In Alabama.
DELACROIX: I don't know about that plantation What are you talkin' 'bout? It's the move. Stay wid me now. We're movin' fast. What does everybody else think about this?
DUNWITTY: What are you talkin' 'bout? It's the move. Stay wid me now. We're movin' fast. What does everybody else think about this?
SLOAN: We'd get a lot of mail. She laughs, it's a fake one at that.
CHEEBA: I've always wanted to be on I like you. Sleep 'n Eat. That's funny. Mantan, how do you feel about performing in black face?
DUNWITTY: I like you. Sleep 'n Eat. That's funny. Mantan, how do you feel about performing in black face?
MANTAN: As long as the hoofing is real, that I can do my thing, I can blacken up. Let me hit it, beats and rhythms, express myself.
DUNWITTY: Show me a little somethin' somethin'. Mantan starts to put on his new tap shoes.
MANTAN: I'm gonna give you just a taste. My tap shoes are brand new. I haven't trained 'em yet. He starts to work out.
CLOSE ON: Delacroix, as he watches his creation, it's not a happy face.
CLOSE ON: Mantan, he's bringing it home. With the final move, he leaps off the desk into the middle of the office, and FREEZES.
ANGLE ON: The office.
DUNWITTY: That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout! He's off the hiz-hook!
DELACROIX: We think so.
DUNWITTY: Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
CHEEBA: I play the straight man. I do some singing and dancing also. I also manage Mantan.
DUNWITTY: Oh you do so?
CHEEBA: I'm the man behind the man behind the man.
DUNWITTY: You da man.
CHEEBA: No, you da man.
DUNWITTY: I'm gonna run upstairs with this. If CNS doesn't want to do this, somebody else will have da balls to pull the trigger. I want to thank each and every one of you. This is great, Delacroix. I'll get back to you later today.
CHEEBA: Life is beginning to look up. It's all good in da neighborhood.
MANTAN: You might be right.
CHEEBA: Why are you smiling so? His smile is a mile wide.
MANTAN: I'm not smiling.
CHEEBA: Naw, not you. It can't be. That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
MANTAN: It's that bad, huh? It's all over my face.
CHEEBA: No shame in ya game. She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
MANTAN: Certified ladies' man, huh?
CHEEBA: She's also moorish.
MANTAN: What's that?
CHEEBA: Moorish. Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
MANTAN: Seconds and thirds, too.
CHEEBA: Sloan is all 'dat. I try her. I'm a tri-sexual.
MANTAN: You'd try anything. I got first dibs. You get ya own stuff.
CHEEBA: Naw, just jokin'. That's you. That's you.
DELACROIX: I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't You have to start getting into your At the risk of sounding ignorant. Cheeba turns quickly towards Manray.
MANRAY: You have to start getting into your At the risk of sounding ignorant. Cheeba turns quickly towards Manray.
DELACROIX: You have to start getting into your At the risk of sounding ignorant. Cheeba turns quickly towards Manray.
CHEEBA: At the risk of sounding ignorant. Cheeba turns quickly towards Manray.

CHEEBA: We might need some mo' money behind That can be done.
DELACROIX: That can be done.
MANRAY: INT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT THE MAU-MAU's in full effect, bob their heads to the funky track that blasts from the studio monitors.
DELACROIX: INT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT THE MAU-MAU's in full effect, bob their heads to the funky track that blasts from the studio monitors.
ANGLE ON: Studio. They pass around joints that look like they've been on steroids and 64 ounce JUGULARS of DA BOMB MALT LIQUOR - liquid crack, the preferred alcoholic beverage of GHETTO NEGROES. All the members of the MAU-MAU's are AFRICAN AMERICAN except one. There is one Caucasian member. He goes by the name 1/16th BLACK, the engineer tech-whiz kid computer geek.
BIG BLACK: How 'bout. Big Black takes a long, long drag on a joint, then he quickly empties a 64 oz. in one swing without missing a beat, without missing a head nod.
DOUBLE BLACK: That's da bomb.
MO BLACK: That's gonna give me some Gonna make me get my flow on.
JO BLACK: Gonna make me get my flow on.
BIG BLACK: We should call dis da BLACK album. Everyone starts high-fiving each other.
SMOOTH BLACK: Yo, check it out. We have never conformed to none of the white man's rules and regulations and later for that ole slave owner Webster. Therefore I respectfully submit BIG BLACK that we from now on, hence forth and whatnot spell BLACK: B-L-A-K, not B-L-A-C-K.
HARD BLACK: I feel dat.
BIG BLACK: B-L-A-K it is.
ORCHID: You must think I'm some kind of fool.
DELACROIX: It looks delicious.
ORCHID: You hear me talkin' to you. The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
DELACROIX: C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
ORCHID: I said no such thing. All I said is that something must be wrong. She sits down with him.
DELACROIX: Can't beat it with a hammer. Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being That's wonderful. Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your He talks between mouthfuls.
ORCHID: That's wonderful. Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your He talks between mouthfuls.
DELACROIX: It was. It is. But this is a different kind of show.
ORCHID: If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
DELACROIX: Mommy, please don't call me that.
ORCHID: Son, Peerless is your name. Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
DELACROIX: I know what's on my birth certificate. You heard from Daddy?
ORCHID: I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this? Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
DELACROIX: To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
ORCHID: Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
DELACROIX: Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or I will. And good luck with your show. I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard. You deserve it. Delacroix gets up from his seat and hugs his mother.
ORCHID: I will. And good luck with your show. I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard. You deserve it. Delacroix gets up from his seat and hugs his mother.
ANGLE ON: Table. Cheeba and Mantan are giddy. Sloan looks at Delacroix who is visibly not happy.
SLOAN: You okay?
DELACROIX: I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
CHEEBA: DeLa - what's the matter with you.
MANTAN: You ain't happy about the green People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
SLOAN: People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
MANTAN: Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a I'm happy for all of us. It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
DELACROIX: I'm happy for all of us. It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
MANTAN: Pressure? DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!! This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
DELACROIX: I didn't mean it to sound like that.
MANTAN: That's the way it came out. Let me ask you one question. Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
DELACROIX: Now I'm privileged?! Why? Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare? Because I didn't call home a cardboard box? No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too. Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
MANTAN: The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing. It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way. Delacroix gets up from the table and leaves.
CHEEBA: What's wrong with him?
MANTAN: Must be the pressure. Cheeba and Mantan laugh, give each other some dap. A highly attractive PUERTO RICAN female walks over to their table. This is JESSICA GRILLO.
JESSICA: Sorry I'm late. Cheeba and Mantan are in awe.
SLOAN: Hey, girl. This is my best friend, Jessica Grillo. I invited her down to celebrate with us.
CHEEBA: I'm Cheeba.
MANTAN: I'm Mantan. They both rise.
CHEEBA: Please, have a seat.
MANTAN: Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
CHEEBA: In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
SLOAN: Later for you.
JESSICA: She has a lot of friends
CHEEBA: A lot?
JESSICA: A lot?
MANTAN: A lot?
SLOAN: Sloan and Jessica laugh at the expense of these guys.
JESSICA: I propose a toast. She grabs an empty glass and pours herself some champagne.
SLOAN: Excuse me. Sloan gets up from the table and takes after Delacroix.
ANGLE ON: Steps. Sloan catches up with Delacroix at the rest room area.
CLOSE ON: Delacroix. He leans against the wall.
ANGLE ON: Bathroom door. Sloan comes out, grabs him inside.
SLOAN: What is your problem?
DELACROIX: My problem is MANTAN THE NEW
SLOAN: Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
DELACROIX: It was the principle. Dunwitty had to be enlightened. I was making a point. I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
SLOAN: Fuck da money. Why do through all this effort? Why? Are you looking for love from Dunwitty? For respect? Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you. So now what are you gonna do? Someone begins to pound on the bathroom door.
SLOAN: You're gonna have to hold it in because we're not finished yet. She returns her attention to Delacroix.
DELACROIX: Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
SLOAN: What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
DELACROIX: I wouldn't bet against it. My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
SLOAN: Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal. Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it. The banging starts again.
ANGLE ON: Ladies' bathroom. Sloan and Delacroix file past the strange looks of the manager and FIVE WOMEN waiting to use the bathroom as they rush in.
DELACROIX: I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this. This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy." Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right. It's un-American. I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
DUNWITTY: To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right. It's un-American. I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
DELACROIX: I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
DUNWITTY: I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
DELACROIX: You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
DUNWITTY: I just want you to meet him. Keep an open mind.
DELACROIX: Besides, what does he know about Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective. A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter? With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
DUNWITTY: Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective. A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter? With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
DELACROIX: What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
DUNWITTY: If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
DELACROIX: That's exactly my point. Has he even directed actors before in No!!! Just meet the guy. That's all I'm asking. Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director. You can have that.
DUNWITTY: No!!! Just meet the guy. That's all I'm asking. Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director. You can have that.
DELACROIX: In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
DUNWITTY: Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough. Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it? Do you want it that much. Delacroix stares at Dunwitty.
CLOSE ON: He surveys the room.
ANGLE ON: Conference room. Delacroix and Sloan sit down at the head of the long oval table.
DELACROIX: Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
SLOAN: I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being I would have preferred at least one other Negro writer. Any questions? MONA raises her hand.
DELACROIX: I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being I would have preferred at least one other Negro writer. Any questions? MONA raises her hand.
MONA: He, I'm Mona.
DELACROIX: Hi, Mona.
MONA: I perfectly understand where you're coming from. As a minority I can relate to your struggle also. But I think you should give us all a chance. We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
DELACROIX: Oh, is that what I'm doing? BETH jumps in.
BETH: I think because of our background we can bring a unique perspective to Mantan. SETH pipes in also.
SETH: A fresh pair of eyes. A new look, insight, new angle that hasn't been seen before.
DELACROIX: I've heard this somewhere before. David raises his hand.
DAVID: My name is David. I do think it would be better to have some African-American writers but for whatever reason they are not here. I don't know if they couldn't find any people with experience, they wouldn't work for the pay or refused to work for the show. I don't know and nobody in this room probably knows either. I'm looking at this as a unique opportunity. We all should. I'm a damn good writer and I'm ready to go to work. Everyone in the room applauds. Sloan looks at Delacroix.
FREEZE FRAME: DELACROIX ( V.O. ) This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in. Could Don King be near? Good thing Sloan had my back. She's my rock. This was going to be a whole lot of work.
MONA: I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
ANNA: That could be cool.
KIRK: What about something like "The Jeffersons?" I grew up in Idaho so that's how I got my understanding of black people. Through Sherman Helmsley, LOUISSEE!!!.
DAVID: "Good Times" was better. Kid Dy-no You pole are going to far back for me. I think we have to go after a hipper feel. Like the stuff Eddie Murphy used to do on "Saturday Night Live."
AARON: You pole are going to far back for me. I think we have to go after a hipper feel. Like the stuff Eddie Murphy used to do on "Saturday Night Live."
PETER: Or Martin. You go girl.
JEFF: What about the black exploitation films? No one has ever tried making that work on TV.
DAVID: And for reason. Have you ever seen "Scream Blacula, Scream?"
MONA: I think, and Delacroix will agree with me, the politics of this show have to be right. We should always be laughing with our characters, not at them.
CLOSE ON: Delacroix, as the writers continue to ramble on, he lets them jerk off.
AUDITION MONTAGE: WE SEE singers, magicians, dancers, acrobats, comedians, rappers. Some good, most are terrible. Many come out on stage dressed like mammies, Stepin' Fetchit, slaves, pimps, ho's, hustlers, and basketball players. It is a cavalcade of all the stereotypical roles one has seen.
ANGLE ON: Space. LULU, a spoken word artist, goes her rendition of
CLOSE ON: DELACROIX ( V.O. ) ( CONT'D ) Were people this desperate to get CLOSE ON Delacroix. He interrupts Lulu.
CLOSE ON: Delacroix. He interrupts Lulu.
LULU: But I had several more poems.
DELACROIX: That's good. We've seen enough. We'll get back to you. Lulu scurries off stage.
SLOAN: This is the group I was telling you Which one is your brother?
DELACROIX: Which one is your brother?
SLOAN: The big one.
CLOSE ON: Let's get started here.
RUTH: Let's get started here.
ANGLE ON: Big Black preens around on the stage.
STAGE: Big Black preens around on the stage.
BIG BLACK: The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
BIG BLACK: My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
BIG BLACK: We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding. The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists. We drop CLOSE ON Sloan, who's trying to disappear. If she sits any lower she'll be under her seat.
CLOSE ON: Sloan, who's trying to disappear. If she sits any lower she'll be under her seat.

DELACROIX: We're ready when you are.

JO BLACK: And he's Mo Black.

DELACROIX: Good. We're really blacked-oops, backed up, so shall we begin?
ON STAGE: BIG BLACK Microphone check. One. Two. One. Two. Yo, the name of this joint is BLAK IZ BLAK. Hit it.
BIG BLACK: Microphone check. One. Two. One. Two. Yo, the name of this joint is BLAK IZ BLAK. Hit it.
ON DELACROIX: A look of disbelief is on his face.
ON SLOAN: She's in shock, horrified.
DUNWITTY: Delacroix. This is the director I was telling you about. Jukka Laks.
JUKKA: So nice to meet you.
DELACROIX: Nice to meet you. If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
JUKKA: I just turned twenty.
DUNWITTY: I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
DELACROIX: Dunwitty, don't leave.
JUKKA: Helsinki, which is the capital of You know, Finlandia vodka? Yes?
DELACROIX: You know, Finlandia vodka? Yes?
JUKKA: You know, Finlandia vodka? Yes?
DELACROIX: Yes, I know. Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before? Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
JUKKA: What's a Negro.
DELACROIX: A fiasco. A disaster. A boondoggle. An abomination.
DELACROIX: Did you just ask me what's a Negro?
JUKKA: Ahhh!!! I never heard of that term before. I thought you were BLACK of African-American. No?
DELACROIX: Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were
JUKKA: Thank you for correcting my ignorance. I'm looking forward to working side by side with you. I feel we make a good team.
DELACROIX: How did you get this gig?
JUKKA: My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
DELACROIX: This is a TV show, not a music video.
JUKKA: Then will you teach me what I need to know. Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
DELACROIX: This is a travesty. A debacle.
SLOAN: You've said that already.
DELACROIX: I'm gonna slit my wrists. Cut my throat. For the love of Joseph.
DELACROIX: For the love of Joseph and Mary. Delacroix bolts out from his office.
DELACROIX: I will not be held responsible for these revisions. These changes are not the way I want to go. This is an outrage. This is a sham. A Calm down, please.
DUNWITTY: Calm down, please.
JUKKA: In Finland, when we get upset.
DELACROIX: I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
DUNWITTY: We just punched it up a bit. Made it funnier.
DELACROIX: Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address. Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
DUNWITTY: I seriously doubt that will ever happen. Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
DELACROIX: Just want to say good luck.
SLOAN: Break a leg. She gives Mantan a kiss on his cheek.
DELACROIX: Wait a minute. Hold up. They all laugh.
MANTAN: Naw. I'll take the zero.
DELACROIX: You feel good, not nervous?
MANTAN: I feel fine.
DELACROIX: Not nervous? Relaxed?
MANTAN: Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
DELACROIX: Fired up.
SLOAN: How you feelin'?
DELACROIX: The material is fine. Sloan cuts a look at this liar.
DELACROIX: We're trying to do something new here, some groundbreaking stuff.
SLOAN: Everything's gonna be alright. You and Mantan will be huge stars after You really think so?
DELACROIX: Your life will never be the same.
SLOAN: Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
SLOAN: We both lied to him.
DELACROIX: What do you want me to say?
SLOAN: Just don't lie to me.
ON AUDIENCE: It's very young and diverse. They are laughing at the comic stylings of Honeycutt.
DELACROIX: Good luck, Jukka. Do a good show.
JUKKA: Thank you very much. I always try my best.
DUNWITTY: I want you to meet my lovely wife Verna. Honey, this is Pierre Delacroix and Sloan Hopkins.
VERNA: Nice to meet you.
DELACROIX: Same here.
SLOAN: The pleasure is mine.
VERNA: My husband has been raving about the awesome work you've done. How did you ever think of something like this? It's absolutely brilliant. Pure genius.
DELACROIX: I guess it was divine inspiration.
VERNA: Hope to see you both after the taping. Congrats in advance.
TWO SHOT: Delacroix and Sloan.
SLOAN: Divine inspiration? She laughs.
DELACROIX: I was trying to be nice.
SLOAN: I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's. I should not have imposed them on you.
DELACROIX: C'mon. You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family. You gave your brother a shot. That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot. He got his.
ON MIRROR: Mantan looks, stares at his reflection.
ON FEET: They're stomping.
ON MIRROR: Mantan blacks up his face.
ON MIRROR: Sleep 'N Eat blacks up also.

ON STAGE: First Sleep 'N Eat then Mantan shuffles onto the stage.
MANTAN: This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
BOTH: We're two real COONS! The audience lets out nervous laughter. They don't know what to think.
MANTAN: We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem.
MANTAN: To come back to our roots.
MANTAN: No mo' "city slickers." Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
MANTAN: Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
MANTAN: Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows. Go to your windows and yell. Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents. I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes. Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's? I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
MANTAN: Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies. I'M
ON AUDIENCE: They're stunned. They can't believe what they've heard, what they've seen. What they've been witness to.
ON AUDIENCE: Slowly more black people begin to applaud. Slowly it sweeps up into the black people.
ON AUDIENCE: The applause changes into laughter. It is not nervous laughter we hear, but straight out RIOTOUS LAUGHTER.
ON STAGE: Mantan starts to move, he's coming back from the dead. He slowly gets up from his prostate position as he HEARS: A WAYBACK ALABAMA JIG played by the house band, THE PORCH MONKEYS, led by musical director Levi. Mantan is joined on stage by the other hoofers in the show: JUNGLE BUNNY, SNOWFLAKE, SAMBO, AUNT JEMIMA, RASTUS, NIGGER JIM, plus SLEEP 'N EAT. Each take turn as it evolves into an elaborate DANCE NUMBER. The hoofers and the band are also in black ON AUDIENCE They are rolling down the aisles.
ON AUDIENCE: They are rolling down the aisles.
ON DELACROIX: Delacroix looks like he has seen a ghost.
CLOSER: He buries his face in his hands.
ON PHONE: It rings and he picks it up.
DELACROIX: EXT. STREETS - NIGHT Dunwitty drives his Mercedes Benz CL 600 Coupe.
DUNWITTY: Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass. They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air. Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows. We're on in 3 weeks. Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
ON DUNWITTY: DUNWITTY ( CONT'D ) They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut ON DELACROIX This has to be a big mistake.
ON DELACROIX: This has to be a big mistake.
DELACROIX: This has to be a big mistake.
DELACROIX: Hold on a sec, I got a call.
DUNWITTY: I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news. I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
ORCHID: Peerless, your father called.
DELACROIX: I'll be right over.
MANTAN: So what's up with you?
SLOAN: What do you want to know?
MANTAN: The good stuff.
SLOAN: I'm an asthmatic. Been one all my life. Can't go anywhere without an What else?
MANTAN: What else?
SLOAN: Are you trying to rap to me?
ORCHID: He wants you to come and see him.
DELACROIX: He said that?
ORCHID: Yes he did.
DELACROIX: Where is he?
ORCHID: He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
DELACROIX: I can't go all the way down south.
ORCHID: Richmond is not all the way down I don't even know why you're still concerned over him. Daddy's not with you.
DELACROIX: I don't even know why you're still concerned over him. Daddy's not with you.
ORCHID: Regardless, he still is your father.
DELACROIX: It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
ORCHID: Even more reason to see him. He'll be overjoyed with your success.
DELACROIX: C'mon, Mommy. Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done. From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
ORCHID: Peerless, last time, go see your EXT. PARK - NIGHT Mantan and Sloan are sitting on a park bench, nothing is being said. He sits up and starts to do a dance for her. To her.
ON BENCH: Mantan is doing that "Mating" tap dance.
SLOAN: Are you trying to seduce me? He puts his index finger over his mouth - "Quiet."
DELACROIX: I figured this was a good time to get away. Just jump in my ride and go. I always did my best thinking when I was driving alone. I needed to think out clearly what I was going to do with this MANTAN - THE
P.O.V. DELACROIX: This must be a big night in here because the PATRONS are dressed to the nines. What's in style down here is a lot different from what's happening en Nueva York. Many of the men are dressed like PIMPS from 70's BLAXPLOITATION FILM, the ladies like HOOTCHIE MAMAS from "Luke" video.
ON JUNEBUG: He is a good-looking man, the only speckle of gray in his hair betrays his age. As he walks around the small stage doing his comedy stylings, he keeps a drink in one hand and sips it often.
ON DELACROIX: He looks around.
P.O.V. DELACROIX: It's dead in here. The room is nearly empty.
ON TABLE: A couple gets loud, arguing over something.
ON JUNEBUG: 'Cuse me. Please. Can you please show me some respect. I'm up here trying to make a living.
JUNEBUG: 'Cuse me. Please. Can you please show me some respect. I'm up here trying to make a living.
MAN: Mind yo' business.
JUNEBUG: Don't make me have to come over there and whoop you upside ya head. The sparse AUDIENCE laughs.
ON TABLE: Delacroix walks over to the fighting couple.
DELACROIX: Brother man, that's my father up there and I drove a long way to see him perform. Please take this fifty, go buy you and the young lady some drinks in the club. The guy looks him up and down.
MAN: That's yo' Daddy? Delacroix nods.
JUNEBUG: Don't bring your woman out if you can't keep her in deep check. If my woman ever did something crazy like that I'd put my size 12 dead up in her ass. This gets the biggest laugh of the night.
DELACROIX: I want to speak with you.
DELACROIX: It's me, Peerless.
JUNEBUG: Son. Good to seeya. Good to seeya.
DELACROIX: It's been a long time.
JUNEBUG: Pull up a chair. Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
DELACROIX: Pleased to meet you.
DOT: Glad to meet you, too. You are all your father talks about.
DELACROIX: Is that so?
JUNEBUG: Honey, pour me and my son a drink. They both sit down as drinks are poured.
DOT: I'll leave you two alone. She kisses Junebug on the forehead before leaving.
JUNEBUG: Good woman. I trained her right.
DELACROIX: Daddy, she's younger than me.
JUNEBUG: My game is still strong. No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic. He holds up his drink and kills it in one gulp.
DELACROIX: I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
JUNEBUG: I did. I'm not an alcoholic. I just like to drink.
DELACROIX: How did you end up here?
JUNEBUG: How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy? Delacroix takes a sip of his drink.
DELACROIX: That's what I'm askin'.
JUNEBUG: Because I had too much pride. Too much integrity. I wouldn't lick nobody's butt. Some material I refused to do.
DELACROIX: Daddy, it can't be just because of that. There had to be other factors. Junebug pours himself another stiff one.
JUNEBUG: That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
DELACROIX: Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
JUNEBUG: All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category. He downs another one. Junebug drinks like a fish.
DELACROIX: The same old, same old. Trying to get my stuff through.
JUNEBUG: Dem white boys giving you a hard Nuthin' I can't handle.
DELACROIX: Nuthin' I can't handle.
JUNEBUG: The truth is never let them seeya sweat. You do that, that's half the battle.
DELACROIX: Where do you go from here?
JUNEBUG: Three nights Charleston, South I didn't mean that, in life.
DELACROIX: I didn't mean that, in life.
JUNEBUG: In life? I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers? The question is what are you gonna do, INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT Delacroix and Dot are on either side of Junebug as they hold him up.
ON DOOR: Delacroix struggles to put the key in the door.
JUNEBUG: I'm not an alcoholic. I just like to drink.
DOT: We know that baby.
DELACROIX: Let's get him over to the bed.
JUNEBUG: Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you. You never gave me no trouble. They lay him down on the bed.
DELACROIX: I love you too, Daddy.
JUNEBUG: Always keep 'em laughing. Dot takes off his shoes. He's out like a light. Gone.
DELACROIX: How long has my father been like Not that often. He was excited to see you.
DOT: Not that often. He was excited to see you.
DELACROIX: So he drank himself into a stuper?
DOT: The drinking is for the pain. It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
DELACROIX: So what's up with you?
DOT: I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him. I quit my job and we've been together ever since. Delacroix pulls out his billfold and gives Dot five crisp new model hundred dollar bills.
DELACROIX: Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
DOT: Your father is proud of you.
DELACROIX: He never showed it.
DOT: He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you. Delacroix kisses his sleeping father of the forehead.
CLOSER: DELACROIX ( V.O. ) ( CONT'D ) And I thank him for that. However, it did me no good seeing him in that state. Daddy was a broken man. He had been a strong man, with conviction, integrity, principles and look where it had gotten him. I had to ask myself did I want to end up where he was?

REPORTER: Did you watch MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW last night?
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Yes I did and I can honestly say I feel it promotes racial healing.
DUNWITTY: I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings. Through the roof. But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead. I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
MYRNA: First, I would like to say I love the show. It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
DELACROIX: Why are you here?
MYRNA: Good question, straight to the point. I like your style. Because of the content of the show we can expect some spirited reactions.
DUNWITTY: Myrna is here to help us plan our The best defense is offense.
MYRNA: The best defense is offense.
DELACROIX: I thought it was the other way You get my point. I've mapped out some strategies to help bolster our Which is?
MYRNA: You get my point. I've mapped out some strategies to help bolster our Which is?
SLOAN: Which is?
MYRNA: That this is fun. Nice wholesome Goldfarb, run it down for them.
DUNWITTY: Goldfarb, run it down for them.
MYRNA: The Mantan Manifesto. Catchy ain't it? Number One. We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras. Two. Let the audience decide. Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four. Who determines what is black? Five. Mantan is a satire. Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
DUNWITTY: We all stick to this, it's smooth It sounds kinda simplistic to me.
SLOAN: It sounds kinda simplistic to me.
MYRNA: I've done my research.
DELACROIX: These are black folks we're talkin' about, not some lab mice in a cage.
MYRNA: Monsieur Delacroix, I got my PhD in African-American studies from Yale, so I do feel I'm qualified.
DUNWITTY: Let Myrna finish.
MYRNA: Thank you. And always smile.
DELACROIX: Yeah, show dem pearly whites. She ignores him.
MYRNA: Wear Kente cloth, invoke the name of Dr. Martin Luther King, use the word "community" often when talking about Mantan. And finally our biggest plus is you, Pierre Yes you!
DELACROIX: Yes you!
DUNWITTY: Yes you!
MYRNA: This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male. Voila. End of argument. It can't be racist because you're black.
DELACROIX: I'm not black. I'm a NEGRO!!!
SLOAN: So you have your small victory, now A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
DELACROIX: A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
DELACROIX: What is this?
SLOAN: A gift.
DELACROIX: For what?
SLOAN: No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it. Delacroix opens his gift. It is one of those old cast iron Black Collectibles. This one is called "THE JOLLY NIGGER BANK," a head of a Negro, big lips, big nose, wide eyes.
DELACROIX: The Jolly Nigger Bank.
SLOAN: This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
DELACROIX: I thought it was appropiate.
SLOAN: I thought it was appropiate.
DELACROIX: Is that good or bad?
SLOAN: It's all good. You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank. Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
DELACROIX: How so?
SLOAN: To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
GARY BYRD: Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it. You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad. No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.

GARY BYRD: No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
DELACROIX: Yes. And I say yes because who is to judge? Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not? Who? Who can play God?
GARY BYRD: But the line has to be drawn.
DELACROIX: Don't you people get it? We're in the 21st Century. Slavery was over four hundred years ago. All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over. Folks always crying, white man this, white man that. Let's all grow up.
GARY BYRD: Are you trying to excuse our Can I finish? Thank you. I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon.

MANTAN: No, before my time.
SLOAN: You don't read, do you?
MANTAN: Never read a book in my whole life.
SLOAN: Maybe you need to start.
MANTAN: Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
SLOAN: Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up. They had no choice. They were considered 3/5ths of a human being. Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
MANTAN: Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me? This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this. You down with Delacroix.

MANTAN: I slept too near where I fell out.
MANTAN: Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you? Using all dose ten dollar words?
MANTAN: Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
MANTAN: Dat's yo Uncle Ben. That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles How be dat?
MANTAN: I don't know who I am.
MANTAN: Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter. My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother. My father's wife also became the mother of a son. He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter. Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother.

It's for you, out of the deep bowels of my heart - I don't deserve this. You take it. Alec Baldwin is shocked. He grabs Delacroix in a bear hug and they both cry like babies.
WOODY HARRELSON: The winner for Best Sit-Com is.
DELACROIX: I had it all planned. To the T.

MANTAN: For what? He left. Not me.
SLOAN: You're sure this is a good idea.
MANTAN: My people love me. He kisses her, she doesn't resist.
SLOAN: I love you. After a long, deep kiss she gently pulls back.
MANTAN: Y'know what?
SLOAN: You look beautiful like that.
MANTAN: You look beautiful like that.
ON SLOAN: She knows her brother and his clan are up to no good as the house lights go black.
HONEYCUTT: Thank you so very much. Show me some love. He laughs.
ON STAGE: Mantan is a pro, he doesn't stop. In fact, this makes him dance harder and harder.
ON SLOAN: She leaves her seat and goes to stop her brother.
ON STAGE: Mantan is moving and grooving. The unrest in the audience has picked up.
ON AUDIENCE: They start to "boo." The tide has turned. Encouraged, the Mau-Mau's pick it up another notch.
ON MANTAN: He's human after all, and he does hear the boos. Don't let those athletes in the papers fool you. You hear the boos and nobody, nobody except Dennis Rodman likes to be booed. Mantan is getting rattled.
SLOAN: This doesn't change a thing. I will still love him. Big Black can't believe what he has just heard.

DELACROIX: Pull ya self together. Mantan is distraught.
MANTAN: You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?

MANTAN: I'm more comfortable around my Let's jump right into it. Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue. How do you see all of Yo, Tavis, check it out.

TAVIS SMILEY: Money and nothing else?
MANTAN: Money makes the world go round. It ain't no joke being poor. I know Y'knowwhatI'msayin'? I've lived on the street. I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
TAVIS SMILEY: Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
MANTAN: No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand. Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing. If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it. Or better yet write your own show. Do it better.
TAVIS SMILEY: Don't you feel that is a simplistic I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple. Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL. It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem. This is America. Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else. I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.

SLOAN: I don't want to hear it.
DELACROIX: How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
SLOAN: You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
DELACROIX: That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
SLOAN: He's just playing big brother.
DELACROIX: Oh, is he? You getting jiggy with Please don't go there.
SLOAN: Please don't go there.
DELACROIX: Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
SLOAN: I can't lie to him. If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
DELACROIX: Do you have to be so damn forthright?
SLOAN: DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
DELACROIX: That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light. This bucket of blood.
SLOAN: That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light. This bucket of blood.
DELACROIX: You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody. I know where I made my big mistake. I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
DELACROIX: This is crazy.
SLOAN: That's why it will be so much fun. They kiss, fall half undressed upon the motel bed.
SLOAN: That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
DELACROIX: The first and only time. A big mistake. I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
SLOAN: Work related or otherwise?
DELACROIX: Otherwise. I trust you know the difference. You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
SLOAN: DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
DELACROIX: And that's how you got me in the first place. Sloan pulls a 3/4 inch cassette out of her bag and hands it to him.
SLOAN: I want you to please view this. It may save your Life.
DELACROIX: You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
MANTAN: What you did is dead wrong.
DELACROIX: Oh, is it? Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
MANTAN: Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
DELACROIX: Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place? I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an I don't believe it.
MANTAN: I don't believe it.
DELACROIX: Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
MANTAN: How did you get this gig?
SLOAN: Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
MANTAN: You leave something out?
SLOAN: After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
MANTAN: And what?
SLOAN: And what?
MANTAN: Stop playing me Sloan.
SLOAN: Just ask me what you want to know.
MANTAN: Oh, you gonna make me say it.
