KIMBERLY: I don't see why we have to invite Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
BUFFY: Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
NICOLE: If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.

NICOLE: Well, look who's here.

BENNY: They're all the same! They're so stuck up, they're just. they're not even human. I hate them.
PIKE: Would you sleep with them?
BENNY: Yes. Definitely. Definitely. Please, God.
PIKE: Well, there it is, isn't it? You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them. What's that all I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
BENNY: I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
PIKE: Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
NICOLE: Come one, that was so weird.
BUFFY: ( uncomfortable ) What, it's not weird. I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
KIMBERLY: I can't believe they still ate it.
JENNIFER: ( to Buffy ) Where'd you learn how to do that?
BUFFY: I didn't learn. I just. it's not a big deal.
KIMBERLY: Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
BUFFY: ( annoyed ) Get a boob job.
NICOLE: It's like when we took gymnastics in eighth grade.
JENNIFER: What happened?
NICOLE: Buffy was on the uneven parallels she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
JENNIFER: You're kidding.

NICOLE: Well, that's the thing. She landed on her feet. Didn't even sprain a toe. And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this
NICOLE: ( continuing ) like she's gonna kill me.
BUFFY: I was just scared is all.
NICOLE: No. It was mondo bizarro.
KIMBERLY: Buffy, the ape-woman.
NICOLE: Seriously, Buffy. That look was way twisted. What were you thinking
PIKE: I'll have it running in a week. It's be beauty. It just needs new shocks, you know, break pads, an engine, and some wheels. It'll be totally cherry.
BENNY: When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
PIKE: You think? Split?
BENNY: Utterly. Let's bail this town. It's getting. I don't know. Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
PIKE: Our own world, where we could live and grow beans. Hundreds of beans.
BENNY: I think I'm gonna ralf.
PIKE: Don't worry, Benny. I'm here for
PIKE: ( continuing ) I'm here for you, Ralf.
AMILYN: You wanna go for a ride?
JENNIFER: What was the step after. The one from Thursday. I never learned it right, I don't think.
BUFFY: That is so cool.
NICOLE: Thank you very much.
BUFFY: Nobody is even gonna look at the Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'. You know, and a picture of the earth.
JENNIFER: Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'. You know, and a picture of the earth.
BUFFY: Don't tread on the earth?

JENNIFER: I never thought of that.
NICOLE: I gotta bail. You coming?
BUFFY: You guys blow. I'm waiting on Cassandra. She's gonna help me with my history.
NICOLE: Cassandra's really smart.
BUFFY: Yeah. She's okay, though.
NICOLE: I guess.
JEFFREY: Are you going out with Jeffrey
BUFFY: Jennifer laughs, uncomfortably.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) Don't worry, Jennifer. Someday your prince will come.
NICOLE: Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
BUFFY: The other girls leave. Buffy is alone on the empty field. She looks around her. She starts doing a routine, tentatively. Then she runs toward the middle of the field and jumps, flies into an extraordinary series of gymnastic flips and cartwheels. She rolls into one final flip, a huge one, and lands, a perfect ten, about three inches from Merrick. She screams in surprise, steps back.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) God, where the hell did you come from? You scared me to death.
MERRICK: I'm sorry. That was impressive. The. tumbling.
BUFFY: What? Oh. I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
MERRICK: I'm looking for you, actually.
BUFFY: Am I in trouble or something?
MERRICK: Not at all. My name is Merrick. I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were. complications. You should have been taught, What are you talking about?
BUFFY: What are you talking about?
MERRICK: I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
BUFFY: To bring you. your birthright.
MERRICK: To bring you. your birthright.
BUFFY: My birthright? You mean, like a trust fund?
BUFFY: ( continuing ) I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
MERRICK: You must come with me. It's much too late already. You must come with me to the graveyard.
BUFFY: Wait a minute. My birthright is in the graveyard? Later not.
MERRICK: You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you. My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
BUFFY: You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you. My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
MERRICK: You don't understand. You have been chosen.
BUFFY: Chosen to go to the graveyard? Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
MERRICK: You must believe me. You must come with me while there's still time.
BUFFY: Time to do what?
MERRICK: To stop the killing. To stop the Let me get this straight. You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's Does Elvis talk to you? Tell you to do things? Do you see spots?
BUFFY: Let me get this straight. You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's Does Elvis talk to you? Tell you to do things? Do you see spots?
MERRICK: Does Elvis talk to you? Tell you to do things? Do you see spots?
BUFFY: Does Elvis talk to you? Tell you to do things? Do you see spots?
MERRICK: I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof. You bear the mark.
MERRICK: ( continuing ) The mark of the Coven! The where's the mark? ( continuing ) The mark of the wait a minute.
MERRICK: ( continuing ) The mark of the wait a minute.
BUFFY: You mean that big hairy mole? Excuse me: eeyuu. I had it removed. And, like, knowing about my big old mole isn't proof of anything except that it's way past medication time.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) Just stay away from me, okay?
MERRICK: Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
BUFFY: Everybody does.
MERRICK: In the past. A girl. Maybe. A Magyar peasant. An Indian princess. A slave.
BUFFY: I was a slave.
MERRICK: In Virginia.
BUFFY: I don't know. It was. There was a big gram or something. And there's one, I'm like a prostitute.
MERRICK: Oh, my God. I never told anybody about this. I remember the one about the peasant, too. God, there's a bunch. Is this, like channeling or something.
BUFFY: Oh, my God. I never told anybody about this. I remember the one about the peasant, too. God, there's a bunch. Is this, like channeling or something.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) I had a dream once where I was. There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar. And I. was fighting. I'm always fighting. And there's a guy. He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always. trying to kill
MERRICK: The name has an obvious effect on the girl.
BUFFY: How do you know all this?
MERRICK: I have to show you.
BUFFY: I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
MERRICK: Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
BUFFY: Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) None of your business. God.
MERRICK: None of your business. God.
BUFFY: None of your business. God.
MERRICK: This is it.
MERRICK: ( continuing ) Robert Berman was killed three days ago. The body was found in the bushes out by the canal. Extensive tissue damage tearing at the neck and shoulders. Coroner thinks it's a dog. You sit her.
BUFFY: Wait a minute.

BUFFY: All right. What do we do now?
MERRICK: We wait for Robert to wake up.
BUFFY: Do you have any gum?
BUFFY: 'Bye now.
MERRICK: Where's the other one?
BUFFY: It leaps at her, screaming. She throws it off, as Merrick produces another stake and throws it to her. Buffy sticks it in the vampire's heart. She dies, screaming, her face still smoking, blood spurting onto Buffy. Buffy looks at herself. At the blood.
MERRICK: Go to school tomorrow. Try to act normal. Don't let anyone know what's happening. This is important. When the vampires find out who you are. you won't be hunting them All right.
BUFFY: All right.
MERRICK: Meet me at this address after school.
BUFFY: I have cheerleading squad.
MERRICK: Skip it.
BUFFY: Merrick stops.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) They can't come in, right? Unless you invite them. Is that true?
MERRICK: It's true.
BUFFY'S MOM: Do you know what time it is?
BUFFY: Uum. around ten?
BUFFY'S MOM: I knew this thing was slow.
BUFFY'S MOM: ( continuing ) You pay a fortune for something. ( calls out ) Honey, come on, we're gonna be late.
JEFFREY: Hey, baby, how ya doing? You look I do? I guess I do.
BUFFY: I do? I guess I do.
JEFFREY: Where were you last night? I called your house like four times.
BUFFY: I went to sleep. I think I have the flu or something.
JEFFREY: I can't get sick. You know training and all. I'm gonna be
BUFFY: Jeffrey moves off to class. Buffy walks on a bit. She bumps into Nicole.
NICOLE: Hey, Buffers. You look thrashed.
BUFFY: You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
NICOLE: You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
BUFFY: Oh. No. She never showed.
LOTHOS: I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many. To feel their souls coursing about me.
CASSANDRA: What's happening? What do you want?
LOTHOS: ( smiling ) So very much.
CASSANDRA: My parents have money.
LOTHOS: Yes, I'm sure they do. This place is everything you said it was,
CASSANDRA: What. are you?
LOTHOS: Are we so strange? So alien to you? I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste. it's truly heartwarming. The perfect place to spread my empire. Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place. It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.. this Mecca of consumption. The city of Angels.
LOTHOS: ( continuing ) What are we? We are man, perfected. We exist to consume. So? Do we change this one, or do we just drain her?
AMILYN: So? Do we change this one, or do we just drain her?
CASSANDRA: Here, look. My gold card. It's your. I'll never report it.
LOTHOS: She has a certain quality, this
AMILYN: I don't think this is gold.
LOTHOS: Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic. Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
CASSANDRA: No, wait. I can be dumb. Really. Or mean, or whatever. I can learn. I'm useful.
LOTHOS: Swear to God.
CASSANDRA: Swear to God.
LOTHOS: I wish you wouldn't mention him.
BUFFY: Fire the help. No kidding.
MERRICK: It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
BUFFY: Our purposes.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) What, um. What do we do?
MERRICK: There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start There's so little time.
BUFFY: Why do you keep saying that?
MERRICK: Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
BUFFY: A Vampire-King? You mean like Oh, yes. And the man from your dreams. Lothos.
MERRICK: Oh, yes. And the man from your dreams. Lothos.
BUFFY: Oh, him.
MERRICK: Yes. They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork. The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own. You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated. Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy. But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
BUFFY: ( not paying attention ) ( annoyed ) We'll cover it later.
MERRICK: ( annoyed ) We'll cover it later.
BUFFY: I still don't get how they happened to come to my town. I mean, was I born here because. because they were coming here? That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
MERRICK: In a way, yes. Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
BUFFY: Great. First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate. Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
MERRICK: ( put down his paper ) We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out. For your parents.
BUFFY: Not a pressing issue.
MERRICK: I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you. What your strengths are, your likes. Everything. What's your best subject?
BUFFY: Uh. gym.
MERRICK: Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped. Why?
BUFFY: Well, everybody says. it's just kind of dorky. I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs? They're the mighty oak. It's not a look.
MERRICK: But you enjoyed it, yes?
BUFFY: Well. I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
MERRICK: Cheerleading. For. sporting events, yes?
BUFFY: Sporting events, yeah.
MERRICK: All right. Why don't you show me a Yes, yes. It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
BUFFY: Yes, yes. It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
MERRICK: Yes, yes. It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
BUFFY: Buffy starts, a bit awkwardly, doing a cheer.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) Who we gonna beat?
MERRICK: ( pathetically following her motion ) Who we gonna beat?
BUFFY: ( stops ) No you don't have to
MERRICK: Oh. I thought. you lead me
BUFFY: No. You don't do anything. I do Oh. Good.
MERRICK: Oh. Good.
BUFFY: Who we gonna beat? Who do we defeat? Who will we be pulverizing Into cream of wheat?
BUFFY: Oh, what the hell is wrong with you? You threw a knife at my head!
MERRICK: I had to test you.
BUFFY: But you threw a knife at my head!
MERRICK: And you caught it! Only the chosen one could have done that.
BUFFY: I don't want to be the chosen one, okay? I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires! I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die. It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell. And then you come along. and. and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
MERRICK: It was necessary.
BUFFY: ( realizing ) Last night. You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
MERRICK: I don't think you understand the full implications of
BUFFY: Oh. Sorry.
MERRICK: ( getting up ) Don't you see what's happening? You're changing. You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of. ( pulling a handkerchief out of his pocket ) God, this hurts. I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working. I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
BUFFY: Put your head back.
MERRICK: Two days ago, would you have even hit me? Let alone so powerfully?
BUFFY: No. I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
MERRICK: Exactly. You're changing. You're becoming something extraordinarily
BUFFY: ( as announcer ) Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
MERRICK: Your turn.
BUFFY: What about bats? Do they turn into No. No bats, no flying. They. float, occasionally. Not really Toasty. Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
MERRICK: No. No bats, no flying. They. float, occasionally. Not really Toasty. Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
BUFFY: Toasty. Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
MERRICK: Oh, several. Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn. are any of those names familiar?
BUFFY: If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
MERRICK: Good Lord. What do you study in My nails. All right. You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps? Or Jack the Ripper?
BUFFY: My nails. All right. You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps? Or Jack the Ripper?
MERRICK: All right. You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps? Or Jack the Ripper?
BUFFY: They were vampires?
MERRICK: Same one.
BUFFY: She considers this a moment. Tees off: another hole in one.
BUFFY: Excuse me.
PRIEST: Yes, my child? Is something troubling you?
BUFFY: Well, sort of.
PRIEST: Well, maybe I can help.
BUFFY: Yeah. Um. Could you bless these?
MERRICK: . Lothos was probably born in the eleventh or twelfth century; he's been difficult to trace. His power has increased with age. It will be a long while before you are ready to face him. We'll be lucky if we can get him to leave the area, to lie low for awhile. That will scatter the rest of them. Lothos
MERRICK: ( continuing ) . is extremely powerful, but he is still a vampire, and vulnerable to the same.
MERRICK: ( continuing ) Daylight is still his enemy. The stake can still find his heart.
MERRICK: ( continuing ) I have huge antlers growing out of my buttocks.
BUFFY: ( angry ) Try to pay attention.
MERRICK: Try to pay attention.
GARY MURRAY: Well, I think we can safely say that something's going on with you, Buffy. Now, there's nothing to be nervous about; you're not in any trouble. I just hoped maybe we could talk. Don't think of me as Gary Murray, administrator. Think of me as Gary Murray, party guy! Happening dude who can talk to the young. Me and you. It's open. Tell me. It's drugs, isn't it?
GARY MURRAY: Hey, there's nothing to be afraid of! I know where you're coming from. Believe me. I'll tell you the truth. I've had my drug experiences, too. I did a lot I did some acid in the Sixties. Well, the late Seventies, actually. It was at a Doobie Brother's concert.
GARY MURRAY: . and I could see the music flowing into me, it was bright red and electric, and I felt like a big toaster, and I thought, maybe I am a toaster, we're all molecules, and my friend Melissa, her head looked like a big party balloon, and that scared me, I started to freak out.
GARY MURRAY: I guess you're surprised. Well, you know, there's more to most people than meets the eye. Everybody's got a secret. I just want you to know that you can always share your secrets with me. What you say in this office, it will stay in this office. I'm your pal.
BENNY: Pike sits up, turns down the music. He goes to the window, begins to try to open it. It's stuck.
PIKE: Benny, man, where you been? You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
BENNY: Let me in.
PIKE: Hey, I'm trying, but this window is
BENNY: Invite me in, Pike.
PIKE: Wait a minute. What's wrong with you, man?
BENNY: I'm fine.
PIKE: You look like shit, Benny.
BENNY: I. feel.. pretty.
PIKE: No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty. Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
BENNY: The sun! It burns! It burns!
BENNY: ( continuing ) Let me in, Pike! I'm hungry!
PIKE: Get away from here.
BENNY: I'm hungry.
PIKE: I mean it.
BENNY: I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm hungry!
BUFFY: Sure is cold. What a dark night. Nice night for a walk.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) 'Feelings, la la la la feelings'. Boy, I'm helpless.
BUFFY: ( continuing )
BUFFY: ( continuing )
BUFFY: ( continuing ) What do you want?
BUFFY: ( continuing ) Toaster-caked him!
MERRICK: He was slow. Very simple. They won't all be that easy.
BUFFY: And the alley was a mistake. Never corner yourself like that. If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now. One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
MERRICK: And the alley was a mistake. Never corner yourself like that. If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now. One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
BUFFY: Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
MERRICK: You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
BUFFY: Nice conversationalist! Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
MERRICK: It's natural. A reaction to their presence, to the. unnaturalness of it. It's part of how you are able to track them.
BUFFY: Oh, wonderful. My secret weapon is - PMS. That's just great. Thanks for telling me.
MERRICK: You'll get used to it. I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
BUFFY: You are such a wet.
MERRICK: A what?
BUFFY: A wet! Didn't I just kill that vampire? I think I did. I didn't see you killing any vampires. You were too busy playing 'Beat the Don't start with me again.
MERRICK: Don't start with me again.
BUFFY: Aren't I, like the chosen one? The one and only? The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me? Like, ever?
MERRICK: And why are you always wearing black? It's so down. It's totally not your color. I don't think you have a color.
BUFFY: And why are you always wearing black? It's so down. It's totally not your color. I don't think you have a color.
MERRICK: What do you want? Encouragement? 'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm Oh, fuck you!
BUFFY: Oh, fuck you!
MERRICK: Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers? Five. Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight harder than you've ever worked in your life and I saw them ripped apart. Do you want to live? Do What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
BUFFY: What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
MERRICK: What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
BUFFY: So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
MERRICK: So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
BUFFY: So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
MERRICK: Not if you're careful.
BUFFY: How can you keep doing this?
MERRICK: It's what I was raised to do. There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
BUFFY: There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge. . near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born. My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs. There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really. most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies. I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger. I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to. I shouldn't go on like this.

BUFFY: I wish you would.
MERRICK: It isn't important.
BUFFY: I'm curious, is all.
MERRICK: Buffy, don't. don't start thinking of me as your friend. It interferes with the work, and it.
BUFFY: And it makes it worse when I die, Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy. I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy. I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
MERRICK: As for example, what?
BUFFY: Well. there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
MERRICK: Vampires of the world, beware.
BUFFY: ( impressed ) Merrick. You made a joke. Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down? I know it hurts the first
JENNIFER: So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels. Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something. Like dealing.
KIMBERLY: Well, I hope so.
JENNIFER: Probably was. What do you suppose she was doing out there.
BUFFY: Coming from the opposite direction are Jeffrey, Andy and some of the other football players. They're suited up and heading for the gym.

ANDY: Absolutely. I see now the error of my mistake.
JEFFREY: Yeah, keep your mitts off my thang. I'll pop you one. Did he scare you?
BUFFY: I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY: So I noticed.
JEFFREY: ( continuing ) Nice to feel needed.
ANDY: Let's move out!
JEFFREY: ( rallying )
BUFFY: I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of. 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean? Lately it bugs me, I Merrick? Are you still breathing?
BUFFY: We call them zippers. They're not supposed to be a challenge.
MERRICK: But it's in the back. Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
BUFFY: Because you clash, Merrick. You clash with everything. I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.' Honestly, you look like something out of. My clothes have always been perfectly Well, you're on my turf now. You're just gonna have to trust me.
MERRICK: My clothes have always been perfectly Well, you're on my turf now. You're just gonna have to trust me.
BUFFY: Well, you're on my turf now. You're just gonna have to trust me.
MERRICK: I want to die.
BUFFY: ( doesn't like it either ) Okay. The important thing is not to panic.
PIKE: You said you'd have the part by two! Christ, it's almost dark.
ZEPH: What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
PIKE: I'm leaving, man. I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
ZEPH: Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
PIKE: Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
ZEPH: No. You want me to give him a You should think about leaving, too, man. Sell this place. Something's going on here. I don't know. Something real weird.
PIKE: You should think about leaving, too, man. Sell this place. Something's going on here. I don't know. Something real weird.

PIKE: I don't think so.
ZEPH: All right. Take care of yourself.
PIKE: I am.
ZEPH: Hey. What should I do if I see
PIKE: Pike peels out. Zeph watches him go.
ZEPH: That's my guitar.

LOTHOS: What's wrong with you!?!
AMILYN: My arm! He took my fucking arm!
LOTHOS: Shut up! You let him have it!
LOTHOS: ( continuing ) You reckless imbecile. This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself. twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
AMILYN: I had him in my grasp.
LOTHOS: Cheer up. You may still.
AMILYN: ( forlornly ) I look horrible.
LOTHOS: The other two the new ones. Where are they?
AMILYN: I don't know. But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
LOTHOS: ( thoughtfully ) No. Not a boy. ( gathers himself ) Find out if they're dead. And do something about that arm. Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.

BUFFY: Things are kind of confusing.
PIKE: I'll back that up.
BUFFY: Three weeks ago all I thought about was. well, I didn't actually think about anything. I definitely didn't expect this.
PIKE: I know. My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
BUFFY: It's weird. I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff. I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place. I couldn't even fit on the swings. Everything just looked so small. I'm sorry. I'm babbling.
PIKE: No, you're not.
BUFFY: I'm kinda beat. You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
PIKE: I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and You sure?

PIKE'S POV: The streets move by. On one there is a Police Officer talking to a hysterical Man. Next to them is a body, covered by a EXT. OUTSIDE SCHOOL - MORNING Buffy and Merrick are walking along the path to the steps of the main building, arguing. Merrick is wearing casual California gear, but again, very subdued.
MERRICK: There isn't time.
BUFFY: Make time, okay? You're the one who told me to act normal. I've missed three practices already. If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
MERRICK: Another distraction. It's not right.
BUFFY: Why because it's not my fate? It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
MERRICK: Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it. Your fate.
BUFFY: I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore. Come on, Merrick. Football. Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
MERRICK: All right.
BUFFY: Toasty. You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
MERRICK: Oh, I'll be there all right. I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
BUFFY: Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
MERRICK: ( being a fan ) Football is my life.
BUFFY: You're learning. Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
MERRICK: None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
BUFFY: And where are they now?
JEFFREY: So that's your tutor, huh? What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
BUFFY: Jeffrey. Projectile vomit.
COACH: Some people say winning is a state of mind. Can't win out there if you don't win in here. I say, winning isn't a state of mind. I say winning is having more points. And how do we get point? By putting the thing, the ball over the.. in the place.
AMILYN: End zone.
COACH: Right. So I don't care about your minds. Maybe you're tired. Maybe you're worried about your grades. Maybe you dog just died or you've suddenly found that you're attracted to other men. I don't care! 'Cause we're a team. And there only on thing that matters to a team. What And how do we win?

KIMBERLY: Are they so brain-dead?
VAMPIRE FAN: ANGLE - THE FIELD The players are lined up again. Grueller is drooling. The other team is really worried about him now. The snap. Andy drops back and lobs it to Jeffrey. Jeffrey is way open. He catches it easily, looks behind him as he runs. Barber players are rushing at him. And Grueller is coming at him too, throwing other players right and left. Jeffrey looks a little worried. He bolts down field, toward the end zone, Grueller on his heels.
BUFFY: In a flash, she races onto the field.
NICOLE: What is she.
JENNIFER: What is she.
KIMBERLY: Oh, wow. She's really lost it.
VAMPIRE FAN: Party hearty.

PIKE: I didn't mean it! I didn't mean
BUFFY: I didn't expect to see you.
PIKE: I know.

PIKE: I don't know. I kind of thought I ought to be here. You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
BUFFY: Besides, Oxnard sucks.
PIKE: Besides, Oxnard sucks.
PIKE: ( continuing ) Listen, I. I really do want to help. I mean, these guys are dag nasty, and somewhere my best friend is out there, and I'd like to, I don't know. Even the score. Do some damage. I'm good with damage.

PIKE: I think I could help. You gonna tell me you don't need help?
MERRICK: Did you see a girl come by here?
BIKER: You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
MERRICK: Yeah, I saw her. Bitch took my My bike! She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
BIKER: Yeah, I saw her. Bitch took my My bike! She's a lesbian, too. She told me.

BIKER: Down there.
MERRICK: Idiot girl. Can't watch over her. How long ago did
MERRICK: Oh, my God.
LOTHOS: It's a beautiful night. I have never understood the human tendency to equate darkness with emptiness. To me the black is so thick with life, like soil. like blood. Darkness writhes under my eye.
LOTHOS: ( continuing ) I know who you are. She's out her, as well, isn't she? Another Slayer. Who is it this time? What offering have you brought me?

PIKE: ( not answering )
BUFFY: ( not answering )
BUFFY: ( continuing ) Stay here.

MERRICK: This one may surprise you.
LOTHOS: I rather doubt it, if she was raised
LOTHOS: ( continuing ) Where is she? I can't wait to meet her. Do you think she's ready to face me? Or perhaps you can stop me with that gun.
MERRICK: Merrick looks out at the trees nearby.
MERRICK'S POV: Buffy appears, far away, between the trees. Merrick looks at Lothos, afraid he will notice.
LOTHOS: Look at you. You pathetic thing. So small, so full of fury. After you've served me for a hundred years, I think you'll have a little more I don't think so.
MERRICK: I don't think so.
LOTHOS: He looks at the blood on his fingers. After a moment, he tastes EXT. STREET ( LATER ) Pike is standing by the trees where Buffy stood before, looking out into the street.
PIKE'S POV: The same angle as Buffy's, before. Now Lothos is gone. Buffy is kneeling quietly by Merrick, holding his head in her lap.
BUFFY: Ummm, our Father, Who art in Heaven, duhmm. hallowed be Thy name. Uhh, kingdom come, daily break, I don't know. I don't even know if you're religious. You probably are. But you're dead, you know. You're just totally dead. and.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) . and I don't know what to do. You were the one who. I don't know if the training was over. I don't even know if I passed. You're so stupid! How could you be so stupid? What am I supposed to do without you? You son of a bitch!
BUFFY: ( continuing )
ZEPH: Hah, I'd knew you'd be back. Didn't I say you'd be back? Ha, ha, ha! You're sitting in your old car saying 'Nope, I'm never coming back.' Hee, Hee! Like you got anywhere to go. 'I'm never coming back' But I knew you would. Birds got to return to the nest sooner or later. That's what I said. Just like I told you.
ZEPH: ( continuing ) Hah! Shot the damn tire, dumbass, didn't even look, just going around shooting things, popped it flat, ya
JENNIFER: I got all the plastic stuff. What should I do with it?
KIMBERLY: ( "you idiot" ) Throw it out.
NICOLE: I really was way way too too.
KIMBERLY: Oh, please! When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
NICOLE: I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?' And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!' Way mental.
JENNIFER: Hi, Buffy.
BUFFY: Hi, guys.
KIMBERLY: You were supposed to be here at I forgot.
BUFFY: I forgot.
KIMBERLY: Buffy, what is your sitch? You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
BUFFY: Look, a lot's been going on. That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you. You see. a while ago, I met this guy
KIMBERLY: Oh my God you're having an affair.
NICOLE: Does Jeffrey know?
JENNIFER: Does Jeffrey know?

BUFFY: Guys. Guys! Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
KIMBERLY: Oh, thank you very much.

KIMBERLY: You're so out of it. You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee
BUFFY: Excuse me for having something important to do.
KIMBERLY: This isn't important? The earth is our home.
BUFFY: Kimberly, it's a dance. It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
NICOLE: So, we're stupid now?

BUFFY'S POV: Pike is there, walking in on his own. He wears a leather jacket and baggy old tux pants, accented by chains, earring and unlaced Doc Martins. He looks great. He walks directly toward Buffy, and does turn a few heads.
PIKE: I crashed your party.
BUFFY: Pretty shallow of you.
PIKE: That's me.
BUFFY: I'm glad you came.
PIKE: Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
PIKE: ( continuing ) Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?

PIKE: Yeah, well, you're the one I'm afraid
PIKE: ( continuing; gee-whizzically ) You know, you're not like the other

PIKE: There's gotta be a back way out of here, or something. I'm going out the front.
BUFFY: I'm going out the front.
PIKE: Are you nuts, Buffy? There's a hundred of them out there. They'll rip us apart.
BUFFY: You're staying here. Some of them might not come after me. If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
PIKE: You say that like it's a bad thing.
ANDY: Buffy, this is crazy. What do these guys want?
BUFFY: Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) Good thing one of us was prepared.
PIKE: Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
BUFFY: Don't piss me off.
PIKE: ( to himself ) Come on, move.
PIKE: Others are watching as well. Andy comes up with some chair- made stakes, hands some to Pike.
KIMBERLY: It's okay! I think they're going after her!
PIKE: ( to Kimberly ) I'll bet you feel stupid.
GARY MURRAY: Let's get away from these windows! Find something to cover them with.
PIKE: Bring round the table.
NICOLE: There's nails and stuff we used to put everything up.
PIKE: Get 'em.
JENNIFER: Oh, yes! Yes!
JEFFREY: Oh, baby!
JENNIFER: Make me a woman! Yes! Make me a
BUFFY: ( pissed ) That was quick! ( looking up )
JEFFREY: ( whining )
JENNIFER: ( whining )
JEFFREY'S POV: Vampires swarm about the car in pursuit of Buffy. Jeffrey goes wide-eyed at the sight. Starts climbing off Jennifer and into the driver's seat.
JEFFREY: ( terrified ) Well, I'm done. Are you done?

JEFFREY: Okay, let's go.
JENNIFER: CUT TO:
PIKE: The heart! Stab them in the heart!
BENNY: Isn't this great, Pike? Isn't it great? Finally got those bitches on the run.
BENNY: ( continuing ) Of course I'm angry! I leave you alone for five minutes, and look who you're hanging out with!
BENNY: ( continuing ) I don't want girls with good taste; I want a girl that tastes good!
BENNY: ( continuing ) I was gonna change you, man. I was gonna give you life! Do you know what that means?
BENNY: Never die. Never get kicked around, never get busted.
BENNY: ( continuing ) It means never having to say you're sorry! And you blow it all off for that slut?! What about my needs?!
BENNY: ( cattily, to herself ) 'Ooh, make me a woman, Jeffrey. oh, Jeffrey, you're so atheletical. I love you.'
AMILYN: All clear? Pleased to meet you! Won't you guess my It wouldn't be 'Dick,' would it?
AMILYN: Pleased to meet you! Won't you guess my It wouldn't be 'Dick,' would it?
BUFFY: ( defiantly, through the pain ) It wouldn't be 'Dick,' would it?
BUFFY: ( continuing ) You're a fool, bloodbag. Die a fool and go to hell!
AMILYN: You're a fool, bloodbag. Die a fool and go to hell!
AMILYN: ( continuing ) The chosen one. You're just another bloodbag not even fit to die for the Master. When will you ever
BUFFY: ( with difficulty ) I do know. one thing.
AMILYN: I know. what time sunrise is.
BUFFY: I know. what time sunrise is.
AMILYN: He turns in horror, letting go of Buffy, trying to catch the shade. The instant he releases her, Buffy grabs the stake and in one swift motion, buries it in Amilyn's back. The shade goes up, flapping loudly as it spins. It is still pitch black out. Amilyn stare, wide-eyed and silent, at the night as he dies.
BUFFY: It's in about four hours, Dick.
BUFFY: Oh, god, no. not yet.
LOTHOS: I knew you'd come.
LOTHOS: ( continuing ) You knew it, too, didn't you? All your life, dreaming. waiting to feed me.
LOTHOS: ( continuing ) Ah, my fool is dead. He was careless, always. Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that. ( coming toward her ) Don't you understand? I've killed you a dozen times. Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath. I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes. A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
BUFFY: ( breaking the spell ) Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
LOTHOS: And she is up, turning to run. He is thrown momentarily by her insolence.
LOTHOS: You waste time. That is a sin.
LOTHOS: ( continuing ) You're even weaker than the others.
BUFFY: I think you've forgotten something.
LOTHOS: This? This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
BUFFY: With her other hand, Buffy holds up her hair spray.
BUFFY: ( continuing ) . my keen fashion sense.
BUFFY: This is the suckiest party I have ever been to. It's not even a
BUFFY: CUT TO:
KIMBERLY: Don't let her in! Don't let her
KIMBERLY: ( continuing ) They'll kill us! Get her out!
PIKE: Are you okay?
BUFFY: Get away from me!
LOTHOS: You bitch!
LOTHOS: ( continuing ) You would challenge me?
LOTHOS: ( continuing; to Buffy ) I'll rip the flesh from your stinking
LOTHOS: ( continuing ) I am a God! A God!
BUFFY: I am so sure.
LOTHOS: It doesn't. hurt. as much as I had imagined.
GARY MURRAY: Just a minute, you! I'm not finished with you!
JENNIFER: She was even crazier after that. I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
KIMBERLY: Jennifer nods. Kimberly wrinkles her nose in distaste.
JENNIFER: She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school. All year. She didn't even go to the prom.
JEFFREY: I heard she got straight A's.
JEFFREY: ( continuing ) That's what I heard.
KIMBERLY: The worst is, her parents this is true her parents were gonna send her to the Bahamas for graduation, and she refused. True story. She said she didn't want to go. It is to vomit.
BOY: Well, where is she now?
PIKE: I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off. We could maybe wait till later.
BUFFY: Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
PIKE: Who's afraid? Besides me, I mean.
BUFFY: We've come all this way. We just have to check it out. I got a hunch.
PIKE: You're the boss, boss. I just thought maybe we should wait. Trust me.
BUFFY: Trust me.
