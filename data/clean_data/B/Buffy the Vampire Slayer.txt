EXT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - JUST BEFORE SUNSET: We see an Italian village at the height of the plague.  Funeral processions, decrepit houses with their windows boarded up... the stench of death all around.
TITLE:  EUROPE. THE DARK AGES: Through the filth a KNIGHT walks his horse.  He is weary but not so dingy as his surrounding; a stranger in these parts. He comes to an inn, where a boy takes his horse round back. He enters the inn.
INT. INN - SAME TIME: The inn is dark and almost empty.  A couple of patrons drink silently at tables.  Behind the bar stands a slovenly BARMAID, dark-haired and lazy.  She scratches at her shoulder, on which we see a birthmark.  The knight approaches the bar, throws money down.
INT. INN - UPSTAIRS HALL/BEDROOM - NIGHT: The barmaid leads the knight, by candlelight, upstairs to his room.  The door opens inward.  The knight stands in the doorway, places a hand on the barmaid's hip.  She pauses a moment, then breaks free of his grasp, starts down the hall.  He laughs a bit, resignedly, and closes the door. A VAMPIRE stands behind it.  Not two feet from the knight, grinning at him.  His eyes are skull-hollow and dancing in his head, his bloody smile full with teeth.  His skin is gray, and peeling.  The knight turns slowly and sees him.
ANGLE ON DOOR: It suddenly flies open, the lock shattered. The vampire turns like a frightened animal.  In the doorway stands the barmaid, a SLAYER.  In her hand is a wooden stake. The vampire drops the knight, who crabs backwards into a corner. The Slayer and the vampire come at each other.  The Slayer spins and kicks; the vampire flies back.  Snarling, he comes back at the slayer.  They struggle; he slips free and is out the door. For a moment, the Slayer remains still, crouched on the floor. The knight watches her.  She seems to be making a decision -- perhaps even knows what is going to happen. She runs at the window.
EXT. IN FRONT OF THE INN - SAME TIME: The vampire comes running out the front door.  Before he is a few feet from the front of the inn, the Slayer SMASHES through the upstairs window and lands on him.  They both hit the ground, and she plants the stake right in his heart. After a moment, we hear a voice:
INT. ENGLISH CASTLE - NIGHT: Lightning flashes outside the window.  It is torrenting rain. An old MAN speaks to a hysterical GIRL of sixteen or so.  They are both obviously noble of birth.
CLOSEUP - A HAND: The hand is lifted high, but it is not the girl's.  It holds not a stake, but a pom-pom.
EXT. HEMERY HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - WIDER SHOT - DAY: Opening CREDITS OVER: A football game in progress.  The stands are pretty full, the crowd enthusiastic.  The hemery football stadium is just that; a real stadium, not just makeshift stands on grass. On  the sidelines are the Hemery cheerleaders, led by BUFFY. She is blonde (in nature as in name), pretty, and very gracefully athletic.  She obviously enjoys what she is doing, and she's good at it. With her on the squad are JENNIFER and NICOLE, two of her best friends.  Beside them the COACH, yelling at the players.  The scoreboard reads HEMERY VS. SETON. On the field are JEFFREY, wide receiver (and Buffy's boyfriend), ANDY, quarterback, and GRUELLER, the huge left tackle. Buffy and the crowd wince as Andy is sacked for a nine-yard loss.
INT. THE MALL - AFTERNOON: The mall is typically busy.  Buffy, Nicole, Jennifer and KIMBERLY can bee seen making their way through it.  They are all dressed very similarly:  bright colors, a lot of white and pink.  Not trashy, but mainstream and uninspired.  Esprit. All of them carry shopping bags; they've done a good days work.
TITLE:  CALIFORNIA. THE LITE AGES: The girls pass by stores, vaguely window shopping.
INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY: The film is in progress.  This has no effect on the girls, however, as they continue to talk ceaselessly.  They all have diet sodas.
ANGLE - THE MOON: Fat and yellow, behind the clouds.  We hear a long HOWL.
EXT. THE MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT: Jeffrey pulls into the parking lot in his BMW convertible. Grueller, howling, sits in the back behind Jeffrey and Andy. They park and hop out, head toward the entrance.
EXT. THE PARK - SAME TIME: Grueller walks through the trees, enters an enclosed clearing of grass.  He hears something, stops.  Maybe his name, maybe just the BUSHES RUSTLING.  He looks about him, hesitantly. Starts forward, stops again.
ANGLE - PIKE AND BENNY: Crossing a street, turning and listening.
ANGLE - JEFFREY'S CAR: Speeding by, everyone packed into it.  Andy howls back at Grueller, mistaking his intent.  He settles back.  The girls are looking at him.
INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - ANGLE ON TV - NIGHT: We see another full moon, this one on the TV screen.  "Dracula" is on, Lugosi's original. The lights are off in the living room as Jeffrey enters from the kitchen, sits down on the couch holding a bag of munchies. Buffy is still in the kitchen, making corn.  Jeffrey flicks the remote, changes channels.
ANGLE - THE TV: The movie is replaced by the local news, in mid-broadcast.  A NEWSCASTER sits at his deck, a super of a teenage girl behind him.
INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME: Buffy's FATHER walks purposefully into the kitchen holding a suitcase that he plops by the front door.  He crosses out again as Buffy's MOM crosses in, also with luggage.
ANGLE - THE TV: "Dracula" reappears.
INT. 18TH CENTURY CHINESE WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT: Not, by any stretch, an upscale joint.  Dark, cramped, and scummy.  A young Chinese Whore sits on a bed, wearing little enough that we can see the telltale birthmark on her shoulder. A repulsive British SAILOR is dressing, his business finished. Looking disgusted, he throws his payment on the bed.  For some reason, the bed is littered with popcorn.
INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING: Buffy is thrashing in bed.  Jeffrey is holding her by the shoulders and shaking her.
INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - SAME TIME: Dark, cavernous -- walls hewn from rock, lit torches clamped to them.  Cold stone floor and in the foreground, a dark pool of blood.  A HUM, possibly a chant, fills the air. A figure steps up to the pool, his back to the CAMERA, and kneels before it.  He holds his hand over the surface of the blood.  As he speaks, his voice an urgent hiss, we TRACK AROUND him, see that it is Amilyn.
CLOSEUP - AMILYN'S HAND: A hand shoots out of the pool and grabs Amilyn's.  Amilyn leans over and fervently kisses it.
EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY: Buffy sits with Nicole, Jennifer, Kimberly and CASSANDRA. Cassandra is not quite in the same league as the other girls -- for one thing, she studies.  She's not as glamorous, nor a vacuous.
EXT. THE CITY - NIGHT: We see SHOTS of the deserted city at night.  It's a small, upscale town.  Suburban streets, businesses, and a  few more depressed areas, boarded up houses.  No one is out.  TREES RUSTLE, shadows flicker, but the curling mist is the only visible presence.
INT. CAFE BLASE - NIGHT: A classic faux-Fifties L.A. diner.  Pictures of Frankie and Annette, bright lights, those same tired Fifties standards playing on the JUKEBOX.  Buffy, Kimberly, Jennifer and Nicole are sitting at the end of the counter, at the corner.
GIRLS' POV: Pike and Benny have entered the diner, quite drunk.  As they pass the jukebox, Benny gives it a kick and the music stops. A few people look up, annoyed, as they approach the counter.
ANGLE - BUFFY'S HAND: It closes silently around the knife at her place. Buffy is still looking at Benny, she seems to be hypnotizing him, and maybe even herself.  The NOISE in the diner seems to FADE AWAY for a moment.  Buffy shifts slightly, almost a twitch, and the spell is broken.  The SOUND RETURNS, Buffy looks away, letting go of the knife exactly where it was. Benny looks down.  His hot dog has been sliced neatly down to about an inch.  He is shocked.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT: Pike and Benny have left the diner and are walking down the street.  Pike produces a bottle of Mezcal from his coat pocket and takes a swig, hand it to Benny.  They continue to pass it back and forth.
INT. DINER - NIGHT: The girls have all finished their sundaes.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT: Perhaps in answer, we see the same shadowy figure moving behind Pike and Benny as they continue to walk home.  They're really bombed now.  They are somewhere in the hills now, and they come to the edge of a steep incline overlooking the valley.  A waist-high concrete wall is built into the side of the earth. They stand below a thick, green tree.
CLOSEUP - BENNY: Still waiting to throw up.  The figure approaches slowly from behind him.  The figure is a few feet away from him when a hand shoots down from above and grabs Benny's face.
ANGLE - IN THE TREE: Amilyn sits on a low branch, pulls Benny up to face him.  Amilyn has changed his manner of dress drastically.  He wears a motorcycle jacket and sunglasses.  His hair is punked out. Benny is in shock, as Amilyn holds him easily by his shirt collar.
ANGLE - THE PICTURE: It is a ten year old girl about to blow out the candles on her birthday cake.  The cake reads, "Happy Birthday, Buffy".
EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - AFTERNOON: Buffy, Nicole and Jennifer and another cheerleader are practicing.
ANGLE - THE SUN: Thick and orange, sinking beyond the hills.
EXT. GRAVEYARD - SUNSET: Merrick leads Buffy, searching for a particular grave.
ANGLE - SUNSET: The last red glimmer disappears behind the hills.
EXT. OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL - SAME TIME: Cassandra stands waiting for Buffy.  The sun is down, darkness increasing.  She looks at her watch and gives up, heads for her car.  Her key in the door, she hears a RUSTLING behind her.  Looks slowly around.
EXT. GRAVEYARD - SAME TIME: Buffy sits fidgeting.  Playing with her fingernails.  Merrick stays in the position, listening. A low, almost inaudible MOAN come from under the ground.  Buffy sits up straight, holds the cross to her.  The MOAN becomes louder, almost a scream.  The SOUND is followed by the SOUND of FINGERS SCRAPPING wood -- of WOOD SPLINTERING -- of digging. The moaning continues, becoming eerier, somewhat more articulate. Buffy and Merrick wait.
ANGLE - THE GRAVE: Finally, fingers break through the ground and hold stiff in the open air.  The moan becomes a triumphant HISS.  The fingers clutch at the ground. ROBERT BERMAN pops halfway out of his grave like a jack-in-the- box, his face dirty and dead-white.  He sees Buffy in front of him, and he bobs toward her with a crazy grin, stretching as to a mother's tit. Merrick drops down behind Robert and grabs him, raising the stake.  Buffy watches, immobilized. A pair of arms shoot up from the ground right under Buffy. They grab her and pull her to the ground.  Next to her face, the face of another vampire, a YOUNG WOMAN, emerges grinning from the crumbling earth. Buffy screams lustily, and struggles to break free. Merrick is momentarily distracted by this, and Robert throws him off, and pulls himself out of the grave.  Merrick falls to the ground, and his stake goes flying. Buffy pulls herself out of the girl's grasp, starts running away, but the girl grabs her.  Buffy remembers the cross in her hand, spins and holds it to the vampire's forehead.  It burns and the lady lets go, screaming and falling to the ground.
ANGLE - MERRICK AND ROBERT: They are struggling, several feet away.  Robert grabs Merrick by the shoulders and picks him up, preparing to bite him.  A stake suddenly pops out of his chest, planted in his back by Buffy.  He falls and dies.
EXT. FRONT OF BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT: Merrick walks Buffy to the door.  She is silent, slow.
INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - FOYER - SAME TIME: Buffy shuts the door, turns to go up to her room.  She is startled by someone standing in her path.  She almost screams. It's her mother.  She stands, arm akimbo, looking very confrontational.  Buffy looks a sight, and stands uncomfortably in front of her mother for a moment.
INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT: Buffy stands at the sink, washing her shirt.  She tries to get the blood off with fierce intensity.  She is near tears.
INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT: She sits in the middle of the bed in her pajamas, the blankets pooled around her.  She cannot sleep.  Finally, she lies back on the pillow. Lothos is beside her.
INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY: Buffy walks through the hall slowly, obviously the worse for last night's wear.  Gary Murray comes up next to her, looking at his watch pointedly:  she's late for class.  He moves on. Jeffrey, going the other way, stops next to her.
INT. LOTHOS' CAVE - CLOSEUP OF CASSANDRA'S FACE: She is waking up, obviously from being knocked out.  She blinks stupidly, looks around.  She is lying by a pool of what looks to be dark water in a large cave.  Torches burn around her. She tries to get up and finds it difficult.  She pulls herself up to the side of the pool and splashes water on her face. It's blood. She starts, staring with growing horror at her hands.  She does not even see the figure rise from the pool at first. It's Lothos.  He wears no shirt, only white trousers and boots, the style maybe Nineteenth Century.  No blood seems to touch him as he rises.  He looks at Cassandra with an almost sleepy lust.
INT. WAREHOUSE - AFTERNOON: Grey, dusty and long since abandoned.  Sunlight pours in through the large windows, practically caked with dust.  Old crates are stacked here and there, bits of manikins leaning on one or two.  Merrick sits on a crate, reading the newspaper. Buffy enters hesitantly, puts down her bookbag next to a pile of Merrick's stuff, including a rolled-up sleeping bag.  This is definitely not her turf.  She runs her finger along a crate, picks up a world of dust.  She holds up her finger at Merrick.
CLOSEUP - MERRICK'S HAND: We see a knife slip out of Merrick's sleeve.  He palms it, hands behind his back. In the middle of her routine, he hurls it at her.  She catches it, reflexively, inches from her face.  Stops dead.  Then bursts into tears.  Merrick is thrown off by this reaction.
A SERIES OF IMAGES AND INTERCUT SCENES: Buffy's period of training.  Over the difficult course of it, she is obviously becoming more self-possessed, more at ease. Her style of dress loosens a bit:  a little punkier.  Stops dying her hair blonde and her roots start showing.  Accumulates a few more holes in her ears.
EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT: Buffy doing a series of gymnastic flips, swinging on vines, etc.
EXT. SCHOOL - DAY: Buffy arriving late for class.
INT. BRENTANO'S - DAY: Buffy charging some books: Lawson's Treatis on Demonology, Psychological Interpretations of Vampirism, The Book of the Dead, and The Complete Garlic Cookbook.
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT: Merrick sits on a crate, reading the obituaries and circling certain entries. Buffy stands on her head, sweating with concentration.  The CAMERA TILTS up to reveal her feet.  Between the toes of one is a nail brush, with which she is very carefully painting her toenails.
INT. MELROSE CLOTHING STORE ("ROCK STAR") - NIGHT: Amilyn and a few of the old-world vampires are on a spree, trying on various leather jackets.  As they cavort, the CAMERA TRACKS behind the counter, where we find the clerk, bloody and dead, slumped on the floor.
EXT. SCHOOL - DAY: Buffy kissing Jeffrey goodbye after school.  A long, lingering kiss, during which she pulls away, anxious to get going.  She starts off, comes back and plants a big ol' on his lips one last time before splitting.
EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - AFTERNOON: Merrick and Buffy are playing.  Merrick tees off, shoots horribly.
EXT. WAREHOUSE  (LATER): Buffy and Merrick sparring, working their way in between the "trees."  She is his superior in speed and strength, but he easily trips her up.  She glares at him from the ground.
INT. SCHOOL - DAY: Buffy late again.  Gary Murray watches her from the hall, shaking his head.
EXT. ROADSIDE - EVENING: Two college-age guys stand hitchhiking.  A red convertible pulls up, with a beautiful blonde behind the wheel.  The guys look at each other -- all right!  They can't see her teeth, or the look in her eye.
INT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON: Buffy walks in, looks around.  She approaches a PRIEST.
INT. LOTHOS' CAVE - NIGHT: We see the entire cave, the still pool of blood, the torches lit.  At the far end sits Lothos.  In his arms is the body of a dead girl.  Blood stains her neck and yet the image is poetic, reminiscent of Michelangelo's "Pieta".  They are both perfectly still, her draped across his lap, he with his eyes far far away.  The silence holds. Lothos belches massively.
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT: Merrick is lecturing Buffy.  Buffy is sitting, doodling in an open notebook, "uh-huh"ing and obviously not paying attention.
ANGLE - BUFFY'S NOTEBOOK: Merrick slams a stake right through the middle of it.  Buffy screams, jumps back a good two feet and lands on her butt.
INT. WAREHOUSE - LATE LATE NIGHT: Merrick talking.  Buffy drinking coffee, trying hard to stay awake.  Listening.
INT. SCHOOL - DAY: Buffy in class, taking a test.  Nicole leaning over, trying to cheat off her when she falls forward onto the desk, asleep.
INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY: Buffy being ushered into Gary Murray's office.
INT. GARY MURRAY'S OFFICE - DAY: Buffy sits in his chair.  Gary moves about his desk, sitting behind it, leaning on it, talking to her.  A FLY BUZZES annoyingly about his head.
EXT. FOREST - AFTERNOON: Buffy stands under a tree, blindfolded.  Merrick stands a ways apart, watching.  Buffy stands very still, neck craned, waiting. Silently, a leaf falls.  It wafts gently down.  Buffy hurls a knife at it with easy precision.
ANGLE - ANOTHER TREE: The knife stick deep into the trunk, the leaf perfectly pinned. Merrick looks at it.  Buffy smiles, knowing she has hit the target.  Blindfold still on, she turns toward Merrick and walks into a branch, falls heavily backwards.
INT. GARY MURRAY'S OFFICE - DAY: The same session, continuing.  Buffy still sits, expressionless, in the chair.  The FLY still BUZZES.
INT. THE MALL - DAY: Buffy at the mall with Kimberly, Nicole and Jennifer.  For the first time, we really see how she stands out against her friends.  She is wearing much more functional, cool garb, and less makeup, while they still sport the same dainty shit from the beginning. They stop to look at some dresses.  Something in the next store catches Buffy's eye; she wanders off.
INT. GARY MURRAY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME: Gary Murray is crouching on his desk.  Buffy still sits.  The FLY still BUZZES. As Gary talks, Buffy picks up a push pin from the table beside her, holds it.
INT. THE MALL - DAY: The other girls are moving on from the dress shop, notice Buffy is not with them.  They spot her in the next shop, urge her to come on.  Buffy puts back the chain saw she was looking at, follows them.
INT. GARY MURRAY'S OFFICE - DAY: Buffy hasn't moved, or opened her mouth.  The FLY BUZZES on. Gary Murray now sits behind his desk.
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT: Buffy sparring with Merrick again.  She holds a stake.  This time she ends up pinning him, the stake at his solar plexus. He moves the point to where his heart would be.
INT. PIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT: The room is a shambles.  Outside the first floor window, it is dark night.  "Help Yourself" by the Posies blasts from Pike's STEREO.  Pike lies on his bed. Through the window we see Benny approach, slowly fading up to the pane.  He's floating, really.  (He's a vampire.)  He scrapes his fingers on the glass.
EXT. DESERTED STREET - NIGHT: Buffy walks slowly down the street, trying to appear nonchalant, but looking about her a lot.
CLOSEUP - A STOPWATCH: A hand stops it.  It is Merrick, who steps into the alley and stares at Buffy.
EXT. OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT: The two exit Merrick's car, an old Dodge Dart.  As they talk, they make their way into the warehouse.  Buffy looks out for trouble while Merrick unlocks the door.  This is obviously their routine.
INT. THE WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME: They unload their stuff as they argue.
INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY: Buffy, Nicole, Kimberly, and Jennifer are walking down the hall.
INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY: A mod, brightly lit store.  A little hipper than your usual mall fare, but not Melrose either.  Bright colors reign.  Buffy is standing by a dressing stall, inspecting her fingernails, talking to Merrick as he changes inside.
EXT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - LATE AFTERNOON: Pike is hurriedly working on a part in the hood of his beat-up Dodge, which is filled with all his belongings.  ZEPH stands watching him.  Zeph is about forty-five, greasy, good-natured. Pike works for him.
ANGLE - THE SUN: burning down.
INT. PIKE'S CAR - NIGHT: On the edge of town.  The car has stalled at an intersection. Pike is hunched over the wheel, his head down as he listens to the rasping ENGINE.
ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR: Pike races at Amilyn, but he leaps up as Pike reaches him, and Pike hears a THUD as Amilyn lands on the roof of his car. Pike continues to bullet down the street as a hand suddenly punches through the roof, grabbing at him.  He fights off the hand and tries to control the speeding car. It can't be done:  he goes off the road and into a park.  The car careens along.
ANGLE - ON TOP OF THE CAR: Amilyn ride it, laughing.
ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR: Pike spots a tree with a low branch and heads for it.  Still fighting, he aims at the branch.  It gets closer.
ANGLE - ON TOP OF THE CAR: Amilyn looks up.
ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR: They pass under the branch and we hear a TEARING THUD.  The arm stiffens and falls into Pike's lap. The car hits another tree dead on.  Pike slams into the steering wheel.  The guitar case flies right through the windshield and lands on the grass. Pike pulls himself slowly from the car.  He is bleeding, but not badly.  Just shaken.  He hears a low, seething WAIL from a few yards back and turns around.  Amilyn is getting shakily to his feet.
INT. BOILER ROOM - CLOSEUP ON AMILYN - NIGHT: Thrashing about the room in hysterics, screaming and snarling, banging his one fist on the boiler tank.  It booms hollowly. Lothos grabs him, throws him up against the wall.
INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT: Buffy and Pike walk in, Pike still a bit unsteady on his feet.
EXT. BUS TERMINAL: A bus is pulling out.  We see Pike through the window, looking comtemplative.  He watches the terminal disappear.
PIKE'S POV: The streets move by.  On one there is a Police Officer talking to a hysterical Man.  Next to them is a body, covered by a sheet.
EXT. OUTSIDE SCHOOL - MORNING: Buffy and Merrick are walking along the path to the steps of the main building, arguing.  Merrick is wearing casual California gear, but again, very subdued.
EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT: Right before the game.  The scoreboard reads "Hemery vs Barber". Fans fill the stands.  We see Buffy with the other cheerleaders. She's really into it, enjoying herself as they all rally the crowd. We see Merrick taking a seat.  He is wearing another new outfit -- a letterman jacket and baseball cap.  He has binoculars around his neck.  He takes his seat amidst the teens.  Real inconspicuous.
INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME: The coach is giving players his pep talk.
INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - SAME TIME: The players run out toward the field, yelling.  The last of them is Grueller.  He floats behind them slowly, grinning and speaking in a passionless voice, again as if he were repeating words phonetically.
EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD  (LATER): Fourth quarter.  The scoreboard read "Hemery: 17, Barber: 21". Fifty seconds left.
ANGLE - MERRICK: He is watching Buffy through his binoculars.  A TEEN nudges him.
ANGLE - THE FIELD: The players are lined up.  Grueller, at left tackle, smiles at the player facing him, growls.  The player looks worried.
ANGLE - BUFFY: Watching the game, a little perplexed.
ANGLE - THE STANDS: Merrick watches Buffy.
ANGLE - THE SIDELINES: The coach yells at the players.
ANGLE - GRUELLER: Smiling, listening to Andy call the play.
ANGLE - ANOTHER SECTION IN THE STANDS: Kimberly sits, complaining to no one in particular.
ANGLE - THE FIELD: The players are lined up again.  Grueller is drooling.  The other team is really worried about him now. The snap.  Andy drops back and lobs it to Jeffrey.  Jeffrey is way open.  He catches it easily, looks behind him as he runs. Barber players are rushing at him.  And Grueller is coming at him too, throwing other players right and left. Jeffrey looks a little worried.  He bolts down field, toward the end zone, Grueller on his heels.
ANGLE - BUFFY: She sees something is definitely wrong.
ANGLE - MERRICK: He stands, his eyes following Buffy.
ANGLE - KIMBERLY: She also see Buffy.
ANGLE - THE CLOCK: Two, one, zero.
ANGLE - THE FIELD: Grueller hits Jeffrey a second before he is enveloped by other players.  Grueller, hungry with bloodlust, is confused by the exultant crowd, snarling at people. Buffy races for the crowd.  She sees Jeffrey is all right. Grueller makes his way out of the throng and up into the stands even as everyone else is rushing onto the field. Jeffrey is triumphant.  He sees Buffy running for him and raises his arms.  She passes him right by and continues after Grueller, heads up the stands.  He looks after her, confused, before he is swamped again.
ANGLE - MERRICK: He tries to make his way through the crowd.
ANGLE - TOP OF THE STANDS: Grueller reaches them and leaps over the back.  Buffy sees him, runs up and without hesitation, dives off herself. The stands reach some thirty feet off the ground.  Buffy sails down like a diver, grabs a branch about halfway down.  She swings like a gymnast and the branch snaps.  Still holding the broken branch, she completes a perfect flip and lands on her feet. The vampire fan is on the ground behind her, come for her and without stopping or even turning she twirls the branch and sinks the broken end in his heart. She looks around for Grueller.  He is booking out, already several yards away.. Merrick appears at the top of the stands just in time to see Buffy take off after Grueller.
ANGLE - MERRICK: Running back down the stands, making his way through the dispersing crowd to the nearest exit.
EXT. STREET - SAME TIME: Buffy is still following, but she can't keep up.  She spot a BIKER tooling along the street on a Harley.  She comes up to the side of the road and tentatively sticks her thumb out. The biker smiles, stops in front of her.
ANGLE - THE BIKE: Ground level, behind the bike, we see its engine revving, smoke puffing from twin pipes.
ANGLE - THE BIKE: The same angle as before, ground level.  Suddenly the biker's body lands in front of CAMERA
CLOSEUP - WHEEL: spinning
CLOSEUP - HAND: revving the engine. Buffy takes off at top speed.
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE  (MOMENTS LATER): A RUSTLING in the trees signifies Grueller's flight.  Seconds late, Buffy roars into view behind him.  She navigates the streets with less ease than determination. Her eyes follow him off the road and she steers the bike on a violently bumpy and erratic course through the site.  She finally hits a pile of bricks and is thrown headlong from the bike.  She hits the ground hard; she rolls into it but has trouble getting up.
BUFFY'S POV: Grueller's smiling face appears over her.
RESUME SCENE: He grabs her and hauls her up.
ANGLE - KIMBERLY'S CAR: She drives by, see Buffy with Pike.  It's an eyebrow-raiser, but she keeps driving.
EXT. STREET - SAME TIME: Merrick runs up to the street where Buffy took the Harley.  He has shed the raccoon coat.  The biker is still there, standing in the road trying to thumb a ride.
ANGLE - THE BIKER: On his knees, Lothos' hand firmly locked around his throat. He cannot move or breathe. Merrick and Lothos look at each other a moment.
EXT. ANOTHER STREET - ANGLE ON BUFFY - SAME TIME: She is crouching on the ground, holding her stomach and gritting her teeth.
EXT. STREET - ANGLE ON THE BIKER - SAME TIME: Lothos lets him go and he falls, dead.
CLOSEUP - THE GUN: Merrick holds it firm behind his back, finger on the trigger.
MERRICK'S POV: Buffy appears, far away, between the trees. Merrick looks at Lothos, afraid he will notice.
ANGLE - BUFFY: Approaching, stopping some twenty yards away.  She looks about her for a weapon.
CLOSEUP - LOTHOS: Even twenty yards away, he hears.  He spins and stares, starest at CAMERA.  Listening. Buffy walks slowly, silently backward, fading back into the dark, terrified and shocked. Lothos turns back and looks at Merrick dead in his hands. Disgusted, he lets him drop.
EXT. STREET  (LATER): Pike is standing by the trees where Buffy stood before, looking out into the street.
PIKE'S POV: The same angle as Buffy's, before.  Now Lothos is gone.  Buffy is kneeling quietly by Merrick, holding his head in her lap.
EXT. A WOOD - JUST BEFORE DAWN: Through the dark mist Buffy appears, carrying Merrick's body in her arms.  She is alone.  She does not stop.
EXT. GRAVEYARD - MORNING: On the outskirts of the graveyard, Buffy finishes filling in Merrick's grave under an old tree.  She is still wearing her cheerleader outfit, now caked with dirt.  She stands at the foot of the grave, tries to think of a prayer.
INT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - DAY: Pike is at work on a contraption.  Built out of scraps and parts, it is the beginnings of a cartridge-load crossbow. Zeph watches, behind him.
INT. GYM - DAY: We see a banner stretched across the central beam of the ceiling.  It reads "THE EARTH IS OUR HOME".  A half dozen inflatable globes dangle from the ceiling.  Nicole and Kimberly are stetting up the drinks table, unloading and stacking hundreds of styrofoam cups.  Jennifer crosses by them, carrying an armful of plastic wrappings and containers.
INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN - EVENING: Buffy stands at the sink, rinsing a glass for way too long, staring.  Her mother breezes THROUGH THE FRAME.
EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT: Pike drives slowly between the cars.  He sees Buffy walking toward the mall.  He pulls up by her, parks.  Gets out of the car.
INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT: Vampires are gathered around.  Lothos stands with Benny.  Benny is beaming.
INT. THE MALL - NIGHT: Buffy looks at dresses, most of them fairly tight and fairly out there.  She holds one in front of her, looks in a mirror.
INT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - ANOTHER NIGHT: Pike sits, fiddling with his crossbow.  Looks out the window, discontented.  Laid out next to him we see wooden shafts, garlic, and a cross.
INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT: Buffy lays her dress on the bed.  We cannot see exactly what it looks like. She stuffs some blood-stained clothes into a duffel bag along with some stakes.  She tosses the bag in the closet.
EXT. THE GYM - PROM NIGHT: Dozens of limos pull up.  Kids pour inside.
INT. THE GYM - NIGHT: The party is underway.  Streamers everywhere, tables by the windows.  Couples dance, a D.J spins the tunes.  There is a setup in one corner for taking prom pictures.  The kids are all very elegant and hip.  Every shade of black is represented.
ANGLE - PUNCH BOWL: Nicole and Kimberly stand by the punch bowl, chatting.  They are both wearing slinky little black dresses.
ANGLE - THE DOOR: There are two: at one end, leading to the house (it's closed) and one leading outside.  Gary Murray stands by the outside door, on guard, as students enter.  He is looking disdainfully at Andy and holding a flask he has confiscated.
BUFFY'S POV: Pike is there, walking in on his own.  He wears a leather jacket and baggy old tux pants, accented by chains, earring and unlaced Doc Martins.  He looks great. He walks directly toward Buffy, and does turn a few heads.
ANGLE - KIMBERLY: Sitting by the window with her bovine date, she watches Buffy dance disdainfully.
ANGLE - BUFFY AND PIKE: Looking around, assessing the situation.
ANGLE - OUTER DOOR: A STUDENT runs staggering in, blood spurting from his neck.
ANGLE - INSIDE THE PURSE: Cosmetics, hair spray, etc.  She fits the stakes in.
EXT. OUTSIDE THE GYM - NIGHT: We see the doorway to the gym.  A mist has risen around the entire house, swirling about the feet of the undead who stand clustered about it.  Some have keen and eager expressions, some vacant, half-conscious with bloodlust.  They wait. A figure appears in the doorway, walking slowly out.  Buffy. Her torn dress now comes to just above her knees.  She wears Pike's leather jacket over it.  She wears her purse strapped across her chest under the jacket.  In one hand she holds his crossbow; in her other hand is a cross.  As she steps further away from the doorway, the vampires slowly begin to close around her. The door shuts behind her.
INT. THE GYM - SAME TIME: Kimberly and some of the others are anxiously barricading the door.  Pike looks out the window after Buffy.
EXT. THE GYM - SAME TIME: The vampires move closer and closer.  They circle her.  She waits, apprehensive.  When they are about eight feet from her she whips out a bottle of Perrier.  She sprays it all around, searing the inner circle.  Screaming, they clutch their faces.
EXT. THE GYM - SAME TIME: Buffy is defending herself in an astounding blur of gymnastics and martial arts.  Leaping, throwing kicks, punches, and the odd stake, she manages to scatter them enough to make a run for it.
INT. THE GYM - SAME TIME: Everyone is watching through the windows as the vampires follow after Buffy.
EXT. THE GYM - SAME TIME: Almost as if it heard that, one of the vampires turns toward the gym, grinning hugely.  It and at least half the others turn back toward the easy pickings inside.
EXT. CAMPUS LAWN - SAME TIME: Buffy runs.  She heads toward the nearby cluster of school buildings.  Close behind are the undead.  She passes a line of parked cars.
ANGLE - CAR: Jeffrey and Jennifer are in the back of his parked BMW, making heated, clumsy love.  We can see them through the window.
INT. JEFFREY'S CAR - SAME TIME: Jeffrey looks up and out the window.
JEFFREY'S POV: Vampires swarm about the car in pursuit of Buffy. Jeffrey goes wide-eyed at the sight.  Starts climbing off Jennifer and into the driver's seat.
EXT. THE CAR - SAME TIME: The car roars off.
INT. THE GYM - SAME TIME: Windows and the boards covering them begin to smash inward.  A student pounding in nails is caught, pulled out the window.  A vampire crawling in is spiked by Pike.  Another makes it in and is smashed on the head repeatedly by Andy.  It staggers, smilingly, and turns toward him.
INT. TUNNELS - SAME TIME: A vampire catches up to Buffy.  She shoots the last crossbow shaft at it.  Shucks the bow away as another reaches her.  She wrestles with it, fights it off but doesn't kill it.  Moves on as more approach.
INT. THE GYM - SAME TIME: Students are still holding most of them at the windows.  One or two have gotten in.
ANGLE - THE RECORD PLAYER: A junior vampire has snuck behind it and is going through the records.  He stops, finding one he likes, and starts to put it on.  MUSIC: "Teen Angel".  It wafts over the carnage in the gym, lending it a surreal and dreamy quality. Hearing the music, another vampire grabs Kimberly and starts dancing with her.  She screams a lot. It's about to plant one on her neck when Pike stabs it in the back.  Pike turns from the dying vampire and is face to face with Benny. Pike is frozen for a moment.
EXT. OUTSIDE SCHOOL BUILDING - SAME TIME: Buffy approaches the nearest building to the gym.  The vampires are several feet behind her, some twenty of them. The door is locked.  She smashes it in with her shoulder. Runs inside. A few vampires are about to follow Buffy into the building when a hand is suddenly raised before them, stopping the. Slowly they start fading back. It is Amilyn.  He smiles at the other vampires, and raises his fingers to his lips. Shhhh....
INT. THE GYM - CLOSEUP ON A TABLE - SAME TIME: Pike is slammed down onto it, Benny's face inches from his. "Teen Angel" has been replaced by some hard rock.
ANGLE - ANOTHER WINDOW: Gary Murray, yelling orders at student, holding a board against a window as vampires pound on it.  The exposed part of the window above him shatters, raining glass on his head.
ANGLE - THE PHOTO SETUP: A vampire is clutching a helpless girl as another vampire takes their picture with an Instamatic.  He expresses confusion and dismay when his image does not come out in the photo.
ANGLE - PIKE AND BENNY: Pike is backing away from Benny, who is approaching him.  Pike passes an overturned table, the stubs of its broken legs sticking up at the ceiling.
ANGLE - KIMBERLY: Sitting by a wall, tiny and silent amid the carnage.
INT. HALL - SAME TIME: Buffy moves quickly along, crouching near a window and peering out.  Nothing.  She looks about her, waiting for an attack. She checks her purse.
ANGLE - BUFFY'S PURSE: Cosmetics and hair spray.  A small cross.  No stakes left. Muttering under her breath, she moves swiftly into a classroom.
INT. CLASSROOM - SAME TIME: Still moving cautiously, she heads for the window and pulls down the shade.  She crouches behind the teacher's desk and pulls the chair down to her, laying it on its side.
CLOSEUP - BUFFY: Looking out.  Amilyn's face appears right next to her, also looking out.
ANGLE - THE WINDOW SHADE: Buffy eyes the bottom of the shade, the pull dangling aimlessly.
INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - SAME TIME: The two of them fall through the ceiling directly into the blood pool. Amilyn's body surfaces first, now just a husk. Buffy pops up from the waist-deep blood, soaked and wounded. She stays a moment, breathing hard.  Suddenly her eyes go wide.
INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - THE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME: But he is on her the moment she emerges from the chamber, grabbing her by the hair and throwing her to the ground.
INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - SAME TIME: Lothos stumbles about, head all aflame, till he finally pitches into the pool.
INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - HALL - SAME TIME: Buffy comes out of the boiler room and hobbles along, moving as fast as she can.
INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - CLOSEUP ON LOTHOS - SAME TIME: As he pulls himself out of the pool, we are treated to a good look at his new head.  It is charred and torn almost beyond recognition.  It is so inhuman looking, that we are almost surprised when it screams!
INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - HALL - SAME TIME: The SCREAM fills the hall.  Buffy is still working on the heavy metal door.  She turns, wide-eyed, at the SOUND.
INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - LOTHOS' POV - SAME TIME: We TRACK rapidly through the cave, through the boiler room, the hall.  We're moving much too fast to be running.
INT. GYM - SAME TIME: Buffy pulls herself up through a trap door in the corner. Everything stops.  For a moment there is silence. Buffy gets shakily up.
ANGLE - PIKE: Kneeling by Andy's body.  He gets up, and walks toward what's left of Lothos, warily keeping his eye on the spot.  In the background we see Gary Murray, running out after a vampire.
EXT. THE SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING: We see the direct aftermath; the gym, police cars, people helping the wounded.  Over this is the voice of a reporter.
EXT. CAMPUS - DAY: Students walk, holding their books talking.
INT. THE CLASSROOMS - DAY: Students passing notes, yawning, falling asleep.
INT. THE MALL - DAY: Students window shopping, sucking on slurpies, laughing.
ANGLE - A POOL: SHOT FROM ABOVE, the blue water FILLING THE SCREEN.  Kimberly dives gracefully into it, comes up on the other side.
EXT. KIMBERLY'S BACKYARD - DAY: Kim climbs out and joins Jeffrey, Jennifer and a boy and girl we don't know.  They are all in bathing gear, with fluorescent zinc on their noses.
EXT. A COURTYARD - LATE EVENING: Buffy and Pike are walking up the elaborate stone drive toward us.  We can't really tell where they are, but there are trees, hills in the background. Buffy leads the way.  She is confident, at ease.  She wears a large old sports jacket, a baseball cap pulled backward.  Skirt and sneakers.  Casual, cool, but disarming.  She carries a knapsack.
ANGLE - DOOR KNOCKER: Buffy grabs the large metal knocker, ringed through a gargoyle's mouth. And on the boom of the knocker, we see:
WIDER ANGLE - THE CASTLE: The castle.  Archetypal, turreted, terrifying.  Standing lonely on the craggy hill, drenched in the light of the rising moon.
