DEAN: You know what we should do? We should leave her bowl full of water and her dish full of food. Because she's gotta get hungry and thirsty sometime. You know? Dean's optimism is infectious. Frankie nods slowly.
CINDY: I'm sleeping!
DEAN: We're hungry! We're going to eat you. They pin her arms above her head and 'furber' her armpit.
DEAN: What happened to the flute? Cindy pours the hot water into a bowl with instant oatmeal & raisins. She blows on the food and places it at the table.
CINDY: C'mon, eat, you can't be late today. Frankie takes a tiny bite and makes a sour face.
FRANKIE: I don't like it. Cindy turns on the faucet over a pile of dishes, returns to the computer to e-mail herself the missing dog flyer.
DEAN: Here. we can make it taste better. Dean spoons the raisins out of her bowl onto the table.
CINDY: Come on Frankie, use a spoon. You know how to use a spoon.
FRANKIE: Lepers don't use spoons.
FRANKIE: Okay, eat five bites. Dean gets up, goes to Cindy at the sink.

CINDY: Do you want to know the sex?
A11 A11: She drives through a drive through and orders fast food.
A12 A12: Cindy drives, fast food wrapper in hand, sees something out the window. She slows down, waits for opposing traffic to pass, then pulls a wide u-turn. She rises up out of her seat to look at something.
CINDY: Oh no. She pulls the car to a stop, puts on the hazzards, takes a moment to compose herself, unbuckles her seatbelt. Gets out. ELLIPSE: A blanket covers a dead Border Collie mutt in the gutter. Cindy puts Megan's body into the back of her van.
DEAN: Didn't think you were gonna make it.
CINDY: Did I miss her?
DEAN: Almost. Her class is coming up. Dean kisses her cheek. Cindy settles, arranges her things.
CINDY: It was alright. Busy.
DEAN: Anything good happen? Cindy shakes her head "no." She drops her keys into her purse, but they miss the target and she fumbles after them.
CINDY: I found Megan.
DEAN: That's great, where? Cindy doesn't answer. She can't. She tries to keep from crying. He quickly realizes what she's trying to tell him.
CINDY: Over on Urbandale. near Spur.
DEAN: I told you you gotta close that fucking Cindy wipes tears. She has to look up and blink to keep them from rolling down her cheek. Dean puts his arm around her, holds her close. She tries to pull away. He won't let her.
A13 A13: Cindy sits in her car, checking her eyes in the rear view mirror. They are puffy. Frankie runs full speed into Dean's arms. He picks her up and walks her to Cindy's car.
DEAN: You were great.
FRANKIE: Did you find Megan?
DEAN: No. But. I was thinking. Maybe she got a job or something. You know? So she could make some money and buy some food. Or maybe she moved out to Hollywood to become a movie dog! Frankie nods. Dean gets her to the car. Straps her in.
FRANKIE: Cindy listens in the front seat. She doesn't approve.
FRANKIE: Jerry growls at Frankie. She screams, scared but delighted. A yapping dog named SAMMY jumps on her. Jerry nods at Dean who keeps his distance by the van.
CINDY: Aren't you coming up? Dean gives a sour look and lights a cigarette.
DEAN: What? I can't smoke around his oxygen. Cindy gives Dean a slow look of contempt, grabs the backpack and walks toward the house. Jerry stands over the hose spigot with Frankie at his side.
JERRY: .Want me to show you a magic trick? Here's how you turn the grass green. You can teach it to your dad. The sprinkler jets on. Cindy comes up and kisses her dad on the cheek. She straightens Frankie's ears.
CINDY: Go say goodbye to Daddy. You're not going to see him until tomorrow. Jerry holds Frankie back.
JERRY: Wait.! OK.one, two, three GO! Frankie runs to Dean, dodging the water stream. She hugs his leg. He picks her up.
DEAN: Hey leopard. You be good now. You remember what to do when Pa snores?
FRANKIE: Cover his mouth and hold his nose.
DEAN: That's my girl. Gimme a squeezer. Dean hugs her and she squeezes back as hard as her arms allow. Dean plays as if his neck was being pinched off. He sets her on the ground running back to the porch. She gets caught in the diameter of the sprinkler spray. She screams as the water chases her.
JERRY: It got you! Go right! OTHER RIGHT! Dean and Cindy both laugh. Their eyes meet for the first time in days, maybe weeks. They exchange a brief smile, filled with mutual love, pride and respect - connected by their little girl. Frankie stands in front of Cindy, water drips from her bangs.
CINDY: Come on silly. Let's go in and get dry.
FRANKIE: I don't wanna take off my costume!

CURTIS: Whoa whoa. You gonna break your neck homey. Look down. Dean does. All he sees is brown box.
CURTIS: Gonna happen to you someday too.
CURTIS: I don't think that old man's been up here in 10 years. Saned elbows in with rolls of tape and contractor bags.

DEAN: Look how handsome he was.
SANED: What are you fucking queer? Saned hands Dean a wad of bills.
DEAN: Wait up. We gotta do this right. He takes the wheelchair from the nurse, wheels Walter out of the room, picks him out out of his wheelchair, and carries him back into the room across the threshold of his new home.
CURTIS: Boss says we gotta go. We gotta go. Dean cuts the tour short, wishes the old man luck and tells him he'll come visit him someday. He backs out of the doorway, grabs his money off the dresser, and says goodbye. Dean turns and is frozen in his tracks.

CINDY: She would have wanted to say goodbye. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 16.

DEAN: You're not going to decide? I'll decide. That's how decisions get made. Dean gets a shit-eating grin.
CINDY: Bobby Ontario?
BOBBY: .So, you been faithful to him?
CINDY: That's a strange question to ask someone you haven't seen in forever.
BOBBY: I'm a strange person. Cindy laughs.
CINDY: Yes you have or yes you haven't?
BOBBY: Yes you have or yes you haven't?
CINDY: Yes.I haven't. I mean I have.I have been.Why are you looking at me like I'm not looking at you like anything.

CINDY: She's good. Pause. They speak at the same time.
BOBBY: WHAT'S HER- SHE'S GOT-
CINDY: SHE'S GOT-
BOBBY: No, you go.
CINDY: Oh. I was going to say, you ask her what kind of hair she's got and she says, a bob. It's pretty funny.
BOBBY: What's her name?
CINDY: Fumbling, she starts bagging her groceries.
CHECKER: That's $58.42. Cindy hands the CHECKER a fifty. The Checker holds it out.
CINDY: Oh.I'm sorry. Cindy searches her wallet, goes into her change purse.

BOBBY: I got it.
CINDY: ( TO CHECKER )
BOBBY: You can get me back.
CINDY: Let's go.
DEAN: You're drivin'? Cindy hops in the driver's seat. Dean rides on the end of the buggy and crashes it into the buggy corral. She fires up the engine and honks. He throws his hands up.
DEAN: Alright, lead foot. It's not a race. Cindy is zoned into the road. She turns off the radio.
CINDY: Isn't it funny how you can be driving for 20 minutes and it feels like you've only been driving for 20 seconds. The time just gets swallowed up somewhere. Dean places his hand on Cindy's hand that rests on the car seat. A small squeeze. She squeezes back. Dean looks at her with tenderness. Her eyes are on the road. She lifts her hand to the wheel. Dean reaches for the radio.
DEAN: Do you mind if I turn this back on?
CINDY: I was kind of enjoying the silence.
DEAN: Let's just see if there's something on. He scans through the low stations.
CINDY: Think so.
DEAN: Where d'you get these? Dean reaches for the glasses on top of Cindy's head. She feels the dangling tag - "woops." She tears off the tag and tosses the glasses on the dashboard.

CINDY: I have to pee. The car stops on the shoulder of the two lane highway. Cindy gets out of the car.
DEAN: You can't wait? We're almost there.
CINDY: I gotta go. Cindy jogs across the road. Dean sees traffic coming.
DEAN: Goddamnit Cindy!! Pay attention!!! On the side of the road, she stares into the woods. Cars pass behind her, headlights flood the night. She descends into the thicket until the sound of the highway is faint. Wind through the leaves. She drops her pants and pees. Something rustles and she looks into the woods.
CINDY: She stands up and zips up her pants. Eyes search the shadows. .Cindy is ALONE. A leaf falls to earth. She stares at it and her mind drifts back to.
BOBBY: What are you doing?
CINDY: You're supposed to be a quadriplegic?

CINDY: Get down Napoleon! Get down! GLENDA HELLER - 50's, desperate - peeks her head out of the kitchen. She holds a coffee mug filled with gin on the rocks.
GLENDA: Ope - I thought you were your Dad.
CINDY: Just us. Cindy kisses her mom on the cheek, can smell the alcohol.
GLENDA: How was the beauty shop?
JERRY: Get that fucking dog out of the kitchen!
GRAMMA: Thank you. Glenda averts her eyes. She cuts another slice. Cindy offers Glenda her plate. The meat breaks apart and half of it lands on the table cloth. A brownish-green oil.
CINDY: It's OK mom.
GLENDA: Can I have your plate Dad? He pushes it across the table an inch. Glenda lowers a slice onto Jerry's plate with a SPLAT. Jerry looks at his dinner. Glenda serves herself. Cindy cuts Gramma's meat with her fork and looks over at her dad. His face is turning beat-red. Suddenly, Jerry pounds his fist into the mound of meatloaf, obliterating it. Particles of ground meat fly everywhere. Glenda won't look up, her shoulders tremble. Jerry raises his steaming fist. Bits of ground beef stick to his knuckles.
JERRY: What'd you do to meatloaf? Huh?!
GLENDA: They had it ready-made in the deli. I. thought it looked good.
JERRY: Are you kidding me? How long does it take to make a meatloaf? Five minutes? You mean to tell me that you didn't have five minutes to make a meatloaf? I been up since six this morning busting my fucking ass and you don't have five minutes to make a meatloaf?
GLENDA: I thought it would be nice.
JERRY: .for a change.
GLENDA: .for a change.
JERRY: Well, what gave you the idea that any of us needed a change? Did you ask for a change? Cindy? She doesn't ask for anything. She doesn't talk. You didn't ask for a change, did you mom?.She can't hear! And I don't remember asking for a change. So, it was you, wasn't it? You wanted a change. I work all day so you can sit on your fat ass, thinkin' about yourself. How you'd like a change.
GLENDA: Sorry? What good is sorry now?
JERRY: Sorry? What good is sorry now?
GLENDA: Do you want me to make you some eggs?
JERRY: I want you to enjoy your fucking dinner. He storms out of the dining room. Glenda, Cindy and Gramma sit in silence. Cindy takes a bite.
CINDY: It's not bad.
GLENDA: Oh bullshit. Glenda retreats into the kitchen. Gramma and Cindy eat.
GRAMMA FRANCIS: Don't get my hair.
BOBBY: I couldn't help it. She gets out from underneath him.
BOBBY: It's your fault. You felt too good. She sees her underwear lying by the base of the bed. She goes to grab them, but Bobby snatches them away.
CINDY: Give em! Cindy presses her lips together. She leaps at Bobby and squeezes his crotch and gets her underwear back. Bobby's face turns vicious. He snatches them back aggressively.
BOBBY: Say you're sorry! Cindy picks her pants up off the floor - pulls them on.
CINDY: Take a deep whiff, you fucking douchebag! She tears off his necklace, throws it at him, slams the door.
BOBBY: I was just joking! God!

DEAN: Wow. Where are we? He sets down the suitcases, transfixed by the room, a kid in a candy shop. Cindy moves to the small kitchen that looks like a control room. She makes herself a drink.
DEAN: Now watch. He runs his hands through his hair then shows her his palms - three fallen hairs. His magic trick.
CINDY: Did Pa make you something to eat yet? .Frankie? .What'd you and Pa eat? .Was it cooked all the way through? No pink in there? . Dean walks up from behind, putting on a clean, white T-shirt. He snaps his fingers at Cindy. Cindy swipes his hand away with more force than necessary.
DEAN: Are you ready to go to sleep now? I'll call you first thing in the morning, OK? He walks into the living room, stretching the phone cord, grabs the remote and turns on the television - animal doc. Dean turns the channel. Tennis.

CINDY: Close the door! Dean closes the door, remains in the BATHROOM, watches his naked wife, removes his clothes. Cindy does a double take.
DEAN: What does it look like I'm doing?
CINDY: The small shower presses them close. Dean's smile infects her. He leans over, they kiss. Brushing lips at first. Dean presses closer. Cindy pulls back and pivots him around until the stream of water catches his body. He leans his head back, the water pours over his hair and face. He places his hands on Cindy's hips and pulls her close to him. Cindy hands him a bar of soap. He builds a gentle lather. Cindy inches back, turns around. Dean lathers her back, slow and languid.

DEAN: He lowers his hands from her back to her behind. Cindy turns.
CINDY: Cindy grabs under his armpits. He refuses, but she wins. She pivots them around again. Standing in the stream of water, Cindy washes the soap off her body, eyes closed, head back. Dean reaches for her and follows with his fingertips the flow of water down the front of her body.
DEAN: Getting thinner, isn't it?
CINDY: Your hair is not falling out. Cindy pivots him around into the water and rinses him.
DEAN: I know. I love you. She pecks him on the lips.
CINDY: Okay, get out. I have to finish washing I'll do it.
DEAN: I'll do it.

DEAN: Naw. She's the champ. She's the best parts of you and the best parts of me put together. Everyday she gets more and more Dean chews a bite of meat and washes it down with a shot of vodka. He refills both their glasses.
CINDY: Daddy's little girl.
DEAN: She's not mine. I'm hers.
CINDY: That's beautiful.
DEAN: It's the choice I made when she was born. Silence. They chew. Cindy stares through Dean.
CINDY: Why don't you do something.
DEAN: Like what?
CINDY: I don't know. isn't there anything you want to do? Dean thinks about it. Shakes his head.
DEAN: What am I supposed to want to do?
CINDY: I don't know. You have so many things you could do. You're good at everything. You could do anything you wanted.
DEAN: I just wanna be with you. Silence. Cindy tries not to look disappointed.
CINDY: Like right before the bear eats the man?
DEAN: Yeah. You do. It's true. That's what you look like. Dean is amused but fearful. Cindy's confidence surges.
CINDY: How different we are. You and me.
DEAN: It's a good thing.
CINDY: It's a good thing.
DEAN: You think that's good that we're Absolutely. We don't have to get in each other's way.
CINDY: Absolutely. We don't have to get in each other's way.
DEAN: And that's the way you like it, don't you? You don't like me to bother you.
CINDY: I didn't say that. What I meant is that it's important for us to have our space. That's all. We're grown people.
DEAN: Well there's not much space here. So I guess you won't be able to get away from me will ya?
CINDY: You know, we rarely sit down and have a conversation. An adult conversation. Because every time we do, you turn something that I say around and make it mean something that I didn't mean to say. You just blab. Blab.
DEAN: If you're not interested in hearing what I think I just won't say anything.
CINDY: Good luck. I just want you to think about what you say sometimes instead of saying what you think all the time.
DEAN: OK. I'm going to say something. And what I'm about to say I've thought long and hard about. I'm the luckiest person alive because I'm living my dream - you, her, this, us, all of it. Cindy lifts up her empty wine glass to the light.
CINDY: I think my glass has a hole in it. Cindy cuts around her food and pushes a piece aside.
DEAN: What's wrong with that?
CINDY: It's fat.
DEAN: That's the flavor. Eat it.
CINDY: I don't want to. You eat it. Dean stabs a piece of fat and pops it into his mouth.
DEAN: My tits? I got tits? Dean opens his shirt and peers down at his chest.
CINDY: Shiiit. I bet you a nickel you can't even beat me at arm wrestling.
DEAN: A dime and you're on. Cindy gulps more champagne. They scoot dishes out of the way and clasp hands in the middle of the table.
CINDY: I'm always ready, baby.
DEAN: I'm always ready, baby.
CINDY: On the count of three. One. Two. Cindy flexes and starts.
THREE!: Dean, acting as if he isn't trying at all, holds Cindy's hand at a stand still.
DEAN: Come on. Go! Start. Cindy ignores his taunts and pushes as hard as she can. Slowly, she begins to push Dean's hand down. Dean groans, letting her win a little. Cindy presses down with all her weight. His hand is centimeters from hitting the table. Then, he turns the tide. Cindy battles back with all the strength she can muster. Dean laughs, realizing her passion for victory. Dean pounds her hand into the table. He stands kisses his flexed bicep. Cindy lifts her hand. A fork is stuck in the back of it. She looks at it with curiosity.
CINDY: I'm alright.
DEAN: Hold still. He plucks the fork from her hand, leaving four vampire bites.
CINDY: Ow ow ow. Dean leads her to the kitchen, holds her hand under the You think we should rush you to the hospital before you bleed to death? Cindy shoots him a look. Dean wraps her hand with a dishrag.
DEAN: You think we should rush you to the hospital before you bleed to death? Cindy shoots him a look. Dean wraps her hand with a dishrag.
CINDY: It stings a little. Dean tries to pick up Cindy. She struggles against it. Finally he cradles her like a squirming baby.
DEAN: Wait wait wait. He flicks the switch and the bed starts spinning. He runs out of the room. Cindy watches the room around her spin. Dean returns with the vodka bottle and two shot glasses. He kneels above her and pours them two shots.
CINDY: I'm spinning. She sits up. They toast. Dean gulps his. Cindy takes a sip.
DEAN: Drink up. We haven't gotten loaded together in years. He tops off her glass, refills his own, and quaffs it.
CINDY: What are you doing in there? .Dean?! An agonizing moan comes from down the hall. Cindy staggers off the spinning bed and stumbles to the bathroom door.
CINDY: Ew. Come on, get up.
DEAN: Nope, I want you to come here first. I want you to laugh. Cindy opens the door and Dean scoots, making room for her. He lets out an "ow" before extending his hand.
CINDY: Not being retarded. Cindy looks down.
DEAN: Not being retarded. Cindy looks down.
CINDY: Dean. Come on, it's time for bed.
DEAN: No I want to make you laugh. Tears well up in her eyes. Dean rolls on top of her. He cups her face in his hands and stares long into her watery eyes.
CINDY: You're drunk.
DEAN: No, I'm just still in love with you. After a moment, their lips meet in an awkward rejuvenation. She moves her head away and pats Dean on the shoulder in a gesture of friendship. Dean kisses her neck.
CINDY: No. Dean. Wait a second. She removes his hand and places it on her hip. Dean continues to kiss her neck. He slides his hand up to her breasts. Cindy turns her head in the other direction. She pushes his hand away. He brings it back aggressive. Again. Cindy squirms underneath him. He grabs her wrists and holds her arms over her head. His tongue licks Cindy from her breasts to her face. She worms her arms away and grabs onto his hair. She arches her back, looks at him through slit eyes. His pelvis pulses and he moans. He looks up at her over his brow into her desperate eyes. He springs up. Sweat beads on his What!? I can't have sex with my wife!? Cindy covers her face with her hand.
DEAN: What!? I can't have sex with my wife!? Cindy covers her face with her hand.
CINDY: Stop. stop. stop.
DEAN: Is that what you think you deserve? Would that make it easier on you so you can treat me like this? Cindy raises her hips and slips off her panties. She lifts the shirt up over her head, positions her feet on the door jam. Her arm falls over her eyes. Breathless, Dean awkwardly moves one hand up and down her bodice.
CINDY: Are my hands cold?
DEAN: ( CONTINUED )
CINDY: You wanna go somewhere.
DEAN: Where can we go?
CINDY: Where can we go?
CINDY: You think he's gonna go to sleep now? They hear Jake changing channels in the other room. As quietly as possible, they have sex under the sheet.
CINDY: Just a second. She wraps the test in toilet paper and buries it in the trash receptacle. A moment while the door swings closed. Silence. Cindy opens the stall and confronts herself in the mirror.
CINDY: Give it back! Bobby crushes the card in his fist. She tries to pry it open. She can't. She's not gonna get it back.
DEAN: Are you okay? Cindy nods.
DEAN: Is it mine? Cindy looks Dean in the eyes.
CINDY: I. I don't know. It might be.
DEAN: You let that asshole knock you up?
CINDY: .I'm sorry.I'm sorry.
DEAN: When'd this happen?
CINDY: Before us.
DEAN: What do you want to do?
CINDY: I don't know.
DEAN: ( after a pause ) We'll keep it. We'll take care of it. Cindy nods. Silence.
CINDY: It's not the right time. Dean looks down, pauses and looks back to Cindy.
DEAN: Do you want to take care of it?
DOCTOR: You can put your clothes on the chair.
CINDY: The DOCTOR wheels over to the table in the center of the room. She pulls out a clean sheet of examination table paper.
DOCTOR: I'm going to have you lie up here, and put your feet in the stirrups. Cindy gets on the table, looks over at a tray of instruments. The Doctor pulls a mask up over her face - the vacuum aspirator on a wheeled base. Cindy focuses her gaze at the corrugated ceiling, dim light.
CINDY: The Doctor touches Cindy's knee to spread her legs, picks up an instrument off the table.
DOCTOR: I want you to try and relax. This is going to be a little cold. The Doctor inserts a speculum into Cindy's vagina.
CINDY: I'm a student.
DOCTOR: What are you studying? The Doctor dips a long swab into a solution, inserts it into her vagina.
CINDY: I'm studying to be a DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: That's what I studied.
CINDY: What's that?
DOCTOR: This is a mild anesthetic for your cervix. You're going to feel a pinch and then it's going to feel like electricity. Cindy looks back up at the ceiling. She steady's her breath.
CINDY: Because. I always thought. it would be wonderful to take a sick child and. Cindy cuts herself off. The Doctor holds a hose.
DOCTOR: And what?
CINDY: .heal them.
DOCTOR: Cindy, I'm going to begin the procedure. It won't take long. You may feel a little The Doctor turns on the vacuum. Panic flushes Cindy's face. Her eyes widen.
CINDY: Wait. wait.
DEAN: You're not in this alone. This baby is ours. It's us. Let's start a family.
CINDY: Your eyes ever wide open, and you're Cindy breathes deep & settles into him. Dean hums a lullaby.
CINDY: She drops it and rolls over. The digital clock reads 4:52. Moments later. she is on the phone. CINDY ( on phone ) ( cont'd ) Hi it's Cindy. I have this weekend off. Cindy unwraps the bandage on her hand. She presses the four vampire bites to her lips.
CINDY: No response. She closes the door behind her.
DEAN: No response. He struggles up and stumbles to the phone.
MESSAGE: Good morning. This is your.11:30 a.m.wake up call.
DEAN: ( CONTINUED )
DEAN: Was she with a guy?
CONCIERGE: Like I said, I couldn't say. I just got here, so maybe she left before I came in. He types on the computer.
AMANDA: You want some of this? Dean accepts the pipe and takes a monster toke, holding it in until his face turns purple.
BOBBY: Hey faggot! Dean continues his work.
DEAN: Who's askin'? Bobby rushes him, throws a shoulder into his stomach. They both flail to the floor. The two lock. Everything is quick. Bobby sends a flurry of punches to Dean's ribs and guts. Dean pummels the back of Bobby's head with blind overhead rights. It becomes clear that Bobby has the upper hand. He holds Dean's bloodied head in some kind of jiujitsu headlock.
BOBBY: Think I'm dumb? Think I'm that dumb? Dean struggles to breathe but manages to say.
DEAN: I think you're a fucking idiot. Bobby hits him again, harder. Harder.
BOBBY: Fucking faggot! - Troy and Tony watch the door and egg Bobby on. - THE PHONE RINGS OFF THE HOOK in the EMPTY OFFICE.
BOBBY: Stay away from her!
DEAN: Bobby looks at his bloodied hands. He lacks the strength to lift he arms. Gives one last weak kick into Dean's bloodied face. Troy and Tony pull Bobby out. The gang leaves, victorious yet somehow defeated. The office phone, which has been ringing incessantly, stops. Dean is on the floor in the fetal position. It takes him a while, but he manages to sit up. He feels the inside of his split lip with his tongue. He doesn't feel pain as much as he feels tingling and ringing - all over. Jo comes in. She freezes when she sees him.
JO: Dean. Telephone. It takes Dean a while to get up, but he does. And it takes him a while to get to the office where his phone call awaits. Once there, he holds the receiver in his hand for a beat.
DEAN: INT. CLINIC - WAITING ROOM - DAY - PRESENT DAY Cindy wearing scrubs, picks up the ringing phone.
CINDY: Mediplex. You are going to need to come in. We're going to need to see him. I can't diagnose over the phone. About 20- 30 minutes. Okay? .okay, bye. Cindy hangs up. She holds a clipboard. CINDY ( reading ) ( cont'd ) A Hispanic women, MARIA GUEVARA - robust, 50's - clutches her purse and rises off a waiting area chair. Cindy smiles.
CINDY: Have a seat on the table, Mrs. Guevara. Maria has a blank look.
MARIA: Yo tabien. De donde eres tu?
CINDY: Yo tabien. De donde eres tu?
MARIA: Yo tabien. De donde eres tu?
CINDY: Yo tabien. De donde eres tu?
MARIA: El Salvador.
CINDY: So.Tu famalia esta aqui? Here?
MARIA: No no.
CINDY: They're in El Salvador?
MARIA: Si..Yo.sola. How you say en Ingles? Si. Alone.
CINDY: Si. Alone.
MARIA: Si. Alone.
CINDY: But hopefully not lonely. Maria hides her face with her hand and lets out a self- pitying giggle. Cindy looks at her clipboard.
MARIA: Si Si.
CINDY: Well let's take a look. Cindy hands her a paper robe.
DR. FEINBERG: Busy. Haven't sat down yet. Walk with me. Cindy's holds her clipboard to her chest. He tilts it down with his finger. DR. FEINBERG ( cont'd ) What do you have?
CINDY: A woman in 215. Hispanic. 53. Lives alone. Complaining of pain in her left DR. FEINBERG Uh huh. I'll be in in a minute. By the way, I was thinking about you.
DR. FEINBERG: Uh huh. I'll be in in a minute. By the way, I was thinking about you.
CINDY: Oh yeah?
DR. FEINBERG: Yeah, well I can understand how you might not be able to relocate your whole family up to Riverdale, with your daughter being in school and everything. But, I was thinking, maybe, you could get an apartment. Work during the week, drive down on weekends. They arrive at a door, Room 220.
CINDY: I'm married.
DR. FEINBERG: It's not a proposition, I'm just trying to help.
CINDY: I don't remember asking you for help. He holds up his hands and leaves Cindy alone in the hallway. She looks at the ground, turns around and walks to Room 215.
CINDY: What's the problem, Maria? Tu sabes? Cindy pantomimes undoing her shirt.
DR. FEINBERG: Cindy. What's going on here? Cindy points to Maria.
CINDY: Her breast. Her breast! Dr. Feinberg takes Cindy's clipboard from her hands.
DR. FEINBERG: I can take over from here. He talks to Maria calm and clear. DR. FEINBERG ( cont'd ) Hello Mrs. Guevara. I'm Dr. Feinberg. I'm your DOCTOR. Let me see. It's OK. He reaches for the trembling Maria's blouse. Maria flinches.
CINDY: It's probably been growing for years! Dr. Feinberg turns to Cindy.
DR. FEINBERG: He turns back to Maria and places his hand on her shoulder. DR. FEINBERG ( cont'd ) It's going to be alright, Mrs. Guevara. Cindy backs out of the room. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 74.
MIMI: ( ON PHONE )
DEAN: Where's my wife? She hands him an in-patient form. Dean looks at it.
MIMI: You need to fill that out, sir. You can go over there. Mimi returns to the phone.
DEAN: There's nothing wrong with me. Dean hands her back the clipboard.
MIMI: No, you need to fill it out, sir. Bring it back up to me when you're done.
DEAN: Where's my wife? Mimi lowers the phone.
MIMI: Who's your wife?
DEAN: Cynthia. Where is she?
MIMI: Are you Dean?
DEAN: Yeah, are you deaf or are you just dumb? She puts the phone on hold and disappears into the clinic. Dean turns around and looks at the people in the waiting room. He has a slight confrontation with a gang banger. Cindy approaches from the hallway.
CINDY: DEAN ( TURNS )
CINDY: I can see that. How'd you get here?
DEAN: I got a ride. Mimi appears behind Cindy.
CINDY: Frankie's fine. Dean nods. He looks over Cindy's shoulder at Mimi.
DEAN: Taking pictures? Mimi sits down at her desk and picks up a ringing phone.
CINDY: We're not going to do this here. Cindy crosses the counter, grabs the bags by Dean's feet. CINDY ( to Mimi ) ( cont'd ) Give me a few minutes.
MIMI: I'll be right here. Don't let him brainwash you again.
CINDY: Live your life. Cindy walks out of the clinic hefting her bags.
DEAN: Last night got fucked up, OK? I know it. I know I'm lazy, I eat too much, I drink too much, I drive you crazy with all my jealous bullshit. I fuck up. I know I'm clumsy. But you're not trying anymore. Cindy hurls the bags into the back of the car. Dean helps.
CINDY: Are you drunk?
DEAN: I'm OK.
CINDY: Can you drive?
DEAN: Yeah. Let's go.
CINDY: No, you go. Take the car home. She hands him the keys.
DEAN: You don't think about anyone but yourself. Do you? Cindy walks back to the clinic. Dean follows close behind.
CINDY: You know how many sacrifices I make every You! What about me? I gave up everything for you.
DEAN: You! What about me? I gave up everything for you.
CINDY: I never asked you to! I can't take this shit anymore. Cindy enters through the electric doors.
DEAN: Take what? What can't you take. The truth? I know you can't. You never You're right Dean, I can't take the truth.I've had it with the truth or whatever it is you make up along the way and label as truth. You win. I give up. I've been lying to you for a long Who is it?
CINDY: You're right Dean, I can't take the truth.I've had it with the truth or whatever it is you make up along the way and label as truth. You win. I give up. I've been lying to you for a long Who is it?
DEAN: Who is it?
CINDY: It's me, Dean. I didn't want to hurt you. But I'm not the person you fell in love with. And you won't let me be anything but that person. That's why I can't look at you. Because every time I do I can't stop thinking about how much I want you to hate me. But you're too stupid to see it, and too chicken shit to do anything about it.
DEAN: Wait a second. He grabs her in a hug. Her arms are pressed into her side.
CINDY: I don't love you anymore. Why can't you stop loving me? He pulls back his fist and swings, hitting the metal locker behind Cindy's head. He repeats the blows with thunderous rage. Feinberg enters the room.
FEINBERG: What the hell is going on!? Dean turns and takes a blind swing at Feinberg. One blow and Feinberg reels against the metal lockers. He hits the ground with a thud. His nose gushes blood. Dean paces around Feinberg like a caged animal. He pulls down a locker with his hand. It crashes to the floor. Cindy kneels over Feinberg.
CINDY: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let me see.
FEINBERG: You're done. Leave. Dean jerks Cindy up off the floor.
DEAN: Get up. She hits Dean with a flurry of flailing fists.
CINDY: You son of a bitch! Punches catch him in the nose. Cindy bullies Dean backwards with repeated shoves to the chest. He backs up down the hallway. Mimi stands in the hallway.
MIMI: Oh my god. Call 911. I'm going to call
CINDY: Give me the keys.
DEAN: I know! He grabs the suitcase next to him and opens the door. He throws it through the air into a FIELD - trying rid himself of pain, longing, and desperation. He clutches his wedding ring, but can't yank it off of his fat finger. Finally, he gets it off and tosses it into the field. The moment he releases it, he wishes he hadn't. MOMENTS LATER - Dean and Cindy search for the ring. It is lost. Music begins to play in reverse.
DEAN: I didn't know if it was pot luck so I brought an eggplant. He points at his face. Behind Jerry, Cindy peeks out from the kitchen at the end of the hallway. It is the first time she has seen Dean since the fight. She is shocked.
CINDY: Oh God. Cindy squeezes by her father to Dean. The expression on her face says it all. Dean hands her the flowers, leans in and kisses her. While he's there he whispers.
DEAN: I stole these for you.
CINDY: Are you okay? Dean nods. She leads him down the hall. Jerry stops, turns. JERRY ( to Cindy ) Tell him to take off his shoes. Dean removes his boots. A toe wiggles out of a holey sock. He gathers the hole and tucks it between his big toe and his second toe. Cindy leads him by the hand to the kitchen.
CINDY: Does that hurt.
DEAN: No. It feels good. Keep doing it. She does and is interrupted by. The FAINT SOUND of her parents fighting downstairs.
DEAN: Maybe I should go.
CINDY: Why? They'll stop soon.
DEAN: I'm going to miss my train.
CINDY: Cindy goes over to her stereo and turns on some music, low - it is the same song that Dean and Cindy listened to in the moon room. It drowns out some of the fighting. She approaches him, starts unbuttoning his shirt.
DEAN: She kisses him. Opens up his shirt. Reveals a severely bruised torso. He winces a bit from the movement. She redresses his wounds, nursing him back to health.
CINDY: That motherfucker. She kisses his chest. Dean starts getting underneath Cindy's clothes. He places his palm on her belly.
DEAN: I love you.
CINDY: I love you too.
DEAN: From here on out, their actions increase with urgency. Each moment that goes by makes them more and more desperate to feel the other's skin. They are down to their underwear when they hear a door slam downstairs.
CINDY: From here on out, their actions increase with urgency. Each moment that goes by makes them more and more desperate to feel the other's skin. They are down to their underwear when they hear a door slam downstairs.
DEAN: Are your parent's gonna walk in on us?
CINDY: They never come in here. They make sweet love.
FRANKIE: Daddy! Daddy! Mommy! Cindy's car sits in the driveway. Cindy gets out, grabs her suitcase. Jerry emerges from the house. Cindy kneels down and hugs Frankie. She is electricity in her arms.
CINDY: Who had candy for breakfast?
DEAN: Hey sweetheart. Frankie leaps into Dean's arms. Cindy walks up to the house.
CINDY: How was Frankie?
JERRY: She was good. Are you OK?
CINDY: I'm OK. Cindy kisses her father on the cheek, closes the screen door. DEAN ( holding Frankie ) I can't play right now, okay? He releases his wired daughter who runs circles around him. Dean walks up to the porch. He and Jerry stand face to face.
JERRY: I don't know what happened up there. But please Dean, come on. Don't push it. Let it be. Dean closes the screen door behind him and locks it. Jerry pulls on the door.
DEAN: Keep an eye on Francis.
JERRY: I don't have my oxygen! Hey! Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 84.
CINDY: I'm not coming home. Fear strikes Dean. He presses the base of his palms into his eyes, rubbing until he sees stars.
DEAN: We're not alone here Cynthia. We have a little girl. We need to think about her.
CINDY: I am thinking about her.
DEAN: All you're thinking about is yourself. You. Francis is gonna grow up in a broken home and that's OK with you.
CINDY: I can't let her grow up in a home where her parents don't love each other.
DEAN: Don't love each other? I've only ever loved you. Dean approaches her from behind. Reaches out.
DEAN: He holds her hands and gropes her arms, legs, shoulders whatever she will let him touch. Cindy has tears in her eyes but she is focused. There is nothing to say.
FRANKIE: I want to stay at Grampa's house next time for fifty nights. Dean looks up. He has tears in his eyes. Frankie touches one as it streams down his face.
DEAN: Thank you.
FRANKIE: Dean walks out the front door where he passes Jerry who stands on the porch. He moves across the lawn to the sidewalk. Vermillion light falls in the sky. Cindy sets Frankie down and she runs out the door. Jerry catches the little girl by the arm and holds her tight. Dean walks toward the horizon. FRANKIE ( SCREAMS ) ( cont'd ) Dean stops and turns. Cindy walks to the porch.
CINDY: Let her go, Dad. Jerry releases her and Frankie runs fast to Dean. She jumps at him to go into his arms. He doesn't pick her up. From the porch Cindy and Jerry watch Dean as he points to them. Frankie doesn't move. Dean yells for her to go back. Frankie heads back to her mother, confused. Cindy kneels down and takes her in her arms. Families light fireworks off in the middle of the streets.
JUSTICE: . you may now kiss the bride. Dean and Cindy kiss. We hold on the kiss for as long as it takes. They stop kissing and look at each other in the eyes. Then, they start to hug. And hug. and hug. The title BLUE VALENTINE superimposes on top of the image. Credits start to scroll over.
