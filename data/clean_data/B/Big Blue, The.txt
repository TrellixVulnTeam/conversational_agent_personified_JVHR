UNDERWATER: JACQUES touches bottom. Clamps his legs around a rock to hold himself down. Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet under. he opens the plastic bag. A huge speckled moray eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him. The carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head. The boy smiles at him. Pulls a piece of raw meat out of his bag and holds it out. The eel takes the morsel delicately and slithers back into his hole. Gravely, JACQUES takes another morsel out of the bag.
THE BOYS: Jacques! Come quick!
BOYS: Look! Right there! It's shining! JACQUES walks over, and sure enough sees something shining a few feet down in the water.
JACQUES: ( squinting ) A coin.
FIRST BOY: I found it.
SECOND BOY: Camera pans and we see a middle-aged PRIEST loading supplies into a small boat. He stops to watch the children's negotiations. Little JACQUES is putting his flippers on.
JACQUES: Ok. I'll get it, but no fighting, all right? The two boys nod as they point to the coin.
JACQUES: We'll split it.
FIRST BOY: You can't split a coin. That's He's right. You're stupid. The pope smiles.
SECOND BOY: He's right. You're stupid. The pope smiles.
JACQUES: Then we'll buy something and split A helicopter.
SECOND BOY: A helicopter.
JACQUES: It's a small coin.
FIRST BOY: A Ferrari.
SECOND BOY: I don't want a Ferrari. What is Maybe a little radio. The two boys look at each other.
JACQUES: ( interrupting them ) Maybe a little radio. The two boys look at each other.
JACQUES: Well. We'll decide later. The light is going.
SECOND BOY: I get the radio from after school, until midnight.
FIRST BOY: Since when do you stay up until All right, all right. Can I concentrate? And you can stop pointing. I've seen it.
JACQUES: All right, all right. Can I concentrate? And you can stop pointing. I've seen it.
FIRST BOY: ( annoyed ) Shit, it's the Italian! He is slightly older than JACQUES but he is taller. ENZO is with ROBERTO, his younger brother, the only one allowed to carry his flippers. Five kids are behind him.
ENZO: Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman! How is the little ENZO pats JACQUES on the shoulder and leaves his hand there a lightly intimidating gesture.
JACQUES: ( cool ) ENZO pats JACQUES on the shoulder and leaves his hand there a lightly intimidating gesture.
ENZO: You don't mind if I go instead, do If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you? ENZO pats his shoulder reassuringly.
JACQUES: ( intimidated, and If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you? ENZO pats his shoulder reassuringly.
ENZO: If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you? ENZO pats his shoulder reassuringly.
ENZO: ( to his brother ) Roberto, mio palmo! ROBERTO who has already started to moisten his big brother's gear in the water, holds a pair of dripping flippers and a glistening mask. The pope watches the scene with obvious pleasure.
ENZO: ( to his brother on Sure of himself, ENZO takes a deep breath and dives in the water. ROBERTO counts out loud.
ROBERTO: 1. 2. 3. The kids all walk over to the edge of the pier. A few feet away, JACQUES takes off his flippers.
ROBERTO: 4. 5. 6. ENZO bursts out of the water, the coin in his hand. The children cheer and clap. ROBERTO rushes to catch the equipment that comes flying at him, piece by piece. ENZO walks over to JACQUES.
ENZO: ( showing him the Who's is it now? You saw it but I dove for it! JACQUES doesn't answer. ENZO smiles and slowly puts the coin in his pocket. He pulls it out again and waves it under JACQUES' nose.
ENZO: ( without turning Roberto? How long?
ROBERTO: Six seconds. ENZO looks at JACQUES for a while.
ENZO: I'll throw it back into the water. You dive and if you do less than six, it's yours. JACQUES doesn't say anything, then finally shakes his head, negatively. ENZO smiles, taps him on the shoulder.
ENZO: The first boy finally sums up his courage to speak.
BOY: ( timidly ) Enzo? I saw the coin first. We ( smiling ) You can't split a coin, stupid. ENZO laughing, sticks the coin in his pocket and leaves the pier with his gang. The pope smiles and pulls a coin from his pocket. With his flippers dangling from one hand, JACQUES sadly stares out at the sea. The pope calls him over.
ENZO: ( smiling ) You can't split a coin, stupid. ENZO laughing, sticks the coin in his pocket and leaves the pier with his gang. The pope smiles and pulls a coin from his pocket. With his flippers dangling from one hand, JACQUES sadly stares out at the sea. The pope calls him over.
PRIEST: Jacques. Come, look. JACQUES goes over to him, sees where he is pointing, the faint gleam of the coin underwater.
PRIEST: Is it a coin shining down there?
JACQUES: ( overjoyed ) It is. It's a coin! I'll get it for you, Father!
PRIEST: It'll be for the poor. JACQUES, intent on the coin's glimmer, quickly slips on his fins, prepares his mask. He swims in the water like a fish, goes directly to the coin. Scoops it up, brings it to the surface. He breaks water, waves the coin, looks for the priest and sees he is no longer there.
JACQUES: He looks at the ancient impression on the coin "Boy on a Dolphin".
FATHER: ( with a smile ) . Come on, time to get up, JACQUES rubs his eyes. His father walks over to a pile of blankets on the floor, on the other side of the room. He gives the pile a kick.
FATHER: ( screaming at the Louis, wake up! He uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl of soup for Jacques. A fifty year old man pokes his head out from under the pile of blankets. It's UNCLE LOUIS, who is having a very hard time, waking up.
FATHER: Jacques, come help me. JACQUES helps his father into the diver's suit. The burly man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes. He seems sluggish and tired. JACQUES watches worriedly. He has a weird feeling.
JACQUES: You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
UNCLE LOUIS: Then you shouldn't eat everyday, His father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck.
FATHER: ( winks at him ) Don't worry. When I'm tired down there, the mermaids help me out. Father and son smile at each other. Then his father puts the helmet on. JACQUES joins LOUIS at the pump. The heavy diver's suit disappears slowly underwater. The gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of JACQUES and LOUIS work the pump. Regular, steady motions to maintain the flow of air.
UNCLE LOUIS: ( to Jacques ) Hey! Have you ever seen a mermaid?
JACQUES: They keep on pumping for a while, then.
UNCLE LOUIS: I've seen them. UNCLE LOUIS goes on. JACQUES doesn't budge.
UNCLE LOUIS: Don't you want to know where? JACQUES looks at the bottom to watch his father. He doesn't answer.
UNCLE LOUIS: Why don't you ask me?
JACQUES: UNCLE LOUIS Where I saw the mermaids?! Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question! We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit! JACQUES calmly looks over at him, slows down his pumping and almost serenely asks him:
UNCLE LOUIS: Where I saw the mermaids?! Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question! We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit! JACQUES calmly looks over at him, slows down his pumping and almost serenely asks him:
JACQUES: ( in a completely Why did my mother leave? UNCLE LOUIS seems disturbed by the question. A beat.
UNCLE LOUIS: ( ill at ease ) Come on now, pump!
UNCLE LOUIS: Your mother didn't leave. She went back to America, that's all. It's her home. She's allergic to this Island. She likes refrigerators and machines that clean the floor. so one day she left. Woman are like that, unpredictable, like the sea. They haven't been paying attention to the bubbles gushing at the surface. The air hose is being pulled down in a very worrisome way.
JACQUES: ( with a slight grin ) So where did you see mermaids? UNCLE LOUIS smiles.
UNCLE LOUIS: In the bars in Athens! Very pleased with himself, UNCLE LOUIS burst out laughing. JACQUES shyly shrugs his shoulders. The air hose is suddenly yanked down. JACQUES immediately sees all the bubbles. He is white as a sheet. JACQUES rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling down at his father. He grabs the life line and starts pulling at it hysterically. The air hose snaps and starts flying around like some crazy snake. JACQUES tries to jump overboard. UNCLE LOUIS catches hold of his foot at the last second. JACQUES is slapping the water with his hands, trying to go down but UNCLE LOUIS won't let him. JACQUES is yelling desperately. ENZO is now standing on his rock, watching the scene, horrified. The sea now looks as if it were boiling. UNCLE LOUIS grabs hold of JACQUES and hugs him in his arms. Standing on his rock, ENZO is now crying Jacques! Jacques! The last air bubbles are now breaking on the surface; it looks as if they will never stop.
ENZO: ( screaming ) Jacques! Jacques! The last air bubbles are now breaking on the surface; it looks as if they will never stop.
SUPERVISOR: ( exhausted ) Signore Molinari?
ROBERTO: ( shaking his hand ) ( calmly undressing, How did it happen?
ENZO: ( calmly undressing, How did it happen?
SUPERVISOR: ( upset ) The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine. and then the boat turned over. in the current. and. look, I fucked up! Can you How many are, down there? ENZO goes back to the car.
ENZO: How many are, down there? ENZO goes back to the car.
SUPERVISOR: Just one. We're feeding him air, but he's not breathing regularly. You've got to get him out fast. ENZO glances at the map, then at the accident site.
ENZO: ( a beat ) Ten thousand.
SUPERVISOR: You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
ENZO: You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
SUPERVISOR: You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
ROBERTO: You do understand you're talking to the champion diver of the world?
SUPERVISOR: Yes, but ten thousand dollars. ENZO opens the trunk of his FIAT and pulls out the jack. He slams the trunk shut, and stands looking at the American, straight in the eyes.
ENZO: Okay. You tell me. How much would you say the man's life is worth? Extremely uncomfortable, the SUPERVISOR doesn't answer.
ENZO: In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same What does that mean?
SUPERVISOR: ( baffled ) What does that mean?
ROBERTO: That you should get your checkbook. Damn quick.
ROBERTO: Since we have a little time, what do you say you write that check?
ROBERTO: ( to the Supervisor ) Sign here. Suddenly, ENZO appears, burst out of the water, holding his flippers up in the air like a trophy. The onlookers cheer, help him out of the water, slapping him on the ENZO tosses the jack and his flippers to ROBERTO. Impassive and silent, he slips his arms into the prize fighter's robe that ROBERTO holds out for him, walks solemnly back to his car. ROBERTO takes the check and walks over to the car. ENZO bends down into the car and opens the roof.
SUPERVISOR: ( through the open Thanks, thanks a lot. I mean that too. You extortionist bastard! The car rushes off. In the distance we see a police ( carabinieri ) car and an old fire engine rolling in the direction of the construction site.
ENZO: Dollars, Roberto! We took him for ten thousand dollars! ROBERTO whoops and whistles. ENZO reaches over and leans on the horn. The little car races by and finally stops at the top of the cliff facing the sea.
ROBERTO: ( after a while ) Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
ENZO: Have the car painted.
ROBERTO: Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
ENZO: Then tell him to wax it too.
ROBERTO: Enzo, really. What are you going to A rosary for Mama, a dress for Angelica, something with rhine- stones for what's her name, and get yourself a suit that fits. But most important.
ENZO: ( thinking ) A rosary for Mama, a dress for Angelica, something with rhine- stones for what's her name, and get yourself a suit that fits. But most important.
ROBERTO: Find the Frenchman. Find me Mayol.
ENZO: Find the Frenchman. Find me Mayol.
JOHANA: ( in Spanish ) Is this the Lago del Demonio? ( Es bien aqui el Lago del Demonio ) . Huacracocha? The old man goes into a long, rambling explanation. JOHANA nods without understanding a thing.
JOHANA: OLD MAN You welcome.
OLD MAN: You welcome.
FRANK: ( smiling ) Welcome to Peru!
JOHANA: Don't you have a heater?
FRANK: ( hitting at the Yeah. Sure. Is this your first trip to Peru?
JOHANA: Does anybody live to make a second? FRANK smiles and kicks the heating system, then leans over to check it, his eyes off the road.
JOHANA: ( a little worried ) Forget about the heater!
FRANK: A drink to warm up?
JOHANA: Yes, thank you. Intravenous if Tea. or whiskey?
FRANK: ( pulling out a flask ) Tea. or whiskey?
JOHANA: . both. Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles? FRANK smiles and pours some whiskey in her tea cup.
FRANK: . right. Dr. Lawrence? The insurance man. uh. The insurance person is here!
LAWRENCE: It's about time! FRANK smiles and pours JOHANA some tea. She warms her hands on the cup. She asks blankly.
JOHANA: Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
FRANK: The guy in the Halloween suit! LAWRENCE comes in from the other side of the room. He walks straight over to the bay window.
JOHANA: The guy in the Halloween suit! LAWRENCE comes in from the other side of the room. He walks straight over to the bay window.
LAWRENCE: Did you have a nice trip? We were getting restless, it's been three weeks since the accident. JOHANA walks over to the bay window and starts staring at something in the distance.
LAWRENCE: ( to Johana ) You should get things moving, you know. We're out of equipment and we can't do half of our experiments.! Frank, check the program! JOHANA is finally able to speak.
JOHANA: Who. Who is that?
LAWRENCE: Mayol. Jacques Mayol.
JOHANA: That's the experiment? Dumping a guy into a frozen lake? LAWRENCE turns one last knob.
LAWRENCE: . The truck fell into a very deep crevasse. We weren't able to save the equipment.
JOHANA: I'll have to talk to the driver.
LAWRENCE: In the spring when he melts! JOHANA walks closer to the window. She isn't hearing a thing he's saying. JACQUES is putting on his flippers. JOHANA can't believe it. JACQUES is standing by a hole cut in the ice. He is holding onto the machine in the water. He is waving a You really send him under the ice? He isn't a slave or a convict or My dear, science is a cruel But. how is he going to breathe?
JOHANA: ( dumbfounded ) You really send him under the ice? He isn't a slave or a convict or My dear, science is a cruel But. how is he going to breathe?
LAWRENCE: My dear, science is a cruel But. how is he going to breathe?
JOHANA: But. how is he going to breathe?
LAWRENCE: He isn't going to breathe. JACQUES takes a deep breath, turns a handle and a weight yanks him straight down into the water. LAWRENCE sets his stop watch off and flips a few switches. JOHANA grabs his arm as if they could do something about He raises the volume: we hear the man's heartbeat through a small speaker.
LAWRENCE: He raises the volume: we hear the man's heartbeat through a small speaker.
LAWRENCE: That's his heartbeat. Can you hear the speed at which it's slowing down, it's incredible. LAWRENCE tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures on it and hands it to JOHANA. JOHANA feels she's on the verge of crying, and can't figure it out.
LAWRENCE: He's in the fluoroscope now. Listen to his heart. Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore. It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins. until now.
JOHANA: How long can he stay down? Without It depends. He should come up soon. Unless he's decided to stay for the Why is he doing this?
LAWRENCE: It depends. He should come up soon. Unless he's decided to stay for the Why is he doing this?
JOHANA: Why is he doing this?
LAWRENCE: For one thing, it's his job. as for the rest of it, I wish I knew. JOHANA sighs with relief as JACQUES appears at the surface in one big breath.
JOHANA: Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
LAWRENCE: ( smiling at Frank ) Coffee might be nice. She heads towards the Old Peruvian and pours a cup of ( afterthought ) Will he understand Spanish?
JOHANA: ( afterthought ) Will he understand Spanish?
LAWRENCE: His mother's an American. He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
JACQUES: ( puzzled ) I recognize you.
JOHANA: We saw each other a little while In the lake?
JACQUES: ( serious ) In the lake?
JOHANA: ( wondering whether he No. in the hut. After a long beat.
JACQUES: ( with a beautiful Then it was somebody that looked a lot like you. Thank you. JACQUES then turns around and walks toward the huts. JOHANA still hasn't moved, as if petrified by her emotions and the severe cold. She then walks up to the hole in the ice and peers into the dark water. She shudders.
DRIVER: It's beautiful, isn't it? JACQUES smiles.
DRIVER: We had some bad wind this week. The "Mistral"!! "Peuchere"! There isn't one olive left on its tree. It suddenly left us this morning. I sure won't be the one to call it EXT. ANTIBES - ROAD TO MARINELAND The taxi comes to a stop in front of Marineland. JACQUES gets out, carrying one of his bags.
JACQUES: ( to the driver ) I'll only be five minutes. He enters Marineland.
JACQUES: Good morning, everybody! Did you sleep well? I slept in a plane, and it wasn't too great. He opens his duffel bag. Hunts around, comes up with two packages wrapped in brownpaper. The dolphins stare at him, intrigued.
JACQUES: ( calling out ) Hey! presents. The dolphins CACKLE some more.
JACQUES: You think I'd forget you? He laughs. The driver, who seems to be quite familiar with the place, walks in heading straight over to the soda machine. Out of the corner of his eye, he takes in the scene, very intrigued. JACQUES has not noticed him. He starts unwrapping the first package.
JACQUES: For Bathsheba. He produces a little ceramic Llama.
ON BATHSHEBA: looking at the llama, bewildered. As bewildered as a dolphin can be. JACQUES turns the llama upside down. It moos: HIAK, HIAK.
JACQUES: It's a Llama. You understand? From Peru. It's fighting. BATHSHEBA shakes her head. JACQUES throws the llama into the water. He unwraps the second package. A pair of Peruvian gloves and hat. Wide eyed, the driver sits in the stands to watch the show.
JACQUES: That's for you, Darjeeling. We wouldn't want you to catch cold! He throws them to DARJEELING who catches them.
JACQUES: And now. "Ta, da." For you Tina. He pulls out a thermos.
JACQUES: Something you've never seen either. He opens the thermos.
JACQUES: He sprinkles snow flakes on TINA'S head. She tries to taste it.
JACQUES: ( smiling like a A new experience, Tina. ( nostalgic ) I missed you little rascals. Did you get my post card? The three dolphins leap into the air and land with a huge splash which soaks JACQUES. He takes his shirt off.
JACQUES: ( pretending to be Oh? Is that what you want? Alright, but five minutes, no more. I have a taxi waiting. He takes off his pants. The taxi driver gets up, as if to keep him from going in. JACQUES dives into the pool.
JOHANA: . Sally? The door opens.
SALLY: You're back! Hello. We were They got the new T.V. JOHANA comes in, looks at the ransacked apartment.

JOHANA: You called the police?
SALLY: They're going to send detectives. When they get around to it.
JOHANA: ( shrugging ) So what, all they ever want is your phone number anyway. JOHANA goes over, slumps into an easy chair and sighs. After a beat.
SALLY: How was your trip?
JOHANA: How was your trip?
SALLY: How was your trip?
JOHANA: ( flatly ) Nice. Very interesting. Great! ( doubtfully ) . I guess.
SALLY: ( ironically ) Okay. Who'd you meet? JOHANA opens her handbag, takes out the strip of electrocardiogram paper, hands it to her.
SALLY: A cardiogram.? You met a doctor! Congratulations, you're in the Unless they have socialized medicine in Peru. Do they?

And the cutest smile. He wasn't smiling at me, I don't think just smiling. And he thought he saw me in the lake. I mean that was a figure of speech. They're so romantic, the French.
SALLY: ( bored, half asleep ) I thought you said he was Peruvian?
JOHANA: ( annoyed ) Haven't you been listening? SALLY opens the drapes, revealing it's dawn outside.
SALLY: . Since eight o'clock last night.! You're in love.
JOHANA: Don't be a jerk. There's no such thing as love at first sight.
ENZO: Jacques, my friend, how are you?
JACQUES: ( happy ) A beat.
ENZO: I leave you swimming and twenty years later, you're still in the water! What the hell are you doing? An uneasiness sweeps over ENZO'S face and quickly That's good. You never would have recognized me, huh? Check out the suit! Looking good, no? You know I'm the world Yes, I know.

ENZO: ( serious ) Doesn't it surprise you that I just show up like this. Listen, the world championship starts in ten days in Taormina. Be my guest. ENZO puts down an airplane ticket on the side of the pool.
ENZO: Your ticket. Surprised, JACQUES looks over at the ticket.
JACQUES: Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
ENZO: Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
JACQUES: ( shaking his head ) I don't want to be in any competition. I dive because I like to, not to beat a record. don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
ENZO: No. All you need is to want to be the best.
JACQUES: ( smiles ) You're the best, Enzo!
ENZO: ( with a tense grin That's too easy! Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me: "D'you know that French guy, Mayol? He's supposed to be very good!

JACQUES: ( more and more Yes, but. So, you haven't got a room left?
RECEPTIONIST: No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
JACQUES: The Receptionist starts working on his papers again. JACQUES, completely lost, stares blankly at the hotel clerk, wondering what to do next.
ENZO: ( to doorman ) Be careful with that car, it's a new paint job. ENZO enters the hotel and sees JACQUES.
ENZO: ( yelling across the Giacomino! My friend! My brother! ENZO and JACQUES. The two men kiss each other on both cheeks, pound each others back. They are both moved.

ENZO: Take mine. I'll take the Countess' suite. She told me she was leaving for the cemetery. She'll be more comfortable there. PAOLO half-heartedly, hands him the key. ENZO glances at JACQUES to make sure he's properly impressed. He throws his arm around JACQUES' shoulder, hugs him and gives him a real smile.
ENZO: ( sincerely ) I'm glad you're here.
ENZO: ( to waiter ) "Spaghetti del mare" ( to Jacques ) It's delicious here. It's the one thing they really know how to make.
WAITER: Del mare for two?
JACQUES: ( nodding quickly ) Yes, sure, for two.
ENZO: And a bottle of "Frascatti". Two Si Signore, grazie mille. The waiter hurries away. ENZO watches his departure, then He moves just like a woman. It must be hard to live in two worlds like that, huh? To breathe in one, swim in the other. JACQUES nods without really knowing.
WAITER: Si Signore, grazie mille. The waiter hurries away. ENZO watches his departure, then He moves just like a woman. It must be hard to live in two worlds like that, huh? To breathe in one, swim in the other. JACQUES nods without really knowing.
ENZO: He moves just like a woman. It must be hard to live in two worlds like that, huh? To breathe in one, swim in the other. JACQUES nods without really knowing.
ENZO: ( suddenly louder ) Anyway! Nothing beats a sexy broad! Huh, Jacques! ENZO starts laughing. JACQUES would like to crawl under the table.
ENZO: . So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask. Am I right?
JACQUES: ( quickly ) Yes, of course. Lots of questions. JACQUES is satisfied with his answer. He thinks that the subject is closed. They eat silently for a moment. ENZO watches him. Then:
ENZO: Well, what are they?
JACQUES: ( giving up ) I'm sorry. I don't know how to ask the questions. ENZO bursts out laughing.
ENZO: Well, then. I'll do the asking for you. "Tell me dear Enzo, how did you become World Champion?" Oh, that's a long story. Well, after you left Amorgos, I went back to Italy and joined the Navy. So you now have in front of you Captain Molinari, who's been on leave of absence for the past 14 That's good.
JACQUES: That's good.
ENZO: How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
JACQUES: It's okay.
ENZO: . You married? JACQUES doesn't seem to have ever thought about marriage.
JACQUES: Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule! I was engaged. for a week. After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls. JACQUES smiles.
ENZO: Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule! I was engaged. for a week. After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls. JACQUES smiles.
ENZO: So, not married. Well, good for you. You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
JACQUES: ( bluffing ) Exactly, I mean, after all, we're ( slapping the table Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a ( concerned ) People say that?
ENZO: ( slapping the table Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a ( concerned ) People say that?
JACQUES: ( concerned ) People say that?
ENZO: ( sorry he went too Forget it. I was joking.
ENZO: Eh! La Madonna! This one is for me. I'll bet you my watch that she's in my bed tonight. JACQUES turns around and recognizes her. JOHANA smiles and walks up to the table. ENZO takes his watch off and puts it on the table.
ENZO: ( quickly ) I tell you she's mine!
JOHANA: ( to Jacques ) ( surprised ) You know each other?
ENZO: ( surprised ) You know each other?
JOHANA: Enzo Molinari. ENZO kisses her hand and brushes his watch off the table in the same movement.
ENZO: Enzo Molinari. ENZO kisses her hand and brushes his watch off the table in the same movement.
ENZO: This is a great pleasure.
JOHANA: ( laughing at the Johana Cross, pleased to meet you. ( then to Jacques, Well! Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this. All the way out here. It's incredible!
JACQUES: Please, have a seat.
JOHANA: Thank you. I wouldn't want to interrupt anything. JOHANA sits down.
JACQUES: No, no!
ENZO: Not at all!
JACQUES: You're staying at the hotel?
JOHANA: I wish, but it's full. They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full. What's going on here?
ENZO: It's the Free Diving World Championship. I am by the way world JOHANA has turned toward JACQUES, paying no attention to ENZO. JACQUES can't stop looking at JOHANA.
JACQUES: But what brought you to Sicily?
JOHANA: I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo. I work for an insurance company. So, I decided to take a few days I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
ENZO: There is no place in the world more beautiful than Sicily! The waiter passes behind them. ENZO reaches out, grabs him by the arm, pulls him to the table.
ENZO: ( to waiter ) A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance ( smiling ) I think I'll have a coffee.
JOHANA: ( smiling ) I think I'll have a coffee.
JACQUES: No, no. You'll like it. It's . Okay. I'll try. ENZO pours the wine. JOHANA shrugs fatalistically. The waiter leaves. JACQUES, intrigued, stares at JOHANA. She pretends not to Where did you two meet?
JOHANA: . Okay. I'll try. ENZO pours the wine. JOHANA shrugs fatalistically. The waiter leaves. JACQUES, intrigued, stares at JOHANA. She pretends not to Where did you two meet?
ENZO: ( impatient ) Where did you two meet?
JOHANA: In a lake.
ENZO: I might have known. As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
JOHANA: Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world. One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort.
ENZO: Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world. One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort.
JACQUES: ( interrupting ) ( annoyed ) Your mother?
ENZO: ( annoyed ) Your mother?
JACQUES: Your mother?
ENZO: Ahi, ahi, cazzo! Ma mamia! Where.? God, she'll kill me. . if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant. He quickly brushes off the crumbs in front of him.
ENZO: . Mamma!
MAMMA MOLINARI: ( expressionless ) You expect me to carry all the luggage myself?
ENZO: Mamma. Roberto and an elevator. Isn't that enough? A beat. Signora MOLINARI inspects the plates on the What have you been eating?
MAMMA MOLINARI: ( suspiciously ) What have you been eating?
ENZO: Coffee only, I'm diving tomorrow. You remember little Jacques, Jacques . And his friend, Johana. Signora MOLINARI nods grudgingly.
JACQUES: ( timidly ) . And his friend, Johana. Signora MOLINARI nods grudgingly.
ENZO: . And his friend, Johana. Signora MOLINARI nods grudgingly.
WAITER: ( arriving proudly ) Spaghetti del mare! Dead silence. ENZO is the only one with no plate in front of him. Signora MOLINARI'S eyebrows condense into a dark stripe across her forehead. JOHANA hands ENZO'S plate to the WAITER and takes the full ( to waiter ) Thank you. And begins to eat, ignoring the expressions of amazement all around her.
JOHANA: ( to waiter ) Thank you. And begins to eat, ignoring the expressions of amazement all around her.
MAMMA MOLINARI: JOHANA nods enthusiastically, her mouth too full to speak.
MAMMA MOLINARI: ( impressed, to MAMMA MOLINARI has a huge grin on her face.
JOHANA: Thanks for helping with the bag. It looks great!
JACQUES: I thought it was a nice place. Isn't it?
JOHANA: I'm being a pain in the ass. It's beautiful here. They look at each other. JACQUES is silent. He just stands there, a suitcase in each hand. JOHANA breaks the silence.
JOHANA: You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
JACQUES: I don't know. why?
JOHANA: Just because. I would have liked to visit the town. See the coast. I don't know anybody. Expect for you. But you are going to be very busy. You must have tons of things to prepare, interviews. And a competition like this one must require a great deal of concentration, right?
JACQUES: ( shakes his head Yes. Maybe. I don't know. I don't like competitions. It ruins the fun. Don't you think?
JOHANA: ( with a faint smile ) I guess. But you know. I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive. There's always pleasure of being the best?
JACQUES: Maybe on earth there is one. but not when you dive. You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason. just to do it. It's a feeling. I don't know how to say this. Voluptuous? He looks up at her as he pronounces the last word. She smiles at him, lovingly.
JOHANA: ( laughing ) You can put down the suitcases, you He lets go of the suitcases. Suddenly, behind them, there is a loud screech of tires. The FIAT tears across the ENZO in his FIAT. He pokes his head out of the window.
ENZO: C'mon, you two. Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight. We have a new world I'm a little tired, I don't know Get in the car!
JACQUES: I'm a little tired, I don't know Get in the car!
ENZO: Get in the car!
ENZO: Roberto! The bow-tie! ROBERTO hands ENZO the bow-tie, he hooks it around JACQUES' collar.
ENZO: ( taking a few steps Very good. JACQUES looks down at his tennis shoes.
ROBERTO: What about the shoes?
ENZO: Very chic. Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
JACQUES: Then, it's very chic. Avanti!
ENZO: Then, it's very chic. Avanti!
JOHANA: I thought you'd be at the dinner.
JACQUES: It's too loud for me. He tugs at his over-sized tuxedo.
JOHANA: You look adorable.
JACQUES: Thank you.
JOHANA: ( smiling ) . Especially the sneakers. JACQUES looks down at his feet, doesn't know what to make of her comment. JOHANA sits down beside him and pours herself a drink. They touch glasses.
NOVELLI: Ladies and Gentlemen, your attention, please. Mr. Andre Bonnet, President of the International Diving Championship Committee, is going to present this trophy to the new world champion of free diving. This afternoon, our new champion descended to the remarkable depth of 280 feet. The audience applauds.
NOVELLI: This young man Tia. NOVELLI can't quite read his notes.
NOVELLI: Tiraro. Tirao-re. Moa. ANDRE BONNET takes his turn to read the note. A young Tahitian jumps up, heads for the podium.
TAHITIAN: Tiraero Moameora. NOVELLI hesitates to repeat the name.
NOVELLI: . Let's all give him a big hand. The audience cheers and applauds the new champion. ENZO sits at a table, watching the ceremony.
ENZO: ( very sarcastic ) A one day hero! He gets up and walks out of the room.
ENZO: A new world record! That's great! It gives me something to beat You ever been to Tahiti?
JOHANA: I'll take you there. We'll live in the sun. You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut JOHANA smiles and shakes her head.
ENZO: I'll take you there. We'll live in the sun. You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut JOHANA smiles and shakes her head.
JOHANA: You forgot the Hula!
ENZO: Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
JOHANA: You'll be lovely, but no thanks. Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
JACQUES: I don't know how. Excuse me. JACQUES leaves the bar. JOHANA watches him go. ENZO notices her way of watching him. He's a little jealous.
ENZO: He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
JOHANA: Have you known him long?
ENZO: Forever. We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were What was he like, when he was little?
JOHANA: What was he like, when he was little?
ENZO: Little. Very little. And skinny, very skinny too. That is compared to me.
JOHANA: ( amused ) I get it, Enzo you were a superior Exactly! What is it Johana? You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?! She doesn't answer.
ENZO: Exactly! What is it Johana? You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?! She doesn't answer.
ENZO: Forget it, don't think of Jacques as a human being. He's from another She smiles.
JOHANA: And just where are you from?
ENZO: EXT. TERRACE OF THE HOTEL - NIGHT ENZO sits at the grand piano in the corner of the terrace. Beethoven was always a favorite of his. JACQUES, very tipsy by now walks over, a glass in each hand. He hands ENZO a glass, then takes off his tennis shoes and sits them neatly on the piano.
ENZO: There is nothing like music. It speaks from the heart. Can you tell me why we bother diving in the dark, the cold, without ever taking the time to breathe? Huh? Can you tell me why we do it? JACQUES nods.
ENZO: . For the mermaids. ENZO smiles, moved.
JACQUES: . For the mermaids. ENZO smiles, moved.
ENZO: My father used to see them everywhere too. but the only one he ever caught was my mother. Actually she caught him. A beat.
JACQUES: Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
ENZO: Ah ha. You finally want to know about women.
JACQUES: Why? Are they what's most No. It depends. Sometimes they are. What, exactly do you want to . Everything.
ENZO: No. It depends. Sometimes they are. What, exactly do you want to . Everything.
JACQUES: . Everything.
ENZO: Everything about what?
JACQUES: ( thinking ) Well. about everything. ENZO grins at JACQUES and starts playing again.
ENZO: . So, between Mamma, Roberto and the sisters, we yell and scream all day long. Except with Angelica. She just cries. And then finally, we all end up kissing. Can you explain that to me? JACQUES can't answer.
ENZO: Because that's what love is all about. It's a pain in the ass but keeps us together. A large and beautiful family! JOHANA walks over to them.
JACQUES: ( suddenly ) Enzo. We must quit the ENZO hits a wrong note on the piano.
ENZO: ( worried ) If we don't. I'm going to beat JOHANA stands next to JACQUES.
JACQUES: If we don't. I'm going to beat JOHANA stands next to JACQUES.
ENZO: ( with a nervous Huh? Well listen to him! ( to Johana ) Do you hear that?
JOHANA: He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says: "I'm going to beat you".
ENZO: He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says: "I'm going to beat you".
JOHANA: ( with a smile ) . That's what he's here for, isn't Listen to her! "That's what he's here for"! He's here to loose, that's what he's here for. First of all, I'm unbeatable. Second, how old are you?
ENZO: Listen to her! "That's what he's here for"! He's here to loose, that's what he's here for. First of all, I'm unbeatable. Second, how old are you?
JACQUES: Two years younger than you.
ENZO: As I said, second of all you're too skinny. You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
JACQUES: The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
ENZO: Look at me. These aren't lungs. These are. Tanks. How long can you hold your breath? ENZO is getting really angry. The drinks have a lot to do with it.
JACQUES: ( impatiently ) I don't know. Longer than you. ENZO pulls open his collar and rises.
ENZO: We'll see.
JOHANA: Take it easy.
PARAMEDIC: Don't worry, he's empty now. He needs sleep, that's all. The two men leave the room. JOHANA walks over to the chair and rearranges JACQUES' shirt and jacket which the paramedic had thrown down. JACQUES looks like he's just had a very rough night. He sits up and grabs the sides of the bed, as if he were on a moving boat.
JACQUES: Who won? JOHANA turns around, furious.
JOHANA: Won what? The Ass Hole Award? Well, let me tell you, it's a tie! She walks over to the bed.
JOHANA: Acting like a pair of two year olds! You could have died in that damn Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
JACQUES: Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
JOHANA: ( smiling ) Lucky I was there to save you.
JACQUES: ( seeing her wet You jumped in?
JOHANA: Only to help the medics, I assure My wallet. JOHANA wet, walks over to the wet clothes on the chair. She pulls out JACQUES soaking wallet from one of the jacket pockets.
JACQUES: My wallet. JOHANA wet, walks over to the wet clothes on the chair. She pulls out JACQUES soaking wallet from one of the jacket pockets.
JOHANA: It's still here. She tries to wipe it.
JACQUES: No. I want to show you. Is it Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures. Not even for pictures of dolphins.
JOHANA: Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures. Not even for pictures of dolphins.
JACQUES: Give it to me. JOHANA hands him the photograph. He stares at it, looking very sad. Worried JOHANA sits down next to him.
JACQUES: ( on the verge of My real family. ( he looks at the What kind of man has such a family? She takes the picture out of his hands. He is so upset that JOHANA can hardly help from crying with him. She sits next to him and strokes his hair.
JACQUES: I'm sick of never feeling at home JOHANA takes him in her arms. He breaks down.
ROBERTO: Enzo, wake up!
ENZO: ( pulled from his Eh? Si! Avanti! He gets up on one arm.
ROBERTO: The medics are looking all over for I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down. I can take a five minute nap, can't I? The boat stops. The anchor is thrown over board. The sailors, technicians and officials are getting ready for the competition. Today is ENZO'S turn to dive. A man is hooking a plaque indicating the depth ( 324 feet ) onto a lead disk which he heaves into the water on a cable.
ENZO: ( irritated ) I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down. I can take a five minute nap, can't I? The boat stops. The anchor is thrown over board. The sailors, technicians and officials are getting ready for the competition. Today is ENZO'S turn to dive. A man is hooking a plaque indicating the depth ( 324 feet ) onto a lead disk which he heaves into the water on a cable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Molinari, I'm terribly sorry but I cannot allow you to dive in such an advanced state of exhaustion. ENZO jumps to his feet, grabs the doctor by his lapels, lifts him in the air.
ENZO: ( outraged ) What do you know about the sea? Huh? Nothing! So you just put your tubes and tin cans away. The sea is mine! I know when she is ready for me and when she isn't. And today, she is ready. Understand?
DOCTOR: You dive at your own risk. You're been warned. ENZO smiles and pats the doctor on the shoulder.
ENZO: EXT. YACHT - ON DIVING PLATFORM It's a large float, rigged to the stern of the Committee Boat. ROBERTO and an assistant help ENZO down the swim ladder to the platform. He's wearing a wet suit and fins. He flip-flops to the end of the platform. ROBERTO hands him his mask. The goggles are filled with polystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible. Only two pinholes to see through. The mask fits tightly over his nose. When ENZO puts it on, he looks like an astonished insect. ENZO breathes faster and faster. ROBERTO holds the wire controlling the weighted diving apparatus. ENZO crosses himself, takes a last long gulp of air. ROBERTO releases the weight. It sinks and drags ENZO down, he quickly disappears into the dark water.
JOHANA: You scared me! JACQUES picks up the book. JOHANA smiles.
JOHANA: Just checking up on your family. I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress. Well.
JACQUES: I'm glad you stayed. Thank you.
JOHANA: ( getting up ) I'd better get back now.
JACQUES: You. You wouldn't want to spend the day with me? She sits back in her chair, amazed that he would even ask.
JACQUES: ( self conscious ) . No?
JOHANA: No? Huh? Yes, of course!!
JACQUES: What's the matter?
TRAINER: I don't understand. We've tried for two days. They won't eat. They won't perform. It's since we got the new one.
JACQUES: Is she the new one? Surprised, the trainer nods. JOHANA looks over at JACQUES then at the dolphin. She doesn't understand.
JOHANA: How can you tell it's a female?
JACQUES: . The way she moves. Three other dolphins gather around the one that JACQUES is JACQUES is staring at the female dolphin. It looks like the animal is trying to tell him something. Suddenly the dolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the UNDERWATER - DOLPHIN POOL JACQUES hangs onto the dolphin's muzzle. Let's it pull him along. The dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool, and pulls JACQUES to the bottom. The other dolphins circle above.
TRAINER: Did you ever think of trying the public pool?
JOHANA: He's a dolphin specialist.
TRAINER: In that case what's wrong with the new one? Is she sick or not.
JACQUES: ( taking his time to Not the way you mean.
TRAINER: What am I supposed to do? Do I call the dealer.? The investment, you understand. I certainly am entitled to complain!
JACQUES: It's going to cost you more than you JACQUES turns around and walks off. JOHANA catches up with him.
JACQUES: She's not like the others. She can't stand to be away from the sea.
JOHANA: ( impressed ) How do you know that?
JACQUES: ( stopping ) I don't know, I just feel it.
ENZO: ( screaming ) Ah! Jacques! ENZO grabs hold of his shoulders. JACQUES and JOHANA are completely soaked.
ENZO: Don't be sad, I only took back what was mine. He gives JACQUES the diving plaque, it reads 280 feet.
ENZO: Here, it's a present. JOHANA and JACQUES smile at each other. JACQUES has won his bet.
JACQUES: ( touched ) . Thank you. ENZO slaps him on the shoulder.
ENZO: ( to Johana ) Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves. 8 o'clock in my ENZO walks off then turns back toward them. He whispers in JACQUES' ear.
JOHANA: ENZO walks off then turns back toward them. He whispers in JACQUES' ear.
ENZO: Tell me. Can you explain why you are soaking wet? A beat.
JOHANA: . We're in training. ENZO walks off.
NOVELLI: ( through the door ) Mr. Roberto, tell your brother to be reasonable. Everyone is waiting for him upstairs. The photographers are there, the press.
NOVELLI: ( trying to keep his Shall we call a doctor?
ROBERTO: No, it's okay. Mamma is going to try something. JACQUES and JOHANA walk up from the other side of the hall and stop in front of the same door.
NOVELLI: Mr. Mayol, help us. He refuses to receive his medal and everybody is waiting for him up there. We already have problems with the press because of the danger, and if we don't even have the divers help.!
JACQUES: ( dubious ) . I'll do my best.
NOVELLI: That's very kind of you. JACQUES knocks on the door.
JACQUES: It's Jacques. Mayol! A beat. Then ENZO opens the door himself.
ENZO: Jacques! My friend! Come on in! The officials look at each other baffled.
NOVELLI: Mr. Enzo Molinari, allow me to impress upon you the importance of your attending the Award Ceremony. For the press.
ENZO: ( loosing his temper ) I think my brother told you I was indisposed, that should do it, no? I'm allowed to be indisposed, right? So, you just tell the press that the "big" Enzo Molinari, overwhelmed by his inspiring descent to 324 feet, will not be able to receive this trinket because he is. He looks inquisitively at the three men. ENZO looses his Because he is?!
ENZO: Because he is?!
ENZO: ( smiling ) He slams the door in their face.
JACQUES: Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
ENZO: Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente". So the trinket will just have to wait a bit. ENZO takes JACQUES by the shoulder. Inside his room is absolute chaos: dancing, singing, eating. Wet suits hung out to dry everywhere. MAMMA MOLINARI is whipping up mountains of spaghetti on an improvised stove in the middle of the room. A lot of smoke. steam. color. noise. All of Italy crammed into a few square feet. JOHANA taken in by the warm atmosphere, sits in a corner of the room. JACQUES walks over and sits down at her Mamma! La pasta?!
ENZO: ( to Mamma ) Mamma! La pasta?!
MAMMA MOLINARI: Arrivo! Arrivo! She points at ROBERTO who is taking forever to grate the cheese. ENZO grabs the guitar from his other brother's hands and starts playing.
ENZO: . It's easy. You go down. You come up. . Right, Johana?
JOHANA: ( smiling ) Congratulations, Enzo.
ENZO: Don't you agree, Jacques?
JACQUES: . You always were the best. ENZO laughs then sees his mother.
ENZO: Ah! La pasta! ENZO starts singing in Italian. MAMMA MOLINARI serves the pasta, ROBERTO follows her around, sprinkling his cheese on the plates. She serves JOHANA a huge plate of pasta, enough for three giants.
MAMMA MOLINARI: ( with a smile ) Buon appetito, Signorina! JOHANA who isn't even hungry, grins uncertainly. JACQUES has walked up to ENZO. He doesn't dare ask his question.
ENZO: ( smiling ) What's the matter? You still have a bunch of things to ask me? You want to know the price of tea in China of how we landed on the moon? Is that ENZO laughs. JACQUES is serious.
JACQUES: No, I have to ask you a favor. You're the only one who'll . I'm listening.
ENZO: ( seriously ) . I'm listening.
MAMMA MOLINARI: Tutto va bene? The three officials are eating pasta, plates on their knees. Their mouths are too full to speak, they nod Gracie mille, chignora. MAMMA MOLINARI smiles and slams the door.
NOVELLI: ( mouth full ) Gracie mille, chignora. MAMMA MOLINARI smiles and slams the door.
ENZO: ( leaning forward ) Hey! Will you slow down! When did you learn how to drive?
JACQUES: Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road. JACQUES runs a red light.
ENZO: And the lights! Running lights, stealing stretchers.! You'll have us in jail.
JOHANA: Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
JACQUES: ( moved ) You can't stay here! Come on! Go JACQUES swims off with her for a while. ENZO walks back toward the car with the stretcher. JOHANA, standing by the water looks at JACQUES and the dolphin who are swimming off together. JACQUES keeps splashing the dolphin as they swim.
ENZO: You can stop that now, she has all the water she needs. JACQUES cannot get rid of the dolphin.
ENZO: All right, we did it. Let's go back to the party. JACQUES and the dolphin can't seem to part.
JACQUES: Just one minute. JOHANA is worried, she walks up to ENZO who goes back into the water and takes JACQUES by the arm.
ENZO: Jacques, the dolphin is home now. And that's where we're going. Come on! Hurry up now. Our girlfriend is freezing over there. The dolphin starts swimming off. JACQUES follows ENZO EXT. JOHANA'S PENSION - NIGHT ENZO stops the FIAT in front of the pension. The three of them get out. ENZO hasn't bothered to dress. JOHANA heads for the gate, she obviously has no desire of leaving JACQUES.
JOHANA: Well, good night, then.
ENZO: You going to sleep here, all by She looks over at the pension, having a hard time concealing her lack of enthusiasm.
JOHANA: She looks over at the pension, having a hard time concealing her lack of enthusiasm.
JOHANA: . It's a comfortable place.
ENZO: Sinister is what I'd call it.! Ours is so much cheerful! Why don't you come and stay with me. There's plenty of room in my suite.
JOHANA: ( smiles ) The Mamma's there too.
ENZO: ( face clouds up ) Yes, the Mamma is is there.
JOHANA: Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
JACQUES: Good night.
ENZO: ( to Jacques ) You don't need a stretcher to take her with you. You know that, don't The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
JACQUES: The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
ENZO: The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
JOHANA: Leave it alone, Enzo, it's okay. She rings the bell for the concierge, then looks back at
JOHANA: Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
JACQUES: ( lost ) Uh. Yes, of course! The concierge comes out and opens the iron gate for her. JOHANA disappears into the parc. ENZO turns to JACQUES.
ENZO: You really do have a few things to learn about women!
JOHANA: What are they for?
NOVELLI: They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.
JOHANA: ( just checking ) If there was a problem, they could do something right?
NOVELLI: Of course, that's what they're for. JOHANA sees scuba divers with weird air tanks.
JOHANA: ( pointing ) . And those?
NOVELLI: Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet. They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture. At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon What's that little air bottle on the That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon. It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator. Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea But doesn't Jacques dive without Yes. It's magic.

JOHANA: ( shocked ) But doesn't Jacques dive without ( smiling ) Yes. It's magic.
NOVELLI: ( smiling ) Yes. It's magic.
HIS POV: The figures on the platform are vague, the VOICES are GARBLED and incomprehensible. Moving almost in slow motion he raises three fingers.
TECHNICIAN: Tre minuti!
TECHNICIAN: Due minuti! JACQUES fills a small tube with water. Pours it into his nostrils. tilts his head. then lets it run out. He puts on his gloves. all his movements are slow, he seems to be operating in a different time zone. He seems unable to take his eyes off the water.
TECHNICIAN: Uno minuto! JACQUES puts his nose clip on. He puts his hand on the gueuse. Closes his eyes and inhales slowly. Then he takes a sudden last breath, nods, the technician releases the gueuse and in one flashing movement, he disappears.
UNDERWATER: The gueuse slides down the cable. JACQUES hangs on like a ribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down. Above him, the boat disappears from sight. He moves faster and faster. through a sea that looks like a cloudy sky. The light fades rapidly around him. Below, white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night. JACQUES reaches them in a matter of seconds. Turns the brakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down. The medics are waiting for him there. They take his pulse. Check his eyes. 15 seconds. normal. the bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around JACQUES closes his eyes. a tap on the shoulder, he releases the brake on the gueuse. Plunges further, this time into pitch black. Below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom. He reaches it and the dark diver moves to him. JACQUES brakes his machine. Moving very slowly, turns his body right side up. Like a sleep walker, JACQUES starts to take the plaque off the plumbline. pauses in the middle of the gesture. The dark diver flashes the high sign to JACQUES, thumb and forefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear. JACQUES does not respond. The diver repeats the signal. JACQUES does not respond. The diver taps JACQUES on the shoulder. a beat. and then JACQUES responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay. Slowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle of the balloon. The dark diver quickly turns the handle for him. The balloon inflates. JACQUES hangs on. lets it carry him At the plague marking 210 feet, JACQUES lets go of the the balloon. With a burst of speed, it darts toward the JACQUES follows slowly, undulating like a fish. He's getting warm now. He closes his eyes. Passes the medical control without stopping. without even seeing it like someone asleep. He's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air. JACQUES opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter. The silhouette of the boat comes back into view. 60 feet to go.
JOHANA: ( excited ) Jacques, listen to the applause. He doesn't respond.
JOHANA: ( trying to keep up ) Jacques, you set a world record.
JACQUES: I did?
JOHANA: Aren't you happy? Don't you feel proud.? I feel proud and all I did was watch. He is staring at her, he's returning to the real world. Slowly he smiles. She grabs hold of his arm and gives him a proud kiss on the mouth. JACQUES is a little stunned.
ENZO: Congratulations Jacques! It's wonderful! Wonderful! He drops his packages on the bar and gives Jacques a big I'm happy for you! He kisses him and starts handing out his presents.
ENZO: I'm happy for you! He kisses him and starts handing out his presents.
ENZO: ( to Jacques ) ( to Johana ) What is it?
JACQUES: What is it?
ENZO: Little presents, nothing much. I knew it, I just knew it! Look here! He holds up his arm: he is wearing two watches.
ENZO: Roberto's watch! I won it! He bet that you couldn't beat me! JACQUES opens his present. It's a little ceramic dolphin.
ENZO: You still collect them?
JACQUES: You don't have that one, do you?
ENZO: You don't have that one, do you?
JACQUES: No. Thank you. It's really Oh it's nothing. I knew it. I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good". I lost my title but I won a watch! JOHANA has opened her package. It's a big plate with a text engraved on it.
ENZO: Oh it's nothing. I knew it. I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good". I lost my title but I won a watch! JOHANA has opened her package. It's a big plate with a text engraved on it.
JOHANA: Is it a poem?
ENZO: No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare". You see I was right in getting you out here. You're a world champion, my friend! JACQUES has opened the last small package. It's a measuring tape. He looks at it without understanding. ENZO explains:
ENZO: It's a measuring tape. He grabs hold of the tape and lets it roll to the ground.
ENZO: You see this is your record, three feet more than mine! Looking at it from here, it doesn't look like much, does it? JACQUES looks at him without saying a word. ENZO hands him the measuring tape.
ENZO: Keep your little measuring tape, my friend, it will be a nice souvenir when I beat you next. ENZO taps his shoulder and smiles.
LATER: JACQUES is in bed with JOHANA. They are both asleep. Suddenly, he sits up, as he always does after his recurrent dream. He's wide awake, looks over at her sleeping. She sleeps peacefully like a baby. Quietly, gently, he eases out of bed and walks to the open window. He stands on the balcony, staring at the sea. Then in the distance in the moonlight, a dolphin leaps out of the water, once, twice, a third time. JACQUES laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down next to JOHANA. She is still sound asleep.
JOHANA: She gets up and walks over to the balcony. She doesn't see anything.
JACQUES: ( warm ) What are you doing here? She answers in a far away voice, with the same serene I'm going to leave, Jacques. Dripping with water, he sits down next to her. His face is drawn from fatigue. She continues.
JOHANA: I'm going to leave, Jacques. Dripping with water, he sits down next to her. His face is drawn from fatigue. She continues.
JOHANA: I'm going back home.
JACQUES: Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
JOHANA: Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
JACQUES: I'm not from the sea. I don't understand what you're talking Yes you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready. at least not for me.
JOHANA: Yes you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready. at least not for me.
JACQUES: But it's not true, I feel good with you. It feels right. She looks at him for a moment, then takes his face in her hands and rests it on her bosom, as if a small child.
JOHANA: I've got to get back to the hotel. and get my suitcase packed.
JACQUES: Will. will we see each other JOHANA'S eyes are filled with tears.
JOHANA: Take good care of yourself, Jacques. The train starts pulling out of the station.
JACQUES: Where can I call you? Johana, tell me where can I call you? JOHANA doesn't answer. JACQUES stands helplessly in the station, his eyes filled with tears.
JACQUES: Can I come in?
ENZO: No problem, I enjoy talking in my ENZO walks back into the apartment and crashes on the bed. He's lying on his stomach. JACQUES walks in and lets himself drop in a chair.
ENZO: Wake me up at 11:00. ENZO closes his eyes. JACQUES looks over at the clock, it says 11:25. JACQUES doesn't say anything and stares blankly out of the window.
ENZO: ( opening one eye ) Hmmm! Something wrong? JACQUES doesn't answer.
ENZO: Is it the girl? JACQUES stares out the window.
ENZO: Did she leave? No answer. ENZO gets up and sits on the side of the bed.
ENZO: Hey! I'm going to take care of you! I've got this job, on an oil rig, no sweat! I'm taking you along. Come on! Get your bags packed! You're coming with me, I tell you! He pats him on the back.
ENZO: We'll make a great team, the two of us. You'll see!
SUPERINTENDENT: Mayol, Molinari.? They nod.
SUPERINTENDENT: We've been waiting for you for three days. Goddamnit!
ENZO: Is that the way you talk to the best diver in the world.? And to his friend Jacques Mayol! The SUPERINTENDENT smiles sourly, and gestures to a Show them their quarters. Five minutes later, JACQUES and ENZO are following the He doesn't like us.
SUPERINTENDENT: Show them their quarters. Five minutes later, JACQUES and ENZO are following the He doesn't like us.
JACQUES: ( whispering ) He doesn't like us.
ENZO: So what!? His job is to hand out the paychecks. And he does that very well, let me tell you.
ENZO: ( suddenly ) You still thinking about her? JACQUES doesn't answer. ENZO goes on.
ENZO: Don't think about her anymore! Let me tell you, you're just making yourself unhappy! There are so many women in the world! He takes a cigarette from a pouch in his diving suit and stares at NOIREUTER.
ENZO: Plenty of women everywhere right?
NOIREUTER: ( coldly ) Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
ENZO: It isn't lit yet.
NOIREUTER: You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
ENZO: Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
NOIREUTER: ( stubborn ) The rules are the rules.
ENZO: ( checking out this . What's your name again?
NOIREUTER: And where did you say you were from?
ENZO: And where did you say you were from?
NOIREUTER: I didn't say. ENZO smiles sardonically, shaking his head very slowly. The COMMANDER'S answer explains it all.
TECHNICIAN: They're at 450 feet.
ENZO: . I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name! Let me tell you, time erases everything!
JACQUES: I don't want to erase anything.
ENZO: You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
JACQUES: ( after thinking about . Yes.
ENZO: ( smiles ) I give you this. You're stubborn. Dumb, but stubborn.
JACQUES: ( taking it as a Thank you.
TECHNICIAN: Minus 800 feet. End of descent.
NOIREUTER: ( with a Mickey Mouse You have enough air for 15 minutes. ENZO bursts out laughing.
ENZO: ( with Donald Ducks What's with the voice?
NOIREUTER: It's nothing. It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
ENZO: ( worried ) And. does the voice come back?
NOIREUTER: For others, yes. For you, who Try speaking to me?
ENZO: ( still a little Try speaking to me?
JACQUES: ( with Daffy Ducks I don't find this funny. We were having a serious conversation. ENZO and JACQUES burst out laughing. They keep these same voice till the end of the scene. ENZO pulls out a tiny silver flask out of his pocket.
ENZO: ( to Jacques ) Here, give me your finger. ENZO taps a drop onto JACQUES' finger, then on his own. Then NOIREUTER blows up.
NOIREUTER: ( in a panic ) Is that alcohol? Are you out of your mind? Alcohol is strictly ( loosing his temper ) Hey! D'you have any other complaints? Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! ENZO pours a second drop on his own finger.
ENZO: ( loosing his temper ) Hey! D'you have any other complaints? Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! ENZO pours a second drop on his own finger.
ENZO: Go on, suck your finger. JACQUES hesitates. ENZO has no qualms about it and sucks his own finger. NOIREUTER is petrified.
NOIREUTER: Are you crazy? At this pressure?
JACQUES: It's very deep down here.
ENZO: Come on, suck your finger, you'll be seeing mermaids everywhere! JACQUES, convinced sucks his finger too. ENZO smiles. The alcohol has an immediate effect on them.
ENZO: ( to Jacques ) A thousand commanders and we get a Belgian from Alcoholic's Anonymous.
UNDERWATER: ENZO gets out of the diving capsule, head first. He is connected to the capsule by a number of cables. JACQUES, who follows him, gets completely tangled up in them. They are both hilariously drunk.
SUPERINTENDENT: Can you hear me? What's going on? Are you sure you're on the right The technician nods back to him.
UNDERWATER: The two divers have gotten to the spot they are supposed to be working on. They have their arms around each other and are dancing. NOIREUTER watches them through the porthole. He shakes his head in complete disbelief.
SUPERINTENDENT: If those guys are playing a radio down there they'd just better watch INT. JOHANA'S APARTMENT SALLY is talking away, pointing around the apartment.
SALLY: . And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express. for the couch there's Bloomingdales. or are you still over your limit?
JOHANA: ( flatly ) Way past it.
SALLY: Does that have a hidden meaning?
JOHANA: No. I'm just depressed.
SALLY: You look it too. You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins! You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't I know, I know! I'm a terrible It's. I'm so damn, damn sad.
JOHANA: ( stopping her ) I know, I know! I'm a terrible ( after a beat ) It's. I'm so damn, damn sad.
SALLY: What is it honey. the frenchy?
JOHANA: ( tentatively ) Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed? I've been a jerk, right? ( then, emphatically ) I should have stayed! I was supposed to be in love. I was in love! I am in love, why did I act like a bitch? He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy. It was too good to be true.
SALLY: Vitamins, exercise, herb tea. and see a doctor, will ya?
DOCTOR: Well Miss Cross, herbs aren't going to do the trick this time.
JOHANA: ( worried ) It's serious, right?
DOCTOR: I think so. You're pregnant. Congratulations! If that's in JOHANA breaks into a wide grin.
JOHANA: It's in order! Thank you. Thank I don't think it's me you have to INT. DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - DAY DUFFY is at his desk. His lunch is spread out in front of him. Outside the window, the window-washers are eating their lunch too. JOHANA hurries in.
DOCTOR: I don't think it's me you have to INT. DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - DAY DUFFY is at his desk. His lunch is spread out in front of him. Outside the window, the window-washers are eating their lunch too. JOHANA hurries in.
DUFFY: Good afternoon.
JOHANA: ( agitated ) I came to make a clean breast of everything. the whole business.
DUFFY: ( bluffing, with his Yes. Of course. Very wise.
JOHANA: ( in a rush ) Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium. Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me. ( she sees the window- . Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with. and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get. of course just now I don't have. ( she checks a note One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars. But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even. and I think this is where you fire me?
DUFFY: ( swallowing sandwich ) You're right. You're fired.
JOHANA: Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave? I'm pregnant.
DUFFY: The Italian, I presume?
JOHANA: No. He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
DUFFY: ( smiling ) He seems to have won it.
JOHANA: Yes, isn't it wonderful? I'm so happy. I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world! She starts to leave. calls out to the window-washers.
JOHANA: Bon appetit and Adieu!
JOHANA: It's me. Johana.
JACQUES: How are you?
JOHANA: I got fired.
LATER: JOHANA is still on the phone, sitting in front of the bay window. Day is dawning.
JOHANA: ( looking out at the It's getting light out.
JACQUES: I've been thinking about you a lot, you know. JOHANA is by now completely stretched out on the floor.
JOHANA: So have I. . Hello?
JACQUES: I'm still here.
JOHANA: Well, then, talk to me some more.
JACQUES: . It's hard you know. You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
JOHANA: Then, tell me a story.
JACQUES: Uh. Ah! A story? He turns around and sits on the window sill, his feet dangling in mid air. He looks at the sea, seeking inspiration.
JACQUES: Do you know how it is? Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
JOHANA: ( with a smile ) No. tell me.
JACQUES: You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory. and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there. and you decide that you will die for them. Only then do they start coming out. They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them. If it's sincere. If it's pure. They will be with you and take you away forever. JOHANA listens with the abandon of a child being put to INT. JACQUES' ROOM - ANTIBES The sun hits the roof tops. The sea is sparkling. The phone rings on the window sill. JACQUES answers.
JACQUES: JOHANA ( V.O. ) It's me again. JACQUES smiles.
JOHANA: ( after a silence ) I'm being a pain, huh?
JACQUES: . Not at all.
JACQUES: ( smiling ) Absolutely positive.
JACQUES: ( lost ) Okay. huh, I'll be right over.
DRIVER: ( loud ) The Carlton! Enjoy your siesta. JACQUES and JOHANA look at each other.
JOHANA: ( a little frightened ) Are you okay? After a long beat.
JACQUES: . I think I love you.
JOHANA: Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
JACQUES: You'll understand. JACQUES rings the door bell and sticks his key in the Someone in there? JACQUES nods and pushes the door open with the bags he's carrying. They enter a huge, very old apartment filled with models and paintings of boats. JACQUES leads JOHANA to the other end of the apartment.
JOHANA: ( surprised ) Someone in there? JACQUES nods and pushes the door open with the bags he's carrying. They enter a huge, very old apartment filled with models and paintings of boats. JACQUES leads JOHANA to the other end of the apartment.
JACQUES: Don't be afraid. It's my Uncle. He goes to the tub and pinches the end of a tube. UNCLE LOUIS, underwater, has been breathing through it. LOUIS' head pops out of the water, furious.
UNCLE LOUIS: ( loud, as if speaking Uncle Louis, this is my friend UNCLE LOUIS Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz?
JACQUES: ( loud, as if speaking Uncle Louis, this is my friend UNCLE LOUIS Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz?
UNCLE LOUIS: Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz?
JACQUES: I brought Johana to meet you.
UNCLE LOUIS: Are you crazy? I have no use for a woman! Since my accident.
JACQUES: No, no. Johana is visiting me.
JOHANA: ( tentatively ) Bonjour Monsieur. Louis. ( she looks to
JACQUES: ( whispering to Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
JOHANA: I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Did you bring the cassettes, the Wagner, the Berlioz? This idiot never listens to anything I say. Sometimes I wonder if he isn't deaf. LOUIS climbs out of the bathtub, and pulls on a bathrobe. Behind him he's pulling two insulated wires out of the bathtub. We see that they're connected to small underwater speakers. As they surface, incredibly LOUD MUSIC BLASTS: the finale of the "1812 Overture", ( trumpets, timpani, cannons, etc. ) The sound fills the room, the apartment, and probably all of ANTIBES.

UNCLE LOUIS: Where are you from, Henrietta?
JACQUES: ( correcting him ) Johana. New York.
UNCLE LOUIS: What kind of name is that? To be named after a city?
JACQUES: ( smiling ) He doesn't hear too well.
JOHANA: ( yelling ) I said I was from New York.
UNCLE LOUIS: ( yelling at Jacques ) That explains it! The best lays are from New York!
JACQUES: Uncle Louis!
UNCLE LOUIS: No, no. It's true. When I was in New York, oh boy! Before my accident, you understand? JACQUES stands up and lowers the music.
JACQUES: ( impatient ) Uncle Louis! Johana is my friend. She's come to stay with me for a UNCLE LOUIS Good. That way I'll see more of you. Where are you going to stay?
UNCLE LOUIS: Good. That way I'll see more of you. Where are you going to stay?
JACQUES: Well. here.
UNCLE LOUIS: ( outraged ) In my apartment?
JACQUES: ( with a sigh ) It's my apartment.
UNCLE LOUIS: ( jumping up ) Liar! Thief! Torturer! When you were an orphan I nursed you at my Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
JACQUES: Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
UNCLE LOUIS: I'm going to put a lock on the Did you bring the cassettes?
JACQUES: ( solicitously ) You think it'll be all right? You'll be comfortable here?
JOHANA: ( catching her breath ) It's going to be. interesting.
ROBERTO: ( glancing at his . It's not like him to be late. Of course sometimes he doesn't show up at all. Once in Capri, he.
JOHANA: ( interrupting ) We get the picture, Roberto. ( looks over her Jacques, I think Louis needs help. JACQUES turns around. UNCLE LOUIS is a few yards behind them at a fish stand on the dock. He's holding up an eel and screaming at the fishmonger.
UNCLE LOUIS: ( yelling ) Two dollars for this! This fish wasn't caught. It died of cancer! JACQUES shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of ( pointing ) Here he comes! A speed boat races along the water. It's a beautiful highly-varnished mahogany Riva. It races into the port. Standing at the helm, looking like Christopher Columbus his hair brushed back by the wind, is ENZO. Next to him hanging on to the windscreen is an impressive six foot, dark haired beauty. She has a scarf over her hair. She wears a purple leather micro-mini with a cerise halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long. If she ever actually would get cast in a movie, she'd make Raquel Welch hide in shame. Her stage name is BONITA

ENZO: Jacques! Johana!
JOHANA: During all of this, everyone's attention is actually on BONITA who is tugging at her long black hair. They're all awestruck except for ROBERTO.
JACQUES: During all of this, everyone's attention is actually on BONITA who is tugging at her long black hair. They're all awestruck except for ROBERTO.
ROBERTO: ( meaning the speed Where did you get that?
ENZO: ( meaning Bonita ) "That"! This is not a "that". This is Bonita Mariposa, the famous Spanish actress. ( whispering to . Who is going to be careful with the varnish. ( back to Roberto ) And who has come to spend a few days with us. ( and very quickly ) Where's Mamma?
ROBERTO: ( checking watch ) You have eight hours before she gets ENZO glances at his watch and sighs with relief. BONITA says hello to JACQUES, kisses JOHANA.
ENZO: He's really going totally deaf!
UNCLE LOUIS: I'm not as deaf as you are blind, my boy! You take care of your eyes, I'll take care of my ears!
ENZO: ( laughing ) I'm sorry Uncle Louis. UNCLE LOUIS pours him a whiskey.
UNCLE LOUIS: Come on, drink up, my boy! It might just save us from your bullshit. The bottle is empty. UNCLE LOUIS goes to the kitchen. JACQUES turns down the music, and finally hears the bell which has been ringing. JACQUES opens the apartment door: it's Professor LAWRENCE. Suit and tie and carrying a I'm glad you could come. I want you to meet Enzo. ENZO and LAWRENCE shake hands.
JACQUES: I'm glad you could come. I want you to meet Enzo. ENZO and LAWRENCE shake hands.
LAWRENCE: ( with a smile ) So you're the famous Enzo Molinari?
ENZO: ( with an even bigger In the flesh. I have that honor!
BONITA: You're going to live here . Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little. JOHANA walks over to the mirror and watches BONITA put on her make-up like a professional.
JOHANA: . Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little. JOHANA walks over to the mirror and watches BONITA put on her make-up like a professional.
BONITA: ( wistfully ) He's shy, not like Enzo.
JOHANA: Yes. Not like Enzo.
BONITA: ( putting on I think, he's really nice. He's a funny guy. sometimes even very ( after a long . I'm pregnant, Bonita! BONITA stops working on her make-up and looks pensively at
JOHANA: ( after a long . I'm pregnant, Bonita! BONITA stops working on her make-up and looks pensively at
BONITA: Are you going to keep it?
JOHANA: Does he know?
BONITA: Does he know?
JOHANA: ( thinking ) Maybe you should talk to him about I can't. I just don't know how BONITA looks at her with the same pensive look. JOHANA goes on.
BONITA: ( thinking ) Maybe you should talk to him about I can't. I just don't know how BONITA looks at her with the same pensive look. JOHANA goes on.
JOHANA: I can't. I just don't know how BONITA looks at her with the same pensive look. JOHANA goes on.
JOHANA: I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night. You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods. Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan. Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
BONITA: ( starts laughing ) But your man isn't quite a God!
JOHANA: ( smiles ) Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
BONITA: Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime! Unconvinced, JOHANA nods. She changes the subject.
JOHANA: And you.? Do you love Enzo?
BONITA: ( earnestly ) Very much, I think. ( a beat ) But, there's going to be a problem.
ROBERTO: ( desperately ) Mamma, calimari fritti. Zuppa de pesci. Sono buoni.
MAMMA MOLINARI: ( eyeing Bonita ) Nothing. I'm not hungry.
ENZO: Mamma, Bonita is an actress like Sophia Loren, Anna Magnani.
BONITA: ( icy ) Sarah Bernardt. I sing too. a hell of a Carmen. Want to hear?
MAMMA MOLINARI: ( coldly ) No thank you. There's an interminable awkward silence. Then UNCLE LOUIS at last finds his way to the table. JACQUES who is too grateful for the interruption springs to his feet.
JACQUES: Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from The whale! How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman! MAMMA MOLINARI is having trouble breathing.
UNCLE LOUIS: ( screaming ) The whale! How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman! MAMMA MOLINARI is having trouble breathing.
UNCLE LOUIS: What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
JACQUES: Louis, we were French!
UNCLE LOUIS: That's different! What's the matter with you?
ROBERTO: ( complete panic ) Mamma, pesce di spada? All of them are gasping for air, trying so hard not to UNCLE LOUIS ( to Mamma ) Hey, whale! Can you pass down the They all burst out laughing.
UNCLE LOUIS: ( to Mamma ) Hey, whale! Can you pass down the They all burst out laughing.
ENZO: A shit dive. He looks around angrily for an official. Sees NOVELLI.
ENZO: Those goddamned frogmen doctors waiting around at 200 feet they just kill your concentration.
NOVELLI: They're required by law.
ENZO: ( climbing off There's no law down there! The only law is what your lungs can take. ( to the next diver ) . Have fun! They waiting for you down there, to take the temperature of your ass. He keeps on walking across the boat, runs into JACQUES, who's just about to begin his yoga preparation. JACQUES sees ENZO'S expression, looks concerned.
ENZO: ( defensively ) Anybody can have a bad day!
JACQUES: I've had many. when the sea doesn't want you.
ENZO: ( disgusted ) It's never the sea! It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress. Oh shit! Jacques, what do you know? Go do your Hindu exercises and don't break my balls! ENZO stamps into one of the cabins.
JOHANA: Well, how was it? In an involuntary gesture, JACQUES flips through the Enzo had a bad day. JOHANA wonders if JACQUES will understand the presence of the baby magazine.
JACQUES: ( sadly ) Enzo had a bad day. JOHANA wonders if JACQUES will understand the presence of the baby magazine.
JOHANA: ( tense ) And you?
JACQUES: I didn't dive.
JOHANA: ( she takes the You'll try again tomorrow?
JACQUES: I don't know. it didn't feel right. I'm going to bed. I'm tired. He goes away.
JOHANA: You forgot your magazine! He hasn't heard. JACQUES goes to the bedroom, and throws himself on the JOHANA looks as if she had wished he'd put two and two . Nothing.
JACQUES: . Nothing.
JOHANA: . Nothing.
ENZO: Let them try.
BONITA: I wanted to say goodbye, Johana. They kiss each other goodbye. JOHANA is very uncomfortable.
JOHANA: You're leaving?
BONITA: ( she hands her a Could you please give this to Enzo.
JOHANA: Of course. BONITA grabs the note back and tears it up.
BONITA: It's no use. Just tell him I said goodbye. And give him a kiss for me, Okay? The two women hug again.
JOHANA: ( sorry ) Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
BONITA: I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma. Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier. BONITA rests her hand on JOHANA'S stomach.
BONITA: Did you tell him?
JOHANA: Not yet. I'm waiting for the right . You take care of yourself, BONITA smiles at her and disappears down the stairs.
BONITA: . You take care of yourself, BONITA smiles at her and disappears down the stairs.
JACQUES: ( smiling ) Good huh?
LAWRENCE: He really was unbelievable, 328 feet, deeper than the world . And, Jacques! He held his breath for four minutes and fifty Good. I guess I have tomorrow's work cut out for me as Enzo would You must be very careful, Jacques. At these depths, to hold your breath for over five minutes is. You'd really be pushing it. I think it's very, very dangerous. JACQUES sees ENZO being carried past on the shoulders of the crowd. He ignores LAWRENCE, runs beside ENZO.
JACQUES: ( smiles too ) Good. I guess I have tomorrow's work cut out for me as Enzo would ( seriously ) You must be very careful, Jacques. At these depths, to hold your breath for over five minutes is. You'd really be pushing it. I think it's very, very dangerous. JACQUES sees ENZO being carried past on the shoulders of the crowd. He ignores LAWRENCE, runs beside ENZO.

JACQUES: ( yelling ) Enzo, Enzo! Congratulations!
ENZO: ( in answer to the Thank you, thank you very much! ENZO and NOVELLI stand on a little stage facing the crowd. ENZO is holding a gold trophy, waving to friends in the . Now I'm sure you've heard that some people have suggested it is too dangerous for us to continue. Dangerous, because we don't know how to measure the physiological consequences of this type of dive and also because the scuba divers are not used to going down below 300 While the attentive crowd listens to NOVELLI, ENZO is gesturing to ROBERTO, explaining what appetizers he wants from the cocktail trays. The crowd laughs.
NOVELLI: . Now I'm sure you've heard that some people have suggested it is too dangerous for us to continue.

The crowd laughs.
NOVELLI: But, we polled the free divers and they insist that the competition There's wild applause. ENZO lifts the trophy over his head, smiles like a champ and yells into the microphone.
ENZO: ( yelling ) Good luck to you all!
ENZO: ( smiling to his Fabulous, what a dive, huh? ROBERTO smiles. The diver from the Philippines stands at the end of the diving platform. He concentrates for a moment then gives up and walks away.
ENZO: He's right. What's the point of knocking yourself out?
JOHANA: ( softly ) What are you doing?
JACQUES: I'm putting you on the coin. Your essence. That way you'll always be with me when I dive. She smiles, closes her eyes. He swings the coin over her face gently, some kind of private ceremony. She looks just a little intimidated. The coin is now dangling in front of her mouth. She hesitates then opens her mouth, JACQUES lets the coin slide into it.
UNDERWATER: JACQUES dives down very fast. The control takes place at 200 feet, the doctors check him and let him go. He continues his descent, it's getting darker and darker around him. The gueuse stops at the level of the underwater platform, just below the diver, who swims over to him in a sea of bubbles from his oxygen bottles. He asks JACQUES if he is alright, JACQUES nods and gives him a huge smile before swimming off, downwards! The diver realizes and starts after him. He grabs JACQUES by one of his fins and pulls him back to the round platform. JACQUES lets go of the balloon. The diver panics. JACQUES slowly motions that everything is fine and slowly paddles up to the surface.
NOVELLI: ( stunned ) 360 feet! He dove 360 feet!!! The crowd cheers in excitement. ENZO is sullen. LAWRENCE is very worried.
JACQUES: ( pointing at taxi ) . There's a party at the hotel ENZO keeps loading up the boat.
ENZO: ( busy ) That's good.
JACQUES: ( after a beat ) Enzo, don't be angry. I was lucky. that's all. ENZO throws the last duffel bag into the cockpit.
ENZO: ( serious ) I'll see you in Amorgos. ENZO turns around and jumps onto his boat. JACQUES walks off the dock, past the cab. JOHANA opens the door to let him in, but he keeps walking.
JOHANA: You go back, I'll walk. He walks off.
JACQUES: You go back, I'll walk. He walks off.
JACQUES: ( sadly ) I won today. I dove very deep, The dolphin giggles.
JACQUES: What's so funny? Can you dive The dolphin nods "yes". JACQUES smiles.
JACQUES: ( smiling ) So you understand everything? The dolphin nods.
JACQUES: That's good. So tell me why they're all angry at me? Why is Enzo angry? I never wanted to compete with him. I never wanted to be champion of anything. All I want is to escape from them all. For just a few minutes, no people. No noise. Nothing but the sea. The dolphin nods and giggles.
JACQUES: Do you really understand me? Huh? Are we actually having a conversation here? Again the dolphin nods "yes".
JACQUES: All right then, tell me: can I ever dive as deep as you? Stay under as A beat. Then the dolphin nods "yes".
JACQUES: Are you sure? The two other dolphins stick their heads out of the water. They all nod together. JACQUES is awed and perplexed at the same time.
JACQUES: It's beautiful, isn't it? Behind him, JOHANA is hiding and throwing up. He walks to What's wrong?
JACQUES: What's wrong?
JOHANA: It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
JACQUES: You want to lie down for a while?
JOHANA: No, I'll be fine. Can you just hand me a glass of water? While JACQUES gets her the water, JOHANA stares at the EXT. ENZO'S BOAT - IN THE LITTLE PORT ROBERTO stands on the port, waiting for his brother. Suddenly the sound of a motor boat and twelve note horn echoes in the bay. The boat has just arrived at the town dock. ENZO, tears rolling down his cheeks from the wind, throws a duffel bag on the dock and looks up at ROBERTO.
ENZO: Is he here?
ROBERTO: ( uncomfortable ) He's training. ENZO makes a face.
ENZO: Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful What are you doing here?
JOHANA: What are you doing here?
ENZO: Checking out the competition.
JOHANA: Enzo, why do you guys do this?
ENZO: ( teasing ) What else is there?
JOHANA: ( seriously ) You know what I'm talking about. Why do you and Jacques risk your lives diving?
ENZO: ( avoiding the You risk your life when you cross the street.
JOHANA: ( frustrated ) Damn it! Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
ENZO: Because you'd laugh.
JOHANA: I won't, I swear.
ENZO: ( seriously ) I dive in search of God. If I go deep enough I'm going to find him. To me, the sea is a religion. That surprises you, doesn't it?
JOHANA: ( looking down at A little. You think it's the same for Jacques?
ENZO: ( shaking his head ) No. Jacques is a creature of the sea. He isn't meant to live on earth, among us. You should know this, Johana.
JOHANA: ( reassuring herself ) He can learn. He is learning.
ENZO: You really think so? Did you tell him you were pregnant?
JOHANA: ( surprised ) How do you know that?
ENZO: You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right? JOHANA shakes her head negatively.
JOHANA: . Not yet.
ENZO: Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you. Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake. And he's only waiting for one thing: that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
JOHANA: Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you. Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake. And he's only waiting for one thing: that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
ENZO: Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you. Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake. And he's only waiting for one thing: that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
JOHANA: ( looking at the Five minutes and fifty seconds.
ENZO: ( grabbing away the That idiot! They jump up. ENZO dives into the water. As JOHANA watches panicky, ENZO pulls JACQUES up onto the dock, in his arms. JACQUES is unconscious. ENZO is furious. The fear of loosing his friend has absolutely enraged him. He starts pacing up and down the Is he alright? What happened?
JOHANA: Is he alright? What happened?
ENZO: ( furious ) The fool was asleep! If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with? Well, good luck! You better learn to look after him because I won't always be here to do it! Once again he marches off, then comes back.
JACQUES: ( mumbling ) . How long was I asleep?
ENZO: ( to Jacques ) Long enough to die. Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay? A few steps away, then coming back.
ENZO: ( to Jacques ) I'll never let you take away my title. D'you hear me? Never! ENZO stalks off defiantly.
MUSIC: A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS of different competitors at various points in their dives. The Tahitian comes up unconscious. The German comes up unconscious. So does the diver from the Philippines. NOVELLI doesn't know what to think.
JOHANA: Do you ever sometimes just stop and think how sweet life can be? A beat.
JACQUES: . Sure. JOHANA wants to say something.
JOHANA: . When you dive. with that machine. What does it feel like?
JACQUES: ( after thinking about . The feeling of slipping without falling. The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
JOHANA: Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again. And I always have a hard time finding JOHANA has never looked so sad and lost. JACQUES doesn't notice. ENZO who is sitting at the piano behind them, starts to play, staring at the sea. JACQUES and JOHANA turn around and look at him.
JACQUES: Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again. And I always have a hard time finding JOHANA has never looked so sad and lost. JACQUES doesn't notice. ENZO who is sitting at the piano behind them, starts to play, staring at the sea. JACQUES and JOHANA turn around and look at him.
ENZO: ( smiling ) . You should start playing the piano, the piano is really refreshing, it clears the sinuses. Very good the piano! Tomorrow is going to be a big day!
LAWRENCE: . When I analyzed the data from Mayol's last dive, it became . At the depths these men are diving, it is a physiological impossibility that they can retain enough oxygen in their blood to make it back to the surface. It's a function of how long it takes to get to the bottom, orient themselves and to return. To attempt to break Mayol's record is simple suicide. For the last time. I'm telling you cancel the competition. NOVELLI and the MEDIC look over at the diving platform where ENZO is concentrating.
MEDIC: Molinari's a seventeen time world champion. Do you want to tell him he can't dive. LAWRENCE doesn't answer. NOVELLI is thinking.
NOVELLI: Get Mayol in here.
JACQUES: ( no response ) Enzo. I know you're angry at me. ( no response ) Enzo, it's important. ENZO opens one eye.
ENZO: I'm concentrating.
JACQUES: ( quickly ) We can't dive anymore. They want to cancel the competition for a while. ENZO looks at him coldly. Takes another deep breath.
JACQUES: ( rushing on ) It's not safe, they say. The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live. Free diving is over as a sport.
ENZO: You say that because you have the No! I would never cheat you.
JACQUES: No! I would never cheat you.
ENZO: Well that's very nice of you. He takes a last breath, signs himself and reaching for the gueuse, disappears into the water. LAWRENCE, NOVELLI, the MEDICS, and others are arguing. LAWRENCE is furious that ENZO is diving. NOVELLI is balling out his assistants. JACQUES is on the platform watching the others as if they were a gaggle of geese. He listens to the sound of the gueuse playing out, watches the depth indicator, the stopwatches. He knows something is wrong. He walks over to the edge and grabs hold of a little oxygen bottle which is there for security. He takes a few breaths of the oxygen as he puts on his flippers and dives down after ENZO.
ENZO: ( faintly ) You were right.
JACQUES: ( moved ) . I was right about what?
ENZO: ( after a long . It is much better down there. It's a better place. He tries to take a deep breath, the effort is exhausting. JACQUES smiles, holding back his tears.
ENZO: . Push me back in the water.
JACQUES: ( crying ) I can't.
ENZO: Jacques, take me back down. His smile freezes, he stops breathing. His eyes close. JACQUES puts his head down on his friend's chest and sobs. The doctors gently try to move him away, but JACQUES Just give him five minutes! What does it matter now, anyway. Come on, just leave him alone! LAWRENCE encourages everybody to leave the platform. JACQUES quickly grabs the nearest rope and ties it to his belt. Before anybody can stop him, JACQUES rolls ENZO'S body back into the water and dives after it.
LAWRENCE: Just give him five minutes! What does it matter now, anyway. Come on, just leave him alone! LAWRENCE encourages everybody to leave the platform. JACQUES quickly grabs the nearest rope and ties it to his belt. Before anybody can stop him, JACQUES rolls ENZO'S body back into the water and dives after it.
A DOCTOR: ( listening to his The heart is going to stop! The stimulator, quickly. Suddenly, everything collapses for JACQUES. Sounds disappear. The image slows down, the light fades. JACQUES only hears his heartbeat, which slows down. His heart stops. Among the crowd around him, he sees JOHANA, fresh, gentle, smiling. Her movements are smooth and slowed down. She smiles at him, simply. JACQUES smiles back. The heart starts again slowly. The image goes back to normal. Sounds multiply ( doctors, the panic, etc. ) and slowly come back. JACQUES falls unconscious.
A DOCTOR: The heart started again! It's all NOVELLI falls back in his chair, relieved.
LAWRENCE: Take this. Have a good sleep. JACQUES swallows the pills. JOHANA walks over from the Sweet dreams. LAWRENCE motions to JOHANA that they should let him sleep. He goes out of the room.
LAWRENCE: Sweet dreams. LAWRENCE motions to JOHANA that they should let him sleep. He goes out of the room.
JACQUES: ( tenderly to Johana, Kiss me. JOHANA bends over and kisses him. JACQUES holds her by the arm, doesn't want her to leave.
JOHANA: Sleep now. We'll talk later. JOHANA kisses him on the forehead and leaves the room.
ROBERTO: I've packed all of. Enzo's I'm going to the radio telephone. . to call Mamma. They watch sadly as he leaves.
JOHANA: I'll go see how he's doing.
LAWRENCE: Let him sleep.
JOHANA: ( in a panic ) Jacques. Are you alright?
JOHANA: ( still worried ) Jacques? Are you alright? Answer me! Are you alright? She jumps down into ENZO'S boat. He starts the engine. The boat is racing out of the port. JOHANA yells over the sound of the engine.
JOHANA: You've got to tell me what happened?
JACQUES: I saw how it has to be. JACQUES parks the boat in front of the COMMITTEE BOAT'S DIVING PLATFORM. He turns on the platform lights: above and underwater. He throws down the diving cable: 60, 90, 120 feet. JACQUES gets undressed and sits down in the lotus position, concentrating. JOHANA sits down a few feet away and watches him, wondering just how far he is going to push this whole As the cable unrolls, JOHANA starts crying. She understands that JACQUES is going to dive to the bottom, into the blue, into himself.
JOHANA: Jacques, you know I love you. JACQUES is putting on his flippers, and stands facing his Don't be sad. It's not because of you, it's me. It's all going on inside me! I've gotta go and see. JOHANA starts pacing up and down the diving platform.
JACQUES: ( after a silence ) Don't be sad. It's not because of you, it's me. It's all going on inside me! ( a beat ) I've gotta go and see. JOHANA starts pacing up and down the diving platform.
JOHANA: See what? There is nothing to see! It's pitch black down there! It's cold. You'll be all alone! Look at me, Jacques! I am here! I exist! I'm real! I am not a dream! Jacques will you look at me? JACQUES has not moved, he still sits motionless, facing his gueuse. JOHANA doesn't know what to do or say. She is totally Jacques? I'm pregnant.
JOHANA: Jacques? I'm pregnant.
JACQUES: That's good. that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
JOHANA: You are the father. Silence. JACQUES is petrified, without any reaction. He doesn't understand. She realizes it's hopeless and stares at the sea.
JOHANA: ( after a while ) I lied. to keep you here. She kisses him.
JOHANA: Promise me one thing.
JACQUES: Promise you won't forget me. She pulls the line releasing the gueuse. JACQUES takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the gueuse, disappears into the water as if swallowed by the ocean.
JOHANA: Promise you won't forget me. She pulls the line releasing the gueuse. JACQUES takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the gueuse, disappears into the water as if swallowed by the ocean.
UNDERWATER: JACQUES slides along the cable, pulled by the weight of the gueuse. He has a beautiful smile on his face. He is in his element. Night has closed in around him. He turns on the headlight of the gueuse, it casts a dim light around him.
UNDERWATER: JACQUES keeps going down, as serene as ever. He has gained a lot of speed.
UNDERWATER: The gueuse jerks to a stop and shakes the cable. JACQUES turns his body right side up.
UNDERWATER: The headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet around JACQUES, as if he were standing in a circle of light. He stays there, patiently floating around and around his cable. as if he were waiting for something. A long form circles the border between the darkness and the light. JACQUES holds out his hand. A dolphin comes and presses its body against it. Two other dolphins come out of the night. JACQUES watches in amazement. A dolphin lays his muzzle in JACQUES' hand, ready to lead him off. JACQUES hesitates. JACQUES lets go of the cable and lets himself be led away. Their silhouettes disappear in the deep blue night.
