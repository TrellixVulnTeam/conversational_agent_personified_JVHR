BLACK SWAN: Written by
NINA: ( WHILE STRETCHING )
ERICA: You're in a good mood.
NINA: I'm just excited to get back.
ERICA: Off-season always makes you grumpy.
NINA: ( RE: GRAPEFRUIT )
ERICA NINA: ( inside joke ) ( inside joke ) Pretty. Pretty. They giggle and Erica resumes packing Nina's shoulder bag with extra clothing, shoes, snack filled tupperware, duct tape, ribbon, thread, etc.
ERICA: He certainly should. You're the most dedicated dancer in the Nina smiles, comforted, and begins taking her vitamins. Erica walks over with a SWEATSHIRT and holds it above her. Nina pulls it over her head and starts to push her arms through the sleeves.
NINA: Erica points to her shoulder. Nina feels and finds a small
ERICA: Erica points to her shoulder. Nina feels and finds a small
VERONICA: Can't believe she's back.
GALINA: Of course she is.
VERONICA: She can't take a hint? Company's broke. No one comes to see her No one comes to see ballet period.
SOLOIST 1: No one comes to see ballet period.
VERONICA: That's not true, I heard the Royal had one of their best seasons yet.
GALINA: He needs to try something new.
VERONICA: No, someone new.
SOLOIST 1: Like who?
VERONICA: Like someone who's not approaching They snicker.
NINA: I think it's sad.
VERONICA: What's sad?
NINA: Beth's such an amazing dancer.
GALINA: So's my grand-mother.
NINA: Fonteyn danced into her 50's.
VERONICA: ( ROLLING EYES )
NEW GIRL: Wary, the girls mumble mmm-hmm's and nod.
BALLET MISTRESS: To the back, fondu, to the back, plie. Fourth, fourth, and one and fifth, to the back. ( to a corps member ) Like this. Push it. Why can't you do this? Using the mirror, Nina monitors her movements carefully. The mistress surprises her.
LEROY: We all know the story: virginal girl, pure and sweet, trapped in the body of a swan. She desires freedom, but only true love can break the spell. He taps a dancer on the shoulder, she lights up. He walks, then taps another. A selection process of some kind. Nina looks nervous, has an inkling of what it means.
BETH: Nina just shakes her head. Beth scoffs as she slams the door behind her. She clips down the hall in the opposite direction. Nina waits until she's gone, then moves closer to the door and peeks inside, curious. She checks to make sure no one's around and quickly enters.
LEROY: So Nina, would you like to be the Swan Queen?
NINA: If you want me to be. He leans in and talks softly so the other girls can't hear.
LEROY: Well, if I was just casting the White Swan, she'd be yours. She can't help but smile, flattered. He pulls away from her.
NEW GIRL: Girls, this is Lily. Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot. LILY gives a small wave. Nina eyes her with scorn as she catches her breath.
LEROY: Girls, this is Lily. Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot. LILY gives a small wave. Nina eyes her with scorn as she catches her breath.
LILY: I'm good. Lily starts stripping off her layers, revealing her lithe body. On her back, she has a TATTOO OF LILIES.
NINA: Should I go again?
LEROY: ( distracted by Lily ) I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina. She looks down, getting his meaning.
ERICA: How did it go? Nina looks at her confused. Erica helps take off her coat.
NINA: It went okay.
ERICA: Just okay? Erica hangs up her coat, turns and sees Nina tearing up.
NINA: She winces in pain and automatically grabs her foot.
NINA: I'm fine! Nina leans her back against the mirror and removes her shoe. Her right big toenail has split, oozing blood. Nina breathes through the pain and puts her shoe back on. She reassumes the position, takes a couple breaths, and starts spinning again. Her toe jabs into the floor. She winces a little with pain, but keeps pushing. Her face grows more determined, focused. 20, 21, 22 spins.. She starts to look powerful, willing herself to succeed.
ERICA: Shhh. Almost done.You're working yourself too hard. We all have off If that girl hadn't barged in.
NINA: If that girl hadn't barged in.
ERICA: I'm sure she didn't mean to. Remember when you started? If I hadn't taken you to each of your classes, you would have been completely lost.
NINA: I'm gonna talk to him. Tell him I finished it.
ERICA: He knows you can do the coda. It won't convince him one way or the Annoyed, Nina lies down, looking away from her mother.
NINA: I know, mom.
ERICA: Everything will be better in the morning. It always is. She strokes Nina's hair, humming along to the music. Nina watches the ballerina spin and spin with a determined 21 INT. SUBWAY - DAY 21 Nina applies the lipstick she stole from Beth, using the side window as a mirror. The jerky motion of the train makes it difficult, but she manages.
LEROY: Yes, Nina?
NINA: Do you have a minute? He doesn't answer, just opens the door to the office and walks in. She takes a breath and then follows.
NINA: If now's not a good time.
LEROY: Now's fine, what is it?
NINA: I just wanted to tell you, I practiced the coda last night, and I did it.
LEROY: How thrilling for you.
NINA: ( THROWN )
LEROY: Okay, Nina, listen, I honestly don't care about your technique, you should know that by now.
NINA: Yes, but-
LEROY: Anyway, I've already chosen Veronica, so. He lifts his hands in the air, "there you go."
NINA: ( DEVASTATED )
LEROY: You're not going to try and change my mind? She looks back at him, uncertain. Leroy nonchalantly stubs out his cigarette.
NINA: ( UNSURE )
LEROY: That all? She doesn't know what he means. He comes around his desk and approaches her.
NINA: I can be the Black Swan too.
LEROY: Really? She's hungry, volatile. In four years, every time you dance, I see you obsess over getting each move exactly right, but I never see you lose yourself. Insecure, she looks like she wants to run out of the room.
NINA: I want to be perfect. He laughs.
LEROY: Perfection's not just about control. It's also about letting go. Surprising the audience. Surprising yourself. Transcendence. He considers her for a moment.
NINA: Without warning, he slowly plants a kiss on her mouth. It lasts for a moment, but he suddenly jerks away.
LEROY: Ow! Fuck! He touches his lip, stunned.
NINA: ( MUMBLED )
VERONICA: ( IRKED )
NINA: Veronica turns around. It's hard, but Nina decides to be a good loser.
NINA: ( CONFUSED )
VERONICA: Fuck you. Veronica storms away. The group of girls stares at Nina, making her very self- Nina tentatively approaches the bulletin board, to see what Veronica's outburst was all about. First a few, then more and more of the girls smile at her. They make room for her as she pushes through. She finally gets to the CASTING NOTICE, finds "Swan Queen"
NINA SAYERS: Stunned, she turns around to face the mass of ballerinas. She sees Lily eyeing her with a flat expression, which turns into a smile to mask her disappointment. The other girls start congratulating and hugging Nina, some more sincerely than others.
NINA: Hey.Everything's fine.He picked me, mommy. She waits for a response.
NINA: Nina looks around, puzzled she isn't there.
ERICA: My daughter, the Swan Queen. She opens her arms and Nina falls into a hug. She looks at the cake. It has a ballerina sketched with frosting. Nina hides her disdain.
NINA: Oh, mom.
ERICA: It's our favorite, vanilla with strawberry filling. Erica picks up a knife and slices into the cake.
NINA: Just a little piece. Erica ignores her and starts cutting a very large piece.
ERICA: It's a celebration.
NINA: My stomach's still in knots.
ERICA: ( OFFENDED )
NINA: ( GUILTY )
ERICA: I'm just so proud of you. Erica lifts the slice onto a plate.
NINA: It looks yummy.
NINA: Yeah.good luck finding a spot.
DAVID: I am David.
NINA: I know you are. I'm Nina.
DAVID: Yes. Here we go, huh? She nods, nervous.
LEROY: The music stops. Nina breaks out of character and looks at Leroy, anxious for his reaction. The Russian ballet mistress nods and smiles, clearly pleased.
NINA: I saw a flash of her yesterday. Get ready to show me more of that bite. He gives her an impish smirk. She looks down, embarrassed.
LEROY: I saw a flash of her yesterday. Get ready to show me more of that bite. He gives her an impish smirk. She looks down, embarrassed.
SUSIE: You share with Beth from now on, so be considerate.
NINA: Thanks, Susie. Awed, Nina looks around the room. She scans Beth's photographs and personal belongings, and lands on a large bouquet of FRESH FLOWERS.
SUSIE: Those are for you. From Mr. Leroy.
NINA: Susie leaves. Nina pulls a card out from the flowers and reads. A faint smile curls her lips. She opens her shoulder bag and removes a SMALL SATCHEL. She pulls out a pair of DIAMOND STUD EARRINGS and puts them on.
LEROY: Ready to be thrown to the wolves? We need their cash, so smile. She smiles, as instructed.
LEROY: Dr. Brinson and his lovely wife, Ellen, tonight's sponsors. She shakes DR. BRINSON'S hand and curtseys to MRS. BRINSON.
NINA: Such a beautiful event.
MRS. BRINSON: Not as beautiful as you, dear. Nina demurs. They're replaced by another HUSBAND and WIFE.
LEROY: And this is Mr. and Mrs. Stein. Nina repeats the pleasantries, this time noticing that one of her cuticles is bleeding. She awkwardly pulls her hand away. Leroy leans in and whispers in her ear.
NINA: Just a second. She turns off the water and wipes her damp hands on the back of her neck, trying to cool herself. She checks her finger. No blood, but there's a HANGNAIL. Nina takes hold of the small flap and tries to yank it off. Accidentally tearing a strip of skin from the nail to her second knuckle. More KNOCKING startles her.
NINA: ( RATTLED )
LILY: Our New Swan Queen! That is so huge! You must be freaking out.
NINA: Lily slides her PANTIES out from under her dress and puts them in her clutch.
LILY: Stay. Keep me company. Lily starts to refresh her makeup. Nina stays put for a second, uncertain.
NINA: Excuse me.
NINA: I think I drank too much. All those You did well.
LEROY: You did well.
NINA: They tried to eat you alive, but here you are, in one piece.
LEROY: They tried to eat you alive, but here you are, in one piece.
NINA: ( MELTING )
LEROY: I'll get you a cab. Where you Oh, Upper West Side.
NINA: Oh, Upper West Side.
LEROY: Why don't you come to my place first? It's on the way. She gives him a coy glance, reading between the lines and hiding her excitement.
NINA: No, that's good. He starts to look for a cab.
LEROY: ( TO NINA )
NINA: ( CONCERNED )
BETH: What'd you do to get the role?
NINA: Some of us don't need to do that. Nina's struck a nerve. Beth starts to come at her.
BETH: You fucking little whore.
NINA: ( GUILTY )
BETH: I need to talk to you.
LEROY: You're drunk. You should go home.
BETH: Don't do that! Don't just dismiss Poor, poor little princess. Try to hold it together.
LEROY: ( EXASPERATED )
BETH: I'm going to drop by later, okay? I have something I want to give you.
LEROY: ( IGNORING HER )
NINA: She looks up at him, expecting him to make a move. Instead, he walks away, and sits in a chair. He gestures for her to sit as well. Confused, she sits across from him, alone on the large couch. He takes an unceremonious sip of his drink and studies her. Uncomfortable, she takes a drink as well.
LEROY: I thought it'd be good to talk about the role. Ground us a little.
NINA: The better we get to know each other, the more productive we'll be. I don't want there to be any boundaries between us.
LEROY: The better we get to know each other, the more productive we'll be. I don't want there to be any boundaries between us.
NINA: Me neither.
LEROY: Good. So, do you have a boyfriend? She's caught off guard by his question and just smiles uncomfortably. He waits for an answer. Finally she manages a Have you had many in the past?
NINA: Have you had many in the past?
LEROY: Have you had many in the past?
NINA: A few. But no one serious.
LEROY: You're not a virgin, are you? Her expression sours at this line of questioning. She shakes her head.
NINA: Excuse me?
LEROY: Sex. Do you enjoy it? Blushing and feeling awkward, she takes a sip of champagne.
NINA: Nina looks at him, embarrassed, and shrugs. He smirks, and joins her on the couch.
LEROY: Nina looks at him, embarrassed, and shrugs. He smirks, and joins her on the couch.
NINA: Go home and masturbate. Live a She blanches, scandalized. He finishes off his scotch and It's late. Lots of work tomorrow. The doorman will find you a cab. He leaves her alone in the living room.
LEROY: Go home and masturbate. Live a She blanches, scandalized. He finishes off his scotch and It's late. Lots of work tomorrow. The doorman will find you a cab. He leaves her alone in the living room.
ERICA: Sounds like quite an evening. Wish I could have been there.
NINA: You know I asked.
ERICA: I know, Susie told me. Guess he wanted you all to himself.
NINA: That's not why. Erica looks adoringly at Nina's reflection in the mirror.
ERICA: I don't blame him. Erica starts to remove Nina's DIAMOND EARRINGS, but pauses.
NINA: They're fake.
ERICA: Fooled me. Erica removes the earrings, then walks behind Nina to unzip her. Nina faces her.
NINA: I can do it.
ERICA: Nina turns back around, reticent.
NINA: It's just a rash. Erica gruffly pulls Nina to the mirror and turns her around.
ERICA: What are you talking about? Nina checks her reflection and sees the RASH, red and irritated from scratching.
NINA: It was worse a couple days ago. It's already getting better.
ERICA: You've been scratching again.
NINA: Erica yanks her out of the room.
ERICA: I thought you'd outgrown this disgusting habit.( click ) You haven't done it for years. ( click )
NINA: Mom, please. Erica grabs Nina's other hand.
ERICA: It's the role, isn't it? All this pressure. I was worried it'd be too much. Nina stares at her, seething.
ERICA: Don't be mad at me. You know I love you, you know I want what's best. But we have to take care of you. Nina doesn't respond. Erica opens the JEWELRY BOX and the tinny music begins She hums and starts to stroke Nina's hair. Nina tries to brush her hand away. But Erica brings it back and keeps stroking.
NINA: What happened?
LEROY: She walked into the street, got hit by a car.
NINA: Oh my god.
LEROY: I'm sure she did it on purpose.
NINA: How do you know?
LEROY: Everything Beth ever did came from within. From some dark impulse. It's what could make her so thrilling to watch. Even perfect at times. But also destructive. Nina hesitates, but has to ask.
NINA: Was it right after we saw her?
LEROY: It's not your problem. This has nothing to do with you. She looks away, not so sure.
OLDER NURSE: You can go in.
NINA: It's okay. The older nurse gives her a skeptical glance and continues on her rounds. Nina walks a little further and leans against the wall to She hears the sound of shuffling feet, looks over, and sees the group of people exit the room and walk down the hall, comforting one another. Nina steps out from hiding and goes inside.
OLDER NURSE: What are you doing?! Nina doesn't have an answer. She just stumbles out the door.
LEROY: No, no, not so stiff. Don't be scared of him. She pulls away from David, not at all coyly. Leroy exhales, 48B INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - ANOTHER DAY 48B Nina and David dance the next part of the section, looking more worn out.
LEROY: Forget about control. I want to see She still looks tense, not getting it.
LEROY: David, answer me this question: are you interested in fucking her? David snickers, embarrassed, shakes his head.
DAVID: Have fun. David and the Piano Player leave them alone. 49C Leroy approaches Nina and takes her hands in his. 49C
LEROY: I'll be the Prince. Made nervous by his touch, she nods. He walks behind her and puts his hands on her waist. He starts humming the score. And then they begin. They do a series of lifts and spins, Leroy bracing her. He lets go, she moves away from him.
LEROY: Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me! He grabs her wrist. She spins. He lets go. He grabs her other wrist, she spins to face him. They get very close. Just before they kiss she dips, pulls away.
NINA: Please don't. He ignores her and walks out of the room.
NINA: Who's that? Lily emerges from the darkness, dressed to leave.
LILY: You okay?
NINA: I'm fine.
LILY: You sure? 50B Lily sits down beside her, oblivious of Nina's desire 50B to be left alone. She digs out a cigarette from her bag. Offers it to Nina. Nina doesn't take it.
NINA: We can't smoke in here.
LILY: I won't tell if you won't.
NINA: Nina wipes off her tears with her hand.
LILY: So, want to talk about it?
NINA: Just had a hard day.
LILY: Leroy play too rough? Nina looks at her surprised.
NINA: He's brilliant.
LILY: Sure, but not exactly warm and You don't know him. Lily smirks with a realization.
NINA: You don't know him. Lily smirks with a realization.
LILY: Someone's hot for teacher. Nina gives her a withering glance.
NINA: I should go. It's getting late.
LILY: Hey, I was only playing. Nina walks towards the door.
NINA: I'll be out in a second. She stays still, hoping she won't try to come in. Footsteps recede and Nina breathes. She runs her hands under some water to clean off the blood.
LEROY: Try it again. They resume dancing. She finishes, out of breath, and looks at Leroy and the Russian ballet mistress.
NINA: Do you have any corrections?
LEROY: She doesn't understand. He gets up from his chair and goes to Nina looks away. Can't believe Lily talked to him.
NINA: I didn't tell her that.
LEROY: Maybe you'd like a break for a day or two.
NINA: Or a fucking month.
LEROY: Or a fucking month.
NINA: She shouldn't have said anything!
LEROY: I don't care! You shouldn't be whining to her!
NINA: I didn't.
LEROY: You could be brilliant. Taking it easy would be a betrayal. He walks away from her.
NINA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
LEROY: Stop saying that! Stop being so damn weak! He tosses his chair across the room. SMASHING into the wall.
VERONICA: ( RESENTFUL )
NINA: Lily, I need to talk to you.
LILY: ( you're in trouble ) The other girls giggle.
NINA: ( you're in trouble ) The other girls giggle.
VERONICA: ( you're in trouble ) The other girls giggle.
LILY: Shut up. And they do.
LILY: What's wrong?
NINA: You told Thomas about last night? Lily falters, guilty.
LILY: I ran into him this morning. He said you guys were having some Why would he talk to you?
NINA: Why would he talk to you?
LILY: Whoa your highness, I just told him you're working your ass off and I'm sure you'll be great.
NINA: You shouldn't have done that.
LILY: I didn't fucking do anything. Lily takes off. Nina stares after her, at a loss.
ERICA: Has he tried anything with you? Nina doesn't respond.
NINA: He's not.
ERICA: Good. I don't want you making the same mistake I did.
NINA: ( INSULTED )
ERICA: Not like that. I just mean as far as my career was concerned.
NINA: What career?
ERICA: The one I gave up to have you.
NINA: You were 28.
ERICA: And only. Nina bites her tongue.
NINA: And only. Nina bites her tongue.
ERICA: Only what?

NINA: It's fine.
ERICA: We leaving it alone?
NINA: Let me see. Nina stares back defiantly.
ERICA: Let me see. Nina stares back defiantly.
NINA: Erica starts to come towards her. The DOORBELL RINGS. Erica looks at Nina questioningly. Nina shakes her head.
ERICA: ( to person outside ) Can I help you? ( pause ) I'm sorry, she's not in. Erica shuts the door. Nina rushes out to see who it was.
NINA: Who was it? Erica doesn't answer. Irritated, Nina walks around Erica and quickly opens the door to find out.
ERICA: It's no one.
NINA: Lily turns.
LILY: ( SUSPICIOUS )
NINA: ( SUSPICIOUS )
LILY: I wanted to apologize. Nina just stares, incredulous.
ERICA: Give me a second.
NINA: Give me a second.
ERICA: Your dinner.
NINA: Mom, please! Erica closes the door.
LILY: She's a trip.
NINA: How did you know where I live?
LILY: I have my ways. Nina looks at her, darkly.
NINA: I don't think-
LILY: A drink? Nina's tempted. Erica pokes her head out again.
ERICA: Sweetie, you need to rest.
LILY: Nina pushes the elevator call button.
NINA: ( TO LILY )
ERICA: What are you doing?
NINA: I'm going out.
ERICA: Nina ignores her and shuts the door.
NINA: ( TO LILY )
LILY: Can't believe that's what he called her. So gross!
NINA: I think it's sweet.
LILY: Little princess? He probably calls every girl that.
NINA: Only Beth.
LILY: Well, I'm sure she lost the title after her game of chicken. Nina's smile fades.
NINA: I don't think so.
LILY: Sure, just gotta let him eat the Nina blushes, embarrassed, and Lily cracks up. A WAITER drops a plate in front of her.
WAITER: ( TO LILY )
LILY: Danke schoen.
WAITER: Let me know if it's not juicy Oh, I will. He smiles, keeping his eyes locked on Lily, as he rudely plops down Nina's plate.
LILY: Oh, I will. He smiles, keeping his eyes locked on Lily, as he rudely plops down Nina's plate.
WAITER: Lily watches him go, then notices Nina looking annoyed.
LILY: Guess I'm invisible. Lily studies her and digs into her purse. Pulls out a SEXY
NINA: Guess I'm invisible. Lily studies her and digs into her purse. Pulls out a SEXY
LILY: Here, wanna spruce up? Nina gives her a puzzled look.
NINA: I wouldn't know.
LILY: Yeah, right.
NINA: I don't want to talk about it.
LILY: Relax, you're so tense. Lily pulls out a cigarette case and clicks it open. Inside, CIGARETTES and a couple PILLS.
NINA: What is it?
LILY: You're kidding? You never rolled? Nina blinks.
NINA: ( CURIOUS )
LILY: Couple hours. Tops. Nina looks at the pill, thinks about it for a second.
NINA: That's okay.
LILY: Nina nods. Lily puts the pill back, and SNAPS the case 62 INT. GRUNGY BATHROOM - NIGHT 62 Wearing the SKIMPY SHIRT Lily offered her, Nina rinses her mouth out with water from the sink, then checks herself out in the mirror. It's broken and covered with graffiti and stickers. One particularly bright one says, "Seize the Day-glo." Nina's cell phone RINGS. She checks the ID"MOM"and silences it. Nina puts her SWEATSHIRT back on over the shirt, and exits.
LILY: Heeey, thought we could use some I'm gonna go.
NINA: I'm gonna go.
LILY: This is Tom and this is Jerry. The guys laugh.
ANDREW: Actually it's Andrew.
TOM: You can't leave, I bought you a Lily holds out the doctored beverage. Nina eyes it, tempted to go down the rabbit hole.
NINA: You can't leave, I bought you a Lily holds out the doctored beverage. Nina eyes it, tempted to go down the rabbit hole.

NINA: I really shouldn't, we're on the stage tomorrow.
LILY: What, you gonna go home to mommy? Live a little. Nina grins sheepishly and takes the drink. Lily smiles.
NINA: Just a couple of hours?
LILY: Nina takes a tiny sip.

NINA: Oh, I'm a dancer.
ANDREW: No, I mean your name.

LILY: ( FLIRTY )
TOM: You've got some mouth, you know Isn't that compliment a little Lily sips her drink, staring at Tom flirtatiously.
LILY: Isn't that compliment a little Lily sips her drink, staring at Tom flirtatiously.
NINA: You guys should come sometime. I can comp you tickets. Tom laughs, amused by Nina's earnestness.
TOM: Yeah.that'd be neat.
LILY: I think we all need another round. Bottom's up. She looks at Nina and sucks down her drink, challenging her to follow suit. Nina takes a breath of courage and empties her glass. She waits for something to kick in.
ANDREW: So.what are you guys working on these days? Her cell phone RINGS, interrupting him. She quickly turns it off and gives him an embarrassed smile.
NINA: Sorry. Swan Lake.
ANDREW: You know it?
NINA: You know it?
ANDREW: Oh, no, not really. Heard of it though. What's it about?
NINA: It's about a girl who's been turned into a swan. She needs love to break the spell.
ANDREW: Yeah, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself.
NINA: Yeah, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself.
ANDREW: So a happy ending, then?
NINA: It's beautiful, actually.
ANDREW: Like you. She starts to feel the initial tingles of the drug.
NINA: I said you're beautiful.
ANDREW: I said you're beautiful.
NINA: My hands are all sweaty. Andrew touches them. She grabs onto his hands. She looks at his face. His eyes twinkle at her. Lily slides in next to her. Nina sees her and melts into her body. Lily hugs her back.
LILY: Uh oh! Looks like someone's rolling. Let's get you dancing.

NINA: There were two. Tom and Jerry.
ERICA: Be quiet, Nina.
NINA: ( GIGGLING )
ERICA: Shut your mouth! Erica violently jams her fingers over Nina's lips, trying to silence her. Nina runs into her room and SLAMS the door.
NINA: Don't come in here! Erica tries to open the door, but it gets stuck. She peers her eye through the crack.
ERICA: What's this?
NINA: It's called privacy! I'm not fucking twelve years old anymore! Erica struggles a little with the door, but can't get it to You're not my Nina right now!
ERICA: You're not my Nina right now!

NINA: Why didn't you wake me up? Erica just stares at her, devastated.
NINA: ( TO HERSELF )
LEROY: Keep going. Let's finish the Act. The piano music resumes, and the dancers pick up where they left off.
NINA: Thomas, I'm sor- He ignores her, and walks off stage. Lily tentatively approaches with the PRACTICE TUTU.
LILY: Nina snatches it, avoiding eye contact. She puts it on.
NINA: ( LOADED )

NINA: You put something in my drink.
LILY: ( OBVIOUSLY )
NINA: And took off this morning.

LILY: Uh, no. Unless your name's Tom and you have a dick.
NINA: But we. Nina stops herself.
LILY: We what, Nina? Lily can read something on her face.
NINA: You're lying.
LILY: ( TICKLED )
NINA: Was I good?
LILY: Was I good?
NINA: ( BARKS )
LEROY: The Black Swan has stolen your love. There's only one way to end the pain. Nina climbs the stairs of the set and arrives at the "cliff," stopping at the precipice.
LEROY: At last, I saw the Black Swan.
COSTUMER: Sit still, I'm almost done. Nina startles. The reflection has returned to normal, its hand back at its side. Costumer checks one more thing, makes one more note.
NINA: ( TO COSTUMER )
LILY: He made me your alternate. ( can't help it ) Just in case. Nina pushes past her.
NINA: He stops and faces her.
LEROY: ( to stage manager,
STAGEHANDS ): Go ahead. I'll catch up. They continue walking.
NINA: Lily. You made her my alternate.
LEROY: There's always an alternate, you know that. Lily's the best choice.
NINA: She wants my role.
LEROY: Every dancer in the world wants your role.
NINA: No, she's different. She's after me. She's trying to replace me.
LEROY: ( CONDESCENDING )
NINA: Please believe me. He studies her for a moment, not sure what to make of this.
LEROY: Listen, I know it's been a struggle. But you had a breakthrough this morning. Nina starts to speak, he holds up his hand to silence her.
NINA: No more. Go home and rest. Shut down, she watches him walk away.
LEROY: No more. Go home and rest. Shut down, she watches him walk away.
NINA: What happened?
PIANO PLAYER: I gotta life, deary. He closes the music book and stands.
THE: 86A INT. STAGE - NIGHT 86A
NINA: Hey! Hey! I'm still in here. No one answers. She looks at the cavernous auditorium. All those empty seats, faced towards her. Very overwhelming. She hears a noise in the wings.
BETH: What are you doing here? Stunned, Nina's unable to answer. Beth follows her gaze to the random items on her table.
NINA: I'm so sorry. Beth begins touching the objects, vaguely remembering.
BETH: You stole all these things?
NINA: I just wanted to be like you. Beth shoots Nina a dark look and turns away.
BETH: I'm not perfect. I'm nothing.
NINA: It's not true.
BETH: Fucking nothing! Beth grabs the emory board and stabs herself in the face.
NINA: Nina spins Beth around. She is now a bloody version of THE DOUBLE! She continues stabbing herself. Nina grabs the Double's hand and struggles to restrain her.
DOUBLE: Stop it! Stop! The emory board stabs into Nina's arm. Nina rushes from the room.
NOTHING!: Stop it! Stop! The emory board stabs into Nina's arm. Nina rushes from the room.
NINA: Stop it! Stop! The emory board stabs into Nina's arm. Nina rushes from the room.
NINA: She goes out to investigate.
ERICA: What are you doing? Nina pushes past her, in a frenzy.
NINA: GO AWAY! She digs into the open bump on her shoulder with her Open the door!!! Erica violently pushes and pulls, jostling the piece of wood. Nina concentrates, takes hold of the growth and yanks. Blood vessels in her eyes explode, making the white turn red. Nina looks at the object held in her fingers: a sharp, TINY BLACK SPINE. Like that of a sea urchin. Damp, feathery wisps hang off of it. The door flings open. Erica rushes in and finds Nina half-naked, her skin inflamed.

The door flings open. Erica rushes in and finds Nina half-naked, her skin inflamed.
NINA: Get OUT! She manages to get her all the way out the door. But ROTHBART'S HAND grabs the door frame. Nina SLAMS the door, SMASHING the hand. Erica SCREAMS in pain. Nina slams the door again, and again. The hand now human. She finally gets the door all the way shut. She steps away from it, nervous. She looks down, sees one of her knees SNAP backwards, like that of a bird. Then the other knee SNAPS back. Nina stumbles and falls. And SLAMS her head into the radiator.
ERICA: Sshh, shhh, it's okay. I'm here. Nina looks around, disoriented. Sees her hands jammed inside thick socks, held on by rubber bands. Groggy, she tries to pull them off.
NINA: Where's the clock?
ERICA: Don't worry. Nina looks at the dark window.
NINA: It's dark. What night is it? Nina reads Erica's face. Reality clicks in.
ERICA: Don't worry. I called the theater and told them you weren't feeling Nina freaks, struggles more violently.
NINA: No, I want to.
ERICA: Lie down!
NINA: Get off me! Nina squirms free of Erica's grasp and gets out of bed. She gets to the door.
ERICA: We're staying in here until you feel better. Nina grips the metal post and pulls and pulls, shaking the Where is it? Erica calmly sits down in her CHAIR, waiting for the storm to This role is destroying you. Nina rifles through her dresser drawers. She notices her mother sitting calmly.
NINA: Where is it? Erica calmly sits down in her CHAIR, waiting for the storm to This role is destroying you. Nina rifles through her dresser drawers. She notices her mother sitting calmly.
ERICA: This role is destroying you. Nina rifles through her dresser drawers. She notices her mother sitting calmly.
NINA: Nina grabs her by the wrist.
ERICA: Nina grabs her by the wrist.
NINA: You're crazy!
ERICA: What happened to my sweet girl? Nina yanks Erica off the chair onto the floor.
NINA: She's gone.
ERICA: Please, you're not well. Under the cushion Nina grabs the hidden brass DOORKNOB. Erica lunges for her daughter's legs.
NINA: Let go!
ERICA: You can't handle it!
NINA: I can't?! I'm the fucking swan queen! You never even got out of the corps.
ERICA: You fucking ungrateful- Nina jams the knob onto the post, opens the door.
LILY: What are you doing here? The other girls follow her gaze towards Nina, and their smiles turn to confusion.
LILY: You're supposed to be sick.
LEROY: Lily, give us a minute. Leroy pulls Nina towards her room. Lily glares at Nina as she 97 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 97 Leroy closes the door behind them. He looks at Nina, wheels Are you okay?
LEROY: Are you okay?
NINA: I'm fine. Nina goes to her wardrobe, finds her two costumes hanging. One for the White Swan, one for the Black Swan.
LEROY: She doesn't heed him, pulls out the White Swan leotard and sets it on her chair.
NINA: I already asked Lily-
LEROY: I already asked Lily-
NINA: Fuck. Have you announced it? He hasn't.
LEROY: The only person standing in your way is you. It's time to let her go. Lose yourself. She nods. He takes one last look at her and leaves. She breathes a sigh of relief. Curious, she cracks open the door and peeks outside:
STAGE MANAGER: ( TO NINA )
STAGE MANAGER: What are you doing? You're on! He gently nudges her, and she has to run back on.
DAVID: What the fuck? She's too freaked to respond. They resume dancing, Nina barely keeping it together. Behind them, Rothbart appears and commands his flock to exit. The Little Swans start swirling off stage. Leaving Nina and David alone. David tries to pull her in one direction, but the dark hand of Rothbart summons her, transforming her back into a swan. She pulls away from David, frantically flapping, until she disappears into the wings.
ROTHBART: You alright? She looks up, sees his creepy MASK, and backs away. Rothbart has to go back on stage to finish the Act. Other CORPS MEMBERS surround her, chirping "You okay?, "What happened?" etc. Dazed, Nina doesn't answer. The music ends and there's a weak smattering of applause.
STAGE MANAGER: That's intermission! Act 3 in The other dancers scurry to get ready, abandoning her. Nina sees Leroy on stage chewing David out, behind the closed David spots Nina, glares at her, and sulks away. Leroy runs his fingers through his hair, his back to Nina. Nina cautiously approaches.
NINA: It wasn't my fault. He dropped me. He can't even look at her.
LEROY: ( RAGING )
LILY: Rough start, huh? Pretty Get out of here.
NINA: Get out of here.
LILY: Lily coyly smiles, and continues applying makeup.
NINA: Stop. Just stop.
LILY: How about.I dance the Black Swan for you? Nina looks into the mirror. Instead of Lily's reflection there's the Double.
NINA: Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
DOUBLE: ( IN MIRROR )
NINA: Leave me alone!!! She charges. And smashes her into the WALL LENGTH MIRROR, shattering it. Shards fall everywhere. The Double flips Nina over and wails on her. Punch after Nina does her best to block the onslaught. They scuffle, knocking things over, bumping into walls. The Double gets her hands around Nina's neck. Gasping for air, Nina tries to pull the hands free, but she's too strong.
EXIT: 111B BACKSTAGE 111B
DAVID: She walks away from him. Alone, she looks at her arms, sees black points trying to push through again. Some fully emerge as shiny BLACK FEATHERS. She just watches them, not panicking, but accepting the transformation taking place. Even beckoning it. Her second entrance cue is played.
STAGE MANAGER: That's you! She leaps back on
LEROY: Get back out there! Get back- She stops his mouth with a kiss. The kind of kiss that you can't stop. Not desperate, but adamant. Finally she disengages, staring at him in the eyes, but before he can say anything. She turns and rushes back on stage. He's stunned. Like he's been run over by a truck.
STAGE MANAGER: Great job. You got fifteen til the last act. She nods and arrives at her room. She opens the door, makes sure no ones looking, and enters 114 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 114 She closes the door behind her, locks it. Turns and sees the broken glass all over the floor. She eyes the closed wardrobe. A pool of blood drips out from under the door. She picks up a towel and lays it over the blood. She starts to undress.
NINA: One second. She goes to the door, opens it just a crack. She peeks through and finds. LILY looking back at her.
LILY: Hey.you were amazing. Nina's petrified.
LEROY: Listen to them! They love you! Get up, get up!
NINA: I felt it.
LEROY: Oh my god.
NINA: Someone, get help.
LEROY: Someone, get help.
NINA: Leroy looks back at her. She smiles.
