SECOND REPORTER: Does she remember anything about the fire at Universe House?

It's right here on our grounds, and Dr. Berrisford is familiar with both the neuromuscular problems a patient like this will encounter as well as the inevitable mental readjustment that will be required. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Good. Very good. Come on, just a few more steps.

CYNTHIA: What. what kind of doctor did you say you were?
BERRISFORD: Obviously, I'm not a surgeon. I'm a psychiatrist.
CYNTHIA: ( puzzled ) Why do I need a psychiatrist?
BERRISFORD: Cynthia, you've been out of touch with reality for over ten years. Your recovery goes beyond your muscle tone. You have to ease into life. into interacting with other people again. Into a world that's changed so much that sometimes I get confused by it. Now, my assistant Dr. Goldman has a group therapy session every day. I'm putting you down for it, starting tomorrow.
CYNTHIA: ( unsure ) Group therapy? But

CYNTHIA: ( sotto ) Why is he talking like that? Is he one of your patients?
BERRISFORD: Lieutenant Wasserman is a police officer. And the word "patience" isn't part of his vocabulary.
WASSERMAN: Miss Weston. What's the last thing you remember before.
CYNTHIA: Before the accident? Nothing.
WASSERMAN: Then how do you know it was an I remember. a beautiful sunset. Harris, smiling at me.

WASSERMAN: Miss Weston. This "Unity House". was it a cult?
CYNTHIA: I'm sorry. I don't understand the A "cult," Cynthia. A syndrome of society you have been fortunate enough to miss. They're popular with impressionable people, the penny press. .and lazy policemen who like to blame them for crimes they can't

We're going to got you out of your neurosises. We're going to got you out of that hideous hospital robe and into a flimsy revealing negligeeone with the little holes here? I can see us now on a desert island. You, me, a portable waterbed
ALAN: Ralph, sit down and cut out the shit, okay?

CYNTHIA: What's a borderline personality?

RALPH: ( standing, SCREAMING like You forgot VIOLENT MOOD SWINGS!
CONNIE: He also forgot suicidal tendencies. But, as one whose previous reincarnations stretch back to Ancient Atlantis, well, suicide is meaningless anyway.
ED: And don't forgot binge eating. Gourmet binge eating.
MIRIAM: ( sweetly, to Cynthia ) I told you he was making this up.
ALAN: If everyone is finished
LANA: ( breaking in ) They're not finished, Dr. Goldman, they won't be finished until they have her feeling as miserable and pathetic and confused as they are.
CYNTHIA: I am confused
LANA: ( to the group ) I hope you're all happy
CYNTHIA: Dr. Goldman, I. I don't really know what I'm doing here. I mean. I don't think I meet your description of a Borderline Give yourself some time, Cynthia. We'll help you work on it.

CYNTHIA: He said he thought that this would help me. fit into the 80's.
MIRIAM: Honey, you want to fit into the 80's, you're already two divorces, one condo and a yeast infection behind. Why don't you just catch up with the 70's and move to If I can offer a more practical suggestion. Why don't you talk, About something close to you.
ALAN: If I can offer a more practical suggestion. Why don't you talk, About something close to you.
CYNTHIA: About something close to you.
ALAN: About something close to you.
MIRIAM: Stop beating around the fucking bush, Goldman! Just come out and ask her!
LANA: ( to Miriam ) Do you have to be so crude?
MIRIAM: Come on, Cynthia. Dish out the dirt. Tell us all about Unity The last gasp of the Age of Aquarius. Building a better world through. what? Chemistry? Good vibrations? Tie-dying your undies?
CYNTHIA: I'm sorry to disappoint you. I don't have those kinds of stories.

RALPH: ( acting out )
GILDA: 27 NEW ANGLE 27
CYNTHIA: ( touched )
ALAN: Gilda hasn't said three words in three weeks. And now, Cynthia comes in with this love, peace and Woodstock routine and. presto. Am I missing something, or what?
BERRISFORD: She's espousing a total belief system. A kind of holistic healing matrix not unlike the dynamic energy shift model. Isn't that interesting? They're adopting it, embracing it.
ALAN: Too bad we can't follow through on Why not?
BERRISFORD: Why not?
ALAN: Dr. Berrisford, the people in this group. some of them are deeply disturbed. Cynthia doesn't belong with them an experiment for one session, fine, but in the long run
BERRISFORD: Alan. We've opened primary channels of communication. You've opened them, Alan. Let's not rush to throw away our progress. Neuroses are hardly contagious. A few weeks in the group won't hurt Cynthia. With luck, she'll overcome her memory trauma. That would mean progress. not to Mention getting Lieutenant Wasserman off my back. In the
ALAN: A united front. Sure.
HETTIE: Drop down to first gear, honey. It's Miller time.

ALAN: ( carefully ) Your parents died when you were a child. We haven't been able to locate any relatives.
CYNTHIA: I guess I'd just look up some of the old hands from Unity House. crash with them for a while. .do people still say "crash"?
ALAN: ( gently ) There aren't any old hands left. The fire that injured you.? It took everyone also with it. They're all gone.
CYNTHIA: I knew there were deaths. but. I'm afraid so. Look, Cynthia. I'm not saying this to upset you, but the sooner you realize that that whole phase of your life is over, and move on, the better off you're going to be. Why don't you bring this into the open. talk about it in group? Oh, here's our

ALAN: Could somebody hit one? Thanks.
CYNTHIA: ( to him ) "Talk about it in group." Is that the answer to everything around
ALAN: Nobody ever said it would be easy. And it works for a lot of people.
CYNTHIA: ( gently ) It's not working for Ralph. or his chest. ( pleading tone ) Can't you at least transfer me. get me in a group of people with problems a little more like mine
ALAN: Cynthia, we don't have a lot of patients who've been in a coma for over a decade!

ALAN: ( patiently ) She has no history of drug abuse
BERRISFORD: There's other kinds of addictions. we see it in these fringe religious groups. these instant creeds with pseudo-Messianic delusions. You've heard how she talks about Unity House? Perhaps that's her drug. Perhaps she's going through awithdrawal of sorts. Her memory lapses about Unity House are equally symptomatic. There's some violent turmoil under that pretty little facade.

CYNTHIA: The candles are out. Victor isn't in the room. Cynthia, drenched with sweat, slowly catches her breath. She looks around, confused.
CYNTHIA: She checks in the kitchen. Nothing. She looks back in the bedroom. The apartment is empty. She's just calming whenMEEOW! The CAT LEAPS out of nowhere, startling her, and then running out of sight. She swallows. Very nervous now, she sits on the couch and starts pulling on her jeans and shoes. The CAMERA MOVES AROUND her, revealing the entire apartment. We see EVERY ANGLE. It is completely quiet and still. The CAMERA SETTLES at one ANGLE on Cynthia. A shadow behind her MOVES.
VICTOR: Where are you going?

ALAN: Okay. First off, we're all going to feel a little silly and maybe look a little silly.
RALPH: ( a la Groucho ) Especially in that shirt you're wearing, Goldman.
ALAN: ( amused, but pushing on ) but this technique works, and we're going to release some of our hidden aggression. Who's going to go first? Lana?
LANA: ( pause ) How many helpless goose had to die to fill those stupid pillows?
ALAN: ( as everyone groans ) None, Lana. They're polyester. Ed? Want to start?
ED: Nah. Let's talk about the geese again. Nice fat ones, with all the All right, how about if we all start together and eliminate the wimp factor. Come on.

MIRIAM: ( pounding ) I'm pretending this is my first husband. No, maybe my third. ( grinning ) Can I have a baseball bat?
ALAN: Please, people, let's work at being I know you had a rough night. But you have to participate.
HARRIS: You failed me, Cynthia. You failed all of us. We were supposed to be together. in this world. and in the next.
CYNTHIA: It is a blood-curdling and heart-stopping a scream as ever There is a FLASH of light.
NOOOOOOOOO!: It is a blood-curdling and heart-stopping a scream as ever There is a FLASH of light.
CYNTHIA: ( softly, tense ) .They. they sang songs as they stacked up the white containers. they were. happy.

They were. happy. smiling. laughing. crying from happiness as he drenched them in the gasoline.
WASSERMAN: ( under his breath ) Somehow, I. I knew it was wrong. I ran. When he threw the match, I was at the other end of the hallway. There was a flash. and a. like a wind, or the hand of Godpicked me up, threw me. The ceiling fell in. When I opened my eyes. ( she looks up ) I was here.

ALAN: ( to Wasserman ) If that's what happened, why didn't you find any evidence of arson?
WASSERMAN: The plastic jerry cans would've burned up before anything else. We knew there'd been an explosion. We just didn't know how or why.
BERRISFORD: Well. You must be pleased. Closing a case after. what is it, twelve years?
WASSERMAN: Who says it's closed? What's that supposed to mean?
ALAN: What's that supposed to mean?
WASSERMAN: When the fairy princess here woke up, she said she didn't remember anything about 32 deaths. Now she remembers they committed suicide.
HETTIE: That man's a candidate for shock therapy. with a car battery right to the cojones.
CYNTHIA: No. he's right. I am guilty.
BERRISFORD: Well, Alan. Still think she doesn't belong in the group?
MIRIAM: Nothing like a hot shower, huh?
LANA: Cynthia? Cynthia? Are you okay?
CYNTHIA: Are you all right? After that session today, I
LANA: Are you all right? After that session today, I
CYNTHIA: I'm fine.
LANA: I think. you're a decent person. not a. mean spirited witch like some people.
CYNTHIA: ( distant tone ) All my friends are dead.
MIRIAM: Lana, wait a minute, she didn't mean itshit.
CYNTHIA: I can't even help myself.
DISTANT VOICES: ( echo affect ) Be cleansed!
VOICE: Cleanse the heart of your mind.
HARRIS: Cynthia. You are part of the
CYNTHIA: He killed herhe killed her because I broke my word. He said he'd take someone else, and he did. She wanted my help. my friendship. That's why. he took her.
HETTIE: Move it, people, this ain't a sideshow. Get back to your
BERRISFORD: ( thinking aloud ) She's a textbook specimen from a collective environment, an immersion philosophy, run by an extremely manipulative figurehead with Messianic delusions. Unity House at its apex must have been a classic matrix of belief impression overlaid on collectivity That would indicate she's symptomatic of a hypothetical Borderline Personality syndrome among cult followers, all externalizing their anxiety! What do you think?
ALAN: ( exploding ) I think she's fucking freaked out about Lana!
BERRISFORD: ( a shrug )
ED: ( aside to Ralph ) Did you see the swimming pool this morning? The cops are all over it. Fingerprints, photographs.
RALPH: Next they'll send in the fucking coast guard. Lot of good it'll do
HETTIE: Ralph, we're gonna start billing you for these outbursts.
CONNIE: Drowning isn't so bad. I remember when I died in Atlantis. It was like failing asleep. You know what's bad? Burning. When I was in the great Fire of London, well, let me tell you
MIRIAM: Connie, I don't know about your previous lives, but in this one, you're a shithead.
MIRIAM: Honey, you can't blame yourself. Lana was an unhappy girl. Sometimes unhappy girls do foolish She didn't kill herself.
CYNTHIA: She didn't kill herself.
MIRIAM: ( CONTINUED )
CYNTHIA: From Unity House. He comes to me, Miriam. He talks to me. He reminds me that I was supposed to go with them that night
MIRIAM: Go with them
CYNTHIA: Through the fire. To the next world. They waited while I was in a coma. He told me that if I didn't join him, he would take someone also. and he did it, Miriam, he did it!
MIRIAM: I believe that you believe it. And I also believe that shooting you up every time you get the heebie- jeebies ain't gonna do shit for your real problems. We gotta get you out of hereget you to some nice place at the beach or the mountains where you can fight your demons in your own way. Right?
CYNTHIA: But I don't know anyone. I don't have any money.
MIRIAM: You know me.
CYNTHIA: ( skeptical ) And you have money, right?
MIRIAM: Look. Despite popular opinion to the contrary, I have not always been the career borderline psychotic neurotic that I am today. Up until a coupla years ago I was a writer, a reporter, a damn good one too. Hell, I really kicked some ass with that Selectric.
CYNTHIA: ( shaking her head, I was in a coma.
MIRIAM: Oh, right. Well, when they took me off to the funny farm, Saulhe's the editorhe said I was always welcome back. Maybe this is the time. See, if I can go to him, tell him your story, I could get a big advance. I'd share it with you, and we'd be set! I mean, girl, your story has everything. death, hospitalization, weird rituals, maybe a little romance I've seen all those longing glances between you and Goldman-
CYNTHIA: and now with poor Lana we got a little mystery. Hell, you're not an article, you're a goddamned mini- I. I don't know.
MIRIAM: and now with poor Lana we got a little mystery. Hell, you're not an article, you're a goddamned mini- I. I don't know.
CYNTHIA: I. I don't know.
MIRIAM: Cynthia, let me be honest. This is a great story, and it means a second chance for me, so, okay, there's some self interest here. But I really think you need to tell people about Unity House. about the way decent ideas and dreams got twisted into something sick and poisonous. You owe it to the world. You owe it to yourself. It's your life, and you have to ask yourself how you want to live it. if you want to live it.
CYNTHIA: Let's do it.
MIRIAM: I think I know a way to make a phone call. We'll have you out of here tonight.
CYNTHIA: Of course it is.
MIRIAM: Uh oh. Mum's the word.
ALAN: ( nodding ) Ladies. Good to see you socializing, Cynthia.
CYNTHIA: ( to Miriam ) See you later. And. thanks.
MIRIAM: Thank you.
ALAN: How are you feeling?
CYNTHIA: He heads off in the opposite direction. Cynthia watches him. She turns back towards Miriam. Miriam is alone in the elevator except for one other person. Miriam smiles and waves. Cynthia smiles and waves. From behind Miriam, Harris, all burned and puffy, smiles and The elevator doors close.

ANOTHER VOICE: She's trying to get away!

FEMALE VOICE: She's over here.
HARRIS: No pain, Cynthia. There's no pain. Come with us. Share with us. Take my hand.
ORDERLY'S VOICE: Take my hand.
ORDERLY: Cynthia, take my hand.
ALAN: The nurse crosses herself. Cynthia is escorted away amid the 99 EXT. SKY - DAY 99 The CAMERA IS MOVING FORWARD, TOWARDS the window. It seemingly goes OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW. The FRAME is filled with bright blue sky. Silence, except for a slight BREEZE. Someone is falling through the sky. It is MIRIAM. We see her CLOSER, flowing down, the wind rushing up round her. She is happy.
MIRIAM: Cynthia, it's really quite

FIRST REPORTER: Dr. Berrisford, what would you call two suicides on your promises so close together?
BERRISFORD: I'd call it a tragic coincidence. Unfortunately, Borderline Personality Disorder is indicative of a pre-existing disposition towards suicidal tendencies.
SECOND REPORTER: What about the commune girl? Has she confirmed that the fire was some sort of mass suicide?
BERRISFORD: As that is a police matter, I am not at liberty to comment on it.
FIRST REPORTER: Speaking of the police, doctor, isn't it true that they suspect that the recent deaths may not have been suicides at all?
BERRISFORD: That's completely absurd. Where do you get this nonsense?
FIRST REPORTER: ( a smug smile ) From Lieutenant Wasserman. He confirmed to me that he's assigning some of his officers to the hospital grounds until further
REPORTERS: ( rapid fire ) Doctor Berrisford, are you cooperating with the police? Dr. Berrisford, do your patients have a history of violence?
BERRISFORD: Ah. I have work to do. No further questions.
HARRIS: You're in pain, Cynthia.
ALAN: I didn't want you to be alone.
HETTIE: What are you doing here?
ED: You know me at feeding time. Why didn't you tell me before that you were a Prince of Ancient It slipped my mind . your

CYNTHIA: It's Harrishe's going to do something to Connieto Ed!
ALAN: Good! Get madget angrybut not at meat these fantasies!
CONNIE: ( wistful ) Nectar from the grapes of Atlantis!
ED: No fooling you.
ED: I'm so happy.
ALAN: Miriam and Lana were both deeply disturbed women. Miriam tried to kill herself before. Lana was obsessed with the morbid. You heard her in the sessions. You can't twist what they did into something other than what it was.
NURSE: It's just overloaded circuits. Everyone, please go back into your
EDGAR: The turbine room upstairs? All We'll set it straight in a minute. Somethin's caught in the turbine.

ALAN: Yes. We're not sure what happened. There was evidence that they were drinking. They fell into. the main turbine.
RALPH: Fuck. Look, Ed drank before. Lots of times. Didn't know that, did you? But he didn't usually decide to jump into a mix master, Ralph, as for your own safety, you are being given the most amount of protection possible.
ALAN: Ralph, as for your own safety, you are being given the most amount of protection possible.
GILDA: The police are powerless. Ask Cynthia. She knows. Harris wants us all.
RALPH: Jesus Fucking Christ! I'm getting the hell out of here.
RALPH: Now what?
COP: Lieutenant Wasserman assigned me to you. Where you go
RALPH: I get the picture. Try not to shoot me or your fat ass, okay?
ALAN: Isn't this a coincidence?

HETTIE: Dr. Goldman, have you seen Ralph?
ALAN: I was going to ask you the same
HETTIE: He didn't take his four o'clock. If he misses this one, I'm gonna.
ALAN: Shit! It's his tranquilizer! If he doesn't take this, he'll completely flip out!
CYNTHIA: 136 ANGLE - ON THE FLOOR 136
RALPH'S POLICEMAN: Are you sure you know where you're
ALAN: Was he behaving strangely?
CYNTHIA: No more strangely than everybody also in this place.
CYNTHIA'S POLICEMAN: ( with walkie-talkie ) I can't get him. He must be shut
CYNTHIA: A BLOODY HAND reaches out of the elevator covering her mouth and pulls her inside.
ALAN: 141 INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT 141
CYNTHIA: Ralph, we have to go and get your
RALPH: He smiles.
CYNTHIA: Ralph, I'm not going out. We have to go back upstairs.
RALPH: I have to talk to you.
CYNTHIA: Ralph, you're not being yourself. Can't you tell?
RALPH: No! This is the real me!
CYNTHIA: Ralph, please! How do we get out?
RALPH: It's been said by better men than me in better ways in better times there is no way out!
CYNTHIA: ( CONTINUED )
RALPH: There are only a few chances for real glory, and most people fuck it up. Most people can't even find the noses on their fucking faces. You want an example? How about EVERY FUCKING DOCTOR in this entire hospital? Do you think I'm just going to let myself slowly dissolve into nothingness here?! I'm talking about a glorious glory. And everybody's trying to drag me Ralph, please, they said you have to take some pills.
CYNTHIA: Ralph, please, they said you have to take some pills.
RALPH: Pills have got nothing to do with it! You know what I'm talking
CYNTHIA: No, I don't. I don't.
RALPH: You do! Real glory, hallelujah! The great big gig in the sky. Don't play dumb, Cynthia.

WASSERMAN: You're running out of patients, What did she say happened?
ALAN: What did she say happened?
WASSERMAN: She's having a little trouble with realityas usual.
CYNTHIA: ( to Alan ) Goodbye, Alan. Thanks for trying. But it's time for me to go now.
ALAN: I have to go with her. Where is she being taken?
BERRISFORD: ( stunned ) Isolation? Are you out of your mind? That girl needs human contactconnectionisolation is the worst thing you can do
ALAN: ( stunned ) Isolation? Are you out of your mind? That girl needs human contactconnectionisolation is the worst thing you can do
BERRISFORD: Dr. Goldman, I know you're fond of the girl, but you're out of line.
ALAN: Shit. You want her on the edge, don't you. You want to play your theory out to the end
BERRISFORD: ( interested ) Theory? Anything I should know?
WASSERMAN: ( interested ) Theory? Anything I should know?
BERRISFORD: It's an extraordinarily complex situation, severe identity crisis compounded with the multiple shock of these deaths. She's reverting to this total belief system from the commune through an intermittent psychosis that puts ideology above her life itself
ALAN: Fuck ideology! Fuck you, Berrisford! You can't use a human being as a guinea pig You have to stop this. Call it offI'llI'll sign her into police custody if I can stay on as her physician

SECURITY GUARD: We're gonna miss you around here, Dr. Goldman.
HARRIS' VOICE: You were always the favorite. We love you. Come with us.
CYNTHIA: Why are you doing it to everybody else? Why don't you kill me?
CONNIE: You have to do it yourself, honey. When you didn't. he took us instead. But we're not mad. It's wonderful here.
LANA: You mustn't be afraid, Cynthia.
MIRIAM: if I can do it, you can do it, Why don't you kill me?

CYNTHIA: But Harris comes to me. He speaks to me
ALAN: A drug induced psychotic state is very suggestible. All we've hearing for days is "Harris, Harris,". so that's what we all saw. That's what I saw when I took Ralph's pill! It's all part of Berrisford's planhe has this fucked-up theory about how you still think you're part of the Unity House, and the only way he can prove it is if you want to kill
BERRISFORD: Dr. Goldman.
CYNTHIA: No. no. no.

ALAN: Your life has a purpose. to bring joy and happiness! You're part of my life now. That's an unfinished story, too.
CYNTHIA: Let me up. Stop it.
BERRISFORD: I'm afraid it's too late for that.
GUARD: Dr. Berrisford?
DOCTOR'S VOICE: I need a detox prep! Stat!
CYNTHIA: It was him.
ALAN: It's okay. It's over. It was Berrisford. He killed them.
CYNTHIA: Then all those other things. Faces. voices? They were. in my head?
ALAN: It was Berrisford. He shot you up with hallucinogens. What he didn't do, you imagined.
CYNTHIA: Go right if that's the interstate. Yeah, it is.
ALAN: Victorian. Looks like it was a nice house once.
CYNTHIA: Yes. I guess appearances can be
ALAN: ( CONTINUED )
CYNTHIA: It's over.
LAWYER: ( in mid-speech ) letters of support could have an influence on the court. You know, from your peers?
BERRISFORD: ( cutting him off ) I have no peers. ( turning ) Hello, Lieutenant. ( smiling ) Forgive me for not getting up.
WASSERMAN: Real funny, Doctor. Try this for laughs: As soon as you're ambulatory, you're going in front of a Grand Jury, and you're going to be charged with six counts of obstruction of justice and two counts of assault.
BERRISFORD: Well. I don't agree with your definition of justice, but I suppose I obstructed it. All in the name of science, of course
LAWYER: ( appalled ) Doctor Berrisford
BERRISFORD: ( hushing him ) but as to murder, well, Lieutenant, I beg to differ. I didn't kill anyone. Why would I? I'm only interested in knowledge. Cynthia is a unique girlthe product of an environment and a philosophy unrivaled in its purity. I wanted to understand the depth of her commitment, the link between psychosis and total immersion philosophies, the dark terra incognita of the human psyche
WASSERMAN: ( fed up ) Hey, go chow on a Latin dictionary, okay? You can bullshit all you want, but how do you account for six bodies?
BERRISFORD: Clearly some unknown variable was a Yeah? Well, if you didn't kill off the therapy group, who did?
WASSERMAN: Yeah? Well, if you didn't kill off the therapy group, who did?
BERRISFORD: Lieutenant, I'll put it in terms even a policeman can understand.
ALAN: What's the matter?
CYNTHIA: I was just thinking about Gilda. Somehow, she knew. She kept talking about "him," but I didn't know what she meant. She said the answer was inside me. Why would she say that?
ALAN: Let's go.
CYNTHIA: You go down. I'll be out in a minute. I just want to. bury some memories.
ALAN: You sure?
WOMAN 1: Cynthia! Are you staying for
VICTOR: Cynthia. It's good. Come in.
MIRIAM: Cynthia, I'm so glad you're here.
GILDA: Cynthia, it's so wonderful here, but we miss you terribly.
HARRIS: It's time, Cynthia. It's finally time, isn't it?
EVERYONE: ( fighting the vision ) You don't exist.
CYNTHIA: ( fighting the vision ) You don't exist.
HARRIS: I wouldn't say that. Go on. Take the knife.
GILDA: You know you do, Cynthia.
VICTOR: You'll see how beautiful it is.
SOMEONE ELSE: You will.
MIRIAM: Cynthia, we're only telling you this because we love you.
HARRIS: Beautiful lovechild. All will be in balance when you've joined us. All will be right when daughter is with father.
SOMEONE: You're special, Cynthia.
SOMEONE ELSE: Scared blood. daughter of the

HARRIS: Now you remember.
CYNTHIA: My own beautiful lovechild. Everyone has proven their love to me. Now you must.
HARRIS: My own beautiful lovechild. Everyone has proven their love to me. Now you must.
CYNTHIA: She jams the knife into Harris' throat and pulls it out.
HARRIS: ( saddened ) Oh, Cynthia.
CYNTHIA: I never needed you! Any of you!
ALAN: She drops the knife. The knife is all rusty and corroded. The floor is a charred mass. Cynthia turns around. Alan comes in the front door. The room is again its empty, skeletal self, blackened and silent. Cynthia is trembling. She walks out of the room.
CYNTHIA: Let's go.
CYNTHIA: It's going to be okay. I'm going to be okay.
BOY: ( far off ) Come on, where are you? I hope you're not in that house. You always got like this and make stupid threats that you don't mean!
GIRL: ( startled ) Who are you?
HARRIS: A friend. You're upset.
GIRL: Eternal bliss? What do you mean?
