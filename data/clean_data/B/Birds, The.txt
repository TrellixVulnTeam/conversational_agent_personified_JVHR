"THE BIRDS": Evan Hunter Based on the novel "Birds" Daphne Du Maurier
MELANIE: Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
MRS. MACGRUDER: Hello, Miss Daniels.
MELANIE: What do you suppose it is?
MED. SHOT: Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is BARKING, o.s.
MRS. MACGRUDER: ( shaking her head ) There must be a storm at sea. That can drive them inland, you know. They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end. There is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets in the bigger cages. As they walk:
MRS. MACGRUDER: I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels. You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
MELANIE: You said three o'clock.
MRS. MACGRUDER: I know. Oh, I know. I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to.
MELANIE: Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
MRS. MACGRUDER: Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
MELANIE: And he'll talk?
MRS. MACGRUDER: Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
MELANIE: MRS. MACGRUDER ( pause ) Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock. ( pause ) Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
MRS. MACGRUDER: ( pause ) Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock. ( pause ) Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
MELANIE: ( judiciously ) I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. ( she begins taking off her gloves )
MRS. MACGRUDER: ( producing pencil and pad ) Oh. Oh, well, all right. As Melanie starts writing:
MRS. MACGRUDER: I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
MELANIE: ( with a resigned sigh ) Well, all right, but. She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight. Melanie finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.
MITCH: I wonder if you could help me.
MELANIE: ( deliberately, and with a touch of hauteur ) I said I wonder if you could help CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea comes to her.

MELANIE: ( solicitously ) Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
MITCH: ( deadpan ) Lovebirds, sir?
MELANIE: Lovebirds, sir?
MITCH: Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
MELANIE: Well. yes, sir, there are.
MITCH: These are for my sister. her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and. well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too I understand completely, sir.
MELANIE: I understand completely, sir.
MITCH: As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
MELANIE: ( leading him around shop ) No, of course not.
MITCH: Do you have a pair that are just I think so, sir. Now then, let me see.
MELANIE: I think so, sir. Now then, let me see.
MITCH: ( at the finches ) Aren't these lovebirds?
MELANIE: No, sir, those are. redbirds.
MITCH: The sign says strawberry finches.
MELANIE: ( airily ) Yes, we call them that too. ( she moves away ) Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds. ( and stops before a cage of canaries )
MITCH: Those are canaries, Miss. Doesn't this make you feel awful?
MELANIE: ( baffled ) Doesn't what make me.?
MITCH: All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
MELANIE: Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
MITCH: I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
MELANIE: Oh, certainly. It's to protect the I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
MITCH: I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
MELANIE: Yes, that's a particularly dangerous Are they moulting now?
MITCH: Are they moulting now?
MELANIE: Some of them are.
MITCH: How can you tell?
MELANIE: Well. they get a sort of hangdog CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V. The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.
MITCH: Yes, I see. About those lovebirds, Miss.
MELANIE: Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
MITCH: All right. She smiles back.
MITCH: ( he waits ) All right, may I see one, please?
MELANIE: ( feebly ) Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie. One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.
MELANIE: Oh! Ohhhhh!
MRS. MACGRUDER: What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the birds is loose! She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches them suspiciously.
MITCH: Shhh! Shhhh! He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it.
MELANIE: There we are!
MRS. MACGRUDER: Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
MITCH: ( putting the canary in ) Back into your gilded cage, Melanie CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE What did you say?
MELANIE: What did you say?
MITCH: ( savoring this ) I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
MELANIE: But how. how do you know my name?
MITCH: ( secretly ) A little birdie told me. ( he smiles politely ) Good day, Miss Daniels. ( he bows to Mrs. MacGruder ) ( he starts out )
MELANIE: Hey, wait a minute! She goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her bafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then:
MELANIE: I don't know you.
MITCH: Ahhh, but I know you.
MELANIE: We met in court.
MITCH: We met in court.
MELANIE: We never met in court or anyplace That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
MITCH: That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
MELANIE: Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
MITCH: Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
MELANIE: I didn't break that window!
MITCH: No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind What are you? A policeman?
MELANIE: What are you? A policeman?
MITCH: I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
MELANIE: What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical.
MITCH: Ahhh, but I really do want those You knew I didn't work here. You Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
MELANIE: You knew I didn't work here. You Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
MITCH: Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
MELANIE: I think you're a louse.
MITCH: I am. Good day.
MELANIE: And I'm glad you didn't get your I'll find something else. See you in court some day. The door closes. The puppy begins BARKING.
MITCH: ( breezily, as he goes out ) I'll find something else. ( he gives a slight bow ) See you in court some day. The door closes. The puppy begins BARKING.
MELANIE: ( angrily ) That. that. who was that?
MRS. MACGRUDER: I have no idea.
MELANIE: Have you got a pencil?
MRS. MACGRUDER: What? Oh, yes, certainly. As Melanie begins writing:
MRS. MACGRUDER: They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back.
MELANIE: No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
MRS. MACGRUDER: ( bewildered by everything ) Yes, certainly. ( she puts phone on counter )
MELANIE: ( as she dials ) Do you have any lovebirds?
MRS. MACGRUDER: No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
MELANIE: How soon?
MRS. MACGRUDER: Well. well, how soon would you want them?

MELANIE: ( curtly ) He's not home.
MAN: He's not home.
MELANIE: That's all right. She presses button for the elevator.
MAN: He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him..
MELANIE: Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?

MELANIE: ( pause, stymied )
MITCH: ( blurting the only name she knows ) Annie. Annie Hayworth.
MELANIE: ( blurting the only name she knows ) Annie. Annie Hayworth.
MITCH: Well, well, small world. Annie How do you know Annie?

MELANIE: ( pulling away ) Oh, no you don't!
MITCH: It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on. He takes up a tiny Band-Aid and, tearing the gauze off, says:
MITCH: Bend your head down. This little Band-Aid won't show. He presses the tiny Band-Aid over the cut. Melanie takes a mirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at it. She covers her hair over it as Mitch says:
MITCH: So you came up to see Annie, huh?
MELANIE: I don't believe you. I think you came up to see me.
MITCH: I don't believe you. I think you came up to see me.
MELANIE: Why would I want to see you, of all I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and.
MITCH: ( shrugging ) I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and.
MELANIE: It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you.
MITCH: ( grinning ) You like me, huh?
MELANIE: I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and. I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
MITCH: What did it say?
MELANIE: None of your business. Am I still bleeding? She lowers her head.
MITCH: Can't see a thing.
MELANIE: I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to.

MELANIE: I was wondering.
ANNIE: That sign. Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
MELANIE: That sign. Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
ANNIE: Well, I'd really hope to rent it I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all Sure. You can have it. Where's your bag? In the car? Melanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then It's utilitarian, I'll say that for I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.

ANNIE: ( after a pause ) Sure. You can have it. ( smiles ) Where's your bag? In the car? Melanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then It's utilitarian, I'll say that for ( smiling ) I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.

MELANIE: ( smiling ) I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
ANNIE: Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up? There is a moment where both women look at each other. When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold she is again telling Annie to mind her own business.
MELANIE: ( pause ) May I use your phone? I'd like to call home. There is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's attitude, and then accepts it. She suddenly smiles warmly.
ANNIE: Why don't you come in then? I was just about to mix a martini. She is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both hear a SOUND overhead. They turn to look skyward.
ANNIE: ( shaking her head ) Don't they ever stop migrating? But Melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously serious expression.
DISSOLVE: LONG SHOT - THE APPROACH ROAD to the Brenner house. Melanie's car is driving along the shore. Behind her, the sky is stained with sunset. There are gulls on the bay, cawing into the FULL SHOT - THE CAR as it pulls into the Brenner yard.
MELANIE: ( calling ) FULL SHOT - MITCH, CATHY, LYDIA in the distance. Mitch and Cathy raise their arms.
CATHY: ( excitedly ) ( she breaks into a trot toward Melanie ) CLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she approaches. She is an eleven-year- old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head. She hesitates for just a moment.
CATHY: Miss Daniels?
MELANIE: And Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking her off her feet, hugging her fiercely.
CATHY: They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
MELANIE: Well, I suppose.
MITCH: ( coming up ) Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
MELANIE: Dinner's just about ready. We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
MITCH: Dinner's just about ready. We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
LYDIA: ( going toward house ) There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
MITCH: ( as they follow into house ) I don't know what good that'll do. ( aside to Melanie ) Chickens won't eat.
LYDIA: He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
MITCH: Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer Whose side are you on?
LYDIA: Whose side are you on?
MITCH: I'm simply quoting the law.
LYDIA: Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup. She has finished dialing now, is waiting while the phone

I?: ( pause ) Fred, that feed you sold me is no ( pause ) The chicken feed. The three bags I CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA holding the telephone.
LYDIA: Well, it's just no good. The chickens won't eat it. They're always hungry, Fred. I opened one of the sacks when I got home, and I poured it out for them, and they wouldn't touch it. Now you know chickens as well as I do, and when they won't eat, there's just something wrong with what they're being fed, that's all. No, they're not fussy chickens. Who? What's he got to do with it? Fred, I don't care how much feed you sold him. My chickens. He did? Dan Fawcett? This afternoon? Well, that only proves what I'm saying. The feed you sold us is. Oh. Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh- huh. Maybe I ought to go over to see him. You don't think there's something going around, do you? No, never. No, Fred, they don't seem sick at all. They just won't eat. Mmmm. Mmmmm. Well, I'll try to get over to Dan's farm. Maybe he'll. mmmmm. mmmmm. all right, Fred,
LYDIA: ( as she sits ) He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
CATHY: It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
LYDIA: ( slowly ) No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand. ( extremely worried ) You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
DISSOLVE: FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM The meal is over. The lovebirds in their hanging cage have been covered for the night. In the b.g. Mitch and Lydia are carrying the stacked dishes to the kitchen. In the f.g. Cathy and Melanie are by a small upright piano. Melanie is playing a Debussy Arabesque: She picks up a cigarette from the ashtray now and again to take a puff.
CATHY: I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
MELANIE: Your brother told me.
LYDIA: ( as she goes into kitchen ) Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
MELANIE: No, not exactly.
CATHY: Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly Well, Mom, he's the first to admit He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice.

LYDIA: ( coming from kitchen ) In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice.
CATHY: Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods. He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it? I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
MELANIE: ( to Mitch as he carries load of dishes out ) Why did he shoot her?
MITCH: He was watching a ball game on His wife changed the channel. He GOES INTO kitchen.
MELANIE: His wife changed the channel. He GOES INTO kitchen.
MITCH: His wife changed the channel. He GOES INTO kitchen.
CATHY: Is smoking fun?
MELANIE: Oh, I suppose so.
CATHY: Could I have a puff?
MELANIE: I don't think your mother would like Just a little one.
CATHY: ( delighted ) Why, it's just like air, isn't it? ( determined ) When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
MELANIE: I know.
CATHY: Are you coming to my party?
MELANIE: I don't think so. I have to get back to San Francisco.
CATHY: Don't you like us?
MELANIE: ( touching her hair ) Darling, of course I do!
CATHY: Don't you like Bodega Bay?
MELANIE: I don't know yet.
CATHY: Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
MELANIE: ( smiling ) I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
CATHY: If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party. Melanie laughs.
CATHY: You see, they've got this whole complicated thing figured out where I'm going over to Michele's for the afternoon, and Michele's mother is going to say she has a headache and would I mind very much if she took me home. Then, when we get back here, all of the kids'll jump out! Won't you come? Won't you please CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE shaking her head, glancing toward the kitchen.
MELANIE: I don't think so, Cathy.
LYDIA: She's a charming girl, isn't she, Yes, very.
MITCH: Yes, very.
LYDIA: And certainly pretty.
MITCH: How long have you known her?
LYDIA: How long have you known her?
MITCH: I told you. We met yesterday.
LYDIA: In a bird shop.
MITCH: She was selling birds.
LYDIA: She was selling birds.
MITCH: No. I only led her into believing I believed she was. Mother, it's really very complicated.
LYDIA: But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way.
MITCH: Mother, where did you go to law Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like She's very rich, isn't she?
LYDIA: ( laughing ) Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like ( pause ) She's very rich, isn't she?
MITCH: I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
LYDIA: You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
MITCH: I know, Mother.
LYDIA: She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't Yes, Mother.
MITCH: Yes, Mother.
LYDIA: Perhaps I'm old-fashioned. I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but. well. actually. well, the newspaper said she was naked.
MITCH: I know, Mother.
LYDIA: It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
MITCH: ( looking up ) I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
LYDIA: ( looking up ) I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
MITCH: I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
LYDIA: ( she sighs ) So long as you know what you want, I know exactly what I want, Mother.
MITCH: I know exactly what I want, Mother.
DISSOLVE: FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER LAWN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT as Mitch and Melanie cross it to her car. A wind is blowing off the water, and high fast clouds are scudding across the face of the moon.
MITCH: You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
MELANIE: Oh, yes.
MELANIE: Will I be seeing you again?
MELANIE: San Francisco's a long way from here.
MITCH: I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you. Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
MELANIE: How does Mother know what I like to I guess she and I read the same gossip Oh. That. Rome.
MITCH: I guess she and I read the same gossip Oh. That. Rome.
MELANIE: Oh. That. Rome.
MITCH: Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very.
MELANIE: In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
MELANIE: Without any clothes on?
MELANIE: With all my clothes on! The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper. Anything they said.
MITCH: You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
MELANIE: I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular.
MITCH: The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd.
MELANIE: Yes, but.
MITCH: .who didn't much care for propriety or convention or.
MELANIE: .the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
MITCH: .the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
MELANIE: Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
MITCH: Sure. Do you really know Annie At least, I didn't until I came up So you didn't go to school together.
MELANIE: ( pause ) At least, I didn't until I came up So you didn't go to school together.
MITCH: So you didn't go to school together.
MELANIE: And you didn't come up here to see You were lying.
MITCH: And you didn't come up here to see You were lying.
MELANIE: You were lying.
MITCH: You were lying.
MELANIE: Yes, I was lying.
MITCH: Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
MELANIE: I wrote the letter.
MITCH: What did it say?
MELANIE: It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
MITCH: But you tore it up.
MELANIE: Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
MITCH: Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
MELANIE: Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
MITCH: Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
MELANIE: I told you what happened in Rome!
MITCH: Do you expect me to believe.?
MELANIE: I don't give a damn what you believe! Angrily she gets into the car, is about to slam the door when Mitch catches it in his hands.
MITCH: I'd still like to see you.
MELANIE: I think it could be fun.
MITCH: I think it could be fun.
MELANIE: That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
MITCH: It is for me.
MELANIE: But not for me.
MITCH: What do you want ?
MELANIE: ( angrily sarcastic ) I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!

HAYWORTH: In an easy chair, reading. She is wearing a robe and smoking, absorbed in her book. She turns when she hears the front
ANNIE: Miss Daniels? Is that you?
ANNIE: ( seeing her face ) Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
MELANIE: ( touching her head ) No, it's not the cut that's bothering ( concerned ) Would you like some brandy?
ANNIE: ( concerned ) Would you like some brandy?
MELANIE: If you have some, I'd.
ANNIE: I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt? As Annie gets the brandy:
MELANIE: No, thank you. Won't you call me Melanie?
ANNIE: All right. MED. SHOT - MELANIE sitting, tucking her legs up under her. She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact, by the way this entire trip has worked out. Annie brings her the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully.
MELANIE: Thank you.
ANNIE: ( sitting opposite her ) It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay. Melanie nods and sips at the brandy. There is a long pause.
ANNIE: Well, how'd your evening go? Melanie shrugs.
ANNIE: Did you meet Lydia? Melanie nods.
ANNIE: Or would you rather I changed the I think so.
MELANIE: ( with a tired smile ) I think so.
ANNIE: ( nodding ) How do you like our little hamlet?
MELANIE: I despise it.
ANNIE: ( laughing ) Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
MELANIE: Where are you from originally, Annie?
ANNIE: San Francisco.
MELANIE: How'd you happen to come here?
ANNIE: Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago. There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.
ANNIE: Look, I see no reason for being coy about this. It was Mitch Brenner. Melanie nods.
ANNIE: I guess you knew that, anyway.
MELANIE: I suspected as much.
ANNIE: You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
MELANIE: Annie there's nothing between Mitch and me.
ANNIE: Isn't there? Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any What do you mean?
MELANIE: What do you mean?
ANNIE: I think I'll have some of that, too. I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know. And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
MELANIE: When was this?
ANNIE: Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died. Things may be different now.
MELANIE: With Lydia. Did she seem a trifle distant?
ANNIE: With Lydia. Did she seem a trifle distant?
MELANIE: ( smiling ) A trifle.
ANNIE: Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
ANNIE: When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
MELANIE: And what had you done?
ANNIE: Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother. Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
MELANIE: Then what was it?
ANNIE: Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
MELANIE: Then why did she object to you?
ANNIE: Because she was afraid.
MELANIE: Afraid you'd take Mitch?
ANNIE: Afraid I'd give Mitch.
MELANIE: I don't understand.
ANNIE: Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
MELANIE: Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
ANNIE: No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see. She's only afraid of being abandoned.
MELANIE: Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
ANNIE: She already has a daughter.
MELANIE: What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
ANNIE: ( apologetically ) I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
MELANIE: I see.
ANNIE: So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then. but we both knew it was Then what are you doing here in Bodega You get straight to the point, don't I'm sorry. Forgive me.
MELANIE: Then what are you doing here in Bodega You get straight to the point, don't I'm sorry. Forgive me.
ANNIE: You get straight to the point, don't I'm sorry. Forgive me.
MELANIE: I'm sorry. Forgive me.
ANNIE: No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there. well, you know, you probably went to one I did.
MELANIE: I did.
ANNIE: Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.' And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time. That's the first reason.
MELANIE: And the second?
ANNIE: ( simply ) I wanted to be near Mitch. ( pause ) It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway. ( she smiles ) You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship. ever. There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE at the phone.
ANNIE: Hello? Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't asleep. What is it? Yes, just a little while ago. Sure, hold on. It's Mitch. For you.
ANNIE: He's waiting. Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie talks to Mitch in the background. Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.
MELANIE: ( at phone; coolly ) Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, thank you. No, no trouble at all. I simply followed the road. It's a very bright night. ( pause ) What? Oh. Well, there's no need to apologize. I can understand. ( pause; she listens ) ( she listens again ) That's very kind of you. No, I'm not ( she listens ) I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get back to San Francisco. ( pause ) No, I wouldn't want to disappoint Cathy, but. ( pause ) I see. ( she is warming ) I see. Well, if you really. ( pause ) All right. Yes, I'll be there. ( pause ) Good night, Mitch. She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.
MELANIE: He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon. I said I would.
ANNIE: I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
MELANIE: It seems so pointless. I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day. My luggage. She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.
ANNIE: Pretty. Did you get that at Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent for a moment, pensive. Then:
MELANIE: Do you think I should go?
ANNIE: That's up to you.
MELANIE: It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
ANNIE: Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
MELANIE: ( firmly ) Then go. The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.
ANNIE: Then go. The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.
MELANIE: Thank you, Annie. Suddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, startling them both.
ANNIE: ( rising ) Who can that be at this hour? ( she walks to door ) Who is it? ( no answer ) Is someone there? Melanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night. There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.
ANNIE: ( to the emptiness outside ) Is anyone there?
MELANIE: ( pointing to the ground ) CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE ( sympathetically ) Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
ANNIE: ( sympathetically ) Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
MELANIE: But. it isn't dark, Annie. There's a full moon.
FADE OUT: FADE IN HIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn. The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are clustered around a long folding table upon which are sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either helping the children to more or telling them they are having too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background. The CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more, the party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the CAMERA out to the left.

MELANIE: ( hesitating ) On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the Helping travelers.
MITCH: Helping travelers.
MELANIE: She hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really considered before what she does with her time, and now that she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and
MELANIE: And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley. That's not a job, of course. I just take it What about Thursdays and Fridays?
MITCH: What about Thursdays and Fridays?
MELANIE: On Thursdays I have my meeting and I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and. things like that.
MITCH: And Fridays? What do you do then?

MELANIE: ( facetiously ) You'll think me very bold, sir.
MITCH: No, tell me. She leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out LAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into Melanie's face.

Maybe I ought to go join the other FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH as she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where the children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch stares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse of character, and then follows her down the dune. The children are all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold from Michele to Cathy.
ANNIE: All right then, here we go. Three! Go get 'em, Cathy! She says all this while still looking toward the couple. She turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on her face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees. Suddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:
CATHY: No touching allowed! She almost falls.
TWO GULLS: swooping down at the children's heads.
MITCH: Are you all right?
MELANIE: ( coming over ) That's the darnest thing thing I've ever seen in my life.
ANNIE: ( coming over ) That's the darnest thing thing I've ever seen in my life.
LYDIA: Are they gone?

LYDIA: Well. well, is everyone all right?
MITCH: ( with a small boy ) I think he got a little scratch, Did you see them? They were hawks!
GIRL #3: Did you see them? They were hawks!
GIRL #4: They were bigger than hawks!
ANNIE: Children, they were only seagulls. And then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her, and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before.
CATHY: They must have been after the food, They all turn toward the table.
MITCH: They didn't touch anything.
ANNIE: ( trying to restore order ) Well, they're gone now, so. so ( pause ) Who was 'it?' You were 'it,' weren't you, Cathy?

CATHY: Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
MITCH: Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
CATHY: ( seeing the birds ) What's the matter with them? Lydia turns from a side table, where she is cutting some French bread.
LYDIA: What's the matter with all the birds? She covers the cage. Under the cover, the birds are still tweeting madly. Lydia stares at the covered cage for a moment, and then signs heavily.
LYDIA: Hurry up with the rest, Mitch. I'm sure Miss Daniels wants to get on her way. As she moves into the living room.
CATHY: I think you ought to stay the night, INT. LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA a sharp look at her daughter.
CATHY: We've got an extra room upstairs and That road can be a bad one at night, They are now all eating with plates on their knees - buffet If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
MITCH: ( coming in with two plates ) That road can be a bad one at night, ( he picks up coffee cup, hands it to Melanie ) They are now all eating with plates on their knees - buffet If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
MELANIE: If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
LYDIA: ( picking up a cup ) Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
MITCH: Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
CATHY: Did you put the cover on that cage, Yes, I did.
LYDIA: Yes, I did.
CATHY: Just listen to them!
MITCH: ( to Melanie ) Some cream?
MELANIE: I'll get it. She reaches over for the cream pitcher. Her eye is caught by something in the fireplace.
MELANIE: CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE as dozens of swifts begin pouring from the opening.
MELANIE: ( shouting it ) CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE hundreds of birds pouring into the room.
MITCH: ( to the others ) Get outside! Run! ( he turns toward Lydia ) CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA in terror, surrounded by birds.
MITCH: ( shouting ) Cathy, get some matches!
MELANIE: Mitch! The curtains!
CATHY: It's working! The fire's working!
DISSOLVE: INT. BRENNER LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - A HAND reaching down to pick up a dead bird.
MALONE: That's a chimney swift, all right.
MITCH: We know what it is, Al.
MALONE: Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
MITCH: Not by the thousands.
MALONE: No, I gotta admit this is peculiar. Did you have a light burning or Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
MITCH: Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
MALONE: 'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know. Sure is a peculiar thing.
MITCH: What are we going to do about it, I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
MALONE: I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
MITCH: ( he feels a little foolish ) Well. these birds attacked us.
MALONE: What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's CLOSE SHOT - MITCH All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
MITCH: ( still a little hesitant ) All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
MALONE: ( trying to make sense of this ) My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
MALONE: ( shrugs ) Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. ( he shrugs again )
MITCH: These birds were.
MALONE: What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it.
LYDIA: Tell him about the party.
MITCH: That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her Oh, yeah, yeah. How old is she now?
MALONE: Oh, yeah, yeah. How old is she now?
MITCH: Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after.
MALONE: ( thinking ) Were the kids bothering them or something? 'Cause sometimes they'll do that, you know. If you make any kind of disturbance near them, they'll just come after you. I seen that plenty of times myself.
LYDIA: The children were playing a game, Al. Those gulls attacked without.
MALONE: Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty strong word, don't you think? I mean, birds just don't go around attacking people without no reason, you know what I mean? The kids just probably scared them, that's all.
LYDIA: These birds attacked!
MALONE: ( nodding ) Well, what would you like me to do, Lydia? Put out a pick up and hold on any suspicious birds in the area? ( he smiles ) Now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't CLOSE SHOT - MITCH Does this room look silly?
MITCH: Does this room look silly?
MALONE: No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that. Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years. You want some help cleaning up?
MITCH: I can handle it myself.
MELANIE: I'll take Cathy up to bed.
MITCH: Are you staying?
MELANIE: I think I should, don't you?
MELANIE: I'll get my things from the car. Do you want to walk with me, Cathy?
MALONE: Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch.
MITCH: Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
MALONE: Goodnight, Lydia. No answer.
MALONE: Sure is peculiar, I got to say that for it. He exits.
FADE OUT: FADE IN INT. BEDROOM IN BRENNER HOUSE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE Melanie has just gotten out of bed. She is wearing the rather unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store. Her hair is loose. She wears no makeup. She is bent over a lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom. She is busily brushing her teeth. Her head half turns as she HEARS

She wears no makeup. She is bent over a lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom. She is busily brushing her teeth. Her head half turns as she HEARS
LYDIA'S VOICE: Mitch! Mitch! Mitch, I'm going to drop Cathy off now.
MITCH'S VOICE: LYDIA'S VOICE I'll probably drive over to the Fawcett farm. Do you need anything in town?
LYDIA'S VOICE: I'll probably drive over to the Fawcett farm. Do you need anything in town?
MITCH'S VOICE: Melanie finished brushing her teeth. She goes to the window and looks out. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of the pickup truck FULL SHOT - THE YARD BELOW - MELANIE'S P.O.V. as Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck and climbs in. The truck moves out of the yard and down the road. It turns the bend, and moves out of sight.
MELANIE: There is no answer.
MELANIE: FULL SHOT - MELANIE coming down the steps from the attic room. The house is empty. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her into the dining room, where she stops at the cage of lovebirds, bends down to them with a smile on her face.
MELANIE: ( imitating them ) FULL SHOT - MELANIE leaving the cage. She walks to the sideboard upon which is an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall. She feels it with her hand. It is hot. She pours a cup, then peers out of the side window.
SLOW PAN: as Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts the rake down and begins walking toward the house.
MITCH: I wanted to change my shirt. Melanie is uncomprehending.
MITCH: It smelled of the fire.
MELANIE: ( nodding ) It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now. ( pause; then sagely ) I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
MITCH: Really? Tell me about it.
MELANIE: ( secretively ) It's an uprising.
MITCH: Of birds?
MELANIE: Certainly, of birds. Mitch grins.
MELANIE: It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen.
MITCH: Growing a beard.
MELANIE: ( delighted ) Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over.
MITCH: So they united.
MELANIE: Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks.
MITCH: Well, they'll go along with anything.
MELANIE: Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
MITCH: Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
MELANIE: Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
MITCH: Hear, hear!
MELANIE: And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
MITCH: Take wing!
MELANIE: You have nothing to lose but your They both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then laugh again and finally are silent. The garden is deathly What it was, probably.
MITCH: ( attempting to be serious ) What it was, probably.
MELANIE: They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and. and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
MITCH: They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and. and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
MELANIE: With my little sparrow leading team. She laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time. Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror story, they are becoming a little frightened.
MITCH: It's so damn quiet out there.
MELANIE: It was like that yesterday.
MITCH: What do you mean?
MELANIE: After the gulls attacked.
MITCH: I hadn't thought of that. And then the swifts came.
MELANIE: It makes you feel as if they're. they're waiting or. resting. No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and.
MITCH: ( trying to make it light again ) No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and.
MITCH: .waving his little wings. His voice trails. His face becomes serious, too. Again, the garden is silent.
MELANIE: They were angry, Mitch. They came out of the chimney in fury. I had the feeling they wanted each and every one of us dead.
MITCH: Melanie, Melanie.
MELANIE: I'm frightened, Mitch.
MITCH: No, no.
MELANIE: I'm frightened and confused and I. I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and. and concrete and.
MITCH: .everything I know. She looks up at him suddenly.
MELANIE: .everything I know. She looks up at him suddenly.
MELANIE: Oh damn it, why did you have to walk into that shop? They kiss suddenly and fiercely. On their kiss,
DISSOLVE: EXT. FAWCETT FARM - FULL SHOT - THE RED PICKUP TRUCK Lydia at the wheel, pulling into the Fawcett farm, the name of the farm clearly visible on a painted arch over the gate. Lydia gets out of the truck and walks to the front door. She knocks. There is no answer.
LYDIA: She comes down off the steps, the CAMERA FOLLOWING, back a little away from the house.
LYDIA: There is no answer. She shades her eyes and looks out over the fields.
LYDIA: ( shouting ) Hi, there!
LYDIA: ( shouting ) Is Mr. Fawcett home?
FARMHAND: ( shouting back ) I think so, ma'm. His missus is in Santa Cruz, but he ought to be here.
LYDIA: Have you seen him this morning?
LYDIA: ( shouting it ) Thank you!
LYDIA: Here, chick, chick, chick, chick. Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.
LYDIA: She backs away from the house again. The barnyard is silent. In the distance, we can HEAR the SOUND of the tractor.
LYDIA: Dan? Are you home? No answer.
LYDIA: The house is still and silent.
LYDIA: No answer.
LYDIA: Dan? Are you in there? No answer. Lydia puts out her hand, slowly begins showing the door open.
MITCH: ( alarmed ) What is it?
DISSOLVE: INT. BRENNER KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - MELANIE at the kitchen stove, taking a kettle of tea from the burner. She pours it into a cup, puts the cup on a tray already set with sugar and creamer. She looks up as Mitch comes into the TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
MITCH: That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little Will you be all right here?
MELANIE: Yes. I was just taking her in some He goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses her hair. But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder.
MELANIE: Be careful. Please. She walks him to the door. At the door, they kiss a long, full kiss.
MELANIE: No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
LYDIA: Oh, thank you. There is a long silence as Melanie puts the tray on the bed, arranges the pillows behind Lydia.
LYDIA: Where's Mitch?
MELANIE: Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
LYDIA: Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
MELANIE: He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Then he saw.
LYDIA: Then he saw.
MELANIE: He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
LYDIA: What good will they do? She sips at the tea. There is a long awkward pause. Melanie walks to the window and looks out over the bay.
LYDIA: Do you think Cathy's all right?
MELANIE: Cathy. At the school.
LYDIA: Cathy. At the school.
MELANIE: Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
LYDIA: Do I sound foolish to you?
MELANIE: I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face. They have such big windows at the All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
LYDIA: I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face. They have such big windows at the All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
MELANIE: Try not to think of that, Mrs. I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
LYDIA: I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
LYDIA: I lost my husband four years ago, you know. It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep. Do you think Cathy's all right?
MELANIE: Annie's there. She'll be all right.
LYDIA: I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children. When Frank died. You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
MELANIE: I wish I could be that way. There is another silence. A curious thing is happening in this room. Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her husband's death, is discussing it with another person. Curiously, the person is Melanie.
LYDIA: I wish I could be that way. There is another silence. A curious thing is happening in this room. Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her husband's death, is discussing it with another person. Curiously, the person is Melanie.
LYDIA: ( honestly and simply ) I miss him. ( pause ) You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I. I get up and there's a. a very good reason for getting out of bed until. until, of course, I remember. ( pause ) I miss talking to him. ( pause ) Cathy's a child, you know, and ( she shrugs a little sadly ) .Mitch has his own life. ( pause ) I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. ( she sighs deeply )
MELANIE: Would you like to rest now, Mrs. No. No. don't go yet. I feel as if I. I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
LYDIA: No. No. don't go yet. I feel as if I. I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
MELANIE: Why, Mrs. Brenner?
LYDIA: Because my son is. My son seems to be fond of you. And I. I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I. like you or not.
MELANIE: Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
LYDIA: Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he And if you don't?
MELANIE: And if you don't?
LYDIA: ( with a faint smile ) Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
MELANIE: I think it might also matter to Mitch.
LYDIA: ( shaking her head ) Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do. ( pause ) I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man. But. ( pause ) You see, I. I wouldn't want to be. be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone. I. forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset. I. I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't ( going to the bed; adjusting the pillow ) Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. ( sighing ) I wish I were stronger. ( she pauses and looks toward the window. ) Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
MELANIE: ( going to the bed; adjusting the pillow ) Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. ( sighing ) I wish I were stronger. ( she pauses and looks toward the window. ) Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
LYDIA: ( sighing ) I wish I were stronger. ( she pauses and looks toward the window. ) Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
MELANIE: Would you like me to go for her?
LYDIA: I couldn't ask you to.
MELANIE: I don't mind, really.
LYDIA: Would you? I'd feel so much better.
MELANIE: I'll just clear up here, and then She picks up the tray and starts for the door.
LYDIA: At the door, Melanie turns.
LYDIA: ( gently ) Thank you for the tea.
DISSOLVE: EXT. BODEGA BAY - DAY - LONG SHOT Melanie's car turns and goes up School Road.
CLOSE SHOT: Melanie turns back and seats herself on seat in front of play yard.
ANNIE: We're not going outside until we quiet down. Ralph? Did you hear me? The children mutter for a moment, and then are still.
ANNIE: All right now. She begins opening the play yard door. Suddenly, the door from the corridor bursts open, and Melanie rushes wildly INTO the room. She goes directly to Annie, shoves her out of the way, and SLAMS shut the play yard door.
ANNIE: TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE against a background of children's VOICES, as they react to this new excitement.
MELANIE: LONG SHOT - THE CROWS - THROUGH THE WINDOWS TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE Annie gives a quick nod, understanding immediately.

MELANIE: We've got to get the children out of here. These big windows. there's no way to board them up. Annie gives a quick nod, understanding immediately.
ANNIE: Quiet down, children! Quiet down! The children modulate into silence.
ANNIE: Miss Daniels wants to see how we conduct ourselves during a fire drill. I'd like you to.
CHILDREN: ( grumbling in Unison ) A fire drill? This is our play period, Miss Hayworth! Gee whiz! Etc.
ANNIE: I'd like you to show her how quiet and obedient you can be. The children again fall silent.
ANNIE: We're going to go out of the school now. Those of you who live nearby can go directly home. I want the rest of you to go down the hill, all the way to the hotel. Do you All the way down the hill? Gee, Miss Hayworth, we never. Home? Why do I want you to go as quietly as you can, not a sound, until I tell you to run. And then I want you to run as fast as you can. Does everyone All right. John, would you lead the class, please? The children walk two-by-two to the corridor door. John opens it, and they begin filing out. Melanie turns to look at the play yard.

DISSOLVE: INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT It is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as DEKE CARTER officiates behind the bar and HELEN CARTER, his wife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables. A DRUNK sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of booze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and efficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another table, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing and clowning around throughout following at a table in the rear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens. Over her head, the television set is blasting with its perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation.
MELANIE: Daddy, there were hundreds of them. No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying to tell you this as calmly as I know how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy. Just now. Not. fifteen minutes The door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wearing walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what Melanie is saying.
MELANIE: At the school. No, I don't. Just a What's the name of the school?
DEKE: Just the Bodega Bay School. Help you, Mrs. Bundy?
MRS. BUNDY: I need some change, Mr. Carter. As Deke opens cash register.
MELANIE: The Bodega Bay School. Could you turn that down, please? Deke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television.
MELANIE: I don't know how many children. Thirty or forty. Yes. Mrs. Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
MELANIE: No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
MRS. BUNDY: ( turning from machine ) There is very definitely a difference, They're different, Daddy. ( to Mrs. Bundy ) Thank you. ( into phone ) I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them. ( exasperated ) Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm. all right, all right. ( pause ) No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean. are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope. ( pause ) I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by. She hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow.
MELANIE: They're different, Daddy. Thank you. I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.

Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow.
MRS. BUNDY: They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
MELANIE: Thank you. Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
DEKE: In the book right here, Miss. As Melanie looks it up.
DEKE: ( to Mrs. Bundy ) I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
MRS. BUNDY: ( with a superior smile ) I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such.
MELANIE: ( dialing ) I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who.
MRS. BUNDY: Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who.
HELEN: ( going to door leading to kitchen ) Three Southern fried chicken, Sam. Baked potato on all of them. LAUGHTER from salesman at table.

DEKE: Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
MRS. BUNDY: ( in background ) Mitch? I'm glad I caught you. Something terrible has happened. Her background conversation continues through following:
MELANIE: ( in background ) Mitch? I'm glad I caught you. Something terrible has happened. Her background conversation continues through following:
DRUNK: ( suddenly ) It's the end of the world!
HELEN: What's this about the school?
DEKE: Bunch of crows attacked the school, It's the end of the world. "Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high The Lord's not destroying anything, "In all your dwelling places, the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be laid waste!"

DRUNK: "In all your dwelling places, the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be laid waste!" Ezekiel, Chapter six.
HELEN: ( quoting ) "Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink."
DRUNK: ( nodding ) Isaiah, Chapter 5. It's the end of the world.
MELANIE: Yes, all right, I'll wait for you.
MRS. BUNDY: ( laughing ) I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
MELANIE: ( turning to her ) These weren't a few birds.
DEKE: I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded.
MRS. BUNDY: The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded.
SHOLES: ( suddenly, from his table ) How many gulls did you count, Mrs. BACK TO SCENE Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
MRS. BUNDY: Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
SHOLES: The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
MRS. BUNDY: Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or.
MELANIE: ( leaping upon this ) Have you had trouble with gulls?
SHOLES: One of my boats did last week.
DEKE: ( making a connection ) This young lady got hit by a gull only Saturday.
SAM'S VOICE: ( from kitchen ) Pick up the chicken.
HELEN: Now it's gulls. A minute ago, it was Deke, I'm still waiting for those Bloody Marys!
DEKE: Coming right up!
WOMAN: Could you ask them to lower their voices, please? They're frightening the children.
LITTLE GIRL: Timmy has a canary.
HELEN: That's nice. Are you Timmy?
LITTLE BOY: My cousin is Timmy.
SAM'S VOICE: ( leaving table, coming to bar ) A whole flock of gulls nearby capsized one of my boats. Practically tore of the skipper's arm.
HELEN: ( coming back ) You're scaring the kids. Keep it You're scaring me, too. Are you trying to say all these. ( he shakes his head ) That sounds impossible, Sebastian.
DEKE: You're scaring me, too. Are you trying to say all these. That sounds impossible, Sebastian.
SHOLES: I'm only telling you what happened to my boat.
MRS. BUNDY: The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
MELANIE: What were the crows after at the What do you think they were after, Daniels. I think they were after the For what purpose?
MRS. BUNDY: What do you think they were after, Daniels. I think they were after the For what purpose?
MELANIE: Daniels. I think they were after the For what purpose?
MRS. BUNDY: For what purpose?
MELANIE: ( she hesitates ) To kill them. There is a long silence.
MRS. BUNDY: Another silence.
MELANIE: I don't know why.
MRS. BUNDY: I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago! A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens.
MRS. BUNDY: Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a. a war against humanity?
MELANIE: No one called it a war!
SALESMAN: Scotch, light on the water.
MRS. BUNDY: You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
HELEN: Are you finished here, Sebastian?
SHOLES: Let me have some apple pie, Helen. Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls.
HELEN: ( yelling to kitchen ) One apple pie! You want more coffee?
SHOLES: No. .came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
SALESMAN: Your captain should have shot at Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most birds are. If you ask me, we should wipe them all out. World would be better off without them.
SHOLES: Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most birds are. If you ask me, we should wipe them all out. World would be better off without them.
SALESMAN: Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most birds are. If you ask me, we should wipe them all out. World would be better off without them.
MRS. BUNDY: ( outraged ) Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
SALESMAN: Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
MRS. BUNDY: We need them.
SALESMAN: Not if they're starting a war.
MRS. BUNDY: They are incapable of organized Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
MELANIE: Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
MRS. BUNDY: I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between.
MELANIE: Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and.
MRS. BUNDY: Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the That would hardly be possible.
MELANIE: I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the That would hardly be possible.
SALESMAN: Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the That would hardly be possible.
MRS. BUNDY: That would hardly be possible.
DEKE: Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
MRS. BUNDY: Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world.
SALESMAN: ( muttering ) Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
MRS. BUNDY: .probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
DRUNK: It's the end of the world!
DEKE: Well, we seem to have more than our share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy. Maybe this young lady's right. Maybe they've all gone crazy.
HELEN: Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
SHOLES: No. Here's fine.
HELEN: Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
DEKE: ( angrily ) Are we running a business here or a bird sanctuary?
HELEN: ( angrily ) Are we running a business here or a bird sanctuary?
SHOLES: ( beginning to change his mind ) Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
MRS. BUNDY: Of course.
SHOLES: Makes a lot more sense than. well, an attack.
MRS. BUNDY: Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why. why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of.
DRUNK: Cockroaches! Urghh!
WOMAN: Hurry, children. Finish your lunch.
BOY: Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?
SHOLES: Maybe we're all getting a little carried away by this. Admittedly, a few birds acted strangely. That's no reason to believe.
MELANIE: This isn't a few birds! I keep telling you that! These are gulls and swifts and crows and.
MRS. BUNDY: And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
MELANIE: Maybe! Is it impossible?
MRS. BUNDY: Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable. Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
SHOLES: We couldn't. You're right, Mrs. Excuse me, may I have a check, please?
WOMAN: ( calling from table ) Excuse me, may I have a check, please?
HELEN: ( concerned ) Is everything all right, ma'am?
WOMAN: Yes, I. I'm anxious to get on the What's the matter? Something wrong out here?
SAM: ( coming from kitchen ) What's the matter? Something wrong out here?
DEKE: Nothing's wrong.
SAM: All this shouting.
MRS. BUNDY: We're fighting a war, Sam.
SAM: A war? Against who? Did the Against birds.
SHOLES: Against birds.
WOMAN: ( suddenly ) I'm glad you all think this is so amusing. You've frightened my children half out of their wits.
BOY: I'm not scared, Mommy.
WOMAN: Keep quiet. If that young lady saw an attack on the school, why won't you believe her?
SAM: What attack? Who attacked the school?
WOMAN: Birds did. Crows! And you're all sitting around here debating! What do you want them to do next? Crash through that window?
LITTLE GIRL: ( frightened by her mother ) Quiet! Why don't you all get home? Lock your doors and windows! ( her hysteria rising ) Put on your coats, children! ( to Deke ) What's the fastest road to San The freeway, ma'am.
WOMAN: Quiet! Why don't you all get home? Lock your doors and windows! Put on your coats, children! What's the fastest road to San The freeway, ma'am.
DEKE: The freeway, ma'am.
WOMAN: Where do I get it?
SALESMAN: I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
WOMAN: Then let's go. Now!
SALESMAN: I haven't finished my drink.
WOMAN: ( on edge of panic, shouting at her children ) Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
BOY: I can't find my scarf.
WOMAN: Look in your sleeve! The door opens. Mitch and Al Malone come in.
MITCH: At the far table, the salesman begin singing, rowdily.
MITCH: ( going to her ) I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
MELANIE: At Annie's house. She's all right.
SAM: Al, why aren't you over there where the attack was?
MALONE: Because I just got back from Dan Fawcett's place, that's why.
MITCH: He was killed last night. By birds.
MALONE: Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
MRS. BUNDY: What are the facts, Mr. Malone?
MALONE: Santa Rosa police think it was a felony murder. They think a burglar broke in and killed him.
WOMAN: Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today? Are you coming?
SALESMAN: Take it easy, lady. There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
DRUNK: ( quoting ) "Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow or read, yet your heavenly father feeds them."
WOMAN: I'll never feed another bird as long as I live!
SALESMAN: Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
WOMAN: Can't you please finish your drink?
MRS. BUNDY: That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
SALESMAN: They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything. They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
MRS. BUNDY: The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
WOMAN: I'm leaving! Are you coming?
SALESMAN: All right, all right! Hope you figure this out, folks.
DRUNK: It's the end of the world. The Tides is silent for a moment.
SHOLES: Well, I'd better get back to the cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?
DEKE: Let's see. Scallops and coffee.
MITCH: Hold it just a minute, Sebastian. Sholes turns to him.
MITCH: Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
SHOLES: No one ever said you were, Mitch.
MITCH: ( flatly ) I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
MRS. BUNDY: ( sarcastically ) Ignore what? The bird war?
MITCH: ( exploding ) Yes, the bird war, the bird attack, the bird plague, you can call it what you want to, they're out there massing someplace and they'll be back, you can count on that!
MRS. BUNDY: Mrs. Bundy, why don't you go home and polish your binoculars?
MITCH: Mrs. Bundy, why don't you go home and polish your binoculars?
SAM: Go on, Mitch.
MITCH: If we don't do something now, if we don't get Bodega Bay on the move.
SHOLES: Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds.
MITCH: Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
SHOLES: ( after a long pause ) No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
MITCH: It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
SHOLES: ( thoughtfully ) I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought. ( he shakes his head )
MITCH: Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
SHOLES: Help how? What do you want to do?
MITCH: I'm not sure, but.
SHOLES: If you don't even know what you want to do.
MELANIE: Listen to him, please.
SAM: ( taking position beside Melanie ) You listen to him, Sebastian!
MITCH: I only know we've got to drive them away from town before they drive us away.
SHOLES: Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
MITCH: Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
DEKE: We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
MITCH: We'll make our own fog.
SHOLES: How do you plan to do that?
MITCH: With smoke.
MALONE: There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's.
MITCH: We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
DEKE: What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
MRS. BUNDY: Birds are not bad!
SHOLES: How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
MITCH: Can we go on living here otherwise? Pause. They are silent.
SAM: ( slowly ) It's worth a try, Sebastian. There is more silence as they all consider. And then suddenly:
MELANIE: They turn toward the window.
DEKE: ( alarmed ) They're back!
MITCH: They're back!
SHOLES: They're only the usual. What are TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT The first gull reaches the gas station but misses the attendant who is in the act of filling the car. The owner is seen disappearing into the men's room.
MITCH: ( to Melanie ) Stay back in here. Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch. They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to rescue the attacked gas station attendant. Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks TIDES CAR PARK - MED. SHOT on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is flowing to the right into the car park.
MELANIE: Mitch.! Mitch! We see her look up to the sky.
CLOSER SHOT: A side view of the car after practically scraping the side of the booth. We see that it's full of birds attacking the driver. As it goes by, it near tilts over to inadvertently give us a view of its interior.
CLOSER SHOT: shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping. At one moment the water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows of the phone booth.
CLOSER SHOT: The moment the child has dropped, Mitch suddenly looks up. He slams the window as two or three birds crash into the windows. They disappear into the building.
LOW SHOT: close to the Tides Restaurant entrance. We see Mitch drag Melanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the CAMERA through the birds into the restaurant.
WOMAN: Why are they doing it?! Why are they doing it.?! Some of the heads of the group turn.
CLOSE SHOT: It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs. Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and helpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some
MRS. BUNDY: ( [Mrs. Bundy offers a weak explanation of why the birds could have gone berserk like this. This information should be obtained from Dr. Stager.] )
MITCH: ( looking up ) I think they're going. Melanie follows his look. At this moment there is a loud CRASH OF GLASS. They turn their heads suddenly.
MITCH: I think it's safe to get out now.
MELANIE: Don't let's take any chances.
MITCH: We've got to get Cathy. They open the door and make their way out into the street, running and looking about them desperately.
MELANIE'S VOICE: Look. the crows again.
MELANIE: Careful, Mitch. The crows may be back in the play yard.
MED. SHOT: THE CAMERA DOLLIES along the play yard. It is again full of CLOSE SHOT They walk stealthily past.
CLOSE SHOT: They walk stealthily past.
CLOSE SHOT: CAMERA PANNING ALONG the waiting crows.
CLOSE SHOT: Shooting over the shoulders of Melanie and Mitch, they approach Annie's house. Melanie glances apprehensively over her shoulder toward the crows.
MELANIE: ( as the birds flutter into the air ) Mitch! Don't! She runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he maniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are now hovering flight.
MELANIE: Please! Get Cathy! Let's get out of Her words reach him. Breathing heavily, he goes INTO the house and COMES OUT carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a state of shock. The CAMERA PANS him over to Melanie who holds Cathy to her.
MELANIE: Mitch, you can't leave her out there. He GOES OUT OF PICTURE. Melanie watches him. Over her shoulder is the white face of Cathy. We HEAR a DRAGGING SOUND and then a door is CLOSED.
MED. SHOT: He joins Melanie and Cathy. The CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of the three of them as they silently make their way past the crows once more, Melanie holding Cathy close to her. They look out cautiously to the right.
MED. SHOT: CAMERA DOLLYING PAST the crows again.
MED. SHOT: Another DOLLY SHOT past the crows.
MED. SHOT: They arrive at the car.
MELANIE: You drive, Mitch. She goes round the far side and gets into the car. Mitch slips in behind the driver's seat. The car turns into the CAMERA and goes down the school road.
MELANIE: ( holding her breath ) I don't think they're coming. Cathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes wide, her lip trembling. They drive in silence, and then suddenly, Cathy begins speaking, almost as if to herself, as the CAMERA COMES IN TIGHT on her face in shock.
CATHY: On our way back from taking Michele home. we. we heard the explosion and went outside to. see what. what it was. All at once the. the birds were everywhere. All at once. She. she pushed me inside and. they covered She pushed me inside.
DISSOLVE: CLOSE SHOT - A LONE GULL flying low over the water, the CAMERA TRACKING it. The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the Brenner house in the distance.
MELANIE: The town looks clear.
MITCH: The bay doesn't.
MELANIE: How long have they been gathering The past fifteen minutes. It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again. Melanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay.
MITCH: The past fifteen minutes. It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again. Melanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay.
MELANIE: I keep thinking of Annie.
MITCH: ( after a long pause ) It. it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise.
MELANIE: ( looking ) Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
MITCH: It may not be last week again for a long long time. They are both silent.
MELANIE: Look. They're still coming. Mitch nods. Silence.
MITCH: Do you want to try your father again?
MELANIE: I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
MITCH: Have we still got power?
MELANIE: ( leaning against him ) I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very Mitch! I'm getting something on the INT. THE LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT Lydia is hovering near the radio. Cathy is sitting on a footstool. The windows are boarded, and the lights in the room are on. A tremendous amount of static is coming from the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them
LYDIA: I can't get any of the local stations. I think this is San Francisco.
ANNOUNCER: .would include formulation of a central financing committee to handle credit and to allocate responsibility for the various facets of the project. A vote on the motion is expected early tomorrow morning.
ANNOUNCER: Continuing with the local news, police are still investigating the series of valuable jade burglaries in the Chinatown area. The round-up of known criminals has not as yet produced a suspect, but Commissioner Nelson said today he was certain the burglaries were quote linked and the work of the team of professionals In Bodega Bay early this morning, a large flock of crows attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill. One little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but the majority of children reached safety in the town. On the national scene today, the opening of the new session of Congress was marked by a State of the Union address that.
MITCH: Is that all?
MITCH: ( sighing ) We're going to need more wood for the fire. We can't let it go out.
ANNOUNCER: ( continuing as drone in background ) The goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states. This is our guide for the present and our vision for the future a free community of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north and south, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age. We will not reach that goal today or tomorrow. We may not reach it in our lifetime. But the quest is the great adventure of our century. We sometimes chafe at the burdens of our obligations, the complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices, but there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility. ( pause ) In assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that few generations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger. This is our good fortune, and I welcome it now as I did when I first took office. ( pause ) For it is the fate of this generation Of you in the Congress and of me as President to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did - not make. But the pressures of life are not always distributed by choice. And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been ready to seize the burden and the glory of.
LYDIA: ( pause ) Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
MITCH: I got them all, Mother.
LYDIA: When do you think they'll come?
MITCH: I don't know.
LYDIA: If there are. larger birds, Mitch. they'll get into the house.
MITCH: That's a chance we have to take.
LYDIA: Maybe we ought to leave.
MITCH: Not now. Not while they're massing out there.
LYDIA: I don't know when. We'll see what.
MITCH: I don't know when. We'll see what.
LYDIA: Where will we go?
MITCH: I don't know yet. I think we'll be safe here. Let's bring that wood in.
LYDIA: What happens when we run out of wood? Music begins to play. The music is sweet, with violins and long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the tension being played in front of it.
MITCH: I don't know. We'll break up the You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
LYDIA: ( shouting ) You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
CATHY: ( shrieking it, her face white ) ( at Mitch ) If your father were here.
LYDIA: ( at Mitch ) If your father were here.
MITCH: ( sharply ) Mother! I'm trying my best! ( shaking his head ) I'm. trying. my.
LYDIA: ( trembling, nodding ) I'm sorry, Mitch.
MITCH: Let's get the wood. Why don't you make us all some coffee, Mother?
MELANIE: Where are they heading?
MITCH: Santa Rosa?
MELANIE: Santa Rosa?
MITCH: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE watching the birds. A look of utter sadness crosses her face. It is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach Santa Rosa, and eventually San Francisco as well.
DISSOLVE: FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM Lydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we can HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the sound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch. There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights, kerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace putting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room and dumps another load.
MELANIE: That's the last of it.
LYDIA: Did you close the door?
MELANIE: And locked it.
CATHY: Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in Mom, they're in a cage!
LYDIA: ( snapping it ) Mom, they're in a cage!
CATHY: Mom, they're in a cage!
LYDIA: They're birds!
MITCH: ( softly ) Let them stay in the other room.
CATHY: Mitch? Why are they doing this? The I don't know, honey.
MITCH: ( putting wood on fire ) I don't know, honey.
CATHY: Why are they trying to kill people?
MITCH: I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people. The room is silent again except for the TWEETING of the lovebirds offscreen. And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall CLOSE SHOT - CATHY turning to look toward the other room, her face going white, her eyes widening.
LYDIA: Shhh. Shhh. Silence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING, the THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence. More panes of glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards and the outside of the house begins building, almost like muffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm. Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, is the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section entering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA looking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She squeezes her eyes shut.
MITCH: Shhh. Shhh. Silence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING, the THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence. More panes of glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards and the outside of the house begins building, almost like muffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm. Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, is the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section entering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA looking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She squeezes her eyes shut.
CATHY: ( in terror ) I'm. I'm sick, Melanie. I want.. I want to throw. Her face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom.
MELANIE: I'll go with you. They leave the room. Mitch and Lydia sit in silence. We HEAR Cathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling of wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of birds striking the house.
MELANIE: When will they stop?
MITCH: I thought they'd have stopped by What time is it?
MELANIE: What time is it?
MITCH: Almost two a.m.
MELANIE: You must be exhausted.
MITCH: How about you? She shakes her head. They both move into the dining room, the CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their cage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready to carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the chair, goes to the cage.
MITCH: I wonder if Cathy fed them. He turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door, takes out a small box of bird feed.
MITCH: ( holding her ) You should have left when you wanted She shakes her head.
MITCH: You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
MELANIE: I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you. There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like a small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close, Mitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of night sort of way. And suddenly. The lights go out.
MITCH: ( in the darkness ) The power.
MELANIE: Wait here. Don't move. The screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the blackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the SOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH as he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as he directs the beam upwards.
MITCH: Wait here. Don't move. The screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the blackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the SOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH as he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as he directs the beam upwards.
MITCH: We'd better light some of those lamps.
MELANIE: No. wait. Hold me. In the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. It is almost black in the room except for the strange effect of the flashlight as he holds it behind her.
MITCH: I think they're easing off.
DISSOLVE: FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM A kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the fire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep on the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs. Mitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly and steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer the sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another SOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a steady dribbling, difficult to place.
MELANIE: ( whispering ) MED. SHOT - MELANIE as she turns toward him.
MELANIE: ( still whispering ) CLOSE SHOT - MITCH CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE seeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming from somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep, picks up a very long flashlight.
MITCH: Mother, get a rope!
LYDIA: Oh, my God, look at her!
MITCH: ( shouting ) Get a rope! She rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds. There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his hand, knocking the club from it.
MITCH: ( yelling ) Mother! Hurry!
MITCH: Cathy! Get a blanket and some Is she all right?
CATHY: ( at the foot of the stars, on the verge of tears ) Is she all right?
MELANIE: I'm. I'm..
MITCH: Just lie there and keep still. Cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket. By the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over Melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands are trembling, and he drops it.
LYDIA: Let me do that, Mitch. She picks up the bandage.
MITCH: I can handle it.
LYDIA: I know you can. But I'd like to. He nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.
MELANIE: ( weakly ) Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
LYDIA: Shhhh. Shhhh.
MELANIE: But she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the cuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.
LYDIA: ( as she works ) I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
MITCH: You're doing fine.
LYDIA: ( Apologizing ) I mean. I want to. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA raising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to They're gone. God have mercy, they're FULL SHOT - MITCH as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the table and chair. He opens the door a crack.
CATHY: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA raising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to FULL SHOT - MITCH as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the table and chair. He opens the door a crack.
LYDIA: They're gone. God have mercy, they're FULL SHOT - MITCH as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the table and chair. He opens the door a crack.
MITCH: They're gone. The same pattern.
LYDIA: But they'll be back.
MITCH: We won't be here.
LYDIA: Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
MITCH: I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
LYDIA: ( shaking her head ) We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
MITCH: We have to try it. We can't stay here. Melanie needs help. Mother, the house won't take another If. when we get to San Francisco. If they're already there?
LYDIA: ( pause ) If. when we get to San Francisco. ( pause ) If they're already there?
MITCH: They won't be.
LYDIA: If they are?
MITCH: We'll worry about that when we get I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I. I don't know what's out there, What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
LYDIA: I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I. I don't know what's out there, What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
MITCH: What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
LYDIA: ( nodding; then after a pause ) I started to say. inside.
MITCH: You don't have to. He holds out his hand to her.
MITCH: I think we'd better get started.
DISSOLVE: FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD It is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before dawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following until the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is deafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's convertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house together and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the back seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background is the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking down at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the CLOSE SHOT - CATHY She is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just outside the doorway. She looks at Mitch.
CATHY: May I take them, Mitch? He does not answer. She continues looking at him.
CATHY: They haven't harmed anyone.
LYDIA: Take them.
MITCH: ( with a slow nod ) We'll put them in the trunk, Cathy. He takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car. The CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front seat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops, and looks toward the trees.
MITCH: Be careful with that door. Cathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch does the same with his door.
MELANIE: ( weakly ) Mitch, if they hear the car starting. if they see movement.
MITCH: We'll take it slow until we get to the main road. Are you ready?
MITCH: All right. Here we go.
MITCH: Shhh. Shhhh.
CATHY: ( whispering ) Mitch, let's turn back.
MITCH: Shhh. Shhhhh.
LYDIA: MED. SHOT - MITCH as he stops the car and looks ahead.
MELANIE: Can we turn back?
MITCH: I. I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR There is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing, who makes the decision.
MELANIE: Then go ahead, Mitch.
MITCH: ( almost as a prayer ) Here we go. ( he rams down on the accelerator )
MELANIE: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH wrenching at the wheel as the car turns a bend.
LYDIA: ( almost a prayer ) Dear God. dear God. please, please, what have we done? Please. ( and then in anger at the roof and the birds ) Can't they leave us alone? ( shrieking it )
LYDIA: We're losing them.
CATHY: Mitch? Do. do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they I think they'll be all right, honey. There is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the wind. Not a wild exuberance, but a relaxation of tension. They stare ahead through the windshield, and then they squint their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead, and Mitch reaches up to turn down the sun visor.
MITCH: ( with the faintest smile ) I think they'll be all right, honey. There is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the wind. Not a wild exuberance, but a relaxation of tension. They stare ahead through the windshield, and then they squint their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead, and Mitch reaches up to turn down the sun visor.
MITCH: It looks. it looks clear up ahead.
