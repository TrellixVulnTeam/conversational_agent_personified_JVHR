ZOEY: Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure. Toute la nuit pour 700. D'avance. Et faudra porter un
ZED: I.don't speak French.
ZOEY: It's okay.
ZOEY: It will be one thousand francs for all night. In advance.
ZOEY: We can do it now if you want.
ZED: Well, let me just dry up.
ZOEY: Okay, but it's not necessary.
ZOEY: Zoe or Zoey. Which ever you like.
ZOEY: ( smiling at this ) That's funny. We both have Z names.
ZED: What was that?
ZOEY: You can take those off. The pants.
ZED: I'd rather watch you get undressed first.
ZOEY: ( matter-of-factly )
ZED: He lays down on the bed. She stands there looking at him and then smiles.
ZOEY: Alright Mister America. Zed.
ZOEY: Slow enough for you?
ZOEY: C'etait formidable.
ZOEY: I'm cold.
ZOEY: Moises told me you were in town for What kind of business?
ZED: Moises told me you were in town for What kind of business?
ZOEY: Moises told me you were in town for What kind of business?
ZED: What kind of business?
ZOEY: What kind of business?
ZED: I don't know. I'm just curious.
ZOEY: I don't know. I'm just curious.
ZED: Do you ask all your clients questions?
ZOEY: No. Just the ones I like.
ZED: So you like me?
ZOEY: Because you're.a good person. I run into some real creeps. You know.
ZED: Because you're.a good person. I run into some real creeps. You know.
ZOEY: Because you're.a good person. I run into some real creeps. You know.
ZED: How do you know I'm a good person?
ZOEY: Body language. We fit together.
ZED: All men and women fit together. Hell, even some men fit together.
ZOEY: No, but you know, we clicked. You made me orgasm. Do you know how often I orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with?
ZED: No I don't.
ZOEY: Usually never. They're almost always fat like pigs.
ZOEY: And you make me feel safe. That's something more important than the orgasm. An integral part maybe of the orgasm.
ZED: I never really thought of it like that.
ZOEY: Well, it's true.
ZOEY: Turn off the television.
ZOEY: So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like you very much.
ZED: Well, I like you too Zoe.
ZOEY: He nods.
ZOEY: Why? For the same reason? Any man can orgasm. Even with his own hand.
ZED: Well, I like your honesty. You're open. Unlike most prostitutes I've been with.
ZOEY: I am not a prostitute!
ZED: Really? Can I have my francs back then?
ZOEY: I'm a student. And to pay for the classes I became an escort. It's my choice to sleep with you.
ZED: I see.
ZOEY: What? You don't understand.
ZED: No, I do.
ZOEY: Hey, it's not easy.
ZED: I didn't say it was.
ZOEY: I'm here because I want to.
ZED: Okay, okay relax. What school do you go The Centre du Art, Paris.
ZOEY: The Centre du Art, Paris.
ZED: That's really interesting. What kind of art do you study?
ZOEY: Not any of the old shit.
ZED: I have a day job too. Three times a
ZOEY: I have a day job too. Three times a
ZOEY: But someday there will be only my art.
ZED: What kind of things do you paint?
ZOEY: I don't paint. I make things. Objects. Not like sculpture. Like life.but with no narrative. I want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world. Void of feeling, emotion.void of destiny. Those are left for me. They belong only to me. If someone else can see into it.then it is no longer mine. I have failed. And I would destroy it. I don't care how much cash they would offer me. It would be shit. I can't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed. They told too much about me. And if someone wants to know something about me.I'll tell them myself. The way I'm telling you.
ZOEY: What I do I do only for the objects.
ZED: I'd like to see one of these.
ZOEY: What? So you could see the work of a
ZED: Zoey. I'm sorry for calling you a prostitute. I didn't understand the The difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm.
ZOEY: The difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm.
ZED: If these things you make are as true as you are.I'm sure they're as indescribable. Perhaps, someday, you'll make one.about me.
ZOEY: If I do.you'll never know which one it is. Because I'll be the only one who understands. I'll be the only one who can look into it and see where in my life it came from.
ZOEY: ( groggily ) What time is it?
ZED: I have no idea. Night time.
ZOEY: I'm going to take a shower.
ERIC: ( with a thick accent ) Hey you madman!
ZED: Eric. Come in.
ERIC: What happened to you? I thought you were going to call.
ERIC: ( smiling ) Oh I see. You have been busy.
ZED: Sorry, I asked the hotel to give me a wake up call.
ERIC: That's good, but now I am here. So let's go. We have a lot to talk about.
ZED: What about the girl?
ERIC: Is she your girlfriend?
ZED: Fuck her.
ERIC: Fuck her.
ERIC: She's a dishrag whore. Kick her out.
ZED: I'll let her stay here tonight.
ERIC: Don't be silly. It's dangerous.
ERIC: ( in French with English [Okay. Get out of the shower. It's time for you to leave.]
ZOEY: [Fuck you.]
ERIC: [No. Come on you fucking slut!]
ZOEY: [Let go of me you shit!!]
ZED: ( to Zed ) Don't worry about her. ( to Zoey in French ) [Why don't you just go back to your pimp and suck his black dick!]
ERIC: ( to Zed ) Don't worry about her. ( to Zoey in French ) [Why don't you just go back to your pimp and suck his black dick!]
ERIC: God damn it!
ERIC: [Get the fuck out of here you fucking
ZOEY: [Give me my clothes you asshole!]
ERIC: ( looking at his hand wound ) God damn it. Look at my hand.
ZED: ( shocked at the whole incident ) Jesus Eric.
ERIC: Oh shit. Her clothes. Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard!?
ZOEY: ( almost too quick to Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard!?
ERIC: La ferme!
ERIC: So tell me, what have you been up to?
ZED: Eric, I liked that girl.
ERIC: Oh. Well, then why didn't you stop me.
ZED: Because you were on a rampage.
ERIC: Look, your whole life you've done nothing but fuck whores. A girl like that will give you AIDS. Why don't you find a nice girl in the suburbs?
ZED: Because when you need to get off you don't want to have to date for months to do it.
ERIC: Just use your hand like me.
ZED: Sometimes you just need honesty.and I don't understand. Anyway, it's too late. Get dressed, let's go out and meet the boys.
ERIC: I don't understand. Anyway, it's too late. Get dressed, let's go out and meet the boys.
ZED: Okay, let me take a shower.
ERIC: No, in Paris it's good to smell like you've been fucking. It will make them respect you.
ZED: Just put on a shirt and a sport coat.
ERIC: Just put on a shirt and a sport coat.
ERIC: I'm glad you came. How long has it been?
ZED: It's amazing, you know? Here you are. One day in America. Now here.
ERIC: It's amazing, you know? Here you are. One day in America. Now here.
ZED: Well, to be honest there really wasn't much happening for me in the states.
ERIC: But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job for you, so you came. That's good.
ZED: How could I resist your invitation?
ERIC: You would have been stupid to.
ZED: So what have you been doing here?
ERIC: After school I spent some time in Algeria studying African philosophy. And then I bummed around. You know. For fun. For a while I worked at Le Figaro. The Yes. With an assumed Masters degree. And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris. You know, like
ZED: Yes. With an assumed Masters degree. And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris. You know, like
ERIC: Yes. With an assumed Masters degree. And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris. You know, like
ERIC: It's fun.
ERIC: The people next door are on holiday. We took their phone. If you want to make a long distance call, go ahead.
ZED: Is that cat dead?
ERIC: I don't know. I think it's asleep but it's been there for days.
ERIC: I guess it is dead.
ERIC: They all return the greeting.
ERIC: ( to Zed ) Okay. This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Oliver, and Claude. Got it?
ZED: I will.
ERIC: They all know who you are. Ne soyez pa salauds. Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres.
OLIVER: ( with an English accent ) Zed, would you like a beer?
ZED: Don't think of it.
OLIVER: Don't think of it.
CLAUDE: ( to Zed ) Come. Sit down.
CLAUDE: ( to Zed ) Easy. Don't scare him. He just wants to claim you.
CLAUDE: Let me introduce you properly. This is
CLAUDE: He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we don't always get what we like.do we?
CLAUDE: ( to Enrique ) ( then to Zed ) Do you like hash?
ERIC: ( jokingly ) Don't sit next to that junkie.
CLAUDE: Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a mass of sparks. They laugh.
ERIC: ( to Claude ) That little shit monkey of yours pissed on my Billy Holiday albums. Next time he's out the door. ( to Zed ) Zed, come here.
OLIVER: Here you go mate.
ZED: Oliver sits down next to Claude.
ERIC: Don't ask me where we got this.
ZED: On Bastille Day, all the banks are
ERIC: On Bastille Day, all the banks are
ERIC: But this one. BIP. The Banque Internationale de Paris. And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next Bastille day. Yes?
ERIC: We will go in and shut the bank down. Now, look at this.
ERIC: As you can see, only one person can start the alarm. The concierge, at this desk. We will take care of him. Then we can close the bank. No one will know the difference since every other bank will be Are you sure he won't push the alarm?
ZED: ( turning the schematic around ) Are you sure he won't push the alarm?
ERIC: Ahhh! He's right next to the door. We'd have to be totally incompetent not to stop him. Don't worry about that.
ERIC: Here. This is where they keep the days reserve cash. Okay fuck that.
ERIC: There are many vaults downstairs, but this is the vault we must get into. This is where the real prize is.
ZED: What kind of vault is that?
ERIC: Ah.Swiss made. A Caliber.
ZED: ( he thinks about it ) It'll take three hours.
ERIC: No, that's too long.
ZED: That's how long it'll take.
ERIC: Well shit. It's too long. We have to be in and out. Like that. Or there will be suspicion. A little time is okay.but too long
ZED: Well hold on a second. What's this?
ERIC: Another vault.
ZED: No this.
ERIC: I don't know.it connects the two Well, what kind of vault is this other Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.
ZED: Well, what kind of vault is this other Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.
ERIC: ( reading the blueprint ) Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.
ZED: Why would those two vaults be connected?
ERIC: I don't know.
ZED: Because I can get into this vault in half an hour. Maybe less.
ERIC: But this entry way is too small to get the platen out. We have a lot of merchandise in there.
ZED: No, don't you see? We get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault. From the inside I could open the Caliber vault in five minutes.
ERIC: You could open it in five minutes?
ZED: From the inside it's easy.
ERIC: ( excited ) Hot damn. That is our answer.
ZED: Okay. When is Bastille day?
ERIC: Tomorrow!? We're doing this tomorrow?
ZED: Tomorrow!? We're doing this tomorrow?
ERIC: But of course.
ZED: It's impossible.
ERIC: It's not impossible. Everyone knows what to do.
ZED: I don't know what to do.
ERIC: You don't need to know shit. Just get into the vault and we'll do the rest.
ZED: I haven't even seen the bank.
ERIC: Fuck the bank. Before we do a job we live life. It's better that way. Okay?
ZED: ( unsure ) Good. Now we do heroin!
ERIC: Good. Now we do heroin!
OLIVER: ( so high he's wobbling ) You have to look at the Starship Enterprise as a metaphor for the human
OLIVER: ( continuing ) Spock is the right hemisphere of the brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional. And Kirk is the unseen observer. He drifts between the two. Back and forth, as it might be, caught between the two thought processes.
ERIC: Ricardo hands him a cotton ball.
OLIVER: ( continuing ) It's really quite brilliant you know. That's why Star Trek is and always will be a hit show.
ERIC: ( to Oliver ) [Here, shut up and hold this.]
ERIC: [Don't want to get air bubbles in my
JEAN: Do you want heroin?
ZED: No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.
JEAN: No. A little bit of heroin, some hash, a beer.and you're just right.
CLAUDE: ( recovering from the snort ) That's good.
JEAN: ( recovering from the snort ) That's good.
ERIC: ( to Ricardo in French ) [Hold my arm.] ( then to Zed ) My vein is like a rock.
JEAN: ( to Zed ) Try some. It's called chasing the dragon. The Chinese have been doing it for centuries.
ZED: I don't think so.
JEAN: Oh, but you must. It will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you're rubbing up against it like a bad windshield
ERIC: There. That's Notre Dame.
RICARDO: Do you like French cars?
ZED: ( answering Enrique's question ) I like the Cadillac. Fifty-two to seventy-five. Very nice.
RICARDO: I like the Cadillac. Fifty-two to seventy-five. Very nice.
ERIC: Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.
ZED: Is tomorrow really Bastille day?
ERIC: Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in French history. And spend the rest of our lives in Monte Carlo.
CLAUDE: [Faster, faster.go faster. Let's beat
RICARDO: [Shit! That bastard.]
ERIC: ( to Ricardo ) Watch it! Don't crash my car.
ERIC: Over here is where the male prostitutes sell themselves. Do you see?
OLIVER: ( out the window ) Fucking fags!
ERIC: ( also out the window ) Suce ma bite?!
RICARDO: Perverts d'homosexuels!
ERIC: ( into Zed's ear ) This is good to have you here. We could not do this without you.
ERIC: Everyone has agreed to give you double shares. That's good.
ERIC: You know I have AIDS. From the needle.
ZED: Then Eric sees something.
ERIC: Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe.
ON STAGE: a BAND is playing away. In the audience sit about TWELVE FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.
ZED'S TABLE: Everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club. Oliver sits next to Zed.
OLIVER: So, how long have you known Eric?
ZED: Well, Eric's mother is American.
OLIVER: Yeah, and his dad's French.
ZED: They're divorced. And she and his father had some kind of six month split plan set up. So every six months he would come back to the states. We were best friends. Eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here. It's been.years.
OLIVER: Well, it's good to have you here. Eric speaks fairly highly of you. Say, he says you're a big fan of Viking films.
ZED: Well.I suppose. I used to be, when I was young.
OLIVER: Oh they're the best. Helmets with horns on them. Shit. That's fucking genius.
OLIVER: How 'bout Toy Jazz? You like it?
ZED: Yeah.I guess.
OLIVER: I love it. It's really good, you know? Like real music. It has a heart and culture all it's own. It's, like, jazz for dwarves.or guys in Leiderhosen. Total purity of essence.
ZED: Hungry cannibals'd like it.
OLIVER: Hungry cannibals'd like it.
CLAUDE: Here, you must drink some of this wine, it's good.
OLIVER: ( to Claude ) Non merci, c'est de la merde.
CLAUDE: ( to Oliver ) La ferme. C'est du bon vin. ( to Zed ) The fucking English.
ON STAGE: Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder. The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a delirium of music. The band stands up.
ZED'S TABLE: Suddenly, Zed notices something.
ON STAGE: Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the ZED'S TABLE Zed blinks but it's true. Oliver and Claude start laughing.
ZED'S TABLE: Zed blinks but it's true. Oliver and Claude start laughing.
OLIVER: Look at him. He's crazy.
ON STAGE: And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up with the other musicians and sounding pretty good. Eric is all smile as he plays with them. Sweat is running down his face but he's caught up in the moment. ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like James Brown. Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back to a musician. The set is over. Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver, Claude, and Zed are sitting.
ERIC: I'm glad you came. How long has it been?
ZED: It's amazing, you know? Here you are. One day in America. Now here.
ERIC: It's amazing, you know? Here you are. One day in America. Now here.

CLAUDE: Here, you must drink some of this wine, it's good.
OLIVER: ( to Claude ) Non merci, c'est de la merde.
CLAUDE: ( to Oliver ) La ferme. C'est du bon vin. ( to Zed ) The fucking English.
ON STAGE: Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder. The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a delirium of music. The band stands up.
ZED'S TABLE: Suddenly, Zed notices something.
ON STAGE: Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the ZED'S TABLE Zed blinks but it's true. Oliver and Claude start laughing.
ZED'S TABLE: Zed blinks but it's true. Oliver and Claude start laughing.
OLIVER: Look at him. He's crazy.
ON STAGE: And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up with the other musicians and sounding pretty good. Eric is all smile as he plays with them. Sweat is running down his face but he's caught up in the moment. ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like James Brown. Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back to a musician. The set is over. Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver, Claude, and Zed are sitting.
ERIC: ( to the guard ) [Drop the gun!]
ERIC: [Drop your gun now and nobody dies!] [Good boy.]
ERIC: [Good boy.]
CLAUDE: [I'm going to check things out [Now! On the ground! Face down!]
RICARDO: ( to the people ) [Now! On the ground! Face down!]
CLAUDE: [All clear down here?]
ERIC: [Take these two upstairs. And chain the gate to the sub lobby shut.]
CLAUDE: [The phones and video are down! We're locked up tight!] We fucking did it!
ERIC: [Any others I should worry about?]
BANK MANAGER: ( to Oliver ) [Well, just to be sure] [Freeze motherfucker!]
ERIC: ( to Oliver ) [Well, just to be sure] [Freeze motherfucker!]
OLIVER: [Freeze motherfucker!]
ERIC: [Who the fuck are you?]
STODGY CUSTOMER: [Please don't shoot me!]
OLIVER: [On the ground!]
ERIC: ( to the bank manager ) [Making a deposit I hope.] ( he smiles to Oliver ) [Bring him with us.]
BANK MANAGER: ( to the sub lobby teller ) [Vault locked?]
ERIC: [Shut your fucking mouths!]
BANK MANAGER: ( to Eric ) [The vault doors are shut and time locked. You won't be able to open them.]
ERIC: ( to the bank manager ) [You think we're fucking amateurs? You think we're stupid? I've got news for you.we planned ahead my friend!]
ERIC: [Now save us a lot of time and just open the vault.]
BANK MANAGER: He releases the bank manager and stuffs the barrel of his handgun into the sub level tellers mouth.
ERIC: He releases the bank manager and stuffs the barrel of his handgun into the sub level tellers mouth.
ERIC: [Open the vault.]
BANK MANAGER: [I cannot.]
ERIC: ( to the teller ) [Can you?]
BANK MANAGER: [No. Once closed only I can open it.]
ERIC: [Then open it.]
BANK MANAGER: [I cannot.]
ERIC: [Do you understand that I'll kill her if you don't open this fucking vault?]
BANK MANAGER: [Do you understand that this is an international reserve bank? Robbing it is punishable by life imprisonment.]
ZED: Jesus fucking Christ! [Open the vault door or I'll kill this man next.] [I still cannot open the vault.]
ERIC: [Open the vault door or I'll kill this man next.] [I still cannot open the vault.]
BANK MANAGER: [I still cannot open the vault.]
ERIC: [Come on. It's only things in there. This man is flesh and blood.]
BANK MANAGER: [I will not open the vault.]
ZED: Eric no! I can open the vault!
ERIC: Shut the fuck up! [You're a customer in this bank and this is how they treat you. Do you have a
ERIC: [Would you like to see them again?]
ERIC: ( to the manager ) [This man has a family he would like to have Bastille day dinner with tonight. So save us some time and open the vault.]
BANK MANAGER: Eric quickly removes the gun from the customers temple and fires two shots into the bank manager's face. The bank manager falls against the vault door and onto the He starts nodding his head.
ERIC: Fucking idiot. [You seem like a nice man. Tonight at dinner think about how lucky you are and how much you love your family.]
STODGY CUSTOMER: ( to Oliver ) [Take him upstairs.]
ERIC: ( to Oliver ) [Take him upstairs.]
ERIC: Don't you ever conflict with me during work again! Do you hear!?
ZED: You didn't have to shoot any of them!
ERIC: ( patronizing ) Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were in charge now. Nobody told me. ( his temper flares ) If he had opened the vault it would have saved us a fucking hour.
ZED: Eric. It's just that we've gone from being thieves to murderers.
ERIC: Oh fuck it doesn't matter! Here you get the death penalty just for robbing a federal bank.
ZED: I thought the death penalty was abolished in 1980?
ERIC: Ohhhh! That's what they tell you! But who cares? I need to take a piss.
ERIC: ( on his way into the bathroom ) Why don't you open the vault?
FRANCOIS: [Looks clear.]
JEAN: [What do you mean you're not sure if the alarm went off or not?]
RICARDO: [I mean I'm not sure.]
JEAN: [Well, either it did or it didn't.]
RICARDO: [And I'm not sure.]
JEAN: [Well, do you think it did?]
RICARDO: [I just fucking told you, I don't know.]
JEAN: [Take a guess.]
RICARDO: [It didn't.]
JEAN: [You're sure?]
RICARDO: [No. It's just a guess.]
JEAN: [Well what kind of a fucking guess is that? You're saying it could have.]
RICARDO: [Well that's fucking great. Why didn't you just kill that asshole to begin with. I knew I should have been the one to kill him. You're always so damn slow.]
JEAN: [Well that's fucking great. Why didn't you just kill that asshole to begin with. I knew I should have been the one to kill him. You're always so damn slow.]
RICARDO: [Shit these masks are really hot.]
CLAUDE: [I know, I've got fucking sweat stinging my eyes.]
JEAN: ( in French to Ricardo ) [Do you know one?]
RICARDO: [Let's see. Okay. An unfortunate fellow was locked up in prison doing five to ten for armed robbery. All he could think of the whole time was eating pussy.]
RICARDO: [The day finally came for his release. He walked out of the prison with a new suit and fifty francs the officials had given him, and made a bee-line for the whorehouse in the nearest town. Slamming his fifty francs on the front desk, he said, "I wanna eat some pussy."]
RICARDO: [I'm not done. Listen. "Where've you been," said the greasy fellow behind the desk, "fifty francs won't get you a close look these days."]
RICARDO: ["Listen buddy," said the ex-convict, pulling him out of his chair by the shirt collar, "I wanna eat some pussy, and I want it now!"]
RICARDO: ["Okay, okay," gasped the proprietor, "I'll see what I can do." So the ex-con followed him through to the very back of the warehouse through some stained, tattered red curtains, and into a grimy little room where a bedraggled looking whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed. "She's yours for fifty francs," said the proprietor, and the fellow went at it.]
RICARDO: [After a little while, he came across a piece of egg. "That's funny," he thought to himself, "I don't think I had egg for breakfast." But he spat it out and kept eating away. Next he found a piece of chipped beef wedged between his front teeth. "I'm sure I haven't eaten chipped beef this week," he thought, but kept on. Then he came across the corn. "What is this?" he said, "I think I'm going to be
RICARDO: ["Ya know," says the whore, "that's what the last guy said."] [No one fucking moves!]
CLAUDE: [No one fucking moves!]
JEAN: [Shit! What happened!?]
ERIC: What is it? What's going on?
ZED: I don't know.
ERIC: No! You stay here.
JEAN: [Nobody fucking moves! Nobody fucking
CLAUDE: [The gun! Somebody get it!]
OLIVER: [Don't fuck with me! Don't fuck with
ERIC: [What the fuck is going on!?]
OLIVER: ( pointing at the dead man ) [This crazy fuck shot Ricardo!]
JEAN: ( quietly ) [Eric, your mask.]
ERIC: Oh shit.
OLIVER: Who gives a damn if they see us or not anyway! I can't see a fucking think in
ERIC: [Is this what happens? Is this what happens when I walk away for five [He had a hidden gun.]
CLAUDE: [He had a hidden gun.]
ERIC: ( mimicking a little child ) [He had a hidden gun.] ( then back to normal ) [I don't care!]
MALE TOURIST: ( holding up his passport ) This is insane! I am a U.S. citizen! You must let me go!
MALE TOURIST: I'm an American! American! I'm just here exchanging dollars. If it wasn't for my country you'd all be speaking
ERIC: ( to the people ) [I have had enough of this nonsense! The next person that speaks will die!]
JEAN: [Eric, I'm sorry. Things got out of hand. But we're in control now.]
ERIC: [Good. Let's try to keep it that way. God what a mess.]
CLAUDE: [What the fuck is it now!? You want me to hold your hand as you take a piss?]
ERIC: [What the fuck is it now!? You want me to hold your hand as you take a piss?]
CLAUDE: [I have a question.]
ERIC: [Do we know if the alarm went off or [We do?]
CLAUDE: [Do we know if the alarm went off or [We do?]
ERIC: [We do?]
CLAUDE: [We do?]
ERIC: [Yes. It didn't go off. If it had the police would be here and our whole plan would be fucked. But they're not here, and our plan isn't fucked. So if there aren't any more fucking stupid questions I'll go downstairs and see if we're in yet. Is that okay with you?]
ERIC: [I thought the phones were dead.]
OLIVER: The phones are dead.
ERIC: [Answer it!]
ERIC: [Answer it or you will die.]
WOMAN TELLER: ( answering phone through tears ) Banque Internationale de Paris.
WOMAN TELLER: [It's for you.]
ERIC: ( into phone ) ( pause ) [Who is this?]
OLIVER: Oh my God! The police!
ERIC: ( into phone ) [What do you want?]
ERIC: ( into phone ) [We're all fine in here.]
ERIC: ( into phone ) [No. I'll tell you what, you go fuck yourself you fucking pig. You send anyone near this building and I'll kill the first person I lay my hands on. I've got plenty hostages here to kill so don't even think of coming in.] ( pause ) [Just stay put. We'll call you when we're ready. In the mean time, have a nice day.]
CLAUDE: [The silent alarm must have gone off after all!]
ERIC: [Shut the fuck up! The alarm didn't do shit. For all we know your idiot shooting brought them here. Anyhow it doesn't matter. Nothing has changed.]
JEAN: [My God! The police! What are we going to do?]
ERIC: [Nothing. We don't have to do anything. The plan stays the same, just slightly
ERIC: [If the police decide to come in.kill them. And if you don't mind, stack those bodies somewhere else. This place is a fucking mess and it's bad for morale.]
ZED: ( turning to Eric ) What's going on?
ERIC: Nothing. They were just scaring them.
ZED: Well, did you tell them to stay quiet?
ERIC: Yes. They're assholes. Just having fun.
ZED: Fucked up my drill bit.
ERIC: It's okay. You can buy another one.
ZED: Cross your fingers.
ZED: Excellent. What next?
ERIC: Excellent. What next?
ZED: We find the fuse box. It'll probably be
ERIC: It's okay. I'll find it for you.
ZED: No. I need to see it myself.
ERIC: I think it would be better if I looked for you. I could
ZED: Hold on. Here she is.
ZED: Let's see.
ZED: Okay, you throw this fuse switch off and then back on when I call to you. Any other switch may set off the alarm.
ERIC: Oh, I wouldn't want to do that.
ZED: ( serious ) Got it?
ERIC: ( nodding ) Got it.
ZED: Come on sweetie don't fail me now.
ZED: ( calling to Eric ) ( calling back )
ZED: The lights go out and then back on. There is a whirring sound from the vault door. The LED's quickly go from red to green. There is a loud, heavy clicking as the vault door unlocks.
ZED: Open seasame.
ERIC: It worked!
ERIC: Oh my God it worked!
ZED: I can get through that lock in a minute.
ERIC: Then do it. We don't have all day.
ZED: Dime store brand. Three minutes max.
ERIC: Then, there's a gunshot. The bullet comes from the Calibre vault through the window and almost hits Zed. Zed falls backwards onto the floor.
ZED: Then there's another gunshot. The bullet ricochets through the vault.
ERIC: Then there's another gunshot. The bullet ricochets through the vault.
ZED: Jesus Christ!
ZED: Another security guard?
ERIC: Must be.
ZED: I think I stained my pants.
ERIC: Me too.
OLIVER: What is it?! I came down to see how things were going and heard shots!
ERIC: Some asshole in the vault.
OLIVER: We've got guns. Why don't we just storm in and blast his fucking ass! It's three against one! Let's give it the old
ERIC: I'm just trying to be helpful.
OLIVER: I'm just trying to be helpful.
ERIC: Just let me think.
OLIVER: You don't have to snap at me.
ERIC: ( calling into the vault ) [Hey you. Nice shooting. Play time's over. Why don't you throw out your gun?]
ERIC: [Come on. We don't want to kill you.]
ERIC: ( quietly to Zed ) What is this guys problem? ( then to the guard ) [Come on! You're making me impatient. I don't have all day.]
ERIC: [Then take a paid vacation. We won't tell if you won't.]
ZED: ( quietly ) What the Hell are you doing? Have you gone mad?
ERIC: [Well, look, we're going to give you fifteen minutes to change your mind. That's too much. It's dangerous.
ZED: ( holding his voice down ) That's too much. It's dangerous.
ERIC: I like danger. [Changed your mind yet?]
FRANCOIS: [Should we see if they're okay?]
JEAN: [No. They're just blasting the vault [What does it matter now? We're fucking surrounded by police.]
CLAUDE: [What does it matter now? We're fucking surrounded by police.]
ZED: You asshole! You could have killed us But I didn't! Let's go check out the
ERIC: But I didn't! Let's go check out the
ERIC: Zed look! I beat you! I opened it in under three
ERIC: I beat you! I opened it in under three
ZED: ( to Oliver ) Go around and wait at the main vault door. When I tell you, open it up.
OLIVER: Right. When you tell me, I'll open it
ZED: Zed crawls through the opening.
OLIVER: Zed crawls through the opening.
OLIVER: I'll be at the other vault waiting for you to call to me.
ERIC: Look at it! We're all rich!
ERIC: We're rich!
ERIC: We're rich!
ZED: We're not out of here yet.
ERIC: Yes but we're rich!
ERIC: I'm going to show the others.
CLAUDE: [What? You think we may actually get out of this? You're fooling yourself.]
JEAN: [Why are you such a pessimist?]
CLAUDE: [Are you kidding me? Look at this mess.]
CLAUDE: [This is nothing. Imagine the police outside. We're dead men.]
ERIC: [Jean, Francois, Claude.look at this.]
JEAN: [You did it! You got in!]
ERIC: [Zed is opening the vault now. This is a
ERIC: [Look at this and tell me I'm not [You're a monster! And you'll never leave this place alive!]
WOMAN CUSTOMER: ( crying ) [You're a monster! And you'll never leave this place alive!]
ERIC: ( to the hostages ) [None of you are worth half of this single bar. Remember that.]
CLAUDE: [Eric.can I speak with you?]
ERIC: [Of course.]
CLAUDE: [In private.]
ERIC: [There's no need. I have nothing to hide. What is it Claude?]
CLAUDE: [Well.we're surrounded by the police and we have no way out. What are we going to do?]
ERIC: [What are you doing Claude? Talking of all this false doubt. What do you think we're going to do?]
CLAUDE: [I don't know.not the original plan.]
ERIC: [Obviously, since Ricardo fucked us up and didn't kill the concierge fast enough. And killing all these assholes
CLAUDE: [No. Because we'll need them as hostages when we get on the plane.]
ERIC: [No. Because we'll need them as hostages when we get on the plane.]
CLAUDE: [We're going on a plane?]
ERIC: [Claude, you are a mental giant. Leave the plans up to me and just kill people if they get out of line, okay?]
CLAUDE: Eric turns and starts to walk toward the downstairs.
ERIC: [I'm going to see how things are going.]
ERIC: [They want to fuck with me!? They want to fuck with me!?]
ERIC: [You want to fuck with me!? I'll show you what happens to people who fuck with
ERIC: [The moment of truth my love. You knew it would come.]
ZOEY: ( screeching )
ASSISTANT MANAGER: [No! What ever it is you're going to do have mercy!]
ERIC: [Have mercy?]
ASSISTANT MANAGER: [With her.]
ERIC: [With her.]
ASSISTANT MANAGER: [That's sweet.] [You have quite a reach my lovely. Is he one of your clients?]
ERIC: [That's sweet.] [You have quite a reach my lovely. Is he one of your clients?]
ERIC: [It's a deal.]
ASSISTANT MANAGER: [Thank you.]
ERIC: [Don't mention it.]
CLAUDE: [Eric! What are you doing?]
ERIC: [Clearing up the "how full of shit am I" question the cops are asking themselves right now.]
ERIC: ( into phone ) ( pause ) [Yes. I'll hold.] ( then to Claude ) [I'm holding.]
ERIC: ( into phone ) ( pause ) [You don't know the fucking half of it. So just shut the fuck up and listen. Try any more stunts and I'll fucking really go crazy.] ( pause ) [Well that's good because if you faggot cops even think of it I'll kill some more people. Hear?] ( pause ) [No. None of that. We won't trade. That never works. Not in the movies, not in real life. Understand? We're going to get into our van, with a couple of people, go to the airport, and fly out of this shit hole city. And you're not going to follow us.] ( pause ) [Who do you fucking think is going to supply the plane? Us? No, you fucking imbecile, the French taxpayers would be a good second guess for you. You're really pissing me off. You think I'm a fucking
ERIC: ( to Claude ) [I fucking hate cops.]
ZED: Are you still there?
ZED: Open seasame.
ZED: Do you want to give me a hand?
OLIVER: Oliver puts his gun down and they go into the Calibre vault.
OLIVER: Holy mother.
ZED: Here, help me with this.
ERIC: He grabs his machine gun and aims it at the sub lobby guard
ERIC: [That's what you get!]
CLAUDE: Eric looks at him.
ERIC: [The fucking police won't budge. I kill a man and they don't care. They say they don't make deals with terrorists. It really fucks up my plan.]
CLAUDE: [And what if we gave up?]
ERIC: ( laughing ) [Claude, look around you. We're not talking prison here. You know. The cops will give in. You start killing women.they give in. They're all so fucking much in love with women!]
ERIC: [What are you looking at you fucking
ERIC: [Are you afraid I'll tell these people that this is only a day job for you?]
ERIC: [What? So they know that you're a]
ERIC: [Shut up!]
ERIC: [My only mistake was not to make an example of a woman to begin with.]
OLIVER: This is unbelievable. Look at all of this. It's wonderful to touch.
ZED: Just help me steer this out.
OLIVER: Do you think we should get some cash What for?
ZED: What for?
OLIVER: Well, you never know.
ZED: Money is too easily traceable. You'd never be able to spend it. And forget about exchanging it.
OLIVER: That's true.
ZED: No sir. Your best bet is to get these bars melted down in Tunisia or Korea.
OLIVER: Eric knows someone in Portugal.
ZED: Or Portugal.
ERIC: ( groaning ) [You fucking bitch!]
ERIC: CUT TO:
ZED: Do we have a covering of some kind?
OLIVER: A what?
ZED: You know. Something to cover this with. It'll look kind of conspicuous leaving the bank with a platten of gold.
OLIVER: Oh, it won't matter. The police know what we're up too.
ZED: Police?! What do you mean they know what we're up too?
OLIVER: You don't know? We've been discovered. But Eric has them under control.
ZED: No I didn't know! How many police?
OLIVER: The building is surrounded.
ERIC: Kill her! Kill her!
ERIC: What the fuck are you doing!?
CLAUDE: [They're trying to smoke us out Eric!]
FRANCOIS: [What do we do!?]
ERIC: Do you really love your bitch whore girlfriend that much? She's really fucked with your mind.
ZED: Eric.what are you talking about? Look at it. It's all for us. The smoke. The attention. They have no idea of who they're dealing with. They have no idea what kind of men we are.
ERIC: Look at it. It's all for us. The smoke. The attention. They have no idea of who they're dealing with. They have no idea what kind of men we are.
ZED: ( thinking Eric is a madman ) What kind of men are we?
ERIC: You can no longer be in our club. You forfeit your cut of the pie.
ZED: What about our friendship?
ERIC: Shit Zed. I haven't seen you in years. You hardly know me.
ERIC: Never let a girl come between two men.
ERIC: Now let's try to get out of here. [The police! They're entering the
FRANCOIS: [The police! They're entering the
ERIC: ( to himself ) [Smoother and more giving than the most selfless human being. You're beautiful.]
FRANCOIS: [Jesus, what now?]
ERIC: [Jesus, what now?]
FRANCOIS: [The police are coming in! We're [Get a hostage.]
ERIC: [Get a hostage.]
FRANCOIS: ( frantic ) [They don't give a fuck about the [Don't make me!]
JEAN: [Don't make me!]
ZED: ( almost delerious ) ( holding him ) My Zed. They've hurt you.
ZOE: ( holding him ) My Zed. They've hurt you.
ZOE: ( trying to comfort him ) You're going to be okay. In many countries scars on the face are a symbol of heroism. To proudly display a flaw like a badge.is to wear a badge of
ZED: Be serious Zoe.I can stick my tongue through my cheek.
FRANCOIS: Oliver! Let's get a hostage!
OLIVER: This is the end!
ZOE: Listen to me. We're going to lock ourselves into one of the air tight vaults.if any of them are still open.
OLIVER: Oliver turns to where the police will surely be coming in.
ZOE: Merde! The vault has been closed.
ZED: What about the others?
ZOE: Listen.there's no gunfire.
OLIVER: ( to police )
OLIVER: You wanna fuck with me? You wanna fuck with me? I'll show you who you're fucking with!
ZOEY: C'mon, we'll be safer in here.
ERIC: Then, Zed and Zoey appear from the hall to the reserve vault Eric turns to them with his gun raised, when he sees them he lowers it.
ERIC: They all stand there for a moment, the gunfire cracking away upstairs. Eric is more casual than he should be.
ERIC: ( matter-of-factly ) What's your girlfriends name?
ZED: ( to Zoey in French ) [Zoe, come here to me.]
ERIC: ( to Zoey in French ) [Zoe, come here to me.]
ERIC: [Killing you would just be gravy, so don't fuck with me.]
ZOEY: [Go ahead you slob. Shave my ass!]
ERIC: Zed no. I'll kill you. It means nothing to me, our friendship.
ZED: ( starting out calm and then Eric.there's no fucking way out of Oh but you're wrong. This is my way out. This dime store couge with her motor driven ass. You find your own.
ERIC: Oh but you're wrong. This is my way out. This dime store couge with her motor driven ass. You find your own.
ERIC: Come Zed.I'm going to cut you like a
ZED: Zoey, get out of here!
ERIC: Did you see how she ran? Did you see how she ran? She doesn't care about you. Fucking pussy only cares about pussy. Look out for number one. What do you say
ERIC: I will kill you. And once I kill you Zed, I'll get out of here. I'll fuck your bitch up the ass and give her AIDS.if she doesn't already have it. What do you say to that Zed?
ERIC: Fucking bitch!
OLIVER: Ox! Where is thy yoke!?
ERIC: Fuck both of you.
ERIC: Au revoir.
ZOEY: Then, all of the French policemen, decked out in their assault gear and wearing gas masks, storm down the stairs. At the sight of Eric about to execute Zed they raise their Eric stops. It becomes quiet. Then, Eric looks back down at Zed and braces for the shotgun He squeezes the trigger and.
ERIC: I give you little kiss. Ciao.
CLICK: The police open fire with their French made assault machine guns and fill Eric with bullets. Instead of falling he does a scarecrow dance as his body is painted red. The wall behind them explodes as plaster sprays all over Zed. An IMAGE overcomes Eric. Eric's dead body slumps to it's knees and flops on top of Zed pushes the body off and tries to drag himself to Zoey. Zoey runs up to him and holds him. The police all charge into the secondary vault area and secure the downstairs. Zoey is crying as she holds Zed. The police have their guns aimed at the two of them. Zoey looks up.
ZOEY: ( to the policemen ) [I work here. This man is a customer.he needs medical help.]
I.D.]: No longer interested in Zoey or Zed, he goes to check out the
ZOEY: The hospital?
ZED: Come on. I have a car.
ZOEY: Come on. I have a car.
ZED: I'm so tired.
ZOEY: We'll go to my flat. You can rest there. Do you feel pain?
ZED: No.it was mostly his blood.
ZOEY: I have a shower. You can clean up there.
ZED: Thank you Zoe.
ZOEY: My name is not Zoe. Not any more.
ZOEY: You'll get well. Then I'll show you the real Paris.
