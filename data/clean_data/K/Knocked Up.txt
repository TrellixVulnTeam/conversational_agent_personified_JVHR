JASON: Just watch your back, Serpico. You never know who your friends are.
MARTIN: You guy can't make fun of the me the whole time.
JASON: But, Martin, it's a competition. It's called "The Dirty Man Competition." We're gonna make fun of you until you shave the beard. That's the rules.

MARTIN: You guys aren't allowed to make fun of me. It's not part of the rules.
JASON: Martin, why didn't you just listen to me when I was explaining the rules? You just looked at me with that blank stare of yours. It was like talking to a wax statue.

No one has the balls to sit them down and say, "Look, just cut the shit."But everybody works for `em. They're all on the payroll. They're all sucking the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to- eye, one-on-one, and says. "Cut the shit." And all these stars just to fuck it up. That's what they do. They fuck my day up! And it pisses me off! And now I'm sweating.

JONAH: I can't believe you did this. You fucked everything up.
JASON: Look, the real point is not to get yourself in this position. That's what you have to realize. You gotta know all the tricks. Like, for example, if a woman's on top, she can't get pregnant. It's just gravity.
JONAH: Everyone knows that.
JASON: What goes up must come down.
JAY: I think it's awesome that you're gonna have a kid, man. Think of it like this. It's just an excuse to play with all your old toys again.

BEN: I had a vision for how my life would go and this definitely is not it.
HARRIS: Wait. Are you living your vision right I am kinda living my vision, yeah.
BEN: I am kinda living my vision, yeah.
HARRIS: Well, that is sad, I'm telling you. Life doesn't care about your vision. Stuff happens. You just got to deal with it. Roll with it. That's the beauty of it all.
BEN: Stuff happens. You just got to deal with it. Roll with it. That's the beauty of it all.
HARRIS: Stuff happens. You just got to deal with it. Roll with it. That's the beauty of it all.
BEN: I just don't get how I tell the kid not to do drugs when I do drugs. I'll feel like a hypocrite.
HARRIS: Well you remember what I told you? When you were a teenager?
BEN: What did you say?
HARRIS: I said, "No pill, no powders."
BEN: That's right, that's right.
HARRIS: Right. If it grows in the ground, it's probably okay.
BEN: I guess it worked. You told me not to smoke pot all those years. And then I found out you were smoking pot that whole time.
HARRIS: Not the whole time. Just in the evenings and all day every weekend. Not that much.
BEN: Honestly, though, when you look at me, do you not think at all, like, you know, if he just never existed, I would have avoided a massive heap of trouble? You know?
HARRIS: Absolutely not. I love you totally and completely. You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
BEN: I'm the best thing that ever happened to you?

ALISON: Yeah, yeah, it is good.
BEN: I know we didn't plan this and neither of us really thought it was gonna happen but life is like that, you know? You can't plan for it and even if we did, life doesn't care about your plans, necessarily, and you just kinda have to go with the flow and I just know my job is to just support you in whatever it is you wanna do. I'm in, so whatever you wanna do, I'm gonna do. Alison WEEPS softly into the phone.
ALISON: I really appreciate you saying that.
BEN: No problem. I'll tell you, maybe if you could help me by telling me, like one thing that I am supposed to do, then that would be good, `cause I literally have no idea whatsoever.
ALISON: I have no idea either.

SADIE: I never met him before.
ALISON: He's a new boyfriend.
BEN: But a boyfriend.
SADIE: So he came over for breakfast because he's your new boyfriend?
DEBBIE: He came from his house, drove over to our house because he thought it would be fun to have breakfast with us, so he drove his car from his house to our house to have breakfast.
PETE: Because he likes breakfast so much.
CHARLOTTE: I love breakfast.
BEN: You guys wanna hear something neat? We're gonna have a baby together.
SADIE: Yeah, a baby.
BEN: Yeah, a baby.
SADIE: Well, you're not married. Aren't you supposed to be married to have a baby?
PETE: You don't have to be.
DEBBIE: But they should be because they love each other and people who love each other get married and have babies.
SADIE: Where do babies come from?
DEBBIE: Where do you think they come from?
SADIE: Well, I think a stork, he drops it down, and then, a hole goes in your body and there's blood everywhere, coming out of your head, and then you push your belly-button, and then your butt falls off and then you hold you butt and you have to dig and you find a little baby.
DEBBIE: That's exactly right.

PETE: What am I doing?
DEBBIE: Because I want to rip your fucking head off because you're so fucking stupid! This is scary.
PETE: I literally am at a point where I don't know what I can say.
DEBBIE: So I'm the bad guy because I'm trying to protect our kids from child molesters and mercury? And you're cool because you don't give a shit?

ALISON: ( TO DEBBIE )
DEBBIE: No. You need your own crib.
BEN: There's one of these in an alley behind my house. We could just grab that. Just rub Purell all over it.
DEBBIE: You know what? Let me buy it. I need to get you a baby present anyway, and I would love to get it for you.
ALISON: I'm serious. I want to.

BEN: It's a really funny story, actually, if you guys, if you got a second to hear it.
ALISON: It's not really funny.
GIRL #1: Tell us.
ALISON: It's not funny.
BEN: Let them be the judge, okay? I think it's funny.
ALISON: All right.
BEN: You know they say don't drink and Don't drink and bone!
GUY #1: Don't drink and bone!
BEN: Don't drink and bone!
GIRL #2: EXT. RECORD STORE - DAY Establishing shot.
BEN: Yeah, she was acting weird and I really think it's just because I haven't made an honest woman out of her. She's carrying my bastard child. No one wants that.
PETE: That's what I did. I married Debbie when she got pregnant.
BEN: You think she's, like, hiding me? Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me or something like that?
PETE: Probably. I'd hide you.
BEN: How much do wedding rings cost?
PETE: It really depends, you know? I think you're supposed to spend three months pay on a ring.
BEN: That'll be easy. I don't make any Really? I thought there was a lot of money in porn.
PETE: Really? I thought there was a lot of money in porn.
BEN: God, it's not porn? All we do is we show you what nude scenes are in what Like Mister Skin?
PETE: Like Mister Skin?
BEN: Who's Mister Skin?
PETE: Dude, Mister Skin. Pete imitates the Mister Skin logo smile.
JONAH: We've wasted fourteen months of our This is exactly the same as our site. How the fuck did this happen?
BEN: This is exactly the same as our site. How the fuck did this happen?
JONAH: Mister Skin! That's even a better name than ours!
MARTIN: Well, fuck me in the beard.
JASON: Dude, they got the top ten group shower scenes! Why didn't you think of that, Jay!
JAY: Don't put this on me!
BEN: God damn it!
MARTIN: Well shit. I saw it online at one point, but I guess I didn't connect the dots.
JONAH: What are we gonna do now?
BEN: All we need to do is think of a new, better idea that no one else has thought of already.
JASON: "Spiderman Three" starts in eight KNOCKED UP - 72. Shit. Don't worry. We'll figure it Jonah, Jason and Martin exit. Ben and Jay sit at the desk.
JONAH: Shit. Don't worry. We'll figure it Jonah, Jason and Martin exit. Ben and Jay sit at the desk.
BEN: You know what? Just because this site exists doesn't mean ours won't work. Good things come in pairs.
JAY: For sure.
BEN: "Volcano," "Dante's Peak." "Deep Impact," "Armageddon." "Wyatt Earp," Panda Express, Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.
JAY: Panda Express, Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.
BEN: Exactly. We can work together. This helps us, if anything.
JAY: We're golden.
BEN: Alison, I'm sure this isn't how you pictured it being exactly and it's not how I wanted it. That is why I'm presenting you with this empty box. It's a promise, Alison. A promise that one day I will fill this with a ring that you deserve, a beautiful ring. I can't afford it yet. I've picked it out, though. It's at De Beers and it's really nice. So, basically, I'm asking you, will you marry me? Because I'm in love with you.
ALISON: I love you too.
BEN: Really? That's so nice to hear. That's the first time a girl's ever said that to me.
ALISON: But here's the thing.
BEN: There's a thing?
ALISON: I don't really know yet what that love means. It's so new and it's so exciting. It's great. I don't know. We've only known each other for seventeen weeks.
BEN: Look, I thought you felt weird that we're having a baby and we're not engaged. I'm going to get off my knee. It hurts. Ben sits next to Alison on the bed.
ALISON: I'm okay with that. We're just doing what we can. I don't want us to put any more pressure on ourselves than we That makes sense.
BEN: That makes sense.
ALISON: I didn't hurt your feelings, did I?
BEN: No. I just wanted to do right by you. If you don't want to, that's totally I really do love you.
ALISON: I really do love you.
BEN: I know. Thanks. You mentioned that. It's nice.
ALISON: Ben proposed to me. He did. It was really sweet. I feel a little bad. He was wearing this great button-down. He tucked it in. He got down on one knee. He didn't have an actual ring, though, just an empty box but he had this whole spiel about when he has the money, he'll buy me the ring I The box was empty?
DEBBIE: The box was empty?
ALISON: He can't afford a ring.
DEBBIE: So he got down on one knee and gave you an empty box?
ALISON: I'm sorry.
DEBBIE: I'm sorry.
ALISON: Get over it. If you'd been there, you would have cried.
DEBBIE: You need to train him. Oprah said that when two people meet they should point out each other's differences and I thought you should love people for who they are.
ALISON: I thought you should love people for who they are.
DEBBIE: You criticize them a lot, so they get so down on themselves they have to You don't think that's naggy?
ALISON: You don't think that's naggy?
DEBBIE: In the end, they thank you for it.
DEBBIE: You can't commit to him. You don't even know him. I don't even know Pete after ten years. I don't know what he's up to. He's miserable.
ALISON: Why do you say that?
DEBBIE: I think he's cheating on me. He's always going to business meetings at odd hours. Then I try to call him on his cell phone and he says he's in bad cell phone reception areas when he's in good reception areas.
ALISON: Maybe he's working late. Maybe he's trying to sign a new band. I can't imagine Pete doing that.
DEBBIE: There's no part of you that thinks maybe he's a dirty little scumbag?
ALISON: I think he might be.
DEBBIE: I think he might be.
DEBBIE: "Memory Spy Web Memory Software. Locate history, files, websites visited, hidden downloads, e-mail history. Memory Spy." Let's see you hide from me now, little man. Alison is disturbed by this whole ordeal.
PETE: You're not going to tell them?
ALISON: No. I don't have to. It's illegal for them to fire me over it. And I get three months maternity leave if I stay. So I'm not going to tell them.
DEBBIE: Good plan.
PETE: I like it.
BEN: It's a good plan until her water breaks over Robert De Niro's shoes. ( impersonating Robert De
NIRO ): My shoes. There's baby goo on them.
PETE: ( impersonating Robert De
NIRO ): These shoes? On these shoes? Did you puke on my shoes?
BEN: ( impersonating Robert De
NIRO ): Is your water on my shoes?
PETE: ( back as Pete ) Isn't it weird, though, when you have a kid and all your dreams and hopes go right out the window.
DEBBIE: What changed for you? What went out the window? You do everything exactly the same.
PETE: No, I love what I'm doing. But say before you're married with children you want to live in India for a year. You can do it.
DEBBIE: You want to go to India? Go to India! Do you want to go to India?
PETE: Do you want to go to India?
DEBBIE: No. You can go.
BEN: I get what he means. Honestly, when I found out about. Ben motions towards Alison.
ALISON: What do you mean?
BEN: Don't look at me. We can talk about our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched up to you in the DeLorean and said, "Alison, I got the car here. What do you want to do?" No part of you would think, "Maybe I'll go back to that night and put a condom on Ben's dick?" You never got that flash?
ALISON: No. What are you talking about?
PETE: "Where we're going, we don't need KNOCKED UP - 77. You wouldn't do that?
BEN: You wouldn't do that?
ALISON: I don't know who Doc Brown is. What are you talking about?
BEN: Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He invented the DeLorean time machine.
PETE: Everyone has a time machine image.
DEBBIE: I have a really good idea. Why don't you two get in your time machine, go back in time and fuck each other?
PETE: Who needs a time machine? Ben holds up his drink.
BEN: This is my time machine!
PETE: ( TO BEN )
BEN: ( TO PETE )
PETE: ( TO BEN )
BEN: This is fun! We should do this more. This is the most fun I've had in a really long time.
ALISON: Come on, harder.
BEN: I can't.
ALISON: Why? Just do it deeper.
BEN: I can't.
ALISON: I'll poke the baby if I go deeper.
BEN: I'll poke the baby if I go deeper.
ALISON: Just do it!
BEN: Please don't yell at me.
ALISON: The doctor and Debbie said it's fine. Come on! Ben stops.
BEN: I'm sorry, can we change positions? I'm going to crush the baby.
ALISON: That's ridiculous!
BEN: No, it's not. It has no shell.
ALISON: Millions of people have sex when they're pregnant! It just works!
BEN: I weigh over 200 pounds.
ALISON: Just get over it.
BEN: I can't do it. Can you just get on top? All I can see if our baby, poked in the face by my penis.
ALISON: Trust me, you're not even close. Okay, Alison moves on top. Alison abruptly stops.
BEN: You look beautiful. Your chin looks so KNOCKED UP - 79. And my boobs are all like, squishy and they're flopping around. I can feel it and it's distracting. It's all National Geographic.
ALISON: And my boobs are all like, squishy and they're flopping around. I can feel it and it's distracting. It's all National Geographic.
BEN: ( WHISPERING )
ALISON: No. I do not want you to fuck me like a dog.
BEN: I'm not fucking you like a dog. It's doggie style. It's just the style. I'm, it's not like a dog. We don't have to go outside or anything. Ben and Alison lie down side by side, Ben is behind.
ALISON: Should I go slower?
BEN: Should I go slower?
ALISON: Just tell me when you're close.
BEN: Just tell me when you're close.
ALISON: Just go harder.
BEN: Keep going! Ben recoils.
ALISON: Keep going! Ben recoils.
BEN: Oh, God. Oh, fuck!
ALISON: What happened?
BEN: The baby. It kicked my hand.
ALISON: It always kicks.
BEN: No, no, no, no, no.
ALISON: It's fine.
BEN: Not like this. No, this was a warning Just keep going.
ALISON: Just keep going.
BEN: This was a bad kick.
ALISON: It's fine! It's fine!
BEN: Look. My dick must be like an inch away from its face and it's coming, just coming in at its face. What if it kicked because it didn't like it? I can't do that to our baby. That's the first thing it's going to see.
ALISON: What are you talking about?
BEN: It's having the baby between us, it just makes it weird. I'm sorry. It just freaks me out a bit. It's a little weird.
ALISON: I have totally lost it now.
BEN: You've totally lost it?
ALISON: I've lost it.
BEN: Great, you know what? Just forget it. Alison turns her back to Ben and gets settled to sleep.
ALISON: Great, you know what? Just forget it. Alison turns her back to Ben and gets settled to sleep.
BEN: INT. BEN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Ben smokes his bong. Suddenly, there is an earthquake.
ALISON: INT. BEN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Ben stands up and tries to steady himself.
BEN: Fuck me. Jay runs through the room towards the front door.
JAY: Oh my God! It's the Russians. Martin carries Jodi out.
MARTIN: Jodi! I'll protect you! Ben clutches his bong and runs to the door. Alison runs to the door as well.
ALISON: Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, no!
BEN: Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, no!
JAY: That was horrible! That was so You're fine, man.
JASON: You're fine, man.
JAY: When will it be light out?
JASON: Take it easy.
JAY: When will it be light out?
JASON: Did anybody turn off the gas?
MARTIN: I didn't do it.
JASON: Oh, motherfucker. Jason runs back to the house.
JONAH: Martin, this is my friend, Alex. She's a pretty incredible person.
MARTIN: Nice to meet you. Martin holds out his hand to shake Alex's. She removes one hand from covering her breast to shake his hand. Jonah immediately covers her breast with his hand.
JONAH: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude! Not cool, That's, that wasn't.
MARTIN: That's, that wasn't.
JONAH: Hey, are you serious, Howard Hughes?
JODI: What happened?
MARTIN: Nothing. Nothing happened. Come on.
ALISON: ( TO BEN )
BEN: Look, I forgot you were sleeping over. I'm sorry okay?
ALISON: Yeah, because you were getting high off your huge bong. How am I supposed to be comfortable with the idea that you can take care of me and the baby if you are always getting high?
BEN: You want me to stop smoking pot because there's an earthquake once every ten years? That makes no sense, Alison. You're being irrational. Just relax. We're all scared. Oh, shit, the A cop car rolls by. Ben throws his bong behind him and it SHATTERS on the payment.
BEN: You know it's times like this I'm glad I don't own nice things. It's a big mess, but there's only like fifty bucks worth of shit here. That's kind of the good thing. You know, my dad told me, "Don't move to Northridge." But you figure, what are the chances of that happening twice, you know? Alison picks up a huge sword.
ALISON: What is this?
BEN: It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place doesn't get condemned. That would Alison finds a shopping bag with the baby books they bought. None of them have been read. Alison sadly puts them back without Ben CARD: 28 WEEKS LATER. INT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAY Ben's phone RINGS.

ALISON: Hi! So, listen. Will you do me a big favor? Debbie wants us to come over and have dinner tonight. She thinks Pete is cheating on her.
BEN: Yeah. Well, she saw one of his e-mails and there's an address. Ugh.
ALISON: Yeah. Well, she saw one of his e-mails and there's an address. Ugh.
BEN: Oh, man. I don't want to do that.
ALISON: Ben, come on.
BEN: He's not cheating on her.
ALISON: How do you know?
BEN: I just know.
ALISON: Are you sure?
BEN: I'm one hundred percent sure he's not Are you really?
ALISON: Are you really?
BEN: No. It actually kind of makes sense that he would cheat.
ALISON: Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and Pete's awesome?
BEN: Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and Pete's awesome?
ALISON: Well, why don't you just come over then, and, we'll just diffuse the situation a little?
PETE: I'm just saying the music industry is different now. Steely Dan would never even have a chance.
BEN: Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan gargles my balls.
PETE: They're incredible.
BEN: They really aren't good, man.
PETE: Old Steely Dan.
BEN: If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want you to slice my head off with an Al Jarreau LP.
PETE: I should get going. I'm supposed to see this band tonight in Hollywood. Actually, they're playing in Laurel Canyon, so I'll call you because the reception's terrible over there.
BEN: That's true.
PETE: And I don't want you to worry. I'm just going to jump in the shower. It would be terrible if I smelled worse than the band.
DEBBIE: Okay. Have fun. Ben exits.
BEN: You guys are crazy. He's acting totally normal and hilarious.
BEN: ( TO ALISON )
ALISON: No. I don't think so.
BEN: Oh, great.
BEN: Looks like no one's home.
DEBBIE: Why was the door unlocked? Wait here.
BEN: I just feel bad for Pete.
ALISON: I feel like this isn't a good way to get caught cheating, it shouldn't be like this.
BEN: I feel like this isn't a good way to get caught cheating, it shouldn't be like this.
ALISON: Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he was cheating.
BEN: ( through a fake cough ) Stop it.
ALISON: Stop it.
BEN: I coughed. What do you want from me? Debbie checks upstairs.
DEBBIE: There's nobody up there.
BEN: Thank you.
DEBBIE: I guess I was wrong.
BEN: I told you. Can we get out of here, Yeah, come on. Let's go. A MURMUR comes from a far room.
ALISON: Yeah, come on. Let's go. A MURMUR comes from a far room.
DEBBIE: Did you hear that?
ALISON: I didn't hear anything.
BEN: I didn't hear anything.
ALISON: Come on. Debbie leads them into a room, where Pet sits with a lot of GUYS dressed in baseball clothing.
PETE: Carlos Delgado.
PETE: Oh shit!
PETE: Hideki Matsui.
PETE: Sorry, Charlie.

DEBBIE: What else have you been lying about?
PETE: ( TO ALISON )
BEN: ( TO ALISON )
DEBBIE: Where were you on Wednesday?
PETE: I'm going to be honest with you.
ALISON: ( TO BEN )
BEN: ( TO ALISON )
DEBBIE: That would be a good idea.
PETE: You've been mad because I've been working so much and I didn't want to upset you.
DEBBIE: I wouldn't be mad.
PETE: You would be.
DEBBIE: I don't get mad.
PETE: It's a fantasy baseball draft. I'm not cheating or anything.
DEBBIE: No, this is worse.
PETE: How is this worse?
DEBBIE: This is you wanting to be with your friends more than your family.
PETE: Look, the reason I make that up is because if I told you what I was really doing, you would just get mad. So, you think I'm seeing a band, I do my fantasy draft, and it's win/win.
DEBBIE: Well, what did you do last Wednesday night when you said you went to see a I went to the movies.
PETE: I went to the movies.
DEBBIE: With who?
PETE: By myself.
DEBBIE: What'd you see?
PETE: "Spiderman Three."
DEBBIE: Why do you want to go by yourself? Why didn't you ask me to go?
PETE: Because I needed to get away, you know? With work and you and the kids, sometimes I just need some time to I need time for myself. I want time for myself, too. Debbie holds back tears.
DEBBIE: I need time for myself. I want time for myself, too. Debbie holds back tears.
PETE: It's not that big of a deal.
DEBBIE: ( THROUGH TEARS )
PETE: Okay, so let's see "Spiderman Three" next week.
DEBBIE: I don't want to go see it now.
PETE: I don't want to have to ask you to ask me. I want you to just come up with it on your own.
DEBBIE: I don't want to have to ask you to ask me. I want you to just come up with it on your own.
PETE: What? I don't even know what to say. Uh, what do you want me to do?
DEBBIE: You just think because you don't yell that you're not mean, but this is I'm not being mean. I'm being honest. You're telling me I need to be honest.
PETE: I'm not being mean. I'm being honest. You're telling me I need to be honest.
JUST: No, you're not. You're lying.
DEBBIE: No, you're not. You're lying.
PETE: I'm doing it because I need to keep my sanity a little bit.
DEBBIE: You know what? I don't want you at the house anymore. Okay?
PETE: Come on. Debbie heads for the car.
BEN: Oh, shit, she's coming back.
BEN: How come we go to the gynecologist so often? I bet we have to go so much so we can pay for that three-hundred- thousand-dollar machine he has.
ALISON: I cannot stop thinking about what an asshole Pete is.
BEN: That's a little strong, I would say.
ALISON: Really? Because that had to be one of the most selfish things I've ever It's understandable. I even think it's kind of funny.
BEN: It's understandable. I even think it's kind of funny.
ALISON: What's funny about it?
BEN: Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't imagine, but you know, the situation.
ALISON: Is that what you think?
BEN: Is that what you want to do, Ben?
ALISON: Is that what you want to do, Ben?
BEN: I don't even like baseball. I'm just saying when you're a guy and you have a family and you have responsibility, you lose that male camaraderie, and I get that. I totally understand where he's coming from.
ALISON: Why do you guys always go to that place? You miss male camaraderie. What do I give a shit? Go hang out with your bearded freak friends. I don't care. You want to hang out with guys that look like the Shoe Bomber, it's all on you, man.
BEN: Well what the fuck am I supposed to say to that?
ALISON: You should just support me! You know, you should just support everything I say because at this juncture in my life, I'm allowed to be wrong!
BEN: So if you're wrong, I have to support I can't tell you that you're acting like a lunatic?
ALISON: I can't tell you that you're acting like a lunatic?
BEN: I can't tell you that you're acting like a lunatic?
ALISON: Oh, that's helpful. You have to do I've sacrificed a lot of shit to this!
BEN: I've sacrificed a lot of shit to this!
ALISON: You are just fucking sitting there! You haven't sacrificed anything!
BEN: I have.

ALISON: You know what? Maybe I should take my shoes off. Or my belt buckle. My belt buckle's huge.
ALISON: ( TO BEN )
BEN: Why don't you take off your earrings, too? They weigh about eighty pounds. They're made out of moon rocks aren't Do not make fun of me. Okay? I am hormonal, I am terrified, and I am falling apart, so stop treating everything like it's a big joke!

BEN: I'm sorry you're freaking out, but I just walked three fucking miles through Koreatown to get here. Sorry if I'm trying to lighten the mood a The Nurse leaves.
ALISON: Well, don't! Okay?! You can't take anything seriously! You didn't even read the baby books.
BEN: I didn't read the baby books! What's gonna happen? How did anyone ever give birth without a baby book?!
ALISON: It just shows your lack of commitment, Ben! That you're not in this with me!
BEN: Did you just say my lack of commitment? Because that's what it sounded like. It almost seems as though you forgot I proposed to you like an asshole! And you said no to If you feel that way, you should just go. Really. Just go. Because we didn't mean to do this together, okay? And, and we tried to make it work and that was good, I suppose. Alison holds back tears.

ALISON: Nice. You are such an asshole. You know what? Go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck!
BEN: I will fuck my bong. Doggie-style, for Ben exits while giving Alison the finger as her walks away. Dr. Howard's Nurse returns.
ALISON: I'm really sorry about all that. That was really inappropriate.
ALISON: I don't feel so stupid, then.
BEN: I totally know what you're talking about, man. If I wrote out the list of shit Alison doesn't let me do it would be endless. Don't smoke pot. Don't have samurai swords in your room. Don't have illegal grow operations in the house. I could go on all fucking day. Have I told her to stop doing anything ever? No.
PETE: Marriage is like that show "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it's not funny. All the problems are the same, but it's. Instead of all the funny, pithy dialogue, everybody's just really pissed off and tense. Marriage is like an unfunny, tense version of "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it doesn't last twenty-two minutes. It lasts forever.
BEN: Let's get out of here, man. Honestly, let's just go. Let's go to Vegas.
PETE: Let's do it.

BEN: Holy crap! What happened?
JONAH: We got pink eye.
BEN: What? You giving each other butterfly kisses or something?
JASON: Very funny. That's not how you get pink eye. You get it from poo particles making their way into your ocular cavities.
JAY: Hey, Ben.
BEN: How's it going? I farted on Jason's pillow as a practical joke. He farted on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And then eventually pink-eyes my pillow. I'm not proud of this. But, I think we've all forgiven each other. But, we can't go anywhere.
JAY: How's it going? I farted on Jason's pillow as a practical joke. He farted on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And then eventually pink-eyes my pillow. I'm not proud of this. But, I think we've all forgiven each other. But, we can't go anywhere.

JASON: ( TO PETE )
PETE: Jason shuts the door on Pete.
BEN: This is fun!
PETE: This is great. We're going to have the best time ever.
BEN: We make a good team, man.
PETE: Yep. It's like I can't come here with Debbie. She doesn't understand. It's like she wants to hold me in, and she was telling Alison she could train She thinks she could train me?
BEN: She thinks she could train me?
PETE: Yeah, like you're running the Triple She can't train this! I'm like Siegfried and Roy's Bengal. You think I'm trained. I'll bite your fucking face off.

PETE: Whoa. You got my tie. This is awesome.
BEN: Now that's how you get pink eye.
DOORMAN: ( to the Two Pretty Girls ) Hey, what's up, baby girl? Debbie and Alison move up to the doorman.
DEBBIE: What's up? End of the line, please.

DEBBIE: We come here all the time. It's not a big deal. It doesn't really look that crowded in there.
DOORMAN: Hey, look, I don't make the rules.
DEBBIE: TWO CUTE GIRLS approach. The Doorman lifts the rope for them.
DOORMAN: TWO CUTE GIRLS approach. The Doorman lifts the rope for them.
DEBBIE: What was that? What the fuck was that?

DOORMAN: Yeah, but maybe you should listen to your friend.
DEBBIE: No, you don't need to call me sweetie.
DOORMAN: All right, you want to come in, you're going to have to go to the end of the line and wait like everybody else.

DOORMAN: ( WHISPERING )
DEBBIE: You old. She pregnant. Can't have a bunch of old, pregnant bitches running around. That's crazy. I'm only allowed to let in five percent black people. He said that. Five percent. That mean if there's twenty-five people here, I get to let in one-and-a-quarter black people. So I got to hope there's a black midget in the crowd.

BEN: All the time, man. Like every day. I wonder how you like me.
PETE: How can Debbie like me? She likes me. I mean, she loves me. The biggest problem in our marriage is that she wants me around. She loves me so much that she wants me around all the time. That's our biggest problem. And I can't even accept that? Uh, like that upsets me?! Ben sits up from the bed.

PETE: Tastes like a rainbow.
BEN: You're disgusting. You're an urchin. And she busts your balls because you're a little bitch! You're a filthy bitch! And I'd bust your balls! Debbie wants to give her life to you and Alison doesn't want to do that with me. And it makes me sad all day. I want to go home.
PETE: ( with fist in mouth ) I want to go home, too.
ALISON: Everything looks beautiful.
DEBBIE: Thanks. I went kind of overboard, huh?
ALISON: No, it's great.

PETE: Thanks, Ben.
ALISON: I just don't think we can make it We can get back on track and everything's going to be great.
BEN: We can get back on track and everything's going to be great.
ALISON: You're just being nice. And I'm being nice and just because we're two nice people doesn't mean we should stay together. I don't want this baby to determine the rest of our lives. You know? Me not wanting to do this alone isn't enough of a reason to drag you into a relationship with me. It's just not fair. And, and don't repeat this, but, God, I don't want to end up like But Debbie's happy.
BEN: But Debbie's happy.
ALISON: She's happy today. But every day is a constant struggle for them because they're not right for each other. You know? And they have to force it and I don't want us to have to do that. I don't want to force you to be what I think you should be. That's wrong of me because you're great. You really are. You're great the way you are and, I mean, you like to get high and you like to do shrooms in Vegas.
BEN: I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.
ALISON: And who am I to stop you? Who am I to tell you that that's wrong? It's not wrong. It's who you are. It's what you enjoy and that's your life and.
BEN: I'm not that guy anymore.
ALISON: We can be friends. And you can be there when the baby is born, and in the baby's life as much as you want. I hope you will be.
