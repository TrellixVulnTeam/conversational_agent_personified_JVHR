MAE: ( to the MAN ) Are you somebody?
MAN: No, honey, I'm just a working stiff. The MAN keep walking and MAE returns to her cohorts just as PUPKIN arrives.
MAE: Hi, Rupert.
CELESTE: ( coolly ) Hello, Rupert.
SIDNEY: Who did you get?
PUPKIN: ( distractedly )
MAE: ( to SIDNEY ) I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21.
CELESTE: ( to SIDNEY about PUPKIN ) He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney.
MAE: Then I got him again at the Pierre at four o'clock.
SIDNEY: Be a dear, Mae. I don't happen to have Mr. Vallone.
MAE: You know what I want for him.
SIDNEY: But I have only six Barbra's left. You know how difficult she is to work with.
MAE: I don't have her even once.
CELESTE: ( to MAE ) Maybe Rupert would help you.
SIDNEY: Would you do that, Rupert? You don't feel about Barbra the way I do.
MAE: I'll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too.
CELESTE: ( needling RUPERT ) Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do that sort of thing.
SIDNEY: How about it, Rupert? I'll give you whoever you want. SIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper bag and reading them off.
SIDNEY: Rodney Dangerfield . Richard Harris . Liza Minelli . and she's not so easy to work with either . Louise Lasser!
CELESTE: You're wasting your time. PUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other three. Finally he turns to SIDNEY.
PUPKIN: Look, Sidney. I'm just not interested. This isn't my whole life, you know.
CELESTE: What's that supposed to mean that it's my whole life, or Sidney's or Mae's?
MAE: Shut up, Mae. What about your mother? Isn't she part of your life?
CELESTE: Shut up, Mae. What about your mother? Isn't she part of your life?
MAE: It's her whole life too. The show breaks. The doors swing open and people pour out. The crowd around the backstage door swells.
POLICEMAN: ( to the crowd ) If you want Jerry's autograph, give me your piece of paper and I'll send it backstage.
PUPKIN: ( to the GIRL ) What are you going to do with Jerry's autograph?
YOUNG GIRL: I don't know. Maybe I'll sell it.
BOYFRIEND: I'll tell you what she's going to do with it. She's going to pin
CHAUFFEUR: ( wearily ) No, Mae.
MAE: I don't mean now.
CHAUFFEUR: No, Mae.
MAE: I'll get right out. The CHAUFFEUR, smiling, shakes his head.
MAE: But I've never been in one. We hear a cry as a celebrity emerges from the backstage door. MAE turns and goes back towards the door.
PUPKIN: ( to LANGFORD who barely listens ) How the hell did that girl get in there? Jesus, they certainly don't give you very good protection, do they?
PUPKIN: Look at you here. Who the hell is watching you? Any one of these freaks could just walk right up to you and do whatever he wants. A couple YOUNG GIRLS are pressing against LANGFORD.
FIRST GIRL: Oh, Jerry. How can we get to talk to you?
PUPKIN: Just a minute. This is crazy. PUPKIN straightens up for action.
PUPKIN: ( yelling at the crowd ) Okay! Stand back!
PUPKIN: Didn't you hear me?!? Come on, people, have a heart. The PAGES have succeeded in pulling the GIRL out of the far door of the limo just as PUPKIN and LANGFORD arrive at the near door. The CHAUFFEUR has been blocked by the crowd from opening the door so PUPKIN opens it.
PUPKIN: Stand back! ( To LANGFORD ) Go ahead, LANGFORD slips in quickly. He looks up at PUPKIN who is holding the door, smiling pleasantly.
LANGFORD: Thanks. Thanks very much. PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a moment and then slides into the limo next to him, closing the door behind him.
PUPKIN: I hate to bother you like this, Jerry, but could I speak to you for a minute.
LANGFORD: I'd like to but .
PUPKIN: I know you're a busy man. I promise not to take very long, really. But I need your advice. PUPKIN looks down at his hand which has been badly You don't have a handkerchief, do you? Jesus, these people will kill you for a LANGFORD hands him a monogrammed handkerchief, then checks his watch.
PUPKIN: You don't have a handkerchief, do you? Jesus, these people will kill you for a LANGFORD hands him a monogrammed handkerchief, then checks his watch.
PUPKIN: Thanks. If you have to be somewhere, I don't mind talking as we drive. You can drop me off anywhere.
LANGFORD: Sorry, but I've got a strict rule never to .
PUPKIN: I put myself on the line for you, Jerry. Reluctantly, LANGFORD signals with his head to his CHAUFFEUR to start moving. As the car moves through New York traffic, PUPKIN and LANGFORD talk.
PUPKIN: Thanks, Jerry. I'm grateful for this chance to talk to you . I hope I'm not boring you.
LANGFORD: I'll let you know.
PUPKIN: Really? Fine. I'm Rupert Pupkin, Jerry. I know that the name itself doesn't mean very much to you but it means an awful lot to me, believe me. Maybe you've seen me
LANGFORD: Well .
PUPKIN: Well, up to now, I've been biding my time, developing my act slowly and carefully so that when my big break finally comes, I'm ready like you were that night Paar got sick and you sat in for him. I was there that night, in the theater. That was the most important night of my life, until tonight, of course. PUPKIN fishes a cigarette case out of his jacket pocket, flips it open and offers one to LANGFORD.
LANGFORD: No thanks. I don't smoke. PUPKIN returns the pack to his pocket.
PUPKIN: Me neither. I just carry them as a courtesy. How about a cough drop?
LANGFORD: ( smiling indulgently ) No thanks. I don't cough.
PUPKIN: I try not to but sometimes, you know . Am I making any sense?
LANGFORD: ( smiling ) Go on.
PUPKIN: Well, that night you did Paar, I walked out of the theater like I was in a dream. All of a sudden, I knew what I wanted. I started catching your guest appearances on Sullivan and taping them and, when you got your own show, it got to be a kind of regular thing. I studied how you built to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like you were chatting, and how you delivered
PUPKIN: Look . er . what was the name?
LANGFORD: Look . er . what was the name?
PUPKIN: I'm Rupert, Jerry.
LANGFORD: Look, Rupert. I know what you're saying. But things don't work that way. You can't just walk onto a network show without any experience. You've got to start at the bottom .
PUPKIN: But that's where I am!
LANGFORD: You've got to work your way up, learn your trade in front of live audiences, start playing the little clubs.
PUPKIN: But that can take years, Jerry! Look at me. I'm already 31 years old! People my age are way ahead of me. I've got some catching up to do and I need your help. What do you say, Jerry? All I'm asking you to do is listen to my act. That's all. Is that asking too much?
LANGFORD: I get calls from agents every day. All they want .
PUPKIN: I tried getting an agent. I did, Jerry.
LANGFORD: Look, why don't you call my office.
PUPKIN: Could I?!? Oh, I knew you'd say that, Jerry. You don't know how many times I've had this conversation in my head. And this is the way it always turns out. That's why I had to sort of invite myself into the car tonight. I know it's kind of presumptuous and I really appreciate the time you've given me. But breaks like this don't just happen. You have to make your own breaks. The limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before U.N. Plaza. It stops. LANGFORD gets out. PUPKIN follows.
LANGFORD: Nice meeting you, Rupert. I hope it all works out for you.
PUPKIN: Thanks, Jerry. I don't know how to repay you. I'm a little short on cash this evening, but, if you don't mind some good, hearty food, I'd be honored to take you to dinner.
LANGFORD: Thanks, but some people are waiting for me.
PUPKIN: Oh, I understand. Well, then, maybe I could repay you with a joke. LANGFORD is starting to walk into the building.
PUPKIN: Wait a minute. How's this? The first night you do your show from the coast, you open this way. "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, it's great to be back here in
LANGFORD: ( nodding but unsmiling ) Not bad. Maybe.
PUPKIN: Consider it a gift. Hey, Jerry! How about lunch? My treat!
LANGFORD: ( turning back before he enters the building ) Call my office.
PUPKIN: ( to the handkerchief ) Thanks, Jerry.
VINCENT: I'm sorry, Mr. Langford. ( To PUPKIN, angrily ) How did you get in?
LANGFORD: That's alright, Vincent. Mr. Pupkin's a friend of mine.
VINCENT: ( puzzled ) Oh, I see.
PUPKIN: That's alright. Now if you'd be good enough to find us a nice table. PUPKIN pushes a five dollar bill into VINCENT's hand.
VINCENT: Certainly. This way, please.
VINCENT: Here you are. Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.
LANGFORD: Is Eddie here today, Vincent?
VINCENT: I'll send him over. A WAITER arrives and hands them the menu.
WAITER: Our specialty today is Rizzofino Dolce Acqua a la Marinara con Spezi. Very good.
PUPKIN: Sounds like a new opera.
LANGFORD: Fine. What comes with it?
WAITER: The three laugh.
PUPKIN: Fine. For two.
WAITER: Very good. The WAITER leaves.
PUPKIN: You look tired, Jerry.
LANGFORD: It shows, does it? It's all these problems with the show. That and the custody suit.
PUPKIN: I was sorry to read about that, Jerry. Charlene never should have gotten the kids. If there's anything I can do.
LANGFORD: I appreciate it, Rube. Just talking about it a little with you helps. Eddie arrives. He is a small, slightly-bald man with greying hair and a goatee. He wears a foulard under an open-necked shirt. He carries a long sketch pad. He immediately sets up a small easel and starts sketching.
PUPKIN: Hasn't Eddie already done you?
LANGFORD: Never mind. You were saying .
PUPKIN: Well, I've been giving a lot of thought to your situation, Jerry, ever since I saw you starting to lose ground in the ratings. And I think I know what the problem is. Too many of the same faces.
LANGFORD: Sure, people are getting tired of these people who live off game shows and talk shows and can't really do anything. They've seen 'em and heard 'em till they can't stand it anymore.
PUPKIN: Sure, people are getting tired of these people who live off game shows and talk shows and can't really do anything. They've seen 'em and heard 'em till they can't stand it anymore.
LANGFORD: You know, maybe you're right, Rube.
PUPKIN: I'm sure I am. When a show runs out of surprises, it loses its audience. A YOUNG GIRL stands before PUPKIN and LANGFORD. She hands PUPKIN her autograph book.
PUPKIN: What's your name, dear?
GIRL: ( writing ) To Dolores, who sensed greatness. Rupert Pupkin.
PUPKIN: ( writing ) To Dolores, who sensed greatness. Rupert Pupkin.
GIRL: ( reading it ) Thanks, Mr. Pupkin.
PUPKIN: You see what I mean? What you need on the show is some unknown quantity, some brilliant talent making his television debut. Imagine the suspense. Who is this young guy? How will he do with the eyes of all America on him? Something like that has got to help.
LANGFORD: And that's where you come in.
PUPKIN: Why not? Believe me, Jerry, I'd give you the credit you deserve and I'll stick with you. Anytime you need me, I'll be there, doing a few minutes at Guild scale.
LANGFORD: I'd be grateful, Rube. I really would.
EDDIE: All finished, Mr. Langford. EDDIE turns the caricature so PUPKIN and LANGFORD can see it. It's a picture of the two of them, facing each other and smiling.
PUPKIN: Oh, Jerry, you sneaky .
LANGFORD: Looks good, Eddie. The WAITER arrives with a bottle of champagne.
PUPKIN: What's this?
WAITER: Compliments of Mr. Sardi. EDDIE hangs the picture of LANGFORD and PUPKIN on the wall behind them among the hundreds of other caricatures from Bankhead to Sid Caesar to Bette Davis. The CAMERA PANS over these. We hear the champagne pop.
PUPKIN'S VOICE: How does your afternoon look?
LANGFORD'S VOICE: What have you got in mind?
PUPKIN'S VOICE: Well, we've still got time to catch the Cubs and the Mets out at Shea.
LANGFORD'S VOICE: Why not? But first, a toast. To you, Rube and your success.
PUPKIN'S VOICE: Thanks, Jerry.
PUPKIN: Thanks, Jerry. PUPKIN takes LANGFORD's handkerchief and folds it reverentially, tucking it carefully into his breast pocket. He claps his hands together a few times for joy and dashes into the street to hail a cab.
LANGFORD: ( to the fish ) Say hello to Jerry.
LANGFORD: ( to the fish ) Say hello to Jerry.
LANGFORD: GIRL'S VOICE ( icily )
GIRL'S VOICE: It's Marsha, Jerry. Did you get my note? I left it on the back seat. Did you get it? I dropped it there before they pulled me out. Those guys hurt me, Jerry. ( pause ) Who gave you this number?
LANGFORD: ( icily ) Who gave you this number?
MARSHA'S VOICE: Don't be angry with me, Jerry. I didn't know what else to do; I've been trying you every five minutes, I miss you, baby . Jerry? LANGFORD hangs up the phone and then takes it off the receiver.
LANGFORD: Say goodbye to Jerry. He shakes his head wearily, returns to his dinner and turns to the inside pages of the New York Post.
PUPKIN: RITA comes over. PUPKIN smiles knowingly.
PUPKIN: A beer please, Miss. Something imported.
RITA: Heineken's alright?
PUPKIN: RITA serves him a Heineken's. She stares at him, searching his face.
PUPKIN: How have you been, Rita? She stares again.
RITA: You're not Rupert Pupkin! PUPKIN smiles broadly.
RITA: How the hell did you find me?
PUPKIN: Sally Gardner, I met her after a matinee. Aren't you glad to see me?
RITA: Sure, sure. How is old Sally?
PUPKIN: The same, I guess. You know, two kids, a nice husband, living in Clifton.
RITA: It figures.
PUPKIN: A lot of the kids in our class have moved back.
RITA: What are you doing here?
PUPKIN: I just thought I'd say hello. Here, I brought you a little something.
RITA: ( recognizing his style ) Oh, yeah, Mr. Romance.
PUPKIN: Don't forget to put in an aspirin. It lasts longer. RITA fills a glass of water and puts in the rose.
RITA: Nothing's gonna keep it alive in this place.
PUPKIN: How have you been, dear, sweet Rita?
RITA: I don't have an aspirin.
PUPKIN: Maybe a Rolaids would work. PUPKIN pulls out a pack of Rolaids and hands one to RITA who smiles vaguely and drops it into the glass.
RITA: Well, what are you up to these days, Didn't you know you'd see me again?
PUPKIN: Didn't you know you'd see me again?
RITA: You still going to the movies?
PUPKIN: You're looking as beautiful as ever.
RITA: Oh, yeah. I was a real knockout.
PUPKIN: I thought so.
RITA: Well, here I am. Local cheerleader makes good.
PUPKIN: I voted for you for Most Beautiful.
RITA: I didn't have the nerve to tell you then, but I guess it's alright now.
PUPKIN: I didn't have the nerve to tell you then, but I guess it's alright now.
RITA: Well, nothing terrible's gonna happen, if that's what you mean. There is an awkward pause. PUPKIN stares admiringly at
RITA: Well, how are things with you, Rupert?
PUPKIN: Great! Everything's starting to break.
RITA: Is that right?
PUPKIN: Yeah. As a matter of fact, that's why I'm here. I've known about this place for a long time. I just didn't want to make my move until I had something to offer you. Everything's a question of timing.
PUPKIN: What's the matter? RITA shakes her head in disbelief and chuckles.
RITA: Jesus Christ, Rupert Pupkin!
PUPKIN: ( smiling ) The two of us are often confused. He's the one with the famous father.
PUPKIN: ( critically ) You like this place?
RITA: Why, you got something better?
PUPKIN: What are you doing tonight?
RITA: What are you doing tonight?
PUPKIN: What are you doing tonight?
RITA: RITA starts laughing.
PUPKIN: ( smiling reluctantly ) What's so funny?
RITA: ( still laughing ) You call me up all junior and senior year. Night after night after night, right? And every time I'm wondering 'when is this guy going to stop talking and ask me out?' Well, now I know the answer. August twelfth, nineteen seventy-six. It only took you ten, eleven years to work up to it.
PUPKIN: If I had asked you out? Would you have gone?
RITA: Oh, no.
PUPKIN: Why not? RITA starts laughing again.
RITA: Because I thought you were a jerk!
PUPKIN: You see! I was right! But that guy isn't me anymore. I look at my picture in the yearbook and I don't even recognize myself. I'm not the same guy, Rita. A bull-necked MAN in his early forties enters. He waves a brief hello to RITA as he walks by. RITA smiles and the MAN takes a seat at the far end of the bar.
MAN: ( to PUPKIN ) Excuse me a minute, honey.
RITA: ( to PUPKIN ) Excuse me a minute, honey.
PUPKIN: I'm not honey! I'm Rupert. RITA goes to the far end of the bar and serves the MAN a beer. They chat briefly as PUPKIN watches uneasily. Finally PUPKIN downs his beer and raises his glass.
PUPKIN: Miss! Miss! The MAN gets RITA's attention for PUPKIN. RITA returns to PUPKIN and serves him another beer.
PUPKIN: I'm in the mood to celebrate tonight. Why don't we go to this nice restaurant I know, talk over and times, get to know each other all over again.
RITA: And then?
PUPKIN: Well, tomorrow night I thought we'd go out again, talk some more, get to know each other even better.
RITA: How much?
PUPKIN: How much what?
RITA: How much do we have to get to know each other?
PUPKIN: I don't understand.
RITA: ( emphatically ) How much do we have to get to know each other before we start talking about that job?
PUPKIN: I'm not talking about any job.
RITA: Then what's this big offer you were talking about?
PUPKIN: You'll see. Right now I'm asking you for a date. How about it?
RITA: I'm sorry, Rupert. But I'm busy.
PUPKIN: Yeah. Busy.
RITA: Yeah. Busy.
PUPKIN: But this is the biggest night of my life.
RITA: I've already got a date. The MAN at the end of the bar raises his glass.
MAN: RITA goes to the far end of the bar. She pours him another beer and settles against the bar, resuming her chat with him. PUPKIN looks for a moment and downs his beer. He raises his glass.
PUPKIN: Miss! Miss! RITA returns to him.
PUPKIN: Is that your date?
RITA: None of your business.
PUPKIN: What do you want to go out with
RITA: He's a good friend of mine.
PUPKIN: What's so important about tonight?
RITA: What's so important about tonight?
PUPKIN: Everything! You don't understand.
RITA: No. I don't. It's been really nice seeing you, Rupert. Thanks for dropping in. But I've got some work to do. RITA leaves PUPKIN and returns to the far end of the bar where she once again resumes talking with the MAN. PUPKIN sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john.
PUPKIN: RITA walks over reluctantly.
PUPKIN: Listen to me for a second.
RITA: I have work to do, Rupert.
PUPKIN: Just listen. I'm at the start of something really big. I don't want to talk about it here but it's going to happen soon and it's going to be great for both of us.
RITA: No kidding?
PUPKIN: So see that guy some other night.
MAN: RITA turns to go.
PUPKIN: But I haven't finished! RITA returns to the MAN and pours him another beer. PUPKIN sits for a few moments, then downs his beer quickly. Again, he raises his glass.
PUPKIN: Miss! Miss! The MAN leans over the bar and tells RITA something. She opens a bottle of beer and hands it to the MAN who slides it down the bar towards PUPKIN. As the beer reaches the middle of the bar, the THIRD MAN seated midway between PUPKIN and the MAN raises his beer glass to take a sip just as the sliding beer bottle passes under his hand. The bottle stops right in front of PUPKIN who takes it and slides it back with equal force. At this moment, the THIRD MAN in the middle has finished his sip and has just placed the THIRD MAN's glass on the counter. The beer bottle collides with the THIRD MAN's glass, creating a mess. RITA glares at PUPKIN as does the THIRD MAN. PUPKIN shrugs an apology and RITA cleans up the mess.
RITA: ( to the THIRD MAN ) I'll get you another one.
MAN: ( to PUPKIN ) Look, friend. I'm trying to have a nice civilized conversation with the young lady. Be a good little lad, huh, and give us a break.
PUPKIN: Miss! Miss! The MAN advances towards PUPKIN with another bottle of beer. PUPKIN watches passively as the MAN pours half the bottle into PUPKIN's breast pocket and slams the half-empty bottle on the counter. The MAN walks down to the end of the counter where a smiling RITA is waiting. PUPKIN again gulps his beer down. RITA and the MAN stare at PUPKIN expecting him to raise his glass and call for another beer. PUPKIN just sits there. After a few moments, RITA and the MAN resume their conversation, but they keep glancing over at PUPKIN, expecting him to interrupt them with a call for beer at any moment. PUPKIN continues to sit there. Just as RITA and the MAN have settled back into their conversation, PUPKIN falls like a stone from the barstool onto the floor. He lies motionless. RITA and the MAN look at PUPKIN for a moment while the handful of other patrons glance at him and return to their drinks. RITA leaves the bar and goes to the rear of the restaurant, disappearing into the kitchen. As she does, the MAN walks over to where PUPKIN is lying inert and prods him cruelly with his foot.
MAN: C'mon, schmuck, wake up so I can kick your ass outta here. The MAN turns to the kitchen to see if RITA is returning. As he does, PUPKIN carefully opens one eye, grabs a free chair from a nearby cocktail table, rises and bangs the MAN smartly over the head. The MAN falls, out cold. PUPKIN straightens up quickly as the other patrons look on with interest. PUPKIN brushes off his suit, which is blue, just like the MAN's, and stands above the MAN just as the MAN stood above him, his back to kitchen. RITA emerges from the kitchen with the owner, MR. NICHOLS and a large black
RITA: ( to NICHOLS ) He was making trouble one minute and the next he was on the floor.
COOK: Okay, buddy, here we go. NICHOLS and the COOK lead the MAN, who is still groggy, out of the bar as RITA continues to stare at PUPKIN with a mixture of curiosity and amusement.
RITA: Okay, Tarzan. Where do we eat tonight?
RITA: Another one, Chan.
PUPKIN: ( to WAITER ) Chopsticks, please.
RITA: So all this time you've been thinking about me, huh?
PUPKIN: That's right, Rita.
RITA: What kinds of things were you thinking? PUPKIN drops his eyes shyly. RITA starts laughing.
RITA: Oh, ho! Those kinds of things! Shame on you, Rupert.
PUPKIN: Rita, I assure you there was .
RITA: Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person!
PUPKIN: Come on, Rita. People will hear.
RITA: ( in a whisper ) Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person. Oh, come on, Rupert. Relax. Have a little fun.
PUPKIN: This is a very important evening to me, Did you know your nose wiggled when you talked?
RITA: Did you know your nose wiggled when you talked?
PUPKIN: It does?
RITA: Yeah. Just the tip. Like a rabbit. ( pause ) Hey, are we gonna eat or what? I'm starving. PUPKIN serves RITA.
RITA: It always looks like they put worms in this stuff.
PUPKIN: Just taste. RITA tastes.
RITA: Well, I guess it won't kill me.
PUPKIN: This is supposed to be the finest Cantonese cuisine in the city.
RITA: Yeah? Then what happened to the PUPKIN drops his eyes.
RITA: Oh, don't worry about it. This is
PUPKIN: I used to see you at the Garden every year.
RITA: Oh, the Follies. That was the right name for 'em. How did you know which one was me? We all looked like chickens. What I mean is, we all looked like the same chicken. I thought it was gonna be Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I wind up looking like Henny Penny. RITA chuckles to herself.
PUPKIN: You just didn't get the breaks.
RITA: Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn't have the money for the right coach. But what difference does it make? She starts laughing to herself.
RITA: I remember once we were down in Atlanta and the ice machine broke down. We did three hours of slush. Everyone was falling on their faces and hopping up with their arms open for a bow like the whole thing was planned. And the people ate it up.
PUPKIN: I liked the show.
RITA: Yeah? The Follies? You really must have been carrying the torch. What did you think when I got married? You knew I got married?
PUPKIN: I knew it wouldn't last.
RITA: You think I should have married you, instead, huh?
PUPKIN: If he'd only been hit by a train. He was worth a helluva lot more dead than alive, I can tell you that. RITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearby, talking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking young MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of beer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA smiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG MAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER comes over and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the scene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and the

PUPKIN: Are you seeing anyone? RITA starts for a moment, thinking PUPKIN has caught her looking at the YOUNG MAN.
RITA: What do you mean?
PUPKIN: I want to know about the competition, that's all.
RITA: Well, tomorrow night, I've got a date with Joe Namath you know Joe. And Thursday - let's see
PUPKIN: I'm serious, Rita.
RITA: ( imitating him ) I'm serious, Rita. ( In her own voice ) Sure I see people. I'm not a nun, Rupert. I see a lot of people.
PUPKIN: Anyone special?
RITA: ( chuckling ) You mean am I "going steady"? Rupert, I'm thirty-one years old!
PUPKIN: What about that guy tonight?
RITA: Why him?
PUPKIN: Why him?
RITA: What am I supposed to do, huh? Sit home watching TV? He's just some guy. He's got his own aluminum siding business. He comes into the city sometimes, that's all.
PUPKIN: You don't go out with him for his Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do you think they pay me in that dump? Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get the world's greatest tippers in there either. Somebody has to take care of That's what I want to talk to you about, Rita. The WAITER arrives with RITA's drink.
RITA: Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do you think they pay me in that dump? Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get the world's greatest tippers in there either. Somebody has to take care of That's what I want to talk to you about, Rita. The WAITER arrives with RITA's drink.
PUPKIN: That's what I want to talk to you about, Rita. The WAITER arrives with RITA's drink.
PUPKIN: Who's your favorite movie star?
RITA: You are, Rupert. Especially your nose.
PUPKIN: Just tell me.
RITA: Is this some kind of game? Are you going to tell me something about my You'll see. Give me his name.
PUPKIN: You'll see. Give me his name.
RITA: I can't think of anybody.
PUPKIN: You've got to have one, Rita. Everybody Okay. Okay. Let's see. ( pause ) Marilyn Monroe. PUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his inside jacket pocket.
RITA: Okay. Okay. Let's see. ( pause ) Marilyn Monroe. PUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his inside jacket pocket.
RITA: Oh, Rupert! Are we going to exchange
RITA: That's her name.
PUPKIN: Her name! She signed this herself, especially for me. RITA starts flipping through the book, curious about the other names. She isn't paying any attention to what PUPKIN is saying.
PUPKIN: She wasn't a great actress but she had a real gift for comedy. She died tragically, you know, alone, like so many of the world's most beautiful women. I'm going to see that doesn't happen to you, Rita.
RITA: Who's this one? PUPKIN checks the book.
PUPKIN: Burt Reynolds.
RITA: Oh yeah, the guy with no clothes. Who's this?
PUPKIN: Mel Brooks.
RITA: And this?
PUPKIN: Carol Burnett.
RITA: No kidding. How about this?
PUPKIN: Glenda Jackson.
RITA: Never heard of her.
PUPKIN: ( pointing to other names ) And that's Woody Allen and there's
RITA: You don't really know any of these Take a look at this. PUPKIN flips to one of the back pages and shows a name to
PUPKIN: Take a look at this. PUPKIN flips to one of the back pages and shows a name to
RITA: ( squinting ) I can't make it out.
PUPKIN: This is really weird handwriting! Exasperated, PUPKIN follows the name in question with his index finger.
RITA: This is really weird handwriting! Exasperated, PUPKIN follows the name in question with his index finger.
PUPKIN: Rooooper ..
RITA: ( guessing ) It is?
PUPKIN: It is?
RITA: It is?
PUPKIN: No! It's . it's Rupert Pupkin PUPKIN tears out the page and hands it to her shyly. RITA just stares at it and back at PUPKIN.
PUPKIN: Don't lose it. It's going to be worth something in a couple of weeks. RITA start laughing.
PUPKIN: That's what I've been trying to tell you. Things are really breaking for me. I'm ticketed for stardom. RITA laughs harder, despite efforts to be serious.
PUPKIN: Only a couple of hours ago, I was talking to Jerry Langford, the Jerry Langford. Stop it, Rita! RITA pulls herself together for a moment.
PUPKIN: We were talking about my doing my act on his show.
RITA: ( suppressing a smile ) Your act?
PUPKIN: Get that guy you knew from Clifton out of your head right now. You're looking at Rupert Pupkin, Rita. Rupert Pupkin, the new King of Comedy. RITA starts laughing hysterically, in spite of herself.
RITA: ( getting a grip on herself ) I'm sorry.
PUPKIN: Why not me, Rita? A guy can always get what he wants if he's willing to pay the price. All it takes is a little talent and sacrifice and the right break. If you've got a friend in the right place, that's all it takes. And that's exactly what I have going for me right now. After all, crazier things have happened. RITA listens silently for a moment, then begins to giggle. As PUPKIN resumes speaking, we CUT between RITA and the YOUNG MAN. Their flirtation picks up steam. The YOUNG MAN raises his eyebrows as if to ask, "Are you interested in me?" She smiles. All the while, PUPKIN rattles on.
PUPKIN: You just don't realize what a shot on the Langford Show can mean. That's coast to coast, national TV, a bigger audience than the greatest comedians used to play to in a lifetime. A shot like that means a free ticket on the comedy circuit Flip Wilson one week, Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or Carol Burnett. And you've always got those other talk shows to fall back on Carson, Griffin. And all that leads straight in one direction, Rita Hollywood! That's when we really start
RITA: It sounds wonderful, Rupert, and I really hope you get what you want. But it's getting late and I'm a working girl. You know what I mean? The telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing. A WAITER in the background moves slowly to answer it.
PUPKIN: You going to spend the rest of your life in that place? Is that what you really want, talking about nothing with nothings? I thought you wanted something a little better than that and that's what I'm offering. Every King needs a Queen, Rita. I want you to be mine. What do you say?
RITA: You really want to help me out? You see this. ( She points to her lower back molar ) A hundred seventy-five bucks. If you could spare fifty, say, until next Monday, that would keep three people really happy me, my landlord and my dentist. During RITA's speech, the WAITER has been working his way from the phone booth towards the front of the restaurant.
WAITER: Telephone for you, Miss.
RITA: ( looking puzzled ) Me? Nobody knows I'm here. You didn't tell anybody, did you?
PUPKIN: ( getting up ) What the hell's going on?
RITA: ( getting up ) What the hell's going on?
RITA: MAN'S VOICE
MAN'S VOICE: Who is this?
RITA: Who is this?
MAN'S VOICE: Who do you think it is? I've been staring at you all evening.
RITA: Where are you? The YOUNG MAN taps forcefully with his index finger on the glass door of his booth. RITA, hearing the noise, turns around and finds herself staring at the YOUNG MAN. She PUPKIN at the table looking over the check. He gets out a ten dollar bill. RITA emerges from the booth in nervous high spirits.
RITA: ( with repressed gaiety ) You know who that was the bar. I have to go back to work.
PUPKIN: How did they know you were here?
RITA: ( gathering her things ) I guess I must have told them. They need someone right away.
PUPKIN: ( accusingly ) You don't even care, do you?
RITA: Oh, no. I do. Really!
PUPKIN: It's not the bar, Rita. Don't tell me it's the bar.
RITA: Don't be angry. It has nothing to do with you. I had a nice dinner, really. It was great seeing you PUPKIN stare at her icily.
RITA: Come on. Let's see a smile.
PUPKIN: Why don't we finish the evening up at the bar together? End the evening where it began?
RITA: After what happened there?
PUPKIN: Well, I could at least drop you off!
RITA: ( hurriedly making up her face ) That's okay. Really. I can manage. Why don't you just go to a movie or something? Don't let me spoil your But that wouldn't be right.
PUPKIN: But that wouldn't be right. RITA gets up and stands before PUPKIN.
RITA: ( firmly ) Look, Rupert. It's been a lot of fun, really. I'll see you sometime, huh?
PUPKIN: But Rita! RITA starts moving towards the door.
RITA: Come on, Rupert. I'm in a hurry. RITA marches out with PUPKIN trailing behind. He throws the check and the ten dollar bill at the CASHIER.
YOUNG MAN: Welcome to the pleasure dome.
RITA: You don't kid around, do you?
YOUNG MAN: ( smiling ) I do alright. What's your libation?
RITA: YOUNG MAN
YOUNG MAN: Your potion. Your drink.
RITA: Bourbon and soda. Make it light. The YOUNG MAN goes to his chic little bar and starts fixing RITA a strong bourbon and soda. He also fixes himself a strong scotch and water. As he works, they talk.
YOUNG MAN: You from the South?
RITA: YOUNG MAN
YOUNG MAN: That's what Southern people drink. Lots of bourbon.
RITA: What do people from Jersey drink?
YOUNG MAN: I make it a point to study things like that. It's important to know people's backgrounds, their tastes, their culture. It gives you a little head start. The YOUNG MAN turns from the bar and hands RITA her drink.
YOUNG MAN: I'm Chet. Whom do I have the pleasure of serving?
RITA: I'm Mary.
YOUNG MAN: Pleased to meat you, Mary. ( He lifts his glass ) To our evening.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Rita Keane. I want to talk to her.
PUPKIN: Rita Keane. I want to talk to her.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Rita Keane?
PUPKIN: That's right. Oh, never mind. I must have the wrong apartment.
WOMAN'S VOICE: There's no Rita here.
PUPKIN: I know. I know. I'm sorry to bother You must have the wrong apartment.
WOMAN'S VOICE: You must have the wrong apartment.
PUPKIN: I'm sorry. PUPKIN pushes 4B.
YOUNG MAN: Leisure is America's fastest growing industry. Did you know that? Think about it. Short work weeks, more vacation. People need something to do with all that time and that's where I come in. Leisure Villages, Inc. We buy land an hour or so outside your metropolitan centers. We set up the bungalows, dig some lakes, lay out a golf course, you know, fix the whole place up so it's usable. Then young, personable guys like me show the people around. It the guy seems tight, we point out the investment factor. If he's a swinger, well, the bungalows are very private. If he's a sports nut, we talk up skiing and fishing and tennis. The phonograph starts playing Burt Bachrach.
YOUNG MAN: What's your work, Mary? The YOUNG MAN walks back to her and stands over her.
RITA: Me. I fly for National.
YOUNG MAN: ( delighted ) No kidding?
RITA: What's that smell?
YOUNG MAN: Sandalwood incense. It seemed very PUPKIN yells into the intercom.
PUPKIN: We hear the intercom at the other end click off. PUPKIN pauses a moment and pushes 4C.
YOUNG MAN: Did you know that you have remarkable Yeah? You know what? I feel like going to a movie.
RITA: Yeah? You know what? I feel like going to a movie.
YOUNG MAN: Sure. Why not? It's only twenty of ten. We can make a ten o'clock show. The YOUNG MAN takes her hands and looks deep into her eyes.
RITA: Sure. Why not? It's only twenty of ten. We can make a ten o'clock show. The YOUNG MAN takes her hands and looks deep into her eyes.
YOUNG MAN: Why don't we make our own movie?
RITA: No. I don't think so.
YOUNG MAN: Don't be so uptight. Give it a chance.
RITA: I want to go to the movies, that's all.
YOUNG MAN: We can go to the movies later. RITA pulls her hands away.
RITA: Let's stop playing games, okay. I'm not a kid.
YOUNG MAN: You have something against pleasure?
RITA: I'm just not interested in being tonight's ritual sacrifice, okay?
YOUNG MAN: Shall I freshen up your drink? RITA shakes her head.
YOUNG MAN: ( growing irritated ) What exactly did you think we were going to do up here?
MAN'S VOICE: CUT TO:
YOUNG MAN: Look, if you've got sexual problems let's talk about them. It helps clear the air.
RITA: There's nothing wrong with
YOUNG MAN: Then it's me?
RITA: I don't even know you.
YOUNG MAN: Then find out. Sex is a great way of breaking down barriers.
RITA: I don't think so.
YOUNG MAN: I'm sure this could lead to something The YOUNG MAN kisses RITA roughly.
YOUNG MAN: Passive resistance, huh?
RITA: Let's just write this thing off as a big mistake. What do you say?
YOUNG MAN: What's wrong with me?
RITA: Nothing. I just want to go home.
YOUNG MAN: I can see I'm not turning you on.
RITA: ( smiles ) You noticed that, huh?
YOUNG MAN: Come on. What's wrong with me?
RITA: You really want to know?
YOUNG MAN: How can I put it? Well, it's like you've got your fly open and your tongue hanging out.
RITA: How can I put it? Well, it's like you've got your fly open and your tongue hanging out.
YOUNG MAN: I'm really a very sensitive person.
RITA: Come on. Get offa me.
YOUNG MAN: Sometimes I write poetry. RITA pulls herself away.
RITA: YOUNG MAN
YOUNG MAN: So you wanna play hard to get, huh? The YOUNG MAN grabs her.
RITA: Come on. Let's talk this over.
YOUNG MAN: I admire you very much. I respect you, Mary.
RITA: ( her eyes beginning to fill with terror ) You're hurting me.
YOUNG MAN: I'm only doing what you want.
RITA: ( pleading, on the verge of tears ) Oh, please.
YOUNG MAN: Afterwards, you'll thank me. The buzzer sounds with great force. It is one, long,
PUPKIN: ( in desperation ) What do you want?
RITA: ( in desperation ) What do you want?
PUPKIN: Don't be angry with me. I was worried about you, that's all.
RITA: Just go home and leave me alone. PUPKIN take off his jacket and puts if around RITA's Here. You'll need this. It's getting I'm so
PUPKIN: ( quietly ) Here. You'll need this. It's getting I'm so
RITA: I'm so
PUPKIN: Don't say that, Rita. Everyone does crazy things.
RITA: Not all the time.
PUPKIN: I'll get us a cab. PUPKIN rushes into the street and hails a cab.
NIGHT: WE SEE the taxi pull up in front of one of those middle-
RITA: Well, I guess you're entitled to come up for coffee.
PUPKIN: That's okay, Rita. You're tired and I know I'm not always the easiest guy to be with. There is a pause.
RITA: ( puzzled ) What do you want, Rupert?
PUPKIN: ( softly ) You don't understand anything, do you? I love you, Rita. I want to change your life . if you'll only give me a
PUPKIN: Look, what if I arranged it so you could meet Jerry? You'd have to believe me if you heard it from him.
RITA: There's no .
PUPKIN: I'll arrange that, Rita. We'll all go out to dinner some night or maybe out to his place, on a weekend. You'll see. The trouble with you is you've got no faith. Now go to bed and get a good rest and I'll see you in a couple of days. PUPKIN gives RITA a very gentle, sweet kiss on the Now run along in.
PUPKIN: ( gently ) Now run along in.
PUPKIN: Go on. RITA turns slowly and goes in. She looks back. PUPKIN is PUPKIN carries a large manila folder into 424 Madison. As usual, he is impeccably dressed.
RECEPTIONIST: PUPKIN hands the RECEPTIONIST the package.
PUPKIN: I need somebody to sign. You can sign anything you want Cary Grant, Art Carney, I don't care. The RECEPTIONIST signs.
PUPKIN: Would you mind very much if I used your phone? It's local.
RECEPTIONIST: Don't be, long. Dial nine. PUPKIN takes out a little piece of paper from his suit pocket and dials a number.
PUPKIN: ( tense, nervous ) May I speak to Jerry Langford, please? Thanks . Jerry Langford, please. Rupert Pupkin . Jerry knows. I'm calling at his request . I see. That's alright. I'll call him again.
RECEPTIONIST: That's not Jerry Langford, the .
PUPKIN: ( smiling proudly )
PUPKIN: Jerry Langford, please . May I speak to Jerry Langford, please . Rupert Pupkin, I called earlier . I see. How long do you expect that'll last? Oh, fine. I'm at ( PUPKIN checks the number on the phone ) CH 4-1482 . I'll be here for another half hour, forty- five minutes. Please be sure he gets my message. Thanks. PUPKIN hangs up.
RECEPTIONIST: Yes sir?
PUPKIN: Mr. Langford, please.
RECEPTIONIST: Your name?
PUPKIN: Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin. The RECEPTIONIST puts a call through. Wide-eyed, PUPKIN observes the blow-ups of Langford talking with various LANGFORD is seated at his desk on stage and PUPKIN is his guest. WE SEE television cameras and in the background, the control room.
PUPKIN: You know the secret of dieting, Jerry? Grapefruit. It's good for you. It's filling. And it's low in calories.
LANGFORD: ( to the camera ) Take note of that, you ladies.
PUPKIN: As a matter of fact, yesterday I went to the outdoor market near where I live and I bought twenty grapefruit. The grocer looked at me and said, "What are you gonna do with all those?" So I bent over and told him ( in a confidential tone ) "I'm gonna take 'em back to Florida and set 'em free!" LANGFORD and the AUDIENCE laugh heartily.
RECEPTIONIST: ( holding the phone and talking to PUPKIN ) I'm sorry, Mr. Pupkin, but Mr. Langford's secretary has no record of any appointment.
PUPKIN: Pardon me?
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Langford's secretary has no record of any appointment.
PUPKIN: Well, technically speaking, I don't actually have an appointment. Jerry asked me to call him today and when I couldn't get through, I thought . As PUPKIN talks, a VISITOR has entered and stands behind him waiting for the RECEPTIONIST's attention.
RECEPTIONIST: I see. ( Into the phone ) He says Mr. Langford asked him to call. ( To PUPKIN ) Mr. Langford's secretary wants to know what this is in reference to. The RECEPTIONIST glances past PUPKIN to the VISITOR Would you mind talking to her yourself? The RECEPTIONIST hands the phone to PUPKIN and occupies herself with the VISITOR.
RECEPTIONIST: ( to PUPKIN ) Would you mind talking to her yourself?
PUPKIN: Hello? . Jerry and I discussed my being on the show last night and he told me to call . No. I don't PUPKIN hands the phone back to the RECEPTIONIST.
PUPKIN: I'm supposed to wait. The RECEPTIONIST listens to the phone for a moment and then hangs up. The VISITOR has just disappeared into the back offices. PUPKIN stands there, smiling politely at the RECEPTIONIST who returns a professional smile.
PUPKIN: Who was that gentleman? ( PUPKIN
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Gangemi. PUPKIN draws a complete blank but wants to appear Oh, I see. Mr. Gangemi.
PUPKIN: Oh, I see. Mr. Gangemi.
RECEPTIONIST: He takes care of our air conditioning. CATHY LONG emerges from the back offices. She is a tall, modishly-dressed, attractive woman in her early thirties.
CATHY LONG: Uh . Mr. Pupkin?
PUPKIN: CATHY LONG
CATHY LONG: I'm Cathy Long.
PUPKIN: I'm Mr. Pupkin.
CATHY LONG: Can I help you?
PUPKIN: I'm sorry, but you are?
CATHY LONG: I'm Bert Thomas' assistant.
PUPKIN: Bert Thomas?
CATHY LONG: He's our executive producer.
PUPKIN: Oh, yes. I'm sure he is. But, you see, I've already talked directly with Jerry about my being on the show and he told me to get in touch with him. I'm just here to follow up on What do you do, Mr. Pupkin?
CATHY LONG: What do you do, Mr. Pupkin?
PUPKIN: Stand-up comedy.
CATHY LONG: Fine. Where are you working?
PUPKIN: Well, right now I'm developing new I see. Well, as soon as you start performing again, let us know where you are and I'll send my assistant down to check you out.
PUPKIN: Sure. Sure. But that's not necessary, Miss Long. Jerry and I already went over all this.
CATHY LONG: Does Jerry know your work?
PUPKIN: ( nodding ) Yes. I don't think he does.
CATHY LONG: You don't happen to have a tape or a demo that we might listen to?
PUPKIN: Oh, sure. I've got lots of tapes. That's no problem.
CATHY LONG: Good. Why don't you just send one to us and I assure you we'll listen to it promptly.
PUPKIN: Great. I'll do that. I can see that'd be a lot easier for Jerry. Thanks a lot, Miss Long.
CATHY LONG: Don't mention it, Mr. Pupkin. Now, if you'd excuse me .
PUPKIN: Sure. Sure. Thanks again. CATHY LONG leaves. PUPKIN, left standing there, smiles at the RECEPTIONIST who returns another professional smile.
PUPKIN: ( to the RECEPTIONIST ) PUPKIN comes out of the building elated. He is immediately confronted by MARSHA. PUPKIN continues to walk as MARSHA skips beside him.
MARSHA: I've got to speak to you for a minute. I'm Marsha.
PUPKIN: Yeah. I know.
MARSHA: Look. Did Jerry say anything about me last night?
PUPKIN: I'm really in a hurry, Marsha .
MARSHA: Was he angry? . In the car last night, I saw you. Did he talk about me?
PUPKIN: I thought that was you. That was some stunt.
MARSHA: What did he say?
PUPKIN: We didn't talk about you.
MARSHA: You know Jerry?
PUPKIN: MARSHA thrusts an envelope into PUPKIN's hands.
MARSHA: Give him this for me.
PUPKIN: Why don't you .
MARSHA: Because I your help. You'll be my friend forever. Come on. I'll buy you something. What do you want? She takes a great messy bunch of bills out of her raincoat
PUPKIN: I don't want this.
MARSHA: Take it. I can get all I want. PUPKIN shrugs and pockets the money.
PUPKIN: Okay. I'll try.
MARSHA: ( turning cold ) Don't try. Do it. Remember. We just made a deal.
MARSHA: And don't open it. It's private.
PUPKIN: Okay. Okay.
MARSHA: How soon can you get it to him?
PUPKIN: I don't know. Couple a days.
MARSHA: ( menacingly ) You'd better.
MARSHA: gave him. There are wads of tens, twenties and fifties with a sprinkling of fives and ones.
PUPKIN: Testing. Testing. Testing. In the following montage, we hear in the background the replay of his "testing, testing testing" and various other noises a bit of his voice taped, a burst of laughter, the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward, a sudden burst of applause, a scrap of theme music. At the same time, the CAMERA PANS about the room. We look at the collages which include all the obvious show business figures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin and Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen. The collages also include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia Childs, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Clifford Irving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz. There is a special Kennedy section John F. and Bobby framed in black, Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also a trio of assassins Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray. There is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford in the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters, Carson and Griffin. One bookshelf holds a veritable library of comedy joke books, biographies of comedians, treasuries of American humor. Another shelf holds scores of tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marked, i.e., "LANGFORD MONOLOGUES: 7/5/72 to 9/9/72." "MISC. MONOLOGUES 6/13/68 to 8/1/69."
PUPKIN: First, Miss Long. Thanks very much for your help at the office and for passing this along to Jerry. I appreciate it more than you know. PUPKIN stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few beats. He then starts the large recorder.
PUPKIN: Now, Jerry. Before I begin, I just want to thank you for listening to this material and for the opportunity that you've given me. You know, lots of people think that guys like you, you know, people who have made it, lose their feeling for struggling
PUPKIN: . the comedy find of the year making his television debut, Rupert Pupkin, the King of Comedy! PUPKIN rapidly races the cassette tape forward, then pushes down the "play" button. We hear a burst of thundering applause. PUPKIN lets the applause run for a while and then shuts it off. The large recorder keeps rolling.
PUPKIN: Now you come on, Jerry, and do your monologue. Then, when the time comes, this is how I see you introducing me. You'll say something like this. "Ladies and Gentlemen we're going to do something a little bit different tonight. It isn't often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business. After all, the verdict is always in your hands. But I think after you've met my next guest, that you'll agree with me that he's destined for greatness. So, now, will you please give your warmest welcome to the newest King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!"
PUPKIN: Will somebody tell that lovely lady that the applause sign is off. The audience laughs.
PUPKIN: That's a possible introduction, Jerry. Now let's move on to my act.
CATHY LONG: ( suddenly a bit shy ) I didn't want to take any chances with this . uh . Miss Long, so I . uh . thought I'd just bring it here myself. We talked about this this morning, did we, Mr. . ?
PUPKIN: ( suddenly a bit shy ) I didn't want to take any chances with this . uh . Miss Long, so I . uh . thought I'd just bring it here myself. We talked about this this morning, did we, Mr. . ?
CATHY LONG: We talked about this this morning, did we, Mr. . ?
PUPKIN: Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.
CATHY LONG: Oh, yes. It's been some day. ( pause ) Well, I certainly appreciate your bringing this over, Mr. Pupkin, and we'll listen to it as soon as possible.
PUPKIN: Fine. Er . you don't have any idea how soon that might be?
CATHY LONG: Well, you can try checking with us tomorrow. We might know something by then. Otherwise, it'll have to be Monday.
PUPKIN: What if I just sort of waited around here today, just in case? I'll stay out of the way.
CATHY LONG: You'd just be wasting your time, Mr. Pupkin. We won't know anything until tomorrow at the earliest.
PUPKIN: Oh, I wouldn't consider it a waste of
CATHY LONG: Look, why don't you try us tomorrow. Tomorrow? . Right. I'll do that. Thanks a lot, Miss Long. And thank CATHY LONG smiles at PUPKIN and goes, leaving PUPKIN staring at a picture of LANGFORD on the wall. WE FIX on LANGFORD a moment and PULL BACK to see LANGFORD in what PUPKIN would imagine his office to be.
PUPKIN: Tomorrow? . Right. I'll do that. Thanks a lot, Miss Long. And thank CATHY LONG smiles at PUPKIN and goes, leaving PUPKIN staring at a picture of LANGFORD on the wall. WE FIX on LANGFORD a moment and PULL BACK to see LANGFORD in what PUPKIN would imagine his office to be.
LANGFORD: Dynamite! This is dynamite!
PUPKIN: ( shyly ) You think so, Jerry?
LANGFORD: Look, I've been at this for fifteen years, Rupert, and I haven't come up with anything like this not me, not any of my writers.
PUPKIN: ( smiling with obvious pleasure ) Well, I'm glad you like it, Jerry.
LANGFORD: Tell me something, Rube. ( pause ) How do you do it? I'm not asking to use the material myself. I just want to know how you ( LANGFORD waves his arms in a gesture of frustration ) how you do it.
PUPKIN: Well, I don't know if I can explain it, really.
LANGFORD: Come on. Try, Rube.
PUPKIN: Well, it just sort of comes. I think about my life, see, mainly about the worst parts, all the awful things, and I just try to see them in a funny light. That's all.
LANGFORD: ( eagerly ) Is that what you do? The worst parts, and then you look at them in a funny light? Is that what you do?
PUPKIN: More or less. It's hard to describe how its happens.
LANGFORD: But that's just it, Rube. It doesn't happen for me. Why do you think the show is in so much trouble? By the time I've done my monologue, everyone has switched to Carson. Maybe if you did a little writing . ?
PUPKIN: Sure, Jerry, I'd do anything I could to help out.
LANGFORD: You would? Great. Why don't you come out to my place this weekend and we'll hash it out. I'm having a few of my friends but we should be able to get a little work in.
PUPKIN: Would you mind if I brought someone?
LANGFORD: ( smiling ) A girl, Rube?
PUPKIN: A very special girl, Jerry.
LANGFORD: I'd love to meet her.
DOORMAN: Cab, Jerry?
LANGFORD: That's alright, thanks. WE FOLLOW LANGFORD as he walks. Some people don't notice. Others stare but leave him alone, a few commenting to their companions and pointing at him. A CAB DRIVER pulls Hey, Jerry. My brother can sing and juggle at the same time. How about puttin' him on your show? LANGFORD keeps walking.
DRIVER: Hey, Jerry. My brother can sing and juggle at the same time. How about puttin' him on your show? LANGFORD keeps walking.
DRIVER: How about it, Jerry?
LANGFORD: Sorry, I'm off duty.
WOMAN: You're Jerry!! LANGFORD pulls his cap a little more tightly around his You know something. ( She giggles ) I undress in front of you every night and Larry here doesn't mind at all.
WOMAN: You know something. ( She giggles ) I undress in front of you every night and Larry here doesn't mind at all.
LARRY: I can't get anything started with her until you're off the air. Your show is ruining my sex life, Jerry.
LANGFORD: Well then, you'll just have to put on a better show than I do.
DAY: WE WATCH LANGFORD continue to walk, feeling what it is to be a celebrity out in public. After a few beats, we
MARSHA: Jerry! God damnit! Just as MARSHA turns around, PUPKIN, unaware of her, walks cheerfully into the building.
RECEPTIONIST: Yes, sir? ( recognizing him ) Oh, hi.
PUPKIN: Hi. How are you?
RECEPTIONIST: Not bad.
PUPKIN: I'm fine.
RECEPTIONIST: Can I help you?
PUPKIN: I'd like to see Jerry, please.
RECEPTIONIST: You are . ?
PUPKIN: Mr. Pupkin.
RECEPTIONIST: Just a minute.
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Pupkin is here . That's right . ( to PUPKIN ) She'll be with you in a minute.
PUPKIN: Miss Long.
RECEPTIONIST: Miss Long.
PUPKIN: But I wanted to see Jerry.
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Langford's not in. Miss Long will take care of you.
PUPKIN: PUPKIN paces for a few beats. He smiles at the RECEPTIONIST. A beat later, CATHY LONG comes out, carrying the tape in its box.
CATHY LONG: Mr. Pupkin?
PUPKIN: How are you today?
CATHY LONG: Fine, Mr. Pupkin. Thank you for your tape. We listened to it with great interest. And, frankly, Mr. Pupkin, we saw a lot of good things in what you're doing. We feel you have good potential. Very good potential.
PUPKIN: ( smiling ) That's why I'll be honest with you, Mr. Pupkin .
CATHY LONG: That's why I'll be honest with you, Mr. Pupkin .
PUPKIN: CATHY LONG
CATHY LONG: We just don't think you're ready yet.
PUPKIN: ( baffled ) Not ready?
CATHY LONG: that you're right for Jerry.
PUPKIN: ( rapidly, half-listening ) Right for Jerry. Sure.
CATHY LONG: one-liners, for instance .
PUPKIN: CATHY LONG
CATHY LONG: is that it?
PUPKIN: is that it?
CATHY LONG: that right way. Thanks. Just tell me the ones you think should go. That would be a big help. ( to the RECEPTIONIST ) This is great. ( to CATHY LONG ) Which ones?
PUPKIN: that right way. Thanks. Just tell me the ones you think should go. That would be a big help. ( to the RECEPTIONIST ) This is great. ( to CATHY LONG ) Which ones?
CATHY LONG: You see, Jerry likes to panel his guests, you know, chat with them got very much to talk about right now.
PUPKIN: CATHY LONG
CATHY LONG: got very much to talk about right now.
PUPKIN: CATHY LONG
CATHY LONG: and to your wife . and to a few friends. But we feel that you should keep developing your act. Test it in some live situations. There are a number of clubs in the city you can
PUPKIN: May I ask you a question, Miss Long?
CATHY LONG: Of course.
PUPKIN: Are you speaking for Jerry?
CATHY LONG: Let's put it this way, Mr. Pupkin. Mr. Langford has complete faith in our judgment.
PUPKIN: I'm sorry to have to say this, Miss Long, and I certainly don't want you to take it personally, but I have to tell you that I don't . I don't have faith in your judgment.
CATHY LONG: Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Pupkin. But I'm afraid there's nothing that can be done about that.
PUPKIN: No . No . I'm afraid I'll have to disagree with you again.
CATHY LONG: ( with strained politeness ) That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin. Now, if you'll excuse me, please, I have some things to do. I'm sorry the news isn't better.
PUPKIN: Miss Long? CATHY LONG turns back.
PUPKIN: When are you expecting Jerry in?
CATHY LONG: He won't be in until very late this That's fine. Thank you. CATHY LONG stares at PUPKIN for a moment, glances at the RECEPTIONIST and then goes. PUPKIN takes a seat in the reception area. He smiles once more at the RECEPTIONIST. The RECEPTIONIST drops her eyes. A few beats go by. CATHY LONG passes by the entranceway and glances at PUPKIN. PUPKIN continues sitting there.
PUPKIN: That's fine. Thank you. CATHY LONG stares at PUPKIN for a moment, glances at the RECEPTIONIST and then goes. PUPKIN takes a seat in the reception area. He smiles once more at the RECEPTIONIST. The RECEPTIONIST drops her eyes. A few beats go by. CATHY LONG passes by the entranceway and glances at PUPKIN. PUPKIN continues sitting there.
RECEPTIONIST: Is there anyone else you would like to see?
PUPKIN: That's alright. I'm happy just A few beats pass in silence.
RECEPTIONIST: Well, would you mind waiting outside, please, Mr. Pupkin? This is a reception area, not a waiting room.
PUPKIN: I understand. PUPKIN remains seated. A few more moments pass. Several OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by the entranceway and glance at PUPKIN. After a few more beats, a large, plainly-dressed MAN in his mid-fifties emerges from the back offices. He goes over to PUPKIN, who stands.
OFFICIAL: Mr. Pupkin? I'm Raymond Wirtz, in charge of security for the Langford WIRTZ puts his arm on PUPKIN's shoulder and, as the following dialogue unfolds leads him out the door, down the corridor and into the elevator.
WIRTZ: Now I think you understand that we have certain rules here that are essential to the smooth functioning of our operation.
PUPKIN: Sure. Sure.
WIRTZ: And that without these rules, we really wouldn't be able to function at our best. You follow my point? PUPKIN nods.
WIRTZ: Now one of these rules is that only authorized personnel and those having official business with our organization are permitted on our premises. And that's why I'm asking you, Mr. Pupkin, to cooperate with us. They have reached the elevator and WIRTZ has pushed the You want me to leave the building.
PUPKIN: You want me to leave the building.
WIRTZ: That's right. It's nothing personal, Mr. Pupkin. Just doing my job. The elevator arrives. WIRTZ signals with his head that PUPKIN should enter. PUPKIN gets in.
WIRTZ: Have a pleasant day.
MARSHA: Well, did you give it to him?
PUPKIN: ( out of a daze ) Did you get my letter to him?
MARSHA: Did you get my letter to him?
PUPKIN: He's not in there.
MARSHA: Look, if you don't want to give it him, okay. I'll get somebody else. But don't try to con me.
PUPKIN: I told you I'd try and I will. I'm going to wait for him right here.
MARSHA: Give me the envelope, huh?
PUPKIN: Sure, but .
MARSHA: I saw him go in myself!
PUPKIN: But they said he wasn't in.
MARSHA: But they said he wasn't in.
PUPKIN: But they said he wasn't in.
MARSHA: Just give me the envelope.
PUPKIN: When did he go in?
MARSHA: Ten minutes ago! That's when.
PUPKIN: You sure?
MARSHA: Look, I saw him my .
PUPKIN: And he hasn't come out?
MARSHA: I've been standing right here. Now how about it? PUPKIN turns and goes back into the building. MARSHA yells after him.
MARSHA: I'm staying right here!
PUPKIN: ( with authority ) Tell Jerry Langford I'm here, please.
RECEPTIONIST: I'm sorry, sir. Mr. Langford's not in.
PUPKIN: I happen to know he
RECEPTIONIST: I'm sorry. He's
PUPKIN: You're putting your job on the line, The RECEPTIONIST starts making a call inside. PUPKIN glances at her and walks right in to the inner corridors. He starts peering into the open doors of the offices that line the corridor. The whole place is like a gigantic maze. OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by him, taking no notice of him. He continues wandering around desperately, completely lost. A few beat later, he spots WIRTZ leading a pair of SECURITY GUARDS. PUPKIN keeps peering into offices quickly as he flees. The GUARDS and WIRTZ finally catch up to PUPKIN at the steno pool and, after a brief chase around the pool, they catch PUPKIN and subdue him. They start dragging him out past the eyes of the OFFICE PERSONNEL.
PUPKIN: ( calling as he is dragged ) Jerry! Jerry! ( to WIRTZ ) You're going the have a hell of a lot of explaining to do! ( calling ) Jerry!
WIRTZ: You had your warning, Mr. Krupkin.
PUPKIN: Jerry! Help me. Jerry!
PUPKIN: ( screaming )
WIRTZ: If we see your face again, Mr. Pupkin, we'll call the police.
PUPKIN: Start looking for a new job! MARSHA comes straight up to PUPKIN who is brushing himself off. His eyes are glazed and distant.
MARSHA: Does he have it?
PUPKIN: Does he have it?
MARSHA: Does he have it?
PUPKIN: ( abstractedly ) Don't worry. I'll get it to him.
MARSHA: Yeah? When? There is a pause.
PUPKIN: This weekend. He asked me to go out there, to his house.
RITA: What are we going to do?
PUPKIN: ( patiently ) Look, I told you, I've got some work to discuss with him. That's all.
RITA: But what about me?
PUPKIN: You're with
RITA: That's fine, but while you two are talking, what am I going to do?
PUPKIN: You can chat with the other guests.
RITA: I'm sure they'll be thrilled hearing about the wonderful world of draft beer. ( pause ) Let's tell 'em I'm a model, If they ask what I do, let's just say I model. You don't mind pretending just a little, do you?
PUPKIN: If they ask what I do, let's just say I model. You don't mind pretending just a little, do you?
RITA: If they ask what I do, let's just say I model. You don't mind pretending just a little, do you?
PUPKIN: If it make you feel better. There is a pause.
RITA: This is a gas! Too bad nobody'll believe it. ( pause ) After you guys are done working, what happens? Are we going out someplace, or what?
PUPKIN: I'm sure Jerry has something arranged.
RITA: What do these people do for fun? Do they party or do freaky things or just get drunk or . I mean, What do they do?
PUPKIN: I guess they just sit around and talk and enjoy each other's company, like anybody else.
RITA: Talk?!? What can you talk about for three or four hours?!
PUPKIN: What do you mean? They've got plenty to talk about. They do things. All kinds of interesting things happen to them and then they talk about them. What do you think Jerry's show is all Yeah, a cocktail party with no drinks. That's what all those shows are. At least they help you get to sleep. There is a pause.
RITA: Yeah, a cocktail party with no drinks. That's what all those shows are. At least they help you get to sleep. There is a pause.
RITA: ( glumly ) Boy, this is going to be some great weekend. I thought we were gonna have some fun.
PUPKIN: ( smiling ) Just take it easy, Rita. Everything's going to be fine.
PUPKIN: Oh, you have no idea how bad it's gotten in New York. Now the muggers are so efficient that, each time they jump you, they take your name and address and put you on a mailing list. ( the COMPANY chuckles ) And once you're on the list, you're in real trouble, like this friend of mine who was mugged thirty-two times on his way home from work. ( a little laughter from the COMPANY ) A SERVANT places the desert, a little, elegant tart, in front of PUPKIN and RITA.
PUPKIN: ( to SERVANT )
PUPKIN: So what my friend does is get himself a dog, one of those huge German Shepherds. One night, he's walking the dog in Central Park when he hears this voice behind him. ( in a German accent ) Okay, Harry, drop your vallet and keep your hantz over your head or I bite your little fanny off. The COMPANY breaks up.
ONE GUEST: ( to LANGFORD ) Looks like you've found yourself a winner, Jerry.
LANGFORD: ( looking at PUPKIN ) He's the one who found himself a winner.
LANGFORD: To Rita and Rupert a short engagement and a long, happy marriage. The COMPANY drinks with murmurs of "Hear! Hear!" RITA and PUPKIN beam. RITA looks lovingly at PUPKIN.
PUPKIN: ( looking pointedly at LANGFORD ) Oh, yes.
PUPKIN: Everyone's invited.
OFFICIAL: We are met here in these extraordinary circumstances to join this man and this woman in holy wedlock. But, before we begin, let me voice a personal word of thanks to you, Rupert and to you, Rita, for choosing me to perform this prestigious ceremony. Because we are on prime time, I am going to discard my customary remarks in favor of a few personal reflections. When I was principal at Clifton High and these two were students, I had very little faith that Rupert here would amount to very much. But like his teachers and his fellow students, I underestimated this fine young man. Some say that this misjudgment is directly tied to my recent dismissal as head of the Clifton School System. But let me take this opportunity to set the record straight. Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were
OFFICIAL: We'll be back to marry them in a minute, right after this word.
CONDUCTOR'S VOICE: Greenwich. Greenwich next stop. PUPKIN and RITA grab their small suitcases and quickly move down the aisle towards the door.
RITA: Look at that one. How'd you like to live in that?!?! Or that one! What do you figure these run? The taxi stops in front of a walled lot behind which is visible a handsome English stucco home.
PUPKIN: ( to DRIVER ) What's this?
DRIVER: This is it.
RITA: It's gorgeous! PUPKIN is genuinely puzzled.
PUPKIN: ( to DRIVER ) You sure?
DRIVER: Look, friend, I wouldn't want to tell you how many times I made this trip. ( pause ) That'll be three PUPKIN, still puzzled, hands him a five dollar bill.
PUPKIN: ( abstractedly ) Keep it.
DRIVER: Thanks. If you need a ride back, just ask the guy for Wayne. That's me. The CAMERA PULLS BACK as PUPKIN opens the gate and he and RITA walk up the drive.
PUPKIN: You must be Jonno. I'm Rupert Pupkin and this is Rita Keane. Mr. Langford's expecting us. Jonno nods politely but uncertainly.
JONNO: ( uncertain ) Mr. Langford asked you to come?
PUPKIN: That's right. Would you mind taking those up? Jerry and I have some work that may oblige me to stay overnight.
JONNO: But Mr. Langford's not here.
PUPKIN: Out playing golf, right?
JONNO: ( still puzzled and unsure ) That's right.
PUPKIN: Maybe he'll finally break a hundred.
JONNO: Maybe it's better if you came back .
PUPKIN: ( interrupting ) That's alright. We don't mind waiting.
RITA: ( worried ) The table's only set for one.
PUPKIN: That's from breakfast. Relax, will JONNO is on the phone. A black lady COOK stands at his Let me talk to Jerry Langford please . I know he is . It's important.
JONNO: ( into the phone ) Let me talk to Jerry Langford please . I know he is . It's important.
PUPKIN: ( as though he owned it ) How do you like it?
RITA: ( admiringly ) I could live here.
PUPKIN: ( smiling proudly ) It's the only way to live. How come he isn't here?
RITA: How come he isn't here?
PUPKIN: You heard the guy. He's out playing Didn't you tell him when we'd get here? PUPKIN continues to move about the room, fielding RITA's suspicious inquiries effortlessly.
RITA: Didn't you tell him when we'd get here? PUPKIN continues to move about the room, fielding RITA's suspicious inquiries effortlessly.
PUPKIN: We didn't have time to iron out the details. Now just relax. We're the first guests, that's all.
RITA: ( interrupting ) That Jonno character hadn't even heard of us!
PUPKIN: ( a little irritated ) It probably slipped Jerry's mind. He has better things to think about than what he tells his houseboy.
RITA: It's just not time way I expected it, that's all. There is a pause. PUPKIN continues his investigation. He has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room.
RITA: What do we do now? PUPKIN is looking at a picture of an American Gothic couple standing in front of a wood-frame house. As he comments on the pictures, the CAMERA PANS over them. They form a kind of slide-show of LANGFORD's life.
PUPKIN: These are Jerry's parents. His father runs the Post office in Wolverine that's in North Dakota. PUPKIN then fixes on a picture of an eleven-year-old boy standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet ( obviously held by the boy ) staring at its master.
PUPKIN: This one was in Newsweek. He started giving these puppet shows when he was still in grade school. WE SEE a picture of a very young LANGFORD seated before a microphone with some celebrity.
PUPKIN: And this is from his quiz show in St. Louis. Can you believe it?
RITA: Sure I can.
PUPKIN: That was the name of the show. WE MOVE to a picture of LANGFORD smiling at JACK PAAR.
PUPKIN: And here's when he wrote for Jack Paar. He made a hundred and fifty a week and look at him now. Another picture of LANGFORD with a group of women sitting in a studio.
PUPKIN: And this is his morning show. A picture of LANGFORD standing in a park with his two boys, eleven and eight.
PUPKIN: And his kids. He's divorced. RITA, who has been only half-listening, has picked up a small, beautifully enameled cigarette box.
RITA: Look at this. I love these kind of things. Look at the work. I've got this thing about boxes. RITA puts it down reluctantly, picks it up, then puts it down again.
JONNO: Mr. Langford? . I'm sorry to disturb you .
RITA: How much longer are we gonna have to wait?
PUPKIN: I don't know. Until he gets back.
PUPKIN: He should be back pretty soon.
RITA: Doesn't he have any music or anything? Let's get a little life into this place. It's like a funeral parlor. She walks over to the stereo and opens the cupboard beneath it, revealing rows and rows of records.
RITA: This is more like it. She pulls out a record.
PUPKIN: Come on, Rita.
RITA: Come on, yourself. She puts the record on. Frank Sinatra starts singing "They Can't Take That Away From Me." She takes a big sip of her drink, puts it down and comes over to PUPKIN.
RITA: How about a little spin, handsome?
PUPKIN: ( pulling back )
RITA: Come on, Rupert. I came up here for a good time. PUPKIN gives in and starts dancing with her in the style of the 1950's, elbow out, arm up, box step. After a few moments, PUPKIN closes his eyes. He has reached a moment of perfect bliss, his dream girl in is arms. They dance silently as we hear Sinatra singing.
SINATRA'S VOICE: The way you wore your hat, The way we danced till three, The memory of all that Oh no, they can't take that away from me, No . they can't take that away . from . me. The orchestra plays.
RITA: You never could dance, could you?
PUPKIN: How would you know?
RITA: Oh I danced with you a couple of times at the Sigma U party.
PUPKIN: You were there with Tommy Winston.
RITA: You didn't ask me.
PUPKIN: That's the one time I and you went with him anyway.
RITA: Well, I couldn't go with
PUPKIN: Why not?
RITA: Be serious, Rupert.
PUPKIN: Well, it's all ended happily and that's what counts. RITA grows jumpy under his gaze. She looks around.
RITA: I wonder what the rest of this place looks like?
PUPKIN: I'm sure it's all very nice.
RITA: ( gaily ) Well, there's only one way to find out. You coming or not?
RITA: You coming or not? RITA bounds up the stairs.
PUPKIN: CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN up the stairs.
PUPKIN: Where are you? There is no answer. CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN from room to room. They are all guest rooms, neat, pretty, clean.
PUPKIN: Come on, Rita. This isn't funny. Finally, PUPKIN opens the door to another room.
PUPKIN: ( shocked ) What are you doing, Rita?
RITA: I love it! All those millions of women out there dying to change places with me right now.
PUPKIN: Come on. We shouldn't be here.
RITA: Relax, will you. Let me have a little fun, for Christ's sake. RITA gets off the bed and runs into the john.
RITA: Look at this. It's nicer than my whole apartment. PUPKIN enters the large, beautifully done bathroom. RITA examines her face in the mirror.
PUPKIN: ( urgently ) Let's go, Rita.
RITA: Boy, I really need some sun.
PUPKIN: Rita, this is Jerry's .
RITA: Lay off, will you, Rupert.
PUPKIN: But we have no right . RITA picks up a can of shave cream and squirts a large dollop in PUPKIN's face. WE COME IN for a CLOSE UP of PUPKIN's face, buried under shaving cream.
PUPKIN: That wasn't funny, Rita. RITA hands him a towel.
RITA: She looks around.
RITA: Now for something that smells nice. She swings open the cabinet with a flourish. The door swings open violently and the mirror shatters against something as pills and bottles tumble into the sink. PUPKIN and RITA stand there, staring at each other. RITA begins to laugh, but her laugh is cut short by the slam of the downstairs door.
LANGFORD: ( looking around ) Where are they?
JONNO: I was going to call the police but then I thought to myself 'what if they are Mr. Langford's friends?' We hear some whispers and scuffling at the top of the stairs. LANGFORD, JONNO and the COOK look up. PUPKIN comes bounding down the stairs jauntily with RITA following cautiously behind. PUPKIN has large traces of shaving cream behind his ears and on his neck.
PUPKIN: Hi, Jerry. We were just freshening up. PUPKIN stops at the base of the stairs, turns around, and waves RITA down.
PUPKIN: ( to RITA ) Come on, Rita. No need to be shy.
PUPKIN: Jerry, I'd like you to meet Rita Keane. Rita, say hello to Jerry!
RITA: ( tentatively ) Pleased to meet you.
PUPKIN: What's your pleasure? PUPKIN glances at the small mess he has left on the bar and turns back to LANGFORD who has moved into the living room with JONNO and the COOK a few steps behind. PUPKIN flashes LANGFORD an apologetic smile.
PUPKIN: ( to LANGFORD ) We've already taken the liberty, so to speak. Rita was a little nervous. It isn't every day she meets someone like you.
LANGFORD: What's going on here?
PUPKIN: We've been sitting around, waiting. That's all. How was your golf game?
JONNO: I told them you weren't here.
COOK: That's right.
PUPKIN: He did, Jerry. He was very helpful. We had to take an early train. There was nothing else until after one. ( pause ) I brought the material. It's upstairs, in my bags. ( pause ) Where is everybody?
LANGFORD: The other guests! ( in a confidential tone ) We're getting a little hungry, to tell you the truth.
PUPKIN: The other guests! ( in a confidential tone ) We're getting a little hungry, to tell you the truth.
LANGFORD: ( as though confirming what PUPKIN said ) You are.
PUPKIN: ( backing off ) But we don't mind waiting, do we,
LANGFORD: You know, I could have you arrested, both of you.
PUPKIN: ( seizing the idea ) You know you could! And there'd be absolutely no way we could prove we belonged here. I never thought of that.
LANGFORD: Well, you
PUPKIN: ( still fixed on the idea ) Maybe we could work up a routine about that, about a guy who throws all his friends in jail. Let's talk about that.
LANGFORD: ( sharply ) Let's not.
PUPKIN: Sure, Jerry. Whatever you .
LANGFORD: ( exasperated ) Look, if you've got something for me to sign, let's have it and get it over with so I can get back .
PUPKIN: ( interrupting ) That wouldn't be right, Jerry. Not in your own house!
LANGFORD: ( summoning his last bit of patience ) I have a lot of work to get to. ( to JONNO ) How did they get here?
PUPKIN: We took a taxi, Jerry . But don't worry about us. You go ahead and do your work and we'll just take a stroll around until lunch is ready.
LANGFORD: You're a little thick, aren't you?
PUPKIN: ( smiling as though complimented ) Well, maybe a .
RITA: What's he's saying, Rupert, is that he wants us out.
PUPKIN: Don't listen to her, Jerry. She doesn't understand anything about us.
RITA: Don't get me into this.
LANGFORD: ( to JONNO ) Call the station.
LANGFORD: There'll be a cab here in a few minutes. Now if you'll just wait at the gate .
PUPKIN: Look, Jerry, if I've said anything out of line, let's chalk it up to inexperience, okay? I'll just go upstairs and get my tape and we can start working. It shouldn't take long and then you'll have the rest of the afternoon to yourself.
LANGFORD: I've told you just as clearly as I can. I want you out of here and I want you out now. Scram, beat it, vamoose, out! Is that plain enough! RITA deftly pockets the enamel box.
PUPKIN: But what about my material? When are we going to go over it?
RITA: Come on, Rupert, the man wants us to go.
PUPKIN: Tell her she's wrong, Jerry!
RITA: Look, Mr. Langford. I didn't know anything about all this. I hardly know this guy. I haven't seen him in years.
PUPKIN: So if there's anything I can do, any way I can make this up to you.
RITA: So if there's anything I can do, any way I can make this up to you.
PUPKIN: She's nothing, Jerry. She's just some girl who works in a bar. Don't let her spoil things. LANGFORD starts herding RITA and PUPKIN towards the door.
LANGFORD: Come on. Let's go.
PUPKIN: All I'm asking is fifteen minutes. That's all. Just long enough to listen to my act. Is that asking too much fifteen minutes of your day against my whole life?
LANGFORD: I'll call the police if I have to. LANGFORD realizes he is being hard. He stops for a moment.
LANGFORD: I have my own life, that's all.
PUPKIN: But what about my life? I made plans based on what you said. You can't just turn your back on me.
LANGFORD: I'm not telling you again. There is a long pause as the truth finally sinks in. PUPKIN just stares at LANGFORD with disbelief that turns to anger.
PUPKIN: So this is the way it works when you're big, huh? You just play with people. Is that part of the kick, Jerry? ( pause ) I can see I was all wrong about you. All wrong. RITA starts tugging at PUPKIN.
RITA: Come on, Rupert.
PUPKIN: ( to RITA ) Shut up! ( to LANGFORD ) You weren't my friend at all, were you? You were just playing some kind of game with me. Well, that's not going to stop me, Jerry. I'm just going to work a little bit harder, that's all, use a little bit more enterprise. And not count on anybody. That's where I made my mistake. I can see that now.
PUPKIN: ( glaring at LANGFORD ) Come on, Rita. We're wasting our time.
RITA: ( baffled and angry ) What did you think was going to happen? You think he'd just . ? What's the matter with you? ( pause ) You can't just walk into a guy's house! And what about me? What did you .
PUPKIN: ( interrupting in a calm but firm voice ) Shut up, Rita. I'm thinking.
MARSHA: ( whining ) How much longer?!?
PUPKIN: Do you want him or not? There is a pause.
MARSHA: You sure he's in there?
PUPKIN: ( with obvious delight ) My parents are going to be furious!
MARSHA: ( with obvious delight ) My parents are going to be furious!
MARSHA: That's the whole point. ( gesturing with his head towards the entrance of the building which is some 50 yards away ) Pay attention. MARSHA looks towards the entrance. A few beats pass.
PUPKIN: That's the whole point. ( gesturing with his head towards the entrance of the building which is some 50 yards away ) Pay attention. MARSHA looks towards the entrance. A few beats pass.
MARSHA: What if he doesn't come down?
PUPKIN: He will.
MARSHA: But what if he doesn't?
PUPKIN: We'll come back tomorrow.
MARSHA: And wait again?
PUPKIN: Look, you're going to have him all to yourself. What else do you want? A MAN resembling LANGFORD walks out the entrance.
PUPKIN: Is that him?!?
MARSHA: You sure?
PUPKIN: You sure?
MARSHA: Sure I'm sure. That looks too much like him.
PUPKIN: What do you mean?
MARSHA: When it's him it doesn't look like him.
PUPKIN: Keep watching. PUPKIN closes his eyes and rests for a moment.
MARSHA: PUPKIN's eyes snap open. WE SEE LANGFORD, concealed in his trench coat, dark glasses and tightly pulled cap start walking
MARSHA: What should I do?
PUPKIN: Wait a second and follow him.
MARSHA: What about here?
PUPKIN: Too busy. Keep going.
PUPKIN: Go past him and stop.
PUPKIN: Just keep walking or I'll kill you right here. LANGFORD looks at PUPKIN in terror. He falters a bit, out of fear.
PUPKIN: I said keep walking. This is a gun in my pocket and I've got nothing to lose.
LANGFORD: ( who keeps walking ) What do you want?
PUPKIN: Just keep walking and don't talk to anybody. I'll tell you what to do. A MAN coming the other way stops and stares at LANGFORD out of curiosity. PUPKIN and LANGFORD keep walking. They get to where the Mercedes is waiting. PUPKIN jabs LANGFORD in the ribs with the gun.
PUPKIN: Get in!
LANGFORD: Look, this is .
PUPKIN: ( interrupting ) Just shut up and get in.
MARSHA: Hi, Jerry. LANGFORD looks over and recognizes MARSHA. A CLOSE UP records his reaction of sheer terror.
PUPKIN: I didn't like being so rough out there, Jerry. But I wanted you to know that I meant business. I didn't want anything happening to you over some misunderstanding. LANGFORD just stares at him, frozen with fear.
PUPKIN: Now I know you're wondering what this is all about. Actually you've got nothing to worry about. You just do what I tell you and by, say, midnight, you'll be safe and out of here. Of course if you try anything clever, I'll kill you or Marsha will. She knows how to use this too.
LANGFORD: You realize what you're saying.
PUPKIN: Come on, Jerry. This isn't a spur
PUPKIN: ( to LANGFORD ) Sit down.
PUPKIN: Now, you're going to call your office and tell them this: that unless a man who identifies himself as the King is allowed on the show tonight as the first guest, they'll never see you alive again.
LANGFORD: I'll say it again .
PUPKIN: I'll say it again .
THOMAS' SECRETARY: Bert Thomas! . He's in a meeting, Mr. Langford . I see.
SECRETARY: He says it's urgent.
THOMAS: ( smiling ) Yeah? Well, tell him I'll call him back. ( to the others ) It's that Martino kid, the impressionist.
PUPKIN: Then try again!
THOMAS: Yeah? . Okay, Martino, let's stop the bullshit . what? . Okay, I'm listening. WE WATCH THOMAS' expression as it turns from skepticism to concern bordering on alarm.
THOMAS: Give me that again? . Wait a minute. What do we call our second The scene is as before, only now LANGFORD is sweating a bit.
LANGFORD: ( into the phone ) Helen Keller.
PUPKIN: ( warning ) No tricks, Jerry.
THOMAS: Don't do anything, Jerry. Stay right there. Tell him we'll do anything he wants. Tell him to cool it. Are you okay? . Look, tell him to call us about five, okay. We'll let him know what to do. And don't do anything THOMAS puts down the phone.
THOMAS: ( calls to his SECRETARY )
THOMAS: Get me the number of the F.B.I. right away. And get me Crockett's office. And keep your mouth shut about this.
MARSHA: ( to PUPKIN ) What do you think?
PUPKIN: Looks fine.
MARSHA: ( to LANGFORD ) I had to guess on the sleeves. ( to PUPKIN ) He gets to keep it, doesn't he?
PUPKIN: Sure, if he isn't dead.
THOMAS: ( panicky ) I know he's in a meeting and I don't care. I've got to talk to him! . No, he can not call me back. Don't you understand? This is an emergency
PUPKIN: This wasn't an easy decision for me, Jerry, believe me. For one thing, I knew it meant we could never be friends again and that hurt me. It's hard to lose a friend, even one who has let you down. You always hope you can patch things up. You know, a guy like me doesn't make friends that easily. PUPKIN pauses a moment, then turns to LANGFORD, his voice filled with emotion.
PUPKIN: Why didn't you just listen to the tape when I asked you? Then I wouldn't have to be doing all this. Was it really too much to expect a few minutes of your time to listen to something I'd worked on my whole LANGFORD's eyes shift rapidly. He is obviously calculating how to deal with PUPKIN.
LANGFORD: ( with disarming charm ) Hey, if that's what's bothering you, let's go over to my office and listen to that tape right now.
PUPKIN: Are you crazy, Jerry? Do you know what would happen to me? MARSHA listens to this exchange a bit nervously. Gesturing to her gun, she says:
MARSHA: Am I going to have to hold this thing all day? PUPKIN sees she has lowered it practically to her side.
PUPKIN: ( to MARSHA ) Just keep it on him. ( to LANGFORD ) You know, Jerry. Friendship is a two- way street. All that time I was worrying about you and your ratings and everything, you couldn't have cared less about me.
LANGFORD: You're right. You know that? I was thoughtless. It's just that when you're doing a big show, it's hard to tell who your friends really are. I was wrong. I apologize. Why don't we just shake hands and forget the whole thing?
PUPKIN: ( suspiciously ) That's easy to say, Jerry.
LANGFORD: But I mean it. I'll tell them that the whole thing was a joke and then we can go to my office and listen to that tape. Come on. What do you say? LANGFORD rises with his hand extended toward PUPKIN.
MARSHA: ( to LANGFORD, sharply ) Sit down!
MARSHA: I said LANGFORD reluctantly sits down.
PUPKIN: ( to MARSHA ) What's the matter? You heard what he said.
MARSHA: All of a sudden, with a gun on him, he wants to make up and be friends. And, once he's out the door, what happens then?
PUPKIN: What happens then, Jerry?
MARSHA: You get to his office and they jump you, that's what happens, Rupert.
PUPKIN: She's right, Jerry.
LANGFORD: Not if I tell them not to. This is Jerry, Rupert, I give you my word.
PUPKIN: ( to MARSHA ) He gives me his word.
MARSHA: Yeah? And what else? Come on, Rupert, I'm sick of waiting.
PUPKIN: And what else, Jerry?
LANGFORD: Come on, Rupert. My word's good enough, isn't it. PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a few beats. Then he shakes his head sadly and says in a very quiet, discouraged voice.
PUPKIN: No, Jerry. It's not. ( to MARSHA ) Keep the gun up! PUPKIN comes over to LANGFORD with a few rolls of adhesive tape in his hand.
PUPKIN: I'm sorry to do it this way, Jerry, but I'm no good at knots. Just put your arms up and out, okay? LANGFORD spreads his arms back against the brass bedstead. As PUPKIN goes to tape them, LANGFORD tries to grab him, but, with sudden, demonic force, PUPKIN pins him against the bedstead. They are practically nose to nose.
PUPKIN: Oh, no, Jerry. None of that. Now hold still.
PATTEN: Look, I tell you, the bureau is doing everything possible to locate Mr. Langford. Right now our men are out checking out every radical group in this city.
AN EXECUTIVE: They're willing to sacrifice their leader in order to get their message across, aren't they? You've got to figure that this is a desperate outfit. I don't know who they are anymore than you do. But I do know I've got to stop them. Otherwise, what you're seeing here is just the first of a whole wave of these kinds of kidnappings.

THOMAS: ( upset ) Does this mean we're not supposed to put him on?!?
PATTEN: Who am I addressing, please?
CROCKETT: That's Bert Thomas. He produces the I'm only saying, Mr. Thomas, that we can't allow this to reach the public. When the kidnappers call in, of course you're going to be cooperative. Promise them anything they want. After all, this King character is going to have to show up sooner or later. And once we get our hands on him, he'll tell us where Mr. Langford PATTEN grinds his fist into his palm.

After all, this King character is going to have to show up sooner or later. And once we get our hands on him, he'll tell us where Mr. Langford PATTEN grinds his fist into his palm.
PATTEN: Sure. Let him go on if you have to. It's just a taping. You can always erase him afterwards, can't you? ( pause ) All I'm saying is this: don't put him on the air.
THOMAS: That's fine, Inspector, but let's say he finishes his bit and you've worked him over .
PATTEN: There is light laughter.
THOMAS: Okay, questioned him and he still won't talk. We get to eleven thirty and what do we do? Do we air him or There is a heavy pause.
PATTEN: I would say no.
THOMAS: But they might kill Jerry!
CROCKETT: ( breaking in ) Okay, Burt. ( to PATTEN ) Thank you, Inspector. We appreciate your position and we'll do all we can to cooperate with you. But I have to tell you right now that, if it comes down to it, we're not taking any chances with Mr. Langford's life.
PATTEN: I understand but .
CROCKETT: ( interrupting ) If your men haven't been able to locate Mr. Langford by air time, we're going to have to put this King guy on, no matter what he's said. After all, Inspector, what's ten or fifteen minutes of talk show time against a man's life?
PUPKIN: Open. ( pause ) Bite . Good. He is wrapping LANGFORD's mouth shut but all we see is that he is doing something.
PUPKIN: Can you breathe? Both ways? In and out? WE PULL BACK TO SEE LANGFORD nodding. He is strapped to the bed with tape and encased like a mummy, only his eyes and nose showing. PUPKIN has wrapped him in tape from tip to toe. MARSHA emerges from the kitchen stirring something.
PUPKIN: ( to MARSHA ) You've got until around midnight. Have a good time. ( to LANGFORD ) So long, Jerry! Wish me luck.
THOMAS' SECRETARY: Bert Thomas! Who's calling please? ( her voice grows tense ) Yes, Mr. King.
PATTEN: ( quietly to THOMAS ) Keep him talking.
THOMAS: Yes? . Yes, Mr, King. We understand. Everything's been arranged. Now if you'll just tell me a little about the nature of your material, so that we can .
PUPKIN: ( into the phone ) I'll tell you everything you need to know at the studio this evening, Mr. Thomas. I appreciate your co- operation. Goodbye.
MARSHA: I've got so much to tell you I just don't know what to begin with. Are you okay? LANGFORD mumbles incoherently through his gag and tape.
MARSHA: Good. Tell me if you're not. I guess you're wondering why I do stuff like this. I think it's because I'm a Leo, but my shrink says I'm pathologically rebellious and self-destructive. You don't think I'm self-destructive, do you? LANGFORD, mummified, again mumbles and struggles a bit in his bonds.
MARSHA: I knew you wouldn't. That's 'cause you're the only person in the world who really understands me.
CROCKETT: Can Randall sub for Jerry? [Tony Randall is one of any number of substitute hosts.]
THOMAS: His agent's calling us back but it looks good. I only told him Jerry's sick.
CROCKETT: Well, if worse comes to worse, Canter can always carry it. ( to CATHY LONG ) Let me see your list. CATHY LONG hands CROCKETT a blue piece of paper. He glances over it quickly.
CROCKETT: Any one of these a writer?
THOMAS: ( pointing to a name on the list ) McCabe. The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.
CROCKETT: He's out.
CATHY LONG: What if we don't run this King guy? Who'll fill the time?
CROCKETT: We'll stretch the other guests. But I think we're going to wind up running him. For one thing, we've got to think about Jerry.
FIRST EXECUTIVE: And from a news point of view, we've got a responsibility to air this story.
CROCKETT: Exactly, Lou. ( pause ) I mean, who would you rather watch some tiger expert or a live kidnapper.
CROCKETT: Then they'll read about it in the papers tomorrow and, believe me, tomorrow night, everyone in America will be watching
THOMAS: You're going to put him on twice?
SECOND EXECUTIVE: And remember what Patten said about .
CROCKETT: Hold on. ( pause ) We can always edit the guy. And, as for a wave of these things, I just don't buy the idea that there are that many people out there crazy enough to spend their lives in prison for a few minutes on television.
MCCABE: ( a bit pompously ) Good evening, officer. This is the backstage door I take it?
GUARD: Your name please?
MCCABE: Clarence McCabe, the writer. And this is Mrs. McCabe and her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Leroy Solters of Cleveland.
GUARD: ( checking his list ) I'm sorry, sir. I don't see you here.
MCCABE: I'm on the show tonight, officer.
GUARD: Well, you're not here.
MCCABE: ( getting a bit agitated ) Look, Cathy Long gave me instructions to present myself at a quarter to six. May I see her please?
GUARD: I'm under strictest orders tonight to admit only authorized personnel.
MCCABE: ( huffy ) This is absurd. ( to the others ) Wait right here.
GUARD: Stop him!
MCCABE: CUT TO:
PATTEN: Are you the King? MCCABE looks baffled.
PUPKIN: ( getting CAMERAMAN's attention ) Excuse me.
PUPKIN: I'm the King.
CAMERAMAN: CUT TO:
PATTEN: Don't talk to me about tigers!
PUPKIN: ( to STAGE MANAGER ) I'm the King.
STAGE MANAGER: ( smiling ) What can I do for you, your highness?
CATHY LONG: What are you doing here, Mr. Pupkin?!?!
MARSHA: ( singing to the music ) "I'm gonna love you, Like no one's ever loved you, Come rain or come shine, Happy together, unhappy together, And won't it be fine."
PATTEN: ( to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN ) I hope you brought me the right guy this time. ( to PUPKIN ) Where's Jerry ( to GIARDELLO ) Are you on the show?
PUPKIN: ( to GIARDELLO ) Are you on the show?
PATTEN: No, Mr. King. That's my assistant, Mr. Giardello.
PUPKIN: I want to see someone on the show.
PATTEN: Well, you tell us where Mr. Langford is and we'll let you see anyone you Just get me someone from the show. PATTEN starts browsing through the autograph book.
PUPKIN: Just get me someone from the show. PATTEN starts browsing through the autograph book.
PATTEN: Come on, Mr. King. Let's not fool around. ( looking up from the book ) Should we know about any of these That's Orson Bean.
PUPKIN: ( gesturing to the book ) That's Orson Bean.
PATTEN: I see. ( to GIARDELLO ) Check these Now are you going to talk to us, or not?
PATTEN: Now are you going to talk to us, or not?
PUPKIN: Sure I'll talk. Just get me someone from the show.
PATTEN: ( to GIARDELLO ) Get that Thomas guy in here.
PATTEN: We haven't much time, Mr. King. PUPKIN looks towards the door.
PATTEN: Let's start with your name.
PUPKIN: Rupert Pupkin.
PATTEN: That's your real name?
PUPKIN: Yes sir.
PATTEN: You an American?
PUPKIN: Then why do you people do these things? THOMAS enters. He scrutinizes PUPKIN.
PATTEN: Then why do you people do these things? THOMAS enters. He scrutinizes PUPKIN.
PUPKIN: Are you on the show?
THOMAS: Yes. I'm Bert Thomas. PUPKIN pulls thin piece of neatly typewritten paper from his inside jacket and hands it to THOMAS.
PUPKIN: Here's the introduction to my act. Please make sure Mr. Randall follows it exactly as I've written it.
PATTEN: Okay. How about helping us, Mr. King?
PUPKIN: What about make-up? I need make-up.
PATTEN: ( to PLAINCLOTHESMEN ) Put some color in his cheeks.
MARSHA: ( crying ) It was the second lead! I'd never gotten a part in my life and here I get the second lead. And what does Daddy say?
MARSHA: Not "Marsha, that's wonderful" or "we're proud of you" or anything. Oh no. He starts lecturing me on how I should have tried out for Emily! Now do you understand, Jerry! MARSHA gets hold of herself. She swallows a couple of pills and swills them down with some wine.
MARSHA: ( calmer ) My doctor says I shouldn't get excited.
MARSHA: This is the best I ever made it. You want some? LANGFORD, the mummy, nods. MARSHA picks up the plate across from her, fills it with food, and pulls a chair up next to LANGFORD. She undoes the tape around his mouth and picks a sock out of his mouth.
MARSHA: Now open. Marsha's going to feed her Two young GIRLS are working on big cue cards copying from the piece of paper PUPKIN has given THOMAS. TONY RANDALL stands next to THOMAS. The two of them watch. RANDALL is going over the lines.
PATTEN: How about it, King?
PUPKIN: If I'm not on that show, Jerry Langford is dead, I promise you. PATTEN nods to his PLAINCLOTHESMEN again who start working PUPKIN over.
TECHNICIAN: Hold on two. Hold. Hold. Come on, Keller. Get it framed!
CANTER: Now! Direct from New York! It's the Jerry Langford Show with guest host Tony Randall and his special guests Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz, pundit Gore Vidal, the one and only Zsa Zsa Gabor and another of Jerry's taped exclusives, an interview with Prince Ranier of Monaco. As always, Rick Ross and the Orchestra and me, Bert Canter. And now . say hello to An APPLAUSE sign flashes like crazy. The AUDIENCE cheers wildly. In the back, we notice a handful of TACTICAL PATROLMEN scattered about. RANDALL strides on stage briskly, accepting the cheers of the crowd with his arms raised. He nods and then his eyes fix on those hastily written outsized cue cards. He reads them with a mixture of professionalism and wry distance, wanting to disown the words without seeming silly.
RANDALL: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you very much. I have some sad news for you. Earlier today, my writing staff was executed in Central Park by the network firing squad so there'll be no sensational Randall monologue this evening. The AUDIENCE cheers derisively.
RANDALL: No embarrassing displays of emotion, please. ( the AUDIENCE laughs ) Instead, we're going to do something a little bit different this evening a lot different if you ask me. We're going to give you a glimpse into the future. It isn't often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business. After all, the verdict is always in your hands. But I think tonight, after you've met my first guest, you'll agree with me that he's destined for greatness in one way or another. So will you please give your warmest greeting to the newest King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!! The music plays. The APPLAUSE sign flashes. The AUDIENCE applauds heartily and nobody appears to fill the spotlight at the edge of the wings. The spotlight holds
TECHNICIAN: Just hold. Three. Pick up the Finally after what seems like an eternity, PUPKIN emerges, straightening his jacket a bit and trying to crane the kinks out of his neck. He is a bit tense but very high and in full command. As he delivers his monologue, PUPKIN is more confident, comfortable and self-assured than we have ever seen him.
PUPKIN: Good evening, ladies and gentleman. Let me introduce myself. My name is Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton, New Jersey, which was not, at that time, a federal offense. ( laughter ) Is there anyone here from Clifton? ( silence ) Good. We can all relax. Now, I'd like to begin by saying that my parents were too poor to afford me a childhood but the fact is nobody is allowed to be really poor in Clifton. Once you fall below eleven thousand you're exiled to Passaic. My parents did, in fact, put down the first two payments on my childhood. Then they tried to return me to the hospital as defective. But, like everyone else I grew up in large part thanks to my mother. If she was only here today I'd say, "Hey, mom. What are you doing here? You've been dead for nine years?" ( laughter ) You should have seen my mother. She was wonderful blonde, beautiful, intelligent, alcoholic. ( laughter ) We used to drink milk together after school. Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded. ( laughter ) Once she was picked up for speeding. They clocked her doing fifty in our garage. ( laughter ) When they tested her they found that her alcohol was two per cent blood. They took away her license and she died shortly afterwards. We used to joke together Mom and me, until the tears would stream down her face and she'd
LANGFORD: That was a wonderful dinner, Marsha. I want you to know how much I enjoyed We can do it again.
MARSHA: We can do it again.
LANGFORD: I'd like to show you my gratitude. But it's a little difficult, like this. LANGFORD indicates his bonds.
PUPKIN: A lot of you are probably wondering why Jerry couldn't make it this evening. Well, he's tied up and I'm the one who tied him. ( laughter ) You think I'm joking, but that's the only way I could break into show business by hijacking Jerry Langford. ( laughter ) I'm not kidding. Right now, Jerry Langford is strapped to a bedstead somewhere in the middle of this city. ( laughter ) Go ahead. Laugh. But the fact is . I'm here. Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding and you'll think I was crazy. But I figured it this way: better to be King for a Night than Schmuck for a Lifetime!!! ( laughter ) Good night ladies and gentlemen. God bless you. The AUDIENCE applauds heartily. The music plays. And TONY RANDALL salutes PUPKIN with a wave of his hand. PUPKIN goes off stage after soaking up the applause.
MAE: ( to PUPKIN ) Who did you get?
MAE: ( to PLAINCLOTHESMAN ) Could I have a ride? I've never been in one.
MAE: I've never been in one. The limo pulls away.
PATTEN: Okay, Pupkin. We'll start all over again. Where is Langford? You know, we're going to find him sooner or later.
PUPKIN: I'm trying to tell you, Inspector. You let me walk out of here, right? And as soon as I'm seen my act on the show as soon as I'm sure they've really put it on I'll tell you where Jerry is and you'll get him back safe and sound.
PATTEN: Fine, Pupkin. Then why don't you watch the show here with us? That way we're all happy. ( to GIARDELLO ) What channel?
GIARDELLO: We get that one in fine. So what do you say, Pupkin?
PATTEN: We get that one in fine. So what do you say, Pupkin?
PUPKIN: Look, I'll say it again. You let me go now. PATTEN motions to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN wearily with his head. They drag PUPKIN off. PATTEN looks up at the clock.
LANGFORD: Watch my hair!
MARSHA: I'm sorry, baby. We hear the sound of tape ripping.
LANGFORD: I'm sorry.
MARSHA: I'm sorry.
A PLAINCLOTHESMAN: Still nothing. PUPKIN glances at the clock. It is 11:05.
PUPKIN: I've got to get out of here.
PATTEN: You're not going anywhere, Pupkin. Now, where is he?
PUPKIN: I'm telling you, Inspector, if I don't see that show where I want to see it, Jerry Langford is dead. My people have instructions to execute him unless they hear from me by midnight.
PATTEN: Just where is it you want to watch this show?
LANGFORD: Ow! God damnit! Not so fast!
MARSHA: ( working frantically ) We haven't all night, baby.
LANGFORD: Oh, I love you, baby. I love you so much.
OW!!!!: Oh, I love you, baby. I love you so much.
MARSHA: Oh, I love you, baby. I love you so much.
PATTEN: Here we, are, Pupkin. I don't know what this is all about, but as soon as you've seen yourself, you're going to talk to us or I promise you, you'll never see daylight again.
PUPKIN: I'll need a couple of minutes, Inspector.
PATTEN: After it's over, I want a couple of minutes. And I'll need ten dollars. Does anyone of you gentlemen have my Don't push me, Pupkin.
PUPKIN: After it's over, I want a couple of minutes. And I'll need ten dollars. Does anyone of you gentlemen have my Don't push me, Pupkin.
PATTEN: Don't push me, Pupkin.
PUPKIN: A condemned man's last request, Well, I'll tell you right away, the answer is no, Pupkin.
PATTEN: Well, I'll tell you right away, the answer is no, Pupkin.
PUPKIN: It's not much of a ransom, Inspector .
PATTEN: ( losing his temper ) Look, I'm drawing the line, that's all! No ten dollars and that's it. ( emphatically ) No ten dollars!!!! You understand?!?
PUPKIN: ( in mollifying tones ) Sure. Sure, Inspector. No ten dollars .
PATTEN: ( appeased ) . and no Jerry Langford.
PUPKIN: . and no Jerry Langford. There is a pause as PATTEN stifles himself.
PUPKIN: Come on, it's getting late, Inspector.
PATTEN: ( exploding to one of his MEN ) Go ahead. Give him his goddamned ten dollars! Give him twenty! I don't care. Just get him out of here!
PUPKIN: ( urgently to RITA ) Turn on Langford. Seven.
MOUSY MAN: Hey! I'm watching RITA keeps staring at PUPKIN.
PUPKIN: Just turn it. Come on.
MOUSY MAN: I was here first, mister. You can't just walk in like this. It isn't RITA glances at the MAN. PUPKIN can't wait. He vaults onto the bar and turns the set to the Langford Show, just as, on screen, he walks from the wings onto the stage to the applause of the studio audience. Perched atop the bar, standing next to the image of himself, PUPKIN looks down at RITA, a smile of pride and triumph on his face.
MARSHA: Oh, baby. Baby. LANGFORD frees his ankles of tape just in time to side-step MARSHA and moves quickly to the dining room table where he grabs the gun. He trains it on her.
LANGFORD: MARSHA moves toward him. He pulls the trigger, releasing a plastic pellet that hits MARSHA in the stomach, stinging her.
MARSHA: LANGFORD glances down in horror at the gun which he now realizes is a toy and looks up in horror to see MARSHA, bigger than life, bearing down on him.
MARSHA: Don't be afraid of Marsha, baby.
SECOND FRIEND: HALF-STEWED WOMAN It's a trick, that's What about your all. Larry can do it brother? as good as him.
PUPKIN: Come on, Rita. Don't spoil the party. ( to the CUSTOMERS ) Drinks all around on me.
PUPKIN: ( to the two FRIENDS ) What'll you have?
FIRST FRIEND: I'm okay. Thanks, pal.
SECOND FRIEND: Me, too. The MOUSY MAN has climbed up on the bar and has turned the TV back to the late movie. He sits enthralled by a scene
PUPKIN: I don't suppose you're allowed anything. ( to RITA ) I guess nobody's in a celebrating mood. How about you? You want something?
FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN: It's getting time, Pupkin.
PUPKIN: In a second.
RITA: ( in a sad, serious voice to PUPKIN ) That was true, wasn't it? . about the kidnapping.
PUPKIN: Now you can say you knew me. That's something, anyway.
FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN: Come on, Pupkin.
PUPKIN: ( to RITA, in a quiet, tender voice ) I guess I've got go. Take care of yourself, will you. And when you're bored you know, when you're brushing your teeth or something, give me a thought, okay?
RITA: The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN out of the bar. The two FRIENDS are still buried in their intense, private conversation. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN walk past the HALF-STEWED COUPLE.
SECOND PLAINCLOTHESMAN: Yeah, Pupkin. You threw it all away.
PUPKIN: ( vaguely ) We'll see.
CANTER: And now! Direct from New York! The Jerry Langford Show, starring Jerry's special guest, out on bail, Rupert Pupkin, the kidnapping King of Comedy!!!! The AUDIENCE applauds mightily and the FINAL CREDITS roll. As they roll, the music to the Langford Show continues and WE WATCH a MONTAGE that shows PUPKIN progressively taping LANGFORD to the back of a brass bedstead on stage as the two of them talk and laugh. By the end of the MONTAGE, LANGFORD is once again mummified and PUPKIN, having finished, bows and smiles. WE CLOSE on a FREEZE-FRAME CLOSE UP of PUPKIN in ecstasy.
