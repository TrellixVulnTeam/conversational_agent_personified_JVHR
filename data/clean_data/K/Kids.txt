STEVEN: Steven and all the guys run up and surround the hoodlum. They all start screaming taunts. "Fuck 'em up Casper!" Casper is inches from the hoodlum. They are both in a fighting stance. Casper keeps pulling his pants up. Casper has a huge smile on his face, like this is his favorite thing in the whole world.
CASPER: They are both right about to swing. Everyone in the whole park has turned their attention to the scuffle. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Harold runs up behind the Hoodlum and with the truck of his skateboard, smashes the guy in the back of the head. A huge thud is heard and the hoodlum just kinda falls forward on his knees. Casper, with a big smile, steps back and kicks the guy in the face as hard as he can. Everyone gets in a big circle around the fallen hoodlum. They're all screaming. Even the girls are screaming. "Fuck 'em up!" Harold continues hitting the hoodlum with his skateboard. Hitting him on the legs and stomach. Casper is jumping up and down on the hoodlum's head.

CASPER: Suck my dick! Suck my dick! Suck my dick! All of a sudden, all the skateboarders in the park, including Hamilton and Steven, take their boards and start smashing this guy, over and over. The hoodlum is on the ground holding his head, as everyone frantically tries to kill him. The focus should be on the face of the skateboarders. How much they are enjoying this. They continue to pound him, over and over, like animals in on the prey. This should look very scary, as twenty guys try to kill the fallen hoodlum. Even little kids are in the middle, beating the guy. Telly looks up to the sky. He makes a loud noise as he clears his throat, like he's gathering mucus. Then he puts his arms down and stops some of the kids from hitting the hoodlum. His face is completely cracked and bloody. Telly steps over him and spits a huge phlegm wad onto his face. Casper, still smiling, kicks the guy in the face.
CASPER: Everyone stops kicking the guy and they all get kinda silent and look at him. He looks completely twisted, bloody, and dead. Casper bends over, right in his face.
CASPER: Now get in my way! Bitch.

SECURITY GUARD: Jennie smiles and walks by. Nasa is like a giant warehouse. It has hallways and rooms. Kids invade every inch of the club. As Jennie walks in, the Techno music grows very loud. The music should sound as if you were stuck in a fast-paced video game. Kids are running around everywhere. The CAMERA follows Jennie through the club as if it is seeing everything Jennie sees. The dance floor is packed with kids holding flashlights and sucking on pacifiers. As she walks through the darkened hallways, people are against the walls making out.

TELLY: Jennie slams the door shut. Telly continues having sex with Darcy.
CASPER: Lucky fuckin bastard. Casper shuts the door. He walks back through the hallway and into the living room. When he gets in the living room, he looks around, then he flops down beside Jennie on the couch. He puts his hands down his pants and starts itching. Casper looks beside his feet and sees Steven sleeping with his head on top of Kim's stomach. Casper continues to scratch his balls. Then he looks over beside him at Jennie scrunched up asleep. Casper looks around to see if anyone is awake in the room. Everybody is asleep. He scoots up close to Jennie and looks at her. Casper nudges her shoulder.
CASPER: Jennie. Jennie. Jennie does not respond. As Casper takes his hand off her shoulder, he gently rubs her breasts. He moves his hand down her stomach and gently between her thighs. He caresses her. She does not feel anything. Casper bends over and puts his face by her ear.
CASPER: Jennie. Please wake up. It's me Casper. Jennie. She does not respond. Casper starts kissing Jennie's ear. She swats her shoulder. Casper gets up and looks at her. He stares at her stomach and crotch. He puts his hands on her jeans and then he undoes her belt. He is very careful not to make any abrupt movements. As he unclips her jeans he watches her face to see if there is any kind of response.
CASPER: Jennie. Don't worry. It's me Casper. He slowly pulls her pants down. She is wearing teddy bear underwear. Casper throws her pants to the ground and then he looks at her legs. With his fingertips he starts caressing her soft skin. Then he gets off the couch and onto his knees. He puts one leg on his shoulder and the other on the couch. He looks at her and then pulls her panties off. Casper quickly undoes his pants and gets in betwen her legs. He puts her hands around his shoulders. Jennie is sort of coming to but she has no energy. She makes some noise but she is passed out and powerless. Her eyes are closed the whole time. She is not aware of what is happening.
JENNIE: Don't. Please don't. No. No. Casper starts situating himself. She is totally limp.
CASPER: Casper has his knees on the floor as he takes advantage of Jennie. Jennie moves her arms a little bit. Casper is breathing fast and heavy.
