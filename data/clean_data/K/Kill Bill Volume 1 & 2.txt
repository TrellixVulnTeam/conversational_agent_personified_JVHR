LITTLE GIRL: Barney did this?
THE HOUSEWIFE: This is a old friend of mommy's I ain't seen in a long time.

THE HOUSEWIFE: Want some coffee?
THE BRIDE: Yeah, sure.
THE HOUSEWIFE: Cream and sugar?
THE BRIDE: Both, please.
THE BRIDE: Were you expecting me?
VERNITA: Yes and no. Bill got in touch with me right after you woke up, and then again a little later after your episode in Japan. So I suppose it's a little late for a apology, huh?
THE BRIDE: You suppose correctly.
VERNITA: Even if I was sincere?
THE BRIDE: Oh. I'm quite positive you're sorry, now.
VERNITA: Look bitch, I need to know if you're gonna start anymore shit around my baby girl!
THE BRIDE: You can relax for now. I'm not going to murder you in front of your daughter.
VERNITA: That's being more rational than Bill led me to believe you were capable of.
THE BRIDE: Well that's a demonstration of Bill's complete ignorance when it comes to the subject of me, and what I'm thinking, and what I might do. It's mercy, compassion, and forgiveness I lack, not
THE BRIDE: I'll wait for now, but I won't wait for long. I'll allow you to choose a time and place for us to meet again, preferably as far away from Nikki as possible. I could have just HIT you, I didn't, I demand respect for that. Since this is not a HIT, consider it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly Vipers, we will observe Viper rules of honor. One on one - no help - no bushwhackin - no treacherous weapons - on weapon of choice - our skill and our bodies.
VERNITA: ( BLEEP ) - I'm not through telling you. Failure to keep our date, or duplicity of any kind, will result in me putting a xoxo hollow point bullet into the back of your skull from a window of a building across the street from Nikki's elementary school. Now, feel free to respond.
THE BRIDE: - I'm not through telling you. Failure to keep our date, or duplicity of any kind, will result in me putting a xoxo hollow point bullet into the back of your skull from a window of a building across the street from Nikki's elementary school. Now, feel free to respond.
VERNITA: Look.I know I fucked you over. I fucked you over bad. I wish to God I hadn't, but I did.
VERNITA: If I could go back in a machine I would, but I can't. All I can tell you is I'm a different person now.
THE BRIDE: I don't care.
VERNITA: Be that as it may, I know I do not deserve mercy or forgiveness. However, I beseech you for both on behalf of my daughter.
THE BRIDE: Bitch, you can stop right there.
THE BRIDE: ( leans in close ) Just because I have no wish to murder you before the eyes of your daughter, does not mean parading her around in front of me is going to inspire sympathy. You and I have unfinished business.
VERNITA: You have every right to wanna get Vernita. I don't want to get even. To get even, even Steven. I would have to kill you, go into Nikki's room, kill her, then wait for your old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and kill him. That would make us even. No, my unborn daughter will just hafta be satisfied with your death at her mother's hands.
THE BRIDE: But that's where you're wrong, Vernita. I don't want to get even. To get even, even Steven. I would have to kill you, go into Nikki's room, kill her, then wait for your old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and kill him. That would make us even. No, my unborn daughter will just hafta be satisfied with your death at her mother's hands.
VERNITA: When do we do this?
THE BRIDE: It all depends. When do you want to die? Tomorrow? The day after tomorrow? That's about as long as I'll wait.
VERNITA: How bout tonight, bitch?
THE BRIDE: Spendid. Where?
VERNITA: There's a baseball diamond where our little league has its games, about a mile from here. We meet there around two-thirty in the morning, dressed all in black, your hair in a black stocking, and we have us a knife fight, we won't be

THE BRIDE: Weapon of choice? And if you want to stick with your butcher knife, I'm cool with that.
VERNITA: Very funny.
VERNITA: Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please Do to your daughter, what you did to mine. .I won't.
THE BRIDE: Do to your daughter, what you did to mine. .I won't.
THE BRIDE: It was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that I'm sorry. But you can take my word for it, your mother had it coming. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting.

BILL: Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer.
BILL: I came to play.
BILL: ( as he inspects dice ) I'm not implying anything.
ALBURT: That did it fuckhead, you're out the door
BILL: You looked me over when I stood in your doorway. I'm looking you over as I step up to your table. If I don't know, I don't throw.
BILL: More or less.
BILL: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were trying to take my money, and I was trying to take yours.
BILL: If you're game, take my bet

BILL: the bar a half can of warm piss, at twenty bucks a shot. How much did the six-pack cost you? 5.60, 5.65? You're greedy O'Boyle. You're just too Goddamn greedy. You know what I like to do when I meet greedy people? Take every fuckin thing they got. Leave em with nothing.
BILL: through with you, you won't have a pot to piss, or a window to throw it out of. You'll thumb a ride out of L.A. wearing a barrel.
BILL: The embarrassing truth that you run a gutless game. I won't forget it. I'm sure these gentlemen won't forget it. I'm sure they'll tell people who won't forget it. And we won't come back. If we don't come back, you won't get our money. Couple of weeks, you won't have a the idea of taking everything you've won away, and sending you out the door with nothing but a red face, is so appealing to me, that I will take your bet. But...not with those dice.
BILL: Oooohhh, that's..
BILL: Yes I would...Shoot it all...Against myself.
BILL: Did I stutter, I'm changing my bet. I'm betting I don't make it.
ALBURT: You can't do that.

BLACK FRAME: TITLE CARD:
BUDD: Great day in the morning. Brother Bill livin up to his familia How ya doin' Budd?
BILL: How ya doin' Budd?
BUDD: Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a mad rush of wild parties and wealthy women.
BUDD: Is that that tall blonde one-eyed Viking bitch in the passenger seat?
BILL: It's Elle. Want to say hello?
BUDD: Never said "bye," can't seem to think of a reason to say, "hi."
BUDD: What'd ya wanna talk about?
BILL: Are you not going to invite me in?
BUDD: May I ask why not?
BILL: May I ask why not?
BUDD: It stinks in there, that's why. Now what's so important it requires a
TIME CUT: The estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand. Bill stands.
BUDD: You tryin to tell me she cut her way through eighty-eight bodyguards 'fore she got to O-Ren?
BILL: No. There wasn't really eighty eight of them, they just called themselves The Crazy 88.
BUDD: I dunno, I guess they thought it sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about 26 or 27 around her when ( BLEEP ) attacked. They all fell under her Hanzo sword.
BILL: I dunno, I guess they thought it sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about 26 or 27 around her when ( BLEEP ) attacked. They all fell under her Hanzo sword.
BUDD: She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword?
BILL: She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.
BUDD: He made her one? Didn't he swear a blood oath never to make another It would appear he's broken it.
BILL: It would appear he's broken it.
BUDD: Them Japs know how to carry a grudge don't they? Or is it just you tend to bring that out in I know this is a ridiculous question before I ask, but you by any chance haven't kept up with your swordplay?
BILL: ( pause ) I know this is a ridiculous question before I ask, but you by any chance haven't kept up with your swordplay?
BUDD: Hell, I pawned that years ago.
BILL: You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword?
BUDD: The disrespect is pain.
BILL: It was priceless.
BUDD: Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso I got me 250 Dollars for it.
BILL: Since it was a gift from me, why didn't you offer me the chance to buy it back?
BUDD: Because that would've required me to acknowledge your existence. Drunken bum though I may be, I don't need booze that bad. But who the hell gives a crap anyway. That bitch ain't gittin no Bushido points for killin a white trash piece of shit like me with a samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill. If she wants to fight me, all she gotta do is come down to the Club, start some shit, and we'll be in a a fight.
BILL: Budd, you need to listen to me. I know we haven't spoken for quite some time, and the last time we spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But you need to get over being mad at me, and start becoming afraid of Bea. Because she is coming, and she's coming to kill you. And unless you accept my assistance, I have no doubt she will succeed.
BILL: Can't we forget the past, and look at the happy side of all this?
BUDD: And what would that happy side be?
BILL: She's brought "the boys" back
BUDD: I appreciate the concern on your face, but there's a difference 'tween "the boys", time can't erase. I don't dodge guilt. And I don't Jew outta payin my comeuppance. That woman deserves her revenge. And we deserve to die. But then again, so does she. So I guess we'll just see now, won't we.
TED: You're late, Budd, this shit ain't school, ya know.
STRIPPER: Hey, Budd.
BUDD: Hey, Lucky. Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at it again. There's shitty water all over the floor.
STRIPPER: Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at it again. There's shitty water all over the floor.

ELLE: Did you kill her?
BUDD: Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do it easy enough. She's so gentle right now, I could preform her coup de grace with a rock.
ELLE: What are you waiting for, run outta liquid courage.
BUDD: No. It's just.I ain't killed nobody in a long Goddamn time. And just 'tween you, me, and Jesus Christ, kinda made me a promise I wasn't gonna. Be that however it is. Back when I did kill people.I got paid for it. Just don't seem right.turn amateur this time of

BLACK FRAME: TITLE APPEARS:
THE BRIDE: Did he teach you that?
BILL: No. He teaches no one the ten-point palm - exploding heart technique. But he is Nietzsche's psalm personified. If Pai Mei doesn't kill you, he will make you stronger. Now one of the things I always liked about you, Kiddo, is you appear wise beyond your years. Then allow me to impart, a word to the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER - Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash him - even for an instant - a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out. And if you throw any American sass his way, he will snap your back and your neck like they were twigs, and that will be the story of you.
BILL: He'll accept you as his student.
THE BRIDE: Caught him in a good mood, aye?
BILL: More like a sadistic one.
BILL: Just seeing those steps again makes me ache. You're gonna have plenty of fun carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker.
THE BRIDE: Why did he accept me?
BILL: Because he's a very very very old man. And like all rotten bastards, when they get old, they become lonely. Not that that has any effect on their disposition. But they do learn the value of company.
THE BRIDE: When will I see you again?
BILL: That's the title of my favorite soul song of the Seventies.
THE BRIDE: Nothing. When he tells me you're When do you think that might be?
BILL: Nothing. When he tells me you're When do you think that might be?
THE BRIDE: When do you think that might be?
BILL: That my dearest, all depends on you. Now remember, no backtalk, no Least not for the first year. You're going to have to let him warm up for you. He hates Caucasians, despises Americans, and has nothing but contempt for women, so in your case, that may take a little while. Adios.
THE BRIDE: ( yelling )
THE BRIDE: ( to herself ) More stairs, Jesus Christ.
THE BRIDE: Teacher, I am unworthy to be your
THE BRIDE: I speak Japanese very well
THE BRIDE: A little, I am still learning.
PAI MEI: Bill is your master, is he not?
THE BRIDE: Yes, he is.
PAI MEI: Your master tells me you're not entirely unschooled. What training do you possess?
THE BRIDE: I am proficient in a combination of Tiger and Crane style. And I am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the Samurai Sword.
PAI MEI: ( he makes a SNORTING
SOUND ): The exquisite art of the samurai sword. Don't make me laugh. Your so called exquisite art, is only fit for Japanese fat heads. You really are a silly ass.
PAI MEI: Impudent dog! You dare glare at me!
THE BRIDE: I'm sorry master
PAI MEI: Silence! I do not wish to hear your unintelligible excuses. Your anger amuses me. Do you believe you are my match?
PAI MEI: Your anger amuses me. Do you believe you are my match?
THE BRIDE: PAI MEI
PAI MEI: Are you aware I kill at will?
THE BRIDE: PAI MEI
PAI MEI: Is it your wish to die?
THE BRIDE: PAI MEI
PAI MEI: Then you must be stupid. Rise stupid, and let me get a better
PAI MEI: You breathe hard. The one hundred steps robbed you of your wind. So your stupidity is matched only by your weakness. Is there anything you do well? Oh yes, you speak Japanese. I despise the Goddamn Japs. I would of thought an American would be immune to their pompous posturing. Apparently I was wrong. Go to that drawer. Remove the sword.
PAI MEI: Remove the sword.
PAI MEI: Come now woman, can't you even hit an old man?
PAI MEI: Your ability really is quite poor.
PAI MEI: Ha ha ha ha ha! I've fought cripples who posed more of a challenge. Now fight, goddamn you!
PAI MEI: From here you can get an excellent view of my foot.
PAI MEI: Give up? Or care to try again?
PAI MEI: That blade's sharp. Careful not to cut off your own arm.
PAI MEI: If you can't fight any better than that, what use do you have for a

PAI MEI: Like all yankee women, the only thing you know how to do is order
PAI MEI: Excruciating isn't it? I asked you a question!
THE BRIDE: PAI MEI
PAI MEI: I could chop off your arm at will. I think I shall.
THE BRIDE: No please don't!
PAI MEI: If you wish to speak romantic languages, you've come to the wrong Please don't cut my arm off!
THE BRIDE: Please don't cut my arm off!
PAI MEI: It's my arm now. I can do with it what I please. If you can stop me, I suggest you try.
THE BRIDE: I can't!
PAI MEI: Because you're helpless?
THE BRIDE: PAI MEI
PAI MEI: Have you ever felt this before?
THE BRIDE: PAI MEI THE BRIDE PAI MEI
PAI MEI: Compared to me you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't THAT'S THE BEGGING!
THE BRIDE: PAI MEI
PAI MEI: THAT'S THE BEGGING!
PAI MEI: Is it your wish to learn how to make others as helpless as you Can you cook?
THE BRIDE: PAI MEI
PAI MEI: Can you cook?
THE BRIDE: PAI MEI ( pause )
PAI MEI: I'll be the judge of that. Draw me a bath.your training will begin tomorrow. That arm is still mine. You may lose it yet.
TIME CUT: EXT. WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate, he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall. The Bride stands behind him, watching. He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL. He turns to the new student;
PAI MEI: Since your arm now belongs to me, I want it strong. Can you do that?
THE BRIDE: I can, but not that close.
PAI MEI: Then you can't do it.
THE BRIDE: I can put my hand through that at six inches.
PAI MEI: And you could shoot a man from a rooftop with a scope-sight rifle, if you so desired, but this is not what I asked. What if your enemy is three inches in front of you, what do you do then? Curl into a ball? Or do you put your fist through
PAI MEI: Now begin.
PAI MEI: If you want to eat like a dog, I will make you live and sleep like a dog. Outside. If you want to live and sleep like a human being, pick up those sticks.
PAI MEI: It's the wood that should fear your hand, not the other way around. No wonder you can't do it, you acquiesce to defeat before you even
PAI MEI: In that pit, is a rat.
PAI MEI: In the sky, is a bird. You are to go into that pit, and catch that rat, with your bare hands. If you catch the rat, I will deem you the victor, and tonight you will dine on bird. But, if you can't catch the rat by sundown, I'll deem the victor the rat. And because of the disgrace to my student, I will be forced to kill it. And then I will force you, to consume his body. Because to be my student, you must develop a taste for victory.

PAI MEI: How does victory taste?
THE BRIDE: We do a Shaw Brothers ZOOM into a CU on Pai Mei, he gives an affirmative NOD and GRUNT. The BRIDE'S FIST goes through the wall.
THE BRIDE: ( to herself )
PAI MEI: Woman, is that you who disturbs my
PAI MEI: She does, bowing to one knee.
PAI MEI: What news do you find so worthy, as to disrupt my bath?
THE BRIDE: I did it teacher. I put my fist through the wall.
TIME CUT: PAI MEI and the BRIDE looking at the hole in the wall.

Elle drops the Bride's sword. As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is escaping before both their very eyes.

Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up.She falls to her knees in front of The Bride.. .then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the Bride's leg.

BILL: asleep, but one day you'd wake up and come back to her. And she asked me, "If Mommy's been asleep since I was born, how will she know what I look like?" To which I replied, "Because Mommy's been dreaming of you." And she said, "Then I'm gonna start dreaming of her." So I gave her a
THE BRIDE: which one?
BILL: The one I took of you in Paris, sitting on the steps with the baguette in your hand. Since she was one and a half years old, she's slept with that picture of you next to her bed.
THE BRIDE: You know, prettier photos of me do And she's seen them. But the one she wants looking after her while she sleeps is the one of you holding bread. We normally have dinner around seven, is that convenient?

JOSEPHINA: She closes the pantry door, and moves into the hallway leading to the living room. With her back against the wall, holding her weapon tight, she moves down the hall. As she creeps, an unseen Bill yells to her from around the corner.
BILL: ( loudly ) Bang Bang! Oh B.B., Mommy got us.
BILL: Oh B.B., Mommy got us.
BILL: Oh, I'm dying.I'm dying.
BILL: Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot You did it Quick Draw Kiddo. You are-the fastest.

BILL: ( to B.B. ) Hey, get back down there, you're playing possum.
BILL: So, as the smirking killer approached, what she thought, was a bullet-ridden corpse,.that's when the little B.B. Gunn fired.
BILL: Mommy, you're dead - so die.
THE BRIDE: Oh, B.B., you got me. I should have known, you are the best.
MOMMY: I know baby.
THE BRIDE: Every single night, baby.
THE BRIDE: Now let me look at you. My my my. What a pretty girl you are.
THE BRIDE: Thank you.

BILL: C'mon shy girl, you know what you said, tell Mommy, it'll make her fell good.
BILL: That's the truth. That's what she
MOMMY: Oh, Mommy spilled something on her No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid?
MOMMY: No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid?
BILL: Do you not like it, or do you not know what it is?
MOMMY: Well, it's a very tasty beverage that I used to drink, when I was a little girl. It comes in a lot of different flavors and colors, and it's really good. Maybe we should fix some sometime. Want to do that?
BILL: Speaking of fixing and drinking and eating, I think it's dinner time don't you?
BILL: ( to Mommy ) When you were doin all that fancy shootin, you didn't happen to shoot a nice Mexican woman about forty five years old, did ya?
MOMMY: ( wiping imaginary sweat Whew, then dinner should be done. ( shouting to the other Josephina! You can come out now, we're ready for dinner.
BILL: ( wiping imaginary sweat Whew, then dinner should be done. ( shouting to the other Josephina! You can come out now, we're ready for dinner.

BILL: Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is
BILL: You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at ( to Mommy ) ( to B.B. )
BILL: ( to Mommy ) Our little girl learned about life and death the other day. ( to B.B. ) You want to tell Mommy about what happened to Emilio?
BILL: running into my room holding the fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy daddy, Emilio's dead." And I said, "Really, that's so sad. How did he die?" And what did you say?
BILL: so strategically used were, "I accidentally stepped on him." did your foot accidentally find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And she told me no no no, Emilio was on the carpet when she stepped on him. Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And just how did Emilio get on the
BILL: did your foot accidentally find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And she told me no no no, Emilio was on the carpet when she stepped on him. Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And just how did Emilio get on the
BILL: what was Emilio doing then?
BILL: what was Emilio doing then?
BILL: didn't you?
BILL: didn't you?
BILL: ( to Mommy ) She told me later, that the second she lifted up her foot and saw him not flapping, she knew he was dead. Is that not the perfect visual image of life and death? A fish flapping on the carpet, and a fish not flapping on the carpet. So powerful even a five-year old child with no concept of life and death knew what it meant. Not only did she know Emilio was dead, she knew she had killed him. So she comes running into my room, holding Emilio in both of her little hands - it was so cute - and she wanted me to make Emilio better. And I asked her, why did she step on Emilio? And she said, she didn't know. But I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt Emilio, you just wanted to see what would happen if you stepped on him, Emilio, is you kill him. And you discovered that, didn't you?

And you discovered that, didn't you?
BILL: Emilio, is you kill him. And you discovered that, didn't you?
BILL: a little funeral, and gave Emilio a burial at sea. And right now I'm sure he's happy as can be, swimmin around in fish heaven. But the point being, our child learned two very important lessons. One, about life and death. The other, somethings once you do, they
BILL: did to Mommy what you did to I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot, like we were just doing. I shot her for real.
BILL: ( making his finger a gun ) I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot, like we were just doing. I shot her for real.
BILL: Mommy if I shot her. What I didn't know, is when I shot Mommy, what would happen to me.
BILL: Mommy if I shot her. What I didn't know, is when I shot Mommy, what would happen to me.
BILL: I was very sad. And that was when I learned, somethings once you do, they can never be undone.
BILL: Why don't you ask Mommy.
BILL: No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.
MOMMY: It put me to sleep. That's why I haven't been with you B.B., I've been asleep.
MOMMY: I'm wide awake, pretty girl.
BILL: Did she go to sleep easy?
THE BRIDE: It took her a little bit. She was excited. She's quite the little Well, if she doesn't like you, you got to kill her to say hello. But if she likes you, you can't shut her up. She's a chip off the ole blonde in that regards.
BILL: Well, if she doesn't like you, you got to kill her to say hello. But if she likes you, you can't shut her up. She's a chip off the ole blonde in that regards.
BILL: Red wine?
BILL: C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more fun with a couple glasses of wine in ya.
BILL: ( pointing towards the We're going to go out there and have at it, aren't we?
BILL: Well, I've already had a glass. So unless you want to win by an unfair advantage, you should have a glass of wine. So we're both on the same footing wine wise.
BILL: You know, there's an old man down here, his name is Esteban Viharo. He was a pimp. I knew him when I was a child. He was a friend of my mother's. I told him about you. When I showed him your picture he smiles and said; "Yesss, I see the attraction." He told me a story about taking me to the movies when I was five. It was a movie which had Lana Turner in it. And whenever she would appear on screen, he said I would stick my thumb in my mouth and suck it, to an obscure amount. And he knew right then, this boy will be a fool for blondes.
THE BRIDE: Who would of ever thought you'd be such a good father?
BILL: Well not you, that's for damn sure.
THE BRIDE: Must we have to endure your little No we mustn't. But if you're going to say sentences like that, in the future, I will resist the Baby, you don't have a future.
BILL: No we mustn't. But if you're going to say sentences like that, in the future, I will resist the Baby, you don't have a future.
THE BRIDE: Baby, you don't have a future.
BILL: I sent you to L.A. and you never came back. I thought you'd been killed. Do you know how cruel it is to make someone think someone they love is dead? I mourned you. Then in the third month of my mourning, I track you down. I wasn't trying to track you down, I was trying to track down - the fucking assholes - who I thought killed you. And when I find you, what to I find? Not only are you not dead, you're getting married - to some fuckin jerk - and you're pregnant? How do you expect me to react?
THE BRIDE: Why do you think I hid?
BILL: Why did you leave in the first place? You have cold eyes towards me now. I understand their temperature, but they were warm the second to the last time I saw them, or was that just my imagination?
THE BRIDE: The Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts will be shown on the screen. To give herself a running start with the story she starts it off in Japanese;
BILL: THE BRIDE
THE BRIDE: don't feel like speaking in Japanese anymore - on the plane, I threw up. When I got to my hotel, I threw up. So naturally I started thinking, maybe I might be pregnant. So I bought one of those home pregnancy kits. Went back to my room and took the test. The little strip said blue. I was going to have a baby. I tried to call you, but you weren't there, so I just thought I'd call back later.
BILL: THE BRIDE
THE BRIDE: tell you how I feel.
BILL: THE BRIDE
THE BRIDE: later. I was just so happy, I put on music and danced by myself in the hotel suite, holding my little blue strip. What I didn't know, was at some leg of my journey, I was spotted. With me in Los Angeles it didn't take Lisa Wong long to figure out someone put a hit out on her. So she sent an assassin of her own to
THE BRIDE: Hello, can I help you?
HOTEL WOMAN: Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel. I have a welcome gift from the
THE BRIDE: Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda busy at this second, could you possibly come back later?
KAREN: So you came here to kill Lisa Wong, huh? Well that's my sister, bitch. I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here to kill you.
THE BRIDE: Wait a second!
THE BRIDE: Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did come here to kill your sister. But I'm not gonna do that now.
KAREN: Oh, I know you're not
THE BRIDE: - listen to me! I just found out, right now - not two minutes before you blew a hole in the door, I'm
THE BRIDE: On that table is the home pregnancy kit. On the floor by the door is the strip that says I'm pregnant. I'm telling you the truth, I don't want to and I won't kill your sister. I just want to go home.
KAREN: What is this, bullshit story number twelve in the female assassin's Any other time you'd be a hundred percent right. But this time you're a hundred percent wrong. I'm the deadliest woman in the world, but right now I'm scared shitless for my baby. Please, you hafta believe me. Look at the strip, it's on the Sit down on that bed and put your hands behind your head.
THE BRIDE: Any other time you'd be a hundred percent right. But this time you're a hundred percent wrong. I'm the deadliest woman in the world, but right now I'm scared shitless for my baby. Please, you hafta believe me. Look at the strip, it's on the Sit down on that bed and put your hands behind your head.
KAREN: Sit down on that bed and put your hands behind your head.
THE BRIDE: Blue means pregnant.
KAREN: I'll read it myself, thank you.
KAREN: Okay, say I were to believe you, what then?
THE BRIDE: Just go home. I'll do the same.
KAREN: You fucked with the Wong sisters.
THE BRIDE: Facing Karen Wong, was the most frightening moment I have ever experienced. And that includes three years with that evil bastard Pai Mei. Before that strip turned blue, I was a woman, I was your woman. I was a killer, who killed for you. Before that strip turned blue, I would have jumped a motorcycle on to a speeding train .for you. But once that strip turned blue, I could no longer do any of those things. Not anymore. Because now I was a mother. A mother who only had one thought on her mind. Please don't harm my baby. Can you understand that?
BILL: Yes. But why tell me now, and not You wouldn't have let me go. Specially once you found out I was pregnant. You would've tried to talk me out of it. It would have been a big scene. I just said fuck
THE BRIDE: You wouldn't have let me go. Specially once you found out I was pregnant. You would've tried to talk me out of it. It would have been a big scene. I just said fuck
BILL: Fuck who?
THE BRIDE: Bill, you couldn't know I was pregnant, once you knew, you'd claim it, and I didn't want that.
BILL: That's not your decision to make.
THE BRIDE: Yes, but it's the right decision. And I made it for my daughter. Everybody on this earth deserves to start with a clean slate. But with us - my daughter would be born into a world she shouldn't be. Robbing her of the one thing everybody deserves. She would be born with blood stains. I had to choose. I chose her. You know five years ago, if I had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen. You performing a coup de grace on me by bustin a cap in my crown, would be right at the top of the I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?
THE BRIDE: You know five years ago, if I had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen. You performing a coup de grace on me by bustin a cap in my crown, would be right at the top of the I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?
BILL: I'm sorry was that a question? Of impossible things that could never happen - yes in this instance you would have been wrong.
THE BRIDE: Well what?
BILL: Well what?
THE BRIDE: Explain yourself.
BILL: I already have. When I told you the story of when I thought you were dead. Didn't you get how badly I You call that an explanation?
THE BRIDE: You call that an explanation?
BILL: Well if that's too cryptic let's get literal. There are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard. You experienced some of them.
THE BRIDE: You and I have unfinished business.
BILL: Baby, you ain't kidding.
BILL: You know how proud I am of you, don't you?
THE BRIDE: You know I was rooting for you, don't you?
BILL: You know I was rooting for you, don't you?
THE BRIDE: I figured.
BILL: You know on that beach out there I want you to be the victor?
BILL: You also know you're going to have to defeat me. I can't just give it to you, even though I want to.
THE BRIDE: It won't be necessary for you to give me anything. I've surpassed you. I'll take it.
BILL: Well, as they say in Missouri, show
