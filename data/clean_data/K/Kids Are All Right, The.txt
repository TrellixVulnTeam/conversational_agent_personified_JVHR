LASER: Nobody. Clay.
JULES: Can I ask you something? What do you get from your relationship with Clay?
LASER: What do you mean, "get"?
JULES: Do you feel like he's the kind of person who will help you grow?
LASER: Mom, you're windshield wiping me.
NIC: Hey, did you start on those thank- you notes for your birthday gifts?
JONI: Not yet. But I will.
NIC: I just think it's easier to knock them out when it's fresh.
JONI: Yeah, I know, I'll do them tonight.

JONI: Yeah. I don't want to.
LASER: Okay.I was just wondering if you changed your mind.
JONI: I haven't.
LASER: How can you not even be curious?
JONI: Sorry, Laser. I just don't want to, okay? I'm leaving soon and I don't want to deal with that right And also, that could really hurt moms' feelings.
LASER: God, why do you worry about them so much? They don't even have to know about it!
JONI: Look, you can do it when you turn 18, okay?
LASER: I never ask you for anything.
NIC: I just don't understand why you bought the truck now.
JULES: Because if I'm starting this business I need something to haul my equipment in.
NIC: Okay. It just seems a little cart before the horse.
JULES: What does that mean?

JULES: What? "Are you and Clay fucking?"
NIC: "Exploring" is the word I'd use.
JULES: And what if he is "exploring?" This is the age for that. Why should we care?
NIC: We shouldn't. I just don't understand why he's exploring with that loser.

PAUL: Who's that?
JONI: My mom, Nic. She's making me Why? What's she doing?
PAUL: Why? What's she doing?
JONI: She's treating me like I'm 12. It's like she doesn't want to admit I'm an adult.

NIC: ( marinated in sarcasm ) Really? You think so, Paul? Is that how it works?
JULES: What's going on?
NIC: Oh, nothing. Paul's just giving me child-rearing lessons.
PAUL: I was just saying

LASER: When you die do you want to be buried or cremated?
PAUL: That's your question?
LASER: I want to be cremated.

STELLA: Hey, have you guys tried those Açai fruit packs?
JULES: No, but they're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods.
STELLA: I know. Joel's addicted.
