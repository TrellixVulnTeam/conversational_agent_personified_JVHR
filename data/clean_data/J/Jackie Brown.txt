And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I aint never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I aint worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you aint gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.

LOUIS: INT. OLDSMOBILE ( PARKED ) - NIGHT Ordell is sitting parked in the comfy-cozy cab of the Olds, listening to soul music with his tiny cellular phone next to his ear.
ORDELL: Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
LOUIS: Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
ORDELL: Whatcha watchin'?
LOUIS: Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
ORDELL: Guess where I am?
LOUIS: I dunno.
ORDELL: I know you don't know. I said guess.
LOUIS: The moon - I dunno
ORDELL: I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
LOUIS: You're outside?
ORDELL: C'mon in.
LOUIS: C'mon in.
ORDELL: Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out I'm in my underwear.
LOUIS: I'm in my underwear.
ORDELL: Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.
ORDELL: You know what your problem is, Louis?
LOUIS: Who was that?
ORDELL: That was Beaumont.
LOUIS: Who was Beaumont?
ORDELL: An employee I had to let go.
LOUIS: What did he do?
ORDELL: He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did. And if you know Beaumont, you know there aint no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it aint gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em. Understand what I'm sayin'?
LOUIS: So we on the same page then?
ORDELL: So we on the same page then?
LOUIS: I follow.
"JACKIE BROWN": The sound of airplanes landing and taking off can be heard underneath this.
DARGUS: Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
JACKIE: The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
NICOLET: Can I be of some assistance?
JACKIE: I doubt it. Who's your friend?
DARGUS: This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that
JACKIE: Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
DARGUS: You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
JACKIE: Suspicion of what?
NICOLET: All he wants to do is peek in your bag. I'll watch he doesn't take
JACKIE: Go ahead.
ENVELOPE: Opens it. Out drops several packets of one hundred dollar bills secured with rubberbands.
DARGUS: I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
NICOLET: That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
JACKIE: Not saying anything at the moment.
DARGUS: This is your money?
JACKIE: If I were to tell you "no it
DARGUS: You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to I'm not saying another word.
JACKIE: I'm not saying another word.
NICOLET: Listen, Jackie, Hope you don't mind if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch of fuckin' pricks in Customs. Something about that job makes them kinda hard to get along with. Now, do you want to talk with a bunch of suspicious, disagreeable people like them, or a couple good-hearted guys like Mark and myself.
CLOSEUP JACKIE: Doesn't smile back.
CLOSEUP JACKIE: Sitting in a chair facing the two offscreen detectives. Jackie lights up a cigarette. We don't leave the CLOSEUP until noted.
JACKIE: Arrest me.
JACKIE: Okay, let's go.
DARGUS: You know, Miss Brown, there's basically three types of people that we come along in the performance of our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE. Victims, witnesses, innocent bystanders. You ain't any of these. Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These sonabitches have dedicated their lives to a life outside the law. That ain't you either. Where you belong is the third category. The category we refer to as LOSERS.
JACKIE: I'm not a loser.
DARGUS: Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away. Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
NICOLET: You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever the hell it was he worked for out here, he wouldn't say. Could it be the same person you were supposed to deliver this money to?
DARGUS: I'd like your permission to open this again. So we'll know exactly how much money we're talkin' about here.
JACKIE: Help yourself.
DARGUS: While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
JACKIE: My pocketbook.
DARGUS: What's in it?
JACKIE: Beauty products.
NICOLET: I'll count the money.
DARGUS: What's this?
JACKIE: That's my diet shit.
DARGUS: Let's see what else is in there.
NICOLET: Oh, Miss Brown?
JACKIE: Nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a half-inch or so of white powder inside.
NICOLET: And what would this be, Sweet and What the fuck is that shit?
JACKIE: What the fuck is that shit?
NICOLET: I know what it looks like.
JACKIE: You planted that shit on me.
JACKIE: Look, that shit ain't mine.
NICOLET: ( to Dargus ) It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
DARGUS: Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
JACKIE: I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
NICOLET: Well then, Miss Brown. Why don't you have a seat and tell us who might know something about this fuckin'
DARGUS: If she'll cooperate with us, we'll turn possession with intent into plain ol' Possession, and she can bond outta here for one thousand bucks. If she doesn't help us, we'll go for the Intent and request a twenty-five-thousand dollar bond.
JACKIE: You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
PUBLIC DEFENDER: Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty- five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
JACKIE: Who's side are you on?
PUBLIC DEFENDER: I beg your pardon?
JACKIE: What if I plead guilty?
PUBLIC DEFENDER: And cooperate? You might get If I don't cooperate?
JACKIE: If I don't cooperate?
PUBLIC DEFENDER: With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
JUDGE: Brown. Case number 700324.
JUDGE: The charge is possession of Narcotics with the Intent to Distribute. How does your client plead?
PUBLIC DEFENDER: She wishes to stand mute, your honor.
JUDGE: Very well. . Detective Dargus - You're the arresting officer in his case, That's correct, your honor.
DARGUS: That's correct, your honor.
JUDGE: You have a recommendation for bail?
DARGUS: Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the defendant's prior conviction and the extreme possibility of flight due to her occupation, the State requests a bond of no less than twenty-five
JUDGE: I'll set bond at ten thousand and set the date of August 14th for the When is that, your honor?
JACKIE: When is that, your honor?
JUDGE: That's six weeks from now, Miss Brown. We'll continue this matter then. Owens, case 72242.
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE: We go from a CLOSEUP of a boiling Jackie, to a perspective from the back of the courtroom.
ORDELL: Sits in the back, watching the proceedings without any expression. When he's seen enough, he stands up and out of the shot leaving an EMPTY FRAME.
TITLE CARD: "MAX CHERRY" INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY The bathroom door in Max's office. We hear a toilet flush behind it. The door opens, and Max Cherry emerges, zipping up his pants with a TV guide in his hand.

MAX: I can see that. Why?
ORDELL: I got some more business for ya.
MAX: Oh, yeah? What did he do?
MAX: The bond for possession is only a They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's It still sounds high.
ORDELL: They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's It still sounds high.
MAX: It still sounds high.
ORDELL: She had, I believe it was. fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty-five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
MAX: Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
ORDELL: Somebody already did.
MAX: You didn't hear?
ORDELL: You didn't hear?
MAX: Hear what?
ORDELL: Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out - hey, that rhymes - blew Beaumont's brains out.
MAX: Did the police contact you?
ORDELL: Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
MAX: The stewardess. Do you know her last Brown, Jackie Brown.
ORDELL: ( smiles ) Brown, Jackie Brown.
MAX: What does she do for you?
ORDELL: Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
MAX: Beaumont worked for you.
ORDELL: That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
MAX: Was she?
ORDELL: Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
MAX: You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
ORDELL: If there's no - what do you call it - confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
MAX: Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty Why would a stewardess bring me fifty You want me to speculate on what you do.

ORDELL: Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck - but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
MAX: Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
ORDELL: Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused -
MAX: Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
ORDELL: Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit - and mind you, I said "if" - it was just her shit to get high Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
MAX: Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
ORDELL: Okay, man. I got your money. But don't you ever ask me for no fuckin'
MAX: Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
ANITA: I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
MAX: But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
ANITA: I know. That's why I went.
MAX: But then you told her you were home.
ANITA: Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
MAX: I don't know. Maybe it's a language Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
ANITA: I understand.
MAX: I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
ANITA: I understand.
MAX: Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
ANITA: Yes, Max, I understand.
MAX: Dropping off and picking up. Dropping of Lopez, Anita. Picking up Brown,
ANITA: So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
MAX: I'll call her.
ANITA: Won't forget?
MAX: I won't forget.
ANITA: Thanks, Max. See you later.
MAX: Still reading his novel. We hear offscreen, a SHERIFF'S
MAX: Miss Brown. I'm Max Cherry. I'm your bail bondsman.
JACKIE: INT. MAX'S CADILLAC - NIGHT Max puts his key in the ignition, when Jackie asks;
JACKIE: Are you really a bail bondsman?
MAX: Who do you think I am?
JACKIE: Can I see your I.D.?
MAX: You're serious?
CALIFORNIA: Who put up my bond? Ordell?
JACKIE: Who put up my bond? Ordell?
MAX: In cash.
JACKIE: Can we stop for cigarettes?
MAX: Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
JACKIE: I don't think so.
MAX: It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
JACKIE: Couldn't we just stop at a seven- I thought you might want a drink?
MAX: I thought you might want a drink?
JACKIE: I'd love one, but not there.
MAX: We could stop at the Hilton by the Is it dark?
JACKIE: Is it dark?
MAX: It's kind of a sports bar
JACKIE: That doesn't sound dark.
MAX: Why does it need to be dark?
JACKIE: 'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by
MAX: CUT TO:
MAX: No thanks, I quit three years ago.
JACKIE: You gain weight?
MAX: Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
JACKIE: That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
MAX: What's your brand?
JACKIE: Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
MAX: Was she helpful?
JACKIE: She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender. I don't know - I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like' fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
MAX: You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like' fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
JACKIE: You're not tired of it?
MAX: ( smiles ) I am, as a matter of fact.
JACKIE: So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
MAX: I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
JACKIE: ( under her breath ) But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation. ( pointing to her drink ) How 'bout another?
MAX: But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation. How 'bout another?
JACKIE: Max gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named ROWEN for two more.
MAX: You know who put the dope in your Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
JACKIE: Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
MAX: They wanted you to tell them what you I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
JACKIE: I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
MAX: What did they want to know?
JACKIE: Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout
ROWEN: Can I get you two some popcorn?
MAX: No, thanks.
JACKIE: That's him. How do you know 'em?
MAX: I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
JACKIE: Ordell pick up his bond?
MAX: Same as you. Ten thousand.
JACKIE: The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
MAX: You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
JACKIE: I didn't?
MAX: No, you didn't. What branch?
JACKIE: Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
MAX: He's the one who wants you.
JACKIE: It was the other guy who busted me.
MAX: 'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
JACKIE: I have a pretty good idea. Ordell aint no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
JACKIE: I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
MAX: How many trips did you make?
JACKIE: With ten thousand? Nine.
MAX: He's got that kinda money?
JACKIE: It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's - what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
MAX: Cash poor?
JACKIE: That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
MAX: If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
JACKIE: Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm of today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
MAX: Ask A.T.F. They might give you Yeah, if I cooperate.
JACKIE: Yeah, if I cooperate.
MAX: Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
JACKIE: But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name - I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it - That don't give me much to bargain with.
MAX: Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
CLOSEUP JACKIE: I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
JACKIE: I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
ORDELL'S POV: Through the windshield, he sees Max's powder-blue Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie's apartment. She gets out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window of the passenger side door. Then makes a goobye gesture and turns, walking into her apartment complex. Max drives While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.

ORDELL: How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
JACKIE: I was expecting you. Come in.
ORDELL: You got some booze?
JACKIE: I got some vodka in the freezer.
ORDELL: Got some o.j.?
JACKIE: Ordell turns the halogen lamp to dim.
ORDELL: Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
JACKIE: Jackie moves into the kitchen area. Ordell follows her, hanging in the doorway, while she makes the drink. Jackie doesn't turn on the light.
ORDELL: You gonna thank me?
JACKIE: For what?
ORDELL: Who you think got your ass outta
JACKIE: The same guy who put me in, thanks a Hey, you get caught with blow, that's our business.
ORDELL: Hey, you get caught with blow, that's our business.
JACKIE: It wasn't mine.
ORDELL: Oh, shit. I bet it was that present Mr. Walker was sending Melanie. Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in there if you didn't. Oh, man, that shit's uncalled for, baby, and I apologize. I 'magine they asked you a shitload of questions about it, huh? All that money, want to know where you got it?
JACKIE: They asked.
ORDELL: And what was your answer?
JACKIE: I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
ORDELL: You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.
JACKIE: You're not asking the right
JACKIE: Beaumont Livingston.
ORDELL: I knew it.
JACKIE: And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
ORDELL: I didn't tell 'em anything.
JACKIE: I didn't tell 'em anything.
ORDELL: My name come up?
JACKIE: They told me.
SPLIT SCREEN: On the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is Ordell with his hands barely touching Jackie's throat. On the LEFT-HAND SIDE is Max driving home in his Seville.
ORDELL: Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at Beaumont. Or they were afraid of what he might say to keep from doin some time. I'magine from time-to-time they asked you a whole shitload of questions. And you didn't give 'em no
ORDELL: You scared of me?
ORDELL: You got a reason to be nervous with
MAX: Where is it?
ORDELL: Is that what I think it is?
JACKIE: What do you think it is?
ORDELL: I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
JACKIE: You thought right. Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
ORDELL: What the hell you doin'?
JACKIE: Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
ORDELL: Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
JACKIE: The cops didn't try and strangle my Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
ORDELL: Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?

JACKIE: Shut your raggedy ass up and sit
ORDELL: This shits gettin silly now.
JACKIE: I gotta tell you to shut up one more time, I'm gonna shut you up.
ORDELL: I just came here to talk.
JACKIE: Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
ORDELL: Well, I can get you a good lawyer -
JACKIE: Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
ORDELL: - Baby, I didn't -
JACKIE: - It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
ORDELL: One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
JACKIE: One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
ORDELL: I got a problem.
JACKIE: All your money's in Mexico.
ORDELL: I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
JACKIE: I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
DOORWAY: Ordell goes through FRAME, out the door, Jackie steps into FRAME, and talks with him.
JACKIE: I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
OVER BLACK: We hear a knock-knock on the door.
JACKIE: You want your gun, don't you? Come in. I'll go get it.
MAX: If you're having some.
JACKIE: I am. Have a seat.
MAX: You get a chance to use it?
JACKIE: I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
MAX: Black's fine.
JACKIE: Thanks, but I have my own now.
MAX: You went out this morning and bought a gun?
JACKIE: What, I couldn't hear you?
MAX: You went out this morning and bought a gun.
JACKIE: Let's just say I got one, okay?
MAX: Somebody loan it to you?
JACKIE: Jackie leaves the kitchen.
MAX: Jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records leaned up against the wall on the floor.
JACKIE: I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
MAX: It looks nice.
JACKIE: I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my
MAX: Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on
JACKIE: I don't buy new stuff that often.
MAX: This is pretty.
JACKIE: Who is this?
MAX: Who is this?
JACKIE: The Delfonics.
MAX: '74, I think.
JACKIE: '74, I think.
MAX: It's nice.
JACKIE: I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still Are you?
MAX: Are you?
JACKIE: I don't know yet. 'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
MAX: What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
JACKIE: I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
MAX: Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
JACKIE: It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in.
MAX: How'd you find that out?
JACKIE: He told me last night.
MAX: He called you?
JACKIE: He came by.
MAX: What?. What'd you do?
JACKIE: We talked.
MAX: He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
JACKIE: He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
MAX: No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
JACKIE: Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever used. He can't trust his other people. They're crooks. He can try bringing I in himself, but Ordell sure don't want to go through no Customs line. Either he recruits another Cabo stewardess, or he continues to trust me. I made him feel he still can.
MAX: How do you get it out?
JACKIE: Same way I been don', but first they got to let me go back to work.
MAX: You're gonna offer to set him up?
JACKIE: If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck It's very possible Ordell's killed I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
MAX: It's very possible Ordell's killed I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
JACKIE: I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
MAX: You're not old. You look great.
JACKIE: I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
MAX: It's not really something I think Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about How'd you feel about it?
JACKIE: Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about How'd you feel about it?
MAX: Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about How'd you feel about it?
JACKIE: How'd you feel about it?
MAX: I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
JACKIE: It's different with men.
MAX: You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
JACKIE: My ass ain't the same.
MAX: Max smiles.
JACKIE: Max smiles.
MAX: Nothin wrong with that.
JACKIE: I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you Fifteen thousand.
MAX: Fifteen thousand.
JACKIE: Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits , ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
NICOLET: Hey, Jackie.
DARGUS: Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
JACKIE: Take your time.
DARGUS: Well just be a minute.
NICOLET: Well just be a minute.
JACKIE: Can I smoke?
DARGUS: Go ahead.
NICOLET: What's going on?
DARGUS: She wants to make a deal.
NICOLET: She sound scared?
DARGUS: She almost sounds scared.
NICOLET: What's she want?
DARGUS: She wants to go back to work.
NICOLET: What's she willing to give us?
DARGUS: She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
NICOLET: She knows it's my case?
DARGUS: She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants
CLOSEUP JACKIE: Inside Dargus' office, smoking a Mild Seven.
NICOLET: Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
JACKIE: I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
NICOLET: We can look into that.
JACKIE: I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
NICOLET: You know what we want.
JACKIE: If I'm working, I can help you.
DARGUS: Help us do what?
JACKIE: Help you get Ordell Robbie.
NICOLET: Oh, so now you know him?
JACKIE: You never asked me if I did or not.
DARGUS: But now you're telling us now you do.
JACKIE: 'Course I do - I deliver money for No shit. You know how he makes hi He sells guns.
NICOLET: No shit. You know how he makes hi He sells guns.
JACKIE: He sells guns.
NICOLET: You ever see him sell guns?
JACKIE: Then how do you know he sells guns?
NICOLET: Then how do you know he sells guns?
JACKIE: He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
NICOLET: How can you help us?
JACKIE: Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
DARGUS: You don't want much, do you?
JACKIE: Can you do it or not?
DARGUS: ( to Nicolet ) It's your call.
NICOLE: It's possible.
ORDELL: We're back.
MELANIE: We notice that Louis is sportin' new duds. Louis' new "look" is a retro seventies-style bowling shirt and black Melanie notices the change.
ORDELL: We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
LOUIS: I didn't look like a bum.
ORDELL: But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
MELANIE: It's that late?
ORDELL: Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
MELANIE: Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
ORDELL: You two a coupla Cheech and Chongs, ain't ya. Oh, that's okay, I'll get it.
ORDELL: ( pause ) Hey, Jackie. ( throwing a hard look at Melanie )
MELANIE: I was gonna tell you.

MELANIE: No problem.
ORDELL: Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.
MELANIE: Want a Metrix?

MELANIE: It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big It's a diet thing?
LOUIS: It's a diet thing?
MELANIE: No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
LOUIS: No thanks.

MELANIE: Which one?
LOUIS: The roller disco one.
MELANIE: Louis walks over.
LOUIS: You're fourteen years old here?
MELANIE: I thought you were sixteen.

LOUIS: I don't like dancing.
MELANIE: Did you ever go I one?
LOUIS: I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars. Who didn't make the cut?
MELANIE: That's a picture of me in Japan.
LOUIS: You been to Japan?
MELANIE: I lived there for about nine months.
LOUIS: You lived in Japan, when?
MELANIE: About five years ago.
LOUIS: Who's arm is that?
MELANIE: That's the guy I lived with. his name was. Hir.Hirosh.
LOUIS: Must of made quite an impression.
MEALINE: I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
LOUIS: That sounds like a problem.
MELANIE: Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan. That's Japan.
MELANIE: Wanna fuck?

JACKIE: Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
ORDELL: Didja tell 'em anything else?
JACKIE: I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
ORDELL: You told them that?
JACKIE: It's true, isn't it?
ORDELL: What the fuck's that got to do with They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million - they don't give a fuck about that - They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money What did they say?
JACKIE: They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million - they don't give a fuck about that - They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money What did they say?
ORDELL: What did they say?
JACKIE: Ordell smiles.
MELANI: . so first he tries to get into the cocaine business but realizes right away that shit's too competitive. Piss the wrong person off, you get shot. So he says, fuck that - moves over to guns. You can sell guns wherever there's a demand. No one gives a shit. He acts like he's this big international arms dealer, when, come on, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.
LOUIS: He seems to be making out.
MELANIE: Is it dead?
LOUIS: She starts preparing a bowl.
MELANIE: Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
LOUIS: I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
MELANIE: He moves his lips when he reads, what does that tell ya. Let's say he's streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's still a fuck-up.
LOUIS: So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
MELANIE: That's not what I'm saying at all. ( pause ) You know where he went?
LOUIS: He went to meet that stewardess.
MELANIE: He went to meet that stewardess.
LOUIS: Does that bother you?
MELANIE: You live with him.
LOUIS: You live with him.
MELANIE: I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
LOUIS: Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
MELANIE: Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
LOUIS: And your point is?
MELANIE: Let him and that stewardess get that money over here.
LOUIS: . and just take it from him.
MELANI: . and just take it from him.
JACKI: . I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
ORDELL: Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
JACKIE: You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
ORDELL: That's a good idea.
JACKIE: If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
ORDELL: I don't know. One of your friends.
JACKIE: I don't know. One of your friends.
ORDELL: A woman.
JACKIE: If you want.
ORDELL: Yeah, I think a woman.
JACKIE: The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before.
ORDELL: But you don't?
JACKIE: No, I give it to someone else first.
ORDELL: And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
JACKIE: That's the idea.
ORDELL: So we need two people, two women.
JACKIE: Can you cover that?
ORDELL: I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
JACKIE: I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
ORDELL: I suppose you see a piece of this for Well, it's my plan. We're in this Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
JACKIE: Well, it's my plan. We're in this Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
ORDELL: Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
JACKIE: I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
ORDELL: Managers get ten percent.
JACKIE: That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
ORDELL: I'll give ya ten.
JACKIE: Plus the same deal as before.
ORDELL: I can do that.
THE WORLD": INT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY The Del Amo Mall on a lazy midday in the middle of the week. A few people, mostly black, mill around, but it's not like it is on the weekend.
JACKIE: The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes - you got somebody yet?
ORDELL: What'd you care?
JACKIE: What'd you care?
ORDELL: What'd you care?
JACKIE: Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
ORDELL: I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
JACKIE: Don't forget your bag.
MAX: walks into the food court. He stands looking a all the international fast food choices in front of him. As he tries to decide, he hears from behind
MAX: Well, hello.
JACKIE: He approaches her table.
MAX: I walked right past you.
JACKIE: I know, ignoring me. What're you up Catching a movie.
MAX: Catching a movie.
JACKIE: What'd ya see?
MAX: "American Prseident"
JACKIE: How was it?
MAX: Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
JACKIE: Oh, are you? Does she know that?
MAX: ( sitting down at the table ) . I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
ORDELL: ( to himself ) What's up with this shit.
MAX: I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
JACKIE: Does it happen to all men?
MAX: Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going And Annette's it for you?
JACKIE: And Annette's it for you?
MAX: For now. These relationships never last too long.
JACKIE: That's a goddam man for ya. Can't even be faithful to a fuckin' movie
JACKIE: Who was your girl before Annette?
MAX: Sandra Bullock. You know her?
JACKIE: Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
MAX: She's adorable. But I had to end it.
JACKIE: I'm old enough to be her father.
MAX: I'm old enough to be her father.
JACKIE: How old's Annette?
MAX: I don't care.
MAX: What're you, a bag lady?
JACKIE: I go back to work tomorrow.
MAX: You talk them into it?
JACKIE: They seem to like the idea.
MAX: Bring the money in and they follow Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
JACKIE: Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
MAX: You don't actually do it that way?
JACKIE: He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
MAX: Make the delivery somewhere in the Right around here, in the food court.
JACKIE: Right around here, in the food court.
MAX: Sit down, leave the bag under the
JACKIE: I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
MAX: He was here?
JACKIE: Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
MAX: I called you last night.
JACKIE: I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
MAX: You think he's got a thing for you?
JACKIE: Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
MAX: I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
JACKIE: He's setting me up to make a I see.
MAX: I see.
JACKIE: You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
MAX: Has he hinted around?
JACKIE: Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
MAX: You know some interesting people.
JACKIE: We weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
MAX: Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
JACKIE: He tries to act cool.
MAX: No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
JACKIE: What about you Max?
MAX: What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
JACKIE: No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
MAX: If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
JACKIE: You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
MAX: A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
JACKIE: You're avoiding the question.
MAX: Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
MAX: I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
JACKIE: A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
MAX: A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
JACKIE: When did you decide?
MAX: It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind - I guess it was Thursday.
MAX: Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail The day you got me out of jail?
JACKIE: The day you got me out of jail?
MAX: Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
JACKIE: Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's I dropped you off.
MAX: FLASH ON Max is dropping off Jackie at her apartment and saying
FLASH ON: Max is dropping off Jackie at her apartment and saying
MAX: And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
JACKIE: What do you do when he comes home?
MAX: Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
JACKIE: You do that?
MAX: That's my job.
JACKIE: Did you do it that night?
MAX: He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew - So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
JACKIE: And is that it?
MAX: More or less.
JACKIE: I'm not sure you answered my Which one?
MAX: Which one?
JACKIE: If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
MAX: I believe I said I'd be tempted.
MAX: Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison.

JACKIE: You know what's in the bag you're He say is a surprise.
SHERONDA: He say is a surprise.
JACKIE: Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
JACKIE: You said it yourself. Ray wants Ordell, he don't give a shit about the money. Money won't convict him, guns will. Yeah, sure, if it falls in their lap, they take it. If they know they got it, they'll look for it. but if they don't.
MAX: You're rationalizing.
JACKIE: That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
CLOSEUP MAX: Driving down the street, lost in thought.

ORDELL: What's your relationship?
LOUIS: What's your relationship?
ORDELL: She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
LOUIS: She believed you?
ORDELL: Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
LOUIS: Do you trust Melanie?
ORDELL: If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
LOUIS: That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
ORDELL: She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
LOUIS: You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
ORDELL: You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
LOUIS: Well, why the fuck keep her around?
ORDELL: ( smiling ) 'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
LOUIS: Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
ORDELL: I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
LOUIS: What does that mean?
ORDELL: You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.

ORDELL: What the hell you talkin' bout?
JACKIE: Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
ORDELL: How do you know she did that?
JACKIE: I was there, I saw her do it.
ORDELL: Well, you weren't supposed to be I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
JACKIE: I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
ORDELL: Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
JACKIE: Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
ORDELL: Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It ain't no big thing. The woman you saw was my friend, Simone. She's the one gonna be receiving the money, so I just wanted her to see how it works. She'll be here any minute. Nice woman, you'll like her.
ORDELL: Louis, call Simone and tell her to get her tail over here. We're waitin' on her ass.
JACKIE: Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
ORDELL: Man, I don't like that part.
JACKIE: It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
ORDELL: She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
JACKIE: Are you sure she don' know about the She don't know shit about the money.
ORDELL: She don't know shit about the money.
JACKIE: What does she think she's gettin?

JACKIE: Designer clothes.
ORDELL: She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
JACKIE: The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
LOUIS: Why we doin' I there?
JACKIE: I have a hunch they'll be watchin' me. We can't risk switching bags out in the open or even in the dining area. That's why it has to be a woman, 'cause we do the switch in the fitting room.
ORDELL: So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car - mission Where you gonna be during all this?
JACKIE: Where you gonna be during all this?

MELANIE: This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
JACKIE: What were you two fighting about?
MELANIE: He told me to go outside. "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
JACKIE: That coke was yours, wasn't it?
MELANIE: Oh, man, listen. I'm sorry about that. I hope they don't come down on you on my account. Ordell shoulda told you it was in your bag.
WANDA: Seven dollars.
JACKIE: He said he didn't know about it.
MELANIE: ( digging in her purse ) You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him. ( pulls out a ten ) I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
JACKIE: Beaumont Livingston?
MELANIE: You already knew that?
JACKIE: So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag - Is it tempting?
MELANIE: So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag - Is it tempting?

JACKIE: Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
NICOLET: You two meet?
JACKIE: This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
NICOLET: You talk to him?
JACKIE: Not really.
NICOLET: His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in What for?
JACKIE: What for?
NICOLET: Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
JACKIE: I imagine shit needs to be done.
NICOLET: We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
COPS POV: Louis with the van, at the storage facility.
NICOLET: Ever meet her, or they talk about Not yet.
JACKIE: Not yet.
NICOLET: Who's the other one?
JACKIE: White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
NICOLET: What's her story?
JACKIE: It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off And splittin' with her?
NICOLET: And splittin' with her?
JACKIE: I'm sure that was the idea.
NICOLET: What did you say?
JACKIE: I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
NICOLET: She told you that?
JACKIE: Was she there?
NICOLET: Was she there?
JACKIE: She didn't say.
NICOLET: But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
JACKIE: Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
NICOLET: Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
JACKIE: Right. Everything's the same, except one change.
JACKIE: I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
MAX: Do you think they bought it?
JACKIE: Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
MAX: You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
JACKIE: All he needed was a reasonable Right. Everything's the same except one change. Ordell thinks it's just too hot right now to bring in all his money. He knows you're watching him, and he's paranoid. He's keeping his stash where it is, but he wants to bring in fifty thousand for bail in case he needs it.
MEDIUM JACKIE: Right. Everything's the same except one change. Ordell thinks it's just too hot right now to bring in all his money. He knows you're watching him, and he's paranoid. He's keeping his stash where it is, but he wants to bring in fifty thousand for bail in case he needs it.

MAX: It'll be more than that.
JACKIE: Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
MAX: But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
JACKIE: Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty Where's the rest of it?
MAX: Where's the rest of it?
JACKIE: In the bag underneath.
MAX: What if he checks it?
JACKIE: He won't - I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is - on top.
MAX: You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
JACKIE: Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
MAX: Then you're out and you get nothing.
JACKIE: Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
MAX: You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
JACKIE: That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.

MEDIUM NICOLET: You didn't tell me you were gonna do some shopping.
NICOLET: You didn't tell me you were gonna do some shopping.
JACKIE: I thought I did.
NICOLET: You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit - Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.

NICOLET: But you didn't do that.
JACKIE: Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed And someone killed her for it.
NICOLET: Where's the bag she gave you?
JACKIE: She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my You took the time to pay the I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
NICOLET: You took the time to pay the I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
JACKIE: I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
NICOLET: What did you do after that?
JACKIE: I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started There was a guy with Melanie?
NICOLET: There was a guy with Melanie?
JACKIE: Not in the fitting room.
NICOLET: This guy with Melanie, that was Louis I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
JACKIE: I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
NICOLET: It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
JACKIE: I have no idea.
NICOLET: You'd take a polygraph on it?
JACKIE: If it'll make you happy.
NICOLET: I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
DARGUS: ( to Nicolet ) Can I have a word with you?
NICOLET: They both leave, leaving Jackie all by herself in the room, smoking.
JACKIE: I thought you were watching him.
NICOLET: We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
JACKIE: So what happens now?
NICOLET: We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
JACKIE: What about me?
NICOLET: What about you?
JACKIE: Do you think I took some of that I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
NICOLET: I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
NICOLET: If you have something else going on you haven't told me about, it's between you and Ordell. All I gotta say is, you better hope we find him before he finds you.
CLOSEUP ORDELL: On the phone.
ORDEL: . I can't leave here today. Mr. Walker, I ain't goin' nowhere till I get my money. You wouldn't have that fuckin' boat weren't for me. Man, I'm learnin' real fast who my friends are. Mr. Walker?
ORDELL: Can you believe that shit? Motherfucker hung up on me. Ingrate nigger. Do things for people and that's how they treat you. Goddamn girl, how can you live like this?

WINSTON: Cops can't locate him, huh?
MAX: They don't have your winning Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
WINSTON: Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
MAX: I think I do. Is that good enough?
JACKIE: INT. MAX'S OFFICE - NIGHT Max on the phone in his office, alone.
MAX: I know where he is.
JACKIE: How'd you find out?
MAX: All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
JACKIE: How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
MAX: People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
JACKIE: He's liable to shoot you.
MAX: On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
JACKIE: Ray wants him.
MAX: Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an
JACKIE: That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
MAX: It's not that simple.
JACKIE: It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
MAX: So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
JACKIE: Get Ordell to come to your office.

JACKIE: Tell him I want to give him his I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
MAX: I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
JACKIE: I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
MAX: What do you tell Nicolet?
JACKIE: Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
MAX: We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet - is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're

ORDELL: What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
MAX: I thought you might be asleep.
ORDELL: You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.

ORDELL: How'd you find me?
MAX: Winston found you.
ORDELL: How the fuck did he find me?

ORDELL: Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
MAX: Well, give it to me then.
ORDELL: Well, give it to me then.
MAX: She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.

ORDELL: You expect me to just walk in there?
MAX: If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
ORDELL: That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.

DARGUS: And you didn't tell the Police?
MAX: I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
JACKIE: Remember when Ray said you hoped you'd get him before he got me?
MAX: Hey, you.
JACKIE: I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
MAX: Less ten percent.
JACKIE: Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
MAX: I hesitated taking that much.
JACKIE: You worked for it - if you're sure that's all you want.
MAX: I'm sure.
