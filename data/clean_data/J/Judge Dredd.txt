FIRST RESIDENT: Lying Judges! A ER::! gets tossed into the VIDEO SCREEN. As it SPARKS, the residents swarm, knocking it over - then the chain link fence around the lot starts to shake, heave and collapse -
ZED: Hey, Homies. The rezzies are going Let's give 'em a hand.

VOICES: BLOCK WAR! BLOCK WAR! BLOCK WAR! Fergie runs into the building.
ZED: Did you see that! What a fucking shot! What a fucking shot - ! Reggie h -fives him. Then an overhead THUD makes them look up a- the HEATING VENT. Zed reaches up - yanks off the grate -
ZED: What do we have here? You a Judge, little man? The others laugh at the concept.
FERGIE: Me, a Judge, no, no -
ZED: You gonna stand up for your block, ain't ya?
FERGIE: Look, I'm out on parole - If I get into any trouble my ass is right back in Aspen - CLICK. Zed's gun is in his face. FERGIE ( cont' d ) ( quickly, cheerleading ) Let's go, Haven, Let's go Haven, Haven all the way - BANANA CLIPS are shoved into his hands along with boxes of Reload, dipshit.

VIEW OVER MEGA - NIGHT 27 A figure close to CAMERA straddles an even bigger LAWMASTER CYCLE that makes a Harley look like a mo-ped. The rider's GLOVED HAND activates the Lawmaster's CITY MAP.
UP ANGLE: The bike parts the flames like a curtain, SMASHES DOWN right in the middle of all the chaos. The Rider gets off.
BRISCO: That's our back-up? He's a sitting duck out there. You'd think he wants them to see him. Hershey smiles ruefully.
HERSHEY: If that's who I think it is. he Steps out of the flames. Six feet of armored justice, he was raised in a State Orphanage that taught him Duty and Honor. Now, he serves that State as Judge. Jury. and Executioner. ::is BADGE fills the frame: "DREDD".
TWIST: Fuck. That's Judge Dredd. We gotta surrender while we can He starts to raise his gun over his head. Zed smacks him in the yaw with his own weapon.
ZED: You chickenshit bowab! He's gonna surrender to us. And then we'll blow his brains out. ( shouting ). Come and get us, Dredd! Zed FIRES out the window. Reggie happily joins, then the others. Finally Twist shrugs, FIRES too.
REGGIE': More ammo! A terrified Fergie hands him a clip.
HERSHEY: Down! You crazy futz - !
DREDD: He's firing a 64 laze pumper from six hundred feet. He couldn't hit me if I painted a bull's eye on my We'll keep it simple. Standard relay. Single file. I'm point. Hershey nods. Brisco, eager to prove himself, steps in front of Dredd at the Heavenly Block entrance.
FOOD ROBOT: Delicious and healthful ration packs, piping hot and ready to Looks at his crazed "friends" and then backs up to the robot.
HERSHEY: ( TENTATIVELY POINTING )
DREDD: No. There.
40A: The squatters here are so busy FIRING their own guns out the window they don't SEE the CIRCLE OF BULLET HOLES that carve an oper.;ng above their heads!
40B: His shots catch most of the shooters by surprise. The few survivors throw down their weapons.
DREDD: This room is pacified. mcves carefully through the smoke. Behind him, Hershey and
BRISCO: This one's mine!
,HERSHEY: Dredd moves to stop him but he's too far away. Brisco kicks the door open -
BRISCO: This room is under BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA! Brisco is blown backwards off his feet.
TWIST: ( SUDDENLY NOTICING )
DREDD: You're all under arrest. Will you surrender, or would you like your trials now?
DREDD: ( INTO LAWGIVER )
DREDD: ( INTO LAWGIVER ) DOUBLE WHAMMYI ( CONTINUED ) AT-7 CONTINUED: 47
DOUBLE WHAMMYI: ( CONTINUED ) AT-7 CONTINUED: 47
TWIST: ( SEEING IT )
ZED: ( SHOUTING )
DREDD: Mega-City Municipal Code 334.8. Willful destruction of property. That's two years. WHAR:. He hits Zed in the face. Zed rocks, but stays up. He fries tc grab a nearby weapon, but Dredd kicks it away.
FAVORING ZED: DREDD( CONT'D )
ZED: ( tough, scornful ) Don't tell me. Life. CAMERA REVEALS that Zed another weapon hidden behind his back. Now, he goes for it!
DREDD: No. Death. He FIRES at the same moment as Zed! Zed's shot hits Dredd's ARMOR, pings off. Dredd's shot hits Zed's heart.
HERSHEY: I was supposed to watch out for him.
DREDD: He made the mistake. Not you. Dredd cocks his head, listening. Somehow in the din and confusion he has heard something. He turns.
FOOD ROBOT: Ummm, umm, yumm! Healthful and nutritious food rations, ready to Dredd suddenly pushes forward in the crowd. Hershey follows. She watches, puzzled, as he steps in the automaton's path, takes an assault rifle from another Judge and AIMS it!
DREDD: ( TO ROBOT )
HERSHEY: ( PUZZLED )
DREDD: ( aside to Hershey ) The guide wire in the floor isn't ( to the robot ) Five! Four!
FOOD ROBOT: Ah, just put your credit in your selection and - credit in the slot and-and - shit! The robot stops. The jumble of food in back spills out and Fergie uncoils from the cramped interior, still holding the scarK r.a wires he was using to manipulate the machine.
DREDD: Mega-City Municipal Code 1286.4: Willful sabotage of a public servo-droid. That's six months, He grabs Fergie, pushes him against the wall.
FERGIE: Come on, give me a break, Judge uh-.
DREDD: FERGUSON, Herman. Forget six months: You've hacked into city droids, computers. ( reading, interested ) Cash machines, robot taxis. And you haven't even been out of jail for twenty four hours.
FERGIE: Five years? But - I - I had no choice, judge - He sees Dredd's impassive face, turns to Hershey's more sympathetic one.
DREDD: Not at all. You could have climbed out a window, worked your way down. Or found a turboshaft and shimmied down the cable.
FERGIE: Sixty stories? It woulda been Maybe. But it would have been legal. I sentence you to five years in. Aspen Penitentiary. Case closed. Take him away. s-': protesting, Fergie is hauled away. Hershey looks at He might have been telling the truth. Haven't you ever heard of extenuating circumstances?

YAMAMOTO: Hold on, Judge McGruder - let's not blame the messenger! Judge Griffin
Ï¿½ESPOSITO: - Griffin has been trying to get us to swallow his crime package ( X ) for two years now and I still have
FARGO: Order, order! As presiding Justice, I only vote to break a tie. But I wish to address the question of Judge Griffin's crime package. Is there any objection?
GRIFFIN: This entire body owes its very existence to you, Chief Justice. America etched on t h e great DAIS. Only a few lights stand out ( X ) on all the conti nent: MEGA-CITY ONE; MEGA-CITY TWO; TEXAS CITY; ( X )
FARGO: This body is not the first assembly ( ' to think that more laws and fewer choices will bring peace and order. ( X ) That delusion has been tried and failed before. If the citizens of Mega-City are demanding more control of their lives, that's not a threat - it's a signal! A signal to open the windows of our society and let it: breathe - ( a look to Griffin ) Not to bolt the door and throw away the key! My fellow Judges, I was ( X ) barely in my teens when I put on this badge. When the time comes for me to take it off. let me do it. knowing that it stood for Freedom. and not for Repression. He sits down. Clearly he has changed the mood of the room.
JUDGE GRIFFIN: Once again, Chief Justice,'you have served as a moral compass for all of us. I. withdraw my proposal.
DREDD: ( turning, to Griffin ) A rookie Judge died there, too. I guess he wasn't worth mentioning.
GRIFFIN: ( WRYLY )
GRIFFIN: ( LEAVING )
WITH DREDD: Ch As Griffin leaves, Dredd turns. As he passes the Council ( X )
S: Ch As Griffin leaves, Dredd turns. As he passes the Council ( X )
FARGO: Four Summary Executions, Dredd. ( X ) Were they necessary?
FARGO: W ( X )
DREDD: With all due respect, sir, how can you say that when you spend most of your time - D edd breaks off; he's said too much. But Fargo won't let him she hook.
FARGO: Most of my time where?
DREDD: At the Academy. Sir.
FARGO: Don't you mean at the Academy wiping Cadet's Asses? That is what they say in the squad room, isn't it?
DREDD: It.. doesn't matter what they say, Sir. You're the.Chief Justice of Mega City. If rt weren't for you and the others like you, we wouldn't have our justice system. There isn't a Judge in Mega-City who doesn't want to follow in your I'm glad you feel that way, Dredd. Because starting tomorrow you're going to spend one day a week at the Academy. teaching. Dredd takes this in his stride.
FARGO: I'm glad you feel that way, Dredd. Because starting tomorrow you're going to spend one day a week at the Academy. teaching. Dredd takes this in his stride.
DR,EDD: I'd be honored. Unarmed combat, or marksmanship?
FARGO: ( exiting, with a grin ) And as Dredd reacts, we
CLOSE 60: sma:: SEALED BOX with a THUMBCODE LOCK.
MILLER': Miller. Warden.
COMPUTER VOICE: Voice sample and thumbscan The DOOR OPENS. Miller turns to the guards. MILLER ( cont' d ) Wait here.
RICO'S VOICE: Hello, Warden.
MILLER: A short one, I'm afraid. Duty We're both prisoners here. You behind a desk. me behind.., this. Fargo's reward for our services.
RI CO: ( LAUGHS )
MILLER: When you killed innocent people you went far beyond-'service. Rico stands. Moves toward the energy curtain. Glares at -,4 CONTINUED: 64 "Innocent"? A meaningless word. The innocent exist only until they inevitably become perpetrators themselves. In the end, "Guilt" and "Innocence" are merely a matter of timing.
RICO: "Innocent"? A meaningless word. The innocent exist only until they inevitably become perpetrators themselves. In the end, "Guilt" and "Innocence" are merely a matter of timing.
MILLER: 'You're insane.
RICO: Am I? When did you become a perpetrator? Was it the time you found money mysteriously transferred into your account? Or the time I was sentenced to death? You've been taking bribes for years, Warden. You're a criminal. And a stupid one: You don't even know who's paying you.
MILLER: I don't want to know.
RICO: If ignorance is bliss, Warden, then ( X ) you must be very blissful.
MILLER: Your mysterious benefactor has sent you a package. M:.. .er speaks into a console before Rico's laser-guarded "cell.
MILLER: ( CURIOUS )
RICO: The Ancient Puzzle, Miller: The One about the Meaning of Life.
MILLER: ( SARCASTIC )
RICO: It's over. And he AIMS the "puzzle". BLAM!
67 MILLER: The SHOT from the tiny weapon hits him in the throat. Gasping, ne falls onto his knees. With one hand on his throat, he staggers to the door while Rico descends from his platform.
MILLER: ( COUGHING )
COMPUTER VOICE: Voice not recognized. Security Breach. Autoguns targeting. panics. Scrambles for the door.
MILLER: BOOM' BOOM! BOOM! He's cut down ten feet from the door.
NO!: BOOM' BOOM! BOOM! He's cut down ten feet from the door.
DREDD: Kevlar nine helmet and body armor. WIDEN. Dredd is LECTURING to a group of CADETS who hang on his every word. We're in a TRAINING AREA like the one "Q" ran in the Bond movies. Dredd turns. A TECH nods: Target ready. Dredd FIRES a barrage of bullets at a mannequin in Judge's gear. The bullets ricochet off. The class OOOHS and AHHS.
DREDD: ( holding up the book ) Life, Liberty, and the Pursuitof Happiness. Old and noble ideas. ( X ) But they are what we give to ( Xi others. not what we will ever receive for ourselves. Class The class breaks up on a definite low note.
7R: HERSHEY( CONT'D ) ( X;
( X;: I caught your lecture today. Do. ( X ) do you really think that's what the ( X ) cadets need to hear?
DREDD: ( X )
HERSHEY: Well, I think your truth is relative. I have a personal life. I have lots-of friends.
DREDD: Really. How long since you saw any of them?
HERSHEY: ( DEFENSIVE )
DREDD: You've only been on the street a year. You're still in denial.
HERSHEY: It's not that bad.
DREDD: How many married Judges do you know?
HERSHEY: Uh, well, my class is young. None of them have found the right. e lust looks at her.
DREDD: Yes. Once.
HERSHEY: What happened?
DREDD: ( X )
,GEIGER: We've closed for the night.
RICO: You're holding a package for me. I'm. Rick.
GEIGER: Oh, yeah. Gimme a second.
RICO: I thought they destroyed all the ABC Warbots?
GEIGER: ( COMING BACK )
GEIGER: Whoa, friend, whoever sent you this is no friend at all.
RI CO: Oh? And why's that?
GEIGER: That's a Lawgiver. It's programmed to only recognize a Judge's hand. You want a weapon, I can get you something nice. But if you touch that it'll take your arm off.
RICO: grabs it! Geiger flinches - then looks puzzled.
ROBOT: Status. Commander. Mission. Rico strikes a match on the robot, lights a cigar.
RICO: Status: Personal bodyguard. Commander: Rico. Mission: We're going to war.
LILY: Vardis, if you're right, then this Judge Dredd isn't really part of the conspiracy.
HAMMOND: No, of course n9t. It began before he was born. It had to have.
LILY: Then your report tomorrow _will destroy an innocent man. Doesn't Dredd's future bother you?
HAMMOND: Yes. But I'm more worried about all of our futures then about
DREDD: Is this your car?
CAR OWNER: Hey, come on. what are you gonna do, tow me?
DREDD: Of course not. Towing is the penalty for the first offense. This is your second violation. ( into Lawg;ever ) Dredd aims, FIRES. The caz. EXPLODES! Dredd walks casually away while the car's owner stands slack-jawed with debris tinkling around him.
CAR OWNER: 92 WIDER
HEY!: 92 WIDER
92 WIDER: Dredd aims, FIRES. The caz. EXPLODES! Dredd walks casually away while the car's owner stands slack-jawed with debris tinkling around him.
DREDD: The wreck burning behind him, Dredd head back towards his bike. suddenly STOPS. He sees TWO FIGURES in front of him. And, the moment he does, he knows without. looking that there are two identical ones behind him. They're garbed for combat, yet without even the trace of humanity that seeps through a Street Judge's armor. These are the feared JUDGE HUNTERS. All have drawn weapons. The LEADER holds up a HOLO WARRANT with Dredd's PICTURE.
FARGO: Dredd. I. I can't believe it.
GRIFFIN: I'm afraid the evidence is conclusive. The trial will be just a formality. Fa:=c descends shakily from his seat. Moves to the window. :e =axes a pill from his pocket, tries to swallow it without ï¿½;_ _ f _ _r. seeing
FARGO: Is it possible? Dredd, homicidal too? We went through.this nine years ago.
GRIFFIN: We were able toâ¢hide the facts then. This time, we may not be so lucky.
FARGO: ( TURNING )
GRIFFIN: The victim was a reporter. The media is already sniffing around. Eventually. they'll get to the About . Janus?
FARGO: ( STRICKEN )
GRIFFIN: About Janus. and your part in it.
FARGO: How. how long have you known?
GRIFFIN: Does it matter?
FARGO: ( A WHISPER )
GRIFFIN: There's a way out, Chief Justice.
FARGO: Into oblivion? You're suggesting I take it? You-fiust really want to destroy me -
GRIFFIN: No. I want to save the Judge system. The media won't stop digging into Dredd's case. When they get to the bottom. they'll find you.
FARGO: My Walk will give you the Chief It could also save Dredd's life.
GRIFFIN: It could also save Dredd's life.
JUDGE HUNTER: In here.
HERSHEY: You're under.indictment? For what?
C: Murder. ( X
DREDD: Murder. ( X
( X: CUT TO: ( X )
DREDD: That is the Law, Judge McGruder. I would expect no less.
GRIFFIN: The Court shares in Judge McGruder's sentiments. In a way I am glad that Judge Fargo is about to begin his Long Walk.
MCGRUDER: The video you have just seen is prima fascia evidence that the defendant is guilty as charged. Mark this video People's Exhibit
CLERK: So marked. At the defendant's station, Hershey stands.
HERSHEY: Objection, Your Honor. This video is inadmissible as evidence.
MCGRUDER: Judge Hershey, are you serious? Both of them recognized Judge Dredd!
HERSHEY: That is the State's interpretation. Replay dialogue. _ï¿½EC rewinds. Then:
HERSHEY: Stop video. Do you hear it? When Lily Hammond says "Dredd", it's ( X ) part of the conversation. And when Vardis Hammond,,sa s 'Dredd' it ( X ) could just as easily be the same. The suggestion that either has recognized their murderer is sheer supposition. or, in the case of the prosecution, wishful-thinking! BIG REACTION from the packed room. Griffin bangs the gavel for THE DEFENSE TABLE 1r Hershey returns here to get another document. Dredd WHISPERS.
DREDD: Judge Hershey. I'm really glad I picked you to defend me.
HERSHEY: You only picked me because you didn't have anyone else.
DREDD: I'm still glad. ( X ) CAMERA FOLLOWS Hershey forward.
MCGRUDER: ( TO HERSHEY )
HERSHEY: It clearly shows nothing!
HERSHEY: Cadet Olmeyer is acknowledged by ( X ) all his instructors to be an expert in the field of still and video graphics. His affidavit states that this surveillance video is of such low definition that even after all known enhancements are used, no positive identification can be made of the killer. Since the uniform of a Judge could be counterfeit, I repeat my objection to this video being entered as evidence in this ( turning to Griffin ) I ask for a ruling.
GRIFFIN: Objection. sustained. The video is inadmissib e.
BAILIFFS: Order, order!
DREDD: That kid barely knows me and he wants to save my ass.
HERSHEY: Trust me. It's not your ass he's interested in.
MCGRUDER: Your Honor. I am forced now to enter certain technical evidence of a critical nature regarding ( X ) the Mega-City Legal system.â¢I ( X ) will need the Court's permission. ( X ) I will also need permission to ( X ) access the Central Computer Bank. ( X )
MCGRUDER: Central. I wish to access weapons schematics, Judges division. Describe the workings of the standard Judge's sidearm, the Lawgiver Two, and especially its improvements over the earlier Lawgiver One. Central SPEAKS. Somehow its monotonous, sexless voice hints at an actual personality.
CENTRAL: One moment.
CENTRALS VOICE: This is obtained in a download from my medical files and upgraded automatically every time the weapon is reloaded. Each time a round is chambered and fired, it is tagged with the relevant DNA.
NEW ANGLE: we slowly TIGHTEN on McGruder and her "witness".
MCGRUDER: Central. Were the bullets recovered from the bodies of Vardis and Lily ( X ) Hammond so DNA coded?
CENTRAL: Yes, Judge McGruder. It could not be otherwise.
MCGRUDER: And what was the result of the computer check of the DNA coding on those bullets? :ould swear that the computer is going for drama.
CENTRAL: The DNA is a perfect match for Judge _:iAMSER - WIDE SHOT
..EENS_ STATION: ( in shock, to Dredd ) DNA evidence is irrefutable!
HERSHEY: ( in shock, to Dredd ) DNA evidence is irrefutable!
DREDD: Do your job. She nods, stands.
HERSHEY: Your Honor. the defense rests.
5 WIDER: Griffin looks at McGruder.
MCGRUDER: Your Honor, the Prosecution rests.
GRIFFIN: The Jury may be sequestered. The Foreman, COUNCIL JUDGE ESPOSITO, stands.
ESPOSITO: Your Honor, sequestering is not necessary. The evidence is We have reached a verdict. In the ( X ) charge of Pre-meditated Murder, we the Jury find Joseph Dredd GUILTY as charged. GASPS from the audience. It's the fall of a Legend.
LIB: GRIFFIN( CONT'D ) ( NEW TONE )
GRIFFIN'S VOICE: "Let the Betrayer of the Law be taken from our Courts;" Already the Judge Hunters are coming for him.
HERSHEY: Dredd. I. I'm sorry.
DREDD: You did your best, Judge Hershey. He stands, takes her hand.
GRIFFIN'S VOICE: "Let the Freedom he stole from others be stolen from himself;"
H T: pan. e Judge Hunters pull at him. Hershey hangs on as long as she
HERSHEY: ON GRIFFIN - RAKED CAMERA "Let his armor be taken from him, and all his garb of Justice."
GRIFFIN: "Let his armor be taken from him, and all his garb of Justice."
!IQ: DREDD - SOMEWHERE wrists manacled, head down. The Judge Hunters pull off his ( X ) armor, then literally rip away his uniform. He's naked, helpless. Chained.

FEMALE CADET: ( READING )
FEMALE CADET: "Let him be written in our hearts and our memories." She hands him the Book. Receives his bundle of worldly h=_ongings in return. A young MALE CADET steps forward, hands Fargo an ancient REMINGTON.

GRIFFIN'S VOICE: "Let him be stricken from our hearts and our memories."
FEMALE CADET: A line of CADETS raises Lawgivers overhead. They FIRE a 21 GUN SALUTE. Fargo walks out. TYye gate CLOSES. ( X )
GRIFFIN'S VOICE: 44 -
GRIFFIN: Are you out of your mind, coming Griffin angrily starts forward. stops when the ABC robot moves to block his path.
RICO: I like to do things my way. ( X )
GRIFFIN: Yes, I know. Like framing Dredd for Hammond's murder.
RICO: ( SMILING )
GRIFFIN: Hammond had to be silenced when he found out abut Janus! But I could have used Dredd! He practically worshiped the ground I walked on-
RICO: Dredd only worships the Law. And he'd blow you away the minute he found out just how much you're pissing on it. Trust me: It's better this way. Let him see what it's like to freeze his ass off in Aspen. Let him see what it's like I to be me! After all. He moves closer to Griffin, smiles.
GRIFFIN: There's a lot of work to be done.
RICO: Yes. The Janus lab -
GRIFFIN: You'll see it soon enough. In the meantime. I want chaos, Rico. That block war was just the beginning. Now I want fear racing through every street. terror in every quad. panic in every block. Until those miserable rezzies think even their Judges can't save them. That's when the Council will turn to me. and to Janus. Rico moves towards the door. Pauses.
RICO: Fear, Terror, Panic. I think I can handle that. After all. ( slight.smile ) Look how quickly I brought fear in His smile fades and he exits.
FERGIE: Dredd? What are you doing here?
DREDD: I was convicted of a crime.
FERGIE: That makes two Â©f us.
DREDD: No. You got the sentence the Law required. The Proper sentence.
FERGIE: Proper? Five years just for saving my own ass? .It was a mistake!
DREDD: The Law does not make mistakes.
FERGIE: Yeah? Then how do you explain what happened to you?

COMPUTER VOICE: Zone A open. Please reset alarm. Hershey steps in, putting a small tool away in a belt pouch. She closes the door. Takes in the monastic feel of the place. She moves to the bookcase: A small collection of leather-bound books, maybe a dozen in all. Plato, More, Jefferson, Paine. Hershey runs her fingers over the well-worn titles.
COMPUTER VOICE: If Alarm is not reset, .system will signal armed response in 20 seconds. Hershey opens a drawer. A.few clothes. She slips her hands underneath, feels around, finds nothing. Opens the next drawer.
HERSHEY: ( off viewie, amused ) Well. Baby Dredd.

FERGIE: The stabilizers controls! They got hit, toot ( X ) CAMERA RAKES to the control panel. and a SMOKING, SIZZLING section. The craft tilts alarmingly. Dredd grabs the stick, helps Fergie try and pull up. It's useless.
ILSA: She turns to leave. stops when she sees the amused eyes of the man watching her from four feet away: Rico.
RICO: Hello, Professor.
RICO: ( off the environment ) I see you're still researching the dark night of the soul.
ILSA: The research ended when they condemned you. I live here, now. You showed me that facing death was the only way to live. Her eyes glisten as she moves towards Rico, touches his arm.
RICO: Don't go woosy on me, Professor. We got work to do. He puts his arm around her. They step over her victim on their way out.

HERSHEY: Central, I need to access the graphics database.
CENTRAL: That could take several days, Judge Hershey. The Graphic Database covers all known graphics, from the Paleoithic Era to today. Hershey opens the framed viewies she took from Dredd's apartment, slides out the one with the adult Dredd.

GRIFFIN: ( CAREFULLY ) ( CONTINUED )
ILSA: Since then I've learned innocence is just another lie. And that the best truths come only with pain. ( back to reality ) And. speaking of painful truths. Here's our shopping list. She hands Griffin the digital notepad.
