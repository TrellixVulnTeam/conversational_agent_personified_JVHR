ELLEN: Terrific. Act as if you've been here all How'm I supposed to do Look bored.

VAUGHN: ( droning along ) Holiday Inn joins the Amity Shores development condominium complex in a welcome expression renewed interest in Amity Island as the hub of the Northeast Recreational Vacation Wonderland. We're happy once again to be in the center of things, where the action is. We've had our share of hard times and long winters and the past few years have not been easy. But today, the sun is rising on a new Amity, a new island filled with promise. ( applause ) Len Peterson's Amity Shores Development is an exciting addition to our island. The Holiday Inn we stand in is likewise a new friend who we welcome as family. Amity means 'friendship' and our community extends its friendship to all who seek her shores in peace and harmony.

PETERSON: The speech was right on the money. Be a love and make sure the bar's open, will you?
PETERSON: ( to Brody ) Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd do without her.
BRODY: Me neither.
PETERSON: ( looking around ) Y'know, Brody for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
BRODY: All of us thank you, okay?
ELLEN: Watch Sean for a minute?
SEAN: Can I go swimming?
BRODY: No. Find your brother, okay?
MIKE: How old is your cousin?
BROOKE: Seventeen. She's a senior.
MIKE: I'm not crazy about blind dates.
ANDY: They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
BROOKE: That's awful.
ANDY: What the hell. Did your mom put all this together?
MIKE: Yeah, it's her job.
ANDY: Is she responsible for the punch?

TIMMY: Me neither.
DOUG: Me neither.
TIMMY: Who'd you ask?
DOUG: Tina Wilcox.

BRODY: I did, I did.
BRODY: Listen what are you doing later?
ELLEN: Fooling around?
BRODY: He dips with her; they look up and notice Sean, sound asleep on a bench.
ELLEN: Let's get the kid home.
BRODY: Home it is.
BRODY: ( to the kid ) You're getting a little big for this.
BRODY: They start to move a little, then turn face to face. Outside their door, the sounds of little feet; Sean padding
ELLEN: They start to move a little, then turn face to face. Outside their door, the sounds of little feet; Sean padding
BRODY: Sean's awake.
ELLEN: Door's locked.
BRODY: ( kissing )
SEAN'S VOICE: The milk fell out of the 'frigerator.
ELLEN: ( whispering ) Put a towel down. And shh daddy's
SEAN'S VOICE: His feet paddle off. Brody and Ellen start to slide together, passion resumes.
ELLEN: Bigger feet go downstairs; Michael's up. The Brodys kiss, trying to ignore the sounds of spirited discussion between brothers over who's responsible for spilled milk. Then the sound of a car pulling into the driveway, and a horn beep.
BRODY: Mrs. Silvera?
ELLEN: Mrs. Silvera.
BRODY: Need a ride?
ELLEN: As far as the office.
BRODY: Some people.
SEAN: What's daddy doing?

ELLEN: Do I have to?
PETERSON: ( taking the ticket ) Better get a sales kit together for after lunch. I'm taking some prospects
ELLEN: See you later.
PETERSON: ( to Brody ) Can't we fix it up to get this made into a green zone or something?
BRODY: Len, pay the two dollars.

SEAN: I'm not short. I'm eleven.
SKIPPER: Yo! Chief!
BRODY: You got a gold-plater drifting in the main channel. Big cruiser.
SKIPPER: You got a gold-plater drifting in the main channel. Big cruiser.
HENDRICKS: Off the Point. No running lights, just a diver's flag.
SKIPPER: Off the Point. No running lights, just a diver's flag.
HENDRICKS: ( aside to Brody ) Want me to run out there?
BRODY: On your own time?
HENDRICKS: Happy to do it.

MIKE: I don't need you. Andy's here.
SEAN: You always go with Andy.
MIKE: ( to Andy ) How was dive class?
ANDY: Same as always glub-glub, bubble- bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the Shells and lobsters and stuff?

ANDY: Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky.
JACKIE: How fast does this go?
ANDY: With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
JACKIE: Real fast.
MIKE: Real fast.
BROOKE: Far out!
LARRY: Coming up!
BOB: Gangway, Turkies!
ANDY: We're carrying weight.
LARRY: We'll take your supercargo.
JACKIE: Is that me?
BROOKE: That's you.
JACKIE: I've never been supercargo.
LARRY: Hey, get out of our air!
DONNY: Want a passenger?
BOB: Way to go!
HENDRICKS: Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
RED: Figure they split?
HENDRICKS: Happens every season someone takes off. Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox
ANDREWS: This is all there is.
HENDRICKS: If that's it, that's it.
INDIGNANT MAN: I can't watch the news, I can't watch a ball game, I can't watch movies all I hear is that rotten kid with his rotten radio. "Breaker, I'll do what I can, but you're talking about a federal jurisdiction.
BRODY: I'll do what I can, but you're talking about a federal jurisdiction.
INDIGNANT MAN: ( leaving in a huff ) So call the FBI!
POLLY: Black, two sugars.
BRODY: Thanks. What else is out there?
POLLY: One petty theft, one domestic disturbance, and an exhibitionist.
BRODY: I'll take the exhibitionist, you handle the others.
WOMAN: Chief Brody? I want you to do something about my first husband.
2ND MAN: What about enforcing the "No Parking" ordinance on Beach Road?
BRODY: In a minute, in a minute talk to Mrs. Prendergast, please.
WOMAN: ( continuing ) Albert keeps coming around when I'm with gentlemen friends and he throws mud on their
2ND MAN: ( eager to be heard ) Every time there's an out- of-state car in my driveway, I lose another mailbox. Those little iron sailboats cost thirty-two dollars
BRODY: ( to White Haired Man ) Talk to me about Mrs. Kinney.
BRODY: Hendricks has entered, carrying the camera brought up from the bottom by the divers.
HENDRICKS: Hendricks. I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
BRODY: Hendricks. I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
HENDRICKS: I never heard of a 908.
BRODY: I just made it up. It means, "Get me out of there." What the hell's that?
HENDRICKS: Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that.
BRODY: Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that.
HENDRICKS: Rich people. Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
BRODY: If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
HENDRICKS: If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
BRODY: Hendricks, get a description of that Chief Brody? I want to talk to you about my daughter. she's 15, but mature for her age.
LARGE MAN: ( to Brody ) Chief Brody? I want to talk to you about my daughter. she's 15, but mature for her age.
WOMAN: Chief, I've been telling Mrs. Prendergast that it's no good just talking about Albert, she's got to do As Brody turns to deal with the mess, we:
2ND MAN: Look the township is responsible for protecting life and property, and my property is unprotected.
UNDERWATER: Looking up at the surface, where a hull floats in silhouette against the daylight. There's a commotion, and a water ski drops into view. Then another one. Pale legs churn the water.
TERRY: Did you ever see a dolphin?
DIANE: Sure. They like to play. We may see some today.
TERRY: She fumbles with her skis.
TERRY: Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play with the dolphins without skis.
DIANE: Hang on, hang on. Okay, go.
TERRY: Hang on, hang on. Okay, go.
TINA: Take a break for a minute, okay?
ED: Tina stands, and looks out to the sea, where the boat is towing Terry on the water.
TINA: Eddie, can we do that? Can we go skiing? We can use my Uncle's boat. Eddie?
ED: Next week.
TINA: With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?
TERRY: Faster! Faster!
UNDERWATER: following the skis effortlessly, closing in on the turbulent ON THE SURFACE Terry whipping along; a fin raises near her. She glances at it, waves, thinking it's a porpoise.
TERRY: Porpoise! Look! A dolphin!
UNDERWATER: Closing in on the wake, crossing it.
DIANE: Terry! You okay?
TERRY: Help! Help!
DIANE: Okay, okay, coming.
UNDERWATER: Closing in on the thrashing figure.
TERRY: Screaming, as the Shark rises from the deep and takes her. Suddenly she's gone, a swirl of pink froth marking the water where she went under.
DIANE: ( screaming )
DIANE: Help! God, help!
DIANE: A last flash before the gasoline explodes.
DIANE: A sheet of fire, she's in the middle, screaming, aflame, the Shark forgotten. She falls into the water as the ruined boat overturns and there's an oily explosion.
HENDRICKS: I can't find anyone out here. They must've gone to the bottom, or drifted with the current.
BRODY: There should be bodies. Witnesses say two people; one in the boat, one I told you nothing here.
BRODY: Try dragging.
BRODY: Stay on it. I don't care how long it
TINA: We heard this noise, like a 'boomp' out there, and when we looked, there was just this cloud of smoke.
GRACE: That was the explosion. One minute they were having a wonderful time, the next, bang!
BRODY: I don't know what could've done that.
GRACE: I don't know what could've done that.
TINA: Can we go now?
TINA: Chief Brody can we go? Please?
BRODY: Oh, yeah. Sure.
RED: How much longer?
HENDRICKS: Until we find something.
RED: I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry. And cold. And most of all,
HENDRICKS: I think we got something.
RED: About damn time.
HENDRICKS: What the hell is it?
HENDRICKS: Here it comes.
RED: Oh shit. Drop it.
HENDRICKS: What is it?
RED: Power line.
HENDRICKS: Oh, great.
RED: It comes here from Cable Junction.
HENDRICKS: Untangle it and let's go We don't need a blackout on the island.
RED: ( at the winch ) Now you're talking. Let's get out of here before we do find something.
ELLEN: You have to smoke so early in the It's good with coffee.
BRODY: It's good with coffee.
ELLEN: So's a donut.
SEAN: I want Fruit Loops!
MIKE: Eat Cheerios.
SEAN: You eat Cheerios. I want Fruit Loops.
ELLEN: Eat Cheerios.
BRODY: What're you guys doing today?
MIKE: ( indicates Sean ) I don't know about him I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
BRODY: Every day?
MIKE: What else is there to do?
BRODY: You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
MIKE: Do I have to?
BRODY: You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
ELLEN: Where's my day book?
BRODY: In the den.
ELLEN: He doesn't have to work all the time, it's his vacation.
MRS. SILVERA: Good morning everyone up early There's a lot going on.
BRODY: There's a lot going on.
ELLEN: Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
BRODY: Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat. He's another one.
ELLEN: One what? Boat nut. What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for It's an island. Got to run.
BRODY: Boat nut. What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for It's an island. Got to run.
ELLEN: It's an island. Got to run.
MIKE: I'm going.
BRODY: What about tennis? Riding? Fixing up old cars? Bartending?
MIKE: Bartending? I'm 17.
BRODY: Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day?
MIKE: Look, humor the old man just be I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.
BRODY: Look, humor the old man just be I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.
MIKE: ( going ) I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.
BRODY: Don't go out if it's rough or anything, huh? We've had a lot of Okay, okay.
MIKE: Okay, okay.
SEAN: Can I go with you today?
BRODY: You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie.
MRS. SILVERA: ( to Sean ) You can come with me to the market.
SEAN: All right.
BRODY: I'll be at the office.
SEAN: Bye, Daddy. I'm going to be careful, all day.
LUCY: ( from her boat ) Where're we going?
ANDY: Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse.
BROOKE: The lighthouse?
ANDY: No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
MIKE: We got some stuff at the store. Ed and Tina are going to be there.
BROOKE: Oh, sure, they would be.
JACKIE: What's the lighthouse?
MIKE: It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. We sometimes hang out there, you know.
JACKIE: Great. I got some wine.
BROOKE: ( aside ) The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
JACKIE: Now I really want to see it.
BROOKE: You going to fool around with Mike? Well, I'm not doing anything with
JACKIE: Well, maybe I will, then.
ED: Come on back up here!
TINA: Give me back my hat!
ED: Give me back my hat!
TINA: Double nope!
ANDY: Why'd they decide to move?
BROOKE: Too hot in the lighthouse?
MIKE: Too hot for those two? I can't believe Is there something I don't know about?
JACKIE: Is there something I don't know about?
BROOKE: I told you, remember?
JACKIE: Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing it now?
ANDY: Maybe by now they are.
MIKE: They're moving pretty fast.
JACKIE: He's cute.
TINA: HER POINT OF VIEW The huge hulk of a beached, decomposing dead whale, a few birds still pecking at scraps of blubber and entrails. Big festering red holes mark its sides.
BRODY: As soon as I heard about it, I called you. This thing is big!
ELKINS: After we've looked, we'll talk.
HENDRICKS: This is it.
HENDRICKS: Move back, please. back off. open it up a little.
BRODY: See? What'd I tell you?
BRODY: Look at that!
ELKINS: First things first.
ELKINS: From the tip of the snout, please.
ELKINS: Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
BRODY: Come on, let's check the bite radius.
ELKINS: ( cold ) The what?
BRODY: Bite radius. You know, the size of the mouth?
ELKINS: The whale's mouth?
BRODY: The Shark's mouth.
ELKINS: What shark?
BRODY: The shark that did this. It was a shark, wasn't it?
ELKINS: We don't know that, do we?
BRODY: But that's what we're here to find out, right?
ELKINS: You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
HENDRICKS: I can't hear you if you're going to Can we go now?
MIKE: Can we go now?
BRODY: ( to Mike ) You stay here a minute.
MIKE: Oh, c'mon.
BRODY: You heard me.
JACKIE: We'll be over by the lighthouse.
MIKE: I'll be right there. Wait up.
ELKINS: Could be a shark. But maybe not.
BRODY: Look, I know a little bit about Do you?
ELKINS: Do you?
BRODY: I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon. Caradan.
ELKINS: ( helping out ) Carcharadon Carcharias.
BRODY: That's it.
ELKINS: Okay, so that's it.
BRODY: Is there one in these waters?
ELKINS: What makes you think there might be?
BRODY: Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish.
ELKINS: This is a mammal, not a fish.
BRODY: Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want to know if a Great White Shark did That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing And sound.
ELKINS: That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing And sound.
BRODY: That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing And sound.
ELKINS: And sound.
BRODY: ( this is a new one ) Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency So there's one around here.
ELKINS: Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency So there's one around here.
BRODY: So there's one around here.
ELKINS: Not necessarily. These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately fatal. Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
HENDRICKS: ( chiming in ) We got a helluva tide this month.
BRODY: Could you just keep that crowd back, You stay right here. You're going in with me.
MIKE: ( fidgeting ) You stay right here. You're going in with me.
BRODY: You stay right here. You're going in with me.
MIKE: We came out in my boat.
BRODY: Andy can sail in it.
MIKE: I got a date!
BRODY: She'll understand.
MIKE: She won't.
ELKINS: Lower jaw displaced and lacerated by predator attempt to seize the tongue. Additional large tissue loss in the dorsal and sub- dorsal areas, as well as the caudal. Oriamal bite radius 37 inches, allowing for salt-water erosion and subsequent small predator and scavenger tissue
BRODY: I don't want to discuss it.
ELKINS: It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
BRODY: Can't you tell?
ELKINS: Not when it's like this. This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
BRODY: Look can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy.
ELKINS: Don't be ridiculous Sharks don't take things personally.
MIKE: Dad, please.
BRODY: No more sailing. You come back with me, and that's it.
MIKE: Why me?
BRODY: Because I say so.
ANDY: I'll tie up at the town dock, don't worry, man.
JACKIE: See you later, Mikey.
VAUGHN: I'm showing summer rentals. We got a helluva season going.
BRODY: We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
VAUGHN: We're alone.
BRODY: Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
VAUGHN: Are you serious?
BRODY: Of course. Look I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator.
VAUGHN: No one has seen a shark no fin, no bites, nothing. Be realistic.
BRODY: I got a feeling. I have to act on it you can understand that, can't you?
VAUGHN: Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
BRODY: We have to do something.
VAUGHN: We have done something hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach it's the only one in 2000 miles, I know, I know.
BRODY: I know, I know.
VAUGHN: And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches! In New England? We all lost on that one.
BRODY: It's still a good idea.
VAUGHN: Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have everything you want; right now, the town's broke.
BRODY: Please, Larry there's good reason. Those water skiers.
VAUGHN: ( interrupting ) A tragedy. But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
BRODY: Two of them are still missing!
VAUGHN: There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. Are they all shark victims?
BRODY: Maybe they are!
VAUGHN: ( shouting ) Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
BRODY: ( shouting ) Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
VAUGHN: ( shouting back ) What am I, an ass? When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
BRODY: Someone has to do something.
VAUGHN: ( back in control ) Don't push it this time. If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.
VAUGHN: I've got to get back to work.
BRODY: Come on, give a guy a break.
BRODY: Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa.
BRODY: Hoo! Cold!
BRODY: ( ad lib ) Come here. Come on, Sweetheart. You bastard. A little closer. Here
BRODY: ( exultant )
BOTTLE: Macro close on a pharmaceutical bottle of Sodium Cyanide, from which a syringe is withdrawing a healthy dose. Follow the syringe and reveal Brody, working at his desk in the deserted office. He is injecting the deadly chemical into some jacketed .38 hollow-point ammunition; a dozen cartridges are lined up in neat array, he is filling the last of them, sealing the points with wax from a burning red candle. The radio scanner is monitoring the local police band: routine reports faintly in the b.g. a slow night in pre-season ANGLE ON BRODY As a sound at the door makes him look up. He hides the odd gear as Hendricks enters, starched and crisp in his uniform.
HENDRICKS: In here.
BRODY: In here.
HENDRICKS: I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
BRODY: You didn't miss much. Christ, what a Positive I.D.?
HENDRICKS: Positive I.D.?
BRODY: The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
HENDRICKS: There's an awkward pause. Brody sees the box with the divers' stuff sitting where it was left earlier.
BRODY: What about that camera?
HENDRICKS: What camera?
BRODY: That one from the wreck. You brought it up, did you look inside
BRODY: Well, what the hell might be something worth seeing. Take it somewhere and see if there's film in If there is, develop it!
HENDRICKS: ( catching on ) If there is, develop it!
BRODY: You got it.
HENDRICKS: I know just where to go.
BRODY: Not the drugstore!
HENDRICKS: Of course not, They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me.
BRODY: The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it?
HENDRICKS: Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
BRODY: Shit I'm late for dinner. Close up, okay?
BRODY: ( at the door ) Oh yeah I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
HENDRICKS: Brody pats his pockets to make sure the speed-loaders are safe inside, then exits. As Hendricks watches him go,
ELLEN: ( into the phone ) Thank you. I'll tell him.
BRODY: For me?
ELLEN: ( hanging up ) Sort of Matthew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next
BRODY: He starts upstairs, casually concealing the towel-wrapped package of gun and ammunition.
MIKE: Is Hooper coming to dinner?
BRODY: Not till next year.
BRODY: Oh, hi How was dinner?
ELLEN: Oh, perfect a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you?
BRODY: ( getting up ) Santos' place.
BRODY: Careful. What's wrong?
ELLEN: Careful. What's wrong?
BRODY: Nothing, huh?
ELLEN: Nothing, huh?
BRODY: That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
ELLEN: Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'?
BRODY: Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
ELLEN: Oh. Want to talk about it?
BRODY: Mike comes up the stairs, and is starting into his room when Brody spots him; Sean is just behind him.
ELLEN: Mike comes up the stairs, and is starting into his room when Brody spots him; Sean is just behind him.
BRODY: You want to come here a minute?
MIKE: You want to come here a minute?
BRODY: You want to come here a minute?
SEAN: Hi Dad.
BRODY: Hiya yourself.
MIKE: What is it?
BRODY: I got something for you to do I kind of had plans.
MIKE: I kind of had plans.
BRODY: ( Mike nods ) Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats.
MIKE: Hey, come on.
BRODY: No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there. You can work until school All summer?
ELLEN: All summer?
BRODY: He wanted a job, he's got one. I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
ELLEN: Not so loud!
BRODY: I know what you're going to say.
ELLEN: Do you?
BRODY: ( on the bed ) In the city, it happened all the time some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies. Call the cops. What are we, immune?
ELLEN: It was bad, wasn't it.
BRODY: The goddamn smell is always the same.
ELLEN: Are you going to be able to sleep?
BRODY: Yeah. I think so. Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake!
PETERSON: This is the town beach; the development naturally has its own private access, but I wanted you to see the concession area. Look at that sand like sugar!
ELLEN: During the summer, the sun sets right Over the water. Beautiful.
VAUGHN: ( to Ellen ) I'll say hello for you.
NICHOLS: Hello selling some more of the good life?
ELLEN: A piece here, a piece there, it all adds up.
NICHOLS: Your husband's been here all morning. What's he doing?
ELLEN: ( good-naturedly ) His job.
VAUGHN: Your dad got you working?
MIKE: He continues his chore, without enthusiasm.
SEAN: I'm helping.
VAUGHN: You know where your dad is?
MIKE: Up there.
VAUGHN: Oh, for Christ's sake.
PETERSON: And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer Len, can I see you a minute?
VAUGHN: Len, can I see you a minute?
PETERSON: I think we got a couple of live ones.
VAUGHN: Brody's riding his tower.
PETERSON: ( looking up ) Oh, shit.
JACKIE: This is fun! Can we go faster?
LARRY: ( to Bob )
JACKIE: She snuggles in Larry's arms. He waves to someone.
LARRY: That's my dad!
VAUGHN: ( to Peterson ) Wave to my son.
PETERSON: ( waving ) How the hell do we get him down from Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus.
VAUGHN: Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus.
MRS. BRYANT: Renee wants to know what that man is doing way up there?
PETERSON: He's, ah, watching. A lookout.
MRS. BRYANT: For what?
RENEE: ( a precocious little girl ) It's a shark tower. I saw one in Florida. He's looking for sharks.
VAUGHN: It's an observation platform. That's our Chief of Police. He's just checking it.
PETERSON: Normally, it's used for, ah, bird watching. Nature observation. Weather measurements, that sort of thing. Ellen, we're running late!
ELLEN: Okay. Folks, if we could get back on, we'll show you the country club, and stop for lunch.
PETERSON: The country club has an 18-hole course, putting greens, and twelve tennis courts.
BRODY AGAIN: He can't believe it. But looking past him, we can see it with the unaided eye: a seething dark mass, moving through the water towards the unprotected bathers.
BRODY: ( screaming ) Out of the water! Everyone out of the water! Get out of the water! Tell everyone to get out! Now! Out of the water!
BRODY: Get out of the water! Tell everyone to get out! Now! Out of the water!
VAUGHN: ( recalling another panic ) Oh, my God.
PETERSON: What the hell is he doing?
NICHOLS: Oh, no!
THE WATER: The dark mass almost on top of the swimmers, who are starting to look around. Most of them are oblivious to what's happening on shore.
FOLLOW BRODY: as his feet hit the sand and he starts running for the water, fumbling for his gun and the speed-loader with the cyanide bullets. He is bumping into people, knocking little kids over, stepping on blankets and umbrellas, a madman.
BRODY: Out of the water! Now! Everyone!
VAUGHN: Running too, half-stumbling, half-believing, remembering.
ELLEN: Moving after her husband, while Mike steadies Sean, holding the impulsive kid back.
ELLEN: ( seeing something ) Martin! No!
BRODY: No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear!
LIFEGUARD: It's bluefish! It's a school of bluefish! Chief! It's bluefish!
A SWIMMER: What's going on?
ANOTHER SWIMMER: Fish! Anyone got a net?
3RD SWIMMER: Someone get me a rod and reel!
BRODY: Sorry. I'm sorry. False alarm.
BRODY: Okay, it's all over, go on, it's over. No trouble.
ELLEN: It's okay. It's over.
BRODY: It's all right, everything's all
VAUGHN: Brody's a good man.
KAISER: Nobody says he isn't.
PETERSON: You should've been out there. You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac. There were shots fired!
VAUGHN: He thought he had a good reason.
MS. NICHOLS: But that's not rational behavior!
PETERSON: That's what I'm saying!
VAUGHN: How many people were there?
MS. NICHOLS: Hundred! Literally hundreds. What are they going to say about us?
PETERSON: ( to Vaughn ) Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
VAUGHN: So? So?
PETERSON: So it can't be done like that. The man's a menace, plain and simple.
VAUGHN: Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over. We have to deal with the consequences.
SANSOM: That's what we're here to do.
VAUGHN: All right. Let's go into my office, where we can have a little privacy.
VAUGHN: I believe we have a quorum, and informally, I suggest we call this meeting an executive session and dispense with minutes.
BRODY: Polly, no calls, please. Okay, okay. Hello. Phil? Fogarty? What pictures. I'll be right down.
PHIL: I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped. I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days. Believe me, it's a pleasure.
BRODY: You said something about a camera.
PHIL: Sure, sure Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in-law, in Montauk, he works at a hi-fi store, and they sell cameras, so he.
BRODY: ( interrupting ) Did you get any pictures?
PHIL: Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing. You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up. Here's a test I did.
PHIL: Not bad that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion, What else you got?
BRODY: What else you got?
PHIL: Let's see you got a minute?
BRODY: Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
PHIL: Okay, okay stand over there.
PETERSON: ( looking up ) Speak of the devil.
BRODY: Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you. Proof!
VAUGHN: Martin, this is kind of an official Perfect. Look at this -
BRODY: Perfect. Look at this -
VAUGHN: Chief the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
BRODY: ( preoccupied ) Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
PETERSON: Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
BRODY: Temporarily? Uh. sure. The question's out of left field. Why are they asking?
NICHOLS: So Jeff could handle things? He knows the routine, he has the authority?
BRODY: Yeah. Why?
PETERSON: It came up during the meeting.
BRODY: Look I just got this from Phil Fogarty. It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
KAISER: It's underwater, isn't it? That's why it's so dark.
NICHOLS: It's underwater, isn't it? That's why it's so dark.
SANSOM: I don't know what is it?
BRODY: It's a shark! A Great White! Jesus, it's right there!
INSERT PHOTO: Just as before, an ambiguous pattern of light and dark; not proof of anything without Brody's inner vision.
BRODY: What are you all, blind? It's a shark. Look teeth, jaw, gills.
PETERSON: Is that what it is?
BRODY: You're damn right that's what it is.
NICHOLS: I'm sorry, I just don't see it.
VAUGHN: Martin, it could be anything.
BRODY: ( exploding ) What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand? I've seen this sonofabitch
PETERSON: What have you seen before? This is nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Something in the lens.
BRODY: My ass!
VAUGHN: Be reasonable, please.
PETERSON: ( to Vaughn ) Forget it, he won't listen.
BRODY: There is nothing to discuss.
PETERSON: ( blowing up ) Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him? ( to Brody ) You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured what if somebody decides to sue us? That could ruin us.
BRODY: Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I'll pay for it. Take it out of my You don't make enough.
PETERSON: You don't make enough.
BRODY: Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
PETERSON: What's that supposed to mean?
BRODY: It means I don't like all that grab- ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there and I don't want to go through that horror again.
VAUGHN: Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
BRODY: Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
PETERSON: I won't mention his personal attack on me.
NICHOLS: I've never seen him like this.
PETERSON: And Hendricks is qualified, you heard that from his own mouth.
KAISER: We made a motion and it was already Very well then. It is moved and seconded that Martin Brody be relieved of his duties as Chief of Police, his contract with the township be terminated, and that Jeff Hendricks be appointed Acting Chief in the interim. Those in favor?
VAUGHN: ( official ) Very well then. It is moved and seconded that Martin Brody be relieved of his duties as Chief of Police, his contract with the township be terminated, and that Jeff Hendricks be appointed Acting Chief in the interim. Those in favor?
PETERSON: Anyone opposed, or is it unanimous?
VAUGHN: I'm sorry, but I respect his convictions. The motion is carried.
VAUGHN: Martin? Could you come in please?
ELLEN: Hi. I closed a sale today, without Len. That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
BRODY: That's great.
ELLEN: Sean's asleep.
BRODY: That's great too. Gorgeous.
BRODY: You look about 22 years old sitting there. Like you were doing homework.
ELLEN: ( sensitive ) What's wrong?
BRODY: Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, that's all.
ELLEN: What'd I say?
BRODY: What'd I say?
ELLEN: That you were fired.
BRODY: Then that's what I meant. Fired. Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police. Just like that.
ELLEN: Because of today? The beach?
BRODY: ( expansively ) No sweat. A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat. we're surrounded by water here, you realize that? Me, surrounded by water. Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened!
ELLEN: Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened!
BRODY: Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it. Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture. He's out there, somewhere. I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me.
ELLEN: ( studying the photo ) Honey, this is nothing. I don't know what it is. What did they.
BRODY: ( going on ) .Everybody wants the job. No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks. Fine. He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. Call me in New York. tell him to kiss my ass.
ELLEN: ( seeing his pain ) They have no right to treat you like that. You've given them everything. For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this Fired me! ( at Ellen ) I'm not a hysterical man. I'm responsible. I know what I saw.
BRODY: Fired me! I'm not a hysterical man. I'm responsible. I know what I saw.
ELLEN: I know you did.
BRODY: I try. Goddamnit, I tried. Now, I'm tired. I can't keep fighting it. I'm too tired. I'm. I'm.
ELLEN: You're drunk is what you are.
ELLEN: Take it easy. Easy.
SEAN: Is dad home? I heard something.
ELLEN: Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy's
SEAN: What's this?
ELLEN: Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed.
DOUG: ( holding a book ) That's what I want a gaff rig.
TIMMY: Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
BOB: Hey, Mike I saw your dad over at the town hall.
MIKE: I know.
DOUG: ( innocently ) Did he really freak out at the beach?
MIKE: I don't know.
ANDY: Hey, it's all bullshit. Anyone want to play pong for money?
LARRY: How was the show?
ED: It was okay.
TINA: It was okay.
PATRICK: I'd rather go the lighthouse.
LUCY: Who wouldn't.
POLO: Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
BROOKE: Now? At night?
POLO: Nah. Tomorrow. Early, spend the day. My folks left two cases of beer in the garage.
PATRICK: Is it still there?
POLO: Nope. Got it in my boat.
LUCY: Let's go for it. Mike, you going?
JACKIE: Let's go for it. Mike, you going?
TINA: Mike, you going?
MIKE: Why shouldn't I?
LARRY: I thought you might still be painting the restrooms at the beach.
BROOKE: Anyone want a coke or anything?
JACKIE: I'd like to go out to the lighthouse with you.
MIKE: I'm not sure I can.
JACKIE: It'll be fun, come on!
MIKE: Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach.
JACKIE: No way. Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
MIKE: That's not it. My dad told me not to You do everything your parents tell Good. I'll be on the dock at eight. Eight o'clock, everybody!
JACKIE: You do everything your parents tell Good. I'll be on the dock at eight. Eight o'clock, everybody!
MIKE: Good. I'll be on the dock at eight. Eight o'clock, everybody!
JACKIE: Good. I'll be on the dock at eight. Eight o'clock, everybody!
JACKIE: ( aside to Mike ) I really want to to be there. ( to the crowd ) Who's bringing the wine? And who's got a quarter for the box?
BROOKE: She just likes to tease. I think she really likes you.
MIKE: Some rock music starts, and we:
SEAN: ( whispering ) You're going out.
MIKE: You're going sailing.
SEAN: You're going sailing.
MIKE: Take me.
SEAN: Take me.
MIKE: ( louder ) I want to go with you!
SEAN: ( louder ) I want to go with you!
MIKE: Quiet! Shhh!
SEAN: ( even louder ) Okay, okay. Close your door.
MIKE: Okay, okay. Close your door.
BRODY: Good morning, America.
ELLEN: What're you going to do today?
BRODY: Turn in the car. Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your I'll give notice.
ELLEN: I'll give notice.
BRODY: Don't rush into it we may need the income.
BRODY: Mike left early. Couldn't wait to make out. Must be a morning man.
MRS. SILVERA: Morning. Anything special today?
ELLEN: Sean's not up yet. You know what he likes, just some Fruit Loops and milk. No candy.
BRODY: The sink upstairs is busted. Try some Drano, or a plunger, maybe. Or call your brother, the plumber, what's his name.
MRS. SILVERA: Frankie. He's my cousin.
BRODY: Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs an apprentice.
MRS. SILVERA: Have a nice day.
ANDY: If you're beached, why are we doing this? For practice?
MIKE: Then why are we futzing around the dock? We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
ANDY: Then why are we futzing around the dock? We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
MIKE: Look if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
SEAN: I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in the way?
ANDY: You're always in the way.
MARGE: This guy giving you any trouble?
SEAN: Put me down!
ANDY: Put him down in the water.
MARGE: ( to Sean ) You want to go out in my boat?
SEAN: Would you take him?
MIKE: Would you take him?
MARGE: You've just made someone very happy.
ANDY: You've just made someone very happy.
BROOKE: Mike! Are you going out?
MIKE: I thought you were grounded.
JACKIE: I thought you were grounded.
MIKE: I can go out if I want to.
ANDY: You can?
JACKIE: You going to the lighthouse?
MIKE: Why not?
ANDY: I could give you a dozen good reasons.
MIKE: ( to Andy ) Shut up.
ANDY: Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind Is there room on your boat for all of us?
JACKIE: Is there room on your boat for all of us?
ANDY: Well, we're pretty crowded, and I don't know when we're leaving.
TIMMY: I've got room.
BROOKE: ( to Andy ) That's okay I'll go with Timmy.
TIMMY: You will?
BROOKE: And she walks towards his boat, looking back for him to follow. He's dumbstruck by his sudden good fortune.
TIMMY: He runs to join her, untying mooring lines like crazy; they're together again at last for the first time. Andy is left shuffling with Mike and Jackie.
JACKIE: I'm ready. Come on, you guys.
JACKIE: Come on, you guys.
ANDY: Well, I don't know.
JACKIE: Please come with us?
JACKIE: For me.?
ANDY: What the hell. For you.
BOB: I thought you said she was going with us?
LARRY: Let's just go sailing, okay?
BOB: ( casting off ) Want to talk about it?
LARRY: Want to swim home?
QUICK CUTS: Sails being trimmed. Brooke and Timmy, staring into each other's eyes as he sets a course straight for the lighthouse. Larry, lifting a hull, almost losing Bob.
ANDREWS: Hey! Nicholas! You're supposed to be in class!
ANDY: Today I'm staying topside. You dive for me!
ANDREWS: I'm going for lobster.
JACKIE: Great! Find one for me.
ANDY: With butter, if they got any.
ANDREWS: So long, turkies.
ANDREWS: Sparky will take you down today. If everyone's got a buddy, we'll drop. Let's get some dinner.
CROSBY: ( to Andrews ) Let's get some dinner.
UNDERWATER: The class, paired up, is drifting down; Sparky offering encouragement as they descend. Andrews and Crosby are already disappearing, swimming away with strong kicks.
THE DIVERS: look over at the rocketing ascent. What's wrong? Sparky signals "up," and they begin to carefully follow him towards the surface. Crosby's already surfacing.
SPARKY: Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us
TINA: You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
ED: ( snuggling close ) Just like this.
TINA: What about sailing?
ED: The tide's running. It'll take us to the light.
TINA: It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful. First things first.
ED: First things first.
TINA: What about the others?
ED: They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
TINA: What're we going to do in the mean I dunno. We'll think of something.
ED: I dunno. We'll think of something.
ED: But first, a little juice.
TINA: And second?
ED: ( kissing her ) ( resisting ) Wait a minute. Promise me something.
TINA: ( resisting ) Wait a minute. Promise me something.
ED: Anything. Anything.
TINA: That you'll put down a blanket. I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
ED: You got it.
UNDERWATER: The Sandpiper's hull, alone above us, as the Shark rises with dreadful certainty, attracted by the erratic sounds of Ed's hasty search.
REVERSE: Tina is staring down at the water, terror-stricken; Ed's arms and head are f.g., as he locks onto the boat with desperate hands.
INSERT: Ed's hands on the rail, knuckles white, an iron grip. With awful finality, the force pulls down, and the wood shatters and splits away as Ed's hands are pulled down and under by the awful force.
TINA: her mouth working silently, unable to scream, staring down at the blood and froth on the water, swirling in a grim eddy under her, the Sandpiper rocking gently in the diminishing EXT. OCEAN - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT On the way to the lighthouse, but away from the harbor, the Kids are sailing in fairly close order: The sloops ( Polo, Timmy, Marge ) heeled well over in the stiff breeze, the faster cats ( Mike, Larry, Donny, etc. ) skimming around, tacking more often, faster and more maneuverable.
LUCY: Faster! Faster!
PATRICK: Coming about.
POLO: ( to a near-by boat ) Great day! I think the wind's going to change.
MARGE: Coming up.
SEAN: Slowpoke! Slowpoke! Marge is faster!
DOUG: I'm getting new sails, then watch out. Just a question of modifying the rigging!
JACKIE: Wheee! Faster!
ANDY: How fast is enough?
JACKIE: I want to go faster!
MIKE: Hang on.
BOB: You coming up on him?
LARRY: You bet. Hang on.
LARRY: Coming up! Give way!
ANDY: Like hell! We're on the starboard
JACKIE: Don't let him pass. Faster!
JACKIE: My hair's getting wet!
ANDY: So's mine.
JACKIE: When do we get to the lighthouse?
ANDY: Soon, dark eyes, soon.
MIKE: The tide's turning.
ANDY: We're going to be fighting the Wind's backing around a few points,
JACKIE: I can't wait to get there.
ANDY: But of course.
ELLEN: Hey it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
BRODY: Just one minute.
DOCKSIDE: The dive boat is moored at a clumsy angle next to the Police Boat, where Hendricks has been pulling routine maintenance. The Police launch is cluttered with tools and spare parts; some non-essential piece of gear is stripped and laid out on the deck. Hendricks is on the dive boat, kneeling next to ABOARD THE DIVE BOAT Andrews is shaking, bloody froth on his lips and chest. The shaken divers are huddled together, an ambulance attendant is wheeling a gurney into position. Crosby and Sparky are
BRODY: What the hell happened?
SPARKY: Embolism. Air bubbles in his blood. Came up too damn fast. Held his goddamn breath!
HENDRICKS: He panicked! Something scared him!
CROSBY: He panicked! Something scared him!
ATTENDANT: It's okay. We're taking care of him.
BRODY: How'd this happen?
SPARKY: Bite reflex, like a spasm.
BRODY: Right after, the Kids went out?
HENDRICKS: Right after, the Kids went out?
ELLEN: What Kids? Who went out?
HENDRICKS: All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy all that whole gang.
ELLEN: Mike? Our Mike?
HENDRICKS: Yep. Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
BRODY: How long ago?
HENDRICKS: About an hour, maybe two. Let's see I came on about eight.
ELLEN: What're you doing?
BRODY: Going out.
HENDRICKS: Uh, Chief look. You're not Chief any more.
HENDRICKS: I can't let you take her out.
BRODY: You can't stop me.
HENDRICKS: Mrs. Brody, look if he can't go, then you can't go. Neither of you can go.
ELLEN: I'm going.
BRODY: Mike's out there.
HENDRICKS: But I signed for the boat. You're not authorized any more.
BRODY: Untie that rope.
HENDRICKS: Please. It's my job.
ELLEN: I'll do it.
HENDRICKS: Mrs. Brody, please.
HENDRICKS: You're too close. Back off.
BRODY: Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope
HENDRICKS: Let me. Please.
ELLEN: Hurry, please.
HENDRICKS: What the hell, they can't fire both of us someone's got to be in charge, right? Which way are we going?
BRODY: Find the Kids. The lighthouse you said something about the lighthouse. Get us there.
BRODY: Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol, over.
BRODY: Affirmative. Can you get your chopper 10-4, in a few minutes. He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
PATROL VOICE: 10-4, in a few minutes. He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
BRODY: Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse. Right now.
PATROL VOICE: What for?
BRODY: There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port.
PATROL VOICE: That's it?
BRODY: That's it. Just do it, all right?
PATROL VOICE: 10-4, soon as I can raise him.
BRODY: If they're not at the light, look for them. I don't want them out there. Get them back to port!
PATROL VOICE: ( exasperated ) Affirmative, affirmative. Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port. I heard you. Patrol out.
DONNIE: Starving. Let's go eat now.
DENISE: Starving. Let's go eat now.
DONNIE: ( shouting to Susie ) We're going in to eat!
LARRY: Hey! Brody! Want to race?
MIKE: ( confident ) How about a side bet to make it That's fun! Let's race for something!
LARRY: How about a side bet to make it That's fun! Let's race for something!
JACKIE: That's fun! Let's race for something!
MIKE: Name it.
LARRY: Loser sails home alone.
ANDY: ( aside to Mike ) You're betting what you already got.
MIKE: I don't care.
JACKIE: I love it.
ANDY: Sure you do you win either way.
JACKIE: ( simply ) I'm supposed to.
LARRY: It's a bet. Once around the marker That's the pin the buoy.
MIKE: That's the pin the buoy.
ANDY: ( pulling away ) Turkeys! Eat wind!
MIKE: He pounds with glee on the canvas trampoline as their boat moves ahead, a drumming sound.
UNDERWATER: The twin hulls of a catamaran's hull, the muffled, eerie sound of drumming, as the water carries the tempting "thud- thud-thud" sound down to the deep.
DOUG: Hey! Wait for the H.M.S. Invincible!
BROOKE: Can't we're watching a race!
DOUG: Since when? Who's racing?
TIMMY: Larry and Mike!
LUCY: Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
PATRICK: If we beat them, they can both go home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
LUCY: What about me?
PATRICK: Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in.
LUCY: ( snapping him with a rope ) Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
PILOT: ( filtered, into his mike ) Air Patrol to Base. I have visual contact on the Kids. Going down to use the loud hailer.
THE BOATS: The Kids look at each other, some coming about awkwardly, others luffing, wondering what this is all about.
ANDY: ( to Mike ) Your dad must be really pissed.
MIKE: We better go back in.
ANDY: It's not going to be easy.
JACKIE: What's wrong?
MIKE: We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
ANDY: Putz that won't be for hours.
MIKE: I was counting on hours.

PILOT: Patrol One to Base. Looks like they're turning back.
CONTROL: All right, Patrol. Go back to work. You've wasted enough time.
UNDERWATER: Looking up at the scattered hulls of the sailboats, the turbulence from the low-flying chopper making a vast circular pattern of irregular vibrations.
ELLEN: It's not his boat.
BRODY: It's not his boat.
ELLEN: Be careful.
HENDRICKS: ( on the Sandpiper ) ( he sees something ) Hold on.

DOUG: Oh, shit.
ANDY: Someone pop your balloon?
DOUG: No problem, no problem.
JACKIE: Want a lifesaver?
MARGE: How about a skyhook?
DOUG: You sail your boat, I'll sail mine.
MIKE: Hey, Fetterman You got company.
DOUG: Company? The place is a mess.
DOUG: CUT TO:
DOUG'S BOAT: a distance from the rest. It shakes, then blows up as big teeth grip it from below. Doug goes flying into the drink. The Shark has the inflatable in his teeth, and is shaking it from side to side. Doug's eyes bug out as he sees what's going on. He begins treading water, backing away as fast as he can, waving his arm in the air frantically "pick me up, quick."
MIKE'S BOAT: Doug's down!
MIKE: Doug's down!
ANDY: Doug! This way!
PATRICK: What was that about?
MARGE: You okay?
LUCY: What was that?
LARRY: So much for the rubber duck.
DOUG: A shark ate my boat.
BOB: Come on.
DOUG: I'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate my goddamn boat!
ANDY: If he liked your boat, I got some sneakers he'll love.
KIDS: ( ad lib ) .Jeez what did that?. A porpoise, maybe.Nah, killer whale. I think he snagged it. I hate to pop his balloon. ( Etc. )
CONFUSION: As the following events take place: Larry's red cat rams and locks onto Mike's Tornado. Marge's boat capsizes, putting Sean and Marge into the Marge scrambles up on the over-turned hull, pulling Sean up with her, just in time. Polo, under full sail, scoops Mike out of the water before the Shark can get to him. The Shark dips out of sight.
ANDY: Raft up! Raft 'em up!
LARRY: Tie off to your strongest point.
PATRICK: Anyone need an extra line?
TIMMY: Mike's bleeding!
ANDY: Can you sail?
POLO: ( testing his rudder ) Yeah! We'll take him in!
BRODY: ( on radio ) Amity Launch to Patrol Air Unit One. Harbor Air, where are you?
BRODY: It's me. Any fix on those Kids?
BRODY: For Christ's sake, get going! I'm all alone out here!
BRODY: Where the hell is Francis Shoal?
BRODY: I'm all alone out here.
RUNBY: The Amity Police Boat, under full power, surging through the heavy swell, Brody very much alone at the
BRODY: He puts the wheel over, slewing the boat around. To the left the wrong way.
LARRY: Anyone know what time it is?
DOUG: Larry, Bob, Patrick, and Lucy ( the practiced sailors ) ad lib equal dissatisfaction.
MARGE: Larry, Bob, Patrick, and Lucy ( the practiced sailors ) ad lib equal dissatisfaction.
JACKIE: What's wrong?
BROOKE: Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
DOUG: Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 What'd you do? Memorize the tide I can't help it, it sticks in my Anyone want to play charades?
ANDY: What'd you do? Memorize the tide I can't help it, it sticks in my Anyone want to play charades?
DOUG: I can't help it, it sticks in my Anyone want to play charades?
BROOKE: ( making light of it ) Anyone want to play charades?
PATRICK: As long as we're drifting, might as well go with the flow.
ANDY: Not funny.
PATRICK: Three knot current?
LUCY: At least. And an offshore wind.
SEAN: What's after Cable Junction?
BOB: The Atlantic. Then Ireland.
JACKIE: Can't we stop?
BROOKE: They're probably looking for us.
DOUG: What about the fish?
LARRY: Maybe it's gone.
DOUG: They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
BROOKE: So all we have to do is land at Cable Junction and wait.
PATRICK: First we got to get there.
LARRY: How're we going to do that floating on this garbage.?
BOB: Anyone got another set of sails?
SEAN: Is that big thing still out there?
MARGE: CUT TO:
THE RAFT: More sail, some improvised rigging, Patrick and Lucy trimming what there is, trying to steer the clumsy contraption. From afar, the distant sound of an approaching chopper.
LARRY: ( waving ) Over here! Don't everyone jump around!
BOB: ( waving ) Over here! Don't everyone jump around!
ANDY: Don't everyone jump around!
PILOT: Air One to Base. I have a positive location on that sailing party. Disabled and adrift. .about 3/4 miles west of Cable Junction, wind and current carrying them just about due east. I count ten juveniles.
THE RAFT: The helicopter is creating a lot of turbulence as it sets down, a huge circular pattern of prop-wash on the surface as the rotors slow to a halt. The Kids are waving and jubilant.
PILOT: Everyone okay? Any injuries?
ANDY: Can you put us on Cable Junction?
PILOT: I got no room for passengers.
ANDY: How about a tow? Can you rig that? As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in. My dad's the There's a shark.
LARRY: As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in. My dad's the There's a shark.
ANDY: ( interrupting ) There's a shark.
JACKIE: You have to take us off! You have to! Why don't you take us!
DOUG: ( calming her ) It's an observation spotter, he doesn't have the room.
PILOT: Listen. I'm going to give you an assist to get you on Cable Junction. Then I'll call in, and get the Coast Guard to send a cutter. Hang on to
UNDERWATER: looking up at pontoons, wreckage, wind turbulence on the surface, the heavy "thud-thud-thud" of chopper blades.
THE SHARK: attacks one of the pontoons, biting down on it, clamping great scarred jaws onto the bulbous floats.
THE RAFT: Kids screaming.
QUICK CUTS: Rotor blade spinning wildly. Pilot's hands jerked on the delicate controls. Med. shot, copter shaking. Closeup engine and gas tanks, rotor head spinning. Med. closeup Pilot in buffeting cockpit.
THE KIDS: reacting, ducking in terror. Huge chunks of disintegrating rotors are flying all around. Masts and sails left standing before are chopped into a deadly salad. Screams.
LARRY: Look out!
JACKIE: ( screams )
SHARK ATTACK: The raft shudders, and begins to break up under the pounding. The Kids cling for their lives to masts and wreckage. Marge's overturned hull is struck a fierce blow from beneath.
SEAN: He and Marge topple into the water.
ANDY: Don't struggle!
MARGE: She heaves him up out of the water, hurling him with desperation towards the safety of the floating hull.
THE SHARK: rising like grey doom, then dropping out of sight. Marge is Marge ducking under the bulk of the Shark, shoving off with panicky reserves of strength, swimming away underwater, while the Shark takes a massive crunching bite out of a submerged Follow Marge as she swims.
UNDERWATER: Marge ducking under the bulk of the Shark, shoving off with panicky reserves of strength, swimming away underwater, while the Shark takes a massive crunching bite out of a submerged Follow Marge as she swims.
COPTER WRECKAGE: Huddled in the cracked plastic bubble, the Pilot is sucking air from his oxygen tank. He sees Marge, and slips out of his bubble, headed for her.
MARGE: As the Pilot overtakes her a moment of horror, as she thinks the Shark has found her, then relief, as the Pilot motions to the bubble, and indicates "Air." She follows him.
PATRICK: Sean! Sean!
ANDY: Don't move!
SEAN: Andy! Please help! Help!
BRODY: Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One, come in.
BRODY: Harbor Air, do you read? Over?
PATROL VOICE: Brody? This is Patrol Base.
BRODY: Where the hell is Air One?
PATROL VOICE: That's what I'd like to know. Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
BRODY: Did he raise the Kids?
PATROL VOICE: Last transmission said ten juveniles.
BRODY: Yeah? Then what?
PATROL VOICE: Then nothing. If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report Did you say Cable Junction?
BRODY: Did you say Cable Junction?
PATROL VOICE: That's what he said.
BRODY: PATROL VOICE
PATROL VOICE: 1530 hours. Might still be there. Base out.
LARRY: Sean! Catch the rope!
BOB: The rope! The rope!
PATRICK: He's got to help or it won't work.
LUCY: Sean, baby, please.
JACKIE: It killed her. It ate her.
BROOKE: Shh. Shhh.
DOUG: It's okay, it's okay.
ANDY: Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean.
ANDY: Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear Listen to Andy, Sean.
LUCY: Listen to Andy, Sean.
ANDY: We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
ANDY: ( to Bob ) Keep an eye out for that fish.
LARRY: Throw it.
ANDY: Sean! Catch it!
LUCY: He scrambles out, hardly wet, that's how fast he's moving. Finally Patrick takes the crucial throw, and the rope practically knocks Sean off his perch, but he clutches and holds it. As Andy carefully calls instructions, Sean secures the rope and the others carefully, carefully begin to pull him in.
THE RAFT: With the kids reaching out hands, sticks, rope, anything to pull the little one to safety. The ocean swells rise and fall with hidden menace.
QUICK CUTS: Hands gripping rope. The knot, pulling apart. Anguished faces, concentrating, as Patrick, Lucy, Larry, and Andy struggle to bring him in.
BOB: Cable Junction's ahead!
LUCY: Can we make it?
BOB: I don't know.
THE RAFT: ( to Jackie ) You okay?
LARRY: ( to Jackie ) You okay?
LUCY: ( alone ) Dear Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of God, help us, please. ( her lips move inaudibly )
BROOKE: ( to Doug ) Keep her warm. ( to Jackie ) Jackie? Baby?
PATRICK: Can someone help me rig a jury rudder? We might steer this.
DOUG: By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out. More, with this wind.
LARRY: Shut up.
DOUG: I can't stop thinking!
LUCY: ( praying aloud ) God, please help us, Merciful Father, in Christ's name, we beg you, help us, please, Dear God, save us, help us, please, God, help.
BRODY: Thank Christ.
POLO: Over here! Yo!
BRODY: I'm coming alongside!
BRODY: Mike? Is that you?
MIKE: Pop. I'm sorry.
BRODY: It's okay. What happened?
POLO: A shark hit us out there.
TIMMY: Mike got knocked over.
MIKE: I passed out, but I'm okay.
BRODY: At least you're safe. What about the
BRODY: Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about the others?
MIKE: ( tears in his eyes ) Sean's still out there.
BRODY: He stops in his tracks, radio forgotten. heartsick. Mike goes on,
MIKE: He wanted to come. It was okay, wasn't it? It was okay before.
POLO: The others are ratted together. Which way?
BRODY: Which way?
TIMMY: With the current. Towards Cable
MIKE: Dad, I'm sorry.
BRODY: Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
BRODY: Stay at the lighthouse!
ANDY: Bring her to port a little. That's it steady.
DOUG: I think we're changing course a Can we land on it?
BROOKE: Can we land on it?
LUCY: If we can get to it.
JACKIE: We're going to die.
BROOKE: ( comforting her ) It's all right, we're okay.
ANDY: More to port.
BOB: It's all the way over.
ANDY: Are we going to go on the island?
SEAN: Are we going to go on the island?
BROOKE: You bet, kiddo.
ANDY: ( the realist ) I don't know.
LARRY: What the hell, we're steering for The wind drift is lateral.
DOUG: The wind drift is lateral.
LARRY: What's that mean?
DOUG: Sideways For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way.
LUCY: But we had it! We were headed right for it!
ANDY: Shit. Shit, shit, shit!
JACKIE: We're going to miss it!
ANDY: Stop paddling!
DOUG: Stop paddling!
LUCY: But the island!
ANDY: The Shark.
UNDERWATER: The inverted mast of one of the wrecked boats is snagged on the rocks on the bottom.
BROOKE: What is it?
ANDY: We're hung up on something.
DOUG: Maybe the bottom.
JACKIE: ( hysteria ) It's that thing. It's going to kill us now. We're going to die!
LARRY: Shut up! Just shut Up!
BROOKE: Leave her alone!
BOB: Lighten up, man.
LARRY: It's bad enough without her freaking out.
PATRICK: She's hysterical, goddamn Don't yell at her!
LUCY: Don't yell at her!
LUCY: Wait a minute! Listen! Listen!
BOB: Over there! Coming this way!
THE KIDS: go crazy, waving, yelling, screaming, "Over here!" "Help!"
SEAN: It's Dad!
ANDY: Easy, easy you'll swamp us!
DOUG: Back down!
LARRY: We're hung up here. Snagged.
BOB: Can you get us a line?
DOUG: We got it!
PATRICK: Go ahead, slow.
LUCY: Be careful.
ANDY: Too late. The cleat rips out, Brody's boat leaps forward.
DOUG: Come around again!
ANDY: Hang on, hang on we got it. You're Dad! Help!
SEAN: Dad! Help!
THE SHARK: surfaces, and moves purposefully towards the gap that separates the police boat from the raft. It lunges at Brody as it passes the launch; the fin hits the taut rescue line, snapping it.
BRODY: Hang on!
SEAN: Dad! Dad!
BRODY: I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay. Can you get a line to me?
BRODY: Can you get a line to me?
UNDERWATER: the mast bends under the strain, but holds the raft stuck CABLE JUNCTION - BRODY AND THE KIDS He sees the winch and hooks on his launch, and makes the towline fast to the steel winch cable; puts it in neutral. The Kids haul their line, trying to bring the steel cable to The shark rams their raft, impatient now. Screams and scrambling as they let go their line and try to avoid the beast. Brooke huddles with Sean, Jackie cowers alone. Larry is lashing his big buck knife to a pole, an improvised weapon.
THE KIDS: Get the cable in! Pull!
ANDY: Get the cable in! Pull!
BRODY: Son of a bitch is stuck!
BRODY: climbs back onto the boat, starts the winch engine, trying to pull the cable free.
THE SHARK: on the offensive now, takes an outrigger pontoon, biting it, tearing it off the raft, shaking everything.
DOUG: It's killing us!
JACKIE: I don't want to die! Mommy!
BRODY: Come on, you bastard, come on, pull.
THE RAFT: bursts apart from the center as the Shark lunges up through the canvas trampoline of the Sizzler. The Kids, screaming, fall into the water as the attack forces the fragile structure into pieces. Only Sean, Brooke, and Jackie are left on the remaining segment.
BRODY: Sean! Hang on!
ANDY: Get on the rocks!
DOUG: Swim for it!
PATRICK: Lucy! Look out!
LUCY: I'm bleeding!
BOB: He's clinging to a piece of broken boat; the Shark lunges at INSERT - WINCH grinding, smoking, hauling something out of the water heavy, slimy, dripping metal cable, the main powerline from the mainland!
BRODY: Hang on! Just hang on!
CABLE JUNCTION: Silhouetted against the evening sky. Automatic timers are turning on navigation and worklights, illuminating the barren rocks and rusty steel with their glare throwing dark shadows, putting the surrounding water into black limbo by their contract.
BRODY: I'm coming!
BRODY: Andy! Use the lights! The lights!
ANDY: Where are you? Chief!
BRODY: You bastard!
BRODY: Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!
THE SHARK: lunges at the raft, Brody sliding desperately away, smashing at the snout with his steel, the tail fin bashing him as it ANGLE ON THE STERN OF THE POLICE BOAT Brody is drifting close to the cable, drawn heavy and wet cut of the water. He reaches up to it.
BRODY: Over here! You bastard! Over here
THE SHARK: turns, bleeding from a superficial cut on its snout, its scar glistening wet and terrible. It heads for Brody.
BRODY: Possessed, yelling at the top of his lungs.
BRODY: Come and get me! Come and get me!
THE SHARK: Attacking. Missing Brody, who hauls himself up out of the way in life-or-death spasm. The great jaws close, fastening onto the thick cable. Shaking it. The cable resists for a moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack open, the jaws clamp harder 20,000 tons of pressure then the live copper core is reached. Zap!
THE SHARK: dying. Leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of volts surge through its body, grounded in the salt sea. Hot white fire shimmers like a halo, the fish smokes and stinks, sputters, and dies.
BRODY: watching, cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when the shark hit the cable. It's strangely silent. The lights on Cable Junction flicker and die as circuit breakers shut down the mains, protecting the line. Only the boat's worklights provide light now.
BRODY: No answer. Water lapping at the rocks, some Kids sobbing quietly. Brody listlessly paddles towards the wreckage of the raft, expecting the worst.
SEAN: Brody moves toward him, holds out his arms, taking Sean onto his raft. They paddle back towards the rocks.
THE ISLAND: with the Kids clinging like drowned rats to the rocks; they're wet, scared, exhausted, but safe. Sean hugs his daddy as they step onto land.
SEAN: They made me go with them.
BRODY: Sure they did.
