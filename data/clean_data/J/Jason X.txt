FEMALE VOICE: Careful . . .
MALE VOICE: I know. They take off their masks and goggles. They are both young. ADRIENNE female ( 17 ) watches as STONEY male ( 18 ) studies the object closely.
STONEY: ( reading ) Not guaranteed, if used After 2198. CLOSE UP of the object. It's an unopened condom.
ADRIENNE: ( smiles ) You thinking what I'm thinking? Stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off.
ADRIENNE: ( breathless ) What about Kkinsa? STONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra.
STONEY: It's over between us. You're the only one for me!
STONEY: You okay? Adrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. She turns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder.
FAT LOU: ( yelling over the wind ) Let's go! Time to load up! YLLO( 33 ), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil.
YLLO: ( yelling ) I'm missing two!
FAT LOU: Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
BOEMAN: ( eyes a device ) North three clicks.
BOEMAN: ( yelling ) KICKER( 30 ), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic military garb -
KICKER: Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
YLLO: We're missing two of the kids!
KICKER: Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out. KICKER moves past the group and into the Van.
YLLO: Not without me! The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van.
YLLO: Amazing! But, how . . I've been coming here for ten years. We never picked this up on our . . . KAY-EM? KAY-EM 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil. She's gorgeous, but there's something off about her look. Something synthetic.
THORGAN: Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
KICKER: All right, all right, enough with the history lesson. Lets find these two quick . . so I can kick some little punk ass. Kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.
KKINSA: I have an idea, why don't you go find them and we'll get the hell out of here! KKINSA turns and finds herself face to face with - - A CORPSE! Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled through the forehead by an iron spike.
KKINSA SCREAMS!: Kicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as JANESSA falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. She screams! KAY-EM 14 SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Everyone looks at the droid.
DELONGPREE: Thorgan, have you been screwing with . . . THORGAN grabs the head off the CORPSE, with the spike through it's head.
THORGAN: Cool! This is an automatic "A". Azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some cds, and an ancient box of PLAYTEX . . . starts shoving the corpse into his pack.
AZRAEL: I've got my project. What are you losers gonna do?
KICKER: Back to the shuttle! All of you! I'll find them.
YLLO: Relax, Soldier boy, this is amazing. These remains are two hundred years old. Yllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling. DANGER. STAY OUT.
BOEMAN: Okay, I'm outta here.
THORGAN: Okay, I'm outta here.
KKINSA: Okay, I'm outta here.
YYLO: Kay-Em, any thoughts?
THORGAN: I'm trying to give her some personality.
YLLO: Well stop messing with her. I don't want a science droid with a personality. Now let's find them and get back. I want to get clearance to stay back and study this . . .
KKINSA: No way! I'm not staying here any longer . . . I have a life you know. A radio crackles.
YLLO: ( into radio ) Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found. ( calls out ) Adrienne! Stoney! Yllo rushes past the corpse. The others reluctantly follow. They pass another hanging sign - Danger - THEY PASS ANOTHER CORPSE LYING ON THE FLOOR, it's torso separated from it's legs. And this is just the beginning. As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.
BOEMAN: There was a hall of a battle down here. S they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. A WARNING VOICE sounds.
COMPUTER VOICE: Dan-danger. Do not enter-er. But the group keeps moving.
KKINSA: I feel compelled to ask why we are ignoring that. A corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a warning written in ancient blood . . .
DELONGPREE: What the hell are you two doing?! Kkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney.
YLLO: What the hell are you two doing?! Kkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney.
KKINSA: You're toast, mister.
YLLO: You're both toast!
ADRIENNE: You gotta see this! They turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of a jumbled mess of jagged metal.
THORGAN: ( re: ceiling ) That's a strange design, don't you think?
KICKER: We don't have time for this shit. As they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and squeeze together. That can't be a good thing . . . STONEY and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door. Above the door . . .
DELONGPREE: Yeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year.
ADRIENNE: Check it out. With a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in the door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning -
KKINSA: So don't open the door.
ADRIENNE: Look beyond it, yesterday's news. Yllo pushes his way to the window. Shocked faces. INSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled up into a ball, is a body - female, young.
YLLO: Is that?
YLLO: ( into radio ) Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
KICKER: Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
YLLO: This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way. Yllo turns to the kids. He's very excited.
YLLO: Okay, no screwing around. This is the real thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, open it up. Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.
KKINSA: You're opening the door? What about the . . . ? She points to the skull and crossbones.
DELONGPREE: I'm thinking we should call in some This is your find people. You want to give your credit away?
YLLO: This is your find people. You want to give your credit away?
DELONGPREE: I was just saying . . .
THORGAN: The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
DELONGPREE: Knock you on your ass pal. They don their face masks as . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice crystals crack and fall to the floor.
YLLO: Kay moves into the room ahead of the others.
DELONGPREE: I speak on behalf of the group when I say . . . that's fucked.
YLLO: Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back.
THORGAN: Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back.
KKINSA: What's going on?
DELONGPREE: She's dying.
JANESSA: Bitch looks dead to me. The RADIO CRACKLES . . .
YLLO: Janessa, stretcher. Keep your shirt on, sergeant. We have a medical emergency here not tot mention the discovery of a lifetime.
KICKER: We're outta here! Yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of blood and -CRACK-breaks it off.
YLLO: Fine, grab that end. Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled body on the stretcher.
ANOTHER ANGLE: As thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit -
THORGAN: Hey check this out! Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete.
THORGAN: This caused the leak and there's an Thorgan yanks the door open.
KICKER: Don't touch that! Gas rolls out. Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE.
KKINSA: This is bad, no?
THORGAN: Relax, it's only a glitch in the First field trip and you think you're a Scientist. Move out of the way geek. JANESSA moves to look inside the chamber. As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE, see a jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. A chunk of ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES looms forward! JANESSA screams as JASON'S BODY, stiff as a board, CRASHES to the ground sending ice shrapnel everywhere!
JANESSA: First field trip and you think you're a Scientist. Move out of the way geek. JANESSA moves to look inside the chamber. As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE, see a jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. A chunk of ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES looms forward! JANESSA screams as JASON'S BODY, stiff as a board, CRASHES to the ground sending ice shrapnel everywhere!
DELONGPREE: Jesus, used to make the suckers big didn't they? Again, Kay-Em's eyes scan the frozen body.
YLLO: My God, look at him. Why would they freeze a dead body? Alright, load him up, and let's get out of here!
BACK INSIDE: One of Boeman's gadgets starts to BEEP.
BOEMAN: Er, guy? I'm picking up some movement. FZZZZT . . . Azrael screams as a laser slices into the room. His left arm falls to the ground! Kay-Em rushes to him. Her finger pops open. A needle appears. She injects him. The drugs take immediate effect.
AZRAEL: Cool . . . check out my arm.
HALL: The metallic spiders, lasers attached to their bodies, CLANK towards our Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.
YLLO: Defense droids. I'm on it. Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.
KICKER: Defense droids. I'm on it. Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.
KKINSA: There goes prom night. Kicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm.
KICKER: They're only class two. I can handle this. No problem.
AZRAEL: Not a problem?! Kay-Em injects him again.
AZRAEL: I'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr- Oh, that's dreamy. The lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges.
JANESSA: Okay rent-a-cop, do your shit. I gotta date tonight.
KICKER: Stand back! He pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons.
YLLO: We have to get these two back in one piece! Kay-Em turns to the frozen girl.
YLLO: Kicker! Do something!
ADRIENNE: Oh Gawd! I wish it would stop doing that. At her feet, Azrael's arm twitches spastically.
AZRAEL: ( drugged up ) Kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget.
KAFOOM!: Come on! Kicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear around the bend - towards the exit. A beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view. Behind them - -
KICKER: Come on! Kicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear around the bend - towards the exit. A beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view. Behind them - -
KKINSA: Have I told you guys how much I hate this class?
KICKER: We need another exit! I'll hold 'em off! Teach, find a way out!
BOEMAN: I'm on it!
KICKER: Sorry kid, leave this to the pros.
BOEMAN: ( re: gadget ) Left at the end of the hall! A laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice.
THORGAN: ( reading from device ) They're not after us. Their sensors are locked in on . . . him! Thorgan points to JASON'S STRETCHER.
KICKER: Leave him behind!
YLLO: No! He's coming with us! They round a corner . . .
BOEMAN: Here. We're one meter from the surface!
KICKER: Then duck. CHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling. KABLOOM!! Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above.
DELONGPREE: It's too high! Kicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting!
KICKER: Make it happen!
JANESSA: They're just subclass B droids. I'm so not impressed.
BOEMAN: Stoney, you catch. Stonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very acrobatic move. Boeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step. He begins tossing his friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall! Soon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left.
BOEMAN: We're clear! Let's go! Boeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety. He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker. Kicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand. Boeman strains to pull him up as spider's cover the floor below them, then - A spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's thigh. He screams.
KICKER: They've got me! Let go!
BOEMAN: Boeman ROARS and pulls harder. Kicker's pack RIPS from his body - the spiders falling with the pack.
BOEMAN: That wasn't so bad. Kicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole.
KICKER: ( yells ) This will be! The others dive for the ground as - - KAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole!
THORGAN: Nice touch.
BOEMAN: And you said high school was boring. Our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle. FAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers.
FAT LOU: Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
YLLO: Just get us to the ship! Azrael stops in a panic!
AZRAEL: Oh shit I forgot my arm!
ADRIENNE: Here. Dumbass. She hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp. The door closed, the SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and soars into the EXT. ORBIT AROUND OLD EARTH - LATE THE SHUTTLE maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit. Old satellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc.
FAT LOU: This is Beowulf approaching from sector fifteen. Through the front windshield we see - - GRENDEL, a class IV Catamaran Transport. It looks like two huge torpedoes attached by three thin walkways. Not new, but by no means old.
BRODSKI: What the hell were you thinking? YLLO ignores him, turns to his team.
YLLO: Get them in the lab!
BRODSKI: Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here. The E-X Grunts step in front of kids.
YLLO: ( to the grunts ) Back off!
YLLO: ( back to the kids ) Get them to the labs . . . Now! The team moves through the Grunts.
YLLO: What the hell are you doing? Brodski looks down at the stretcher with the young woman's body on it.
BRODSKI: My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
YLLO: I am an expert!
BRODSKI: You're a teacher.
YLLO: Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
BRODSKI: What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
THORGAN: Sorry . . . I'll fix her . . . I promise.
BRODSKI: How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
YLLO: Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
BRODSKI: Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
YLLO: I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
BRODSKI: I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
YLLO: I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two - The stretcher with JASON moves by them. Brodski looks down.
BRODSKI: Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two - The stretcher with JASON moves by them. Brodski looks down.
BRODSKI: Jesus what the hell is that?
YLLO: That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with. Reluctantly, Brodski steps aside. As the kids follow, Azrael bumps into DALLAS, one of the E-X GRUNTS. Azrael glares at him, brandishing the severed limb.
AZRAEL: Watch it punk, I'm armed.
DALLAS: Dallas slaps Azrael across the back of the head as he passes.
AZRAEL: You'll pay for that. Dallas and the grunts laugh.
BERNIE: Gravitation nominal. Thrusters engaged.
FAT LOU: ( into radio ) Grendel to Grendel's mother, we are enroute.
YLLO: Get her prepped for the soup. Take the other one to lab two.
ADRIENNE: Yllo, this is my find. My project. I want to be in here.
YLLO: I know, dear, but this is too big a discovery. I need you to prep the second But, I want . . .
ADRIENNE: But, I want . . .
YLLO: This is a discovery that we will all share. We have to work as a team. Now go. Stoney go with her. Thorgan and Delongpre lift the Girl onto the rejuvenation table. Stoney whispers something to Kkinsa before he exits with Adrienne. Kkkinsa nods and wheels a huge SCANNING MACHING over to the Girl. She starts the scan as Delongpree and Thorgan cut the clothes off their Have I told you guys how much I love this class? Delongpree brushes some of the melting crystals from her face.
THORGAN: Have I told you guys how much I love this class? Delongpree brushes some of the melting crystals from her face.
DELONGPREE: She's beautiful . . . Thorgan cuts her shirt off.
THORGAN: Damn! Talk about your hard nipples.
ADRIENNE: Fucking Yllo! Thinks he can push me aside. This is my find! She removes chucks of ice from JASON'S FACE.
STONEY: You know even though we both found this guy , I'll let you take the credits. You can take it from here.
ADRIENNE: Oh thanks . . . fine go. It's just another dissection. You'll only get in my way.
STONEY: Cool. Besides, you're into this shit. Stoney leaves Adrienne alone with Jason . . . and he is THAWING.
YLLO: Hands on training is rare. You should consider yourself lucky.
AZRAEL: Azrael sits in a large machine. This is . . . The NANO-TECH 2000. It can repair non-fatal injuries with the use of Azrael is scanned by the NT-2000 and so is his injury. It goes into action as articulated mechanics begin to re-attach his arm.
AZRAEL: Another hour and I'd have lost the arm.
JANESSA: Oh, was that the hand you beat off with?
AZRAEL: I better get extra credit for this shit.
YLLO: Delongpree, Status. How you doing? Delongpree cuts her underpants from her body and tosses them over his I'm Okay.
DELONGPREE: ( swallows hard ) I'm Okay.
STONEY: Well she's definitely a blond.
JANESSA: Oh that's scientific.
DELONGPREE: You think all girls from the past looked this good?
JANESSA: She's not that great.
THORGAN: 400 years . . . I bet she'll be horny.
YLLO: Okay, people, we need to Learn everything there is to learn about our two guests. And if all goes well, I'll mention each one of you when I make my nobel prize speech.
DELONGPREE: ( underbreath ) Yeah, right. Delongpre presses a button on the table. The edges of the table RISE UP to create a clear dome around the table. A hot gel-like substance shoots out of small tubes. The FROZEN BODY is covered in the NANO-GEL. Thorgan checks a monitor.
THORGAN: Everything looks good. Yllo smiles - gushing self-satisfaction.
YLLO: Turn up the heat. Adrienne is wearing a metal eyepiece while staring at a computer screen. No hands.
ADRIENNE: Done. Crystallization remains seventeen percent.
COMPUTER VOICE: Crystallization at sixty percent Subject classification . . . deformity.
ADRIENNE: Put it on the screen. A monitor lights up with a scan of Jason's body. The internal organs are distorted and bloated. She keys into the next lab. Back to lab one.
JANESSA: It's just like Thorgan's. What do you think this means? Thorgan grabs his crotch.
THORGAN: This is what it means right here.
JANESSA: Small brains make your balls itch?
DELONGPRE: And what's with the headgear?
BOEMAN: KAY-EM 14 A medieval sport where two teams club one another with elongated sticks. Very sexy.
YLLO: What do you expect from a culture that sucked its planet dry of resources. She eyes Stoney. He smiles knowingly.
KKINSA: This bores me.
DELONGPRE: She's red. Body temp 98.6. This is so cool.
YLLO: Prep defib and start the cell KAY-EM 14 presses a series of buttons. A long needle punctures the GIRL'S NECK. Jason's scan is replaced by the girl's. We see Nanotechnology going to work replacing her wounds and damaged cells.
THORGAN: Kkinsa and Stoney back out of the room unnoticed.
YLLO: Is she stable?
DELONGPRE: Now what?
YLLO: We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
AZRAEL: Don't I deserve a sick day or some shit like that? Yllo exits.
KKINSA: Adrienne?! Of all people!
STONEY: You're jealous. Stoney moves back. Kkinsa moves close hand raises above her head.
KKINSA: It's over between us. You're the one I want. Kkinsa grabs the back of her shirt and pulls it over her head.
STONEY: It's over between us. You're the one I want. Kkinsa grabs the back of her shirt and pulls it over her head.
KKINSA: A bed slides out from the wall, hitting Stoney in the back of the legs, causing him to fall on the bed. Kkinsa straddles him. Stoney grabs her. The two fall into a feverish kiss.
ADRIENNE: Prepare organ vats. Two metal sinks hiss as liquid nitrogen flows.
ADRIENNE: Okay big boy . . . She picks up a long, sharp chrome tool and walks over to Jason's body.
ADRIENNE: ( continuing ) . . . let's see what you're made of.
JANESSA: All this science shit, makes me horny. Take off your cloths, we don't have much She drops her shirt to the floor. Yllo retrieves it, hands it back.
JANESSA: You're quicker than usual.
YLLO: You prefer an apple? He forces her into the hall, closes the door, locks it. He returns to the console.
JANESSA: You prefer an apple? He forces her into the hall, closes the door, locks it. He returns to the console.
YLLO: ( to console ) Secure line. Perez, Joshua, Solaras Space Lab. Connect.
PEREZ: You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
YLLO: We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found. Yllo inserts a disk into the console.
YLLO: I'm sending you the files.
PEREZ: ( testy ) Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
YLLO: Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
PEREZ: ( begins download ) Alright, I'm . . . ( reacts to file ) No way . . . is this a joke? Yllo smiles.
YLLO: Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
YLLO: I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
KKINSA: How bad do you want it? Stoney gets his arms free and rolls on top of her.
ADRIENNE: Interesting. Record. Thawing has caused possible muscle spasms. She frowns at the disgusting ooze. A mixture of swamp waters, blood, and other thawing bodily fluids, puddle around Jason's body. She moves back to her work station and picks up JASON'S BLOATED EYE. She takes out an autopsy laser and cuts through the center of the eye. The laser slices through the fatty tissue as thick black goop drips out of the eye. Adrienne stares into a microscope. This is all very INT. STONEY'S CABIN Stoney lies on top of Kkinsa.
KKINSA: Yes . . . yes . . . that's it! . . . a moment, then both GASP as he enters her.
THORGAN: Anybody seen the reticulator?
DELONGPRE: Try next door, there was one there Thorgan exits.
THORGAN: Wakey wakey love birds . . . Yllo's gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling around instead of working. Thorgan roots through a drawer, his back to the glass.
ANTE ROOM: Through the glass beside him we see Adrienne screaming. But NO SOUND. All rooms are air tight. Her head is smashed on the glass! Still screaming, her face recedes back into the darkness as Thorgan looks over his shoulder.
THORGAN: Bye, lovebirds . . . Stoney, you dog. He exits.
JASON'S BACK!: EXT. LAB ONE CORRIDOR Jason walks into the corridor from LAB TWO, steam still rising from his cold body. He heads away from LAB ONE as soon as he's out of sight, YLLO INT. LAB ONE Delongpre wakes as Yllo enters.
YLLO: All right, lets do this. Thorgan begin the Defib program, Delongpre, ready the drainage units. Boerman get the others in here. Boeman grabs a wall mike.
KKINSA: No shit, we've got a heart beat!
STONEY: Hell yeah I'm coming!
KKINSA: No . . . not yet!
STONEY: YES !!! NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! YES!!! Stoney, put your pants on and get your ass down here! They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door. Stoney hits the door release and the door SWISHES open revealing - -
YES !!!: NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! YES!!! Stoney, put your pants on and get your ass down here! They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door. Stoney hits the door release and the door SWISHES open revealing - -
KKINSA: NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! YES!!! Stoney, put your pants on and get your ass down here! They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door. Stoney hits the door release and the door SWISHES open revealing - -
STONEY: BOEMAN( V.O. ) Stoney, put your pants on and get your ass down here! They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door. Stoney hits the door release and the door SWISHES open revealing - -
YES!!!!!!: BOEMAN( V.O. ) Stoney, put your pants on and get your ass down here! They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door. Stoney hits the door release and the door SWISHES open revealing - -
JASON VOORHEES!: Standing in the hall. He swings the silver cleaver. Stoney sidesteps as Kkinsa SCREAMS. Stoney SLAMS his palm into the door panel. The door SWISHES to close but Jason's hand reaches out and stops ENGINES WINE as JASON STRUGGLES to force the door open. Stoney keeps POUNDING the panel, trying to make the door close but Jason's too strong! Jason grabs Stoney by the arm, jerks him into the doorway and releases the door. The door closes! Splitting Stoney from forehead to crotch! Splashed with blood, Kkinsa falls to the floor cowering . . . mumbling nonsensically.
YLLO: It's time.
DELONGPRE: What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
YLLO: I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do. Kay presses buttons. We hear the whine of something powering up . . . Brodski enters the lab.
YLLO: What the hell are you doing?
BRODSKI: My job.
YLLO: Fine, just stay out of my way. Hit it. An electrical noise flares THE SCREEN TO WHITE:
GIRL'S VOICE: Mom! Dad! It's loose! He's loose! The door swishes open revealing the dead bodies of a couple in their CLOSE ON THE GIRL We recognize her as the frozen girl. Her name, RIZZO ( 18 ), pretty. She screams. Turns.
HER POV: Standing at the end of the corridor, back lit and ominous is JASON VOORHEES! He marches towards her. She runs. Snatches a headset from a wall mount.
RIZZO: Help me! Anyone! Somebody help me! STATIC from the radio. Jason closing. She reaches down and grabs a shot gun from a dead Security Guard. Chick- chick. KABLAM! Jason keeps coming. She runs. As she rounds a corner, we see - -
CRYOGENICS LAB: She opens the door and enters the cold room. Slips on the wet frozen ground, nearly falls. ON JASON as he rounds the corner, sees the open door.
RIZZO: You son of a bitch! KABLAM! Jason slides backwards on the slick floor. KABLAM! Further, he nearly falls. KABLAM! He stumbles, falls backwards into the cryo-unit. Rizzo slams her palm onto a console, the Cryo-unit door closes, JASON
COMPUTER VOICE: Cryo-Unit activated. Slowly the unit goes silent, still. Rizzo stares at it, approaches slowly, staring at the fogging glass -
COMPUTER VOICE: Cryo-Unit leak. Lock down in progress. Security measures on line.
RIZZO: She rushes toward the door. It won't budge.
RIZZO: Somebody! No!
CHSHSHSHSHSH!: Gas filters into the room from the leak in the Cryo-Unit.
COMPUTER VOICE: Subject in computer unit has reached full incubation. Rizzo begins to fade. She stumbles.
RIZZO: No . . . Cryo gas rolls along the floor . . . As blood pours from her wound, she reaches her bloody hand to the glass window and draws -
THORGAN: That one did it! Yllo moves close to Rizzo.
YLLO: We should expect a moment of WHAM! Rizzo punches Yllo in the nose.
DELONGPRE: Spunky . . .
YLLO: She broke my fucking nose!
BRODSKI: I like her already.
RIZZO: Where..? Who . . .? I'm alive. You brought me back.
YLLO: ( rubbing his nose ) Obviously so. Rizzo looks down at her body, gel dripping off her naked flesh.
RIZZO: What the hell is this shit? Delongpre gives her a blanket. She covers herself.
RIZZO: How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
YLLO: Nano.but nanotechnology is impossible.
RIZZO: Nano.but nanotechnology is impossible.
YLLO: We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
RIZZO: 30? How long was I out? Rizzo finally takes a good look at where she is. Something is very wrong in her world.
YLLO: The year is 2455. You've been frozen for the past four hundred years. Rizzo gasps a shocking revelation.
YLLO: Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some JASON?! WHERE IS HE?! The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
RIZZO: JASON?! WHERE IS HE?! The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
THORGAN: The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
RIZZO: Hockey player? He's not a .
THORGAN: He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
RIZZO: Old Earth?
YLLO: We need to do some tests.I'd like to ask you a few questions.
RIZZO: But.I.400 years?
YLLO: That's right, now if you could. Delongpre frowns at Yllo and moves to Rizzo.
DELONGPRE: It can wait. Let's get you cleaned up. Delongpre helps Rizzo off the table.
YLLO: Wait a minute.I need.
BRODSKI: Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
DELONGPRE: Come on.
RIZZO: Delongpre comes through the door with a plate of food.
DELONGPRE: I thought that after 400 hundred years, you just might have a little bit of an appetite. He puts the food on a small table and moves to the window.
DELONGPRE: You're on Grendel, a class IV Catamaran It's basically a school bus. We're on our way back to Earth II. It's finals week. She turns back to the window.
RIZZO: You're telling me I'm a friggen class project? Delongpre flinches, expecting to be hit.
DELONGPRE: ( a beat ) Sort of. I mean, no, not really . She collapses onto the bed.
DELONGPRE: I'll give you a moment alone. Do you want me to come get you when we start the dissection? Rizzo shrugs. She's lost everyone and everything. She's lot 400 years. Delongpre backs out of the room, closing the door behind him. Rizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes. She reaches into the pocket of her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys. The key chain holds a picture.a picture of her parents. She sits on the bed and starts to cry.
YLLO: She needs a little time.
DELONGPRE: She needs a little time.
YLLO: More time.shit, she's had 400 years. Yllo laughs at his own joke.
DELONGPRE: That's really funny.
YLLO: I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
DELONGPRE: Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
RIZZO: Jason? He's on this ship?!
YLLO: Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years.except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking. He's a stiff. You'll get the Are you finished? Yllo nods then
RIZZO: ( glares ) Are you finished? Yllo nods then
WHAM!: Rizzo punches him again.
YLLO: God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
DELONGPRE: Oh I like her a lot.
BRODSKI: I'm with you kid.
RIZZO: Where is he?
BRODSKI: ( points ) Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
RIZZO: No, you're dead! You're all dead! She shoves Delongpre out of the way and out the door.
YLLO: Oh my God! Adrienne?
JANESSA: Oh my God! Adrienne?
THORGAN: What have you done?
RIZZO: What have I done?! Idiots. Thorgan throws up.
BOEMAN: ( into a mike ) Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
DELONGPRE: Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
RIZZO: I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that Maybe she tripped. Brodski and Kicker burst into Lab Two, they react to the carnage.
JANESSA: Maybe she tripped. Brodski and Kicker burst into Lab Two, they react to the carnage.
BRODSKI: Jesus, God!
KICKER: Oh man, what the hell happened?
RIZZO: Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
YLLO: Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
RIZZO: I didn't say he was alive.
STALKING POV: Something watching Azrael, his back to us. Azrael moves. The stalker closes in. Suddenly Azrael hits, rolls and comes up Blasting right at us.
HIS POV: A HUGE ALIEN CREATURE, fangs, claws and so on, leaps at him. THe big blaster hits home. The alien DISINTERGRATES. Sitting on the floor, Azrael sighs and wipes his brow. SUddenly, another alien rises up behind him with a hideos Screech. There's nothing Azrael can do. He's a goner. Then FZZT! A blast from elsewhere DISINTERGRATES THE CREATURE. MOVE TO
REVEAL: DALLAS, the grunt Azreael had words with earlier.
DALLAS: That's nine to four, geek-boy.
AZRAEL: You got lucky.
DALLAS: You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
AZRAEL: Speaking of which, duck! Dallas hits the deck as Azrael FIRES, disintegrating another. Beyond it lunge a half dozen more. Dallas and Azrael scramble to their feet, take aim, when
AZRAEL: What the?!
JASON VOORHEES: SLASHES THROUGH another alien, splitting it down the middle. Then another.
DALLAS: He's good. Azrael smiles knowingly. He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason. Aliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on. Dallas joins in unloading on the hulinking terror. THeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever.
DALLAS: That sucks. Why won't he go down?
AZRAEL: Pause play. Suddenly the aliens freeze in place. Jason stares at them, then turns to Dallas and Azrael.
DALLAS: He's not part of the program.
AZRAEL: Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life. Jason walks up to them. Titls his head like a dog hearing a high-pitched Why aren't they running.
AZRAEL: Hey! We're playing a game here. Get off the court! Jason raises his silver blade high.
DALLAS: No, we're playing a game.not you numbnuts. SLASH! The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his rib cage. Blood spurts as his right side pulls away from his body. Azrael does not seem hurt, only pissed.
AZRAEL: Asshole that does not count as a kill.
DALLAS: Yes it does.
AZRAEL: Oh, come on! JASON is confused. He spins and slashed taking Dallas' head clean off. The head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks.
DALLAS: Okay, enough of this shit.
AZRAEL: Alright, asshole. The sound of an ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN. Jason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court, all white, No creatures, no Dallas or Azrael. A both ends of the white garganuan room we see a small tinted glass. Azrael's voice booms over a loud speaker.
DALLAS: I don't have all day, kid.
AZRAEL: Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on. Jason stares at the tinted glass of Azrael's booth.
AZRAEL: ( into mike ) Lab.this is AZ in the game grid. Your guy got out and runined our game.
YLLO: Azrael can you repeat that?
RIZZO: Get him out of there!
AZRAEL: ( into mike ) I said the guy in the mask is in here ruining our game. Jason starts to close in on Azrael's pod.
AZRAEL: ( continuing ) Send someone to the grid to pick him up. He looks lost.
YLLO: That's impossible.
RIZZO: I told you! Get them out of there! Get out of there! Get out of there now!
AZRAEL: ( into mike ) All right fine, we'll head back Suddenly, JASON shoves his fist through the glass.
DALLAS: The sounds of Azrael's DEATH broadcast over the lab. When Jason retrieves his hand, he holds a bloody mass of Azrael's IN THE LAB, Brodski takes charge.
BRODSKI: Dallas! That you? Come back!
DALLAS: ( into mike ) Sarge! Get the fuck down here! We got a real shitstorm in the DALLAS fights to get out of his virtual reality suit and get himself into combat mode.BUT. JASON hears the movement. Turns, flings his silver blade. It flies across the room, throught the glass and impales Dallas' throat to his chair. The blade shrots out the electronics in the grid and plunges the room to INT. LAB TWO As the connection goes to static.
BRODSKI: ( into mike ) Dallas?! Dallas?! Do you copy? Nothing. Finally.
RIZZO: He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
BRODSKI: Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on! She gets up and heads for the door.
DELONGPRE: Where are you going?
RIZZO: We have to get off this ship. Yllo who has been losing control takes on the lead again.
YLLO: That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
RIZZO: Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
BRODSKI: I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
RIZZO: Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship. and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
DELONGPRE: You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad.and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
RIZZO: I hope so.
KICKER: Damn. Are they playing?
SVEN: Dallas?! Azrael! Their combat sense perks up a bit. Something's not right. They turn on their lights and ready their weapons.
SVEN: Oh shit. From inside pod as Sven and Kicker approach. THe blood splattered inside the glass glows in the throws of their lights. Kicker breaks off to inspect the other POD Sven tries to hold down his Sarge, this is bad. The kid's His guts are ripped out.
SVEN: Sarge, this is bad. The kid's His guts are ripped out.
BRODSKI: ( over radio ) Oh yeah. Kicker reaches the other POD. the darkness looms behind him as he finds his friend.
SVEN: Oh yeah. Kicker reaches the other POD. the darkness looms behind him as he finds his friend.
KICKER: ( into radio ) Sarge, this is Kicker. Dallas got it to. Real slice and dice. What should we do?
BRODSKI: Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
KICKER: Roger that. Time to kick some ass! From behind him a shape materializes. A hand reaches out of the KICKER JUMPS! Spins around with his weapon at the ready!
IT'S SVEN!: Don't friggen do that!
SVEN: Don't friggen do that!
KICKER: Don't friggen do that!
BRODSKI: Yllo, what's your head count?
YLLO: Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
JANESSA: You know, Stoney's done everyone on this trip but me..what's up with that? Brodski scans the room - a tactical assessment.
BRODSKI: This place should be safe. Get them back here. I don't want to be hunting around and kill one of your kids by accident. As much as I've dreamed of doing that. Brodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin.
BRODSKI: I need to know what you know about this guy.
RIZZO: Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
BRODSKI: Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down. Rizzo shakes her head. She can't get through to this guy.
BRODSKI: I've been a grunt for fifteen years. There's not a problem I can't fix with enough ammunition. Yllo is getting no response.
YLLO: Stoney! Stoney if you can hear me, get your ass down to the lab immediately! I'm going to see if I can find them. Yllo opens the door and Kkinsa is there! Half-naked, covered in blood. Janessa SCREAMS and the others gasp. Kkinsa falls to the floor..whimpering, in shock. Boeman rushes over to her with a blanket.
KKINSA: Sstoney's dead! They all look to each other, searching for what to say or do.Rizzo puts her head in her hands.not again.
YLLO: ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
BRODSKI: Not a chance.
YLLO: JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
BRODSKI: You got that right. They arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM.
YLLO: This thing could be worth a great deal.. scientifically.not to mention what the fat cats on Earth II would pay for it! Look, I'll split it with you 50/50. The door opens. The E-X Grunts are all there. Weapons in a rack on one wall. They are in various states of battle dresss. Yllo follows Brodski in. Brodski turns and faces him, his men behind.
BRODSKI: You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that.that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
KICKER: Fuckin A.
BRODSKI: Now get out of our way.get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats. we've got a job to do!
YLLO: That bastard! Boemen turn on the tracking monitors. Rizzo walks over to Kay-em 14. Thorgon is working on her.
RIZZO: Robot huh?
RIZZO: Barbie from hell.
RIZZO: Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie.
RIZZO: I'm surrounded by idiots.
THORGON: Sorry, I'm working on it.
DELONGPRE: Are all twenty-first century girls like you?
RIZZO: He'll kill us all. You know that, don't you?
THORGON: ( re:monitor ) There's been an unauthorized entrance to the Cargo Bay.
BRODSKI: Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
YLLO: ( into the mic ) At least try to get him alive.will ya Brodski? I'll try.
BRODSKI: Alright, the teach requests we take this guy out at the knees. I say shoot to kill. The boys fidget with excitment. Bout time they see some action.
BRODSKI: So after you've killed him, put one in his knee so we can say we tried. The men LAUGH and high five.
BRODSKI: Go to infrared, stay in radio contact. Teach you there?
YLLO: Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
YLLO: Yeah yeah. Got it. Yllo removes his head set and quickly turns to a separate console. He has his own agenda.
BRODSKI: Let's move out. The doors HISS open.
BRODSKI: Two teams, Port, starboard. They split up.
THORGAN: Each blip represents a trained killer. It's men like that fought off the pirates on Earth II, battled Jauntuns on the solar For the moment, Rizzo looks distantly hopeful.
RIZZO: So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
THORGAN: INT. CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE Briggs and Geko move side by side. Condor brings up the rear. Suddenly he is jerked out of view. CLOSE ON CONDOR'S FACE, jason's hand around his throat. SNAP. The eyes go dead, the neck broken.
RIZZO: WHAT'S IT MEAN WHEN ONE OF YOUR BLIPS All eyes turn to the schematic as one of the blips FLICKERS and FADES.
DISAPPEARS?: All eyes turn to the schematic as one of the blips FLICKERS and FADES.
BOEMAN: ( into mic ) Sergeant, this is Boemen.
BRODSKI: Briggs, Geko, talk to me!
BRIGGS: He was.he was right here!
BRODSKI: DAMNIT to hell! We're coming to you!
THORGAN: You see that?
BOEMAN: Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed INT. CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE Got it. BRIGGS and GEKO split up, moving around a large metallic tank.
BRIGGS: Got it. BRIGGS and GEKO split up, moving around a large metallic tank.
BRIGGS: I don't see anything.
BRIGGS: That's GEKO. mAYBE you kids should stay out of this. Briggs removes his gogles only to find Jason standing before him, holding Geko's body.impaled onto his silver blade. BRIGGS fires.screams.
THORGAN: ( turns ) Jesus, is this what it was like on your. Rizzo is cowering on the floor, her hands over her ears. She's sweating, Sergeant, you've lost two more men! INT. CARGO BAy - PORTSIDE Brodski and his remaining men double-time-it to the slaughter. Briggs and Geko lie dEAD
BOEMAN: Sergeant, you've lost two more men! INT. CARGO BAy - PORTSIDE Brodski and his remaining men double-time-it to the slaughter. Briggs and Geko lie dEAD
KICKER: Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
BRODSKI: Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
YLLO: Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
YLLO: We've got a situation here! Just do as you're told!
YLLO: Thank you. Yllo disconnects, and turns to the other console.
YLLO: ( into mic ) Ok Sarge, what's your status?
YLLO: But I didn't see.
GUNFIRE ERUPTS!: SVEN( V.O. ) I got him! I got him!
THORGAN: Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
RIZZO: Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
BOEMAN: Duck fuckers?
RIZZO: He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
DELONGPRE: Outta here?
RIZZO: Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? There's a shuttle.
THORGON: There's a shuttle.
RIZZO: Alright, been nice knowing you. Who's with me?
KKINSA: I'll go.
BOEMEN: Yllo said stay here.
KKINSA: Fuck Yllo!
BOEMEN: They got him! You're not leaving!
SVEN: Big sucker too. Suddenly, Jason reaches up, grabs the back of Sven's head and SLAMS it into his mask. Sven's forehead shatters.
ON BRODSKI: As he races around a crate. Sven's body is within sight. His killer nowhere to be seen.
BRODSKI: Kicker? Where are you? Elsewhere we hear GUNFIRE followed closely by a SCREAM!
ELSEWHERE: Kicker crawls across the floor, blood spews from his mouth.
RIZZO: Do something!!!
THORGON: Don't look at me! I'm in high school!
BRODSKI: Find Crutch! Set up an ion field around the cargo bay. We'll torch the sucker! Yllo.you're a dead man! Brodski races toward the Cargo exit.
ON MONITOR: We see Brodski racing towards us. We also see Jason, lying in wait, hidden by one of the crates.
YLLO: ( stops ) Yllo considers then.
BRODSKI: ( stops ) Yllo considers then.
YLLO: On the monitor we see Brodski move forward. He never saw Jason coming. BRODSKI SCREAMS. Yllo turns his head.
RIZZO: Lesson number one, kiddies. You wanna get home safely then we get off this boat. Kkinsa starts t cry.
KKINSA: I don't understand.what does he want?
RIZZO: He wants to kill you.and me.and everyone on this ship. Rizzo looks at everyone.
RIZZO: Any questions? A side door HISSES OPEN. Yllo enters.
YLLO: You're not going anywhere.
RIZZO: You wanna die?
YLLO: ( ignores her ) Are we locked down?
BOEMAN: That door's the only way in or out and it won't open without the code.
YLLO: Then we wait. We're docking with Space Lab in less than an hour.
RIZZO: What good will that do?
YLLO: They can deal with this sort of thing.
RIZZO: More soldiers?
YLLO: Scientists. Very intellegent men.
RIZZO: That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
JANESSA: Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
YLLO: Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
RIZZO: ( to kids ) Guys, please come with me!
YLLO: 4You're not going anywhere. Rizzo starts for the door but Yllo grabs her arms, holds them behind Now hold on! We should hear her out!
DELONGPRE: Now hold on! We should hear her out!
THORGAN: She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
YLLO: Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
DELONGPRE: No shit. I got no problem with that. Janessa readies a hypo.
THORGAN: Maybe if we knew a little bit more about what we're delaing with here. Janessa moves behind Rizzo with the sedative. Suddenly Rizzo throws her head back, Salmming it into Yllo's nose. He CRIES OUT in pain. Janessa lunges with the syringe but Rizzo snatches her wrist, grabbing the hypo, burying it into Janessa's left breast.
RIZZO: Janessa collapses. Yllo rushes Rizzo again, but this time Boeman stands, blocks his path.
CRUTCH: Leave her be.
RIZZO: Ok, who do I gotta fuck to get off this boat? Thorgan timidly raises his hand.
RIZZO: Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
THORGAN: Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there. Rizzo rushes the door. There's a code box on the wall.
RIZZO: How do you open the damn door?
YLLO: You're crazy! Kkinsa punches in the code. The door HISSES open.
DELONGPRE: Rizzo, he's out there.
RIZZO: Yeah and he'll be here soon enough. Last chance. The others stare at her. She's crazy.
RIZZO: Fine. Bye. She and Kkinsa exit, the door SWISHES CLOSED behind them.
YLLO: ( favoring his nose ) Pack your shit. We'll disembark in an hour. The guys at Space Lab have the necessary equipment to contain this thing and then we can study it. But the kids aren't so sure.
YLLO: Computer on line. A series of beeps.
YLLO: ( jumps ) Jesus! Can't you knock? ( back to console ) Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
COMPUTER VOICE: Power to Beowulf disengaged.
YLLO: ( to Janessa ) She's too valuable. She's not leaving this ship.
FAT LOU: Disengage auto-pilot.
BERNIE: FAT LOU New COURSE, seven-eighty-one.
FAT LOU: New COURSE, seven-eighty-one.
BERNIE: On course. ETA 36 minutes, 34 seconds.
FAT LOU: Engage auto pilot. Suddenly, Bernie is ripped from his chair! Electricity SHOOTS through the console as Bernie's DIALOG becomes jibberish.
BERNIE: Fat Lou stares up in shock just before JASON SLAMS Bernie's torso ontop of her.
RIZZO: Which way? Kkinsa points. They head in that direction. Then Rizzo suddenly stops.
KKINSA: Rizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates.
RIZZO: Rizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates.
RIZZO: He's in here. Kkinsa opens her mouth to scream. Rizzo slaps her hand over Kkinsa's You scream I'll snap your neck. Got it? Kkinsa nods. Rizzo releases her.
RIZZO: You scream I'll snap your neck. Got it? Kkinsa nods. Rizzo releases her.
KKINSA: ( whispers ) How do you know?
RIZZO: ( dread ) I just know.
YLLO: We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
DELONGPRE: I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
YLLO: Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
DELONGPRE: Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this At least we'll be safe.
YLLO: They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the shuttle. The kids and Crutch stare at him. Cold hearted.
RIZZO: Open the doors. Kkinsa punches in a series of buttons. Nothing.
KKINSA: Something's wrong.
RIZZO: Keep trying!
YLLO: Everyone ready? Yllo grabs a mike from a console.
YLLO: Fat Lou, what's the ETA?
YLLO: Lou, goddamjnit! Bernie, where's Lou?!
ON MONITOR: We see the view from the bridge security camera. Lots of blood and the mangled combination of Lou and Bernie.
THORGAN: We're screwed.
DELONGPRE: We're screwed.
YLLO: The ship doesn't need pilots to dock. We'll disembark and you'll see. Everything will be fine.
BOEMAN: Uh.that's gonna be a problem. The ship's not on auto-pilot. We're flying blind. Thirty minutes till impact. All eyes turn to Yllo, for guidance, his back to the outer door.
YLLO: I guess.we'll have to go to the bridge.
THORGAN: Jason is out there. Then
RIZZO: Damnit, he's got them. Kkinsa keeps trying the code box. Nothing.
KKINSA: Rizzo, I think Yllo must have done something. The door won't open.
YLLO: It's alright. He can't get in here! WHAM! WHAM!!! But the door is starting to give. Through the confusion, Crutch moves to one of the consoles. Clicks away at the keyboard.
KKINSA: The power's back up!
RIZZO: Then open the doors!
KKINSA: Thirty seconds.
JANESSA: What do we do?!!
YLLO: Help me up. Boeman helps Crutch to the top of a table. Crutch goes to work on a vent, removing screws.
CRUTCH: Help me up. Boeman helps Crutch to the top of a table. Crutch goes to work on a vent, removing screws.
JANESSA: Okay, I'm guessing you should hurry. The top corner of the door bends.Jason peers through.
THORGAN: Jesus, tell this asshole I don't play hockey!
CRUTCH: Our group starts climbing the table and into the ceiling space.
YLLO: Will that take us to the bridge?
CRUTCH: It's a maze up there, but yes.
YLLO: We'll engage auto-pilot! Everything'll be fine! With that, the door gives! Boeman heaves Crutch into the crawl space then follows himself. Jason staring at Kay-Em
YLLO: Move it people! Then Yllo screams. Jason has him from below. Boeman grabs his arms.
BOEMAN: Help me! DeLongpre grabs hold and pulls. Suddenly Yllo is jerked out of their grasp. They fall onto their backs breathing heavily.
YLLO: Now hold on! Have you considered how valuable you are? Credit, fame, you can have it all. And ladies. I mean, how long has it been? Jason stands there, but his attention isn't on Yllo. It's on the machete sticking through Yllo's belt. Jason reaches for it. Yllo backs into a wall. Jason slowly removes the machete from Yllo's belt and stares at it. He the cleaver to the ground.
YLLO: ( chuckles ) That's all you wanted?
RIZZO: ( knowingly ) Yllo screams.
DELONGPRE: GO, GO, GO! They race down the walkway, over huge pipes and through electrical wires, Crutch in the lead.
KKINSA: Rizzo, come on! But, Rizzo hesitates. We can still hear the PANICKED SCREAMS over the He's right behind us!
RIZZO: ( to Kkinsa ) Close the door! I'll be right back.
KKINSA: ( panicked ) I gotta go back.
RIZZO: I gotta go back.
KKINSA: Rizzo turns and races through the maze of boxes and crates leaving Kkinsa nearly INT. CELING WALK SPACE Crutch comes to a fork in the walkway.
CRUTCH: Okay, we need to .
BOEMAN: You forgot didn't you, you old At the back of the line, Delongpre turns as Jason rounds the bend behind Shit! Move it! He's coming! Delongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan
DELONGPRE: Shit! Move it! He's coming! Delongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan
DELONGPRE: Racing forward the group stays just out of Jason's grasp. Leaping over and under and through whatever blocks the path.
DELONGPRE: Jason swings his machete at DeLongpre! It just misses him.
DELONGPRE: Crutch comes to ascreened panel. Boeman kicks it open. They leap down onto a catwalk crossing the
FASTER!!!: Crutch comes to ascreened panel. Boeman kicks it open. They leap down onto a catwalk crossing the
HER POV: the group races across the catwalk as Json leaps down behind them.
DELONGPRE: He's right on my ass! Then Jason grabs Delongpre, who screams.
RIZZO,: spots a gun left by one of the marines. She snatches it, points it Jason and Delongpre then aims a little high.
FZZZT!: It slices through a metal cord holding the catwalk to the ceiling. The catwalk jerks. Everyone tumbles. Jason loses his grip on Delongpre. Suddenly, METAL SCREECHES, as the catwalk gives under the weight. It RIPS in half,dumping both heroes and Jason. RIZZO dives out of the way as a pile of metal and bodies crash to the Janessa sits up rubbing her head.
JANESSA: That was fun. Kay-Em 14 sits up, sings.
JANESSA: I didn't do it. The fall scattered her programming..wait. Where's? Shit! He's lying on top of Jason. He scrambles to his feet. But Jason doesn't Hey, I think the fall killed him. The group slowly gathers around. Jason sits up and swings at Thorgan. Boeman pulls him out of the way just in time. Jason starts to stand when RIZZO comes up behind him. KA-FWAM! She brings the barrel of a high tech gun down on the top of Jason's head. He collapses. The surrounded faces look happily suprised.
THORGAN: I didn't do it. The fall scattered her programming..wait. Where's? Shit! He's lying on top of Jason. He scrambles to his feet. But Jason doesn't Hey, I think the fall killed him. The group slowly gathers around. Jason sits up and swings at Thorgan. Boeman pulls him out of the way just in time. Jason starts to stand when RIZZO comes up behind him. KA-FWAM!

THORGAN: Hey, I think the fall killed him. The group slowly gathers around. Jason sits up and swings at Thorgan. Boeman pulls him out of the way just in time. Jason starts to stand when RIZZO comes up behind him. KA-FWAM! She brings the barrel of a high tech gun down on the top of Jason's head. He collapses. The surrounded faces look happily suprised.
RIZZO: Trust me, it's temporary. Boeman takes the gun from Rizzo.
BOEMAN: Better let me.
THORGAN: Where'd you get the gun? Rizzo gestures at what's left of Geko's body.
CRUTCH: The bridge is this way! They take off running.
RIZZO: Everyone stops, turns
RIZZO: Forget the bridge, the shuttle's What do you mean, not enough time?
BOEMAN: ( to Kay-Em ) What do you mean, not enough time?
JANESSA: I think your metal lover's losing it.
DELONGPRE: Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
RIZZO: Guys!!! The shuttle? The kids look at one another as if this were a stroke of genius.
RIZZO: This way! Crutch again leads them through the maze. Delongpre stops at another Grunt body, removes a chain gun. THorgan takes a high tech laser from another.
CRUTCH: This way! Crutch again leads them through the maze. Delongpre stops at another Grunt body, removes a chain gun. THorgan takes a high tech laser from another.
THORGAN: I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
DELONGPRE: Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
CRUTCH: ( jokingly ) Just around this bend. Jason steps out in front of Crutch, his machete held poised in front of Crutch runs right up onto the blade.
BOEMAN: Alrhoguh he's meat on a stick, Crutch doesn't give up. He SLAMS his fists into Jason's torso. Thorgan turns to fire Boeman KNOCKS the barrel high.
BOEMAN: You'll hit crutch! Boeman tosses his weapon to Janessa and leaps on Jason's back, locking his arms around his neck.
RIZZO: What are you doing? You can't save him! Delongpre smashes the back of Jason's knee with the chaingun. Jason topples on top of Boeman. Crutch is thrown free. Janessa and Thorgan help Crutch to his feet as Jason sees Rizzo for the first time in 400 hundred years. It's either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge. He leaps to his feet and races towards her.
RIZZO: Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
DELONGPRE: ( to Jason ) No you don't!
BRAAAAAAATTTT!: The chaingun dances Jason backwards. He CRASHES through the side of one of the cargo boxes. EVERYONE STOPS.
RIZZO: Don't stop! She jerks the gun from Delongpre and races to the crate.
RIZZO: You never stop when he's down! But the crate is empty.
RIZZO: They spin around, searching.
CRUTCH: ( weak ) Forget him. Come on. Carrying Crutch, they move toward the shuttle bay.
BOEMAN: Kkinsa! Open the doors!
JANESSA: Kkinsa! Open the doors!
BOEMAN: Kkinsa! Open the doors!
DELONGPRE: Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
RIZZO: Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
DELONGPRE: I guessed.
RIZZO: I guessed.
BOEMAN: Kkinsa! No!!!
ANOTHER ANGLE: As boxes and cargo shatter under the heaby fire. Smoke rises. It's to see where Jason is. RIZZO stops FIRING.
RIZZO: DON'T WASTE YOUR AMMO! But, they don't let up. Boxes explode, crates collapse until Thorgan's gun clicks empty. Then Delongpre's.
THORGAN: Did we get him? Suddenly, Jason again steps into the Cargo entrance.
DELONGPRE: We're screwed!
RIZZO: 400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?! They are trapped. Jason blocks the only exit. He slowly moves towards Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the We're not leaving Crutch!
RIZZO: Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the We're not leaving Crutch!
BOEMAN: We're not leaving Crutch!
RIZZO: We don't have time to argue! But Jason has locked in on Rizzo. He moves towards her.
JANESSA: Okay, tell you what. You die, we'll run. Rizzo and the others back into a corner. Jason has them. There's nothing can do. Rizzo holds the gun steady, waiting for point blank range.
COMPUTER VOICE: Collision eminent.
BOEMAN: Everyone okay?
THORGAN: I think I broke my arm.
JANESSA: You geeks wanna gimmie a hand? Janessa is buried beneath a pile of rubble. Boeman helps her to her We lost crutch. Rizzo stands and watches as the other sgather around Crutch's body. It's battered and twisted all out of place. Boeman falls next to the Goodbye old friend.
DELONGPRE: ( quiet ) We lost crutch. Rizzo stands and watches as the other sgather around Crutch's body. It's battered and twisted all out of place. Boeman falls next to the Goodbye old friend.
BOEMAN: Goodbye old friend.
RIZZO: Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
BOEMAN: ( snaps ) Could you show a little compassion?! Rizzo stares at Boeman.
RIZZO: Look, I'm sorry. I really am, but aren't you forgetting about . SUDDENLY a pile of rubble EXPLODES. Jason rises, his back to them.
DELONGPRE: Back to the labs! But Jason has other plans. Seemingly unfazed by the past events he rushes after them.
COMPUTER VOICE: Dam-damage port side 59 percent. Decompression 40 percent. Gravity-y rotors INT. CARGO BAY Our kids race toward the door, Jason right behind them Thorgan slams the door panel with his good arm. SPARKS fly. The door won't open.
THORGAN: Oh shit. They turn as Jason looms toward them, then
JANESSA: This is just great.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Jason grabs Rizzo's ankle. Boeman, floating close, punches Jason in the back of the head. Still holding Rizzo's ankle, Jason topples, spinning the two out of The force of the punch sends Boeman in the opposite direction.
THORGAN: This is crazy, we can't do anything like this!
ANOTHER ANGLE: Rizzo KICKS Jason in the top of the head, sending him SLAMMING into the A SEVERED ARM floats past DeLongpre. There's a chain gun still clutched by the hand. Delongpre grabs both and turns the gun on Jason.
ANOTHER ANGLE: As Thorgan manages to grab Kay-Em 14 around the neck.
THORGAN: Grab my hand! Janessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious dELONGPRE'S FOOT.
JANESSA: Boeman, can you reach DeLongpre? We'll push you in.
BOEMAN: reaches for DeLongpre. Inches away. Finally he grabs Delongpre by the locks of his hair, pulls himself closer.
DELONGPRE: Hey! That hurts.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Rizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling. She manages to grab hold of a hanging piece of busted catwalk.
DELONGPRE: ( to Rizzo ) Push off toward us.
JANESSA: Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there. Crutch's body floats into our heroes, his intestines spilling from his open gut, tangling around our heroes.
THORGAN: I'm gonna spew.
JANESSA: That ought'a help the situation.
DELONGPRE: Do it Rizzo! We'll catch you.
RIZZO'S POV: Rizzo stares at the human rope that consists of Thorgan, Janessa, Boeman, and Delongpre.
RIZZO: What if you miss?
DELONGPRE: What if we don't?
ANOTHER ANGLE: AS JASON steadies himself against a wall, focuses in one Rizzo, then pushes off with his feet. HE ROCKETS toward her!
DELONGPRE: He's coming right at you! Rizzo spots Jason and pushes off! But her aim was HURRIED. and bad. She's gonna miss them. Boeman flips in the air!
BOEMAN: ( to Delongpre ) Grab my feet! Delongpre does and Boeman reaches out and snags Rizzo. The momentum spins the human chain into a near wall KAFWAM nearly breaking it apart.
JANESSA: Okay that hurt.
BOEMAN: Thorgan, pull us in. Jason SLAMS into the ceiling, then careens off of the wall As Thorgan pulls the group out of the Cargo bay.
THORGAN: What now? They watch as Jason grabs a hold of the walkway.
JANESSA: Shit. He's gonna send himself right at us. Jason takes aim.
COMPUTER VOICE: System repair activated. Back up power on line.
JANESSA: ( to Rizzo ) Get off of me! They stand slowly, eyeing the rubble.
THORGAN: ( rubbing his arm ) You think it killed . . . ( off Rizzo's stare ) Yeah, I guess not.
JANESSA: Let's just get out of here.
BOEMAN: The ship's in bad shape. Back to the labs. Let's check out status.
BOEMAN: The hull's imploding!
THORGAN: The hull's imploding!
BOEMAN: Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
RIZZO: Yeah. Are you guys okay? Boeman peers through a crack in the collapsed hull.
BOEMAN: There's a red lever on the wall beside you. Pull it! Rizzo turns, spots the red lever. EMERGENCY PRESSURIZATION STABILIZER. It's bolted.
RIZZO: It's locked!
BOEMAN: Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize! Rizzo kicsk the metal leg from a table. BASHES the bolt with it, until it breaks.
BOEMAN: Hurry Rizzo! You have to reverse the pressurization. She grabs the lever.then hesitates. Backs away.
BOEMAN: What are you doing?!!
RIZZO: If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
BOEMAN: Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
RIZZO: It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
DELONGPRE: It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
RIZZO: It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
THORGAN: Hurry! She's lost it!
JANESSA: So what else is new?
RIZZO: Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
JANESSA: Are you crazy?! Pull the lever! Boeman yanks the lever. As the others climb into the lab
COMPUTER VOICE: Depressurization inconclusive.
JANESSA: ( to Rizzo ) You happy? You've killed us all! Thorgan rushes over to the big Nano-tech machine. Places his broken arm on the slab. The machine quickly goes to work. A schematic of his arm appears on the wall. Janessa stares at him.
JANESSA: What's the point? Delongpre shrugs.
DELONGPRE: So that's it then. It seems it is. Janessa stands over Yllo's decapitated body. It's obvious their went beyond just teacher/student. There is a loud METALLIC WHINE from the ship's What's that?
RIZZO: What's that?
BOEMAN: THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
RIZZO: Are there any other shuttles?
JANESSA: Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
RIZZO: Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
THORGAN: You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
JANESSA: A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
THORGAN: Am I in there?
RIZZO: That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
DELONGPRE: That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
RIZZO: All heads turn to Rizzo. She's staring at a schematic of the ship. The left hull of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the system failures. Rizzo points to the right hull.
RIZZO: What's this?
DELONGPRE: It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom. Rizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls.
RIZZO: Can we get through these?
THORGAN: Sure but what good will that do?
BOEMAN: When the left hull goes, so will the What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship? They stare at her.
RIZZO: What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship? They stare at her.
JANESSA: You know, Yllo seemed to think we could catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth The others stare at her as if she were crazy.
RIZZO: Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
JANESSA: I'm just saying.
RIZZO: ( to others ) Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
DELONGPRE: We'd need charges.
BOEMAN: We could convert fission transistors.
THORGAN: We're not supposed to do that.
BOEMAN: What are you gonna do, tell me?
DELONGPRE: The engine room will have molecular welders. We could seal up the hull. A moment of consideration. Could this actually work?
JANESSA: YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
THORGAN: Would you?
DELONGPRE: Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
RIZZO: You got a better plan? Obviously they don't. They got to work. Boeman grabs a number of devices from under a cabinet.
BOEMAN: I'll need system four converters.
THORGAN: They're back here.
DELONGPRE: How many?
BOEMAN: Bring 'em all. Let's move! Thorgan's still hooked up to the Nano-Tech machine.
THORGAN: Hey! I'm not ready.
BOEMAN: Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
JANESSA: You're so bossy.
THORGAN: You're leaving me here alone? Delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him.
DELONGPRE: Don't blow your foot off. They climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear.
THORGAN: Come here, might as well fix that arm.
DELONGPRE: See anything? They move toward the rubble that had buried Jason before. CLOSE on the rubble. There is an obvious hole dug out from the middle.
DELONGPRE: I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
BOEMAN: ( into headset ) Thorgan? You coming?!
THORGAN: ( into headset ) Almost done.
THORGAN: Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
DELONGPRE: Put your finger here. SHe does so. Delongpre connects several wires. Rizzo looks nervous. Delongpre notices.
DELONGPRE: My father wanted me to be a businessman. That's why I'm here.
DELONGPRE: That's why I'm here.
RIZZO: So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up. Delongpre looks at her like she's crazy.
DELONGPRE: My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's for a change.
RIZZO: I thought you meant.
DELONGPRE: You thought I meant.too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl. Silence. Neither speaks.
THORGAN: Sorry, sorry.
THORGAN: Good point.
JANESSA: Thorgan, you little shit, is that you? No answer. She quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of and a monster syring.e She fills this rhino syringe with a massive dosage. Enough to bring down a Rhino.or Jason maybe? She starts moving down the walkway toward the Cargo Bay. Surely she's not that stupid.
RIZZO: When I was four, the ocean quit producing life. Too many pollutants. Nuclear testing, the occasional terrorist bombing.the atmosphere was shit by the time I was eight. We moved underground when I was twelve. Delongpre stares at her. He doesn't want to speak and screw up this rare moment of sharing.
ANOTHER POV: We see Janessa come into view.
DELONGPRE: Were you close to your father? Thorgan interrupts over the headset.
DELONGPRE: ( into mike ) It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
DELONGPRE: Sorry, you were saying?
WATCHER'S POV: JANESSA approaches the pile of debris where Jason was buried.
DELONGPRE: And what happend to .? Rizzo begins to tear up.
RIZZO: I couldn't save them.
DELONGPRE: Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you? She stares at him.
DELONGPRE: It's true. You caused enough stink that we were at least a little cautious. Of course this is the first field trip I went on that had a body count. She gives him a half smile.
DELONGPRE: I'm not much, but I promise, I won't let this guy get you. Another half smile. It's a sweet gesture, but what can this guy really INT. CARGO BAY JASON'S POV He watches Janessa from a distance. Moving slowly and silently toward She stands and turns as SERGEANT BRODSKI grabs her! She SCREAMS. He's covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut.
JASON'S POV: He watches Janessa from a distance. Moving slowly and silently toward She stands and turns as SERGEANT BRODSKI grabs her! She SCREAMS. He's covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut.
BRODSKI: Where is everybody? What happened?
JANESSA: Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
BRODSKI: Give me a break! What happened?
JANESSA: Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
BRODSKI: Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
JANESSA: Yllo's dead. We.we thought you were too.
BRODSKI: Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
BRODSKI: Yup, that ought'a do it. Jason turns on Janessa. She stands frozen in fear. Jason raises his machete and
JANESSA: Lights a flare, blinding Jason for the moment. Then she sinks the Rhino into his chest! Jason stumbles.falls hard on his ass and sits there at her.
JANESSA: Well go on! Pass out! Jason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside.
JANESSA: Jason starts to climb to his feet. Janessa turns to run.
BRODSKI: ( weak ) He-help me. He holds his hand out to her. Then
DELONGPRE: We're blowing three. Hang on. He throws a switch!
BOEMAN: Janessa, we're on our way to you!
BOEMAN: Where is.?
DELONGPRE: You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished! With that Janessa tears into the walkway. She's out of breath. She can barely speak.
BOEMAN: Where have you been?!!
JANESSA: He's coming!!!
DELONGPRE: He's coming!!!
THEIR POV: JASON moves through the debris. He's coming straight for them.
BOEMAN: They race down the length of the walkway. Jason right behind them.
RIZZO: We can't lead him into the other hull!
BOEMAN: We don't have a choice! Boeman slams the door panel. The door slowly rises. Jason approaches, stops, stares at his future victims. If he could smile with anticipation.he would. He raises his Machete Then stops. Lowers it.
THORGAN: Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
DELONGPRE: Holy shit! JASON jumps up and rushes at Kay-Em who catches him and tosses him down the walkway BRAAAATTT! Kay-Em opens up again. Kay-Em's weaponry shoves Jason out into the cargo bay witha blur of bullets.
ANOTHER ANGLE: What are we waiting for?!! Come on!! Our heroes rush down the walkway toward the cargo bay. Boeman and Delongpre go to work setting the charges.
BOEMAN: What are we waiting for?!! Come on!! Our heroes rush down the walkway toward the cargo bay. Boeman and Delongpre go to work setting the charges.
BOEMAN: ( to Janessa ) Where the hell were you?!!
JANESSA: He came for me, I had to run!
THORGAN: ( into mike ) Kay-Em, you okay?
BOEMAN: Toss me a chip. Delongpre pulls a trinket from his pack and pitches it to Boeman.
BOEMAN: Thorgan, you're brilliant. Have I told you that lately? Thorgan is standing at the end of the walkway staring into the cargo He looks sad.
THORGAN: ( quietly ) See you around.
BRATTTT!!!: Kay-Em blows Jason into
BOEMAN: I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
DELONGPRE: Then stop talking and work faster!
WHAM!: Kay-Em 14 back hands Jason across the room. He crashes into the glass speciments. Goo and formaldehyde covering him.
BOEMAN: Okay, Janessa, give me your last charge. Janessa looks around, then
JANESSA: I.I don't know what I did.
DELONGPRE: You lost the charge?
JANESSA: He was chasing me!
RIZZO: Can we blow it with just two?
BOEMAN: If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
DELONGPRE: Then what do we do?!
BOEMAN: I don't know!
DELONGPRE: Well, it was a good plan. They look at one another hopless. Then
BRODSKI: Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
BOEMAN: Sergeant? We thought you were.
BRODSKI: Yeah, yeah. Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
JANESSA: I don't know.sorry?
RIZZO: Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
BRODSKI: Explosive. We're blowing the walkway. The sergeant tosses his pack to the ground.
BOEMAN: Explosive. We're blowing the walkway. The sergeant tosses his pack to the ground.
BRODSKI: How much you need?
BRAAAATTTT!!!!: Jason is blown across the room!
BRODSKI: Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
BOEMAN: Rizzo did. CHA-CHUNG.CHA-CHUNG. Kay-Em steps into the walkway. She's covered in What are you doing back?!!
THORGAN: What are you doing back?!!
BOEMAN: What are you doing back?!!
RIZZO: You killed him?
THORGAN: You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
RIZZO: His mother?
BOEMAN: I don't know. Nothing. Suddenly the ship's hull SCREAMS. The ship BUCKS. Everyone tumbles.
RIZZO: I don't know. Nothing. Suddenly the ship's hull SCREAMS. The ship BUCKS. Everyone tumbles.
BOEMAN: Hurry up people! We're running out of time.
THORGAN: As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
BOEMAN: Two more charges to go.
THORGAN: Let's move out!
BOEMAN: Let's move out!
BRODSKI: Kid, you ever thought about the marine corp? Delongpre calls fromthe far end of the walkway, welder in his hand.
DELONGPRE: I need another minute. Come on!
BRODSKI: Well fuck me.
THORGAN: Kay-Em? Re-engage killer instinct.
BRAAAATTTTT!: Kay-em firs. But, this time it doesn't seem to faze Jason. SPARKS fly as bullets vounce off of his metal limbs. Jason swings his new improved machete. It CLANGS off of Kay-Em's armor, removing a hunk of metal. Jason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway. Glass CRACKS. One of the wires, connecting two charges severs.
BOEMAN: Kay-em does a back flip, kicking Jason in the chest. He's shoved Boeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues. IT'S MASSIVE! Intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic SPARKS FLY. GUNFIRE SOUNDS. Then Kay-Em does a round house kick, but Jason uses his machete as a shield. Kay-Em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee. She stumbles.falls to the ground.
THORGAN: Boeman splices the wires together.
BOEMAN: Then turns to see Jason approaching.
BOEMAN: But Jason's too close. He grabs Boeman.
RUN!!: But Jason's too close. He grabs Boeman.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Jason rears back and shoves his fist though Kay-Em's chestplate! his fist from Kay-Em's chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat.
THORGAN: Kay-Em! Get away! Thorgan moves toward his robotic love but Boeman grabs him and pulls him the hall.
JASON: Turns his glare on our heroes racing toward Delongpre at the other end.
DELONGPRE: Delongpre lifts his welder's mask to call to the others when he sees
DELONGPRE: Delongpre lifts his welder's mask to call to the others when he sees
DELONGPRE: Shit, hurry!
OUR HEROES: Run toward the door. But, Thorgan stops.
BOEMAN: Thorgan turns, runs back toward Jason.
BOEMAN: What are you doing?!! Thorgan is running to retrieve Kay-Em 14's head. It lies between he and He'll never make it! Thorgan hits the floor, slides and scoops up the I think I'm going to throw up.
RIZZO: ( to Thorgan ) Jason stumbles backwards then whirls on Rizzo.
RIZZO: Oh, yeah, you remember me. He sure does. She turnsa dn runs.
ANOTHER ANGLE: As the others race into the engien room they turn to watch.
BOEMAN: Faster! Don't we have another gun? Rizzo catches up to Thorgan but they have a long way to go and Jason is gaining.
DELONGPRE: Faster! Don't we have another gun? Rizzo catches up to Thorgan but they have a long way to go and Jason is gaining.
JANESSA: They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
DELONGPRE: They'll make it.
JANESSA: Close the fucking door!
DELONGPRE: JANESSA leaps forward and hits the switch. The door begins sliding slowly shut.
NO!: JANESSA leaps forward and hits the switch. The door begins sliding slowly shut.
DELONGPRE: Boeman hits the button again.
DELONGPRE: ( glares at Janessa ) Forget it. I had to rewire it. Once it's started it won't stop.
ANOTHER ANGLE: TWENTY PACES BEHIND INT. ENGINE ROOM Rizzo dives, slides under the closing door. Thorgan follows her lead, but his slide doesn't have the same force. He stops with the door coming down on his lower back. Luckily, Delongpre snatches his arms and yanks him through. The door closes!
JASON: TWENTY PACES BEHIND INT. ENGINE ROOM Rizzo dives, slides under the closing door. Thorgan follows her lead, but his slide doesn't have the same force. He stops with the door coming down on his lower back. Luckily, Delongpre snatches his arms and yanks him through. The door closes!
DELONGPRE: Get ready to blow it. Rizzo dives, slides under the closing door. Thorgan follows her lead, but his slide doesn't have the same force. He stops with the door coming down on his lower back. Luckily, Delongpre snatches his arms and yanks him through. The door closes!
DELONGPRE: Boeman turns the switch.
BRODSKI: Boeman climbs to a console.
BOEMAN: We made it?
RIZZO: We made it?
DELONGPRE: I think.I think maybe we did.
CHEERS: Thorgan looks into Kay-Em 14's severed head.
THORGAN: Kay-Em we made it!
BOEMAN: I've changed the course for Earth II. And I sent a distress signal.
BOEMAN: ( into mike ) Our ship has been damaged, most of the crew dead. We need evac.
VOICE: Copy that Grendel. Rescue enroute. You should hit EARTH II orbit in fifteen minutes. Rescue ETA twenty minutes.
CHEERS!: We're going home people. More CHEERS. Rizzo turns to find Delonpre staring at her.
BOEMAN: We're going home people. More CHEERS. Rizzo turns to find Delonpre staring at her.
DELONGPRE: ( big smile ) See? We're not so bad.
RIZZO: Not so bad. There's that moment when we think the two might kiss. She takes a step toward him. Yes, they are going to kiss
BOOM!: WARNING LIGHTS. WARNING ALARMS. The sound of SUCKING WIND. AS JASON, still very alive shoves his fist through the imprinted door with his metal hand! As he rips a bigger hole to gain entrance our heroes are fighting to on to anything. The Hole is sucking everything not tied down out into space. Boeman is the first to reach the reactor room door.
BOEMAN: This way! He pulls Sergeant Brodski through the door as
JASON: Fights his way through the opening in the hull. The engines BUCK and begin to SMOKE.
BOEMAN: The pressures cause the engines to overheat! Delongpre helps Rizzo and Thorgan to safety. Janessa crawls across the floor digging her fingers into the steel mesh.
SERGEANT BRODKSI: Lying in the door's threshold reaches out and snags her hand.
JANESSA: Pull me in!
BRODSKI: I'm pulling, damnit! But Jason grabs Janessa's ankle and jerks. She's pulled from the She flops around in the sucking wind as Jason watches. He lets go. She flies toward the hole, slams into it. Everything goes quiet for a moment. As he body has sealed the hole then
SHHHHHHHHOOOOOK!: She's sucked into space in a most grotesque manner.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Well, that's a shame.
BRODSKI: Well, that's a shame.
BRODSKI: We need weapons.
RIZZO: Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
DELONGPRE: It bought us some time.
BOEMAN: And now we're all out of it. Everyone stares at Boeman. He's standing at another console.
BOEMAN: The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it reaches the core, we're done.
RIZZO: Again?! Jesus!
THORGAN: Again?! Jesus!
DELONGPRE: Again?! Jesus!
RIZZO: Why am I not surprised? Thorgan still clutches Kay-Em 14's severed head.
DELONGPRE: Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
BRODSKI: Can't shut em' down from here.
BOEMAN: Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
DELONGPRE: You ain't catching my ass in there again. Brodski, still bleeding, pale, struggling to stand
BRODSKI: I'll go. The kids give him the "are you crazy?" stare.
BOEMAN: You're too weak. I'll go. KA-FWAM! Everyone jumps but this time it's only Rizzo. She broke a metal stand and has yanked one of the legs free.
RIZZO: You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
DELONGPRE: ( mumbling ) Wait around on your asses all day. ( turns to Thorgan ) I'll need a distraction.
RIZZO: ( mumbling ) Wait around on your asses all day. ( turns to Thorgan ) I'll need a distraction.
THORGAN: What kind of a distraction?
THEN: Jason turns to find Rizzo standing in the doorway behind him.
RIZZO: Jason turns to find Rizzo standing in the doorway behind him.
HEY!: Jason turns to find Rizzo standing in the doorway behind him.
RIZZO: You want some of me? Jason whirls around and lurches toward her clinging to machinery as he INT. ENGINE ROOM CORRIDOR Rizzo backs slowly as Jason closes in. As he reaches the corridor, she turns and runs.
RIZZO: Come on, keep up. Jason barrels toward her.
RIZZO: Come on, keep up. Jason barrels toward her.
RIZZO: You want some of me or not? She stops at a door, but doesn't attmept ot open it. Jason comes closer..and closeer.but Rizzo doesn't move Jason moves in for the kill, raises his machete, and
RIZZO: Take your best shot
SLASH!: RIZZO'S CHEST IS SPLIT OPEN! SLASH! Her arm falls to the ground!
RIZZO: ( laughs ) I'm melting! I'm melting! SLASH! Her arm falls to the ground!
RIZZO: See now that was stupid. Persistent, yes, but stupid. Jason shoves his fist, through her chest and into the wall.
RIZZO: Not this time, asshole. This time I'm gonna watch you burn in hell.
RIZZO: Make it fast. He's coming. Delongpre is punching numbers into the keypad. Both are wearing Almost got it.
DELONGPRE: Almost got it.
