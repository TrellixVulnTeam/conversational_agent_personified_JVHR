PHIL: Yes. Alone, if possible. And would you have a gurney standing by in case I need to move him?
NURSE: And you are.. his physician? Or perhaps a close relative?
PHIL: Actually, I'm his road manager.
NURSE: So you're not his physician or a close relative?
PHIL: Mister Parsons is awaiting a post mortem. He will then be delivered to his family. I suggest you speak to them if you wish to pick through his personal effects. Sir.

PHIL: Now listen here.
NURSE: No, you listen here. Mister Parsons is dead and no longer appears to need a road manager. Which makes two of us.
PHIL: He walks over to the next gurney and lifts the sheet. He stares down at the body, visibly moved.

EXPERT: He sang country music in a way that it had never been sung before. It was 'country rock', if you like. And it was kinda catchy. At least, the young people seemed to lap it up. It's fair to say that when Gram Parsons died, he died a star.
HIPPIE: It's like. I can't. It was real, kinda. I. Oh, man.
REPORTER: And another light burns out in the desert. Gram Parsons - the standard bearer of the new country music movement - is dead, following an overdose of drugs. While many of America's young people are today in mourning, their parents will view this as another example of how today's drug culture can so easily claim a life. We'll leave you tonight with the young man's own words. Gram Parsons wrote a song called 'In My Hour of Darkness', which contains these words: 'In my hour of darkness.'
GRAM'S VOICE: In my hour of darkness, in my time of need, Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord grant me speed. Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord grant me speed.
PHIL: He sits up and stretches. She leans over to kiss him, then stands and starts to tidy. He watches her. She picks up some clothing from near his chair and moves away. He drops another piece of clothing on the same spot. She says nothing and picks it up. He takes a sock off and drops it. It has stopped being a game and started being a statement. She picks the sock up and drops it in his lap. He pushes it back onto the floor. She opens her arms and everything falls to the floor. She walks out of the room and into the kitchen. He follows.

SUSIE: Phil, you give me laughs and a great time. But I'm not sure if that's enough.
PHIL: You mean there's more than that?
SUSIE: Yes, there's more than that! There's dependable, responsible, There's dull, boring, normal. You should hook up with someone who works in a bank. I know a guy, actually.

BARBARA: Do you know what this is?
PHIL: Did he write that with joined up writing or was it before he knew
BARBARA: Still the jester Kaufman, and still very unfunny.
PHIL: That's not a will Barbara, and you know it.
BARBARA: It's better than a will, actually. It's a signed promise from Gram to leave me all his assets and belongings. And anyway, it's really none of your business what this is. I've come for the guitar.
PHIL: Yes. Gram's guitar. He always kept it here.
BARBARA: Yes. Gram's guitar. He always kept it here.

PHIL: I'm going.
SUSIE: I'm going.

PHIL: It's supposed to be black.
LARRY: But they're all black.
PHIL: That might be my point.
LARRY: So how is a yellow hearse covered with flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse?
PHIL: I paid you two hundred dollars for a black hearse.
LARRY: ( patiently ) No, you paid me a hundred and eighty dollars for a hearse, and a hearse is what you've got. If you take a long, hard look at Bernice, you'll see that she's one of a kind. She's big, she's fast, she's comfortable, and she's beautiful. But she's not Okay. Where are the keys?

CLERK: Barney - bring up Parsons.
BANK MANAGER: I simply can't give you any money based on this piece of paper.
BARBARA: It's not a piece of paper. It's a promise from Gram to leave me all his money.
BANK MANAGER: Well, I'm sorry, but it's highly likely that the estate will go to probate and be divided up accordingly, subject to a valid will existing.
BARBARA: You don't seem to understand. These are his wishes.
BANK MANAGER: No. I do. understand, Miss Mansfield. Really I do.
BARBARA: Please tell me how I'm supposed to get my money.
BANK MANAGER: Well I imagine that you first need to prove that mister Parsons is actually dead.
BARBARA: Are you saying that I'm lying?

LARRY: Well. the first part.
COP: The first part.
LARRY: Going on?
PHIL: Well, I don't care if it is first thing in the morning - but I sure need a coffee. I tell you, I've never seen so many darned bits of paper to sign! It's paperwork which is slowing this great country down. We're drowning in

COP: And you're gonna meet him off his flight with her coffin?
PHIL: Yeah. We're doing it this way for the avoidance of doubt.
LARRY: Ignition's a bit temperamental.
COP: More fiddling. No ignition.
LARRY: Have to use a screwdriver.
COP: I see that.
PHIL: Thanks for everything, officer. We'd best be off.

OFFICIAL: Don't forget now.
PHIL: So then Bobby transfers 'em into hardboard boxes just prior to the cremation and I drive the caskets over to a guy I know in Palm Springs who resells them.
LARRY: As new?

BARBARA: Hello Kaufman. I know what you're up to, you thieving bastard. I know where you're going, and I know about your sick, revolting plans, and I'm coming after you. And when I catch you.
PHIL: Hello Barbara. How nice to hear from you again. And so soon.
BARBARA: She walks to the door, brushing past Susie. Then she Barbara shows Susie the door.
SUSIE: You don't know shit about him.
BARBARA: Well why don't we find out?
PHIL: So what's that about?
LARRY: Phil shakes his head.
PHIL: You've hardly left the car since we met. How can you have I'm susceptible.
LARRY: I'm susceptible.
PHIL: You're a winner, that's what you are. A winner.
LARRY: This isn't the way to Palm
PHIL: It is if you're a coffin
START TIME: We stay on the old woman and her melon stall as the light rapidly changes, cars and pedestrians whizz by, and an hour passes in moments.
STANLEY: Good afternoon.
OLD WOMAN: He points at a melon.
STANLEY: I'll take that one, please.
OLD WOMAN: Fifty cents.
STANLEY: I was wondering. Have you seen a hearse pass this way in the last couple of hours?
OLD WOMAN: What's it look like?
STANLEY: Well. It. It's a big car. A big yellow car. Two guys inside.
OLD WOMAN: Was one of 'em sick in them Well. I don't know. Maybe.
STANLEY: Well. I don't know. Maybe.
OLD WOMAN: Yup. I seen it.
LARRY: See, the Yin is the negative - the darkside. And the Yang represents positive - good. If you like, the first is earth and the second heaven.
LARRY: The Yin Yang symbol is really evocative about the whole concept. As you travel around the circle, white or black will increase until the opposite color is almost gone. But never totally gone, right? And this cycle then repeats for the opposite color.
LARRY: What seems like Yin is often supported by Yang, and vice versa. Let me give you an example: To truly know good, you must first know evil, and without good as a comparison, nothing can be evil. So by allowing Yin to flourish, you welcome Yan. By letting go of Yin, you are waiting for its return. Another example is.
PHIL: It would be really nice if we could get through a couple of hours without crashing the car.
LARRY: I was distracted.
PHIL: Of course you were.
LARRY: What now?
PHIL: Pretend we're having a
LARRY: Okay. What about?
PHIL: I don't know what about! Ever since I met you, you've talked. Yabba, yabba, yabba, every waking minute. Religion, your supersonic, supercharged car, the darkside. Now you need to talk, and you can't think of anything to say.
LARRY: Well. it's more a philosophy than a religion.
PHIL: Oh, well done. Good work.
MOTORCYCLE COP: Afternoon, officer. How's it going today?
PHIL: Afternoon, officer. How's it going today?
MOTORCYCLE COP: Oh, it's going fine, thank you. How are things with you?
PHIL: Fine, fine. We just. stopped to take a look at.
MOTORCYCLE COP: Well, it is mighty nice around these parts. If you like desert.
LARRY: Ooooh, I'm well. Really well, actually. Thank you.
MOTORCYCLE COP: The reason I ask, is that you appear to have driven into one of our road signs.
LARRY: MOTORCYCLE COP
MOTORCYCLE COP: I'm surprised that you hadn't noticed earlier, as it does appear to be impeding your forward progress.
PHIL: That's a great line.
MOTORCYCLE COP: Thank you.
PHIL: MOTORCYCLE COP
MOTORCYCLE COP: I'm looking for some fellows who stole a body back there at the
LARRY: A body? Stole a body?
MOTORCYCLE COP: A body. Rather like the one in the back of your car.
LARRY: That's an empty coffin, officer.
MOTORCYCLE COP: I know it sounds strange. But these guys - there are two of them - they stole a body, loaded it into the back of an old yellow hearse painted with flowers, and they're supposed to be driving out this way.
LARRY: Hearse. Flowers.
PHIL: I think he's onto us, Larry. He's just having a little fun at our expense.
MOTORCYCLE COP: In the car, please.
PHIL: God damn!
LARRY: He said a body. He said we stole a body.
PHIL: He meant a coffin.
LARRY: He didn't say 'coffin'. He said 'body'. Tell me we haven't stolen a real person.
PHIL: Look, the place that I get the coffins from probably haven't filed a report yet. It'll all be sorted out within the hour. Trust me.
LARRY: Oh, I'm just overflowing with trust for you, man. I feel this overwhelming feeling of. trust every time I look at you.
PHIL: They sit glowering out of different windows at different bits of desert. The motorcycle cop can be heard talking into his radio.
LARRY: What are we going to do?
PHIL: ( bitterly ) We're going to be arrested, that's what we're going to do. Then we'll go to court and then we'll go to jail and we'll do that for a while.
LARRY: ( bitterly ) We're going to be arrested, that's what we're going to do. Then we'll go to court and then we'll go to jail and we'll do that for a while.
PHIL: ( bitterly ) We're going to be arrested, that's what we're going to do. Then we'll go to court and then we'll go to jail and we'll do that for a while.
LARRY: What about if I could slip out of these cuffs?
PHIL: Yeah, that would be great. Then we could suspend you from a bridge in a straitjacket and set the rope on fire.
LARRY: No, really. I really can slip these cuffs.
PHIL: Okay. Show me.
LARRY: Do you think we should go?
PHIL: Yes, I think we should go.
LARRY: Oh shit.
PHIL: Nicely done.
PHIL: What the hell are you doing?
LARRY: The steering lock is on.
PHIL: Well. turn it off!
LARRY: I can't - he's got the keys.
PHIL: So, we've escaped but we can only drive in a circle?
LARRY: EXT. DESERT. DAY They do another circuit. The exhausted cop stops, breathing heavily, and then watches in astonishment as the hearse turns and heads back towards him.
PHIL: Can we please go?
LARRY: EXT. DESERT. DAY The hearse roars away and the cop watches it go.
SUSIE: If you hate Phil so much, why are you chasing him across He's got Gram and I need him.
BARBARA: He's got Gram and I need him.
SUSIE: Well, that's really touching. But. you've got to come to terms with the fact that he's
BARBARA: I know he's dead, Honey. But he hasn't been officially identified, and there's no certificate of death.
SUSIE: I don't understand.
BARBARA: Let's just say I'm overly sentimental, okay?
SUSIE: This is all about money, isn't Isn't everything?
BARBARA: Isn't everything?
SUSIE: Why do you think you deserve I was a great support to Gram before Kaufman came along and spoiled the party.
BARBARA: I was a great support to Gram before Kaufman came along and spoiled the party.
SUSIE: Phil's not responsible for your problems with Gram.
BARBARA: What do you know?
SUSIE: I know that he can be a pain in the ass, but when it came to Gram, Phil only ever did the right thing.
BARBARA: In his whole life, Phil Kaufman didn't do anything because it was the right thing to do. You can bet the ranch that wherever he is, he's having some fun.
SUSIE: Maybe that's what I like about Sure it is, honey. That's why your bags were packed.
BARBARA: Sure it is, honey. That's why your bags were packed.
SUSIE: Have you any idea what it's like to really love someone?
BARBARA: You might exclusively love Phil Kaufman - but unfortunately, so does he. You're just handy to have around.
SUSIE: I don't have to listen to this.
BARBARA: The truth can hurt, can't it?
LARRY: Well, that's it! They're going to lock me up and throw away the Why would they do that?
PHIL: Why would they do that?
LARRY: You saw what happened. I drove over that cop's bike. That's destruction of police property, or something.
PHIL: You worry too much.
LARRY: Not 'til I met you.
PHIL: Jesus - what the hell is that?
LARRY: It's a dinosaur.
PHIL: Very perceptive. What's it
LARRY: ( reads ) 'The Polyonax Place'. ( aside: to Phil ) A Polyonax is probably some kind of dinosaur.
PHIL: Pull over - let's. eat.
LARRY: Let's not. The cops'll be after us and we should just get on to Palm Springs and do the thing, and then I can get home and you can. do whatever it is you do. Let's do that.
PHIL: We need to stop. I'm starting to get hungry. I'm not nice hungry.
LARRY: You surprise me. I vote we keep What gave you the impression this was a democracy?
PHIL: What gave you the impression this was a democracy?
PHIL: You frighten him.
LARRY: I do not.
PHIL: Everyone else, he announces the food when he brings it. Diplodocus this and Allosaurus that. Us he just slaps it down and runs for cover.
LARRY: Look, I'm a vegetarian. I have a problem with dead flesh. Okay?
PHIL: I understand. Really I do. That stuff'll mess you right up every
LARRY: I thought you were hungry.
PHIL: Gotta make a call.
BARMAN: Out back.
STANLEY: Good afternoon.
BARMAN: Do you have a telephone I might In a minute, I do.
STANLEY: Do you have a telephone I might In a minute, I do.
BARMAN: In a minute, I do.
STANLEY: In a minute?
BARMAN: Yeah. Phone's for customers.
STANLEY: I'd better order, then.
BARMAN: Stanley picks up a menu.
LARRY: Speak to her?
PHIL: Your girlfriend? Your wife?
LARRY: Your girlfriend? Your wife?
PHIL: None of your damn business.
LARRY: So you didn't?
PHIL: CON TINUE D: Phil pours the rest of his beer down his throat, before signaling the barman to serve him another.
LARRY: Maybe she's out. Shopping, or
PHIL: Yeah, that'll be it. Shopping.
STANLEY: ( to barman )
BARMAN: He pours the spirit in.
STANLEY: Yeaaaaah. Yeah, a real bad day.
BARMAN: What happened?
STANLEY: My boy died out here the other day, and some punks have stolen his body.
BARMAN: That's worth a shot on the house.
STANLEY: CON TINUE D: ( 2 ) Stanley takes a drink. Phil slips some money on the bar and stands up.
PHIL: ( to Larry ) We gotta go.
LARRY: Haven't finished my drink.
BARMAN: ( to Stanley ) Why would someone steal a body?
PHIL: All gone. C'mon.
STANLEY: Well, maybe they were souvenir hunters or something. My boy's kinda famous.
BARMAN: Who is he?
STANLEY: Gram Parsons.
BARMAN: Gram Parsons?
LARRY: Gram Parsons?
LARRY: Gram Parsons? Is Gram Parsons Better get going.
PHIL: Better get going.
LARRY: He said someone took Gram Parson's body. Two people.
PHIL: Yeah, he was a real blabbermouth. In fact, I thought he was never gonna stop talking. Anyway, although that's real interesting, we've gotta keep to the schedule.
LARRY: Schedule? What schedule? There is no schedule.
PHIL: Well, I think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible, don't you? Get our package to Palm Springs. Remember?
LARRY: Package? We've stolen that man's Stolen. his son? That's outrageous! I'm appalled that you could even think we'd do such a thing.
PHIL: Stolen. his son? That's outrageous! I'm appalled that you could even think we'd do such a thing.
LARRY: I don't know what you take me for. I want to see in that box.
PHIL: We've really got to go.
LARRY: It's heavy.
PHIL: Okay, then. Well, if you're satisfied, let's go.
LARRY: I said it's heavy.
PHIL: Heavy, yes. Well, it is made of wood. Wood is heavy. Actually.
LARRY: Yeah, I remember. Finest poplar.
PHIL: Gosh, they must have given us a full one. We'll have to sort that all out when we get to Palm Springs and.
LARRY: Oh my God. You stole Gram
PHIL: Well, technically, we stole Gram I stole a coffin, I didn't know there was a body in it.
LARRY: I stole a coffin, I didn't know there was a body in it.
PHIL: I'd save that line for court.
LARRY: I don't know! What am I doing? I mean. What-am-I-doing? Why am I here? Why am I with you?
PHIL: Calm down.
LARRY: I thought it was bad enough when I ran over the cop's bike, but now I'm a fucking body snatcher.
PHIL: Well, when you've quite finished, we should go.
LARRY: Go? You go. I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going inside and I'm going to give that man his son back. I'm going to do the right thing, I'm going to follow my conscience, I'm going
PHIL: Phil picks him up, slings him into the passenger seat, and slides behind the wheel. The hearse moves off.
STANLEY: Son of a bitch!
SUSIE: You're not a very nice person, are you?
BARBARA: Nice? No, I suppose not. Does it matter?
SUSIE: It might get you further.
BARBARA: I do okay. Listen, I was an orphan at fourteen and a waitress at fifteen. I do what I do because it puts food on my table, and because if I don't look after myself, no-one else will.
SUSIE: So what do you want from us?
BARBARA: I don't want anything from you. It would be a bonus to see Kaufman crash and burn, but I don't need to be there when it Why do you hate Phil so much?
SUSIE: Why do you hate Phil so much?
BARBARA: Gram was the first good guy I ever hooked up with. He wasn't perfect, but it worked between us. We just seemed to fit together. But Gram was already wild, and I made him wilder. Kaufman watched over him like a hawk, and when he felt things were getting out of control, he turned Gram against me. I lost the only decent thing in my life.
SUSIE: Surely Phil was just looking after Gram?
BARBARA: Gram was an adult. He didn't need a nursemaid.
SUSIE: Except that now he's dead.
BARBARA: Yeah. Without my help and while Kaufman was babysitting.
SUSIE: I don't like you much, Barbara.
BARBARA: That's fine. I just want what's mine and then I'm gone. Gone real fast.
PHIL: Welcome back, hippie.
LARRY: So why d'ya do it?
PHIL: Do what?
LARRY: Have a guess.
PHIL: Well, I gave my word. This is what Gram wanted.
LARRY: What, cruise around the desert until he starts to smell? Were you - both bombed?
PHIL: Do you have friends?
LARRY: Of course I have friends.
PHIL: Well, what would you do for them?
LARRY: Anything, within reason.
PHIL: That's what I hate about people like you. Everything's 'within reason'. There are always boundaries, provisos. You only operate with a safety net.
LARRY: Tell me something - if it was the other way round, would Gram be sitting here, driving your bones out into the desert?
PHIL: You've missed the point. See, it doesn't matter what he would do, or what you and your tie-dyed friends think is the correct way to behave. To me, it only matters what I do. Where you have boundaries and limits and thresholds - I only have right and wrong. If I make a promise, I keep it - that's right. If I break that promise - that's
LARRY: He slides Phil across the seat and slips behind the wheel. He shouts at the unconscious Phil.
LARRY: He flicks the headlight switch, but to no avail. Then, in the distance, he sees a car approaching. Stanley can be glimpsed in the driving seat as the car flashes past.
STANLEY: They stare at each other.
LARRY: They stare at each other.
STANLEY: They stare at each other.
LARRY: Um. I'm one of the guys that took your son.
STANLEY: You'd better come in.
BARBARA: Where's the catch on this piece of shit?
SUSIE: Phil? Phil!
SUSIE: What happened to your head?
PHIL: A hippie hit it. I thought you'd Hold that thought.
SUSIE: Hold that thought.
PHIL: What the hell does that mean?
SUSIE: I need to know what it is you're
BARBARA: I told you what he's doing! He's going to set fire to my Gram in some freaky ceremony with witches and black magic and. dolls.
PHIL: Dolls to stick pins in.
SUSIE: Dolls to stick pins in.
PHIL: What the hell are you talking I want my man back!
BARBARA: ( shouts ) I want my man back!
PHIL: Enough of this shit.
PHIL: Whatever happened to peace, love and understanding, hippie?
STANLEY: You're Kaufman?
PHIL: Stanley folds his arms. Susie and Barbara follow Phil into the room.
STANLEY: And you are?
SUSIE: I'm with him.
BARBARA: Hello Stanley. Remember me? The psychotic girlfriend?
STANLEY: Hello Barbara. Nothing wrong with your memory.
LARRY: Well, I didn't even know he was in the box.
PHIL: I'm going to cremate him, here in the desert where he felt most at home. That's what he wanted.
BARBARA: The hell you are, Kaufman.
STANLEY: You know I can't let you do that?
PHIL: I know you have to. I don't have to do anything, Mister Kaufman. This is MY loss! This was MY son! How dare you try to take my grief away from It's too late to claim him now.
STANLEY: I don't have to do anything, Mister Kaufman. This is MY loss! This was MY son! How dare you try to take my grief away from It's too late to claim him now.
PHIL: It's too late to claim him now.
STANLEY: What the hell does that mean?
PHIL: It means that you were never there when it mattered to Gram. It means that you stopped being a father the moment he stopped doing your bidding. It means that you learned to care too late. That's what it means.
STANLEY: I don't have to justify my relationship with Gram to you.
PHIL: Not to me, no.
STANLEY: It's true that when Gram left college, we drifted apart.
PHIL: No - he gave it his all, but in a way you could never understand. And all he ever wanted from you was approval. He wanted you to be proud of what he had achieved.
STANLEY: I kept everything. Every record, every article, every photo.
PHIL: It's no good telling me. You should have told him.
STANLEY: I loved him.
PHIL: Too late.
STANLEY: I understand that you were his right-hand man, as well as his I was both, yes.
PHIL: I was both, yes.
STANLEY: And that you weren't there when he died? When he needed you
PHIL: Yes. That's right.
STANLEY: So the guilt isn't all mine, I guess not.
PHIL: I guess not.
STANLEY: You boys took away my son. I lost him once in life, and now you're trying to take him from me
BARBARA: Can we just cut through this?
STANLEY: Son, you had your chance to look after Gram, and now he's dead.
BARBARA: ( O.S ) I only failed because I couldn't save him from himself. You failed him all his life. You never believed. I never doubted.
PHIL: I only failed because I couldn't save him from himself. You failed him all his life. You never believed. I never doubted.
STANLEY: Okay. You tell me why I should let you take my boy.
PHIL: I was his road manager and his friend. We loved it out here in the desert, and we made a pact that whoever died first, the other would come down here and set them free. Gram gave his word and I gave mine.
STANLEY: You're a couple of druggies. Why should I believe you?
PHIL: I don't take drugs.
STANLEY: What about you? Are you a
LARRY: Yes. Yes I am.
PHIL: ( to Larry ) Nice work. Let's go.
LARRY: I can't do this. This isn't
SUSIE: Just do whatever feels right to God damn!
PHIL: God damn!
PHIL: Did you call them?
STANLEY: Are you going to call them?
PHIL: Are you going to call them?
STANLEY: Well, you haven't given me a reason not to.
PHIL: There isn't a reason. If someone tried to steal my son's body, I'd stop them. For sure.
STANLEY: So you are prepared to go to I'm expecting to.
PHIL: I'm expecting to.
BARBARA: ( O.S ) Don't you worry - it's gonna Mister Parsons?
LARRY: Mister Parsons?
STANLEY: What is it, son?
LARRY: I've been a junkie for over four years. I started taking heroin on June 5th 1969 at a concert in Indiana. I.
STANLEY: You don't need.
LARRY: I've taken heroin, speed, uppers, downers, blues, morphine, methadone, mushrooms, quaaludes, acid, valium, barbiturates, straight LSD, marijuana, marijuana laced with opium, nembutal, mescalin of course, and medical methaqualone, which made me shake uncontrollably for six weeks and vomit every hour.
STANLEY: ( dryly ) That's very impressive, son.
LARRY: Not my point.
PHIL: Better make the point.
LARRY: I started working my way through that list on June 5th 1969, and since then there hasn't been a day when I didn't at least smoke one joint.
PHIL: Are we sure that this is helping?
LARRY: And now I've stopped. I stopped because it seems that I had something more important to do.
STANLEY: I'm going to go say goodbye to my
PHIL: What's that for?
SUSIE: That's for failing to reinforce my expectations.
PHIL: Well. I'll have to do that more Did you really take all those Of course not.
LARRY: Of course not.
PHIL: C'mon, time to go.
PHIL: Just checking.
LARRY: Yeah, he took the body and stuffed it in the trunk of his car before escaping into the
PHIL: Are you coming?
SUSIE: I reckon I am.
BARBARA: Thank God!
TRAFFIC COP: Evenin' ma'am.
BARBARA: Please help me, they've got my boyfriend's corpse and they're going to perform a ritual with his body.
TRAFFIC COP: May I see your driving license please, ma'am?
BARBARA: My driving license?
TRAFFIC COP: I've just told you that they've stolen a body and you want to see my driving license?
BARBARA: I've just told you that they've stolen a body and you want to see my driving license?
TRAFFIC COP: Yes it is, ma'am. And yes I am.
PHIL: Cap Rock. This is perfect. Really peaceful.
PHIL: You wanna give me a hand here?
LARRY: What now?
PHIL: Now we. do it.
LARRY: Flesh burns easier than wood.
PHIL: Flesh burns easier than wood.
LARRY: I can't believe you just said that. I'm not taking the top
PHIL: ( to Gram ) Hey, man. Looking a little Some decorum would be nice.
SUSIE: Some decorum would be nice.
PHIL: He pours some gasoline into the casket.
LARRY: Well, I don't know. Maybe a little more.
PHIL: I'm not having a conversation with you about how much gasoline you need to burn a body.
SUSIE: I'm not having a conversation with you about how much gasoline you need to burn a body.
LARRY: I think that'll do it.
PHIL: Only a little left.
TRAFFIC COP: Jesus! What the hell's that?
BARBARA: That'll be Gram Parsons, on fire.
TRAFFIC COP: Get in the car, ma'am. Now.
LARRY: Maybe too much fuel.
PHIL: Nah, I just didn't factor in the booze inside of him. Gram
PHIL: CON TINUE D: The huge car screeches off into the darkness, with no INT. CAR. NIGHT Stanley watches as the hearse flies past him. He glances back at the fire, smiles sadly, and bows his head for a moment. Then he turns on the ignition and drives away into the darkness.
TRAFFIC COP: How do you know it's your I recognize that birthmark on his shoulder. Look, can I make an Be my guest.
BARBARA: ( sarcastically ) I recognize that birthmark on his shoulder. Look, can I make an Be my guest.
TRAFFIC COP: Be my guest.
BARBARA: We're in the desert. It is dark. If you want to catch someone in the dark, it's best not to turn on big flashing lights and make a loud noise with a siren.
TRAFFIC COP: Do you want to know what I think, No. But I'm really, really keen to find out.
BARBARA: No. But I'm really, really keen to find out.
TRAFFIC COP: I think it was suicide. He just wanted to get away from you.
GRAM: Sure is hot.
PHIL: Hello, Gram.
GRAM: Gram pulls himself along the bay and onto the back seat. He then climbs into the front, settles next to Phil and holds his hand out for the flask.
PHIL: Do you think you should?
GRAM: Not gonna hurt me now, is it?
PHIL: They're very handy for transporting dead people around. Nothing better.
GRAM: I am dead, then?
PHIL: You're more than dead, Gram. You and the box are down to bones and Oh, well. Here's mud in your
GRAM: Oh, well. Here's mud in your
PHIL: What can I do for you, Gram?
GRAM: You assume I want something.
PHIL: Well, you're here. And seeing as I just burned you to a cinder, you shouldn't be.
GRAM: Well, okay. I just wanted to say What for?
PHIL: What for?
GRAM: Doing the thing that we agreed, keeping your word, keeping them all away.
PHIL: Well, that's okay, Gram. But I don't need thanking.
GRAM: You don't?
PHIL: I'm just taking care of business. That's what you paid me for - that's what I do.
GRAM: You shooting for a raise?
PHIL: Actually, I just quit.
GRAM: Well, I s'pose I should be getting along.
PHIL: Goodbye, Gram. I'm glad it all worked out.
GRAM: I said I'm glad it all worked
PHIL: I said I'm glad it all worked
LARRY: All what worked out?
PHIL: Doesn't matter. Can we go now? I'm getting sick of sand.
LARRY: Well, we did it. We saved a
PHIL: Singed my damn mustache, that's for sure.
LARRY: Well, shall we?
PHIL: Yeah. Let's roll, hippie.
PHIL: Where d'you think you might be when I'm done?
SUSIE: I'll be waiting.
PHIL: Yeah, but where?
SUSIE: Get out of here. Finish it.
