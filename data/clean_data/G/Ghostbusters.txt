ACT ONE: FADE IN: EXT. A FARMHOUSE OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY NIGHT On the farmhouse roof a CHICKEN-SHAPED WEATHERVANE stands silhouetted against a FULL, BLOOD-RED MOON. The wind HOWLS and the vane swivels with an EERIE SQUEAK. Then a weird ANIMAL CRY is hearda cross between a chicken CROWING and a wolf HOWLING.
CHICKEN PEN: A fenced-in dirt area with numerous CHICKENS milling around, CLUCKING as they peck at the ground.
ZEKE: Sump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude.
MAUDE: Jes' set easy, Zeke. I'll take a look-see. Zeke continues staring at TV.
MAUDE: ( as she goes ) Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.
MAUDE: What's got you girls so durned upset? There a coyote sneakin' 'round? Suddenly the Werechicken's shadow moves up Maude's back, then the wall.
MAUDE: ( GASP! ) MAUDE'S POV THE WERECHICKEN Red-eyed, grotesque, three times the size of an ordinary rooster as it stands framed in the moonlit doorway. It opens its fanged beak in a horrifying SHRIEK as it springs AT CAMERA, wings flapping.
WERECHICKEN: ( Frightening SHRIEK )
TV WEREWOLF: ( eerie HOWL )
ZEKE: ( without looking up ) Everythin' okay out there, Maude?
ZEKE: ( SCREAMS ) He scrambles backwards off the couch.
RAY: And Winston's in the kitchen doing your ANGLE ON EGON He's busy testing his WEATHER BALLOONa large, pink bubble half the size of the room. He moves a lever on its remote control unit and the balloon Be with you in . .one minute, fifty-three seconds.

ANOTHER ANGLE: Peter and Ray exchange pained glances. Peter awkwardly attempts to pick up another trash bag while Ray stumbles around, his vision blocked. PAN WITH THEM as they move toward door when Egon's weather balloon suddenly lowers INTO FRAME. They bounce into and off of it, which sends the trash bags flying.
NEW ANGLE: Peter stumbles backwards and lands butt-first right on one of the bags. Slimer SQUEALS from within it.

WINSTON: ( sarcastic ) Nevermind, Egon, wouldn't want you to strain yourself. ( picks up phone ) Ghostbusters Central.
WINSTON: Calm down. Where are you?. We'll be right there. He hangs up.
WIDER ANGLE: Peter and Ray again have their arms full of trash bags. Even Slimer is dragging one.
WINSTON: Ready for this one? Some farmer says his wife was eaten by a giant chicken.
PETER: Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds better than doing Egon's chores. Let's roll! Ray and Slimer also abandon their trash bags and EXIT with Peter and REAR VIEW ON EGON still oblivious as he works in the suddenly empty room.
EGON: I think I've finally perfected it. Watch this, guys. EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT ECTO-1 roars INTO CAMERA, siren and lights going.

WERECHICKEN'S POV: Through its RED EYES we see, from a distance, Peter and Slimer carrying the egg, Ray and Winston moving off in other direction.
PETER: ( through above ) Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work for you: How about analyzing this?
ANOTHER ANGLE: Egon looks around, reacts to egg.
EGON: Interesting. That's the second biggest egg I've ever seen. Peter and Slimer set egg on Egon's desk.
PETER: I don't wanna hear about it, Egon. We've had a long night in a not-too-fragrant barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting the sheets. Peter EXITS as Slimer ZIPS in close beside Egon, elbows on desk, chin in hands, eyeing Egon and egg expectantly. Egon pushes glasses up off tip of nose and blinks at egg, not sure what to do with it.

ANOTHER ANGLE: Suddenly the door SLAMS shut behind them and the FLAP OF BEATING WINGS SCURRIES through the darkness. Winston JUMPS.
WINSTON: Look out! Ray shines his flashlight toward the lofts. Its beam catches a couple of startled pigeons as they fly out the window, pinion feathers WHISTLING.
WERECHICKEN'S POV: RED-TINTED, moving slowly toward Ray and Winston from behind.

FULL SHOT: The proton streams catch the Werechicken in mid-air as it vaults toward Ray and Winston, halting its leap and suspending it in a corona of proton A HIDEOUS SPIRIT rises from its writhing body shapeless, but with monstrous glowing eyes and fangs. The spirit lets out a ROAR more frightening than the Werechicken howl.

WINSTON: Ray, I just had a thought. Ray pauses to look around at Winston.

SLIMER: Egon closes fridge.
SLIMER: ( big YAWN ) G'night, Egon. Slimer floats off.
EGON: Goodnight, Slimer.
SLIMER: ( SNORING ) CLOSE ON SLIMER In a BUBBLE above him, we see Slimer's DREAM, various kinds of food dancing and SINGING the first two bars of Los Lobos' "LA BAMBA" a la the California Raisins in "I Heard It Through The Grapevine." Still asleep, Slimer licks his lips hungrily, opens his mouth incredibly wide and pounces on the entire dream balloon with a teeth-jarring CHOMP! that POPS the dream bubble so that it EXPLODES inside his mouth, waking him up. Slimer sits up with a wide-eyed, hungry look, rubbing his tummy.
SLIMER: He zips o.s.
SLIMER: ( licking his lips ) Slimer rolls egg toward edge of shelf, then the full weight of the egg drives Slimer straight to the floor. The egg bounces on his stomach twice before he gets a grip on it. Straining his little green brains out, he floats the egg up into the air and o.s.
SLIMER: ( SQUEALS, then GRUNTS )

EGON: ( looking around ) ( CACKLING fading into distance )
ON EGON: Dazed, he looks down at his feet.
CLOSE SHOTS: As Egon's transformation continues: His coveralls RIP apart at the legs, then midriff, then his arms turn into wings. Finally, a beak sprouts from his face.
PETER: ( CALLS ) ( to Slimer ) Well, Slimer, I don't see anything here that looks like a monster. The Egon-Chicken jumps out right in front of Peter and Slimer.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Slimer freaks and rockets right through the nearest wall.
