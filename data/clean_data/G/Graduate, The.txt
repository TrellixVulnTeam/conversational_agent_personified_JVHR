"THE GRADUATE": Screenplay by Prod. No. 20055
FINAL DRAFT: March 29, 1967 Property of:
BEN: - and today it is right that we should ask ourselves the one most important question: What is the purpose of these years, the purpose for all this demanding work, the purpose for the sacrifices made those who love us? Were there NOT a purpose, then all of these past years of struggle, of fierce competition and of uncom- promising ambition would be mean- ingless. But, of course, there is a purpose and I must tell it to you. I ask you to remember this purpose always and I pledge that I shall endeavor to carry it with me forever.
BEN: ( continuing ) The purpose, my fellow graduates - the purpose is - He stops, trying to think of the word.
BEN: - there is a reason, my friends, and the reason is -
BEN: - the reason is - the purpose is - SOUND of the WIND becoming the ROAR of an AIRCRAFT coming at us through the air.
CAPTAIN'S VOICE: Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin our descent into Los Angeles - SOUND of a SONIC BOOM.
CAPTAIN'S VOICE: The sound you have just heard is the landing gear locking into place. The Los Angeles weather is clear and the temperature is a pleasant 72. We do not expect any traffic delay and will make our four hour and eighteen minute flight plan smack on the nose. We enjoyed having you on board and look forward to seeing you again in the near 18 SHOT PULL BACK SLOWLY from a CLOSEUP of a television screen with snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the ceiling of the aircraft. There is snow on all of them.

STEWARDESS' VOICE: Ladies and gentlemen please fasten your seat belts in preparation for the landing and observe the no smoking sign. After we land, you will notice an increase in the sound level as the thrust of the engines is reversed to help reduce forward speed.

MR. CARLSON: The girls. The chicks. The - the teeny boppers.
MRS. CARLSON: I think Ben has gotten beyond the teeny bopper stage - haven't you, Ben? Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink. Ben tries to smile and return the wink politely.
BEN: Yes, ma'am. They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs.
BEN: Excuse me - I think I'd just like to check something on the car for a minute - Ben moves to the front door and opens it. MR. LOOMIS steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand.

BEN: Excuse me just a minute - Ben goes into the house through the back door.
MRS. ROBINSON: Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
BEN: It's down the hall. They stand for a moment, loocking at each other.
MRS. ROBINSON: How are you, Benjamin?
BEN: Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall. Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge of the bed.
BEN: Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't mean to be rude but - Mrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and lights it.
MRS. ROBINSON: Is there an ashtray in here?

BEN: Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
MRS. ROBINSON: Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
BEN: Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
MRS. ROBINSON: I'm very nuerotic. She turns on the phonograph. SOUND of PHONOGRAPH.
MRS. ROBINSON: May I ask you a question? Ben looks at her.
MRS. ROBINSON: What do you think of me?
BEN: What do you mean?
MRS. ROBINSON: You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.

BEN: Oh my God.
MRS. ROBINSON: Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
BEN: Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
MRS. ROBINSON: What's wrong?
BEN: Mrs. Robinson, you didn't - I mean you didn't expect -
MRS. ROBINSON: I mean - you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
BEN: I mean - you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
MRS. ROBINSON: Like what?
BEN: What do you think?
MRS. ROBINSON: Well I don't know.
BEN: For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
MRS. ROBINSON: Mrs. Robinson - you are trying to seduce me. There is a pause. She looks at him.
BEN: Mrs. Robinson - you are trying to seduce me. There is a pause. She looks at him.
BEN: ( weaker ) Aren't you?
MRS. ROBINSON: Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you -
BEN: Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
MRS. ROBINSON: It's all right.
BEN: It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
MRS. ROBINSON: Sit down.
BEN: Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
MRS. ROBINSON: All right. Now finish your drink.
BEN: Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
MRS. ROBINSON: We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
BEN: What is wrong with me?
MRS. ROBINSON: Have you ever seen Elaine's Her portrait?
BEN: Her portrait?
MRS. ROBINSON: MRS. ROBINSON We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
BEN: MRS. ROBINSON We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
MRS. ROBINSON: We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
BEN: Very much. We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom, into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to the doorway to Elaine's room.
BEN: Elaine certainly is an attractive girl, isn't she? In the b.g. Mrs. Robinson watches him.
BEN: ( looking at the portrait ) I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
MRS. ROBINSON: MRS. ROBINSON Will you unzip my dress? He steps back.
BEN: MRS. ROBINSON Will you unzip my dress? He steps back.
MRS. ROBINSON: Will you unzip my dress? He steps back.
MRS. ROBINSON: I think I'll go to bed.
BEN: Oh. Well, goodnight.
MRS. ROBINSON: Won't you unzip my dress?
BEN: I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
MRS. ROBINSON: If you still think I'm trying to seduce you -
BEN: No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin - you've known me all your life.
BEN: I know that. But I'm -
MRS. ROBINSON: Come on. She turns her back.
MRS. ROBINSON: It's hard for me to reach. Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down.
MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you.
BEN: Ben walks toward the door.
MRS. ROBINSON: What are you so scared of?
BEN: I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
MRS. ROBINSON: Then why do you keep running Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here. Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.
BEN: Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here. Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.
MRS. ROBINSON: Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
BEN: Yes, I have - He looks up at the portrait of Elaine.
BEN: But I just - Look - what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
MRS. ROBINSON: What if he did?
BEN: Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
MRS. ROBINSON: Don't you think he trusts us Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
BEN: Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
MRS. ROBINSON: I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think -
BEN: But they would! Don't you see?
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin - I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd -
BEN: I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
MRS. ROBINSON: Why is it?
BEN: Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't -
MRS. ROBINSON: Would you like me to seduce you?
BEN: MRS. ROBINSON Is that what you're trying to tell me?
MRS. ROBINSON: Is that what you're trying to tell me?
BEN: I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now. Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall. The CAMERA PUSHES with him to the door. We see the entire stairway and part of the downstairs hall. Ben gets to the stairs and starts down.
BENJAMIN?: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Will you bring up my purse before you go?
BEN: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Will you bring up my purse before you go?
BEN: I have to go now. I'm sorry. Mrs. Robinson walks into the hall. Her back is to us. She is holding her dress in front of her.
MRS. ROBINSON: I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it Where is it?
BEN: Where is it?
MRS. ROBINSON: On that chair in the hall. She walks out of the shot.
BEN: Mrs. Robinson?
BEN: Well here's the purse.
BEN: Well I'll hand it to you. Ben starts back up the stairs.
BEN: Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
BEN: I'm putting it on the top step.
BEN: I'm putting it here by the door.
BEN: I'd rather not.
BEN: 38 INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT
BEN: Oh God. She smiles.
BEN: Let me out. She turns the lock on the door.
MRS. ROBINSON: Don't be nervous.
BEN: Get away from that door.
MRS. ROBINSON: I want to say something first.
BEN: Jesus Christ!
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin - I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time -
BEN: Oh my God.
MRS. ROBINSON: If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
BEN: Let me out!
MRS. ROBINSON: Do you understand what I said?
BEN: Yes. Yes. Let me out!
MRS. ROBINSON: Because I find you very attractive and any time - There is the SOUND of a CAR in the driveway outside. Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside, struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into the hall and down the stairs.
BEN: ( jumping up ) Yes, sir! FOOTSTEPS approach the sunroom. MR. ROBINSON enters.
BEN: I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I - I drove her home.
MR. ROBINSON: Swell. I appreciate it.

MR. ROBINSON: I've got to go.
BEN: I've got to go.
MR. ROBINSON: Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
BEN: No. No - I'm just - I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future. Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him.
MR. ROBINSON: Come on. Let's have a nightcap Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks. Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie and checks to see if his fly is okay. Mr. Robinson turns and brings him the drink.
BEN: Thank you very much, sir.
MR. ROBINSON: Ben - how old are you now?
BEN: Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
MR. ROBINSON: ( taking out a cigarette ) That's a hell of a good age to be.
BEN: Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON: I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben -
BEN: MR. ROBINSON You'll never be young again.
MR. ROBINSON: You'll never be young again.
BEN: I know.
MR. ROBINSON: Ben, can I say something to How long have we known each other now? Ben shakes his head.
BEN: MR. ROBINSON How long have we known each other now? Ben shakes his head.

MR. ROBINSON: How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
BEN: Quite a while.
MR. ROBINSON: I've watched you grow up, Ben.
BEN: Yes, sir.
MR. ROBINSON: In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
BEN: Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON: So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
BEN: I'd like to hear it.
MR. ROBINSON: Ben - I think - I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem Ben nods.
MR. ROBINSON: Sow a few wild oats. Take things as they come. Have a good time with the girls and so forth. Mrs. Robinson enters the room. She is now wearing the dress she wore earlier. Ben starts to get up.
MRS. ROBINSON: Don't get up. Ben sits.
MR. ROBINSON: I was just telling Ben here he ought to sow a few wild oats. Have a good time while he can. You think that's sound advice? Mrs. Robinson nods.
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes, I do.
BEN: I've got to go. He stands. Mr. Robinson stands up with him.
MR. ROBINSON: You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
BEN: Oh no.
MR. ROBINSON: What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes, he does. They start out of the sunroom.
MR. ROBINSON: Oh say - Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.

MR. ROBINSON: Mr. Robinson opens the front door and Ben goes out.
MRS. ROBINSON: MRS. ROBINSON Thank you for taking me home. Ben nods.
BEN: MRS. ROBINSON Thank you for taking me home. Ben nods.
MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you for taking me home. Ben nods.
MRS. ROBINSON: I'll see you soon, I hope. Ben continues to walk toward us.
MR. BRADDOCK: Hey, over there I mean you! Your attention please! Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the house, the window into the kitchen. He speaks quickly - in a fake sotto voce - towards the window.
MR. BRADDOCK: Are you ready in there, feature Could I speak to you for a second, But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window and is readdressing his audience.
BEN'S VOICE: Could I speak to you for a second, But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window and is readdressing his audience.
MR. BRADDOCK: - what was I saying?
MRS. ARNOLD: Feature attraction.
MR. BRADDOCK: Right. Hey - I'm glad to see you're paying attention. A feature attraction that will be one of the most astounding events ever to take place in this particular backyard. They all laugh and some applaud.
MR. BRADDOCK: Now I'm going to ask for a big round of applause to bring this boy out here - wait a minute - let me amend that - to bring this young man out here - because today he is twenty-one-years- old -
MR. ARNOLD: ( his hands like a megaphone ) Let's get on with the show!
MR. BRADDOCK: Just hang on a minute because I have a few words to say -
MR. ARNOLD: You always do. They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy Dad - could we just talk about this for a second?
BEN'S VOICE: Dad - could we just talk about this for a second?
MR. BRADDOCK: Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning -
MR. ARNOLD: Bring him out!
MR. BRADDOCK: ( to the window ) I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
BEN'S VOICE: I'd like to discuss this.
MR. BRADDOCK: ( to his audience ) This boy - I'm sorry - this young man - is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halping- ham Award Scholar - but before he does - Mr. Braddock darts back to the window.
MR. BRADDOCK: - before he does - You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
BEN'S VOICE: Dad - can you listen -
MR. BRADDOCK: ( meaning it ) I'll give you ten seconds. ( back to the people ) He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present - and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks - so let's hear it for - Mr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open. It slams against the wall inside.
MR. BRADDOCK: - Benjamin Braddock!
MR. BRADDOCK: Folks - this remarkable young man is going to perform for you some spectacular and amazing feats of daring in water that is over six feet deep - Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down. We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD down the hall. Everything is slightly distorted through the glass. Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it. SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be applauding and chattering noiselessly. We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool. Mr. Braddock is running back and forth, clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch. We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the pool. Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool, motioning toward us to come down to the deep end. He joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool. They both begin to motion us toward them. We get to the deep end of the pool. Mr. Braddock signals us with his hand to go under. He kneels down by the edge of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us under. He has a big smile. We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look. The figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling; the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees, smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under. We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.
BEN: Mrs. Robinson - I don't quite know how to put this -
BEN: Look - I was thinking about that time after the party -
BEN: - and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something -
BEN: Uh - The Taft Hotel.
BEN: No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather -
BEN: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE I'll be there in an hour. SOUND of her HANGING UP. Ben hangs up slowly. He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and carrying it folded across his arm in front of him, leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that lead to the main lobby. As he is about to go in, the doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering to each other and helping each other out of the door and down the steps. Ben holds one of the doors open for them and stands politely to one side. As they get through, Ben starts to move inside. At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push him to one side and move past him into the lobby. He moves back against the other door, holding it open and allowing them to go in first. He smiles politely and they pay no attention to him at all. He follows them into the lobby. They move toward the front desk and he moves with them. One of the boys at the front of the group leans in and says something to the CLERK behind the desk. The clerk points across the lobby and says something to him. There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some- where. The group of young people passes by the desk and Ben moves in behind them. He pauses at the desk and looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the keys dangling suggestively.
ROOM CLERK: Can I help you, sir!
BEN: What? Oh - no - I'm just - He points vaguely in the direction of the other young Are you here for an affair, Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes. He looks helplessly at the clerk.
ROOM CLERK: Are you here for an affair, Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes. He looks helplessly at the clerk.
BEN: ROOM CLERK The Singleman party, sir?
ROOM CLERK: The Singleman party, sir?
BEN: Oh - yes. The Singleman party.
ROOM CLERK: It's in the main ballroom.
BEN: Ahh - thank you. Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby. He puts on his jacket as he goes. He gets to the entrance to the main ballroom. He pauses at the door, looks in. What he sees: People dancing, talking, sitting, etc. He turns back toward te lobby. He stops. What he sees: The room clerk scross the lobby watching Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.
VOICE: Ben turns. Four people stand in a row. Official greeters, they are: A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, AN OLDER MAN, AN ELDERLY LADY AND A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD BOY, dressed formally and they are smiling with great determination.
BEN: It is the older lady who has said hello.
MRS. SINGLEMAN: You must be one of the Porters. She grasps Ben's hand and shakes it.
BEN: No - actually I'm not -
MRS. SINGLEMAN: I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte - MISS DEWITTE, who, from the looks of things, always has been and always will be, Miss DeWitte, takes Ben's hand. How do you do?
BEN: How do you do, Miss DeWitte?
MRS. SINGLEMAN: - and my husband, Mr. Singleman - Ben finds himself shaking the twelve-year-old boy's Oh - sorry -

BEN: Of course you did. She shakes her head.
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
BEN: Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.

MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you.
BEN: Well don't thank me, because I want you to. There is a long pause.
MRS. ROBINSON: But you won't ever take out Elaine, will you? I want you to promise me that. There is another long pause.
BEN: Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occured to me to take her out.
MRS. ROBINSON: Then give me your word you won't.
BEN: This is absurd.
MRS. ROBINSON: Promise me, Benjamin.
BEN: All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you. Benjamin -
BEN: Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all. At opposite sides of the room, without looking at each other, they begin to take off their clothes.
FADE OUT: FADE IN 92 INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking at the back of a cereal box. Mr. and Mrs. Braddock are there.
FADE IN: 92 INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY
MR. BRADDOCK: Elaine's back from school. I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out. Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues eating and reading.
MRS. BRADDOCK: Don't you think that she's a terribly attractive girl? Because I think she's one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen. Ben gives a small whimper.
MRS. BRADDOCK: It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's ackward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
BEN: Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
MR. BRADDOCK: I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
BEN: Look - Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
MR. BRADDOCK: How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too That has nothing to do with it -
BEN: That has nothing to do with it -
MR. BRADDOCK: I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening - doing God knows what -
MRS. BRADDOCK: Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out -
BEN: I do.
MRS. BRADDOCK: - then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on 95 SHOT - BEN He slides off the raft and goes underwater.
BEN: I'll go call Elaine now. Mr. and Mrs. Braddock cling exhausted to the raft and try to smile at each other. SOUND: Ding dong of the Robinson door chimes.
MR. ROBINSON: Well, Braddock - it's about time you got around to this. Come on in. I'm afraid the young lady isn't quite ready yet - Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom. Mrs. Robinson is sitting there.
BEN: MR. ROBINSON What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
MR. ROBINSON: What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
BEN: Mr. Robinson hands him drink.
MR. ROBINSON: I'll see if she's ready. Mr. Robinson exits.
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin I thought I made ELAINE'S VOICE myself perfectly clear about Daddy - can you fix this? this. The clasp is broken I think.
MRS. ROBINSON: But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin. Mr. Robinson and ELAINE enter.
ELAINE: 101 CLOSEUP - MRS. ROBINSON
BEN: 101 CLOSEUP - MRS. ROBINSON
ELAINE: You're living at home now. Is that right?
BEN: Do you know what you're going to do?
ELAINE: Do you know what you're going to do?
BEN: Are you going to graduate school?
ELAINE: Are you going to graduate school?
BEN: He leans on the HORN. The car directly ahead of him does not move to the right. Ben jerks his car over to the right, swerves around the car ahead, jamming his horn down, and swerves back into the outside lane, giving the driver of the other car an angry look as he passes him. Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance.
ELAINE: Do you always drive like this?
BEN: CUT TO: 103 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT A drab, almost deserted room with formally dressed WAITERS. Ben and Elaine are seated at a table.
BEN: Do you want some dinner?
ELAINE: I'd love some. A waiter moves forward toward them.
BEN: Bring a menu.
WAITER #2: Dinner for two, sir?
BEN: No. Just for her. The waiter moves away.
ELAINE: Aren't you eating?
BEN: Why not?
ELAINE: Why not?
BEN: If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry. The waiter returns with a menu.
ELAINE: I've changed my mind. Thank 104 EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT - SHOTS Ben and Elaine walking on the strip.
BEN: Sit down. Elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage. She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them. Ben takes a pair of dark glasses out of his pocket and puts them on. The two chairs are slightly angled toward each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without looking directly at Elaine.
BEN: Why don't you watch the show? The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses.
ELAINE: Benjamin - do you dislike me for some reason?
BEN: No - why should I?
ELAINE: I don't know.
BEN: You're missing a great effect Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns How do you like that? Elaine doesn't answer.
BEN: How do you like that? Elaine doesn't answer.
BEN: Could you do it?
ELAINE: The stripper sees Elaine look. The stripper smiles toward Ben and walks toward his table, twirling the tassels as she walks. Ben smiles as he watches her approaching. The stripper moves directly behind Elaine's chair. The spotlight from the back of the house falls into Elaine's face. As it does, Elaine puts her hand up to shield her eyes. The stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it and holds it up in the air. The music stops and a DRUM ROLL starts. The stripper bends over Elaine's head and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in front of Elaine's face.
STRIPPER: Some of the customers start to boo. Ben rises, takes Elaine's arm and leads her toward the exit.
BEN: Elaine - I'm sorry. Elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls her arm away.
ELAINE: Will you take me home now?
BEN: I'm sorry I took you in there.
ELAINE: I think I'd better go home now But, Elaine -
BEN: But, Elaine -
ELAINE: Where is the car?
BEN: I just want to tell you something. Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying to get her to look at him. She keeps looking away.
ELAINE: I want to go home.
BEN: But could I just tell you this one thing?
ELAINE: This whole idea - this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
BEN: This whole idea - this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
ELAINE: Oh - that's very nice of you to tell me.
BEN: No. What I mean is - that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this. She starts to cry. People on the sidewalk are looking at them. She turns away from them. Ben moves away from them. Ben moves around in front of her.
BEN: Listen - could you stop crying, No, I couldn't.
ELAINE: No, I couldn't.
BEN: But could you try?
ELAINE: She brings both hands up to her face. Ben looks at her for a few moments in agony. Then, very determined, he takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from her face. She looks up startled. She starts to give a little cry but before she can he is kissing her. She closes her eyes. He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side of her face. He opens his hands against her face, freeing her hands. Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang on. After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly to one side.
BEN: Elaine - He starts to pull her head back.
ELAINE: Not here. Not here.
BEN: I've had this feeling - ever since I've graduated - this - kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
ELAINE: Yes, I do. He looks at her.
BEN: It's like I've been playing some kind of - game - but the rules don't make any sense to me - She is watching him carefully.
BEN: - they're being made up by all the wrong people - no - I mean no one makes them up, they seem to have made themselves up. A car with a COUPLE OF TEENAGERS has driven up in the slot on their right. Its RADIO is tuned into a rock and roll station and it is playing LOUDLY. Ben leans across Elaine and speaks through the window to the kid behind the wheel.
BEN: Say - I wonder if I could request you to turn that down a little? The kid turns the radio up. Ben and Elaine roll their windows up.
ELAINE: Well - maybe I'd better go in. He nods. They continue to sit there for another long Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
ELAINE: Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
BEN: No, I mean - I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
ELAINE: We won't. Let's go inside.
BEN: Wait a minute.
ELAINE: Is anything wrong?
BEN: No - I was just thinking - look - it's still early - we could do something - go somewhere else.
ELAINE: All right. He starts the car immediately and drives away from the 119 INT. BEN'S CAR - NIGHT Ben is driving.
ELAINE: Where we going?
BEN: I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
ELAINE: Isn't there one in the Taft There is a SQUEAL of TIRES as Ben almost drives off the road.
ELAINE: What is the matter?
BEN: Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
BEN: Listen, Elaine - it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean - as far as I know.

MRS. ROBINSON: Drive down the block.
BEN: Mrs. Robinson - I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
MRS. ROBINSON: ( looking at him for the first time ) Do exactly what I say. Ben starts the car forward down the driveway.
BEN: Now it seems to me -
MRS. ROBINSON: Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear? Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down the block.

MRS. ROBINSON: In order to keep Elaine away from you - I am prepared to tell her everything.

MRS. ROBINSON: Then you'd better start believing me.
BEN: Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
MRS. ROBINSON: Go home now.
BEN: I just don't believe you would do that. Mrs. Robinson looks at him for a moment.
MRS. ROBINSON: Try me. There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression. Then he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on his side and jumps out of the car, carrying the package. TRACK WITH BEN as he runs up the street and up the drive- way toward the Robinson house. Ben gets to the front 126 INT. ROBINSON HALLS, STAIRS, DOOR TO ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY Ben runs in.

ELAINE: Oh - no. Ben backs up.
BEN: Elaine -
ELAINE: Oh my God - Moving along the wall as though to keep as far from Ben as possible, Elaine moves away from the door.

MRS. BRADDOCK: But what makes you think she wants to marry you? Ben picks up his suitcase, walks to the door and turns.
BEN: She doesn't. To be perfectly honest, she doesn't like me.
BEN'S VOICE: ( over ) Dear Elaine - I am now visiting Berkeley, after growing somewhat weary of family life. I have been meaning to stop by and pay my respects but am not entirely certain just how you feel about seeing me after the incident involving myself and your mother.

He crosses to the wastepaper basket under the sink, bends down and takes a newspaper out of it. He crosses to the chair and sits down. He holds the newspaper in front of him. It is hopelessly crumpled. He gets up, crosses to the bureau, opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron. He kneels down, puts the newspaper on the floor and tires to straighten it out with the iron. There is a KNOCK on the door.

BEN: What for? Because I don't like you. Mr. McCleery disappears down the stairs. Ben turns and goes back into the room.
ELAINE: I'm sorry I screamed. Ben opens the suitcase.
ELAINE: Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
BEN: Elaine - right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now. He stands, looking into the empty suitcase.

TELEGRAM: addressed to MR. BENJAMIN BRADDOCK SOUND: FOOTSTEPS descending stairs. Someone WHISTLING. The FOOTSTEPS and WHISTLING get nearer and stop. Hands come in and pick up telegram, open the envelope and unfold, the telegram reads:
BEN: We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
ELAINE: Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
BEN: Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
ELAINE: Benjamin - I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
BEN: We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours? They move up the steps of a classroom building. Ben pushes through a lot of students to keep up with Elaine.
ELAINE: I just don't think it would work.
BEN: Why wouldn't it? A bell rings. Elaine turns into one of the doors. Ben is left in the hall. He looks around. All the doors in the classrooms close. He leans against the wall.
BEN: Why wouldn't it?
ELAINE: I just don't think it would. Elaine starts walking down the corridor towards the exit door. Ben follows her, moving out of the way of the other students.
BEN: Tomorrow then - can we get our blood tests tomorrow morning? She turns and looks at him.
ELAINE: Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
BEN: Why don't I just drag you off? All right - I will. Right after we get the blood Well - I have to see Carl first.
ELAINE: Well - I have to see Carl first.
BEN: Carl who? Elaine jumps up, applauding a shot.
BEN: Carl who?
ELAINE: Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
BEN: Who - that guy at the Zoo?
ELAINE: Why do you have to see him?
BEN: Why do you have to see him?
ELAINE: Well I said I might marry him. Elaine and several other girls run onto the court as a number of girls run off the court to the bench.
BEN: ( yelling after her ) You WHAT?
BEN: How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
ELAINE: No, Benjamin.
BEN: Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
ELAINE: He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
BEN: Oh no. He said that.
ELAINE: Where did he do it? She starts to get up.
BEN: Where did he do it? She starts to get up.
BEN: I'd like to know where it happened? She starts to move away.
BEN: It wasn't in his car, was it?
BEN: Are we getting married tomorrow?
ELAINE: The day after tomorrow?
BEN: The day after tomorrow?
ELAINE: Maybe we are and maybe we aren't. She goes through the doorway into Wendell Hall. Ben remains standing in exactly the same positin. After a few moments the door opens and Elaine comes out, steps quickly to Ben, kisses him, then runs back inside. Ben turns and starts away from the door. The door opens again. Ben turns back and takes a step toward the door, smiling expectantly. A tall bearded MAN comes out and goes past Ben. Ben breaks up.
MR. ROBINSON: ( clearing his throat ) Do you want - do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
BEN: Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON: Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
BEN: No, it's not
MR. ROBINSON: Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you It was nothing to do with you, sir.
BEN: It was nothing to do with you, sir.
MR. ROBINSON: Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me. Ben takes a step forward.
BEN: Now look - please -
MR. ROBINSON: Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
BEN: I am not threatening you.
MR. ROBINSON: Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
BEN: I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
MR. ROBINSON: You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
BEN: No, I don't.
MR. ROBINSON: Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
BEN: But why?
MR. ROBINSON: It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
BEN: It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
MR. ROBINSON: That's quite a statement.
BEN: Listen to me. We got - we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might - we might just as well have been shaking hands.
MR. ROBINSON: Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
BEN: You miss the point.
MR. ROBINSON: Don't shout at me, Ben.
BEN: The point is - I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
MR. ROBINSON: Well - I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you -
BEN: MR. ROBINSON I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure. Mr. Robinson climbs across the bed to get to the door. Ben takes a step toward him.

MR. ROBINSON: Stay away from me, Ben! Mr. Robinson stands at the door.
MR. ROBINSON: I don't want to mince words with you. As far as Elaine's concerned you're to get her out of your filthy mind right now. Is that perfectly clear ro you? That's all, Ben. You'll pardon me if I don't shake hands with you. Mr. Robinson opens the door and starts into the hall.
MR. ROBINSON: I think you are filth. Mr. Robinson turns back from the hall.
MR. ROBINSON: I think you are scum. Mr. Robinson starts down the stairs. Mr. McCleery is standing on the stairway, listening.
MR. ROBINSON: You are a degenerate! Mr. Robinson turns and goes down the stairs, past Mr. McCleery who looks up at Ben.
BEN: Mr. McCleery - do you have some change? I need to use the phone? I want you out of here.
BEN: ( takes out some money ) Look - I'll give you ten dollars for a dime - I'll give you twenty - for God's sake, will you let me use that phone? I am going to call the police now.
BEN: Could I make one phone call first? Get out! Ben stuffs the money back in his pocket and runs down the stairs and out of the building. Through the door we see him run down the street and out of sight.
ELAINE'S VOICE: ( over ) Dear Benjamin - I promise you some- say I will write a long letter about everything but right now I can't thank and all I can say to you is please forgive me because I know what I'm doing is the best thing for you. My father is so upset you've got to understand. I love you, but it would never work out.

MRS. ROBINSON: I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed -
BEN: What the hell have you done? SOUND of SEVERAL CARS TURNING INTO DRIVEWAY.
MRS. ROBINSON: Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
BEN: I'll find her.
MRS. ROBINSON: I don't think so. The cars have reached the top of the driveway. SOUND of the SQUEAL of BRAKES and CAR DOORS OPENING.
BEN: Wedding! God Damn it - wedding! People are YELLING as him from the cars going by.
CARL'S VOICE: Your father's right, Elaine. You and I will make a darned good team. Ben swings the car around in a U-turn and speeds off in the other direction.

CARTER'S VOICE: I don't know. Maybe at his old man's home.
BEN: MAN AT SINK Give the bride a message for me. Tell her to act surprised. A great deal of laughter follows this gem.
BEN: Do you have a phone? The attendant points. Ben reaches for the phone book hanging under the pay phone.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Hello - who is this?
BEN: Hello - who is this?
WOMAN'S VOICE: This is Dr. Smith's answering service.

ATTENDANT: You need any gas, Father?
BEN: I'm not a priest - I'm a minister. The car drives out of the station.
BEN: Running across the street. He stops for a moment and looks around. There are a number of cars parked in front of the church. Among them is Mrs. Robinson's car. Ben runs by it and up the steps to the front doors of the church.
BEN: Oh, Jesus - God - no - He puts his hands up against the glass and slumps. The minister shakes hands with Carl, then takes Elaine's hand. The ORGAN music starts to THUNDER.
BEN: ( straightening ) He moves to the center of the window and begins to POUND on the glass.
BEN: Elaine - Elaine! Ben's shadow is thrown across the celebrants. They all turn around and look up at him.
CARL: Who is that guy? What's he doing?
MR. ROBINSON: I'll take care of him.
MRS. ROBINSON: He's too late. The other guests are adlibbing their confusion.
ELAINE: ( screaming ) The SOUND of the ORGAN and the guests' VOICES starts again.
BEN: Come on - don't faint.
BEN: Out of my way! Carl steps in and grabs Ben from behind. Ben breaks Carl's hold and picks up a gold cross off a nearby stand. He begins to swing it, advancing toward Carl. Carl backs up toward the other guests.
