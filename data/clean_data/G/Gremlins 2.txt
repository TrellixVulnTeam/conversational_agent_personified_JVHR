MR. WING: I'm sorry. Please tell Mister Clamp that the answer is no.
FORSTER: Keep the TV. As Mr. Wing walks Clamp's men to the door in b.g., HOLD on the TV set and a small, furry PAW that reaches into FRAME to change the TV CHANNEL. With the change of stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE from a Rambo picture. SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie

KATE: The Clamp Centre is the most advanced "smart building" in America, with the latest, in security, communications, and climate control. If you'll follow me over here. Still talking, she takes them toward a STAIRCASE.
MARGE: .some people have written in to say that, if they're serving these dishes in a dark room, maybe for those romantic occasions, they notice a glow coming from some of the meat courses. Now, that's perfectly normal. REVEAL that this image is on a control-room monitor at the Clamp Cable studios. Billy, carrying a shopping bag, passes the control roomand turns down a narrow hallway.
GRANDPA FRED: .tonight's movie is so scary the people who saw it when it came out in the theaters twelve years ago are just learning how to speak simple phrases and eat solid food again! That's right'. Talk about scary' It's a good thing your Grandpa Fred is here with you He waits for something he expected to hear, but it doesn't happen. He breaks character.
GRANDPA FA: The moan. There's posed to be a moan, from t ck, and I say, "Oh, Renfield, y a o u want some more flies, don't you," and I go back there and open the door
BILLY: Hi, Fred. Hey, I was sorry to hear about your new time slot. I think they're making a big GRANDPA FRED A mistake? Kid. it's a disaster. People that watch TV at three-thirty in the morning are not scared of the Wolfman. The only thing that scares those people is getting sober and finding work.

BILLY: Yeah. That's so they can put people close together and they won't overhear each other. You're not supposed to notice it.
GRANDPA FRED: Sure. But if you listen to it there are little voices in there.

FORSTER: Let me hear the voices. The technician brings up VOICES on a speaker. They sound like voice-overs on slick TV commercials.
ANNOUNCERS' VOICES: ( dynamic many
FORSTER: That's fine
A TECHNICIAN: to Forster ) It's for you, sir. Forster turns to see a technician pointing at a MONITOR showing CLAMP'S FACE. Forster greets the screen.
FORSTER: Yes, Mister Clamp.
FORSTER: That's terrific, sir.
FORSTER: Yes sir. Tall!
FORSTER: But a Camp LOGO ;ills the monitor screen, and Clamp's face disappe rs behipo- it. Forster turns and looks over a technician's shoulder at a MONITOR. A spy CAMERA shows a stressed-out EMPLOYEE lighting a cigarette in a STOREROOM.

MESSENGER: Huh. This is for Doctor Catheter.
PEGGY: I can sign for it.
MESSENGER: Okay. This copy's yours. Thanks. Whistling Gizmo's tune again, the messenger leaves the office almost running into DR. CATHETER, Splice-o-Life's chief scientist, who's on his way in.
PEGGY: Doctor Catheter, this just came for you.

LEWIS: Hi, Doctor.
DR. CATHETER: How's that cloning work coming? Martin turns around. He is Lewis's IDENTICAL TWIN.
MARTIN: R R e l_ well, Doctor. The twins talk in rapid e nation, as if they share a brain. LEWIS t A Say, Doctor, look at
MARTIN: .I think you'll find it Following the SOUND of the crooning that caught the messenger's attention, they take Catheter over to a lab table where the LIGHTS ARE LOWERED above a covered cage. Martin pulls back the cloth to reveal GIZMO, who stops singing and looks up at them.
LEWIS: Some sort of rodent, apparently.
MARTIN: .and it can't take bright light.
LEWIS: Watch this, Doctor. He opens the side door of Gizmo's cage and turns on a TAPE PLAYER. Hearing the bouncy ROCK MUSIC, Gizmo playfully DANCES out of the cage as the scientists talk.
DR. CATHETER: Hmp! Qu-te, isn't he?
MARTIN: That may be genetic.
LEWIS: .we're not sure yet. But as he amuses his captors, Gizmo is slyly looking around for a way out of here. He edges farther away from the cage.
DR. CATHETER: Not so fast, pal. He abruptly switches the MUSIC off, and GRABS Gizmo just before the Mogwai can make good his escape. Dr. Catheter sticks the frightened Gizmo back in the cage, and shuts the side door DR. CATHETER ( CONT. ) What's wrong with you two? He almost made a break for it.
MARTIN: Sorry, sir
DR. CATHETER: How are you going to pro, with him? ( vim
LEWIS 113: Cell samples tomorr
MARTIN: .tissue culture hursday.
DR. CATHETER: And then there's body structure. And for that, my little friend. The three scientists LOOM over the terrified Gizmo. Dr. Catheter reaches into the cage to give Gizmo a POKE.
BILLY: The WORKER in the next cubicle speaks up.
CUBICLE NEIGHBOR: Jump around.
BILLY: CUBICLE NEIGHBOR You sat still for too long. The building thinks you left. It's saving energy. Jump around. Billy jumps around, and the LIGHTS come back on, as the messenger who visited the genetics lab comes to the Cubicle Neighbor's desk with a package.

MARTIN: This is the most interesting bio- electrical work I've ever been involved in. Here you go, boy. He FEEDS the rat some liquid from a VIAL with a LIGHTNING-BOLT insignia on its label.

F: Billy, whistling, lifts the cTiver on the wrong cage. He drops it in shock as he gets a GLIMPSE of a growth-hormone experiment: a hairy SPIDEbout twelve inches across. Then, as Gizmo's singin news, Billy's eyes fall on the right covered cage and theeaming SCALPELS arranged next to it. Billy heads back to the copying machine. On the way, he flips the latch on the monkeys' cage and is back at the copier in time to look up, "surprised," as the excited monkeys scamper past his into the center of the lab, distracting the scientists
LEWIS: Theodore! What are you doing out?
MARTIN: Alvin! Put down that DNA! As the scientists chase the monkeys, Billy hurries to Gizmo's cage. He opens the cage, and HIS EYES MEET GIZMO'S it's hard to say which of then is more excited. But the gala reunion will have to wait. Billy scoops Gizmo into his toolbox. He walks out of the lab, leaving the copier a mess.
E: INT. BATHROOM 32 32 Billy goes through a small anteroom and a second door, into the bathroom, where he leans against the door, catching his breath. He starts to lift the cover on the cage, then remembers to turn the LIGHTS down. He lifts the cover A boy and his Mogwai! EMOTIONS flood over their faces recognition, relief, shared secrets and memories. Billy props the cage on a sink, takes Gizmo out.
BILLY: Hey, guy.did you miss me? Gizmo does EYE MOVEMENTS shyly hedging, then admitting it.
GIZMO: ( Twitterpg of strong agreement. )
R: Billy sets about furiously washing his hands, just as Forster comes into the bathroom. Billy doesn't see him standing there, until he shakes water off his hands
FORSTER: You're wetting my shoes, Peltzer. Billy sees Forster, sees the shoes, grabs a paper towel and is about to drop to his knees.
BILLY: I'm sorry, sir let me
FORSTER: Stand up, Peltzer. Come with me. Billy grabs the tool box and follows Forster out the door. As they go into the anteroom, Forster's clipboard-carrying

BILLY: It means "men's bathroom."
FORSTER: What is the man holding?

CLAMP: That's okay. Everybody just relax, and go back to what you'd be doing normally. I know I haven't been down here before, but that's going to change. I'm going to be a little more "hands-on" with these operations from now on. As he speaks, Clamp glances over Billy's shoulder, and spots the Chinatown drawing.
BILLY: You've captured the whole essence of the project here. Look at the kids with the kites. That's warmth. I like warmth. What's your name?
CLAMP: You've captured the whole essence of the project here. Look at the kids with the kites. That's warmth. I like warmth. What's your name?

BILLY: Oh, it's, uh it's automatic. It opens up now and then, in case you need anything.
CLAMP: Huh. I didn't know about that one. He moves on, nodding vaguely at Marla who goes over to Billy, looking at him through completely new eyes.
MARLA: Did you hear that? "People who produce. I've been working here six years, and I've never even seen him in person.

BILLY: Sounds terrific.
MARLA: Let me just grab my coat, and I'll be right back. As Marla goes O.S., Billy slips Gizmo's drawer open and talks into it.

MARLA: ( CONTINUED )
BILLY: He grabs his sportcoat, and follows Maria toward the elevators. As they go, CAMERA HOLDS on Gizmo's drawer. It slowly shakes i open, and the curious Mogwai's eyes and ears come into view, i checking out the world of Billy's office. Gizmo ducks back out of sight .but, a moment later, a CHAIN OF LARGE PAPER CLIPS is tossed down from the drawer, making a ladder to the floor. As Gizmo starts hoisting himself over the edge of the drawer,
BILLY: Uh could you excuse me a second? I'll be right back.

Lenny is big, dumb, and loyal, while George is small, with a criminal caginess he gets Lenny to do everything for him. Gizmo watches the wastebasket where the third furball landed start to ROCK back and forth but is distracted as the BOUNCING FURBALL hits the floor in front of him, then ricochets up onto a DESKTOP. To SOUND FX of a bowling ball hitting the pins, the furball rolls into a desk corner, and the third Mogwai unfolds upside-down. This is DAFFY, a dizzy, uncontrollably antic Mogwai with the demented juvenile Joie de vivre we associate with the great Daffy Duck.

While Daffy, up on the desktop, starts playing with everything in sight. .Mohawk, on the floor, moves in on Gizmo.
GIZMO: George and Lenny drop down to the carpet to join Mohawk, as Gizmo standing now backs away. There's a grated VENT opening low on the wall behind him. Lenny grabs Gizmo with a fast-moving paw, and Mohawk, moving in close, SPITS in Gizmo's eyes.
DAFFY: Wa-hogs !

MARGE: This is how we used to cook for big groups, before we had our microwave ovens and the other modern appliances. It would take days to plan the menu, and hours over a hot stove to do the cooking. But now, we can make this same tuna-noodle cheez-product chowder surprise in just a few minutes, and you can feed anything from a high school reunion to a complete chain gang with this kind of quantity.
CAMERAMAN: Huh. Brownout or something. Marge HEARS a TAPPING noise from inside the soup pot. Confused, she lifts the lid and JUMPS BACK, as LENNY now a GREMLIN, but his dopey face still recognizable sits up in the soup pot, wearing a chef's hat, and SPLATTERS Marge with orange noodle-casserole GOO. He whips out a TURKEY EASTER, and SQUIRTS Marge with it.

As the tourists go, the Gremlins turn savagely toward the ovens. George whispers to Lenny, who nods obediently and throws several METAL UTENSILS into the microwaves. The Gremlins close the ovens and start them up. The ovens fill with furious ARCS of blue light
MARGE: Look out! and THE OVENS EXPLODE, showering the set with GLASS. As Marge and her cameraman escape the studio, the ovens catch FIRE. The flames lick up toward the ceiling and set off the SPRINKLERS. George and Lenny grin, standing tall to shower in the spray. As the water hits, BUBBLES appear on the Gremlins' backs. Close on the bubbles, CAMERA finds the tiny heads of GREMLIN OFFSPRING, getting ready to burst out. As the studio fills with the ominous SMOKE and COLORED LIGHT of Gremlin multiplication, Kate runs from the room.

CLAMP: You're not my secretary. The Gremlin responds by grabbing a SILEX POT of boiling-hot water from the nearby coffee station, and FLINGING the boiling water at Clamp who ducks it, as it SCALDS the paint on the wall behind him. Clamp makes a tentative move toward the Gremlin, who THROWS the empty Silex. It barely misses Clamp, and SMASHES against the The Gremlin JUMPS at Clamp, who tries to bat it away from his face, like a kid panicked by a moth but his flailing knocks the Gremlin back, so that its foot is caught in the hopper of the secretary's SHREDDER.
