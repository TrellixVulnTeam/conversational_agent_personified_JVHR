GHOST RIDER: Written by David S. Goyer
SOMETHING: The coyote reaches a steep ridge, looks out over a patchy Southwestern town.
LITTLE MIKE: where do you chink you're going, Blaze?
BLAZE: Sick, cutting out early.
LITTLE MIKE: The hell you are! Blaze jumps on his bike - a muscular, battered BSA.
BLAZE: Aaa n? You say that every time. Blaze kicks-starts the bike. It ROARS thunderously.
LITTLE MIKE: ( over the noise ) Well I mean it this time!
BLAZE: ( gunning the throttle ) See you tomorrow, Little Mike! The bike HOWLS, hauls up on its back wheel. Screams out the shop leaving Little Mike holding his ears. The other workers WHOOP and HOLLER, especially when Blaze snags a pair of BOLT- CUTTERS from a passing tool rack on the fly.
JED: ( SHOUTING )
MURPHY: ( tapping his watch ) Yeah, we're on a tight schedule!
BLAZE: So what are you waiting for? Blaze burns away, leaving the pickup for dust.
JED: Christ, Mickey was right on the money!
BLAZE: Car twenty-two!
MURPHY: ( LAUGHING )
BLAZE: Thank you gentlemen, that's it for today! Jed bangs on the cab roof. Coop waves. Jed and Murphy salute. The pickup peels away. Blaze retrieves his bike. Stands it back up, kicks it alive, guns the throttle and cold jumps straight out of the car. Seconds later he's powering away, ripping up a storm, chasing the pickup towards the horizon.
RITA: ( TO CHUCK )
CHUCK: So how're things going at the shop, John?
BLAZE: ( scarfing down his food ) Good, good.
CHUCK: ( not buying it ) Yeah? Cause Mike says you've been slacking off, horsing around.
ROXANNE: ( annoyed, protective )
DALD __: ( ALL SMILES )
BLAZE: ( ALL SMILES )
CHUCK: You were saying?
BLAZE: ( distracted, looking to the
DOOR ): Right, so anyway
JOHN: Blaze looks over. Two Sheriff's Deputies, LUCAS COLE and RICK GEORGE, are standing in the doorway. Roxanne looks pissed like this isn't the first time this has happened. Blaze stands, approaches. Clearly, he knows them both.
BLAZE: ( cocky, wary ) Lucas. Rick.
COLE: Johnny. We'd like you to come down the Their demeanor is hard. Won't take "no" for an answer.
BLAZE: ( INSOLENT )
ROXANNE: ( TERSE )
BLAZE: She's sound asleep. He crouches, touches her face.
ROXANNE: ( SLURRED )
BLAZE: No. No. Everything's okay. Jed and Murph just got a little boisterous at The Prairie Dog last night. Cops wanted to read us the riot act, that's all She yawns, curls up, starts to drift away again.
ROXANNE: I was worried about you. And I don't like your friends. But Blaze won't let her go back to sleep. He jostles her.
BLAZE: Listen, I want to show you something
ROXANNE: I'm sure you do. But I'm half-asleep and you're an ass-hole.
BLAZE: I'm serious, Rox. This is important. He drags her up off the couch. Makes her stand up. She MOANS, scowls, but he gets her on her feet.
ROXANNE: John, I have to go to work tomorrow
BLAZE: ( offers her coat ) Put your coat on. You'll be glad you did. Promise. It'll be an adventure. A mystery tour.
ROXANNE: This better be good. She stomps to the bathroom. Blaze chuckles inwardly. Steals a fortune cookie from the left-overs, snaps it open The fortune is blank. Both sides. He tosses it away.
COYOTE EYES: glittering black, watching.
BLAZE: Keep going. It's just up there.
ROXANNE: I'm not riding one of those stupid You don't have to ride, just climb up. She steps up onto the wooden platform, smiles back at him.
BLAZE: You don't have to ride, just climb up. She steps up onto the wooden platform, smiles back at him.
ROXANNE: You're going to have to grow up one day, Johnny Blaze.
BLAZE: Not if I can help it. He follows her up onto the ride. She weaves through the wooden animals. Starting to enjoy this secret adventure.
ROXANNE: ( TURNING BACK )
BLAZE: Ever hear of a carnival wedding? Roxanne shakes her head. Blaze is fiddling with a crisp, new dollar bill, folding it, making something.
ROXANNE: You made that up.
BLAZE: Swear to God. He finishes folding the bill. The "one" is now neatly set on top of an ORIGAMI WEDDING BAND like a paper jewel.
ROXANNE: It's beautiful. He smiles at her joy, wrestles with what he's about to say.
BLAZE: How'd I ever find you?
ROXANNE: ( SHRUGGING )
BLAZE: I don't believe in fate.
ROXANNE: Maybe it believes in you. They hug each other fiercely. A long, soulful embrace. Blaze looks to the city lights beneath them once more.
BLAZE: I know. I'm gonna get my shit together. For Leal, this time,
ROXANNE: Don't promise me, promise her.
THE COYOTE: blinks. THUNDER from the next scene prelaps as we
BLAZE: We gotta go. Get your stuff together.
ROXANNE: What happened? What's wrong? Roxanne follows Blaze into the bedroom.
BLAZE: I fucked up. The police are coming. Grab your things. We have to go. She sags, clearly been through this before. He tosses a suitcase onto the bed, looks back at her.
FOLLOWING BLAZE: as he storms into the bathroom. Reaches behind the high cistern, retrieves a hidden HANDGUN. He jumps down. Tears the side panel off the old bath tub. There's a stack of FLAT BLACK BOXES hidden within. Blaze drags them out, drops one - It pops open, spilling UNCUT DIAMONDS all over the floor. Blaze CURSES, struggles to gather up the loot.
ON ROXANNE: standing in the doorway. She sawit all.
BLAZE: BLAZE'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR POV: The cop car is turning, heading back in their direction.
ROXANNE: Blaze floors the gas. The speedometer leaps.
JOHN: Blaze floors the gas. The speedometer leaps.
ROXANNE: Slow down, John
SLOW DOWN!: LIGHTNING flashes, and suddenly, there's a
COYOTE: or, the road, right in their path.
BLAZE: Roxanne ? belt hanging beside him the passenger seat mr )ty.
BLAZE: ( terror seizing him )
ROXANNE!!!: ON ROXANNE
ON ROXANNE: lying ten yards away, unconscious, maybe dead. Blaze scrambles to her, rolls her over. He hauls her into his arms, SOBBING, the two of them covered in mud and glass and God knows what.
TROOPERS: are coming down the incline, guns drawn, FLASHLIGHTS beaming. They descend on Blaze, crying to pull him free of Roxanne.
BLAZE: Get your fucking hands off me! Lucas Cole, the deputy who questioned Blaze earlier, approaches. Blaze SEES him and calms down a little.
THEIR POV: Roxanne lays in a surgery bay, DOCTORS and NURSES milling around her.
BLAZE: Is she going to make it?
DOCTOR: ( blinks, stutters ) Mr. Blaze, I
BLAZE: )_a ch= going r4 make i r?
DOCTOR: We don't know. She's critical. Her injuries are grave. There's a real chance she won't
BLAZE: What about the baby? The doctor hesitates, glances at Cole.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry. We did everything we Blaze's will shatters as the full realization of what he's done slams into him. Tears sting his cheeks. Cole gives him space. Whatever punishment awaits Blaze can't be any worse than the hell he's living through now.
BOOTS: walk purposefully on linoleum. Passing bay after bay. Beyond the Troopers, SOMEONE is approaching, half seen through layers of glass. Blaze HEARS the footsteps, lifts his weary head. The shadow keeps coming, half-glimpsed between partitions as it draws near.
STARKE: You look like you could use some help. Blaze glances at the troopers. They're still completely unaware of Starke's presence. It's as if Starke and Blaze have somehow stepped a split-second sideways in time. The lights around them continue to dim. The second hand on the wall clock stops. An eerie, dreamlike moment the wind, the rain, the tree branches tapping against the window pane.
BLAZE: ( LOST )
STARKE: If I could help her, would you be willing co make a deal?
BLAZE: What kind of deal?
STARKE: She lives. You work for me. Something about Starke's eyes. Commanding and haunting at the same time.
BLAZE: What kind of work? Starke just keeps smiling. Lays a comforting hand on Blaze's shoulder as we drift towards Roxanne's beeping EEG.
CLERK: Just passing through? Nomi nods, uneasy. She glances over her shoulder, searches
NOMI: ( DISTRACTED )
CLERK: Where are you headed? Late night, storm like this
NOMI: What do you care?
CLERK: ( shrugging, defensive ) Just asking. He keeps packing. But he knows she's trouble.
NOMI: It's too much, baby. Put it back. I don't have enough money for that. Rain stares right at Nomi and brazenly slips the doll into her coat pocket. Nomi glances at the Clerk. He didn't notice.
TO: LANDSDALE ( 40s ), a stone-faced criminal, who motions to five other thugs lounging nearby FUSCO, ALBRIGHT, CHUDACOFF, LLOYD and ODELL.
WEATHERMAN: scattered thunderstorms firing along a stalled frontal boundary. Damaging winds, hail, and isolated tornadoes will be possible across the Dakotas and Upper
MIDWEST: Blaze unfolds a tattered map and studies it. The map is crisscrossed with red lines tracing storms from city to city, along with all sorts of arcane, personal notations. Blaze traces his finger down to his present location: DEADFALL.
NOMI: Rain dutifully fastens herself in.
NOMI: Stay here. And lock the doors. Nomi climbs out into the rain, SLAMS the door. Rain works the locks, but the driver's side is all bent up and twisted
NOMI: Back the fuck off! LANDSDALE comes from left of nowhere, twists the gun from her hands in one unexpected move. She spins, SEES Carrigan approaching and recognizes him instantly.
CARRIGAN: Well, if it isn't Little Miss Running He grabs her by her hair, shoves the Glock beneath her chin.
NOMI: Fuck you, Billy
CARRIGAN: Now I might just take you up on that, Nome. Old Billy-Ray's been getting a little tired shaking hands with the governor, know what I'm saying?
LANDSDALE: Careful with her! Rain is dragged kicking and screaming from the cab.
ON NOMI,: struggling to free herself, desperate to help her child.
NOMI: Leave her alone! Rain fights like a hellion, rakes her fingernails across Odell's face.
ODELL: SLAP! Landsdale back-hands the little girl. As she reels, he binds her hands with duct tape, then picks her up and throws into the Bronco.
NOMI: YOU COCKSUCKERS! INT. LAKOTA MOTEL - DUSK The coin slows. Blaze opens his eyes, a look of dread washing over his face. He stares at his hands they're shaking, emitting a HEAT HAZE.
YOU COCKSUCKERS!: INT. LAKOTA MOTEL - DUSK The coin slows. Blaze opens his eyes, a look of dread washing over his face. He stares at his hands they're shaking, emitting a HEAT HAZE.
CARRI GAN: Tell you what, Hon. You want your goddamned divorce so much? He aims the Glock at her face, about to pull the trigger as
ODELL: The hell was that? The men glance at each other, nervous. A THUNDER-QUAKE rumbles, so low and gritty it'll rattle your fillings. The men look around, frightened. Rocks fall from the surrounding butte. Odell looks down. The SOUND is deafening, vibra tine: the very earth. And that's when it happens:
HEAD: THE FACE OF JOHN BLAZE Skeletal, aflame, but somehow still Johnny, his tortured visage recognizable even as the furnace blazes blue-white. His jaw bone pivots open to unleash an INHUMAN HOWL, at once predatory and tormented, a shriek of eternal damnation. Time speeds up again. The men run. The Ghost Rider accelerates from zero to sixty in a heartbeat. Lloyd runs fast as he can. Talk about pointless. The Ghost Rider seizes his head, drags him seventy yards, burning him black, discarding him The other men let rip. Guns blaze. BULLETS punch through the Ghost Rider, coming out his back as red hot slag. The demon hauls a deep curve, powers up onto his rear wheel
ALBRIGHT: What the fuck?! WHAT THE FUCK?! Albright FIRES his shotgun. THUNDERING past like an Amtrak train, the Ghost Rider PUNCHES a flaming fist right through Albright'-, face. That's it for the others. They scramble for the trucks. WHOOSH! The Ghost Rider lashes out with his chains, lassos Chudacoff. He SCREAMS as the metal sears his body, falls heavily, burning The Ghost Rider skids to a halt, summons something internal and lets it loose a blast of PURE HELLFIRE that courses down the chains and engulfs Chudacoff, immolating him. The men make the trucks, pile in. Landsdale slams the Tundra into drive. The big truck hauls away. Carrigan fights to get the Bronco into gear. Rain peeks out from the back, eyes bugging
RAIN'S POV: as the Ghost Rider dismounts, stalks through the rain towards them. He raising his skeletal hand, clenches it, and suddenly we are
BACK OUTSIDE: with Carrigan. His truck won't start. Somehow, the ?host Rider has actin uished the flames within his engine. The Ghost Rider keeps coming, his skeletal claws/fingers white-hot now, throbbing with heat. He slices through the Bronco's door like a human oxy-acetylene torch, chopping the vehicle apart. Carrigan panics, drags Rain out the passenger door. But Fusco is still trapped inside. Can't get his seatbelt off. The Ghost Rider tears open the roof, bisects the vehicle and HURLS the front away, leaving Fusco cowering in the melted back seat. The Ghost Rider looms over Fusco, extending a skeletal claw
FUSCO: Oh God, please, I ain't nothing to do with nothin'. I ain't nothin'. Please,
PLEASE!: ON CARRIGAN
ON CARRIGAN: tugging Rain away from the horror, trying to ignore Fusco's terrible SCREAMS. He looks back, wishes he hadn't the man to look right into
FUSCO: shudders, eyes bulging. All he can do is stare into those awful pits, fall into them, as grisly IMAGES from his evil past spark and shred into his melting mind. Every act of violence, every crime he ever committed beatings, murders, acts of torture and revenge are now revisited upon Fusco tenfold. This is the PENANCE STARE, and Fusco is feeling it's full, hellish force. The Ghost Rider and Fusco SCREAM in sync. Carrigan and Rain can't look away. They stand transfixed Then it's over. The Ghost Rider drops Fusco into the mud. He lies there, shuddering, glassy-eyed, burned black but still alive, his brain irrevocably overloaded. And The Ghost Rider is somehow different too. Immobile. Internal. Then he looks up, past Carrigan. R;rht at. Rain. Rain stares back. But it's
BLAZE'S FACE: she SEES. An abject abyss of pain and shame and torment. And Rain's terror is forgotten for just that moment, replaced with something best described as empathy.
CARRIGAN: Did you kill it ?
LANDS DALE: Fuck if I know!!! Just then, Nomi's pickup backs into view. Odell is driving. Ca___gan snatches Rain up like baggage, starts forward.
ON NOMI: dazed, in a muddy gully. She scrambles up to the lip, SEES the burning Tundra nearby, SEES her pickup hauling away into the night. She WAILS, tries to drags herself to her feet CREAK. The burning wreckage moves. Moves again. Nomi ducks down, watches, uncomprehending. The crumpled truck is hurled aside. Two tons. Tipped over like a packing crate. Nomi slips down into the gully, gasping with fear. HEAVY FOOTSTEPS and CRACKLING FIRE draw near Nomi dares to look up. The Ghost Rider stares down at her. Like Death itself. Imagine yourself face to face with a Great White, an unfathomable, impenetrable force of nature Then imagine that force turning away, sparing you. The world exhales. After a moment Nomi dares to look again:
ON BLAZE,: stumbling through the crowded ward, head down, in obvious pain. OR. QUINLAN ( 30s, harried ), struggles to keep up, filling out paperwork on the fly.
QUINLAN: Sir, you have to tell me your name.
BLAZE: I just need to sit down for a moment. And I need some forceps, gauze, tape
QUINLAN: I'll decide what you need, alright? Blaze hauls a curtain aside, finds an empty surgery bay, prepped and ready to go.
BLAZE: No, no. Do I look like troub-unghhh He grimaces as the jacket comes off. Bullet wounds, shotgun damage, torn flesh, and a lot of BLOOD.
QUINLAN: ( TAKEN ABACK )
BLAZE: Motorcycle accident. Couple abrasions, maybe some rib fractures ( Quinlan tries to help ) Just step back, I'll handle it
QUINLAN: Those are bullet holes. Blaze cleans the wounds she's referring to, grits his teeth as he swabs gauze deep into his flesh.
BLAZE: Nah. They're just gouges. Surface damage. They'll heal up fine. Ungh - do you have any painkillers?
QUINLAN: ( assertive now, plainly
SUSPICIOUS ): This was no motorcycle accident. Somebody has cauterized your wounds Blaze inserts the forceps into a particularly nasty wound.
BLAZE: Percocet? Vicodin, maybe?
QUINLAN: I'm sorry but I need to report this. Stay right there. Quinlan backs out through the curtain. Blaze sighs, tapes a thick gauze patch over the wound, eyes hunting. He SEES a drug cabinet, breaks into it. Fills his pockets.
ON BLAZE,: backing into a quiet corner. He suppresses a sob, fumbling a hypodermic as he fills it with stolen morphine. He jabs the spike into his leg, sags as the drug takes effect. After a moment, Blaze calms, gets his bearings, notices that he's leaning against a bulletin board on which is pinned
NOMI: sitting on a nearby bed. Beaten, bruised, desolate. A PAIR OF STATE TROOPERS are questioning her. She stares past them, straight at Blaze. She recognizes him.
NOMI: You were there last night.
BLAZE: Excuse me?
NOMI: when they took my daughter.
BLAZE: I don't know what you're talking about
NOMI: Yes you do. Blaze tries to pass off his unease with an ill-conjured smile. He pushes past her, moving to his battered motorcycle. Nomi follows.
BLAZE: Lady, you don't know shit. ( his tone turning lethal ) Now bark the fuck o t of my Ii Blaze mounts his bike, kicks it alive, leaves Nomi in the EXT. HIGH PLAINS - DAY Blaze heads north under a big sky castled with towering white ( CAN'::VL=D1 Prairie grasslands roll away on either side of the two lane blacktop. But Blaze's landscape is deep within and dark, dominated by the thunderheads of last night's horror. He notches the throttle up a little, cruises at ninety. Rolls his head back, lets the wind stream over his face. Then he hears ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE. Blaze looks back
NOMI: pulls alongside Blaze, riding a monster bike of her own. Blaze burns away. But Nomi's no slouch. She matches his speed and is back beside him moments later. She SHOUTS:
NOMI: PULL OVER! I NEED TO TALK TO YOU! Blaze guns the bike again, jinks around an oncoming station wagon that blares it's HORN_ But Nomi's still on him
BLAZE: ( IRRITATED )
NOMI: I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE GHOST RIDER!!! Angry with himself, Blaze throttles his bike to the max, howling over the next rise on his back wheel, probably hitting one-fifteen as he vanishes from view. Nomi skids to a stop on the shoulder and waits, her engine RUMBLING. Wind blows. Lizards click. After a long beat, Blaze reappears. Stops far away on the crest of the rise. Stares at her.
NOMI: I knew what you were the moment I saw you. I can help you jf you're willing to help mp-. I know things.
BLAZE: Like what?
NOMI: This thing that's riding you, the Ghost Rider. I guess it has a lot of names. But the one I grew up hearing was nagi ocanl sice. It means the Spirit of You actually believe what you're telling You kidding? I'm pure-bred Dakota. I can hear the mountains talking to each other. And I saw you light up those pricks like Chinese New Year last night. They reach the trailer. Nomi fixes glaze with a stare.
BLAZE: You actually believe what you're telling You kidding? I'm pure-bred Dakota. I can hear the mountains talking to each other. And I saw you light up those pricks like Chinese New Year last night. They reach the trailer. Nomi fixes glaze with a stare.
NOMI: You kidding? I'm pure-bred Dakota. I can hear the mountains talking to each other. And I saw you light up those pricks like Chinese New Year last night. They reach the trailer. Nomi fixes glaze with a stare.
BLAZE: ( ANGRY )
BLAZE: ( aside, to Nomi ) Does your grandfather understand English?
NOMI: He understands. He just refuses to speak Laforte continues to ramble intermittently. Blaze shifts, impatient, finally sits forward.
BLAZE: Listen, I don't want to be an ass-hole, but can we just fast-forward the whole Yoda routine? The home team scores! Laforte WHOOPS wildly, loses his mask, COUGHS uncontrollably. Blaze stands. He's out of there.
LAFORTE: ( rasping, in English ) Give me the coin. Blaze stops, cocks an eyebrow at Nomi. She shrugs. Blaze hands over the coin. Laforte studies it, starts speaking in Dakota again. Nomi translates:
NOMI: The man you're looking for goes by lots of names. Coyote, Black Dog. In Dakota, he's Waka Sica. The Trickster. Look at him straight on, you might see a human. Look at him out of the corner of your eye at one of the in-between times dusk or dawn, you might see something else.
BLAZE: What does he want?
LAFORTE: Wacokico. Vengeance.
BLAZE: Because it's his nature. Laforte elaborates. Nomi continues to translate.
NOMI: Because it's his nature. Laforte elaborates. Nomi continues to translate.
BLAZE: I've been looking for this man for five years now, storm-chasing ( pulls out his map ) Tracked him halfway across the country. How do I make him lift the curse?
LAFORTE: Ta ocanzeke kin akta a'ikoyake. T'e sniya kel rrrani. Takuni a'ikoyake sni ya'un kte hantana, wocanzeke kin ekignaka My grandfather says you've been looking in the wrong place. You need to look inward. The Ghost Rider is Starke's weapon. An extension of his rage. But it can't ride people unless it has something to latch onto in the first place. You understand? Blaze nods. He thinks he does. Laforte hands the coin back, returns his attention to the game. But as Blaze starts to rise, Laforte says one final thing:
NOMI: My grandfather says you've been looking in the wrong place. You need to look inward. The Ghost Rider is Starke's weapon. An extension of his rage. But it can't ride people unless it has something to latch onto in the first place. You understand? Blaze nods. He thinks he does. Laforte hands the coin back, returns his attention to the game. But as Blaze starts to rise, Laforte says one final thing:
LAFORTE: Wee-cha-sha nee-shee-cha hay? Nomi pauses, deciding how to phrase what the old man said.
BLAZE: What? What'd he say?
NOMI: He wants to know if you're a bad man. If the Ghost Rider turned its penance stare on you, would you burn?
BLAZE: Why don't you just go to the police?
NOMI: I did. But I'm red. They said they'll "look into it". Truth is, I've had a few run-ins with them myself.
BLAZE: Your daughter why does Starke want her? Nomi takes a beat, looks away. Haunted, ashamed.
NOMI: Because he's her father. And he wants her back. Billy-Ray and the others, they're being paid to take her to him. Blaze nods. Things are falling into place now.
BLAZE: Just so you understand what you're asking, this thing inside me I can't control it. It just comes out. And when it does, it's like I'm a prisoner in my own body. There's no reasoning with it. It doesn't have a conscience. It doesn't even have a personality. It's just a
NOMI: You're looking for Starke. I'm looking for my kid. We find one, we'll find the And then ?
BLAZE: And then ?
NOMI: ( POINTEDLY )
MAN: Is she comfortable? Are you feeding her She's alright, I guess. Quiet.
VOICE: ( FILTERED )
MAN: Does she know where you're taking her?
VOICE: I think she's figured it out.
MAN: And how does she feel about that?
VOICE: How the hell should I know?
CARRIGAN: I'm not a psychologist. She's a fucking freak, alright? Always has been. Sooner I get her out of my sight, the better.
THE COYOTE: approaches the phone booth situated beside the rental office. Inside the booth, the man is half-seen.
MAN: She's the most important thing in your life, Carrigan. Make sure she arrives And be careful. She'll kill if she gets the chance. him. Once again, we meet
AMBROSE STARKE: Same sky-blue eyes flecked with metal. Starke and Coyote stare at each other, indifferent to the storm raging around them- He starts towards the rental office.
WEATHERMAN: experiencing extraordinary conditions. Tornadoes blanketing much of East Texas, with reports of extensive damage and gusts of up to seventy miles per hour As Pecrowsky turns off the TV, we hear the door CHIME. Starke enters, bringing a strong gust of wind with him.
PETROWSKY: Sorry, guy, I'm just closing up. Starke looks to a clock on the wall it's 4:55.
STARKE: According to the hours posted outside, you're still open.
PETROWSKY: ( EXASPERATED )
STARKE: I would like to rent a car "Jim" . Something in Starke's tone gives Petrowsky pause. He glances to the window and the growing storm beyond. We SEE the coyote out there, watching from across the way.
PETROWSKY: ( RELENTING )
STARKE: Starke. First name, Ambrose.
PETROWSKY: ( typing in the name ) Starke, okay. What kind of car were you looking for? Starke picks up a laminated placard featuring various cars.
STARKE: What about the Cadillac Deville? I noticed you had one in your lot outside.
PETROWSKY: Sorry, already spoken for. How `bout a full-size car? I can give you a Chevy Malibu, Ford Taurus Starke deliberates. Outside, the storm seems to grow stronger. Petrowsky shifts in his seat, trying to mask his impatience. Were he observant enough, he might also notice that the wall clock has stopped.
STARKE: I had my heart set on the Cadillac, Jim.
PETROWSKY: ( ANNOYED NOW )
STARKE: The Taurus, then.
PETROWSKY: Great. Can I see a driver's license? Starke reaches into his jacket, handing over a license. Petrowsky types in the required information, trying to ignore the vague feeling of uneasiness settling over him.
STARKE: Two, three
PETROWSKY: Any other drivers?
STARKE: And you'll be paying by ?
PETROWSKY: And you'll be paying by ?
STARKE: I'll need a three hundred dollar deposit. Starke nods, removing a money clip from his jacket, deftly sliding out three crisp, brand-new hundred dollar bills.
PETROWSKY: I'll need a three hundred dollar deposit. Starke nods, removing a money clip from his jacket, deftly sliding out three crisp, brand-new hundred dollar bills.
STARKE: I'll do it myself.
PETROWSKY: Petrowsky enters the final data, hits "PRINT". As the rental agreement begins feeding out, we hear a HORN FiONK. Starke turns. A mini-van has pulled up outside. A MOUSY WOMAN sits behind the wheel. A BOY sits in the back seat. The coyote is still there, but it pays no attention to them.
STARKE: Mrs. Petrowsky?
PETROWSKY: Petrowsky slides the agreement to Starke, takes out a pen:
STARKE: The price you quoted was $37,99, the mid- size rate. But you've listed the daily rate here as $62.99.
PETROWSKY: I did? Starke turns the agreement around for Petrowsky to see.
STARKE: Were you trying to cheat me, Jim?
PETROWSKY: No, no, not at all
STARKE: Then I'd like a new contract specifying the appropriate rate. Petrowsky squirms, uncomfortable. For in that pregnant moment, without either participant uttering at word, the entire nature of the transaction seems to have changed.
PETROWSKY: Look, can't we just go with the contract we've got here? I'll make a note of it and knock a day's rental off the total when you return it. What do you say?
STARKE: I say the Devil's in the details.
PETROWSKY: ( gasping, in shock ) Jesus Jesus
HELEN: Jim?! Jim, what happened?! Petrowsky clutches at his wife's arm, trying to speak. A shard of glass has penetrated his larynx.
PETROWSKY: H-helen get aaway Petrowsky's eyes widen in horror. Helen follows his gaze
STARKE: strides towards them, his face a veil of unmerciful contempt. The dust storm has taken on Biblical proportions, whipping and roiling around him, becoming an extension of his fury. He snatches Helen up by the throat, snapping her neck with inhuman strength, flings her lifeless body to the ground then he brings his boot heel down on Petrowsky'shead. crushing it like an _aashell.
THE COYOTE: appears, creeping along a parallel aisle. It pauses, lowering its snout, peering at the boy from afar. The Boy freezes. FOOTSTEPS approaching. He squirms around for a better view
A HAND: slips under the body of the car.Butit's not a human hand. It's the hand of a beast blackandtwisted, taloned. With a sudden movement, the hand flipsthecar up, sending the enter vehicle spiraling into theair.The Boy lies there,
ODELL: Want some food, kid? Rain doesn't respond. Odell rustles the bag.
CARRIGAN: She's not gonna eat, Odell. Just shut up and get some sleep.
ODELL: I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see the face of that thing, Lloyd
BURNING: ( shaking his head ) Just put it out of your head.
CARRIGAN: Just put it out of your head.
ODELL: If I could put it out of my head, I wouldn't be awake now, would I? Landsdale stirs. Carrigan gestures at the barren landscape.
CARRIGAN: Look out there, what do you see?
LANDSDALE: That's right. Miles and miles of nothing. And there's a lot of weird shit running around in that nothing. How many people you know seen a UFO, huh? Ten? Twenty? Hell, it's on every goddamn paper at the supermarket. You believe that shit, the whole country's being overrun by those bug-eyed motherfuckers.
CARRIGAN: That's right. Miles and miles of nothing. And there's a lot of weird shit running around in that nothing. How many people you know seen a UFO, huh? Ten? Twenty? Hell, it's on every goddamn paper at the supermarket. You believe that shit, the whole country's being overrun by those bug-eyed motherfuckers.
LANDSDALE: ( nodding, eyes closed ) Probe you in the ass, they get the What's your point, Mr. Serling?
ODELL: What's your point, Mr. Serling?
CARRIGAN: My point is; everybody's seen somethina. Ghosts, aliens, Bigfoot, whatever
ODELL: This wasn't no freaking Bigfoot! You see what it did to Albright? Punched his head clean off!
CARRIGAN: Look, I don't know what that thing was. All I know is, Starke's paying us a butt- load of money to deliver the kid to him. We were told we'd see things and we were told to look the other way. You want to cut out? I'll pull over right here.
LANDSDALE: Keep your shirt on, B. We didn't come this far just to limp home with nothing. Right, Odell? Odell settles back into his seat, uneasy.
ODELL: I guess. But I'd still like to know what that thing was.
RAIN: He's the Ghost Rider. Everybody looks at her. It's the first thing she's said.
CARRIGAN: ( CHUCKLING )
RAIN: It should. He's going to kill you all.
ODELL: ( FREAKING OUT )
NOMI: I don't like this. I spent the last six years trying to forget this place.
BLAZE: You got any idea where Billy-Ray might be Then we should start with where he's been.
NOMI: Then we should start with where he's been.
NO: Then we should start with where he's been.
BLAZE: Then we should start with where he's been.
BLAZE: Your husband used to work here?
NOMI: Billy-Ray dealt blackjack, poker. Worked the casino circuit. We met in Vegas. Things kind of went downhill after that.
NOMI: Believe me, Vince, this is the last place I want to be. But we need to find Billy- Ray. He took Rain.
RODENBURG: Sorry' The Deal Man hasn't been back in ( gesturing for them to leave ) You have a nice day now.
NOMI: But you must've talked to him. Do you know where he's headed? Just tell me What am I? His babysitter? I don't know where he is, Nome, and if I did, I sure as hell wouldn't be telling you. ( looking to the other guards ) Show these two ass-holes to the door.
RODENBURG: What am I? His babysitter? I don't know where he is, Nome, and if I did, I sure as hell wouldn't be telling you. ( looking to the other guards ) Show these two ass-holes to the door.
BLAZE: Look, this is important. We're talking about a kidnapping.
RODENBURG: ( sizing Blaze up ) We are? And who is ?
BLAZE: I'm just a friend.
RODENBURG: Ri h t. Nomi tell you what a blue ribbon slut she was? Do anything to support that needle habit of hers. Truth, 'bout the only person that hasn't had her around here is me. Blaze steps forward now, angry, threatening.
BLAZE: That's enough.
RO DENBURG: What, you gonna get all Steven Segal on me, tough guy? Pull a fucking Glimmer Blaze moves, twists Rodenburg's arm like rope, wrenches his thumb backwards, SLAMS Rodenburg face-first into one of those Plexiglas booths where people dive for dollars. The goons pull their pieces. Blaze just ups the pain.
BLAZE: I need you to understand something, Vince. I am, by nature, an inherently violent man and there's not much in the way of bad that I haven't already inflicted on this miserable world ( applying even more pressure ) So unless the idea of learning to drive a wheelchair with your mouth sounds appealing, I suggest you apologize to my friend and tell us WHERE THE FUCK BILLY-
RODENBURG: I don't know! I don't know Blaze gives Rodenburg's thumb a savage twist.
BLAZE: And I'm sorry I'm fucking sorry! Blaze releases him. As the goons close in, Blaze deftly relieving Goon #1 of his handgun and turns it back on him.
RODENBURG: And I'm sorry I'm fucking sorry! Blaze releases him. As the goons close in, Blaze deftly relieving Goon #1 of his handgun and turns it back on him.
BLAZE: Think about it. The goons relent. Blaze and Nomi exit, leaving Rodenburg slumped on the floor, cradling his mangled hand.
NOMI: Never thought I'd be back here. They pass cautiously through the front yard. Nomi's pickup is parked nearby. The front door bangs back and forth. Nomi pulls a revolver from her waist-band.
BLAZE: I think they're gone. Off Nomi's look, Blaze points at tire tracks in the dirt.
NOMI: Listen, those things Vince said
BLAZE: You don't have to explain yourself to me.
NOMI: Some of them are true.
BLAZE: Doesn't make you a bad person.
NOMI: You can see the past?
BLAZE: Just echoes, sometimes.
NOMI: I was dying. I'd shot myself full of Billy's best gear. Figured I'd teach him a lesson and go out in style.
STARKE: stands above her. There are OTHER SHADOWS drifting in behind him. Things better left half-glimpsed. Coyotes. Beasts.
BLAZE'S VOICE: "You look like
BLAZE: you could use some help." Nomi nods, hugs herself.
NOMI: And I took it. What else was I going to do? I don't know what happened after that. I'm not sure I ever want to ( beat, struggling ) All I know is, nine months later, Rain was born.
FLASHBACK IMAGES: Silent, disjointed. The moth. Nomi's face, terror-stricken. Starke, eyes alight with malice and mischief.
FLASHBACK IMAGES: Nomi striking back at Billy-Ray with a broken bottle. Setting the house ablaze.
BLAZE: Why send Billy-Ray after you?
NOMI: Sick irony, I guess. Billy certainly knew all my haunts ( shaking her head ) This was a mistake, Blaze. We're not going to find anything here. Blaze glances down a HEAT HAZE has engulfed his hand. He clenches his fist, looks up
BLAZE: Guess again. as HEADLIGHTS shine through one of the windows. Somebody's driving up to the house.
NOMI: ( WHISPERING )
BLAZE: ( FATALISTIC )
NOMI: What're you ?
RODENBURG: Talked-to Billy-Ray, chief. Don't know who you a r - e, but you picked the wrong Blaze struggles to contain the Ghost Rider, but his whole body is drenched in sweat now like he's going to spontaneously combust at any moment.
BLAZE: Please. Just tell us where they went and leave. There's no reason why you have to Rodenburg LAUGHS, looks at his friends in disbelief.
RODENBURG: I'm gonna die? Me? Buddy, you got your head screwed on bass-ackwards! Rodenburg FIRES into Blaze's chest once, twice. Blaze stumbles back against the porch. As he falls, Rodenburg mounts the steps, charging in after Nomi.
RODENBURG: Had to come back here, didn't you, Nomi? Just couldn't leave well enough alone. Nomi struggles to sit up. Rodenburg LAUGHS viciously, forces her back, drags at her jeans.
BLAZE: sits up. He looks to Doyle, TEARS OF FIRE streaming from his eyes. As he stands, his chest wounds ignites, the flames instantly cauterizing the flesh. He's suddenly engulfed in a heat haze. Wood smolders all around him. Doyle backs away, terrified. He FIRES his gun again and again, but the bullets just punch through Blaze, creating more flaming holes-
DOYLE: I'm sorry. soul, the fire expanding, engulfing Doyle.
BLAZE: I'm sorry. soul, the fire expanding, engulfing Doyle.
RODENBURG: Smoke and CRACKLING NOISES are building rapidly. The SHRIEKS persist, and those burning leaves are everywhere. Then - movement in the living room! Rodenburg draws a bead but it's Weingrod, pushing through the plastic sheeting, fearful, eyes darting. He speaks in a strained whisper.
WEINGROD: What's going on, man? Where's Oswalt? GUNFIRE! Outside! CRASH! Something hits the house. Then more SCREAMS, more GUNFIRE, and a RUMBLE so deep it's deadly. Pennebaker panics, pushing past Rodenburg.
PENNEBAKER: I want out of here, I'm getting out!
RODENBURG: Keep your fucking voices down!
WEINGROD: He's burning the house, man! He's
BURNING THE: RED-HOT CHAINS whip viciously around Weingrod's head and torso. Then he's wrenched backwards, hauled straight through the plastic sheeting
GHOST BLAZE: Half man, half monster, his pitiless skull-face hazing and flickering between human and inhuman states.
GHOST BLAZE: Where are they taking the girl? Rodenburg whimpers. Ghost Blaze grabs Rodenburg's hair, wrenches his head back.
RODENBURG: ( BEYOND TERRIFIED )
GHOST BLAZE: I don't know exactly, Jesus, I don't know!
RODENBURG: I don't know exactly, Jesus, I don't know!
ON BLAZE: He SEES the corpses, the burning vehicles, tries to deny the horror. But it's always the same another swath of destruction left in his wake, another righteous atrocity.
NOMI: He told you everything he knew. She's ten yards away, shaking. Not going to come any closer.
BLAZE: You asked for my help. I warned you what you were getting into. More a statement than an excuse. There are POLICE SIRENS on the wind. Blaze starts walking towards the pickup.
NOMI: I don't I don't know what else to do for you
BLAZE: S'okay just need to rest now
NOMI: I thought you were dead.
BLAZE: ( considering his wounds ) I don't even know if it's that's an option anymore. Every time I get close, I feel myself being dragged back ( breathing through the pain ) it's like being born all over again. Like every law in the universe is being Blaze sits forward, gritting his teeth against the pain.
NOMI: What if you're innocent?
BLAZE: Nobody's innocent. ( beat, staring at her ) Think about it. Everyone's done somethincr. You. Me
NOMI: Here, why don't you lie down for a little Blaze nods, too tired to argue. Nomi half carries him to the bed, lowers him down. Blaze settles back, exhausted. Nomi watches him, holding vigil. His eyes grow heavy. He shuts them a moment, opens them again
THE PAST: and it's Roxanne who is laying beside him now. She rolls over to face him, smiles sleepily. Blaze reaches for her, touches her face and the moment shatters into violence.
THE PRESENT: WHAM! Blaze bolts up in bed, disoriented, shaken. Clearly, some time has passed. Nomi sits across the room now, holding Blaze's tattered photographs in her hands, looking a little guilty. She's got the paper wedding band which Blaze made for Roxanne too.'
BLAZE: What are you doing?
NOMI: I'm sorry, I just
BLAZE: What time is it?
NOMI: A little after three.
BLAZE: What time, exactly?
NOMI: 3:27. Why? Blaze ignores her, jots down the time. Licks a stamp and puts it on the postcard. Leaves it on the dresser.
BLAZE: They're just a kind of record. ( hauling up his pack ) Let's go.
MEMORY FLASHES: Roxanne in the hospital, serene and beautiful. Starke handing Blaze the coin.
NOMI: You made a deal. Blaze nods.
BLAZE: Roxanne? Yeah, she's alive. She just doesn't know it. ( off Nomi' s look ) Coma. Probably never wake up.
NOMI: So he tricked you.
BLAZE: ( a tired laugh ) That's what he does, doesn't he? She nods. That's what he does.
NOMI: ( almost afraid to ask ) What about the baby? Blaze just shakes his head.
BLAZE: It's funny. That kid was supposed to be my second chance. Rox and I used to talk about it how things'd be different after she was born. Nomi didn't expect his honest vulnerability.
NOMI: Maybe that's why we have them
BLAZE: What, kids?
NOMI: ( NODDING )
BLAZE: Make him pay, somehow
NOMI: I'm sure you'll figure something out.
CARRIGAN: Based on his facial expressions, the news isn't good. He sighs, disconnects the call. Landsdale cocks an eyebrow.
ODELL: No fucking way
CARRIGAN: We're going to need reinforcements, some kind of escort to the meet.
LANDSDALE: I know a guy. Got some boys given over to wickedness and such.
CARRIGAN: ( tosses him the phone ) Make the call.
ODELL: ( fretful, pleading )
CARRIGAN: ( to Rain, leans forwards ) Hey, kiddo, you're worrying my boy here. So shut your goddamn mouth
RAIN: You can't tell me what to do. You're not my father. Wow. The truck collectively holds its breath. Carrigan settles back, but he's pissed.
CARRIGAN: You better believe that, sweetheart. I'm just the dumb-ass that financed your whole fucking life. You and your mother both. And what did I get for that selfless act of stupidity? She burned down the house and gave me something to remember her by. He's referring to the scar under his eye. Rain turns away. Huddles against the door.
LANDSDALE: Believe me, I could care less what Starke wants with you. Make you into a fucking hood ornament if he wants to. It's not like you came springing out of my loins. Only thing I care about now is getting what's mine, and that's
RAIN'S EYES: are fluttering. Extreme concentration.
THE PEN: levitates, tilts into her outstretched hands. The RADIO squeals painfully, pure strident STATIC. Odell punches a new station, but the STATIC continues, grows Rain ATTACKS, stabbing the pen into Odell's thigh. He SCREAMS, slams the brakes, loses control of the truck
ON RAIN,: weaving between the stalks. She reaches an old farm implement, uses one of the rusting blades to saw through her taped bindings. Then she's up again, running
ODELL: Man, she shot you? ( off Carrigan's nod, disbelief ) Jesus. Lucky she didn't perforate my ballsack with that fucking pen.
CARRIGAN: ( RE: HUMMER )
ODELL: Mounts are cracked, trans-axle's shot to
HELL: ( shaking his head ) this baby ain't goin' nowhere.
CARRIGAN: Fuck. Ma. Carrigan fumes, glances at Rain then he just snaps, starts angrily kicking at the door. After a few futile moments, he stops, paces, looks to Landsdale.
LANDSDALE: How `bout up there? Landsdale points past Carrigan at a squat group of buildings and machinery a shut-down ROCK QUARRY in the distance.
CARRIGAN: ( to Landsdale, anxious ) Where the fuck are those men of yours?
LANDSDALE: Don't worry. They're on their way.
BLAZE: She's alive.
NOMI: How do you know -? But Blaze isn't listening. His gaze is now fixated on the distant lights of the rock quarry.
NOMI: You think she's in there? Blaze nods.
BLAZE: No. We'll wait.
NOMI: ( taking out her gun ) You wait. I'm heading in.
BLAZE: Look, they're not going anywhere.
NOMI: You don't know that. This is probably the best chance we'll get. They're sitting ducks. We can do this if you
BLAZE: If I what? Burn them alive? Eat their You still get it, do you? The Ghost Rider whales on whoever's got it coming, but it's Johnny Blaze that gets to remember their faces. And I Lb remember them. Every last one. Just then, we hear the RUMBLE of approaching MOTORCYCLES. Lots of them. Blaze turns, SEES a line of BIKERS chugging up the service road on ratted-out Harleys.
NOMI: They know we're coming, don't they? Blaze nods. Once again, Fate is royally fucking him.
ARLO: ( GRINNING )
LANDSDALE: ( GRINNING )
ARLO: ( GRINNING )
BLAZE: I'll find her. You stay here. Nomi moves to protest, but Blaze silences her.
NOMI: I know. I'm on my own. ( beat, more plaintive now ) , Just bring her back to me. That's all I care about.
BLAZE: ( NODDING )
NOMI: ( as he turns back ) Whatever happens
BLAZE: ( as he turns back ) Whatever happens
BLAZE: You're welcome. Blaze leaves. Nomi starts in on the other bikes.
ARLO: So you need some contract work?
CARRIGAN: An escort. We're making a delivery first thing tomorrow morning.
ARLO: And will there be mayhem involved?
CARRIGAN: Yeah, I'd say a certain amount of hijinx are likely to ensue.
ARLO: Well, I'll tell you, I got nineteen brothers out there willing to go the distance and enough firepower to give a small Balkan nation a fucking titty- twister. But we don't come cheap. So how many men we going up against?
CARRIGAN: EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT WHACK! Blaze elbows Gargoyle #2 in the face. As the biker drops, we SEE that Blaze has already disabled Gargoyle #1. Blaze quietly slips in through the door.
ARLO: One man?
CARRIGAN: One man.
ARLO: You trying to diddle my nutpurse, Mister?
CARRIGAN: Absolutely not. Lemme clarify things
CARRIGAN: Like his head's on fire and shit. Arlo LAUGHS, the Pulsifers follow suit. Then Arlo turns to Landsdale, icy now.
ARLO: Brotherman, what in fuck's name is this smooth faggot talking about?
BLAZE'S POV;: The room, the men but no Rain.
LANDS DALE: He's telling the truth, Arlo. The guy ain't human. Saw him torch Albright and Chudacoff with my own eyes.
GUNT: Well, I say bring him on. You see this ink? That's a hundred hours under the needle. A motherfucking canvas of pain. He and Chester here, we're not afraid of INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - CORRIDOR - NIGHT The Gargoyle passes the doorway, lights up a smoke. Or tries to. The flame from his Zippo is bending sideways. He tries a couple more times. Same thing. Weird.
ON BLAZE: hidden in a dark alcove, struggling to contain himself. If the Gargoyle turns he will surely see him. The Gargoyle studies the flame, then notices an OPEN WINDOW nearby. He shuts it, lights his cigarette, turns back b= Blaze has moved on.
ARLO: If this guy's as lethal as you say he is, I want fifty for me, another fifty for the club. Only you can't let the boys know we're takin' a 50K rake off the top, see?
CARRIGAN: How `bout sixty and I'll throw in a kilo of coke?
ARLO: ( INCREDULOUS )
CARRIGAN: ( SIGHING )
ARLO: Ninety, and not a nickel less, you fucking pillow-biter.
CARRIGAN: E a sy, gentlemen. No need to get all
ARLO: Truculent? You get that out of a Scrabble dictionary or something? What the fuck does "truculent" mean? ( grabbing Carrigan by his shirt ) I'll tell you what it means. It means
FUCK YOU!: INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT Blaze stares, hypnotised, his face flickering from skull to flesh and back again. The tiny figure is Rain's SKELETON DOLL, held upright, unsteady, by some unseen force.
CARRIGAN: Okay, alright how about seventy-five and we'll smoke the old peace pipe?
ARLO: ( cocking the Anaconda ) How `bout eighty or you're gonna be smoking my dick?
BLAZE: EXT. QUARRY - COMPOUND - NIGHT Nomi tries to fall back into the shadows, but it's too late. The Gargoyle has spotted her. He draws a Taurus pistol
ARLO: What is that?
CHESTER: ( LISTENING )
GLINT: ( wrinkling his noise ) Smells like somethin's burning.
CARRIGAN: What-is this, fucking charades?! It's h,jM, you- ass-holes !
GARGOYLES: appear from every direction. Guns BLAZE. Bullets turn-to slag, vaporizing as they enter the Ghost Rider's aura of Rain drops from the Ghost Rider's arm, runs. The Ghost Rider advances. The Gargoyle nearest him empties a machine pistol into the Ghost Rider. The Ghost Rider reaches for the weapon. At his touch, the pistol becomes RED HOT The Gargoyle CRIES OUT. The Ghost Rider takes the pistol, and FIRES BACK. The Gargoyles stumble, clawing at their smoking wounds. In seconds, the entire weapon turns WHITE HOT, melting apart in the demon's hand, SIZZLING away into nothing The Ghost Rider keeps coming. Men are SMASHED aside, incinerated. Bravado turns to terror, to chaotic scramble
NOMI: RAIN! " Rain makes for the pickup, scrambles inside even as
RAIN! ": Rain makes for the pickup, scrambles inside even as
CHESTER: ( to Gunt, nerves failing ) Forget it, bro, live to fight another day. The Ghost Rider slams his skeletal hand on the tank of a nearby bike. The bike glows RED HOT and CHANGES SHAPE, getting bigger, nastier, demonically slouched
GUNT: No fucking way! That's my hog! As the Ghost Rider mounts the newly transformed hellcycle, Gunt charges forward, infuriated. He OPENS FIRE with his mini-â¢un, .er. rounds a second.
CHESTER: ON GUNT, images from his own subjective hell assault him. Tears stream down his cheeks as his body ignites. His corneas are burning, melting. The Ghost Rider starts to accelerate now, from zero to sixty in an eye-blink, hauling Gunt's writhing body along with him - straight into the burning building.
ON GUNT,: images from his own subjective hell assault him. Tears stream down his cheeks as his body ignites. His corneas are burning, melting. The Ghost Rider starts to accelerate now, from zero to sixty in an eye-blink, hauling Gunt's writhing body along with him - straight into the burning building.
ODELL: rushing into another room, SLAMMING a steel door behind.
RAIN: What about the Ghost Rider? We have to go back for him!
NOMI: Are you crazy?! Sit down! Then Nomi glances in the rearview mirror. Oh. My. God.
RAIN: No, no, no
BLAZE: Give me your gun! Nomi passes it back. The Gargoyles OPEN FIRE. Bullets zing and whine. Blaze shoves Gunt's cycle off the pickup bed The heavy wreck CRASHES and bounces, wasting the first Gargoyle. The others swerve around the sliding debris
CHASE: BACK TO ARLO AND THE OTHER GARGOYLES Gaining, riddling the pickup with BULLETS. Blaze is pinned in the bed, can't get off a shot
ON CARRIGAN,: hauling the Mack alongside Chester
CARRIGAN: ( yelling from the cab ) The hell you doing? I need the kid Fuck the kid and FUCK YOU!!! Chester aims the launcher again. Carrigan swerves, CRUSHES Chester under the Mack's mighty wheels.
CHESTER: Fuck the kid and FUCK YOU!!! Chester aims the launcher again. Carrigan swerves, CRUSHES Chester under the Mack's mighty wheels.
ROADWORKS: The pickup mows down barricades like dominoes, clips a hot tar cooker, spins spumes of molten tar in all directions. HIGHWAY WORKERS run for their lives. Nomi SMASHES through barricades, leaps a pile of rough gravel. Blaze is nearly hurled out the bed, but hangs on, shoulder screaming
UP AHEAD: is a concrete divider. Nomi abruptly veers right, clipping Arlo against the divider, killing him instantly.
ON BLAZE: hauling himself back into the pickup bed even as
THE MACK: bears down on them. Landsdale jumps from the cab, landing alongside Blaze. The two men struggle in the cargo bed, hand to hand, exchanging a volley of vicious blows. Nomi is desperate, doesn't know what to do. Landsdalp is getting the upper hand. He grips Blaze by the throat, forcing him over the side of the pickup bed, shoving Blaze's head towards the churning wheels of the Mack
NOMI: ( to Rain, pleading ) Do something!!!
ON RAIN,: concentrating, focusing all her energy on Landsdale. She CRIES OUT, makes a forceful hand gesture and Landsdale's glasses SHATTER. He SCREAMS, blood pouring from his eyes. Blaze rolls, throws Landsdale over his shoulder into the wheels of the Mack.
SLOW MOTION: The rolling Mack plows into the roadblock, seven tons of iron crushing cruisers and barricades alike. The pickup careens off the road, plunges into a cornfield, hits a rut, grinds to a halt
BLAZE: being surrounded by Troopers, wrestled to the ground.
ON BLAZE: chained, cuffed, struggling with TWO DEPUTIES trying to drag him to a cell. Further up, Carrigan is being similarly escorted. Blaze looks to the faces of his fellow prisoners, dread seizing his body.
BLAZE: I have to talk to the warden. You have to put me someplace else
DEPUTY #1: Should've thought of that before you pulled that "Dukes of Hazzard" stunt.
BLAZE: Please, just listen to me. Put me in solitary, anywhere but here.
DEPUTY #2: This isn't a fucking hotel, chief.
BLAZE: You don't understand, people will die WHACK! A baton blow to the knee. Blaze CRIES OUT, staggers
DEPUTY: Easy on the threats, big guy ( shouts to door control )
NUMBER TEN!: The cell door opens. Blaze struggles even more violently now.
BLAZE: Do not put me in here! Do not leave me with these men! They'll die if you do this!! ! The deputies force Blaze inside, using batons, boots. A stun gun SPARKS. Blaze falls. The cell door SLAMS. The inmates opposite are LAUGHING, waving, bashing their bars with every metal implement they've got as we
RAIN: Are we safe now? Nomi regards her sadly. She's never been one to tell lies.
NOMI: Honey, I don't know if we'll ever be Rain nods, knew the answer instinctively. Something about her look far too fatalistic for a child her age.
RAIN: He talks to me sometimes.
NOMI: My father ( beat, hesitant ) when I'm dreaming.
RAIN: My father ( beat, hesitant ) when I'm dreaming.
NOMI: ( FEARFUL )
RAIN: I don't want to be like him, mom.
NOMI: You won't.
RAIN: ( SOBBING )
NOMI: Yes, I do, baby Nomi hugs her, desperate, as if the world were ending. Outside, across the land, the sun shines gloriously bright.
A MOTH: fluttering by an outdoor light, casting distorted shadows on the stucco wall. Nomi stares, uneasy, something tugging at- her memory as we SEE
RAIN: Mom ?!
NOMI: Sweety, you have to get out of here now.
FOLLOWING NOMI: as she drags Rain into the bathroom. She tears the shower curtain back. There's a window just above the shower stall barely big enough for someone like Rain to squeeze through.
NOMI: Honey, go, GO! ?
ON CARRIGAN,: terrified, backing into the far corner of his cell.
ON NOMI: backing out of the bathroom as the front door EXPLODES OPEN. She turns around
STARKE: stands in the doorway, coyotes slouching in around his heels. The beasts attack, growing and changing, their gnashing mouths of razored teeth opening wide to consume Nomi as
CORRIDOR: EXT. WOODED RISE - NIGHT rain-slick hillside. She SEES
THE TOWN: spread out below, FIREBALLS engulfing a distant building
BOOTS: are coming. We've seen them before. These boots belong to
STARKE: navigating his way through the bedlam. He passes between rushing emergency personnel, steps over a writhing VICTIM but no one seems to notice his presence. And as he progresses to the far end of the cell block, the cacophony fades, leaving only his FOOTSTEPS as he turns into
CARRIGAN'S CELL: Carrigan is terribly burned, but still clinging to life. Frantic paramedics are running an IV, struggling to stabilize him. His fear-filled eyes grow dim, then abruptly snap into focus as he SEES
CARRI GAN: ( a choking sob ) you didn't tell us what he was Carrigan starts to slip away. The SOUNDS of the outside world begin to intrude once more. Starke kneels, touching a hand to Carrigan's chest. The world ebbs away again. The paramedics continue their work, oblivious. Carrigan MOANS.
STARKE: If I could save you, would you be willing to make a deal?
SILENT MEMORIES: assault him good times with Roxanne, happy times, making
ROXANNE,: radiant at the beach. Flickering sunshine makes her squint.
ROXANNE: folding clothes, seen through a sunny doorway.
ROXANNE: Her laughing face, loving Blaze from across a dinner table.
ROXANNE: and Blaze at the obstetrician's. On the sonogram monitor, w e SEE unborn child shifting positions within Roxanne's womb, PUSH IN on the eerily beautiful image and
RAIN: stands behind him, waif-like. Big, melancholy eyes. They stare at each other for a long time, not knowing what to say.
RAIN: My mother is dead. The statement hangs. Another death. Another failure of Blaze's part.
BLAZE: My father found us, just like she knew he Rain looks down at Blaze's hand the gun resting there. Blaze meets her gaze and tucks the gun away, embarrassed. The wind picks up. Rain looks to the graves.
RAIN: My father found us, just like she knew he Rain looks down at Blaze's hand the gun resting there. Blaze meets her gaze and tucks the gun away, embarrassed. The wind picks up. Rain looks to the graves.
BLAZE: I don't know.
RAIN: ( INSISTENT )
BLAZE: Yeah, I think there's something. Maybe not angels playing harps and stuff, but
RAIN: He'll keep coming, you know. Unless you stop him.
BLAZE: ( TIRED )
RAIN: But you'll try, right? Blaze regards her curiously. Even in grief, she's a consummate negotiator.
BLAZE: I don't have anything left to give, kid. Blaze stands, starts walking. Rain follows.
RAIN: My mother said you were a good man.
BLAZE: I'm not.
RAIN: She said I could trust you.
BLAZE: You can't.
RAIN: ( PERSISTENT )
BLAZE: I don't believe in fate.
RAIN: Maybe it believes in you. Blaze stops. Cold. Deja-vu all over again. He looks back at Rain. Sighs.
DRIVER: ( POINTING )
RAIN: We're going to a church?
BLAZE: It's not a church. It's a mission. They take people in. Blaze pays the driver. The truck roars away. Rain looks back to the mission, doubtful.
RAIN: Are you going to dump me there?
TOLBEIN: Can I help you?
BLAZE: Our car broke down a few miles back and my daughter and I were wondering if we could crash here for the night. Tolbein sizes them up doesn't like what he sees.
TOLBEIN: Don't think so.
BLAZE: What about a ride, then? Is there a town somewhere you could take us to? Other men have gathered behind Tolbein VISCOTT, WILSON. One of them, NUNEZ, nods to the South.
NUNEZ: Why don't you head back to Dawson? They got motels there.
BLAZE: That's not really an option.
TOLBEIN: Then I'd say you're out of luck.
BLAZE: Look, you must have a cot, something. The kid's hungry
BLAZE: This is Rain.
RHYMER: Rain? That's a pretty name.
TOLBEIN: Bottom line, Father. There's something wrong with those two. Especially the Duly noted, Richard.
RHYMER: Duly noted, Richard.
BLAZE: Those men outside
RHYMER: Most of them are on a work-release program. We're a halfway house for ex- offenders. We try to get people on their feet, reintegrate them into society. Blaze glances at Rain, apprehensive.
RHYMER: It's turned out beautiful, hasn't it? We try to be as self sufficient as we can, back to the earth and all that. He notices that Blaze is staring at the lowering sun.
BLAZE: I know my way around a flywheel housing.
RHYMER: Well I've got a generator out back that's been on life support the last few weeks. Mind helping me try to resuscitate it? Blaze looks at him curiously.
BLAZE: INT. BASEMENT - LATE AFTERNOON Blaze and Rhymer work by flashlight, tinkering with the old generator. There are a number of vehicles stored around them, including a pair of dusty motorcycles.
RHYMER: So how long have you been running?
BLAZE: What do you mean?
RHYMER: You know what I mean. You spend as much time around lost souls as I have, you learn how to read a man's face.
BLAZE: ( CONTINUED )
RHYMER: So what happened to her mother?
BLAZE: She's dead.
RHYMER: Did you kill her?
BLAZE: Rhymer studies Blaze, decides he believes him.
RHYMER: And who's protecting you?
MOMENTS LATER,: Blaze and Rhymer are cleaning up.
BLAZE: Listen, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I've never really been a come to Jesus kind of guy.
RHYMER: I wasn't talking about Jesus, I was talking about a little healthy introspection. Working here, staying in one place for a while, seeing what surfaces. I've found that people tend to arrive on our doorstep for a reason. Blaze considers this formidable man, a yearning moment then he shakes his head.
BLAZE: I can't stay. I'm sorry.
RHYMER: What about the girl, then? Whatever you're involved in, I can't imagine it's good for her well-being. ( beat, gentle ) We can find a home for her.
BLAZE: ( UNSURE )
RHYMER: You can take the Norton.
BLAZE: I don't have any money.
RHYMER: So send us some when you do. Blaze is moved by this man's simple humanity but he's also wrestling with the idea of abandoning Rain.
NOMI'S VOICE: He wants to know if you're a bad man. He wants to know if the Ghost Rider turned its penance stare on you, would you burn? Blaze clenches his fist around the coin, spins on his heels.
RHYMER: That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of INT. MISSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT MOVING WITH Rain down a moonlit corridor- She clutches the coyote coin like a talisman, then -
SEES SOMETHING: through a window which startles her only to realize that it's just the scarecrow out in the field, flapping wildly.
RHYMER: "That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light "
UP AHEAD,: the land falls sharply away, spilling down into a wide expanse of moonlit ocean pregnant with the promise of INT. MISSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT Rhymer and his men eat. Rain is there too. Nunez peers out into the darkness. Wind and debris are scratching at the window panes. We hear THUNDER now, too.
NUNEZ: Padre. You'd better take a look at this. Rhymer joins him. SEES what he SEES: COYOTES gathering. Six or more. They creep malevolently towards the mission.
RAIN: She's acutely conscious of the men staring at her now, still clutching the coin like a rabbit's foot.
TOLBEIN: It's her she's the one doing this.
RHYMER: That's enough, Richard.
TOLBEIN: I'm telling you, Father, there's something wrong with CRASH! One of the windows SLAMS open, startling everyone. Rhymer moves to it, latches it shut again.
TOLBEIN: What is this?! misses his throat
RHYMER: Get away from the windows!
WILSON: I ain't going nowhere with her. All the men are giving Rain a wide berth now. WHAM! Another snarling coyote hits the glass.
RHYMER: One of you, please, just take the kid to the chapel.
TOLBEIN: Father, that's the last place she should CRUNCH! Something strikes the room a massive blow. Something MUCH BIGGER than a coyote. Viscott starts praying.
NUNEZ: Quiet, Viscott! THUMP! CRUMP! More heavy blows. Like the Fist of God. Making the floorboards beneath their feet vibrate. SOMETHING shambles past the window. What in God's name was that?
TOLBEIN: ( looking at Rain, accusing ) I knEw we should've sent them away! THOOM! Another impact. THOOM!THOOM! Plaster cracks. Dust falls. Viscott wails, praying even more stridently. Nunez is losing it_
NUNEZ: SHUT THE FUCK UP, MAN! She's the one they want, I'm telling you! and the lights abruptly go ou The storm bellows and
TOLBEIN: She's the one they want, I'm telling you! and the lights abruptly go ou The storm bellows and
TOLBEIN: ( to Rhymer, hissing ) I told you Even Rhymer is shaken now. He moves to investigate, presses up against a cracked window
NUNEZ: What the fuck ?! in the frame Carrigan peers back, moonlight illuminating his face. There are buttons where his eyes should 12P. He BELLOWS:
CARRIGAN: PRIEST! GIVE ME THE GIRL! The POUNDING begins anew, harder now. The weakened door is surely about to give way. Rain is terrified.
TOLBEIN: Do what he says! Put her out!
RHYMER: Get back with the others!
TOLBEIN: We don't do what it says, that thing outside there's gonna kill us all. Rhymer steps in front of Rain, levels his shotgun at Tolbein's chest.
RHYMER: God as my witness, Richard, lay a hand on that girl and I will pull this trigger. Tolbein hesitates then grabs at the shotgun. He twists it from Rhymer's hands, SMASHES the butt across Rhymer's jaw. Rhymer sinks to the floor. Tolbein grabs Rain, drags her SCREAMING to the door. He waves the shotgun at the others
TOLBEIN: Open the fucking door! DO IT! Nunez fumbles with the lock. Rhymer recovers, throws himself at Nunez, tries stop him from opening it. The pounding ceases. All eyes sweep to the door
TWO BUTTONS: roll through the gap between the bottom of the door and the floor, coming to rest at Rhymer's feet immediately oottina the floorboards beneath them.
THE SCARECROW: A golem of dessicated flesh knitted together with straw and sodden burlap, pieces of insects, twine, and razor wire. Button-socket eyes. Jagged bone teeth. Beetle-black chitin for fingers and nails. His very existence is an affront to nature. Everything the Scarecrow touches instantly corrodes and decays. Floorboards rot, metal rusts. Every movement, every spastic shudder and twitch is a source of incalculable pain.
THE SCARECROW: stalks into their midst, snaring victims left and right, HURLING bodies or pulling them apart He snatches Viscott up by his throat. Bugs swarm over the SCREAMING parolee's face as it rots and decays. In seconds, Viscott's entire body decomposes, putrefies, falls apart
VARIOUS ANGLES: as the OTHER COYOTES do likewise. The coyotes are changing shape, enlarging, canine skeletons CRACKING and re-arranging themselves into
BLAZE'S POV: Distant thunderheads. LIGHTNING flickering. CLOSE ON Blaze, trying to drive Rain from his mind. We can SEE on his face that it's a losing battle for poor, cursed Johnny Blaze has finally understood his purpose on this earth.
THE SCARECROW: pitches through the opening, lurching forward. Jaw-beasts fall in behind him. Razor birds whirl around his head. The survivors scramble for the far exit. Rain opens every gas burner on the grill as she passes by but the far exit is locked. And Rhymer doesn't have the key! BOOM! Rhymer shotguns the lock! The lock fractures, but the exit still won't open. Tolbein starts kicking. Rhymer aims
AGAIN: ( tugging at Rhymer ) Shoot the gas!
RAIN: ( tugging at Rhymer ) Shoot the gas!
RHYMER: ( CONTINUED ) THE SCARECROW
THE SCARECROW: advances. Bugs swarm from beneath his tattered feet. Every metal implement and surface rusts as he passes.
RAIN: ( pointing at the grills )
TOLBEIN: There's no way down from here! CRACK! The door behind them splinters. The Scarecrow's found them once again.
A STAIRCASE: And still, they attack. And now the Ghost Rider is weakening. He stumbles on the steps, falls to his knees. The fiends pile atop his back
RAIN: huddled beneath a flimsy bed-frame.
SCARECROW: RAAAAINNN! RAAINN! The Scarecrow hurls aside a bed and finds Tolbein. He reaches for the man, sinking his spindly finger's into corroding into dust
RAAAAINNN! RAAINN!: The Scarecrow hurls aside a bed and finds Tolbein. He reaches for the man, sinking his spindly finger's into corroding into dust
RHYMER: aiming his shotgun, point-blank range! BLAM! The BLAST Takes a chunk out of the Scarecrow's face.
THE BATHROOM: A claustrophobic box of stalls and urinals. Rhymer and Rain are nowhere to be seen. Enraged, the Scarecrow tears into
SCARECROW: GOT YOU'. whip viciously around the Scarecrow's sodden head and torso. He's wrenched backwards, hauled out of the bathroom and SLAMMED across the dormitory into the opposite wall
GHOST BLAZE,: battered and weakened, staggering. His flames are barely flickering, his bony flesh has become chalky and brittle. He's holding a jaw-beast skeleton, drops it to the floor The Scarecrow attacks. Hand-to-hand combat. Massive blows and blocks. The burning room SHUDDERS with each impact
THE FLAMES: surrounding the two foes are starting to bend in earnest now, streaming towards Ghost Blaze's bony, begging fingertips The Scarecrow is oblivious. Just keeps pouring more misery into Ghost Blaze's body as
ON RAIN: emerging from the smouldering bathroom, ghostly white. She picks her way cautiously across the teetering floor. Kneels alongside Ghost Blaze
RAIN: Are you going to die?
GHOST BLAZE: ( WEAKLY )
THE MISSION: Topples. Ghost Blaze and Rain run but they're not going to make it. The whole room is dropging away at their heels! Ghost Blaze snatches up Rain, DIVES through a widening split in the wall even as
DAWN APPROACHING,: first light bleeding in over the distant mountains.
CARRIGAN,: back to human, hopelessly trapped deep in the wreckage. He's barely alive, just a face in the rubble. Carrigan blinks.
CARRIGAN: ( a ragged whisper ) who the fuck are you, anyway?
GHOST BLAZE: And Ghost Blaze raises his hand, HELLFIRE trickling down the length of his arm, swirling around his hand like a building static charge even as
CARRIGAN: ( terrified, yet defiant ) Do it, fucker dQ it.
RAIN: appears on a ridge just before them, eyes locking onto him. It's now or never. Ghost Blaze hesitates, hesitates then abruptly reins the flame back in. Metabolizes the fury. Pushes it down deep through sheer, agony-inducing willpower. Ghost Blaze SCREAMS, struggles and forces the Demon away, Now he's just Blaze, weak with exertion, but triumphant for the first time in years. He turns away and we
STARKE'S CADILLAC: It slows to a stop at the end of the drive, ENGINE RUMBLING. Dusty and bug-begrimed from its cross-country journey. Blaze braces himself. A silent inhalation of breath. Rain stares, paralyzed by fear The driver's door opens. A hulking silhouette steps out. The Beast, backlit by the fiery dawn which is just breaking over the horizon. Sunlight FLARES outward, briefly blinding us. And when it subsides
STARKE: is standing there. Human. Windblown. He raises a hand, shielding his gaze from the light. Steps cowards them
STARKE: Looks like we've come to the end of the road, haven't we?
BLAZE: Guess so. After a long beat:
STARKE: Give me the girl and I'll lift the curse. Blaze looks down at Rain. This was all he ever wanted. The only thing that has kept him going all these years. He reaches into his jacket, retrieving a crumpled pack of cigarettes. Plucks one out
BLAZE: She's all yours, Starke and lights it without a match, somehow conjuring the flame from within himself. He takes a long drag. In the pits of his eyes, something glows there a kind of lambent you want her. Starke stares into Blaze's eyes. Doesn't like what he SEES.
STARKE: Don't be a fool, Blaze. I'm offering you your life back.
BLAZE: That's not a life. And least now one I'm interested in living.
STARKE: You think you can control it. You can't.
BLAZE: Guess I'm willing to take my chances. Starke nods, accepting defeat. For now. He looks down at Rain, a bitter smile creeping across his face
STARKE: You have your mother's eyes. and walks away. Blaze and Rain watch him retreat. Presently, a coyote slips from shadows, joining him on the road. Itlopes along beside him. We watch them disappear over a rise. Then they're Beat. Rain studies Blaze, reaches for his hand.
RAIN: He'll be back.
BLAZE: BACK AMONGST THE SMOKING RUINS We pass broken concrete, smouldering timber, a rock snake constricting a mouse, an industry of beetles dissecting a bird's carcass. Finally, we come to a small, deep cavity and there, tucked away in the darkness, we find
BLAZE'S COIN: balanced perfectly on it's edge. How it fell like that, at the heart of the wreckage, is a mystery that will probably never be solved.
