SYLVIA: Did you know your mother redid the hallway bathroom? Large looks over, realizing she's talking to him.

LARGE: now much did they buy it for?
JESSE: A lot.
LARGE: Wow. So what are you doing now?
JESSE: They laugh.

LARGE: That's so crazy. But I mean like, are you gonna travel or like what are you gonna do? Shouldn't you like help starving kids or I'm not really motivated to do much at all. It's kind of funny, I guess I had kind of planned on my whole life being about struggling to get money. But now that I've got more than I ever dreamed, I'm really not sure what to do with myself. I stare at walls a lot.

DAVE: Can you believe that shit, Large? This guy has one idea and he's a trillionaire. I got a thousand ideas, but I gotta sit around and wait for all my relatives to die. They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book. Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty young; 17-19. As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on.
MARK: Here, bro. He passes Large the golf book.
LARGE: Oh no thanks, man.
MARK: Really? But you're like a movie star and shit.
LARGE: No, no thanks.
JESSE: Well then here. Eat this. Jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of E with a SMILEY FACE on it.
Â¢: Large takes it in his hand and thinks about it. He looks around at everyone else in the room eating them; including the cute girls.
LARGE: I guess I'll see youguyslater. He eats the hit. They laugh.
DANA: Should we play a game?
DAVE: other than golf? They laugh.
KELLY: No, let's play Spin The Bottle. The idea is met with mixed reaction from the group.
LARGE: ( TO JESSE )
JESSE: They're all legal. I think. He smiles a toothy grin. KELLY, a young hot girl with a raspy voice takes control.
KELLY: Well we just ate all this fuckin' ex, what the hell else are we gonna The girl has a point.
JESSE: The girl has a point.
MARK: Okay, how 'bout this. He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around !.to First let's finish Daddy's golf tequila. Then we can use this The group loves this idea- As they laugh and party the CAIa.ERA FINDS ITS WAY to Large's face as he feels the weed and the beginning of his trip. His eyes and face navigate the ha3mnv THE REST OF THIS SCENE WILL VACILLATE BETWEEN REGULAR, SPED- UP AND SLOW MOTION. The party seems to fast forward around Large; the MUSIC FADES TO ONE LOW NOTE until it breaks with people calling his name.
ALL: He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed directly at him.
JESSE: Largeman, this is Dana. Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes with before. She smiles at him. Awkwardness fills the room.
DANA: ( snapping out of it ) Oh, who's up? They all laugh. She gets up and slowly walks over to the couch. She smiles nervously. Large stares at her. we see in his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap. The MUSIC PLAYS. Everyone is speechless. she slowly leans in. Eye contact. They kiss softly enjoying every second. Its incredibly sexy.

JESSE: This is gonna be a good night. Everything SPEEDS-UP and SLOWS DOWN. A barrage of images: people hooking up, girls kissing girls, guys feeling girls up, joints being passed, one girl crying, Mark showing off his golf swing, Large trying to take deep breaths, Jesse and Dave hugging, two-figures moving quickly under a blanket. Kenny in full riot gear letting people take turns hitting him in his helmet. FASTER : hands gripping each other, a nose on a neck, hands gripping a waist. Ecu s Largos face as his eyes swim in their eocketo s end the corners of his mouth lift with the idea of a smile..
CAROL: it's good isn't it. No one responds, so Tim nods to be nice.

CAROL: Mark, he's a knight.
MARK: He's just a fast-food knight.
TIM: I should get going anyway. He gets up to leave. But his sword gets caught between his chair and the table. They all watch as he fumbles to undo himself. He's like John Ritter at his finest. Large and Mark just laugh.
LARGE: YOU ASSHOLE:
MARK: My Mom did it.
CAROL: What's this? She finds a long, thin cigarette with lipstick on it in the ashtray and lights it.
MARX: What the fuck is that shit, Mom?
CAROL: Where's this? Gimme a hit of that.
MARK: Don't bring those fucking people here anymore, Mom. Or I'm leaving. I'm serious. No Medieval Times people in this house. He passes the bong to his Mom. She smokes it, then sits down, forcing them both to slide over. Several cats surround her_

CAROL: Don't sit in here all day you guys; I took the batteries outta that carbon monoxide detector 'cause it was beeping all night. She slams the front door.

MRS. LUBIN: Thank you. She site. Large turns back to his paperwork. He fills out a line before he notices the "seeing-eye-dog" has wandered over to him. Large looks at him.
LARGE: ( cold, disinterested ) Hi, how are you? The dog looks both ways before mounting Large's leg and proceeds to thrust his groin to and fro. Large tries to shove him off. He looks back at the blind woman who stares off in the other direction. Large is about to say something to her but he stops himself.
GIRL: Kick his balls.
GIRL: ( IMPERSONATING RECEPTIONIST )
( IMPERSONATING: RECEPTIONIST )
RECEPTIONIST ): Not yet Mrs. Lubin. The dog humps away. The girl comes over and sits one seat away from Large.
LARGE: I don't want to hurt him.
GIRL: It's the only way to teach them. I have three Dobermans. If I didn't kick them in the balls regularly I'd never get anything done.
LARGE: Yeah, but I don't want to like destroy future generations of charitable dogs. Besides he's got to be close to finishing by now.

SAM: Are you really retarded? He stares at her.
LARGE: That's cool. Great job, man. You were- I mean I thought you were really retarded. You were just as good as that corky kid and he's really retarded. I mean if there's some kind of like retarded Emmy you could win. You'd kick Corky's ass.

LARGE: I got to fill this thing out, but thank you for. that.
SAM: Oh, okay. Right on. My cousin's an actor. Jake Ryan Winters. I doubt you'd know him. He was on "Sheena" once as some gnome or something. I think that's great though.
LARGE: Thank you.
SAM: Oh that last scene where you make that speech to the whole stadium and your Dad gives you the thumbs up; that was - it was emotional. I mean I didn't cry, but I think my Dad did.
LARGE: Well thanks. Thank you.
SAM: So are you doing anything else?
LARGE: No. Not right now I'm just.
SAM: Any other retarded roles? I'm sure you could definitely get more of No, I'm just auditioning and.,.
LARGE: No, I'm just auditioning and.,.
SAM: I can't believe you're not really retarded. Jake's not a very good actor. I mean on "Sheens" you couldn't really tell 'cause he was in a hairy gnome suit, but he used to put on these really low-budge renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals in our attic when we were kids and they were awful. It sucks 'cause there isn't a whole lotta work for little people, you know? Anyway sorry I talk too much, fill out your forms. Large just stares at her. She's funny.
LARGE: What are you listening to?

LARGE: That's cool. I like it.
SAM: So what are you doing here?
LARGE: What are you doing here?
SAM: Waiting for a friend. You?
LARGE: I'm uh. there's a_..
SAM: Fuck, that was nosey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be nosey. That was so nosey.
LARGE: Its al=ight. I. I uh get headaches. So I just wanna have that checked out.
SAM: Andrew Largeman?
RECEPTIONIST: Andrew Largeman?
LARGE: We're ready for you.
RECEPTIONIST: We're ready for you.

DOCTOR: Mr. Andrew Largeman.
LARGE: Yes - hi.
DOCTOR: There's absolutely nothing wrong with you. Large stares.
LARGE: I'm just kidding, how would I know They shape hands.
DOCTOR: I'm just kidding, how would I know They shape hands.
LARGE: They shape hands.
DOCTOR: I'm Doctor Cohen. What can we do for you today, Andrew?
LARGE: I've been having these really intense headaches. They only last for a split second and then they're gone. It's like a lightning flash; almost like a surge of electricity and then it's gone. He looks at the chart.
DOCTOR: You're Gideon's kid. I didn't even put the two together.
LARGE: I'm sorry about you're Mother.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry about you're Mother.
LARGE: Yeah. Thank you.
DOCTOR: I must have missed you at Shiva last night.
LARGE: So how long have these headaches been going on?
DOCTOR: So how long have these headaches been going on?
LARGE: Well I think I've had them in some form since I was a little kid. But they've been getting more and more frequent over the last year.
DOCTOR: ( looking at chart ) How long have you been on the Oh uh, I've been on some form of it since I was ten or so.
LARGE: Oh uh, I've been on some form of it since I was ten or so.
DOCTOR: And what about Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Depakote; did any of that ever help you?
LARGE: No. I mean I don't know. It's recently occurred to me that I might not even have a problem. only I'd never know it, because as far back as I can remember I've been medicated. I grew up on it. I left them in LA. This is the first time I haven't had it in my body since I can remember.
DOCTOR: Well it'll leave your body pretty fast. I'll write you a Actually I. was thinking about taking a little vacation.
LARGE: Actually I. was thinking about taking a little vacation.
Â¢ 42: Have you spoken to your psychiatrist about that?
DOCTOR: Have you spoken to your psychiatrist about that?
LARGE: E )h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad. So uh. he. I think he'd prefer me to stay on it. He likes to think it makes me happy. And I let him think that because he's sort of consumed by the idea of making everyone happy.
DOCTOR: Well look, I'll examine you and give you a Catscan just so you won't worry that it's anything serious. But to be honest, I think the headaches are something else. Our bodies do very funny things when they're consumed with stress and anxiety. Things you'd never expect. I found my ex-best friend's cuff links in my wife's puree and I couldn't get an erection for a year and a half.
LARGE: But that doesn't really feel like it. I mean I don't feel stressed or really anxious at all.
DOCTOR: Well with all the Lithium he's had you on it's amazing you can even hear me right now_
LARGE: Oh, right.
DOCTOR: First of all, I do think you need to find a psychiatrist that isn't your father. That just's something that should have been remedied years ago. He knows better. Secondly, I'm not in a position to comment on whether or not you should stay on the meds or not; I don't know your story. But my opinion, since you're paying for it, is that those drugs may help as a means to an end. But if you're not In any sort of therapy, sooner or later what's ever going on in your mind will find a way to peek it's little head out of the water. Just something to think about.

And we just couldn't. We couldn't sit there and not help those children. So we sent him letters and pictures for years and then I got really into ice skating and we kind of forgot about'em. Then one day the phone rang and it was Titembay and he was at the dry cleaners around the corner and he said that he was going to school at Rutgers and living in the dorms, but since he was used to living with his tribe he'd much rather live with his family.
LARGE: Yeah and he's been here ever since. He's an amazing guy, you gotta hear some of his stories. I mean this guy struggled through so much because he wanted to learn. I think of what he's accomplished and I just feel so lazy. He's studying criminal justice at Rutgers right now and when he was a baby he was one of those kids with flies all over his face.

SAM: Wow, so you're like really Jewish? Large laughs.
LARGE: No I'm not. I mean I'm Jewish, but I'm not really Jewish. I don't do anything Jewish. I don't go to temple or anything. But I don't know any Jews who go to temple. The Jews I know only go on Yom Kippur. One day; the day of repentance. Did you know that most temples are designed with movable walls so that on the one day of the year when â¢ everyone comes to repent they can actually make the room big enough to hold everyone?

LARGE: No. Trust me yours was good enough for both of us.
SAM: Come on. What are you shy? This is your chance to do something that has never, ever been done before and will never be copied throughout human existence. If nothing else, you'll be remembered as the only person who ever did this. He stares at her. She's not gonna let up. Large lifts his index finger in the air and twirlsa it.

LARGE: ( with a laugh ) Why are you crying?
SAM: I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm not usually like this. It's just so sad. It's so tragic. Isn't it? It is. It's like real life tragedy or Look, let's change the subject, okay? Let's really bring the focus back to Jelly. I mean what could be ruder than talking about someone else who died while you're in the act of burying a close friend.

CYNTHIA: What, you didn't think people would Seems to me the only thing more depressing than a funeral is a funeral where no one shows up. Don't you ever think about who'll show up to yours?
LARGE: Seems to me the only thing more depressing than a funeral is a funeral where no one shows up. Don't you ever think about who'll show up to yours?
CYNTHIA: No. Right now I'm alive, so I think about living.
LARGE: It's one way to determine who your friends are. The people who'd show up at my funeral if it was held in their state, that's one level of friend. But my real friends, the people who really love me, they'd come if it was on the other side of the country.
CYNTHIA: So where do I fall into that?
LARGE: You'd be there.
CYNTHIA: Oh you think so?
LARGE: I do. I think you'd show up because the truth is, that you really did miss met you always thought of me as the brother you never had. But you've got too much pride to let me know that. You want to pout 'cause I don't return your calls.
CYNTHIA: you're way more talkative than I Today I've been more talkative than I remember.
LARGE: Today I've been more talkative than I remember.
CYNTHIA: What about mine?
LARGE: Funeral? Honestly? I probably wouldn't travel for it- no. But don't worry, I'm sure you'll have a great turnout.
CYNTHIA: Why do you say that?
LARGE: 'Cause there's also the guy who lives his life to insure a good turnout. I think that's how my Dad lives his-, like he's sort of writing his own eulogy as he goes and making life choices dependent on how it will sound in a speech.
CYNTHIA: Are you implying that that's why I'm going to med school or I'm just saying a lot of people - not necessarily you - a lot of people try and accumulate accolades that will somehow justify their It's said we spend ninety-five percent of our lives trying to look Where do I sign up for not caring?

LARGE: Where do I sign up for not caring?
CYNTHIA: How about sucking it up and really having it out with your Dad? That would be a tremendous step towards not needing to look good.
LARGE: Wow, that was so clever how you did that. Is he grooming you to be a psychiatrist too? Med school's one thing, but please don't become him.
CYNTHIA: He's one of the most caring people I've ever met.
LARGE: well you would say that; you're the son and daughter he never had. Hell, you're the family he never had. Has he got you on Lithium yet? Wait till he does, you'll love him even more. He stands.
CYNTHIA: I bet my Mom a dollar you were coming home with a message. I said after nine years, he's definitely coming home with a message.

GIDEON: No I can. I know. I figured you would want to.
LARGE: But we don't have to do it now. I mean you don't have to do that now. It's just at some point I would. I have some questions.
GIDEON: I knew that you would. Occasionally she would hum.., your Mother. Always the same tune and I never knew what the song was. I don't even know if it was a song or if she just made it up - It's funny because it always struck me as so out of character for her and every time she did it. I just always liked it. But I never told her I could hear her because I knew if I ever did she would stop.
LARGE: So she didn't yell or.
GIDEON: No. I didn't hear anything. The TV was on pretty loud. I always watch the weather report before I go to It's just weird.
LARGE: It's just weird.
GIDEON: I don't know, it's just that you'd think if someone was really drowning to death they would scream. I mean really scream from the terror of it all, you know? They would splash and scream I would think; I would have thought.

GIDEON: What? No.
LARGE: Its not that.
GIDEON: Its not that.
LARGE: I'm just saying did they check? I mean has someone ruled that out?
GIDEON: No. Because they know she drowned, I'm just saying the facts.
LARGE: I'm just saying the facts.
GIDEON: And I suppose it doesn't even really matter. But I'd be curious to know. I would like to know if that's what happened; just for me. I mean would that surprise you?

GIDEON: No. Yee!

GIDEON: I know! Do you think I don't know?!
LARGE: And c'mon let's be honest; she tried it before.
GIDEON: Shut-up! .lust shut your fucking Large is taken aback.

OLIVIA: Let's just show him the "Florida Stars of the Ice" opening; the Gator costume.
SAM: Mom. I'm asking you seriously.
LARGE: Don't be shy. Just let me see it.
OLIVIA: Oh, she wants you to see it. How could you not want him to see how talented you are?
SAM: They cross to the TV room where they find Titembay wearing rubber gloves, seated next to an open tool box, dusting the coffee table for fingerprints and referring to an open text book. White powder reveals fingerprints ( and pawprints ) everywhere, including the TV screen.
OLIVIA: Honey what are you doing?
TITEMBAY: I'm dusting for prints.
OLIVIA: Well do you think we could move the crime scene to the kitchen? I want to show Andrew Sam skating.
TITEMHAY: But someone's been pissing on my Gamecube and I'm about to close the It wasn't me your honor.

SAM: I can't believe you're showing him THE SHAKY, AMATEUR VIDEO comes up on the screen: a person in a full alligator costume wearing white gloves skates onto the ice. The lights come down except for a spotlight on the There she is.
OLIVIA: There she is.
LARGE: You're the alligator?
OLIVIA: You can tell by the hands. The alligator skates in and out of the white fingerprints on the TV screen to classical music. We begin to see that Sam is a talented skater. In a very odd way, it's beautiful.
TITEMBAY: Here comes the Double Axle.
OLIVIA: And. land! I mean come on. Isn't she good? Large, Titembay and Olivia APPLAUD. As they do, the LIGHTS in the room SWITCH ON and OFF. Titembay CLAPS twice to turn them back on.
LARGE: That was so good. You're Mom's right you were amazing. Titembay has begun brushing white powder on Large's water glass revealing his fingerprints.
SAM: That was so good. You're Mom's right you were amazing. Titembay has begun brushing white powder on Large's water glass revealing his fingerprints.
LARGE: That was so good. You're Mom's right you were amazing. Titembay has begun brushing white powder on Large's water glass revealing his fingerprints.

LARGE: TITEMBAY ( 0.5. ) INT. BAR NIGHT Sam and Large sit in a booth of a local Irish pub drinki ng pints. They're buzzed.
LARGE: It was the only thing I ever really liked doing; pretending to be someone else.
SAM: Oh c'mon. Don't ya see that it's a joke. If you can't laugh at yourself life's gonna seem a lot longer than you'd like.
LARGE: So what should we laugh at you I lied again. I have epilepsy.
SAM: I lied again. I have epilepsy.
LARGE: Which part are we laughing about?
SAM: I had a seizure in the law office where I work and they said their insurance would only cover me if I wore "preventative covering".
LARGE: Preventative covering?
SAM: The helmet I was carrying. Large is silent.
LARGE: I haven't cried since I was a little kid. I didn't cry at my mother's funeral. I wanted to-
SAM: What do you mean?
LARGE: Oh, no. Mark, Dave and Jesse appear with some others.
MARK: Hey. Nice to meet you.
JESSE: I'm sorry I yelled- 'vagina' just now, I didn't see you.
DAVE: I'm sorry I yelled- 'vagina' just now, I didn't see you.
MARK: I'm sorry I yelled- 'vagina' just now, I didn't see you.
SAM: It's okay.
MARK: Nice. Let's get fucked up. Off Large's smile we:
MARK: One, two, three! Everyone jumps into the pool SCREAMING except for Large. He stands there staring at the water.
SAM: Hey! what are you doing?
DAVE: Largeman, get the fuck in the pool.
GIRL: oh, it's so warm!
SAM: Can you swim?
LARGE: 'Course I can swim. JUMP CUT TO. Large in the shallow-end doing the most pathetic doggy paddle you've ever seen. Everyone stares in disbelief.
JESSE: Dude maybe you should stay on the steps; I don't know CPR.
MARK: You look like a drunken beaver. They all laugh- Sam swims over to him sitting on the steps. She smiles at him.
LARGE: ( in a whisper ) I never learned how to swim.
SAM: Fooled me. I thought you just had a Or two. He smiles.
LARGE: There's a handful of normal kid things I kinda missed.
SAM: There's a handful of normal kid things I kinda wish I'd missed. She floats on her back beside him.
LARGE: Probably till my fingers get ( with a laugh ) No, I mean in Jersey.
SAM: ( with a laugh ) No, I mean in Jersey.
LARGE: Oh. I think I'll probably head home the day after tomorrow. well, LA. That's not my home. Rer smile fades.
SAM: I still feel at home in my house.
LARGE: You'll gee when you move out. It just kind of happens one day and it's gone. And you feel like you can never get it back. it's like you feel homesick for a place that doesn't even exist. But maybe it's like this rite of passage, you know? And you won't ever have that feeling again until you create a A new idea of "home" for yourself, for the family you start, for your kids. It's like this cycle.
SAM: INT. JESSE'S MANSION: LIVING ROOM LATER An enormous and desolate LIVING ROOM devoid of any furniture or decoration. Mark, Jesse, Sam and Large sit huddled under towels at the foot of a colossal fire place that houses a small blaze. They eat potato chips and drink canned beer. They are all pretty tipsy. Mark plays with a "Silent Velcro" How 'bout some fucking furniture I bought a chair but I didn't like Where is it?
MARK: How 'bout some fucking furniture I bought a chair but I didn't like Where is it?
JESSE: I bought a chair but I didn't like Where is it?
SAM: Where is it?
JESSE: Its keeping us warm.
MARK: Silent Velcro. Lucky motherfucker. I got an idea: loud tape, we'll make millions.
LARGE: I feel like if I had showed up at school and presented the idea of silent Velcro they would have sent me away a whole lot sooner. They all laugh.
SAM: So why did they send you away? She takes a sip of her beer.
JESSE: Whoa, listen to this girl.
LARGE: They didn't send me away.
MARK: You're the one who said they sent you away.
LARGE: I mean they did, but. they sent me to boarding school. "Sent me away" implies I went to some asylum or something. There were no straps Why did they send you to boarding Large looks to Jesse and Mark.
SAM: Why did they send you to boarding Large looks to Jesse and Mark.
LARGE: They sent me to boarding school because uh. they thought I might be dangerous.
SAM: ( SARCASTIC )
MARK: I'm dangerous and I didn't get to go to boarding school.
LARGE: I was a kid and I was - they just. I was a teenager and they were depressed and it just wasn't a good combo.
SAM: But obviously something happened. I mean there must have been an event.
JESSE: You're like a little detective.
LARGE: I know. You and Titembay should go into business together; solve mysteries out of a van.
SAM: Am I being too nosey?
LARGE: No. No. I just. it's fine.. I just haven't ever really talked about To be honest, I never really knew either. I mean I heard stories.
JESSE: To be honest, I never really knew either. I mean I heard stories.
LARGE: You wanna know?
SAM: Really, really?
LARGE: Really, really?
MARK: You're gay.
LARGE: No. Drumroll. I was the reason she was in a wheelchair.
SAM: Shut up.
MARX: Fuck you.
LARGE: No, it's the truth.
SAM: It was a complete freak accident. I mean its one of those things that you replay a million times in your head and you see so clearly what a freak thing it was. I. Say whole life she was depressed for no reason. Look at this picture. He pulls the picture of he and Cynthia as children wearing chicken slippers out of his wallet.

Say whole life she was depressed for no reason. Look at this picture. He pulls the picture of he and Cynthia as children wearing chicken slippers out of his wallet.
SAM: You couldn't make her happy.
LARGE: Yeah. Fuck yeah. And any other time, she would have just yelled at me and sent me to my room, but this time, in that moment, the door of the dishwasher was open. The latch on it was broken and it would just randomly fall open. That fucking latch; it's funny how so much of my life hasbeendetermined by a quarterinchpiece of plastic. So she fellbackover the door and her neck hitthekitchen counter; paralyzing her from the waist down. Sam's eyes are wide in shock.
SAM: Oh my God.
E: Still want to compare fucked up But your Mom was in the wheelchair long before you left.
LARGE: Still want to compare fucked up But your Mom was in the wheelchair long before you left.
JESSE: But your Mom was in the wheelchair long before you left.
LARGE: Well I was nine. They sent me to therapy and my Father put me on these drugs that were supposed to "curb my anger". And I've been on some form of them ever since. My Mother who was clinically depressed before the accident, sank even lower to the point where she just ignored everyone but our housekeeper, Janice and her daughter, Cynthia. And when I was sixteen my psychiatrist Dad came around to the conclusion that it might not be the healthiest environment for me to be growing up in. So he sent me to boarding school. And I haven't been home Until now.
SAM: Until now.
MARK: For her funeral.
LARGE: Until now for her funeral. I'm off to a ripping start in this life, huh? Next time through I think I'll lay low out of the gate. He takes a sip of his beer.
SAM: It sounds like a punishment.
LARGE: I think it was. So I left them in LA. I'm taking myself off Please don't remind me.
MARK: Please don't remind me.
JESSE: All he heard of that whole story was "left drugs in LA".
MARK: Fuck you.
JESSE: A 19 year old girl from the pool comes around the corner
DRIPPING WET_: Mark? Where's the sauna? Mark and Jesse look at each other. They race towards her tripping drunkenly on towels and pushing each other out of the way. Sam smiles at Large. Her face glowswarm from the fire.
GIRL: Mark? Where's the sauna? Mark and Jesse look at each other. They race towards her tripping drunkenly on towels and pushing each other out of the way. Sam smiles at Large. Her face glowswarm from the fire.
LARGE: You're "in it" right now aren't what do you mean?
SAM: You're "in it" right now aren't what do you mean?
LARGE: what do you mean?
SAM: My Mom always says that when she can see I'm like working something big out she'll say, "Are you in it right now?" And I look at you, and you tell me this story and. you're. you're definitely "in it" right now.
LARGE: I think you're right. I'm "in it". But I'm so glad I'm "in it" 'cause I'm working it all out, you know? I haven't swallowed a pill in four days now and I can already feel this eerie clarity. It's probably the reason I just can't stop fucking talking; these.rusty cogs in my brain have started spinning. fast.
SAM: Maybe that's why you've been getting those headaches.
N: Alright can we just forget about all that stuff please and talk about good etuff.

MARK: It's hardly the bottom, dude. Did you see that cliff? Albert returns with FAYE, an equally gentle and caring looking woman in her early thirties.
ALBERT: This is my wife, Faye.
ALL: Hi. Hello.
FAYE: Hi. Welcome.
ALBERT: This is Mark and Sam and Large, Diego told me when he called. Please have a seat, make yourselves Its really coming down out there, Yeah, it just started pouring all of a sudden.
MARK: Diego told me when he called. Please have a seat, make yourselves Its really coming down out there, Yeah, it just started pouring all of a sudden.
YEAH_: Diego told me when he called. Please have a seat, make yourselves Its really coming down out there, Yeah, it just started pouring all of a sudden.
ALBERT: Diego told me when he called. Please have a seat, make yourselves Its really coming down out there, Yeah, it just started pouring all of a sudden.
FAYE: Its really coming down out there, Yeah, it just started pouring all of a sudden.
LARGE: Yeah, it just started pouring all of a sudden.
ALBERT: Well in a bad storm I like to pretend this old boat's my own private "ark". Unfortunately, if this is the apocalypse, I'm not quite sure it still floats.
FAYE: Would any of you like some tea?
SAM: I'd love some tea. Large and Mark look at her.
LARGE: No thanks.
MARX: No.. thanks. Faye crosses to a small kitchen. They all sit there politely nodding at each other.
LARGE: What is it that you do here? What is this place?
ALBERT: Good question. We're calling it Kiernan's Fault. And no one's really quite sure what it is because they haven't been able to explore it. They're locked in a legal battle over who has the rights to the land.
LARGE: Oh. Wow.
ALBERT: What they don't know is that I'm a geologist working undercover for the preservation lobby. So, at night. I go down.
FAYE: He's documenting it to support their case.
SAM: Wow. So how deep does it go?
ALBERT: No one really knows. I've been in the furthest and that was about two miles down. But I like to pretend it's infinite.
SAM: It's kind of an odd job isn't it? Guardian of an infinite abyss?
ALBERT: Yeah, I guess it is. We also trade and deal in antique jewelry. I suppose it's pretty odd for you that we live down here like this-
SAM: Not at all.
LARGE: Not at all.
MARK: Never crossed my mind.
ALBERT: But we think it's important.
LARGE: Why? What do you think you'll find?
ALBERT: I don't know. It's exciting. New frontiers are hard to come by these days. I guess I just like the idea of discovering something.
LARGE: Yeah. "Albert's Abyss".
ALBERT: Who knows? Maybe. But I used to think that was all that mattered. No matter what it was, as long as I could put my name on it. Like it would somehow justify the fact that I lived; that I was here. "I did that. That's mine. I got this plate on my travels." But you know what? That's all ego; none of that stuff really matters. If at the end of the day I get to be with her, if I get to be with this person right here and the baby we created, then that's all I need. Just having felt that. If I die in an hour, I know I've lived. Faye kisses his forehead.
LARGE: You know "my whole life I've had that same anxiety that if I didn't discover something or. save something or.
SAM: Save something from being Yeah. That I'll have somehow wasted my time here. And that somewhere, whatever force created us, would resent me for it.
LARGE: Yeah. That I'll have somehow wasted my time here. And that somewhere, whatever force created us, would resent me for it.
ALBERT: Well I think that force would rather remind you that "breathing's all it takes to be a miracle". He takes a deep breath. Large, Sam and mark stare at Albert; TRANSFIXED. He's like a sage.
ALBERT: Well i suppose you want what you came all the way down here for.
MARX: Yeah, that would be great.
ALBERT: It took me awhile to track this piece down. But I owe Diego huge. He pulls a small paper bag off the counter and hands it to Mark. Mark looks inside and nods his head.
MARK: That's it. Thank you. They all stand.
SAM: Well thank you for the tea.
LARGE: Yeah, thanks.
FAYE: Okay, good luck in the rain. Would you like some garbage bags or Yeah, that would be great.
LARGE: Yeah, that would be great.
ALBERT: Albert stands with his arm around Faye in their warm doorway. As the three of them climb down the ladder and head up the path. Large turns back' around.
LARGE: ( yelling over the rain ) r, Hey Albert l
ALBERT: Good luck exploring the infinite
LARGE: Good luck exploring the infinite
ABYSS1: ( with a smile ) Thank you.
ALBERT: ( with a smile ) Thank you.
HEY]: ( BEAT ) YOU TOOT
YOU TOOT: EXT. KIERNAN'S QUARRY CONTINUOUS THE GREAT MUSIC CONTINUES SLOW MOTION: Mark, Sam and Large in black garbage bag rain parkas head up the incline away from the trailer at half Large leads them to an old yellow crane that's rusty arm hangs out over the 'edge. He climbs up onto it's base. REGULAR MOTION; Large SCREAMS as loud as he can, with everything he has, like he's emptying himself into the abyss. Sam and Mark look up at him and climb up alongside Large to join hint. The three of them, in their black parkas, with their hair drenched against their heads, SCREAM as loud as they can, with everything they have in the POURING RAIN. FREEZE FRAME: The three of them smiling. A release. A perfect UNFREEZE: Sam locks eyes on Large. He stares back at her. They kiss. He wraps his hands around the back of her head and they kiss, in the pouring rain, on the edge of something.
LARGE: So I don't know if I'm gonna see I know. Don't you wanna know what's in the bag?
MARK: I know. Don't you wanna know what's in the bag?
LARGE: To be honest, I don't even care Mark pulls out the bag. It practically falls apart it's 80 wet from the rain. He pulls out an ANTIQUE NECKLACE with a square pendant on it. He puts it in Large's wet hand.
MARK: I'd be lying to ya if I told ya this was my plan all along.
LARGE: This whole day was about this?
MARK: ( NODDING )
SAM: What is it?
LARGE: It's my Mom's favorite necklace.
LARGE: No. I don't want to play this game.
SAM: Why not? I'm curious. She's sitting here, across from you and you can say anything at all. All the things you never got a chance to say.
LARGE: ( BEAT )
SAM: I really don't wanna.
LARGE: I really don't wanna.
SAM: Oh, my God, Large I think I see Yeah, I do. Don't move, we should save it or something. She finds a clear plastic cup.
LARGE: Yeah, I do. Don't move, we should save it or something. She finds a clear plastic cup.
SAM: Yeah, I do. Don't move, we should save it or something. She finds a clear plastic cup.
LARGE: I guess I could put it in my scrapbook, if I had a scrapbook. They wait.
SAM: Is that it?
LARGE: I think so. I don't feel any more Well if you do, let me know and I'll grab the cup, okay?
SAM: Well if you do, let me know and I'll grab the cup, okay?
LARGE: This was a good idea. Keep talking.
SAM: This was a good idea. Keep talking.
LARGE: It's funny; this thing reminds me of this really random memory of my mother. Its so weird, I haven't thought about this in so long, but this great memory I have where I was a little kid and I was crying for one reason or another and she was kind of holding me and rocking me back and forth. And I could see the little balls in this thing just rolling back and forth. And there was just snot dripping down my And she just handed me her sleeve and told me to just blow my nose into it. And I remember thinking, even as a very little kid, "Wow. This is love." More tears start to well and overflow from his eyes. He tries to stifle them with a LAUGH. He cradles the pendant.
SAM: oh, Large I'm never gonna be able to get all these. They laugh. She moves closer, wrapping her legs around his waist to hug him close. She kisses his-'wet cheeks.
LARGE: It's so funny isn't it? But I think that's the single most amazing moment I remember of my Mother. 'Cause she wasn't sad and she wasn't being prodded to be happy, she was just there.
SAM: To be your Mom.
LARGE: ( THROUGH TEARS )
SAM: Just let it all go. He cries with his elbow over his eyes.
LARGE: ( in a whisper ) I would say that it's Love.
SAM: Yeah, it is.
LARGE: This fucking hurts.
SAM: I know. But that. that is life. if nothing else. ( pointing to his chest ) That is life. St's real. And sometimes it burns. But maybe. it might be all there is.
LARGE: ( BAFFLED )
SAM: ( SMILING )
LARGE: Fuck. I feel like I just get so much thrown at me; like there's so much speeding by me in a day that I feel like if I look up from the sidewalk, I'll get dizzy and fall down. So it's like I just. barrel through and don't look up, so I'll just never fall, you know? And that's really. and you know it's so sad to say this, but that's really how I've been living my whole life.
SAM: Trying to barrel through.
LARGE: Well it sounds like you were due to Yeah I was. ( beat. Then with a laugh. ) Thanks Mom. ( beat, realizing ) That's funny. The definition's always confused me, but I'm pretty sure that's irony. He smiles. He wipes his tears away with his own sleeve .
SAM: Well it sounds like you were due to Yeah I was. ( beat. Then with a laugh. ) Thanks Mom. ( beat, realizing ) That's funny. The definition's always confused me, but I'm pretty sure that's irony. He smiles. He wipes his tears away with his own sleeve .
LARGE: ( REALIZING )
SAM: How do you feel? On Large's face as he thinks about that question.
LARGE: ( BEAT )
LARGE: He sits up startled.
GIDEON: Oh, hey, hey c'mon in. He finds his glasses on his chest and lifts the remote to turn off the TV.
LARGE: Sorry to wake you.
GIDEON: No, no, it's uh. I was just I've been on a pretty crazy little journey these last couple of days.
LARGE: I've been on a pretty crazy little journey these last couple of days.
GIDEON: You've been avoiding me.
LARGE: No, I just. maybe I have been.
GIDEON: I'm sure you can find plenty of things in your life to be angry about, but what I don't understand is why you're so angry at me. All I ever wanted was for everybody to be happy again, Andrew. That's all I ever wanted.
LARGE: But when were we ever all happy, Dad? I mean you always say that, but when was that? When was this time that you have in your mind that you wish we could all get back to? 'Cause I don't have it in my memory. Maybe if I did I could help steer us back there. But we You know. you and I need to work on being okay if that's not in the cards for us.
GIDEON: Well we might have a shot at it if you could just forgive yourself for what you did.
LARGE: What I did? What I did?! You know what, Dad? I'm gonna forgive myself for what I did right now: I was a little boy and somebody made a shitty latch. That's what I think now. And I'm not gonna. I mean I'm not gonna take all those drugs anymore. Because they've left me completely numb. I have felt so fucking numb to everything I have experienced in my life. And for that; I'm here to forgive you. Gideon site up against the headboard.
GIDEON: Going against your doctor's recommendation; that's a pretty weighty experiment to take on don't you think?
LARGE: ( with a chuckle ) This is my life, Dad. This is it. I've spent twenty-six years waiting for something else to start. So no, I don't think it's too much to take on. Because it's everything there I see now it's all there is.
GIDEON: Perhaps the great tragedy of my life, will be that you both deserved more than I knew how to We deserved nothing more than you. And you deserved nothing more than Large puts his hand on the center of his father's bare chest.
LARGE: We deserved nothing more than you. And you deserved nothing more than Large puts his hand on the center of his father's bare chest.
DISSOLVE TO,: INT. NEWARK AIRPORT STAIRCASE MORNING Large sits next to Sam on a staircase between two escalators.
SAM: What are you doing?
LARGE: I don't want to hurt you.
SAM: No. Why? How can you. how could you. What's going on? What happened? We can figure out the long distance thing. Don't. this is a good thing, Large. Don't. you're gonna be. please don't do Shestarts crying.
LARGE: ( THROUGH TEARS )
SAM: ( THROUGH TEARS )
LARGE: Is that true?
SAM: Look at me. Sam, look at me. This is not over. I'm not putting a period at the end of this thing. I'm putting like. an ellipses on it. Because I'm worried that if i don't go figure myself out, if I don't go land on my feet and be okay on my own, I'm gonna fuck this up. And I don't want to do that . This matters too much to me.

R: Gideon doesn't hear the voice as he bends over and tries to pick each toenail he's cut out of the thick carpet.
FEMALE VOICE: A SCREAM and a BANG from the FEMALE VOICE in the other room! GIDEON'S FACE as it whips up into frame from his task on the FEMALE VOICE ( CONT'A ) SHE SCREAMS AGAIN THROUGH WATER! He darts up off the floor and races to the open bathroom doorl He is about to enter and then he's STOPPED ABRUPTLY.

SARAH: GIDEON I
GIDEON I: SARAH IS DROWNING. Through the door we see SPLASHES OF WATER as they land on the bathroom floor. GIDEON'S FACE. he can't move; fro2en. His mind is racing; ADRENALINE. We can almost see how fast:his, mind is processing through his EYES. The WEATHER REPORT continues low in the background.
GIDEON: I need an ambulance.
SAM: What are you doing?
LARGE: Remember that idea I had about growing and working stuff out on my own and then finding you when I'd figured myself out?
SAM: The ellipses?
LARGE: Yeah the ellipses. Its dumb. It's an awful idea. And I'm not gonna do it. Because like you said, this is it. This is life. And I'm in love with you, Samantha. ( with a laugh ) I think that's the only thing I've .ever been really sure of in my whole life. I'm really fucked up right now, but I don't want to waste any more of my life without you in it. Okay?
SAM: Because I think I can do this. I know I can. I want to. We have to. Tears stream down her face. She smiles her angelic smile.
LARGE: Because I think I can do this. I know I can. I want to. We have to. Tears stream down her face. She smiles her angelic smile.
