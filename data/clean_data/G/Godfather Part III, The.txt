I: n ?T. MAATROCINA' S OFFICE ( NEW YORK CITY ) - DAY _ Sam Maatrccina is seated in his office on the thirty- third,floor of an old downtown Manhattan office build- ing. The buzzer sounds.

SECRETARY'S VOICE: A couple of gentlemen here from the Internal Revenue, Mister Maatrocina.
MAATRCCIVA: ( SCOWLS )
SECRETARY: Yes sir.
MAATROCINA: All right. Send 'em in.
ANOTEER AN=: The door buzzes open and. two young,- rather conserva- tive looking Men, enter with briefcases.
FIRST MAN: It's about your income tax, Sir.
MAATROCITA: My taxes are handled by the biggest firm of accountants in New York City. It costs me a hundred thousand doll- ars a year and you two assholes in cheap- suits are going to come in here
AND: Sam Maatroci.na breaks off. The Second Young man has hit him an open-handed karate chop on the side of the neck. Now, before Maatroctna can speak or cry cut, the Aan has hit :taatrocina a seccad chop, shat- ter .ag his adams apple.
I: ANOTHER ANGLE
ANOTHER ANGLE: As Maatrocina goes to his knees, his eyes goggling, the First Young Man has crosses to the window and opened it. Now he and the Second Young Man carry the wide-eyed New York Don to the window and throw him out.
GEARY: No. No. What I'm trying to get from you, General, is, as Director of the Central Zntelligence Agency, did you ever have any kind of order in writing authorizing you to assass- inate the head of a foreign state?
VANDERHORST: No, Sir. Z did not.
MC XISSICX: Well, come on now.. That's hardly the thing that would be put in writing, now is it?
EXRY: Well what would it be put n 44 aol writ=q?
I: MC KISSICX
CONTIII=: MC KISSICX
MC KISSICX: X suggest that it would be put into the same kind of phraseology that Henry used to his Barons when he said, 'Will, no one rid me of this turbulent priest?' He didn't tell them to go kill Thomas z6 Beckett., but the final result of it was murder in the Cathedral -
GARY: What has Thomas 3.~ Beckett got to do. witii the subject at hand? -
CSC RISSICX: If the Distinguished Senator from Nevada will refrain from Ba -halemew is beating with the gavel on his desk.
BARTSALEMEW: Gentlemen: Gentlemen!
CLOSER: as Tony takes a bite of his hot dog.
TONY: These are good. You ought to stave one.
PALMATEER: I don't have a lot of time, Tony.
TONY: First, I wanted to say that although I'm sure that I was setum to be killed down there, I never thought you were mixed up in i t.
I: CONTI': UED :
TONY: Z hear that Morehouse is being called in by the CommI tree to testify.
PALMATEER: So they tell me.
TONY: Well if he does and. I'm telling you this as a friend - he's going to bring the roof down on him self - and you too. As Pa.lmateer puts the newspaper down, looks at Tony:
TONY: That's definite, Stu.
CLOSER: as Morehouse goes to the cabin. The snap lock has been unlocked and the hatchway is open. There is a dim light in the cabin.
( OREEOUSE: P Z;? yR Down here.
MOREEOUSE: What the hell is this?
LAMPONE: Is he dead? Palmateer kneels to check Morehouse. So are you. i Lampone had leaned down, put the gun to Palmateer's head and pulled the trigger.
LAMPONE': So are you. i Lampone had leaned down, put the gun to Palmateer's head and pulled the trigger.
LOOKOUT: I . W'SMIZZOUSE - DAWN
_T: Bridge aye.
BOSUN: Bridge aye.
LOOKOUT'S VOICE: That yawl looks like it's adrift.
ANOTHER ANGLE: As Morehouse's sailboat drifts in the calm, it's sails up and motionless, it's tiller untended. The patrol boat noses up:
BOSUN: Ahoy, the yawl. You all right? - No answer. The Bosun jumps aboard.
BOSUN: Hello? Avon Lady. if anybody down there's doing anything they shouldn't, now's the time to - Tae Bosun has looked down into the cabin. 3e breaks off and turns back to the Patrol boat.
0 BOSUN: Get on the horn to base. We got two bodies here.
GRUNDELLIUS: And in conclusion, I'd like to say that I believe these hearings have served a great, good purpose. in spite of the fears that the hear- ings would do hartto the fabric of democracy, our Nation's stronger to- day in the knowledge that we do not export revolution or use murder as an extension of diplomacy.
GEARY: Hear. Hear. ANOTHER ANGLE - THE At7D IENCE Tony and Elizabeth are together. Elizabeth is applaud- ing Grundellius. Tony looks over at her.

TONY: Yes Sir. I believe so.
GEARY: If there's ever anything I can do you come see me.
TCNY: I might just take you up on that, As they exit
THEME: SLOW DISSOLVE EXT. CORLEONE COMPOUND - NIGHT We pick up the headlights of a car coming up the long approach driveway toward us. It comes past the gate, past the kennels for the guard dogs, past the guest houses and finally up to the main house where it stops. The front door to the house opens and Michael stands silhouetted against the block of yellow light. Tony gets out of the car and comes up to him. They embrace briefly and move into the house together. As the door closes behind them, we start to move up and back. The sound of the single trumpet can still be heard, playing slowly and sadly, the notes faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow streets of some old hill village in Sicily. We have pulled up and up and up c ntil everting is darkness, as we -
