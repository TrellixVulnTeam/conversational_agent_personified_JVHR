UPPER CORRIDOR: Flaemmchen steps out of the lift. She is looking around for the numbers. She moves out of scene. The Doctor, Kringelein and the bellboy with the bag, move straight down the hall. Pimenov is chatting volubly.
PIMENOV: ( to Baron ) Poor Grusinskaya how can she receive anyone. She can't theatre, trains, hotels hotels, trains
PIMENOV: ( continuing ) I must go and dress she'll be waking up and calling for me.
PREYSING'S VOICE: Come in.
PREYSING'S ROOM: Preysing has had a bath and is actually steaming from it. He stands before a long mirror, rubbing himself with a towel. He sees her through the mirror, wraps the towel around him very cutely, for a big man, and turns upon her.
PREYSING: I'm the stenographer.
FLAEMMCHEN: I'm the stenographer.
PREYSING: Then you will please wait outside. Don't hurry take your time.
FLAEMMCHEN: ( lightly ) Don't hurry take your time.
UPPER CORRIDOR: Flaemmchen emerges from Preysing's room. Baron loitering in the hall. ( Whistling as outlined ). Baron approaches, he is also whistling the same tune that Flaemmchen is whistling. She glances at him, as he continues whistling with an amusing dance step, as much as to say: "Are you mad?"
BARON: Like dancing?
FLAEMMCHEN: Not with strangers. You're a fool!
BARON: ( turning to Flaemmchen ) You're a fool!
FLAEMMCHEN: You're a fool!

BARON: Yes yes indeed but you are .a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
FLAEMMCHEN: Very little.
BARON: Too bad.
FLAEMMCHEN: Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? One that she'd bought herself?
BARON: Poor child I wish I were free tonight we Aren't you?

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE: Baron Oh, Baron!
KRINGELEIN: Kringelein is in his door in the distance radiant. He
KRINGELEIN: If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
KRINGELEIN: Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute! We are having caviar it's expensive but that makes no difference I see the Baroness is laughing.
FLAEMMCHEN: Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
SUZETTE: Ssshh! Please! Madam is asleep.
KRINGELEIN: By this time the others are entering Kringelein's room. The Baron turns back for a moment.
BARON: ( calling back quietly to Suzette ) Asleep? Ssshhh sorry!
GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM: It is typical hotel. Half-open trunks, etc. Curtains are drawn room is in semi-darkness. There is a sense of silence, except for distant music coming from the Yellow Room below. In Suzette's hands we see one of Grusinskaya's ballet slippers which she has been mending. She is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops suddenly and looks off dramatically at.
GRUSINSKAYA: Shot from her angle. She is sleeping beneath a Chinese robe, on the chaise-lounge. Apparently she has changed her position, because the hand which is outside the robe moves. The CAMERA, as though it were Suzette, moves up towards Grusinskaya. Her eyes are closed. Suzette crosses to the chaise-lounge and is looking down. Grusinskaya's eyes open suddenly. She looks at the ceiling and then her eyes turn and look straight at Suzette.
SUZETTE'S VOICE: ( quietly and reverently almost a whisper ) Madam has slept well.
GRUSINSKAYA: No, I have been awake thinking It is time for the performance.
SUZETTE'S VOICE: It is time for the performance.
GRUSINSKAYA: The performance?
SUZETTE: It is time. Always the performance every day the performance time for the I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life. Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.

SUZETTE: Mon Dieu the pearls if they were to break
GRUSINSKAYA: The pearls won't break they hold together and bring me bad luck I hate them!

PIMENOV: ( quickly ) There was there was.
GRUSINSKAYA: That theatre half empty dancing for those few I was frantic I finished the last beat and. .I waited I listened but the applause didn't come nothing. A man in the box and just the claques behind it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead it's finished.
PIMENOV: The door opens suddenly. Meierheim bursts into the room.
MEIERHEIM: What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?. Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind? .Or is that the time?
GRUSINSKAYA: I'm cancelling the engagement.
MEIERHEIM: Business of Pimenov signaling to him.
MEIERHEIM: Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha hurry, come on. Tonight there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.

PIMENOV: How is the house?
MEIERHEIM: Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz Just jazz.
PIMENOV: If the house is empty again, I don't When she gets her paint on and hears the music she'll be all right. I know these people.
MEIERHEIM: When she gets her paint on and hears the music she'll be all right. I know these people.
KRINGELEIN: You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life do you understand?
FLAEMMCHEN: You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to Yes and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
KRINGELEIN: Yes and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
KRINGELEIN: I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know. And these are real silk drapes.
FLAEMMCHEN: ( amusedly ) Silk think of that silk they are, too.
KRINGELEIN: ( who hasn't stopped talking ) Have you seen the bathroom? Hot and cold running water You see, I can get a bath whenever I like. The stenographer!

BARON: Then you know him?
KRINGELEIN: Do I know him I know him through and through.
BARON: I must I hope to see you again, Mr. Kringelein.
KRINGELEIN: You will stay, Doctor if you have nothing better to do?
DOCTOR: I have nothing better to do, Mr.
NEAR ELEVATOR: Pimenov and Meierheim are standing there. Meierheim is pushing the elevator button. The Baron stands near and pauses, he is now a changed man. He looks off as he hears the voice of Grusinskaya, off in the distance. Grusinskaya's Voice Hurry, Suzette.
GRUSINSKAYA: Shot from the Baron's angle. Grusinskaya is sweeping down the corridor, followed by Suzette.
BARON: Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
PIMENOV: Please, Baron forgive me not now here she is.
GRUSINSKAYA: My coat. Suzette I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them Why not?
GRUSINSKAYA: Suzette I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them Why not?
MEIERHEIM: Why not?
GRUSINSKAYA: Take them back, Suzette.
MEIERHEIM: You haven't time.
GRUSINSKAYA: Hurry, Suzette.
MEIERHEIM: Such nonsense.
FLASH IN: A shot of Grusinskaya's eyes as she goes down, glancing up.
FLASH IN: A shot of the reverse of him looking down. The Baron pauses, hesitates, thinks. We are interested in his action. For the first time he becomes furtive.
MEIERHEIM: ( off scene ) The car for Madam Grusinskaya.
PREYSING'S ROOM: Zinnowitz and Preysing are standing by door.
PREYSING: No news from Manchester yet Do you think we ought to postpone the Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
ZINNOWITZ: Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
PREYSING: Yes the merger must go through But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man a good husband and father I have a sense of honor I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
ZINNOWITZ: Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
PREYSING: I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
ZINNOWITZ: I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing. Don't worry. Good night.
PREYSING: Good night.
SEQUENCE "#2": FADE IN ON BLACKNESS OF PREYSING'S ROOM We hear the distant voice of Preysing and the keys of the typewriter rattling. The reason for the blackness is that Preysing's back is flat into the camera. His hands are behind his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly. It is an odd effect. We don't know quite what it is.
PREYSING'S VOICE: Both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual
PREYSING: ( repeating )
FLAEMMCHEN: ( repeating )
PREYSING: ( repeating ) ( he pauses, thinking. Picks up telephone quickly into telephone ) Is there a telegram for me yet?. Oh when it does, send it up.
PREYSING: Now, where was I? Oh sorry. Where was I?
FLAEMMCHEN: It seems a silly kind of lull.
PREYSING: It seems a silly kind of lull.
PREYSING: Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' No only occasional jobs.
FLAEMMCHEN: No only occasional jobs.
PREYSING: You pay me.
FLAEMMCHEN: You pay me.
PREYSING: You're a very unusual stenographer
FLAEMMCHEN: ( as he paces the room, it is obvious that he is trying to collect his thoughts )
PREYSING: ( as he paces the room, it is obvious that he is trying to collect his thoughts )
FLAEMMCHEN: I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty if she does her work well, seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices I'd much rather be in the movies.
PREYSING: Yes, I photograph very well. Look

BARON'S ROOM: Baron is busy changing his clothes. Chauffeur steps in, he closes the door behind him and stands there with an inquisitive look.
CHAUFFEUR: You are late the dancer's gone to the theatre.
BARON: ( very nonchalantly ) She's gone to the theatre don't you know?
CHAUFFEUR: She's gone to the theatre don't you know?

CHAUFFEUR: You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman that's the trouble with you.

BARON: Get out and leave it to me. be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam.
CHAUFFEUR: With the pearls?
BARON: With the pearls
GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY: Baron is pretty shaken by jump.
GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM: Darkness light from transom and building opposite. Business of finding key and getting pearls. INTERCUT Preysing coming out onto his balcony, bringing out with him, loud speaker of radio which announces noisily as follows:
LOUD SPEAKER: 'You are listening to the music of the Eastman Jazz Band, in the famous Yellow Room of the Grand Hotel.'
GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM: Baron starts suddenly when he hears voice and with pearls in his hand, looks cautiously out of window only to see:
GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY: The Baron knows he is trapped, if he jumps onto Preysing's balcony, Preysing is the man that will cause the alarm. Quickly he moves across the room tries the door it is locked securely. He looks for skeleton key and then remembers refusing it from the chauffeur. He is trapped in an absurd As he moves back from the door, he knocks the telephone off of the table. He watches it for a moment, realizing that the operator must now know that there is someone in Grusinskaya's He picks up the telephone, replaces the receiver, wipes finger prints off with his handkerchief. He is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring suddenly. The thought crosses his mind they they will want to know who is in the room. He lets the telephone ring. Crosses to the door again. Above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaid's voice singing an absurd song. He listens. She is coming in. The key turns in the door. Quickly he hides behind the curtains. Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging, enters the room. He is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door. After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around. We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door. The chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear from Preysing's radio. The telephone commences ringing. Chambermaid does not answer it but continues her duties. At last, because of the noise of the telephone, she picks it up and speaks.
CHAMBERMAID: No no there is no one here.
INSPECTRESS: ( to Chambermaid ) You're late. What have you been ( grumbling ) Everyone all the time says, 'Come back - come back.' They won't get out of their rooms.
CHAMBERMAID: ( grumbling ) Everyone all the time says, 'Come back - come back.' They won't get out of their rooms.
INSPECTRESS: No, Madame Grusinskaya is not here. The Western Theater?. No.
SUZETTE'S VOICE: Have you seen Madame?
CLERK'S VOICE: ( replying ) Isn't she at the theatre?
SUZETTE: Hello, hello, Mr. Pimenov? Yes. Mr. Pimenov, have they found her?. No, she is not here. Yes, I'm at the hotel.
INTERCUT: With the Baron watching.
GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY: During this action the Inspectress has waven the chambermaid out of the room. Business ad lib. Meierheim enters, he has heard the word 'Pimenov' on the telephone he takes the receiver from Suzette.
MEIERHEIM: ( into telephone ) Pimenov?. What's happening?. No, I haven't found her. Is Desprez dancing?. How is it?. Oh, all right. Keep the show going. ( bangs down receiver ) Wait till I see her, she'll pay for this this little trick is going to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach of contract.
SUZETTE: Madame is ill her nerves.
MEIERHEIM: Her nerves. What about my nerves?. Who is she anyway? Where does she think she is Russia? Those days have passed.
SUZETTE: I want to be alone.
MEIERHEIM: I want to be alone.
GRUSINSKAYA: I want to be alone.
MEIERHEIM: Where have you been?
SUZETTE: Should I Does madame wish.
GRUSINSKAYA: Suzette, please go, I want to be
MEIERHEIM: I suppose I can cancel the Vienna I wish to be alone.
GRUSINSKAYA: I wish to be alone.
MEIERHEIM: You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end.
GRUSINSKAYA: Quite suddenly as if with resolution she begins to undress. Then she becomes weary again. With a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the curtain where the Baron is standing.
BARON: We see him tense himself.
GRUSINSKAYA: She drops the garment listlessly to the floor moves out of scene.
GRUSINSKAYA: She is in a thin robe. She sits before mirror looks steadily at her face. Her head goes down suddenly in her hands and we hear her say:
GRUSINSKAYA: The end over finished
GRUSINSKAYA: The Western Theatre
GRUSINSKAYA: Western Theatre?
GRUSINSKAYA: The stage Mr. Pimonov the ballet master. Grusinskaya hurry
GRUSINSKAYA: Yes yes, I'm waiting.
GRUSINSKAYA: Hello, Pimenov? I'm at the hotel. I couldn't go on I couldn't. No, no don't .Just alone. Good night, good night, my dear goodbye. Pimenov, how is it going, badly?. Uh?. Who's dancing?. Desprez?. Oh and how is it?. Oh, oh, I see they didn't miss me?. They didn't miss me. They didn't miss me good night,
GRUSINSKAYA: ( with great humility ) Oh I'm sorry, yes. I have ( she replaces the receiver )
BARON: Please, do not be alarmed, Madam. Careful there's broken glass on the floor.
BARON: Careful there's broken glass on the floor.
BARON: ( takes a pillow from the bed throws it upon the floor over the glass, steps back )
BARON: Please do not be frightened, Madam.
GRUSINSKAYA: ( after a silence ) What do you want here?
BARON: Nothing only to be here.
GRUSINSKAYA: Why do you hide in my room?
BARON: But surely you must know because I love you.
GRUSINSKAYA: Because you love me you love me? Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
BARON: ( going over to her ) Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
GRUSINSKAYA: I was so alone always alone and suddenly you were there and said No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
BARON: Don't cry it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
GRUSINSKAYA: ( regaining control ) Nerves just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired tired of a routine I'm afraid not I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
BARON: I'm afraid not I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
GRUSINSKAYA: So you feel like coming into a lady's room and you come. What now?
BARON: ( following her ) I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
GRUSINSKAYA: She gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds it out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror. He smiles.
GRUSINSKAYA: Why do you look at me like that?
BARON: I did not know you were so beautiful. and
GRUSINSKAYA: ( bitterly ) And then ?
BARON: No irony. You're so appealing so soft so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you ever.
GRUSINSKAYA: ( involuntarily closing her eyes ) And and
BARON: How tired you are!
GRUSINSKAYA: Yes tired.
BARON: So alone.
GRUSINSKAYA: Alone. All alone. Oh, you strange strange creature.
BARON: You mustn't talk Russian to me.
GRUSINSKAYA: Strange man.
BARON: Am I quite strange to you?
GRUSINSKAYA: Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room a young officer
BARON: He disappeared. Later he was found I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's
GRUSINSKAYA: He disappeared. Later he was found I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's
BARON: I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's
GRUSINSKAYA: Go away. Who are you ?
BARON: A man who could love that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
GRUSINSKAYA: You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
BARON: I saw you just now then I saw you cry and now I see you in the mirror Grusinskaya. Oh oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya for the success of Grusinskaya for the triumph of Grusinskaya. and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases Are you listening to me Do you understand? I want you to Yes I do understand.
GRUSINSKAYA: Grusinskaya. Oh oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya for the success of Grusinskaya for the triumph of Grusinskaya. and what is she now?

BARON: What? Say it again I didn't hear.
GRUSINSKAYA: You man.

You're responsible for this painful The stage frays one's nerves. the discipline it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
GRUSINSKAYA: The stage frays one's nerves. the discipline it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
BARON: I? Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
GRUSINSKAYA: I see you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it. And what is your pleasure I should like to smoke.
BARON: ( naive as he says frankly ) I should like to smoke.
GRUSINSKAYA: Why do you smile?
BARON: Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear
GRUSINSKAYA: What can you see?
BARON: You are beautiful!
GRUSINSKAYA: Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom. I think you had better go now. The key is on the floor.
BARON: Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom. I think you had better go now. The key is on the floor.

KRINGELEIN: I oughtn't to presume, but I I'm so grateful to you it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
A MAN: ( slapping him on back )
KRINGELEIN: Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I believe me a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
A MAN: ( sings ) Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
A MAN: ( starts singing ) It's a short life and a gay one.
KRINGELEIN: ( seizing a glass of champagne ) Every glass high to life the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief brief life and the courage to live it. ( turns to Baron ) Baron, you know I've only lived since last night but that little while seems longer than all the time before all the ( he collapses suddenly onto the floor )
MAN: ANOTHER MAN
ANOTHER MAN: Poor fellow.
VOICES: ( of players mingling ) Drunk? No, he's ill. Looks ill. ( well paused over: ) He's a doctor The doctor's here He's just drunk!
DOCTOR: Gentlemen, this man is ill very ill if you will leave.
VOICES: Certainly, Doctor. Goodnight! Goodnight, Baron! Bad luck!
DRUNKEN MAN: He's not used to champagne why does he drink it?
MAN: Can I help, doctor?
DOCTOR: No, the Baron will stay.
BARON: Man leaves. During this scene the Baron has been carefully making Kringelein comfortable on the bed, bolstering pillows behind his head. Kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his hands are limp. By the business of the Baron, although we do not of course know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from Kringelein and puts it in his own pocket. We might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his inside pocket He stands looking down at Kringelein.
DOCTOR: ( drops Kringelein's hand ) It will be over in a minute.
KRINGELEIN: Over over so soon it has just Oh, the pain.
DOCTOR: Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be I'd like to live a little longer but I'm not afraid to die I'm not.
KRINGELEIN: ( mutteringly ) I'd like to live a little longer but I'm not afraid to die I'm not.
BARON: ( touching his shoulder gently ) You'll be all right, Kringelein. ( he moves from the bed takes out a cigarette, moves to the table. He seizes his drink )
KRINGELEIN'S VOICE: ( out of scene ) My pocketbook. my money in it.
DOCTOR'S VOICE: What do you say what?
DOCTOR'S VOICE: You what Oh, isn't it there?
KRINGELEIN'S VOICE: No But no I Baron, I've lost my pocketbook.
DOCTOR: There is no pocketbook here. On the floor probably.
KRINGELEIN: ( starting up suddenly ) More than fourteen thousand marks. were in that pocketbook.
DOCTOR: ( looking at Baron ) Fourteen thousand marks. One can travel one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks don't you think so, Baron?
BARON: ( with a shrug ) Quite possibly.
KRINGELEIN: Oh, I've got to find it.
DOCTOR: Stay where you are.
KRINGELEIN: No I must find it Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
KRINGELEIN: I'm all right, Doctor. There's no pain now only you don't know what that money means to a man like me.
KRINGELEIN: ( talking at intervals as he crawls looking for money ) You don't know, because you've never lived like a dog in a hole and saved and scrimped. My life hangs upon that money, Baron. Nobody gives you anything. You have to buy everything and pay cash for it. I wanted to pay for my last days with that money. Every hour costs money. I've nothing nothing but that ( he crawls along the floor on his hands and knees talking to the carpet as he looks ) I must have it back. ( he pauses breathless like an animal along the wall looking up at the men )
DOCTOR: He must find his money, Baron. Mr. Kringelein should find his pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he?
BARON: Here here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
KRINGELEIN: ( his head coming up ) Oh yes that's it you found it you found it for me, Baron.
BARON: ( quickly ) Goodnight, Kringelein. ( he moves towards the door. )
KRINGELEIN: No no please oh, don't go don't go don't leave me alone, You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
DOCTOR: You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
KRINGELEIN: Come, get up come let me help
BARON: Come, get up come let me help
BARON: You're all right now it's very late goodnight, Kringelein.
KRINGELEIN: Oh, no, stay here, Baron stay.
DOCTOR'S VOICE: Goodnight, Baron.
BARON: ( his hand presses on Kringelein's shoulder he exits )
CORRIDOR: Baron shuts door and pauses. In front of him is the door of the woman he loves. Down beyond is his own empty room. In his pockets nothing. In his CLOSEUP he makes the audience feel his problem with him. This man who has lived and whistled and love through the play becomes a tragic, lonely, harrassed figure. The Baron has broken. His fists dig into his eyes he brushes his hair back. Over this comes with almost an impertinence, a tiny whistle. He looks up and away down the corridor. The figure of Flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand. The Baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically. He walks down the corridor.
BARON: Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
FLAEMMCHEN: Looking for my room one sixty- You live here?
BARON: You live here?
FLAEMMCHEN: For tonight.
BARON: Yes oh!
FLAEMMCHEN: Yes oh!
BARON: Well such is life, Flaemmchen.
FLAEMMCHEN: And Baron, thanks so much for
FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM: Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. Except for one lamp burning the room is in darkness and empty. From the adjoining door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light. She puts down her bag quickly, tiptoes through the bathroom to his door. She peeps through.
PREYSING: ( he seizes her to him )
PREYSING: ( breathlessly ) You are late. I've been waiting for you waiting.
FLAEMMCHEN: I had to arrange about the trip.
PREYSING: You're sweet.
FLAEMMCHEN: You think so?
PREYSING: ( awkwardly ) Come here. ( he sits heavily on the bed, sitting on her night dress. )
FLAEMMCHEN: Here, hold up!
FLAEMMCHEN: Oh careful, Mr. Preysing.
PREYSING: Call me do you know would you would you like to call me by my first Oh, no.
FLAEMMCHEN: ( pulling away, glad of an excuse for conversation ) Oh, no.
PREYSING: Why not?
FLAEMMCHEN: I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
PREYSING: You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
FLAEMMCHEN: It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said: 'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
FLAEMMCHEN: That's all quite proper. But supposing I met you when you were with your wife and I called out: "Hello you big baby remember Manchester?' And you with your wife, how would you like that?
PREYSING: Please, Flaemmchen we'll leave my wife out of this.
FLAEMMCHEN: All right. I'll get undressed get
PREYSING: Aha! The Baron. What do you want I must have made a mistake.
BARON: I must have made a mistake.
PREYSING: Made a mistake remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake. Stay here. Give me that money.
PREYSING: So that's how we stand, Baron.
BARON: Look here, sir I'm completely at your mercy I'm desperate it's a matter of life or death I had to get some money tonight.
PREYSING: Indeed you must, Baron you must. Humm humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
BARON: Be quiet.
PREYSING: I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat!
PREYSING: The door is locked, Baron.
PREYSING: ( into telephone ) Hello! Hello!
BARON: Don't do that.
PREYSING: Strike me, would you? Attack me would you? Attack me
PREYSING: I'll strike you I'll strike you I'll strike you Strike me!
PREYSING: I strike you
NIGHT GIRL: Yes yes Operator Operator They are having a nice little game up there with the telephone.
PREYSING'S ROOM: New angle. Preysing is on his feet. He has replaced the receiver on the telephone, he is putting it back slowly. He is terrified. Door opens behind him. Flaemmchen, with a dressing gown on, light, filmy thing, crosses and looks down at the Baron, without a word. Preysing seizes her. Her hand goes to her head, her eyes roll; for a moment we think she is going to faint right on top of the Baron. She is trying to collect her senses, it cannot be true. We can hear nothing but the heavy breathing of Preysing and the traffic below. Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident, it is the first time we have been conscious of it. With a swift movement, Flaemmchen dashes towards the door. It is locked. She rushes back as if to cut through her own room. He reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from her, leaving her almost naked. He lunges after her. She tears through her own room.
CORRIDOR: Flaemmchen enters from her room. She looks this way and that. After all, it is Flaemmchen and not Lillian Gish, running across the ice in "Way Down East," it is Flaemmchen, a Berlin girl. She pauses to try and clear her brain. "What the hell is this what is it." The impulse naturally is to scream in alarm. She doesn't Flaemmchen's don't. She looks around. At the end of the passage is Kringelein's room. She will go there. We watch her run down the passage uncertainly. Without knocking she pushes open Kringelein's door.
KRINGELEIN'S ROOM: It is in darkness. The only light comes through the windows. The form of Kringelein lies prone upon the bed, the Doctor had just thrown a coat over him. He is still in his trousers and shirt. Like a ghost, Flaemmchen, the shreds of her filmy clothes hanging to her, crosses.
FLAEMMCHEN: ( hoarse whisper ) Mr. Kringelein Mr. Kringelein where are you?
FLAEMMCHEN: Quick Mr. Kringelein.
KRINGELEIN: Oh what what Oh oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you
KRINGELEIN: Oh oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you
FLAEMMCHEN: Quick something awful awful has happened. Go go at once, Mr. Preysing
KRINGELEIN: It occurs to him that this girl with her torn clothes must have been roughly treated by Preysing. He suddenly assumes a She slides down to the floor, by the side of the bed. Kringelein climbs out of bed, tries to help her up.
FLAEMMCHEN: Oh, don't wait go it's awful it's awful.
KRINGELEIN: Stay here.
FLAEMMCHEN: Don't wait now go Preysing. Mr. Preysing Oh, Mr. Preysing
KRINGELEIN: ( calling ) Mr. Preysing Oh, Mr. Preysing
FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM: He enters. Looks around. Looks through bathroom. Goes quickly PREYSING'S ROOM Preysing is still leaning against the table, his mouth is open, he is gaping stunned. The two hundred and four pounds has collapsed and sagged. He is staring, his victim lying a heap upon the floor, very still and quiet. His eyes come around as Kringelein enters. Kringelein crosses, looks down. Touches the Baron's hand.

GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM: Trunks standing around everywhere. Suzette is finishing packing. Grusinskaya is sitting in front of the mirror in a loose night wrap she is doing her hair.
SUZETTE: Madam should sleep.
GRUSINSKAYA: I've done my hair differently do you like that?
SUZETTE: When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
GRUSINSKAYA: ( rising ) In the middle of the night those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses. ( she pushes the window closed, shivers, it is chilly. She crosses the room turning out one of the lights ) Oh, think, Suzette the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo quiet simple happy we'll have a guest, Suzette.

SENF'S DESK: ( the old shot ) Meierheim is entering quickly goes through the door. He crosses now to Pimenov. They talk eagerly out of earshot.

But we know it's the telephone Senf comes on duty, looks around, it is apparent that he is

KRINGELEIN: So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
FLAEMMCHEN: Perhaps he really was a burglar But they don't kill a man for that.
KRINGELEIN: He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
FLAEMMCHEN: ( naively ) I didn't like Preysing right off.
