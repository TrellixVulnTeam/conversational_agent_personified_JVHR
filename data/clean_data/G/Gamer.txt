SANDRA: KABLE says nothing, just stares at her, stoic.
GUARD: Shut the fuck up.
SANDRA: ( to the GUARD, a snarl ) Putcher dick away.
GUARD: Get some.
KABLE: ( quietly ) My name's Tillman.
KABLE ): They say you only got three battles left til you get out.
OFFSCREEN VOICE: Counting down five. four. three. two.
PRODUCER: We're cunt hair close -
PRODUCER: All respect, Bob, nobody cares about dead Orientals. they care about Ken Castle -
PRODUCER: Burger chili fry?
WORLDLINK TONIGHT: with GINA PARKER SMITH
EXCLUSIVE: with GINA PARKER SMITH
VOICEOVER: First. there was society. The ultimate SIM environment - where players don't control virtual animated characters - but actual, living, breathing human beings. They walked them, they talked them. They juiced them.
KEN CASTLE: I ain't complainin'!
VOICEOVER: Nine months ago, Castle unveiled a new simulation - one that would take gaming to new heights of thrilling excess. and controversy
KEN CASTLE: ( big smile )
KEN CASTLE: Gina, when was the last time you saw someone volunteer to be murdered? I'm sure you know that every last one of our Slayers is a bona fide death row inmate - .each one offered a chance to participate as an alternative to their sentence. Stay alive for thirty sessions and get set free. that's not a bad God damned deal.
KEN CASTLE: I'd remind your audience that Slayers was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the United States federal government. that the revenue it produces is responsible for funding our entire prison system - keeping the bad guys behind bars. and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68% of the American What'd he say?
PRODUCER: ( to BOARD OP ) What'd he say?
KEN CASTLE: There's a lot of men and women in prison that could never cut it as slayers. shouldn't they have the same opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out? Besides - they only need to survive one session.
SUPERNOVA FLARE: 22 EXT SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND 22
KEN CASTLE: A 3-D ANIMATED GRAPHIC accompanies his explanation - the VIRTUAL CAMERA zooms in to the FROZEN SOLDIER'S head - and then INSIDE, passing thru transparent layers. We see a cartoon image of a tiny nano-cell - labeled with a bold, block letter N. The nano-cell approaches a normal cell next to it. there is a flash; now the cell next to it has turned into an exact copy of the nano. This continues, multiplying exponentially, until we zoom back to reveal that the entire brain has been converted to nano-cells. The graphic zooms back further to show a pair of hands working a retro ATARI-style joystick. animated waves indicate a wireless transmission from the joystick to the Slayer, who unfreezes and flies into action.
KEN CASTLE: ( coy ) Did I? You know I seem to recall that - let's just see.
KEN CASTLE: You like her? Her name is Gina. She's a good little bitch.
PRODUCER: This motherfucker is off the You realize he could buy our Why would he?
PRODUCER: ( shrugs ) Why would he?
BOARD OP: That's fuckin scary.
KEN CASTLE: Similar, yep. But control is strictly localized to the parameters of our gaming You take Society for instance: once a cast member leaves the workplace they are completely free from the control and monitoring of their That's a relief.
KEN CASTLE: ( teasing ) To some, maybe. to some. don't you suspect a good many folks wouldn't mind an itty bit of I don't. um.
KEN CASTLE: Someone else making all the decisions for you. no responsibilities, no tough choices. think about it.

KEN CASTLE: Good little talk.
PRODUCER: What the hell is that?
HUMANZ: ( CONTINUED )
HUMANZ BROTHER: Ken Castle wants you to believe that you are living in a safer, better world. He's a liar. Mind control is slavery. We will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to continue.
PRODUCER: Mr. Castle, we have no idea.
KEN CASTLE: ON THE SCREEN, the humanz logo dissolves, 8-bit ARCADE STYLE, replaced by:
PRODUCER: ( to his techies ) Bypass orbital, reroute from the backup servers, NOW, for Christ sake, you dirty apes. ( to CASTLE ) Sorry, Mr. Castle, we can't hard- line a live broadcast. It's impossible to stop every virus that sneaks in.
KEN CASTLE: Uh huh. You might wanna oughta let my boys take a look at your What about your firewall, sugar - wonder if I might breach it one of these sunny days.
BOARD OP: He's good.
PORN GIRL: Wanna blow off a little steam?
DISTINCTIVE PRISONER: Fuck him up.

PRISONER: Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings - Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams. You want to get back to them. It's all you think about. It's the only thing that keeps you alive.
KABLE: Who's talking?
KABLE: ( CONTINUED )
KABLE: Why would anyone want my name?
KABLE: ( he holds the wrinkled How did you get this picture? Have you seen them?
TED NUGENT: Damn, I gonna have to eat you now,
VOICE: Oh shit. oh shit.
VOICE: Wul hello thar. Wait for it.
KABLE: ( whispering ) Turn me around God damn it.
VOICE: What'd he say? My boy gotta take a piss or
BROWN SOLDIER: Who are they. who the fuck are they. who's playing us?
SIMON: Gay. gay. gay. super gay.
FEMALE VOICE: Swarmers. The latest innovation from Browning, this self detonating cartridge offers the widest and deadliest spray available from a full tracking, cornering ordnance.
SIMON: Daddy like.
ANNOYING GIRL: Fan-girl, stop hacking. If I want you unmuted I'll unmute you.
SIMON: Fan-girl, stop hacking. If I want you unmuted I'll unmute you.
ANNOYING GIRL: You suck, Simon - you're going to get my boyfriend killed before he can get out of jail and fill me up with his hot seed.
SIMON: Uh huh.
ANNOYING GIRL: Shut up bitch.
SIMON: What is that?
SHELLY: What's up, loser?
SIMON: Hey sissy.
SHELLY: Mom says - let me see, go to college, move the fuck out, and. oh yeah, you're a sick retard, you're pathetic, and you smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.
SIMON: Wanna make out?
SHELLY: You wish. I can't wait til they cut you off, Simian.
TWINS: ( star struck ) Oh my god, it's really you!!!
SIMON: ( star struck ) Oh my god, it's really you!!!
TWINS: ( star struck ) Oh my god, it's really you!!!
SIMON: ( in unison ) Do you wanna see our tits, Simon?
TWINS: ( in unison ) Do you wanna see our tits, Simon?
SIMON: ( shrugs ) Uh, sure.
TWIN 1: Mmmmm, now that we have your attention, here's another offer you can't refuse.
SIMON: Here we go.
TWIN 2: Fifty million euros for control of Kable, instant transfer to the account of your choice.
SIMON: Question: do I look like I need the money? We've discussed this before - Kable is not for sale.
TWIN 1: ( feeling herself up ) Baby. make it a hundred.
SIMON: It's been real.
PARTY!!!: We are in a super-saturated world. NOT virtual/animated, but absolutely real - yet the color and immediacy of it is heightened, off-kilter. On the GRASS, a gang of TOKYO POP PUNK ROCKERS are having a WATER BATTLE, blasting and soaking each other with big plastic WATER CANNONS like something out of SLAYERS. A REDHEAD, soaking wet, is FEELING UP HER OWN BREASTS, totally OBLIVIOUS to her surroundings. One of the SKATERS, out of control, PLOWS RIGHT INTO HER at full speed. The SKATER takes a ride on concrete, grinding flesh off her bare legs. she wobbles to her feet, EYES STREAMING TEARS but STILL GRINNING ecstatically. A guy in a PRIEST OUTFIT holding brightly colored helium balloons looks on impassively; then spots something of interest and breaks off SPRINTING FULL SPEED. People are DANCING - the corniest moves ever. MAKING OUT on the ground. and in the middle of it all.
GUY: He smiles like a Driver's License photo.
GORGE: 57 EXT. SOCIETY - DAY 57
ANGIE: We will continue to CUT between the two locations.
GUY: So what's your damage?
GUY: Lucky you.
DALE: You met me.
GUY: ( echoing ) You met me. I'm Nika.
ASIAN PRISONER: GET IT OUT OF ME.! What the hell happened to this one?
GUARD: What the hell happened to this one?
LIFER: Look like he escaped.
GUARD: Back to your Jazzercise, girls.
KABLE: FREEK is there.
FREEK: Who the hell is that?
KABLE: Who the hell is that?
FREEK: New dude, new dude. that's Hackman. They say he killed a whole mess of people, all kind of people. one day he just walk up and turn himself in, like he wanna be inside or some shit. never gonna run out of slayers long as they got that kind of motherfucka run around kill a mess of people.
HISPANIC GUARD: Who aims?
KABLE: ( caught off guard ) Who aims. the slayer? Or the
HISPANIC GUARD: Who aims. the slayer? Or the
KABLE: Not much to aiming. it's just hand/eye coordination. I'm the hand. someone, somewhere else is the eye.
HISPANIC GUARD: That's tripped.
KABLE: Sometimes. they take over - you know, completely. They move you. Like a robot. But it doesn't work so good. that part's just for show. You can't really fight that way.
HISPANIC GUARD: There's a delay.
KABLE: There's a delay.
HISPANIC GUARD: Yeah, the ping. they talk about that. The time it takes the slayer to respond to the command. it's like, five millisecond ping, eight millisecond ping.
KABLE: Whatever you call it. A slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there. When the trigger pulls - It's just me.
HACKMAN: Hey. Kable.
KABLE: Not interested.
HACKMAN: No. Wait. Look.
KABLE: Your head ain't on straight.
HACKMAN: I'm going to delete you too. On Yeah, probably.
KABLE: Yeah, probably.
HACKMAN: That's why they put me here. I've got no strings. So I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone. They've got strings But you can see There are no strings on me.
KABLE: - the fuck did you say?
HACKMAN: On the outside. oh, I'm sorry - I meant your pretty girls. You want to get back to them but I'm going to visit them first.
CASTLE: He's so perfect.
CASTLE 2: He's scary.
CASTLE: He changes the angle on HACKMAN'S mug to give a better view - then turns to face his DOUBLE.
CASTLE 2: ( playing dumb ) But they love Kable.
CASTLE 3: He's right.
CASTLE: ( unaffected ) They do now. But when my boy kills their hero right there in front of their eyeballs, so vivid it's like you can reach out and feel the wet flesh - Trust me, they'll change their point of view.
CASTLE 2: How can you be sure?
CASTLE: It's human nature. They'll be seduced by the power, the violence. the dominance.
CASTLE 3: ( shaking his head ) Guess we never figured on Kable blowing up as big as he did.
CASTLE: Bigger than the game? No. Then again, who ever would've imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same I-con.
CASTLE 2: Tillman is a perfect soldier, a tactical killing computer - you dropped him in with common murderers. What did you expect?
CASTLE 3: ( musing ) His instincts give him an edge.
CASTLE 2: And in the hands of a talented Of course we can never let him out. Not after what we did to him.
CASTLE 3: Of course we can never let him out. Not after what we did to him.
CASTLE 2: Tell me again why we don't just get rid of the problem. You know, off camera?
CASTLE: YOU - lack a flair for marketing. The people would never accept that. They need to SEE their gladiators brought down.
CASTLE 3: One thing I know is what makes people tick.
KABLE: SIMON ( O.S. ) ( beat )
KABLE: How come I can hear you?
KABLE: Gamers can't talk to cons.
SIMON: It's cool, yeah?
KABLE: No. Pay attention to the game.
KABLE: Wait a minute. are you twelve?
KABLE: Bullshit. This is unbelievable. How am I not dead yet?
FREEK: ( mumbling ) Gotta keep my holes down. keep `em down. Freek's gonna make it, gonna cut, gonna scatter. gonna burn this joint.
KABLE: SIMON ( O.S. )
KABLE: ( burning ) These are real humans, fucker.
KABLE: Guess that goes for me too.
KABLE: Different how?
KABLE: That way.
KABLE: Are you kidding me?
SIMON: Well, yeah - I get that for you it's different.
LATER: KABLE emerges several blocks from where he started, on a narrow block that seems distant from the heat of combat. Buildings shelter the street on either side. several blocks down a LOW WALL BLOCKS THE ROAD - marked with RED DIAGONAL STRIPES and a warning: RESTRICTED.
KABLE: We should go that way.
KABLE: Kid, trust me - I was going house to house in Tehran while you were still sucking mommy's nipple.
HACKMAN: ( friendly ) Bye Kable. What happened?
KABLE: ( to himself ) Kid's gonna get me killed.
KABLE: Listen to me. I don't know who's behind it, or why, but I was supposed to die today. They're gunning for us. I can beat them, but not with you controlling me.
SIMON: What the hell.?
KABLE: Turn me loose, kid. You want to win, turn me loose.
SIMON: Find a way.
KABLE: Find a way.
FREE: And then:
ORDER NOW!: CUT TO:
CASEWORKER: ( looks over her paperwork ) So. Miss Roth. Why are we here today. says you'd like to apply for custody of your Delia. Her name is Delia.
ANGIE: Delia. Her name is Delia.
CASEWORKER: Spouse incarcerated, life without possibility of parole. You use your maiden name.
ANGIE: My husband - he. it's not entirely true, regarding his sentence. In fact, he's due to be released soon.
CASEWORKER: Your husband was charged and convicted of first degree murder, Miss Roth. I can hardly consider his release, if it was to occur, to be a positive. You're. an actor?
ANGIE: I work in society.
CASEWORKER: Acting, is that what they call it?
ANGIE: It's a job.
CASEWORKER: Miss Roth. Your child has been. exceedingly well placed. The new family is very wealthy. She'll never want for anything. I understand you love your little girl, but. do you really think she'd be better off with people like you?
ANGIE: Yes, I do. I'm her mother.
CASEWORKER: We will give your application all the consideration that it merits.
HUMANZ BROTHER: You like the software?
SIMON: ( confused ) The walkie talkie, playa.
HUMANZ BROTHER: The walkie talkie, playa.
SIMON: No shit. you're the guy from TV. The HUMANZ.
HUMANZ BROTHER: That's right, baby. You think about what the brotha said?
SIMON: To what, um, brotha do you refer. Kable wants the freedom to ass- kick. Do shit his way. You gonna give it to him?
HUMANZ BROTHER: Kable wants the freedom to ass- kick. Do shit his way. You gonna give it to him?
SIMON: You were listening.
HUMANZ BROTHER: We see and hear everything that goes on inside the so-called game.
SIMON: Alright, then. Kable said we got lucky - that they were gunning for us - what was that all about?
HUMANZ BROTHER: Kable got a past. he knows things. Things he don't even know he know.
SIMON: Huh? What things?
HUMANZ BROTHER: Things Castle's afraid of. As long as your boy stay on the inside Castle know he can keep him quiet - but if ever got out. Uh uh. Castle will never let that One battle left, I think I can handle my bidness.
SIMON: One battle left, I think I can handle my bidness.
HUMANZ BROTHER: You're not hearing me - this is not something you can control. They gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the eyes of the world. And then what? You just another poor little rich honky. No Kable, no pussy, no
SIMON: This is, come on. too heavy. I don't know what the hell you're talking about. I just play games, man. Games.
HUMANZ BROTHER: Mm hm. That's right, it's a game. You want to win it, don't you?
SIMON: Yeah, dude, I intend to.
HUMANZ BROTHER: Then you need to cutcho strings, Imagine a slayer that don't got to wait to be told what to do. No ping, you dig? A trained killing machine. operating in real time, on pure instinct.
SIMON: That. would be cheating.
HUMANZ BROTHER: A mod, that's all. Like that guidance system you hacked on three weeks ago lets you track motherfuckers around corners and The game got to mutate, after all. It got to evolve, you feel me?
SIMON: ( nervous ) The game got to mutate, after all. It got to evolve, you feel me?
HUMANZ BROTHER: The game got to mutate, after all. It got to evolve, you feel me?
SIMON: I do. I do feel you.
HUMANZ BROTHER: Then let's rock, baby.
KABLE: WOMAN ( O.S. )
KABLE: You're not a guard. who are you?
KABLE: I don't have any.
KABLE: How do you know that?
KABLE: We'll see.
KABLE: I need you to get me something.
KABLE: FADE TO BLACK.
KABLE: ( woozy ) What happened.
KABLE: No shit.
KABLE: Blow me.
KABLE: Yeah? Anything else ya fuckin
HACKMAN: He slams his head into the windshield of a parked car, caving it in.
KABLE!!!: KABLE ignores him; he picks up his WEAPON, points it out the window at the FLY and FIRES. the FLY jukes out of the way, barely. it spins off OUT OF CONTROL and SMASHES through the window of a building. Bye, FLY.
SIMON: 97 EXT. SLAYERS RESTRICTED AREA - CONTINUOUS 97
KABLE: ( relieved ) Ughh, that was the one.
SIMON: Shit, shit, SHIT! I'm dead.
FEMALE VOICE: Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by.
FRAT GUY: What just happened?
TRACE: She's not home. But Castle's personal security will be, soon enough - trust me, you don't want to meet them. You know, it's pretty obvious that you'd come here first.
KABLE: Who are you?
TRACE: You asked me that once before.
KABLE: Your voice.
TRACE: You should really come with me. . like, NOW.
TRACE: Hang on.
HUMANZ BROTHER: You a fool.
HUMANZ DUDE: Stop playing that freaky shit off the rail.
HUMANZ BROTHER: It's a game of deception.
HUMANZ DUDE: Whatever, that's cuz you got no
HUMANZ BROTHER: You guys suck.
KABLE: You guys suck.
HUMANZ DUDE: ( impressed ) Kable. Holy shit.
HUMANZ BROTHER: His name's Tillman.
HUMANZ DUDE: ( to KABLE ) You made it. You're really here.
KABLE: You're the ones who broke me out?
TRACE: We only freed your mind.
HUMANZ BROTHER: Your ass followed.
HUMANZ DUDE: Hey, Kable. You're. great.
HUMANZ BROTHER: ( to Kable ) You got questions.
KABLE: A few. She took my blood. Why?
HUMANZ DUDE: The nanex modifies the actual cell structure of your brain.
KABLE: Alright. Why me?
HUMANZ DUDE: Because Castle's scared of you.
HUMANZ BROTHER: It ain't just a game, you know, Tillman. Everyday there's more people steppin forward, wanna be a part of Castle's world. Throwing away everything it means to be Right now it's the desperate ones. convicts, addicts. the sick, the poor. the ones that fell through the cracks. they have no choice.
TRACE: Right now it's the desperate ones. convicts, addicts. the sick, the poor. the ones that fell through the cracks. they have no choice.
HUMANZ DUDE: But this is only the beginning.
HUMANZ BROTHER: Think about it: the federal prison system is growing out of control, set to bankrupt the whole damn USA. Castle rides in on a white horse, says he got a plan to bail us out and everyone just fall in So what's next? The health care system is collapsing - Castle comes to the rescue again.
TRACE: So what's next? The health care system is collapsing - Castle comes to the rescue again.
HUMANZ BROTHER: This time he's pushin total control of genetic disease. birth defects a thing of the past. all we gotta do is exchange our cells for the ones he wanna give us.
TRACE: The promise of a longer life and a fatter wallet - you think people will refuse?
HUMANZ DUDE: Hell no.
HUMANZ BROTHER: They'll be standing in line to hand their babies over to him. Next thing you know, we all slaves.
TRACE: We can't let that happen.
HUMANZ DUDE: Gotta bring the man down.
TRACE: You can help us, Tillman. You have to help us.
KABLE: I can't help you.
HUMANZ BROTHER: KABLE ignores him - he's OUT. But HUMANZ BROTHER FREEZES him in his tracks:
AGENT KEITH: Guess you remember that day.
SIMON: Good times.
AGENT KEITH: Sure. On the outside. Now look at This is what it's like on the Wonder how long you'd last on the other side of the screen. Simon, you're being held today suspected of aiding in the escape of a convicted murderer from a maximum security penitentiary. The charge is. beyond serious. Your hard drives have been seized - forensics is decrypting the contents as we speak. Your internet activity over the last ten years is being scrutinized and catalogued in minute, vivid
SIMON: Yeah, um. I need something too.
AGENT KEITH: ( ice cold ) Do you now? And what might that be?
SIMON: Could you dudes do a sandwich like: peanut butter, almond butter, walnut butter. pecan butter, pistachio butter. pretty much any kind of, you know, nut butter. And Welch's grape.
AGENT KEITH: Pistachio. They make that?
SIMON: It's awesome.
BARTENDER: The usual?
RICK RAPE: Hi Nika.
ANGIE: Oh. Hi. Rick Rape, right? I thought you weren't allowed to come here anymore.
RICK RAPE: That was just last month. I was a bad boy.
ANGIE: Are you still a bad boy?
RICK RAPE: She TURNS. KABLE has RICK RAPE up in the air, holding him like a BARBELL - with one hand CRUSHING HIS THROAT, the other his BALLS. He brings him down over his knee, SNAPPING HIM like a BROKEN BAT
KABLE: Don't say that. This isn't you.
RAGE ): God damn it. YOU - in there. controlling her. let her talk,
KABLE: ( almost whispering ) You can hear me, baby. I know you I love you. love you.
KABLE: ( snapping )
SHUT UP!!!: He's SCREAMING directly at GORGE, who cowers in his chair as if KABLE were in the room with him. GORGE/ANGIE nods.
KABLE: ( quiet ) I'm going to take you someplace where they can turn it off. the
HACKMAN: ( friendly ) Hi, Kable.
HACKMAN: ( to ANGIE ) Anybody in there?
KABLE: YOU! WHERE THE HELL DO WE GO?
KABLE: ( to GORGE ) You. Run.
KABLE: ( quietly ) If not.
KABLE: Now what?
HUMANZ DUDE: ( shrugs ) The crack works - you're the proof. we put the DNA in the soup, light it up, extract it - then feed my girl's sequence into the code and we're good to go.
HUMANZ DUDE: Basically. We can't quarantine the foreign cells per se but we can disable their ability to transmit and receive.
TRACE: That would be like cutting out part of your brain.
KABLE: How long will she sleep?
TRACE: We're going to have to keep her sedated until we can kill the link. otherwise she's broadcasting everything she sees or Thirty minutes. you give us a robot, we give you back a super hot
HUMANZ DUDE: Thirty minutes. you give us a robot, we give you back a super hot
HUMANZ BROTHER: KABLE looks.
KABLE: So talk.
HUMANZ BROTHER: Come on.
KABLE: Yeah. He was.
HUMANZ BROTHER: The second was you.
KABLE: The idea was to replace your brain, bit by bit, cell by cell, gradual. the new tissue would never break down, never A new era in human longevity is what they told us. We were doing the world a favor.
HUMANZ BROTHER: ( nods ) Nine weeks later Scotch was dead and you were serving life in maximum. Castle's project was shut down. but the shit wasn't a total loss: the same technology resurfaced within a year. in a game. Castle called it society.
KABLE: Thank you for the history lesson.
HUMANZ BROTHER: Dig me, Tillman. Whatever happened in that project is something Castle wanna be buried. We need that shit, baby: what you saw, what you know.
KABLE: I don't know what to tell you.
HUMANZ BROTHER: You ain't gotta tell me shit, I want you to show me.
GORGE: Hooz there? What are you doing here? Who are
GEEK LEADER: Tech support.
HUMANZ BROTHER: His memories. translated as raw audiovisual data.
HUMANZ DUDE: Current exponential rate of growth, I can't imagine a piece of tech that will take that long to come They'll have better shit than this in Best Buy within 18 months.
SCOTCH: Tillman. Never thought I'd be so glad to see your ugly grille.
KABLE: ( mimicking him ) ( back in character ) I'll tell you what man: this place
SCOTCH: ( mimicking him ) ( back in character ) I'll tell you what man: this place
SCOTCH: ( to KABLE, grinning ) They got me hooked up to computers five hours a day. nurses feeding me vitamins, giving me shots, wiping my butt - male nurses, I might add.
SCOTCH: What about you? You're dressed like a semi-human being. they let you out already? I'm not getting out.
KABLE: I'm not getting out.
SCOTCH: ( confused )
KABLE: I'm fine.
SCOTCH: Uh huh. You don't look good.
KABLE: I'm sorry.
SCOTCH: ( hesitant, making light ) Well, it's not like you ever looked that good. ( quietly ) Tillman, what did they do to you?
SCOTCH: ( freaked )
KABLE: I can't stop it. can't.
SCOTCH: Who are you?
KABLE: I'm sorry.
HUMANZ DUDE: Not the best commercial for K-soft
TRACE: ( bitter ) He made him do it. Castle made him do it.
HUMANZ BROTHER: A test.
KABLE: It's you.
ANGIE: I missed you. so much.
KABLE: ( softly ) Baby. what did they do?
ANGIE: I couldn't stop them.
KABLE: Where is she?
TRACE: I'm sorry, Tillman. Guess he needed an insurance policy. She's with Castle.
KABLE: That's all the story you're going to get.
SIMON: AGENT KEITH ( sarcastic )
AGENT KEITH: ( sarcastic ) Yeah, ain't it? Looks like someone up the chain decided you're no longer a threat.
CHEATER: It's over. SIMON sits down in the middle of the detritus, in a state of mild SHOCK - he's LOST EVERYTHING.
FEMALE VOICE: No link. no link.
KABLE: . and finally breaking into a run - until: He SLAMS into what seems to be an INVISIBLE WALL, crumpling to the ground. The GIRL doesn't react. KABLE pounds on the
DELIA!: . then looks closer, running his fingers across the SMOOTH
KEN CASTLE: ( genuinely stoked ) You're awesome.
KABLE: KEN CASTLE
KEN CASTLE: They speak simultaneously:
KEN CASTLE: I've got to thank you for leading me to them, by the by - the human- zuzz that is. Of course, soon enough they'd be whistling my tune like everybody else. but meantime it was that little cracker program they dreamed up that got my attention.
KEN CASTLE: But mine's different. Built to send - to transmit . Whereas every other K-soft cell out there - including the ones in. your head, Kable - is designed to receive. I think it, you do it. We're talking every Slayer, everyone in Society City. I believe your better half would fall under that category. provided they're within range of my
KABLE: ( sarcastic ) Very nice, Castle. So you've got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you.
KEN CASTLE: You're thinking small, Kable. But not as small as me.
KABLE: You should've let him fight for himself, Castle - he might've had a I think you're missing the point, my man.
KEN CASTLE: ( pleasant ) I think you're missing the point, my man.
KABLE: No, I get it - you're pulling the strings on all of this. . which makes my next move pretty easy to figure.
KEN CASTLE: Neglected to mention: my smart boys reversed that hack those fellas worked for you - easy breezy, once we had access to their drives.
KEN CASTLE: ( on SCREEN ) Come on, lets boogie woogie rock and roll.
SIMON: CUT BACK TO:
KEN CASTLE: Biggest, baddest Slayer in the game. don't seem like much, does Lucky shot. OK, not really. I need an audience, boys.
KABLE: ( desperate ) Just like last time. Remember? WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 You're stronger now. a little more fight in you. but I think the end result will be about the ( freaked ) What the hell was that?
KEN CASTLE: Just like last time. Remember? You're stronger now. a little more fight in you. but I think the end result will be about the What the hell was that?
PONYTAIL GEEK: There are 2 networks accessing the same IP address.
GEEK LEADER: Someone on the outside is sending him commands.
KEN CASTLE: ( panicking )
RETARDS!: ( irritated ) Working on it.
