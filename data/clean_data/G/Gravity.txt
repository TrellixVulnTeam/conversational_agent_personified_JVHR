CARD 1: AT 600 KM ABOVE PLANET EARTH THE TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATES BETWEEN 120 AND -100 DEGREES CELSIUS. THERE IS NOTHING TO CARRY SOUND, NO OXYGEN, AND NO AIR PRESSURE. LIFE HERE IS IMPOSSIBLE. OUTER SPACE, 600 KILOMETERS ABOVE- PLANET EARTH. Like all images of Earth seen from space, this image of our planet is mythical and majestic. The globe seems almost tangible, slowly spinning, floating in the endless void of space. It is a blue planet, and bright white clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents: green, yellow and brown. It is noon in Cape Town and early night in India. The sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened sliver on its Eastern edge. It is beautiful! And so full of life. But not here. Here it is completely silent.

ASTRONAUT: Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.
MISSION CONTROL: Please expand.
MATT: Okay, let me tell you a story. It was '96. I'd been up here 42 days. Every time I passed over Texas, I'd look down, knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky, was looking up, thinking of me. Six weeks I'm blowing kisses to that woman. Then we land at Edwards and I find out she'd run off with a lawyer before I was off the launch pad, so I packed my car and I headed to.
MISSION CONTROL: Tijuana. You've told this story, Kowalsky. As Houston recalls, she took off in your '74 GTO. Engineering requests fuel status on the jet pack Matt smiles, checks the monitors of the sleek device strapped to his back.
MATT: Five hours off the reservation and I show 30% drain. My compliments to Engineering. Except for a slight malfunction on the nulling of the roll axis, this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust.
MISSION CONTROL: ( ON RADIO )
MATT: Tell them I still prefer my '67 Corvette though. Speaking of which did I ever tell you the
MISSION CONTROL: ( ON RADIO )
MATT: Even Engineering?
MISSION CONTROL: Especially engineering. We're going to miss you, Matt. Matt grins, fiddles with a control and propels himself away from the Shuttle. Stationed around the telescope are TWO ASTRONAUTS carrying out a repair mission. They are also wearing space suits but unlike Matt, they are not wearing Manned Maneuvering Units. SAFETY TETHERS are the only things stopping them from floating away into space.
RYAN: Comm card reboot in progress.
MISSION CONTROL: ( ON RADIO )
SHARIFF: Nearly there. Replacing battery module A1 and C. SHARIFF DASARI is an Indian engineer in his mid-thirties. He is attached with tethers to a platform on one side of the Hubble. This is his second mission into outer space.
MISSION CONTROL: ( ON RADIO ) MISSION CONTROL ( ON RADIO )
SHARIFF: No. no. no Houston, don't be anxious. Anxiety is not good for the heart. The system is ready to re- Hubble Telescope engaged. Upgrade fully functional. That applause you hear is for you, Shariff. Congratulations. Kick back, take the rest of the day off. Shariff cheers and begins singing a pop tune in Hindi, bursting into a Zero-G Bollywood choreography that is repressed by the stiffness of his space suit.

Matt is now approaching the Explorer, skillfully maneuvering his The other astronaut stands perched on a ROBOTIC ARM attached to the Shuttle. The arm is a crane-like moving platform remotely operated from inside the Shuttle. We TRACK In on the astronaut as she works intently alone.
MISSION CONTROL: Dr. Stone. Houston. Medical now have you with a temperature drop to 35.9 and heart rate rise to 70. How are you doing?
RYAN: Houston, I'm fine, it's just.
MISSION CONTROL: Doctor Stone? Medical is asking if you want to return to Explorer? Ryan HUMS as she jiggles the CARD.
RYAN: No, we've been here for a week Houston, let's just finish this. RYAN STONE is a medical engineer, specialized in hospital scanning systems. She's focused on her work as though she's all alone in the world. This is her first mission. Ryan eyes the Card, then.
MISSION CONTROL: ( ON RADIO )
RYAN: Try again.
MISSION CONTROL: ( a beat, then. ) Still nothing.
RYAN: Houston, could you please turn that music off?
MISSION CONTROL: ( ON RADIO )
MATT: Not a problem. Matt toggles a switch and the music stops.
RYAN: Thank you, Kowalsky. Ryan moves the Card around.

RYAN: Assistance appreciated.
MISSION CONTROL: ( ON RADIO )
MATT: Thank you, Houston.
RYAN: Ryan begins unbolting. Matt lands right next to Ryan and grabs onto the telescope. She is frustrated, determined.
MATT: How are you feeling?
RYAN: Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble Matt takes out his pistol grip, and with fast precision puts its head to a bolt and begins unscrewing. Matt removes the bolt with confidence.
MATT: It's been a rough week. If it makes you feel any better, I puked up everything but my kidneys on my first Ryan is not as precise with her pistol grip, and when a bolt
RYAN: Whoa.! AWOL! The bolt spins floating away. She tries to grab it but MISSES, barely touching it but brushing it just enough to give it a push that makes it change direction.. She turns and reaches out to grab it, but she is strapped to the Robotic Arm. The bolt spins out into the emptiness of space when- A hand GRABS it before it has gone too far. It is Matt's. Ryan looks at him, embarrassed.
MATT: Hey you're the genius up here. I just drive this bus.
RYAN: Call me a genius if I can get this board initialized in the next hour.
MISSION CONTROL: Explorer, this is Houston.
EXPLORER CAP: Go ahead Houston.
MISSION CONTROL: NORAD reports a satellite has incurred a missile strike. The impact has created a cloud of debris orbiting at 20,000 miles per hour. Current debris orbit does not overlap with your trajectory. We'll keep you posted on any developments. Ryan glances at Matt.
RYAN: Should we be worried?
MATT: Let the boys down there worry for us.
RYAN: Explorer, engage arm and pivot to cargo bay.
EXPLORER CAP: ( ON RADIO )
MATT: So doc, now that you work for NASA, how do you like it?
SHARIFF: Kinda like winning the lottery, isn't She grins at the memory, glances at him. Confesses:
RYAN: I was just happy that they didn't cut the funding to my research.
MATT: How long was your training?
RYAN: Six months.
SHARIFF: Including holidays?
MATT: So, what is this scanning system?
SHARIFF: Nothing rad, it's just a new set of eyes to scan the universe.
RYAN: Assuming it works, it's just for hospital use. This one is a prototype.
EXPLORER CAP: Standby for marking.
MATT: Listen, they don't bankroll prototypes, even for your pretty blue She gives him a look.
RYAN: My eyes are brown. Matt stares at her, a faint smile on his face.
MATT: Right now your eyes are blood shut. She grins, looks away he got her. Then.
SHARIFF: Matt turns. Shariff raises his arms again.
MATT: ( for Ryan's benefit ) And to think he went to Harvard. Ryan doesn't react to this, too consumed as she is with the panel. Matt looks out. A sad smile is on his face.
RYAN: "Mmm?" So what do you like about being up here? She hesitates trying sincerely to articulate her feelings as we GAZE down at the silent planet below.
MATT: "Mmm?" So what do you like about being up here? She hesitates trying sincerely to articulate her feelings as we GAZE down at the silent planet below.
RYAN: The silence.
COMPLICATED: Hmmmm. Terrific. Ryan inspects a panel inside the telescope, studying it with a small mirror.
MATT: Hmmmm. Terrific. Ryan inspects a panel inside the telescope, studying it with a small mirror.
RYAN: Houston, from first inspection comms panel appears to be dead. Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary?
MISSION CONTROL: You're the expert, doctor. It's your Ryan takes out the small mirror and Matt stretches his arm, offering assistance, but- She does not want any help and puts the mirror away in her toolbox, leaving Matt with his arm outstretched. Ryan starts looking for another tool, but Matt is one move ahead of her, offering her a pair of tweezers. Ryan hesitates and takes the tool. She starts working on the Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.
MATT: Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.
MISSION CONTROL: Please elaborate.
MATT: It's the same feeling I had at Mardi Gras in 1987.? He waits, letting the moment hang knowingly. Then:
MISSION CONTROL: That is affirmative. Surprisingly, control hasn't heard the Mardi Gras story. Please proceed.
MATT: Well, it's day one and I'm bumping my way down Bourbon Street looking for the sister of a friend of mine. The streets are swimming with people, I'm thinking there's no way I'm finding this girl. Ryan rolls her eyes and mumbles to herself-
RYAN: Proceeding to over ride. Matt continues his story without missing a beat-
MATT: Then all of a sudden I look up and there she is.

MATT: Not one second. Now! Shut it down!
RYAN: Sorry. I'm sorry. It's done. The ROBOTIC ARM slowly withdraws, carrying Ryan back towards the Matt watches her go, then:
EXPLORER CAP: ( ON RADIO )
MATT: Alright Shariff, let's do this.
SHARIFF: Shariff turns and heads toward the base of the telescope holding onto the hangar's handrails.
MATT: Houston. Update. Matt PROPELS himself to the base of the Hubble using the propelling unit on his back.
MISSION CONTROL: We have a full on chain reaction. It's been confirmed that it is the unintentional side effect of the Russians striking one of their own Shariff arrives to the base of the telescope.
SHARIFF: They shot down their own satellite?
MATT: Right of disposal. Most likely a spy sat gone bad. Now it's space junk. Matt grabs onto the base of the telescope-
EXPLORER CAP: ( ON RADIO )
MISSION CONTROL: Explorer, new data coming through. As it floats away, Matt gives the telescope a small spin.
MATT: What's the blowback, Houston?
MISSION CONTROL: It's not good. Most of our systems are going down. Debris chain reaction is out of control and rapidly expanding. Multiple sats are now down and they keep on falling. Matt eyes the arm as it slowly retracts, carrying Ryan back.
MATT: Define "multiple" sats.
MISSION CONTROL: Most of them. Telecomunications systems are gone. Expect a communication blackout at any moment.
RYAN: Kowalsky, visual of debris at nine Matt's eyes shift, watching a LARGE OBJECT, a piece of a BSE SATELLITE, spiral toward them.
MATT: Half of North America just lost their The sat glides by at tremendous speed.
MISSION CONTROL: You're a go for TH1138. Repeat You're a go for TH1138 procedure.
EXPLORER CAP: Copy that Houston.
MATT: Explorer, this is Kowalsky. Confirming visual contact with debris. Debris is from a BSE sat. To repeat
SHARIFF: Heads up!
MATT: To repeat I have- ANOTHER OBJECT, part of a WEATHER SATELLITE, hurls by them, a little bit closer than the previous one.
RYAN: Dr. Stone requesting faster, faster It is followed by a SMALL PIECE OF DEBRIS. It zooms by faster than the previous ones and hits the BSE SATELLITE. The satellite EXPLODES into hundreds of pieces and- A CHAIN REACTION takes place.
MATT: We have to go. Go, go! Go! The DEBRIS from the BSE satellite hits the WEATHER SATELLITE, and it EXPLODES, sending debris in all directions.
MISSION CONTROL: Attention. New data suggests immediate evacuation absolu. A high frequency of interference and-
RYAN: Dr. Stone requesting faster transport to the bay area. Explorer get me down.
MATT: Explorer permission to retrieve Dr. You are a go, Kowalsky. Matt thrusts himself over to Ryan.
EXPLORER CAP: ( ON RADIO )
MATT: Unstrap! You can't tune out the world up here. She reaches for the last clip and begins to undo it.
RYAN: I'm trying.
MATT: Try releasing the safety clip. Shariff makes his way back toward the airlock as- A PIECE of the debris HITS the Hubble's SOLAR PANELS, making a 12-inch HOLE in its golden surface. A piece of debris passes, nearly hitting them.
SHARIFF: Need some help there Matt?
MATT: No, don't wait for us. Get inside.
RYAN: It's stuck! Further back, another piece of debris collides with a bigger one. The two chunks of debris explode into a million pieces of shrapnel, one of which- HITS Shariff's helmet, breaking through the glass and hitting his head like an expansive bullet.
MATT: Man down! Man down! Matt PROPELS himself toward Shariff, who is floating away from the Shuttle unconscious.

RYAN: Ok. I'm trying! I can't it's stuck, Hold on. Ryan's hands are trembling and she can't get a grip on the hook.
MATT: Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone. Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone. As Matt's VOICE is LOST to STATIC, Ryan squeezes the hook and .gone, kicking herself AWAY from the robotic arm and FLYING FREE of the rotating arm. She catches a brief glimpse of the arm as it helicopters away, then loses sight of it as she rotates end over end in endless free fall. A PRIMAL SCREAM of God forsaken fear erupts from her lungs. The RADIO CRACKLES and Matt's VOICE returns.
RYAN: Yes. Yes. I copy. I'm detached! Ryan slowly spins, drifting into the empty darkness of space.
MATT: .Give me your position!
RYAN: I don't know. I don't know! I'm spinning. I can't. I can't.
MATT: Report your position. Tumbling end over end, Ryan fixes her gaze on her wrist. The effort makes her nauseous. She looks away.
RYAN: GPS is.down. I can't, it's down, I Give me a visual. Matt's faint voice is heard on the transmission under a lot of static. Ryan is panicking and begins to hyperventilate. Her eyes rake the dark sameness of her surroundings.

THE EARTH,: Very still and very distant. Night is creeping across the sphere as the sun sets, a sliver of light on the Western Hemisphere. A metallic object floating over the Earth is hit by a RAY of the sinking sun, and it gleams like a tiny star. Her eyes blink in recognition, gleaming with alertness. Her intellect engages and she gains a new sense of calm.
MATT: ( ON RADIO )

MATT: ( ON RADIO )
RYAN: Oh. Sorry. She slips the light back into her side pouch just as Matt appears as if from nowhere and GRABS HER.
MATT: Ryan holds on to Matt. Instantly, they begin to spin together. Matt takes out a tether.
RYAN: Ryan holds on to Matt. Instantly, they begin to spin together. Matt takes out a tether.
MATT: Now, I'm going to tether you to me. Ryan is paralyzed, holding onto Matt tightly and looking at him in fright. He stares back.
RYAN: Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, Ohh I got it. He runs the other end of the tether to the harness on Ryan's suit and attaches it.
MATT: Ok. So far so good. Now listen. I'm going to give you a little push, just so you're clear of the jets
RYAN: Sorry. Not a push, more like a nudge.
NO: Sorry. Not a push, more like a nudge.
MATT: Sorry. Not a push, more like a nudge.
RYAN: No. No. No. Wait. Don't. Matt places his hand on her breastplate and gives her a gentle nudge. Drifting again she begins to freak.
MATT: See? Where you go, I go. Matt ignites a new thrust to re-direct his position. As he does so Ryan's change of momentum makes him swing again.
RYAN: Ahh Dammit!
MATT: I know what you mean.
RYAN: Ahhh Dammit.
MATT: You're burning oxygen, we're going to go back to the shuttle. How's that for a plan. Copy?
RYAN: Right copy that. As Matt accelerates toward a lower orbit, his momentum takes over, steadying Ryan's swing.
FUCK: Right copy that. As Matt accelerates toward a lower orbit, his momentum takes over, steadying Ryan's swing.
MATT: Right copy that. As Matt accelerates toward a lower orbit, his momentum takes over, steadying Ryan's swing.
RYAN: Why aren't they answering?
MATT: It seems like communications are lost.
RYAN: Can they hear us on an alternate We don't know. That's why we keep talking. If someone is listening they might just save your life. Set your watch for ninety minutes. Matt reaches for a digital watch strapped to his wrist and sets up the timer for- 90 MINUTES.
MATT: We don't know. That's why we keep talking. If someone is listening they might just save your life. Set your watch for ninety minutes. Matt reaches for a digital watch strapped to his wrist and sets up the timer for- 90 MINUTES.
RYAN: Why ninety?
MATT: Houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles per hour. Factoring in our current orbit, I reckon we've got 90 minutes before we play duck and cover again. Ryan sets her watch, studies the counter as it begins to count 02 down to six percent. As they travel, the Shuttle begins to take form.
RYAN: 02 down to six percent. As they travel, the Shuttle begins to take form.
MATT: Okay. Pretty scary shit being untethered up here, isn't it?
RYAN: Yeah. Pretty scary shit.
MATT: ( after a beat ) You did all right. ( to the Shuttle ) Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalsky. Our current location is approximately 900 meters out from the Explorer. Dr. Stone and I would like to retrieve the body of Mission Specialist Shariff and return it to Shuttle. Am I a go to retrieve? Roger that. Matt changes direction and approaches Shariff. He has to ignite several small thrusts to try and steady his direction, fighting against Ryan's momentum.
RYAN: Where is he? Where is he? Shariff's body is tethered to a PANEL that was ripped away from the Explorer. Matt approaches the panel and ignites the thrusters to slow down his course, and- He grabs onto it. Ryan, continuing her momentum, crashes against Shariff's body. The contact slows her trajectory, but it throws Shariff away, his tether tensing, pulling the panel with him.
MATT: Grab him!
RYAN: I'm trying. I'm trying.
MATT: Quick. You're pulling me away.
RYAN: I got him. I got him. Matt tries to ignite a very long thrust in the direction of the Shuttle, but this is difficult as the momentum of the other two bodies pulls him in all directions.
MATT: Clutch him like he's your Valentine. I can't gauge my thrust with you two yo- yoing around. Tentatively Ryan extends her right hand to grab onto Shariff's body harness. And she sees- Shariff's broken helmet. A hole the size of a soft ball pierces through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody mess. Ryan's face is inscrutable. Finally she looks away, but this time something arrests her gaze: A LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH floats next to Shariff, tethered to his suit via a small chain. In it, a YOUNG BOY LAUGHS with abandon, happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his TWO STRONG ARMS. Transfixed, Ryan is unable to look away, something complicated confusing her eyes. The photograph floats in the empty space above Planet Earth.
MATT: ( under his breath ) The Shuttle has suffered devastating damage. The tail is beyond repair, one wing is completely destroyed, while the other waffles weakly, nearly sheared from the fuselage.
RYAN: 02 down to five percent. Matt thrusts to slow down his trajectory and slowly bumps against the windshield of the COCKPIT. At the mercy of Matt's momentum, Ryan hits hard against the nose of the Shuttle, losing her grip on Shariff. As she caroms off, she grabs onto what is left of the cockpit's All right, here we go. Careful of the Matt takes his flashlight and looks through the broken windows, lighting the cockpit. Ryan pulls herself up and looks-
MATT: All right, here we go. Careful of the Matt takes his flashlight and looks through the broken windows, lighting the cockpit. Ryan pulls herself up and looks-
RYAN: I apologize for not complying. I should've stopped working as soon as you instructed me to.
MATT: We were going to be hit no matter what. There was nothing you could've done to change that. He begins to reach out, hesitates briefly, then lightly touches her shoulder.
RYAN: She turns, no elbows this time.
MATT: Alright. We have to get ourselves to the Space Station. There. Matt gestures vaguely to a bright dot in distance.
RYAN: Alright. After you. He gently pushes her into space. She slowly drifts away from the Explorer but is suddenly stopped by the safety tether. Matt ignites his propellers and, giving a couple of small thrusts, he combats Ryan's swing. And with a LONGER THRUST- He shoots forward, pulling Ryan behind him. The two astronauts push forward together, leaving behind the shell of the Shuttle and the remains of the Hubble.

MATT: We're getting there.
RYAN: The sunrise. That's what I'm going to miss the most. But Ryan is not into the view right now. She's stricken with fear. Her jaw is clenched and her eyes are almost closed. Matt looks at the dark emptiness that engulfs him and smiles.

MATT: What would you be doing? She tries again. This time she forces herself and stares out at the Earth, which is over 500 kilometers below her.
RYAN: The radio. I listen to the radio.
MATT: There we go. Let me guess. NPR? Classical. Top for
RYAN: Anything. Doesn't matter. As long as they don't talk. I just drive. Her glassy eyes reveal a strong emotion growing inside of her, taking over her body. It is not fear, it is something deeper and more painful. Matt studies her curiously.
MATT: What do you miss down there? Ryan looks at the Earth. It never felt so far away. A long silence without an answer.
RYAN: Nobody special? Someone down there, looking up, thinking of you? Ryan closes her eyes. She remains silent. A silence that can't hide an unspeakable pain.
MATT: Nobody special? Someone down there, looking up, thinking of you? Ryan closes her eyes. She remains silent. A silence that can't hide an unspeakable pain.

MATT: What was her name?
RYAN: Sarah. She was four. Stupidest thing- a school trip to the swimming pool. She was playing tag- she slipped, hit her head, and that was it. She loved tag. I'm sure she was laughing. She looks away, toward Earth. It looks small. Remote.
MATT: Well, well, what d'you know. I have good news and bad news.
RYAN: The good news is we're five minutes from the ISS and I know where the Russians stash their vodka. and that's a good thing cus I'm running out of fumes. Bad news is I'm gonna be ten minutes short of..breaking Anatoly's record.

MATT: The tank may be empty but there's still oxygen in your suit, so sip, Ryan. Don't gulp. It's wine, not beer. Sip. We'll get you there. She nods.
RYAN: Shouldn't we be turning? We're
DRIFTING AGAIN: Sip, Ryan. Sip. Drifting is good. We want to drift. I wasn't kidding about those fumes. This can has one or two good thrusts left. If we're lucky.. They approach the Space Station, which is just ahead of them and a hundred meters below. She's sweating and starts to hyperventilate.
MATT: Sip, Ryan. Sip. Drifting is good. We want to drift. I wasn't kidding about those fumes. This can has one or two good thrusts left. If we're lucky.. They approach the Space Station, which is just ahead of them and a hundred meters below. She's sweating and starts to hyperventilate.
RYAN: Break. You have to break.
MATT: I can't. Can's empty. We're coming in fast and we're going to hit hard. Grab onto anything you can and hold tight! Just then Ryan CRASHES against the SOLAR PANEL, but is unable to grab hold. As she tumbles past, the body of the Station looms. Matt misses the solar panels, and COLLIDES against the Station. As he begins to drift past, he reaches out and snares a railing. Ryan passes flying above him. The tether tenses, pulling Matt. The momentum is to great and he LETS GO of the railing. Ryan floats over the roof of the Space Station, trying to grab hold of the handles and rods that stick out of the modules, but she's floating too high. She's quickly reaching the end of the Station, there is only one handle left ahead, her last chance before floating away into the black void. She extends her arm and GRABS the handle tightly for dear life
RYAN: I got it. I got it.
MATT: Grab a hold. Grab anything. Ryan is drifting away from the Station. She sees the infinite black void ahead of her and-
RYAN: I've got you. I've got you The very tips of their fingers touch
MATT: Shit. shit.
RYAN: No. No. No. Don't you. No. Don't you. Don't. Don't. NO As the parachute tenses, she STOPS. The tether attached to Matt's suit passes two feet away from her
MATT: You have to let me go.
RYAN: What? No
MATT: You have to.
RYAN: Those ropes are too loose, I'm pulling you with me. You have to let me go or we both die
MATT: Those ropes are too loose, I'm pulling you with me. You have to let me go or we both die
RYAN: I'm not letting you go! We're fine. Her leg slides through the loose rope and she floats further out, being snagged at the last minute by a tether around her foot. ( We move from high-angle to low angle two shot ). As this
MATT: You're not going anywhere, you're not
RYAN: You're not going anywhere, you're not
GOING ANYWHERE: It's not up to you. Matt begins to unharness the tether.
MATT: It's not up to you. Matt begins to unharness the tether.
RYAN: Please don't do this. Matt has unhooked the tether and is holding it in his hand.
MATT: You're going to make it Ryan.
MATT: ( ON RADIO )
RYAN: My CO2 alarm went off. My CO2 alarm went off.
MATT: You need to board the station. Can you see the airlock? She turns, looking for the Station's Airlock.
MAT: Do you copy? ( P.O.V shot - beginning to blur )
RYAN: Yes. Yes. I see it. I see it.
MATT: ( ON RADIO )
RYAN: That's because you're breathing CO2 and you're losing consciousness. You need to board the Station. Her eyes flutter.
MATT: That's because you're breathing CO2 and you're losing consciousness. You need to board the Station. Her eyes flutter.
RYAN: The transmission becomes weaker, filled with STATIC.
MATT: ( ON RADIO )
RYAN: Sunday drive.?
MATT: ( ON RADIO )
RYAN: I've never flown a Shenzhou
MATT: ( ON RADIO )
RYAN: ( ON RADIO )

MATT: ( ON RADIO )
RYAN: Every time. I crashed the Simulator every time.
MATT: ( ON RADIO )
RYAN: I'm going to take the Soyuz and come get you.
MATT: No you're not. . I have too much of a head start. That ship already sailed.
RYAN: No. I'm coming to get you.
MATT: Ryan, you're going to have to learn to let go.
RYAN: But. I.
MATT: ( ON RADIO )
RYAN: I'm. I'm going to make it.
MATT: Alright. Keep going Ryan stares at Matt's tiny figure in the distance.
RYAN: Dad wanted a boy.
MATT: Are you close to the airlock?
RYAN: Not yet.
MATT: Keep going. Ryan continues to the Airlock.
RYAN: Well, people say I have beautiful blue You. you have beautiful. you have beautiful blue eyes.
MATT: Well, people say I have beautiful blue You. you have beautiful. you have beautiful blue eyes.
RYAN: You. you have beautiful. you have beautiful blue eyes.
MATT: I have brown eyes. that hurts. She looks at Matt's figure receding.
RYAN: ( ON RADIO )
MATT: ( ON RADIO )
RYAN: No. I'm coming to get you.
MATT: You know, Ryan is a nice name for a girl. Wow, you should see the sun on the Ganges. It's amazing. Ryan starts to respond, then falters, watching Matt's figure grow ever smaller. THE SAD CROONING of HANK WILLIAMS crackles through the dying ( in a daze ) Only static hisses.
RYAN: ( in a daze ) Only static hisses.
SILENCE: INSIDE THE HELMET- Ryan is dizzy, sweating, and having trouble focusing. She sees
RYAN: Come on, come on. She finds what she's looking for: a BAG OF WATER with a straw at one end. She unscrews the top and begins to drink from it. She DRINKS in long gulps, squeezing the bottle, trying to quench her thirst. DROPS FLOAT out of her mouth as the water overflows. They float around her face like perfect pearls of different She takes a pause from drinking to catch her breath. The water is cooling her down, but she still takes another long, thirsty gulp and empties the bag. She checks the count on the STOPWATCH- 14 minutes and counting She takes a new bag of water from the drawer, and pushing herself off of a wall, she dives into the-
RYAN: Matt. This is Ryan. Copy? She waits.
RYAN: OK. where was it?. where was it? She moves her finger across the different buttons, searching.
RYAN: I engaged manual control- R O A K and RYD are activated. She grabs the joysticks with her hand, and-
RYAN: Oh, no. No, no, no. She presses the joystick.
RYAN: Great. Fantastic. Perfect.
SILENCE: The Station hovers below the Soyuz like a large whale swimming beneath a tiny lifeboat. The HATCH of the Soyuz OPENS. Ryan comes out of the craft into space. She's wearing the space suit she packed and she carries a large bag. She holds onto handles as she floats, SAFELY TETHERED to the inside of the cabin. She LOOKS around- The International Space Station is a looming presence floating ten meters below. It is pulling the Soyuz by its parachute. An ALARM on her STOPWATCH RINGS. It's been 85 MINUTES. She turns the alarm off and looks around.
RYAN: Clear skies but with a chance of satellite debris. SHE HUMS A SONG, the tune is reminiscent of the Hank Williams Melody that Matt had played earlier. She begins to climb around the vessel. With plenty of oxygen in her pressurized suit, this is not a difficult task. She pulls herself from handle to handle, making her way around the Soyuz and reaching-
RYAN: Shut up! She presses different buttons, and with each a voice of the alarm symphony dies until they are completely silent.
RYAN: Nothing. The thruster won't ignite.
RYAN: Come on. Come on!
RYAN: You gotta be kidding me. She taps on the frozen dial once more, as if trying to get the needle to go back up, and once again-
FU: OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH. Inside the capsule, through the portal, Ryan hits and hits, bouncing around the confined space of the cabin and venting all her anger, until she herself is out of fuel. She grabs the radio and-
RYAN: This is Dr Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy?
RYAN: Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? She turns her neck stiffly, looks at the- TEMPERATURE DIAL, -8 degrees and dropping. Through the PORTHOLE the SUN drops. DARKNESS descends. Finally, a SOUND SURFACES through the static:
TRANSMISSION: Han. ni. ts. She turns the dial slowly, clinging desperately to the wavering thread of communication.
RYAN: Repeat. This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone from STS-157. Do you copy? Words BURST FORTH, ringing clear as a bell for a moment.
TRANSMISSION: Hannik ya itc. pini. Ryan blinks. The transmission is not in English.
RYAN: Is this the Chinese Station? Is this Tiangong? Copy? As she tunes in a faint voice is distinguished. It doesn't appear to be in Chinese either.
TRANSMISSION: Hannic ya itcitem pini!
RYAN: S.O.S. Do you understand?
TRANSMISSION: Uumaruq taigaa!
RYAN: Mayday! Can you copy? Mayday! Mayday! The voice on the transmission appears to be a man in a very jovial mood. He keeps laughing.
TRANSMISSION: Yes! Mayday! Mayday!
RYAN: Yes! Mayday! Mayday!
TRANSMISSION: Mayday! Aningang!
RYAN: Mayday, Aningang! Aningang, Mayday! The HOARSE LAUGHING of an MAN rises through the STATIC.
TRANSMISSION: Mayday, Aningang! Aningang, Mayday! The HOARSE LAUGHING of an MAN rises through the STATIC.
RYAN: ( TO HERSELF )
TRANSMISSION: Aningang! Mayday! Suli, suli! She starts to speak again but the glimmer of hope fades from her face with the realization that this man does not understand her No, Mayday's not my name. I'm Stone, Dr. Ryan Stone I need help.
RYAN: No, Mayday's not my name. I'm Stone, Dr. Ryan Stone I need help.
TRANSMISSION: Mayday! Ieukpalliktuq uumaruq taigaa A noise in the background makes Ryan smile.
RYAN: ( SOFTLY ) ( INTO HEADSET )
TRANSMISSION: Ieukpalliktuq naabuqtuq.
RYAN: Is it beautiful where you are? Here it's colder than hell and lonelier than shit, but it's beautiful Aningang. Utterly, terrifyingly Through THE PORTHOLE- Even under the darkness of night, it is possible to see the glaciers spreading over the green forests. It all looks so fresh and full of life.
TRANSMISSION: Suli aasrivak aatqatik niuruq.?
RYAN: Dogs! Woof. Woof. Woof. She makes barking noises. The man begins to laugh and barks back at her.
TRANSMISSION: Auuu. Auuu. Oipmiq. Oipmiq! Auuu. Ryan and Aningang bark in unison.
RYAN: Woof. Woof.
TRANSMISSION: Auuu. Auuu.
RYAN: I'm going to die, Aningang. The SIGNAL ebbs, losing its battle with the STATIC.
TRANSMISSION: Ieukpalliktuq upatimi.
RYAN: You are singing to your baby? Is that a lullaby? That's so sweet! Ryan is transfixed, listening to the gentle gurgle of the baby as Aningang coos to it, then begins to SING again.
MATT: Ahhhh! Alright, check your watch. 13 hours, 11 minutes. Call Anatoly, tell him he's been bumped. The figure glances around.
RYAN: How did you?
MATT: Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
RYAN: But how did you? He reaches out and effortlessly flicks a myriad array of switches. Instantly, the alarms go silent.
MATT: That's better.
RYAN: Ryan looks at him wide eyed, wanting to know how-
MATT: I found a little extra battery power. I'm just happy you're still alive. To be honest, I thought your chances were slim to none. By the way, did you find the vodka?
RYAN: You never told me where. Matt fishes a SMALL FLASK from under his seat, spins off the Oh well. To Anatoly! Na zdorovje. .and takes a big gulp. He offers the flask to Ryan, who appears to be dozing off. She blinks, shakes her head.
MATT: Oh well. To Anatoly! Na zdorovje. .and takes a big gulp. He offers the flask to Ryan, who appears to be dozing off. She blinks, shakes her head.
RYAN: He studies her.
MATT: No? Right, let's get out of here. He looks at the monitors, where the Chinese Station is seen.
RYAN: We can't.
MATT: Course we can.
RYAN: There's no fuel. I tried everything.
MATT: Well, there's always something we can I tried everything.
RYAN: I tried everything.
MATT: Did you try the soft landing jets?
RYAN: They're for landing so.
MATT: Well landing is launching it's the same thing, didn't you learn about that in training?
RYAN: I never got to land the simulator, I told you.
MATT: But you know about it.
RYAN: And I crashed it every time. Ryan is falling asleep. Matt studies her as she dozes off.
MATT: Listen you want to go back or do you want to stay here? I get it, it's nice up here, you can just shut down all the systems turn out all the lights, and just close your eyes and tune out Matt starts flipping through buttons on the console, turning the cabin lights off.
RYAN: How did you get here?
MATT: Ryan, you have to learn to let go . Ryan is almost sound asleep.
RYAN: Ryan is asleep.
MATT: It's time to go home. Her eyes snap open. Her gaze shifts. The flask is floating in front of her. But no Matt. She turns. THE CABIN IS EMPTY. She turns back.
RYAN: Landing, landing. Landing is With a new surge of determination she TURNS ON THE CABIN LIGHT. She pulls the HELMET floating above her and puts it on. She connects the umbilical to her suit, opens the Oxygen Valve, and begins to breath. As the Oxygen flows back into her brain a new surge of determination brightens her face. She opens the valves of the other two umbilicals, allowing Oxygen to flow, pressurizing the cabin. She grabs the MANUAL.
RYAN: Okay Houston, here comes the tricky part, the Soyuz has to think we're only three meters above the earth. A pause, and then-
RYAN: Wow. you were right Matt. it's She then turns to-
RYAN: The pain is excruciating, but she grabs onto the panel's rod,
AND: Her finger hesitates as she takes a wild guess.
LOOP: She's in pain and more tired than ever now, and she's punchy.
RYAN: Come on. Come on. And when the RED GLOW turns to ORANGE- Ryan UNLOCKS her helmet and, using only her left hand, struggles to take it off. As the helmet floats, bouncing off of the cabin walls, Ryan massages her injured shoulder. She does this gently, as even the smallest pressure inflicts pain. The orange light is turning green when- She feels the Station quake fiercely, reverberating through the handle she's holding onto.
LOOP: She enters the hatch into the-
RYAN: THE PORTHOLE-
RYAN: In the Soyuz the power button is She passes her finger over the board, trying to make sense of the buttons.
SHE PRESSES: An ALARM RINGS, and under the ongoing LOOP, a RECORDING, clearly She glances around frantically, turns it off. It's shaking very intensely but she's wide-eyed now, clearly close to being beside herself.
RECORDING: Ok. That doesn't sound good.. She glances around frantically, turns it off. It's shaking very intensely but she's wide-eyed now, clearly close to being beside herself.
RYAN: Ok. That doesn't sound good.. She glances around frantically, turns it off. It's shaking very intensely but she's wide-eyed now, clearly close to being beside herself.
POSSIBLE OUTCOMES: Ryan keeps her eyes fixed on the countdown. Raises her voice to compete with the rising chaos.
RYAN: GRAVITY is still minimal, but the force of the inertia is rough and it jerks her around. She sees- A RED LEVER above her, but she can only reach it with her bad SHE GRABS THE LEVER- AND PULLS IT. OUTER SPACE. THE LOCKS DISENGAGE- THE CABIN separates from the rest of the vessel and from the Station. It spins away, plummeting toward the atmosphere. The two fragments of the Tiangong follow, spinning in a rage of sparks and fire.
SHE STRETCHES: RYAN ( CONT'D )
UNDERWATER: The metallic capsule, which weighs almost three tons, sinks quickly into the lake. As the ropes of the parachute tense, the long fabric follows the cabin down.
RYAN: Almost primal, like the first breath of a newborn child, it burns her lungs but reclaims life. She only has enough strength to keep her face above water. She FLOATS, catching her breath and taking long gulps of air. She looks up at-
AAAHHHHHH!: Almost primal, like the first breath of a newborn child, it burns her lungs but reclaims life. She only has enough strength to keep her face above water. She FLOATS, catching her breath and taking long gulps of air. She looks up at-
RYAN: Thank you. She PLANTS HER PALMS against the ground and- With an effort, she pushes herself up. SHE FEELS HER WEIGHT, and manages to rise to her hands and knees like a four-legged mammal. And she STANDS UP. ONE FOOT FALLS heavily on the ground. It sinks into the mud and
