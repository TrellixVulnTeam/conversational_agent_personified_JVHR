VALLON: He hands the boy a dark red velvet pouch. Very carefully, the boy, known as AMSTERDAM, wraps the razor up, hands it back to his father. From the shadows, VALLON now raises a long pole with a beautiful golden crucifix mounted on the end, then holds his free hand out to his son. Amsterdam squeezes tight. VALLON nods toward the door. Amsterdam pulls it open. Outside is a dim hallway. We hear SOUNDS that might be animal or human. MUSIC begins: a steady, driving cadence somewhere between a march and a CUT TO 2 INT. HALLWAY VALLON strides in long measured steps. Amsterdam has trouble keeping up with him. They are walking down a long corridor that's like a tunnel. Patches of LIGHT stain the darkness. Sometimes Amsterdam glimpses a FACE peering out from the gloom. Once or twice he almost stumbles over a BODY stretched across his path.

Patches of LIGHT stain the darkness. Sometimes Amsterdam glimpses a FACE peering out from the gloom. Once or twice he almost stumbles over a BODY stretched across his path.
CUT TO: 3 INT. ROOM Another room, even smaller. The only decoration is a bizarre rendering of a Madonna and child painted on the wall. A beefy man picks up a home-made PIKE, its iron tip sharpened to a lethal point. He is smiling. The grin is huge, but cockeyed. It occupies only half of his face. The grotesque, unending grin is the result of facial paralysis, and has given him a nickname: HAPPY JACK MULRANEY. Jack lifts the pike carefully, then takes a candle from the wall and bends down over a wooden cage full of rabbits. He slowly moves the candle back and forth across the cage top. Wax falls on the cage, splattering an unlucky rabbit. Jack thrusts the pike between the wooden bars, impaling the rabbit's body. He pulls the pike from the cage and leaves.
CUT TO: 4 INT. HALLWAY Jack falls into step beside VALLON and Amsterdam. He holds the pike with the dead rabbit high, next to VALLON's cross.
HAPPY JACK: Now a WOMAN joins them. She's dressed in man's clothes, her pants held up by suspenders. She wears a set of IRON CLAWS. MUSIC builds, growing more insistent and more ominous. Now a figure looms before them. Over his street clothes, this WARRIOR wears a rig of home-made armor made from fracgments of steel, lengths of chain and bits of leather. He carries a battle-axe as lightly as if it were a twig.

He carries a battle-axe as lightly as if it were a twig.
RABBIT WARRIOR: He joins the procession. Another woman, as tough as the first and half again as large, and several more men, all armed with implements of destruction, fall in beside him. Their faces are marked with blood, like Vallan's, or covered with ritual markings made with paint and ink. The group grows ever larger and more forbidding. occasionally PEOPLE dart around them in the tunnel and scamper out of their way like animals frightened in a burrow.
CUT TO: 5 INT. ROOM Vast and dank, like a cavern. We start CLOSE on. . the body of a dead rat being filled with some pieces of lead. Then a little WIDER to reveal: an eager boy, SHANG DRAPER, about the same age as Amsterdam. He drops the last few pieces of lead into the mouth of the rat, then sews it closed. He hefts the animal by the tail, swinging it as he stands up. He is near a primitive forge where a half-drunk SLACKSMITH hammers crude weapons into shape and distributes them to OTHER MEN and WOMEN. The floor is covered with bits of lead and steel, which Shang has been using to sew into his rat. Shang FOLLOWS the crowd of men and women with their weapons. And now we see this room full. It is huge: the main room of the Old Brewery, crowded with families huddled together for warmth and comfort, or out of fear; men and women, together or separately, drunk or passed out. They are like zoo animals in a pit. There are sticks of furniture jammed in corners, or, more often, arranged at angles in the middle of the room to form tiny enclaves where the ancient brewery machinery forms irregular boundaries. Above Shang's head, VALLON and his gang walk across a plank bridge that spans the room a hundred feet beneath them. Armed men and women from the Brewery are climbing a rope ladder to join them. Shang SCURRIES up after The men and women from the Brewery fall in behind VALLON and the others in the lead. Shang SPOTS someone near his own age toward the front: Amsterdam. He presses through the crowd like a hunting dog.
SHANG: be settled today.
AMSTERDAM: be settled today.
SHANG: What do you think?
AMSTERDAM: What do you think?
SHANG: CUT TO 6 INT. HALLWAY The group now turns down the last corridor, as dim and long as a tunnel. In the distance, there's a faint glimmer of light and the figure of a MAN ( MONK EASTMAN ). VALLON stops near the door.
CUT TO: 6 INT. HALLWAY The group now turns down the last corridor, as dim and long as a tunnel. In the distance, there's a faint glimmer of light and the figure of a MAN ( MONK EASTMAN ). VALLON stops near the door.
VALLON: I don't know you.
MAN: I suppose there's to be a fight. VALLON catches the heavy Celtic inflection in the man's voice.
VALLON: not quite a Native American myself.
MAN: not quite a Native American myself.
VALLON: not quite a Native American myself.
MONK: not quite a Native American myself.

MONK: not quite a Native American myself.
VALLON: Monk turns to the door with the grace of a dancer and delivers a SHATTERING kick, sending it flying off its hinges. Clear white LIGHT streams in, and we see Monk Eastman plain for the first time: a huge man, in stature and girth, wearing a small DERBY that intentionally makes his head look even bigger.

VALLON: Stand with us then.
CUT TO: 7 EXT. STREET DAY ( WINTER ) WINTER WIND blows across a scene as strange and bleak as an alien planet. VALLON, carrying his cross high, steps through the doorway. The OTHERS slowly follow VALLON out of the building, which is three stories high and maybe a block long. A dilapidated sign identifies it as the 5 Paints It is the tallest structure in the midst of low, squalid SHACKS, winding ALLEYS as narrow as a snakels back, and DIRT STREETS filled with ruts, mud and filthy snow. A few PIGS wander forlornly about, rooting for garbage. WASH hangs stiff, in the middle of the square, from a peculiar monument erected to some forgotten war hero. The Brewery occupies one side of a SQUARE surrounded by some storefronts and a couple of collapsed wooden sidewalks. If this place resembles anything at all, it's a horrible hybrid of London's Limehouse and a pioneer town in the American West whose best days have long passedor never came at all. VALLON stands still, staring across the square past the monument. His battalion of irregulars waits for his signal. Now. very, very slowly.from around both sides of the monument comes ANOTHER GANG, in size the same as VALLON's, men and women both, armed like Visigoths with HOMEMADE WEAPONS: knives, pitchforks, building blocks and bricks, boards with sharp nails protruding from the ends. Every member of this second group is dressed in a long DUSTER which reaches to the ankles. Several MEN in front of the group sport dusters made of leather.
VALLON: A MAN in a leather duster ( BILL THE BUTCHER ) steps forward. He is young, lean and fierce. And then there are his eyes. They do not match. One is real. The other is a huge, bulging PEARL upon which has been engraved, instead of a pupil, a full-color portrait of the AMERICAN EAGLE. On the side of the square, arranged to get a good view of the impending combat, is a group of STREET KIDS, girls and boys, none older than eight. They talk and laugh excitedly among themselves, picking their own favorites among the gangs as if the warriors were players on a team.
VALLON: BILL THE BUTCHER warriors who have gone before us. Valor is avid for glory, and glory is in our wounds.
VALLON: you see it clear with your single eye?
VALLON: BILL THE BUTCHER like a gladiator, and not look away? No honorable man turns an eye from his death.
VALLON: BILL THE BUTCHER BILL THE BUTCHER halt and maimed.
VALLON: BILL THE BUTCHER halt and maimed.
VALLON: BILL THE BUTCHER can smile out of both sides of his face. A pause of a single second. Then HAPPY JACK takes the dead rabbit off the tip of his pike and hurls it across the square. It lands right at BILL THE BUTCHER's feet. In a flash, BILL THE BUTCHER opens his coat. Inside, on a special belt he carries a CLEAVER, a CARVING KNIFE and other instruments of the butcherls trade, all stained with blood and gristle. Now the MAN standing next to him removes the broad BELT from around his coat. The brass buckle is sharpened to a point, the leather studded with glass. The gallery of Street Kids tenses for action: they are thrilled. VALLON reaches up to the CROSS, pulls off the top piece, to disclose, underneath, a gleaming sword point. He folds the arms of the cross down, like the blades of a jackknife.
VALLON: And the air is full of screams and battle cries as the two gangs hurl across Paradise Square into BATTLE. VALLON draws first blood. He impales a Native American on the sword end of his cross and turns to fight again. Amsterdam and Shang exchange a glance of frightened, worried wonder. Then a Native American rushes at them, shouting for blood. The boys act together. Amsterdam dives down in front of the man, sending him sprawling. Shang BLUDGEONS the fallen warrior, using his lead-filled rat like a blackjack as Amsterdam kicks him savagely; the Native collapses unconscicus at their feet. Before the boys can thank one another, however, they are separaten by the SURGING GANGS all around them. BILL THE BUTCHER leaves his meat CLEAVER imbedded in the middle of a man's skull, then WADES through the combat as if shielded by a charm. The gallery of Street Kids is thrilled by this display and reacts with
SHANG: I run with you! I'm one of you! Born a Native American from the blood of five generations!
VALLON: Amsterdam looks around. None of the Rabbits makes a move. This is clearly something he is meant to do himself. Amsterdam grabs the tortoise handle of the knife, PULLS on it. Vallon tries not to cry out. The knife does not move. Amsterdam tries again. He can't budge the knife. Vallon MOANS. Nearly wild, Amsterdam PULLS with all his strength. Vallon SCREAMS in agony. Amsterdam is pulling so hard he raises his father's back four inches off the ground. Still the knife will not move. Vallon passes out from the pain. Now, finally, someone steps forward: Monk Eastman. He leans over but Amsterdam, berserk with grief, pushes him away, turns back to his father, and, with a last desperate pull, DRAWS the knife from his father's heart. He throws it on the ground. Monk picks it up, wipes the blade on his arm, closes the knife and hands it to Amsterdam.
MONK: Now Monk leans over the lifeless body and reaches inside Vallon's coat, REMOVING some money.
MONK: He tries to shove Monk away from his father, when the Native Warrior HAPPY JACK Amsterdam, wild with shock and grief, turns back to his father as Monk takes what's owed him. Amsterdam bends over to KISS Vallon on both cheeks, then on his left eye. The boy is just about to kiss his fatheros closed right eye when the lid springs OPEN - Amsterdam jumps back despite himself. Vallon stares at him: a last moment of recognition.

RABBIT WARRIOR: HAPPY JACK And the RABBITS turn away, going back to the Old Brewery or vanishing down the narrow streets. Now a few CITIZENS venture out into Paradise square. A couple of SCAVENGERS scoot about, looting bodies. Amsterdam stays in the center of the square unmoving, undisturbed, keeping solitary vigil over his father. A TITLE is superimposed across this scene:

Although the night's cold, the streets are jammed. WHORES painted like carnival Gypsies sell themselves to any man sober enough to stand up. SOUNDS of laughter and combat filter out from garish SALOONS like the Little Naples, the Hell Hole, the Egyptian Hall. In the midst of all this highlife are BEGGARS and the SICKLY, looking for charity, scrounging garbage in the street. An INDIGENT battles a CRIPPLE for a meager scrap of faod. A richly dressed WOMAN, riding by in a carriage, hides her eyes by raising a HUGE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS in front of her face.

POLICEMAN: But there's places to put up a boy on his own. Three WOMEN, exquisitely costed, burst from the door of the Egyptian Hall. Under the harsh glare of a nearby gas lamp, their faces are no longer striking. Johnny STARES; there is something not right about these faces.
JOHNNY: We SEE one of the women's faces, suddenly harsh under gaslight: under thickly caked make-up is a smiling TRANSVESTITE.

A WOMAN bends down and kisses the body. Happy Jack Mulraney holds Vallon's crucifix, which he has obviously inherited. As a disreputable looking Minister mutters PRAYERS, Happy Jack whispers to a silent Amsterdam.

AMSTERDAM: CUT TO 16 EXT. STREET/PARADISE SQUARE DAY A grey day. Amsterdam stops in front of a window. He STRUGGLES with his scarf, trying to keep himself warm. His eye strays for a moment, and he sees he is outside Mr. Cornelius' Establishment. Then he NOTICES something .. his FATHER, propped up in a coffin, on public display. There is a large sign beside the body: "The Dead End of Lawlessness. Tammany Abhors Crime. Tammany Means Justice." A sizeable CROWD is goggling at the body. Amsterdam BULLS his way through the people to the street. He looks in the gutter, then looks up quickly. Someone is watching him: Johnny. He's carrying an armful of wood.

Dead Rabbits join up in a rough funeral procession. SEVERAL help LOAD Vallon's body back into the coffin and place it onto Mr. Cornelius' fancy funeral wagon. Monk Eastman LEAPS up onto the wagon and closes the coffin lid tight. There are PEDDLERS everywhere. One dispenses drinks from a portable samovar. A SAILOR hawks ships in a bottle, repeatedly shouting the same advertisement: "Encourage the work of a landswamped sailor!" A SILHOUETTE ARTIST offers to draw portraits of passersby. Funeral music is furnished by STREET MUSICIANS: a drummer, a fiddle player, and a horn player, with a couple of BUSKERS performing along side for good measure. Mr. Cornelius takes the wagon reins and guides the horses out of the square. The gang FOLLOWS solemnly behind. And across the square, the police wagon carrying Amsterdam starts MOVING OFF in the opposite direction. He keeps looking out the tiny wagon window. The funeral procession leaves the square and activity returns quickly to normal. Peddlers' CRIES once again fill the air. The Buskers start PLAYING a snappier tune. SNOW begins to fall.
CUT TO: 18 INT- TOMBS DAY A huge, awful prison building modeled on an Egyptian mausoleum. Amsterdamtrying to hide his growing fearwaits on line with other PRISONERS, all of them older than he. At the head of the line, prisoners are being processed by a JAILER and a couple of COPS. Each prisoner is asked several cursory questions, then told to strip. Every one of the men is SCARRED in some way. AMSTERDAM nears the front of the line. The MAN just ahead of him undresses. His left buttock is missing, and his back is covered with whip scars. A PRISONER behind Amsterdam WHISPERS loud enough for Amsterdam to ANSTERDAM steps up to the desk. The JAILER hardly takes notice of him.

Therels a long bar, where men and women stand three deep; lots of small tables; a dance floor; and a stage on which four blowsy DANCING GIRLS are giving out with a ribald number titled "My Father's Teeth Were Plugged With Zinc." One end of the bar is entirely taken up by a huge woaden keg with an attached hose. BAR ATTENDANTS DUMP the unfinished contents of glasses into the open barrel top as a line of FAR GONE DRUNKS wait their turn for the hose. Maggie, Jenny's mother, is close to the front of the line, very drunk, hanging on to a mush-faced HOODLUM. Two VISITORS watch. One has a pad and makes quick SKETCHES.

CUT TO: 20 INT. CREMORE BACK ROOM NIGHT Johnny RUSHES toward a wooden pen in the center of the room. There are cries from the crowd of SPORTSMEN of "Hurry it up" and "More speed!" Johnny dodges a kick or two before he finally arrives at the pen. He UPENDS the sack over the pit and a dozen live RATS tumble out. A GAMEMASTER slips Johnny a couple of cents as he starts his spiel.
GAMEMASTER: count to beat is ten rodents in three minutes. The crowd starts to place bets. A sleepy Johnny settles down close to ringside to watch the show. At a signal from the Gamemaster, a TRAINER tosses TOWSERA fierce mongrelinto the ring. The crowd cheers lustily, continuing to shout out bets, as the dog goes after the rats.The rats, fighting for their lives, bite the dog, attaching themselves to his body. Towser retaliates by gnawing the rats, SNAPPING them in half and spitting them out. As the CROWD cheers, and Towser kills, and money changes hands, Johnny curls up and goes to sleep.

CUT TO: 22 INT- MAIN ROOM/OLD BREWERY Jenny Everdeane and a girl FRIEND, her own age, huddle together in a dark corner of this huge space. The Friend opens her hand to show Jenny a glimpse of what she's clutching: a penny.

The Friend PLUNGES into one of the warren of TUNNELS that lead off the Brewery floor. CAMERA plunges through the darkness, after her. Her footsteps ECHO; there is the SOUND of stumbling, falling, an angry CURSE and a BLOW being struck. The FRIEND picks herself up out of the darkness and keeps running, CAMERA following down the dank halls. Suddenly the TRIO runs AHEAD of the camera. There is a SCREAM. CAMERA staps. And others SOUNDS follow quickly now: the dull THUD of a heavy object against bone, REPEATED several times; and then, very soon after, the most terrible sound of all: silence. Then Two Women emerge from the darkness of the tunnel, fighting over the penny. The Man, several steps behind them, throws an object to the dirt floor: it's a STONE, and it is covered with blood. He comes up behind the Two Women quickly and GRABS the penny from them with a hand that still DRIPS blood and gore. They CHASE after him across the crowded Brewery CUT TO 23 INT.

BOSS TWEED: Bill keeps walking.
BOSS TWEED: BILL THE BUTCHER You just stay out of my place.
BOSS TWEED: for a fiver. Bill waits for Tweed to continue. But Tweed stoops and tries to soothe a canary in a cage.

BOSS TWEED: give an appearance of probity.

BOSS TWEED: Bill looks at Tweed for a long moment. The he SHOVES himself away from the wall, pulls away the chair on which Tweed has been resting his feet and sits down close to him.
TWEED: TWEED places a bucket over the only fire plug in the vicinity, then sits on it.
ONLOOKER: TWEED places a bucket over the only fire plug in the vicinity, then sits on it.

TWEED: The SOUND of another bell, nearby. Down the street from the opposite direction come TWO MORE FIRE-WAGONS. The crowd starts cheering. Tweed does not move from the plug.
TWEED: their festivities. The wagons pull up next to the fire plug. Each of them has the words "Black Joke Fire Co." written large on the side, but the FIREMEN wear party costumes, not regular uniforms. Some are dressed as British Redcoats, still others as Indians. The FLAMES continue to devour the building, but Tweed does not budge from the plug. He is approached by the Black Jake chief, who is dressed as an Indian chief.
CHIEF: the province of the Americus company, and you will kindly keep your Impasse. The rival Fire Companies size each other up and start toward each other. The building continues to burn. Tweed remains regal and unperturbed atop the fire plug. As the two COMPANIES are about to close with each other, a second BELL sounds. Tweed's "reinforcements" have arrived: the Native Americans, led by Bill The Butcher. They PILE OFF the wagons before the horses halt. Now the Black Joke Co. is outnumbered, and it FALLS BACK. As the Crowd CHEERS, Tweed takes the bucket off the fire plug.

TWEED: The MEN of the Americus Co. give a great SHOUT and start firefighting: a hose is hitched up to the plug, buckets are filled, a primitive pump sends water spluttering everywhere. But there is not much blaze left to combat and the Men quickly grow frustrated. Tweed realizes this immediately.
TWEED: The men charge into a neighboring building, STOMPING down doors, CLIMBING through windows and SWINGING AXES with gusto, all to save a building that is in no danger at all. A local poll named DANIEL KILLORAN detaches himself from the crowd and approaches Tweed, giving him a hearty SLAP on the back.
KILLORAN: ( lowers his voice ) . to take enough to share. And not to steal so in the open. Indeed, the Men are leaving the building with lots of LOOT. CITIZENS who question their right to do this are promptly KNOCKED DOWN. Killoran GRABS Bill The Butcher as he rushes by.

Moving with jungle stealth and strength he . . BURSTS out the door within the massive frame of a great iron gate over which hangs the sign "High Bridge Orphan Asylum." He starts to RUN and a TITLE comes up.
CUT TO: 30 EXT. HIGH BRIDGE DUSK ( MATTE ) Amsterdam is on the bridge. But he does not slow up until .. . two orphanage GUARDS suddenly TACKLE him. A THIRD GUARD beats him with a billy club. Amsterdam moans and curses, as much from frustration as pain.
SECOND GUARD: The SECOND GUARD pulls AMSTERDAM up by the hair.
THIRD GUARD: Amsterdam won't give him the satisfaction. The Guard hits him. Amsterdam goes down, biting his lip so he won't cry out. Instead, he forces a SMILE.
SECOND GUARD: CUT TO 31 EXT. CORLEAPS' HOOK PIER NIGHT CROSSBONES, made of rags, fluttering from the mast of a leaky, unstable The bow of the small boat breaks the fog, and on board we see: a hulk called SHEENY MIKE KURTZ and a huge black kid named JIMMY SPOILS, manning the cars.

The HULL of a large boat suddenly laoms in front of them, not five yards I told you forget that sailor stuff! Which way's star. Too late. Their Ticket craft crashes into the side with enough force to make a LOUD THUMP and to send Shang sprawling.

SHEENY MIKE: Why don't we just knock on their front door? Shang gestures for QUIET. They wait and listen. No sound from the deck of the boat above them. The boys throw two ROPE LADDERS over the rail of the larger ship and start climbing.
CUT TO: 32 EXT. SHIP NIGHT The boys board the ship and gather on deck. They look around uneasily, spooked by the silence and the fog.
SHANG: Moving slowly, the boys FAN OUT and move toward the cabin at the far end of the deck. Johnny stays close to Shang, holding onto the shipls rail for Nothing. Looks picked clean. Johnny stops.

SHANG: Johnny freezes in terror.
SHANG: A long SHADOW falls across his shoulder. Shang jumps. Standing before him, holding a musket and covered in blood, is the ship's CAPTAIN. A BUTCHER'S CLEAVER is imbedded between his neck and shoulder. With his dying energy, the Captain takes AIM at a petrified Shang and fires his musket. Jimmy Spoils JUMPS the Captain from behind, sending the musket ball way wide. But the SOUND of the musket is thunderaus, and echoes through the harbor. The boys panic and head for the side.
SHEENY MIKE: Wait! Take him. If he's still alive he's good for ransom!
JOHNNY: Wait! Take him. If he's still alive he's good for ransom!
SHEENY MIKE: medical students. They'll go five dollars for it anyway.
JOHNNY: medical students. They'll go five dollars for it anyway.
SHANG: Shang and Johnny start DRAGGING the body. Pushing, pulling and mostly panicked, the others help. As they boost the body over the side, the SOUND of a bell cuts through the fog.
SHEENY MIKE: Shang shoves the body off the side and into the boat. It lands with a resounding THUD. The boys CLAMBER after it.
CUT TO: 33 EXT. BOAT/RIVER NIGHT PUSHING OFF with cars, tearing their rope ladders from the side of the ship, stumbling over the captain's body, the boys slip off into the fog.

SHANG: JIMMY SPOILS River pirates! Spoils settles back and tries to sleep. Johnny watches Shang in the bow. Shang is too agitated to notice Johnny's stare. He looks away, waiting for the sun.

He looks in the direction of the noise, SEES . . the BODY of the slaughtered ship's captain floating away in the company. He starts to cry out but Amsterdam GRABS him, locking his throat in the crook of his arm.

SHANG: SHEENY MIKE go against the Natives?
SHEENY MIKE: go against the Natives?
SHANG: Then we go.
JIMMY SPOILS: Amsterdam is sitting off to the side, watching this ongoing debate with contemptuous detachment. Johnny sits next to him.
AMSTERDAM: ( looks away ) Like her. His tone of voice has changed. Jenny Everdeane passes before him; she's ravishing. Amsterdam STARES, as if he's trying to see into her heart. Jenny pays him scant attention as she moves across the room toward Shang.

SHANG: He puts the scart in his coat pocket with a FLOURISH, then throws his arm about Jenny in a proprietary way.
SHANG: Jenny reacts slightly to the mention of the name: she looks over and RECOGNIZES Amsterdam now.
SHANG: than men, being morts.

SHANG: mort can turn out on her back.
AMSTERDAM: no place in this gang.
SHANG: no place in this gang.
AMSTERDAM: what you say. It's a mob. There's a tense hush in the grubby room. Shang takes his arm from around Jenny, wanting to be restrained.
JENNY: It's all your play now, Shang. Maybe you can set him right. Jenny hands him a cane. Barely managing to hide his reluctance, he startsslowlytoward Amsterdam, who stands his ground. The gang steps back to give them room in this tiny space. Shang pulls the cane apart: it's a SWORD CANE, but Amsterdam shows no fear. He shifts his weight a little, watching . and they're interrupted by a.

HAPPY JACK: It's the young Vallon, is it? I hardly recognized you.
AMSTERDAM: By now, Jack has taken not only the cocaine, and the money and swag Shang offers, but several of the purses and wallets Jenny delivered. Jenny stares at him with contempt, and he laughs, tossing one of the purses back at her.
JACK: Jack turns to leave but a BRASH BOY blocks his way. Moving fast and fancy, Jack bashes the Boy to the floor with his nightstick.
HAPPY JACK: Several of the gang make a move toward Jack, but Shang WAVES them back. Jack departs UNHARMED, to general disgust. Jenny walks back across the room to help the Brash Boy. Shang GLARES at Amsterdam, slides his sword back into his cane and follows Jenny, trying to explain himself.
AMSTERDAM: CUT TO 36 EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY A hot summer day. All the TRADESMEN are out in force, jamming the square and the side streets leading to it. Amsterdam walks fast through the crowd, enjoying the freedom and the bustle, as Johnny tags along close behind him.

Amsterdam looks carefully up and down the alley, letting his eyes adjust to the bright light. Ahead of him, he SEES . Shang Draper, in jovial conversation with a SECOND MAN we do not recognize. The man is bareheaded, and has a deep scar running back to front clear down the center of his bald head. Amsterdam waits, WATCHES. Shang takes the RED SILK SCARF he got from Jenny's swag and hands it to the Second Man. He and Shang SHAKE HANDS, as if they have concluded a business deal, and the Second Man walks away.

We must show them Tammany stands behind the letter of the law. We need to set an example.
TWEED: CUT TO 44 EXT- TOMBS DAY CAMERA moves high along the outside wall, past small rectangular slits that pass for jail windows. EYES peer out, as if a peep show is underway directly below in the Tombs courtyard. A PRISONER is being readied for the gallows by having a hood tied to his head. The CROWD is in a carnival mood; HOT CORN GIRLS, STREET VENDORS, "HOKEY-POKEY" ( i.e., ice cream ) MERCHANTS, even BUSKERS, all add to the holiday spirit. Jenny works through the crowd, pushing and smiling her way past groups of raucous merrymakers. She stops once or twice to have a word with a GENTLEMAN, flirts for a moment, then moves on. Further back in the crowd, Amsterdam NOTICES her. He watches her go through the crowd with an admiration that quickly turns to FASCINATION as he realizes what she's doing: picking pockets. The best bludget in the Five Points. He starts to FOLLOW her. Jenny has worked her way close to the hanging platform, but she's so intent on her job she has not noticed Amsterdam. The closer the platform, the closer the spectacle and richer the pickings: Jenny's concentration is absolute. On the platform, an ASSISTANT HANGMAN addresses the Crowd.

The closer the platform, the closer the spectacle and richer the pickings: Jenny's concentration is absolute. On the platform, an ASSISTANT HANGMAN addresses the Crowd.
ASSISTANT HANGMAN: 44 CONTINUED: Part of the Crowd PRESSES in toward the platform, temporarily blocking Amsterdam's view of Jenny. He is right against the platform.
ASSISTANT HANGMAN: containing a rather remarkable pocket silk.
HANGMAN: The Hangman is holding up the condemned man's coat which contains the RED SILK SCARF Amsterdam saw Shang give away. Amsterdam flips the HANGMAN a quarter, reaches out and GRABS the handkerchief.
AMSTERDAM: He stuffs it into his pocket and starts to PUSH his way through the crowd. On the platform, the WARDEN steps forward holding a primitive megaphone.
WARDEN: McGloin grunts from underneath the hood.
MCGLOIN: Crowd near the platform begins to CHANT "No hood, no hood, no hood!" The Warden puts his hand on the hood, starts to remove it. . and the Crowd CHEERS. Amsterdam turns, SEES: Charles McGloin. Bald, with a deep scar running front to back on his head. The very SAME MAN he saw in the alley with Shang. McGloin acknowledges the cheers of the crowd. The Warden holds to megaphone close and McGloin bellows.
MCGLOIN: The Crowd ROAR approval at these words. Amsterdam PUSHES through the crowd, looking for Jenny . SPOTTING her finally. . while up on the platform, the NOOSE is placed around McGLOIN's neck, and he is HOISTED UP in no time. We hear his neck SNAP. His feet kick after death. The Crowd raises a zighty cheer.
CUT TO: 45 EXT./INT. BROADWAY AND BROADWAY STAGE DAY Amsterdam walks with a crowd toward a waiting Broadway stage, a vehicle that looks like a horsedrawn train car. The stage will take spectators back uptown from the hanging. He is working his way toward Jenny, who is now BOARDING the stage. Amsterdam DASHES through the crowd and SQUEEZES onto the stage, which moves forward with a JOLT. Once on board, Amsterdam looks through the jammed car, SEES: Jenny, about to sit down - A MAN has offered her his seat. She smiles dazzlingly as she . and arranges her hands genteelly on her lap. The Man looks down on her and she smiles up at him again. He is bequiled. Amsterdam manages to get a little closer.
MAN: As this conversation continues, we watch-not only Jenny and The Man in conversation, and Amsterdam watching them; but we begin to notice what Amsterdam SEES. Although Jenny's hands apparently remain folded on her lap, her RIGHT HAND moves SLOWLY out from her wrap. toward The Man.
JENNY: As this conversation continues, we watch-not only Jenny and The Man in conversation, and Amsterdam watching them; but we begin to notice what Amsterdam SEES. Although Jenny's hands apparently remain folded on her lap, her RIGHT HAND moves SLOWLY out from her wrap. toward The Man.
MAN: . and BRUSHES past his jacket. He does not notice or feel a thing. Jenny's hand GLIDES past his THIGH . nearly brushing it . moving up across his pelvis and around his buttocks.
JENNY: .toward his pocket. The Man is in Jenny's thrall. He feels nothing and continues to have no idea what is going on. But Amsterdam KNOWS. Every silken, surreptitious move of her HAND across The Man's body is like a CARESS that Amsterdam can feel. Jenny's grace is balletic and EROTIC. As she picks The Man's pocket, she is, without knowing it, also seducing Her hand HOVERS above his pocket, waiting for the SWAY of the stage to match and mask her movement..

CUT TO: 46 EXT. ALLEY/BROADWAY DAY Jenny looks to make sure she has the alley to herself, then moves her body a little. . and her arms seem to come off. She has been wearing a set of ARTIFICIAL ARMS, hollow inside, which she can leave folded on her lap misleadingly while she goes about her pickpocketing. She's folding up the appliancecotton sewn over a soft form-when a VOICE behind her makes her turn.

CUT TO: 52 INT. SPAPROW'S CHINESE PAGODA NIGHT A low and lunatic place: a combination of an opium dream out of the Arabian Nights and a panel from a Bosch triptych. FAN-TAN games played by Orientals; WOMEN and CHILDREN of various colors suspended in cages from the ceiling as MEN and WOMEN in a secondfloor GALLERY point at them and JOKE. On the main floor, a long line waits for a shot at the barrel of All-Sorts. Jack charges in the front door, looks around.
JACK: All the NOISE subsides. Only the Fan-Tan game continues; nothing is so interesting that these Orientals will stop gambling. Now Amsterdam STEPS right in front of him. It's a grandstand play.
AMSTERDAM: Jack lunges ahead, swinging his NIGHT STICK. Amsterdam throws a chair across his path. Jack stumbles, goes down, dropping his night stick. Amsterdam grabs it, jumps on top of him, HITS him twice on the side of the head. There is a CRACKING SOUND. The PATRONS of the Pagoda gather round.

The SOUND of the place is a cacophony of SHOUTING, SINGING, GAMBLING and STRANGE MUSICwhich we can't identify at first. We START CLOSE on a huge ruby ring and we HEAR.
BOSS TWEED: ( V.O. ) . and WE MOVE OUT as a WELL-WISHER reads the Latin inscription.
TWEED: Mayor Wood.
WOOD: TWEED gives him a resounding slap on the back.
BOSS TWEED: We've got a motto.
WOOD: We've got a motto.
KILLORAN: We've got a motto.
BOSS TWEED: ( no one knows ) Well, hell, let's get one we can remember. We're going to build a new City hall, we better have something to put over the front door. And Mayor, you'll make sure the Latin's right? As Wood nods his assent, CAMERA MOVES across room. . past the gilded CAGES suspended ten feet over the floor, where the women and children look down at the action just below them with a mixture of trepidation and resignation. Occasionally a REVELER will jump up to try and GRAB one of the caged inhabitants. Still MOVING, CAMERA. . passes a stage, where we finally SEE the source of all the strange MUSIC we've been hearing: the music is provided by CHINESE MUSICIANS, a woman SINGER, a DANCER and some ACROBATS. They perform some weird, mangled Five Points version of Chinese opera. The music and performance continues as we MOVE PAST. . across a PEWTER FAN-TAN TABLE, where CHINESE GAMBLERS play with fierce animation and concentration. By comparison, the Occidental types playing beside them seem like tourists. Everyone SHOUTS and SCRAMBLES to place bets with the FAN-TAN DEALER. Above the Dealer is an oval opening in the ceiling, through which OTHER PLAYERS may watch the action below. These FAN-TAN PLAYERS lean over an elegantly carved rail, peering at the action on the table below, placing their bets and collecting their winnings by means of a BASKET attached to WIRES that whirrs constantly overhead. We continue to MOVE PAST. . until we are at the door of the place, where Amsterdam, Johnny and the Rabbits are having words with a BOUNCER.
BOUNCER: Come on, what are you saying? If you don't know us now, you'll know us tomorrow and you'll be working for us next week.
AMSTERDAM: Come on, what are you saying? If you don't know us now, you'll know us tomorrow and you'll be working for us next week.
JOHNNY: Daniel Killoran knows us.
BOUNCER: Tampen down, will you?
JOHNNY: Tampen down, will you?
AMSTERDAM: Tampen down, will you?
JOHNNY: Tampen down, will you?
BOUNCER: He SHOVES Johnny, who STUMBLES back into Amsterdam. They're both mad now, and they step forward together toward the Bouncer. . until Killoran intervenes.
KILLORAN: It's all right, Nat. They're saying the truth. They gave a good day's work for a good wage. Killoran HANDS OVER a paper-wrapped parcel of money, which Amsterdam takes the field.
KILLORAN: the field.
AMSTERDAM: the field.
KILLORAN: the field.
AMSTERDAM: Did you know this? Is this some scheme of yours?
KILLORAN: Did you know this? Is this some scheme of yours?
AMSTERDAM: Did you know this? Is this some scheme of yours?
JOHNNY: Points, as you might say. It's deemed an honor to work with him. Everyone knows Bill Poole, everyone fears him, everyone .
AMSTERDAM: Points, as you might say. It's deemed an honor to work with him. Everyone knows Bill Poole, everyone fears him, everyone .
KILLORAN: Points, as you might say. It's deemed an honor to work with him. Everyone knows Bill Poole, everyone fears him, everyone .
AMSTERDAM: any who calls him one of theirs.
KILLORAN: insult. I have no wish to rile you further, so if you'll allow me. He REACHES to take back the parcel of money, but Amsterdam BATS his hand to settle, you can do it any other time, any other place, I don't give a good dancing goddamn. But you do it here tonight and all the Five Points will be down on you like the righteous wrath of heaven. or you could, as the Book says, put away childish things. Join the celebration. Personally, I always find the least strenuous solution the most appealing. Don't you? Amsterdam stares at him as we.

CUT TO: 65 INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA As a CHINESE ACROBAT TWIRLS in the air, off the stage, and lands in the middle of the audience. The crowd is raucously appreciative as the Acrobat does GYMNASTIC MOVES among them. . past a table where the Dead Rabbits have settled. it is later in the evening, and everyone has been drinking. Amsterdam, sullen, intense, WATCHES . ..Bill the Butcher, across the room. He is like a prince regent. Everyone pays him court, including several uniformed COPS, TAMMANY HANGERS-ON, and NEWSPAPERMEN. Bill receives the attention as his due.. . while Amsterdam keeps watching, contempt and hatred gleaming in his eye. He pays attention to none of the gang around, including Jenny. Johnny takes advantage of the situation.
JOHNNY: at everything you did.
JENNY: at everything you did.
JOHNNY: at everything you did.
JENNY: Not to my thinking.
JOHNNY: Not to my thinking.
JENNY: Not to my thinking.
JOHNNY: Not to my thinking.
JENNY: Not to my thinking.
JOHNNY: Amsterdam. listen up, Amsterdam. Amsterdam glances over at them.
JENNY: You going with me or him? It's my thinking matters here. You don't have to ask him nothing.
AMSTERDAM: How's the evening passing?
JOHNNY: How's the evening passing?
AMSTERDAM: 'Cause it's treating me fine too. She gets up and starts toward the stairs to the second floor, Johnny following her, holding her hand. As they pass Amsterdam he LEANS toward Johnny pulls her away. As he watches her go through the crowd, Amsterdam's gaze falls on Bill the Butcher again. . and for the first tine their EYES MEET. Bill's eyes rest on Amsterdam, take him all in. but DON'T REMEMBER him. He looks away as a TAMMANY HACK steps up to pay court.. .. and a MASTER OF REVELS, center-floor, SHOUTS .

GROPER: BILL THE BUTCHER They do quite a bit more than that: they GRAB the Groper and KNOCK him to the floor. In the crowd, one SPECTATOR turns to his companion.
PAGODA SPECTATOR: The Groper CRIES OUT as the Natives PIN HIM to the floor, SPREADEAGLED. Bill has one weapon left. in a special pocket, inside his vest. It's his CLEAVER. He takes it out slowly, SAVORING the moment. The Pagoda goes QUIET. Only the gambling continues. The MUSIC dies. The only SOUND beside the noises of the Chinese at their fan-tan is the Groper, who HOLLERS for help as soon as he sees the cleaver. Bill HEFTS the cleaver in his hand, feels its weight, calculates timing, figures distance .. and starts THROWING it in the air. . CATCHING it by the handle . then throwing it again. higher, FASTER and HARDER with every toss.
AMSTERDAM: Bill turns, searching out the voice .
AMSTERDAM: And SEES Amsterdam, standing at his own table. His attitude is calm, smiling, respectful. But his eyes are demonic.
AMSTERDAM: BILL THE BUTCHER ( Bill nods his thanks ) Some great grand goddamned dance. ( Bill looks at him more closely ) You know me, sir.
AMSTERDAM: ( Bill nods his thanks ) Some great grand goddamned dance. ( Bill looks at him more closely ) You know me, sir.
AMSTERDAM: The laughter turns a little uneasy. Bill the Butcher sizes up the younger BILL THE BUTCHER BILL THE BUTCHER ( suddenly smiles ) shall we drink to it?
AMSTERDAM: BILL THE BUTCHER ( suddenly smiles ) shall we drink to it?
AMSTERDAM: ( they drink ) And to my other name. Vallon. Will you drink to that?
AMSTERDAM: they feed on, and what they shit's too good for you. DEAD QUIET. Absolute. Breathless. Only the Chinese Gamblers at their fan-tan ignore this confrontation.
AMSTERDAM: Amsterdam PULLS OUT the piratels knife which Bill the Butcher used to kill his father almost 12 years before.
JENNY: SHEENY MIKE That's the truth.
SHEENY MIKE: That's the truth.
JOHNNY: That's the truth.
JENNY: SHEENY MIKE Butcher in the first place. Jenny looks at him with contempt, then STARTS into the crowd. Johnny grabs her ARM but she pushes him off. On the floor, Bill uses the FLAT SIDE of the cleaver to SMACK the barely conscious Amsterdam on one side of his face. then on the other. REPEATEDLY. until Amsterdam is barely sensible. Bill grabs him by the hair. Amsterdam's body is slack.

MONK EASTMAN: BILL THE BUTCHER MONK EASTMKN young yet. Wait till he's aged for a proper kill.
MONK EASTMKN: young yet. Wait till he's aged for a proper kill.
MONK EASTMKN: . and he part SHOVES, part THROWS Bill back a good twenty feet.
MONK EASTMKN: The Dead Rabbits have scampered forward, and they're picking Amsterdam up off the floor. Monk looks at Jenny and Johnny, who each have Amsterdam by an arm.
MONK EASTMAN: BILL THE BUTCHER MONK EASTMAN This squares any debt. Get him out of here.
MONK EASTMAN: This squares any debt. Get him out of here.
MONK EASTMAN: And Bill comes forward, BRANDISHING his cleaver. Monk Eastman stands his ground, unmoving, untroubled. Everyone looks on in awe at this contest . . except Boss Tweed.
BOSS TWEED: If these two are going to combat, it aught to be a worthier occasion. And more rewarding for all. Tweed SIGNALS to Bill: STOP. The Butcher sees the signal but can't believe it. He SHAKES his head. His blood is up. He won't stop. Tweed SIGNALS AGAIN. Bill KEEPS COMING. Tweed signals Killoran, who STANDS himself. And, when he stands, every COP and TAMMANY LOYALIST in the placea hundred of them anywaySTAND behind Boss Tweed. As Bill keeps coming, and Monk stands easy, waiting. . the Natives and their ALLIES now stand, facing the Tammany crew. The Tammany backers, dressed flush and fancy, face the scruffier, more savage Five Points bunch: the twin factions of the criminal underworld, so different in style and so similar in purpose, SIZE EACH OTHER UP from opposite sides of the room. Bill STOPS. The odds are shifting, the stakes are climbing. Even the Chinese STOP GAMBLING. For the first time all evening the room is absolutely STILL. Even the Dead Rabbits have turned, at the door, to see what will happen. Tweed and the Butcher LOCK EYES: neither blinks. Then after a moment . a very long moment . a calm, bemused Tweed RAISES his glass.
BOSS TWEED: an equally bright future for us both. Another pause. Bill does not look placated. The whole place seems ready to . until Boss Tweed RISES to his feet, and RAISES his glass higher.
BOSS TWEED: Bill weighs the proposition. then looks to his men, NODS his head to call them off. He GRABS a glass off a table to join Tweed's toast. The MUSIC begins again. The gambling recommences. Patrons take their seats. The Dead Rabbits help Amsterdam out the door. Monk Eastman sidles up to Bill the Butcher.
MONK EASTMAN: He takes the Butcher's glass from his hand, raises it in salute, DRINKS DEEP and hands it back to him. At the door of the Pagoda, a badly beaten Ansterdam starts FLAILING and fighting by brute instinct. He HITS Jenny, and she goes down. Johnny grapples with him as Jenny PICKS HERSELF up and struggles to help SUBDUE She grabs Amsterdam's arm and, with Johnny's help, tries to HOIST him back to his feet.
JENNY: She grabs Amsterdam's arm and, with Johnny's help, tries to HOIST him back to his feet.
JOHNNY: She grabs Amsterdam's arm and, with Johnny's help, tries to HOIST him back to his feet.
JENNY: She grabs Amsterdam's arm and, with Johnny's help, tries to HOIST him back to his feet.
JENNY: Therels too damn little of him left to know anything. They start across Paradise Square, holding him up. . as the rest of the Dead Rabbits join to help them. all growing smaller in the distance against the primeval nighttime landscape of the Five Points. . and the Bouncer CLOSES the door.
DISSOLVE TO: 66 INT. DON WHISKERANDOS BARBER SHOP DAY Another DOOR OPENS, and Amsterdam stands on the threshold. A week or so has passed since the big night at Sparrow's Pagoda, but Amsterdam's face still shows the marks of Bill's beating. Don Whiskerandos is ministering to Monk Eastman with a straight razor, giving him a close and careful shave. Monk is thoroughly relaxed, doesn't even glance over when the door opens, hardly reacts when Don Whiskerandos says ..
DON WHISKERANDOS: MONK EASTMAN DON WHISKERANDOS MONK EASTMAN Indeed.- Can I buy you a shave?
MONK EASTMAN: DON WHISKERANDOS MONK EASTMAN Indeed.- Can I buy you a shave?

MONK EASTMAN: nothing from you and I can't earn nothing from you either.
AMSTERDAM: the Points.
MONK EASTMAN: MONK EASTMAN they got in their hands. ( beat ) Listen, son. take a word from a man who was honored to fight beside your father. Temper yourself like a sword, and pay attention to balance. Anger spoils an edge.

AMSTERDAM: Monk SIGHS and points to a huge WAR CLUB which hangs in a place of honor above the shop mirror. It has deep marks running along its front, like
MONK EASTMAN: cents. That's how much I got for my first kill. There are forty-eight more notches after it, and my fee has grown with each one. I can accommodate you alright, but you got to afford me. So do business with me or do it on your own.
AMSTERDAM: MONK EASTMAN Although I do hold money preferable to all. ( Amsterdam turns to leave ) But I'm sure we'll have news of each other.
MONK EASTMAN: Although I do hold money preferable to all. ( Amsterdam turns to leave ) But I'm sure we'll have news of each other.
AMSTERDAM: As he shuts the door of the shop, Monk Eastman gestures to Don Whiskerandos for another hot towel.
CUT TO: 67 EXT. STREETS OFF PARADISE SQUARE DAY A large wagon bearing a Tammany banner and carrying dozens of small sacks of coal moves slowly down the narrow street. Boss Tweed sits on the front seat, next to the driver, as his minions HAND him coal sacks. Tweed distributes them with a smile to the NEEDY who trot next to the wagon.
BOSS TWEED: Tammany's here to take the chill off the winter and the weight off your heart. It's Tammany can make this city a fit place, with the help and vote of all you good people. As he continues, Bill the Butcher JUMPS onto the wagon and sits down beside him. Boss Tweed hardly gives him a glance.
BOSS TWEED: BILL THE BUTCHER BOSS TWEED So I've observed.
BOSS TWEED: So I've observed.
BOSS TWEED: Consider the waste. Next time you're in a dust-up like that, think ahead and make proper plans. It'd be a grand source of revenue, whoever prevails.
BOSS TWEED: ( Bill's incredulous ) I want you to extend a proposition. I want him to join US.
BOSS TWEED: But he should throw in with the Native Americans, become aware of our Arrangement and . well, use his influence, shall we say, to enrich us BILL THE BUTCHER has been doing good and right? You think there's something more he can do that I .
BOSS TWEED: It's none of that, Bill. None of that. His independence is like a rebuke to Tammany. And an insult to you.
BOSS TWEED: prevailed. Monk is an unpredictable power, and a figure of size. He needs to be reckoned with.
BOSS TWEED: them and use them for the good they give off. He hands Bill a sack of coal.
BOSS TWEED: Bill doesn't answer. He HOPS DOWN off the moving wagon, and the Needy give way quickly before him, then regroup and SWARM after Tweed and his coal. The Boss continues with his Tammany spiel-enjoying all the attentionas the Butcher watches, disdainful of Tweed but filled with angry frustration. From his face we .
DISSOLVE TO: 68 INT. DON WHISKERA.NDOS BARBER SHOP DAY . the incredulous face of Monk Eastman, as he looks at Bill the Butcher.
MONK EASTMAN: BILL THE BUTCHER MONK EASTMAN BILL THE BUTCHER out dead.
MONK EASTMAN: BILL THE BUTCHER out dead.
MONK EASTMAN: You were ordered to be. And who would order me among the Natives? You? And would you follow my orders, even if they was being relayed from William Marcy Tweed himself? He EASES himself out of the barber chair. The Butcher TENSES as Monk comes toward him.
MONK EASTMAN: bringis the most generous that's ever been extended. I favor the terms, if not the personalities. So let us decide the way any Native American would appreciate. We'll do it the democratic way. He throws open the door of the barber shop and stands there, beside Bill the Butcher, his arm thrown carelessly around him. PASSERSBY stop in wonderment as Monk ADDRESSES them.
MONK EASTMAN: trouble. They have grown so weak that now they seek my help. They can pay any wage I ask. But I ask you now. Even for money, should I carouse and conspire alongside a boyo like this with gristle on his knife and spittle on his chin every time his cock gets hard? Monk is beaming, the Butcher is appalled. His body tenses like a snake ready to spring. But the people in the street just STARE- They can't believe what they've just heard.
MONK EASTMAN: There. You see. I'm afraid the people have spoken.
MONK EASTMAN: Monk returns to the shop and the comfort of his chair. Bill GLARES at the people in the street. One lock from him starts them moving fast. But they do not look away from him quite so fast, or at him, either, with quite the same fear.
CUT TO: 69 INT. MISSION ( FORMERLY OLD BREWERY ) NIGHT The vast main room has been changed into a dance floor and decorated for the evening. An altar has been hung with bunting; SHIP'S LANTERNS and CANDLES illuminate the place. The REVEREND SHADRACH RALEIGH GREETS everyone. The room, already crowded with CELEBRANTS of all ages, grows quiet as the Dead Rabbits, done up in their party best, show up for the REVEREND RALEIGH REVEREND RALEIGH figures of the greatest prominence here.

REVERAND RALEIGH: Here we make only joyful noises to the Lord. Under the instruction of the bustling Reverend and his HELPERS, the Women skeptically stand away from the Men, who allow themselves to be arranged into a LINE. The Reverend Raleigh escorts the delighted Jenny to a chair that has been placed, by itself, in the center of the room. Jenny sits down, facing away from the rest of the guests. She holds a MIRROR in her REVEREND RALEIGH The first volunteer Reverend Raleigh brings forward is a reluctant Sheeny Mike. There are RUDE COMMENTS as he leads Mike slowly to the center of the room, coming up behind Jenny until she can see Mikels face reflected in the mirror. She SHAKES her head.

REVEREND RALEIGH: More laughing. The BOYS push out one CANDIDATE. Rejected. Now ANOTHER CANDIDATE comes forward. And STILL ANOTHER- Jenny rejects each with the composure of a princess. Now it is Johnny's turn. He WALKS slowly across the big room, and stands behind Jenny, trying to look confident. The moment is long, the room's tense. untiljust once but very decisively-Jenny SHAKES her head. Jenny watches Johnny's face in the mirror. She stays still. Finally, he walks back to the GANG. Now Amsterdam starts toward the center of the room. He keeps his eyes fixed on Jenny. Jenny catches Amsterdam's reflection in the mirror. He STOPS. She NODS her head. Yes. Him. A small BAND strikes up a barely recognizable version of "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," arranged in waltz time. Jenny rises and holds out her arms to Amsterdam. They start to DANCE, a little clumsily, as other COUPLES join them.
AMSTERDAM: No, it's just that I didn't recognize you in the mirror. You still got some of the face the Butcher gave you.
JENNY: No, it's just that I didn't recognize you in the mirror. You still got some of the face the Butcher gave you.

JENNY: No, it's just that I didn't recognize you in the mirror. You still got some of the face the Butcher gave you.
AMSTERDAM: It's not the Butcher, it's the dancing. It shifts my face all around.
JENNY: The Reverend Raleigh and his Helpers DASH among the dancers, distributing LIGHTED CANDLES, which the COUPLES take and hold as they move around the ( she smiles ) And what about after that? After tonight?
AMSTERDAM: ( she smiles ) And what about after that? After tonight?
JENNY: someone else. She takes a candle from the Reverend and holds it so the light FLICKERS on Amsterdam's face.
AMSTERDAM: ready. No more. His eyes, in the candlelight, show both his love and his Resolution. Jenny NODS and they DANCE AWAY . . losing themselves now among the dancers, all moving and holding candles. As they dance, their movement becomes SPLIT, SEQUENTIAL, a study in motion like an old Gjon Mili photograph. Their bodies create a RUSH OF YELLOW LIGHT ACROSS the screen like the tail of a comet.
CUT TO: 70 INT- DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHT In the hallway. JOHNNY stands pressed against a door.
JOHNNY: ( louder; hissing ) AMSTERDAM ( V.O. ) AMSTERDAM comes to the door, half-dressed and sleepy. We see Jenny asleep on the floor inside.

AMSTERDAM: ( Johnny turns, determined ) Alright, alright. Then tell me why like this?
JOHNNY: And he SLUGS him. Hard. Harder even than he thought he could. AMSTERDAM stumbles, stunned, then pulls himself up. And CHARGES at Johnny, knocking him down. The two friends PUNCH, WRESTLE, BITE and PUMMEL EACH OTHER with such extravagant energy that they soon. . ROLL OFF the pier.
CUT TO: 72 EXT. PIER DAWN . onto the muddy ground underneath the pier. They LAND with a shuddering SPLASH in the soggy earth, but they keep fighting .. . as a PACK OF ORPHANS, eyes glinting like night animals, scatter like wild beasts disturbed in their burrow. Amsterdam has the physical advantage, and more skill. But Johnny has the fury. All the feeling and the frustration rain out of him physically, making the match nearly even. The Orphan Pack watches the fight silently, showing no favoritism or emotion, just an edge of curiosity. Amsterdam HITS Johnny a wicked combination that makes him SINK to one knee in the mud. But Johnny will not go down. Amsterdam, hurt himself, just stares at Johnny in wonderment.
AMSTERDAM: And he pulls himself to his feet and THROWS a roundhouse at Amsterdam, who half-staggers out of the way. The moment throws Johnny off balance, and he falls in the mud again, this time on all fours. Amsterdam SINKS down beside him.

AMSTERDAM: Johnny won't stop: he throws a punch that Amsterdam can see coming a block away. But he's too tired too duck; or maybe he's just fed up. He takes the punch and FALLS on his back.
AMSTERDAM: And he THROWS HIMSELF on Amsterdam. It's more like he rolls over onto him than anything, but he's on top of him now, hitting him in the face with all he's got left in him.
JOHNNY: And he THROWS HIMSELF on Amsterdam. It's more like he rolls over onto him than anything, but he's on top of him now, hitting him in the face with all he's got left in him.
AMSTERDAM: Amsterdam HEAVES Johnny off and pops him a solid SWIPE to the jaw. That does it. Lights out. Johnny falls unconscious into the slime beneath the The Orphan Pack keeps staring from the shadow with their ferret eyes. Still silent. Amsterdam STRUGGLES to his feet, stops at the river's edge to get a handful of water to revive himself. Then he looks over, sees his unconscious friend.
AMSTERDAM: He grabs Johnny's body by the shoulders and pulls him to the river's edge. He gets some water on his hand, lets it drip over Johnny's face, washing away a little of the blood. Not enough. He draws some more water, and RUBS it gently onto Johnny's face. CLOSE: on the motion of his hand. It is nearly gentle.

MONK EASTMAN: Bill NODS emphatically at Don Whiskerandos, who is clearly terrified. Bill nods again, almost vehemently. Don Whiskerandos SHAKES his head. Bill GLARES at him. The Barber takes a STEP BACK. Monk opens his eyes, starts to size up the situation.
MONK EASTMAN: What the hell. .and the scissors, held by Don Whiskerandos and pushed by Bill the Butcher, meet Monk full in the face as he bolts from the chair. The long scissor BLADE SINKS into Monkls right eye. MONK BELLOWS, staggers toward Don Whiskerandos, who shrinks against the wall. The scissor protrudes from Monk's eye as he RAGES, blinded by blood, now reaching out for the Butcher
CUT TO: 74 INT. RESTAURANT/PARK ROW Boss Tweed reigns in the banquet room of a vast, gaslit restaurant, at a long table overburdened with food. Seated along both sides of the table is an array of the city's POWER BROKERS, with whom Tweed and his Tammany MINIONS mix easily. Their attitude toward the Power Brokers is a mixture of ribald fawning and fine condescension; the Power Brokers, in turn, enjoy the food, and the MUSIC from a small BAND, and the DANCING GIRLS who flirt and entertain them, while exuding the unmistakable impression of amateur anthropologists exploring a decaying civilization. Tweed is courting and joking with a bewhiskered HORACE GREELEY, editor of the influential Tribune.
GREELEY: Mr. Tweed .
BOSS TWEED: BOSS TWEED Virtuels on your conscience, Horace, but Tammany's in your heart. Killoran materializes at Tweed's side and whispers something quickly, discreetly in his ear. Tweed EXCUSES himself, rises quickly and WALKS across the restaurant floor. . past the Band and the Dancing Giris . . to the swinging doors of the kitchen. As he pushes open the SWINGING DOOR, his face has lost its humor.

CUT TO: 75 INT. KITCHEN/RESTAURANT/PARK ROW A madhouse of activity. WAITERS in black suits, vests and serving outfits STREAM by carrying huge TRAYS of food while the KITCHEN STAFF works double-time to keep up with the unceasing volume. As Boss Tweed walks in, Bill the Butcher PLUCKS a piece of roasted poultry off a tray as it's carried out the door.
BOSS TWEED: BILL THE BUTCHER like this.
BOSS TWEED: him, and you come back with his blood on your hands.
BOSS TWEED: BILL THE BUTCHER you talk. As they talk, and the tension builds between them, the two men are constantly BUFFETED by the swinging doors and the unending stream of
BOSS TWEED: BILL THE BUTCHER the streets a while back, but no more. You got power but you ain't got muscle and you ain't got a notion what it means to be a warrior.
BOSS TWEED: BILL THE BUTCHER "If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out." I followed that law with my own knife and hand. The first I ever fought Priest Vallon, he bested me. And when he came to bring me to death, I looked away and he watched me and he let me go. The shame was worse than the killing. I would have cut out both eyes if I could still have fought, but cutting just the one gave me heart. When I killed Priest Vallon, that restored me. Now I sent Monk Eastman over I got glory. I got all there is, and small thanks to you, squire.
BOSS TWEED: how we help each other. If it wasn't for me would be happy enough to plunder the Points and put the fear into people who don't know nothing else. But Bill, I'm only saying. I'm counselinm. look in the distance. You want to sit at my table, fine. But you must always remember who the host is. It's not a matter of courage welre talking. It's manners. Bill grabs another piece of food from a tray.
BOSS TWEED: BILL THE BUTCHER BOSS TWEED together than separate. We'll dine together sometime. Bill the Butcher nods, appeased, and leaves, swaggering his way through the kitchen chaos, making everyone get out of his way. Boss Tweed watches him go, his expression changing from bemused appeasement to molten rage.

CUT TO: 76 INT. RESTAURANT/PARK ROW Later. Everyone's gone except some WAITERS, cleaning up, and Boss Tweed and Daniel Killoran, who sit at the end of the banquet table. Leftover plates of food have been massed at Tweedls place and, as he talks, he PICKS from them.
BOSS TWEED: most prominent figure in the Five Pointsa man of myth and momentwho is there to take his place? ( as Killoran starts to answer ) Of course. Then what do we do about the Butcher? He's too useful to be killed, but he must be checked.
KILLARAN: BOSS TWEED have blood ties to the gangs. They can't be trusted. And any cops that can be trusted are too craven to be any use. If Bill's to be checked, it must come from within the Points, not without.

BOSS TWEED: like a fine filet. Who else is there?
KILLORAN: Country McCleesterls bunch, too, and the Plug Uglies, but there's none that have the promise of the Dead Rabbits, or the stake, neither.

KILLORAN: for the death of his father, and he's got the heart to carry it forward. He'll have the skill and power soon enough.

KILLORAN: BOSS TWEED They'll cross with the Natives soon enough and keep each other occupied.
BOSS TWEED: They'll cross with the Natives soon enough and keep each other occupied.
KILLORAN: BOSS TWEED Daniel, I might just have to oil up my old musket. What do you think of that, eh? Boss Tweed gets up from the table. A WAITER is DIMMING the gaslights, filling the room with deep shadows.

JENNY: She holds her hand out as she WALKS slowly toward the milk wagon. She's carrying a huge fistful of GLEAMING COINS. The Natives on the wagon watch her warily. . and are JUMPED from behind by a couple of Dead Rabbits. Amsterdam grabs a milk pitcher from a WOMAN in the crowd, AXES open the spigot on a milk barrel and FILLS the pitcher to overflowing. Jenny JUMPS up on the wagon seat.
JENNY: What's our rate? What do we charge?
AMSTERDAM: established. Then we raise it a penny more than now.

AMSTERDAM: MOTHER JOYCE about the Natives. Across the room, Jenny is sitting talking to a few of the WHORES, one of whom is a mixed-blood Eurasian with long black hair named Emma Loss. She gets up lazily and heads for the bar. As she passes a DRUNK, he reaches out to grab her. She's used to this, and she knocks his hand away. He keeps after her. At the bar, Mother Joyce notices Emma being hassled, but pays no attention: her girls can take care of themselves.

JOHNNY: He can't pay. I can pay.

She GOES IN the house. Amsterdam WATCHES through the window, sees her going up stairs. Then he looks at the dining room, visible distantly through an open kitchen door. He WATCHES, fascinated, fragments of the everyday rituals of a world he's never seen. As SOUNDS drift listlessly from the street beyond, and a light BREEZE blows, WE SEE IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES the serving of a meal; SERVANTS carrying and passing plates; FAMILY MEMBERS reaching for dishes and passing them; the LOW KURMUR of Konversation in accents he has never heard. It's not so much that these people and their life are foreign to him. It is as if he has stepped into another Dimension. He loses his sense of time, and of danger. So that when Jenny TOUCHES his arm she surprises him thoroughly.

GENT 2: even for ned. ( to Jenny ) Tell any who wants they can stay. If they can't pay rent they can join the gang. But make sure the best rooms go to us. Look around .

JENNY: I know this building.
CUT TO: 87 INT. UNDERGROUND/JACOB'S LADDER As Jenny leads Amsterdam through a narrow tunnel. The place is like a weird catacomb: it is narrow and dank, filled with bones of dead animals, of the two- and four-legged variety.
JENNY: there. They're closed off and forgotten since the Reverend opened the mission. Pass me the candle. Amsterdam hands Jenny a stump of candle, which she holds high enough to . that the tunnel has opened onto a small room just above the foundation of Jacob's Ladder. It's a graveyard, memorializing gang members gone to a better worldor worse. Trophies from many gangsincluding the bones and skulls of some Dead Rabbits-litter the place in loose ritual fashion, as if this were a catacomb in Palermo. Stooping low, Jenny walks to a narrow corner of the room, where several PAVING STONES have been laid in the rough pattern of a cross. A slab of slate serves as a headstone, and on it, in fading paint, barely legible, is the name "Maggie Everdeane."
JENNY: the Brewery. One day she slept so drunk she never woke and I brought her back here. Dug this myself. ( beat ) Families. Give here what I gave you. Amsterdam hands her a chest that looks like a small version of Blackbeard's treasure box. She opens it and holds the candle close: inside is the swag from all her cat burglaries. There's a lot of it, GLITTERING with promise in the GUTTERING flame. Jenny starts to dig in her mother's He KNEELS beside her and they dig at the grave with stones and bones.
JENNY: He KNEELS beside her and they dig at the grave with stones and bones.
AMSTERDAM: Amsterdam reaches inside the chest, pulls out a ring and SLIPS it onto Jenny's dirt-covered finger. She KISSES him.

CUT TO: 89 INT. JENNY AND AMSTERDAM'S ROOM/JACOB'S LADDER DAY Better by a little than their place in the old hideout. There's even a window that throws some LIGHT an the few bits of castoff furniture in the room. an the bed where Jenny sleeps with her face turned to the dawn light. and an Amsterdam, who is dressing quietly in the corner. He checks in his coat Pocket,.finds the gold cross . and leaves. Jenny does nat stir.
CUT TO: 90 EXT. GRAVEYARD DAY START CLOSE on: Amsterdam's hand, as he places the gold cross in a small hole at a grave site, then covers it over with dirt. Then WE SEE: Amsterdam is kneeling at his father's grave.
AMSTERDAM: Now he STANDS and TURNS. Jenny is half-hidden behind an elm tree.
AMSTERDAM: Now that I met your mother, you should come and meet my father. As Jenny starts to WALK towards the grave, we see for the first time . . that we are in the country, a graveyard in an open field with an astonishing PANORAMA of New York and the East River. ( MATTE ) The cemetery is atop a hill, and the East River, busy with ferries and vessels of trade, glistens in the near distance. Just beyond it is Manhattan Island: low buildings, winding narrow streets, houses surrounded by open land. A BREEZE off the river rustles Jenny's dress and blows her hair as she steps up to the grave site, looks at the headstone and sees . . it is blank. No name, no date. Clean stane.
JENNY: hand that killed him is the hand that will bury him in peace. He holds up his open hand, covered in dirt.
AMSTERDAM: hand that killed him is the hand that will bury him in peace. He holds up his open hand, covered in dirt.

DISSOLVE TO: 91 MONTAGE The growth of the Dead Rabbits, as we continue to HEAR Amsterdam speak passionately to Jenny. We first see the Rabbits surrounding and OVERTURNING a fire wagon; this starts as a live action scene but soon BLEEDS into SEPIA, then freezes like an old magazine illustration.
91 MONTAGE: The growth of the Dead Rabbits, as we continue to HEAR Amsterdam speak passionately to Jenny. We first see the Rabbits surrounding and OVERTURNING a fire wagon; this starts as a live action scene but soon BLEEDS into SEPIA, then freezes like an old magazine illustration.
DISSOLVE TO: 92 EXT. RIVER DAY . Amsterdam, as he is in the picture, but in live action, SPRINGING to his feet and YELLING at a couple of PRIZEFIGHTERS doing battle in a ring.
AMSTERDAM: Far up the sparkling Hudson, a RAFT floats slowly upstream. It's a huge thing ( perhaps half a city block in size ) crowded with SPORTSMEN. They form a LARGE RING around two mammoth PRIZEFIGHTERS who are brawling with bare knuckles. Amsterdam and Johnny are among the spectators.
JOHNNY: FIGHTER 1 fetches FIGHTER 2 a powerful roundhouse punch that sends him CRASHING to the deck. As soon as he hits the floor, a CARD GIRL appears carrying a sign announcing "Round 37.11 SECONDS drag the stupefied Fighter 2 to his corner, while two BOYS minister to Fighter 1, SUCKING THE BLOOD off his knuckles. A GONG sounds to announce the appearance, in the center of the ring, of the fight promoter, a florid and fulsome P.T. Barnum .
BARNUM: today, but to their sponsors, the Dead Rabbits . ( indicates one side of the ring ) . and the Native Americans. He FLINGS an expansive arm toward the opposite side of the ring, where Bill the Butcher sits with Daniel Killoran and a large group of Natives. Amsterdam and the Butcher eye each other with all the old animosity: it's almost ceremonial now, part of the Tradition.
BARNUM: With their indulgence I'd like to remind you also of the further wonders that await you at my new Museum, located on Broadway. There are BOOS from the crowd at such untoward commercialism.
BARNUM: from nature and from myth! ( continued boos ) And to encourage you also in the view that new Albany ordinances forbidding sportive violence on land shouldn't dampen your enthusiasm for wagering. Bets down, entlegen, and you gents.. ( indicated fighters ) . fists up! The Fighters come to center ring, circle each other, then start slugging. A flurry of punches, and Fighter 2 GOES DOWN again. As he hits the deck, the round automatically ends and the between-rounds ritual takes place never lost before.
JOHNNY: never lost before.
AMSTERDAM: It's time to squeeze the trigger, John. The next round begins and the Fighters set to, MAULING each other pushing back.
JOHNNY: It's time to squeeze the trigger, John. The next round begins and the Fighters set to, MAULING each other pushing back.
AMSTERDAM: It's time to squeeze the trigger, John. The next round begins and the Fighters set to, MAULING each other pushing back.
JOHNNY: pushing back.
AMSTERDAM: and future of this city. If the Rabbits is going to keep growing, we're going to have to throw in with Tammany some way. The action in the ring is FURIOUS. The Crowd cheers. Fighter 1 seems about to go down, but recovers and starts returning punishment to Fighter 2.

JOHNNY: won't leave us alone forever. And the Natives is strong as they ever been! In the ring, Fighter 1 drives Fighter 2 to the deck again, and this time
AMSTERDAM: You call that strong, John? In the ring, a couple of agitated NATIVE AMERICANS are trying to get at the Rabbit-sponsored winner. RABBITS start to RUSH the ring but Amsterdam WAVES them back.
AMSTERDAM: This is our time now!
BARNUM: The winner. gentlemen, please! . the winner in the 39th round is the Dead Rabbits champion, High Water Dobbs . please, gentlemen! The unofficial ring COMBAT continues, knocking Barnum about, as the new champ throws marauding Natives around like empty flower sacks. Amsterdam iumps into the fray, PUSHES some Natives away. They start for him but the champ stands them off while Amsterdam WHISPERS to Barnum.
BARNUM: promises . ( Amsterdam whispers to him briefly ) . something large, something grand, something epic. The greatest these are my own words, of course the greatest righting of the gravest wrong ever done in the Five Points. The crowd quiets, their sporting blood still up, curiosity engaged. Only Johnny seems glum, concerned. This is to be a duel not for money, but for honor! A fight to the death.
AMSTERDAM: To the death. If he can stand up to it.
BARNUM: of the two champions are Amsterdam Vallon, here beside me, and . and Mr. William Poole, known to all as .
AMSTERDAM: Don't do it, you can't do it! There's the Conscription to deal with, and elections coming, too. That's your calling now, not these ancient quarrels.
KILLORAN: Don't do it, you can't do it! There's the Conscription to deal with, and elections coming, too. That's your calling now, not these ancient quarrels.
AMSTERDAM: He takes the Butcher's hand. The duel is on.
CUT TO: 93 INT./EXT. DRAFT REGISTRATION OFFICE START CLOSE ON: money being counted out: $300. And a RECEIPT quickly written and given. We think at first this must be a bet being made on the duel between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher- But we go WIDER to reveal: an office, tables and chairs, and a line. Two lines, in fact. One, very long, filled with young man. And the second, very short, in which a CLERK is handing the receipt to a PROSPEROUS YOUNG
CLERK: Keep it somewhere safe.
DRAFTEE 1: DRAFTEE 2 The Prosperous Young Man HURRIES away, but spots Boss Tweed and Daniel Killoran as he leaves.
DRAFTEE 2: The Prosperous Young Man HURRIES away, but spots Boss Tweed and Daniel Killoran as he leaves.
BOSS TWEED: exemption. You might remind your father, though, that you saw me here today, minding that the law's strictly and equitably enforced. The Prosperous Young Man hurries out, as the Draftees continue to holler abuse. Boss Tweed HEADS for them, followed by Killoran.
KILLORAN: us in elections.
BOSS TWEED: treated us with sufferance, and we must extend the same regard to them. ( to Draftees ) Boys, we are bound by honor and love of country to fight in this time of DRAFTEE 4 BOSS TWEED suddenly a frail and finite thing. We must ask ourselves how.

KILLORAN: BOSS TWEED ( turns to the Draftees in the street ) Boys, I've just had a word with your compatriots inside, and if you show half the sand and a fraction of the spirit they have manifeste for joining this great struggle. There is a chorus of BOOS and JEEPS from the Draftees outside.

For Killoran and the Tammany Boyos, this is like a circus stunt. They watch Mike's ascent with pleasure. Sheeny Mike is quite pleased with himself as he nears the top of the pole.

CUT TO: 100 EXT. STREET/JACOB'S LADDER NIGHT A building burns at the end of the street, spreading a silhouette of smoke and flame in the air. . as a LION CHARGES down the street, growling, scattering RIOTERS in its wake. It's a mad, frightening sight, like a fulfillment of the Biblical prophecy produced by P.T Barnum, whose Museum is burning in the distance. SCREAMS, YELLS, CURSES and GROANS. CRIES of pain and fear as RIOTERS jump out of the way of the wild animal, then course up the street toward Broadway burning in the distance. From ABOVE, on the roof of Jacob's Ladder, Amsterdam and Jenny watch the madness below.
AMSTERDAM: That must be the vanguard of Barnum's army.

CUT TO: 101 INT. UNDERGROUND/JACOB'S LADDER Jenny digs out her treasure from her mother's grave, throws open the box, starts to GRAB all the swag she can and hide it on her person. in her pockets, under her clothes, anywhere. She takes as much as she can, but she has to travel fast.
CUT TO: 102 EXT. STREET NIGHT Beginning a swift series of scenes that are like a laudanum nightmare. The street is JAMMED with people fleeing and people fighting. as Jenny forces her way through, trying to escape. A small mob starts to ATTACK a house where a TERRIFIED FAMILY stands in the doorway.
FAMILY MAN: MOB MAN MOB WOMAN a flame against the draft! The WIFE begs her husband not to join the mob, but they PULL HIM out into the street. The Mob Woman hands the Wife a candle, then runs back to join the mob. Jenny starts to cross Paradise Square now. tries to cross, anyway. and passes the stand where Tweed delivered his speech that very morning. She sees: the Cavalry officer. Several MOB WOMEN have revived him with water. He has been beaten terribly, but as he MOANS and starts to regain consciousness, the MOB WOMEN fall upon him with fresh fury, KICKING and HITTING his helpless body. They BREAK his bones with rocks and TEAR OFF the fancy braid of his uniform to hang around their necks. Now a SECOND MOB RUSHES toward the first from the opposite side of Paradise Square. Chaos. Jenny is buffeted wildly. It's like being in a whirlpool. She grabs a LITTLE GIRL whose face is bruised and blaody but whose eyes shine wildly.

MOB WOMAN: a flame against the draft! The WIFE begs her husband not to join the mob, but they PULL HIM out into the street. The Mob Woman hands the Wife a candle, then runs back to join the mob. Jenny starts to cross Paradise Square now. tries to cross, anyway. and passes the stand where Tweed delivered his speech that very morning. She sees: the Cavalry officer. Several MOB WOMEN have revived him with water. He has been beaten terribly, but as he MOANS and starts to regain consciousness, the MOB WOMEN fall upon him with fresh fury, KICKING and HITTING his helpless body. They BREAK his bones with rocks and TEAR OFF the fancy braid of his uniform to hang around their necks. Now a SECOND MOB RUSHES toward the first from the opposite side of Paradise Square. Chaos. Jenny is buffeted wildly. It's like being in a whirlpool. She grabs a LITTLE GIRL whose face is bruised and blaody but whose eyes shine wildly.
JENNY: LITTLE GIRL CUT TO 103 EXT. STREET/FIVE POINTS NIGHT As Jenny presses her way through the mob-devoured streets. She sees: MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN attacking a small group of BLACKS.

BOY: Jenny looks ahead, sees: the river, in the distance. And flames. She runs forward, STUMBLES. Some of the swag FALLS to the street. She SCRAMBLES to pick it up as Rioters rush by her.
CUT TO: 104 EXT. PIERS HUDSON RIVER NIGHT MATTE: The surface of the water looks like a mirror made of flame. The piers are BURNING. The docks are ash. SAILORS battle a MOB for possession of a small rowboat. As they fight, the boat starts to DRIFT. Jenny spots it, RUNS for it . but so does ANOTHER GIRL. Younger than Tenny20 maybe, Jennyls age when Amsterdam fell in love with her. They both get to the boat at the same time. Each grips it by a gunwale, and they STARE at each other like two jungle beasts over a kill.
JENNY: The Girl lunges at her with a knite, and Jenny SHOOTS. The GIRL slides into the flame-reflecting Hudson as if she drowning in a pit of lava. Jenny climbs into the boat and frantically starts to row. We stay CLOSE on her . working the oars clumsily, furiously . moving the boat across the water, trying to get away from the city. . and we go WIDER now. A huge line of IRONlike the side of a glacier. bisects the frame, then starts to move. Jenny turns, SEES it. It is . . the looming hull of an ironclad war ship ( MATTE ). It LOBS cannon fire into the city, setting off tremendous explosions. Jenny TURNS back for the shore. . as cannonballs land, devastating rioters.
CUT TO: 105 EXT. SHORE/RIVER NIGHT MATTE: Police and MILITIA push the rioters back toward the river like rats. A cannanball EXPLODES in their midst. . injuring many more cops and militia than rioters. The rioters rally, RUN over the bodies of fallen cops and soldiers. Now the advantage is theirs; cops and militia are in retreat. Jenny climbs up on shore and joins the mob as it presses back inland.
CUT TO: 106 EXT. DOYERS STREET/THE BLOODY ANGLE NIGHT Further from the docks. Shells still exploding in the distance. Jenny moves with the marauding mob, recognizes Doyers Street. She splits away from the mob, moves stealthily into the street known as the Bloody Angle. And STOPS. Weird shadows dance on the walls of the buildings. SMOKE and EERIE LIGHT. The angle is lined with lampposts. And from every lamppost dangles the BODY of a black man. Or woman. Or child. Some are still smouldering. At the base of a lamppost, a group of RIOTERS have cut open the hog-tied CORPSE of a black man and are pouring oil into it. One of the Rioters sees Jenny, grins and holds out the TORCH he's holding. She shakes her head and starts to BACK out of the alley. The Rioter touches the torch to the oil in the wound of the corpse. The body IGNITES in flame. The RIOTERS pull on a rope and the body rises, burning, to the top of the lamppost . . where its awful shadow joins all the others in the madhouse refractions on walls all up and down the street. On the street, as the flames dance and the bodies burn, rioters DANCE and SING. Walpurgis Night. From these mad SHADOWS, we.

AMSTERDAM: ( slowly, savoring this ) .we're going to take the banks. The government banks. ( awed silence from all ) Are we not?
JENNY: Seems we are. One by one, then in small groups, the entire gang FOLLOWS her. They are uncertain, reluctant, even frightened at the audacity of the scheme. But they stand with Amsterdam.
CUT TO: 108 INT. MAIN ROOM/TAMMANY HALL NIGHT The crowded main room of Boss Tweed's domain, jammed with anxious POLITICOS and OFFICIALS, as well as a harried group of TELEGRAPH OPERATORS who receive news of the riots from all over Manhattan. There is a huge map of the city against one wall: the place has been converted from a political princedom to an operational headquarters. Johnny Sirocco and Bill The Butcher are there. Other guests include the GOVERNOR, Mayor Fernando Wood, and a badly shaken Horace Greeley.
GREELEY: BOSS TWEED "unjust laws and unsuitable law-givers." The shame!
BOSS TWEED: "unjust laws and unsuitable law-givers." The shame!
GOVERNOR: a criminal rising of the lowest class, of the Gangsters and rabble who have been allowed by Tammany to run lawless!
BOSS TWEED: and the gangs who'll stop it. Isn't that so, Bill?
BOSS TWEED: help. What's the opposition strength, John? To answer, Johnny yanks back a CURTAIN drawn across a high window. The view, looking downtown, is one of almost continual ILLUMINATION every place the eye falls, CANDLES burn in sympathy for the rioters.
JOHNNY: Some of us come from those people, Mayor. I'll not deny they still claim part of me.
MAYOR: Some of us come from those people, Mayor. I'll not deny they still claim part of me.
JOHNNY: Some of us come from those people, Mayor. I'll not deny they still claim part of me.
MAYOR: BOSS TWEED friend here, and by extension, my own judgement. So as proof . John, where will the mob go? What will the gangs do? ( Johnny is uneasy about answering ) Go on, tell them what you told me.

BOSS TWEED: well, I'm afraid he's grown away from us. ( Johnny looks puzzled ) He shows distressing signs of. shall we say, free-thinking. Crime flourishes in chaos, and these riots could encourage Bill to overstep himself. He no longer inspires in me the same trust. well, that you might. If you can prove yourself further.
JOHNNY: BOSS TWEED but small things. Are you equal to greater responsibility and opportunity?

AMSTERDAM: Johnny enters the common room of Jaccb's Ladder, where the Dead Rabbits have gathered to ready themselves. As they work over their weapons and prepare battle dress, Johnny walks through their midst. They do not acknowledge him. except for Jenny.
JENNY: Are you here to spy?
JOHNNY: Are you here to spy?
AMSTERDAM: Are you here to spy?
JOHNNY: Amsterdam leads Johnny off to a shadowy corner of the room where they can talk privately.
JOHNNY: I know what you're doing. I told Tweed what you're doing.
AMSTERDAM: think I'm doing.
JOHNNY: think I'm doing.
AMSTERDAM: think I'm doing.

DISSOLVE TO: 111 INT. NATIVE AMERICAN HIDEOUT . Amsterdam's face, full of resolve, staring unblinking as . . the barrels of two dozen RIFLES SURROUND the edges the screen, boxing Amsterdam in, as if his head were in a frame. And Bill the Butcher gazes at him with astonishment. We are, for the first time, in the Natives' lair, a house hung with American flags of all shapes and vintages, some of them torn by battle, others by years of weather and use. Some of them go back to the early days of the republic. There is not an inch of wood or wall space to be seen for all the stars and stripes.
AMSTERDAM: that's the only way you'll ever see it coming.
AMSTERDAM: Tweed, not Tammany, not those pigs in the street. No onenot even you, Billwill ever take the pleasure of your death away from me. I'd do anything to keep you for my own, even if I have to protect you.
AMSTERDAM: BILL THE BUTCHER BILL THE BUTCHER Tammany. Without me and my Natives they're nothing but a bunch of old horses at a trough.
AMSTERDAM: BILL THE BUTCHER Tammany. Without me and my Natives they're nothing but a bunch of old horses at a trough.
AMSTERDAM: the Points. Then you and me can settle. But if you don't join with me, then there won't be no settlement because you'll be murdered in the street and the whole Points will be mine.
AMSTERDAM: He TURNS his back on the Butcher and starts to walk out, through the entire gang of Natives.
AMSTERDAM: He keeps walking. through the Natives . dozens of ancient enemies glowering at him.
DISSOLVE TO: 112 INT. JACOB'S LADDER ..Amsterdam walking. But this time, he is WALKING among his gang. All the Dead Rabbits are assembled, weapons ready. Jenny is beside him. Then Jimmy Spoils. Then a few others. As the group passes, others STAND and walk with them. . until the whole gang is rallied. . and bound for the passageway in the corner of the room that leads under the building.
DISSOLVE TO: 113 INT. BASEMENT As Amsterdam and the gang heads through the catacomb-like basement, past the graves, into a tunnel. Torchlight GUTTERS all around. Their steps echo like repeated rifle shots.
DISSOLVE TO: 114 INT. TUNNEL The whole gang MARCHES down a tunnel under the Old Brewery. Except for Amsterdam and Jenny, they all wear their tamlas. Many have marks and gang insignia on their faces. All of them have weapons. A lot of weapons. Frightened FACESpeople seeking shelter and safety from the riotsappear in the darkness, then vanish like ghosts. As the Rabbits walk, they summon memories of the first fight, that same march through the tunnels when Amsterdam marched beside his father. Amsterdam's face gives little away. But perhaps he is remembering that day DISSOLVE TO 115 INT. TUNNEL The last tunnel.. Shreds of light from a door in the distance. Amsterdam walks up to the door andjust as Monk Eastman did years beforeKICKS it down. Dim dawn LIGHT FLOODS the tunnel as the Dead Rabbits step out.

CUT TO: 116 EXT. CANAL STREET DAWN The first thing we see is an ELEPHANT, who trumpets fearfully at the sudden sound of the sattere door. The gang stops, wary of this huge refugee from Barnum's Museum, but the animal is more frightened of them. It hurries on down the street. . revealing behind it a group of several dozen RIOTERS who carry a huge American flag and a long wooden plank bearing the legend "No Draft." They stare at the Rabbits with something near reverence.

JENNY: Help me. Oh please help me. He's shot, we need a doctor, please help.
DETACHMENT COMMANDER: they'll have. He doesn't get the chance to finish. Jenny DROPS the Boy from her arms and shoots the Detachment Commander once, cleanly. . as the Boy roles into a prone position and FIRES two shots into the stunned Detachment. . while the Dead Rabbits SWARM from every doorway along the street, FIRING GUNS and brandishing weapons. It's over in seconds. The Detachment has hardly gotten off a shot. Every one of them lies dead or wounded in the street. . as the Rabbits CROUCH over their bodies.
CUT TO: 118 EXT. ARMORY DAY A rifle emplacement manned by a dozen GUARDS- They stand anxious post in front of the Armory. Each window is barred and fortified, and the front door is massive. But the tension in the Guards' faces eases a little when they see . . the Detachment of militia heading towards them down the street. Some of the Detachment are wearing bloody uniform jackets; several are being carried. The Detachment, unrecognized by the Guards, is made up entirely of Dead Rabbits.

The Book says in Revelations, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth." If the hand of God's not on you to fulfill that prophecy, then the hand of Tweed will be. Go on and God bless. Johnny looks like he is about to say something, but he stops; looks at Tweed a moment longer; then nods acknowledgment and leaves.

CUT TO: 120 EXT. ARMORY DAY A TREMENDOUS VOLLEY of GUNFIRE, as if to illustrate the Tweed theory of class warfare. Bodies fall in the street. Bodies fall from the Armory. The building is under siege by the main unit of the MILITIA and by Bill the Butcher and the Natives. The Dead Rabbits are trapped. Johnny SNAKES through the Native American lines, over dead bodies, moving towards Bill, who he sees a hundred yards away. . running over corpses of comrades and enemies toward the MILITIA COMMADER. As SHOT WIDENS, the carnage is revealed. Bodies of Natives, in their uniform dusters, and Rabbits, in their tamlas, lie side by side in the street.
MILITIA COMMANDER: BILL THE BUTCHER we will move! ( turns to his men ) Native Americans, come with me! Any militia that wants to live upright instead of die hunkered down, come with us! Bill STALKS through the lines, rallying the men. And Johnny starts to
JOHNNY: Bill SHOOTS him again, point blank. Johnny screams.
JOHNNY: No. There's no friends for me.
AMSTERDAM: BILL THE BUTCHER Come ahead then. And bring my friend's body. Bill the Butcher SLINGS Johnny's body over his shoulder as easily as if it were an empty sack of flour. . and starts walking thraugh the lines toward the Armory. The Militia watches in disbelief, the Natives in confusion. The Dead Rabbits keep the Butcher in their sights. But no one fires. No one moves. And Bill the Butcher enters the front doors of the Armory.

And Bill the Butcher enters the front doors of the Armory.
CUT TO: 121 INT. ARMORY DAY As the Butcher is admitted through the huge doors which clang SHUT quickly behind him. It's a scene of devastation inside-dozens of dead and wounded everywhere. And enough rifles and munitions to sink Manhattan island. Bill the Butcher stands dead center in the middle of the Armory floor as Amsterdam walks toward him. The Butcher DROPS Johnny's body in a heap at his feet.
AMSTERDAM: BILL THE BUTCHER can move on me anytime. You could drop me before I get to the door.
AMSTERDAM: you come with the Dead Rabbits.
AMSTERDAM: BILL THE BUTCHER ( he turns, leaves )
AMSTERDAM: BILL THE BUTCHER He walks to the doors. The Rabbits guarding it don't make a move. He OPENS it himself and strides out into the street.
CUT TO: 122 EXT./INT. ARMORY DAY Bill walks alone toward the Native/militia lines. From inside. from every window . the Dead Rabbits watch him. The sun is high, but the street is eerily quiet. There are FARAWAY SOUNDS of battle, but here there is only the sound of distant, unheard conversation between Bill, the Militia Commander and some Natives. Amsterdam WATCHES intently. The Butcher and the Militia Commander argue, but we still can't hear what they're saying. There is still no sound. . until, SUDDENLY, we see the Militia Commander's face. Huge. EYES WIDE with surprise as we HEAR the thunderclap of a SHOT. Bill the Butcher has just gutshot the Militia Commander. As if the shot were a signal, the Natives TURN on the militia. It's hellish, close-quarter combat. Guns fired inches from enemies who had just been allies. Knives, swords, bludgeons, kids with dead-rat blackjacks, women with hob-nailed wooden planks, attacking better-armed but totally stunned soldiers. Bill the Butcher falls back toward the Armory, the Natives following him. Inside the Armory, Amsterdam turns to his own greatly diminished gang.
AMSTERDAM: The Rabbits are so stunned to be fighting on the same side as their sworn enemies that, even with Amsterdam's order, no one makes a move. It's Amsterdam who FIRES the first shots. And that unleashes a great VOLLEY from the Armory. . toward the militia. The Butcher and the Natives are closer to the Armory now. and the Armory doors start to open. . when a MILITIA LIEUTENANT SIGNALS . . and MILITIA on the surrounding roofs, waiting for this moment, suddenly open fire.on the Natives below and on the Rabbits on the roof of the armory. Many drop in the street and fall from the Armory roof. . as the Armory doors SWING WIDE to admit the Natives. As they run or stagger inside, the Rabbits start to close the doors. Some Rabbits are cut down by the fire from the rooftops. Other Natives never make it to the doors. And a few are shot. . when the doors close before they can get through.
CUT TO: 123 INT./EXT. ARMORY DAY The Dead Rabbits keep firing, but they have sustained grave losses. The Butcher looks around at the Natives who have made it inside with him: he has perhaps one-quarter of his original strength.
AMSTERDAM: BILL THE BUTCHER Jimmy Spoils and a crew of Natives PUSH a cannon toward the rear of the JIMMY SPOILS BILL THE BUTCHER Amsterdam MOTIONS toward the rear wall and Jimmy swings the cannon around. Everything surrounding them is MOVEMENT and COMMOTION as the remaining members of both gangs TAKE whatever weapons they can carry from the Armory . and Jenny steps forward with a torch, LIGHTING the fuse of the . which ROARS and BLOWS a huge hole in the rear wall of the Armory.

AMSTERDAM: See you in the street. The gang members RUSH for the opening, carrying whatever they can manage. Outside, the MILITIA LIEUTENANT hears the cannon blast. sees no damage to the front of the building. and SIGNALS for a frontal ASSAULT on the HIGH ANGLE FROM ABOVE, CAMERA MOVING as the militia CHARGES . following them forward, then moving ahead to the Armory . SHOOTING straight down inside ( no roof or ceiling ) as the Gangs HURTLE through the still-smoldering hole in the wall . . and drop twenty feet to an alley below. . where militia on the roof try to pick them off. As the militia presses closer from the front, gang defenses start to fall back inside the Armory. Everyone wants to get through that hole. Amsterdam, Jenny, Jimmy Spoils and some of the other gang nembers are carrying TORCHES. Jenny HANDS a torch to the Butcher. Amsterdam MOTIONS them all toward the back of the Armory. But he stays behind. Just for a moment. He BENDS over the crumpled body of Johnny Sirocco, ARRANGES it, folding JOHNNY'S HANDS across his chest.
AMSTERDAM: He STANDS and RUNS for the hole in the wall, where Jenny and the others stand waiting. He TURNS, takes a last look inside the Armory. The militia is BATTERING DOWN the front doors. Then he raises his TORCH over his head. and HURLS it through the air. Jenny and the others do the same. His single torch BLAZES a path of light across the screen. The others, JOINING it, make a fiery CONSTELLATION.
CUT TO: 124 EXT. REAR OF ARMORY/STREETS BEHIND ARMORY DAY As Jenny, Jimmy Spoils, Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam HURTLE through the hole into the alley below. . and start to run through the withering GUNFIRE of the militia on the . getting away. just barely away. As Jenny runs, her swag drops and FALLS from under her clothes. She TURNS to pick it up but Amsterdam PULLS her on.. . and just away from the titanic EXPLOSION of the Armory. The CONCUSSION throws some of the militia from their perches on the roof. It sends a fountain of FLAME and RUBBLE high into the sky. It is VOLCANIC in its brilliance and intensity. The sky turns BLACK with powder, BLAZING ORANGE with flame. In the small streets BEHIND THE ARMORY, many gang members are CRUSHED by debris or burned by FIREBALLS breaking off from the central flame. The Armory is gone. Much of the surrounding area is gone with it. On the ground, everything is smoke, flame, dirt, death, confusion, Corpses everywhere. Gang members and kids running all over, desperate. It looks like the last day of mankind on earth. Bill the Butcher HELPS a couple of fallen Natives, then SEES through the smoke and flame and storm of ash . Amsterdam. Coming towards him.
AMSTERDAM: BILL THE BUTCHER There's nothing left. Amsterdam takes a weapon from his pocket, OPENS it for the Butcher to see: it is the pirate's knife which the Butcher used to kill Priest Vallon.
AMSTERDAM: Bill the Butcher looks tired, sorrowful. He BURIES his face wearily in his arms. And for a moment we think he has given everything up. Amsterdam MOVES toward him, throu Writers : Jay Cocks Steven Zaillian Kenneth Lonergan
