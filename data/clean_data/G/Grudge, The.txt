THE GRUDGE: Written by Stephen Susco
MARIA: Hey. Are you okay?
MARIA: Peter? What's the matter?
KAREN: I'll never get used to this.
DOUG: Maybe we should find a different train station.
KAREN: A public display of affection is considered rude in Japan.
OMITTED: 2b EXT. TOKYO STREET - DAY 2b
KAREN: What's that?
DOUG: We walk past this temple every day, Yeah, but I've never seen this
KAREN: Yeah, but I've never seen this
KAREN: It's a Buddhist ritual. The incense smoke carries the prayers to the spirits of his ancestors, to help them remain at peace.
DOUG: It's amazing. You're like this infinite storehouse of wisdom. Or trivia. I'm not sure which.
KAREN: It's not trivia. It's what they believe. And it's far better, by the way, than your little pollution
KAREN: He turns away for a moment, almost shyly, dropping his cigarette and crushing it. Finally:
DOUG: Nothing. I just I like that about you. You seem to be able to remember everything that's really
DOUG: Except the time.
KAREN: Oh, crap
KAREN: C'mon, you're gonna be late.
KAREN: Uh-uh. Seven years of bad luck. And I might have a vested interest in those years.
DOUG: Is that right?
KAREN: Doug smiles, kissing her romantically. Then:
DOUG: Will I see you tonight?
KAREN: I'll call you when I get home.
DOUG: Fourteen. I hate odd numbers.
ALEX: She's started up a STAIRCASE in the center of the lobby. She turns and comes back down, walking over to Alex.
ALEX: Are you free this afternoon?
KAREN: I just came by to pick up some books I left here. I'm not scheduled to work today
ALEX: I know. But are you free? Do you have class?
KAREN: ( shaking her head: ) Just a test to study for. Why?
ALEX: Your wish has been granted.
ALEX: It's Yoko's case, but she didn't show up for work this morning, and I can't reach her at home. She must be sick, or something. And she has the damn house key.
KAREN: What's this phrase?
ALEX: "Mild dementia with severe lethargy." Apparently she sleeps through most of the day. Her daughter-in-law doesn't work, so she'll probably be there.
ALEX: You're the one who's been bugging me about getting out there on your own. Besides, it's an English-only
ALEX: Here's the address. Use the wall chart if you need help and don't forget to bring a map.

JENNIFER: Not at night.
JENNIFER: I told you, Matthew, you can sleep through anything.
MATTHEW: I'm sorry, sweetheart. It was probably just the move I'm sure she'll get back on schedule.
MATTHEW: You seen my travel mug?
JENNIFER: I didn't unpack it yet.
MATTHEW: Maybe you should say something to the helper, what's her name?
JENNIFER: Who knows? Maybe there's something she can suggest.
MATTHEW: Who knows? Maybe there's something she can suggest.
JENNIFER: Yeah. Maybe.
MATTHEW: I miss seeing this every morning.
MATTHEW: Hey, kiddo. You okay?
JENNIFER: I went for a walk yesterday. Just to explore. I got lost and couldn't find anyone who could speak English, who could help me. I felt so. stupid.
MATTHEW: This will get easier soon, for Mom, for all of us. I promise.
JENNIFER: Or else?
MATTHEW: Or else I'll tell the company it's just not working out, and that we're going back to the States with or without my old job. They can get someone else to crunch their

MATTHEW: Jen? Susan?
MATTHEW: What the hell?
MATTHEW: Mom? Are you alright?
MATTHEW: Where's Jennifer, Mom?
MATTHEW: Did Yoko come today, Mom? Remember? The pretty girl?
MATTHEW: Jen? Are you up there?

DOUG: It's okay. I've got you.
DOUG: Your boss told me what happened. I'm sorry.
DOUG: I talked to your teachers. They said you can take as much time as you need. We could go to Kyoto for a weekend, see those temples you're always talking about.
KAREN: Running away won't help.
DOUG: There's nothing to run away from, Kat. No one blames you for what
KAREN: I'm not even sure what did happen.
DOUG: You went to help someone who was, quite simply, beyond help.
KAREN: No, that's not what I mean.
KAREN: That house. There was something.
DOUG: Don't beat yourself up searching for a greater truth, Kat. An old woman passed away in her sleep. It's sad, but that's all it is
KAREN: Is that how they said she died?
DOUG: I'm sorry this happened to you. But maybe, in a way, it will help you later. Death is an unfortunate but integral part of your future career. There's no avoiding it. Maybe now you'll be more. ready for it.

NAKAGAWA: You are an exchange student? And you have been volunteering at the Health Center for.?
KAREN: Three months. I needed a social welfare credit.
NAKAGAWA: You said this was the first time you'd been in that house?
KAREN: She notices Nakagawa isn't taking notes. He seems somewhat uncomfortable, as if he's building to something:
NAKAGAWA: About the Japanese boy you said you saw there
KAREN: Did you find him?
NAKAGAWA: No, not yet. You said the boy had been taped into the closet?
KAREN: Yes, that's right. He was. holding a cat. A black cat. There was a book in the closet, too. I think it was a journal.
NAKAGAWA: Did it belong to the boy?
KAREN: I don't think so. I think it belonged to a woman.
KAREN: The writing. It looked feminine.
KAREN: I left it on the kitchen table.
NAKAGAWA: I didn't see any book on the table. Perhaps someone moved it. Did you speak with the boy after you opened the closet?
KAREN: I asked him his name. He said
NAKAGAWA: One more question, please.
NAKAGAWA: We found this in the room where.
KAREN: This is him. This is the boy.
NAKAGAWA: Are you certain?
KAREN: Yes. Positive.

DOUG: Karen wait
DOUG: Look, I'm sorry. I was just worried about you, and I know you, Karen.
KAREN: The same thing happened three years ago, Doug. To a Japanese family, who lived in that house. They were all found dead.
DOUG: So you think the events are How would you explain it?
KAREN: How would you explain it?
DOUG: Okay. How about this: the American family knew about what had happened there before, and this knowledge subconsciously caused them to repeat the same events.
DOUG: It's exactly how superstitions survive: if you walk under a ladder and think uh-oh, you're in for some bad luck, sure enough, what do you know? You trip over
KAREN: ( heard it before: ) trip over the curb and sprain your ankle.
DOUG: Makes sense, right?
KAREN: Okay. Then explain this: when I went to that house, I didn't know anything about its past. But yet I still saw.
DOUG: Saw what? Karen?
KAREN: Emma and I were alone in that room, but there was something else there. I'm sure of it.
DOUG: You watched a woman die, Kat. That's a horrible thing to experience. I can't imagine how you must feel. But sometimes the mind tries to cope with terrible things in a way that distorts what actually occurred.
KAREN: You might be right, Doug. But I know what I saw. I think I know what I saw.
DOUG: You just need to rest. We'll get you home, get a good night's sleep.
KAREN: But her eyes speak differently. She covers it well, stepping back and glancing over at the reception desk:

KAREN: You don't believe me.
DOUG: How can I believe you, Karen?
KAREN: ( almost a whisper: )
KAREN: Alex and Yoko are dead.
KAREN: ( intense: ) There's something wrong with that house, Doug. Something really bad. ( re: Peter's photo ) The boy in that house, he had a photo of this man. He died on that same day three years ago. I need to talk to his wife. widow. If I can find out what happened, or if. maybe
DOUG: Maybe, what?
DOUG: I'm concerned about you going out while you're so upset
KAREN: You don't understand. I have to, Because I've been inside that house, Doug. Don't you get it? I've been inside!

KAREN: I think there's a connection between your husband's death and something that happened to me.
MARIA: What happened to you?
KAREN: It's. hard to explain.
KAREN: Look, I know this sounds strange, but. I don't think your husband wanted to die.
MARIA: ( even: ) Then why would he throw himself out a window?
MARIA: Let me guess: `hard to explain'?
MARIA: I put all this behind me. I don't want to open it back up again.
KAREN: If that's true, then why are you still here in Japan?
MARIA: Because I can't leave. I tried. But I couldn't. Not without.
MARIA: He usually didn't wake up before me. But that morning, he did. He made coffee for us. Then he sat there and waited for me to wake up. And when I did, he looked me right in the eye. And then he jumped. The night before we'd been talking about having children together.
