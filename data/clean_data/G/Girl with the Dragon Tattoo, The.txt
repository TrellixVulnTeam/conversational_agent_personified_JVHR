MORELL: What kind is it?
MORELL: And the frame?
MORELL: VANGER O/S
MORELL: No note.
VANGER: I can't take it anymore.
BLOMKVIST: What is this, the media event of the Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it won't work.
REPORTER 1: Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it won't work.
BLOMKVIST: Don't try to play it up, that won't
REPORTER 2: Will you appeal?
BLOMKVIST: I'll appeal to you, Viggo: Find a real story to cover.
TV NEWSCASTER: In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed Wennerstrom - founder and president of The Wennerstrom Group - used State funds intended for industrial development in Poland for an arms deal with the right-wing Ustashe in
BLOMKVIST: Marlboro Red . and a lighter.
ERIKA: Where you been? Walking. Thinking.
BLOMKVIST: Walking. Thinking.
ERIKA: Just one.
BLOMKVIST: Just one.
ERIKA: TV4 called. I told them no statement until we've read the judgment in its entirety.
BLOMKVIST: I have. Who else?
ERIKA: Everyone who's ever wanted to see you humiliated.
BLOMKVIST: You've been on the phone all day I'm as much to blame for this as you.
ERIKA: I'm as much to blame for this as you.
BLOMKVIST: You are? You wrote it?
ERIKA: I read it. I ran it.
BLOMKVIST: Not the same.
ERIKA: Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael.
BLOMKVIST: Mine is.
BLOMKVIST: I'm tired. I feel like climbing under a duvet and sleeping for a
ERIKA: He thinks about it . shakes his head `no.'
ERIKA: I already called Greger and told him I wouldn't be home tonight.
ARMANSKY: It's possible we could wait forever.
FRODE: You called her, I thought. You spoke to her.
ARMANSKY: I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.
FRODE: I don't understand.
ARMANSKY: No one here likes her. So it's better if she works at home.
FRODE: But you told her I wanted to meet But I've told her many more times I prefer her not to meet clients.
ARMANSKY: But I've told her many more times I prefer her not to meet clients.
FRODE: I'm concerned you won't like her. She's different.
ARMANSKY: I'm concerned you won't like her. She's different.
FRODE: In what way.
ARMANSKY: In every way.
ARMANSKY: Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode.
FRODE: How do you do?
SALANDER: Something wrong with the report?
FRODE: No. It seems quite thorough. There's a wealth of data here. But I'm also interested to know what's not in it.
SALANDER: There's nothing not in it.
FRODE: Your opinion of him isn't.
SALANDER: I'm not paid to give my opinion.
FRODE: So you don't have one?
SALANDER: He's clean. In my opinion.
FRODE: He's - excuse me?
SALANDER: He's honest. He's who he presents himself to be. In his business, that's an asset.
FRODE: There's less in his asset column after his conviction today.
SALANDER: That's true. He made a fool of himself with that. If it happened that way.
SALANDER: If he made up the story, that's out of character. So is giving up without a fight. People don't do things that are out of character.
FRODE: Are you saying he was set up?
SALANDER: That wasn't part of my assignment.
FRODE: You're quite right he made a fool of himself professionally. How big of a fool did he make of himself The judgement will just about empty his savings.
SALANDER: The judgement will just about empty his savings.
SALANDER: May I go?
FRODE: Your report is light in another area. His personal life. Anything you chose not to include?
SALANDER: Nothing that warranted inclusion.
FRODE: I'm not sure if that means yes or no.
ARMANSKY: I think what Ms. Salander means, and I agree, is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy, even when they're being investigated.
FRODE: Not in this case. I have to know if there's anything about him I might find unsavory - even if she doesn't.
SALANDER: He's had a long sexual relationship with his co-editor. It wrecked his marriage, but not hers. Her husband accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.
FRODE: You were right not to include that.
SALANDER: I know.
FRODE: Anything else?
SALANDER: Please think before you say no.
FRODE: Please think before you say no.
SALANDER: I did.
FRODE: I don't want to be surprised by something later.
FRODE: So. Nothing else. In the personal department. You're sure.
SALANDER: ( pause ) He likes sandwiches.
ERIKA: Usually when I wake up in a cold bed, it's at home.
BLOMKVIST: What are you doing?
ERIKA: What are you doing?
BLOMKVIST: Writing the press release.
ERIKA: Saying -
BLOMKVIST: You're taking over as publisher. You're sorry for any nuisance Wennerstrom was caused. I can't be reached for comment.
ERIKA: You're giving up.
BLOMKVIST: Just taking a few steps aside. For you.
ERIKA: This makes me sick.
GREGER: You needed a better attorney. You needed your sister.
BLOMKVIST: She offered.
ANNIKA: He declined.
BLOMKVIST: As she hoped.
ANNIKA: Never a good idea mixing family and And I still would have lost.
BLOMKVIST: And I still would have lost.
GREGOR: Did you have . anything on him.
BLOMKVIST: I had a lot. It just wasn't any It wasn't even about Mikael. It was Wennerstrom sending a message to the press as a whole - and the FSA: Don't ask questions.
ERIKA: It wasn't even about Mikael. It was Wennerstrom sending a message to the press as a whole - and the FSA: Don't ask questions.
BLOMKVIST: I'm fine, Nilla. You don't have to worry about me.
PERNILLA: Mom's worried.
BLOMKVIST: About me?
PERNILLA: About all that money.
DOCTOR: You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?
SALANDER: His ward. He doesn't have a
SALANDER: 21 INT. ICU - SODER HOSPITAL - LATER - NIGHT 21
BLOMKVIST: Nilla? What are you doing?
PERNILLA: ( pause ) You're not serious.
BLOMKVIST: ( pause ) You're not serious.
PERNILLA: I don't want to talk about it since I know you won't approve.
BLOMKVIST: Of - Light of Life.
PERNILLA: Light of Life.
BLOMKVIST: Light of - what? What is that?
PERNILLA: You think it's all senseless but it isn't. It's more natural to believe in something than not to.
BLOMKVIST: Excuse me.
BLOMKVIST: FRODE O/S
BLOMKVIST: FRODE O/S
BLOMKVIST: Of course.
BLOMKVIST: You know, you're calling at an awkward time.
BLOMKVIST: That's not what I mean.
BLOMKVIST: Excuse me?
BLOMKVIST: Have him call me.
BLOMKVIST: No. Sorry.
FRODE: First time in Hedestad?
BLOMKVIST: And last, I'm sure.
FRODE: It's lovely in the spring.
BLOMKVIST: You said it was lovely in winter.
FRODE: This is unseasonable.
BLOMKVIST: I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Unless we get snowed in . I'm joking. You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish.
FRODE: Unless we get snowed in . I'm joking. You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish.
VANGER: Welcome. Come inside. It's warm.
VANGER: Thank you for coming way out here. Anna, take Mr. Blomkvist's insufficient coat. Would you like to freshen up? We'll be having dinner later. For now, hot tea is waiting. Unless you'd like a drink instead. What would you like?
FRODE: Mr. Blomkvist would like to be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm.
VANGER: I can't stay for dinner.
BLOMKVIST: I can't stay for dinner.
VANGER: Oh. I guess I'd better be quick then. Thank you, Dirch. Mikael, this way.
VANGER: What do you know about me?
BLOMKVIST: That you used to run one of the biggest industrial firms in the Used to. That's correct.
VANGER: Used to. That's correct.
VANGER: My grandfather forged the tracks the 4:30 train will take you home on - and most of the other pre-state-owned rail lines. We stitched this country together. We made the steel and milled the lumber that built modern Sweden. You know what our most profitable product now is?
VANGER: I'm not obsessed with the declining health of the company, but I am with the settling of accounts - and the clock is ticking. I need your help.
BLOMKVIST: Officially, assisting me with my memoirs. But what you'd really be doing is solving a mystery. And you'd do that by doing what you do so well - this recent legal mishap of yours notwithstanding. You'd be investigating thieves, misers, bullies, and malcontents - the most detestable collection of people you'll ever meet . my family.
VANGER: Officially, assisting me with my memoirs. But what you'd really be doing is solving a mystery. And you'd do that by doing what you do so well - this recent legal mishap of yours notwithstanding. You'd be investigating thieves, misers, bullies, and malcontents - the most detestable collection of people you'll ever meet . my family.
VANGER: Richard, who I may as well start with to get it out of the way, was a Nazi of the first order - joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17.
VANGER: Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word freedom. The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940 - missed all the real excitement - but not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife Margareta and their son, Gottfried.
VANGER: Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father - was what people used to call a Good- They're still called that.
BLOMKVIST: They're still called that.
VANGER: Are they? Okay.
VANGER: He was a charmer, a ladies man, a drunk. In other words, a born salesman - which is what he did for the company - traveling around, taking clients out to dinner and so Someone has to do it.
BLOMKVIST: Someone has to do it.
VANGER: That's right. Anyway, he died in 1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the
VANGER: His wife Isabella - who was pretty much useless before as a parent - became even more so after his death - which is when I began looking after their children - Martin - who runs Vanger Industries now that I'm retired - and Harriet.
VANGER: She was bright and curious, a winning combination in any person.
BLOMKVIST: And beautiful.
BLOMKVIST: Something happened to her?
VANGER: Someone in the family murdered Harriet and for the last forty years has been trying to drive me insane.
VANGER: It was September 21st, 1966. A Saturday. Harriet was 16.
VANGER: What was she going to tell me? Why didn't I make time for her? Why didn't I listen?
BLOMKVIST: She couldn't have run away?
VANGER: Not without being seen.
VANGER: Firemen stayed on the bridge all night pumping out the gasoline. And no one swam across, or took a row boat. All of them were still tied up on this side Sunday. Believe me, we She couldn't have fallen and drowned?
BLOMKVIST: She couldn't have fallen and drowned?
VANGER: The currents aren't strong here. Anything that falls into the water turns up nearby. Like her father. His body didn't drift more than ten meters when he drowned the year
VANGER: No. Someone killed her, Mr. Blomkvist. Someone on the island that day. Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday. These were from her.
VANGER: These were from her.
VANGER: These, from her killer.
BLOMKVIST: Who knows about these?
VANGER: Me, the police, the murderer . and now you.
VANGER: - studying their reports and interviews, all the information there was, and it's a lot. I've spent half my life examining the events of a single day.
BLOMKVIST: I understand your frustration. But what you're asking me to do is a waste of money.
VANGER: We haven't discussed your fee.
BLOMKVIST: We don't need to. I can't find something you haven't been able to in forty years.
VANGER: You don't know that. You have a very keen investigative mind.
VANGER: Here's what I propose: You come stay on the island. I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use. You study the material I give you. You find something I've missed - or you don't.
BLOMKVIST: You want me to set aside my life and career for something that's a complete waste of time.
VANGER: Think of it as a well deserved vacation. A way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now. As for compensation, I'll pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes. I'll quadruple it if you solve the mystery.
BLOMKVIST: Mr. ( Vanger ) -
VANGER: I'm not done. I'll throw in one more thing - even though you're a terrible negotiator. It's what you want more than anything else and it can't be bought at any price. I'll give it to you . Hans-Erik
VANGER: He began his career working for me. And I've followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since. You were right about him. You just couldn't prove it.
PLAGUE: Would you like to sit? I could possibly clear a place if necessary.
SALANDER: Did you make it?
PLAGUE: Have you something for me?
PLAGUE: I'm on welfare; I don't administer it. This isn't enough.
SALANDER: I had to pay three months back rent and eat a little bit. It's all I have right now.
PLAGUE: I find that so poignant.
PLAGUE: No `thank you?'
ERIKA: We're in our worst crisis ever and you're writing a memoir?
BLOMKVIST: You fired me; I need something to do.
ERIKA: You fired you; I need you here, not the North Pole. You know what this is going to look like.
BLOMKVIST: Like I've been gutted. Like I'm running away. I am.
BLOMKVIST: Wennerstrom wants to see me waving a white flag, not a red one. And the more it looks like there's a problem between you and me, the more it'll satisfy him.
ERIKA: There is a problem between us. He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down, and you're leaving me to fight him alone.
BLOMKVIST: It's four hours by train. It's not the North Pole.
BLOMKVIST: Think this snow's going to let up anytime soon?
HUSSEIN: This is the North Pole.
BLOMKVIST: What. Milk?
BLOMKVIST: It's me. I'm here. It's fucking cold and I'm on a pay phone. If you tried to call, the reception sucks, and if you tried to email, there's none of that either, so - so - I'm here - and - I can't even speak it's so fucking cold.
NILSSON: I'm Gunner. The caretaker.
NILSSON: You're an author.
BLOMKVIST: I'm writing a biography of Mr. Vanger, yes.
NILSSON: I saw you on television.
BLOMKVIST: That's unfortunate.
NILSSON: Bit of trouble, I guess.
NILSSON: No jail time, though. That's good. Cost you a lot of money though, yeah?
NILSSON: 66 EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY 66
VANGER: The island is owned by my family. Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi if you can believe. Two in the family. He's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse.
BLOMKVIST: He was there that day?
VANGER: Indeed he was.
VANGER: That's his daughter Cecilia's house. They don't speak.
BLOMKVIST: Does anyone speak to anyone on this Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother - who lives there - - she speaks to Harald - which is one of reasons I don't speak to her. Cecilia's brother Birger lives there.
VANGER: Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother - who lives there - - she speaks to Harald - which is one of reasons I don't speak to her. Cecilia's brother Birger lives there.
BLOMKVIST: Who doesn't he speak to?
VANGER: You, probably. Not that you'd want him to. He can be as unpleasant as I'm quickly losing track who's who.
BLOMKVIST: I'm quickly losing track who's who.
VANGER: Oh, how you'll wish were it always so. Soon you'll know us all only too well - with my apologies. Out there is my nephew Martin's house; Harriet's brother.
BLOMKVIST: Who speaks to him?
VANGER: I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you.
VANGER: Someone shooting their dinner. Gunner probably. The caretaker.
BLOMKVIST: I just met him.
VANGER: He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.
VANGER: He lives over there.
BLOMKVIST: And you live here.
VANGER: Your house.
BLOMKVIST: Your house.
VANGER: Yes, you're right. The man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list.
SALANDER: I got a call from social welfare. I've been assigned a new guardian.
MORELL: I'd like to see the girl's room.
VANGER: It's down the hall.
MORELL: I thought this was your house.
VANGER: It is. She lives with me.
MORELL: Are her parents alive?
VANGER: Her mother is.
VANGER: This way.
DET. MORELL: I want to speak to everyone here. That'll take all night so you might want someone to put some coffee on.
YOUNGER VANGER: What about the search?
MORELL: First thing in the morning.
YOUNGER VANGER: No. We should do it now. She could be hurt out there.
VANGER: Please. I beg you.
MORELL: But I also couldn't find a motive. Was it spontaneous? Was it planned? Did she know something someone wished she didn't? Was it about business?
BLOMKVIST: Business? She was sixteen.
MORELL: And very bright. Henrik told me he could easily imagine her running the business someday, which would mean someone else wouldn't.
BLOMKVIST: She was with some friends that day. At a parade. You must have talked to She told them she wasn't feeling well. She left early. But they also said she kept secrets from them, too. The main thing I learned talking to them for hours is that teenage girls are complicated.
MORELL: She told them she wasn't feeling well. She left early. But they also said she kept secrets from them, too. The main thing I learned talking to them for hours is that teenage girls are complicated.
BLOMKVIST: I have one.
MORELL: So you know. Did you bring the last gift Henrik It's at the National Forensic Lab.
BLOMKVIST: It's at the National Forensic Lab.
MORELL: I can tell you what their report will say now: It's a flower common to Europe. All of them are. No prints. No DNA.
BLOMKVIST: I wanted to ask you about this.
MORELL: She received this from Henrik the Christmas before. I studied it more times than I can say. I know every page of it.
BLOMKVIST: It's the last page I'm curious about.
MORELL: As was I.
BLOMKVIST: The only names not alphabetized.
MORELL: They're local Hedestad phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman named Margot, whose mother was Magda, who claimed she didn't know Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died a few years before. The other three were unconnected in any way that I could find.
BLOMKVIST: I've reminded you of things you'd rather forget. I'm sorry.
MORELL: I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka
MORELL: Every policeman has at least one unsolved case. Back then it was old Torstensson. Year after year he kept returning to one - taking out the files - uselessly studying them. As young men, we had to laugh.
BLOMKVIST: Was this also a missing girl case?
MORELL: No, that's not why I mention it. The Rebecka Case is something that happened before Harriet was born. I'm talking about the soul of a policeman. Poor Torstensson could never solve it, and could never let it go.
BJURMAN: How's Mr. Palmgren doing? I was told he had a stroke of some kind.
BJURMAN: What exactly do you do at this security company?
SALANDER: Make coffee and sort mail.
BJURMAN: But not full-time. Not even part- time consistently. They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August?
BJURMAN: How much do you earn there?
SALANDER: How much is your rent?
BJURMAN: How much is your rent?
SALANDER: I pay my rent.
BJURMAN: When's the last time you were late?
SALANDER: Do you think that ring in your eyelid makes you attractive?
BJURMAN: Do you think that ring in your eyelid makes you attractive?
BJURMAN: Here's the problem. There a discrepancy between the obligation of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances.
SALANDER: It isn't a discrepancy or a problem. It was clear to him I could manage my own finances.
BJURMAN: But that's not clear to me.
SALANDER: I'm not a child.
BJURMAN: No. You're not. But you were. And between then and now - - two years in the locked ward at St. Stephens, for violent aggression - failure to adapt to four foster homes and seven schools - arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics use, and most recently for assault: a bottle smashed into a man's face. You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking you've improved, but looking at this - - not to mention how you're looking at me now - I can see you haven't. So the Good-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are over. Starting now, you'll be given a monthly allowance. You'll provide me with receipts for your expenses.
SALANDER: I've been on my own since I was No. You've been a persistent burden to the State since you were twelve.
BJURMAN: No. You've been a persistent burden to the State since you were twelve.
BJURMAN: This behavior you're displaying right now is elaborately documented here - - so it would come as a shock to no one if I chose an alternative to the lenient arrangement I just outlined. Is that what you're saying with your silence? You'd prefer
LIV: ( he manages a nod ) We're going to the same place. Hop in.
LIV: I found him at death's door halfway up the hill.
BLOMKVIST: I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.
MARTIN: No, it's a climb for anyone. I should've warned you. Come on in.
LIV: I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Goteborg. When it was sold, I went with it.
MARTIN: A dark day.
LIV: I live in Hong Kong now, but come back to Stockholm for family events, and when I do, I drive up to spend a couple days with Martin.
MARTIN: She comes for the moose steak.
BLOMKVIST: Is that what this is?
MARTIN: Something's open. You like this one, or would you like to try something That one's good.
BLOMKVIST: That one's good.
LIV: I saw you on Sky News a while ago.
BLOMKVIST: That was a dark day.
LIV: Sorry to remind you of it.
BLOMKVIST: It's okay. There are worse things than libel - though I can't immediately think of one in my You're writing a book now, Martin Henrik's biography.
LIV: You're writing a book now, Martin Henrik's biography.
BLOMKVIST: Henrik's biography.
LIV: I love Henrik. He's fascinating. Martin, too. Together they're the Old Sweden and the New.
BLOMKVIST: They are.
LIV: You know about Harriet, right?
LIV: You don't?
BLOMKVIST: I do.
MARTIN: What can't.
LIV: Martin doesn't comment. Just nods. Silence. Then -
BLOMKVIST: Maybe we could talk about that We can talk about it now. Liv knows everything about my crazy family. Which is why she'll never marry me.
MARTIN: We can talk about it now. Liv knows everything about my crazy family. Which is why she'll never marry me.
LIV: That's one reason.
MARTIN: Don't put that in your book. Anything else is fine. Harriet certainly. Everything changed after that. Not just the family, but the How so.
BLOMKVIST: How so.
MARTIN: We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but we're still the largest family-owned company in the country. At the height, we had 40,000 employees. We have about half that now, and that downward slide - anyone can tell you - began after my sister's death. It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit, and his heart.
BLOMKVIST: You were here that day?
MARTIN: Everyone was here, though I didn't get in until after the accident on the bridge. The 4:30 train.
BLOMKVIST: I know it well.
MARTIN: It was a terrible day. And the days after - searching and not finding her - were even worse.
MARTIN: This event, Mikael, has to be a big part of your book.
CECILIA: Hi. I thought I'd come over and say hello. I'm Cecilia.
CECILIA: We're all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family.
BLOMKVIST: It's not about the family. It's about Henrik and the company.
CECILIA: Like I said.
BLOMKVIST: It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone.
CECILIA: Unlike the one that landed you in Unlike that one. Correct.
BLOMKVIST: Unlike that one. Correct.
CECILIA: So, what you're saying is, you're not really here to look into what happened to Harriet.
BLOMKVIST: I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my So all those boxes Gunner carted down here - which are where? - in the closet now? - weren't Henrik's private investigation. I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.
CECILIA: So all those boxes Gunner carted down here - which are where? - in the closet now? - weren't Henrik's private investigation. I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.
BLOMKVIST: Since we're talking about it, since you brought it up, what was Harriet I'm sure Henrik has told you.
CECILIA: I'm sure Henrik has told you.
BLOMKVIST: He was my age then, and so couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager any more than I can with my own daughter. You were her age.
CECILIA: Actually, my sister Anita was closer to her in age.
CECILIA: She knew Harriet better than anyone - certainly better than I did. You should talk to her.
BLOMKVIST: I'd love to, where is she.
CECILIA: If I had to guess - London.
BLOMKVIST: You don't know where your own sister I haven't seen her in years. We never really got along.
CECILIA: I haven't seen her in years. We never really got along.
BLOMKVIST: I'm getting used to that comment.
CECILIA: That's the way it is when you're always after the same boys.
BLOMKVIST: People generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point.
CECILIA: Oh, I'm long over it, and won't ever have to worry about it again. She hates this place even more than I do. She left, moved to London and that was it. You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less I'll try to track her down for you.
BLOMKVIST: I'll try to track her down for you.
CECILIA: Don't bother.
BLOMKVIST: For myself then.
CECILIA: If you do, and try talking to her about us, don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck off.
TECH: You backed up?
SALANDER: Hard drives at home, yeah.
TECH: That's good. This one's dead.
SALANDER: It'll take five minutes. It's Hold, please.
BJURMAN: Have you ever had an STD? When's the last time you were tested for HIV?
BJURMAN: I'm required to ask you these things. It's a matter of health.
SALANDER: Write down anything you want.
BJURMAN: Why do you need such an expensive For work.
SALANDER: For work.
BJURMAN: Making coffee and sorting mail.
SALANDER: I shouldn't even have to ask. I should have control of my money like And you will. Once you show me you can be sociable and get along with people. Can you do that? Shall we start with me? Shall we start now?
BJURMAN: And you will. Once you show me you can be sociable and get along with people. Can you do that? Shall we start with me? Shall we start now?
BJURMAN: If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. That's how normal people are.
BJURMAN: You've done this before. You know what to do.
BJURMAN: You feel that? That's gaberdine. Unzip them. And . And . I like the reticence. I prefer a whore who pretends she isn't. It's almost convincing.
BJURMAN: Here you go. As promised.
BJURMAN: I know you're not thinking about telling anyone about our date. Enjoy your computer games.
BLOMKVIST: Excuse me. I'm sure I should have made an appointment.
ANITA: It's fine. Please. Have a seat.
BLOMKVIST: I'm Mikael.
ANITA: Mikael. How do you do.
ANITA: You're looking for investment counseling, Mikael?
BLOMKVIST: I would if had any money to invest.
ANITA: Excuse me?
BLOMKVIST: I'm writing a biography of your uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here.
ANITA: How is Henrik?
BLOMKVIST: Good. Engaging. I like him.
ANITA: Or my sister. Or anyone else in my predates that, so your recollections are valid.
BLOMKVIST: predates that, so your recollections are valid.
ANITA: that was a question.
BLOMKVIST: the 1960s. To the event that altered everything in Henrik's life.
ANITA: ( he nods ) Everything I knew about that I told to - whatever his name was - that policeman - when it happened.
BLOMKVIST: better than they are now.
ANITA: better than they are now.
BLOMKVIST: I'm trying to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like. Particularly, toward the end.
ANITA: Vanger kids. Crazy mother. Drunken father. At least hers wasn't a Nazi like mine.
BLOMKVIST: I never saw it myself, but you could tell something was going on. One day she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school. The next she'd be studying a Bible like a nun - no Vanger was ever religious - can you imagine? Obviously, she was very unhappy.

BLOMKVIST: She never confided in you what about, There was no specifically. It was everything. It was being part of that family. Henrik's the only decent person in it.
ANITA: There was no specifically. It was everything. It was being part of that family. Henrik's the only decent person in it.
BLOMKVIST: What do you think happened to her?
ANITA: Everyone knows what.
BLOMKVIST: But you have no . thoughts about why, or who.
ANITA: All I know is I always felt sorry for her. Even more than for myself. I got out of there when I was 18 and never went back. She would have done the same but didn't make it to 18.
SALANDER: Mr. Bjurman, please. It's Lisbeth . I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed our appointment. I had a lot of work . no, nothing to be concerned about . I need another advance on my allowance. Can I come to your office tonight? . I don't need a pen, what's the address?
SALANDER: It's me.
BJURMAN: Come on in.
BJURMAN: Like it?
SALANDER: It's nice.
BJURMAN: It's home. So, what do you need money for this time? Grand Theft Auto 5?
SALANDER: He smiles. Steps toward her. Lifts her chin.
BJURMAN: How are you? Been thinking about last time? Decided you wanted to see me again?
SALANDER: I just want my money.
BJURMAN: Well, let's see if I can help you out with that.
SALANDER: She puts her backpack and leather jacket on a chair. Sits on the edge of the bed. He stands over her. She knows what she's supposed to do, but seems unable to.
BJURMAN: Is there a problem?
SALANDER: I just want to know, am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat?
BJURMAN: It's so cute when you do that surly thing. Take my hand Please. I have neighbors. What we're going to do now is teach you the value of money.
BJURMAN: Please. I have neighbors. What we're going to do now is teach you the value of money.
BJURMAN: What we're going to do now is teach you the value of money.
BJURMAN: I forget - did I ask you before if you liked anal sex?
BJURMAN: I'll drive you home.
SALANDER: I can get home on my own.
BJURMAN: Are you sure?
BJURMAN: So, next Saturday, here?
ERIKA: Is it any warmer inside?
BLOMKVIST: 107 INT. COTTAGE - DAY 107
BLOMKVIST: What have I missed besides you?
ERIKA: The steady exodus of two-thirds of our advertisers.
BLOMKVIST: Is that hard to believe? Sitting up here in Lappland with your cat?
ERIKA: Is that hard to believe? Sitting up here in Lappland with your cat?
BLOMKVIST: I'm not. I'm working.
ERIKA: I can see.
BLOMKVIST: Would you like to meet him?
ERIKA: Maybe in about an hour. If you're
VANGER: I apologize if you're having financial problems at the magazine in Mikael's absence.
ERIKA: We'll work through them.
VANGER: Are you sure?
MARTIN: How long do you think you can hang on? Six months or so?
ERIKA: That sounds about right.
VANGER: ( cheerfully ) You know, I used to be in the newspaper business. We owned six dailies back in the 50's.
MARTIN: We still own one. The Courier, here in town.
VANGER: I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else.
MARTIN: So what do you say to taking on a We've never considered it before. We value our independence.
ERIKA: We've never considered it before. We value our independence.
MARTIN: Your independence is dependant on advertisers - if we're being honest. However much you think that is, you'd retain. We don't care about content. Excuse me. Did I miss something?
BLOMKVIST: Excuse me. Did I miss something?
VANGER: We're talking about an investment in the magazine.
BLOMKVIST: I gather. Why would you want to do Not for the return, that's for sure.
MARTIN: Not for the return, that's for sure.
VANGER: ( to Erika ) I feel bad that I've take Mikael away from you at the worst possible time. This is the right thing to do. The moral thing. That's one reason.
ERIKA: The enemies of my friends are my enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much as you hate what he's done to you. So what do you say?
VANGER: The enemies of my friends are my enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much as you hate what he's done to you. So what do you say?
VANGER: So what do you say?
VANGER: Is that a maybe?
VANGER: Wonderful! More wine, Anna.
VANGER: I think Mikael is adapting well to rustic life, by the way.
ERIKA: Have you seen him try to make a fire?
VANGER: Put the logs on end, like this.
BLOMKVIST: How long have you been discussing this with them?
ERIKA: I haven't been. They asked me to come up yesterday.
BLOMKVIST: Why didn't you tell me?
ERIKA: Why would I. You live in the woods.
BLOMKVIST: So I deserve to be treated like an I wanted to hear what they had to say. You would've said no before they could.
ERIKA: I wanted to hear what they had to say. You would've said no before they could.
BLOMKVIST: I'm saying it now. It's not a good You heard me tell them we could hang on for six months. I was lying. Without their money we'll be out of business in three.
ERIKA: You heard me tell them we could hang on for six months. I was lying. Without their money we'll be out of business in three.
BLOMKVIST: You don't know this family. They're We're not marrying into it.
ERIKA: We're not marrying into it.
BLOMKVIST: We are if we do this. It's exactly what we're doing.
ERIKA: You want to say no? Let's say no. Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing.
BLOMKVIST: ERIKA O/S
BLOMKVIST: So are you coming to bed or not.
ERIKA: So are you coming to bed or not.
TATTOO ARTIST: You thinking one arm or both?
SALANDER: Wrists and ankles. But none of these. Just a plain band, like It's sensitive there. Particularly the ankles. It's gonna hurt.
TATTOO ARTIST: It's sensitive there. Particularly the ankles. It's gonna hurt.
SALANDER: How much do one of those cost?
ANNOUNCER: Petrochemical manufacturer Vanger Industries has acquired a controlling interest in Millennium magazine which according to analysts has been in financial trouble since last December when its cofounder Mikael Blomkvist was found guilty of libel against Hans-Erik Wennerstrom -
ERIKA: We made a serious mistake last year, and we regret it. But we're moving forward, and this is the first step.
REPORTER 2: You wouldn't say the first step was your sacking of Mr. Blomkvist?
ERIKA: That's inaccurate. Read the original press release, Viggo. I didn't fire him. He's on sabbatical.
REPORTER 2: I'm not sure, to be honest with you.
ERIKA: I'm not sure, to be honest with you.
MARTIN: Millennium is an excellent magazine. We also think it's undervalued right now, which is good business for us.
REPORTER 3: Is any magazine really undervalued today. How many will be around There's another reason. I don't like Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?
VANGER: There's another reason. I don't like Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?
REPORTER 3: Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?
VANGER: I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue their enemies into submission. If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try it again, he'll find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight You're enjoying this.
REPORTER 3: You're enjoying this.
VANGER: Already it's the most fun I've had in
BLOMKVIST: I want to look at what the paper has in its archive on the parade.
BLOMKVIST: I don't think so.
BLOMKVIST: Because no photographer at any newspaper in the world takes just two photos of anything - especially after having to climb a flight of stairs.
BLOMKVIST: Silence. Then -
BLOMKVIST: Nothing probably. But I know photographers. They're the most insecure people on earth. If it's out of focus, or they don't like the framing, they bury it.
PHOTO EDITOR: The current archive is on CD's, naturally. The older stuff, still negatives. What general period are you interested in?
BLOMKVIST: September, 1966.
BLOMKVIST: Thank you.
PHOTO EDITOR: Is this about Harriet Vanger?
BLOMKVIST: You're too young to know about that.
PHOTO EDITOR: Everyone here grows up knowing about her. It's how we're taught about
BJURMAN: My dear Lisbeth, how are you?
SALANDER: I need more money. I need to pay my
BJURMAN: Come on in. Since we're still figuring out what you like, I went shopping for some new toys.
BJURMAN: Since we're still figuring out what you like, I went shopping for some new toys.
SALANDER: Me, too.
BJURMAN: You, too? What did you buy?
SALANDER: Good. You're alive.
SALANDER: Recognize this?
SALANDER: I had it with me last time. I set it here. Remember? See this snap? It's not a snap. It's a wide-angle micro-lens.
SALANDER: This shows you sodomizing a mentally impaired girl. If it's ever seen outside this room, who'll be institutionalized then?
SALANDER: Here's what's going to happen. Pay attention.
SALANDER: Look at me.
SALANDER: Do I have your attention now?
SALANDER: When you can walk again, which I admit could be a while, we're going to my bank. You'll tell them I alone have access to my account. After that, you'll never contact me again. Each month you'll write a report of a meeting we won't have. You'll describe how well I'm doing, how sociable I'm becoming. Then you'll negotiate with the court to have my declaration of incompetence lifted. If you fail, this video will spread across the Internet like a virus.
SALANDER: I'm taking these with me. I'll be checking on you. If I ever find anyone in here with you, whether she came of her own free will or not -
SALANDER: No. Not the video.
SALANDER: I will kill you.
SALANDER: Do you doubt anything I've said? Do you doubt what's in the reports about me? What do they say when you sum them up? They say I'm No, it okay. You can nod because it's true. I am insane.
SALANDER: I know it'll be hard for you to abide by my rules. Especially no more sex. I'm going to make it easier for you.
SALANDER: Lie still. I've never done this He sees that the thing in her hand is some kind of surgical device, a shiny stripped-down gun with a sharp point and a plastic ink bottle where the bullets would He struggles to twist his body away, but it's useless. She digs the tattooing gun's needle into his chest and begins dragging it back and forth. He screams as dots of blood spatter her plastic mask .
SALANDER: There will be some blood.
PERNILLA: Hi. What are you doing here?
BLOMKVIST: Hi. What are you doing here?
PERNILLA: On my way to Skelleftea. I can only stay a couple hours.
BLOMKVIST: What's in Skelleftea?
PERNILLA: Light of Life Bible Camp.
PERNILLA: They're not dangerous.
BLOMKVIST: It's fine, Nilla. Whatever you want to do is fine. Everybody needs Just so long as it's not God.
PERNILLA: Just so long as it's not God.
BLOMKVIST: I didn't say that.
BLOMKVIST: I'm not around enough to know everything that's going on with you, and I apologize for that. But I'd never want you to not tell me something, even if you think I might not want to hear it.
PERNILLA: ( smiles ) That's what I'm doing.
BLOMKVIST: It should have been me visiting you. I'm sorry.
PERNILLA: It's okay. Everything's good.
PERNILLA: The train begins to move.
BLOMKVIST: The train begins to move.
PERNILLA: Don't go too hard on the Catholics.
BLOMKVIST: The article you're writing.
PERNILLA: The article you're writing.
BLOMKVIST: What are you talking ( about ) -
PERNILLA: The Bible quotes on your desk.
BLOMKVIST: The train clears the platform. He watches after it. What was she talking about? He glances absently to the taxi stand. Hussein points to his taxi. Ride?
BLOMKVIST: Detective Morell, it's Mikael How are you? Not still in Hedestad I hope for your sake.
BLOMKVIST: The Rebecka Case you mentioned. What was her last name if you recall.
BLOMKVIST: Nothing probably.
BLOMKVIST: How was she killed?
BLOMKVIST: Hang on a second.
BLOMKVIST: I'm going to call you back.
BLOMKVIST: What's happened?
MARTIN: We were talking. He started rubbing at his arm. Then collapsed.
BLOMKVIST: Is he ( conscious ) -
MARTIN: I can't talk, Mikael, I have to ( go ) -
BLOMKVIST: Martin pulls out to follow the ambulance to the hospital. Blomkvist watches after them.
FRODE: The good news is he survived. How he does now, we have to see. He's in ICU. Can I have one of those?
BLOMKVIST: A sandwich?
FRODE: A Scotch.
BLOMKVIST: I don't want to be indelicate. But Henrik promised me something when I agreed to do this.
FRODE: ( nods ) I need to know what he has on him. Now. In case.
BLOMKVIST: ( nods ) I need to know what he has on him. Now. In case.
FRODE: In case he dies? That is indelicate.
BLOMKVIST: And I apologize.
FRODE: I don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me. And he can't tell you in the condition he's in. So . is that it then?
BLOMKVIST: We also never discussed who I'd report to if something happened to You'd report to me, but does it matter? We both know nothing's going to come of this.
FRODE: You'd report to me, but does it matter? We both know nothing's going to come of this.
BLOMKVIST: I'm not so sure.
FRODE: What do you mean?
BLOMKVIST: I may have found something.
FRODE: ( pause ) You're joking. ( Blomkvist isn't ) What did you find?
BLOMKVIST: The last time I reported something before I was sure of it, it cost me my savings.
BLOMKVIST: I need a research assistant. Can you authorize that?
FRODE: Yes. Do you have one?
BLOMKVIST: I can find one.
FRODE: I know a good one. She did the background check on you.
BLOMKVIST: Do you think we'd hire anyone for something like this without doing
FRODE: Do you think we'd hire anyone for something like this without doing
FRODE: Yes, it was quite thorough.
BLOMKVIST: I want to read it.
FRODE: That I couldn't authorize.
BLOMKVIST: Mr. Frode was kind enough to share your report with me. The investigator's name is on it, but I can find no record of her, and I'm pretty good at that sort of Would it really matter what her name It would if I wanted to speak to her, which I do.
ARMANSKY: Would it really matter what her name It would if I wanted to speak to her, which I do.
BLOMKVIST: It would if I wanted to speak to her, which I do.
ARMANSKY: Against policy.
BLOMKVIST: You sure?
ARMANSKY: Just like your sources. You Let me give you a name then.
BLOMKVIST: Let me give you a name then.
BLOMKVIST: My sister. She's a lawyer. There's information in here that could only have come from one place. I think you know what I mean.
ARMANSKY: The reason you can find no record of her is because her records have been sealed. She's a ward of the State.
BLOMKVIST: What does that have to do with She's had a rough life. Can we not make it rougher on her?
ARMANSKY: She's had a rough life. Can we not make it rougher on her?
SALANDER: Who is it?
BLOMKVIST: May I come in?
SALANDER: Actually I'm not really up ( yet ) -
BLOMKVIST: That's okay.
BLOMKVIST: I assumed you wouldn't have had breakfast yet so I brought some bagel sandwiches. And tomato juice. Good for hangovers. Where do you keep the Hey. Hey - Who do you think you are?
SALANDER: Hey. Hey - Who do you think you are?
BLOMKVIST: I'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do.
BLOMKVIST: We have a lot to talk about, so why don't you take a shower, put on some clothes and get rid of your
BLOMKVIST: You're awake. Good. Breakfast is
BLOMKVIST: I guess I alarmed you showing up like If you touch me, I'll more than alarm That won't be necessary.
SALANDER: If you touch me, I'll more than alarm That won't be necessary.
BLOMKVIST: That won't be necessary.
BLOMKVIST: Your report on me was quite detailed but for me not very entertaining.
SALANDER: It wasn't meant to be.
BLOMKVIST: When I write about people, I try to entertain the reader.
SALANDER: Wennerstrom wasn't entertained.
BLOMKVIST: Your boss Armansky tells me you only work on things that interest you. I guess I should be flattered. He also says you're the one he goes to for jobs that are, `sensitive' is the word he used. I'll use `illegal,' since that what it was when you hacked into my computer. I'm not going to do anything about that. I could but I won't. What I'm going to do is tell you a story. If it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research it further. If it doesn't, I'll wash the dishes and leave . Are you going to even touch your food?
SALANDER: What kind of research?
BLOMKVIST: Lisbeth - may I call you Lisbeth? I want you to help me catch a killer of
BLOMKVIST: I've identified R.J. Her name's Rebecka Jacobsson.
BLOMKVIST: We need to somehow figure out who they are, what happened to them, what the Leviticus verses have to do with ( anything ) -
BLOMKVIST: What are you doing?
SALANDER: Getting started. You can keep talking if you want.
BLOMKVIST: Would you like this?
SALANDER: Got it.
BLOMKVIST: I'm home.
DET. ISAKSSON: No one's asked me about Magda in over 40 years. No one here even remembers
DET. ISAKSSON: Why would a young lady like you want to know about such a brutal killing.
SALANDER: It interests me.
DET. ISAKSSON: Does it.
DET. ISAKSSON: What's that. A wasp?
SALANDER: A friend of mine calls me that.
DET. ISAKSSON: So you tattoo it on your neck?
DET. ISAKSSON: Who's this friend?
SALANDER: My trainer.
DET. ISAKSSON: Hard for him to picture. But, upon reflection -
SALANDER: Hard for him to picture. But, upon reflection -
DET. ISAKSSON: I have a feeling you're pretty good at that, even though you weigh - what - ninety pounds? Float like a butterfly .
SALANDER: DET. ISAKSSON ( smiles )
DET. ISAKSSON: ( smiles ) Come with me, Muhammad.
DET. ISAKSSON: Her husband was our first suspect - the husband is always the first suspect, and usually the last - but not this time. We moved on to a neighbor. Then a vagrant -
DET. ISAKSSON: Once you get to strangers, it's only a matter of time before you get to gypsies, and you know you're never going to solve it.
SALANDER: How exactly was she killed?
DET. ISAKSSON: Miss - I'm sorry -
SALANDER: DET. ISAKSSON
DET. ISAKSSON: Miss Salander, if you don't mind my asking, when's the last time you ate?
SALANDER: I have a high metabolism. I can't put on weight.
DET. ISAKSSON: That's not why I ask. I ask because it's better to look at what I'm about to show you on an empty stomach.
BLOMKVIST: ( to Frode ) How is he?
FRODE: He needs surgery and there's no DNR. So it's up to the family to decide to resuscitate or not, and they're not good at decisions.
FRODE: How'd it go with Ms. Salander?
BLOMKVIST: She said yes.
BLOMVIST: ( to Frode ) Can I see Henrik?
FRODE: He was asleep when I last looked in. We can check.
ISABELLA: No, you can't check. You can instruct him to pack his things and Mother -
MARTIN: Mother -
ISABELLA: Don't use that tone with me. This family's had enough tragedy without you dredging it all up again.
FRODE: Actually, Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik.
ISABELLA: And who do you work for, Dirch? Remind me who pays your salary?
BIRGER: We should put this to a vote.
MARTIN: Don't be an idiot, Birger.
BIRGER: It's a family decision like any other. Cecilia?
CECILIA: Am I right?
BIRGER: Am I right?
CECILIA: You are so seldom right about anything, it's hard for me to say yes. But ( yes ) -
MARTIN: No. We should do what Henrik wants, and we know what he wants.
ISABELLA: Henrik - is in there fighting for his life. This - - is the last thing he needs.
ISABELLA: Go back to Stockholm. When we want a false chronicle of the family written by a libelist, we know who to call.
DET. ISAKSSON: Forget what she looks like, I vouch for her -
UDDEVALLY DETECTIVE: ( convinced but just barely ) All right. Thanks.
UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE: This way, Miss.
SALANDER: Can I make copies?
UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE: I can make them for you if our machine's been repaired.
SALANDER: That's okay.
MARTIN: My family is impossible. It's why the company is such a mess.
BLOMKVIST: It's all right.
MARTIN: It's not all right, she's unbearable. But it has nothing to do with you. It's between her and Henrik . She lost it when my father died. The drinking - her state of mind - it all got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her, leaving her alone in our old house on the other side of the island like she was excommunicated. She's never forgiven
MARTIN: You have to stay and keep working. You're Henrik's last chance at some kind of resolution. Put this to rest for him one way of the other, and I'll try to keep my mother away. But, please, do it as quickly as you I'll ( try ) - Lisbeth, this is Martin Vanger.
BLOMKVIST: I'll ( try ) - Lisbeth, this is Martin Vanger.
BLOMKVIST: Lisbeth, this is Martin Vanger.
MARTIN: How do you do.
SALANDER: She comes past them without another word. Martin can't help noticing her wasp and handcuff tattoos. Looks after her as she disappears into the cottage. It's hard to believe, but he has to ask:
MARTIN: 166A INT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER 166A
BLOMKVIST: 166A INT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER 166A
BLOMKVIST: Any trouble finding the place?
SALANDER: Everyone in town knows who and where you are.
BLOMKVIST: That's comforting. Are you hungry? Want a sandwich?
SALANDER: Busy setting up her laptop on his desk, starting it up, sitting down at it, she's all but ignoring him.
BLOMKVIST: I used to have a motorcycle. When I was 19.
SALANDER: I know.
SALANDER: The five cases from Harriet's list. And five more she missed - three I'm sure about. Rebecka was the first, like you thought . M.H., is Mari Holmberg - a prostitute in Kalmar - murdered in 1954. Leviticus verse 20, line
SALANDER: Rebecka was the first, like you thought . M.H., is Mari Holmberg - a prostitute in Kalmar - murdered in 1954. Leviticus verse 20, line
BLOMKVIST: ( reading from it ) "If a man lies with a woman having her sickness, he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood."
SALANDER: She was raped and stabbed, but the cause of death was suffocation with a sanitary napkin. R.L. Rakel Lunde,
SALANDER: Cleaning woman and part-time palm reader, tied up with a clothesline, gagged, raped, head crushed with a rock. Leviticus 20:27.
BLOMKVIST: "A woman who is a medium or sorcerer shall be put to death by stoning."
BLOMKVIST: I only smoke outside.
SALANDER: ( ignoring the comment ) Sara Witt, 1964. Daughter of a pastor. Tied to her bed, raped, charred in the fire that burned down her house. Leviticus -
BLOMKVIST: 21:9. "The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father and shall be burned with ( fire ) -
SALANDER: ( on top of his last word ) Magda Lovisa Sjoberg, 1960 -
SALANDER: Found in a barn, stabbed and raped with farm tools. A cow in the next stall with its throat slit, its blood splashed on her, hers on it.
BLOMKVIST: Leviticus 20:16 - "If a woman lies with any beast, you shall kill the woman and the beast, their blood is upon ( them ) -
SALANDER: ( again on his last word ) Lea Persson, 1962 -
SALANDER: Found by her sister in their pet shop - raped, beaten. The killer uncaged the animals, smashed the aquariums. There was a parakeet inside her. Leviticus 26:21/22.
SALANDER: Eva Gustavsson, 1960. A runaway. Raped, strangled, a burnt pigeon tied around her neck. Lena Andersson, 1967, a student. Raped, stabbed, decapitated -
BLOMKVIST: Okay -
SALANDER: I'm not done -
BLOMKVIST: It's all right, we're looking for a serial murderer . But what does it have to do with a 16-year-old girl on an island?
SALANDER: She was looking for him, too.
BLOMKVIST: Rape. Torture. Fire. Animals. Religion. Anything I'm missing?
SALANDER: The names. They're all Biblical. The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary - Sara, Rakel - all from the Old Testament.
BLOMKVIST: Which means they're Jewish names.
BLOMKVIST: If there's one thing the Vangers have more than their share of, it's Nazis. There's one of them.
BLOMKVIST: I can see why Armansky values you so highly. Your work is very good.
SALANDER: It interests me.
BLOMKVIST: I'll take the couch. You can have the bed.
SALANDER: I can sleep on a couch.
BLOMKVIST: So can I.
BLOMKVIST: ( heads off to the bedroom ) Good night.
SALANDER: She switches off the lamp. Then, in a moment, in the dark -
SALANDER: Harriet's name isn't.
BLOMKVIST: Isn't what.
SALANDER: A170 EXT. COTTAGE - MORNING - ESTABLISHING A170 170 INT. COTTAGE - MORNING 170
SALANDER: Going over your notes.
BLOMKVIST: They're encrypted.
SALANDER: Have some coffee.
BLOMKVIST: I will. And then we'll have a talk about what's yours and what's mine.
SALANDER: It's amazing what you figured out from the parade photos.
BLOMKVIST: Thank you.
SALANDER: Too bad you don't have hers.
BLOMKVIST: She doesn't say. He comes over. She plays the iMovie, stops on a frame before Harriet turns her head. Points to a young couple standing among the people behind her. The woman has an Instamatic camera in her hand.
SALANDER: She advances to the next frame: The woman has raised the camera to her eye. And the next: Harriet turning her head in foreground while in the background the flash cube atop the woman's Instamatic flares slightly. Blomkvist is stunned, by both the fact he didn't notice it before, and what it means: Though the woman is taking a snapshot of the parade, she could have inadvertently included in it whatever - whoever - Harriet saw at that moment across the street.
BLOMKVIST: Excuse me.
BLOMKVIST: Can you read that?
SALANDER: A, C, Three - the rest is blocked.
SALANDER: N, something, R, S, J -
BLOMKVIST: Then something, K, something, R, I, F, something, I -
SALANDER: Then something, K, something, R, I, F, something, I -
BLOMKVIST: ( points below the letters ) Is that a phone number?
SALANDER: Too small to read.
BLOMKVIST: I wouldn't think Harald would sign his name like this, would you?
FRODE: I can't say I know how he thinks. He Has anyone spoken to him about me since I've been here?
BLOMKVIST: Has anyone spoken to him about me since I've been here?
FRODE: Maybe Isabella. No one else.
BLOMKVIST: Could she do something like this?
ISABELLA: Who's this creature now?
FRODE: I'm calling this off.
BLOMKVIST: No. You're authorizing me to rent a car.
BLOMKVIST: I'm sorry if that was uncomfortable.
SALANDER: They don't bother me.
BLOMKVIST: I'm sure they're not used to people who look like you.
SALANDER: They don't like you either.
TECH CLERK: I can't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky.
SALANDER: So call him.
TECH CLERK: Next time, I'd prefer you fill out the proper paperwork.
CLERK 1: Can I help you?
BLOMKVIST: I'm waiting for the older gentleman,
BLOMKVIST: The carpentry shop is gone. I don't know if he worked there or not. If he did, maybe he used to buy hardware I don't recognize him. Sorry.
CLERK 2: I don't recognize him. Sorry.
BLOMKVIST: I had to start somewhere. Thanks.
CLERK 2: I'm no detective, but I think I would've started at the retirement
FORSMAN: This is Brannlund's kid. He was a contractor, the father.
BLOMKVIST: Blomkvist writes the name down.
FORSMAN: Blomkvist writes the name down.
BLOMKVIST: You wouldn't happen to know where I could find him, the son?
FORSMAN: Next to his father at the cemetery. He was killed in an accident on a job site years ago. But she might be alive - His widow.
BLOMKVIST: In 1966, you were in Hedestad with your husband.
MILDRED: Oh, my goodness, there we are. Who took this?
BLOMKVIST: Photographer at the local paper.
BLOMKVIST: You were taking pictures, too. Which I'd very much like to see if by some miracle you still have them.
MILDRED: It wouldn't be a miracle. We were on our honeymoon. But why?
BLOMKVIST: This girl was killed that day, soon after seeing something across the street that frightened her.
MILDRED: How awful.
MILDRED: She does look terrified.
BLOMKVIST: Would you mind if I made a copy of
BJURMAN: Ground, please.
SALANDER: How's your sex life?
SALANDER: I didn't care much for your last It felt perfunctory, like your heart wasn't in it. Let's see a little more enthusiasm for my recovery in next month's.
BJURMAN: I under( stand ) -
SALANDER: Don't speak. I don't want to hear your voice. Just nod.
SALANDER: Start looking for a shrink you can bribe to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me.
SALANDER: And stop visiting tattoo removal websites or I'll do it again - right
BLOMKVIST: It's that bad?
BLOMKVIST: Is it still bleeding? It's still bleeding . why is it still bleeding .
SALANDER: Splits it in two thinner lengths with her chewed finger nails - Feeds one of the lengths of floss through the eye of a needle -
BLOMKVIST: What is that - Is that necessary?
SALANDER: We can't just tape it?
BLOMKVIST: We can't just tape it?
SALANDER: She perches on the edge of the tub where he sits - still in his pants - half-submerged in tepid water - bottle of vodka in his hand.
BLOMKVIST: Did you sterilize that?
SALANDER: You didn't?
BLOMKVIST: You didn't?
SALANDER: Drink some more.
BLOMKVIST: Careful, it's my eye.
SALANDER: Don't move.
BLOMKVIST: What am I doing here . why did I ever come up here .
BLOMKVIST: It's too dark to see . did it stop bleeding . I think maybe it has . it still fucking hurts .
BLOMKVIST: It wasn't an accident . Somebody was shooting at me . It's insane . these people are insane .
SALANDER: No one's shooting at you now.
BLOMKVIST: I'm pretty sure this isn't a good
SALANDER: He extracts his head from the cocoon and looks at her.
BLOMKVIST: Apart from the fact that I'm old, we work together.
SALANDER: You work with what's-her-name. That's worked out for you.
BLOMKVIST: I have some standards of behavior, believe it or not.
SALANDER: You need to stop talking.
SALANDER: You want me to open a window?
SALANDER: I like working with you.
BLOMKVIST: I like working with you, too.
FRODE: People hunt on the island, Mikael. Gunner's out there shooting something almost every day for his dinner. It could have been a stray shot.
MARTIN: Not from Gunner. If he wanted to shoot him, he'd have shot him.
FRODE: We get poachers. They're not always such great shots.
MARTIN: Or he's right, Dirch. What if he is? This has to stop.
FRODE: Do you want to stop?
BLOMKVIST: I have police reports, photos, Henrik's notes, my own notes, and Lisbeth's research. What I don't have are Vanger Industries records. That's what I want.
FRODE: Blomkvist doesn't say. Only -
BLOMKVIST: Will you authorize it?
FRODE: I could but why on earth would I?
BLOMKVIST: Because I'm asking.
FRODE: The private corporate records. How far back?
BLOMKVIST: All the way.
BLOMKVIST: Henrik said I have access to everything I need. This is what I That's not what he meant.
FRODE: That's not what he meant.
BLOMKVIST: Let's ask him.
FRODE: He's not well enough to ask.
BLOMKVIST: I'd be happy to sign a nondisclosure statement, if that helps you.
FRODE: Excuse us a moment.
MARTIN: I think Henrik would say yes.
FRODE: That's why he has me. To protect him from himself. This is insane.
MARTIN: What do we have to hide?
FRODE: Over the course of 120 years of doing business? Plenty.
MARTIN: If he needs this to do his job, he should have permission.
SALANDER: What am I looking for?
BLOMKVIST: Any connections between the company's holdings and the towns where the women were killed . and everything about Frode.
BLOMKVIST: I'd like to if I could.
CECILIA: So ask him.
BLOMKVIST: I was wondering if you could do that.
CECILIA: I don't speak to him, as you know.
BLOMKVIST: You couldn't make an exception in my
CECILIA: Are you afraid to be in the same room with him? I'm not saying you shouldn't be.
BLOMKVIST: You won't help me?
CECILIA: 202 INT. VANGER INDUSTRIES - DAY 202
LINDGREN: Are you finished?
SALANDER: No. I need to know where all the factories, offices and projects were from 1949 to 1966.
LINDGREN: You already have everything.
SALANDER: I don't. Nothing on subsidiary corporations, partnerships, or Then you'll have to do without.
LINDGREN: Then you'll have to do without.
SALANDER: Mr. Frode said I have access to whatever I need, and I need this.
LINDGREN: He said you have access to this Call him.
SALANDER: Call him.
HARALD: Sven Olof Lindholm.
HARALD: Blomkvist nods. Has no idea what to say. But Harald waits for more of a response. Finally -
BLOMKVIST: ( taps another ) Birger Furugard. Me. ( and another ) Per Engdahl. ( and another )
HARALD: ( taps another ) Birger Furugard. Me. ( and another ) Per Engdahl. ( and another )
HARALD: But your interest is in my more candid photographic work.
HARALD: Blom . kvist . With an `o' - or a `u.'
BLOMKVIST: An `o.' Blom - kvist.
HARALD: An `o.' Blom - kvist.
HARALD: I'm not a recluse. I don't close my door to anyone. They just don't Perhaps if you redecorated.
BLOMKVIST: Perhaps if you redecorated.
HARALD: Hide the past like they do. Under a thin, shiny veneer. Like an Ikea I'm the most honest of all of them.
BLOMKVIST: The family.
HARALD: Blomkvist opens another shoebox. Lying on top is a photograph of the bridge accident, and, under it, a few more. He takes them out and angles them toward a lamp.
HARALD: Two point eight.
BLOMKVIST: Pardon me?
HARALD: The Zeiss Tessar on my Hasselblad. Excellent lens.
HARALD: Landscape? Some nice landscapes No, it's - I can't tell who it is from this angle.
BLOMKVIST: No, it's - I can't tell who it is from this angle.
HARALD: That's Gottfried's boy.
BLOMKVIST: Harald nods, hands it back, smokes. It's not unusual Martin would have joined the search party - it would be unusual if he hadn't - it's his sister that's missing - but this blazer he's wearing troubles Blomkvist -
HARALD: Handsome but useless young man, Martin. Like his father.
LINDGREN: We're closing.
SALANDER: ( without looking up ) Nowhere near finished.
LINDGREN: I'm not staying late.
SALANDER: I am. And I need access to all the rooms, including any that are locked. Call Frode.
FRODE: Hang on a second - I'm going to let you decide. It's Ms. Lindgren again.
MARTIN: ( takes the phone ) Yes, Ingrid, what's the problem?
MARTIN: It's fine. Just tell her to make sure to leave the keys with security when she's done.
LINDGREN: Stay all night if you want. Leave the keys with the guard.
MARTIN: Your evening stroll?
BLOMKVIST: Hi. How are you?
MARTIN: I stopped at the hospital on my way home. Henrik asked me to ask you Come on in, I'll make you a drink.
BLOMKVIST: Come on in, I'll make you a drink.
MARTIN: Come on in, I'll make you a drink.
MARTIN: What happened to you?
BLOMKVIST: Blomkvist's clothes. The fresh mud stains.
MARTIN: Blomkvist's clothes. The fresh mud stains.
BLOMKVIST: I fell in the dark.
MARTIN: You don't have a flashlight? I'll give you one.
BLOMKVIST: I just wasn't being careful.
MARTIN: How's the investigation?
BLOMKVIST: Nothing new to report. Dirch says Ms. Salander is clever. Maybe she'll turn something up.
MARTIN: Dirch says Ms. Salander is clever. Maybe she'll turn something up.
BLOMKVIST: Martin hands Blomkvist the mini-Maglite.
BLOMKVIST: 222 INT. ARCHIVES - NIGHT 222
SALANDER: Hello, Martin.
BLOMKVIST: What did he say?
MARTIN: You said Henrik asked you to ask me I just did.
BLOMKVIST: You said Henrik asked you to ask me I just did.
MARTIN: I just did.
BLOMKVIST: How the investigation's going. That was his question.
MARTIN: How the investigation's going. That was his question.
BLOMKVIST: Blomkvist's eyes only dart to a rifle bag leaning against the wall next to a box of shells, but Martin follows
MARTIN: You hunt? We should go hunting together sometime.
BLOMKVIST: They drink. Listen to a silence.
MARTIN: Nothing at all? New. To report.
BLOMKVIST: Martin regards Blomkvist in another silence. Then -
MARTIN: I can see you're anxious.
BLOMKVIST: To get home. After your walk.
MARTIN: To get home. After your walk.
BLOMKVIST: I suppose I am.
MARTIN: To have dinner. With your My assistant. Yes.
BLOMKVIST: My assistant. Yes.
MARTIN: We'll have better luck with a gun.
BLOMKVIST: When we go hunting. A gun. Rather than a knife. You just couldn't stay away, could
MARTIN: When we go hunting. A gun. Rather than a knife. You just couldn't stay away, could
MARTIN: A gun. Rather than a knife. You just couldn't stay away, could
MARTIN: You just couldn't stay away, could
MARTIN: I want to show you something. Bring your drink. Leave the knife.
MARTIN: You know what's harder than shooting someone? Just missing them. That was a very good shot up at the cabin.
BLOMKVIST: It didn't work. I'm here.
MARTIN: Mikael, it did work. You're here. Open it.
MARTIN: Open it.
MARTIN: Push it open.
MARTIN: Switch is on the left.
MARTIN: Why didn't you just go home.
BLOMKVIST: I assume you mean the opportunity for that has passed.
MARTIN: How'd you do it? What did you find?
MARTIN: We can talk or we can just get on with it. It's really up to you.
BLOMKVIST: I found a picture no one had seen You. In your Uppsala prep school
MARTIN: You. In your Uppsala prep school
BLOMKVIST: You. In your Uppsala prep school
MARTIN: What does that say?
BLOMKVIST: That you lied about where you were that day. Or rather when.
MARTIN: Did I? If I did, so what. People lie all the time.
BLOMKVIST: It also said that Lena Andersson was a schoolmate.
MARTIN: Lena . Lena was a long time ago. Where's this picture now? With all the other junk on your desk?
BLOMKVIST: A print is. Digital copies are on a secure photo site.
MARTIN: That's a lie . How much does the girl know?
MARTIN: Let's hope it's as much as you. That'll make it more fun. Where is Stockholm. She went there this And that's a lie. She's sitting in our offices looking at more old crap. Our archives manager called me - very perturbed with this girl. Lisbeth. I like that name. Lisbeth. When Lisbeth leaves I'll get a call from security, so I can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives -
BLOMKVIST: Stockholm. She went there this And that's a lie. She's sitting in our offices looking at more old crap. Our archives manager called me - very perturbed with this girl. Lisbeth. I like that name. Lisbeth. When Lisbeth leaves I'll get a call from security, so I can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives -

MARTIN: I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me.
SALANDER: Mikael - ?
MARTIN: So what would you like to know?
MARTIN: You're the journalist, ask me
MARTIN: What do I do with my guests? Is that the question? Well, before - I do what we're doing. Relax, have a drink, converse. I like that part a lot - having a chat when you both know one of you is going to die. After - I simply get rid of them. Out to sea - scattered all over the place like trophies. That's not smart if you ask me. That's just garish and loud. But he was a garish and loud man. Frankly, he got what he deserved.
MARTIN: You can't be a sloppy technician like that. You can't drink to excess like he did. This takes discipline. It's a science of a thousand details. The planning. The execution. The cleanup. I'm sure I don't have to tell you you're going to make quite a
MARTIN: That's the interesting thing. Because most of the time I am just like everyone else. I just have a bigger secret. It's wonderful really - standing there waiting for a train - or on a street corner as people brush past me. You know what I mean;
MARTIN: No. I'm not a rapist. Of course I do that too - and at one time it was enough - but - A rapist, Mikael, gets off on domination. I need . - destruction.
MARTIN: Can I ask you something? Why don't people trust their instincts? They sense something's wrong - someone's walking too close behind them - yet they don't cross the street. You knew something was wrong - you even knew what it was - but you came back into the house. Did I force you? Did I grab you and drag you in? I just offered you a drink. You'd never think the fear of offending could be stronger than the fear of pain - but you know what? It is. They always come willingly.
MARTIN: And then they're here. They know it's over like you do - and still somehow think they have a chance. "Maybe if I say the right thing - if I'm polite - or I cry and beg - maybe I'll survive." And then the moment comes when they realize . no, all hope is gone.
MARTIN: Say something.
BLOMKVIST: You are a sick fuck.
MARTIN: . Is this an interview or an
MARTIN: You're right, this behavior is unacceptable. I know that. But we're not completely different. We both have desires. Satisfying mine just requires more towels.
MARTIN: Anything else you want to know? You sure? All right. Whatever you say.
MARTIN: It might amuse you to know that while you were over here having dinner with me and Liv - who, by the way, finds me very conventional - Irina was down here in the cage. Who's Irina, you ask? A girl I met in Belarus. Just another girl. Another immigrant whore. Who misses
BLOMKVIST: Your sister wasn't just another girl.
MARTIN: What happened to her.
BLOMKVIST: You're choking me -
MARTIN: You found her?
BLOMKVIST: You killed her.
MARTIN: You useless fuckin detective.
MARTIN: Too tight to talk?
MARTIN: Good. I'm tired of talking to you.
MARTIN: Would you like me to do something about that? See? I'm not a monster.
MARTIN: See? I'm not a monster.
MARTIN: You know, I've never had a man in here. I've never touched a man as a matter of fact. Except my father, of course. But that was my duty. Harriet's, too.
MARTIN: It's time. I don't want to be late for my date with our girlfriend.
MARTIN: Goodbye, Mikael.
SALANDER: May I kill him?
BLOMKVIST: He has more guns in the den -
SALANDER: I know.
BLOMKVIST: Where is he?
SALANDER: 234 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN 234
FRODE: Where's Mikael?
SALANDER: Asleep. Coffee? There's no milk.
FRODE: I have some very upsetting news. Martin was killed in a car accident last night.
SALANDER: Frode isn't sure he heard right. Regards Salander sipping her coffee.
FRODE: I said it's sad.
SALANDER: I said it's sad.
FRODE: ( pause ) What do you know about this?
FRODE: I have to talk to ( Mikael ) -
SALANDER: Let him sleep.
FRODE: What are we going to do?
SALANDER: We're going home, Mikael and me. I don't know what you're going to do.
FRODE: I'm going to the police.
SALANDER: Show them the videos while you're at The -
FRODE: The -
SALANDER: Would you like to see them?
FRODE: 236A INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM - LATER - MORNING 236A
BLOMKVIST: How is it someone who's 23 is a ward of the state?
SALANDER: I'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life.
BLOMKVIST: Since when have they said that.
SALANDER: Since I was twelve.
BLOMKVIST: Something happened when you were
BLOMKVIST: It's all right, you don't have to tell me anything -
SALANDER: I tried to kill my father. I burned him alive. Got about 80 percent of
BLOMKVIST: ( pause )
SALANDER: We need milk.
BLOMKVIST: I think so.
SALANDER: I think so.
BLOMKVIST: Martin didn't deny killing anyone. But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused. He was angry - at me - for not being able to tell him what happened to her. He didn't kill her. And his father was dead the year before. What if she did somehow get away? Could she have done that? Could she have done it alone?
BLOMKVIST: Is she's alive, there's only one person in this family who would know where she is.
VANGER: Poor Martin.
BLOMKVIST: I have to go away for a couple days. When I come back, I hope to have an answer for you.
VANGER: Would the young lady mind giving us a moment of privacy.
BLOMKVIST: She's my partner, Henrik. She should
VANGER: What have you found?
BLOMKVIST: I'm not sure.
VANGER: Don't treat me like a child. Tell I can't. I don't know. I need a
BLOMKVIST: I can't. I don't know. I need a
VANGER: I've waited forty years. I can wait another week.
BLOMKVIST: I always liked this song. You don't?
SALANDER: I don't like classical music.
TRINITY: Blomkvist starts to offer his hand before realizing no one else has or will.
PLAGUE: Blomkvist starts to offer his hand before realizing no one else has or will.
SALANDER: Blomkvist starts to offer his hand before realizing no one else has or will.
BLOMKVIST: . Mikael.
SALANDER: The money.
BLOMKVIST: Fuck me.
SALANDER: It's your turn.
BLOMKVIST: It's me. Sorry to bother you.
ANITA: What do you want?
BLOMKVIST: No one's called you?
ANITA: Your cousin.
BLOMKVIST: Your cousin.
BLOMKVIST: What about him?
ANITA: What about him?
BLOMKVIST: He died last Thursday. A car accident. I'm sorry. There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad. I know you haven't been back there in a long time, but -
ANITA: I'm not interested in any memorial.
BLOMKVIST: I understand.
ANITA: What do you understand?
BLOMKVIST: That you don't really care for any of your relatives. Still, I thought you should know.
ANITA: Now I know.
SALANDER: How'd it go?
BLOMKVIST: Okay. I think.
TRINITY: She's on.
BLOMKVIST: She's playing solitaire? And she still hasn't called anyone.
SALANDER: Do we have her cell, too?
BLOMKVIST: Do we have her cell, too?
BLOMKVIST: I was so she'd lead us to her.
SALANDER: Put your hand back on my shoulder.
SALANDER: There's only one reason she wouldn't call Harriet. She can't because Harriet is indeed dead.
BLOMKVIST: I was just thinking. What if -
SALANDER: Ten more seconds.
SALANDER: Okay, what.
BLOMKVIST: I was just thinking, there could be one other possibility.
BLOMKVIST: May I?
ANITA: What is it now.
BLOMKVIST: I want to show you something.
BLOMKVIST: Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook . Harriet.
BLOMKVIST: Anita married in Stockholm in 1967. It's recorded in the Swedish General Register. But the family never knew, did they. I'm guessing she then came here on a passport in her married name, and you followed on her maiden name passport.
HARRIET: Actually, it was the other way around. She thought it safer for me to travel with Spencer myself.
BLOMKVIST: What did he think about that?
HARRIET: Nothing. Only that he loved her. She said, If you love me, you'll do this and not ask why. He never did.
BLOMKVIST: They both died twenty years ago.
HARRIET: A car accident. You found that, too. Is this you?
BLOMKVIST: Is this you?
HARRIET: I was 14 the first time he raped me.
BLOMKVIST: No, my father. He took this picture. Martin didn't start until he died.
HARRIET: No, my father. He took this picture. Martin didn't start until he died.
BLOMKVIST: Why didn't you tell someone?
HARRIET: I did. My mother.
BLOMKVIST: Henrik would have done something.
HARRIET: Would he? I don't know. I almost told him. But I was afraid because of what I did. You still don't understand?
HARRIET: A year after the first time - after many times during that year - my father got drunker than usual one night and started bragging about women he'd killed. He quoted from the Bible as he tore off my clothes. He wrapped a belt around my neck. He wanted to kill me.
HARRIET: He dragged me back to the cabin . All I'd accomplished was substitute one rapist for another.
BLOMKVIST: How'd you get away? Anita?
ANITA: Don't take anything.
ANITA: Leave that, too.
ANITA: Stay absolutely still.
HARRIET: How did you get away?
BLOMKVIST: Someone saved me, too.
BLOMKVIST: How are you feeling?
VANGER: I'm fine. Thank you, Anna.
VANGER: I made you a promise. Whether you found out anything or not.
VANGER: Now. What do you have to tell me.
HARRIET: Hi, Henrik.
FRODE: . I don't even remember Wennerstrom working here, much less being fired .
BLOMKVIST: Why would you. It was a long time ago. Which is more to the point than the money he embezzled.
FRODE: I don't think I'm seeing the point.
BLOMKVIST: Yes, you are.
FRODE: ( another look at the It happened in the 1970's .
BLOMKVIST: Come on, he knows you can't try somebody for this 35 years later. I like Henrik, but he knows that.
FRODE: A man's reputation used to mean something - he still believes that. I'm sure he thought you could destroy Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion.
BLOMKVIST: The "court of public opinion," Dirch, makes celebrities out of girls who shop. Henrik promised me Wennerstrom's carcass on a plate. This isn't even the plate. I can't do anything with this.
FRODE: Of course you're right . I'm sorry.
SALANDER: Fuck these people .
BLOMKVIST: Yeah .
SALANDER: Harriet most of all.
BLOMKVIST: Excuse me?
SALANDER: If she'd done anything but run, Martin wouldn't have been able to kill all those women.
BLOMKVIST: She had no idea he was doing it.
SALANDER: She should have killed her father and That's what you would've done. Not everyone's you.
BLOMKVIST: That's what you would've done. Not everyone's you.
BLOMKVIST: That was meant to be a compliment. Put your arm back on my shoulder.
SALANDER: What happened with Wennerstrom. How did he get you?
BLOMKVIST: I was stupid. I got something from an anonymous source, who I'm sure now worked for him. It was fake. Which he easily proved in court.
SALANDER: You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life was illegal and immoral. Would you feel the same about Wennerstrom?
SALANDER: I started investigating him on my own. Then you showed up and hired me. I haven't had a chance to look at it all - you and Harriet-fucking- Vanger have kept me busy . but I may have something.
BLOMKVIST: ( pause ) On Wennerstrom.
BLOMKVIST: Wennerstrom's Swedish assets are genuine, but they're the only things that are. The rest is funneled through companies in Gibraltar, Colombia, and Macao. These companies produce no products and provide no services. They're shells. They launder money from arms and drug sales, and crime syndicates in Russia. And that money - which accounts for all but 5-percent of his holdings - ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands. It's a completely illegal, criminal empire.
ERIKA: How do you know this?
BLOMKVIST: This time you don't want to know.
ERIKA: This time I do want to know.
BLOMKVIST: I have access to his computer, and his accountants' and lawyers'.
ERIKA: And how do you have that?
BLOMKVIST: I could have gotten it from a source inside the company.
ERIKA: But you didn't.
BLOMKVIST: But that's what you'll say.
ERIKA: But what will you say to me?
BLOMKVIST: That depends on if you really want to I do. Who gave you access?
ERIKA: I do. Who gave you access?
ANNOUNCER: Journalist Mikael Blomkvist - who this time last year was convicted of libel in a Stockholm courtroom - doesn't seem to have learned from that experience. Or maybe he has -
ANNOUNCER: In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges the same company that successfully sued him - The Wennerstrom Group - of criminal activities on a global scale - backing it up with internal financial reports, bank records and emails - annotations almost as long as the article itself.
BLOMKVIST: He'll call it a personal vendetta but it won't work. FI can't ignore banking and securities fraud like this. The police can't ignore the organized crime stuff. They'll both have to investigate.
SALANDER: We'll be back in court, but this time it'll cost him. That's probably it, though. These guys never to

SALANDER: It's embarrassing.
BLOMKVIST: I need to borrow some money.
SALANDER: I need to borrow some money.
SALANDER: His grin stays stitched to his face a moment, then unravels. He puts his wallet away.
SALANDER: I have a chance to make an investment. It's a smart, safe I don't know that I have that much.
BLOMKVIST: I don't know that I have that much.
SALANDER: You do. I'm sorry that I know that. You have 65 thousand in your two

WENNERSTROM: These allegations - like the last ones from this so-called journalist - are as ridiculous as they are untrue -
WENNERSTROM: I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again. I'm looking forward to it.
REPORTER: What about his documentation?
WENNERSTROM: Fabricated. All of it.
ANNOUNCER: The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite as certain as Mr. Wennerstrom of that.
FSA OFFICIAL: If even a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist is alleging proves to be true, not only will there be a securities investigation, but an organized crime inquiry as well.
REPORTER: Mr. Blomkvist names no sources.
