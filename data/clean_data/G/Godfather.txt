MARIO PUZO: FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA THIRD DRAFT PARAMOUNT PICTURES March 29, 1971 New York, New York 10019
THE GODFATHER: While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America." Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.
BONASERA: America has made my fortune. As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.
BONASERA: I raised my daughter in the American fashion; I gave her freedom, but taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a boy friend, not an Italian. She went to the movies with him, stayed out late. Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted; she kept her honor. So they beat her like an animal. When I went to the hospital her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered and held together by wire, and she could not even weep because of the pain. He can barely speak; he is weeping now.
BONASERA: I went to the Police like a good American. These two boys were arrested and brought to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence. Suspended sentence! They went free that very day. I stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those bastards, they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, for Justice, we must go to The Godfather. By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office in his home. The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with patterned shadows. We are watching BONASERA over the shoulder of DON CORLEONE. TOM HAGEN sits near a small table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a glass of wine. We can HEAR music, and the laughter and voices of many people outside.
DON CORLEONE: Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help. I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee.even though our wives are friends.
BONASERA: What do you want of me? I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
DON CORLEONE: And what is that Bonasera? BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.
DON CORLEONE: No. You ask for too much.
BONASERA: I ask for Justice.
DON CORLEONE: The Court gave you justice.
BONASERA: An eye for an eye!
DON CORLEONE: But your daughter is still alive.
BONASERA: Then make them suffer as she suffers. How much shall I pay you. Both HAGEN and SONNY react.
DON CORLEONE: You never think to protect yourself with real friends. You think it's enough to be an American. All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship. And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder.for money.
BONASERA: America has been good to me.
DON CORLEONE: Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera. But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you. Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.
BONASERA: Be my friend.
DON CORLEONE: Good. From me you'll get Justice.
BONASERA: DON CORLEONE Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
DON CORLEONE: Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
DON CORLEONE: Where's Michael?
SONNY: He'll be here Pop, it's still early.
DON CORLEONE: Then the picture will wait for him. Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves back to the house. SONNY gives a delicious smile in the direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI. She returns it. Then he moves to his wife.
SONNY: Sandra, watch the kids. They're running wild.
SANDRA: You watch yourself. HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait. TOM crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is next, straightens, and follows HAGEN.
CLEMENZA: He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief. PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings it to him.
PAULIE: You look terrif on the floor!
CLEMENZA: What are you, a dance judge? Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood. see everything is PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps back into the dance. The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another number in the notebook. TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR- OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his enormous brown shoes. The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by CLEMENZA and PAULIE.
SONNY: Buddy, this is a private party. The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the sedan. SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him. The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card, without saying a word. SONNY steps back, spits on the ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE, and another TWO MEN. He doesn't say a thing for most of the walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.
SONNY: Goddamn FBI.don't respect nothing.
NAZORINE: .a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war.
DON CORLEONE: Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
NAZORINE: Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy. And you see, Godfather. He.my daughter.they.
DON CORLEONE: You want him to stay in this country.
NAZORINE: Godfather, you understand everything.
DON CORLEONE: Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a An Act of Congress!
NAZORINE: ( impressed ) An Act of Congress!
HAGEN: ( nodding ) It will cost. The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE Is that all? Godfather, thank ( backing out, enthusiastically ) Oh, wait till you see the cake I made for your beautiful daughter! NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER. DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.
NAZORINE: Is that all? Godfather, thank Oh, wait till you see the cake I made for your beautiful daughter! NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER. DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.
HAGEN: Who do I give this job to? The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.
DON CORLEONE: Not to one of our paisans.give it to a Jew Congressman in another district. Who else is on the list for today? The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting to see him.
HAGEN: Francesco Nippi. His nephew has been refused parole. A bad case.
DON CORLEONE: Is it necessary?
HAGEN: You understand him better than The DON nods to this. Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.
KAY: I've never seen anything like it.
MICHAEL: I told you I had a lot of relatives. KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop. We see what she sees: Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine Michael, what are those men doing?
KAY: ( amused ) Michael, what are those men doing?
MICHAEL: They're waiting to see my father.
KAY: They're talking to themselves.
MICHAEL: They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
KAY: Why do they bother him on a day like this?
MICHAEL: Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
CARLO: ( whispered ) Cut it out, Connie. The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm, is fat with money.
PAULIE: Who knows? Maybe more. Twenty, thirty grand in small bills cash in that silk purse. Holy Toledo, if this was somebody else's wedding! SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY MANCINI, the Maid of Honor. Every once in a while he glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with some WOMEN. He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear. SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.
WOMAN: Is it true what they say about your husband, Sandra? SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter. Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais. SONNY and LUCY are gone.
KAY: ( in a spooky low tone ) Michael, that scarey guy.Is he a She has picked out LUCA BRASI.
MICHAEL: No. His name is Luca Brasi. You wouldn't like him.
KAY: ( Excited ) Who is he?
MICHAEL: ( Sizing her up ) You really want to know?
KAY: Yes. Tell me.
MICHAEL: You like spaghetti?
KAY: You know I love spaghetti.
MICHAEL: Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story. She starts to eat her spaghetti. She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.
MICHAEL: Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business. They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
KAY: Al Capone!
MICHAEL: My Father sent Luca Brasi after them. He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off.
KAY: Then the legs at the knees.
MICHAEL: Then the legs at the knees.
KAY: Michael you're trying to scare me.
MICHAEL: Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
KAY: Michael, I don't want to hear Then Luca turned to the other man.
MICHAEL: Then Luca turned to the other man.
KAY: Michael, I love you.
MICHAEL: .who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated. The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a tall story.
KAY: I never know when you're telling me the truth.
MICHAEL: I told you you wouldn't like him.
KAY: He's coming over here! LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near their table.
MICHAEL: Tom.Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay How do you do.
KAY: ( having survived LUCA ) How do you do.
MICHAEL: My brother, Tom Hagen.
HAGEN: Hello Kay. Your father's inside, doing some business. He's been asking for you.
MICHAEL: Thanks Tom. HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
KAY: If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
MICHAEL: My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in. He's a good lawyer.
LUCA: ( with difficulty ) Don Corleone.I am honored, and grateful.that you invited me to your home.on the wedding day of May their first child.be a masculine child. I pledge my never ending loyalty. ( he offers the envelope ) For your daughter's bridal purse.
DON CORLEONE: Thank you, Luca, my most valued THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so tightly we might imagine it to be painful.
LUCA: Let me leave you, Don Corleone. I know you are busy. He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with the same formality he entered with. DON CORLEONE breathes more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.
DON CORLEONE: I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
HAGEN: The Senator calledapologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand. Also, some of the Judges.they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil DON CORLEONE is not pleased.
HAGEN: The action is narcotics. Sollozzo has contacts in Turkey for the poppy, in Sicily for the plants to process down to morphine or up to heroin. Also he has access to this country. He's coming to us for financial help, and some sort of immunity from the law. For that we get a piece of the action, I couldn't find out how much. Sollozzo is vouched for by the Tattaglia family, and they may have a piece of the action. They call Sollozzo the Turk. He's spent a lot of time in Turkey and is suppose to have a Turkish wife and kids. He's suppose to be very quick with the knife, or was, when he was younger. Only in matters of business and with some reasonable complaint. Also he has an American wife and three children and he is a good family man. THE DON nods.
HAGEN: He's his own boss, and very And with prison record.
DON CORLEONE: And with prison record.
HAGEN: Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States. He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
DON CORLEONE: When did he call?
HAGEN: This morning.
DON CORLEONE: On a day like this. Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now. Write that down before you forget it. The Turk will wait. We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers from outside. In Italian, with unmistakable style.
DON CORLEONE: What that? It sounds like Johnny. He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the room with light.
DON CORLEONE: It is Johnny. He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
HAGEN: Should I bring him in.
DON CORLEONE: No. Let the people enjoy him. You see? He is a good godson.
HAGEN: It's been two years. He's probably in trouble again.
KAY: I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
MICHAEL: I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
KAY: I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
MICHAEL: He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career. JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight. They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.
DON CORLEONE: My Godson has come three thousand miles to do us honor and no one thinks to wet his throat. At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.
JOHNNY: I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy. When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
DON CORLEONE: Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
JOHNNY: I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and.my career, I'm almost washed He's very disturbed. The GODFATHER indicates that he come with him to the office so no one will notice. He turns to
DON CORLEONE: Tell Santino to come in with us. He should hear some things. They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.
HAGEN: Then he goes up.
LUCY: Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his body. But there is a knocking as well. They stop, freeze in that position.
HAGEN: The old man wants you; Johnny's here.he's got a problem.
DON CORLEONE: ACT LIKE A MAN! By Christ in Heaven, is it possible you turned out no better than a Hollywood Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing. The DON smiles. SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still adjusting his clothes.
DON CORLEONE: All right, Hollywood.Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
JOHNNY: He owns the studio. Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller. And the main character is a guy just like me. I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself. The DON is silent, stern.
DON CORLEONE: You take care of your family?
JOHNNY: He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as he can.
DON CORLEONE: You look terrible. I want you to eat well, to rest. And spend time with your family. And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
JOHNNY: It's too late. All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
DON CORLEONE: I'll make him an offer he can't He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough to hurt.
DON CORLEONE: Now go back to the party and leave it to me. He closes the door, smiling to himself. Turns to HAGEN.
DON CORLEONE: When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
HAGEN: They'll cut the cake in a few minutes.leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
DON CORLEONE: No, give him a living. But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
HAGEN: I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait. He won't last out the night. This saddens the DON. He sighs.
DON CORLEONE: Genco will wait for me. Santino, tell your brothers they will come with me to the hospital to see Genco. Tell Fredo to drive the big car, and ask Johnny to come with us.
SONNY: And Michael?
DON CORLEONE: All my sons. Tom, I want you to go to California tonight. Make the arrangements. But don't leave until I come back from the hospital and speak to you. EXT DAY: MALL ( SUMMER 1945 ) Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument of his gratitude. The CROWD is favorably impressed: they begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses, in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and kiss the Groom. Louder and louder, five hundred forks hitting five hundred glasses.
HAGEN: EXT DAY: MALL ( SUMMER 1945 ) Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument of his gratitude. The CROWD is favorably impressed: they begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses, in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and kiss the Groom. Louder and louder, five hundred forks hitting five hundred glasses.
DON CORLEONE: Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
MICHAEL: Tom said he'd take care of it. The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through the gate of the great Corleone Mall.
DON CORLEONE: What was this for?
MICHAEL: For bravery.
DON CORLEONE: And this?
MICHAEL: For killing a man.
DON CORLEONE: What miracles you do for strangers.
MICHAEL: I fought for my country. It was my And now, what do you choose to do?
DON CORLEONE: And now, what do you choose to do?
MICHAEL: I'm going to finish school.
DON CORLEONE: Good. When you are finished, come and talk to me. I have hopes for Again they regard each other without a word. MICHAEL turns, and continues on. DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then INT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM ( SUMMER 1945 ) DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR VIEW. He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.
DON CORLEONE: ( whispered ) Genco, I've brought my sons to pay their respects. And look, even Johnny Fontane, all the way from GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man. DON CORLEONE takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.
GENCO: Godfather, Godfather, it's your daughter's wedding day, you cannot refuse me. Cure me, you have the I have no such power.but Genco, don't fear death.
DON CORLEONE: I have no such power.but Genco, don't fear death.
GENCO: ( with a sly wink ) It's been arranged, then?
DON CORLEONE: You blaspheme. Resign yourself.
GENCO: You need your old Consigliere. Who will replace me? Stay with me Godfather. Help me meet death. If he sees you, he will be frightened and leave me in peace. You can say a word, pull a few strings, eh? We'll outwit that bastard as we outwitted all those Godfather, don't betray me. The DON motions all the others to leave the room. They do. He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.
DON CORLEONE: Luca, I am worried about this man Sollozzo. Find out what you can, through the Tattaglias. Let them believe you could be tempted away from the Corleone Family, if the right offer was made. Learn what he has under his fingernails.
SONNY: It's me, Sonny. The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling him into the apartment.
DON CORLEONE: Remember my new Consigliere, a lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns.
WOLTZ: You should have told me your boss was Corleone, Tom, I had to check you out. I thought you were just some third rate hustler Johnny was running in to bluff me. Florence, thirteenth century. Decorated the garden of a king. They cross the garden and head toward the stables.
WOLTZ: I'm going to show you something They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "KHARTOUM." TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they rise as WOLTZ approaches.
WOLTZ: You like horses? I like horses, I love 'em. Beautiful, expensive The animal inside is truly beautiful. WOLTZ whispers to him with true love in his voice.
WOLTZ: Khartoum.Kartoum.You are looking at six hundred thousand dollars on four hoofs. I bet even Russian Czars never paid that kind of dough for a single horse. But I'm not going to race him I'm going to put him out to Stud.
HAGEN: Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
WOLTZ: Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give. But he should try me again on anything else.
HAGEN: He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
WOLTZ: You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
HAGEN: I'm German-Irish.
WOLTZ: Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies. And I'll tell you why. He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges. For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons! Acting lessons! Dancing lessons! We spent hundreds of thousands of dollarsI was going to make her a star. I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents. That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world. Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off. She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous. A MAN IN
SOLLOZZO: My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production. My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss. The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
DON CORLEONE: Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve your generosity?
SOLLOZZO: I need two million dollars in cash.more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences. Be my friend.
DON CORLEONE: What percentages for my family?
SOLLOZZO: Thirty per cent. In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
DON CORLEONE: And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family? SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.
SOLLOZZO: My compliments. I'll take care of them from my share.
DON CORLEONE: So. I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection. No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
SOLLOZZO: If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone. There is a long silence; in which each person present feels the tension. The DON is about to give his answer.
DON CORLEONE: I said I would see you because I've heard you're a serious man, to be treated with respect. But I'll say no to you. We feel this around the room.
DON CORLEONE: I'll give you my reasons. I have many, many friends in Politics. But they wouldn't be so friendly if my business was narcotics instead of gambling. They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice.and they think narcotics is dirty business. SOLLOZZO takes a breath.
DON CORLEONE: No.how a man makes his living is none of my business. But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
SOLLOZZO: Are you worried about security for your million?
DON CORLEONE: The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also. This startles SONNY; he blurts out.
SOLLOZZO: The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also. This startles SONNY; he blurts out.
SONNY: The Tattaglia family guarantees our SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face him. Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out of line.
DON CORLEONE: Young people are greedy, and they have no manners. They speak when they should listen. But I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I've spoiled them, as you see. But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal. He glances one last time at SONNY. He rises; all the others do as well. He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally takes his leave. When the footsteps can no longer be heard: The DON turns to SONNY.
DON CORLEONE: Santino, never let anyone outside the family know what you are thinking. I think your brain is going soft from all that comedy you play with that young girl. TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display with the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers.
DON CORLEONE: What is this nonsense?
HAGEN: It's from Johnny. It was announced this morning. He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers INT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM ( SUMMER 1945 ) It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man, presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping. Soft light bathes the room from the large windows. We move closer to him until we see his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ. He turns uncomfortably; mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets. Something He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet. He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood. He is frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on his sheets and pajamas. He grunts, pulls the puddle of blood in his bed. He feels his own body frantically, moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of his bed. Just blood from the hacked neck. White reedy tendons show. He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle of blood to see more clearly. Froth covers the muzzle, and the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered with blood. WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot. No sound comes out. Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.
DON CORLEONE: Send Johnny my congratulations.
FADE OUT: ( SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED ) FADE IN: EXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE ( WINTER 1945 ) Fifth Avenue in the snow. Christmas week. People are bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents. KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store, carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.
KAY: We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen.
MICHAEL: And what do you want for Christmas?
KAY: Just you. They kiss.
KAY: What will your father say?
MICHAEL: As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object. He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
KAY: What time do they expect us?
MICHAEL: For dinner. Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
KAY: Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night. He moves to the telephone.
MICHAEL: Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night. He moves to the telephone.
KAY: Michael, what are you doing?
MICHAEL: Shhh, you be the long distance operator. Here.
KAY: Hello.this is Long Distance. I have a call from New Hampshire. Mr. Michael Corleone. One moment please. She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.
MICHAEL: Hello, Tom? Michael. Yeah. listen, we haven't left yet. I'm driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow morning. There's something important I want to tell the old man before Christmas. Will he be home tomorrow night?
HAGEN: He smiles. MICHAEL has hung up. He looks at the piles of work, and can't face it. He rises, puts on his coat and hat, and continues out. He peeks into the DON's office.
HAGEN: Michael called; he's not leaving New Hampshire until tomorrow morning. I've got to go, I promised Theresa I'd pick up some toys for the kids. The DON smiles and nods. TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE. FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the afternoon paper. He puts aside the papers the office manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE, raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the Tell Paulie to get the car from the lot; I'll be ready to go home in a few minutes.
DON CORLEONE: Tell Paulie to get the car from the lot; I'll be ready to go home in a few minutes.
FREDO: I'll have to get it myself; Paulie called in sick this morning.
DON CORLEONE: That's the third time this month. I think maybe you'd better get a healthier bodyguard for me. Tell Paulie's a good kid. If he's sick, he's sick. I don't mind getting the car. FREDDIE leaves. He slowly puts on his jacket. Looks out his window.
FREDO: ( going ) Paulie's a good kid. If he's sick, he's sick. I don't mind getting the car. FREDDIE leaves. He slowly puts on his jacket. Looks out his window.
OFFICE MANAGER: Buon Watale, Don Corleone. The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat. Once again, the DON glances out his window. The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.
DON CORLEONE: Merry Christmas. And he starts down the stairs.
SOLLOZZO: ( quietly ) Don't be frightened. I just want to talk to you. A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.
SOLLOZZO: ( urgently ) Get in; I want to talk to you. HAGEN pulls his arm free. He is frightened.
HAGEN: I haven't got time. TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.
SOLLOZZO: Get in the car. If I wanted to kill you you'd be dead already. Trust me. HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story of Hansel and Gretel. We HEAR the car doors shut, and the car drive off.
KAY: Would you like me better if I were a nun?
MICHAEL: Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman? They have passed a little enclosed newsstand. KAY sees something that terrifies her. She doesn't know what to do. MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.
KAY: Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman? They have passed a little enclosed newsstand. KAY sees something that terrifies her. She doesn't know what to do. MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.
KAY: ( a little voice ) I'm thinking about it.
MICHAEL: I'm thinking about it.
KAY: No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman. She cannot answer him. Rather she pulls him by the arm, back to the newsstand, and points. His face goes grave. The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED
MICHAEL: No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman. She cannot answer him. Rather she pulls him by the arm, back to the newsstand, and points. His face goes grave. The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED
DOWN.": MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them. KAY knows to remain silent.
MICHAEL: ( desperately ) They don't say if he's dead or alive.
DON CORLEONE: Fredo, Fredo! The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots. Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain, and continues toward the car. The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking over an entire case of fruit. The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off. Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit. There are more GUNSHOTS. FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car; having difficulty opening the door. He rushes out, a gun trembling in his hand; his mouth open. He actually drops the gun. The gun falls amid the rolling fruit. The GUNMEN are panicked. They fire once more at the downed DON CORLEONE. His leg and arm twitch where they are hit; and pools of blood are beginning to form. The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion; they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came. The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared: rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from windows. But the street itself is now empty. FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and face down in them. FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying something we cannot understand. He begins to weep profusely.
MAN: Luca.I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
LUCA: I know. LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.
SOLLOZZO: Do you know who I am? LUCA Nods.
SOLLOZZO: You've been talking to the Tattaglias. They thought we could do business. LUCA listens.
SOLLOZZO: I need somebody strong to protect my operation, physically. I've heard you're not happy with your family, you might make a switch.
LUCA: If the money is good enough.
SOLLOZZO: On the first shipment, I can guarantee you fifty thousand dollars. LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good. SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it, rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth. BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette. Then, he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.
SONNY: VOICE ( O.S. ) Do you recognize my voice?
SONNY: I think so. Detective squad?
SONNY: Is he alive?
SONNY: Find out anything you can.you got a Grand coming. SONNY cradles the phone. An incredible rage builds up in him, his face actually turning red. He would like to rip the phone to pieces in his bare hands. Then he controls it. Quickly, he dials another number.
SONNY: Theresa, let me talk to Tom. Not yet? Have him call me as soon as he gets home. He hangs up.
SONNY: ( calmly ) They shot the old man.
SANDRA: Oh God.
SONNY: Honey.don't worry. Nothing else is going to happen. There is a POUNDING on the door. A BABY starts crying.
SANDRA: ( really frightened )
SONNY?: SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and moves quickly. He opens the front door quickly. It is CLEMENZA. He enters, SONNY closes the door. SANDRA goes to look after the baby.
CLEMENZA: ( excited ) You heard about your father?
SONNY: The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
CLEMENZA: The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
SONNY: Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
CLEMENZA: Paulie's been a little sick all winter.he was home.
SONNY: How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
CLEMENZA: Maybe three, four times. I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no. Things have been so smooth the last ten Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is. Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
SONNY: Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is. Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
CLEMENZA: That's all? Don't you want me to send some people over here?
SONNY: No, just you and Paulie. CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.
SONNY: A couple of our people will come to stay here. Do whatever they say; I'm going over to the main house. If you want me, use Pop's special The telephone rings again. SONNY answers it.
SONNY: SOLLOZZO ( O.S. ) Santino Corleone? SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is. SONNY indicates that she be quiet.
SONNY: SOLLOZZO ( O.S. ) We have Tom Hagen. In about three hours he'll be released with our proposition. Don't do anything until you've heard what he has to say. You can only cause a lot of trouble. What's done is done. Don't lose that famous temper of I'll wait.
SONNY: ( quietly ) I'll wait.
SONNY: Ma? Ma, where are you. The kitchen door swings open. He moves quickly and takes her by the arm. He is deliberately calm.
SONNY: Ma, I just got a call. Pop's hurt.I don't know how bad.
MAMA: ( quietly ) Santino? Have they killed him?
SONNY: ( almost in tears ) We don't know yet, Ma.
MAMA: I'll get dressed. In case we can see him. She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs. SONNY turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying. He takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil, and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his father's office.
SONNY: Tessio.This is Santino Corleone. I want fifty reliable men out here.
SONNY: I don't want to use Clemenza's people right now. Understood? He hangs up. He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the dial, and removes a small notebook. He takes it back to the desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger. We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA BRASI. SONNY dials the number. There is no answer.
SONNY: INT NITE: BUILDING ( WINTER 1945 ) The interior of an abandoned building. SEVERAL MEN in suits and ties sit around in the booths. HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.
SOLLOZZO: I know you're not in the muscle end of the familyso I don't want you to be afraid. I want you to help the Corleones and I want you to help me. HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette in his mouth. ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered china cup. HAGEN sips gratefully.
SOLLOZZO: Your boss is dead. HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes. SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.
SOLLOZZO: ( pushing the bottle ) Have some more. We got him outside his office, just before I picked you up. You have to make the peace between me and Santino. HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.
SOLLOZZO: Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too. I want you to talk Sonny into it.
HAGEN: ( pulling himself together ) Sonny will come after you with everything he's got. SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.
SOLLOZZO: That's going to be his first reaction. You have to talk some sense into him. The Tattaglia family stands behind me with all their people. The other New York Families will go along with anything that prevents a full scale war. He leans close to HAGEN.
SOLLOZZO: The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him. Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back. Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio.it's good business.
HAGEN: Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
SOLLOZZO: I'll worry about Luca. You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
HAGEN: I'll try.It's what the Don would want us to do.
SOLLOZZO: ( lifting his hands in an expression of harmlessness ) Good.then you can go. ( he escorts him to the door ) I don't like violence. I'm a businessman, and blood is a big He opens the door; they step out together.
SOLLOZZO: The old man is still alive. Five bullets in his Sicilian hide and he's still alive. Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.
MAN: Who're you? ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and then turns.
MAN 2: It's the Don's kid; take the car, I'll bring him inside. The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.
CLEMENZA: Your mother's at the hospital with the old man: He's gonna pull through. MICHAEL nods his relief.
MICHAEL: He moves to THERESA.
MICHAEL: ( gently ) You heard from Tom yet? Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and trembles. Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the room; everyone speaks in a whisper.
MICHAEL: ( taking her hand ) He leads her into his father's office without knocking.
SONNY: Don't worry, Theresa; they just want to give Tom the proposition, then they're going to turn him loose. He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise, he kisses him on the cheek.
SONNY: I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
MICHAEL: How's Mom?
SONNY: Good. She's been through it before. Me too. You were too young to know about it. You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't I can help you out.
MICHAEL: I can help you out.
SONNY: Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
MICHAEL: Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
SONNY: She understands, and leaves them alone.
SONNY: All right, Mikey.who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
MICHAEL: One of them fingered the old man. MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on trial for their lives.
SONNY: One of them fingered the old man. MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on trial for their lives.
MICHAEL: Clemenza? No, I don't believe it.
SONNY: You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
MICHAEL: How can you be sure?
SONNY: On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building. We got people in the phone company. Thank God it was Paulie.we'll need Clemenza bad. MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
MICHAEL: Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
SONNY: Until the old man tells me different.
MICHAEL: Then wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.
SONNY: Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs. I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York. The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt. I don't care if we all go down That's not how Pop would have played it.
MICHAEL: ( softly ) That's not how Pop would have played it.
SONNY: I know I'm not the man he was. But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too. When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
MICHAEL: ( calmly ) All right, Sonny. All right.
SONNY: Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
MICHAEL: Is it like they say? Is he that Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief. Then open the door and rush out. Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped in a tight embrace with his WIFE.
HAGEN: If I plead before the Supreme Court, I'll never do better than I did tonight with that Turk.
HAGEN: Is the hospital covered?
SONNY: The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time. What about the hit HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.
HAGEN: Too much, too far, too personal. The Don would consider this all purely a business dispute: Get rid of Sollozzo, and everything falls in line. YOU don't have to go after the Tattaglias. CLEMENZA nods.
HAGEN: What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca. That worries me.
SONNY: If Luca sold out we're in real Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
HAGEN: Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
SONNY: No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
HAGEN: Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through. Mike, keep ringing Luca's MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the number once again. He can hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one answers. Then hangs up.
HAGEN: Keep trying every fifteen minutes.
SONNY: Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
HAGEN: Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength. Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war. The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore. If your father dies.make the deal, That's easy to say; it's not your I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
SONNY: ( angry ) That's easy to say; it's not your ( quietly ) I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
HAGEN: ( quietly ) I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
SONNY: Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
HAGEN: We're all tired.
SONNY: OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead. But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances. Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city. The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day. There is a timid knock on the door.
SONNY: What is it? PAULIE GATTO looks in.
CLEMENZA: I tol' you to stay put, Paulie.
PAULIE: The guy at the gate's outside.says there's a package.
SONNY: Tessio, see what it is. TESSIO gets up, leaves.
PAULIE: You want me to hang around?
SONNY: Yeah. Hang around.
PAULIE: He closes the door.
CLEMENZA: He closes the door.
PAULIE: He closes the door.
SONNY: Clemenza. You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people. Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show. That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
CLEMENZA: Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people. Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show. That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.

HAGEN: Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly. You know the old man doesn't want that.
SONNY: OK forget it, just stay on the phone. MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected. He dials Luca Brasi's number once again. The ring repeats, but no one TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest in his hand. He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.
CLEMENZA: A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.
BRUNO: ( making an ugly face ) Oh Christ.all over the floor. SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his LUCA falls to the floor.
SOLLOZZO: The Godfather is next.
FADE OUT: FADE IN: EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE ( WINTER 1945 ) Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb. There are rows of pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block. A dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell. This is ROCCO LAMPONE. The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA, talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the side of the house. ROCCO moves to the garage, which is specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work washing a shiny brand new Lincoln. LAMPONE admires the car.
LAMPONE: Crazy Detroit delivered it with a wooden bumper. They're going to send me the chrome bumpers in a couple months. I waited two years for this car to come with wooden He scrubs and polishes with great affection.
CLEMENZA: Crazy Detroit delivered it with a wooden bumper. They're going to send me the chrome bumpers in a couple months. I waited two years for this car to come with wooden He scrubs and polishes with great affection.
CLEMENZA: Today you make your bones on Paulie. You understand everything?
LAMPONE: As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it, unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.
CLEMENZA: .22 soft-nosed load. Accurate up to five feet. LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away. GATTO's car pulls into the driveway, and he sounds the horn. The two men walk to the car. GATTO is driving, a bit nervous, like he doesn't know what is up. LAMPONE gets in the rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of recognition. He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting to chide PAULIE for being late. PAULIE flinches a little when he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:
PAULIE: Rocco, sit on the other side. A big guy like you blocks my rearview CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.
CLEMENZA: Goddamn Sonny. He's running scared. He's already thinking of going to the mattresses. We have to find a place on the West Side. Paulie, you know a good location? PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook he was on. Also there's the money he can make by selling Sollozzo any secret location.
PAULIE: I'll think about it.
CLEMENZA: ( grunting ) Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month! The car pulls out.
CLEMENZA: Pay attention!
PAULIE: Good for ten men.
CLEMENZA: OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found The car pulls off.
CLEMENZA: You wait; I'll call. He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the corner and enters the Luna Restaurant.
CLEMENZA: He talked my ear off. Want us to go back to Long Beach; have another job for us. Rocco, you live in the City, can we drop you off?
CLEMENZA: OK, then you gotta come back. The car pulls out. By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and You think we'll go for that last Maybe, or you gotta know now.
PAULIE: You think we'll go for that last Maybe, or you gotta know now.
CLEMENZA: Maybe, or you gotta know now.
PAULIE: Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
CLEMENZA: Paulie, pull over. I gotta take a The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds. CLEMENZA steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him. He turns his back three quarters from us ( we can no longer see the car ), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting the ground. We wait on this for a moment; and then there are two GUNSHOTS. CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and turns, moving back to the car. PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind him are shattered.
CLEMENZA: Leave the gun. LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few feet where there is another car. They get in, and drive off.
CLEMENZA: Some dame. MICHAEL picks it up.
MICHAEL: Hello. Kay?
MICHAEL: He'll be OK.
MICHAEL: Yeah Kay, I'm here.
MICHAEL: KAY ( O.S. ) Tell me you love me. MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table. He curls up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:
MICHAEL: I can't.
MICHAEL: Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?
CLEMENZA: How come you don't tell that nice girl you love her.here, learn something. you may have to feed fifty guys some day. You start with olive oil.fry some garlic, see. And then fry some sausage.or meat balls if you like.then you throw in the tomatoes, the tomato paste.some basil; and a little red wine.that's my trick. SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.
SONNY: You take care of Paulie?
CLEMENZA: You won't see Paulie anymore. He's sick for good this winter. MICHAEL starts to leave.
SONNY: Where are you going?
MICHAEL: To the city.
SONNY: ( to Clemenza; dipping bread into the sauce ) Send some bodyguards.
MICHAEL: I don't need them, Sonny. I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
CLEMENZA: Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
SONNY: OK, but be careful.
MICHAEL: Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
KAY: Can I go to the hospital with you?
MICHAEL: I don't think so. You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily My parents don't read the Daily News. All right, if you think I shouldn't. I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
KAY: My parents don't read the Daily News. All right, if you think I shouldn't. I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
MICHAEL: I don't think so either. I better go.
KAY: When will I see you again?
MICHAEL: I want you to go back to New Hampshire.think things over. He leans over her; kisses her.
KAY: When will I see you again?
MICHAEL: Quietly, he moves out the door. KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:
KAY: EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL ( WINTER 1945 ) A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with a neon sign "HOSPITALEMERGENCY." MICHAEL steps out, pays the fare.and then stops dead in his tracks. MICHAEL looks. He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted. He is the only one on the street. There are gay, twinkling Christmas decorations all over the building. He walks, slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps. He hesitates, looks around. This area is empty. He checks the address on a scrap of paper. It is correct. He tries the door, it is empty. He walks in.
MICHAEL: Hello? Hello? Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly, alertly. MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all alone. The floors have just been mopped. They are still wet.
NURSE: You're not supposed to be here now. MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.
MICHAEL: I'm Michael Corleonethis is my father. What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
NURSE: Oh your father just had too many visitors. It interfered with the hospital service. The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago. But don't worry. I look in on him.
MICHAEL: You just stand here one minute. Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.
MICHAEL: Sonny.SonnyJesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital. I came down late. There's no one here. None of Tessio's peopleno detectives, no one. The old man is completely All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes. Sit tight, and don't panic.
MICHAEL: ( furiously, but kept inside ) I won't panic. He hangs up; returns to the NURSE.
NURSE: You cannot stay here.I'm sorry.
MICHAEL: ( coldly ) You and I are going to move my father right now.to another room on another floor.Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
NURSE: Absolutely not! We have to get permission from the Doctor.
MICHAEL: You've read about my father in the papers. You've seen that no one's here to guard him. Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him. Believe me and help me.
NURSE: ( frightened ) We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed. She does so.and they perform the very difficult task of moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.
MICHAEL: Hurry, into there. They push it into the first available room. MICHAEL peeks out from the door. The footsteps are louder; then they emerge. It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet of flowers.
MICHAEL: ( stepping out ) Who is it?
ENZO: Michael.do you remember me, Enzo, the baker's helper to Nazorine, now his son-in-law.
MICHAEL: Enzo, get out of here. There's going to be trouble. A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.
ENZO: If there.will be trouble.I stay with you, to help. I owe it to the MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.
MICHAEL: Go outside; stand in front.I'll be out in a minute.
NURSE: ( frightened ) He's awake. MICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he cannot speak. MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.
MICHAEL: Pop.Pop, it's me Michael. Shhhh, don't try to speak. There are men who are coming to try to kill you. But I'm with you.I'm with you The OLD MAN tries to speak.but cannot. MICHAEL tenderly puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.
MICHAEL: Get rid of those and look like you've got a gun in your pocket. The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming. MICHAEL and ENZO look with fear in their eyes. Then MICHAEL takes the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket. They stand, hands in their pockets. A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them. MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive. The car seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates. MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved. MICHAEL looks down; the BAKER's hands are shaking. He looks at his own, and they are not. Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of police sirens. They are clearly coming toward the hospital, getting louder and louder. MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief. In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed POLICE and DETECTIVES. He smiles his relief and starts toward them. TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his arms while ANOTHER frisks him. A massive POLICE CAPTAIN, spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat, with beefy red face and white hair seems furious. This is I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up. Who the hell are you and what are you doing here? ANOTHER COP standing nearby:

MCCLUSKEY: I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up. Who the hell are you and what are you doing here? ANOTHER COP standing nearby:
COP: He's clean, Captain. MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.
MICHAEL: ( quietly ) What happened to the detectives who were supposed to be guarding my ( furious ) You punk-hood. Who the hell are you to tell me my business. I pulled them off. I don't care how many Dago gangsters kill each other. I wouldn't lift a finger to keep your old man from getting knocked off. Now get the hell out of here; get off this street you punk, and stay away from this hospital. MICHAEL stands quiet.
MCCLUSKEY: ( furious ) You punk-hood. Who the hell are you to tell me my business. I pulled them off. I don't care how many Dago gangsters kill each other. I wouldn't lift a finger to keep your old man from getting knocked off. Now get the hell out of here; get off this street you punk, and stay away from this hospital. MICHAEL stands quiet.
MICHAEL: I'll stay until you put guards around my father's room.
MCCLUSKEY: Phil, lock this punk up.
A DETECTIVE: The Kid's clean, Captain.He's a war hero, and he's never been mixed up in the rackets.
MCCLUSKEY: ( furious ) Goddam it, I said lock him up. Put the cuffs on him.
MICHAEL: ( deliberately, right to McCLUSKEY's face, as he's being handcuffed ) How much is the Turk paying you to set my father up, Captain? Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength. MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw. He looks at McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S MEN arrive.
MICHAEL: Christ, Sonny really means business. They continue walking. TESSIO joins them. The various BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.
CLEMENZA: How come all the new men?
TESSIO: We'll need them now. After the hospital incident, Sonny got mad. We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock this morning.
SONNY: I've got a hundred button men on the streets twenty-four hours a day. If Sollozzo shows one hair on his ass he's dead. He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand, Mikey, you look beautiful!
SONNY: Mikey, you look beautiful!
MICHAEL: Cut it out.
SONNY: The Turk wants to talk! The nerve of that son of a bitch! After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
HAGEN: Was there a definite proposal?
SONNY: Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
HAGEN: What about that Tattaglias? What will they do about Bruno?
SONNY: Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
HAGEN: We should hear what they have to say.
SONNY: No, no Consiglere. Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks. Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO. If not, it's all out war. We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
HAGEN: The other families won't sit still for all out war.
SONNY: Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
HAGEN: Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this. This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
SONNY: And when they shot me father.
HAGEN: Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal.
SONNY: No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom. You just help me win. Understood? HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.
HAGEN: I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard. What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable. Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain. Never. It would be disastrous. All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover. So just.take that into consideration.
SONNY: ( still fuming ) McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever. We'll wait.
MICHAEL: We can't wait. No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop. You have to get Sollozzo now.
SONNY: The kid's right.
HAGEN: What about McCluskey?
MICHAEL: Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey. We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
SONNY: Go on Mike.
MICHAEL: They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo. Set up the meeting for two days from now. Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour. So I'll feel safe. They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for Then I'll kill them both. Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL. Silence. SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter. He points a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.
SONNY: You? You, the high-class college kid. You never wanted to get mixed up in the family business. Now you wanta gun down a police Captain and the Turk just because you got slapped in the face. You're taking it personal, it's just business and he's taking it personal. Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps his face serious.
MICHAEL: ( angrily, but cold ) Sonny, it's all personal, and I learned it from him, the old man, the Godfather. He took my joining the Marines personal. I take Sollozzo trying to kill my father personal, and you know I'll kill them Sonny. MICHAEL radiates danger.SONNY stops laughing.
CLEMENZA: Just let your hand drop to your side, and let the gun slip out. Everybody will still think you got it. They'll be starin' at your face, see? Then walk out of the place real fast, but don't run. Don't look anybody directly in the eye, but don't look away from them neither. Hey, they'll be scared stiff o you, believe me. Nobody's gonna bother with you. Don't worry about nothing; you'd be surprised how good these things go. O.K., put your hat on, let's see how you look. Helps with identification. They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.
CLEMENZA: Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light. Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
MICHAEL: How bad will it be?
CLEMENZA: Probably all the other families will line up against us. But, it's alright. These things have to happen once every ten years or so.gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble.
MICHAEL: Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
SONNY: What are you, inspecting the You ready? Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
MICHAEL: A million times.
SONNY: Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
HAGEN: We don't let Mike go until we have the hostage, Sonny.
CLEMENZA: It's okay.the hostage is outside playing pinochle with three of my The phone rings in the DON's office.
SONNY: That could be a Tattaglia informer with the meeting place.
SONNY: One of Tattaglia's people?
HAGEN: No. Our informer in McCluskey's precinct. Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx. Anyone know it.
TESSIO: Sure, I do. It's perfect for us. A small family place with big booths where people can talk in private. Good food. Everybody minds their business. Perfect. This is the entrance, Mike. When you finish just walk out and turn left, then turn the corner. Clemenza, you gotta work fast to plant the gun. They got an old- fashioned toilet with a space between the water container and the wall. We can tape the gun behind Mike, they're gonna frisk you in the car. You'll be clean so they won't worry 'bout nothing. In the restaurant, wait and talk a while, and then ask permission to go. See? Then when you come out, don't waste time; don't sit down.you come out blasting. And don't take chances. In the head, two shots apiece. And out as fast as your legs can move.
CLEMENZA: Mike, they're gonna frisk you in the car. You'll be clean so they won't worry 'bout nothing. In the restaurant, wait and talk a while, and then ask permission to go. See? Then when you come out, don't waste time; don't sit down.you come out blasting. And don't take chances. In the head, two shots apiece. And out as fast as your legs can move.
SONNY: I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his The gun will be there.
CLEMENZA: The gun will be there.
SONNY: ( to MICHAEL, warmly ) You're on, kid.I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left. And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
CLEMENZA: We gotta move.
MICHAEL: O.K. How long do you think before I can come back?
SONNY: Probably a year.
HAGEN: ( starting to crack ) Jesus, I don't know.
SONNY: Can you do it Mike? MICHAEL moves out.
DRIVER: Get in, Mike. He does, the car drives off.
SOLLOZZO: I'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we can straighten everything out. All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
MICHAEL: I want to settle things tonight. I want my father left alone.
SOLLOZZO: He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be. Just keep an open mind when we talk. I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny. It's impossible to talk business with him. McCLUSKEY grunts.
MCCLUSKEY: He's a good kid. He's all right. Turn around, up on your knees, facing me. He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.
MCCLUSKEY: I'm sorry about the other night Mike. I'm getting too old for my job, too grouchy. Can't stand the aggravation. You know how it is. He's clean.
MICHAEL: We're going to New Jersey?
SOLLOZZO: ( sly ) MICHAEL closes his eyes.
SOLLOZZO: Nice work; I'll remember it. MICHAEL is relieved.
MCCLUSKEY: Is the Italian food good here?
SOLLOZZO: Try the veal; it's the finest in New York. The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table. They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three glasses. Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:
SOLLOZZO: I am going to talk Italian to Mike.
MCCLUSKEY: Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll concentrate on my veal and my SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian. MICHAEL listening carefully and nodding every so often. Then MICHAEL answers in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on. The WAITER occasionally brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on. Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in Italian, accidentally lapses into English.
MICHAEL: ( using English for emphasis ) Most important.I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
SOLLOZZO: What guarantees can I give you? I am the hunted one. I've missed my chance. You think too highly of me, my friend.I am not so clever.all I want if a truce. MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling holding his open hands up as if to say: "I have no tricks up my sleeve". Then he looks away and makes a distressed look on his face.
SOLLOZZO: What is it?
MICHAEL: Is it all right if I go to the SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious. He studies MICHAEL with his dark eyes. Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.
MCCLUSKEY: I frisked him; I've frisked thousands of young punks; he's clean. He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them; indicating the bathroom with his eyes. The MAN nods, indicating no one is there.
SOLLOZZO: Don't take too long. MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and disappears inside.
MICHAEL: Now I can talk. I feel much better. The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now he too relaxes. SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton his jacket. SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his temple. He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the entire area. The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is sprayed and stained with blood. SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he seems to hang in space suspended. MICHAEL pivots, and looks: There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal suspended in air before his gaping mouth. MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging throat. He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound. Then coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull. The air is filled with pink mist. MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall. He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed. Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty. The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an expression of horror on his face. MICHAEL looks at his two victims: SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by the table. McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table. MICHAEL is wildly at a peak. He starts to move out. His hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN. He moves, not letting the gun go. MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression. His hand: still holding the gun. His face: finally he closes his eyes. His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud. He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back. He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had been recreated in wax. Then he leaves.
MAN: Nice Augie.nice.
DRIVER: Pick up your sister?
SONNY: The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the bodyguards in their cars.
CONNIE'S VOICE: Who is it?
SONNY: It's me, Sonny. We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open. SONNY enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her back to him.
SONNY: ( tenderly ) Connie, what is it? He turns her around in his arms. Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time. As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red with rage. She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing him from running out of the apartment.
CONNIE: ( desperately ) It was my fault! I started a fight with him and I tried to hit him so he hit me. He didn't even try to hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it. Sonny listens, and calms himself. He touches her shoulder, the thin silk robe.
SONNY: I'm goin' to have the doctor come over and take a look at you. He starts to leave.
CONNIE: Oh Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't. He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.
SONNY: Hey. Con. What'm I goin' to do? Make your kid a orphan before he's She laughs with him. He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.
SONNY: You.bastard.You.hurt my sister. again.and I'll He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly. and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone, leaving even his bodyguards in confusion. We notice ONE MAN with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands. He slumps onto the stoop.
HAGEN: Kay, we weren't expecting you. You should call.
KAY: I've tried calling and writing. I want to reach Michael.
HAGEN: Nobody knows where he is. We know he's all right, but that's all. KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with What was that?
KAY: What was that?
HAGEN: An accident. No one was hurt.
KAY: Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one? TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has Sure.I'm sorry. They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.
HAGEN: Sure.I'm sorry. They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.
KAY: Will you give this to him.
HAGEN: If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you. We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.
MAMA: You're Mikey's little girl. KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.
MAMA: You eat anything? KAY shakes her head.
MAMA: ( to HAGEN ) Disgrazia, you don't even give the poor girl a cup of coffee? HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves toward MAMA, the letter extended.
KAY: Will you give this letter to Michael.
HAGEN: Mama, no.
MAMA: You tell me what to do? Even he don't tell me what to do. She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.
KAY: Why did they blame Michael?
MAMA: You listen to me, you go home to your family, and you find a good young man and get married. Forget about Mikey; he's no good for you, She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what that means.
CONNIE: What's the matter, Carlo?
CARLO: Shut up.
HAGEN: .since McCluskey's killing, the police have cracked down on most of our operations.on the other families too. There's been a lot of bad blood. The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.
SONNY: Pop, they hit us and we hit them We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers.about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets.things are starting to loosen up. The OLD MAN nods.
HAGEN: We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers.about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets.things are starting to loosen up. The OLD MAN nods.
SONNY: Freddie's gonna go to Las Vegas.under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A. I want him to I'm goin' to learn the casino The DON nods approvingly. Then he searches around the room for a face he does not see. HAGEN knows who he's looking for.
FREDO: I'm goin' to learn the casino The DON nods approvingly. Then he searches around the room for a face he does not see. HAGEN knows who he's looking for.
HAGEN: ( he takes a breath ) It was Michael who killed Sollozzo. The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and He's safe now.we're already working on ways to bring him back. The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they leave him alone.
HAGEN: He's safe now.we're already working on ways to bring him back. The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they leave him alone.
SONNY: We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks. I want to get things going good before he gets better. What's the matter with you?
HAGEN: You start operating, the five families will start their raids again. We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom and they're scared of me.
SONNY: No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom and they're scared of me.
HAGEN: Yes. That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
SONNY: Well it's war! We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian. Pop had Genco, who do I have? Hey Tom, hey.hey. It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner. Don't be INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM ( SPRING 1946 ) The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table over Sunday dinner. SONNY is at the head of the table.
CONNIE: Who is this?
CONNIE: You lousy tramp bitch. She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the bathroom drying his golden body.
CARLO: What was that?
CONNIE: Your girl friend. She says she can't make it tonight. You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard! She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy belly heaving under the thin slip.
CARLO: ( defending himself ) You're crazy. She was kidding around; I don't know, some nut. He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue You're staying home. You're not going out.
CONNIE: You're staying home. You're not going out.
CARLO: OK, OK. You gonna make me something to eat at least? That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and starts her wifely duties. CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in the doorway.
CONNIE: The food is on the table.
CARLO: I'm not hungry yet.
CONNIE: Eat it, it's on the table.
CARLO: Ba Fa Goulle.
CONNIE: BA FA GOULE YOU! She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen. A moment later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking. CARLO slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.
CARLO: You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head Like hell I will. She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again. Slowly, he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in his hand.
CONNIE: Like hell I will. She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again. Slowly, he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in his hand.
CARLO: Clean it up! He swings the belt against her heavy hips. She moves back into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it Even the female Corleones are He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her. She makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids. He pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process. She gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table, gets her; and starts to slap her in the face. She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.
CARLO: Even the female Corleones are He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her. She makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids. He pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process. She gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table, gets her; and starts to slap her in the face. She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.
CONNIE: The baby! The baby!
CARLO: You're fat as a pig. Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving her in tears. She is crying; she pulls herself to the bedroom phone, and in a whisper:
CONNIE: Mama.mama, it's Connie. Mama, I can't talk any louder. No, I don't want to talk to Sonny. We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.
SONNY: Yeah Connie.
SONNY: ( in a controlled voice ) You wait there. You just wait there. He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.
SONNY: ( quietly ) That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch. HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he cannot interfere.
HAGEN: Go after him.
BONASERA: Yes, I understand. I'm listening.
BONASERA: Anything.Anything the Godfather Good. He never doubted you.
BONASERA: The Don himself is coming to me BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room. Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing. His WIFE knows something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes from him. He lights a cigarette.
BONASERA: For the last year, they have been killing one another. So now, what? Your Godfather comes to me.Why? They've killed someone so important that they wish to make his body They could make me an accomplice to their murder. They could send me to jail! He slips into his trousers. Then he moves to his WIFE to tie his tie, as she has done for years.
MRS. BONASERA: ( frightened ) They could make me an accomplice to their murder. They could send me to jail! He slips into his trousers. Then he moves to his WIFE to tie his tie, as she has done for years.
BONASERA: They could make me an accomplice to their murder. They could send me to jail! He slips into his trousers. Then he moves to his WIFE to tie his tie, as she has done for years.
BONASERA: And if the other families find out.they will make me their enemy. They could come here to our house. I curse the day I ever went to the EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ( SPRING 1946 ) With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.
DON CORLEONE: Well my friend, are you ready to do me this service? BONASERA nods. The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.
BONASERA: What do you wish me to do?
DON CORLEONE: ( staring at the table ) I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me. I do not want his mother to see him as he is. He draws down the gray blanket. BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees: The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.
HAGEN: ( quietly ) OK. Go to Clemenza's house and tell him to come here right away. He'll tell you what to do. The MEN leave him alone. He is quiet, standing in the middle of the living room a moment. He looks in the direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA moving around.
DON CORLEONE: Give me a drop of anisette. HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.
DON CORLEONE: My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight. So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
HAGEN: ( quietly ) I didn't tell Mama anything. I was about to come up and wake you and tell you. Just now.
DON CORLEONE: But you needed a drink first.
HAGEN: DON CORLEONE Now you've had your drink. They shot Sonny on the Causeway. He's dead. DON CORLEONE blinks. One feels that just for a second he loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.
DON CORLEONE: Now you've had your drink. They shot Sonny on the Causeway. He's dead. DON CORLEONE blinks. One feels that just for a second he loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.
HAGEN: They shot Sonny on the Causeway. He's dead. DON CORLEONE blinks. One feels that just for a second he loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.
DON CORLEONE: I want no inquiries made. No acts of vengeance. Consigliere, arrange a meeting with the heads of the five families.this war stops now. He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns.
DON CORLEONE: Call Bonasera.he will do me a And leaves. HAGEN moves to the phone; dials.
HAGEN: This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
HAGEN: You owe the Don a service. He has no doubt that you will repay it.
DON CORLEONE: Ah well, let's get down to business. We are all honorable men here, we don't have to give assurances as if we were lawyers. How did things ever go so far? Well, no matter. A lot of foolishness has come to pass. It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary. The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks. A large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times, and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during the day's trading, and projected above. DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.
DON CORLEONE: Tattaglia has lost a son; I have lost a son. We are quits. Let there be a peace. That is all I want.
BARZINI: Don Corleone is too modest. He had the judges and politicians in his pocket and he refused to share them. His refusal is not the act of a friend. He takes the bread out of the mouths of our families. Times have changed, it's not like the old days where everyone can go his own way. If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians in New York, then he must share them or let others use them. Certainly he can present a bill for such services, we're not Communists, after all. But he has to let us draw water from the well. It's that simple.
DON CORLEONE: My friends, I didn't refuse out of malice. You all know me. When have I ever refused an accommodation? But why, this time? Because I think this drug business will destroy us in the years to come. It's not like whiskey or gambling or even women which most people want and is forbidden them by the pezzonovante of the Church and the Government. But drugs? No. Even policemen, who help us in gambling and other things would refuse to help us in drugs. But.I am willing to do whatever all of you think is necessary.
DON ZALUCHI: I don't believe in drugs. For years I paid my people extra so they wouldn't do that kind of business.$200 a week. But it didn't matter. Somebody comes to them and says, "I have powders, if you put up three, four thousand dollar investment, we can make fifty thousand distributing." Who can resist such a profit? There's no way to control it, as a business.to keep it respectable. I don't want it near schools! I don't want it sold to children. That is an infamita. In my city I would try to keep the traffic in the dark people, the colored. They are the best customers, the least troublesome, and they are animals anyway. They have no respect for their wives or their families or themselves. Let them lose their souls with drugs. But something has to be done, we can't have everybody running around doing just what they please, like a bunch of anarchists.
BARZINI: Then, are we agreed; the traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled; and Don Corleone agrees to give it protection in the East. DON CORLEONE nods.
BARZINI: That's the whole matter then, we have the peace, and let me pay my respects to Don Corleone, whom we have all known over the years as a man of his word. Don Philip?
TATTAGLIA: I agree to everything here, I'm willing to forget my own misfortune. But I must hear strict assurance from Corleone. When time goes by and his position becomes stronger, will he attempt any individual They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something else in mind. Slowly the DON rises.
DON CORLEONE: I forego my vengeance for my dead son, for the common good. But I have selfish reasons. My youngest son had to flee, accused of Sollozzo's murder, and I must now make arrangements so that he can come home with safety, cleared of all those false charges. That is my affair, and I will make those But I am a superstitious man.and so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, or if he should hang himself in his cell, or if my son is struck by a bolt of lightning, then I will blame some of the people here. That, I could never forgive, but.aside from that, let me swear by the souls of my Grandchildren that I will never be the one to break the peace we have EXT NITE: DON'S LIMO ( SPRING 1946 ) The DON's black limousine. He sits quietly in the padded rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him. It is night. Lights flash by them every so often.
HAGEN: When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
DON CORLEONE: Mention it, don't insist. Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
HAGEN: You mean Tattaglia.
DON CORLEONE: ( shaking his head ) ( a revelation ) He was the one behind Sollozzo?
HAGEN: ( a revelation ) He was the one behind Sollozzo?
DON CORLEONE: Tattaglia is a pimp. He could never have outfought Santino. But I wasn't sure until this day. No, it was Barzini all along. The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.
FADE OUT: FADE IN: EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left grotesque and misshapen. GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets. THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable, and with a pleasing build. Each of the SHEPHERDS carry The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape, overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.
MICHAEL: Don Tommassino.
DON TOMMASSINO: Michael, why must you do this. We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret. It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
MICHAEL: Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
DON TOMMASSINO: You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in I know.
MICHAEL: I know.
DON TOMMASSINO: Where are you going?
MICHAEL: DON TOMMASSINO There is nothing there. Not anymore.
DON TOMMASSINO: There is nothing there. Not anymore.
MICHAEL: I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
DON TOMMASSINO: Long ago. Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas.the others escaped to Don Tommassino.I should see this DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.
MICHAEL: Don Tommassino.I should see this DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.
DON TOMMASSINO: That is your birthright.but Michael, use this car.
MICHAEL: No.I would like to walk to The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.
DON TOMMASSINO: Be careful Michael, don't let them know your name. The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues on his journey.
FABRIZZIO: You tell us about America.
MICHAEL: How do you know I come from America?
FABRIZZIO: We hear. We were told you were a Pezzonovanta.big shot.
MICHAEL: Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
FABRIZZIO: Hey America! Is she as rich as they say?
MICHAEL: Take me to America! You need a good lupara in America? You take me, I'll be the best man you got. "Oh say, can you seeee.By da star early light." MICHAEL laughs.
FABRIZZIO: Take me to America! You need a good lupara in America? You take me, I'll be the best man you got. "Oh say, can you seeee.By da star early light." MICHAEL laughs.
FABRIZZIO: Hey America! Take me with you! Hey, take me to America G.I.!
CALO: They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.
CALO: The names of the dead. MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street. He looks. The street is empty, barren. Occasionally, an old woman will pass. MICHAEL turns his head. The other side of the street: empty and deathly. A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.
FABRIZZIO: ( calling out to them ) Hey, beautiful girls!
MICHAEL: ( sternly ) He settles down to watch. The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that cling to their bodies. They are still in their teens, but developed and womanly. They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove. Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them playfully, in the direction of the grove. The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws them back at her pursuers laughing. They come closer and closer. Just short of the grove, she poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the view of the THREE MEN. She stands there on her toes about to run. MICHAEL sees her; now face to face. He looks. Her face. Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair and a rich mouth.
FABRIZZIO: ( murmuring ) Jesus Christ, take my soul. I'm Quickly, she turns, and runs away. MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her. We hold on him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS laughing. Then he turns to them.
FABRIZZIO: You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh? CALO pats him on the shoulder.
CALO: Easy man.
MICHAEL: What are you talking about?
FABRIZZIO: You can't hide it when you're hit by the thunderbolt.
FABRIZZIO: You know all the girls in this town, eh? We saw some beauties coming down the road. One in particular got our friend hit with the Thunderbolt. VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with new interest.
VITELLI: You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight.
FABRIZZIO: This one could seduce the devil. A body! and eyes as big and black as I know about what you mean!
VITELLI: ( laughing with them.pouring more wine ) I know about what you mean!
FABRIZZIO: This was a beauty. Right, Calo?
VITELLI: ( laughing ) Beautiful all over, eh?
FABRIZZIO: And hair. Black and curly, like a doll. And such a mouth. VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.
VITELLI: Yes, we have beautiful girls here. but virtuous. VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.
MICHAEL: She wore a red dress, and a red ribbon in her hair. She looks more Greek than Italian. Do you know a beauty like that? As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less, until he wears a scowl.
VITELLI: Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.
FABRIZZIO: God in Heaven, I think I He goes into the back room after the innkeeper. Then he Let's get out of here; he's boiling up his blood to do us mischief. It's his daughter. They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.
FABRIZZIO: Let's get out of here; he's boiling up his blood to do us mischief. It's his daughter. They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.
CALO: Come quickly.
MICHAEL: Innkeeper. More wine!
FABRIZZIO: ( whispered ) The old bastard mentioned two sons he only has to whistle up. MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.
MICHAEL: Tell him to come to me. The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI between them.
MICHAEL: ( quietly ) I understand I've offended you by talking about your daughter. I offer you my apologies, I'm a stranger in this country, I don't know the customs very well. Let me say this, I meant no disrespect to you or her. CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.
VITELLI: ( shrugs ) Who are you and what do you want from my daughter?
MICHAEL: I am an American hiding in Sicily from the police of my country. My name is Michael. You can inform the police and make your fortune but then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband. In any case, I want to meet your daughter. With your permission and under the supervision of your family. With all decorum. With all respect. I am an honorable man. CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then Are you a friend of the friends?
VITELLI: Are you a friend of the friends?
MICHAEL: When the proper time comes, I'll tell you everything that a wife's father should know.
FABRIZZIO: It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
VITELLI: ( formally ) Come Sunday morning: My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
MICHAEL: Your daughter's name?
VITELLI: -FADE OUT- EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an Alfa Romeo. CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their luparas on their shoulders. DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off, rocky and bouncing on the dirt road. The Sunday churchbells ring.
DISSOLVE: EXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by the yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS. Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate Sunday clothing. Now he presents the wrapped gift to APPOLONIA. She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives her permission to open it. She unwraps it. Her eyes light at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace. She looks at him.
APPOLONIA: EXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS, though they are all dressed differently. They go up to the cafe.and sit with VITELLI, who is talking and talking. MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet. She wears the gold necklace around her neck.

They go up to the cafe.and sit with VITELLI, who is talking and talking. MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet. She wears the gold necklace around her neck.
DISSOLVE: EXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path, seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart. As the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a half dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces further behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on their shoulders. Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone, and falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm. She modestly regains her balance, and they continue walking. Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.
DISSOLVE: EXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out. Music, old and dissonant, plays. There is a bridal procession in the street of the village; the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five hundred years ago. Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police. We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in APPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.
DISSOLVE: EXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE CALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the great wedding celebration. It is held in the Village Square; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the tops of buildings, carrying luparas.
DISSOLVE: INT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA MICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight fills the room. He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA. A little frightened; but lovely. He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her, looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body. Slowly and tenderly he kisses her. Her tiny hands come up to his face; touch his cheek and embrace him. She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.
FADE OUT: INT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA Morning. MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the APPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially covered by the bedsheets. He looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.
MICHAEL: It's safer to teach you English.
APPOLONIA: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.See, I learned it. Now teach me to drive! DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard. He seems tired and Ciao, Don Tommassino. APPOLONIA kisses him.
MICHAEL: Ciao, Don Tommassino. APPOLONIA kisses him.
MICHAEL: Things went badly in Palermo?
DON TOMMASSINO: The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen. Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
MICHAEL: Is that why there are more men on the walls?
DON TOMMASSINO: Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore. I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
MICHAEL: What is it?
DON TOMMASSINO: Bad news from America. Your brother, Santino. He has been For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.
MICHAEL: Get the car. I'll be leaving in ten minutes. Where's Calo?
FABRIZZIO: Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen. Is your wife coming with you?
MICHAEL: No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks.
CALO: Should I get your bag?
MICHAEL: No, I'll get it. Where's Appolonia?
CALO: ( smiling ) She is sitting in the driver's seat of the car, dying to step on the gas. She'll be a real American woman before she gets to America. MICHAEL smiles.
MICHAEL: Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in the car. He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee. He looks out from the opening in the doorway.
MICHAEL: ( muttering to himself ) Where the hell is he going? MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside. MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes. APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay where he is.
APPOLONIA: ( calling out ) I'll drive to you. He smiles affectionately. CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling by his side. There is no sight of FABRIZZIO. Suddenly the smile fades from MICHAEL's face. He steps forward and holds out his hand.
MICHAEL: No. No! His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION, as she switched on the ignition. Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off; and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia. MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.
MICHAEL: Fabrizzio. Let your shepherds know that the one who gives me Fabrizzio will own the finest pastures in FADE OUT FADE IN: EXT DAY: MALL ( SPRING 1951 ) A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime. Hordes of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets, searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden Easter eggs. The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants. Suddenly, he stops and looks. MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase. Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in MICHAEL's direction. MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son and embraces him.

DON CORLEONE: Be my son.
DON CORLEONE: This old building has seen its day. No way to do business.too small, too old. They enter the DON's glass-panelled office.
DON CORLEONE: Have you thought about a wife? A I understand, Michael. But you must make a family, you know.
MICHAEL: ( pained ) DON CORLEONE I understand, Michael. But you must make a family, you know.
DON CORLEONE: I understand, Michael. But you must make a family, you know.
MICHAEL: I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
DON CORLEONE: Accept what's happened, Michael.
MICHAEL: I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice. From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
DON CORLEONE: No, I wanted other things for you.
MICHAEL: You wanted me to be your son.
DON CORLEONE: Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians.and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
MICHAEL: Then why have I become a man like You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men. I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over. That was my misfortune. That was your misfortune. I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was. I had no choice.

That was your misfortune. I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was. I had no choice.
MICHAEL: A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
DON CORLEONE: What else do you believe in? MICHAEL doesn't answer.
DON CORLEONE: Believe in a family. Can you believe in your country? Those Pezzonovante of the State who decide what we shall do with our lives? Who declare wars they wish us to fight in to protect what they own. Do you put your fate in the hands of men whose only talent is that they tricked a bloc of people to vote for them? Michael, in five years the Corleone family can be completely legitimate. Very difficult things have to happen to make that possible. I can't do them anymore, but you can, if you choose to. MICHAEL listens.
DON CORLEONE: Believe in a family; believe in a Code of Honor, older and higher, believe in Roots that go back thousands of years into your Race. Make a family, Michael, and protect it. These are our affairs, sono cosa nostra, Governments only protect men who have their own individual power. Be one of those men.you have the choice.
FADE OUT: EXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS ( 1955 ) A MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.
MICHAEL: Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner. From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a INT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE ( 1955 ) A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI. Great fuss is made. They are being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.
FREDO: He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner. From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a INT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE ( 1955 ) A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI. Great fuss is made. They are being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.
FREDO: You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful. That doctor did some job on your face.
MICHAEL: You look good, too. They enter the suite.
FREDO: Nice, eh? FREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the bellboys, waiters and maids.
FREDO: ( hurrying into the bedroom ) Kid, take a look-see. MICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom. There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform, mirrors to each side. FREDO points upward. A VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.
FREDO: Ever seen anything like that before?
MICHAEL: ( dryly ) INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM ( 1955 ) MICHAEL is alone in the bedroom. He is just finishing dressing; he puts on his jacket. From the window, with the lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night. MICHAEL passes into the other room. He stops, looks. He is disturbed.
FREDO: Mike! The party starting!
MICHAEL: Come here a minute, Fredo. FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.
MICHAEL: Who are those girls?
FREDO: ( jokingly ) That's for you to find out.
MICHAEL: Give them some money and send them Get rid of them.
FREDO: Get rid of them.
MICHAEL: Get rid of them.
MICHAEL: Johnny, the Corleone family is thinking of selling out all our interests in the Olive Oil business and settling here. Moe Greene will sell us his interest so it can be wholly owned by friends of the FREDDIE seems anxious.
FREDO: Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
MICHAEL: I'll make him an offer he can't MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.
MICHAEL: Johnny, the Don wants you to help us get started. We figure entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers. We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week long engagement. We hope your friends in the movies will do the same. We count on you to convince them.
JOHNNY: Sure, I'll do anything for my Godfather. You know that, Mike. There is knock on the door. NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL, who nods. NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters, followed by TWO BODYGUARDS. He is a handsome hood, dressed in the Hollywood style. His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast Mike, good to see you. Got everything you want?
MOE: Mike, good to see you. Got everything you want?
MICHAEL: The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good! Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
MOE: The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good! Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
MICHAEL: Is my credit good enough to buy you MOE laughs.
MOE: Buy me out?.
MICHAEL: The hotel, the casino. The Corleone family wants to buy you out. GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense. NERI eyes the BODYGUARDS.
MOE: ( furious ) The Corleone family wants to buy me out. I buy you out. You don't buy me out.
MICHAEL: Your casino loses money. Maybe we can do better.
MOE: You think I scam?
MICHAEL: ( the worst insult ) You're unlucky.
MOE: You goddamn dagos. I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
MICHAEL: You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino. You and the Corleone family are evened out. This is for business; name your price.
MOE: The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore. The Godfather is sick. You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here. I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
MICHAEL: ( quietly, deadly ) Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
FREDO: ( his face turns red ) Ah Mike, that was nothing. Moe didn't mean anything. He flies off the handle sometimes; but me and him are good friends. Right, Moe?
MOE: Yeah sure. Sometimes I gotta kick asses to make this place run right. Freddie and I had a little argument and I had to straighten him out.
MICHAEL: You straightened my brother out?
MOE: Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time. Players couldn't get a drink. MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:
MICHAEL: I have to go back to New York tomorrow. Think of your price.
MOE: You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that? I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
FREDO: ( frightened ) Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
MICHAEL: The Don has semi-retired. I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me. Nobody answers. MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door. MOE exits angrily.
MICHAEL: Freddie, you're my older brother. I love you. But don't ever take sides with anybody against the Family again.
MICHAEL: I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
KAY: Oh Michael.
MICHAEL: We'll go to the show tomorrow nightwe can change the tickets.
KAY: Don't you want dinner first?
MICHAEL: No, you eat.don't wait up for me.
KAY: Wake me up when you come to bed? The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding limousine window.
KAY: Your sister wants to ask you Let HER ask. NERI opens the door. KAY wants to talk just a little more.
MICHAEL: Let HER ask. NERI opens the door. KAY wants to talk just a little more.
KAY: She's afraid to. Michael. MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment Why are you so cold to her and Carlo? They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
KAY: Why are you so cold to her and Carlo? They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
MICHAEL: I'm busy.
KAY: Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy. NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too. He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.
KAY: Will you?
MICHAEL: Let me think about it, O.K.? She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY and the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.
TESSIO: I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
CLEMENZA: You said there would come a day when Tessio and me could form our own Families. Only with your benediction, of course. I ask My son is head of the Family now. If you have his permission, you have my good will.
DON CORLEONE: My son is head of the Family now. If you have his permission, you have my good will.
MICHAEL: In six months you can break off from the Corleone Family and go on your own. Carlo, I'm counting on you to make the move to Nevada; you'll be my right-hand man out there. Tom Hagen is no longer the Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction. He remains inexpressive.
MICHAEL: He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas. Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute. No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it. Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
CLEMENZA: Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
MICHAEL: Maybe less.
TESSIO: Let us fill up our Regimes.
MICHAEL: No. I want things very calm for another six months.
TESSIO: Forgive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up? The two go hand in hand. And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us.
CLEMENZA: And I don't like Barzini. I say the Corleone Family has to move from strength, not weakness. We should build our Regimes and take back our lost territories in Staten Island, at least.
DON CORLEONE: Do you have faith in my judgement?
CLEMENZA: Yes, Godfather.
DON CORLEONE: Then do what Michael says.
MICHAEL: All I can say is that things are being resolved that are more effective than a thousand buttonmen on the streets. Understood? There are uneasy looks all around.
CARLO: Understood. I just wish I was doing more to help out.
MICHAEL: I'll come to you when I need you. He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN. They all nod, All right, then it's resolved. NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door. CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave, then CARLO. NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man. Then NERI closes the door. MICHAEL relaxes.
MICHAEL: All right, then it's resolved. NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door. CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave, then CARLO. NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man. Then NERI closes the door. MICHAEL relaxes.
HAGEN: Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
MICHAEL: Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man. What could be more important than that.
HAGEN: I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime. Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
DON CORLEONE: I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
MICHAEL: How did you find out?
HAGEN: Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing. They get a little more money than the job's worth. Lampone's a good man; he's operating Not so perfectly if you noticed.
MICHAEL: Not so perfectly if you noticed.
HAGEN: Mike, why am I out?
MICHAEL: You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
HAGEN: OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness. Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones.
DON CORLEONE: Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace. He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune. Michael has all my confidence, as you do. For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
HAGEN: Maybe I can help.
MICHAEL: ( coldly ) You're out, Tom. TOM pauses, thinks.and then he nods in acquiescence. TOM MICHAEL looks at NERI.
MICHAEL: I'm going to talk to my father. NERI nods, and then leaves. The DON opens the doors, breathes in the air, and steps outside.
DON CORLEONE: I see you have your Luca Brasi.
MICHAEL: I'll need him.
DON CORLEONE: There are men in this world who demand to be killed. They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me." Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it.I made him my weapon. Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him. I think you have done the same with this man. They walk through the DON's vegetable garden. Tomatoes, peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting. MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him. Then stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.
DON CORLEONE: Barzini will move against you first.
MICHAEL: DON CORLEONE He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust. That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety. He rises, and looks at Michael.
DON CORLEONE: He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust. That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety. He rises, and looks at Michael.
DON CORLEONE: .and at that meeting you will be The DON walks on further.
DON CORLEONE: Your wife and children.you're happy with them?
MICHAEL: DON CORLEONE MICHAEL wants to express something.hesitates, then:
DON CORLEONE: MICHAEL wants to express something.hesitates, then:
MICHAEL: I've always respected you. A long silence. The DON smiles at MICHAEL.
DON CORLEONE: And I.you.
KAY: How is your husband feeling?
MAMA: He's not the same since they shot him. He lets Michael do all the work. He just plays the fool with his garden, his peppers, his tomatoes, as if he was some peasant still. But men are like that. She stops toward the Church.
MAMA: You come in, too. KAY shakes her head.
MAMA: The Priest ain't gonna bite you cause you're not Catholic. He's in the back drinkin' his wine. KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church. They enter.
MAMA: You can. Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and blesses herself. Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally the Altar. MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles. There is a large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles. MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives her some. MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights twenty candles. She finishes, and bows her head.
GIRL: Do you remember me?
TESSIO: We danced together at Connie's TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown', and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael. He finds him.

TESSIO: Mike, could I have a minute? MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place. NERI is close Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
TESSIO: Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
MICHAEL: He talked to you?
TESSIO: ( nods ) I can arrange security. MICHAEL looks at him.
MICHAEL: ( softly ) Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him. I really needed him.
HAGEN: Did he give you his politicians?
MICHAEL: Not all.I needed another four months and I would have had them I guess you've figured it all out?
HAGEN: How will they come at you?
MICHAEL: I know now. I'll make them call me Don.
HAGEN: Have you agreed on a meeting?
MICHAEL: ( nods ) A week from tonight. In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be HAGEN looks at him; understands.
MICHAEL: But after the Baptism. I've decided to stand as godfather to Connie's baby. They look up. The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel, with the bold inscription: CORLEONE.
PRIEST: ( to MICHAEL ) Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
MICHAEL: Yes, I promise.
NERI: OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or you wanna move?
DRIVER: ( obviously a hood ) You better check with your precinct.
NERI: Move it! The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately, and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street. Then he crooks a finger at the DRIVER.
NERI: Let me see you license and EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up. It parks. A young, pretty GIRL gets out. Quickly, he returns into the room.
PRIEST: Ephetha.be opened.So you may perceive the fragrance of God's EXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER ( 1955 ) The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center is arguing with NERI. Now the DRIVER looks up.
PRIEST: Do you renounce Satan.
MICHAEL: I do renounce him.
PRIEST: And all his works?
MICHAEL: I do renounce them.
PRIEST: Do you wish to be baptized?
MICHAEL: I do wish to be baptized.
PRIEST: I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi. Flash bulbs go off. Everyone is smiles, and crowds around MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE.and CARLO.
FADE OUT: EXT DAY: CHURCH ( 1955 ) The christening party outside the Church. Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others. Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave. As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up. LAMPONE gets out and works his way to MICHAEL. He whispers in his ear. This is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for. CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.
CONNIE: Kiss your Godfather. The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an excuse to back away.
MICHAEL: Carlo.we've had a change in the plans. Mama, Connie, Kay and the kids will have to take the trip out to Vegas without us.
CONNIE: Oh Mike, it's our first vacation Jesus, Connie.Sure, Mike.
CARLO: ( anxious to please ) Jesus, Connie.Sure, Mike.
MICHAEL: Go back to your house and wait for He kisses KAY.
MICHAEL: ( to KAY ) I'll just be a couple of days. People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to drive off.
HAGEN: You'd better make your call to Barzini; Michael's ready. TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.
TESSIO: We're on our way to Brooklyn. He hangs up and smiles.
TESSIO: I hope Mike can get us a good deal I'm sure he will.
HAGEN: ( gravely ) I'm sure he will.
BUTTON MAN: The boss says he'll come in a separate car. He says for you two to go on ahead.
TESSIO: ( frowning ) Hell, he can't do that. It screws up all my arrangements. THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.
HAGEN: ( gently ) I can't go with you either, Tessio. He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he panics, and then he accepts it.
TESSIO: ( after the pause ) Tell Mike it was business.I always liked him.
HAGEN: He understands that. TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.
TESSIO: ( softly ) Tom, can you get me off the hook? For old times' sake?
HAGEN: I can't. HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group. Then about twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back. TESSIO is led into a waiting car. HAGEN looks away, and walks off.
CARLO: You have to answer for Santino. The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and backs into the living room.
MICHAEL: You have to answer for Santino. The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and backs into the living room.
MICHAEL: You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people. That little farce you played out with my sister. Did Barzini kid you that would fool a I swear I'm innocent. I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent. Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
CARLO: ( dignity ) I swear I'm innocent. I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent. Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
MICHAEL: ( quietly ) Barzini is dead. So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene.I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did. CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.
MICHAEL: ( almost kindly ) Don't be frightened. Do you think I'd make my sister a widow? Do you think I'd make your children fatherless? After all, I'm Godfather to your son. No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business. I'm putting you on a plane to Vegasand I want you to stay there. I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry. Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
CARLO: ( sees his way out ) ( softly ) Good, good. Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the CARLO moves to the door; opens it. There is a car waiting; with a group of MEN around it. He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.
MICHAEL: ( softly ) Good, good. Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the CARLO moves to the door; opens it. There is a car waiting; with a group of MEN around it. He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.
MICHAEL: I'll call your wife and tell her what flight you're on.
NERI: You know I would never question anything you say.
MICHAEL: ( smiles ) Speak your mind.
NERI: I'll do this for you; you know I No. This I have to do.
MICHAEL: No. This I have to do.
MICHAEL: Sit in the car.
MICHAEL: Where's the boss?
MAN: In the back. Hey Frank, someone wants you. A MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.
MAN: What is it? He stops, frozen in fear. It is FABRIZZIO. VIEW ON MICHAEL. Gunfire from under his coat. FABRIZZIO is cut down. MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.
CONNIE: She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon MICHAEL and KAY.
KAY: ( comforting ) But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL. NERI is watchful.
CONNIE: You lousy bastard; you killed my You waited until our father died and nobody could stop you and you killed him, you killed him! You blamed him about Sonny, you always did, everybody did. But you never thought about me, never gave a damn about me. What am I going to do now, what am I going to do. TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders from him. But he stands there, waiting for his sister to Connie, how could you say such Why do you think he kept Carlo on the Mall? All the time he knew he was going to kill my husband. But he didn't dare while my father was alive. And then he stood Godfather to our child. That coldhearted And do you know how many men he had killed with Carlo? Just read the papers. That's your husband. She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria she has no saliva.

MICHAEL: Get her home and get a doctor. The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her, gently but firmly. KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from MICHAEL. He feels her look.
MICHAEL: She's hysterical. But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.
KAY: Michael, it's not true. Please tell me.
MICHAEL: Don't ask me.
KAY: Tell me!
MICHAEL: All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last Is it true? She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so directly that we know he will tell the truth.
KAY: Is it true? She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so directly that we know he will tell the truth.
MICHAEL: ( after a very long pause ) KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs him. Then she kisses him.
KAY: ( through her tears ) We both need a drink.
CLEMENZA: Don Corleone. The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her husband has become.
