RONNA: They're at the bottom. In red. Where it says, double coupons.
RONNA: Look how far it got you.
CLAIRE: ( low ) Why not?
SIMON: Why not?
CLAIRE: She's been on for fourteen hours.
SIMON: She trades her apron for her coat.
RONNA: She trades her apron for her coat.
SIMON: I haven't asked you yet.
RONNA: Answer's still no.
SIMON: Are you menstrual? Pre-menstrual, post-
RONNA: One of the three. Okay, Simon. In case you haven't heard the buzz, the scoop, the word on the street, I'm getting evicted. Tomorrow. So pardon me if I'm not in a holly-jolly mood right now.
SIMON: Ronna, they wouldn't evict you at Christmas. You'd be ho-ho-homeless.
SIMON: Is that why all the overtime? How much do you owe?
RONNA: Three eighty.
SIMON: That's nothing.
RONNA: More than I got.
SIMON: I'll give you twenty right now for a
SIMON: A beat. The start of a smile. Simon's just pushing her
SIMON: Ronna, do you want my shift?
RONNA: ( CONTINUED )
SIMON: I haven't punched in yet.
SIMON [CONT'D]: Look, my best mates are going to Las Vegas this weekend. I've never been I'm told it's incredible. If you took my shift, I could go with them. Everybody wins. Cash up front.
RONNA: Beyond exhausted, she starts walking back to the store. After a beat.
SIMON: Ronna? Are you certain I couldn't have a
AN ARM: reaches out through the case, grabbing it away. The woman
CLAIRE: One of us has to go.
MANNIE: Dead celebrities?
RONNA: Loser goes up. Steve McQueen.
CLAIRE: Mannie is checking out a small printed rave invite. In a flash of inspiration.
CLAIRE: Michael Landon.
MANNIE: Lucille Ball.
RONNA: Burt Lancaster. Can you drive?

MANNIE: Don't say Molly Ringwald.
CLAIRE: Martha Raye.
MANNIE: Nice. Robert Mitchum.
RONNA: Shit! M. M. MMMMMMMMalcolm X.
CLAIRE: You can't say Malcolm X.
RONNA: He's famous, he's dead.
MANNIE: That's like a rule or something. Nothing starts with X.
RONNA: That's not my problem.
MANNIE: ( to Claire ) You can challenge.
CLAIRE: Okay, I challenge. Give me one dead celebrity that starts with X.
RONNA: This is bullshit. I am not working the fucking register.
RONNA: X.X.There is one. I know I thought of one before. Break was over four minutes ago. Who's up I am.
SWITTERMAN: Break was over four minutes ago. Who's up I am.
RONNA: I am.
MANNIE: Xerxes. Some dead pharaoh guy. Starts with X.
RONNA: Xerxes. Some dead pharaoh guy. Starts with X.
MANNIE: Xerxes. Some dead pharaoh guy. Starts with X.
RONNA: That wasn't it. I never heard of fucking Pharaoh coulda saved your ass.
MANNIE: Pharaoh coulda saved your ass.
ADAM: Xerxes. I took music appreciation twice.
ON RONNA: Adam's friend ZACK is with him in line, YABBERING on a cellular phone. Ronna hits total. $25.12. Adam hands her a credit card. She swipes it through the machine and starts bagging their groceries.
ADAM: Does a British guy still work here?
RONNA: He went to Vegas for the weekend.
ADAM: Betcha wonder why we're buying all this orange juice.
RONNA: She's not going to rise to the bait. Zack looks over at Adam, then to Ronna.
ZACK: ( checks nametag ) Ronna. You don't know where we could get something to go with this orange juice, do Doughnuts, aisle four.
RONNA: Doughnuts, aisle four.
ZACK: But then you get the weird taste in your mouth. I was thinking something a little more euphoric. The British guy usually hooks us up.
RONNA: How much?
ZACK: Twenty at twenty.
RONNA: You're overpaying.
ZACK: We're desperate. A bunch of us are going to this party tonight, this warehouse Mary Xmas Supafest.
RONNA: Mary Xmas Supafest.
ADAM: You're going?
ZACK: And we had planned this kinda pre-party. Only there's 20 of us, it's like all or
ZACK: ( low ) A friend was supposed to get the stuff in Chicago, but now he's snowed in. So if you could help us out here.
RONNA: Gimme a number. Let me see what I can do.
ZACK: Kick ass.
RONNA: So do you want the o.j. or not?
ADAM: 11 INT. MANNIE'S CAR / PARKING LOT - NIGHT 11
CLAIRE: You know that Simon's in Vegas.
RONNA: I don't need Simon. I'm going to Todd.
MANNIE: Todd GAINES?
CLAIRE: Who's Todd Gaines?
MANNIE: Simon's dealer.
CLAIRE: You can't do that, can you? I mean, go around Simon.
RONNA: Ok, listen up. If Simon were here which he's not he would charge fifteen, when I know he gets it for ten.
MANNIE: But it's like an evolutionary leap. You're moving up the drug food chain. Without permission.
CLAIRE: Ronna, you shouldn't do this.
RONNA: Both of you chill the fuck out. It's just once. When Simon gets back, we can still overpay for quarters if it makes you feel all warm and happy. But this is my deal, so just sit back and watch. Besides, Todd likes me. This won't be any
INTERCOM VOICE: Todd! It's Ronna Martin. You know me through Simon.
RONNA: Todd! It's Ronna Martin. You know me through Simon.
INTERCOM VOICE: Can I come up?
RONNA: Can I come up?
RONNA: Shades drawn, the room is completely insulated from reality. The light bulbs have been markered over, casting eerie pools of red and green light. Broken CD's dangle off a tiny Christmas tree by the stereo. Slacker seasonalism.
RONNA: I didn't wake you up, did I?
GAINES: He settles into an overstuffed couch and lights a Marlboro. Adjusts himself in the crotch. Motions for her to take a chair. She's more nervous than she wants to let on.
GAINES: I thought you were still buying quarters off Simon. Least what Simon pretends are I keep him honest.
RONNA: I keep him honest.
GAINES: At that level you're supposed to pinch. It's the economics of it.
GAINES: You leaving?
GAINES: Be good.
GAINES: I take it this is not a social call.
RONNA: I need a favor.
GAINES: A favor? Wow. I didn't know we were such good friends, Ronna. Because if we were, you would know I give head before I give favors. I don't even give my best friends head, so the chance of your getting a favor right now are pretty fucking slim. You might try just telling me what you want to buy.
RONNA: Twenty hits of ecstacy.
CLOSE UP: The volume meter, climbing fast. Out of the green, into the red. The MUSIC is deafening.
ON GAINES: On top of Ronna, face in her ear. His hand wraps around her head, holding her tight. We can't HEAR what he's saying. Ronna's eyes betray her fear.
GAINES: You come here out of the blue asking for twenty hits. Just so happens twenty is the magic number where intent to sell becomes trafficking.
RONNA: Todd, I would never fuck you like that.
GAINES: How would you fuck me? Would you strap it
GAINES: What's the occasion?
RONNA: There's this big Christmas party thing. Warehouse, you know. A bunch of us are doing sort of a pre-party thing.
GAINES: Friends of yours. You're not going to go and try to sell this on me, are you?
RONNA: You're not dealing.
GAINES: You're not dealing.
RONNA: Swear to God.
GAINES: This is the real thing. Pharmaceutical grade, not that crunchy herbal rave shit. Don't let anyone double dose or you'll be frying eggs off `em in the emergency room. One hit per headbanger.
RONNA: He snaps the cap on tight.
GAINES: Twenty at fifteen is 300.
RONNA: Fifteen? I was thinking more like ten.
GAINES: You already did strap it on.
RONNA: It's just that I know you charge Simon Inflation's a bitch.
GAINES: Inflation's a bitch.
RONNA: Here's the deal. There's 20 of us. I need all of this. But I only have two hundred. I mean, that's all I have.
GAINES: See, that would be doing you a favor, and you know how I feel about favors.
RONNA: I could leave something with you.
GAINES: I already got a fucking Swatch. I need something I know you'll come back for.
RONNA: Claire, could you come up with me for a
RONNA: Forty-five minutes. Hour, tops. You just have to sit there.
CLAIRE: Hello! He's a drug dealer.
RONNA: Jesus, Claire. Don't get 818 on me here. How much shit have I done for you? This is nothing.
CLAIRE: No. No! You're making me an accessory.
RONNA: Claire. That bracelet of mine you're wearing is an accessory. You are just some chick who's sitting in an apartment. That's it.
RONNA: Okay, no bullshit. I need this. I don't get this money, I get evicted. My ass is out the street.
CLAIRE: You could.
RONNA: ( stopping her ) No, Claire. I don't have anyone else to go to. I am coming to you and I am asking for your help. Please. Help me.
CLAIRE: Forty-five minutes. That's like eight We'll be back by eight, I promise.
RONNA: We'll be back by eight, I promise.
MANNIE: Six-forty-four. Jesus, next time ask for
MANNIE: She looks back in. Mannie shakes the Tylenol bottle she forgot. Tosses them to her.
MANNIE: You're a pro.
RONNA: I'm a top-seeded amateur.
MANNIE: And I'm a very happy man.
BURKE: Damn good to meet you, Rhonda.
RONNA: Ronna. When I heard Philly got snowed in, I thought we were fucked for sure. Glad we found you.
BURKE: Ronna. When I heard Philly got snowed in, I thought we were fucked for sure. Glad we found you.
BURKE: Work work work. Friday must be a busy That was just a friend.
RONNA: That was just a friend.
RONNA: Some of that orange juice would be great.
ZACK: So this party tonight sounds like it's gonna be huge.
ADAM: That would be a synonym for huge.
ZACK: That would be a synonym for huge.
ADAM: Just backing you up.
ZACK: And I appreciate that.
BURKE: ( back thru door )
ADAM: ( to Burke ) Oh yeah. Hey. We bought a whole bunch of orange juice. It's in the car.
BURKE: Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is that right?
RONNA: ( suddenly ) You got a bathroom?
ADAM: Down the hall on the right.
ZACK: Let me show you.
BURKE: Maybe we could do this first.
ADAM: We said Chicago, you said Philadelphia.
A MONITOR: In black-and-white VIDEO, we're looking down on wide-angle view of the entire room a surveillance camera. We can see the reflection of someone watching.
ADAM [FILTERED]: Maybe she didn't notice.
RONNA: You're fine. You're fine.
BURKE: Everything all right in there?
RONNA: She struggles with the cap. Child safety.
RONNA: standing with her beer, cool as an Eskimo.
RONNA: All yours.
BURKE: Ronna, hun, do we got a deal here or not?
RONNA: ( turns, backing away ) No. No, see we don't. That's what I came here to tell you. I couldn't get
BURKE: C'mon, resourceful girl like you? I don't believe it.
RONNA: It's true.
BURKE: I just want to make a deal here, Ronna. Can we make a deal?
RONNA: Who the fuck are you? Monty Hall?
RONNA: Did you know I'm only 17?
LOOP: Man, I don't know what happened, it's like the machine just ate the tape.
RONNA: I think it was Simon they were after. He deals all the time out of the store. I mean, he makes change out of the fucking They didn't know who was dealing, just that it was someone at the store?
MANNIE: They didn't know who was dealing, just that it was someone at the store?
RONNA: They were fishing. I bit. It's Claire. She paged me while I was in We go back to Todd. Tell him they didn't show up, whatever. And then just swap the pills for Claire.
RONNA: It's Claire. She paged me while I was in We go back to Todd. Tell him they didn't show up, whatever. And then just swap the pills for Claire.
MANNIE: We go back to Todd. Tell him they didn't show up, whatever. And then just swap the pills for Claire.
RONNA: We can't.
MANNIE: Why not?
RONNA: They're gone. I flushed them.
MANNIE: Oh shit.
RONNA: Think of something. I need a hundred bucks or 20 hits of X.
RONNA: She turns his chin to hold his eyes to the light. They're wild and dilated. And his smile resurfaces despite his best He sits quietly, a scolded dog.
RONNA: You took one, didn't you? Fuck you, Mannie! How could you do this to me? I need you now.
RONNA: Just drive. I have an idea.
MANNIE: Just drive. I have an idea.
RONNA: Just drive. I have an idea.
SWITTERMAN: comes ROARING by behind her, heading for the front. She tries to duck away, but he's too steamed to even notice her. Ronna does a quick check to see if she got everything. Hurrying down the aisle, she swipes a bottle of Evian.
TM: The two stockboys give a wide-eyed, Spielberg stare. We MOVE to the next aisle, where the Coupon Woman is staring at the same thing. We MOVE again to Ronna at the end of her aisle. She just now sees it.
RONNA: Were they round or oval?
MANNIE: ( recovering ) Round. White. Like aspirin. Like baby
RONNA: ( holding them up ) A or B?
MANNIE: ( CONTINUED )
RONNA: You're sure?
MANNIE: I wasn't really looking.
RONNA: Stop fucking paging me, Claire!
GAINES: ( on phone ) Speak!.Just licking my dick, whazzup with you?.Yeah.The Crazy Horse, you'll have to look it up.I don't know what I'm up to. ( to Claire ) Where's this party at?

GAINES: That's no problem. These things happen, I understand that. Let me just fill out a return slip here, and I'll have the manager give you a Todd, I'm trying to explain what happened. They had already gotten stuff from somewhere else. It was just a case of miscommunication, I thought.
RONNA: Todd, I'm trying to explain what happened. They had already gotten stuff from somewhere else. It was just a case of miscommunication, I thought.
HUXLEY [SUBTITLES]: Xiang Kai-Shek. Famous Chinese ruler guy. Starts with X.
MANNIE [SUBTITLES]: No. "C" Chiang Kai-Shek.
HUXLEY [SUBTITLES]: You're going to die.

RONNA: That's fine. Todd, I'm really sorry about all this.
GAINES: Hey Ronna.
GAINES: I just gave you a favor.
RONNA: ( a smile ) And here I thought you just gave me head.
RONNA: Pin me.
CLAIRE: Okay, at the risk of sounding like. You know. Me. What are you going to do about getting evicted? You're still short, aren't you?
CLAIRE: What? What?
RONNA: Hi. I'm Kelly, and this is Donna. We were wondering if you might want to hang
FILA GUY: I think I feel something.
RONNA: It's really smooth, isn't it? Donna's brother is a pharmacist. He got it for

RONNA: Four hundred.
RONNA: who had her own groove going. She shoves him back into the wheel, a foot on his ass. Claire, behind her, YELLS something in her ear. We can't hear a thing. Ronna downs the rest of her drink, hands Claire the cup. That's not what Claire meant she's a little pissed but Ronna is oblivious. Both hands free, Ronna pushes her way deeper into the eye of the storm. She adjusts her holly crown. She's sky high and loving every minute of it.
FILA GUY: This girl inside. She and her friend have Ecstasy? The real shit?
SPIDER MARINE: Ecstasy? The real shit?
FILA GUY: Pharmaceutical grade. None of the crunchy herbal rave shit.
ANOREXIA GIRL: Best twenty bucks you could spend.
BOUNCER: ( re: sign on door )
HEY!!: ( re: sign on door )
NO EXIT!!: The Bouncer is blindsided by Gaines, who charges after Ronna.
GAINES: races past. Ronna kneels down to Mannie, who's hunched over his knees sweating and shaking.
RONNA: What's wrong? Mannie?
RONNA: Jesus. You're burning up.
MANNIE: I can't feel my hands.
RONNA: Listen to me. We're going to find Claire and get out of here.
RONNA: Sweetheart. Mannie. I'm going to leave you here. I'm going to get the car and come back for you.

RONNA: Todd, I can explain.

GAINES [CONT'D]: The thing is, it's not like I'm in a highly ethical industry. But goddamn, Ronna. You fucked me over for 20 lousy
RONNA: It's not what it looks like. I mean, it sort of is, but it's complicated.
GAINES: Not really.
RONNA: I know I fucked up, but I can make it up to you. Please, Todd.
GAINES: I'm the last fucking person you should be expecting a favor from.
RONNA: I have the cash. I have more than I owe So now you're an entrepreneur.
GAINES: So now you're an entrepreneur.
GAINES: stands where he is, gun still in hand, dumbfounded. He looks to the Miata. It suddenly takes off, kicking up dirt and grass. For a moment, all is quiet. Finally, Gaines tucks the gun into his jeans. One last look around, then he starts working his way back across the parking lot. Disappears.
RONNA: There's no answer. The YELLING hurts. She won't do that A sudden spasm of pain. She winces, sobbing. It passes.
RONNA: Mannie, I got it! I remembered who the fuck it was! Perry Farrell's dead girlfriend. Xiola Blue. X-I-O-L-A. Fuck, I knew there was one.
RONNA: Don't you get it? I win.
CLAIRE: Fuck. Simon hangs up the phone without saying goodbye. He continues down the list.
CLAIRE: Simon, no one is going to take your shift.
SIMON: Ronna, do you want my shift?
RONNA: Are you serious?
SIMON: I haven't punched in yet.
SIMON [CONT'D]: Look, my best mates are going to Las Vegas this weekend. I've never been, I'm told it's incredible. If you took my shift, I could go with them. Everybody wins.
SIMON: Shit. Shit!
SIMON: Fucking let me out of here!
THREE MEN: back off, laughing. We are.
TINY: Mo'fuckin Jack-in-the-box.
MARCUS: Dude, you passed out before we left L.A.
TINY: Pop! Goes the asshole.
TINY: So this chick, she's bobbing up and down on my dick like she's fucking Marilyn She actually found your dick?
SINGH: She actually found your dick?
TINY: ( ignoring ) Then she starts going around the ouside you know, painting the treewhen WHACK! It hits her in the eye. And her contact, it's like stuck on my dick.
TINY: Her contact lens. It's stuck on the end of my dick.
MARCUS: Was it hard or soft?
TINY: What, my dick?
SINGH: The contact lens.
MARCUS: Do you remember if it was a colored lens? That she used to have two blue eyes and now she had one blue and one brown?
TINY: What the fuck does that matter?
MARCUS: ( leaning over seat ) It matters because it happened to me. It was my story. I told this story about a year ago. The difference was, I knew those small-but-important details. That, and it was true.
TINY: Oh. Whatever.
MARCUS: A beat. And another. The matter just won't drop.
TINY: A beat. And another. The matter just won't drop.
TINY: Yo, pull your stinky dinky out of my ass. I was just trying to make conversation. Fuck. Give a nigger a break.
MARCUS: What nigger? This nigger?
TINY: My mother's mother's mother was black.
MARCUS: So you say, yet we have never seen a picture of this Ebonic woman.
SINGH: Stop. Truce.
MARCUS: If you were any less black, you would be Look at your skin.
SIMON: ( moaning ) Look at your skin.
MARCUS: Look at your skin.
TINY: I see black because I know I am. Color is a state of mind.
MARCUS: Thank you Rhythm Nation.
SIMON: So what does Valentina do?
MARCUS: She's a nutritionist. She also teaches a class at this college.
SIMON: What class?
MARCUS: Tantric sexuality for couples.
SINGH: She teaches people how to fuck?
TINY: Man, I taught myself.
MARCUS: ( to Simon ) You shouldn't eat shrimp. It's loaded with iodine.
TINY: This shit is expensive. You're paying five bucks for lettuce and seeds and shit.
MARCUS: Thing is, most people really don't know how to make love. They just put it in and move it around until they get off. What tantra teaches you is how to prolong and deepen the experience, bring it to a higher level. If one man in ten were having the sex I'm having, there would be no war.
SIMON: What's the longest you and her ever did Fourteen hours.
MARCUS: Fourteen hours.
SINGH: Holy shit!
TINY: How many times you shoot?
MARCUS: Not once.
SIMON: Fourteen hours, you didn't go once. Not even at the end?
MARCUS: You redirect the orgasm inside. How long does your orgasm last? A couple seconds? I've had orgasms that lasted an hour and a half.
SIMON: Swear to God. And I do mean Allah.
MARCUS: Swear to God. And I do mean Allah.
SINGH: When was the last time you got off? I mean like, wet.
MARCUS: I haven't ejaculated in six months.
TINY: Six months!
MARCUS: Anyone can do it. All it takes is You are some kind of Obi Wan Kenobi
TINY: You are some kind of Obi Wan Kenobi

MARCUS: He's the good drug dealer. I get We'll pay cash anyway. This is just to get the room.
SIMON: We'll pay cash anyway. This is just to get the room.
SIMON: Could you answer a question. .Rachel? Hypothetically, do you think a man could make love to a woman for 14 hours without ever achieving climax?
DESK WOMAN: I think my manager would be better able to answer that question. Would you like me to call him over?
SIMON: No. Not necessary.
DESK WOMAN: Great then. Welcome to the Riviera.
SIMON: ( low )
MARCUS: Did I tell you not to eat the shrimp?
SINGH: I have something for you. Where did I put it? Oh, it's right here.

SIMON: Let me borrow some money.
MARCUS: Where's your money?
SIMON: I lost it We've been here five minutes.
MARCUS: We've been here five minutes.
SIMON: I was playing this game at a hundred dollar table and I didn't understand it, but now I do. I think I figured out how to beat it.
MARCUS: Let me see your wallet.
MARCUS: You can have it back in an hour. No, no. No buts. One hour, right here.
BECKY: Okay, if you're from over there, then where did you meet these friends? Of yours. Who I don't see.
SIMON: They already knew each utter, but Marcus I met in traffic school.
REBECCA: ( mocking ) Een traffic skewl?
SIMON: I'm a good driver, I am. I learned everything from American television. Hunter, Magnum P.I. The Knight Rider is an excellent program. Do you want to be getting high with us?
REBECCA: Do you want to be getting high with us?
BECKY: ( explaining ) Otherwise, I can't hold it in.
BECKY: Oh my God! You're fine. You're fine.
REBECCA: You're fine. You're fine.
REBECCA: ( to Simon ) Tell her she's fine.
SIMON: You're beautiful.
BECKY: Did you go?
BECKY: Why not?
SIMON: Tantra, baby.
LATER: A new position, Rebecca on top and sweating. Next to Simon, Becky is passed out and SNORING. It's only as we look over Rebecca's back that we see
MARCUS: I am not a bathroom attendant!
SIMON: Hey. We're leaving.
MARCUS: Fuck yeah.
FERRARI MAN: Keep it close and there's an extra ten bucks for you.
MARCUS: Get in. Get in the car. Get in.
SIMON: ( shouting over noise ) Question. When you're doing tantra, you hold it in at the end, right?
MARCUS: No. Never. Redirect the energy, but you never hold it in. Haven't you ever gotten blue balls? Hurts like a bitch.
SIMON: ( nodding ) Sort of a dull ache.
MARCUS: Marcus looks over to Simon, who is trying to get his breath.
MARCUS: See if there's a map.
SIMON: Orange County.
SIMON: Holy shit.
MARCUS: Don't point it at me!
SIMON: How do I know if it's loaded?
MARCUS: First, you stop pointing it at me.
MARCUS: Floor. Floor!
SIMON: I've never held a real gun before. It's heavier than I thought.
MARCUS: Great, put it back.
SIMON: I want to know if it's loaded. How do
MARCUS: Hold the wheel. I hold ten men's lives in my hand.
SIMON: I hold ten men's lives in my hand.
MARCUS: It's a nine millimeter. It doesn't have stopping power.
SIMON: Right. For that you'd need Magnum Force.
SIMON: This is why I came here. This is America. I'm serious. You want to take one symbol for all of America, it's not the flag or the hawk.
MARCUS: .or the automobile. America is about a man and a gun.
SIMON: .or the automobile. America is about a man and a gun.
MARCUS: The N-R-A.
SIMON: You're certain?
MARCUS: The E.R.A. was this chick thing in the Chicks with guns?

TINY: I'm kicking your ass if you knock again.
BOY: Fuck you.
MARCUS: Listen up. They're going to ask if you want buy a bottle of champagne. You don't, but don't say that right off.
SIMON: Champagne means you want a private dance. You can't afford it, neither can I. But if they know we're not biting, they don't even dangle the bait.
MARCUS: Champagne means you want a private dance. You can't afford it, neither can I. But if they know we're not biting, they don't even dangle the bait.
SIMON: So, "champagne" is a code. What does vodka mean?
MARCUS: At the door, Marcus stops Simon before he goes in.
MARCUS: We have one word, champagne. You can order anything you want, anything, as long as it's not champagne.
SIMON: I'd like to buy your most expensive bottle of champagne.
MARCUS: VIC JR.
SIMON: VIC JR.
NOELLE: ( yelling ) Hands! Hands! The other one!
NOELLE: The other one!
MARCUS: Yo. Yo! He fucked up, he lost control.
MARCUS: We're leaving.

VICTOR: What happened!
HOLLY: They shot Vic. They went out the back.
VICTOR: ( handing off gun ) Find them.
HOLLY: Call 911.
VICTOR: No! No cops.
MARCUS: What are you doing?
SIMON: Getting rid of the weapon.
MARCUS: It has your fingerprints on it.
SIMON: Oh shit.
SIMON: Do we answer?
MARCUS: It's probably Orange County asking where the hell his car is.
SIMON: It's a cell phone. They can trace where we are even if we don't answer.
MARCUS: Get the gun. Go. Find it.
VICTOR: Just because a rapper has a white buddy doesn't mean he's Sidney Fucking Poitier. You check them. You pat them down.
VICTOR: ( to Noelle ) And you, you were on top of him. You didn't feel anything. This thing. This thing is a wall of shit. It is a fucking call from on high that I have to leave. I have to get out before this all just falls in on me. You know what wakes me up in the middle of the night, covered in sweat? You aren't any worse than anyone else of your fucked up generation. Towel. In the old days, you know how you got to the top? By being better than the guy ahead of you.
HOLLY: They said they were from Los Angeles.
VICTOR: Then they must be staying somewhere, isn't that right Noelle?
ANNOUNCER [V.O.]: Steve decided to try his hand at craps.
TINY: Yo! Mmmhmm. Room 875.
SINGH: Who was that?
TINY: Some shit, I dunno.
VICTOR: 91 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT 91
THE MAN: The other one, honey.
THE WOMAN: Sure is a fun way to spend Christmas, isn't it?
THE WOMAN: This isn't our floor.
THE MAN: Maybe we're five.
THE WOMAN: Or six. We'll try both.
MARCUS: All right, listen up. We're leaving in 30 seconds. Grab what you can.
TINY: What the fuck?
MARCUS: Just do it. Now!
TINY: ( low ) Hey. Kid.
BOY: Fuck you.
INTERCUT: Look, I'm really sorry, you know? It's just, it would be really swell if you would open this door. Now. It's kind of an emergency.
TINY: Look, I'm really sorry, you know? It's just, it would be really swell if you would open this door. Now. It's kind of an emergency.
BOY: Hundred bucks.
TINY: ( CONTINUED )
SIMON: Give him the money.
OTHER SIDE: The Boy counts the money, straightening the bills.
TINY: Fingers reach into the hole, trying to pull back the bolt. Finally catch it. The door swings open, revealing. .an empty room. Colt .45 in hand, Victor storms in. Checks behind doors and under beds. The suitcases are half-packed.
SINGH: ( whisper ) They're in.
MARCUS: ( whisper ) If you let them in here, they will kill you. Understood?
BOY: ( pointing ) Down the hall. That way.
SIMON: I got `em.
MARCUS: They're right behind us.
TINY: In answer to his question, the Ram Charger SLAMS into the trunk of the Cadillac. Simon cranks the wheel, barely avoiding the car ahead of him. Not slowing, Simon aims for the entrance lane, where the bar is coming down behind a small Nissan. Threading the needle, Simon makes it past the car and the gate. The Ram Charger smashes through the bar.
MARCUS: Cop. Cop!
SIMON: How did they find us?
MARCUS: It's their town. I'm sure they have
MARCUS: We have to get off the major streets. Take a right up here. No, not here!
SIMON: Hold on.
TINY: Mother of fuck!
SINGH: ( looking out back ) I don't see `em.
MARCUS: ( looking back ) Wait, no. They're coming in.
SINGH: ( looking back ) Wait, no. They're coming in.
MARCUS: We can't make it!
MARCUS: At the last moment, Simon SLAMS on the brakes. They're skidding towards it. Marcus grabs the wheel and jerks it. The front bumper catches the wall, sending the trunk SLAMMING against the far alley wall. A ear-piercing SCREECH. A ribbon of sparks shoots off as the front and rear bumpers are scraped away. Forward momentum finally stops.

VICTOR: 117 EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 117
SINGH: Just so we're clear. You stole a car, shot a bouncer, and had sex with two You had sex with two women?
TINY: You had sex with two women?
SIMON: We can be in Mexico by noon. I say we split up from there. I'll take Baja.
MARCUS: Fuck Mexico. We're going home. To L.A.
SINGH: Simon, think about it. If they were going to call the cops, they would have called them in Las Vegas. They just wanted us gone, and we're gone. It's over.
VICTOR: ( on phone ) Tommy, it's Vic. I need you to run a credit card for me. You ready?
VICTOR: First name `Todd.' Last name `Gaines.'
CLAIRE: ( low ) Why not?
SIMON: Why not?
CLAIRE: She's been on for fourteen hours.
ZACK: Don't forget, detective. I was cleared of all charges.
ADAM: I don't care how many high-priced lawyers you bring in. Eden Valley will never stand for your kind of scum.
BURKE: You work out, don't you?
ADAM: You have to. It's in the contract.
BURKE: No, you have a great body.
BURKE: Hey! People in here!
ZACK: Just so we're clear. Whether you get something on this guy or not, Adam and I are done today. Finished. Charges dropped. That's how it works, right?
ZACK: Seems to me, if a guy's so concerned about the legal process, how come he finds himself getting busted for possession?
BURKE: Seems to me, if a guy's so concerned about the legal process, how come he finds himself getting busted for possession?
BURKE: Relax. I sign your form and the whole thing goes away. Your lawyer got you a good deal.
ADAM: Is it safe to have a radio against my balls like this?
LOOP: Safe enough.
LOOP: I think my girlfriend watches your show.
BURKE: Tell them what your girlfriend does.
LOOP: She doesn't do anything.
BURKE: They're not even married and she does nothing. My wife we've been married two years she still takes overtime three nights a week.
BURKE [CONT'D]: My wife's a deputy sherriff, you believe that? A cop and a sherriff, married. It's like the freakin' odd couple.
ZACK: I smell a pilot. You guys got girlfriends? What am I saying? You gotta lot of girlfriends don't you? You got women sending you their panties. Two good- looking guys. What do you say?
BURKE: You guys got girlfriends? What am I saying? You gotta lot of girlfriends don't you? You got women sending you their panties. Two good- looking guys. What do you say?
LOOP: ( mouth full ) Pussy magnets.
BURKE: If I was not a happily married man I would be rubbing up against you to get some of that. Some of the pussy power.
ADAM: Actually, I'm settled down. Four years now.
LOOP: ( still chewing ) No ring.
ADAM: Nothing legal.
BURKE: ( to Zack ) How about you?
ZACK: This is a crime. You two should be out getting laid.
BURKE: This is a crime. You two should be out getting laid.
ADAM: Star light, star bright first star that I see tonight.

ZACK: About five-eight, brown hair, blue eyes.
BURKE: She faithful?
ZACK: She faithful?
BURKE: She faithful?
ZACK: No. I don't think so.
BURKE: You faithful?
ZACK: Not anymore.
BURKE: ( to Loop ) Zack's girlfriend is fucking around on Man, I'm sorry. How did you find out?
LOOP: Man, I'm sorry. How did you find out?
ZACK: It's no big.I don't really want to get into it.
LOOP: C'mon, tell us.
ADAM: Absolutely. Tell us.
ZACK: I found socks.
BURKE: What, red socks, blue socks?
ZACK: White socks. You know how the good kind of socks have band around the ankle that keeps them from stretching out? When I moved in, every one of the socks had that. Suddenly, there was one sock that didn't.
BURKE: You hear that? We got John Sherlock Holmes in the car here.
ADAM: Alright. But you've been fucking around, Only after I found out.
ZACK: Only after I found out.
ADAM: 127 INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY 127
ADAM: So, Zack. Do you know who your girlfriend's fucking?
ZACK: No, Adam. I do not. I have suspicions. Mostly former boyfriends who keep What a coincidence. I have the exact same problem with my girlfriend. In fact, I think she's been sleeping around on me, Isn't it ironic.
ADAM: What a coincidence. I have the exact same problem with my girlfriend. In fact, I think she's been sleeping around on me, Isn't it ironic.
ZACK: Isn't it ironic.
ADAM: Don't you think? Maybe I should start checking for socks,
CLAIRE: Gay men are so hot. It's tragic.
ADAM: He's not here. What are we supposed to do? He's not here.
ZACK: We're going to ask. You're going to ask.
ADAM: Why me?
ZACK: You look more wholesome. Just improv.
ADAM: Who are you calling?
ZACK: Nobody. I'm giving you an opening.
ADAM: He wasn't there. The British guy, he wasn't there.
LOOP: No, we heard. You guys did great.
BURKE: This chick. Ronna. You think she can score?
ADAM: ( CONTINUED )
ZACK: ( CONTINUED )
BURKE: Then that's all we need. It's all connected. The circle of life.
BURKE: Now they're both going. What's up with So if she gets the stuff, what, you arrest We try to bring her over. See, we arrest her and then what? One crack whore off the street. So we cut her a deal. She helps us get this guy. We cut him a deal. He helps us get the guy above him. It's just like what happened with you.

ZACK: So, sooner or later, everybody's working for The Man.
BURKE: ( CONTINUED )
LOOP: ( leaning out the back room ) She's coming up.
ZACK: What if she isn't really a dealer though? If you just pulled her into this one thing, wouldn't that be entrapment?
BURKE: If she's making this deal, she's a dealer. Doesn't matter if its her first or her
BURKE: He hands Ronna the beer.
ADAM: ( to Burke ) Oh yeah. Hey. We bought a whole bunch of orange juice. It's in the car.
BURKE: Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is that right?
RONNA: ( suddenly ) You got a bathroom?
ADAM: Down the hall on the right.
ZACK: Let me show you.
SLOW MOTION: Stepping towards Ronna, his back to Burke. He very deliberately mouths a silent.
ZACK: Ronna sees it. Her eyes go wider. Zack nods.
BURKE: ( to Adam ) Now watch what I do with his wrist. I twist it away while I put on the second cuff. That way he can't go after me. He doesn't have any leverage.
BURKE: I watch all these cop shows and they never do it right. Pisses me off.
BURKE: Hey, feel the abs on this one.
BURKE: You could scrub laundry on these.
LOOP: ( re: box ) Full hands.
BURKE: A beat. Loop can't remember what it was.
LOOP: Nothing. I'm out of it. Merry Christmas, guys. Good to meet you.
ZACK: We're done, now, right? That's what we talked about. Whether or not the deal went through, we just had to do our part.
BURKE: You did your part.
ZACK: ( relieved ) Great. Well, hey. A pleasure.
BURKE: Now that he's gone, there's something I wanted to ask you guys about. Sort of a See, my wife and I Irene, she's my wife we're both working on Christmas so we're gonna have Christmas dinner tonight. And I was thinking, maybe you guys would want to come over, eat some dinner with us. My wife is great, you'll love her, then I'll sign your form. How does that sound?
ZACK: Actually, you know, I had plans.
ADAM: You did?
ZACK: I do.
ADAM: With your girlfriend?
ZACK: Yes, Adam, in fact. With my girlfriend.
ADAM: ( beat; another; then suddenly ) Wow, I can't believe I forgot this. I saw your girlfriend this morning, and she asked me to tell you that she couldn't make your plans tonight.
ADAM: ( to Burke ) It looks like we're both free.
IRENE: Yes? Hi?
ADAM: Sorry. Phone. Messages. Check?
IRENE: She points. He sheepishly crosses to get it. While he's dialing, Irene starts in with the electric mixer. Butter. Milk. Salt. Adam doesn't know where to look while he's listening to his messages. He suddenly smiles. Irene notices and stops mixing.
ADAM: ( re: phone ) They're singing Christmas carols. My family. Minnesota, they do that.
ZACK: No, stay for a sec.
BURKE: No, stay for a sec.
BURKE: Smell this. What does it smell like?
BURKE: CK One. But it's not.
ZACK: I get this for a quarter what that stuff It's nice.
BURKE: I get this for a quarter what that stuff It's nice.
ZACK: It's nice.
BURKE: He sprays some on Zack's hands, who didn't want it. While Burke turns to get some underwear, Zack tries to rub it off on the bedspread.
BURKE: ( re: bedspread ) It's down. So is the liner.
ZACK: It is soft.
BURKE: Get on.
ZACK: That's okay.
BURKE: Did you hear that?
ZACK: Hear what?
BURKE: Exactly. Individually wrapped springs. Top quality.
BURKE: I could be doing aerobics over here and you wouldn't feel it.
ZACK: I sure wouldn't.
BURKE: So, Zack. Would you say you're open to new things?
IRENE: Of course you like your job. You get to kiss all those pretty girls.
ADAM: ( mock bashful ) It does have perks.
IRENE: Tell me something. When you kiss those girls, you're not really kissing them, are you?
ADAM: It's a stage kiss. Your lips touch, but there's no tongue.
IRENE: There's no feeling. Nobody gets jealous.
ADAM: It's acting. It's not real.
ADAM: See, now, that. There was a tongue there.
IRENE: What goes with turkey?
BURKE: More wine?
ZACK: No. He doesn't want any more. Unless he does, do you?
ADAM: This has been great, just wonderful, but we're going to need to leave. Soon. Adam's not feeling well.
ZACK: This has been great, just wonderful, but we're going to need to leave. Soon. Adam's not feeling well.
ADAM: I'm not. It's true.
BURKE: If you gotta go, then I understand. But Irene and I sort of had an ulterior motive inviting you here.
IRENE: He makes it sound sinister. It's not.
BURKE: She's right. Okay, you've looked around our place. Where do you think we got most of this stuff?
IRENE: Just guess.
ADAM: ( CONTINUED )
ZACK: J.C. Penney's?
BURKE: It's actually from Confederated Products. Almost everything in this house is from Confederated Products, from the toilet paper to the mattress to those candles.
IRENE: The wine.
BURKE: Even that cologne you liked. See, Confederated Products is a multi- level direct wholesaling company. That means we don't just sell the products ourselves, we also recruit and manage teams who work under us. Irene and I started eight months ago and we're already bringing in fifty thousand a year in revenues.
IRENE: We're the number four distributor in Southern California. By March, we might be number three. Now, as law enforcement officers, Irene and I can't recruit distributors from inside the force. It's against the rules and we'd get fired. So what we do is look for people in other industries.
BURKE: Now, as law enforcement officers, Irene and I can't recruit distributors from inside the force. It's against the rules and we'd get fired. So what we do is look for people in other industries.
IRENE: .like the entertainment industry.
ZACK: ( realizing ) You want us to sell Amway.
BURKE: Confederated Products. It's a different company, different quality of product.
ZACK: I need to do something terrifically unwholesome. I need to bathe in sin.
ADAM: With me, or one of your other boyfriends?
ZACK: I have cheated on you with exactly one No. See, if I tell you, you will freak out and it will be drama. Bad not-funny Roseanne kind of drama and I am just not up for it.
ADAM: No. See, if I tell you, you will freak out and it will be drama. Bad not-funny Roseanne kind of drama and I am just not up for it.
ZACK: No. See, if I tell you, you will freak out and it will be drama. Bad not-funny Roseanne kind of drama and I am just not up for it.
ADAM: No. See, if I tell you, you will freak out and it will be drama. Bad not-funny Roseanne kind of drama and I am just not up for it.
ZACK: I'll tell you mine.
ADAM: Why not?
ZACK: Why not?
ADAM: You can't wait to tell me, can you? You're gloating. You think yours is better than mine.
ZACK: I don't.
ADAM: It's Sean Connery, isn't it?
ZACK: Count of three.
ADAM: Alright. Sure. Wait.
ADAM: Jimmy. Jimmy.
ZACK: Jimmy. Jimmy.
ADAM: Is Jimmy here?
SANDRA: Oh my God. Oh. My God.
SANDRA: ( to phone ) I'll call you back. ( to them ) Jimmy's not here. He went to this thing. Let me find it. You do know, don't you?
SANDRA: You do know, don't you?
ZACK: We know.
SANDRA: I take no responsibilty. I was only an innocent bystander. But there was once where you missed each other by three minutes. It was so exciting.
SANDRA: It's some sort of rave thing.
ZACK: ( takes card ) Mary Xmas Supafest.
SANDRA: He left an hour ago. You're not going to kill him, are you? The little shit owes me rent.
SANDRA: You're not going to kill him, are you? The little shit owes me rent.
ZACK: Okay, I just have to say this. The thing is, about Jimmy, he wasn't even that good.
ADAM: I know.
ZACK: Mediocre at best. And the sounds he made, God. It was like having sex with Nell.
ZACK: Somewhere off Greenland, hunchback whales were beaching themselves.
ADAM: And the ear thing. Hello, I have Q-Tips. That's really not necessary.
ZACK: The only thing I will give him credit for is the oral.
ADAM: What do you mean? He was terrible. At some point I just had to stop him and correct years of bad technique. I had to take him by the ears and retrain him from the throat up.
ZACK: When was that?
ADAM: October, maybe?
ZACK: Early October. And he suddenly got so much better.
ADAM: That is so disturbing. It's like you were
ZACK: Right. This right. This right! That was the right you wanted.
ZACK: What the fuck!
ZACK: Oh my God.
ADAM: It's.It's that girl.
ZACK: Her body continues its slide across the windshield, finally resting on the hood. In a sort of spasm, Adam REVS back, shaking the body off. It drops beyond the headlights. Zack looks past Adam to see Gaines standing there, gun drawn.
ZACK: Go. Go. Go!
ADAM: What if she's.
ZACK: Adam pops the clutch and they lurch backward, out of there.
ZACK: Let's think about it logically. Either she's alive, or she's dead. If she's dead, then there's nothing we can do. If she's alive, then the guy with the gun, who seemed to want to shoot her, probably did shoot her.
ADAM: So even if she's alive, she's dead.
ZACK: Adam takes another drink.
ZACK: On the plus side, the only witnesses are you, me and him. And none of us are going to want to be talking about it. So if you really think about it, it didn't turn out as badly as it could have.
ADAM: A girl is dead.
ZACK: ( snaps ) I didn't say it went perfectly.
ZACK: Holy sh.
ZACK: They wouldn't have been listening all this time.
ADAM: Hello, they could have been recording it. Everything we said could be on tape somewhere. They would know we did it.
ZACK: ( an idea ) What if we were just running lines? For a There's a pretty good chance no one's found her yet.
ZACK: There's a pretty good chance no one's found her yet.
ADAM: They will.
ZACK: No. Listen. If there's no body, there's no crime.
ZACK: Stop. Okay, stop!
ADAM: It's a Miata.
ZACK: It's a Miata.
ZACK: We'll put her in the passenger seat.
ADAM: Where will I.Or you.
ZACK: In the passenger seat. Holding her up.
ZACK: Little help?
ADAM: ( not moving ) I can't.
ZACK: What do you mean?
ADAM: I can't do this.
ZACK: Okay, listen to me.
ADAM: She's dead.
ZACK: She's not dead.
ADAM: She's dead. I hit her and I killed her.
ZACK: No you didn't, okay? This is all just make-believe. This is a scene. She's just acting dead. And you're just acting
ZACK: See, there's the lights, and there's the camera. Watch your blocking. There's Michelle in wardrobe, say "Hi, Hi, Michelle.
ADAM: Hi, Michelle.
ZACK: The craft service truck is right around the corner, and they have lots of little veggie burgers on the grill. And you can have one if you just help me finish this Can you smell them? Can you smell them on the grill?
ADAM: I'm not delusional.
ZACK: Then take her fucking arms!
ADAM: She's not dead.
ZACK: No shit!
ADAM: If she's not dead, that means we didn't kill her. We can just leave her.
ZACK: She's almost dead. We leave her and she dies, why did we bother coming back? I mean, you still killed her.
ADAM: What do you mean, I killed her?
ZACK: Christ, I didn't mean it that way. C'mon. I would never testify against you.
ZACK: We have to stick with Plan A.
ADAM: In Plan A she was dead.
ZACK: Okay. New plan.
FILA GUY: Hey, it's Kelly. Somebody beat the crap out of her.
ZACK: Look, she's fine. They're getting an ambulance. She's fine. What about that guy? The guy with the gun. He could still go after her.
ADAM: What about that guy? The guy with the gun. He could still go after her.
ZACK: Okay, listen. Girl in ditch that's our problem. Girl out of ditch that's her own problem. We're done. We did the right thing.
ZACK: Okay, approximately the right thing. In a half-assed, thrown-together fashion.
ZACK: As they walk off, we leave the Mary Xmas Supafest still BLARING in the distance.
ADAM: As they walk off, we leave the Mary Xmas Supafest still BLARING in the distance.
TODD GAINES: sitting alone at a booth by the window, disassembling a newspaper. He finds the comics.

CLAIRE: Do you know what I like about you?
GAINES: I'm asking. I don't know. It's not your face, because you're only medium cute. I think what it is, is you might be the first non-fake person I've met here.
CLAIRE: I'm asking. I don't know. It's not your face, because you're only medium cute. I think what it is, is you might be the first non-fake person I've met here.
GAINES: I'm serious.
CLAIRE: I'm serious.
GAINES: Professional curiousity. What are you Ginseng and lotsa caffeine.
CLAIRE: Ginseng and lotsa caffeine.
CLAIRE: You know what I like best about Christmas? The surprises. It's like, you get this box, and you're sure you know what's in it. You shake it, you weigh it, and you're totally convinced you have it pegged. No doubt in your mind. But then you open it up, and it's something completely different. Bing! Wow! Bang! Surprise! I mean, it's like you and me here.
CLAIRE: I'm not saying this is anything it's not. But, c'mon. This time yesterday, who'dda thunk it?
GAINES: ( stopping ) How did you get out?
GAINES: Simon's apartment is around the back the gate's always open. Now, you're going to take Sunset to Hyperion. At Hillhurst, you have to keep right you want Sunset Boulevard, not Sunset Why don't you just drive him there? Maybe you could help pull the trigger.
GAINES [CONT'D]: At Hillhurst, you have to keep right you want Sunset Boulevard, not Sunset Why don't you just drive him there? Maybe you could help pull the trigger.
CLAIRE: ( to Gaines ) Why don't you just drive him there? Maybe you could help pull the trigger.
SIMON: Todd, listen, I need hide out here. You won't believe the shit we got into in.
VICTOR: How was your drive? We flew.

CLAIRE: ( to Victor ) So, what? You're going to kill three ( beat, no answer ) What do you actually want?
VICTOR: A look between all parties.
SIMON: It's all flesh here, it should be okay.
SIMON: Right, great.
SIMON: It's all right. Really.
GAINES: Where are you going?
CLAIRE: I gotta get to work.
VICTOR: Look, now the girl's leaving.
SIMON: See you, Claire.
GAINES: Be good!
SIMON [O.S.]: I'm okay!
RONNA: Claire doesn't say anything, a pointed silence. Ronna keys in, checks the drawer. Claire returns to her register. Ronna tries to make eye contact, but no luck.
RONNA: Okay, real mature.
RONNA: Nothing. A beat. Finally.
RONNA: Alright. Mistakes were made. Things didn't go exactly as planned.
RONNA [CONT'D]: But it wasn't exactly a banner night for me, either.
CLAIRE: You are constantly using us.
RONNA: Using you? You use me. Come on, if it weren't for me, you would be sitting home every night eating popcorn and watching reruns of 90210.
CLAIRE: ( overlapping ) Mannie is your chauffeur, and I am. ( what is she? ) I am some chick you leave sitting in an ( overlapping ) That is such bullshit. Mannie does not feel that way. Ask him. Ask him! Where is he?
RONNA: ( overlapping ) That is such bullshit. Mannie does not feel that way. Ask him. Ask him! Where is he?
CLAIRE: Why would I know?
RONNA: He drove you here, didn't he?
CLAIRE: No, I got a ride. His car was still in the parking lot when I left.
RONNA: Oh shit. Shit!
RONNA: ( yelling ) Mannie? Mannie?
CLAIRE: Mannie! Mannie!
RONNA: Mannie! Can you hear me?
MANNIE: You look like shit.
RONNA: You fucked Todd Gaines?
CLAIRE: ( embarrased ) We made out.
RONNA: ( mocking ) Made out?
CLAIRE: Kissed. A little. What?
RONNA: Hello! He's a drug dealer. Found `em.
CLAIRE: Found `em.
RONNA: ( unlocking passenger door ) You might have brain damage from Dain brambage?
MANNIE: Dain brambage?
MANNIE: Xavier Kugat. Starts with X.
RONNA: You shit.
CLAIRE: I'll drive.
CLAIRE: So, do you have enough money to pay off your rent?
RONNA: And twenty left over. Maybe I'll open a savings account.
MANNIE: So what are we doing for New Year's?
RONNA: Merry Christmas, Mannie.
THE BEAST: ROARS off across the parking lot, TITLE MUSIC building.
SIMON: ( tentatively ) Who is it?
SIMON: Jesus, Todd. Thank God. You won't believe the shit I've been
JIMMY SHUBERT: Somethin' about it just didn't add up. So last night I went back to the pier to do some investigating of my own. Turns out there are two boats named the Princess. Only, one just got back from two weeks at sea Sal Dominico's boat. It got me thinkin' if Chase really did know Carmen was on to him, how come he didn't tell Lucas, or Gamble, or Myerson? Why would he drive up to Pinecliff by himself? And why would you still have his briefcase? Answer me that, Danielle. If you have an answer.
ZACK: I'm not the man you're looking for.
ADAM: We both know you were on the pier. You saw what happened to Carmen.
ZACK: Don't forget, detective. I was cleared of all charges.
ADAM: I don't care how many high-priced lawyers you bring in. Eden Valley will never stand for your kind of scum.
