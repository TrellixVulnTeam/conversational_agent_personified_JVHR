THE TOURIST: Written by Julian Fellows Based on "Anthony Zimmer" Jerome Salle
WAITER: She's waiting for someone.
YOUNGER WAITER: Probably waiting for me.
WAITER: The door's waiting for you if you don't get back to work.
MESSENGER: C'est vous, Mademoiselle?
CARA: As the messenger walks away she opens the folder and shakes out the contents. There is a ticket for the Orient Express and a handwritten letter. She spreads it out on the table like a precious treasure map. Her beautiful forehead creases with concentration as she reads.
YOUNGER WAITER: Mademoiselle! Je vous en prie
CARA'S POV: Men of various shapes and sizes are boarding "The Orient Express." She pauses only long enough to assess and discard: too old, too young, too thin, too overweight. Her gaze comes to rest on a WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN. Medium height, medium build. Standing alone. Examining his ticket. Cara glances at her reflection critically in the polished glass window of the train. Adjusts her hair and dress. Satisfied with what she sees, she turns and starts toward the WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN like a cat stalking prey. The CAMERA admiringly FOLLOWS her silky approach. The FRENCH MAN hears the click of her heels and looks up. His mouth falls open. HIS WIFE arrives and shuts it for him.
WIFE: What are you doing Vincent? Our train car is over here!
CARA: Sorry! Excuse me. Pardone moi.
FRANK: Sorry! Excuse me. Pardone moi.
ANGLE ON: A GOOD-LOOKING ENGLISHMAN loitering further down the platform, reading the Herald Tribune. Or rather, not reading it. He's been watching Cara. He lowers the paper and climbs onto the train through a different door.
CARA: I think I'm going to need your
FRANK: My zipper. It's stuck.
CARA: My zipper. It's stuck.
FRANK: I'm afraid of hurting you.
CARA: Don't be afraid. I'm. sorry.
FRANK: I'm. sorry.
CARA: It doesn't matter.
FRANK: Maybe I should let you do this
CARA: Don't give up so quickly.
FRANK: My name is Frank.
CARA: A white-jacketed STEWARD arrives.
STEWARD: ( to Frank ) Will you and your wife take dinner here or in the dining car this evening, monsieur?
FRANK: Pardon me? Oh, no. We're not The dining car would be lovely, thank you.
CARA: The dining car would be lovely, thank you.
CARA: Are you ill?
FRANK: What? No.
CARA: ( gently mocking ) So you decided to take a holiday on the Orient Express?
FRANK: I'm on my honeymoon.
CARA: Your honeymoon?
FRANK: She's in Pennsylvania.
CARA: If you'd like to tell me.
FRANK: Two weeks ago she left me. For the owner of a pizza parlor.
CARA: That's awful.
FRANK: No travel insurance. No refund on the tickets. So. here I am. On my honeymoon.
CARA: I'm sorry, Frank.
FRANK: I really loved that pizza too. "Bala Pizza" if you're ever in I wouldn't touch it. I'm loyal to
CARA: I wouldn't touch it. I'm loyal to
WAITER: A Cointreau for Mademoiselle. And for Monsieur. a "Miller Light."
FRANK: The waiter rolls his eyes and leaves them. Cara seems amused by Frank's obliviousness.
CARA: You read spy novels.
FRANK: Okay. you'd be a diplomatic attach√© or. let's see. a girl from East Germany whose father's been kidnapped by Soviet agents. They're blackmailing you into stealing. probably a microchip. There's usually a microchip What awaits me?
CARA: What awaits me?
FRANK: Trouble, certainly.
CARA: No doubt. You'll probably be shot at in less than two chapters.
FRANK: No doubt. You'll probably be shot at in less than two chapters.
CARA: Is there a man in my life? Or a candidate for the job?
FRANK: CUT TO:
JONES: We're putting a lot resources into this investigation, John. Tell me you're going to get him this time.
ACKERMAN: ( dry ) We're going to get him this time, Ms. Jones.
GOYAL: She's on the train. They'll be in Venice in the morning.
ACKERMAN: Our target's name is Alexander Pearce. British citizen, born in London into an ordinary middle class family. The only thing remarkable about his childhood was a preternatural gift for numbers.
JEAN LUC: Your mastermind couldn't pass his exams on his own?
ACKERMAN: He didn't fix his test scores; he fixed the scores for all the girls in the class. It made him very
QUINN: You've assembled quite a task force to catch a common money launderer, Mr. Ackerman.
ACKERMAN: There is nothing common about Alexander Pearce. Quiet simply, he has turned money laundering into an art form. His greatest innovation: The False Lawsuit.
QUINN: ( understanding ) The money travels from America to the Cayman Islands.
ACKERMAN: Yes, but now the money is legal.
JONES: Not quite legal. The I.R.S. has been cheated out of the revenue. We calculate that Mr. Pearce's tax bill currently stands at $743.7 million dollars.
JEAN LUC: ( whispers in French ) That explains what the American harridan is doing here.
JONES: Exactement, monsieur.
ACKERMAN: Mr. Pearce has some other debts as well. Most of you will recognize Ivan Demidov.
JONES: ( clears her throat ) The U.S. Government is not participating in an investigation of a member of the Russian parliament; our target is Alexander Pearce.
ACKERMAN: Of course.
GERMAN INTERPOL: Has Mr. Pearce ever been in
ACKERMAN: CUT TO:
ACKERMAN: Finally. Let's go.
SPECIALIST: This is gonna take a few minutes.
CARA: I'll be ready in fifteen minutes.
THE BEDROOM: Cara stands frozen beside the man's effects on the night table. The wallet. The keys. The watch.
ACKERMAN: Where is he?
ACKERMAN: You have nothing to say?
ACKERMAN: Nobody knows. He disappeared after his escape. He's had extensive plastic surgery to alter his appearance since then. Drug lord Amado Carillo did the same thing in the 90s to successfully elude authorities.
QUINN: How do you know about it?
ACKERMAN: Pearce worked with no more than a few accomplices at one time. He treated them so well that they're virtually all completely loyal. None of them would cooperate. We've questioned the ones we could find, and the only thing we learned is that Pearce apparently arranged it so even his own people have never seen him after the So nobody knows what he looks Forgive me for saying so Mr. Ackerman, but he slipped away from you when you knew his whereabouts and his appearance. What makes you think you can catch him now?
JEAN LUC: So nobody knows what he looks Forgive me for saying so Mr. Ackerman, but he slipped away from you when you knew his whereabouts and his appearance. What makes you think you can catch him now?
ACKERMAN: JEAN LUC
JEAN LUC: Forgive me for saying so Mr. Ackerman, but he slipped away from you when you knew his whereabouts and his appearance. What makes you think you can catch him now?
ACKERMAN: His girlfriend was recently released from custody. He'll come for her. We'll be waiting.
QUINN: What makes you so certain?
ACKERMAN: He'll come for her.
FRANK: I was afraid I'd missed you. I wanted to ask where you're staying in Venice. I'm supposed to catch a shuttle to my hotel but I thought I've got a better idea.
CARA: ( without turning ) I've got a better idea.
CARA: You have a booking in the name of Si, Signorina.
RECEPTIONIST: Si, Signorina.
CARA: Signora. That's my husband.
RECEPTIONIST: Very good, Senora Mason. Welcome to the Danieli. You are in the Doge's our premiere suite. Is there anything special you Have a copy of today's Herald Tribune sent up to the room My pleasure, Signora.
CARA: Have a copy of today's Herald Tribune sent up to the room My pleasure, Signora.
RECEPTIONIST: My pleasure, Signora.
PORTER: The bedroom is through here. You have two bathrooms, here and here. There is a small kitchen which.
CARA: Yes. Thank you.
PORTER: Then I will leave you.
CARA: You like it?
FRANK: What's not to like?
CARA: I'd have been bored here on my own. There's more than enough room for two.
FRANK: I can see that.
CARA: I didn't ask for an extra bed.
FRANK: No, no, no. The sofa's fine. Perfect in fact.
CARA: The luggage.
FRANK: I'll get it.
FRANK: I've put my things in the other
CARA: Have you ever been to Venice
GOYAL: She's checked into the Danieli. she's not alone.
ACKERMAN: ( to the room ) Maintain surveillance but keep your distance.
DEMIDOV: Take a seat, Mr. Quinn. Can I offer you a glass of Brunello? It's a '97.
QUINN: No thank you, Mr. Demidov.
DEMIDOV: You know I'd never admit this at home, but Vodka is for peasants. There's much we could learn from the Italians.
QUINN: I don't think so.
DEMIDOV: ( to himself ) He always had good taste.
QUINN: Mr. Demidov. if I may ask you a question. Why do you care so much about Alexander Pearce? I mean, you've come here yourself. as if it were personal.
DEMIDOV: It may be difficult for you to understand, Mr. Quinn; you Swiss are mercenary by nature. But for some of us, there are things more important than money. I put my trust in Alexander Pearce. He betrayed that trust.
CARA: So. when you're not on a Grand European Tour, what do you do in Rosemont, Pennsylvania?
FRANK: I'm a teacher. High school math. And you? What do you do?
CARA: This is what I do, Frank.
FRANK: You're good at it.
CARA: Oh look. a wedding. How lovely.
FRANK: I'm not really into weddings at this particular moment in my life.
CARA: Oh yes. I forgot.
CARA: Do you think it's really over?
FRANK: Maybe she'll change her mind. Women do. She might give you a second chance.
CARA: Maybe she'll change her mind. Women do. She might give you a second chance.
FRANK: I suppose that's a possibility. That's what I tell my statistics class anyway; life is a game of chance. Endless possibilities and permutations. You just have to calculate the odds.
CARA: You haven't answered the question.
FRANK: ( quietly ) I'd like to think that love is a question of destiny, not chance.
CARA: For a moment there you just reminded me of somebody.
FRANK: He doesn't sound like much of a He wasn't.
CARA: He wasn't.
FRANK: So why are you wearing his watch?
CARA: You're smarter than you look,
FRANK: What? No, I can't. This thing must be worth a fortune
CARA: I insist. You're doing me a Take it or I'll toss it in the
FRANK: I'll wear it until you regain your
CARA: It suits you.
FRANK: I could get used to this.
CARA: You should leave Venice tomorrow. It's a city for lovers Frank; no place to recover from a failed
FRANK: What. what did I do?
CARA: Nothing. I'm sorry.
ALEXANDER PEARCE: He stares at the name for a moment, then unzips his travel bag. Takes out his pills. Pops a bunch. Brushes his teeth. He pauses and stares at himself in the mirror as if wondering how in the world he ended up here. It's like he's staring into the face of stranger. He puts his tooth brush down and pads off to sleep on the INT. DOGE'S SUITE - MORNING The sound of the SHOWER reaches Frank in his sleep. He blinks his eyes. The morning is misty. He closes the balcony doors. Cara's bedroom door is ajar. Frank struggles not to notice. He turns to his bed and begins folding sheets. Then he hears the sound of water running in the shower. He glances over at the door ajar, the sound of the shower. it's too much. Frank walks to the bedroom door. He pushes it open. The door to Cara's bathroom is open. The outline of her naked body is visible in the shower. She lifts her wet hair and soaps the back of her neck. She sees him. Cara is so stunned she simply stands Frank walks to the shower and opens the glass door.
WAITER: Pardone Signore. Good morning. La Signora ordered this for you when she left.
FRANK: When she.?
AROUND.": The dots single out letters in a code. Frank picks up the pen and puts a faint line through the groups of unselected letters to reveal the message: "Tomorrow 11 Caffe Pesaro" Frank studies this for a moment.
THE BALCONY: Frank puts one bare foot on the stonework. He grimaces as he HEAVES himself onto the railing of the balcony adjacent to his. He hangs desperately, flailing, 100 feet over the street below. He gets a tentative hold. A PALLID FRENCH WOMAN drops her coffee and screams. The Russians sprint out to the balcony. They spot Who shoves the Pallid Woman inside, struggles past her breakfast table, and prepares to leap again but slips on the spilled coffee. Bullets shatter China around him. He cuts his foot on a broken plate. He grabs his bleeding foot.
FRANK: Goddamn it! I'm a fucking
BURLY WELSHMAN: Are ya bloody mad?
TWO SHOTS: Which explode into the Welshman's shoulder. He cries out and falls down on top of Frank. The Russians stand on the Pallid Woman's balcony and prepare to JUMP. as Frank crawls out from under the wounded Welshman and peers over the next balcony.
FRANK: INT. THE WELSHMAN'S ROOM - SECONDS LATER Frank runs through the hotel room, past the Welshman's wife to the door. A SHOT behind him and pounding feet send him out into the corridor past a room service steward to an.
ELEVATOR: Which will not do but the
A GONDOLIER: ( in Italian ) Run faster, man!
SECONDS: to decide which way to go. The alley is long and narrow on either side. An awning above. Clear sight lines. The back of the shop upends the Grand Canal.
DOMENICO: ( in Italian ) You can't let them stay over, man. You start cuddling and then she wants to borrow your car. Stop cuddling, Tomaso!
FRANK: Excuse me.
DOMENICO: ( suddenly noticing Hey, what are you doing in here?
FRANK: The officers told me to wait here. I've been sitting here for over two hours.
DOMENICO: I think they forgot about you.
FRANK: Somebody tried to kill me.
DOMENICO: Mr. Taylor, wow, you had quite a day. Eh? We got chasing, we got
FRANK: You think I'm crazy but it's all Maybe you crazy AND it's true, my
DOMENICO: Maybe you crazy AND it's true, my
FRANK: I have absolutely no idea.
DOMENICO: They followed you from the They came to the room. They pretended to be room service.
FRANK: They came to the room. They pretended to be room service.
DOMENICO: You don't scopata one of their girlfriends or something?
FRANK: I didn't "scopata" anybody!
DOMENICO: Who is.
FRANK: ( irritated ) In America the cops catch the crooks, not the victim.
DOMENICO: Ha ha, we do that sometimes here,
FRANK: How long you know Cara Mason?
DOMENICO: How long you know Cara Mason?
FRANK: I met her yesterday.
DOMENICO: And you take her to the Danieli? That must have been good meeting, I didn't take her. She took me.
FRANK: I didn't take her. She took me.
DOMENICO: You lead an exciting life, Mr. Not usually. Signora Mason was staying with "her husband" last night. You marry her, Mr. Taylor?
FRANK: Not usually. Signora Mason was staying with "her husband" last night. You marry her, Mr. Taylor?
DOMENICO: Signora Mason was staying with "her husband" last night. You marry her, Mr. Taylor?
FRANK: I think maybe Signora Mason might know why these guys behave badly. What do you think? I think that's possible.
DOMENICO: I think maybe Signora Mason might know why these guys behave badly. What do you think? I think that's possible.
FRANK: I think that's possible.
DOMENICO: You got a phone number, mobile?
FRANK: She didn't give me one.
DOMENICO: You need some clothes. I'll be right back.
FRANK: Um. thanks. Where are we going?
DOMENICO: I'm taking you to the hospital, Mr. Taylor. A doctor should take a look at you.
FRANK: I'd really rather just go
DOMENICO: Don't worry. I put you in Padua, away from Venice. You'll be safe. Any worry, you call me. I give you my home number.
NURSE: Relax signore. We're just going to make sure everything is all right inside your head.
CLERK: ( in Italian ) Unfortunately we've already re-let the room. ( nervous ) We'd rather the guests didn't know about the incident.
DOMENICO: Don't worry. I'll be discreet.
CLERK: The Clerk knocks. The door is opened by Ivan Demidov.
DEMIDOV: Of course.
DEMIDOV: ( casually ) What happened, officer?
DOMENICO: That's what I'm trying to find out, Signore.
DEMIDOV: You are a good detective.
DOMENICO: I do my best.
ACKERMAN: What did we find on the American?
JONES: He's a tourist. Member of the teacher's union. Pays his taxes. Has bad luck.
ACKERMAN: Evidently. He had a pair of Russian hit men after him. Are you still going to tell me Demidov is clean?
JONES: I never said he is clean. I just said he isn't our target.
GOYAL: I'm just wondering how they tracked them down at the hotel.
ACKERMAN: ( under his breath ) Just so long as they don't beat us to Pearce when the real one
GOYAL: The local police picked him up.
ACKERMAN: Then he's safely out of the way.
FRANK: INT. TERRACE FLAT, PADUA - EVENING INTERCUT: Domenico - in his terrace flat. He wears a T- shirt and holds a glass of wine. Loud Italian pop music plays in the background.
DOMENICO: Well it's official Mr. Taylor. You're not mad.
FRANK: That's a relief.
DOMENICO: I went to the hotel. Somebody shot at somebody. I found a shell casing. I'll have it analyzed in the morning.
FRANK: I'd like to be on a flight home tomorrow morning.
DOMENICO: Relax, you're perfectly safe where you are. You have any visits from your Signora Mason?
FRANK: ( quiet ) I wish.
DOMENICO: Never let them cuddle, Mr. Taylor. One cuddle and it all turns to merda. Good night. If you need anything, you have my number.
FRANK: ( to the Nurse ) Wrong floor.
CARA: What are you waiting for? Get in.
CARA: Did you miss me?
FRANK: A little.
CARA: ( calm ) I know.
FRANK: Do you know why?
CARA: It's because I kissed you.
FRANK: ( re: the Nurse ) That guy has nothing to do with Neither do you.
CARA: Neither do you.
FRANK: There's not enough room!
CARA: There's enough room.
FRANK: We won't make it!
CARA: I thought Americans were
CRASH!: The black car RAMS them from behind. A Russian leans out the window and fires at the outlines of Cara and Frank's HEADS. Bullets shatter the back Cara pushes Frank's head down. The sound of burning gears as the engine hits its limit. Suddenly, scraping paint, Cara's car SPRINGS forward, jetting out onto the street. The fence drops further and shudders to a halt. The black car is trapped. The Russians can only watch as Cara speeds away.
FRANK: Do I look that much like Alexander
CARA: How do you know?
FRANK: The watch.
CARA: I don't know. You're about his size. That's all.
FRANK: ( incredulous ) You don't know what your own boyfriend looks like?
CARA: Alexander crossed a very dangerous man. He changed his appearance in order to vanish.
FRANK: Don't worry. I'm taking you somewhere you'll be safe.
CARA: Don't worry. I'm taking you somewhere you'll be safe.
FRANK: We should go to the police.
CARA: Because they did such a good job protecting you before?
CARA: Frank. Frank.
FRANK: And I thought I wouldn't get to do any sight-seeing.
CARA: Here we are.
FRANK: She quickly directs the gun away from him. Frank leans over, catching his breath. Cara starts to giggle. Frank starts to laugh too.
CARA: She quickly directs the gun away from him. Frank leans over, catching his breath. Cara starts to giggle. Frank starts to laugh too.
FRANK: What are you doing?
CARA: Making sure no one sabotaged the gas lines.
MINUTES LATER: Frank pokes through the cupboards. Stocked with fine olives, tins of expensive smoked fish, viands, stewed fruit from orchards in France. He opens the icebox. Inside is frozen meat and fish. He pulls out one package of frozen orange steaks - it is labelled "BARRACUDA, CAUGHT ANTIGUA, 8/07".
FRANK: He goes Barracuda fishing?
CARA: He goes Marlin fishing. You catch the Barracudas by accident.
CARA: And she left you for a cook?
FRANK: With these ingredients, it's not
CARA: I'm glad I decided to come back for you, Frank Taylor.
FRANK: Can I ask you a question.
CARA: ( scoffs ) I'm not a criminal.
FRANK: You carry a gun, you consort with people being chased by killers. I hate to break it to you, but
CARA: Okay, I'm a criminal.
FRANK: For Alexander Pearce?
CARA: He's the most interesting man I've ever known. When I first met him, I wasn't expecting that. He took me by surprise.
FRANK: ( soft ) I don't regret it, you know.
CARA: Regret what?
FRANK: Kissing you.
CARA: What are you doing?
FRANK: I thought.
CARA: You thought what? That I saw you on the train and my heart stopped? That all my life I've been waiting for a math teacher from the Midwest to sweep me off my feet?
THE ENGLISHMAN: Have you been reading the
CARA: Yes. there was nothing there today. Is. is it you? Alexa
THE ENGLISHMAN: No names. Not on the phone.
ACKERMAN: Place him. Place him!
CARA: Do we really need another I want to make sure our guests are
THE ENGLISHMAN: I want to make sure our guests are
THE ENGLISHMAN: You're a brave and loyal girl. I'm in awe of you.
ACKERMAN: Go! Go! Go!
CARA: That's because you leave everything up to me.
THE ENGLISHMAN: ( playful ) My only concern is for those who cross you, my love.
THE ENGLISHMAN: You may not believe it, but every step of this miserable game is taken in the hope of earning your trust and ever-lasting regard. I mean that.
CARA: You have a talent for saying the right thing. You always did.
CARA: The line is dead.
GOYAL: We should check for prints. Maybe he forgot to wipe it down.
ACKERMAN: I doubt it.
SITTING AREA: Frank lies asleep on the couch. Cara walks to the kitchen and retrieves the Tuscan Cookbook. Thinking herself unobserved, she opens it. A PAGE has been turned down. A recipe for LAMB. Cara pulls out her red, felt-tipped pen. She finds a sentence in the recipe with a single pen dot beside it. Tapping her pen under letters on the page, Cara works out the code, memorizes the contents of the message and closes the book.
ON FRANK: His eyes are open.
CARA: Frank. I have to go.
FRANK: It will all be over. I'll give you the all clear and you can go back to your life. This will be a great adventure you can look back When will I see you again?
CARA: It will all be over. I'll give you the all clear and you can go back to your life. This will be a great adventure you can look back When will I see you again?
FRANK: When will I see you again?
CARA: She looks at him evenly; one last glance between two people from two completely different worlds.
FRANK: Is he worth it?
CARA: Get back inside.
FRANK: You're going to risk everything for him. Would he do the same for
CARA: It doesn't matter. I love him.
FRANK: He doesn't deserve it.
CARA: None of this is your business anymore. Now get back inside
OLD MAN: This is exactly what she did not want. But she controls her annoyance, nods in greeting and continues towards the front door.
CARA: ( to the neighbor ) Mi dispiace, Signor.
ACKERMAN: Why do women find these con men so
JONES: Don't look at me. I married my personal trainer. She's twenty-six.
ACKERMAN: How did Pearce seduce that beautiful woman? Was it his charm? His looks?
GOYAL: Looks change.
ACKERMAN: Maybe it's because if he adores himself and spends every moment gratifying his desires, so then can she.
GOYAL: She's on the move. Time to go.
ACKERMAN: By all means. Let's follow the
DEMIDOV: When I was a young man, times were very hard. When an opportunity presented itself, you took it. I was twelve years old when Gregor asked me if I was ready for a man's job. He was the top chelovek in our housing block. So I said yes. He gave me a crowbar and told me to go bash in the skull of another boy who had stolen something from him.
ACKERMAN: ( pressing a button ) You know what we know.
ACKERMAN: ( into the speaker ) Hold.wait for my signal.
ACKERMAN: What is that fool doing in the middle of my operation?
FRANK: Time for Alexander and me to meet face to face.
CARA: ( quietly ) I don't know what you're talking about. Please go, I'd like to have a quiet coffee.
ACKERMAN: ( frustrated ) Move off. Move off.
FRANK: ( to the waiter ) Caffe, per favore?
CARA: Cameriere! No caffe for signor!
FRANK: ( contradicting her ) With milk!
CARA: Do you want to be dead?
FRANK: Not particularly, but I'm tired of being afraid. I've been running around like a frightened mouse long enough and I've decided I'm
GOYAL: He's not going anywhere.
ACKERMAN: Put Lipetti in. Tell him to play it like he's dealing with a rowdy guest escort him out.
CARA: Frank, you have no idea what you're sticking your nose into.
FRANK: Probably not. But I'm doing it anyway. Alexander Pearce nearly got me killed. It was his idea, He told you to pick out some random sap on the train to take a bullet for him, didn't he?
CARA: Wonderful. Another macho idiot. Conto, per favore!
FRANK: What's the lure, Cara? Obviously not his character. Is it the money? The luxury? What's any of that worth if you're getting shot at and you could go to jail?
CARA: I'm leaving Frank.
FRANK: He's smooth, right? He probably has mistresses in every European city, too.
CARA: It's really a shame you've scared him off
FRANK: What the hell?
CARA: INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY Ackerman slaps the cabin table.
ACKERMAN: Abort! Abort, goddammit!
FRANK: You hide out poolside and send your girlfriend and a total stranger to face the murderers who are after you? Not much of a tough guy, are you?
ACKERMAN: That goddamn fool. What do we do with him?
GOYAL: What do we do with him?
ACKERMAN: Throw him in the lagoon.
FRANK: Cara says nothing. She just shoots Frank an angry glance and climbs onto A VAPORETTO ( water taxi ).
AGENT: Ok Signor. you can come with us
ACKERMAN: He looks Frank up and down.
FRANK: It's borrowed.
ACKERMAN: It's a good fit.
FRANK: Ackerman reaches into his breast pocket and takes out his INTERPOL credentials. Tosses them on the table for Frank to see.
ACKERMAN: You have a vivid imagination.
FRANK: I haven't needed it lately.
ACKERMAN: I know that.
FRANK: Since when?
ACKERMAN: Since the beginning.
FRANK: Come. I want to show you something Frank.
ACKERMAN: Come. I want to show you something Frank.
ACKERMAN: ( to Goyal ) Pull up the CID Academy graduating class for 2002.
FRANK: Take a look at the second row.
ACKERMAN: Take a look at the second row.
FRANK: He is dumbfounded.
ACKERMAN: We've been watching you this entire time.
FRANK: ( dawning ) You saw those men try to kill me and you didn't intervene?
ACKERMAN: I'm trying to apprehend a major criminal. I'm not a babysitter.
FRANK: I want to speak with somebody at the American Embassy. I'm going to tell them that you and your undercover officer knowingly and recklessly endangered the life of an American citizen! Let's see what my government has to say about that!
JONES: We're aware of the situation, Mr. Taylor. But we take a long view of these things. fortunately you are unhurt.
FRANK: Then I'll go to the press. I'll tell the entire story to the New York Times.
ACKERMAN: ( quietly ) No. I don't think you'll do that.
FRANK: Why not?
ACKERMAN: Because I don't think you want to see Cara's entire career
ACKERMAN: Women like Cara don't come along very often.
FRANK: In my case, they don't come along at all.
ACKERMAN: She's the worst combination: stunning looks and a brilliant If she's so smart, how did she get caught up with Pearce?
FRANK: If she's so smart, how did she get caught up with Pearce?
ACKERMAN: It started out as a straightforward placement.
ACKERMAN: She was no longer with us. She was with him.
FRANK: Then why are you still using her?
ACKERMAN: She's all I have, Mr. Taylor. You think she'll turn him in this I don't know.
FRANK: You think she'll turn him in this I don't know.
ACKERMAN: I don't know.
FRANK: It's not just me, is it?
INTERCUT WITH: ACKERMAN on the phone at his office.
CARA: Have you got him?
ACKERMAN: You mean the idiot who ruined our Have you got him?
CARA: Have you got him?
ACKERMAN: Cara is relieved.
CARA: It's your own fault. We never should have endangered a civilian. You should have put an agent into There was no time. Besides Pearce is too smart for that; he would have spotted the agent a mile He didn't spot me.
ACKERMAN: There was no time. Besides Pearce is too smart for that; he would have spotted the agent a mile He didn't spot me.
CARA: He didn't spot me.
ACKERMAN: Apparently he didn't have to.
CARA: What makes you think he didn't?
ACKERMAN: Okay everybody, listen up.
JONES: Pearce's own villa? Why would he risk going back there? He must know we'd be watching.
JEAN LUC: Perhaps he's nostalgic.
ACKERMAN: I doubt that. Maybe there's something of value still there. He left in a hurry after all.
JONES: Call in a search team.
ACKERMAN: We searched the place after the raid last year. If there's anything hidden there, only Pearce knows where it is.
FRANK: If you're all around his house, will he show up?
ACKERMAN: If I needed your advice Mr. Taylor, I'd ask.
