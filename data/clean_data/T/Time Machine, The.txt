DAVID DUNCAN: Draft revised thru 6-25-59
DR. HILLYER: I say, this is outright rude of the man!
FILBEY: He's undoubtedly been detained. That's This is such a confounded waste of time! If he's not coming, I've any number of more important things to do.
DR. HILLYER: Speak up what is it, woman?
BRIDEWELL: Well.are we or are we not invited to dinner? Apparently we are. How long has he been gone? I can't rightly say, sir. - Several days.I hardly catch a glimpse of him lately. He never leaves the laboratory and comes out only to nibble at his meals.but he did tell me days ago about dinner tonight and left these instructions.
FILBY: Thank you, Mrs. Watchett. What does it say, Filby? What's Nothing really. - George merely says that if he is not here by eight we're to begin without him.
FILBY: Nothing really. - George merely says that if he is not here by eight we're to begin without him.
MRS. WATCHETT: Dinner is served, gentlemen! First sensible thing I've heard all
FILBY: This is peculiar. He is usually very prompt, precise and punctual.
DR. HILLYER: He's making fools of us by inviting us here and then not showing up. It's not the behavior of a gentleman.
KEMP: To say nothing of the waste of To say nothing of the waste of One thing I will say for George, he keeps the best cellar in the south of England.and Mrs. Watchett is the finest cook in the world. - I think I'll drink to that!
FILBY: Good lord! - What's happened?
TIME TRAVELLER: I'm all right.just some food.a
TIME TRAVELLER: Are you all right? Of course. I'm.all right. I didn't recognize you!.it was so dark.
TIME TRAVELLER: Meat.I'm hungry for meat!
DR. HILLYER: Well, can't you speak, man? What happened to you? Aren't you going to tell us.
BRIDEWELL: Leave him alone, can't you? It's all right. - I want to tell.
FILBY: It will keep, George. Eat, rest a No! I must tell it now. while I still remember.
TIME TRAVELLER: No! I must tell it now. while I still remember.
FILBY: Relax, try to relax a bit. You've all the time in the world.
TIME TRAVELLER: You're right, David. That's exactly what I have. - All the time in the world!. ever since we were all together five days ago, the last day of Eighteen Hundred Ninety Nine.
TIME TRAVELLER: ( continues ) I wanted to finish the job before the new century began. - I barely made it.
BRIDEWELL: DR. HILLYER ( stands up )
TIME TRAVELLER: Well, it has to do with time.
DR. HILLYER: ( steps to box ) I've always maintained what this nation needs is a reliable timepiece. The Navy needs one. The Army needs one. - For the artillery you know. Couldn't do better, George. So that's why you've been in hiding. - Clever of you, indeed! Traveller's reaction ) I don't believe George is referring to a new kind of timepiece.
TIME TRAVELLER: When I speak of time, I'm referring to the fourth dimension.
FILBY: Go on, George.
TIME TRAVELLER: Now, as you know, the difficulty in explaining the fourth dimension is that it cannot be seen or felt - it must be thought of.
FILBY: If you don't mind, George, would you refresh me on the first three Really, Filby, they must have taught you something at school! Suppose you explain it, Doctor.
DR. HILLYER: Really, Filby, they must have taught you something at school! Suppose you explain it, Doctor.
DR. HILLYER: ( he demonstrates When I move in a straight line, forward or backward, that's one dimension. - When I move to the left or right, two dimensions. - When I move up and down, three ( a bright idea lights up his face. At last he can get ahold of the box, but Filby interferes before Dr. Hillyer can get his fingers on it and he has to be satisfied with merely pointing ) For instance, this box has three dimensions: length, breadth, and Well, then, what's the fourth Well, that's.that's mere theory! No one can really say what the fourth dimension is or even that it exists.
DR. HILLYER: Well, that's.that's mere theory! No one can really say what the fourth dimension is or even that it exists.
TIME TRAVELLER: On the contrary, Doctor! The fourth dimension is as true and as real a dimension as any of the other three. In fact, they couldn't exist without it. How do you mean?
TIME TRAVELLER: Well, take that box. It has the first three dimensions, as you said. But what if it didn't exist in Time? It wouldn't exist at all, would it?
DR. HILLYER: TIME TRAVELLER DR. HILLYER ( impatiently )
TIME TRAVELLER: So - for an object to exist at all, it must exist in the fourth dimen- sion..and that fourth dimension is duration..Time! All right! But what's in that box?
TIME TRAVELLER: I'm coming to that. But first, consider! Why is it that we usually ignore the fourth dimension? Because we have no freedom to move in it. We can move in the other three up, down, forward, backward, sideways. But when it comes to Time, we are prisoners. Do you follow me, Anthony?
KEMP: George! You've given a most lucid explanation and all that! But I don't think I entirely understand.
TIME TRAVELLER: Look! There are a lot of things in the world you don't understand, aren't there?
KEMP: Of course! Quite a number.
TIME TRAVELLER: But you don't refuse to believe in them because of that?
KEMP: Not if I can see the proof with my own eyes.
TIME TRAVELLER: Good! All I'm asking you to do now is to witness a demonstration of the possibility of movement in the fourth dimension. Philip, will you please hand me that box?
TIME TRAVELLER: I've told you. The larger model can carry a passenger on a journey through Time. - Not through Space, mind you, but through Time.
BRIDEWELL: Oh, I say George! If you start floating around in the future, aren't you likely to mess things up for the rest of us?
DR. HILLYER: The future is already there. It's irrevocable and cannot be changed.
TIME TRAVELLER: That's the most important question to which I hope to find an answer. Can Man control his destiny? Can he change the shape of things to come?
TIME TRAVELLER: This experiment can be performed only once. If it succeeds, I lose my model forever. That is why I need witnesses.
KEMP: Go ahead.
TIME TRAVELLER: You're ready then?
TIME TRAVELLER: Doctor Hillyer, would you care to lend me your hand?
30 OUT: TWO SHOT 31 Dr. Hillyer slowly turns to the Time Traveller.
DR. HILLYER: Where did it go? Go? Nowhere in the usual sense. It's still here. But it's no longer in the present. It's traveling through time - to the future, to be precise.
DR. HILLYER: Do you seriously expect us to believe that?
TIME TRAVELLER: DR. HILLYER
DR. HILLYER: But you just said it hasn't really moved.
TIME TRAVELLER: That's correct.
DR. HILLYER: Then why can't we see it?
TIME TRAVELLER: Because we're in this room on December 31st, 1899, while the model you saw is perhaps a hundred years away. This room, or even this house, may no longer exist a hundred years from now. But the Time Machine is occupying the same space it did a moment before it went off on its journey. If it occupies the same space, I should be able to feel it.
TIME TRAVELLER: You must remember that the space you've just put your hand through is today's space. You can't put your hand into the space of Space is space! It doesn't change! The same space that is here now should be here a hundred or even a thousand years from now.
TIME TRAVELLER: No! Time changes space. This flat ground we're standing on now could have been at the bottom of the sea a million years ago. And a million years from now it could be the interior of a huge mountain.
KEMP: Suppose what you say is true. Exactly what do you suggest we do with such a contraption?
TIME TRAVELLER: For my part, I intend to take a journey into the future. - Unless someone else prefers to volunteer. I say, George. Suppose you go off and get lost in the fiftieth century! How will you find your way back? That's a calculated risk I'm prepared to take.
DR. HILLYER: Now listen, George! I don't know what you take us for, but we're not fools. There are a number of ways of doing a disappearing trick! But a man of your ability should not bother with such nonsense.
DR. HILLYER: Now you're being sensible. I'll take care of it first thing in the New Year.
DR. HILLYER: Well, time to go.
KEMP: Yes, we all have our plans for Are you all right, George?
TIME TRAVELLER: Of course, I am.
TIME TRAVELLER: Thanks for coming.
AD LIBS: Happy New Year. - Goodbye, George - Happy Twentieth Century. - Etc.
DR. HILLYER: Come on, Bridewell.
FILBY: I thought I'd better stay.
FILBY: No you're not. - You've been behaving oddly for over a month I'm not leaving until you tell me what's on your mind.
TIME TRAVELLER: I appreciate your gesture, David, but if you don't mind I'd rather you left me alone.
FILBY: You have changed, George. I'm sorry. Will you answer me one question I'll try.
TIME TRAVELLER: I'm sorry. Will you answer me one question I'll try.
TIME TRAVELLER: I'll try.
FILBY: Why this preoccupation with Time? Why not?
FILBY: Don't go simple on me, George! If you want to know the truth, I don't much care for the time I was born into. - It seems people aren't dying fast enough these days. They call upon science to invent new, more efficient weapons to depopulate the earth.
FILBY: I quite agree with you. But here we are and we have to make the best of it.
TIME TRAVELLER: You may have to. I don't. All right. Take a journey on your contraption. What would you become?. A Greek? A Roman? One of the I prefer the future.
TIME TRAVELLER: I prefer the future.
FILBY: You're not seriously saying you can do it?
TIME TRAVELLER: You saw the experiment this afternoon, didn't you?
FILBY: I saw a toy machine vanish. But I'm certain there are a number of ways of doing that trick. Any magician at the Hippodrome could probably do it. It was no trick! - Would you care to see the full-scale model?
FILBY: No, I would not! I have no desire to tempt the laws of Providence and I don't think you should. It's not for man to trifle with.
TIME TRAVELLER: Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp.
FILBY: There is something in their common sense attitude to life. George, I speak to you as a friend. More, as a brother. If that machine can do what you say it can.destroy it. Destroy it, George, before it destroys you.
TIME TRAVELLER: You must have plans for New Year's Eve. Don't let me keep you.
FILBY: Mary isn't well. We decided to stay home with the baby. But why don't you come home with me. You haven't seen little Jaime for a long time.
TIME TRAVELLER: I can't.
FILBY: What's stopping you?
TIME TRAVELLER: I just want to see the old century out by myself. Have it your own way.
FILBY: Will you promise me that you won't leave the house tonight?
TIME TRAVELLER: I promise you, I won't walk out of the door.
TIME TRAVELLER: David! Please don't think me un- friendly! - Come over to dinner - next Friday. Won't you?
FILBY: Very well.
TIME TRAVELLER: Fine.and will you bring the others with you? Whatever you say, George. - Happy New Year. And a very happy New Year to you, David.
MRS. WATCHETT: Will you be having supper in this evening, sir? I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett. Why don't you take the evening off and Thank you, sir, but if you won't be needing me I think I'll turn in early and get some sleep. .it I can. - Goodnight, sir.
MRS. WATCHETT: Thank you, sir, but if you won't be needing me I think I'll turn in early and get some sleep. .it I can. - Goodnight, sir.
TIME TRAVELLER: She turns to go as the Time Traveller calls after her.
TIME TRAVELLER: Oh, Mrs. Watchett! I've invited Mr. Filby and the others to dinner next Friday. Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.
MRS. WATCHETT: Happy New Year, sir.
ANIMATION ): As the sun arches majestically.
TIME TRAVELLER: ( positively ) Filby! I expected more of an enthusiastic greeting from. interrupts ) I'm afraid you have me confused with my father, sir. There was a remarkable resemblance. - I'm James Filby.
TIME TRAVELLER: JAMES FILBY
JAMES FILBY: Were you a friend of father's?
TIME TRAVELLER: Yes.yes.I've been away.
JAMES FILBY: He was killed in the war.a year No!.it can't be. I'm sorry to hear that. And the gentleman who used to live across the street?
JAMES FILBY: Oh, him. Some inventor who disappeared around the turn of the century. - If you're interested in that house, forget it. You can't buy it or even go inside.
TIME TRAVELLER: Why is that?
JAMES FILBY: My father was executor of the inventor's estate and he refused to liquidate it. I often chided him on that account, but he felt positive that the owner would return some day. - Some people hereabouts think it's haunted. Who are you, sir?
TIME TRAVELLER: Just a stranger who once knew your I see. Have you been at the front, sir?
JAMES FILBY: I see. Have you been at the front, sir?
TIME TRAVELLER: Front? What front?
JAMES FILBY: Why the war, of course.
TIME TRAVELLER: What war?
JAMES FILBY: Great heavens, man, don't you know we've been at war with Germany since nineteen fourteen? I thought perhaps you had seen action in France.or maybe. Perhaps a cup of tea would make you feel better. Won't you come in?
TIME TRAVELLER: No.no, thank you.
JAMES FILBY: You're sure you're alright, sir?
TIME TRAVELLER: Yes, I'm quite alright. Then.goodbye, sir.
TIME TRAVELLER: Goodbye, Jaime.
TIME TRAVELLER: Good heavens, that's a dress?
TIME TRAVELLER: ( shakes his head ) I can't understand you.
WARDEN: ( looking at helmet ) Confounded radio in this thing. Makes more noise than it does sense.
TIME TRAVELLER: ( recognizing him ) My name is Mister Filby. - Didn't you hear the air raid siren?
WARDEN: My name is Mister Filby. - Didn't you hear the air raid siren?
TIME TRAVELLER: You mean that horrible screeching?
WARDEN: It wasn't constructed for its aesthetic values, you know, but to warn silly young fools like yourself to get down into the shelter. Now go on.
TIME TRAVELLER: But I'm perfectly comfortable and I find your store magnificent. What splendid achievements, what gigantic strides mankind has taken, what.
WARDEN: ( interrupting ) Come on, young man. We'd better be going before the mushrooms start ( looks at Time Traveller with renewed interest ) You do look familiar. Haven't we met somewhere before?
TIME TRAVELLER: Indeed we have. Right here. Many years ago.
WARDEN: I was sure of that, but the exact time escapes me.
TIME TRAVELLER: It was two wars ago, I believe. Nineteen seventeen. Why now I recall. The chap who inquired about my father and the house that used to be across the way. But no.that's impossible. You haven't changed. You're not a day older. And your clothes.
TIME TRAVELLER: I'm afraid it's going to take me a little time to explain. You see.
WARDEN: The last alert.hurry!
TIME TRAVELLER: Listen to me! It's important. Look! An atomic satellite zeroing in! That's important!!
WARDEN: Hurry! Hide 'til the All Clear!
TIME TRAVELLER: All clear? I've got to talk to you.
TIME TRAVELLER: Well, and why not?
TIME TRAVELLER: Help her!.
TIME TRAVELLER: Are you all right?
THE GIRL: Why did you?
TIME TRAVELLER: Why did I what?
THE GIRL: Come after me. I did it to save your life, young lady, which I'm afraid doesn't hold much meaning for you or anyone else. It doesn't.
TIME TRAVELLER: Must have been fifty of your friends watching you drown. Not one of them so much as lifted a finger. - A curious attitude - in a curious Aren't you the least bit interested in what I am.where I come from? Should I be? Perhaps you'd better take me to someone a bit older I can talk to.
THE GIRL: There is no one older.
TIME TRAVELLER: Doesn't anyone age in this land of yours?
TIME TRAVELLER: What's your name?
THE GIRL: TIME TRAVELLER
TIME TRAVELLER: How do you spell that?
WEENA: TIME TRAVELLER
TIME TRAVELLER: Write! - Can't you write? Look!
TIME TRAVELLER: And what are your people called?
WEENA: Come. We must go in. Why? What's wrong? It is getting dark.
TIME TRAVELLER: In my time a berry this size would have made news in every civilized Sir, perhaps curiosity has died. Perhaps even courtesy has died, but I have come a long way and there are things I would like to know. Because I shall return to my time and they will ask questions such as what kind of government rules your We have no government. You must have a body of men who pass and enforce laws.
TIME TRAVELLER: Sir, perhaps curiosity has died. Perhaps even courtesy has died, but I have come a long way and there are things I would like to know. Because I shall return to my time and they will ask questions such as what kind of government rules your We have no government. You must have a body of men who pass and enforce laws.
TIME TRAVELLER: Because I shall return to my time and they will ask questions such as what kind of government rules your We have no government. You must have a body of men who pass and enforce laws.
TIME TRAVELLER: Doesn't anyone work?
TIME TRAVELLER: But it must be planted, cultivated, Unless you have an economy so well organized that you can devote all your time to study and experimentation. Am I right?
TIME TRAVELLER: Books will tell me what I want to know. Books will tell me all about
TIME TRAVELLER: Yes.they do tell me all about you! What have you done? Thousands of years of building and rebuilding creating and re-creating so that you can let it crumble to dust.
TIME TRAVELLER: What have you done? Thousands of years of building and rebuilding creating and re-creating so that you can let it crumble to dust.
TIME TRAVELLER: A million yesterdays of sensitive men dying for their dreams. For what? So you can swim and dance and play.
TIME TRAVELLER: I am returning to my time! Not to tell of the uselessness of the struggle - not to tell of the hopeless future - but only so that I can die among men!
WEENA: I heard you pounding.I came to tell you.
TIME TRAVELLER: How do you open that panel?
WEENA: No one opens it. Only the Morlocks.
TIME TRAVELLER: Morlocks? - Who are the Morlocks?
TIME TRAVELLER: Why are you afraid of the Morlocks?
TIME TRAVELLER: Tell me.
WEENA: When they call, we must go below.
TIME TRAVELLER: Do the Morlocks live beneath the Why must you obey their command?
WEENA: They give us the food we eat, the clothes we wear. We must do as they command.
TIME TRAVELLER: What happens to your people when they go below? No one knows. No one has ever It won't happen to you.
WEENA: It is night.
TIME TRAVELLER: Only children are frightened by the dark. - But then you are a child, aren't you? I'll build a fire. Let us go from here. I can't, child. My Machine is inside there, I intend to wait here 'til morning, then find some way of getting No, you must not. Help me gather some wood.
WEENA: Where are you from? As a matter of fact, I'm from right here. There's where my house stood many thousands of years ago. Here - to that monument, was my laboratory. About there was my library where I once sat talking with friends about my Time Machine.
TIME TRAVELLER: Get me a few more twigs.
TIME TRAVELLER: ( after calming her ) What was it? match and holds it to twigs ) This seems to keep them away.
WEENA: I never saw it before.
TIME TRAVELLER: ( after a long silence ) Do you know that the first thing which separated man from the rest of the mammals was his knowledge of ( he looks at her ) No, I suppose you don't. ( pokes at fire ) The next great stride came with the discovery of the wheel. ( turns to her ) Do you know what that is? ( she shakes her head ) I'm sorry I was angry with your people. I had no right to be. No more than if I had visited the Island of Bali in my own time. You were safe inside your great house, yet you came out into the night to warn me. The one characteristic which distinguished man from the animal kingdom was the spirit of self sacrifice. You have that quality, Girl. I'm sure all of your people have it. All it requires is someone to reawaken it. I shall try if you'll let me. Will I do not understand you, but I believe you.
WEENA: I do not understand you, but I believe you.
TIME TRAVELLER: That's a good start. - Now try to tell me.who or what are the Morlocks? Are they people or animals? What do you know about yourself? The past? Don't your people ever speak of the past?
WEENA: There is no past.
TIME TRAVELLER: Don't you ever wonder about the future?
WEENA: There is no future.
TIME TRAVELLER: Man's past is mainly a grim struggle for survival, but there have been moments when a few voices have spoken up. These rare moments have made the history of man a glorious thing. I refuse to believe it is dead and gone. We've had our dark ages before and this is only another of them. All you need is for someone to show you the way out. - I'm only a tinkering mechanic, but there must be this hidden spark in one of your people. If I can only kindle that spark, my coming here will have some meaning.
TIME TRAVELLER: ( pause ) Do you hear? ( straightening, amazed ) You mean those animals run machines?
TIME TRAVELLER: TIME TRAVELLER ( straightening, amazed )
WEENA: TIME TRAVELLER ( straightening, amazed )
TIME TRAVELLER: ( straightening, amazed ) You mean those animals run machines?
WEENA: They are Morlocks.
TIME TRAVELLER: ( as he walks to her ) I know, but have you seen the
WEENA: No, only heard of them.
TIME TRAVELLER: Who told you?
WEENA: The talking rings.
TIME TRAVELLER: ( moves closer to her ) What sort of rings?
WEENA: ( with a shrug ) Rings that talk.
TIME TRAVELLER: Can you show me these rings?
TIME TRAVELLER: ( picking up a ring ) Are these the talking rings?
WEENA: TIME TRAVELLER
TIME TRAVELLER: They speak?
WEENA: TIME TRAVELLER
TIME TRAVELLER: Of what?
WEENA: Things no one here understands.
TIME TRAVELLER: How do you get it to talk?
WEENA: No.don't go.please.
WEENA: You will not come back.
TIME TRAVELLER: I'll be back.
TIME TRAVELLER: Weena! Where are you, Girl?
TIME TRAVELLER: What's happening? Tell me!
TIME TRAVELLER: BACK TO ELOI 273 Featuring the Man in White in the f.g. They halt and stare back. The Time Traveller's voice comes over like a whip. None of the Eloi answer.
TIME TRAVELLER: What do you mean, all clear? All clear! Once..in the middle nineteen hundreds I heard a man. The falling bombs! That's over. Gone. Dead for hundreds of thousand of years. There are no more flying machines. No bombs. No wars!
TIME TRAVELLER: But you didn't listen. You didn't learn anything. All that is left is fear.a blind animal fear. Ages ago men were taught to hide in the ground when the sirens blew. taught to run from a raining death. but those men are dead! And so are the men who slaughtered them. Don't you understand? You are slaves of a dead past. You don't even own your souls. You're led to slaughter like sheep! But there is nothing to fear now, it's all clear.
TIME TRAVELLER: What about those who went below? How are they to come back?
TIME TRAVELLER: You can try. Won't any of you even try? Well, someone has to try!
T.T.'S VOICE: So, this was the destiny of the
T.T.'S VOICE: ( continuing ) They were being bred like cattle by the Morlocks who had degenerated into the lowest form of human
TIME TRAVELLER: Quick, something to burn! It's my last match!
TIME TRAVELLER: Weena! Weena, get the torch!
TIME TRAVELLER: Weena! Go on! Go on the
WEENA: Are you sorry? He STOPS WHISTLING, but the MUSIC CONTINUES. He turns.
TIME TRAVELLER: Sorry? - Sorry for what?
WEENA: That you have to stay.
TIME TRAVELLER: ( gazing into the night ) Yes. - I am sorry because I could tell so much to the people of my own time. I could tell them about the happiness and sorrow the future has in store for them. They could learn from it.or would they?
WEENA: You don't want to stay, do you?
TIME TRAVELLER: It isn't that, but I don't fit here anymore than you would in my time.
WEENA: ( a pause, and then ) I would like to see your time.
TIME TRAVELLER: No, Girl, you wouldn't be very happy there.
WEENA: Do you have someone like me - No. No one like you. But there are friends who will miss me. - As a matter of fact, I'm probably late No, men. There is a woman too, of course! She looks after my house for me. She is sixty-two years old. - Much older than you are. Weena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair into a new arrangement.
TIME TRAVELLER: No. No one like you. But there are friends who will miss me. - As a matter of fact, I'm probably late No, men. There is a woman too, of course! She looks after my house for me. She is sixty-two years old. - Much older than you are. Weena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair into a new arrangement.
WEENA: ( stealing a glance, then quietly ) No, men. ( teasing ) There is a woman too, of course! ( noticing her disappointment, he relents ) She looks after my house for me. She is sixty-two years old. - Much older than you are.
TIME TRAVELLER: No, men. There is a woman too, of course! She looks after my house for me. She is sixty-two years old. - Much older than you are. Weena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair into a new arrangement.
WEENA: ( suddenly ) How do they wear their hair?
TIME TRAVELLER: The women in your time.
WEENA: The women in your time.
TIME TRAVELLER: ( after a thought ) Up? - How?
WEENA: Up? - How?
TIME TRAVELLER: ( with awkward gesture ) Like this.
WEENA: Show me. The Time Traveller puts the flower back into his pocket, gets up and walks over to Weena.
WEENA: ( innocently ) Would I be pretty?
TIME TRAVELLER: ( slowly ) Yes.you would be. More than ( his voice sinks to a whisper ) I wish we could go back together, Weena, back to my own time.or to times before that when the world was young. We could.
DR. HILLYER: It is ridiculous! Simply preposterous!
BRIDEWELL: Well, there's one thing I'll say for you, George. You always could tell a good story. Best adventure yarn I've heard for years. You're a truly fine inventor, I'll turn down your bed for you!
MRS. WATCHETT: I'll turn down your bed for you!
KEMP: Truthfully, where have you been for the past week?
BRIDEWELL: ( voice of experience ) Now, we shouldn't ask such questions, Walter. It's not hard for a man to lose a week now and then. I understand your doubt. Take it as a lie if you wish. Now that I'm back I scarcely believe it ( a flash of memory ) Except that. ( groping in pocket ) .here are the flowers Weena gave A present for you, David.
FILBY: I don't think I can.
DR. HILLYER: Are you coming, Kemp.
KEMP: It's getting late and you look exhausted. You had better get some rest.
FILBY: Goodnight, George.
TIME TRAVELLER: Thank you, David, for being such a good friend - always.
KEMP: What do you think, Filby? One thing is certain. Those flowers couldn't have possibly bloomed in the winter-time. You don't really think that story was true?
FILBY: Look, you chaps go on. It's just a short walk home for me. Go on, driver!
FILBY: No answer. Then an odd HUMMING sound brings him to stiff attention. The SOUND INCREASES in VOLUME and PITCH until the entire house seems to tremble. Then a violent gust of wind blows open the door that leads to the laboratory. Filby pivots and runs up the steps, through the AT THE DOOR OF LABORATORY - FULL SHOT 424 Filby, dishevelled and out of breath, arrives and tries the door it is locked. The NOISE is almost DEAFENING. He puts his shoulder to the door and finally bursts it open. At the very instant he does so, the SOUND CEASES abruptly. He stops short, gazing aghast.
FILBY: I think I understand. - Look!
FILBY: But it isn't like George. - To return empty handed. To try to rebuild a civilization without a plan. He must have taken something with him.
MRS. WATCHETT: She looks around and discovers three empty spaces on the tightly packed book shelves. She walks to
MRS. WATCHETT: Nothing except three books.
FILBY: Which three books?
MRS. WATCHETT: I don't know. Is it important? No, I suppose not. - Only.what three books would you have taken?
MRS. WATCHETT: Mr. Filby, do you think he will ever return? One cannot choose but wonder. - You see.he has all the time in the world!
