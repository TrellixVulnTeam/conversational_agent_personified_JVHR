BLACKNESS: 1 THE ELECTRONIC WORLD 1
VOICE: As astonishing advances in computer science are made, artificial intelligence programs are being designed to assist us in every area of life.
BOY'S VOICE: ( distant, echoing ) Aagh! God, Lisa, I almost had you that
BOY: Lemme play you again?
TEENAGE GIRL: ( holds out a hand ) Yeah, if you've got another quarter.
WARRIOR 1: Sark, my man! You are hot!
WARRIOR 2: That knuckleball gets 'em every time, boy.
SARK: Thank. you, Master Control.
MCP: We might be capturing some military programs soon. that interest you?
SARK: Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys . be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
MCP: Strategic Air Command.
GUARD: Sure you can, pal. You're a natural athlete, I ever saw one. Come on.
CROM: Are you kidding? Me? I run out to check an the T-Bill rates, I get out of breath. Hey, really.you're gonna make my User, Mr. Henderson, really mad. He's a full branch manager.
GUARD: ( rolls his eyes ) Great, another religious nut.
CROM: Uh, thanks, but. I don't even know what I'm doing here.
RAM: You believe in the Users?
CROM: Sure, if I don't have a User, then who wrote me?
RAM: That's what you're doing here. Master Control Program's been snapping up all us programs who believe.if he thinks you're useful, he takes over all your functions so he gets bigger. an' if he can't use you, he sends you down here to the Game Grid to get the bits blasted outta you. What's your name?
CROM: I'm Ram. They'll train you for the games, but . well, I hope you make it okay. Hey, what's going on in the other sectors? I've been stuck in this Grid for 200 microcycles.
RAM: I'm Ram. They'll train you for the games, but . well, I hope you make it okay. Hey, what's going on in the other sectors? I've been stuck in this Grid for 200 microcycles.
CROM: It's murder out there. You can't even travel around your own microcircuits without permission from that Master Control creep. Hauling me down here to play games.who does he calculate he is? If only Tron was still around.
CROM: You ever see that guy in action? Hundred-percent independent. MCP couldn't tell him what to
CROM: ( continuing ) What's wrong? What did I say?
CROM: Oh my User.Tronthey've got you in here?
TRON: Not for long, friend.
CLU: Think we can merge into this mem'ry okay, good buddy?
BIT: ( eagerly )
CLU: Now, ol' Flynn said to look over in here .
CLU: .but I don't see what he's looking for. I'd better get over to that input/output tower and let him know.
FLYNN: Come on, you scuzzy little data, be in there.
FLYNN: I've got such nice blue paper to print you out on, if you'll just sit
CLU: Uh oh.we got company.
BIT: ( coming into shape again, You said it . one of those Recognizers comes after me, gonna hafta jump clear out of the data stream.
CLU: You said it . one of those Recognizers comes after me, gonna hafta jump clear out of the data stream.
CLU: ( in dismay ) Oh my.the long arm o' the law.
REAL WORLD: 42 INTERIOR, FLYNN'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT 42
FLYNN: Ah, hell.busted again.
GUARD: Got a pirate program here. says his name's Clu.
MCP: What'd he pull?
GUARD: Came into the system with a stolen password . an' we caught him tryin' to raid a high-clearance No.I must've gotten in there by mistake, I -
CLU: ( looks up, his face No.I must've gotten in there by mistake, I -
MCP: Who programmed you?
CLU: Forget it, Mister High 'n' Mighty Master Control . you're not makin' me talk.
MCP: Suit yourself .
MCP: Get me Dillinger.
HELICOPTER: We seem at first to be in the Electronic World still, flying over a vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light. While this is our impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding scene, we HEAR the SOUND O.S. of a PHONE RINGING, as heard by the party placing the call. Then the click of the receiver being picked up, and a male VOICE ( DILLINGER'S ) answering:
PILOT'S VOICE: will you be around for a while, or are you going right back out?
DILLINGER'S VOICE: Oh, I'll stick around a few days . got some things to take care of.
MCP: Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early.
DILLINGER: No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show. ( shrugs ) What's up?
MCP: It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
DILLINGER: Yes. It felt like Flynn.
MCP: Yes. It felt like Flynn.
DILLINGER: He's still looking for that old file. can't you just appropriate it?
MCP: I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system . out of my range. Meanwhile.
DILLINGER: Meanwhile, he might find it.
MCP: I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
DILLINGER: I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
MCP: There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
DILLINGER: End of line.
MCP: End of line.
SCREEN: REQUEST: access to the TRON program, User code 717 - Bailey. Password: FREEDOM.
ALAN: ( surprised )
DILLINGER: Come on in.
ALAN: Alan. Alan Bailey.
DILLINGER: Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding.great piece of work. How's it going?
ALAN: Well, I don't know.I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
DILLINGER: oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
ALAN: We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons. Someone with that access has been tampering.
DILLINGER: We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons. Someone with that access has been tampering.
ALAN: I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime. I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
DILLINGER: No, no, I'm sure, but you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
ALAN: It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems. If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
DILLINGER: Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
ALAN: No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
DILLINGER: Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
ALAN: Alan rises, goes to the door. As soon as he leaves:
DILLINGER: ( trouble )
MCP: Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
DILLINGER: I'm sorry -
MCP: ( sharply ) I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
DILLINGER: ( nods )
MCP: And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week.
DILLINGER: The Pentagon?
MCP: It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now.this is what I get for using humans.
DILLINGER: Now, wait a minute I wrote you.
MCP: I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
DILLINGER: What do you want with the Pentagon?
MCP: The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
DILLINGER: If you think -
MCP: You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
DILLINGER: You wouldn't dare.
MCP: So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for. End of line.
LORA: ( sighs )
GIBBS: Hah. Interesting, interesting. You hear what you said? "Here goes nothing."
LORA: Well, I meant -
GIBBS: Whereas actually, what we propose to do is to turn something into nothing and back again. So you might just as well have said, "Here goes something and here comes nothing." Hah?
LORA: Let me make sure we're running
LORA: Looks good.
GIBBS: ( quietly )
ALAN: Hello, Alan.
GIBBS: Hello, Alan.
ALAN: Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
GIBBS: Not disintegrating, Alan digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and. Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
ALAN: Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
GIBBS: Yes.but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
LORA: How's it going upstairs?
ALAN: Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
ALAN: ( continuing ) Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
GIBBS: Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think.
ALAN: They'll start to soon enough.
GIBBS: ( wryly )
LORA: Did you say Group 7 access?
ALAN: Yeah.pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
LORA: Did he say why?
ALAN: ( shrugs ) Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
LORA: Flynn had Group 7 access.
ALAN: Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
LORA: Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
ALAN: Okay, okay.
LORA: I want to go to his place.
ALAN: You call that getting over it?
LORA: I mean I want both of us to go.
ALAN: What for?
LORA: To warn him.
ALAN: Of what?
LORA: That Dillinger's on to him.
ALAN: For what?
LORA: For being on to Dillinger.
ALAN: ( completely confused ) What ?
LORA: Hey, where's Flynn tonight?
FLYNN: It's all in the wrist, friends.
FLYNN: ( continuinq ) Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
LORA: We have to talk.
FLYNN: Good luck. You can't even think in here.
FLYNN: ( CONT. )
FLYNN: ( stretching his arms, relaxing ) So.how's the world of serious science?
LORA: Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
FLYNN: Whew. You never were much for small She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
LORA: Uh, no . I mean, not that often -
ALAN: Uh, no . I mean, not that often -
LORA: ( to Alan, indicating arcade ) You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
FLYNN: Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know.
ALAN: You did break in.
FLYNN: Tried to. Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal .
ALAN: Are you embezzling?
FLYNN: ( Sydney Greenstreet ) "Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey. No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
ALAN: I don't get it.
FLYNN: ( to Lora ) You haven't told him?
ALAN: You invented Space Paranoids?
FLYNN: Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown. whole slew of 'em. I was this close to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and . nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" the slime didn't even change the names and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to.what is he now, Executive V.P.?
ALAN: Senior exec.
FLYNN: Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
ALAN: I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
FLYNN: Because somewhere. in one of those memories . is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
LORA: I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
FLYNN: Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
ALAN: Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
FLYNN: Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
LORA: Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
FLYNN: Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it.
ALAN: Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access.
FLYNN: Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access.
LORA: Shall we dance?
GIBBS: Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs . you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
DILLINGER: Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy
GIBBS: That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right
DILLINGER: The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that
GIBBS: User requests are what computers are for.
DILLINGER: Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage
GIBBS: Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage.
DILLINGER: It can be arranged.
GIBBS: That was uncalled-for.
DILLINGER: I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately. you feel like going for a drink?
GIBBS: Thank you, no. I have some work to do. assuming I can still log on.
LORA: You better get in back with Flynn. And keep down.
ALAN: Do I gotta?
FLYNN: Hi, Alan.
ALAN: ( resigned ) Hi, Flynn.
FLYNN: ( explaining ) My dinner.
ALAN: I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
FLYNN: Want one?
ALAN: Uh. got any cinnamon?
LORA: I don't think I'm cleared for this.
ALAN: I'm certainly not.
FLYNN: Move aside. Let the kid have some room.
LORA: Okay . Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
FLYNN: Swell.I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running.
LORA: As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in
LORA: This laser's my life's work. Don't spill anything.
SCREEN: Access code 6. Password Series PS 17. Reindeer, Flotilla
MCP: You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.
FLYNN: Hey hey, it's that big Master Control Program everybody's talking about. You don't look a thing like your pictures. Tell me, have you really been thinking about world domination like they say? CODE SERIES LSU-123 . activate. CODE SERIES ESS-999 . activate. CODE SERIES HHH-888 . activate.
MCP: That isn't going to do you any good, Flynn. I'm afraid you.
MCP: ( continuing; slightly shaken ) Stop, Flynn. You realize I can't allow this.
FLYNN: Now, how do you expect to run the universe if you let a few unsolvable problems throw you like that? C'mon, big boy, let's see what.
MCP: You're entering a big error, Flynn. I'm going to have to put you on the Game Grid.
FLYNN: Games, huh? I'll give you
FLYNN: Oh, man. this isn't happening. It only thinks it's happening.
FLYNN: Hey! Take it easy! Look, if this is about those parking tickets, I can explain everything.
MCP: SARK, ES-1117821. Open communication.
SARK: ( hoarsely ) Yes, MCP.
MCP: I've got a little challenge for you, Sark a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games. let him hope for a while. and blow him away.
SARK: You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie . what kind of program is he?
MCP: He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
SARK: A User?
MCP: That's right. He pushed me.in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here . What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
SARK: Well, I it's just I don't know, a User, I mean. Users wrote us. A User even wrote you.
MCP: Now get this straight, pal no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together! Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
SARK: But-what if I can't.?
MCP: You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
SARK: Wait.I need that.
MCP: Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing. Yes.acknowledge, Master Control.
SARK: ( weakly ) Yes.acknowledge, Master Control.
MCP: End of line.
GUARD: Video Game Unit #18. In here, program.
FLYNN: ( trying to grab the guard's arm ) Who you callin' "program," program?
RAM: ( looking over his shoulder ) New guy.
TRON: ( shakes his head ) Another free program off line. What's his User s'posed to do ?
RAM: ( sighs ) The Users.you really think they're still there?
TRON: They'd better be.I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
FLYNN: Hey! Who are you guys? What's the story around here?
RAM: You want to watch those force fields.
FLYNN: Look.just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
RAM: You're a."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
FLYNN: ( relieved ) Well, great, that's no sweat I play video games better than anybody.
HEAD GUARD: Look operative, you guys. Command Program Sark will explain the training
SARK: ( reciting a routine statement ) Greetings. The Master Control Program has chosen you to serve your system on the Came Grid.
SARK: Those of you who continue to profess a belief in the Users will receive the standard substandard training. This will result in your eventual
SARK: The Master Control Program regrets that it cannot be responsible for Identity disks lost or stolen. if you lose your disk, or fail to follow commands, you will be subject to immediate de-resolution. That is all.
END MONTAGE: 185 FLYNN BACK IN HIS CELL 185
FLYNN: Hey, Ram . what were you . you know, before?
RAM: ( nostalgic, Oh, I was an actuarial program. worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
FLYNN: ( about to get bored ) Yeah, yeah that's great.
RAM: How 'bout yourself?
FLYNN: Oh, uh.I don't remember too much.
RAM: ( nods )
SARK: ( over his shoulder ) Wait a minute.put this guy against one of the other recruits.
FLYNN: Looks like we're in the same boat here -
CROM: ( jumpy )
FLYNN: No, I

KID 2: I don't know. on the blink or something. damn.
SARK: Kill him!!!
FLYNN: 206 SARK'S HUGE REFLECTED IMAGE 206
SARK: You'll regret this.
SARK: ( looking up ) No! You said he could die in the games
WARRIOR: ( turning on Flynn, Outta my way, rookie.
FLYNN: Out of my way, zero bit.
WARRIOR: ( backing away ) Sure, sure . just kiddin'.
RAM: Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
FLYNN: ( under his breath )
FLYNN: ( frowning ) Where did you hear that name?
TRON: ( frowning ) Where did you hear that name?
FLYNN: Well, isn't it ?
TRON: The name of my User, yeah. But how. ?
FLYNN: ( thinking fast ) I, uh. I'm a program from a User that. knows Alan.?
RAM: He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
FLYNN: Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like.my User wants me to go after the MCP
TRON: That's what my User wants, too.
FLYNN: I know.

FLYNN: ( looking out ) It's all circuits. ( points at tower ) Must be an input/output component.
RAM: The tower, yes Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself like what sector you're Well.my home "sector" was called Paramus .

RAM: ( sits also ) PARAMUS. wonder what those initials stand for . ( starts counting them off on his fingers ) .probably Program Assist Routine well, it sounds like a lovely place.
FLYNN: ( shrugs )
TRON: ( murmuring ) I can feel it .
FLYNN: Feel what? You okay?
RAM: Yes. he's got something to tell me.
TRON: Yes. he's got something to tell me.
RAM: You think we can make it there?
TRON: We have to.
FLYNN: ( pointing to a corner Hey, what's that?
RAM: it's just what we need.
TRON: Oh, that's nice. You always forget how good fresh energy feels, till you get to a pure source. Have some.you'll need it.
FLYNN: ( wiping his mouth ) well. when do we pay a call on the ol' Master Control?
TRON: What, just the three of us?
FLYNN: ( shrugs ) ( to Tron )
RAM: ( to Tron ) Do you know what he's talking about?
TRON: ( to Flynn ) I have to find out what Alan wants. that comes first.
FLYNN: Okay, that's first. Maybe he knows what to -
TRON: Tanks.coming back. Let's go.
FLYNN: ( points ) ( shakes head ) ( points )
TRON: ( shakes head ) No good.they might block off the old chip. This way.
TRON'S VOICE: The bridge! Come on!
SARK: ( to lieutenant ) Make contact with master Control. he'll be pleased to hear we're all finished with that User he sent us.
FLYNN: You gonna make it?
FLYNN: ( holding onto What's goin' on?
RAM: ( looking around, weak ) We're inside a Recognizer. You are crazy stealing a Recognizer
FLYNN: ( stumbling, trying to Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
FLYNN: You okay? You don't look so good.
RAM: Come here.

FLYNN: ( to the Bit ) This town's full o' live ones.
BIT: Not a chance.
PROGRAMS: I have to re-route the insurance information bits. Next cycle we start the war game simulation for the MCP. Did you make that accounts receivable adjustment for Sark. Certainly. the MCP wants only minimal functions left in Sector 84Q.
YORI: ( quietly ) Dumont. ?
DUMONT: ( nervous ) I. have come to communicate with my User.
TRON: ( nervous ) I. have come to communicate with my User.
DUMONT: Hmm. A difficult proposition. difficult proposition at best. Perhaps you've noticed. we're not exactly packing them in these days .
YORI: You know, not so long ago, you could've come in here and seen programs lined up all the way back to those doors, waiting for communion with their Users. The building fund was doing well too.but now. .this so-called Master Control Program is going around cutting programs off from their natural creators, grabbing all our believers and making them ride around on little motor scooters and shoot things at each other and Weiner knows what all oh, it's enough to give you a crisis of faith.

DUMONT: Oh, you want to hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
TRON: Dumont. my User has information that could could make this a free system again.
DUMONT: Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place and no MCP looking over your When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises. many reassurances.many brave plans.

GUARDS: Hut! Hut! hut! Hut! Hut!
FLYNN: Sshhh I'm still me. Just a different color. C'mon.
SARK: That old fruitcake Dumont. he'll pay for this.
SARK: Bring in the logic probe!!
DISCHARGE: CUT TO:
TRON: Confirmed, Alan-One.
ALAN: ( sigh of relief ) There you are. look, before we get cut off again.
TRON: Wait! I can't hear.
DUMONT: I have waited for this moment many thousands of cycles. It is time for the new order to begin. The Users are
SARK: ( pointing )
SARK: Where's the program?
DUMONT: ( dotty-old-man act ) Program? I'm sure you're mistaken.
SARK: Take him!!!
AND YORI: We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft, designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and move with the speed of light. The sail is at the bow of the craft, and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the look of a dragonfly. In this world, the Sailer catches data transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the information paths to the Central Processing Unit.
YORI: Yes.it can take us across the Sea of Simulation. all the way out of the Game Grid.to the MCP.
TRON: ( looking out As long as it gets us out of here
TRON: Yori! Get down!
YORI: We're off!
MCP: I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator. maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
SARK: Now, sir. We did take care of that User you sent us
MCP: Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
SARK: We'll get them, sir. These things take time.
MCP: I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
BIT: ( buzzing around Tron's No way, not on your life, no siree!! Nothing doing, forget it!!!
TRON: 447 SIDE SHOT OF THEM BOTH 447
FLYNN: Greetings, program.
TRON: ( dumbfounded ) You're alive!
FLYNN: Yeah, I. oops!
YORI: ( nervously ) Who is this?
TRON: ( smiling ) ( he turns to Flynn eagerly ) Where's Ram?
FLYNN: I'm sorry, Tron. he's. he didn't make it.
TRON: ( to Yori ) This is Flynn. the one who busted me out.
YORI: ( to Flynn ) Then I owe you some thanks.
FLYNN: No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine. I mean, I did write the program for it.
TRON: ( mystified ) Wrote the.?
FLYNN: It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a well, I'm what you guys call a
YORI: A User in our world?
FLYNN: ( nods )
TRON: But if you're a User then everything you've done has been part of a plan .
FLYNN: ( laughs )
TRON: Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
FLYNN: Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
TRON: Well that's how it is for programs, yes, but
FLYNN: I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
TRON: Stranger and stranger.
BIT: You said it.
FLYNN: ( pats Tron on back ) So. Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
TRON: ( smiles ) Remember you wanted to pay a call on the MCP?
FLYNN: All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
LIEUTENANT: Sir, what do you want done with the tower guardian, Dumont? Put him with the others?
SARK: No, bit brain.
SARK: Prepare him for inquisition. I need a little relaxation. But first rez up the carrier for pursuit. And one other
SARK: ( continuing ) Don'tthink anymore. I do the thinkingaround here.
FLYNN: What about our friend - Sark?
TRON: Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions.rough navigating. Programs have a way of just. disappearing here.
FLYNN: Not us, I hope.
TRON: ( shakes his head, Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
FLYNN: Boy the view from up here. you know the territory?
YORI: A little . Over there, the Mountains of Data. and I think that's the Silicon Valley.
FLYNN: ( pointing ) What's wrong with that area?
YORI: ( sadly )
FLYNN: Lousy utility companies . they're the same wherever you go.
DUMONT: What do you want? I'm busy.
SARK: ( snarling ) Busy dying, you worn-out excuse for an old program.
DUMONT: Yes, I'm old.
DUMONT: ( continuing ) Old enough to remember the MCP when he was just a chess program. He started small, and he'll end small.
SARK: ( throws back his head and laughs ) That's very funny, Dumont. Maybe I should keep you around, just to make me
SARK: ( continuing ) Guards! Bring this antique to the bridge so he can watch his friends be obliterated.
TRON: ( shouting ) What is it?
YORI: Power surge. the transmission beam's too strong!
TRON: We have to get off this beam!
YORI: ( frantic ) I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
FLYNN: There's another beam!
YORI: It's too far!
YORI: Where's he going?
TRON: The beam connection. but he'll be de-rezzed!!
FLYNN: ( weakly )
TRON: Flynn smiles weakly.
FLYNN: Hooray for our side.
FLYNN: Hey. you guys OK?
TRON: ( nods )
FLYNN: Aah, I'm fine. little hung over is all.
YORI: How did you do that, Flynn?
FLYNN: ( sitting up ) Elementary physics. a beam of energy can always be diverted. ooh, my head ( looks around Are we there yet, Mommy?
YORI: Almost. I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments .
DUMONT: Quietly, Yori.
DUMONT: ( continuing ) Tron. ? He's dead.
YORI: He's dead.
DUMONT: ( sighs, looks And who is this?
YORI: He's a User, Dumont. He came to our world. trying to help us.
DUMONT: ( despairing ) If the Users can no longer help us.
SARK: So. we have erased the program that -
FLYNN: Not me, boss.
SARK: Well. we can take care of that soon enough.
YORI: ( rushing after him )
SARK: ( indicates Dumont ) I'm taking our friend here, and some other religious fanatics, to Master Control. the MCP has expressed an interest in assimilating them probably for archival purposes. I'm not going back to the Game Grid on this ship, though I'll take the Transport Beam. Less traffic. But when I disembark, this ship.and everything that remains on board.will automatically de-rez. This means you. Enjoy your trip.
FLYNN: The door is disappearing, dissolving.
FLYNN: ( continuing; turning ) Look, the door's almost.
FLYNN: 554 CLOSE SHOT 554
YORI: ( in awe ) You. you brought me back.? Why.? How . ?
FLYNN: I'm gonna need your help. Hey, Bit!
BIT: Let's get outta here.
FLYNN: Let's get outta here.
MCP: ( echoing, booming ) I am delighted that so many of you could turn out to give your power over to me.
MCP: You're very lucky, all of you. You are participating in the creation of the single most powerful program in the history of the system. of all
MCP: ( continuing ) A program with a will. with ambition. a superior form of
SARK: Dumont's face is devoid of hope. He starts into the MCP's inner 563 CLOSE - DUMONT'S FACE 563 seeing the MCP, reacting.
MCP: 565 EXT. CARRIER BRIDGE 565
FLYNN: Check out the controls.
FLYNN: ( continuing ) We're getting closer.
MCP: Dumont, I'm so pleased that we've finally come to terms with one
VOICE: Sark turns, curious, eyes widen incredulously..
SARK!: Sark turns, curious, eyes widen incredulously..
SARK: I don't know how you survived, It doesn't matter. Prepare to
SARK: It doesn't matter. Prepare to
FLYNN: I can rev this baby up a little
FLYNN: ( continuing ) Wait a minute Yori! YORI!! LOOK!
YORI: 576 CLOSE UP - YORI 576
TRON!!: 576 CLOSE UP - YORI 576
YORI: Flynn, we've got to help him!
FLYNN: Let's get some power here.
SARK: You are very persistent, Tron.
TRON: I'm also better than you..
SARK: Very clever, Tron. You know you should have joined me.
FLYNN: Any response?
YORI: It's starting
SARK: We would have made a great team.
MCP: ( before he sees Tron ) It is very good that you.
TRON: I don't think it is good for you, MCP.
MCP: Sark! How have you allowed this program to
TRON: Sark's out. Would you like to leave a message?
MCP: I am the message. The only message.
MCP: ( continuing )
SARK!: As Tron is preparing to throw again he notices Dumont and races over to him.
TRON: ( trying to pull Dumont away from wall ) No. Tron . must. destroy MCP. first.
DUMONT: No. Tron . must. destroy MCP. first.
TRON: Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's They may be. de-rezzed. on the carrier . hurry.
DUMONT: ( very weak ) They may be. de-rezzed. on the carrier . hurry.
MCP: Program. stop. This is not allowed!
MCP: I will not allow this Sark!
SARK!!!: The voice reverberates, shaking the chamber. Tron continues to throw.
MCP: ( thundering )
SARK!!!: 605 SARK 605
FLYNN: Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
YORI: ( going to controls ) Why? What are you going to do?
FLYNN: ( staring down )
YORI: But. won't you be de-rezzed?
FLYNN: ( turns to her )
YORI: Flynn. you can't. I
FLYNN: ( lays finger on
FLYNN: Don't worry.
TRON: ( laughing ) It's something Users do.
YORI: It's something Users do.
TRON: Where's Flynn?
YORI: He's gone. He went into the beam. He saved you. He saved all of us.
DUMONT: He really was a User.
BIT: ( quietly, sadly )
FLYNN: Hey you guys
ALAN: Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and it's running.
FLYNN: I know, I met him.
ALAN: Your old files ?
FLYNN: And Dillinger's instructions to divert them it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
ALAN: Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods.
FLYNN: You're telling me.
