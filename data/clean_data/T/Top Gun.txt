LSO: LEVEL.YOUR WINGS. EASY. YOU'RE SETTLING..FLY THE BALL. A wind shear just off the ramp drives the plane suddenly down.
LSO: POWER.POWER!..POWER!.WAVE OFF! WAVE OFF WAVE OFF! AFTERBURNERS BLAST, but the Tomcat horrifyingly settles tail-low toward the deck. The deck crew watches in terror as the plane wallows in toward them. The LSO'S turn, take a few steps and throw themselves off the flight deck.

LSO: COUGAR, GOOSE.COME IN COUGAR! SHUT YOUR ENGINES DOWN, YOU'VE GHOST RIDER! ACKNOWLEDGE! GHOST RIDER! ACKNOWLEDGE! Crash crew leaps into action. The fire crew is there. The man in the Silver Suit jumps up on the wing and crawls to the cockpit. The figures inside are not moving. He hits the canopy release. The canopy pops open. Silver suit grabs at the rear seat harness release. He screams through his suit's aluminized cloth.

SILVER SUIT: Goose, can you hear me? Goose!
GOOSE: Oh, Hello. Valet parking?
SILVER SUIT: Son of a bitch!
GOOSE: You will put it up front, with the Porsches?
GOOSE: Hey.easy.Take it easy. I'm a veteran!
GOOSE: Can you check under the hood. I thought I heard a funny noise.
GOOSE: Lucy.Ricky.I'n Home!
GOOSE: Is it extra for the hot wax?

GOOSE: Well.there goes your tip.
WIZARD: It's Goose. He's alright. Bring it left.You're settling. IS THE
DECK CLEAR?: LSO ( V.O. filtered )
GOOSE: On behalf of your Captain and your crew, I want to thank you for flying VF101. And next time your plans include the middle of the goddamn ocean in the dead of frigging night, I hope you'll think of Naval Aviation.
SURGEON: Stress reaction.
XO: Check his head.
GOOSE: ( wobbling off ) Never mind my head, check my 32. SICK BAY - LATER Cougar lies alone in the dimness, staring at the overhead.
STINGER: 34. STINGER'S CABIN The skipper works at his desk, responds without looking up.
STINGER: Come in.
STINGER: Cougar, what is it? You should be in sick bay. What are you doing?
COUGAR: Thinking of my wife and kid.
34A. OMITTED: Something metal hits it, skids across the polished surface and clangs up against the coffee mug: gold wings.
GOOSE: He stops, turns to them. There is nothing to say. Goose hands him his snapshot. Cougar looks at his wife and kid for a moment, then looks up at them. He turns away.
MAVERICK: Cougar? STINGER ( O.S. ) Maverick, Goose.Come in here.
MAVERICK: The Skipper says nothing. Maverick sees the wings on the desk. He enters, walks over, stares down at them. He picks them up.
GOOSE: Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
STINGER: He's a good pilot.
MAVERICK: He's a good pilot.
STINGER: I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
GOOSE: He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
STINGER: Was going. ( Turns to Maverick. ) Now you are.
MAVERICK: Was going. ( Turns to Maverick. ) Now you are.
STINGER: Was going. ( Turns to Maverick. ) Now you are.
MAVERICK: Maverick stares at the wings, lost in conflicting emotions.
STINGER: Well, he's going ( indicating Goose ) and he needs someone to fly the Skipper, you can't do this!
GOOSE: Skipper, you can't do this!
STINGER: I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too.
GOOSE: Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go The Skipper stares at Goose, non-plussed for a moment.
STINGER: I know some RIOS are a little wiggy.but you abuse the priviledge! I don't believe I'm going to have to put the two of you in the same cockpit.but there it is! It may be good for the Navy. It might be good for you, but most of all, it's good for me. It'll get you out of my sight.
GOOSE: But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun.He's the best of the Well, you'll just have to make do with him ( indicates Maverick ).
STINGER: Well, you'll just have to make do with him ( indicates Maverick ).
GOOSE: Mav's a great flyer but..
STINGER: He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing. ( SCREAMS ) He just can't seem to follow orders!
STINGER: You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe .too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
MAVERICK: That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time.
STINGER: That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time.
MAVERICK: Yes sir!
STINGER: He turns back.
MAVERICK: Yes sir..
STINGER: The wings..
STINGER: His facade cracks just slightly.
STINGER: Good luck.
CHP: Son. Do you know why I stopped you?
MAVERICK: Yes sir. I do sir
CHP: Well. What is it?
MAVERICK: ( more than sincere ) Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
CHP: License and registration.
CHP: Lieutenant, do you know how fast you were going?
MAVERICK: Yes sir. I do, Sir.
CHP: Sir. I was going Mach point one CHP nods sagely.
MAVERICK: Sir. I was going Mach point one CHP nods sagely.
CHP: One SIXTH the speed of sound!
MAVERICK: Yes sir.
CHP: ( a guess ) Lieutenant. What do you. usually fly?
MAVERICK: F-14's sir.
CHP: ( new respect ) Yes sir!
MAVERICK: Yes sir!
CHP: Lieutenant. Is there. a Russian attack?
MAVERICK: No sir! But you have to be ready.
CHP: Maverick turns to him.
MAVERICK: Yes, Sergeant?
CHP: Remember one thing.
MAVERICK: Outside of this gate. I.am Top Gun.
CHP: Outside of this gate. I.am Top Gun.
MAVERICK: Yes sir!
ICE: Uh oh, police escort. This one must be a real killer.
VIPER: By the end of Vietnam we upped our kill ratio to thirteen to one.
VIPER: You're here 'cause you're the top one per cent of all naval aviators.
THE CLASS: Sixteen young men - eight flight crews - sit at attention. They are trim, fit and confident - high school heroes, college jocks.
VIPER: .Someone once asked me if training men for air combat made the world less safeflying loaded guns. an accidental confrontation and so forth.
GOOSE: ( whispers ) What are you doing?
MAVERICK: Nothing.That's McGown.that's Singer, isn't it?
GOOSE: Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
MAVERICK: ( musing to himself ) .Just wondering.( turns back ) .who is the best.
VIPER: Really. ( smiles ) Ya know. We'd like to know who's best too. That's why we've got that plaque on the wall. with the Top Top Gun crew from each class. You think maybe your name's gonna be on Maverick knows he's in trouble, considers the social alternatives, then tells him the truth.
MAVERICK: Yes sir.
VIPER: Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
MAVERICK: ( somewhat chastised ) Yes sir.
VIPER: I like that in a fighter pilot. ( couple of laughs from the guys ) It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of Viper gathers his notes, the lecture is over.
MAVERICK: Yes sir.
VIPER: Gentlemen, this is about combat. Remember, there are no points for second place. Dismissed. Viper walks out. Maverick finds Goose looking at him, quizzically. Others mill around the plaque. A big, friendly bear of a RIO speaks.
WOLFMAN: A plaque?
HOLLYWOOD: It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
A7 PILOT: You know the Fighter Pilots motto? It's better to be dead than to look They grin broadly. Goose replies as they brush past.
GOOSE: I don't know, Frank, anybody gets off on bombing the shit out of dirt has got to be queer.
GOOSE: Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
MAVERICK: Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
GOOSE: Gotta keep track of the Goose suddenly reaches out and grabs a guy moving past.
GOOSE: Slider they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
SLIDER: Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
GOOSE: The list is long, but So's my Johnson.
SLIDER: So's my Johnson.
GOOSE: This is Maverick.
SLIDER: So I've heard.
GOOSE: Who's your pilot?
SLIDER: Tom Kazansky.
GOOSE: ( very impressed ) No shit. The Iceman..
SLIDER: Mister to you.
GOOSE: You think you can stay up with us.
SLIDER: I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
GOOSE: This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
SLIDER: So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
MAVERICK: Still is..
SLIDER: Yeah. That's what I meant.
SLIDER: What was that?
GOOSE: Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart . and other things depending on where you spill it.
GOOSE: You can't show fear in front of Marines.They're like Doberman's they'll go for your throat, it's He takes out match and lights it. Maverick holds his arm.
MAVERICK: You ever done this before?
GOOSE: What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
SLIDER: How was it?
GOOSE: Could use a dash more jet fuel.
GOOSE: Careful, don't make an ash of He tries to drink the flaming concoction. He tries to go for a sip, but it's too close to his face, he tries to tilt the flame away, but that doesn't work. Finally he goes for the gulp. He burns his lip and misses. He sets his hair on fire. It goes up in a WHOOOSH!!
SUNDOWN: Mayday! Down in flames!
GOOSE: Mayday! Down in flames!
SUNDOWN: Thanks, I needed that.
HOLLYWOOD: You guys are not only crazy, you're Ice comes up from the end of the bar. He motions the Barmaid for another; it comes. Goose lights it. He gulps it down, cool as Frat boys.
ICE: ( Disdainfully ) Frat boys.
MAVERICK: Who is that guy?
HOLLYWOOD: That's Kazanski.
GOOSE: No shit! That why they call him Ice?
HOLLYWOOD: Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. No mistakes. Wears you down. After enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you.
GIRL: Why do you all have such funny You gotta have a call sign that's just your own.never changes.you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
WOLFMAN: You gotta have a call sign that's just your own.never changes.you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
GIRL: Why do they call you Wolf?
WOLDFMAN: ( smiles ) Oh, I don't know.
GOOSE: Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
MAVERICK: Yeah, he's marriedbut then again, he,s not dead.
GIRL: Could I get a call sign?
WOLFMAN: Well, I don't know. That depends.
GIRL: On what?
WOLFMAN: Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
GIRL: Like what?
WOLFMAN: Oh.I'll think of something.
ICEMAN: Figured it out yet?
MAVERICK: Figured out what?
ICEMAN: Who is the best.
MAVERICK: Need a hint?
ICEMAN: Need a hint?
MAVERICK: I think I can work it out on my You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
ICEMAN: You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
MAVERICK: I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
ICEMAN: And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
MAVERICK: He's a good man.
ICEMAN: The best.
SLIDER: You must have soloed under a lucky star. First the MiG, then you slide into Cougar's place.
GOOSE: It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
ICE: What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
GOOSE: Did what?
ICE: Got you here.
GOOSE: We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.
SLIDER: What luck! Guys fly their whole career without seeing a MiG up close.You're famous.
ICE: You mean notorious.
MAVERICK: What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
GOOSE: Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
BUGS: We were just really diving down and by then we were right over downtown Haiphong. It was some great shit. Jack says, "What are you doing?" "What, what am I doing, Jack?" He says, "What are you doing?" I said, "I'm rolling in, Jack." "Bugs, we're at thirty-two hundred feet. Oh shit, we were like zooom. So we scraped down at hundred feet right overdowntown Hanoi! Oh shit, goddamn it! And blowing down the river. And so once we were there we let down to about fifty feet just going down the river and Jack says. "Bugs. don't ever do that again!" "Okay, right, Jack, I'll never do that again!"
MAVERICK: What, what is it?
HOLLYWOOD: Target passing. Check your six.
MAVERICK: Never mind mine. Check hers.
HOLLYWOOD: Her six is a ten! Uh oh, a turn to HIS POV - ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM Maverick sees a stranger, and somehow he knows, he knows even then. Wolfman turns, sees her walking too.
WOLFMAN: Bogey.9 o'clock level.
SUNDOWN: Nine thirty. Bogey? You presume that hostile?
HOLLYWOOD: Well, we should contact and check it out.
GOOSE: The family unit that's the most important thing. It's the only thing you can count on. I'm married did I tell you that?
FIRST GIRL: Four times. We don't believe you.
GOOSE: I've been married since I was eighteen. Why don't you believe me?
SECOND GIRL: Because you don't look married.
FIRST GIRL: You're not even wearing a ring.
GOOSE: ( big smile ) I take it off when I'm chasing women. It's the only honorable thing to do.
HOLLYWOOD: You don't think about death up there, but you think a lot about the danger. One mistake and you're a smoking hole in the ground.
GIRL: I never knew it was so dangerous.
HOLLYWOOD: Oh yeah, it makes everything down here more meaningful. You feel a certain intensity of life, and you want to grab onto every moment.
CHARLIE: Long cruise, was it?
CHARLIE: Anything I can do to help, Lieutenant?
MAVERICK: Lots of things.
CHARLIE: I'll bet!
MAVERICK: Uhhh.Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is.could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
CHARLIE: Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
CHARLIE: Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this.is ridiculous.
MAVERICK: It's not that.
CHARLIE: It isn't?
MAVERICK: Well, it is. It is that, too.
CHARLIE: That's a big comfort to me.
MAVERICK: I could be, too.
CHARLIE: How so?
MAVERICK: Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
CHARLIE: And on to a bigger one with you?
MAVERICK: Yeah, most likely.
CHARLIE: Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
MAVERICK: I heard of one once.
CHARLIE: I'm really flattered, Lieutenant, but I don't go out with pilots.
MAVERICK: Then what are you doing here?
CHARLIE: I think the question is.what are She tries to keep a straight face as she walks out of the room.
MAVERICK: Hi. I'm here to talk about a new concept in cosmetics.
CHARLIE: She sees it's him.
MAVERICK: My fault. Should have watched where I was going.
CHARLIE: Where's your wing man? Who's watching your six?
MAVERICK: Uh, nobody, I guess.
CHARLIE: Too bad.
CHARLIE: See you around.
MAVERICK: Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
CHARLIE: I'm with someone.
MAVERICK: I thought he'd never leave.
CHARLIE: Startled, she nearly drives off the road. She turns to him, You! What are you doing here?
CHARLIE: You! What are you doing here?
MAVERICK: Everybody's got to be somewhere.
CHARLIE: What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
MAVERICK: It would have been really How did you know this was my car?
CHARLIE: How did you know this was my car?
MAVERICK: Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish.It's your color.matches your lipstick.
CHARLIE: That's all!
MAVERICK: And I asked someone.
CHARLIE: You think you're pretty smart.
MAVERICK: I think I'm in love.
MARINE: Can I help you, Ma'am?
CHARLIE: I don't know, Corporal. Can you do anything about this lunatic?
FLEX: Not so fast.my head.
JESTER: Who are you?
SUNDOWN: I'm Sundown.
JESTER: Yeah, right. You're late.
VIPER: And who are you?
FLEX: Flex.? You don't look like Flex to me. You call that muscle? Doesn't look like muscle. Looks They laugh. Even Sundown has to laugh, scratching his chest.
VIPER: Flex.? You don't look like Flex to me. You call that muscle? Doesn't look like muscle. Looks They laugh. Even Sundown has to laugh, scratching his chest.
VIPER: What're you laughing at? You're Stops scratching.
PORK: Don't make an issue of it, it'll
VIPER: Now to continue. In this class we will be dealing with F-5's and A4's, as our MiG simulators. Technically the F-5 does not have the thrust to weight ratio of the MiG-21it also does not bleed energy below 300 knots like the MiG-21 does. The A4 does not turn as well as the MiG-17 but has significantly better visibility.
VIPER: Hi, Charlie. Good, our TAGREF's here. Charlie's the most qualified to get into P subs and curves, and VN diagrams.
VIPER: Charlotte Blackwoodcode name Charlie not your ordinary TAGREF. Charlie has her Ph.D. in astrophysicsshe's a civilian contractor so you don't salute her.or anything else. Is that clear?
CHARLIE: Hello, I think I have some new data for you.Now a MiG 21 has a problem with the inverted flight tanks. It won't do a Negative G push over. Even below one G, they risk a flame out. Operationally, they will do a zero to one G only.
CHARLIE: The latest intelligence shows that the most they will do in operation is one..is there something wrong, I don't think you're altogether right.about the MiG, that is.
MAVERICK: I don't think you're altogether right.about the MiG, that is.
CHARLIE: I beg your pardon.
MAVERICK: No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
CHARLIE: Why not?
MAVERICK: I saw one.
CHARLIE: You saw a MiG 21?
MAVERICK: I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
CHARLIE: ( She doesn't believe him ) Where did you see that?
MAVERICK: It's classified.
CHARLIE: It's what?
MAVERICK: It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
VIPER: She stops Viper with a glance.
CHARLIE: It's all right.
CHARLIE: Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
MAVERICK: Not in this case.
CHARLIE: ( Flatly. ) You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
MAVERICK: Yes, ma'am.
CHARLIE: Where were you?
MAVERICK: On his six.
CHARLIE: He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
MAVERICK: Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
CHARLIE: If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
MAVERICK: I was inverted.
CHARLIE: You were in a 4G inverted dive with a MiG 21? ( She can't believe it. )
MAVERICK: Two miles.
CHARLIE: Two miles.
MAVERICK: Two meters.
GOOSE: One and a half, actually. I got a What were you doing there?
CHARLIE: ( Flatly. ) What were you doing there?
MAVERICK: What were you doing there?
CHARLIE: What were you doing there?
MAVERICK: Giving him the bird.
CHARLIE: The what?
MAVERICK: You know. The finger.
CHARLIE: So you're the reason those SALT talks failed.
VIPER: It's just like he says, sir.
GOOSE: It's just like he says, sir.
VIPER: ( He snaps ) I don't care!
MAVERICK: Why didn't you tell me you were a
TAGREF?: She studies him coolly for a moment, like a specimen.
CHARLIE: It never came up.
MAVERICK: You let me make a fool of myself.
CHARLIE: You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter?
MAVERICK: Would it have made a difference?
CHARLIE: What would?
MAVERICK: What would?
CHARLIE: You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
CHARLIE: Why can't you keep this straight?
VIPER: Maverick. Where'd you get that call sign?
MAVERICK: Ahhh. Runs in the family, sir.
VIPER: You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
MAVERICK: Yes sir.
VIPER: A good man. Good flyer.
MAVERICK: Yes sir. Thank you sir.
MAVERICK: I've lost him where is he?
GOOSE: On your six coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
GOOSE: Great move. Great
MAVERICK: He should've had me.
GOOSE: Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
MAVERICK: No way. I'll nail him this time. Going vertical.
GOOSE: He's blind you got him!
JESTER: NO JOY! NO JOY! WHERE ARE YOU? I'VE LOST SIGHT. He's out of energy! You got control? Unload!
GOOSE: He's out of energy! You got control? Unload!
JESTER: WE'RE BELOW THE HARD DECK. FIGHT'S He's right. We're at ten thousand.
GOOSE: He's right. We're at ten thousand.
MAVERICK: No way. I got you, sucker. You're going down.
MAVERICK: In the envelope. FOX TWO MISSILE
GOOSE: ( stunned ) Goddamn! We beat him!
JESTER: ROGER FOX TWO. GET YOUR BUTTS ABOVE THE HARD DECK. RETURN TO BASE They are brought up short for a moment, then the thrill of victory gets the best of them. Goose lets out a war whoop. The F-14 sweeps up, rolls into an Immelman..
MAVERICK: We did it!
GOOSE: Look, Ma, top of the world!
GOOSE: Ahhh.A little high on the left, don't you think?
MAVERICK: He aileron rolls another quarter turn. Inverted, they pass right down the runway. Goose looks out and insouciantly watches the world go by at 300 knots, upside down.
GOOSE: Right. Much better. .Ahhh.what do you call this?
MAVERICK: It's a victory roll.
GOOSE: I wouldn't call it victory. It's more like.self immolation.
GOOSE: Hi.Hi there. How ya doing in there? Mav. Ahhh.you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
MAVERICK: Come on, relax.
GOOSE: You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?. Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
MAVERICK: Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
GOOSE: Just once, if they take your plane They roll out, break over the runway.
ICEMAN: Maverick keeps walking.Goose hangs back.
SLIDER: Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
GOOSE: Hey, see any controls back there? And anyway.we beat the Son of a He turns and runs to catch up with Maverick.
WOLFMAN: You won?!!!
MAVERICK: Didn't everybody?
WOLFMAN: No, we.got our butts kicked.
HOLLYWOOD: Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
WOLFMAN: We went like this, he went like that. I say to Hollywood: Where'd he go? Hollywood says: where'd who And he's laughing. Right over the radio, He's laughing at us.
HOLLYWOOD: And he's laughing. Right over the radio, He's laughing at us.
GOOSE: You won. Congratulations. HOLLYWOOD Maverick and Goose won too.
ICE: That's not what I heard.
GOOSE: We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
ICE: Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
JESTER: Maverick, Goose. Viper's office. Now!
VIPER'S OFFICE: He moves over to face Maverick. There is a SILENCE like after a train wreck; nothing but the POPPING of sprung metal and the low GASP of escaping steam. Viper speaks quietly, like a funeral director consoling the living. Makes you want to scream.
VIPER: Well..That about covers the Jester almost breaks into a grin.
VIPER: Now.in addition.you broke two major rules of engagement. And. That's .not good.
VIPER: Lieutenant Candela lost sight of you, and called "no joy". You failed to respond.
VIPER: Maverick is exhausted. It's been a long, rough day. His voice is a horse whisper.
MAVERICK: I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger.
VIPER: ( to Goose ) Is that how you remember it?
GOOSE: Yes, sir. By the time we could respond, we were diving right into his view.
VIPER: The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
JESTER: Just below ten thousand.
VIPER: But you continued to fight.
VIPER: We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
MAVERICK: We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
VIPER: The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
MAVERICK: Yes sir, perfectly clear. I guess we were .I was. just a little over enthusiastic.
VIPER: I guess you were. Dismissed.
JESTER: I don't know what to tell you, Tell me one thing.
VIPER: Tell me one thing.
VIPER: .If you had to go into combat, would you want him with you?
JESTER: Viper slaps shut the fitness report.
JESTER: He's seat of the pants. Completely unpredictable nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class. ( laughs ) He throws the report on the desk.
VIPER: Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class. ( laughs ) He throws the report on the desk.
JESTER: Yup, a wild pony.
WOLFMAN: No. No. Look out, you lost it.
WOLFMAN: We're dead!
GOOSE: Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
HOLLYWOOD: ( disgusted with himself ) Come on. I died enough for one 56A. EXT. COCKPIT They climb out of the simulator - A cockpit sprung on moveable rams, surrounded by a dome on which video images are As they climb down, Maverick and Goose climb up into the cockpit to take their place.
GOOSE: Have you guys ever considered career counseling?
57. OMITTED: 56B. SIMULATOR CONTROL ROOM - Filled with computers, tape transports and video screen representations of computer generated combat. Now Maverick flies it as Charlie and other techs watch.
56C. COCKPIT: Maverick flys the heck out of it. It's real. It lurches and bumps, the NOISES and sights look real. He gets on the tail of a MiG. It breaks, he breaks, then what he does is just too fast to follow. It screams around in a turn. Suddenly, there is a WHUMMP.ALARMS.the lights come on.
GOOSE: What happened.
GOOSE: What did you do? You broke it!
CHARLIE: You flew it off the template. Nobody ever did that before.
GOOSE: That's what she said last night.
CHARLIE: What is it about you?
MAVERICK: What would you say, too fast.too And far too aggressive.
CHARLIE: And far too aggressive.
MAVERICK: It is combat. Every second counts.
CHARLIE: The hottest moves in the world aren't gonna help you if you wind up alone. Your wingman's got to be able to follow you. Trust you. Know that he can depend on you. It's more than just fancy flying.
MAVERICK: Well, what you need.what you have to keep looking for.what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something. I'm sorry.
CHARLIE: For what?
MAVERICK: That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
CHARLIE: Apology acknowledged.
MAVERICK: Is that all?
CHARLIE: What else do you want?
MAVERICK: Um. You.
CHARLIE: There you go with those moves Too aggressive?
MAVERICK: Too aggressive?
CHARLIE: I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
MAVERICK: I'm special.
CHARLIE: ( laughs ) Yes. I'll give you that!
MAVERICK: Give me a break, I'm asking you I can't.
CHARLIE: I can't.
MAVERICK: I thought there was something. That night in the club.
CHARLIE: Evan. or Maverick.
MAVERICK: Evan. or Maverick.
CHARLIE: Maverick.you know the rules of
MAVERICK: ( can't believe it. ) The what?
CHARLIE: Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
MAVERICK: What are you talking about?
CHARLIE: You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
MAVERICK: I'm not your foe.
CHARLIE: And if he's harmless, you Uh hum.
MAVERICK: Uh hum.
CHARLIE: Uh hum.
MAVERICK: What if he's not?
CHARLIE: You have to shoot him down..If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
MAVERICK: Harmless. Nobody ever called me harmless before.
CHARLIE: And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just.I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
MAVERICK: Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
CHARLIE: How about what?
MAVERICK: How about anything, anything you want to do.
CHARLIE: Hard to argue with that, isn't A date. Coffee. A drink.A walk in the park.
MAVERICK: A date. Coffee. A drink.A walk in the park.
CHARLIE: What about the plane?
MAVERICK: What plane.
CHARLIE: Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit.play with the levers and things.
MAVERICK: Well, get used to it.
CHARLIE: Used to what?
MAVERICK: I'm different.
CHARLIE: I'm starting to sense that now.
MAVERICK: You're slow to engage. But you'll come around.
MAVERICK: Let's make it at eight.
CHARLIE: Make what?
MAVERICK: Okay, anything. Just.go. I've gotta work.
CHARLIE: Okay, anything. Just.go. I've gotta work.
CHARLIE: Why'd you do that?
MAVERICK: ( surprised )
MAVERICK: It dies. We live.
CHARLIE: You're an animal.
MAVERICK: That's true. What are you?
CHARLIE: I don't enjoy watching things He smashes the fish on a rock. It is still.
CHARLIE: It's not suffering anymore.
MAVERICK: It's not suffering anymore.
CHARLIE: ( she looks at him strangely, half jokes ) You're horrible
MAVERICK: You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs? ( he puts it down ) Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
CHARLIE: You don't have to kill it.
MAVERICK: Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty You ever think about killing another human being?
CHARLIE: You ever think about killing another human being?
MAVERICK: About as much as they think about killing me.
CHARLIE: Does it bother you?
MAVERICK: They know the rules.( this is too strong for her, she turns away, he comes around to her. ) That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission. ( she draws away ) It bothers you, why? You're part of it. ( She stiffens, he's losing her. He softens ) Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for You don't want to confront it, do you. You want to keep it all clean, cerebral. velocity vectors, wing-load diagrams.You ever been You use your mind to keep things at a distance. You ever just let go?
CHARLIE: You use your mind to keep things at a distance. You ever just let go?
MAVERICK: You use your mind to keep things at a distance. You ever just let go?
MAVERICK: You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth.and my guts and my wind. And my brains.Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
CHARLIE: You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
MAVERICK: That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws.gravity.whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
CHARLIE: Winston Churchill.
MAVERICK: What he said."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
CHARLIE: What he said."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
MAVERICK: All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead. When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead. maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
CHARLIE: What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss.
MAVERICK: There is lots of stuff I don't know about. Fine wine. great art. the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
CHARLIE: Are you really that brave?
MAVERICK: ( shakes his head no. ) I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She. was very brave.braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
CHARLIE: It's just as I thought.
MAVERICK: You're totally insane.
CHARLIE: You're totally insane.
MAVERICK: ( he smiles ) Thanks very much. ( he lifts the fish ) Care for some suchi?.
GOOSE: Come on, we're next.
MAVERICK: Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
GOOSE: Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
GOOSE: Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
MAVERICK: I've had enough.for now.
MAVERICK: Come on.
CHARLIE: You want to go ballistic?
MAVERICK: You want to go ballistic?
CHARLIE: I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
MAVERICK: Stick with me, you'll get used to it.
CUT TO: 59G. EXT. RUSTIC ADOBE CANTINA - SUNSET The bike is parked in front.
MAVERICK: I always wanted to fly. ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
CHARLIE: And now?
MAVERICK: And now I want you.
CHARLIE: You always get what you want?
MAVERICK: I don't know yet.
DISSOLVE: He puts money in jukebox. She watches him.eye to eye contact. The music comes on.
CHARLIE: I want it understood.
MAVERICK: No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
CHARLIE: No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
MAVERICK: I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
CHARLIE: I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
MAVERICK: She looks at his eyes for any sign of a put-on, insincerity. Finally he smiles at her but she can read it. It's time. She moves in and covers his grin with a gentle kiss.
DISSOLVE: To them sitting within striking distance at a table. The dog sleeps beneath. Their eyes are now locked. The electricity almost arcs between them.
VIPER: The bandit has good position right here. All right, freeze here. The moment of choice Maverick is defensive. He has a chance to bug out right here..Better to retire and save your plane than force a bad position. Stay in the diamond another three seconds, the bandit will blow you out of the sky.make a hard right, select zone 5.( turns to Maverick to drive point home ) you can extend and escape. You make a bad choice. Roll The computerized rendering resumes on the screen. You perform a split S. That's the last thing you should do. The bandit is right on your tail Freeze there.the bandit has you in his gunsight. What were you thinking here, Maverick?
MAVERICK: I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
VIPER: Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
MAVERICK: ( smiling ) No guts, no glory.
SLIDER: Your guts. His glory.
VIPER: Unfortunately, the gamble worked, or you might have learned something. The bandit never gets a clean shot.Maverick makes an aggressive vertical move here, comes over the top and defeats the bandit with a missile shot. The encounter was a victory, but we've shown it as an example of what not to do. Ice is next.
HOLLYWOOD: Gutsiest move I ever saw.
VIPER: And the dumbest.Okay, look at this. It's textbook. Ice takes control of the battle immediately. He never gives the bandit a chance to take the offensive. An early turn here excellent. He goes for the jugular, and it's over just that quick. Let's run that again, it's exactly how it should be done.
GOOSE: What the hell is this?
MAVERICK: Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big Jester yells from the distance.
JESTER: On the run. Let's go. Move it!
GOOSE: A fighter pilot's lunch. a hot dog and a puke.
HOLLYWOOD: I was a victim of circumstance.
GOOSE: They should have warned you about that one.
HOLLYWOOD: She's kinky for flight suitssaid that she'd never seen so many zippersplayed with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
GOOSE: What'd you do?
HOLLYWOOD: Pulled left, rolled out, It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
WOLFMAN: It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
HOLLYWOOD: That's because you don't have any Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
WOLFMAN: Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
HOLLYWOOD: The girl with the purple That's hertall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
WOLFMAN: That's hertall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
MAVERICK: It was bad.
WOLFMAN: The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
MAVERICK: The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
HOLLYWOOD: Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his I didn't ruin her.
WOLFMAN: I didn't ruin her.
MAVERICK: You didn't help.
WOLFMAN: No, really. She came ruined!. Ya think he knows it was me?
GOOSE: Seemed not to. But it's hard to know. You never can tell what's in the mind of a psychopath.
HOLLYWOOD: Hear about Ice?
WOLFMAN: What now?
HOLLYWOOD: He won again.
GOOSE: Something bothering you?
MAVERICK: Nothing. Let's just go fight.
MAVERICK: Morning, Coogan.
WOLFMAN: How's it goin', Coog?
HOLLYWOOD: Ever find your sister, Coogan?
COOGAN: You guys know somethin' about that?
JESTER: ROGER. COMING LEFT. Holy shit, it's Viper.
HOLLYWOOD: Holy shit, it's Viper.
MAVERICK: Keep your shirt on, he's saying holy shit it's us.
MAVERICK: STAY WITH HIM, WOOD. YOUR SIX Bogey One loops and comes down, and Hollywood almost loses him for a moment before regaining the angle.
CLEAR!: Bogey One loops and comes down, and Hollywood almost loses him for a moment before regaining the angle.
MAVERICK: STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN! Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose Maverick looks quickly at three o'clock high, sees Bogey Two returning to the fight. He jerks the stick right, and the two planes make a quick pass.
GOOSE: Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose Maverick looks quickly at three o'clock high, sees Bogey Two returning to the fight. He jerks the stick right, and the two planes make a quick pass.
VIPER: SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM.. ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
MAVERICK: ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
GOOSE: Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
MAVERICK: I'm gonna take him, Goose.
GOOSE: Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
MAVERICK: I want him!
GOOSE: Hey, come onhey!
GOOSE: What what are you doing? We're cover!
MAVERICK: Wood's okay. I want Viper.
GOOSE: But we're cover!
MAVERICK: What's the range, Goose. I've got a good tone.
GOOSE: Two bogies ! Three o'clock high, nine o'clock high! Break!
JESTER: ATOLL ON THE NORTHERN F-14. HE'S OUT OF THE FIGHT.. Maverick is stunned. He has been tricked, humiliated. There's a little salt for the wound as Viper and Jester NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING. THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT REGRETS TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR SONS ARE DEAD BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID! Slaps his helmet like a dolt.
VIPER: WALKED RIGHT INTO IT. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING. THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT REGRETS TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR SONS ARE DEAD BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID! Slaps his helmet like a dolt.
JESTER: NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING. THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT REGRETS TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR SONS ARE DEAD BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID! Slaps his helmet like a dolt.
GOOSE: THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT REGRETS TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR SONS ARE DEAD BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID! Slaps his helmet like a dolt.
VIPER: KNOCK OFF THE CHATTER, TOP GUNS. LET'S RTB. VIPER HAS THE LEAD. 80. INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY Silence. Several pilots in various forms of undress. Maverick and Goose sit with their heads down, a hangdog expression on their faces.
LATER: Maverick mopes at the bar, a figure comes up behind him.
VIPER: Ya know, that was the best flying I've seen since Nam.( He grins ) .Right up to that part where you got killed.
VIPER: Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
MAVERICK: I lost.
VIPER: Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed.and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.
MAVERICK: I can take care of myself.
VIPER: Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive. ( he studies him for a moment ) Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
MAVERICK: It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that Then why are you here?
VIPER: Then why are you here?
MAVERICK: For the same reason you are.
VIPER: Oh, you mean the thrill!
MAVERICK: The flying. The fighting. I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good. Just give me the jet.
VIPER: It's not a gift, just a loan.
VIPER: Nine out of ten is okay, as long as it's only fun and games. But this isn't about that. This is serious business. It is dangerous up there! At 500 knots, things can change a lot in a second. Discipline is what protects us.
VIPER: It was a good day. You learned something. You lost and you're still alive to think about it. And, you lost your wingman. That's a cardinal sin.don't ever do it again. You owe Hollywood an apology and you owe me a beer.
GOOSE: Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate .under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
MAVERICK: I guess that's what I'm doing, Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in A pretty woman emerges from the crowd and spots them first. She rushes them, happily, carrying her sleepy four-year-old, RICKY. Goose undergoes an immediate change, beaming a big smile that he has practiced on her for years. She sets down the kid.

GOOSE: .butt.Hi, honey, God, am I glad to see you! I missed you.
CAROL: I had to come, Willard, I got so lonesome I just couldn't stand it.
GOOSE: Sure, honey, I understand. It's great to see you. Hey where's your backseater, where's the world's smallest RIO..
MAVERICK: Food.and you.my F-14!
CHARLIE: In that order?
MAVERICK: Well no.inverse order.
CHARLIE: I'm still second best.

MAVERICK: Lucky charm.
CHARLIE: What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
MAVERICK: Just good luck.
CHARLIE: Where'd you get it.
MAVERICK: Pawn shop. What's to eat?
ICE: ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK. The F-5 sees his pursuers. Goes into a hard left.
MAVERICK: The F-5 sees his pursuers. Goes into a hard left.
SHIT!!: The F-5 sees his pursuers. Goes into a hard left.
ICE: MIG'S IN A LEFT. MIG'S IN A LEFTHAND. I'M ENGAGING. Ice struggles against the G's to bring his nose to bear. They go around into a Lufberya tight circle, Ice has the advantage. He is closer to the F-5's tail than the F-5 is to his. But he can't close, can't line up the shot. He grunts and strains as the G force pushes him down.

MAVERICK: IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM. Ice stays.
ICE: NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM. Ice stays.
MAVERICK: COMING IN. Maverick dives down between the two planes pulling 6.5 G's, exposing his underside to Ice. All Ice sees is belly. Obviously, in this attitude Maverick can't see him.
ICE: ( under breath. ) He slams the stick hard right in toward Maverick. Ice quickly rolls up right, in front of him.
ICE: LOOK OUT! Maverick sees him flash into his view. He has to slam the stick forward to avoid collision. He swings by real close. Too close.

GOOSE: Oh, no!
GOOSE: Plane's coupling up! Plane's coupling up!
GOOSE: This is not good!.( Rising panic ) We're low!
MAVERICK: I'm pinned to the panel.
GOOSE: Time to go.
MAVERICK: I can't eject.
GOOSE: 3000 feet. I'll do it.
MAVERICK: Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
GOOSE: Let's go. Eject.
MAVERICK: Let's go. Eject.
85C. UNDERWATER: His face, distorted in the water; wild eyes, disoriented, choking for air. He reaches out, finds nothing to grab. Suddenly, he is yanked hard to the side.
FROGMAN: Let him go, sir. Take it easy.
FROGMAN: Sir! Let him go. It's all right. Let him go.
VIPER: How do you feel?
MAVERICK: All right.
VIPER: Goose is dead.
MAVERICK: I know. I was there.
VIPER: If you fly jets long enough, something like this happens to you. No one escapes it. It touches us Maverick looks at Viper, and his eyes are very disturbed.
MAVERICK: He was.my responsibilitymy RIO.
VIPER: My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be othersyou can count on it.
VIPER: You've got to put him in the box.
CHARLIE: .they say you're alright.
MAVERICK: I'm fine.
CHARLIE: This is it, then.
MAVERICK: The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't He was a friend of mine. A good guy.great guy. It was my That's not what I hear.

CHARLIE: That's not what I hear.
MAVERICK: I was flying.my responsibility.
CHARLIE: That's what you get flight pay for.
MAVERICK: Maybe I shouldn't take it.
CHARLIE: ( In surprise ) Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
MAVERICK: Not to me.
CHARLIE: You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important 88A. ON THE BEACH - NIGHT AND FOG Charlie's car pulls up. They get out and walk down toward the water. Maverick seems dazed. She is softly taunting.
MAVERICK: Where are we?
CHARLIE: Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes. when I feel like crawling back in.
MAVERICK: You don't have to do this.
CHARLIE: Do what, show you a good time?
MAVERICK: I'm not good company. I should be I don't think so, but if that's what you want.
CHARLIE: I don't think so, but if that's what you want.
MAVERICK: What do you want?
CHARLIE: What do you want?
MAVERICK: I want it back.
CHARLIE: She turns, nods out, past the moon.
MAVERICK: She turns, nods out, past the moon.
CHARLIE: You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line.today becomes yesterday.or tomorrow, I forget which.
MAVERICK: That's what I want.
CHARLIE: Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times.nothing really changes.
CHARLIE: On the beach. It's what they say when Navy men retire.He's "On The Beach". I always liked that. I had a picture.in my head. all these old guys wandering around here, looking out into the past.
MAVERICK: If we knew then, what we know now, we might never have come up out of He turns to her. She just looks at him.
CHARLIE: You don't believe that.
MAVERICK: Hardly ever.
CHARLIE: Only when you're depressed. Then it It does.
MAVERICK: It does.
CHARLIE: Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
CHARLIE: This too.shall pass. You put as much life as you can between it and you. You start piling up experience between then and now.
MAVERICK: What do you do when you come here?
CHARLIE: I sit. I think. I play games.
MAVERICK: What kind of games?
CHARLIE: I like to play "reality".
MAVERICK: How do you play reality.
CHARLIE: It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to Strip reality! How do you play It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing. ( he laughs again ) One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing You're crazy. ( She stops, he goes on, softer ) That's a pretty silly Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? .that we are gods. That we control events on the beach. that we can turn back She moves in close.

CHARLIE: Want to play the game?
MAVERICK: How does it go?
CHARLIE: You say the truth. ( a beat. ) Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
MAVERICK: What truth?
CHARLIE: The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
MAVERICK: Goose is dead.
CHARLIE: ( she nods ) Take something off.
MAVERICK: Take something off.
CHARLIE: Take something off.
MAVERICK: Off me or off you?
CHARLIE: That's up to you.
CHARLIE: It's dangerous.what you do.
MAVERICK: It was my fault.
CHARLIE: You can't bring him back.
MAVERICK: It was my fault.
CHARLIE: Nope. Already used that.
CHARLIE: Your life goes on.
MAVERICK: What does it mean?
CHARLIE: ( shakes her head no ) That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
CHARLIE: You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it That's three.
MAVERICK: That's three.
CHARLIE: And that's one!
MAVERICK: One more.
CHARLIE: Your watch.
MAVERICK: You owe me one.
CHARLIE: Looks like a tie.
MAVERICK: Who's gonna win?
CHARLIE: We'll say it together. On the count of three.One.two.
BOTHTOGETHER: I love.ove y.you.
FUNGUS: BOGEY AT TEN O'CLOCK LOW. YOU'VE GOT THE ANGLE PIECE OF CAKE. Maverick checks ten o'clock low. He is disturbed. He tries to make the move, but he is a man with no secret: he is ENGAGE, MAVERICK - ANYTIME. The bogey abruptly turns into him. Maverick hesitates. Then suddenly, he jerks the stick hard right and takes the F-14 away from the bogey at great speed. Fungus is startled.
FUNGUS: ENGAGE, MAVERICK - ANYTIME. The bogey abruptly turns into him. Maverick hesitates. Then suddenly, he jerks the stick hard right and takes the F-14 away from the bogey at great speed. Fungus is startled.
FUNGUS: WHAT? WHERE'RE YOUHEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING? DIDN'T . AHHH.LOOK GOOD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT? NO. NO GOOD. 96A. INT. FLIGHT LINE - DAY Jester walks up to Viper who waits near an F-5.
MAVERICK: DIDN'T . AHHH.LOOK GOOD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT? NO. NO GOOD. 96A. INT. FLIGHT LINE - DAY Jester walks up to Viper who waits near an F-5.
FUNGUS: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT? NO. NO GOOD. 96A. INT. FLIGHT LINE - DAY Jester walks up to Viper who waits near an F-5.
MAVERICK: NO. NO GOOD. 96A. INT. FLIGHT LINE - DAY Jester walks up to Viper who waits near an F-5.
JESTER: He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
VIPER: It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
JESTER: I've seen this before.
VIPER: So have I.
JESTER: Some guys never get it back.
FUNGUS: What are you doing?
MAVERICK: Saving them some paperwork.
FUNGUS: Since when did you care about Maverick walks away. Fungus hesitates, then follows him.
FUNGUS: If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
MAVERICK: Not anymore.
FUNGUS: So, you're scaredso what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
CHARLIE: Never liked fighter pilots anyway.
MAVERICK: You came to the right place.
CHARLIE: I'll have what he's having. Hemlock, is it?
CHARLIE: You weren't gonna say goodbye?
MAVERICK: I was, later.
CHARLIE: Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
MAVERICK: I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did.but I didn't..
CHARLIE: I know exactly what you mean.
MAVERICK: How could you?
CHARLIE: I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
MAVERICK: ( laughs ) .Something like that.
CHARLIE: And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career.hotel management or something.
MAVERICK: Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
CHARLIE: Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot.I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes.I just get happy being with the right I hope you find him.
MAVERICK: I hope you find him.
CHARLIE: I think I have. I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot. You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
CHARLIE: So long, Sailor. See you on the beach sometime.
TIM: Dad.Of all the aminals in the ocean, which one's the baddest?
VIPER: I don't know, Tim. You'll have to ask them.
VIPER: Runs in the family.
MAVERICK: Skipper, sorry to bother you.
VIPER: No bother.
MAVERICK: I called your house.
VIPER: My wife's house.
MAVERICK: She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option.( Maverick thinks for a beat. Segues to the question. ) What about me?
VIPER: We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
MAVERICK: Or you can quit.
VIPER: Or you can quit.
MAVERICK: I don't know.
VIPER: I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
MAVERICK: You've already made up your mind.
VIPER: It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday.
MAVERICK: ( starts to get his back up ) You think I should quit?!
VIPER: I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right.that they can depend on The vendor hands them icecream, they take it.
MAVERICK: Here, let me get this. We'll be He reaches into his pocket for change, comes out with a handful. Slams it on the counter, stars picking the proper change out. Viper spots something and reaches for it.Maverick sees and tries to block it, but Viper comes up with the Navy Cross.
MAVERICK: Lucky charm.
VIPER: Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it. I served with your old man.
MAVERICK: I know.
VIPER: VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better.and worse.
MAVERICK: I'm nothing like him.
VIPER: You may not think so, but you are.
MAVERICK: He was by the book, all the way.
VIPER: They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the I never heard that.
MAVERICK: I never heard that.
VIPER: Not something they tell dependents.
MAVERICK: It's not true.
VIPER: Why would I lie?
VIPER: You start on a wrong heading. the more you stick to it, the further you get from your target. A good pilot always questions himself, always questions his judgments, stays alert for drift and makes the corrections.You may find a little discipline helps with the fear. You don't have to be alone up there.
MAVERICK: How can I go on? I feel so. Kid, the plain fact is.you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic. I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status.so you don't kill yourself or anybody else.that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to You think I shouldn't fly.

MAVERICK: You think I shouldn't fly.
VIPER: I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot. a better man.
MAVERICK: Would you take me back? Would they?
VIPER: I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
FUNGUS: I don't know where he is.
PORK: What are his plans?
FUNGUS: I don't know.
FUNGUS: I'm glad.
WOLFMAN: Good to see you, man.
VIPER: Gentlemen, you know how I hate to break up this party before it has a chance to get really out of hand. .but there's a major flap on.
HOLLYWOOD: We're being called back?
VIPER: You're on your way. Don't bother going to BOQ. Your bags are packed.
EYES: WIDEN OUT - To include his helmet. Stereo headphones from his walkman carry the same music from the party as he sits in the cockpit and stares at the grey water rushing under. He sits in his Tomcat on Ready 5 Alert. In the back, Fungus plays a hand computer game - Jet Attack.

FUNGUS: Bandit at seven o'clock lowsolo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
MAVERICK: Okay, okay.
FUNGUS: Don't tell me okay. Do it!
MAVERICK: MAVERICK'S EMGAGED. HARD LEFT, ICE, PADLOCK THE EASTERN SECTION. The F-14's execute a left oblique turn in unison. They come down in a section attack with their cannons blazing. From Maverick's cockpit, everything looks choppy: MiGs slide past at incredible speed. Cannons BLAST, as the planes scramble for position.
FUNGUS: BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT! CHAFF! BREAKING LEFT! Maverick releases a flare as he takes the F-14 into a hard left. The missile tracks the heat of the flare and sails out of the area, missing the Tomcat and falling toward the sea.
FLARES!: BREAKING LEFT! Maverick releases a flare as he takes the F-14 into a hard left. The missile tracks the heat of the flare and sails out of the area, missing the Tomcat and falling toward the sea.

ICE: TWO MIGS ON MY TAIL, MAVERICK. I'M Maverick jerks his stick right and streaks toward Ice. He cuts off one of the MiGs with CANNON FIRE, driving it down toward the deck. Ice goes into vertical and comes around to gain an angle on the other MiG. His RIO is in position to check Mav's rear.
SLIDER: MAVERICK! SIX O'CLOCK! Maverick turns to look and jerks a hard left. The MiG is on him, CANNON BLAZING. Ice Yo Yos inside and cuts the MiG off.
ICE: FOX ONE. He fires a sidewinder. The MiG turns hard, the missile sails BANDIT, THREE O'OLOCK HIGH! Ice's F-14 is suddenly caught in a HAIL OF CANNON FIRE as a MiG sweeps down from three o'clock. He breaks, dives. The jets streak across the sky, low to the deck, skimming the ICE'S DEFENSIVE, HELP HIM OUT. Maverick's F-14 Rollaways in and intercepts the bogey on Ice's tail.

MAVERICK: REVERSE RIGHT. Ice turns right, the MiG bugs and jerks into vertical. Maverick swoops after him.
FUNGUS: STAY WITH HIM. YOUR SIX IS CLEAR. Maverick closes, jerking left, right, twisting and turning, staying on his tail.
FUNGUS: ONE ON OUR SIX! BUG OUT! BUG OUT! BULLETS fly by Maverick's F-14 from the MiG on his six. He pulls a hard left, then takes the plane straight up. We hear instructions shouted by Fungus, but it is all obscured in the SOUNDS AND FURY OF THE BATTLE. Maverick peels over the top and comes down like a comet. A series of passes at the MiGs. As they come by, one of the MiGs pulls up,
MAVERICK: OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH. LOOK OUT! They look up. An MiG 21 is coming down, belly to them, close to a mid-air collision.
ICE: LOOK OUT! They look up. An MiG 21 is coming down, belly to them, close to a mid-air collision.
LOOK OUT!: They look up. An MiG 21 is coming down, belly to them, close to a mid-air collision.
MAVERICK: He pushes down. The MiG ROARS BY. The whole airplane goes "BOOOMMMM" it's that close.
JESUS!: He pushes down. The MiG ROARS BY. The whole airplane goes "BOOOMMMM" it's that close.
FUNGUS: OHHHHH SHIT! The shock, the air pressure SLAMS them as it goes by, missing by 4-5 feet. Maverick pulls back in, sees a MiG 21 below. It takes off, bugging out. Ice goes after him. The MiG maneuvers, jerking hard left, hard right, twisting up, down.

ICE: GOOD TONE, FOX ONE The MiG starts turning.
ICE: Ah Nuts!
ICE: Son of a bitch!
SLIDER: JESUS! HEY SPLASH ONE, SPLASH ONE BANDIT! SPLASH THAT SUCKER! I GOT ONE HERE. ON THE NOSE. COMING DOWN. Rolling down on him, good SIDEWINDER TONE. The MiG'S sense him, they break, one guy down low.
MAVERICK: I GOT ONE HERE. ON THE NOSE. COMING DOWN. Rolling down on him, good SIDEWINDER TONE. The MiG'S sense him, they break, one guy down low.
ICE: ON THE NOSE? GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE. He squeezes the trigger.
MAVERICK: GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE. He squeezes the trigger.
MAVERICK: AH, SHIT! GODDAMN IT! MiG comes back turning into him.
FUNGUS: THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE! I GOT ONE COMING UP. AND HE'S GUNNING. He looks back. 30 millimeter tracers go by; they just kind of float. He breaks, hits airbrakes, the trailing MiG dives Suddenly another MiG appears, rocketing straight for him. They close at 900 knotsVABOOOM!They pass nose to nose, canopy to canopy. Both planes pitch straight up, trying for the altitude advantage.

MAVERICK: Zone 5 burners.
FUNGUS: We're ballistic! Ohhhhhh Shit!
FUNGUS: Ohhh Mother!
MAVERICK: ( strangely calm ) Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
FUNGUS: Don't WORRY!!!? You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
MAVERICK: Roger, I've got it.
FUNGUS: You've got it? Good! Cause for a minute there, you had me worried.
FUNGUS: Now have you got it? Have you still got it?
MAVERICK: Yawing right.
FUNGUS: I know!
MAVERICK: Rudder's left, stick's forward.

MAVERICK: The earth grows larger.
FUNGUS: 4500. Critical point.
MAVERICK: No! Not again!
FUNGUS: What are you talking about,
MAVERICK: I'm not losing it again!
FUNGUS: Gotta go, man.
MAVERICK: 280, 290, 300 knots.
FUNGUS: 3,000 feet. We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
MAVERICK: You go. I'm staying with it.
FUNGUS: I'm gonna go! THREE.TWO.ONE.
FUNGUS: SEA LEVEL Maverick stops the tumble, pulls the nose up quickly and the F-l4 sweeps into level flight no more than a hundred feet above the deck. He comes up and looks right at Ice. Ice is down low. He comes around, a MiG-21 all over him like a cheap suit. A flick, a whip, and Maverick in perfect position, rolls right in on the MiG. Fungus looks like he just saw What in the Christ.was that?

FUNGUS: What in the Christ.was that?
FUNGUS: Did you plan that? Was all that something you planned?
MAVERICK: ALL RIGHT, ICE. COME HARD STARBOARD, THEN EXTEND TO THE EAST. Fungus is still lividly frazzled.
FUNGUS: Because.if that was. Next time you tell me first.
ICE: Maverick breaks down, Ice zooms up, breaks in and takes the MiG the other way. Maverick Yo Yo's in, comes right up behind the MiG, as the MiG starts acceleration.
MAVERICK: I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT. I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT? I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU. WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE? SHOOT IT. WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2 The MiG fires.

MAVERICK: WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2 The MiG fires.
MAVERICK: HE FIRED, BREAK NOW! Ice breaks left, drops flares. The MiG's missile follows the flares. Maverick FIRES. The missile doesn't twitch. It flys right up the tail pipe of the MiG, the canopy flies off, the pilot comes out of it, and then the MiG blows up, We go right through the fire ball. VVVARRRUOOMMM!
MAVERICK: He's out! We got him!
FUNGUS: What a dope! Maybe they'll
FUNGUS: What is it? What's wrong?
FUNGUS: Is there something I should know?
MAVERICK: Just relax.

OFFICER: Who is that guy?
ADMIRAL: ( surpressing a grin ) .Likes to break at 600, 'stead of 300 knots. The Air Boss hates him. One time, he came over the deck at two hundred, shakes the shit out of the bridge. Lifted Johnson right off his feet.
