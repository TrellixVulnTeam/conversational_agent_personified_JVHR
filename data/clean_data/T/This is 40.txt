DEBBIE: Oh Pete! Oh my god! This is crazy!
PETE: Oh my god. So incredible. Want to know a secret? I took a Viagra.
DEBBIE: I took a Viagra. Those things totally work. This is awesome. Why don't I use this every day?
PETE: I took a Viagra. Those things totally work. This is awesome. Why don't I use this every day?
DEBBIE: What? What did you do? Wait. Stop.
PETE: What's the matter?
DEBBIE: You just took a Viagra to have sex with me?
PETE: I thought it would make it better. It was better. It takes some of the pressure off.
DEBBIE: Because you can't get hard without a Viagra? Is it because you don't think I'm sexy?
PETE: I thought you'd think it was fun for me to supersize it for once.
DEBBIE: That is the worst birthday present you could ever give someone.
PETE: I was just trying to go turbo for your birthday.
DEBBIE: I don't want a turbo penis. I like your medium soft one.
PETE: Look, I can get it up. Just not that far up.
DEBBIE: Where did you get this?
PETE: I got it from Barry.
DEBBIE: What? You got it from Barry?
PETE: Why do you care? This is my dick we're talking about, not yours.
DEBBIE: We are young people. We don't need medication to have sex.
PETE: I only took it because it's your birthday. I thought you'd like it. Happy fucking fortieth birthday.
DEBBIE: I am not forty! And I don't want to have a husband who has to take Viagra to get a hard-on.
PETE: I don't have to take it every time, but once in a while.
DEBBIE: Fuck forty! Forty can suck my dick.
SADIE: Your breath smells weird.
PETE: Wake up, wake up. Time to get up.
PETE: Make a wish!
CHARLOTTE: Can I watch Lost?
SADIE: You can't handle Lost. It's too violent, and you won't understand.
CHARLOTTE: If I don't understand it, why can't I handle it?
SADIE: Because you're eight.
CHARLOTTE: I can handle it. I've seen a shark eat a guy on Shark Week.
SADIE: Shark Week is fake.
CHARLOTTE: No, it's not.
SADIE: All of it is reenactments.
CHARLOTTE: I know but they
SADIE: That's scary! You shouldn't be allowed to watch that.

DEBBIE: No. I don't think it's weird at all. Because you're turning forty and I'm turning thirty-eight.
PETE: Come on. Do you really want to be one of those ladies who's just so insecure about their age and they lie and then they've got to You don't get it. You don't understand how it works. I don't want to shop at old lady stores. I don't want to go to J. Jill and Chicos and Ann Taylor Loft. I'm not ready yet. I need two more years.

BARB: You guys just go on without me. I'm just gonna. fuck.
BARRY: Hey, thanks for letting me join this team.
PETE: It's not really a team, it's just a bunch of guys who get together and I know, I know.
BARRY: I know, I know.
PETE: Bike lane, asshole! It's always the guy in the fucking Infiniti.
JASON: So why on earth is Pete taking Viagra? What's going on?
DEBBIE: I don't know. I think maybe he just isn't attracted to me anymore.
JASON: That is ridiculous. If you were my girlfriend, I would not need a Viagra. I would need an anti-Viagra pill. To try not to get a boner.
DEBBIE: But everyone gives you a boner.
JASON: Don't sell yourself short like that. You give me a boner. Barb doesn't give me a boner.
DEBBIE: Maybe things are just getting stale. That's why maybe I work out really hard. Maybe he'll be able to get a boner again.
BARB: Why do you need to have sex, Deb? Sex is the number one thing people fight about.
JASON: having sex. I can see it on your face. It's all puckered and pained.
BARB: that's all I'm saying.
JASON: don't have any feeling down there anymore. I have nerve damage from my C-section so everything is just hydrant, and I wouldn't even know that I was sitting. I could get stung by a hornet down there, and I would not feel it. You could put anything in there, and I would not know what the object was. I used to pee in a nice stream, and now it just kind of goes like a shower you want a family?

JASON: He doesn't seem happy.
DEBBIE: He doesn't seem happy.
JASON: He doesn't seem happy.
DEBBIE: He doesn't seem happy.
JASON: Yeah, he is.
DEBBIE: No. He's lonely.
JASON: No, he's not.
DEBBIE: See, I think he has sad eyes.
JASON: Aw, you sweet little thing. He's doing sad, lonely eyes. To get the next lady. I can do it too, watch.
DEBBIE: I bet George Clooney is really lonely. Just him and his pig.
JASON: You'd fuck him.
DEBBIE: I wouldn't.
JASON: So would you.
BARB: I would. I wouldn't feel it but-
JASON: You'd fuck him with your numb vagina. Yes, you would. Ocean's thirteen inches, that's what you'd find out.
DEBBIE: Do you think?
BARRY: I mean that was idiotic. You have to understand. That's like the one thing you don't do is tell her you used Viagra. I think that's even on the warning label.
PETE: We're in one of those phases where everything the other person says just annoys the shit out of each other. All the time. It's a blast.
BARRY: Don't worry about it. You just gotta ride that out.
PETE: This sounds terrible but do you ever wonder what it would be like if, say, you were separated by something bigger, like death. Like her death?
BARRY: I have given it a fair amount of Not in a painful way. Just quietly slid into death. Like a gas leak.
PETE: Not in a painful way. Just quietly slid into death. Like a gas leak.
BARRY: Absolutely. It has got to be peaceful. I mean this is the mother of your children.
PETE: I'd want it to be a peaceful just like, drift, into a coma, from which she never awakens.
BARRY: Then you move on. Then you're a That's just it. People love They love widowers. It's like the polar opposite of divorced guys.
PETE: That's just it. People love They love widowers. It's like the polar opposite of divorced guys.
BARRY: They love widowers. It's like the polar opposite of divorced guys.
PETE: It's the best.
BARRY: It's like, oh, that poor widower. You know. If I could only
PETE: .make him happy.
BARRY: .make him happy.
PETE: Somehow ease his pain.
BARRY: .cocksuck away his sadness.

PETE: Your mother wanted you aborted.
LARRY: Your mother wanted you aborted.
PETE: Oh, Jesus Christ.
LARRY: It's the truth. It was the seventies. We were twenty-two years old. That's what everybody did. You did some blow, had sex, had an Yes. We were on the way to the doctor's office.

PETE: Sadie's thirteen. She might be a lost cause.
DEBBIE: Where did she learn that kind of language? We don't talk like that.
PETE: I have no fucking idea. Do you think Sadie is this crazy because of us? Or is it hormones and Lost.
DEBBIE: J.J. Abrams. He's ruining our daughter. That fucking geek.
PETE: I feel bad for us.
DEBBIE: All of a sudden we're like a magnet for negativity. Why do people keep attacking us? What did we do? We're just doing our best.
PETE: Should we talk about our fight?
DEBBIE: I think we're under enough pressure. Let's just let it go this We can give each other a break.

SADIE: That's because Mad Men sucks.
PETE: What Don Draper has gone through beats whatever Jack is running from on some island.
SADIE: A bunch of people smoking in an office, it's stupid.
PETE: You're getting me off topic. Please get dressed.
DEBBIE: I am so glad you're here. I need a buffer in case it gets weird.
BARB: Well, I'm ready to buff.
DEBBIE: Here, grab these napkins.
BARRY: So that's the girl who works for Yeah, that's her.
PETE: Yeah, that's her.
BARRY: Seems nice. My wife would never let me have a hot employee like that.
BARB: You're comfortable with that around your husband?
DEBBIE: Pete wouldn't know what to do with
BARRY: You think our wives are looking at us right now?
PETE: Oh, definitely.
DEBBIE: They look like pedophiles.
JASON: Peter, hi.
PETE: Hey, how's it going?
JASON: Great, you look well. How do you like what I've been doing to your girl? How do you like Debbie's after body?
RONNIE: It's nice.
JASON: Come on, show `em. Look at this. It's beautiful. Look at that after- ass. Now it starts here, but it used to start here. And I brought it up. You're welcome.
RONNIE: Are you a trainer?
JASON: Yes, well, but not just physical. Spiritual. I'm sort of a guide.
PETE: You guys should talk. I think you'll get along. Come here, honey, I have to tell you something.
JASON: Who's that in the pool?
RONNIE: INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY Debbie and Pete open the front door. Standing there is Oliver. He gives a nervous smile. Debbie looks at him and tries to be nice, but we feel her She opens the door wider. They do not hug.

LARRY: Oliver. "Can I have some more? Please, Oliver, I need a little morsel." I love that movie. You must get that all the time.
OLIVER: Not really.
CLAIRE: I'm Claire, Larry's wife. Very good to see you, but excuse me, I'm going to go get the kids.
LARRY: We won't see her now for the whole day. I'd help honey, but I've got the blood pressure, and I don't want to.
PETE: Dad, you want a drink?
LARRY: Yeah, a little white wine.
PETE: White wine? Okay, heavy stuff.
LARRY: So, who knew that Debbie had a dad! Where have you been for fifteen years? Never seen you at Hanukkah, Christmas, Ramadan, nothing. How do you get out of all that stuff? Do you have a wife?
OLIVER: My wife is at home.
DEBBIE: Why didn't she come?
OLIVER: Construction. They're sanding our You let the woman sand the deck?
LARRY: You let the woman sand the deck?
OLIVER: She supervises it, yes.
DEBBIE: Hey guys.
LARRY: Look how big the kids are. Sadie!
DESI: Hi, Larry.
LARRY: ( to Sadie ) Hi, Sadie.
SADIE: Mom. Who is Oliver?
DEBBIE: What do you mean?
CHARLOTTE: Is he your dad?
DEBBIE: He is my biological father.
CHARLOTTE: What does that mean?
DEBBIE: He and my mom had a baby and that was me.
SADIE: Oh, so you're our grandpa.
OLIVER: Why don't you ask your mother?
DEBBIE: Yes, well, that would make him your grandpa. Do you want him to be?
CHARLOTTE: Yes. Then we get another grandpa. Come on! That was deeply uncomfortable. Thank god the pretty girl was here to divert our attention.

DESI: Did you guys come together? Are you a couple?
DESI: Sorry, the mustache is a little
JASON: That's fair.
DESI: I just assumed.
RONNIE: This is a straight man mustache.
DESI: What is the different between a gay man's mustache and a straight man's The smell.
JASON: The smell.
DESI: Excuse me.

DESI: So what's your sun sign?
RONNIE: Oh, boy.
JASON: Oh, boy.
DESI: That's not good.
JASON: No, sir.
DESI: Not for me, that's not good. Sexually we are completely That's not true.
RONNIE: That's not true.
JASON: That's such a shame. That's as bad as it gets.
DESI: What's yours?
JASON: I'm a Cancer.
DESI: Is that good?
JASON: Is that good?
RONNIE: What does it mean?
DESI: That's really strange. Well, Taurus and Cancers are sort of soul mates of the Zodiac. We're like perfectly compatible. I balance what you lack, and you make up for what I lack. And a quiet Cancer almost always has a huge penis.
JASON: ( quietly ) You're making me embarrassed.
DEBBIE: I wanted to make a toast. Thank you guys so much for coming. Pete's turning forty.
PETE: And we're ready to start this new phase of our lives with open hearts. Ready to just choose joy and forgive everybody, so thank you all for coming.
DEBBIE: And we're ready to start this new phase of our lives with open hearts. Ready to just choose joy and forgive everybody, so thank you all for coming.
LARRY: Wait. Forgive who?
PETE: I think she just meant generally. You know? Put the past behind us.
DEBBIE: And live without resentments.
LARRY: But specifically who are you forgiving? I like to know the details before I toast.
DEBBIE: Well, you and my dad and others.
LARRY: I see. I know you have some issues with me, but I'm curious, what's he in for? Before today nobody even knew he existed.
DEBBIE: My parents divorced when I was really young and we don't spend that much time together and I'd like to work on that. Just like we'd like to work on how you have financial issues.
BARRY: ( to Larry ) She means all the lending. And the I know what she meant.
LARRY: I know what she meant.
JASON: You are a beautiful woman, but you are not totally maxed out. I would say honestly, you're a six. Six and a half. I could make you an eleven.
DESI: When I found Deb, she was a seven. And now she's a twelve.
JASON: When I found Deb, she was a seven. And now she's a twelve.
DESI: I want to be a twelve.
JASON: You can't be lazy.
DESI: I don't want to be lazy.
JASON: Look at me. You cannot be lazy.
DESI: I won't be lazy.
JASON: Do you know how she got her body? Bodies By Jason.
DESI: Say it.
JASON: Say it.
DESI: Bodies By Jason.
JASON: Say it again.
DESI: Bodies By Jason.
JASON: And now just say Jason.
DESI: ( whispers ) That sounds right, doesn't it?
JASON: ( whispers ) That sounds right, doesn't it?
DESI: ( whispers ) That sounds right, doesn't it?
JASON: That sounds right, doesn't it?
DESI: What the fuck is happening right When was the last time you two saw each other, if you don't mind me Actually, we had lunch together last week.
RONNIE: What the fuck is happening right When was the last time you two saw each other, if you don't mind me Actually, we had lunch together last week.
LARRY: When was the last time you two saw each other, if you don't mind me Actually, we had lunch together last week.
OLIVER: Actually, we had lunch together last week.
LARRY: That's like two Olympics. And I'm the bad guy. What Debbie doesn't understand is that it's not bad to help out a parent. And it's certainly not bad for a parent to help out a child. I'm sure Oliver would agree.
OLIVER: That's like two Olympics. And I'm the bad guy. What Debbie doesn't understand is that it's not bad to help out a parent. And it's certainly not bad for a parent to help out a child. I'm sure Oliver would agree.

DEBBIE: dad for money?
LARRY: dad for money?
DEBBIE: dad for money?
LARRY: day. It's perfect. It helps everybody, and it relieves his guilt from all the abandonment handouts. We'd pay him back.
DEBBIE: handouts. We'd pay him back.
PETE: handouts. We'd pay him back.
OLIVER: more than happy to help.
DEBBIE: from family members because it causes resentment, remember?
PETE: that my life is shit? Is that what you want me to say? You happy? Aren't I allowed a little joy with these children I never wanted to us for money.
LARRY: that my life is shit? Is that what you want me to say? You happy? Aren't I allowed a little joy with these children I never wanted to us for money.
DEBBIE: us for money.
LARRY: Look, I don't expect you to fully understand. Your dad left. You're broken inside. It's not your fault you can't feel love. There's something that you can't this is coming out wrong.
PETE: Look, I don't expect you to fully understand. Your dad left. You're broken inside. It's not your fault you can't feel love. There's something that you can't this is coming out wrong.
DEBBIE: my dad than your dad, because he doesn't drive me crazy. You know the best quality my father has? He asks for nothing. I don't know what the fuck he's thinking right now. Look at that. Nothing. I don't even know him. And I turned out perfectly fine without his input.
LARRY: problem is. You hate Jews. Which is so odd because your children are the whole point of a Jew card.
DEBBIE: the whole point of a Jew card.
LARRY: the whole point of a Jew card.
DEBBIE: the whole point of a Jew card.
LARRY: the whole point of a Jew card.
BARRY: That's right. You can't use it up, it goes forever.
OLIVER: You know what? I have to go.
PETE: Great. What a big surprise. Bye Oliver. See you later. See you in another seven years. Make sure to say goodbye to the grandkids, who you met today. You know, nothing I do is right because of you? Nothing. No matter how hard I try, I'm just the asshole here, but you know what I realized? It's you. You're the asshole.
OLIVER: Good luck working that out. Happy birthday and go fuck yourself.
LARRY: See you when the Cubs win the I'm going to light the candles. Get it going.
BARB: I'm going to light the candles. Get it going.
LARRY: Maybe we should try the toast Can you be quiet? You just threw me under the bus.
DEBBIE: Can you be quiet? You just threw me under the bus.
PETE: No. We agreed to let go and forgive, but then you started ripping into my dad like a crazy I'm not ripping into your dad. I'm just saying to him what you say to Don't be such a ball buster.
DEBBIE: I'm not ripping into your dad. I'm just saying to him what you say to Don't be such a ball buster.
PETE: Don't be such a ball buster.
DEBBIE: I am not a ball buster. You make me one! I am a fun girl! I am fun- loving! I am a good time Sally! I dance hip-hop. I cannot believe I've wasted my whole life busting the balls of people who have no balls. I am the only one here who has any balls.
SADIE: Debbie turns, caught.
DEBBIE: You're smoking? In the front yard?
SADIE: You're smoking? In the front yard?
DEBBIE: No, they're Barb's.
SADIE: Mom! Since when have you been a I'm not a smoker.
DEBBIE: I'm not a smoker.
SADIE: I thought you said smokers die.
DEBBIE: I wasn't smoking.
SADIE: I saw you.
CHARLOTTE: Mom, you're smoking?
BARB: Deb, you can't smoke, you're pregnant. You've been doing so You're pregnant?
CHARLOTTE: You're pregnant?
SADIE: No f-ing way. I don't want another I don't want her as a sister.
CHARLOTTE: I don't want her as a sister.
BARB: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It just slipped out.
PETE: ( mouth full of cupcake ) Are you really pregnant? Since when are you pregnant?
DEBBIE: Since when do you care? You don't want another baby.
PETE: did you find out?
CHARLOTTE: did you find out?

CLAIRE: That is so wonderful. We're so happy for you.
SADIE: ( to Charlotte ) This is too adult for you. Let's go
DEBBIE: Well, I guess we're stuck together forever, then, right?
PETE: Weren't we always?
DEBBIE: You don't even want a baby.
PETE: Of course I do. I never said that. Look, I didn't want one if I could I should put that on a Hallmark card. That's beautiful.
DEBBIE: I should put that on a Hallmark card. That's beautiful.
OLIVER: Good luck with the pregnancy, Debbie. But please, take care of yourself. It's a much riskier pregnancy after forty.
DEBBIE: I'm not forty.
OLIVER: Of course you are. You were born on December 5th, 1972.
DEBBIE: How do you know?
OLIVER: I was there. I'm the one who took your mother to the hospital.
DEBBIE: That's not what she said.
OLIVER: Your mom was in labor for only twenty minutes. It was like you couldn't wait to meet me, can you imagine that?
DEBBIE: I don't even know you. You can't just come into my house and Look, maybe we were just not meant to be in each other's lives. I'm not sure this was such a great
OLIVER: ( walking out ) Look, maybe we were just not meant to be in each other's lives. I'm not sure this was such a great
DEBBIE: Hey, wait a minute. You did leave. And you didn't come back.
OLIVER: ( getting agitated ) My first life was ruined. I did my best with my second.
DEBBIE: So I ruined your life? I was eight.
OLIVER: People do better when I stay out of their lives. That's what my son tells me. You think my life is so perfect? I've got a thirteen-year- old who's a pot head, I've got a wife who's keeping Zoloft alive.
DEBBIE: You never said that before.
OLIVER: You don't think I want to talk to you about this? To share it with you? It's just not our way! We don't talk to each other, we don't know each other. I thought that's the way you wanted it. How do I get out of this? How do I get you all to just help me down off the cross?
DEBBIE: You sound just like Sadie.
OLIVER: Who's Sadie? No. Your daughter, your younger?
DEBBIE: The big one.
OLIVER: Your older. I know that! She's a wonderful girl.
LARRY: Hi, guys. Some of us need to leave. Would this be a good moment to sneak out?
SADIE: Where's Dad going?
PETE: Best birthday ever!
TEENAGER: Bike lane, asshole!
PETE: Fuck you, you Twilight pimply-ass
BARB: Your dad's still here.
DEBBIE: I know. It's weird. Where the hell is Pete?
SADIE: Mom, is it okay if Joseph hangs out here for a while?
DEBBIE: Sure. Hi, Joseph.
JOSEPH: Do you want a piece of cake?
DEBBIE: Do you want a piece of cake?
JOSEPH: Oh, yeah sure. Thank you.
BARB: They are so cute.
DEBBIE: So cute.
BARB: He looks exactly like Tom Petty.
PETE: Go around! Watch it!
DESI: Hey, Pete. Great party!
PETE: Yeah. The best!
SADIE: Then you shake it. And then a restaurant comes up.
DEBBIE: Dad? Excuse me. I'm going to go look for Pete. Would you mind staying with the girls for just a little bit?
OLIVER: ( shocked ) Well, if you want me to.
DEBBIE: If you don't mind. You don't have Can I let Sadie show me the last episode of Lost? She asked me if I'd seen it, I haven't.
OLIVER: ( beat ) Can I let Sadie show me the last episode of Lost? She asked me if I'd seen it, I haven't.
DEBBIE: That would be nice. Thank you.
OLIVER: Thank you.
SADIE: I'm going to let you watch Lost. Come on.
CHARLOTTE: Is it scary?
SADIE: I'll cover your eyes if it gets too
LARRY: Are you mad at me? Did I say Shh. Larry, please.
DEBBIE: Shh. Larry, please.
PETE: You opened your door on me.
PETE: I was right there! You are supposed to look before you open your door. I was in the fucking bike path.
PETE: Pay attention!
PETE: You're supposed to look to see if a biker is coming through. You're supposed to look!
PETE: No one is ever looking out for me!
PETE: MAN IN RANGE ROVER
PETE: Why don't you pay for my bike and my face, you fucking prick!
LARRY: Are you sure that's him? I don't think that's him.
PETE: ( in pain ) I'm going to write down your license plate number.
DEBBIE: What are you doing?
PETE: INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT Debbie and Larry sit in the waiting area of the hospital.
LARRY: I guess the party didn't turn out like you planned.
DEBBIE: It wasn't a good party.
NURSE: Hi. I'll bring you in as soon as his x-rays are finished.
DEBBIE: Is he okay?
NURSE: Yeah, he has a broken rib and he's been crying a little bit, but he'll be fine.
LARRY: You know Pete was never a real fighter. But that's why he married you. That's why he loves you. Because you're the fighter, and you need that. One person in a relationship has got to punch.
DEBBIE: Do you mean that in a good way?
LARRY: Oh, it's a high compliment.
DEBBIE: Listen, I know what you're worried about. You think he's going to turn into me, but I don't think it's going to happen. He's smarter and probably a little cuter. A little less Jewy. Although, after fifty, that's all going to change. Be prepared to wake up one day with a a rabbi. But the good news is, he'll love you forever. That's in our DNA. We stick around.

DEBBIE: He worries about you. It puts a lot of pressure on him.
LARRY: I know. I just don't have anyone else to talk to about it.
DEBBIE: You can talk to Claire.
LARRY: No. If I open up to her she'll leave me.
DEBBIE: No, she won't, Larry, she loves I know, but there's a certain point at which you just can't stay. I guess it's hard to forgive somebody if they don't formally apologize to you.
LARRY: I know, but there's a certain point at which you just can't stay. I guess it's hard to forgive somebody if they don't formally apologize to you.
DEBBIE: Are you apologizing?
LARRY: I'm very close. Yes, I'm sorry. And I'm glad everybody's okay.
DEBBIE: She hugs him and starts to cry a little bit.
LARRY: I'm off.
DEBBIE: This is awkward.
LARRY: This is awkward.
DEBBIE: I need forty dollars for a cab.
LARRY: I need forty dollars for a cab.
DEBBIE: ( laughing ) That's funny.
LARRY: No, I'm not kidding. You drove me. I wasn't prepared.
DEBBIE: I only have a hundred.
LARRY: That's okay. I'll bring you the

OLIVER: Great. I'm going to have some freaky ass nightmares.
CHARLOTTE: Great. I'm going to have some freaky ass nightmares.
DEBBIE: I really liked our lives so much better before we tried to change everything. I'm sorry.
