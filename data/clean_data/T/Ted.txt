GREENBAUM: Uh oh.
KID #1: It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow! You know what I'm gonna get him?
GREENBAUM: ( CONTINUED ) KID #1
KID #1: My fist in your fuckin' face!
GREENBAUM: Why would Jesus want that?
KID #2: Get him! The kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle him. Another boy, JOHN BENNETT ( about 8 years old, shy and innocent-looking ) approaches the melee.
JOHN: Hey guys, can I play? The kids all look at him.
GREENBAUM: Yeah, Bennett, get outta here! The kids go back to beating up Greenbaum, as John sadly walks back toward his house.
JOHN: HIS MOM AND DAD hug him.
JOHN'S DAD: I guess Santa paid attention to how good you were this year, huh?
JOHN'S MOM: ( KISSING HIM )
JOHN: He talks! John giggles happily, squeezing the bear to make it talk, as his mom and dad exchange a smile.
JOHN: Hey Teddy. can I tell you something nobody knows? Teddy looks back at him, expressionless.
JOHN: ( beat, a bit more concerned ) John looks under the covers, but the bear is not there. He jumps out of bed and looks around the bed's perimeter, assuming that Teddy must have fallen off during the night. Finally, he checks underneath the bed. ANGLE FROM UNDERNEATH THE BED we see John looking around.
TEDDY: Hug me. John yelps and stumbles back, falling over. He stares at Teddy, breathing heavily.
JOHN: Did you. did you just talk?
TEDDY: You're my best friend, John.
JOHN: ( BEAT )
TEDDY: Don't look so surprised. You're the one who wished for it, aren't you?
JOHN: Don't look so surprised. You're the one who wished for it, aren't you?
TEDDY: Don't look so surprised. You're the one who wished for it, aren't you?
JOHN: Yeah, I. I did wish for it.
TEDDY: Well, here I am.
JOHN: You mean. we get to be best friends. for real?
TEDDY: For real.
JOHN: Forever and ever?
TEDDY: Sounds good to me. A huge grin spreads across John's face. He gets up, runs to Teddy and hugs him.
JOHN'S MOM: Well, I think we had a wonderful Christmas this year.
JOHN'S DAD: One of the best.
JOHN: Mom! Dad! Guess what?! My teddy bear's John's Mom and Dad look at each other and smile.
JOHN'S MOM: ( PLAYING ALONG )
JOHN: No mom, he's alive! For real! Look! Teddy walks in and stands next to John.
TEDDY: Merry Christmas, everybody! John's Dad scrambles to his feet, knocking plates off the table. John's mom screams.
JOHN'S DAD: Jesus H. Fuck!
TEDDY: Let's all be best friends!
JOHN'S MOM: Oh my god.
JOHN'S DAD: John, get away from that thing! Come over here, right now!
JOHN: BUT DAD JOHN'S DAD
BUT DAD: JOHN'S DAD
JOHN'S DAD: GET OVER HERE! John reluctantly walks over to his dad, who grabs him and protectively pulls him aside.
JOHN: Dad, no!
TEDDY: Is it a hugging gun?
JOHN'S DAD: Helen, get my gun, and call the police!
TEDDY: I'm sorry, Mr. Bennett. I didn't mean to scare anybody. I just wanted John and I to be friends.
JOHN: Yeah, Dad! I made a wish last night that Teddy was alive, and my wish came true!
JOHN'S MOM: ( ASTONISHED WHISPER )
NEWSCASTER: Out of a Boston suburb comes what is, without a doubt, the most incredible story in the history of broadcast news.

JOHN: Yeah, John?
TEDDY: Yeah, John?
JOHN: Do you promise we'll always be together?
TEDDY: I promise. Another thunder clap.
JOHN: Thunder buddies for life.

JOHN: That's bullshit, what about Lori? She's Lori's from Pennsylvania, not a Boston They're not that bad. John takes a hit from the bong over Ted's next line.
TED: Lori's from Pennsylvania, not a Boston They're not that bad. John takes a hit from the bong over Ted's next line.
JOHN: They're not that bad. John takes a hit from the bong over Ted's next line.
TED: The fact that you have to say they're not that bad means that they are that bad. They turn into drunk, half-white, half- pink monsters after 2 hours at any beach. Ted takes a hit from the bong.
JOHN: I It's workin' for me.
TED: I think it sucks, I'm gonna have a talk with him.
JOHN: Yeah, I don't know that you wanna go to a drug dealer with complaints.
TED: No, I know this guy a long time. I've known him since 9/11. Remember, I was like, "Aw, shit. 9/11. I gotta get ( looks at his watch ) Oh fuck, is it nine-thirty? Shit, I gotta get to work. John gets up, and hurries into the other room to get Hey, you mind pickin' up a bird feeder on the way home? I wanna start enjoying the beauty of birds.

THOMAS: What do you mean?
JOHN: ( BEAT )
THOMAS: John, all you have to do is not fuck up, and you get my job when I go to corporate next month. You will be the new branch manager. All you have to do is not fuck up, and all you're doing is fucking up. Not that I don't think you're too fucked up to handle not fucking up my job, but you happen to be the least fucked-up person in the whole office. The next least fucked-up is Alix, and you've been here three fucking years longer than him. But I'm telling you, I will promote the fuck out of him if you fuck up one more time. That is all. Fuck.
JOHN: Sir, I promise, you're not gonna regret promoting the fuck out of me.
THOMAS: Good. I like hearing that. Because in a month my life now could be your life: a cushy $38,000-a-year branch manager who's personal friends with Tom Skerritt. It's not a bad life, is it?
JOHN: ( CONTINUED ) THOMAS ( CONT'D )
THOMAS: Did you know I'm friends with Tom I'll show you something I don't show too many people, because I don't want anyone treating me differently. Thomas takes out a framed picture of himself with Tom That's me and Tom Skerritt.

GUY: I don't know. I dig chicks. I don't remember any of it, I was so fucked up. I might be gay, I don't know. You mind covering for me for a bit? I'm gonna go lay down in the john.
ALIX: Hey you buddies. Where's it hanging?
ALIX: Ah, I didn't get in because the bouncer was doucheface, but I made friends in the Oh, well, that's good I guess. We see TANYA, an unbelievably gorgeous salesgirl, enter from the back with a set of keys.
GUY: Oh, well, that's good I guess. We see TANYA, an unbelievably gorgeous salesgirl, enter from the back with a set of keys.
TANYA: Hi you guys. Over the following, Tanya puts the keys away, walks over to her station and sits.

TANYA: Aw, thanks Alix, I worked out this I can tell, you are less fat than you have been.
ALIX: I can tell, you are less fat than you have been.

JOHN: Like what?
TANYA: Well, if I were her, I'd be expecting a Oh come on, nobody's expecting anybody to propose. Marriage isn't. I mean, isn't love enough? I submit that love is You could put the ring in her ass and let her fart it out.

TED: Oh, fuck that! It's four years! You and I have been together 27 years! Ted jumps on John, and starts playfully punching him in the face.
JOHN: Stop it! Jesus Christ, knock it off! He throws Ted off of him.
TED: No, John. It's a bad idea. And it's the wrong time. What with the economy and. the credit bubble. the Supreme Court. I mean, look at Haiti.
JOHN: I guess I didn't think about that. ANGLE ON TV - We see Flash Gordon facing Ming the KLYTUS ( ON TV ) Who are you?
JOHN: This is the American fantasy, right here. A professional NFL player is called upon to save the world.
TED: Tom Brady could do that.
JOHN: Tom Brady could do that. The front door opens and LORI, an attractive girl in her mid to late 20's, enters holding several grocery bags.
LORI: Hi guys.
JOHN: Hey, sweetie.
TED: Hey, Lori. John gets up and gives Lori a kiss.
LORI: Ooh. I think you just got me stoned.
JOHN: ( RE: GROCERIES )
LORI: Turkey burgers.
TED: Oh. Okay. Are we having homos over for dinner or something?
LORI: ( WISEASS )
TED: She's funny, John. You got yourself a regular Toni Collette.
LORI: Wait, who's that? Is that good?
JOHN: She's a comedienne.
LORI: Oh nice. Is she pretty?

LORI: How's your dickhead boss?
JOHN: How's your dickhead boss?
LORI: Rex is fine. He only hit on me once today, so that's good.
JOHN: I'm not saying this to be mean, but I really hope that fucker gets leukemia.
LORI: He's harmless, I can handle it.
TED: Hey Johnny, while you're up, grab me a beer, huh?
JOHN: ( crossing to fridge ) Oh yeah, a coupla' Charles Brew-Kowskis?
TED: Yes, a Brew-stoy-ovski would be nice right about now. We see Lori roll her eyes. She's heard this before.
LORI: Maybe a Mike Brew-ga-slow-ski?
JOHN: Maybe a Mike Brew-ga-slow-ski?
TED: Perhaps a Ted Kazyn-brewski?
LORI: Y'know, I think I might also have a Martina Navra-ti-brewski.
LORI: Bullshit, what do you mean?
JOHN: It doesn't work, the name has to have a "ski" at the end of it. You just put "brewski" on the end of Martina I thought we were just doing funny names.
LORI: I thought we were just doing funny names.
TED: No, it's gotta have a "ski" at the end. Otherwise where's the challenge? If there's no "ski" at the end of the root word, then we would just be idiots saying EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT It's raining, with an occasional roll of thunder.
LORI: ( OFF IPAD )
JOHN: They did? What happened?
LORI: It says they got separated and one of them had his foot trapped under a rock for five days.
JOHN: You know, if your leg got trapped under a rock, I'd chew it off to get you free.
LORI: ( SWEETLY )
JOHN: I sure would.
LORI: No, I think it's only cannibalism if you Oh yeah, no, I don't swallow. She laughs.
JOHN: Oh yeah, no, I don't swallow. She laughs.
LORI: Really? That's not what I heard about It's not true, I'm a fuckin' classy I can see that.
JOHN: It's not true, I'm a fuckin' classy I can see that.
LORI: ( LAUGHS AGAIN )
JOHN: You kiddin' me? Four years we been going out, I'm takin' you to the best place in town. I been crappin' out room for it for two days, I know exactly what I'm gonna order.
LORI: ( leaning in to kiss him ) You're disgusting.
JOHN: And you get to pick any bottle of wine.
LORI: Any bottle of 2012 wine.
JOHN: Any bottle of 2012 wine.
LORI: Oh, are the new wines in?
JOHN: They are in and they. Are. Fresh. She leans over and kisses him again. He kisses her back.
LORI: I love you, too. They continue to kiss, becoming more and more intimate. She starts to pull his T-shirt off, when there is a thunder clap from outside.
JOHN: Ah, come on!
LORI: ( shaking her head ) I don't understand it, 35 years old, and you're still scared of a little thunder.
JOHN: I am not. We hear another thunderclap. Ted runs into the room with no warning and leaps into bed, right between Lori and Thunder buddies for life, right Johnny? C'mon, let's sing the thunder song!
TED: Thunder buddies for life, right Johnny? C'mon, let's sing the thunder song!
TED: ( CONTINUED )
GINA: Wow.Baby, I'm not saying this to be nasty, but you look really tired.
LORI: Oh, I'm okay. except I didn't have time for breakfast, the garage was full, I spilled coffee on my leg, and I have a boyfriend who can't sleep through a storm without his teddy bear.
GINA: I don't understand why you keep putting up with him.
TRACY: Yeah, I mean, the guy's thirty-five years old and he's working for a rental car No, it's not that, I don't care about that. I'd love him even if he was a janitor. I mean, he's got a huge heart, we laugh together all the time, and it's just a bonus that he's like the hottest guy in Boston.
LORI: No, it's not that, I don't care about that. I'd love him even if he was a janitor. I mean, he's got a huge heart, we laugh together all the time, and it's just a bonus that he's like the hottest guy in Boston.
GINA: Yeah but the hottest guy in Boston is like being the classiest Kardashian.
LORI: I just wish he could get his life together, you know? Our life. And he can't, and I swear to god, it's all because of that bear.
MICHELLE: You should give him an ultimatum: it's you or the bear.
LORI: I can't do that, he'd be devastated. And I mean. what if he chose Ted?
MICHELLE: Oh come on, you don't really think that.
LORI: Not really, but what if?
MICHELLE: Well then. things happen for a reason.
TRACY: No they don't. That's just something girls say when something bad happens to them that they don't understand.
GINA: Fuck off, Tracy.
REX: Well hello there. Sorry if I'm interrupting any private girl talk about Channing Tatum's index finger but Lori I need to see you in my office.
LORI: Actually Rex, I have a lot of work I need to get to
REX: Oh, this is work, I swear.
LORI: ( SIGH )
MICHELLE: He's such an asshole.
GINA: Out of control. Such a sleaze.
TRACY: You guys are so pathetic. You're shitting on Rex, and you both had sex with him. Short beat.
GINA: And so did you.
TRACY: Well, I didn't want one of you whores getting promoted before me.
LORI: So. what do you need to talk to me about, Rex? Rex takes a framed picture out of a drawer, and shows it to her.
REX: See that? That's me on the diving team in high school. We dove the shit outta that pool that year. If you look close, you can see the outline of my root.
LORI: ( ANNOYED )
REX: Lori, what is wrong with you? Why don't you like me? I'm rich, I'm good-looking, my dad owns the company
LORI: I have a boyfriend, Rex. I think you know this.
REX: Yeah, the guy with the teddy bear, that's a cute relationship, but I'm talking about being with a real man, Lori.
LORI: ( STANDING UP )
REX: Well then, how do you have all that time to be in my head?
LORI: Goodbye, Rex. Lori exits Rex's office. Rex casually gets up, strolls over to her chair, nonchalantly brushes his hand on the cushion where she was sitting, and nonchalantly smells his hand.
NIGHT: INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS John and Lori sit across from each other at a romantically set table. They've just finished their meal. John has the remains of a lobster shell on his A WAITRESS approaches.

JOHN: Actually, could you wrap just this up for me? I wanna scare the shit outta The waitress walks away.
WAITRESS: ( BEAT ) ( CONTINUED )
LORI: ( MILDLY AMUSED )
JOHN: Yeah, but I read at a six year-old level. Another WAITER approaches with a bottle of champagne, two glasses, and some chocolate-covered strawberries.
WAITER: Senor. Senora, here is your dessert and Ooh, Cristal.
LORI: Ooh, Cristal.
JOHN: It's a special night. We've been dating for four years.
LORI: It doesn't seem like four years, does it?
JOHN: ( affectionately taking her
HAND ): No, it doesn't.
LORI: You had no business being out on that dance floor, but I'm glad you were.
JOHN: Oh my god, are you okay? Oh god, I'm so ( a little stunned ) Yeah, I'm. I'm fine.
LORI: ( a little stunned ) Yeah, I'm. I'm fine.
JOHN: Oh Jesus, I'm so so sorry! I didn't see you! It was an accident!
LORI: Well, yeah, I. I would hope it was an Did you hurt your head?
JOHN: Did you hurt your head?
LORI: Um, yes. My head hurts a lot.
JOHN: Oh, man. Here, let me get you some ice. She sits down. He reaches into a nearby glass, pulls out a handful of ice, and wraps it in a napkin. He puts it against her head. She inhales sharply for a moment.
LORI: ( beat, noticing him for the
JOHN: ( beat, noticing too ) I'm. I'm John.
LORI: I'm Lori. They smile at each other.
LORI: Okay, here's a question that'll show how much you actually care about me. You remember we stayed and talked until the place closed, and then we went for late night eggs and waffles, and we stayed there til 5 a.m. watching a movie on the little TV in the diner. Name the movie.
JOHN: Gold star.
LORI: Gold star.
JOHN: But does that show that I care about you, or I care about Roger Moore?
LORI: I'm gonna give you the benefit of the Thank you. And by the way, my dancing was not that bad.
JOHN: Thank you. And by the way, my dancing was not that bad.
LORI: ( LAUGHING )
JOHN: I had some cool moves.
LORI: So do people with Parkinson's.
JOHN: That's not how I remember it.
LORI: Yeah, how do you remember it?
LORI: Whatever you say, baby.
JOHN: Hey, here's to four more years, huh? They clink glasses, and take a sip.
LORI: No, we didn't.
JOHN: But, I got you something anyway, in clear violation of the "no gift" rule.
LORI: There was no such rule. John reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small box. Lori looks excited.
JOHN: Lori, I've wanted to give this to you for a long time. John slides the box over to Lori. She picks it up.
LORI: Oh, John. Lori unwraps the box and opens it. Inside is a pair of nice, but not-super-expensive-looking earrings.
JOHN: Those are the ones you liked, right? From that kiosk at the mall?
LORI: Oh. Yeah.
JOHN: Check out the card. She opens up the card, which we see as John describes it. It says, "Happy 4 year anniversary! Love you."
LORI: ( UNENTHUSED )
JOHN: ( OPENS BOX )
LORI: I remember you liked it when you saw Tom Brady wearing one in GQ.
JOHN: Yeah, I mean his was analog, but this is so awesome, I love it! She reacts a bit to this.
LORI: John, I don't need the Hope diamond, all I want is
JOHN: I know, but it's important to me that you have the engagement ring you deserve. And what with the credit bubble. the Supreme Court. I mean, look at Haiti.
LORI: Look, I'm only saying this because I love you, but that's not realistic. You're never gonna have any kind of a career if you're always partying and wasting time with Ted.
JOHN: Oh, Jesus, here we go
LORI: John, please get him to find his own place, so we can get on with our lives.
JOHN: Look, can we talk about this another time, and just enjoy our anniversary Yeah. Fine. Let's talk about it ten years from now.
LORI: Yeah. Fine. Let's talk about it ten years from now.
JOHN: ( rolling his eyes with a
SIGH ): Lori, we can't talk about this every time we go out. Look, he's been my best friend since I was eight. And I was not a popular child. You have to understand, I had no friends before he came along. He's the only reason I ever gained any fucking confidence. I coulda wound up like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but I didn't. `Cause of him. So, y'know, I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick him out.
LORI: Well, it's good to know that a talking teddy bear is the only thing that kept you from gunning down your classmates, but John, you're not eight. You're thirty-five. And unless you're too blind to notice, he's not your only friend anymore. You have me. And I love you.
JOHN: I love you, too. You know that.
LORI: Look, I've put the best physical years of my life into this. I mean, I'm cute now, but in a few years my body's gonna fall off a fucking cliff. Things'll be hanging and stretching in ways that might scare a man. I need to feel secure in the fact that you won't leave me when that happens.
JOHN: Not only will I not leave you, it's gonna be even better. `Cause I can have sex with you, and press your arm fat against a comic book so I can see it backwards. She laughs. So does he.
LORI: And, my boobs and vagina will all be in the same place, so that's a lot less movin' around for you.
JOHN: I can do it all with one hand.
LORI: Exactly, and you can do whatever you want with the other hand.
JOHN: I can write a novel. Maybe a bestseller.
LORI: We can achieve critical acclaim and become rich just by screwing each other. They both laugh hard.
JOHN: Well, I hope these jokes have distracted you from the actual problems in our We can't put the real conversation off forever, John.
LORI: ( SIGH )
JOHN: I dunno, I got a lotta fuckin' jokes.
JOHN: ( NOTICING )
LORI: That's my ringtone?
JOHN: ( laughs, embarrassed ) Oh, yeah.
LORI: What is it? It sounds negative.
JOHN: No, it's from The Notebook. He reaches under the seat, fishing for the phone, as she goes inside.
LORI: All right, well I'll see you upstairs. He continues digging for the phone, as she walks inside.
LORI: What the hell is all this?!
TED: Lori! Hey, you're home early! The ladies and I were just watching "Romancing the Stone." Got it on Blu- Ray. Came in a two-pack with "Jewel of the Nile," but I don't know that we'll end up watchin' that one.
LORI: This place is a wreck! Who are these Oh, where are my manners? Lori, this is Angelique, Heavenly, Cherene, and Sauvignon Blanc. I love you girls. Y'know, somewhere out there are four terrible fathers I wish I could thank for this great night. The girls ad-lib "Hello," "Nice to meet you," etc.

GUESS: What the fuck!!!!
LORI: What the fuck!!!!
TED: Lori, if I can now this is just speculation, but. is it possible that this is not so much about the stool in the corner, and more about maybe tonight's dinner not measuring up to your What!!! The fuck!!! Lori is speechless with rage. At that moment, we see the lobster head poke in aggressively from behind the door.

TED: God, there are some fucked up fish out Jesus, look at that one. Mister tough guy fish. ( tough guy voice: ) "Hey! Whatsa big idea? Cold fusion? Well that is a big idea, I beg pardon!" Look at that guy. WASP-y white guy fish. ( tight-ass white guy voice: ) "I don't care for some of Conan O'Brien's humor. I don't like Irish humor. And this food is too flavorful. I don't care for flavor in my food."

BY ): "Oh hey, sorry I'm late, guys. Hey, where's everybody goin'? Any of you guys got a tissue? I'm allergic to water."
JOHN: Ted. you gotta move out. Ted turns and stares at John for a beat.
TED: Wh. what?
JOHN: It's. it's gotta happen. Ted sits down on a bench, a little stunned and dazed.
TED: What.what did I do? John looks heartbroken at this response.
JOHN: Ted, my relationship is at a very delicate stage, and, y'know, Lori and I may just need a little space right now. Plus a hooker took a shit in our Hey, look, that was a tough night for all of us.
TED: Hey, look, that was a tough night for all of us.
LORI: ( BEYOND DISGUSTED )
JOHN: Aaaa, what?!
LORI: It's so gross!!
JOHN: Don't tell me, I don't wanna hear about it! Did you get it?
LORI: No! Oh my god!
JOHN: Tell me when you get it!
LORI: AAAA, I got some on my thumb!
JOHN: AAAAA! You can never cook with that hand again! I'm serious, learn to cook other- I'll get the next one, okay?
LORI: I'll get the next one, okay?
JOHN: I'll get the next one, okay?
TED: She's makin' you do it, isn't she?
JOHN: ( giving up the bullshit ) Yes. But, that doesn't mean we can't hang out. We'll hang out all the time!
TED: What about. thunder buddies for life, I know. Fuck. I just don't know what to do here. I know it sucks, but otherwise I'm gonna lose her. And I do love her, I know you do, Johnny.
JOHN: I know. Fuck. I just don't know what to do here. I know it sucks, but otherwise I'm gonna lose her. And I do love her, I know you do, Johnny.
TED: ( SIGH )
JOHN: I'll help you get on your feet out there, I promise.
TED: And we'll hang out a lot, right?
JOHN: Fuck, all the time.
TED: ( arms wide for a hug ) Bring it over here. John hugs Ted. Ted hugs him back. We hear a squeak, and a high-pitched recorded voice saying "I wuv you." John and Ted pull away from each other uncomfortably.
JOHN: We've got to get you a job.
TED: I look stupid.
JOHN: No, you don't. You look dapper.
TED: I look like Snuggles' accountant. They pause as John straightens Ted's tie.
JOHN: Look, I know it sucks, but you gotta make some money so you can pay for an I don't wanna work at a grocery store.
TED: I don't wanna work at a grocery store.
JOHN: Well, you have no skills.
TED: I told you, I can totally be a lawyer.
JOHN: As I said, you would need a law degree from a law school.
TED: I'm a special case. I'm a fucking talking bear. They might make an exception `cause they're all like, "Aaa! This bear can talk and do stuff! Let's give him a job and maybe he'll give us a few laughs," but then they're surprised at what a stellar performance I'm turnin' in. And then they practically have to give me the Anderson case.
JOHN: Look, you get the job, and we'll celebrate after. John discreetly pulls out a baggie of weed.
TED: And if I don't get the job will we still smoke that pot?
JOHN: Probably, yes.
TED: ( patting John on the leg ) Yeah. Okay, good speech, coach.
FRANK: So. You think you got what it takes?
TED: ( a beat, then ) No one's ever talked to me like that before. You're hired.
FRANK: ( a beat, then ) No one's ever talked to me like that before. You're hired.
TED: EXT. BOSTON COMMON - LATE AFTERNOON ( Over music: ) John and Ted walk across the Common, passing various park-goers. The occasional person notices and points with a "Hey, isn't that." sort of look. They passes three cute girls who flag Ted down. Two pose with him as the third takes their picture with her cellphone. Ted poses for the photo with one hand on the girl's breast. She laughs hard. Ted waves goodbye, and he and John make their way over to a park bench. They sit. John takes out the weed, looks around for a beat, then starts to discreetly roll a joint.
TED: Well, I'm a former celebrity with a minimum wage job. This must be what the cast of Different Strokes feels like.
O.S. VOICE: Excuse me. John and Ted react, startled. John stuffs the weed in his pocket, accidentally dropping the buds in the rolling papers on the ground. ANGLE ON a creepy-looking man glancing at them repeatedly. This is Donny, the fat kid we saw in the prologue. He has grown up into a thinner but no less creepy man.
DONNY: I'm sorry to bother you, but my son and I couldn't help but admire your teddy bear. ADJUST TO REVEAL his son, who looks exactly like fat young Donny from earlier.
JOHN: ( a little uncomfortable ) Oh. Um, thank you.
DONNY: I'm Donny. And this is my boy, Robert. I have to tell you, I've been fascinated by your story ever since I was a boy. I remember seeing you on the Carson show. You were just wonderful. BRIEF ANGLE ON the ground, where a pigeon is pecking at the dropped weed.
TED: Yeah, that was ah. that was a good I wonder, is there any chance I could purchase the bear from you? For my son?
DONNY: ( TO JOHN )
ROBERT: ( CALM )
TED: Hey, I'm not an "it", pal. I'm a "he."
JOHN: ( leaning down to his level ) I'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't for sale. I've had him since I was about your age. He's very special to me.
ROBERT: Sit up straight when you talk to me.
JOHN: ( RECOILING )
DONNY: Don't swear in front of my child. Now. We are very interested in the bear. If you'd like to work out some sort of arrangement, here's my address and phone He writes on a slip of paper and hands it to John. John smiles awkwardly and puts it in his wallet.
JOHN: Okay. Will do. Here it goes, in the really important pocket for really important stuff. Donny and Robert walk off. Donny turns and steals a glance back at Ted as they move off.
TED: Wow. Can you imagine what that little shit would do to me?
JOHN: Oh man, I can totally see him just taking you down to the basement and really slowly de-limbing you while singing some creepy Victorian nursery rhyme. John tugs on one of Ted's arms trying to creep him out. He then breaks into a creepy falsetto.
TED: Fuck you. Why do you have to take it so far? Now it's real. Fuck you again for that. C'mon, let's go find a better place to get stoned. They exit. After a beat, the pigeon flies into frame, slamming right into a fucking tree.
JOHN: Well. I guess this is it, huh?
TED: Yeah, sure is.
JOHN: First night on your own.
TED: Yeah. First night in my beautiful new apartment. They say they're ain't hardly been no murders here. They awkwardly nod to each other, both knowing that John must leave soon.
JOHN: Okay. so. if you need anything.
TED: I know.
JOHN: Seriously, anything.
TED: I know. I'll be fine, Johnny.
JOHN: ( BEAT )
LORI: Hey there.
JOHN: Listen. I just wanna say thank you. What you did with Ted was a big step, and I know it wasn't easy, but I just want you to know that I love you for it. And, I think this a new beginning for our Hey, anything for you. This is all part of the new grown up, adult John Bennett. So, get used to him. She gives him a kiss, and starts to undo his tie.
LORI: Listen. I just wanna say thank you. What you did with Ted was a big step, and I know it wasn't easy, but I just want you to know that I love you for it. And, I think this a new beginning for our Hey, anything for you. This is all part of the new grown up, adult John Bennett. So, get used to him. She gives him a kiss, and starts to undo his tie.
JOHN: Hey, anything for you. This is all part of the new grown up, adult John Bennett. So, get used to him. She gives him a kiss, and starts to undo his tie.
LORI: Y'know, I don't have to be at work for another twenty minutes.
JOHN: ( guiding her down onto the
COUCH ): Ooh, that's perfect, I'm only gonna need She laughs, and they kiss.
LORI: You know what my favorite thing about you is? After four years, you can still surprise me. To step up and change such a big part of your life just to make your girlfriend happier. I dunno, I bet you most guys couldn't do it.
JOHN: Most guys don't have you to motivate `em.
LORI: I'm sorry if I was pushy about it.
JOHN: No, you were right! Look, the reason I love you so much is the same reason I guess I take you for granted sometimes. It's `cause you're. inevitable.
LORI: ( huh? ) Inevitable. Well, that's. romantic? I No, what I mean is, there's just no version of this universe where you and I don't end up together. You're That sounds like something Stephen Hawking would say to his girlfriend.
JOHN: No, what I mean is, there's just no version of this universe where you and I don't end up together. You're That sounds like something Stephen Hawking would say to his girlfriend.
LORI: That sounds like something Stephen Hawking would say to his girlfriend.
JOHN: But do you get what I'm saying?
LORI: Yeah, I do. And I feel exactly the same way about you. They kiss.
NOTICES ): Ooh. Is that a Flash Gordon ray gun in your pocket or are you glad to see me? John pulls the Flash Gordon gun out of his pocket and shows it to her. She cracks up.
TED: Thank you, please come again, we have a lot more groceries. The customer exits. Ted sighs with boredom. He turns to ELLEN, the large African-American woman at the next Hey Ellen?
ELLEN: Who's that over there? ANGLE ON A VERY ATTRACTIVE blonde girl bagging groceries a few aisles away ( This is TAMI-LYNN ).
TED: Who's that over there? ANGLE ON A VERY ATTRACTIVE blonde girl bagging groceries a few aisles away ( This is TAMI-LYNN ).
ELLEN: That's the new bag girl. I don't know her name, but she seems cute.
TED: Yeah. Very cute. You know what I'd like to do to her? Somethin' I call a Dirty Ted waves to the girl. She waves back. He makes a kissy face at her. She giggles and blows him a kiss back. He pantomimes hard, thrusting, standing-up sex. Her eyes widen for a beat, as she stares, then smiles. He grabs an Oh Henry bar, and pantomimes fellatio. The girl laughs hysterically. CLOSE ANGLE on Ted, as white liquid sprays all over his face from one side, then from the other. WIDEN to reveal he's squirting two bottles of pump hand soap on either side of him. The girl laughs and shakes her head "no."
TANYA: Hey. How you holding up?
JOHN: Oh, I'm all right. Just. getting used to things, that's all.
TANYA: It's gonna be all right. Y'know, I went through something like this with my last Yeah, we were dating for eight months, and I was really in love with him, and then he was deported back to Iran. So, I get it.
JOHN: Yeah, we were dating for eight months, and I was really in love with him, and then he was deported back to Iran. So, I get it.
TANYA: Yeah, we were dating for eight months, and I was really in love with him, and then he was deported back to Iran. So, I get it.
JOHN: Oh. yeah. So. I guess we both lost our furry little guy.
TANYA: John's phone rings the theme from "Knight Rider." He sees Ted's name pop up, with a photo of Ted smiling open- mouthed at the camera, with his arms outstretched and a bra on his head. John picks up.
JOHN: Hey, Ted.
JOHN: I could probably swing by after work.
JOHN: I can't just ditch work, man. Look, I'm trying to get my shit together and be an adult here, y'know? For Lori's sake.
TED: John. Five minutes. And then I'll kick you out, I promise. C'mon, I picked up the "Cheers" DVD box set, and supposedly everybody talks shit about each other in the interviews.
JOHN: Yeah, and apparently George Wendt confesses to a rape.
TED: Yeah, and apparently George Wendt confesses to a rape.
JOHN: ( BEAT )
TED: They do, John. Sometimes they do.
JOHN: You'll kick me out in five.
JOHN: What do I tell Thomas?
TED: Just tell him you don't feel well.
JOHN: I gotta duck out for a bit. Lori tried to break up a dog fight, and I guess she got hurt pretty bad.
THOMAS: Oh my god.
JOHN: Yeah, she's that's the way she is, she sees trouble, she tries to help out, and I guess one of these dogs clamped his jaws on her forearm, and he wouldn't let go until the fireman showed up and had to stick his finger in his ass.
THOMAS: Jesus, John.
JOHN: Yeah, she's pretty shook up.
THOMAS: Oh my god.
JOHN: Yeah, that's how they
THOMAS: That's how they get `em to stop biting, Go go go, take care of it, let me know how she is.
JOHN: Go go go, take care of it, let me know how she is.
THOMAS: Go go go, take care of it, let me know how she is.
JOHN: Oh gosh, thank you, sir. I owe you one.
THOMAS: You don't owe me anything, go. John smiles wanly, and exits.
TED DANSON: Was there cocaine on the set of "Cheers"? Hm. Lemme figure out the best way to answer that. Um.are there naked dicks in gay porn?
JOHN: You know, he's exactly who you want him to be.
TED: He is. He is. Someone the likes of which we should all aspire to become.
TED DANSON: Woody Harrelson. Smallest dick I've ever seen on a man. ANGLE BACK ON John and Ted -
TED: ( passing him bong ) Here, try this stuff. I told my guy to step it up, and he gave me this.
JOHN: What is it?
TED: It's called Kennedy's Head. It's actually pretty mellow.
JOHN: That doesn't sound very mellow.
TED: No, it's it makes you cerebral. Like Kennedy. Kennedy was smart. That's what it refers to. Decisions under pressure. Cuban missile crisis. Go on, spark it John takes a hit off the bong, then glances around.
JOHN: Y'know, this place looks great.
TED: Yeah, it's all Ikea. Did the whole apartment for 47 dollars.
JOHN: How are the neighbors?
TED: There's an Asian family next door, but they don't have a gong or nothin', so it's fine.
JOHN: That's lucky.
TED: How's work?
JOHN: It's actualy not bad. Met a girl. She's a bagger.
TED: It's actualy not bad. Met a girl. She's a bagger.
JOHN: It's actualy not bad. Met a girl. She's a bagger.

JOHN: Hey, well. it sounds like everything worked out then.
LORI: Or Jesus, yeah, but whatever.
TED: Hey, isn't this great? The four of us here, having dinner together? Lori, how've you been? Haven't seen you in Um, I've been good. Not much going on. My company's 20th anniversary is next week, that's something.
LORI: Um, I've been good. Not much going on. My company's 20th anniversary is next week, that's something.
JOHN: ( proud, to Tami-Lynn ) Lori's a senior VP at a big PR firm.
LORI: It's not that big a deal.
TED: Company's turnin' 20, eh? So you can bang it but you can't get it drunk. Tami-Lynn laughs heartily at this, as does John. Lori isn't quite as delighted.
LORI: ( VISIBLY ANNOYED )
TED: Well, it's funny, usually the first item on our agenda is "what's goin' on with Lori?" So I'm surprised that one slipped through the cracks.
JOHN: We do, we talk about you all the time.
TED: Oh my god, remember, Ted, last week we were talking about. how. neat all of Lori's shoes are?
JOHN: Oh my god, remember, Ted, last week we were talking about. how. neat all of Lori's shoes are?
TED: That was a lengthy conversation.
JOHN: And we were saying like, a lot of women look like unsteady horses when they wear high heels, but Lori has a sort of. regal. trot.
TED: A canter.
JOHN: Oh my god yes. You canter. Lori stares at him for a beat, then:
LORI: So, Tami, where are you from? Tell us about yourself. I'm always. fascinated to meet Ted's girlfriends.
TED: No, no, that's not what she's sayin' at all, right Lori?
LORI: No, right, I was all I was doing was asking. Ted's very. attractive, I'm just always interested in the. type of girl that can snatch him up.
LORI: What? No, I
LORI: I was just asking a question.
TED: It's okay, Tami.
LORI: What?! It's not my fault she can't speak Fuck you! Just `cause you're all in the business world and shit, you think everyone's supposed to like, suck your Baby! Baby! Baby. Baby. Let's get outta here. We'll go back to my place for a couple vodka and strawberry Quiks. Okay? See ya, John. Ted and Tami Lynn exit leaving John and Lori at the What a cunt.

LORI: What a cunt.
JOHN: ( covering ears in pain ) Ooh! I hate that word.
LORI: That word is so sharp. It's like an electric sword, slashing everything in its path.
JOHN: That word is so sharp. It's like an electric sword, slashing everything in its path.
LORI: Well, you didn't exactly stick up for me.
JOHN: I. I'm trying to walk a line here, I want to be fair to you and to him, Yeah, well, I think you're being a little more fair to him.
LORI: Yeah, well, I think you're being a little more fair to him.
JOHN: ( SCOFFING )
LORI: Y'know, your boss called this morning and asked me how my arm was.
JOHN: ( CAUGHT )
LORI: Yeah. Because of the dog fight I tried to break up.
JOHN: ( CONTINUED )
LORI: If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say that was some bullshit lie you made up so you could take off work and go to Ted's. Am I right?
JOHN: ( BEAT )
LORI: John, Ted moved out so we could give ourselves a chance without him. You're not really giving anything a chance if you're blowing off work to get high with your teddy bear.
JOHN: It won't happen again, I promise.
LORI: ( with a bit of anger ) Yes. It will. A beat. She sighs.
JOHN: ( THROWN )
LORI: I'm just. I'm done. This isn't gonna work. We're in two different places.
JOHN: Lori, look, I know
LORI: You promised me you were gonna grow up and take our life together seriously.
JOHN: Hey, Ted moved out, didn't he? I did that for you for us! And it wasn't Jesus, he might as well still be living with us, John. You spend more time with him than you do with me.
LORI: Jesus, he might as well still be living with us, John. You spend more time with him than you do with me.
JOHN: Okay, look. I've been getting stoned too much. I know that. I've been bumming around with Ted too much, I know that, too. Give me one more chance, I promise I can fix it. Lori, I love you too much, please give me one more chance.
LORI: ( BEAT )
JOHN: I know. Done. Man, right here in front of you. Look at these pecs. Man pecs. Look at the hair on my upper lip. Man hair. I just farted. Man fart. Lori can't help but let a small laugh escape. She softens a bit.
LORI: John. this really is your last chance. I can't do this anymore.
JOHN: You won't have to. Trust me. I love He kisses her.
LORI: ( BEAT )
JOHN: Aw, sweetie, I love you so much! You won't be sorry, I swear. She smiles at him, then:
LORI: Did you really just fart?
JOHN: Yeah, but I pushed it that way with my Oh. Wonder where it'll hit first. WIDER ANGLE on the restaurant. For a moment, nothing Then, a guy at a table on the right ( sitting with a couple other men and women ) screams into his napkin, followed by his dining companions.

FRANK: What the hell? He walks over to the line. A GUY IN LINE turns and notices him.
FRANK: There's supposed to be three registers open, for god's sake! He looks around, aggravated, for a moment, then storms off toward the back. He looks around the butcher's counter and produce area, then walk into the back INT. STOREROOM - MOMENTS LATER Frank opens the door, and reacts with shock. REVERSE ANGLE where we see Ted on top of Tami Lynn, who is almost naked. He is doing a very close approximation of banging her wildly. We see his furry bear butt pumping away, with its little tail on the end. Frank screams in shock and horror.
FRANK: You had sexual intercourse with a coworker in a storeroom filled with produce that we sell to the public.
TED: ( BEAT )
FRANK: ( BEAT )
TED: EXT. GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT NIGHT We see the "CLOSED" sign on the door. Ted exits, finishing off a bottle of beer. He walks around to the dumpster alley, and lines up for a Kareem-style sky hook shot into a trash can. He takes the shot:
TED: The bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters.
DONNY: Hello, Ted.
TED: Gah! Uh. hi there.
DONNY: Are you all alone out here?
TED: Uh. no. No I'm not. I'm. you know, you're never alone when you're with You know, Robert and I could give you a very, very good home.
DONNY: You know, Robert and I could give you a very, very good home.
TED: I'm. I'm pretty happy where I am. I just got a shitty new apartment
DONNY: I can offer you six thousand dollars in railroad bonds. They were left to me by my father.
TED: Well, gosh, you know, since I just returned from active duty in the Civil War, that sounds really appealing. Oh wait, no, that was a hundred and fifty years ago, and I don't give a shit. Tami-Lynn approaches.
TED: Yeah, I'm comin', sweetheart.
DONNY: I really wish you wouldn't.
TED: Yeah, sorry. But, ah. you know, I'd like to thank you for creepin' up my night, and. Jesus be with you. In Ted hurries off. ANGLE ON DONNY, who looks eerily EXT./ ESTAB. REX'S HOUSE - NIGHT John and Lori walk up to the fabulously expansive house in Cambridge. It's a very impressive estate with no expense spared.
LORI: ( smiling at him warmly ) I'm glad you're here.
JOHN: Yeah, me too. Is it cool if I kick your boss' ass? That won't affect your workplace chemistry, will it?
LORI: Play nice. Please. Rex throws open the door.
REX: There she is! I was worried you weren't Hi kiddo, how ya doin'? Where's your bunny rabbit?
JOHN: He's a bear.
REX: ( ushering them in ) Got it. "Hey, this house is fucking huge!" I know guys, try not to get lost.
REX: Oh, here come the ladies. Gina, Michelle, and Tracy approach. Everyone adlibs their hellos to John and Lori. A waiter walks by with a tray of champagne. Lori and the girls each take a glass.
LORI: INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - STAIRS AND UPSTAIRS Rex and John are walking up the stairs to the second floor of his house. Rex points out various items bought at auction. John is visibly unenthused. He does not like this guy, and definitely does not trust him.
REX: .and that's a Wade Boggs autographed bat. Just barely outbid Phil Donahue for that at auction.
JOHN: Wow, cool.
REX: Yeah, cool. And those boxing gloves were worn by Joe Louis in his first fight. ( passing an abstract
PAINTING ): This is art. Do you get it? ( passing wall mounted pair of
JOHN: ( TOUCHING IT )
REX: That's Lance Armstrong's nut. John quickly pulls his hand away.
JOHN: That's inspiring. You've led a rich I've fucked the shit outta life.
REX: I've fucked the shit outta life.
JOHN: Things are great, actually.
REX: That's good, that's good.
JOHN: You know. Lori would hate me for saying this, but. she's told me how you are at the office, and. as one gentleman to another, I just wanna say I really hope you fucking get Lou Gehrig's disease.
REX: Whoa, whoa, okay, look, I think I oughtta just clear the air here a little. I. just want you to know that. I mean, yeah, I'm kind of a "fun-time boss" and whatnot, but. look man, I do that with everybody at the office! I'm just a kook! I have no designs on your girlfriend. We work together, and that's it. I think you're a great guy and she's very lucky. John is a bit surprised, not unpleasantly so, to hear Well. that's good to hear.
JOHN: Well. that's good to hear.
REX: Well, that's how it is, so.there we go.
JOHN: ( CONTINUED )
REX: They stand there for a beat, looking at Lance Armstrong's nut. John's phone rings the "Knight Rider" theme. John answers it.
JOHN: Hey, Ted. INTERCUT PERIODICALLY BETWEEN JOHN AND TED, who stands in the foreground with one finger in his ear. In the background, we see a party in full swing.
JOHN: Why? What's going on?
JOHN: TED ( V.O. ) Sam Jones. Flash fucking Gordon. Is Holy shit! How?
JOHN: Holy shit! How?
TED: Remember I said, my buddy's cousin is friends with Sam Jones? My buddy's in town with his cousin and who's with `em? Sam Jones!!
JOHN: ( EQUALLY SOFTLY )
TED: Get over here.
JOHN: Fuck! I can't. I'm with Lori. I'm already on probation here. John looks down at the main area of the party, and sees Lori happily chatting with her co-workers.
TED: John. There are moments in a man's life: Nathan Hale, "I regret that I have but one life to give for my country." Alan Hale, "Yes, I accept the role of the Skipper on `Gilligan's Island.'"
JOHN: ( beat, then: ) I'm coming. John hangs up.

TED: Johnny! Thank Christ you made it!
JOHN: ( QUICKLY )
TED: Okay, get ready, man. ( to someone O.S. ) Hey, Sam! This is the guy I was tellin' you about! John turns to look in the direction Ted is indicating. The shot slows down into slo-mo as John's eyes widen, and he sees. OPPOSITE ANGLE - Across the room, SAM J. JONES turns in slo-mo to face John. He is inexplicably still sporting the same hairstyle he had in the "Flash Gordon" movie. We hear the theme from "Flash Gordon." We INTERCUT back and forth from him to John: ON JOHN - He stands frozen in awe. ON SAM - He smiles as he begins to walk toward the camera, in John's POV. ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe. ON SAM - Still slowly walking toward camera in John's POV, but he is now dressed in the Flash Gordon costume. ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe.
TED: John, this is Sam Jones. Sam, this is my best friend in the whole world, John.
SAM: Hi there. Good to meet you.

JOHN: With you? Yes. Oh my god, yes. Sam passes out shots of Southern Comfort.

GUY #2: Let him try it, man.
GUY #1: Fuck it, all right. Guy #1 puts his hand down on the coffee table and Ted starts doing the knife trick from "Aliens". He gets it right for a few seconds, then stabs the guy right through the hand. The guy screams in pain.
TED: Well, you never shoulda trusted me, I'm on drugs!
JOHN: ( AS TED )
TED: Oh god, that was a fun day.
JOHN: ( AS TED )
TED: I do not sound that much like Peter INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER Ted sits on the couch drawing a pair of Garfield eyes on a topless girl. Below the eyes he has drawn the muzzle and the mouth, and above them the ears.
TED: See? There. Proof. Garfield's eyes look like a pair of tits.
TED: Okay, Johnny, c'mon up here and do this with me!
JOHN: No no.

TED'S BEDROOM - LATER Sam, John and Ted stand by the wall.
TED: See there's this one part of the wall that's really soft, you could punch through it wicked easy. Sam punches the wall a couple times, and his fist goes right through.
ASIAN MAN: What the hell you problem!! You break my wall! You break my wall I break you The neighbor sticks a knife through the hole. John, Ted, and Sam scream. Sam and John jump around and scream as they frantically try to get the knife.
JOHN: AAA! AAA!! Break his arm, Flash! Cut his arm off!! Sam grabs the arm, and it darts back inside.

ASIAN MAN: You pay many dollar for wall! This bullshit! This all bullshit!
SAM: DEATH TO MING!!! Sam charges the Asian man, tackling him. They both tumble over the back of the couch, nearly knocking it over. The duck flies out of his arms, landing on the floor. It immediately goes after Ted, who screams. ANGLE ON SAM, who chokes the Asian man on the floor. John struggles to pull him off.
JOHN: Sam, no! Get off him! ANGLE ON TED - who circles confrontationally with the duck, as in an Irish bar fight. ANGLE BACK ON THE GUYS FIGHTING - The Asian man jabs Sam in the eye with the other end of the spoon, and Sam goes staggering backward, falling into John. They land on the table, smashing it in half. They fall to the floor on top of each other.
ASIAN MAN: You crazy! You crazy man! The duck charges at Ted and slaps him across the face a few times with its wings.
TED: AAA! AAAA! OW!! The Asian man calls to the duck from the door.
ASIAN MAN: Come on, James Franco! The duck takes one last whack at Ted and waddles over to the Asian man, fluttering up into his arms.
JOHN: Hey. What's goin' on. This is Jared. He's the guy who beat me up. We're in Yeah. Turns out I'm gay or whatever. Had no idea. C'mon Jared, let's get a He and Jared walk off. ANGLE ON JOHN, who sits on the couch, looking zoned out and drained. Sam Jones approaches.

SAM: I gotta I gotta go! Shit! John scrambles to his feet, and runs for the front door.
JOHN: I gotta I gotta go! Shit! John scrambles to his feet, and runs for the front door.
JOHN: Lori. I. He throws up all over the floor.
JOHN: Lori! Lori wait! She hastily pays the cabbie who waits outside. John catches up to her and grabs her arm, but she shakes him off. She is clearly hurt, and on the verge of tears.
LORI: I want you out of the apartment. tonight. Gimme my car keys.
JOHN: Can I please just explain

TED: Oh come on, she'll go home, watch Bridget Jones' Somethin' Asshole, cry a little bit, she'll be fine, you'll talk to her Are you even listening to me?! Do you give any shred of a shit?! Ted pauses, realizing John is serious.
JOHN: ( EXPLODING )
TED: Well. `course I do, Johnny. Thunder buddies for life.
JOHN: Jesus, Lori was right. I should have stopped hanging out with you a long time ago. I'm never gonna have a life with you around. I'm 35 years old and I'm going nowhere. All I do is smoke pot and watch movies with a teddy fucking bear. And because of that, I just lost the love of my life.
TED: Johnny, I'm. I'm sorry.
JOHN: I just. I gotta be on my own, Ted. I can't see you anymore. John turns and walks away.
TED: Johnny, wait! Hey, listen!
REX: So, word through the grapevine is you are newly solo. I have tickets to see Norah Jones at the Hatch Shell tonight, and I would love it if you'd go with me.
LORI: You're asking me out the day after I broke up with someone.
REX: Look, I'm gonna cut the shit here.
LORI: This is the first time you've been single in all the years you've worked here. Just go out with me one time. And if you're miserable and you hate it, I promise I will never even hint at the subject again. Please.
REX: This is the first time you've been single in all the years you've worked here. Just go out with me one time. And if you're miserable and you hate it, I promise I will never even hint at the subject again. Please.
LORI: Rex, I don't think it's smart.
REX: Look, I'm an asshole. I know that. It worked for me in high school, and it's been like a reflex ever since.
LORI: Fine. I guess it beats crying myself to sleep every night.
REX: Great. Pick you up at seven?
JOHN: Who is it?
TED: Johnny, it's me.
JOHN: Go away.
TED: Johnny, open the door, please. I wanna John ignores him. A few beats go by, then the window slides open from the outside, and Ted tumbles in, landing on the floor, soaked.
JOHN: Ted shakes the water off himself like a dog. John flinches back, trying not to get wet.
JESUS: Ted shakes the water off himself like a dog. John flinches back, trying not to get wet.
TED: Sorry. Look, Johnny, I know you're pissed, but just listen to me for five seconds. I saw Lori out on a date with I'm serious, John, I went over to your house to talk to Lori to try and take some of the heat off you, and I saw Rex picking her up. They were going to the Hatch Shell.
JOHN: I'm serious, John, I went over to your house to talk to Lori to try and take some of the heat off you, and I saw Rex picking her up. They were going to the Hatch Shell.
TED: I'm serious, John, I went over to your house to talk to Lori to try and take some of the heat off you, and I saw Rex picking her up. They were going to the Hatch Shell.
JOHN: You're un-fucking-believable, you know that? How stupid do you think I am? First of all, Lori would never go out with Rex, and second of all, if you think that by making shit like that up you're gonna make me choose some kind of loyalty to you over her
TED: Johnny, it's the truth. I'm tellin' ya
JOHN: Get outta here.
TED: ( BEAT )
JOHN: What? I'm acting like a cock?
TED: Yes. You are actin' like a giant, V- shaped-funny-lookin'-guy-in-a-porno cock.
JOHN: `Member that porno we saw with the guy with the V-shaped cockforget it. What I'm sayin' is that you're blamin' me for somethin' you did to yourself. John glares at him.
TED: `Member that porno we saw with the guy with the V-shaped cockforget it. What I'm sayin' is that you're blamin' me for somethin' you did to yourself. John glares at him.
JOHN: Oh, and you can?
TED: I don't have to, I'm a fuckin' teddy bear! Y'know somethin', I didn't tie you up and drag you to that party. I wanted you to come because you're supposedly my best friend.
JOHN: Oh, yeah? Is that why you've manipulated me for years to stay eternally eight years old at the expense of the rest of my life?
TED: Whoa whoa, it's not my fault you didn't care enough about your relationship.
JOHN: You can't stand there and tell me you haven't always seen Lori as a threat to our friendship! It works out so much better for you when you and I are getting fucked up on the couch at 9 am, doesn't Wow. Listen to yourself. What am I, Emperor Ming here, controllin' your mind? That's your choice, John! And you know, by blamin' me, you just make yourself look like a pussy.
TED: Wow. Listen to yourself. What am I, Emperor Ming here, controllin' your mind? That's your choice, John! And you know, by blamin' me, you just make yourself look like a pussy.
JOHN: ( BEAT )
TED: ( BEAT )
JOHN: Teddy. Rux-fucking-pin.
TED: C'mon, motherfucker! John jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him. But Ted dodges, and John's fist goes into the wall above the headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again, and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall, and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down, whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach, clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor, yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face, and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on.
JOHN: My dick is in the TV. John continues to sob. Ted climbs down off the table and up onto the bed. He pushes the TV off John, then lies down next to him. Ted starts to sob himself.
TED: I'm so sorry, Johnny. I'm so sorry.
JOHN: So am I, man.
TED: I love you.
JOHN: I love you, too. John hugs Ted, who hugs him back.
TED: Listen. you gotta let me help you make things right with you and Lori.
JOHN: There is no putting things right. She hates me.
TED: No, John, we can get her back. Look, remember when you were ten, and you hit that squirrel with your BB gun, and then when we saw it fall from the tree we both starting crying? Remember? And then we ran up to it and tried to give it CPR? And it came back to life? John, we could do that again.
JOHN: Ted, we crushed its rib cage and blew out its lungs trying to give it CPR. It We can get Lori back.
TED: ( LONG BEAT )
REX: God, she's so brave. YOUR MUSIC IS SO
FUCKING BRAVE!!: Norah finishes the song.
NORAH: Thanks so much! We're gonna take a short break, but we'll be back in a few! The crowd cheers.
NORAH: ( turning, recognizing ) Teddy!! How you doin', you fuzzy little She hugs him.
TED: Well, I'm not a hot half-Muslim chick who sold 37 million records, but I'm hangin' in there.
NORAH: Well, half-Indian, but thanks.
TED: Eh, ooga booga, whatever. Hey, I want you to meet a good pal of mine. Hey Johnny, come on in!
JOHN: ( SELF-CONSCIOUSLY EXTENDS HAND )
HAND ): Hi. Hi, Norah Jones.
NORAH: ( shaking his hand ) Ha. Whoa, relax there, sweaty. You ready to bring down the house?
JOHN: Yes ma'am. Thank you for the opportunity, Ms. Ma'am Jones.
TED: Jesus, you look fantastic.
NORAH: Well, you're probably not used to seeing me fully clothed.
TED: Me and Norah met in 2002 at a party at Belinda Carlisle's house and we had awkward, fuzzy sex in the coatroom.
NORAH: Actually, you weren't so bad for a guy with no penis.
TED: I have written so many letters to Hasbro about that.
NORAH: Okay, I'm gonna give my chops a rest here and invite a friend of mine up to the stage. He's gonna sing a song to a very special lady in the audience who he loves very much. Let's give a big hand to John The crowd applauds dutifully as John walks out onstage. ANGLE ON Lori and Rex. Lori reacts, shocked.
LORI: Oh my god. John takes center stage, and looks down at Lori.
JOHN: Uh, hi. Um. This is for Lori Collins. Because I love her. This song always reminds me of the most important night of my life. The night we met. It's the theme song from the movie "Octopussy." The band begins playing. "All Time High". Inexplicably, Norah is playing the saxophone with a pair of shades on.
REX: ( fake voice, covering his mouth and looking away ) You suck, get off the stage! ( then, for Lori's benefit ) Hey, come on guys! The crowd starts to take the cue.
CROWD: Get off the stage! / Boooo! / You suck! / We wanna hear Norah! / Come on! ANGLE ON Ted in the wings.
TED: Ah, god.
JOHN: SO HOLD ON TIGHT / LET THE FLIGHT ANGLE ON a crazed audience member, who rushes the stage, racing toward John.
CRAZY GUY: You're an asshole! John flinches as he raises the mic stand off the floor at the last second, so the base is sticking out horizontally. The crazy guy runs right into it, bashing himself in the face. He goes down, unconscious and bleeding. Everyone gasps as the music stops.
NORAH: A few concert personnel rush out to check the guy.
STAGEHAND: Someone call an ambulance! The crowd is now shouting angrily at John. But he is only focused n one spot in the crowd. He sees that Lori and Rex are gone. Almost oblivious to the rest of the frenzy, he sighs, heartbroken. A couple of concert security personnel haul him offstage.
REX: That was insane. Did you see the way that guy's body hit the ground? It was like a rag doll!
LORI: Yeah, I'd rather just not talk about it.
REX: You want to go get a drink after this? I feel like I could use one after seeing a guy almost die.
LORI: Nope, I think I'd rather you just take me One drink, come on.
REX: One drink, come on.
LORI: Nope, not really feeling up to it.
REX: Alright, alright, I get it. I don't blame you. When you think about it, it was actually really unfair of him to embarrass you like that.
LORI: Just to be clear, I am not embarrassed. Listen, John and I may have our problems but at least he tried. You know what? I don't feel like talking to you about She walks away.
REX: Where you going?
LORI: Taking a cab. I'm going home. As she disappears out of earshot, Rex closes his eyes and releases a fart.
REX: EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN & LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SAME Lori gets out of the shower, and begins towelling off, still reeling with disgust from her encounter with Rex. After a few moments, there's a knock at the door. Lori sighs with annoyance, and walks to the door, still in her towel. She looks through the peephole, but there's no one there. She opens the door cautiously, and looks out into the hall. There's no one there.
LORI: ( pulling towel closer to her ) Ted? What're you doing here? What do you want?
TED: I need to talk to you.
LORI: Look, if you're here to fight John's battle for hi
TED: Lori, do me a favor and let me talk first, and then you can say whatever you There's a beat. She reluctantly considers.
TED: Look, John loves you very much. More than anything in the world. And he's fallin' to fuckin' pieces without you. He knows he screwed up big time, but you gotta believe me that is wasn't all his fault. If you'll just give him one more chance to be with you She rolls her eyes.
LORI: Ted. that's a very nice offer, but I don't want you to do that. This is about John and me and our problems. And I don't think it can be fixed.
TED: Because of me! Look, you want him to be a man. And I'm the one who's keepin' that from happening. As long as he's got his teddy bear, he's still a boy. And I care about him as much as you do. But I'm willing to give up the boy so you can have the man.
LORI: ( SIGH )
TED: Thank you. He's waitin' for me down at Charley's. So. maybe you could, y'know. go down instead of me?
LORI: What. now?
TED: Please. You'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't.
LORI: Alright, alright, I'll go.
TED: ( flipping on TV ) Hey, you mind if I stay and watch the The door shuts and she's gone. Ted gets up and walks into the kitchen. He opens the fridge.
DONNY: Hi, Ted.
TED: Donny throws a sack over Ted, trapping him.
JOHN: Lori! What what are you doing here?
LORI: You can thank Ted. A beat. John smiles slightly.
JOHN: Good, good. I've, uh. made myself a nice little home at the Midtown Hotel up the street. I'd show you around, but it's kinda classy. They require an undershirt and at least one visible cold sore for all customers.
LORI: ( LAUGHS HUMORLESSLY )
JOHN: Uh, yeah. She does. There's a beat. A busboy brings them each a So, work's good? Everything good there?
LORI: Yeah. Work's fine.
JOHN: How's Rex?
LORI: There is no Rex.
JOHN: Oh. Good.
LORI: ( a little taken aback ) Wow. Thank you. I appreciate that.
JOHN: Well. That's pretty much it. He takes out some money, and puts it on the table, paying the check. He smiles at her and walks out. She sits there for a beat.
TED: Yes, as you can see, you've been part of our family for quite some time. Welcome Heh, you know what's hilarious, I got tons of pictures of you guys at my house.

TED: I'm guessin' you guys don't have a PS3. I'm guessin' you're more of a wooden horse with a wig kinda family.
TED: Huh. Wig horse. Robert sits down on the floor, smiling at him. Donny stands in the doorway.
DONNY: Now, remember, Ted, you belong to Robert now. So you will do as he says.
TED: Y'know, you think you're just gonna get away with a kidnapping? Nice fuckin' example you're settin' for your kid.
DONNY: ( leaning in to Ted with
ANGER ): Ted flinches nervously. Donny moves back.
LANGUAGE!!!: Ted flinches nervously. Donny moves back.
TED: Maybe "no" to a Snickers bar every once in awhile wouldn't hurt.
ROBERT: Me and Ted are gonna be best friends, Yes. You are. Happy play time. Donny shuts the door. Robert stares at Ted.
DONNY: Yes. You are. Happy play time. Donny shuts the door. Robert stares at Ted.
TED: Jesus fucking Christ!
ROBERT: No! Daddy said no bad words!
TED: Yeah well, fuck your dad. Ted scrambles for the window and tries to open it. It doesn't budge. He takes a running leap at it, but just bounces off like a plush toy, and lands on the floor.
ROBERT: I said a bad word one time, and daddy punished me for it.
TED: That's a great story, I felt like I was Daddy gave me an ouch. Now I have to give you an ouch. Robert grabs Ted with one hand, and gets a grip on one of Ted's ears with the other hand. Robert pulls on the ear as hard as he can, and rips the ear off. Ted screams as loud as he can. Robert looks at him, holding the ear.

LORI: Listen, John. there's something I wanna say to you, too. He pauses, then gets into the car and sits down next to her. She prepares to speak, but John's phone rings. He shuts it off without looking at it.
JOHN: Go ahead.
LORI: John, I just want you to know that. I mean, I hope you don't think that John's phone rings. He looks down at it, annoyed. It reads "Unknown caller." He silences it.
JOHN: Whoever this is, it's not a good time.
TED: John! It's me! Can you hear me?
JOHN: Lori sighs, slightly annoyed.
TED: No, John! Don't hang up, I'm in trouble!
JOHN: What do you mean, what kinda trouble? Lori turns, slightly curious, but still annoyed.
TED: They got me! That freaky guy and his freaky fat kid!
JOHN: I'm in their house, John! You gotta call the police, they won't let me outta here! They tore my ear off!
TED: I'm in their house, John! You gotta call the police, they won't let me outta here! They tore my ear off!
JOHN: Wait, slow down! Where are you?
TED: Uh. I'm not sure, it's uh Suddenly, a hand grabs the phone away from Ted. He gasps and looks up. It's Donny, who slams the phone back down in its cradle.
DONNY: ( dark, brewing rage ) You're not a very polite guest.
TED: INT. LORI'S CAR - LATE DAY/DUSK
JOHN: ( INTO PHONE )
LORI: What's the matter, is he all right?
JOHN: I don't know.
LORI: Where is he?
JOHN: I don't know, but he's in trouble.
LORI: Why? What happened? Can you call him No, it's blocked wait a second. John scrambles for his wallet. He opens it, and pulls out the address given to him earlier by Donny at the Common. He looks at it, then points out the window.
JOHN: No, it's blocked wait a second. John scrambles for his wallet. He opens it, and pulls out the address given to him earlier by Donny at the Common. He looks at it, then points out the window.
DONNY: You've put us in a pickle here, haven't you? We have to go now.
TED: Yeah, good idea. Ted runs through Donny's legs, and out into the hall. He races for the living room and the exit, but Robert steps in front of the door, blocking him.
ROBERT: Found you. Robert turns the deadbolt on the door, locking it. Ted turns and bolts in the other direction back down the hallway, but sees Donny heading for him. Ted ducks into the dining room, as Donny lunges for him and misses.
TED: Donny and Robert move in to frame behind him.
AAAAAA!: Donny and Robert move in to frame behind him.
DONNY: We tried to make do with other teddy bears. But none of them were you, Ted. Ted whirls around in shock, as we cut to:
JOHN: It's this creepy fucked-up guy who wants Ted for his creepy fucked-up son. They got him somehow.
LORI: Which way?
JOHN: Shoot up 99!
JOHN: ( INTO PHONE )
DONNY: Robert, seat belt. Robert buckles up.
JOHN: ( TO LORI )
TED: Robert and Donny both hear this. Donny looks in his side- view mirror, just in time to see Lori's car swing a U- turn to pursue them. Donny speeds up, and races off up the street. Lori's car speeds up in pursuit.
JOHN: Come on, we're losing him! Lori speeds up.
JOHN: Get closer!
LORI: I'm trying!
TED: ( holding head in pain ) Aaaaa! Shit!!
ROBERT: No! You're being bad! Ted reaches down and grabs the crowbar with one arm, and brandishes it threateningly at Robert.
TED: Back off, Susan Boyle. Robert backs off in fear. Ted climbs out onto the rear of the car, and positions himself to make the jump. He tosses the crowbar away into the tunnel. John and Lori speed up, getting closer to him, so he can make the jump.
JOHN: I know.
LORI: I know.
JOHN: I know!
EASY: I know!
LORI: I know!
TED: Johnny! Total T.J. Hooker, right? John and Lori laugh.
JOHN: Yes! Fuckin' A right!
TED: God dammit! Ted gets his bearings, and notices the sack that Donny captured him in, lying on the floor. He looks up at Donny for a beat, then grabs the sack. ANGLE ON Donny driving. Suddenly, Ted jumps up from behind, and throws the sack over Donny's head, bracing himself against the back of the front seat. Donny yells in anger, and pulls at Ted, trying to get him off.
LORI: She pounds on the steering wheel, frantically willing the truck to get out of the way. Finally it does, and they continue on into the city.
NO!!: John and Lori turn just in time to see Robert charging at When Robert reaches John, John knocks him down with one punch to the face. Robert collapses. Lori and John look down at him.
LORI: Oh my god.
JOHN: Sorry, someone had to go Joan Crawford on that kid.
LORI: ( spotting the action on the

STAY THERE!!: He turns and runs back up the aisle, toward the concession area.
JOHN: Oh my God.
LORI: Oh my God.
TED: ( weak, slow breathing ) Ted looks glassy-eyed for a beat. John starts to frantically gather up the chunks of stuffing.
JOHN: Lori, get the stuffing! Get it all! Lori starts helping him, desperately grabbing chunks of the white cotton.
TED: John leans back over Ted.
JOHN: You're gonna be okay, buddy. you understand? You're gonna be fine.
TED: ( WEAK )
JOHN: No, look at me, buddy. I promise, you're gonna be okay.
TED: I. I don't think so. I'm. I'm in trouble. I need. I need to tell you What is it?

LORI: John. I don't know if this is gonna

LORI: John. I'm sorry. You did everything you could. I'm. I'm just so sorry. She gently puts an arm around him. There is a thunderclap outside. John does not react.
HEARD ): You're not afraid.

TED: You were pretty great out there at Fenway, Johnny.
LORI: Yeah, that's my big brave man.
JOHN: Oh my god, do you know how awesome it was punching a kid? I felt so powerful! I mean if that's what it's like to hit a woman, watch out, I liked it.
LORI: ( SMILING )
JOHN: I love you, too.

LORI: ( beat, she smiles ) That's all I ever wanted. John and Lori kiss as we pull away.
SAM JONES: I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. John and Lori kiss each other. They turn and wave to the cheering crowd. Ted waves happily to John, who waves back. John and Lori run down the aisle joyfully, passing pews full of people from the movie: Lori's co-workers, John's co-workers, ( Guy sitting with HIS BOYFRIEND, Alix and Tanya, etc. ).
TED: Y'know Sam, there's only one way to end a perfect day.
