BLACK: The thumping blade gets LOUDER AND LOUDER, the BASS LINE of "BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE" rising with it until finally.
MOTOWN: That's for Brooklyn, Muthafucka! Underneath the hovering chopper, OSIRIS,a black, buffed out Rambo-looking Sergeant, is letting loose his M-16 with abandon, yelling at the pilot to get the bird lower. It does. Fats grabs. the mortally wounded Brooklyn and slings him over his shoulder, Brooklyn's shirt is blown open revealing his entrails.in shock, he clutches his liver in his right hand, and is trying futilely to put it back in his body.
OSIRIS: FATS! GET YOUR ASS ON THIS CHOPPER NOW! LET'S MOVE! 4 41 FATS ignores him and continueb firing. MOTOWN comes running up to the chopper.

OSIRIS: FOUR LEAF IS DEAD MEAT, SOLDIER! AND YOU GOT ZERO 0' HUNDRED HOURS TO GET YOUR ASS ON THIS CHOPPER BEFORE YOU JOIN HIM! Osiris, standing on the skid, motions for the chopper pilot to take off.
BROOKLYN: A 1, I qft ( a soft whisper ) I Id .We PUSH IN ON BROOKLYN dramatically as he raises his head. Looking off to the tree line, he points a crooked It's him. It's Four Leaf. Everyone turns to-see. FOUR LEAF, who looks a lot like CHRIS MICHAEL SPEEDMAN from the "Scorcher" trailer, . burst through the treeline, half limping, half crawling heroically through the massive firefight in SLOW MOTION.

OSIRIS: GO! GO! Fats, still on the ground, in defiance of Osiris, grabs the chopper's runner, and in a superhuman show of strength, OR IS IT WEIGHT, holds it with-all-his might, preventing it from flying away. The pilot struggles with the controls, as Fats continues his barrage of bullets with his machine gun arm, providing weak cover for Four Leaf. The chopper is now gaining momentum, and pulls Fats about ten feet-off-the ground. He is, about to lose his battle with the helicopter. Four Leaf, riddled with bullets, and delirious, is fighting a losing battle to gain ground. He doesn't even have a gun.

OSIRIS: I HOPE YOU FAGGOTS LIKE HAMBURGER BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA BE BRINGING BACK TO THIS BIRD.. .COVER ME! Weak smiles flicker across the face of the men as they do just that. unleashing lead all around Osiris as he jumps out of the chopper like an Apache warrior. Fats drops off the runner of the chopper, shooting his machine gun in cool SLO MO. Screaming a war cry, Osiris makes a beeline for Four Leaf. Dancing between the raindrops, he dodges tracer fire . Osiris finally makes it and kneels beside Four Leaf, cradling his head. Four Leaf's eyes are glassy, and his body and arms are ripped open all over like a rag doll.
FOUR LEAF: Get outta here. I'm worm food, man, you ( beginning to cry ) What, and give up all that California pussy you been talking about? Shiiit. Someone's gotta show me around L.A.
OSIRIS: ( beginning to cry ) What, and give up all that California pussy you been talking about? Shiiit. Someone's gotta show me around L.A.
FOUR LEAF: ( cracking a bloody smile ) Shit. . .the only way you're gonna get a piece of LA pussy if is you go out to the graveyard and dig some up. Osiris looks down at Four Leaf's now missing arms.
OSIRIS: Well .y.you better come along and bring the shovel. He starts to choke up.
FOUR LEAF: I'm scared,. Sarge. 'Scared I ain't never gonna see another sunset. ( long philosophical beat ) Why does a man want to pick up sticks against another man. 'Stead of usin' them sticks. to prop a man up? Osiris nods, now crying like a baby. ï¿½4Id Iu I. Igft
OSIRIS': DON'T YOU DIE ON ME FOUR LEAF. .THAT'S AN FOUR LEAF ( beginning to fade ) Hold my hands. 'cause I got somethin' to say. Osiris looks down.at Four. Leaf's bloody, stringy stumps. There's nothing to hold.
ORDER!!!: FOUR LEAF ( beginning to fade ) Hold my hands. 'cause I got somethin' to say. Osiris looks down.at Four. Leaf's bloody, stringy stumps. There's nothing to hold.
FOUR LEAF: ( beginning to fade ) Hold my hands. 'cause I got somethin' to say. Osiris looks down.at Four. Leaf's bloody, stringy stumps. There's nothing to hold.
FOUR LEAF: Are, you holding them?
OSIRIS_: ( WEEPING ) Oh, I'm holding them..
FOUR LEAF: I ain't never been worth a. nothin' in this life, and it's kinda late to start b e i' a somethin' now. But you. you are my. b-b-brother. Four Leaf screws.up.his .face and begins to cryexcept that he can't. He tries again. and can't.. Hescrews up his face grotesquely.
FOUR LEAF: You are my. WE NOW PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are actually on location shooting this war scene with about 50 CREW MEMBERS watching, surrounded by millions of dollars worth of film Four Leaf, actually the superstar. playing him, Speedman, is getting increasingly self-conscious, becoming more and. more aware of the-crew waiting for him to cry. The actor playing Osiris, KIRK LAZARUS, is also getting uncomfortable holding Speedman's not-crying head.
SPEEDMAN: ( breaking character ) I'm sorry, can we cut, Damien? Damien grips his headphones in confusion, looking around to his cadre of assistants and ADs. The chopper continues to hover, soldiers continue to fight, except a few are starting to wonder what's going CUT! We gotta cut, Dorf!
SPEEDMAN: CUT! We gotta cut, Dorf!
DAMIEN: ( CONFUSED ) What? What did he say? ( to 1st AD ) Play it through! Still rolling! Now the extras have stopped fighting except for a few way far back.
1ST AD: Play it through! Still rolling!
SPEEDMAN: No! Not still rolling! Cut! Damien runs towards Speedman. Fats, who is young fat comedy gross-out star JEFF PORTNOY, gets up from the ground, rubbing his butt.
PORTNOY: OW, SHIT! I fell right on my ass bone! Other "dead" extras begin to hold their heads up and look around. Some are amputee stuntmen.
1ST AD: ( into megaphone ) Damien? Are we cutting? 1st AD jumps off the scaffold, running towards the director. Tekkies scurry around, lots of confusion. Are they cut, or what? Brooklyn,'.played by the not-famous KEVIN SANDUSKY,Ihold s his bloody "liver" up to hand off to someone.
DAMIEN: STILL ROLLING! Get down Kevin, you're Sandusky immediately complies, he seems to be the only actor listening to the director.
SPEEDMAN: I'm sorry.. I can't do it, Dorff. Damien runs up to Speedman. They are the center of attention the whole crew watching them.
DAMIEN: It's good, keep going. This is a big shot so keep going, let it come. No arms, you're hanging on, it's-al-1-coming out. It's real, death, life, brotherhood and we just. let's keep it going now. He starts to back out, turning his finger in the "still rolling" motion. He gives a thumbs up to the AD.
CODY: Is that the signal?
CODY: DAMIEN! IS THAT THE SIGNAL? BACK ON THE ACTORS 'IYd "' Damien has his hands full with Speedman.
SPEEDMAN: ( above the din of the
CHOPPER ): Dorf! Seriously, I think we should cut. I mean, Should Osiris be crying too? Maybe he shouldn't cry if I'm crying. Lazarus abruptly drops Speedman from his arms and gets up, shaking his head.
LAZARUS: I'm sorry, so, just keep crying or are'we No, no, it's good. Portnoy is walking around massaging his butt.
DAMIEN: No, no, it's good. Portnoy is walking around massaging his butt.
PORTNOY: Damien, I think I broke my ass. Is it possible to break your ass?
DAMIEN: Get back in character Portnoy! Still rolling everyone! ( to Lazarus ) Great crying Kirk stay with that. Chris Michael, don't worry about where Kirk is at, just be Four Leaf crying right here and now and still rolling. and GO!
CODY: Did he say "go"? ( loud into walkie )
DECIDE IF: BACK ON'THE ACTORS The 1st A.D. tries to.get Damien to pay attention to Cody, but he is too focused on getting Speedman to cry. I III I. 11h."
SPEEDMAN: Wait, hey, y'know, maybe- is it the line? "You are my brothers"? I don't think I would.say that. Four Leaf wouldn't say that.
DAMIEN: Yes, well-you see, Four Leaf was there and he did say that. So. Right. So let's just go.
SPEEDMAN: Is he here, or is he-'at the.hotel? Because I would love to run it by him.
1ST AD: Damien! The chopper! I got to let them go! We,need to pull the plug on the treeline burst if you're cutting!
LAZARUS: You know what, this is nuts. You got my take. I'm done. ( to Speedman ) Movie star. We'll be here till Chinese New Year waitin.' for my man to. cry.
DAMIEN: Kirk! Wait! Lazarus keeps walking.
DAMIEN: .You got my take.
LAZARUS: .You got my take.
,I: Tropic Thunder 13.
REDYKULOUS: Hey, can we get this going? I got peeps coming to my room to rub me down at 4. Bitches, too. His phone rings again.
REDYKULOUS: ( into phone ) Hey! What's up! Naw, nothing same soup, just re-heated, you know? Redykulous wanders off in another direction. The AD is now yelling into Damien's ear.
DAMIEN: ( losing it ) EVERYONE! Please! The chopper only has so much gas! PORTNOY, trying to lighten the mood, rips a huge FART.
PORTNOY: Plenty of gas right here, D-man! ( then feeling the pain in his
BUTT ): Hey, yo! I am trying to have a conversation here!
OWW1: Hey, yo! I am trying to have a conversation here!
REDYKULOUS: Hey, yo! I am trying to have a conversation here!
DAMIEN: Okay, fine! Fuck me! What the fuck do I know? I'm just the fucking. ( inarticulate snarl ) Damien throws his headphones off in frustration. and throws up his hands.
CODY: There's the signal! GO! GO! GO! Let's light this puppy up! Let's go freaking 11 TET here!! i Cody and his assistants push plungers, buttons, pull levers, and drag metal wands over long lines of wired nails, they spark and fizz.
WIDE SHOT': Damien is-still throwing his fit when.
ON CODY: climaxing with joy as he barks commands and pushes ever more buttons..
THE BLAST: blows the helicopter backwards into a bank of lights,' causing them to tip.and-begin a GIGANTIC CHAIN REACTION that takes down most of the equipment, then finally THE
CODY: ( 1 T ) That was good for me. Damien's mouth hangs open in shock. There is a strange quiet on the set.
DAMIEN: ( WHISPERING ) .Did we get that on film? The cameraman turns to the AD and then back to Damien, looking a bit scared.
CAMERAMAN: Sorry, Damien.'Chris Michael was saying to cut, so we cut The AD comes up to the lost looking Damien.
1ST AD: ( to Damien ) I'm gonna have to call it, Damien. Damien is silent, stunned.
1ST AD: ( into megaphone ) Okay, that's a wrap for'today. If you are !IN injured, please find the set medic. Speedman, looking as if he had nothing to do with what just happened, walks toward Damien.
SPEEDMAN: I think I got another in me if you want to go again, Damien. Damien looks at the scorched treeline behind them. Speedman looks too, then looks back at Damien.
SPEEDMAN: Your call. In the background, Cody is casually putting out a fire on his lap. He gives an 'I'm O.K.' gesture to no one in CUT TO: El TELEVISION OPENING GRAPHICS After a flashy montage, JULIE MORAN, the cute El News Daily reporter, walks through the Tropic Thunder set in a halter top, talking to camera:
JULIE: Well, it might look like 1969 here in the tiny Southeast Asian country of Bien Den Phu, but it is 2007, and they are making history. We are here with an E! exclusive, the first look behind the scenes at what Hollywood insiders are calling the most expensive war movie ever produced. It's called "Tropic Thunder", and first time Director Damien Dorfman has assembled an all-star cast to play the forgotten grunts who perished near here more than 35 years ago.
SPEEDMAN: ( as Simple Jack ) You mu-mu-muhhh make me'ha-aaaapy.
JULIE: ( to camera ) But now, the question is can Speedman "mu- mu-make" audiences happy in the true life story of war hero Four Leaf Tayback in "Tropic Thunder". And,' possibly a shot â 1. -4416 at that elusive gold statuette?
SPEEDMAN: ( very serious ) All I want is to make the real Four Leaf here proud. It's his story, he lived it and wrote it in his book. That's why we're here. But really, I mean, how cah we begin to understand what he what you went through? Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on the horizon for a beat. He lifts his hands up, and we see he has only two HOOKS. Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying to "get inside" him as much as possible.
FOUR LEAF: ( MYSTICAL ) When I lost these. ( holds his hooks up ) It was as if I saw through these for the first time..'. ( indicates his eyes ) And it was only then that I really began to use these. ( indicates his ears )
SPEEDMAN: That's great. He's like a. Buddha or something. Maybe I should rub his belly for luck! He laughs, but quickly realizes Four Leaf doesn't find it ,Tropic Thunder 18.
JULIE: ( to Speedman ) Like for a lucky Oscar nod this time? Maybe you should rub Kirk Lazarus's belly! He already has three! Speedman laughs uncomfortably, trying to seem unperturbed. i
L: CUT TO: A SERIES OF SHOTS OF KIRK LAZARUS In his normal.look, CAUCASIAN and IRISH, much like he was in the "Satan's Alley" trailer.
JULIE: . is famous for his total immersion into whatever role he plays. To.transform into the role of the African American Sergeant who saved_Four Leaf's life.
JULIE: After undergoing experimental pigmentation alteration procedures in a Singapore clinic, this was the startling Tropic Thunder 19. A doctor dversees as nurses carefully peel the bandages off Lazarus's head. Lazarus is now Black.
LAZARUS: ( OSIRIS VOICE ) There are all these young brothers who got no role models but a bunch of pimp- acting rappers, who glamorize a life of gangsterism and womanizing. I'm just grateful to have this opportunity to be able to represent. Redykulous hears this, looks pissed.
DAMIEN: My goal, quite simply, is for an audience member to walk out of the cinema, feeling as if they were IN Vietnam for two hours. Quite literally.
REPORTER: Are you intimidated about working with actors for the first time?
DAMIEN: ( CHALLENGING ) ( MORE ) Tropic Thunder 20. DAMIEN ( cont'd ) Not really, mate. I tell you what's intimidating. Filming a seven-foot Hutu warrior who is readylto shove his machete up your ass if you look at him cockeyed.
JULIE: And from the world of hip-hop, multi. platinum selling rapper, producer, and clothing designer Redykulous, and star of his own hi't reality show "Utterly INT. TROPIC THUNDER PRE-SHOOT PRESS CONFERENCE Redykulous is in his "REDYKWEAR" sweats.
REDYKULOUS: As far as Redykulous is concerned, you .know, I 'always believed you've got to exploit every opportunity. He holds up a can of "PYMP SWEAT".
REDYKULOUS: That's why my new sports drink Pymp Sweat is the official beverage on the set of Tropic Thunder, as well as my new energy bar, the "Bust-A-Nut", with all proceeds going to clean up land mines in this previously war ravaged area.
JULIE: At a reported budget north of $200 million, Tropic Thunder could end up costing almost as much as the real war! But the good news for Damien Dorfman and his troops the Oscar buzz is already starting! So for El News I'm Julie All of a sudden Portnoy, wearing a Tropic Thunder cap all askew and surfer shorts with no shirt, bursts out of the bushes. He screams wildly and GRABS Julie, who cracks up laughing at his "stunt". '
PORTNOY: ( silly voice ) Me so horny!! Me so horny!! He jumps into the pool with her! What a crack up!
DAMIEN: You can't do that Todd.
DAMIEN: Dailies are always bad! Bad dailies, good movie! Isn't that what they say?
DAMIEN: Well, yes, that's exactly-it,.Walter if- you actually came out here you would see that .these actors are
R: âº VOICE OF TODD ( cont'd ) I will not be called an eco-terrorist, do you understand that? Damien looks a bit bewildered by that. His hot young assistant comes in with a cell phone.
IN: âº VOICE OF TODD ( cont'd ) I will not be called an eco-terrorist, do you understand that? Damien looks a bit bewildered by that. His hot young assistant comes in with a cell phone.
DAMIEN: ( trying to seem calm ) Yes, Chris!?
SPEEDMAN: Hey, Dorf. Just wanted to call and throw a little pep talk your way. I know today was rough, and you're probably mad at yourself for not getting the shots, but that's the way these movies go. We all boot it from time to time, and today was just one of those days. Happens.
DAMIEN: ( sickly sweet ) Yes it does. It does. Though I do think you have to realize Chris, that you are somewhat responsi
SPEEDMAN: Oh, also needed to let you know, and I. .know you're like wrapped up with the movie, but I really need that new chef like we talked about, you know to really 4 get that super-ripped thing happening. This guy is great but all he makes are dumplings. And they stiill haven't worked out the TiVo thing. III I. I I 4I
DAMIEN': Right. well those things. those. 4,
SPEEDMAN: Yeah, of course, I just know we talked about getting super-super-ripped for that starvation sequence Speedman's other line goes. He sees the caller I.D.
SPEEDMAN: Oh,, shit can you hang on a sec, D? He switches over,, but it takes a few seconds with the CUT TO: INT. AGENCY OFFICE L.A. - DAY RICK PECK, head of the Peck Agency, sits in his office, overlooking. Los Angeles. He has a headset on.
SPEEDMAN: CUT TO: INT. AGENCY OFFICE L.A. - DAY RICK PECK, head of the Peck Agency, sits in his office, overlooking. Los Angeles. He has a headset on.
SPEEDMAN: I'm looking at your ugly mug on the back of Vanity Fair magazine in beautiful living color with the two cute cuddly pandas from cuteville. It's insane.
PECK: I'm looking at your ugly mug on the back of Vanity Fair magazine in beautiful living color with the two cute cuddly pandas from cuteville. It's insane.
I: Tropic Thunder 25. We see Pedk is holding a Vanity Fair with an ad on the back: it is a picture of Speedman looking earnest, holding two baby PANDAS. The caption reads:
PECK: The credibility factor that the pandas give you is priceless, and strangely, if' you see this picture, what really strikes me is the credibility that you give them. I've been getting psychotic feedback all day. Hey did you get the basket I sent? WE SEE: A survival-themed gift basket in a camouflage backpack, There's a satellite phone, camouflage sunblock, etc.
SPEEDMAN: Yeah. Thanks.
PECK: You sad? What's wrong?
SPEEDMAN: No I'm fine. I've just been having a tough time over here. They still havn't got the TiVo hooked up and. I don't know. Lazarus is getting all this Oscar buzz already
PECK: Is that what this is about? Crazy Kirk Lazarus goes and places his entire body in some experimental Malaysian dipping sauce so he can actually be black, of course he's gonna get buzz. Listen to what I am telling you. He is clinically mentally not right.
SPEEDMAN: Yeah but the way they talk about him. I mean, he played a retarded guy and won an Oscar, I play a retarded guy and don't even get a nomination. I don't know, I mean you said "Simple Jack" would be my "Elf" but with Oscars. Those were your exact words.
PECK: I don't believe those were my exact words but let's get beyond that to the root of this. Remember the moment you chose to do, this', and I wanted you to do the ESP robot thing with Wolfgang Petersen? And I said stay home be happy and you said "no, Rick I need to play a real human being" and I said "okay" and then I said "are you sure?" and you said that you needed this-for your soul?
SPEEDMAN: Yes but
PECK: Which I totally respected and now you're doing the crazy surfer three..sixty move on me,..which I love by the-way but-you said fuck it, I gotta do it for my soul And-that's why I hate you.. Because you were RIGHT. And you're in. the Phuc Long fucking Delta,. in the real mud, with- leeches in your hair, 20,000 mil es from Fatburger.being an actor-And, I would wager, forcing everyone around you to rise to your level. Am I right? I mean you are over there forcing a bunch of PUSSY actors to gel, straighten up and. become a platoon. And it hurts. Am I Speedman actually seems tohave bought-this
SPEEDMAN: Yeah. You are right.
PECK: Alright, that's what.I thought. Now get to work genius soldier. I'll handle the Peck hangs up abruptly.
ON SPEEDMAN: Speedman punches the button on his cordless and puts. it down. He ponders Rick's words as he gets caught up watching the end scene of "SIMPLE JACK" on his TV. He has forgotten Damien is on the other line.
DAMIEN: Chris? You there? Hello? Finally, after a few moments of listening to this, Damien explodes. He throws the phone on the ground and jumps up and down on it. He notices the crew staring at him. He tries to look as if that just didn't happen. He opens the sliding glass, and heads straight to the door. He continues walking through his office, out into the main offices. He motions for his assistant to join VOICE OF TODD Damien? This is not going to go away! I'm going to be on my cell all day I'm going to a funeral but I'm keeping it on. That's Where we're at with this!
DAMIEN: Get everyone together! We are having a cast meeting" tonight! No choice! Everyone must attend. I am putting my foot down!
DAMIEN,: Jeff. Jeff are you alright?.We.need to talk as.a cast, as a platoon, right ( sick and drunk ) Dorfie did you happenito see that grip withthe bandana?-The big guy?-I was supposed to meet him here. He has a- package of mine. Kevin Sandusky ( "Brooklyn" from the movie ) comes up to them, looking fresh faced and eager.
PORTNOY: ( sick and drunk ) Dorfie did you happenito see that grip withthe bandana?-The big guy?-I was supposed to meet him here. He has a- package of mine. Kevin Sandusky ( "Brooklyn" from the movie ) comes up to them, looking fresh faced and eager.
PORTNOY: ( BEAT ) Who are you?
SANDUSKY: I'm Kevin. Are you serious? Kevin Sandusky? I'm playing Brooklyn?
PORTNOY: Oh yeah. Right. Hey, have you seen that grip with the bandana?
SANDUSKY: Uh, no. I think But Portnoy is off already looking for his drug connection. They both watch him go.
SANDUSKY: Hey, Mr. Dorfman, I was hoping to find you. I know this is a party, but this afternoon after work I was breaking down my M-16, and I have to say, in the night watch scene, a minute and a half is a pretty short amount of time to assemble ( TOUCHED ) You actually care, don't you?
DAMIEN: ( TOUCHED ) You actually care, don't you?
SANDUSKY: Oh, yeah. Of course. This is a huge opportunity. To be working with all these great actors, and you.
DAMIEN: You're the only one who auditioned. You're the only one who did the two week boot camp, Sandusky.
SANDUSKY: Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird. Wasn't the point that we were all supposed to bond?
DAMIEN: ( BITTERLY ) Yes, that was the point. Damien, grabs a drink from a passing tray, and downs it. We follow A WAITER as he passes Speedman with a tray of Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a spring roll off the tray. He resumes talking to LAZARUS who is deeply uninterested.
I: r Tropic Thunder 30.
I: r Tropic Thunder 30.
SPEEDMAN: I guess I just watched some retarded people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time. with them. watching them.. Watching all the retarded stuff they did.
LAZARUS: Huh, I always found mere observation a little rudimentary. Gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional,paydirt. Diagram the source of the pain. Then live it.
SPEEDMAN: ( trying. to keep up ) Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the first time in-my life.. ( searches for the word ) Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer, retarded at home., Brushing my. teeth retarded. In a `weird way I had to unlearn what it was to be. .NOT Yeah. but Simple Jack thought he was smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was retarded. So you can afford to play retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there. Especially.knowing how the Academy is about that shit. Speedman is lost:
LAZARUS: Yeah. but Simple Jack thought he was smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was retarded. So you can afford to play retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there. Especially.knowing how the Academy is about that shit. Speedman is lost:
SPEEDMAN: About what?
LAZARUS: ( with 'a chuckle ) Are you serious? Everyone knows you don't ever go fully retarded!
SPEEDMAN: How do you mean? Lazarus sets his. drink down. School's in session.
LAZARUS: Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man. Looked retarded. Acted retarded. NOT retarded. He could count toothpicks, cheat at cards. Autistic. Sure. NOT retarded. HANKS'. Forest Gump. Slow? Yes.
LAZARUS: You went full retard, man. You never go 14 full retard. Don't believe me? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full retard. Went home empty handed. Speedman sees this for the truth it is. How could he be so stupid?
LAZARUS: ( cruelly, driving it home ) But hey, man! Who knows? Four Leaf could be your ticket to Oscar gold. I'd lose the hook hands though. cripples don't give the Academy wood either.
SPEEDMAN: ( DAZED ) Lazarus laughs and excuses himself by rattling his glass and heading for the bar. Speedman stands hurt, delicately holding the spring,roll in his hook.
DAMIEN: Redykulous. I need to talk to you.
REDYKULOUS: What up, money.
DAMIEN: ( in a hushed tone, aware of the cameras ) We're having a cast meeting, right now We need to come together as a unit The camera crew moves in for the close-up. . .making Damien uncomfortable . Redykulous takes it in stride. Throughout the scene he is TEXT MESSAGING someone.
REDYKULOUS: Damien is made uncomfortable by the cameraman who has i started manually zooming in and out on him in a dutch style camera move. DAMIEN i Do you mind if we step away for a moment?
REDYKULOUS: From what? Damien tries to indicate the crew.
DAMIEN: ( whispering even lower now ) From the.uh.you know. .this area..
DAMIEN: Oh. Hah! No, I mean away from the ( indicating the crew ) No. I can't do that. If Redykulous steps away from the cameras then my .people don't get to see the real Redykulous. The show is called "Utterly Well this is about work .my show so to. .speak. Do you understand?
REDYKULOUS: No. I can't do that. If Redykulous steps away from the cameras then my .people don't get to see the real Redykulous. The show is called "Utterly Well this is about work .my show so to. .speak. Do you understand?
DAMIEN: No. I can't do that. If Redykulous steps away from the cameras then my .people don't get to see the real Redykulous. The show is called "Utterly Well this is about work .my show so to. .speak. Do you understand?

DAMIEN: Well this is about work .my show so to. .speak. Do you understand?
REDYKULOUS: I guess. But not really. Your show and my show are the same thing. This is gonna help your show, trust me.
DAMIEN: Excuse me, everyone! If I could have your attention! Nothing. No one notices except Speedman. Damien grabs a couple bottles off the bar and BANGS them together.
DAMIEN: Sorry to break up the party, but I just wanted to call your attention to a cast meeting tonight! Big meeting! Future of the film depends on it!
DAMIEN: GODFUCKITI SHIT! Speedman comes up, placing a calming hook on Damien's shoulder. He steps to the fore.
GODFUCKITI SHIT!: Speedman comes up, placing a calming hook on Damien's shoulder. He steps to the fore.
SPEEDMAN: ( slowly, deliberately ) "When. we.'.. put. aside. our. differences. we see we're kind of the Within moments, the place settles completely.
SPEEDMAN: ( Long beat.-then almost quietly. ) "When we put aside our differences, we see we're kind of the same. Let's be friends, I know we will do great things ( beat, then more upbeat )
SPEEDMAN: I was looking-at it all backwards. You guys are lost. You heed.me to.lead you, to help you gel, and straighten.up like a PLATOON! A long beat.
PORTNOY: ( drunk out of his mind ) Hey,. Speedman! That bullshit pep'talk made me.H-h-h-h-h-happy! The entire party cuts.up.in loud hysterics. Speedman looks hurt. The DJ puts on-a Redykulous track really loud, and the, place gets even crazier.
FOUR LEAF: You don't know which way is up, do you private`? You couldn't find a dixie coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your prick. and showin' you the way. Damien doesn't know what the fuck that meant. Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes. Damien's eyes widen in fear.
,I: âTropic Thunder 35.
I: âTropic Thunder 35.
FOUR LEAF: A raindrop cannot carve a valley. An ant cannot defeat a buffalo. But a tempest can cleave that mountain to make the valley, and an army of ants can fell the mighty buffalo.
DAMIEN: ( seeing the wisdom of this ) FOUR LEAF If the lion, although king of the jungle, is thrown into the sea, he will drown. but.if.
FOUR LEAF: If the lion, although king of the jungle, is thrown into the sea, he will drown. but.if.
DO YOU!?: He lunges at Damien and grabs him by the collar with both hooks. '
DAMIEN: ( near tears now ) I want to!!! But not really!!
FOUR LEAF: I put my story in your limp Brit hands and you will not fail me!! ( long pause ) My boys were worse pussies than these guys. But the shit is what made us a unit. A whole. You must put them in the
FOUR LEAF: There's a place. About a hundred clicks from here, as the crow flies. Deep in the jungle. No trailers, no port-a-potties. Nothing but triple canopy jungle and cockroaches the size of melons. Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his Tropic Thunder 36.
DAMIEN: FOUR LEAF Rig up your documentary cameras'in that jungle, give me and Cody a few of those smoke bombs and some charges and we could light up the jungle so those lily-dick actors would think they were in the middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them thinking they're getting shot at, and you'll have your movie. Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as though he has been bitten. He holds out a small squished mosquito' between the claws of his prosthesis.

FOUR LEAF: You must put them.under your thumb the way this. bug is under mine. .under YOUR I see .yes .They would 'be under my total control. finally. I could shoot the whole movie there. Gritty. Dirty. Away from their pampered pussy posses and FOUR LEAF Yes. yes.
DAMIEN: I see .yes .They would 'be under my total control. finally. I could shoot the whole movie there. Gritty. Dirty. Away from their pampered pussy posses and FOUR LEAF Yes. yes.
FOUR LEAF: Yes. yes.
DAMIEN: Put them in the real shit. Film them with real fear in their eyes. REAL FEAR!
YES!!: Damien and Four Leaf share a crazed look. COOL MUSIC UP as WE PUSH IN and.
PORTNOY: ( FINALLY ) So, uh, any idea how long we'll be gone? Because I left most of my. vitamins back at the hotel. The other actors chime in with similar concerns, regarding sleeping arrangements, make up facilities, etc. '
FOUR LEAF: Save your breath, maggots! They all shrink back. Four Leaf's fierce posture is undercut as the helicopter lurches, sending Damien sprawling onto hire.
DAMIEN: That'sâ¢right. Maggots.
DAMIEN: Apparently they are not moving fast enough Four Leaf and Damien shove the guys out of the chopper onto the .Tropic Thunder 38.
GO!!!: Apparently they are not moving fast enough Four Leaf and Damien shove the guys out of the chopper onto the .Tropic Thunder 38.
FOUR LEAF: MOVE! MOVE! MOVE! The group, scared shitless, start falling out of the doors of the chopper, more like a bunch of oysters than a crack platoon. Four leaf jumps on the skid of thy chopper and motions to Cody, who lifts off. It kicksï¿½up a violent backwash, 0, Iq y forcing the guys to duck. and cover.
FOUR LEAF: See you in hell! As the noise of the helicopter fades, the group starts. trying to orient itself in their new surroundings.' The Jungle. Black, dense, unforgiving. All around them can be seen the remnants of a war that has been over for thirty years. A grave marker,. half of an old rusted outâ¢'downed chopper. All are absorbing the spookiness, except Portnoy who seems very upset.
PORTNOY: This is bullshit! Damien marches over to him, and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY in the face.
PORTNOY I: ( clutching his cheeks )
DAMIEN: YOU'RE SITTING ON A NEST OF HOSTILE V.C. ENEMY. CONGRATULATIONS FATS. YOU JUST GOT US ALL KILLED! ANYBODY ELSE CARE TO GIVE AWAY OUR POSITION TO CHARLIE!! CELL PHONES! Everyone hands over their phones. Speedman, however, turns away from the group, getting his. satellite phone out of the gift bag. He surreptitiously stows it down the front of his pants.
DAMIEN: CELL PHONES! Everyone hands over their phones. Speedman, however, turns away from the group, getting his. satellite phone out of the gift bag. He surreptitiously stows it down the front of his pants.

DAMIEN: Okay, girls. now that I have your attention, I will tell you fuckfaces what we're doing here. You are no longer actors in a movie. You,are grunts in a war. These men around you are your The guys look at each other, unhappy.
DAMIEN: Congratulations. You've just landed in "the shit". Your objective is to head north and liberate the village at D'ang Kwook Hill, at which point "Four Leaf" gets himself captured, at which point you rescue him, at which point we will chopper you home. We will also be rigging this entire valley of death with hidden cameras so that every glorious moment gets on film. And believe me it WILL be glorious. If it looks real, chances are good it probably is. You wanted to be actors? You wanted to occupy the skin of another human being? Get ready to occupy the skin of a terrified U.S. Infantry grunt, surrounded by death, crawling up Satan's arsehole. There's going to be enemy fire. Booby traps. Your own personal little slice of the 'Nam. The group shares a look "What's going on?" He pulls out a laminated packet.
DAMIEN: ( to Spe?dman ) "Four Leaf", since you're the Captain here, here's the scene list and the map. ( he throws them at him ) Think you can handle it? From now on, Whatever we get on film is our movie, Damien pulls out a walkie-talkie.
DAMIEN: THIS is your only link to, the real world. It will be used only in an emergency or to replenish our supplies if absolutely necessary. This is NOT a cell phone. This radio goes'to the chopper, and the chopper ONLY. The chopper is GOD, and I am Jesus Christ his SONI!! You will' depend on and pray 'to US!! And nobody ï¿½iï¿½ï¿½ i n I' ï¿½IMdï¿½4 gets home until we get the shots! ( loud and confident ) Now. let's'put the greatest war movie ever in the can! With that, Damien marches toward the treeline and'steps on a dormant LAND MINE left sleeping for decades., BLOWING'
SPEEDMAN: EXT. JUNGLE. A HALF MILE AWAY A group of about SIX ASIAN GUERILLA FIGHTERS, well armed and scary looking,,. notice the sound of the explosion. They begin talking very seriously in a foreign language. One of them grabs a radio:
GUERILLAS: ( SUBTITLES ) A UNKNOWN VOICE ( crackling over walkie talkie ),
I: Tropic Thunder 41.
CODY: So, I'm thinkin' as soon as Damien gives us the go ahead, we'ï¿½ust their cherry with a few airbursts, then alpha-alpha till they come running right at, us, then a good of fashioned firefight, maintaining our distance. Four Leaf ignores him, instead looking around the jungle, looking almost lost.
CODY: I been meaning to tell ya the whole shoot. I'm probably one-a your biggest fans. Your book was kinda my "Catcher in the Rye". It inspired me to become a gyro Four Leaf gives Cody nothing except his usual stoic I'm actually sort of a war nut. I mean I never was in the service, but for me blowing shit up in a war films is sort of my way of paying tribute to the real deal. And you sir, are the real deal. Hey, I was wonderin' what kind of sidearm you carry? Looks to me like a
CODY: I'm actually sort of a war nut. I mean I never was in the service, but for me blowing shit up in a war films is sort of my way of paying tribute to the real deal. And you sir, are the real deal. Hey, I was wonderin' what kind of sidearm you carry? Looks to me like a
CODY: Hey, I was wonderin' what kind of sidearm you carry? Looks to me like a
FOUR LEAF: ( very scary ) I don't know what it's called. I just know the sound it makes when it takes a man's life. Cody, a little spooked, picks up his radio.
CODY: Ok, we're ready to rock and roll. ( to walkie-talkie ) Damien, come in. Cameras are up, ordinance are up. Ready to kick the tires and light the fires on your say so.
PORTNOY: I think he's like. dead.
REDYKULOUS: I don't think he's hiding.. I think he just died! Sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse. pulls a wrist into frame.
SANDUSKY: He doesn't. have a pulse .or a head. He then grabs a bent and rusty.piece of metal.
SANDUSKY: Must've been one of those Claymore mines. This old Jungle must.be full of them.,
REDYKUZOUS: You bet your ass it is. That's why a percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are helpin' solve the problem! Damien's corpse emits a disturbing death rattle. Speedman busts up laughing. They turn to him what the Speedman throws an-arm.around Sandusky, -like an indulgent older brother.
SPEEDMAN: C'mon! Don't you get it? This is what .Dorf was talking about our slice of the Nam! He's trying to get in our Tropic Thunder 43.
SPEEDMAN: That whole "life and death" speech in the chopper? He's meshing 'with us! What do you think all that "playing God" was The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief except Lazarus.
LAZARUS: Are you nuts, shithead? The dude is Sandusky looks unsure. He doesn't want to take sides.
SPEEDMAN: Kirk. I know you're the big fancy actor here, but, no offense, I've done a lot mote effects driven event films, and I think I can spot a prop body.
DAMIE: The walkie crackles unintelligibly. Speedman picks it up, showing it to the guys. See?
SPEEDMAN: ( SMIRKING ) Alright, can we start the scene now? Or do you need a formal invitation?! ( checking the list ) Scene 12A, ext. Jungle. Day. Ambush.
SPEEDMAN: ( as Four Leaf ) I got a baaaad feeling on this one, Fats. The group remains motionless., Speedman gives Portnoy a ,M in MAIM "c'mon!" type look. Portnoy doesn't know what he means.
SPEEDMAN: I said, I got a baaad feeling on this one, Brooklyn. Oh! He's acting! Sandusky hesitantly takes the cue, and starts walking. stealthily around.with him, on high.alert.for Charlie. Swinging his gun unpredictably.
SANDUSKY: ( -as Brooklyn ) Me too, cap'n.
SPEEDMAN: Naw, man. I know you ain't crazy Well,. if I told you that I, I never actually, well, been with a girl.you wouldn't, like, think I was, like, queer .or nothin'. would you.?
SANDUSKY: Well,. if I told you that I, I never actually, well, been with a girl.you wouldn't, like, think I was, like, queer .or nothin'. would you.?
SPEEDMAN: .Naw, man. I wouldn't think you was a
,I: Tropic Thunder 45.
REDYKULOUS: ( acting really "black guy"
SCARED ): Sh.sh.shit .When I get back to the world, I'm gonna find me the finest piece of Detroit nubian mugambo, and fuck it till I broke its back.
PORTNOY: The last "mugambo" you ever tasted was in your momma's soup bowl. I wouldn't mind slurpin' on a little of that
SPEEDMAN: That's enough outta you Fats. Don't you worry, Brooklyn. You gotta lotta days a fucking ahead of you and I for one ain't gonna let Charlie. Lazarus can't handle it anymore.
LAZARUS: What the FUCK is wrong with you people?! Speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back. He addresses the treeline.
SPEEDMAN: Sorry Damien! Back to one. action! ( he gets back in character ) Don't you worry, Brooklyn, You gotta
LOTTA: Yo, asshole! Mothafucka just DIED! Speedman sighs, annoyed.
LAZARUS: Yo, asshole! Mothafucka just DIED! Speedman sighs, annoyed.
SPEEDMAN: How many more takes you wanna wreck? Some of us are taking this seriously. Lazarus looks likes he wants to explode. But instead he becomes eerily calm. He begins an impressive transformation Everything except for his skin color returns to his real identity, a pompous Irish prick.
LAZARUS: ( Heavy Irish ) Jaysus! There isn't going to be any movie, ya gobshite!
PORTNOY: ( re: Lazarus transformation ) i Wow. That was really cool.
THE GUERILLAS: Are watching this, poised to attack.
SPEEDMAN: Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped He mimes picking something , off, the ground.
SPEEDMAN: It's called your character. Don't worry, I won't tell the Academy! Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The Guerrillas have seized the moment. The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and debris kicks up all around him.
SPEEDMAN: You happy now? We're out of position for the effect! Am I the only one who read .the script?! This is the ambush! A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks of wood and shrapnel everywhere.
SANDUSKY: I think they're really shooting at us!
SPEEDMAN: What are you guys worried about? These guys are pros. The unions would tear them a new ass-if any of us got hurt. The actors stay down, looking scared.
SPEEDMAN: Come on, you guys! Let's use this!
GUERILLA LEADER: The guerillas hastily go through their packs hooking up EXT. JUNGLE - HILLTOP CLEARING Four Leaf looks out into the jungle below, he can hear the firefight, but, Cody can't.
FOUR LEAF: Hear that? Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives.
CODY: What? I still can't get Damien on the radio. I bet he forgot how to use the Walkie again. What do you say we get a little. pro-active? Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger.
I: t' Tropic Thunder 48.
ON CODY: He pushes down the plunger.
CODY: Right on!! I bet Damien heard that!. Cody turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring straight at 10 GUERILLA FIGHTERS with their submachine guns pointed straight at them.
CODY: Oh shit.
FOUR LEAF: Oh yeah. And with that Cody and Four Leaf are.RIFLE BUTTED out of EXT. JUNGLE THE ACTORS Speedman motions for everyone to "cease fire".
SPEEDMAN: ( PUMPED ) Aaaaand. CUT! Jesus!. Alright! That's the trailer 'right there!
REDYKULOUS: That was some sick shit! I wasn't even thinking bout the camera! The guys' adrenaline is flowing, they do high fives all around. Lazarus is not happy. He looks off into the jungle, sensing that someone was out there.
SANDUSKY': So what do we do now? Speedman pulls out the map, frowns at it.
SPEEDMAN: Damien said to head north. I'm guessing they've got more of these "battles" and Viet Congs rigged for uls on the way. ( into it ) Alright, let's hump-our shit to D'ang Kwook! Let's didi double time! We got a lot of clicks to cover! Speedman heads off into a particularly dense section of jungle. After a beat, he reappears, looking a little Uh.Sir, isn't it that way? Kevin points in the other direction. Speedman glances down at the map, which he rotates around, right side up Oh yeah. Thanks, uh.
SANDUSKY: Uh.Sir, isn't it that way? Kevin points in the other direction. Speedman glances down at the map, which he rotates around, right side up Oh yeah. Thanks, uh.
SPEEDMAN: Oh yeah. Thanks, uh.
SANDUSKY: ( can't believe it ) Kevin. Kevin Sandusky.
SPEEDMAN: Right. Okay, To D'ang Kwook! Lets do-it- Everyone follows Speedman. Lazarus, very reluctantly, brings up the rear, still looking off into the jungle. A
BYONG: The Unseen Leader shakes. his head.
UNSEEN LEADER: UNSEEN LEADER. EXT. BAMBOO FOREST DAY The actors are slogging along, through a tall thicket of bamboo. They look exhausted except for Speedman, who always manages to look like.a.movie star.
BYONG: UNSEEN LEADER. EXT. BAMBOO FOREST DAY The actors are slogging along, through a tall thicket of bamboo. They look exhausted except for Speedman, who always manages to look like.a.movie star.
PORTNOY: So. we're just supposed to keep We'll see some action soon enough. And try to stay in character. We're on What do you mean "soon"?
SPEEDMAN: We'll see some action soon enough. And try to stay in character. We're on What do you mean "soon"?
PORTNOY: What do you mean "soon"?
,I: Tropic Thunder 51.
SPEEDMAN: Whenever Damien decides it's time, I When's that?
PORTNOY: When's that?
SPEEDMAN: I don't know. That's the whole point. Damien wants us tired and confused.
REDYKULOUS: Yeah, well I'm definitely qualifying for those objectives. Everyone chimes in they all need a break. Lazarus notices the mutinous vibe and smiles.
SPEEDMAN: Fine, fine. Okay, let's take a break, but be on the lookout for anything. Charlie doesn't care if you're on a break or not. Speedman plunks down and opens the map. He seems puzzled. Lazarus eyes him suspiciously. Sandusky walks off to take a leak. Lazarus then watches him go. Off to the side, Sandusky starts to pee. He hears something rustle next to him.
LAZARUS: Speedman is watching. I don't have much time. I don't really need to piss. I need to talk to you. You went to the boot camp Sandusky, right? You can read that map?
SANDUSKY: Good, good. Speedman is a tosser. That hoor's melt really thinks this is a movie. And he's got the lot of ya Tropic Thunder 52.
LAZARUS: Good, good. Speedman is a tosser. That hoor's melt really thinks this is a movie. And he's got the lot of ya Tropic Thunder 52.
SANDUSKY: You saying you don'tithink they're filming us?
I: Of course not! It's only a matter of time before he walks us into more mines or more of whoever the hell was shootin', at us. That muppet's going to get us all killed. I need to convince everyone.to turn around, but I .can't do it without the map. You're the only one who can read it. Can I count on you?
LAZARUS: Of course not! It's only a matter of time before he walks us into more mines or more of whoever the hell was shootin', at us. That muppet's going to get us all killed. I need to convince everyone.to turn around, but I .can't do it without the map. You're the only one who can read it. Can I count on you?
SANDUSKY: Well, yeah, I.guess. But
LAZARUS: Good man, Good man. Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing, shaking, etc.., and heads back to the group. Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to? Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to see Speedman, right next to him.
SPEEDMAN: I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you. Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create a red pee.stream.
SPEEDMAN: Lazarus is insane. He's freaking out, and. he's gonna.ruin the whole movie for all of us. The men respect you, because you went to boot camp and rehearsal. ( patting his shoulder ) And you're pretty handy with that map. I need you on my side, Kyle.
SANDUSKY: Tropic Thunder 53.
SANDUSKY: Well, I
SPEEDMAN: Good man. Good man. Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look.
SPEEDMAN: If we stay on this trajectory we should be reaching the village any minute now. At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating from Portnoy.
SPEEDMAN: Buck up,, Fats .we got a long road ahead of us.
PORTNOY: ( SICK ) No. its just that I don't feel so hot. I left my medication at the hotel.
REDYKULOUS: ( to himself, snickering ) Yeah, I'd like to check out some of those "meds" for my own self. Lazarus moves up to Speedman.
LAZARUS: Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a village don't you think we would have hit it by now?
SPEEDMAN: Quit your carping, we're right where we're supposed to be!
LAZARUS: .( laughing ) Hey, Is there a feckin' river on that S.pee`dman refers to the'now sopping wet map.
SPEEDMAN: Yes! There is! Its just a little more' down to the. lefty-down part from the: ( checking the scene list ) Anyway,. this feels like the Sampan, Boat Raid at the end of the second act.
LAZARUS: I don't see a "Sampan" boat!
SPEEDMAN: Any second now one should come by. Alright men, into the water! Everyone'except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water. They all hold their rifles above their heads.
LAZARUS I: - L-et-'-s-stop this-char-ade-,sha-l-l-we? We need to quit faffin' about and turn. around NOW! And. Lazarus grabs Sandusky.
LAZARUS: Sandusky agrees. with me. Don't you, Kevin is caught, not sure what to d
SPEEDMAN: Wait! First of all. Now Speedman grabs him.
SPEEDMAN: Kelvin believes in this movie. And, second, need I remind you,. I am your superior officer.
LAZARUS: No, yer an actor. Arid if memory serves, a pretty shite one. The actors react Damn! Oh Snap! Shit! Speedman steels' THAT'S THE WAY OUT! That's our only Yeah, but maybe we should stay here until they send help! Or maybe try to get back to the hotel.
SPEEDMAN: THAT'S THE WAY OUT! That's our only Yeah, but maybe we should stay here until they send help! Or maybe try to get back to the hotel.
PORTNOY: Yeah, but maybe we should stay here until they send help! Or maybe try to get back to the hotel.
SPEEDMAN: Help from where! Need I remind you that Damien's orders were to ( right at Lazarus ) stay in character. ( to the guys ) Now, I already have an international box office presence, but for some of you, I'm guessing you might not want to screw this movie up! This actually seems to affect the actors. Lazarus can't believe it.
SPEEDMAN: .okay.C'mon, boys! This way. Let's go get those Viet Congs! Lazarus throws down his gun. He's had it.
LAZARUS: Jay-sus Fuck! It's Viet Cona! Not Viet Congs! Viet Cong, you plunker! And, hey, if you're so sure of yourself, why don't you let Kelvin have a look at the map?! Kevin doesn't know what to do he doesn't want to get in the middle of this. Speedman continues to be the tough Be my guest. Speedman hands over the soggy map. Kevin looks. After a long beat.
SPEEDMAN: Be my guest. Speedman hands over the soggy map. Kevin looks. After a long beat.
SANDUSKY: We've been going the wrong way. 'We were supposed to be doing this: Sandusky traces his finger along the correct route a clearly marked, northward arrow.
SANDUSKY: instead, we did this. i I ï¿½1d Iv I. 11M% Sandusky draws a line due East ..into a. section of the. map clearly marked with scary skull and cross-bone type 14 % ( holding his stomach ) Oh, man, this is not' cool, this is not cool at all. Speedman grabs the map back from Sandusky.
PORTNOY: ( holding his stomach ) Oh, man, this is not' cool, this is not cool at all. Speedman grabs the map back from Sandusky.
SPEEDMAN: I can't believe you people!. You're pussing out on me? We are supposed to be a unit!
LAZARUS: No one is "pussing out." They just prefer not. to die.out here. Sandusky, can you get'us back to the landing zone without the map?
SANDUSKY: It might be tricky, but maybe.
LAZARUS: Okay, which is it, gentlemen? Playin' war with Mister Box Office? Or staying Unbelievable!. Are you guys really gonna abandon this movie? A long tense. beat finally, Sandusky walks towards Lazarus. Everyone follows him. Speedman looks stunned. After a moment, he shakes his head and begins crossing the river, holding his rifle with both hands over his head.
SPEEDMAN: Unbelievable!. Are you guys really gonna abandon this movie? A long tense. beat finally, Sandusky walks towards Lazarus. Everyone follows him. Speedman looks stunned. After a moment, he shakes his head and begins crossing the river, holding his rifle with both hands over his head.
SPEEDMAN: So that's the way it,,is, huh? Fine! I'll finish the movie alone! ( turns to Lazarus, under his
BREATH ): And when I give my acceptance speech, I'll be sure to thank you, Lazarus, for staying out of that scene. And come Oscar night, we'll see who feels a little "full He reaches the other side of the river.
SANDUSKY: Chris, You have no idea where you're Yeah, I do! ( consulting the scene list ) I'm going to "EX'S. JUNGLE. DUSK. FOUR LEAF PINNED DOWN AND ALONE". And, I can shoot it alone. They'watch him trudge into the foliage. U2'S "BULLET THE BLUE SKY" comes up as the men watch Speedman disappear.
SPEEDMAN: Yeah, I do! ( consulting the scene list ) I'm going to "EX'S. JUNGLE. DUSK. FOUR LEAF PINNED DOWN AND ALONE". And, I can shoot it alone. They'watch him trudge into the foliage. U2'S "BULLET THE BLUE SKY" comes up as the men watch Speedman disappear.
CLOSER: Speedman walks through the scary jungle, exhausted. He is tired, lonely and hungry. The jungle is making all sorts of terrifying noises. Finally he stops and regards the DORF!.CODY?!.What's the deal with a meal break? Are they gonna chopper stuff in later on? I don't wanna be a prima donna or anything, but, we gotta eat, ( PAUSE ) P- 'Tropic Thunder 58. Clearly no answer. He trudges a bit further finally 'plunking down.by the trunk of a huge tree. , He empties his pack, within which is the gift bag.from his.agent. He 'surveys his wares: An i-pod. Nano, an In Style magazine, a neck pillow, Cherry Chapstick, a, tonightshow baseball hat, some packets of equal, and an unopened "MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS' DVD.

PORTNOY: ( after a beat ) Ohhh GOD! Is'anybody BOILING!? It's like a sweat lodge out here!
LAZARUS: Make a note gentlemen,. unwittingly, Jeffrey Portnoy is joining the proud ranks of those of us who have suffered for art. ( to Portnoy ) A new frontier for you, Funny Man. When this is all over, you might have more than flatulence to offer an audience. Portnoy looks a little hurt.
REDYKULOUS: You know what? I think I actually liked you better when you were a nigga.
LAZARUS: You know, Redykulous', I respect what it is you do, the rapping, the rhyme-talking invented by the Irish I might add.
REDYKULOUS: "Why"?! I dunno.maybe because they had one good part for a black man in this movie and they gave it to a white guy.
LAZARUS: Oh.I see.Put another way you're mad because I can act "black" better than you can.
SANDUSKY: Take it easy guys.
REDYKULOUS: ( to Sandusky ) You better rein in 'black like me' over here, before I put a foot in his white Niggaz always got to be niggaz. This is truly over the line. Redykulous lunges at Lazarus. They fight. Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw. Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart.
LAZARUS: Niggaz always got to be niggaz. This is truly over the line. Redykulous lunges at Lazarus. They fight. Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw. Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart.
SANDUSKY: Okay! That's enough! Jesus Christ! It's not enough we have people shooting at us! Now we have to kill each other?! Let's pull it together! This place is full of land mines! Or doesn't anyone's sense memory recall our director being blown up by onel? That shut them up.
LAZARUS: Sandusky is right. we could all learn a little from his common sense approach. From now on we walk Indian style, footstep upon footstep. Sandusky. . .you take first position. He breaks off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and pushes him out front. Sandusky gives him a look.
LAZARUS: Your bravery shames us. Sandusky reluctantly starts down the path, tapping for land mines with the branch. The guys follow at a VERY safe distance. EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT AM l u I, I nhy CLOSE. ON Speedman's face. After a beat.a drop of water hits him in the.forehead. Then another. PULL BACK to reveal a pathetic shelter made. out of headphone. wire, and the In Style magazine.' The drip-is now becoming full on RAIN. He clutches an Equal packet and. the Cherry Chapstick. Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh. He then tears open the Equal packet and empties its contents into his hand,.and takes. a lick, savoring every granule. He hears a rustling in the bushes across from him. A rodent? Food? Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and begins to stalk his prey. Now another movement behind.the bush, and a flash of. Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness, and knife drawn, he lunges onto the bush, A HUGE ROAR is QUICK SHOTS OF: FANGS, BLOOD, AN EYEBALL, A HUGE PAW. Speedman is slashed, SOMETHING has got him in a choke He reels around screaming.and stabbing wildly, brutally pummeling his attacker. He is. covered in blood, but looks ecstatic.
SPEEDMAN: Die! Die, you son of a bitch! Die! Speedman deals a death blow. And unleashes a primal VICTORY SCREAM. Spent, he finally gets a good look at his victim: A.small, cute, cuddly PANDA. Speedman looks horrified.
I" 1: FLASH on a SERIES OF STILLS from SPEEDMAN'S PANDA PHOTO
RICK: I got the personal attache of Bien Den Phu's ambassador to the United Nations of America delivering a TiVo directly to your bedroom. But the bad news is you gotta sit down and have monkey brains with him or some ceremonial shit for the local paper.

SANDUSKY: I think he's dead. A wet fart seeps out of Portnoy.
REDYKULOUS: No. Just smells like hens dead. Smelled
44M: like that all night.
LAZARUS: What's wrong with him?
PORTNOY: ( LYING ) Nothing! Probably just the beginning stages of some . . kinda.jungle fever. More bad noises.
PORTNOY: If we can work out some rig to carry mï¿½? I think it might subside in a little bit. No one touches him.
LAZARUS: Alright. Sandusky? Sandusky looks up at him. Is he serious?
SANDUSKY: You and Redykulous are gonna have to carry Portnoy. God help you. He marches off.
LAZARUS: You and Redykulous are gonna have to carry Portnoy. God help you. He marches off.
SANDUSKY: God help me?
REDYKULOUS: God help him that bitch ever find his blackface minstrel show ass alone with me in the real world. Redykulous and Sandusky shake their heads and gather up Portnoy on a make shift stretcher.
REDYKULOUS: From behind, Sandusky grabs him and forces him to the SHH! Everybody down! The guys hit the dirt. Lazarus crawls up to join them. He pulls out his binoculars, and surveys the scene.

LAZARUS: How do you know all,this?
SANDUSKY: It was a long trip. I read the in-flight magazine. We're in the Golden Triangle, the biggest drug producer in the world.

LAZARUS: Sweet Mother of Jaysus. Suddenly: GUNFIRE ERUPTS ALL AROUND! A BAND OF GUERILLAS have spotted them and are running at them, firing automatic weapons. The guys scream, and start a frantic retreat down the hill. Portnoy suddenly gets well enough to run out of his stretcher for dear life. In fact, he is actually beating them down the hill.. .when suddenly WHUMP! He falls into a PIT!
PORTNOY: HELP! GUYS! WAIT! REDYKULOUS stops and turns around and runs back to him, heroically pulling him out. BUT.
PORTNOY: Ow! Fuck Dude! What the fuck?! He screams in pain! Finally, WHUMP!! He disappears into the'hole. REDYKULOUS whistles for the guys to join him, and they all pile into the hole.
HOLE: Footsteps can be heard above leaving the area. Sandusky lights a match. Portnoy is weeping in pain.
SANDUSKY: Must be one of those underground tunnels. The-cou-ntr-y-is-l-itte-red-with them. Je-f-f must have found one of the entrances,:. Portnoy is on his side in pain, whimpering.
PORTNOY: My ass.I think I took one in the ass.
SANDUSKY: Lemme see. Sandusky rolls him.over, and off camera, helps him remove his pants. All the guys recoil in horror.
REDYKULOUS: AWW JEEESUS MAN! How did it get infected so fast? More ad libs of disgust.
SANDUSKY: How did it get infected so fast? More ad libs of disgust.
SANDUSKY': Okay Jeff.This is gonna hurt like hell, but I have to take my finger and see how deep the slug is, and if I can dig it out. Take a breath. Redykulous, hold his Beat. Sandusky puts his hand off camera.
I: Hey Dude! What are you doing! Cut it out! That's not the bullet hole. The bullet hole is over here! It dawns on the guys that they have NOT been looking at the bullet hole. Ad-libs of even MORE disgust.

TRAN: We do not have many luxury here. Simple Jack is the only movie we possess. We have watched it many, many times. How is the word? Genius? Speedman smiles big. They smile back at him. It's a small world after all.
BODYGUARD: ( broken English ) You should have got Oscar.

SANDUSKY: It looks clear, but I can't be sure. I say we stay in here till it's dark.
REDYKULOUS: I can't believe this is how it ends for Redykulous. I'm a triple platinum recording artist., Shit.
PORTNOY: ( shivering and wheezing ) I gotta get back to the hotel. I'm not gonna make.it.
SANDUSKY: Forget it. That guard patrol knows we're out'here. They'll be looking for us. Anyway, Speedman's in that compound. And no one else knows but us.
LAZARUS: That's right. So here's the plan. Everyone leans forward expectantly.
LAZARUS: We sneak out of here, make our way back to the hotel and once we're safe, we alert the government of Speedman's Sounds good.
REDYKULOUS: Sounds good.
SANDUSKY: Whoa whoa whoa . . wait! So, we're just gonna leave him here?
REDYKULOUS: Yeah, and I don't wanna spend another minute getting the full on smell'o vision in this hole with his stinky ass. Everyone agrees. They start packing up. Sandusky looks SANDUSKY Au II4 WAIT! Look, I don't think I've met a more wildly self involved human than Speedman, but you're just gonna leave him here? I mean, come on. He's a person, guys. These drug lords are killers. I mean, they eat their enemies. We leave him alone now, he doesn't have a chance in That tosser is in there because of his own stupidity. As far as I'm concerned, he brought it on himself.
LAZARUS,: That tosser is in there because of his own stupidity. As far as I'm concerned, he brought it on himself.
REDYKULOUS: Besides, how could we possibly rescue him? Get real, Sandusky, we don't know what the fuck we doing out here.
SANDUSKY: We've gotten this far. Look, we're making a movie about one of the greatest rescues ever. It's a true story,, right? I mean, those guys weren't superheroes! They were just put in extra-ordinary circumstances, and they rose to the Yeah, but they were trained soldiers. They knew how to take care of themselves.
PORTNOY: Yeah, but they were trained soldiers. They knew how to take care of themselves.
SANDUSKY: And we don't? They believed they could do it. They believed in each other. Look, I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
REDYKULOUS: You mean, like, not on the same flight? Sandusky just looks at them. They know that is not what he meant.
PORTNOY: I NEED MY DRUGS! Jeff I know this is really hard for you,.â¢but you're gonna have to kick some time, and it might as well be now. ( he turns to Lazarus ) Kirk, I've always admired you as an actor. But as a person, I have to say, not that impressive.' You got a.few Oscars. Got any balls? Lazarus takes this in.
SANDUSKY: Jeff I know this is really hard for you,.â¢but you're gonna have to kick some time, and it might as well be now. ( he turns to Lazarus ) Kirk, I've always admired you as an actor.

SANDUSKY: Redyk. Whadda.you say? You talk a good game, but how's it gonna feel when you're sipping Cristalle with your homies.in the hot tub back in.Cali knowing you left.a man to die back here? You gonna rhyme about that? , There is a long beat.
REDYKULOUS: Shit. I only wish they was filming this for my show. I'm in. He looks to LazaruS.,Lazarus takes a long dramatic pause.. ( with resolve ) We could fooster about for donkey's years..Let:'s quit acting the maggot and nix that mentaller. The guys look at each other. What did that mean?
LAZARUS: ( with resolve ) We could fooster about for donkey's years..Let:'s quit acting the maggot and nix that mentaller. The guys look at each other. What did that mean?
RICK: ( he hits a button ) Chris? What is this craziness?
BYON G: Yes, that was Chris. But you will not speak with him again. And do not bother trying to trace this call.
RICK: What's going on? Who is this?
BYONG: We are Flaming Dragon. Speedman is with us now. There is a long silence as Rick processes this. Then he nods slowly.
RICK: Oh. Really. Well I never heard of your little agency. But if you wanna poach my client? Lemme tell you something. His career's been in a death spiral since Simple Jack, so why don't you all go fuck yourselves! Oh, and I bet he hasn't even told you about the whole panda thing! He killed a panda! And next time you're at a cocktail party with Paris Hilton, or at Kate Mantellini's choking down some egg whites with Ron Howard, DON'T LET THAT SLIP, because chances are, I ALREADY DID! Rick slams the phone down.
I: Tropic Thunder 78.
TRAN: ( BEAT ) EXT. HILLTOP NIGHT Up on the.hill., our guys. are back up top, watching Speedman through binoculars.
LAZARUS: Jaysus! We're too late. They brained him! REDYKULOUS grabs the binoculars. Sees for himself.
REDYKULOUS: He's right, man, that ain't right. Messin' with a man's brain.
SANDUSKY: We gotta get him outta there.
SANDUSKY': Here's us. Here's the compound.Here's where Speedman was. It looks like they move him at night, cause he's not here now. Unfortunately we have no idea what the layout of that place is.
PORTNOY: ( sweating and in pain ) I got an idea. Everyone turns to Portnoy.
PORTNOY: It might be a little crazy, but.
REDYKULOUS: Crazy is better than nothin'.
SANDUSKY: What is it?
PORTNOY: ( intermittent pain noises ) Back in '98, I did a low budget titty comedy for skinemax, "Sex Camp". Anyway, me and the campers from the uncool camp had to break into the rich girls' camp. So we did it by building a catapult. They shot us over the wall and we parachuted down. The guys all look at each other. then finally:
LAZARUS: That's the stupidest idea I've ever Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That's lame. I say we wait till just before dawn and sneak over the fence. Take our chances. You guys ok with that? The group nods in approval.
SANDUSKY: Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That's lame. I say we wait till just before dawn and sneak over the fence. Take our chances. You guys ok with that? The group nods in approval.
SANDUSKY: Good. Then let's get some rest. Me and Redyk are on first watch. ( to Lazarus ) I'll wake you in two hours, and we'll They break up. Portnoy comes up to Sandusky, extremely freaked out.
I: Tropic Thunder 80.
PORTNOY: I'm not gonna make it.
SANDUSKY: Yes you are.
PORTNOY: Then you gotta tie me up. I'm serious. Tie me to a tree. No matter how much I scream, or however much-I plead, you.must not untie me. I will be cunning, I will be in pain, and Iwill lie. The devil works this way. I will say, do, and excrete many regrettable things. But.no matter what.. .you must leave me alone. Okay.. .Lazarus, you heard him. Tie him up. We'll get you through it.
SANDUSKY: Okay.. .Lazarus, you heard him. Tie him up. We'll get you through it.
BODYGUARD: ( heav-i-l-y-accented Eng-l-is-h ) Jack.I could never go -to the county ho- down with you. I would be laughed out of town. And what would Chet say? The bodyguards laugh woodenly at Speedman.
SPEEDMAN: B-b-b-b-but I am a G-g-g-ggggoood Dd-d-d- Speedman bows, exhausted and exhilarated. The old women .politely applaud. A new group forms in front of his cage. Speedman stands. He sighs, and begins the movie over Shu-sure is a puh-puh-purty sssssssunrise, uh-uh-uh-uh-ain't it?
SPEEDMAN: Shu-sure is a puh-puh-purty sssssssunrise, uh-uh-uh-uh-ain't it?
BODYGUARD: Go do your chores, slowpoke!!
FOUR LEAF: That poor bastard. Looks like they coo- coo nested him.
CODY: ( IMPATIENT ) So what's the plan?
FOUR LEAF: What plan?
CODY: To get us out of here? Come on man, yoi4 lived this, you gotta have an idea of how we can get out of here? Right? Four Leaf looks a little at a loss.
FOUR LEAF: ( trying to be stoic ) Sometimes the flowing stream can only move when. the water. dries up.
CODY: No offense, but what the hell does that FOUR LEAF It means I'm,sick of your yappin'!
FOUR LEAF: It means I'm,sick of your yappin'!
CODY: Come on man, you heard him back there. They wanna off us! We gotta escape! You
GOTTA: Four Leaf suddenly puts his hook hand right up to Cody's neck. Cody instinctively blocks it with his hand.
FOUR LEAF: I gotta what? Take on the whole compound by myself!
CODY: Stop it man! You're chokin' me!
CODY: AHH! Who the hell are you? Four Leaf looks down, sheepishly.
SANDUSKY: Wow. .look at all those stars. Makes a guy feel pretty small.
REDYKULOUS: Back in LA, we don't get stars like this. I wonder why there are so many here?
SANDUSKY: Back in LA, we don't get stars like this. I wonder why there are so many here?
REDYKULOUS: Man, how can;, you be talking about stars? We might not make it outta here tomorrow.
SANDUSKY: I don't know. I give us pretty good odds. Redykulous looks at'his watch, and lets out a chuckle.
SANDUSKY: What's so funny?

CODY: And you cashed in!

SPEEDMAN: You mu-mu-make me ha-aa-ppy.
SANDUSKY: Oh sweet Jesus. Hold tight, Buddy! I'll be right back! Sandusky runs off to get the guys.
I" 1: Sandusky rounds up Redyk and Lazarus, points to both of his eyes, signalling that he's got "eyes",on Speedman. They take a step in that direction. Redykulous stops them, and makes a made up, absurd signal for "Where is Portnoy?", somehow trying to mime looking for a fat guy. No one knbws what he is doing.

REDYKULOUS: ( FRUSTRATED ) Where is Portnoy?!
SANDUSKY: A muffled, anguished animal noise that could only be PORTNOY emanates from a nearby door. They run towards it. Redykulous kicks it in.
HEROIN HEAVEN: The 'gang flies in, to discover Portnoy holding the bags, What are you doing, man!
REDYKULOUS: What are you doing, man!
SANDUSKY: Come on, let's go! We found Speedmani
PORTNOY: I don't care! It doesn't matter what I do! I'll always be a screw-up! No one will ever respect me.
REDYKULOUS: That's not true! Listen, back in the day, I used to think I couldn't produce a record simply because.

HEROIN ROOM: The guys hear the guards enter the far side of the room. They can't see the guys through the.shelves packed with heroin packets.

PORTNOY: LAUGH AT THAT!! LAUGH AT THAT BASTARD!! The guards let off a BURST OF MACHINE GUN FIRE as Portnoy grinds it into their noses.
CODY: FOUR LEAF Something's happening! Get me the hooks!
FOUR LEAF: Something's happening! Get me the hooks!
HEROIN ROOM: Portnoy watches as the white faced guards fall to their knees, choking and groggy. After a beat, they collapse.
PORTNOY: Let's move! We got about sixteen hours before they wake up! They run out.
SPEEDMAN'S CELL: The guys run in. Redykulous breaks the lock off Speedman's ankle with his rifle butt. Sandusky keeps watch by the door.,
REDYKULOUS,: C'mon! We're busting you out!
SPEEDMAN: Muh-my nnnname is Juh-Jack. Some folks call muh-me Simple Juh-Jack.
REDYKULOUS: What's wrong with him?
SANDUSKY: I think he thinks he's Simple Jack. Like from the movie?
LAZARUS': Shite. I was afraid of this. The same thing happened to me when I played Neil Armstrong in "Moonshot". They found me in an alley in Burbank re-entering the Earth's atmosphere in an old refrigerator Tropic Thunder 96.
REDYKULOUS: I heard that movie was good.
SANDUSKY: Can you fix him?!
LAZARUS: I'll try. Lazarus takes Speedman's face in his hands, forces him to look at him.
LAZARUS: .You're Chris Michael Speedman!
SPEEDMAN: Ah 1-1-likes pie.
LAZARUS: You're the greatest star in the world! There's a flicker of intelligence in Speedman's eyes. It INT. CODYAND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT CONTINUOUS Four Leaf wedges one of the hooks in the. door jamb, and Cody does the same with the other. In one fell swoop, :they bust. the door off its hinges.

SANDUSKY: Is it working?
LAZARUS: JESUS! Give me time, Sandusky! I'm not re- programming a VCR!! ( back to Speedman ) You really committed yourself. And for that you DESERVED AN OSCAR! Speedman registers this.
LAZARUS: ( FRUSTRATED ) C'MON CHRIS! DAMMIT! YOU MUST KNOW WHO YOU ARE! Lazarus's own words make him stop and think.
YOU ARE!: Lazarus's own words make him stop and think.
LAZARUS: ( almost to himself ) You know who you are. . you do Chris. Long beat.
LAZARUS: Unlike me. What am I doing? I can't do this. How can I convince a man he is who we know he is, when I can't even convince myself of the same thing. He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down.
REDYKULOUS: Yo, c'mon, man! Why is everybody gettin'. so insecure alla a sudden?! You're Kirk Lazarus! You're like the greatest actor in the motherfuckin' world!

REDYKULOUS: That's right! We're.not what we're called, or who we pretend to be. We are what we are in our hearts. And to me, looking into your heart, you're a hero.. Lazarus looks to Redykulous.
LAZARUS: You mean that?

SANDUSKY: My name.you remembered my name. You gotta show us the way outta here Chris.
SPEEDMAN: Follow me. This time they do.
HALLWAY: The guys run toward the opening to the courtyard, Speedman leading the way.
SPEEDMAN: That's their supply chopper.
SANDUSKY: If we could create a diversion, we could get to that jeep and drive it right over "Ttopic Thunder 100.
I: "Ttopic Thunder 100.
PORTNOY: Anybody here know how to fly a helicopter? Cause that would come in, handy too.
SPEEDMAN: You want a diversion? I'll give you a diversion. Is this baby loaded? He holds up the machine gun.
SANDUSKY: Yeah, but. And with'that, Speedman runs out in to the courtyard,.. the opposite direction from the jeep, doing a CRAZY WAR'
SANDUSKY: ( to.himself ) .they're blanks. There is a long moment of silence as the guards just stare at Speedman. He seems a. bit surprised that. they are not dead,. as do the guards themselves.

SPEEDMAN: DON'T YOU DIE ON ME! ( then totally surprised ) You have hands?
FOUR LEAF: I ain't Four Leaf, Chris. We're in this mess because of me.
SPEEDMAN: ( can't get over it ) How did you get hands?
FOUR LEAF: I ain't never been worth a nothin'.and it's too late to start bein' a somethin' Speedman tries to understand. He is welling up with emotion.. .real emotion.
FOUR LEAF: ( SINCERELY ) But you. you can tell the story. . .You have to tell the real story. And Four Leaf. or Marvin. dies. Speedman begins to weep. Tears. Yes, he is crying, for AND WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL THIS PLAYING ON A GIANT VIDEO SCREEN AT THE OSCARS. Tropic Thunder 104. Only.

PECK: Ok, look, you wanna go through this again, let's do it. I see more for you than this. This whole 'big fish in the little scary jungle pond' thing. I see you as a front man, as a leader, not just of this little rebel guerilla warrior group. I see it big picture. Is it music, is it movies? Is it a series on Fox? I don't know. But I do know it is not happening with you staring at me doing my "I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings" routine for you and the peanut gallery for another six months. It's old school TRAN and some HENCHMEN watch, unamused. Tran nods, one of the henchmen turns a handle which lowers the cage into the water. After a moment, it comes back up with a soaking Peck.
PECK: ( not missing a beat ) And it makes me sad to see you chomping on the stogie and you're not even fourteen or whatever.
