"THE THING": A thundering.
A SOUND: Loud and strident. A helicopter streaks across frame. It travels precariously close to the ground; its chassis battered and swayed by the wind.
THE COPTER: flying ever lower now. The man with the gun leans dangerously outside and fires away at the dog as it nears the outpost.
THE MEN: outside the compound look to one another, incredulous.
THE COPTER: much too low now, and chastised by the wind, attempts a high- speed landing, directly on the heels of the sprinting dog. It bounces violently on the hard-packed surface. Once. Twice. Passing the dog. A third bounce sends it skidding. It flips; its blades snapping off like toothpicks. It lands belly-up, soundless except for the whine of its engine. The man with the gun rolls out before the explosion.
THE SURVIVOR: of the crash, his eyes crazed with determination, struggles to his feet. Heedless of his companion, he double-times his way to the men and the dog. He reloads his gun and bellows in his Scandinavian tongue. Norris and Bennings have no idea what he is saying. The survivor waves his arms as if shooting them off, screaming as he does so; his face now caked with blood. The two men are bewildered. The dog jumps up, licking and pawing them, imploring for safety. Blam!! The visitor fires. The men jump back in disbelief.
NORRIS: What the fu.
THE SCANDINAVIAN: getting closer. Kablam! Suddenly, his head jerks back. He falls to his knees and then face down into the snow.
CHILDS: pokes his head out from under the snowmobile.
GARRY: Norwegian. Jans Bolen.
FUCHS: Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
GARRY: How far's that?
FUCHS: 'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
GARRY: ( surprised ) That far?
GARRY: You catch anything he was saying?
CHILDS: Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
NORRIS: Yeah. I caught that he wanted the better part of my ass to come apart.
DR. COPPER: Don't "ouch" me. Two stitches. It just grazed you.
BENNINGS: What in the hell were they doing.? Flying that low. shooting at a dog. at us.
DR. COPPER: Stir crazy. Cabin fever. Who knows.
CLARK: I'll be here a while. Shell's pretty
SANCHEZ: It's no go.
BLAIR: Well, get to somebody. Anybody. We've got to report this mess.
SANCHEZ: Look, I haven't been able to reach shit in two weeks. Doubt if anybody's talked to anybody on the whole
NAULS: Maybe we at war with Norway.
PALMER: Was wondering when "El Capitan" was going to get a chance to use his pop
GARRY: How long have they been stationed
FUCHS: Says here about eight weeks. That's not enough time for guys to go bonkers.
GARRY: ( shaking his head ) That's not enough time for guys to go bonkers.
NAULS: Bullshit, Bwana, sweetheart. Five minutes is enough to put a man over down here.
PALMER: Damn straight.
NAULS: I mean Palmer been the way he is since the first day.
GARRY: How many in their party?
FUCHS: ( referring ) Started with six. There'd be four others left.
DR. COPPER: How do you know?
DR. COPPER: .Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
GARRY: Nothing we can do about that.
DR. COPPER: Yes, there is. I'd like to go up.
GARRY: In this weather?
DR. COPPER: ( turns to ) Winds are going to let up a tad, next couple of hours.
BENNINGS: Winds are going to let up a tad, next couple of hours.
GARRY: A tad?
BENNINGS: Can't condone it myself. But it is a short haul. Hour there, hour back.
PALMER: Shit, Doc, I'll give you the lift Forget it, Palmer. Doc, you're a pain in the ass.
GARRY: Forget it, Palmer. Doc, you're a pain in the ass.
GARRY: ( turns ) Norris, go get MacReady.
NORRIS: ( grins ) MacReady ain't going nowhere. Bunkered in till spring.
GARRY: Just go get him.
NORRIS: ( stands ) Anyway, he's probably ripped.
VOICE: Bishop to knight four.
MACREADY: Poor little son of a bitch. You're starting to lose it, aren't you?
VOICE: Pawn takes queen at knight four.
VOICE: Rook to knight six. Check. .Cheating bastard.
MACREADY: .Cheating bastard.
NORRIS: You jerking off or just pissed?
MACREADY: We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
NORRIS: Get your gear on.
MACREADY: What for?
MACREADY: .Craziness. This is goddamn insane.
GARRY: .Quit the griping MacReady. Sooner you're there sooner you're
MACREADY: It's against regulations to go up this time of year!
DR. COPPER: Screw regulations! Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
MACREADY: So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
GARRY: Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady Palmer's offered to take him up.
MACREADY: What are you talking?! He's had two months training in those choppers!
PALMER: ( defiant ) ( to Bennings ) What is it out there, anyway? Forty- five knots?
MACREADY: ( to Bennings ) What is it out there, anyway? Forty- five knots?
BENNINGS: ( disgusted ) And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?! You can't predict this time of year.
MACREADY: ( disgusted ) And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?! You can't predict this time of year.
CLARK: Mac's really taking it up, huh?
THE CHOPPER: MacReady unhinges the shotgun that is latched to the panel behind the seats.
DR. COPPER: Anybody there?!
MACREADY: Anybody in there?! We're Americans! Come to help you!!
DR. COPPER: We're Americans! Come to help you!!
MACREADY: Come to help you!!
MACREADY: Give me a hand. Hey, Sweden.! You okay?
MACREADY: Hey, Sweden.! You okay?
MACREADY: Dr. Copper spots something. From the man's wrist on the armrest, he follows a long, yarn-thick, red line, ending in a pool of frozen blood on the floor. The two men step around the chair. The Norwegian stares up in blanched death. A gaping black hole for a mouth. His throat and wrists slit. An old-fashioned straight razor in his lap. MacReady turns off the hissing radio, and marches to the other door. It is locked and barricaded.
DR. COPPER: ( more to himself ) My God, what in hell happened here?
MACREADY: Come on, Copper.
MACREADY: Hey, Sweden!!!
DR. COPPER: ( irritated ) They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe
MACREADY: Norwegian of the Month, Doc. Harmless.
MACREADY: ( wincing ) Holy shit.
DR. COPPER: They step over the arm and into another slim passageway. Moving along they come to rest in front of a door with Norwegian lettering on it. MacReady pushes it open with his foot. Dozens of papers fly about, flailed by the holes in the Quonset hut-style roof. The place is a wreck. They enter. MacReady surveying the small room with his flashlight.
DR. COPPER: Broken beakers, test tubes, a microscope are illuminated. MacReady notices a video camera.
MACREADY: Portable video unit.
MACREADY: DR. COPPER
DR. COPPER: All in Norwegian.
MACREADY: What are you doing?
DR. COPPER: Could be important work. Might as well bring it back.
MACREADY: It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm going to check the last few rooms.
MACREADY: Careful. It's about to go.
DR. COPPER: Watch it.
GARRY: Turn that crap down, Nauls. You can hear it all over the camp!
NAULS: Oui, Bwana. Can do.
SANCHEZ: Hey, man.!
GARRY: You reach anybody yet?
SANCHEZ: We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man. It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
GARRY: Well, stick to it.
MAN'S VOICE: Hello boy.
CLARK: opens the door to the small kennel and serves up the dinner. The dogs, about seven of them, yelp and bark eagerly.
CHILDS: How my brothers and sister doing today? Doin' fine.
CHILDS: What say to some nice Al Green for my babies, huh? What you.? You get the hell on out of here.
CHILDS: What you.? You get the hell on out of here.
CHILDS: .Comin' in here. goin' to urinate on my babies.
PALMER: Clark! Will you kennel this goddamn Hey, Clark?!
THE DOG: It paws at the window and watches as the chopper, carrying MacReady and Dr. Copper, fights against the newly arrived heavy winds and lands safely.
NORRIS: .Seems they were spending a lot of time at a place four miles northeast of their camp.
GARRY: What were they involved in?
MACREADY: Little ice core drilling. some seismology. glaciology. same old shit we do.
BENNINGS: How much more of this crap is there?
DR. COPPER: About nine more hours.
BENNINGS: We can't learn anything from this.
DR. COPPER: Probably right.
DR. COPPER: MacReady and I were listening to some of these cassettes on the way Like you gentlemen to hear it.
BENNINGS: What do you want from us?
MACREADY: ( flat ) Just listen.
DR. COPPER: Goes on like that quite awhile. What do you gentlemen make of it?
GARRY: Could be anything. Men in isolation. some beef that snowballed. got out of hand.
NORRIS: Maybe the whole camp got bent. Something they ate. What about food poisoning, Doc?
DR. COPPER: He glances at MacReady, and then back to the others.
DR. COPPER: There's something else we want you to see.
DR. COPPER: We found this.
DR. COPPER: I know he's pretty badly burned. but could fire have done this?
DR. COPPER: Blair, I'd like you and Fuchs to help me with autopsies on this one and the one Garry shot this morning.
BENNINGS: Clark, will you put this mutt with the others where he belong?!
DR. COPPER: Nothing wrong with this one. Physiologically, anyway. Find anything toxic?
BLAIR: No drugs. alcohol. Nothing.
DR. COPPER: I don't understand.
BLAIR: It's tissue from one of these sinewy
FUCHS: What in the world kind of cell structure is this?
BLAIR: That's the point.
DR. COPPER: ( tired ) I don't get you, Blair.
BLAIR: I'm not sure it is any kind of cell structure. Biologically speaking.
DR. COPPER: ( sighing ) This really isn't my field, Blair. Let's wrap for the day.
MACREADY: Decanite.? Thermite charges.?
MACREADY: What in.
MACREADY: No response. MacReady nudges him. Clark rolls away, annoyed. MacReady pinches his snoring nose, cutting off the air. Clark sits up, groggy.
MACREADY: Dogtown's going nuts. Take care of
CLARK: reaches the kennel door. The savage outpouring of noise from within baffles and angers him. He unlatches the door.
CLARK: What's got into.
CLARK: I don't know what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is.
CHILDS: Mac wants the what?!
BENNINGS: ( at the doorway ) That's what he said. Now! Move!
CLARK: Mac, where are you?
GARRY: What's going on, damn it?
MACREADY: I'm going to shoot.
CLARK: No! Wait!!
OUTSIDE: More men running, nearing the kennel. Several squeezing in with Garry, trying to get a look.
INSIDE: MacReady fires several rounds. A dog is flung at him, knocking him and his flashlight once more to the ground. Garry squeezes in and begins blasting away in the direction of the hissing and screeching. A dog is hit. MacReady crawls for his flashlight.
MACREADY: Clark? Where are you? Clark!
CHILDS: What's happening?
CHILDS: Where are you?
MACREADY: Torch it over there!
CHILDS: The dogs?
MACREADY: Screw the dogs!! Torch it!!
GARRY: ( panic ) We're on fire!
MACREADY: Don't let up, Childs!
GARRY: ( to outside )
NAULS: It's okay now, man. It's dead. It's You see.
CLARK: I know. Mr. Childs killed it. I saw.
NAULS: Right, man. Right.
NORRIS: Here. This is where they were spending most of their time.
BENNINGS: Pretty nasty out, Mac. Thirty-five Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
MACREADY: Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
BLAIR: Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
GARRY: I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
CHILDS: ( evenly ) "tweren't no dog, Bwana.
BLAIR: That tape MacReady showed us this Couldn't make much of it myself.
GARRY: Couldn't make much of it myself.
BLAIR: I've asked him to try and locate the site. Okay with you?
GARRY: Sure. You think there's a connection?
BLAIR: EXT. CHOPPER high above the Antarctic expanse.
NORRIS: One of their sites would be directly over here.
ON BLAIR: A disturbed look on his face. He checks his watch, as if timing the procedure.
PALMER: MacReady finds a burst thermite canister. He and Norris climb They move along amongst the wreck. Almost everything but the skeletal superstructure has disintegrated into a fine ashy Norris digs for ice samples at the perimeter of the wreckage, while MacReady browses through the center. Palmer continues to marvel, as he walks around the oval, atop the ice. MacReady returns and kneels down next to Norris as the latter examines a piece of metal.
NORRIS: Magnesium of some type. or some kind of strange alloy. And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
MACREADY: So what do you make of it?
NORRIS: You know damn well what we both make of it.
MACREADY: No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
NORRIS: Seismic activity has been pushing this are up from way down for a long .This ice it was buried in. It's over a hundred thousand years
CHILDS: Okay now, Mac, run this by me again. Thousands of years ago this rocket ship crashes, right.? And the.
CHILDS: Look, I'm just guessing.
MACREADY: Look, I'm just guessing.
CHILDS: Well, go on.
NAULS: Where's that big ol' steel pot of mine?! Damn!
MACREADY: .So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
CHILDS: I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit. You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
PALMER: ( rambling ) Happens all the time, man. They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it. Chariots of the Gods, man. They practically own South America. I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew.
CHILDS: Cool it, Palmer!!
PALMER: Read von Daniken! Have you read von Daniken? Get your facts straight!
CLARK: Jesus, why would those guys ever want to leave Norway.?
NAULS: Which one you muthers been tossing his dirty underwear in the kitchen I want my kitchen clean. Germ free! So, MacReady, come on now. These Norwegian dudes come by. find him and dig him up.
NAULS: I want my kitchen clean. Germ free! So, MacReady, come on now. These Norwegian dudes come by. find him and dig him up.
CHILDS: So, MacReady, come on now. These Norwegian dudes come by. find him and dig him up.
MACREADY: Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back. He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl.
CHILDS: Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, I don't know how. Because he's different than we are. Because he's a space guy. What do you want from me, anyway. Go ask Blair.
MACREADY: ( annoyed ) I don't know how. Because he's different than we are. Because he's a space guy. What do you want from me, anyway. Go ask Blair.
CHILDS: You buy any of this, Blair?
BLAIR: It was here. got to that dog. It was here in this camp.
GARRY: So.? So what? It's over with.
BENNINGS: ( edgy ) Well, isn't it?
BLAIR: Whatever that Norwegian dog was. It. It was capable of changing its .when it attacked our dog. it somehow was able to digest. or. absorb it. and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly. .This for instance isn't dog at all it's imitation. We got to it before it had time to finish or.
NAULS: Finish what?
BLAIR: .I think the whole process would have taken an hour. maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
PALMER: Well, that Thing in the ice sure weren't no dog.
BLAIR: ( impatient ) Of course not. But whatever it was revived, it. Well, The Thing was probably disoriented. and realized it couldn't survive for long in our atmosphere. But being the incredibly adaptable creature it was. it tried to become something that could. Before the Norwegians killed it. it somehow got to this dog.
CLARK: What do you mean "got" to the dog?
BLAIR: It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell. The concept is staggering. I know. I. I don't fully understand it You're saying. that big muther in the ice, became the dog.
BLAIR: The concept is staggering. I know. I. I don't fully understand it You're saying. that big muther in the ice, became the dog.
CHILDS: ( skeptically, points ) You're saying. that big muther in the ice, became the dog.
BLAIR: ( nodding ) I think we're talking about an organism. that could imitate other life forms. perfectly. It could have gone on and on. It could have become one dog. It could have become as many dogs as it wanted to and without losing any of its original You been into Childs' weed, Blair?
NORRIS: You been into Childs' weed, Blair?
BLAIR: Look, I know it's hard to believe.
GARRY: ( breaking in ) So what's our problem?
BLAIR: Well. there's still some cell activity. it's not entirely dead
MACREADY: And the horse you rode in on, Fuchs. Light it up. Well, I'm not going to let this
FUCHS: Well, I'm not going to let this
FUCHS: I just can't believe it. We're going to go down as the biggest bunch of assholes in history.
MACREADY: Fuck history. At least we're going to live to be an old bunch of
BLAIR: ( perplexed, bothered ) Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog? Just anything at all? Any little thing?
CLARK: No. Just that he recovered real quick. That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage. Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good.
BLAIR: That night?
CLARK: ( pets dog vigorously ) What was he doing in the rec room?
BLAIR: What was he doing in the rec room?
CLARK: Well, after I worked on him thought I'd let him rest. Left the room for a bit. When I came back, he was gone.
BLAIR: Well, where was he? Where did he go?
CLARK: Don't know. Looked for him for a bit. couldn't find him.
BLAIR: ( a long beat ) You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
CLARK: Well. yeah.
BLAIR: How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
CLARK: Ah. He was hurt bad. Bullet nicked an artery. I don't know. An hour. hour and a half.
CLARK: What the hell you looking at me like that for?
BLAIR: Nothing. Nothing at all.
BLAIR: .It could have gotten to somebody.
GARRY: Anybody sick?
BLAIR: No, I. I don't mean infection. or disease.
GARRY: Any luck yet?
SANCHEZ: Couple seconds of an Argentine disco Well, stick with it. I want you at it round the clock. We got to get help in here.
GARRY: Well, stick with it. I want you at it round the clock. We got to get help in here.
BLAIR: ( alarm ) No. No, you can't let anyone in here. That dog was all over this
BENNINGS: ( to Garry ) Travel-wise, tomorrow may be okay. But after that some pretty nasty northeasterly shit's coming in.
FUCHS: .Goddamn fools.
BLAIR: ( pleading ) Listen to me, Garry. Please.
GARRY: ( to MacReady ) If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo.
BLAIR: No! You can't let people
MACREADY: I ain't going anywhere in anything over forty knots,
GARRY: ( snapping ) The hell you won't, MacReady!
BLAIR: Don't you understand?! That Thing didn't want to become a dog.
GARRY: ( fed up ) Damn you, Blair! You've already got everybody half-hysterical around You can't let anybody leave!
BLAIR: You can't let anybody leave!
GARRY: I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century. Now fuck off!
MACREADY: All set.
MACREADY: To us.
MACREADY: Now go easy on me, Esperanza. I'm just a beginner.
CHESS VOICE: Rook takes bishop at Queen four Rook take pawn at Queen two Rook takes Queen at Queen one Checkmate.
MACREADY: Aw shit.
MACREADY: Sorry, hon.
MACREADY: Never any damn ice around here.
MACREADY: Now in Mexico. Tahiti. They got ice. They got ice coming out of their ears.
MACREADY: as he makes his way down with the aid of the steadying ropes. The clanking louder now. He senses the direction.
MACREADY: at the bottom near the main compound. The sound has stopped. He looks around in the near blackness. A beat.
THE CHOPPERS: sitting idle in the dark. MacReady approaches. The door to one of the cockpits is slightly ajar. He opens it cautiously.
MACREADY: Blair. He's gone berserk.
PALMER: Blair. He's gone berserk.
BENNINGS: He's in the radio room. Got a gun. Beat on Sanchez something fierce.
RADIO ROOM: Sanchez lies on the floor, groaning. Blair holds the gun on the door. He wields a fire ax with the other hand and smashes down on the radio.
BLAIR: Anybody interferes, I'll kill! Nobody's getting in or out of this
HALLWAY: MacReady has joined the others.
MACREADY: He smashed one of the choppers up good. Childs, go check the other one and the tractor.
RADIO ROOM: Blair crunches the ax down once again, while keeping an eye on the door.
BLAIR: .You think I'm crazy? Fine! Most of you don't know what's going on but I'm damn well sure some of you
NORRIS: The back window. A couple of us could maybe surprise him.
MACREADY: Too damn dangerous.
BLAIR: .You think this Thing wants to become an animal? Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea. No skua gulls to imitate this time of year. No penguins this far inland. Don't you understand?! It wanted to become
CHILDS: He got both choppers and the tractor. I don't know how bad yet.
MACREADY: No, wait a minute. The fuse box.
BLAIR: .Can't you see.? If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it! Nothing!
MACREADY: ( humoring ) Look Blair, maybe you're right about this. But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over. I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
BLAIR: No, you're not! I don't trust any of
NORRIS: reaches the fuse box. He opens it.
HALLWAY: MacReady readies the table like a shield.
MACREADY: If you're right we've all got to stick together.
BLAIR: Why am I here?
DR. COPPER: It's for your own protection, Blair.
MACREADY: And mainly ours.
MACREADY: Leave a bit of an opening so he can see out.
MACREADY: How you doin', old boy?
BLAIR: ( softly ) I don't know who to trust.
MACREADY: ( humoring ) Know what you mean, Blair. Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
BLAIR: ( beat ) Watch Clark.
MACREADY: Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
BLAIR: Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
SANCHEZ: I'll see what I can do. But they didn't teach me much about fixing these things.
NORRIS: They didn't teach you much about working them either.
DR. COPPER: Put this in Blair's juice before you take him his tray.
CLARK: The dogs.
GARRY: Doesn't look broken.
CLARK: No. Door was wide open. I know I latched it.
CLARK: All three of them took off.
DR. COPPER: How long do you suppose they've been I haven't seen them since their last feeding. Could be as much as twenty- four hours.
CLARK: I haven't seen them since their last feeding. Could be as much as twenty- four hours.
MACREADY: They couldn't have gotten that far in this weather.
GARRY: You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
MACREADY: I am going after them.
NORRIS: What in the hell for? Even if Blair's right they'll just die out there. No food. They're over a thousand miles from anything.
PALMER: Chopper aren't going to be ready for
MACREADY: Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
GARRY: You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
MACREADY: Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
PALMER: ( grins ) Oh, I got you. Not too long.
MACREADY: Then get a move on. Childs, come with me.
GARRY: ( shouting after them ) Besides, what are you going to do when you catch up to them?
BENNINGS: Holy shit. Whatever he's going to do, he ain't fucking around.
CHILDS: I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
MACREADY: That's good enough.
BENNINGS: All right. Box of dynamite. box of thermite. three shotguns. box of flares. two flare guns. thirty cans gasoline. and a case of Let's load 'em.
MACREADY: Let's load 'em.
THE SUN: sliding across the horizon, signaling midday. The snowmobiles whoosh past. Bennings drives the one loaded with supplies. MacReady and Childs double up on the other.
MACREADY: steadying his binoculars, while Childs drives, spots something up ahead. The vehicles slow down and come to a halt. Something lies just ahead of them in the whiteness, in the middle of the dog tracks.
THE MEN: kneel down by the "something." It is the half-eaten remains of a dog. Its hind legs and lower stomach picked clean. Its ripped hide, flapping in the wind. Its top half missing.
CHILDS: What is it?
MACREADY: Maybe dinner.
BENNINGS: Dogs don't eat each other.
MACREADY: ( beat ) I know.
CHILDS: Where's the other half?
MACREADY: Probably the next meal.
MACREADY: Where these tracks headed?
BENNINGS: Nowhere. Just straight to the ocean.
MACREADY: Let's move.
CHILDS: They could be hours ahead of us, Gonna get dark soon, too. Supposed to be fifty below tonight.
BENNINGS: Gonna get dark soon, too. Supposed to be fifty below tonight.
MACREADY: Turn back if you want.
THE SUN: making its last pass, rolling off the horizon. Only a slight orange hue left.
THE SNOWMOBILES: move slower, positioned on either side of the tracks. The tracks abruptly change direction. The men come to a stop. It is much colder now. Their beards, a mask of white powder. MacReady surveys the new direction. They are headed toward a far-off ridge of bluffs. Large, windswept mounds of ice.
THE SNOWMOBILES: as they move through a valley of newly-formed dunes and tall ice cliffs. The last of the sun obscured, the headlamps are turned on and pointed at the tracks. The men look behind, in front, and from side to side, as they proceed cautiously through the maze. Up ahead MacReady A DOG It sits, its back to them, unconcerned, heedless of their arrival. It is munching on the other half of the dog carcass. The men stop their machines some twenty yards from it. They are hemmed in at the valley's narrowest point. Childs, carrying the torch, and MacReady, armed with a thermite bomb, wade awkwardly but carefully toward the animal in their snowshoes. Bennings stands back by the snowmobiles. Childs and MacReady spread out some dozen feet from the dog. It continues to pay them no mind, content to chew its food.

CHILDS: Where's the other one?
MACREADY: ( to dog ) Where's your buddy, boy? Huh?
MACREADY: Let that thing fly, Childs. Don't let up until he's ash.
MACREADY: Childs stops, confused as to who to help first. He notices the dog hunched and ready to spring. He steps back toward MacReady. The dog/Thing leaps for MacReady; an incredible jump of some twenty feet. Childs lets loose a blast, hitting the dog in midair; the force of the spray knocking it back and tumbling to the ice in flames. MacReady throws his thermite canister. It discharges and engulfs the screeching animal in fire.
BENNINGS: howling in pain. The ice underneath him thrashes violently. Childs and MacReady stand by helplessly, unable to see what has him or what action to take. Childs moves closer to help.
MACREADY: ( pulls him back ) Stay back!!
CHILDS: What we going to do?!
MACREADY: How the fuck do I know?!
MACREADY: Torch them!!
CHILDS: He's gone already! Do it!
MACREADY: He's gone already! Do it!
THE SUN: Its slim, orange arc sets, signaling the start of the Vernal Equinox. And the beginning of six months of darkness.
CLARK: .I'm telling you I don't remember leaving the kennel unlatched.
CHILDS: Bullshit! You left it open so they could get out!
CLARK: .Would I even have told you they were gone if I had anything to hide?
GARRY: But why didn't you kennel that dog right away?
CLARK: I told you I couldn't find. .get that out of my face.
CHILDS: Don't you be telling me.
NAULS: ( to Childs ) Lighten your load, sucker. You ain't the judge and executioner around Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker? I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
CHILDS: Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker? I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
GARRY: Hold on, damn it. We're getting nowhere. If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true. then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
DR. COPPER: And if it got to Clark. Clark could have gotten to anybody.
DR. COPPER: Theoretically any of us could be whatever the hell this thing is. It's just too damn wild I can't believe it.
NORRIS: It's just too damn wild I can't believe it.
MACREADY: Well, you can believe it now.
MACREADY: Nauls found this yesterday. It's ripped just like the clothing on the Norwegian we brought back. The same thing was happening to Bennings' clothes when it got to him. Seems these Things don't imitate clothes. Just flesh and bone.
MACREADY: Size large. What do you wear, Clark?
CLARK: So what?
NORRIS: I wear a size large, too.
MACREADY: So do I. So do most of us.
MACREADY: Doubt if it got to more than one or two of us. But it got to someone. Somebody in this room ain't what he appears to be.
SANCHEZ: ( scared ) Well, what we going to do?
NORRIS: Can there be. some kind of test? To find out who's what?
DR. COPPER: A serum test possibly.
FUCHS: Right. Why not?
GARRY: What's that?
DR. COPPER: It's a simple blood typing test. This Thing's blood chemistry is different than ours. Basically we mix someone's blood with uncontaminated human blood. If we don't get the proper serum reaction then that person isn't human.
CHILDS: Whose uncontaminated blood we going to use?
DR. COPPER: We've got blood plasma in storage.
GARRY: How long will it take you to prepare A couple of hours.
DR. COPPER: A couple of hours.
GARRY: Well, get to it.
PALMER: How's that Thing get to the dogs? I though we stopped it in time.
MACREADY: Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
PALMER: And that was enough?
DR. COPPER: Somebody got to the blood. sabotaged Oh, my God.
NAULS: Oh, my God.
MACREADY: Was it broken into?
FUCHS: No. Somebody opened it. Closed it. And then locked it.
MACREADY: Well, who's got access to it?
DR. COPPER: I guess I'm the only one.
GARRY: And I've got the only key.
MACREADY: Would that test have worked?
DR. COPPER: I think so.
NORRIS: Somebody else sure as hell thought Who else could have used that key?
MACREADY: Who else could have used that key?
GARRY: Ah. no one. I give it to Copper when he needs it.
MACREADY: Could anyone have gotten it from I don't see how. when I'm finished I return it right away.
DR. COPPER: I don't see how. when I'm finished I return it right away.
NORRIS: When was the last time you used it?
DR. COPPER: ( uneasy ) A day or so ago. I guess.
GARRY: I suppose. well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me. But.
CHILDS: That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you Look, I haven't been near that. that refrigerator.
GARRY: ( upset, flustered ) Look, I haven't been near that. that refrigerator.
GARRY: Copper's the only one who has any business with it.
DR. COPPER: Now. wait a second, Garry, you've been in here on several occasions.
FUCHS: And the Doc thought of the test.
CHILDS: ( anger ) So what?! Is that supposed to leave him in the clear?! Bullshit!
GARRY: Hey, Sanchez!
SANCHEZ: in terror, runs at top speed through the narrow corridors. Opening and shutting doors. The others are in pursuit. They shout for him to stop.
SANCHEZ: as he reaches a small armory. A glass case set into the wall. A half dozen rarely used guns are inside. He tries the handle. He hears the clamor of feet and voices as the others are nearing. He breaks the glass and grabs a shotgun. Then a box of shells. He frantically tries to load, but is too nervous. The others arrive at the end of the hallway. Garry pulls his handgun and points.
GARRY: Put that down!
SANCHEZ: ( trembling ) I'll put this right through your
GARRY: I'll put this right through your
SANCHEZ: You guys going to let him give orders? I mean he could be one of those
MACREADY: ( calm ) Put it away, Sanchez. Just put it
GARRY: I don't know about Copper. But I didn't go near that plasma. But I guess you'll all rest easier if someone else is in charge.
GARRY: Can't see anyone objecting to you, Sorry, gentlemen. .Don't think I'd be up to it. Haven't been feeling well lately.
NORRIS: Sorry, gentlemen. .Don't think I'd be up to it. Haven't been feeling well lately.
CHILDS: I'll take it.
MACREADY: Maybe it should be someone a bit more even-tempered, Childs.
MACREADY: ( to others ) .Any objections?
MACREADY: .From what we know this Thing likes to go one on one. So we stick together as much as possible. In two's and
CHILDS: What do we do about those three?
MACREADY: We got morphine, don't we.
MACREADY: Well, we keep them loaded. Stash them here in the rec room and watch 'em twenty-four hours.
PALMER: ( ears perk up ) Morphine? You know I was pretty close to that dog, too.
NORRIS: We should sleep in shifts.
MACREADY: Right. Half of us awake at all times.
SANCHEZ: How we going to try and find out who's. you know, who's who?
MACREADY: ( to Fuchs ) Can you think of any other tests?
FUCHS: I'll try. I could sure use Copper's help though.
CHILDS: You can eighty-six that thought right now, man.
MACREADY: Also. When this Thing turns. it turns slowly at first. I think we can handle it in that state. But if it ever got to full power. from what I saw of that Norwegian camp. well, I just don't know. It would probably take it an hour or more to get like that. So no matter what anybody's doing, we all return to this room every twenty minutes. Anybody gone longer than that. anybody trying to leave. we kill
PALMER: ( mumbles ) Where's that magneto? Can't find a darn thing around here any more.
DR. COPPER: I'll do it. You're going to break the needle in my arm.
CHILDS: No, Doc. He's doing a real fine job.
MACREADY: Look for shoes, too. And burned cloth.
NAULS: That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
MACREADY: Just keep looking.
MACREADY: How's it going?
FUCHS: Nothing yet. But, MacReady, I've been thinking. If our dogs changed by swallowing parts of that other one. We better see to it that everyone prepares their own food and we eat out of cans.
MACREADY: EXT. COMPOUND A siren goes off, signaling the end of a twenty-minute period. Sanchez pulls himself out of the trash dump. Palmer carries a large part of a helicopter engine toward the compound.
PALMER: Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
CHILDS: Ain't it there?
PALMER: No it ain't there. Would I be asking if it were there?
MACREADY: Move it, Palmer.
HALLWAY: The three move down the hall toward their appointed rendezvous at the rec room.
MACREADY: ( to Palmer ) Start taking apart those snowmobiles next, huh?
NAULS: I got your goodies, superdude. What you doin'?
NAULS: What you doin'?
BLAIR: Nobody's getting in here. You can tell them all that!
NAULS: Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
NAULS: Now why'd you go and.
BLAIR: And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it. I know what you're up to. Don't think I don't. And if anyone tries to get in here I've got rope. I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
NAULS: You promise?
NAULS: Crazy white scientist motherfucker.
CLARK: Gotta go to the can, Childs.
CHILDS: Be quick.
CHILDS: Oh, no.
CHILDS: No. The generator. You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it. Where's the damn flashlight? You fellas okay over there?
CHILDS: Cut that out, Copper. Nauls? What's taking you?!
CHILDS: That's impossible, man! Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
CHILDS: ( shouting ) Clark, you come on out here!!
CHILDS: Where's. Where's Garry?
CHILDS: Where are you, Garry? Don't you move an inch, Copper. Nauls, bring me a goddamn flashlight!
NAULS: Somebody's taken it. I can't find Clark, you want me to come in after
MACREADY: ( shouting ) What's happened?!
MACREADY: NORRIS ( O.S. )
MACREADY: ( to Palmer ) Well, let's get down there.
MACREADY: CHILDS ( O.S. )
MACREADY: ( to self ) Oh, shit! ( shouts ) Well, hang on!
MACREADY: Where's Sanchez?
PALMER: The fuel pump. it's gone. You've got to get up to supply, Mca. If we don't get this thing started soon, it'll freeze on us and we'll never get it going.
MACREADY: Who. Who is that?
MACREADY: Sanchez.? Hey, who.
PALMER: Somebody definitely messed with it.
MACREADY: We going to make it?
PALMER: Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes. What I don't get is.
SANCHEZ: Where were the flashlights?
MACREADY: Screw the flashlights. Where the hell were you?
PALMER: Tons of stuff's been missing around here. Magnetos, cables, wire.
NAULS: Kitchen things, too.
MACREADY: Anybody see Fuchs. or hear him.?
CHILDS: Where'd you go?
CHILDS: I said where? Where'd you go?!
GARRY: Was dark. find a light.
CHILDS: You lying bastard.
GARRY: ( slurring ) I rather don't like your tone.
CHILDS: You sit back down.
NORRIS: MacReady, furious, pulls Childs away. Norris breathing heavily from the activity, massages his chest. The strong, stormy winds overhead batter the roofing. MacReady glances up. He and Childs release each other.
MACREADY: That storm's going to start ripping any minute so we don't have much
MACREADY: We've got to find Fuchs. When we find him we kill him.
SANCHEZ: If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes. Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks.
MACREADY: If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes. Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks.
MACREADY: Sanchez, you and Palmer search the I ain't going with Sanchez. I ain't going with him. I'll go with Well, screw you, man!
PALMER: I ain't going with Sanchez. I ain't going with him. I'll go with Well, screw you, man!
PALMER: I ain't going with him. I'll go with Well, screw you, man!
SANCHEZ: Well, screw you, man!
PALMER: I ain't going with you!
CHILDS: Well, who says I want you going with Cut the bullshit. Okay, Sanchez, you come with us. Norris. you stay Any of them move you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren. We all meet back here in twenty minutes And everybody watch whoever you're with. Real close.
MACREADY: Cut the bullshit. Okay, Sanchez, you come with us. Norris. you stay Any of them move you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren. We all meet back here in twenty minutes And everybody watch whoever you're with. Real close.
MACREADY: Let's move.
PALMER: What'd we ever do to these Things Don't walk behind me.
PALMER: Don't walk behind me.
CHILDS: Don't walk behind me.
PALMER: He moves to the other side of the wall, parallel with Childs. They continue on, skimming along the sides of the corridor in plain view of one another.
MACREADY: Hey, Blair!!
MACREADY: Has Fuchs been out here? I've changed my mind. I'd. I'd like to come back inside. I don't want to stay out here any more. Funny things. I hear funny things out here.
BLAIR: I've changed my mind. I'd. I'd like to come back inside. I don't want to stay out here any more. Funny things. I hear funny things out here.
MACREADY: Have you come across Fuchs?
BLAIR: Fuchs.? No, it's not Fuchs. You must let me back in. I won't harm anyone. I promise.
MACREADY: We'll see.
BLAIR: I promise! I'm much better now! I'll be good!! I'm all better!! Don't leave me here!!
DR. COPPER: I'm getting worried about you. You ought to have a checkup.
NORRIS: Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
DR. COPPER: ( yawning ) After all this mess then.
NORRIS: ( nodding ) After all this mess.
PALMER: Auxiliary light cables.? Been cut.
CHILDS: Cut, bullshit. Been pulled apart.
NAULS: ( shouting to be heard ) Where's the roof?! This storm do that?
NAULS: This storm do that?
MACREADY: ( shouting ) Couldn't be possible. Must have weighted a ton and a half.
NAULS: Goddamn white women.
CHILDS: My babies. Somebody broke in.
PALMER: Somebody broke in.
CHILDS: Now who'd go and do.
PALMER: Let go of me.
CHILDS: Let go of me.
PALMER: Don't get near 'em. The plants! They're alive. Those things can imitate anything.
CHILDS: What's it going to do, being a plant?
PALMER: We got to burn 'em.
CHILDS: Now hold on, you dumb.
CHILDS: You stupid, sonofa.
FUCHS: One arm outstretched, swings into view. An ax, embedded deep into his chest, pins his frozen body to the inside of the INT. REC ROOM Norris startled by the scream, turns on the siren.
SANCHEZ: Whoever put this through him.
SANCHEZ: .is one bad-ass and strong muther.
CHILDS: No one's that strong, boy!
PALMER: Why didn't it imitate Fuchs? Isn't that its number to get more Wasn't enough time. Generator was out, what.? Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
CHILDS: Wasn't enough time. Generator was out, what.? Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
SANCHEZ: Why Fuchs?
CHILDS: He was working on a test. Fuchs must have been onto something. These bastards got scared and got rid of .Hey. Where's.
PALMER: CLOSE ON CHILDS
CHILDS: Nauls!! MacReady!!
CHILDS: How long they been out now?
NORRIS: Forty. Forty-five minutes.
CHILDS: We better start closing off the outside hatchways.
THE MEN: weapons in hand, huddle at the main doorway. They unbolt it. Sleet and hail send Nauls rolling in from the outside. The men force the door back and lock it. The weary Nauls kneels on the floor and gasps for air. The others surround him.
PALMER: Where's MacReady?
NAULS: Cut him loose of the line up by his Cut him loose?
CHILDS: Cut him loose?
NAULS: When we were up poking around his place. I found this.
NAULS: .It was stashed in his old coal furnace. wind must have dislodged it. I don't think he saw me find
NAULS: .Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back. cut him loose.
SANCHEZ: ( incredulous ) He's one of them.
NAULS: He's one of them.
SANCHEZ: ( scared ) When do you think it got to him?
PALMER: Could have been anytime. Anywhere.
CHILDS: ( to Nauls, suspicious ) If it did get to him.
NAULS: Look, man.
PALMER: When the lights went out.
NORRIS: Would have been a perfect time.
PALMER: Right. Garry was missing. .And Sanchez.
SANCHEZ: ( goes for him ) Fuck you, Palmer.
NORRIS: This is just what it wants. to pit us against each other.
NAULS: ( harsh whisper ) Bullshit! He's got to know damn well I cut it!
PALMER: Let's open it.
CHILDS: Hell no.
SANCHEZ: ( shaking ) You think he's changed into one of those Things?
NORRIS: He hasn't had enough time.
CHILDS: .Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a .Where is everybody?! I'm half Let's open it. Now.
PALMER: Let's open it. Now.
CHILDS: ( edgy, hostile ) Why you so damn anxious to let him in here.
PALMER: ( slightly trembling ) He's so close. Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
CHILDS: No. Just let him freeze out there.
SANCHEZ: ( voice cracking ) What if we're wrong about him?
CHILDS: Then we're wrong.
PALMER: The supply window!
SANCHEZ: ( terror ) What we going to.
NORRIS: All right. all right. we've got no choice now.
MACREADY: What's going on out there?
HALLWAY: Palmer stands by as Childs tries the knob. Locked.
CHILDS: Damn it, he's got the keys.
MACREADY: What are you doing?
MACREADY: What clothes?
MACREADY: Someone's trying to mark me, you bastard. trying to frame me.
HALLWAY: Childs cautions to Palmer as he prepares for one last blow.
CHILDS: Move in slow now.
MACREADY: Anyone messes with me the whole camp goes.
MACREADY: Put those torches on the floor and back off.
HALLWAY: The men step backwards carefully.
MACREADY: .back way off.
MACREADY: .Where's the rest.
MACREADY: So help me I mean it!!
NAULS: It's cool, man. We ain't near you, man. Stay cool.
PALMER: Yeah, man, really. Just relax.
MACREADY: Anybody touches me. we go.
NAULS: I don't think he's breathing.
MACREADY: Go untie the Doc. Get him in here. Bring the others, too. From now on no one gets out of my
MACREADY: So you sweethearts had yourselves a little trial. I just may have to kill you on general principle, Nauls.
MACREADY: .Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up.
CHILDS: We ain't buying that.
DR. COPPER: Damn it, quit the bickering and give me a hand. Wheel that fibrillator over here.
DR. COPPER: Palmer, turn on that oxygen and hold the mask over his face. Childs, grab his shoulders.
CHILDS: ( to MacReady, threatening ) You're going to have to sleep Quiet down. ( to Sanchez ) .turn that thing on.
DR. COPPER: Quiet down. .turn that thing on.
DR. COPPER: Now hold him.
MACREADY: I'm a real light sleeper, Childs.
DR. COPPER: Enough, MacReady!
DR. COPPER: Again. More current this time, And if anyone tries to wake me.
MACREADY: And if anyone tries to wake me.
DR. COPPER: Damn you, MacReady!
SANCHEZ: God. what.?
MACREADY: Get out of the way!!
CLARK: What you got in mind, MacReady?
MACREADY: A little test.
PALMER: What kind of test?
MACREADY: I'm sure a lot of you already know.
MACREADY: Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down. Real tight.
CHILDS: What for?
MACREADY: For your health.
GARRY: ( to others ) Let's rush him. He's not going to blow us all up.
MACREADY: Damn if I won't.
CHILDS: ( a beat ) You ain't tying me up.
MACREADY: Then I'll have to kill you.
CHILDS: Then kill me.
MACREADY: I mean it.
CHILDS: I guess you do.
THE MEN: being tied securely to couches and chairs.
MACREADY: Tie up Clark, too.
PALMER: ( bemused ) He's dead.
MACREADY: Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
CHILDS: ( muttering ) We should have jumped his ass.
MACREADY: Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
MACREADY: We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
NAULS: What are you going to do? Drink it?
MACREADY: Watching Norris in there. gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole. Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself. When a man bleeds it's just tissue. But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life. When attacked, your blood will try and survive and crawl away from a hot needle say.
SANCHEZ: grimacing as Dr. Copper pinches a scalpel to his thumb and collects a small portion of his blood in a dish. All the men have been tied up. Palmer, Childs and Garry on the small couch. The others, including the lifeless corpse of Clark, in chairs. Copper returns the plate to the table and sets it down in line with the other plates of blood that he has collected. The names of each man have been scribbled onto the plates. MacReady slides the Doctor a fresh plate.
MACREADY: Now you.
MACREADY: Slide it back here.
MACREADY: Now step way back.
MACREADY: I guess you're okay.
DR. COPPER: ( shaken, facetious ) Thank you.
MACREADY: I didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
MACREADY: Watch them.
MACREADY: Now I'll show you what I already
CHILDS: Load of bullshit.
MACREADY: We'll see. Let's try Clark.
CHILDS: So Clark was human, huh?
CHILDS: So that make you a murderer.
MACREADY: Palmer now.
GARRY: Pure nonsense. This won't prove a damn thing.
MACREADY: Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma. .we'll do you last.
MACREADY: It's all happened too fast. Copper tries to get off a burst of flame. The ever-changing Palmer breaks his bonds and leaps on the Doctor. The others sit helpless, struggling at their bindings. MacReady dives on Palmer's back and the three go rolling to the floor. Screeching. Crackling. MacReady pounds viciously at Palmer's head. A powerful, shirt-splitting arm sends him skidding across the floor. Copper momentarily has control of the torch. Just as he positions it, Palmer's mouth splits from his chin to his forehead and engulfs the entirety of the Doctor's head. The big torch slaps against the wall. Palmer bounds to his feet, wrapping his arms around the dangling, struggling body of Dr. Copper. The men are screaming hysterically. MacReady tries to fire up the bruised torch. Busted. Won't work. Frustrated, he charges up behind Palmer and begins hammering the thick steel instrument over his head. The shirt of Palmer's back erupts in MacReady's face. Splitting and ripping wildly, exposing the beginnings of yet another orifice. A blackened, iron-strong tongue lunges outward. Stunned, MacReady manages to elude it, diving for the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite. MacReady lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the table. Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep on balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice, spitting and snarling as it continues to take form. MacReady waits until Palmer's back spins around, facing him. Only two yards away, MacReady flings his lit roll into the ever-evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering Childs and Garry with his body. A muffled boom, as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep within Palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the room. MacReady rolls away from Childs and Garry as fast as he can.
MACREADY: perspiring profusely, his hand trembling slightly, prepares to continue the test. He heats the wire. The men are pouring sweat, white-knuckled. One of the smaller torches is pointed at Nauls. He closes his eyes. MacReady places the heated wire into his plate. Hiss. MacReady exhales. Nauls opens his eyes. MacReady unties Nauls with one hand, while the torch stays glued to the others. MacReady heats the wire once again. Both he and Nauls have torches aimed at Sanchez. Sanchez is near tears. The wire is dipped into the plate. Hisssss. Sanchez breaks down and sobs.
CHILDS: sits stoicly, while he watches the preparations for his turn.
CHILDS: Let's do it, Bwana.
CHILDS: ALL EYES snap towards station manager Garry. Childs, suddenly realizing who he is sitting next to, squirms.
ALL EYES: snap towards station manager Garry. Childs, suddenly realizing who he is sitting next to, squirms.
CHILDS: Get me. get me the hell away from. cut me loose, damn it!
GARRY: stares grimly ahead. Childs soaks his clothing with a can of gasoline. He is then surrounded. The room tenses, adrenalin pumps, breathing halts. The burner. The torches. The wire. The plate. Garry's face. MacReady tries again. Hiss. The men breathe. Their torches are lowered. Nauls throws his on the floor. Sanchez and Childs flop down in chairs. MacReady wipes his A long silence. Sanchez weeps quietly with relief.
GARRY: I know you gentlemen have been through a lot. But when you find the time. I'd rather not spend the rest of the winter tied to this couch. Shut the damn hell up.
NAULS: Shut the damn hell up.
MACREADY: ( almost a whisper )
BLAIR'S SHACK: The door is wide open. They pause by the entrance, trying to balance against the wind. They enter.
NAULS: What is it?
MACREADY: Everything that's been missing.
CHILDS: Spaceship of some kind.
MACREADY: Smart S.O.B. He put it together piece by piece.
NAULS: Where was he trying to go?
MACREADY: Anyplace but here.
MACREADY: But he ain't going to make it.
NAULS: What about Childs?
MACREADY: Forget about Childs. He's over.
GARRY: Make 'em short. They'll go off quicker if we need to use them.
SANCHEZ: What if it doesn't come?
MACREADY: It'll come. It needs us. We're the only thing left to imitate. Give me a hand.
MACREADY: ( to Sanchez ) You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
NAULS: ( protest ) You crazy? He might be inside already?
MACREADY: Chance we got to take. We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
SANCHEZ: He might just wait us out.
MACREADY: I'm going to blow the generator when you get back. He'll have to come for us or freeze.
MACREADY: We've got portable heaters we'll last longer.
MACREADY: .Hold it.
MACREADY: Sodium cyanide. We place them between our cheeks and gums. This Thing can't imitate anything that's dead.
MACREADY: If it gets a hold of you bite down. They're supposed to be fast and painless. Now move.
MACREADY: Looks good.
GARRY: One thousand volts. Should be enough.
SANCHEZ: You hear that?
NAULS: Hear what?
NAULS: It's got into the pub! It's turned on the stereo!
SANCHEZ: It's in between us and them!! How we going to get back?!
NAULS: It's in between us and them!! How we going to get back?!
SANCHEZ: I can't hear you.
MACREADY: What are they doing out there?! What's he saying?
GARRY: What's he saying?
NAULS: MacReady! We been cut off!!
MACREADY: Got to get to the generator.
NAULS: full speed down the maze. Left. Right. Totally reckless. He hits a straightaway.
SANCHEZ'S BODY: from out of nowhere, blasts through the hallway wall, directly in Nauls' path. A thick arm pins the body to the other side. Unable to stop, Nauls skids out of control, banging into the sides of the wall, his cyanide capsule flying out of his Whatever the rest of it is, it starts to crumble through the wall. Nauls dives over the arm, somersaults to his feet and takes off.
NAULS: Get back!!
MACREADY: The generator!
NAULS: Screw the generator!!
NAULS: Got Sanchez. World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker. Can go through walls. And it's like all over the place.
MACREADY: Calm down and get in your position.
NAULS: Position, my ass.
GARRY: I'm going to bump this up, much as I Boulder Dam might do it.
NAULS: Boulder Dam might do it.
GARRY: How long's it been?
MACREADY: Little over two hours.
NAULS: Maybe it ain't coming.
MACREADY: Then we go after him.
NAULS: Bet the last place you ever go.
MACREADY: The door begins to pound from the outside. Nauls and MacReady light two cocktails each. The door booms. The room's foundations shake. The ceiling quivers. The gas bombs are cocked. From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst. Stunned, the men stumble back. MacReady throws his gas bomb. Nauls the same. For a moment it stands silhouetted in flame. Enormous. Garry bolts for the main door. The Thing's tongue spirals from his mouth and spears him. The good two-thirds of its body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door. Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground. MacReady dodges still another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the The current rips through the door. Garry dies instantly. One of The Thing's talons, still caught in the door, sends it writhing in pain. It literally rips the door from its latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it loose.
