"TOY STORY": Original Story by Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow
FINAL DRAFT: November 1995
"TOY STORY": FADE IN: INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM A row of moving boxes lie on the floor of the room. They are drawn up in crayon to look like a miniature Western town. The bedroom is lined with cloud wallpaper giving the impression of sky. One of the boxes has a children's illustrated "WANTED" poster of a Mr. Potato Head taped to it. A MR. POTATO HEAD DOLL is set in front of the poster. The VOICE OVER of ANDY, a 6-year-old boy, can be heard acting out all the voices of the scene.
ANDY: ( pulling Woody's string ) You saved the day again, Woody.
BEGIN TITLES: SONG "YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME" plays while Andy does various activities with Woody: Andy turns the Western town boxes around to reveal cows drawn on the other side. He grabs a jump rope and pretends Woody is lassoing the cattle.
ANDY: C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.
ANDY: ( raising his arms )
SONG ENDS: Woody lies limp on the sofa while Andy is heard talking to his mother.
ANDY: Can we leave this up 'til we move?
MRS. DAVIS: Well, sure, we can leave it up.
ANDY: MRS. DAVIS
MRS. DAVIS: Now go get Molly. Your friends are going to be here any minute.
ANDY: Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs.
ANDY: It's party time, Woody!
ANDY: Howdy, Little Lady! Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.
ANDY: ( picking up Molly ) C'mon, Molly. Oh, you're getting ( to Woody ) See ya later, Woody.
END TITLES: Woody's eyes come to life. The cowboy doll sits up, his expression changing from a smile to worry.

SLINKY: Oh.well alright, you can be red if you want.
WOODY: Not now, Slink. I've got some bad Bad news?!
SLINKY: Bad news?!
WOODY: Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys in the room are watching. He leans in close to Slinky.

REX: I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it. I think I'm just coming off as annoying.
WOODY: ( choking ) Aach! Oh, hi, Bo.
BO PEEP: I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
WOODY: ( blushing ) Oh, hey - it was nothing.
BO PEEP: Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?

HAMM: Moving buddy?! You can't be serious!
REX: Well I didn't know we were supposed to have one already.

A moving buddy if you don't have one, get Alright, next.uh.oh, yes.

WOODY: Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move. I'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried.
SLINKY: Hey, hey! Come on, Potato Head! If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darnit, it's good enough for me. Woody has never steered us wrong before.
WOODY: C'mon, guys! Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
REX: But what if Andy gets another dinosaur? A mean one? I just don't think I can take that kind of Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. This is Andy we're talking about.
WOODY: Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. This is Andy we're talking about.
WOODY: ( continued ) It doesn't matter how much we're played with. What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us. That's what we're made for.
HAMM: Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
WOODY: Stay calm, everyone!!
WOODY: Uh, meeting adjourned.
HAMM: Oh, boy. Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
HAMM: Yessir, we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure.

REX: They're getting bigger.
SLINKY: Wait! There's a nice little one over there!
MR. SPELL: Spell the word "trashcan."

REX: Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
WOODY: Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best. C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
WOUNDED SOLDIER: ( moans ) Go on without me. Just go!
SLINKY: A good soldier never leaves a man
A BALL: bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps and kid clamor. The Sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant, right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor. They conceal themselves in the house plant just before the children run by.
WOODY: This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet, quiet!
WOODY: A lunchbox?!
SLINKY: For lunch. Heh heh heh.
MRS. DAVIS: Oh, only one left.
WOODY: Last present!

ANDY: and you press his back and he does a karate-chop action!
ANDY: Oh, yeah!
BEAT: The toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed.
BO PEEP: Can you see it?
SLINKY: What the heck is up there?
REX: Woody? Who's up there with you?
SLINKY: Woody, what are you doing under the Uh-h-h-h.nothing! Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all. Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose. It's just a mistake.
WOODY: ( composing himself ) Uh-h-h-h.nothing! Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all. Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose. It's just a mistake.
REX: ( GASP! ) Have you been replaced?
WOODY: Hey! What did I tell you earlier? No one is getting replaced.
WOODY: Now let's all be polite, and give whatever it is up there a nice, big "Andy's Room" welcome.
BUZZ LIGHTYEAR: We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head to toe. The imposing "G.I. Joe-sized" doll stands heroically in the center of the bed, his back to Woody. Woody GULPS. Buzz comes alive and looks around.
BUZZ: Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. Come in, Star Command.
BUZZ: Star Command - come in. Do you read me? Why don't they answer?!!
BUZZ: ( GASP ) My ship!!
BUZZ: Blast! This'll take weeks to repair!
BUZZ: Buzz Lightyear Mission Log. Stardate 4072: My ship has run off course en route to sector 12. I've crash landed on a strange planet. The impact must have awoken me from
BUZZ: ( into communicator ) Terrain seems a bit unstable.
BUZZ: ( into communicator ) No read-out yet if the air is breathable. and there seems to be no sign of intelligent life
WOODY: Buzz jumps back, taking a fighting stance. He presses a button on his arm that turns on a red "laser beam" light on his wrist. Buzz aims the red beam on Woody's forehead and holds it there.

WOODY: Aaaaaaah! Whoa, hey, whoa, did I frighten you? Didn't mean to. Sorry. Howdy! My name is Woody and this is Andy's room. That's all I wanted to say, and also, there has been a bit of a mix-up. This is my spot, see, the bed here
BUZZ: ( de-activating his laser beam ) Local law enforcement! It's about time you got here. I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit. My ship has crash landed here by mistake.
WOODY: Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
BUZZ: I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
WOODY: Well, let's see, we've got double Watch yourself!! Halt! Who goes there?!
BUZZ: Watch yourself!! Halt! Who goes there?!
BUZZ: ( continued ) Halt! Who goes there?!
REX: Don't shoot! It's okay! Friends!
BUZZ: ( to Woody ) Do you know these life forms?
WOODY: Yes. They're Andy's toys.
BUZZ: Alright, everyone. You're clear to come up.
BUZZ: I am Buzz Lightyear. I come in peace.

BUZZ: Why, thank you. Now thank you all for your kind Say! What's that button do?
REX: Say! What's that button do?
BUZZ: I'll show you.
SLINKY: Hey, Woody's got something like that. His is a pullstring, only Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
HAMM: Oh yeah, but not like this one. This is a quality sound system. Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, uh, where are you from? Singapore? Hong Kong?
BUZZ: Well.no, actually I'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4. As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.
REX: And I'm from Mattel. Well, I'm not actually from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but.
WOODY: You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
BO PEEP: Well sure, look at him. He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
BUZZ: Ah, ah, ah, please be careful! You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.
WOODY: It's not a laser! It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
HAMM: What's with him?
WOODY: All right, that's enough. Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy
BUZZ: T-O-Y. Toy.
WOODY: T-O-Y. Toy.
BUZZ: Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
WOODY: The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
REX: Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear? Now I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do?
WOODY: He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly
BUZZ: Excuse me.
HAMM: Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good!
WOODY: Oh, what?!.What?! These are plastic. He can't fly!
BUZZ: They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
WOODY: No, you can't.
BUZZ: Yes, I can.
WOODY: You can't!
BUZZ: Can't! Can't! Can't!
WOODY: Can't! Can't! Can't!
BUZZ: I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
WOODY: Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it.
BUZZ: All right, then, I will. Stand back everyone!
BUZZ: To infinity and beyond!!
BUZZ: The crowd of toys rush Buzz, CHEERING AND CLAPPING WITH
REX: Whoa! Oh, wow! You flew I found my moving buddy!
BO PEEP: I found my moving buddy!
BUZZ: Why, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.
WOODY: That wasn't flying! That was falling with style!
SLINKY: Heh, heh, heh! Golly bob howdy
WOODY: Oh, shut up! In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. They'll see. they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
MONTAGE: SONG: STRANGE THINGS plays over montage.
ANDY: Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
BLACK: END MONTAGE/SONG ENDS The black screen splits horizontally to become.
WOODY: He takes a couple DEEP BREATHS of fresh air, then discovers that his hat is missing.
WOODY: ( looking back into the toy box ) Hey! Who's got my hat?
SHARK: Look, I'm Woody. Howdy, howdy, howdy!
WOODY: ( sarcastic ) Ah-hah! Ah-hah-hah! ( grabs the hat ) Give me that!
BUZZ: ( continued ) Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me.
REX: With permanent ink, too!
BUZZ: Well, I must get back to repairing my ship.
WOODY: ( nonchalant ) Uh, let what? I don't Uh, what do you mean? Who?
BO PEEP: I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
WOODY: Alright! That's it!
BUZZ: Unidirectional bonding strip. Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!
ROBOT: Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!
WOODY: Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
BUZZ: What are you talking about? Where's that bonding strip?!
WOODY: And another thing. Stop with this spaceman thing. It's getting on my Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command?
BUZZ: Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command?
WOODY: Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
BUZZ: Don't even think about it, cowboy!
WOODY: Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
BUZZ: The air isn't toxic.
BUZZ: How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet! My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!
WOODY: You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act! Hey, guys! Look! It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
BUZZ: You're mocking me, aren't you?
WOODY: Oh, no, no, no. Buzz, look! An alien!
BUZZ: Buzz falls for the trick and turns around. Woody kneels over with LAUGHTER.
WOODY: Slinky hides under the bed.
SLINKY: It's Sid!
REX: I thought he was at summer camp!
HAMM: They must have kicked him out early this year.
REX: Oh, no! Not Sid!
WOODY: I can't tell. Hey, where's Lenny?
REX: Oh, no. I can't bear to watch one of these again!
WOODY: Oh, no.it's a Combat Carl.
BUZZ: What's going on?
WOODY: Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
BUZZ: I'd better take a look anyway.
BUZZ: Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
WOODY: ( redirecting Buzz's view ) That's why. Sid.
BUZZ: Sure is a hairy fellah.
WOODY: No! No, that's Scud, you idiot!
WOODY: THAT is Sid!
BUZZ: You mean that happy child?
REX: He tortures toys just for fun.
BUZZ: Well, then we've got to do something!
BO PEEP: What are you doing?!! Get down from there!
BUZZ: I'm going to go teach that boy a Yeah, sure. You go ahead. Melt him with your scary laser.
WOODY: Yeah, sure. You go ahead. Melt him with your scary laser.
BUZZ: Be careful with that, it's extremely dangerous.
LENNY: He's lighting it! He's lighting it!
LENNY: Hit the dirt!
BUZZ: I could have stopped him.
WOODY: Buzz, I would love to see you try. 'Course I'd love to see you as a
BO PEEP: The sooner we move the better.
ANDY: To infinity and beyond!
MRS. DAVIS: Oh, all this packing makes me hungry. What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
ANDY: Pizza Planet?! Oh, cool!
MRS. DAVIS: Go wash your hands and I'll get Molly ready.

WOODY: Don't count on it?!! Doh-h-h-h!
WOODY: Buzz!! Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
BUZZ: ( looking around ) ( pointing to the back of the desk ) Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy.it's.it's trapped, Then we've no time to lose!!
WOODY: ( pointing to the back of the desk ) Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy.it's.it's trapped, Then we've no time to lose!!
BUZZ: Then we've no time to lose!!
BUZZ: I don't see anything!
WOODY: Oh, he's there. Just, just keep
BUZZ: What kind of a toy ?
POTATO HEAD: sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with Hamm. He looks up at the desk and GASPS as the bulletin board slams down onto.
A GLOBE: knocking it out of its stand. The globe starts rolling right at Buzz. Woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created. Buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behind him, Indiana Jones style. Buzz gets stuck "log rolling" on a pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of the way onto the window ledge. The globe lumbers past Buzz and strikes a Luxo-style desklamp. The arm of the lamp swings all the way around, barely missing Woody. .and knocks Buzz out the window.
TOYS: Woody looks out the window. No sign of Buzz. All the other toys rush over to the sill.
BUZZ!!!!: Woody looks out the window. No sign of Buzz. All the other toys rush over to the sill.
WOODY: Woody looks out the window. No sign of Buzz. All the other toys rush over to the sill.
SLINKY: I don't see him in the driveway! I think he bounced into Sid's yard.
REX: ( GASP ) ( electric motor sounds ) Whirrr!! Whirrrr-whirrrr!!!
RC CAR: ( electric motor sounds ) Whirrr!! Whirrrr-whirrrr!!!
REX: Hey everyone! RC's trying to say
REX: ( leaning down close to RC ) What is it, boy?
RC CAR: ( electric motor sounds ) Whirrr!!! Whirrr! Whirrrrrr!!
TOYS: BO PEEP
BO PEEP: What do you mean?
TOYS: The toys turn to Woody who suddenly realizes how this looks.
WHAT?!?: The toys turn to Woody who suddenly realizes how this looks.
WOODY: Wait a minute. You you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
WOODY: Now, it was an accident! Guys, c'mon now, you.you gotta believe me
SLINKY: We believe you, Woody. Right, Rex?
REX: ( backing away ) Oh, I don't like confrontations.
SARGENT: Where is your honor, dirtbag?! You are an absolute disgrace! You don't deserve to
HAMM: I don't think we should give him the chance.
SARGENT: There he is, men! Frag him!
HAMM: I got dibs on his hat!
BO PEEP: Would you boys stop it?!
HAMM: Tackle him!
WOODY: No, no, no, no! Wait! Wait I can explain everything
SARGENT: The toys all drop Woody and rush back to their places. Andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where Woody is lying. Andy overlooks Woody and begins searching around the room.
ANDY: Mom! Do you know where Buzz is?
ANDY: But Mom, I can't find him!
ANDY: He grabs Woody and walks out of the room.
ANDY: I couldn't find my Buzz. I know I left him right there.
MRS. DAVIS: Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
A BUSH: next to the van begins to rustle. Hands part the foliage, revealing Buzz. He eyes Woody going into the van and does a slow burn. The van ENGINE STARTS UP. Buzz races out of the bush, and with a mighty leap, grabs the rear fender of the van as it pulls out of the driveway.
SLINKY: It's too short! We need more monkeys!
REX: ( holding up an empty barrel ) There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel.
REX: ( yelling out window ) Buzz! The monkeys aren't working! We're formulating another plan! Stay calm! ( beat ) Oh, where could he be?
ANDY: Can I help pump the gas?
MRS. DAVIS: Sure! I'll even let you drive.
WOODY: Oh, great. How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?
WOODY: Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody. He is furious.
WOODY: Buzz! You're alive! This is great! Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved! Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake. Huh?
WOODY: ( weakly ) Right? Buddy?
BUZZ: I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
WOODY: Oh. Oh, that's good.
BUZZ: ( getting in Woody's face ) But we're not on my planet, are we?
WOODY: Buzz lunges for Woody. The two toys fly off the seat and out the open side door of the van.
WOODY: Ok! Come on! You want a piece of
WOODY: Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activating BUZZ'S SAMPLED VOICE buttons.
WOODY: ( GASP )
WOODY: Doesn't he realize that I'm not I'm LOST! Oh, I'm a lost toy!
BUZZ: Buzz Lightyear Mission Log. The local Sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refueling station of some
WOODY: SFX: LOUD TRUCK HORN Just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station. Buzz dives off to the side while Woody collapses right where he stands on the pavement. The truck ROARS over him.
BUZZ: ( into wrist communicator ) According to my nava-computer, the
WOODY: ( whispering ) Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot!!
BUZZ: Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
WOODY: This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
BUZZ: My fault?! If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first Oh, yeah? Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
WOODY: Oh, yeah? Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
BUZZ: Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
WOODY: ( incredulous ) WHAT?!! What are you talking about?! Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet. I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness. ( pointing at Woody ) And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendez-vous with Star Command.

BUZZ: ( continuing to walk away ) Go away.
WOODY: No, Buzz, you've gotta come back. I found a spaceship!
WOODY: It's a spaceship, Buzz!
BUZZ: Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
WOODY: Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you.home.
BUZZ: Well, then let's climb abroad.
WOODY: No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back. No one will see us there.
BUZZ: Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
WOODY: ( loud whisper ) Yeah, but, Buzz! Buzz!
WOODY: ( loud whisper )
WOODY: It'll be safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay. What an idiot!
BAM!!!: CUT TO:
ROBOT GUARDS: You are clear to enter. Welcome to Pizza Planet.

WOODY: ( using straw as periscope ) Ow! Watch where you're going!
BUZZ: ( mouthing with burger box )
THE ARCADE: The space-themed arena is filled with hordes of children playing video games. A sea of HI-TECH SOUNDS and lights overwhelm the place. Buzz is beaming with hope.
BUZZ: What a space port. Good work, Woody.
ANDY: standing with Mom and Molly in her stroller.
WOODY: ( to himself ) What's Black Hole?
MRS. DAVIS: What's Black Hole?
ANDY: Oh, it's so cool.
BUZZ: Now we need to find a ship that's headed for Sector 12
WOODY: Wait a minute! No Buzz! This way! There's a special ship. I just saw You mean it has hyperdrive?
BUZZ: You mean it has hyperdrive?
WOODY: Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro.uh, turf.

WOODY: Alright Buzz, get ready.
WOODY: Okay, Buzz, when I say "go," we're gonna jump in the basket
WOODY: ( loud whisper )
WOODY: Dooh! No! This cannot be happening to me!!
ALIEN #1: ( excited ) A stranger!
ALIEN #2: From the outside!
ALIENS: Greetings! I am Buzz Lightyear! I come in peace!
BUZZ: Greetings! I am Buzz Lightyear! I come in peace!
ALIENS: Tell us! What is it like outside?
BUZZ: ( continued; to the aliens ) Who's in charge here?
ALIENS: The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!!
ALIEN #1: The claw is our master.
ALIEN #2: The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.
WOODY: ( to himself ) This is ludicrous.
WOODY: Oh, no! Sid!!!
WOODY: Get down!!
BUZZ: ( loud whisper ) What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I ( loud whisper ) YOU are the one that decided to climb into this
WOODY: ( loud whisper ) YOU are the one that decided to climb into this
ALIEN #4: ( loud whisper ) Sh-h-h-h-h-h. The claw. It moves.
ALIEN #3: ( whispering excitedly ) I have been chosen!!
ALIEN #3: ( continued ) Farewell, my friends! I go on to a better place.
SID: With the alien gone, Buzz's upper torso becomes exposed, forcing the space ranger to freeze. Sid suddenly spots Buzz.
SID: A Buzz Lightyear! No way!
SID: The claw begins to lift Buzz up.
WOODY: ( GASP ) Buzz, NO!
SID: ( slamming his fist against the glass ) Wha ? Hey!!
ALIEN #4: He has been chosen.
WOODY: Hey! What are you doing?
ALIEN #5: He must go.
WOODY: Stop it, you ! Stop it, you He must go! Do not fight the claw! Do not anger the claw! He has been

SID: Alright! Double prizes!
SID: ( looking at his two new toys ) Let's go home and.play. Ha-ha-ha.
BUZZ: Sheriff! I can see your dwelling from here! You're almost home.
ALIEN: Nirvana is coming! The mystic portal awaits!
WOODY: ( to Alien ) Will you be quiet?!! ( to both ) You guys don't get it, do you? Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out.
SID: Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy. Sit! Good
SID: Hey, I got somethin' for ya, boy.
WOODY: ( loud whisper )
FREEZE!!!: The toys go still. Sid's hand grabs the alien out of the backpack. The alien is then placed sideways along Scud's In one quick motion, Scud flips the alien up, catches it in his mouth, and rabidly shakes it back and forth. Buzz and Woody react in horror.
SID: Ready, set, NOW.
SID: Hannah! Hey, Hannah!!!
HANNAH: Did I get my package in the mail?
SID: Did I get my package in the mail?
HANNAH: I dunno.
SID: Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
HANNAH: ( insistent ) I don't know!
SID: ( mock concern ) Oh no, Hannah!
HANNAH: Look! Janie!
SID: Look! Janie!
HANNAH: She's sick!
SID: She's sick!
HANNAH: ( panic rising ) No she's NOT
SID: I'll have to perform one of NO-O-O. Don't touch her! NO!
HANNAH: NO-O-O. Don't touch her! NO!
WOODY: Not Sid's room.not there.
HANNAH: Sid! Give her back!
SID: ( as Doctor ) Oh, no. We have a sick patient here, nurse. Prepare the O.R., STAT!
SID: ( as Doctor ) Patient is. ( straining while tightening vise )
SID: ( as Doctor ) No one's ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before.
SID: ( as Doctor ) Now for the tricky part pliers!
BUZZ: ( whispering to Woody ) I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school.
SID: ( as Nurse ) Doctor, you've done it! ( running to the door )
SID: ( continued ) Janie's all better now.
HANNAH: MOM!! MOM!! She's lying! Whatever she says it's not true!
SID: She's lying! Whatever she says it's not true!
WOODY: We are gonna die. I'm outta here!
WOODY: Locked! There's gotta be another way out of here.
WOODY: Uh.Buzz? Was that you?
WOODY: Hey! Hi, there, little fellah! Come out here. Do you know a way out of here?
WOODY: ( GASP!! )
WOODY: Buzz and Woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as they grab all the Janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging them off into the shadows.
BUZZ: They're cannibals!
BUZZ: May day! May day! Come in, Star Command! Send reinforcements!. Star Command, do you copy?
BUZZ: ( aiming his arm out the pack ) I've set my laser from stun to kill.
WOODY: Oh, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
REX: Hey, you guys! I think I've found him. Buzz! Is that you?!
REX: Whiskers! Will you get out of here?! You're interfering with the search and rescue.
REX: ( whispering ) Look! They're home!
ANDY: Mom, have you seen Woody?
MRS. DAVIS: Where was the last place you left him?
ANDY: ( searching the van ) Right here in the van.
MRS. DAVIS: Oh, I'm sure he's there. You're just not looking hard enough.
ANDY: He's not here, Mom. Woody's gone.
BO PEEP: ( GASP ) Woody's gone?!
HAMM: Well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran
REX: Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?! Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay.
BO PEEP: Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay.
SID: ( as Interrogator ) I can see your will is strong.
SID: ( continued ) Well, we have ways of making you talk.
SID: ( as Interrogator ) Where are your rebel friends now? Heh, heh.
SID: Sid runs out of the room. As soon as he's gone, Woody jumps up SCREAMING, his forehead burning. He runs to a bowl of half-eaten cereal ( with milk ) on the floor, and dunks his head in. Buzz runs over to Woody, pausing to remove two suction cup darts from his person before pulling Woody out of the bowl. Two colorful Froot-Loops stick to each of Woody's eyes like Woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cereal spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead.
BUZZ: Are you alright? I'm proud of you, Sheriff. A lesser man would have talked under such torture.
WOODY: I sure hope this isn't permanent.
BUZZ: ( checking his wrist communicator ) Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the
WOODY: The door! It's open! We're free!!
BUZZ: Woody, we don't know what's out there!
WOODY: I'll tell you what's AAAAH!
WOODY: They're gonna eat us, Buzz!! Do something! Quick!
BUZZ: Shield your eyes!
BUZZ: It's not working. I recharged it before I left. It should be good for hours
WOODY: Oh, you idiot! You're a toy! Use your karate chop action!
WOODY: ( to mutants ) Get away! Hoo-cha! Hoo-cha!
BUZZ: Hey!! Hey! How are you doing that? Stop that!
WOODY: Back! Back, you savages! Back!
BUZZ: Woody, stop it!!
WOODY: Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
WOODY: ( to himself ) There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home.
SCUD: asleep on the landing. Woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast. He slowly backs up the stairs. Suddenly Buzz appears and pulls Woody back against the hallway wall. He covers Woody's mouth with his hand.
WOODY: ( muffled gasp )
BUZZ: ( whisper ) Another stunt like that, cowboy you're going to get us killed.
WOODY: ( pulling Buzz's hand away ) Don't tell me what to do!
BUZZ: Buzz checks to make sure Scud is still asleep and then darts across the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway. Once safely across, he motions for Woody to follow. Woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area and meets up with Buzz. As he stands.
BUZZ: Split up!
A CLOSET: Woody slams the door shut just as Scud reaches the top of the landing. CRASHED can be heard from behind the closet door, getting Scud's attention. Buzz peeks out from his doorway at Scud SNIFFING AND GROWLING at the closet. Sensing movement behind him, Scud whips around and starts to enter Buzz's doorway.
BUZZ: Star Command!
SPACE COMMANDER: Buzz Lightyear, Planet Earth needs your help!
KID #1: ( into toy wrist communicator ) On the way!
BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!!!: Buzz reacts with confusion at what he is watching. He walks slowly towards the television set.
KID #1: Calling Buzz Lightyear.
KID #2: With every feature demonstrated on the TV, Buzz compares the same feature on himself.
KID #2: Total annihilation!
TV BUZZ: To Infinity and Beyond!
BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!!!: The image on the screen changes to a shot of hundreds of Buzzes in their boxes lining either side of a store aisle.
IN TAIWAN.": SONG: "I WILL GO SAILING NO MORE" BEGINS INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway. As he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look up through the railing at.
BEAT: Slowly Buzz raises his head, determination in his eyes. He slams the offending wrist communicator shut, as if to deny its message of "Made in Taiwan." Buzz climbs up the railing to the banister. He pops open his wings, and aims himself towards the window above.
BUZZ: To Infinity and Beyond!
SONG ENDS: HANNAH ( O.S. )
HANNAH: DISSOLVE TO:
WOODY: ( to the hallway ) Buzz?! The coast is clear. Buzz? Where are you?
BUZZ: He is seated at the miniature table, dressed up in a frilly apron and fashionable party hat.
HANNAH: ( continued ) Would you like some tea, Mrs. Nesbit?
WOODY: ( under his breath )
HANNAH: It's so nice you could join us on such late notice.
WOODY: Oh, no!
HANNAH: What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbit. It goes quite well with your head.
WOODY: ( high voice ) Hannah! Oh, Hannah!
HANNAH: ( yelling out her room ) ( to the dolls ) Please excuse me, ladies. I'll be right back.
HANNAH: What is it, Mom? Mom, where are you?
WOODY: Buzz! Hey, Buzz! Are you okay?
BUZZ: Gone! It's all go-o-one! All of it's gone. Bye-bye! Whoo-hoo! See ya!
WOODY: What happened to you?
BUZZ: One minute you're defending the whole galaxy. .and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
WOODY: I think you've had enough tea for Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
BUZZ: ( grabbing Woody ) Don't you get it?! You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! ( hysterical laughter )
WOODY: Snap out of it, Buzz!
BUZZ: ( sober ) I'm sorry. You're right.
BUZZ: ( continued ) .I'm just a little depressed, that's all. I can get through this.
BUZZ: Oh, I'm a sham!!
WOODY: ( loud whisper ) Sh-h-h-h-h!! Quiet, Buzz.
BUZZ: Look at me! I can't even fly out of a window!
BUZZ: ( continued ) But the hat looked good. Tell me the hat looked good! The apron is a bit much, it's not my color.
WOODY: Out the window.Buzz, you're a
WOODY: ( continued ) Come on, this way!
BUZZ: Years of Academy training.wasted!!
HAMM: Miss. G-6.
HAMM: MR. POTATO HEAD
HAMM: Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
HAMM: No, no, not the ear. Gimme the nose. C'mon!
HAMM: He's in the psycho's bedroom!
WOODY: ( into Andy's bedroom ) Everyone, it's Woody!
HAMM: ( into Andy's bedroom ) Everyone, it's Woody!
BO PEEP: You're kidding?
REX: You're kidding?
SLINKY: INT. SID'S ROOM Buzz is not there. Woody looks down at the floor. Buzz is sitting on the floor, playing "bombs away" with his broken arm.
WOODY: We're gonna get outta here, Buzz
REX: Hey, look!
BO PEEP: Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
WOODY: Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
SLINKY: I knew you'd come back, Woody!
BO PEEP: What are you doing over there?
WOODY: It's a long story, Bo. I'll explain later. Here, catch this!
SLINKY: I got it, Woody!
REX: ( overly excited ) He got it, Woody!
WOODY: Good going, Slink! Now, just, just tie it on to something!
SLINKY: BO PEEP
BO PEEP: Potato Head!?
WOODY: No, no, no! You got it all wrong, Potato Head. Buzz is fine! Buzz is right here. He's with me!
WOODY: No, I'm not! Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not Just a sec.
WOODY: ( to Andy's toys ) Just a sec.
WOODY: Buzz! Will you get up here and give me a hand?!
WOODY: ( insincerely ) Ha ha. That's very funny, Buzz. ( exploding ) This is serious!!
WOODY: ( forced casualness ) Oh, hi Buzz! Why don't you say "hello" to the guys over there?
REX: Hey look! It's Buzz!
WOODY: ( shaking the arm's hand ) Yeah, hey Buzz. Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake. Gimme five, man!
HAMM: Something's screwy here.
WOODY: So, you see? We're friends now, guys. Aren't we, Buzz? You bet. Gimme a hug.
WOODY: ( continued; as himself ) Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
SLINKY: See? It is Buzz. Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
WOODY: Woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up. .exposing the severed arm. The toys all SCREAM in horror. Rex clasps his hands to his mouth and turns away to BARF. Realizing his mistake, Woody tries to hide the arm, but it's too late.
HAMM: Oh, that is disgusting.
WOODY: No! No, no, no, no!
WOODY: No, it's not what you think, I swear!
WOODY: No! No! Don't leave! Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please! You don't know what it's like over here!
HAMM: Go back to your lives, citizens. Show's over.
WOODY: Come back! Slink! Slink, please! Please! Listen to me!
WOODY: ( continued ) No! No! Come back! SLI-I-I-INKYYY!!
WOODY: Still holding onto Buzz's arm, Woody jumps down from the desk and runs to Buzz's rescue.
BUZZ!!: Still holding onto Buzz's arm, Woody jumps down from the desk and runs to Buzz's rescue.
WOODY: Go away, you disgusting freaks!
WOODY: Alright back! Back, you cannibals!
WOODY: He is still alive, and you're not gonna get him, you monsters!
BUZZ: He is sitting up, his broken arm now newly-attached. Woody's anger turns to confusion.
WOODY: Hey?! Hey, they fixed you!
WOODY: ( continued ) But but they're cannibals. We saw them eat those other toys.
WOODY: Uh.sorry. I.I thought that you were gonna. .you know, eat my friend.
WOODY: Hey! No, no, wait! Hey! What's Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
WOODY: FOOTSTEPS approach the bedroom. Woody tries to pick up the still depressed Buzz, but he just goes limp.
WOODY: Buzz! C'mon, get up! Buzz, .get up.
WOODY: Fine. Let Sid trash you. But don't blame me.
SID: It came! It finally came!
SID: ( reverently ) The big one.
SID: ( reading the rocket label ) "Extremely dangerous. Keep out of reach of children." COOL. ( looks around ) What am I gonna blow? Man.hey, where's that wimpy cowboy doll?
SID: Yes! I've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit. Ha-ha.
SID: Oh, no.
SID: Aw, man.!
SID: ( as Newscaster ) Sid Phillips reporting. Launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site. Tomorrow's forecast.
SID: Sunny. Ha-ha-ha. Sweet dreams.
MRS. DAVIS: I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
ANDY: ( groggy ) But what if we leave them behind?
MRS. DAVIS: Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
REX: ( relieved ) ( COUGH ) Will you quit moving around?!
REX: I'm sorry. It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
REX: ( following Potato Head ) Everyone else was picked.
BO PEEP: peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at Andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat.
BO PEEP: Oh, Woody, if only you could see how much Andy misses you.
WOODY: Ps-s-s-s-t! Psst! Hey, Buzz!
WOODY: Hey! Get over here and see if you can get this tool box off me.
WOODY: Oh, come on, Buzz. I.Buzz, I can't do this without you. I need your help.
BUZZ: I can't help. I can't help anyone.
WOODY: Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
BUZZ: Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference.
WOODY: Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
BUZZ: No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy.
WOODY: Whoa, hey wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
BUZZ: Yeah, right.
WOODY: No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY! You are HIS But why would Andy want me?
BUZZ: But why would Andy want me?
WOODY: Why would Andy want you?! Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear. Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that that whoosh thing you are a COOL toy.
WOODY: ( continued; depressed ) As a matter of fact you're too cool. I mean I mean what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure? All I can do is.
WOODY: Why would Andy ever want to play with me, when he's got you? I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.
WOODY: Listen Buzz, forget about me. You should get out of here while you can.
BUZZ: He is on top of the milkcrate, trying to push the tool box off.
WOODY: Buzz!! What are you doing? I thought you were
BUZZ: Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
WOODY: Yes Sir!
WOODY: ( strained ) Come on, Buzz! We can do it!
BUZZ: Woody! It's the moving van.
WOODY: We've got to get out of here.NOW. C'mon, Buzz.
WOODY: C'mon, Buzz.
WOODY: ( loud whisper ) Alright. Buzz! Hey! I'm out!
BUZZ: ( GRUNT ) ( GRUNT )
WOODY: ( nervous laugh ) ( in his sleep ) I wanna ride the pony.
SID: ( in his sleep ) I wanna ride the pony.
BUZZ: Woody! Woody?! Are you alright?!
WOODY: ( punch-drunk ) No, I'm fine.I'm okay.
SID: Oh, yeah! Time for lift-off!
SCUD: The dog barrels down the hallway straight for Woody.
WOODY: Aaah! Back! Back! Down! Down!
WOODY: ( out of breath; to himself ) Okay, what do I do? Come on Woody,
WOODY: The mutant toys all scatter and hide.
WOODY: No, no, no! Wait! Wait! Listen! Please! There's a good toy down there and he's he's going to be blown to bits in a few minutes all because of me. I've gotta save him! But I need your help.
WOODY: Please. He's my friend. He's the only one I've got.
WOODY: ( to Babyface ) Thank you. ( to the others ) Okay. I think I know what to do. We're going to have to break a few rules, but if it works, it'll help
SID: ( as Astronaut ) Houston to Mission Control. Come in, Control.
SID: ( continued ) Launch pad is being constructed!
WOODY: All right, listen up. I need Pump Boy here Ducky here. Legs?
WOODY: ( continued; to Legs ) You're with Ducky. ( to the others ) RollerBob and I don't move till we get the signal. Clear?
WOODY: Okay, let's move!
WOODY: Wind the frog!
WOODY: Wait for the signal.
WOODY: Hand-in-the-box throws open the door and The Frog is let loose. The Frog zips through Scud's legs and down the hallway. Scud chases after it and follows it down the stairs.
WOODY: Alright, let's go.
HANNAH: I'm coming! I'm coming!
THE FROG: zooms down the stairs with Scud BARKING right behind. The Frog leaps off the last step, speeds through Hannah's legs and out the open front door. Hannah looks back inside at Scud. In that moment, Ducky catches the Frog and is quickly reeled upwards back into the Scud bursts through Hannah's legs, knocking her over, and runs out onto the empty porch.
HANNAH: ( annoyed )
SCUD!!!: Scud suddenly realizes he's been duped, but before he can get back inside, Hannah slams the front door shut.
HANNAH: Stupid dog.
WOODY: Lean back!
WOODY: ( to toys in the bush ) Let's go!
BUZZ: ( loud whisper ) Woody?! Great! Help me out of this thing!
WOODY: ( loud whisper ) It's ok. Everything's under control.
BUZZ: ( loud whisper ) It's ok. Everything's under control.
WOODY: ( loud whisper ) It's ok. Everything's under control.
BUZZ: Woody?! What are you doing?!
SID: Oh, well, you and I can have a cookout later. Ha-ha-ha.
SID: ( continued ) .and counting. Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two!. One!.
SID: Sid pulls back from lighting the fuse. He turns to look at Woody still lying lifelessly atop the barbecue except for the sound emitting from his voice box.
SID: Sid walks over to Woody and picks him up.
SID: It's busted.
SID: WOODY ( VOICE BOX ) ( beat )
WOODY: ( regular voice ) So play nice.
SID: Woody and all the toys CHEER VICTORIOUSLY.
AAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!: Woody and all the toys CHEER VICTORIOUSLY.
SID: The toys! The toys are alive!
SID: ( continued ) N-N-Nice dolly.
HAMM: What's wrong, Sid?! Don't you want to play with Sally?!
WOODY: Nice work, fellahs. Good job. Comin' out of the ground what a touch! That was a stroke of genius.
BUZZ: Woody turns around and looks at Buzz, who's still affixed to Sid's launchpad. Buzz extends his hand to Woody.
BUZZ: They shake.
BUZZ: Woody! The van!
WOODY: ( to mutant toys ) We gotta run! Thanks, guys.
WOODY: Woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, but Buzz's rocket causes him to become stuck.
BUZZ: Just go! I'll catch up!
BUZZ: Come on!
A STRAP: dangles off the back of the truck. Buzz makes a leap for it and grabs hold. He climbs up the strap and onto the bumper. Woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach.
BUZZ: You can do it, Woody.
WOODY: Whew, I made it!
SCUD: The dog leaps forward and bites down on one of Woody's legs.
WOODY: ( kicking Scud with other foot ) Aaaaaahh!! Get away, you stupid dog! Down! Down!
BUZZ: Hold on, Woody!
WOODY: I can't do it! Take care of Andy for me!
BUZZ: Buzz leaps off of the truck and onto Scuds snout. He grabs Scud's eyelids and snaps them hard. Scud YELPS, letting go of Woody. The dog bucks wildly with Buzz hanging onto his The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz and Scud behind. Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto the bumper. He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to lift up the heavy door. Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop at a traffic light. Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward taking Woody with it. Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truck until he spots what he's looking for.

BUZZ: Who-o-o-oa! Woody!
WOODY: Well, thanks for the ride.
BUZZ: ( pointing ahead ) Look out!!
WOODY: Now let's catch up to that truck!
LENNY: Guys! Guys! Woody's riding RC! And Buzz is with him!
TOYS: The toys rush to the edge of the open truck. Bo picks up Lenny and looks through him.
BO PEEP: It is Buzz! Woody was telling the What have we done?!
SLINKY: What have we done?!
REX: Great. Now I have guilt.
WOODY: We're almost there.
BO PEEP: Rocky! The ramp!
BUZZ: Look out!! Quick! Hold on to my tail!
SLINKY: ( to other toys ) Quick! Hold on to my tail!
SLINKY: His slinky middle begins to stretch and stretch.
SLINKY: Woody! Speed up!
WOODY: ( to Buzz ) Speed up!
BUZZ: The batteries! They're running out!
SLINKY: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
SLINKY: I can't hold on much longer!
WOODY: Slink! Hang on!
WOODY: ( sarcastic ) Woody! The rocket!
BEAT: Woody! The rocket!
BUZZ: Woody! The rocket!
WOODY: The match!
WOODY: ( continued ) Yes! Thank you, Sid!
A CAR: whizzes right over them, blowing out the match. Woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls prostrate to the ground.
WOODY: No-o-o! No-no-no-no! No-o-o!
BUZZ: Woody?! What are you doing?
WOODY: Hold still, Buzz!
WOODY: You did it! Next stop. Andy.
BUZZ: You did it! Next stop. Andy.

SLINKY: I shoulda held on longer.
LENNY: Look! Look! It's Woody and Buzz! Comin' up fast!
REX: Take cover!!
WOODY: Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
BUZZ: Not today!
WINGS: jut out of Buzz, severing the tape that holds him to rocket. The toys separate from the rocket just before it BLOWS UP. The toys plummet.
WOODY: ( covering his eyes )
WOODY: Hey, Buzz!! You're flying!!
BUZZ: This isn't flying. This is falling with style!
WOODY: Ha ha!! To Infinity and Beyond!!
WOODY: Uh, Buzz?! We missed the truck!
BUZZ: We're not aiming for the truck!
ANDY: Hey! Wow!
MRS. DAVIS: What? What is it?
ANDY: ( picking up the toys ) Woody! Buzz!
MRS. DAVIS: Oh, great, you found them. Where were they?
ANDY: Here! In the car!
MRS. DAVIS: See? Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
WINDOW: Through the gently falling snow, the Davis family can be seen around the Christmas tree unwrapping presents.
ANDY: Which one can I open first?
MRS. DAVIS: Let's let Molly open one.
THE SARGENT: The plastic green soldier spies on the Davis family with his binoculars. He turns and motions back into the tree.
HAMM: ( to the room ) Hey, heads up everybody! It's
REX: Oh! It's time! Whoooooah! Oh! Bo! There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
BO PEEP: Whoooooah! Oh! Bo! There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
WOODY: Whoooooah! Oh! Bo! There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
BO PEEP: Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
WOODY: Say, isn't that mistletoe?
BO PEEP: Bo drops her crook, dips Woody and KISSES him. The rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor restless with "excitement" not fear.
REX: ( to Slinky ) Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur, like a leaf-eater. That way, I could play the, uh, dominant predator. Ha ha ha!
BUZZ: Quiet everyone, quiet!
