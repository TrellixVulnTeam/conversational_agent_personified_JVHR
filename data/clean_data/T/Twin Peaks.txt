COLE: I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CHET. SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE AND I WILL MEET YOU AT THE PORTLAND, AIRPORT.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Desmond exits the plane.
COLE: ( motioning to the man standing there )
STANLEY: It's a pleasure. I've heard a lot about SAM'S THE MAN WHO CRACKED THE WHITEMAN CASE. Congratulations. I heard about that.
COLE: SAM'S THE MAN WHO CRACKED THE WHITEMAN CASE. Congratulations. I heard about that.
DESMOND: Congratulations. I heard about that.
COLE: ( plowing ahead )
COLE: SHE'S MY MOTHER'S SISTER'S GIRL.
DESMOND: ( noticing the fingers )
COLE: GOOD LUCK, CHET.
OUT TODAY: Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
DESMOND: Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
STANLEY: That was really something. That dancing girl. What did it mean?
DESMOND: Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
STANLEY: Code, I've heard a lot about this. Sort of shorthand.
DESMOND: Sort of shorthand.
STANLEY: ( missing the humor ) Shorthand. really?
DESMOND: We're heading into a difficult situation.
STANLEY: How do you figure?
DESMOND: I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
DESMOND: Lil was wearing a sour face.
STANLEY: What do you mean?
DESMOND: Her face had a sour look. that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.
DESMOND: Both eyes blinking means there is going to be trouble higher up. the eyes of the local authority. A sheriff and a deputy. That would be my guess. Two of the local law enforcers are going to be a If you noticed she had one hand in her pocket which means they are hiding something, and the other hand made a fist which means they are going to be Lil was walking in place which means there's going to be a lot of legwork Cole said Lil was "his mother's sister's girl". What is missing in that sentence? The Uncle.
STANLEY: Oh, the uncle is missing.
DESMOND: Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
STANLEY: So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
DESMOND: Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
STANLEY: The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
DESMOND: Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
STANLEY: A blue rose.
DESMOND: Very good, but I can't tell you about
STANLEY: What did Gordon's tie mean?
DESMOND: What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
STANLEY: Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
DESMOND: He talks loud. And he loves his code.
STANLEY: I see. He does talk loud.
DESMOND: Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
STANLEY: It must be a high priority situation.
DESMOND: Good afternoon, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to see Sheriff Cable.
CLIFF: Why don't you folks have a seat. Make yourself at home. It's gonna be a while. Why don't you have some of that coffee. It was fresh two days ago.
DESMOND: Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
CLIFF: ( still smiling ) CLIFF ( continued )
DESMOND: You can start that FRESH pot of coffee right now.
CABLE: How the hell did you.
DESMOND: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. That's all right, Deputy, Sheriff Cable can take it from here I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
CABLE: Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
DESMOND: Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal You're lucky I am not wasting you.
CABLE: You're lucky I am not wasting you.
DESMOND: Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be "Federal". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.
CABLE: A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
DESMOND: That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
CABLE: Out back in our morgue It's 4:30. We close at five.
DESMOND: We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
STANLEY: You know, Agent Desmond, I figure this whole office, furniture included, is worth 27,000 dollars.
DESMOND: ( reading ) Teresa Banks lived at the Canyon Trailer Park for a month. We'll check that. And worked as a waitress at Hap's Truck Stop. Worked the Night Shift. Good place for dinner when we're thru here, Sam. ( flips to another page ) No one came to claim the body and no known next of kin.
STANLEY: Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
DESMOND: That's what I heard.
STANLEY: No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
DESMOND: That's good.
STANLEY: Yes, it is good. What do you think is in these other I don't know, Sam.
DESMOND: I don't know, Sam.
STANLEY: Maybe, later we could take a look.
DESMOND: Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
STANLEY: ( into his recorder ) Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of Cole said she was 17.
DESMOND: Cole said she was 17.
STANLEY: I wonder where her ring is?
DESMOND: ( looking into the personal effects )
STANLEY: There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
DESMOND: Stanley peers underneath the fingernail.
STANLEY: A laceration.
DESMOND: Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up
STANLEY: Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up
DESMOND: What is it?
STANLEY: It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
STANLEY: Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
DESMOND: We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
STANLEY: Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond? You've got your own M.O., don't you, Agent Desmond?
JACK: Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the Where's Hap?
DESMOND: Where's Hap?
JACK: He's dead - good and dead.
DESMOND: Sorry to hear it.
JACK: He didn't suffer.
DESMOND: I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
JACK: Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
DESMOND: Any friends?
JACK: Ever see her with someone else?
DESMOND: Ever see her with someone else?
JACK: Did she ever mention any friends?
DESMOND: Did she ever mention any friends?
JACK: ( pointing ) Ask Irene over there. JACK ( continued ) Now, her name _is_ Irene and it _is_ night. Don't take it any further than that. There's nothin' good about it.
IRENE: Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place - you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
DESMOND: How come Jack let's you work here?
IRENE: Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
DESMOND: Say no more.
DESMOND: ( showing credentials ) Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
IRENE: She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her What happened to her?
DESMOND: What happened to her?
IRENE: There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
DESMOND: Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
IRENE: Do you take cocaine, Irene?
DESMOND: Do you take cocaine, Irene?
IRENE: No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
STANLEY: Nicotine is a drug. Caffeine is a drug.
IRENE: Who's Shorty? Those drugs are legal.
DESMOND: He's with me. Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
IRENE: I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak
DESMOND: An OLD GUY, long and skinny, smoking, gets Desmond's attention.
OLD GUY: You talking about that little girl that was murdered?
DESMOND: You have something to tell us?
OLD GUY: OLD GUY
DESMOND: OLD GUY
OLD GUY: I can tell shit from shinolah. Gets me along way down that road.
STANLEY: You think we ought to question him?
DESMOND: What time is it, Stanley?
STANLEY: Desmond guides his laugh into a cough.
STANLEY: ( looking at his watch while his
DESMOND: It's late, Sam.
STANLEY: ( to himself as be dabs his pants
IRENE: You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely What do you mean?
DESMOND: What do you mean?
IRENE: Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking. I just thought I ought to tell you.
DESMOND: Stanley watches her leave.
STANLEY: I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
DESMOND: I think that's a good idea.
DESMOND: I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
STANLEY: Are you speaking to me in a code?
DESMOND: No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
STANLEY: In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
STANLEY: Thank god it is morning.
VOICE: OH, GOD, WHAT. WHAT.
VOICE: CAN'T YOU READ! Nine's really late. We are really early.
STANLEY: Nine's really late. We are really early.
CARL: God damn, this better be
DESMOND: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, More popular than Uncle's Day at a ( takes one step out of his trailer )
CARL: More popular than Uncle's Day at a ( takes one step out of his trailer )
DESMOND: Did she have someone with her?
CARL: Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
DESMOND: Was there an argument?
CARL: Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
DESMOND: Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
CARL: No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite-Able". Here's the trailer now. And this is exactly the way she left it. I never touched a GOD DAMN THING.
GOD!: Desmond and Stanley go in.
STANLEY: ( whispers ) She lived alone.
DESMOND: She must have known someone. You better dust this place, Sam.
STANLEY: I'll get my kit.
STANLEY: ( to himself ) 5,600 dollars.
DESMOND: Take a look at this.
STANLEY: She's wearing a ring.
DESMOND: My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
STANLEY: ( squinting at the picture ) May I see the magnifying glass, Agent ( takes a look, then looks at There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
CARL: I'm gonna make myself some Good Morning America. You want some?
DESMOND: You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
CARL: That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
STANLEY: ( watching Desmond drink ) We really do need a good "wake me up", don't we, Agent Desmond? ( after a long look from Desmond ) We really do need a good "wake me up", don't we, Agent Desmond?
DESMOND: Did you know Teresa Banks?
CLIFF: Hey, how's J. Edgar doin'? Bet you appreciate them bustin' your mornin' in half, eh, Carl? Bet they woke you up.
CARL: They're only doing their job.
DESMOND: What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
CLIFF: Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
DESMOND: Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
CLIFF: You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' Maybe if you did a little less partyin' that little girl would still be alive.
CARL: Maybe if you did a little less partyin' that little girl would still be alive.
CLIFF: Is that right, Mr. Jack Daniels?
DESMOND: Did you know Teresa Banks?
CLIFF: Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
DESMOND: No you couldn't.
DESMOND: Is there a golf course around here?
CARL: Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with
DESMOND: Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
CARL: That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
STANLEY: I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
DESMOND: He's not the murderer. But he's a bozo.
STANLEY: Yes, he is like a clown.
CABLE: What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about Maybe not _a_ thing, but maybe _two_ Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
DESMOND: We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about Maybe not _a_ thing, but maybe _two_ Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?

DESMOND: ( turning to Stanley ) Sam, get the body and put it in the van. Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
CABLE: ( flexing the muscles in his arm )
STANLEY: ( coming close to Desmond ) When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
DESMOND: I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
CABLE: Now, J. Edgar, I'm going to take off my badge, here. Do you mind? The only way you're going to get that body is over mine.
CLIFF: ( to Desmond ) You try that you little monkey.
DESMOND: I think I'll take off my badge as well. ( eyeing Cable's glass jaw ) This one's comin' from J. Edgar.
DESMOND: ( eyeing Cable's glass jaw ) This one's comin' from J. Edgar.
DESMOND: Who's next?
DESMOND: Take the van back to Portland, Stanley. I'm going to take one more look at the trailer park.
STANLEY: ( confidentially ) One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty Faulty wiring.
DESMOND: Faulty wiring.
STANLEY: Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond? I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
DESMOND: Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
STANLEY: We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
DESMOND'S POV: As he enters the van, Desmond can barely make out what Stanley says as he points to the driver.
STANLEY: ( very muffled ) 83,000 dollars.

COOPER: And no one found the ring?

LAURA: If you can fuck and drive the party starts right now. You shift that one. This one's mine.
ALBERT: Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
COOPER: The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
ALBERT: Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
COOPER: You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
ALBERT: You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
COOPER: Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
ALBERT: Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
COOPER: A woman.
ALBERT: What color hair will she have?
COOPER: Tell me some other things about her.
ALBERT: Tell me some other things about her.
COOPER: She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.

LAURA: Okay. You can help me carry them to the
LAURA'S POV: Mrs. Tremond and her grandson are standing in the parking lot staring at Laura. Mrs. Tremond waves to Laura to come over. When Laura comes to them Mrs. Tremond holds out a framed picture.
TREMOND: This would look nice on your wall.
GRANDSON: He's looking for a book with pages torn out. He's walking towards the hiding place. He's moving under the fan now.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Shelly comes out of the Diner with another load of meals. Laura turns back to her and then back to the Tremonds, who are walking away from her and are farther away than they realistically could be. Laura comes to Shelly in a panic.
LAURA: Shelly, you really can help me. I can't do the "Meals on Wheels" today. I just

SHELLY: You're right. There's no one here.
NORMA: There's no one here.
SHELLY: Norma, are you alright?
NORMA: Come back as soon as you can.
SHELLY: If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
NORMA: Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.
ON NORMA: In the empty diner Norma walks over and sits in a booth. She studies the empty diner. After a while the cook, TOAD, calls from the kitchen. A distant forlorn call.
TOAD: Kind of quiet.
LAURA: ( frantic whispers ) He's looking for the book, he's going to the hiding place!
LAURA'S POV: She stops and stares. Her house suddenly looks very frightening to her. She slowly crosses her front yard and enters the house.
ON BOB: He is frozen. Smiling at her.
LAURA: ( frantic whisper ) What? It can't be. It can't be him. no.
WOMAN: A closer look reveals how upset Laura is.
WOMAN: What. Laura are you all right?

DONNA: You want a muffin?
LAURA: Donna, you are a muffin.
DOC: The red rose. Where is the red rose? You know the light at Sparkwood and 21? It worked right there. I just did it right there.
DOC: ( stands and stares at Laura Why is it that you can't smoke at your home and I'm a doctor and I don't allow smoking in my home and I let you smoke in my home?
LAURA: ( smiling her killer smile ) Because you love me so much.
DOC: I do love you, you little smoking whipper snapper.
EILEEN: These muffins each have at least seven full huckleberries in them.
DONNA: Dad, what in the world are you doing?

LELAND: Look at this finger here.
SARAH: Laura didn't wash her hands before And look at this.
LELAND: Laura didn't wash her hands before And look at this.
LELAND: Oh, is this from a lover? Did you get this from your lover?
SARAH: They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
LELAND: Bobby didn't give you this?
SARAH: How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
LELAND: ( as he is pinching ) Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
SARAH: Leland leave her alone. She doesn't like that. Stop it.
LELAND: How do you know what she doesn't like?
SARAH: Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
LELAND: Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.

LELAND: I can't remember the last time I told Laura that I loved her.
SARAH: Well, honey, go in and tell her now.
LELAND: Laura, honey. I love you. I love you so much.
LELAND: Goodnight, Princess.
COOPER: ( to camera ) Don't take the ring. Laura, don't take the ring.
ON LAURA: She turns to her right to see who it is, then turning back to her left she discovers ANNIE BLACKBURN lying in bed with her. Annie has blood around her mouth. She tries to raise herself and strains to speak.
ANNIE: My name is Annie. I've been with Laura and Dale. The good Dale is in the lodge and he can't leave. Write it in your
ON LAURA: Laura looks towards her door then turns back to Annie but she is gone. Filled with fear she looks down and in her hand is Teresa Banks' ring. SHE SCREAMS. Again, her attention is drawn to her door and her mother's distant call. Still holding the ring she gets out of bed and goes to her door and slowly opens it. It is dark on the other side of the door.
JAMES: Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.

LAURA: Mom, take it easy.

LAURA: Mom, you're not having a nervous
LEO: Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
SHELLY: Lay off the bennies, Leo.
LEO: ( continuing his tirade ) Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.
SHELLY: As if I didn't know.
LEO: I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
SHELLY: Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work.
LEO: What did you say?
LEO: Shelly, I am not fooling around anymore. The first thing you've got to WORK on is a good attitude. That's the key. Anybody will tell you that.
LEO: Don't even _think_ about going anywhere, Shelly. I'm not finished with you.
LEO: What are you doing calling me here?. No way, you already owe me money. Five thousand, to be exact.
SHELLY: ( silently mouthing it ) Five Thousand???
JACQUES: How come you only call me when you are desperate? Are you desperate, baby?
BOBBY: You interested or not?
BOBBY: You interested or not?
JACQUES: Maybe, Bobby, baby. Maybe. I have friend who has what you want. His stuff is the best.

DONNA: Where are the Cookies?
LAURA: You mean Fred and Ginger?
DONNA: Donna looks around at all the ashtrays filled to the brim with butts.
DONNA: ( looking at the cigarettes ) If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
LAURA: Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
LOG LADY: When this kind of fire starts. it is very hard to put out. The tender bows of innocence burn first and the wind rises - then all goodness is in jeopardy.

TRUCKER: Buck, that was really nice. All right, Donna. Let's go.
LAURA: Buck, that was really nice. All right, Donna. Let's go.
DONNA: ( to Laura, a little afraid ) What are you doing?
LAURA: Laura laughs at Donna then holds a beer up to show Donna, then turns and French kisses Buck. Donna reaches forward to the front dash and turns the radio up full blast. Buck and Tommy start to whoop and yodel like cowboys. Buck does an Indian whoop in Laura's face. Laura freezes in horror.
DONNA: ( to Laura ) I'm goin' for it.
DONNA: ( turns to Laura ) I don't need to take this to be you YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you ( pointing to skid marks behind a heat popping car ) Hey, Tommy, Jacques beat us here.

LAURA: Hey, Donna, chug-a-lug.
JACQUES: Oh, Laura's friend. I am "The Great There is no tomorrow.
DONNA'S POV: The room starts to spin.
DONNA: A completely stoned Donna is being dances around by Tommy, who is falling in love with her. Through some dancing legs and feet she spots Laura's blouse on the floor. Teetering she leans over, picks up the blouse, and ties it around her waist. RONETTE PULASKI, flying high, makes her way through the crowd to Laura. They spot each other and give each other a hug.
RONETTE: You smell nice.
LAURA: Haven't seen you since I was thrown out of One Eyed Jacks.
RONETTE: ( trying to focus on Laura ) What else did we do together? Oh, I ( tries to dance with Laura ) Hey, you know what? It's been a year. She's been dead a year. she's been dead a year.
JACQUES: The party twins. My high school sandwich. Let's put some meat inside.
RONETTE: She's been dead a year.
JACQUES: Teresa Banks? Yeah, a whole year.
RONETTE: Teresa Banks? Yeah, a whole year.
LAURA: Teresa Banks? Yeah, a whole year.
RONETTE: Yeah, she was going to get rich. she was blackmailing somebody.
JACQUES: That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked What? She asked about my father?
LAURA: ( jolted ) What? She asked about my father?
JACQUES: But it wasn't him. she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. She said he looked just like a boxer. Speaking of sandwiches. I think Bobby was arranging something for you. Speaking of arrangements. SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS. Why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? Leo and I know that Santy Claus is coming to town. Thursday.
LAURA: ( turning to kiss Jacques ) "The Great Went".
RONETTE: Here we go again. Like we're back at One Eyed Jacks.

RONETTE: Shit, is that Donna Hayward?

SPARKY: Sure wouldn't work at my house. My wife couldn't take the wrapper of a
TRUMAN: Josie, I think we should go public.
JOSIE: That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
TRUMAN: What are you afraid of? What people I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
JOSIE: I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
TRUMAN: Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
JOSIE: Fish eyes?
TRUMAN: Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
JOSIE: Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
TRUMAN: I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes. I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
JOSIE: I understand.
TRUMAN: We throw away the _whole_ head.
DONNA: I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should No, you should forget about last night.
LAURA: No, you should forget about last night.
DONNA: Laura, I am your friend.
LAURA: I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
DONNA: You're not mad at me?
LAURA: I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night They all knew you at that place.
DONNA: I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night They all knew you at that place.
LAURA: What can I tell you?
DONNA: How did the car get back here?
LAURA: WE got it back, that's all.
DONNA: How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
LAURA: I can't help you there.
DONNA: Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
LAURA: All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
DONNA: But I love you, Laura.
LAURA: And I love you, too. But don't wear my Why do you do it, Laura?
DONNA: Why do you do it, Laura?
LAURA: Cause I like it.
ON LELAND: Leland is standing at the other end of the room. As he stares at the girls we move in on his face.
LELAND FLASHBACK: Leland looking into another room seeing Laura and Ronette sitting face to face on a bed.
