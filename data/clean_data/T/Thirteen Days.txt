KENNY: Hi, hon. They kiss in passing. Daughter KATHY, 12, races by in angry pursuit of her twin, KEVIN, 12.
HELEN: Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
KENNY: Kids are supposed to get detention. Kenny dumps the bundle with Mark in a big pile of dirty EXT. MCCOY AIR FORCE BASE - FLORIDA - DAY A pair of massive FILM CANISTERS unlock and drop from the belly of the U-2. TECHNICIANS secure them in orange carrying cases, lock them under key, fast and proficient. They whisk them out from under the spy plane. The Technicians run for an idling Jeep. They sling the cases into the rear of the vehicle which in turn accelerates away hard, curving across the runway for another waiting plane.
KENNY: Secretary of Defense.
KEVIN: Dean Rusk!
KENNY: Wrong, and you get to wax my car. KENNY JR. smirk at Kevin.
HELEN: Got time for pancakes?
KENNY: Nope. Attorney General? A PHONE RINGS as the kids cry out en masse.
KIDS: ( chorus ) Too easy! Bobby, Bobby Kennedy! Kenny glances up at the wall. There are two phones, side by side. One RED, one BLACK. It's the black one ringing. Helen answers. Kenny goes back to his papers.
KENNY: All right, wise guys, Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America.
KENNY: Morning, Floyd.
KENNY: Top o' the morning, Mr. President. The figure lowers the paper. It is PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY. He's wearing boxers and a tank top. Unshaven. Bed-head. Kenny O'Donnell, former ward-pol and long-time Kennedy man, is his Chief of Staff.
THE PRESIDENT: Morning, Kenny. You see this goddamn Capehart stuff? The President rattles the paper. Kenny collapses in the chair opposite the President, sprawls, comfortable.
KENNY: Bayh's going to lose, but it's good groundwork for us for '64. Kenny steals a piece of buttered toast off the President's plate. The President spares him a glance.
THE PRESIDENT: I was eating that.
KENNY: No you weren't.
THE PRESIDENT: ( scanning the paper ) I was, you bastard. Kenny takes a defiant bite.
KENNY: Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo.
POL #1: We're putting up Potowski next time. Will you guys come out for him?
KENNY: Who else you got?
POL #2: There's Richardson. Good kid.
KENNY: Got the touch?
POL #2: Yeah. Still moldable, too.
KENNY: Everyone likes a good kid. And like that, a congressional candidate is made. Kenny accelerates, leaving the Pols behind. Suddenly, outside the windows, the crowd swells forward with a collective ROAR.
CROWD: MR. PRESIDENT! PRESIDENT KENNEDY! EXT. HOTEL - DAY Kenny heads down the steps with New York Times Washington Bureau Chief, SCOTTY RESTON. Anonymous, they weave their way through the crowd for a police car on a side street.
RESTON: How's my favorite President?
KENNY: Busy. But you've got his heart.
RESTON: I want an hour with him.
KENNY: I said his heart, not his attention.
RESTON: Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
KENNY: Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
RESTON: I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau. Kenny just sighs as they make their way up to the police car. A Secret Service Agent opens the door for him, another is behind the wheel.
KENNY: We're giving the Brits Polaris instead. But a story'll just aggravate things. Scotty stares at Kenny, determined. Kenny looks away. And his eye catches a tall, willowy BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. She is talking, excited, embarrassed, to two more SECRET SERVICE AGENTS. What they're saying is lost in the noise. Scotty follows Kenny's gaze. Then the two men share a look, a silent understanding. Kenny glances at the Secret Service guy holding the car door, tilts his head at the woman.
RESTON: Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
KENNY: Forget it, Scotty.
RESTON: Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you. The formula's exactly what Kenny wants to hear. He pretends to consider, pretends to cave as he gets in the car.
KENNY: All right, you're in. Half hour. Reston's won. But so has Kenny, and he's made Scotty feel tough in the bargain. People like Kenny.
KENNY: Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
BUNDY: No, Ken. I need to see him now.
KENNY: Morning, Floyd.
KENNY: What's it about?
BUNDY: Bundy is tense. But Kenny relaxes.
KENNY: Just Cuba? Okay, I got work to do, see you guys downstairs.
KENNY: ( to phone, scary calm ) Listen to me, you worthless piece of disloyal shit. You will pull Daly's man on the circuit. You owe your goddamn job to this administration. ( beat, listening ) There is a word you need to learn. It is the only word in politics. Loyalty. LOYALTY you motherfucking piece of shit! As Kenny THROWS the phone down at the receiver, and the PRIVATE DOOR to the Oval Office suddenly opens. Kenny glances up. President Kennedy stands there in the doorway. Kenny thinks he's reacting to the tirade.
THE PRESIDENT: I think you should come in here. Kenny starts for the door.
KENNY: Not as far as the election goes. The President lets Kenny by into.
THE PRESIDENT: You used to look down a bomb sight for a living, Ken. What do you see? In eerie silence, as all eyes follow him, Kenny makes his way among the presentation boards with the U-2 imagery, stops in front of the picture of the six canvas-covered objects. It unleashes a wave of memories.
KENNY: We hit a Nazi buzz bomb field in '45. It looks like a rocket base. He puts his hand out to touch the image, then turns and looks to the President, knowing what they must be.
BUNDY: On Sunday morning, one of our U-2s took these pictures. The Soviets are putting medium range ballistic missiles into Shock. Silence. Kenny glances to the other men.
LUNDAHL: They appear to be the SS-4: range of a thousand miles, three-megaton nuclear Jesus Christ in Heaven.
KENNY: Jesus Christ in Heaven.
VARIOUS OPERATORS: Please hold for the White House.Mr. O'Donnell for Secretary McNamara. White House Operator. please hold.
KENNY: The principals are assembling in an hour. See you then. Kenny hangs up. The President enters. A beat. And in that beat, there's a void. The two men are off their emotional stride, trying to grope their way out of shock.
THE PRESIDENT: Where's Bobby? Kenny nods, acknowledging the feeling
KENNY: Should be here any minute.
THE PRESIDENT: And we glimpse the chemistry of these guys by Bobby's absence. It's like they're missing their third wheel.
THE PRESIDENT: In here! They turn to the door as BOBBY KENNEDY, 37, the President's younger brother/Attorney General, enters. Bobby shuts the door behind him, falls into Kenny's chair, and clearly grappling with his own disbelief, is hushed.
BOBBY: Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
THE PRESIDENT: Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
BOBBY: ( shaking his head ) Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba. ( beat ) By the way, you realize we just lost the Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
KENNY: Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
BOBBY: You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken. The President paces away, grim.
KENNY: Jesus. I feel like we've caught the Jap carriers steaming for Pearl Harbor.
GROUP: Good morning, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: Good morning, gentlemen. And the doors close on the eighteen men of EXCOM: The Executive Committee of the National Security Council. They are the legendary "Best and Brightest." The President makes his way down the line: shakes hands with Secretary of State DEAN RUSK, 53, distinguished, with a soft, Georgian accent, a distant reserve.
RUSK: Mr. President. The President leans past him, grasps the hand of the Secretary of Defense ROBERT MCNAMARA, 46, a gifted managerial genius. the price of which is a cold, hard personality.
THE PRESIDENT: Bob. Bet you had a late night.
MCNAMARA: Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President. OFF TO THE SIDE, Kenny greets Vice President LYNDON JOHNSON, 54, and ADLAI STEVENSON, 62, Representative to the U.N., intellectual, well-spoken.
KENNY: Lyndon. Adlai. The silver-haired war hero and politically savvy Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff, GENERAL MAXWELL TAYLOR, 50s, shakes the President's hand.
THE PRESIDENT: GENERAL TAYLOR McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though. He gestures to GENERAL MARSHALL CARTER, Deputy Chief of Operations for the CIA. Carter nods to the President.
GENERAL TAYLOR: McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though. He gestures to GENERAL MARSHALL CARTER, Deputy Chief of Operations for the CIA. Carter nods to the President.
KENNY: The room falls silent. The President looks across the table to GENERAL CARTER.
SORENSEN: The room falls silent. The President looks across the table to GENERAL CARTER.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Let's have it.
GENERAL CARTER: Arthur Lundahl heads our photographic interpretation division at CIA. I'll let him and his boys take you through what we've got. Arthur? Lundahl, standing at the end of the room with briefing boards, steps forward with a pointer.
LUNDAHL: Gentlemen, as most of you now know a U-2 over Cuba on Sunday morning took a series of disturbing photographs.
LUNDAHL: IRONBARK reports the SS-4 can deliver a 3-megaton nuclear weapon 1000 miles. So far we have identified 32 missiles served by around 3400 men, undoubtedly all Soviet personnel. Our cities and military installations in the Southeast, as far north as Washington, are in range of these weapons, and in the event of a launch, would only have five minutes of Five minutes, gentlemen. Five minutes.
GENERAL CARTER: Five minutes, gentlemen. Five minutes.
GENERAL TAYLOR: In those five minutes they could kill 80 million Americans and destroy a significant number of our bomber bases, degrading our retaliatory options. The Joint Chiefs' consensus is that this is a massively destabilizing move, upsetting the nuclear balance. The President stares at Lundahl, and beating out each word.
THE PRESIDENT: Arthur. Are. You. Sure? Lundahl looks around the room. Everyone is hanging.
LUNDAHL: Yes, Mr. President. These are nuclear The men come to grips with their own fears, own anger.
BOBBY: How long until they're operational?
LUNDAHL: General Taylor can answer that question better than I can. General Taylor drops a memo on the table WHICH BECOMES:
GENERAL TAYLOR: I have to stress that there may be more missiles that we don't know about. We need more U-2 coverage. Kenny lets out his breath. He catches Bobby's eye. This is Is there any indication - anything at all - that suggests they intend to use these missiles in some sort of first Not at present, sir. But I think the prudent answer is we don't know.
THE PRESIDENT: Is there any indication - anything at all - that suggests they intend to use these missiles in some sort of first Not at present, sir. But I think the prudent answer is we don't know.
GENERAL CARTER: Not at present, sir. But I think the prudent answer is we don't know.
THE PRESIDENT: Do we have any sort of intelligence from CIA on what Khruschev is thinking?
GENERAL CARTER: No, Mr. President. We don't. We just don't know what's happening inside the Kremlin at that level.
BOBBY: They lied to us. Two weeks ago Dobrynin told me to my face Khurschev had no intention of putting missiles into Cuba. They said themselves, this is our There's angry agreement. The President cuts it off.
THE PRESIDENT: Gentlemen, I want first reactions. Assuming for a moment Khruschev has not gone off the deep end and intends to start World War Three, what are we looking at? Rusk glances to his team at the end of the table. Ball, Johnson, Martin, Thompson and Stevenson.
RUSK: Mr. President, I believe my team is in agreement. If we permit the introduction of nuclear missiles to a Soviet satellite nation in our hemisphere, the diplomatic consequences will be too terrible to contemplate. The Russians are trying to show the world they can do whatever they want, wherever they want, and we're powerless to stop them. If they succeed.
BOBBY: It will be Munich all over again.
RUSK: Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive. Confidence in our security commitments around the world will falter, allies will become unsure in the face of Soviet pressure, and the Soviets will be emboldened to push us even harder. We must remove the missiles one way or another. It seems to me the options are either to build up the crisis 'til they give in, or we hit them. An air strike. There's silence at the table. Some nods. Understanding.
THE PRESIDENT: We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched. And there it is. The clock is running.
MCNAMARA: We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched. And there it is. The clock is running.
BUNDY: Sir. We need to consider. if we decide to act, there's a good chance we'll end up in a general war. The room falls silent. The President leans back in his chair, studying the circle of men around the table, weighing Kenny and the others watch him in silence. A long, dramatic pause. A course that will change history is about to be chosen. The President leans forward, folds his hands on the table. Fated. Grave.
THE PRESIDENT: It's clear we cannot permit Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. We must get those missiles out.
THE PRESIDENT: I don't think it's going to matter what Khruschev's intentions are. I tell you, right now. I don't see any way around hitting them. A long moment of silence as they move along again.
KENNY: If we hit 'em, kill a lot of Russians, they'll move against Berlin. They attack Berlin, that's NATO. and we're at war. The guys stop again. The autumn day is bright, warm, alive. The air, the distant city sounds derail the relentless train of logic for a beat. And in their faces we see that all three men, for the first time, feel the enormity of war, its shadow over everything. It's only a couple of steps away. Steps that they're seriously contemplating.
BOBBY: Damned if we do, but if we don't, we're in a war for sure somewhere else in six Pained, the President turns away.
THE PRESIDENT: No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
KENNY: There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
BOBBY: He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use So if there are alternatives that make sense - and I'm not saying there are - we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
THE PRESIDENT: So if there are alternatives that make sense - and I'm not saying there are - we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
BOBBY: What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus. I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
THE PRESIDENT: We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
KENNY: The other thing is.
BOBBY: . I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
KENNY: They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
BOBBY: We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options. Kenny and the President look at him. Bobby nods.
KENNY: ( to the President ) It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
BOBBY: It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. We'll call it EXCOM. Kenny snorts a laugh. Bobby shoots him a cross look.
KENNY: EXCOM. Has a ring to it. Like F-Troop. The President stops. Bobby and Kenny stop, too.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast. You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
KENNY: Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press You're going to have to keep up your schedule - your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State. Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight. Bobby nods.
BOBBY: I think we should bring in Dean Acheson. He was fighting Soviets while we were still working the wards in Boston. The President nods his approval. Looks at Kenny.
THE PRESIDENT: Find him, Kenny. We're going to need all the help we can get.
RESTON: Hey, Kenny! Who died? Kenny glances over his shoulder at Scotty who points to a window. A beat, then Kenny returns to look out the window. Outside, the West Wing Drive is FILLED WITH LIMOUSINES. A flash of dismay, but Kenny covers fast.
KENNY: Way it's going, the Democratic Party. DNC strategy session. If you can call it that. Scotty chuckles. Kenny moves off, leading him away. Kenny's assistant runs up behind him, holding out a slip of paper.
ASSISTANT: Kenny tries to look him away.
RESTON: It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
KENNY: Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
RESTON: Kenny turns, harsh
ASSISTANT: Kenny turns, harsh
KENNY: What is it? The Assistant eyes Scotty, holds his tongue. Kenny takes the The number you asked for.
ASSISTANT: The number you asked for.
KENNY: I ask for a lot of 'em. Whose is it?
ASSISTANT: Dean Acheson's, sir. That shuts Kenny up. Reston eyes the slip, then looks to Kenny's face. And he knows something isn't right here.
KENNY: Gotta go, Scotty. See you tomorrow.
BOBBY: Screw secrecy. You try having that fat ass sit on your lap all the way from Foggy Bottom.
MCNAMARA: You were excited. I say no more. The gang falls in behind Kenny, trails him out of the garage.
BOBBY: Everybody agrees the diplomatic route is out. It's too slow, and they'll have the missiles finished. Kenny looks at him. Then there's only one alternative. The CAMERA wipes through the ceiling to:
GENERAL SWEENEY: We have 850 planes assembling at Homestead, Eglin, Opa Locka, MacDill, Patrick, Pensacola and Key West.
ADLAI: I still think there are diplomatic approaches we haven't considered yet. Kenny looks at Adlai. The others around the room, embarrassed, don't respond. The group has moved on and Stevenson hasn't.
GENERAL TAYLOR: We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option. The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of
THE PRESIDENT: An invasion.
GENERAL TAYLOR: Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again. Kenny looks around the room at the men, the murmurs of general agreement, senses the consensus building and is Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
THE PRESIDENT: Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
GENERAL TAYLOR: Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later. The President leans back in his chair, turns to the man at the far end of the table: DEAN ACHESON, 60s, former Secretary of State. He sits silent, like some revered oracle, the architect of the American Cold War strategy of containment.
THE PRESIDENT: Dean. What do you think? Acheson arches an eyebrow, and when he speaks, his voice resonates throughout the room, powerful, smooth, hypnotic.
ACHESON: Mr. President, you have rightly dismissed the diplomatic option. The Soviet will only tie you down in negotiation, and leave us short of our goal, the removal of the missiles. Negotiating will do nothing more than give them time to make the missiles operational, complicating the necessary military task we have at hand. Everyone in the room listens to him with rapt attention, his presence overshadowing the room, oracular:
THE PRESIDENT: Then it appears we have three options. Number one. A surgical air strike against the missiles themselves. Two, a larger air strike against their air defenses along with the missiles. Kenny eyes Bobby. Bobby is writing something.
GENERAL TAYLOR: Yes, sir, we're preparing to implement all three options, though I must stress again, sir, there are risks to the strikes without the follow-on invasion. Bundy clears his throat. Speaks from somewhere down the You want to be clear, Mr. President, that we have definitely decided against a political track. The President folds the note away, glances at Bobby. A beat, the President looks from Bobby to Acheson.
BUNDY: You want to be clear, Mr. President, that we have definitely decided against a political track. The President folds the note away, glances at Bobby. A beat, the President looks from Bobby to Acheson.
THE PRESIDENT: Dean, how does this play out?
ACHESON: Your first step, sir, will be to demand that the Soviet withdraw the missiles within 12 to 24 hours. They will refuse. When they do, you will order the strikes, followed by the invasion. They will resist, but will be overrun. They will retaliate against a target somewhere else in the world, most likely Berlin. We will honor our treaty commitments and resist them there, defeating them per our plans.
THE PRESIDENT: Those plans call for the use of nuclear And what is the next step? Acheson sits back in his chair, smooths his moustache. A dramatic beat, and then his ominous pronouncement rings out:
ACHESON: Hopefully cooler heads will prevail before we reach the next step. A chill runs down Kenny's spine. He looks in shock to the President. The President remains calm. But in place of the fated look the President has had, there's a hesitation.
GENERAL TAYLOR: If McNamara'd get off the fence.
BUNDY: We have time.
GENERAL CARTER: Goddamn it, it's obvious. It's the only option. That asshole, Stevenson. We can't let this drag out or we lose our Bombing them.
BUNDY: Bombing them.
ACHESON: Remember that the Kennedys' father was one of the architects of Munich. The General is right. There is only one responsible choice here. Bundy just nods. Taylor grabs a door ahead for Acheson.
RESUME: Kenny finishes pouring him and Bobby a couple of more shots, discreetly turning a blind eye to the President's pain. The President returns from his desk, shirt untucked, disheveled, back stiff. He eases into his rocking chair. Bobby lies sprawled on the couch. Kenny sits down. They all look at each other. A beat, something like shock.
KENNY: Jesus Christ Almighty. They burst out laughing. An absurd, tension draining moment. They shoot their drinks, Kenny refills.
THE PRESIDENT: Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
KENNY: There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man. The President stares Kenny in the face, understanding.
THE PRESIDENT: The thing is, Acheson's right. Talk alone won't accomplish anything. Kenny considers the President, his face straight as he says:
KENNY: Then let's bomb the shit out of them. Everyone wants to, even you, even me. It sure would feel good. The President sees what Kenny's saying: it'd be an emotional response, not necessarily the intelligent one.
BOBBY: Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
KENNY: He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again. Bobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
BOBBY: As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
THE PRESIDENT: Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy. The President is rendered mute by a wave of pain. Kenny and Bobby aver their eyes. When it passes, the President is hushed, grave.
RESTON: Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
KENNY: He was.
RESTON: Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
KENNY: Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
RESTON: I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing But Kenny stands there, mute. Reston just shakes his head, knowing for sure something's up. He turns and heads back for the press corps.
THE PRESIDENT: Let's get out of here.
KENNY: Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
BOBBY: No. No. No. There is more than one option here. If one isn't occurring to us, it's because we haven't thought hard McNamara squirms. The others react in frustration. CIA chief JOHN MCCONE, sharp, tough, conservative, is harsh.
MCCONE: Sometimes there is only one right choice, and you thank God when it's You're talking about a sneak attack! How'll that make us look? Big country blasting a little one into the stone age. We'll be real favorites around the Bobby, that's naive. This is the real world, you know that better than anybody. Your argument is ridiculous.
BOBBY: You're talking about a sneak attack! How'll that make us look? Big country blasting a little one into the stone age. We'll be real favorites around the Bobby, that's naive. This is the real world, you know that better than anybody. Your argument is ridiculous.
ACHESON: Bobby, that's naive. This is the real world, you know that better than anybody. Your argument is ridiculous.
MCCONE: You weren't so ethically particular when we were talking about options for removing Castro over at CIA. And there's nothing Bobby can say to that. He props himself up on the table, stares at it as if there's an answer in its shiny surface somewhere. There is only the reflection of his own face.
BOBBY: I can't let my brother go down in History like a villain, like a Tojo, ordering another Pearl Harbor. McCone, Acheson, and Taylor share a look. The last resistance to airstrikes is crumbling. Finally, Bobby looks up at McNamara.
MCNAMARA: Six months ago we gamed out a scenario. It's slow. It doesn't get rid of the missiles. There are a lot of drawbacks. The scenario was for a blockade of Cuba.
GENERAL TAYLOR: The situation is worse than we thought. We count 40 missiles now, longer range IRBMs. They can hit every city in the continental U.S. The President stares out the window at the Rose Garden, his back to Air Force Chief of Staff GENERAL CURTIS LEMAY, 60. Beetle-browed, arrogant, the archetypal Cold War general. Yet there is something about him, his intelligence perhaps, that suggests he's playing a role he knows and believes in. The only other civilians in the room are Bobby, Bundy and McNamara. The pressure from the military is almost physical.
LEMAY: Mr. President, as of this moment my planes are ready to carry out the air strikes. All you have to do is give me the word, sir, and my boys will get those Red bastards. The President continues staring out the window. Kenny eases over to the desk, leans on it, arms folded, interposing himself between the President and the soldiers. Bobby joins him, side-by-side.
THE PRESIDENT: How long until the army is ready?
GENERAL TAYLOR: We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
LEMAY: But you can begin the strikes, now. The plans call for an eight-day air campaign. It'd light a fire under the army's ass to get in place. That makes the President turn around, stare at LeMay.
THE PRESIDENT: General LeMay, do you truly believe that's our best course of action?
LEMAY: Mr. President, I believe it is the only course of action. American is in danger. Those missiles are a threat to our bomber bases and the safety of our nuclear deterrent. Without our deterrent, there's nothing to keep the enemy from choosing general nuclear war. It's our duty, our responsibility to the American people to take out those missiles and return stability to the strategic situation. The Big Red Dog is digging in our back yard, and we're justified in shooting him. Taylor steps in softly, smoothly: good cop to LeMay's bad.
GENERAL TAYLOR: Sir, we have a rapidly closing window of opportunity where we can prevent those missiles from ever becoming operational. The other options. He spares a look at McNamara, who watches the fireworks, arms folded, serious.
LEMAY: Mr. President, the motto I chose for SAC is 'Peace is our Profession.' God forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear exchange. But if launched, those missiles in Cuba would kill a lot of Americans. That's why I'm being such a pain in the ass about destroying them. Destroying them immediately. Hell, even Mac agrees. Bundy is uncomfortable. Everyone turns to him. He nods. Kenny realizes he's been co-opted by the military. McNamara does too, lets out a deep breath. The President eyes Bundy, then paces out from behind his desk, walks up to LeMay.
THE PRESIDENT: General, what will the Soviets do when we attack?
LEMAY: Kenny, Bobby and the President look at each other, unable to believe what they just heard.
THE PRESIDENT: Nothing. Because the only alternative open to them is one they can't choose. His pronouncement hangs there in the air: ominous, dangerous.
LEMAY: Nothing. Because the only alternative open to them is one they can't choose. His pronouncement hangs there in the air: ominous, dangerous.
THE PRESIDENT: Those aren't just missiles we'll be destroying. We kill Soviet soldiers, and they will respond. How would we respond if they killed ours? No, they will do something, General, I promise you that. And I believe it'll be INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY LeMay walk out of the Oval Office with Taylor, Carter and their staffers.
LEMAY: Those goddamn Kennedys are going to destroy this country if we don't do something about this. There are dark looks on the faces of the other officers. They agree.
KENNY: I was hoping LeMay pushed you. I wouldn't mind going a few rounds with The President glances up, takes the proffered smokes.
THE PRESIDENT: We knew it was coming. I tell you, Kenny, these brass hats have one big advantage. We do what they want us to, none of us will be alive to tell 'em they were wrong. Bobby, Rusk and Sorensen enter from the hall.
SORENSEN: Mr. President, Gromyko should be on his way by now.
RUSK: We need to go over what you're going to There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
BOBBY: There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
THE PRESIDENT: We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
SALINGER: Kenny, I'm getting funny questions from the guys in the press office. As Press Secretary, I need to know. What's going Kenny wheels back into his office. It's filled with people. But he bends confidentially to Pierre's ear.
KENNY: They're planning to shave you bald next time you fall asleep on the bus. Sorry, Pierre, Gromyko just arrived.
RESTON: Are they going to discuss the military exercises going on in Florida? Kenny doesn't even blink, but Sorensen does a poorer job at hiding his reaction.
KENNY: Come on, Scotty. This meeting's been on the books for months. It's just a friendly talk on U.S.-Soviet relations. Fortunately, the conversation is cut short as a dozen FLASHBULBS suddenly go off on a dozen cameras as the reporters crush in on the Oval Office, and Reston is swept KENNY'S POV: over the reporters. The President, unsmiling, enters the room beside Soviet Foreign Minister, ANDREI GROMYKO. Gromyko pauses for the photos: grim, dark haired, saturnine.
RESUME: Kenny reacts. At last, the face of the enemy.
THE PRESIDENT: So that there should be no misunderstanding, the position of the United States, which has been made clear by the Attorney General to Ambassador Dobrynin here, I shall read a sentence from my own statement to the press dated September 13th. Should missiles or offensive weapons be placed in Cuba, it would present the gravest threat to U.S. national The President stares at Gromyko as the translator finishes translating. Gromyko sits there, enigmatic, cold, unreadable. The translator finishes, and Gromyko stops him with a gesture so he can answer in his own accented English.
GROMYKO: Mr. President, this will never be done. You need not be concerned. The President hides his fury masterfully, and gazing over his glasses, asks:
THE PRESIDENT: So I do not misunderstand you: there are no offensive weapons in Cuba. A beat. And Gromyko's response is flat, sure, steady:
GROMYKO: No, Mr. President. We have sent defensive weapons only to Cuba. Kenny's blazing eyes could drill holes in the back of Gromyko's head. His gaze swings to the PRESIDENT'S DESK. BENEATH THE DESK sit the BRIEFING BOARDS with the evidence.
BOBBY: What happened? The President comes out of the next door down the hall, the Oval Office. He turns and sees Kenny and Bobby. He's livid.
THE PRESIDENT: Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
BOBBY: We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
THE PRESIDENT: I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
BOBBY: What if I can't?
KENNY: We go into this split, the Russians will know it. And they'll use it against us. The prospect disturbs the three men.
THE PRESIDENT: Have you cancelled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
KENNY: You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
THE PRESIDENT: I don't care. Cancel it.
KENNY: No way. The President spins on him, unsure he heard correctly.
THE PRESIDENT: You're scared to cancel on Daly.
KENNY: Damn right I'm scared. The President pauses, looks at Bobby. Bobby shakes his head: don't look at me.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm not.
BOBBY: Then you'll call, right?
SALINGER: Kenny, all right. What's going on here? There's rumors going around an exercise in the southeast is related to Cuba. I'm the Press Secretary. I can't do my job if I don't know what's going on. So what's going on?
KENNY: What are you telling them?
SALINGER: The truth: I don't know.
KENNY: ( deadly serious ) Tell 'em you've looked into it, and all it is is an exercise. And Pierre ( beat, loaded ) The President may have a cold tomorrow. Kenny stares at him, and the light dawns on Pierre. Something big is going on and he's been cut out of it. He stalks off.
SALINGER: Damn it, Kenny. Goddamn it!
RESTON: There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
KENNY: Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
RESTON: This is about Cuba. Kenny freezes, then explodes.
KENNY: Cuba? You're fucking crazy. We are not invading Cuba. Nobody gives a rat's ass about Cuba. Not now, not ever. If you print something like that, all you're going to do is inflame the situation. Nobody talks to assholes who inflame situations. Assholes like that can find themselves cut out of the loop. Reston is taken aback. Stung silence for a beat. Kenny's response is far louder than any "yes." Now Kenny realizes You've never threatened me before. And Kenny looks away, upset, but when he turns back to Reston, all that's there is his poker face. The elevator All right. I'm not going to print anything until I have another source. But I promise you, I'll get one. Kenny boards the elevator. The doors shut on Scotty.
RESTON: You've never threatened me before. And Kenny looks away, upset, but when he turns back to Reston, all that's there is his poker face. The elevator All right. I'm not going to print anything until I have another source. But I promise you, I'll get one. Kenny boards the elevator. The doors shut on Scotty.
KENNY: ( to Assistant ) Tell Pierre I need to talk to him. ( to phone ) INT. OUTER ROOM - GEORGE BALL'S OFFICE - NIGHT EXCOM files past Bobby out of George Ball's conference room.
BOBBY: Bring him back.
SALINGER: The President has a cold. He is cancelling the remainder of this trip and is returning to Washington on the advice of his doctor.
RUSK: Mr. President, our deliberations have led us to the conclusion that, for the moment, a blockade of offensive weapons to Cuba is our best option. But we'll still need a strong showing of support from the Organization of American States to give us an umbrella of legitimacy. At long last. Kenny looks at Bobby, relieved. They've bought time to find a settlement. Bobby smiles a small smile: what were you so worried about?
MCNAMARA: A blockade is technically an act of war, therefore we recommend calling the action a quarantine. McNamara folder in hand, opens it, SMASH CUTTING US TO:
MCNAMARA: A quarantine prevents more missiles from reaching Cuba, but it doesn't remove the ones already there. It gives the Soviets a chance to pull back without war. If they refuse to remove the missiles before they're operational, we retain the option to strike or invade.
BOBBY: We believe that a surprise attack would be counter to what the United States stands for. We believe that an attack leaves us no room for maneuver, and the inevitable Soviet response will force us into a war we do not want. A war that, this time, will really end all war.
MCCONE: Mr. President, there are still those of us who believe we should proceed with the strikes. With the blockade, we lose strategic surprise and we run the risk of a first strike if the Soviets decide they have to use the missiles or lose The President gazes from one expectant face to another. But he himself remains unreadable.
THE PRESIDENT: Quarantine or air strike. Adlai clears his throat. Everyone looks over at him. He stares down at his clasped hands for a beat. He's anguished about what he's going to say.
ADLAI: There is a third option. With either course we undertake the risk of nuclear war. It seems to me maybe one of us in here should be a coward. He smiles weakly, but gets no response from anyone.
THE PRESIDENT: I don't think that's possible, Adlai. I will be asking the networks for air time Monday night. I have not yet made my final decision. We will announce our course of action then. I want to thank you all for your advice, gentlemen.
BOBBY: Goddman Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
THE PRESIDENT: Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
BOBBY: We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
THE PRESIDENT: We've got bigger problems right now.
KENNY: We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
THE PRESIDENT: I don't know. I don't know. He stares out at the Ellipse where a little-league football game sweeps across the grass, the shouts and screams of the CHILDREN, so alive, floating to them on the wind.
ADLAI: Just can't get away from you guys. Escaping for a night on the town, eh?
KENNY: As the town's most popular playboy, the President felt my presence would be sorely missed. So in the interests of National Security. Kenny shrugs. Adlai takes a long drink, closes his eyes.
ADLAI: Gotta keep up appearances. Of course, I don't care anymore. I'm a political dead man. You ever seen a man cut his own throat like I did today? Kenny has no answer to that. He looks down, pained for Well, it's all right. I came to tell you, just talked to a friend. Reston and Frankel have the story. It's going to run tomorrow.
KENNY: We're not going to make it to Monday. I'll try to lean on Reston, but you're going to have to call Orville Dryfoos. This is the sort of decision the publisher makes himself.
DRYFOOS: Yes, sir, I understand. But we held on Bay of Pigs and it was the biggest mistake of my life. What makes this any INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS The President, on the phone, stops pacing by his bedside table and exhales.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm asking you to hold the story until I can present our course of action on Monday night.
DRYFOOS: All right. But I need a reason to give my boys. They're going to be screaming for my head on a plate.
THE PRESIDENT: Orville. I want you to tell them this: they'll be saving lives. Maybe even including their own.
DRYFOOS: Yes, Mr. President.
KENNY: Acheson called, DeGaulle's with us; haven't heard from anyone else yet. Kenny finally looks up. Bobby's grim. And an icicle forms in Kenny's gut as Bobby relays.
BOBBY: He wants to talk to LeMay again.
THE PRESIDENT: Cam, can you guarantee me you'll get all the missiles? Sweeney glances at LeMay. LeMay's stern, frozen look wills him to say, very simply, "yes." But then the President turns around, looks Sweeney in the eye. It would make Machiavelli himself tell the truth.
GENERAL SWEENEY: Sir, I can guarantee we'll get all the missiles we know about. The President holds Sweeney in his gaze. Thank you.
LEMAY: Mr. President, we can get better than ninety percent of them. The President doesn't respond to LeMay's last-ditch appeal. Ninety-percent isn't good enough with nuclear weapons. He moves to his desk, signs a paper, hands it to General As of seven o'clock Monday night, all United States armed forces world wide will stand up to DEFCON 3.
THE PRESIDENT: As of seven o'clock Monday night, all United States armed forces world wide will stand up to DEFCON 3.
KENNY: You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me. The President exhales, getting control.
THE PRESIDENT: They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me. The President exhales, getting control.
THE PRESIDENT: Good evening, my fellow citizens. This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military build-up on the island of EXT. BARKSDALE AFB - NIGHT The first B-52 trundles to a stop at the end of the runway. It begins to throttle-up, the ROAR of its engine mounting.
THE PRESIDENT: And third: it shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union. The chilling words hang there in the air. BLEEDING IN: the rising and falling WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP which becomes
FADE OUT: BLACKNESS, LIKE BEFORE A CURTAIN RISES. And then a flickering: a FLUORESCENT LIGHT COMES ON.
BOBBY: We're getting the Soviet response.
KENNY: This is all rhetoric. They don't know how to respond yet. Kenny looks up. The President enters from the Oval Office.
THE PRESIDENT: So now you're Khurschev. What do you INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY Kenny, arms folded, stands behind the President, the rest of EXCOM is looking at him.
KENNY: run the blockade. They'll run the ADMIRAL GEORGE ANDERSON, 50s, dapper, the Chief of Naval Operations, nods from the far end of the table.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
MCNAMARA: We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
MCCONE: Or they could use it as an excuse to Admiral Anderson, if the ships do not stop, what exactly are our rules of Anderson signals A BRIEFING OFFICER who hits the lights and an overhead projector which SMASH CUTS TO:
BOBBY: Admiral Anderson, if the ships do not stop, what exactly are our rules of Anderson signals A BRIEFING OFFICER who hits the lights and an overhead projector which SMASH CUTS TO:
BOBBY: What happens if the ship doesn't stop for inspection or want to be towed?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: A warning shot will be fired across its Bobby stops, stares directly at the Admiral.
BOBBY: And what happens if the ship ignores the warning shot?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Then we fire at its rudder, disable it, and carry out the inspection. Kenny looks at the President who remains unmoved, unreadable.
THE PRESIDENT: There will be no shooting without my explicit orders. Is that understood?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Yes, sir. The President glances at McNamara.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, Admiral, it looks like it's up to the Navy.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: The Navy won't let you down, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: General, have we developed any more information on the missiles?
GENERAL TAYLOR: They are continuing to proceed with the development. We're commencing low-level photography runs this morning.
MCCONE: The pictures will be used to firm up our estimates of the missiles' readiness and develop target packages for strikes should you order them.
GENERAL TAYLOR: Our guy running this show is the best. Commander Bill Ecker of the Navy's VFP 62, the Fightin' Photo. Something of a character, but the highest efficiency ratings we've ever had. He pushes Ecker's personnel file across the table, and as the President opens it, on ECKER'S PHOTO, we SMASH CUT TO:
ECKER: 75 millimeter, I'm listening. On the big screen there's nothing like it. The other pilots heckle him, but are muted by Taylor.
WILHEMY: Watch out, Hollywood. There's a new epic director in town!
GENERAL TAYLOR: We have a flight of Thunderchiefs able to respond within minutes of an attack on our planes. Kenny catches the President's eye. Kenny glances at the door. Step outside, I need to talk to you.
KENNY: I don't like what's happening.
THE PRESIDENT: In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows.
KENNY: All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows.
THE PRESIDENT: I know, I know.
KENNY: What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
THE PRESIDENT: We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple. Kenny's right, and the President looks away in frustration.
KENNY: Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple. Kenny's right, and the President looks away in frustration.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm gonna protect those pilots. Thep President stares intently at Kenny. Kenny glances at the door, his voice hushed. He hesitates.
KENNY: They're boxing us in with these rules of engagement. If you agree to 'em, and one of our planes gets knocked down or one of the ships won't stop for inspection, the Chiefs will have us by the balls and will force us to start shooting. They want a war, and they're arranging things to get one. If you don't want one, we have to do something about it. The President understands. He shakes his head, paces away.
THE PRESIDENT: How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right. The President turns away, considers. Then turns back.
KENNY: Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right. The President turns away, considers. Then turns back.
THE PRESIDENT: Triple check everything the Chiefs say to us with the guys who actually have to do it. No one's to know about this but Bobby. I need redundant control over what happens out there. And if things aren't as advertised, you're going to make sure they come out the way I want them to come out, starting with this low level flight thing. Jesus Christ.Kenny is daunted. For a beat he just stares.
KENNY: That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. INT. WEST WING HALLS - DAY Kenny and the President head for the Cabinet Room. Rusk comes out before they get there.
THE PRESIDENT: Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. INT. WEST WING HALLS - DAY Kenny and the President head for the Cabinet Room. Rusk comes out before they get there.
RUSK: Mr. President. The OAS meeting starts in an hour. I haven't prepared at all. We can't expect
THE PRESIDENT: we need this one, Dean. The quarantine's legal if we get a mandate, otherwise it's an act of war in the eyes of the world. Get me that vote. Make it unanimous.
RUSK: Mr. President, The Organization of American States hasn't had a unanimous vote since The President moves for the Cabinet Room.
THE PRESIDENT: unanimous, Dean. Kenny slaps the dismayed Rusk on the back, heads off down a hall away from the Cabinet Room.
MARGARET: White House Operator. Yes sir. Speaker McCormack, hold for the Vice Her voice is so severe, so smoker-gravelled, it makes the blood run cold. This is the woman Kenny's looking for.
KENNY: Ma'am, would you mind helping me out with a few special calls?
ECKER: Orson Welles is a hack. Now you want to talk about a director, you talk about David Lean.
WILHEMY: Welles is a G-d. Lean's the hack.
ECKER: Bullshit, Bruce, nobody but Lean is making decent movies these days. Get that fixed yet? Nearby, a YOUNG PILOT tinkers with a $300,000 spy camera.
YOUNG PILOT: Uhhh. yup. Think so. Suddenly, the door opens and a pale DUTY SERGEANT enters.
DUTY SERGEANT: Sir.telephone, sir.
ECKER: VFP-62, Fightin' Photo, here. But what we really want to do is direct.
MARGARET: This is the White House Operator. Hold for the President.
ECKER: Oh shit.
MARGARET: Honey, you don't know what shit is.
BEGIN INTERCUT: INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Kenny, sitting on his desk, taps his fingers, looks at the phone. He's kept Ecker on hold long enough - and picks up.
KENNY: Commander, my name is Ken O'Donnell. Special Assistant to the President.
ECKER: Yes, sir.
ECKER: Uh. we'll do our best, sir.
KENNY: I don't think you understand me correctly. You are not to get shot down under any circumstances. Whatever happens up there, you were not shot at. Mechanical failures are fine; crashing into mountains, fine. But you and your men are not to be shot at, fired at, launched upon.
ECKER: Excuse me, sir, what's going on here?
KENNY: Commander, if you are fired upon, the President will be forced to attack the sites that fire on you. He doesn't want to have to do that. It's very important that he doesn't, or things could go very badly out of control.
ECKER: I think I understand. What about my men? If it comes up hot and heavy, and we don't have anyone to protect us. I'm going to be writing letters to parents. I hate writing letters to INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Kenny nods to himself, feeling. He's done it himself.
KENNY: If the President protects you, Commander, he may have to do it with the INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Ecker doesn't want to be avenged with atomic weapons. No sane person would.
ECKER: Okay, Mr. O'Donnell. We'll do what we END INTERCUT. As Ecker hangs up, the Duty Officer rips off the ORDERS, hands them to Ecker, who takes one look, then gazes out the window at the runway
ECKER: Get that fuel assayed?
WILHEMY: Yeah. It sucks. Ain't for high performance babies like ours. Shoulda brought some from home, but what can you do? Last-second deployments. Wilhemy jumps off, then they're at Ecker's plane, and he jumps off. Too late to worry about bad fuel now. He hoists himself up and into the cockpit of the sleek navy jet.
ECKER: Okay, time to play Spin the Bottle with our bearded buddy. Nobody gets out ahead. Remember, just sitting here we're only ten minutes from target.
ECKER: Go to military throttle on my mark. Three.two.one. mark. His airspeed indicator spins up to 400 knots. And then his radio suddenly crackles:
ECKER: Get some altitude! Two of the Crusaders pull up, away from the water.
ECKER: Affirmative. You two get out of here.
ECKER: Start your camera checks. A mechanical WHINE accompanies the switch-throwing. Ecker pulls the trigger on his joystick and a THUMP THUMP THUMP hammers away. There are green lights across his boards. One of the other pilots cuts in on the radio:
ECKER: Scrub, you two. Get out of here. Still with me, Bruce?
WILHEMY: Holy shit!
ECKER: And sees the long, canvas-covered objects on the ground. The missiles. They draw closer.
WILHEMY: You shoulda seen it, Chief, they
ECKER: damn sparrows. Must've been migrating. Guess I hit a couple ( to Wilhemy, stern ) How many did you hit, Bruce? Wilhemy stands there, looking at Ecker, not sure what to make of him. The Crew Chief just starts laughing as more impressed GROUND CREW come up.
WILHEMY: A few. I guess.
ECKER: Those are bird strikes. Sparrows to be precise. Got a problem with that? The Chief stands there, glances at the plane one more time, and shakes his head, 'No.' Ecker takes the Chief's maintenance clipboard from him, writes in big bold marker: BIRD STRIKES. He thrusts it back into the Chief's hands and walks off; the astonished Wilhemy remains behind.
KENNY: INT. OAS MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS George Ball stands at the back of a crowded room filled with applauding OAS DELEGATES. It's for Rusk, at a podium up
BALL: Kenny. The vote just came down.
RUSK: Unanimous. One abstenation. And then he breaks into a huge grin. Everyone cheers him.
THE PRESIDENT: About time something went our way. An Assistant enters behind Kenny. Kenny senses him, turns as the others move to shake hands with Rusk.
ASSISTANT: Telephone, Mr. O'Donnell.
KENNY: INTERCUT CALL TO: INT. READY ROOM - CECIL FIELD - DAY Ecker stands at a phone, stares out a window at a replacement plane being fueled. A Crusader, not his shot-up one.
ECKER: Mr. O'Donnell, I've been ordered to deliver the film to the Pentagon personally. What's going on?
KENNY: The Chiefs must want to talk to you. Listen to me, Commander, they'll want to know if you were fired on. Were you?
KENNY: Commander. Do not, under any circumstances, tell the Chiefs.
END INTERCUT: INT. PENTAGON - DAY SUPER: E-RING. Then SUPER: THE PENTAGON Ecker, still in his sweat-drenched flight suit approaches a security checkpoint. GUARDS secure his sidearm and user him through a doorway. A sign over it reads JCS.
ECKER: Commander William B. Ecker reporting as LeMay rises, prowls over to Ecker.
LEMAY: Son , I want to know just one thing. Those bastards shoot so much as a BB gun at you? A long beat. Sweat runs off Ecker's head. He can smell LeMay's breath.
ECKER: Sir, it was a milk run, sir.
GENERAL TAYLOR: It appears our low-level flights are getting back okay. Some unconfirmed reports of small-arms fire from some of the missions, but that's it. Slightly behind them, Kenny looks sidelong at Taylor.
THE PRESIDENT: Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
GENERAL TAYLOR: Still heading for Cuba.
THE PRESIDENT: All right. Then I guess it's time.
THE PRESIDENT: In accordance with this afternoon's vote at the OAS, the quarantine shall hereby be effective as of ten o'clock tomorrow Kenny observes in silence as the President SIGNS the Proclamation of Interdiction.
THE PRESIDENT: Last summer I read a book. The Guns of August. I wish every man on that blockade line had read that book. The President moves over to the GLOBE by his desk, spins it, stopping in on Europe.
KENNY: I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
KENNY: Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
KENNY: I'll be evacuated with the President. A long silence on the other end of the line.
KENNY: I'll find you. But we're not going to let it come to that. I promise.
KENNY: Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
BUNDY: I just checked myself. They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there. Bobby looks at his coffee, then up at Kenny. He gently shakes his head. It's all a sham.
BOBBY: Course that's for morale. The missiles only take five minutes to get here.
POLICE OFFICER: Would you like me to call a car, Mr. Kenny checks his watch.
KENNY: How long will it take to get someone up?
POLICE OFFICER: Fifteen minutes, maybe. To your house, Kenny considers, shakes his head. He wants to go home, No. No, I'll let her sleep. Let 'em Kenny says it with a certain finality. The Police Officer nods, and Kenny wanders out through the gates, shouldering the weight of the world.
KENNY: No. No, I'll let her sleep. Let 'em Kenny says it with a certain finality. The Police Officer nods, and Kenny wanders out through the gates, shouldering the weight of the world.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay, Bob, I'm putting you on intercom. Suddenly, McNamara's VOICE fills the room.
MCNAMARA: I have one minute til ten here
THE PRESIDENT: Bob, the quarantine is now in effect.
MCNAMARA: Then it looks like our first customers are the Gagarin and Kimovsk. He nods to Admiral Anderson, who calls an order down to a Watch Officer on the floor, and on screens all around the room, a sector of the map MAGNIFIES the unfolding encounter
CAPTAIN: Helm, shape heading for intercept, zero one zero. All ahead full
CHIEF SONARMAN: Submerged contact, designation Sierra one at 6000 yards bearing 030.
CAPTAIN: A submarine.
GENERAL TAYLOR: It's protecting the freighters. Consternation. The President picks up the phone.
THE PRESIDENT: Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
THE PRESIDENT: Put me through to the Pierce.
CAPTAIN: Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: Captain, can you force that submarine to the surface for inspection without damaging it yourself?
CAPTAIN: I can bring it up, Mr. President. But whether it's damaged or not is up to the INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS The President lowers the phone, looks to Bobby and Kenny.
MCCONE: Even if they force it up, that sub will be inspected over the crews' dead bodies. They'd be executed for allowing it when they got home. All eyes are on the President. His eyes are closed tight, face gray, hand over his mouth. The time of decision is at hand. He lifts the phone once again.
THE PRESIDENT: Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
THE PRESIDENT: ( to phone ) Captain, belay that order! ( to McNamara ) Bob, where's that coming from!
THE PRESIDENT: Will somebody find out what's going on?! McCone jumps up, leaves the room. The President looks at Kenny, tense. Everyone holds their breath.
RUSK: Are they stopping? The HISS of static on the open line fills the room. Silence.
MCNAMARA: we've got reports coming from all over! The ships are stopping! Some. are turning around!
RUSK: We were eyeball to eyeball and I think the other fellow just blinked. The ruckus goes on for a minute. McCone comes back in.
MCCONE: Mr. President. His voice is lost in the celebration. McCone calls out:
THE PRESIDENT: Captain, have the ships you're observing changed course?
BOBBY: It's an accident. They must not have gotten their orders yet. Let 'em go.
GENERAL TAYLOR: Unlikely, Mr. President. We've been monitoring transmissions from both the Gagarin and Kimovsk. Their radios are working fine.
MCCONE: One ship, an accident maybe. Six: this is intentional. The President looks to Bobby. He has no answer. Kenny's mind races over the variables, and he leans forward, intense, suddenly understanding in a flash of insight:
KENNY: They're right. This is intentional. He glances around the room. All of EXCOM is looking at him. Bobby stares at Kenny, too shocked to feel betrayed.
MCCONE: If we do, it erodes the credibility of the quarantine. He'll just send more through tomorrow. The President looks at Kenny.
KENNY: Then we deal with it tomorrow. But today he's stopped most of them. He's done something smart here. We gave him an ultimatum, and he's agreed to most of it, preserving just enough room to save face. We need to do something just as smart now. Bobby's nodding, following the argument. Kenny looks around the room for support.
MCNAMARA: Mr. President, I agree. Let them go. Four of the six continuing ships are still a day away from the line. They've stopped all the ones we suspect have weapons aboard. It would look bad shooting up a freighter full of baby food.
THE PRESIDENT: Captain, I want you to maintain contact with those ships. Do nothing until I order otherwise. Is that clear?
THE PRESIDENT: I hope you're right.
BOBBY: What happened to speak when spoken to?
KENNY: Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat. Bobby likes getting under Kenny's skin. Bobby aims a punch at his head which Kenny knocks away. The President changes gear, serious.
THE PRESIDENT: We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
KENNY: Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
BOBBY: We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
THE PRESIDENT: McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
KENNY: Then let's move the quarantine line. It's a simple suggestion. The President considers him a beat, and then McNamara emerges from the White House, heads for them. The three friends assume their more reserved, political faces as he comes up.
MCNAMARA: Mr. President. Bobby. Kenny. The Essex battle group has the Gagarin, Kimovsk and the sub escort under their thumb. We've got a few hours now before we need to worry about any more flashpoints on the line. We could use a few more hours. I think we should consider moving the quarantine line back to 500 miles. Bobby and the President look at Kenny like he's some kind of Svengali. Kenny just stands there, poker faced.
KENNY: Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
MCNAMARA: ( snappish ) Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually. They turn a corner, silence for a beat.
KENNY: The Chiefs are looking for a provocation out there. The President's going to come under enormous pressure. You have to keep 'em on a short leash, Bob. McNamara spares Kenny a short, nasty look.
MCNAMARA: You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
KENNY: Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs
MCNAMARA: you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President ( beat ) Besides me. That gets an amused snort from McNamara, breaking the Anybody ever tell you you're an egomaniac and a prick, O'Donnell? Kenny stares him in the eye, serious, hushed. A friend.
KENNY: You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President Besides me. That gets an amused snort from McNamara, breaking the Anybody ever tell you you're an egomaniac and a prick, O'Donnell? Kenny stares him in the eye, serious, hushed. A friend.
MCNAMARA: Anybody ever tell you you're an egomaniac and a prick, O'Donnell? Kenny stares him in the eye, serious, hushed. A friend.
KENNY: You need to be the best you've ever McNamara enters the elevator. He turns, stands there facing Kenny for a dramatic beat. Then the doors close.
KENNY: Find out how close our exercises are coming to their cruise missiles. I'm calling you back in five, and you will have an answer for me or I will come down there and beat the shit out of you. Then you can press charges, and I'll get a Presidential pardon. He hangs up, hears SHOUTING from the Oval Office. He goes to the door, enters
THE PRESIDENT: how the goddamn hell did this happen? I'm going to have Power's head on a platter next to LeMay's! ( noticing Kenny ) Hey, Kenny, did you hear me give the order to go to DEFCON 2? I remember giving the order to go to DEFCON 3, but I must be suffering from amnesia because I've just been informed our nuclear forces are DEFCON 2! Kenny realizes he's not joking as he spots Bobby sitting on the couch behind Taylor, pale as a ghost. Taylor, embattled, wants to die, but stands there like a man.
CLOSE ON: The nose cone of a TITAN MISSILE, its 20 megaton nuclear warhead wrapped in the steel re-entry shell. Cold, silent,
GENERAL TAYLOR: Technically, General LeMay is correct that SAC has the statutory authority The President punches his desk.
THE PRESIDENT: I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
GENERAL TAYLOR: We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
THE PRESIDENT: General, the Joint Chiefs have just signalled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signalled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve. But Taylor knows this very well. And the way he's suffering, it's clear he's taking the heat for his underlings. From over on the couch Bobby chimes in:
BOBBY: LeMay. he's history. The President glances at Kenny who stands there, speechless.
THE PRESIDENT: Get out of here, Max. The General leaves. Kenny closes the door, wanders deeper into the office. He looks from the President to Bobby. There's a long, long beat of shocked silence.
KENNY: Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
BOBBY: Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
KENNY: We can't do that, Bobby.
THE PRESIDENT: He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
KENNY: And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted Bobby is disgusted, but knows they're right.
BOBBY: McNamara won't be able to handle them. It's too much for one man. .with all due respect to our heroic fifth column. The President collapses in his rocking chair. Kenny leans over the back of the sofa next to Bobby.
KENNY: We've got Khruschev's attention with the blockade. If we want a political solution. I think it's time to turn up the diplomatic heat. Cause if we let this go on too long, we're going to find ourselves in a war. Bobby looks at the President, meaningful. The President turns to Kenny.
THE PRESIDENT: I've been considering a variation on one of Stevenson's ideas. We're going to send up a trial balloon through Lippman. The Jupiter missiles.
BUNDY: What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
KENNY: I think it's a bad idea. Bundy turns back to him.
BUNDY: Thank God. Look, everyone is furious about it. We trade away our missiles in Turkey and we're fucked politically. Kenny grinds his jaw, but doesn't say anything. He agrees. Bundy steps up to him, confiding.
KENNY: Then they should speak up.
BUNDY: Christ, Ken, you know it's not that Yes it is.
KENNY: Yes it is.
BUNDY: No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you. Kenny prickles, intense, but Bundy presses on, too wrapped up in his own thinking to notice.
KENNY: You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
BUNDY: You know I don't mean they're weak. Kenny gets in his face, intimidating.
KENNY: No, they just lack 'moral toughness.' And you think I'll play your Judas. You WASPS and blue-bloods never understood us, thinking we want into your club. Well we got our own club now. And you guys don't realize fighting with each other is our way. Nobody plays us off each other. And nobody ever gets between us.
THE PRESIDENT: What's that?
KENNY: Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in The President's eyes flick over to him in the mirror.
THE PRESIDENT: I don't want to listen to this again.
KENNY: If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
THE PRESIDENT: It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
KENNY: Then somebody'd better deny it publicly. The President turns around, heads over to the T.V. Kenny folds his arms, disgusted.
THE PRESIDENT: Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
KENNY: Yeah, a good political solution.
RESUME: The President's jaw tightens. He turns to Kenny.
THE PRESIDENT: You want to turn up the heat? You call Adlai. Tell him to stick it to Zorin.
BOBBY: Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
KENNY: You can't take him out this late in the Zorin will eat him alive!
BOBBY: Zorin will eat him alive!
KENNY: Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
BOBBY: What's gotten into you? Kenny throws the Lippman article at him.
KENNY: Something your father would've come up Silence. Terrible silence. That paralyzes Bobby. Kenny stares at him. He means it, but regrets it, too.
BOBBY: My father
KENNY: I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad. But Bobby gets it. Kenny shifts gears, lets it go.
BOBBY: He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
ADLAI: INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Kenny turns to gaze at his little T.V. in the credenza, U.N. coverage continuing, as if he could see Adlai there.
KENNY: Adlai, it's Kenny. How're you doing?
ADLAI: Busy, Ken. What do you need?
KENNY: The President told me to pass the word to you: stick it to them.
KENNY: Adlai. The world has to know we're right. If we're going to have a chance at a political solution, we need international pressure. You got to be tough, Adlai. You need to find it, old INT. U.S. OFFICES - U.N. - CONTINUOUS Adlai watches his Staffers leave his inner office. He hears Kenny, and everything Kenny is saying.
ADLAI: I hear you. I'm glad it's you calling. I thought it would be Bobby. If they're still sticking to their stonewall strategy, I'll get 'em. Thanks, Ken. Adlai lowers the phone to its cradle. An ANXIOUS STAFFER sticks his head in the door, a concerned, questioning look on his face. Adlai adjusts his tie. HIS HAND IS SHAKING. He notices it, and manages a brave smile.
ADLAI: Wait here. And then a DOORMAN throws open the door for him.
ROMANIAN DELEGATE: ( through translator ) .we call upon the world to condemn this purely American provocation. But as the Romanian wheezes on, all eyes are on Adlai. Adlai takes his seat, his Staffers behind him. They pass him up papers, and he spreads them before him, taking no notice that the entire room is staring at him. Adlai finally glances up. Across the circle sits Zorin, in the flesh, at the head of his own tough-looking DELEGATION. He acknowledges Adlai with a superior smile.
ZORIN: ( through translator ) We are glad you could join us, Mr. Adlai nods, returns to his notes, as Zorin continues.
BOBBY: I make the call, and Adlai is out. McCloy goes in. Bobby looks back at Kenny.
THE PRESIDENT: Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
ZORIN: The United States has no facts in hand. Falsity is what America has in its hands - false evidence. Zorin leans back in his chair. Adlai finally looks up. He meets Zorin's icy bravura. He notes the cameras around the room. This is the grandest stage of all.
ADLAI: Well, let me say something to you, Mr. Ambassador, we do have the evidence. We have it, and it is clear and Adlai's tone is definitive. A tremor of interest passes through the various delegations.
BUNDY: Come on, Adlai! They all crowd the T.V. as if it were a title fight. Except for Bobby. Kenny glances over at him. He has the phone pinned between his ear and shoulder. Kenny looks back to the
ADLAI: Mr. Zorin, I remind you that the other day you did not deny the existence of these weapons. But today, again, if I heard you correctly, you now say they do not exist. Zorin, headphones on, listens to his own translation, but doesn't respond, acts bored. It gets Adlai's goat, and he begins to lose his cool. A rumble from the U.N. The CAMERA FINDS Adlai's hand SHAKING, gripping his pen.
RUSK: Come on, Adlai, don't let him off!
BOBBY: John? It's Bobby. Get ready to send your staffer in. He's going to be coming out.
ADLAI: All right, sir. Let me ask you one simple question. Do you, Ambassador Zorin, deny that the U.S.S.R. has placed and is placing medium and intermediate range missiles and sites in Cuba? Yes or no - don't wait for the translation - yes or no? The diplomatic world GASPS as Adlai drops all pretense of civility, all statesman-like grace.
KENNY: Yeah. Yeah.
ZORIN: I am not in an American courtroom, sir, and therefore I do not wish to answer a question that is put to me in the fashion in which a prosecutor puts questions. In due course, sir, you will have your answer. There's laughter at Zorin's refusal to be bullied: but it's nervous laughter, not the polite stuff of diplomatic tete-a tete. The RUMBLE in the room grows louder.
ADLAI: You are in the courtroom of world opinion right now, and you can answer yes or no. You have denied they exist, and I want to know if I have understood you correctly.
BOBBY: John, I'll get back to you. He lowers the phone to the receiver. Kenny shoots him a triumphant smile. The President looks at Kenny, shakes his head, a big smile on his face.
ADLAI: And I'm prepared to present the evidence in this room, proving that the Soviet Union has lied to the world. And Zorin cracks. He looks uneasily to his delegation. They bend forward to consult. Adlai sits back in his chair, draping his arms over its wings with the confidence of someone who knows he's kicked ass. Adlai looks around the room while he's waiting for his answer, managing not to smile. The diplomatic world is scandalized. At last Zorin regroups, lifts his head from his If you do not choose to continue your statement, the Chair recognizes the representative from Chile. The CHILEAN DELEGATE stands.
ZORIN: If you do not choose to continue your statement, the Chair recognizes the representative from Chile. The CHILEAN DELEGATE stands.
CHILEAN DELEGATE: I yield my time and the floor to the representative to the United States. The room explodes in laughter. Not just nervous any more, not just polite. They're laughing at Zorin's parliamentary ploy blowing up in his face. Zorin's smile is gone, his smooth facade destroyed. And he looks like the biggest fool in the world. Adlai stares at the beet-faced man with disdain. At last, Adlai stands, gestures to the door to the hall behind him. The PHOTO INTERPRETERS come racing in with their briefing Well then, ladies and gentlemen, since it appears we might be here for a while, shall we have a look at what the Soviets are doing in Cuba? The Delegates RUMBLE in interest, rise from their seats to approach Adlai.
ADLAI: Well then, ladies and gentlemen, since it appears we might be here for a while, shall we have a look at what the Soviets are doing in Cuba? The Delegates RUMBLE in interest, rise from their seats to approach Adlai.
THE PRESIDENT: Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
KENNY: Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time. Bundy steps forward, holding the phone.
BUNDY: Mr. President. Kenny and the President turn to see what they already have heard in those two words: concern. The room falls quiet.
MCNAMARA: .the ship is called Groznyy.
MCNAMARA: It crossed the line hours ago. Admiral Anderson, on the phone on the level below, is tense.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Hail them again.
MCNAMARA: We're kidding ourselves. And not only that, in his bleary, sleep-deprived fog, he begins to understand something happening down there. The CAMERA MOVES over the enormous map, over the scrolling cryptic numerology. THE BUZZ of radio communications bleeds in from the background. The overhead platform swivels on its motor, like the vast arm of some fate-writing god as the Watch Officer on it updates the movements of the ships. McNamara stares, at the verge of grasping something. Through the door-crack of genius, he has the glimpse of some grander thing, some grander design.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Very well. Load your guns. That starts McNamara from his fatigued reverie. He goes to the railing, looks down on Anderson.
MCNAMARA: What was that, Admiral? Anderson turns, gazes up from his tier below, distracted.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
MCNAMARA: What are you doing?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
MCNAMARA: Admiral, I asked you a question. Anderson holds the phone aside, turns around again, looks up at him, impatient. His answer is hard, cold, dangerous.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: We're going to follow the Rules of Engagement. The Rules of Engagement which the President has approved and signed in his order of October 23rd. Anderson listens again to the phone.
MCNAMARA: EXT. OCEAN, PUERTO RICO TRENCH - CONTINUOUS The Destroyer's forward 5-inch twin guns swivel, train on the Groznyy. A beat. They OPEN FIRE with an ear-splitting BAMBAM, ripping the air in front of the muzzles, the Groznyy so close a miss isn't possible.
MCNAMARA: GODDAMNIT, STOP THAT FIRING! Watch Officers scramble to comply, chaos and shouting in the war room as a chorus if "Cease fire cease fire cease fire," goes up. McNamara turns on Anderson, is in his face.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: That ship was firing starshells. Starshells. Flares, Mr. Secretary. Everyone's eyes are on the two men. Only the chatter of teletype breaks the paralyzing silence. McNamara blinks, looks down at the plot on the floor. Anderson's voice drops to a deadly sotto.
MCNAMARA: ADMIRAL ANDERSON Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones. McNamara turns back. And all trepidation, embarrassment, hesitation are gone. He coldly appraises Anderson.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones. McNamara turns back. And all trepidation, embarrassment, hesitation are gone. He coldly appraises Anderson.
MCNAMARA: I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
MCNAMARA: This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Yes, sir.
MCNAMARA: And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President. John Paul Jones. you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral? He passes his hand over the enormous plot below.
RUSK: Kenny, we need to see the President. Something's happened. Kenny reacts to Rusk's enigmatic expression. And out from behind Rusk steps JOHN SCALI, the ABC News Correspondent.
SCALI: I have lunch with him maybe once a month. Way he talks, he acts like he knows Khruschev personally, but he's never elaborated. I've used him as a source in a couple of stories. Kenny paces behind the gathered men around the President's desk, listening, mind going a million miles an hour.
RUSK: The FBI has identified this Alexander Fomin as the Soviet Resident, the KGB equivalent of one of our station chiefs. He's their highest ranking spy in this country. And he knows John's a friend of mine.
BUNDY: All the trademarks of a back-channel Kenny eyes Bundy, makes him uncomfortable. The President sizes Scali up.
THE PRESIDENT: So they'll remove the missiles, and we'll pledge not to invade Cuba, destabilize Castro or assist anyone who plans in doing so. Nobody dares speak. It's as if the possibility of a settlement will vanish into thin air if anyone moves.
BOBBY: I think. this may be our first real message from Khruschev.
MCCONE: The alternative, Mr. President, is that this could be a trap.
KENNY: Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short.
MCCONE: Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
KENNY: That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
MCCONE: That may be what they want us to think.
RUSK: The truth is, Mr. President, we don't even really know whom Fomin speaks for. It could be Khruschev. It could be some faction in the Politburo or the KGB itself. We just don't know.
BOBBY: By the way, Scali, your activities now fall under the secrecy codicils of the National Security Act. Sorry, no The gathered men chuckle, only Scali a bit dour but being a good sport about it. Scali checks his watch.
SCALI: Mr. President, we don't have much time. I'm supposed to meet with him again in three and a half hours.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, it seems the question of the day is is the offer legitimate? He moves away from his desk. The men watch him.
GENERAL TAYLOR: Mr. President, I'm afraid we have some bad news. We're getting GMAIC estimates from our latest low-level overflights. It appears the missiles are two to three days away from operational status.
MCCONE: So we don't have much time to play out back-channel communiques. Kenny gives Bobby a hard look. The President appears The quarantine, sir, is not producing results. The Chiefs feel it's time you take another look at our options. The President considers Taylor, then looks over to Kenny.
GENERAL TAYLOR: The quarantine, sir, is not producing results. The Chiefs feel it's time you take another look at our options. The President considers Taylor, then looks over to Kenny.
THE PRESIDENT: Kenny, get over to your old stomping grounds. Go through everything the FBI has on Fomin. I need your best call: is this guy legit and is he speaking for Khruschev? And I need you to tell me by the time I call you, because right after I call you, I'm calling Scali with his INT. FBI, COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT FILES - NIGHT BANG! A STACK OF FILES slams down beside Kenny on a large paper-covered conference table. WALTER SHERIDAN, Kenny's investigator-buddy, wears a visitor's pass just like Kenny. Kenny and Walter RIFLE through the folders, super fast, super proficient. A half-dozen FBI AGENTS work around the table.
SHERIDAN: Okay. So, what we've got is this guy Alexander Feklisov, aka Alexander Fomin, declared Consul to the Soviet Embassy, but in reality the KGB Papa Spy. An illustrious tour of duty during the Great Patriotic War gets him on the Party fast track, various tours of duty in KGB, American postings. He's an expert on us, and. that's all we've got on Papa Spy.
KENNY: Who's he talking for? Is it Khruschev, or is this more bullshit? Kenny stands, runs his hands through his hair, aggravated.
SHERIDAN: Gotta know someone. Kenny whirls on Sheridan. A frozen beat.
KENNY: Politics is politics. Walter. Khruschev is the Moscow Party Boss under Stalin. Give me their career Walter pushes a typed dateline of Khruschev's major career moves, and one of the Agents hands Kenny a list of Fomin's postings. He lays them side by side. And for every step of Khruschev's, there's a step for Fomin. Not only that, but the DATES ARE IDENTICAL or nearly so.
KENNY: They know each other. They're war It's thin. But real life usually is. A PHONE on the table SHRILLS, shattering the silent triumph.
SHERIDAN: It's thin. But real life usually is. A PHONE on the table SHRILLS, shattering the silent triumph.
KENNY: THE PRESIDENT ( O.S. ) I've got to move. What do you have, They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
KENNY: They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
KENNY: Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence. Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
SCALI: I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
FOMIN: So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
SCALI: That is correct.
FOMIN: This is from the Highest Authority?
SCALI: Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
FOMIN: And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast. Scali demurs. He has no instructions on this count.
SCALI: Time is of the essence. Scali takes a sip of coffee. Fomin stares at him, intense.
FOMIN: John. How much time?
SCALI: 48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT Scali finishes debriefing the President, Bobby, Kenny, McCone, Taylor and Bundy.
SCALI: He left right away. Got the feeling he meant business. Kenny and Bobby share a hopeful glance. Rusk enters from Kenny's office. And he's unable to contain his excitement.
RUSK: Mr. President, we're receiving a letter from Khruschev over at State.
TRANSLATOR: INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT Kenny slams a page of Khruschev's letter on the table. He jabs his finger at it. EXCOM listens, intent.
KENNY: It's ten pages of sentimental fluff, but he's saying right here. He'll remove the missiles in return for a no-invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin's overture was genuine. The President turns to McCone.
MCCONE: Our early analysis says this was probably written by Khruschev himself. It's a first draft, and shows no signs of being polished by the foreign ministry. In fact, it probably hasn't been approved by the Politburo. They wouldn't have let the emotionalism go by. The analysts say it was written by someone under considerable stress. EXCOM chuckles.
THE PRESIDENT: Glad to hear we're not alone. The President eyes the EXCOM members one by one, an incipient smile on his face.
KENNY: Helen rises, her own care-worn face turned to his. For a silent moment they gaze at each other, searching in the lines of each others' face for the changes of a long separation. They see them. But they've been married a long time, and the awkwardness passes.
HELEN: Hi, O'Donnell. You look old. Kenny drops his coat on a table as Helen comes up and folds herself into his arms.
KENNY: we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
HELEN: A thing like this. who could even think of winning?
BOBBY: Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
KENNY: Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
BOBBY: We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
BOBBY: We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
KENNY: What does the letter say?
BOBBY: They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time. Kenny is stunned.
MCCONE: My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was. The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
KENNY: Jesus Christ. Bobby gives him a look: told you things got worse.
THE PRESIDENT: It doesn't necessarily mean there's been a coup. Khruschev's name is signed to the letter.
RUSK: It doesn't necessarily mean there's been a coup. Khruschev's name is signed to the letter.
MCNAMARA: Aw, come on, Dean!
RUSK: But at the very least. It does suggest he's been co-opted by hard line Which at the end of the day is the same thing as a coup. A puppet Khruschev, and a hard-line Soviet government pulling the strings. No deal. And the missiles are almost operational. Bitter silence. They all look to the President. Imminent victory has turned to ashes. The President studies his own folded hands. Ball and Thompson enter, take seats. One by one, throughout the scene, other EXCOM members join the You know, the problem we have is that this is latest offer of theirs will seem reasonable to everyone. We remove our missiles, they remove theirs. Our Jupiters were scheduled for removal anyway. They're obsolete, after all. Kenny shakes his head in mute anger. McNamara and Rusk seem to sense the President's feelings, too.

RUSK: Mr. President, agreeing to such a trade would be tantamount to paying ransom. They'll put a gun to our head again, and expect us to pay again. Kenny looks the President in the eye.
KENNY: We can't sell out one of our friends for our own safety. NATO wouldn't trust us anymore, and they'd be right not to. The President sighs in the face of the stern advice. He nods, expecting as much. Bobby still can't look at anyone.
THE PRESIDENT: So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
GENERAL TAYLOR: Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all. Everyone of Kenny's instincts jumps. His head snaps up to listen to Taylor. Taylor pauses.
MCNAMARA: Designed to keep us from taking action. Kenny hears the fatalism in McNamara's voice. A long beat. Everyone stares at McNamara.
LUNDAHL: Mr. President. Lundahl stands there at the end of the table, gray. He almost can't say it, can't look the President in the face.
MCNAMARA: Then we're out of time. We have to go That may not be as easy as we thought either. We've gotten confirmation that the Soviets have also deployed battlefield nuclear weapons to Cuba. A pall falls over the room as LeMay explains.
LUNDAHL: That may not be as easy as we thought either. We've gotten confirmation that the Soviets have also deployed battlefield nuclear weapons to Cuba. A pall falls over the room as LeMay explains.
LEMAY: FROGS, we call 'em. Short range tactical nukes. It's possible they've delegated release authority to their local commanders for use against our invasion troops. It'd be standard Our capability to get all the missiles has eroded during our delay with the quarantine. The good news is that for the moment we know where the FROGS are, and we can target them, too. But the longer we wait, the hard it's going to They all look to the President. Kenny stares, in a private hell, blacker and more complete than anyone should ever know. In that shocked silence each man grapples with failure. The Best and the Brightest could not prevent what must come next.
THE PRESIDENT: Then we have no choice. General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
GENERAL TAYLOR: Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes. The President gives Kenny a meaningful look.
THE PRESIDENT: Permission granted. Taylor exits. Kenny rises, gives the President an almost imperceptible nod, as he prepares to leave in Taylor's wake.
MAJOR ANDERSON: This is Major Anderson.
KENNY: Major, my name is Kenneth O'Donnell. Special Assistant to the President. Kenny takes a breath, ready to start the shuck-and-jive. but for some reason doesn't.
MAJOR ANDERSON: Go ahead, sir.
KENNY: Last night, we looked like we were going to cut a deal to get us all out of this mess. Today, the Soviets are reneging. We're going to try to salvage the situation, but a lot of things are going wrong today. It's making everyone nervous, and it will be very hard to avoid going to war. Don't get shot down, Major. Beyond that, whatever else you can do to help us, I'd really appreciate it.
MAJOR ANDERSON: When you're up there at 72,000 feet, there's a million things that can go wrong. Is your oxygen mix right? Will your cameras freeze up? Are you leaving Those million things are beyond your control, mostly. But you know, when you realize that, there's a kind of peace. You don't need to be in control. You never were in control in the first place. If you're a good man, and your ground crew are good men, it's all you can ask for. And with the grace of G-d, it'll get you through. The young Major smiles to himself, to the phone.
KENNY: Thank you, Major.
END INTERCUT: EXT. RUNWAY - MACDILL AFB - MOMENTS LATER A cart speeds down the tarmac, an NCO behind the wheel. Beside him sits Major Anderson, his helmet on, visor up. He adjusts the mix on the oxygen bottle he's carrying at his feet, breathing in preparation for the high-altitude flight. Up ahead, among a host of service vehicles, sits the U-2.
MAJOR ANDERSON: This is flight G3132, requesting permission for take-off.
MAJOR ANDERSON: Roger that. And he throws the throttle forward,
THE PRESIDENT: Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
GENERAL TAYLOR: The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
MCCONE: Mr. President, taken with the events of the past few hours, I believe this confirms our worst fears. We're now dealing with a hard-line Soviet government, perhaps with Khruschev as a puppet head, perhaps not. In the silence, Kenny reads the faces around the room. They're convinced by McCone's pronouncement. Kenny's not.
KENNY: It could be a mistake. McCone gives him a get-serious look. But Kenny presses on.
BUNDY: A U-2 on a routine air-sampling mission over Siberia got lost and penetrated Soviet airspace. The Soviets scrambled MIGs in pursuit, thinking it was a bomber. It got out okay. Somebody forgot to cancel the mission.
THE PRESIDENT: Goddammitt. There's always some sonofabitch who doesn't get the word. All we need is the Soviets thinking we're bombing them. Anybody else? The humor falls on a cold audience.
GENERAL TAYLOR: Mr. President, our pilots are in danger. We must order punitive airstrikes against the SAM site that shot down Major Anderson per our rules of And finally the moment Kenny has dreaded all this time has come to pass. He looks at Bobby, then at the President. The President stares at the cup of coffee in his hands, as if trying to read the Fates' design in it. A long beat, and everyone holds their breath.
THE PRESIDENT: No. I want confirmation there wasn't some sort of accident first. LeMay clears his throat. Everyone looks at him, expecting him to scream or jump up and down.
LEMAY: I think that's a good idea, Mr. President. It'll be safer for my boys to get those SAMs on Monday when we get the rest of the bastards. I can wait a day and a half.
THE PRESIDENT: Very well, then. But he says it without any belief in the words, realizing they're being tied fast to the train tracks of war.
KEVIN: Hey! Dad! Kenny manages a smile as Kevin trots over. Kevin pulls his helmet off. They stand there a long beat, Kenny desperate to take him up, abandon his post. but he doesn't.
KENNY: Hey, sport. You winning?
KEVIN: But Kevin sees the turmoil in his father's face.
KENNY: Yeah, Kev. Everything's gonna be fine. But Kevin knows. Together they know. The end of the world is at hand.
KEVIN: I guess you won't be coming home I, uh. Suddenly a car HONKS. Kenny turns around. Bobby is leaning out the rear passenger window of his limo. And he sees what Kenny is doing. He doesn't want to cut in, but has to.
KENNY: I, uh. Suddenly a car HONKS. Kenny turns around. Bobby is leaning out the rear passenger window of his limo. And he sees what Kenny is doing. He doesn't want to cut in, but has to.
BOBBY: Kenny! We need to talk. Kenny looks back at his son.
KENNY: Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
KEVIN: What about you? Where are you going?
KENNY: Back to work. Kevin puts his helmet back on his head. Kenny watches as Kevin jogs off to rejoin his team. Kenny turns his back on his son, and strides for Bobby's limo, dying inside.
KENNY: If we're going to make a deal, we're going to have to do it fast. This is only getting out of control. The only reason we're not at war this very minute is he's been able to stretch, bend and break his own rules. He won't be able to keep it up forever. Bobby jams the last bit of sandwich in his mouth. A beat. Kenny looks him in the eye.
BOBBY: And Jack wants to trade the missiles in The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway
KENNY: And Jack wants to trade the missiles in The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway
BOBBY: The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway
KENNY: Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade? Bobby is speechless with rage.
BOBBY: All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
KENNY: So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
BOBBY: And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution? Kenny stares off at the city, agonized.
RUSK: Whatever response we send, it will take several hours for the wire to be received by our embassy and delivered to the Kremlin. So we're looking at early tomorrow morning at the earliest before Khruschev could respond. As Rusk talks, Kenny passes close by Bobby. Bobby whispers:
BOBBY: He gets it, but he's pissed.
THE PRESIDENT: That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
SORENSEN: It depends on if we really believe there's been a coup. That strikes a cord with Kenny.
KENNY: I agree. If there has been a coup, and there's a hard-line government in power now, then it doesn't matter what we say. The end of the day we'll either agree to their terms, they'll agree to ours, or we'll go to war. But what if there hasn't been a coup? What if. what if what is happening is a series of The second letter is an accident?
SORENSEN: The second letter is an accident?
KENNY: No. The letter is an intentional, but it's having an effect far greater than its authors intended. What if our Jupiter missiles are just a last minute haggle to salvage something? Maybe a bone Khruschev is throwing to the hard line, not really caring if we reject it or not? And then these accidents have happened.
BOBBY: Making the second letter and the overall picture look worse than it really is.
SORENSEN: The Guns of August.
KENNY: ( beat ) If they're sane and human like we are, then maybe we just refuse, and they'll let it slide, like we've been letting things slide.
SORENSEN: So we reject the second letter. And Kenny looks at Bobby. The world stops.
KENNY: No. We don't reject it. It hits Bobby like a lightning bolt.
BOBBY: . We accept the first letter and pretend the second doesn't exist. The President, Rusk and Sorensen stare at him, mute.
MCCONE: It won't work Bobby, Kenny and Sorensen start to object, but McCone raises his voice over theirs.
MCNAMARA: Ignore the second letter, agree to the conditions of the first.
GENERAL TAYLOR: There's no reason to believe the Soviets will let it go.
RUSK: Max is right. Why will they accept it?
MCNAMARA: It can work. If, IF they believe we'll hit them. Kenny, Bobby and Sorensen look at McNamara, grateful.
RUSK: But we have to make them agree to it. So how do we do that? The President leans forward. Sensing he's about to speak, all eyes turn to him.
THE PRESIDENT: We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
KENNY: And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
MCCONE: It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
KENNY: Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
MCNAMARA: At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
KENNY: And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own Most EXCOM is nodding, agreeing. McCone shakes his head in disgust. Taylor sits in silence.
RUSK: Whoever carries the message has to hit the nail on the head. Come across as too soft, they'll push us. Too hard, they'll be cornered and even more They could pre-empt. It's a terrible responsibility to bear. The room is silent. At last Bobby looks up from his folded hands to his brother. The President stares back. There is nobody else who can do this. Only Bobby. His brother.
MCCONE: They could pre-empt. It's a terrible responsibility to bear. The room is silent. At last Bobby looks up from his folded hands to his brother. The President stares back. There is nobody else who can do this. Only Bobby. His brother.
THE PRESIDENT: Bobby. You know Dobrynin best. Bobby nods, taking up the gauntlet.
BOBBY: What do you want? A good-bye kiss? Kenny opens the driver's side door. The Secret Service LIMO DRIVER peers out.
LIMO DRIVER: Hey, Kenny.
KENNY: Hey, Joe. Listen, I'll take care of him. Go ahead in, grab some coffee. We'll be back pretty quick.
LIMO DRIVER: You sure? Kenny's nod and look there's no arguing. The Limo Driver hops out, and Kenny gets in. Bobby stands there outside for a beat. He tries to hide how touched he is, but can't What's the matter with you? Forget how to open a car door?
KENNY: What's the matter with you? Forget how to open a car door?
KENNY: Jesus, you rich people. Kenny starts up the engine. Bobby smiles a twisted smile. As the car pulls away, the two men sit in silence, neither willing to admit how glad the other is there.
BOBBY: I don't know if I can do this. Kenny glances over at him. Bobby stares back.
KENNY: There's nobody else I'd rather have going in there. Bobby looks at him.
BOBBY: Take a left. Kenny looks him. This isn't the way to the Justice Department. But he complies.
KENNY: Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else. And Bobby, in the silence and closeness of the car, turns on Kenny - anguished, knowing his life is at its climax.
BOBBY: You know. I hate being called the brilliant one. The ruthless one. They guy who does the dirty work. The one everybody's afraid of. Kenny looks to him, moved, not knowing what to say.
KENNY: You're right about the smart part, but ruthless, well. That breaks the tension as they arrive at the scene:
RESUME: Kenny gives Bobby a look. Bobby rolls down his window.
BOBBY: Slow down. Smell that?
KENNY: Just wanted to see for myself. They're burning their documents. The final duty of an embassy before war.
BOBBY: Just wanted to see for myself. They're burning their documents. The final duty of an embassy before war.
STAFFER #1: Sir, Ambassador Dobrynin is already here. We have him waiting in your They reach the double oak doors to Bobby's suite and stop. Bobby faces Kenny.
KENNY: I'll whistle up some luck for you. And before Kenny's eyes, all of Bobby's doubt vanishes. In its place, a severe confidence. A grandeur Kenny has never It makes Kenny pause. He beholds his best friend become a man of the ages. And then Bobby SMOOTHLY opens the door.
THE WOMAN: Who are you? Kenny glances to the door. He considers for a long moment.
KENNY: The friend. Kenny breaks the gaze. He begins to whistle again. The CAMERA drifts away, finding the far DOOR to the inner office, Kenny's tune stronger, carrying with it hope.
BOBBY: Ambassador Dobrynin, we are aware that at this moment your missiles in Cuba are at the brink of operational readiness.
BOBBY: My brother, my friends, my countrymen and I cannot and will not permit those missiles to become operational. I promise you that. Dobrynin looks out the window. And then, pained, looks back at Bobby.
DOBRYNIN: Then I fear our two nations will go to war. And I fear where war will lead us. Bobby acknowledges him with a nod.
BOBBY: If the missiles do not become operational, if you remove the missiles, then there will be no war. At this moment, the President is accepting the terms of Secretary Khruschev's letter of Friday night. If the Soviet Union halts construction immediately, removes the missiles, and submits to U.N. inspection, the United States will pledge to never invade Cuba or aid others in that enterprise. Dobrynin stares at Bobby. Stares hard.
DOBRYNIN: If your Jupiter missiles in Turkey were removed also, such an accommodation could be reached. The two men move their argument forward with the deliberation and formality of chess masters.
BOBBY: ( tired sounding ) The United States cannot agree to such terms under threat. Any belief to the ( beat ) was in error. Dobrynin reels internally. The only sign on his face is a slight tremor. Bobby looks up, registers the calculated effect. And to Dobrynin's horror, the Russian believes:
DOBRYNIN: You want war. But not so fast. Bobby folds his hands. And he smoothly goes from hard-ass brinksman to sensitive deal-maker.
BOBBY: However, while there can be no quid pro quo on this issue, the United States can offer a private assurance. Dobrynin holds his breath.
DOBRYNIN: This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
BOBBY: And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
DOBRYNIN: And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
BOBBY: Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy. Meaning this is the bone he can show the hard line. Dobrynin struggles internally, knowing what Bobby has done, wanting to hug him. It comes across as agitation.
DOBRYNIN: Dobrynin rises from his chair. Bobby rises with him.
BOBBY: Dobrynin rises from his chair. Bobby rises with him.
DOBRYNIN: Then you must excuse me and permit me to relay the substance of our discussion to my superiors. Dobrynin heads for the door. Half way there he turns back to Bobby, deeply moved. Deeply grateful.
THE PRESIDENT: We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
BOBBY: He didn't have to worry about nuclear Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
KENNY: All he had was his character. The President and Bobby nod at the justice of that remark.
BOBBY: How does a guy get a rep like that?
THE PRESIDENT: Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is
KENNY: he kept the peace. Kenny looks at the President. The President feels it, and gazes back to him. The three of them stare out at the glittering city. The grandness of the world lies before them, and they are deciding its fate, and are humbled by the awfulness of it. The silence is beyond power. And for a long moment, they know not to disturb it. There is nothing left to say. The President, at last, finishes his You know, we never did control it. Not really. Not like we think. He looks at Kenny. Kenny nods. He knows that now too.
THE PRESIDENT: You know, we never did control it. Not really. Not like we think. He looks at Kenny. Kenny nods. He knows that now too.
HELEN: I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
KENNY: No. I'm glad I'm home. And she knows the worst.
HELEN: How long do we have? Kenny's voice breaks.
KENNY: If the sun rises in the morning, it is only because of men of goodwill. And that's all there is between us and the Devil. They take each other in their arms, the wisdom of the atomic age so simple, so tenuous, every human life hanging by such a thread. yet a thread so powerful. The CAMERA RISES FROM THEM, finding the OPEN WINDOW and the DARKNESS.
KENNY: BOBBY ( O.S. ) Kenny. It's over.
THE PRESIDENT: Hey! Hey. Okay, that's enough. The group quiets down. The Presidents stares at them, calm, firm. They sober up quickly. Kenny listens, expectant.
BUNDY: We've been talking. We can play this big in '64. It's the foreign policy trophy we've been waiting. Kenny sickens. He tries to listen, but it all begins to I think we can ride it all the way home next election. Bet you're way ahead of us, eh? Bundy slaps Kenny on the back. Kenny is pale. Is what they're saying possible? But Bundy and McCone are too wrapped up in their schemes to notice Kenny's distress.
MCCONE: We've ordered crash reassessment of our major geopolitical hotspots. We've got a lot of new clout, and we can run the table on the Soviets. Middle East, Southeast Asia. And Kenny, sad, moved beyond all pity and loathing, realizes it is possible. They haven't gotten it. He is speechless, helplessly shaking his head. Bundy finally sees something isn't right with him.
MCNAMARA: What's wrong, O'Donnell? Kenny can't speak. Can't find the words. But tongue-tied finally manages:
KENNY: Don't you understand? McNamara and Bundy look at him funny.
BUNDY: Understand what? Kenny just looks at them, eyes filled with sorrow. They begin to feel uncomfortable.
KENNY: The sun came up today.
BUNDY: It shouldn't have. But it did.
KENNY: It shouldn't have. But it did.
MCCONE: We were lucky we were able to keep it under control. Kenny looks away, unable to bear it.
KENNY: Every day the sun comes up. says something about us.
BUNDY: Says what, Kenny? Kenny looks back at them.
KENNY: Something. amazing. They just stare at him. And with secret smiles, superior smiles, they nod.
MCNAMARA: Sure, Ken. I understand. Feels good to win, doesn't it? But they don't understand, and together turn away.
BUNDY: See you later, Kenny. Kenny watches them, heads bowed in discussion, disappear into the labyrinth of the West Wing. Kenny turns his back on INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY The President stands at his mirror, tying a bow tie to a tux for some Sunday special event. Kenny gathers up his folder from nearby breakfast table. Kenny meets the President's gaze in the mirror, and the two men know they have been to the same mountaintop.
THE PRESIDENT: A beat. Kenny stands straight, ready for action, ready for some necessary thing. Ready to go back into the game.
KENNY: You know. The President looks at him in the mirror.
FADE OUT: Shortly after the crisis President Kennedy ordered a reassessment of U.S.-Soviet relations, ushering a brief thaw in the Cold War. During this time, the Washington-Moscow hotline was installed to ensure that in a future crisis, miscommunication would not lead to nuclear war. The President was assassinated on November 22nd, a year after the crisis ended.
