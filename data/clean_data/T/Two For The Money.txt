TWO FOR THE MONEY: Written by Dan Gilroy
EXT. HOME MOVIE - 1982 - DAY: A DAD tosses a baseball to his SON.  The boy swings, connects, sends the ball flying.  DAD smiles.
EXT. HOME MOVIE - 1983 - DAY: BRANDON shooting hoops.  DAD drinks a Bud, frowns as he misses.
EXT. HOME MOVIE - 1984 - DAY: BRANDON runs, wears a too-big helmet and pads.  A DOG chases him as DAD throws a football -- long pass -- TIME SLOWS and --
EXT. STADIUM - 1999 - NIGHT: Our eyes adjust to see we're in a STADIUM.  It's a night game. Stands packed.  A PLAY CLOCK fills the SCREEN.  It's the fourth quarter.  Seven seconds left.  Score:  CAL WEST 31 / SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY 27.  A bruised and battered UNLV QUARTERBACK gets a play from the COACH, straps on his helmet as he runs back to the huddle.  The name on the QUARTERBACK'S jersey -- B. LANG. 10 exhausted, desperate faces come close, hang on BRANDON'S every word --
BRANDON VOICEOVER: I'd been a quarterback since pee-wee football.  Set high school records.  Won state championships.  I wasn't driven by joy, it wasn't winning as much as terror, pure and simple -- fear of losing.
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT: BRANDON'S wheeled in.
INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT: SURGEONS regard the leg.  IVs are hooked up.
BRANDON: What's the rehab time? The SURGEONS talk between themselves, impressed by the break.
BRANDON: The patient's got a question! Anesthetic haze.  A wavy world is melting far, far away.
SURGEON VOICEOVER: Football's done, son...
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY: BRANDON'S in a hospital bed.  Big leg cast.  IV's in each arm.
BRANDON'S DAD: I brought some flowers.  From downstairs in the shop.
BRANDON: (pressing the nurse's call button) No, you gotta go -- where's the nurse?
BRANDON'S DAD: I'm thinking of getting into a new program, Brandon. A NURSE comes fast through the door, watches unsure --
BRANDON: Could you get him out, please?
BRANDON'S DAD: It's okay, we're fine, I'm his father.
BRANDON: Just get out! BRANDON tries to rise, IV'S coming loose.  The NURSE takes his DAD'S arm, leads him out to the hall.
EXT. TRACT HOME - DAY: Vegas desert.  It's raining.  A SWNU car pulls up.  The COACH helps BRANDON out, on crutches now.  A middle-aged WOMAN and a TEENAGE BOY stand under a rusty awning, waiting to greet him.
INT. UNLV WEIGHT ROOM - 1997 - DAY: Off-season.  The room's packed.  Loud hip hop plays.  BRANDON limps in on a cane.  Back slaps.  ("B's back!" "The man!")
EXT. SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY TRACK - DAY: Sprinters dart by.  Here comes BRANDON.  Several months have passed.  Big ass brace on his leg.  A GIRL'S TRACK TEAM bounds past like a herd of gazelles.  BRANDON presses on, possessed.
EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY: The TEAM'S practicing for a new season.  BRANDON'S on the sideline, flanked by the COACH and TEAM DOCTOR.
EXT. SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY STADIUM - 1997 - DAY: CROWDED arena.  Electrifying scene.  BRANDON'S suited on the sidelines.  Kick-off.  A SWNU PLAYER returns the ball.
BRANDON: Let's ease back into it with our bread and butter -- TD first play.  We're going deep.  Split right.  Deep two on three! (coming up to the line) Red 38!  Red 28!  Set!  Set-- BRANDON drops back.  Blitz.  Brandon about to throw when one of his own LINEMEN is knocked into him and -- BRANDON'S off balance. Too much pressure on that leg and in one horrible moment... it buckles.  BRANDON falls.  The play whistled dead.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: It made all the highlight films.  People wrote editorials.  Overnight I became the poster boy for the "Dark Side of Sports."
INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY: A PSYCHIATRIST faces BRANDON.  A clock ticks in the corner.
BRANDON: He represented the nearest guy I could grab.
PSYCHIATRIST: ... Let's try again.
INT. WINDOWLESS OFFICE - PRESENT DAY - DAY: CAMERA moves ceiling level above a dreary space.  Passing over cramped cubicles.  Murmer of voices from each one.  EMPLOYEES seen, all reading phone copy into taping devices.  Sex lines, astrology and get-rich-quick schemes are heard.
BOSS: Got a job for you, Lang.
BRANDON: I'm in the middle of taping.
BOSS: Bauer's sick, can't update his betting line.  You know anything 'bout sports?
INT. NEIGHBORING CUBICLE - OFFICE - MINUTE LATER: BRANDON enters a co-worker's cluttered cubicle.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: 900 numbers, audio text, the racket had a lot of names.
INT. BRANDON'S NEW CUBICLE - SEVERAL MONTHS LATER - DAY: A football is seen, rising and falling from BRANDON'S cubicle. He tosses the football as he records a new update --
BRANDON: I want a raise to 12 bucks an hour.
BOSS: I don't make 12 an hour.
BRANDON: You're not picking 75 percent.
BOSS: If you're so good then bet your own games, get rich and send me a postcard
EXT. LAS VEGAS - DAY: BRANDON rides a beat-up bike through downtown.
INT. CASINO - DAY: BRANDON maneuvers through a bustling casino, enters the SPORTS BETTING ROOM.  He goes to a rack of printed bettling lines for the weekend games, pockets a printed sheet, sees a SUPERVISOR.
SUPERVISOR/STU: We're getting big money on Tampa/Oakland.  Everyone's jumping on Tampa Bay.
BRANDON: That game's gonna be won by coaching, Stu.  Gruden put that Tampa Bay team together before he came to Oakland, right?  He knows every weakness of that team and every strength.  He knows Brown only likes to catch over his left shoulder and he'll have him double-teamed to the right.  He knows Gannon always throws on a 3-step drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of the field.  Gannon'll be intercepted at least 4 times on Sunday.
EXT. BRANDON'S HOUSE - NIGHT: BRANDON rides up.  His younger brother, DENNY (18, Metallica t-shirt) and some FRIENDS work on an old, bondo-pocked muscle car in the garage.
INT. BRANDON'S HOUSE - NIGHT: MOM'S readying for work, dressed in croupier attire, searching for something as BRANDON enters.
MOM: Mail came, letter for you, from Chicago. You just tried out last week.  They got back to you quick.  That's a good sign.
MOM: Open it. BRANDON opens it.  Reads.  Words pop out: "Arena Football League"..."We regret to inform you"..."but based on your performance"..."staff declines."
MOM: Shit.
INT. BRANDON'S ROOM - NIGHT: Filled with exercise equipment.  BRANDON pins the letter to a wall covered by dozens of rejections -- National Football League -- Canadian Football League -- Arena Football League. BRANDON changes into shorts.  And now we see, he's in amazing shape. Could maybe still play pro.  But that two foot scar running the length of his leg makes you wonder.  As BRANDON pumps it out we realize he still has a dream of coming back, a dream we sense by his intensity is fast slipping away and --
EXT. LAS VEGAS - DAWN: BRANDON pedals to work when his cell phone rings.  Answering:
MAN'S VOICE: Brandon!
BRANDON: Yeah?
MAN VOICEOVER: Congratulations!  You went 9-2 last Sunday!  20-4 college!  Picking 77 percent winners since opening weekend!  I've been following you!  I'm a big fan, Brandon!  A big fan.
MAN VOICEOVER: This is Walter Abrams.  I don't know if you know me but I run the biggest sports service in the country.  Hell, I started the industry.  Ask around.  Ask anyone,
BRANDON: Do me a favor and lose my number, I gotta go to work. BRANDON hangs up and --
INT. BRANDON'S CUBICLE DAY: BRANDON hefts the bike down the hall, reaches his cubicle to find his phone ringing.  Picking up --
WALTER VO: It's me again.
BRANDON: This is a joke, right?
WALTER VO: A joke can be the ultimate intellectual pursuit sometimes.  This? This is just a job offer.  In your top drawer there's an envelope with your name on it.
WALTER VO: That's travel cash and an airline ticket.  It's not a magic trick, Brandon.  I paid someone to put it there, who incidentally
EXT. JFK MOVING WALKWAY - DAY: BRANDON hefts a duffel bag -- sees an ASIAN DRIVER, chauffeur uniform, mirrored shades, holding a sign reading B. LANG and
INT. MOVING LIMO - DAY: BRANDON eyes a basket of croissants and juice, grabs a danish, takes a bite, sees the DRIVER watching in the mirror.
DRIVER: --Pay me?  Pay Walter.  His car.  I'm Milton, I drive for him.
EXT. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS BROWNSTONE - DAY: Five stories.  Next to the Brooklyn Bridge.  Manhattan rises across the East River.  The limo pulls up.  BRANDON steps out, regards the structure.  Exhaust fans dot the second floor.  Satellite dishes on the roof.  Security cameras everywhere.
INT. BROWNSTONE - TOP FLOOR - DAY: BRANDON follows MILTON through a large, wildly furnished apartment. They pass an large library dominated by rows of bleacher seats from the old Polo Grounds.  A hot dog stand sits outside a wine cellar.  Toys tell us there's a child in the house.  A cha-cha plays from a stereo.  MILTON stops at a set of doors.  About to knock when --
INT. WALTER ABRAMS' OFFICE - DAY: WALTER smokes a cigarette, talking on the phone as an ASSISTANT in a separate, adjoining space handles four ringing phones. Across the room, a large wall is filled with TVS, each turned to a different channel, no sound.
BRANDON: I've been in better.
WALTER: (assessing BRANDON as he speaks--) Modesty's not a virtue, it's a vice, as evil as vanity.  There are rules to
WALTER: If you can sell you'll never starve.  Ever speak in public? Perform?  Anything like that?
WALTER: I know, I'm talking about not in uniform.
BRANDON: I used to sing at church.
WALTER: Oh really?  So you're religious?
BRANDON: I don't know.  I guess.
WALTER: Certain things, you either are or you aren't.  Which is it?
WALTER: C'mon, you won three conference titles at a major university. You think I went to college?  I'm autodidactic.  Big word, huh? Know what it means?  Self-taught.  Partially by reading, sure, but mostly by keeping my eyes open and asking a lot of stupid fucking questions.  I swear to God I'm looking at myself 30 years ago.  A taller, more athletic version maybe, but the resemblance is remarkable.
WALTER: I'm not supposed to smoke any more, among other things.  It's bad for my condition.  So before I die, did you do anything other than the sports phone in Vegas?
BRANDON: How'd you afford that yacht if the picks are free?
WALTER: There is no yacht.  Good, keep asking question.  Next.
BRANDON: You didn't answer about the free picks.
WALTER: I know.  What else?
BRANDON: What's on the second floor?
WALTER: That's where we print the money.  Any more?
BRANDON: No, that clears up pretty much everything.
WALTER: Great.  Welcome aboard.  We got some good stuff to work with.
WALTER: Ever have a manicure?
BRANDON: Me?  No.  Why?
WALTER: Because you need one.  Besides, there's  a girl you gotta meet.
WALTER: Beautiful, you'll like her-- (answering the phone) --This Barnum or Bailey?
INT. HIGH-END, BROOKLYN SALON - DAY: TONI MORROW looks into CAMERA, styles an attractive, 30-ish WOMAN'S hair as the WOMAN regards her face in a mirror --
TONI: Oh yeah, first it's a tune-up, then it's something else, and one day you'll come teetering in with your new 36Cs and a stretched face and you won't be able to say how unhappy you are because of all the collagen they shot in your lips.
TONI: I guess.  Must be the coffee talking. (handing her a fashion magazine) Here, read a fashion magazine.  Feel more insecure about yourself.
BRANDON: Hi.
TONI: I'm Toni.  Walter said you'd stop by.
BRANDON: Nice to meet you. (immediately, re: the pedicure) This was his idea.
TONI: I know.
BRANDON: He makes all his employees do this?
TONI: Every one.
BRANDON: How often?
TONI: Once.  Before they start work.
BRANDON: Weird.
TONI: You think?
BRANDON: I've never had my nails done before.
TONI: I can see that. (putting his hands in water) Strong hands.  Nice.  Do you drink?
BRANDON: No thanks.  I'm fine.
TONI: No, do you drink?
BRANDON: Excuse me?
TONI: Alcohol.  Are you a drinker?
BRANDON: I've been pretty focused on staying in shape.  I mean a beer once in a while.
BRANDON: No. Toni What about gambling?
BRANDON: What about it?
TONI: Look, I'm sorry, I'm pressed for time. (stopping work, regarding him) I asked do you bet.  Are you a bettor?
BRANDON: No.
TONI: Really?  Why not? BRANDON meets her gaze.  Gears turning.  She's hitting on him.
TONI: It's my shop, I better be.  Why don't you gamble?
BRANDON: Well I'll tell you, Toni.  I bet on something once.  Risked everything I had and lost.
BRANDON: I swore I'd never do it again. Toni You're sticking to that story? Brandon Hey, we just met.  I sure wouldn't want to start our relationship off by lying.
TONI: ... He didn't tell you.
BRANDON: What?
TONI: Brandon, Walter and I are married.
BRANDON: What?  Walter just said I was meeting a woman.  He acted like...
BRANDON: How'd I do?
TONI: Except for an illegal forward pass, perfect, flying colors.  Congratulations.  I'm late for my next appointment.
EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY: BROWNSTONE.  CAMERA favors the ground floor windows. WALTER vo The apartment on the first floor is yours.  You have satellite tv, a gym, you want to relax there's a jacuzzi tub the size of a kiddie pool.
INT. BROWNSTONE - FIRST FLOOR - DAY: 900 number office.  A phone and a computer on an empty desk. Two TVs mounted on the wall.  WALTER shows BRANDON around.
WALTER: Your pitch sucks, it doesn't exist.  The pieces are there, we just gotta bust you out.
WALTER: From now on you have a new name -- John Anthony, "The Million Dollar Man."
WALTER: Brandon Lang is still at home with his mother.  You're selling a lifestyle here, and John's livin' large.  John's got a direct line to God and for a measly 25 bucks a call you're gonna let the world's losers listen in.
INT. BROWNSTONE - 900 NUMBER OFFICE - NIGHT: BRANDON studies the copy.  He pops in a CD, hits record, reads into a mike --
EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY: The upstairs window flies open and a CD sails out.
WALTER VO: Wrong!
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - DAY: WALTER turns from the window, faces BRANDON.
WALTER: What's your sales pitch?
BRANDON: What's my sales pitch?  77 percent's my sales pitch.
WALTER: Stats aren't enough!  These are gamblers you're talking to, people ready to risk what they can't afford for what they can't have!  You're selling the world's rarest commodity.
WALTER: Certainty in an uncertain world!
INT. BROWNSTONE - 900 NUMBER OFFICE - NIGHT: BRANDON back at the mike.  Groping for a delivery.
BRANDON: John Anthony here, ready to make all your betting dreams come true!  Call now and let me win for you!  The point spread in the Indiana/Michigan game's up to four, making that game a gimme--
INT. BROWNSTONE - WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY: Another CD sails out.  WALTER staring at BRANDON --
WALTER: What is that shit?  You spent 6 years bouncing from one dead-end job to another.  Riding to work on a frigging bicycle.  Were you making some kind of statement?  What the hell were you afraid of?
INT. BROWNSTONE - DOWNSTAIRS GYM - NIGHT: BRANDON pumping it out.  Music pounds on a stereo.  BRANDON watches himself in the mirror, muscles straining.  He suddenly slams the bar down, goes down the hall, grabs the mike, reads from the copy and --
INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY: BRANDON bounding up to WALTER'S office.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: Game one of my three-team parlay is  Michigan hosting Indiana; the big boys at Michigan are just 2-7 against the spread as a double-digit home favorite and with arch rival Wisconsin on deck next week, Indiana will catch them looking ahead!  Take Indiana plus the 16 points!  It's a lock!
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY: WALTER listening to the CD.  BRANDON watching him.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: You want more?  John Anthony's the man with a plan to make you money!  Game two goes to Florida and North Carolina!  I don't care how many points you gotta lay with Florida, lay it!  They'll win by 50!
BRANDON: C'mon!  First too little, then too much --
WALTER: It's a start.
BRANDON: Tell me what you want.
WALTER: No.  What do you want, Brandon?  That's what this is about!
WALTER: ... Huh?... It's nothing. (popping a pill from the vial, beat, taking another) ... Small one.
BRANDON: Should I call someone?
WALTER: Not unless they got a spare heart.  I'm okay. WALTER finds a cigarette.  Lights it.  Savors the first drag.
WALTER: Courage wants to laugh.
EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MORNING: BRANDON riding his bike hard across the Brooklyn Bridge.   Wearing earphones while he listens to a radio sports show.
INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - DAY: A TV SCREEN FILLS FRAME.  A COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME starts. ANNOUNCERS riff a MEDLEY of analysis and scores.
EXT. BROWNSTONE - SAME TIME - DAY: WALTER catches up to TONI, walks through the party with her.
WALTER: Check him out, you know you want to.
TONI: Get out of your head, Walter.  It's a bad neighborhood. TONI kisses him, walks with WALTER through the party and --
EXT. BROWNSTONE ROOF - DUSK: Satellite dishes aim at the sky.  ANNOUNCER CHATTER continues OVER, giving non-stop COLLEGE football scores.  BRANDON comes down the street, carries a bag of take-out.
EXT. PARK SLOPE - NIGHT: BRANDON rides a bike.  Wears headphones.  Sunday's NFL scores coming in now.  BRANDON'S reactions indicate he's doing well.
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT: WALTER writing on a call sheet -- 375 calls at $25/85 at $50!" The city's seen through WALTER'S office window.  NFL ANNOUNCER CHATTER subsides as scores filter in.  WALTER flipping through BRANDON'S betting sheets, smile spreading over his face and --
INT. N.Y.C. RESTAURANT - NIGHT: Loud.  Crowded.  High-end.  WALTER, TONI and BRANDON at a table, ordering dinner.
WAITER: (takes the menus, departs) Very good, and may I say, sir, an excellent choice.
WALTER: It's bruchetta.  Like little pizzas without the cheese.
BRANDON: Bruchetta.
WALTER: Don't worry about it.  Anyone goes 20 for 24 in college football, 12 for 14 pro can call it whatever he wants.  Ever drink a thousand dollar bottle of wine?  Steward!
WALTER: It's a celebration.  Just because he's out with a couple of reformed drunks doesn't mean he can't enjoy himself.
BRANDON: Actually, truth be told, I've never had a 12 dollar bottle of water either.
BRANDON: No.  I just, this place is great.
TONI: --Watch out, Walter, he's a fixer.
WALTER: 175 calls on the 900 number.
TONI: Did you call home?  Let 'em know how you did?  How you're doing?
WALTER: He's very close.  They sound terrific.
TONI: Is your name Brandon?
BRANDON: Oh, they're great.  We talk all the time.
TONI: What're they like?
BRANDON: Mom's terrific.  Amazing lady.  I got a little brother, Denny, going to college next year.  Complete motor head.  Dad's a... well he's a sports nut.  He was, I mean, it all came from that.
INT. RESTAURANT - LATER: WALTER, TONI and BRANDON finish dessert.
WALTER: I should've ordered two.
TONI: What'd the doctor say, Walter?
WALTER: Oh yeah, I've been meaning to tell you.  I had a check-up yesterday. Afterwards
TONI: Neither should you, Walter.
WALTER: I read chocolate's good for you.
TONI: I'm not raising a kid alone.
WALTER: Don't get dramatic, Toni.  In biblical times you'd just move in with my brother Morty.
BRANDON: Very.
WALTER: Yeah, I can tell.  Don't be.  Ever.  One week's over, another begins.  The past is merely a prologue.  In this job you have to push the envelope every day.
WALTER: Cute doesn't half cover it.  The girl's gorgeous.  And bored out of her mind.  Waiting for some young buck to save her from those two gorillas.  Check it out.  She's eyeing you again, Brandon.
WALTER: I'll bet you 10-to-1 on a 1000 you can't pick her up, cash, if you leave with her.
WALTER: All right.  Before you bust a move, just one thing... (talks across the table, addressing the MODEL and the two MEN)
TONI: What the hell was that?
WALTER: I'll send over a bottle of champagne. Toni You'll pick up their check.
WALTER: The voice of reason.  She's right.  I owe 'em a meal.  Hey -- here we go, Brandon, your girlfriend's going to the bathroom.
WALTER: Hey, I just raised the bar.  C'mon, kid.  John Anthony could close her.
TONI: I'd prefer Brandon... BRANDON smiles.  He walks through the restaurant, up the stairs as the WOMEN'S ROOM door opens and the GIRL emerges before him. She regards BRANDON.  Jaded, disintested air.
GIRL: (stepping past) Excuse me.
BRANDON: I just want to get to know you.
GIRL: You just want to get into my pants.
BRANDON: I want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul.  I don't see you wearing any pants in this equation.
BRANDON: I'm Brandon.  What's your name? GIRl Alex.
BRANDON: Alexandria.  Beautiful name for a beautiful girl. BRANDON leans in close, talking too low now for us to hear. Selling hard.  ALEXANDRIA laughs at something he says and --
INT. MOVING CAB - NIGHT: BRANDON and the GIRL all over each other and --
INT. GIRL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT: 40th floor of a luxury high rise.  In the darkness, BRANDON'S seen naked on a big bed, GIRL straddling him, body rising and falling, pace quickening, back arching.  BRANDON looks up --GIRL silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling windows -- city spires sparkling all around and --
INT. BROWNSTONE BACK STAIRWELL - DAY: WALTER and BRANDON reach the second floor landing, stand outside a solid steel door.
INT. BROWNSTONE SECOND FLOOR - DAY: Another world.  A dozen SALESMEN work in a large room.  Phones ring.  FAXES churn.  Numbers are called out.  A half-dozen GIRLS stroll the space, deliver betting and tip sheets.
HERBIE: Trust me, we're going to turn all this around... I'm aware last weekend was difficult... Well of course I do, that's a substantial sum--
WALTER: Fuck him if he can't take a joke.
BRANDON: You're telling me that all this is legal?
WALTER: It better be.  Five of these guys are off-duty cops.  We're just advising people how to bet, not making the bets for 'em.
REGGIE/INTO PHONE: --It says here your minimum bet's five grand, so let's be honest now, can you
WALTER: Brandon Lang, meet Reggie.
REGGIE: You're the QB that went off on the refs. (BRANDON shamefully nods) --Yeah, but you covered!  Shit, as much money as the refs cost us every year, that was pure.  Totally crystal.  Hell, I like you already.  Even if you did get the best office.
REGGIE: Hamstring.
BRANDON: No, he's in the middle of renegotiating.  It's a tantrum, he'll play Sunday.
INT. OFFICE OVERLOOKING SALES ROOM - SAME TIME - DAY: JERRY SYKES types stats into a computer as he fields a call. Three other computer screens flash football info and data. Large, complex wall graphs chart esoteric team trends.  A framed promotional picture shows JERRY standing in a bank vault, the banner type below reading "Jerry 'The Source' Sykes, Creator of The Sykes Sports Wagering System."
INT. ENCLOSED OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY: WALTER and BRANDON enter.  It's spacious.  Nicely appointed. A glass partition overlooks the sales room.
JERRY: Miami's still a lock.  The win/loss ratios and RPI ratings are off the charts.  I'm keeping it on my sheet.
WALTER: Not you.  John Anthony.
BRANDON: John Anthony doesn't exist.
WALTER: That's a shock 'cause I'm standing in his office and you're sitting in his chair!
WALTER: Big bettors don't want to talk to a middle man, they want to speak to the guy making the picks -- and you're picking 80 percent winners.
WALTER: --Jesus, don't start that shit again.  Sell me.
BRANDON: I don't want your money, I want your bookie's money!
WALTER: What happened to the fuck?
BRANDON: Nothing, I just don't talk like that.
WALTER: I can't have someone working for me who can't say fuck.
BRANDON: It's not that I can't.  Why do I have to?
WALTER: Because there's no other fucking word that can convey the precise feeling and fucking flavor of life's various predicaments and certain concepts the way a well-placed fuck can.  Fuck is your friend.  Fuck can be your best friend.
WALTER: C'mon, repeat after me -- fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.  Fuck he, fuck she, fuck me, fuck them, fuck me -- try it.
WALTER: Backbone.  Almost as good.  We'll keep working on the other thing... So, you really like New York in tonight's game?
EXT. MANHATTAN - MID-DAY: Looking down Fifth.  Thousands of heads in a hurry to get somewhere. Here comes BRANDON and WALTER.
WALTER: Continue your education.
INT. MANHATTAN APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY: A dozen people fill an upscale living room.  Doorbell.  A well dressed WOMAN answers.  WALTER and BRANDON stand before her.
INT. MANHATTAN APARTMENT - DAY: The GROUP sit in a circle, listen as a BUSINESSMAN, near tears, gives his testimony.
MEMBER #1: ... It's a disease, Leon.
MEMBER #2: Admitting you have a problem is the first step.
BUSINESSMAN/LEON: Then I guess I'm doing pretty good because I got one big fucking problem.
WALTER: Not even close.  You're a lemon.  Like a bad car, there's something inherently defective in you.  And you.  And me!  All of us here -- we're lemons!  Big, juicy, acidic, ice-tea flavoring lemons! We look like everyone else but we're defective because when most people make a bet they want to win, while we, the degenerate gamblers of the world, we're subconsciously playing to lose. All humans like going to the edge of the abyss, but what makes us different is we go all the way and hurl ourselves off into the void!  And we like doing it so much we do it time after time after time!  Me?  I always felt most alive when they were raking away the chips, and every one here knows what I'm talking about. People like us, even when we win, it's just a matter of time before we give it all back.  But when we lose, and I mean the kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size of a decimal point, there's a moment when you're standing there and you've just recreated the worst possible nightmare this side of malignant cancer for the 20th goddamn time and you suddenly realize -- hey, I'm still here, I'm still breathing, I'm still alive!  In order to really live you have to be aware of your own mortality -- and a losing bet of a certain size is one of the best ways
WALTER: Check the charter, buddy, we all left our jobs at the door. You gonna toss an ex-alcoholic bartender out of an AA meeting?
BRANDON: ... No, I mean, we walked in together --
WALTER: (handing out business cards) -- My card -- we're topping 80 percent this season -- put it in your wallet, in case you fall off the wagon --
INT. APARTMENT ELEVATOR - DAY: WALTER and BRANDON riding down in silence.  Finally --
BRANDON: What the fuck was that?!
WALTER: ... What'd you just say?
BRANDON: You heard me!  I said what was that?
WALTER: No, you said "What the fuck?"  That's what you said.
BRANDON: So?
WALTER: That was great!  It was all worth it! Don't you see?  I felt your anger because of that one word!  Well done!  I'm proud of you!  The progress you're making Brandon, I gotta say, it's exhilerating!
INT. SALESROOM - DAY: Cacophony of calls.  Building buzz.  College football games play in the BG.  The big, bearded MAN  exits his pack-rat cluttered work space, strides to the office coffee machine, pours a quick cup.  BRANDON approaches, extends a hand.
BIG MAN: (averting his gaze, walking past) Congratulations.
BRANDON: I'm picking now with you and Jerry.
CHUCK: (ducking back into his office) Whatever. The MAN shuts the door, leaves BRANDON looking at the KEEP OUT sign.  SOUTHIE stops for a coffee, has seen the exchange.
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY: BRANDON'S poring over sports pages and injury reports when TAMMY enters his office, sits on his desk, extends a lead sheet.
TAMMY: Walter wanted your first call to be special.  Go get 'em tiger.
INT. NEW JERSEY DRY CLEANER - DAY: A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN (ratty t-shirt, beard stubble, sleepless look) stands in the back of a low-end dry cleaners.
BRANDON: Today's your day, Amir!  It's a Pamplona thing, I'm running wild in the streets this weekend!  Starting with the hottest Saturday of my life!  How much can you lay with your bookie?  20 large?
BRANDON: (looks up, sees WALTER watching) Oklahoma huh?  Okay... well considering that, I like Texas even more now.
BRANDON: --Amir, buddy, I'm talking about banging out the biggest win of your life.
BRANDON: Hold on, I got Vegas on the line. (pressing HOLD)
WALTER: There's only one thing you have to know about any of our clients -- they're all in the hole.  The second they pick up the phone, wham!  Right to the point!  You're above them!  Let 'em feel it!  More confidence!  More John Anthony!
AMIR: Favorite drink?  I dunno, Pina Colada.
BRANDON: Tomorrow we gotta get you a new drink.  But for now, this is what you're gonna do.  First, you're going to bet 20 large on Texas, then you're going to put on a
BRANDON: Good question.  What about it? Amir Well how much is this going to cost me?
BRANDON: We take a percentage if WE win, Amir -- not exactly your problem of late, is it?

BRANDON: What's all the commotion?
TONI: The doctor, thank God, put Walter,on an exercise program.  I want to be there the first time he goes.  Make sure the trainer understands Walter's aversion to consistency.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT: WALTER, TONI and BRANDON relaxing after dinner.

BRANDON: It sounds like a promotion.
WALTER: Bet your ass it is.  Five-star.
BRANDON: --I'm in.
TONI: Well that's a thoughtful response.  Here I was, worried you'd rush your decision.

WALTER: Perfect, then you're a lock to win.
INT. TV PRODUCTION HOUSE - NIGHT: The CAMERA TRACKS to a talk show-like set dominated by a triangular table, three chairs and a backdrop bearing a sports-themed logo and the words - THE SPORTS ADVISORS.

WALTER: (fumbling with a clipped on mike) Something's wrong here.
JERRY: (leaning over, plugging in a wire) Your lead's loose, I got it.  I'm talking to the tech guys about going wireless.
TECH: Five, four, three, two, one-- (NOTE: WALTER and the PANEL follow text from a teleprompter.)
BRANDON: Not in my case.  You tell us, Jerry.
JERRY: It sets you free?

INT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT: WALTER walks down the dim hall, looks in on JULIA, sleeping.
INT. WALTER AND TONI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT: Dim darkness.  Silence.  Then someone bumps into something. Muffled curse.  A light goes on.  TONI sits up in bed, sees WALTER fully dressed, across the room, holding his shoes.
TONI: It's four in the morning.
WALTER: (continues to his dresser, manic) What a show!  You should have seen him!  I'm sitting there watching him roll and I swear he made me want to grab a phone and call! I took the sales boys out to Smith and Wo's.  Get 'em primed for the
TONI: What are you doing?
WALTER: Going for a run.  See the sunrise.  We're doubling volume this week.  And doubling it again after that.  He can pick, he can sell, he's gonna change things around here.  He's the real deal. Knows sports from the inside.  That's how he picks.  Guy like him comes along once in a -- a --

TONI: Walter, come to bed.
WALTER: Not tired.
TONI: You're exhausted.
WALTER: I'm just gonna run the bridge, up Fifth, circle Central Park, be back in no time.

INT. SALES ROOM - DAY: A SLEDGE HAMMER smashes through a wall.  DELIVERYMEN dolly in new desks and chairs to accomodate more salesmen.  SOUTHIE and REGGIE at the water fountain, watch the room expand.
WALTER: What a weekened!  Helluva Christmas bonus if this keeps up. Where'd you hide the phone sheet?
TAMMY: I dunno, he said it was personal.
WALTER: Did Brandon take the call? Tammy He wasn't in.
WALTER: Don't mention it to him.  And don't patch the guy through.  Say Brandon doesn't work here, you can't reach him.
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY: BRANDON at his desk, reading The New York Post.  JERRY enters.
JERRY: I'm underwater here, man.  Yes or no?
BRANDON: No.
JERRY: You know something... You hear anything, let me know.  That's how this works.
JERRY: All inside information gets shared.
BRANDON: Inside?  I've got nothing inside.
JERRY: F.Y.I. -- we work as a team here, that's the way we do it.  I'll do the same for you.  So stop holding out on me, babe.
JERRY: Listen you little shit, I've been doing this six years to your one.
WALTER: For some people. (to BRANDON)
WALTER: There's a 50-dime bettor on line three.  Wants to talk to John Anthony.
WALTER: His name's Carl.  Carl owns a couple dozen McDonalds franchises. Guy's a gazillionaire.  That sign out front might as well be his bank account.
JERRY: He's raiding my fucking lists!
WALTER: Your clients are jumping ship you lactose intolerant fuck!  Get outta my sight!
BRANDON: Carl, John Anthony here, how's the fast-food king...?  Good--
INT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT: The door opens.  TONI, carrying groceries, and JULIA, dressed in ballerina clothes enter, walk into the kitchen.
TONI: Okay, let me just put the groceries away.
JULIA: I want to play princess.
TONI: So do I.  Go put your dress on. JULIA runs off to her room when TONI suddenly spies a tacky, woman's jacket draped on a chair.  TONI regards it and --
GIRL: Thanks, Walter.  Talk to ya.
WALTER: (seeing TONI) I can explain. The CALL GIRL slides by, shows herself out.  TONI staring.
WALTER: No, no, you think she was for me?  Are you crazy?  No.  I just had her come up to pay her.  I got her for John.
WALTER: You think I slept with her?  C'mon!
TONI: Who the hell's John?
WALTER: Brandon, we all call him John now.
TONI: You got Brandon a hooker?
WALTER: New city, no friends, working all hours.
TONI: What the hell are you creating here, Walter?
WALTER: I don't understand this.  I was helping him out, that's all.
WALTER: This kid's different, he's different -- wait a minute.  This has nothing to do with you, you know I do business up here. Why are you so angry?
TONI: Of what?!
WALTER: Gee, I don't know -- Brandon screwing someone?
TONI: You really are fucking crazy, Walter!  That never entered my mind!
TONI: Fuck you! TONI goes into the kitchen, slams the door.  Calling to her --
JULIA: Can we play princess, Daddy?
WALTER: Course we can.  Who am I gonna be?
JULIA: You're the king, daddy, like always.
INT. SPORTS ADVISORS TV SET - NIGHT: BRANDON practicing John Anthony expressions.  A pretty MAKE-UP ARTIST finishes touching him up.

WALTER: John's up first tonight, Jerry.
JERRY: What?
WALTER: John Anthony's leading off tonight.
JERRY: John Anthony's leading?
WALTER: Somebody tell the engineer there's an echo in here.
JERRY: Two years I lead and you bury me in the deck over a few lousy fucking weekends?  The Sykes System's based on percentages -- the long haul.
JERRY: (to CHUCK) You gonna sit for this shit? CHUCK shrugs, finishes his muffin.  JERRY turns to WALTER --
WALTER: He's leading. JERRY unclips his microphone, stands.
WALTER: That's baby talk!  You need a fucking rattle!  Sit down! (staring him down) You probably think you know what I'm gonna say... how everything you got I pay for.  Your apartment, your car, your kid's school -- and it's true.  You'd be right.  I do.  Now I don't know, Jerry, maybe you break your losing streak, end the shneid, start winning again and find yourself another job, but then of course maybe you don't.  I don't see you taking that chance.  My gut says you'll walk out of here on principle or even pride but not on a gamble, a hunch yet.  And if you do, fuck it.  I give a shit?  The only reason I keep you around is it makes me look loyal and him--
WALTER: Welcome to week 7 of pro football!

BRANDON: Have you been blocking any of my calls?
WALTER: Of course.  You don't need distractions, there's a lot of crazies out there.

EXT. TV PRODUCTION HOUSE BUILDING - NIGHT: WALTER and TONI trail BRANDON down the lamp-lit sidewalk.
WALTER: Hold on, Brandon, if I didn't block his calls would you've talked to him?  Honestly.
WALTER: Then what exactly is the point, Brandon? What's the full story here?  What's the deal with your old man?
WALTER: --I only know pieces.  I was trying to spare you from something.
WALTER: "Great?"  Tell him about the uncle--
TONI: --He gets the idea.
WALTER: Don't sugarcoat this shit, you were abused by everybody but the family pet, isn't that right, honey?
WALTER: (to BRANDON) Your father was a drunk, a jerk -- so what?  It happens.  I'm glad I blew him off.  Know why?  Because what you need is a new image of a man.  How 'bout me?
WALTER: If not me, then pick someone else.  It's all in your head!  The shit that happened to you, to Toni, to me -- you know what it is?  Just that, shit that happened.
WALTER: Dad!  Is that you?
MAN: I'll crush you like a beetle!
WALTER: How's Mom?!
MAN: Fucking freak!
WALTER: I love you too!  Don't wait up! WALTER, TONI and BRANDON all laugh.  The three of them doubled over on the dark, deserted street.  MAN screaming from above. The ring of a phone begins bleeding in and --
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY: New furniture and sports photos on the walls suggest the passage of time.  BRANDON stands before a mirror, being fitted for a suit by a TAILOR.  He has a cigar in one hand, Coke in the other, talks into a headset as he watches the TAILOR work.

BRANDON'S MOTHER: Brandon, is that you?
BRANDON VOICEOVER: That's me.
INTERCUT: Are you okay?
BRANDON: Never better.  Kicking ass and taking names.  Did you get the money I sent?
BRANDON: Good good good.  I talked to Denny.  Next month I'm flying you and him out here.  First class.  I'll put you up at The Plaza. You'll love this joint.
BRANDON: It's just how people talk here. (looking down at the TAILOR, edge) How many times I gotta say no cuff?
BRANDON'S MOTHER: Who's this John Anthony person?
BRANDON: He's me.  I'm him.
BRANDON'S MOTHER: And he talks like that?
BRANDON: He's pretty fucking salty -- geez, I'm sorry, Mom -- I mean yeah. Look, the main point is I'm learning a lot here.
BRANDON: I appreciate the concern, Ma, but the checks I've been sending -- the checks you've been cashing -- those are from John Anthony.
WALTER: We're going to Puerto Rico!
BRANDON: Gotta put you on hold, Ma. (pressing a button on the headset) What's in Puerto Rico?
WALTER: Since Ricky Martin moved out, all that's left are tourists, cruise ships and C.M. Novian -- one of the biggest sports bettors in the world.  He just called.  Wants to meet you in person!  To-day! Flight leaves Laguardia in 45 minutes.
EXT. SAN JUAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT: An AIRLINER roars in for landing.
INT. AIRLINE TERMINAL - NIGHT: WALTER and BRANDON pass through FRAME.
BRANDON: What do you know about him?
WALTER: Not much, 'cept for the fact he's a world class prick.  Bastard treated me worse than my Hong Kong tailor.  Never once returned a call.  I've been trying to bag this guy for years.  Do you have any idea what this is worth?
WALTER: Look at me.  There is no if -- it's only when.  This time he called us, remember?  You hooked him.  Know that.  Sweat that.
WALTER: Brandon --
BRANDON: Save your strength.  Help's coming.  Help's coming.
WALTER: ... Do you love me?
BRANDON: Of course I do.
WALTER: Uh-huh.
BRANDON: I do.  I really do love you.
WALTER: ... How much?
BRANDON: A lot!  Now don't talk. (turning to the CROWD) We need a doctor! Several stunned ONLOOKERS run for help.  WALTER fading fast.
WALTER: ... Would you love me if this was a joke?
BRANDON: What?
WALTER: I'm fine.  Just practicing... WALTER smiles.  Stands.  Brushes himself off.  To the CROWD --
BRANDON: You sick fucking fuck!  That was too goddamn fucking far!!!
INT. PUERTO RICAN MANSION - DAY: Palatial.  Drapes dance before the open doors.  Music plays. BRANDON and WALTER sit in the living room.  Peaceful beat.
BRANDON: Nice round number, is that our ceiling here?  Is that the most we're working with?
NOVIAN: I own it.
BRANDON: Well, sir, that's how I feel about this weekend.  That may sound cocky, I don't care.  I didn't come down here to lie.
BRANDON: If I did I wouldn't share that with you.  My record speaks for itself.  The truth is I know these teams better than they know themselves.  I'm going 12 for 12 this weekend, and that includes the Monday Night parlay.
BRANDON: With all due respect, Mr. Novian, you can't afford not to.
NOVIAN: I can afford to do any damn thing I please.
BRANDON: Can you?  What I'm saying is can you -- can anyone for that matter -- afford to lose as much as a man like you probably needs to bet to feel a win?  Winning's a funny thing, Mr. Novian... it's one of those rare commodities on earth money can't buy.  Or was, until you called me.
BRANDON: The price is a quarter million, Mr. Novian -- up-front -- in addition to a percentage of every game you win.
BRANDON: And we've never charged it before.  But with what you're betting, 250 up front's a bargain.  You want this weekend's winners, that's my offer.  Take it or leave it.
EXT. NOVIAN'S BALCONY - DAY: NOVIAN and BRANDON regard a group of GIRLS lounging topless by a pool.
BRANDON: Nope.
NOVIAN: I have, in fact it's how I started. Builds character.  See those girls down there?  Pretend they're oranges and pick some ripe ones.  Take 'em upstairs and build some character.  Mr. Abrams and I need to refine the terms.
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY: A FOOTBALL BETTING FORM fills FRAME.  Two columns of teams seen. Point spreads penciled in between them.  11 of 12 games checked off.  Monday Night the last to be decided.
YOUNG SALESMAN: Shelia.
BRANDON: What street did you grow up on?
YOUNG SALESMAN: Atlantic Avenue.
BRANDON: Who do you like Monday night?
YOUNG SALESMAN: I don't know.
BRANDON: Pick one.
YOUNG SALESMAN: That's your job.
BRANDON: I'll do your job tomorrow, today you do mine.
YOUNG SALESMAN: What are you talking about?
BRANDON: Pick one.  Stop stalling.  You know who's playing.  Seattle versus New Orleans.
YOUNG SALESMAN: You can't do that.
BRANDON: Sure I can!  Over 34 points or under!
YOUNG SALESMAN: Over! BRANDON checks it off, gives him the finished form.
YOUNG SALESMAN: I'm not handing that in.  Like a million dollars is going on that game!
BRANDON: Didn't they tell you?  There is no if.
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT: MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.  Final seconds of a hard-fought game. The Seattle QUARTERBACK'S driving, completes a long pass to a RECEIVER who's brought down at the New Orleans 10-yard line.
REGGIE: Who fucking cares?  He's money. JERRY SYKES stands nearby, listening.  Whoops of excitement as WALTER jumps up on his desk, starts throwing cash.  JERRY moves through the raucous CROWD, finds BRANDON against a wall, out of the fray, watching WALTER hurl money in the air.
WALTER: Here, get you teeth fixed.  There might be some other businesses you can make two mill in one weekend, but tell me, someone please tell me -- where else are you gonna have this much fun?
WALTER: A one with five zeros behind it.
BRANDON: ...A 100 fucking thou?  On two million?
WALTER: You're working out of my shop.
BRANDON: I was thinking of ten percent.
WALTER: Really?  Is that what you were thinking?
BRANDON: I got you Novian.
WALTER: Nice job, now don't blow it by getting ahead of yourself.  I'm looking beyond the money.
BRANDON: I'm winning... I'm winning... BRANDON leaves.  WALTER pulls her close, moves with the music.
TONI: ... Are you gambling again, Walter?
WALTER: What?  Oh, c'mon -- hell no.
TONI: Look me in the eye and say it.
WALTER: I am not gambling.  Not now, not ever.  18 years clean.  That shit's over.
WALTER: Get a lie detector if you don't believe me.  Shoot me with truth serum.  Baby -- we just made two-million dollars.  I'm working miracles here.  Now can I enjoy a dance with my wife?  Huh? I swear, it's a shame you can't drink, we need something to kill that bug up your ass.
EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT: BRANDON'S Mercedes speeds into the city.
INT. MANHATTAN STRIP CLUB - NIGHT: Big breasts, G-strings, testosterone.  BRANDON in a booth with a topless BLACK GIRL.  We can see from his moves it's the Million Dollar Man talking.  Drinking Dom.  Flashing cash.  He whispers something to her.  She reaches for her top as he grabs the hand of her topless FRIEND and --
INT. STRIP CLUB - PRIVATE BACK ROOM - NIGHT: DARKNESS.  A light goes on, illuminates a cave-like bedroom. MUSIC from the club rumbles through the space, reduced to a driving bass beat.  The ASIAN GIRL pulls an outrageous wad of cash from BRANDON'S pocket, tosses it confetti-like in the air as -- BRANDON, the ASIAN GIRL and the BLACK GIRL fall on the gold lame sheets.  Clothes are peeled off, money sticking to their bodies, GIRLS clawing the cash from BRANDON'S skin --
BRANDON: It's just like sex.  You start by massaging the numbers, very relaxed,
INT. BROWNSTONE SALESROOM - DAY: 25 SALESMEN stand on their desks, clapping, as BRANDON passes through on the way to his office.  Only it's John Anthony who's strutting through the room, high-fiving SALESMEN, kissing the GIRLS, a tanned, tailored, magnetic presence and --
INT. BROWNSTONE - BRANDON'S OFFICE - MORNING: WALTER waits within, standing at the window overlooking the sales room as BRANDON enters.
BRANDON: (glance at his watch) Yeah, it's--
WALTER: --Wrong.  It's time to press, my friend.  We're yanking out all the stops.  When you're winning -- you press.
WALTER: What are you doing?
BRANDON: I have a 10:30 tee time at Wingfoot with a client, that Howell guy.  Don't call me unless the lines change.
WALTER: Stop screwing around, you got a lot to do before this weekend.
WALTER: Whoa -- hold on -- slow down -- today's only Tuesday, you have all week.
WALTER: Hey -- we're gonna be advising somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million dollars this week.
WALTER: You're really gonna make your picks now?  No study?  No analysis? Just like that?
WALTER: Then the next day! But BRANDON'S gone.  WALTER considers what's just occured, regards the finished betting form.  He dons his glasses and begin examining BRANDON'S picks and --
EXT. OUTSIDE THE BROWNSTONE - DAY: BRANDON loads his golf clubs in the Mercedes, spies TONI coming down the front steps.
TONI: Some of us have to work.
BRANDON: Come on, get in.  I'll give you a lift. ANGLE ON -- upper brownstone window.  WALTER looks down.  Watches TONI'S legs swing into BRANDON'S sports car and --
INT. MOVING MERCEDES - DAY: BRANDON speeds fast down a street.  Uncomfortable beat.
BRANDON: Some ride, huh?  Feel that?  Feel that?
TONI: Slow down, Brandon.
BRANDON: Why?  This car was made to go fast.
TONI: Not with me in it.
BRANDON: C'mon, Toni, loosen up. (goosing the gas, laughing) Let me ask you something.  When you're not at the shop, or running Julia to play dates or keeping Walter from losing his mind, which I know is a full-time job,
TONI: I stay busy.
BRANDON: That's not what I asked.
TONI: Yes it is.
BRANDON: What do you do for you, Toni, for yourself.
TONI: "What do I do for myself?"  If you drove past my salon and went two blocks down Prospect Street you would have found me 20 years ago with a needle in my arm.  I was a 5-bag a day junkie.  I would have sold Julia to get high.  Keeping it all on track, that's what I do for myself.
0.: BRANDON pulls up outside her shop.  TONI regards him.
TONI: Yeah, that's living.
BRANDON: Hell yeah.  You oughta try it some time.
TONI: (stepping from the car) Thanks for the ride, John... TONI enters her shop and --
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY: Eight football games are winding down, another four starting. Favor one of the TV SCREENS.  A network sports update.  CHRIS BERMAN motor-mouthing a one-minute list of results.
WALTER: Sit down!  You're watching every game!  Every second of every minute of every game!  Don't even think of leaving!
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT: All but one tv is dark.  The last game ends and a remote control suddenly shatters the screen.  WALTER paces the office.  BRANDON still on the sofa.  No one else in the room.  A wall clock reads 12:19 AM.  WALTER picks up BRANDON'S betting sheet, holds it like a dead fish.
WALTER: Fuck Monday night!  Fuck the parlay! You were pissed at me, right?  The commission thing?
BRANDON: I don't know.
WALTER: You fucked with me, right?  Joke's on me, right?  The money thing. Okay, I think we're on dangerous ground here but I'm giving you a bump, 10 percent.  Now what about Monday night's game? You want to look over that pick?  Because everyone's gonna double down to climb out of the fucking hole you put 'em in.
WALTER: You'd bet your mother's house on it?
BRANDON: I don't bet.
WALTER: If you did?
BRANDON: I like the pick, Walter.
WALTER: On your mother's house or not?
BRANDON: With my mother in it.
INT. UPPER EAST SIDE BAR - NIGHT: Up-scale.  BRANDON sits at the end of the rail, empty glasses lined before him, watching a wall TV with the sound off.  Monday Night Football's on.  His glazed expression suggests it's been a long three hours.  PATRONS around him socialize, laugh, enjoy the bar's oasis-like vibe.  But for BRANDON, it's just him and the game as -- a GIRL approaches, big smile.
FUCK!: HEATHER taken aback, pulls away.
BRANDON: Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!!! HEATHER quickly leaves.  Other PATRONS react.  BRANDON in his own world of pain.  BARTENDER eyeing him now.  BRANDON throws down the rest of his drink, trying to steady himself.  His beeper suddenly sounds.  He looks and --
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY: BRANDON'S a man absorbed.  The office is filled with sports pages from every newspaper in the country.  Injury reports.  Power ratings.  BRANDON studying everything and --
EXT. CHELSEA PIERS - MANHATTAN - NIGHT: Similar lights illuminate a driving range on the Hudson River.
EXT. DRIVING RANGE -- TOP TIER - NIGHT: BRANDON smacks one to the 250 sign, about to hit another and
--: Helluva swing.  Great game.  Sport of kings, right?  Or is that horse racing?
WALTER: Southie told me where you were.
BRANDON: I had to get out.  Clear my head. (teeing one up) Well talk to me.  How'd we do?
WALTER: You haven't seen the scores?
BRANDON: Nope.  That's how I wanted it.  Just make the picks and get the results later.
BRANDON: I think we kicked ass.
WALTER: It was amazing.
BRANDON: I told you.  Last week was nothing. BRANDON smacks a drive, watches it soar --
WALTER: You're right, nothing compared to how much we lost today!
BRANDON: ... What'd I go?
WALTER: I have an idea.  I give you a few glimpses of what happened here today and you take a stab.
WALTER: You don't like that game.  Too bad.  Woulda been fun.  Grown men crying on the phone.  Wives screaming in the background. Three salespeople quit 'cause they couldn't take the pressure!
WALTER: No.  When you lose 10 out of 12, fuck doesn't quite cover it. What would be more appropriate is something like "Holy Fucking Shit!" Or "My Fucking God."  Or "Jesus Fucking Christ!"
WALTER: You're right.  I mean 2 for 12 on our biggest volume weekend -- what the hell's left to say?  Except maybe keep the phone number and switch it over to a fucking suicide hotline!
OMIT: Omit Omit
EXT. BROOKLYN PARK - EARLY MORNING: Gloomy fog.  A few PEOPLE heading home from work.  BRANDON riding his bike, pedaling fast when a MAN suddenly steps out, flash of something in his hand, jamming it in the spokes and --BRANDON wipes out, over the handlebars -- hard to the ground --
BODYGUARD: Mr. Novian wants to see you.  Now.
BRANDON: (seeing a gun in his waistband) ... Tell him to call.
BODYGUARD: You tell him. BRANDON looks, sees NOVIAN nearby.
NOVIAN: I didn't recognize you without the suit, John.
BRANDON: This is my time off.  It's how I clear my head.  You want to talk, pick a time.
BRANDON: I'm leaving. The BODYGUARD grabs his arm.  Iron grip.
NOVIAN: Feel that?  I hate the cold.  Winter's coming.  Water's getting rough.
BRANDON: You flew to New York for--
NOVIAN: --That's right.
BRANDON: ... I'm sorry.
NOVIAN: I don't accept it.  Not good enough.  Try again.
BRANDON: I don't know what you want me to say.  I'm sorry.  I am.  I'm very sorry.
BRANDON: I am very, very sorry.  That's a lot of money.
NOVIAN: Not even close.
BRANDON: I'm sorry!
NOVIAN: This isn't going to work.  I'll have to get satisfaction somehow else.
INT. STUDIO PRODUCTION SET - NIGHT: WALTER, BRANDON, JERRY and CHUCK at the desk, waiting for the weekly taping to start.  WALTER jots notes.  JERRY leans over.
JERRY: Listen, I think I should lead off.  I have some really strong stuff.
JERRY: C'mon, I went 8 for 12 last weekend.  I'm hot.  I'm feeling it.
TECHNICIAN: 60 seconds.
JERRY: What am I, wood?
WALTER: You got one good weekend under your belt, don't push it.
JERRY: One weekend?  The Sykes System revolutionized this industry.
WALTER: Take a hike.
JERRY: What?
WALTER: You heard me.  You're fired.  Goodbye.
JERRY: I'm not fired, you need me more than ever.
WALTER: Beat it, you cut-rate parasite!
JERRY: In six years my worst weekend was never as bad as any of his last three weeks!
JERRY: What the hell are you doing, Walter?    C'mon, man -- it's me, Jerry.  These other guys come and go.
WALTER: I am!  You couldn't pick your fucking nose without a computer! You're small!  You belong in a can!  Show some self-respect! It's over, Jerry -- leave!
INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT: A BUDWEISER COMMERCIAL fills FRAME -- PULL BACK TO SHOW -- BRANDON in bed, under the covers, peeking at the tv over a remote.  The sports wrap-up comes on, scores flashing on the screen.  No clue how he did until his phone rings. Then his cell vibrates.  BRANDON gets out of bed.  Fully dressed. Buries the phone under the mattress.  He turns off the cell, but within seconds it starts vibrating again.  BRANDON sinks into a corner.  Knock at the door.  BRANDON doesn't move.  Another knock and --
TONI: It's me, Brandon.  Can I come in?
BRANDON: No.  It's not a good time.  What do you need?
TONI: I need to talk to you, it's important. BRANDON lost, doesn't answer.
TONI: You need to get out, Brandon.  You need to go.
BRANDON: I gotta pick a winner is what I gotta do.  I gotta get back on track.
TONI: Please, Brandon.
BRANDON: I'll figure it out... TONI leans her head against the door, exasperated, spent and--
EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - MANHATTAN - NIGHT: BRANDON, suit and tie, stands in the lobby of an apartment high-rise, speaks on a house phone.  An unsmiling DOORMAN watches nearby.
INT. LUXURY HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - NIGHT: The DOORMAN stands at the entrance, watches BRANDON wait.  ALEX appears, beautiful as the night BRANDON picked her up in the restaurant.  Her demeanor, however, is far from friendly as she exits the elevator.
ALEX: What are you doing here?
BRANDON: I came by to take you out for a late dinner and a couple of killer bottles of wine.  C'mon.  We'll go back to that place where we met.
ALEX: Let me make this real clear so this shit doesn't happen again. You mean nothing to me.  Oh wait, I take that back -- you meant 5000 bucks.  Your friend set it up.
EXT. MANHATTAN - DAWN: Pale sunrise over the East River.
INT. SALES ROOM - DAWN: BRANDON, suit and tie, walks through the silent, empty room.
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAWN: BRANDON sits at his desk.  Staring out at the city.  His phone rings.  Again.  Again.  Finally pressing speaker phone --
BRANDON: Amir? Amir My business... My house... My credit...
BRANDON: No, now listen to me -- we got a big weekend coming up, buddy
--: Still you talk like this.  Who the fuck are you, like this is some kind of game.  I was betting a few thousand a Sunday when I called you.  You pushed me.  Every call.  All the time with your talk... I lost $380,000 this weekend... I was going to get married... I had a life...
INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING: BRANDON paces the dim space.  Sits on the bench press.  Leans back on the board.  He stares up at the weights.  Moves the weight pin to 250... and slowly starts to lift.  One rep.  Two.  Three. Four.  A bad of sweat forms.  BRANDON throws off the jacket. Pulls off the tie.  Removes his shirt and shoes.  He resumes lifting, grim determination -- the weights rising over and over and over -- faster and faster and --
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MORNING: BRANDON, t-shirt and sweats, approaches WALTER'S office, bursts through the door --
WALTER: No!  C'mon in.  We're done here.  Right fellas?  All through? You want a bite before you go?  Something to drink?
BRANDON: Who were they?
WALTER: We need a bat light or something, you know a signal I can shoot up at the
WALTER: They're from the Salvation Army.  How the hell does someone go 1-for-8?  A fucking monkey tossing darts could do better!
WALTER: 1-for-fucking-8! (coming around the desk) I have a plan.  From now on we take your picks and reverse everything! Like a Twilight Zone episode where everything's the opposite! You say black we go white!  A is B!  Lose becomes win!
WALTER: (sweeping the pile to the floor) How much is what?  Oh, that -- 275,000 dollars!
BRANDON: What happened to the two mill, all the other money?
WALTER: I was carrying twice that in red ink before you showed up.  The last few weeks I thought keep the pressure off.  He'll come around. Climb out on his own.  Now I figure fuck it!  Time to turn on the lights!  Let him see the toilet he's drowning us all in! Maybe that'll shake him up!  So what do you want to know?  I got three mortgages on this house, I'm gambling again and to cover my losses I just got a loan from a guy who works out of a bar on a 106th and Broadway!  All this -- everything you see around you --
WALTER: You went 82 and 11!  You were picking 80 percent -- how could I fucking not!?  Trouble is I bet heavy after you went a hundred percent and rode you right into the fucking toilet!  One decent weekend and I would have been set for life!  One decent weekend!
WALTER: "I know what the problem is!"  That's it!  You came in with a big smile and said, "I know what the problem is!"
BRANDON: No thanks.  I'll stay here.  Eat light.
WALTER: (kneeling down, stacking the cash) The Brandon thing!  What am I thinking trying to get you to go out?  What would Brandon eat for lunch?  Peanut butter and jelly? Ramen noodles?  What?
WALTER: You want anything shipped from home?  Your bed?  Clothes?  Porno collection?
WALTER: Blow job?
BRANDON: Thanks anyway.  Maybe later...
WALTER: Because it's important.
BRANDON: Pressure doesn't help.
WALTER: God forgive me, you're an artist.  I fucked with that.  Two little winners and a couple of over/unders.  That's all we need.  You could phone it in.  Two's nothing.  Not for you.  Not for Brandon. Right, Brandon?  Isn't that right?
BRANDON: That's who I like.
WALTER: Brandon made these picks?
BRANDON: You're looking at him.
WALTER: (regarding the picks, to the room) New York and the under, Tenessee and the under!  Sell 'em hard!
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY: SALES STAFF crowd into the room.  WALTER and BRANDON sit side-by-side. Seconds before kickoff of the New York/Atlanta game.  JULIA climbs into WALTER'S lap, holding her puppy.
WALTER: Sure, Angel.  I need you to root for me. (pointing at ATLANTA) They're the bad guys.  Atlanta.  We want the blue team.  New York.  They have to win by more than five points.  And root for a low score.  Both teams have to make less than 42 points total. New York and under 42 points.
WALTER: Because Brandon likes them. JULIA looks at BRANDON, smiles.  BRANDON'S barely holding up here, forces himself to find a smile in return.
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT: WALTER and BRANDON alone in the room.  Sound of the ANNOUNCERS as Atlanta get trounced by Denver.  Not even close.  Well over 42 total points scored.  The game ends.  All four bets lost. A commercial comes on.  Horrible stillness.
WALTER: That's great.
BRANDON: I can't do this anymore, Walter.  I can't sleep at night.  I can't eat.
WALTER: I made it very clear before we started what the stakes were.
WALTER: Sports betting's year-round.
BRANDON: I'm not doing this next year.
WALTER: You made a career choice!  I bankrolled it!
TONI VO: Let him go, Walter. WALTER and BRANDON turn, see TONI at the door.
WALTER: Of course you stick up for him!
TONI: Meaning what?
WALTER: Who's side are you on?
TONI: I didn't realize I had to choose.
WALTER: (to BRANDON) Look, you got a magnificent gift.  Own that.  So you strike out sometimes, big deal, you're swinging for the fences.  You're a champion, Brandon.  A champion goes down 186 times but gets up 187.  I'm not letting you stay down.  This isn't about you or me or Toni, this transcends that -- this is metaphysical, this is cosmic, this is eternal -- this is God... Besides, we have a contract.
TONI: You can't own someone, Walter.
WALTER: I created the hottest sports tout this country's ever seen! I plugged him, took out full page ads, built a show around him, hooked him up with every major client I have and I will be goddamned if he's going to walk out the door and take all that with him! Why the hell am I even explaining this to you!  This is between me and him!  Get out!
WALTER: I need you to tell me how to talk to my wife?  When I'm talking you'll shut your fucking toilet!
INT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT: BRANDON comes down the hall.  TONI and WALTER heard yelling through the office door.  BRANDON hesitates, walks out and --
INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT: Dim darkness.  A distant siren bleeds in as --
WALTER'S VOICE: Brandon... Brandon. BRANDON'S POV.  His eyes open.  WALTER'S face fills FRAME.
WALTER: Wake up.
BRANDON: What time is it?
WALTER: Five in the morning.  Listen, I gotta fly to Vegas to meet with some clients.  Hand holding thing.  Keep 'em on board for the final game.  Because you can do this thing, Brandon.  End of the season's the perfect place to turn this streak around.  I'll be back to you out to dinner.  Get you back in the groove.  9:30. Nobu. Gotta catch my flight.  See you tonight.  Look sharp. We're turning it around.
INT. NOBU - NIGHT: BRANDON alone at a table, sipping a sake when TONI, evening dress, sits next to him.
TONI: Walter was delayed, he's coming back in the morning.  Asked if I'd fill in.
TONI: Julia did her ballet recital today.  God she was beautiful.
TONI: I can't believe I'm here again.  I saw it coming.  I just... I just couldn't stop it.
TONI: He won't stop on his own.  He can't.
BRANDON: I gotta win one more game.
TONI: You can't fix this, Brandon. BRANDOn After Sunday's game I'm taking off...
EXT. BROWNSTONE STEPS - NIGHT: A cab pulls up.  BRANDON and TONI emerge.  BRANDON looks around as they start up the steps.  Both reach for their keys, regard one another.
TONI: I don't think so. She leans in to kiss him on the cheek and -- BRANDON suddenly shifts.  Their lips meet.  A casual goodbye suddenly grows in intensity as neither tries to part.  Seconds ticking by.  Things getting heated.  TONI tries to pull away.
EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME TIME: A cold wind blows off the river.  Whips through the cables of the span.  A match flares.  WALTER'S face is lit briefly by the flame.  He stands on the bridge walkway, looking down at the brownstone and --
EXT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - DAY: Gray, winter day.  View of a snow-covered window sill --
INT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - DAY: WALTER'S FACE fills a shaky HOME VIDEO VIEWFINDER, video coming close to show WALTER opening a book-size present -- removing a beautifully framed photo of TONI and JULIA.
BRANDON: Hey darlin'. Walter vo There he is.  C'mon in.  We're having a little celebration. Toni and I were married 12 years ago today.
BRANDON: It's too much. WALTER vo For what?  You're family, Brandon.  We all love each other, right? I'm like a father, you're like my son -- gee, sorry Toni, but I guess that makes you his mother.
TONI: They're for evening. WALTER vo Good, wear 'em to bed tonight. (VIDEO CAMERA back on BRANDON) Who do you think'll win the big game?
BRANDON: Turn it off. WALTEr/still taping Better yet, don't say anything.  Surprise me.  We'll break it when we do the live show.  Take your time, Brandon.  Enjoy yourself. Give Walter a smile.
EXT. TIMES SQUARE NEWS STAND - DAY: BRANDON loads up on newspapers and sports magazines and --
INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - DAY: BRANDON surrounded by a sea of sports pages, comentary, ratings. He looks up at a blaring TV and --
INT. TV PRODUCTION STUDIO BATHROOM - NIGHT: BRANDON, suit and tie, splashes water on his face, stares at himself in the mirror.  He pulls reams of stats and newspaper reports from his pocket, regards the Superbowl pick sheet.  Blank space for the winner.  Blank space for the over/under.  BRANDON fumbling with his sheets of data, desperately searching for an answer when he suddenly hurls it all in the trash.  Kicks the can.  Kicks it again.
INT. TV PRODUCTION STUDIO - NIGHT: BRANDON sits at the set.  Looks over at CHUCK, in his own world, working something from his teeth.  BRANDON Slides the pick sheet to WALTER.
BRANDON: Wanna know about the picks?
WALTER: New York minus the two-and-a-half points and the over, what should I know?
TECHNICIAN: Five, four, three, two, one --
WALTER: Hello everybody and welcome to the big weekend!  John Anthony's just given me tremendous news about his assessment!  Let me say to all of you who've used our service and those of you thinking of using it for the first time -- never before in the history of this industry has an offer been made like the one I'm about to present to you now!  I am so confident of John Anthony's picks for this Sunday, so sure of the skills he's brought to bear and so anxious to get you on the phone and dialing the toll free number on your screen that for the first time in sports service history I will guarantee our picks this weekend!  What's that mean?  Tell us how much you're betting with your bookie.  You lose, we cover!  That's right!  Risk free!  Lock Of The Millenium! Now let's go to the oracle, God's gift -- John Anthony!
BRANDON: ... Wow.  What an offer.  The phones'll be flooded.
WALTER: We're that sure!  John, rundown the pitfalls facing the average bettor.  I mean a game this huge, all the added dynamics, without your expertise most bettors might as well just... flip a coin, am I right?
EXT. TV PRODUCTION STUDIO - NIGHT: The studio doors open.  WALTER exits.  BRANDON right beside.
WALTER: You think?  Well I say if you can flip a coin to pick, I can guarantee the game!
WALTER: Fuck it, I'm ruined anyway.
BRANDON: At least cap it out!
WALTER: (turning to him) Can't you feel it, Brandon?
BRANDON: I don't know what you're talking about.
WALTER: I think you do.  The best part of the best drug in the world isn't the high.
INT. SALES OFFICE - DAY: Mayhem.  Loud and crowded.  They can't answer the phones fast enough.  A big screen TV is set up in front.  The Superbowl pre-game show is seen coming to an end.  SALESMEN machine-gun last minute calls.  Scribble like mad.
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY: BRANDON, suit and tie, looks through the glass at the feeding frenzy.  He closes the blinds.  Goes to the closet.  Hangs up his jacket.  Removes his tie and --
INT. SALES OFFICE - NIGHT: Kick-off is seconds away.  WALTER and the SALES STAFF gather around the set, turn up the sound.
2ND ANNOUNCER: Some bettor somewhere just made some money.
WALTER: That's it!  No more calls!  Kill the phones!  Kill 'em now -- right now!
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - NIGHT: TONI alone.  View across the hall into the office.  BRANDON enters, wearing his UNLV jacket and faded jeans.
INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT: BRANDON packs things into a duffel bag.  The Superbowl's on tv. The sound's off.  Play's resumed.  BRANDON removes the watch. Sets it on a nightstand beside an envelope and the Mercedes keys.  Picks up a plane ticket and --
EXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT: BRANDON comes down the steps, carrying his bag, dressed the same as the day he came.  BRANDON starts down the sidewalk.  Flags a cab.  It stops.  He opens the door, about to get in when a cheer from the SALES ROOM makes him look up and --
INT. SALES OFFICE - NIGHT: Fourth quarter.  Superbowl blaring from the tv.  New York's driving. Minutes left.  The SALES STAFF are screaming at the set, climbing over each other to get a better view and New York suddenly scores and the room erupts and WALTER'S right in the middle of it, looks around --
INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT: The door's ajar.  WALTER rushes in.
WALTER: You're missing the game!  We're back in it!  A New York touchdown and we win both bets!
TONI: I know.
WALTER: And you didn't you tell me?
TONI: He asked me not to.
WALTER: Just like that?  No goodbye?
TONI: I'm sure it's in the letter.
WALTER: I'm sure it is... I wonder what's not in here?
TONI: What do you mean?
WALTER: What do you mean, what do I mean?  When it comes to Brandon you seem to have all the answers.
WALTER: He said that to you?
TONI: Yeah, loud and clear, by leaving.
WALTER: I think it's something else.
TONI: Yeah, tell me.
WALTER: You know.
TONI: No. ON -- the TV.  New York's driving.  Game reaching a head.  A clock in the corner counts down the final two minutes.
TONI: You're missing the game.
WALTER: No I'm not.  This is the game.
INT. JFK AIRLINE TERMINAL - NIGHT: BRANDON travels down an escalator and --
INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT: TONI at the door.  WALTER approaches.
WALTER: Something was bothering him.  I mean sure, maybe he was homesick. Or I was thinking maybe he had such, you know, deep feelings for me he couldn't face saying goodbye.  What a minute.  I just
TONI: Do I have to?
WALTER: I know you did!
TONI: Really?  Another "lock of the year?"
WALTER: I saw you, Toni!  I saw you go into his room that night!  This room!  With him!  I never went to Vegas!
INT. JFK AIRLINE TERMINAL - NIGHT: BRANDON walks through FRAME.  PASSENGERS rush for flights and--
INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT: TONI and WALTER in the middle of it --
TONI: You mean you lied to me about the trip!
WALTER: Don't talk to me about lying!
TONI: I guess you had the whole thing planned?
WALTER: Don't make this about me!
TONI: Put me out there on a tray!
WALTER: Yeah, I put the tray out there -- but you didn't have to shove an apple in your mouth and jump on it!  On him!
TONI: You played me!
WALTER: You're damn right I did!
TONI: ... Brandon was right.  Son of a bitch!
WALTER: You don't deny it!
TONI: Best pick he ever made.
WALTER: What the hell are you talking about?
INT. JFK AIRPORT BAR - NIGHT: PASSENGERS watch the Superbowl on a tv over the bar.  Final seconds. BRANDON appears.  Stands outside.  CROWD of people around the set, it looks like the last play and --
INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT: TONI before WALTER.  Inches away --
TONI: You were gambling with me that night, Walter.  Brandon knew it. Knew you.  He told me he was sure you were watching somehow. So he asked me in to spend the night, put on a show.  I didn't believe him -- I mean after all we've been through -- but I figured what the hell.
INT. SALESROOM - NIGHT: The room's at fever pitch, everyone screaming at the TV and --
INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT: WALTER still as a statue.  Game in the BG.  TONI rolling --
INT. JFK AIRPORT BAR - NIGHT: CAMERA on the tv.  Blaring the game.  Bar going crazy as the New York QUARTERBACK runs for the end zone.  Juking LINEMEN. Dodging tackles.  Nearing the goal.  A last-second block clears a lane and the QUARTERBACK barrels by, dives -- a hit -- a fumble on the goal line -- a beat -- a replay -- a REFEREE signaling a touchdown -- and the game's over -- and New York has won, but more importantly they've covered the spread and --
BRANDON'S DAD: Hello, Brandon?
BRANDON: Hey, hey the big winner.  What's going on?
BRANDON'S DAD: Nothing much... the usual.
BRANDON: C'mon, I know it's rough, it's supposed to be.  A friend turned me on to the place.  She said it's the best.
BRANDON: I don't know, but I got an airport full of planes to choose from.
BRANDON: Yeah, I told her.
BRANDON'S DAD: Great pick on New York.  It's like I always said, you don't bet quarterbacks and receivers--
BRANDON: Go get 'em! The KIDS scramble across the field, other TEAM seen suited and ready.  PARENTS on the sideline.  One of BRANDON'S tiny TEAMMATES hangs back, approaches BRANDON.
BRANDON: ... I'd bet on it. BRANDON drapes an arm over the KID, walks him to the game --
