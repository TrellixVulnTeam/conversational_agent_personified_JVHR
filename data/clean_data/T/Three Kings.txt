TROY: Are we shooting people, or what?
TROY: SOLDIER #1 ( O.S. )
TROY: what I'm trying to find out.
SOLDIER #3: It looks like a grain of sand, but I don't know how I'm gonna get it
VIG: Troy turns, upset, murmurs "I Get Around" by the Beach Boys.
TROY: "Gettin' bugged drivin' up and down the same old strip, gotta find a new place where the kids are hip, I get around "
SOLDIER #1: I didn't think I'd see anyone get shot over here.
VIG: It looked like the guy's head blew three feet into the air
SOLDIER #1: Bullshit, that's not what happened.
VIG: I said it happened, but then we got here and he was still breathing.
SOLDIER #2: Oh, my God, it's just like 'Predator,' where the guy, the black guy
SOLDIER #3: Carl Weathers. His arm gets shot And when it hits the ground, his hand keeps on firing.
VIG: And when it hits the ground, his hand keeps on firing.
SOLDIER #5: Take my picture.
VIG: Do you still want to sell pictures?
TROY: ( distracted monotone ) For twenty.
SOLDIER #5: Twenty dollars, man, what's the meaning of life?
TROY: You're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war.
VIG: War's been over five days, Jim, ain't gonna be much more of this.
SOLDIER #5: Bobby, take my picture.
SOLDIER #4: If he shot the guy, it's up to him.
SOLDIER #5: It's not like he shot a fucking deer. It's the enemy.
VIG: Troy's enemy, yours for twenty.
TROY: Accept no substitute, this is the real thing, oh, Jesus [winces]
VIG: What's wrong?
TROY: I got a really bad headache all of a sudden
VIG: No free pictures, motherfucker.
ARCHIE GATES: Is that what you got from this experience? A goddamn watch?
HAVICHON: Ees a great fucking watch.
ARCHIE GATES: There's 700 million in gold out there and you're fucking around with a watch?
HAVICHON: Bon dieu de merde, that's a lot of gold, man.
ARCHIE GATES: One bunker of gold and we retire from this horseshit, Hashy
BILL SMITHSON: ARCHIE GATES
ARCHIE GATES: is how do you find it?
HAVICHON: Like one sowsan bunker out sair
ARCHIE GATES: Maybe two sowsan bunker out sair, Hash, how do you find Saddam's for Chrissakes?
BILL SMITHSON: for Chrissakes?
ARCHIE GATES: My goodness, Bill, what seems to be the problem?
BILL SMITHSON: I'm trying to do a story here and the fucking sand is blowing in my You want me to stop the sand? I can't do anything about that.
ARCHIE GATES: You want me to stop the sand? I can't do anything about that.
BILL SMITHSON: No, you're too busy talking about the fucking gold, which by the way makes a great story if you'd get me a goddamn lead on it
ARCHIE GATES: I think the Saddam story goes more for the jugular, journalistically speaking, I mean, he's still here beating the shit out of his Would you just be my guide and not my fucking producer? You're my OK, go do your celebration story,
BILL SMITHSON: Would you just be my guide and not my fucking producer? You're my OK, go do your celebration story,
ARCHIE GATES: OK, go do your celebration story,
SOLDIER #5: SOLDIER #6 BILL SMITHSON
SOLDIER #6: BILL SMITHSON
BILL SMITHSON: You're heroes.
SOLDIER #6: We're heroes.
SOLDIER #7: Give war a chance.
BILL SMITHSON: You've exorcised the ghosts of Vietnam with a clear moral Is that what we did?
SOLDIER #5: Is that what we did?
BILL SMITHSON: Archie is walking off with CATHY DAITCH a young reporter.
ARCHIE GATES: BILL SMITHSON
BILL SMITHSON: reporters, goddamn it.
SOLDIER #1: We kicked ass.
SOLDIER #6: We didn't get rid of fucking Which totally sucks a big dick.
SOLDIER #8: Which totally sucks a big dick.
SOLDIER #6: Those people are getting reemed
SOLDIER #7: Bullshit, we saved Kuwait, man.
BILL SMITHSON: Who's getting reemed? The Shiites?
SOLDIER #8: I don't know who they are, man
SOLDIER #6: We got big firepower but we ain't saving them
SOLDIER #5: Fuck that, we liberated Kuwait.
SOLDIER #1: Five soldiers chant Lee Greenwood's anthem, "Proud to Be An American" into Smithson's camera
CHOPPER PILOTS: 'be livin' here today because the flag still stands for freedom and they can't take that awayyyyy '
TROY: ( screaming the song ) And I'm proud I to be an American, where at least I know I'm free. And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me. And I'd gladly stand up; next to you and defend her still today. Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land, God bless the U S A
TROY: Vig screams into Troy's face at point blank range.
VIG: CAPTAIN VAN METER
TROY: CAPTAIN VAN METER
FIVE IRAQIS: on their knees, plead for mercy in Arabic as they disrobe. They grab and kiss Troy Barlow's hand, as he holds his M-16 on the begging Iraqis.
TROY: It's cool, no one's gonna hurt Did you rape and torture anybody in Kuwait, Abdul?
VIG: Did you rape and torture anybody in Kuwait, Abdul?
TROY: You're making them all hysterical.
VIG: Take your fucking rags off, take this off. No comprende English, What is your fucking problem, I'm trying to git him to obey the spirit of things but he won't take his rags off.
TROY: What is your fucking problem, I'm trying to git him to obey the spirit of things but he won't take his rags off.
VIG: I'm trying to git him to obey the spirit of things but he won't take his rags off.
TROY: ( leans down ) Sir? We need you to disrobe like all the other towel heads, OK?
VIG: Whoa, it's a freaky thing, Troy.
TROY: There's a document in that guy's ass, Conrad.
VIG: That's the freaky thing.
WALTER: Do you think he ate it?
TROY: It wouldn't come out perfect like that if he ate it.
TROY: Go get it, Private.
IRAQI OFFICER: Hasa man timal!
TROY: Open it up.
VIG: You only gave me one glove.
TROY: I'm sorry I don't have another, but you gotta open it up. That's how the chain of command works.
VIG: What the hell is that?
TROY: Important enough to squeeze your cheeks for.
CATHY DAITCH: You are a trained warrior, trained warrior, trained warrior, Jesus Christ, Colonel!
CATHY DAITCH: ( breathless ) What's Bill got?
ARCHIE GATES: Just the celebration story.
CATHY DAITCH: That's it?
ARCHIE GATES: That's it
ARCHIE GATES: How about you? Did you find It could be another bullshit lead but I need you to help me find a guy who might have something on the gold
CATHY DAITCH: It could be another bullshit lead but I need you to help me find a guy who might have something on the gold
ARCHIE GATES: Who's the guy?
CATHY DAITCH: Somebody Barlow, maybe in Company
B: ARCHIE GATES CATHY DAITCH
ARCHIE GATES: CATHY DAITCH
CATHY DAITCH: Got a map out of a prisoner's head.
ARCHIE GATES: Out of a prisoner's head?
CATHY DAITCH: Or his ear, or his ass, or his dick, and they got like a fifty page full-color mini atlas of Saddam's bunkers
ARCHIE GATES: Out of a guy's dick?
GENERAL PYE: This is not the way we service the media, Major. Stop her
MP: You are in violation of code 37D, grinding Major Gates.
ARCHIE GATES: You guys have no manners
BILL SMITHSON: GENERAL PYE
GENERAL PYE: We're handling this, OK?
BILL SMITHSON: and he took off on me
ARCHIE GATES: That's a lot of bullshit.
GENERAL PYE: I give you a prestige job in the media war of the century and the guy feels neglected.
ARCHIE GATES: I'm helping him plenty with his big celebration feature Where did you get this fucking star?
GENERAL HORN: They made me a general, pal.
ARCHIE GATES: For what? I don't even know what we did over here, but Schwartzkopf gets a book deal, you get a star, Powell gets to be fucking Are you high? This is a huge win for us.
GENERAL HORN: Are you high? This is a huge win for us.
ARCHIE GATES: Running the press pool's a real big win for me.
GENERAL PYE: You want us to kill more Americans to occupy Iraq?
ARCHIE GATES: I'm just saying it's ironic, that's all.
GENERAL HORN: What the fuck is ironic?
ARCHIE GATES: We got the biggest army in the world here but Iraq still has the d-bag dictator in power, but that's how the world works I guess.
GENERAL PYE: Just take care of Smithson and maybe he'll hook you up to consult on movies.
GENERAL HORN: It's either that or be a security guard when you retire.
ARCHIE GATES: Fuck you, Ron.
GENERAL HORN: I'm a general now, you can't say fuck you to me.
ARCHIE GATES: OK, sir, but there's another thing I'd like to say, if you don't mind.
GENERAL HORN: Go right ahead, Colonel.
ARCHIE GATES: Fuuuuuck yooouuuu, Ronnnnn.
TROY: You've washed your hands like a thousand times, Conrad.
VIG: Lord knows what vermin live in the butt of a dune koon.
DOC: Why do you let this cracker follow you around?
TROY: He's a good kid.
DOC: He's a wall-eyed cracker.
TROY: He's got no high school, man, he's from a group home in Jackson
DOC: I don't give a shit if he's from Johannesburg. I don't want to hear dune koon or sand nigger from him or anybody.
VIG: Captain uses those terms.
TROY: The point is, Conrad, 'towel head' and 'camel jockey' are perfectly good substitutes.
DOC: I'm sorry, man, it's a little confusing is all.
VIG: I'm sorry, man, it's a little confusing is all.
DOC: What can I do for your headache?
TROY: Got any Vicadan?
DOC: All gone. How about Caffergot?
TROY: Excellent. Let's translate my Iraqi ass map.
TROY: Van Meter's at the big pow wow?
DOC: We're cool for at least three hours, but keep Walter on the door.
TROY: Would you take those fucking things off?
WALTER: I never got to use night vision.
TROY: They don't work during the day and stand outside the tent.
DOC: These are definitely Saddam's bunkers near Karbala.
TROY: What's inside?
DOC: According to Intelligence Picasso, Armani, Rolex, Mercedes, Sony you name it Kuwait was Muslim Beverly Hills and Saddam sacked it.
VIG: Man, get an awesome stereo system with like ten BOS speakers
TROY: Silver Lexus convertible.
DOC: Lexus doesn't make a convertible.
TROY: Yes, they do.
DOC: Infiniti has one coming.
TROY: You're wrong.
DOC: You can't get a car home from here If I get enough Rolexes I could buy one when I got home.
TROY: If I get enough Rolexes I could buy one when I got home.
VIG: One gold Rolex, I get a very fine split level outside Jackson.
TROY: My one problem, see, is the risk What risk? We already did the risk. I signed up last year to bank some computer training
DOC: What risk? We already did the risk. I signed up last year to bank some computer training
TROY: Tell me about it.
DOC: Next thing I know I'm sitting here waiting to get hit by a Scud. I put my life on the line for what purpose I'm not sure, and now the good Lord puts this map in my He could put a land mine in your path if we try to find this You're safe with me.
TROY: He could put a land mine in your path if we try to find this You're safe with me.
DOC: You're safe with me.
TROY: Cuz you have a galactic plutonium I don't talk about it. But I do have a ring of Jesus fire.
DOC: I don't talk about it. But I do have a ring of Jesus fire.
TROY: You have a ring of Jesus fire.
DOC: I was fire baptized.
VIG: I was baptized in water.
DOC: I'm fire baptized.
TROY: I don't even know what water baptism means.
DOC: For those who understand, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't, no explanation will suffice. You can benefit from my Jesus ring if you do right by me, you got that?
TROY: CUT TO
CUT TO: POV WALTER'S NIGHT VISION BLURRY IMAGE OF ARCHIE WALKING right up to Walter.
WALTER: This tent is restricted
ARCHIE GATES: Get the fuck out of my way.
WALTER: May day, may day
CUT TO: Troy and Doc scramble to put the maps under the table.
ARCHIE GATES: Good afternoon.
ARCHIE GATES: Would this be the proctology tent?
DOC: Yes, sir, I mean, no, sir.
ARCHIE GATES: Then maybe it's the urology tent.
TROY: Captain's at a staff meeting.
ARCHIE GATES: That's OK, I'm not looking for a proctologist or a urologist I'm looking for Sargeant Barlow.
ARCHIE GATES: You're on the path to truth when you smell shit, isn't that what they say?
VIG: I don't recognize you, sir. Are you in this division?
DOC: He's not in this division. He's Special Forces.
DOC: He's the guy taking Bill Smithson And you would be the Three Wise Men, right, Mappy, Slappy, and
ARCHIE GATES: And you would be the Three Wise Men, right, Mappy, Slappy, and
ARCHIE GATES: That leaves Cappy outside.
CUT TO: Walter, outside the tent, practices blocking positions.
WALTER: Damn. Freeze. Do not pass. Hold it, freeze. Stop. Freeze.
CUT TO: His name is Walter.
VIG: His name is Walter.
ARCHIE GATES: Did you good soldiers present this map to Captain Van Meter?
TROY: Not yet.
ARCHIE GATES: Then I'll take it to him.
TROY: We'll take it to him. Sir.
ARCHIE GATES: It won't do either of us any good then, will it?
TROY: He's our commander, sir. We'd have to tell him you took it.
ARCHIE GATES: It could be nothing but a sandy love letter from one Eye-raqi to It's a series of bunkers near Not maybe, definitely. Recon photos match the map.
TROY: It's a series of bunkers near Not maybe, definitely. Recon photos match the map.
ARCHIE GATES: Not maybe, definitely. Recon photos match the map.
TROY: Not maybe, definitely. Recon photos match the map.
ARCHIE GATES: May I look at the goddamn map?
VIG: ARCHIE GATES
ARCHIE GATES: That's what makes Rangers badass, we get the best flashlights.
ARCHIE GATES: Still looks like a series of three bunkers in three villages. A bit farther to the west.
DOC: Seventy-five klicks north.
ARCHIE GATES: More like 65.
TROY: Much closer to Karbala.
ARCHIE GATES: Leave at dawn, back by lunch, not a big deal. Of course
ARCHIE GATES: there could be nothing inside but starving Arabs and stolen watches, but I think it's worth checking out, even if I have to do it with clueless reservists like
ARCHIE GATES: I mean, I could take the map, but you could talk, it starts to become a pain in the ass for me, so we'll do the gold together.
DOC: What gold?
ARCHIE GATES: You don't even know what's inside these bunkers, do you?
VIG: ARCHIE GATES
ARCHIE GATES: Rolexes are swell, but I'm talking about Kuwaiti bullion.
VIG: You mean the little cubes you put in hot water for soup?
ARCHIE GATES: No. Not the little cubes you put in hot water for soup.
TROY: Gold bricks.
ARCHIE GATES: 5 kilos each, $50,000 in today's For one gold brick?
VIG: For one gold brick?
ARCHIE GATES: I'm sure Mr. Hussein has divided his bricks. into many different hiding places, but just one hiding place should be easy to take, and that would be enough to get us out of our day jobs. Unless the three kings are in love with their day
BACK TO: I don't really have a day job.
VIG: I don't really have a day job.
TROY: What about the risk of taking a Humvee and all that
ARCHIE GATES: We do this shit all the time.
VIG: What else did you do, sir?
ARCHIE GATES: In Panama we went sailing in Noriega's boats.
TROY: ARCHIE GATES
ARCHIE GATES: In Vietnam, we got a big gold Buddha, which we unfortunately dropped in a swamp by accident.
DOC: What about Iraqi soldiers?
ARCHIE GATES: Let's see. They had the shit bombed out them for two months, they're deserting all over the place, and they've completely surrendered to us. That's a beaten army in every sense of the word.
ARCHIE GATES: You are now under my command,
ARCHIE GATES: What's the guy's name outside?
TROY: ARCHIE GATES
ARCHIE GATES: Walter comes in.
ARCHIE GATES: You will take Bill Smithson on a special mission to find the gold story, but it will be a meaningless ride that lasts all morning and takes him nowhere near Karbala, is that clear?
WALTER: How am I gonna get out of the Your captain will be detained by a friend of mine.
ARCHIE GATES: Your captain will be detained by a friend of mine.
VIG: Is it true you got to take an enemy ear to be Special Forces?
ARCHIE GATES: No, but if you talk to anybody about this, I'll kill you.
CATHY DAITCH: Very dashing.
CATHY DAITCH: Would you ever stand like that?
CATHY DAITCH: You'll get used to it. First question: did you dream as a boy you'd be commanding an infantry company in a desert war?
DOC: Troy throws a painted football into the desert. Doc fires the M-16 and blows the ball to pieces. Archie drives and moves his hand to the Bach. The convertible Humvee is loaded with weaponry and gear, a mounted 60 mm machine gun, a Bart Simpson doll on the grill. The Humvee rolls into the vast desert, littered with burned out tanks, black craters, overturned vehicles, no people.
DOC: Troy throws another ball, Doc blows it away.
TROY: Doc throws a football from the moving Humvee, Troy fires a pistol and misses the ball as it bounces to the desert.
TROY: I gave you a better arc, Doc.
DOC: What are you talking about?
TROY: I threw the ball in a higher arc that was easier for you to hit.
DOC: Blacks make better receivers than Stop speaking right now, Conrad.
VIG: Blacks make better receivers than Stop speaking right now, Conrad.
TROY: Stop speaking right now, Conrad.
DOC: Warren Moon is an excellent The Oilers have gone nowhere behind Warren Moon.
VIG: The Oilers have gone nowhere behind Warren Moon.
DOC: Randall Cunningham.
TROY: Don't get down in the mud with him, Doc.
VIG: The Eagles will never get to the Superbowl with him.
DOC: Doug Williams took the Redskins to the Superbowl and won, OK?
TROY: excellent black quarterbacks. Hit it, you sorry-assed cracker
DOC: Hit it, you sorry-assed cracker
VIG: This gun's too heavy to shoot one-handed like a movie star
ARCHIE GATES: They sit in embarrassed silence; the joyous Bach choir plays.
ARCHIE GATES: When we pull up to the bunker, the approach is something called violence of action, which is standard in special operations. It means your movement is so fast and decisive that the guards are frozen and we haven't fired a single shot.
TROY: ARCHIE GATES
ARCHIE GATES: We dropped a lot of bombs out here and we buried some guys alive
VIG: What do you mean?
ARCHIE GATES: Bradleys with big plows cut through the berms and covered the
ARCHIE GATES: Let's rehearse.
ARCHIE GATES: We'll say the cow is the primary guard outside the bunker. We pull up fast, and stop short.
TROY: Got it.
ARCHIE GATES: The cow stares as the Humvee pulls up to it fast. Troy and Doc jump out, pistols drawn, flank the cow The cow steps back, and explodes. Troy and Doc stand splattered with cow entrails. The cow's head lands with a thud on the hood of the Humvee.
ARCHIE GATES: Who's hurt?
DOC: It's all cow, I think.
VIG: Yeah, it's all cow.
DOC: They said this was swept for mines.
ARCHIE GATES: Mines are forever, Doc. They never get all of 'em.
TROY: ( low murmur ) 'If you could, help me Rhonda, help help me Rhonda '
ARCHIE GATES: Did you guys see any action at all?
VIG: Only night bombing on CNN, except for Troy's supercool shooting that guy in the neck
ARCHIE GATES: Is sepsis cool?
VIG: What's sepsis?
DOC: Infection of the blood.
ARCHIE GATES: As in septic tank, because that's what happens when a bullet hits you. The lead tears in there
ARCHIE GATES: But other than a wound that blinds, paralyzes, or castrates, the worst wound I've ever seen is something called tension pneumo I heard something about that
DOC: I heard something about that
VIG: Tension pneumo what?
ARCHIE GATES: A bullet, or a blade doesn't kill you, but makes a little hole in the lung, so every time you breathe, a little air leaks into the chest cavity, which starts to fill up like a balloon. And that balloon starts to push your organs to the side, crushing your lung, your liver, your heart. Your own breathing kills you, one breath at a time kinda like a job you can't stand or a bad lie you once That's not fatal, they can stop it.
DOC: That's not fatal, they can stop it.
ARCHIE GATES: If you know how to make another little hole in the chest to let the air out, just like you would with an overinflated tire.
TROY: Can we play the Beach Boys when we go in?
DOC: The goddamn Beach Boys.
TROY: I'm not ashamed of liking the Beach Boys. It calms me down. Better than Mozart.
ARCHIE GATES: EXT. DESERT - DAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT 'I Get Around' by The Beach Boys BLASTS as the Humvee speeds along. A big American flag flaps in the breeze from a pole at the back of the Hummer. The Humvee drives fast into the central square of a small village of low, sand-colored stucco buildings and shanties. Vig drives as the Humvee speeds around the town square, zooming past scared Shiites in black robes, a few skinny dogs, a few bewildered Iraqi soldiers.
VIG: ARCHIE GATES
ARCHIE GATES: He studies the map and points to a decayed green building.
ARCHIE GATES: Vig jerks the wheel right. They drive fast.
ARCHIE GATES: No there.
VIG: We are the Army of the United States of America. We are here to protect you. Remain calm.
ARCHIE GATES: Orders from President Bush, step
IRAQI MOTHER: No milk. Baby milk.
ARCHIE GATES: EXT. BUNKER - DAY Iraqi women and children kiss Vig's feet. The five Iraqi soldiers exit the bunker with their hands raised, and the starved Shiite civilians spit and throw stones at them while 'I Get Around' keeps playing.
VIG: ( into the megaphone ) We are here for your protection and safety.
VIG: U.S. Marines in charge here.
TROY: He holds his shoulder in pain. Archie kicks the door repeatedly. Troy joins him, it finally flies open.
TROY: Troy is embraced by an Iraqi soldier, about 25.
FRIENDLY IRAQI: I am love United States of Freedom. I am hate Saddam.
TROY: Doc points his pistol in the Iraqi's face.
DOC: Let him go.
FRIENDLY IRAQI: No problem, my friend.
FRIENDLY IRAQI: You look for the chemical weapon?
TROY: No. We look for the gold.
ARCHIE GATES: FRIENDLY IRAQI
FRIENDLY IRAQI: Archie pulls out the infrared map and shows it to the Iraqi, who says nothing.
DOC: ARCHIE GATES
ARCHIE GATES: They point their guns. It's a show. Archie holds the map.
TROY: They point their guns. It's a show. Archie holds the map.
ARCHIE GATES: FRIENDLY IRAQI ( points to map )
FRIENDLY IRAQI: ( points to map ) This bunker. I'll take you.
CHILD: Vig looks terrified as the crowd scatters, leaving him alone as he points his big unloaded pistol. The soldiers point their rifles as they come towards Vig, when suddenly two of them look to the side and shout.
ARCHIE GATES: Archie shoves Shiite peasants out of the Humvee.
SHIITE WOMAN: She holds a SHIRTLESS BOY of 7 with a bandage around his entire chest. Doc pushes her off the Humvee.
SHIITE MAN: America help.
ARCHIE GATES: Troy rips open a large duffel and starts handing out Army Meal Rations to the crowd Vig leans on the horn. The friendly Iraqi jumps into the rear of the Hummer as it starts to pull away. Archie shoves the friendly Iraqi out, and he lands on his ass in the swarm of chasing Shiites. Archie and Troy look back at the debacle as they pull away.
BILL SMITHSON: damn story, goddamn it, where the hell is the gold?
WALTER: out by the marshes?
BILL SMITHSON: in spite of massive pollution
WALTER: in spite of massive pollution
BILL SMITHSON: Walter keeps driving.
DOC: I'm all right, I'm cool.
ARCHIE GATES: What is the art of war, because it is not for killing people, it's a stratagem to give life to many by killing the evil perpetrated by a few I am burning up in this goddamn suit
ARCHIE GATES: Discriminating use of violence as a last resort, and even then, carefully, surgically, that's what I learned, that's what I'm good at. But now they underestimate all this, bomb the same towns for six weeks and still leave the scumbag dictator to starve and butcher his own people.
TROY: ( agitated ) I don't even know what happened back there. Civilians were spitting on their own soldiers; the soldiers were shooting the civilians and ignoring us
DOC: They already surrendered to us. Now they're after Shiites.
VIG: What exactly is a Shiite?
ARCHIE GATES: They make up the ethnic majority but they don't have any power. When Bush pulled us out, he told them to start a civil war to bring Saddam down, and now they're getting wasted.
VIG: ( totally puzzled ) The civil war? How could it be the civil war?
TROY: It's a war inside the same country, Conrad. That's a civil
ARCHIE GATES: Put these on, we are now U.S. I can't do this, OK? Because I've got a family and if I shit in a bag the rest of my life cuz I got shot after the war's already over that would be pretty fucking stupid, wouldn't it?
TROY: I can't do this, OK? Because I've got a family and if I shit in a bag the rest of my life cuz I got shot after the war's already over that would be pretty fucking stupid, wouldn't it?
ARCHIE GATES: What is the most important thing in life?
TROY: What the fuck are you talking What is it?
ARCHIE GATES: What is it?
TROY: Did you hear anything I said.
VIG: Respect is the most important.
ARCHIE GATES: Too dependent on other people.
DOC: ARCHIE GATES
ARCHIE GATES: Comes and goes, man.
TROY: What is this bullshit?
DOC: What's the most important thing?
ARCHIE GATES: Necessity. That's what dictates what will happen at any given time in life. Necessity says we don't spend American lives taking out Saddam, which leaves Saddam the necessity of taking out the Shiites so he can stay in power, which leaves us to take the gold.
TROY: We could've been shot.
ARCHIE GATES: us? We decimated their entire country. They're scared shitless of us. [looks at his watch] There's time to try another bunker. I say we go.
DOC: Let's do it.
VIG: Rock and roll.
TROY: OK. And I'll be wearing fashionable kevlar. As a necessity.
BILL SMITHSON: ( on cell phone ) I'm at some goddamn marsh, all we've seen are Russian cranes.
WALTER: BILL SMITHSON ( on the cell phone )
BILL SMITHSON: ( on the cell phone ) I think the Saddam story goes more for the jugular, journalistically speaking, Al. Let's grow some balls and do the Shiite uprising, for Christ's sake.
BILL SMITHSON: We're going north to do the I thought the gold was the hot Karbala's the new hotspot, and I'm driving.
WALTER: I thought the gold was the hot Karbala's the new hotspot, and I'm driving.
BILL SMITHSON: Karbala's the new hotspot, and I'm driving.
WALTER: Military regulations, you cannot
WALTER: Get off the vehicle, sir.
WALTER: Don't make me shoot you, sir.
GENERAL HORN: What the fuck are you doing?
GENERAL HORN: Do you have authorization?
GENERAL HORN: CAPTAIN VAN METER GENERAL HORN
GENERAL HORN: Who gave you this?
GENERAL HORN: Archie Gates gave you this? Jesus Christ, Doug, come with me.
GENERAL HORN: No, you don't get to do the
ARCHIE GATES: Bach's 'Gloria' plays loud as Vig drives and Archie stares straight ahead as the Humvee picks up speed.
ARCHIE GATES: ( into the megaphone ) United States Marine Corps. Put your weapons down.
TROY: Troy and Doc shove the two Iraqis face down in the dirt and cuff their hands behind their backs.
DOC: Troy and Doc shove the two Iraqis face down in the dirt and cuff their hands behind their backs.
VIG: Don't make me smoke your ass,
TROY: A large room; walls lined with shelves full of brand new appliances: blenders, cuisinarts, CD players, small TVs. A huge portrait of Saddam Hussein covers one wall. A television plays a rerun of 'Happy Days' in Arabic. Another TV: CNN's first reports of the Rodney King beating. An IRAQI CAPTAIN sits in a chair in front of the TVs. TWO IRAQIS sit loading rifles. Two others sit at a radio. They all jump to their feet when Archie bursts in, except for the officer watching 'Happy Days' and CNN..
ARCHIE GATES: in Safwan, March 3, the United States Marines hereby confiscate all material stolen by Iraq from the Emirate of Kuwait
TROY: The other rifle-loader stands looking scared.
ARCHIE GATES: Never hit anyone with your pistol, Sorry about that.
DOC: Sorry about that.
IRAQI CAPTAIN: For wife.
ARCHIE GATES: I've been divorced three times.
TROY: No, newest and best has better noise reduction.
TROY: Less distortion. Get down on the floor, OK?
TROY: This is bad music, understand? It's bad for you.
ARCHIE GATES: ( to Iraqi Captain ) Where's the gold, Captain? Tell us so we don't have to kill you.
TROY: There's another room over here.
IRAQI SARGEANT: I am just do my job, buddy.

ARCHIE GATES: give it a five second fuse. That gives you two steps out the door.
ARCHIE GATES: EXT. BUNKER Imam, lying in a ditch, is concealed on the side of the bunker, and aims an old rifle at the chopper. GUNSHOTS ring off the side of the chopper, chipping plastic. The chopper banks toward Vig in response. Vig watches the chopper turn toward him.
VIG: God help me.
ARCHIE GATES: EXT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY Archie FIRES his pistol as he goes out the door with Troy, also FIRING a pistol. Doc follows with the ball, fuse burning. Doc throws the ball hard at the chopper, hovering 40 feet up.

IMAM: This guy was worth saving.
ARCHIE GATES: He's a soldier.
VIG: Vig comes running.
VIG: Troy smiles as he steps in the direction of Vig. Suddenly a RIFLE SHOT RINGS OUT, Troy jumps. SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION Vig is hit in the collar bone, ONLY THE SOUND OF THE BULLET SMASHING HIS FLESH AND BONE. He is jerked, falls to his knees, but gets up, keeps staggering toward Troy, 125 yards away. Troy looks stunned. Archie turns sharply to his right and FIRES a rifle. An IRAQI SOLDIER, 150 yards to the side, drops to the ground as Archie and Doc continue to hit him with gunfire. Troy runs as hard as he can toward Vig.
ARCHIE GATES: Doc looks around frantically with his pistol pointed. Archie scans the area and directs 3 SHIITE RIFLEMEN to spread out.

IMAM: ( translates ) Haza janav yasat.

TROY: hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done
DOC: hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done
ARCHIE GATES: He runs hard across the desert toward Troy. Troy falls next to Vig and they look at each other. Troy's eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great difficulty RASPING.
TROY'S POV: looking up at Doc, who is saying something to Troy, but there's NO SOUND EXCEPT TROY'S LABORED BREATHING The POV turns to the side Vig is no longer breathing. FLASHBACK TO THE OPENING SCENE, but with weird, MUFFLED
SOUND: SOLDIER #5
SOLDIER #5: Take my picture.
VIG: Do you still want to sell pictures?
TROY: ( distracted monotone ) For twenty.
SOLDIER #5: Twenty bucks?

TROY: He's got no family.
ARCHIE GATES: We're his family now.
DOC: He wanted to go to one of those Kajatar in Iran. We can take him.
IMAM: Kajatar in Iran. We can take him.

TROY: How long can I keep doing this?
ARCHIE GATES: Maybe four hours, if you're not bleeding too bad inside.
TROY: I'm really thirsty.
DOC: There's no water anywhere.
IMAM: ( to Archie ) I got you hooked up if you want to call your man.
ARCHIE GATES: ( into the radio ) Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, do you read me?
DOC: We're gonna be court-martialed.
ARCHIE GATES: No, we're not.

WALTER: ( into radio ) About two clicks outside camp.
WALTER: ( into the radio )
WALTER: I think so who handles the briar patch?
WALTER: Oh, OK, and the Tar Baby goes to the briar patch if everything's OK, right?
WALTER: Shit, I'm sorry, sir, I don't remember how the code goes
ARCHIE GATES: Six personnel trucks and a Humvee.
WALTER: Wow. That's a tall order for a secret operation, sir.
ARCHIE GATES: Talk to my friend Hash. Each driver will get 100K.
WALTER: Did you say 100K?
ARCHIE GATES: Roger. Brer Rabbit at 239 North. Add one medavac pack to the order, and dump the reporter.

GENERAL HORN: ( reads ) Fort Bragg? I'll be damned.
BILL SMITHSON: Where the hell is he going now?
CATHY DAITCH: I say we keep watching the General.
LATER: Everyone sits and waits: Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his daughter, 105 Shiite peasants. Troy looks pained, then releases the valve on the tube sticking through his chest bandage and there is a hiss of air. He looks relieved. There is the SOUND OF DISTANT MOTORS RUMBLING. An approaching convoy in the desert: six open U.S. personnel trucks, led by a Humvee. Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his daughter, dozens of Shiites watch the convoy approaching they hold their guns ready. The U.S. Military trucks and the Humvee pull up to the bunker. Walter stands in the front of the Humvee with Hash, both wearing sand goggles as they pull up Walter salutes.
HAVICHON: Quelle gonzesse, Archie, you got yourself shot.
ARCHIE GATES: Those better be words of sympathy.
WALTER: Watcha doing out here, Troy?
TROY: Protecting the free peoples of the world, Walter, you know how it is.
WALTER: We better get you fixed up to go home to the land of the brave.

ARCHIE GATES: Part of the deal.
HAVICHON: C'est super, Archie, you got yourself a pain in the ass mission of mercy.
WALTER: Sorry I fucked up the code, sir.
ARCHIE GATES: It means we gotta move. They might be coming for us.
HAVICHON: What are you seenking?
ARCHIE GATES: I see an opening we can walk through. But it's not wide enough for a truck.
ARCHIE GATES: We'll walk them to the border. The Iranians will take them. We'll walk back to the trucks and get out of here.
ARCHIE GATES: ( translates ) Jihad yamat yamat.
IMAM: ( translates ) Jihad yamat yamat.
DOC: Let the air out.
TROY: It's not the air, I don't know what it is
DOC: Stay back.
TROY: I'm all right. I'm just dizzy or
ARCHIE GATES: He lets go of Troy and starts jogging toward the border. Troy cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others. The Shiites look up at the choppers as they jog. Doc and Walter look up also. Archie does not. Havichon in the Humvee swings the mounted gun up to the choppers as they pass overhead, loud. PAN UP TO Six Apaches hover over everyone's heads and land in the 50 yards between Archie and the border, blocking his path, blowing up dust. Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, the Shiites turn and wince in the blowing sand. 10 U.S. MILITARY POLICE jump from the landing choppers, followed by another TEN U.S. TROOPS with rifles. Iraqi soldiers watch apprehensively. M.P.S grab Archie, Troy, And Doc, and pull them away from the Shiites. Troy shouts over the choppers.
TROY: U.S. soldiers push the Shiites toward the border. The Shiites, including two who carry Vig's body, run toward the border unaccompanied by American protection.
ARCHIE GATES: Troy pulls away from MPS, resisting arrest.
TROY: Plastic handcuffs are put onto Troy, behind his back.
TROY: Archie and Doc, not resisting, are handcuffed in front
ARCHIE GATES: He and Doc are pulled away from Troy. Iraqi soldiers take the Shiites prisoner, grabbing them, throwing some to the ground. Troy looks over his shoulder at this as Imam's daughter is ripped from his arms and he is thrown to the ground and dragged.
TROY: He collapses to one knee.
TROY: Captain Van Meter leans down to Troy. He shouts over the Shiites are lined up in a firing squad.
DOC: Troy lies on the ground suffocating. Archie drags the MP holding him as he goes to General Horn.
ARCHIE GATES: attention, don't let him die
GENERAL HORN: We are not involved in the Shiite problem, do you understand me? You are AWOL, you are a fugitive, you are under arrest.
ARCHIE GATES: General Horn walks away as MPS stare at Troy on the ground, A US SOLDIER stares upset by what's happening, reaches in his pocket, pulls out a hunting knife, pops the blade, crouches down to Troy, exchanges a look with the MP standing by, and cuts Troy's plastic cuffs. Troy reaches with difficulty to the valve on his chest turns it and breathes. Archie looks at Troy, then up at the border. Imam and the Shiites are lined up in a firing squad. Vig's body is dropped in the sand.
ARCHIE GATES: GENERAL HORN ARCHIE GATES GENERAL HORN
GENERAL HORN: ARCHIE GATES GENERAL HORN
ARCHIE GATES: GENERAL HORN
GENERAL HORN: Archie pulls away from the MPs holding him and runs toward the lead truck where MPs grab and wrestle him down.
ARCHIE GATES: GENERAL HORN
GENERAL HORN: An MP jumps into the truck, pushes the barrel over; 30 gold bars spill to the sand. The General looks at the gold. Troy and Doc, held in custody, watch. The General makes a 'CUT' signal to the choppers and the chopper engines cut off and whir down; it grows QUIET. THE U.S. Soldiers holding Walter and the Drivers in custody stand and watch Archie.
GENERAL HORN: How much do you have?
ARCHIE GATES: 4 tons.
GENERAL HORN: Where's it at?
TROY: Get them over first.
ARCHIE GATES: They helped us get it, Ron. I made a deal, and that's soldier's honor. You can't fuck them now.
ARCHIE GATES: You can return this gold, be a big hero, get another star maybe. Let's go, Doug.
GENERAL HORN: Let's go, Doug.
GENERAL HORN: Who's in charge here?
GENERAL HORN: We have to talk about this
BILL SMITHSON: In a morbid tableau these men have recovered some of the gold bullion stolen from Kuwait
CATHY DAITCH: in violation of American policy, saved over a hundred Shiite refugees while recovering stolen Kuwaiti gold
GENERAL HORN: He walks up and forcibly pushes the camera to the ground, Van Meter pushes Cathy's camera down.
BILL SMITHSON: That's a 75 thousand dollar What the fuck are they doing here?
GENERAL HORN: What the fuck are they doing here?
SARGEANT: I thought they were authorized
GENERAL HORN: They are not fucking authorized, for Christ's sake
GENERAL HORN: Haven't I taken care of you,
CATHY DAITCH: I'm gonna get that tape back.
GENERAL HORN: You are under arrest. You are going to be court-martialed. And you will show us where the bullion is right now.
SOLDIER #10: Then another Soldier joins in, WHISTLING and CLAPPING. Then another soldier, until all twenty U.S. Soldiers and MPs present are whistling and cheering Troy, Archie, and Doc as they stand there while the choppers throb. 50 yards away: Imam holds his daughter, on the Iran side, about to get into a Red Crescent bus. Imam and his daughter wave. Archie raises his handcuffed wrists to wave back; Troy and Doc follow, raising their cuffed hands to wave. Freeze frame. "I Get Around" by the Beach Boys KICKS ON.
