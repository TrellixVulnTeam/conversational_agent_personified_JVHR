TAKE SHELTER: Written by Jeff Nichols
CURTIS: ( takes a seat ) No, no, no.Don't feed the dog Hannah immediately picks the piece of toast back up and feeds it to the dog. Samantha brings the pan over and spoons eggs out on everyone's plates.
SAMANTHA: You slept late.
CURTIS: Yeah. I need to go. What you got going today?
SAMANTHA: I've got to finish up some curtains for Saturday, and Nat and Cam are coming over.
CURTIS: ( MOUTH FULL )
SAMANTHA: Yeah. Cammie said she just needed to get out of the house. Samantha takes her seat at the table.
CURTIS: Tell Nat to take it easy on her. Curtis gets up and goes to Hannah.
SAMANTHA: Cam can hold her own. We need to send in the deposit for the beach He kneels beside his daughter's chair and waits for her to make eye contact. She looks over at him. He speaks using sign language. Three broad, slow gestures.
CURTIS: ( SIGNING )
SAMANTHA: Okay. Bye. Samantha sips her coffee as Hannah feeds more toast to the ( as she signs ) No more food. You, eat.
CURTIS: Yeah, let's keep going with that bit! It'll go another 10 feet! He yells to DEWART( 36 ), a big guy sitting at the controls of a diesel powered WELL-DRILLING RIG. The truck has a long rusted bed with metal scaffolding raised HIGH on its back.
DEWART: We won't get the gravel pack down Why not?!
CURTIS: Why not?!
DEWART: Those clouds! We're gonna have to call it! Curtis looks back to a potential STORM. Gray clouds forming across the horizon.
CURTIS: Happy hour starts at five Dewart!
DEWART: ( TO HIMSELF )
CURTIS: Oh, yeah.
NAT: They were just drinkin' and laughin' and oh, my god.it was like I was bein' in a museum and I saw the progress from apes to men. I saw it. I saw the future. Dewart, that was him.that was going to be him in 20 years.
SAMANTHA: Oh my god. Cammie laughs.
NAT: Let me tell you, you laugh. You laugh. But this little one in your arms is gonna be shufflin' in a bar just like `em. Yep.
SAMANTHA: You guys okay?
SUE: Samantha takes a wide line around Hannah, who continues banging the two-by-four into the ground. As soon as the child sees her mother, she stops. Samantha crouches in front of Hannah, gently taking the board away from her. Samantha signs with her hand and speaks at the same time.
SAMANTHA: No. Don't touch. Hannah tilts her head, looking off to the side. Samantha touches her chin bringing her eyes back around.
DEWART: What? It's not my fault! I told Yeah. All right.All right! I'm callin' it! Shut it down! Dewart gladly eases back on the lever at his knee.
CURTIS: Yeah. All right.All right! I'm callin' it! Shut it down! Dewart gladly eases back on the lever at his knee.
SAMANTHA: Bye guys. Thanks for coming over.
NAT: I'll call next week about the Lions Club supper.
SAMANTHA: Okay. Love you.
CAMMIE: Bye Sam.
SAMANTHA: Bye Cam. Running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat. Samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house. The rain outside is the only noise. She heads to the kitchen.
CURTIS: I gotta get home.
DEWART: Nat and me been lookin' into a threesome. We've been chattin' with a girl online from Canton. Yeah. Big `ol girl.
CURTIS: What's big?
DEWART: She's about two fifty, two seventy five. She can't be no taller than 5 foot. Dewart starts laughing, which makes Curtis laugh.
CURTIS: Shit man. The laughing subsides.
DEWART: No. I don't guess you would. Dewart is staring at Curtis.
CURTIS: Well. It ain't always so easy.
DEWART: Hell I know that. Dewart sees something out his window.
CURTIS: Good night. Nat, in a house robe and slippers, weaves her way through the maze of junk on their front lawn. Dewart passes her without saying a word. Curtis watches as she follows him inside the house, still talking. He shifts into drive and pulls away.
CURTIS: ( SOFTLY )
SAMANTHA: She was fine. She's still not playin' with the others, though. She can't connect. Honey, you gotta clean up that trash pile in the back. She fished out a board that had nails on it.
CURTIS: I'll get to it this weekend. It's quiet for a moment.
SAMANTHA: I still whisper. He pulls her tight. They stand together in the doorway. The house is silent.
SAMANTHA: Did you hear me? You got to be home, showered, ready to walk out the door by six tonight. Curtis stands up and goes over to Hannah. He grabs her off the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying.
CURTIS: Did you hear me? You got to be home, showered, ready to walk out the door by six tonight. Curtis stands up and goes over to Hannah. He grabs her off the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying.
SAMANTHA: Did you hear me? You got to be home, showered, ready to walk out the door by six tonight. Curtis stands up and goes over to Hannah. He grabs her off the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying.
CURTIS: Nothing. I just want her to eat her breakfast and stop playin' with the damn dog.
SAMANTHA: She's fine down there. She had toast already. Curtis, against flailing, manages to get Hannah in her chair. Curtis backs off, frustrated. Hannah climbs down from her chair and goes back to the floor and the dog.
CURTIS: Hannah. Come here. Hannah.
SAMANTHA: He stops and checks his watch.
CURTIS: He stops and checks his watch.
SAMANTHA: You didn't eat anything? Heading out.
CURTIS: It's okay. Curtis is gone. Samantha looks at Hannah on the floor with the dog.
JIM: I didn't say you had control over the weather Russell, what I did say was that the top shelf has to be cleared by the 15th. That's non- Dewart eats from a bag of Sunflower seeds. Curtis stares down at his forearm. He rubs the skin there. Jim runs a finger down his clipboard.
CURTIS: Yesterday slowed us down. We couldn't get the second pilot hole Jim drops his head and the clipboard falls to his side. A melodramatic move.
JIM: It rained for two hours yesterday. Two hours and our entire schedule went in the toilet. We lose the permit if you're not out of there by end of day.
CURTIS: Yes sir.
JIM: End of day Curtis. Curtis nods.
CURTIS: Hey, I gotta make a stop before we head out there.
DEWART: Think we got time?
CURTIS: Yeah. There's time.
CURTIS: Dewart jumps down from the control panel to take a look.
DEWART: We stripped that bit.
CURTIS: Yeah. Well, bring it up. We gotta re-set it. Dewart walks back to his controls. Curtis heads to the cab of the drilling rig and checks his watch.
DEWART: Curtis acknowledges Dewart but can't take his eyes off the pattern of birds. They shrink and stretch from thick clumps to long cylindrical tubes. A choreography. Curtis reluctantly heads back to the rig, which is shrieking with the SOUND of metal on metal.
CURTIS: You ever see birds fly like that?!
DEWART: ( holding his hand to his
EAR ): Curtis looks back, giving the birds a final review.
CURTIS: ( TO HIMSELF )
PARKED,: Curtis climbs out and walks to the driveway.
SAMANTHA: Come on we gotta go.
CURTIS: Ah, Jesus. I could really use a Samantha isn't having it. She climbs in the passenger seat. Curtis makes his way to her car.
SAMANTHA: You're not sorry.
CURTIS: I am sorry. She looks to Hannah and signs, "swim".
SAMANTHA: Well, you stink. You smell really He smiles.
CURTIS: I think I smell good. She smiles, begrudgingly, and then signs to Hannah, "Dad" and "stink". Curtis turns to some ladies behind him.
SAMANTHA: INT. CURTIS' TRUCK - DAY Curtis slams the door to his truck, sealing him off from the torrential rainfall outside. He shakes water off, wipes his face. The windows are smeared by thick, dark rain. It's hard to see out. He looks over to Hannah sitting in her car seat. It looks odd on the front bench of the truck. He signs to her.
CURTIS: ( signing and speaking ) You okay? She nods. He cranks the truck and turns on the wipers. The liquid on the windshield streaks into long smudges. Curtis leans forward to get a better view of the street. He checks his blind spot and pulls away.
SHIT!: Curtis stomps on the brakes and turns the wheel. The truck CRASH! Curtis' head busts against the steering column. The front windshield cracks as the truck jerks to a stop. The HISS of a broken radiator. Curtis winces from the blow to his head. Hannah is crying. He reaches over to her.
SAMANTHA: Here honey. Put on your shoes
CURTIS: I've felt better.
SAMANTHA: I guess we could stay home if we need to.
CURTIS: Where you goin'?
SAMANTHA: It's Saturday, I was going to take Hannah to my booth.
CURTIS: Oh. Yeah. Curtis walks to the table and takes a seat.
SAMANTHA: You look really sick honey.
CURTIS: I'm all right. It's just a cold or Let me get you some Advil. She heads for the hallway.
SAMANTHA: Let me get you some Advil. She heads for the hallway.
CURTIS: No. Don't worry about it. Ya'll just go. I'll be fine.
SAMANTHA: You sure?
CURTIS: ( holds up the mug ) Better already. Samantha walks to her purse on the counter and roots through to find a set of keys.
SAMANTHA: Okay. I got my phone if you need anything. Don't forget Sunday lunch is here tomorrow. This reminder makes Curtis rub his face with a grunt.
CURTIS: I'll be all right.
SAMANTHA: Okay, we'll talk later. She heads for the door with Hannah.
CURTIS: Honey, please.
SAMANTHA: Samantha scoops up her bag and takes Hannah by the hand. They leave the room. Curtis notices the dog, Red, sitting on his haunches looking at him. Curtis stares back, sipping his coffee.
BARGAIN HUNTER: How much you asking for this This pillow's fifteen dollars.
SAMANTHA: This pillow's fifteen dollars.
BARGAIN HUNTER: That's more than I want to spend.
SAMANTHA: This is all hand stitched. It takes a really long time. That's why I charge that.
BARGAIN HUNTER: I'll give you seven for it. Samantha looks at the woman, who is almost daring her.
SAMANTHA: I can't go that low.
BARGAIN HUNTER: Well that's my offer. The woman sets down the pillow and begins looking over other items on the table. Samantha bites the inside of her cheek. She doesn't like to haggle.
SAMANTHA: How about 10? The woman doesn't look up.
BARGAIN HUNTER: I'll give you eight, but it's in Samantha forces a smile and motions to Hannah.
SAMANTHA: That's fine. The woman smiles and removes a Ziplock bag of assorted coins from her purse. Hannah takes the bag.
CURTIS: Red! Come on.
NEWS ANCHOR: ( ON TELEVISION )
SAMANTHA: But that's what I don't understand. If he didn't do anything why did you put him out back? Samantha counts out the money earned at the flea market. She sets a portion aside and closes the tackle box. Curtis says something, but it's inaudible.
CURTIS: I just wanted him to be outside for He's your dog. He's always been an inside dog.
SAMANTHA: He's your dog. He's always been an inside dog.
CURTIS: He's my dog, and that's why he's outside. Right now with Hannah and everything I just think it'd be Hannah loves Red.
SAMANTHA: Hannah loves Red.
CURTIS: Hold on. Curtis stares at the television program. Samantha's eyes narrow. Frustrated, she flips open her magazine.
NEWS ANCHOR: .the gas cloud spread across their six acre property.
WALTER JACOBS: ( from a hospital bed ) I tried using some wet rags and towels to breathe through but that just seemed to make it worse.
NEWS ANCHOR: While rescue workers made several attempts to reach the family, Walter Jacobs' wife and brother-in- law died in the home. Jacobs survived despite enduring eleven hours of exposure to the gas cloud before finally being flown out by You hearin' this? Her nose still in the magazine.
CURTIS: You hearin' this? Her nose still in the magazine.
SAMANTHA: It's awful.
CURTIS: Eleven hours. No way out. Samantha shakes her head. Curtis watches the footage of Walter Jacobs. He watches his red rimmed eyes. The deep lines in his face.
CURTIS: Hannah doesn't move. She continues staring out the window. The SOUND of the storm outside intensifies. Windows begin to rattle in their frames. Curtis walks over and reaches for Hannah but is startled by the sight of a MAN'S FACE just outside the window. Hannah and the Man have been staring at one another. The Man, hollow eyed and pale, moves out of the window and out of sight.
CURTIS: You got the number for Dr. Shannan? She turns.
SAMANTHA: You got the number for Dr. Shannan? She turns.
CURTIS: You got the number for Dr. Shannan? She turns.

SAMANTHA: What is that?
CURTIS: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just I got a sore throat. I'm sorry I'm taking it out on you.

CURTIS: It's fine. I'll be fine.
SAMANTHA: No. She needs breakfast.
CURTIS: ( STERN )
SAMANTHA: I'm sorry that you feel bad but you need to drop the attitude.
CURTIS: Come on. Just go.
SAMANTHA: What's wrong with you?
CURTIS: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just go.
SAMANTHA: Hannah's in the den. We have cereal for her. Samantha stomps out of the room. Curtis sighs. He halfway lifts the sheet then lets it fall again.
CURTIS: We're going out. Confused, she slices her finger down an open palm.
CURTIS: You stay put okay? Hannah begins looking through the book. Curtis stands, he sees a set of computers under a sign reading, "CATALOGUE".
SAMANTHA: Let's just start.
MELVIN: Let's all join hands for the The SOUND of the front door opening. Samantha gets up and leaves the room.
SAMANTHA: Where the hell have you been?
CURTIS: I know. I'm sorry. I had to run an You're really late.
SAMANTHA: You're really late.
CURTIS: I know.
SAMANTHA: You didn't even bring your cell Samantha heads back to the dining room. Curtis sucks his INT. LAFORCHE HOME/DINING ROOM - LATER Potatoes dalloped, chicken passed, the table is active with the family serving and eating. Curtis watches it all, somehow separated from it. He's exhausted.
MELVIN: Missed you at church this mornin' He knows what to do if he wants me to stop askin'. Curtis looks at him.
SAMANTHA: He knows what to do if he wants me to stop askin'. Curtis looks at him.
MELVIN: He knows what to do if he wants me to stop askin'. Curtis looks at him.
CURTIS: Was it a good service?
MELVIN: It was. It was good work. Curtis nods. The family in front of him eats the meal.
CURTIS: I'm thinking about cleaning up that storm shelter out back. They look at him.
NURSE: Curtis stands and follows the nurse out of the room.
DOCTOR SHANNAN: Curtis, how you doin' bud?
CURTIS: Hey Doc.
DOCTOR SHANNAN: How's my girl?
CURTIS: She's good.
DOCTOR SHANNAN: That's good to hear. Tilt your head back for me. The Doctor shines the otoscope into his nostrils.
CURTIS: I don't have a cold. The Doctor pauses and turns to check a chart on the table.
DOCTOR SHANNAN: Oh. Did she get that down wrong?
CURTIS: No, I just told her that.
DOCTOR SHANNAN: Oh. So what's the problem?
CURTIS: I've been havin'.I've been having some trouble sleepin'. I was hopin' you could give me somethin' for it. Doctor Shannan takes a seat on a rolling stool and processes the request.
DOCTOR SHANNAN: How long's this been goin' on?
CURTIS: `Bout four nights now.
DOCTOR SHANNAN: You're not sleepin' at all?
CURTIS: Well some, but real restless.
DOCTOR SHANNAN: Well, I think four nights is a little too soon to tell. My advice would be to not eat or drink anything after 8 o'clock at night. Cut back on any alcoholic drinks, tobacco, caffeine.get some daily Well, I think. Curtis isn't sure how much he wants to say.
CURTIS: Well, I think. Curtis isn't sure how much he wants to say.

CURTIS: ( STILL RELUCTANT )
DOCTOR SHANNAN: You urinated in your bed?
CURTIS: Yeah. Couple days before that I had a dream that my dog attacked me and it took all day for the pain in my arm to go away. Doctor Shannan leans his back against the table and thinks about this.
DOCTOR SHANNAN: You been to see your mother lately? He swivels the stool around and writes on a prescription pad.
CURTIS: It's been about a month. He tears two sheets off and holds the first out to Curtis.
DOCTOR SHANNAN: Okay. This is a prescription for a pretty mild sedative. It's non- habit forming, but I'm only giving you enough for a few days anyway. Take it and see if it helps. In the meantime, ( holds up the other slip ) This is the number of a good friend of mine in Columbus. He's a psychiatrist. It's a drive, but he's the best I know.
CURTIS: DOCTOR SHANNAN
DOCTOR SHANNAN: I'll give him a call and let him know you'll be down to see him.
CURTIS: All right.
CURTIS: Hey Dewart!
DEWART: ( HALF TURNING )

GROCERY STORE PHARMACY - DAY Curtis stands in line at the pharmacy located in the back corner of the grocery store. He approaches the counter and hands over his prescription to a female PHARMACIST. She disappears behind a divider as Curtis removes his wallet. He takes out an insurance card and runs his thumb over the The Pharmacist returns with a stapled white bag. Curtis holds out the insurance card.
PHARMACIST: That's okay. We have your insurance on file. That'll be

CURTIS: I love you too.
SAMANTHA: I have good news.
SAMANTHA: Green? How `bout a red? She pretends to use the crayon as lipstick.
CURTIS: It's great. It's great.
SAMANTHA: Like this. Samantha shows him the sign. Curtis mimics.
CURTIS: Excited. Yeah? Hannah nods. He kisses her on the forehead. He picks up a crayon and holds it up to her lips like lipstick.
SAMANTHA: Oh, honey. Look at this one. It's a 2-1 and it sits directly on the beach. Wouldn't that be great? We wouldn't have to worry about Hannah crossing traffic. Curtis walks over and leans in to see the page. They are rental photos of beach condos.
CURTIS: What's the rent?
SAMANTHA: Eight ninety nine a week.
CURTIS: That sounds real nice. Samantha keeps flipping through the magazine as Curtis heads to the bathroom.
SAMANTHA: You sleep well?

CURTIS: Did you ever have any dreams? Like bad dreams.
SARAH: No. Nothing like that. There was ( searches for the words ) There was always a panic that took hold of me. I thought people were watching me or listening to me.
CURTIS: It's all right. It's all right. It's fine. Sarah looks up and smiles. Her focus shifts back to her son.
SARAH: Are you okay?

SAMANTHA: Come to bed.
CURTIS: I will in a bit. Curtis finishes emptying his pockets.
MYERS: Well you've kept up with the payments on the house.
CURTIS: We've been good about that. Myers nods, but he carries a look of concern. He confides.
MYERS: I gotta tell you Curtis, banks aren't loaning money the way they used to. We've got you a loan today, but the interest rates are variable and we have to tie it to your house.
CURTIS: That's fine. Myers sits back, drawing the pen to his lips and tapping it.
MYERS: Curtis, I've known you a long time. We financed your house for you, two vehicles. I'm telling you this is a risky loan you're taking.
CURTIS: I need the money John. Myers nods, then leans forward and clicks the pen.

KENDRA: So tell me `bout these dreams. Curtis studies her face, bites at the inside of his cheek.
SAMANTHA: I don't know what our schedule will be, but.
TEACHER: That's all right. But I really do think you should continue with the sign language. And any additional therapies that kids need for the cochlear implant.
SAMANTHA: Okay. Good night.
TEACHER: Okay. Good night.
SAMANTHA: Good night. As Samantha talks to the Teacher, Curtis looks over flashcards with Hannah. He signs "SUNSHINE", a circle in the sky with the hand then coming down, fingers spread.
CURTIS: ( TO HIMSELF )
CURTIS: Hey. It's all right. Calm down. Samantha takes Hannah into the house without saying a word.
SAMANTHA: Are you out of your mind? She continues into the house. Curtis turns, frustrated. Dewart takes this in, then goes back to his nails.
SAMANTHA: Not a word. You didn't say one word about this to me. Don't you think you owe me that? Don't you think that you might respect me enough to at least consider what I had to say?
CURTIS: I didn't want you worryin' about Well I'm worried Curtis. How are you paying for all that?
SAMANTHA: Well I'm worried Curtis. How are you paying for all that?
CURTIS: I got a home improvement loan from the bank. Samantha is stunned. She stands and gets in his face.
SAMANTHA: How could you do that without talking to me? You know the expenses we have comin' up. You want to waste money on a stupid tornado shelter?
CURTIS: I'm doin' it.I'm doin' it for us. I know you don't understand.
SAMANTHA: You're right. I don't understand. I don't understand half the stuff you've been doin' lately. I don't understand you puttin' Red out back. I don't understand you stayin' up all night in that stupid tornado shelter. You don't come to bed half the time. You leave and don't tell me where you're goin'. Explain that to me. Please. Tell me something that helps me understand why you're bein' like Curtis can't look at her. He tries to find words but fails.
CURTIS: There's nothin' to explain. Samantha stares at his face, searching for an answer. She's on the verge of tears.
SAMANTHA: She touches his arms. A small amount of BLOOD begins to trickle from both sides of his mouth.
CURTIS: ( into the phone ) No. It's fine. It's fine. Don't send an ambulance. It's fine. Curtis clicks off the phone.
SAMANTHA: What are you doing? Curtis wraps his arms around her. He holds her tight. The SOUND of ambulance sirens approach from the distance. Samantha speaks, her voice trembling.
CURTIS: I'm sorry you fellows had to come all the way out.
EMT: It's what we do. Now we can still take you in if you want a doctor to look at those cuts in your mouth.
CURTIS: Yeah. That's all right.. I'll see somebody on Monday.
EMT: All right.
CURTIS: Curtis shakes their hands. He turns to walk back in the house and notices NEIGHBORS watching from their porches.
CURTIS: I haven't been honest with you. I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA: What's goin' on?
CURTIS: I've been havin' these dreams. I guess they're more like nightmares. It's why I've been actin' like Samantha listens with a furrowed brow.
SAMANTHA: That's why you put him out back?
CURTIS: What was the dream? Tonight.
SAMANTHA: What was the dream? Tonight.
CURTIS: It was Dewart. We were at the job site. The storm started and somethin' happened. His face. His eyes were different. He came after me with a pick ax. And we fought. And he ran it through my leg. Curtis zones out for a moment. Samantha says nothing.
ATTENDANT: Since the doctor's approved her for surgery, We just need to get her scheduled. The next possible opening is. ( reviews a calendar ) The 21st of next month. That's six Six weeks?
CURTIS: Six weeks?
ATTENDANT: Is that okay?
SAMANTHA: It's wonderful.
RUSSELL: .this point just to the west. I don't think we'll have any problem. We should be able to get twenty, maybe thirty in this next week. But we're looking to see how that's gonna shape up, so. Dewart smiles and makes broad gestures with his arms. He's telling a story to Dave, who laughs hard.
CURTIS: What do you think?
RUSSELL: What do you think?
CURTIS: Yeah. That sounds good. We'll get it done. Russell rolls up the charts. They walk toward the work site, toward Dewart.
JIM: Come in. Curtis walks inside. He stands in front of the desk.
CURTIS: I need a favor Jim.
JIM: What's that?
CURTIS: Can you take Dewart off my crew? Just reassign him someplace else. Jim sets his pen down and leans back.
JIM: What's the trouble? He not pullin' his weight?
CURTIS: No, nothin' like that. He's a good worker. He's a good man. He's my friend. I think it'd be easier not being in charge of someone I'm so close to. Jim nods.
JIM: You know, I understand. This is part of what it means to manage people Curtis. You're gonna have to learn that.
CURTIS: Yes sir. I appreciate that but. well it would just be very helpful in this case.
JIM: Okay. Well, I can put him with Russell. Anybody else you prefer?
CURTIS: No. Whoever you think's right.
JIM: Thank you. Curtis turns to leave the office.
CURTIS: Thank you. Curtis turns to leave the office.
JIM: You been missin' a lotta work I know. My daughter's had a lot of doctor's visits. I haven't let anything get behind.
CURTIS: I know. My daughter's had a lot of doctor's visits. I haven't let anything get behind.
JIM: No. But don't. Okay.
CURTIS: Curtis shows himself out.
SAMANTHA: I know they just usually do oysters and fries but what if we did something healthier on the side?
NAT: What like slaw? Nat gets up to refill her drink. She looks out the back door and surveys the construction zone. A FORKLIFT lowers the Shipping Container into the giant hole in the backyard. Nat shakes her head.
SAMANTHA: I don't know. Maybe a vegetable or Dewart's been tellin' me how strange Curtis has been actin' lately. I am so sorry. Nat brings her drink back to the table and sits. Samantha doesn't look up from her pad.
NAT: Dewart's been tellin' me how strange Curtis has been actin' lately. I am so sorry. Nat brings her drink back to the table and sits. Samantha doesn't look up from her pad.
SAMANTHA: Things are fine. We're fine. Nat smiles sympathetically.
OWNER: Can I help you?
CURTIS: Yeah. Can I look at one of these gas masks?
OWNER: Sure. Which one you want to look The newest one. The OWNER of the store removes a mask and hands it to him. Curtis fiddles with the mask.
CURTIS: The newest one. The OWNER of the store removes a mask and hands it to him. Curtis fiddles with the mask.
OWNER: One seventy eight. Curtis frowns at the price.
CURTIS: Anything cheaper?
OWNER: No. That's the cheapest one I got in the store. They go all the way up to two ninety. I don't know what you want to spend but a gas mask ain't something you want to go cheap on.
CURTIS: You got any kids sizes?
OWNER: No. Kids can't wear those. They got a have a special thing, its like a hood. I don't fool with those. Curtis nods. The perusing Shopper listens in.

KYLE: How much you spendin' on this It's not bad.
CURTIS: It's not bad.
KYLE: Doesn't look it. Curtis shrugs. Kyle sees his reluctance.
CURTIS: Don't put nothin' on credit cards. That shit'll eat you up.
KYLE: Don't put nothin' on credit cards. That shit'll eat you up.
CURTIS: I'm not. Kyle is staring him down. Curtis just looks at the shelter. There's a long silence shared between them.
KYLE: Samantha called me.
CURTIS: I figured. Curtis climbs back onto the shipping container and continues installing the roof vent.
KYLE: She called `cause she's worried. Says you've been stressed out. Curtis doesn't answer.
CURTIS: So what?
KYLE: You stressed out?
CURTIS: No. No more than anybody else.
KYLE: Work all right?
CURTIS: Uh, huh.Hey, look. You wanna come by and have dinner sometime, Kyle. That's fine. We'll have a beer and talk about the old days, but you got somethin' to say just say it.

CURTIS: No. I've got it. Kyle nods.
KYLE: Okay. Call me if you need me okay?
CURTIS: I will. Kyle looks at him for a moment. He turns and walks toward the driveway.
KYLE: What's that?
CURTIS: You still looking for a dog?
KYLE: Kyle looks at him.
CURTIS: They got a good spot for you, okay Kyle stands at the passenger door to the truck.
KYLE: You sure?

KYLE: I know it'll make my girls happy. All right. Kyle walks around the truck to the driver's side.

KYLE: Kyle stops. Curtis walks up and hugs him. Kyle slaps him on the back.
CURTIS: Take care of yourself.
KYLE: All right. All right. I will little brother. You take care of your family. Handle your business. Curtis nods. Kyle smiles, shaking his head.
CURTIS: All right. Bedtime. Hannah looks up at him. Curtis signs his hand like a pillow then touches his watch. They move out of the bathroom.
SAMANTHA: You okay? She touches his hand. Curtis FLINCHES. Their eyes meet. He wants to take it back, and she can see that. It begins to sink in for her. Hannah vocalizes something behind them. Samantha looks at her husband, shakes her head in disbelief. Hannah makes another sound, pounds on the back door. Samantha turns and sees a MAN standing in their backyard. She flinches.
CURTIS: Ah shit.
CURTIS: Hey Jim.
JIM: Curtis. Dewart told me you took equipment from work for a project at your house. Said that's why you wanted him off your crew. I came out here to see it myself.
CURTIS: Yeah. It was just a hauler and a backhoe. It was Saturday. I had `em back in less than 8 hours.
JIM: You know that doesn't matter. I can't even tell you how many rules you broke.
CURTIS: Well, I'm sorry Jim. I hadn't thought of that. Thank God nothin' like that happened. You know? I'll do whatever I can to make it right.
JIM: You can pick up your last check on Friday. You've got two weeks Curtis nods. Accepts it.
CURTIS: Did you fire Dewart?
JIM: He's on two weeks leave unpaid. I'm sorry Curtis. You did this to Jim turns and walks out of the backyard.
CURTIS: I've been fired. Samantha continues clearing the dishes to the sink. She doesn't look up.
SAMANTHA: What about the health insurance?
CURTIS: We get two more weeks. Samantha slams the plates into the sink. They break. She holds her head back and stares at the ceiling. She walks over to Curtis.
CURTIS: Oh, `scuse me. Andy rises from his chair.
ANDY: Are you Curtis?
CURTIS: Come in. Kendra transferred out. I'll be meeting with you today. Curtis looks at the man. He's kind of mincing.
ANDY: Come in. Kendra transferred out. I'll be meeting with you today. Curtis looks at the man. He's kind of mincing.
CURTIS: What happened to Kendra?
ANDY: She got into a program at OSU so she'll be transferring near there. I've split her case load with another counselor. It's been kind of crazy around here lately.
CURTIS: So I've looked over your file. It says your mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in her early thirties. Let's start there.
ANDY: So I've looked over your file. It says your mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in her early thirties. Let's start there.
SAMANTHA: I'm so sorry. I completely forgot.
WOMAN: That's okay. Don't worry about it.
SAMANTHA: Here. I hope you like them. Samantha hands over the plastic bag.
WOMAN: Thanks. I brought cash.
SAMANTHA: That's terrific. It's fine.
WOMAN: Oh, it's okay. Thank you. Samantha closes the door.
OUTSIDE,: The shipping container has been covered over with dirt. Two rotating vents spin at either end of the brown mound. Curtis sits on the freshly packed dirt signing with Hannah. He signs something that makes her laugh. Hannah smacks a muddy clump between her hands. Curtis touches her nose, leaving a dirt smudge. Hannah laughs. She touches his face, smudging it.
SAMANTHA: What's that?
CURTIS: That's the alternator from the I was just trying to figure out a way to charge enough batteries to run lights down there. Ah, what the hell? Maybe I'll hook it up to your old exercycle. Samantha almost smiles. Curtis keeps his eyes on the parts.
SAMANTHA: You flinched when I touched your hand this morning.
CURTIS: I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA: I was in one of your dreams? Curtis nods.
CURTIS: Can you deal with that? He holds open his hand to her. She takes it.
SAMANTHA: Can you deal with that? He holds open his hand to her. She takes it.
CURTIS: Okay. Then I made a decision. We cancel the beach trip. We have enough to cover bills for the next two months with your last check. I'm going to get a job. You're gonna find another job. I'm going to call to see if we can move Hannah's surgery up. We'll need to see what it costs to extend your policy to the end of the year. I want you to see a psychiatrist. Not a counselor from the free clinic. Someone good.

CURTIS: Doctor Shannan gave me the number of somebody. But, uh, I just don't think we can afford it.
SAMANTHA: We'll find the money. Also, the Lions Club supper's this weekend. I want you to come with me.
CURTIS: I don't want to see any of those I want you to go. I need to do something normal.
SAMANTHA: I want you to go. I need to do something normal.
CURTIS: All right. Curtis nods. Samantha let's go of his hand and walks back to the house. Curtis goes back to studying the auto parts.
CURTIS: How many pieces does Hannah get?
SAMANTHA: Just one. Curtis uses tongs to grab pieces of fried oyster. Looking up, he can see back through the kitchen to an open door outside. Dewart stands there over a butane fired frying pot. He wears an apron and stares at Curtis. Curtis moves down the line.
DEWART: What're you doin' here?
CURTIS: Not here man. Dewart taps him on the shoulder again.
DEWART: I said what are you doin' here. Curtis stands and Dewart takes a step back. The general noise of the place starts to quiet down as people take notice. A few stand.
SAMANTHA: I told people what you been doin'.
DEWART: I told people what you been doin'.
CURTIS: I know.
DEWART: You cut me loose. Everything we been through.
CURTIS: I know. I'm sorry. Dewart shoves him in the chest.
DEWART: You ain't fucking sorry. You sorry you wouldn't cut me loose. We fuckin' friends! This how you treat friends? Curtis places a hand on Dewart's chest.
CURTIS: Come on. Dewart punches Curtis in the face. It stings.
SAMANTHA: STOP IT DEWART! Curtis stands and kicks Dewart in the knee. It buckles back and he's on the floor. He cries out and grabs the twisted joint. He's done. Curtis paces over him, covered in ketchup and soda. He shouts down at him.
CURTIS: I SAID NOT HERE! GOD DAMNIT! He wipes at his face. Sees all of the people staring at him. Addresses them.
CURTIS: He pulls his head out from the hood and sees Hannah standing on the curb. She looks down the street. He runs down his driveway, wiping his hands on a rag and watching the horizon.
SMASH!: The windshield of a car parked next to him SHATTERS. Curtis looks at the broken glass. A dead bird, it's neck broken, rests crumpled on the hood.
SMACK!: Another bird crashes into the asphalt just in front of him. Then another. Curtis looks up. The Flock of birds are circling overhead and diving down at him. More birds crashing to the ground. Curtis covers his head. The neighborhood's tornado SIRENS begin to sound. Curtis rushes Hannah toward his front door as dozens of birds plummet from the sky. The sirens BLARING.
SAMANTHA: Curtis! Wake up! Wake up! TORNADO SIRENS continue to scream throughout the Curtis looks to the window. Rain and hail are battering the house. He jumps to his feet and grabs Samantha by the arm. They rush out of the room.
CURTIS: Come on. It's okay. Curtis leads them through the entry to the larger section of the shelter. Samantha takes Hannah and sits with her on one of the cots. She's signing to her, trying to calm her down.
SAMANTHA: No. Don't do that.
CURTIS: It's okay. It's oxygen. Here. Put this on. Curtis hands Samantha a gas mask.
SAMANTHA: Are you kidding?
CURTIS: Please just do it. Okay? He looks to Hannah and places an oxygen mask over her face..
SAMANTHA: Wake up babe. Curtis' head moves. He sees that Samantha and Hannah have removed their masks.
CURTIS: Where's your mask?
SAMANTHA: We took them off. It's fine. Take it off.
CURTIS: Curtis hesitates.
SAMANTHA: We're fine. Take it off. Curtis slips the mask off his face. Worried, he takes a You need to open the door now.
CURTIS: ( MUMBLES )
SAMANTHA: What if it's not over?
CURTIS: What if it's not over?
SAMANTHA: It's over. Get the keys. Open the Curtis slowly gets to his feet. He sees the dark entryway to the original section of the shelter. Taking the lantern, he walks to it. Samantha and Hannah follow. Curtis stops just inside. He holds the lantern up, illuminating the padlocked metal doors. He looks back at his family, then climbs the steps. He places his hand on the door. He flinches.
CURTIS: It's still storming.
SAMANTHA: No. It's not.
CURTIS: I can hear it. Samantha stares at him. The room is silent.
SAMANTHA: I don't hear anything.
CURTIS: Put your hand on the door. You can feel it. He takes Samantha's wrist and guides her to the doors. He watches her face as she places a hand against the metal. She looks at him, her eyes getting red, and shakes her head "no". Curtis kneels in front of Hannah and mimics the signs from ( signing and speaking ) Thunder? Do you feel it?
SAMANTHA: Baby, there's no storm outside.
CURTIS: I'm sorry. Samantha walks over to him.
SAMANTHA: Curtis. I wouldn't lie to you. We love you very much. Please open the door. Curtis is on the verge of tears. He slowly reaches into his jeans pocket. He removes the keys. He holds them out to Samantha.
CURTIS: I'm sorry. I can't. Samantha looks at the keys, then at Curtis. Tears shake from his trembling face.
SAMANTHA: I love you, but if I open the door, then nothin's gonna change. You'll see that everything's fine, but nothing will change. Please. This is what it means to stay with us. This is something you have to do. He looks at Hannah, then Samantha. Curtis steadies himself, trying to control his flinching. He wipes his face with the back of his hands and takes a deep breath. Curtis walks toward the doors. On the steps, he reaches up to the padlock. The keys shake in his fingers. He turns to Could you move Hannah back?
CURTIS: Could you move Hannah back?
CURTIS: It's fine. She walks over to Curtis and hugs him. He kisses Samantha on the head. Curtis looks up at the sky.
PSYCHIATRIST: Do you have any vacation time that you could use?
CURTIS: I don't have a job right now.
PSYCHIATRIST: Well, I know that times are hard, but I think it's really important for you to separate yourself from that storm shelter.
SAMANTHA: We usually go on a trip to Myrtle Beach every summer. We were gonns go this month.
PSYCHIATRIST: I think that would be okay if we start the medication now. It would give you all some time to prepare as a family, but I want to be clear, when Curtis gets back he'll need to take more time than that.
SAMANTHA: What does that mean?
PSYCHIATRIST: I mean that he'll need hands on therapy at a real facility. Curtis looks up for the first time.
CURTIS: You mean I have to leave my family.
PSYCHIATRIST: I think you need to seriously commit to some treatment. Curtis processes this. Samantha takes his hand.
CURTIS: ( signing and speaking ) Hey. Good, huh? Hannah sits on her knees in front of Curtis sprinkling dry sand over castle shaped mounds already formed.
CURTIS: Good. We put a top on it. Curtis smooths out the sand in the castle shaped bucket and turns it over to top off their sand mound. He hands the bucket over for Hannah to refill. The SOUND of the waves behind them has STOPPED. They don't Curtis takes two fingers and digs a small trench around the sand castle. Curtis looks up ready to sign the letters but sees Hannah staring at the water. She looks at him and signs something with her hands.
SAMANTHA: THE END.
