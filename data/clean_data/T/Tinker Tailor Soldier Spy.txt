MAGYAR: ( Hungarian, subtitled ) And porkolts. You know porkolts?
JIM PRIDEAUX: ( Hungarian, subtitled ) Yes, I've had it.
MAGYAR: It's very good. Better than goulash. But you won't get it in Budapest now.
JIM PRIDEAUX: Why's that?
MAGYAR: All the pigs have gone to Moscow.
JIM PRIDEAUX: When do I get to meet your
MAGYAR: I'll take you to him. Not eating?
JIM PRIDEAUX: Would you excuse me a moment? No firing!
KGB MAN: No firing!
PERCY ALLELINE: ( Scottish accent ) I wish I could have done more, ( Coolly ) You did all you could, Percy. ( Beat ) Well, a man should know when to leave the party.
CONTROL: ( Coolly ) You did all you could, Percy. ( Beat ) Well, a man should know when to leave the party.
TOBY ESTERHASE: What about Smiley?
CONTROL: Smiley is leaving with me.
BILL HAYDON: You little prick Esterhase.
POLYAKOV: ( In Russian ) Shall we begin?
LACON: ( through glass ) This is private property. Who are
RICKI TARR: Minister Lacon.
LACON: What do you want?
RICKI TARR: I want to talk to Control. And I want breakfast.
PETER GUILLAM: ( of the bike ) Has that been cleared?
BILL HAYDON: I'm not bloody chaining it outside. Mind you, probably no safer in here, with you bunch of
HAYDON: Thought I'd get a glimpse of the new girl. Before Bland gets to her. He seen her yet?
GUILLAM: Oh yes. Down first thing.
HAYDON: You may fuck me, Belinda, but you still have to call me sir in the
PETER GUILLAM: Peter Guillam.
SMILEY: ( Surprised ) Hello, Peter.
SMILEY: Are we going far?
LACON: How's your mother?
PETER GUILLAM: Very well. Is this where he got out?
LACON: Mmm, I came back in and it was wide Do send her my love. Apologies for singling you out, but. very sensitive matter.
PETER GUILLAM: Ricki Tarr, sir. One of my scalp- hunters. He's been on the wanted list for a year. Last job was Istanbul, bit of coat-trailing for a Russian convention.
LACON: Why is he on the wanted list?
PETER GUILLAM: ( beat ) He killed our man in Istanbul. Cut his throat. Been on the run since
LACON: My God. In my own home. my family. The bloody animals you people employ!
LACON: And how are you George? Missing one's work, one's buddies?
SMILEY: Oh, I think I manage pretty well, thank you.
LACON: Your wife, the lovely Ann? She's in the pink, and so on.
SMILEY: Very well. ( Beat ) Very bonny.
LACON: Do you know this man Tarr?
SMILEY: ( Mildly ) I recruited him actually. In Penang. Good with women. Likes to talk. What did he say to you?
LACON: He said he had some intelligence for Control. Had no idea he was dead. The news obviously hadn't reached Wonga Wonga land. Then he said he would only tell it to someone outside the Circus. If he couldn't have a Minister, he would settle for the Under-secretary. Lucky me. He said there's a mole. Right at the top of the Circus. And that he's been there for years.
LACON: I was sad to see you go, George. I thought it was shabby, very shabby.
SMILEY: I am retired, Oliver. Thing is, some time back, when Control was still alive, he came to me with a similar suggestion.
LACON: Thing is, some time back, when Control was still alive, he came to me with a similar suggestion.
SMILEY: I just thought. with you being "his man", so to speak.
LACON: I just thought. with you being "his man", so to speak.
SMILEY: What did you say to him?
LACON: ( Beat ) I'm afraid I thought his paranoia had got the better of him and he was pulling his own house down. That does happen in your business. And that bloody mess in Budapest.
SMILEY: ( Beat ) I'll keep Peter Guillam. And there's a retired special branch man. Mendel. I'd like to have him.
LACON: Yes, yes. Do your own housekeeping. Good man.
SMILEY: No, we never did.
MENDEL: Her real name is plain Graham. Added the Pope for a touch of
SMILEY: Control lived with his sister didn't he?
MENDEL: Basingstoke. Not much of a paper- trail as you can imagine. His pension and she owns a block of bedsits in her own name in West We should.
GUILLAM: We should.
MENDEL: . Webb and Bryson are the letting agents. Properties in half of the west end judging by this list.
SMILEY: We're only looking for short term rentals. Within the last year.
MENDEL: ( Reading from the list ) A Miss Hilliard. L. Cavaleri? D Weaver, M Crowley, M Cushing. F. Farling. G. Hiaasen.
SMILEY: How long was H. Staunton a tenant?
MENDEL: ( Consulting the list ) Still is. Been renting for a few years now. Something?
SMILEY: ( Musing ) Howard Staunton. Control used to say he was England's greatest chess master. Died in eighteen seventy-
TOBY ESTERHASE: Help you with something Bill?
BILL HAYDON: Looking for his Majesty.
TOBY ESTERHASE: ( sullenly ) He's walking the battlements.
BILL HAYDON: ( in Hungarian, subtitled ) Much obliged.
ALLELINE: ( Without turning ) It's the Yanks. They want to come in and talk.
BLAND: It's the Yanks. They want to come in and talk.
ALLELINE: Of course they do. We have Witchcraft. And they don't.
SMILEY: Thank you. Anywhere will do.
MENDEL: ( Wryly ) That enough for you to be getting on with?
SMILEY: ( Beat ) No. Peter, I need you to do something for me.
KASPAR: ( Suspicious ) Sorry Peter, didn't know you were doing. whatever you were
PETER GUILLAM: Trying not to bleed to death. Fawley's got a first aid kit in one of his drawers. Get me a plaster will you?
ROY BLAND: ( without looking at him ) Heard you had an accident.
PETER GUILLAM: Cut it on a drawer handle. ( Beat ) When are we going to get some new furniture round here?
ROY BLAND: I'll have a word with Esterhase, Peter. We'll make it a priority on the top floor.
PETER GUILLAM: ROY BLAND
ROY BLAND: Want some company?
ROY BLAND: Tell you the truth, I'm in no hurry to get back up there.
PETER GUILLAM: Smothered by the Mothers.
ROY BLAND: Something like that. Those old birds, all pining for Control. Percy still can't get a decent cup of tea out of them. Still, I imagine it takes time.
PETER GUILLAM: What does?
ROY BLAND: He takes a pull of his pint.
PETER GUILLAM: ( Quickly )
ROY BLAND: ( Suddenly ) What do you think of Datsuns?
PETER GUILLAM: ROY BLAND
ROY BLAND: Datsuns. Just got one. Wife made me. Hatchback. Caught sight of myself in it, driving past a shop window and I thought to myself "Who's that old fucker?"
PETER GUILLAM: ROY BLAND
ROY BLAND: French? Ooh la la.
PETER GUILLAM: Jerry Westerby, dismissed December 4th. And. Connie Sachs, retired November 28th. That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out.
SMILEY: I know that car.
LACON: On our way to La Bohème. The Minister wondered if there was anything to report?
SMILEY: Not much, I'm afraid. We were just discussing the departure of Connie Sachs. I wonder how Research manages without her.
PETER GUILLAM: Probably relieved. She always struck me as unhinged.
SMILEY: That was one of her talents.
LACON: ( Indicating the chess Looking a little unhinged yourself, George.
SMILEY: ( Distracted )
LACON: ( Unconvinced ) Control lost his position because of that fiasco in Budapest. that poor chap.?
PETER GUILLAM: Jim Prideaux.
SMILEY: Yes. Yes, he did.
LACON: How did you get this? This is Witchcraft material.
SMILEY: Control was out. And Alleline was in. Thanks to.
SMILEY: Return to Oxford please.
"SACHS.": Glancing sideways he is caught, entranced, by the sight of a young couple kissing in the window. They turn, suddenly aware of his presence and Smiley, embarrassed, continues walking round the house.
SMILEY: ( Of the tea ) Oh, I brought.
CONNIE SACHS: ( eyeing it hungrily ) Not supposed to. Doctor's orders.
SMILEY: You left the Circus shortly after I retired.
CONNIE SACHS: I didn't leave. I was dismissed. Chucked out on the rubbish heap. ( Beat ) Like you.
SMILEY: ( Ignoring this )
CONNIE SACHS: "Lost my sense of proportion." That's what that personnel cow said. Wouldn't let go of a bone.
SMILEY: Which bone?
CONNIE SACHS: Smiley nods, a look of boredom settling on his face - A
SMILEY: CONNIE SACHS
CONNIE SACHS: Cultural Attaché Polyakov.
SMILEY: Stationed where?
CONNIE SACHS: Here. London. Turned up in sixty five. And I had a feeling, as soon as I laid eyes on him. But that little swine Toby Esterhase told me I was seeing Spies under the bed.
SMILEY: Esterhase said that?
CONNIE SACHS: He had him graded Persil. Whiter than white. And that was that.
SMILEY: But you disagreed?
CONNIE SACHS: Pretty Polly? Very military bearing for someone who's never supposed to have been in the army. But, he was good. Went to Embassy functions, lectures. I love a man who lives his cover. Never put a foot wrong.
SMILEY: ( Beat )
CONNIE SACHS: ( As if summoning him ) Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly.
PERCY ALLELINE: ( Hard ) You're to leave Polyakov alone. You're becoming obsessed with him.
CONNIE SACHS: Hate the real world. ( Beat ) What does it matter? Old Circus is gone anyway, apart from Bill Haydon. Better off out of it. ( Beat )I know you never liked him.
SMILEY: ( Sharply ) What nonsense. What on earth makes you say that?
CONNIE SACHS: ( Surprised ) I don't know.
SMILEY: ( Chiding ) It was the war, Connie.
CONNIE SACHS: A real war. Englishmen could be proud then.
POLYAKOV: . He says "Father, father, I've just had sex with two 17 year old girls." The Priest says "That's quite a sin, but you're an Atheist, General Secretary."
CONTROL: Step into my lair.
CONTROL: ( To Smiley ) Sit down and take a look at this
SMILEY: ( Engrossed ) Where did you get it?
CONTROL: I didn't. Percy and his little cabal walked in with it.
TOBY ESTERHASE: ( Protesting "cabal" ) Shut up, Esterhase. If it's genuine it's gold-dust. ( Beat ) But its topicality makes it suspect.
CONTROL: Shut up, Esterhase. If it's genuine it's gold-dust. ( Beat ) But its topicality makes it suspect.
SMILEY: If it's genuine it's gold-dust. ( Beat ) But its topicality makes it suspect.
CONTROL: Smiley is suspicious, Percy. Smells a fake.
SMILEY: Where does it come from? What's the access?
CONTROL: Percy doesn't feel like telling.
PERCY ALLELINE: A new secret source of mine.
SMILEY: But how could he possibly have access to.?
PERCY ALLELINE: He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy
SMILEY: ( Faintly ) Percy and his pals have bypassed us, Smiley. Gone straight to the Minister. Everyone's very excited. Percy's to be allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret.
CONTROL: Percy and his pals have bypassed us, Smiley. Gone straight to the Minister. Everyone's very excited. Percy's to be allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret.
PERCY ALLELINE: The Minister agrees with me that too many secrets are blown around here. Too much failure, too many scandals, too little solid
CONTROL: Luckily Percy's cabal has come to save us.
PERCY ALLELINE: ( Bulldozing on ) It's all office politics here.
ROY BLAND: Percy does have a point, Control. We should be fighting communism, not each other.
PERCY ALLELINE: Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners.
CONTROL: Your bloody Yanks!
PERCY ALLELINE: ( Shouting ) And we've had enough! There's going to be changes, Smiley!
TOBY ESTERHASE: We need to decide if we're part of the past, or part of the I should have left you where I found you.
CONTROL: ( Contemptuous ) I should have left you where I found you.
ROY BLAND: Control, if we could all just.
CONTROL: OUT! ALL OF YOU!
SMILEY: ( Cautiously ) If Witchcraft is genuine. I don't trust miracles.
CONTROL: I don't trust miracles.
MENDEL: ( Of the tea ) Courtesy of Mrs P. You been up all night?
SMILEY: Mendel notices one SLIP OF PAPER, sitting alone on the opposite side of the desk.
MENDEL: What's that?
SMILEY: Request for a thousand pound's in cash from the reptile fund.
MENDEL: What for?
SMILEY: For a Mister Ellis.
MENDEL: Who's Ellis?
SMILEY: It was one of Jim Prideaux's work What's so strange about that The date. Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago. October twenty first. So why was
MENDEL: What's so strange about that The date. Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago. October twenty first. So why was
SMILEY: The date. Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago. October twenty first. So why was
PRIDEAUX: Hand those out.
PRIDEAUX: ( After a moment ) Come down here. ( Identifying him ) Boy with the marble.
ROACH: Yes sir.
PRIDEAUX: Gave me a turn up there, parked on the horizon. Thought you were a Juju man. What's your name?
BILL ROACH: Sir, Roach, sir. Bill. I'm a new New arrival, eh? Middle of year? What's the story?
PRIDEAUX: New arrival, eh? Middle of year? What's the story?
BILL ROACH: ( Blushing ) My mother and father. my father's left, so.
PRIDEAUX: Bill? The unpaid Bill. Anyone ever call you that?
BILL ROACH: No sir.
PRIDEAUX: Known a lot of Bills. They've all been good `uns. What you good at?
BILL ROACH: Nothing sir.
PRIDEAUX: You're a good watcher though eh? Us loners always are. No one else spotted me when I turned up here. Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'll bet. Long as he's got his specs on. Right?
BILL ROACH: ( Gratefully ) Yes sir.
PRIDEAUX: Free period, isn't it? Don't waste it down here.
RICKI TARR: Hello Mister Smiley. You remember Hello, Ricki.
SMILEY: Hello, Ricki.
RICKI TARR: Losing my touch.
SMILEY: Where've you been, Ricki?
RICKI TARR: Here, there. Run out of places now. They're gonna kill me.
SMILEY: Who is?
RICKI TARR: Your lot. Or their lot. Whoever gets me first. I'm innocent, by the way. Within reason. ( Beat ) You going to find him then? The
SMILEY: I'm going to try. How long have you been here?
RICKI TARR: Few days. Needed somewhere to
SMILEY: I wouldn't use my home as a safe house. There's every chance they're watching it.
RICKI TARR: Calculated risk Mister Smiley. I wanted to see you, figured you'd turn up here sooner or later.
SMILEY: What do you want Ricki?
RICKI TARR: There's a woman. I want you to trade for her. Get her back from What woman?
SMILEY: What woman?
RICKI TARR: Her name's Irina.
TUFTY THESINGER: ( grinning ) This is going to be a long night.
RICKI TARR: You baby-sit this one.
RICKI TARR: Your bloke's a bit of a bastard. ( Beat ) Just wanted to check you were alright.
SMILEY: You were due to fly home the next day. What did you tell London?
RICKI TARR: Nothing. Didn't have anything to tell yet. But. I could sense it in her.
SMILEY: Sense what?
RICKI TARR: A secret.
IRINA: I know what you are.
SMILEY: What made you so sure she wasn't We've all got our strengths. And Me, I know women. She said she had a secret. The mother of all secrets. Said she'd only tell Control. She wanted to trade. New life for her and her kids.
RICKI TARR: We've all got our strengths. And Me, I know women. She said she had a secret. The mother of all secrets. Said she'd only tell Control. She wanted to trade. New life for her and her kids.
SMILEY: She had children in Russia?
RICKI TARR: That's why they let her and Boris out. So, I said I'd tell the But you didn't?
SMILEY: ( Beat ) But you didn't?
IRINA: If I tell you, I'm putting my life in your hands. The lives of my children? Do you understand?
IRINA: ( tenderly ) Promise me you'll be careful. No details to the Circus. Not until we're safe.
RICKI TARR: ( genuine ) I promise.
TUFTY THESINGER: You were supposed to have gone. London stations's been on to me. They want to know what the hell you're doing.
RICKI TARR: ( without turning ) Fuck off.
SMILEY: And what did your message say, Just that I had a Moscow Centre trained hood wanting to defect.
RICKI TARR: Just that I had a Moscow Centre trained hood wanting to defect.
SMILEY: What else?
RICKI TARR: I know what I am to the Circus. One of the scalp-hunters. Someone to give the dirty jobs to. I wanted to bring this one in Yes. I quite see that.
SMILEY: Yes. I quite see that.
RICKI TARR: I said that she claimed to have information crucial to the well- being of the Circus.
RICKI TARR: That she had information concerning a Double Agent.
SMILEY: What happened next Ricki?
RICKI TARR: I waited for a reply.
BATHROOM: Irina is backing out of the room. We catch a glimpse of the BUTCHERED REMAINS of BORIS hanging from the shower rail, a garroting wire around his neck. He's been tortured, the shower curtain used to catch the pooling blood. She BACKS AWAY across the room to the door, leaving a trail of bloody footprints on the pale carpet. She turns to the door, looks out of the SPY HOLE. Her P.O.V. - two men, TINY DISTORTED FIGURES walking down the corridor towards her. The phone starts to RING. Irina glances at it, knowing it's too late for her. SPY-HOLE - The TWO FIGURES loom closer.
RICKI TARR: They put her on a ship. That's all I know. I've done a lot of things Mister Smiley, but. I don't know why. I keep thinking about her. ( Beat )
SMILEY: Where are you going Ricki? You said yourself, Karla will be looking for you. I can take you somewhere. Keep you safe.
RICKI TARR: Who's going to keep you safe?
OLIVER LACON: Percy has always resisted suggestions of wider exploitation of Witchcraft's intelligence.
MINISTER: Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.
PERCY ALLELINE: I've refused to share Witchcraft with our allies, so far, Greedy boy.
MINISTER: Greedy boy.
PERCY ALLELINE: My goal has been to establish his track record beyond all doubt. I think the time has come to approach our American brothers-in-
MINISTER: You think they'll take us back into bed?
PERCY ALLELINE: I'm not interested in a one-off trade. I want on-going access to American intelligence.
MINISTER: Do you think we can get it?
PERCY ALLELINE: With Witchcraft on our side, I think we can get anything we bloody-well want.
CONTROL: Percy. Did you do this?
PERCY ALLELINE: I followed the recipe.
CONTROL: Smiley? Where's Ann? Get me a lady of taste? Ann will sort it I'll go find her. - ROY BLAND with his plain wife, eyeing one of the pretty
SMILEY: ( grateful to get away I'll go find her.
REVERSE: Two shapes locked in an embrace. Smiley stands, nakedly absorbing the body blow. Then he turns and walks back to the heat and noise of the party.
PETER GUILLAM: You look tired.
SMILEY: Yes. I didn't sleep well. ( Beat ) I want you to get something for me, Peter. I need the duty officer's log book for last November. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to send you up a floor, into the Lion's den. ( Beat ) If you have the slightest Is feeling sick to your stomach a slight reservation?
PETER GUILLAM: Is feeling sick to your stomach a slight reservation?
SMILEY: If you're caught, Peter, you can't mention me. I'm sorry, but you're alone.
MENDEL: You're clean. Nothing on your back. Nothing on your conscience.
BRYANT: Mister Guillam? How's the family?
PETER GUILLAM: Fine, Bryant. Up to Registry Okay sir. Yellow one for the bag
BRYANT: Okay sir. Yellow one for the bag
PETER GUILLAM: Time you oiled this thing, isn't We keep asking.
PETER GUILLAM: You're kidding?
JANITOR PETE: New rules.
PETER GUILLAM: Mind the jewels.
JANITOR PETE: Pen and watch sir.
PETER GUILLAM: You don't look pleased to see me, Why would I be? You bloody
BILL HAYDON: Why would I be? You bloody
PETER GUILLAM: Doing some research. Makes a change from sitting on my arse.
BILL HAYDON: Heard it was quiet down there.
PETER GUILLAM: As the grave. When're you going to give us something to do?
BILL HAYDON: Haven't you heard? Technology's the future. No need for you apes anymore. I can get you a posting to Northern Ireland if that helps get the blood racing.
PETER GUILLAM: Thanks anyway. Stick to sitting on my arse.
JANITOR ALWYN: ( re: Guillam's bag ) Want me to look after that for you, Mister Guillam?
PETER GUILLAM: JANITOR ALWYN
JANITOR ALWYN: Gotta give you a chit. The Dolphin'll kill me if I don't. New Rules.
PETER GUILLAM: So, chit me.
SAL: What you up to this weekend?
PETER GUILLAM: ( rakish ) Visiting aunts.
SAL: I'll bet.
JANITOR ALWYN: ( To Guillam ) Telephone sir.
PETER GUILLAM: ( as though distracted ) Oh to hell, who is it?
JANITOR ALWYN: Outside line, sir. Someone rough. The garage, I think, regarding your car.
PETER GUILLAM: ( into the phone ) Hello? ( Beat ) Well, damn. Can't you do the bloody repair?
MENDEL: Can't be done sir, you're going to need a new gear box.
PETER GUILLAM: At least get on to the main dealers first.
PETER GUILLAM: Well, hold on.
TOBY ESTERHASE: Could we see you Peter?
PETER GUILLAM: Of course.
JANITOR ALWYN: Will do sir.
TOBY ESTERHASE: The Chief will take no calls, please, ladies.
MOTHER: ( Muttering ) We can hear.
TOBY ESTERHASE: We are having a conference.
PERCY ALLELINE: ( Reading ) Well now young Peter Guillam, are you ready for me finally?
PETER GUILLAM: Couple of Arab ploys look quite promising. Other than that, getting quite good at ping-pong.
PERCY ALLELINE: Arabs. You can rent one but you can't buy one. Right Bill?
PETER GUILLAM: ( Not missing a beat ) Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's every afternoon.
PERCY ALLELINE: I require the matter of your discussion with Tarr.
PETER GUILLAM: I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.
PERCY ALLELINE: ( Quietly ) What's that shrug for? PERCY ALLELINE ( CONT'D )
PETER GUILLAM: But I haven't been seeing him! So get your facts straight and get
PERCY ALLELINE: So if I told you that Tarr had recently arrived in Paris would you be surprised?
PETER GUILLAM: Nothing would surprise me about And if I told you we happen to know that thirty thousand pounds mysteriously appeared in his bank account last month, would that surprise you?
PERCY ALLELINE: And if I told you we happen to know that thirty thousand pounds mysteriously appeared in his bank account last month, would that surprise you?
PETER GUILLAM: What for?
PERCY ALLELINE: Never mind what for! To muddy the water, that's what for! Spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails! The point is this - he's heading for home. The first peep from him you come to the grown-ups, understood? Anyone you see at this table. But not another damn soul!
MECHANIC: ( German, subtitled ) He's waiting for you.
MENDEL: ( A faint smile ) All go smoothly did it? ( Beat ) Where we off to?
PETER GUILLAM: The hotel. I have to see George.
MENDEL: Mister Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir. Change of venue.
TARR: Hello, Mister Guillam, sorry I took so long to come back.
FAWN: Excuse me, sir.
SMILEY: Ricki's been helping us Peter. ( Indicating TAPE DECK ) He's been telling us all about his He's a double, George! There is no Mole! The whole thing's a pack of lies thought up by Moscow. Karla's bought him for thirty thousand pounds!
PETER GUILLAM: ( To Smiley ) He's a double, George! There is no Mole! The whole thing's a pack of lies thought up by Moscow. Karla's bought him for thirty thousand pounds!
SMILEY: As you did take the trouble to steal it. Ricki, you said you sent the Circus a telegram concerning Irina's information?
RICKI TARR: ( Sullenly ) What was the date?
SMILEY: What was the date?
PETER GUILLAM: He doesn't know because there was no telegram! The whole thing.
RICKI TARR: November 20th. It would have been November 20th. Evening.
SMILEY: November 20th is missing. ( Beat ) Someone is covering their tracks Peter. Unless you think that's just a coincidence?
PETER GUILLAM: What about the money?
SMILEY: Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole. I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him.
PETER GUILLAM: ( Reading ) "Enquiries to the fifth floor."
SMILEY: You recognize that handwriting? ( Beat ) That's Toby Esterhase.
PETER GUILLAM: Why didn't you tell me? That you had Tarr?
SMILEY: Secrecy is a habit.
PETER GUILLAM: I should get some rest. And I suppose you should get your reading done.
PETER GUILLAM: I'm sorry.
SMILEY: What for?
PETER GUILLAM: I wanted to believe Tarr was lying. ( Beat ) All this time, thinking I'm fighting a war. It's a sham. Karla won years ago and we didn't even know it.
SMILEY: ( Beat ) I met him once. Karla.
PETER GUILLAM: ( Beat ) What did he say?
SMILEY: ( To the chair ) Think of your wife. You have a wife, don't you? I brought you some cigarettes, by the way.
PETER GUILLAM: That was Karla? And he flew back to die rather than give in?
SMILEY: Yes. ( Beat ) And that's how I know he can be beaten. Because he's a fanatic. And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.
PETER GUILLAM: What did he look like?
SMILEY: That's the thing. ( Beat ) I can't
RICHARD: ( without looking up ) Nearly done.
ROACH: ( Braking ) Time sir?
PRIDEAUX: ( Quietly ) Got your specs on Jumbo?
ROACH: Yes, sir.
PRIDEAUX: Who's the fellow down there?
ROACH: ( Disappointed ) Don't know sir.
PRIDEAUX: Who is he? Beggarman? Thief? Why doesn't he look this way?
CLASS: ( By rote ) Best car in England!
BELINDA: Stop it! Stop it!
KASPAR: Keep your bloody hands off her! Christ's sake, don't fight over a bit of skirt!
SCALPHUNTER: Christ's sake, don't fight over a bit of skirt!
JERRY WESTERBY: But that's the way it is, George, isn't it? When you're out, you're out. Too much of this stuff.
SMILEY: ( Obliging ) How. ( Beat ) I need to talk to you about the night Jim Prideaux was killed, Jerry. You were duty officer, weren't you?
JERRY WESTERBY: Yes. Control asked me to man the phones that night. Said someone was doing a special job for the service. He wanted someone from outside he could trust. If anything came in, I was to tell him and only
JERRY WESTERBY: ( Entering ) Been a bit of a panic, sir.
JERRY WESTERBY: Ann? I'm sorry to bother you. Is George back yet?
SMILEY: You rang my house?
JERRY WESTERBY: Just on the off chance you were back from Berlin.
SMILEY: What did you say?
JERRY WESTERBY: Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis. She said you weren't back yet. That was it.
SMILEY: Go on.
JERRY WESTERBY: All hell broke loose - military yelling about Hungarian tank movements on the border, Lacon and the Minister baying at the door. Thank Christ Bill Haydon turned up when he did.
BILL HAYDON: Get out.
JERRY WESTERBY: I tried to get hold of you.
BILL HAYDON: I just picked up half a story on the ticker-tape at my club. Tell me.
JERRY WESTERBY: Jim Prideaux's been shot.
HAYDON: Get me the Hungarian Embassy.
JERRY WESTERBY: ( With relief ) Yes sir.
BILL HAYDON: You go and tell your Masters what will happen if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head is damaged.
JERRY WESTERBY: Any more news on him?
BILL HAYDON: We need to go to his flat. Clear out anything linked.
PETER GUILLAM: Haydon heard the news at his
SMILEY: The Saville.
PETER GUILLAM: At one-thirty? The ticker-tape wouldn't be running.
SMILEY: PETER GUILLAM
PETER GUILLAM: Jesus Christ. Haydon? How could he have known?
SMILEY: It's not him, Peter.
PETER GUILLAM: Then how did he know?
SMILEY: ( gently ) Because he was at my house that night. With Ann.
OLD MAN: Just in case it's of interest, dear. We are observed. Old Filth in the bushes. Not very subtle but there you are.
THE PAST: Yes. Pleasant enough.
SMILEY: Yes. Pleasant enough.
BILL HAYDON: I was just passing, thought I'd call in. Ann was in bed but she insisted on getting up. She said she'll be down in a minute.
JIM PRIDEAUX: Come in, Roach.
ROACH: Sir there's a stranger parked down on the road. He's just sitting
PRIDEAUX: ( Gently ) It's alright, old fella. Don't cry. Nobody ever watched like you, did they? Off you go, now.
ROACH: Are you going to have to leave?
JIM PRIDEAUX: I'll be fine. You get back to bed.
CONTROL: You weren't followed?
PRIDEAUX: Andras Benedek, Hungarian journalist based in Paris.
CONTROL: If you're caught, you keep me out of it. You were acting alone, bit of Private Enterprise.
PRIDEAUX: What information?
CONTROL: Rocketry. Ballistics. Bit of
PRIDEAUX: What else?
CONTROL: ( Beat ) Treasure. He has treasure. The name of the Mole Moscow Centre has planted at the top of the
SMILEY: Which means I was.?
PRIDEAUX: You were Beggarman.
SMILEY: What did you make of it, Jim? Control's theory?
PRIDEAUX: ( Stiff ) I thought it was madness. To think any one of you could have been a traitor. madness. But still you went? Risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd? Why?
SMILEY: But still you went? Risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd? Why?
PRIDEAUX: ( Hard ) I went because Control asked me to go. It's called doing one's duty.
PRIDEAUX: I held on as long as I could, to give everyone else time to get the hell out of there. ( Beat ) Did
SMILEY: ( Beat ) No. They were blown. The story is you blew them to save your own
PRIDEAUX: The Mole. Control's crazy theory. I was going to bury that so deep, they'd never get it out of me. Which was a joke.
SMILEY: Because they already knew. They wanted to know how far Control had got in his investigation.
PRIDEAUX: Because they already knew. They wanted to know how far Control had got in his investigation.
SMILEY: What else?
PRIDEAUX: Circus gossip. Was Percy's wife still drinking, who was Bland screwing in the office. That sort of thing.
SMILEY: Did they ask about me at all?
PRIDEAUX: One of them did.
SMILEY: What did he say about me?
PRIDEAUX: He had a cigarette lighter. Kept flashing it round for me to see. Showed me the inscription. "To George, from Ann. All my love." He reckoned after Bill's fling with her, she might want to change the inscription.
SMILEY: ( Beat, quietly ) That was well said.
PRIDEAUX: He gave me a cigarette.
SMILEY: Prideaux still doesn't look up.
PRIDEAUX: I thought it was my last one.
MAN'S VOICE: ( Russian accent ) Do you know this woman?
PRIDEAUX: I don't know her.
IRINA: A GUARD steps out of the shadows and SHOOTS her in the head, the shot THUNDEROUS in the room. It's horribly unexpected, and Prideaux jerks backward, bewildered and
PETER GUILLAM: Toby Esterhase.
SMILEY: Toby Esterhase.
SMILEY: He gave him a thousand pounds. Told him he was dead now and couldn't come back. Had to become a Lotus Eater - forget everything that happened - Control's theory, Tinker, Tailor. all of it.
PETER GUILLAM: You alright?
SMILEY: Will you watch my back, Peter? Look out for a solo. Just a feeling I've had.
PETER GUILLAM: Yes, George. I'll watch.
RICKI TARR: ( Over headphones ) She said there was a General, work-name Polyakov who was stationed in London. And that Polyakov's real job was to service the mole. He meets him regularly and takes back information the Mole gives him for Karla.
MINISTER: This meeting is not taking place. Is that clear?
SMILEY: Perfectly, Minister. ( Beat ) There is a house, somewhere in this city, where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative. I need the address of that house.
MINISTER: I don't know what you're talking
SMILEY: ( Calmly ) It's Lacon's advice I'm following. ( To Lacon ) You told me to follow in Control's footsteps.
MINISTER: ( Snapping ) Well, I wouldn't consider that sound advice, after the bloody mess Control left us with. It's taken Alleline - and, if I may say so, myself - this long to get us back into the race.
SMILEY: I'm glad you take some of the
MINISTER: That's. that's not possible.
SMILEY: Made possible. By you. When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for. I'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that.
MINISTER: ( Appalled ) Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine! It's been gold!
SMILEY: Just enough glitter, amongst the chicken-feed. Control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in Witchcraft. But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in.
MINISTER: Oh God. We can't be made to look like fucking fools again! Forget Europe, if we have the black men getting to hear about this on Walla-Wallah News! What if we find the Mole and we move him sideways, some department where he can't do any harm? Is the Kremlin likely to boast about Not in their interests sir. They need the Enemy to look like a Well, tell them to play the game. We don't go crowing about their
LACON: Not in their interests sir. They need the Enemy to look like a Well, tell them to play the game. We don't go crowing about their
MINISTER: Well, tell them to play the game. We don't go crowing about their
SMILEY: ( Suddenly ) We are not the prize. We're the
MINISTER: What can we do?
SMILEY: We have one thing the Mole wants.
RICKI TARR: If I go.
PETER GUILLAM: You'll go.
RICKI TARR: . I want your word you'll get Irina back. Don't care who you have to trade. I want a family. Don't wanna end up like you
SMILEY: ( Beat ) I'll do my utmost, Ricki.
TOBY ESTERHASE: What. what's this about George?
SMILEY: It's about which Master you've been serving, Toby.
SMILEY: Intelligence has been leaked, Toby. Someone's been taking files from the Circus.
TOBY ESTERHASE: This is a mistake George, this is The files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they?
SMILEY: The files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they?
TOBY ESTERHASE: Yes. And yes, I delivered them.
TOBY ESTERHASE: . and Bill.
TOBY ESTERHASE: And Roy.
TOBY ESTERHASE: Things aren't always what they seem. You know that George. Moscow thinks Polyakov's working for them, so, every now and then we give him the odd file to take back to them, just chicken-feed, keep his bosses happy. But Polyakov's our Joe, part of a big Operation Witchcraft? Yes, I
SMILEY: Operation Witchcraft? Yes, I
TOBY ESTERHASE: Why are we here? Why are we.?
SMILEY: Who gave you the message for Jim to forget about Tinker Tailor?
TOBY ESTERHASE: To get rid of Connie Sachs? Bland or Haydon. I don't remember. One of them. Maybe Percy. I don't know who.
SMILEY: To get rid of Connie Sachs? Bland or Haydon. I don't remember. One of them. Maybe Percy. I don't know who.
TOBY ESTERHASE: Bland or Haydon. I don't remember. One of them. Maybe Percy. I don't know who.
SMILEY: You're just the messenger? Running between them all. Anything to serve Witchcraft?
TOBY ESTERHASE: I didn't know. I swear I.
SMILEY: Are you still a wanted man, Toby?
TOBY ESTERHASE: You picked the wrong side, Toby.
SMILEY: You picked the wrong side, Toby.
TOBY ESTERHASE: ( crying ) George, you've got to believe me. I would never. I'm loyal, George. I'm loyal!
SMILEY: Give me the address. Where do you meet Polyakov?
SMILEY: What are the safety signals?
MRS MCCRAIG: There's an air duct. Open and all's well. Closed and you're not to enter.
SMILEY: Where is the mike, Mrs McCraig?
MRS MCCRAIG: Whenever the gentlemen are meeting I record the session. The tapes are sent back to the
SMILEY: If you're at all worried you can call Lacon from the basement phone. Let's try the tape recorder shall we?
MACKLEVORE: ( In French ) Guest from London Station, Monsieur
MACKELVORE: ( as they walk on ) The whole service is looking for you, Ricki. They'll skin you alive if they find you.
RICKI TARR: ( mildly ) Maybe I want them to find me.
MACKELVORE: You can go home now, Ben. Leave the books where they are and put the keys into the machines. I'll be talking to London presently under my own steam.
BEN: Okay boss.
RICKI TARR: ( Flat ) Ben stays here.
RICKI TARR: ( dictating ) Ricki Tarr claims to have further information vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.
MENDEL: ( into phone )
SMILEY: ( into phone ) How's he look?
RICKI TARR: Read it aloud.
BEN: Personal for Tarr from
BEN: . send further information.
RICKI TARR: That's the way Percy boy! You keep stalling. I better warn you Ben, there's some lousy people in this outfit. Don't trust a fucking one of them.
SMILEY: I'm here, Mendel.
PETER GUILLAM: He's here.
OLIVER LACON: I won't have bloodshed. I want absolute calm!
ON GUILLAM: . as his nerves and excitement and any hope he might have had of a sense of victory DRAINS AWAY, leaving him with just an odd sense of embarrassment and shame.
SMILEY: I was assured there would be no
BILL HAYDON: It's almost funny George. I know the Inquisitors little bag of tricks. I taught most of them. Don't mind the tears. Just a reaction. An over-reaction, if you like. Craddox says I'll be off in a few days. I keep thinking how I'm going to miss the cricket in
SMILEY: If I can.
BILL HAYDON: There's a girl.Would you give her some money for me? Give her a good cover story. If it helps tell her I love her. It's all here.
SMILEY: Of course.
BILL HAYDON: There's a boy too. Bung him a few quid to shut him up. Take it out of the reptile fund.
SMILEY: I did have one or two questions. About Prideaux.
BILL HAYDON: Damn it! I got him back, didn't
I?: Yes, yes you did. That was good of you. ( Beat ) I'm surprised Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you?
SMILEY: Yes, yes you did. That was good of you. ( Beat ) I'm surprised Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you?
BILL HAYDON: Yes, as a matter of fact he did.
SMILEY: To say what?
BILL HAYDON: So did you.
SMILEY: Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus?
BILL HAYDON: I'm not his bloody office boy.
SMILEY: What are you then?
BILL HAYDON: I'm someone who made his mark.
SMILEY: ( Quietly ) Is there anything you want me to pass on to Ann?
BILL HAYDON: Oh, that was nothing personal, George, I hope you understand that? Karla said you were good, the one we had to worry about. But you do have a blind spot.
SMILEY: Up to a point.
SMILEY: ( Quietly )
BILL HAYDON: ( Of the runners ) Just like us Jim. ( Beat ) Best
ROACH: I made you something.
PRIDEAUX: I don't want you hanging around here. Keep away from me from now on. Go and join the others.
SMILEY: Shall we begin?
