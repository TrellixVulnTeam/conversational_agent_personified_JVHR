"SUBWAY.": INT. SUBWAY - 59TH ST. CHANGE BOOTH - DAY A level above the locals, two above the express trains. Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens. Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille, receives his token, moves on, drops it into the slot, pushes through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending stairways. CAMERA HOLDS on a sign identifying his choice:
MATSON: C'mon, kid out loud so's I can hear what you're doin'.
BUD: I'm checking the passengers getting on and off front and back okay, it's all clear I'm shut- ting the doors; -.rear section

MATSON: How come you wanna be a conductor, anyway? Don't you know the con- ductor's sittin' in the goddam What do you mean, Mr. Matson?
BUD: What do you mean, Mr. Matson?
MATSON: You're visible, for God's sake! Anything goes wrong anyone's got a gripe you're the one they see. Hell, in my twen'y-nine years o' stickin' my head out there I been slugged, spit on, hit by purses, fruit, rolled-up newspapers, baseball mitts an'.I been god- dam lucky! I never been puked on by a drunk like Charlie Boltzen was on the Parkchester line or stabbed in the neck like I heard one fella was on the Astoria BMT
BUD: ( QUIETLY )
MATSON: You take my advice, kid serve your six months an' then put in for Motorman. Watch it, we're cumin' in. Bud looks quickly off, sees the approaching station and hits his transmitter button.
BUD: ( ANNOUNCING ) FIFTY-NINTH STREET
MATSON: No it ain't
BUD: ( CORRECTING )
MATSON: Never say you're sorry, kid somebody'll come back here an' bust your goddam nose.
BUD: ( ANNOUNCING )
MATSON: Yeah if I was you I'd start studyin' for that motorman's exam right now.

BUD: To tell you the.;truth, Mr. Matson, I have been. Want to hear some- Every car on the IRT is seventy-two 75,000 pounds. It holds 44 seats with room for 136 standing.
MATSON: 'Cept at rush hour when you can push in another 20, at least. Honest to God, I. know personally of a case where this guy on a number 5 train dies of a heart attack at Union Square and he has t' wait until the Grand Concourse in the Bronx before enough people get off so's he can fall down.
BUD: Mr. D'Agostino who rode with me last week said that happened on a double -A train on the West Side.
MATSON: Yeah? Who y' gonna believe? A wop or an American?
BUD: ( GRINNING )
MATSON: Stick with it, kid you're doin' great. See ya t'morrow. He crosses to the nearest door as the train decelerates. Bud activates. his mike and announces, waving to Matson as he does.
BUD: Grand Central Station change for the express. This is Grand The train stops, the doors open and Matson steps out, colliding with a very large man ( BROW^?PN ) who is in a hurry to get aboard. His face is adorned with a large, white, bushy mustache, dark glasses, a lot of white hair, a slouch hat and, covering the rest of him, a raincoat. He carries an outsized florist's box, big enough for several dozen- long-stemmed roses, under his. arm, and wears gloves.
IN: The train stops, the doors open and Matson steps out, colliding with a very large man ( BROW^?PN ) who is in a hurry to get aboard. His face is adorned with a large, white, bushy mustache, dark glasses, a lot of white hair, a slouch hat and, covering the rest of him, a raincoat. He carries an outsized florist's box, big enough for several dozen- long-stemmed roses, under his. arm, and wears gloves.
MATSON: What's your hurry, chief? We won't leave without you. Brown says nothing to Matson, does not look at him, does not even seem aware of their cohtact. Matson goes off into the crowd on the platform and Brown heads for the front of the car.
BUD'S VOICE: ( AMPLIFIED )
GREY: Your ass. The man looks around and surveys Grey.
CONTINUED: What about it?
NSFN: What about it?
GREY: Move it. The man glances at Grey for a moment, then moves it. Grey opens the door and steps out onto the platform between the two cars.
WIDER ANGLE: Blue stands at the downtown end of the platform, near the number 10 placard, carrying a bulging canvas valpac in one hazed and a trombone case in the other. A rumbling sound is heard, building, until a train roars through on the northbound express track, its lights flashing between the pillars. In a moment it is gone and the sound dies. Now a young black,.dressed in the latest extravagant PIMP's fashions flaring double-knit trousers, three- inch heels, wide-lapeled jacket and white, extra-wide- brimmed hat, swaggers, loose-jointed, to a spot near Blue and waits, cool and relaxed. He becomes aware of Blue observing him.
PIMP: What's wrong, dude ain't you .never seen a sunset.before? Blue-smiles softly and looks uptrack.
BUD'S VOICE: ( AMPLIFIED )
DOYLE: Hey how do you expect me to ? He stops, suddenly aware that Blue has removed a very large army automatic from his raincoat pocket and has placed the muzzle against his ( Doyle's ) head. Doyle jerks his head back, suddenly, banging it hard against the windowframe. Blue crooks his hand inside the window and now places the gun against the Motorman's cheek, directly under his right eye.
DOYLE: ( TERRIFIED )
BLUE: I'm taking your train.
BROWN'S VOICE: Turn around I 've got some- thing to show you. Bud turns back, inside the car, then looks down.
BLUE: Unlock your cab or. Doyle seems dazed, in a trance. Blue presses on the barrel of his gun, depressing Doyle's cheek.
BLUE: Pay attention to me. Open your cab door or I '.11 kill you.
BROWN: Come in and turn around slow. Brown, florist's box and all, has moved into the small cubicle. When Bud pulls his head in from outside they are very close.
BROWN: Go back out the window and tell me what you see. Bud nods, licks his.dry lips and leans out, looking to the left, downtrack.
BUD'S VOICE: There's someone leaning against the head car.
GREEN: Get rid of your seat. Doyle springs to his feet and swats up the folding seat with a clatter.
DOYLE: Yes, sir!
GREEN: Just take it easy. Now move over to the window and if you try to touch the mike pedal with your foot I'll shoot it off.
CONTINUED: A sharp rapping at the door and Green opens it. Blue squeezes in, placing his bags atop Green's package. it is becoming very crowded in the cab as Blue again pockets his gun.
BLUE: All right, Mr. Green?
GREEN: A hundred percent.
BLUE: Then get it started. Green moves over to face the controls. He stares down at them for a moment, then reaches with his left hand to the controller, his right to the brake handle. Pressing down firmly on the controller, he nudges it to the left.
BROWN: Okay announce the next station. Bud presses the transmitter button.
I: ( ANNOUNCING )
BUD: ( ANNOUNCING )
STOP IS: His voice croaks then fails he can't finish. Brown prods him with his gun. Bud clears his throat, then tries again. I
BUD: ( ANNOUNCING )
BROWN: Come on we're. taking a walk up front.
GREEN: You say when, Mr. Blue.
BLUE: Keep going
DOYLE: You're still in switching. Why don't you peg it up to series? You're green all the way through.
GREEN: We're in no hurry.
BLUE: What happened?
GREEN: She must've bucked.
BLUE: You said you could drive this thing.
GREEN: It wasn't mel
DOYLE: It's the train she bucks all the time especially in switching. She's a dog. Green glances quickly at Doyle and grins.
GREEN: What's your name, motorman?
DOYLE: Denny Doyle, sir.
GREEN: You ever been written up?
DOYLE: Yes, sir once.
CONTINUED: What for?
GREEN: What for?
DOYLE: Running a red signal. The trippers stopped us cold and I hadda climb down and reset 'em by hand but by that time Control knew I was lying dead. I never got written up since. How about you?
GREEN: Twice. once on the Canarsie
BLUE: That's right, Mr. Green tell him all about yourself.
F: Green stops and looks at Blue.
BLUE: ( LOOKING OUT )
GREEN: Yeah I'm taking the brake handle and the reverse key, Denny and I want your cutting key, too. He pulls the reverse key out of its receptacle and holds out his hand. Doyle fishes into his overalls, pulls out the large key and gives it to Green who puts the brake handle and the two bulky keys into his two raincoat pockets, then squeezes by Blue and the packages and goes out.
BLUE: You'll be hearing from Command Center in a minute )r two but you'll ignore the call you won't answer is that perfectly clear?
DOYLE: Yes, sir.
BLUE: Keep still!
GREEN: Thanks, Mr. Grey.
GREY: ( EXAGGERATED )
GREEN: ( TO BUD )
BROWN: ( as Bud hesitates ) You got three seconds to live, conductor one two Bud whips the key from his pocket and hands it to Green, who unlocks the cab door they're standing next to and enters, closing the door after him.
BUD: What's he going to do?
CONTINUED: You wouldn't want me to spoil the INT. SECOND CAR - CAB as Green seats himself before the panel and begins arming it. He fits the brake handle into place, then fishes. the reverse key out of his pocket it is five inches long, with a shiny surface, and a wrench-type handle that fits into a receptacle on the flat portion of the controller and finally inserts the cutting key similar to the reverse key but with a slightly smaller head, and turns it. CLOSE SHOT - SUBWAY TRAIN COUPLIb1GS as they disengage.

PLUMBER: Yeah, but what're we runnin' for?
CAZ: ( RUNNING )
PLUMBER: How come that gate ain't locked?
CAZ: Who's gonna steal a subway train?
PLUMBER: Christ, it stinks down herel Where the hell are we goin'?
CAZ: To the.Tower.
PLUMBER: Tower? Then what're we goin' down Hey, slow up, will ya?
CAZ: That's it up ahead those windows.
PLUMBER: What kinda tower? They've come to the door of the Tower Room. They turn, go up some steps and disappear inside.
G: INT. TOWER ROOM A long, unadorned room with a row of desks with phones, and a door marked "TOILET". Several TOWERMEN ( and MRS. JENKINS, a black Towerwoman ) sit at the desks before the flashing phone consoles, talking to dispatchers, trainmasters and other Towers. The predominant feature of the room, however, i is the electronic Model Board, stretched high across one wall, recording in colored slashes of light the movements of every train that passes through the sector, all of it superimposed on a painted map showing the line's track routes and stations. One of the Towermen, MARINO, rushes over to Caz as he and the Plumber enter.
MARINO: Jesus Christ, Cazâ¢, you picked a helluva day to be late
CAZ: You wanted a plumber down here, didn't you? Whose goddam wedding ring was it?
MARINO: ( POINTING )
MRS. JENKINS: I'm sorry, Mr. Dolowicz it just slipped off.
CAZ: What were you doin'r with your hand in the john, anyway?
MRS. JENKINS: ( indignant ). My hand-wasn't in the john, Mr. Dolowicz it was over the john.
CAZ: What's the difference? ( to the Plumber ) Go fish it out, will ya? As the Plumber heads off, Caz turns to Marino.
CAZ: The classification's been open to women for only a month and already we're in the goddam toilet! ( glancing at the
BOARD ): What the hell's that?
CONTINUED: That's what I've been tryin' -to tell you, Caz a southbound local. He's laying down between 28th and What the hell for?
MARINO: That's what I've been tryin' -to tell you, Caz a southbound local. He's laying down between 28th and What the hell for?
CAZ: What the hell for?
MARINO: Dunno yet.
CAZ: How long?
MARINO: Couple-three minutes. Command Center's been trying to raise him but so far he don't answer the radio. Jesus, Caz why don't he answer the radio?
CAZ: Take it easy, Marino there's lots o' reasons. Maybe he jumped a ball and hadda leave the cab to reset a tripper or a door got hung and he hadda go fix it. Any- thing more serious and he'd'a called in for a car knocker.
MARINO: It's been too long, Caz
CAZ: Then maybe his radio's busted and the sonuvabitch is too lazy to climb down and use a telephone! I'm gonna write him up for.this, goddammit I'm gonna have his assn
TOWERMAN: Hey it's moving! Everyone wheels around to stare up at the Board.
CAZ: For Jesus Christ sake! The dumb bastard's moving backwards!!
MARINO: He's stopped again!
I: INT. SECOND CAR Brown and Bud are waiting as Green steps out. Bud stares at him.
GREEN: What's wrong with you?
BUD: I didn't know these things'd c o o backwards !
BROWN: ( IMPATIENTLY )
BLUE: Any trouble, Mr.'Green?
GREEN: Smooth as silk, Mr. Blue.
BLUE: I unpacked your weapon. Get this thing moving we're run- ning almost two minutes behind. Picking up his submachine gun, and holding it vertically along his pants leg, Blue eases himself through the door and shuts it after him.
REVERSE SHOT: All eyes staring up at the Board ( CAMERA ).
MARINO: She's moving again forward this time!
CONTINUED: I got eyes, haven't I?
CAZ: I got eyes, haven't I?
M MARINO: Well whatever it was, he's okay now, thank God.
BLUE: ( LOUDLY )
.BLUE: You will all remain- seated. Anyone who tries to rise will be shot.
PASSENGERS: Oh my God What'd he say? What's going on? I don't believe it. ( Etc. )
BLUE: And. you will remain silent! There will be no further warning any- one who moves or speaks without permission is going to be killed. There is immediate silence as he-looks around.
BLUE: This weapon fires 450 rounds of .45 calibre ammunition per minute. In other words, if all of you de- cided to rush me simultaneously, not a single one ,of you would get any closer than you are right now. Is that understood? This news is met in stony, awe-struck, terrified silence. Except for the Pimp who smiles, seemingly relaxed.
PIMP: I should'a know'd you was the main man, man.
CAZ: He stopped again! The crazy, dumb-assed sonuvabitch stopped Including Marino, Mrs. Jenkins and the other Towermen.
WIDER ANGLE: Including Marino, Mrs. Jenkins and the other Towermen.
MARINO: What's he doing now? He's half- way between stations.
CAZ: A pure mental case. I'm gonna nail his pecker to the goddam wall for this!

How the hell. can you run a goddam railroad without Grand Central Tower this is the Desk Trainmaster who the fuck's in charge down there? Caz glances at Mrs. Jenkins, grins, and leans over a desk to flip on a mike.
CAZ: It's me, Frank CazDolowicz. We're watchingitonthe Board.
CAZ: On my way, Frank.

CONTINUED: As the. six or seven passengers in the rear section rise and move forward, the cab door opens and Doyle comes out, i followed by Green who is covering him with his gun.
BLUE: Get going, Mr. Green. Green nods and goes to the front, uses a key to slide open the storm door, steps out and closes it again, then jumps down onto the tracks.
BLUE: Motorman come here.
DOYLE: Yes, sir?
BLUE: I want you to walk uptrack and collect all the passengers in the nine cars we out loose, and lead them back to the 28th St. Station is that clear?

HOOKER: Can I go with them, please? I've got this important appointment, you see, and
BLUE: No. No one else can leave.

BLUE: Yes. What's happening is that you're all being held by four dangerous men with machine guns.
OLD MAN: ( SMILING )
QUESTION: The fluorescent lights suddenly go out and the emergency, incandescent bulbs immediately go on, thereby diminishing the brightness in the car by half. There's a general stirring among the Passengers as they look around them, their alarm peaking again.
BLUE: Please be quiet nothing's going to happen if you do as you're told. Get going, Motorman. As Doyle leaves at one end of the train, Green reappears at the other.
BLUE: All right, Mr. Green?
GREEN: All power's out between 14th and 33rd Streets on all four tracks, local and express, north- and southbound. r
BLUE: I still see some tunnel lights.
GREEN: Emergency. They're on A.C. like the signals.
BLUE: ( a pause ). Stay here and leave the cab door open so you can hear the radio. Blue returns to the center of the car but CAMERA stays on Green as he opens the cab door.

I WENTWORTH: Hold on I'm going through !
WENTWORTH'S POV: SHOOTING THROUGH the windshield ( as the SUPERIMPOSED time continues to run: "3:12.26-27-28-29" ) The tail-lights of the cycles are twinkling red'as they begin braking a tractor-trailer is stretched across the street, lining up its rear-end with the narrow opening of a loading bay, in preparation for backing into it. Now the truck starts backing, and while there is still some space open ( on the sidewalk ) it is closing fast. The cycles screech to a stop but it is clear that the truck doesn't intend to as it bumps up onto the sidewalk, and starts for the opening. But it is now too narrow. The screeching brakes of the truck are heard as it starts to skid around, the panorama flashing by sickeningly and, perhaps, a crash and, perhaps, the scene flopping over as the truck, perhaps, rolls over onto one side.
PRESCOTT: Daniels for God's sake answer me! Where's that goddam money ?!

PRESCOTT: Yeah. I'm still here. Tell me something if we were a couple of seconds late you'd have knocked off an innocent person? Affirmative. Now if you're ready, I'll give you instructions for the delivery of the money. Again, I'll have to insist you follow them to the letter.
PRESCOTT: Go ahead. Two unarmed policemen will walk down the track one with the money, the other with a light which he'll flash continuously from side to side in a sweeping motion. When they reach the car the rear door will open and the one with the money will throw it in onto the floor. Then they will both turn and walk back to the 28th Street Station. Acknowledge.
PRESCOTT: I've got it. Is that all? For now. But keep it in mind that the same ground rules apply any wrong move by anyone and we'll kill a hostage.
PRESCOTT: I could've. guessed that part. You have ten minutes to deliver the money. If it isn't here by then
PRESCOTT: Yeah, I know -it's getting mono- tonous. I don't suppose you'll give us longer than ten minutes Ten's more than enough, Prescott

JAMES: ANOTHER ANGLE
ANOTHER ANGLE: From the other side of the pillar as James ducks back behind it, turns his back to it and looks around for another way of amusing himself. He notices his real gun in a holster at his belt and unbuttons the strap, freeing it. Then he assumes the stance of a gunfighter, hand poised over it, knees slightly bent. Then, moving suddenly, he slaps his holster, wheels, fires without aiming and there's a reverberating BANG, the shattering of glass and the figure in the subway car reels back. James looks at his hand in amazement there's no gun in it. Then, at the same-time, Brown has recovered his balance and begins firing his submachine gun, the bullets ricocheting off the metal MED. SHOT - MISKOWSKY & O'KEEFE as they drop onto the roadbed, bullets whining all around For Chrissake, they're shooting at us!, O'Keefe pushes the sack of money in front of them and they press flat behind it.

Brown is just in the process of sitting heavily in the single isolated seat near the door, a dark red patch blossoming on his sleeve, just below the right shoulder, his sub- machine gun resting in his lap. He begins examining his wound with his left hand. Grey sands at the rear door, pressed flat against the wall, peering out.
BLUE: Return to your position, Mr. Grey.
GREY: Maybe they're not through
BLUE: You heard me, Mr. Grey! I don't think there'll be any more.
I: Reluctantly, Grey goes back to mid-car.
BROWN: It's not too bad I think it went right through.
I: Blue spots something, bends and picks up a lump of metal which he tosses to Brown who watches it in his bloodied left hand, glances at it, then throws it away.
BLUE: How does it feel?
BLUE: How many shots were there?
BROWN: Just one the rest was me. I didn't see anything I guess I just got mad no sense to it

BLUE: Keep it steady.
GREEN: I'm still in switching can I push it up a notch?
BLUE: No steady as she goes.
GREEN'S POV: SHOOTING through the windshield. Ahead, the 23rd Street Platform is drawing nearer and there is a CROWD waiting, many leaning over to look uptrack at the approaching train.
GREEN'S VOICE: Jesus look at 'em hanging over the edge. When I was a motorman I had nightmares about them falling off in front of me.

DANIELS: ( INTO MIKE )
DANIELS: Prescott ?
DANIELS: I just had a terrible thought: what if they're not on the train? What if they set the throttle and jumped off? While we're chasing the train they're sneaking out an emergency exit somewhere behind us.
DANIELS: RADIO. ( PRESCOTT ) A.little gizmo called the-dead man's feature. It was built into the controller handle in case a motorman should ever drop dead. It has to have a man's hand pressing down on it at all times in order to work. Otherwise the train stops cold.

GREEN: Do you think he's figured anything out? All those questions
BLUE: Perfectly natural under the circumstances. They're thinking just the way we want them to.
BLUE: Look sharp now it's coming

GREEN: Perfect fit. Blue now hands him a length of pipe, some six inches in length. Green takes it, fits one end into a socket on top of the gimmick, facing toward the windshield, and screws it in. Then Blue hands him his submachine gun. Green looks at him for reassurance.
BLUE: Go ahead. Green attacks the windshield with tine stock of the gun, opening a great splintered hole.
BLUE: Get it all it's got to look Green uses the gun's barrel to scrape around the edges, clearing away the last traces of glass. Blue now hands Green another length of pipe this one about three feet long. Green fits one end over the protruding end of the attached short pipe not screwing it, merely fitting it. The other end extends straight out the glassless windshield.
BLUE: Try.it once make sure it comes away clean. Green yanks at the long pipe and it separates from the shorter one.
GREEN: He reattaches it.

BLUE: I want this train moving in thirty seconds. Tell Mr. Brown and Mr. Grey they.rcan cut the emergency brake cords. Green leaves the cab. Blue examines the gimmick one last time, then follows Green out.
WIDER ANGLE: Including Grey who is cutting the brake cord at the other end of the car. Now, submachine gun in hand, Brown opens the front storm door, crouches and drops out of sight. Then Grey starts for the rear door, hesitates, returns to the Hooker and bends to whisper something in her ear.
HOOKER: You and what army? Snickering, he returns to the rear door, opens it and disappears. At the front of.the car, Green backs out of the door, closing it after him, and is helped down to the roadbed by Brown from below. Only Blue is left. He holds his submachine gun easily cradled in one arm as he moves through the car.
BLUE: You will remain in your seats. Don't try to get up.
CONTINUED: You mean ever?
MAID: You mean ever?
BLUE: I mean remain seated. He has reached the rear, walking backwards, and now gropes behind him for the door handle.
OLD MAN: Aren't you going to tell us what a great bunch of hostages we've been? Blue doesn't answer as he opens the door and backs out onto the metal landing. Then he closes the door and drops down to the track. The Passengers, left alone, look at one another uncertainly.
BLUE: All right, Mr. Green Green, a hand on the protruding pipe connected to the controller handle inside the Motorman's cab, now grabs it with both hands and pushes inward, toward the train.

The W.A.S.P. is trying to open the door to the Motorman's cab, but there's no outside handle so all he can do is pound impotently against it.
