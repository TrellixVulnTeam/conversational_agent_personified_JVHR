QUAIL: All right. come in.
EDGEMAR: My card, Mr. Quail.
QUAIL: Okay so you're Doctor George Edgemar of 'Rekall, Inc.' So?
EDGEMAR: As I said. this is going to be very difficult for both of us.
QUAIL: I'm listening.
EDGEMAR: Mr. Quail. I'm afraid you're not really standing here at this moment.
QUAIL: Sat that again.
EDGEMAR: I said, you're not really here. Neither am I. We're both in the Memory Studio in the offices of Rekall, Inc. On Earth.
QUAIL: Are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some. artificially injected fantasy? That I never really left Earth?
EDGEMAR: No, not quite. We didn't give you this. You're creating it Remember the option we offered you? Intelligence agent? Something inside you liked that idea, fastened on it. What you're experiencing now is a free-form delusion that you yourself are fabricating.
QUAIL: What is this shit you're giving me?
EDGEMAR: This is not shit, Mr. Quail. It's the truth. I know it's very hard for you to accept, but you're having a schizophrenic reaction. we can't snap you out of the Narkadine. You're in a world of your own fantasy.
QUAIL: Then how the hell can you be in my dream if you know it's just a dream?
EDGEMAR: I've been artificially implanted like the first part of your fantasy. I'm actually monitoring your dream at a psychoprobe console. This is a last resort. When somebody gets stuck in their own fantasy, we send in someone after them. A specialist, like myself.
QUAIL: I don't believe a word you're I was afraid you'd think that. I'm sorry to have to do this, but you really are stuck. Doctor Noel, would you come in now please?

MELINA: Yes, Mr. Quail, I'm afraid it's all true.
MELINA: ( continuing ) I tried to break through to you earlier, but you just molded me into your fantasy. Sometimes it takes Dr. Edgemar to get through to a client as tough as you.
QUAIL: ( wavering ) So what's supposed to happen Just do exactly as we tell ( stares at him Somehow that doesn't appeal to me.
EDGEMAR: Just do exactly as we tell Somehow that doesn't appeal to me.
QUAIL: ( stares at him Somehow that doesn't appeal to me.
MELINA: Please, Mr. Quail. try to cooperate. You're having a schizophrenic embolism.
EDGEMAR: If we can't get you out now. you may never come out of it. Your wife calls every day
QUAIL: If this is a fantasy, there'll be no real consequences when I pull this trigger.
EDGEMAR: But there will by consequences inside your mind. Consequences that won't hurt me. but could be fatal to you. If you shoot me, you'll wipe me out of your fantasy I can't come back again. Because to you, I'll be dead. I can't help you get back to reality. You'll be stuck in permanent
EDGEMAR: You're going to lower the gun, Mr. Quail. You're going to hand it to me
EDGEMAR: You're going to do exactly what I tell you
MELINA: Watch out, Charles! There's more of them in the hall!
MELINA: ( whispering ) There's an explosive in the clipboard! He has a dead-man switch in his hand!
QUAIL: What happens it I come out?
QUAIL: All right. Here comes the
QUAIL: Back in, quick!
WAITER: Wouldn't you prefer your order in your room, sir?
QUAIL: Quail bundles the waiter unceremoniously back inside the 84C INT. LIFT - NIGHT Quail presses the basement button. As he talks to Melina he opens the champagne and pours two glasses. The waiter is too frightened to protest.
QUAIL: Okay. Answers! Now!
MELINA: They kidnapped me. Said they'd kill you if I didn't cooperate. I told them I didn't care, but then when I realized they meant it.
QUAIL: I don't know why they're after me, but what's your connection with all this?
MELINA: We were together before.
QUAIL: Believe me, I'm really sorry I can't recall the details of that encounter.
MELINA: Go, Bennie, for God's sake!
BENNIE: ( glances in Bad news, boss lady.
MELINA: Black cruiser just pull out behind us.
BENNIE: Black cruiser just pull out behind us.
BENNIE: Forget the shooter, boss. I lose 'em for you.
QUAIL: Lose them? In this?
BENNIE: Hang on!
QUAIL: ( shouts over
GUNFIRE ): You're gonna get a ticket for that engine, Bennie
BENNIE: Yutani 650 you like it, boss? Nothing like the old gas when you want a bit of
MELINA: You better have two aces, There's a second cruiser and it's gaining
COHAAGEN: I take it, then, you've failed to get him again.
COHAAGEN: ( continuing ) Proceed with Operation Sphinx.
EMILE: But, sir.
COHAAGEN: With him. .on the lose, I'm not taking any more chances. Operation Sphinx will flush him out.
QUAIL: What's all this?
BENNIE: Nothin', boss. Just old smokies. Only place they can come for a puff. It's all banned topside.
QUAIL: So you two are into something a bit more serious than the taxi and truck-stop business.
BENNIE: That's right, boss.
QUAIL: My God!. T-shirts. They died out on Earth years ago.
BENNIE: ( hurt ) Well, maybe we ain't fashion leaders, boss.
MELINA: No. But we still believe in a free Mars. So where did I fit into all You - when you were Charles Hauser with E.I.O - infiltrated our group. I guess Cohaagen didn't trust you any more when you and
QUAIL: So where did I fit into all You - when you were Charles Hauser with E.I.O - infiltrated our group. I guess Cohaagen didn't trust you any more when you and
MELINA: You - when you were Charles Hauser with E.I.O - infiltrated our group. I guess Cohaagen didn't trust you any more when you and
QUAIL: Yeah. And I can't even remember it. We'll have to arrange a return bout.
MELINA: .so he had your memory wiped and fixed you up with a new identity.
QUAIL: But - the Sphinx. Why is that stuck in my mind? Why's it so important?
MELINA: I don't know.
BENNIE: Just an ole heap o' stone, It's more than that, Bennie, I know it's more. Somehow it's connected.
QUAIL: It's more than that, Bennie, I know it's more. Somehow it's connected.
MELINA: ( reflecting ) Maybe there's a way you can get your memory back.
QUAIL: How? What? Where? When?
MELINA: A bit of Martian Wisdom. We're not all stupid
MELINA: He's doing it!
QUAIL: What? Why?
MELINA: Clearing everyone out! It's been rumored for months.
QUAIL: Wow. I can see why I was willing to betray E.I.O.
MELINA: I though you believed in our cause?
QUAIL: Yes. Of course. That, too.
STRANGE MAN: ( nodding to Your servant, Fahreem Kuato. I greet you by the twenty-seven names that still remain, praying that you cast jewels into the darkness and given them to glow with the colors of life.
QUAIL: What use is this weirdo?
MELINA: Ssssh.there are skills on mars that Earth has forgotten.
KUATO: No need to introduce yourself, Mr. Quail. Tolerate my presumption, but it does not tax my powers to know that you are the most sought-after man on two
KUATO: ( continuing ) This way, my dear man. We have much to accomplish ( ominously ) and very little time.
KUATO: The turbulence you hear outside is but a reflection of the turmoil within you. You have brought it to Mars in your search for yourself.
QUAIL: And you're going to help me by reading my mind?
KUATO: Indubitably. There is only small matter of a fee.
QUAIL: A fee!
KAUTO: This is for our cause!
MELINA: This is for our cause!
KUATO: ( soothingly ) Income before ideals. Shall we say five-hundred-thousand ( appalled ) Five-hundred-thousand Martian dollars, that's. ( think,
QUAIL: ( appalled ) Five-hundred-thousand Martian dollars, that's. ( think,
KUATO: Not Martian dollars, Mr. Quail - Earth dollars.
MELINA: That's interplanetary robbery!
QUAIL: With today's exchange rate. that's over two million Martian dollars!
KUATO: ( suave ) What price do you put, Mr. Quail, on the future of the solar system?
BENNIE: Aw, come off it, man. Just for a bit of mumbo-jumbo with a crystal ball.
KUATO: ( his manner Listen, buster, we're talking heavy stuff here. You try and work out what's with this
QUAIL: Okay! Okay! I'll pay it, but the Interstellar Trade Practices Commission might be interested in this.
KUATO: Retrieving the past is like walking backwards along a perilous road. The half-recalled, the half-forgotten, the repressed, the fantasies, the triumphs, joys, failures, betrayals.
KUATO: ( continuing ) Yes. I can feel it. a wall. Erasure techniques are so brutal. ( frowns; scans Blocks. Side channels. Future and past all jumbled. I shall have to enter deep trance to break through. ( rising ) I will be scanning you through the Oracle Head.
ORACLE HEAD: Do not fear me. I need your Open you thoughts to my
ORACLE HEAD: ( continuing ) Open you thoughts to my
ORACLE HEAD: ( continuing )
MELINA: ( rushes to Quail ) Charles! Are you all right?
MELINA: ( continuing ) He kept dragging you deeper and deeper into the trance! We couldn't wake either of You stopped breathing!
BENNIE: You stopped breathing!
QUAIL: Why did you kill him? It was the next bit I really.
BENNIE: No choice, boss. It was him or you.
ORACLE HEAD: ( whispers ) the vengence you seek. and the salvation of Mars. are waiting for you in the crown of the Sphinx. ( sags, gasping ) Phobos and Demos! What was that all about?
BENNIE: Phobos and Demos! What was that all about?
MELINA: Are you okay?. Charles? Doug? Whoever?
QUAIL: Stands. For a moment his back is to Melina and Bennie. Then he turns. He has become a different man. His eyes gleam. He is forceful, purposeful, contained. Once again the ace E.I.O. agent. Melina senses immediately that this is the man she knew before
QUAIL: ( even his voice I'm fine. only I'm not Doug I'm Charles Hauser. and I know everything Hauser
QUAIL: ( continuing ) Bennie, where's your depot?
BENNIE: ( working it out ) Well. you go outta here. take a left, then down past the first. no second. water bureau you.
QUAIL: ( briskly ) Can you get us there?
BENNIE: No problem.
MELINA: But why?
QUAIL: We're going to the Sphinx.
BENNIE: Impossible, man. Guards The Oracle. what did you Only everything. I've got total recall.
MELINA: The Oracle. what did you Only everything. I've got total recall.
QUAIL: Only everything. I've got total recall.
BENNIE: We'll never get near the Sphinx! They'll blow us
MELINA: What are we doing, Charles? For God's sake, tell us.
QUAIL: The Sphinx. it's not some useless artifact, it's a machine built by some alien race eighteen millions years ago. The same race that built the on one Earth. for the same purpose.
QUAIL: ( continuing ) This is what we need.
BENNIE: ( referring to the It's a hunk of old stone, ( ditto ) Purpose? What purpose?
MELINA: ( ditto ) Purpose? What purpose?
QUAIL: Come on, Bennie, move it. Have you heard the word,
BENNIE: ( calling to Just deliverin' some old junk to the mine out at Apidalia Planitia. Got them people you're lookin' for in the back as well.
QUAIL: The machine in the Sphinx is tapped straight down to the molten core of this planet. There are tunnels and ducts everywhere, all powered by fusion generators.
BENNIE: You sure the little man didn't fry your brain, Quail?
MELINA: ( overlapping ) For what? To do what?
QUAIL: To combine elements in the Martian core and release them as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen.
BENNIE: That's air!
QUAIL: That's right. Air and water. Terriforming will create a permanent livable environment for Mars. No more pressurized cities, no more containers in the desert. There'll be rivers, vegetation - life - the same as Earth.
MELINA: ( baffled ) So why is Cohaagen shipping everyone out?
QUAIL: Don't you see?! From being a pile of red dirt with minerals, Mars is going to change into a chunk of priceless real estate.
MELINA: And Cohaagen's going to own it all!
QUAIL: Right! He can start selling it off to well-heeled investors from Earth. Beach condos, ski resorts, you name it.
MELINA: No wonder he wanted you to. penetrate. out group.
QUAIL: ( nods ) Once word of this gets out, the whole planet will support
MELINA: So what can we do?
QUAIL: Ruin his little scheme by terriforming ahead of schedule - while the inhabitants are still here.
MELINA: But who'll work the machine? Do you know how?
QUAIL: I'm the only one who does. Why do you think Cohaagen's left me alone all this time?
QUAIL: I was the first one inside when they cracked the riddle of the Sphinx. It must've been programmed. Some kind of.force.shot into me.
MELINA: But Cohaagen wiped your Just a way of putting me on ice. He'd of reversed it once the planet was evacuated.
QUAIL: ( smoothly ) Just a way of putting me on ice. He'd of reversed it once the planet was evacuated.
BENNIE: Man! This is real complicated. Go over it again, real slow.
QUAIL: ( ignoring Bennie's What he hadn't counted on was your effect on me.
MELINA: ( smiling ) And all without the marvels of modern science!
QUAIL: Bennie, don't stop now, take You bastard.
MELINA: You bastard.
BENNIE: Like I said. It's a tough planet. I'm a baddie, not a goodie.
QUAIL: I should have known, you were just too helpful.
BENNIE: EIO Rule One, man. Trust Nobody. Now you can do your terriforming stuff right when those space shuttles are gone.
MELINA: But what about the Martian people? Out cause? I thought you believed in it.
BENNIE: Your cause? That bunch of dead beat radicals! When I hand in this little number. .I'll get real estate rights on the whole of Chryse
BENNIE: This makes Bennie a cut above anyone else.
VACUUM!: Now no one can breathe. They all claw for their masks, [still] in place. Bennie is first; he recovers, lunges with his SPINNING ARM for Quail. Quail barely dodges, grabs the arm, muscles it back toward Bennie The SPINNING BLADES SEVER BENNIE'S OWN OXYGEN LINE! Gasp- ing, he falters. Quail aims a titanic blow, PUNCHES BENNIE out through the hole in the mole's wall! Quail and Melina, masks on, stare out as Bennie claws desperately at his severed air line. The Martian vacuum pulls the oxygen from Bennie's lungs, he chokes, staggers
QUAIL: ( shouts over Hope I've got this direction
COHAAGEN: The air supply is off under the domes?
EMILE: Yes, sir. In a couple of hours it'll be all gone.
COHAAGEN: Any trouble with the rabble?
EMILE: Not much, sir. A lot of complaining. But they're all heading towards the shuttle areas.
MELINA: We got in with this thing, but we'll never get back out.
QUAIL: A shame. Such a pleasant
QUAIL: ( points down This is the main tap straight down to the core of Mars. When we trigger the mechanism, fusion reactors will detonate down there four hundred miles Remind me not to slip.
MELINA: Remind me not to slip.
QUAIL: The new elements will come booming up through this shaft and six thousand others all around the
GUARD LEADER: ( to two of his Stay in contact. I want to hear from this checkpoint every four minutes.
GUARD #1: Did you hear something?
GUARD #2: No. Where?
GUARD #1: Over there. I'm not there, boys. I'm
GUARD #1: ( to Guard #2 ) Watch him. He was EIO trained. They're all full of tricks.
GUARD #2: Yeah? Like.who was that guy? Fred Bond?? Keep 'em up, Fred, keep 'em
GUARD #1: A hologram!
MELINA: ( running ) Where'd you get that little ( running ) Mail-order company. It's a great one for fooling the
QUAIL: ( running ) Mail-order company. It's a great one for fooling the
COHAAGEN: How the hell did they get in?
SECURITY AIDE: Up the fusion core.
COHAAGEN: Up the fusion core??
SECURITY AIDE: ( studies monitor They're on Level One.
COHAAGEN: Seal all upper levels.
QUAIL: ( indicates Know how to use one of these?
QUAIL: He hurls something toward the armed men in the elevator. Instinctively one of them reaches for the thrown object. It is an explosive device of some sort. Quail and Melina press themselves against the wall just around a corner from the elevator. There is a tremendous explosion. Quail, followed by Melina, rounds a corner. The elevator is in ruins; bodies are scattered everywhere.
MELINA: Great stuff, but how do we get up?
COHAAGEN: Forget them. We'll pick up Quail once the shuttles have left for Earth.
QUAIL: If you're afraid of the heights, you better get over it real quick.
EMILE: If Quail's the only one who can operate all this. .then he can call all the We'll tell him the computer's worked out the operational details so we don't really need him. We're just doing him a favor.
COHAAGEN: We'll tell him the computer's worked out the operational details so we don't really need him. We're just doing him a favor.
EMILE: And if that doesn't work?
COHAAGEN: We offer him rewards.
EMILE: What if that doesn't work?
COHAAGEN: We'll torture him. You don't think I got this far by being a nice guy?
OPERATOR: First of the shuttles ready for departure, sir. Two minute countdown.
COHAAGEN: Seal the breach! Repressurize!
MELINA: Those shuttles are starting up any minute. If you know how to work this thing, you better do it now.
QUAIL: He hesitates.
MELINA: Don't you know how? Yes. there's a vital connection missing.
QUAIL: Yes. there's a vital connection missing.
QUAIL: ( continuing ) Don't wait!
COHAAGEN: Don't wait!
MELINA: Don't wait!
COHAAGEN: If you activate the mechanism you'll die.there were glimpses of it in your Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a long tunnel, a brilliant white light, hands reaching for me.
QUAIL: Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a long tunnel, a brilliant white light, hands reaching for me.
COHAAGEN: ( assured ) That's your death. That's what it looks like. That's what is always looks like.
MELINA: ( looking toward Charles - for Mars's sake..
COHAAGEN: It's not too late. Join us again. U've a lot to offer. A whole world.
QUAIL: You don't deserve a new world, you and people like you made too big a mess of the old one. Time someone else had a

MASKED MINER: I won't lie to you, pal. You are. I'd say in about forty years. .come on, we've gotta get to the Space Port. That Intergalactic Napoleon's switched off the air.
2ND MINER: Shippin' us all out. Mars is finished.
MELINA: It's happening.
MINER: What is it?
