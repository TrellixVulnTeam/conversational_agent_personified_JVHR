CREDITS: CREDITS appear over scenes from MANHATTAN NIGHTLIFE. The snow has melted, it is spring. A rainy, slick, wet miserable night in Manhattan's theatre Cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere; well-dressed pedestrians are pushing, running, waving down taxis. The high-class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the poor and common is also falling on them. The unremitting SOUNDS of HONKING and SHOUTING play against the dull pitter-patter of rain. The glare of yellow, red and green lights reflects off the pavements and autos. "When it rains, the boss of the city is the taxi driver" - so goes the cabbie's maxim, proven true by this particular night's activity. Only the taxis seem to rise above the situation: They glide effortlessly through the rain and traffic, picking up whom they choose, going where they please. Further uptown, the crowds are neither so frantic nor so glittering. The rain also falls on the street bums and aged poor. Junkies still stand around on rainy street corners, hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks. And the taxis service them too. All through the CREDITS the exterior sounds are muted, as if coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner. The listener is at a safe but privileged distance. After examining various strata of Manhattan nightlife, CAMERA begins to CLOSE IN on one particular taxi, and it is assumed that this taxi is being driven by TRAVIS BICKLE.
END CREDITS: CUT TO:
TRAVIS: Why should it be grounded?
TRAVIS: Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
TRAVIS: Have you tried the telephone?

1ST CABBIE: . hadda piss like a bull steer, so I pull over on 10th Ave, yank up the hood and do the engine job. There I am with my dong in my hand when a guy come up and asks if I need any help. Just checking the battery, I says, and, meanwhile.
2ND CABBIE: If he thinks I'm going up into The Jungle this time of night, he can shove it.

CONCESSION STAND: A plain dumpy-looking GIRL sits listlessly on a stool behind the shabby concession stand. A plaster-of-Paris Venus de Milo sits atop a piece of purple velvet cloth on the counter.
CONCESSION GIRL: Kin I help ya?
TRAVIS: What is your name? My name is Travis.
CONCESSION GIRL: Awh, come off it, Pal.
TRAVIS: No, I'm serious, really.
CONCESSION GIRL: Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
CONCESSION GIRL: No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola - without ice - and a large buttered popcorn, and. . some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls. and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
CONCESSION GIRL: We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
TRAVIS: That's fine.
CONCESSION GIRL: That's a dollar forty-seven.
INSIDE HEADQUARTERS: A variety of YOUNG WORKERS joke and chatter as they labor through stacks of papers. The room is pierced with the sound of ringing phones. Seen from a distance - the only way Travis can see them - those are America's chosen youth: Healthy, energetic, well- groomed, attractive, all recruited from the bucolic fields of Massachusetts and Connecticut. CAMERA FAVORS BETSY, about 25, an extremely attractive woman sitting at the reception desk between two phones and several stacks of papers. Her attractions, however, are more than skin deep. Beneath that Cover Girl facial there is a keen, though highly specialized sensibility: Her eyes scan every man who passes her desk as her mind computes his desirability: Political, intellectual, sexual, emotional, material. Simple pose and status do not impress her; she seeks out the extraordinary qualities in men. She is, in other words, star-fucker of the highest order. Betsy, putting down the phone, calls TOM, a lanky, amiable and modishly long-haired campaign workder over to her desk:
BETSY: Tom is pleasant and good-looking, but lacks those special qualities which interest Betsy. He gets nowhere with Betsy - yet he keeps trying.
BETSY: Tom, come here a moment. I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county. And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
TOM: The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
BETSY: Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
TOM: I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
BETSY: ( as if instructing a child ) First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
TOM: You forgot "sexy".
BETSY: No, I didn't forget "sexy".
TOM: Just didn't get around to it, huh?
BETSY: Oh, Tom, please.
TOM: Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling. I don't know what. cars. not issues.
BETSY: Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
TOM: More people watch it.
BETSY: Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
TOM: No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was Just what?
BETSY: Just what?
TOM: Kidding around. you know, fun.
BETSY: Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
TOM: With who?
BETSY: Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it.
TOM: Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
BETSY: That's the last. The finish. Period. Some pople can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious
TOM: Sure we could run him. You realize he's already of his block Have you been noticing anything No, why?
BETSY: ( looks across street again ) Have you been noticing anything No, why?
TOM: No, why?
BETSY: Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
TOM: What taxi driver?
BETSY: That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
TOM: How long has he been there?
BETSY: I don't know - but it feels like a long time.
TOM: ( determined ) Well, I'll go out and ask him.
WIZARD: First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge.
WIZARD: The kind with a brush.
WIZARD: Hey Wizard.
TRAVIS: Hey Wizard.
WIZARD: ( ironic ) Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
WIZARD: ( continuing ) Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind - and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri- boro bridge - she changes her Could you see anything?
WIZARD: Could you see anything?
WIZARD: Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
WIZARD: Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out - What do you think! What do I have to do? Draw you a What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic. So howsit?
WIZARD: What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic. So howsit?
TRAVIS: ( w/o inflection ) Some fleet driver for Bell just cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
WIZARD: Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge."
WIZARD: Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge."
WIZARD: She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? but she stiffed me. A real skunk.
WIZARD: ( paternal ) Travis, you know Dough-Boy, Charlie
T.?: Charlie T. nods sleepily. Travis indicates he knows Dough-Boy.
WIZARD: We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
WIZARD: ( to Travis ) So howsit?
TRAVIS: ( w/o inflection ) Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
TRAVIS: No, just some crazy fucker. Cut have his ear off.
TRAVIS: In the jungle. 122nd.
WIZARD: ( referring to 122nd St. ) Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
TRAVIS: I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
TRAVIS: ( catching on ) I have.
TRAVIS: ( a beat ) I suppose not.
WIZARD: The cops and company raise hell they find out.
WIZARD: For a fee.
WIZARD: I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
WIZARD: What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
BETSY: Try holding the match like this.
TOM: This is gotta be a game, right?
BETSY: ( putting on glasses ) This I gotta see.
TOM: ( burning fingers ) ( giggling ) Oh, are you all right?
BETSY: ( giggling ) Oh, are you all right?
TOM: I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
BETSY: No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
TOM: Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos.
BETSY: He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when -
TOM: Is he Italian?
BETSY: No, why?
TOM: You sure he's not Italian?
BETSY: He's Black, OK?
TOM: Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pidgeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
BETSY: As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pidgeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
TOM: Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pidgeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
BETSY: Why don't they leave a pidgeon instead of a canary?
TOM: I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
BETSY: First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change - the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
TOM: With the other hand, right?
BETSY: No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
TOM: I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at -
BETSY: No, this is young - well, I'm never sure how old Black people are - but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
TOM: Show me how he did that again.
TRAVIS: ( at Betsy's desk ) I want to volunteer. ( at Betsy's desk ) If you'll come this way.
TOM: ( at Betsy's desk ) If you'll come this way.
TRAVIS: ( to Betsy ) No. I want to volunteer to you.
TOM: ( under his voice )
BETSY: ( curious ) And why is that?
TRAVIS: Because you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
BETSY: ( smiling ) Is that so? ( pause ) But what do you think of Charles ( his mind elsewhere ) Who mam?
TRAVIS: ( his mind elsewhere ) Who mam?
BETSY: Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
TRAVIS: Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
BETSY: You want to canvass?
TRAVIS: Yes, mam.
BETSY: How do you feel about Senator Palantine's stand on welfare?
TRAVIS: Welfare, mam? I think the Senator's right. People should work for a living. I do. I like to work. Every day. Get those old coots off welfare and make 'em work for a Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
BETSY: Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
TRAVIS: I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
BETSY: ( gesturing ) if you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
TRAVIS: If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
BETSY: Well, we're all working tonight.
TRAVIS: Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
BETSY: Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
TRAVIS: ( bolstering courage ) If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
BETSY: Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.
TRAVIS: Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.
BETSY: I don't know.
TRAVIS: It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
BETSY: ( smiles ) All right. ( relents ) All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.

BETSY: Thank you, Travis. I'm just going to find out what the cabbies are thinking.
BETSY: I'm just going to find out what the cabbies are thinking.
BETSY: We've signed up 15.000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
TRAVIS: I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm Gonna Organezizied".
BETSY: ( laughing ) Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
TRAVIS: I can believe that.
BETSY: Where do you live?
TRAVIS: ( evasive ) Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
BETSY: So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
TRAVIS: I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
BETSY: After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
TRAVIS: Yeah, well. In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
BETSY: What kind of people?
TRAVIS: Just people people, you know. Just Had a dead man once.
BETSY: He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked What did you do?
TRAVIS: He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked What did you do?
BETSY: What did you do?
TRAVIS: I shot the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't goimg to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
BETSY: That's really something.
TRAVIS: Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's The moon?
BETSY: The moon?
TRAVIS: The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdoes in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was - the full moon.
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. People will do anything in front of a taxi driver. I mean anything. People too cheap to rent a hotel room, people scoring dope, people shooting up, people who want to embarrass you. It's like you're not even there, not even a person. Nobody knows you.
BETSY: Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
TRAVIS: I know. I could have picked you up.
BETSY: Late one night. About three. At the Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
TRAVIS: Late one night. About three. At the Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
BETSY: Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
TRAVIS: No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
BETSY: You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
TRAVIS: If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
BETSY: The DMZ?
TRAVIS: South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
BETSY: That would have been quite a You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
TRAVIS: You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
BETSY: Well, I don't go to the Plaza every I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know - Dough-Boy - met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
TRAVIS: I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know - Dough-Boy - met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
BETSY: That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
TRAVIS: Well, no. not really. had some famous people in the cab. I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
BETSY: ( laughs ) What hours do you work?
TRAVIS: I work a single, which means there's no replacement - no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
BETSY: ( amazed ) You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
TRAVIS: Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
BETSY: You must be rich.
TRAVIS: ( big affectionate smile ) it keeps ya busy.
BETSY: You know what you remind me of?
TRAVIS: That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly ficition, a walking contradiction".
BETSY: That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly ficition, a walking contradiction".
TRAVIS: I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
TRAVIS: I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
TRAVIS: ( more at ease ) Oh. Who was that again?
BETSY: The singer?

TRAVIS: ( interrupting ) Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
PALANTINE: ( only mildly irritated ) Yes I am.
TRAVIS: Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
PALANTINE: ( pleased; glances to check Travis' license ) Why, thank you Travis.
TRAVIS: I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you. I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
PALANTINE: ( pleasant ) I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
TOM: ( joking ) And in some other places too.
PALANTINE: Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
TRAVIS: I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
PALANTINE: There must be something.
TRAVIS: ( thinks ) Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it.
PALANTINE: ( after a pause ) I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical ( turning the wheel ) Damn straight.
TRAVIS: ( turning the wheel ) Damn straight.
PALANTINE: Nice talking to you, Travis.

TRAVIS: I don't follow music much. I'd like to though. So you haven't heard this record yet?

TRAVIS: ( sly smile ) I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
BETSY: What are you doing?
TRAVIS: ( innocent ) I bought a couple of tickets.
BETSY: But this is a porno movie.
TRAVIS: No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.

BETSY: What's wrong?
TRAVIS: I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
TRAVIS: Where are you going?
BETSY: I'm leaving.

INSIDE TAXI: Dough-Boy leans back from the wheel and greets Travis as he In the back seat, beside Travis, sits ANDY, an attractive young man about 29. He wears a pin-striped suit, white shirt and floral tie. His hair is modishly long.
ANDY: Hello Travis.
ANDY: This is fine, Dough-Boy Pay Dough-Boy here. 20 bucks?
TRAVIS: 20 bucks?
ANDY: Dough-Boy probably told you I don't carry any Saturday Night Specials or crap like that. It's all out of State, clean, brand new, top-of- the-line stuff.
TRAVIS: You got a .44 Magnum?
ANDY: That's an expensive gun.
TRAVIS: I got money.
ANDY: ( admiringly ) It's a monster. Can stop a car put a bullet right into the block. A premium high resale gun. $350 that's only a hundred over list.
ANDY: I could sell this gun in Harlem for $500 today - but I just deal high quality goods to high quality Now this may be a little big for practical use, in which case I'd recommend the .38 Smith and Wesson Special. Fine solid gun - nickel plated. Snub-nosed, otherwise the same as the service revolver. Now that'll stop anything that moves and it's handy, flexible.
TRAVIS: I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
ANDY: That's the Colt .25 - a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
TRAVIS: How much for everything.
ANDY: The .32's $150 - and you're really getting a good deal now - and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty-five for four pieces and a holster. He'll, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal - a good one.
TRAVIS: How much to get a permit to carry?
ANDY: Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
TRAVIS: Nah, this'll be fine.
ANDY: You can't carry in a cab even with a permit - so why bother?
TRAVIS: Is there a firing range around?
ANDY: Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
ANDY: You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
TRAVIS: ( looking up ) Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
ANDY: Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
TRAVIS: Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
ANDY: ( through counting ) It's he'll out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all ( pockets the money )
TRAVIS: ( intensely ) They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first. ( pause ) You got anything to carry these in? ( gestures to pistols )
ANDY: Andy pulls a gym bag from under his bed. He wraps the gun in the sheet in the bag and zips it up. An identical gym bag can be partially seen under the bed. He hands Travis the bag.
ANDY: You like ball games?
TRAVIS: I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
ANDY: I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
TRAVIS: Nah. I ain't interested.
ANDY: Okay, okay.
ANDY: Wait a second, Travis. I'll walk you out.
IRIS: Come on, mister, let's get outta here quick.
SPORT: ( to IRIS ) Come on, baby, let's go. This is all a real drag.
SPORT: Just forget all about this, cabbie. It's nothing.
TRAVIS: Hey 'Melio. Come on, man. Quick, quick, quick. Hand over that bread.
TRAVIS: Hey dude!
'MELIO: Thanks, man. Figured I'd get him on the way out.
TRAVIS: You're gonna have to cover me on this one, 'Melio. I can't stay for the cop show.
'MELIO: You can't do that, Travis. You're my witness.
TRAVIS: The hell I can't. It's no sweat for you. What is this for you, number five?
'MELIO: No, only four. Alright, Travis, I'll do what I can.
TRAVIS: Thanks a lot.
TRAVIS: ( to himself ) Damn, damn.
WIZARD: You know Eddie, he's the new hippie kid in our group, long hair.
WIZARD: .he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our One-Ball McCall?
WIZARD: That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, "Hey, what do you want me to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do?
CHARLIE T: This is on the two-way with about a hundred and fifty cars listenin in.
WIZARD: McCall says. "How much on the meter?" Eddie comes back and says "Two-fifty." McCall says, "Is she worth it".
WIZARD: And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
FOURTH CABBIE: She should have told him to get an OK from the front office.
WIZARD: McCall says, "Well, if you want some help I'll see if I can send some units out."
CHARLIE T: Yeah. About a hundred and fifty.
WIZARD: She was just a kid. Stoned, you
CHARLIE T: Hiya Killer.
WIZARD: You're getting a rep, Travis. Got the five you owe me, Killer?
CHARLIE T: Got the five you owe me, Killer?
TRAVIS: CHARLIE T
CHARLIE T: Shit yes. Night woulda been dead if I hadn't grabbed an outatowner at Kennedy. Took him roun the horn and got a five dollar tip to boot.
WIZARD: ( joking ) One of these days we're gonna turn you in, Charlie T. Fleecin the hicks like that.
CHARLIE T: Hell, I know'd you to do worse.
CHARLIE T: ( chuckling ) It's a living.
WIZARD: Well, I'm shovin' on.
TRAVIS: Hey Wiz, just a second. I wanna talk to you. See ya, Killer. Don't forget your pea shooter.
CHARLIE T: See ya, Killer. Don't forget your pea shooter.
TRAVIS: ( walking ) Hey Wiz.
TRAVIS: ( hesitant ) Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me.
WIZARD: Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me.
TRAVIS: Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me.
WIZARD: I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
TRAVIS: I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
WIZARD: Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
TRAVIS: Well, I just, you know.
WIZARD: Things got ya down?
TRAVIS: Real down.
WIZARD: It happens.
TRAVIS: Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
WIZARD: The taxi life, you mean.
TRAVIS: ( nods ) I know.
WIZARD: ( nods ) I know.
TRAVIS: Like do anything, you know.
WIZARD: Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it. You see, that must be what I am.
WIZARD: ( continuing ) Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
TRAVIS: ( pause ) That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
WIZARD: What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know? I don't even know what you're talking about.
TRAVIS: Neither do I, I guess.
WIZARD: You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
WIZARD: Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
WIZARD: Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all I seen enough to know.
TRAVIS: WIZARD gives TRAVIS a short wave implying, "Chin up, old boy," and walks around to the driver's side of his cab. WIZARD drives off, leaving the street to its natural FADE IN: EXT. CHARLES PALANTINE RALLY - DAY A rally platform in a supermarket parking lot somewhere in QUEENS is draped in red, white and blue bunting. A CROWD of about 500 persons mills about, waiting for the rally to begin. Piped pop-country MUSIC plays over the loudspeaker system. The CADRE OF SECRET SERVICE MEN, with their distinctive metallic grey suits, sun glasses and football physiques, stands out in the CROWD. On the PLATFORM are seated an assortment of LOCAL POLITICOS as well as some PALANTINE WORKERS and ADVISERS. TOM is silently reading something on the podium, and BETSY stands on the platform steps talking with ANOTHER WORKER. TOM looks up and to his left for a moment, then returns to what he was reading. Then he returns his gaze to the upper left, watching something very closely.
TOM: Betsy, come over here a moment.
BETSY: What is it? I'm busy.
TOM: ( insistent ) Just follow me.
TOM: Look there. No, over further - get your glasses - yes, over there. Isn't that little guy the same guy that was bugging you around the office about a month ago?
BETSY: No, I don't think so. That's someone else.
TOM: Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
TRAVIS: Are you a Secret Service Man?
TRAVIS: I've seen a lot of suspicious- looking people around here today.
TRAVIS: Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there.
TRAVIS: I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
TRAVIS: I was in the Army too. And I'm good with crowds.
TRAVIS: What kind of guns do you guys use?
TRAVIS: You would, huh?
TRAVIS: My name is Henry Krinkle that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410. Got that?
TRAVIS: Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
HIPPIE HOOKER: Hey cabbie! You comin' or goin'?
PALANTINE: The time has come to put an end to the things that divide us: racism, poverty, way and to those persons who seek to divide us. Never have I seen such a group of high officials from the President to Senate leaders to Cabinet
PALANTINE: ( in distance ) . pit black against white, young against old, sow anger, disunity and suspicion and all in the name of the "good of the country." Well, their game is over. ( applause ) All their games are over. Now is the time to stand up against such foolishness, propaganda and demagoguery. Now is the time for one man to stand up and accept his neighbor, for one man to give in order that all might receive. Is unity and love of common good such a lost thing? ( reading ) Dear Father and Mother, June is the month, I remember, which brings not only your wedding anniversary, but also Father's Day and Mother's birthday. I'm sorry I can't remember the exact dates, but I hope this card will take care of all of them. I'm sorry I again can not send you my address like I promised to last year, but the sensitive nature of my work for the Army demands utmost secrecy. I know you will I am healthy and well and making lots of money. I have been going with a girl for several months and I know you would be proud if you could see her.
POLICEMAN: ( standing near window ) Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.
TRAVIS: ( penitent ) Sorry, officer.
POLICEMAN: You waiting for a fare?
TRAVIS: No, officer.
POLICEMAN: All right, move it.
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY: To a Couple Who Have Found the Perfect Combination For Marriage.
LOVE!: Underneath the word "Love!" begins TRAVIS' short message to his parents, a message which extends to the back cover of the card.
TRAVIS: ( shy ) You looking for some action?
IRIS: You looking for some action?
TRAVIS: Well.I guess so.
IRIS: ( eyeing him ) All right. ( a beat ) You see that guy over there? ( nods ) His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here. You name Sport?
TRAVIS: You name Sport?
SPORT: Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
TRAVIS: Your name Sport?
SPORT: Anything you say, officer.
TRAVIS: I'm no cop. I want some action.
SPORT: I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
TRAVIS: Take it or leave it.
SPORT: Take it or leave it.
SPORT: No, not me. There'll be an elderly gent to take the bread.
SPORT: Catch you later, Copper.
TRAVIS: I'm no cop.
SPORT: Well, if you are, it's entrapment I'm hip.
TRAVIS: I'm hip.
SPORT: Funny, you don't look hip.
IRIS: This is my room.
OLD MAN: Hey cowboy!
OLD MAN: ( motioning to TRAVIS' jacket ) The rod. ( a beat ) Gimme the rod, cowboy.
OLD MAN: This ain't Dodge City, cowboy. You don't need no piece. I'm keepin' time.
TRAVIS: Why you hang around with them A girl needs protection.
IRIS: A girl needs protection.
TRAVIS: Yeah. From the likes of them.
IRIS: ( shrugs ) It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long. ( gestures to cigarette ) That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
TRAVIS: What's your name?
IRIS: That ain't much of a name.
TRAVIS: That ain't much of a name.
IRIS: It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
TRAVIS: What's your real name?
IRIS: I don't like my real name.
TRAVIS: ( insistent ) What's your real name?
IRIS: That's a nice name.
TRAVIS: That's a nice name.
IRIS: That's what you think.
TRAVIS: Don't you remember me? Button your
IRIS: ( examining him ) Why? Who are you?
TRAVIS: I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
IRIS: You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend Sport wouldn't let you.
TRAVIS: You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend Sport wouldn't let you.
IRIS: I don't remember.
TRAVIS: It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here.
IRIS: We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
TRAVIS: ( pressured ) I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
IRIS: You want to make it like this?
TRAVIS: ( taking her by the shoulders ) Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
IRIS: Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
TRAVIS: ( exasperated ) But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
IRIS: I musta been stoned.
TRAVIS: Do they drug you?
IRIS: ( reproving ) Oh, come off it, man. Don't you want to make it? ( a beat ) Can't you make it? ( distraught ) I want to help you.
TRAVIS: Don't you want to make it? Can't you make it? I want to help you.
IRIS: Don't you want to make it? Can't you make it? I want to help you.
TRAVIS: ( distraught ) I want to help you.
IRIS: ( catching on ) You can't make it, can you? ( a beat ) I can help you.
TRAVIS: Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
IRIS: ( confused ) You can do it in my mouth.
TRAVIS: Don't you understand anything?
IRIS: You don't have to make it, mister.
TRAVIS: ( slowly ) Do you understand why I came here?
IRIS: I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
TRAVIS: Don't you want to go?
IRIS: I can leave anytime I want.
TRAVIS: But that one night?
IRIS: I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself. Well, I tried.
TRAVIS: Well, I tried.
IRIS: ( compassionate ) I understand, mister. It means something, really.
TRAVIS: ( getting up ) Can I see you again?
IRIS: That's not hard to do.
TRAVIS: No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
IRIS: Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
TRAVIS: ( thinking ) Well tomorrow noon there's a. I got a.
IRIS: Well, you want to or not?
TRAVIS: ( deciding ) O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
TOM: Oh, Iris?
IRIS: My name's Travis.
TOM: My name's Travis.
IRIS: Thank you, Travis.
TRAVIS: So long, Iris. Sweet Iris.
OLD MAN: ( holding gun ) I think this is yours, cowboy.
TRAVIS: ( restrained anger ) Here's the twenty bucks, old man. You better damn well spend it right.
OLD MAN: Come back anytime you want, cowboy. But without the rod please.
ASSISTANT: Well, at least it wasn't chicken.
PALANTINE: It wasn't? I thought it was. It tasted like chicken.
TOM: C'mon, Senator. That was a class dinner. The St. Regis is a class joint. That was veal.
PALANTINE: Was it? It sure tasted like chicken to me. Lately, everything tastes like chicken to me.
ASSISTANT: Everything? Got to watch your gut.
PALANTINE: What about it? I took 20 off before we started this thing.
ASSISTANT: And you've put ten of it back on.
PALANTINE: Ten? I don't think so. You really think so? Ten?
TOM: Those TV cameras do. I caught the rally on CBS. You looked a little I don't think I gained ten pounds.
PALANTINE: I don't think I gained ten pounds.
PALANTINE: ( weary ) Jesus Christ.
IRIS: . and after that Sport and I just started hanging out.
TRAVIS: Where is home?
IRIS: I got so many sunglasses. I couldn't live without my shades, man. I must have twelve pair of
TRAVIS: I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
IRIS: I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
TRAVIS: I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
IRIS: ( voice rising ) Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
TRAVIS: But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
IRIS: ( playfully ) Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
TRAVIS: ( ignoring her question ) Young girls are supposed to dress up, go to school, play with boys, you know, that kinda stuff.
IRIS: God, you are square.
TRAVIS: ( releasing pent-up tension ) At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
IRIS: Who's a killer?
TRAVIS: That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
IRIS: He never killed nobody. He's a I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
TRAVIS: I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
IRIS: I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
TRAVIS: He looks like a killer.
IRIS: I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air He shoots dope too.
TRAVIS: He shoots dope too.
IRIS: What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from.
TRAVIS: He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
IRIS: Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplanethat's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
TRAVIS: I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
IRIS: Why don't you come to a commune with me?
TRAVIS: Me? I could never go to a place like that.
IRIS: Why not?
TRAVIS: ( hesitant ) I. I don't get along with people like that.
IRIS: You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
TRAVIS: Besides, I've got to stay here.
IRIS: I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
TRAVIS: I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
IRIS: What's so important?
TRAVIS: I can't say it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
IRIS: You a narc?
TRAVIS: Do I look like a narc?
IRIS: TRAVIS breaks out in his big infectious grin, and IRIS joins his laughter.
IRIS: God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
TRAVIS: ( pause ) What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
IRIS: Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
TRAVIS: You just gonna leave 'em?
IRIS: ( astonished ) What should I do? Call the cops?
TRAVIS: Cops don't do nothin.
IRIS: Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
TRAVIS: You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
IRIS: ( shrugs ) I don't know. Just should, though. ( a beat ) Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
TRAVIS: ( shrugs ) I don't know. Just should, though. ( a beat ) Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
IRIS: ( taken back ) God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
TRAVIS: ( apologetic/sheepish ) I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
IRIS: You're not much with girls, are you?
TRAVIS: ( thinks ) Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
IRIS: Do you really think I should go to the commune?
TRAVIS: I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it. Sure you don't want to come with me?
IRIS: Sure you don't want to come with me?
TRAVIS: I can't. Otherwise, I would.
IRIS: I sure hate to go alone.
TRAVIS: I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
IRIS: You don't have to.
TRAVIS: I want to what else can I do with my money? You may not see me againfor a What do you mean?
IRIS: What do you mean?
TRAVIS: My work may take me out of New York.
SPORT: What's the matter, baby, don't you feel right?
IRIS: It's my stomach. I got the flu.
SPORT: Oh, baby, there ain't no flu. You know that, baby.
IRIS: Honest, Sport.
SPORT: You're just tired, baby. You just need your man. I am your man, you know. You are my woman. I wouldn't be nothing without you. I know this may not mean anything to you, baby, but sometimes I get so emotional, sometimes I think, I wish every man could have what I have now, that every woman could be loved the way I love you. I go home and I think what it would be without you, and then I thank God for you. I think to myself, man, you are so lucky. You got a woman who loves you, who needs you, a woman who keeps you strong. It's just you and me. I'm nothing without you. I can go like this for ever and ever. We can do it, baby. You and me. Just you and me.

TRAVIS: Hey, Sport. How are things?
SPORT: ( shrugs ) O.K., cowboy.
TRAVIS: ( needling him ) How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
SPORT: What's going on?
TRAVIS: I'm here to see Iris.
SPORT: TRAVIS pushes SPORT back into the dark recesses of the
SPORT: Wha ?
TRAVIS: Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
SPORT: ( beat ) Hillbilly, you'd better get your wise ass outa here and quick, or you're gonna be in trouble.
TRAVIS: ( restrained anger ) You carry a gun?
TRAVIS: Get it.
SPORT: ( submissive ) Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any ( demanding ) Show it to me.
TRAVIS: ( demanding ) Show it to me.
TRAVIS: Now suck on that.
OLD MAN: Don't kill me! Don't kill me!
IRIS: Don't kill him, Travis! Don't kill

TRAVIS: Well, I hope he wins.
BETSY: ( concerned ) How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
TRAVIS: Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up. A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
TRAVIS: Here we are.
