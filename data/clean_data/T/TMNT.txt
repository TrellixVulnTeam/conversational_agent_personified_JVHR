WOMAN VILLAGER: You monsters!
PANTERA: We appreciate the generous donation for the continued protection of your village.
PANTERA: After all, the jungle can be a very dangerous place. BAH-HAHAHAHA.
H: IGH ANGLE - As we watch the jeep from the jungle ceiling high above. as if from someone's POV. ON DRIVER - He suddenly reacts to a fallen tree on the road ahead. Slams on the brakes. Pantera is thrown around.
PANTERA: Idiota! Watch where you're going!
DRIVER SOLIDER: There's a log on the road, senor. .that wasn't there an hour ago.
PANTERA: Well, what are you waiting for?!
REMOVE IT!: ( to soldiers behind ) Cortez! Andelay!

DRIVER SOLIDER: ( softly, nervous ) D-d-dios mio.
PANTERA: What?! WHAT IS IT?!
URLY SOLDIER: Burly gets pulled backward. away from the Jeep and into. the darkness. He SCREAMS the entire way, clawing the ground. ON JEEP - Driver is freaking out now. Last Soldier is in the back. Pantera stands up in the jeep. "Last" jumps out and readies his machine gun.

T: 8 8 9 STEAM. then through a metal grate, as we find ourselves in-
MUGGER: Heh, heh. suckers.
MUGGER: The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in all-black motorcycle leathers and black-visored helmet. Scary and faceless. He quickly gains on the Mugger and GRABS him by the collar in mid-stride!
MUGGER: You crazy?! Put me down, man!
MUGGER: OW! HEY! WHAT'RE YOU-OW!! OOF!
O: 10 10
A: 10 10
MUGGER: Wh-wh-what kinda freak are you?!
MUGGER: P-p-please. Don't kill me, man.
MUGGER: Wh-wha-wha-WHAT ARE YOU DOI- AAAGH!
W: HAM! - Driver nails the dagger through the Mugger's JACKET, PINNING HIM TO THE WALL. Driver turns around to gather the purse's belongings at the mouth of the alley. fter he stops cringing, the Mugger wriggles the blade out of the wall. Driver doesn't notice as - THWIP-IP-IP! - he hurls the knife at the Driver! THUNK! It sticks in the DRIVER'S BACK! N MUGGER - His grinning eyes suddenly GO WIDE as Driver slowly turns around, UNHURT! The Mugger is trapped as Driver moves toward him. and a BOLO CHAIN drops to his side. ON WALL SHADOW - as we see a flurry of punches, kicks and throws as Driver lays a beating on the criminal who needs to be taught a lesson. An OS Police Siren chirps. MOUTH OF ALLEY - The police suddenly show up, cherries flashing. They run to FG, mouths drop.
NYPD #1: NYPD #2
NYPD #2: The Nightwatcher.
NIGHTWATCHER?": WIDER - A quieter area of the city. Broken by the squealing of the bike as Driver ( Nightwatcher ) roars in to a stop. Nightwatcher drives underneath a TRAIN BRIDGE. He takes off his helmet. Red cloth spills out. He turns around as we see-
R: Heh, heh. Nice try, chump.
APHAEL: Heh, heh. Nice try, chump.
MICHAELANGELO: Dude! They're all around me! What do I do? WHAT DO I DO?!
MICHAELANGELO: But I need back up this time, man!
BACK UP!: DONATELLO ( O.S. ) ( SIGHS )
MICHAELANGELO: ( from inside mascot head ) Okay - waita-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA!!
SCREAMING KIDS: Get him! Yeah! You suck! Hey! Awright! Take that, Turtle-dork!
MICHAELANGELO: OH-WHOA! OW! YEOW-OW-OW! WATCH IT!! HEY! NOT BELOW THE-OOOFF!! OW!!
LITTLE GIRL: ( turns and walks back ) This was the best birthday ever,
KEEEEYA!: ( turns and walks back ) This was the best birthday ever,
S: OCCER MOM ( O.S. )
MICHAELANGELO: I can only hope they're as lovely as the rugrats you got here.
MICHAELANGELO: ( through gritted teeth ) Such. angels.
SOCCER MOM: Okay! Everyone say good-bye to Cowabunga Carl! BYE!
MICHAELANGELO: ( put-on voice ) Hyuk! Cowabunga dudes! Bye!
KIDS: ON DOOR - As the door closes and Mom turns back, a green hand reaches in quickly a grabs a box of pizza. The door closes.
BYE!!!!!!: ON DOOR - As the door closes and Mom turns back, a green hand reaches in quickly a grabs a box of pizza. The door closes.
MICHAELANGELO: Yes. sir.
MICHAELANGELO: All's I'm saying Donnie is that no one would notice if YOU did one of these gigs every now and again.
MICHAELANGELO: Well, if panache is French for "punching bag", I'd have to agree with ya.
DONATELLO: Close enough. I - uh-oh-
M: ON CAR - The Man is still looking - only now really freaked out - at the fully animated Mikey head.
MICHAELANGELO: Aw nuts.
MICHAELANGELO: ( ventriloquist style ) Just get me outta here, dude.
DONATELLO: Traffic's clear eastbound for two blocks. Then hook up with route J.
ICHAELANGELO: ( ventriloquist style )
M: along with his gaining speed.
MICHAELANGELO: But this isn't just any half-pipe - it tests all of Mikey's skills in ninjitsu, extreme sports and cross-training. He jumps on and off the board to occasionally tackle obstacles with all four limbs. A fun rock n' roll sequence. Feels like Mikey is miles away from the surface world when he arrives at a seemingly DEAD END. He smiles as he reveals a BRICK DUMMY WALL that brings him to.
YEEEEEHAAAAAAWWWW!!: But this isn't just any half-pipe - it tests all of Mikey's skills in ninjitsu, extreme sports and cross-training.

Feels like Mikey is miles away from the surface world when he arrives at a seemingly DEAD END. He smiles as he reveals a BRICK DUMMY WALL that brings him to.
MICHAELANGELO: Honeeeeey! I'm hooome!
I: behind him revealing the LAIR. Breathtaking to fresh eyes. they've made this their HOME. Furniture is jury-rigged and the place is custom lit to provide the right kind of atmosphere. If we looked behind the surface detail, we'd see a mesh of wires and circuitry powering the entire lair. Donatello runs up to Mikey. Mikey robotically hands him the wad of money from the party.
DONATELLO: As Donnie walks away, Mikey LOUDLY CLEARS HIS THROAT. Don stops as Mikey holds out his hand. Don's busted - he peels off a few bills and hands Mikey his share.
MICHAELANGELO: Domo arigato, dude.
MICHAELANGELO!: Mikey springs from the couch. Snaps to obedience.
MICHAELANGELO: Yes, sensei.
SPLINTER: ( a beat ) ( thinks, then realizes ) Oh! Here ya go, Master Splinter.
P: ( thinks, then realizes ) Oh! Here ya go, Master Splinter.
MICHAELANGELO: ( thinks, then realizes ) Oh! Here ya go, Master Splinter.
SPLINTER: Ahh! Butter creme frosting!
DONATELLO: Master. No cake. You remember your last cholesterol tests.
SPLINTER: But I- -Donatello! I am your Master!
DONATELLO: Nice try, sensei. But you can still be my Master. with low
SPLINTER: He-heh. You have done well, my son.
APRIL: ( impatient mutter ) Where are you?
C: ( GROGGY ) Talk to me.
ASEY: ( GROGGY ) Talk to me.
APRIL: Hey. It's me. I'm back.
CASEY: Was that today, babe?
O: Yes. It was today that I returned to you after being in a deadly jungle for almost a month.
APRIL: Yes. It was today that I returned to you after being in a deadly jungle for almost a month.
CASEY: I'm sorry, babe. I must've-
APRIL: Forget it. I'll take a cab.
CASEY: I missed you?
CASEY: Good goin', Case.
APRIL: Howie! Get this on the truck for delivery! Let's go!
MICHAELANGELO: I'M! BORED!!!!! N DON - He's hunched over a work table, back to Mikey.
I'M! BORED!!!!!: He stands up and walks to DON'S ROOM. He opens it. It takes only one foot until the door is pushed up against piles of TECH JUNK. Mikey uses his shoulder and pushes it open. Tinkering as always. Wild inventions line the walls, some finished, some not. Some pay tribute to past TMNT adventures.
MICHAELANGELO: Don, y'ever feel like you were meant for more? To DO more? Like, I mean, sometimes I feel like.
D: MICHAELANGELO( cont'd )
ONATELLO: Oh, hi Mikey. You say something?
MICHAELANGELO: ( sighs - to himself ) Every day it's the same thing. Wake up. Birthday party gig. Drive home. Watch TV. Train. Rinse. Repeat.
DONATELLO: I know. Isn't it great?
MICHAELANGELO: Michaelangelo. Boredom is never an indicator of your surroundings. It is a reflection of your inner heart. Fill yourself with excitement on the inside. and you'll live the most rewarding life of all.
WAH!!: Michaelangelo. Boredom is never an indicator of your surroundings. It is a reflection of your inner heart. Fill yourself with excitement on the inside. and you'll live the most rewarding life of all.

S: NYC DIRT REPORTER( cont'd ) ( movie announcer voice )
MICHAELANGELO: Now THAT'S what I'm talking about! Cruising the streets, busting those who hold themselves above the law. But they aren't above HIS.
DONATELLO: Mikey, the man's practically a criminal himself. Anyone who operates without boundary or rule of law cannot be legislated and needs to be reigned in.
RAPHAEL: Whatta we talkin' about, boys? Soundin' a little too egghead fer my tastes.
PLINTER: Ah, Raphael. Your brothers and I were just discussing the vigilante Nightwatcher once again. Where have you been? You've been spending so much time away from home lately.
RAPHAEL: I joined a book a' the month club. So just what's your beef with puttin' dirtbags behind bars, Donnie? Go ahead. enlighten me.
R: Splinter watches the growing tension with concern.
R: Splinter watches the growing tension with concern.
DONATELLO: I have no problem with the incarceration of those who deserve it, but if someone like Nightwatcher has ultimate power. then who makes sure he doesn't cross the line?
MICHAELANGELO: I think he's COOL.
DONATELLO: Of course you would.
MICHAELANGELO: ( in bg, oblivious ) Keeya! HATCHAAAAAA!!
RAPHAEL: Sometimes there are lines that even the police can't cross. Someone has to be willing to do what needs to be done. And to do that, fear becomes a weapon.
DONATELLO: You are such a Neanderthal.
APHAEL: I rest my case.
S: ( SCOLDING ) Raphael! If bullying is the only way to argue your point, then perhaps you do not have much of a point to begin with.
PLINTER: ( SCOLDING ) Raphael! If bullying is the only way to argue your point, then perhaps you do not have much of a point to begin with.
APHAEL: ( gritted teeth ) Yes, sensei. ( to Mikey ) And quit touchin' my stuff.
DONATELLO: ( too-late-retort to Raph ) That was just a startle response and isn't really an indication of
DONATELLO: It's an involuntary thing your body does when stimulated like that. What? It's true.
LEONARDO: Mmm. home sweet home.
S: He tiptoes with ninjitsu precision across the floor, avoiding the potential noise-making mess below him. He sneaks to-
SPLINTER: Leo walks in and kneels in front of Splinter.
LEONARDO: I have completed my training, master. I am prepared for the next That you are, my son. You must now apply all that you have learned on your lengthy journey to your everyday life. THAT will be the most challenging training of all. plinter reaches out and hands Leonardo an ANCIENT MEDALLION.
SPLINTER: That you are, my son. You must now apply all that you have learned on your lengthy journey to your everyday life. THAT will be the most challenging training of all. plinter reaches out and hands Leonardo an ANCIENT MEDALLION.
SPLINTER: I've missed you, Leonardo.
L: eo hugs Splinter.
LEONARDO: I've missed you too, father.
SPLINTER: I'm afraid much has changed in your brothers' spirits since you have left. But now that you are home, they will finally have the ethical and warrior leadership they have been lacking. The family needs you.
LEONARDO: Heh. Yeah. I mean, yes sensei.
SPLINTER: ( to doorway ) Raphael, your brother is home.
LEONARDO: Raphael eyes Leo. and then the medallion.
RAPHAEL: Raphael eyes Leo. and then the medallion.
RAPHAEL: So. congratulations.
LEONARDO: ( awkward beat/fake yawn ) Well, I'm goin' to bed.
RAPHAEL: ( awkward beat/fake yawn ) Well, I'm goin' to bed.
RAPHAEL: Leo's home.
DONATELLO: ON MIKEY - He wakes up. A Cheese Doodle stuck to his upper snout. Really groggy.
MICHAELANGELO: But I don't WANNA pop out of the birthday cake, Mrs. Ro-
LEOOOOO!!!: Mikey flips past Donnie and slams Leo with a gripping HUG. and doesn't let go.
LEONARDO: Hey little bro! Mikey? You can let go now. um, So bored. so bored.
MICHAELANGELO: ( MUTTERING ) So bored. so bored.

His bedroom reflects it as well - large simple shapes, decorated with a modern-day tribal/tech appeal. This guy is filled with adrenaline, power and machismo.

WINTERS ASSISTANT: The board is waiting.
WINTERS: He walks to the large bay windows that overlooks the city.
WINTERS: Tell them I'm on my way down. Winters Office is an "elevator" of sorts that can ride up
W: inters' Elevator Office lowers into a balcony level building overseeing the main lobby. He walks down a stairwell and through the lobby, five Assistants following him.
INTERS: Gentlemen! Let's begin.
T: CAM PULLS BACK along the impossibly long table as DOZENS OF BOARD MEMBERS stand up. When it reaches the end, it looks as though Winters stands at the head of an ARMY AT ATTENTION.
MICHAELANGELO: Leo. what's up, bro?
LEONARDO: Just enjoying being home. hey walk past Donnie's Chop Shop room as - BOOM! - something
CONTROL!: Mikey and Leo COUGH, leave the smokey area.
LEONARDO: Say, what's up with April and Casey? I expected them to drop by after I got back.
MICHAELANGELO: We don't see much of `em anymore. April seems to be working a lot - eww - and Casey seems to be, I dunno, "different" lately. Maybe he doesn't like having to put the toilet seat down now that they've moved in together.
LEONARDO: They're living together now?
MICHAELANGELO: To be honest with ya, they're kinda buzzkills to be around.
LEONARDO: Is Casey at least still doing his hockey mask thing?
K: Dunno. Haven't noticed since The Nightwatcher has come home to roost. WOOOOHOOOOOOOO!
MICHAELANGELO: Dunno. Haven't noticed since The Nightwatcher has come home to roost. WOOOOHOOOOOOOO!
LEONARDO: "Nightwatcher"? That some new comic book you're hooked on, Mikey?
RAPHAEL: This should explain most of it. The legacy of the city's newest hero. Compliments of the fanboy over there. M
ICHAELANGELO: Joke all you want, Raphy. But train hard and eat your veggies and one day, you too can be as cool as The Nightwatcher, dude.
RAPHAEL: I can only hope, Mikey. I can only
LEONARDO: This guy could bring heat on all of us if he keeps this up. Showboating isn't a replacement for justice. it's just self-indulgence. Someone needs to talk to this thug.
ID 1: Yo, Case? Wanna be goalie?
CASEY: Nah, you know I work for a livin'. It's Star Center or nothin' else.
C: WIDER - Casey is with 5 other KIDS prepping for a game of STREET HOCKEY, using tennis balls and trash cans. Chubbier KID 2 walks by and grabs the mask himself.
KID 2: Whatever! Let's get it on!
BROOKLYN MOM: ( snapping back )
THOMAS!: Tommy's defeated. Looks at the disappointed boys.
TOMMY: Sorry dudes.
CASEY: Busted! Have fun with your mommy. .oh no.

APRIL: ( UNENTHUSED ) Heh-heh. yeah.
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Winters. April O'Neil is here.

APRIL: Hello Max.
WINTERS: Chris! How's it going?
CASEY: Actually, It's Ca-
WINTERS: ( ignoring, back to April ) So how was your trip?
APRIL: You know, the typical - corrupt government officials, double crossed by a jungle guide, all ending in a heart-pounding chase.
APRIL: But it was all worth it. I found it. The fourth General.
CASEY: Yeah-ha! The fourth General.
APRIL: ( hushed gritted teeth ) The crow-bar.
CASEY: He hands it to April as she twirls up a CROW-BAR and cracks open the front panel. INSIDE BOX POV - The light gradually breaks in, until - CREAK - the front panel falls to the floor. CLOSE ON - Winters' look. Pure wonder and admiration. He walks up to it slowly. April and Casey cautiously stay back.
WINTERS: ( SOFT ) .the gods be praised.
W: Can I ask you a question?
APRIL: Can I ask you a question?
WINTERS: ( not looking away )
Y: es. Of course.
APRIL: I've been so grateful for the opportunities you've given me lately. I'd probably be still selling antique curios if you hadn't visited my shop that day. But I have to ask. why the fascination with these particular works of art? I'd never even heard of the Legend of Yaotl until we

APRIL: Quite the story, Max. You don't think that this could be-
WINTERS: Oh no, Miss O'Neil. Like you said. just a story. inters doesn't break his stare.
WINTERS: One of the girls will pay your fee on the way out.
PRIL: Thanks. Um. goodbye. Max.
CASEY: What!? It was a boring story!
APRIL: That is so perfectly CASEY JONES. I give you opportunity. I give you the chance to become a better man. And what do you do with it?

WINTERS: Well, I guess I'm just special that
WINTERS: So down to business - aside from the other reasons for your visit to America, are you interested in my offer we discussed?
KARAI: I must confess. I still don't know exactly what we are to do for I need the finely-tuned eyes and stealth of your Foot Ninja to. monitor the city for me over the next few days.

MICHAELANGELO: You kiddin' me?! I mean, no offense Donnie, but you ain't exactly the biggest hitter on the bench.
T: Don is grinning. Observing the subtle tension.
DONATELLO: Just trust me on this one.
LEONARDO: Have you been avoiding me? Barely seen you since I got home.
RAPHAEL: I been busy.
LEONARDO: ( SARCASTIC ) I see. So. you're definitely not upset at me or anything, right?
RAPHAEL: Why'd you think that?
LEONARDO: I don't know. your brother gets to go on a world-wide training mission and you have to stay home. Might upset me too.
RAPHAEL: Are you trying to make me mad?
LEONARDO: I'm just saying, I'd understand if you were upset.
RAPHAEL: You wouldn't understand the first thing about me, daddy's boy - OOF!. hey both trip over a duct, tumbling in a ball. They stop
LEONARDO: Is that what this is about? You think Splinter likes me best?
RAPHAEL: You'd love that, wouldn't you?

ICHAELANGELO: You dudes see that up there?
MICHAELANGELO: So what now, captain?
LEONARDO: We need to come up with a plan.

MICHAELANGELO: Well, there's a good/bad news scenario for ya.
MICHAELANGELO: Good news is that there are a buncha Foot Ninja gettin' the snot kicked out of `em.
D: An interesting conundrum. Do we hold dear the value of life and help the Foot regardless of our tumultuous past?
ONATELLO: An interesting conundrum. Do we hold dear the value of life and help the Foot regardless of our tumultuous past?
MICHAELANGELO: I vote for sitting back and enjoying the show. Whaddaya say, leader boy?
RAPHAEL: Nah. We kick butt.
EONARDO: Who are YOU?!
R: The Creature immediately CHASES the boys throughout the structure, as they use all their ninja skills to avoid it, not to mention impalement on the bed of rebar below! boys have no choice but to help him. putting them in deeper The I-Beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact. The tussle begins to fall - whoomp, whoomp - down many flights of floors. Raph gets separated at one point, jumping off the side of the building to catch up, and swings himself back onto the bottom floor to await the others. SMASH! They fall into Raph's floor.
RAPHAEL: Nice of ya's ta join me.
MICHAELANGELO: The creature stops. Confused. So are the other three turtles.
YEEEAAAAARGGHHH!!!!!: The creature stops. Confused. So are the other three turtles.

Shapes start to form until we see. .LIVING VERSIONS OF THE FOUR STONE GENERALS! Sporting HIGH TECH GEAR - a mix of tech with ancient magic scrawlings. Their bodies "glow" with a red inner life, seeping through their stone cracks and piercing eyes. The Generals are all ANIMAL-THEMED - Mute and powerful Ape- themed costume ( "MONO" ), Eagle Leader ( "AGUILA" ), agile Jaguar ( "GATO" ) and the deadly snake-like female ( "SERPIENTE" ). Large.

Shapes start to form until we see. .LIVING VERSIONS OF THE FOUR STONE GENERALS! Sporting HIGH TECH GEAR - a mix of tech with ancient magic scrawlings. Their bodies "glow" with a red inner life, seeping through their stone cracks and piercing eyes. The Generals are all ANIMAL-THEMED - Mute and powerful Ape- themed costume ( "MONO" ), Eagle Leader ( "AGUILA" ), agile Jaguar ( "GATO" ) and the deadly snake-like female ( "SERPIENTE" ). Large. Imposing. Completely bad-ass. The Creature ROARS and FIGHTS to no avail.
DONATELLO: Better hit the tunnels, guys.
LEONARDO: Raph. Save it for another day.
RAPH!: Raph knows he has to go. Reluctantly he enters the sewer. The lid closes as the alley is illuminated by POLICE CHERRIES.
A: beat, then Mikey barely pops the lid open for another peek.
WINTERS: What seems to be the problem?
KARAI: The "problem" is that we were hired to merely patrol the city and report anything "strange" to you.
W: KARAI( cont'd ) ( grabs sword hilt )
INTERS: ( tosses money brick ) So, your job duties were just redefined. Congratulations on your
KARAI: We may be hired help to you, but you should never forget. we are the Foot Clan.
WINTERS: It sets the Foot off. They all grab their weapons, moving toward Winters. Karai flips forward, sword drawn and at Winters throat! .as Winters stands still. and begins to LAUGH. Slowly, the thumping of FOUR SETS OF FEET lumber out of the shadows. Reveal themselves to be THE FOUR STONE GENERALS. They flank Winters, who is just loving the theatricality of it all. The Foot Ninja leap back. Winters remains confident and unmoving. Generals SMIRK at Karai and the Foot.
WINTERS: I believe we made a deal, Karai. I expect you to honor it. You do understand "honor", don't
WINTERS: So I don't care what part of "muscle for hire" you don't understand. I hired your muscle. Now exercise the ones attached to your feet and. .get back to work.
W: a Foot Ninja. Then another to a second Ninja.
INTERS: So I will double. no, no. TRIPLE your pay for your troubles. Are we cool?
WINTERS: Are we. cool?
WINTERS: Ninjas. No sense of humor. So how did we fare?
WINTERS: ( close, quiet ) So it begins.
WINTERS: ( to General Aguila ) Were there any problems?
GENERAL AGUILA: None, my lord.
WINTERS: ( to Karai ) You see, now THAT'S a good soldier. You two should compare notes.
K: Just what is this all about?
KARAI: Just what is this all about?
WINTERS: Oh, let's call it a scavenger hunt. I now have the power and know-how, but I need the speed and stealth of an organization such as your own. Not to mention an organization that values discretion.
KARAI: But of course.
WINTERS: You see, I have nine more beasts like this that should be coming to town very soon. Thirteen in all, to be exact.
ARAI: But. why? Why here? Why now?
WINTERS: Instinct, mostly. They're animals at their core. And they recognize something familiar in the air. in the What can I say? I'm a lover of
W: we don't fully see. Glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness.
INTERS: So you go and get to know each other. And don't forget. play
KARAI: Not now. Our business will be handled at a later time.
D: After they leave, we pause for A BEAT on Winters. Quiet. Tired. Contemplative.
R: After they leave, we pause for A BEAT on Winters. Quiet. Tired. Contemplative.
C: After they leave, we pause for A BEAT on Winters. Quiet. Tired. Contemplative.
MICHAELANGELO: Dudes, did anyone get the license plate of the thing that hit us last night? Oi, my head.
DONATELLO: Was it just me, or did that creature look familiar?
RAPHAEL: We coulda taken it if you slackers woulda pitched in sooner.
LEONARDO: Fact remains, Raph, that we should have never been there in the first Well, I suppose that we shoulda let Mr. Cuddly-kins continue to spread happiness throughout the city. oh wait. HE WAS A FREAKING MONSTER TRYIN' TA KILL US!!! Good call, fearless leader.
APHAEL: Well, I suppose that we shoulda let Mr. Cuddly-kins continue to spread happiness throughout the city. oh wait. HE WAS A FREAKING MONSTER TRYIN' TA KILL US!!! Good call, fearless leader.
ONATELLO: Come to think of it, it WAS pretty strange to see the Foot too. And who was that woman?
MICHAELANGELO: I dunno, but she sure gave Leo a run for his money.
LEONARDO: ( still fighting with Raph ) This is my fault now, Raph? I'm the only one who has to be responsible!
RAPHAEL: Hey, you're the "trained master", not me.
MICHAELANGELO: ( quickly interjected )
SPLINTER: Good morning, my sons.
TURTLES: Morning, sensei.
SPLINTER: If anyone needs me, I'll be watching my stories.
S: plinter walks out. OS sound of the TV being turned on. At the table, the glare continues.
LEONARDO: NYC DIRT REPORTER ( O.S. )
RAPHAEL: NYC DIRT REPORTER ( O.S. )
SPLINTER: My sons, what-
SPLINTER: I believe you boys have some explaining to do.
M: Splinter looks at the Turtles. Busted, as we-
SPLINTER: Leonardo, I am most disappointed in you. You are the leader of your brothers. I was counting on you to bring order to the chaos of this But Master Splinter, how can I be expected to do so when Ra-
LEONARDO: But Master Splinter, how can I be expected to do so when Ra-
SPLINTER: There are no excuses when you are the Leader, my student.
SPLINTER: But the involvement of the Foot and their mysterious leader worries me.
ICHAELANGELO: I'm personally worried about a monster running around the streets of New York. But hey, that's just
RAPHAEL: We hafta go out and find who's responsible for this. There ain't no other solution.
SPLINTER: Raphael, there are better ways to use your skills in ninjitsu. Fact- gathering. Analysis. Observation. Direct contact should only be your last resort.
RAPHAEL: Wow, sounds. exciting.
LEONARDO: Save the brute vigilante junk for that Nightwing guy.
N: Raph stands and exits the room. The others stay silent as we-
LEONARDO: Raph stands and exits the room. The others stay silent as we-
O: N BIKE - Explodes out of a BACK ALLEY and into the night.
CASEY: Nah. Ever since you started with the blade weapons you, um. you kinda scare me.
APRIL: Suit yourself. Are you happy? I mean, with your life. With me.
CASEY: ( AWKWARD ) Are you happy? I mean, with your life. With me.
APRIL: ( AWKWARD ) Are you happy? I mean, with your life. With me.
CASEY: Yeah. Sure.
APRIL: They sit on that for a moment. Casey leans in for a kiss. April doesn't notice. Awkward. Casey changes his mind.
CASEY: ( walks to the window ) I'm going outside for some air.
N: Casey slips out onto the fire escape. April knows better.
N: Casey slips out onto the fire escape. April knows better.
APRIL: ( to herself ) Be safe.
BURGLAR: I'M SORRY MAN! I-I-I WON'T EVER DO IT AGAIN! I'M SORR-OOOF!
IGHTWATCHER: Funny how you jerks don't care about crossing the line `til someone else does it. all over yer HEAD!
BURGLAR: ( almost in tears )
NIGHTWATCHER: Boy, oh boy, did YOU pick the wrong night to be a criminal.
CASEY: Are you that Nightwatcher fella? A little smaller than I expected.
RAPHAEL: ( inside helmet ) Case? No way!
CASEY: ( poking Raph with bat ) I'm talkin' to you, pal. You think you own these rooftops? Well, lemme teach you a thing'r two. ( takes out bat ) Class is Pain 101. Meet your instructor. Casey Jones.
RAPHAEL: ( GRINNING ) You keep on playing with fire, little man, you might just get Raph?! Is that you?! ( scans costume ) What-what are you doing?!
CASEY: Raph?! Is that you?! What-what are you doing?!
THINKS ): Are you pretending to be.
CASEY: Why would you- So that would mean.
RAPHAEL: IN BG - The Burglar tries to get away. Casey and Raph both spy him. Look at each other. Mischievously grin as we-
RAPHAEL: I dunno, I just got tired of the "nothing". Sitting around waiting for some disaster to cross our paths. Of us battling Utroms and Triceratons or any other friggin' creature. when there was still some guy gettin' mugged 100 feet above the lair. Just didn't seem right. `Specially if we had the means to do somethin' about it.
RAPHAEL: And we did. but turns out I was the only one who was willing to do it, tho. So I just saved up, bought and tweaked a sweet bike, fitted the costume and began moonlighting.
BEAT ): Papers called me "The Nightwatcher", so I went with it.
C: "And a legend was born". So what was your handle before that?
ASEY: "And a legend was born". So what was your handle before that?
RAPHAEL: I kinda liked "The Midnight Stick with Nightwatcher, ninja boy.
CASEY: ( makes an "eww" face ) Stick with Nightwatcher, ninja boy.
RAPHAEL: Pfft. You kiddin' me? Leo's been away for, like, forever. And the other two are so wrapped up in that party business they'd never notice.
BEAT ): So what about you? How's things with April? Haven't seen ya's since you two moved in together.
CASEY: They're good. I guess. I dunno, seems like all I do lately is just make her upset. She used to laugh so much. now it's mostly just working all day, and coming home to point out how I'm a screw up. She doesn't like me doing this. And I know she's pretending to not know I'm out tonight. But she knows. And she knows I know she knows. Life just kinda got complicated suddenly. y'know?
RAPHAEL: Yer tellin' me.
CASEY: Nice to see ya, man.
RAPHAEL: Nice to see ya, man.
CASEY: Nice to see ya, man.
RAPHAEL: For old time's sake?
CASEY: What the shell.
RAPHAEL: ( DISAPPROVING ) Bro. Seriously.
CASEY: I think we lost it.
RAPHAEL: It's gotta be around here
WAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!: It's about to attack when - THUNKA-THUNKA-THUNKA - it's drilled with TRANQUILIZER DARTS from below! CHOOOM! - A grappling hook winds around its feet. The Creature struggles but is pulled down hard!
CASEY: WHAT'S GOIN' ON, RAPH?! Did I mention we ran into a monster last week?
RAPHAEL: Did I mention we ran into a monster last week?
CASEY: NO. NO, YOU KINDA FAILED TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT ONE, BUDDY!
CASEY: The freakin' FOOT?! What about the walking statues? Were you going to mention THOSE?!
RAPHAEL: Nope. Those are a first for me too. We can take `em.
CASEY: On second thought.
S: HINK! - Casey accidentally knocks a tiny piece of rock from the ledge. It falls down - CLANG! - on a garbage can lid.
R: ON GENERALS - they turn around. Look up. GENERAL GATO POV - He scans the two. Organic Earth-based.
G: ON GENERALS - they turn around. Look up. GENERAL GATO POV - He scans the two. Organic Earth-based.
ENERAL GATO: Aguila snarls and fires the tranq gun! Raph dives in front of Casey, taking the hit himself!
APHAEL: GENERAL AGUILA ( to Gato )
AAAARRGGH!!!!!: GENERAL AGUILA ( to Gato )
GENERAL AGUILA: ( to Gato )
CASEY: Not good. You ever heard of smoke pellets?
NIGHTWATCHER: You ever heard of smoke pellets?
CASEY: Hey - you're the ninja, not me!
CASEY: WHAT WERE THOSE THINGS, RAPH?!
RAPHAEL: Raphael quickly dashes left through TRAFFIC! DOWN ALLEY BEHIND THEM - BOOM BOOM BOOM - We see Gato bounding down the wall, almost in a four-legged run, occasionally jumping off walls at incredible speeds! A true jaguar. It leaps through the traffic as well.
C: UNDER A BRIDGE - Raph points up and - CHOOP! - hits a remote that lowers his MOTORCYCLE.
CASEY: What are we gonna do, Raph? WHAT
RAPHAEL: Hop on.
CASEY: Um, Raph?
ASEY: He lets out the clutch as they make the jump! WHAM! - Sparks and crucial pieces fly off the undercarriage. They both look back at Gato up and away at the top of the structure.
T: He lets out the clutch as they make the jump! WHAM! - Sparks and crucial pieces fly off the undercarriage. They both look back at Gato up and away at the top of the structure.
CASEY: SUCK ON THAT, ROCK FACE!
CASEY: Oh crap.
C: 63 63
ASEY: Okay, so it was great seein' ya again, Raph.
CASEY: Gotta get you someplace safe, pal. And then, then I need to go buy some new undies.
APRIL: Casey, I think we need to talk. I don't want- whoa.
CASEY: Could use a little. help here.
RAPHAEL: ( WEAK ) Hey April. how ya been?
M: Raph passes out as we-
ICHAELANGELO: My compliments to zee chef.
MICHAELANGELO: Anyone for dessert?
EVERYONE: ( sick of cake )
NO!!: The phone suddenly rings. Don rushes over to the jury-rigged payphone on the wall.
DONATELLO: ( face falls ) Waita-slow down April. What happened to Raph?
M: and Casey. Mikey looks around.
ICHAELANGELO: Whoa. I am in the wrong line of work. Nice pad, kids.
DONATELLO: His vital signs seem to be okay. Pupil dilation is normal.
C: ( WEAKLY ) Get the. frig offa me.
RAPHAEL: ( WEAKLY ) Get the. frig offa me.
DONATELLO: Temper is normal too. He's going to be fine. Health-wise, I mean. Otherwise, he's still the same old Raph.
DONATELLO: Some sort of stone. probably obsidian, I think.
APRIL: It can't be.
DONATELLO: What can't be, April?
CASEY: Would it help things if I said that we were being chased by a one of those statues you collected for that Winters guy?
MICHAELANGELO: I'd say that's a big ten-four.
APRIL: ( MUTTERING ) It's just a myth. a legend.
CASEY: And I suppose that bringing up the thirty-foot flying monster would probably just push this over the edge, huh?
LEONARDO: What are you talking about Casey?
CASEY: Just some story this Winters guy told us. It all started down in South America. Long before the Ashmecks and the Macaroons.
APRIL: Azteks and Mayans.
CASEY: That's what i said.
APRIL: Sit down, Jones. So there was this guy call Yaotl.
MICHAELANGELO: Well?! WHAT NEXT?!!!
APRIL: No one knows. The legend stops But it's just a legend. The micro-tech of this dart is astounding. The molybdenum is of a grade only found in a few select markets. not to mention it's current stock is going for a little more than two-grand an ounce right What? I dabble in the market.

EONARDO: So what do we have? We have someone with a lot of money.
ONATELLO: Access to technology. and the means to produce it to exact specs.
RAPHAEL: Not to mention having a keen interest in these monsters. and them four stone jokers.
DONATELLO: If you ask me, it all somehow points to Winters Corp.
LEONARDO: How do you figure that, Donnie?
DONATELLO: Hello? "Genius"? Well, that, and the fact that this part has a Winters Corporation logo on it.
EONARDO: Do you think he's trying to recreate the events from back then?
RAPHAEL: Well, what would you do with an army of monsters?
MICHAELANGELO: Well, aside from having your own wrestling league, I dunno. MAYBE
LEONARDO: Do bad guys still try to do that?
DONATELLO: Yes, however they're usually mortgage re-fi companies.
APRIL: Guys! It's a legend!
R: Is that "legend" like the ginormous freakin' hairball that attacked us?
MICHAELANGELO: Is that "legend" like the ginormous freakin' hairball that attacked us?
APHAEL: Or "legend" like the moving statues and flying creature that attacked me n' Casey?
APRIL: Okay. Fine. I'll help for now. until we prove you're all insane.
LEONARDO: Or until we prove Winters is up to something more than collecting art.
DONATELLO: I'll work with April and see if these Stars of Kikin she told us about can give us any clues.
RAPHAEL: I say we just storm the castle and face this jerk in person!
LEONARDO: Raph, that would be the worst idea yet. We hang back. Analyze. Formulate a plan, THEN storm your castle. Are we clear?
CASEY: Raph. Don't do it, man.
RAPHAEL: Yeah. whatever. - and bolts out the door.
A: 67 67
APRIL: I cleaned out my archives on ancient South America. Might have found something useful.
APRIL: A map of the stars, as recorded by an Aztec Shaman. They pinpoint the location of the Stars of Kikin. even though the names changed.
DONATELLO: For use in an Aztec calendar. So, if we can cross-reference our current star field, positioning of the Stars of Kikin and backtrack positioning based off of the Aztec
APRIL: -along with taking into account the point of origin of the first occurrence, we should know where another portal could take place. Max, what are you up to?
SPLINTER: Leonardo, time cannot be moved faster by wearing a groove in our Seriously, dude. We're all stressed. Try to chill.
MICHAELANGELO: Seriously, dude. We're all stressed. Try to chill.
LEONARDO: You're playing video games on the possible eve of Armageddon, Mikey.
MICHAELANGELO: ( INSULTED ) But I never said I was having fun.
LEONARDO: Where's Raph?
SPLINTER: Leonardo, a true leader knows the virtue of patience. and when to stop exercising it.
DONATELLO: We're almost done, Leo. You might want to go get him. If you can find him, that is.
TREASURE HUNTER: ( SINGING ) Monay, monay, monay, MONAYYYY ( really high-pitched, bad )
W: The clicking intensifies. He follows the signal for twenty feet. Drops to the ground and digs the sand.
P: The clicking intensifies. He follows the signal for twenty feet. Drops to the ground and digs the sand.

INTERS: To picking up the pieces.
WINTERS: What is it?
GENERAL AGUILA: Two creatures remain, my lord.
WINTERS: Well, by all means then. Let's finish it.
NIGHTWATCHER: Hey there little fella. All that commotion for just little ole y-
T: he creature lunges down again, but this time, Night is ready. He fights back. Like fighting with a Chihuahua hopped up on cocaine. A break in the fight. The creature has disappeared. Night knows he's there. He preps. Grabs his SMOKE PELLETS from his pocket. And waits. until. .the Demon swoops in for another attack! Mouth open, fangs bared as Night tosses the smoke pellets inside! WIDE - POOOMPH! POOOMPH! POOOMPH! The pellets explode in its mouth, sending smoke shooting out of it's nostrils, ears and eyes! It shrieks, flying out of the Diner!
A: ( victory taunting ) Yeah! That's what I thought! Don't mess with the Nightwatcher!
NIGHTWATCHER: ( victory taunting ) Yeah! That's what I thought! Don't mess with the Nightwatcher!
DINER COOK: Pl-pl-please don't hurt me!

DINER COOK: TAKE IT! JUST TAKE IT! DON'T HURT ME, PLEASE! LISTEN! I DON'T WANT YER FRIGGIN' CASH! WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME BELIEVIN' I'M A GOOD GUY?
ME, PLEASE!: LISTEN! I DON'T WANT YER FRIGGIN' CASH! WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME BELIEVIN' I'M A GOOD GUY?
NIGHTWATCHER: LISTEN! I DON'T WANT YER FRIGGIN' CASH! WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME BELIEVIN' I'M A GOOD GUY?
B: ACK IN DINER - Night slowly lays down the register. Trying to figure out his next move.
NIGHTWATCHER: This night just keeps gettin' better n' better.
H: Tense stand-off as. Night suddenly bolts out the back as Leo bolts the roof in hot pursuit!
LEONARDO: Nice try, amateur. e swings and manages to snag Nightwatcher in mid-leap!
LEONARDO: Oof! You're a heavy boy, aren't
LEONARDO: Okay, someone's been training pretty hard.
LEONARDO: I want you to know that I appreciate your intentions. But you can't change the world like this.
NIGHTWATCHER: ( to himself in helmet )
L: Oh god. He's lecturing.
EONARDO: ( now audible ) .so I'm going to give you one chance to just walk away and stop this vigilante nonsense.
NIGHTWATCHER: ( to himself in helmet ) Okay, Leo. Wanna play?
LEONARDO: What? How did you-
LEONARDO: Goodnight, dark prince.
LEONARDO: ( THINKS )
RAPHAEL: He mule kicks Leo back. Leo tumbles back, still in shock. They yell at each other through the pouring rain.
AAAAAAAAGHH!!: He mule kicks Leo back. Leo tumbles back, still in shock. They yell at each other through the pouring rain.
RAPHAEL: You're so friggin' smug! You think the world revolves around YOU, dontcha? That we couldn't POSSIBLY survive without the mighty and powerful Leonardo to guide us through our problems, HUH?!
LEONARDO: I was training! Training to be a better leader! For you! Why do you hate me for that?!
RAPHAEL: .and whoever said I wanted to be led? I shoulda gone on that and hot-tempered! And more importantly. I'm better than you.
LEONARDO: OU WEREN'T READY! You're impatient and hot-tempered! And more importantly. I'm better than you.
Y: OU WEREN'T READY! You're impatient and hot-tempered! And more importantly. I'm better than you.
RAPHAEL: Well, big brother, I'd have to disagree with you on that one.
GENERAL SERPIENTE: The final creature.
R: It ends with Raph pinning Leo to the ground. holding a sai
GENERAL GATO: It is neither monster nor human.
GENERAL AGUILA: Then he shall perfectly serve our purposes. let us inform our commander that the final creature has been captured.
RAPHAEL: Raph runs closer as the Generals lower to the ground and drive off. Raph jumps from rooftop to rooftop to try and catch his brother.
LEO!!!: Raph runs closer as the Generals lower to the ground and drive off. Raph jumps from rooftop to rooftop to try and catch his brother.
RAPHAEL: eo!!! Hang on!!
L: eo!!! Hang on!!
APHAEL: Raph gets weak and collapses to his knees on the roof. The sun begins to rise. He has to return to the sewer.
NOOOOOOOO!!!!: Raph gets weak and collapses to his knees on the roof. The sun begins to rise. He has to return to the sewer.
S: 84 84
SPLINTER: Raphael? What is the matter?
RAPHAEL: ( RANTING ) I was out, and did. something. something happened and I- ARRRGH!!!
SPLINTER: Raphael! Kneel.
RAPHAEL: I did something. I did something really stupid, Master Splinter.
SPLINTER: Go on.
RAPHAEL: ( SEMI-RAMBLING ) I know why you chose him now. I know that there's a reason why he's the better son and I'm not.
SPLINTER: Raphael. You always bear the world's problems on your shoulders. It is an admirable quality when you are a protector of others. plinter gently lays a hand on Raph's shoulder.
SPLINTER: But you must realize that while, at times, you may not be my favorite student, it does not mean that you are my least favorite son.
SPLINTER: You are strong, passionate and loyal to a fault. These are the merits of a great leader as well. but only when tempered with compassion and humility.
RAPHAEL: But Master Splinter, I messed up big tonight. I mean BIG.
SPLINTER: Leonardo? R
APHAEL: ( beat, ashamed )
SPLINTER: Well then, I believe your brothers may be in need of a leader.
RAPHAEL: Thank you. father.
MICHAELANGELO: Dudes. I think you're gonna want to check this out.
DONATELLO: So, the first time that this portal was opened, the Stars of Kikin
SCREEN ): .and that's why it occurred in that specific South American Now if we take into account the continual rotation of the Earth since then, as well as the gradual celestial shift that's happened and been recorded over. well, over the course of that mountain of books over there. we now know our new location.
APRIL: Precisely at 40.748 degrees latitude and -073.985 Degrees
DONATELLO: New York City.
APRIL: Winters Tower.
DONATELLO: And the alignment is due to occur in precisely- - well. tonight.
MICHAELANGELO: But without Leo. what do we do?
RAPHAEL: We rescue our brother. and save New York City.
SPLINTER: CUT TO:
CASEY: ( models it ) Picked it up on my last trip to Japan. You. like it?
APRIL: ( models it ) Picked it up on my last trip to Japan. You. like it?
CASEY: Oh. oh yeah.

CASEY: ( BEAT )
APRIL: That's our ride.
RAPHAEL: You know I ain't much on speeches.
ICHAELANGELO: I love you man.
RAPHAEL: Don't push it. April, this is going to be dangerous. You sure you're in?
APRIL: I feel responsible, fellas. I found the Generals for him.
O: CAM CONTINUES TO PULL OUT - as the familiar jingle of Cowabunga Carl fades in and we see the Cowabunga Carl Party
R: Van in full view.
KARAI: As ordered - no one gets in. No one interferes. No one bears witness. N MONITOR - We see CASEY standing there, obscured by a LARGE
C: May I help you?
KARAI: May I help you?
CASEY: Yeah, hey, I was supposed to drop this off for Mr. Winters. If I don't get this done, I am majorly in the doghouse. You know what I'm sayin', right? Right? AM DOLLIES OVERHEAD as we see that Casey is packing MAJOR
KARAI: Please come in, then.
CASEY: ( beat - gets composed ) I mean, "but of course".
R: Let's NEVER do this again. And who did that?!
APHAEL: Let's NEVER do this again. And who did that?!
MICHAELANGELO: What?! Why does everyone always call ME out?
SPLINTER: I apologize my sons.
CASEY: I suppose this is where we all take out our sharp and pointy things?
KARAI: You suppose correctly.
W: ON HEROES - As they all draw their weapons. HIGH ANGLE as the Foot all draw theirs. Stand-off. Raph twirls his sais.
RAPHAEL: I am SO gonna enjoy this.
APRIL: I had the situation under control.
CASEY: ( SMIRKS ) You're welcome.
APRIL: Guys! Front door is open. Now!
INTERS: ( THEN )
YESSSSSSS!!!!: The cam PULLS UP through the building. Up over NYC. Through the clouds. and into space until we pass all ALIGNED STARS.
S: PACE - The final star drifts into position. A LIGHT BURST EFFECT travels down each star, headed to Earth. BACK IN LOBBY - The light burst flies into the lobby and hits the circle in the middle of all the monsters' cells. ON CIRCLE - The pieces suddenly start to move around. Almost like a sliding puzzle. Then they start to randomly SINK further into the ground. Light pours out of them, until all of them give way to create THE PORTAL. POV OFFICE ABOVE - Each of the Thirteen Cells LIGHT UP to acknowledge their contents. 1. 2. 3.
WINTERS: Finally. finally!
WINTERS: His mind reels. Looks down at the cells. Nothing. Then it hits him like a ton of bricks. He turns to the Generals.
WINTERS: What did you do?!
MICHAELANGELO: What do we do, dudes?!
DONATELLO: I'm working on it.
RAPHAEL: We get ready for round two.
RAPHAEL: Everyone high fives Casey. Except April. She smiles.
APRIL: Nice work, Jones.
CASEY: I have my moments.
DONATELLO: OFF DON'S LOOK - the mayhem builds at the other end of the vast lobby. The cells are glowing. The portal worsens.
DONATELLO: And that would be the swirling vortex to another world, I assume.
MICHAELANGELO: Leo! Is that you?
MICHAELANGELO: I guess that would be a "no".
DONATELLO: Out of the way, please.
D: on places a small EXPLOSIVE on a key lock. Raph pulls Leo out. LIFELESS.
RAPHAEL: Hey buddy! Come on, man. Leo, please wake up!
RAPHAEL: Listen, I - I'm sorry.
SMASH!!!!: ANGLE UP - As WINTERS is thrown out the window of his elevator office! He heads straight for a sword wielding BRONZE STATUE. particularly the sword part. Closer. closer. and.
CASEY: Is he. is he dead?
MICHAELANGELO: Yup. He's WAY dead, dude.
WINTERS: ( GROANS )
WINTERS: Mister Winters. We mean you no No harm?! Whatever! I'm about to give you piercin's in places you never imagined if you don't tell us what's going on.
SPLINTER: Mister Winters. We mean you no No harm?! Whatever! I'm about to give you piercin's in places you never imagined if you don't tell us what's going on.
RAPHAEL: No harm?! Whatever! I'm about to give you piercin's in places you never imagined if you don't tell us what's going on.
O: We were so close. so close.

B: WINTERS( cont'd )
WINTERS: We were doomed to live this way until, as the Shaman put it, "you corrected the mistakes of your That's what this is about. Penance, Miss O'Neil. Finally getting a chance to right our wrongs.
GENERAL AGUILA: He fails to discuss the petrified agony of three thousand years.
GENERAL SERPIENTE: Of the torture of taking CENTURIES to merely blink an eye!
GENERAL GATO: Of watching the erosion of your own body throughout centuries.
GENERAL AGUILA: So, while our great leader basked in the warmth of the sun and the glory of fresh air. we rotted in the stone hell that lasted throughout Wmillennia.
INTERS: My brothers, I-
GENERAL AGUILA: WE ARE NO BROTHERS TO YOU! Our brotherhood was broken the day that you condemned us to this eternity.
GENERAL GATO: And now, our Master has tired of feeding on the nectar of life. Of loving his entire life. Of FEELING. So he prefers to end it all. End HIS "misery" at the expense of
GENERAL AGUILA: But thanks to his cunning, his technology, we are now capable of LIVING. we have now become- - gods.
GENERAL SERPIENTE: And we shall finish what we began all those years ago. We will finally have our victory.
GENERAL GATO: Even with one monster still free, the curse can never be broken!
GENERAL AGUILA: ( to Winters ) Join us. Join us Yaotl, and live a life eternal with us at your side!
WINTERS: Never. This was our opportunity! We were wrong! Don't you understand?!
GENERAL AGUILA: NO! YOU WERE WRONG. And you are weak.
BEAT ): And you are weak.
GENERAL AGUILA: ( to Karai ) Destroy them.
APRIL: What does THAT mean?
KARAI: It means we're going to help you.
KARAI: My soldiers will find the thirteenth monster. And you will bring it back here. Hurry - we don't have much time.
CASEY: I got shotgun!
RAPHAEL: If you mess with one of us- -you mess with all of us.

WINTERS: Alright. We have more important things to do!
WINTERS: Help me push the cells into the
CASEY: So. anybody from out of town?
W: E BEGIN TO INTERCUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE LOBBY FIGHT, AND CASEY/APRIL MONSTER CHASE. LOBBY - The combatants all pair off for their final battle. Utter commotion. Mikey is paired with Serpiente. Donnie is paired with the General Mono. He uses his quick speed and expert staff against the hammer-weilding Statue. Leo fights with Gato. He can't dodge him. He's too fast. Leo lands a lucky blow, but Gato recoils - BOOM! Leo's knocked shell-first into a large GLASS DISPLAY CASE filled with swords and bladed weapons of all kinds.
LEONARDO: Come to daddy.
C: Raph and Aguila duke it out in and around the MONSTER CELLS. It's a Jackie Chan-inspired sequence, where they have to be aware of their environment to avoid defeat.

RAPHAEL: Sensei! How you guys doing?!
SPLINTER: Wonderful, my son. WONDERFUL!
KARAI: My troops have located the final monster. At the harbor docks.
ASEY: Oh, I got this one covered.
I: NSIDE THE VAN - Everyone is in shock. The ninjas look at each other.
ASEY: Huh. Now there's somethin' you don't see every day.
CASEY: ( off of monster ) Well, I guess we have to figure out how to get handsome here back to Winters' Tower.
KARAI: We should tie it to the van and drag it back.
CASEY: Wow. You're. hard core.
CASEY: ON VAN - As they open the doors to act as shields as - THUNKA THUNK THUNK - darts stick in the door! ON CREATURE - He's now standing. and dying to chase something. It GROWLS/SCREAMS as they all pile into the van! Casey immediately throws it in reverse and starts peeling back on the pier, barely staying out of the clutches of the creature smashing the pier in front of them. Get to the end and spin the vehicle around.
APRIL: FAST! GO FAST NOW!!!
LEONARDO: They better hurry with that last I'm sure my man Casey's got it all under control.
RAPHAEL: I'm sure my man Casey's got it all under control.
LEONARDO: That's what I'm afraid of.
CASEY: I GOTTA TELL YA. I'M, UH, I'M STILL NOT SURE THAT THIS WAS THE BEST IDEA!!!!
BEST IDEA!!!!: WIDER - We see that he's on top of the Van, acting as LIVE BAIT to attract the creature! It's working too! The creature pounces along like an awkward greyhound run. April drives.
R: Casey is throwing SPORTS EQUIPMENT at it from his large hockey bag. The creature is catching and eating it all. INSIDE VAN - Casey slips in.
APRIL: What are you doing in here?!
CASEY: Ran outta food.
APHAEL: Listen. I'm the last guy to sound like a TV cartoon, but I think we need to work together.
MICHAELANGELO: Teamwork. The more you know.
LEONARDO: ( TEASING ) Why Raph, no solo act tonight?
SPLINTER: Yes. Yes, my sons.
T: So who wants ta call it a day?
RAPHAEL: So who wants ta call it a day?
LEONARDO: I'm in.
DONATELLO: Roger dodger, dude.
MICHAELANGELO: Roger dodger, dude.
SPLINTER: My sons, I am so proud of you all.
TURTLES: GENERAL AGUILA
GENERAL AGUILA: Silly children. We are immortals made of stone! The Earth has only BEGUN to feel our wrath!
WINTERS: LOOK OUT!
LOOK OUT!: Winters dives in and pushes the Turtles out of way as the Creature flies in and knocks the Generals back into the Portal! The Cloud Tendrils grab a hold of it and pull it back into the Portal! ON STARS - The Stars move out of alignment, ending the cycle. ON PORTAL - It begins to close. The Generals struggle to get out, only now, we see they are HUMAN. their curse broken. and an eternity of pain and suffering ahead of them.
GENERAL AGUILA: YOU CANNOT DEFEAT US! WE-
RAPHAEL: I thought he'd never shut up.
MICHAELANGELO: HOLY CRAP!!! WE DID IT! YEAH! WHOOHOO! WE DID IT!
HOLY CRAP!!!: WE DID IT! YEAH! WHOOHOO! WE DID IT!

APRIL: Don't try to tell me for one second that you didn't enjoy tha-
MICHAELANGELO: Raph and Leo look at each other. A beat. Then hug. Brothers again. Dialogue would just ruin this moment. Splinter walks over to them. CAM ADJUSTS to show Karai and the Foot Ninja standing there. Silence. Finally, Karai steps forward -
KARAI: You are every bit the warriors I was informed you were. You have
LEONARDO: Passed what?
RAPHAEL: You know us?
KARAI: I've known OF you for some time. Savor your victory tonight. For soon we will have further business What kind of business?
SPLINTER: What kind of business?
KARAI: The kind that involves familiar faces from your past.
RAPHAEL: She doesn't mean.
RAPHAEL: ON WINTERS - Looks like he's sobbing. They get concerned. Then the sobs turn to LAUGHING. He stands up. His hand is spotted red with his M
ICHAELANGELO: I'm never usually that happy to be You would be if you were an immortal who couldn't bleed for three thousand years.
DONATELLO: You would be if you were an immortal who couldn't bleed for three thousand years.
WINTERS: Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You've made a very old man, very very happy.
MICHAELANGELO: So, um, what happens now?
R: ON WINTERS - He just SMILES. Content. Finally at peace. As he ages thousands of years in front of us. eventually turning to DUST and blowing away.
C: ON WINTERS - He just SMILES. Content. Finally at peace. As he ages thousands of years in front of us. eventually turning to DUST and blowing away.
MICHAELANGELO: Okay. just a little bit creepy.
APHAEL: You wanted to see me Sensei?
SPLINTER: Sit down, Raphael.
RAPHAEL: Thank you, Master Splinter, for your guidance. I can only hope that one day, I will be able to begin the next stage of my training like Leo.
SPLINTER: That, my son, you already have.
L: He sits down to meditate. But first reaches into his robe and pulls out a TIN FOIL PACKAGE. He opens it up and smiles.
S: He sits down to meditate. But first reaches into his robe and pulls out a TIN FOIL PACKAGE. He opens it up and smiles.
PLINTER: Ahh. Double chocolate fudge.
RAPHAEL: So we're cool with the whole Nightwatcher thing?
LEONARDO: Yeah, we're cool. Our secret, bro. You got rid of the stuff, right?
EONARDO: What about the bike, tho?
RAPHAEL: ( discreet/confessional ) Okay, so I couldn't exactly destroy the bike.
LEONARDO: What do you mean?
RAPHAEL: I mean, it's in good hands.
LEONARDO: ( thinks, then realizes ) Oh, you didn't.
WHAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!: As Casey roars down the street on the black motorcycle of Nightwatcher, barely able to hang on.
APRIL: She wraps her arms around his waist and holds tight for the adventures that await. CAM FOLLOWS for a beat, then rises up the buildings to-
