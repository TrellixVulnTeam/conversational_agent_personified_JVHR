TOBIAS WOLFF: March 1992 Draft
FOR EDUCATIONAL: PURPOSES ONLY FADE IN: 1 EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 1 It is 1957, and we are in the deserts of Utah. TONY BENNETT sings "Rags to Riches" on the SOUNDTRACK. Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors up a hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile- per-hour pace. Two cars decide to ignore safety and cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car.
PURPOSES ONLY: THIS BOY'S LIFE
TOBY: . Well, I mean it. I'm serious I do. You promise and promise, and then you change your mind, just like that.
CAROLINE: ( totally oblivious ) . Uh-huh.
TOBY: You wait 'til you ask me for something. Just wait. See if you get it.
CAROLINE: ( as above ) Toby, hush. Let me just.
CAROLINE: What'd you say?
TOBY: I said for the twentieth time if a person promises somebody something, they can't just turn around and take it back.
CAROLINE: Oh, honey, Jesus. Don't start with that again.
TOBY: Why not?
CAROLINE: Because I'm the mother, and I get to tell you what to do every minute of your life 'til you're eighteen. Seriously, we've got no money. I can't buy you the I bet if you'd promised Roy some moccasins he'd of got 'em.
TOBY: I bet if you'd promised Roy some moccasins he'd of got 'em.
CAROLINE: No talk about Roy, okay? And ditto the moccasins. We, can't, afford, Yeah, but you did promise.
TOBY: Yeah, but you did promise.
CAROLINE: Sue me. Take me to court. Oh, Toby, I know you're disappointed, Jack. Call me Jack.
TOBY: Jack. Call me Jack.
CAROLINE: You're going to drive me to an early grave: I'm never going to make Salt Lake City.
TOBY: Seriously. If a person can't get a stinking miserable pair of moccasins, at least he ought to be able to choose his own name. . and I wanna be called Jack!
CAROLINE: Fine. And you can call me. . Jeanette. Jeanette Marie.
TOBY: Oh, you're so stupid sometimes,
CAROLINE: ( not much heat ) Goddamn thing.
CAROLINE: Oh, that poor man.
TOBY: I hope to hell this isn't some kind of omen.
TOBY: How's this thing work, anyway?
CAROLINE: ( not confident ) It makes a black light that, uh, causes uranium traces to glow.
TOBY: And we just walk along the street and find this glowing uranium?
CAROLINE: Well, it was everywhere in Moab, they say just like gold in the gold-rush days.
TOBY: But we were too late in Moab, and that guy at the office said nobody'd found any uranium in Salt Lake City.
CAROLINE: Well, that means we'll have the place pretty much to ourselves, huh? Honey, this could be a big break for us. If this works out, oh, just think: we'll get us a house, get rid of this damn Nash Ambassador no money worries. It'll be like heaven on a June day.
CAROLINE: Ask me how far we are from Salt Lake City.
CAROLINE: If I could have one wish right now only one wish you know what I'd like? I'd like to burn this damn Nash Ambassador to a I'm serious. I hate it. I hate the factory that produced it, and I hate the man who invented it.
TOBY: It almost makes me want to see Roy he was the only one could make the thing stop overheating. My God, he was boring. Boring and mean: you sure got crappy taste in
CAROLINE: I'd like to burn you to the ground. Let's go get rich in Salt Lake Toby waits beside the Nash Ambassador, looking toward a three-story concrete building. He holds a portable RADIO, which PLAYS DEAN MARTIN singing "Volare."
MAN: You're pulling my leg, right?
CAROLINE: No, I came here to look for My God, lady. If you're looking for uranium, why didn't you go to We went there, but everybody'd beaten us there. We were too late.
MAN: My God, lady. If you're looking for uranium, why didn't you go to We went there, but everybody'd beaten us there. We were too late.
CAROLINE: We went there, but everybody'd beaten us there. We were too late.
MAN: So you came here just on the chance you'd find uranium? Listen, you mind me saying something to you might sound rude? Lady, you got more courage than you got common sense.
CAROLINE: Don't ask.
TOBY: That mechanic in Colorado said it needed points.
CAROLINE: I know. Don't tell me what I already know. This thing's a bottomless pit. I don't know what to do. No matter how much money I pour into it. I'd rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble. 'Course these days I don't have to worry about that. My husband got laid off at the mill, and they repossessed the car, so wherever I wanna go, I just have to hoof it, you know?
WOMAN: I'd rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble. 'Course these days I don't have to worry about that. My husband got laid off at the mill, and they repossessed the car, so wherever I wanna go, I just have to hoof it, you know?
CAROLINE: You don't have a car? You want this one?
WOMAN: I. uh. I.
TOBY: You're gonna give our car away?
CAROLINE: ( to the Woman ) Seriously. It needs points, and it overheats constantly, but you can have it if you want it, because my hand to God, I can't look at it one more minute.
WOMAN: Well, sure.
CAROLINE: Get the bags out. Get the owner's slip out of the glove compartment. We're rid of this son-of-a-bitch pink and white albatross. You don't mind taking a car with a big dent in the passenger door?
WOMAN: Hell, no. There's no dent there.
CAROLINE: Oh, yes there is!
WOMAN: . you really just giving me this It's done. It's yours. You got yourself a Nash Ambassador! Let's go!
CAROLINE: It's done. It's yours. You got yourself a Nash Ambassador! Let's go!
CAROLINE: . find ourselves a cheap room someplace, we'll get you into school, I'll brush up on my typing and get a job, and things'll start looking up. I feel it: the good times are coming. And at least we're rid of that damn Nash Yeah, and like Dad used to say, 'We may be broke, but we're never poor.' And later, if we get a house with a big yard, I could get a collie, you know? One like Lad or Grey Dawn. And someday maybe a palomino. And I'm going to try harder in school, too.
TOBY: Yeah, and like Dad used to say, 'We may be broke, but we're never poor.' And later, if we get a house with a big yard, I could get a collie, you know? One like Lad or Grey Dawn. And someday maybe a palomino. And I'm going to try harder in school, too.
VICE PRINCIPAL: . like to give new boys the benefit of the doubt, but this is the second time in two weeks that you've been in front of me, and I don't like that. Now I think you better just call your mother and tell her to come down here.
TOBY: She works. She's working.
TOBY: It wasn't me broke their stupid Gee, thanks a lot, Mom believe them instead of me.
CAROLINE: Gee, thanks a lot, Mom believe them instead of me.
TOBY: Gee, thanks a lot, Mom believe them instead of me.
CAROLINE: If you care anything about me at all, you'll shut up.
TOBY: Yeah, well if you'd stayed married to Dad none of this would've ever Look, don't you put that on my back: I can't make your father call you. I can't make your brother write you. They dumped you. Yes. But it's not my fault.
CAROLINE: Look, don't you put that on my back: I can't make your father call you. I can't make your brother write you. They dumped you. Yes. But it's not my fault.
CAROLINE: My head is killing me.
CAROLINE: What time is it?
TOBY: Seven. Almost.
CAROLINE: Why didn't you wake me?
TOBY: I started dinner. The potatoes are frying, and I'm heating up the hot dogs.
CAROLINE: Hold your mother's hand.
TOBY: I'm sorry.
CAROLINE: I know you are, honey. Ah, well it wasn't fire, and nobody bled, so I guess we're okay.
CAROLINE: ( listens ) ( listens ) Yes, I know. ( listens ) You're right. ( listens ) All right, yes. in an hour,
TOBY: Who was that?
TOBY: Who was that?
CAROLINE: We've got a guest for dinner: it's Roy. He tracked us down.
ROY: . I found me a room, but it's clear the hell and gone 'cross town. And I think I got a job lined up doin' tune-ups in a Texaco station. How you like it at Winstead's?
CAROLINE: How do you know where I work?
ROY: I been here almost a week.
CAROLINE: You followed me around? For a week? Watching?
CAROLINE: And how did you ever find me?
ROY: You like the rifle, Toby? 'Jack,' I mean.
TOBY: It's the best present I ever got. I just love it. I'm going to pretend I'm shooting.
CAROLINE: Don't point that thing at anybody or I won't teach you to shoot.
TOBY: It's not loaded!
CAROLINE: You heard me: anybody or any It's got no bullets, for God's Don't make me speak to you again.
TOBY: It's got no bullets, for God's Don't make me speak to you again.
CAROLINE: Don't make me speak to you again.
TOBY: I'll point it at the sky, then.
CAROLINE: Don't. Toby's still up.
ROY: You are one sweet thing, baby: just the sight of you makes my dick hard. Aw, he won't hear anything.
ROY: Aw, he won't hear anything.
ROY: Shit, baby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I'm just so glad to see you.
WOMAN #1: The Woman stops to take a breather, lights a cigarette, pokes her companion.
TOBY: The Woman stops to take a breather, lights a cigarette, pokes her companion.
WOMAN #1: My Lord, look at the eyes on him won't he be a heartbreaker in three, four years?

WOMAN #1: Oh, yes?
TOBY: Yeah. I'm gonna live on his ranch in Phoenix. The "Lazy B," it's called.
WOMAN #2: That sounds like fun.
TOBY: It is. I've got a palomino horse and a collie, and Dad lets us go on hunts all by ourselves. He gave me this Winchester .22, and last year I shot a mountain lion with it. And Lad that's my dog found a nest of rattlesnakes one time, and killed all twelve of them.
TOBY: What're you doing home so We going someplace?
CAROLINE: We sure are.
TOBY: I don't know. Got any suggestions?
CAROLINE: I don't know. Got any suggestions?
TOBY: Good. I was thinking of Phoenix or Seattle lots of opportunities in both those places.
CAROLINE: Good. I was thinking of Phoenix or Seattle lots of opportunities in both those places.
TOBY: What about your fabulous boyfriends? What about the fabulous, boring Roy? Is he coming, too?
CAROLINE: Not if I can help it. I looked out the window at work today, and he was parked across the street, Roy's so uncool. So boring.
TOBY: Roy's so uncool. So boring.
CAROLINE: You liked him well enough last 'Oh, Roy, I just love my rifle so much! It's the bestest present Oh, shut up.
TOBY: Oh, shut up.
TOBY: Now? We're going now? What about all the food?

TOBY: Well, ask him when the next one to Phoenix is.
TICKET SELLER: Tomorrow morning, eleven
CAROLINE: What about Seattle?
TICKET SELLER: ( consults a list ) Leaves in nine minutes.
CAROLINE: . I've always had a good head for figures, and if I could get my C.P.A. license, I believe we could make a real go of it in Seattle. I'll advertise for roommates, and I bet we find us a real cute house to rent.
TOBY: If there's a big yard, can I get a collie?
CAROLINE: Sure. Oh, honey, I feel a wind at my back: I think this is going to work out good.
TOBY: ( as they board Yeah like heaven on a June day.
TOBY: Hey, Terry.
TERRY TAYLOR: Hey, Jack. What'd your mom say about skipping school today?

MARIAN: And you say he's getting serious Yes, I think. He keeps talking about marriage, keeps saying he wants to meet Toby.
CAROLINE: Yes, I think. He keeps talking about marriage, keeps saying he wants to meet Toby.
MARIAN: Well, that's it three dates and you got 'im good.
CAROLINE: I don't know if I want him
TOBY: Don't want who?
KATHY: ( about Toby ) Little pitchers.
MARIAN: Well, it's the tough guy who can't be bothered to go to school.
CAROLINE: ( to Toby ) Oh, it's nothing we were talking about Dwight. I told you about Dwight.
TOBY: He the one drives down from the boondocks? The mechanic? Dwight. What a stupid name. Dwiiiight. Duhhhhwight. Dwight-tah-h-h-h. Dwighttahhhhh.
CAROLINE: Would you like coffee before we go? Or a Coke?
DWIGHT: You know, I believe I could stand a cup of java.
DWIGHT: So you're Toby.
TOBY: You're not Toby?
DWIGHT: You're not Toby?
TOBY: Oh, he wants to be called 'Jack.' It's so silly. ever since he read Jack London.
CAROLINE: Oh, he wants to be called 'Jack.' It's so silly. ever since he read Jack London.
DWIGHT: Well, I'll call him anything he I always say people can call me anything they want, long as they don't call me late for supper!
DWIGHT: So, Jack, you like school?
TOBY: He might like it if he ever went there and tried it.
MARIAN: He might like it if he ever went there and tried it.
TOBY: Oh, have another cookie, Marian keep your strength up.
MARIAN: I'd like to just yank that nasty tongue of yours out by the roots.
CAROLINE: ( to Dwight, light ) My son's decided to try to drive me into an early grave. Truly.
DWIGHT: Who made this?
CAROLINE: I did.
DWIGHT: Well, well, well, all I can say is that you people are pretty lucky to live in a house where oh. I hear you're invited up to Dwight's next week for Aw, you'll love it. Great air, great water. For scenery, all you have to do is step outside your front door and open your eyes. And there's a turkey shoot Thanksgiving Day. Your mom said you might like it, so I signed you
KATHY: I hear you're invited up to Dwight's next week for Aw, you'll love it. Great air, great water. For scenery, all you have to do is step outside your front door and open your eyes. And there's a turkey shoot Thanksgiving Day. Your mom said you might like it, so I signed you
DWIGHT: Aw, you'll love it. Great air, great water. For scenery, all you have to do is step outside your front door and open your eyes. And there's a turkey shoot Thanksgiving Day. Your mom said you might like it, so I signed you
TOBY: Really? I can shoot my Winchester? Great! I bet I could be the one to get the turkey.
CAROLINE: Well, amazing: it can sit up and talk like a normal human being. Dwight, we're going to be late.
CAROLINE: I want you to be polite to Dwight this weekend.
TOBY: ( buck-toothed speech ) I mean it, now.
CAROLINE: I mean it, now.
TOBY: ( buck-toothed speech ) I said 'Okay,' didn't I?
CAROLINE: Hey, c'mon, maybe the weekend'll be fun. maybe Concrete will be Oh, Concrete, my favorite town. Welcome to beautiful Concrete!
TOBY: ( buck-toothed speech ) Oh, Concrete, my favorite town. Welcome to beautiful Concrete!
CAROLINE: And stop that.
TOBY: ( buck-toothed speech ) Stop what?
CAROLINE: Sometimes I could kill you as free as I could eat a bite.
TOBY: ( buck-toothed speech )
CAROLINE: Please be nice.
TOBY: All right.
DWIGHT: They always show you salmon fighting to get upstream, but they never show you what they look like when they get there.
CAROLINE: It's pitiful. Awful.
DWIGHT: They'll spawn, and then they'll die. They're dying now.
TOBY: I hope to hell it's not an omen.
DWIGHT: So here we go. Welcome to Concrete. Dwight's home sweet home. Finest people in the whole state of Washington, you ask me. Lots of churches, too. A neighbor of mine says, "Looking for nice churches, come to Concrete. Looking for sin, go to hell." I think that's funny.
DWIGHT: All the houses are converted Army barracks, made into duplexes
DWIGHT: Well. Let's see here. Kids, this is my pretty friend, Caroline Wolff, and her boy To.
DWIGHT: Okay, so that was the living room; over here is the kitchen I plan on getting all new fixtures in here and down that hall are the three bedrooms and the bath.
DWIGHT: This is sort of a lounging area. You know, just in case you want
DWIGHT: . lounge.
DWIGHT: ( about a gas station ) And over there's where I work.
CAROLINE: ( to Skipper and Norma ) How about you guys? You like it
NORMA: It's a little isolated, is all.
DWIGHT: Not that isolated.
NORMA: Well, maybe not that isolated. Pretty isolated, though.
DWIGHT: Aw, there's plenty to do in Concrete if you kids would take a little initiative. When I was growing up we didn't have T.V. we used our imaginations. We read the classics. We played musical instruments. You show me a bored kid, I'll show you a lazy kid.
CAROLINE: I didn't know you played an instrument, Dwight. What do you Sax. Tenor sax.
DWIGHT: ( one-half second's Sax. Tenor sax.
CAROLINE: ( back to Skipper and How's the school here?
SKIPPER: There isn't one. We go to Chinook High.
NORMA: Chinook High.
DWIGHT: It's a few miles downriver.
SKIPPER: Forty miles.
DWIGHT: Come off it it's not that far.
SKIPPER: Yeah, I clocked it: thirty-nine
DWIGHT: Ah, you'd bellyache if the goddam school was in your fugging back yard. Just shut your god- damn pie-hole.
PEARL: I'm in fifth grade.
DWIGHT: 'Turkey shoot' is just a figure of There's no real turkey?
TOBY: There's no real turkey?
DWIGHT: No, it's just regulation paper targets. It's a test of skill. And, Jack, I just found out yesterday that they won't let kids shoot.
TOBY: But you said I could!
DWIGHT: I know, but they got it all screwed up somehow and told me wrong at first.
CAROLINE: Dwight, you did tell him.
DWIGHT: ( an edge ) I don't make the rules, Caroline. If I made the rules, I might make different ones, but I don't make the rules.
CAROLINE: Wolff. Caroline Wolff.
MAN: You mean you want to enter? I think it's against the rules.
CAROLINE: Well, that sign says this is an N.R.A. club, and I'm a dues-paying N.R.A. member. That gives me the right to participate in the activities of other chapters.
MAN: You'll be the only woman shooting.
MAN: That second-place trophy ain't bad, honey.
CAROLINE: ( big smile ) Then you won't feel too bad about carrying it home, will you?
CAROLINE: That was for you, honey.
TOBY: ( impressed ) I didn't know you were a member of the N.R.A.
CAROLINE: I'm a little behind in my dues Thirty-six years behind.
NORMA: What gives?
TOBY: Mom won the turkey shoot.
NORMA: Oh, boy. Now we're in for it he thinks he's some kind of big Well, he killed a deer once.
PEARL: Well, he killed a deer once.
NORMA: That was with the car.
DWIGHT: I got just one thing to say. I'm sitting at the table with the best damn shot in the county!
CAROLINE: So what do you think?
TOBY: They're okay. What's that bald spot on Pearl's head? Ugh.
CAROLINE: Some sort of infection.
TOBY: Norma's nice.
CAROLINE: They're all nice, but Dwight keeps rushing me, keeps talking about marriage. And I don't really want to get married not now anyway.
TOBY: That's fine with me. I wish you would've stayed married to Dad.
CAROLINE: Oh, don't wish Duke back on me. That woman he married? Is she really rich?
TOBY: That woman he married? Is she really rich?
CAROLINE: Like King Midas. Okay, look, we'll go back to Seattle and see how things go. I've been thinking about taking a course in stenotyping. A court reporter's pay is real high. Kathy got engaged, so either I find us another roommate or I've got to make some more money. And this stenotyping thing sounds just right. This could turn out good,
TOBY: I mean I blew it off, man I blew his fuckin' turkey's head
TERRY TAYLOR: With a .22.
TOBY: Fuckin' A. Winchester .22. Pump.
TERRY TAYLOR: Wolff, you are so full of shit.
TOBY: Don't believe me see if I care.
TERRY TAYLOR: All a .22 bullet would do is make a hole in his head.
TOBY: One bullet, maybe.
TERRY TAYLOR: Oh. Oh, I see you hit the turkey more than once. While he was flying. In the head.
KATHY: . exactly what I wanted for my dress. It's a Simplicity pattern, and I'm pretty sure I can make it myself. It's got big puff
TOBY: Toby grabs Caroline's lighter, and begins to imitate Dwight: saying, "Oh!" and "Oh, yes!" and Oh, my!" and "Here, let me!" and "I'll do that!" It's a mean, accurate imitation of Dwight. All three women laugh in spite of themselves. Caroline keeps saying "Jack, that's enough," and Marian says, "Dwight's not that bad." But they can't help laughing. Toby offers the other two women a light, then offers a broom, the back door, and the refrigerator a light.
CAROLINE: What did he do?
MR. SHIPPY: He violated the school property and flouted the law.
CAROLINE: Can you say that in English?
MR. SHIPPY: He wrote obscene words on the Did you do it? He didn't do it.
CAROLINE: ( to Toby ) Did you do it? ( as he shakes his He didn't do it.
MR. SHIPPY: ( strong ) He wrote obscene words on the wall.
CAROLINE: What obscene words?
MR. SHIPPY: ( after a beat ) 'Fuck you.'
CAROLINE: That's one obscene word.
MR. SHIPPY: Look, Mrs. Wolff, Jack's teachers, like him but they think he's fallen in with the wrong kind of friends. Is that nicotine stain on your I hope not. Let me tell you a story: I started smoking in college. Two packs a day. I ate One night I went to have a cigarette and lo and behold, the pack was empty. I went downstairs and started to rummage through the garbage cans. But as I reached down I mean, right down into a garbage can I suddenly thought, 'Whoa. Hold on right there, Buster.' I went back to my room and to this day I haven't smoked another cigarette.
MR. SHIPPY: Well, back to the point: I think two weeks' suspension.
CAROLINE: So what shall we do?
TOBY: What do you mean?
CAROLINE: Ever since Duke and I got divorced, you're a different boy. I know he never calls you and I could kill him for it but that's how Duke is. And Gregory's in Princeton now, so I guess. So what shall we do? Because this isn't working. We barely have enough money, Kathy's moving out, and on top of it all, you've gone wild. You No I don'.
TOBY: No I don'.
CAROLINE: Yes, you do. You steal from Marian's purse I just can't handle you anymore, and it scares me. I don't know what to do. So, you tell me what to do.
TOBY: ( he means it ) I can be better. I will be. ( it bursts out of And I hate the way I am anymore! I don't know why I do it! ( a beat ) What about that stenotyping thing you were gonna do?
CAROLINE: It won't happen. It won't happen. It won't happen. Things aren't going to turn out well, things aren't going to start looking up, and it's never going to be like heaven on a June day. There is no uranium. There is no stenotyping. There is no C.P.A. license. There isn't.
CAROLINE: . I talked to Dwight: after Christmas, he wants you to come up to Concrete and live with him for a few months go to school What are you going to do, just give me away to him?
TOBY: What are you going to do, just give me away to him?
CAROLINE: If you two can get along, if it works out, then I guess he and I might get married.
CAROLINE: I can't think of anything else to do. But first I want your
TOBY: All right.
CAROLINE: I put in both your sweaters. You wear them now, the nights are so chilly up there.
TOBY: Okay. I will.
CAROLINE: You don't have to go if you don't want to, honey.
TOBY: No, it's okay. I'll go.
TOBY: Hey, look: is that a raccoon or a beaver.
DWIGHT: Go get it the pelt's worth fifty bucks, minimum.
TOBY: That thing's probably got rabies.
DWIGHT: ( low ) Get it!
TOBY: I'm a little sick to my stomach.
DWIGHT: Sick to your stomach? A hotshot like you?
TOBY: I'm not a hotshot.
DWIGHT: That's what I hear. I hear you're a real hotshot. Come and go where you please, do what you please. Isn't that right? Yeah, regular man about town. Performer, too. That right, Jack? You a performer?
TOBY: No, sir.
DWIGHT: That's a goddamned lie. If there's one thing I can't stomach, it's a liar.
DWIGHT: If there's one thing I can't stomach, it's a liar.
TOBY: I'm not a liar.
DWIGHT: Sure you are. You or Marian. Is Marian a liar? She says you're quite the little performer. Is that a lie? You tell me that's a lie and we'll drive back to Seattle so you can call her a liar to her face. You want me to do that?
TOBY: Then you must be the one's a liar, And you're a performer?
DWIGHT: Then you must be the one's a liar, And you're a performer?
TOBY: I guess.
DWIGHT: You guess? You guess? Let's see your act. Go on. Do your act. I'm waiting.
TOBY: I can't.
DWIGHT: Sure you can.
TOBY: No, sir.
DWIGHT: Do me. I hear you do me.
DWIGHT: Yeah, I hear you're good at doing me. Here. Do me with the lighter. Go on. Take it.
DWIGHT: Hotshot. You pull that hotshot stuff around me and I'll break every bone in your body. You understand me? You're in for a change, mister. You got that? Huh? You got that You're in for a whole 'nother
DWIGHT: Skipper, go get that washtub out back, and Pearl, bring the hose around and fill it up. Hotshot and me hit a beaver. We'll salt him down.
DWIGHT: I know you think you're better than me. Caroline told me all about your rich daddy and your prep-school brother, but your fancy days are over: you're a Concrete boy now. I'm gonna give you a big injection of Concrete. That's right inoculate you. Oh, my, yes. You're gonna find out that in Concrete we have to be able to do more than sing Fats Domino songs, we work.
NORMA: You'll be in Miss Graham's class?
TOBY: Yeah, is she nice?
NORMA: She's okay. She's pretty.
TOBY: I hate changing schools.
DWIGHT: Speaking of changing, I had a talk with Jack on the way up here, and he says he wants to be a better boy. And that's good, 'cause things weren't going well for him in Seattle: the police actually came to his house to talk to Caroline about him. Uh-huh, the So here's what I think: I think idle hands are the devil's workshop, and so I found our Jack a little something to do. I picked up two barrels of horse- chestnuts in the park. You can spend your evenings hulling 'em. And I enrolled you in the Boy Scouts, and you've got a paper route, starting Monday, every afternoon from three to six-thirty pays fifty-five bucks a month. What d'you say?
PEARL: ( very low; to Toby ) So here's what I think: I think idle hands are the devil's workshop, and so I found our Jack a little something to do. ( to Toby ) I picked up two barrels of horse- chestnuts in the park. You can spend your evenings hulling 'em. And I enrolled you in the Boy Scouts, and you've got a paper route, starting Monday, every afternoon from three to six-thirty pays fifty-five bucks a month. What d'you say?
DWIGHT: So here's what I think: I think idle hands are the devil's workshop, and so I found our Jack a little something to do. I picked up two barrels of horse- chestnuts in the park. You can spend your evenings hulling 'em. And I enrolled you in the Boy Scouts, and you've got a paper route, starting Monday, every afternoon from three to six-thirty pays fifty-five bucks a month. What d'you say?
TOBY: I'll do it. I want to be. better.
DWIGHT: That's what I like to hear. Okay, you guys get these dishes cleaned up. Let's show Jack how we do it in Concrete.
MISS GRAHAM: ( reading ) 'Of course I prayed and did God care? He cared as much as on the air a bird had stamped her foot and cried, "Give me".' Now. What is the tone of this short poem?
GIRL: Is it religious?
MISS GRAHAM: No even though it talks about God, I wouldn't say it was It's sad.
BOY: It's sad.
MISS GRAHAM: Well, closer, maybe. But no.
MISS GRAHAM: It's angry, sort of bitter.
TOBY: It's angry, sort of bitter.
MISS GRAHAM: Very good, Jack. Bull's-eye.
DWIGHT: . 'cause I don't believe that crap, you know? I believe there is such a thing as a bad boy bad clear through. And it's gonna be my job to turn you around, to kill or cure. Kill. Or. Cure. Understand? And I'm up to the job, oh yes, believe me, hotshot, I am ready, willing and able to take you on you and that jibagoo music you like to sing. I'm just the guy to knock that music out of your head and put in some respect and obedience. Now your mother has just about washed her hands of you that's obvious, 'cause she's shipped you off up here. I mean, she has had it with you. She told me: she said 'Dwight, I just can't handle him anymore.' So don't go crying to Mama, 'cause Mama won't listen. Mama is sick to death of her baby And your rich Daddy Warbucks and your Princeton brother don't give a shit about you, 'cause Caroline told me they haven't even written in over two years. So it looks like I'm all you got now it's just you and me. Feels sort of inevitable, doesn't it, hotshot? It's like we were fated for each other, like I'm the one guy on Earth could set you straight. And don't you ever think I won't enjoy doing it, 'cause.
NORMA: You remind me of that boy in the fairy tale who had to spend twenty years sifting sand to find a golden needle. Remember that one? Toby doesn't answer. The two girls move away. Toby sighs, and picks up another chestnut. sure he's unobserved, reaches under the mattress of Skipper's bed and pulls out several billfold-sized black and white pornographic photographs. The hair styles of the women in them are decades old. Toby takes the photographs into the bathroom, shutting the door behind him.
PEARL: That's no fair. You make me sick. I don't know why you have to live here, anyway. Daddy says we should think of it like you were a charity kid.
TOBY: Wanna comb your hair, Pearl?
TOBY: Probably you do, since you've got such pretty hair. I know if I had hair as pretty as yours, Pearl, I'd comb it all the time.
PEARL: We're gonna have snowcream!
DWIGHT: . heard there was a fresh snow this morning, so I drove up to the mountains. I stopped in a field where it was all clean. I was finished packing it up high when somebody said. This's private property, in case you're interested. I turned around and there was this Yechh! Ugliest woman I ever saw ugly as a madman's ass she was. And frowning on top of it.
NORMA: Oh, Daddy!
DWIGHT: She was!
TOBY: ( to Pearl; soft; You're ugly as a madman's ass.
PEARL: No, you are.
SKIPPER: What'd you say to the ugly woman?
DWIGHT: I didn't say nothin' I ran.
DWIGHT: I'm gonna get you a Scout uniform, Can I join the Girl Scouts?
TOBY: ( surprised, pleased ) Can I join the Girl Scouts?
PEARL: Can I join the Girl Scouts?
DWIGHT: I'm getting one for me, too. Don't believe in doing anything halfway. If you're serious about the Scouts. . then I want you to do it right. We'll do it right together.
DWIGHT: I got you a subscription to this. I'll take the price out of your paper route money.
TOBY: Boy's Life?
DWIGHT: It's the official Scout magazine. Tells about what it means to be a Scout, what kind of boy you need to be, and, oh, about merit badges and stuff like that.
TOBY: 'Suggested good turns a Scout can do: assist a foreign boy with some English grammar. Help put out a burning field. Give water to a crippled dog.' I could do Hell, yes, you could. You're a bright kid. I want this Scout thing done right, okay?
DWIGHT: Hell, yes, you could. You're a bright kid. I want this Scout thing done right, okay?
TOBY: I'm not going.
TOBY: I'm not. Cut down Skipper's old stuff, and he's twice as big as me I'm gonna stay home.
DWIGHT: ( to Pearl ) Shut your pie-hole. ( to Toby ) You look fine.
TOBY: I look like an idiot.
DWIGHT: You act like an idiot, you look You said you'd get me a new I said I'd try to get you a new uniform. Beside, this one is new new to you.
TOBY: You said you'd get me a new I said I'd try to get you a new uniform. Beside, this one is new new to you.
DWIGHT: I said I'd try to get you a new uniform. Beside, this one is new new to you.
TOBY: But look at the sleeves and how it hangs down between my legs!
DWIGHT: Oh piss and moan all you can do is piss and moan.
TOBY: Yeah, piss and moan I notice you're all jazzed up in new stuff.
DWIGHT: They didn't have second-hand uniforms in my size.
TOBY: Oh, yeah, pull the other leg, it's got bells on it!
DWIGHT: And what're you gonna tell Caroline this weekend? You gonna say you wouldn't join the Scouts because. him didn't wike his widdle uniform?
DWIGHT: 'No boy given over to dissipation or negativity can stand the gaff. He quickly tires and gives up. He is the type who usually lacks courage at the crucial moment. He cannot take punishment and come back smiling.'
TOBY: All right, but this stinks.
DWIGHT: Hotshot, you don't know it yet, but me and Concrete are in your blood. We're going to make a man of you yet and in years to come you'll thank me. You'll remember me. Me and Concrete.
CAROLINE: Oh, I missed you!
TOBY: Me, too.
CAROLINE: You look good. How are you?
TOBY: I'm okay. I'm fine.
CAROLINE: I said to hell with the budget and bought a roast. I made dumplings God, what's wrong with your hands?
TOBY: It's just juice from some chestnuts it'll wear off.
CAROLINE: I hope so. My, your hair's short.
MARIAN: ( to Dwight ) Well, it's done him a world of good to be up there with you.
DWIGHT: Oh, we have us some pretty good times. Don't we, Jack? Have us some good times?
DWIGHT: We go to the Scouts together every week. He's got a good start already on merit badges.
CAROLINE: How is it in Concrete?
TOBY: It's fine.
CAROLINE: School's school. My grades are You haven't been in any trouble? Good. How're you and Dwight?
TOBY: School's school. My grades are You haven't been in any trouble? Good. How're you and Dwight?
CAROLINE: You haven't been in any trouble? Good. How're you and Dwight?
TOBY: He made us all snowcream, like he Stop that, honey.
CAROLINE: Stop that, honey.
TOBY: ( stops walking ) Well, you've got your eyes out of focus. Look at me. Now, are things all right?
CAROLINE: ( stops walking ) Well, you've got your eyes out of focus. Look at me. Now, are things all right?
TOBY: I'm fine.
CAROLINE: You swear? You act odd.
TOBY: No, I'm fine.
CAROLINE: Well, good. I'd feel awful if it hadn't worked out.
CAROLINE: I told Dwight I'd marry him. In two weeks. I don't know what else to do. I mean, he's been helping me with the rent since Kathy left. And you need a father. I think it's the best thing all the way around what d'you think?
TOBY: I think it's the best thing.
CAROLINE: I think it's the best thing, too.
TOBY: He makes another sign.
TOBY: He makes another sign.
TOBY: He makes another sign.
TOBY: Great mystery.
TOBY: He stares silently at himself in the mirror.
DWIGHT: Now that's a song. Not all this Elvis Presley shit. Elvis sings about like I do brain surgery.
DWIGHT: '. uh-huh-huh, my blue suede Let's get this place ready for
DWIGHT: Let's get this place ready for
TOBY: It's so white.
DWIGHT: I got a good deal on this paint. It'll darken up when it dries.
DWIGHT: What? I like it. It looks clean.
TOBY: Yeah, but it makes everything else look so dark.
MONTAGE: 65 A ) SAME SCENE - LATER 65
DWIGHT: Sort of stands out, doesn't it?
TOBY: Yeah, you could say that.
CAROLINE: Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. don't know what's the matter with me. you're right. it does look
DWIGHT: M-m-m. There's not a straight line on you everything's
CAROLINE: Oh, Dwight, not like that. Not this time not tonight.
DWIGHT: It's good this way.
CAROLINE: But I want to see your face while we make love.
DWIGHT: ( uncomfortable laugh ) Oh, no I just don't. uh. like that way.
CAROLINE: You mean you don't like to make love face to face?
DWIGHT: ( same laugh ) No, I don't like it. I can't handle it I don't like to see the face.
CAROLINE: You mean ever?
CAROLINE: But that's grotesque.
DWIGHT: ( stung; flares up ) Look, you can get it doggie-style or you can get it laying on your side those are your only choices. This is my house, and I get to say. Wherever McGinty sits is the head of the table, you
NORMA: Happy Wedding Breakfast!
TOBY: So how's the bride?
CAROLINE: The bride doesn't want to chat?
TOBY: The bride doesn't want to chat?
CAROLINE: Stop it.
TOBY: Well, the bride is sure snotty this morning.
TOBY: What's his name again?
OSCAR: Arthur Gayle.
JIMMY: What a homo.
TOBY: He sure walks like a girl.
JIMMY: And runs like one and talks like one and throws like one. Probably takes a pee like one too just squats right down.
TOBY: He smarted off to me the other day told me I was a bourgeois.
JIMMY: What the frig's a bourgeois?
OSCAR: ( to Toby ) Call him a sissy.
TOBY: Just see what he says.
OSCAR: Just see what he says.
JIMMY: Yeah, do it.
ARTHUR: Oh, my, my look at all that yellow: Didn't your mama teach you to wash your hands after you pee?
TOBY: Oh, shut up.
ARTHUR: ( rolls his eyes; Now that's what I like an insult with some originality. Did you just make that up? Just now? So clever.
TOBY: Why don't you take a long walk off a short pier?
ARTHUR: ( though he's not Excuse me, but has anyone ever told you your breath would gag a maggot?
TOBY: Well, at least I'm not a great big sissy!
ARTHUR: GET UP! GET UP, YOU SON OF A BITCHING MAGGOT GAGGER! I'LL STOMP YOUR GUTS OUT! I'LL KILL
YOU!: Toby gets up, and again Arthur sails in with those wild roundhouse swings. Then Toby gets in a solid punch to Arthur's face that rocks the bigger boy back on his heels. Arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded buffalo. Almost immediately Arthur's eye puffs and begins to swell shut. Snot streaming from both nostrils, still roaring, Arthur flies at Toby again. Toby closes with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the two stagger around the street like drunken dancers. They separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with each other again. Then Arthur hooks Toby's leg, trips him, and the two roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment. They hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting, flailing, kicking first Toby is on top, then Arthur, then Toby, then Arthur. By now they are panting, each breath is a heave, a gasp. Then, suddenly, Arthur gives out completely he falls on top of Toby, pressing him deeper into the mud. With his last bit of strength Toby throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while PEPPER BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his leg. Toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully. He looks relieved at least it's over. No, it's not. From behind him he hears three words.
ARTHUR: Take it back.
ARTHUR: Take it back. Say it.
TOBY: Say it.
ARTHUR: Say it.
TOBY: Okay. I take it back.
ARTHUR: No, say 'You're not a sissy.'
TOBY: You're not a sissy.
CAROLINE: I won't do it, you know. I won't be a referee between the two of Who asked you?
TOBY: Who asked you?
CAROLINE: You both do. You do. Just by coming home like this you ask me to take your side when he raises Well, the answer's 'No.' I'm going to make this marriage work. No Oh, the bride is calm. Who the hell cares?
TOBY: Oh, the bride is calm. Who the hell cares?
CAROLINE: ( to herself ) . seems like this place is so ugly. Seems like everywhere I look there's something. ugly.
DWIGHT: Who won?
TOBY: ( surprised ) Uh, well, uh. he's the one can't see out of one eye.
DWIGHT: Hot damn! You actually gave little Lord Gayle a black eye?
TOBY: Well, it wasn't black yet.
DWIGHT: But it was all puffed up? Then it was a shiner.
DWIGHT: How'd it start?
TOBY: I called him a sissy.
DWIGHT: Well, he sure's hell can't sue you for slander. That boy fights for the pink team. Did you make him Well. he was just ready to. I called him a big-assed, squat- to-pee sissy. I'd have won bigger except he hit me when I wasn't looking.
TOBY: Well. he was just ready to. I called him a big-assed, squat- to-pee sissy. I'd have won bigger except he hit me when I wasn't looking.
DWIGHT: ( suddenly serious ) He dry-gulched you. Now that's your fault. You gotta keep your guard up. There's no excuse for getting dry-gulched. I'll show you a couple moves after supper that'll leave Miss Arthur Gayle wondering what month it is.
DWIGHT: . so he says, 'You and who else's army?' 'Just the three of us,' I say. 'Me, myself and I.' Well, after school he's waiting for me and he yells something I tell you, with people like that, you got to hurt 'em, gotta inflict pain, or they'll never leave you So it was real hot out, okay? And there were these horse turds laying all over the place. I picked one up and went up to him, but not acting tough, okay? Acting more like, 'Oh gee, I'm so scared, please don't hurt me.' Sort of like this:
DWIGHT: So I say, 'Excuse me, but what's the problem?' And he starts in on me again, blah, blah, blah, and I jam a horse turd right into that big mouth. Then I give him a sucker punch in the breadbasket, and he goes down like a.
DWIGHT: No, no. From the shoulder. Like this. This. Otherwise you leave yourself wide open. Yeah, better, better. and keep those feet moving, shuffle, shuffle, that's right. now try for my face. good.
CAROLINE: . not good, to tell you the truth not good at all. No, he's not mean to me. No, he's good about that: comes home right after work every night. Oh, Marian, I don't know maybe I just got my hopes too high, although I don't think so. All I want is a little. . a little son-of-a-bitching sweetness. That's all. You think so, huh? You always did have an eye for Dwight, didn't The thing is, he's out on the porch teaching Jack to box right now. I keep thinking if I can hang on, things'll settle down. If I can just hang on long enough, it'll work out and my kid'll have a father. You know?
TOBY: You said you'd show me how to dry-gulch somebody.
DWIGHT: Okay. Now you can always kick somebody in the balls, but I like this one better: What you do is hit 'em in the throat with the side of your forearm. You wait 'til hah!
DWIGHT: Now that's dry-gulching. Hit 'em in the throat, but do it before they're expecting it. Now you try.
TOBY: I'm afraid I'll hurt you.
DWIGHT: You won't.
TOBY: But I might.
DWIGHT: Come onnn. You're not trying.
DWIGHT: Well, don't go all shy and delicate on me you're as sissy as little Miss Arthur Gayle. Yeah I'll just call you 'Little Miss Jackie Wolff.' Ooh, my, yes Hello, Jackie.
DWIGHT: Aw, Jesus Christ, if you're gonna
TOBY: You just about got dry-gulched, my
CAROLINE: I know you may think this is silly, Dwight, but it seems like. I don't know, like an emblem or something. I want to be able to see your face when we make love. How else can we be
DWIGHT: You just don't know what's good, Sugar. You're too tense. You just relax and Dwight'll take you on a little trip. Okay? You'll have a good time.
DWIGHT: . are the prettiest thing I've ever seen. I mean it. You are. The way your hair curls up right there. So pretty. I just love you so much. I don't know what I'd do if you ever left me. I couldn't take it. Guy I knew in the Navy had a saying: 'If you love her, here's what to do: Let her go visit places new. If she loves you, she'll come back to you. If she don't come back. hunt the bitch down and kill her.' That's awful, I guess. I don't feel that way, but close. My pretty thing.
TOBY: . but ask him again, why don't you? I hate it so much.
CAROLINE: ( never stops sewing ) I asked him a week ago, I asked him this morning he wants you to keep the paper route.
TOBY: Then make him give me the money. It's mine, I earned it. It's $220.00 already.
CAROLINE: He won't. He says he'll keep it for when you really need it.
TOBY: That's not fair. I ought to be able to have my own money. But it's mine.
CAROLINE: You remind me of a baby bird you know those frantic little things with their mouths wide open, wanting, wanting.
TOBY: Well, at least ask him about my gym shoes again. I can practice barefoot but for games I gotta have shoes.
CAROLINE: I'm not a referee. I won't do Oh, we know, we know: the bride won't argue. The bride won't raise her voice.
TOBY: Oh, we know, we know: the bride won't argue. The bride won't raise her voice.
CAROLINE: Well, I'll tell you what the bride will do: the bride will get up and walk over there and slap hell out of the bride's son. Now does the bride's son want his face Oh, I hate it here! I wish we could just get up and go.
TOBY: Oh, I hate it here! I wish we could just get up and go.
CAROLINE: I don't have another 'get up and go' left in me! You understand? I'm telling you I've hit a god- damn wall. I can't run anymore. Now this whole thing isn't perfect for me, either. let me impress that on you real strong, okay? I don't wake up singing every morning. But I'm going to make this marriage work I won't join in any fights, you got that? I won't even raise my voice!
CAROLINE: See those two roses? He picked them for me on his way home last Big deal.
TOBY: Big deal.
CAROLINE: I'm trying to concentrate on the good stuff.
NORMA: What d'ya think? I think I look like a fool. Who cares? Six weeks to graduation, and California, here I come!
CAROLINE: ( lamely ) Seriously: you have to concentrate on the good stuff.
CAROLINE: ( breathy ) Try to find the good stuff, honey.
TOBY: I'm telling you I didn't.
DWIGHT: And I know damn well you did.
TOBY: Well, you're wrong.
DWIGHT: About some things, yeah. Not about this. You're a goddam hog, and I proved it.
TOBY: How do you know Skipper didn't eat it? Or Norma? Or Pearl?
DWIGHT: I told all three of them to stay away from this candy for twenty- four hours.
TOBY: Well, how do you know I even ate I counted them. You hogged down eleven chocolate covered cherries since yesterday afternoon.
DWIGHT: ( a triumphant smile ) I counted them. You hogged down eleven chocolate covered cherries since yesterday afternoon.
TOBY: So what?
DWIGHT: So that makes you a hog. I just wanted to establish that fact, and now I have. Hey. Mr. Hotshot Hog and I've just been establishing some facts, and what we come up with is this: One, he's a pig who gobbles down everybody's candy; two, he lies about it; three, he lays around on his lazy ass day and night reading, reading; and four, he's not getting any ten-dollar gym shoes. That's about what we've come up with so far.
DWIGHT: ( to Caroline and Hey. Mr. Hotshot Hog and I've just been establishing some facts, and what we come up with is this: One, he's a pig who gobbles down everybody's candy; two, he lies about it; three, he lays around on his lazy ass day and night reading, reading; and four, he's not getting any ten-dollar gym shoes. That's about what we've come up with so far.
SKIPPER: Oh, Dad.
DWIGHT: ( a high, mincing Oh, Dad!
TOBY: ( to Caroline ) Why don't you ever take up for me?
DWIGHT: ( to Caroline ) Why don't you ever help me straighten that boy out?
DWIGHT: All he does is read or listen to records or sing.
TOBY: Oh, big, big deal, who cares, and as long as we're passing out news here, I don't want to do my paper route anymore.
DWIGHT: I bet you don't big lazy candy hog like you'd rather lay on his ass and read, wouldn't you? Let me tell you something: you're gonna deliver those papers if I have to walk behind you with a horsewhip ever' step of the way.
TOBY: Then give me the money I earn!
DWIGHT: Hell, no. I'm putting that in the bank for you for when you really need it cuss me now, thank me Mom, won't you at least make him let me have the shoes for gym? How can I play basketball without gym shoes? I'm the only one who
TOBY: Mom, won't you at least make him let me have the shoes for gym? How can I play basketball without gym shoes? I'm the only one who
TOBY: It's not the shoes, is it? Or the candy. It's me, isn't it? You just can't stand the fact of me. I, well, no, it's not that I just want you to be well-behaved. Your rich daddy 'Duke' doesn't care anything about you, and so somebody's got to train you, and one of the things you've gotta be trained about is not to be a hog and eat everybody's candy like a
DWIGHT: I, well, no, it's not that I just want you to be well-behaved. Your rich daddy 'Duke' doesn't care anything about you, and so somebody's got to train you, and one of the things you've gotta be trained about is not to be a hog and eat everybody's candy like a
CAROLINE: Dwight and Toby glance at each other nervously. What is this?
CAROLINE: ( her eyes still on What's the matter, honey?
DWIGHT: What's the matter, honey?
CAROLINE: ( louder ) TOBY DWIGHT
CAROLINE: A furious Caroline raises her head, doubles up both fists, and yells.
CAROLINE: I. Will. Not. Referee.
DWIGHT: ( taken aback ) Jack, I think you've made your mother nervous, so why don't we just go on to Scouts and let her ( to Caroline ) You lay down and rest awhile.
DWIGHT: Check for the tongue tonight you forgot it last week. Otherwise you won't get your life-saving badge.
TOBY: Bastard. Swallow that.
BOY: ( laughing ) Give my pud a big squeeze while you're at it, why don't you?
ARTHUR: You like my dog?
TOBY: Yeah, he's nice.
ARTHUR: Smart, too he can talk.
TOBY: ( smiles ) Sure I just about believe you.
ARTHUR: Hey, Pepper what's on a tree?
ARTHUR: Bark! Way to go, Pepper pretty smart. Oh, I was wondering, Pepper I wanted to ask you something: how's the world treating you?
ARTHUR: Rough! Yeah, I know what you That's dumb. A little funny, though. How come your dad never comes to meetings with you?
TOBY: That's dumb. A little funny, though. How come your dad never comes to meetings with you?
ARTHUR: I don't have a dad. Never did. I sprang full-blown from my mother's forehead. You want to walk home with me and Pepper?
TOBY: Sure compared to a ride home with Dwight, it'll be like heaven on a June day.
ARTHUR: . Tobias? Your real name is Tobias? Toby. Tobias. I like it it's very elegant.
TOBY: ( shrugs ) Every day of my life feels like a mile on the Bataan Death March.
ARTHUR: ( laughs ) I knew I'd like you.
TOBY: Why'd you point at me that day?
ARTHUR: Because you're an alien. You don't belong in Concrete any more than I do. This place would like to kill us because we're different.
TOBY: Oh, come on, Arthur. That's a little dramatic.
ARTHUR: Think so? You know what chickens do if one chicken's born with a little difference? With a few black feathers on its head, say? They peck at the black spot 'til the chicken's dead they can't stand the fact that it's different. Now we're both different. Your difference is something other than. . my difference. But we're both aliens here.
TOBY: I don't exactly feel like an alien. I've got friends here.
ARTHUR: Yes, and they're fools. And you act like a fool when you're around them. A prediction: if you stay in Concrete, you'll wind up working at the A&P either that or you'll go on a rampage with a hunting rifle.
TOBY: Yeah, and you'll wind up a recluse that everybody says likes to dress up in his mama's old clothes.
ARTHUR: ( laughs ) Maybe, maybe, but no matter how many times I have to repeat: my primary goal's to get out of
TOBY: Arthur and Toby laugh. As they walk on, though, Toby's face is thoughtful.
TOBY: Whose dog is that on the porch?
DWIGHT: You said you wanted a dog.
TOBY: You said you wanted a dog.
DWIGHT: You said you wanted a dog.
TOBY: A collie, though. Not this one.
DWIGHT: Well, he's yours. You paid for him. Go get ready for Norma's play.
TOBY: What d'you mean I paid for him?
TOBY: My Winchester's gone.
DWIGHT: ( eyes never leaving This dog is pure-bred Weimaraner. A champion.
TOBY: I don't want it.
DWIGHT: ( as above ) Well, you're purely out of luck, aren't you, 'cause that rifle's on its way to Seattle.
TOBY: I want my rifle!
DWIGHT: Well, want in one hand and shit in the other see which gets full But, Dwight, that Winchester was And Champ's your dog. Jesus, I trade some old piece of crap for a valuable hunting dog, and all you can do is piss and moan.
TOBY: But, Dwight, that Winchester was And Champ's your dog. Jesus, I trade some old piece of crap for a valuable hunting dog, and all you can do is piss and moan.
DWIGHT: And Champ's your dog. Jesus, I trade some old piece of crap for a valuable hunting dog, and all you can do is piss and moan.
TOBY: I'm not pissing and moaning.
DWIGHT: The hell you aren't. You can just make your own deals from now on.
CAROLINE: What's wrong?
TOBY: Dwight traded my rifle for a dog. He says the dog's for me, but it's some stupid dog he wanted. All right. Okay, Dwight. You stay here. Don't come inside.
CAROLINE: All right. Okay, Dwight. You stay here. Don't come inside.
CAROLINE: ( calm ) Get his rifle back.
DWIGHT: But that dog's a champion!
CAROLINE: Get his rifle back.
DWIGHT: Am I supposed to go clear to Seattle just to get.
CAROLINE: Get his rifle back.
DWIGHT: Jesus Christ, woman, I don't even know the guy's last name.
DWIGHT: All right, all right. The guy's supposed to send the A.K.C. papers. When he sends 'em, I'll know his name and address, and I'll go get the god-damn rifle back. Jesus.
CAROLINE: Well, I did it and the bride didn't even raise her voice: he says he'll get the rifle back as soon as the guy who sold him the dog sends the papers. 'Course, having seen that dog, I wouldn't suggest you hang by your thumbs 'til those papers come. I mean, that dog is ugly.
CAROLINE: 'Course, having seen that dog, I wouldn't suggest you hang by your thumbs 'til those papers come. I mean, that dog is ugly.
CAROLINE: That's nice I haven't seen a real smile out of you in a month.
TOBY: Oh, Mom, can't we leave here? I hate it so much. You don't like it either all you do is stick your head in a sewing machine night and day. Let's just leave and start over someplace else.

DWIGHT: I was downtown with Champ a few minutes ago, and I met a guy who recognized him. Said he'd seen my dog this very morning. Told me an interesting story of how he and the dog happened to meet. What d'you think about that?

CAROLINE: Oh, honey, good news Truman's going to campaign for him. I gave twenty-five dollars to his campaign office today. I've been thinking I'd like to work.
DWIGHT: . So the S.O.B. had been on my back for a week at work, okay? Sayin' I stole his wrench, an' poured oil all over his tools, as if! Anyway, he went just one step too far with old Dwight, okay? Spat on the floor as I walked by. I turned around and walked back to him, acting so dainty and humble and scared, you know, all innocent and the minute he took his eyes off me, BLAM, I dry gulched him! I shut his water off good! Never gave me another second's grief to this very day. I heard Kennedy on the news again tonight I don't know: I hate the Democrats and the Republicans, but then once in a while somebody comes along who doesn't seem . a liar.
CAROLINE: I heard Kennedy on the news again tonight I don't know: I hate the Democrats and the Republicans, but then once in a while somebody comes along who doesn't seem . a liar.
DWIGHT: Kennedy the senator from Rome.
CAROLINE: He gives me hope.
DWIGHT: I know what he gives you, and it sure as hell isn't hope.
CAROLINE: ( laughs ) It's true he is attractive! And it may just be those white teeth that I respond to. But I don't think so. ( a beat ) I'm going to work for his campaign.
DWIGHT: No. Too many Republicans in this town. They hear my wife's working for the Democrats, they'll take their cars someplace else to be fixed. Bad idea. No.

TOBY: He hears you do that, you're dead. Hey, lemme copy your math No, but I'll show you how to work the problems.
ARTHUR: No, but I'll show you how to work the problems.

TOBY: ( new tone ) I know it. He's winning. I do act like him. I feel like him sometimes. I've gotta get out of this place or I'm a dead one.
ARTHUR: I know, but you've said that for two years.
TOBY: I mean it. I may go live with my brother Gregory in Princeton.
ARTHUR: You mean the brother Gregory in Princeton who never calls you? That brother Gregory?
TOBY: He wrote me.
ARTHUR: And he asked you to live with him?
TOBY: No. But I'm going. Or maybe I could go to a prep school like Gregory did. Like my dad did.
ARTHUR: What about your grades? And what would you use for money?
TOBY: I don't know. Dwight owes me over twelve hundred bucks! If I hadn't let him keep my paper route money, I'd be okay.
ARTHUR: If the dog hadn't stopped to pee, he'd have caught the rabbit. I think Dwight was right about you I think you fight for the pink

CAROLINE: How was it?
TOBY: Hard. I think I did okay. I'll know Monday.
CAROLINE: Take that trash out for me,
TOBY: My application forms must've come today, and he threw them away.
DWIGHT: Hey, I thought I was helping him thought I'd save him some trouble 'cause he's got no chance of getting into some fancy prep You've always got your nose pressed up against the bake shop window, don't you, Dwight?
CAROLINE: You've always got your nose pressed up against the bake shop window, don't you, Dwight?
DWIGHT: You feel like everybody else is inside, and you're stuck on the outside. It turns you mean. It turns you ugly. And one day do you hear me, Dwight? One day all that ugliness is going to snap back and hit you in the face.
CAROLINE: You feel like everybody else is inside, and you're stuck on the outside. It turns you mean. It turns you ugly. And one day do you hear me, Dwight? One day all that ugliness is going to snap back and hit you in the face.
DWIGHT: Ooooooh, oh, I'm so scared. Oooh.
ARTHUR: I won't do it.
TOBY: But why? You work right in the office nobody'll ever know.
ARTHUR: I'm surprised you'd want help from anybody who fights for the pink I'm asking you to help me, man. I got word yesterday that I did really well on those tests but that's not enough. I've got to cheat and lie but I don't care: this is my one chance to get out of here!
TOBY: I'm asking you to help me, man. I got word yesterday that I did really well on those tests but that's not enough. I've got to cheat and lie but I don't care: this is my one chance to get out of here!
ARTHUR: No. Why should you get to be the one? Why not me?
TOBY: You could leave too, you know.
ARTHUR: No, I've grown progressively fond of Concrete. I think I'll stay here all alone and dress up in my mama's old clothes sometimes like you said.
CAROLINE: Come help me stuff envelopes.
TOBY: I'll do some this afternoon.
CAROLINE: No, I need to take them with me.
TOBY: I'll be in in a minute. Let me finish this article.
CAROLINE: Boy, you irritate me. I think maybe you ought to. Yeah I think maybe you should
PEARL: 'You got letters from those
CAROLINE: Maybe that last school will come through.
DWIGHT: Yeah, or maybe he'll get a contract in the mail asking him to be a singing star on T.V. Well, he's got about as much chance of one as of the other.
TOBY: A Concrete boy.
MANAGER: We only take boys who really want to work hard. Is that you? I'd want you to start evenings now, and I'd want you all summer no vacations. Food service work isn't easy. It's not something that comes to you in a year or two. So. You think you have what it takes to be an A&P management trainee?
TOBY: ( straight ) That's exactly what I've got.
PEARL: I can't find where this green piece goes it's gotta be grass.
CAROLINE: ( to Toby ) Don't go off without eating.
TOBY: I'll get a sandwich after work.
DWIGHT: I was trying to listen to a "Yeah, he's here,"
PEARL: "Yeah, he's here,"
TOBY: Hello? All right. Tomorrow, then.
TOBY: It's Hill School the last one I applied to. They haven't accepted me, but they're sending somebody up to interview me.
TOBY: . Yeah, I enjoy my classes, especially the ones that are advanced, but I've been feeling a little restless lately. It's hard to explain.
MR. HOWARD: Well, you're probably bored. Not being challenged. Your application was very good, Toby, but we have many boys who want to go to Hill. Not everybody is comfortable at a prep school.
TOBY: I think I would be. My father and brother went to prep schools.
MR. HOWARD: Is that right? Where?
TOBY: Deerfield and Choate.
MR. HOWARD: I see. Well, maybe you'd like it. Hill was difficult for me, though classes were hard, and the boys seemed cold interested in money and social position. And I hated those snowy Pennsylvania winters! But then in my last year, something changed. The guys in my class grew close, so close that I still think of them as a second family.
TOBY: ( honest ) I want that. I do, and
ARCH: . so she said, 'No, I don't want you to do that,' and I said 'Oh, baby, let me get down and grovel on it.' I mean, I ate her pussy 'til my tongue was calloused, and
ARCH: . so anyway, she went off like a Roman candle I mean that woman can scream. I said, 'You liked that, didn't you, baby?' I said, 'You liked the old Arch Cook special, didn't you?'
MR. HOWARD: Toby, boys at Hill talk roughly sometimes too you'd have to be ready for that. I can see you've had sort of a sheltered
MR. HOWARD: You seem like a fine boy, and I'll give you a good report tomorrow. But there are lots of boys applying, and we'll just have to wait and see whether
DWIGHT: Yeah, it's the guy who thinks he knows everything. Thinks he's so smart, but fella, what you don't know would fill a book. General Motors makes shit cars.
TOBY: ( weakly ) That's, uh, that's this guy. he's a mechanic. did some bad work on our car.
PEARL: I know something'll make you feel good: that man called you got the scholarship.
PEARL: He said they're gonna give you two thousand three hundred dollars a year and it costs two thousand five hundred dollars. so you gotta come up with the other two hundred. Great, huh? I'm making hot dogs I'll make one for you. Can you put mustard on some bread for us?
PEARL: What're you doing home so earl. Oh! Toby he got that scholarship two thousand and three hundred
DWIGHT: Hey, leopard. I say, 'Hey, leopard.' I know you, leopard I can see those spots you can't Thinks he can go to some fancy prep school and fool everybody. Not a chance. I know a thing or two about a thing or two. Who threw that away?
DWIGHT: Who threw that away?
TOBY: I did.
DWIGHT: Because it was empty.
TOBY: Because it was empty.
DWIGHT: Empty? That look empty to you?
PEARL: It looks empty to me.
TOBY: It looks empty to me, too.
DWIGHT: Look again, hotshot. Is it empty?
PEARL: ( to Toby ) Now. Now, Mr. Big-Time Prep- School fucker, is it empty?
DWIGHT: ( to Toby ) Now. Now, Mr. Big-Time Prep- School fucker, is it empty?
TOBY: ( muffled ) No, it wasn't empty.
DWIGHT: ( lets him go ) All right clean it out.
DWIGHT: Now. Was it empty?
TOBY: Dwight slaps Toby across the mouth and the battle is on. As Pearl stands frozen, Toby lunges at Dwight, they grapple and stagger around the room. GLASS SHATTERS, the kitchen table CRASHES over, and their feet STAMP and SHUFFLE but Toby is a wild man. Even though he has only one good hand. He lands a blow between Dwight's eyes that bangs the man back against the wall. Dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs, flings it at Toby. Most of it misses. Again they grapple. Toby manages to throw Dwight down, then grabs a broom that has fallen to the floor, presses it against Dwight's throat, using his good hand and one knee. Dwight's mouth gapes wide, his eyes bulge, and he jerks himself frantically trying to dislodge Toby, but Toby hangs on like grim death. Desperate, Dwight grabs Toby's bandaged hand, bringing it close to his own face, and bites the stump of Toby's injured finger as hard as he Toby and Pearl scream simultaneously. Pearl in horror, Toby in pain. Pearl runs into her bedroom. Toby reels back in pain, holding his freshly-bleeding hand. Dwight takes his chance, grabs Toby by the throat, forces him down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy. Toby's eyelids begin to flutter. He's losing consciousness.
WHAM!: From out of nowhere a baseball bat hits Dwight flat across the shoulder blades, knocking the breath out of him, stunning him momentarily. As he looks up, we see Caroline, one of the baseball bats from the utility porch drawn back, aimed at Dwight's head, ready to strike again.
CAROLINE: ( level ) Get away from him or I will kill
CAROLINE: What is this?
TOBY: I got the scholarship and he went nuts. He's crazy, and I'm leaving. I'm leaving!
DWIGHT: Great. Go!
TOBY: Give me my paper route money, and you'll never have to see my face That money is gone with the wind. That's right. I spent it as you made it. It's gone. Poof.
DWIGHT: ( manages a smile ) That money is gone with the wind. ( as Toby stares ) That's right. I spent it as you made it. It's gone. Poof.
CAROLINE: It's not so much that you're disappointing it's that you're consistently disappointing.
DWIGHT: Oh, fancy, fancy talk fancy talk for a whore. I know a thing or two about a thing or two. I got friends in this town that tell me things, and I found out some man down at that campaign headquarters found you a job in Washington, D.C. Gonna run off with him, aren't you, Miss Whore?
CAROLINE: He's just a friend.
DWIGHT: Miss Liar. Miss Whore Liar.
TOBY: I'm leaving, Mom. You can leave, too. You don't have to stay here.
CAROLINE: I don't, do I?
TOBY: No, you don't.
CAROLINE: I could leave with you, couldn't
I?: Yes, you could!
TOBY: Yes, you could!
DWIGHT: What about me?
CAROLINE: I could just walk right out that door, couldn't I?
TOBY: Yes, you could!
CAROLINE: My God. the lightness.
DWIGHT: What about me?
CAROLINE: I'm leaving, too.
DWIGHT: Oh, Dwight, why do you want me to stay? You don't even like me, not really.
CAROLINE: Oh, Dwight, why do you want me to stay? You don't even like me, not really.
DWIGHT: You're not leaving!
CAROLINE: ( gentle ) Look again, Dwight I'm already
DWIGHT: . you two've always sided in against me, always thought you were better than me. I tried. I did the best I could. What about me? Am I supposed to just crawl off in a ditch someplace and die? I've always been the nigger. Everybody's nigger. Ever since I was little. What about me? When is it ever Dwight's turn for some consideration? What about me? I'll tell you one thing you'll remember me!
DWIGHT: What about me? When is it ever Dwight's turn for some consideration? What about me? I'll tell you one thing you'll remember me!
CAROLINE: Man, oh man.
TOBY: Man, oh man, oh man.
CAROLINE: Well, we're out.
TOBY: Great, isn't it?
CAROLINE: Yes. It's great. And you got the scholarship! Congratulations, Yeah, I'm out! I'm outta here! Maybe I'll crash and burn, but it's a chance, so I'm gone! I'm history, Histoire. Nobody's gonna tell me what to do now, nobody. I'm free as a bird. Sayonara nest. Heaven on a June day!
TOBY: Yeah, I'm out! I'm outta here! Maybe I'll crash and burn, but it's a chance, so I'm gone! I'm history, Histoire. Nobody's gonna tell me what to do now, nobody. I'm free as a bird. Sayonara nest. Heaven on a June day!
CAROLINE: ( weakly ) Yeah, heaven on a June day.
TOBY: What'd he say about you having a job in D.C.?
CAROLINE: Oh, Helen found me something in a real estate office, but.
TOBY: So now you can go! Oh. Oh! I am so damn glad to get out of this place! I'll be in 'fourth form.' Doesn't that sound great? And if you get a two-bedroom place in D.C., I can come for vacations and summers. I'm out. I'm out!
TOBY: ( notices she's upset ) What? Oh, don't cry he's not worth it.
TOBY: She holds Toby at arm's length and studies him.
CAROLINE: My you've grown, haven't you.
CAROLINE: Are you sure you'll be all right?
TOBY: ( nice ) Get on the bus.
CAROLINE: ( stuffing bills into I borrowed money from everybody I know it's the two hundred you need for the tuition, and an extra fifty. Buy yourself a blazer. Oh, God. I'll miss you. I'll write you. You sure your hand's Get on the bus, Mom.
