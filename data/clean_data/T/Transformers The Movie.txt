ARBLUS: Transform and flee, Kranix! You must warn all you meet of the horror of Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature is surrounded by the strange energy cloud and it looks like his body has simultaneously caught fire and been doused with acid.
KRANIX: Arblus! No!
NARRATOR: It is the year 2005. The treacherous Decepticons have conquered the Autobots' home planet of Cybertron. But from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots prepare to retake their homeland.
IRONHIDE: Every time I look into this thing, my circuits sizzle. I'm tired of this waiting game, Prime. When are we gonna start bustin' Deceptichops?
OPTIMUS PRIME: We still don't have enough Energon cubes to power a full scale assault, Ironhide.
IRONHIDE: Then let me make another run to Autobot City on Earth. I'll bring you back more cubes than you'll know what to do with.
PRIME: Alright, ready the shuttle for launch.
IRONHIDE: ( looking into monitor ) Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps.
YAHOO!: ( looking into monitor ) Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps.
JAZZ: No sign of Decepticons in this sector, What about Moon Base 2?
PRIME: What about Moon Base 2?
JAZZ: Jazz to Moon Base 2.
ANOTHER MOON: This is the second moon. It is much closer to Cybertron than the first one. This is where Bumblebee and Spike are Jazz to Moon Base 2.
BUMBLEBEE: Bumblebee and Spike here.
BUMBLEBEE: All clear, Jazz.
SPIKE: Hey, Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, I miss him, and tell him I'll be coming home as soon as we've kicked Megatron's tail across the galaxy.
IRONHIDE: Will do, Spike.
PRIME: Commence countdown, Cliffjumper.
CLIFFJUMPER: THE LUNAR "MOUNTAIN" Suddenly, smoke starts pouring out of the mountain.
CLIFFJUMPER: Then, the "mountain" which must be made of paper mache or something blows away revealing The shuttle!
PRIME: Now, all we need is a little Energon and a lot of luck.
IRONHIDE: If I can dodge Dececpticon rays, I can sure as shootin' dodge a couple of
PROWL: You were saying?
MEGATRON!: In all his glory.
MEGATRON: Die Autobots!
BRAWN: is cut in half by Megatron's blast.
ON PROWL: as SCAVENGER MELTS HIM DOWN.
THE INSECTICONS: .eat away at the hole in the shuttle to make way for. .an ARMY of other Decepticons including Laserbeak who enter, firing.
MEGATRON: This was almost too easy, Starscream.
STARSCREAM: Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than attacking the real threat: the Autobots moon base.
MEGATRON: You're an idiot, Starscream. Were we simply to wipe out that minuscule base, they could build another one.
IRONHIDE: Fat chance, Megatron!
MEGATRON: Such heroic nonsense!
ON DANIEL: Daniel, a classic twelve year old American boy watches the portable viewer which is like an over-sized Boy Scout compass. WIDEN SHOT to show he is at an old fashioned "fishin' hole" on Earth - surrounded by weeping willows, assorted trees and shrubs, and that his fishing pole is stuck in the dirt, the line floating lazily out on the water.
DANIEL: Let's watch Ironhide land it, Hot Rod! As Daniel runs to small skateboard-like device, hits a button, and watches, it transforms into a hoverboard and rides it, like a surfer up a steep, grassy hillside we change angle to feature.
HOT ROD: an "adolescent" Autobot. He is in robot mode, sitting with his fishing rod held between two fingers, looking bored with it all.
DANIEL: ( calling excitedly ) Hurry or we'll miss it!
HOT ROD: lopes up hill after Daniel.
DANIEL: Hey! Let me out.
HOT ROD: Why settle for a peek when you can see everything from Lookout Mountain?
DANIEL: But we're not supposed to go beyond City
HOT ROD: ON KUP AND OTHER AUTOBOTS KUP - a grizzled, "old Soldier" of an Autobot - is directing the positioning of a large metal road barricade. Hot Rod barrels through a sign which reads: "STOP -THIS AREA OFF LIMITS", almost knocking Kup over in dust and wind
KUP: disgustedly watches Hot Rod drive up the Cam bustin', turbo revvin' young punk.
HOT ROD: This is it! Now take a squint through those babies.
DANIEL: Hot Rod, look! There's a hole in the
HOT ROD: DANIEL'S P.O.V - BINOCULAR MATTE - THE SHUTTLE The hole Megatron blasted in order to get into the shuttle mars the otherwise perfect exterior of the ship.
HOT ROD: This is for Ironhide. As so's this!
STARSCREAM: He ducks away from the door.
THE CONSTRUCTICONS: Firing out of the hole.
MEGATRON: He's furious.
STARSCREAM: It was your stupid strategy!
KUP: What's that darn fool doing? Hound looks up and points.
HOUND: ANGLE ON THE SHUTTLE Suddenly it cracks open, and Decepticons shoot out of the wreckage like toys from a pinata.
MEGATRON: ( shouting to forces ) ( he looks down and fires )
HOT ROD: Hang on!
HOT ROD: ( SHOUTING )
BLITZWING: ( amused ) Come on down, Autobrat!
HOT ROD: ( CONTINUED )
ON BLITZWING: about to fire, when.
SHRAPNEL: who is flying nearby.
BLITZWING: transforms to robot mode and turns as. Kup comes flying, feet first, into Blitzwing knocking him off the mountain
HOT ROD: Not bad for an old timer!
KUP: ( gruffly ) Old timer?! That's something you'll never be if you don't get back to the city. You know what we used to do with cocky, insubordinate upstarts?
HOT ROD: ( interrupting ) Save it.
STARSCREAM: transforming into jet mode, fires on them with laser bursts which.
PERCEPTOR: transforms to humanoid and runs toward.. . Three new Autobots, ARCEE, a lovely female Autobot of about Hot Rod's age, SPRINGER, a very muscular and bantering "Indiana Jones" type Autobot and ULTRA MAGNUS, the large and soldierly City Commander.
PERCEPTOR: Ultra Magnus...a cursory evaluation of Decepticon capability indicates a distinct tactical deficit!
ULTRA MAGNUS: In other words, Perceptor.
SPRINGER: ( translating ) We're outnumbered!
ULTRA MAGNUS: Springer, Arcee, transform Autobot City!
AND ARCEE: STARSCREAM ( V.O. )
STARSCREAM: TRANSFORMS and hovers in robot mode, firing all around them as they.
STARSCREAM: There's no escape.Uuuuh! Just then, the floor of the courtyard STARTS TRANSFORMING - - the center line of the floor snaps shut like the halves of a gigantic steel shelled clam, trapping Starscream's foot.
STARSCREAM: Agggggggh! My foot!
ON MEGATRON: as he FLIES OVER SCENE, BLASTING this way and that, shouting
MEGATRON: Breach their defenses!
ON INSECTICONS: who are trailing Megatron, attack the fast CLOSING CITY, trying to GNAW AND DEVOUR their way through the PORTS and BRIDGES leading inside.
KICKBACK: ( Chewing on jamb of doorway Delicious, eh Shrapnel?
SHRAPNEL: ( CHEWING on draw-bridge to A little heavy on the electrons.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Hot Rod speeds up, passes Kup and. . rides up and over Kickback's back, using it like a stunt driver's ramp to.
ON SHRAPNEL: As Shrapnel looks up and reacts. .Kup hurtles up and over Kickback's back just as Kickback is starting to rise to see what knocked him face down onto the bridge in the first place. . Kup goes SAILING OT OVER OPEN SPACE between Kickback's back and the doorway into the city- -clobbering Shrapnel, who is in the way and landing on the city doorstep, driving in as.
THE DOORWAY: transforms, shutting down with metal shields with a "clank" sound as Kickback and Shrapnel both leap at is to. . bite Kup and Hot Rod and instead BREAK THEIR TEETH on steel door, falling face down with a grunt as LAST BITS OF CITY
ULTRA MAGNUS: ( sternly ) You can explain your security violation later, Hot Rod! Now, man your battle I don't have to explain my so called violation to you or anyone.
HOT ROD: I don't have to explain my so called violation to you or anyone.
KUP: ( tugs him along roughly ) He said "later!"
BLASTER: Lookout and shout! Yow! Explosions rock the Crows Nest. Blaster swivels around and tilts to see.
BLASTER: activates turret type LASER CANNON
BLASTER: Gonna lay some slugs on those overweight
CANNON SWIVELS: LASER BLAST cooks out and we FOLLOW IT OFF SCREEN to.
THE INSECTICONS: as a Laser BLAST hurls Bombshell up and out of sight and causes Shrapnel and Kickback to get sucked into the vacuum.
BLASTER: Perceptor joins him.
BLASTER: ( joyful at his direct hit ) I'm talkin' hits here, Autobuddies! Hits with a capital "aitch" like in Hard, Heavy and. ( sees Perceptor ) Hey, Perceptor, what's shakin' other than this fortress?
PERCEPTOR: Blaster, Ultra Magnus sends orders to contact Optimus Prime for reinforcements.
BLASTER: Alright! Cover your receptors, Perceptor! Blaster transforms to ghetto blaster mode and broadcasts VISIBLE rise and expand into space
THE WAVES: rise and expand into space
BLASTER: Optimus Prime. Do you read me? The Decepticons are blitzing Autobot City. We're really takin' a pounding. Don't know how much longer we can hold out.

BLASTER: No way. Two can play!
ON BLASTER: as he spews out CASSETTES which TRANSFORM into CUBBIE, a lion, STRIPES, a tiger, STINGER, a scorpion and BOLTS, a small, tough robot.
BLASTER: Sic 'em!
ON RUMBLE: as Cubbie takes him down by the foot, turning him over and over
ON STRIPES: as he SNAPS at Ratbat who screams and darts, trying to escape as we move to
PERCEPTOR: You think you got through to Prime?
BLASTER: Let's hope so! Cause if I didn't we're gonna look like burnt out toaster ovens!
THE SCREEN: Constructicons merge for the kill!
MEGATRON: Constructicons merge for the kill!
SPRINGER: Great! Megatron's making his big push and we can't even push.
KUP: Keep at it, Springer, lad! Help's at Together now!
DANIEL: also leans against it, his small legs starts moving easily now.
THE CATAPULT: starts moving easily now.
ARCEE: ( pushing, manages to speak to I was afraid you'd be trapped outside the city walls.
HOT ROD: ( likes her, too, but tries to Hey, I wasn't worried for a micro-second, ( enjoying letting him have it ) Then you probably didn't understand the situation. Before Hot Rod can react, Kup steps back from repositioned Catapult
ARCEE: ( enjoying letting him have it ) Then you probably didn't understand the situation. Before Hot Rod can react, Kup steps back from repositioned Catapult
KUP: That did it!
DANIEL: Kup, Hot Rod! Look!
ON DEVASTATOR: as he rises up and starts FIRING, HAMMERING, TEARING AWAY at metal shields which create armored walls of the transformed City.
SPRINGER: I got better things to do today than die.
DEVASTATOR: and explode harmlessly as Devastator continues to grunt and tear off armored layers of the city. He grabs Hot Rod and Kup and starts to crush them.

HOT ROD: We've got to save Prime! Punching.
KUP: That's his fight, lad! Stay away.
MEGATRON: grabs a jagged, spearlike piece of steel and hurls it at
PRIME: The steel "spear" pierces his side and sticks in him as. . he charges Megatron, .dodging shots from Megatron's gun to. .deliver a huge UPPERCUT which. .lifts Megatron into the air so high that. .
MEGATRON: lands and stealthily slips a laser dagger from his boot, turning and slashing at.
PRIME: as he comes for him, tearing. .a gash across Prime's midsection, which spews smoke and sparks and.
MEGATRON: ( gloating ) Farewell, Prime!
OPTIMUS PRIME: as he lifts chunks of broken concrete and catches the laser dagger on it, tossing it aside as he lunges at-
MEGATRON: who claws his fingers and digs them into Prime's eyes
MEGATRON: I'll rip out your optics! Optimus grabs Megatron's clawed hand in one of his hands, twists it in see-sawing test of strength which. Optimus wins in a judo toss which sends Megatron - - skidding face first through steel rubble, in a shower of sparks until he crashes into the side of the city.
HOT ROD: That's showing him, Optimus!
KUP: knocks two Decepticons on their tails and Finish him off, Prime! Do it now!
KUP: Finish him off, Prime! Do it now!
ON MEGATRON: as he spots a gun on the ground ahead of No more, Optimus Prime! Grant me mercy, I beg of you!

THE AUTOBOTS: fire after them, closing ranks on the shuttle, and pouring shots into the
STARSCREAM: Astrotrain, take off.
OPTIMUS PRIME: as he lies on an improvised bier-like platform, a profusion of electricity discharging tubes and "plasma" bottle devices hooked up to his arms and into his gaping middle wound.
SCANNERS: emit bleeps and show oscilloscopic patterns but sounds and wave patterns are steadily growing weaker and weaker.
PERCEPTOR: is bent over Prime, in microscope mode, examining him. He then transforms and straightens up, his voice strained and cracking with emotion.
PERCEPTOR: I fear the wounds are.
OPTIMUS PRIME: ( using remaining strength to Autobots.do not grieve. Soon, I shall be one with the matrix.
HOT ROD: ( a flash of hope ) ( looks off at Prime )
OPTIMUS PRIME: ( reaches up with right hand Ultra Magnus! It is to you, old friend, I shall pass the matrix as it was passed to me ..

OPTIMUS PRIME: ( gasping ) Nor was I, but one day, an Autobot shall rise from our ranks and use the powers of the Matrix to light our darkest hour.
OPTIMUS PRIME: ( voice failing, pressing on Until that day.
UNICRON: Rotating satellite dishes on the surface spark with electricity. Dissolve inside Unicron to reveal scenes of Prime's death and the passing of the Matrix to Ultra Magnus playing on various monitors. Some of the scenes are in slow motion, others are sped up. The effect should be eerie.
ASTROTRAIN: Jettison some weight, or I'll never make it to Cybertron.
STARSCREAM: Fellow Decepticons, Astrotrain has requested that we lighten our burden!
BONECRUSHER: In that case, I say it's survival of the So I hear a second on that?

UNICRON: I am Unicron.
MEGATRON: Show yourself!
UNICRON: I have summoned you here for a purpose.
MEGATRON: Nobody summons Megatron!
UNICRON: Then it pleases me to be the first.
MEGATRON: State your business.
UNICRON: Bring me the Autobot Matrix. It is the one thing - the only thing that can stand in my way.
MEGATRON: You have nothing to fear. I have already crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands.
UNICRON: You exaggerate.
MEGATRON: The point is, he is dead! And the Matrix died with him.
UNICRON: No. It has been passed to their new leader. Get it for me.
MEGATRON: Why should I? What's in it for me?
UNICRON: Your bargaining posture is highly dubious, but very well, I will provide you with a new body, and new troops to And nothing.
MEGATRON: And nothing.
UNICRON: And nothing.
MEGATRON: I belong to nobody.
UNICRON: Perhaps I misjudged you. Proceed on your way to oblivion. The Mist appears and starts to dissolve Megatron.
MEGATRON: ( pleading ) No, no. I accept your terms. I accept!
UNICRON: Excellent! Behold - Galvatron! X-ray images: wiring, circuitry, etc. flash on and off as a new and larger being starts to form, changing from dented Megatron to a huge, new creation: Galvatron.
GALVATRON: Long live Galvatron!
UNICRON: And these shall be your minions.
SCOURGE: SCOURGE ( Sweep character ) is bearded, fanged and ferocious looking and as soon as he has been CREATED, he roars and stretches and an ARRAY OF SIMILAR CREATURES - smaller and all wearing dark and matching uniforms - are INSTANTLY CREATED FROM OTHERS behind him

OTHER DECEPTICONS: in neat ranks but their grim expressions show their displeasure.
STARSCREAM: ( preening ) Get on with the ceremony! Dirge and others react to EERIE SOUNDS and look up and off. Starscream looks where others are looking and reacts.
STARSCREAM: Who disrupts my coronation?
GALVATRON: Coronation? This is bad comedy!
STARSCREAM: Megatron, is that you?
GALVATRON: Here's a clue!
GALVATRON: He transforms back to robot mode and confronts other Decepticons boastfully.

DECEPTICONS: LONG LIVE GALVATRON! He's about to do the big munch on..
UNICRON: Bit by bit, we see new sections of the planet being generated. Then, the sinister mist we saw at the beginning of the film starts pouring out.
UNICRON: A strange, LOUD HUM fills the air and the ground heaves and SHAKES beneath their Where'd that come from?!
JAZZ: Where'd that come from?!
CLIFFJUMPER: Who cares? I'm more worried about where it's going!

DANIEL: But what about my dad? He's on the moon between that monster and Cybertron.
ULTRA MAGNUS: Daniel, I'll do everything I can for And what are we going to do when we get there? If that thing crunches moons, it'll make short work of us.
HOT ROD: And what are we going to do when we get there? If that thing crunches moons, it'll make short work of us.
ULTRA MAGNUS: Maybe the Matrix can stop it.
HOT ROD: You're right! It can.

HOT ROD: It's just a feeling.
KUP: THE AUTOBOTS TURN TO SEE POV - ANGLE ON ATTACKING DECEPTICONS Decepticon ships seem to dive from nowhere to attack the

GRIMLOCK: Me, Grimlock, love Kup's war stories!
KUP: You're living one now! Engage the boosters for Cybertron's sake! Hot Rod nods and quickly passes his hand over bank of SWITCHES all of which GLOW AND PULSE with the action.
ANOTHER ANGLE: as DECEPTICON FIREBALL COMES UP and SPLATTERS AGAINST WINDOW, sending tongues of fire running across the glass behind Hot Rod's head
HOT ROD: You got 'em!
GRIMLOCK: ( to Kup ) Tell Grimlock about Petro-Rabbits again.
KUP: ( muttering, using joystick ) I'll give you Petro-Rabbits. Contact! The Shuttle lurches and shakes

SPRINGER: Kup and Hot Rod just bought it!
ULTRA MAGNUS: I can't deal with that now.
SPRINGER: Face it, Magnus, the Decepticons 're gonna dog us until they see us dead! Ultra Magnus nods solemnly
ULTRA MAGNUS: ( cryptic ) Then that's exactly what they're gonna as he works controls which eject more Moleculon Missiles.
ON GALVATRON: as he works controls which eject more Moleculon Missiles.
CYCLONUS: The Autobots have been terminated!
GALVATRON: Excellent. And soon we shall say the same of that infernal Unicron. Suddenly, Galvatron's body begins to twist, and he writhes in pain.
ARCEE: Did we have to detonate three- quarters of the ship?!
SPRINGER: Seeing how they would have detonated four quarters, I think it was a good choice.
ULTRA MAGNUS: Perceptor..can you still locate the Junk Planet?
PERCEPTOR: Gamma waves in this sector of space create marginal navigation probabilities,
ULTRA MAGNUS: Holds his head in his hands as Springer
PERCEPTOR: Ahem...yes I think I can.

HOT ROD: He transforms and blasts.
THE SQUID: angrily streaks toward Hot Rod.
HOT ROD: Fires at the Squid, but not stopping him.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Hot Rod's shot plinks off a couple of tentacles, but the squid keeps coming.
THE SQUID: releases a laser print ink stream which boils out in the water in a series of dots and "x" shapes and retreats.
HOT ROD: Don't worry, I'm not coming after you.
HOT ROD: lowers his head and blows blast of air through head-piece. The air blast clears the water, revealing Kup's head and torso half buried in the "sand"
HOT ROD: Kup! Say something!
KUP: ( bubbling as he speaks ) Fix me!
HOT ROD: Sure, Kup..right away! Hot Rod rapidly
HOT ROD: Well.what do you think? Kup feels his elbow joint, twists his neck side to side and gets creaks and squeaks and moves legs in odd, creaky way as he is trying himself out.
KUP: ( a beat, then grimaces ) There's a piece missing.
HOT ROD: No way.. See, this wasn't yours.it's some kind of prehistoric ion cruncher..and this doohickey looks like a funky energon funnel. and this.

HOT ROD: Universal Greeting.
KUP: Watch. I'll have them eating out of my Or our faces.
HOT ROD: Or our faces.
KUP: Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong.
HOT ROD: ( mocking, mimicking ) Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong. The Sharkticons look interested.
SHARKTICONS: ( GROWL VERSION OF THE SAME THING ) They hold out the cubes and two of the Sharkticons take the Energon cubes, like dogs getting a treat. Then, the other six show up looking for cubes.

HOT ROD: This is getting expensive.
KUP: Don't worry, they'll reciprocate. They each hand out three Energon goodies to the remaining six Sharkticons. The Sharkticons eat them happily. Then, they back off, eyeing the two Autobots with I thought they were supposed to Customs vary from place to place. Suddenly, the Sharkticons transform to their vicious mode and lunge at them.
HOT ROD: I thought they were supposed to Customs vary from place to place. Suddenly, the Sharkticons transform to their vicious mode and lunge at them.
KUP: ( not sure of himself ) Customs vary from place to place. Suddenly, the Sharkticons transform to their vicious mode and lunge at them.
SHARKTICONS: Sharkticons march Kup and Hot Rod into a HOLDING PEN within a walled compound. As we FOLLOW THEM INTO PEN we PULL BACK and PAN to establish that entry procession is being watched by.
THE QUINTESSONS: slender, spindly framed robotic creatures with oversized five sided heads, each side bearing a different mechanistic face with a different expression on each - smiling, angry, grimacing, suspicious and the fifth face is not yet to be seen. As Hot Rod and Kup are led to certain death in the Quintesson dungeons, harsh, dissonant, metallic and terrifying music plays, underscoring the brutal evil they Reminds me of the Niter Slave Mines on Golgonath Seven..
HOT ROD: Every place reminds you of some place Experience, lad. You should learn to appreciate it.
HOT ROD: A lot of good it's done us so far!
HOT ROD: I can't transform!
KUP: They're restraining bolts, lad.
HOT ROD: ( looking around ) We got to get a new travel agent.. What is this place?
KRANIX: The world of the savage Sharkticons and their cruel masters the Quintessons. They hunt down those who try to escape the wrath of Unicron, and put them on But what if they're innocent?
KUP: But what if they're innocent?
KRANIX: Guilty or innocent, the sentence is always the same - death!
HOT ROD: Unicron?! Who's Unicron?
KRANIX: A planet six times the size of this one that absorbs everything in its path.
KUP: So that's the monster's name.
HOT ROD: I wonder if there's any connection between it and Galvatron.
QUINTESSON GUARD: Soon, you too shall receive your
LEAD QUINTESSON: Jury, have you reached a verdict?
JUROR #1: We have your honor.

SPRINGER: The place where everything ends up after you throw it out.
ULTRA MAGNUS: Brace for impact!
SPRINGER: ( pulling himself free of hull Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a raise. Daniel creeps out from under Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and dust off his shoulders
DANIEL: Wow! That was better'n the Roller Coaster at Future World!

SPRINGER: Yep, this dump is a dump..
ULTRA MAGNUS: as he straps on TOOL BELT
ULTRA MAGNUS: We might be able to salvage this thing. Ultra Magnus starts for door followed by Blurr who takes up a saw and tool belt and Perceptor who rolls up Shuttle Plans as Daniel moves out to join them
DANIEL: Can I help, too?
SPRINGER: It's rough out there, kid. Stay inside and play with crayons or something.
ARCEE: as she steps forward with a smile, a strange GRID LIKE "SUIT" in her hand
ARCEE: I think Daniel can make himself useful with..this! It used to be Spike's.
DANIEL: Wow! Dad's exo-suit. He told me about it but I never saw it.
ARCEE: Here, try it on.
ON DANIEL: as he gets inside the "suit" which fits over his body like a grid-work metal
SPRINGER: Just think about what you want to do before you do it!
DANIEL: brows knitted, thinking.
SPRINGER: Don't fight it Dan-O.
DANIEL: ( continuing ) It's kind of tricky..
ARCEE: For the first time out, you were great!

OTHER JUNKIONS: Yeah, or your money back! Wreck-Gar shows large JUNK GUN with all sorts of razor sharp fins and rusty little rocket missiles mounted around the howitzer like
QUINTESSON: Greetings, noble strangers.
GRIMLOCK: Yes, me, Grimlock, noble! Me, Grimlock search for friends.
QUINTESSON: And who might they be?
GRIMLOCK: Autobots. Hot Rod and Kup.
QUINTESSON: ( feigning recognition ) Oh yes. A young one and an old one.
GRIMLOCK: Yes. You know friends. Where are they?
QUINTESSON: They went down that path. He points to.
A PATH: It probably isn't lined with primroses, but it should be.
GRIMLOCK: GRIMLOCK You good friend to Grimlock. I reward you, sometime.
GALVATRON: Why do you torture me?!
UNICRON: You have failed.
GALVATRON: No, Unicron. Ultra Magnus is dead.
UNICRON: Then where is the matrix?
GALVATRON: Destroyed, with him.
UNICRON: The matrix can not be destroyed. And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of Junk. Stalk him. Cut him open! And bring the matrix to me.
SNAP!: It misses him by an inch.
GRIMLOCK: Me Grimlock, positive Hot Rod and Kup close! Get thump, thump, thump.
SLAG: Me, Slag say you are full of beryllium balony. He is just about to fall in
GRIMLOCK: Me, Grimlock, say you full of cesium salami! Slag gets up.
SLAG: Beryllium balony!
GRIMLOCK: ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK He is about to pounce on Slag when a massive tree, which is actually more like a sword, suddenly is spring and arcs toward him. The machete like blade strikes the ground, between Grimlock and Slag narrowly missing them. He turns and sees the thing stocking in the ground.
GRIMLOCK: Me, Grimlock think trees here are cheap Like your head! ( laughs at own joke ) Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him to the ground. Suddenly, a SQUEAKY, ODDLY CHILDISH VOICE speaks from o.s.

QUINTESSON JUDGE: Before we deliver your verdict, would you like to beg for your lives?
KUP: Remember when you put me together today?
HOT ROD: ( sarcastic ) Sure, that's all I got to think about.
KUP: I know what part you forgot.
HOT ROD: I have nothing but contempt for this
KUP: That doohickey you lost was part of my shoulder socket. Watch this, lad. without it, I'm double jointed as Wish you'd figured that out a little Better late than never!
HOT ROD: Wish you'd figured that out a little Better late than never!
KUP: Better late than never!
HOT ROD: They've got more Sharkticons than we have photon charges!
KUP: Let's hold a demolition derby! Then, he roars into a bunch of them, slamming a massive stack into the wall.
HOT ROD: Didn't even bend a fender.
KUP: Yeah, but look. There are a lot more of those cam dinging, grill-crackin' things.
HOT ROD: We can't hold out forever, but we can give them one whopper of a repair bill.
SUDDENLY: DINOBOTS ( O.S. ) ( WAR WHOOP )
GRIMLOCK: Lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller Sharkticon, the Sharkticon bares his teeth, realizes that he's a second stringer, and scampers away.
GRIMLOCK: Me Grimlock want to munch metal! Slag barrels into Sharkticons, making a quick shishkebob out of them, while.
THE SHARKTICONS: suddenly back off and begin transforming ( bowing ) to the dinobots.
HOT ROD: I never thought I'd be so happy to see those big bozos.
GRIMLOCK: Me Grimlock no bozo. Me king!
QUINTESSON JUDGE: Sharkticons! Execute them.
GRIMLOCK: Me Grimlock say execute them.
THE SHARKTICONS: for a brief instant, don't seem to know what to do. Then, they charge the The Quintessons start to flee, but it's clear that the Sharkticons, who climb over the stacked bodies of other Sharkticons, are going to catch them.
THE CHASE: The Quintessons start to flee, but it's clear that the Sharkticons, who climb over the stacked bodies of other Sharkticons, are going to catch them.
KUP: I think the problems on this planet will be solved very shortly.
HOT ROD: But what about our problems. We need a WHEELIE You get a ship if I get a trip.
WHEELIE: WHEELIE You get a ship if I get a trip.
HOT ROD: Who are you.
SLAG: Him Wheelie, him friend.
HOT ROD: HOT ROD He'll be mine too, if he can find a Quintesson ship.
HOT ROD: That's a ship?

SPIKE: We're being sucked into it!
PERCEPTOR: Be sure the fittings are securely welded!
BLURR: ( very fast, as usual ) Absolutely, positively, definitely.
DANIEL: This exo-suit is fantastic! Want me to do that?
BLURR: Weld? You? Really? Well, why not? Give it a try, but think it through first! Daniel knits his brow, extends FINGER OF EXO- GLOVE which is part of exo-suit.
BLURR: Practice, practice, practice!
ULTRA MAGNUS: as he, too, hears and then looks up and sees the Decepticon force
ULTRA MAGNUS: ( to Springer ) We've got to draw them off and then double back to the ship!

ULTRA MAGNUS: Then move it.
ULTRA MAGNUS: Stays behind, taking a few shots at.
SWEEPS: which streak over in deadly formations.
ULTRA MAGNUS: He stands and shoots.
ULTRA MAGNUS: Then use that time to escape! The Matrix was designed for an emergency like this. I'll try to unleash its power.
SPRINGER: But what if it doesn't work.
ULTRA MAGNUS: Until all are one!
ULTRA MAGNUS: Damn it! Open it!
ULTRA MAGNUS: ( baffled ) Prime, you said the Matrix would light our darkest hour.

ULTRA MAGNUS: You have ships here?
SPRINGER: What's he talking about?
SPRINGER: This is what I call traveling in style.
UNICRON: Aren't we getting pompous?

UNICRON'S STOMACH: This is the central processing area for Unicron's "food" and "energy." A long conveyer belt drops junk into a clear, bubbling vat, where it is separated into raw material and energy. The energy, which comes out in raw form, goes into a machine and is crunched into energon cubes, while the solid material, is separated into it's component metals and plastics, formed into ingots and sent elsewhere in an assembly line fashion.

GALVATRON: No, I will crush you with bare hands. Hot Rod transforms back to car and tries to race away. . Galvatron jumps after him and catches him. . Hot Rod, nearly pinned by Galvatron transforms to humanoid mode.
GALVATRON: First Prime, then Ultra Magnus and now you. It is a pity Autobots die so easily or I might have a sense of satisfaction now. Hot Rod desperately gasps and pulls at Galvatron's hands.

HOT ROD: ANGLE ON GALVATRON He fires at Hot Rod as.
GALVATRON: . Hot Rod gets up. . The shot doesn't even dent him.
HOT ROD: This is the end of the road, Galvatron. With that, he picks up the Decepticon and throws him through.
SPRINGER: I'm almost out of energy. Suddenly, he looks up and sees one of the creatures explode above
SPRINGER: That's what I call the nick of time.
JAZZ: Let's burn rubber!
KUP: I knew you had potential, lad!
RODIMUS PRIME: Autobots, transform and roll out. Rodimus Prime transforms into truck mode as the other Autobots also transform. Daniel and Spike jump into him. Then, in a continuous line, he shoots off, the other Autobots racing behind him.
BANG!: We get the big visual explosion.
RODIMUS PRIME: Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian wars as we move forward to a new age of peace and happiness..
ALL: Until all are one!
