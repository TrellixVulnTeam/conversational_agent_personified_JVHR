REVISED DRAFT: SUPER ON BLACK: LONGVIEW STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, TEXAS, 2003. FADE IN ON: INT. DEATH ROW/CELL - DAWN START TIGHT ON MARCUS WRIGHT. He's an intense, powerful man, 20's-30's, his head shaven. Marcus stares INTO CAMERA with a resigned expression. We hear the voice of a PRIEST:
PRIEST: Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art beside me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
SERENA: Marcus I'm Doctor Serena Kogan, I'm with Project Angel. You consented to donate your body to science.
MARCUS: Yeah, I'm pretty much done with it.
SERENA: You've been chosen for our research.
MARCUS: Chosen? Lucky me.
SERENA: We just need a couple of signatures.
MARCUS: You don't need to be scared.
SERENA: I'm not. It's nerve degeneration.
MARCUS: ( NODS ) You're not the only one with a death sentence.
SERENA: ( NODS ) You're not the only one with a death sentence.
MARCUS: I'm a regular hero.
SERENA: Thank you. And. I'm sorry.
MARCUS: No one lives forever.
PLASMA RIFLE: DROPPING A SOLDIER. His comrades FIRE EXPLOSIVE BULLETS and BLOW THE ROBOT APART. The LEADER of this assault group waves his soldiers to enter the dark hatchway.
TEAM LEADER: SOLDIERS move from cover and through the blown door.
TEAM LEADER: Oh God.
TEAM LEADER: You will not believe the shit we found down here
PILOT: repeat, that was not us! A ship escaped, they musta blown the place themselves! Jesus, a lot of our guys were still down there.
MARCUS: He unscrews the cap, raises the bottle to a SKELETON on the floor nearby. Marcus takes a long pull and CHOKES, instantly dizzy. He sinks to the floor, passing out.
MARCUS: Hey! Yo, over here!
BOY: Hey mister, where you goin' in such a hurry?
MARCUS: You're human. you can see me, you can touch me. This place is real.
BOY: ( raises an eyebrow ) This sure ain't heaven.
MARCUS: Those things with masks, red eyes
BOY: ( CASUALLY ) Terminators T-400s. What is this stuff?
MARCUS: If I'm not in hell, where am I?!
BOY: ( CHOKING )
GIRL: Let him go!
MARCUS: First put down the shotgun.
BOY: Do what he says.
GIRL: He'll kill us both!
MARCUS: I don't wanna kill anyone.
BOY: Do it, Star. Put it down.
GIRL: There was only one bullet in that gun.
MARCUS: I don't like it when people point guns at me.
GIRL: It wasn't loaded.
MARCUS: You took on a guy like me with one bullet and an empty shotgun? Pretty stupid.
GIRL: Can I have my gun back?
MARCUS: In the city.
BOY: ( steps away from him ) The city? Oh man. That place is red hot.
MARCUS: ( a small smile ) Seemed kinda dead to me.
BOY: No radiation.
MARCUS: That wasn't a helicopter.
BOY: It's an H-K hunter-killer. Where the hell have you been?
GIRL: Rads musta fried his brains. Let's go, Kyle.
KYLE: What's your name?
MARCUS: ( after a beat ) Marcus. Marcus Wright.
KYLE: Kyle Reese. She doesn't remember her name so I call her Star.
STAR: ( hissing at him ) Why? We don't need him.
KYLE: ( a shrug, sotto ) I like him. He's funny.
MARCUS: What year is it?
STAR: Nope. Eighteen.
KYLE: Nope. Eighteen.
STAR: Are you sure?
KYLE: Yup. Two thousand eighteen.
MARCUS: Fifteen years. I've lost 15 years. So who did it to us? Terrorists? The Russians, the Chinese?
STAR: The nukes. There was a war, right? Who started it?
MARCUS: The nukes. There was a war, right? Who started it?
KYLE: Something fall on your head? The machines did it, the computers they got smart.
STAR: Judgment Day. I was just a baby.
KYLE: What's the last thing you remember?
MARCUS: ( a beat )
KYLE: Eyeball. Only one.
STAR: KYLE and STAR dash for the fast-food entrance, MARCUS just behind. They round the doorway and
MARCUS: That flying grapefruit, what was it?
KYLE: Aerostat one of Skynet's eyes. They patrol places like this, looking for survivors.
STAR: She's come up with some UNOPENED PACKETS OF CONDIMENTS from a bag of TRASH. KYLE trots over.
KYLE: Any red ones?
STAR: MARCUS picks up the packet, looks at it.
MARCUS: Jalape√±o sauce.
STAR: You can read.
KYLE: So can I. Well, sort of. a little.
STAR: Want some?
MARCUS: No thanks. Not hungry.
KYLE: Never heard anyone say that before.
MARCUS: I look the same.
KYLE: You ever watch television?
MARCUS: Oh yeah. Was about all I ever had to look forward to in the joint.
STAR: ( YAWNING ) What's a joint?
MARCUS: ( BLINKS ) Prison. Spent half my life there.
KYLE: I remember TV a little. Cartoons. It was great.
MARCUS: She your sister?
KYLE: Dunno. Been together since we was little. Bunch of us kids was at the day-care center when the bombs fell. she and me are the only ones still around.
MARCUS: ( disturbed; gestures around ) So this is it? Your life?
KYLE: We're gonna find the Resistance, fight for John Connor against Skynet. You oughta join us, you're pretty cool.
MARCUS: You don't know me.
KYLE: You're strong, you can read. you didn't kill us. Good enough for me.
MARCUS: Skynet runs the machines.? So who's this John Connor?
KYLE: He's. I don't know. The best. Everybody talks about him. He's the one who's gonna save us.
MARCUS: Yeah, right. Him and Jesus.
KYLE: Who's Jesus?
MARCUS: You're asking the wrong guy.
KYLE: ( closing his eyes ) So why were you in prison?
MARCUS: ( a long beat ) I killed a cop.
KYLE: Were cops like terminators?
MARCUS: Well. Nah, some of `em were all right.
KYLE: You gonna be here when I wake up?
MARCUS: Good. Stay away from the windows.
KYLE: Good. Stay away from the windows.
STAR: Just me.
MARCUS: The bible. My grandma always tried to get me into it, but it always put me to sleep.
STAR: Would you read something to me?
MARCUS: ".of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son Jephunneh"
STAR: There's a book inside with pictures.
MARCUS: "Guaranteed lowest prices. open seven days."
STAR: What's that?
MARCUS: It's a flower. A rose.
STAR: ( full of wonder ) So. all those numbers. you could call them and get, like, flowers, or someone to come over and fix stuff, or bring you food.
MARCUS: ( nods, touched ) Guess people had it pretty good.
STAR: You know, pianos, guitars.
MARCUS: You know, pianos, guitars.
STAR: I don't remember music.
MARCUS: Come on. You must. "I can't get no. satisfaction." "We are family. I got all my sisters with me." No, huh. How about. "Twinkle twinkle little star."
MARCUS: You OK?
STAR: ( shakes her head ) Somebody used to sing that to me.
KYLE: If we get it to move, will you teach me to make it go?
MARCUS: It's called driving. Sure.
STAR: Wow. What were these like?
MARCUS: ( SMILING ) Not too many around in my time.
STAR: THE JEEP is suddenly PUSHED from the carport, tires somewhat inflated. MARCUS is on one side of the rear, KYLE on the other, STAR behind the wheel, the seat moved all the way up.
MARCUS: Pop the clutch! Let your foot up!
KYLE: Aerostat's coming!
STAR: Sort of.
MARCUS: Sort of.
STAR: Oh no! It's gonna call a Harvester, we're dead
KYLE: Wow. You're good.
STAR: No! You're doing fine.
MARCUS: No! You're doing fine.
RADIO VOICE: proper ratio of ammonium nitrate to diesel fuel. A bomb of this type can be contained in an ordinary plastic garbage bag, and will detonate on impact.
KYLE: ( EXCITED ) That's him!
RADIO VOICE: This recording has described booby- traps and explosive devices. It will repeat every two hours on different frequencies to avoid Skynet jamming.
MARCUS: Stop the car.
RADIO VOICE: Do not give in to despair. As bleak as things seem, I assure you, humanity will triumph.
KYLE: We oughta find a place to hole up for the day.
MARCUS: Damn it. Empty.
KYLE: You smell that?
STAR: They both hop out of the Jeep, running toward the GARAGE, each carrying their unloaded GUNS.
MARCUS: What is this?
KYLE: ( mouth full ) Who cares?
MARCUS: Spit it out!
STAR: ( CHEWING ) It's good!
COW: Not much meat on `em.
PIG: This one's fi-i-ine
MARCUS: MARCUS yanks the gun away and tosses it aside, HEAD-BUTTS Pig, who staggers backward, BLOOD SPRAYING from his nose.
PIG: We didn't kill `em! I swear to God, they was dead already, we wasn't gonna let `em rot
BULL: Go `head, take as much as you want, we're on the same side here
SUDDENLY: CANNON FIRE RIPS through the towering HARVESTER, blowing its thorax to PIECES, barely MISSING MARCUS.
MARCUS: Name's Marcus.
BLAIR: You can put me down now, Marcus.
MARCUS: I'm heading that way.
BLAIR: ( a short laugh ) The hot zone? No you're not.
MARCUS: I've got to get to my friends
BLAIR: What friends?
MARCUS: Couple of kids. They were in that flying dumpster
BLAIR: The Skynet transport? It was carrying people? Christ, we almost shot it down. There've been rumors about a concentration camp, but.
MARCUS: They can't see, but they have killer sonar. They'll attack anything that moves or makes a sound. Even if you get past them, you'd be dead before you covered a hundred yards. If the terminators don't get you, the fallout will heavy rads all the way to the Gulf coast, nothing can live there.
BLAIR: They can't see, but they have killer sonar. They'll attack anything that moves or makes a sound. Even if you get past them, you'd be dead before you covered a hundred yards. If the terminators don't get you, the fallout will heavy rads all the way to the Gulf coast, nothing can live there.
MARCUS: You're with the Resistance.
BLAIR: Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what used to be the Air National Guard.
MARCUS: I don't know. this has gotta be some kind of, like, dream or hallucination. Like what happens to people right before they die.
BLAIR: That snap you out of it?
BLAIR: So let me get this straight, Marcus. There you are on death row, they stick a needle in your arm.
MARCUS: Let's hear it.
BLAIR: Whatever they pumped into your veins just knocked you out. This Angel Project you signed up for there was a lotta cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs fell, they musta froze your ass.
MARCUS: What the hell for?
BLAIR: Drug tests, medical experiments, organ harvesting, who knows? You said you had no family, no friends why let a body like yours go to waste?
MARCUS: I've never seen trees like these.
BLAIR: We're in a mutation zone. I saw a two-headed squirrel here once
MARCUS: ( SHRUGS ) Tasted like chicken.
BLAIR: ( SHRUGS ) Tasted like chicken.
MARCUS: What was that?
BLAIR: I didn't hear anything
MARCUS: They're surrounding us.
BLAIR: They're smart. And they don't scare easy.
MARCUS: Dog eat dog world.
BLAIR: BLAIR sighs, yawns, sits against a tree.
MARCUS: Staf? What's that mean?
BLAIR: It's a resistance term. Sit tight and fuck.
MARCUS: I'm not gay. In prison, I thought about puss women all the time. But now. it's not working. Who knows, all those years on ice.
BLAIR: Maybe it's just gonna take some time. Before you're completely thawed out.
MARCUS: I dunno. They just. sorta reminded me of her.
BLAIR: MARCUS speaks carefully, unsure how to articulate this.
MARCUS: There's a woman, the last woman I saw before. when I was under, the dead time she kept coming to me. I think she must've saved me.
BLAIR: I can't compete with that.
KYLE: We've landed.
STAR: What's going to happen to us?
KYLE: I don't know.
MARCUS: We're in somebody's garden.
BLAIR: Christ. there's supposed to be barbed wire along the edge.
MARCUS: Over there.
BLAIR: Whatever you do, don't move.
BARNES: Somebody feed those things!
MORRISON: Start up the generator, Barnes.
LISA: We got company!
BARNES: Blair? Good to see you. What's the password?
BLAIR: Eat shit and die, Barnes!
BARNES: Close enough. Who's your friend?
BLAIR: Could you get us outta here please?
BARNES: Kinda dumb-ass, wandering around in a mine field.
BLAIR: You didn't maintain the perimeter! Where are your sentries?
BARNES: It's too early for that military crap.
BLAIR: You goddamn idiot!
BARNES: He was takin' bigger steps!
MORRISON: Son of a bitch is heavy.
JANE: He stepped on a Claymore? This guy oughta be in a hundred pieces.
BLAIR: What are you doing?
JANE: Does he have a prosthetic limb?
BLAIR: I don't think so.
JANE: This is not skin. oh Jesus oh God
SERENA: Why isn't he conscious? Something's wrong, he should be coming out of it by now.
MARCUS: INT. OUTPOST/BARRACKS & COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY CLOSE ON X-RAYs of MARCUS' TORSO and LIMBS clearly mechanical gears, steel plating, hydraulics, etc.
JANE: Thermoplastic skin, some larger hydraulics, but mostly titanium microgears. This looks like some sort of aeration and hydration system, function unclear at this point. Valves and what looks like an access panel below the ribcage.
BLAIR: Whatever he is he's on our side
MORRISON: How can he be?
BLAIR: He saved my life!
MORRISON: Winning your trust would aid his
LISA: Regional doesn't know what to do. They're gonna patch us through to Command Los Angeles.
NANCY: How could you bring this monster here?! This is our home! Our children
BLAIR: What do you want from me I didn't know!
KID: It's awake!
MARCUS: Get me the hell down from here!
BARNES: Shut up! I told you to shut up!
BLAIR: Leave him alone! Marcus, I'm so sorry.
BARNES: It keeps talkin' at me. God this thing gives me the creeps.
MARCUS: Why are you doing this? What is this place?
MORRISON: We're trying to
NANCY: ( over him ) Don't say anything! It's probably uplinked to Skynet.
MORRISON: Then it's already too late. This used to be an ICBM silo, we're just trying to stay alive here. Your turn where'd you come from?
MARCUS: Corpus Christi. It's in Texas. Or it was.
BARNES: ( AMAZED ) It sounds completely human. it really could pass.
JANE: Didn't John Connor say they'd start building things like this?
MORRISON: Not yet not for years. So, you're programmed with false memories, a human history
MARCUS: What are you talking about?
MORRISON: You can skip the act, we know what you are.
NANCY: Why are you even speaking to it?!
BARNES: She's right, let's just waste the damn thing
NANCY: It'll kill us all if we give it a
CHANCE: During the above, other KIDS and ADULTS IN BG AD LIB "Kill it," "Goddamn robot," etc. increasing mob anger, until
MARCUS: I'm a man!
LISA: Regional got through to CLA they want us to rig a video feed. He wants to see him.
MORRISON: Who does?
LISA: John Connor.
MARCUS: So this guy is what, like king of the world, or what's left of it?
MORRISON: John Connor founded the Resistance. When the war began, no one even knew who the enemy was Connor taught us how to fight back. He saved humanity.
MARCUS: Yeah, well, humanity's never done all that much for me. Why can't I see him?
MORRISON: Nobody sees him. Skynet can't be allowed to discover his location, even his appearance is kept secret.
CONNOR'S VOICE: hello standing by
LISA: Sir, we can hear you, sir, working on a visual, sir.
CONNOR: Not what I expected.
CONNOR'S VOICE: It does seem lifelike is the face able to mimic emotions?
MARCUS: This shit is ridiculous. What the hell do you want from me?
CONNOR: ( STUNNED ) I I need to know what you are.
MARCUS: So do I! I don't know what I am, what I'm doing here, I don't know shit maybe I never did, but I'm sick of it! Just blow my head off or let me go.
CONNOR: This isn't right. I can't be having a conversation with a terminator, Skynet isn't that sophisticated yet. Unless. were you sent here from the future?
MARCUS: ( very confused ) Skynet's developing a time displacement field, we've decrypted recent data transmissions.
CONNOR: Skynet's developing a time displacement field, we've decrypted recent data transmissions.
MARCUS: You're out of your mind, aren't you?
CONNOR'S VOICE: Jesus. I've seen enough. Stand by for further instructions.
KATE: He's not a cyborg no blood, no human tissue over the endoskeleton.
CONNOR: Besides, the first T-800s won't be manufactured until `26.
ADVISOR #1: Maybe he's a one-off, an experiment.
ADVISOR #2: Let's hope. If there are more out there like him, we're in serious trouble. Christ, a terminator with attitude.
KATE: Where did they find him?
ADVISOR #1: East-central Texas, near an area of heavy Skynet concentration. The outpost where they're holding him is reasonably secure, but it's not much more than a commune.
CONNOR: I want him extracted.
ADVISOR #1: Done. What then?
CONNOR: Get him to our best people for disassembly, find out what makes him tick. We need to get into that metal skull, crack his CPU at all costs.
KATE: Because people trust you. you give them faith
CONNOR: No. Because I knew I would be, I was told. I know when and where the major battles are going to take place. I know I'm going to send my own father back through time to save my mother even though I haven't met him yet. Christ, I even know the year I'm going to die.
KATE: So how could I not know about this?!
JOHN: So how could I not know about this?!
CONNOR: So how could I not know about this?!
MARCUS: Feels like I been here before. what are you gonna do to me?
MORRISON: Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a chopper seems you're some kind of VIP.
KYLE: We're stopping.
STAR: I'm scared.
KYLE: ( hugging her ) Whatever happens, we stick together.
MARCUS: Hello? Anyone there?
BARNES: ( SNICKERING ) Want some motor oil?
MARCUS: I need water.
BARNES: Bullshit. Machines don't drink.
MARCUS: Please, I'm
BARNES: Shut up, robot!
BLAIR: How's it going, Barnes? Thought you might like a late-night snack.
BARNES: Where in hell'd you get these?
BLAIR: We got a stash back at the base.
BARNES: Kinda stale.
BLAIR: You need something to wash it down.
BARNES: I'm on duty, you know.
BLAIR: You know I always liked you, Barnes. I just didn't want to join the harem.
BARNES: What can I say? It's our duty to repopulate the planet.
BLAIR: Noble of you to make the sacrifice.
BARNES: He pulls her close to him for a kiss. After a moment, she pulls away and moves to the corridor entrance. There's a large SLIDING STEEL DOOR here.
BLAIR: I prefer a little privacy.
BARNES: You're so twentieth century.
BLAIR: Men. You're all talk.
MARCUS: Why are you doing this?
BLAIR: I don't believe you're a terminator.
MARCUS: So what am I.?
BLAIR: Whatever you are I owe you one. Once you're free, I'll lie down next to Barnes they'll assume you escaped while we were passed out
MARCUS: You think they'll buy that?
BLAIR: Worth a shot. Marcus, Command wants to take you apart, cut open your head. One thing I know, you're alive and you've got a right to live.
BLAIR: They're already here for you
MARCUS: I'm heading across the river.
BLAIR: No human being can survive there
MARCUS: I'm not human, remember?
BLAIR: You're gonna try and save those kids.
MARCUS: It's the only thing I can think of that makes any sense.
BLAIR: Marcus, for all you know, they're dead already
MARCUS: For all I know, they're the reason I'm back from the dead.
BLAIR: Damn it, we're too late
MARCUS: Where's that go?
BLAIR: Should lead out, but there's no way past the fan
BLAIR: Here. My ELT emergency locator transmitter. If you find the camp, activate it like this. It could really help the Resistance.
MARCUS: Thank you.
CONCRETE: SHRAPNEL hits MARCUS in the back, he's thrown into the ventilation shaft
MARCUS: Don't mention it.
CONNOR: I need to talk to the prisoner.
CONNOR: Lieutenant Williams. I'm sorry about the way you've been treated, but we're forced to take every precaution. I'm John Connor.
BLAIR: At ease. Please, sit.
CONNOR: At ease. Please, sit.
BLAIR: Sir he isn't a terminator. He's We know he's crossed into Skynet territory, why would he do that if he isn't
CONNOR: We know he's crossed into Skynet territory, why would he do that if he isn't
BLAIR: He's trying to find his friends.
CONNOR: What friends?
BLAIR: A couple of kids. They were taken in a Skynet transport, probably to some kind of prison camp he said their names were Star and Kyle.
CONNOR: Blair picks up on his interest, but doesn't understand it.
BLAIR: Mm. Kyle something. With an `R.'
CONNOR: That's it. How did you.?
BLAIR: That's it. How did you.?
KATE: What is it, John?
CONNOR: I always knew I'd have to find him someday. I just didn't know how.
KATE: What? Find who?
CONNOR: My father.
STAR: Oh no, oh no.
KYLE: Shh, keep singing.
STAR: Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky.
KYLE: Stop it stop it STOP IT!
JEREMY: Are you all right?
MARCUS: What the hell is this?
JEREMY: You look like you've been hit by a truck
MARCUS: Among other things. Look, I'm trying to find some friends a couple of kids. They were taken here, I saw some buildings
JEREMY: The facility, sure. Hop in, I'll take you there.
MARCUS: Jeremy clutches Marcus' hand tightly. Marcus blinks, Jeremy cocks his head, then lets go.
JEREMY: I can't connect with you at all. your interface must've been damaged. Don't worry, soon they'll have you as good as new.
MARCUS: I didn't think there was anything like this left. anywhere.
JEREMY: Yes. We're very lucky. Want some?
MARCUS: This isn't food.
JEREMY: Well, of course not. Seems you got a little memory loss going on.
MARCUS: Jeremy winces, as if at a racial epithet. He's starting to regret giving Marcus a lift, his manner is careful, as if he'd picked up some homeless guy.
JEREMY: We don't call them that here.
MARCUS: What are you?
JEREMY: A hybrid. The same as you.
MARCUS: A hybrid human and machine?
JEREMY: Of course. That's what this community is for people like us.
MARCUS: Jesus. why?
JEREMY: You should be grateful to have been What about the ones who weren't?
MARCUS: What about the ones who weren't?
JEREMY: You mean like Janet and the kids.
MARCUS: Your family. You lost them?
JEREMY: `Cause I feel good. The interface recognizes negative emotions rage, grief, despair and stimulates positive endorphins in response. Thank God, life would be pretty unbearable otherwise, don't you think?
MARCUS: Tell me everything. How did you people get here?
JEREMY: Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA. I was an engineer on Project Angel
MARCUS: Angel what is it?
JEREMY: Advanced Nexus of Genetic and Electronic Life-forms. A-N-G-E-L. You can stop choking me, it's not like I need to breathe.
MARCUS: ( sighs, slowly ) The goal was a superior support system for the human brain to go anywhere, do anything explore deep space, the bottom of the sea. I specialized in optics.
JEREMY: ( sighs, slowly ) The goal was a superior support system for the human brain to go anywhere, do anything explore deep space, the bottom of the sea. I specialized in optics.
ENGINEER: 32578 - acceptable. 32579 - no, insufficient neural capacity. 32580 - eh, this one shouldn't have even been brought here.
SERENA: ( CONTINUED )
MARCUS: ( DISGUSTED ) It's a graveyard.
SERENA: There was no choice the old civilization had to be eliminated. To make way for a new world. a world without death or suffering.
AIDE: Sir, I'm sorry to disturb you, but you said you wanted to know immediately
CONNOR: What is it?
AIDE: We found our terminator.
NAVAL OFFICER: There can't be any prisoners there. The whole area's a nuclear wasteland only machines can survive the radiation levels for any length of time.
CONNOR: Mobilize a combined air and naval assault, all available resources. We're sending in a rescue team ASAP.
KATE: All to find one teenage boy.? John, you really think this can work?
CONNOR: I'm standing here, I exist so it must have worked. We will find him.
SERENA: Calm down, Marcus. It's all right.
MARCUS: Like fuck it is. I'm sick of being your guinea pig, what are you doing to me now?!
SERENA: Repairing you.
MARCUS: You all work for Skynet!
SERENA: Please. Skynet works for us. It's only a program a tool, a means to an end.
MARCUS: The end of the world.
SERENA: Its sole purpose is to protect humanity.
MARCUS: Into this? A brain in a box?
SERENA: Skynet had access to the entire defense web including Project Angel. It determined hybrids were the only path to salvation.
MARCUS: Destroying the human race in order to save it.
SERENA: When the resistance attacked our installation, we were forced to self-destruct. We would have taken you with us, but we thought you were in a permanent coma.
MARCUS: No, stop. I don't want it! You're dead inside, all of you!
SERENA: We're immortal. No sane person would choose to live in pain, forever. Soon you'll understand.
SERENA: How are you feeling, Marcus?
MARCUS: I'm not sure I know how to describe it.
SERENA: It's called happiness. You've been angry all your life. You don't know what it's like to feel. a part of something.
SPFX MONTAGE: FLYING POV, THROUGH BANKS OF CLOUDS, RICH COLORS in the sky, glinting GOLDEN LIGHT
SERENA: Pure ecstasy. we can share in it When I was a kid my grandmother would go on about heaven. it always sounded so boring.
MARCUS: When I was a kid my grandmother would go on about heaven. it always sounded so boring.
SERENA: Were you bored just now?
SERENA: Nanotechnology, polymimetic metals. working with Skynet, we're making amazing breakthroughs, well beyond anything possible before Judgment Day.
SERENA: We've already freed ourselves from biological limits. soon we'll transcend the laws of physics.
MARCUS: A time machine. Connor was right.
SERENA: ( sudden interest ) The Resistance leader? You know him?
MARCUS: .I've just heard him speak.
SERENA: He's a dangerous man. Delusional. He thinks he's a savior, but all he's really fighting for is. death.
MARCUS: In the world outside the survivors think Skynet is the enemy, out to destroy them. Why don't you tell them about all this?
SERENA: Not everyone can become like us, Marcus. We just don't have the resources to sustain more than a few thousand hybrids.
MARCUS: Then why. Some people I knew were picked up, taken here.
SERENA: A boy and a girl in the last day or two?
MARCUS: Yes. what is this place?
SERENA: Part of the neural net human minds linked directly with artificial intelligence. The processing power of the human brain is still beyond anything Skynet can manufacture.
MARCUS: That's them.
SERENA: Good news. He'll soon be part of the network you'll be able to connect with him.
MARCUS: Of course. I. I understand.
SERENA: I don't know I have to go. Will you be all right? Of course you will.
HEAD: MARCUS grits his teeth, this is incredibly hard to do, but
MARCUS: I need to go back!
PHYSICIST: The wormholing fluctuates, right now it's oscillating between three and six hours
MARCUS: What do I do?
PHYSICIST: Just breach the sphere. But you could materialize anywhere in a mile radius
ENGINEER: 32581 looks good. 32582. hm, borderline. May not be emotionally compatible. Pass.
MARCUS: Let them go.
ENGINEER: What? Who are you?
MARCUS: I said, let them go!
ENGINEER: You can't hurt me.
MARCUS: Now you're pissing me off.
KYLE: He climbs off his tray, takes her in his arms. She starts Around them, the dozen OTHER PRISONERS are getting to their feet, surprised at their sudden freedom.
STAR: Around them, the dozen OTHER PRISONERS are getting to their feet, surprised at their sudden freedom.
KYLE: The two kids hurry to him, Marcus hands Star her BASEBALL CAP, rescued from the trash. As she puts it on:
STAR: I knew you'd come.
MARCUS: We've gotta get out of here.
MARCUS: Stay down!
KYLE: Watch me!
STAR: That looked like
MARCUS: I know. Long story.
MARCUS: The trees!
STAR: ( NODDING ) Why don't you drive?
KYLE: Come on I was doing good!
KYLE: Where are we going?
MARCUS: ( CONTINUED )
KYLE: He's not real.
STAR: Don't come any closer!
MARCUS: I'm sorry.
MARCUS: There are more prisoners, a complex about a mile in
KYLE: Kyle Reese.
CONNOR: John Connor. I'm glad you made it.
MARCUS: Yeah, well. Get in line.
DOCTOR: Does this hurt?
MARCUS: I don't feel a thing. Help somebody else.
KATE: Your dad he seems like a nice kid.
CONNOR: The last boatload is right behind me. Skynet's pouring in reinforcements, we can't hold this place. And the people in the houses, they won't leave
MARCUS: They're not people anymore.
SERENA: Why, Marcus? You were immortal.
MARCUS: No one lives forever.

BLAIR: Marcus. I need to head back to my
MARCUS: I have no idea. I should be dead.
STAR: But you're alive.

MARCUS: Yeah, simpler to keep it man versus
STAR: ( BEAT ) What did it feel like? To be. one of them?
MARCUS: ( thoughtful beat ) Better than anything. Everything made sense. For the first time in my life, I felt. right. It was heaven.
BLAIR: How could you give that up?
MARCUS: I never really believed in heaven.
BLAIR: Here. You need these more than I do.
KATE: He wants to see you.
CONNOR: Her name was Sarah. she was. I don't remember my mother.
KYLE: I don't remember my mother.
CONNOR: Keep it.
KATE: Kyle, could you give us a minute?
MARCUS: You're asking me to become.
CONNOR: You must.
KATE: ( QUIETLY ) We can't keep him alive much longer. ( shakes her head, swallows ) Very few people know what John actually looks like. Only the technicians and our closest advisors need ever know the truth.
MARCUS: Why me?
KATE: Who else? Only you know the enemy from the inside. You liberated a Skynet camp. you're a hero.
CONNOR: I never knew how I was supposed to win this war. But I finally understand: the idea of John Connor is more important than the person. I can die. He cannot.
KATE: Please. We need you.
