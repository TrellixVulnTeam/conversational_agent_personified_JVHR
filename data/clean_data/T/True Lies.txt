JAMES CAMERON: TITLE SEQUENCE 1 EXT. MOUNTAINS, NEAR GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - NIGHT The snow covered Alps stand out clearly in the light of a full moon. A fortress-like CHATEAU is situated in a flat saddle of forest partway up the mountain, next to a frozen lake. The property is surrounded by high stone walls, and the stately grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards with dogs.

Gib hands his MP-5K machine gun to Faisil and reaches up to Harry, who grabs his hand and pulls. Harry tumbles down into the snowbank. He stands, brushing snow off his tux, and clomps toward the van in his ski-boots. He is completely unruffled.

HELEN: ( barely listening ) That's fabulous Harry.
HARRY: Yeah, it was wild.
GIB: Come any closer I'll kill you.
HELEN: The plumber came yesterday. He said they have to dig under the slab or something and it's going to be six hundred dollars to fix.

DANA: ( yelling over the Can't stop, I'm late. Bye, Dad!
GIB: Kids. Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
HARRY: She knows not to steal. I've taught her better than that.
GIB: Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen. Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.
SECRETARY: Morning, Mr. Tasker.
HARRY: Morning, Charlene.
GIB: See, kids now are ten years ahead of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a Don't be ridiculous. She's only how old is she?
HARRY: Don't be ridiculous. She's only how old is she?
GIB: Fourteen, Harry.

HARRY: Will you just open the door!
GIB: Or drugs.
GIB: Twenty here, fifty there. I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
HARRY: I thought you moved out.
GIB: Well . . . I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement. Don't change the subject. you owe me two hundred bucks.
JANICE: Gentlemen, please idenitify yourselves to the scanner.
HARRY: Harry Tasker. One zero zero two Albert Gibson. Three four nine nine one.
GIB: Albert Gibson. Three four nine nine one.
JANICE: Thank you. You are cleared.
GIB: Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
JANICE: Ten, Mr. Gibson.
GIB: And you still reach for your piece every time.
JANICE: Yes sir.
GIB: God! You have no idea how much that turns me on. I've never had the courage to say this before but. I love you, Janice.
JANICE: Yes, sir.
HARRY: You better watch it. She might file on you for sexual In her dreams.
GIB: In her dreams.
HARRY: Come on, Fize. We're late for our butt-grinding.
TRILBY: Jesus, Harry! You guys really screwed the pooch last night. Please tell me how I can look at this, that it's not a total pooch- Total is a strong word
HARRY: Total is a strong word
GIB: There are degrees of totality.
FAISIL: It's a scale really, with "perfect mission" on one end and "total pooch-screw" on the other and we're more about here
TRILBY: Faisil. You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
FAISIL: So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
TRILBY: So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
FAISIL: Sorry, sir. Uh. here's what we
FAISIL: Jamal Khaled. We think he's dirty so we raid his financial files. Check it out.
FAISIL: One hundred million in wire transfers from the COMMERCE BANK
INTERNATIONAL: Which we all know is a front for certain nations to fund terrorist activities. Something big is going down
GIB: Which we all know is a front for certain nations to fund terrorist activities. Something big is going down
FAISIL: And we know that a week ago four MIRV warheads were smuggled out of the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan . . .
HARRY: We think Khaled's group has bought the nukes and is bringing them to U.S. soil.
TRILBY: So far this is not blowing my skirt up, gentleman. Do you have anything remotely substantial? Don't be pumping beets up my ass here. Do you have hard data?
HARRY: Not what you'd call rock hard.
GIB: It's pretty limp, actually.
TRILBY: Then perhaps you better get some . before somebody parks a car in front of the White House with a nuclear weapon in the trunk!
HELEN: I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything. He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out. But he acts like he's curing cancer or So I guess you didn't get away for the weekend after all?
ALLISON: So I guess you didn't get away for the weekend after all?
HELEN: Are you kidding? Harry had to go out of town.
ALLISON: I'm shocked.
HELEN: Yeah. You know Harry.
BRAD: Helen, have you pulled those files yet? I need them by lunch.
HELEN: I won't let you down, Brad.
HELEN: ( under her breath ) You little pencil-neck. ( to Allison ) So. yo. sista! D'you do anything interesting?
ALLISON: Oh. Eric and I drove up to this little romantic inn, and. pretty much lapped champagne out of each other's navels for two You bitch.
HELEN: You bitch.
ALLISON: Girlfriend, you got a man. You just have to take control . . . set up the right mood.
HELEN: Harry only has two moods: busy. and asleep.
ALLISON: Then you better do something to jumpstart that man's motor. You know. wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
HARRY: What'ya got?
FAISIL: ( handing Harry a Here, check this out
GIB: It's a two million dollar disbursement from Khaled to. Juno Skinner. Uh huh. The babe at the party.
HARRY: It doesn't mean anything. She buys antiquities for Khaled.
GIB: Nope. The art buys are in a separate ledger.
FAISIL: And this is a little above market- rate for the horizontal bop, even for a total biscuit like her.
HARRY: Alright, I want a complete workup on her. Do we know where she is?
FAISIL: Uh huh. Right here in river You're kidding.
HARRY: You're kidding.
FAISIL: She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices
GIB: Sounds like a job for a
HELEN: I need you to talk to Dana. The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
HARRY: I'll handle it.
HARRY: Dana, Mr. Hardy called. Why weren't you in class today?
DANA: He lies! I was there! I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
HARRY: You seem fine now.
DANA: Great! You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
HARRY: I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady. You never used to lie to me. But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and Dana, are you listening to me?
HARRY: Dana, are you listening to me?
DANA: Yeah, Dad.
HARRY: You know you can always talk to me. Right? Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll Okay, Dad.
DANA: Okay, Dad.
HARRY: You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, I'm not a pumpkin! Okay?!! Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything
DANA: I'm not a pumpkin! Okay?!! Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything
HELEN: ( macho voice ) "I'll handle it".
GIB: It's all set up. ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist. Okay, reality check. Go.
HARRY: Hi, I'm Harry Renquist. I own a

HARRY: That's right. They want something. dramatic. I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
JUNO: So what did these. people. say about me exactly?
HARRY: Let's see. that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words. And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
JUNO: Those wimps. It's because I use my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike. I told you to move those crates an hour ago. Come on guys, let's get going. You see, a lot of these pieces are from ancient Persia. Unfortunately, ancient Persia is twenty feet under the sand of Iran, Iraq and Syria. Not the most popular places lately. So I've had to become an expert in international diplomacy.

JUNO: Well, do you see anything you like, Mr. Renquist?
HARRY: She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
GIB: She could be moving money, guns. And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the ghost numbers. They were checking out the Renquist front.
FAISIL: And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the ghost numbers. They were checking out the Renquist front.

MALIK: You stupid undisciplined bitch!
JUNO: It's a good thing you pay me Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now? Your phones are almost certainly tapped. And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a

GIB: Yeah, right.
HARRY: He enters the stone doorway of the tomb. FOLLOWING HARRY as he steps into the inner chamber. There is an oil-lamp burning on a stone sarcophagus, the only light. The room appears empty. REVERSE ON HARRY. Behind him a figure emerges from a shadowed alcove. It is Juno. She looks ethereal in the strange light.
JUNO: Hello, Harry.
JUNO: Do you like my tomb? The museum financing fell out, so I thought your clients might be interested.
HARRY: It's certainly. dramatic.
JUNO: Especially in this light. This is the only light they had then, so I like to study it this way. I love this place. I love all Is that why you got into this
HARRY: Is that why you got into this
JUNO: I've always been a collector at heart. When I see something I want, I have to have it.
HARRY: And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
JUNO: Yes, I do.
GIB: Harry, this is your conscience Look at this. People who dies twenty centuries ago.
JUNO: Look at this. People who dies twenty centuries ago.
JUNO: They breathed and loved and wept, just like us. And now their ideals, their religions, their social orders. are gone like mist. What did any of it matter?
JUNO: I only hope they lived well. That they got what they wanted.
JUNO: Getting what you want is the only important thing.

HARRY: No. We need this lead. Unit Seven.
HARRY: ( into Rover ) I need you at the Georgetown mall in three minutes.
SEVEN: Copy that. We're rolling.
GIB: Helen's going to be pissed.
HARRY: See, that's the problem with terrorists. They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
HARRY: Test two three. Pull over here.
GIB: ( in his ear ) You don't smoke, dickhead.
HARRY: ( apparently mumbling to Gonna try to get a closer shot of Beavis & Butthead.
GIB: There's another guy, still in the Stay on him.

GIB: Helen? Hi, it's Gib. Harry remembered something he left at the office. You know Harry.
HELEN: Yeah, Gib. I know Harry.
HELEN: Where are you going?
DANA: Out. If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
HELEN: No you're not. You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
DANA: Mom, wake up! Dad barely knows we exist.
HELEN: That's not true, honey
DANA: It is true! He doesn't know anything about me. He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something. As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine. But it's not fine. Nothing's fine.
HELEN: Dana! Come back here!
GIB: Oh shit. Harry, I lost the third guy.
GIB: Harry? Harry, you copy?! Shit!
HARRY: ( to the old guy )
FREEZE!!!: Malik spins to see Gib nearby, going into a firing stance behind a light-standard. The terrorist doesn't hesitate. His Beretta ROARS at 900 rounds per minute. Gib tries to hide behind the light-standard, which is about half as wide as he is. Shots hit all around him, shattering window glass behind him. His stomach sticks out from behind the pole. He sucks it in. Now his butt is sticking out on the other side. Shots clang into the steel column, and riddle everything behind him.
GIB: WRONG! THIS IS NOT GOOD!
HARRY: Get back to the car!
HARRY: Federal Officer in pursuit of suspect! Sorry.
GIB: Harry, what's your twenty?
HARRY: Westbound in the park. suspect is on a motorcycle. he's going to come out on Franklin. Hang
GIB: Copy that.
HARRY: And make it fast. My horse is getting tired.
HARRY: Can you just press the top floor,
GIB: The guy on the horse?!
HARRY: What the hell were you thinking? We had the guy and you let him get away. What kind of cop are you?
HARRY: What kind of cop are you?
HARRY: Look, I know you're upset. I'm really sorry, honey. I raced home as quick
HELEN: It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
HARRY: I'm sorry. Thank you for the Yeah. It was great. Let's go to bed, Harry. There's only one present you have to open

HELEN: Don't move. I'll be right back. Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
HARRY: Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
HELEN: I'll just be a second. So what happened tonight at the office?
HARRY: I couldn't believe it. I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it
HARRY: It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed. this guy's having a meltdown
HELEN: ( keeping him talking ) What'd you do, honey?
HARRY: Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680
HELEN: ( putting on black It sounds wild. So now you're a big hero, right? For fixing their system.
HARRY: ( faintly ) Uh huh.
HELEN: My husband the hero.
HELEN: I'll be right there, honey. Just a minute.
HELEN: Just a second.
HELEN: Happy Birthday, Harry.
GIB: Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet? Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch
HARRY: ( not listening ) Okay. Here she comes.
HARRY: Look at the way the little punk is driving. He's all over the place. Look he hasn't signalled once.
GIB: Goddammit! That's outrageous.
DANA: Oh my God! I think that's my Hang on!
TRENT: Hang on!
HARRY: ( clenching his jaw ) So, you wanna play huh? You ( rolling his eyes ) That's it. Get 'im Harry ( he draws a pistol ) We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
GIB: ( rolling his eyes ) That's it. Get 'im Harry ( he draws a pistol ) We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
GIB: ( exploding with Ha! The little prick ditched you! That is so goddamn funny.
HARRY: Son of a bitch!
GIB: Can we go to the office now, Mr.
HARRY: That's him.
HARRY: Abu Kaleem Malik.
GIB: ( reading from a file ) Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra- fundamentalist. Linked to numerous car-bombings, that cafe bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year. Major player.
FAISIL: Now he's formed his own splinter faction called CRIMSON JIHAD.
GIB: Guess he thought the other terrorist groups were too warm and fuzzy for his taste.
FAISIL: They call him "The Sand Spider".
TRILBY: ( he shrugs ) Probably because it sounds scary.
FAISIL: ( he shrugs ) Probably because it sounds scary.
TRILBY: This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
HARRY: We'll get him.
TRILBY: Yes. You will. Harry, I still want you in charge, even though your cover is blown. Just keep a low profile. I generally prefer it when my covert operations don't make the front page.
GIB: What's going on?
HARRY: Look, uh. I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
GIB: You want me to just hang ?
HARRY: Just hang a minute.
GIB: I'll just hang then, shall I?
RECEPTIONIST: Hello Mr. Tasker. Just a second, I'll buzz Helen.
HARRY: No. No, I'd like to surprise her. Thanks, I know where her desk is. It's your mystery man.

HELEN: Can you cover me for an hour?
ALLISON: Just an hour? You should tell this stud to take more time.
HELEN: Will you shutup. I should never have told you about him.
GIB: You look like you got gut-kicked. What's the matter? You sick?
HARRY: ( barely audible ) He Helen. Helen it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
GIB: Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
HARRY: She's having an affair.
GIB: Congratulations. Welcome to the It can't be. Not Helen.
HARRY: It can't be. Not Helen.
GIB: Nobody believes it can happen to It can't be.
HARRY: It can't be.
GIB: Same thing happened to me with wife two. I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty. I mean empty. She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge. What kind of person would think of that?
HARRY: ( not listening ) I still don't believe it.
GIB: Relax. Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her. It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a
HARRY: STOP. CHEERING. ME. UP.
GIB: What'dya expect Harry? She's a flesh and blood woman. And you're never there. It was only a matter of time.
GIB: I say we concentrate on work. That's how I always got through it whenever my life turned to dogshit. Let's catch some terrorists and then you can beat the crap out of them. You'll feel better.
GIB: Women. Can't live with 'em. Can't kill 'em.
GIB: He's giving us a blank check on wiretaps. So I've set 'em up on all of Juno's shipping agents, her clients, and Faisil made up a list of possible contacts that Crimson Jihad might have in this country. Now all we can do is
GIB: Is this national security stuff boring you?
HARRY: Put a tap on her phone.
GIB: What're you talking about? We have that.
HARRY: Helen's phone. Her office line and the line at my house.
GIB: ( a whispered hiss ) Okay . . .I have two words to describe that idea. In. Sane. Unauthorized wiretap is a felony, Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day. Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps. Now.
HARRY: Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day. Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps. Now.
GIB: Sure, Harry. I'm on it.
HARRY: How was school today?
DANA: Harry takes a bite of his food, watching her. Silence. Helen glances at him.
HELEN: So. You came by to see me today?
HARRY: I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
HELEN: They must've just missed me.
HARRY: They said you had to run out.

HELEN: I understand.
SIMON: It's my job to risk my life, but not yours. I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
HELEN: Where were you? On a. uh, Ssshhh! We say Op. Covert operation. And this one got a little rough.
SIMON: Ssshhh! We say Op. Covert operation. And this one got a little rough.
HELEN: Worse than Cairo?
SIMON: Cairo was a day at the beach next to this.
GIB: Guy's a spook!
HARRY: Yeah, but for who?

HELEN: That was you?!
SIMON: You recognized my style. See, you're very good. You're a natural at this.
GIB: The guy's a fake! He's taking credit for our moves.
HELEN: Tell me what happened?
SIMON: I'm sorry, I can't.
HELEN: You can trust me completely.
SIMON: I know. But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
HELEN: Right, of course. I was worried when I didn't hear from you that It's strange. I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those
SIMON: It's strange. I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those
GIB: 145 INT. CAFE - DAY
HELEN: Were they trying to kill you?
SIMON: Three of them. Hardly worth talking about. Two won't bother me again.
HELEN: And you chased one?
SIMON: Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the risk. It was pretty hairy. I thought he had me, a couple of times. But I really can't take credit . . .
HELEN: You can't?
SIMON: No. It's the training. It shapes you into a lethal instrument. You react without
GIB: I'm starting to like this guy.
GIB: ( holding up his hand We still have to kill him, that's a given.
HELEN: What is it you want me to do?
SIMON: Not here. I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again. We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together. For your safety.
HELEN: You'll call me then?
SIMON: Yes. Now go.
GIB: ( laughing ) He's a goddamn used car salesman. This just gets better. ( catching himself ) Sorry Harry, I know this is
SIMON: It's a great little bar, Amanda, you'd love it. Beirut's a great place if you know the city. Listen, this isn't a secure line. I'll tell you all about it when I get back tomorrow. if I live. Scared? Never! Except of you
SIMON: I have to go, baby. A guy's coming toward me Simon, look out there. You see that man? Notice how he's looking at the cars. He's called a customer. I know it's been a while, but do you remember what you're supposed to do when we have a customer?
DOUG: Simon, look out there. You see that man? Notice how he's looking at the cars. He's called a customer. I know it's been a while, but do you remember what you're supposed to do when we have a customer?
SIMON: It wants you too. Feel it vibrate? How about a little
SIMON: You gotta jump in. That's rule number one. It takes a little practice, but there's no way around it.
SIMON: See, it's not just the car, it's a total image. An identity you have to go for. This isn't some high-tech sports car. it doesn't even handle that great. But that's not the idea, is it.
SIMON: What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
HARRY: Simon laughs. Harry laughs. A big lusty, male-bonding kind of How do you grin warmly while your eyes are so cold? Ask Harry.
SIMON: Well then this is a vital piece of equipment. Used properly, it can change your life. See, you cruise. No racing. This ain't a Ferrari. You check out the scenery, let the scenery check you out. You got to take it slow. Old cars are like good women. they heat up fast.
HARRY: Keep talking.
SIMON: Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet. But it's not enough. If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an And you've got one.
HARRY: And you've got one.
SIMON: It's killer. Look at me I'm not that much to look at. No really. I can be honest. But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either. Some are.
HARRY: So what's your angle?
SIMON: Sorry. Trade secret.
HARRY: ( grinning ) Sure. Set me up and then don't tell me.
SIMON: Okay, just ask yourself. What do women really want? You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years. Stuck in a rut. They need some release. The promise of adventure. A hint of danger. I create that for them.
HARRY: So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time? I couldn't do it.
SIMON: Well, think of it as playing a role. It's fantasy. You have to work on their dreams. Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
HARRY: Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
SIMON: Doesn't matter. I like change. You know, constant turnover. As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then Use 'em and lose 'em.
HARRY: Use 'em and lose 'em.
SIMON: Exactly. The trick is, you gotta pick your target. They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers. But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
HARRY: What about the husbands?
SIMON: Dickless. If they took care of business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
HARRY: Those idiots.
HARRY: You working on someone right now?
SIMON: I always have a couple on the hook. You know. There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog. It's great.
HARRY: What does she do?
SIMON: Some kinda legal secretary of something. Married to some boring jerk.
SIMON: And she could be so hot, if she wanted to be. She's like a dying plant that just needs a little
HARRY: But with you, she gets to be hot, Red hot. Her thighs steam.
SIMON: Red hot. Her thighs steam.
HARRY: Sooooo. she's pretty good in bed, then?
SIMON: ( yelling suddenly ) Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
SIMON: See. You and this car were meant for each other. Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style. Whattya say? Should we start on the paperwork?
HARRY: Let me think about it. Hold it a day for me?
SIMON: Because it's you.
HELEN: Dinner's in the warmer. Tell your father I may be late.
DANA: Where are you going?
HELEN: Dana is momentarily puzzled by the reversal of roles.
GIB: Here's today's transcripts. There's nothing interesting.
SIMON: Nothing from Simon?
HARRY: Give me the page.
GIB: What are you talking about?
HARRY: It skips from page nine to eleven. Where's page ten?
GIB: Aw, it's gotta be a typo
HARRY: GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
GIB: ( shrugging ) Okay. Here.
GIB: Jeez, Harry. Seek help.
SIMON: Helen. I need your help. Can you meet me tonight?
HELEN: What's happened?
SIMON: It's serious. That's all I can say. Just meet on K Street under the Key Bridge. At eight sharp.
HARRY: Shit! It's almost eight.
HARRY: She's still at my house.
GIB: The purse is still at the house.
HARRY: Unit Two? Unit Seven?
FAISIL: Seven here.
UNIT TWO: This is Two.
HARRY: Immediate roll. Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge. Vehicle is red-and-white convertible. You have six Roger, One. Rolling.
FAISIL: Roger, One. Rolling.
UNIT TWO: Copy that.
GIB: Wait a minute! Are you out of your mind? You can't pull agents off a priority surveillance to follow your wife! It's gross misappropriation of Sector's resources, it's. it's a breach of national security. You copy, Harry? This is too far. You're losing it big-time. I have to stop you.
GIB: You copy, Harry? This is too far. You're losing it big-time. I have to stop you.
HARRY: Whatya going to do? Tell?
GIB: Goddamnit, Harry. This is our butts. So your life is in the toilet. So your wife is banging a used car salesman. Sure it's humiliating. But be a man here
HARRY: You tell on me, I tell on you.
GIB: Whatya talking? I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe. Clean as a
HARRY: What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
GIB: ( instantly contrite ) You know about that?
GIB: Take Franklin, it's quicker.
GIB: You don't have any pictures though, do ya. Huh?
MORTON: Two here. Subject is southbound on Key Bridge. A man and a woman in the vehicle.
SIMON: Now don't be alarmed. but if I'm spotter, it would be best if they don't see you. You should keep your head down until we're out of the city.
HARRY: Roger, two. One to Condor, do you have visual?
SIMON: My place in the city is too hot right now. So is the penthouse in New York. But this place is secure.
SIMON: To our assignment.
HELEN: What is it you need me to do?
SIMON: Helen, I want you to be my wife.
HELEN: I'm married!
SIMON: ( quickly ) Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married. They'll be looking for a man traveling We're going to Paris?
HELEN: We're going to Paris?
SIMON: Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit. I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you. Can you get away? Just for two days.
HELEN: I don't know. I have to think.
SIMON: Here. Sit down. Be comfortable.
HELEN: Okay. I'll do it.
SIMON: You are incredibly brave. I have to remind myself the fear you must be feeling. I've lived like this for years, so I'm used to it. Every day when I get up, I think it might be my last. But it makes you appreciate life. And the moment. Because that may be all you have.
SIMON: To pull this cover story off, we have to look exactly like two people who are intimate with each other. The enemy can spot a fake
SIMON: You see what I mean? That reaction would give us away in a second. Try to relax.
HELEN: It's just that. it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I
SIMON: Relax. There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
SIMON: There you go. That's right. NO! Stop! Get off me RIGHT NOW! If not for me, do it for
HELEN: NO! Stop! Get off me RIGHT NOW! If not for me, do it for
SIMON: If not for me, do it for
HARRY: Sit down.
HELEN: Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
HELEN: He said he was an American agent.
HARRY: How long have you been a member of his faction?
HELEN: I don't know anything about a faction. I just met Simon. or whatever his name is. a couple of weeks ago. I barely know him.
GIB: That's not what it looked like when we found you.
HARRY: How did you meet him?
SIMON: ( speaking very low ) Keep this for me. I can't afford to be taken with it. National security is at stake. I'll contact you if a can. Okay? Oh
HELEN: I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
GIB: But you didn't. Why not?
HELEN: I don't know. I guess. I wanted to see what would happen.
HARRY: What did happen?
HELEN: Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
SIMON: Thank you. You saved my life. What's your name?
HELEN: You can call me Simon. You're very brave to do this. You opened it.
SIMON: You can call me Simon. You're very brave to do this. You opened it.
HELEN: I just glances inside.
SIMON: ( solemn ) Then you know.
HARRY: Why did you continue to see him?
HELEN: He needed my help.
HARRY: Not because you were attracted to You weren't attracted to him at Well, maybe a little.
HELEN: You weren't attracted to him at Well, maybe a little.
HARRY: You weren't attracted to him at Well, maybe a little.
HELEN: Well, maybe a little.
GIB: Is this a common thing for you? No! Never!
HELEN: No! Never!
GIB: So, it was your first time.
HELEN: I wasn't cheating!
HARRY: Tell me about your husband, Mrs Harry? What can I say about Harry? He's a sales rep for a computer company.
HELEN: Harry? What can I say about Harry? He's a sales rep for a computer company.
HARRY: ( hard question for him ) Would you say he was boring, ( she sighs, nodding Yeah. I suppose he is.
HELEN: ( she sighs, nodding Yeah. I suppose he is.
GIB: So sex with him isn't exactly making your flag wave anymore.
HELEN: That's none of your goddamn business! What kind of questions are these?
HARRY: You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate. If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
HELEN: My husband is a good man.
GIB: But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right? I mean
HARRY: Let me handle this part. Do you Why did you go to Carlos' He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
HELEN: He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
HARRY: And you agreed?
HELEN: ( amazed )
HARRY: ( amazed )
HELEN: I don't know. I guess I needed What did you need?
HARRY: What did you need?
HELEN: I needed to feel alive. I wanted to do something. outrageous. And. I don't know. it felt good to be needed. To be trusted. To be special.
HELEN: There's so much I wanted to do in this life, and it's like I haven't done any of it. And the sand's running out of the hourglass. I want to be able to look back and say: See! I did that. It was wild and it was reckless and outrageous and I fucking did it! And I frankly don't give a shit if you understand this or not.
HARRY: This Simon. Did you sleep with She's lying.
HELEN: ( covering the mike ) She's lying.
GIB: ( covering the mike ) She's lying.
HARRY: You didn't have sexual relations with him?
HELEN: ( acidly ) Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time. And I have to get home to my family.

HELEN: Let me out of her! Right now!
HARRY: Answer the question
HELEN: ( she swings again, I didn't sleep with him! ( and againWHAM! ) You hear me, you chickenshit
GIB: She could be telling the truth.
HARRY: ( to Helen ) Wait! Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
HELEN: Do you still love your husband?
HARRY: Do you still love your husband?
HELEN: ( softly ) Louder please.
HARRY: Louder please.

If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life. If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.

HARRY: ( like: isn't it I'm giving her an assignment. ( to Helen ) I am offerring you a choice. If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life. If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone. Your like will be destroyed.

HARRY: You will be contacted with the My husband can't know about this.
HELEN: My husband can't know about this.

HELEN: I think so.
HARRY: Think carefully. You will be lying to the man you love. The person who trusts you the most.
HELEN: ( fearless ) I can do it!
HARRY: The code name of your contact will be Boris. Your code name will be

HARRY: You son of a bitch. Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
SIMON: Wait! You got the wrong guy. My name's Simon. Look, just let me go. There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your
SIMON: face. Shit! Shit!!
SIMON: It's you! Hey, you still interested in that Vette at all?
GIB: You can drop it now, Carlos. The game is over. Your career as an inter-national terrorist is too well documented.
SIMON: No. I sell cars. That's all! Not even foreign cars. Nothing international, I swear. I'm no terrorist. Everything I said was a lie. you have to believe me. I'm actually a complete coward. If I ever even saw a gun I'd
SIMON: faint. Aahhh! Don't kill me. I'm not a spy. I'm nothing. I'm navel lint. I have to lie to women to get laid. And I don't score much. It's pathetic. See, look. would a spy pee
HARRY: Beat it.
SIMON: No. Soon as I turn you'll shoot

DANA: Yeah, right.
HARRY: You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
DANA: Why? So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
HARRY: Did I tell you about the time we first met?
HARRY: You were quite young at the time. All wet and still attached to your mom by a cord. You opened your eyes and looked right at me. And I knew then I would always love you with all my heart.
HARRY: Somewhere along the way I got lost, honey. I forgot about what was really important. I'm sorry pump I mean
HARRY: Dana, regarding this singing
HARRY: ( grinning ) You were pretty good.
DANA: Dad, how come you know the words?
HARRY: Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
DANA: Unbelievable! Trent told me he wrote it. He's history.
DANA: I'm done.
HELEN: Where are you off to young lady?
DANA: ( pointing toward her I have a book report.
HARRY: So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
HELEN: ( alarmed ) ( then smoothly ) Oh, the flat tire? Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
HELEN: METALLIC VOICE
METALLIC VOICE: Oh. Yes?

HELEN: Get going!
VOICE: Get going!
HELEN: ( thinking for a second, Uh. well, okay then. You sound terrible. I'll run out right now. Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy. Sure, no problem. Bye.
HELEN: Allison is sick in bed. I have to go over there, honey.
HARRY: Sure, hon.
GIB: You've reached a new low with this one. I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
HARRY: Why not? You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?
GIB: Not quite.
HELEN: Do you have an envelope for

VOICE: No. He has particular tastes. He likes to watch. You will say his regular girl, Carla, is sick. If he likes you, he will tell you what to do. You must plant the bug near the telephone, by the bed, before you leave. If you do not accomplish your mission, the deal is off.
VOICE: In here.
MAN: Step into the light.
HELEN: I'm Michelle. Carla's sick. She thought you might like me, so Let me do the talking. You are very pretty. You may start by unzipping your dress.
HELEN: ( puzzled ) I'm not wearing any.
HELEN: I thought you only liked to
HELEN: Harry ?!
HELEN: He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
HARRY: ( to lead TERRORIST ) Let the hooker go. She's not Harry, be quiet. Let me handle Shutup, both of you.
HELEN: Harry, be quiet. Let me handle Shutup, both of you.
LEAD TERRORIST: Shutup, both of you.

HELEN: That was unnecessary.
HELEN: What were you doing there?
HARRY: You wouldn't believe me.
TERRORIST LEADER: Talk again, I kill you.
JUNO: ( with a wry smile ) Hello, Harry.
HARRY: Juno. I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
HELEN: You know her?
JUNO: Who's your little friend?
HELEN: I'm Helen Tasker. Harry's my husband. And you are?
JUNO: ( to Harry ) So now it's Tasker? Not
HELEN: Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
JUNO: No, my dear, he is a federal agent. He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
HELEN: No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years
HARRY: Look, Juno, this is just some whacko hooker I met in the bar.

MALIK: Who is this woman?
JUNO: His wife.
MALIK: ( seeing the His wife? Good. Bring them.
JUNO: Incredible, aren't they? Warrior figures from the Persian Empire of Darius the First, around 500 BC. I call them "The Four
JUNO: They're absolutely priceless.
MALIK: Open it.
MALIK: Do you know what this is?
HARRY: Can you give me a clue? It could be a water heater for all I know.
MALIK: Do you know why you have been brought here?
HELEN: So that this man can verify to the world that Crimson Jihad is now a nuclear power.
MALIK: So that this man can verify to the world that Crimson Jihad is now a nuclear power.
HELEN: How can Harry do that? He's a salesman for chrissakes.
MALIK: If we were wrong about him. then the last thing you see will be your blood spraying in his
HARRY: This is a Soviet MIRV-Six, from an SS-22N launch vehicle. The warhead contains 14.5 kilos of enriched uranium, with a plutonium trigger. The nominal yield is 10 kilotons. Release her and I'll cooperate.
HARRY: What can I say? I'm a spy. You bastard!! You lying son of a bitch!!
HELEN: You bastard!! You lying son of a bitch!!
HARRY: I'm sorry, honey.
HELEN: Don't call me honey! You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?! You pig!
JUNO: Here you go, dear.
AKBAR: Abu! Look at this!
HELEN: You bugged me?!!
FAISIL: We've lost the signal.
GIB: Son of a bitch! Where?
FAISIL: It's an island in the Keys, out past Marathon.
PILOT: Miami TCA, we are on final.
GIB: Call our DEA contact, tell him I want those choppers flight-ready the second we land.
HARRY: .and I can verify that they have the arming box and all equipment necessary to detonate the four warheads. This is absolutely the real thing,
MALIK: You have killed our women and children, bombed our cities from afar like cowards, and dare to call us terrorists
MALIK: But now the Oppressed have been given a mighty sword, to strike back at their enemies. Unless the US pulls all military forces out of the Persian Gulf area, immediately and forever, Crimson Jihad will rain fire on one major US city each week until these demands are met.
MALIK: . First one weapon will be detonated on this uninhabited island as a demonstration of Crimson Jihad's power and our willingness to be humanitarian. However, if there demands are not
CAMERAMAN: Battery, Abu.
MALIK: Get another one, you moron!
JUNO: This is Samir. See if you can guess his specialty.
HARRY: Oral hygiene?
JUNO: Not exactly.
HELEN: ( scared ) What's going on, Harry?
JUNO: Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions. See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for. Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years. So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
SAMIR: ( holding up a syringe ) This will help.
HARRY: You know, you should swab that with alcohol. I might get an I'll return when this has taken effect. Then we'll talk.
SAMIR: I'll return when this has taken effect. Then we'll talk.
HARRY: I'm looking forward to it.
HARRY: Why are you helping these raving Because they're very well-funded raving psychotics, and I'm getting a lot of money.
JUNO: Because they're very well-funded raving psychotics, and I'm getting a lot of money.
JUNO: You think I care about their cause? Or yours? Not at all. See, America is on top now . . . but so was Rome, once. All civilizations crumble. One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run? The only important thing is to live well. And. living well takes money.
HARRY: You're damaged goods, lady.
JUNO: ( indicating Helen ) Did you tell her about us, Harry?
HARRY: There is no us, you psychotic Sure. Say that now.
JUNO: Sure. Say that now.
JUNO: Thanks for everything, Harry. It was good while it lasted.
JUNO: Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
HELEN: Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
JUNO: Hold that thought.
HARRY: There was nothing. I swear.
HELEN: What did he give you?
HARRY: ( groggy ) Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
HELEN: It makes you tell the truth?
HARRY: Is it working yet?
HELEN: Is it working yet?
HARRY: Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
HELEN: Are we going to die?
HARRY: I'd say it's working.
HELEN: I'd say it's working.
HARRY: They'll either torture us to death, shoot us in the head, or leave us until the bomb goes off.
HELEN: Okay, okay. I get it. How long have you been a spy, Harry?
HARRY: 17 years.
HELEN: My God. Have you had to. have sex with other women in the line of duty?
HARRY: I don't take those assignments.
HELEN: What about Juno?
HARRY: She's really a fox, isn't she?
HELEN: Did you pork her Harry?
HARRY: ( pause ) But I wanted to.
HELEN: ( crying ) Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
HARRY: Looks that way.
SAMIR: Is there anything you would like to tell me before we start?
HARRY: Yes. I'm going to kill you pretty soon.
SAMIR: ( calmly preparing his I see. How exactly?
SAMIR: Well, I thought I'd break your neck, then use you as a human shield, then kill the guard with that knife there on your table and take his gun.
SAMIR: ( humoring Harry ) And what makes you think you can do all that?
HARRY: Because I picked the lock on these handcuffs.
HARRY: Don't move.
HELEN: What is it?
HARRY: ( staring transfixed ) God, you have great legs.
HELEN: Harry. snap out of it!
HARRY: Go it, baby.
HELEN: Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
HARRY: Do you still love me?
HELEN: Do you still love me?
HARRY: As much as you used to?
HELEN: As much as you used to?
HARRY: ( she deflates ) Much more.
HELEN: ( grinning ) It wore off. They found the bodies. Come on
HARRY: They found the bodies. Come on
HELEN: I married Rambo.
HARRY: Let's go.
HARRY: In ninety minutes a pillar of holy fire will rise at this place as a sign to out enemies. It is done. Now no man can stop us. We are set on our course. No force can stop us. . we're cool, we're badass, blah blah.
HARRY: Now no man can stop us. We are set on our course. No force can stop us. . we're cool, we're badass, blah blah.
HELEN: If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
HARRY: We must be in the Florida Keys . . . the Overseas Highway connects the islands to the So there's no border, no customs. They can just drive anywhere they want . . . there's nothing to stop them . . .
HELEN: So there's no border, no customs. They can just drive anywhere they want . . . there's nothing to stop them . . .
