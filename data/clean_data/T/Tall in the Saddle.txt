BOB CLEWS: Maybe he wants to thank you for teaching that pup of his a lesson.
ROCKLIN: ( after a second ) I'll be down.
MED. SHOT: group at window as Dave pushes them aside to get a view of what is happening outside.
DAVE: What's goin' on here?
PAP FOSSLER: Arly Harolday's on the warpath.

ARLY: ( imperiously ) Is your name Rocklin?
ROCKLIN: ( coldly ) ( contemptuously ) I want that money you took from my brother last night.
ARLY: ( contemptuously ) I want that money you took from my brother last night.
ROCKLIN: ( quietly ) Are you crazy? Or just ignorant?
ARLY: ( flaming ) You took it at the point of a gun ( suddenly whipping a revolver from her saddle holster ) and I'm taking it back the same

CLINT: What happened?
ARLY: You lied to me, didn't you?
CLINT: Don't think I'll forget this. Making a fool of me in front of the whole
ARLY: Don't think I'll forget this. Making a fool of me in front of the whole
DAVE: Boy, oh boy, was that a near thing! She'd just as soon have hit you as missed. You don't know how lucky you were, son.
ROCKLIN: Don't I? Why d'you think I need this?
BOB CLEWS: Funniest sight I ever seen.
BOB CLEWS: ( moaning ) You broke it! You broke it!
ROCKLIN: Try another trick like that on me and it'll be worse.
BOB CLEWS: I never played you no trick. You broke my wrist.
WIDER ANGLE: to include the bystanders. They look at Bob Clews without sympathy. He gets to his feet and stumbles back, collapsing in a chair.
CLOSE SHOT: at bar, Dave has taken the bottle from Cap and is refilling Rocklin's and his own glass ecstatically.
DAVE: ( gurgling with delight ) Oh boy has somebody come to town!
ROCKLIN: ( to Cap ) Where'll I find Judge Garvey?
CAP: He rooms behind his office down the street. Don't usually pull up the blinds till around noon, though.
ROCKLIN: ( putting down money ) He will this morning. ( to Dave ) See you later, old-timer.
DISSOLVE: EXT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY Clint Harolday is seen at the window peering furtively toward the Sun-Up Saloon. He suddenly notices something o.s. which prompts him to say something which we of course cannot hear. Now Garvey appears at the window.
GARVEY: ( effusively ) Oh, come in, Mr. Rocklin. Come right
ROCKLIN: I understand you were Red Caldwell's I was.
GARVEY: ( immediately on guard ) I was.
ROCKLIN: Know anything about this?
MED. SHOT: Rocklin and Garvey. The latter looks up from the letter completely bewildered.
GARVEY: I don't understand. Job? What job?
ROCKLIN: ( gaping ) On the "K.C."? ( trying to take it in ) But but why should he want you?
GARVEY: ( gaping ) On the "K.C."? ( trying to take it in ) But but why should he want you?
ROCKLIN: Why not? Good foremen don't grow on
GARVEY: ( thinking hard ) Is that your only motive for coming What other motive could I have?
ROCKLIN: What other motive could I have?
GARVEY: I don't know It's just that Red Caldwell was a peculiar man had a funny way of doing things.
GARVEY: Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Rocklin, that you've been brought all this way on a fool's errand, but I'm afraid the deal's off.
ROCKLIN: I don't want to be too hard on you, but as executor of the estate I have to consider the interests of the new owner. How about, say, a hundred in full settlement?
GARVEY: I don't want to be too hard on you, but as executor of the estate I have to consider the interests of the new owner. How about, say, a hundred in full settlement?
ROCKLIN: ( thoughtfully )
GARVEY: That's my last word think it over. How do you do, ladies
GARVEY: ( graciously ) How do you do, ladies
MISS MARTIN: ( icily ) You are Judge Garvey, I presume.
GARVEY: ( nods ) Yes and you are
MISS MARTIN: Miss Martin and my niece, Clara Of course of course
GARVEY: ( reaching for a chair ) Of course of course
GARVEY: You came at a very opportune moment, madam. This gentleman claims to have some sort of a letter from the late Mr. Caldwell, engaging him as foreman of the "K.C."
MISS MARTIN: ( to Garvey ) What do you mean claims to have? You saw it, didn't you?
ROCKLIN: ( to Garvey ) What do you mean claims to have? You saw it, didn't you?
MISS MARTIN: ( before Garvey can answer ) You can't hold us to account for every promise made by that man. Everyone knows he wasn't responsible for his actions half the time. And if you think I'd have you as a foreman
ROCKLIN: ( finds it hard to control himself ) Listen, lady I'd rather walk for somebody else, than ride for you.
MISS MARTIN: ( taken aback ) Well the impudence
ROCKLIN: All I come for this morning was to pay beck the hundred and fifty Red Caldwell sent in advance.
CLARA: Oh, no
MISS MARTIN: Don't interfere, Clara. Of course he must pay it back.
ROCKLIN: The railway fare well, I reckon we can check that up against the time lost and call it quits.
CLARA: ( summoning up her courage ) But, Mr. er I don't know your ( raising his hat ) Rocklin, miss.
ROCKLIN: ( raising his hat ) Rocklin, miss.
CLARA: Mr. Rocklin, it isn't fair for you to pay anything back.
ROCKLIN: That's how I'd prefer it, If you don't mind, miss never did care fer owing favors to no one especially women.
CLARA: ( as if she had been struck )
MED. SHOT: on door, as it opens to admit Arly. Ignoring everyone in the room except Garvey, she comes abruptly to the desk, with the riding quirt dangling from her wrist.
ARLY: I've just heard they let George Clews out of penitentiary and that he's headed this way. You might tell him from me, if he sets foot on the Santee Ranch, I'll shoot him on sight.
GARVEY: But really, Miss Arly, why should you deliver your message through me?
ARLY: You have mutual friends.
GARVEY: If you're referring to Sheriff I am.
ARLY: I am.
GARVEY: But that's absurd. The fact that he employs one of the Clews brothers doesn't make the other his friend.
ARLY: ( contemptuously ) Have it your own way; but it'd be fair to warn him, because I mean it.
GARVEY: ( hastening to change the conversation ) Oh, Miss Caldwell, this is Miss Harolday Miss Martin, Miss Caldwell's aunt. You should know one another, seeing you'll be neighbors. Miss Harolday runs the Santee Ranch for her stepfather. She's a famous ah horsewoman in these parts.
CLARA: ( with ingenuous enthusiasm ) I know. I saw you ride into town this morning. You looked lovely. Just what I'd like to be.
ARLY: ( slowly, a bit flustered ) ( completely innocent ) Oh, this is Mr. Rocklin. He drove us in from Garden City last night. He.
CLARA: ( completely innocent ) Oh, this is Mr. Rocklin. He drove us in from Garden City last night. He.
ROCKLIN: ( dead pan ) I already met Miss Harolday.
CLARA: ( stonily, to Rocklin ) I've a message for you from ( murmuring ) What, again?
ARLY: ( stonily, to Rocklin ) I've a message for you from ( murmuring ) What, again?
ROCKLIN: ( murmuring ) What, again?
ARLY: He wants you to come down to the What for?
ROCKLIN: What for?
ARLY: He's got a proposition to make about riding for him. Sixty a month.
ROCKLIN: Hmmm That's a foreman's wages.
ARLY: ( suddenly exploding ) I wouldn't offer you a red cent. ( controlling herself ) But it's his money. ( bitingly ) And the way things are shaping, maybe we could do with somebody as mean as you around the ranch.
MISS MARTIN: ( pushing her way forward ) I warn you, you're making a great mistake. This man is no good.
CLARA: ( to Rocklin ignoring Miss Martin ) Well? D'you want the job?
ARLY: ( to Rocklin ignoring Miss Martin ) Well? D'you want the job?
CLOSE SHOT: Rocklin, as he stares at Arly with an enigmatic expression. Suddenly, he seems to make up his mind.
ROCKLIN: ( indicating the door ) Lead the way.
MED. SHOT: as Arly turns abruptly on her heel and exits the way she came. Rocklin makes a little gesture to the ladies with his hat and follows. As he goes, Juan, who has been leaning against the doorpost, follows, closing the door behind him.
CLARA: ( after they have gone ) Auntie, why did you have to say that? I simply don't understand you.
MISS MARTIN: ( cutting in, grimly ) But I understand you. ( scathingly ) I'd be ashamed of myself. Throwing myself at a man like that.
CLARA: I. I. Oh, you're horrid horrid. I wish I'd never come. You must excuse her. She's young.
MISS MARTIN: You must excuse her. She's young.
GARVEY: And inexperienced.
MISS MARTIN: ( significantly ) And young people must be protected from themselves at times don't you agree? ( at last, with a grim echo of a smile )
GARVEY: ( at last, with a grim echo of a smile )
ROCKLIN: ( to Arly, indicating Julio ) Does he always follow you?
ARLY: ( defiantly ) He's not following me he's with me he's always with me.
ROCKLIN: ( takes it mildly ) Oh just an old Indian friend.
ARLY: ( straight at him ) The best friend I've got.
ARLY: ( abruptly to Rocklin ) Wait here.
ARLY: I've just hired a man named Rocklin and said you made me do it. Sixty dollars and he 'll earn it while he lasts. Why did you do it, Arly?
HAROLDAY: ( quietly ) Why did you do it, Arly?
ARLY: So I can fire him. I hate him. Clint and he quarrelled last night. Clint lied about it and I made a fool of He's outside now.
HAROLDAY: ( with a little sigh ) All right. Send him in.
ARLY: ( calling ) Come in.
REVERSE SHOT: as Rocklin comes from the doorway into f.g. of shot, facing Harolday, who is seated on the far side of the desk.
HAROLDAY: Mr. Rocklin, what happened between you and my son last night?
ROCKLIN: Hmmm. About this suggestion of you working for me.
HAROLDAY: Hmmm. About this suggestion of you working for me.
ROCKLIN: It's your suggestion, not mine.
HAROLDAY: Ye-es. Sixty dollars is big money.
ROCKLIN: ( turning to go ) If you've changed your mind.
HAROLDAY: No, no.. Wait a minute. I take it you've had the experience.
ROCKLIN: Enough for Red Caldwell to hire me as foreman.
HAROLDAY: Oh had Caldwell hired you?
ROCKLIN: Yeah but I won't ride for the new owners so that leaves me open.
HAROLDAY: I see Were you a friend of Red's?
ROCKLIN: No I guess he just heard about
MED. SHOT: as Dave, followed by Arly and Juan, bursts in. His eyes go around the room quickly until he finds Rocklin.
DAVE: ( as excited as a schoolboy ) George Clews is in town. He's seen what you done to Bob and he's a- lookin' for you.
HAROLDAY: The street is clear. Tell him I'll be out in the street in front of the saloon.
ROCKLIN: ( to Dave irritably ) Tell him I'll be out in the street in front of the saloon.
DAVE: ( dashing out, radiant )
GEORGE CLEWS: I'm gonna get his ears.
DAVE: ( loudly ) Hi you, George Clews
DAVE: Rocklin says if you don't come out, he'll come in here after you, an' tear you apart.
SHORTY: ( taps Clews ) That was my beer, you know.
GEORGE CLEWS: ( nastily ) If he comes in again I'll throw
CAP: ( to the Clews ) That does it, boys you know where the door is.
GEORGE CLEWS: ( to Bob ) Com-mon I'll get his ears.
CAP: Not until I get my money
CAP: There's three drinks and a broken beer glass.
GEORGE CLEWS: ( to Bob, after a second's deliberation ) Pay 'im.
GEORGE CLEWS: I'll get his ears.
PAP: ( quietly ) That Rocklin'll kill him for sure.
CUSTOMER: Le's hope.
LONG SHOT: Rocklin FROM George's ANGLE. He is walking slowly forward down the middle of the street.
MED. SHOT: George, looking baffled by the steady approach.
GEORGE CLEWS: ( yelling ) I'm coming and you'd better run!
CLOSE SHOT: Rocklin CAMERA MOVING WITH him as he comes slowly and steadily forward.
CLOSE SHOT: George. His hands are on his guns, but drunk or not, he has too much sense to draw too soon.
FULL SHOT: Rocklin SHOOTING PAST George, whose hands are on his gun butts. Rocklin's thumbs are hooked in his belt as he continues slowly forward, his eyes fixed on George's.
ROCKLIN: ( quietly ) Draw a gun and I'll kill you.
MED. SHOT: George, as he stands bewildered and open- mouthed. Rocklin enters scene, suddenly whips out his gun and brings it crashing down alongside George's head. The barrel strikes though the crown of his hat and he goes down like a pole- axed steer.
JACKSON: ( to Rocklin ) Hey, you! What's this you been up I just laid a gun barrel over the head of a drunk friend of yours same as you did over Dave's here ( surprised ) ( blustering ) I don't know what you're talking ( calmly ) You're a liar! Now you lookee here, young feller. You go on talking that way and you'll find yourself in trouble.
ROCKLIN: I just laid a gun barrel over the head of a drunk friend of yours same as you did over Dave's here I don't know what you're talking You're a liar! Now you lookee here, young feller. You go on talking that way and you'll find yourself in trouble.

MISS MARTIN: ( ignoring everyone but Rocklin ) I saw you. I saw you strike that poor man.
ROCKLIN: Yes, ma'am. As hard as I could.
MISS MARTIN: You ruffian, you!
MISS MARTIN: Let me go! I knew the sort you were the moment I set eyes on you. You can't fool me! You're nothing but a common adventurer! Come, Clara!
ROCKLIN: Now what was that you were sayin' about Caldwell?
HAROLDAY: You being hired by Red Caldwell only confirms what I'd suspected he was getting ready to fight.
ROCKLIN: ( trying to get information ) Fight? Who?
HAROLDAY: Organized rustling. Well at least that's my belief. Red was no friend of mine. Too fond of taking the law into his own hands. But he had my sympathy. He'd been harder hit than any of us. And on top of it all, he lost his foreman.
ROCKLIN: You mean, he quit on him?
HAROLDAY: He was shot in the back with a bullet from the same caliber rifle as got Red.
ROCKLIN: Got any ideas?
HAROLDAY: No Except that the man you just pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere. Pity you didn't kill him when you had the chance.
ROCKLIN: Say it don't sound as if it's goin' to be too easy for them wimmen at the K.C.
HAROLDAY: ( watching him keenly ) Want to go back and work for them?
ROCKLIN: No, sir. And I ain't jumping at this offer o' yours either because I don't hold with working for wimmen.
HAROLDAY: ( quickly ) Oh, you mean my step-daughter. Well don't worry. She won't interfere with you.Rocklin I figure we've been losin' cattle over a place called Table Top it's the back way into the Topaz Ranch and the perfect route for rustlers I'm going to send you up to the line camp you don't mind working a lone hand do you?

DISSOLVE IN: EXT. TOPAZ RANCH HOUSE - DAY Shelley, a Negro servant of the Harolday household, is discovered sweeping the front porch. Behind him we see Clint open the door peer furtively out then cross the porch to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for Shelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with his sweeping. His only reaction is a disparaging glance over his shoulder.
CLINT: ( turning to Shelley ) Have you seen Arly?
SHELLEY: No, suh, Ah didn't see Miss Arly today, but Ah seed her las' night, and she shore was mad. Plenty mad!
SHELLEY: Plenty mad!
ANGLE: From their ANGLE we first see only the corner of the house, while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side. Now Arly comes into view, entirely oblivious of Clint and Shelley watching her. She seems more attractive, in a feminine way, this morning. It may be the skirt and blouse she is wearing. Then again it may be the flower she is, even now, adjusting in her hair. The presence of the two men suddenly startles her. The song ends abruptly, while her hands fall quickly away from the flower.
ARLY: As Arly moves toward the porch, Shelley snaps back to life and resumes sweeping but furiously. Clint regards the girl in the vague manner of the puzzled gent he is.
CLINT: ( not too definitely ) 'Mornin', Arly

ARLY: What's the matter?
TALA: ( easily ) Rocklin is not here.
ARLY: ( breathlessly ) He quit?
TALA: He has gone to the line camp at Table It was Mr. Harolday's orders.
ARLY: It was Mr. Harolday's orders.
TALA: It was Mr. Harolday's orders.
TALA: ( in a fatherly manner ) Why do you make your heart heavy with thoughts of him, little one. He is not for you.
ARLY: ( bitterly ) Be quiet.
TALA: He has made the choice, Arliete. With your own eyes you saw it And she, too, has opened her heart to him Already she has summoned him to her.

ARLY: Who'd ever try driving cattle over Table-Top? Unless they were crazy.
HAROLDAY: ( coldly ) I don't agree with you. In any case if you must have it I'd no intention of engaging a man at foreman's wages just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman!
ARLY: ( dangerously ) You take care what you're saying.

FADE IN: INT. CABIN - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT on a soiled and wrinkled envelope lying on a table. It is addressed to: The CAMERA PULLS BACK and Rocklin is revealed at the table, looking down at the letter. His hat is tipped back on his head, and his sleeves are rolled up. He is mixing dough in a bowl sitting on the table near the letter, and his hands are all gooey. Dave is discovered in front of the fireplace where his outer shirt and socks are drying. It is dark outside, but the storm has abated. Rocklin goes to a shelf near the fireplace to get a pan.
DAVE: ( during the above ) Durn funny that storm quittin' just about the time I get here.
ROCKLIN: No funnier than you sloggin' through it, just to deliver a letter from a Reckon I'm gettin' to be more of a fool the older I get.
DAVE: ( disgustedly ) Reckon I'm gettin' to be more of a fool the older I get.
DAVE: When are we gonna get around to readin' it?
ROCKLIN: Thought I'd wait till mornin' might be bad news an' I wouldn't be able to sleep.
DAVE: Mmmm dineroo. Forgive me if this letter is a trifle incoherent, but I am terribly worried and unhappy.
ROCKLIN'S VOICE: ( reading ) Forgive me if this letter is a trifle incoherent, but I am terribly worried and unhappy.
DAVE: Who wouldn't be livin' with that ole screech owl.
ROCKLIN: ( continues to read ) I am desperately in need of help and advice from someone whom I feel I can trust, and I am appealing to you, because I regard you in the same way my Uncle surely must have. I heartily dislike and distrust Judge ( interrupting ) Huh Smart girl
DAVE: ( interrupting ) Huh Smart girl
ROCKLIN: ( going on ) But my Aunt seems to have suddenly revised her opinion of him, and now wants me to place all my affairs in the Judge's hands and return east. Such is certainly not my wish.
DAVE: ( significantly ) Looks kinda like she's formed an
DAVE: ( quickly ) For the locality, I mean.
ROCKLIN: ( continues reading ) I wanted so much to give ranch life a trial, but fear circumstances are against me, especially in view of the recent Indian trouble
DAVE: ( explosively ) Indian trouble ( in normal tone ) Good Lord, they ain't been any Indian trouble around here in
ROCKLIN: ( caustically ) You want to hear the rest of this?
DAVE: ( getting the inference ) Might's well come this far.
ROCKLIN: ( reading ) I want to apologize for what took place this afternoon. And I am returning the 150, because I feel it is rightfully yours. You must take it. Faithfully yours, Clara Caldwell.
DAVE: ( feeling his socks ) Well what do you make of it?
ROCKLIN: Somebody's sure bustin' to get her out of there.
DAVE: Indian trouble
ROCKLIN: ( after a pause ) Wonder why the old lady's playin' ( sourly ) Baaa Wimmen Who can ever figure ( pause ) Got to admit though, I feel a mite sorry for the young'un nice little Too nice for this country.
DAVE: ( sourly ) Baaa Wimmen Who can ever figure ( pause ) Got to admit though, I feel a mite sorry for the young'un nice little Too nice for this country.
ROCKLIN: Too nice for this country.
DAVE: ( after a slight pause ) She's shore a pretty thing.
ROCKLIN: Don't know how I could help her even if I wanted to I don't know any thing about this Garvey or Caldwell or
DAVE: Well, now I could mebbe help you out some, there Fact, I could tell you somethin' 'bout ole Red that might be interestin'.
ROCKLIN: You must have known him pretty well What kind of a man was he?
DAVE: Caldwell? The best cantankerous cuss but a real cowman, believe me He was a big feller, like yourself Fact, you coulda passed fer a blood relation, come to think of it.
ROCKLIN: ( casually, as he busies himself with the biscuits ) Was the Judge and Red friends?
DAVE: ( anigmatically ) That's what you'd say. Garvey managed all Red's business. Besides which they was regular drinkin' pals played poker together most nights tho' they do say Red got the worst of it.
ROCKLIN: Red was a gambler, eh?
DAVE: Oh, yeah reckon a pretty poor one, tho' still you'd say him and Garvey was friends.
ROCKLIN: ( after a side glance to Dave ) Anything ever happen to make you think they weren't?
DAVE: ( moves close to Rocklin ) Rock I'm gonna tell you somethin' I ain't never told anybody.
ROCKLIN: ( with a slight smile ) Think you can trust me?
DAVE: The last time I seen Red was the day he died
DAVE: 'Twas in town he jus' come out of the stage office. Tried to book passage to Garden City but couldn't on account I had a full load. Well, sir, he took me aside and give me a printed sheet of paper and says, "Read it." I looked it over and fer as I could see it was a paper from one of them Chicago sportin' firms, tellin' how to manipulate trick playin' cards.
ROCKLIN: Marked cards.
DAVE: ( nods ) Reckon so. Seems Red found some cards and this paper in a coat one of his friends loaned him one night.
ROCKLIN: Whose was it?
DAVE: Well, now that's just what I asked but all he said, was that it belonged to a good friend. Then he said he wasn't waitin' fer the next coach, but was ridin' over to see the district judge about it alone.
ROCKLIN: That's when they got him.
DAVE: Yes, sir 'bout a mile or so from Stan's place. A bullet in the back an' his pockets empty.
ROCKLIN: How come you never told this before?
DAVE: Who was there to tell? Sheriff Jackson? Him an' Garvey's thick as thieves.
ROCKLIN: How about what's his name Harolday? He's no friend of the Judge's, is Hates his guts sure riles him to see young Clint hangin' onto the Judge's coattails. All the same, I jus' decided to keep my mouth shut and my eyes open.
DAVE: Hates his guts sure riles him to see young Clint hangin' onto the Judge's coattails. All the same, I jus' decided to keep my mouth shut and my eyes open.
ROCKLIN: ( after a pause ) Even if it was Garvey Red was talkin' about it don't follow that he killed him.
DAVE: No general opinion is that it was Why would rustlers take the evidence Caldwell had with him?
ROCKLIN: Why would rustlers take the evidence Caldwell had with him?
DAVE: Looks to me if you get the man who owned the marked cards, you get the Funny tho' first the K.C. foreman then Caldwell an' now these women.
ROCKLIN: ( drinking ) Funny tho' first the K.C. foreman then Caldwell an' now these women.
DAVE: Lordy you ain't thinkin' somebody might try bumpin' them?
ROCKLIN: ( slowly, to himself ) I'm not so sure somebody hasn't tried ( to Dave ) Remember, when we stopped to change horses on the way Over from Garden Shore you told me how Jackson and Clews tried to frame Stan.
DAVE: Shore you told me how Jackson and Clews tried to frame Stan.
ROCKLIN: ( nods ) Yeah. Like they wanted to be sure he'd keep his mouth shut about
DAVE: And layin' that gun across my skull an' offerin' to drive the coach
ROCKLIN: ( nods ) It was almost as if
ROCKLIN: ( going to Dave ) You all right?
DAVE: ( blustering ) Will be if I ever get dry.
ROCKLIN: Lookit that
DAVE: Good Lord
ROCKLIN: Come on
DAVE: My team.
ROCKLIN: That's not your team.
DAVE: Come on
ROCKLIN: No use he's gone.
DAVE: Mebbe we winged him.
DOOR: INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT Rocklin has reached the entrance unheard, and silently watches the strange figure, its back to him, now headed for the fireplace with his saddlebag, taken from the bunk. He sees the intruder start emptying his saddlebag on the bench in the light of the fire. He sees him suddenly stop and pick up something hidden from his view. At that instant, Rocklin slams the door shut. The intruder whirls around. It is Arly tense and now defiant. The two regard each other like vicious animals in the same cage. Arly's heart is pounding, but you would never know it. And now Rocklin, his gun away, starts closing in, slowly but Arly holds her ground her eyes never leaving his. When Rocklin reaches Arly, he takes her one hand from behind her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously Clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist. He tries to open her hand, and Arly, knowing she lacks the strength to prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand. But that quick, Rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and tosses it across the room, where it lands on the bunk. Arly relaxes her grip on the letter meanwhile, and Rocklin gets it, and tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at her He turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on the Arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation. And Rocklin's smug manner isn't helping any. He picks up his hat and, glancing at Arly, puts his finger once more through the bullet holes.
ROCKLIN: ( smiling wryly ) Not bad shootin'.
ARLY: ( right back at him ) You think I did that?
ROCKLIN: Sure to draw us away from here. You know, you cut it mighty close Good thing I ain't got brains enough to fill it.
ROCKLIN: ( suppressing smile ) Too bad you had to come 'way up here through that storm for nothin'.
ARLY: ( affectedly ) I haven't minded a bit ( harshly ) because I came up to fire you.
ROCKLIN: ( nods ) I see.
ARLY: Get out of here get off the Santee and don't ever come back.
ROCKLIN: Mind if I wait for Dave? He ought to be along any minute Be funny if he winged that shadow of yours.
ARLY: If you mean Juan you're loco. He's not even up here.
ROCKLIN: ( mildly surprised ) You came up alone?
ARLY: ( half believing her ) Then who was that we took out after?
ROCKLIN: ( half believing her ) Then who was that we took out after?
ARLY: The man who shot at you.
ROCKLIN: Who was he?
ARLY: I don't know.
ROCKLIN: You mean you won't tell.
ARLY: I mean I don't know Why should I lie to you?
ROCKLIN: I guess you forgot you jes' fired
ROCKLIN: ( turning near the open door ) So long.
DAVE'S VOICE: Hey, Rock
DAVE: He got away but guess what, I
ROCKLIN: ( slowly to Dave ) You guess
ROCKLIN: ( to Dave, who is trying to figure things out ) Come on.
DAVE: ( glancing back to the cabin ) Fer a man who's got a despise fer wimmin, you sure do get all snaggled up with 'em.
FADE OUT: FADE IN EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY LONG SHOT of Rocklin as he comes riding into town. As he nears the corner where the stage and Harolday's office is situated, the CAMERA MOVES IN, getting Rocklin and one of the Harolday employees repairing the wooden sidewalk near the hitching rail.
FADE IN: EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY LONG SHOT of Rocklin as he comes riding into town. As he nears the corner where the stage and Harolday's office is situated, the CAMERA MOVES IN, getting Rocklin and one of the Harolday employees repairing the wooden sidewalk near the hitching rail.
ROCKLIN: ( as he dismounts ) You work for Harolday?
ROCKLIN: Here's one of his horses I'll pick up my saddle later.
ROCKLIN: ( frowning ) I thought I sent you up to Table- That's right.
HAROLDAY: ( frowning ) I thought I sent you up to Table- That's right.
ROCKLIN: That's right.
HAROLDAY: ( slowly ) What happened?
ROCKLIN: ( taking off his hat ) Well, this, for one thing.
HAROLDAY: ( after a little pause ) I told you you'd regret letting that rat Clews off so easy.
HAROLDAY: What's the matter? Don't you think it was him, then?
ROCKLIN: ( slowly ) I been figgerin'. Don't seem reasonable Clews was in condition to take that sort of chance alone. Besides how could he have known I was up there that soon. And George Clews ain't the only one I've run contrariwise to in this town. There's that Mexican, for instance.
HAROLDAY: He as good as told me yesterday that him and me was due for a run-in one of those days. And then there's him!
ROCKLIN: He as good as told me yesterday that him and me was due for a run-in one of those days. And then there's him!
CLINT: ( excitedly ) I just heard that that Rocklin ( sees Rocklin )
ROCKLIN: ( slowly ) Was what?
CLINT: ( subdued ) Was shot at last night.
HAROLDAY: ( very calm ) Mr. Rocklin was just telling me all about it. ( significantly ) Any idea who might have done it?
CLINT: Not me.
CLINT: You ain't trying to pin it on me? 'Cause if you are, you're in for a big disappointment. I was over at the Sun-Up playing poker with the Judge and the rest of the boys till early morning. If you don't believe me, ask for yourself.
ROCKLIN: ( after a pause ) All right. I believe you. But that don't mean you couldn't tell a thing or two as would help if you wanted.
CLINT: ( very nervous again ) What d'you mean?
HAROLDAY: ( sharply ) Yes. What sort of thing would Clint here know about, that would help identify the man who tried to kill you last night?
ROCKLIN: This for one. Ever seen it before?
ROCKLIN: Ever seen it before?
CLOSE SHOT: Clint as he stares wide-eyed at the pouch.
MED. SHOT: group, with Rocklin and Harolday both watching Clint intently.
HAROLDAY: ( harshly ) Well, go on speak up. Did you ever see it before?
CLINT: ( avoiding Harolday's eye ) No. Course I didn't ( suddenly raging at Rocklin ) Quit riding me! I don't know nothin' about it I tell you. Jest because I had a run-in with you over a game o' cards, that don't mean I'd sneak up on you in the dark and.
CLOSE SHOT: Harolday and Clint are at window looking past camera toward the street. They see Rocklin carrying his saddle, walking toward the Sun-Up. Shorty Davis hails Rocklin, says something to him and points to the Sun-Up. Rocklin leaves, walking He turns from camera toward the desk.
HAROLDAY: ( frowning deeply ) He means trouble.
CLINT: ( still at window ) Aw, what do I care.
HAROLDAY: ( turning on him with cold fury ) Listen, I never did have much use for you. You're a poor specimen at the best; but as a would-be bad man you're nothing but a laughing stock. Why, the way you lied about that pouch just now wouldn't have deceived a six-year old.
CLINT: ( harshly ) All right, let it go at that. But I got myself to think of. It wouldn't suit me at all just now to have you shown up in public for what you are by that trouble-shootin' cowhand. My advice to you is to get out of the district and stay out. ( taking a key from his vest pocket ) You'll find some money in the safe at the ranch. Take what you need and put the key in the desk drawer. Now

CLARA: Oh, Mr. Rocklin
CLARA: I'm so glad I've found you I was on my way to the Santee and learned you were in town.
ROCKLIN: ( putting his saddle, etc., aside ) Just got in.
CLARA: I feel perfectly awful, running after you like this, but
ROCKLIN: You got trouble, eh?
CLARA: My aunt found out I wrote you and made a terrible scene
ROCKLIN: You haven't signed everything over to that Garvey, have you?
CLARA: No and because I refused, Auntie said she would sign an affidavit that I'm still underage, and then, as my guardian she can do what she Got anything to prove you're not No but Mr. Garvey has a letter that would prove it. My aunt wrote it before we came out here.
ROCKLIN: Got anything to prove you're not No but Mr. Garvey has a letter that would prove it. My aunt wrote it before we came out here.
CLARA: ( after a slight pause ) No but Mr. Garvey has a letter that would prove it. My aunt wrote it before we came out here.
ROCKLIN: S'pose we could get it?
CLARA: He'd never give it to me.
ROCKLIN: ( starts for door ) Wait here.
CLARA: ( with a slight start toward Rocklin ) Oh, please you ( she hesitates, not quite sure what to say ) You won't go getting yourself in trouble I I'd rather give up everything I mean

And, although I am no longer her legal guardian, it behooves me, as her nearest kin, to show continued interest in her affairs The CAMERA HOLDS LONG ENOUGH for the letter to be read. And now the letter begins to be consumed in a flame as the CAMERA PULLS BACK showing the burning letter in Judge Garvey's hand. He is standing over the potbellied stove in his office, and Miss Martin is close to him watching the letter burn. Garvey finally lets it fall from his fingers onto the top of the stove. He lifts the lid, lets the remains fall inside, and smiles to Miss Martin.

GARVEY: What's the idea?
ROCKLIN: These cards
GARVEY: ( attempting to bluff it out ) Anything wrong in a man having cards in his possession?

ARLY: I was just telling Miss Caldwell about well you and me.
ROCKLIN: ( his eyes narrowing ) What about, you an' me?
CLARA: ( sensing the static in the atmosphere ) I think I'd better be going.

CLARA: ( embarrassed ) Oh oh, really I'd rather not
ARLY: ( interrupting ) Go ahead, tell him ( looks at Rocklin and goes on defiantly ) and I dare him to deny it.
ROCKLIN: Deny what?
CLARA: That she was with you last night at the cabin in the mountains.
ROCKLIN: Well why should I deny it?.
ARLY: ( quickly ) And didn't you make love to me?
ROCKLIN: ( this is getting a bit thick for him ) Make love to you
ARLY: ( forcing her point ) You didn't kiss me I suppose?
ROCKLIN: Did you expect me to deny that, too?

FADE IN: EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON ON Clara hurrying toward the front door in a suppressed state of excitement. She has presumably just arrived at the ranch in advance of Miss Martin. She enters the house after a glance toward the gate.
ON: Miss Martin, standing by the window, cold and threatening. She has not taken the time to remove her hat. After a moment's pause, she moves slowly toward Clara. The CAMERA PANS WITH her into a TWO SHOT. Clara, her back pressing harder and harder against the door, becomes more terrified at the other's approach. Miss Martin appraises the girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across the face. Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt.
MISS MARTIN: ( quietly but viciously ) Whatever is to become of you?
MISS MARTIN: Have you no sense of pride, or decency? Throwing yourself at that that wretch, like any shameless hussy.
MISS MARTIN: I thought we'd done with him but no you have to run to him and tell him all our business
MISS MARTIN: Don't you dare deny it you know very well you told him about that letter I wrote Mr. Garvey.
MISS MARTIN: Didn't you?
MISS MARTIN: Didn't you?
DISSOLVE: INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON The office has been more or less cleaned up since the fight. Garvey is discovered near the window. He has cleaned himself up but bears some evidence of the fight. He is reading a letter as Sammy, the K.C. China-boy, stands waiting near the LETTER. The message is written in the same bold hand of Miss Martin already seen in the previous letter: Mr. Garvey, I have just learned that despicable Rocklin person intends to take Clara to Garden City in the morning evidently to have you investigated. I thought you had better know about BACK TO SCENE. Garvey puts the message in his pocket as he addresses Sammy.
GARVEY: Tell Miss Martin that I'll take care of everything.
SAMMY: You take clare of evelything.

DISSOLVE IN: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - NIGHT On Rocklin, stretched across the bed, examining the cards in the light of a lamp.
ANGEL: From Garvey's ANGLE as he sees Dave bringing Clint from around in front of the building toward the stairway.
CAMERA HOLDS: Garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position around the roar corner. He watches the two men approach the stairway and go up. He moves out of the shot now, going toward the street. The CAMERA HOLDS on the corner, and we see Tala come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a moment before. It is apparent that he is watching Garvey, and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of the scene.
ROCKLIN: Come in
DAVE: Here he is, Rock. Caught him jist in time near the Santee. Headed fer out, I'd say.
ROCKLIN: Sit down, Clint. How about goin' down below an' havin' one on me?
DAVE: ( delighted ) Well, now that's right thoughtful Holler if you need me.
CLINT: ( belligerently, as he stands near the window ) What's this all about?
ROCKLIN: ( calmly, as he stands up ) It ain't gonna do you any good to get all het up and tough, kid
ROCKLIN: I just want to ask you a few questions that's all.
CLINT: I told you once, I don't know who owns that pouch and I don't know who shot you.
ROCKLIN: ( calmly ) Forget it that's not what I want to talk to you about, anyway.
CLINT: ( harshly ) Well, what do you want to talk about? Come on, get it over with.
ROCKLIN: Clint I want you to tell me why Garvey murdered Red Caldwell
ROCKLIN: You know don't you?
CLINT: ( shaking ) Me? No!
ROCKLIN: Oh yes you do. And you're going to tell me all about I don't know nothing, I tell you
CLINT: I don't know nothing, I tell you
I: Rocklin slaps Clint's face open-handed, throwing him off balance, then grabs him by the shirt front.
ROCKLIN: I tell ya, I.
CLINT: I tell ya, I.
ROCKLIN: ( hitting him again )
MED. SHOT: window. A gloved hand has come out of the dark and is reaching through the window for Rocklin's gun in the belt which is hanging over the chair.
CLOSE SHOT: Clint and Rocklin. The latter is still looking toward the window. With a swift movement Clint picks up the water jug from the washstand and brings it down on Rocklin's head. As Rocklin falls out of shot, Clint turns to the window with a triumphant smile. Suddenly his expression changes.
CLINT: ( in a hoarse scream ) No! No, don't!
SHOT: window. The hand of the killer pitches the gun toward Rocklin and disappears.
AD LIBS: What happened? Who is it? Clint Harolday Etc.
PAP FOSSLER: Where's Doc Riding?
AD LIBS: Get the Doc. Hey, Doc He was down below. Here he is.
AD LIBS: Look out, men Let the Doc through.

JACKSON: What's the trouble here
JACKSON: ( with a bitter smile ) I warned you, didn't I? Well, I guess this is the last trouble you'll ever make in this town. ( extending his hand ) Hand over that gun.
ROCKLIN: Just a minute, now I know it looks bad but I didn't kill the kid.
ROCKLIN: ( to the crowd, generally ) I know it looks bad but I didn't kill the kid.
DAVE: I believe you. His gun was layin' over there on the floor when I come in and
ROCKLIN: ( cutting in ) No it wasn't It was right in my hand like it is now.
JACKSON: If you didn't know him then who I don't know But I'm going to find out.
ROCKLIN: I don't know But I'm going to find out.
HAROLDAY: ( as he nears Rocklin's door ) Where is he? Where's my boy?
CLOSE SHOT: Harolday, as he sees Clint's body and stops dead in horror. He turns to Rocklin.
HAROLDAY: ( with cold violence ) You murderer.
ROCKLIN: I didn't do it, Mr. Harolday.
HAROLDAY: ( quickly ) Then who did?
VOICE: ( from crowd ) He had a gun in his hand when we come in.
GARVEY: ( smoothly ) And I'll bet it's the same one the bullet that killed Clint came out
HAROLDAY: Well, what do you say to that?
ROCKLIN: He's right.
GARVEY: You admit it.
ROCKLIN: Yeah but that still don't say I killed him.
AD LIBS: Aw, take him away Liar Lock him up, Sheriff The yellow-bellied
ARLY: ( softly ) Why did you do it?
MED. SHOT: with Rocklin in f.g.
ROCKLIN: I didn't.
GARVEY: He admits it was his gun that shot But you didn't fire it.
ARLY: ( whose eyes haven't left Rocklin's ) But you didn't fire it.
ROCKLIN: That's right.
ARLY: What happened?
ROCKLIN: ( slowly ) Clint and me was having a bit of an ( quickly ) What about?
ARLY: ( quickly ) What about?
ROCKLIN: ( searching for words ) About whether he was going to help clear up a few things that's been bothering me and some others 'round these parts. ( looking at Garvey ) For instance who it was shot Red ( still at Garvey ) And the K.C. foreman. And who took that shot at me up at Table-Top last night. And why certain people are so anxious to get rid of the Caldwell How would Clint know about all that?
JACKSON: ( still at Garvey ) And the K.C. foreman. And who took that shot at me up at Table-Top last night. And why certain people are so anxious to get rid of the Caldwell How would Clint know about all that?
ROCKLIN: ( still at Garvey ) And the K.C. foreman. And who took that shot at me up at Table-Top last night. And why certain people are so anxious to get rid of the Caldwell How would Clint know about all that?
PAP FOSSLER: How would Clint know about all that?
HAROLDAY: ( harshly ) He's lying. He's trying to cover up for killing my boy.
JACKSON: ( encouraged by the support ) Quit stalling, Rocklin. Wait a minute he's get a right to be heard. ( to Rocklin ) Well, we're listenin'.
ARLY: Wait a minute he's get a right to be heard. Well, we're listenin'.
ROCKLIN: Well Clint was getting' all set to talk, when somebody snuck up along the verandah there and pulled the gun out o' my belt. . and let him have it.
AD LIBS: What a story! What an alibi! String him up, the heel! Etc.
JACKSON: ( grinning ) You'll have to think up something better than that Rocklin.
MED. SHOT: with Garvey in f.g.
GARVEY: ( smoothly ) Don't be a fool, Rocklin. You know you can't get away with a yarn like that. Why don't you save yourself and everyone else a lot of trouble by surrendering to the Sheriff? After all, it isn't such a crime in these parts to kill a man in self-defense.
ROCKLIN: Everyone knows what Clint was like. He probably lost his head and pulled a gun on you, like he did at the Sun- Up that night. Wasn't that it?
GARVEY: Everyone knows what Clint was like. He probably lost his head and pulled a gun on you, like he did at the Sun- Up that night. Wasn't that it?
ROCKLIN: ( grimly; after a little pause ) No, that wasn't it. And till I do what I got to do, I ain't surrenderin' to anybody least of all to your pal here. ( indicates sheriff ) If I got to be shot for knowing too much, it ain't going to be in the back, in a framed-up jail-break.
CLOSE SHOT: Arly, who has been staring at Rocklin in frowning
ARLY: But if someone's trying to kill you, why didn't they do it just now? Why did they have to kill Clint?
CLOSE SHOT: Guess they wanted to get Clint, too. Doin' it this way they get us both. Clint first an' me afterwards like I jus' said.
ROCKLIN: Guess they wanted to get Clint, too. Doin' it this way they get us both. Clint first an' me afterwards like I jus' said.
MED. SHOT: with Garvey in f.g. Close beside him are Pap and Dave, who watches Garvey closely.
PAP FOSSLER: Quit fancy talk. Who's "they?"
ROCKLIN: I might be able to tell you that No you won't because you're comin' with me.
JACKSON: ( quickly ) No you won't because you're comin' with me.
ROCKLIN: ( raises his gun ) Am I?
ROCKLIN: The first one that moves gets it.
THE BUILDING: And now there is a state of utter confusion as the mob and horses rush in all directions as the men try to retrieve their mounts. Rocklin is no where in evidence.
HAROLDAY: ( sarcastically ) Well, Sheriff you certainly are to be congratulated.
JACKSON: ( harassed ) Look, Mr. Harolday you saw what ( deeply concerned ) Never mind that Let's get going for Garden City that's where he's headed for.
GARVEY: ( deeply concerned ) Never mind that Let's get going for Garden City that's where he's headed for.
HAROLDAY: You sure?
GARVEY: I'm positive.

DISSOLVE: EXT. HIGHWAY - ROAD TO GARDEN CITY - NIGHT A raspy voice is heard coming out of the darkness singing a ribald song of the periods. And now Old Zeke, riding his burro, comes into view. As he passes close to the camera, we PAN and get the posse coming out of the darkness in the opposite direction Zeke is travelling. As the posse pulls up to Zeke, the CAMERA MOVES IN on a group including Zeke, Jackson, Garvey, Harolday.

CLARA: ( unrestrained ) Yes I'm running away and it's all your fault you're the one who's been deceitful and sneaking and don't think I don't know what you intend doing.
MISS MARTIN: ( very controlled ) And don't think I don't know what you intend doing.
CLARA: ( crying, as she moves away ) I don't care I'm not ashamed of it and nothing you can say or do is going to stop me.
MISS MARTIN: ( hardly above a whisper ) You little fool if you go to Garden City with that man you stand to lose everything.
CLARA: ( stops pacing ) But why? Why are you being so secretive? If you know something, why don't you tell me?
DAVE: ( nods and mumbles to himself ) Yeah why don't you?
MISS MARTIN: ( Unmindful of the presence of the men ) All right, I'll tell you Rocklin is a nephew of the late Mr. Caldwell. And, as nearest of kin, he stands to get everything according to the will. Because you are not the old man's niece, but only his grand-niece.
CLARA'S VOICE: And you and Mr. Garvey knew the truth all the time?

ARLY: If only we make it in time.
CLARA: And I heard one of them tell my aunt not to worry, that he was just as anxious as she was to get even with you.

DISSOLVE: INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN In the hall are Clara and Miss Martin, Rocklin, Arly and Julio, Dave and Garvey. Garvey is seated and has evidently been talking in the way of confession.
GARVEY: Harolday wanted the K.C. like he wanted the Santee and the Hardman place, for his land scheme He planned on breaking up the ranches into small holdings and selling to dirt farmers. He pretended to be on the outs with me so I could get Caldwell's confidence. And when Red caught me with the crooked cards and threatened to expose me Harolday shot him.

The first rays of the morning sun streak through the trees across her as she smiles wistfully down at the antics of a little woodchuck cavorting on the ground close to her. In a moment Rocklin comes into view in the b.g. He spots Arly, who has her back to him, and walks over. His approach frightens the woodchuck away, and turns Arly's head toward him.
