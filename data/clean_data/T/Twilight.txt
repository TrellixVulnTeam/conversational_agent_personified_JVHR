TWILIGHT: Written by
SHOOTING DRAFT: February 11, 2008
A DEER: running for its life as it darts through this maze of a forest. It sprints forward, but we gain on it. Beyond the deer, SEE the forest's edge ahead, white sunlight glowing against the trees. The buck races for the light. We're just behind it, about to emerge from the shadowy darkness -
BLONDE #: Good luck at your new school!
BELLA: Have a good..
BELLA: . life.
RENE: It won't work again, baby.
BELLA: You put it on hold.
RENE: I did?
BELLA: Look. You also called Mexico.
RENE: I'll figure it out. You gotta be able to reach me and Phil on the road -
I: love saying that - on the road.
BELLA: Very romantic.
PHIL: If you call crappy motels, backwater towns and ballpark hot dogs romantic.
RENE: Now, you know if you change your mind, I'll race back here from wherever the game is.
BELLA: I won't change my mind, mom.
RENE: You might. You've always hated Forks.
BELLA: It's not about Forks, it's about Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we barely know each other.
CHARLIE: Your hair's longer.
BELLA: I cut it since last time I saw you.
CHARLIE: Guess it grew out again.
CHARLIE: How's your mom?
BELLA: More silence. Yikes. They pass a SIGN: The City Of Forks Welcomes You - Pop. 3246. Bella sighs.
CHARLIE: I put Grandpa's old desk in your
BELLA: ( grimacing ) That's right. One bathroom.
CHARLIE: I'll just put these up in your room
BELLA: I can do it
CHARLIE: Bella, you remember Billy Black.
BILLY: Glad you're finally here. Charlie hasn't shut up about it since you told him you were coming.
CHARLIE: Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you down the hill.
BILLY: Right after I ram you in the ankles.
JACOB: I'm Jacob. We made mud pies together when we were little kids.
BELLA: Yeah. I think I remember..
JACOB: It's getting worse with old age.
CHARLIE: So what do you think of your homecoming gift?
BELLA: No way. The truck is for me?
CHARLIE: Just bought it off Billy, here.
JACOB: I rebuilt the engine and -
BELLA: It's perfect!
JACOB: Okay, so you gotta double pump the clutch when you shift, but -
BELLA: Maybe I can give you a ride to school.
JACOB: I go to school on the reservation.
BELLA: Too bad. Would've been nice to know at least one person.
ERIC: You're Isabella Swan, the new girl. Hi. I'm Eric. The eyes and ears of this place. Anything you need. Tour guide, lunch date, shoulder to cry on.
BELLA: I'm kind of the suffer in silence type.
ERIC: Good headline for your feature
BELLA: I no, I'm not news I'm, seriously, not at all
ERIC: Whoa, chillax. No feature.
BELLA: ( relieved ) Would you mind just pointing me toward Mr. Varner's class?
ERIC: You've missed a lot of the semester, but I can hook you up - tutor, cliff notes, medical excuse..
JESSICA: Block it, Chloe! Yeah! Good attack!
MIKE: ( hurries to him,
BELLA: ( hurries to him,
MIKE: It's only a flesh wound.
MIKE: You're Isabella, right?
BELLA: Just Bella.
MIKE: I'm Mike. Newton.
JESSICA: She's got a great spike, doesn't ( to Bella ) So, you're from Arizona, right? Aren't people supposed to be tan down there?
BELLA: That's why they kicked me out.
ERIC: Mike, you met my home girl Bella.
MIKE: Your home girl?
JESSICA: ( to Bella ) It's first grade all over again, and you're the shiny new toy.
ANGELA: Sorry, needed a candid for the feature
ERIC: Feature's dead, Angela. Don't bring it up again.
ANGELA: ( disappointed ) Guess we'll just run another editorial on teen drinking.
BELLA: Sorry. There's always eating disorders, or Speedo padding on the swim team
ANGELA: Wait, that's a good one..
BELLA: Who are they?
ANGELA: The Cullens.
JESSICA: Doctor and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids. They all moved down here from Alaska two years ago.
ANGELA: They kinda keep to themselves.
JESSICA: Because they're all together. Like, together together. The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett..
JESSICA: . they're a thing. I'm not even sure that's legal.
ANGELA: Jess, they're not actually related.
JESSICA: But they live together. And the little dark haired girl, Alice, she's really weird..
JESSICA: . she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like he's in pain.
I: mean, Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad slash match maker.
ANGELA: Maybe he'll adopt me.
BELLA: Who's he?
JESSICA: That's Edward Cullen.
JESSICA: He's totally gorgeous, obviously. But apparently, no one here is good enough for him. Like I care.
BELLA: I wasn't planning on it.
MR. MOLINA: Welcome, Ms. Swan. Follow along as best you can till you get caught Mr. Molina gestures to the only empty seat. next to Edward. But as Bella approaches, she's taken aback when
MR. MOLINA: ( to the class, animated )
MR. MOLINA: We're going to cut them in half, then watch them regenerate into two separate worms..
MR. MOLINA: . Yes, folks, zombie worms! They just won't die.
EDWARD: There must be something open sixth
ADMINISTRATOR: No, every class is full. I'm
EDWARD: ( to the Administrator ) I'll just. endure it.
BELLA: As she tries to start the car, choking the engine, we begin to hear a MAN'S RAGGED, FRIGHTENED BREATH
A: HAND grips his shirt, then YANKS him out of the air and out of frame with incredible strength. His guttural SCREAM is choked short as BLOOD SPRAYS THE LANDING..
CORA: Can't get over how grown up you
A: bearded, hippy logger, WAYLON FORGE, 50, appears behind Cora, leaning over her shoulder to Bella
WAYLON: Member me, honey? I was Santa one year.
CHARLIE: Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four.
WAYLON: Bet I made an impression, though.
CHARLIE: You always do.
CORA: Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon.
BELLA: ( doesn't remember at all ) That'd be great, thank you.
BELLA: So. you eat here every night?
CHARLIE: Easier than washing dishes.
BELLA: I can cook.
BELLA: I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. Mom's not great in the kitchen.
CHARLIE: I remember..
CHARLIE: How was school? Meet anyone?
BELLA: A few people. Do you know the Cullen family?
CHARLIE: ( looks up sharply ) Are people talking about them again?
BELLA: No. well, a little.
CHARLIE: Just cause they're newcomers. We're lucky to have a surgeon like Dr. Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky his wife wanted to live in a small town. Lucky his kids aren't like lot of the hell-raisers around here.
BELLA: . Okay.
CHARLIE: I just don't like narrow And he returns to his food. Silence.
BELLA: Mom, where's your cell?
RENE: Ok, I didn't lose my power cord. It ran away. Screaming. I literally repel technology now.
RENE: Now, tell me more about your
BELLA: ( a beat, lying )
BELLA: Dad, I'm heading out.
BELLA: WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her Dad, I can drive myself to school.
BELLA: Dad, I can drive myself to school.
CHARLIE: You okay, Bells?
BELLA: Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated.
CHARLIE: That's why I got you new tires. She looks over at the truck yep, four new tires.
CHARLIE: The other ones were nearly bald.
BELLA: You got me new tires. No one's ever done that before.
BELLA: I mean. nothing.
CHARLIE: I'll be late for dinner. I'm heading down to Mason County. A security guard at the Grisham Mill got killed by some kind of animal..
BELLA: An animal?
CHARLIE: You're not in Phoenix any more, honey. They've been hunting it for a week with no luck. Thought I'd lend a hand.
BELLA: Be careful.
CHARLIE: Always am.
BELLA: And thank you. For the tires.
ERIC: . and yeah, prom committee is chick thing, but I gotta cover it for the paper anyway, and they need a guy to help choose the music -
MIKE: Come on, Arizona. Give it up for the rain.
BELLA: She heads toward her seat, brushing off her hair. But she freezes when she sees Edward.
EDWARD: Bella stops. Stunned. He is direct, precise, as if every word is an effort for him.
EDWARD: I didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week. My name is Edward Cullen.
EDWARD: ( prompting ) . You're Bella.
BELLA: I'm. yes.
MR. MOLINA: ( to the class ) Onion root tip cells! That's what's on your slides. Separate and label them into the phases of mitosis. The first partners to get it right, win. the golden onion!
MR. MOLINA: Come on, people. Tick tock.
EDWARD: Ladies first.
BELLA: You've been gone.
EDWARD: Out of town. For personal reasons.
BELLA: She begins to remove the slide.
EDWARD: May I look?
EDWARD: ( muttering ) Like I said.
BELLA: ( muttering ) Like I said.
EDWARD: Enjoying the rain?
BELLA: Seriously? You're asking me about the It appears.
EDWARD: It appears.
BELLA: No. I don't like the cold. Or the wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks.
BELLA: He shakes his head and turns to the microscope, switching out
EDWARD: She snaps out of it. Covers with a dry look.
BELLA: May I?
EDWARD: Like I said.
EDWARD: ( handing her the slide ) If you hate cold and rain, why move to the wettest place in the continental U.S.
BELLA: It's complicated.
EDWARD: I think I can keep up.
BELLA: My mother remarried.
EDWARD: Very complex. So you don't like him.
BELLA: Phil is fine. Young for her, but nice enough.
EDWARD: Why didn't you stay with your mom
BELLA: Alright, Phil's a minor league
I: decided to spend time with my
EDWARD: But now you're unhappy.
BELLA: No. I I just..
EDWARD: I'm just trying to figure you out.
BELLA: Did you get contacts?
EDWARD: . no.
BELLA: Your eyes were black before, now
EDWARD: It's just the fluorescents.
MIKE ERIC: Are you okay!? Are you What happened!? Did anyone
CHARLIE: Bells. Are you alright?
BELLA: I'm fine, dad. Calm down.
TYLER: I'm so sorry, Bella. I tried to stop.
BELLA: It's okay, Tyler.
CHARLIE: It sure as hell is not okay.
BELLA: Dad, it's not his fault-
CHARLIE: ( stern, cutting her off ) We nearly lost you.
BELLA: But you didn't.
CHARLIE: You can kiss your license goodbye.
CHARLIE: Good. Dr. Cullen.
DR. CULLEN: ( to E.R. Doctor ) I've got this one, Jackie.
DR. CULLEN: You have a nice knot growing back there, but your x-rays show no indication of concussion.
TYLER: I'm so sorry, Bella. I'm really
BELLA: It would have been a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of the way.
CHARLIE: Edward? Your boy?
BELLA: It was amazing he got to me so fast. He was nowhere near me.
DR. CULLEN: ( smiles ) As long as you're safe.
CHARLIE: I just have to sign some paperwork. You better call your mom.
BELLA: You told her?! She's probably freaking.
ROSALIE: This isn't just about you, it's about all of us -
DR. CULLEN: Let's take this in my office.
BELLA: Can I talk to you for a moment? ( off his nod ) How did you get over to me so quickly?
EDWARD: I was standing right next to you.
BELLA: You were next to your car, across the lot.
EDWARD: No, I wasn't.
BELLA: Yes. You were.
EDWARD: You're confused. You hit your head.
BELLA: I know what I saw.
EDWARD: And what, exactly, was that?
BELLA: You stopped that van. You pushed it away.
EDWARD: No one will believe that.
BELLA: I wasn't planning to tell anyone.
BELLA: I just want to know the truth.
EDWARD: Can't you just thank me and get over it?
BELLA: Thank you.
EDWARD: You're not going to let it go, are you?
BELLA: ( turns, walks away ) Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.
EDWARD: ( turns, walks away ) Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.
BELLA: Why did you even bother?
EDWARD: . I don't know.
MR. MOLINA: Make sure I get your permission slips.
MIKE: ( ala Dr. Frankenstein ) Look! You're moving. You're ALIVE!
BELLA: . Yeah, false alarm..
MIKE: Actually, I'm glad you're not dead cause - well, that would suck, plus
I: wanted to ask you - even though it's, like, a month away..
MIKE: So what do you think? ( off her blank look ) You want to go? To prom. With me.
BELLA: ( realizing, horrified ) Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go
MIKE: You can't go another weekend?
BELLA: Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you should ask Jessica.
MR. MOLINA: .c'mon, Eric, stuff that compost down deep. that's it..
BELLA: Hello, Edward.
BELLA: No response. She turns, starts to walk away.
EDWARD: What's in Jacksonville?
BELLA: How did you know about that?
EDWARD: You didn't answer my question.
BELLA: You haven't answered any of mine. You won't even say hello.
EDWARD: And how did you stop that van?
BELLA: And how did you stop that van?
EDWARD: Adrenaline rush. Very common. Google it.
BELLA: ( not buying it ) Floridians. That's what's in She turns to storm off but she stumbles over the irrigation hose. Edward steadies her, catching her scent still so powerful. He clenches his jaw.
EDWARD: It helps if you actually watch where you put your feet.
EDWARD: I know I've been rude, but it's for the best.
JESSICA: Guess who just asked me to prom!
JESSICA: I totally thought Mike was going to ask you, Bella. Is it gonna be No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together.
BELLA: No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together.
JESSICA: I know, right?
EDWARD: Bella, it would be better if we weren't friends.
BELLA: ( wounded ) Too bad you didn't figure that out ( MORE ) BELLA ( cont'd ) You could have let the van crush me and saved yourself all this regret.
EDWARD: ( snapping, angry ) You think I regret saving you?
BELLA: I know you do.
EDWARD: ( furious ) You don't know anything.
ALICE: The bus is leaving. ( to Bella ) Hi. Will you be riding with us?
EDWARD: No. Our bus is full.
CHARLIE: Your mother called. Again.
BELLA: Your fault, for telling her about the accident.
CHARLIE: She always did know how to worry.
BELLA: He is.
ERIC: La Push, baby. You in?
BELLA: Should I know what that means?
MIKE: La Push beach, down on the Quileute rez. We're all going after school. Big swell coming in.
ERIC: And I don't just surf the internet.
JESSICA: Eric, you stood up once. On a foam There's whale watching, too. Come with.
ANGELA: There's whale watching, too. Come with.
ERIC: La Push, baby.
BELLA: I'll go if you stop saying that.
EDWARD: ( charmed ) Edible art..
BELLA: Thanks. but your mood swings are giving me whiplash.
EDWARD: I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.
BELLA: What does that even mean?
EDWARD: It means if you were smart, you'd avoid me.
BELLA: So let's say, for argument's sake, that I'm not smart. Would you talk to me? Tell me the truth?
EDWARD: Probably not. I'd rather hear your Okay. how bout radioactive spiders? Kryptonite?
BELLA: Okay. how bout radioactive spiders? Kryptonite?
EDWARD: ( levels his gaze,
BELLA: ( beat, looking closer at him ) No. I don't believe that. You're not bad. You can be a jerk, but it's like this. mask. To keep people away.
BELLA: Look, why don't we just - hang out. Like. come to the beach with us. It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt water stinging your eyes..
EDWARD: ( small smile, considering it ) Which beach?
BELLA: La Push.
BELLA: Is something wrong with that beach?
EDWARD: It's just a little crowded.
ANGELA: I keep thinking Eric's going to ask me to prom, then he just. doesn't.
BELLA: You could ask him. ( off Angela's flustered
ANGELA: I am?
BELLA: Guys, this is Jacob. Are you stalking me?
JACOB: You're on my rez, remember? You Definitely not.
BELLA: Definitely not.
JESSICA: ( teasing ) Keep her company. Her date bailed.
ERIC: What date?
JESSICA: She invited Edward.
BELLA: ( embarrassed ) To be polite.
ANGELA: I think it's nice she invited him. No one ever does.
MIKE: Because Cullen's a freak.
SAM: You got that right.
BELLA: You know them?
SAM: ( sharply ) The Cullens don't come here.
BELLA: You want to go look at tide pools?
BELLA: So, what did your friend mean about the Cullens not coming here?
JACOB: Oops. Caught that, huh?
JACOB: I'm not supposed to say anything.
BELLA: I can keep a secret..
JACOB: ( laughing ) It's just an old scary story. Did you know the Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
BELLA: Like fur, fangs . doggy breath?
BELLA: So the legend about the Cullens is..
JACOB: Well, they're supposedly descended from this, like..
BELLA: Didn't they just move here?
JACOB: Or just moved back.
BELLA: Riiiight. So what was this treaty?
JACOB: ( whispering ) If they promised to stay off Quileute lands, we wouldn't expose what they really were to the pale-faces..
AAAAAAAAGH!!!!!!: Bella JUMPS at the bloodcurdling scream, as Angela runs past, chased by Eric waving a dead crustacean. Jacob smirks and starts back to the group.
BELLA: Wait. what were they really?
JACOB: ( laughing ) It's just a story, Bella.
WAYLON: Waylon pulls off the headphones. WHISTLES. No dog. Waylon walks up a walkway. then sees a DOG LEG, sticking out from under a bush.
WAYLON: Come on, Jerry, you old mutt..
A: vampire. But his eyes, unlike the Cullens, are a deep, sinister BURGUNDY, and absolutely lethal. His catlike movements are always on the edge of a crouch.
WAYLON: H-how did you do that?
JAMES: Always the same inane questions..
JAMES: What do you want?
VICTORIA: Why are you doing this?
LAURENT: ( sighs, slight French accent ) . James, must we?
JAMES: The question should be, will it hurt?
JESSICA: Whenever the weather's nice, the
BELLA: They just. ditch?
JESSICA: No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank em
ANGELA: I'm going to the prom with Eric!
I: just asked him, I took control!
BELLA: It's a family thing.
JESSICA: Oh my God, we need to hit the stores in Port Angeles before the dresses get cleaned out.
BELLA: Port Angeles?..
ANGELA: Thank God. We need your opinion.
JESSICA: I think this halter makes my boobs look big. What do you think, Outside the window, a group of rowdy FRAT BOYS head toward bar. Two of them stare at Jessica in her low-cut dress. Embarrassed, she turns back to Bella.
JESSICA: ( absently ) It looks great.
BELLA: ( absently ) It looks great.
JESSICA: You said that about the last five ( empathetic ) You're not very good at this, are you?
ANGELA: ( empathetic ) You're not very good at this, are you?
BELLA: Maybe I should just go check out the
ANGELA: You sure?
JESSICA: She was right about this halter,
BELLA: Look, just take my bag.
EDWARD: Get in.
BELLA: What no, how did you find
EDWARD: ( through gritted teeth ) I should go back and rip their heads off.
BELLA: No. Bad idea.
EDWARD: You don't know the vile, repulsive things they were thinking.
BELLA: And you do?
EDWARD: ( covering ) Not hard to guess.
ANGELA: Where were you!? We left you a message.
JESSICA: We waited, but we were starving
EDWARD: Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We ran into each other and got talking.
JESSICA: I - we - understand. We were just. leaving, so
BELLA: Okay, well. Thank you.
EDWARD: ( abruptly ) Maybe I should make sure Bella gets something to eat.
ANGELA: That's so. thoughtful.
JESSICA: Really thoughtful.
BELLA: ( debates, then decides ) I could eat.
BELLA: You're not eating?
EDWARD: I'm on a special diet.
BELLA: Like South Beach?
EDWARD: Not exactly.
BELLA: So how bout some answers?
EDWARD: Yes, no. To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851.
BELLA: I didn't ask for the square root of pi.
EDWARD: You knew that?
BELLA: How did you know where I was?
EDWARD: I didn't.
EDWARD: ( stops her, sincerely ) Don't go.
BELLA: Were you following me?
EDWARD: I feel very protective of you.
BELLA: So that's a yes?
EDWARD: Yes, I followed you. I tried to keep my distance.until you needed ( putting everything together ) You said before. That you heard what those guys were thinking..
BELLA: ( putting everything together ) You said before. That you heard what those guys were thinking..
EDWARD: ( shrugs ) I'm thinking of getting a nine- hundred number.
BELLA: ( trying to grasp ) Alright, so you read minds. What am I thinking? Wait okay now, go.
EDWARD: I have no idea. I can read every mind in there, except yours.
BELLA: Why, what's wrong with me?
EDWARD: I tell you I read minds and you think there's something wrong with you?
BELLA: What is it?
EDWARD: I. don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore.
BELLA: Edward, you don't have to.
EDWARD: ( almost to himself ) This is wrong.
BELLA: You're cold. We should go.
EDWARD: You're cold. We should go.
BELLA: I think I'm warm enough now.
BELLA: Your hand, it's still freezing cold.
BELLA: ( concerned ) Dad's here late. Something must have happened.
EDWARD: That's my father's car. What's he
EDWARD: Carlisle. What happened?
DR. CULLEN: Waylon Forge was found in the woods out near his place. I just examined the body.
BELLA: He died? How?
DR. CULLEN: Animal attack.
BELLA: The same kind that killed the security guard down in Mason?
DR. CULLEN: Most likely.
BELLA: So it's getting closer to town.
EDWARD: Waylon lived all the way down on Queets River. 75 miles south.
BELLA: But that's
DR. CULLEN: ( with a kind, reassuring
BELLA: Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon.
CHARLIE: Known him going on thirty years.
CHARLIE: We'll get to the bottom of this, Bella. But in the meantime..
CHARLIE: . I want you to have this.
BELLA: That's probably not a good
CHARLIE: It'll give me some peace of mind.
BELLA: . it's not possible..
ROSALIE: Edward, don't go. But Alice gently removes Rosalie's hand from his arm.
ALICE: He's already there.
BELLA: You're impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold. Your eyes change color. And sometimes you speak like. you're from a different time.
BELLA: How old are you?
EDWARD: How long have you been seventeen?
BELLA: How long have you been seventeen?
EDWARD: . A while.
THEM FASTER: I know what the Cold Ones are. What you are.
BELLA: I know what the Cold Ones are. What you are.
EDWARD: Say it. Out loud. Say it.
BELLA: . Vampire
EDWARD: Are you afraid?
BELLA: ( angry ) Then ask me the most basic question: what do we eat?
EDWARD: ( angry ) Then ask me the most basic question: what do we eat?
BELLA: You won't hurt me. You're different.
EDWARD: You think you know me?
BELLA: Where are we going?
EDWARD: Up the mountain. Out of the cloud bank. You need to see what
I: really am. What I look like in the harsh light of the sun.
BELLA: No! The sunlight will kill you.
EDWARD: Myth. You need to see the truth.
BELLA: Slow down.
EDWARD: Are you afraid?
BELLA: Then come with me. Someplace where no one can protect you. Where
EDWARD: Then come with me. Someplace where no one can protect you. Where
I: could do what I've wanted to do from the first moment I met you.
BELLA: I'm not afraid.
EDWARD: You should be.
EDWARD: Hold on.
EDWARD: Are you afraid!
BELLA: But she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in altitude. Higher and higher, above the fog layer. Finally, up ahead
BELLA: Edward? Where are you?
EDWARD: This is why we don't show ourselves
EDWARD: This is what I am.
BELLA: You're. beautiful..
EDWARD: ( appalled ) Beautiful? I'm a killer, Bella. This is the skin of a killer.
BELLA: I don't believe that.
EDWARD: Because you believe the lie. The camouflage. I'm the world's most dangerous predator. Everything about me invites you in - my voice, my face, even my smell. As if
I: need any of that..
EDWARD: As if you could outrun me. As if you could fight me off.
EDWARD: I'm designed to kill.
BELLA: I don't care.
EDWARD: I've killed people.
BELLA: It doesn't matter.
EDWARD: I wanted to kill you. I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life. I'm dangerous to you.
BELLA: I trust you.
EDWARD: I trust you, Edward. I'm here.
BELLA: I trust you, Edward. I'm here.
BELLA: She looks over to FIND he's on the other side of the meadow, catching his breath.
EDWARD: You. took me by surprise. ( collecting himself ) I don't know how to. do this.
EDWARD: Me, and my family, we're different from others of our kind. We're not nomadic, we have a permanent home. We only hunt animals. We've learned to control our thirst..
BELLA: ( realizing ) Oh. I thought you hated me when we met.
EDWARD: I did. For making me want you so badly. I'm still not sure I can control myself.
BELLA: I know you can.
EDWARD: I wish I could understand this thing you see in me. You look at me with those eyes..
BELLA: I'm afraid.
EDWARD: ( devastated ) She sinks down in front of him.
BELLA: Not of that. I'm afraid. you'll disappear. That I'll lose you.
EDWARD: ( amazed, elated ) You don't know how long I've looked for you.
EDWARD: Be very still.
EDWARD: And so the lion fell for the lamb.
BELLA: Stupid lamb.
EDWARD: Sick masochistic lion.
BELLA: How long have you been like this?
EDWARD: Since nineteen-eighteen. That's when Carlisle found me.
BELLA: Where'd he find you?
EDWARD: In a hospital, dying of Spanish influenza. My parents had already died.
EDWARD: Not just. Our bite contains venom. And once we taste blood, a sort of..
EDWARD: First with me, then with his wife, Esme. He found her in a hospital, as well. The others followed.
BELLA: Does someone have to be dying to become like you?..
EDWARD: . No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do. this, to someone who had another choice.
BELLA: So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people.
EDWARD: Not the only reason.
EDWARD: I don't want to be a monster.
EDWARD: We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way. For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu. It keeps you strong but isn't very Then abruptly, he whips past Bella. She turns to see him standing on a large rock in the river.
BELLA: Show off.
EDWARD: It's not that impressive, really. Anyone in my family can do this.
BELLA: Can they all read minds, too?
EDWARD: No, that's unique to me. But Alice can see the future.
BELLA: ( fishing ) Really? Bet she saw me coming mile away.
EDWARD: Her visions are very subjective. The future can change.
EDWARD: Come to my house tomorrow.
BELLA: Your house? With your family?
BELLA: But. what if they don't like me?
EDWARD: ( laughing heartily ) You're worried, not because you'll be in a houseful of vampires, but because you think they won't approve of you?
BELLA: I'm glad I amuse you.
BELLA: What is it?
EDWARD: A complication.
EDWARD: I'll pick you up tomorrow.
BELLA: Come to visit your truck?
JACOB: Looks good. You got that dent out.
BILLY: Actually, we came to visit your flat screen. First Mariners game of the season. Plus Jacob here kept bugging me to see you again.
JACOB: ( mortified ) Great, Dad. Thanks.
CHARLIE: Pale Ale.
BILLY: ( holds up a brown paper

CHARLIE: It's a Friday night. Go out. The Newton boy's got a big smile for you. Nice family, the Newtons.
BELLA: He's just a friend.
CHARLIE: None of the boys in town interest you?
BELLA: We're not really going to talk about boys, are we?
CHARLIE: Just. you should be around people. I leave you alone too much.
BELLA: ( with genuine affection ) I've never minded being alone. Guess I'm a lot like my dad that way.
CORA: Berry cobbler, two forks.

BELLA: You've been here before?
EDWARD: What else is there to do at night?
BELLA: You're a peeping Tom! Perv!
EDWARD: Shh! The Chief will hear you!
EDWARD: I just. like watching over you.
EDWARD: There's something I'd like to try.
BELLA: ( mortified ) Oh. I'm. oh.
EDWARD: I'm stronger than I thought.
BELLA: Wish I could say the same. I'm so Don't be. But we have to be careful. ( serious ) I can never lose control with you. Ever.
EDWARD: Don't be. But we have to be careful. ( serious ) I can never lose control with you. Ever.
BELLA: I have a date with Edward Cullen.
CHARLIE: He's too old for you.
BELLA: We're both juniors. I thought you liked the Cullens.
CHARLIE: And I thought you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.
BELLA: Edward doesn't live in town. And it's in the early stage and -
CHARLIE: Now? He's out there?
BELLA: He wants to meet you. Officially.
CHARLIE: He cocks the rifle in mock-seriousness.
BELLA: Be nice, okay? He's. important.
EDWARD: Chief Swan. I wanted to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward.

EDWARD: ( amused ) Your father thinks you should go to an all-girl's school.
BELLA: No fair, reading Charlie's mind.
BELLA: And since when do vampires like baseball?
EDWARD: It's the American pastime. Plus, there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the only time we can play. You'll see why.
ESME: Good thing you're here. We need ( big crooked grin ) She thinks we cheat.
EMMETT: ( big crooked grin ) She thinks we cheat.
ESME: I know you cheat. Call em as you see em, Bella.
ALICE: It's time.
BELLA: ( to Esme ) Now I get why you need the thunder.
BELLA: That has to be a home run.
ESME: Edward's very fast.
BELLA: Yer out?
ALICE: Stop! I didn't see them..
ALICE: They're traveling so quickly
ROSALIE: You said they left the county -
ALICE: They did, but then they heard us..
EDWARD: ( to Bella ) Put your hair down
ROSALIE: Like that'll help. I could smell her from across the field.
EDWARD: I shouldn't have brought you here. I'm so sorry.
LAURENT: I believe this belongs to you.
DR. CULLEN: Thank you.
LAURENT: Could you use three more players?
DR. CULLEN: Of course.
LAURENT: I'm Laurent. This is Victoria. And James.
DR. CULLEN: Would you like to bat first?
DR. CULLEN: I'm afraid your hunting activities have caused something of a mess for us.
LAURENT: Our apologies. We didn't realize the territory had been claimed.
DR. CULLEN: Yes, we maintain a permanent The three newcomers exchange a look of surprise.
LAURENT: Really? Well, we won't be a problem any more.
VICTORIA: The humans were tracking us, but we led them East-
JAMES: You brought a snack.
DR. CULLEN: The girl is with us.
LAURENT: ( trying to defuse situation ) We won't harm her.
EMMETT: ( hungry for battle ) Just try it.
DR. CULLEN: I think it best if you leave.
LAURENT: Yes, I can see the game is over. We'll go now. James?
DR. CULLEN: Get Bella out of here. We'll follow Dr. Cullen, Jasper and a resentful Rosalie race off after the three vampires. Edward scoops Bella up as we
EDWARD: James is a tracker. I saw his mind. The hunt is his obsession, and my reaction set him off -
EDWARD: We're a large clan of strong fighters all protecting one vulnerable human.
EDWARD: The first place he'll go is your house. He'll track your scent ( horrified ) What?!? Charlie's there. He's in danger because of me. Because of ( calmly ) Then we'll lead the tracker away from him. Somehow.
BELLA: ( horrified ) What?!? Charlie's there. He's in danger because of me. Because of ( calmly ) Then we'll lead the tracker away from him. Somehow.
EDWARD: ( calmly ) Then we'll lead the tracker away from him. Somehow.
BELLA: I said, leave me alone!
EDWARD: Bella, don't do this. Just think about it, please
BELLA: Get out! It's over.
CHARLIE: Bella? What happened?
BELLA: I have to get out of this place. Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now.
BELLA: ( a pained whisper ) I can't hurt him.
CHARLIE: Bells. Did he hurt you?
BELLA: No, Dad.
CHARLIE: Then what? Did he break up with you?
BELLA: I broke up with him.
CHARLIE: I thought you liked him?
BELLA: That's why I have to leave. I don't want this. I want to go home.
EDWARD: ( whispering ) I'll be in the truck.
CHARLIE: Your mother's not even in Phoenix.
BELLA: She'll come home. I'll call her from the road.
CHARLIE: You can't drive home now. I'll take you to the airport in the morning.
BELLA: I want to drive. I need time to think. I'll pull into a motel in few hours. I promise.
CHARLIE: Bells, I know I'm not around much,
BELLA: Like watch more baseball on the flat
CHARLIE: Bella. I just got you back.
BELLA: And if I don't get out now, I'm
EDWARD: He'll forgive you. ( off Bella's startled look ) Slide over..
BELLA: His face. I said the same words my mother used when she left him.
EDWARD: It was the only way he'd let you go.
EDWARD: Your father's safe now, Bella. The tracker is following us
EDWARD: It's alright. It's just Emmett. Alice is in the car behind us.
DR. CULLEN: He came to warn us. About James.
LAURENT: I've grown tired of his games. But he's got unparalleled senses. Absolutely lethal. I've never seen anything like him in three hundred years . And the woman, Victoria, will back him. Don't underestimate Dr. Cullen nods thanks. Laurent looks at Edward, apologetic.
LAURENT: I'm truly sorry for what's been unleashed here.
JASPER: I've had to fight our kind before. We're hard to kill.
EDWARD: But not impossible. We'll tear him up
EMMETT: ( with bloodlust ) We'll rip him apart with our hands, then burn the pieces
DR. CULLEN: I don't relish killing another creature. Even a sadistic one like James.
ROSALIE: If he doesn't get to one of us ( horrified ) This is insane. You can't put yourselves in danger like this - for me.
BELLA: ( horrified ) This is insane. You can't put yourselves in danger like this - for me.
ROSALIE: Too late.
EDWARD: I'll run Bella south, while you lead the tracker away
DR. CULLEN: No, Edward the tracker thinks you won't leave Bella. He'll follow you.
ALICE: I'll go with Bella. Jasper and
I: will drive her south.
EDWARD: ( studies her, torn ) Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
EDWARD: Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent.
ROSALIE: ( dropping the clothes ) Why should I? What is she to me? Just a danger you've inflicted on us
DR. CULLEN: ( spinning on her ) Rosalie. Bella is with Edward. She's a part of this family now. And we protect our family.
BELLA: If any of you get hurt because of me
EDWARD: We won't, there are five of us, two of them. When it's done, I'll come get you.
EDWARD: You're my life now.
BELLA: Mom, it's me again. You must have
BELLA: I wish he'd call.
ALICE: You should eat.
BELLA: They could get hurt. It's not worth it.
JASPER: ( insistent ) Yes. It is.
JASPER: Edward's changed since he found you. And none of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you.
JASPER: What do you see?
ALICE: ( with deep worry ) The tracker. He just changed course..
JASPER: Where will it take him, Alice?
ALICE: Mirrors. It's a room of mirrors.
BELLA: How do the visions work? Edward said they weren't always certain.
JASPER: She sees the course people are on, while they're on it. If they change their minds, the visions change.
BELLA: So the course James is on now will lead him to. a ballet studio?
ALICE: ( looks up at her ) You've been here?
BELLA: No. I don't know. I used to take ballet lessons as a kid. The school had an arch like that.
JASPER: Was your school here in Phoenix?
BELLA: Yeah, around the corner from my house. But I haven't been there in ten years.
JASPER: Do you have any reason to go now?
BELLA: No. Hell, no. I hated the place.
BELLA: Edward. Are you alright?
EDWARD: I'm coming to get you. ( hates having to say
BELLA: ( sinking ) This is my fault. You warned me, but I didn't think. I just..
EDWARD: Bella, we're in too deep. We can't change how we feel..
BELLA: No. we can't. ( then ) When will you get here?
EDWARD: In a couple hours. Then you and
I: will go somewhere. Together. The others will keep hunting.
BELLA: Mom, I'm so glad you got my -
BELLA: Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, okay? I'll explain every
BELLA: . Mom? Are you there?
JAMES: I was prepared to wait for you. But then Mom came home after she received a very worried call from your Dad. It all worked out quite Bella's eyes are wild with fear.
JAMES: I must say, Forks High School doesn't protect its students' privacy very well. It was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address.
BELLA: Leave my mother out of this.
JAMES: You're protective of her. That's nice. You can still save her. But you'll need to get away from your friends. Can you do that?
BELLA: I. don't think so.
JAMES: If your mother's life depends on it?
BELLA: Where should I meet you?
JAMES: The old ballet studio around the corner. And I'll know if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake.
BELLA: ( taking a breath for courage ) 8th and Palo Verde, please.
I: love seems like a good way to go..
A: ballet bar wraps around the walls -
BELLA: Everyone makes fun of me.
RENE: But you're a wonderful dancer.
BELLA: Mom, I suck.
JAMES: That's my favorite part. Stubborn child, weren't you?
BELLA: She's not here.
JAMES: Sorry. But you really made it too easy.
JAMES: So to make things more entertaining, I'm going to make a little film of our time together. Borrowed this from your house. Hope you don't mind.
JAMES: Excellent! An escape attempt.
JAMES: It'll break Edward's little heart.
BELLA: Edward has nothing to do with this.
JAMES: He will. His rage will make for more interesting sport than his feeble attempt to protect you.
JAMES: Beautiful! Very visually dynamic. I chose my stage well.
JAMES: Still stubborn, aren't you? Is that what makes you special? Because frankly, I don't see it.
JAMES: Too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you. Instead, he kept you this fragile little human. It's cruel, really.
JAMES: Well done! You've succeeded in annoying me.
JAMES: Tell Edward how much it hurts.
JAMES: Tell him to avenge you.
BELLA: No! Edward, don't..
JAMES: Cut! The end.
JAMES: You're alone. because you're faster than the others. But not James SMASHES Edward's face into the mirror until it cracks.
EDWARD: I'm strong enough to kill you.
DR. CULLEN: Her femoral artery's been severed. She's losing too much blood
BELLA: It's on fire! My hand!
EDWARD: Venom -
DR. CULLEN: ( working on Bella )
EDWARD: BELLA'S POV -ALICE appears behind Edward, fuzzy, indistinct.
ALICE: It's going to happen. I've seen it
EDWARD: It doesn't have to be that way.
DR. CULLEN: Alice, find me a tourniquet.
A: rag, a shirt.
BELLA: It's burning!
EDWARD: What's the other choice? You said
DR. CULLEN: ( to Alice ) Tighter, above the knee
EDWARD: DR. CULLEN You can try to suck the venom out.
DR. CULLEN: You can try to suck the venom out.
EDWARD: I won't be able to stop
DR. CULLEN: Find the will to stop. But choose, she only has minutes left.
EDWARD: It's alright, Bella. I'll make it go away.
DR. CULLEN: Stop. Her blood is clean, you're killing her.
BELLA: Life. is harder..
BELLA: Edward? Where's -
RENE: He's asleep. She nods across the room to a chair in which Edward sleeps.
RENE: He never leaves. And your dad's down in the cafeteria.
BELLA: What. happened?
RENE: Baby, you fell down two flights of stairs and through a window.
RENE: Edward came here to convince you to come back to Forks. His father brought him down. You went to their hotel but you tripped on the stairs. A moment. then Bella realizes it's a cover story. She nods.
BELLA: Sounds like me.
RENE: It's Phil. He's worried about you.
BELLA: Mom, you're. texting.
RENE: ( smiling ) I told him to stay in Florida. The Suns signed him!
BELLA: That's great mom.
RENE: Jacksonville is always sunny and you'll have your own bathroom..
BELLA: Mom, wait. I want to live in Forks. I have Dad..
RENE: ( re: Edward ) And he's there.
RENE: Charlie doesn't like him. Blames him for your leaving.
BELLA: What do you think?
RENE: ( lowering her voice ) I think that boy is in love with Bella smiles. Rene grins. Bella glances at Edward.
BELLA: Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad?
I: want to talk to him. Apologize.
RENE: I'm sure he doesn't care about that, Baby. But Ill go get him.
BELLA: Is James - did you
EDWARD: We took care of him. And the woman, Victoria, she ran off.
BELLA: I'm alive because of you.
EDWARD: ( darkens ) You're in here because of me.
EDWARD: The worst of it. was thinking
I: couldn't stop -
BELLA: But you did.
EDWARD: Bella, you should go to Jacksonville. Where I can't hurt you anymore..
BELLA: What? No! I want to be with you!
I: don't want
EDWARD: ( sitting next to her ) Sssh. It's alright. I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here..
BELLA: Alice lent me the dress. It was the
EDWARD: You're perfect. I'll take good
CHARLIE: Heard that before.
CHARLIE: ( sotto ) I put new pepper spray in your bag.
BELLA: . and. you look beautiful.
CHARLIE: . and. you look beautiful.
BELLA: I can't believe you're making me do
BELLA: You really are trying to kill me.
EDWARD: Prom is an important rite of passage. I don't want you to miss She can't be mad at him, just shakes her head affectionately. They continue into the prom. Several heads turn. Bella sees
EDWARD: Shall we?
BELLA: ( laughs, then realizes ) You're serious.
EDWARD: See? You're dancing.
BELLA: At prom.
BELLA: Edward. why did you save me? ( off his questioning look ) If you'd let the venom spread, I could've been like you by now.
EDWARD: ( stops, horrified ) You don't know what you're saying. You don't want this.
BELLA: I want you. Always.
EDWARD: ( angry ) I won't end your life for you.
BELLA: I'm dying anyway. Every minute, I get closer, older
EDWARD: That's how it's supposed to happen.
BELLA: Not the way Alice saw it. ( off his sharp look ) I heard her. She saw me like you.
EDWARD: Her visions change, Bella.
BELLA: Based on what someone decides. And I've decided.
EDWARD: Is that what you dream about? Becoming a monster?
BELLA: I dream about being with you forever.
EDWARD: You really want this?
BELLA: He lowers his lips to her neck. One bite is all it would take.
EDWARD: You're ready right now?
BELLA: His lips hover over her skin, a long beat. then he presses his lips to her throat. Not a bite. A kiss. He looks at her.
EDWARD: You're going to have a long and happy life with me. Isn't that She looks at him. and finally smiles.
BELLA: For now.
