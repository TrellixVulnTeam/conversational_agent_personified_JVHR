Phoebe: Now, have you told anyone else?
Phoebe: You told me.
Chandler: Me too.
Joey: Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)
Chandler: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? 
Chandler: Oh all right.
Phoebe: Yeah, coffeehouse.
Ross: Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Ross: How rude.
Phoebe: So how are things going with Paul?
Rachel: So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his
head against a table?
Paul: (entering) Hi honey.
Rachel: Hi!
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Watch this.
Paul: (To Rachel) How are you?
Rachel: (To Phoebe) Okay.
Phoebe: Hi Paul!
Paul: Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe: So how are things going with you?
Paul: (whispering) Come on.
Rachel: Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)
Paul: (To Ross) Hey!
Ross: Hi!
Paul: Ross! 
Ross: Great to see you!
Paul: Good to see you too!
Ross: How you doing?
Paul: Good. Bye! (Starts to leave.)
Ross: Okay! You take care! 
Ross: Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off
before?
Phoebe: Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Ross: What?! Why?!
Phoebe: Please, I think you know why.
Ross: I guess it could.
Paul: Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Paul: It was fine.
Rachel: Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Paul: Are you talking about having sex?
Paul: Normal.
Paul: Nope! That never happened to me!
Paul: Nope.
Paul: Okay.
Rachel: Okay.
Paul: Okay.
Rachel: All right.
Paul: When I was six years old.
Rachel: Hm-mmm.
Paul: I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic
chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a
pretty tough year.
Paul: It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao
Chicken!
Paul: Chicken? (Pointing to himself.) Chicken boy!
Phoebe: Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this
gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Phoebe: (coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is,
this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from
here on out.
Chandler: Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Phoebe: Or not, whatever.
Phoebe: Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much is it?
Phoebe: We will give you $10.
Chandler: Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Phoebe: We stand firm at $10.
Ross: Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Joey: No.
Ross: Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Joey: Yeah.
Gunther: (handing them the bill) Here you go.
Ross: Oh. (Starts to get his money) 
Ross: All the time?
Joey: All the time!
Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Monica: Still crying?
Paul: Rachel?
Chandler: No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)
Paul: (acting manly to try and cover up his crying) Okay. Chandler, did your dad
ever hug you?
Chandler: No, did he hug you?!
Chandler: Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Paul: Hey Chandler?
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs
Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)
Paul: Five more seconds.
Chandler: Okay! (Pushes him away.)
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Paul: Joey! (Goes over and hugs Joey and picks him off of his feet.)
Chandler: Do you have my credit card?
Chandler: Thank God! (Grabs his card.)
Joey: Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Phoebe: Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)
Chandler: What?
Chandler: They put you in jail?
Phoebe: The little jail between the doors!
Chandler: Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
Chandler: Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Phoebe: Maybe it was the guy.
Chandler: It was the ring!
Ross: Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
Joey: No! He blew us off!
Ross: What?!
Joey: I know!
Joey: Can I tell you something? Me too.
Joey: Ooooh! Freeze him out.
Joey: I like it!
Rachel: A lover?
Paul: A surfer.
Rachel: Oh yeah surfer?
Paul: I would really like that. (They kiss.)
Phoebe: (entering from her room) Hey.
Phoebe: There he is! (Points.)
Chandler: Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Phoebe: Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me
please? You have a phone call.
Customer: Who is it?
Phoebe: It is your office.
Customer: Do you know who at my office?
Phoebe: John?
Customer: Oh John! Great!
Phoebe: (To Chandler) Here he is.
Phoebe: Wow! I would trade.
Chandler: Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)
Customer: (looks at it) All right. (Exchanges rings.)
Joey: (To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Ross: Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Chandler: Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)
Joey: Oh my God!!
Ross: So you two are really serious?!
Chandler: Yep, pretty much.
Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be so
happy!
Chandler: I know.
Chandler: Check out the ring.
Rachel: (gasps) Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Phoebe: (entering) Hi.
Ross: Hey-hey Pheebs!
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Ross: You told her before you told us?
Chandler: Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can
understand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game
on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)
