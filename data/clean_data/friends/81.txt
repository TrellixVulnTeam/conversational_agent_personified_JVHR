Ross: Hey! 
Phoebe: Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious
mouth full, nods yes.)
Ross: 15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and
Joey mumbles, no!)
Phoebe: Where were you?
Ross: Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum
upstate.
Chandler: Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Phoebe: Oh, which museum?
Phoebe: (just Phoebe) No, answer his.
Chandler: Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Chandler: Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
All: Hey!
Monica: Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Phoebe: Oh.
Monica: I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they
had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and
Monica glares at him.)
Joey: Ohhh!
Joey: Good enough to get fired.
Joey: Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy
direct Burger King commercials?
Chandler: (he glares at him for a while) Yes.
Chandler: See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Mike: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas
party, Rachel?
Chandler: (to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Mike: Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch
Basel Hadens.
Phoebe: (singing) Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey!
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Phoebe: Oh, yay!
Joey: What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail.
Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Rachel: Oh yeah!
Phoebe: Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
Chandler: (entering) Hello, children!
All: Hey!
Chandler: (to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Rachel: Really?!
Joey: Sure! Where are the seats?
Rachel: So, will I like any of these guys?
Rachel: Chandler!
Phoebe: (shocked) You work with robots!!
Chandler: Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit
cards.
Rachel: Op, I like credit cards!
Rachel: Well, so what does he do?
Chandler: Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Rachel: Your company has a fine foods division?
Joey: Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
Phoebe: No! No, the robots just work for them.
Joey: Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
Ross: Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
Chandler: Oh yeah! With who?
Ross: You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Chandler: Yeah.
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Chandler: Hey, man!
Phoebe: Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Joey: (checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)
Joey: (entering from the dining room) Hey.
Monica: Hey.
Joey: You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens
to be over her breast.)
Monica: What are you doing?!
Rachel: (entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Chandler: Well, like father, like son.
Rachel: Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this
could maybe turn into something serious.
Chandler: Ummmmmmmm, no.
Monica: Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Monica: Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like
you did the other night?
Monica: What the hell happened?!
Monica: What kinda things have you been saying?
Joey: Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Phoebe: What?
Chandler: Bad dream?
Phoebe: So, did you pick one yet?
Phoebe: Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Chandler: Prague?
Rachel: Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not
tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Chandler: I did! I absolutely did!
Rachel: You idiot!!
Chandler: I know! I know!
Rachel: Really?
Chandler: Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Rachel: No.
Rachel: Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Rachel: Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)
Chandler: Have you ever been with a woman?
Rachel: What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Chandler: So there is no good time to ask that question.
Monica: I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me
some more swordfish?
Monica: You did a minute ago!
Monica: Fine!
Monica: You do?
Monica: Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from
earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!
Ross: (waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting
next to him)
Ross: What?
Ross: (now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!
Ross: Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Monica: Thanks.
Monica: Enough!
Joey: (leaving) Lean-lean-lean!
