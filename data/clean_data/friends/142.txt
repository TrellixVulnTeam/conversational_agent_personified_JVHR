Rachel: Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Ross: (sitting up) No! (Exits.)

Charlie.
Chandler: (entering) Ahh, third base.
Monica: (gasps) We had a caricaturist!
Rachel: Oh!! 
Phoebe: (singing, angrily) 
Rachel: Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Monica: And yet, here we are doing it again.
Monica: Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Ross: Got me. (He shows of his hands.)
Monica: I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Rachel: I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Monica: Oh, is that why you did it in the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Chandler: (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.
Rachel: (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from
your night?
Chandler: Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)
Ross: Oh, I see, so everybody wins. 
Rachel: Who is it?
Rachel: Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to
follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)
Ross: Oww!
Rachel: Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May
we help you?
Chandler: How is that ever going to happen?!
Rachel: All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
Monica: I know why!
Monica: Okay! Why?!
Rachel: Because! Because I was sad.
Monica: What do you mean?
Chandler: Thanks.
Ross: (at the door) And uh, Rachel.
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe: (singing)
Phoebe: Oh thank you.
Chandler: Okay. (Goes back to bed.)
