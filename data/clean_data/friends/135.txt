Rachel: Who wrote it?
Ross: Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Joey: Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a
girl?
Chandler: Oh, is that against the rules?
Ross: No, but it is frowned upon.
Chandler: I see.
Chandler: Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Joey: No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Joey: Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the
call or what?
Chandler: Yeah so, Tuesday?
Joey: (angrily) Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this,
the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What
day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
Chandler: (sarcastically) Thank you.
Joey: Okay.
Chandler: You just thought of that in there?
Monica: Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Rachel: (on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To the
gang.) Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Rachel: (on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the fire
department, there was a fire at our place!
Phoebe: Oh my God! How bad was it?
Monica: Come on! (The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.)
Chandler: What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Joey: The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
Burt: (another professor) Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your
grades this semester! (Ross frantically starts to change some as a female student,
Elizabeth, approaches.)
Elizabeth: Professor Geller?
Ross: (startled) Yeah?
Elizabeth: I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Ross: Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a
thumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)
Ross: That was you?
Ross: What time?
Ross: Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)
Ross: Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Phoebe: Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a
cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through! 
Phoebe: Oh!
Rachel: My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.)
Joey: (to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this
Thursday?
Joey: Oh, how bad is it?
Rachel: (stands up) Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be
hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Monica: (pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us.
Chandler: Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Phoebe: No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
Chandler: Hi.
Monica: Hey!
Joey: Ah-ha!
Chandler: No, we only went out once.
Monica: You dated her!
Chandler: Not once!
Joey: Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns
around to see Chandler glaring at him.)
Dana: No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee
first!
Chandler: The nerve huh?
Dana: Yeah!
Chandler: Refill?
Monica: Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Phoebe: Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should
get to stay here.
Phoebe: Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Rachel: Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)
Rachel: I have.
Joey: I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)
Elizabeth: Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
Ross: What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Elizabeth: Who?
Elizabeth: Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Ross: Umm, no. No.
Elizabeth: Yes you did! What was it?
Burt: (exiting from a restaurant) Dr. Geller!
Ross: (pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!
Phoebe: So did you sleep well last night?
Rachel: I did. 
Phoebe: Yeah?
Rachel: I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: Gum!
Phoebe: Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
Rachel: Oh.
Phoebe: Thanks Monica!
Monica: Does that smell bother you?
Phoebe: I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Monica: Okay!
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens)
Really?!
Ross: Yeah. What-what should I do?
Monica: Joey that is so sweet.
Chandler: (entering) Hey.
Joey: Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a
block of time open say Thursday?
Ross: Going out with who?
Chandler: Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Chandler: No, that was Dana Caplin.
The Guys: Ohhhh! (They all look up in a moment of reflection.)
Joey: Ah whatever!
Chandler: Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Chandler: Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should
stay!
Dana: Of course!
Chandler: Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Dana: What?! Anything! Anything! 
Chandler: Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I
have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this
umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on
Thursday?
Dana: Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if
your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Phoebe: Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Monica: Yes it has! I made cookies!
Phoebe: Okay. (Reaches for one.)
Monica: Okay!
Monica: (opening the door) What are you doing?
Rachel: Oh, Joey! Sorry!
Rachel: Really?
Joey: Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
Joey: I know.

paper towels.)
