Ross: Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the
table.)
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hey.
Monica: (seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers!
It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Monica: (reading) Oh dear God!
Ross: But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
Monica: What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Ross: Yeah, they all know.
Monica: Oh my God, this is horrible!
All: No!
Rachel: Ross!
Ross: (startling him) What?! What?
Rachel: I am freaking out!
Ross: Are ya?
Rachel: My due date is in one week! 
Ross: What are you doing up?
Rachel: That is seven days!
Rachel: (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have
any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not
have a diaper service!
Ross: (annoyed) Yeah!
Chandler: I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
Joey: I thought you already have a job.
Joey: Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
Monica: Hey Joey, come taste this.
Joey: What is it?
Joey: You cooked him?
Monica: No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before
we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I
cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits:
I was wrong about Monica."
Cashier: Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?
Rachel: Oh.
Ross: Oh.
Ross: Oh, okay.
Cashier: I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.
Cashier: Really?! That is so cool!
Ross: Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Ross: I am like Indiana Jones.
Rachel: Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Phoebe: What?!
Rachel: Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started
flirting with him.
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe: Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man,
we-we must alert the church elders!
Chandler: (entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!
Phoebe: Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
Phoebe: Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
Chandler: Why not?
Chandler: What about it?
Chandler: (shocked) What?!
Chandler: Are you serious?!
Phoebe: Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah."
I was like, shhh!
Chandler: What is it that I do?
Chandler: (To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?
Monica: I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would
like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
Joey: Either eat it, or be in it.
Monica: Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?
Monica: I can.
Monica: Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has
shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon. 
Monica: Monica.
Monica: Okay. (Does so.)
Rachel: All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you
about keeping Ben in your life?
Katie: Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. (A
blanket.)
Katie: Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job
description.
Ross: Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living
room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)
Katie: Sure!
Rachel: So you guys go, have a really good time.
Rachel: So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
Katie: Are you okay with this?
Rachel: Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.
Katie: Okay. It was nice to see you.
Rachel: Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you
missed a button.
Chandler: An hour.
Chandler: Phoebe!
Chandler: Chandler Bing.
Phoebe: Bing, what an unusual name.
Joey: Hi.
Joey: When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
Joey: Cheese makes me thirsty.
Joey: All right.
Phoebe: I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
Phoebe: You gotta go!
Chandler: Oh! (Stands up.)
Chandler: Really?
Chandler: Okay.
Joey: Yeah!
Monica: You do?
Chandler: That I did. That I did.
Chandler: (nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.
Chandler: (trying not to laugh) I see.
Chandler: (really try not to laugh) Good to know.
Chandler: (relieved) Really?!
Ross: Hey.
Ross: How are you?
Ross: Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
Rachel: Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
Ross: I liked her.
Rachel: Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you
Indiana Jones!
Ross: Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
Ross: Why? What was wrong with her?
Rachel: There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
Ross: (laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?
Ross: Okay.
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: (starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)
Ross: Do you feel better?
Ross: Uh Rach?
Rachel: Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no, no!
Ross: Rach?
Rachel: Yeah?
Ross: The bathroom?
Rachel: Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)
Monica: Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
Joey: What the hell!
Monica: Okay.
Joey: Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)
