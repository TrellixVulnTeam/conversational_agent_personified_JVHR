Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Chandler: What are you guys doing?
Monica: I know, but look at me: all tan.
Monica: Chandler what do you say?
Chandler: How about those three-pointers?
Ross: Amazing!
Ross: Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy? We call him Hums While He
Pees.
Chandler: Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Phoebe: (returning) Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Rachel: Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Ross: Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
Chandler: They have that on the napkins at the club.
Rachel: Oh, I gotta get back to work.
Rachel: Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh!
I could just spread him on a cracker.
Rachel: Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend
so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Chandler: Dude that is so sad.
Ross: I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Chandler: Could I play?
Rachel: Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
Tag: I just did them.
Rachel: Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
Tag: What?
Rachel: Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Tag: Yeah, I filled them out last night?
Rachel: Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Melissa: Hey Rachel!
Melissa: Umm, is Tag here?
Rachel: No. Why?
Melissa: Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
Rachel: Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Melissa: Oh no!
Rachel: Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Chandler: Okay. (Does The Face.)
Chandler: No, I am.
Monica: Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a
beautiful smile.
Chandler: I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)
Monica: Or not.
Rachel: Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Joey: All right, I guess this will be fine.
Rachel: Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Joey: Nothing, why?
Joey: Yeah, okay.
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: Yeah!
Joey: Okay. (He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills all
over himself. He tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)
Chandler: Aww! (Smiles.)
Chandler: Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Monica: Do you really want to pull at that thread?
Phoebe: Okay, I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the couch.) Hey Ross?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: What?! No!
Phoebe: Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (She
holds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)
Phoebe: Hi Ginger.
Ross: All right! I want my key back!
Phoebe: Ugh, okay Sherlock! (Hands over the key.)
Phoebe: Okay.
Ross: Hi Whitney.
Whitney: Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
Ross: Yep. (Phoebe slams the door shut.) Okay.
Whitney: Sure.
Ross: Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended
up having a great time! Okay?
Phoebe: Watching ballroom dancing?
Phoebe: Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad
stuff about her.
Ross: Like what?
Ross: Okay.
Phoebe: And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Ross: Yeah!
Phoebe: (interrupting him) No listen to me! She is crazy!
Phoebe: You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Tag: Good morning.
Rachel: Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
Tag: Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Tag: Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women! 
Rachel: Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Tag: Well kinda old, like 30.
Rachel: (Pause) Oh.
Tag: And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like
20 phone numbers last night.
Tag: A little.
Rachel: Yeah?
Joey: All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when
I take resume shots?
Chandler: Borrow money from me?
Chandler: Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Joey: I had a donut. (Chandler nods.)
Rachel: (entering) Hi!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Rachel: So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Rachel: Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Joey: What?
Rachel: All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and
unsatisfying this dating tons of women thing is!
Joey: (shocked) What?!
Joey: I know, Monica told me.
Chandler: Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Rachel: Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)
Chandler: Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their
attention.)
Rachel: (To Joey) So, will you talk to him?
Tag: Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
Tag: Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
Tag: Really?
Joey: Yeah, for you!
Monica: (seeing him approach) Hey! There you are!
Chandler: There I am!
Monica: Are you okay?
Chandler: Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an
antihistamine.
Monica: What?!
Chandler: Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to
Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Monica: Chandler, what were you thinking?
Monica: Chandler?
Chandler: (awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)
Phoebe: Hi.
Ross: Hi.
Phoebe: So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Ross: I think he can be.
Ross: Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Ross: (angrily) I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That
was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Phoebe: (gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!!
Tag: Good morning Rachel.
Tag: Went out with Joey.
Rachel: Oh yeah? Another night of bird-dogging the chickas?
Rachel: Wow! I did not see that coming.
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: Sp-spoil?
Tag: Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Tag: Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
Tag: And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about
it right?
Rachel: Yes! Hell yes!
Rachel: Okay.
Tag: What?
Rachel: (panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it)
Hello?! (Listens) Oh, yeah! (To Tag) This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves and
she closes the door behind him, disgustedly.) Yeah!
Ross: My God!
Phoebe: Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part.
Whitney: We kinda need to talk.
Phoebe: Both of you together?
Ross: Oh just say it Kyle!
Phoebe: What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Whitney: I do know.
Ross: It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
Ross: Yeah, we're better off without them.
Monica: Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Chandler: Ahhh.
Monica: Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.)
Chandler: Oh yeah, that looks good.
Phoebe: You guys make a very attractive couple. (The camera cuts to a
shot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)
Joey: Yeah, we look great together.
Monica: Yeah, we really do!
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
