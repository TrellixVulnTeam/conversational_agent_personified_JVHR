Ross: So this is your office?
Phoebe: What the hell are you doing?!
Phoebe: Why not?!
Chandler: The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use
the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Ross: Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to
your hotel room?
Chandler: No.
Ross: Then you are neither of your parents!
Phoebe: But look Chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than I
do. But I totally believe you can do this.
Chandler: Depends on what you mean by we.
Rachel: Okay. But wait!
Monica: What?!
Rachel: Right.
Monica: How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Rachel: Oh!
Joey: I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Richard: That can be arranged.
Joey: What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Joey: Thank you. Thank you.
Joey: I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Richard: Now, that can be arranged! (He brings his sword back and drops it,
causing it to fly over the wall.) Slippery little bugger!

Phoebe: Okay.
Ross: Hi! (To Mrs. Bing) Hi! (Mr. Bing starts rubbing his arm.) Hi. Has umm,
anyone seen Chandler?
Mrs. Bing: As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding
dress.
Ross: Oh my God! Monica!
Monica: Are you okay?
Ross: Uh-huh.
Ross: These-these are beads of joy.
Ross: Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a
flight risk?!
Richard: Well have we finished the scene?
Richard: As were you.
Richard: Why? Are we done for the day?
Ross: (turning a corner) There he is!!
Chandler: What?
Phoebe: Hey! Oh!

The Rabbi: I am Father Kalebasous.
Monica: (To Rachel) He took off?
Rachel: Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)
Joey: Chandler?
Joey: You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in
me by the
state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do
you take each other?
Chandler: I do.
Monica: I do.
Joey: Yeah you do!
Ross: Rings?
Joey: We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To
Chandler) Now kiss her again.
Chandler: (To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.
Monica: What baby?
Chandler: Our baby.

Chandler: Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Rachel: Uh-huh.
