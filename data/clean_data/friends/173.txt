Rachel: (coming from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs?
Phoebe: Huh?
Phoebe: Oh. Why not?
Phoebe: Wow! Oh well, I will be there! 
Rachel: Thank you.
Chandler: Her what?!!
Chandler: You had a bachelorette party?!
Phoebe: She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!
Chandler: You went home with the waitress.
Joey: Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
Monica: Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me
in the ass!
Dr. Green: How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
Phoebe: Rachel!
Phoebe: Why, so he can get mad at the baby?
Dr. Green: I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting
to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.
Rachel: Phoebe!
Dr. Green: Are you really pregnant?
Rachel: Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Who?
Rachel: February 2nd!
Mona: So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.
Ross: Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a
little.
Ross: Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
Mona: So, I gotta get going.
Mona: Yeah. 
Ross: Okay, bye. 
Mona: Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection.
It was amazing! (She leaves.)
Chandler: My God! You must be good in bed!
Joey: Hot?
Ross: Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
Chandler: What?
Monica: Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to
come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
Joey: Will you let the lady talk?!
Ross: Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods his
agreement.)
Monica: Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
Joey: Yeah!
Chandler: And Joey.
Monica: Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
Chandler: Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
Chandler: I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor
party?
Dr. Green: I just called a friend of mine.
Rachel: Yeah?
Dr. Green: I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
Rachel: Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! (Hugs him and Phoebe glares at
her.) Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
Dr. Green: What is it sweetie?
Dr. Green: What?!
Rachel: Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
Joey: So you uh, nervous about getting married?
Chandler: What are you doing?
Stripper: Hi!
Chandler: Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)
Stripper: So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
Joey: Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
Stripper: So is that a bedroom? (Points to the guestroom.)
Chandler: Yeah, yeah right over there.
Chandler: That was weird.
Joey: Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
Mona: I love your place! Where is this guy from? (A statue from the top of his
apothecary table.)
Ross: So much more.
Dr. Green: So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel
pregnant!
Mona: You got Rachel pregnant?!
Ross: Who did?!
Dr. Green: You did!
Ross: Yes. Yes, yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was, it was just a one night
thing. It meant nothing.
Mona: What?!
Ross: (to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!
Dr. Green: Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!
Mona: Tramp?!
Joey: I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
Hooker: Do you mind if I smoke in here?
Mona: How could you have kept all of this from me?
Monica: My husband.
Stu: You hired your husband a hooker?
Monica: Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
Joey: Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
Chandler: Why would she do that?
Chandler: This is the worst bachelor party ever!
Joey: In a minute!
Joey: All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
Chandler: Why me?!
Chandler: Which is why you should do it.
Chandler: You do it!
Joey: You do it!
Chandler: All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!
(Joey smirks.) What?
Joey: I miss this.
Joey: No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
Joey: You got it. Come here. (They hug and are observed by the hooker.)
Hooker: Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys. (Does the close
sign.)
Ross: Rachel!
Ross: Okay!
Rachel: Okay.
Ross: Thank you!
Ross: Thank you so much for coming back over.
Ross: Focus.
Mona: How can I be sure on that?
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the
little things go!
Ross: Trying to date this woman.
Rachel: Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and
thoughtful he is. (Rubbing his shoulder.)
Rachel: I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean
we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? (Mona looks at
her.) I am so gonna leave right now. (Ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)
Ross: Should I leave this open for you too?
Mona: Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
Chandler: Monica! Wait!
Monica: What?
Chandler: (puts on his crown) Carry on.
Chandler: Could you not narrate?
Monica: Gotcha sailor. (Kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchen
knocking something down, but she continues to strip.)
Phoebe: (entering, quietly) Wow, you told your dad the truth.
Rachel: About an hour ago.
Phoebe: Wanna go see a movie?
Rachel: Yes! (She gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging it
up.) Bye daddy. (Phoebe and her leave.)
