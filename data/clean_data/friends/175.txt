Monica: Hey! So what do you think?
Chandler: Oh my God!
Monica: I know.
Chandler: She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.) 
Rachel: (entering) Hi!
Monica: Hey.
Rachel: Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
Chandler: I have you.
Phoebe: How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
Phoebe: Okay.
Ross: Bye.
Rachel: Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey)
Rachel: Hi.
Rachel: No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren
clothes to prison. It is a waste.
Joey: Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
Joey: Okay, so will you meet with her?
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah. Why?
Phoebe: Sting has a son that goes there too!
Phoebe: You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur
stuff you tell us?!
Ross: Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about to
sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)
Ross: What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
Monica: Hey guys!
Chandler: Hey-hey.
Rachel: Hi Monica!
Monica: Hey. (Sits down on the arm of the couch.)
Rachel: Hi boots.
Chandler: You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to
pay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)
Monica: (almost crying) They hurt so much!
Phoebe: What?!
Monica: The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Phoebe: Well then get your money back and return them!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: (returning to his seat) Hey!
Phoebe: Oh no! Why not?
Phoebe: How come?!
Phoebe: Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
Phoebe: Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
Ross: What?
Phoebe: (singing) Rosssss can!
Phoebe: (singing) Rossss can!
Phoebe: (singing) Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the
tickets!!
Joey: (entering, with Dina) Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
Joey: My little sister Dina!
Rachel: Right! Hi Dina! 
Dina: Hi.
Rachel: Nice to meet you. (They shake hands.)
Monica: (standing up) Ahhhhhhhh!
Chandler: Why not?
Chandler: Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Chandler: You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with
skirts, dresses, and pants!
Chandler: Okay.
Dina: Thank you.
Rachel: Okay.
Joey: Is that a sandwich?!
Joey: (angrily) What?!
Rachel: (To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (She
quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)
Dina: Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!
Dina: Why? Where are you going?
Dina: Wow.
Rachel: I know.
Phoebe: Oh, there you are Ben!
Ben: Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
Phoebe: Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they
have famous fathers.
Ben: I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there. (Goes over to
Doug.)
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
Monica: Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb
down through the manhole cover?
Chandler: What?
Monica: How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Chandler: Hop on.
Rachel: What college was that Dina?
Dina: Oh my God! Bobby!
Bobby: Hi Dina. Good to see you.
Rachel: Joey, what are you doing?
Rachel: Oh Joey this is crazy!
Dina: No!
Dina: Yes I do!
Bobby: Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
Joey: Well what am I supposed to do?
Rachel: Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina)
Right?
Rachel: Oh, come on kids! A little help here!
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: Why else would I be here?
Phoebe: Uh-huh. (They go and sit down.)
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm,
all the while thinking about the children of course.
Phoebe: Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
Phoebe: The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.)
Chandler: Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
Monica: (notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Monica: My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the
price?
Monica: Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!
Chandler: Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
Monica: Okay. (Climbs back on his back.) All right.
Chandler: Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)
Joey: (to Dina) You were right. He is funny.
Rachel: (To Dina) Really? (Nods her head at Bobby.)
Rachel: Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
Dina: Excuse me?
Joey: One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
Rachel: So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Bobby: And by you.
Joey: Come here! (Hugs Dina and Bobby looks to hug Rachel.)
Phoebe: Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
Phoebe: Oo, where are the seats?
Ross: Uh, middle balcony.
Ross: Yeah.
