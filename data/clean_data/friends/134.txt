Ross: Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
Chandler: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Chandler: Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Joey: Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down
on me all the time!
Chandler: (reminiscing) Ah, finally an explanation.
Gunther: (approaching with a tray with an order on it) Joey!
Joey: Yeah?
Joey: Uhh do it?
Joey: Well, where was I? (Takes a sip of the coffee.)
Ross: Hi!
Phoebe: Hey!
Ross: Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Phoebe: Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Ross: Wow!
Rachel: Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Joey: Takes it out of you? (Laughs.)
Rachel: Yeah!
Rachel: Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Ross: Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi
can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Phoebe: You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or
your kettle of fish?
Chandler: Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Phoebe: No.
Ross: No.
Joey: And of course, crotchless panties. 
Rachel: Aw, I love that.
Phoebe: You guys!
Rachel: (interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like
so much fun.
Chandler: Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Phoebe: Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
Phoebe: What is that?
Chandler: Nothing!
Ross: So what are you gonna do?
Chandler: Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Rachel: Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Oh, yeah.
Chandler: Do we have to make the entire thing?
Chandler: Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place
where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Chandler: (sticking his head back in) What?
Joey: Thanks. (Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points to
one.)
Joey: Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on
attractive nurse receptionists.
Ross: DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Phoebe: Ross!!!
Rachel: What the hell was that?!
Ross: A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thing
every time now.)
Joey: (in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin.
Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot to
reveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then back
at his script.)
Chandler: Hey.
Ross: (not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?
Chandler: Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to
the moon.
Ross: Why not?
Chandler: Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate
Monica" on the bottom.
Ross: Oh.
Rachel: Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)
Chandler: Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Monica: Sure! Okay, you go first.
Chandler: Okay, come here! Come here.
Monica: Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the
couch.)
Monica: Okay.
Chandler: But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Monica: Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Monica: Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Chandler: Okay!
Monica: Okay, you ready to open yours?
Chandler: Yeah!
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Chandler: Not really.
Chandler: (thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They
both run into the bedroom.)
Chandler: Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way to
young to have seen that!
Chandler: You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Monica: We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.)
Chandler: Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)
Monica: Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was
too expensive?
Chandler: You have done enough!
Monica: I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Monica: Oop, your cake is ready!
Chandler: Oop!
Monica: Who the hell are you?!
Joey: Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Chandler: Who the hell is Carl?!
Joey: Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a
medical research project.
Monica: The only problem!
Carl: (sticking his head back in) Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Joey: (to Carl) Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! (Carl does so.)
Phoebe: Pat Sajak?
Rachel: Yep!
Phoebe: Alex Trebek?
Rachel: Oh, of course!
Phoebe: Chuck Woolery?
Rachel: Say it!
Phoebe: Say we are unagi!
Rachel: Say it!
Carl: Another Minute Maid fiasco.
Joey: (gets very angry) Damnit Carl! (Carl goes to say something more, and Joey
silences him with a grunt.)
Joey: Damnit Carl!
Chandler: Oh my good God.
Monica: Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3,
macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Chandler: Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Monica: I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to
that tape you made me.
Chandler: Oh, the mixed tape.
Monica: The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Monica: You are just the sweetest. (They kiss.)
Ross: Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.)
Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the
woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Ross: No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Ross: I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Chandler: I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Monica: (not buying it) Uh-huh.
Chandler: And I will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and
do anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)
Monica: Okay.
Chandler: Okay. (They hug.)
Chandler: So, are we going in there?
Monica: I am!! (Enter her room and closes the door behind her.)
Ross: Ah-ha, nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)
Phoebe: (stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!
Phoebe: Why is Ross doing that?
Ross: DANGER!!!!
Rachel: Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Phoebe: We should help him!
