Rachel: So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
Monica: This bottle opener. (She grabs it off of the freezer door.)
Rachel: And?
Rachel: Look at that!
Rachel: What?!
Ross: (in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen, matey!
Ross: What?
Phoebe: What?!!
Ross: (answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?
Rachel: No-no, I bought those.
Monica: Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Rachel: Yeah. (Rachel walks away.)
Monica: Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Ross: Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate,
huh? They loved it. 
Phoebe: Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
Rachel: And Mrs.?!
Rachel: What?!!
Phoebe: Just kidding!
Rachel: Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.) 
Phoebe: (To Ross) Saved your ass.
Chandler: Hey!
Phoebe: Hi.
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Well, you know that psychic I see?
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: What?!
Ross: (entering) Hey everyone!
Chandler: Oh hi!
Joey: (interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that
piece of paper?
Ross: No! Why?
Ross: (gets up) Okay!
Rachel: Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Ross: Thank you!
Rachel: Some uh, some visual aides.
Joey: Why not?!
Chandler: Hey.
Joey: Hey! Any good mail?
Chandler: (opens and reads it) "Benefits lapsed."
Joey: Let me see that!
Chandler: All right.
Chandler: Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
Rachel: Monica!
Monica: Hmm? (Rachel holds up the candlesticks.)
Rachel: Did-did you take these back?
Monica: No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some
for myself.
Monica: I loved them!
Rachel: Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)
Ross: (entering) Hello!
Monica: Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Estelle: Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think
they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
Estelle: Really?!
Joey: Yeah!
Estelle: Oh well, no harm, no foul.
Joey: Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
Estelle: All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Joey: Why?
Estelle: Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all
over town.
Joey: Bastard!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: What?!
Joey: Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was
using.) Damn you 15s!
Monica: What the hell are you doing?!
Ross: Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring!
I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British
accent just came out.
Rachel: Yeah, and not a very good one.
Ross: Will you-will you please?
Ross: Oh.
Ross: (in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica
aside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?
Ross: Just please stop!
Rachel: (in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Chandler: Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.)
Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Phoebe: Hey!
Chandler: Hey.
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: No! They are mine!
Monica: You stole them from me!
Rachel: You stole them from me!!
Monica: Gimme them!
Monica: You just wanna each take one?
Rachel: Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Ross: (entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to
speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Ross: Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Monica: I think you look fine.
Joey: Exactly.
Joey: Yeah, okay. (Leaves)
Joey: Yes!
Monica: Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Rachel: Really? Really?!
Monica: Yes!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Really?! How do you know?
Joey: (barely audible through the pain) Thank you.
Chandler: But are you sure you can do this?
Joey: Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me
take a shower.
Chandler: Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Joey: (to the director) Hiya!
Joey: Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my
pants. (Holds them both up.)
Alex: Okay.
Joey: Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right
up until you say action?
Joey: Okay. (Starts screaming.)
Joey: (he stops screaming at action) "Take good care of your Momma
son." (Again Alex does nothing.)
Rachel: (answering it) Hello? 
Ross: (in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out,
phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced
the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in
their carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One
student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)
Rachel: Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just
never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
Ross: (in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!
Phoebe: Have you really done this before?
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Hey-hey-hey!
Chandler: What are you doing?
Chandler: Oh, all right.
