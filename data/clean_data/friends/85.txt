Phoebe: (holding a lure) So now, what is this now?
Joey: Guggly worm.
Phoebe: (laughs and picks up another lure) And this?
Joey: Glow-pop giggly jammer.
Phoebe: (laughs harder) You make it so funny.
Joey: (examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the
sandwich)
All: Great!
Rachel: How does going to a strip club help him better?
Ross: Because there are naked ladies there.
Joey: Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Ross: There are naked ladies there too.
Joey: Yeah.
Chandler: (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would
you give me one minute!! Please.
Joshua: So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
Rachel: Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at
his ass.) There we go. There it is.
Joshua: (turning around) Oh! You know what I need? 
Rachel: Yeah!
Joshua: Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Joshua: Also large?
Rachel: Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Joshua: Okay.
Rachel: Yes.
Rachel: Sure. You got it. Great! 
Rachel: So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and
hoping for something more intimate.)
Joshua: Gloves?
Rachel: Oh.
Joshua: But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
Rachel: No! Nothing!
Rachel: Yeah! That would be great!
Rachel: Yeah, great, you betcha!
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Oh. Oh, right.
Rachel: Oh yay!
Joey: (entering) Hey-hey!
Ross: Hi!
Phoebe: Hey!
Ross: Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)
Joey: Oh my God, you guys have no idea. 
All: (they all recoil from the smell emanating from him) Oh! God! Wow!
Monica: You stink!
Ross: Are you kidding?!
Rachel: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hey, Monica!
Rachel: No! Help me!
Rachel: Phoebe?
Phoebe: I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening. 
Rachel: Ugh!
Phoebe: Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Rachel: Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!
Ross: Hi!
Ross: No.
Rachel: Ohhhh, come on!!!
Rachel: No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
Woman: Hello! (Monica screams)
Rachel: Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.)
Emily?
Emily: Yes.
Emily: Thank goodness.
Monica: I-I-I think you look great.
Emily: Good night, it was very nice to meet you all. (Storms out.)
Ross: Please hurry.
Phoebe: Ohh!
Monica: What?
Phoebe: It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
Monica: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Joey: (running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on
the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Monica: So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Why?
Rachel: The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got
there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Phoebe: Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
Monica: So you hit her in the face?
Phoebe: (going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs.
Chandler: They got a breakfast buffet.
Monica: Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!
Chandler: Ooh, let me talk to him!
Monica: Oh-oh, my God!
Monica: (to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?
Phoebe: What? Oh my God!
Chandler: Ow!
Monica: Why do you care so much anyway?
Monica: Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Monica: A couple of days.
Monica: Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Phoebe: Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Chandler: Okay. (Starts to cry)
Joey: Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
The A.D: You.
The A.D: You?
The A.D: What?
Joey: Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and
then ate some liquorice. 
Joey: Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
The A.D: The one with "Heston" on it.
Joey: Interesting.
Chandler: No thanks, Mom!
Phoebe: (doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Phoebe: Come on! Look where you are!!
Monica: (to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Phoebe: Remember, a virgin for me please.
Phoebe: Well, if you think it will help.
Phoebe: You should! How is she?
Chandler: Ohhh!!
Monica: I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Oh yeah, yeah.
Joey: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Monica: So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Chandler: Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress
there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Phoebe: Who, Josh?
Chandler: Yeah?
Phoebe: And do you know what girls are really good at?
Chandler: Stripping!
Monica: Come on! Chandler!
Phoebe: Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Monica: Oh, Candy! She was so spunky! 
Phoebe: Yeah.
Monica: Oh, Chantal!
Chandler: (jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Monica: Really?!
Chandler: I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Rachel: Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Phoebe: Oh! What is that? What is that?
Chandler: Come on, let me see that smile.
Chandler: Please?
Joey: I wanted to go to the strip club!
Joey: Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)
Monica: Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Oh, hey!
Ross: Hey! You were so right!
Rachel: What?
Ross: Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be
happy for each other. 
Rachel: Oh, hmm.
Rachel: Joshua.
Rachel: Oh, thank goodness!
Ross: Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
Ross: Happy for you. (He punches her back.)
Rachel: No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)
Phoebe: I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her.
Monica: Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Chandler: Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any
moment!
