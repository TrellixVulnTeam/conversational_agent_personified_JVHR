Chandler: We actually missed it.
Monica: This is insane!
Chandler: What?!
Phoebe: (shocked) Really?! 
Monica: Yeah!

groans.)
Ross: Why are we in bed together?
Ross: (checks) Yeah.
Rachel: Really?!
Rachel: Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Ross: (getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has
"Just Married" written on his back.)
Phoebe: What about my cab?
Phoebe: No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
Phoebe: Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Joey: Sure?

Chandler: Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Chandler: Monica and I almost got married last night.
Chandler: What?!
Monica: Yes I do!
Phoebe: Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Chandler: (returning with Joey) Hi.
Phoebe: No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. 
Ross: Hey!
The Girls: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: What?
Ross: Yeah!
Phoebe: Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Rachel: (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)
Chandler: (not quite sure) You did.
Rachel: Oh my God.
Rachel: No!
Monica: What are you guys gonna do?
Rachel: Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)
Ross: What?
All: Oh yeah!
Monica: So, what do you think we should do?
Monica: I know I love you! (They hug.)
Chandler: So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have
all the marriages thing? I love you.
Chandler: Sounds great.
Monica: Okay. (They approach the craps table.)
Croupler: Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Monica: Ready?
Chandler: Ready!
Monica: (sarcastic) Come on eight.
Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, yes eight.
Monica: I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?
Joey: (wakes up) What?!
Joey: All right. All right.
Phoebe: Sing!!
Joey: (starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)
Joey: (to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens
his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hey, hubby!
Ross: Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole
annulment thing?
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Ross: Yes, exactly!
Rachel: And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Rachel: You are asking me to be your wife!
Ross: And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Monica: That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Chandler: Well you did pull his hair.
Monica: He took my snack!
Chandler: No!
Monica: Okay.
Phoebe: Do you like car games?
Phoebe: I love the license plate game!
Phoebe: No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the
partition.) 
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Ross: Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make
you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get to
keep all the presents!
Rachel: (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I
thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay
married.
Rachel: Oh b-b-but it is!
Rachel: Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any
such thing as an annulment shower?
Phoebe: Oh, okay.
Phoebe: You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Phoebe: Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
Joey: Yes.
Phoebe: Is it a meatball sub?
Joey: That is incredible! You are the master!
Rachel: All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)
Chandler: Me too!
Chandler: No!
Monica: Then all your stuff would be here.
Chandler: Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Monica: Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Chandler: Me asking is kind of a sign.
Monica: YES!!!!!!!!
Chandler: Okay!!!!!
Monica: Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Oh thanks.
Monica: Ready!
Chandler: This is not a sign!
Chandler: I love you!
Monica: I love you!
Chandler: Are you hugging the door right now.
Monica: No.
Chandler: Yeah-yeah, me neither.
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Rachel: Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Ross: Oh yeah, why not?
Rachel: Pheebs?
Ross: Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Phoebe: Always.
Phoebe: What?!
Joey: What are you doing?
Joey: I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment)
Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)
Chandler: Oh.
