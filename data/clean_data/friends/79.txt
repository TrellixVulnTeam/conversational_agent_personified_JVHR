Joey: (answering phone) Hello.
Joey: (answering phone) Hello.
Voice: (on phone) Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily
challenge.
Joey: All right!
Chandler: (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Rachel: So are things with you and Joey any better?
Rachel: Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those
plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Ross: Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen
from your office?
Phoebe: I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Chandler: Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Phoebe: Ohh.
Monica: Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Monica: Who cares? He works in a museum!
Chandler: Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Chandler: Thanks.
Monica: What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and
a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!
Phoebe: God, what happened?!
Monica: Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
Rachel: (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!
Chandler: Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Phoebe: Open it up, let me see.
Chandler: Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Phoebe: Ooh, God it looks bad.
Rachel: Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
Monica: Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.
Monica: Yes!!
Ross: Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Phoebe: Okay, get out of my kitchen!
Chandler: (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with
Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed
the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
Ross: Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Chandler: Like?
Ross: Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
Chandler: When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Chandler: Big dog?
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Ross: What are you doing?
Ross: Everything? Even the TV?
Joey: Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would
you hear him out?
Joey: Five years. 
Ross: Oh, who? Me?
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: What?
Kathy: Oh my God, is it really that bad?
Joey: (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Gunther: I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over
there.
Kathy: Oh.
Chandler: Hey Joe.
Joey: (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)
Monica: Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Nurse: Dr. Burke will see you know.
Monica: Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call
doctor will see me now.
Nurse: Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see
you now.
Joey: My folks.
Chandler: Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Joey: When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit
for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about
how I let you down! 
Chandler: What?
Chandler: All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be
something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in
it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?
Tim: Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were
just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
Monica: I was probably waiting for it to open.
Tim: I gotta tell you, you look great now.
Monica: You look great too.
Monica: So how does it look?
Monica: Like a pirate?!
Tim: If that helps you. 
Monica: Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her)
Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Tim: I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Monica: Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Tim: Uh. (He holds up a brown lunch bag.)
Monica: No way!
Monica: (disappointed) Oh.
Tim: But we broke up.
Monica: (happy) Oh. 
Monica: I know.
Monica: Why is it sick?
Ross: Yeah.
Joey: Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Chandler: (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad
idea to me.
Rachel: Is he okay in there?
Rachel: So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Joey: Chandler?
Chandler: The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through
the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another
finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a
third finger), it hurts!
Ross: (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last
year? Can I see it?
Rachel: (worried) Why?
Ross: I just wanna check something.
Rachel: Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)
Chandler: Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)
Rachel: (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I
wear it all the time.
Ross: (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is
silver.
Rachel: Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. 
Ross: Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Ross: What did you get?
Rachel: Credit. 
Tim: Hi. (gives her a bottle of wine)
Monica: Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe. 
Tim: Hi, nice to meet you.
Monica: And Joey.
Joey: Hey!
Tim: Hi, Joey.
Monica: My brother, Ross.
Ross: Hey.
Chandler: How do ya do.
Chandler: What happened? What happened?!
Joey: You kissed my girlfriend!
Rachel: Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
Monica: All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Tim: Where can I wash up?
Monica: Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink,
and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Tim: Thank you.
Tim: Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
Monica: I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)
Rachel: (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.
Chandler: Gotcha! (laughs)
Chandler: Sorry!
Chandler: Okay, okay, you got it!
Rachel: Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Rachel: Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Rachel: Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)
Joey: So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Chandler: Absolutely!
Monica: (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)
Tim: Here, let me help. (Does so.)
Monica: Thank you.
Tim: Oh, I totally agree.
Tim: What?
Monica: Nothing. Nothing.
Tim: No-no really, was-was that not okay?
Monica: Yeah!
Tim: Oh man!!
Monica: I know!
Joey: Hey.
Joey: In the box.
Kathy: (going over to the box) Chandler?
Kathy: By being in a box?
Rachel: Joey, had reasons. 
Phoebe: They were threefold.
Joey: (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)
Rachel: What?!
Joey: He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get
out of there!
Chandler: So?
Chandler: Yeah?
Rachel: Oh, he sees her!
Phoebe: Oh, there they are!
Phoebe: All right, get a room.
