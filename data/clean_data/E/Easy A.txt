EASY "A": Written by Bert V. Royal
FIRST DRAFT: August 3, 2008
OLIVE: Let the record show that I, Olive Penderghast, being of sound mind, ample breast size and the occasional corny knock knock joke, do enter this video blog into evidence in the case against me. Because I'm being judged by a jury of my peers, I will attempt to insert `like' and `totally' into my confession as much as possible. So here it goes. I confess I'm, in no small part, to blame for the vociferous gossip that has turned my Varsity letter scarlet, but - for anyone hoping that the sizzling details of my sordid past will provide you with a reason to lock the door and make love to a dollop of your sister's moisturizing lotion - you'll be gravely ( Beat. ) Look, I just need to set the record straight and what better way to do that, than to broadcast it on the Internet. So, here it is Part One: The Shudder-Inducing and Cliched, However Totally False Account Of How I Lost My Virginity To A Guy At A Community College In A Neighboring Town. ( Beat. ) Let me just begin by saying that there are two sides to every story. This is my side, the right one. ( Beat. ) Like, totally.
RHIANNON: Fuck off! George is not a `sexy' name. George is like what you name your teddy bear, not the name you wanna scream out during an orgasm.
OLIVE: That's bullshit. There are lots of sexy Georges.
RHIANNON: Name three. Olive starts to say something, but Rhiannon interrupts her.
OLIVE: Shouldn't that alone be enough?
RHIANNON: Fine. That's one. Number two?
OLIVE: ( THINKING )
RHIANNON: Who's that?
OLIVE: Superman. From way back. He was No way. Teddy bear.
RHIANNON: No way. Teddy bear.
OLIVE: Bullshit. Ben Affleck played him in that movie!
RHIANNON: So what? Charlize Theron played that butt-fucking-ugly lesbo serial killer. Besides he's from another We're speaking present day. I mean, Jesus, Mortimer was probably a sexy name in some era.
OLIVE: George Stephanopolous.
RHIANNON: What are you? Fifty?
OLIVE: ( THINKING HARD )
RHIANNON: Bush? Yeah. He's one hot mutherfucker. Just face it. There's no such thing as a sexy Well, mine is. So, I think we should just put this conversation to bed.
OLIVE: Well, mine is. So, I think we should just put this conversation to bed.
RHIANNON: Fine. Don't come. I hate you. Rhiannon folds her arms and pouts.
OLIVE: Let me back up. I don't know if any of you have ever met them, but Rhiannon's parents are quite possibly the creepiest people in a four county radius.
RHIANNON: ( Into the phone ) PLEASE. Please. I'm begging you. I'll pay you.
OLIVE: Rhi, I can't. I told you I have You're lying. You're a lying bitch and I hate you so much right now.
RHIANNON: You're lying. You're a lying bitch and I hate you so much right now.
OLIVE: ( LYING )
MR. ABERNATHY: Would you like a marshmallow, Olive Mrs. Abernathy squeaks out a meek titter that is annoyingly MRS. ABERNATHY Olive oil. That's funny. Very, very funny.
MRS. ABERNATHY: Olive oil. That's funny. Very, very funny.
OLIVE: ( POLITELY )
MR. ABERNATHY: You can call me Mortimer, Olive Mrs. Abernathy titters again. Rhiannon rolls her eyes. There is another awkwardly long silence, while the Abernathys grin away at their fire.
RHIANNON: ( Into the phone ) Why don't you just say it? You don't like my parents. You think they're hopelessly pathetic and devoid of souls and wish that you could live with normal people who didn't meet at a Star Trek She quickly catches her faux pas and stops talking.
OLIVE: ( Sympathetic to her
FRIEND ): Rhi, I like your parents. They're sweet. But I can't go camping this Quick. Hurry and make up a lie.
RHIANNON: Quick. Hurry and make up a lie.
OLIVE: I have a date.
RHIANNON: ( LYING )
OLIVE: ( LYING )
RHIANNON: With who?
OLIVE: You don't know him.
RHIANNON: And neither do you, you selfish I'm serious. He goes to the community college with my brother in Denton.
OLIVE: I'm serious. He goes to the community college with my brother in Denton.
RHIANNON: What's his name then?
OLIVE: ( WAXING CUTE )
RHIANNON: Stop stalling. You're totally trying to come up with a name. Just say it.
OLIVE: I'm not proud of this. Less about the lie and more about the unoriginality of it. Okay, have you guys ever watched `The Brady Bunch'? Of course you haven't. You're busy watching fake people pretend to be real on MTV. That's why I knew I could get away with it. See, there was this episode where Jan - the awkward middle child - made up a boyfriend to assuage the ridicule of her snatchy sister who had just stolen the heart of the boy that Jan loved. The name of her imaginary boyfriend
WAS: INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DAY
OLIVE: ( Into the phone ) George Glass.
RHIANNON: George? What kind of a fucking name is George?
OLIVE: He's pretty hot and he asked me out this weekend, so I said yes. Although still skeptical, she seems a tad more mollified.
RHIANNON: If you're choosing him over helping me cope with two days in the wilderness with these people who even I'm not convinced aren't serial killers, he had better be the one. You had better fucking marry him, have fucking babies with him and then take him for fucking everything he's worth.
OLIVE: INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS Rhi and Olive continue their conversation, as Rhi pops a tater tot into her mouth.
RHIANNON: ( With her mouth full ) You're not off the hook, you know. I want lurid details. This had better be the best date of your life to counterbalance the worst weekend of mine.
OLIVE: I'm sure you'll have a good time.
OLIVE: ( Through the proverbial

EVERYTHING: that can possibly mean
OLIVE WHATNOTS: and olive trees! Olive trees? What a quaint notion. Olive trees.
OLIVE: But on Monday, when Rhi asked me how my weekend was.
OLIVE: It was nothing short of perfection.
RHIANNON: Details, bitch. Wait, first I need a scope of reference. Who would play him in the movie of your life?
OLIVE: Ryan Gosling, definitely.
RHIANNON: That works. Spill.
OLIVE: He was charming. A real gentleman.
RHIANNON: Are you going to see him again?
OLIVE: Probably not. It was just one of those weekends.
RHIANNON: The whole weekend?
OLIVE: Rhiannon suddenly stops and twirls Olive to face her.
RHIANNON: Wait a minute. You didn't.
OLIVE: No, of course not.
RHIANNON: ( VERY LOUDLY )
OLIVE: I did not.
RHIANNON: YES YOU DID, YOU LYING FUCKING Olive grabs her and drags her forward, interrupting the show.
WHORE!: Olive grabs her and drags her forward, interrupting the show.
ME!: I'm not that kind of girl.
OLIVE: I'm not that kind of girl.
RHIANNON: The kind that does it or the kind that does it like a fucking porn star and then doesn't have the balls to talk about it? Rhi drags her into the
RHIANNON: I want every perverted detail. NOW, bitch. Pressured, Olive lies.
OLIVE: Okay. Fine. We did it.
RHIANNON: You lost your virginity! Fucking finally! Now, you're a super-slut like me!
OLIVE: Rhi. Blowing Peter Tolliver once behind the Pizza Hut doesn't make you a super-slut.
RHIANNON: There were people walking past. Whatever, this isn't about me. This is about YOU. What did you let him do?
RHIANNON: Was he big? Did it hurt?
OLIVE: No. It was great. Like I said. Okay, that's enough. The toilet flushes and MARIANNE BRYANT ( 16 ), an Aryanesque, cardigan-wearing Christian-girl exits from a stall and walks to the sink, where she vigorously washes her hands - while staring at Rhi and Olive with disgust.
RHIANNON: What the fuck are you looking at, Nothing. Just a couple of admitted Marianne wipes her hands and leaves the restroom. Olive's stomach revolves at her now-turned-public admission.
MARIANNE: Nothing. Just a couple of admitted Marianne wipes her hands and leaves the restroom. Olive's stomach revolves at her now-turned-public admission.
OLIVE: So, how was your weekend? ( I promise it's the last time. )
MR. ABERNATHY: Wienie, Rhi? Rhi snorts in contempt of her father and his wienie.
OLIVE: Marianne Bryant, as we all know, is the President of the Christian Student Coalition and is that rare breed of human born with a stick the size of a baseball bat implanted up her anus. God's honest. I'm sure it's in some medical dictionary somewhere.
MASCOT: Blue Devils! Blue Devils! Blue The crowd goes wild.
CONTINUOUS: Marianne, melodramatically, grabs a PASSING STUDENT by the The scared student takes her pamphlet and runs away.
MARIANNE: How can we exhibit school pride when we're conveyed to others as satan worshippers? The scared student takes her pamphlet and runs away.
MASCOT: Go meerkats! Go meerkats! He can't seem to get himself or the student body as excited - with the exception of Marianne and Nina, in the stands applauding proudly. The school band is playing `GOLDFINGER.' Across the gym, Olive sits with Rhiannon.
RHIANNON: What the fuck is a meerkat anyway?
OLIVE: Beats the hell out of me. But can we just take a moment to applaud the Barbara Bush High School Marching Band for their very ambitious effort to learn all of the James Bond theme music in a single year? I personally wish them all the best in their endeavor. Ku-dos!
RHIANNON: I think I speak for all of the female students and faculty - and maybe a couple of males - when I say that I liked Todd much better when he was shirtless. I actually looked forward to these disturbing displays of what do they call School spirit.
OLIVE: School spirit.
RHIANNON: Yeah. That's it.
OLIVE: Even dressed as a meerkat, I still fantasize about him.
RHIANNON: Ha! What are those people called again? The ones that dress up like stuffed animals when they do it?
OLIVE: Rhiannon laughs.
RHIANNON: Shhh. Don't let Marianne hear you say that word. The last thing we need is McCarthyism at Barbara Isn't high school already a hotbed of just that?
OLIVE: Isn't high school already a hotbed of just that?
RHIANNON: ( Beat. ) Yeah, I'd totally fuck Meerkat They both get lost in the thought.
OLIVE: So, of course, immediately I knew that the little white lie I told to my then-best-friend in the ladies room would come back to bite me on the ass. However, even I - who my fourth grade teacher stated on my report card `has an imagination that should be quickly expunged' - had no idea how quickly this article of fiction would spread. So, now we move on to Part Two: The Accelerated Velocity of Terminological Inexactitude.
OLIVE: Hey Marianne, can I talk to you for a second? Nina, reluctantly, gives them a moment alone.
MARIANNE: ( EXASPERATED )
OLIVE: Listen, what you heard in the bathroom, that wasn't true. It's actually a funny story. Do you ever watch `The Brady Bunch'?
MARIANNE: Olive - that's your name, right? Olive knows that Marianne knows her name, but obligingly I'm not the one you have to answer to for your depraved behavior. There is a higher power to judge your indecency.
OLIVE: ( JOKINGLY )
MARIANNE: ( ICILY )
OLIVE: Oh, I have sixteen years worth of anecdotal proof that He does. Olive looks over and sees that Nina is talking to a group of GUYS, who are looking at Olive, intrigued.
MARIANNE: Look. You've made your bed. I just hope for your sake, you cleaned the sheets. She turns on her heels and leaves Olive behind.
OLIVE: ( TO HERSELF )
OLIVE: I'm swell, guy-I've-never-laid-eyes- on-before. Thanks for asking.
OLIVE: Hey, you guys know that I was here all weekend, right?
DILL: ( SLIGHTLY CONCERNED )
OLIVE: It's nothing. Just the rumor mill.
ROSEMARY: What's the rumor mill turning out these days?
OLIVE: Seriously, it's nothing. They continue to eat.
ROSEMARY: Don't forget your brother's staying here next weekend.
OLIVE: Why? He never comes home.
ROSEMARY: They're fumigating the dorms. And thank God for that. Last time I was there, I saw three cockroaches.
GINGER: ( WHINY )
ROSEMARY: Sorry, hon.
OLIVE: Like all families, mine has a deep dark secret. And since I'm spilling all this dirt, I might as well go ahead and confess it. She takes a deep breath.
OLIVE: If I'd known that Meerkat Todd was going to turn out so hot, I probably would have cherished the moment more. I suppose just that I'm sitting here reminiscing about it means that it must have meant ( Beat. ) Yeah, so anyway - kissing's not really my thing. That's what I learned in Natalie Giblin's closet. I digress.
SCARLET LETTER.': OLIVE ( V.O. ) So, I'm feeling like the cat's ass, because everyone thinks I've been deflowered. I'm surprised at how empowered I felt by this prevarication. I wonder to myself, would I feel this invigorated if I had actually let some college kid violate me in his cockroach- infested dorm room? Probably not. ( Beat. ) Ironically, we were studying `The Scarlet Letter,' but isn't that always the way with these teenage tales? The literature you read in class always seems to have a strong connection with whatever angsty adolescent drama is being recounted. I consider this. ( Pause. ) Then I think: Except for `Huckleberry Finn.' I don't know any teenage boys who have ever run away with a big, hulking black guy.
MR. GRIFFIN: Alright, so thoughts? Nina raises her hand. Mr. Griffin points to her.
NINA: I think Hester Prynne was - excuse my language - a whore.
MR. GRIFFIN: You don't see her as a victim?
NINA: Why should I? She brought it on Nina whips around and gives Olive a look, surprising her.
OLIVE: Excuse me?
NINA: Perhaps you should embroider a red A on your wardrobe?
OLIVE: Perhaps you should GET a wardrobe, you twat! The class bursts into surprised laughter. Even Mr. Griffin tries hard to suppress a congratulatory glance in her OLIVE ( V.O. ) ( CONT'D ) Admittedly, not my best line. But it was provocative enough to land me in the Principal's office. Mr. Griffin, begrudgingly, calls her to his desk. He starts writing something on a piece of paper.
FINALLY: Seems as if someone's on a downward Seems as if someone's practicing the mundane activities she'll be saddled with the rest of her pathetic life.
MARIANNE: Seems as if someone's on a downward Seems as if someone's practicing the mundane activities she'll be saddled with the rest of her pathetic life.
OLIVE: Seems as if someone's practicing the mundane activities she'll be saddled with the rest of her pathetic life.
MARIANNE: You have a chip on your shoulder the size of Texas.
OLIVE: Wow, that's even bigger than your You're going to hell.
MARIANNE: ( COLDLY )
OLIVE: ( Growing weary of this
BANTER ): As long as you won't be there.
MARIANNE: Oh, I can assure you I won't. Neither says anything for a few moments.
OLIVE: Why? Your parents didn't.
MARIANNE: You know, you're just like The principal's door opens and Marianne quickly shuts up and continues her work. TWO KIDS emerge. One, obviously, a bully; the other, obviously, the bullied. The BULLIED kid is holding a BLOODIED TISSUE up to his nose. He and Olive exchange meaningful glances. PRINCIPAL GIBBONS ( 60's ), a colossal prick disguised as a man, gestures for her to come in. Olive gets up and enters
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: I don't know you. She thrusts her hand out.
OLIVE: Olive Penderghast. He eyes her hand, not amused, and she quickly withdraws it.
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: Why are we just now meeting? Using language like this should have warranted a visit to me years ago.
OLIVE: Well, to be perfectly honest - I've never used an epithet like this in an educational arena before. Sir.
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: This is foul.
OLIVE: In my defense, I think I meant to say `twit.' It just came out more - what's the word I'm looking for? A young lady with such an extensive vocabulary shouldn't be stooping to such vituperations.
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: A young lady with such an extensive vocabulary shouldn't be stooping to such vituperations.
OLIVE: ( SMILING )
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: Wipe that smile off your face ( Consulting the note ) Olive. I don't tolerate this kind of language. Ever. Consider this your first warning. If I find out you've used a word like this in my school again, I will make sure that it's your last. I don't operate on a `three strikes you're out system'. You get one warning from She starts to say something
OLIVE: I always do. Are we finished? He gestures to the door.
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: Detention tomorrow after school in Room 704. And, young lady, I don't want to see you again.
OLIVE: Not even in a more positive capacity? Maybe I could win a ribbon or a medal or something. I could conceivably be valedictorian. Or something.
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: ( FRIGHTENINGLY SERIOUS )
RHIANNON: Please tell me the rumors are true.
OLIVE: Yes, I'm a big whore.
RHIANNON: Not that one. The one where you called Nina Howell a cunt and then socked her in the nose.
OLIVE: It's not entirely true. ( Beat. ) Look, there's something I need to tell you. Rhiannon ignores her sincere attempt to confess.
RHIANNON: Yeah. Like the exact moment you turned into such a BAD ASS? I think I'm in LOVE with you.
OLIVE: ( FRUSTRATED ) OLIVE ( CONT'D )
RHIANNON: Please. It's my only perk. Trust They get into her car.
OLIVE: I got sent to the Principal today. Her parents seem more impressed than upset. This is definitely a first.
DILL: What did you do?
OLIVE: I used inappropriate language in English class. But we're reading a book that I, personally, deem wildly inappropriate for my age group, so I felt that it was actually quite apropos.
ROSEMARY: ( More curious than angry ) What did you say? Olive looks to her little sister and thinks better of saying the word out loud.
OLIVE: Let's just say it was an inappropriate word.
DILL: What did it start with?
OLIVE: A snide comment from a snotty-ass girl in my class.
DILL: I meant what letter did it start Oh. Yeah. T.
OLIVE: Oh. Yeah. T.
ROSEMARY: T? That's an odd one. Is this one of those new curse words? Both her parents wheels are going. They're both seeking the answer in their heads, but are coming up with nothing.
OLIVE: I don't even know what that means.
ROSEMARY: Yeah. Neither do I. Her parents search their brains, but nothing is coming to Okay. Noun, adjective or verb?
DILL: Okay. Noun, adjective or verb?
OLIVE: Noun. Definitely slang. Think British, although they pronounce it Well, I'm stumped. Whisper it in my ear.
ROSEMARY: Well, I'm stumped. Whisper it in my ear.
OLIVE: I can't. Too weird. Excited by the prospect
ROSEMARY: Oo! Oo! Spell it with your peas!
OLIVE: Now, THAT'S a challenge. She begins maneuvering her peas around the plate.
DILL: Does this have something to do with this rumor you were talking about the other night? Olive touches her index finger to her nose, as she continues to manipulate her food.
OLIVE: I'm spelling it out for you as quickly as I can.
GINGER: ( Desperate for attention ) I got a B plus on my spelling test Too intrigued by Olive's admission to really care
ROSEMARY: Good, sweetheart. Rosemary figures it out as Olive is assembling the A.
GINGER: ( Glancing at Olive's
PLATE ): What's a twat? Olive quickly scrapes the peas into a pile.
DILL: It's a word that will get you sent to the principal's office.
ROSEMARY: ( Whispering into Ginger's
EAR ): It's not a good word.
OLIVE: The male equivalent.
ROSEMARY: Of what? Now, it's Dill's turn to whisper in Rosemary's ear. She nods in understanding.
DILL: Well, it's the first time since second grade, so I guess we can't be too hard on you.
OLIVE: ( GENUINELY CURIOUS )
DILL: I dunno. To bed without supper?
OLIVE: But I'm already finished. Except for my helpful and profane peas.
DILL: ( THINKING HARD )
OLIVE: I'll help you out. I don't have anyone to call. I haven't watched TV since they cancelled `The Illegitimate Children of the Real Housewives of Laguna Beach' and I really only watched that as a joke.
DILL: Fine. I'd take away your
OLIVE: Books? Computer?
DILL: Yes! You're computer!
OLIVE: All my homework's on there. Sorry. You lose. But thanks for playing.
DILL: ( SMILING WARMLY )
OLIVE: I think we both are. I wouldn't know how to be grounded any more than you know how to ground.
DILL: I love you. ( Whispering in her ear ) And I'm sure that girl was acting like exactly what you called her.
OLIVE: ( WHISPERING BACK )
GINGER: How come you guys never get mad at Because, pumpkin, of our three darling children, we love her best. ( Erupting into laughter ) Just kidding! Now eat your dinner. Dill chuckles, but Ginger is not amused.
ROSEMARY: Because, pumpkin, of our three darling children, we love her best. ( Erupting into laughter ) Just kidding! Now eat your dinner. Dill chuckles, but Ginger is not amused.
OLIVE: The next day, things took a turn for the scandalous. Which brings us to Part Three: A Lady's Choice and a Gentleman's Agreement. She smiles slyly into her camera.
OLIVE: Are these detention sessions often I don't think we pose a flight I see. Olive laughs to herself.
BULLIED KID: I don't think we pose a flight I see. Olive laughs to herself.
OLIVE: I see. Olive laughs to herself.
BULLIED KID: I was just thinking it's kind of funny. We haven't really talked since that closet incident back in eighth grade.
OLIVE: I was just thinking it's kind of funny. We haven't really talked since that closet incident back in eighth grade.
BULLIED KID: I was afraid you were going to bring that up.
OLIVE: So, how have you been, Brandon?
BRANDON: ( DRYLY )
OLIVE: Yeah, only two days after the custodians had finally gotten around to scrubbing `turd burglar' off. Which, if you think about it, really contradicts the previous Maybe your vandal is marvelling at your versatility? Brandon shoots her a `that's not funny' look.
BRANDON: Yeah, only two days after the custodians had finally gotten around to scrubbing `turd burglar' off. Which, if you think about it, really contradicts the previous Maybe your vandal is marvelling at your versatility? Brandon shoots her a `that's not funny' look.
OLIVE: Maybe your vandal is marvelling at your versatility? Brandon shoots her a `that's not funny' look.
BRANDON: But, of course, I'm in detention.
OLIVE: Because Gibbons is a homophobe. ( Beat. ) And I called him a facist.
BRANDON: Because Gibbons is a homophobe. ( Beat. ) And I called him a facist.
OLIVE: So, the rumors are true, huh?
BRANDON: ( INCREDULOUS )
OLIVE: No. I meant about Gibbons being a He laughs.
BRANDON: Gold star for you, Nancy Drew. There's a brief silence between them.
OLIVE: You know, I read this article that said with this whole EMO movement, it looks like - that in a few years - the gay kids are going to be the most popular ones in school.
BRANDON: Oh good. I'll come back when I'm twenty seven for my redo. Ignoring his cynicism
OLIVE: Can you imagine the dance squad full of shirtless guys in tight pants rocking out to Britney, while the football players sit on the sidelines wishing they were that That'll be the day. ( Beat. ) Judging from the new look you're sporting, I'm not the only one in a transformative stage. `Sup with the whore couture?
BRANDON: That'll be the day. ( Beat. ) Judging from the new look you're sporting, I'm not the only one in a transformative stage. `Sup with the whore couture?
OLIVE: ( PROUDLY )
BRANDON: As a matter of fact I did hear that. I heard you banged a guy twice your age.
OLIVE: No way. He's a freshman in Also heard he gave you crabs.
BRANDON: Also heard he gave you crabs.
OLIVE: Ewwww. People suck.
BRANDON: Tell me about it.
OLIVE: He's not real. The guy I slept with. I made him up.
BRANDON: So, you started the rumor?
OLIVE: Indirectly? Sort of. Well, not really. No. No, I didn't.
BRANDON: But you're perpetuating it. That's fucked up.
OLIVE: ( OFFENDED )
BRANDON: It's true. There's only one thing worse than these tabloid-chasing celebutantes with their vapid minds and their immoral souls and that's the people who want to be like Did I say I wanted to be like them?
OLIVE: Did I say I wanted to be like them?
BRANDON: No, you just want everyone else to think you are.
OLIVE: Why does it matter if it's not who I really am? No offense, Brando, but maybe you could learn something from me.
BRANDON: You're saying I should pretend to be straight, so people will like me? What a novel idea. You should do seminars. Oh, wait a minute, I forgot. In high school,
THEY'RE NOT!: Calm down, Adolph. There's a vein popping out of your neck. I'm simply suggesting that maybe these kids we call peers have got the right idea. Maybe Bridget Schumacher isn't as hippy-dippy as she pretends to be. Maybe that's just the label she's put on herself to avoid having to bathe as often as society deems necessary. Or take Marianne Bryant. It's convenient for her to act like a stuck-up Jesus-freak. ( Thinking about this ) No. I'm wrong. I think she's actually just a stuck-up Jesus- freak. But do you think she cares that that's the way she's perceived? No. Maybe she was just sick of being just another nameless, faceless entity in a place and a time that reveres people for extremity? Brandon realizes why she's chosen this path and feels for There are some of us, though, that want to just blend in to the crowd.

BRANDON: There are some of us, though, that want to just blend in to the crowd.
OLIVE: Then maybe you need to go to that extreme. Or make the steadfast decision not to care. Even better if you can manage to do both. ( Beat. ) I've discovered an infallible remedy for teen angst: apathy.
BRANDON: I can't decide if you're a genius or a lunatic.
OLIVE: Don't they sort of go hand-in-hand? She smiles sinisterly at him.
BRANDON: Funny. I always thought teen angst and apathy went hand in hand.
OLIVE: How am I doing?
BRANDON: What? Pretending to be a whore? For a virgin, I'm impressed. How about me? Could I pass as Not bad. For a fag.
OLIVE: Not bad. For a fag.
BRANDON: I prefer the term `turd burglar.' They both break character and return to being themselves.
OLIVE: If we really wanted to shock the world, we'd get up and leave But you know that we would never do Isn't going to stop me from telling everybody we did. Brandon thinks hard about everything that's just been said. His brain is going a-mile-a-minute. In that noggin, an idea has been planted. Olive, not oblivious to this, returns to her novel.

OLIVE: Well, I guess that's better than me getting crabs from a guy twice my RHIANNON ( O.S. ) Ewww. Who said that?
OLIVE: You know that Brandon kid?
OLIVE: The one and only. It's what somebody told him.
OLIVE: Isn't that sad? He's actually quite the conversationalist.
OLIVE: Since when are straight guys under the age of eighteen able to A call beeps in on the other line.
OLIVE: ( SINGSONG )
BRANDON: It's Brandon.
OLIVE: Speak of the devil.
OLIVE: ( INTRIGUED )
OLIVE: Dude, that was Brandon. He wants to talk to me about something.
OLIVE: That's so mean.
OLIVE: Rhi, I told you. It was a one night stand. Which is now a DONE night stand.
OLIVE: If I was a character on a CW show, then, absolutely, I'd be blubbering all over my Teen Vogue. Hey, we should start a rumor that I'm having a pregnancy scare! Olive is stoked by her idea.
BRANDON: Hi. Is there an Olive here?
ROSEMARY: ( FEIGNING CONFUSION )
BRANDON: Sorry, I must have gotten the address wrong.
ROSEMARY: Just kidding! Come on in. Brandon walks in and Rosemary shouts
OLIVE: Oh happy day, Mama! I thought I was going to have to spend my dowry on booze and pills to numb the Olive grabs Brandon by the hand and leads him upstairs to
OLIVE: My mom's an acquired taste. I know this because I've only just recently begun to appreciate her She gestures for him to sit down.
BRANDON: ( BLURTING OUT )
OLIVE: Brandon, just a few hours ago, you told me you were Kinsey Six gay.
BRANDON: True. But you said I should pretend to be straight.
OLIVE: Well, I didn't mean with me. You're a sweet guy and all, but you're not really my type.
BRANDON: You're not really my type either.
OLIVE: I should say not.
BRANDON: Okay. Well, do you wanna have sex with me?
OLIVE: You're serious. He nervously nods.
BRANDON: No, I know what you were saying. I should play it straight until I get out of this hell and then I can be whoever I want to be. No, I got Brandon, I didn't REALLY have sex with a college guy. I just told people I did.
OLIVE: Brandon, I didn't REALLY have sex with a college guy. I just told people I did.
BRANDON: So, you're saying I shouldn't really have sex. I should just say I had sex with someone. A girl.
OLIVE: Now, you're cooking with gas. It's his turn to smile slyly at her. She sees where he's going with this and instantly gets defensive.
BRANDON: Think about it. We could help each other out. You want to maintain this floozy facade. I want to not get my face pummelled weekly.
OLIVE: You are on crack.
BRANDON: All it would take is one good imaginary fuck and you'd be saving the bone structure of my face. Think of how happy my parents would This is not the answer. Why don't you just do what I did and make someone up?
OLIVE: This is not the answer. Why don't you just do what I did and make someone up?
BRANDON: Who would believe me?
DESPERATE ): Listen, Olive, I don't want to do this. I want to live in that not- too-distant EMO world, but I still have another year of this bullshit place and I can't do it. I just can't do it. ( Beat. )
OLIVE: ( GENTLY )
BRANDON: Whores aren't discerning, Olive. And just think - you'll OFFICIALLY be a hooker with a heart of gold!
OLIVE: I don't want your money.
BRANDON: I insist.
OLIVE: So, if I say yes, you're going to tell a couple of people at school and I just have to go with it? I really don't think it will work.
BRANDON: ( His voice cracking with
EMOTION ): I can make it work. I promise. She sees tears forming in his eyes. She walks away from him and is silent for a long few moments.
OLIVE: I don't do anything half-assed. ( Spinning around to face
HIM ): It'll have to be a public event. Melanie Bostic is having a party tomorrow night. All of your tormentors will be there. You and I are going together. You have to do everything I say AND you have to tell people that I was sensational. Brandon wipes his tears away and is the happiest gay you've ever seen. He throws his arms around her and won't let go.
BRANDON: I can't believe you're doing this.
OLIVE: Afterwards, it's up to you. You're committing to something.
OLIVE: I'm sure you all remember the INT. BOSTIC HOUSE - NIGHT A TEEN PARTY rages. DRUNK KIDS abound. Olive, looking like a million-fuckin'-bucks, prances into the party with Brandon, who's looking pretty snazzy himself. They appear drunk and are falling all over each other. People stare in complete amazement at a. ) Their appearance and b. ) That they're even together in the first place. You'd never guess that this was anything less than an A-LIST TEEN COUPLE, ripped from the pages of Teen People. Olive falls against Brandon laughing. He hoists her up, as their host, MELANIE BOSTIC ( 17 ), a fairly pretty girl, Hey Olive!
MELANIE: Hey Olive!
OLIVE: OhmiGod, Melly. I hope you don't mind, but we had a few pre-cocktail party cocktails.
MELANIE: Well, glad you could make it.
OLIVE: ( Whispering and slurring in her ear ) Soooo, here's the thing.
MELANIE: Sure. You can use the guest room. Down the hall.
OLIVE: I love you. I love you so much. You are Just, yeah. She gives her a drunken punch on the shoulder. She spins around to the entire party, who is looking at them with complete interest.
MELANIE: ( Shocked; Mouthing to a
GUEST ): What the fuck?! The bully who emerged from Gibbons's office with Brandon, goes up to Melanie.
BULLY: Was that Olive with Brandon?
MELANIE: I know! Right? They, with a big group, race down the hall where Brandon and Olive have just retreated to.
OLIVE: ( WHISPERING )
BRANDON: ( WHISPERING )
OLIVE: ( WHISPERING )
BRANDON: ( WHISPERING )
OLIVE: ( WHISPERING STERNLY )
OLIVE: Hold on. She unbuttons Brandon's shirt and rebuttons it incorrectly.
BRANDON: Thanks Olive. He kisses her on the cheek and she smiles.
OLIVE: Is there a ?
MELANIE: Back entrance is through the She begins her walk of shame down the corridor into the

MEERKAT TODD: ( POLITELY )
OLIVE: Hi Todd. Obviously oblivious to the demonstration that just occurred
MEERKAT TODD: How's it going?
OLIVE: ( She doesn't know how she
I'M: ( She doesn't know how she
IS ): I'm here.
MEERKAT TODD: Can I get you a beer?
OLIVE: That rhymed. Olive catches the reflection behind her of a group of guys leaning against the counter, signalling `NO, DON'T DO IT' to him behind her back. She spins around and they instantly pretend to not be paying attention. She glares at them.
OLIVE: It was truly my Cindy Mancini `You! Even Bobby thinks we went out. Great, huh? Ha! All of you thought we were a couple. What a joke!. Ronald Miller paid me 1,000 bucks to pretend I liked him. What a deal, huh? $1,000 to go out with him for a month. This guy. Oh, God. He bought me. And he bought all of you. He was sick and tired of being a nobody. Yeah, and he said that all of you guys would worship him if we went out. And I didn't believe that. I was, like, no way! And he was right! No, leave me alone. He was right. Our little plan worked, didn't it, Ronald? The dance. That stupid dance! What a bunch of followers you guys are. I mean, at least I got. At least I got paid.' ( Sincerely; as herself ) `Can't Buy Me Love' is one of the best movies ever made. Hands down. You guys should totally watch it if you haven't already. Or even if you have. Seriously fine INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DAY Olive lays on her bed watching the scene from `Can't Buy Me Love' that she just performed. She eats a candy bar and wallows in her self-pity.
( MELODRAMATICALLY: REENACTING )
REENACTING ): `You! Even Bobby thinks we went out. Great, huh? Ha! All of you thought we were a couple. What a joke!. Ronald Miller paid me 1,000 bucks to pretend I liked him.

OLIVE: ( To the television ) Oh, Cindy Mancini. It could have been a lot worse. Trust me. Her mom comes in with a nicely-wrapped gift.
ROSEMARY: That kid from the other night just dropped this off for you. Indicating an empty space on the floor
OLIVE: Put it on the pile of gifts from my other suitors.
ROSEMARY: He seems like a nice boy. Gay.
OLIVE: A dyed-in-the-wool homosexual that boy is. Rosemary puts the gift on the floor.
ROSEMARY: I dated a homosexual in high We're not dating, Mom.
OLIVE: We're not dating, Mom.
ROSEMARY: I just wanted to tell you that if you want to date a gay boy, it might be hard on your father and I, at first. But we love you no matter what the sexual orientation of your opposite-sex partner. Rosemary leaves, chuckling at her own joke. Too curious, Olive opens the gift. She withdraws a PHOTO of the BULLY holding BRANDON'S LEGS while he does a KEG STAND. She smiles, pleasantly. She pulls out a PINK VIBRATOR and looks at it quizically.
OLIVE: RHIANNON ( O.S. ) Well, it's not last night's You know, I always think it's so ridiculous on TV, when someone picks up the phone and magically seems to know who's going to be on the other end. I usually preface a conversation with `hello' to avoid such banalities. The one time I decide to step outside this convention. How are you?
OLIVE: You know, I always think it's so ridiculous on TV, when someone picks up the phone and magically seems to know who's going to be on the other end. I usually preface a conversation with `hello' to avoid such banalities. The one time I decide to step outside this convention. How are you?
RHIANNON: I have many questions, obviously.
OLIVE: ( PLAYFULLY )
RHIANNON: Now is not the time to be cute.
OLIVE: You're putting me in a precarious position, because ( With her best Jackie-O
VOICE ): `according to last month's Cosmopolitan Magazine, we should always look cute. Even when we're doing mundane activities such as choosing vegetables from the produce section of our local grocery store.'
RHIANNON: Olive, stop it. This is serious. Did you really bang Brandon last night at Melanie Dipshit's party? Olive sighs as she slumps into her pillows.
OLIVE: Is that what people are saying That's what EVERYONE is saying.
RHIANNON: That's what EVERYONE is saying.
OLIVE: Then I guess it's true.
RHIANNON: Does this mean you guys are dating?
OLIVE: God no.
RHIANNON: Just because you lost your virginity doesn't mean you can go around screwing everybody!
OLIVE: ( OFF-PUT )
RHIANNON: You're getting a reputation.
OLIVE: Y'know, you're really coming off as a little pious right now and you're kind of pissing me off.
RHIANNON: Please forgive my rectitude, but I think that a best friend's duty is to let her know that everyone - and I do mean everyone - is calling her a cum dumpster.
OLIVE: Well, do YOU think I'm a cum Look, baby, I call a spade a spade. Entering the red zone
RHIANNON: Look, baby, I call a spade a spade. Entering the red zone
OLIVE: First off, that's racist. Secondly, fuck you! How dare you? I was Laura Ingalls to your Lady Chatterly and, now all of a sudden, YOU feel the need to warn ME that I'M making a fool of myself? There are a lot of children who will never again experience Family Pizza Night because of you. So, why don't you jump off your high horse and splash around in the gutter where you belong.
RHIANNON: I didn't want to believe it, but I guess it's true. You're a And you're a jealous virgin.
OLIVE: And you're a jealous virgin.
RHIANNON: Oh yeah. I totally want to lose my virginity to one of ( As if it was a disease ) your brother's friends and then be the first for a fairy, while everyone listens outside! What is wrong with you? Does sex mean anything to you?
OLIVE: Yes! It's a period of time, how ever short, that I don't have to talk to you! She slams the phone down into the cradle and seethes. Berlin's `SEX ( I'm A. )' plays loudly as. She goes into her closet and starts, wildly, pulling down clothes. She throws them into a big pile in the middle of her floor.
OLIVE: Rhiannon Abernathy only wishes that somebody wanted to pretend to sleep with her!
OLIVE: Hey, Anson.
ANSON: ( NERVOUS )
OLIVE: ( Breathy and aping Marilyn
MONROE ): I just realized the funniest thing. My name is an anagram for `I What's an anagram?
ANSON: ( STUTTERING )
OLIVE: Look it up, big boy. She rubs her knee, seductively, along his inner thigh, turns and licks her lips at a repulsed Rhiannon and continues on her way.
EVAN: Hey Olive.
OLIVE: Hi Evan.
EVAN: Can I talk to you for a second? He gestures for her to follow him underneath the bleachers. She reluctantly does so.
OLIVE: Well, rest assured, it was equally as thrilling for me.
EVAN: No, he told me the truth. She's pissed. She silently seethes.
OLIVE: ( Through clenched teeth ) Walk away, Evan. Evan starts to talk, but she raises her hand to silence him.
EVAN: I can pay you, too.
OLIVE: I'm about six seconds away from slapping you so hard that your unborn grandchildren will feel it.
EVAN: ( Excited at the prospect ) Can you do it in front of everyone? Olive turns and starts to leave. Evan summons up his courage and meekly states to her back.
OLIVE: Are you threatening me?
EVAN: I'll give you $500.
OLIVE: You're repugnant.
EVAN: ( Indicating his body ) That's the problem. And once again Olive feels too sorry for him to say no.
OLIVE: I want five hundred dollars in gift certificate form deposited in my locker before noon tomorrow. Preferably `The Gap,' but I'll also take Amazon.com. We did NOT have sex. I was piss-ass drunk and I let you fondle my chest and it was a glorious moment for you, unmatched by anything you've heretofore experienced, including cake. Got it?
EVAN: Five hundred bucks for just feeling you up? Doesn't that seem a little steep to you? Can you throw in
SOME: ( Mispronouncing it; as if it rhymed with `cottage' ) It's fraw-TAHZH, dumbass.
OLIVE: ( CORRECTING HIM )
EVAN: Little pecker? Nuh-uh. For five hundred dollars, it was ungodly huge. You even commented on the unusual girth for a guy my age.
OLIVE: I was too drunk to remember.
EVAN: Three minutes.
OLIVE: He extends his hand.
EVAN: She, repulsed by it, shakes his hand. Evan's ecstatic.
OLIVE: The sad thing is, Evan, if you had been a gentleman and asked me out on a date, I probably would have said yes.
EVAN: Really? Do you want to go on a With zero vitriol
OLIVE: Not now, I don't. Sad for him, she walks away.
OLIVE: Evan, if you're watching this - shame on you. I hope you never treat another girl the way you treated me or you will die alone, wishing it was because you're fat. And since we're playing the shame game. While I appreciate the sentiment, Lewis, a pretend hand job should have warranted a little more than a hundred dollars worth of AMC Movie Passes. They had an expiration date AND were only able to be used for movies that had been running for two weeks. But even that's better than Tyler Jennings, who gave me a ten percent off coupon to Bath and Body Works. Seriously. A fucking coupon. Is that how good my imaginary blow job was to you? Huh? Is chivalry dead? I want John Cusack holding a boombox outside my window. I want Richard Gere climbing up my fire escape with the limo waiting downstairs. I want to ride off on a lawnmower with Patrick Dempsey. Although, I'm ashamed to admit I'd prefer him to look like he looks now. What woman wouldn't? But no. I get to save two fifty on a bottle of Juniper Breeze Hand Lotion. Maybe chivalry isn't dead, but it's in a coma and the prognosis isn't ( Beat. ) So, if you're still with me - and I'm guessing that most of you are - I now present to you Part Four: How I, Olive Penderghast, Went From Assumed Trollop To an Actual Home- INT. CLASSROOM - DAY Mr. Griffin is alone grading papers. Olive pokes her head You wanted to see me?
OLIVE: You wanted to see me?
MR. GRIFFIN: Yeah, Olive. Come cop a squat. She takes a seat opposite his desk. He points to the RED "A" on her chest.
OLIVE: MR. GRIFFIN Olive, Olive, Olive. Do you think that maybe you're reading a little too much into this assignment?
MR. GRIFFIN: Olive, Olive, Olive. Do you think that maybe you're reading a little too much into this assignment?
OLIVE: Well, I'm really hoping to get an
MR. GRIFFIN: I'm hearing things. She takes a deep breath.
OLIVE: The rumors are true. I am, in fact, considering becoming an MR. GRIFFIN You know what I'm talking about.
MR. GRIFFIN: You know what I'm talking about.
OLIVE: Geez, since when did teachers become privy to idle, adolescent MR. GRIFFIN I guess it wouldn't matter so much if I didn't like you. You're a great girl and I happen to think that all of
MR. GRIFFIN: I guess it wouldn't matter so much if I didn't like you. You're a great girl and I happen to think that all of
OLIVE: Have you ever decided just to play along? Because it's maybe easier than fighting tooth-and-nail to defend it?
MR. GRIFFIN: I just don't want to see this ( He searches for the word ) damage you.
OLIVE: You know, I think you should give me extra credit for going the extra mile. I'm really attempting to understand this puritanical Mr. Griffin smiles at her.
MR. GRIFFIN: Hey, I'm really sorry I had to send you to the Principal. If you tell anybody, I'll deny it, but I really wanted to cheer with the rest of the class.
OLIVE: ( SMILING; INNOCENTLY )
MRS. GRIFFIN: Hi! How are you?
OLIVE: ( Pointing to the `A' ) A is for Awesome. Olive disappears into the empty halls.
MRS. GRIFFIN: I've never seen that girl before in my life.
MR. GRIFFIN: That doesn't surprise me.
MRS. GRIFFIN: I'm the guidance counselor. I should know all of the students. Especially the ones dressed like He kisses her.
MR. GRIFFIN: She's just going through a phase. ( He gets an idea ) Hey, do you think you could talk to her? Maybe you could get her to I dunno -
MRS. GRIFFIN: Sure. Yeah, whatever. Oh wait! That's not the girl that everyone's talking about, is it?
MR. GRIFFIN: `Fraid so.
MRS. GRIFFIN: Oh, this'll be good. That snotty office aid has been bitching about her incessantly.
MR. GRIFFIN: It's all lies. Talk to her. Maybe that's all she needs.
MRS. GRIFFIN: What are you making for dinner MR. GRIFFIN Is it my turn?
MR. GRIFFIN: Is it my turn?
MRS. GRIFFIN: Sure is. I'm meeting up with the girls at happy hour.
MR. GRIFFIN: Don't have too much fun.
MRS. GRIFFIN: I never do. He kisses her.
MARIANNE: Heavenly Father, watch over us with Your all-encompassing love. Keep us on the path toward Your righteousness and eternal They all smile, say `AMEN' and open their eyes.
NINA: Amen to THAT.
MARIANNE: Olive Penderghast. We need to pray for her, but we also need to get rid of her. I'm sure, by now, you've all heard about what happened at Melanie Bostic's party.
MARIANNE: That's not something you need to advertise, Kurt.
KURT: ( SHEEPISHLY ) ( MORE ) MARIANNE ( CONT'D )
MARIANNE: See, herein lies the problem: She's doing these tasteless, immoral acts in plain view of the entire student She's in direct opposition to everything we're trying to do for this school, which is make it a wholesome learning environment and a place where our children will one day flourish the way that we are. ( Beat. ) She was sent to the Principal's office last week
NINA: ( INTERRUPTING )
MARIANNE: and I tried to witness to her, but she's defiant to any sort of She tears up.
MICAH: No, it's not, Marianne. She wipes her tears away.
MARIANNE: Jesus tells us to love everyone. Even the whores and the homosexuals, but it's so hard.
ALL: We promise.
MARIANNE: Let's continue to pray for Olive Penderghast. That either she sees that what she's doing is a sin and changes her behavior or that she gets the hell out of our school. They all squeeze hands and Marianne manages a smile.
MRS. GRIFFIN: Hey Olive. Wanna come in?
MRS. GRIFFIN: So, the reason I called you down here is just so that we could - sort of, y'know - chat about what's going on. ( Beat. ) There's been some concern from faculty members.
OLIVE: ( CORRECTING HER )
MRS. GRIFFIN: Olive, you're attempting to make a statement. We get that. I'm just confused as to what exactly it is.
OLIVE: Am I in trouble? I promise the hem of my dress isn't higher than my MRS. GRIFFIN You're not in trouble, Olive. I just wanted you to know that if there was something you maybe needed to talk about, that you could trust me.
MRS. GRIFFIN: You're not in trouble, Olive. I just wanted you to know that if there was something you maybe needed to talk about, that you could trust me.
OLIVE: If I open up to you, do you promise this stays in confidence?
MRS. GRIFFIN: ( CONFESSIONAL )
OLIVE: ( CONFESSIONAL )
MRS. GRIFFIN: Don't you, though? Olive assesses this statement from her.
OLIVE: We done? If I can think of any angsty things to report, you'll be the first to know. She winks at her.
MRS. GRIFFIN: ( BITINGLY )
OLIVE: I'm probably closer than either of us thinks. Mrs. Griffin digs in her purse and pulls out a handful of CONDOMS. Feigning excitement
MRS. GRIFFIN: Please don't tell anyone I gave you these. The school board is
OLIVE: Puritanical and oppressive?
MRS. GRIFFIN: Olive sees that Mrs. Griffin is genuinely concerned.
OLIVE: I don't need those.
MRS. GRIFFIN: ( STERNLY )
OLIVE: Thank you.
MRS. GRIFFIN: Remember: our little secret. And, hey, would you send in the next Mrs. Griffin smiles at Olive as she leaves.
OLIVE: You're up, hoss.
MARIANNE: ( Concerned; To Micah ) It's going to be okay. She gives him a reassuring smile and he walks into her Let me guess: drugs. Marianne gives her a `go away' look.
OLIVE: ( TO MARIANNE )
MARIANNE: No, you insensitive rhymes-with- witch! His parents are going
THROUGH A: ( MORE ) MARIANNE ( CONT'D ) ( WHISPERED )
OLIVE: It's okay, Marianne. ( Not sure what to say ) Sometimes our boyfriend's parents get divorced. It's just important to know that it's not your fault.
MARIANNE: ( Through her tears ) They go to our church! Imagine what people will say! Olive didn't expect this embrace to last this long.
OLIVE: I have to go now. Are you going to be okay? Into Olive's shoulder
MARIANNE: Mrs. Griffin is going to fix everything. She's amazing. I know that she's going to help Micah through this time and everything's going to be okay.
OLIVE: Yeah. Everything's going to be Marianne pulls away and wipes tears from her eyes.
MARIANNE: Why are you being so nice to me?
OLIVE: Isn't that what we're supposed to do? Hey, it's your boss's rules. This triggers even more wails from Marianne , who grabs Olive and squeezes her tightly.
MARIANNE: I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry for everything I said.
OLIVE: Marianne pulls away again and manages to smile at her,
MRS. GRIFFIN: ( SNAPPING )
EXPEL OLIVE!: EXODUS 20:14
OLIVE: The funny thing is: the whole time this shit was going down - people calling me something I knew wasn't true, my best friend included - I couldn't help but think how I could have come up with better signs. No one even bothered to use alliteration or, God forbid, irony - not even a single acronym - and that seems a lot more unforgivable than my sins.
OLIVE: Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. I think that's how you're supposed to start these things. I'm only going on what I've seen in the movies. Then, I think I'm supposed to tell you how long it's been since my last confession, but that's kind of my first confession. I'm not Catholic. I really don't know what I'm supposed to do, except sit here in this booth and tell you what I've done wrong. Where do I even start? ( Beat. ) I've been pretending to be a how would one phrase it in Catholic words? A harlot. It's not like I've actually been doing the things that people are saying I'm doing, but - then again - I'm not denying them, so I've just been wondering: is that wrong? There's a lot of shi `crap' going down at my school which may or may not be indirectly because of this ( Beat. ) I'm lying. I may have caused the end of a marriage. I thought, in my own perverse way, that I could help it. I mean, in my defense, I am merely an adolescent. I should never have been propositioned in the way I was propositioned by an adult. But then again, I should never have consented. It was just that a lot of people had been asking me to do things and I thought it was okay, because it wasn't real.
OLIVE: Hi. I was wondering if the minister was around.
RECEPTIONIST: Pastor McGreevey is on vacation this week. But our associate pastor is in. Would you like to speak to him? For her own entertainment, Olive matches the receptionist's enthusiasm level.
OLIVE: Actually, that would be fantastic!
RECEPTIONIST: Can I tell him what this is Absolutely. I'm looking for a church to join and I thought he might be able to sell me on this fine establishment. The receptionist joyfully snatches up the phone.
OLIVE: Absolutely. I'm looking for a church to join and I thought he might be able to sell me on this fine establishment. The receptionist joyfully snatches up the phone.
RECEPTIONIST: Don, there's a young lady here who would like to speak with you about She listens and then hangs up.
OLIVE: If everyone here is as friendly as you, I think we might be in She winks at the receptionist and enters
OLIVE: I'm new to the area. Looking for a church - hopefully something with a strong fellowship, a firm foot in the soil of.
OLIVE: Oh, I agree. Wholeheartedly. But tell me: assuming there is a hell
OLIVE: Right. Okay. Let's say hell exists. Which is worse - lying or adultery? Or is lying about adultery like a double whammy?
DAUGHTER: MARIANNE BRYANT. She jumps up from her chair and recoils at the sight of the picture and the stupid mistake she made by coming there.
OLIVE: You know what. I think I'm just going to go and check out Judaism. Backing up toward the door.
OLIVE: Yes. I had unwittingly sought advice from the father of the leader of my lynch mob. Who else can say that's happened to them? ( Beat. ) As much as I want to say I hate Marianne. I don't. I get her. Well, I get certain things about her. She's passionate. Like myself. She always thinks she's right. Like myself. And, yeah, I can kind of understand why she slapped me that day. Here's what INT. BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY Marianne, excitedly, runs over to Olive who is just getting to school and throws her arms around her.
MARIANNE: Micah's in the hospital. He's in so much pain! The nurse didn't know what was wrong. Olive just holds her new friend, as she had the day before.
OLIVE: He'll be okay.
MARIANNE: ( Tears glistening in her
EYES ): Olive guides Marianne's head back to her shoulder.
MICAH: It hurts so bad. A DOCTOR enters, with a satisfied smile and a diagnosis.
DOCTOR: Micah and his mother both look up in shock. His mother takes both of her hands and begins slapping him, uncontrollably.
MICAH'S MOTHER: How did you get chlamydia? Who have you been sleeping with? Tell me! TELL ME! Micah, in pain from the burning sensation and his mother's hands flying at astonishing speed shouts out:
MICAH: Olive! Olive Penderghast! His mother's face fills with satisfaction.
MICAH'S MOTHER: ( ANGRILY )
MARIANNE: She screams so loud that Mrs. Griffin comes out of her office, a panicked expression on her face.
CHLAMYDIA!!: She screams so loud that Mrs. Griffin comes out of her office, a panicked expression on her face.
MONTANA: Olive Penderghast. She hears a slam and then a dial tone.
MRS. GRIFFIN: Are you okay, hon? Like a teapot about to start expelling steam, Marianne quivers in rage. Finally, at boiling point, she shouts
MARIANNE: But her long string of profanities is muffled by the long ringing of the school bell. Mrs. Griffin is taken aback by Marianne's umbrage. As we saw before
THAT: But her long string of profanities is muffled by the long ringing of the school bell. Mrs. Griffin is taken aback by Marianne's umbrage. As we saw before
RHIANNON: My sentiments exactly.
OLIVE: ( SNIDELY )
MICAH: ( Into the cell phone ) I didn't know what to say! I panicked! I said I got it from Olive Penderghast. ( Pause. ) I know, but what was I supposed to say?! And then my mom called her ( Pause. ) No, not Olive's. Marianne's! ( Pause. ) I already tried to blame it on their divorce, but my mom's not buying it. I have to tell them. ( Pause. ) Okay. But I love you. I don't care if you gave me chlamydia. I LOVE YOU and I want to be with you and no one can stop us. Not my mother, not Marianne, not There's a dial tone.
MRS. GRIFFIN: ( SNAPPING )
OLIVE: I'm sorry, I was just looking for Marianne. Did she say something about being mad at me? She just smacked the shi `crap' out of This makes Mrs. Griffin cry even harder. She attempts to pull herself together.
MRS. GRIFFIN: It's my fault. I'm so sorry, Olive looks at her, quizzically.
OLIVE: Don't get me wrong. I love it, but I don't think you're supposed to use those words around a student.
MRS. GRIFFIN: Yeah, well, you're not to supposed to fuck them, either. But it didn't stop me. Olive puts two and two together in her head. She gasps a little louder than she planned.
OLIVE: You and Oh my God. I'm not judging you or anything, but oh my Wait. What does that have to do with me? Mrs. Griffin walks over and locks her office door. She fights back more tears, as she tries to explain to Olive.
MRS. GRIFFIN: No you haven't.
OLIVE: Call Micah. Tell him I said he's an asshole and that he owes me SO big for this and also the time I pretended not to see him during a third grade game of hide and seek. Tell him I still remember that. But tell him that I confessed to giving him chlamydia. Mrs. Griffin grabs Olive and cries on her.
MRS. GRIFFIN: ( SNIVELING )
OLIVE: ( MATERNALLY )
OLIVE: So, really how could I be angry at Dude, if some bimbo gave MY boyfriend an STD, I'd have swung, but I'd have balled my fist.
THOUGHT ): With all the mythical play I was getting, it's a wonder - and probably a miracle - that I still hadn't actually been asked out on a real date. Guys were clamoring to claim that they'd slept with me, but no one was putting the real moves on me. Until finally.
ANSON: Hey Olive. Olive smiles sweetly at him.
OLIVE: ( SUSPICIOUS )
ANSON: I dunno. I was thinking about chartering a hot air balloon, taking along a bottle of champagne and fresh fruit and then trying to impress you with an overzealous reading of Emily Dickinson.
OLIVE: ( COYLY )
ANSON: ( IMPRESSED )
OLIVE: ( IMPRESSED )
OLIVE: I can't believe you brought me to the nicest restaurant in town. This is swank. I was beginning to think that there was no such thing as class.
ANSON: Yeah. What's better than getting to select your dinner and have nice conversation while they boil it alive in the back?
OLIVE: I think Anson Jr. doesn't mind making the sacrifice. You don't mind that I named him Anson Jr., do Not at all. I'm actually kind of Do you believe this whole thing about lobster being an aphrodisiac?
ANSON: Not at all. I'm actually kind of Do you believe this whole thing about lobster being an aphrodisiac?
OLIVE: Do you believe this whole thing about lobster being an aphrodisiac?
ANSON: ( Lying out his ass ) I didn't know it was.
OLIVE: Y'know, medical science has not substantiated claims that any particular food increases sexual desire or performance. It's so funny when guys ply women with food that they think is gonna get them laid. I mean, what's really sexy about slurping back oysters? You know, native people believed that you gained the strength of the animal by consuming it. Some people grind up rhinoceros horn, because it's thought to stiffen the male sex organ. It's all bullshit. And spanish fly? It's pulverized beetle that people eat! Although, it's illegal for human consumption in the United States and do you know why? Because if you take just a bit too much, it causes painful urination, fever and bloody A SERVER appears with their LOBSTER. Anson is an odd shade of green from Olive's little science lesson.
MEERKAT TODD: I don't know but I've been told!
OLIVE: ( TO ANSON )
MEERKAT TODD: Marguerite is getting old!
OLIVE: MEERKAT TODD MEERKAT TODD
MEERKAT TODD: The best thing is her dessert is PARADE OF SERVERS The best thing is her dessert is The worst thing is I sing off-key!
MEERKAT TODD: The worst thing is I sing off-key!
MEERKAT TODD: Sound off!
MEERKAT TODD: Sound off!
MEERKAT TODD: Sound off!
ANSON: What's wrong?
OLIVE: Rhiannon's over there.
ANSON: So? She's been in love with you since the first grade.
OLIVE: So? She's been in love with you since the first grade.
ANSON: Well, she's my best friend.
OLIVE: Well, she's my best friend.
ANSON: I thought you two weren't speaking.
OLIVE: We're not, but it doesn't mean I should be out with you.
ANSON: Then why are you?
OLIVE: I don't know. You asked me out?
ANSON: Exactly. I have no interest in her. I mean, we're friends, but
OLIVE: She can't see us.
ANSON: ( DISAPPOINTED )
OLIVE: ( TOUCHED )
ANSON: Could we get our check?
SERVER: ( CONFUSED )
OLIVE: I just remembered I'm allergic to shellfish. I always forget that my respiratory system would collapse and I'd die. It sucks I know. Even more confused, the server obliges and gives them their ( Digging in her purse ) Let me get it. I have a gift She pulls it out and hands it to the waitress, who leaves.
ANSON: But I asked you out.
OLIVE: And I ruined it, so let me bear the financial brunt. ( Beat. ) I'm so sorry about this. But she really likes you.
ANSON: She and I just don't have much in And you and I do?
OLIVE: And you and I do?
ANSON: I think so. For instance, I, too think Nina Howell's a twat.
OLIVE: Yeah, well, if that's our magical connection, I should date the entire school.
ANSON: Haven't you? Olive suddenly becomes self-conscious and a little bit Yeah, about that The server reappears with the check.
OLIVE: Yeah, about that The server reappears with the check.
SERVER: You have a remaining balance of fourteen dollars and thirty six Keep it. Tip. The sever smiles and leaves them again.
OLIVE: Keep it. Tip. The sever smiles and leaves them again.
ANSON: Let's get out of here. They duck out of the booth trying to keep their heads down, but Olive can't resist the urge to look up and see if Rhiannon sees them. She does. Olive and Rhiannon make eye contact. Whereas, Olive looks remorseful, Rhiannon looks like she's just been stabbed in the back which she has. The Abernathys see her, as well, and wave. It's painfully obvious to Olive that Rhi hasn't told her parents about their differences. She starts to go over, but Rhiannon's face is turning vermillion in anger. Olive just waves, sheepishly and leaves with Anson.
ANSON: I have something for you. Olive manages a smile. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a $500 GIFT CERTIFICATE to ANTHROPOLOGIE and hands it to Olive is disappointed, but tries not to show it.
OLIVE: Oh. I didn't realize Snapping out of her guilt.
ANSON: Whatever $500 gets me. He leans over and kisses her. She pushes him off.
OLIVE: Wait. This isn't how it works. I don't actually But he's kissing her again, a little too forcibly. She pushes him off again.
ANSON: We can go wherever you want, but I think it would be kind of hot here. He takes off his shirt.
OLIVE: Dude, I gotta go. It's been She gets out of the car. He rolls down the window.
ANSON: Olive, you're being stupid. I'll take you home.
OLIVE: No thanks. He drives off, leaving her outside in the parking lot.
MEERKAT TODD: Hey Olive!
OLIVE: Hey Todd.
MEERKAT TODD: What are you doing here?
OLIVE: Oh, I'm just hanging out in the parking lot. I do that sometimes. Not necessarily just here. The one outside of Applebee's is fun, too.
MEERKAT TODD: ( Laughing at her oddness ) You want a ride somewhere?
OLIVE: Nah. I'm fine.
MEERKAT TODD: Your friend Rhi is inside. It's her Mom's birthday. Tears begin to glisten in Olive's eyes.
OLIVE: She's not my friend anymore. Todd walks over and puts his arm around her and leads her to his car. He opens the door for her and she sits down.
MEERKAT TODD: You wanna talk about it?
OLIVE: What's to say? I'm a horrible person. Everyone thinks I'm a whore and, for the first time, I'm starting to believe it.
MEERKAT TODD: Oh, don't act like you don't know what people are saying about me.
OLIVE: Oh, don't act like you don't know what people are saying about me.
MEERKAT TODD: I know what people are saying. Doesn't mean I believe them.
OLIVE: Why not?
MEERKAT TODD: Olive, contrary to popular belief, I'm not an idiot. I know exactly what's going on and I know exactly what you're doing. She stops crying.
OLIVE: Who told you?
MEERKAT TODD: No one had to tell me. All I know is once upon a time, there was a scared little kid in a closet at a party who wasn't ready for his first kiss and there was this amazing little girl who lied for She smiles through her tears.
OLIVE: You remember that?
MEERKAT TODD: Yeah and after I ran out, you pulled Brandon in. Yeah, I know about that, by the way.
OLIVE: And look how he turned out.
MEERKAT TODD: Sometimes I still pretend you were my first kiss.
OLIVE: ( LAUGHING )
MEERKAT TODD: Your friend. Rhiannon. Olive's laughter turns to rage.
OLIVE: MEERKAT TODD
MEERKAT TODD: Yeah. About a year later. It ( Blurting it out ) She knew how I felt about you!
OLIVE: ( Blurting it out ) She knew how I felt about you!
MEERKAT TODD: How do you feel about me?
OLIVE: ( IGNORING HIM )
MEERKAT TODD: Wait. How do you feel about me?
OLIVE: ( AGGRESSIVELY DEFENSIVE )
MEERKAT TODD: ( DISAPPOINTED )
OLIVE: ( Off his look ) I mean, it's not that I don't still feel that way. There's an awkward moment between them.
MEERKAT TODD: Olive. If I promise not to tell anyone, could I kiss you? Despite the fact that this is positively the most romantic moment of her young life, Olive looks down.
OLIVE: No. Not tonight. I don't want you to kiss me when mascara's running down my cheek or some shithead has forced his tongue down my throat only a half-hour ago. I've wanted to kiss you since the eighth grade, but I want it to be perfect. And right now, my life's a mess. I need to get it under control before I drag you into it.
MEERKAT TODD: What if I told you I wanted to be dragged into it? Maybe I could He holds out his hand and she takes it.
OLIVE: Now I have a reason to fix this catastrophe I've brought upon myself. And I'm going to.
MEERKAT TODD: He smiles his goofy grin and she embraces him. She hops out of the car and goes to her front door.
OLIVE: You see, now I had a reason for things to go back to the way that they were.
GOSSIPY GIRL: Oh my God, did you hear that Brandon ran away from home? Yeah. Totally. He left his parents a note that said: `Eff you, I'm gay.' And then he skipped town with a big, hulking black guy. We spin around to see Olive's stunned reaction.
OLIVE: ( TO HERSELF )
GOSSIPY GIRL: The reality of the situation begins to weigh on her.
OLIVE: Defeated, Olive makes her way through the crowded halls.
EVAN: No way. I gave you money.
OLIVE: Please, Evan. He walks off, leaving her alone.
MRS. GRIFFIN: Olive, life is full of choices. I made a bad one. But then, so did you. We both acted unwisely, but I don't see any other alternative than to live with the guilt. My guilt stems from my indiscretion, yours for lying. We've made our choices. Now, we have to ride them ( Pissed as hell ) Or I could just tell everyone THE
OLIVE: ( Pissed as hell ) Or I could just tell everyone THE
MRS. GRIFFIN: Fine, Olive. Let's play the `who do you believe' game. But, first, ask yourself, if you were an adult, who would you believe?
OLIVE: With all due respect, Mrs. Griffin, you're a fucking cunt.
MRS. GRIFFIN: Because you helped me once, I'm not going to report that to Principal Gibbons. Now, we're even. They're locked in a Mexican standoff.
OLIVE: Your wife has chlamydia and she's been sleeping with a student and she gave it to him and now she's trying to blame me. Shocked, Mr. Griffin drops the eraser.
MR. GRIFFIN: The gravity of what she's just done sinks in and she Not knowing what to say, she runs from his classroom.
OLIVE: I I'm sorry. I Not knowing what to say, she runs from his classroom.
OLIVE: Looking back, that's the thing I regret the most. That's the thing that sent me to the church, er, churches. And that's the thing that made me realize how profoundly I'd fucked up.
MR. GRIFFIN: It's not your fault. Olive gets a tear in her eyes. She puts a RED CHIP in at the top and loses the game. She reaches over and presses the lever, causing all of the chips to fall on his desk.
OLIVE: I'm so sorry.
MR. GRIFFIN: No. It's not your fault. They just hold each other. Finally, Mr. Griffin pulls away and takes his things and starts to leave. But then he turns and says
OLIVE: Me too. Where are you going?
MR. GRIFFIN: Not sure yet. Away from her.
OLIVE: Can I come? They share one last, pained smile and he leaves.
OLIVE: Mr. Griffin, if you ever see this, just know - I was wrong to tell you that. In that way. At all. I don't know. I shouldn't have done it. I don't feel bad for lying for your wife. But I hate myself for telling you the truth. I'm so She wipes away a tear, pulls herself together.
EXPEL OLIVE!: EXODUS 20:14
OLIVE: Oh fuck me. Things have gotten WAY too out of hand.
OLIVE: So, now everyone who knows the truth is either gone or won't fess up. The Cross Your Legs Club is demanding my head. And the messed up thing is that I wouldn't put it past Gibbons to expel me.
ROSEMARY: I had a similar situation when I was your age.
OLIVE: ( IN DISBELIEF )
ROSEMARY: Yes. I had a horrible reputation and people said awful things about me. But it was true. I was a Olive gives her a suspicious look.
OLIVE: I'm waiting for you to say ( Imitating her mother ) `Just kidding!'
ROSEMARY: ( EARNESTLY )
OLIVE: Well! It was a different time.
ROSEMARY: Well! It was a different time.
OLIVE: I did. I got around. Before I met your father, I was a garden variety Why are you telling me this?
ROSEMARY: I did. I got around. Before I met your father, I was a garden variety Why are you telling me this?
OLIVE: Why are you telling me this?
ROSEMARY: Because I endured a similar lynching because of a certain I promise that it was no worse than Marianne Bryant's attack on me.
OLIVE: I promise that it was no worse than Marianne Bryant's attack on me.
ROSEMARY: Wanna bet? It was her mother.
OLIVE: Wait, what?
ROSEMARY: Yep. Don Bryant and I got caught in a very compromising position in the locker room during a basketball That's disgusting! He's He wasn't back then. He was actually pretty handsome. All I'm saying is that MAYBE the reason that Bryant girl is going after you is because her mother told her about me.
OLIVE: That's disgusting! He's He wasn't back then. He was actually pretty handsome. All I'm saying is that MAYBE the reason that Bryant girl is going after you is because her mother told her about me.
ROSEMARY: He wasn't back then. He was actually pretty handsome. All I'm saying is that MAYBE the reason that Bryant girl is going after you is because her mother told her about me.
OLIVE: So, the sins of the mother are revisited on the daughter.
ROSEMARY: There's something else you should know. This is hard to say but Don Bryant is your father. Marianne is your sister.
OLIVE: I hate you so much right now. Can't you see I'm a mess!
ROSEMARY: No, you're not, Olive. You're wonderful. And you're going to handle this the same way that I did. With an incontrovertible sense of humor. They embrace and Olive gets an idea.
OLIVE: Thanks for the pep talk, Mom. Now get out. I need to make some phone Rosemary looks slightly concerned by the grin on Olive's INT. GYM - DAY We join a pep rally, already in progress. The DANCE TEAM attempts to rile up the school with a rousing rendition of Michael Jackson's `BAD.' In the stands, Rhi sits with Marianne and Nina.
MARIANNE: So, Olive wasn't at school today. She extends her palms to Nina and Rhi, who both slap them. Marianne puts her arm around Rhi.
RHIANNON: Me too. You guys fucking rock.
MARIANNE: We don't say that word, Rhiannon.
NINA: ( HELPFULLY )
RHIANNON: But isn't that just implying the same word?
MARIANNE: Oh, Rhiannon. We have so much to teach you. It's okay to imply Rhiannon looks at her new best friends, who just smile at The song ends and there's a drum roll.
RHIANNON: Yay! It's time for Meerkat Todd.
MARIANNE: Why don't you just not talk for a while, okay hon? Rhi puts her head down. The drum roll ends and Meerkat Todd bounces out in costume. He jumps around enthusing the student body But then he goes out of the gym and reenters pushing a
OLIVE: Nobody does it better. Makes me feel sad for the rest. Nobody does it half as good as me. Baby, I'm the best. Todd lifts Olive out of the dumpster and she sings her ass off - and she's quite good.
LASCIVIOUSLY ): or watch me do one. There are audible gasps, but excitement nonetheless. Gibbons angrily storms over and takes the microphone.
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: ( Through gritted teeth ) Young lady, to my office. NOW.
OLIVE: Yeah, I can't. I'm gonna go bang my boyfriend while the whole school watches. But good luck with the game-thing. Go Meerkats. She plods out, triumphantly.
OLIVE: And here you all are. Waiting outside the closet door for me to kiss Todd, listening to me pretend to have sex with Brandon, paying me to lie for you, calling probably the last virgin in school a whore. Guys. Seriously. All of a sudden from outside and downstairs James' `LAID' begins to play. Olive goes over to the window and sees Todd below, holding up a BOOMBOX ( a la John Cusack ) and there's a RIDE-ON LAWN MOWER ( a la Patrick Dempsey ) behind him. Upon seeing this, she bursts into laughter, but it couldn't be more romantic.
MEERKAT TODD: ( SHOUTING UP )
OLIVE: I see you've been watching my live webcast. It's still going on, you Fuck them. They've had enough of you. Well, figuratively speaking. I borrowed my neighbor's John Deere. Come down here.
MEERKAT TODD: Fuck them. They've had enough of you. Well, figuratively speaking. I borrowed my neighbor's John Deere. Come down here.
OLIVE: That rhymed.
MEERKAT TODD: Be right down. Olive can't get the smile off of her face as she goes back to the camera. We see her through the lens.
OLIVE: Be right down. Olive can't get the smile off of her face as she goes back to the camera. We see her through the lens.
MONTAGE: We see, from the perspective of their computer screens, various reactions to Olive's webcast A proud Brandon watches from a hotel room. A MUSCULAR BLACK GUY in a towel comes up behind him and kisses his neck. The Abernathys watch with the same demented glee they derive from watching anything. Mrs. Griffin watches with the face of a person who's been found out and who's days are numbered. They are.
MELANIE: ( SATISFIED )
ANSON: ( TO HIMSELF )
