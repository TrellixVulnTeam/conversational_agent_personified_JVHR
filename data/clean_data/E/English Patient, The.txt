JAN: There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
HANA: I'm not sewing anything else.
JAN: ( mischievously ) You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
HANA: Hana, I know you do! Hana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some DOLLARS. The two hands - hers and Jan's - reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side by side. They laugh at the effort. Jan's GOLD BRACELET catches the sun and glints.
JAN: Hana, I know you do! Hana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some DOLLARS. The two hands - hers and Jan's - reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side by side. They laugh at the effort. Jan's GOLD BRACELET catches the sun and glints.
HANA: I'm not sewing anything else for you!
JAN: ( getting the money ) I love you. The Jeep accelerates away. Hana sighs to the patient. Suddenly AN EXPLOSION shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a MINE. The jeep is THROWN into the air. The convoy halts and there's chaos as soldiers run back pulling people out of the vehicles. Hana runs the other way, towards the accident, until she is prevented from passing by a soldier.
KIP: Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey!
HARDY: Don't move! Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. Hardy gingerly follows her footsteps.
HARDY: ( as he approaches ) Good, that's good, just stay still for me and then we're going to be fine. He arrives at Hana. Then grabs her. He'd like to slap her face.
HARDY: What are you doing?! What the bloody hell do you think you're doing? By way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet. Jan's BRACELET lies in the mud. Hardy bends down and collects the mangled bracelet, presses it into Hana's hands.
HANA: Do you need something? The Patient nods. Hana gets up to prepare MORPHINE INJECTION from a small kit. Mary arrives. Touches Hana gently, conscious of her grief for Jan's death.
MARY: Are you okay? Oh God, Hana, you were like sisters.
HANA: ( sighs angrily ) We keep moving him - in and out of the truck. Why? He's dying. What's the point?
MARY: Well, we can't hardly leave him. Do you mean leave him? We can't. Hana has settled down beside the Patient's stretcher. She draws herself up against the night. On the hill above, she can see the outline of A SMALL MONASTERY in the moonlight. She's crying, her face a frozen mask.
HANA: I must be a curse. Anybody who loves me, anybody who gets close to me - or I must be cursed. Which is it? The Patient laces her fingers into his crabbed hand.
HANA: The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
OLIVER: It's not over everywhere. I didn't mean When he dies I'll catch up. Oliver hovers as Hana adds the rice to a small cache of provisions, then lays another blanket over the Patient.
HANA: When he dies I'll catch up. Oliver hovers as Hana adds the rice to a small cache of provisions, then lays another blanket over the Patient.
OLIVER: It's not safe here. The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what. It's madness. I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us. Hana -
HANA: I need morphine. A lot. And a pistol.
OLIVER: ( clutching at straws ) And what if he really is a spy?
HANA: ( impatiently ) He can't even move.
OLIVER: If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself. Hana nods. A tiny smile. Oliver shrugs helplessly.
OLIVER: We're heading for Leghorn. Livorno the Italians call it. We'll expect you.
HANA: Up there. They struggle up the stairs, one of the Soldiers gasping as he narrowly avoids falling into the void in the stairs. The cot almost tips up, at which the Patient SUDDENLY SPEAKS, his voice cracked and rasping, but still clearly aristocratic.
THE PATIENT: There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
HANA: Because you're leaning? No, you're just on an angle. You're too heavy! Mary laughs. They reach the landing. Hana kicks open the door to the
HANA: In here. 18a. INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY. Hana lets Mary take the weight while she goes to the bed and pulls away the drapes, sending up a cloud of dust. They lower the Patient onto the bed. She turns to the SOLDIERS.
HANA: Thank you. She shuts the door on them, leaving Mary staring aghast at the room, its faded frescoes, its mold, its chaos. Hana smiles, opens a shutter to let a fierce envelope of light into the room.
HANA: She goes to Mary and hugs her.
D'AGOSTINO: ( sniffing inside ) What's this?
MADOX: ( sniffing inside ) What's this?
D'AGOSTINO: Don't drink it! He reaches for the jug, then pours out a little sludge - it's a brackish and stinks. Madox makes a face.
D'AGOSTINO: I can't guarantee the vintage, my friends. I just dug it out of the hill. Madox and Almásy have seen many such jugs.
MADOX: Excellent. That's terrific, D'Ag. Toss that up, would you.
D'AGOSTINO: ( mischievously ) There are some others.
MADOX: ( to Almásy, astonished ) My God, look at this! They bend to touch the jars, literally hundreds of them, mostly broken, piled on top of each other. Bermann approaches them, carrying his Incredible, Hmm? Quite incredible.
BERMANN: Incredible, Hmm? Quite incredible.
D'AGOSTINO: I've never seen anything like it. There would have been enough water here to serve an army.
ALMÁSY: ( gloomily ) Which means we're in the wrong place. Almásy speaks with a slight but unmistakable European accent.
D'AGOSTINO: Would you stockpile water near to an Oasis? There can't be a natural spring within fifty miles of here.
ALMÁSY: Would you stockpile water near to an Oasis? There can't be a natural spring within fifty miles of here.
FOUAD: Or they didn't know of one.
BERMANN: So, it may not be Zerzura, still A pottery hill!
D'AGOSTINO: ( nodding, delighted ) A pottery hill!
ALMÁSY: A wild goose chase.
MADOX: ( firmly ) Almásy gives him a look. But Madox will have none of it.
MADOX: No. Now we look in the other places. We're eliminating. The unmistakable buzz of AN AEROPLANE distracts them.
MADOX: Good, and here comes reinforcements. 21a. EXT. BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL. DAY. LATER and a smart new aeroplane, a STEERMAN, makes a smooth landing on the flat desert. The expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals. Almásy is not with them. He's walking, apparently not so enthusiastic. A young, kissed and newly-married couple emerge from the plane. They are GEOFFREY AND KATHARINE CLIFTON. And it's immediately clear that Katharine is the woman in the plane- crash at the beginning of the film. Madox makes all the introductions. Hands are shaken, hellos all round, as the couple disembark in their leather flying gear. Geoffrey removes his helmet and, in what we will come to know as an ubiquitous gesture, produces a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and sets off the cork with a flourish.
CLIFTON: I hereby Christen us the International Sand Club!
MADOX: Marvelous plane. Did you look?
CLIFTON: ( beaming at Almásy ) Isn't it? Wedding present from Katharine's parents. I'm calling it Rupert Bear. Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.
MADOX: We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almásy smiles and walks on towards the others.
D'AGOSTINO: Mrs. Clifton - Count Almasy.
KATHARINE: ( smiling, offering her hand ) Geoffrey gave me your monograph when I was reading up on the desert. Very impressive.
ALMÁSY: ( stiff ) Thank you.
KATHARINE: I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
ALMÁSY: A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it. Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
CLIFTON: ( joining them and joining in ) A broken car?
ALMÁSY: Still a car.
CLIFFTON: ( hands them champagne ) Not much use, though.
KATHARINE: Love? Romantic love, platonic love, filial love - ? Quite different things, Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love. Excessive love of one's wife.
CLIFTON: ( hugging Katharine ) Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love. Excessive love of one's wife.
ALMÁSY: ( a dry smile ) There you have me.
THE PATIENT: What was all the banging? Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
HANA: I was repairing the stairs. I found a library and the books were very useful. Hana shrugs. She's attending to him, pulling back the sheets, plumping up the pillows. He's short of breath.
THE PATIENT: Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
HANA: I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes. What about your own book?
THE PATIENT: ( reluctant ) My book? The Herodotus? Yes, we can read him. Hana picks up the book and hands it to him. Then she starts rummaging in her pockets.
HANA: Oh - I've found plums. We have plums in the orchard. We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
THE PATIENT: Thank you. His mouth works with the pleasure of the taste, a little juice escaping from the mouth. Hana mops it up.
THE PATIENT: The plumness of this plum. A noise, GURGLING sound, disturbs them.
THE PATIENT: What's that?
HANA: ( bends to the Tortois ) You hear it, too, don't you!
FOUAD: European, I think, with guides.
CLIFTON: ( can only see shapes ) How do you know?
MADOX: ( frowns ) Yes, and I think I know who this is.
MADOX: ( stiffly ) Yes, I think a sailor can call himself an explorer, can't he? Or should Columbus have swum to America?
ALMÁSY: Yes, I think a sailor can call himself an explorer, can't he? Or should Columbus have swum to America?
MADOX: I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
CLIFTON: This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
MADOX: This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
KATHARINE: I'm also searching for the lost Oasis, but by more authentic means.
MADOX: ( of Almásy ) Anyway, my friend here has a new theory - that Zerzura doesn't exist. So we may all be chasing windmills. Have some food.
KATHARINE: Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
ALMÁSY: What kind of fossils?
ALMÁSY: I think you know I am.
ALMÁSY: ( leaving the tent ) If you come across my bones - I hope you'll do me the honor of leaving them in peace. ( to Katharine ) Excuse me.
KATHARINE: I can't sing. but I can tell a story. I might need a prompt. Do you have your Herodotus? I've noticed you carry it.
ALMÁSY: I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
MADOX: Your book. Your Herodotus! Almásy looks uncomfortable.
KATHARINE: ( reacting quickly ) It doesn't matter. Really. I think I can muddle through. Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife - ( Geoffrey whistles proudly ) One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
ALMÁSY: ( quietly prompting her ) ( smiles ) Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women. Do you all know this story? The men all encourage her to continue her story.
KATHARINE: ( smiles ) Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women. Do you all know this story? The men all encourage her to continue her story.
HANA: ( reading from the Herodotus ) I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
THE PATIENT: ( not neurotic ) Candaules.you're laughing at me.
HANA: ( not neurotic ) Candaules.you're laughing at me.
THE PATIENT: I'm not laughing at you. Go on, please.
HANA: When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure.
KATHARINE: ( her story continuing ) And that evening, it's exactly as the King had told him, she goes to the chair and removes her clothes, one by one, until she stand naked in full view of Gyges. And indeed she was more lovely than he could have imagined. Almásy stares at her, framed by the velvet black sky. Katharine turns to looks at him.
KATHARINE: But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him. And hearing his story, she said this -
CLIFTON: Off with his head!
KATHERINE: death for gazing on that which you should not, or else kill my husband who shamed me and become King in his place. Clifton makes a face of outrage. For Katherine the story has collapsed. She wants it to be finished.
#NAME?: death for gazing on that which you should not, or else kill my husband who shamed me and become King in his place. Clifton makes a face of outrage. For Katherine the story has collapsed. She wants it to be finished.
KATHERINE: So Gyges killed the King and married the Queen and became ruler of Lydia for twenty eight years. The End. Do I spin the bottle? Almásy shrinks away from the fire, disappears into black.
MADOX: ( to Clifton ) And let that be a lesson to you!
HANA: Are you asleep?
THE PATIENT: ( lying ) Yes. Dropping off. And Hana closes the book, gets up, and blows out the lamp.
MADOX: What did you think you were doing in his tent?
ALMÁSY: Looking for the fossils. Why should we wait until we're in London? This girl was probably twelve years old.
MADOX: ( getting into the plane ) You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
ALMÁSY: Her hands and feet were tied.
MADOX: What did you do?
ALMÁSY: I looked at them. They're shrubs, small trees. Exquisite. And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
MADOX: I was talking about the girl.
ALMÁSY: Cut the ropes. I left a note, on his blanket. At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot. The Girl wouldn't leave, of course. Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
HANA: I should try and move your bed. I want you to be able to see the view. It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
THE PATIENT: I can already see.
HANA: ( bending down to his level ) How? How can you see anything?
THE PATIENT: Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert. I've found the lost fossils.
HANA: I'm turning you. An awkward moment as she rolls him on to his back. He grunts with the pain. She washes him very tenderly.
THE PATIENT: Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds. As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room. I can smell it. The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth. I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint. Is there sand in my eyes? Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
HANA: No sand. That's your drugs speaking.
THE PATIENT: I can see my wife in that view.
HANA: Are you remembering more?
THE PATIENT: Could I have a cigarette?
HANA: Are you crazy?
THE PATIENT: Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
HANA: Because I'm a nurse.
HANA: How are you?
BOY: Your leg will be fine. A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
HANA: Your leg will be fine. A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
BOY: You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
HANNA: ( she hears this every day ) I don't think so.
BOY: Would you kiss me?
HANA: No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples. You'll find a girl there.
BOY: ( innocent ) Just kiss me. It would mean such a lot to me.
HANA: ( tender, believing him ) Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
BOY: Thank you. He closes his eyes. Is almost instantly asleep. Hana smiles, continues along the compartment. VOICES CALL OUT.
HANA: ( good-naturedly waving away their joke ) Very funny. Go to sleep. She gets into a corridor. Mary is coming the other way. She carries a blood-soaked bundle. Hana questions her appalled expression.
MARY: Don't ask.
HANA: Where are we going? I don't want to be kissing in a crowd. I have six hours. She jumps out of the moving door and into his arms.
STUART: ( laughing at her ferocity ) Whoa - give me a chance!
HANA: Sorry. I took a Benzedrine. The Station is full of desperate people trying to make do. the couple hurry through, oblivious to anyone except each other.
STUART: I've got a surprise. A boat! We can go to Capri. It's got a cabin, it's private.
HANA: I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
STUART: We can do that when we're very very old.
CARAVAGGIO: ( very cheerful ) Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
CARAVAGGIO: Are you Hana?
HANA: What do you want?
CARAVAGGIO: I met your friend Mary. She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier. Bonjour.
HANA: ( unraveling this information ) He goes to her and - putting a bandaged hand behind her ear - PRODUCES AN EGG. He beams, as does Hana.
CARAVAGGIO: I'd like to take credit, but it's from Mary. My name's David Caravaggio, but nobody ever called me David. Caravaggio they find to absurd to miss out on. During this he attempts the same thing with his other hand to Hana's other ear. THE EGG DROPS TO THE GROUND. Cursing, he gets on his knees and starts to scoop it up, preserving it.
CARAVAGGIO: They're fresh. I haven't eaten an egg in.have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
HANA: You were in Africa?
CARAVAGGIO: Yeah, for a while.
HANA: So was my Patient.
CARAVAGGIO: I'd like to stay. That's the long and short of it. I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah. I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -
#NAME?: relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug. I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
HANA: So you can shoot a pistol?
CARAVAGGIO: ( showing his hands ) If you said yes I would have had a reason. You should let me redress those bandages. Before you go.
HANA: If you said yes I would have had a reason. You should let me redress those bandages. Before you go.
CARAVAGGIO: I'm okay. Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other. I can shoot a pistol! I'll sleep in the stables. I don't care where I sleep. I don't sleep.
HANA: Because we're fine here. I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
CARAVAGGIO: Fine. I'm not looking.
HANA: There's a man downstairs. He brought us eggs. He might stay.
THE PATIENT: Why? Can he lay eggs?
HANA: He's Canadian.
THE PATIENT: ( brittle ) Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place? What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
HANA: He needn't disturb you.
THE PATIENT: Me? He can't. I'm already disturbed.
HANA: He won't disturb us then. I think he's after morphine. into tiny pieces ) There's a war. Where you come from becomes important. And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices. The Patient says nothing. She puts a spoonful of the omelette into his mouth. He grunts.
ALMÁSY: How much did you pay?
KATHARINE: ( delighted ) Hello! Good morning.
ALMÁSY: They don't see foreign women in this market. How much did you pay?
KATHARINE: Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
ALMÁSY: Which stall?
KATHARINE: Excuse me?
ALMÁSY: You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
KATHARINE: ( bristling ) I don't want to go back.
ALMÁSY: This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
KATHARINE: I don't care to bargain.
ALMÁSY: That insults them.
KATHARINE: ( turning to face him ) I don't believe that. I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
ALMÁSY: ( of the carpet ) I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this. I apologize if I appear abrupt. I am rusty at social graces. ( tart ) How do you find Cairo? Did you visit the Pyramids?
KATHARINE: Excuse me. He stands as she continues, pushing past him, shrugging off the children, boiling.
CLIFTON: Gentlemen, good evening! He sits down. Madox hails the waiter.
D'AGOSTINO: How is your charming wife?
CLIFTON: Uh, marvelous. She's in love with the hotel plumbing. She's either in the swimming pool - she swims for hours, she's a fish, quite incredible - or she's in the bath. Actually, she's just outside. bewildered expressions ) Chaps Only in the Long Bar.
MADOX: ( standing, embarrassed ) Of course. Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
CLIFTON: Oh no, really. She has her book.
MADOX: I won't hear of it. None of us will.
MADOX: Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us. We're not accustomed to the company of women.
KATHARINE: Not at all. I was thoroughly enjoying by book. and then nodding at Almásy before greeting the others ) Please. Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
CLIFTON: The team is in mourning, darling.
KATHARINE: Oh really?
MADOX: I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
KATHARINE: How awful. What will you do?
MADOX: A more modest expedition, or even wait a year. Remind our families we still exist.
CLIFTON: ( astonished ) Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
MADOX: Very much so. We are all, save my friend here. He nods at Almasy. Clifton appears tremendously relieved.
CLIFTON: I feel much better, don't you darling? We were feeling rather self-conscious. Let's toast, then. To absent wives.
D'AGOSTINO: ( toasting Katharine ) And present ones.
KATHARINE: ( toasting Almásy ) And future ones.
KATHARINE: Why did you follow me yesterday?
ALMÁSY: Excuse me?
KATHARINE: After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
ALMÁSY: I was concerned. As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
KATHARINE: You felt obliged to.
ALMÁSY: As the wife of one of our party.
KATHARINE: ( sardonic ) So why follow me? Escort me, by all means. Following me is predatory, isn't it? The dance finishes. They walk back to their table, where Almásy leads Katharine back to her seat next to Clifton.
CLIFTON: I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
KATHARINE: ( interrupting ) Darling, for goodness' sake!
CLIFTON: Well, she is!
CARAVAGGIO: THE PATIENT Finally! So you're our Canadian pickpocket? He goes to help Hana, they work as he talks.
THE PATIENT: Finally! So you're our Canadian pickpocket? He goes to help Hana, they work as he talks.
CARAVAGGIO: Thief, I think, is more accurate.
THE PATIENT: I understand you were in Africa. Oh, all over.
CARAVAGGIO: Oh, all over.
THE PATIENT: All over? I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed. Are you leaving us? Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
HANA: Then I'm definitely going. And she exits. The men consider her.
CARAVAGGIO: Does she have war wounds?
THE PATIENT: I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
CARAVAGGIO: Are you planning to be the exception?
THE PATIENT: Me? You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy. So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
CARAVAGGIO: And you've forgotten yours.
THE PATIENT: I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
CARAVAGGIO: I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
OFFICER: Do you remember where you were born?
THE PATIENT: Am I being interrogated? You should be trying to trick me. Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur. Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted. Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
OFFICER: Why? Are you German?
THE PATIENT: How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
OFFICER: How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
THE PATIENT: You tell me. I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
OFFICER: This was your garden?
THE PATIENT: Or my wife's.
OFFICER: Then you were married?
THE PATIENT: I think so. Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water? Hana pours him a glass of water. He notices her.
THE PATIENT: Thank you. Look - my lungs are useless - his fingers ) I've got this much lung.the rest of my organs are packing up - what could it possibly matter if I were Tutankhamun? I'm a bit of toast, my friend - butter me and slip a poached egg on top. Hana leaves, smiling at the Patient's irascibility, sharing this with the Officer, who frowns. The interview continues.
STUART: My leave is canceled. I can't meet you later. Hana frowns, helpless. As if to emphasize this, a Staff Nurse comes by, carrying a bowl and a withering look.
HANA: Excuse me -
THE PATIENT: Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
HANA: Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
THE PATIENT: Your friend?
HANA: He's going back to the front this evening. I can't see him otherwise.
THE PATIENT: Just go off. I'll be quite all right.
HANA: No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
THE PATIENT: Well then - yes. Of course.
HANA: Thank you. Thank you. She hurries out, returns with Stuart. They stand awkwardly.
HANA: This is Captain McGann.
THE PATIENT: Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
STUART: THE PATIENT I'm going to sing. If I sing I shan't hear anything. And with that he bursts into a raucous, coughing version of Yes! We Have No Bananas. He changes language each verse. The couple stand, formal, then edge round to the back of the bed.
THE PATIENT: I'm going to sing. If I sing I shan't hear anything. And with that he bursts into a raucous, coughing version of Yes! We Have No Bananas. He changes language each verse. The couple stand, formal, then edge round to the back of the bed.
HANA: ( touching his lip ) You've got a mustache.
STUART: A bit of one.
HANA: I was looking forward to this evening.
STUART: ( whispers ) I had a hotel room.
HANA: ( whispers ) I thought that was for when we were very very old?
STUART: I'm feeling old. They EMBRACE, fiercely, hardly making a sound, or moving. THE PATIENT
CARAVAGGIO: Hana calls after him.
HANA: Where've you been?
CARAVAGGIO: ( not stopping ) Rabbit hunting. Hana looks at the rabbit. She's angry. Caravaggio hasn't been around for a week.
HANA: I could help you. I could get you off that.
CARAVAGGIO: Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life? She bends, starts clearing up, putting the morphine phials back into the box.
HANA: It's a week. We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
CARAVAGGIO: ( of the drugs ) You should be happy. What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
HANA: What do you do? What are you doing here?
CARAVAGGIO: Some gave me a dress. You know what's great? What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
THE PATIENT: Something smells so rich. My stomach is heaving -
HANA: He came back, he says he caught a rabbit. I'm cooking it.
THE PATIENT: That's a different dress.
HANA: He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him? Do you recognize him?
THE PATIENT: Do I recognize him? I recognize what he is. I like him. He's Canadian. He can read Italian. He can catch rabbits.
KATHARINE: ( diffident ) Hello. Not to interrupt but we're celebrating. She makes to leave but Almásy puts up a hand to keep Katharine there, but quiet.
ALMÁSY: This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich. I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
KATHARINE: What do you mean, poetry?
ALMÁSY: A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
KATHARINE: Sounds perfectly clear. Where does the Ostrich come in?
ALMÁSY: The Ostrich is a detour. A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method. Nothing to do with Zerzura. To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move. The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run. At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards. When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer. Haunting the ostrich. The Guide speaks, amplifying something, picking at his robe.
ALMÁSY: Yes, the ostrich, it will feed a family, not just the meat, but by selling the feathers, beak, the skin, a year from this one animal. So, each day the man gets closer. And the ostrich is not sure - has something changed? - now the standing man is only a few yards from where it feeds. And then one day, the man is in the wadi, in the water. And the Ostrich comes, as always, dips into the water and the man JUMPS UP - and captures it. He shrugs. The Arab has more to say. Almásy doesn't respond, quieting him with a dismissive gesture.
KATHARINE: What is he saying? Come on, what did he say?
ALMÁSY: He said - be careful.
KATHARINE: Be careful? You mean you - or me? Who?
ALMÁSY: ( to the Arab ) Her or me? The Arab speaks again. Almasy speaks without looking at her.
ALMÁSY: The one who appears not to be moving.
CLIFTON: Gentlemen, to Zerzura.
ALL: And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund-raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
MADOX: And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund-raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
CLIFTON: To arm-twisting.
MADOX: ( to Almásy ) Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
CLIFTON: Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
KATHARINE: Darling, Peter says I could stay.
MADOX: ( checking with Almásy ) Why not?
ALMÁSY: What kind of photographs?
CLIFTON: Portraits. The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
KATHARINE: ( to Clifton ) Why do you think? About my staying?
CLIFTON: Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft.
KATHARINE: ( playfully poking his ribs ) But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
CLIFTON: But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
ALMÁSY: Safe journey.
CLIFTON: You too. Good luck!
ALMÁSY: Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
CLIFTON: I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
ALMÁSY: I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
CLIFTON: Are you mad? Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
ALMÁSY: All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
CLIFTON: I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife. I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her. I think she's know herself.
ALMÁSY: Very well.
CLIFTON: ( laughing it off ) Why are you people so threatened by a woman?! He settles into the controls. Almásy watches the plane taxi away. Doesn't move at all. Katharine waves from the tent as the Steerman takes off. 65a. EXT. BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL. The THREE FORD CARS leave the campsite, loaded for a scouting expedition. The rest of the party, Bedouin, tents, camels and Tiger Moth is left behind. Madox shouts last-minute instructions from the window of his car.
KATHARINE: I've been thinking about - how does somebody like you decide to come to the desert? What is it? You're doing whatever you're doing - in your castle, or wherever it is you live, and one day, you say, I have to go to the desert - or what? Almásy doesn't answer. Katharine, who has looked at him for an answer, looks away. There's another long silence.
ALMÁSY: I once traveled with a terrific guide, who was taking me to Faya. He didn't speak for nine hours. At the end of it he pointed at the horizon and said - Faya! That was a good day! Point made, they lapse again into silence. Katharine boils.
KATHARINE: Actually, you sing.
ALMÁSY: You sing. All the time.
KATHARINE: You sing. All the time.
ALMÁSY: I do not.
KATHARINE: Ask Al Auf. Almásy asks Al Auf in Arabic. He laughs, nods.
KATHARINE: ( sings wickedly ) I'll be down to get you in the taxi, honey, you'd better be ready about half-past eight.! Al Auf nods and grins furiously, joins in, impersonating Almásy. Almásy grunts in irritation.
AL AUF: Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar. The westerners wait respectfully. As the sun sets in glory, Almásy looks over at the range of rocks. One particular range seems to look exactly like A WOMAN'S BACK. He squints at the rock. Almásy discreetly pulls out his COMPASS.
ALMÁSY: Madox! Madox! He slithers in a heap in front of the astonished expedition party. Doesn't care.
MADOX: ( with audible excitement ) My God, they're swimming! The others crowd round. FIVE EXCITED FACES IN THE GREEN GLOOM OF THE
D'AGOSTINO: Have you seen this? Astonishing. Perfectly preserved.
BERMANN: I love the desert, you see. That's my, that's my - I can't think of the word. How do you explain? To someone who's never been here? Feelings which seem quite normal.
ALMÁSY: ( compassionate ) I don't know, my friend. I don't know. Bermann holds out another segment of the orange, and watches the slim brown hand collect it. A MOMENTARY DISTRACTION IS ALL IT TAKES FOR HIM
MADOX: I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
ALMÁSY: Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
MADOX: ( nods at Almásy, then shouts over to the wrecked vehicles ) This is Bermann's cue to take leave of Kamal who is staying behind. Kamal makes a little bow.
KAMAL: May God make safety your companion. Bermann nods and hurries away, squeezing into the car which jolts off, bouncing over the track.
KATHARINE: I shall stay behind, of course
MADOX: Certainly not.
KATHARINE: I insist. There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts. Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic. Almásy shrugs. LATER - THE MADOX CAR makes a more effective departure. And Almasy and Katharine are left alone. THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER as if realizing this for the first time. Almasy immediately returns to the two damaged vehicles and helps the men stretch the cut canvas which was once a tent TO FASHION A MAKESHIFT SHELTER BETWEEN THE TWO CARS. Katharine goes to join them. There is no obstacle to the remorseless horizon, just miles of undulating dunes.
ALMÁSY: What's this?
KATHARINE: I thought you might paste them into your book.
ALMÁSY: We took several photographs, there's no need.
KATHARINE: I'd like you to have them.
ALMÁSY: ( handing them back ) There's really no need. This is just a scrapbook. I should feel obliged. Thank you.
KATHARINE: ( exasperated ) And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes. Of course it would. She's already turning, walking as far from him as the cramped shelter permits. He continues with his maps.
ALMÁSY: You should come into the shelter.
KATHARINE: I'm quite all right, thank you.
ALMÁSY: Look over there. Katharine turns, scans the horizon.
KATHARINE: What am I looking at?
ALMÁSY: See what's happening to them - the stars.
KATHARINE: They're so untidy. I'm just trying to rearrange them.
ALMÁSY: In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand. He offers a hand. A little reluctantly she takes it.
KATHARINE: This is not very good, is it?
ALMÁSY: Shall we be all right?
KATHARINE: Shall we be all right?
ALMÁSY: Yes. Absolutely.
KATHARINE: Yes is a comfort. Absolutely is not.
ALMÁSY: Which Mariners called the sea of darkness. Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
#NAME?: Which Mariners called the sea of darkness. Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
KATHARINE: Fiction. We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on. More.
ALMÁSY: All true. Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
KATHARINE: Our tracks, where are they? Almásy is preoccupied. He's gone back to their vehicle and returns with a shovel, STARTS TO DIG FRANTICALLY.
ALMÁSY: Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
KATHARINE: ( realizing what he's doing ) Oh my God, the others! She kneels with him and helps to shovel away the sand WHICH HAS COMPLETELY ENGULFED THE OTHER VEHICLE containing the three Bedouin.
ALMÁSY: ( during this ) Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book? I should like to have them. I should be honored.
KATHARINE: Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
ALMÁSY: ( shoveling hard ) Water? Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical. ( anxious at not uncovering the boys, egging himself on ) Come on, come on! ( then back to Katharine ) There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
KATHARINE: Find that plant. Cut out its heart. They hear NOISES, scrabbling, faint thumps. Almásy scrapes at the sand and they find the glass of the car. The angle of the cab, tilted up to the sky, has made it impossible for the trapped boys to lever it open. Their oxygen is rapidly deteriorating. Almásy pulls the door and it cranks open.
ALMÁSY: Kamal is passing blood. He must have had some internal damage in the crash. He needs medicine. I think we must risk the other flare. He gets up and loads the flare with what is clearly the last charge. This time the effect is dramatic with A RED UMBRELLA OF LIGHT. Katharine comes up beside him. They wait, hope fading with the flare.
KATHARINE: ( blank ) Geoffrey's not in Cairo. ( Almásy looks at her ) He's not actually a buffoon. And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government. They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia. In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
ALMÁSY: And the marriage - is that a fiction? There's a beat. Katharine has a hundred answers.
KATHARINE: No, the marriage isn't a fiction. The light from the flare fades on them and they stand in the dark. Suddenly on the far horizon, behind their heads, AN ANSWERING FLARE fireworks into the sky.
KATHARINE: Thank God. Oh, thank God. There's excited shouting from the two fit boys. They leap up and run towards the couple, who meanwhile have realized that the flare has not come from Madox, but from an approaching CAMEL CARAVAN. Almásy shouts to the boys for some identification.
KATHARINE: Do they know them?
ALMÁSY: ( squinting at the horizon ) No, but I think I do. The Caravan slowly comes into focus. IT'S FENELON-BARNES. Katharine touches Almásy's arm - an almost imperceptible gesture.
KATHARINE: Am I K. in your book? I think I must be. Almásy turns to her. He runs the blade of his arm across her neck - the sweat leaving a clear stripe. Fenelon-Barnes approaches, dismounts from his camel, and addresses I recollect your saying to ignore your bones but I assume you have no objection to my rescuing your Good evening, Mrs. Clifton.
KATHARINE: ( accepting his handshake ) I'd like to introduce you to my camel - the most notable beast on earth. ( to Almásy ) I understand you found some remarkable caves. A goatskin bag of water is offered to Katharine. She drinks and hands it to Almásy.
KATHARINE: Will you not come in?
ALMÁSY: Will you please come in?
KATHARINE: Will you please come in?
ALMÁSY: ( a beat ) Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
KATHARINE: I believe you still have my book. Katharine fishes the book from her knapsack, shoves it at him, then 94 INT. ALMÁSY'S ROOM. DAY. Almásy lying on a camp bed, face down. The walls are covered with maps, enlargements of photographs. A fan whirs over his kit which is spread, unraveled but ordered, on the stone floor. An ineffably male room, the shutters closed, just the thinnest shaft of light piercing the gloom. Almásy hasn't even removed his clothes, his boots kicked off below his jutting feet. There's A KNOCK at the door. Almásy sleeps. Another. A third. He's roused from the dead. Stumbles to his feet, opens the door as the knocking continues. It's Katharine. She's bathed, luminous, stands back-lit by the afternoon sun - an angel in a cotton dress. She walks past him into the room. He closes the door. She turns. He KNEELS before her, head at her thighs. She's crying, her face expressionless as her hands go to his head.
ALMÁSY: I believe you still have my book. Katharine fishes the book from her knapsack, shoves it at him, then 94 INT. ALMÁSY'S ROOM. DAY. Almásy lying on a camp bed, face down.

She's crying, her face expressionless as her hands go to his head.
KATHARINE: You still have sand in your hair. She starts to BEAT on his head and shoulders, violently. He pulls back, to look at her, the tears streaming down her face. She kneels and covers his face with kisses. He pulls blindly at her dress and it RIPS across her breasts.
KATHARINE: I'm impressed you can sew.
ALMÁSY: You sew very badly.
KATHARINE: You sew very badly.
ALMÁSY: You don't sew at all!
KATHARINE: A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it. Close your eyes.
ALMÁSY: ( laughs ) That makes it harder still. She pushes the sewing from his hands, then pours water over his head, then begins to shampoo his hair. Almásy is in heaven. The biggest smile we have seen from him. She continues to massage his scalp.
ALMÁSY: When were you most happy?
KATHARINE: When were you least happy?
ALMÁSY: When were you least happy?
KATHARINE: ( a beat ) Okay. And what do you love? Say everything.
ALMÁSY: Okay. And what do you love? Say everything.
KATHARINE: What do I love? I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths. She rinses his scalp, then slips off the robe and CLIMBS IN BESIDE HIM, covering his neck and shoulders in kisses.
ALMÁSY: What else?
KATHARINE: Marmite - addicted! Baths - not with other people! Islands. Your handwriting. I could go on all day. My husband. Almásy nods.
ALMÁSY: What do you hate most?
KATHARINE: A lie. What do you hate most?
ALMÁSY: Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you should forget me. She freezes, pulls herself away, out of the bath, looks at him, then SLAPS HIM VERY HARD across the face. She picks up her dress, the thread and needle dangling from it, and walks, dripping, out of the room.
THE PATIENT: Could I ask you to move? I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
HANA: ( mortified, moving quickly ) Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
HANA: I'm so sorry.
MARY: Okay, Type Os, the vampires wait. Everybody's giving a pint.
JAN: Ugh! If they were sucking it out I wouldn't mind. It's the needle I can't stand.
HANA: ( laughing ) You're a nurse - how ca you be frightened of needles!
WOUNDED SOLDIER: Can't wait to have me dead? You bitch! He slaps her hand away. Slaps at the tubes going into his arm. Hana is absolutely shocked. But just as suddenly he's sunk back into semi- Shaken, she sits by him and takes his hand, he pulls it away, she takes it again. He is in terrible pain. His face creased with anger. Now his hand is clutching at hers. She tries to soothe him.
HANA: Try t be calm. Ssssshhh. Come on. Be calm now. Ssshhhh. Be peaceful. It's okay. It's okay. HIS FACE STILLS. HIS HAND LOOSENS. Now he has gone. As Hana inspects him, a shell seems to land close by. THE LIGHTS FLICKER. She ducks, along with everyone else. Below the bed, on slatboards, above the mud, are the now dead soldier's possessions. They include A PAIR OF TENNIS SHOES.
CANADIAN SOLDIER: ( whispering to Oliver ) Is there anybody here from Picton?
OLIVER: Picton? I don't know.
CANADIAN SOLDIER: I'd like to see somebody from home before I go. Hana can only really hear Oliver's end of this conversation, but the mention of Canada chills her, and she knows, now, not later, that Stuart is dead.
HANA: ( to Oliver ) Why Picton?
OLIVER: He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier? The boy nods.
JAN: ( innocent ) Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
HANA: ( to Oliver ) As him what company he's with? Oliver leans over, then turns to Hana.
OLIVER: Third Canadian Fusiliers.
HANA: Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
CANADIAN SOLDIER: He bought it. Yesterday. Shot to bits. The shells are getting closer.
HANA: What did he say?
OLIVER: ( can't look at her ) Doesn't know him.
HANA: He's gone, hasn't he?
OLIVER: No. He's - no.
HANA: Oh God. Oh God. The shells pound them, incredibly loud, drowning out her grief, but each explosion illuminates it for a moment.
CARAVAGGIO: ( he touches her shoulder ) Hana? Are you alright?
HANA: ( without raising her head ) Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
CARAVAGGIO: ( soothing ) I'll have some of your water. It's hot. She reaches for her blouse, wraps it around herself. Her face is read with weeping.
CARAVAGGIO: ( gently ) You have to protect yourself from sadness. This is the thing I've learned. ( drinking the water ) You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient. Do you think he's a saint or something? Because of the way he looks? I don't think he is.
HANA: I'm not in love with him. I'm in love with ghosts. And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
CARAVAGGIO: Who are his ghosts?
HANA: Ask him.
CARAVAGGIO: ( he holds up his hands ) What if I told you he did this to me?
HANA: ( stung ) What? How could he have? When?
CARAVAGGIO: I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know. It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
HANA: I don't know what that means.
CARAVAGGIO: ( shrugs ) Ask him. Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
HANA: ( furious ) Please don't creep around this house.
HANA: Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace. New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire. I love that, I believe that. Who is K?
THE PATIENT: K is for Katharine.
ALMÁSY: Say you're sick.
KATHARINE: What? No!
ALMÁSY: Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
KATHARINE: ( but a frisson ) I can't work. I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
ALMÁSY: I can't work. I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
LADY HAMPTON: ( to Almásy ) I can't sleep. I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
KATHARINE: ( to Almásy ) I can't sleep. I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
ALMÁSY: I can still taste you.
KATHARINE: ( waving at another woman who pushes a trolley with teapots ) This is empty, just coming!
ALMÁSY: I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth. Swoon. I'll catch you. Almásy sits watching the party. The Santa Claus is dragged outside by some excited Children. Almásy picks at his cake removing the thick marzipan icing. He's writing on A CHRISTMAS CRACKER WRAPPER, smoothing it out - December 22nd. Betrayals in war are childlike compared with out betrayals du. Katharine, attending to a raucous table, suddenly sags at the knees, and SWOONS. People rush to her.
KATHARINE: I'm fine. How silly.
OFFICER'S WIFE: ( helping her to her feet ) It's the heat.
LADY HAMPTON: You should sit down, darling. She's quite all right. Are you pregnant?
KATHARINE: I don't think so.
LADY HAMPTON: ( squeezing her arm ) How romantic. With Fiona I fell over every five minutes. Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
KATHARINE: I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
LADY HAMPTON: I'll come with you.
KATHARINE: No, please. I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
CLIFTON: Have you seen Katharine?
ALMÁSY: ( taken aback ) It's Geoffrey under this.
CLIFTON: It's Geoffrey under this.
ALMÁSY: I haven't, no. Sorry. 106a. INT. SIDE ROOM IN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE. DAY. Geoffrey continues scouting the warren of tiny rooms that run off the central courtyard. He finds Katharine sitting in one, smoking, surrounded by oppressive and elaborate tiling. Clifton wonders briefly how Almásy had missed Katharine.
CLIFTON: Darling, I just heard. You poor sausage, are you all right?
KATHARINE: I'm fine. I got hot.
CLIFTON: Lady H said she thought you might be -
KATHARINE: I'm not pregnant. I'm hot. I'm too hot.
CLIFTON: Aren't you?
KATHARINE: Aren't you?
CLIFTON: ( taking off his hat and beard ) Come on, I'll take you home.
KATHARINE: Can't we really go home? I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow. If you wanted.
CLIFTON: Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
KATHARINE: ( poking at his costume ) Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
CLIFTON: I do so love you. What do you smell of?
KATHARINE: Marzipan! I think you've got marzipan in your hair. No wonder you're homesick.
CLIFTON: Marzipan! I think you've got marzipan in your hair. No wonder you're homesick.
THE PATIENT: Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in. Like an old boxer.
CARAVAGGIO: I can't hide anymore. I breathe like a dog. I lose my balance. Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
CARAVAGGIO: Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
THE PATIENT: I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage. It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face. Caravaggio comes close, scrutinizing the face, trying to repair the features. Exasperated.
CARAVAGGIO: Is it you? If I said Moose. I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
THE PATIENT: ( impassive ) ( a different tack ) First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
CARAVAGGIO: ( a different tack ) First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
THE PATIENT: I don't know. Paper. Is it? Paper? I don't remember.
THE PATIENT: I have come to love that little tap of the fingernail against the syringe. Tap.
HANA: Excuse me. Yes? I don't have the key to that door.
KIP: The Germans were here. The Germans were all over this area. They left mines everywhere. Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
HANA: I see. Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach. He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
KIP: Is something funny?
HANA: No, but, no, not at all. I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -
#NAME?: worried about mines. That's all.
KIP: I've met you before.
HANA: I don't think so. Hana bends to see what Kip's looking at under the piano. Wires run from the wall to the instrument onto which is taped an EXPLOSIVE CHARGE. If Hana had succeeded in moving the piano she would have triggered the charge. Kip looks at Hana who conceals her dismay with a 110a. EXT. THE MONASTERY GARDEN. DUSK. Across from the terrace, HARDY AND KIP ARE PUTTING UP THEIR TENTS. Caravaggio stands, chatting amiably to them, holding a haversack, smoking a cigarette.
HANA: He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him. He's Indian, he wears a turban.
THE PATIENT: Sikh. If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh. Kip glances up at the window. Hana, suddenly shy, backs away.
HANA: I'll probably marry him.
THE PATIENT: Really? That's sudden.
HANA: My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano. She goes over to the Patient's bed.
HANA: I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
THE PATIENT: Why? Is he staying?
HANA: With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy.
THE PATIENT: We should charge! Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
HANA: They have to clear all the local roads of mines. That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
THE PATIENT: In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
CLIFTON: ( into the phone ) Darling, it's me, I'm sorry, something's come up. ( Katharine responds ) Don't sulk - I'll be back tomorrow evening. I promise. ( Katharine responds ) Okay my precious, I love you. Rupert makes a face at his friend's sentimentality. Clifton beams.
RUPERT: I didn't know you were going anywhere?
CLIFTON: I'm not. I'm going to surprise her. It's our anniversary. She's forgotten, of course. What's the symbol for your first anniversary? I should get something. Is it paper? Moose! Moose, you there? First Anniversary - is it cotton?
CARAVAGGIO: Is what cotton?
CLIFTON: First Wedding Anniversary.
RUPERT: ( of Clifton ) He's hopeless!
CLIFTON: Your day will come, my sausage.
CARAVAGGIO: Your first anniversary is Paper.
CLIFTON: Stop here.
CABBIE: Stop here.
CLIFTON: Stop here.
CABBIE: Geoffrey sits in the cab. Fifty yards short of the hotel. The world rushes by. He finds a cigarette.
KATHARINE: This is - what is this?
ALMÁSY: It's a folk song.
KATHARINE: No, no, it's Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me.
ALMÁSY: No, no, it's Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me.
KATHARINE: ( as they listen ) It's beautiful. What's it about?
ALMÁSY: ( as if interpreting ) It's a long song - Szerelem means love.and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool. For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave. He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of - Katharine had thought for a few seconds he was serious, then she catches on and starts to beat him.
ALMÁSY: ( laughing ) Ouch! See - you're always beating me..!
KATHARINE: You bastard, I was believing you! They embrace, he lies over her, considering her naked back.
ALMÁSY: I claim this shoulder blade - oh no, wait - I want this! He turns her over, kisses her throat, then traces the hollow This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine! I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
ALMÁSY: This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine! I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
KATHARINE: ( teasing ) I thought we were against ownership? ( kissing him ) I can stay tonight. The luxury of this makes them both sad. The duplicity. Almásy rolls away on to his back.
ALMÁSY: Madox knows, I think. He's tried to warn me. He keeps talking about Anna Karenina. I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat. Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
KATHARINE: This is a different world - is what I tell myself. A different life. And here I am a different wife.
ALMÁSY: Yes. A different wife.
CLIFTON: Two or three CHILDREN knock on the window, begging. Geoffrey knocks back, violently. They disappear.
CABBIE: Hotel now, sir?
GEOFFREY: And he throws a silencing wad of money onto the seat by the Cabbie.
ALMÁSY: I don't care to bargain. It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
KATHARINE: That day, had you followed me to the market?
ALMÁSY: Of course. You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
KATHARINE: ( loving him, but frightened ) Shall we be all right?
ALMÁSY: Yes. Yes. 118 EXT. CAIRO STREET. DAWN. Katharine takes leave of Almásy on the street corner away from the hotel entrance. They don't kiss, there's no demonstration of feeling. He turns immediately away and disappears.
CARAVAGGIO: ( grinning ) Thought you'd never wake up!
THE PATIENT: Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
HANA: Where did you find that?
CARAVAGGIO: I liberated it.
HANA: I think that's called looting.
CARAVAGGIO: ( relaxed ) No-one should own music. The real question is who wrote the song?
THE PATIENT: Irving Berlin.
CARAVAGGIO: THE PATIENT Top Hat.
THE PATIENT: Top Hat.
CARAVAGGIO: Is there a song you don't know?
HANA: ( speaking for him ) No. He sings all the time. She goes over to the Patient and kisses him gently.
HANA: Good morning. Did you know that? You're always singing?
THE PATIENT: I've been told that before.
HANA: Kip's another one. She goes to the window, looks over to where the tents are pitched, sees Hardy shaving, Kip IN THE PROCESS OF WASHING HIS HAIR, his turban HANGING LIKE A RIBBON between two trees to dry. He's perched a bowl on the sundial and is dipping his long coal-black hair into it. As Hana watches Kip, Caravaggio changes the record. The Patient identifies it 121. EXT. MONASTERY GARDEN. MORNING. Hana walks past the tent, and passes Hardy. She's carrying a small cup, which she's a little furtive about. He's carrying a whole armada of OIL LIGHTS. He nods upstairs.
HANA: Hello miss.
HARDY: Hello miss.
HANA: I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever. you and Lieutenant Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
HARDY: Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
HANA: Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
HARDY: I'll ask the Lieutenant. But thank you.
HANA: You saved my life. I haven't forgotten. I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
HARDY: ( does a little mime ) A toddler She goes on, and tentatively approaches Kip, who's still working at his hair. Kip hears her and puts out an inquiring arm, moving towards her like a blink man through the curtain of hair. He touches her.
HANA: Sorry, is it all right I'm seeing this? Kip shrugs.
HANA: My hair was long. At some point. I've forgotten what a nuisance it is to wash. You know - if you were ever around - we get water from the pump at noon. He continues to wash. She holds up the cup of oil.
HANA: Try this. I found a great jar of it. Olive oil. In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
KIP: Thank you. She stands for a second, then walks away. Kip examines the oil, calls after her.
KIP: For my hair?
HANA: ( turning, smiling ) Yes, for your hair.
KIP: Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
THE PATIENT: natives called the Lahore Museum.
#NAME?: natives called the Lahore Museum.
KIP: It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
THE PATIENT: So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
KIP: What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk. And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
THE PATIENT: Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
HANA: Arguing about books.
THE PATIENT: Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
KIP: ( grinning, leaving ) I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
HANA: I didn't like that book either. It's all about men. Too many men. Just like this house.
THE PATIENT: You like him, don't you? Your voice changes.
HANA: I don't think it does. Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
THE PATIENT: I don't think it's indifference. Kip comes bounding in with a fresh can.
THE PATIENT: Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
HANA: ( appalled ) Hey! -
THE PATIENT: Well, I'm indifferent to cooking, not Hana's cooking in particular. Have either of you ever tried condensed milk sandwiches?
#NAME?: Well, I'm indifferent to cooking, not Hana's cooking in particular. Have either of you ever tried condensed milk sandwiches?
KIP: Well, I'm indifferent to cooking, not Hana's cooking in particular. Have either of you ever tried condensed milk sandwiches?
THE PATIENT: ( no irony ) Careful - careful! 127a. EXT. THE MONASTERY GARDEN. MORNING. The storm tour includes a trip around the pond. The Patient pushes away the umbrella, lets the rain drench him. He grins at Hana.
THE PATIENT: This is wonderful!
KIP: ( to Hana ) What's he saying?
HANA: He's saying it's wonderful!
MADOX: ( pushing away his charts ) And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
ALMÁSY: No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple! Look! What is that? Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility.
MADOX: Which we've overflown twice.
ALMÁSY: Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy. And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura. Other readers look over at this unseemly skirmish.
MADOX: So - on Thursday you don't trust Bell's map - Bell was a fool, Bell couldn't draw a map, but on Friday he's suddenly infallible? Almásy is surprised by Madox' anger.
MADOX: And where are the Expedition Maps?
ALMÁSY: In my room.
MADOX: Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government. They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
ALMÁSY: What's the matter with you?
MADOX: Don't be so bloody naïve. You know there's a war breaking out. the map, recites its message ) This arrived this morning. By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
ALMÁSY: Why do they care about our maps?
MADOX: What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears. In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
ALMÁSY: ( contemptuous ) Own the desert. Almásy hesitates at a junction, clearly about to take leave of Madox.
ALMÁSY: That place at the base of a woman's throat? You know - the hollow - here - does that have an official name? Madox looks at him.
MADOX: For God's sake, man - pull yourself together.
SOLDIER: Beggin your pardon, miss, but have you got a lighter? Katharine lights his cigarette and returns to the screen. An item about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and TOP HAT. The stars do their stuff. The soldier moves a seat nearer.
SOLDIER: ( leering ) I love Ginger, she's a foxy girl, ain't she?
KATHARINE: Fuck off.
SOLDIER: You heard me. The Soldier slinks off, muttering. Katharine is wretched. She sits head down, not watching the screen, marooned in her despair about duplicity, sordid assignations. Almásy arrives, slides in beside Katharine, his shadow momentarily large across the screen.
KATHARINE: You heard me. The Soldier slinks off, muttering. Katharine is wretched. She sits head down, not watching the screen, marooned in her despair about duplicity, sordid assignations. Almásy arrives, slides in beside Katharine, his shadow momentarily large across the screen.
ALMÁSY: They watch the screen. Katharine is weeping. Almásy doesn't understand. He puts his arm around her.
KATHARINE: I can't do this, I can't do this any more.
KATHARINE: I'd better get back. Say goodbye here.
ALMÁSY: I'm not agreeing. Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not. They stand, awkward. Katharine rehearses her position. The bell I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
KATHARINE: I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
ALMÁSY: Don't go over it again, please. He takes her hands, lays his cheeks into them, then releases them, gets up, walks away. She walks towards the gate. He calls after her.
ALMÁSY: Katharine - He walks towards her, his smile awful.
ALMÁSY: I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
KATHARINE: You will. You will. Then she turns sharply from him and catches her head against the gatepost, staggers at the shock of it, then hurries away.
THE PATIENT: I'm still here.
HANA: You'd better be.
THE PATIENT: Don't depend on it. Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right. She squeezes his hand, suddenly overwhelmed.
THE PATIENT: ( brightly ) I've been talking to Caravaggio - my research assistant - there's meant to be a ghost in the Cloisters. I can join him! There's some kind of noise from the garden. Muffled shouts.
THE PATIENT: It's the boy. Hana goes to the window, opens the shutters. The day pours in.
KIP: Go to the left! Keep to the left! There are mines and trip wires everywhere! Hana stops, hoists up her skirt and circles left, tentative in the long grass. He shouts, doesn't want her close.
KIP: Get Hardy. He's on the other side of town. In the hills. Get him to hurry. She keeps coming, can see that he needs her.
HANA: It's okay - I'll help. Please.
KIP: The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
HANA: What do I do?
KIP: There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance. I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
HANA: So I follow the wires?
KIP: You get Hardy.
HANA: I follow the wires. She kneels at his feet and tries to trace the tangled route of the web.
KIP: Don't touch them. She follows one wire back to the closest mine, and traces another back to Kip's foot. Then she finds another one leading off to a second mine some thirty metres away.
HANA: Why would anyone do this?
KIP: I've done this. I've had to do this. Then Hana's suddenly tense.
HANA: Give me a second. She turns and tiptoes RIGHT THROUGH THE DANGER AREA, straight to what had seized her attention. Kip is appalled.
KIP: What are you doing?! Hana! Heedless, she dodges another mine and its web of wires just as THE TORTOISE clambers onto a clump of rock, which is, in fact, ANOTHER
KIP: What is this business with you and explosives? Do you think you're immune?
HANA: I promise you that was the right thing to do. He's my good luck. and hands them to him ) Now cut. This one. I hope we don't die.
KIP: Okay. Get away from here. Quick.
HANA: I'm not scared. So many people have died around me. But I would be a shame for us. I don't feel like being shy.
KIP: You must get away. Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling. He's going to topple over if he cuts.
HANA: Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over. Give me the pliers.
KIP: But he hands them over.
HANA: Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case.
KIP: Don't talk. Check again. Lie flat and then cut. Hana checks, lies down. He bends as close to the ground as he dares
THE PATIENT: Hana! Hana! Kip! Hana! He tries to move. He can't. He's frantic. FOOTSTEPS, as someone hurtles up the stairs. It's Hana. She's ashamed to have forgotten him. She rushes to him.
HANA: I'm sorry. I forgot you'd be worrying. We're all safe. It was a mine, but not the mine. Nobody's hurt. I'm sorry. She calms him. He's exhausted. His eyes shine.
SOLDIER: And you're definitely traveling with him of your own free will?
HANA: ( clearly disapproving ) Just wanting to be sure. And he's taking you to church?
SOLDIER: ( clearly disapproving ) Just wanting to be sure. And he's taking you to church?
HANA: ( deadpan ) Yes. We're going to a funeral. A cow has died. And in his religion they're sacred. The Soldier isn't sure what to make of this. He signals to his companion who returns Kip's papers. Kip walks back to the motorcycles. He says nothing. He kicks the starter. Hana gets on, slides her arms lovingly around him.
HANA: He runs up the sandbags, right up into the rafters. He collects the other end of the rope which is attached to Hana. Holding onto it, he just STEPS OFF INTO THE DARKNESS. SIMULTANEOUSLY HANA IS SWUNG UP INTO THE AIR, her startled yelp echoing around the Church. Kip touches ground, while Hana swings through space, coming to rest about three feet from the FRESCOED WALLS, painted by Piero Della Francesca. Hana's flare makes a halo around her head. Now Kip, on the ground, still holding the rope, walks forward and causes Hana to SWING to the right. She lets out a giddy laugh, exhilarated and nervous, and she flies, illuminating - en passant - faces, bodies, angels. Kip guides the rope as if they were making love, which in a way they are. Hana arrives, hovering, in front of THE QUEEN OF SHEBA TALKING TO SOLOMON. She's overwhelmed. She reaches out to touch the giant neck of the sad Queen. Kip slowly lets her down, paying out the length of the rope. Hana's face is full of tears. He smiles, holds her.
THE PATIENT: There was a general who wore a patch over a perfectly good eye. The men fought harder for him. Sometimes I think I could get up and dance. What's under your bandages? Caravaggio goes to him, holding out his hands, the bandage ends Hold the ends. The Patient holds them. Caravaggio walks backwards, the bandages unraveling and unraveling.
CARAVAGGIO: Hold the ends. The Patient holds them. Caravaggio walks backwards, the bandages unraveling and unraveling.
AICHA: He's waiting for you. Some doors are open, revealing men and women in uniform urgently SHREDDING DOCUMENTS. Caravaggio knocks at an office whose door is ajar and where the incumbent, FENELON-BARNES, is stripping the room of his personal possessions- photographs, stone branches, a cricket bat. 142a. INT. FENELON-BARNES OFFICE. BHQ. TOBRUK. DAY. Caravaggio enters.
CARAVAGGIO: We have 30, 000 troops in Tobruk. What are they going to be doing?
MÜLLER: ( in German ) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. He slams down the phone and comes back to the table.
MÜLLER: David Caravaggio.
CARAVAGGIO: Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
MÜLLER: Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
CARAVAGGIO: ( barely with humor ) I keep explaining. You've got the wrong man. My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini. Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you. Müller doesn't even pay attention, he's going through a file. Pulls out some photographs, starts spreading them out.
MÜLLER: Is this you?
CARAVAGGIO: I don't know.
MÜLLER: It is you. This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41. And this -February 42.
CARAVAGGIO: It's impossible. I was buying or selling something. I've been to Cairo many times.
MÜLLER: You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies. Code-name Moose. THE PHONE rings again, is answered. The Clerk calls to Müller who gets up, irritably. Caravaggio addresses the room.
CARAVAGGIO: Could I have a doctor? I am passing blood. I must be bleeding internally. Can you get a doctor? Look - there's blood in his mouth ) I'm leaking blood. He kicks me. He kicks me all the time. Nobody responds. Müller is irascible on the phone, checking his watch, negotiating time. The call finishes.
CLERK: ( in German ) He's asking for a doctor.
MÜLLER: ( to Caravaggio ) You want a doctor?
CARAVAGGIO: Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
MÜLLER: We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
CARAVAGGIO: A nurse? Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse? Great. Müller nods at the Clerk, who instantly gets up. Just then the telephone rings again. He hesitates.
MÜLLER: ( in German ) Leave it and get the nurse! The Clerk exits. The phone rings. The Stenographer is plagued by flies. Suddenly he slaps at one.
MÜLLER: ( snapping ) Why is there so much nose? I can't hear myself think! ( turns to Caravaggio ) Look - give me something. So we can all get out of this room. A name. A code. ( wiping his face ) It's too hot.
CARAVAGGIO: I slept with the girl. I've got a wife in Tripoli. A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble. The NURSE comes in. She is Arab and her head is covered.
MÜLLER: I'll tell you what I'm going to do. This is your nurse, by the way. She's Moslem, so she'll understand all of this. What's the punishment for adultery? Let's leave it at that. You're married and you were fucking another woman, so that's - is it the hands that are cut off? Or is that for stealing? Does anyone know? There's silence. Müller turns to Caravaggio.
MÜLLER: Well, you must know. You were brought up Libya, yes?
CARAVAGGIO: Don't cut me.
MÜLLER: Or was it Toronto?
CARAVAGGIO: ( ashen ) Don't cut me. Come on. Now the phone starts again. The CLERK picks it up, there's a terse exchange, he puts the receiver on the desk, waits for the moment to interrupt Müller.
MÜLLER: Ten fingers. How about this? You give me a name for every finger - doesn't matter who. I get something, you keep something. I'm trying to be reasonable. Fenelon-Barnes, we could call that two names. Are thumbs fingers? Is a thumb a finger? No response. Müller opens his palms to Caravaggio.
MÜLLER: I get no help from these people.
CLERK: ( in German ) The telephone - Müller walks over, takes the receiver and slams it down. an AIR RAID SIREN is going off somewhere, and now the faint sound of explosions is also discernible, but all muffled in this room with the steady clack- clack of the STENOGRAPHER. At that moment, Müller suddenly becomes aware of what is happening. He turns on the Stenographer.
MÜLLER: ( in German ) What are you doing?
STENOGRAPHER: ( awkward, in German ) That Geneva Convention. I'm - Müller peremptorily rips out the paper, throws it on the floor.
CARAVAGGIO: You can't do that! Hey - come on! DURING THIS Müller's gone to the table, pulled out a drawer and produced A CUT-THROAT RAZOR. He hands it to the nurse, makes a line across his own left thumb and jerks his head towards Caravaggio. The nurse is extremely reluctant. Müller claps his hands, pushes her towards Caravaggio.
MÜLLER: Go! Hey! Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
CARAVAGGIO: Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Christ. The guards come away from the door and press down on Caravaggio's shoulders to prevent him from moving. The nurse, grim-faced, approaches, kneels at the table.
CARAVAGGIO: ( as she prepares to cut ) Listen, I'll give you a name. What name did you say? I knew them! I promise. Please - please! And then he SCREAMS AND SCREAMS and jerks up, carrying the guards and the table with him, all heaving off the ground, the nurse thrown off balance. He falls to the floor, ROARING WITH PAIN, blood everywhere, the table on top of him. The AIR RAID is continuing outside, the PHONE IS RINGING, the nurse stands, pale, blood all over her uniform.
MÜLLER: Cut the other thumb. He stabs at his own right thumb.
MÜLLER: This one! Come on! The nurse, horrified, shakes her head. Müller snatches the razor from her and heads towards the prostate Caravaggio. One Guard has got to his feet and grips Caravaggio around the neck in half-nelson, others holding his legs, while Müller approaches. Caravaggio can't move. He's gurgling as the Guard almost strangles him. His eyes are streaming with tears. Now Müller is at his other hand, and the ROAR of pain again lifts Caravaggio to his feet, THE WHOLE TABLE RISING IN THE AIR, his mutilated hands slipping from the handcuffs lie Houdini, the drawers of the table SPILLING their contents everywhere, before he sinks to his knees like a gored bull and BLACKS OUT.
CARAVAGGIO: The man who took my thumbs, I found him eventually - he's dead. The man who took my photograph, I found him too - that took me a year. He's dead. Another man took that man across the desert to Cairo. Now I intend to find him. The LIGHTS FROM THE MOTORBIKE approaching the Monastery, its growl. Caravaggio goes to the window and watches as Kip and Hana arrive.
ALMÁSY: I believe I'm rather late.
MADOX: ( ignoring the drama of this entrance ) Good, we're all here? A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
THE OTHERS: The International Sand Club!
ALMÁSY: ( raising his glass ) Misfits, buggers, fascists, and paedophiles. God bless us every one. The others drink, trying to ignore his mood.
ALMÁSY: Oops! Mustn't say International. Dirty word. Filthy word. His Majesty! Die Führer! Il Duce.
CLIFTON: Sorry, what's your point?
ALMÁSY: ( ignoring the remark ) And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding? The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials. ( to an embarrassed Fouad ) - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood. ( to his host, Sir Hampton ) Isn't that right? Ronnie Hampton shrugs. They're all very uncomfortable. Almásy glares at Clifton.
ALMÁSY: What's my point? Oh! I've invented a new dance - the Bosphorus Hug. Anybody up to it? Madox? D'Ag? Come on D'Aggers.
D'AGOSTINO: Let's eat first. Sit down. The Band is now playing Manhattan - Almásy, without missing a beat, begins to sing, replacing the words with alternatives he knows. He lurches around. Katharine can't look at him.
ALMÁSY: .We'll bathe at Brighton, the fish we'll frighten when we're in. your bathing suit so thin will make the shellfish grin, fin to fin. Those were the words - actually - before they were cleaned up. Could be a song for you, Mrs. Clifton -
#NAME?: Madox gets up and pulls Almásy into his chair, taking charge.
MADOX: Look, either shut up, or go home.
ALMÁSY: ( darkly ) Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
ALMÁSY: Why did you hold his collar?
KATHARINE: ( mimicking her inflection ) What? What? That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
ALMÁSY: ( mimicking her inflection ) What? What? That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
KATHARINE: Would you let me pass?
ALMÁSY: Is he next? Do you drag him into your little room? Where is it? Is this it?
KATHARINE: Don't do this.
ALMÁSY: I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there? How can you ever smile? As if your life hadn't capsized?
KATHARINE: You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
ALMÁSY: Dance with me.
KATHARINE: Dance with me. I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
ALMÁSY: Dance with me. I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
KATHARINE: Do you think you're the only one who feels anything? Is that what you think? Some women, flushed with dancing, turn the corner on the way to the Ladies Room. They collect Katharine in their train and leave Almásy to fall back into the shadows.
THE PATIENT: Why don't you go? You should sleep.
HANA: Would you like me to? He nods. She gets up, touches his hand, then leaves.
HANA: ( happy ) And he goes to her.
HARDY: I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
HANA: He's sleeping.
HARDY: Only we have to go to work.
HANA: I'll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine?
HARDY: A bomb. At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
HANA: Does he have to go?
HARDY: Pardon me?
HANA: What if you couldn't find him.? Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning. Kip comes to the door, winding his turban.
KIP: What's happening? Am I needed?
HARDY: I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent. Hana follows him.
HANA: Don't go. I'm frightened. I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
KIP: This is what I do. I do this every day. And he's ready, Hardy having wheeled out their motorcycles. He gets on his, and they're away, Hana hardly able to look.
KIP: Serial number - KK-1P2600. He's hypnotized by the number: KK-1P: a bomb with his name on it.
KIP: Hardy! Hardy! What's happening?!
HARDY: Corporal!? Dade!!
DADE: Tanks, sir. Don't know what it's about. God only knows.
HARDY: ( incredulous ) What is this - a bloody carnival? Stop them! Three Sappers run across the bridge towards the oncoming procession. They wave their orange flags, the tanks wave back wit their flags - Stars and Stripes, Union Jacks. Now SHOTS are ringing out. In the shaft, oblivious, Kip slides out from under the bomb, the oxygen spurting everywhere, all over his clothes, hissing on the surface of the water. Hardy bends into the shaft, heedless of his own safety.
HARDY: You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
KIP: Go away.
HARDY: This is making me incredibly angry. He rubs his hands to warm them up, locates his needle pliers and slips them through the tiny gap. His hand touches the casing and the freeze BURNS his hand. He jerks back, DROPPING THE PLIERS into the sludge, Now he's on his hands and knees in the sludge, trying frantically to find the pliers. Hardy looks at his watch, he can't help. The seconds run out as Kip grovels in the mud. Totally submerged, he suddenly comes out with the pliers, goes straight to the fuse, no finesse, and cuts. There's a snip. Then nothing. Then Kip laughs at Hardy.
KIP: This is making me incredibly angry. He rubs his hands to warm them up, locates his needle pliers and slips them through the tiny gap. His hand touches the casing and the freeze BURNS his hand. He jerks back, DROPPING THE PLIERS into the sludge, Now he's on his hands and knees in the sludge, trying frantically to find the pliers. Hardy looks at his watch, he can't help. The seconds run out as Kip grovels in the mud. Totally submerged, he suddenly comes out with the pliers, goes straight to the fuse, no finesse, and cuts. There's a snip. Then nothing. Then Kip laughs at Hardy.
KIP: Kiss me. Hardy is already at the winch, hauling it up. Kip can hardly clip on the halter - his hands numb and burned. As the pulley jerks he just clings on, rising from the grip of the mud like an ancient corpse out of a bog. The other sappers have gathered around the edge of the site. Great elation on their faces.
HARDY: Get a blanket! Dade! Get the Lieutenant a blanket.
DADE: It's over, Sarge. It's over. Jerry's surrendered. Sir, congratulations! Kip shakes his hand. Kip shakes Hardy's hand.
KIP: And now they're all shaking hands, and slapping backs and the SOLDIERS FROM THE TANKS are there and the victory celebrations begin. Kip's blank, drained, not taking anything in, as Dade wraps a blanket around his shoulders. HANA'S ON TOP OF THE VIADUCT, watching as Kip is wrapped in his blanket, the men celebrating. She shouts with relief from the top of the bridge.
HANA: 164 INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. NIGHT. The gramophone plays Frank Sinatra. Kip sits in the window, the shutters open, the village lit up behind his head, nodding to the music, sucking out of his condensed milk. Elsewhere there is an open bottle of cognac, some wine. The Patient has a beaker of wine. Caravaggio is dancing with Hana.
HANA: Kip - come and dance with me
KIP: ( a sly wobble of the head ) Yes. Later. Caravaggio swirls past the Patient - nodding at the cognac.
CARAVAGGIO: Have a drink.
THE PATIENT: I've had a drink. Fatal.
CARAVAGGIO: Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
THE PATIENT: Very true!
THE PATIENT: Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
HANA: Never heard of it.
THE PATIENT: That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
CARAVAGGIO: ( cryptic ) What? You and Madox? Or you and Katharine Clifton?
THE PATIENT: ( a small laugh ) There's a muddled thud in the distance, Kip's ears prick up. He glances for an instant out of the window.
HANA: ( anxious, of the noise ) What was that? She is spinning with Caravaggio. When she comes round again, Kip has 167 EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE. ITALY 1945. NIGHT. Kip's motorbike skids into the tiny PIAZZA. A MILITARY AMBULANCE IS ALREADY THERE. Dade and SPALDING are presiding as the paramedics take two bodies into the rear of the truck. The shattered fountain, the sluiced flagstones, shining wet and slick, give some clues as to what's happened, as do the elderly standing in the shadows, the distressed girls, arm in arm. ONE GIRL, young and quite striking, is particularly inconsolable, her grief sobbed out at the doors of the ambulance. SPALDING salutes Kip, who waves his salute away, just wanting to know what happened.
SPALDING: Booby trap. They was running up the Union Jack, sir, up off that statue - It just went off.
DADE: Should have been me. It was my idea but Sergeant Hardy climbed up, sir, him and Blackler. Kip goes to the ambulance. Spalding tries to stop him.
SPALDING: Sir - you don't want to look. Kip steps into the back of the ambulance, bends over both bodies, does look, then comes out, past the weeping girl.
KIP: Who's that girl?
DADE: His fiancee, sir.
KIP: ( astonished ) Kept it a bit dark.
DADE: Kept it a bit dark.
KIP: I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some - he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean - and us - he never once. He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
HANA: You loved him.
HANA: If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
KIP: I try not to expect you.
HANA: But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
KIP: Then I'd think there must be a reason.
HANA: You wouldn't come to find me? That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
HANA: Then I tell myself he spends all day searching, in the night he wants to be found.
MADOX: Had a letter from my wife. The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to. She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever. Wrong coast I should have thought, still.
ALMÁSY: Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow. I'm going to do what I can, but. And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
MADOX: Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow. I'm going to do what I can, but. And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
ALMÁSY: I told you so.
MADOX: We didn't care about countries. Did we? Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans. None of that mattered, did it? It was something finer than that.
ALMÁSY: Yes. It was. Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
MADOX: ( shrugging this off ) When's Clifton picking you up?
ALMÁSY: Tomorrow afternoon. Don't worry. I'll be ready.
MADOX: I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis. So if you need it.hard to know how long one's talking about. We might all be back in a month or two. Madox kneels and takes A HANDFUL OF SAND, puts it into his pocket. He throws his haversack into the plane then turns. Almásy puts out a hand. This is a moment of great emotional weight for them both, conducted as if nothing were happening.
MADOX: I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything. Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
ALMÁSY: Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
MADOX: May God make safety your companion.
ALMÁSY: ( a tradition ) There is no God. ( smiles ) But I hope someone looks after you. Madox clambers into his plane, then remembers something, jabs at his In case you're still wondering - this is called the supasternal notch. Almásy nods, goes to the propeller.
MADOX: In case you're still wondering - this is called the supasternal notch. Almásy nods, goes to the propeller.
MADOX: Come and visit us in Dorset. When all this nonsense is over. You'll never come to Dorset. The plane roars into life. Almásy watches it taxi away - then heads back to continue with his packing up.
HANA: Sometimes I need you to find me.
THE PATIENT: Hana tells me you're leaving.
CARAVAGGIO: ( preparing the injection ) There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
THE PATIENT: We shall miss you. He delivers the injection. The Patient sighs. Caravaggio takes off his jacket. A pistol is stuck in his waistband. The Patient sees it.
CARAVAGGIO: So, I come across the Hospital Convoy I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat - using his teeth grip the sleeve ) how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -
#NAME?: full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
THE PATIENT: I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
CARAVAGGIO: I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
THE PATIENT: I see.
CARAVAGGIO: Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
THE PATIENT: And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
CARAVAGGIO: You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
THE PATIENT: I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise. The rest meant nothing to me.
CARAVAGGIO: What did you say?
THE PATIENT: The rest meant nothing to me.
CARAVAGGIO: There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition. It did this. If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
THE PATIENT: Thousands of people did die, just different people.
CARAVAGGIO: But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
THE PATIENT: ( a bitter laugh ) Is that what you thought? That I betrayed the British? The British betrayed me. The British betrayed me.
ALMÁSY: Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
KATHARINE: ( eyes rolling, an incredible weariness ) I can't move. I can't get out. Almásy starts to pull at the wreck around her.
ALMÁSY: Why did he bring you?
KATHARINE: A surprise, he said. Almásy inspects Clifton, tries to find a pulse. The smoke circles around them. Katharine looks at her husband.
KATHARINE: Poor Geoffrey. He knew. He must have known all the time. He was shouting - I love you, Katharine, I love you so much. Is he badly hurt? His neck is odd. Almásy puts his arm around Katharine to try and pull her clear. She can't stand the pain.
KATHARINE: Please don't move me. It hurts too much.
ALMÁSY: We've got to get you out of here.
KATHARINE: It hurts too much.
ALMÁSY: ( can't bear to hurt her ) I know, darling, I'm sorry. The smoke thickens. He pulls - hard - the pain from which causes Katharine to gasp, then pass out. They slip haphazardly to the ground, cushioned a little by the sand. He lifts her gently into his arms and carries her from the danger of the place, then turns and runs back. THE PLANE SUDDENLY ERUPTS IN FLAMES. Almásy dashes into the fire, disappearing into the smoke before emerging with Clifton over his shoulder, fireman's-lift style.
KATHARINE: ( whispering ) Why did you hate me?
ALMÁSY: Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
KATHARINE: Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
ALMÁSY: Don't talk.
KATHARINE: ( gasping ) You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk. They stagger on. He suddenly notices a stain of gold at her neck. It's saffron, leaking from a silver THIMBLE which hangs from a black ( overwhelmed ) You're wearing the thimble.
ALMÁSY: ( overwhelmed ) You're wearing the thimble.
KATHARINE: Of course. You idiot. I always wear it. I've always worn it. I've always loved you. Almásy CRIES as he walks - huge sobs, no words - convulsed with the pain of it. They approach the Cave.
KATHARINE: It's so cold.
ALMÁSY: I know. I'm sorry. I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
KATHARINE: ( panicking suddenly ) Don't leave me!
ALMÁSY: I'm just going to find things for the fire. 179a. INT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. TORCHLIGHT. Almásy returns with the stocks of ACACIA TWIGS the Expedition had cached. As he makes the fire, the light sends his shadow flitting across the walls.
KATHARINE: Shall we be all right?
ALMÁSY: Yes. Absolutely.
KATHARINE: ( with a laugh ) Oh dear.
ALMÁSY: ( as he works ) Listen to me, Katharine. You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it. I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe. I'm going to have to walk to El Taj. Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel. And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you. The fire is lit and he comes over to her, kneels beside her.
KATHARINE: Do you promise? I wouldn't want to die here. I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns. Very English. And I know exactly where I want to be buried. In our garden. Where I grew up. With a view of the sea. So promise me you'll come back for you.
ALMÁSY: I promise I'll come back. I promise I'll never leave you. And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party. He kisses her tenderly. Pulls out his HERODOTUS and lays it beside her. Then he puts down the FLASHLIGHT.
ALMÁSY: And a good read. Don't waste it.
KATHARINE: Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know he's dead.
ALMÁSY: I'm sorry, Katharine.
KATHARINE: I know.
ALMÁSY: Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again. He's tearing strips from the parachute with his knife. As he starts to bind her wrist he gets her to talk, trying to distract her from the Tell me about your garden.
ALMÁSY: Tell me about your garden.
KATHARINE: ( tries to focus ) Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France. The Devil's Chimney it was called - ( he pulls tight on the binding ) The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why. ( he kisses her ) Darling. My darling.
OFFICER: Good morning!
ALMÁSY: Could I trouble you for some water?
OFFICER: ( registering the accented English ) Yes, of course. ( the Corporal has a water bottle, hands it to Almásy ) So, golly, where have you come from?
ALMÁSY: ( gulping the water ) I desperately need a jeep. There's been an accident.
OFFICER: I see.
ALMÁSY: ( brain racing ) No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle? I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and. ( calculating ) Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
OFFICER: Do you have your papers, sir?
ALMÁSY: If I could just see some identification.
OFFICER: If I could just see some identification.
ALMÁSY: Am I not talking sense? - forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers. I am a member of the Royal Geographical Right. And what's your name, sir?
OFFICER: Right. And what's your name, sir?
ALMÁSY: Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down. A glance at his Corporal.
OFFICER: Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me? What nationality would that be?
ALMÁSY: Look, listen to me. A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here. I have been walking for three days! I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
OFFICER: ( writing ) I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
ALMÁSY: ( snapping ) No! NO! Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep! Almásy sets on the Officer, hauling him by the lapels, but them immediately loses his balance. As he stumbles up he gets the stock of the Corporal's RIFLE across his head, KNOCKING HIM TO THE GROUND.
ALMÁSY: ( shouting hoarse ) Hey! Hey! Stop this jeep! Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
CORPORAL: Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me. My wife is dying.
ALMÁSY: Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me. My wife is dying.
CORPORAL: Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
ALMÁSY: Fritz? What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
CORPORAL: That's your name innit? Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish? Almásy, berserk, starts to yank at his chains, screaming.
ALMÁSY: Let me out, let me out, let me out - Katharine! Katharine!
ALMÁSY: Excuse me. I also need to use the lavatory.
SOLDIER: You'll have to wait. Sarge! Jerry wants to use the lav - says it's urgent.
ALMÁSY: Where are we going, please?
SOLDIER: To the coast. Benghazi. Soon be there. Get a boat home. You'll be all right. ALMÁSY CAN'T BEAR THIS NEWS. The SERGEANT returns.
SERGEANT: What's up?
ALMÁSY: Cramps. It's urgent.
SERGEANT: Go on then - you take him.
THE PATIENT: So yes. She died because of me. Because I loved her. Because I had the wrong name.
HANA: What are you up to?
KIP: That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember? That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge. It's red hot.
KIP: When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
HANA: I should go to the house, get breakfast.
KIP: The lamp was burning all night in his room. Caravaggio was there with him. She goes to kiss him. He is over the fire and protests.
KIP: This is hot!
HANA: ( teasing him ) 193. INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY. Caravagio is injecting the Patient with morphine.
CARAVAGGIO: And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
THE PATIENT: Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise. To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't. I couldn't even do that properly.
CARAVAGGIO: You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you. You killed my friends, you ruined my hands. But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
THE PATIENT: You can't kill me. I died years ago.
CARAVAGGIO: No, now I can't kill you. Kip storms into the room, walks straight up to the Patient and POINTS A GUN AT HIM. Caravaggio is taken by surprise.
CARAVAGGIO: Kip - what are - ?
KIP: Stay out of this.
THE PATIENT: I looked up to you, Uncle. My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
KIP: I looked up to you, Uncle. My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
THE PATIENT: What are you talking about?
KIP: What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky. And now this. He approaches the bed. Caravaggio tries to intervene.
CARAVAGGIO: Kip, listen - Kip sings the rifle at him, KNOCKING HIM to the floor.
KIP: I said keep out of this! He pulls of his earphones and rams them around the Patient's head, dropping the set onto the bed. The Patient listens, coughing.
KIP: Can you hear? Can you hear what they're celebrating? I listened to you, Uncle. Sitting at your feet - always sitting at somebody's feet - trying to learn. The right way to hold a teacup, otherwise you're out, the pukkah knot in your tie - as if everything can be explained in terms of a cricket bat and an accent.
CARAVAGGIO: Kip -
KIP: Kip! - it's not even my name because you can't say it. Kirpal Singh Bhuller is my name. Hana runs in, alerted by the commotion, stunned by what she sees.
CARAVAGGIO: Well, then ask him his name!
HANA: ( getting in between Kip and the Patient ) What's happened? Kip! What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
KIP: They're excited! They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City? Never!
THE PATIENT: ( pulling off the earphones ) Go on, do it. I don't need to hear any more.
CARAVAGGIO: Kip, listen, he lost everything because he wasn't English - Jesus! - shoot me, I'm more English than he is! Kip levels the gun at the Patient. Then breaks it open, throws it down on the bed, next to the earphones, from which the news continues to leak, some words audible - Eunola Gay. Hiroshima. and from different voices - It was beautiful! just beautiful! Bang! the biggest bang you ever saw!
HANA: Kip. Kip. It's me. Why? It's another bomb. However big, what's the difference? There've been so many bombs. What about Coventry? What about Dresden? Where were those cities? I don't understand. Let me come in. The shadow doesn't move. Hana is at a loss.
KIP: Will you come with me?
HANA: Of course. When?
KIP: I mean home. India.
HANA: Kip. I -
KIP: ( interrupting this ) I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
HANA: Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think?
KIP: It's what I've learned.
HANA: I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin. And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can. A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us. She stands, goes to him.
HANA: I've clung to you. I've clung to you. Kip. Life a raft.
KIP: ( clinging to her ) Then come with me.
HANA: I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
KIP: I'll always go back to that church.
HANA: So one day we'll meet. He nods, winds up the throttle, and is gone.
THE PATIENT: Thank you. Thank you. She kisses him, gently on the mouth. He closes his eyes.
THE PATIENT: Read to me, will you? Read me to sleep.
ALMÁSY: Katharine, my darling. He sobs, whispering to her. He's terribly cold, exhausted. He slips underneath the covers to be next to her, and closes his eyes.
ALMÁSY: I'm so tired.
HANA: My darling, I'm waiting for you - how long is a day in the dark, or a week? The Patient looks across AND WHAT HE SEES IS KATHARINE BESIDE HIM IN
CARAVAGGIO: Hana! Come on! He gets up into the BALUSTRADE, tentatively finds his balance, then starts to walk, heel to toe - slowly, and then with more confidence - along the long thin line of stone. The children watch intently. He turns and bows.
CARAVAGGIO: Hana - this is Gioia. Gioia smiles, shakes her hand. Then Hana meets the others - Gioia's brother and wife, their children. She smiles at them.
HANA: Buon' giorno.
CARAVAGGIO: She can take you as far as Florence.
HANA: I can get in the back. And she clambers up, sits down between the children. They exchange some small stiff, shy smiles, and then the truck bounces away. Hana takes one final look at the Monastery as it disappears around the bend and then turns and confronts the life insisting noisily in the truck.
