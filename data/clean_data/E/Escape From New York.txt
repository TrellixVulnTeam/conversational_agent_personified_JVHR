He's wearing a black spandex/kevlar type shirt with zippers across the shoulders, and a pair of camouflage pants with lots of pockets. His jacket is a brown leather jacket that has seen far better days, and he's wearing a pair of handcuffs that have, instead of the links we're used to, a straight metal bar between them. He's not resisting anything, but the police are not taking any chances.

HAUK: Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia. Youngest man to be decorated by the President. You robbed the federal reserve depository. Life sentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary. I'm ready to kick your ass out of the world, War Hero. Snake could not care less. He reaches forward with his still-cuffed right hand, picks up a cigarette, picks up a match with his left hand, strikes the match and takes a drag from his cigarette. He lets out a calm breath and says:
SNAKE: act committed in the United States. Hauk shows Snake the pardon. Snake's eye lights up. This is something he wants. He's interested now, and can't hide it.

HAUK: There was an accident about an hour ago. A small jet went down inside New York City. The President was on board.
SNAKE: President of what?
HAUK: bring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man. We sense amusement from Snake. This is not the first time the government has asked him for a favor. But he's not a soldier or a "War Hero" anymore. He knows they need him more than he needs their pardon. He's holding the cards now, and he knows it.

MAGGIE: The Duke's car heads right for us.
MAGGIE: The two of them run off. After a while, Snake follows. The three of them hide. The Duke's car is an old Chrysler with chandeliers suspended over the headlights. It's in a caravan of three, leading the way. A fourth car comes up later. The Duke is sitting in the passenger seat of a car with Weirdo in the back. The Duke gets out of the car, Weirdo at his side. The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, a snazzy jacket, bluejeans, and boots. He looks TOUGH. He sends Weirdo to knock on the door.

FIRST GUARD: He turns and Snake throws a star at him. It lodges right in his brain, but not fast enough. Snake is hit in the leg with a crossbow arrow. Snake limps over to the President and starts uncuffing him. The president still has the briefcase. This is it, this is the big time. Snake keeps calm.

DUKE: Brain moves, and Weirdo laughs that odd laugh. The Duke fires at the President's briefcase. Papers and a tape fall out. Weirdo looks down and kicks the tape away. He picks it up and holds it to his ear, then puts it in his pocket. Guards come and unstrap the President. The Duke has decided to take Snake a bit more seriously than he had. Which is not saying much.
