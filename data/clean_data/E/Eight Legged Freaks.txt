JOSHUA: Hey, Mike. Check this one out.
MIKE: He's huge!
JOSHUA: They've been like this all week. Must be something extra tasty in the water.
MIKE: Like what?
JOSHUA: Dead coyote. Snake maybe. Back in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a dash of habanero sauce. Mighty
MIKE: You ate snake?
JOSHUA: When you're thirty klicks out from the nearest firebase. Humpin' through the wake-up with your finger on the trigger. Charlie doesn't give you time to stop for
JOSHUA: Quiet, bird. We're working.
JOSHUA: ( dims tank lights ) The sun is going down, my nocturnal hunters. It's time to come out and feed.
MIKE: Yeah. They're definitely getting I've calculated a growth factor of twelve percent over the last forty-eight hours. But that seems to be accelerating.
JOSHUA: I've calculated a growth factor of twelve percent over the last forty-eight hours. But that seems to be accelerating.
MIKE: All from eating these bugs? Maybe I should try some. Run, little guys.
MIKE: Run, little guys.
JOSHUA: They can't outrun the food chain.
MIKE: I could get away.
JOSHUA: Imagine yourself the size of that fly. A scytodes spitter would be as big as a Cadillac. You'd be spider chow, kid.
MIKE: Are the new tarantulas in here?
JOSHUA: Took me forever to get a breeding set of Chilean reds. I must have bribed every customs agent from Vegas to Santiago.
MIKE: That is too cool.
JOSHUA: Male tarantulas compete for the female's attention.
JOSHUA: The prey is cocooned alive so she can eat them in her nest. You know how women love breakfast in
JOSHUA: Take a look, the female of the species is three times as big as the male. Say hello to Consuela.
JOSHUA: Say hello to Consuela.
JOSHUA: She fills her prey with digestive acid to liquify the internal organs. Now watch. She'll drink her victim from the inside out. While it's still alive!
MIKE: ( looks queasy ) And you wonder why my mom doesn't like me hanging out with you.
JOSHUA: Arachnids have been roaming the earth for millions of years. And they'll be here long after the human race is dead and buried.
MIKE: Bad! Bad Consuela!
MIKE: Do that again and I feed you to the parrot.
JOSHUA: There's your mom.
MIKE: See you tomorrow, Joshua!
CHRIS: ( CONTINUED )
CHRIS: Hope you like bologna!
MIKE: You should see them, Mom. Each one has a unique feeding behavior. The spitters fire poisonous snot. The tarantulas mummify their prey. The jumpers can.
SAM: Why does he have all those things?
MIKE: He studies them. NASA uses spider webs in outer space. And for medicine. They've been here forever, and they'll be here long after we're all dead.
SAM: You're givin' me nightmares.
MIKE: Nightmares are cool.
SAM: U.P.S. brought this to the

SAM: Better late than never.
MIKE: Is that the one you wanted?
SAM: Is that the one you wanted?
MIKE: Cassiopeia 2304 with 64 megs of ram. Integrated modem. Voice recording capability. This baby is tight.
SAM: What's wrong?
MIKE: He forgot to send the batteries.
SAM: ( annoyed ) I told him to send batteries.
BRET: Hang on, babydoll!
ASHLEY: Oh shit.
SAM: Hang on.
MIKE: EXT. HIGHWAY ( DESERT ) - DAY The police car does an impressive bootlegger 180. Lights ablaze. SIREN WAILING. The bikes pull over to the EXT. SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY ( DESERT ) - DAY The motorcycles stop with the cop car behind. Sam's voice barks over the PA.
BRET: There is something very sexy about an older woman in uniform.
LARRY: Her nine-millimeter gives me a Don't antagonize her, you guys.
ASHLEY: Don't antagonize her, you guys.
SAM: I told you not to act like kamikazes. Especially with Ashley riding behind. That is unacceptable, Bret.
BRET: I could always ride her from
SAM: You just bought yourself a
ASHLEY: Can't you give 'em a break?
SAM: Get in the car, Ashley. Now.
ASHLEY: But, Mom!
BRET: No sweat, babydoll. We'll hook up Over my dead body.
SAM: ( threatening ) Over my dead body.
MIKE: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used.
ASHLEY: Shut up, dork.
BRET: Larry, do we know anybody at City Hall who can mark this go away?
LARRY: Your Dad is the Mayor.
BRET: Oh, yeah. He signs your paycheck.
SAM: The next time you put my daughter's life in danger, I'll show you exactly how little that means to me.
BRET: Relax, bee-otch. It's all good.
SAM: I want both wheels on the ground.
MIKE: I read her her rights.
SAM: I can always count on you, Mike.
ASHLEY: Do you get off on humiliating me?
SAM: This bad girl act doesn't suit you, Ash.
ASHLEY: I'm just trying to have fun. Don't you remember what it's like to grow up here?
SAM: That's what scares me.
SAM: I told you to keep this with you.
ASHLEY: You are so over protective.
SAM: A mother's job is to protect her You need to start trusting me.
ASHLEY: You need to start trusting me.
SAM: I'd like to. But you keep skipping classes to go to the dunes with Bret.
ASHLEY: Why do you hate him so much?
SAM: I don't hate him. I just want you to have a future. I thought you wanted to get out of town. Go to med school.
ASHLEY: Maybe I want to stay. I could get pregnant by nineteen. Then divorce with a couple of kids I can't handle. Slap on a badge and be a trailer trash sheriff.
SAM: ( deeply hurt ) Thanks for the flashback.
CHRIS: Oh, great.
CHRIS: Right on.
WADE: With one phone call I could put together a deal that would make us all very rich.
HARLAN: They say money doesn't buy They probably don't have any.
WADE: They probably don't have any.
FLOYD: Yeah, of boredom.
WADE: Think about it, Harlan, you could buy a commercial transmitter and start broadcasting to a national It would be nice to get the message out. Let people know the aliens walk among us.
HARLAN: It would be nice to get the message out. Let people know the aliens walk among us.
SAM: Sam flips on the SIREN and accelerates.

SAM: That's enough!
CHRIS: Stay out of this, Sam!
CHRIS: Did you hear what he said?
SAM: I heard.
WADE: I want him locked up!
SAM: Let's all calm down.
WADE: We have no economy! People are barely scraping by! And now we've been offered the deal of a lifetime. You don't have the right to stand in our way!
CHRIS: Those mines are full of gas. One spark in the wrong place could blow this entire valley sky high. Do you really want to load that gun with toxic waste?
WADE: Chem-Tech did seismic analysis, vapor checks, groundwater reads, soil sampling. They found isolated methane pockets, but no benzene or hydrogen sulfide.
CHRIS: How could they run tests? I didn't give them permission to go into the mines.
CHRIS: I asked you a question, you greedy son of a bitch!
WADE: I'm greedy?! You're the one keeping us down so you can search for gold!
SAM: Don't take another step.
CHRIS: You're taking his side?
SAM: I'm trying to keep the peace.
WADE: You're crazy! Just like your He wasn't crazy.
CHRIS: ( sotto ) He wasn't crazy.
SAM: It's okay. Maybe you're not gay after all.
ASHLEY: Maybe you're not gay after all.
SAM: What are you talking about?
ASHLEY: You can't take your eyes off his Where did you learn that it's okay to talk to me like this?
SAM: Where did you learn that it's okay to talk to me like this?
ASHLEY: Relax, Mom. He's hot for an old guy. I can admit it. Why can't

GLADYS: Another vein of iron pyrite?
CHRIS: Yeah. Then a rat stole my lunch. I practically blew myself up trying to get it back.
GLADYS: I'm glad you like my bologna Maybe you should talk to Wade.
CHRIS: What are you saying?
GLADYS: Honey, if he really does have a You of all people know how much my dad wanted to find that mother Your daddy wanted to get rich. I don't think he cared how that happened. If he was still alive, maybe he'd sell those mines.
CHRIS: You of all people know how much my dad wanted to find that mother Your daddy wanted to get rich. I don't think he cared how that happened. If he was still alive, maybe he'd sell those mines.
GLADYS: Your daddy wanted to get rich. I don't think he cared how that happened. If he was still alive, maybe he'd sell those mines.
CHRIS: And maybe you didn't know him so well after all.
GLADYS: You're right. I'm just worried about how we're going to pay these Don't give up on me, Gladys. I promised him I'd find the gold. And I will.
CHRIS: Don't give up on me, Gladys. I promised him I'd find the gold. And I will.
