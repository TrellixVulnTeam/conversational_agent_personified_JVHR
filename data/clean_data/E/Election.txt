JIM: Morning, Lowell
JIM: Twenty-one. twenty-two.
MOTHER: ( distant ) Good luck!
TRACY: Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
JIM: Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
TRACY: ( chirping ) You know what they say about the early Yes, I do.
JIM: Yes, I do.
JIM: Well, good luck there, Tracy
TRACY: Thanks, Mr. M.
PAUL: Stop daydreaming! Get back to work!
JIM: C'mon, wolverines! Defense! Let's hold 'em back!
JIM: So would this be an ethical situation or a moral situation? What's the difference between ethics and morals, Tracy shoots her hand into the air. JIM notices but keeps looking Other hands rise tentatively
DEREK: Uh, ethics is like when you, uh, do what society tells you is right and morals are like, uh.
JIM: You're on the right track, who can help him out?
DEREK: ..morals are when.
JIM: Morals are like lessons, you know, like the moral of a story; it's what you learn from a story or a fable or something. . .
MICHELLE: Morals are like lessons, you know, like the moral of a story; it's what you learn from a story or a fable or something. . .
JIM: Or a life experience. Good. And That's more like, urn. Ethics is how you use the morals. that you learn from a story?
MICHELLE: That's more like, urn. Ethics is how you use the morals. that you learn from a story?
JIM: Okay. But we're still missing something key here. What are we I know.
TRACY: ( hand still raised ) I know.
JIM: ( finally ) Ethics are.
TRACY: Ethics are.
TRACY: ( off-key ) I'm just a girl who can't say no.
TRACY: I agree with Ashley. We should rent the barrels at least a day beforehand. What happened last time was a travesty, I mean, we were
LARRY FOUCH: ( trying to quiet her ) Yeah, no, I know, Tracy. That's why we're Look, can we just take a vote on this?
TRACY: .the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a.
DAVE: Her pussy gets so wet you can't believe WIDE - Dave is leaning across his desk to speak with JIM at an adjacent work area. They eat sack lunches.
JIM: Don't tell me that. I don't want to know that.
DAVE: She's incredible. Everything just gets INT. JIM'S BASEMENT DAY Dun-dun-DUN. Dun-dun-DUN
DAVE: ( singing ) Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker. Foxy. You know you're a sweet little love maker.
DAVE: You know, Tracy. I don't know how to say this, but.
TRACY: Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
DAVE: Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
TRACY: No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
DAVE: I know. I know its not by choice. I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
TRACY: What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
DAVE: What kind of person?
TRACY: ( embarrassed, low ) Thank you.
DAVE: And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
DAVE: ( looking around ) Here, get down.
DAVE: Look at you.
JIM: You did it at your house? Your own Look, Jim. Okay. I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the. for the sex and the danger. But now it's different. Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in In love?
DAVE: Look, Jim. Okay. I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the. for the sex and the danger. But now it's different. Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in In love?
JIM: In love?
DAVE: Yeah, it's serious. I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
JIM: But you haven't written your novel.
DAVE: That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here. I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it. It's Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend. What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
JIM: Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend. What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
DAVE: You're not just jealous, are you? I mean, we both used to talk about her
JIM: ( exploding ) That was just talk! Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts? We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code. The line you've crossed is. it's illegal and it's immoral.
DAVE: I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay? I know what
JIM: I'm not talking about ethics. I'm talking about morals.
DAVE: ( to Jim, whispering ) Look, I appreciate your concern. I really do. But like I said, I got it under control.
JIM: sits on the vinyl sofa.
DAVE: Tracy's Mom she doesn't understand.
WALT: No, I'd say she doesn't. I don't think I've ever seen a mother quite so upset. We're all very, very lucky she doesn't want this public.
DAVE: But we're in love
WALT: Dave. Dave, look at me
WALT: I want you to get some help.
SHERRY: Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
DAVE: Sherry Sherry Sheerrry. .

TRACY: Mr. McAllister? Mr. McAllister! Wait up
I: Jim, his tie loose and his sleeves rolled up, looks up from unlocking his car. Tracy runs toward him holding out a TERM PAPER FOLDER.
TRACY: I got all my signatures. One hundred and fifty-eight way more than I need!
JIM: Hey, that's super
TRACY: Here they are.
JIM: You can put those in my box. I'll look at them tomorrow.
TRACY: Could you approve them now? I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
JIM: ( resigned ) He cursorily flips through the bound pages and offers them back to JIM ( CONT'D ) Looks good to me.
TRACY: Aren't you supposed to keep them?
JIM: NO, that's fine
TRACY: I thought you were supposed to keep Okay, fine. Sure
JIM: Okay, fine. Sure
TRACY: Thanks for everything.
JIM: You bet.
TRACY: ( cheery, awkward ) I can't wait to start campaigning.
JIM: Should be easy. So far no competition.
TRACY: Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number Yeah. Okay. well, good luck Tracy
JIM: Yeah. Okay. well, good luck Tracy
TRACY: You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year. And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
JIM: Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
TRACY: Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
JIM: Good luck, Tracy.
DIANE: Anything wrong?
JIM: Everything's fine. Just, you know, INT. MCALLISTER BEDROOM - NIGHT JIM lies awake in bed while Diane snores beside him. Something seems to be echoing in his head.
TRACY'S VOICE: .You know, Coca-Cola's by far the number one soft drink. When I win the presidency we're going to be spending a lot of time together. a lot of time. lots and lots and lots of time. president and advisor. . .
TRACY: .harmonious and productive. close and special. you and I. so close. so intimate. together.
JIM: ( quietly ) EXT. SKI SLOPE ( REAR PROJECTION ) DAY PAUL METZLER is SKIING in goggles and scarf. Behind him is a cheesy dated rear projection of other skiers. Suddenly Paul loses his balance and FALLS.
PAUL: Why. . . ? Why. . . ?
JIM: Paul, could I talk to you for a minute?
JIM: Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
PAUL: I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it. And maybe go on to.
JIM: I know. I understand disappointment. I really do.
PAUL: But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity. I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
JIM: But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity. I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
PAUL: What do you mean?
JIM: Let me give you a clue. You're a born leader. You're one of the most popular students at Millard. You're honest and straightforward. You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside. The other kids look up to you. What does that spell?
JIM: Student. council. president.
PAUL: Who, me? Nooo. I never. I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and
JIM: Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
PAUL: And she's super-nice
JIM: Yeah. But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a. well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
JIM: Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
PAUL: Huh? Oh. Uh. pears
JIM: takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
JIM: Okay, let's say
PAUL: No, wait apples. Apples.
JIM: Fine. Let's say all you ever knew was apples. Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
PAUL: I also like bananas.
JIM: Exactly. So what do you say? Maybe it's time to give a little something INT. STUDENT COMHON AREA DAY Tracy directs her friend ERIC OVERHOLDT on a ladder as he hangs a large POSTER high on a wall.
TRACY: The right side is too high. The right side. Just a smidge.
GUY: ( signing ) Hey Paul, you going over to Anthony's on Friday, or what did you decide?
PAUL: I gotta talk to him first.
TRACY: Who put you up to this?
PAUL: Huh? Oh, hi, Tracy
TRACY: Who put you up to this?
PAUL: What do you mean?
TRACY: You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
PAUL: No. Uh. I just. you know, I just Thought what?
TRACY: Thought what?
PAUL: Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything. and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
TRACY: So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
PAUL: Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea. and how there's all different kinds of fruit and. It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best. I just thought
TRACY: Okay, Mr. Popular. You're on.
PAUL: Paul. Paul. power. Paul. Paul for President. progress. promise. peanut. Paul-i-tics. yeah. President Paul. Punt for Paul! No.
TAMMY: ( softly ) I told you . I can't. I just It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
LISA: I told you . I can't. I just It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
TAMMY: If you could just get out of your head.
LISA: I said no!
PAUL: Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
TAMMY: Don't you fucking knock?
PAUL: Yeah. So guess what happened. So Mr. McAllister, he Oh hi. Lisa.
TAMMY: Paul, get out!
PAUL: So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me
LISA: I gotta go.
TAMMY: ( to Paul ) You dumbshit!
PAUL: What'd I do?
TAMMY: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CONTINUOUS Tammy runs up to the car as it pulls away. She pounds on the window.
TAMMY: Stop! Wait!
LISA: I'm not like you.
TAMMY: I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just. I was just Lisa speeds away, and we watch her car grow smaller and smaller.
LISA: I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just. I was just Lisa speeds away, and we watch her car grow smaller and smaller.
NOTE: ( Tammy's voice ) If you died right now, I would throw myself into one of my Dad's cement trucks and get poured into your tomb.
LISA: Are you crazy?
TAMMY: People can see this.
LISA: People can see this.
TAMMY: These are private these are for us.
LISA: These are private these are for us.
TAMMY: I know.
LISA: But other people can see them too.
TAMMY: I don't care.
LISA: Well, I do.
FROM OVERHEAD: Paul is sprawled on Lisa's bed, surrounded by stuffed animals. His legs dangle over the edge of the bed, and Lisa kneels between them, her head bobbing up and down.
LISA: I've wanted this for so long.
PAUL: Uhhh. teeth. Teeth.
LISA: INT. MILLARD HIGH CAFETERIA DAY Paul and Lisa sit with some other friends at a lunch table. Paul has one arm around Lisa as he eats with his other hand.
FADE OUT: INT. SHERRY NOVOTNY'S BACKYARD DAY A laughing BABY BOY is lowered into frame and pulled back up again. Then he swings across frame. It's little DARRYL NOVOTNY.
DIANE: Jim, don't. You're scaring him.
JIM: He likes it.
DIANE: Here. Give him to me. is little Darryl dizzy? That's it. . come here. . .
SHERRY: You got him?
DIANE: Sherry heads into the house. JIM watches her walk, then turns toward Diane and Darryl. It's as though Diane, not Sherry, were the infant's real mother, so loving and attentive is she, so swelled with maternal
DIANE: You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
JIM: Yeah, uh, just a minute
DIANE: Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
JIM: Yeah, just
DIANE: Do it!
DIANE: Could you hand me the remote?
SHERRY: Say, Jim. Jim.
JIM: JIM takes the bottle. CLOSE ON the neck as the cork emerges: POP!
JIM: ( indicating ) More this way.
SHERRY: ( indicating ) More this way.
JIM: Okay. Give me the drill.
JIM: I'd always liked Sherry, but we'd never had a chance to spend any time alone together. How with Dave out of the picture, I began to see what an incredibly sensitive and giving person she was.
SHERRY: What do you think?
JIM: You look great
SHERRY: I can't afford this stuff right now.
JIM: Oh, come on. You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time. Let go; live a little.
SHERRY: You sure?
JIM: So what do you think? Should we get a Should we get a what?
SHERRY: Should we get a what?
JIM: points at the motel.
DIANE: How'd it go?
JIM: Fine. You know. We just went to You guys have fun?
DIANE: You guys have fun?
JIM: ( between bites ) Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
DIANE: Well, Sherry's great. But she can be a little much sometimes.
JIM: Well, Sherry's great. But she can be a little much sometimes.
DIANE: Oh, Jim! Oh, God!
FADE OUT: UNDER BLACK
UNDER BLACK: JIM ( VO ) So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
PAUL: Tammy? Tammy, what are you doing?
TRACY: You're the advisor. You should stop her. She's not qualified. She's just a Calm down, Tracy. Just calm down.
JIM: Calm down, Tracy. Just calm down.
TRACY: Are you sure all her signatures are real? It's not easy to get all those As far as I know, they
JIM: As far as I know, they
PAUL: We can't both run, can we? We're brother and sister. Can we?
LISA: It's a conflict of interest. And Paul was first.
JIM: Anyone who gets signatures in on time can run. And she got in just under the wire. Nothing I can do.
TRACY: Let me see them. Let me see them
TRACY: These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this Looks like Tim Kobza.
JIM: ( taking the sheet ) Looks like Tim Kobza.
LISA: She's doing this to get back at me
PAUL: For what?
LISA: I mean at you.
PAUL: For what?
LISA: I don't know. You're her brother you should know.
TRACY: Tim Kobza? Tim Kobza! Who's he? I've never heard of him!
JIM: Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy? We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
JERRY: I love Millard High, and I will be a dedicated vice President. A vote for Jerry Slavin is a vote for good government. And even if I can't really stand up for you, I will. Thank you.
JIM: Thank you, Jerry, and good luck. Again, Jerry is running unopposed for Vice President. So we'll move on now to the presidential race with three candidates running. The first in alphabetical order is Tracy Flick.
TRACY: Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote, "I cannot make my days longer, so I strive to make them better." With this election, we here at Millard also have an opportunity to make our high school days better. During this campaign I have had the opportunity to speak with many of you about your concerns. I spoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez, who told me how alienated she feels from her own homeroom. I spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks, who said his mother works in a cafeteria and can't afford to buy him enough spiral notebooks for his classes. I won't bore you with long- winded promises about all the new and innovative things I will definitely achieve during the year in which it will be my honor and privilege to represent each and every one of you, but I can say that my years of experience on the student council have taught me the three most important attributes the president needs to possess; commitment -
DOUG SCHENKEN: Eat me
DOUG'S BUDDY: Eat me raw!
WALT: If you can't be adults and give these candidates the courtesy they deserve, then you don't deserve to be called adults but children Because that's what children are. And you'll be treated like children. So let's all listen up.
TRACY: The three most important attributes the president needs to possess are: commitment, qualifications, and experience. I'll add one more; caring. I care about Millard, and I care about each and every one of you, and together we can all make a difference. One of the things I would like to establish is a regular open forum where any student can come and voice their concern about issues we face here at Millard. I and the rest of the student council would then interface with the faculty and staff, so a continuous dialogue would Walt whispers to Jim.
WALT: I'd say she knows a thing or two about student-faculty dialogue.
TRACY: When you cast your vote for Tracy Flick next week, you won't just be voting for me. You'll be voting for yourself and for every other student Our days won't be any longer, but they can sure be better. Thank you.
JIM: The next candidate for student body president is Paul Metzier. Paul?
PAUL: As many of you know I broke my leg pretty bad thi3 year and the experience has made me reevaluate what I want to do with my life and that is help people when you think about it a school is more than a school it's our second home where we spend all cur time and grow as individuals and a community but is our school everything it could be I want our school to reach its true potential that is why I am running for president.
PAUL: I know what it is to fight hard and win like when we almost went to state last fall and I threw that fourth-quarter pass against Westside for the touchdown that won the game by three points I won't let you down like I didn't then I promise we can all score a winning touchdown together. Vote Paul Metzier for president thank you.
JIM: Okay, Paul. Now our final candidate for President - another one of the Metzier clan sophomore Tammy Metzier.
WALT: People. People I
TAMMY: Who cares about this stupid election?
STUDENTS: Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!
TAMMY: 0h don't vote for me I Who cares? Don't vote at all!
WALT: That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that. She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
JIM: Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech. That's not what student government's about.
WALT: ( grumbling ) Yeah. whatever. All I know is she's a troublemaker. She's on my list.
RON: All we need to do is send a message, so maybe we should just suspend her.
WALT: Right. That's it. She's suspended for a week!
JIM: I think that's a little strong Walt. We don't want to make a martyr out of her. Three days sounds right to me.
RON: We don't want to make a martyr out of her. Three days sounds right to me.
WALT: Okay. Three days. Take care of it.
DUDE: Here you go.
TAMMY: Hey I said lights I
TAMMY: What do you want?
PAUL: Oh. Hi, Tammy. I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your Tammy looks at him, picks up the packet.
TAMMY: Okay, Paul. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
PAUL: Yeah. Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything. But that's okay, you know. l respect your privacy. I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister. Okay? Cause. and I hope you feel the same.
TAMMY: Sure, Paul. No hard feelings.
PAUL: Okay. Great. I feel good.
PAUL: Oh. Oh. Yeah. Right. One other thing. Since you know Lisa so well, could you give me some advice? I want to get her something for helping me with the election. You know, something really special like flowers or candy or flowers and candy. Or is that too typical? I mean, can you think of something? Something really special? You know, something she'd really like?
TRACY: Eric, the "r" is supposed to be green, not blue.
ERIC: Oh. Okay.
TRACY: That's okay. I'm too busy.
THE MONITOR: displays a DIGITIZED PHOTO of the Millard yearbook staff. DAVE NOVOTNY peers proudly from behind two of the taller students. A CURSOR in the shape of tiny SCISSORS makes a small circle around Dave's face. Suddenly, the cursor turns into a tiny HAND and drags Dave's dislodged head into the TRASH.
TRACY: ( under her breath ) Let's see. "save" is Command "S." INT. MILLARD HIGH HALLWAY NIGHT Tracy is heading down the hall toward the exit when she rounds a corner and, suddenly deeply troubled, sees that
TIME DISSOLVE: to Tracy even farther down the hall, still jumping, still ripping.
TRACY: I didn't do this. I didn't do it.
JIM: There's your culprit
SHERRY: ( not missing a beat ) CLOSE ON AN OPEN TOILET - Plop! The hairwad joins several smaller stringy friends.
SHERRY: Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
JIM: No, I. uh, didn't know that
SHERRY: All his life. He's tried everything.
JIM: ( about the shower ) Still clear?
SHERRY: We'll let it run awhile
JIM: We'll let it run awhile
SHERRY: This one's clean.
SHERRY: Hey Yeah?
SHERRY: Take me to that motel. Like you Right now?
JIM: Right now?
SHERRY: Easy, tiger. Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
JIM: Three twenty-five.
SHERRY: Three twenty-five.
LISA: It's not fair. It's not fair
PAUL: I just don't think anybody would do something like that on purpose. It must have been some kind of mistake. Like a maintenance thing.
WALT: Jim, where the hell have you been?
JIM: Nowhere. I don't have class until second period.
WALT: Even tried you at home. We've got a situation here.
LISA: If Paul loses tomorrow, it's not fair. There has to be another election, with What's the problem?
JIM: What's the problem?
LISA: Didn't you see?
WALT: Somebody tore down their posters.
LISA: Those posters cost a lot of money we don't have I There's no time to make any more posters, there's no
WALT: We'll get to the bottom of it.
PAUL: ( to Lisa ) We still have some extra ones, don't we? Maybe we can just
LISA: It was Tammy I That's who it was.
PAUL: Oh, no, hey. Like I said. Tammy wouldn't. she.
WALT: Well, that speech she gave it was pretty, you know, pretty out there. But we'll get to the bottom of it. Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that. Right, Jim?
JIM: ( his thoughts elsewhere ) Oh yeah, you bet.
LISA: She should be expelled. Or worse!
WALT: You two just go back and focus on your studies. Mr. McAllister's going to handle this.
MR. BECKMAN: Tracy looks up through her goggles.
JIM: is inside.
JIM: Tracy. Come on in. And shut the door behind you.
JIM: I guess you know why you're here
TRACY: If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
JIM: A travesty. Huh. That's interesting, because I think you did it.
TRACY: Wait - are you accusing me? You're not I can't. Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and. I mean, I can't believe it. I'm. I'm shocked!
JIM: Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
TRACY: I was. So? Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
JIM: 6:30. How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
TRACY: I don't. I just know they were there when I left. I'm giving you helpful information is all. You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
JIM: Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it? Whom should we "interrogate?"
TRACY: well, I don't know. It could have been anybody. There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard. You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs. Or Doug Schenken - what about him? Or what about Tammy Metzier? Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
JIM: You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities. But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that. And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
TRACY: Why are you lecturing me?
JIM: This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake. I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences. You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact but maybe one day you'll understand.
TRACY: I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
JIM: I agree. But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
TRACY: And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant. And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
JIM: Okay, Tracy. Have it your way.
TAMMY: You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
JIM: Just wait outside. Tammy.
TAMMY: Okay. But is this about the posters?
JIM: Possibly. Please just wait outside.
TAMMY: ( looking at Tracy ) Because I know who did it. So.. I'll just be outside.
JIM: Tracy, don't go away. Come in, Tammy.
TRACY: This ought to be good
JIM: So. what do you have to tell me?
TAMMY: Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
JIM: ( impatient ) What is it. Tammy?
TAMMY: I'm the one. I did it. I tore down Paul's posters.
JIM: Looks at her skeptically doesn't say a I did it.
JIM: And when did you do it?
TAMMY: This weekend.
JIM: Exactly when?
TAMMY: I don't know. Yesterday. Sunday.
JIM: And how did you get in the school?
TAMMY: Door was open.
JIM: Which door?
TAMMY: I don't know. All I know is I did it I
JIM: I don't believe you.

May 1961, the Apollo program is announced.
