"EVIL DEAD": Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "II." A SLOW ZOOM brings it toward us. And as the screams reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us.
NARRATOR: Legend has it, that it was written by the dark ones: NECRONOMICON EX MORTES; Roughly translated.The Book of the Dead. The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its skin binding and leans toward the camera. EYES on the book blink open and peer at us. It's mouth opens and emits a hideous scream. The CAMERA races into the blackness of the screaming mouth.
NARRATOR: To trace the origin of the Book, we must go back.back.to a day when spirits ruled the earth. Wispy shapes of animated ghosts move through this vortex, coming toward the CAMERA with WAILING and MOANING and then are gone.
NARRATOR: When the seas ran red with blood.
TRACKING SHOT: The CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb. Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall, a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his unusual jagged edged weapon.
LONG SHOT: An old log cabin, built in the valley of a dark forest. A great wind billows fog about the place.
RAYMOND: sobar.Ear-Grets, Gat, .Nos-feratos The sound of RAYMOND reciting the passages is faded down AS THE CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS away from RAYMOND and over to HENRIETTA as she rocks back into the darkness and forward into the light. As she rocks forward into the light, she comes into FULL CLOSEUP revealing that her eyes have changed to a milky white. She continues to MED. SHOT - FOG Blowing past the camera in front of black drape.
RAYMOND: It has only been a few hours since I've translated and spoke aloud the first of the demon resurrection passages from the Book of the Dead. The sound of heavy footsteps. Dust drifts down INTO FRAME. Raymond looks up to the ceiling of the cellar. It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin. He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the floor above him. And then, the footsteps halt.
RAYMOND: And now, I fear that my wife has become host to a Kandarian demon. May God forgive me for what I have unleashed onto this The milky eyed possessed figure of HENRIETTA jolts quickly into the frame, and shrieks in the voice of a demon! Raymond Knowby screams. He drops the microphone.
LINDA: Ash, what's that you're playing?
ASH: Our song. Ash begins to play faster.
LINDA: 14G SHE PULLS AWAY SUDDENLY 14G
LINDA: I really love it. I'll never take it off. They kiss and now begin to dance together, to the haunting waltz melody that sweeps up upon the soundtrack.
PROFESSOR KNOWBY: ( on tape )

ASH: Sun's driven it away. for now. Gotta get the hell out of here. before night falls.
MITCHELL CAMERA: A hideous human skull with living eyeballs that stare out at us with evil malice. The eyes stare out from the two dark windows. The dark nose area is the open doorway, and the rotted teeth of the skull are the whitewashed stones placed at the foot of the cabin. Then it fades, leaving only the cabin.
ED: ( smiling at sight of him )
ANNIE: ( smiling at sight of him )
ED: How'd everything go on the expedition?
ANNIE: Terrific. I found the additional pages from the Book of the Dead.
ED: So you said in the telegram. What condition are they in? She holds out the glass case for Ed to look at.
ED: Haven't aged a day in three thousand years.
ANNIE: Maybe longer.
ED: When do we begin the translations?
ANNIE: Tonight. Is everything all set with my Should be, but I haven't spoken to him in a week, what with no phone in that cabin. Take us about an hour to get there. They arrive at the parking lot. Two new, sharp looking cheverolets and Ed's old style cheverolet.
ED: Should be, but I haven't spoken to him in a week, what with no phone in that cabin. Take us about an hour to get there. They arrive at the parking lot. Two new, sharp looking cheverolets and Ed's old style cheverolet.
ED: We'll take my car. Ed opens the car trunk. Behind him a redcap pulls up a large steamer trunk on a hand dolly. Ed and the redcap hoist the steamer up into the car's trunk.
ED: Annie, you hinted in your telegram that your father was on to something with the first part of his translations. What's the big mystery? What has he found in The Book of the Dead?
ANNIE: Maybe nothing. But just possibly. the doorway to another world? Annie slams the car trunk.
ASH'S POV: Linda's DECAPITATED HEAD rolls across the ground and up the hillside graveyard.
3 ANGLES: As it leaps through the air and gracefully situates itself atop Linda's neck, she begins to spin, yet her head remains in place, never taking her eyes from Ash. With a sensual twirl and leap, she disappears into the evening mists.
LINDA: DANCE WITH ME! Linda extends her dead arms towards Ash.
ASH: That's all. Just a crummy dr- Linda's decapitated head falls into frame and lands in Ash's hands.
LINDA'S HEAD: Hello lover, I came from the other side of your dream to dance with you.
LINDA'S HEAD: Even now we have your darling Linda's soul! She suffers in torment!
LINDA: Please Ash, help me. I love you, please don't hurt me.
LINDA: You promised me we'd always be together. You swore to me!
ASH: 187O CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD 187O
NO!: 187O CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD 187O
LINDA'S HEAD: YES! YOU LIED TO HER! YOU LIED TO LINDA! YOUR LOVE WAS A LIE! AND NOW SHE BURNS IN HELL! She opens her mouth and emits a jet stream of bile.
ASH: Eat chainsaw. He brings down the spinning blade. And moves past the CAMERA and towards the head. We are left looking at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the stark shadow of the ghastly deed. We hear the sound of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a As it is splattered with blood.
ASH: I'm fine. I'm fine.
REFLECTION: I don't losing it. starting to slip. We just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw. Does that sound fine? The reflection tightens its hold on Ash's throat and begins to strangle him.
INTERVOLOMETER: The bite marks that Linda's teeth have left in the hand stand out sharply. The wound suddenly blackens and spiderwebs it's infection across the entire surface of the 197 INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 197 CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HAND IN FOREBROUND - MAKE UP BLADDER EFX The hand quivers and shakes, now out of Ash's control. The hand has taken a whitish cast. It's veins throb and pulsate. It is possessed by the evil force. The hand's fingernails grow inches. The wound oozes black fluid. Ash is repulsed.
ASH: You bastards. Give me back my hand.
ASH: Can't. can't be happening.
ASH: Who's laughing now?
ASH: Who's laughing now!? He lowers the spinning blade of the chainsaw down out of frame and toward the evil hand. Blood flies up into frame.
LONG SHOT: We hear the BUZZING of the CHAINSAW as it slices through bone and then falls silent.
CRANE: The CAMERA cranes down as Annie's car approaches from the distance. It pulls to a halt. Ed and Annie step from the car.
ANNIE: Excuse me. This the road to the Knowby's cabin?
JAKE: Thas' right. But you ain't goin' there.
ANNIE: And why not?
ANNIE: What happened?
JAKE: Lady, I ain't never seen nothin' like Terrific. Now what?
ED: Terrific. Now what?
ANNIE: There must be another way in. Another road or something.
BOBBY JOE: Sure ain't no, road. CAMERA pans over to reveal a brassy southern spitfire of a woman, Bobby Joe.
BOBBY JOE: Hell you wanna go there for, anyway? Bobby Joe takes a pinch of chewing tobacco and stuffs it into her mouth. She doesn't like Annie and her fancy clothes. She stares at Annie like a cat.
ANNIE: None of your business.
JAKE: Hey! I just remembered. Yeah, that's right. There is a trail. You could follow Bobby Joe and me.
ED: That sounds all right.
JAKE: But, it'll cost ya.

JAKE: You know this son of a bitch?
ED: No. We thought her - Annie steps forward.
ANNIE: Oh my God. Where are my parents? Annie sets down the glass case containing the pages of the Book of the Dead.
ANNIE: What the hell did you do to them? Ed pulls Annie off of Ash. She drops Ash's moaning head to the floor and backs away from him, sobbing.
JAKE: We'll throw him in there.
JAKE: Crazy buck's gone blood simple.
ASH: Wait. I made. a mistake.
JAKE: Damn right, you flat mouthed son of a bitch.
ASH DUMMY: Looking up at the open trap door as Ash's body falls through frame.
BOBBY JOE: I hope you rot down there!
MEDIUM SHOT: Ash begins to realize where he is. Growing terror on his battered face.
ASH: N. No.

SET: Henrietta's arm rips through the earth and grabs Ash's leg as he tries to back away. The corpse that was Henrietta pulls itself from the grave and emits a wail. She turns her twisted body to face Ash. Moths fly about her in a flurry.
HENRIETTA: Someone with a fresh soul!
ED: Somebody's down there with him.
ANNIE: No. Can't be.
ASH: Let me out!
ANNIE: Let him out.
JAKE: It's a trick. I know it.
ANNIE: LET HIM OUT! WIDE SHOT - ASH At the top of the steps, pounding on the trap door, screaming to be let out. HENRIETTA ENTERS the FRAME at the bottom of the steps. A flutter of moths about Henrietta begins to climb the steps. Two at a time.

SCREEN ): With a sharp recoil, then spring, Henrietta makes a lunge at Ash. Her face contorting, her teeth lengthening, her mouth opening impossibly wide as though she were going to swallow his head, and all as she lunges forward. She changes to "Pee Wee" head.
CLOSE SHOT: It is Jake who pulls Ash to safety.
ANNIE: For God's sake! That's my mother!
ASH: There's something out there. That. witch in the cellar is only part of it. It lives out in those woods. In the Dark. Something that's come back from the dead.
BOBBY JOE: Jake, let's beat it the hell out o'here, right now. I gotta get out!
JAKE: Now Bobby, you ain't in no condition.
ASH: Nobody goes out that door. Not till They freeze in their tracks as they hear a gentle voice which sings a melancholy tune. Annie turns her head to the sound and the CAMERA PANS TO reveal HENRIETTA whose head juts in the space between the floorboards and the trap door. She is no longer possessed. She looks as she did earlier in the film. She is singing a gentle song to Annie.
HENRIETTA: Remember that song Annie? I used to sing it to you when you were a baby.
HENRIETTA: Let me out, dear. It's so cold and dark in here.
ANNIE: Unlock these chains. Quickly.
HENRIETTA: Unlock these chains. Quickly.
ANNIE: No. No. I don't know what you are but you're not my mother. Annie begins to cry.
ANNIE: VOICE OF HENRIETTA
ANNIE: That thing in the cellar is not my mother! Ed stands sharply into her frame. His eyes bone white, his skin, the pale color of the dead. His mouth has grown over large. His lips are black. He is possessed. He shrieks. Annie screams and jumps back out of frame.
RIGGING: As he floats about the room. His laughter suddenly stops and a second demonic voice comes from his body. It is female, and wailing in lament.
ED: ( In the voice of POSSESSED #1 ) ( In the voice of POSSESSED #2 ) ( In the voice of POSSESSED #1 ) ( In the voice of POSSESSED #2 )

MED. SHOT: A prop light bulb "Shining" in its fixture. Jake's head comes flying up into frame, shattering it, and slamming into the wood ceiling and then falling back down again.
ASH: Start up that saw and hand it here! We're gonna cut him up. Annie looks to the chainsaw and then to the unmoving body of Ed. She is repulsed at the thought.
ANNIE: START IT UP! Possessed Ed stands up quickly into frame! The evil force having re-animated his lifeless body.
ASH: START IT UP! Possessed Ed stands up quickly into frame! The evil force having re-animated his lifeless body.
ANNIE: Possessed Ed stands up quickly into frame! The evil force having re-animated his lifeless body.
NO!: Possessed Ed stands up quickly into frame! The evil force having re-animated his lifeless body.
FLYING PLATFORM: As a hand grabs Ash's throat. Possessed Ed exits frame, revealing it to be Ash's evil hand on his own throat. It lifts him into the air.
RUBBER AXE: Ash brings the axe down upon Ed's shoulder, knocking him to the floor. ASH swings the axe again and again. Different colors of bile and blood fly up into frame as Ash chops.
BOBBY JOE: Jake, I can't take no more of this. Henrietta's rotted hand pulls the bundle of body parts silently down into the cellar and quietly closes the trap.
JAKE: That's funny.
BOBBY JOE: That trail we came in here on. well, it just ain't there no more. Like the woods jus' swallowed it. The room goes quiet. The sound of the wind outside the cabin has died. Jake and Bobby Joe cock their heads to this new silence.

JAKE: What the hell is it?
ASH: Maybe something. Something trying to force its way into our world.

ASH: He didn't do a very good job. What about the passages?
ANNIE: Here it is. Two passages. For the first time, she smiles at Ash.
ANNIE: We've got it!
ANNIE: Recitation of the first passage will make this "Dark Spirit" manifest itself in the flesh.
ASH: Why the hell would we want to do that? Annie thumbs through one or two of the other pages.
ANNIE: Recitation of the second passage creates a kind of rift in time and space, and the physical manifestation of this spirit can be forced back through this rift. to an earlier time and place. At least that's the best translation I can ..

WARRIOR #5: The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors bow. Then twenty. Then fifty. All remove their helmets and kneel silently in the dust. Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS. Ash stands frozen. Terrified, unsure of where or when he is. Knowing only for the present, he is alive. As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a familiar pose. It is the same image of the "Hero from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the film. The strange "jagged edged longsword" is Ash's chainsaw. The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle rears up INTO FRAME. It is seen to be the castle of Kandar. The same castle we saw in the beginning of the film. Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand new. As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by the distant ROAR of some dying animal: The SCREEN cuts to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS BOOM.
