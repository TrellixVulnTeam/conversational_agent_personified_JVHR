REYNOLDS: "I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
HAMERSLEY: What the hell does it mean?
REYNOLDS: It means who's side are you on?
HAMERSLEY: You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
REYNOLDS: It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and
HAMERSLEY: Fuck you.
REYNOLDS: I said fuck you.
HAMERSLEY: I said fuck you.
REYNOLDS: Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
HAMERSLEY: You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? Terrorism, you unconscionable asshole?
REYNOLDS: There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. American buildings. Americans getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
HAMERSLEY: We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill. REYNOLDS regards HAMERSLEY a moment, then opens the car EXT. PARKWAY - MORNING HAMERSLEY's car snakes down the twisting mountain road.
DEAN: I don't know, either, L.T. Maybe you guys should get yourself a labor lawyer.
DEAN: Good point.
DEAN: L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
DEAN: That's because your Union bosses are those Guido mother-fuckers.
DEAN: The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
DEAN: Because they've been paid off by Mr. Dean
DEAN: My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you. DEAN gets up and walks a grateful L.T. to the door, calling to his secretary as they go
RACHEL: How's the trout?

RACHEL: So you've said. DEAN hands her the envelope.
DEAN: So you've said. DEAN hands her the envelope.
RACHEL: I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
DEAN: Other than Brill.
RACHEL: Other than me.
DEAN: Why would I
RACHEL: Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a
DEAN: I'd probably like Brill if I ever got to

DEAN: That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
DEPINTO: This is fucked. You don't know who's in that
DEAN: You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
DEPINTO: You're goddam right you jumped the gun.

DEPINTO: I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
DEAN: Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.

DEAN: I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
FRANKIE: ( to SAL ) What'd this guy say his name was?
SAL: This is Bobby Dean, the Jew lawyer who squeezed DePinto.
DEAN: Actually, that's not true.
SAL: You didn't squeeze DePinto?

FRANKIE: Well we'd sure like to help you.
DEAN: You would?

DEAN: DEAN smiles.and after a moment, so does RACHEL.
RACHEL: When I need to reach Brill, I chalk the mailbox on 14th and Main.
DEAN: Jesus! What?! You want money?!
MAN: Shut the fuck up. Hands frisk DEAN. Up and down the legs, behind the back and chest. A wallet is removed, ID's looked at - then returned. DEAN turns to see A MAN, early 50's. He sweeps a signal frequency locator over DEAN's body. The needle reacts at DEAN's foot.
MAN: ( gesturing ) Your shoe.
DEAN: My shoe?
MAN: Gimme the shoe. DEAN complies with the strange request as the MAN flips out a knife.
DEAN: Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field. My name doesn't matter. CLOSE ON DEAN's HEEL - a hollow compartment reveals a miniature tracking device. The MAN removes it, then returns the shoe.

"BRILL": No. In back like you're a customer.
"BRILL": What happened?
DEAN: It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone. "BRILL" eyes the mirror. A BLACK CHEVY appears several car lengths behind.
"BRILL": DePinto's dead.
DEAN: Oh Jesus.
"BRILL": They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about "BRILL" starts to weave in and out of traffic. He looks in the mirror - the Chevy's also weaving several cars I don't know anything about Zavitz.
DEAN: I don't know anything about Zavitz.
"BRILL": You said he was behind an extortion extortion scheme. "BRILL" whips the cab around a corner, accelerating.
DEAN: extortion scheme. "BRILL" whips the cab around a corner, accelerating.
"BRILL": And you were the last one to talk to him.
DEAN: What'd he say to you?
"BRILL": What'd he say to you?
DEAN: What'd he give to you?
"BRILL": What'd he give to you?
DEAN: Don't bullshit me, I can save your I'm telling you, I The ride from hell gets worse as "BRILL" screeches another turn. The car ahead stops and "BRILL" screeches past on two wheels.

"BRILL": He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
DEAN: Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros. "BRILL" takes an impossible left into another alley. The Chevy follows. "BRILL"'s good. The guy in the Chevy's better.
"BRILL": Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else
DEAN: Someone else?
"BRILL": Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know. The cab is rear-ended hard by the Chevy. Their necks snap back from the force.
DEAN: Who are you calling?! WHACK! "BRILL" back-hands DEAN with his fist, knocking him silly as WHAM!the cab's rear-ended again.
"BRILL": ( trying again ) This is 209! Does anyone copy?!
WOMAN: Look out! He's got a gun! They back away as DEAN gets to his feet and looks around. Off to the side he sees the Chevy, waiting like a coiled snake. DEAN limps into the crowd. He rounds the corner to ANOTHER STREET and now he's running with all he's got left.
STACY: ( into phone )
DEAN: ( into phone ) Stacy, don't hang up.
STACY: Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
DEAN: I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken yesterday.
STACY: I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken yesterday.
DEAN: I know, but listen
STACY: Was that doctored-up, too?
DEAN: No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
STACY: I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
DEAN: I know.
STACY: I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts
DEAN: It wasn't me.

DEAN: Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit
STACY: My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be A hand suddenly clicks down the phone hook. DEAN turns to see a MAN, late 50's, gruff and alert. It's the guy driving the Chevy.
MAN: Put the phone down. Do as I say. DEAN does nothing, temporarily frozen. A pistol jabs him hard.
DEAN: Alright, alright DEAN replaces the phone. The man removes DEAN's gun. Nearby, two PEOPLE chat at a restaurant hostess desk, Move to the elevators. DEAN does but is suddenly redirected through a roof- access door.

BRILL: It's a SAT-tracker.
DEAN: I don't know what that means.
BRILL: Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
DEAN: I don't know what that means.
BRILL: 230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
DEAN: I don't know what that means.
BRILL: It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
DEAN: Why are they after
BRILL: If I knew, they'd be after Which they probably are right now. Wait. What do I do?
DEAN: Wait. What do I do?
BRILL: Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were.that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow. A helicopter hovers near the Washington Monument. BRILL eyes it cautiously.
DEAN: Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
BRILL: They're spooks.
DEAN: I don't know what that
BRILL: Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
DEAN: I don't know
BRILL: No shit.
DEAN: What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my life?!
BRILL: Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
DEAN: What if
BRILL: Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even. BRILL turns to leave
DEAN: ( blocking the exit door ) What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
BRILL: And you won't. Now move
DEAN: I'll pay you.
BRILL: ( taking out his pistol ) They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
DEAN: I've got a hundred-thousand dollars in jewelry in a safe-deposit box under a third party name. BRILL looks at the ground. Torn.
BRILL: ( pause ) If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of ( giving DEAN his pistol ) And take this.
DEAN: I swear to God I'll shoot.
DEAN: Go ahead. I hear you fine. The door pushes in
HICKS: I don't fuckin' 301 to all units. Everyone out! Now! We'll take him at the hospital.
DEAN: Tell him to stop the ambulance.
PARAMEDIC: Whoa there, fella. Just take it easy.
DEAN: Tell him to stop the ambulance.
PARAMEDIC: Now you're a little shaken up, but we're gonna get you on your feet in DEAN whips out his pistol and shoves it in the PARAMEDIC's face
DEAN: Thank you.
DEAN: ( under his breath ) I hate these guys.
HICKS: He's clever. He had help.
REYNOLDS: He's clever? He had help? No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
HICKS: No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.

REYNOLDS: I don't care if he's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his lap. I want the tape and I want him. Now is A WAITER with a tray steps out onto the terrace.
WAITER: Puffed cheese?
REYNOLDS: No thank you.
WAITER: I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with
REYNOLDS: Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
WAITER: Then let's assume I don't.
REYNOLDS: Then let's assume I don't.
WAITER: Yes sir. The WAITER goes back inside.
REYNOLDS: ( into phone ) Now is that clear?
WAITER: Yes sir. REYNOLDS disconnects, breathes deeply, and goes back to the party.
DEAN: No answer. DEAN drifts through the living room. A lamp is knocked over on the floor. DEAN keeps moving into the bedroom. He stops in the doorway - eyes fixed inside. DEAN'S POV: RACHEL lies on her stomach, naked in bed.
DEAN: ( approaching )
DEAN: Oh God DEAN wants to throw up but holds it down. Then, under a night table, he sees a shirt. He grabs it. DEAN'S POV: An oxford button-down. The inside collar is stamped with a dry-cleaner's marker reading: R. DEAN. Panic overtakes horror as DEAN quickly searches for anything else of his that may have been planted inside the apartment. Under the bed - a cufflink. In the bathroom - a hairbrush. On the desk - documents with his name on them. DEAN shoves everything into a garbage bag. Grabbing a towel, he retraces his steps, wiping his prints from everything he touched. Exiting, he wipes off the doorknob as A NEIGHBORS DOOR OPENS. A COUPLE stumbles out, laughing, kissing.and noticing DEAN leaving Rachel's condo.
DEAN: ( whispering ) It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
JERRY: It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
DEAN: It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.

DEAN: To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
JERRY: Bobby, you're in way over your head.
DEAN: Go to 'em, Jerry.
JERRY: I have a family.
DEAN: So do I! JERRY looks at the ground for a long moment.
JERRY: I'm sorry, man.
DEAN: No. No, it's okay. DEAN starts to leave.
JERRY: Bobby? Piece of advice?
DEAN: Turn yourself in.
JERRY: Turn yourself in.
DEAN: Go fuck yourself.
JERRY: Go fuck yourself.
DEAN: Go fuck yourself.
STACY: DEAN's hand cups her mouth as he pulls her into a pantry closet.
DEAN: ( barely a whisper ) Listen to me. The house is bugged. So we gotta be quiet, okay?
STACY: Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
DEAN: Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
STACY: Just reporters.
DEAN: I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
STACY: This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
DEAN: I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
STACY: What happened to your head?
DEAN: I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things electronically. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway. STACY gently touches his forehead where he's been cut.
STACY: Does that hurt?
DEAN: She grabs him and kisses him. The kiss lasts a good long time before STACY smacks him on the arm
STACY: She grabs him and kisses him. The kiss lasts a good long time before STACY smacks him on the arm
DEAN: She grabs him and kisses him. The kiss lasts a good long time before STACY smacks him on the arm

DEAN: You opened the thing?
STACY: The lingerie.

DRIVER: She's off location with a friend.
TRACY: ERIC looks up.
ERIC: Do I know you?
DEAN: Do I know you?
ERIC: Where've you been?
DEAN: Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
ERIC: Are you and mom getting a divorce?
DEAN: No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens Who won the fight?
ERIC: Who won the fight?
DEAN: Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
ERIC: Did you take allout of those Christmas bags I brought home last week. ERIC hangs his head.busted.then shouts to a GROUP OF KIDS on the playground.
DEAN: Did you take allout of those Christmas bags I brought home last week. ERIC hangs his head.busted.then shouts to a GROUP OF KIDS on the playground.
ERIC: ( shouting )
DYLAAAAN!!: DYLAN comes trotting over, carrying his backpack.
DYLAN: Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
DEAN: Dylan, I was just asking Eric if
DYLAN: Oh, God, I knew we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just sitting there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
DEAN: ( pause ) You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan. It was broken when we found it, I swear. I tried fixing it for you. I even put in new batteries. ( pulling out the GameBoy ) The screen scrambles whenever you boot up. I'd try to get your money
DYLAN: It was broken when we found it, I swear. I tried fixing it for you. I even put in new batteries. The screen scrambles whenever you boot up. I'd try to get your money DEAN eyes the pieces of the GameBoy, knowing that somewhere in the puzzle of plastic and chips is the key to his problems.
BRILL: ( whispering ) Get dressed. We're leaving.
DEAN: ( whispering ) You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
BRILL: Move it.
BRILL: I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
DEAN: And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate
BRILL: I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
DEAN: We said a hundred.
BRILL: The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
DEAN: ( agreeing )
BRILL: Did you call anyone?
DEAN: What do you mean?
BRILL: I mean did you call anyone.
DEAN: Look, my wife is understandably
BRILL: I called my wife!
DEAN: I called my wife!
BRILL: What'd I tell you?
DEAN: I didn't use my name.
BRILL: What'd I tell you?
DEAN: I called from a payphone!
BRILL: What'd I tell you?
DEAN: You told me no calls.
BRILL: I told you no calls. BRILL does a bootleggers U-turn. Several cars pass by in the opposite direction.
DEAN: You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the I didn't use my name.
BRILL: You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the I didn't use my name.
DEAN: I didn't use my name.
BRILL: Oh, I'll bet scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice! BRILL turns off the headlights, does another U-turn, pulls off on an emergency road and stops. He turns off the engine, rolls down the window, looks up into the night sky and listens. BRILL's POV: A cloudy night. Silent except for the water and a distant fog-horn. No sounds of aircraft.
DEAN: ( looking up as well ) I don't hear anything. ( on BRILL's silence ) Maybe you're wrong.
BRILL: A hundred and fifty.
DEAN: How do you know so much?
BRILL: None of your business.
DEAN: You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
BRILL: I was a traffic analyst. DEAN gives him a look that says, "I don't know what that means".
DEAN: How'd you get around the tap orders?
BRILL: They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic. Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we How'd you have the manpower to
DEAN: ( climbing back in ) How'd you have the manpower to
BRILL: ( driving again ) Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan every phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints.whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
DEAN: That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
BRILL: That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
DEAN: Why'd you leave?
BRILL: It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to Ramparts and split.
DEAN: They come after you?
BRILL: ( shrugging it off ) Well.there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.
DEAN: Looks like Detroit.
BRILL: Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
BRILL: I call it the jar. No phone or utility lines going in. BRILL opens a side door revealing a mini-generator. He pushes the start button. The generator HUMS to life.
BRILL: Self-contained. Unplugged from the Nothing for a wire bug to piggy- back in on. That leaves only transmitters and signal sweep for Now let's see what we got. DEAN tosses the paper bag to BRILL, who empties its contents ( the pieces of the GameBoy ) on to the table.
BRILL: That is one ugly sunrise.
DEAN: ( pause ) It really is. ( pause ) Did you find anything?
BRILL: ( beat ) Take a walk with me.
DEAN: The NSA killed him.
BRILL: The NSA killed him.
DEAN: Jesus. Do you have proof?
BRILL: Well, actually, Could you walk a little faster please.
DEAN: What's going on?
BRILL: They're here.
DEAN: In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.

DEAN: 'Kay, well, could you walk faster, INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS JONES and THREE MEN are huddled in a duct.
JONES: Move it. JONES and the three men start down the corridor, guns EXT. THE SECOND WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS DEAN and BRILL are kneeling beside the Chevy, letting the air out of the tires.
BRILL: Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
DEAN: And with that, THE FIRST WAREHOUSE EXPLODES, sending a fireball of debris in all directions.
DEAN: What the fuck?!
BRILL: They shouldn't have come without calling first. BRILL jumps into the Chevy, turns the key and the engine ignites. DEAN leaps in. BRILL stomps on the gas and tires screech. The Chevy hurtles through the warehouse toward a shut garage door. BRILL clicks a remote. The door rises. OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - The Chevy roars outward, screams around a corner, then speeds down a road lined with warehouses. DEAN looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a Saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road.
BRILL: Where's your gun? They pass an area with no warehouses. The Saturn turns, heading straight at them.
DEAN: Back at the warehouse. The Saturn pulls on the road behind them. The MAN in the Saturn leans out and fires an assault rifle. The side window by Dean's head shatters. BRILL one-hands the pistol and checks the load.
DEAN: ( re: the pistol ) Gimme that.
BRILL: You sure?
DEAN: You're driving.
BRILL: Those are Feds.
DEAN: ( taking the pistol ) I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
FIRES: The rear window EXPLODES. DEAN pops up and fires three quick, well-placed rounds. The Saturn swerves and drops back. BRILL's impressed. DEAN looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an iron cross-bar. BRILL, unfazed, pushes the Chevy faster. Beam or no beam, he's going through.
BRILL: Think we let out enough air?
DEAN: ( realizing ) Oh my God.
BRILL: We lost 'em.
DEAN: That wasn't so hard.
BRILL: Let's not do the tire thing anymore, Yeah, I can see where that'd He stops talking. He hears ROTOR THUMPS as a black HELICOPTER appears over a fog-laced hillside, swooping down. BRILL floors it. The helicopter drops in closer as BRILL swerves back and forth while taking a curve at 70- plus on flapping tires. A helicopter SHARP-SHOOTER aims with an M-16. A spray of high-powered slugs suddenly rip into the Chevy's hood. The engine starts knocking.

A spray of high-powered slugs suddenly rip into the Chevy's hood. The engine starts knocking.
BRILL: These guys are incredibly persistent.
DEAN: Tell me about it. The road straightens. Up ahead, a tunnel. More bullets slice the hood. Radiator fluid starts hissing. The Chevy starts dying. BRILL stomps the pedal, squeezing out every last kick of horsepower. Rubber flaps. Tires shred. Steam hisses. Bullets fly. The helicopter swoops in lower and lower for the kill shot.
BLAM!: EXT. INSIDE THE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS BRILL tries steering but metal wheels on concrete don't work. The car shimmies like it's on ice. Sparks fly as they bash into the tunnel wall, grinding to a stop.
BRILL: We're not gonna hurt you.
DEAN: We're not gonna hurt you.
BRILL: Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
DEAN: Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
BRILL: Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
DEAN: No he won't.
BRILL: We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you
DEAN: We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you
DEAN: Actually, I don't have two-hundred Drive the damn car! DEAN slides into the driver's seat, drops it in gear and goes. The Dodge erupts from the tunnel. Up ahead, the Saturn and another car approach fast in the opposite lane, speeding toward the tunnel's opening. The car's fly by, unaware of DEAN and BRILL passing in the Dodge. The Dodge continues on, fading into the fog.

HICKS: We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
REYNOLDS: We believe?
HICKS: Well.his real name's Edward Lyle.
REYNOLDS: Yes sir.
HICKS: Yes sir.
REYNOLDS: You're kidding me.
HICKS: No sir.
REYNOLDS: Dean's with Lyle.
HICKS: And they have the video. That's So they know everything.
REYNOLDS: So they know everything.
HICKS: If they've looked at the video.
REYNOLDS: Oh, let's assume that they have.
HICKS: If he's with Lyle it means he's got Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a six-hundred billion dollar organization! Now goddammit, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now! REYNOLDS walks off leaving HICKS to ponder his fate.
REYNOLDS: Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a six-hundred billion dollar organization! Now goddammit, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now! REYNOLDS walks off leaving HICKS to ponder his fate.
BRILL: Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get near the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
DEAN: What about newspapers and magazines?
BRILL: Same thing?
DEAN: So what do we do now?
BRILL: I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
DEAN: What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
BRILL: It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
DEAN: What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
BRILL: The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be looking for those moves.
DEAN: Well how do
BRILL: for and I'm telling you. The car radio is playing a newscast.
DEAN: What if we put it on the internet?
BRILL: Have you seen how fuckin' slow the net is? It'd take ten minutes to unload enough video so that people know what they're seeing, and it'd take the NSA maybe 40 seconds to see it coming down and shut down the access.
BRILL: ( reconsidering ) But maybe if there were no phone
DEAN: Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
BRILL: Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
DEAN: What if
BRILL: If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the What if
DEAN: What if
BRILL: They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
DEAN: What if
BRILL: What if
DEAN: What if we just fucked with 'em?
BRILL: ( pause ) Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
DEAN: Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
BRILL: A MONTAGE OF EVENTS:
DEAN: A MONTAGE OF EVENTS:
BRILL: A MONTAGE OF EVENTS:
DEAN: We'll play the NSA's game only we'll play it badly.
BRILL: We'll have to re-stock some basics.
BRILL: Bugs, frequency scanners, contact mics, transmitters, pin-holes, fiber optics
BRILL: What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
DEAN: I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond INT. TAURUS - DAY DEAN drives while BRILL sits with his open PC lap-top connect to his cellular phone.
BRILL: INT. TAURUS - DAY DEAN drives while BRILL sits with his open PC lap-top connect to his cellular phone.
BRILL: A 'modified' OKI 900 interfaced with a lap-top creates an enormously powerful tool. I got into the software, did some code re-writing and turned it into one of the best scan-looking systems around. CLOSE ON SCREEN - A street map appears with positions of the network's relays. Lines appear indicating all in-progress cellular calls along with their locations.
BRILL: ( disconnecting ) Need a place to stay for the weekend? A new TV? ( BRILL has repeated the process )
DEAN: All from a hundred dollar scanner at Radio Shack. But it's time for BRILL dials his computer into a new line. TONES and COMMANDS fly quick as Brill's computer modems into another.
BRILL: All from a hundred dollar scanner at Radio Shack. But it's time for BRILL dials his computer into a new line. TONES and COMMANDS fly quick as Brill's computer modems into another.
DEAN: What are you dialing?
BRILL: AmeriTech's data-base. There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
BRILL: A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
SENATOR ALBERT: Not 'till later tonight. We're going to the campus now. I'll call you after I've checked in. I love you too, dear.
DEAN: ( into concealed sleeve mic ) She just left.
CHRISTA: ( into phone ) Can you send someone up right away. I'm having a problem with my TV. It's screeching and I ( beat ) It's screeching and I
SENATOR ALBERT: What happened to you last night? PATRICK reaches in his case and pulls out one of Brill's listening bugs and hands it to ALBERT who puts on his eyeglasses.
PATRICK: Christa found it last night attached to her TV. It's a listening device.
SENATOR ALBERT: A bug?
PATRICK: SENATOR ALBERT
SENATOR ALBERT: Jesus H.
PATRICK: We should everything checked. There's a company in Cambridge called Baudmore. They're discreet. Seated next to ALBERT's table is DEAN, unnoticed as he sips coffee, skims news, and eavesdrops on their MURMURS with a small, concealed parabolic mic and ear- Well get somebody down here today. I don't know what the hell this is all about.
SENATOR ALBERT: Well get somebody down here today. I don't know what the hell this is all about.
DEAN: ( into sleeve mic ) He's going into the payphone outside the restaurant. It's a Cambridge company called Baudmore. ( into sleeve mic ) Got it. ( into phone ) Baudmore Consultants.
BRILL: ( into sleeve mic ) Got it. ( into phone ) Baudmore Consultants.
BRILL: ( into phone ) Baudmore Consultants.
PATRICK: Is Jerry Delsano in?
BRILL: Who's calling?
PATRICK: It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name
BRILL: Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name
PATRICK: The thing is.it really can't wait.
BRILL: My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
BRILL: ( removing the transmitter ) Oh yeah. Got another one here.
BRILL: Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
SENATOR ALBERT: Well then who can?
BRILL: Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
SENATOR ALBERT: What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
BRILL: The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but
SENATOR ALBERT: What are you saying?
BRILL: Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
SENATOR ALBERT: Law enforcement?
BRILL: FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
SENATOR ALBERT: Are you sure about this? BRILL unwraps a towel revealing the grease-covered NSA tracker he removed from Dean's BMW.
BRILL: I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
SENATOR ALBERT: Oh my God.
BRILL: Tracks your location to the inch and works directly withyou know.
SENATOR ALBERT: With what?
BRILL: With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator.
SENATOR ALBERT: ( shaking BRILL's hand ) Neil, thank you for your help.
BRILL: PATRICK escorts BRILL out of the RV. The SENATOR, fuming, opens a book, looks up a phone number and punches it into his phone.
SENATOR ALBERT: ( into the phone ) This is Sam Albert. Put me through to Langley. Dick Marshal's office.
BRILL: Albert's primed. We'll let him stew for a day and then drop the tape. BRILL looks over at the WELL-DRESSED MAN.
DEAN: He came in four minutes ago.
BRILL: ( pause )
COP: One-Lincoln-Nine. In pursuit of two suspects, one matching description of Robert Dean, wanted in connection with a homicide. Suspects northbound EXT. BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS Through alleys, down streets, under an overpass, down a one-way street, barely missing a head-on as they roar into a rail-yard traversing the waterfront. BRILL's at his best, putting distance between himself and the cops at every turn. Finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead-end. BRILL slams into reverse. They screech backward, tires Too late. The squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing them in. BRILL hits the brakes. He looks back at the dead-end and sees an empty flat-bed trailer with a ramp. BRILL gives it everything. If they can get enough speed and hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing Feeling lucky?
BRILL: Feeling lucky?
DEAN: Not particularly, no. They hit the ramp full speed. The front end bottoms at the Taurus bounces skyward. Tires clip the wall as the car flips and smashes into a parked rail-car filled with coal. They aren't going anywhere. Back in the alley, the squad car skids to a stop. A ROOKIE climbs from his car, leaps the wall, draws his gun and nears. Inside the Taurus, the windows are shattered. Steam hisses, gasoline drips and coal is everywhere. DEAN shimmies out through a broken side window. He barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so. His foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal, which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him.
DEAN: ( to BRILL ) I'm stuck. Help me out.
COP: ( on waist radio ) One-Lincoln-Nine, suspects TA'd into a coal car at the Fullbright rail-yards. Requesting back-up, fire and ambulance.
JONES: ( flashing ID ) FBI. What do you got?
COP: Two murder suspects. One's wounded, the other's maybe dead.
JONES: Thank you. KRUG draws his silenced pistol and matter of factly shoots the COP dead.
JONES: ( to KRUG ) Check inside.
KRUG: ( to BRILL as he searches. ) I hate doin' cops, I really do. You I won't mind. Didn't mind that Rachel Banks. Didn't mind doin' her one bit. ( seeing DEAN's shoe ) Your lawyer friend buried over there?
KRUG: Fuck him, he's dead in two minutes. Find Dean. JONES starts to back out, just as the Taurus's cigarette lighter pops out. BRILL grabs it. KRUG eyes the glowing lighter. Then he eyes BRILL. BRILL ignites the gas. WA-WOOMFF!! A fireball explodes, consuming all - the car, BRILL, KRUG. JONES is blown off his feet from the concussion.
JONES: ( scrambling away ) I just came from my office at Langley. Senator Albert called me
SHAFFER: I got the same call at the Bureau. He's upset.
REYNOLDS: About what?
MARSHAL: About what? Do I
REYNOLDS: We're not stupid, Reynolds.
MARSHAL: We're not stupid, Reynolds.
SHAFFER: We're not stupid, Reynolds.
MARSHAL: The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
SHAFFER: This guy's carrying the the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
MARSHAL: You have any idea what kind of position this
SHAFFER: He's carrying the damn
REYNOLDS: We're not doing He thinks we're stupid.
MARSHAL: He thinks we're stupid.
SHAFFER: He found an NSA SAT tracker on his motor home today.
REYNOLDS: It's not ours.
MARSHAL: It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
SHAFFER: I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
REYNOLDS: What about
REYNOLDS: Explain that.
HICKS: Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
REYNOLDS: What about the tape?
HICKS: We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
REYNOLDS: And if it wasn't? ORGAN MUSIC can be heard as REYNOLDS snaps his phone shut.
PRIEST: The Lord said: I leave you peace, my peace I leave you. Let us now, in the spirit of these holidays, turn to our neighbors and offer them a sign of peace. REYNOLDS stands in a pew beside his TWO DAUGHTERS and his WIFE. He turns to those immediately around him, shaking their hands.
REYNOLDS: Peace be with you.Peace be with you. A disguised DEAN takes REYNOLDS hand and shakes it.
DEAN: Merry Christmas. It's me.
REYNOLDS: Do I know you?
DEAN: I'm Robert Dean. Within twelve hours, you're gonna be in jail. Peace be with you. REYNOLDS is dumbstruck.
PRIEST: Let us now offer up thanks to the Lord our God in the words our Father gave us.
CONGREGATION: Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallow'd be thy name
DEAN: ( into phone ) I've re-routed the call. They can't trace it.
STACY: ( into phone ) Are you sure you're safe?
DEAN: ( into phone )
TECHNICIAN: Got it!
REYNOLDS: INTERCUT WITH: INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS HICKS is on the phone.
HICKS: Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
REYNOLDS: Do you have visual?
HICKS: Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve What's your ETA?
REYNOLDS: What's your ETA?
HICKS: Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
REYNOLDS: He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place. Kill him now.
HICKS: The fuck is this?
DISPATCHER: Nine-one-one emergency.
DEAN: Yeah, I think I'll stay where I am.
TECHNICIAN: ( into radio ) 201 to First Team. Pull out. We got the cops.
DAVIS: Fuck me!
JONES: What'd you do?
DAVIS: It came off in my hand!
TECHNICIAN: ( over radio ) Get outa there, guys!
DAVIS: HICKS smiles.and now he starts laughing a little.
JONES: What's so fuckin' funny? HICKS motions to a framed picture over the fireplace.
HICKS: It's over. We've been fucked with our pants on. The framed picture is of Senator SAM ALBERT and CHRISTA
COP #1: POLICE! FREEZE! HICKS doesn't move, DAVIS freezes like a deer in headlights, JONES stares with cold, dead eyes.
POLICE! FREEZE!: HICKS doesn't move, DAVIS freezes like a deer in headlights, JONES stares with cold, dead eyes.
COP #2: DROP THE WEAPONS! NOW! Two more COPS arrive. JONES and DAVIS drop their guns.
COP #1: ON THE GROUND! NOW! FACE THE FLOOR! They do so. COPS THREE and FOUR go room to room making sure no one else is lurking. In the bedroom, they find the briefcase. Inside the briefcase listening bugs, installation equipment and compromising photos of the Senator with Christa.
COP #2: Ma'am, is this your apartment?
CHRISTA: What happened?!
COP #1: Would you step out in the hallway for a moment, ma'am.
CHRISTA: Oh God.
COP #2: Please. We'll be right with you. CHRISTA backs slowly out of the apartment and into
CHRISTA: Who are you?
DEAN: My name's Robert Dean.
ALBERT: I understand we have a problem.
PATRICK: Senator, there were some things I couldn't tell you over the phone.
CHRISTA: Senator, there were some things I couldn't tell you over the phone.
ALBERT: What kinds of things?
PATRICK: Mr. Dean has a video tape from the hotel room in Boston.
ALBERT: ( pause ) I see.
DEAN: It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency I don't know what that means.
ALBERT: I don't know what that means.
DEAN: Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
ALBERT: So.how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
DEAN: I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
ALBERT: You're not.
PATRICK: Then what do you want from the Senator?
DEAN: I want him to look at a different tape. People have been killed. Lives have been ruined. Senator, I want you to look at this. And I want you to bring the fury of God himself upon this man. DEAN tosses the chip to ALBERT.
REYNOLDS: TECHNICIAN ( O.S. ) ( into phone )
REYNOLDS: ( into phone ) Well.what is it?
FBI AGENT: John Reynolds?
REYNOLDS: What the hell
FBI AGENT: You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say
ERIC: These guys are always making speeches.
STACY: It's an important speech, Eric. There's gonna be a vote today.
SENATOR ALBERT: ( on TV ) Today we face a threat to that creed. Certain individuals in our intelligence community believe they're entitled to examine lives in minute detail, and claim to do it in the name of the common good.
ERIC: If they're voting today, hasn't everyone pretty much made up their Actually, this man appears to have changed his mind dramatically.
STACY: Actually, this man appears to have changed his mind dramatically.
ERIC: VOICE ( O.S. )
ERIC: STACY and ERIC run to DEAN.
STACY: Is it over?
DEAN: It's over.
ERIC: How long can you stay?
DEAN: I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here. ERIC and DEAN hug.
STACY: Get ready for school, you're gonna be late.
ERIC: Is it okay to use the phone now?
DEAN: It's okay to use the phone.
ERIC: No "900" numbers. But ERIC has disappeared up the stairs.
DEAN: No "900" numbers. But ERIC has disappeared up the stairs.
STACY: It's really over?
DEAN: Albert's gonna get me my job back.
STACY: ( pause ) I'm sorry about Rachel.
DEAN: ( beat ) I wish you could've met.
STACY: A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
DEAN: A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
STACY: You did good. STACY points to the TV and DEAN watches for a moment.
ALBERT: ( on TV ) I've lived through the dark ages of Hoover's Watch-List and McCarthy's Witch Hunts - men who used moral crusades, fired by fear, to lay waste to our freedoms.
STACY: C'mon upstairs. I've got a Christmas present from Harrison's I want to show you. DEAN arrives as STACY takes him by the arm. They head upstairs as ALBERT continues on.
ALBERT: ( on TV ) Our intelligence communities presently monitor our phones, computers, financial transactions, medical histories.all this and more. Some of you may say, "Fine. I'm not a criminal and I have nothing to hide." Well God forbid we ever edge to tyranny. God forbid George Orwell's version of America becomes a reality. We are that close.
