EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES SKYLINE - DAY: A hot summer's day. Heat ripples distorts the towering shadowing buildings in the dense smog.
EXT. DARK OCEAN - NIGHT: TRAVELING SHOT low, across the top of the water's surface. Climb up the side of a massive, rusted supertanker, abandoned, years ago. Break over the railing to reveal a gigantic neon sign which screams "NEW LAS VEGAS." The supertanker has been transformed into a floating resort.
EXT. ALLEY - NEW LAS VEGAS, 2013 - NIGHT: An alley strangled with tourists, gamblers, hookers, hustlers, and con men - professional expatriates from the West mingling with excited visitors from all over the world.
EXT. CONTAINMENT WALL - FIREBASE SEVEN - L.A. - NIGHT: Searchlights sweep down across a column of policemen marching past a concrete wall. Camera begins to crane up the wall. Sound of roaring turbines. The howl of the Santa Ana wind.
EXT. SAN FERNANDO SEA - NIGHT: Water stretches into blackness. This was once the San Fernando Valley, but now it's all underwater. Pieces of debris - tops of buildings, the tail of an airplane, a radio tower - stick up above the surface. We can make out the letters of an old, half-sunken sign: "SAN FERNANDO VALLEY MALL"
EXT. THE WALL - NIGHT: The wall stretches to the northwest up to the Santa Susanna Pass. Portions of the 118 Freeway arch up out of the water.
EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - BEHIND THE WALL - NIGHT: Firebase Seven is a fortified base camp in the San Gabriel Mountains. It is a sprawling police complex with low concrete bunkers, gun emplacements, satellite communications, vehicles, troops, the works. ON A LARGE ASPHALT FIELD, opposite the main complex is Rotor City - row after row of black, multi-bladed, totally evil police battle helicopters parked like giant bugs on the ground.
INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT: A mammoth room filled with high-tech instrumentation. A glowing holographic map of L.A. fills one wall. Most of the control personnel have left their work stations and gather around TV sets all showing the Police Channel: a view of the helicopter transport sitting on the asphalt and the cheering crowds at the edge of Rotor City.
EXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT: The crowd of cops is growing to a frenzy of wild anticipation.

INT. PROTOTYPE DEFENSE LAB - SURVEILLANCE CAMERA: From the point of view of a surveillance camera. The lab is huge. Banks of processors, disk drives, test bays, prototype assembly areas. High tech. A group of government officials is being given a tour. Utopia, 17, the President's daughter is among them. Pretty, virginal, she wears a "True Love Waits" button on her flowered dress.
INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - CAMCORDER: From the point of view of a camcorder. Utopia stands inside the main cabin of a plush, government 747. In one hand she holds a black anodized box the size of a transistor radio with a button on top. In the other, a machine gun.
INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - VIRTUAL REALITY: Plissken stands manacled in the main cabin. A group of secret service men and congressmen watch as a flight attendance operates a camcorder. He's videotaping Utopia as she rants into the camera. She's pent up with such anxiety she's like a panther in a cage.

INT. SUBMARINE: Plissken braces himself as the cabin lurches, vibrates with the force.
EXT. THE WALL - NEWHALL PASS - NIGHT: A door in the wall opens, revealing the circulator tunnel. In a roaring explosion, the sub rockets out of the tunnel, shot from the wall like a cannonball. The submarine is airborne for several seconds, then drops down, and slams into the San Fernando Sea.
INT. SUBMARINE: Plissken is rocked with the impact. He guides the sub with hand controls. In front of him on a screen is a schematic diagram of the underwater landscape of the San Fernando Valley.

INT. SUBMARINE: Plissken twists his hand throttle, pouring on the power to 90%.
EXT. VENTURA & HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY INTERCHANGE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT: The sub rips through the water, faster and faster, goes into a hard bank to the right as the Ventura Freeway turns into the Hollywood. A sign at the edge of the Hollywood Freeway reads: "SPEED LIMIT 55". The sub screams past.
INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM: Brazen points to a readout showing the submarine's engine status.
INT. SUBMARINE: Plissken glances at the gauge. His nuclear turbine readout: green, moving to yellow, into red. He pushes it up to 102%.
EXT. UNDERWATER - UNIVERSAL CITY - THE BLACK TOWER - NIGHT: The sub smacks into the side of the Black Tower, powers through it, blasts out the other side through a window, tilting and wobbling. The sub rights itself momentarily but is slammed downward out of frame by a huge, dark, slimy object.

EXT. SHORELINE - CAHUENGA PASS - NIGHT: The sub explodes out of the water, lands belly first on a hillside with a hard thump.
INT. SUBMARINE: Plissken presses the hatch controls. The sub begins to slide backwards down toward the water.
INT. SUBMARINE: Plissken struggles, then rips open the hatch, scrambles out. The sub slowly slips backwards, down into the water. As the rear exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing.
EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT - RAIN: Plissken reaches old Mulholland Drive, now dark and desolate. Shells of houses stand nearby, black and empty. It has begun to rain.
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - NIGHT - RAIN: The rain pours down as Plissken makes his way down a steep incline.
EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL - NIGHT - RAIN: The rain is coming down in a torrent as Plissken makes his way down the hillside. Then, all at once, the rain lets up, then stops. The trees drip with moisture. Suddenly, a huge KATHUMP from above him. Plissken looks back. A huge mudslide is roaring its way down the hill toward him.
EXT. STAND OF TREES - NIGHT: The mudslide hits a flat area near a stand of trees, spreads out, slows. A completely mud-covered, black Plissken climbs out of the goo. He's dripping with it. His one good eye shines in the moonlight. He takes a couple steps toward the edge of the treeline when...
EXT. VINE AVENUE - NIGHT: The ruins of the Capital Records building. The rain has stopped again. Plissken is a lone figure walking along the street. In the distance, the sound of thumping music.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AT HIGHLAND - NIGHT: Pandemonium! Music blares. It's the old Supremes hit, "Love is Like An Itchin' In My Heart." Crowds dance in the street. It's like a block party. Black, Latino and Native American gangs celebrate. Plus the usual Hollywood Boulevard street traffic. Plissken moves through the carnival. Gorgeous hookers stand under the marquee of the ruined Chinese Theater. The marquee now reads:
"SAFE SEX", "NO CONDOMS NEEDED", "POLYPROPYLENE ORIFICES",: One of the hookers struts in front of Plissken.
EXT. LA BREA AND SUNSET BOULEVARDS - NIGHT: As the caravan turns west onto Sunset, Plissken blasts around the corner.

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUNSET AND BEVERLY DRIVE - NIGHT: Plissken moves into the intersection of Sunset and Beverly Drive. The ruins of the old Beverly Hills Hotel are ahead and to his right. He stops, stares down Sunset...
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT: Plissken is being carried down Rodeo Driveon the cross by a throng of surgical failures. They carry torches. Dressed in tatters. Their faces look only partially human sewn together raggedly.
50.: Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT: Plissken and Taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives chase. They stop at another small alley between two large buildings.
EXT. SMALL ALLEY - CUL DE SAC - NIGHT: It's long and narrow and completely enclosed by the buildings on either side. Suddenly Plissken and Taslima come to the end - a 75 foot high four-story building blocking the passageway to Wilshire.
INT. SECOND FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT: Plissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the balcony railing. A torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting hangs crooked on a wall.

Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain seeping with slime. They turn a corner into another tunnel, and run smack into a horde of patients. Instantly, the patients overpower them. Hands reach out and drag them down...
INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT: The golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage. The only light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle.
INT. SEWER RECLAMATION CENTER - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT: The cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control center. It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges and levers. A few are still working - most are broken and covered with dust and grime.
EXT. STREET UNDER SANTA MONICA FREEWAY OVERPASS - NIGHT: Plissken, gun in hand, sticks his head out of the open grate. Taslima follows. The Hispanic men who have climbed up out of the sewers load their weapons crates into various low-rider cars in heavily-armed groups. They rumble off into the night.

EXT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT: The caravan is starting up again. Wearing hot pants, a tank top and full-length mink coat, Utopia is escorted up a ladder by Cuervo Jones to the opened door of the Cadillac perched up on those monster truck wheels. The other Mescalitos mount up in their cars and motorcycles, and roar away from the terminal.

EXT. STORM DRAIN - WILSHIRE CANYON - NIGHT: Black oil-slicked water rushes in the moonlight, out of a huge opening in what appears to be a canyon wall.
YAAAAAAA!!!!: Of the tsunami sweeps under them. Pipeline and Plissken push off from the canyon floor just as the water shovels them upward like a cow catcher on a train. The water sweeps them up until they disappear under the blackness...

EXT. TOPS OF SKYSCRAPERS - NIGHT: The group of hang gliders sweep past the buildings. A bracero family is having dinner by candlelight two feet from the edge of a sheer precipice, as the side of the skyscraper they live in has been torn off. They wave to Plissken as he passes.
