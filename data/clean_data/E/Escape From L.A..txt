Break over the railing to reveal a gigantic neon sign which screams "NEW LAS VEGAS." The supertanker has been transformed into a floating resort.
KACLANG!: Out of the blackness above a huge steel net drops out of nowhere. The net slams down on top of PLISSKEN, trapping him, driving him down to the pavement with its weight. PLISSKEN struggles inside the net as black figures - United States Police Force Officers - rush toward him, grab the net, tightening it. More cops move for him as we SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK.
POLICE ANCHOR: He's been the Force's Most Wanted Man for 10 years. Convicted of 27 moral crimes. I can tell you, the excitement around here ( a great roaring skyward ) Here he comes!
BRAZEN: Commander Malloy. They're bringing him out, sir.
MALLOY: So we finally got him.
POLICE ANCHOR: Hold one! The door is opening!
POLICE ANCHOR: Hello, Plissken. Welcome to L.A.
POLICE ANCHOR: S.D. Bob Plissken. Special Forces, Black Light, Texas Thunder. Two Purple Hearts. Youngest man ever decorated by the Plissken's face remains so impassive as to be almost blank.
POLICE ANCHOR: You've been convicted of 27 moral crimes, Plissken. The murder of an Internal Revenue agent. The kidnapping of a bank president. Gun fighting for profit. The list goes on and on.
POLICE ANCHOR: You used to respect the law. Served your country like no man before you. Role model to a generation.
POLICE ANCHOR: What happened to you, war hero? You were the best we had.
POLICE ANCHOR: The whole world's watching. Every good and decent person who works and hard and follows the rules. What would say to them?
POLICE ANCHOR: What would you say to all of us who believed in you, who looked up to you, who thought you stood for right over wrong, good over evil? Be my guest. What do you have to say, Plissken?
PLISSKEN: ( beat ) Call me Snake.
BRAZEN: ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
MALLOY: Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
BRAZEN: Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
3RD MAN: Let's get this over with.
MALLOY: How you doin' Plissken? ( no reply ) You like the watch?
PLISSKEN: You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
3RD MAN: Get to it.
MALLOY: At 1030 hours Wednesday, a group of government officials began a tour of the Livermore Defense Lab. The President's daughter, Utopia, was among them.
MALLOY: An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to The 3rd Man reacts as the image in front of Plissken changes.
UTOPIA: ( to the camcorder ) To the American people - it is time to rise up and demand the surrender of the President and his corrupt theocracy of lies and terror.
MALLOY: At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane. We scanned the videotape on VR. Check it out.
UTOPIA: Today is Day One of a brand new world. The days of the empire are finished. ( beat ) To the President - my father, you know what this is.
UTOPIA: You know what it will do. Unless you abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, I will use it - on you.
CONGRESSMAN: Utopia, please. Give us the prototype. If something should happen -
UTOPIA: It will be in my hands - and the hands of my lover.
UTOPIA: Yes, my lover. My man. The only real man I've ever known. I'm on my way to his She moves to the rear of the main cabin, bends down, opens a small hatch in the floor, scrambles down.
MALLOY: Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
BRAZEN: Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time. ( hits a button ) Somebody else was in there with her.
MALLOY: Cuervo Jones. Shining Path. Peruvian terrorist. Runs the biggest baddest gang in L.A.
BRAZEN: Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences, then tried to erase them. She missed this fragment on the end of her last tape. Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR master data bank - and then went prowling around for innocent blood, someone vulnerable to corrupt. Utopia was lonely, looking for something to believe in.
PLISSKEN: Sad story. You got a cigarette?
MALLOY: Shut up, Plissken.
PLISSKEN: What's the little black box do?
MALLOY: Top secret. Only on a need to know.
PLISSKEN: And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
MALLOY: That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
PLISSKEN: So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm That's the deal.
MALLOY: That's the deal.
PLISSKEN: Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
3RD MAN: If you bring out the prototype, you'll receive a full pardon for every immoral act you have ever committed in the United States. Just like in '97. Remember New York, Plissken?
PLISSKEN: ( looks at him ) Who are you?
MALLOY: It's the President, for Christ's sake!
PRESIDENT: I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
PLISSKEN: I can see you're real concerned about your Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
PRESIDENT: Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
PLISSKEN: Well, I'll think it over.
PRESIDENT: You're running out of time.
PLISSKEN: I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there Well, enjoy it, war hero, cause you got 10 hours to live.
MALLOY: Well, enjoy it, war hero, cause you got 10 hours to live.
PLISSKEN: Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
MALLOY: Having second thoughts?
PLISSKEN: Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
MALLOY: You don't understand. It's already in you.
PLISSKEN'S FACE: As an image of the cigarette girl in New Las Vegas flashes suddenly. Her fingernail scratches his arm. He tightens.
MALLOY: The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
BRAZEN: It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
MALLOY: Of course there's an anti-toxin. Neutralizes the virus immediately upon ( beat ) We'll give it to you, but you have to do us this little favor.
PRESIDENT: Didn't think we were that stupid, did you?
MALLOY: We're holographs.
PLISSKEN: Get this crap out of me.
MALLOY: I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
PLISSKEN: ( beat ) Call me Snake.
BRAZEN: Very sweet little weapon. Core burner. Magnesium ammo. 500 extra rounds. ( moves on ) Two 9mm handguns. ( holds up a silver pill ) Oral projectile. Mouth dart. Hold it in your mouth for ten seconds, the coating dissolves, it becomes a weapon.
BRAZEN: Urolite. It'll stun the enemy for several Plissken picks up a small, computerized compass.
MALLOY: Tracer. Utopia has a kidnap chip implanted in her arm. You can locate her with this.
BRAZEN: This clips right onto your 9mm. Ammo enhancers. Like miniaturized grenades. Blows through anything.
MALLOY: L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
BRAZEN: Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
MALLOY: Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre.
PLISSKEN: I'll need to know more about this thing.
MALLOY: Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
PLISSKEN: Defense against what?
MALLOY: There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
MALLOY: Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
PLISSKEN: So what does this thing do?
MALLOY: All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
MALLOY: ( points to the open hatch ) You're going over by submarine. One-man submersible. Nuclear powered.
PLISSKEN: Where do I put ashore?
MALLOY: Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there. ( beat ) Once you go inside, you're on your own. ( beat ) You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you? ( beat ) We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
PLISSKEN: So you want me to take her out? ( Malloy nods ) Is that an order from the President?
MALLOY: Let's just say it's what's best for the By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
PLISSKEN: By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
MALLOY: A medical team will be standing by.
PLISSKEN: Not you?
MALLOY: KABLAMM! He fires, ripping hellish blasts at Malloy. There's no damage. Malloy laughs.
PLISSKEN: KABLAMM! He fires, ripping hellish blasts at Malloy. There's no damage. Malloy laughs.
MALLOY: Thought you might try that. First clip is filled with blanks. Goodbye, Plissken.
MALLOY: I'm here, Plissken.
PLISSKEN: She's in the green.
PLISSKEN: ( hits a switch ) MALLOY ( V.O. ) Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
PLISSKEN: 75% power.
MALLOY: Plissken, watch your speed. Lots of obstructions down there.
BRAZEN: His reactor's starting to overheat.
MALLOY: Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
PLISSKEN: I'm here.
PLISSKEN: It's history. I gotta go.
PIPELINE: Too bad about your boat, man. ( Plissken doesn't move ) Supposed to be some swells out here tonight. Big ones. ( beat ) You like to surf?
PIPELINE: You look kinda familiar. ( beat ) You hang out around here much?
PIPELINE: Hey, man. I know who you are. You're Snake Plissken. Man, I can't believe you're really here.
PIPELINE: Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
PLISSKEN: Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
PIPELINE: ( points ) Down that way.
PIPELINE: Be careful. Some real strange dudes hangin' out there these days.
PIPELINE: Hey Snake - what're you doin' around here, ( as Plissken disappears ) I heard they busted you up real good in EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL - NIGHT - RAIN The rain is coming down in a torrent as Plissken makes his way down the hillside. Then, all at once, the rain lets up, then stops. The trees drip with moisture. Suddenly, a huge KATHUMP from above him. Plissken looks back. A huge mudslide is roaring its way down the hill toward him.
SPINAL: Take cover, fool.
SPINAL: Let's take him.
SPINAL: Hey. I know you. Snake Plissken.
SPINAL: Hey, what's going down, Snake?
PLISSKEN: I'm looking for somebody.
SPINAL: Who ain't?
SPINAL: Say, is it true what they say about Cleveland, man?
SPINAL: Later, Snake. Thanks for the help. You can always shift down and mojo with us EXT. VINE AVENUE - NIGHT The ruins of the Capital Records building. The rain has stopped again. Plissken is a lone figure walking along the street. In the distance, the sound of thumping music.
"SATISFACTION GUARANTEED": One of the hookers struts in front of Plissken.
BLONDE HOOKER: It's winnin' time, baby. How about you and I do some celebrating?
PLISSKEN: What's going on?
BLONDE HOOKER: You must be new around here. ( beat ) You look familiar. Have I done you before?
PLISSKEN: What's happening?
BLONDE HOOKER: Easy, man, easy. It's Cuervo Jones' gang. Mescalito Justice. He's the big boss man 'round here tonight. ( whispers ) He's gonna take down the police and make 'em kiss his fine ass.
ON PLISSKEN: Coming right behind him are four Mescalitos on Harleys - chains, iron bars, and swords in their hands. Plissken stares up ahead.
PLISSKEN: As the other Mescalito riding behind him swings a chain. Plissken swings his. The two chains snap together, intertwining. Then Plissken squeezes his hand-brake. He screeches to a stop. The Mescalito keeps going, and is yanked over backward by his own chain, off the Harley. Finally the Harley flops over, skids, explodes. Plissken guns it again, takes off after the Cadillac.
THE HORSE: Plissken pulls himself up behind the Mescalito and wrestles for control of the mount. Plissken grabs the reins and wraps them around the Mescalito's neck, squeezing until his eyes burst. Plissken slams his arm against the Mescalito, throwing him off the saddle, bouncing onto the pavement.
THE BIKE: With one quick yank to the lasso, Plissken pulls the biker off, jumps on the bike and smacks the hell out of the horse's rump.
THE HORSE: Takes off down the street, dragging the biker by the neck.
THE CADILLAC: Speeds up as Plissken moves up to the Mustang five cars behind. He swings off the bike and jumps onto the trunk. Plissken climbs up to the roof, leaps on the hood, then jumps to the trunk of the car in front - leapfrogging, jumping to the next car, the next car.
MESCALITOS: Lean out their car windows, firing at him, but Plissken keeps moving toward the Cadillac.
CUERVO JONES: Snake Plissken.
PLISSKEN: As the bolas hit him, wrap around his neck, the balls thunking him in the face, sending him flying.
CUERVO JONES: Later, Snake. We finish it later.
PLISSKEN: Lies there for several beats, then climbs to his feet.
PLISSKEN: Stands alone in the deserted street. The ruins of a supermarket, cheap motels, liquor stores - all empty, desolate.
PLISSKEN: Where'd they go?
PLISSKEN: Where are they?
PLISSKEN: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
SENTRY: ( into walkie ) Specimen moving west on Sunset.
GATEKEEPER: ( beat ) Where are you going? ( no reply ) Are you here for the auction?
BEHIND PLISSKEN: Figures have suddenly moved out into the street, all with mismatched body parts - heads too large for their torsos, female body parts mixed with male heads, all sewn together with large, uneven stitches. Plissken is surrounded.
GATEKEEPER: Welcome to Beverly Hills.
TASLIMA: Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
PLISSKEN: Are you crazy?
TASLIMA: A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
TASLIMA: I can't believe I got caught. ( sighs ) I run with Midnight Jihad. Iranian gang. Only they kicked me out, cause I screw up sometimes. I forget stuff.
TASLIMA: I left my boyfriend's place tonight, took a wrong turn. ( sighs again ) Oh, Snake, I'm really kind of out of it OUT OF THE RED DOOR come more interns and nurses carrying surgical pans and pushing gurneys to collect dismembered body parts.
PLISSKEN: What are they?
TASLIMA: They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again. ( whispers ) Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
PLISSKEN: No screamin' shit.
TASLIMA: Oh no, it's the Doctor.
PLISSKEN: The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
TASLIMA: The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
THE DOCTOR: Stands in front of them. He raises his hands to quiet the crowd. He walks around the cross, admiring the beautiful bodies before him. He tickles the fine flesh with his right hand, which is made up of 10 gleaming scalpels which form a 360 degree cutting edge.
THE DOCTOR: I've never seen more beautiful specimens. There will be no auction tonight. These body parts will go to those who need them the most.
PLISSKEN: Turns his head sideways, to a small hidden pocket near his neck. With his teeth, he pulls out the silver mouth dart, slips it onto his tongue, closes his mouth.
THE DOCTOR: What a beautiful blue eye. It's a shame you only have one.
TASLIMA: Snake, help me.
SNAKE: I don't know.
TASLIMA: I don't know.
PLISSKEN: Don't follow me.
TASLIMA: You need help.
PLISSKEN: Like hell I do.
TASLIMA: Down this way.
PLISSKEN: This is a dead end. ( looks at her ) You took us into a dead end!
TASLIMA: I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
PLISSKEN: He follows Taslima through the window.
TASLIMA: Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
PLISSKEN: The what?
PLISSKEN: ( yelling ) Are you gonna stand there? Give me the Taslima starts to hand it to him. Both Plissken and the doctor fight to reach it. Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp. He blasts three times - each one hitting. The doctor shudders, rolls away.
PLISSKEN: How do we get out of here?
TASLIMA: Sewers. Come on.
TASLIMA: Down there.
TASLIMA: Snake - what is it?
PLISSKEN: How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
PENDEJO BOB: What're you doing in here?
PLISSKEN: Looking to get out.
PENDEJO BOB: Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
PLISSKEN: Which way?
PENDEJO BOB: You're Snake Plissken.
TASLIMA: Yes. Isn't he cool?
PENDEJO BOB: An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me Pendejo Bob.
PENDEJO BOB: Those damn patients are coming back. You'd better climb aboard.
PENDEJO BOB: I use the eye and the music to scare em off. They're so whacked out, man, it works great. Chased a whole bunch of em right off the edge there a few months ago.
TASLIMA: ( she peers over the side ) How far down does it go?
PENDEJO BOB: Don't know - never do hear em land. Earthquake opened it up.
PENDEJO BOB: I own this whole place. Used to work here in the old days. I was right in this room when the big one hit. What a mess. We were waist high in shit. ( turns proudly to them ) Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed at my post. Now it's all mine. I brought my whole family, my amigos, down here to live with me.
TASLIMA: Gun runners.
PENDEJO BOB: Hey, it's a living, baby.
PLISSKEN: Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil? ( looks at Taslima ) Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
TASLIMA: I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
PENDEJO BOB: Y'know, L.A.'s not such a bad place, Snake. We got our problems, sure - but this is paradise, man.
PENDEJO BOB: Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
PLISSKEN: Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
PENDEJO BOB: All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
PENDEJO BOB: Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway. Just follow the signs. Get off at the Lincoln Exit, turn left.
PENDEJO BOB: Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss. You're welcome down here anytime. Anytime at all.
TASLIMA: The freeway's over there. But, Snake - I don't think it's such a good idea.
TASLIMA: The freeways are dangerous.
TASLIMA: Goodbye, Snake.
TASLIMA: Sun's coming up in a few hours.
TASLIMA: UV's gonna be bad today. I have a friend who's got a place near here. We can crash there if you want, Snake. ( she moves close to him ) I'd love to take care of you. Make you feel good.
TASLIMA: I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
PLISSKEN: ( gestures to the cars ) What the hell is this?
TASLIMA: The freeway.
PLISSKEN: I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
TASLIMA: It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
TASLIMA: What are you gonna do in Venice?
PLISSKEN: Find Cuervo Jones.
TASLIMA: No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
TASLIMA: Run, Snake.They're coming.
PLISSKEN: She touches his hand and looks at him softly.
TASLIMA: I don't know.
FREEWAY EMBANKMENTS: From out of the heavy bushes along the freeway storm a dozen Mescalitos moving quickly - firing as they go. Behind them grinds an ancient garbage truck mounted with a 50-caliber machine gun. Atop the truck is Delgado. He wears a flame thrower on his back.
PLISSKEN: Returns fire, rolls under a car and begins crawling. All around him people jump out of their cars, begin firing back at the THE GARBAGE TRUCK Smashes through a rusting Volkswagen, heading straight toward him.
PLISSKEN: Reaches the edge of the freeway, dives for the bushes.
THE UNDERGROWTH: As the garbage truck bursts through. Delgado is behind the machine gun, blasting away, burning up the street. Bullets are flying everywhere as Plissken runs to the Cadillac and dives into the back seat. He's still not fully inside when Map To The Stars Eddie roars away in a blaze of rubber and smoke.
DELGADO: Takes aim with his flame thrower. KAWHOOSH!
PLISSKEN: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
PLISSKEN: Stop the damn car.
PLISSKEN: I said pull over.
PLISSKEN: Where is it?
PLISSKEN: Grits his teeth and gasps. His gun drops. Blood runs from four holes in his shirt. His face grows red as he fights for air.
BEHIND IT: Surrounded by Mescalitos with torches and guns, sits the former Bradley Terminal defaced with graffiti, the sign now reading:
CUERVO JONES: We'll see.
CUERVO JONES: Carrot juice? ( no response ) Laced with tequila, Snake. Good for you. ( no response ) Your health.
CUERVO JONES: You're coming out of it, Snake. It hurts real bad. ( beat ) That's good.

CUERVO JONES: Snake Plissken. American outlaw. So typical of American idealism. The old west, Snake.
CUERVO JONES: Man against the sky. The individual. Freedom. No wonder they hate you so much in America, Snake. You remind them of what they used to be.
CUERVO JONES: Here is the real L.A., Snake.
CUERVO JONES: The poor. The old. The lost. People without hope.

UTOPIA: Cuervo! LaToya Jackson just won Best Cuervo Jones reaches out to take the prototype from her. She holds on to it.
UTOPIA: You said I could hold it.

CUERVO JONES: You never heard of Snake Plissken?
UTOPIA: He doesn't look like his picture. ( frown ) I bet he's fake.
CUERVO JONES: Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
UTOPIA: Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
UTOPIA: CUERVO JONES Go on now. Do as I say.
CUERVO JONES: Go on now. Do as I say.
CUERVO JONES: I'm going to show her what it means to be a woman - for the first time in her pathetic little life. ( smiles ) Given her love, Snake. Everybody needs He moves slightly closer to Plissken - though not too close.
CUERVO JONES: You want to hook up with us? Join the revolution? We're all getting out of here tomorrow night. ( holds up the prototype ) We're gonna rule the world. Come with us, Plissken says nothing. His good eye glares.
CUERVO JONES: No? Too bad. Well, I told you we'd finish it later. So guess what? It's later.
DELGADO: You're mine now, Snake. All mine.
PLISSKEN: Plissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him. He just barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor.
CLANG!: Delgado is thrown sideways. Plissken runs, launches himself through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick right in Delgado's face. Delgado goes sprawling. One of the machetes CLANKS to the floor.
AS PLISSKEN: Approaches, ducks behind an old junked car.
THE REFEREE: Hands the ball to a Korean Dragon guard. The Korean Dragon dribbles the ball down court, into the corner and passes it off. The Korean Dragons can't get a shot off.
JAMAAL: Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland.
JAMAAL: Welcome aboard, Snake.
CUERVO JONES: The time is now. We are the strongest. If we go together, the others will come. ( beat ) We go for everything, Xi-Ping. But we go together. What do you say?
PLISSKEN: Realizes he's got to get to the other side of the court. He jumps into the huddle with Jamaal, peering at him with his one good, cold eye.
PLISSKEN: Your brother died owing me, so I'm taking it out in trade. I need a favor.
JAMAAL: Sure, Snake. Anything.
PLISSKEN: I need to get across the court now. without drawing attention to myself.
JAMAAL: Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore thumb. But we'll do what we can, Snake. Use the clock. Screen and roll. Now let's kick some butt!
JAMAAL: ( whispers ) You play much pick-up ball, Snake?
JAMAAL: Whatever happens, watch the shot clock, The referee blows his whistle. A Black Muslim guard inbounds the ball. The game is underway.
UTOPIA: It's that weird guy again.
JAMAAL: Snake! Shot clock!
THE BASKET: Swish. Nothing but net.
CUERVO JONES: That man in black. He's very dangerous.
CUERVO JONES: Yes. We gotta dump him.
CUERVO JONES: ( glances at the prototype ) I'm betting the cops sent him in. Man, I do not need this. I got a war to win.
PLISSKEN: Where are they going?
PLISSKEN: Not yet.
FORUM EXIST: The caravan picks up speed as it approaches the exit.
BLAM!: The front seat disintegrates. Metal, leather, padding fly everywhere. Cuervo Jones ducks against the door, covering his face with one hand, still grasping the wheel with the other.
KAWHUMP!: The entire front seat and floor underneath it fall down out of the Cadillac and hit the street below. The bodies of the driver and X- Ping flop under the monster wheels.
CUERVO JONES: Plissken and Utopia fly through the air, and land with a thud on top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve wildly. Cuervo Jones grabs the wheel, desperately tries to control the Caddy. but fails. The Cadillac careens off the street, slams into the palm tree, spins around and crashes into the remains of a hot dog stand.
UTOPIA: Lemme go.!
CUERVO JONES: Kill him, kill him.!
UTOPIA: My. father sent you. didn't he? ( beat ) He sent you to kill me.
UTOPIA: Didn't he? ( begins to cry )
PLISSKEN: Plissken sags, clicks the hammer back, holsters the gun. He stares at her.
PLISSKEN: Get out of here.
PLISSKEN: I said go!
UTOPIA: Don't take it back. Don't give it to him. Please. Let me have it.
PLISSKEN: What does this thing do?
UTOPIA: ( her eyes grow wide ) Plissken's shoulder explodes as a bullet tears through his flesh! He spins, drops the prototype.
KABLAM!: Plissken's shoulder explodes as a bullet tears through his flesh! He spins, drops the prototype.
KABLAM!: He fires again, hits Plissken's leg.
PLISSKEN'S BODY: Airborne. Falling through black space. Down, down, down, straight to hell below, until we can't see him anymore as the darkness swallows him up.
CUERVO JONES: Where is he?
CUERVO JONES: Give it to me.
CUERVO JONES: ( extends his hand ) Give it.
PROTOTYPE VOICE: ( tiny, filtered ) I am now armed and ready for use. Use extreme caution. The location of the effected blast area can only be determined by the orbital position of the SatStar Everyone in the tunnel is frozen, unable to move. Slowly Cuervo Jones picks up the prototype, stares at it, then breaks into a CUERVO JONES This is turning out to be my lucky day. ( stares coldly at Map To The Stars Eddie ) Get this asshole outta here.
CUERVO JONES: This is turning out to be my lucky day. ( stares coldly at Map To The Stars Eddie ) Get this asshole outta here.
UTOPIA: CUERVO JONES You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
CUERVO JONES: You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
UTOPIA: I tried.
CUERVO JONES: ( in her face ) Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you. ( screams ) ( shakes her ) He shoves her down the tunnel.
UTOPIA: He shoves her down the tunnel.
CUERVO JONES: Let's go.
CUERVO JONES: ( looks up ) Look, baby. They're all mine.
MALLOY: A sky full of enemy choppers on radar. Moving over the city to the southeast.
COM OFFICER: Commander - massive vehicle and troop movement on the ground. All major streets leading to the southeast.
PRESIDENT: What're they doing?
MALLOY: Getting ready to invade.
PRESIDENT: ( beat ) So where's Plissken?
DARKNESS: Creaking. The WHOOSH of something swinging through the air.
DARKNESS: Plissken's boot is hooked in a twisted wire mesh.
DARKNESS: And then Plissken swings like a pendulum, hanging from a long strand of wire mesh attached somewhere above in the blackness.
THE DARKNESS: Begins to reveal details: slimy walls. Below, a black pit of hell. Wind gushing.
PENDEJO BOB: Hey, Snake. You okay? ( unhooks the lariat ) I heard gunfire down here. ( begins to swing the rope ) Never been down this far before. ( swings the rope in a huge arc ) Grab this.
PENDEJO BOB: Now hang on.
PENDEJO BOB: Hey, Snake.where are you?
PLISSKEN: ( yells ) I'm in another opening. Storm drain. There may be another way up to you.
SNAP!: Suddenly the concrete bottom on which he stands gives way, cracks, And Plissken falls backward into the rushing water, and is pulled suddenly downstream into the drain, disappearing from sight.
PENDEJO BOB: Stands silently above, listening.
PENDEJO BOB: ( no reply ) Booming. The whole pit shudders, shaking. Another earthquake. Pendejo Bob drops the rope, turns and dashes away down the vibrating storm drain.
PLISSKEN: Emerges from the hole, slides out, tumbles down to a water-filled canyon bottom. He lies there for a moment, trying to focus his eye. Stabbing pain in his shoulder and leg. Finally he rises unsteadily to his feet, looks around, trying to get his bearings. He finds himself at the bottom of.
PIPELINE: Snake. Saw you at the game tonight. Great ( stares at him ) You look like shit.
PIPELINE: You feel those pre-shocks, Snake?
PIPELINE: Could be a big one comin' any minute Where's. Cuervo Jones.?
PLISSKEN: Where's. Cuervo Jones.?
PIPELINE: Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
PLISSKEN: Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
PIPELINE: Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
PLISSKEN: Take me there.
PIPELINE: You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need ( bends down, helps Plissken to his feet ) You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
PLISSKEN: Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that Pipeline points down the canyon to the east.
PIPELINE: Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that Pipeline points down the canyon to the east.
PIPELINE: She's connected with the Black Cowboys, and they don't take shit from nobody.
PIPELINE: Yo', man. It's a big one.
PIPELINE: Tsunami, Snake.
PIPELINE: Surf's up big time.
PIPELINE: Get ready, Snake. It's gonna be some kinda Plissken looks behind him.
PIPELINE: Let the front edge pick you up. Don't get on your board till it peaks.
PIPELINE: Don't lose it, man. You slip off your board and it's the Big Wipeout, you know what I mean?
PIPELINE: Hang on, Snake! ( yells )
YAAAAAAA!!!!: THE FRONT EDGE Of the tsunami sweeps under them. Pipeline and Plissken push off from the canyon floor just as the water shovels them upward like a cow catcher on a train. The water sweeps them up until they disappear under the blackness.
PIPELINE: Awesome, Snake. AWESOME, man!
PLISSKEN: ( to Pipeline ) See you later.
AS PLISSKEN: Stands up and leaps from the surfboard.
PLISSKEN: Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
PLISSKEN: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, Cease fire with the bullshit.
PLISSKEN: Cease fire with the bullshit.
CUERVO JONES: Abandon your firebases by 0500 hours. Have the news media standing by for my coronation. I'm arriving in style.
BRAZEN: He must be bouncing the signal from one of our communications satellites.
PRESIDENT: That means CableNet has already picked it up. This thing's going live all over the CUERVO JONES ( on the TV ) It's a brand new day comin' up this morning, and I'm just so proud to be leading the parade. See you soon, putos.
CUERVO JONES: ( on the TV ) It's a brand new day comin' up this morning, and I'm just so proud to be leading the parade. See you soon, putos.
MALLOY: The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. ( the President nods grimly ) Shall I begin evacuation?
PRESIDENT: Does he know how to activate it?
MALLOY: Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the What about Plissken? He could still be -
BRAZEN: What about Plissken? He could still be -
PRESIDENT: Forget him. He's dead.
MALLOY: That may not be true, Mr. President. ( beat ) He's one tough case. Plissken's been dead so many times I can't count. But he never stays down.
MALLOY: There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait for Plissken, or surrender. It's your The President sighs heavily.
SPINAL: ( eyes brightening ) Hershe - it's Snake Plissken.
PLISSKEN: I need a favor.
HERSHE: What's in it for me?
PLISSKEN: Wait a minute. I know that voice. ( beat ) You're Carjack Malone.
HERSHE: Not anymore.
SPINAL: You two know each other?
PLISSKEN: You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
SPINAL: ( astounded ) Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
PLISSKEN: Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
HERSHE: I was called away on urgent business, Don't lie to me.
PLISSKEN: Don't lie to me.
HERSHE: All right, so I made another deal.
PLISSKEN: I got a new deal for you.
PLISSKEN: You help me, you live.
SPINAL: I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
HERSHE: We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
PLISSKEN: I'm already dead.
HERSHE: ( long beat ) I see your point. What's the favor?
PLISSKEN: ( looks at his watch ) Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
HERSHE: Dream on, blue eye.
PLISSKEN: Say goodnight, Carjack.
HERSHE: Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
SPINAL: Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
HERSHE: Exactly what is this prototype? What does it do?
HERSHE: So whoever has it runs the show.
SPINAL: Only Cuervo's got it now.
PLISSKEN: How do you know all this?
HERSHE: So what's the deal, gorgeous?
PLISSKEN: We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
SPINAL: All of us?
PLISSKEN: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Me too?
PLISSKEN: ( stares at him hard ) We'll see.
HERSHE: Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
SPINAL: I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
PLISSKEN: The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
SPINAL: Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
PLISSKEN: Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
PLISSKEN: Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
HERSHE: I don't know, sounds thin to me.
PLISSKEN: You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
HERSHE: ( grim ) No, that sucks. ( beat ) How are we getting out?
PLISSKEN: I don't know yet.
SPINAL: You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
HERSHE: You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
MOJO DELLASANDRO: ( a soft voice ) Use the air.
MOJO DELLASANDRO: They're burning. Santa Anas. The night What're you talking about, Mojo?
SPINAL: What're you talking about, Mojo?
MOJO DELLASANDRO: Death from above.
PLISSKEN: Don't like it, don't come.
SPINAL: Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
HERSHE: My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
PLISSKEN: Yeah, kinda.
PLISSKEN: If he lets you get close enough.
HERSHE: The wind's up. Let's go.
HERSHE: See you in hell, Snake.
PLISSKEN: If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without With that Plissken launches himself off the deck, sailing out over open space, then down toward the street.
PLISSKEN: Gliding through the air, as the wind picks him upward. He arcs away from the street level, up toward the remains of the downtown skyscrapers. Behind him, one after another, the group takes off into the wind, diving, rising with the wind.
CUERVO JONES: They're simple people. They love a party. ( turns to Utopia ) We're gonna throw them one hell of a party when we get to America. Right?
CUERVO JONES: Put a smile on your face.
BIVOUAC: Cuervo Jones. Welcome, my Brother.
CUERVO JONES: Are you ready for the New World?
PLISSKEN: Glances at his wrist watch. Only 20 minutes left. Map To The Stars Eddie swings wildly over in his direction, manages to stabilize his glider for a few moments.
PLISSKEN: Is that what I think it is?
HERSHE: Snake. We need some kind of diversion.
KAWHUMP!: Map To The Stars Eddie crash lands into the ruins of a fast food restaurant - KACRUNCH!
CUERVO JONES: Would you please kill him for me?
BIVOUAC: My pleasure.
CUERVO JONES: You told me he was dead.
CUERVO JONES: Map To The Stars Eddie moves close to Cuervo, out of breath, looking like he may faint.
CUERVO JONES: ( long beat ) MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE ( stalling ) It's so good to see you again.
CUERVO JONES: Where's Plissken?
CUERVO JONES: You're stalling, Eddie. ( grabs him ) Talk, you little gringo!
CUERVO JONES: You've lied to me for the very last time.
PLISSKEN: She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
HERSHE: ( screams from the rear compartment ) Somebody get off!
SPINAL: ( glares at him ) All eyes quickly move to Map To The Stars Eddie.
KABLAM!: Bullets rip through the windscreen.
THE HELICOPTER: Begins sliding across the ground, skids grinding along the pavement, sparks flying - slowly at first, now picking up speed.
HERSHE: We're not gonna make it over the fuckin' The helicopter moves right toward the edge of the Matterhorn, 15 feet. 10. Plissken tries to maneuver out of the way. 8 feet. 5.
COM OFFICER: Aircraft leaving the island, sir. It's passed into restricted space, heading this Malloy, the President, and Brazen exchange glances.
PRESIDENT: Is it Plissken?
COM OFFICER: Commander, I'm getting radio contact with the aircraft.
MALLOY: Boost it.
PRESIDENT: Thank God.
MALLOY: ( grabs a radio mike ) Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT ( into his radio ) Yeah, I got it.
PLISSKEN: ( into his radio ) Yeah, I got it.
PLISSKE: ( to Map To The Stars Eddie ) Now give me the real one.
UTOPIA: Now we're even, Snake.
COM OFFICER: Commander Malloy - he's got lots of Malloy and the others look at the computer screen. Plissken's green blip is followed by hundreds of other green blips all rapidly closing in on him.
MALLOY: Battle stations.
PLISSKEN: I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just Can you land?
HERSHE: Can you land?
PLISSKEN: No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off. ( beat as Plissken looks at Utopia ) Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
HERSHE: ( ice cold ) My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
SPINAL: Holy shit.
KAWHAM!: The line shoots out and a gleaming grappling hook slams into the side of Plissken's chopper, the prongs clawing in, holding. In the lead helicopter, the Black Cowboys, Spinal and Hershe aim their Don't shoot! They can drag us down into the sea.
PLISSKEN: Don't shoot! They can drag us down into the sea.
PLISSKEN: ( to Utopia ) Take the controls!
UTOPIA: What do I do?
AS BOOM!: Map To The Stars Eddie is hit with gunfire, dies, falls out of the seat, out of the door, out of the helicopter - plunges to the water below.
UTOPIA: Snake, look.
PRESIDENT: Where the hell is he going?
PLISSKEN: It's taking all the power we've got to CLOSE - ROTOR R.P.M. GAUGE Shows 100% plus power. The helicopter is in a trembling hover. Jump out. Head for the treeline and Utopia stares at him.
PLISSKEN: Jump out. Head for the treeline and Utopia stares at him.
PLISSKEN: Utopia jumps out of the helicopter. lands on the ground and takes off running into the darkness. Inside.
PLISSKEN: All right, baby. Don't be too rough on me. We're gonna land.
PLISSKEN: Where's the anti-toxin.?
PRESIDENT: Give me the prototype.
MALLOY: Hold it, Plissken. Now give us the real Plissken reaches down into his other boot, comes out with Map To The Stars Eddie's transistor radio. The President hurls the real prototype away, walks to Plissken and grabs the phony. Plissken glances at it lying on the ground.
PLISSKEN: Give me the goddamn shot!
MALLOY: It was all a fake, Plissken.
BRAZEN: You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
MALLOY: C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
MALLOY: Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
PRESIDENT: You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
MALLOY: You didn't finish the mission, Plissken. We'll have to do that for you.
PLISSKEN: Got a smoke?
MALLOY: You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
PLISSKEN: The name's Plissken.
DUTY SERGEANT: We're being attacked, Commander. The north EXT. WALL - DAWN All of L.A. has arrive at the wall in boats. Gangs lean ladders, use ropes and hooks - they scale the wall. Pendejo Bob leads the charge. Pipeline is right behind him.
