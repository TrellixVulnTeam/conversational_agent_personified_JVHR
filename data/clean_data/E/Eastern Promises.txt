ANNA: Mum? Are you OK?
HELEN: ( contrite ) Of course not. It's Christmas.
HELEN: It's the chicken. The smell of chicken roasting reminds me of him.
ANNA: You should have done beef, then.
HELEN: It wouldn't be Christmas without tears in the gravy, would it.
HELEN: ( whispering ) It's your own fault for giving him something to play with.
ANNA: ( irritated ) Well, I can't read Russian, can I?
CUT TO: 11 INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY 11
ANNA: I told you, Uncle Stepan, I found it in the handbag of a girl who died in my ward.
STEPAN: Do you always rob the bodies of the dead?

STEPAN: Did you know that your daughter robs the bodies of the dead?
ANNA: Stepan, is there an address?
STEPAN: You have an uncle who doesn't steal things from the dead. Not even their secrets.
HELEN: Oh, don't go all momentous on us, Lift your elbows.
STEPAN: You should put this in her coffin, Anna. Bury her secrets with her Body. Singular.
ANNA: Body. Singular.
KIRILL: So you pick up Ozim and his bitch of a wife and you bring them back
NIKOLAI: I'll think of an excuse. Your excuses are like fucking fairy
KIRILL: Who the fuck's that?
NIKOLAI: ( in Russian ) Maybe somebody sent your dad a hooker for Christmas.
KIRILL: ( grinning ) You're so. fucking unbelievably
SEMYON: We are closed.
ANNA: I know.
SEMYON: ( with a twinkle ) Then unless one of my daughters is keeping something from me, you have the wrong address.
ANNA: I'd like to speak to the Manager.
SEMYON: My dad was Russian.
ANNA: My dad was Russian.
SEMYON: And his name?
ANNA: So, you are Anna Ivanovna.
SEMYON: So, you are Anna Ivanovna.
SEMYON: We must hurry. I must stir. Stir, stir or the gravy dies in my hands. Today it is family. Here is my son, Kirill. Kirill! The berries are too low, too low. And Roman, more glasses for red! Come on!
SEMYON: Come, come, hurry, hurry. They will be here any moment. Ok, show me this card.
ANNA: God, that's amazing. My dad made gravy just like that.
SEMYON: So did you get a chance to talk to this girl before she died?
SEMYON: This is an agency that hires casual kitchen staff. Maybe you will have more luck there. But I think they will be closed until New Year.
KIRILL: Papa, Ozim is here.
SEMYON: Ten minutes!! Fish, fish, fish! Ten minutes! OK, Kirill, get him a drink and tell him I am coming.
ANNA: That's OK. I'll probably find out more when I get her diary Her diary?
SEMYON: Her diary?
ANNA: I found her diary in her bag.
SEMYON: Why did you not tell me you found a diary?
ANNA: I was going to ask my uncle..
SEMYON: ( apparently not And when you come I will make you some more gravy like your papa used to make and you can try the
ANNA: Anna heads for the door that leads back to the restaurant. Semyon goes back to stirring but as he stirs he calls out.
SEMYON: Oh Anna, you always work at the Trafalgar hospital?
ANNA: Yes, always.
KIRILL: Hey, you OK? You want a drink?
ANNA: No, thanks. I'm driving.
KIRILL: OK. Merry Christmas. Drive safely.
NIKOLAI: ( in Russian ) Nice bike.
ANNA: Nice bike.
NIKOLAI: Nice bike.
ANNA: Thank you.
NIKOLAI: A Ural. You don't see them anymore.
ANNA: It was my dad's.
NIKOLAI: How much do you want for it?
ANNA: ( irritated ) It has sentimental value.
NIKOLAI: `Sentimental value'. I've heard of that.
ANNA: Nor me. Chauffeurs don't get invited. You want to go for a drink instead?
NIKOLAI: Nor me. Chauffeurs don't get invited. You want to go for a drink instead?
ANNA: It's Christmas. Everything's
NIKOLAI: Sometimes if things are closed you just open them up, you know?
STEPAN: Anna, how come is it that your boyfriend isn't here to carve?
ANNA: I don't live with Oliver any more, Uncle Stepan. I'm living back here for a bit.
HELEN: ( softly ) For as long as you want.
STEPAN: I knew he would run away from you.
ANNA: He didn't run away. You make me sound like a burning building.
STEPAN: Black men always run away.
HELEN: Oh Stepan!
STEPAN: What? I am allowed to be honest?
HELEN: He was a doctor, Stepan.
ANNA: What the hell has that got to do with it?
STEPAN: It is not natural to mix race and race. That is why your baby died inside you.
HELEN: Stepan, shut up! Please Anna.
ANNA: It's Christmas. I'm thirty-one.
HELEN: Anna, you know what he's like.
ANNA: I don't give a damn about Stepan. Who has that poor baby got in the whole world?
HELEN: I knew this would happen.
ANNA: Good. Fine. So you know Anna, she isn't your responsibility.
HELEN: Anna, she isn't your responsibility.
ANNA: The baby is my responsibility until I hand her over to the mother. The mother is dead.
HELEN: Then it's up to the proper
ANNA: The proper authorities will all be skiing until after New Year.
HELEN: It's part of the grieving.
ANNA: What grieving?
HELEN: In the last year you've lost your father and you lost a baby.
ANNA: I'm not hungry.
NIGHT: In a private room in the Special Care Baby Unit, Anna approaches Tatiana's baby's plastic crib. The baby is tightly bundled up, sound asleep. Through the windows of the room, we see the darkened, quiet ward outside - another Anna stands over the baby, her face full of emotion. There we see pain, loss, shame, emptiness, isolation. Tears begin to roll from her eyes, and then she is sobbing soundlessly.
KIRILL: ( to child ) He's called Goofy. Goofy yeah. ( into phone ) So the coast is clear, yeah? What? I said `coast'.
OZIM: The driver stays down here.
KIRILL: You really think I do this kind of
OZIM: Hey, hey, hey Ekrem, sakim, durgun, I got tickets, Ozim. It's with Chelsea. They said there was no tickets but I got tickets for the Chelsea game.
EKREM: I got tickets, Ozim. It's with Chelsea. They said there was no tickets but I got tickets for the Chelsea game.
OZIM: OK, OK, OK. You go and watch a DVD, yeah?
KIRILL: He knows to say he hasn't seen us, right Ozim?
OZIM: He don't know anything. He's touched by the angels.
KIRILL: That's him.
OZIM: ( softly ) Hey, hey, show some respect for a dead man.
KIRILL: Respect? This is respect. OK, Nikolai, he's all yours. And show some respect. This Muslim is scared of ghosts. Have you got a hair dryer?
NIKOLAI: Have you got a hair dryer?
NIKOLAI: You'd better burn that.
KIRILL: Aren't you going to weight him down or something?
NIKOLAI: If you want to dump a body, this is the place. The currents keep it under the surface until past the barrier.
SEMYON: Ah. My dear! I wasn't expecting you so early.
ANNA: Is it OK?
ANNA: I copied the whole thing.
SEMYON: Where is the original?
ANNA: I'm going to keep it. Maybe give it to Tatiana's daughter someday.
SEMYON: I will need my spectacles and a clear head. Today I broke my rules and drank vodka. Tomorrow I will translate it.
ANNA: Not far. I can drop by and pick it up.
SEMYON: Then maybe I can drive you home.
ANNA: I'm fine. I'm on my motorbike.
SEMYON: So what will happen to the poor After Christmas, they'll do a missing persons report.
ANNA: After Christmas, they'll do a missing persons report.
SEMYON: Who will?
ANNA: The police.
MARIA: Hey, hey, Maria, go back to bed.
SEMYON: Hey, hey, Maria, go back to bed.
MARIA: I'm too sad. Next Christmas isn't for another hundreds and hundreds of days.
SEMYON: But you have had so many presents.
MARIA: You shouldn't smoke, Grandpa.
SEMYON: I know.
KIRILL: We're partners now, man, you know?
NIKOLAI: Yeah, yeah, I know.
NIKOLAI: We went to a Kurdish place. They don't even celebrate Christmas.
KIRILL: Hey, Papa, what did I do? This is Merry Christmas or what?
NIKOLAI: I think he's had enough.
SEMYON: Who. the fuck. are you to tell me enough?
NIKOLAI: We're partners.
SEMYON: I hired you as a driver.
NIKOLAI: Well, you got more than a driver.
SEMYON: I have no idea what business you're talking about. Now get out.
NIKOLAI: You've got water in it. Water? What makes you think that?
ANNA: Water? What makes you think that?
NIKOLAI: The postmen used these. In my village. When I was a boy. Russian copy of BMW flat twin.
ANNA: Just across the park.
NIKOLAI: I'm a driver. I even do limousines.
NIKOLAI: So you're a midwife. Jesus.
ANNA: You get used to it.
NIKOLAI: I didn't faint, but it was close.
ANNA: How many have you got?
NIKOLAI: Yeah, I know, I know, it's just. it makes me upset, you know? Thinking about it. This time of year. They're back in Yekaterinburg. In the forests. Near the mountains.
ANNA: Left here.
NIKOLAI: I'm. sort of freelance.
ANNA: You said he'd fire you.
NIKOLAI: I meet lots of girls called Tatiana.
ANNA: She was pregnant.
NIKOLAI: In that case, no, I never heard of
ANNA: She died last night on my shift.
NIKOLAI: I thought you did birth.
ANNA: Sometimes birth and death go She had needle punctures all over both arms. Dehydration, emaciation. Early presentation of syphilis. Probably a prostitute. At the age of fourteen.
NIKOLAI: ( quickly, without a You know what? I hate the rain. This time of year. You ever been to Russia at Christmas? Man, snow that covers your whole house.
ANNA: You think Semyon's son knew her?
NIKOLAI: Like I said, I'm a driver. I go left, I go right, I go straight ahead. That's it.
ANNA: Just here is great.
NIKOLAI: Christmas present.
OFFICER: We think he might be Russian Mafia.
YURI: He is actually a Chechen. He is also a member of the vory v zakone. The stars on the knees mean he would never kneel before anyone.
OFFICER: There was something else. It was. inside the body. Chest cavity.
HELEN: Helen enters looking anxious. We see Stepan hovering in the background.
ANNA: ( pause ) Stepan, what? I'm late for work.
HELEN: It was on the dresser.
ANNA: Mum, you can't go through my things.
HELEN: You wanted him to translate it.
ANNA: And he said he wouldn't do it so I've found somebody else.
STEPAN: No Anna! You don't go to someone else with this! You don't go to anyone! Nasilovanie, it means rape. Iglah, it means needle. Prostitutcia, perhaps you can guess.
HELEN: Anna, Stepan said this girl ended up in the hands of the vory v zakone. Do you know what that Just because I'm back in this room doesn't mean I'm twelve again.
ANNA: Just because I'm back in this room doesn't mean I'm twelve again.
HELEN: You never listened to me even then!
ANNA: Look, if I don't find a relative in the next few days they'll put Christine out for fostering. Once she's in the system, she'll never get out again.
HELEN: Who named her Christine?
ANNA: I had to call her something. It sounds like Christmas. She's very beautiful.
HELEN: If I can persuade Stepan to translate it, will you leave the rest to the police?
ANNA: Tell him I've heard bad words
HELEN: Your father used to say the vory are a contagious disease. There's no cure once they've touched you.
ANNA: Momma, this is London.
ALBANIAN: OK, boss is here. Boss, boss. You make him happy.
KIRILL: So he said to me, `who is this driver guy?' I laughed so hard.
NIKOLAI: And what did he say?
KIRILL: You know my dad. He didn't say nothing. But his eyes looked
ALBANIAN: Get out of the fucking way, you black gypsy baboon.
KIRILL: Get out of the fucking way, you black gypsy baboon.
KIRILL: OK, which one you going to fuck!?
NIKOLAI: ( laughing ) What's it to you?
KIRILL: Serious. Pick one.
NIKOLAI: I'm just enjoying myself, man.
KIRILL: You hear me? You're going to fuck one of these girls.
NIKOLAI: OK, OK, Jesus.
KIRILL: You're going to fuck one of these girls right now. That's an order.
NIKOLAI: What? What's the matter with you?
KIRILL: Come on Nikolai. Who are you going to fuck?
NIKOLAI: You've drunk enough Kirill.
KIRILL: Kirill hurls his whisky bottle against the wall. The girls all flinch.
NIKOLAI: Kirill smiles. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 44.
KIRILL: You did OK! You did OK.
NIKOLAI: Nikolai glares at Kirill.
GIRL: ( CONTINUED )
NIKOLAI: ( in Russian ) Where are you from?
GIRL: ( in Ukrainian ) Where? Which village? Which town?
NIKOLAI: ( in Ukrainian ) Where? Which village? Which town?
GIRL: ( in Ukrainian ) Irpen. Outside Kiev.
NIKOLAI: ( in Ukrainian ) Stay alive a little longer.
NIGHT: In the half-lit private room, Anna is dancing with Christine in her arms. She is singing a lullaby softly to her. The door is open to the rest of the ward and all the other babies are silent. Finally she lays a sleeping Christine back in her crib. She sits down on the bed where the mother should be. She curses herself silently and gets to her feet, determined to pull herself together. As she starts to leave the private room to enter the ward, she is suddenly confronted by Semyon. He is standing in the shadows, a Bavarian trilby in his hands. Anna gasps with shock. Semyon speaks softly.
SEMYON: Hello Anna. I came on tiptoes.
ANNA: How did you get in here?
SEMYON: There are always open doors, Anna
ANNA: You're not allowed in here.
SEMYON: Please Anna, let me speak.
ANNA: What does it say about him?
SEMYON: Many bad things.
ANNA: I don't care about him. I care about the baby.
SEMYON: Of course. Of course. And that is the baby?
NURSE: It's OK. He's just leaving.
ANNA: It's OK. He's just leaving.
SEMYON: You know where I am, Anna Ivanovna.
STEPAN: .like potato sacks. Kirill came down after me and he hit me until I was bleeding. Then he tried to rape me but he couldn't do it. He just got madder and madder and kept hitting me. In the end his father came down. It was the father who raped me. He shouted at his son.'if you don't break a horse, it will never be tame, Kirill'.
HELEN: Hello dear. How was your night?
ANNA: Anna gently pushes Helen back into her seat.
HELEN: What's wrong?
ANNA: He came to see me. The man from the restaurant. He came to the hospital.
STEPAN: I told you this would happen! I told you!
HELEN: Sit down Stepan.
STEPAN: The devil is loose now.
ANNA: I know it's my fault.
HELEN: It's no one's fault.
STEPAN: They are in this room now. They are cancer.
HELEN: We should just sit down calmly and I have a friend from Ukraine who owns a gun..
STEPAN: I have a friend from Ukraine who owns a gun..
HELEN: .from the war in Afghanistan.
STEPAN: .from the war in Afghanistan.
HELEN: Don't talk about guns.
ANNA: Shut up both of you!!!
STEPAN: We all know what he would have
HELEN: And then he would have been He would ask if there were bullets for the gun.
STEPAN: He would ask if there were bullets for the gun.
HELEN: No! This isn't our world. We're just. ordinary people.
STEPAN: I dealt with the vory v zakone when I worked for the KGB.
ANNA: You never worked for the fucking
KGB!: ( primly ) I was an auxiliary!
HELEN: ( primly ) I was an auxiliary!
STEPAN: ( primly ) I was an auxiliary!
HELEN: A stand off. Finally.
ANNA: The diary. In return he'll give us an address for Tatiana's family. For Christine's family.
HELEN: And that's all he wants?
STEPAN: You cannot do deals with these This isn't a deal. It's an exchange of information.
HELEN: This isn't a deal. It's an exchange of information.
STEPAN: Have you forgotten already what I just read to you?
HELEN: We must be practical.
ANNA: Stepan, I think he was threatening to harm Christine.
HELEN: Then it's settled.
STEPAN: No!! No!! No!!
HELEN: ( repeating as a Stepan, this isn't our world. We are ordinary people.
STEPAN: She was an ordinary person.
KIRILL: Hey, come on, Nikolai, I've got a Christmas present for you.
KIRILL: Open one.
NIKOLAI: From where?
KIRILL: `From where?' From where you don't ask. Give it here.
NIKOLAI: Import-export sounds good.
KIRILL: You bet it's fucking good. Jesus Christ, Papa. You scared
SEMYON: Your friend Soyka is dead.
KIRILL: Yeah? So what? What's that got to do with me?
SEMYON: Don't lie to me!!
KIRILL: I swear I don't know nothing about I said, don't lie to me!
SEMYON: I said, don't lie to me!
NIKOLAI: Your dad is right, Kirill. There's no point lying to him.
KIRILL: ( in Russian ) Shut your fucking mouth!
NIKOLAI: ( in Russian ) Your dad always knows the truth
SEMYON: ( incredulous ) I don't have to worry?
NIKOLAI: I disposed of the body myself. The police won't find a thing.
SEMYON: My son commits a murder?
NIKOLAI: The vory code says you don't talk to anybody about your captain. Kirill is my captain.
SEMYON: I decide what is right and what is wrong. You do not kill a vor for no reason.
NIKOLAI: You know as well as I do Soyka was talking to the police.
SEMYON: For a driver, you are well informed.
NIKOLAI: I've got connections with the Chechens who export cars. Soyka was speaking to the Russian desk. Scotland Yard.
KIRILL: Papa, I swear to you, I was going Shut up!
SEMYON: Shut up!
NIKOLAI: ( with a smile ) That's OK. Kirill has got me.
SEMYON: Get these boxes out of sight.
KIRILL: You heard him, patsan! Get these boxes out of sight.
ANNA: How the hell can you eat?
STEPAN: I'm hungry.
ANNA: That's their driver. Tell me you haven't done anything
HELEN: ( hissing ) Tell me you haven't done anything
NIKOLAI: Meet in a public place with lots of people around. Very wise.
STEPAN: ( whispers, in Russian ) When I was in the KGB, we knew how to deal with scum like you.
NIKOLAI: ( in Russian ) When you were in what?
HELEN: Shush, Stepan. Anna?
ANNA: ( shaking ) Now you give me the address.
NIKOLAI: What address?
ANNA: Tatiana's family.
NIKOLAI: I don't know what you're talking
STEPAN: I told you! I knew they would do
HELEN: Anna! No! Come back here!
ANNA: She was fourteen! Read the diary! She was fourteen when he raped
NIKOLAI: Anger is very dangerous. It makes people do stupid things. Forget any of this ever happened. You're in the wrong place, Anna Ivanovna.
SEMYON: It is good to have someone who I can trust to do simple tasks.
NIKOLAI: After a moment.
SEMYON: So what was the lie that Soyka was spreading about my son?
NIKOLAI: ( in Russian ) It was nothing important.
SEMYON: Kirill had him killed for nothing
NIKOLAI: I don't want to repeat it.
SEMYON: ( smiling ) For me you will repeat it.
NIKOLAI: That he is a drunk. And that he is also. a queer.
SEMYON: ( softly, in Russian ) My only son.
NIKOLAI: So why don't you go home?
SEMYON: The cold gets into my bones.
NIKOLAI: FSB. They are called FSB now.
SEMYON: Whatever they call them they are worse even than the KGB were. Maybe the KGB and the vory v zakone were partners in a marriage. We had rules, they had rules.
NIKOLAI: I met him.
SEMYON: So you know what he looks like.
NIKOLAI: I thought I'd bring it back before it got stolen. Lot of villains around. Sorry about the chain.
ANNA: You read the diary?
NIKOLAI: I told you. I'm just a driver. You look the other way.
ANNA: You look the other way.
NIKOLAI: I'm a camera. The pictures stay in my head.
ANNA: Why did you bring me this?
NIKOLAI: I don't know. I was passing.
ANNA: I don't know.
NIKOLAI: Well, he's a brave old man. That's for sure.
EKREM: Hey! Hey Kabuka Chelsea! Fuck you!! Yeah you! Aliverisme!!
CHECHEN: For my brother.
DISHWASHER: ( in Russian ) Guy out the back.
SEMYON: So what did they say?
OZIM: They were going to kill me. Those Chechens are savages.
SEMYON: ( irritated ) What did they say about my son?
OZIM: They said they would spare me only if I delivered Kirill to them.
SEMYON: You are being very honest.
OZIM: I fear you more than I fear them.
SEMYON: Never again do business with any member of my family behind my back.
OZIM: Never. I will never listen to Kirill again. I swear.
SEMYON: Do they know where to find Kirill?
OZIM: They are like wolves.
SEMYON: Do they know what he looks like?
OZIM: No. They have just arrived from the mountains.
SEMYON: Then tell them you will deliver Kirill to them.
ANNA: Mum. I can't get hold of Stepan.
HELEN: Why do you want to?
ANNA: I need to check something with He's not at home, do you know where else he might be?
HELEN: ( matter of fact ) He's not at home, do you know where else he might be?
ANNA: ( matter of fact ) He's not at home, do you know where else he might be?
HELEN: Anna. Haven't you had enough I think I've worked out who Christine's father is.
ANNA: ( deadpan ) I think I've worked out who Christine's father is.
HELEN: ( yelling ) Why does it matter?!!
ANNA: ( firmly ) It matters. to me!! You enjoy this.
HELEN: You enjoy this.
NIKOLAI: What are you doing here?
ANNA: ( echoing Nikolai's I don't know. I was passing.
KIRILL: If you're passing, you pass. You keep going, bitch. Nikolai, come Family is important to you people isn't it?
ANNA: Family is important to you people isn't it?
KIRILL: ( laughing ) 'You people'? ( in Russian ) What the hell is she talking about?
ANNA: Tell Semyon the baby I delivered on Christmas Eve is his daughter.
KIRILL: ( in Russian ) What did she say?!
ANNA: When he raped her she was a virgin. Then they gave her pills. Semyon has to be the father!
NIKOLAI: ( in Russian ) ) She's a civilian!
ANNA: She was fourteen! She was a child!
KIRILL: You don't use my father's name! You don't say that filth about Don't even look at her any more.
ANNA: Tell him what I said. There is nothing to tell. Slaves give birth to slaves.
NIKOLAI: There is nothing to tell. Slaves give birth to slaves.
KIRILL: Come on Nikolai!!
KIRILL: That girl you fucked in front of me. you remember her? The Ukrainian bitch?
NIKOLAI: So they kick down the door. These are ordinary fucking police. They ask for her by name and they take her away. Some fucking punter must have given them her name. What gives the police the right to take our women, huh?
KIRILL: So they kick down the door. These are ordinary fucking police. They ask for her by name and they take her away. Some fucking punter must have given them her name. What gives the police the right to take our women, huh?
SEMYON: ( in Russian ) She is one hundred years old.
KIRILL: Come on, Nikolai, help me.
SEMYON: No. He stays here. I want to talk business.
KIRILL: What business?
SEMYON: Go to the cellar Kirill. And take your time.
NIKOLAI: ( in Russian ) Thank you. Papa.
SEMYON: Tell him I changed my mind about the brandy.
KIRILL: My dad swapped a little Georgian girl for this stuff.
NIKOLAI: He offered me stars. I accepted
KIRILL: ( lying ) ) You think I didn't know already? He told me before. It was my fucking idea. He said there are a lot of things I have to teach you.
NIKOLAI: A pause.
KIRILL: A pause.
NIKOLAI: I know, Kirill. Where the fuck are you going? We've got to celebrate. Help me with these bottles.
KIRILL: Where the fuck are you going? We've got to celebrate. Help me with these bottles.
NIKOLAI: Your dad don't need the bottles any more.
KIRILL: Hey! We're still partners, right? Thunder and lightning!
VALERY: We can see that you were in prison in Siberia. And that you were a My father was a government worker. He fixed the cars of officials. I began by selling the spare parts when I was fifteen.
NIKOLAI: My father was a government worker. He fixed the cars of officials. I began by selling the spare parts when I was fifteen.
VALERY: You have no forced tattoos?
NIKOLAI: You were not co-operative?
GYPSY: You were not co-operative?
NIKOLAI: I spent two years in the punishment You went through the Crosses in St. Petersburg?
VALERY: You went through the Crosses in St. Petersburg?
NIKOLAI: I was in solitary confinement fifteen times. I was called 'The Stump' because they couldn't shift Your father was a bitch and a weak fucker for working with the Government, that's right isn't it?
VALERY: Your father was a bitch and a weak fucker for working with the Government, that's right isn't it?
NIKOLAI: That's right. My father means nothing to me. My Mother..
GYPSY: You have no mother. She was a whore anyway.
NIKOLAI: Yes. I have no mother and no father. There is only the code, the vory v zakone code which I have always followed.
VALERY: That is why there is an empty place above your heart. Where the stars will go. And why there is an empty place on your knees.

GYPSY: You have never worked for the government? Any government?
NIKOLAI: I have lived off Albanians and Georgians. I steal from them within the law.
HELEN: ( almost accusing ) Have you slept at all?
ANNA: I don't think the driver would do anything to Stepan.
HELEN: How do you know what he would do?
OZIM: Semyon recommends these places for business meetings because you can see what tattoos a man has. Come on. We have a lot to get through. Let's cook.

Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open. All the men are now covered in blood and Nikolai, with a final surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the As the Chechens slump to the floor, Nikolai fumbles in the bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes their throats. He lurches to his feet, drops the razor, and staggers out of the steam room.
