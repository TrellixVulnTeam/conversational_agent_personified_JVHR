CARL: Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it. If only someone could help me.
RUSSELL: Me! Me! I'll do it!

CARL: Morning gentlemen.
NURSE GEORGE: Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen. You ready to go?
CARL: Ready as I'll ever be. Would you do me a favor and take this?
CARL: I'll meet you at the van in just a minute. I. want to say one last goodbye to the old place.
NURSE GEORGE: Sure. Take all the time you need, sir.
NURSE GEORGE: You'd think he'd take better care of his house.
CARL: So long boys! I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls!
CARL: We're on our way, Ellie.
CARL: He stares at the front door. Nothing.
CARL: KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. He bolts up and approaches the door. He looks out the peep hole. Nothing but the porch and clouds. He throws it open.
RUSSELL: Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It's me, What are you doing out here, kid?
CARL: What are you doing out here, kid?
RUSSELL: I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse.
RUSSELL: Please let me in?
CARL: Carl slams the door, leaving Russell alone. Beat. The door opens again.
CARL: Oh, alright, you can come.
CARL: INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Russell PANTS, panicked. He looks into living room.

RUSSELL: Wow! This is great! You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away! Hey, I can see your house from here!
CARL: ( struggling to hold on ) Don't jerk around so much, kid!
CARL: Well, that's not gonna work.
RUSSELL: I know that cloud, it's a Cumulo Nimbus. Did you know that the Cumulo Nimbus.
CARL: Stayed up all night blowing up balloons, for what?
RUSSELL: .warm air goes by cool air, and the airs go by each other and that's how we get lightning.
CARL: That's nice, kid.
RUSSELL: ( nearly silent ) Mr. Fredricksen, there's a big storm coming. It's starting to get scary. We're gonna get blown to bits! We're in big trouble, Mr.

RUSSELL: My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet. With this baby, we'll never be lost!
RUSSELL: INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl kneels by the fireplace and cuts at the balloon strings.
CARL: We'll get you down, find a bus stop. You just tell the man you want to go back to your mother.
RUSSELL: Sure, but I don't think they have busses in Paradise Falls.
CARL: There. That ought to do it. Here, I'll give you some change for bus fare.
RUSSELL: Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass.
RUSSELL: Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?
CARL: Well, we're up pretty high. Could take hours to get down.
CARL: ( MUMBLING ) .that thing was.building or

RUSSELL: They slide toward the edge. and stop. The drop is thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED.
CARL: Walk back! Walk back!
RUSSELL: Russell PULLS Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge. Carl, still hanging from the hose, looks around. Fog blankets the mysterious landscape, revealing only scattered rocks.
CARL: ( out of breath ) Where. where are we?
RUSSELL: This doesn't look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.

CARL: What are you talking about?
RUSSELL: We could walk your house to the Walk it?
CARL: Walk it?
RUSSELL: Yeah, after all, we weigh it down. We could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon.
CARL: Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash-dancing.
RUSSELL: ( DISTRACTED ) We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we're not at the falls when that happens.
CARL: We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we're not at the falls when that happens.
RUSSELL: .we're not getting to the falls!

RUSSELL: I found sand!
CARL: Don't you worry, Ellie. We'll get our house over there.

RUSSELL: Well, I didn't have to go then!
RUSSELL: I don't want to walk anymore. Can we stop?
CARL: Russell! If you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you.

CARL: ( RECITING ) "An Explorer is a friend to all, be it plants or fish or tiny mole."
RUSSELL: ( RECITING ) "An Explorer is a friend to all, be it plants or fish or tiny mole."
CARL: That doesn't even rhyme.
RUSSELL: Yeah it does.

RUSSELL: You were talking to a rock.
RUSSELL: Hey, that one looks like a turtle!
RUSSELL: Look at that one! That one looks like a dog!
RUSSELL: It is a dog!
CARL: Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment.
RUSSELL: Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment.
RUSSELL: Hey, I like dogs!
CARL: ( calls out ) We have your dog! ( to self ) Wonder who he belongs to?
RUSSELL: Sit boy.
RUSSELL: Hey look, he's trained! Shake!
RUSSELL: Uh-huh. Speak.
DUG: Hi there.
CARL: Did that dog just say "Hi there?"
DUG: Oh yes.
DUG: My name is Dug. I have just met you and I love you.
CARL: Dug wears a high-tech collar. The dog's thoughts come out of it as words through a speaker. It can talk. Unfortunately, it talks non-stop.
DUG: My master made me this collar. He is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk SQUIRREL!!
DUG: My master is good and smart.
CARL: It's not possible.
DUG: Oh it is, because my master is
RUSSELL: Cool! What do these do, boy?
DUG: Hey would you-
CARL: Russell, don't touch that. It could be radioactive or something.
DUG: I am a great tracker. My pack sent me on a special mission all by myself. Have you seen a bird? I want to find one and I have been on the scent. I am a great tracker, did I mention that?
DUG: Hey, that is the bird! I have never seen one up close but this is the bird. May I take your bird back to camp as my prisoner?
CARL: Yes! Take it! And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog!
DUG: Oh I can bark!
DUG: And here's howling!
RUSSELL: Can we keep him? Please please
CARL: Russell falls to his knees, pleading.
RUSSELL: But it's a talking dog!
CARL: It's just a weird trick or something. Let's get to the falls.
DUG: Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh please be my prisoner.
GAMMA: Oh, here it is. I picked up the bird's scent!
BETA: Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is this? Chocolate. I smell I'm getting prunes and denture cream! Who are they?
GAMMA: I'm getting prunes and denture cream! Who are they?
BETA: Ah man, Master will not be pleased. We'd better tell him someone took the bird, right Alpha?
ALPHA: ( high-pitched voice ) No. Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again.
BETA: Hey Alpha, I think there's something wrong with your collar. You must have bumped it.
GAMMA: Yeah, your voice sounds funny!
ALPHA: Beta. Gamma. Mayhaps you desire to SQUIRREL!
BETA: No no. But maybe Dug would. You might want to ask him.
GAMMA: Yeah, I wonder if he's found the bird on his very special mission.
ALPHA: Do not mention Dug to me at this time. His fool's errand will keep him most occupied, most occupied indeed. Ha ha ha. Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now?
BETA: Sure, but the second Master finds out you sent Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat.
ALPHA: You are wise, my trusted
DUG: Hi Alpha. Hey, your voice sounds I know, I know! Have you seen the Why yes, the bird is my prisoner Yeah, right.
ALPHA: I know, I know! Have you seen the Why yes, the bird is my prisoner Yeah, right.
DUG: Why yes, the bird is my prisoner Yeah, right.
GAMMA: Yeah, right.
ALPHA: Impossible! Where are you?!
DUG: I am here with the bird and I will bring it back and then you will like me. Oh, gotta go.
RUSSELL: ( on video screen ) Hey Dug! Who you talking to?
BETA: What's Dug doing?
GAMMA: Why's he with that small mailman?
BETA: Where are they?
ALPHA: There he is. Come on!
DUG: Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my Dug, stop bothering Kevin!
RUSSELL: Dug, stop bothering Kevin!
DUG: That man there says I can take the bird and I love that man there like he is my master.
CARL: I am not your master!
DUG: I am warning you, once again, bird!
RUSSELL: Hey! Quit it!
DUG: I am jumping on you now, bird.
CARL: Russell! At this rate we'll never get to the falls!
CARL: I am nobody's master, got it? I don't want you here, .and I don't want you here. I'm stuck with you. And if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three-
DUG: A ball! Oh boy oh boy! A ball!
CARL: Carl pops off one of the tennis balls.
CARL: You want it boy? Huh? Huh? Yeah?
DUG: Oh oh oh! Yes, I do. I do ever so want the ball!
CARL: Go get it!!
DUG: Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and then bring it back!
CARL: ( WHISPERS ) Quick Russell, give me some chocolate.
RUSSELL: Just give it to me!
CARL: Just give it to me!
CARL: Bird. Bird!

CARL: EXT. MOUNTAIN JUNGLE
RUSSELL: What are we doing?
RUSSELL: Hey, uh, we're pretty far now. Kevin's gonna miss me.
CARL: I think that did the trick.
DUG: Hi, Master.
CARL: Carl turns the other way. The bird. It HONKS at him.
CARL: Well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway, Ellie.
RUSSELL: Is this step three, or step five?
RUSSELL: Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into Carl can't watch. An off screen SMACK! Russell walks to Carl. Miraculously, he looks unscathed.
RUSSELL: All done.
RUSSELL: ( pointing to tent ) That's for you!
RUSSELL: Awh. Tents are hard.
CARL: Wait, aren't you "Super Wilderness Guy?" With the GPM's and the badges?
RUSSELL: Yeah, but. can I tell you a Alright, here goes. I never actually built a tent before. There. I said it.
CARL: Alright, here goes. I never actually built a tent before. There. I said it.
RUSSELL: Alright, here goes. I never actually built a tent before. There. I said it.
CARL: You've been camping before, haven't Well, never outside.
RUSSELL: Well, never outside.
CARL: Well, why didn't you ask your Dad how to build a tent?
RUSSELL: I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff.
CARL: Why don't you try him sometime? Maybe he'll surprise you.
RUSSELL: Well, he's away a lot. I don't see him much.
CARL: He's got to be home sometime.
RUSSELL: Well, I called, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much.
CARL: Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name?
RUSSELL: Phyllis isn't my mom.
CARL: The two sit silently together, watching the fire.
RUSSELL: But he promised he'd come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge, so he can show me about tents then,
CARL: Hey, uh, why don't you get some sleep. Don't want to wake up the traveling flea circus.
RUSSELL: Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner. We have to protect him!
RUSSELL: Can Kevin go with us?
CARL: Alright. He can come.
RUSSELL: Promise you won't leave him?
CARL: Cross your heart?
RUSSELL: Cross your heart?
CARL: Cross my heart.
CARL: What have I got myself into, Ellie?
CARL: Morning Sweetheart.
CARL: We better get moving.
CARL: Huh. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell won't notice. Alright, everybody up!
RUSSELL: Where's Kevin? He's wandered off! Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!
DUG: Find the bird. Find the bird.
POINT!: Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and "points" to the left.
RUSSELL: Oh, look! There he is.
DUG: The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl's roof.
POINT!: The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl's roof.
CARL: Hey, that's my food! Get off my Yeah, get off of his !
DUG: Yeah, get off of his !
CARL: What is it doing?
DUG: The bird is calling to her babies.
RUSSELL: Her babies! Kevin's a girl?
DUG: Her house is over there in those twisty rocks.
DUG: She has been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them.
RUSSELL: Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But you promised to protect her!
RUSSELL: Her babies need her, we gotta make sure they're together.
CARL: Sorry Russell. We've lost enough time already.
RUSSELL: EXT. MOUNTAIN, EDGE OF JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER The bird rounds a corner and hears rustling in the bushes ahead. She scampers back toward the house.
RUSSELL: This was her favorite chocolate. Because you sent her away, there's more for you.
CARL: Beta and Gamma, run toward Carl and Russell, viciously barking and growling. Carl protects Russell with his cane.
RUSSELL: Beta and Gamma, run toward Carl and Russell, viciously barking and growling. Carl protects Russell with his cane.
ALPHA: ( high-pitched voice ) Where's the bird? You said you had the bird.
DUG: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have said that, I can see how you would think that.
ALPHA: Where is it?

CARL: Wait, we're not going with you. We're going to the falls!
CARL: Get away from me! Get down!
VOICE: You came here in that?
CARL: Uh. yeah.
VOICE: In a house? A floating house?
VOICE: That is the darndest thing I've ever seen! You're not after my bird, are you? But if you need to borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige!
VOICE: Well, this is all a misunderstanding. My dogs made a mistake.
CARL: Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!
MUNTZ: Well. Yes.
CARL: The Charles Muntz?
MUNTZ: "Adventure is out there!"
CARL: It's really him! That's Charles Muntz!
RUSSELL: ( EXCITED ) It is?!?

MUNTZ: ( to dogs ) Attention everyone! These people are no longer intruders. They are our guests.

CARL: Carl's eyes adjust to the dark. Muntz's dirigible the "Spirit of Adventure" is tethered in the cave.
MUNTZ: Go ahead and moor your airship right next to mine.
CARL: We're not actually going inside the "Spirit of Adventure" itself?!
MUNTZ: Oh. Would you like to?
CARL: Would I?!?!
CARL: Wait up, Mr. Muntz!
CARL: Jiminy Cricket.
BETA: Not you.
GAMMA: What do we do with Dug?
ALPHA: He has lost the bird. Put him in the Cone of Shame.
DUG: I do not like the Cone of Shame.
MUNTZ: Most of the collection is housed in the world's top museums: New York, Munich, London. `Course I kept the best for myself.
CARL: Did you ever! Will you look at that?
MUNTZ: Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast charged while I was brushing my teeth. Used my shaving kit to bring him down.
MUNTZ: Oh, surprise me. Only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared as "dental equipment!"
CARL: Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian Leopard Tortoise!
MUNTZ: Oh, you recognize it? I'm impressed! That's an interesting story there.
MUNTZ: Hm, excellent choice. I found it on safari with

MUNTZ: Well, dinner is served! Right this
MUNTZ: So how are things stateside? Almost tempted to go back a few times, but I have unfinished work here. Please.
MUNTZ: I hope you're hungry because Epsilon is the finest chef I've ever had. Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!
MUNTZ: Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!
RUSSELL: Russell is served a hot dog. His waiter can't resist and eats a bite.
RUSSELL: Another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his Carl looks around, still enthralled.
RUSSELL: Carl looks around, still enthralled.
CARL: Oh my Ellie would have loved all this. You know, it's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by Paradise Falls.
MUNTZ: I'm honored. And now you've made You're sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose.
CARL: You're sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose.
MUNTZ: No no! It's a pleasure to have guests a real treat.
DOG WALLA: Treat?! Treat! I want a treat!
MUNTZ: No no, quiet! Calm down. Calm
RUSSELL: ( CONT'D ) Shouldn't've used that word. Having guests is a delight. More often I get thieves, come to steal what's rightfully mine.
MUNTZ: ( CONT'D ) Shouldn't've used that word. Having guests is a delight. More often I get thieves, come to steal what's rightfully mine.
CARL: Muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room.
MUNTZ: They called me a fraud, those. dah! But once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared.
MUNTZ: Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a lifetime tracking it. Sometimes years go by between sightings.
MUNTZ: And here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take! But they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous
RUSSELL: Hey, that looks like Kevin!
MUNTZ: Yeah! That's my new giant bird pet. I trained it to follow us.
RUSSELL: Yeah! That's my new giant bird pet. I trained it to follow us.
MUNTZ: Follow you? Impossible. How?
RUSSELL: She likes chocolate.
MUNTZ: Yeah, I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it.
RUSSELL: Yeah, I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it.
CARL: But it ran off! It's gone now.
MUNTZ: You know, Carl. These people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories. A "Surveyor" making a map.
MUNTZ: A "Botanist" cataloguing plants.
MUNTZ: An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls.
MUNTZ: That's the best one yet. I can't wait to hear how it ends.
BIRD!: Well! It's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going.
CARL: Well! It's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going.
MUNTZ: Oh, you're not leaving?
CARL: We don't want to take advantage of your hospitality. Come on Russell.
RUSSELL: But we haven't even had dessert
MUNTZ: No, the boy's right. You haven't had dessert. Epsilon here makes a delicious Cherries Jubilee.
MUNTZ: Oh, you really must stay. I insist! We have so much more to talk about!
RUSSELL: Muntz walks to the window and looks out. Atop the roof he sees THE BIRD.
MUNTZ: It's here.
MUNTZ: ( to dogs ) Get them!
CARL: I am hurrying!
RUSSELL: I am hurrying!
RUSSELL: They're coming!
DUG: Go toward the light, master!
CARL: Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly.
CARL: Get back!!
DUG: Go on Master! I will stop the
DUG: Stop you dogs!!
RUSSELL: Help! Help!
CARL: Gimme your hand!
RUSSELL: Hang on to Kevin!
RUSSELL: No no no! Kevin! Stay down. She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home?
CARL: Alright. But we've got to hurry.
MUNTZ: You lost them?
BETA: Uh, it was Dug.
GAMMA: Yeah, he's with them. He helped them escape!
MUNTZ: Wait. Wait a minute. Dug.
CARL: See anything?
DUG: No, my pack is not following us! Boy they are dumb.
CARL: This is crazy. I finally meet my childhood hero and he's trying to kill us! What a joke.
DUG: Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel walks up to a tree and says I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny because the squirrel gets dead.
CARL: Careful Russell. You okay, Kevin?
RUSSELL: You okay, Kevin?
RUSSELL: You know what, Mr. Fredricksen? The wilderness isn't quite what I Yeah? How so?
CARL: Yeah? How so?
RUSSELL: It's kinda. wild. I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my Hmm, get used to that, kid.
CARL: Hmm, get used to that, kid.
RUSSELL: My dad made it sound so easy. He's really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff. He used to come to all my Sweatlodge
RUSSELL: And afterwards we'd go get ice cream at Fentons. I always get chocolate and he gets butter- brickle. Then we'd sit on this one curb, right outside, and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most, wins. I like that curb.
RUSSELL: That might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most.
RUSSELL: Look, there it is!
CARL: Hold on Russell, stand still!
CARL: Look at that bird go!
CARL: Wait up, you overgrown chicken!
RUSSELL: That's it, go Kevin! Go find your
RUSSELL: Run Kevin! Run!
RUSSELL: Oh no!
CARL: Russell, give me your knife!
CARL: Carl panics. He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife.
RUSSELL: Carl pulls his house away from the flames.
MUNTZ: Careful. We want her in good shape for my return.
RUSSELL: Let her go! Stop!
RUSSELL: Carl beats out the flames with his jacket. He extinguishes the flames.
RUSSELL: You gave away Kevin. You just gave her away.
CARL: This is none of my concern. I didn't ask for any of this!
DUG: Master. It's alright.
CARL: I am not your master! And if you hadn't a shown up, none of this would have happened! Bad dog! Bad
CARL: Now, whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me.
RUSSELL: I don't want this anymore.
LOVE, ELLIE.": Carl smiles.
CARL: But Russell is nowhere to be seen.
CARL: I'm gonna help Kevin even if you
RUSSELL: I'm gonna help Kevin even if you
CARL: No, Russell! No!
CARL: The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of things. Beside it sits Carl and Ellie's chairs, side by side atop Paradise Falls.
CARL: INT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS The door swings open.

MUNTZ: Well, if you're here, Fredricksen can't be far behind.
RUSSELL: Where are you keeping Kevin!?
RUSSELL: Let me go!
BETA: Scream all you want, small mailman.
GAMMA: None of your mailman friends can hear you.
RUSSELL: I'll unleash all my Wilderness Explorer training!
MUNTZ: Alpha! Fredricksen's coming back. Guard that bird. If you see the old man, you know what to do.
RUSSELL: Hey, where are you going? I'm not finished with you!
MUNTZ: Nice talking with you.
MUNTZ: Where are you, Fredricksen?
CARL: Carl steers his house to the dirigible.
RUSSELL: Mr. Fredricksen!
CARL: Dug! Bring `er over!

CARL: Don't worry Kevin, we're on our

DOGS: I'm gonna get there first! Oh gonna get the ball! I'm gonna get it!
GAMMA: I got it!!
GAMMA: INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM Carl opens the cage door.

MUNTZ: What? Calm down! One at a time!
RUSSELL: I want to help!
RUSSELL: Ha ha!
DOG WALLA: He's in Hall D! He's in Hall B! It's the old man!
MUNTZ: Does anyone know where they are?!?!

MUNTZ: ( into radio ) Grey leader! Take down the house!
BETA: ( into radio ) Grey leader, checking in.
GAMMA: Grey 2, checking in.
OMEGA: Grey 3, checking in.
BETA: Target sighted.
CARL: Come on, Kevin.
DUG: INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY Dug runs. The dogs give chase.
MUNTZ: Any last words, Fredricksen? Come on, spit it out!
CARL: Come on!
MUNTZ: Enough! I'm taking that bird back with me alive or dead!
CARL: Come on, Kevin!
ALPHA: I will have many enjoyments for what I am about to do, Dug.
MISC DOG: He wears the Cone of Shame!
ALPHA: ( high-pitched voice ) What? Do not just continue sitting! Attack!
ALPHA: ( high pitched voice ) No! No! Stop your laughing! Get this off of me!
DUG: Listen you dog! Sit!
DOG WALLA: Yes, Alpha.
DUG: Alpha? I am not Alpha, he is-
RUSSELL: ( out of breath ) I can't do it!

CARL: Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face.
DUG: The house bears down on them. They run to meet it.
CARL: Russell!! Over here!! Let's go!
RUSSELL: Mr. Fredricksen!
CARL: Come on, Kevin!
CARL: Carl SCRAMBLES to grab the hose trailing from the sliding house. The house slides on to the dirigible's tail fin. Holding the hose, Carl digs in his heels and is just able to stop it.
CARL: Russell! Get out of there!
CARL: No! Leave them alone!
CARL: Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don't let go of her!
CARL: Kevin! Chocolate!
RUSSELL: That was cool!
CARL: Don't jerk around so much, kid!
DUG: Oh I am ready to not be up high.
RUSSELL: Sorry about your house, Mr.
CARL: You know, it's just a house.
CARL: Ow! Ow! Ow!
RUSSELL: Look at you. You're so soft.
RUSSELL: I wish I could keep one.
CARL: Huh, where's my cane? I just had it here.
CARL: You know what? Keep `em. A little gift from me to you.
RUSSELL: Bye Kevin!
RUSSELL: Carl gives a thumbs up.
CARL: EXT. DIRIGIBLE Muntz's dirigible ascends into the sky. Dug and all of MUNTZ'S DOGS stick their heads out the dirigible windows, barking as they fly into the sunset.
