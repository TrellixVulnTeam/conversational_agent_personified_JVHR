PEDRO: You will give my autographed baseball to Tippy and tell him in five years I will be pitching with him, okay? He better watch out for me, eh?
SANDINISTA #1: ( in Spanish ) It's too dangerous to return to Managua at night. You should stay at the house of hammocks.

SOMOZA: Nonsense let them wait. We are a stunning couple, eh? My stomach is very flat I've been working out.

HUB: Listen, Russell, let's grow up. It's very easy to fall in love with the underdog, eh? But there's an upside and downside to this thing just wanta remind you. this stuff about a "Revolution of Poets" is crap.

CLAIRE: Since the earthquake in 1972 destroyed half of Managua, over three hundred million dollars in foreign relief aid have poured into the country, yet nothing has been re-built. It is said that the money has gone into your pocket.
SOMOZA: I love the press, I really do. Some of my best friends are journalists.

JAZY: I don't know.
PRICE: ( to the posers ) Just one more thank you. ( to Jazy ) I thought you knew everything?
JAZY: What do I know, eh? Tacho needs a victory very badly. he needs to prove to Jimmy Carter that he is still winning. He thinks Rafael's death is the proof he needs.
PRICE: Carter don't need proof. He just sent twenty-five million in new arms to Tacho. I'm sorry. almost got it here.
JAZY: No, no. the arms shipment has been delayed in New Orleans because Jimmy is getting nervous.
PRICE: The State Department's gonna pull the plug on Tacho?! Pardon my French but whose fucking side are you on?
JAZY: .I work for everybody. If there is a transition of power, I facilitate a relationship with the new people. If there is not, I facilitate the status quo. Either way, I facilitate.

PRICE: Wrong way!
REGIS: We're not looking for the guerillas.
CLAIRE: Then let us out.
SOLDIER: Lo siento! Go one more block.

CLAIRE: Then why did they bring us all the way here to see him?
ISELA: This is Commandante Cinco.
ISELA: Today we took Matagalpa. Leon is about to fall, and Masaya. And next week we could be in Managua but it is still possible to lose. In the last days of our final offensive the people of Nicaragua must know that Rafael is alive and Queremos un fotografia.
COMMANDANTE CINCO: Queremos un fotografia.
ISELA: We need a photograph. Come with us.
COMMANDANTE CINCO: Usted es un fotografo magnifico. Queremos que vive.
ISELA: ( to Claire ) Why is he laughing?
PRICE: You're crazy.
CINCO: ( in Spanish ) We have momentum, but many more lives will be lost. Even Washington is starting to admit that the butcher Somoza is not loved by his people. They have detained twenty-five million dollars in new arms shipments for Somoza at an airfield in Florida until they find out if Rafael is alive or dead. We know about these
CLAIRE: If Washington thinks Rafael is dead, they will ship the arms to Somoza. Do you understand.
PRICE: ( without enthusiasm ) Commandante. Soy un periodista.
CINCO: This has nothing to do with journalism there is more to the world than journalism. We are going to end this war with you or without you. People don't really believe in Rafael they believe in the idea of Rafael, no? Because for now the idea of Rafael is enough for the people of Nicaragua. When the war is over none of this
PRICE: I don't do things. like this.
CINCO: Enough lives have been lost already. It's difficult, I know but you must do it.
CINCO: In the morning, eh? When there's better light!

CLAIRE: It's disciplined. It civilized. It involves distinctions. I'm great at distinctions. I wish I wasn't so good at them. Sometimes I envy you you don't make any it's very The only time I don't worry about all those things is when I'm with my Or when you're in bed.
PRICE: Or when you're in bed.
CLAIRE: ( beat changes direction ) My job is to find a story, then tell a story whatever it is because I believe that if enough people hear enough stories then somehow, through information alone, we all have a better chance to survive. ( beat ) I believe in information. ( beat ) That's a very romantic streak I have running through me maybe it's a weakness. Information is good lack of information is bad. Simple, Not so simple.
PRICE: Not so simple.
CLAIRE: You're God damn right it's not. You take that picture you'll take it for all the right reasons I I'm not gonna take it.
PRICE: I'm not gonna take it.
CLAIRE: That's fine for you. But do I go back and say I interviewed Rafael? Do I go back and say I missed the biggest story of the war? Or do I say Rafael was stone cold dead that's the information, isn't it? Or do I say he entertained us all in his inimitably charismatic manner around the ol' revolutionary campfire? Can we throw up our arms and say we fell in love with the querillas because their cause was. Journalists don't fall in love. Which story do you want me to tell? Do what you want to do.
PRICE: Do what you want to do.
CLAIRE: Christ, what the fuck are we doing I want to be here. With you. What do you want. I want this war to end. I'm not going to tell the world that Rafael is dead.

He took care of you before you were He wouldn't understand.
PRICE: He wouldn't understand.
CLAIRE: Before Nicaragua you wouldn't understand. I'm not sure I exactly What are we going to do?
PRICE: I'll take Alex to find Rafael we'll go to Sebaco on the road to Matagalpa the Guardia heavily control the area and they're scared right now they'll never let us through. We won't be able to get near Rafael. Alex will understand and we'll turn around and drive back without a story.
CLAIRE: That's a lie!
PRICE: Tell me about lies!
CLAIRE: I don't want to tell him either.
PRICE: We may not be able to find him, I've got supreme confidence in you.
ALEX: I've got supreme confidence in you.
ALEX: Claire looks good, eh?
PRICE: Everybody looks good in the tropics.
ALEX: Since I haven't been able to find Isela since coming back, you're going to have to translate for me what the hell does that mean?
PRICE: Alex. I love her.
ALEX: And she 'thinks' she loves you.
PRICE: It's past the thinking stage.
ALEX: I'd like to know something it probably doesn't matter in the great final scheme of things. but I'm Did you ever lay a hand on her before she left me?
PRICE: That's the truth?
ALEX: That's the truth?

CLAIRE: I don't think it's Jazy.
PRICE: Oates said it was a Frog. How many Frenchmen you know around here? Jazy ain't 'facilitating' shit.
CLAIRE: Price, momentarily comfortable with the danger, responds quickly and finds the alarm wire running along the door jamb. LA GUARDIA TROOPS NEARBY HEAR THE ALARM and head toward INSIDE THE HOUSE PRICE FINDS THE ALARM BOX which he pries open and expertly pulls two wires. The alarm stops. Immediately they begin going through drawers and cupboards. She pulls out some harmless snapshots of Miss Panama, replaces

MISS PANAMA: Price and Claire return the greeting and continue out the EXT. JAZY'S HOUSE - THE SOUND OF MORTAR IN THE DISTANCE As they emerge, Claire tears a white cloth in half and ties it to a stick, handing half to Price who does likewise. An earth mover goes past, a Guardia soldier at the wheel. More soldiers cling to the machine, their guns at the ready.
PRICE: We've got to talk to Alex.
CLAIRE: You think our flags are big enough?
PRICE: This is what I want to show you.
ALEX: We drove through three roadblocks a half hour before curfew so you could show me a statue of Tacho.

CLAIRE: No! I wanted Rafael to be alive.
