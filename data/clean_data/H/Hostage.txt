MALIK'S VOICE: ( screaming from the house ) Fuck you!
LEIFITZ: I don't think he wants to talk.
TALLEY: Where's the guy's wife?
KEITH: She didn't take the kid to her sister's. The neighbors were wrong.
TALLEY: Goddamnit, you said we had her. I told him we had her!
KEITH: We got bad information, Talley. I can't pull her out of my ass!
MALIK: ( shouting at Talley ) You said my wife was gonna talk to me, you lying fuck! I'm gonna kill her dog, then shoot myself! I mean it!
TALLEY: ( to Keith ) Pull the dog's name out of your ass. Get the dog's name.
LEIFITZ: ( alarmed by Talley's move ) Talley! You're in the line of fire!
TALLEY: I didn't lie to you, George. You scared your wife pretty good last night. We're having a hard time finding her.
MALIK: She better talk to me! I'm gonna kill her goddamned dog!
TALLEY: You and I have been talking for, what, sixteen hours? Keep talking. Is that your dog, too?
MALIK'S VOICE: I don't know whose dog it is. She lied about everything else, so she probably lied about the dog.
TALLEY: I know you're hurting. You lose your job, you find out your wife's fucking another guy . . . but don't give up. We'll have her talk to you.
MALIK'S VOICE: Then why won't she open her mouth?! Why doesn't the bitch say something???
TALLEY: George? Come back to the window.
MALIK'S VOICE: STOP LOOKING AT ME!!!
