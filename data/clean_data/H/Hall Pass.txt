FRED: I don't careI'm not stopping 'til we get there!
RICK: Are you crazy?!
FRED: Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my ESTABLISHING SHOT OF A CAPE COD HOSPITAL - NIGHT Rick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ENTRANCE followed by the two police cruisers. When they stop, we see that somebody has spray-painted 'HORNY OLD MAN' on the side of the mini-van. Fred jumps out and SPRINTS toward the entrance. SEVERAL COPS spring from their cars and give chase. Before Fred can reach the front doors, he gets KNOCKED VIOLENTLY to the ground. Rick climbs out of the passenger seat with HIS HANDS RAISED.
RICK: Hear me out, gentlemen, I can explain every! AS A BURLY OFFICER'S HEAD CONNECTS WITH RICK'S CHEST, we.
FREEZE FRAME: .And FADE TO BLACK. and then:
RICK: I still have a few.
GUNNAR: Rick shoots him a look.
RICK: They're hidden. BACK ON TV SCREEN - A PRETTY GIRL with a knockout body comes up and puts her arms around Rick.
EMMA: Who's that girl?
RICK: That's Mommy.
EMMA: No, I mean the young one standing next to you.
RICK: That's Mommy.
EMMA: Mommy used to have long hair? And she wore a bikini?
RICK: ( WISTFULLY )
EMMA: How come she doesn't wear a bikini Is it because of her fat ass?
GUNNAR: Is it because of her fat ass?
RICK: I guess. What? No. Who said Mommy's got a fat ass?
GUNNAR: LONG BEAT. Well, uh, I don't appreciate that language, Gunnar. You've got the best mom in the whole worlddon't ever say anything bad about her. Just then, MAGGIE comes GRUNTING into the room carrying a ONE- YEAR-OLD BABY in one arm and a basket of laundry in the other. She's in her late-30's, cute, with short, manageable mommy hair. She's wearing SWEATPANTS, an OVERSIZED T-SHIRT, and NO MAKE-UP.

MAGGIE: I know, I know, I'm trying.
RICK: Well how long you gonna be?
MAGGIE: Forty-five minutessooner if you help with the kids. Maggie looks to him, hopeful.
RICK: ( NONCHALANT )
AND WE: CUT TO:
RICK: I miss going out with you on Saturday nights. She smiles at him.
MAGGIE: I know, it's just like the old Rick pulls Maggie close as they walk.
RICK: Maybe we should make a rule that we go out at least six nights a week without the kids. Maggie GIGGLES.
MAGGIE: You gotta be kidding me? Maggie pulls away.
RICK: You just checked out that girl's I did?
MAGGIE: You just checked out that girl's I did?
RICK: I did?
MAGGIE: Yeah, you did, and it's rude.
RICK: Why? You think she saw me?
MAGGIE: saw you.
RICK: Oh, uh, yeah. I'm sorry, honey, I'm just kind of spacey today.
MAGGIE: Grace, let me ask you something: Does Fred ever check out other women in front of you?
GRACE: No, Fred's not a gawker. Grace pats a pleased-looking Fred on the head.
GRACE: Dr. Lucy! Congratulations!
DR. LUCY: Girls, thank you so much for Dr. Lucy speaks with a FRENCH ACCENT.
MAGGIE: Are you kidding me? You're the only friend of ours who ever got an awardyou think we're going to miss that? ANGLE ON Rick and Fred standing at the bar.
FRED: Do you mind telling me how your wife catches you checking out another girl? What is this, amateur The BARTENDER delivers a couple beers and Rick pays.
RICK: The girl walked past and I glanced back at her for like half a second.
FRED: There's your problem, dumb-ass it's the wrong order. You don't wait for the girl to walk past and then glance back. You turn when she's still fifteen feet in front of you.then you wait for her to walk into your line of vision. Fred NOTICES an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walking toward them from the Before the woman reaches them, Fred turns to his left and holds the look until the Attractive Woman's ASS ENTERS HIS VIEW and he watches her walk away.
RICK: ( GETTING IT )
MISSY: ( CALLING back to them ) Don't forget to mingle! The guys watch Missy walk away.
FRED: Wow. Missy's looking pretty good for someone going through a Yeah, that's rough stuffI heard they might have to sell the house.
RICK: Yeah, that's rough stuffI heard they might have to sell the house.
FRED: Too bad. You gonna hit 'em up for the listing?
RICK: What am I, a vulture? Nah, I don't go after the divorcee business unless they approach me first.
FRED: Yeah, it's kind of tacky, huh? As the guys crane their necks to get a better view of Missy's ass, we. REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Maggie, Grace and Dr. Lucy sipping lemondrops and watching Rick and Fred from across the room.
GRACE: Look at those two meatheads checking out Missy Frankenfield. What, do they think they're invisible over there?
MAGGIE: I thought you said Fred wasn't a He was standing right next to you. I can't let him know that I know that would take all the fun out of You should see him. He's got some stupid move where he looks back before the girl passes to make it seem like he couldn't help but notice her ass. It's pathetic. Maggie and Dr. Lucy GIGGLE.
GRACE: He was standing right next to you. I can't let him know that I know that would take all the fun out of You should see him. He's got some stupid move where he looks back before the girl passes to make it seem like he couldn't help but notice her ass. It's pathetic. Maggie and Dr. Lucy GIGGLE.
RICK: How about I drive the babysitter home while you go upstairs and prepare the altar? He puts his arm around her as they walk toward the front I want to, honey, but I've got to get up early with the kids.
MAGGIE: I want to, honey, but I've got to get up early with the kids.
RICK: I'll get up with the kids.
MAGGIE: But I have to go out and buy a gift- -they're going to a birthday party I'll cjet the gift, then I'll take the kids to the park, then to the party. You can dust stay in bed,, get your beauty sleep, and bask in the sweet, sweet pounding I'm about to give you.
RICK: I'll cjet the gift, then I'll take the kids to the park, then to the party. You can dust stay in bed,, get your beauty sleep, and bask in the sweet, sweet pounding I'm about to give you.
MAGGIE: I love it when you sweet-talk me. Maggie smiles but as Rick opens the front door they FREEZE IN
GUNNAR: Mommy! Daddy!
RICK: ( DEFLATED )
RICK: How were the kids tonight?
PAIGE: Perfect. That Gunnar is so cute all he wants to do is wrestle with Rick smiles at this.
RICK: Oh, uh, sure, I'm sorry. Flustered, he moves to the temperature control which in LARGE ILLUMINATED DIGITAL TYPE reads: 69!!! He quickly PUNCHES THE A/C OFF, then trains his eyes straight ahead and grips the steering wheel tight at ten-and-two.
PAIGE: Thank you.
RICK: EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT The mini-van pulls up in front of a sorority house.
PAIGE: Mr. Mills, can I ask you something?
RICK: I was wondering.
PAIGE: I was wondering.
RICK: Buy you some.. .How old are you?
PAIGE: Twenty. But I'm turning twenty-one next week.
RICK: Oh. Happy birthday. That's a Yeah. My aunt usually buys beer for me, but she's out of town.
PAIGE: Yeah. My aunt usually buys beer for me, but she's out of town.
RICK: Uh, I don't know, Paige.I could get in a lot of trouble for giving alcohol to a minor.
PAIGE: Oh, come on, I'm a junior in college. You drank when you were in college, didn't you?
RICK: Well, uh.
PAIGE: Besides, it's so arbitrary. How does it make sense that twenty's old enough to fight in Iraq or watch a porno movie, but it's too young to drink a beer? Rick shifts in his seat.
RICK: Really? Twenty's old enough to Fight in Iraq?
PAIGE: Fight in Iraq?
RICK: No, the other thing.
PAIGE: Watch Porn? Oh, God yeahhalf the girls in those things are my age. Rick catches a hint of cleavage, a flash of leg.
RICK: I'm sorry, Paige, I can't do that.
PAIGE: Why not?
RICK: Well. it would be.. .inappropriate. Rick's voice has taken on a firmer, more adult tone. Paige seems amused by it.
PAIGE: What, is that your grown-up voice?
COME ON: No, Paige. ( with an edge ) What are you thinking? I'm a married man and I have a family. You think they'd like it if they knew I was hanging out at the lake, all alone, drinking beer with a college girl?
RICK: No, Paige. ( with an edge ) What are you thinking? I'm a married man and I have a family. You think they'd like it if they knew I was hanging out at the lake, all alone, drinking beer with a college girl?
PAIGE: ( PUT-OFF )
RICK: All right, better get inside. She opens the car door, then glares back at him.
PAIGE: Ewww. What the hell were you Go ahead. Scoot along now. As she SLAMS the car door, we.
RICK: Go ahead. Scoot along now. As she SLAMS the car door, we.
MAGGIE: Shhhh. He just fell asleep.
RICK: Rick playfully pinches Maggie's butt as he follows her into their bedroom where.
EMMA: Can I sleep with you tonight?
RICK: No. Absolutely not. Maggie, clearly softening to the idea, shrugs at Rick.
EMMA: No. Absolutely not. Maggie, clearly softening to the idea, shrugs at Rick.
RICK: No. Absolutely not. Maggie, clearly softening to the idea, shrugs at Rick.
EMMA: Well.. .can someone read me a story? Rick looks at Maggie, then at his daughter.
RICK: Okay, one quick story. Come on, jump on my back. Emma jumps on Rick's back.
RICK: Okay, honey, this is the last pony and then night-night. Emma finishes putting on a rubberband, then looks at him, There. You look pretty, Daddy.
EMMA: There. You look pretty, Daddy.
RICK: Okay, now give me a kiss, hug and go to sleep. She lays back on her pillow. Rick gives her a big kiss on both cheeks.
EMMA: I love you, too, Daddy.
F: INT. RICK & MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS Rick scrambles into the room and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.
RICK: No. Please, no. Rick wants to wake her up but sees that she needs the sleep, so he just PULLS THE COVERS OVER HER SHOULDERS. As Rick walks around the bed and INTO THE BATHROOM in the b.g., we HOLD ON MAGGIE until she OPENS HER EYES. She listens to her husband brush his teeth with perhaps a tinge of GUILT, and when he shuts off the faucet, she CLOSES HER EYES AGAIN, and we.
FRED: Hey. How'd you make out?
RICK: Hey. How'd you make out?
FRED: Great. Lost both sets.
RICK: So'd you get the business? Fred nods and wipes his brow.
FRED: Pretty sure I got the Auto and Home. He told me to call his accountant on Monday about the Fred looks around at all the pretty MOMS and NANNIES with their CHILDREN.
RICK: Fred looks around at all the pretty MOMS and NANNIES with their CHILDREN.
FRED: Can you believe the talent here Yeah. I know. They NOTICE something O.S.. THEIR POV - we see a SCANDINAVIAN AU PAIR bent over EXPOSING HER THONG UNDERWEAR as she picks up a CHILD from a wagon.
RICK: ( PAINED )
FRED: Rick SIGHS.
RICK: CPR girl's back, too. Rick nods toward A PIG-TAILED PARAMEDIC, early 30's, TEACHING A CPR CLASS. The two men look on solemnly.
FRED: Imagine if we were coming here back when we were single?
RICK: ( FALSE BRAVADO )
EMMA: Monkey bars! The kids JUMP off the swings and RUN for the jungle gym.
GUNNAR: Me first! Rick trails them like a Sherpa carrying a couple Razor scooters and a basketball as Fred tags along. They shlep past THE TRI-DELTA SORORITY playing ultimate frisbee and
FRED: So you get lucky last night?
RICK: Nah, the kids were up when we got home. How 'bout you?
FRED: Well, kinda lucky. Grace conked right out so I snuck out to the car and rubbed one out. Rick shoots Fred a look.
RICK: The car? What are you Knight Rider? Why didn't you just go in the bathroom like a normal guy?
FRED: And get caught by Grace? Can't risk it. Besides, cars turn me onit's where I lost my virginity. And they're comfyI just put the seat back and turn on the tunes. The guys sit on a bench.
RICK: That's one of the things they don't tell you when you're youngthat you'll still be jerking-off after you get married. I thought it was dust gonna be a teenage thing.
FRED: Yeah, I didn't see that one coming. The two men sit in silence for a LONG BEAT as the Frisbee Girls play all around them.
RICK: The arch.
FRED: The arch.
RICK: What arch?
FRED: You know when you're taking a girl's panties off for the first time, and you're wondering if she's going to stop you, but then she gives you that little pelvic arch- thrust that tells you that the struggle's over, everything's going to be okay? Rick SIGHS.
RICK: That's a happy moment.
FRED: Yep. Another thing gone forever. Rick looks at his watch.
RICK: I should get going, I have to drop the kids off at a birthday party.
FRED: You want to grab a coffee after?
RICK: Do you have any interest in going down to the Patriot's training camp one of these days?
FRED: Are you kidding, I'd love that. Except.I always feel kind of pathetic waiting in line for Tom Brady's autograph.
RICK: Fred, I was planning on bringing the kids.
FRED: Genius! That's the perfect cover! Rick shoots him a look then REACTS to something O.S.
RICK: HIS POV - SLO-MO of a BEAUTIFUL GIRL walking toward him. Her straight brown hair shimmers.. .her blue eyes twinkle.. .her white uniformed blouse is unbuttoned enough to reveal a tasteful amount of CLEAVAGE. This is COFFEE GIRL, 23, granola, fresh, Australian, spacey. BACK ON THE GUYS staring in awe.
FRED: Did you see her face? Her face is ( chanting, scared ) Please don't have a nice ass, please don't have a nice ass. But as she turns to pour a cup of coffee, we see that HER ASS IS SPECTACULAR. Rick turns away, annoyed.
RICK: ( chanting, scared ) Please don't have a nice ass, please don't have a nice ass. But as she turns to pour a cup of coffee, we see that HER ASS IS SPECTACULAR. Rick turns away, annoyed.
FRED: I know. She's from Australia. Been working here about a month.
RICK: Why'd you have to bring me here?!
FRED: Okay, cool it, tigerhere she Coffee Girl steps up to the counter and smiles at Fred.
COFFEE GIRL: ( AUSTRALIAN ACCENT )
RICK: ( STUNNED )
COFFEE GIRL: ( re: Rick's shirt ) Hey, Old Navy, you like a muffin with that?
RICK: Uh, sure. What do you recommend?
COFFEE GIRL: They're all good. The Wannabe Artist-Type steps protectively up beside Coffee I'd go with the bran muffinyou guys are probably having digestive issues at your age, right? Rick flinches at this, then turns to Coffee Girl.
WANNABE: I'd go with the bran muffinyou guys are probably having digestive issues at your age, right? Rick flinches at this, then turns to Coffee Girl.
RICK: I'll have a blueberry muffin Make it a bran muffin for me. Rick shoots Fred a look, clearly annoyed. As Coffee Girl turns to get their order, we go to.
FRED: Make it a bran muffin for me. Rick shoots Fred a look, clearly annoyed. As Coffee Girl turns to get their order, we go to.
RICK: Did you notice she's from Cleavage, Yeah. I bet her areolas look like a couple of pepperoni slices. Fred trains his eyes back on Coffee Girl and SQUINTS

FRED: ( UNDER BREATH )
RICK: He's right though. Fred looks at Rick.
FRED: I don't see what the big deal is we're not hurting anyone. What is he Big Brotherhe's gonna tell me what I can look at now? For God sakes, don't take that away from me- -it's all I got! As Rick thinks about this, we.
BAKER: Rick, you open. Rick takes a fresh DOLLAR BILL off the pile in front of him and STUDIES THE SERIAL NUMBERS.
RICK: Four 9's.
FRED: Hey, where's Coakley? How come he didn't show?
GARY: Vegas. Hawaiian Tropic finals. The guys nod their approval.
BAKER: Man, imagine being Coakley? The guy's single, he's loaded, chicks love him, he doesn't have to answer to anybody.
GARY: That's the life.
FRED: That is the life.
GARY: How's it possible to know that my wife won't find out?
FLATS: But would I still have memory of Oh yeah. Great memories.
GARY: Oof. I think I'd pay 500 bucks for Baker shoots him a look.
BAKER: You cheap,bastard. We're talking about an investment that gets your rocks off and protects your wife's feelings. I'd pay five grand.
RICK: Well, excuse me, Mr. Wall Street, but us public school teachers aren't getting any of that bail-out money you're over-tipping everyone Just then, the front door OPENS and Maggie ENTERS.
GARY: Well, excuse me, Mr. Wall Street, but us public school teachers aren't getting any of that bail-out money you're over-tipping everyone Just then, the front door OPENS and Maggie ENTERS.
MAGGIE: Hey, guys.
RICK: Oh, hey, honey. How was the book What did you guys read this month?
MAGGIE: What did you guys read this month?
FRED: What did you guys read this month?
MAGGIE: Old Man and the Sea?
GARY: Old Man and the Sea?
MAGGIE: No, Muriel's yoga book. The guys LAUGH.
RICK: Gunnar and Emma stalled for a while, but they weren't bad.
MAGGIE: How about the baby? Rick points to the BABY MONITOR in the middle of the table.
RICK: Not a peep.
MAGGIE: Great job. Now win some money, She kisses Rick and walks out of the room.
GARY: I wish I could drink tequila. It's a great buzz but it always gives me the spins and then I have to go home early.
FRED: You want to know a sure cure for the spins? Fred puts a hand over his right eye.
RICK: Or you could find a nice 12-step INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER As Maggie gets to the top of the stairs, she can hear the O.S. SOUND OF THE BABY CRYING. She walks down the hall, opens the Baby's door and REACTS. HER POV - the exhausted and sweaty Baby is standing in his crib, SOBBING. The baby monitor is on the dresser next to the crib BLARING out LAUGHTER from the poker game.
MAGGIE: Oh, you poor thing. She hurries to the Baby and PICKS HIM UP.
BAKER: Pfttt. Hog-head, your ass doesn't have seven-five. More LAUGHTER from the guys as Rick deals out fresh bills.
FLATS: So what's your number, Rick?
RICK: Oh jeez, Flats, I don't know.
FRED: Come on.. any girl you choose. You get to do anything you want with her, and your wife will never find out. It's completely harmless, a one-time thingwhat would you pay for that? BACK ON MAGGIE as she cradles her baby and LEANS CLOSER to the monitor.
MAGGIE: What wouldn't you pay?!
RICK: I didn't really mean it, honey. ( scared, defenseless ) They kind of put me on the spot. Look, some of the other guys were throwing out some pretty hefty What does that have to do with Well. I'm the host of the party, I didn't want to be a buzz-kill.
MAGGIE: What does that have to do with Well. I'm the host of the party, I didn't want to be a buzz-kill.
RICK: Well. I'm the host of the party, I didn't want to be a buzz-kill.
MAGGIE: How is having sex with a hooker protecting me and the kids?
RICK: No one said anything about hookers.
MAGGIE: You were paying for sexwhat would you call her?
RICK: ( WEAKLY )
GRACE: Fred said five grand? What a You know what's even funnier? Hog- head McCormick said he'd pay seven What?! That bum hasn't worked since the dot-com busthis wife supports The girls LAUGH.
MAGGIE: You know what's even funnier? Hog- head McCormick said he'd pay seven What?! That bum hasn't worked since the dot-com busthis wife supports The girls LAUGH.
GRACE: What?! That bum hasn't worked since the dot-com busthis wife supports The girls LAUGH.
MAGGIE: Sometimes I wonder if it would be better if they did cheat and get it over with.
DR. LUCY: You mean, rather than take the slow boat to resentment? The girls look to Dr. Lucy.
GRACE: A what?
DR. LUCY: A hall pass. A week off from Grace and Maggie stop chewing.
MAGGIE: Wait a minute. . .Are you saying let them go out and cheat?
DR. LUCY: I'm saying give them a week off from marriage.
GRACE: That's Fred. He thinks because he sees big tits everywhere and then still comes home for dinner that I should be welcoming him at the door like some conquering hero. Dr. Lucy smiles.
DR. LUCY: Well, maybe it's time to let them go out there and find out what it's really like.
MAGGIE: Wow. You're talking about the nuclear option. Maggie ponders the idea.
GRACE: And remind me again, what good could possibly come from this.?
DR. LUCY: There's a wonderful principle in psychology called 'reactance theory.' It basically states that if you're constantly told you can't do something, you want to do it more than ever. And conversely, if you remove the taboo, you remove the obsession. Grace makes a 't' sound.
GRACE: ( SARCASTIC )
DR. LUCY: Oh, I have. Grace and Maggie REACT to this.
MAGGIE: You're telling us you let Charlie sleep with another woman? Dr. Lucy takes a moment before answering.
DR. LUCY: I am not telling you that. I am telling you that I gave him the freedom to choose for himself.
GRACE: DR. LUCY All I know is.our marriage is better than ever. Grace and Maggie think about this.
DR. LUCY: All I know is.our marriage is better than ever. Grace and Maggie think about this.
GRACE: I don't know. There's a reason that men evolved and apes didn't. It's because women demanded more. Without a wife, Einstein would've been humping a maple tree all day. As the women LAUGH, we
GRACE: There he is! The lord of the manor!
ED: Come on, everyone in the shack! The grand tour's about to begin!
ED: I call it headquarters. LARRY BOHAC, mid-40's, and his blonde bombshell of a wife, MANDY, ( who wears A TOO-TIGHT T-SHIRT ) look around in awe.
MANDY: That's sweet of you to say, Mandy.
ED: That's sweet of you to say, Mandy.
LARRY: It's epic, Ed. Ed points to one wall which houses a GLASSED-IN HUMIDOR.
ED: ( RE: HUMIDOR )
KIMMY: Wait a second, Ed, first I want to show them Lny headquarters. Fred looks at Rick and rolls his eyes.
KIMMY: It's my paradise.
ED: With a price tag north of one hundred and forty large, it better be paradise. Ed holds out his fist and Rick obediently POUNDS IT. Just then Grace NOTICES that Fred has disappeared.
GRACE: Hey, where did Fred go? Rick turns and sees that he's missing.
RICK: What are you doing?
FRED: I can't take these look-at-how-much- I-own parties. It's obnoxious. Rick nods and sits down beside him.
RICK: Well, kind of. You made me drive around town with you for two hours, I thought you'd want to watch a movie in a mini-van. You never got to watch a movie in a mini-van before, did you? Rick shrugs.
FRED: ( DEFENSIVE )
RICK: Why'd you have to hook your boat up to it?
FRED: Because it's the Touring Edition, numb-skull. The thing can tow more weight than ninety percent of the pick-ups out there!
KIMMY: The mantle actually came all the way from Tuscany, which is in Hey, gang, check this out.
ED: Hey, gang, check this out.
KIMMY: Oh God, Eddie, they don't need to see thatthey'll think we're Ed PUNCHES A CODE into a keypad and the WALL SLIDES OPEN revealing a SAFE ROOM.
MAGGIE: Oh my God. this is like secret agent stuff.
KIMMY: I think having a safe room is a bit over the top, but Ed feels with our two little ones you can never be too cautious.
GRACE: Aw, you're such a good daddy.
MAGGIE: ( aside to Grace ) Rick can't even set up the baby monitors right. Ed points to a monitor where we see Rick and Fred ENTER the master bedroom.
ED: Here come Tweedle-dee and Tweedle- CLOSE ON VIDEO MONITOR - we see Rick and Fred cross over to the master bathroom doorway and look in.
GRACE: ( CALLING OUT )
KIMMY: They can't hear you. The room's completely soundproof.
ED: And bulletproof. and ENTER ANOTHER.
RICK: They must've gone downstairs. Fred motions to Ed's humidor room.
FRED: ( BRITISH ACCENT )
GRACE: Uh, maybe we should turn this off. But Ed turns THE VOLUME UP. CLOSE ON MONITOR - Rick plays along with a BAD BRITISH
GRACE: ( under breath; resigned ) Here we go.
RICK: Hey, speaking of installations, is that a shiny new set of cans on Mandy Bohac?
FRED: Either that or she's wearing her daughter's t-shirt.
RICK: They look good but I'll still take the real deal any day.
FRED: Right. You're telling me you'd take Kimmy Long's flapjacks over Mandy's new speedbags?
RICK: That's what I'm telling you. I like boobs with a little mileage on 'em. They're more fun.
FRED: Yeah. You can smoosh 'em, swing 'em, hump 'em, Stretch-Armstrong And what about the proven correlation between floppy boobs and large-mouth vaginas?
RICK: Yeah. You can smoosh 'em, swing 'em, hump 'em, Stretch-Armstrong And what about the proven correlation between floppy boobs and large-mouth vaginas?
FRED: And what about the proven correlation between floppy boobs and large-mouth vaginas?
KIMMY: You people are horrible! Horrible!
ED: ( CALLING OUT )
FRED: Uh, anyone thinking chocolate chip cookie dough in a waffle cone? Grace YANKS the mini-van to the side of the road and GLARES
GRACE: Large-mouth vaginas?! As the guys cower, we
MAGGIE: You know what really troubles me? The thing that you're all so obsessed with is meaningless to you. It's really just about numbers with you guys. Rick looks up, confused.
RICK: Well, virginity is different for The point is, obviously I like sex, tooit means something to mebut I don't walk around gawking at every guy I see.
MAGGIE: The point is, obviously I like sex, tooit means something to mebut I don't walk around gawking at every guy I see.
RICK: All right, so I occasionally notice other women. I'm sorry.
MAGGIE: Rick rakes his hands through his hair and decides to come Okay, you want the truth? You really want me to pull back the curtain here? From the moment I leave the house in the morning 'til the moment I get home, I pretty much notice every woman in my path. Maggie turns to face him.
RICK: Okay, you want the truth? You really want me to pull back the curtain here? From the moment I leave the house in the morning 'til the moment I get home, I pretty much notice every woman in my path. Maggie turns to face him.
MAGGIE: ( HURT )
RICK: No. Of course I'm happy, honeyour sex life is greatnot that I wouldn't mind a little more, but look, one thing has nothing to do with the other. I think about sex a lotall guys dothat's just the way it is. Maggie sits down beside him, clearly at the end of her rope. No one speaks for a few moments. Then:
MAGGIE: I'm giving you a hall pass.
RICK: A what?
MAGGIE: One week off from marriage.
RICK: You mean, like a trial separation? You are seriously overreacting.
MAGGIE: It's not a separation, it's a hall pass. You can do whatever you want. Get it out of your system.
RICK: ( BEAT )
MAGGIE: It's not a yes or no offer, and it's not a debate. You're getting a hall pass. As Maggie heads upstairs, we PUSH IN on a confused Rick.
RICK: ( not facing him ) There's a couple hard-boiled eggs in a bowl there for you.
MAGGIE: ( not facing him ) There's a couple hard-boiled eggs in a bowl there for you.
RICK: I'm gonna have to take them to go, hon, I've got a showing in fifteen Rick puts the eggs in his pocket, then approaches Maggie and kisses her on the cheek.
MAGGIE: I told you, this isn't negotiable. She turns and faces him.
RICK: You're really serious about this?
MAGGIE: Rick, this isn't something that I.look, I really think you need this. I think we need this. Rick doesn't know what to say.

FRED: That's a good oneexcept for one thing: We don't have a puppy, so when she gets there she'll realize we're full of shit. Rick shoots him a look.
RICK: I don't think it's supposed to be for real. It's just to make her laugh so she'll talk to you. Fred considers this.
FRED: Oh God no, it doesn't work on that level. Here, this is my favorite. He takes the paper from Rick.
RICK: It's a charmer but you know what? We don't need phony pick-up lines. Why don't we just be ourselves?
FRED: Great. If you know how to. Rick takes a DEEP BREATH and braces himself.

WANNABE: Enjoy your two-Splenda'd iced coffee, mister. Rick starts to go, then turns around and stares at Wannabe. Wannabe, comforted by the counter between them, smiles back.
RICK: Why are you smiling? You think this counter is some alligator-infested Rick's stare becomes a glare and Wannabe loses his smile.
RICK: You do? Leigh nods and starts to straighten up the tables.
LEIGH: I don't really squat, just run on the hamster-wheel everyday after She starts wiping down a table.
COFFEE GIRL: So did you go to Harvard? She nods at Rick's t-shirt.
RICK: ( BEAT )
LEIGH: Great place. Real chill. And they have a bar, so I always grab a beer after my workout.
RICK: Bitchin'. Sounds like a nice routine. Maybe I'll routine it, If you join, tell 'em Leigh sent youthey'll give me two free I'll do that, Leigh.
LEIGH: If you join, tell 'em Leigh sent youthey'll give me two free I'll do that, Leigh.
RICK: I'll do that, Leigh.
LEIGH: Leigh gives him the peace sign.
RICK: R-O-C-K in the U-S-A. Leigh smiles and as she heads back inside, we
FRED: Hey, Missy, this is Fred Searing. I . uh, I dust wanted to give you a ring and, um.well, give me a call when you get back. It's kind of an emergency. Well, not life- threatening, but The machine CUTS HIM OFF. Fred HANGS UP, dejected. He sits there for a BEAT, then grabs his keys and GOES OUT THE DOOR.
FRED: Oh, hi. Kimmy nods blankly. The Daughter glares at him. Fred nervously steps up next to them in line, passing time as he waits for the sidewalk to clear.
FRED: That's right. ( looks at watch ) Well, gotta get goingI have a meeting across town in ten minutes. See ya. Fred EXITS.
FRED: I'd prefer no paper trail.
FRED: I don't think my insurance company's gonna cover this one.
FRED: Uh, no.
FRED: Look, I don't really want this in The Young Korean Woman hands him back the form.
FRED: Um, couldn't I just tell you? She stares at him for a LONG BEAT.
FRED: How about a C-note so I don't have to fill out any forms or show any The Young Korean Woman thinks about this for a moment, then SLIDES OPEN THE ACCORDION WALL behind her, REVEALING. THE DRY CLEANERS NEXT DOOR - the Dry Cleaning Korean Lady looks back at him, along with Kimmy Long, her daughter, and
SONG: .Night fever, night fever.. .we know how to do it.' As the song heats up, the crowd parts, REVEALING. Rick Coleman and Gerry decked-out in WHITE, TONY-MANARO-SUITS. They're DANCING UP A STORM with Maggie and Grace who are thrilled to be in such capable hands. Grace is getting tossed around a bit, but it's clear that Maggie can hold her own on a dance floor.
RICK COLEMAN: Wow. You can really move out there. Maggie shrugs modestly.
MAGGIE: Thanks. I was a dance major in Really? I always wonderedwhat do you do with a degree in dance?
RICK COLEMAN: Really? I always wonderedwhat do you do with a degree in dance?
MAGGIE: Well, as it turned out, nothing.
RICK COLEMAN: Why not?
MAGGIE: I don't know, you get busy, kids, school, there's so much going on.
RICK COLEMAN: Well you gotta make time for the stuff you love or you'll forget who you are. Maggie appreciates the sentiment. She makes strong eye- contact with Rick for a moment, but catches herself and looks You know, my husband's name is Rick smiles at this.
MAGGIE: You know, my husband's name is Rick smiles at this.
RICK COLEMAN: Well that makes me the perfect guy to have an affair withyou'd never have to worry about screaming out the wrong name during sex. Maggie smiles at this, but she seems a nick uncomfortable.
MAGGIE: I know.
RICK COLEMAN: Now come on, let's go find Grace and get something to eat. I'm As they head back to the party, we
FLATS: Hey, Rick.
RICK: ( STARTLED )
FLATS: Great. What's up with you? How's that hall pass thing going? Rick makes a Scooby Doo sound, alarmed.
RICK: Who told you about thatwas it Hog- No. Some old lady was yakking about it down at the post office. Rick REACTS to this.
FLATS: No. Some old lady was yakking about it down at the post office. Rick REACTS to this.
RICK: ( DEFENSIVE )
FLATS: ( DUBIOUS )
RICK: Uh, Flatsy, I gotta run. I'm late for my work-out appointment. When Rick hops out of his car, we see that he's wearing gym shorts and an old Springsteen t-shirt. He hesitates, then grabs a SWEATSHIRT out of the car and TIES IT AROUND HIS WAIST. Rick hurries down the sidewalk toward Leigh.
LEIGH: ( SMILING )
FLATS: Hey, Rick! Good luck with the As Flats begins to LAUGH, a sheepish Rick scurries into the INT. FITNESS FIRM HEALTH CLUB - MOMENTS LATER Rick and Leigh stand at the front desk. A young, buff dude, CLYDE, looks up from folding towels.
LEIGH: Clyde, this is my friend, uh.
RICK: He's looking to join.
LEIGH: He's looking to join.
CLYDE: Great. I'll get you signed up. Leigh pats Rick's hand.
LEIGH: See ya.
RICK: So, uh, are you gonna grab a brewski after your work-out?
LEIGH: Rick looks disappointed.
RICK: Peace it! As soon as he hears himself, Rick cringes.
RICK: What's that aboutyou swimming the English Channel? The Metrosexual shoots Rick an annoyed look.
METROSEXUAL: Nah, Just not into looking like the knuckle-dragging guy on the evolution-of-man chart. Off Rick looking self-consciously down at his fur-covered body, we go.
RICK: He bunches up his towel and puts it behind his head, then settles in and CLOSES HIS EYES.
RICK: ( WEAKLY )
RICK: ( WINDED )
RICK: What time is it?
RICK: About three hours. That's when Rick realizes that his head is RESTING ON THE GUY'S COCK. He tries to roll off him, but Metrosexual #1
RICK: I'm okay, just help me up.
RICK: Okay, thanks, guys. I can take it from here. The metrosexuals release Rick and he gets about two steps before his LEGS GIVE OUT and he TUMBLES DOWN A SMALL FLIGHT
DAY 6: INT. RICK AND FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY A depressed Rick and Fred sit in bed numbing their pain by WATCHING THE BOURNE SUPREMACY and eating a couple PINTS OF
FRED: We let down the male species.
RICK: All right, don't give up.
FRED: I'm not giving up, I'm facing facts- -this is our last day and we got nothing cooking. Maybe you were right. Maybe we should just tell the girls to come home.
RICK: No. I want the hall pass. Fred looks at Rick, surprised.
FRED: I'm not even sure I know what the dream is anymore.
RICK: I just.I just want to know what it's like to be with another woman.
FRED: Well, just pull up one of the golden oldies in your spank bank it's almost like being there.
RICK: I don't have anything in that spank I'm talking about all the girls before you met Maggie. Rick doesn't say anything.
FRED: I'm talking about all the girls before you met Maggie. Rick doesn't say anything.
RICK: ( DEFENSIVE )
FRED: Wow. That's a really creepy story. Just then Fred's cell phone RINGS and he ANSWERS it.
RICK: Who was that?
FRED: Just an angel from heaven. Suddenly Fred jumps to his feet.
MAGGIE: Does this mean you're going steady?
GRACE: ( GUILTY )
MAGGIE: Grace, you should be flattered. You're thirty-eight-years-old and college kids are still swooning over you.
GRACE: Well I just feel bad if I gave him the wrong impression.
MAGGIE: The wrong impression? What makes you think thatI mean, besides the flowers, I.D. bracelet, and love Maggie picks up a card.
GRACE: Thanks for piling on. Grace stands up and SIGHS.
RICK: What are you doing?
FRED: Just texting Missy Frankenfield that we're going to be at Enter the DragonI'm covering all my bases.
RICK: You don't need Missy Frankenfield tonight. If we can't get the job done with Coakley as our wingman, then we're pathetic. Just then, Fred NOTICES something O.S.
FRED: All right, here come da man! CLOSE ON RESTAURANT ENTRANCE - a suave, DEBONAIR MAN ( played by George Clooney ) comes through the doors and stops to check out the room. Rick and Fred jump up and approach him WITH OPEN ARMS but at the last second Clooney steps aside REVEALING a THIN, BALDING MAN dressed HEAD-TO-TOE IN MOTORCYCLE LEATHERS ( think Larry David. )
COAKLEY: My two favorite nutsuckershow the hell are ya?! The three men hug, then Coakley nods toward Clooney.
RICK: No, who?
COAKLEY: George Clooney.
FRED: What's he doing here?
COAKLEY: I don't knowmust be shooting a movie or something.
FRED: Huh. Look, man, we've got a situation on our hands.
COAKLEY: Yeah, yeah, Baker filled me in. S'been rough sledding, huh? Coakley puts his arms around the two guys.
COAKLEY: I'm gonna need three-hundred bucks.
FRED: For what? Coakley shoots him a look.
COAKLEY: If you're really serious about this, stop questioning me. The guys look at each other, then reluctantly COUGH UP THE DOUGH. With money in hand, Coakley marches confidently across the street followed by Fred and Rick. When the SLICK BOUNCER sees them approaching, he PARTS THE CROWD.
SLICK BOUNCER: Good evening, Mr. Coakley.
COAKLEY: What up, my guy? Coakley PASSES ON THE MONEY with a handshake and the Bouncer UNHOOKS THE VELVET ROPE. Then Coakley smiles back at Fred and Rick.
COAKLEY: Okay, guys, you tried it your way and you railed miserably. You struck out, you were oh-for- everything. So now we do it my way, which is. The guys look at Coakley like Richard Gere looks at the Dalai . Go ugly early. Rick and Fred are visibly deflated.
RICK: Aren't you the guy who goes to the Hawaiian Tropic finals every year? Is that for the ugly girls?
COAKLEY: I go to the Tropic finals because Miss North Dakota's gonna lose and she's gonna need a hug. And quite often you can parlay a hug into a hand-job. Rick, you're upget us two bottles of Moet and six Rick shoots Fred a look, then weaves his way through a scrum of PEOPLE up to the bar. He tries to flag down a bartender but can't get anyone's attention.
RICK: Oh, hey, Paige. What are you doing She pulls out her license and holds it up.
PAIGE: I turned twenty-one yesterday.
RICK: Oh. Well, happy birthday. You out Yeah, I'm here with my Aunt Meg. Paige points across the club to AUNT MEG, a striking redhead, early 40's, who's talking to a couple of YOUNG MEN.
PAIGE: Yeah, I'm here with my Aunt Meg. Paige points across the club to AUNT MEG, a striking redhead, early 40's, who's talking to a couple of YOUNG MEN.
RICK: Rick continues to try to get the bartender's attention.
PAIGE: So, Rick, how's the hall pass Paige smirks at Rick who shrinks a little.
RICK: No, of course notwhat did you just say?
PAIGE: I was asking about your hall pass. ( off Rick's look ) I baby-sit for the Putneys and I heard Gary talking about it the other night at their barbecue. Rick REACTS to this.
RICK: He was talking about it at a Oh, he wasn't saying it in a bad In fact, I thought it was very classy of you to be staying at the Holiday Inn Express instead of bringing girls back to your home with all the kids' pictures and schoolwork taped up everywhere. Rick forces a smile.
PAIGE: Oh, he wasn't saying it in a bad In fact, I thought it was very classy of you to be staying at the Holiday Inn Express instead of bringing girls back to your home with all the kids' pictures and schoolwork taped up everywhere. Rick forces a smile.
RICK: Thank you. A male BARTENDER, 25, finally appears in front of Rick.
PAIGE: So does it work both ways?
RICK: The hall pass. Does your wife get one, too.
PAIGE: The hall pass. Does your wife get one, too.
RICK: ( AMUSED )
PAIGE: Oh. Who made that rule?
RICK: Well .um. As Rick thinks about this, Paige moves in tighter.
PAIGE: By the way, I kind of owe you an ( lowers her voice,
BASH: Last week ful ) when you drove me home, I Oh, don't worry about it. It was a big misunderstanding.
RICK: Oh, don't worry about it. It was a big misunderstanding.
PAIGE: No, it wasn't. She takes a moment, looks around.
RICK: Yeah. Um.I have to go, Paige, but it was great seeing you. Paige grabs Rick's arm as he tries to go. She looks suddenly Are you serious? You're doing this again. even with a hall pass?
PAIGE: Are you serious? You're doing this again. even with a hall pass?
RICK: Paige, you're my kids' babysitter. Have a happy birthday. As Rick walks away, we go BACK ON COAKLEY AND FRED as Rick arrives with the champagne.
COAKLEY: Here we go, bubbles doth floweth.
FRED: Holy crap. look who's here. The guys turn to see the coffee girl, Leigh, walking past with two of her GIRLFRIENDS. She sees them and LIGHTS UP.
LEIGH: Hey, Rick! What happened yesterday I thought we were gonna grab a Fred looks at Rick, confused.
RICK: ( SHEEPISH )
LEIGH: Nah, I've never been here, but a friend of mine's DJ-ing tonight so I promised him I'd come. Just then Wannabe from the coffee shop swoo s in and gives Leigh a kiss on the cheek. He has a pair of headphones hanging around his neck.
WANNABE: Wassup, girl?
RICK: Actually, I work for Sirius XM Radiowe're looking to hire some new deejays so I'm checking out all the clubs. Wannabe stiffens, suddenly respectful.
WANNABE: Oh. Cool. Are you serious?
RICK: Leigh is amused by this, but she tries to hide it from the deflated Wannabe.
WANNABE: ( ANNOYED )
FRED: ( GLARING )
RICK: ( GUILTY )
FRED: What gym do you belong to and where the hell was I?
COAKLEY: Well, according to Kimmy Long, you were at the massage parlor trying to get a rub-and-tug without filling out the paperwork. This takes the wind out of Fred's sails.
RICK: Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick glares at Fred.
FRED: I had a knot in my neckwhy the hell didn't you tell me you saw Coffee Girl?!
COAKLEY: Okay, guys, cut the crap. We're all here for the same thing. And I'll give you a hint what that thing is: It begins with a 'P' and ends with an 'ussy.' Coakley puts his arm around Fred.
FRED: Coakley spots something.
COAKLEY: Oohthere's a couple of trainwrecks. Let's go.
FRED: ( ALARMED )
COAKLEY: Ladies, this is my friend Fred Pinkberryhis yogurt company just went public and he's out celebrating. He'd like to offer you a flute of champagne. The Chubby Blondes PERK UP.
RICK: So.. .having a good time?
LEIGH: Me too. Just chillin' and wigglin'. LONG BEAT as they dance. Then:
RICK: Me too. Just chillin' and wigglin'. LONG BEAT as they dance. Then:
LEIGH: ( TEASING )
RICK: Oh yeah? Just try to keep up. She smiles at this, then Coakley DANCES UP BESIDE RICK and
COAKLEY: Abort! Abort! You stand not a No, no, I think we're starting to Coakley rolls his eyes.
RICK: No, no, I think we're starting to Coakley rolls his eyes.
COAKLEY: No, no, you're mistaken. Look, dude, this ain't Operation Cock- block herenow trust me, retreat. Rick glances back at Leigh, torn. She looks fantastic.
RICK: Coak, I'm never gonna have another hall pass, so this memory has to last a lifetime. . .you know what I Coakley looks at Leigh and SIGHS.
COAKLEY: All right, I'll be at the bar when this thing blows up in your face. As Rick dances back over to Leigh, we. PAN ACROSS THE ROOM to the PISSED-OFF Wannabe watching them from the deejay booth.
WANNABE: ( INTO MIC )
RICK: Is this guy your boyfriend or No, no, no. She waves it off, then shrugs guiltily.
LEIGH: No, no, no. She waves it off, then shrugs guiltily.
RICK: And what does 'messed around a little' mean these days?
LEIGH: Rick tries hard to act nonchalant.
RICK: ( CALLING BACK )
MAGGIE: Oh. Hey. She goes to the screen door.
RICK COLEMAN: Thought you might want to help me celebrate the end of the season. He holds up a grocery bag.
FRED: ( DEADPAN )
FRED: Oh my god! You're here! Fred jumps off the bed and gives Missy a hug.
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: ( CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE )
FRED: Never felt better. Missy nods.
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: I have to say, I can't believe I'm actually hereI was on my way home from dinner when I noticed your text. So what's this big emergency?
FRED: Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. By 'emergency' I just meant that there's some important stuff I want to talk to you about. You know, one on one, me and youwithout all the husbands and wives and hoopla. So how are I'm. good.
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: I'm. good.
FRED: No, I mean how-are-you. Inside. What's happenin' in there? There must be all sorts of emotions churning up with the divorce and She gives him a long look.
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: Maybe we should go somewhere else this doesn't seem like the best place to spill one's guts. Just then, Coakley swoops in and pulls Fred aside.
COAKLEY: ( UNDER BREATH )
FRED: But.I know her. She said she wants to leave with me.
COAKLEY: Then she's insanerun for the Coak, the woman's going through a divorce. She's not insane, she's just making really poor decisions right now. ( hands him his car keys ) Here, give Rick the keys to my mini- van. I'm gonna go back to the hotel with Missy. Coakley looks back at Missy and softens.
FRED: Coak, the woman's going through a divorce. She's not insane, she's just making really poor decisions right now. ( hands him his car keys ) Here, give Rick the keys to my mini- van. I'm gonna go back to the hotel with Missy. Coakley looks back at Missy and softens.
COAKLEY: It's your funeral, princess. BACK ON RICK AND LEIGH dancing up a storm. Rick is OUT OF BREATH and SWEATING LIKE A PIG. His shirt is soaked and his hair is dripping wet.
LEIGH: Are you okayyou keep checking your pulse?
RICK: Nah, I'm fine. I had a little chest cramp during the last song, but I worked through it. She smiles at this.
LEIGH: Come on, let's sit this one out. I need a breather. They move to the bar and Rick starts DRYING HIMSELF with a stack of cocktail napkins.
RICK: Um.have you ever heard of a hall EXT. BALL TEAM BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT Grace pulls up in her Camry and gets out. She hears MUSIC coming from inside and hesitates a BEAT before walking nervously onto the porch and KNOCKING. A moment later Gerry appears in the doorway.
GERRY: There she is! Come on in, I'm mixing up some margaronis. We lost our final game, but I got four Oh. Great. Uh, where is everyone?
GRACE: Oh. Great. Uh, where is everyone?
GERRY: They all went out to partynow get in here! But Grace stays on the porch.
GRACE: Gerry, I'm sorry but I can't stay.
GERRY: Grace hasn't been in this situation in a long time and it shows. Gerry steps out onto the porch looking concerned.
GRACE: Yeah, yeah, everything's fine, ( holds up gift box ) .I can't accept this.
GERRY: Why not? Grace does a double-take.
GRACE: Gerry, I'm a married woman. Gerry nods at this, maybe a little hurt. She hands him the box and he reluctantly accepts it.
GERRY: Um. I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, Grace. It's just that.I really like you.
GRACE: I like you, too, Gerry, and you didn't make me uncomfortable. She smiles at him and he forces a smile back, and there's some serious eye-contact, and then BAM! They DIVE AT EACH OTHER and start SUCKING FACE LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW. As they continue to MAUL EACH OTHER, they STUMBLE INTO THE HOUSE, and we
LEIGH: So.you're married?
RICK: I wasn't deliberately hiding it. He holds up his ring hand.
LEIGH: Yeah, I just thought your wife had died or something and you were wearing it out of respect.
RICK: ( UNCOMFORTABLE )
COAKLEY: Come on, you're not gonna close the sale herelet's move this clambake back to my place.
RICK: Okay, but what am I gonna do there?
COAKLEY: What do you mean, what are you gonna do? I've got a house with bedroomsdo the math. When it doesn't work out with herwhich it won'tthere's going to be a bunch of other back-up chicks there. Rick nods then turns to Leigh.
RICK: My buddy's inviting everybody back to his crib.
LEIGH: Sounds cool. As they walk toward the exit, we
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: I've got to be honest, Fred. I'm not really sure what we're doing What do you mean? We're hangin', we're connectingthat's what friends do. Especially if they want to take it to the next level where they can call each other 'good He comes to his room and starts to unlock the door.

MISSY FRANKENFIELD: You're married, Fred.
FRED: Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Fred opens the door but Missy stays in the hall.
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: What does blah-blah mean? You are still married, right?
FRED: Happily. Look, I don't want to get into all the details, but my wife gave me this one-time deal where I get to be with another woman. He opens the door wide. She looks at him for a BEAT.
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: I thought we were going to the hotel bar?
FRED: We are. There's a mini-bar in my room. You better hurry up, it's last call. Fred smiles.
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: Are you out of your flippin' mind? Fred loses the smile.
FRED: MISSY FRANKENFIELD
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: Are you out of your mind?!
FRED: I'm going to be honest with you your tone right now is scaring me.
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: You call me up for the first time in your life, claim you have some kind of emergency, and it turns out that you just want to screw me?!
FRED: Or not.
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: Well, screw you, Fred! She starts walking down the hallway. Fred nods, unfazed.
FRED: Nail on the head! She turns and glares at him.
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: What you just saidI had that coming. Big time. Fred hangs his head.
FRED: What you just saidI had that coming. Big time. Fred hangs his head.
( SIGHS: Anyway ease forgive me. I really am very, very sorry and Missy, standing a few feet away, finally calms down.
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: Okay. Whatever.
FRED: Thank you.
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: Fuck you, Fred! Missy STORMS away.
FRED: ( TO SELF )
FRED: Hi. May I help you? REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS Paige's Aunt Meg. She's wearing a skirt and low-cut tank top and has cougar written all over Rick, my name's Meg. I'm your babysitter Paige's aunt, and I just wanted to come over here and tell you this: They don't make men like you anymore. She smiles.
AUNT MEG: Rick, my name's Meg. I'm your babysitter Paige's aunt, and I just wanted to come over here and tell you this: They don't make men like you anymore. She smiles.
FRED: Oh. Well, thank you.
GERRY: Everything okay?
GRACE: Yeah. Yeah. It's just .no, everything's not okay.
GERRY: He moves close to her and she grows uncomfortable.
GRACE: Look, you're a great cguy, Gerry, and you're very charming and very sweet and the last thing I wanted to do was hurt your feelings, but.well, what,just happened can never happen again. Gerry looks confused.
GERRY: I know it's probably hard for you to understand but.I love my So? What does that have to do with anything? Fate threw us together and we went with itisn't that what life's all about?
GRACE: I know it's probably hard for you to understand but.I love my So? What does that have to do with anything? Fate threw us together and we went with itisn't that what life's all about?
GERRY: So? What does that have to do with anything? Fate threw us together and we went with itisn't that what life's all about?
GRACE: Not always.
GERRY: I know that.
GRACE: You do?
GERRY: ( BIG SMILE )
GRACE: I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm just saying, I didn't think we were going to start dating, you know? Could you imagine the looks we'd get? It'd be like Hugh Hefner and his girlfriendsexcept in reverse. Gerry CHUCKLES.
GERRY: I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm just saying, I didn't think we were going to start dating, you know? Could you imagine the looks we'd get? It'd be like Hugh Hefner and his girlfriendsexcept in reverse. Gerry CHUCKLES.
GRACE: Yeah, I got that part. Gerry looks at his watch.
GERRY: Ooh, I gotta get going. We have kind of a team meeting in like twenty minutes. Gerry sees Grace glance at the clock: 12:15 A.M.
GERRY CONT'D: It's, uh, kind o a tradition that we always get together on the night of the last game. It would probably be uncool if I missed it.
GRACE: You don't have to explain.
GERRY: Seriously, though, thanks for everythingthat was awesome. He holds up his hand and she diligently HIGH-FIVES HIM. Then Gerry WALKS OUT THE DOOR. Grace sits there alone for a moment. We PUSH IN ON HER and we hear Gerry's CAR START OUTSIDE, and when Grace STARTS TO CRY, we
LEIGH: I guess I still have a lot to get out of my system before I do the marriage trip. I'm one of those people who wants to try everything once before I die.
RICK: ( BLURTING OUT )
LEIGH: Neither have I. Rick winces, but Leigh smiles at him. It's the moment of I'd like to help you take being with a married guy off your list of things to do before you die.
RICK: Neither have I. Rick winces, but Leigh smiles at him. It's the moment of I'd like to help you take being with a married guy off your list of things to do before you die.
LEIGH: You would?
RICK: Leigh gets close.
LEIGH: I don't want to be a home-wrecker.
RICK: I've got a one-time pass, remember?
LEIGH: That wasn't just a line?
RICK: No. It's for real. Leigh seems intrigued. She moves closer still, takes his So where can we go to talk some more about this?
LEIGH: So where can we go to talk some more about this?
RICK: ( NERVOUS )
LEIGH: Can you give me a second?
RICK: Wannabe and Leigh walk a few feet away and Rick watches them have an ANIMATED CONVERSATION. It appears Wannabe may even be crying. Finally, Wannabe storms across the room but when he gets to the door, he looks back at Leigh.
WANNABE: Well? Are you coming? Leigh SIGHS, then approaches Rick.
LEIGH: I'm sorry, Rick. I have to go deal with this. Rick can't believe what's happening.
RICK: Really? Now? I thought you said he wasn't your boyfriend.
LEIGH: He's not.but he is a friend. Leigh glances at the broken-down Wannabe standing there at the door, then turns back to Rick.
MAGGIE: .And he hasn't even spent one night in his own bed this week.
RICK COLEMAN: Let me get this straightyou gave him his freedom and now you're mad that he's acting free? This logic clearly stings Maggie.
MAGGIE: I called his assistanthe's been in the office almost everyday.
RICK COLEMAN: Look, Maggie, for all you know your husband's been working at a sou kitchen, sleeping in his car al week, and he's only gotten laid two or three times at most. She looks up and forces a smile.
MAGGIE: Maggie checks her watch.
RICK COLEMAN: Well, if she went over to break the kid's heart, the least she could do is lend a sympathetic ear. He flips a pancake onto a plate.
MAGGIE: Oh My-lanta.
RICK COLEMAN: And to wash it all down. Rick reaches into the bag and pulls out a DESSERT WINE. Off Maggie's smile, we
RICK: Hey. . .what are you guys doing here?
RICK: Really? I thought you guys had given up on us?
BAKER: We did. We're here with them. He nods toward RICK LEARY and WILLY BOSHANE, both early 40's and paunchy.
RICK: What are you talking about?
BAKER: When Leary and Boshane heard about your guy's hall pass, they convinced their wives to give them one, too. A smiling Leary tries to HIGH-FIVE Rick, but he's having none of it. He turns to Baker, livid.
RICK: You weren't supposed to tell anyone about the hall pass!
LEARY: They didn't say anything. Our wives heard about it at the pool.
RICK: No! At the pool?! Rick rubs his face, distressed.
BOSHANE: Yep. And then about three days ago after some hard-core negotiating we managed to push the bill The guys LAUGH. Rick can hardly believe what he's spawned.
RICK: Really? So.how's it going?
BOSHANE: Solid. Very solid.
LEARY: We're building mucho momentumo. Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION.
BOSHANE: That's right. It's about going bowling and, uh, staying up late, and being able to do what you want to do when you want to do it.
RICK: Haven't gotten laid yet, huh?
BOSHANE: ( DISPIRITED )
GARY: Hey, dudes, there's like ten very bangable chicks out on the back decklet's go! Leary HOLDS UP HIS BEER.
LEARY: To freedom! The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back deck. A dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns and pushes his way through the crowd to the front door. As he OPENS THE DOOR to leave, he finds himself FACE-TO-FACE WITH
LEIGH: Hey, where are you going?
RICK: What are you doing.? I thought you'd left.
LEIGH: No. I told you, I just had to talk him off the ledge. I calmed him down and sent him on his way.
RICK: Oh. Uh, great.
LEIGH: So where's that game room? I thought we were gonna play some She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go.
LEIGH: I'll be right backI just have to use the bathroom. Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears into the bathroom. He takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it. Just then he hears O.S. LAUGHTER. Rick heads down the hallway and pushes open a door.
RICK: Hey. How come you're not downstairs Coakley gives him a sad, worn-out smile.
COAKLEY: All partied out, pal. Rick nods, understanding. Coakley LAUGHS once again at the
RICK: How's that?
COAKLEY: Well think about it. There's two kinds of guys who cheat on their wives: The guy who does it behind her back, and a guy like you who has his wife's permission.
RICK: Well it's not really cheating if I have permission.
COAKLEY: Yeah, whatever. The point is, if you asked a hundred people who the better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em would pick you, because you're being honestthere's no deceit Rick is growing uncomfortable.
RICK: Well I didn't really think of it
LIKE: It's like she's your guilt Sherpa! Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates.
COAKLEY: It's like she's your guilt Sherpa! Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates.
RICK: ( WEAKLY )
COAKLEY: And that, my friend, is why you are a genius. As Rick lets this all sink in, we
FRED: They CLINK glasses.
AUNT MEG: Rick, I hope you don't mind me tracking you downPaige told me where you were staying.
FRED: Please. Not at all.
AUNT MEG: You've been very sweet to her. Fred waves her off.
FRED: Hey, she's a good kid. I do what I can for the kids. Aunt Meg moves in a little closer, squints at him sweetly.
AUNT MEG: She told me everything. And I have to say, I was very impressed.
FRED: AUNT MEG
AUNT MEG: I know she tried to hook-up with youtwice in factand that you set her straight both times. Fred hadn't heard this from Rick and is a little confused.
FRED: AUNT MEG ( SMILES )
AUNT MEG: ( SMILES )
FRED: Well. she's a kid and kids get crushes. I remember in tenth grade I had the biggest crush on my French teacherthank God Mr. LeClaire was professional enough to only date seniors. Meg GIGGLES.
AUNT MEG: I'm serious, it takes a certain kind of guy to say no to a beautiful young girl like that especially since you have your wi e's permission now. Meg shoots him a knowing smile and puts her glass down.
FRED: Hey, all you have in this world is your word. As Aunt Meg CLIMBS ON TOP OF FRED, we
RICK: Leigh, I gotta split.
LEIGH: ( NERVOUS )
RICK: ( NERVOUS )
LEIGH: Really? Are you feeling okay? You're not mad because I went outside with my friend, are you?
RICK: No, no, no. Look, I shouldn't be doing this. I have.. .you know, Leigh nods at this, then unties a shoulder strap and her DRESS FALLS TO THE FLOOR. Suddenly she's NAKED before him and she's PERFECT.
LEIGH: Relax. Don't think so much. You're gonna have your wife for the rest of your life, but tonight. . .you have me. Leigh smiles. And it's the kind of smile you only get two or three times in your life, if you're lucky, and probably never from a woman this beautiful. She reaches down and UNBUCKLES HIS PANTS, then she PULLS OFF HIS SHIRT. They stand face-to-face now, the middle-aged guy and the young beauty, and it's happening exactly the way Rick had hoped it would, the dream. She presses her body against his and STARTS TO KISS HIS NECK, her hand DISAPPEARING SOMEWHERE BELOW HIS WAIST. Then she leans her head AGAINST HIS CHEST. As he looks down at her, we PUSH IN on a suddenly conflicted Rick.
RICK: Nope. I can't do this. He reaches for his shirt.
LEIGH: What are you doing?
RICK: I'm sorry. She stares at him, confused, as he buckles his pants.
LEIGH: Your wife didn't give you a hallway permission slip, did she?
RICK: Yes, she did, but. look, you're insanely beautiful and pathologically sexy and every cell in my body is telling me to dust do this, but Rick points to his chest.
LEIGH: Well, I think you have a screw loose and you're probably going to regret this for the rest of your life, but. . .right on, man.
RICK: Um.do you want me to give you a ride home?
LEIGH: No. It's only one-thirtyI'm going back down to the party. Rick raises two fingers.
RICK: Peace it.
LEIGH: R-O-C-K in the U-S-A. As they smile at each other one last time, we
RICK: MAN'S VOICE ( V.0. ) Yes, is this Fred Searing?
RICK: Oh, uh, no, I'm sorry, he's not here right now. I'm using his car.
AUNT MEG: I'm attracted to men with Thankswow, you got great jugs. Meg takes Fred's hand and leads him toward the bed ( with his pants still at his ankles ), Fred WADDLING LIKE A PENGUIN.
FRED: Thankswow, you got great jugs. Meg takes Fred's hand and leads him toward the bed ( with his pants still at his ankles ), Fred WADDLING LIKE A PENGUIN.
AUNT MEG: Moral-guy's a tit-man, huh?
FRED: ( SHRUGGING )
AUNT MEG: Oh yes! Rick. please.I want you to make love to me. Just then Rick BURSTS INTO THE ROOM, out of breath. Fred and Meg come up from under the covers. ( Fred is at waist-level on her. )
RICK: Fred, I need to talk to you! Meg GLARES down at Fred, confused.
AUNT MEG: Fred? I thought you were Rick?!
RICK: I'm Rick. Fred cowers guiltily.
FRED: Please don't judge me. As Aunt Meg KARATE KICKS Fred in the face, we
FRED: What did they tell you? Is Grace gonna be okay?
RICK: All I know is she was in a car accident and they rushed her to the Oh my God. Suddenly they hear O.S. GLASS SHATTERING. They look up and
FRED: Oh my God. Suddenly they hear O.S. GLASS SHATTERING. They look up and
WANNABE: How do you like me now, Splenda- You moron, that's Lny car! His is the one next to it! Wannabe looks over at Rick's Avalon, PULLS OUT A KNIFE, and quickly SLASHES TWO OF RICK'S TIRES. As Rick and Fred RUN TOWARD HIM, Wannabe JUMPS INTO AN OLD BRONCO and PEELS OUT OF

FRED: What was I thinking?! I had a great wifea beautiful wifeand now I may lose her.. .because of you.

RICK COLEMAN: Something's wrong with a guy who would leave a woman like you alone for this long.
MAGGIE: ( UNCOMFORTABLE )
RICK COLEMAN: So what? If you were my girl, I wouldn't have taken it. An awkward moment. Rick touches her hand and Maggie looks RICK COLEMAN ( CONT'D ) You deserve way better.
MAGGIE: Uh, in Rick's defense, he didn't really even want the hall pass. I kind of forced it on him.
RICK COLEMAN: Why would you do that? Maggie thinks about this.
MAGGIE: I don't know.
RICK COLEMAN: This hall pass .it wasn't for him.
MAGGIE: This hall pass .it wasn't for him.

DOCTOR: Are you the husband of. ( glances down at chart ) .Grace Searing? Fred strains to look up.

BURLY OFFICER: All right, let him up. The young officers get off Fred and help him up. Fred rushes to the Doctor, who seems very serious.
