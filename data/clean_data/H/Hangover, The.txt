THE HANGOVER: Written by
MR. TURNER: Any word from Doug?
TRACY: No, but I'm sure he's
VICK LENNON: He's in his late 20's, tall, rugged and currently a mess. His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent, his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days.
VICK: Tracy, it's Vick.
TRACY: Hey Vick!
VICK: Listen, honey.The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well.we lost Doug.
TRACY: ( her jaw dropping ) What?! But we're getting married in like four hours!
VICK: Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
STU: Dude this is already the best weekend ever!
VICK: Stu, relax, we're still on the 10.
STU: Oh, did I show you pictures of my No, dude, show `em.
DOUG: No, dude, show `em.
STU: Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is already four! Can you believe it?!
DOUG: ( smiling at photos ) How cute. Good for you, man.
VICK: The one on the left is gonna be a hottie. The other one, not so much.
STU: Jesus, dude, those are my children
ALAN: ( re: sunscreen ) Hey, am I rubbed in?
STU: Yeah, you're good.
DOUG: Hey so Alan, are you and Becky still together?
VICK: Of course they are, Doug. Jesus, Alan's been dating Becky for 14 years. When they first met, Alan had braces and soccer hair, and Becky had a functioning hymen.
DOUG: She still pressuring you to get Enh, we've moved past the pressure stage.it's more like aggravated assault stage now? Like at the last wedding we went to, she threw a camera at my head, called me a closet fag, then ran out crying.
ALAN: Enh, we've moved past the pressure stage.it's more like aggravated assault stage now? Like at the last wedding we went to, she threw a camera at my head, called me a closet fag, then ran out crying.
STU: Maybe you could wear a helmet to Doug's wedding.
ALAN: Great idea, Stu. Thanks.
DOUG: ( LAUGHING ) So Vick, how's business going?
VICK: Oh, great. Yeah, I'm working on bringing the next big dessert craze to Los Angeles. It's gonna be huge.
DOUG: What is it?
VICK: Bavarian custard. We ran the numbers, and it's gonna be bigger than fro yo.
ALAN: Isn't custard like a trillion Our plan is to open three stores in the Valley and then franchise it. Shares are selling fast, but I can probably squeeze you guys in.
VICK: Our plan is to open three stores in the Valley and then franchise it. Shares are selling fast, but I can probably squeeze you guys in.
DOUG: Yeah, man, count me in.
STU: Me too, man! I love pudding!
ALAN: Is this gonna do better than the hip-hop label you started, Vick? Or the topless sushi bar? Or the mobile tattoo parlor?
VICK: Tattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of it's time, Alan! And don't come crying to me when there's a Custard Cabana on every street corner in America and you didn't buy in!
DOUG: ( LAUGHING ) All right, all right, save it for the party.
STU: Dude! I can't believe I get to party all night, and then, tomorrow .I get to sleep in! It's almost too much! And FYI, if anyone gets really drunk and craps themself, just let me know, I can have you cleaned up and partying again in under three minutes. No joke. I am a master of stool removal.
VICK: Checking in. Lennon comma Victor.
VICK: Hold it right there, Atashir. This is my best friend from childhood, Douglas Billings. In two days, he is to marry a woman of great beauty and strong teeth, do you understand? A woman of gigantic bosoms who will give him many, many
ATASHIR: No, sir.
VICK: Well, then. I think one of us needs to get back on his little computer and find us a suitable room.
ATASHIR: All the deluxe rooms are taken. The Dean Martin suite is available, but I'd have to ask my
VICK: Dean-o will be fine. Send up a case of Cristal, two bottles of Patron, four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of skinless mangos.
ATASHIR: And how would you like to pay?
VICK: American Express.
ALAN: Don't worry, we'll hit you later.
VICK: Don't worry, we'll hit you later.
STU: This is bigger than my house.
VICK: Get dressed, ladies. We're wheels up in ten.
ALAN: I am so not getting paid back.
VICK: This is Vick.
ALAN: So, you ready for Sunday?
DOUG: Yeah. I thought I'd be nervous, but I'm actually just really psyched.
ALAN: Tracy's dad still hate you?
DOUG: Oh yeah.
ALAN: Any closer to figuring out why?
DOUG: Enh, I think he wanted more for his girl. I mean, I'm a teacher who makes 45 grand a year, and he's a titan of industry who makes 45 grand a day, you know? I sort of get it. Also, I'm banging his daughter. I'm not sure you ever get past that.
ALAN: Ahhh yeah, I wasn't going to tell anyone about that
STU: Anyone got any nipple lube? Jesus would you look at the size of that thing?!
DOUG: It's Alan's. For Becky.
STU: Jesus, who made this thing? Diddy?
ALAN: ( clutching for ring ) Actually, I-I was trying to keep it a secret, so
VICK: Boy Party in the bathrooooom! Miner's cut, 2.6 Carats, slight pink tint, street value: 26, 27K.
STU: Dude, it's for Becky! Alan's finally going to propose!
VICK: Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good for you! Where'd you get the ring?
ALAN: Oh, it's a family heirloom. My grandmother smuggled it through the Holocaust, actually. I was going to propose to Beck this weekend.
DOUG: Well: now we have two things to
STU: Thish is so great! I love you guys!
VICK: Check it out, Stu's already wasted.
ALAN: We've only had two shots, man!
DOUG: Yeah, what happened, Stuey?! You used to be able to drink us all under the table!
STU: Dude, I'm a dad! I don't have time to get plastered anymore! It blows!
DOUG: What? No!
STU: Because my dad was a bad dad.
DOUG: ( patting his shoulder ) That's true, Stuey, but you're different. We've talked about this.
STU: Have I showed you guys pictures of my kids yet?
YES!: Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt:
DOUG: Little toast: to Tracy, the coolest, kindest, most beautiful woman I've ever met. I can't believe she let me come this weekend much less agreed to spend the rest of her life with me. I think both will prove to be massive errors of judgement on her
DOUG: I'm serious, dudes! Nothing above the neck no piercings, no weird haircuts, no facial tattoos. I gotta look decent on Sunday.
VICK: Jesus, what do you take us for?
DOUG: Vick: you shaved Alan's eyebrows off the night before graduation!
STU: Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And remember when I blacked out at Homecoming and you wrote on my face with permanent marker?! That was awesome! What'd you write again?
STU: Ahh, good times, man. Good times.
VICK: We'll be good tonight, Doug.
ALAN: Seriously, man, we're your friends.
STU: Yeah, we've totally grown up since
DOUG: Well then.to a night we'll never
VICK: Damn, dude, why are you retarded?
STU: Why do you have a mullet?
VICK: Why do you have a mullet?
STU: You know, business on top, party down the back?
VICK: You know, business on top, party down the back?
VICK: Get him up. I'm hungry.
VICK: Jesus, dude, put away your sack.
STU: Yeah, and it might be time for some manscaping, bro. Your bush looks like Yanni.
ALAN: What did we do last night?
STU: Dude, why is my ass killing me.?
MAN: We'll.we'll get the next one.
VICK: We might not smell very good.
STU: This might be the worst hangover anyone has ever had, ever.
ALAN: I can't taste anything.
VICK: Please stop talking. If I don't focus on eating I'm going to throw up all over myself.
ALAN: Hey. Are we missing something?
STU: Yes: I left my hat in the room thank you, Alan.
ALAN: No. That's not it. There's something else.
VICK: You gonna finish that cruller?
ALAN: Doug. Guys, where's Doug?
STU: Yeah. He's not here.
VICK: Probably left him in the room.
STU: Good morning, this is Stu?
VICK: It's me, meatdick.
STU: ( to Alan, concerned ) It's Vick
ALAN: You calling the room?
VICK: No answer.
ALAN: Ummm.shouldn't we look for him? Check-out is in like ten minutes.
STU: Yeah, and we told Tracy we'd have Doug back to LA by five.
VICK: I'm eabing.
ALAN: What an asshole. Stu, check the pool and the casino, I'll check the room and the gym. Maybe he's working out or something.
VICK: HE'S FIME! YOU'RE OBERWEACTING!
ALAN: Doug.? Doug.? Wake up, man.
ALAN: That's weird.
STU: No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's totally cool.
ALAN: I hate you all.
STU: DOUG! DOUG!
DOUG! DOUG!: Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands.
GAY MAN: Hey Stu.
STU: Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG!
STU: You find Doug?
ALAN: No, I assume you didn't either?
ATASHIR: There is no Doug Billings at any of the area hospitals, morgues, or police stations.
STU: Maybe he went for a jog?
ALAN: Dude. It's 120 degrees outside.
STU: Or shopping?
ALAN: Great. So we've officially lost Doug. His wedding is in what, 22 Relax, it's Doug, he's probably crashed out on someone's couch right now. All we have to do is retrace our steps from last night, and we'll find him.
VICK: Relax, it's Doug, he's probably crashed out on someone's couch right now. All we have to do is retrace our steps from last night, and we'll find him.
ALAN: Okay, so last night.
VICK: Well, we started on the roof.
ALAN: Right, that was like, 6ish.?
VICK: Then.I think.we had steaks at the Palm?
ALAN: Yeah. Then.we played craps at the Hard Rock.maybe?
VICK: That sounds right.
STU: Okay, honestly? I don't even remember going to dinner.
VICK: I vaguely recall.doing body shots ..at some point? Is that.maybe?
ALAN: I'm pretty much blank after The Hard Rock.
VICK: I think we went to the Flamingo after that.? And then, I just remember a lot of blue light.and the overpowering smell of baby oil.
ALAN: So that was what, 10ish?
VICK: Give or take.
STU: Was Doug still with us?
VICK: Yes. Yes. Doug was with us. I tackled him.for some reason.
ALAN: Okay. So we only have a 13 hour window where we could've lost him.
STU: Hey! Look, we were at the Flamingo.
ALAN: ATM receipt from the Rio at 10:37 For 600 dollars?!
VICK: The valet ticket says we returned here at 4:57AM.
STU: We drove last night?
ALAN: Here's a receipt from Sbarro. The meal was comped for some reason
VICK: Why do we have a matchbook from The Golden Pony All Male Revue?
ALAN: Someone could've given that to us.
STU: ( laughing, nervous ) Yeah, totally! There's no way we went there! We're not gay! Hahaha!
ALAN: I think we should call Tracy.
VICK: Absolutely not.
ALAN: What if Doug called her? She might know where he is.
STU: Yeah, I'm with Alan on this one.
VICK: Of course you're with Alan, you're both gutless cowards. But we're not calling Tracy. You never call the bride from the bachelor party. Ever. If my balls were on fire and Tracy was sitting next door with a tall glass of water, I still wouldn't call her. It's a rule.
ALAN: But shouldn't we at least tell her we're gonna be getting home late?
VICK: She has a watch, she'll figure it I think I'm beginning to see why you're always single.
ALAN: I think I'm beginning to see why you're always single.
VICK: And I think I'm beginning to see why you're always a douche
STU: ( clutching his ass ) Guys, wait. I need your help oh my God like right now. Come on.
ALAN: Jesus, what is it?
VICK: I can't believe we're doing this.
STU: You don't have to look up my butt, just at it. Something is terribly, terribly wrong.
ALAN: Sweet mother of mercy.
VICK: Who's Roger?
STU: I-I-I don't know?! What do you think it means?!
VICK: What do I think it means? Well, Stuart, your ass is all torn up and you're wearing thong underwear declaring your love for another dude I don't think we need the CSI team for this one! You got reamed last night, man!
ALAN: I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for this.
STU: Really?! What?!
ALAN: Yeah, maybe there isn't.
VICK: Look, I'm sure Roger is a very nice, considerate young man
STU: Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?!
VICK: Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near cool enough.
STU: ( gasping, realizing ) I do watch Dancing With The Stars with the kids!
ALAN: Oh god, that doesn't mean you're But sort of.it does?
VICK: But sort of.it does?
STU: And once, I caught myself gazing at a topless photo of David Beckham!
ALAN: So what, he's a great-looking dude
STU: And then I had those weird feelings for Vick that time in middle school, remember?!
VICK: Um, what?
STU: Yeah, that weekend we were all camping I told you this.
VICK: Yeah, no you didn't.
STU: I didn't?
VICK: I think I'd remember, dude.
ALAN: Yeah, I think we'd all remember.
STU: Yeah. I had weird feelings for you that weekend. Like really hot, really gay feelings. But then they went away.
ALAN: Wait I was there that weekend. Did you have gay feelings for me?
VICK: What?! I was a good-looking kid!
ALAN: What?! I was a good-looking kid!
VICK: Please, you're so not his type!
STU: Wait, what?
VICK: Look, Stu, one homosexual experience doesn't mean you're permanently gay, okay? A lot of guys test the waters.
ALAN: All right, we're scaring the children. Let's go.
STU: Wait so have either of you tested the waters?
VICK: No! We're not gay!
STU: How am I going to tell my wife?
VICK: Quickly, and from a great distance.
STU: Jesus, what kind of father am I?
ALAN: Oh my God.
STU: ( really scared ) You think Erin will try to take the ( turning, annoyed ) What now?
ALAN: ( turning, annoyed ) What now?
VICK: ( turning, annoyed ) What now?
STU: ( not getting it ) Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna have a field day with this.
VICK: Oh my God. Oh my God.
STU: What's the big? Oh! OH! OH!
ALAN: ( reading inscription ) "To My Noble Husband, Alan."
STU: This is worse than my underwear!
VICK: They guys exchange a look.
VICK: So, we go to the wedding chapel, we find out what we did with Doug, we recover him, and we're back in LA before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass.
STU: Check it out, some idiot threw his bed out the window last night.
ALAN: That was us, dude.
STU: Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good reason for doing it.
ALAN: Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good reason for doing it.
STU: ( FROWNING ) Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good reason for doing it.
ALAN: Yeah, Stu, I really do.
VICK: Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be
STU: You okay, Vick?
VICK: I'm not emotionally prepared to talk about it just yet, Stuart, but thank you.
ALAN: Seriously: what am I gonna tell Becky? For 14 years she's been begging me to get married.
VICK: Well, now you did. Just not to her.
ALAN: Wait, is that homeless guy wearing Doug's shirt?
STU: Yeah, that was a different shirt.
VICK: Yeah, that was a different shirt.
ALAN: What if they don't remember us?
AAAAYYYYY!: The guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, STEVE GIANOPOLUS, 40's, in a tight white suit, his arms spread wide. Steve is all Vegas, by way of Long Island.
STEVE: How are you, you dumb bastards?!
VICK: Does the pope wear a funny hat?! Let's do this thing!
STEVE: And where is Chastity today?
ALAN: ( LAUGHING ) Your wife, man! AWW, you're just breaking my balls!
STEVE: ( LAUGHING ) Your wife, man! AWW, you're just breaking my balls!
VICK: Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony, wasn't it?
STEVE: Hand to God, I've never seen two people more in love!
VICK: Sadly, I believe you.
ALAN: I am never.ever.drinking again.
STU: Jesus, she is stacked.
VICK: Stu, please, show some class. That's Alan's wife you're talking Sorry. She looks really nice.
STU: ( to Alan, guilty ) Sorry. She looks really nice.
ALAN: We got a unicorn?!
STEVE: Oh, yeah, you got the entire Double Camelot Package.
ALAN: A-And how much did that cost?
STEVE: 7 thousand dollars.
ALAN: I'm gonna kill you!
VICK: ( fending him off ) You can't put a pricetag on love, Alan! OW! You just can't!
CARLA: Ahhh! I'm just busting your nuts!
VICK: It's good to be seen, Carla. It's good to be seen.
CARLA: I brought the rest of your package.
STU: No way! Awesome!
STEVE: A hundred DVDs of the ceremony.
VICK: For you and Chastity to watch on your anniversary.
CARLA: The velvet wall hanging.
VICK: And it looks like real velvet, Alan, so no machine wash, okay?
CARLA: And the big finish:
STU: HOLY CRAP! DUDE, YOU HAVE A SHIELD! I want a shield!
HOLY CRAP!: DUDE, YOU HAVE A SHIELD! I want a shield!
VICK: DUDE, YOU HAVE A SHIELD! I want a shield!
STU: I want a shield!
VICK: Me too! Hey, can Stu and I get a I don't suppose you have any sort of return policy, do you?
ALAN: I don't suppose you have any sort of return policy, do you?
STEVE: Um.if you know another couple who looks exactly like you guys, and who want two dozen commuter mugs, a wall hanging, and a shield.sure.
ALAN: We hear someone YELLING AT HIM. Alan's eyes bulge.
VICK: That's his girlfriend of 14 years. I'm sure this'll only take a
BECKY: in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing up her suitcase. She's beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set.
BECKY: Can you tell me why all the goddamn credit cards are maxed out?!
ALAN: No! I-I have no idea!
VICK: HEY ALAN, HOW COME I WASN'T YOUR BEST MAN, DUDE! YEAH, WHAT THE HELL, ME EITHER! WHY'D YOU PICK DOUG?!
STU: YEAH, WHAT THE HELL, ME EITHER! WHY'D YOU PICK DOUG?!
BECKY: "Your best man?!" What's going on there, Alan?!
ALAN: Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS
VICK: HEY ALAN, YOU WANT ALL YOUR WALLET- SIZED WEDDING PHOTOS, OR CAN I BOGART A FEW?!
BECKY: I really don't appreciate being mocked right now, Alan, especially about wedding-related issues. You know how hard this weekend is going to be for me.
ALAN: I know, baby! I know
BECKY: So you'll call the credit card company and straighten this out?
ALAN: Yes. I will. I promise.
BECKY: Okay. Okay. Look, sorry I'm so tense. I'll see you soon, okay? Love you.
ALAN: Yes, no, I love you too!
STU: Hey, how's Becky doing, man?!
VICK: Yeah, did she ask about us?!
STU: Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick found a great clue.
VICK: Turns out Doug was in all the wedding photos, which means if the time stamp was right we had him in our possession until 11 pm.
STU: That's another hour of last night that we can account for. Isn't that Hey, Steve, you don't happen to know where we were heading when we left here last night, do you?
ALAN: ( bitterly sarcastic ) Hey, Steve, you don't happen to know where we were heading when we left here last night, do you?
VICK: Hey, Steve, you don't happen to know where we were heading when we left here last night, do you?
STEVE: Well, the Double Camelot Package comes with a five course wedding feast, so I assume you went there.
STU: Great where was the feast?
STEVE: Sbarro, over in the Fremont mall.
VICK: Your negativity is like a little black cloud over our car, Alan. You've got to let go of this.
ALAN: Let go of what, exactly, Vick?! The fact that I married a complete stranger last night? Or that my girlfriend's about to leave me? Or that I'm broke? Which one?!
VICK: You're broke? I thought you were
LOADED: I know you think it's like terminally uncool to be in a committed relationship, Vick, but I actually love Becky, okay?
ALAN: I know you think it's like terminally uncool to be in a committed relationship, Vick, but I actually love Becky, okay?
VICK: Alan. Honey. Have you considered, even for a second, that maybe the things we do when we're drunk are what we secretly want to do?
ALAN: ( dripping with sarcasm ) Yeah, no, you're absolutely right, Vick, I've always secretly wanted to marry a bottle blonde with big fake melon tits named Chastity!
STU: I ain't mad atcha, dude.
VICK: Or, after 14 years, maybe you don't have the balls to leave Becky, and this is your way of getting her to leave you.
ALAN: I was going to propose to her this weekend, you jackass!
VICK: All the more reason to freak out.
ALAN: I swear to God, Vick, if you say one more word to me, I will destroy Guys, come on, let's not use our angry words
STU: Guys, come on, let's not use our angry words
SMASH!: A baseball bat SHATTERS the windshield! The guys all jump! Vick slams on the brakes!
VICK: What the?!
KALOLO FANALUA: Get out of the car, Vick.
STU: Who are these guys?!
VICK: Stu, please. I think there's been some sort of mistake, Mister.?
KALOLO FANALUA: I'm Mr. Shut The Hell Up And Get The Hell Outta The Car, and this is my associate, Mr. Smash You In The Teeth If You Say Another Word.
VICK: ( beat, to Alan ) Those so aren't their real names.
ALAN: Vick, don't be a dick!
VICK: Alan? Relax. These men aren't going to hurt us. They're from Hawaii.
KALOLO FANALUA: We're from Guam, bitch! Now get outta the car!
VICK: Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat! Jesus, why is everyone trying to kill my car.?
ALAN: Why'd you do that?!
VICK: ( INCREDULOUS ) Maybe they just wanted to talk!
STU: Maybe they just wanted to talk!
VICK: I honestly don't know how you two are still alive.
ALAN: Do you think we stole something from them last night?!
STU: Oh my god I am such a bad dad!
ALAN: ( producing cellphone ) I'm calling the police. This is getting way out of control
VICK: No! No cops!
ALAN: "No cops?!" Who are you, Fitty Yeah, Vick, what's going on?
STU: Yeah, Vick, what's going on?
VICK: Nothing! I just think we should focus on finding Doug and not get distracted by every little thing!
ALAN: Every little thing?! We were just assaulted by the Yakuza!
VICK: Oh please, those guys are from Guam. Get a grip.
ALAN: They knew your name, Vick! Which means they probably know who Stu and I are, too!
STU: If anything ever happened to my family, Vick.
VICK: Fine. Let's just go back to the hotel Doug is probably back from wherever he spent the night, we'll get him, we'll straighten out whatever we did to those angry Samoans, then we'll get the hell back to LA, okay? Left turn.
VICK: Doug? Doug?
ALAN: No messages.
STU: Come on, let's toss the place.
STU: Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested 30 grand in your custard store last
STU: Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?!
VICK: You think she's what those Guamian dudes wanted?
STU: You think she's what those Guamian dudes wanted?
VICK: No. I think she's Alan's wife.
ALAN: What.what am I supposed to do?
STU: Wake her up, man!
ALAN: Why me?!
VICK: Because she's your spouse, dude!
CHASTITY: Dang, did I sleep in the closet
STU: She seems really cool.
VICK: Yeah, I really like her, man.
VICK: So, um, did you take Alan's name?
STU: Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish Listen to me. Just.did we, or did we not, have sex last night?
ALAN: Listen to me. Just.did we, or did we not, have sex last night?
CHASTITY: Alan slumps, his life over. Vick pumps his fist, YES!
VICK: What a responsible, upstanding young Jew. They don't make `em like that anymore, am I right?
CHASTITY: I know he even wanted to use a
ALAN: Wait we didn't use a condom?!
CHASTITY: It's cool, I sponge.
ALAN: Can someone.please open a window?
STU: They don't open.
CHASTITY: So you guys don't remember any of last night?
VICK: Yeah, not so much.
CHASTITY: Hey, been there before, right? Sucks, though. The wedding was really fun. I'm bummed you don't remember it, Alan.
STU: Dude, I think your wife's mad at You don't happen to remember what time we met you last night, do you?
VICK: You don't happen to remember what time we met you last night, do you?
CHASTITY: Sure, we met at the bar at like 10:00? Then we got married on my smoke break, which was like 11:00?
VICK: It's the All-American love story, isn't it? What happened next?
CHASTITY: Well, I had to go back to work. But when I got off at 5:30, I met up with you guys back here.
VICK: And was Doug with us then?
CHASTITY: Interesting. Do you have any idea where we went after the wedding?
VICK: Interesting. Do you have any idea where we went after the wedding?
CHASTITY: No, but I bet some of my work friends do. You were partying with them pretty hard.
STU: Work friends?
STRIPPERS: Dozens of `em, dancing, grinding, shimmying on poles.
ALAN: You work here?
CHASTITY: Yeah and this is the pole where we first met!
ALAN: Look, I don't know how to tell you this, but
CHASTITY: HEY PLATINUM, CHECK IT OUT!
CHASTITY: Come on, let's go meet my
STU: I know.
VICK: I know.
ALAN: The Holocaust, man.
VICK: Look, we can get your grandmother's ring back. We just gotta go about it in the right way.
ALAN: I have besmirched my people.
STU: Don't be so hard on yourself, dude
CHASTITY: These were my bridesmaids, Anastasia and Starr!
STARR: Hey, boys! Good to see you again!
ANASTASIA: Mazel Tov!
ALAN: Just then a SPOTLIGHT finds Chastity and Alan, and the SLEAZY PONYTAILED DJ up in the booth comes over the P.A. system:
CHASTITY: Oh my God, he's playing our song! This song was playing when we met, remember?! You kept sliding twenties into my thong and saying "I will always love you. I will always love you."
ALAN: Yeah, it was so sweet.
CHASTITY: Yeah, it was so sweet.
ALAN: Look, I don't know how to say this, but my friends and I were very drunk last night. We would never come to a place like this
VICK: You are the best bridesmaids ever.
STU: ( huge boobs in his face ) Dude: I might not be gay.
ALAN: What the hell are you doing?!
VICK: Two-for-ones, man.
ALAN: We don't have time for this! We gotta find Doug!
VICK: What do you think we're doing?
ALAN: We're getting into the mindset of last night, to see if it sparks any Now: is this exactly how you were dancing for me last night, Starr?
VICK: We're getting into the mindset of last night, to see if it sparks any Now: is this exactly how you were dancing for me last night, Starr?
ALAN: You are so goddamn selfish, Vick. You really are. Stu, let's go.
VICK: No. Stu, sit and enjoy your dance.
ALAN: Dude: Doug is missing! We have less than 18 hours til his wedding! We do not have time for this!
VICK: I'm trying to save your life here, Alan Mervish.
ALAN: I'm not kidding, man! Life is one long series of emergencies, and if you don't learn to stop and have a little fun along the way, you're gonna grow into a joyless old prick like your dad. I'm sorry to bring Moshe Mervish into it, but it had to be said. Now yes, we have 18 hours to find Doug which means we can afford to spend ten minutes celebrating the special talents of these gifted young body-artists. So sit down, have a jager shot, and smell the goddamn roses for once in your miserable life. Chastity, honey? When you're ready?
VICK: I'm not kidding, man! Life is one long series of emergencies, and if you don't learn to stop and have a little fun along the way, you're gonna grow into a joyless old prick like your dad.

So sit down, have a jager shot, and smell the goddamn roses for once in your miserable life. Chastity, honey? When you're ready?
ALAN: No, look I am like totally against this, morally and politically. Plus Becky specifically asked me not to
STU: I think I know why he married her.
VICK: Because if he hadn't, I would've.
STU: Is it weird that we're sitting this close watching?
VICK: Not for me.
STU: I really shouldn't be here. I have
VICK: Not that can do that.
STU: How can she do that without dislocating her hip?
VICK: Because she's been touched by God.
ALAN: Whoa, whoa, I'm smelling the roses
VICK: Come on, man! We got company!
CHASTITY: Come on!
CHASTITY: Come on!
STU: Did she just do that in heels?!
VICK: I'm really starting to like this
STU: Did you see them trample those tiny Japanese businessmen?! I think they killed like four of them!
VICK: Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't just a little fun.
ALAN: That was.a little fun.
STU: ( SCARED ) You're coming with us.
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: Where were you last night at 3am?
VICK: No idea.
OFFICER BLADEN: Okay, how about at 2am?
VICK: Officer Bladen SLAMS the table with his fist.
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: You think this is cute, son?! You think this is a game?!
ALAN: Whatever we did, we're so sorry!
STU: Honestly, man, I will confess to anything you want!
VICK: Stu: stop talking. Alan: sit up straight. Officer Merriweather, I've told you twelve times now: we have no memory of last night. Now either charge us with a crime, or let us go.
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: What do you know about Jimmy Lang?
ALAN: Who is he?
STU: Who is he?
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: Jimmy Lang runs the infamous Shiang- Xi crime organization, and is wanted in seven states for money laundering, drug smuggling, racketeering and murder.
ALAN: Oh my god
STU: Did we kill someone last night?!
VICK: We have no idea who this man is.
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: Is that right?
VICK: Yeah, that's right.
STU: We're in a lot of trouble, aren't Officers, I swear, we have no memory of that ever occurring
ALAN: Officers, I swear, we have no memory of that ever occurring
OFFICER BLADEN: Okay. Maybe a night in jail will jostle something loose.
STU: Oh no, sir, please don't!
ALAN: We have a very important wedding!
VICK: I know Jimmy Lang.
ALAN: You do?!
VICK: Jimmy and I tried to raise capital for Girl-nasium, a 24 hour fitness center and day spa for tween-age girls, but it never got off the ground. It was an entirely legitimate enterprise I had no idea he was a criminal. We must've bumped into him last night, and he must've invited us to join his birthday celebration. No crime in that, is there, Officers?
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: You actually expect me to believe that dung?
VICK: ( UNBLINKING ) Yes, Officer Merriweather. I do.
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: If I find out you're lying to me, son, I will take all of you down, is that clear?
OFFICER BLADEN: You boys wouldn't last three hours in prison.
VICK: Stu might.
OFFICER BLADEN: Get outta here.
ALAN: Oh, thank you, Officers!
STU: It was really nice meeting you!
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: If you know what's good for you, you'll get the hell out of Vegas.
ALAN: Did you have to be such a dick?!
VICK: We got out, didn't we?
ALAN: Yeah, four hours later! If we'd just cooperated with them
VICK: If we'd cooperated with them, we'd be in jail right now, Alan.
ALAN: What are we gonna do now? We've got zero leads on where Doug is!
STU: Why hasn't he called? It's 8:30.
VICK: Stu, don't. Doug is fine.
STU: I mean, we were hanging out with mobsters last night, man! They kill people for looking at `em weird!
VICK: Stu: Doug is fine.
STU: Or what if we like drove Doug out to the desert and left him, just as like a funny prank?!
VICK: Stu! Enough!
ALAN: ( MUTTERING ) I knew I shouldn't have come.
VICK: What did you just say?
ALAN: I said I knew I shouldn't have come this weekend, Vick!
VICK: ( getting heated ) Is that right?
ALAN: Yeah, that's right. I only came because Doug insisted.
VICK: Why do think you're so much better than us, dude?!
ALAN: I don't I just think I'm better than you, Vick! And trust me, it's not that hard! You haven't changed one bit since high school! Jesus, you're 28 years old and you still talk back to cops?! Really?!
VICK: You're out of your depth, Alan
ALAN: And you're still the one getting us in trouble! Only then it was hiding your weed in our locker, and now you've got us partying with wanted felons! It's not cute anymore, man! We're too old for this!
STU: Okay, let's all take a breath
ALAN: When's the last time you had a real job, man?! When's the last time you had a girlfriend?! Hell, when's the last time you picked up the check?!
VICK: What's so great about any of those Those "things," Vick, are what grown men do!
ALAN: Those "things," Vick, are what grown men do!
STU: Look, we're all tired and hungry
VICK: None of us ever liked you, Alan! We only hung out with you because Doug made us!
ALAN: Stu.? Is that true?
VICK: Why would anyone like you, dude? Have you ever thought about that? You're uptight, you're judgemental, you're cheap, and yet somehow you think you're sweeter than everyone else! Well look around, man: no one wants to be you! I'd rather be Stu than you!
STU: Wait, what?
ALAN: I've.always.hated you.
VICK: You punch like.your sister.
STU: Hey, no! Time out! We all need a time out!
CHASTITY: That might not be like, the smartest place to fight?
STU: Good call on happy hour, Chastity. These tacos kick ass.
CHASTITY: Yeah, I always come here when I get out of jail.
ALAN: Hey how'd you start Vick's car?
CHASTITY: Oh, my daddy taught me how to hotwire almost anything.
VICK: That's funny, because Alan's daddy taught him tax law.
ALAN: And Vick's daddy taught him how to get really drunk at his kid's soccer games and then piss himself.
VICK: It's a disease, dude!
STU: Guys, come on! For Doug?
ALAN: What if it's Doug?
VICK: What if it's Tracy?!
STU: ( torn, answers phone ) Good evening, this is Stu!
TRACY: Stu, it's Tracy!
STU: It's Tracy!
VICK: Because she knows you're the most easily tricked.
ALAN: We have tell her we lost Doug.
VICK: No we don't! Tell her nothing, Stu!
STU: Hey, Trace! W-What's going on?
TRACY: Oh, nothing, just here with my Wow, that sounds amazing!
STU: Wow, that sounds amazing!
TRACY: Yeah.? Hey, you wouldn't happen to know where Doug is, would you? He said he'd be home by 5 for this dinner, and now it's almost 9:00. I tried his cell, but he didn't Ummmm....Hang on. She wants to know where Doug is!
STU: Ummmm....Hang on. She wants to know where Doug is!
VICK: I'm working on it! Buy us some No, just tell her the truth! Honesty is always the best policy!
ALAN: No, just tell her the truth! Honesty is always the best policy!
VICK: What are you, retarded?! Honesty is never the best policy! Especially not with brides!
STU: ( lamely, to phone ) Um, what'd you say?
TRACY: ( FROWNING ) I asked if you knew where Doug was.
STU: Yeah, um, hang on. She still wants to know!
VICK: Okay: tell her Alan got really drunk last night and fell down, and the doctor said not to move him for a few hours, but that we'll be back in time for the wedding.
ALAN: Why do I have to be the one that fell over drunk?!
VICK: It's a fictitious canard, Alan, get over yourself! Stu: tell her!
DOCTOR: Fell over drunk.
VICK: Fell over drunk.
STU: H-He was drunk. And the doctor a different doctor, not the one he fell on he said we couldn't move him until the wedding
VICK: For a few hours! We'll be home before the wedding!
STU: But we're going to have the wedding at your home
VICK: Tracy?! Vick! How are ya, hon?
TRACY: ( now very concerned ) Vick, what is going on?
VICK: Nothing! Stu is a moron. Listen, Alan hurt his back last night, so we're gonna be laid up here for a bit, but I promise we'll have Doug home in time for the wedding, okay?
TRACY: Oh God, is Alan all right?
VICK: Yes, luckily he had a steel rod surgically implanted up his ass at birth, so the doctors anticipate a complete and swift recovery.
TRACY: Can I talk to Doug?
VICK: What? No! No, you can't actually, Doug.Doug is out.
TRACY: Where is he?
VICK: Where is he? He's aaaat.the pharmacy. Yeah, picking up Alan's medications. Listen, Trace, I'm losing you, but we'll see you tomorrow, okay? Bye, sweetie!
TRACY: They've done something stupid.
MR. TURNER: No surprise there.
TRACY: MR. TURNER
DAD: MR. TURNER
MR. TURNER: I'm just saying, what kind of man stands up his fiancée the night before their wedding?
TRACY: Dad, I don't want to hear it. I trust Doug absolutely.
ALAN: Perfect. We just told Tracy we'd have Doug home in 13 hours, and we still have no idea where he is.
DOORMAN: Handstamp for re-entry? Handstamp for re-entry?
VICK: Maybe we should go back to the hotel and
STU: Oh my God, guys! Look!
ALAN: It's like a map of last night!
STU: Where do you want to start?!
VICK: At the top! We hit every club we went to til someone remembers what we did with Doug!
ALAN: Nice clue, Stuey! I can't believe we're actually gonna pull this off!
STU: Hey: is that guy wearing Doug's
VICK: Naaah, couldn't be.
ALAN: Lots of people have hats like that.
STU: All right, this is the last place we went, "Chaps."
CHAPS NIGHTCLUB: It takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in line is male, buff, and wearing erotic cowboy gear.
STU: You sure we came here.?
ALAN: The Golden Pony. That's us.
STU: Maybe I'll just wait in the car
VICK: You think we would've remembered Yeah, I don't think we came here.
STU: Yeah, I don't think we came here.
ALAN: Then why is your underwear nailed to the wall?
STU: Those could be anybody's. Thousands of people go to Colorado State
ALAN: ( looking more closely ) Oh my God, are they autographed?
VICK: ( READING ) "Stu Pryce, 9/30/08. I Chaps!"
STU: ( realizing, stunned ) I am so gay.
WAITER: Hey, guys! Roger is backstage!
STU: INT. CHAPS DANCE FLOOR The guys move through the throng of undulating, sweaty men, uncomfortable. Alan takes Chastity's hand tightly.
ALAN: Stay very close to me.
BOUNCER: How are Haylee and Kaitlin?
STU: ( totally disturbed ) Oh. G-Good, thanks.?
VICK: We're going to love you either way,
ALAN: Some of my best friends are gay.
STU: Is that true?
ALAN: Not.not really? I live in Connecticut, man, we don't even have black people yet.
VICK: Excuse me, friend, can you tell me where Roger is?
BEEFCAKE COWBOY: Oh, hey, Vick! Roger's over there.
VICK: He's cute.I guess.?
ROGER: Oh! Hey guys!
STU: ( inhaling sharply ) Oh my god.
VICK: Listen, man, we don't really remember what happened last night, can you fill us in?
ROGER: Really? No memory?
STU: Did we.you know.do anything?
ROGER: Well, duh? Yeah?
STU: Was I.the boy or the girl?
ROGER: Oh, honey, you were everything.
VICK: Wait what?!
ROGER: I know, I'm sort of over group stuff too, but Alan insisted.
VICK: You insisted?! Why'd you insist?!
ALAN: I don't know! I don't know why I Actually, after the anger went away, it was really quite tender.
ROGER: Actually, after the anger went away, it was really quite tender.
STU: I'm really not sure we can be friends anymore.
CHASTITY: Guys: he's kidding.
VICK: Not cool, Roger. Not cool.
ALAN: So what did happen last night?
ROGER: Oh, well, you guys came in near the end of our last set, like 2ish. Doug pretty much dragged you in.
ALAN: Really? Doug did?
ROGER: Oh no, my Doug, not your Doug. Black guy, shaved head?
VICK: ( snapping his finger ) The guy from the Jimmy Lang surveillance video.
ROGER: Anyway, for the big finale of our show, we always bring someone on stage, and, well, Stu, you volunteered pretty aggressively. Hey Dallas, do we have the video of last night's show?
STU: No! That's cool, I don't need to see it
VICK: We must see that video.
DALLAS: It's in the machine.
ROGER: You were pretty mellow at first, Stu, but once we got you into the chaps, you really came alive oh, here it is.
STU: I'm a Dad, I-I don't get to the gym as much as I'd like.
ROGER: You even taught us The Pony, which we'd never even heard of before.
STU: Annnnd that would explain the searing ass pain.
ROGER: After the show, we split a couple pitchers of flirtinis, you had our stylist cut your hair like mine, and then you split.
VICK: And what time was all this?
ROGER: 4:30 in the morning? 4:45?
ALAN: And our Doug was with us?
ROGER: Yeah, he had passed out by then, but you carried him out. It was all very Officer And A Gentleman.
ALAN: Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45, we got back to the hotel at 5:00, and Doug was gone by 5:30 when Chastity met back up with us?
STU: That doesn't make any sense.
VICK: Did we lose him along the way?
STU: He was passed out, how far could he have gone?
VICK: INTERCUT WITH: INT. MANDALAY BAY NIGHT Atashir is on the phone at the reception desk.
ATASHIR: Mr. Lennon?
VICK: Atashir, many greetings to you.
ATASHIR: I thought you might like to know that one of our maids just found your friend, Douglas, passed out in your room.
VICK: What?! Are you sure it's him?!
ATASHIR: I saw him with my own eyes. He is unconscious but breathing nicely.
VICK: Oh thank you, Atashir! You are a man of great honor! A thousand blessings upon your ancestors!
STU: They're sure it's him?!
VICK: Atashir swears it is!
STU: Oh thank God he's okay.
ALAN: After all this?! He's in the room?!
VICK: I don't even care! Hug me, you big shiny homosexual!
ALAN: That was cool of Roger to give you all the tapes of your performance.
STU: I know, if I actually was gay, I'd totally date Roger first. What a gentle soul.
VICK: How we doing on time?
ALAN: ( looking at watch )
VICK: We'll be in LA by dawn. I told you bitches this would all work out.
ALAN: This has officially been the craziest weekend of my life. Thanks for all your help. You were Anything for my hubby.
CHASTITY: Anything for my hubby.
ALAN: I'm sorry about all this, Chastity.
CHASTITY: Beg pardon?
ALAN: Beg pardon?
CHASTITY: My name is Jennifer. Jennifer Elly.
ALAN: Okay, well, I'm sorry, Jennifer.
CHASTITY: Oh, don't be. Last night wasn't the first flaky decision I've ever made in my life. I mean, I am a
ALAN: Where you from?
CHASTITY: LA. Tarzana.
ALAN: Oh yeah?
CHASTITY: Yeah. I work here on the weekends.
ALAN: You fly out every week?
CHASTITY: Yeah. I'd move, but my kid is in a great school.
ALAN: ( aside, to Stu ) They always have kids.
VICK: ( aside, to Stu ) They always have kids.
CHASTITY: I have a little girl, Sarah. She's. Well, she's everything.
ALAN: No kids. Same girlfriend for 14 years. Becky.
CHASTITY: Wow, she's stunning.
STU: We like you way better.
ALAN: Chastity tries to stymie her laugh.
STU!: Chastity tries to stymie her laugh.
STU: Becky collects teapots.
VICK: Yeah, she's a total canwego.
CHASTITY: A what?
VICK: You know, she's the girl at the party who's always like "Can we go? Can we go?"
ALAN: She has low blood sugar.
STU: She has low fun sugar.
ALAN: Jesus, guys! This is the girl I'm going to marry! If, you know.she forgives me for cheating on her.
VICK: Wait: you're going to tell her?
ALAN: Of course I'm going to tell her! I could never keep something like that from her.
VICK: Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me for scratching her Queensryche CD in sixth grade she's neeeeever gonna forgive you for marrying a stripper in Vegas.
ALAN: Well, then that's just the price I'm going to have to pay.
CHASTITY: Good for you.
VICK: She's gonna cut your dick off,
VICK: ( to the valet ) Keep `er close, Paco. We'll be right back.
VICK: Doug! Wake up, man!
KALOLO FANALUA: Aloha, assholes.
STU: The door SLAMS behind them, and they whip around to see KIKIOLANI standing in front of the door, blocking their exit. He has an identical CAST on his right arm.
JIMMY LANG: Oh, hello. Good to see you again.
VICK: Where is Doug?
ALAN: Listen, Mr. Lang, whatever we did last night, we are incredibly sorry-
JIMMY LANG: These your rich friends you were telling me about, Vick?
ALAN: What's going on, Vick?
JIMMY LANG: Six months ago, your friend Vick borrowed some money from me at what can only be described as a very unfavorable interest rate. When the loan came due, he failed to pay me back, but he promised me that he could get the money from you guys this weekend.
ALAN: Jesus, Vick.
STU: How could you do this to us, man? We're your best friends.
VICK: They were gonna hurt me, man.
JIMMY LANG: Well, Vick, it looks like you and your friends have some issues to discuss. In the meantime.
VICK: I can get it! I can! I just
JIMMY LANG: I've heard that before, Vick, including last night, when you so rudely skipped out on my birthday party. That's why I've taken some collateral to ensure your payment. His name is Doug.
VICK: You have Doug?
STU: Oh my God.
JIMMY LANG: If you want your friend to live, meet me at mile marker 26 off Highway 12 at dawn, and bring the money. Are we clear?
VICK: Yes! Yes.
ALAN: M-M-Mr. Lang?
JIMMY LANG: Yes, Mr. Mervish?
ALAN: H-How much does Vick owe?
ALAN: How the hell could you blow that kind of money?!
STU: Was it for the custard store?
ALAN: Jesus, Stu, wake up! There is no custard store! Vick was just trying to rip us off to pay back Jimmy Is that true, Vick?
STU: Is that true, Vick?
VICK: ( GUILTY )
STU: Dude, I manage an Applebee's, that money meant something to me.
VICK: Do you really think I wanted my life to turn out like this, Stu?! Do you really think I don't know that I'm a massive loser?!
STU: Come on, Vick
VICK: No, man, it's true! I put on a good show, but my life is so goddamn hollow and vapid and lonely, it scares me, man. I-I don't know how much longer I can keep this scam going. And now I've gone and ruined the one good thing I had.
STU: Come on, man, we've been bro's since third grade, it's gonna take a lot more than money to ruin our
VICK: Love you too, bro. Love you too.
STU: Also, I banged your sister sophomore year.
VICK: Sorry. Just seemed like a good time to tell you.
STU: Sorry. Just seemed like a good time to tell you.
VICK: No! No. That's.that's plenty.
ALAN: Look, I'm glad we're all sharing, but we've got three hours to come up with 200 grand, or else.
STU: I think I can get a 20 grand cash advance on my credit card.
ALAN: So that just leaves 180 grand.
CHASTITY: Well, it is Vegas.
STU: Time check!
VICK: ( looking at watch ) 12 minutes.
STU: Chip check!
VICK: Dude, how many Red Bulls have you I stopped counting at six! I can hear my heart beating in my head!
STU: I stopped counting at six! I can hear my heart beating in my head!
ALAN: Just over 100 grand.
VICK: There's only one thing left to do.
STU: You sure we don't want red?! What if the ball lands on red!
VICK: Shut up, Stu.
ROULETTE CROUPIER: Betting is closed.
STU: I can't watch! My heart's gonna explode! Can your heart even explode?! Because I think my heart is gonna explode! I can't watch!
ALAN: It's not red.
CHASTITY: Would you like me to come with?
ALAN: No.It might get a little dangerous. I wouldn't want.
CHASTITY: I'm so sorry.about everything.
ALAN: Thanks for all your help.
CHASTITY: There's no sense.in exchanging numbers or anything.right?
ALAN: Yeah, probably not.
CHASTITY: Well.I'll always remember you as a great first husband, then.
VICK: We gotta go, man.
ALAN: Yep, just driving out to the middle of desert to meet some mobsters, what could possibly go wrong.?
STU: So what's our plan?
ALAN: I think we should tell Mr. Lang that we couldn't get the money, but that, if he's amenable, we could create a payment calendar
VICK: We're gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag of money, grab Doug, and make a run for it.
ALAN: Yes, good! What an airtight plan!
VICK: Jimmy Lang doesn't do payment calendars, Alan! Trust me: this is our only shot of getting Doug back! Left turn!
TRACY: Any word from Doug?
MR. TURNER: ( BEAT ) I know you don't want to hear it, Trace, but you deserve better.
TRACY: I'm sure everything's fine. They're all smart, capable adults.
VICK: This all the cash we got?
ALAN: This is the dumbest plan ever.
VICK: Alan I need you positive please.
STU: Here they come.
VICK: There's an emergency bottle of tequila in my glove box. Get it out
STU: There's an emergency bottle of tequila in my glove box. Get it out
VICK: There's an emergency bottle of tequila in my glove box. Get it out
ALAN: I can't believe this is how we're going to die.
JIMMY LANG: Let's see the money!
VICK: Let's see Doug!
ALAN: Jesus, what'd they do to him?
VICK: Pull off the Ralph's bag!
VICK: Who the hell is that?!
JIMMY LANG: ( ANNOYED ) This is Doug!
ALAN: Oh my God: it's the other Doug! Roger's friend, the cake designer!
BLACK DOUG: ( to Jimmy Lang ) I told you, man, I'm Doug Howland! I barely even know these guys!
VICK: Yeah, you got the wrong Doug, man!
JIMMY LANG: You sure?!
VICK: Yeah, man, our Doug is white!
JIMMY LANG: But you were partying with this guy at my birthday thing!
VICK: I don't know what to tell you, bro, this isn't the Doug we requested!
JIMMY LANG: Well. I apologize for the mix-up. But I'm still gonna need my money.
ALAN: Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God.
JIMMY LANG: Don't move, Vick.
NOTHING HAPPENS: Jimmy is built like a tank. Vick freezes, oh shit. Then Jimmy PISTOL-WHIPS Vick his lip explodes with blood and he falls to the ground.
VICK: Christ that hurts!
STU: Jimmy looks up to see Stu insanely charging him like the linebacker he once was! Jimmy raises his gun, but
AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!: Jimmy looks up to see Stu insanely charging him like the linebacker he once was! Jimmy raises his gun, but
ALAN: I'm being shot at! I'm being shot
UP AHEAD: Jimmy Lang throws Stu off of him and recovers his gun, panting. He cocks it, aims it at Stu on the ground.
JIMMY LANG: I really didn't want to kill anyone
TODAY: Then WHAM! Alan drives the car into Jimmy Lang at 25mph! The obese mobster is pitched off his feet, and lands a good ten yards away, in a heap of dust! The guys freeze, shocked.
ALAN: Oh my god, is he okay?!
VICK: Who cares! Go go!
STU: I can't believe you just saved my I can't believe you just drove my car into Jimmy Lang!
VICK: I can't believe you just drove my car into Jimmy Lang!
STU: He's gonna be really upset!
ALAN: Yeah, I was just thinking that!
KIKIOLANI: Boss, Boss, you okay?!
JIMMY LANG: Find Vick. And kill him.
ALAN: Now can we call Tracy?
VICK: Yeah. It's probably time.
ALAN: Who wants to make the call?
STU: That was you!
ALAN: What?! No! I beat you by a mile!
STU: Vick, who won?!
VICK: ( FROWNING ) Actually.I should do it. This weekend was mostly my fault. I need to Man Up.
ALAN: Well, I'll be damned.
VICK: I still can't believe Stu banged my
MR. TURNER: Any word from Doug?
TRACY: No, but I'm sure he's
VICK: In the desert, on the pay phone, looking through his busted aviators into the rising sun.
VICK: Tracy, it's Vick.
TRACY: Hey Vick!
VICK: Listen, honey.The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well.we lost Doug.
TRACY: ( her jaw dropping ) What?! But we're getting married in like four hours!
VICK: Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
VICK: Look, I'm really sorry, Trace. This is all my fault
ALAN: Tracy, it's Alan! Hey, Vick is just joking around! We've got Doug right
TRACY: ( HORRIFIED ) What kind of joke is that?!
ALAN: I know, Vick is such a prick! We'll see you at the wedding! Bye!
VICK: What are you doing?
ALAN: I know where Doug is!
ALAN: Remember when we saw Doug's bed impaled on the griffin thing?!
STU: Yeah, we threw it out the window.
ALAN: No: the windows don't open, So how did?
VICK: So how did?
STU: I don't get it.
ALAN: And that's why we've been seeing Doug's clothes all over Vegas! He was trying to signal someone!
VICK: I don't believe it.
STU: I-I still don't get it
ALAN: And it totally jives with the timeline, right?! We brought Doug back to the hotel at 5:00, he was passed out.
VICK: It's so obvious!
STU: Not.to me.so much?
VICK: How'd you figure it out?!
ALAN: The Patron, man! It reminded me of our first drink of the night!
VICK: Honestly, dude, you're a genius.
STU: CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHERE DOUG IS?! He's on the roof!
DOUG IS?!: He's on the roof!
VICK: He's on the roof!
ALAN: After Doug passed out, we must've taken him up there in his bed as a prank, so he'd wake up on the roof or whatever? Then we forgot him.
VICK: And all day he's been throwing his crap off the roof, trying to signal someone to get him down!
STU: You think he's still up there?!
ALAN: Only one way to find out.
ALAN: DOUG?! DOUG?! WHERE ARE YOU, MAN?!
DOUG?! DOUG?!: WHERE ARE YOU, MAN?!
VICK: WHERE ARE YOU, MAN?!
IS DOUG!: And he looks furious. The guys run to him, overjoyed!
ALAN: Oh my god, I'm so glad you're okay!
