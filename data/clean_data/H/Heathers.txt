HEATHERS: An Original Screenplay
VERONICA: What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
HEATHER DUKE: Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
VERONICA: Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus.
VERONICA: ( submissively ) Hello, Heather.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
VERONICA: Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
HEATHER CHANDLER: You don't have anything either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
VERONICA: I'll think about it.
HEATHER CHANDLER: ( looking off ) Don't think.
CAFETERIA ENTRANCE: VERONICA's arm, seemingly involuntary, latches onto the outstretched pen.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Splendid. I'll dictate. Veronica needs something to write on. Heather, bend over.
HEATHER CHANDLER: How nice. Two assholes: no waiting.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Heather Duke, back down.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Dear Martha, you're so sweet..
KURT: It'd be so righteous to be in a Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler sandwich. Punch it in, Ram. Hell yes. I wanna set a Heather on my Johnson and just start spinning her like a fucking pinwheel.
RAM: Hell yes. I wanna set a Heather on my Johnson and just start spinning her like a fucking pinwheel.
EARL: Shit. Right.
RAM: Damn right right.
CAFETERIA ENTRANCE: In slow motion, VERONICA finishes the note and rises up along with her makeshift desk, HEATHER DUKE. HEATHER MCNAMARA hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line. VERONICA hands the note to an impressed HEATHER CHANDLER. MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK pays the CASHIER and then, grasping her lunch tray with both paws, moves toward VERONICA and the HEATHERS. HEATHER MCNAMARA excitedly tugs on HEATHER CHANDLER'S arm as MARTHA approaches. With a tranquil smile, HEATHER CHANDLER passes the note to her frantic disciple. In a self-consciously clandestine manner, HEATHER MCNAMARA saunters past MARTHA then wields around to sneakily tuck the note onto MARTHA's tray. The slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles past a magnetic preppie PETER DAWSON and a thin, black, bespectacled DENNIS. The guys are working a large stand which has a cashbox reading THE FAMINE FUND and a banner reading WESTERBURG FEEDS THE WORLD.
PETER: Come on people, let's give that leftover lunch money to people without lunches! Those tater tots you threw away today are a delicacy in Africa! They're Thanksgiving dinner!
HEATHERS' TABLE: The Girls reach their table with HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE sitting themselves down first.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: ( looking to the stand ) God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
VERONICA: ( low key sarcasm ) Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Sawyer. Guess what today is?
VERONICA: Ouch..the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
HEATHER DUKE: Yeah, so what's the question?
HEATHER CHANDLER: God-damn Heather, you were with me in Study Hall when I thought of it. Such a pillowcase.
HEATHER DUKE: ( hurt ) I forgot.
VERONICA: Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last..
HEATHER CHANDLER: Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
BETTY: Sorry Veronica.
VERONICA: Betty Finn. Gosh...
VERONICA: I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
BETTY: That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
VERONICA: Don't say that.
BETTY: Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day. BETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER, arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween costumes: BETTY is an angel, VERONICA is a witch. VERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor.
VERONICA: I was talking with someone!
HEATHER CHANDLER: Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
COURTNEY: Oh great. Here comes Heather.
COURTNEY'S FRIEND: MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE Alone at a table in the Siberia of the cafeteria, MARTHA finishes a forkful of chicken. She spears her plate again and brings the fork up. The note is wedged inside it.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Hi Courtney. Love your blouse. Ooh, let me snare a tater.
COURTNEY: Thanks. I just got it last night at the Limited. Totally blew my allowance.
HEATHER CHANDLER: That's pretty very. Now check this out. You win five million dollars from Publishers Clearing House, but on the same day Ed McMahon gives you the check, aliens land on earth and say they're going to blow up the world in two days. What would you do?
KEITH: That's easy. I'd just slide that wad over to my father. He's like one of the top brokers in the state.
VERONICA: Wake up. In two days, Earth's going up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City.
KEITH: Man, in two days, my dad could double my money. Triple it.
COURTNEY: If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
VERONICA: You're beautiful.
PETER: Dennis, my man, run over to Mickey D.'s and get me a Big Mac and some fries.
DENNIS: But that's the Famine Fund money.
PETER: Hey, even Bob Geldof's got to eat. If it makes you feel better, bag the fries, and nab yourself an Apple Pie.
CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE: HEATHER CHANDLER drags VERONICA down a cafeteria lane.
HEATHER CHANDLER: If you're going to openly be a bitch..
VERONICA: ( submissive ) I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
RODNEY: Did you see that? Heather Number One looked right at us.
BIG CYNIC: It must be love.
CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE: VERONICA confronts HEATHER CHANDLER.
VERONICA: Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
VERONICA: Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
HEATHER CHANDLER: ( giving in ) Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
BIG CYNIC: Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on the last day of Mankind. You sentimental old fart.
BRACES: Geez, forget it.
VERONICA: What about you Rodney?
RODNEY: ( quietly to the others ) I told you she knew my name. ( beat of contemplation ) I'd change my life. New clothes. New haircut. New house. New home.
HEATHER CHANDLER: How sad! Blowing all your cash on two days of trying to be hip.
VERONICA: If you're going to openly be a bitch..
HEATHER MCNAMARA: God, scan on Martha Dumptruck.
HEATHER CHANDLER: This is the part I hate. The waiting. I'd say we're like twenty minutes from major humiliation. Come on, Veronica.
HEATHER CHANDLER: VERONICA follows the leader. She calls out.
VERONICA: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER march into the school parking lot toward four HEAVY METALERS ( one female ) hanging out on a car hood. The girls' conversation is heard in voice-over.
JOCKS' TABLE: VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER warily stand at the outskirts of the JOCKS' bastion of vulgarity.
PARKING LOT: Heavy Metaler MATT grins.
MATT: You get five million dollars but some Martians are going to zap you in two days. You hear that, Clyde? That's got to be the most spooky-ass question I've ever heard.
BETTY FINN: I think we should use the money for an End-of-the-world get-together. We could invite guys.
JOCKS' TABLE: RAM sputters out some chicken to bellow.
RAM: I'd pay Madonna one million dollars to ride my face like the Kentucky Derby. She should be paying me, though.
STONERS' HALLWAY: A FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET starts to speak, then stops.
LIBRARY: The ALL-OUT NERD lashes out.
PARKING LOT: Heavy Metaler CLYDE turns from his friend MATT.
CLYDE: If you want a good way to go out before the aliens land, get a lion from the zoo. Put a remote control bomb up its butt. When the lion starts tearing you up, press the bomb button. You and the lion die like as one.
CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE: VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER continue their conversation chugging through another busy cafeteria lane.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
VERONICA: Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Oh God, here we go.
PETER: A dime increases the time! A buck brings good luck! Hi Veronica. A five keeps the neighborhood alive! A ten and you die without sen!
HEATHER CHANDLER: ( to Veronica ) You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
VERONICA: I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
HEATHER CHANDLER: That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
VERONICA: ( slapping her knee ) We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
VERONICA: A true friend's work is never done.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Color me nauseous.
THE STALL: VERONICA stands in a tight stall with an ashamed HEATHER DUKE.
VERONICA: Maybe you should see a doctor.
HEATHER DUKE: Yeah, maybe.
VERONICA: Geez, don't listen to them.
HEATHER DUKE: Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
VERONICA: Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
CAFETERIA ENTRANCE: A gnarly melange of chicken and potatoes is scraped off a plate into a cafeteria trashcan as VERONICA and the HEATHERS stroll by outside. VERONICA pauses to peer in at the JAMES DEANESQUE GUY.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
VERONICA: Give me the clipboard.
VERONICA: Hello Jason Dean.
JASON: Greetings and salutations. Call me J.D. Are you a Heather?
VERONICA: No, a Veronica. Sawyer. This may seem like a stupid question..
VERONICA: If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
JOCKS' TABLE: The JOCKS witness VERONICA and J.D.
RAM: Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
KURT: Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
RAM: Let's kick his ass.
KURT: Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
J.D.'S TABLE: An intrigued J.D. laconically answers the question.
VERONICA: How very.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Come on.
RAM: You going to eat this?
KURT: What did your you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
RAM: Answer him dick!
KURT: Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
KURT: What did you say dickweed?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
HEATHER CHANDLER: He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
VERONICA: No way. He used blanks. All J.D. really did was ruin two pairs of pants.Maybe not even that. Can you bleach out urine stains?
HEATHER CHANDLER: J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
VERONICA: Never say never.
HEATHER DUKE: What are you going to do, Heather? Take the two shots or send me out?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast? First you ask if you can be red, knowing that I'm always red.
HEATHER DUKE: HEATHER CHANDLER's next shot falls short of the next wicket.
HEATHER CHANDLER: ( to HEATHER DUKE ) Damn. It's your turn Heather.
HEATHER DUKE: No, it's Heather's turn.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: King David.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam- thank-you-maam" Sweeney.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Ram's sweet. Yo Heather, you're up.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: No way, no day!
VERONICA: Give it up girl!
HEATHER CHANDLER: What. A. Shot. HEATHER DUKE's next shot falls short of the next wicket. VERONICA begins setting up her shot.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
HEATHER CHANDLER: I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
VERONICA: ( missing her shot ) Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
HEATHER DUKE: HEATHER CHANDLER
HEATHER CHANDLER: Why not?
MOM: Heather, your Mother's here.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Come on whoever wants a ride.
DAD: Take a break Veronica, sit down.
VERONICA: All right.
DAD: So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
VERONICA: I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
MOM: Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
VERONICA: I guess.
MOM: Any contestants worth mentioning?
VERONICA: horse now in the running.
DAD: ( looking up ) Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
VERONICA: ( smiling ) Because you're an idiot.
DAD: Oh yeah, that's it.
MOM: ( shaking her head ) You two..
VERONICA: Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Corn nuts!
VERONICA: No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
VERONICA: Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
VERONICA: I didn't. Cherry.
VERONICA: Great bike.
VERONICA: I don't know. Should you?
VERONICA: Time out..Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
VERONICA: ( gently joking ) Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
VERONICA: It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
VERONICA: It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
DAVID: Throw your coats on the bed, girls.
WHINING STUDENT: That exam was so bogus.
COED ONE: Oh I
DAVID: Veronica, this is Brad.
BRAD: Excellent. Did you girls bring your partying slippers?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Yeah, let's party.
DAVID: She loves to party.
DORMITORY HALLWAY: The chaotic hallway rumbles with beer cups and loud music. VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER's stylish garb clashes with the laid-back dress of the COLLEGE STUDENTS. BRAD anxiously hands VERONICA a cup of beer as he watches DAVID and HEATHER CHANDLER move through a staircase door.
BRAD: So, are you a cheerleader?
VERONICA: ( dealing with a jerk ) No, not at all.
BRAD: You're pretty enough to be one.
VERONICA: Gee, thanks.
BRAD: It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
BRAD: So when you go to college, what kind of subjects do you think you'll study?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Come on David, let's go back to the party.
DAVID: ( unzipping his pants ) Don't worry, we will. You're just so hot tonight. I can't control myself.
DORM HALLWAY: BRAD has given up on conversation.
BRAD: So what do you say we head up to my room and have a real party. I've got the best Windham Hill C.D. collection in the dorm.
BRAD: You're kidding. That pecker actually scored something on his own?
BRAD: Excellent. Veronica, ever do
VERONICA: Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
BRAD: Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
VERONICA: Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
BRAD: Hey, don't run away now.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: VERONICA rampages through her diary.
VERONICA: VERONICA flings the screeching cat off and continues.
J.F.K.!: VERONICA flings the screeching cat off and continues.
BRAD: How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come on.
VERONICA: Hey really, I don't feel so great.
BRAD: Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
VERONICA: I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.. Gee Blank, I had a nice..
BRAD: Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
VERONICA: You don't deserve my fucking speech!
DORM HALLWAY: VERONICA storms into the hallway but slows down when she sees she's attracting attention. She notices an incited BRAD slither to the smiling DAVID who chats with some STUDENTS, HEATHER CHANDLER on his arm. BRAD causes DAVID's smile to ever-so-slightly diminish. DAVID whispers to HEATHER CHANDLER who proceeds to set down her beer and walk toward VERONICA.
DORMITORY ALLEY: The fire in the trashcan is raging.
DORM HALLWAY: A steel faced HEATHER CHANDLER comes face-to-face with VERONICA.
HEATHER CHANDLER: What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
VERONICA: Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
HEATHER CHANDLER: No. Hell no.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: VERONICA savagely scrawls in her diary, tears burning fierce.
DORM HALLWAY: VERONICA rises into view with tinges of vomit on her mouth. A smile breaks across HEATHER CHANDLER's granite puss. VERONICA runs off as STUDENTS laugh in the background.
DORMITORY ALLEY: VERONICA charges into the alley. She whips around to face a screeching HEATHER CHANDLER. In back of VERONICA, the trashcan bellows like Mt. Vesuvius.
HEATHER CHANDLER: You stupid cunt!
VERONICA: You goddamn bitch!
HEATHER CHANDLER: You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
VERONICA: Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
HEATHER CHANDLER: ( totally in control ) Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: VERONICA flings her diary across the room where it hits the wall behind the stunning figure of J.D. VERONICA gasps.
VERONICA: ( exhaling deeply ) I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
VERONICA: Sure. But I'm Blue.
VERONICA: What a night.
VERONICA: What a life. I almost moved into high school out of sixth grade because I was some genius. We all decided to chuck the idea because I'd have trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah.
VERONICA: Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
VERONICA: Killing her won't solve anything.
VERONICA: Well then, I'll pray for rain.
VERONICA: Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
VERONICA: There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
VERONICA: I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
VERONICA: But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
MRS. CHANDLER: We are leaving soon for your grandmother's. If you care to join us.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Bag that.
MRS. CHANDLER: Is that a "No" in your lingo?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Lingo this.
VERONICA: ( quietly ) Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
VERONICA: What about orange juice and milk? What's the upchuck factor on that?
VERONICA: Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
VERONICA: O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
VERONICA: What are you can't go...Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
VERONICA: Just give me a cup, jerk.
VERONICA: Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
VERONICA: No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
VERONICA: You're not funny.
VERONICA: VERONICA dreamily reaches out to one of the two ceramic cups. Not the one with milk and orange juice in it.
VERONICA: Morning, Heather.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
VERONICA: We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Did you put a phlegm globber in it or something? I'm not drinking that piss.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Intense? Grow up. You think I'll drink it just because you call me chicken.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Just give me the cup, jerk.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Corn nuts!
VERONICA: No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
VERONICA: Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna.
VERONICA: Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
VERONICA: It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
VERONICA: Like a suicide thing?
VERONICA: ( calming down ) I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
VERONICA: "You might think what I've done is "To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
VERONICA: That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
VERONICA: She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
VERONICA: You're probably right."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
VERONICA: That's good. Have you done this before?
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: Any other Principal would take the same position. Keep things business as usual.
COUNSELOR HYDE: Heather Chandler's not your everyday suicide. She was very popular.
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: I let the kids go before lunch and the switchboard'll light up like a Christmas Tree.
KEVIN STAPLES: The parents will be sympathetic, sir. These are troubled times for the young.
MRS. POPE: I must say I was impressed to see that she made proper use of the word "myriad" in her suicide note after brutalizing it in a vocabulary test.
PAULINE: ( dramatically cutting in ) I find it profoundly disturbing that we are told of a tragic destruction of youth and all we can talk about is adequate mourning times and misused vocabulary words.
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: Oh Christ.
PAULINE: The school, meaning both students and teachers, must revel in this revealing moment. I suggest we get everyone into the cafeteria and just talk. And feel. Together.
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: Thank you, Ms. Fleming. Call me when the shuttle lands.Now is this Heather the cheerleader?
COUNSELOR HYDE: That would be Heather Mcnamara.
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: Damn. I'd be willing to go half a day for a cheerleader.
KEVIN STAPLES: Let's just pack it in an hour early.
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: Done. I hate Mondays.
PAULINE: I said a circle you imbeciles! Forget it! Just sit down. I'm just so thrilled to be given an example of everything I've taught you. That example is Heather Chandler. I have the note!
MALE STUDENT: All right!
PAULINE: I'll pass the suicide note around the room so you can feel its tragic beauty for yourself. Let us share together the feelings the suicide has spurred in us all. Who wants to begin?
FEMALE STUDENT: I heard it was really gnarly. She drank Liquid Plumber and Comet and stuff then she smashed..
PAULINE: Now, now, we're not here to rehash the coroner's report. Let's talk emotions.
PETER: Heather and I used to go together, but she said I was boring. I realize now I wasn't really boring. She was just dissatisfied with her life.
PAULINE: That's very good Peter.
PAULINE: Dear Veronica, Heather was your Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
VERONICA: Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
VERONICA: She realized the only way she could be happy was to give up her power and the only way she could do that was death.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Oh God, it's so unfair. It's just so unfair! We should get a whole week off not just an hour.
HEATHER DUKE: Write the School Board.
VERONICA: Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
HEATHER DUKE: ( belching ) Fuck it.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Look, heather left behind one of her Swatches. She'd want you to have it, Veronica. She always said you couldn't accessorize for shit.
HEATHER DUKE: What a waste.
THE SHOWER: VERONICA turns on a shower and lets the water spray against her clothes.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Veronica, what are you doing?
SQUEALING GIRL: Everyone in the shower!
MATT: Do I deliver or do I deliver?
RODNEY: Hurry up, we're going to get caught.
MATT: Mellow out Geek. Man, I never should have brought you.
CLYDE: Let's see some pus
THE SHOWER: The GIRLS splash and spin in balletlike slow motion. VERONICA stands facing the viewer, the Swatch noticeably attached.
MATT: Does this have something to do with menstrual cramps and shit?
CLYDE: ( dazed ) What the fuck?
RODNEY: We're on Candid Camera, dudes. I can feel it.
CLYDE: What the fuck?
STEVE: Do you deliver or do you deliver?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: That was seriously warped, Veronica.
VERONICA: HEATHER DUKE
HEATHER DUKE: T.V. cameras!
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Oh God, Veronica. My hair! My clothes!
VERONICA: Next channel, darling.
VERONICA: Oh, I have to hear this.
VERONICA: ( muting Courtney ) What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her! ( to J.D. ) What are you smiling at?
VERONICA: Yeah. Scary stuff.
FRED DEAN: Hey Dad, how was work today?
FRED DEAN: It was miserable. Some damn tribe of withered old bitches doesn't want us to terminate that fleabag hotel. All because Glenn Miller and his band once took a shit there. It's just like Kansas. Do you remember fucking Kansas?
FRED DEAN: Fucking Kansas. Gosh Pop, I almost forgot to introduce my girlfriend.
VERONICA: VERONICA, with a forced smile, reaches to shaked FRED's hand. FRED DEAN extends his hand but makes no effort to stop rowing hence his hand pulls away from VERONICA. Pop and son laugh.
VERONICA: ( awkwardly standing ) My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
VERONICA: ( weakly )
DAD: Take a break Veronica, sit down.
VERONICA: All right.
DAD: So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
VERONICA: I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
MOM: Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
VERONICA: ( looking at his cigarette ) Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
DAD: ( looking at his cigarette ) Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
VERONICA: ( smiling ) Because you're an idiot.
DAD: Oh yeah, that's it.
MOM: ( shaking her head ) You two..
VERONICA: Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
FATHER RIPPER: ( cont'd ) It's Jesus Christ and he's in the book.
CHURCH LOBBY: HEATHER MCNAMARA dips a big comb in the holy water basin and then combs out her hair. VERONICA breezes by.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
VERONICA: Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
VERONICA: going with J.D.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
KURT: We on tonight man?
RAM: I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
KURT: Pretty weird.
KURT: That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
RAM: Let's kick his ass.
KURT: Cool off, we're seniors.
RAM: Goddamn Geek!
BRACES: ( awkwardly defiant ) Sit and spin.
KURT: That little prick.
KURT: All right you piece of shit fag, do you like to suck big dicks?
BRACES: Cut it out!
KURT: Say it man. Say I like to suck big dicks.
RODNEY: Leave him alone, Kurt.
BRACES: Okay, okay, you like to suck big dicks.
BRACES: I like to suck big dicks. Mmm- I can't get enough of them. Satisfied?
KURT: I'm sure your friends are happy to hear that. Right, guys?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Don't worry, Ram's been so sweet lately, consoling me and stuff. It'll be really very. Promise.
VERONICA: going to be one of those nights where they get shitfaced and take us to a pasture to tip cows.
KURT: Is it sleeping, dude?
RAM: I think so, man.
KURT: Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
RAM: Punch it in!
KURT: Count of three, guy.
KURT: "When I get that feeling, I need sexual healing..."
VERONICA: Yeah, right, asshole.
VERONICA: I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
KURT: ( still face down ) "Feel like making bah da dah bah da dah, feel like making love."
VERONICA: So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
KURT: "And she's buying the stairway to heaven.."
DENNIS: I'm not belittling the Famine Fund Peter, but we're talking teen suicide! Westerburg finally got one and I'm not going to blow it.
PETER: Great. Heather gets the headline and I get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon.
VERONICA: Hi Guys. I came to check on this week's lunchtime poll topic.
DENNIS: Don't worry about it, Veronica, sit down. That funeral yesterday must have been really rough.
VERONICA: Oh. Sure.
YEARBOOK GIRL: We were, uh, wondering if maybe you had some poems or artwork that Heather did that we could put in the Heather Chandler yearbook spread?
VERONICA: The what?
YEARBOOK GIRL: Take a look. We'll have a two page layout with her suicide note up here in the right hand corner.
DENNIS: It's more tasteful than it sounds.
VERONICA: I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
COURTNEY: Like last night, Veronica?
VERONICA: I'm sorry? I don't get it.
COURTNEY: You did last night.
COURTNEY'S FRIEND: Kurt told us of your little date.
VERONICA: Yeah. And? I left him drunk and flailing in cowshit.
COURTNEY: I don't know. He was really detailed.
PETER: Shut up, Courtney.
VERONICA: Don't shut up. I'd like to know just what I did.
PETER: ( gesturing to the door ) Let me show you that lunchtime poll topic, Veronica.
PETER: Kurt Kelly bu-ut he said you were bent over like a coffee table with Kurt going in one end and Ram coming in the other. Pardon the pun.
VERONICA: ( dazed ) Pardon the pun. Son-of-a-bitch.
VERONICA: Thanks Pete, for the Famine Fund.
VERONICA: Hi, Kurt? This is Veronica Sawyer. I didn't expect to be calling either. I guess my emotions took over. I was wondering if you wanted all those things you've been saying to really happen. It's always been a fantasy of mine to have two guys at once.. Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum.
VERONICA: That's right, tonight. In the woods behind the school. Don't forget Ram.
KURT: VERONICA'S BEDROOM VERONICA and J.D. load guns on VERONICA's bed. VERONICA breaks into a laugh.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: VERONICA and J.D. load guns on VERONICA's bed. VERONICA breaks into a laugh.
VERONICA: I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
VERONICA: You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
VERONICA: J.D. flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber.
VERONICA: So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
VERONICA: First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
VERONICA: Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
VERONICA: We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it was World War Two, not a school play.
VERONICA: Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
VERONICA: Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
VERONICA: You must have had fun.
VERONICA: Oh come Perrier. It's come a long way.
VERONICA: ( mock-seductively ) Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
RAM: ( singing ) Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and.
KURT: Shut the fuck up, all right.
RAM: Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
KURT: Hi Veronica.
VERONICA: ( forced cheerfulness ) Hi Guys. Glad you could make it.
RAM: So do we just start fucking?
VERONICA: I've made a circle on each end of the clearing. Ram, you come over here.
VERONICA: When you get in the circle, strip.
RAM: What about you?
VERONICA: I was hoping you'd rip my clothes off me, sport.
RAM: Oh. Good idea.
VERONICA: Count of three, guys.
VERONICA: KURT finally cracks a smile.
VERONICA: J.D. suddenly moves next to VERONICA holding a gun in his right hand and the feminine shopping bag in his left.
VERONICA: J.D. races to VERONICA in a white sweat.
VERONICA: ( giggling ) Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on..
THE PATH: A panicked KURT runs on the path through the woods.
THE CLEARING: VERONICA turns toward Ram's collapsed body.
THE PATH: KURT sees the opening at the end of the woods. J.D. suddenly moves into the light at the end of the woods and raises his gun. KURT runs back the other way with a strangled moan.
THE CLEARING: VERONICA approaches Ram's body with increasing shivers. He does not look bleeding and unconscious. He looks bleeding and dead, dead, dead. KURT barrels into the clearing as J.D. howls from the woods.
MILNER: I heard it that time! Another gunshot! From the woods! Shit, let's roll.
MILNER: Another gunshot! From the woods! Shit, let's roll.
THE CLEARING: J.D. puts his gun in RAM's right hand while VERONICA zombiesquely does the same with KURT and her gun.
VERONICA: Kurt doesn't look too good.
MILNER: Call in!
MILNER: I heard something out there. I'm checking it out. This is Officer McCord and I've got two dead bodies in the woods behind Westerburg High. Oh my God, one of them's Kurt Kelly, the quarterback.
THE HILL: VERONICA and J.D. reach the car, panting. MILNER races out of the woods just as VERONICA and J.D. slam the car doors closed behind them. MILNER huffs up the hill.
THE HILL: MILNER continues to move up the hill.
MILNER: Think what I heard was just a stinking owl. All I got is two kids making out in the backseat of a car. Should I pry them apart? Forget it. I got all the answers back here, partner.
THE CLEARING: MILNER runs back into the clearing.
MILNER: What's the deal? Suicide. Double Suicide. They shot each other.
MILNER: That's Kurt Kelly! Yeah, and the linebacker, Ram Sweeney.
MILNER: Oh my God, suicide? Why? Does this answer your question?
MILNER: Oh man, they were Listen up, "We could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world."
MILNER: Ah Jesus H. Fuck. Kurt was a Parade magazine Honorable Mention.
MILNER: Wait a second. How did they shoot each other if we heard two separate sets of gunshots? Shit, I always hear gunshots when I'm high. Life is one crazy bitch. Don't try to analyze it. The quarterback buggering the linebacker. What a waste.
MILNER: Oh the humanity.
KEVIN STAPLES: ( sotto voce to Counselor Hyde ) After every touchdown or whatever, they give each other a little slap on the bottom. It seems innocent.
MRS. POPE: Look at this. "Ununderstanding."
PAULINE: Will you shut up! We were in a similar position Monday and I thoughtfully suggested that we get the students together for an unadulterated emotional outpouring. You took the suggestion as an opportunity to play yet another round of "Let's laugh at the Hippie."
COUNSELOR HYDE: Pauline, if you want a tryout for the school play..
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: Shut up, Paul. I've seen a lot of bullshitangel dust, switchblades, sexually perverse photography exhibits involving tennis racquets, but this suicide thing..I guess it's all on Pauline's wavelength. We're just going to write off today, and Friday she can do her little little love-in or whatever. Whatever.
VERONICA: We killed them, didn't we?
VERONICA: Ich Luge bullets! I'm an idiot!
VERONICA: I did not want them
VERONICA: Did not.
VERONICA: Did not.
PARKING LOT: HEATHER DUKE and a vegged out HEATHER MCNAMARA stop sauntering through the parking lot to contemplate Veronica's hiccuping car and its sparring occupants.
HEATHER DUKE: Ah, young love.
SQUEELING GIRL: Did you hear? School's cancelled today because Kurt and Ram killed themselves in a repressed homosexual suicide pact.
HEATHER DUKE: ( incredulous, but amused ) No way!
VERONICA: ( looking to her burnt hand ) Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
MR. KELLY: If there's any way you can hear me, Kurt buddy, I don't care that you really were some pansy. You're my flesh-and-blood. You made me proud. I love my homosexual son. My son's gay and I love him!
VERONICA: Your son's dead and you love him.
MOM: How was the funeral?
VERONICA: ( deadpan )
VERONICA: That's three things.
VERONICA: No, it's okay J.D., I just kind of wanted to talk...Oh, a newsmagazine show on Channel 16. Really? On the suicides. No, sounds great. Bye.
THE CAFETERIA: STUDENTS eat and buzz together in typical cacophony. All are wearing black armbands. A jukebox roars. PAULINE FLEMING and an entourage of STUDENTS such as PETER DAWSON and the HEATHERS invade the cafeteria, heads raised high.
PAULINE: Peter, kill the jukebox.
PAULINE: Could I have your attention?
PAULINE: Our school has been torn apart by tragedy. I'm here today to fuse it back together through love! I want everyone to clasp hands. We need to connect this cafeteria into one mighty circuit. Let's begin a new happiness!
THE CAFETERIA: PAULINE's Evita Peron-like composure is crumbling.
PAULINE: Yo, what's the problem? I know you know how to hold hands. Ring-around- the-rosy-a-pocketful-of-posy.Forget it! I'm just so thrilled to announce that Whitney James of WETC News is taping a rap session with students from area high schools including Westerburg.
PAULINE: Let's show the world Westerburg is a diverse happy home, not Suicide Central! You know there's some people who say Westerburg is too weak and wimpy a school to be on T.V. Is that true?
PAULINE: No or Hell No?
STUDENTS: ( louder ) Hell no!
PAULINE: I can't hear you..
STUDENTS: HELL NO!
HELL NO!: As a blown away VERONICA takes in the panorama of students from different cliques chanting to the beat of PAULINE's gospel recital, PAULINE's voice is replaced on the soundtrack by the evocative female moanings of the opening scene. J.D., also wearing a black armband, stalks VERONICA from behind. His hand unzips her dress. The female voices swell louder as a glowing VERONICA takes in glorious images. Geek BRACES and a JOCK chant together, standing on chairs. HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEAVY METALER MATT look to each other dubiously then mindlessly shout out. A MORRISONESQUE STONER dances on a table of cheering BETTY-FINN-A-LIKES. J.D. slides his hand through the opening in Veronica's dress. The female voices cut off as the spell over VERONICA breaks. She swings her elbow into J.D.'s stomach.
VERONICA: Can't you see this is a special moment?
PAULINE: You people are in charge of getting delegates from every clique in the school to be on the Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special. Let's be able to say we were the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture.
PETER: Westerburg? A happy family?
PAULINE: I'm sure you'll work something out.
HEATHER DUKE: ( wickedly ) Don't worry. We'll work something out.
VERONICA: Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?.J.D.?
VERONICA: You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
VERONICA: J.D. comically cups his hands together to holler.
VERONICA: You can be so immature!
FRED DEAN: We beat the bitches.
VERONICA: ( mumbling ) Oh beautiful. The Beaver's home.
FRED DEAN: Judge told em to slurp shit and die.
FRED DEAN: I put a Norwegian in the boiler room. Masterful. When that blew, it set off a pack of thermals I'd stuck upstairs.
FRED DEAN: It's great to be alive!
VERONICA: Do you like your father?
VERONICA: Let's just.settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for.
VERONICA: J.D. exhales in frustration and changes some more channels.
BIGFUN: TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT! TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
VERONICA: We're breaking up. I am out!
VERONICA: You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
VERONICA: I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase..
HEATHER DUKE: What the...
HEATHER DUKE: ( trying to stay clam ) Where did you get these?
HEATHER DUKE: What do you want from me?
HEATHER DUKE: But she couldn't handle it.
HEATHER DUKE: Very very. The photographs?
HALLWAY: HEATHER DUKE bursts through the bathroom door to wickedly strut down the hall. She scowls/smiles in perfect Heather Chandler fashion to various passers-by.
EARL: Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
VERONICA: ( chuckling ) Something like that. Will you do it?
EARL: Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
VERONICA: I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
EARL: I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.
VERONICA: Things are going to change, Earl.
EARL: HEATHER DUKE impishly blinds VERONICA with her hands.
HEATHER DUKE: Guess who?
VERONICA: HEATHER DUKE lets go with a small giggle. VERONICA turns to face her Heather Chandler-looking friend and her smile dies. VERONICA violently pushes HEATHER DUKE away and storms off.
VERONICA: Ouch. Your machine's got the most obnoxious beep. Heather, I'm sorry.
DAVID: Hey Veronica Sawyer, barf on anybody's carpet lately?
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: VERONICA cringes.
VERONICA: Is this David? Heather's David? What are you doing..
DAVID: What can I say? I was pretty broken up by Heather C.'s suicide. I needed somebody super-sensitive like Heather D.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: I'm delirious for the both of you. Can you put Heather on?
VERONICA: I'm delirious for the both of you. Can you put Heather on?
DAVID: She can't really talk right now.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: VERONICA slams down the receiver and pulls up a sleek leather address book. She severely scans through it. Tossing it away, VERONICA then descends into the sundry junk of her night table drawer and draws up another address book; this one is frayed and pink polka-dotted. She peruses it and dials...
VERONICA: Hello, Betty...
BETTY: I don't believe it. I'm winning.
VERONICA: Don't get cocky, girl.
BETTY: I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
VERONICA: That's bullshit. Just shoot.
BETTY: Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
VERONICA: ( warmly )
VERONICA: Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
BETTY: VEONCIA gigglingly shoots, but misses the wicket. And instead hits BETTY's ball. Disturbed by the sudden dilemma, she determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from BETTY's.
BETTY: Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
VERONICA: It's not my style, okay?
BETTY: Nice guys finish last. I should know.
HEATHER DUKE: BETTY FINN ( nervously )
BETTY FINN: ( nervously ) I've got to get going, Veronica. See you at the studio.
VERONICA: Sure. See ya.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Croquet won't be the same without Heather.
HEATHER DUKE: Oh Betty, wait. I almost forgot.The Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special isn't going to be taped at the studios. It's going to be done in the Park.
BETTY: But I thought.
HEATHER DUKE: ( heading back ) It's going to be like a big picnic. Bring some potato salad.HEY, I'M RED!
HEATHER MCNAMARA: So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
VERONICA: So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
HEATHER DUKE: Back off. I called everyone, even that Stoner slut. Felt like giving my phone a bath. I told Betty just now.Damn!
VERONICA: You're so polluted. Talking down to people, making fake notes..
HEATHER DUKE: I don't see what gives you the right to lecture, Ronnie. You were soulmates with Betty Finn until you realized you're the cover of Seventeen magazine and she's the before half of a Scarsdale Diet ad.
HEATHER DUKE: Some people just don't matter. Why should those who do carry their weight? Am I right?
VERONICA: No, you're wrong. It's not even your turn.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: She's right...Boy, croquet's not the same without Heather.
VERONICA: Ich Luge bullets. I'm such a jerk.
PETER DAWSON: Veronica, I thought we lost you.
VERONICA: I was waiting for my friend Betty.
PETER DAWSON: Teens talking it out on T.V.! Would it be pretentious of me to attach a videocassette of the show on my Princeton application?
VERONICA: Shucks, that's a great idea, Pete. They burst through the studio double doors.
STUDIO: VERONICA and PETER take in a panorama of attractive, clean-cut STUDENTS from various schools chatting near Wine and Cheese tables set up to the side of an impressive, elevated, circular stage. All STUDENTS are wearing pink armbands.
PETER DAWSON: This is excellent, but I thought we were going to get equal representation on this thind: Geeks, Gearheads.
HEATHER DUKE: They're probably just being fashionably late.
HEATHER DUKE: Is this very or what? Oh, you've gotta meet Whitney James! Come on!
HEATHER DUKE: Whitney, here's my friend...
WHITNEY JAMES: Ah please sit down.
WHITNEY JAMES: I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
VERONICA: But my name's not.
WHITNEY JAMES: People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
VERONICA: I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
WHITNEY JAMES: Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
WHITNEY JAMES: I'm not knocking teen suicide. It's exciting stuff. My personal faves are those kids from loaded families grabbing the mike to whine how even though they bagged a B.M.W. on their birthday, they're still quote-unquote depressed. It's ridiculous. People who say money can't buy happiness don't know where to shop.
CLYDE: What the fuck?
NEWS SET: Completely flabbergasted, VERONICA manages a light tone.
VERONICA: The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
WHITNEY JAMES: Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
VERONICA: It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
WHITNEY JAMES: Sure. Ciao.
STUDIO FLOOR: Sickened, VERONICA stumbles onto the studio floor. Studio lights suddenly pop on, momentarily blinding her. PAULINE grabs VERONICA by the arm and shouts into the air.
PAULINE: Everyone take their places on the stage! Isn't this thrilling?!
VERONICA: But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
PAULINE: What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch. Could we get some more light up here?
THE STAGE: The pink armbanded Aryan youths form a circle on the circular stage. Pauline moves to a microphone at the center stage beside a seated WHITNEY JAMES who's tuning her electric guitar. VERONICA helplessly stands between the circle of STUDENTS and the two female hosts as the cameras go on. PAULINE sings/speaks into the microphone while WHITNEY JAMES strums her guitar.
PAULINE: Our schools have been torn apart by tragedy. Let's fuse them back together through love. Let's clasp hands and connect ourselves in one mighty circuit like a dove.
PAULINE: .with no more suicide.
STUDENTS: ( eeriely ) Oh yeah.
PAULINE: No more problems..
VERONICA: Oh yeah.
WHITNEY JAMES: Let's go for another take.
GRAVELLY ROAD: She sprints down the side of a road. Her bare feet pound against sharp pebbles.
PROMENADE: VERONICA speeds past the shops and the movie theatre. The viewer remains at the theatre ticket booth as MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK wearing a BIGFUN T-shirt, pushes three dollars through the ticket window to a bored female cashier.
CASHIER: Bargain matinees are for the first show only.
MARTHA: Oh, I forgot.
DAD: Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
VERONICA: Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
MOM: I don't know about, honey, but can it wait a bit. We're watching this special program on Teen Problems.
MOM: Turn that back on!
VERONICA: This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
DAD: If we're not going to watch that program, can I put on the game?
MOM: Are you trying to tell me it is a troubled time for the nation's youth?
VERONICA: Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
MOM: I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
VERONICA: All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.
DAD: I don't patronize bunny rabbits.
MOM: Treated like human beings? Is that what you said little Miss Voice of a Generation? Just how do you think adults act with other adults? You think it's all just Doubles Tennis. Adults can be horrible to other adults. When teenagers complain that they want to be treated like human beings, it's usually because they are being treated like human beings.
VERONICA: I guess I picked the wrong time to be a human being.
MOM: You'll live. Want some pate?
HEATHER DUKE: Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
VERONICA: ( repulsed ) Is she dead?
HEATHER DUKE: That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
VERONICA: I said I was sorry.
HEATHER DUKE: You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
VERONICA: You're not funny. Ouch!
HEATHER DUKE: ( Heather Chandleresque ) What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
VERONICA: Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
HEATHER DUKE: Oh shit, yeah. I know it's supposed to be funny that they never get off the island, but still, sometimes I feel like I'm on that island and Gilligan can be just so stupid sometimes.
HEATHER DUKE: This sounds like a good one.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: My name is Heather, I mean, not Heather.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: It's Madonna. Geez, no, not that.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: VERONICA and HEATHER DUKE simultaneously move into stunned kneeling positions, half-realizing who the caller is.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: God has cursed me, I think. The last time I had sex, the guy killed himself the next day. I'm failing Math.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: HEATHER DUKE excitedlly jumps up as HEATHER MCNAMARA drones on.
GRUFF TEACHER: Where's Heather going?
HEATHER DUKE: She's going to
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Fucking child protector caps.
GRUFF TEACHER: Now where's she going? Is somebody getting raped today on All My Children or what?
GIRLS BATHROOM: The bottle is smashed open. A palmful of pills is poured out.
HALLWAY: VERONICA races down the hall.
GIRLS BATHROOM: HEATHER MCNAMARA is a chipmunk with a mouthful of pills. She pulls a glass from her purse and turns on a faucet, but no water comes out. She manages to mumble.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Give me a break.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: What are you trying to do? Kill me?
VERONICA: What were
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Suicide is a private thing.
VERONICA: You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
VERONICA: If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
VERONICA: Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
VERONICA: INT. THE EMPTY CLASSROOMDAY Comfortably slouched at a desk, J.D. laconically rumbles.
HEATHER DUKE: TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT! Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
HEATHER DUKE: I'll get right on it coach. And hey, a little gift. I won't be needing it.
COURTNEY: Oh great. Here comes Heather.
COURTNEY'S FRIEND: INT. SCHOOL BUSDAY HEATHER DUKE chirps to a schoolbusful of various STUDENTS.
STAIRCASE WINDOW: HEATHER DUKE continues to bizarrely bathe in the sunlight of the staircase window.
HEATHER DUKE: Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten everyone to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me! My God, you haven't signed!
VERONICA: People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton.
HEATHER DUKE: ( verbally winking ) So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others.. ( happiness evaporating ) Hey, just sign the petition!
VERONICA: Don't talk to me like that.
HEATHER DUKE: It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
VERONICA: ( queasy ) Jealous much?
HEATHER DUKE: Jealous much?
VERONICA: Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
HEATHER DUKE: Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made her Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
VERONICA: ( jokingly but caustically ) I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
VERONICA: It's over, J.D. Over!
VERONICA: MOM and DAD glance at each other before MOM speaks.
MOM: Your friend Jason Dean just stopped by. He seemed very concerned about you. He said he thinks you might try to kill yourself.
DAD: he said this is for you.
VERONICA: Oh my God..
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: VERONICA vaults through her bedroom door. A Barbie doll wearing a BigFun T-shirt hangs from a noose. With a whimper, she swerves away from it and dives onto her bed.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: VERONICA curls into a fetal position on her bed and closes her eyes...tighter and tighter as J.D.'s voice.
VERONICA: Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
VERONICA: Wait a..You're not listening! I'm not on your side..
VERONICA: You're still not listening! I'm not..
VERONICA: ( taking the knife from him ) This knife is filthy.
VERONICA: I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
VERONICA: Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me. Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
VERONICA: J.D. hops in the adjoinging room and slams the door. VERONICA races to the door wailing. She maniacally rattles the doorknob trying to open the locked door.
FATHER RIPPER: FATHER RIPPER lets the word hang in the air, then holds up the copy of The Catcher in the Rye.
FATHER RIPPER: Heather Duke underlined a lot of things in this copy of The Catcher in the Rye, but I believe the word Eskimo, underlined all by itself is the key to understanding Heather's pain.
FATHER RIPPER: On the surface, Heather Duke was the vivacious young lady we all knew her to be. But her soul was in Antartica, freezing with the knowledge of the way fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way parents can be unresponsive, and as she writes so eloquently in her suicide note, the way life can suck. We'll all miss Sherwood's little Eskimo. Let's hope she's rubbing noses with Jesus.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Is this turnout weak or what? I had at least seventy more people at my funeral.
VERONICA: Heather? Wha.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time.
VERONICA: What are you doing here?!
HEATHER CHANDLER: I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
HEATHER CHANDLER: INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOMNIGHT Uncurling from the fetal position that she had fallen asleep in, VERONICA's tightly closed eyes snap open in a sweat as her mother's voice continues to filter through the door. It's all been a dream.....
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: VERONICA hugs J.F.K. the cat then rips down the hanging Barbie.
MOM: Does she want a written invitation? Veronica! Dinner!
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: J.D. crawls through VERONICA's window. Hanging from the rafter, neck in a noose of bedshoots, is VERONICA.
MOM: VERONICA'S BEDROOM J.D. paces the room, sweating and ranting, waving a gun in one hand, the Barbie doll in the other.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM: J.D. paces the room, sweating and ranting, waving a gun in one hand, the Barbie doll in the other.
MOM: Oh God, I knew it! No, no! I want my baby back! I should have let you keep that job at the mall. I was just afraid of you coming home alone at night!
MOM: I made your favorite! Spaghetti! Lots of oregano!
VERONICA: Hey Mom, why so tense?
PAULINE: Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
VERONICA: Where is he? Where's J.D.?
PAULINE: We have to talk. Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
VERONICA: Get a job.
BOYS BATHROOM: J.D smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door. He turns off his Walkman and ends the Montage music.
THE HALLWAY: The hallway slowly clears as STUDENTS go to class. The bell rings. A LATE STUDENT races through the empty hallway. VERONICA carefully hatches out of her locker. She treads down the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her.
THE GYM: A group of cheerleaders including HEATHER MCNAMARA are lazily doing cartwheels on the gym floor. On a small stage set up beside them, other STUDENTS are putting up folding chairs. PRINCIPAL GOWAN says "Testing" into a microphone. J.D., toting the gym bag, quietly opens the gym door and slips inside. He swiftly moves unnoticed to a position underneath the bleachers.
THE HALLWAY: VERONICA peers around a corner to see an empty hallway.
VERONICA: Rodney, where's everybody going?
RODNEY: It's Friday...
VERONICA: Oh my God, the damn pep assembly..
RODNEY: Yeah, these things are pretty artificial, but at least we all get out of class.
THE GYM: J.D. darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors. He pops the doors open and sees the crowd of STUDENTS move toward the gym. He suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby set of stairs.
VERONICA: Rodney, what's underneath the gym?
RODNEY: The boiler room.
VERONICA: Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
VERONICA: Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
THE GYM: The pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy STUDENTS in the bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard. Various Jocks, including EARL, stand on the stage with PRINCIPAL GOWAN as a YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER flashes away.
VERONICA: The bomb's gone on, J.D.! How do you turn it off? Tell me!
VERONICA: It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
VERONICA: How do you turn the fucker off?
VERONICA: The bomb, asshole!
VERONICA: You know what I want, babe?
VERONICA: Cool guys like you out of my life.
VERONICA: But babe, don't worry, these here were Ich Luge bullets.
VERONICA: ( vertigo city ) I thought I.you..
VERONICA: J.D. raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks to 0:00. Nothing happens. An annoyed J.D. breaks out of his crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm.
HEATHER DUKE: Veronica, you look like hell.
VERONICA: Yeah, I just got back.
HEATHER DUKE: What are you doing?
VERONICA: Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
VERONICA: Hey, Martha, wait up.
VERONICA: My date for the prom kind of flaked out on me, so I thought if you weren't doing anything that night we could go to the video store and rent some new releases or something. Maybe pop some popcorn.
MARTHA: I'd like that.
VERONICA: So would I.
