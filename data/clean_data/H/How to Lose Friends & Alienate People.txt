REVERSE: A YOUNG BOY sits watching the film, his clothes and the room around him telling us this is England in the 1960s. He is staring raptly at the actress.
PR WOMAN: Babe Three. Yeah. She looks doubtfully at the pig.
SIDNEY: Babe Three. Yeah. She looks doubtfully at the pig.
PR WOMAN: Babe was a cute little piglet.
SIDNEY: Harry Potter used to be a cute little piglet too. What do you want? Tempus Fugits.
PR WOMAN: He hasn't got any ID.
SIDNEY: How many pigs are coming tonight? Look, I was told to bring him, hand him over to the producer, Bob Milton, inside. You want me to leave him here with you, that's fine.
PR WOMAN: No, you can't leave him with me. I've got.Hold on, I'll. She looks around, helplessly. She begins to unhook the red rope. Sidney tries to hide his excitement.
SIDNEY: ( RUMBLED )
SIDNEY: What about me?
HORRIFIED ): How much? I only want to stay for one night!
LATER: .as Sidney emerges from the washrooms, now dressed only in the white shirt and black trousers. He scoops up a passing glass of champagne, checks his moustache and surveys the courtyard - a room full of glamour: tanned skin, diamonds, beautiful dresses, beautiful suits, champagne. He stands surveying the crowd of A-list celebrities in front of him, dazed.
SIDNEY: ( TO HIMSELF )
SIDNEY: No, when I'm in L.A. I stay at the Sunset Marquis, when I'm here I always stay at the Sanderson. It's, you know, I don't feel at home these days unless I'm in a So what do you do?
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS: So what do you do?
SIDNEY: Oh, I'm a writer. Movie writer.
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS: Oh great.
SIDNEY: Yeah. Got one in pre-production now. You know it's really weird running into you like this because just the other day I was telling the producer I thought you'd be perfect for the lead. She starts to laugh.
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS: ( SMILING )
SIDNEY: Tits of Fury. She laughs.
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS: No. Have you?
SIDNEY: Me? No, hardly anything. A penis reduction as a child, that's pretty much. She laughs again, snorting into her drink. Sidney can't believe this - she likes him!
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS: Oh god, I'm drunk.
SIDNEY: Are you?
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS: I'm so drunk. I haven't eaten You feel okay? Because my room's just upstairs if you want to lie down or, or loosen any, you know, morals or.
SIDNEY: You feel okay? Because my room's just upstairs if you want to lie down or, or loosen any, you know, morals or.
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS: ( LAUGHING )
SIDNEY: Clark. Clark Baxter. He takes a sip of his champagne and his moustache comes loose and hangs limply from his face.
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS: ( FEARFULLY )
SIDNEY: Oh, shit! Sidney turns and legs it.
SIDNEY: ( CALLING ) 18 LIVING ROOM 18
JOURNALIST: Look, we don't hate celebrities at the Post-Modern Review, okay? We just don't think they should be taking themselves so seriously. For us a celebrity is a text to be deconstructed. Apart from Costner obviously. Sidney edges past him to where a LARGE WOMAN and a histrionic THIN MAN are in the middle of a argument, encouraged by the other members of staff.
THIN MAN: ( SHRILL )

SIDNEY: ( threading his way past ) Couldn't one of you answer the As the argument continues behind him he reaches the phone with a bored YOUNG MAN sitting by it.
YOUNG MAN: You don't pay me.
SIDNEY: Just get the phone! The Young Man answers the phone.
YOUNG MAN: Post-Modern Review.
THIN MAN: Sidney, if she doesn't apologise I'm quitting.
SIDNEY: ( to the Large Woman ) George can't leave. You'll have to apologise.
LARGE WOMAN: Why can't George leave?
SIDNEY: He owns the fax machine. Sidney notices the Young Man is staring at him with a scared expression.
YOUNG MAN: It's Sharps Magazine. Sidney stops smiling.
SIDNEY: We're not finished.
YOUNG MAN: They sue, we're finished.
SIDNEY: Shut up. ( To the others ) Will you be quiet! They ignore him and continue bickering. Sidney picks up the Sidney Young.
VOICED ): This is Clayton Harding. I'm the editor of Sharps Magazine. Sidney is visibly thrown.
SIDNEY: Ah, Lord Vader.
CLAYTON HARDING: I saw you at my party, just before you ruined it with your little pig stunt.
CLAYTON HARDING: On his desk we see a few copies the Post-Modern Review - glimpses of stars on the covers - Catherine Zeta-Jones, Orlando Bloom. Clayton's hand sifts one copy from the others and holds it up - the cover depicts CLAYTON HIMSELF - patrician handsome, stern, photo-shopped so that he appears to be NAKED. A headline reads "Clayton Harding - The Editor's New Clothes? Clayton's shoulder's heave with a snort of repressed CLAYTON HARDING ( CONT'D ) ( examining the cover ) I especially liked the part where Clint Eastwood beat the shit outa 20 INT.

Well, it doesn't, Mr. 21 INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 21 Clayton is still flicking through the magazines.
CLAYTON HARDING: SIDNEY ( O.S. ) "Mr. Potter."You go ahead and sue if you want, but I warn you, if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. An ASSISTANT walks in. Clayton looks up.

SIDNEY: ( eyeing her chest
DOUBTFULLY ): Well, I think it depends on the breasts but.
MRS KOWALSKI: ( OBLIVIOUS )
SIDNEY: Yeah, they don't make entertainers like that any Mrs Kowalski cuffs the back of his head. Sidney is somewhat surprised by this familiarity, having only just met the lady. She opens an apartment door.
MRS KOWALSKI: They brought your things Yup, this is good. This is.I can put my drum kit just over there and, uh. She stares at him.
SIDNEY: ( LOOKING AROUND )

SEXY WOMAN: ( TO BARMAN )
SIDNEY: ( raising his glass ) Hi, my name's Clark. Clark The Woman looks at him without expression. Sidney sips his drink, grimaces.
BARMAN: That's a water sir.
SIDNEY: Well that's.that's not right, is it? That's not.put a dash of beer in that. A young woman has been sitting on the other side of Sidney. This is ALISON OLSEN ( 20s ) smart, attractive, dressed in an elegant but no-nonsense suit. She is writing in a NOTEBOOK. She looks up and notices Sidney.
ALISON: I'm sorry, my boyfriend's sitting Sidney gets up and examines the stool.
SIDNEY: Is he? He's fucking small isn't He smiles at the Sexy Woman, hoping to get a laugh. Alison examines Sidney coolly, points to the drink on the bar in front of Sidney.
ALISON: That's his White Russian. He'll be here in a second.
SIDNEY: ( TO BARMAN )
BARMAN: Sidney sits down and turns back to the Sexy Woman.
SIDNEY: I'm a journalist. Work for a little periodical you might have heard of called Sharps Magazine? Sidney produces a card and waves it vaguely.
ALISON: ( to Sexy Woman ) This is a library card. ( Reading it ) From Glow-cester.
SIDNEY: ( snatching it back ) That's.not that one. ( Searching wallet ) I've got it somewhere.I just. The Sexy Woman gets up and walks away. Sidney watches her go bitterly.
ALISON: Just doing my bit for the gene He produces the PHOTOGRAPH of him being held in a headlock by Clint Eastwood.
SIDNEY: Who's that there with Clint Morgan Freeman?
ALISON: Morgan Freeman?
SIDNEY: No, in the headlock.
ALISON: You had this laminated?
SIDNEY: Oh just give it. He snatches the photograph back, catching Alison's glass in the process. Her drink SPILLS over her notebook - soaking the page she has been writing.
ALISON: It's okay. It's okay. I've got He tries to blot the page with a napkin, smearing the ink.

SIDNEY: ( to the newcomer ) He slides the PHOTOGRAPH over to her.
WOMAN: I'm gonna powder my nose. Why don't you put on something a little more romantic? She staggers off down the hall. Sidney, giddy with excitement, searches through some LPs and puts one on his old turntable. It's Ace of Spades by Motorhead. He staggers around, playing air-guitar for a moment.
SIDNEY: Mrs Lebowski.
MRS KOWALSKI: Kowalski. You know what time it is? The music blaring, your door ( trying to seem sober ) Was it? Fuck. I mean, shit. Sorry. I just.met an old friend and brought them back. The Woman staggers back into the room, her back to us. She is NAKED. She is also surprisingly muscular.

SIDNEY: You can do this! You can do this! He hums the fanfare from the Rocky theme.
SIDNEY: Quick coffee Bob and then you've got to go.
CLAYTON HARDING: What the fuck are you wearing? The song grinds to an abrupt halt. Sidney loses a quantity of swagger. He examines his T-shirt.
SIDNEY: You like it? I brought you one. He takes a T-shirt from his satchel and hands it to Casually he flings the shirt out of the open window behind CLAYTON HARDING ( CONT'D ) Next time you come here dressed like that, you follow the shirt. You understand? Sidney nods dumbly.
CLAYTON HARDING: Casually he flings the shirt out of the open window behind Sidney nods dumbly.

CLAYTON HARDING: Oh, I thought it was.kinda snarky. And bitter. And. Sidney digests this. Clayton seems lost in thought. CLAYTON HARDING ( CONT'D ) I'm going to try you out in the I Spy Section.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: ( glancing at Sidney's
CLOTHES ): Well, Sidney. We've only just met but already I perceive I am in the presence of a rare comic I know your Hi-jinx gave you a certain notoriety back in Olde England but things are going to be a bit different here. Harding wants me to be your Rabbi, show you the ropes. Are you aware of what we do at I Spy?

LAWRENCE MADDOX: This isn't a vacation. It's a Maddox sweeps around the corner into an open-plan office area. Fact-checkers and Assistants buzz around.
SIDNEY: Okay. What do you mean by Maddox gestures at Sidney's body.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Something that covers all of this He starts to check messages on his desk. Sidney, trying to seem at ease, stares at a black and white PHOTOGRAPH on the Is that Mussolini?
SIDNEY: Is that Mussolini?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: ( Beat. ) ) No, Sidney, that's Richard Heywood. The owner of this Oh. Looks a little like, uh.( pointing to the child in the photograph, smiling ) Who's this funny looking kid? Is that his son? Maddox stares at him.

ALISON: I hear the Cultural Editor's job is up for grabs?
SIDNEY: Listen, seeing as how I'm going to be sitting just over there, don't you think we should try and put last night behind us?
ALISON: No. Get off my desk.
SIDNEY: I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing. ( Beat ) Are you going to help me out?
ALISON: Okay. Which way did you come in? Sidney stares at her. Alison takes some contact sheets from her desk and shoves them at him.
INGRID: ( TO ALISON )
ALISON: Hi, Ingrid. Ingrid stares at Sidney's outfit, thrown.
SIDNEY: ( a wolfish smile ) You going to introduce me?
ALISON: This is Clark Baxter. ( Noticing Ingrid's gaze ) He's English.

CUT TO: 42 INT. LOBBY - LIFT - DAY 42
SIDNEY: It's fashion sensitive. If you're not wearing Prada it'll take your arm clean off. Anna stares at this strange man with the burger, baffled.
ANNA: But I am wearing Prada. The lift stops and she gets out. Alison gets in, sees Sidney and winces. She takes out a book and pretends to read. The lift begins to rise again. Through it's glass doors we see the different floors passing, different publications - each a hive of sober, hard work. Sidney stares at them.
SIDNEY: ( MOUTH FULL )
ALISON: What did you expect?
SIDNEY: I don't know. The Algonquin circle. Dorothy Parker. Martinis. Quips. Look at them. Not one of them is drunk.
ALISON: It's called being a professional. You should try it some time.
SIDNEY: There's something you should understand. I'm not really one of By "you" do you mean "human?"
ALISON: By "you" do you mean "human?"
SIDNEY: I mean the glossy posse. Bunch of Zombies, writing about "Pets of the Stars" but acting like they're working for the UN. I'm here to shake things up a bit. Where are you from?
ALISON: Not that it's any of your business, but I'm from Port Huron, Michigan.
SIDNEY: Right. Small town girl. ( Hannibal Lector impersonation ) I bet you could only dream of getting out. Getting anywhere - yes, Clarice? Getting all the way - to the N.Y.C. ( Dropping the impersonation ) Take my advice, don't go taking this celebrity fluff seriously. For a moment Alison is speechless with anger.
ALISON: The lift stops and a TALL WOMAN enters. She is expensively dressed, wears Chanel dark glasses, an expression of granite and an air of superhuman froideur. Alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares tensely ahead. Only Sidney, busy chewing, is oblivious to the plunge in temperature. For a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift. Then Sidney begins to choke on some burger. He wheezes for a moment, gagging. The Woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her. Alison closes her eyes. Sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back of the oblivious Woman's Prada jacket. Sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the offending item away. Before he can move Alison silently takes his wrist in a vice-like grip.
ALISON: ( HISSING )
SIDNEY: That was her? The Mussolini baby? He stops.
ALISON: No! Listen to me - you do NOT approach Elizabeth Maddox, you do NOT talk to her! Don't even make eye-contact with her? Do you Am I supposed to be afraid?
SIDNEY: Am I supposed to be afraid?
ALISON: I don't know the meaning of the word fear.
SIDNEY: I don't know the meaning of the word fear.
ALISON: I'm sure there are many words you don't know the meaning of! She walks on, shaking her head in disbelief.
SIDNEY: ( FOLLOWING HER )
ALISON: When Clayton left college he started this little magazine called Snipe. Fantastic. Took aim at every self-important celebrity in town. Completely fearless. It was like my magazine but twenty years earlier.

SIDNEY: Yeah, but don't worry. I think I might still be in time to save 44 INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - EVENING 44 The phone is ringing. Sidney walks in from the bedroom, changing into his old brown suit. The answer machine kicks SIDNEY ( O.S. ) ( over answer machine ) You've reached Sidney Young. I'm sorry but my answering machine is out of order, so the voice you are hearing is actually me. The machine BEEPS. Sidney smirks at his joke and is reaching for the phone when we hear the caller - an older man, an upper-class English accent.
SIDNEY: ( MOUTH FULL )
ALISON: Wall to wall what?
SIDNEY: Totty. Babes. Sexually attractive Do you mind?
ALISON: Do you mind?
SIDNEY: Maddox joins them. A man passes, nods respectfully at Look at that. All night people have been treating us like we're royalty. In London, the journalist's motto is "Everybody hates us and we don't care."
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Well, now you're one of the High Priests of what's Hot and what's Not. So what were you two talking Sidney was just marvelling at the abundance of "Totty" here.
ALISON: Sidney was just marvelling at the abundance of "Totty" here.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: ( ENJOYING THIS )
SIDNEY: I shouldn't be here. I get thrown out of places like this.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: This? This is a McDonald's. I hate disease parties. ( Off Sidney's puzzled look ) Fund- Someone's CELL PHONE RINGS. All of the guests automatically check their cells. An OLDER ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walks over - she's a little Lawrence Maddox? Oh my goodness. Long time. Maddox examines her coolly.
WOMAN: Lawrence Maddox? Oh my goodness. Long time. Maddox examines her coolly.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Rachel. How are you?
RACHEL: Well, I'm just wonderful. Wonderful. How are you? Lawrence smiles and looks around him without answering. Rachel tries again.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: ( SMOOTHLY )
SIDNEY: ( TO MADDOX )
LAWRENCE MADDOX: ( COOLLY )
SIDNEY: Seriously, I've heard about that film. I think she's going to make a come back. We should get there first, do a profile or something before everyone else. Maddox isn't listening. Instead he greets a fat, angry- looking VERY YOUNG MAN. This is VINCENT LEPAK, wearing his customary SHADES.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: ( FAWNING )
VINCENT: I think this is the worst fundraiser I've been to in my whole life.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: It's a rat fuck, isn't it? Sidney walks away.
SIDNEY: Excuse me? Aren't you Rachel Rachel turns to look at him.
RACHEL: ( HARD )
SIDNEY: Absolutely. I must have seen everything you've been in. Those episodes of The Love Boat and the Bionic Woman? The Song Birds, In The Night.I've even seen your first ever TV appearance. The Twilight Zone - House of Mirrors. My all time favorite? A Day Too Long. ( He means it ) You were really great in that. Rachel stares at him. She hides her emotion with a bright What's your name, honey?
RACHEL: ( THROWN ) ( LAUGHING )
SIDNEY: My all time favorite? A Day Too Long. ( He means it ) You were really great in that. Rachel stares at him. She hides her emotion with a bright What's your name, honey?
RACHEL: ( LAUGHING )
SIDNEY: Sidney Young. She takes the napkin and pen, her face glowing.
RACHEL: ( WRITING )
VINCENT: You look around and it's all shit. No-one is making movies that are fucking worthwhile.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: I'd have to disagree with you, Vincent looks at him, displeased.
VINCENT: This is what I'm saying. You have to inspire yourself. I am my role- model. I want to be me. He stares angrily around, handing his empty glass to his waiting assistant who immediately replaces it with a full one from a passing tray. Sidney watches him with dislike.
SIDNEY: ( SUDDENLY )
VINCENT: Excuse me?
SIDNEY: What's the greatest film ever made? ( To Alison ) Go on. Have a Well, that's.I don't think there is one single film that.
ALISON: ( IRRITATED )

It's a The group study him, trying to work out if this is irony or idiocy. Maddox is staring daggers at him. An extremely thin, fashionably dressed woman smiles at Sidney.
WOMAN: I don't think we've been Mister Young, this is Eleanor Johnson, Queen of New York. Eleanor this is Sidney Young. He's from England and he's our very own Idiot Savant. Without the Savant.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Mister Young, this is Eleanor Johnson, Queen of New York. Eleanor this is Sidney Young. He's from England and he's our very own Idiot Savant. Without the Savant.
ELEANOR JOHNSON: Well, it's always nice to have fresh blood at these things. ( To Maddox ) Which reminds me, I'm here with Sophie Maes, I want you to meet her. New film, The Suffragette coming out, the buzz is A-mazing. The release is tied in with the roll-out of the Reebok campaign, and now Louis Vuitton's on the line. This train is leaving the station Lawrence.
SIDNEY: ( TO ELEANOR )
ELEANOR JOHNSON: I don't really like that word, What should I call you?
SIDNEY: What should I call you?
ELEANOR JOHNSON: You can call me Eleanor. She stares past him, across the pool.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: ( MURMURING )
ELEANOR JOHNSON: ( on cell phone ) Where's the car? What's it doing at the back? Forget what I said. I want the car at the front. Now. Sidney finds himself walking alongside Sophie and Maddox, trying not to stare at Sophie's breasts.
SOPHIE MAES: .I just think it's terrible the way we're still exploiting animals. That's why, you know, I won't wear fur or leather, I won't wear make-up, I'm I'm with you.
SIDNEY: I'm with you.

ALISON: ( TIGHT )
SOPHIE: Aren't you cold?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: I'm from Canada, land of ice and They get into the car. Sidney tries to follow them.
SIDNEY: Budge up.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Where are you going?
SIDNEY: I'm coming to the club.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Sorry, you're not on the list. A small CHIHUAHUA - CUBA - on Sophie's lap snarls at LAWRENCE MADDOX ( CONT'D ) See? Even Cuba says so. Maddox closes the door and the car glides away, Sophie kissing the dog on the nose. The Paparazzi hurry back to the entrance as another celebrity emerges, leaving Alison and Sidney staring after the car.
SIDNEY: ( FUMING )
ALISON: ( IRRITATED )
SIDNEY: Yes he is. I started producing sperm when I was thirteen, so you know, technically.
ALISON: For your information he wasn't pawing her! He was just doing his job! In case you haven't noticed Sharps has to have a star on the cover every month. And most of those stars are clients of Eleanor's. So do not piss her She's a flak. Hacks don't take orders from flaks. And I don't think you can call that "doing his job." The man had no blood left in his upper body.
SIDNEY: She's a flak. Hacks don't take orders from flaks. And I don't think you can call that "doing his job." The man had no blood left in his upper body.
ALISON: ( SNAPPING )
SIDNEY: I wasn't being ironic.
ALISON: .would you mind not involving me, especially in the presence of Vincent Lepak who happens to be very important.
SIDNEY: Yeah, I could tell by the way he was allowed to stay up past his bed time. The car disappears into the distance. They watch it go.
ALISON: Sophie Maes. You think she'll go out with me?
SIDNEY: Sophie Maes. You think she'll go out with me?
ALISON: No. Girls like Sophie don't date journalists. As far as she's concerned, you're the help.
SIDNEY: What do you know? A lot of these starlets are lonely. They spend their time looking for a man. Alison starts to walk away.
ALISON: This is New York, Sidney. Women only date men who are I'm going to be successful.
SIDNEY: I'm going to be successful.
ALISON: ( as she goes ) .and tall.
SIDNEY: Have you seen this? She's An ASSISTANT walks over with a MUFFIN BASKET for Maddox.
ASSISTANT: From Sophie Maes.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: ( reading the card ) "Thanks for a great night." What a sweet kid. Oh, Sidney, about last night - word of advice. Don't talk to the celebrities, okay? Sophie said you made her feel uncomfortable. He walks off with a slight smirk. Sidney glowers after him.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: .so Brad's people finally got back to me and they've agreed. We've got the whole afternoon, before the shoot. People clap. Harding nods approvingly.
CLAYTON HARDING: Good work Lawrence. Okay, well, if that's it for. He starts to get up.
SIDNEY: So, I was thinking, Clay. Clayton, pauses, frowning. Sidney turns to the room, Paris Hilton. I do a profile on her as if she's this complete recluse, this hermit.( laughing ) I try and track her down and, you know, "Who is the elusive Paris Hilton and why is she so publicity shy?" He laughs for a moment. No one joins in.
CLAYTON HARDING: That's first room stuff, Sidney. And call me Clay one more time and see what happens. Harding stalks out of the room. Blushing, Sidney stares after him, nodding vaguely. As he gathers his notebook he becomes aware of the smirks on the faces of Maddox and the others as they leave.
VICKY: No, I'd love these but I'm so fat I couldn't.
INGRID: Get out of here!
ANNA: You look totally rexy.

ALISON: ( another tight smile ) No, thanks. She looks up as Sidney sits heavily beside her, stares at her with puppy-dog eyes. Alison tries to ignore him for a I don't mean to be rude Sidney but.what the fuck do you want?
SIDNEY: Listen, you know how things work around here. How am I going to get something in the magazine? Alison stares at him.
ALISON: I thought all this "fluff" was beneath you?
SIDNEY: It is but.things have changed.
ALISON: What's changed?
SIDNEY: Look, I know people think I'm a bit of an idiot and maybe I haven't started off too well here, but I want.I want. He seems so awkward that Alison begins to soften a little.
ALISON: You're loathsome, you know that?
SIDNEY: ( OBLIVIOUS )
ALISON: Like ring-worm. She gets up and stalks out. Sidney glances through the glass partition and sees MADDOX walking past.
SIDNEY: ( TO HIMSELF )
SIDNEY: Okay. Celebrity Trash Cans. The contents of celebrity trash cans are revealed and readers have gotta guess who the trash belongs to. Five bottles of Jack Daniels, a court order, and a copy of Mein Kampf? Mel Gibson!
CLAYTON HARDING: ( getting out the lift ) First Room, Sidney. First room.
SIDNEY: ( pointing at the snap ) Guess who that is with Clint Morgan Freeman?
MODEL: Morgan Freeman?
SIDNEY: No, not.why's everyone say.? There! In the head-lock!
SIDNEY: It's a Shag Tree. It illustrates all of the sexual pairings of Hollywood's top stars and how they interconnect. From under the door slides a piece of paper on which is written First Room. We hear a TOILET FLUSH.
CLAYTON HARDING: If I give you an interview will ya leave me the fuck alone? Sidney smiles. The song ends.
NATHAN LANE: Nathan Lane. Nice to meet you.

NATHAN LANE: Which is fine, but today, I think it would be great to get behind the mask.
SIDNEY: Which is fine, but today, I think it would be great to get behind the mask.
NATHAN LANE: ( BEAT )
SIDNEY: Absolutely. Of course. So, first question - are you Jewish? Nathan stares at Sidney.
NATHAN LANE: I don't see what the relevance of that is.
SIDNEY: Okay. Next question. The rat thing - that's gotta be Disney's first gay animal, right? So, I was wondering - are you a Beat. Nathan looks like he might hit Sidney.

SIDNEY: I was just trying to.probe.
CLAYTON HARDING: You wanna probe become a proctologist, okay? You can't ask musical comedy stars whether they're Jewish or gay. From now on just assume they're all Jewish and all gay, okay?
SIDNEY: I'd like to apply for an American Express card please? ( Beat ) Hon. Sidney Young. ( Beat ) As in Honourable. H-O-N. ( Beat )It's a British title. Across the desk Alison watches him with contempt.

ALISON: What are you doing? You can't.! He jerks the window open and empties Cuba out of it, slamming it shut just as Sophie, Eleanor and Lawrence walk Alison, have you seen Cuba?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Alison, have you seen Cuba?
ALISON: ( BEWILDERED )
ELEANOR JOHNSON: ( SNAPPING )
ALISON: Uh.no. No idea. Sidney stares at her in amazement. Behind him Cuba's body appears at the window, rising into view on a WINDOW WASHING PLATFORM. A Window Washer, stands at the other end of the cradle, bobbing his head to the music in his headphones. Alison stares at the dog in horror while the others talk, Don't worry, he couldn't have got very far.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Don't worry, he couldn't have got very far.
SOPHIE MAES: ( WAILING )
SIDNEY: ( NERVOUSLY )
CLAYTON HARDING: Did they find that rat yet?

CLAYTON HARDING: I don't know. Thousand dollars a plate, all I could taste was ass. I'm kissing their ass, they're kissing my ass. ( Beat ) I get this dream sometimes. Someone's set fire to the building - Heywoods - Sharps magazine - the whole thing, it's going up in flames. My analyst thinks it's an anxiety dream. I never tell him how happy I am watching the fucker burn. Sidney isn't sure what to say. Finally.
SIDNEY: I want to do a story on Vincent Lepak. Not a puff-piece. Something funny, but with teeth. The kind of thing Snipe would have done. Everyone's treating him like he's a genius and he's an idiot. Clayton notices the CLOSET-DOOR beside him and opens it. He stares at the rows of blue shirts hanging in there. He takes an armful out and examines them.
CLAYTON HARDING: Look at these things. How'd I get a closet full of blue fucking Um.I don't know.
SIDNEY: Um.I don't know.
CLAYTON HARDING: I don't know either. This is an office for Christ's sake! Why've I even got a fucking closet? He drops the shirts.

SIDNEY: What's he do, the mystery guy? Is he a hack too?
ALISON: ( BEAT )
SIDNEY: Really? What's he look like?
ALISON: ( LAUGHING )

ALISON: He's very handsome, thank you.
SIDNEY: ( GLOOMILY )
ALISON: You know what I don't understand? You're desperate to get a story in the magazine - so why wouldn't you play ball with Eleanor, write the puff-piece?
SIDNEY: I resent being bribed to gush sycophantically about a star, okay? I choose to gush Alison stares at Sidney trying to figure him out.
ALISON: ( SMILING )
SIDNEY: ( EMBARRASSED )
CLAYTON HARDING: Which makes it.a half page left. Lawrence? Any ideas?

SIDNEY: Did you read my story on Vincent Clayton frowns down at some papers, feigning distraction.
CLAYTON HARDING: What? Oh, yeah. That's.that's not going to work. Sidney can't believe it. Clayton gets up to leave.
SIDNEY: Rachel Petkoff? One of your favourite actresses? You'd never fucking heard of her! That was my idea! Lawrence stops and turns back.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: So it was. You have any more good ideas don't forget to bring them to my new office. He is about to walk on but remembers something.
SIDNEY: ( LIVID )
LAWRENCE MADDOX: When I do it it's called flirting. When you do it it's called sexual harassment. Consider this an official warning. I won't tolerate sexist He walks off. Sidney glowers after him.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: I know that wasn't Greg's way of working but Greg isn't deputy editor any more. I am, and I'm making changes. There is a knock at the door and Sidney walks in with an attractive BLONDE WOMAN in a long coat and dark glasses.
SIDNEY: Uh, Lawrence? This lady's been looking for you?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: ( to the woman ) Can I help you?
WOMAN: Are you Lawrence Maddox? The new deputy editor?

LAWRENCE MADDOX: ( MYSTIFIED )
WOMAN: I'm your present. The Woman produces a Beat-Box from behind her back and switches it on. She drops her coat to reveal underwear and stockings underneath. Maddox stares in frozen horror as the STRIPPER dances over to him, removing her bra.
INGRID: Hey Mrs Harding. Two Impeccably-Dressed Little Girls follow Mrs Harding into the room.
MRS HARDING: ( to the Little Girls ) And this is the Fashion Department. [To Ingrid] Where's Mr Maddox now?
INGRID: Oh he's down the hall. Room 217.

SIDNEY: Oh God, this is.this is 77 INT. MADDOX'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 77 The Stripper, who we suddenly realise is BOB THE TRANSEXUAL in a blonde wig, whips off his/her panties. There is a collective gasp from the room. Sidney can't stop laughing. Suddenly he notices everyone in the room is now staring at the door. He turns to see Mrs Harding and her girls standing, shell-shocked, in the doorway. Alarmed, Sidney side-steps in towards Bob.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Hello, Mrs Harding. Girls.
CLAYTON HARDING: ( TO SIDNEY )

CLAYTON HARDING: ( SITTING DOWN )
SIDNEY: ( he can't help himself ) Looks like I was too late to save you after all. He walks out.
ALISON: You hired a stripper?

SIDNEY: ( IRRITATED ) RICHARD YOUNG
RICHARD YOUNG: It was just a joke Sidney.
SIDNEY: Actually it's not. Because you're saying that what I do for a living is worthless and.
RICHARD YOUNG: I don't think it's worthless. I just think, in your heart, you know you could do more with your life than.
SIDNEY: ( ANGRY )
RICHARD YOUNG: I don't know who.
SIDNEY: I KNOW you don't know who that is! You don't know who anyone is! You thought Brad Pitt was a cave in Yorkshire! But most people do know who they are, okay? And most people wouldn't think that a journalist who gets to mix with stars like that was a, a I don't think you're a disappointment Sidney. I've never thought that. Silence.

RICHARD YOUNG: ( SMILING )
SIDNEY: She doesn't feel that way about me. New York women don't date I suppose not. But Alison is from Port Huron, isn't she? Sidney stares at him.
RICHARD YOUNG: ( SMILING )
ALISON: I don't remember very much but I'm so, so sorry. I'll get myself together and get going.
SIDNEY: Why? No, you're all right. It's.it's nice to have the Oh God.your father. And that Mrs Kowalski? Don't worry about it. The last woman she caught me with had a penis, so you know.you're a big step up.
ALISON: ( REMEMBERING )
SIDNEY: Mrs Kowalski? Don't worry about it. The last woman she caught me with had a penis, so you know.you're a big step up.
ALISON: She notices a black and white photograph of a glamorous WOMAN on the shelf. We recognise her as the woman on the TV at the beginning of the film.
SIDNEY: ( BEAT )
ALISON: No way!
SIDNEY: Yeah, I don't take after her.
ALISON: Was she a model?
SIDNEY: Wow. Movies?
ALISON: Wow. Movies?
SIDNEY: Some. British, small parts.
ALISON: Is she.
SIDNEY: No, she died when I was young. Without thinking he fiddles with the ring on his finger.
ALISON: Must have been pretty cool having your mom in the movies.

ALISON: That's.I don't know what to say. ( Beat ) I haven't got a Oh. ( Beat ) Well, you can always come here to listen to it. Sidney takes the record and puts it on the turntable in the corner of the room. He selects the finale music - it's funny and sad, glamorous and romantic. They listen to it for a moment. Sidney starts to dance a little. He cha-cha's over to her and holds out his hand.

ALISON: Are you kidding? I could throw up on you again.
SIDNEY: Alison reluctantly gets up. They dance ironically. Alison laughs a little. Gradually they get more into it, enjoying the music - a man in shorts and a woman in pyjamas, cha-cha-chaing, a summer breeze wafting in the through the open windows behind 102 INT. I SPY AREA - DAY 102 Some weeks later. Alison sits at her desk, trying to work. She looks up and catches Maddox watching her with soulful eyes from across the room. She looks quickly away, unsettled. Sidney sits at his desk surreptitiously watching her,
INGRID: Hey, Alice? Versace. You like?
ALISON: I'm good, thanks.

ANNA: These are gorgeous, but I'm just too fat.
INGRID: Oh don't be crazy! Alice? Is Anna Not at all. Why, she's so thin I could just take her little spindly body and snap it over my knee like a dry fucking twig.
ALISON: ( BRIGHT )
ANNA: ( AUTOMATICALLY )
ALISON: Oh, and for your information Sidney Young has got more going for him than most of the men in this town. She gets up to leave, the others gawping after her.
SIDNEY: Hey Alison, I was wondering if you wanted to.( Beat. Starting again ) Hello there. Listen I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie or.a meal.or.( Beat, starting again. ) Alison.

ALISON: ( INTERRUPTING )
SIDNEY: Sorry. I was just saying. Maddox appears and gives Alison a glass of champagne. He kisses her.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Back in a minute. He walks off again. Sidney stares dumbly after him.
ALISON: ( EMBARRASSED )
SIDNEY: ( DYING )
ALISON: Yeah, so.maybe he does care after all, right?
SIDNEY: They stand in an awkward silence, watching the party.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Hello Sidney. Someone said you'd come as a Count but I thought I'd Sidney doesn't answer, turns to leave.
SIDNEY: ( TIGHT ) LAWRENCE MADDOX
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Yeah. Should have done it long ago but, you know me - just not very good at expressing my emotions. Right?
SIDNEY: Wait! Eleanor wait! The window glides down.
ELEANOR JOHNSON: Let me do the profile on Vincent.
SIDNEY: Let me do the profile on Vincent.
ELEANOR JOHNSON: ( AMUSED )
SIDNEY: You get full copy approval. It'll be like you've written it! The window stops. Eleanor stares at him, considering. Sidney looks past her to Vincent.
VINCENT: ( Beat, enjoying this ) You don't look like you're Beat. Sidney kneels down on the side-walk beside the limousine. The rain pours down on him. The limousine drives away. Sidney stares dumbly up at something across the On the building across the street is an ENORMOUS ANIMATED BILLBOARD L'OREAL ADVERTISEMENT - SOPHIE MAES, in a gold ball-gown and make-up, hair coiffured in classic forties Hollywood style. As we watch she BLOWS US A KISS. Underneath is the slogan - I'm Here.

LAWRENCE MADDOX: The new talent?
ALISON: The new talent?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Do you think you could drop the little wife routine? It's kind of in bad taste. Alison stares at him sadly
ALISON: I guess you're right.( Quietly ) What goes around comes around. Maddox is about to say something but changes his mind.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: I'll see you back home. He is about to leave when he notices Alison's notebook on the table.
ELEANOR JOHNSON: Sophie's going to get a Golden Globe nomination for best Wow. That's fantastic.( Beat ) But.the nominations haven't been announced yet?
SIDNEY: Wow. That's fantastic.( Beat ) But.the nominations haven't been announced yet?

SIDNEY: SOPHIE MAES
SOPHIE MAES: You let me down!
SIDNEY: Too high! You couldn't do it. Too Sophie calmly unzips her dress and steps out of it, standing in her underwear. There is applause from the on- lookers. Calmly she steps out of the window onto the ledge and disappears from sight. The on-lookers crane out of the window, yelling After a moment Sophie appears at another window further along the wall and climbs back into the room to ecstatic applause. She stares imperiously at Sidney.
SOPHIE MAES: What are you?
SIDNEY: Your limpy pig.
SOPHIE MAES: I'm your limpy pig!
SIDNEY: I'm your limpy pig!
SOPHIE MAES: That's right! Okay, limpy pig. You need to pay a forfeit. Whatcha got?
SIDNEY: I've got my little limpy dance. Sidney dances a little, jiggling up and down.
SOPHIE MAES: ( SUDDENLY )
SIDNEY: I.I can't.
SOPHIE MAES: Give me the ring. I want it.
SIDNEY: I can't. Sophie stares at him through narrowed eyes.
SOPHIE MAES: Okay, give me the ring and if I win tomorrow, I'll let you have sex with me. The on-lookers shriek with delight. Sidney stares at her. He looks past her to his reflection in the window - a drunk man in his underwear, swaying from side to side.
SIDNEY: ( muttering to himself ) You're a star. You're a big, bright shining star. He snorts a line and, leaning back, flicks blankly through TV channels - a sports programme, a news station, a sit-com He snorts another line, flicks stations - more sports, a music video, a black and white movie. Sidney stops, staring at the screen. TV SCREEN - we're watching the fifties British movie we saw at the beginning of the film. Sidney's MOTHER is typing at the desk in the background. She gets up from the desk and walks into another office. Sidney stares, frozen. Sidney's mother passes the LEAD ACTRESS who is staring out of the window, smoking. She stares at her sympathetically.
SIDNEY'S MOTHER: ( Celia Johnson accent ) Don't worry Mary.you'll meet him one day.
LEAD ACTRESS: ( SMILING SADLY )
SIDNEY'S MOTHER: Oh, when you meet the One, you'll She walks on. Sidney stares at the screen.
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Well, well. Look at you.
SIDNEY: Is Alison here?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Alison? No, we went our separate ways. Actually she left me. Tells me she's in love with someone Sidney stares at him.
ELEANOR JOHNSON: ( smiling, hissing ) What are you doing? Let her go!
SIDNEY: She isn't the One. My mother gave me that ring and told me I had to give it to the One. She isn't the The applause is still going strong. TV Cameras move in on Sophie as she starts to struggle, her smile slipping. Sidney tries to pull the ring free from her finger. Officials move in.
ELEANOR JOHNSON: What the fuck are you doing?
SIDNEY: ( YANKING )
KILLED CUBA!: Sophie stares at him for a moment then with a shriek launches herself at him. They tumble backwards. The Officials rush upon them. There are gasps from the other tables, people standing up to see what's going on.
MRS KOWLASKI: ( GRIMLY )
ON TV: Sophie kicks out at Sidney, ripping her dress in the Oh God no.not the Versace. Security pile on Sidney.
INGRID: Oh God no.not the Versace. Security pile on Sidney.
TICKET CLERK: The next available flight is ten am sir. Gets you into New York six thirty PM. Sidney sighs.
SIDNEY: Stop the car!
SIDNEY: How's the novel?
ALISON: Sidney smiles. He takes the notebook from her and tosses it back onto the picnic blanket. Then he kisses her. As he does so he takes the RING and slips it into Alison's coat Then they begin to dance, cha-cha-chaaing happily at the back of the park, as the music swells, lit by the flickering light from the screen. Suddenly Sidney freezes, staring over Alison's shoulder to where we can see he has accidentally thrown her NOTEBOOK onto a lit candle. It is now ON FIRE. Sidney shoves Alison aside and dives for the book.
