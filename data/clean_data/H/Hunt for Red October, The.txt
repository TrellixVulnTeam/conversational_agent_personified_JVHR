FADE IN: A BARREN LANDSCAPE beneath slate-grey sky. Frigid rock and stunted trees fall to an ice-choked coast. Congealed sea on a desolate beach.
RAMIUS: It is cold.
BORODIN: ( INTO MIKE )
RAMIUS: ( GLANCING AT BORODIN )
BORODIN ): ( under his breath ) Think of it, Comrade.. .son of only a humble mM worker.
BORODIN: ( under his breath ) Think of it, Comrade.. .son of only a humble mM worker.
RAMIUS: Quiet as grass, Vastly. Quiet as grass. ( louder, turning ) Good morning, Comrade political off=er
PUTIN: Ah,, Captain, every time I climb that ladder, I realize what an over-fed ox rve become. Put in smiles. Ramius smiles back, but his eyes are cold. Suddenly, there's not a lot of Lave on the bridge:
RAMIUS: You know he was.
PU TIN: I knew a Lithuanian once. His words hang like rotten fru
BORODIN: it's time, Captain. St M dealing with Putin's exit, Ramius turns away from the hatch, contemplating the shore. After a beat, softly:.
RAMIUS: We go.
BORO DIN: ( into the headset ) Clear the bridge! Prepare to dive. Captain coming below. Of cer of the deck, make signal to escort:. Ramius and. Borodin disappear. Red October prepares to dive. All that remains is icy .sea and the Sand. Then, faintly at first, from the frozen coast:
KRASNY OKTOBR: THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER CHORUS BOOMS. Male VOICES ring in thundering tribute to the heart and soul of mother Russia. Credits keep rolling. Then, from
THE DARKNESS: A LITHOGRAPH
A LITHOGRAPH: of John Paul Jones fighting the Serapis appears. It's on the wall. in a cluttered study. Books crowd every bit of space. Photos, models and nautical memorabilia, everywhere.
JACK RYAN: early-thirties, good-Looking, disheveled and harried, stuffs papers into a brief case. Slamming it shut, he reaches for his raincoat.
BEHIND HIM: A LITTLE GIRL appears in the doorway. Her name is Sally. She's Ryan's daughter. Wearing a nightgown with butterflies on it, she's carrying a well-worn Koala bear:
SALLY: ( TURNING )
RYAN: ( TURNING )
SALLY: I can't. Kneeing beside: her, Ryan talks in a steady unpatronizing way. He loves her to death:
RYAN: What's the matter?
SALLY: Where are you going?
RYAN: I have to go on a business trip and you have to go to sleep or when you grow up you'll only be two inches tall.
SALLY: Stanley keeps waking me up. Stanley is Sally's bear. Ryan talks to it like it was alive. it makes Sally grin.
RYAN: What's the matter, Stanley? Are you nuts or something?
SALLY: He's not, nuts. He's lonely.
MARGARET RYAN: English, intelligent features, in tweed suit and raincoat. A matronly woman hovers in the doorway behind her:
MARGARET: We are never going to make it.
RYAN: Just a minute. -
SALLY: CUT TO: THE ROVER
RYAN: CUT TO: THE ROVER
THE ROVER: pulling to a curb in driving rain at Heathrow. Red Army CHORUS SWELLS. Leaping out, Ryan grabs luggage and races to the driver's side. Margaret pulls his face through the window.
RYAN: I'm all wet.
MARGARET: ( KISSING HIM )
RYAN: ( GRINNING )
MARGARET: Get out of here, Yank. Or Ml tear you limb from limb.
RYAN: Won't do me any good -
MARGARET: ( SHEEPISH )

RYAN: ( GIG )
STEWARDESS: Can I get you anything, sir?

STEWARDESS: ( SWALLOWING )
RYAN: ( SWALLOWING )
STEWARDESS: Are you a scientist?
RYAN: No. I just read a lot of books.
STEWARDESS: Well, try and get some sleep anyway. She leaves. Wide awake, Ryan stares out the window at the spinning dark. Red Army CHORUS BOOMS.
RYAN: humping his suitcase into a giant terminal at the end of a long line of travelers. Above the line, a sign:
U.S. CUSTOMS: DU:LLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WASHINGTON, D.C. A GUY IN SUNGLASSES moves down, the line, stopping beside Ryan:

GREER: Jack, boy. Get yourself in here.
RYAN: ( EGG )
GREER: Come on over here and sit down. You want coffee?
RYAN: I think I need ooffiae. Ryan perches on the couch. Greer pours Ryan takes it in both hands, coaling it with his breath.
GREER: I'm not gonna ask you how your 11 flight was. When's the last time you slept?
RYAN: ( EYEING WATCH )
GREER: How's Margaret?
RYAN: Fine. She sends you her best.
GREER: And Sally? What is she now, three?
RYAN: A very precocious five. A week ago she announced her life would be a loot less lonely if Margaret and I would buy her a baby brother.
GREER: ( SMILING )
RYAN: British Intelligence received these two days ago. She's the Red October. The Soviet's newest typhoon.
GREER: Jesus. The Brits actually got a man into the construction shed?
RYAN: ( DROPPING MORE PHOTOS )
PHOTOS ): This pair was digitally enhanced for line resolution. This one for color.
RYAN: Twelve meters longer than the normal typhoon, three meters wider. The captain's name is Ramixts.
GREER: One of yours?
RYAN: Yes, sir. I did the bio on him last year. He's taken out the lead boat in each new sub class for ten years. Fairly good political connections. He's also trained most of their attack boat skippers. They can him the Vilnius schoolmaster. Greer studies one of the photos with a magnifying glass. Something captures his attention:
GREER: What are these doors?
RYAN: The doors, Admiral, are the problem. I don't know what they are and neither do the English.
GREER: Sub driver. Did he get hurt or something?
RYAN: ( NODDING )
GREER: When .do you want to talk to him?
GREER: When .do you want to talk to him?
RYAN: Right now if it's OX with you? 've. never met him personally, but -
GREER: I'll take care of it.
RYAN: ( SHOCKED )
GREER: Relax, son. The Navy's got a Las Angeles c'la'ss sittJng right off their doorstep. In a few days we'll know everything about her but the wok's name.
RYAN: Well, In that case
GREER: For Sally?
JONES: HEAR I
HEAR I: No. Maybe. It's buried in.
BEAUMONT: No. Maybe. It's buried in.
JONES: ( LEADING )
BEAUMONT: Surface clutter? I should go to SAPS?
JONES: Correct, Seaman Beaumont. Surface Affects Processing. There is hope for your small brain yet.
BEAUMONT: A whale, Beaumont. A whale. A marine mammal that knows a fuck of a lot more about sonar than you do. Beaumont frowns. Appearing in the sonar shack door, directly
JONES: A whale, Beaumont. A whale. A marine mammal that knows a fuck of a lot more about sonar than you do. Beaumont frowns. Appearing in the sonar shack door, directly
BEHIND JONES: THE COB
THE COB: Chief of the Boat, a barrel-chested bear, smiles at Beaumont:
COB: He gets to raggin you too bad, kid, you can always ask him about Pavarattt.. Jones sinks into his chair. Beaumont grins. Sea story coming. From the look on Jones' face, it promises to be a good one:
BEAUMONT: Tell me, Chief.
COB: ( taking his time ) Well, Jonesy here, he's a music freak, right? And he figures this sonar system is basically just a big old 300 million ddllar stereo unit. So he gets this piece of Pavarmt3i
JONES: it was Paganini.
COB: Whatever. It's this piece of music he likes so much he wants to share it, right? So he re-wires the computer and figures how to put it in the water with a gigawatt of juice behind it.
BEAUMONT: What should I
JONES: Be sti 1, I got it. Jones works in silence, then punches the intervom:
JONES: Conn, sonar.
VOICE: ( ON INTERCOM )
JONES: Distant contact, submerged bearing zero- nine-seven. It's a wild guess, but I'd say we had a Boomer headed out of the barn.
MANCUSO: Start a plot, Jonesy. IM be there in a second. Leaving the deck, Mancuso glances at his executive offker
IN SONAR: Jones is already working on the plot. In font of him on the sonar display, the flashing light is starting to move. Mancuso sticks his head in.
MANCUSO: What do you have?
RAMIUS: in Red October's Conn. Much larger than the control center on the Dallas. Leaving the deck, Ramius heads aft, glancing at Borodin:
RAMIUS: When you see Putin, tell him that when it's convenient, 191 be in my stateroom. Leaving the Conn, Ramius enters
A HALLWAY: Moving past a radio compartment on his left, Ramius stops at a door,
ENTERING THE: CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM
CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM: C3osing the door behind him, Ramius turns into the room. Surprised, he sees
PU TIN: seated at a desk, reading a bible. Startled, Putin looks up:
RAMIUS: What are you doing?
PT TIN: It's my responsibility to oversee the stability of the crew, Captain. You know that.
RAMIUS: And you accomplish this by searching through my papers and invading my There is no such thing as privacy in the Soviet Union, Comrade. It's antithetical to the oal]ective good.

RAMIUS: The book belonged to my wife. I keep it only for sentimental value.
PUTIN: Your wife was a beautiful woman. A tragedy her life was cut so short.
RAMIUS: ( TURNING )
PUTIN: ( trying to joke ) Given the amount of fire power on Red October, I'm sure the whole world will. breathe a cm1 eotive sigh of relief.
RAMIUS: ( LKE ICE )
PUTIN: ( STANDING )
RAMIUS: I suggest we open our orders.
PUTIN: As you wish. There's a safe on the wall. Ramius spins the combination. Inside, another safe with four locks. Both Ramius and Putin have keys. Inside the second safe, a large envelope. it has an ornate. scarlet seal, marked 'Top Secret'. Ramius cracks the seeal, removing four pages of operation orders. Glancing at Putin; he reads:
RAMIUS: We are to proceed to grid 54-90 and rendezvous with the Akula submarine, Captain Tupalev's boat.
PUTIN: Captain Tupalev's boat.
RAMIUS: You know Tupolav?
PU TIN: I know that he is descended from a long line of aril rats and that he was a student of yours. it is rumored, he has no love in his heart for you. Why is that? Ramius pours two cups of steaming tea from a silver pot on a serving tray, offering it to Putin.. Putin takes the cup.
RAMIUS: There is no room in Tupolev's heart for anyone or anything except Tupolev.
PUTIN: Captain, this is an historic moment for all. of us. I should like to make a request.
RAMIUS: Before you do, I want to talk to you about something important.
PUTIN: ( NOT HEARING )
RAMIUS: ( RESIGNED )
SKIP TYLER: built-like a fireplug, a monument to logic and impatience, leans on a cane, atop a platform by the tank#I watching
TYLER: You're never gonna go anywhere, Be.. Unless you close the hatch and start the goddam engine!
STEINER: Brilliant, Skip. You're one of those guys you can't hide things from, right? Tyler. grits his teeth. Steiner closes the hatch. Across the room, Ryan enters. Spotting Tyler, he moves to the platform, staring at the mini sub. The propeller starts turning. It submerges.
TYLER: ( TURNING )
RYAN: Yes sir. ( re: mini sub ) What it that thing?
TYLER: Deep submergence rescue vehicle.
RYAN: That's what a DSRV looks like.
TYLER: That's it. I designed this one. lt's aan d the Mystic.
RYAN: What are you doing with it? Tyler climbs off the piatfarm, working his cane with practiced precision. Taking Ryan by the arm, he heads for a door:
TYLER: Rigging it with a generic docking acllar so it will mate with British, German, other kinds of subs.
TYLER'S OFFICE: high tech naval architecture. Technicians, graduate students move about in the background. Tyler is hunched over the Red October
TYLER: Bigger than a regular typhoon.
RYAN: ( GRINNING )
TYLER: Could. Question is why would you? Besides, they're symmetrical right straight through the hull.
RYAN: How about a towed sonar array?
TYLER: Barely clears the screw in the Tyler freezes. Somewhere in that vast abundance of grey matter, a
RYAN: A what?
TYLER: Caterpillar drive. Magnetohydrodynamic propulsion. Like a linear induction motor with saltwater as the ;tat-r. You follow?
RYAN: ( SMILING )
TYLER: Items like a jet engine for water. Goes in the front, gets squirted out the back. Only, It's got no moving parts, see. So it's' potentially very quiet.
RYAN: Try silent If this works, we'll have to find a whole new way to track submarines. Ryan grapples with the implications. Tyler trips down memory lane:
TYLER: Try silent If this works, we'll have to find a whole new way to track submarines. Ryan grapples with the implications. Tyler trips down memory lane:
RYAN: it put to sea this morning.
TYLER: ( SHAKING HIS HEAD )
HEAD ): You know when I was eleven years old, I helped my daddy build a bomb shelter in the basement because some fool parked a dozen warheads in Cuba, ninety miles from the Florida coast.
RYAN: Any records of our work on the caterpillar?
TYLER: ( GRABBING HIS CANE )
CANE ): We got an archive. Let's get dusty.
LOGINOV: tweet 6ts, muscular, in striped sail or shirt and bell-bottom pang, tosses a hunk of f into a pail.. To Loginov.'s right, Rami:a and Borodin talk with
RAMIUS: If I hadn't spilled the tea, Putin might never have slipped and -
PETROV: You must not blame yourself,,- Captain. Accidents happen. I assume we wall be returning to base?
RAMIUS: We will not.
PETROV: But how can we continue a m scion without a political offcer?
RAMIUS: For many years the Russian Navy went to sea before there were political offScers, Yes, but -
PETROV: Yes, but -
RAMIUS: ( RE: ORDERS ) RAMIUS ( CONT'D )
LOGINOV: ( TREMBLING )
RAMIUS: Good. Now, I want you and the Doctor to witness this, Ioginov. I have removed Putin's missfle key from his neck and am keeping it myse f. Iognov blinks. Petrov frowns. Closing the freezer door, the sates ]save. Loginov isn't sure what to do. Petrov's agitated:
PETROV: This is all very unnerving, Captain. The reason for having two missM keys in the first place is to prevent one person from.
RAMIUS: From what, Doctor?
PETROV: Making a mistake and.
RAMIUS: Impossible. We are ordered to maintain strict radio silence.
PETROV: Captain, perhaps I should keep Putin's key until
RAMIUS: ( SHARPLY )
MANCUSO: bent over Jones' shoulder in the Da11as' sonar shack, concentrating on the blinking light on the sonar display. Thompson's to his left. Jones is on a headset:
JONES: ( LISTENING )
MANCUSO: Can you identify him?
JONES: Computer's chewing on it. Twin screw and the plant noise sounds like a typhoon but - Computer ptintar CLATTERS. Ripping off the printout, Mancuso
UNKNOWN IDENTITY: NOT PREVIOUSLY RECORDED Must be a new boat.
MANCUSO: Must be a new boat.
THOMPSON: Fleet hasn't said a word about it.
MANCUSO: Alright. Start a f]e on his, Jonesy. For now, call his Sierra thirty-five. ( .Leaving ) r91 see if we can work in a little closer and sniff his out. Thompson fcDows Mancuso. Beaumont glances at Jones, whispering:
BEAUMONT: Won't the Soviets hear us?
JONES: Not if we stay in his baffles, seaman Beaumont. Not if we stay in his baffles. Come in behind his propeller and he's deaf as a post.
TO BORODIN: CAPTAIN LIEUTENANT BORIS KAMAROV Red October's navigator, watches Ramius i tently. The tension is palpable. Something extraordinary is about to happen:
RAMIUS: Down scope.
KAMAROV: Sonar is clear, Captain.
RAMIUS: All right. rm going to address the crew. Ramius grabs the whip telephone. Jaw set, his eyes blaze with

KAMAROV: ( 'TURNING )
KAMAROV: Outer doors are open, Captain.
RAMIUS: Engage the caterpi lar.
JONES: in the Dalla' sonar shack, working his computer. The COB is behind him, Beaumont to his left. Red October's AMPISFIED HISS f Ms the room. Suddenly,
COB: What happened?
JONES: Don't know.
COB: What do you mean, don't know?
RAMIUS: on the deck by the phone in Red October's Conn. Conscious of all eyes on him, he turns to a HELMSMAN:
RAMIUS: Left full rudder.
HELMSMAN: Rudder is left fuB..
RAMIUS: Navigator, make your new course Coming to course two-five-zero. Kama=ov draws a line on his chart. The new course is west into the Atlantic. Suddenly, the intercom CRACKLES:

RAMIUS: Sonar. Is the American turning to Ballow us?
RAMIUS: ( SLOW SMILE )

MANCUSO: it did what?
JONES: It disappeared, sir.
MANCUSO: t a d ) What are you talking about? Check your gear.
JONES: Running diagnostics, now, Captain. Jones is starting to sweat. He runs his tests. Nothing. urning, he stares blankly at Mancuso:

TUPOLEV: To what purpose?
BONAVIA: To inform them Red October has not What makes you think she hasn't? Tupolev glides to a quartermaster's station. Following him, Bonavia's stomach growls.
TUPOLEV: What makes you think she hasn't? Tupolev glides to a quartermaster's station. Following him, Bonavia's stomach growls.
TUPOLEV: Has it occurred to you that Red October may already be in position? That Ramius is merely hiding behind his silent drive? Waiting for me to break radio silence and make a fool of myself?
BONAVIA: ( FRUSTRATED ) BUT -
TUPOLEV: I will not break radio silence. We wilt lie here quietly for a few more hours. If Ramius hasn't arrived by then, I'll contact Red Fleet Command.
BONAVIA: Captain, I am concerned that -
TUPOLEV: I Care little for your concerns, Comrade. Tupolev leaves. Bonavia glances at the quartermaster. His stomach growls again.

MANCUSO: I'm gonna radio Fleet Command. He takes off. Jones hears something buried in the PROPELLERS and CAVITATION NOISE. A strange WHOOSHING SOUND. Frowning, he starts a tape rewarder.

JEFFREY PELT: the President's National Security Advisor arrives. In his mid-mss, wearing wire-rim spectacles, Pelt's nearsighted, brOliant and a crackerjack poker player. Generals and Admirals take their places. Pelt site at the head of the tabl, turning to Greer:
PELT: Let's get started.
GREER: Yes, sir. The preliminary briefing today w M be handled by Dr. Jack Ryan. I believe you've seen some of his :work.
PELT: ( TO RYAN )
RYAN: Gentlemen, the last twenty four hours have seen some extraordinary Soviet naval activity. The first to sail was
PELT: You would characterize this as a first strike weapon, Dr. Ryan? Ryan glances at Greer. Greer smi reassuringly.
RYAN: There's no doubt about that, sir. She is designed to approach by stealth, and fire on a target with little or no warning.
ADMIRAL: An offensive weapon. The kind you start wars with.
RYAN: Precisely, Admiral..
SOME: ( CHECKING NOTES )
PELT: Absence of activity in the Pacific suggest this is probably just an exercise having nothing to do with the Red October. A General starts to object. He's cut off by JUDGE MOORE, a white-haired civilian near the top of the table:

PELT: Sink her?
ADMIRAL: My god. They've got a madman on their hands. He's gonna start a war. A spirited discussion ensues. Tuning it out, Ryan stares at the picture of Ramius and his wife. Urgently, he whispers to Greer:
RYAN: This is the twenty-gird, isn't it? Greer nods. Order in the room has broken down. Generals and Admirals argue vehemently about appropriate. responses. Staring at the photos, a light goes off in Ryan's brain: SljenCel. Ryan realizes everyone in the room is staring at him.
PELT: ( DRYLY )
RYAN: Uhhmm.I was just thinking there was perhaps another possibility we ought to consider. Ryan takes a deep breath.
GENERAL: Do you mean to suggest -
PELT: Go ahead, Dr. Ryan.
RYAN: Well, Ramius trained most of their Officer Corps. He'd be in a position to sect men willing to help him. And he's not He's Lithuanian by birth, and by heritage. He was raised by his maternal grandfather, who was a fisherman. He has no children, no ties to leave behind and -

PELT: Bottom line, how long before Rami be in a position to launch his misses at us?
ADMIRAL: Four days.
PELT: Alright. I'll brief the President. That will, be all, gentlemen.
GREER: I said speak your mind, Jack, but
JESUS: shaking his head, Greer pats Ryan's shoulder and leaves. Ryan's mouth is dry. Pelt gets up:
PELT: You slammed the door on the General pretty hard, Jack.
RYAN: It wasn't my intention, sir -

RYAN: Well, somebody has to go out and try- - to contact him.
PELT: OK. When can you leave?
RYAN: ( FLUSHED )
PELT: Perfect. I can't ask any of these chaï¿½tacters to go. None of them would volunteer putting their reputations on the line. And anyway, none of them are expendable.

RAMIUS: There is no way we could have accomplished our task with Putin aboard. He would have stopped us.
T BILISI: I have no objections to eliminating him. He was a pig. But it's a decision we should all have made.
BORODIN: You're not in command.
T BILISI: Don't give me that command garbage, Vasily. This is no ordinary cruise. We're all risking our lives. Everything that happens affects-each of us.

JONES: ( TO MANCUSO )
MANCUSO: Go ahead.
JONES: I've been working on a sound I heard when the typhoon disappeared. I washed it through the tape machine several times and managed to isolate it. But when I asked the computer to identify it, the answer I got. was magma displacement.
MANCUSO: Magma displacement?
JONES: Yes sir. See, the system we are using was originally- designed to look four seismic events and although we adapted it. to hunt for submarines -
MANCUSO: utto the chase, Jonesy._:.,
JONES: Aye, aye, sir. Anyway,; I got curious, and. started tracking. the sound on our lateral array. I located it four different times. The fifth time it was gone and I couldn't find it. But I want to show you what I worked up. Picking up a grease pencil, Jones makes calculations on the status board overlaying the nautical map:
MANCUSO: Well, I figure it couldn't be very far away from us, right? Let's say it was halfway between us and Iceland. That would put it on a course like this. Jones makes more calculations on the. status board. Mancuso recognizes a pattern:
JONES: Well, I figure it couldn't be very far away from us, right? Let's say it was halfway between us and Iceland. That would put it on a course like this. Jones makes more calculations on the. status board. Mancuso recognizes a pattern:
MANCUSO: Headed directly into Red Route One.
JONES: Exactly. Sir, I believe the sound I heard is the acoustical signature of some kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and he's taking the inshore track off the Iceland coast.
THOMPSON: What do you think, captain? Mancuso stares-at the status board, then turns to Jones:
MANCUSO: Let me see if I got this straight. The three minion dollar computer tells you you're chasing after an earthquake and you aren't convinced. So you get curious and came up with this theory: on your own?
JONES: ( UNCERTAIN )
MANCUSO: Relax, Jonesy. You sold me. Jones grans.
JONES: Yes, sir. Now that I know what to listen for, I'1 bag the sucker cold.
DAVENPORT: frowning at Ryan, who sits opposite him, finishing a sandwich:
DAVENPORT: Christ'_ I've heard some strange stuff, Ryan, but that takes it. Ramius must have a hundred men on that boat. They can't all want to defect. He'd have a mutiny on his hands.
RYAN: Not ne s_~:4'y. If he personally recruita d the of6cers, it's theoret i ally
DAVENPORT: Theoretically, anything's p â¢ But you're not in some cubicle at CIA. Over by the porthole, Painter clears his throat:
PAINTER: For the sake of argument, let's assume you're right and Ramius intends to defect. What are you gonna do with the boat? You cant keep it. The Russians will. want it back. And theyRl know you've got it, :`because the crew wl]l tell them so. Or do you intend to keep them too?
RYAN: Perhaps it would be enough to get some I men aboard to analyze the propulsion
PAINTER: ( SMILING )
F: A Coast Guard Inspection?
RYAN: Perhaps. I'm not sure that -
L: Well, I agree with chuck on one thing, son. You've got your neck stretched way out there. Didn't Greer ever teach you the rules of survival in a bureaucracy? ( Ryan smiles weakly ) Still, it would be nice to keep it. When's the last time you slept?
I: Well, I agree with chuck on one thing, son. You've got your neck stretched way out there. Didn't Greer ever teach you the rules of survival in a bureaucracy? ( Ryan smiles weakly ) Still, it would be nice to keep it. When's the last time you slept?
PAINTER: Well, I agree with chuck on one thing, son. You've got your neck stretched way out there. Didn't Greer ever teach you the rules of survival in a bureaucracy? ( Ryan smiles weakly ) Still, it would be nice to keep it. When's the last time you slept?
RYAN: Can't remember. Every time I get. the chance, somebody puts me on another OK. Why don't you rack out fear a while. The chief outside will find you quarters.
PAINTER: OK. Why don't you rack out fear a while. The chief outside will find you quarters.
PAINTER: When you shook hands with him, you notice the ring on his finger,, Chuck?
PAINTER: Greer told me about him. Three weeks after he was commissioned, he was in a chopper on a rescue mission in the Med. They went down. Bad. P11 and crew killed instantly. That kid spent eight months in traction with a broken. back, and two years learning to walk again. I think lt:'s O K for him to wear.: the uniform. - ( beat ), Don't you?
I: closing the door to a stateroom. Exhausted, he tumbles face down on a lower bunk, head on a pillow. A sliver of light from the door to a head hits his face:
RYAN: ( MUMBLING )
MELEKHIN: surrounded by HOWLING NOISE in Red October's engineerin compartment. The. bulkheads shake. A TECHNICIAN SHOUTS
TECHNICIAN: Converter temperature'is egress above specks and rising!
MELEKHIN: ( SHOUTING BACK )
TECHNICIAN: ( SHOUTING )
RAMIUS: What is It?
MELEKHIN: ( SHOUTING BACK )
RAMIUS: ( TO TECHNICIAN
TECHNICIAN: Caterpi']]ar flows are stabilizing.
PETROV: ( SCARED )
MELEKHIN: There was a power spike, but the reactor scrammed itself automatically.
PETROV: But are there any radiation
MELEKHIN: ( ANGRY )
RAMIUS: How long before you can fix it?
MELEKHIN: I have to find out what's wrong first. It could be a problem with the liquid helium cycle. Maybe the super conducting material has failed.
RAMIUS: We're going to have to run an normal propuLainn. Can you get the reactor up?
MELEKHIN: PETROV -
Y]: PETROV -
RAMIUS: That will be all, Doctor. Frightened, Petrov, stares at Ramb, The Captain's indomitable. Petrov leaves. Borodin has concerns of his own:
BORODIN': What if we're detected, Captain?
RAMIUS: Pray that we aren't, Vasily.
ANDREI LYSENKO: fifties, dewlapped Soviet Ambassador to the United States, in a dark suit and tie. Lysenko's uncomfortable. Pelt stares at him:
PELT: Forgive me, Ambassador, for dispensing with the usual formalities. But the President views this situation as critical. Our m,7 ttary counts thirty-two of your anti-submarine aircraft in the sky laying down enough sonar buoys that a man could walk from Greenland to Norway without getting his feet wet. What's going on?
LYSENKO: we fear she may. be down. Lysenko leans forward:
PELT: So do I, Ambassador Lysenko. Confusion could be
AMALRIC: Sonar contact on buoy number one- seven-nine. Contact is twenty-seven mil southwest, ze o-nine-zero. Data indicates contact is Red October.

COPILOT: Weapons are armed. All pre-launch check is satsfactcry.
AMALRIC: ( INTO HEADSET )
RAMIUS: in Red October's Conn, talking in hushed tones with Melekhin and Borodin. Oblivious to their conversation, the crew moves about in the background.
RAMIUS: What do you mean, â you stall, don't know?
MELEKHIN: Captain, I need -
BORODIN: Dammit, Alex. If we run any longer on normal power, weft have the w-hole -

STADNYUK: Leaving his quartermaster's station, Stadnyuk stands on shaky legs between Ramius and Kamarov:
RAMIUS: You're relieved of your duties, Ivan! Return to your quarters.
AMALRIC: ( ON HEADSET )
KAMAROV: Four hundred meters. Bulkheads CRACK under tons of pressure. Torpedo and counter- measure'. PING on AUDIO. Red October dives under the torpedo. it misses the safl by inches. Lacking a target, it automatically initiates a wide turn to the left.
AMALRIC: ( INTO HEADSET )
KAMAROV: ( READING )
HELMSMAN: We're flooding! Expressinnless, Kamarov slams him back to his chair and shuts down the relief valve. The spray stops:
KAMAROV: Keep your teeth on the shelf, boy. Nobody's flooding.
WATER: the Red October hits bottom, kicking up sand and sit, bulkheads fragile as eggshells.
AMALRIC: ( INTO HEADSET )
HELMSMAN: Captain, who's shooting at us?
KAMAROV: Easy, boy. Borodin COUGHS. Confused, the crew watch their Captain. Lights stay on. Concussions die down. Ships speakers CRACKLE:
RAMIUS: This Is the Captain. The explosion you Just heard was the first operational test of a new counter-measure. The torpedo was launched by our friends in Soviet aviation. Borodin stares at Ramius:
KAMAROV: ( TO PLANESMAN )
MELEKHIN: Someone rigged the pipe so that when we took a down angle it would fall into the gears.
RAMIUS: No doubt about it. And whoever it was knew exactly how to cripple the caterpillar in a way not easy to find.
MELEKHIN: No doubt about it. And whoever it was knew exactly how to cripple the caterpillar in a way not easy to find.
RAMIUS: ( to Bo=odin ) We21. have to find a way to get the crew off this ship, now. We are in danger every second they are aboard.
BORODIN: But, Captain. There's over a hundred of them.
RYAN: brushing his teeth in the head adjacent to his stateroom on the Kennedy. Through an open door, his unmade bunk. Catching sight of himself in the mirror:
RYAN: We'd have to get rid of the crew.
JONES: in the Dalla' sonar shack, working furiously with his equipment. Beaumont watches. The COB's behind him. TRANSIENT ocean NOISE on SPEAKERS. Over the INTERCOM:
JONES: ( INTO INTERCOM )
COB: Where is your phantom Russian sub, Jonesy? According to your calcuiatÂ£ons we ' should have picked him up hours ago.
JONES: He's close. I can feel it.
COB: Close don't count in anything but horseshoes and hand grenades. Beaumont CHORTLES. Jones glances at him:
JONES: Don't encourage the man, seaman Beaumont. He's very old.
JONES: You're an old man, COB. Way over the ham. Your trout is so wrinkled it's about to faU off.
COB: Screw you.
JONES: Speaking of which, what happened to that Hustler Magazine that was in the head?
COB: ( BLANCHING )
BEAUMONT: ( M AY )
JONES: For many months, seaman Beaumont, there was a Hustler magazine located in the crew's head. it was community Then one day, it disappeared. The ..COB. here was the last person seen entering the head before it vanished.
BEAUMONT: Where'd it' go?
COB: ( SQUIRMING )
JONES: I have a theory, seaman Beaumont. I believe the CO B Is like a black widow, spider. After he has sex with a magazine, he eats it. Beaumont HOWLS. The COB turns pink.
COS: Goddam you, Jonesy
JONES: ( RAISING HIS HAND )
HAND ): Jones the tunes a dial. In the distance, barely di i nguishahle through transient NOISE, the sound of RUSTLING WATER followed by a fleeting HUM.
PAINTER: Leaning over a status board in the Combat Information Center on the Kennedy. Replete with lights, the status board reveals details of force deployment. Ryan enters, carrying copse:
RYAN: Morning, Admiral.
PAINTER: Sleep well?
RYAN: Like the dead. ( re: status board ) Our friends have been busy.
PAINTER: During the night, they positioned most of their front line submarines at barrier stations between Greenland and Iceland. Here, here and here.
RYAN: Could you get me aboard the Dallas?
PAINTER: We could fly you out there in a helicopter. But I don't think you'd like that much.
PAINTER: That's all there is, I'm afraid. Putting down his coffee cup, Ryan stares at the status board. A sal]ci r arrives with a message. Reading it, Painter glances at Ryan:
RYAN: ( FLY )
MANCUSO: at tire control in the Dallas' Conn. Thompson's on the deck.
THOMPSON: ( TO MANCUSO )
MANCUSO: Jones -'studies his w tern - The COB stands behind him. Beaumont watches. A]l kidding has stopped. This is strictly business:
JONES: ( ON MIKE )
THOMPSON: Sonar, Conn, aye.
FIRE CONTROL: Concur, possible zig. Bearing rate increasing to the right.
IN SONAR: Jones studies his equipment. Beaumont wonders what's going on. Suddenly, Jones barks:
JONES: ( INTO MIKE )
MANCUSO: ( TO THOMPSON ) ( F IG )
IN SONAR: the COB and Jones ft+eeze. Everything's super-quiet. Beaumont
BEAUMONT: What! s ' going on, Jonesy?
JONES: ( WHISPERING )
BEAUMONT ): Skipper got him. The Russian hasn't got a clue.
FIRE CONTROL: Bearing rate has steadied. He's returning to course two-one-zero.
MAN CUSO: Very well. Secure from quiet running. RADIOMAN enters.
RADIOMAN: ( TO MANCUSO )
MANCUSO: !re not gonna believe this.
THOMPSON: !re not gonna believe this.
MANCUSO: !re not gonna believe this.
THUNDERING ROTORS: on a SH-3 on the Kennedy's flight deck. Ryan and Davenport move to the waiting chopper. Davenport SHOUTS:
DAVENPORT: The Dallas picked up Red October and is tracking her again. The Admiral issued orders for her to fall back and pick you up. Davenport takes Ryan's arm.
JEFF PELT: in his chair in his office in the Executive Office Building. Sitting on the couch in precisely the same position as when they last talked, Ambassador Lysenko wipes his brow:
LYSENKO: The weather in Washington is so unpredictable, don't you think?
PELT: How can I help you, Ambassador?
LYSENKO: I'm afraid there's been a pew Apparently, the initial reports that one of our submarines was missing were not completely accurate.
PELT: Why didn't you tell me this the last time we met?
LYSENKO: In my position, I'm sometimes compromised by the fact that Moscow doesn't tea me So one of your submarine captains has gone insane?
PELT: So one of your submarine captains has gone insane?
LYSENKO: The other day you offered your assistance
PELT: The other day it was a rescue mission. You want us to help you hunt Ramius down and kill. him?
LYSENKO: Because American lives are at stake, I've been instructed to ask your President for precisely that.
PELT: I understand. Pelt picks up the phone.
BROKEN SUNSHINE: dappling a choppy sea. Ice-cold WIND whips whitecapped waves and lashes the horizon. The helicopter with Ryan aboard circles into IN THE CHOPPER HOWLING. NOISE. PILOT and COPILOT navigate tricky winds.. TWO SAILORS crouch by an open door, checking a harness on Ryan. Tuiindng to the pi ot, the copilot BELLOWS:
COPILOT: no contact with the Da'Ha!
PILOT: We can't wait any Unger!
COPILOT: Hang on. I have contact!
PILOT: OK. Tell them to surface.
MANCUSO: Whoever this guy is, he's in far one hell of a ride.
SAILOR: Pull this to release! Fighting. panic, Ryan glances down. A mitlion miles below, the sea bans- mine-grey.
MANCUSO: You got a man dangling at the end of a line with no paint of reference and helicopter rotors generating enough static electak ty that we have to ground him or it! l be like grabbing a hot wire and if he falls in the water the only way to get him out is with divers 'cause most of the ship's underwater.
THOMPSON: ( G NING )
MANCUSO: Good. We got no idea who this guy is or why the Navy wants his on our boat so bad.
SAILOR: Hang on! He trips a laver on the winch. Cable feeds out a few feet Holding his breath, Ryan inches into the abyss.
MANCUSO: ( SCREAMING )
PILOT: Reel him back in!
SAILOR: ( TRYING )
PILOT: If they don't pick him up this time, we have to cut him Ioxe! The sailor keeps trying to rewind the cable. No go. sweating, he wraps gloved fingers around the emergency release on the drum.
MANCUSO: ( INTO PHONE )
JONES: Are. you injured!?
JONES: I'm gonna take you in through an escape trunk! Jones hooks Ryan to the line. Salt stings Ryan's eyes. His, breathing's ragged.
RYAN: Wait a minute!
JONES: Listen, you son-af-a-bit h. I'm only gonna tell you once. Stick this fucking thing in your mouth and breathe! Ryan takes the mouthpiece, inhaling and exhaling rapidly. The helicopter circles above. Jones drags Ryan
RYAN: Jesus Christ! I cant believe it! Jesus Christ Â»
MANCUSO: Take it easy
RYAN: When I hit the water, it was like Ice. I thought I was going to freeze
MANCUSO: Slow down. You're hypervent it sting.
RYAN: ( DISORIENTED )
MANCUSO: ( READING )
MANCUSO: What the hell are you yammering about?

RYAN: BUT CAPTAIN
BUT CAPTAIN: I'Il be in the Conn.
MANCUSO: I'Il be in the Conn.
MANCUSO: ( TO JONES )
JONES: No, sir, captain. operating as before. Ryan appears in dry clothes. Mancuso ignores him. The of5cer of the deck turns to Mancuso:
OOD: Captain. Battle stations are manned.
MANCUSO: Very well.
RYAN: What do you mean battle stations?
MANCUSO: And I have been ordered to blow him out of the water if he stays on a course to the United States or demonstrates any hostile intentions.
RYAN: ( STUNNED )
MANCUSO: ( RE: MESSAGE )
RYAN: ( RE: MESSAGE )
JONES: ( TO MANCUSO )
MANCUSO: All. stop i Come left and stay in his baffles. Rig for quiet running. The officer of the deck repeats Mancuso's orders. Mancuso and Ryan are eyeball-etc-eyeball.. Ryan whispers:
RYAN: Listen to me, Captain. There must be some way you can establish contact without violating your orders. I'm telling you, he wants to defect.
MANCUSO: ( after a beat ) AIL back two-thirds. Nobody moves. Jones glances at Mancuso. Mancuso stares at Ryan The ofSt r of the deck's e d
OOD: Sorry, sir. Would you repeat
MANCUSO: I said, aill back two-thirds!
HELMSMAN: Helm answers. AIL back two-thirds. Hell RINGS. Ship SHUDDERS. Ryan's ears pop. Jones glares at
MANCUSO: AIL shop!
RAMIUS: in the Conn on Red October, surrounded by activity. Urgently, he speaks into a mike:
RAMIUS: Sonar, this is Ramius. Can you identify the contact?
MANCUSO: in the Dalla' Conn, on the deck. Thompson's at fire control. Ryan is to Mancuso's left. Crew's at battle stations.
MANCUSO: Flood tubes one and two and make torpedos ready in all. respects.
RYAN: WAIT -
MANCUSO: My orders are specific, Mister.
THOMPSON: Tubes one and two flooded and ready in all respects.
RAMIUS: as before in Red. October's -Conn. The crew has come to battle stations. Borodin is at fire control..
RAMIUS: ( TO BORODIN )
BORODIN: Shall I flood the tubes?
RAMIUS: ( after a beat ) No. Lock the ( ring solution into computer. Do not flood the tubes.
MANCUSO: on the DaIIas in the Conn. Eyeing Ryan, Mancuso opens a mike:
MANCUSO: What's he doing, Jonesy? Has he l f ooded his tubes?
JONES: Negative, Captain. He's just matting there. Hold on
RYAN: What does it mean?
MANCUSO: It means, he's a very cool customer,
YOUR RUS: sian. He knows we're here and that we are ready to fire. But he's not going to provoke us. He's heading to periscope depth to see what's on the What's his course, now?
THOMPSON: ( READING )
MANCUSO: ( TO- HELMSMAN )
JONES: Conn, sonar. My only contact is Sierra thirty-five, Red October. Bearing two- Conn, aye. Fire control, range to target?
MANCUSO: Conn, aye. Fire control, range to target?
THOMPSON: Range is three hundred yards.
MANCUSO: Diving oar make your depth sixty- f f ve feet.
RAMIUS: ( ON SCOPE )
BORODIN: Weapons are armed. Tubes one and two are not ficoded.
RAMIU S: ( AT SCOPE )
QUARTERMASTER: Bearing zero-nine-zero. in the Conn, Mancuso is glued to his scope just like Ramius. Ryan can hear his heart nq:
MANCUSO: All right, Mr. Ryan. You wanted to:. talk to him. There he is. What do you want to say? Ryan chooses his words carefully. As he does, Mancuso hits a periscope light in morse:
RYAN: American government told you intend to launch mis. lc s. Do not approach U.S. coast. Repeat. Do not approach U.S. coast, or you .w>7 . be attacked. If you understand, ping once.
MANCUSO: He can do that. But is he gonna do ON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, Ramius is still at. the scope, watching the light in the Dalla' periscope. After a moment, he, glances at Borodin:
RAM=S: Verify the range again.
MANCUSO: I'D. be dammed.
RYAN: ( RE: PAD )
MANCUSO: ( READING )
RYAN: Just send it.
RAMIUS: Verify the range one more time.
BORODIN: But Captain, I just
RAMIUS: Give me a sounding, ' Vasily! Ping once only. Borodin goes to work. Ramius stares at Melekhin. Melekhin frowns. What the hell is happening?
MANCUSO: Down scope.

EXDITD ): I need to look at a nautical chart. Do you have
MANCUSO: Ryan, what's going on?
RYAN: ( 9 G )
THE DEEP: black as night, reverberating with eerie nightmares. From the cloying dark, Red October rises, a shimmering phosphorescent giant.
PETROV: ( READING BOOK )

BORODIN: Do you think they will let me live in I think they w91 let you live wherever you want, my find.
RAMIUS: I think they w91 let you live wherever you want, my find.
BORODIN: Good. Then I will raise rabbits in Montana and marry a round American
I: woman who will cook them for me.
RANIUS: Keep your vcadoe down, Doctor. There are several explanations -
PETROV: Listen to me. Radioactive fuel is in the water. If it gets into our air, it could ' loll us all!

RAMIUS: it's probably a piece of corrosion in the pipes. That happens. Now let's take' another sample. But quietly. We don't want to panic the crew.
ENGINEERING: minutes later. Melekhin and Petrov prepare to draw another sample at the sink. Ramius stands behind them. Technicians to the rear. Melekhin struggles with the valve:
MELEKHIN: I may have shut it too hard. Grabbing the wrench, Ramius leans his weight on it. Suddenly, the
RAMIUS: Evacuate the compartment-' Technicians scramble for the door. Searing hot steam chokes the compartment. Melekhin SCREAMS:

ADMIRAL GREER: in a white uniform and cap. Beside him, Skip Tyler, leans on his cane, concentrating on Curry's display.
CURRY: Torpedo has detonated.
GREER: And you understand, Lieutenant. I was never here. That torpedo did not self-destruct. It hit the target. Right?
MANCUSO: in the Conn aboard the Dallas with Thompson. Mancuso has a .45 in a holster on his belt. Thompson reads a message:
THOMPSON: Frigate reports phase one completed, Captain. We are ordered to proceed.
MANCUSO: OK. Now comes the weird part. Thompson fo lows Mancuso out of the Conn into
A PASSAGEWAY: running aft. Mancuso and Thompson move at speed. Mancuso is far
MANCUSO: I don't like leaving the boat, Phil. But the orders are specific.
THOMPSON: We're gonna be f ne. Rounding a corner, they start
MANCUSO: This has got to be the craziest stunt I've ever heard of. There's only about two ml]]k n things that can st]l. go wrong. At the bottom of the ladder, they enter
A PASSAGEWAY: Ahead of them Jones and Ryan wait by a ladder beneath an open hatch. Like Mancuso, Jones is armed. Jones starts up the ladder. Ryan follows. Mancuso turns to Thompson:
MANCUSO: Listen. If anything
THOMPSON: Captain. We'll be all right. Mancuso climbs up the ladder, disappearing through the hatch. Thompson closes it.
STEINER: OX. Passengers are aboard. Check-off complete. Request clearance to lift-off.
COPILOT: Eighty percent capacity. Homing beacon is five degrees to the right. Recommend new course zero-seven-five. Range now five hundred yards.

MANCUSO: No! That's wrong. Ryan, don't turn that goddam wheel! Ryan stares at Mancuso then at Ramius. Deciding, he turns the helm left, coming to course zero-two-zero.
RYAN: ( TOO MANCUSO )
MANCUSO: ( TO RAMIIUS )
RAMIUS: I know.
CURRY: ( EYES NARROWING )
GREER: Mother of God.
RAMIUS: ( ON MIKE ) MELEKHIN ( VO ) ( ON SPEAKERS )
THOMPSON: Why is he heading into the torpedo? Is he trying to kill himself?
COB: Mr. Thompson. We have a solution on the Soviet Akula. Shouldn't we shoot back?
THOMPSON: ( ANGRY )
RAMIUS: ( TO RYAN )
RYAN: JONES ( VO ) ( ON SPEAKERS )
RAMIUS: What books did you write?
RYAN: ( HOARSELY )
RAMIUS: I know this book. I have read some parts of it.
RYAN: What happened?
MANCUSO: Combat tack, Mr. Ryan. By turning into the torpedo,, Ramius closed the distance before it could arm itself. I never would have thought of it.
RYAN: So we're safe?
RAMIUS: Not yet. Right now, the Soviet Captain, a man named Tupolev is removing the safety features on all his weapons. He won't make the same mistake twice. Behind Ramius, Ryan spots a SHADOW at the rear of the Conn. He can't believe his eyes. The goddam shadow has a pistol in hand.
BEAUMONT: Jesus Christ. Gunge.
THOMPSON: ON THE KONOVALOV in the Conn, Tupa]av is furious. He YELLS at Bonavia:
TUPOLEV: Hurry up goddammit! I want all the enabling devices disconnected!
BONAVIA: Captain, I cannot go any faster.
BORODIN: I would have like to have seen Montana. And the Indians. ( eyes gT'âºg ) captain? - _. He dies. RAGING, Ramius POUNDS the BULKHEAD. Kamarov notices a light on a panel:
KAMAROV: He's in the missile compartment!
RAMIUS: ( TO MANCUSO )
MANCUSO: But the control is blasted to hell. I can't shoot.
RAMIUS: Then get behind him and stay there. Don't let him put you in his sights or we're all dead. Mancuso tosses Ramius his .45. Catching it, Ramius splits. Ryan a caged tiger in the Conn on the Konovalov. Bonavia turns, looking back at him :
TUPOLEV: a caged tiger in the Conn on the Konovalov. Bonavia turns, looking back at him :
BONAVIA: Enabling devices are removed.
TUPOLEV: ABOUT TIMEL ( INTO MIKE )
ABOUT TIMEL: ( INTO MIKE )
TUPOLEV: ( TO HELM )
RAMIUS: He'll break into a panel and short -circuit the wiring on a missile. We'll be blown to pieces. Taking a deep breath, Ryan follows Ramiais into the
MISSILE COMPARTMENT: coming face-too-face with a BARRAGE of GUNFIRE. Ramius is HIT. Ryan drags him into a space behind an electrical panel. Mercifully, the shooting STOPS. Ryan checks Ramius. His shoulder's a mess. Mind riling, Ryan studies his surroundings. He's never felt so alone. The compartment is vast, dominated by twenty tussle tubes six feet in diameter. Overhead, a catwalk. At the aft end, somebody's working with a wrench.
RAMIUS: We must stop him before he gets into a panel.. Ryan stares at Ramius. Ramiii isn't gonna stop anybody. Resigned, Ryan finds the .45 Mancuso gave him in his pocket,
RYAN: ( TO HIMSELF )
RAMIUS: Be careful what you shoot at in here, Ryan. The compartment is very sensitive. In a daze, Ryan starts walking aft, still MUMBLING:
RYAN: Be careful what you shoot at, Ryan. Very sensitive.. .in here.
MANCUSO: ( TO KAMAROV )
RYAN: Sensitive stuff.in here .I have to. be careful. of course. The ship turns. Wall becomes cuing. Grabbing the catwalk, Ryan hangs at a ninety degree angle. GUNFIRE. Bullets RIP into the BULKHEAD inches from his HEAD:
CURRY: The Akula is too fast. No way Red October can stay behind her. lt's only a matter of time now.
JONES: Another torpedo, Captain. It has enabled and is active. It has acquired us and is Red October looms into view. To the right, the Konovalov shimmers in the dark. Between them, the torpedo appears. PINGS grow CLOSER and CLOSER. At the last minute
THE DEEP: Red October looms into view. To the right, the Konovalov shimmers in the dark. Between them, the torpedo appears. PINGS grow CLOSER and CLOSER. At the last minute
THE DALLAS: raves into view, rocketing forward at full, bore, streaking between Red October and the torpedo. it's really something.
CURRY: Jesus Chi i t.
GREER: The Dallas has moved between Red October and the torpedo. The torpedo is chasing the Dallas now!
I: The Dallas has moved between Red October and the torpedo. The torpedo is chasing the Dallas now!
CURRY: The Dallas has moved between Red October and the torpedo. The torpedo is chasing the Dallas now!
BEAUMONT: Conn, sonar. Torpedo is in acquisition. Range five hundred yards and c3nsing. You've done it, Mr. Thompson!
THOMPSON: Chief, release counter-measures and emergency blow all main valves. Let's hope to Christ this works!
COB: ( ON PHONE} ( PULLING HANDLES )
IT'S LOGINOV: the cook's assistant who witnessed the Putin key exchange. He's got a hot wire in each hand. Time stands sthl. Ryan stares at Loginov. Loginov stares back. There's something in the Loginov's eyes, an uncompromising, irrational vi lainy that asks no forgiveness. For a moment, Ryan's paralyzed, a rabbit before a cobra. Deliberately, Loginov begins to move his hands together, bringing the wires closer. Ryan tri es to speak. He can't. Loginov's grin cracks wide like a rotten egg.
RYAN FIRES: Flame LEAPS from the BARREL of the .45. The pistol KICKS like a MULE. Loginov is delivered to eternity. Impotent, the wires fall to the floor.
BONAVIA: Directly ahead. Range five hundred yards.
TUPOLEV: Got him. Match bearings and the.
BONAVIA: We are too close. I have to set
TUPOLEV: Shoot now! Tupolev pulls the lever himself.
MANCUSO: Left full rudder!
JONES: ( LOUDER PINGS )
TUPOLEV: Wait. I -
TUPOLEV: ( STUNNED )
BONAVIA: The weapon was not properly programmed. PINGS CLOSER. LOUDER. Finally, PINGS become a SPINE- TINGLTNG HOWL. Bonavia SHOUTS:
RAMIUS: Captain Tupalev has just provided your pantomime with the one thing you could never have managed.
RYAN: ( NODDING ) CUT TO:
PELT: in his office seated across from Lysenko:
PELT: With the depth of the water and the wreckage scattered over such a wide area, it we]. be a long time before anything is recovered. Your people are already interviewing the crew and making arrangements for their r turn. ( Lysenko nods,
SOBERLY ): This has been a terrible tragedy, Mr. Ambassador. I can only stress that if you'd come to us earlier, it might have been avcdded.
LYSENKO: I appreciate your candor in the matter.
PELT: ( SMOOTHLY )
LYSENKO: ( PROBING )
PELT: ( STEADY )
LYSENKO: There is another matter. One I am reluctant to -
PELT: No. Please go ahead.
LYSENKO: One of our submarines, an Akula, was last reported in the Reykjanes Ridge. We have not heard from her for sometime. Pelt stares at him blankly, time hangs suspended. Finally, Peat reaches far the bridge of his now as if to stave of a ]dtler
PELT: You've lost another submarine?
A DRIVER: standing beside a limousine outside the Executive Office Building. Fuming, Lysenko approaches. The driver smiles. Not a good idea.
LYSENKO: Shut up! Don't speak to me Boris. Don't ever speak to me unless I speak to you first. And wipe that smile off your face! Lysenko pBe into the limo, slamming the door as hard as he can. Locked inside, he starts shouting and hitting things.
BRIGHT MOONLIGHT: on the tree studded bank of a large coastal river. A gentle breeze touches the trees and punctuates the silence. Crickets and frogs sing on the shore:
PAMLICO SOUND: NORTH CAROLINA
NORTH CAROLINA: THE RED OCTOBER glides quietly up the river's surface. Ramius and Ryan stand on the sail. Behind them, two junior officers, one American and one Russian, Conn the ship:
RYAN: We're two hundred miles from the nearest naval base.
RAMIUS: Interesting notion, hiding a submarine in a river.
RYAN: I grew up not far from here.
RAMIUS: There is one question you have not asked me.
RYAN: ( RAMIUS NODS )
RAMIUS: We. are standing on part of the reason. I've spent my life preparing to fight a war I hoped would never happen. This ship was not built to fight such a war. it was built to start one.
RYAN: Your wife?
RAMIUS: ( NODDING )
RYAN: Taking a deep breath, Ramius studies the surrounding hills. Lights from farms twinkle in the night air.
RAMTUS: Taking a deep breath, Ramius studies the surrounding hills. Lights from farms twinkle in the night air.
RYAN: ( QU`EDY )
A STEWARDESS: walking down the aisle of an airplane, checking passengers. Stopping near the front of the cabin, she glances down at
RYAN: sound asleep in his seat, empty tea cup on a tray beside him. A blanket hangs on one log. In the seat next to him
FADE OUT: THE END
