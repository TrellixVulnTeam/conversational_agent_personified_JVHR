GUIDE VOICE: It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. A small square image appears on screen. Home video. The dolphin stadium at Sea World.
END TITLES: As night turns to morning, we hear CLICK, then.
ARTHUR: ( into phone ) What do you mean he's gone out to lunch? You just said he was still at breakfast!
PROSSER: Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie in front of the bulldozers forever.
ARTHUR: I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.
PROSSER: This bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built. You should have made your protest months ago.
ARTHUR: The first I heard of it was when a workman came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to clean the windows, and he said he'd come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me right away of course. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid. Then he told me.
PROSSER: Look. These plans have been on display at the planning office now for a year.
ARTHUR: On display? I had to go down to a cellar!
PROSSER: That's the display department.
ARTHUR: I eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard'.
PROSSER: Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?
ARTHUR: How much?
PROSSER: None at all.
ARTHUR: He leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop.
FORD: Arthur! There you are. Here drink and eat with me. We need to talk.
ARTHUR: Er, um.now's not the best time, Ford They're going to demolish my home,
FORD: Whoa. You already know? How?
ARTHUR: But what about my house?
FORD: C'mon. Let's go to the pub. He said they won't destroy your house until they've finished the beers.
ARTHUR: Can we trust him?
FORD: I'd trust him to the end of the Earth.
ARTHUR: And how far's that?
FORD: About twelve minutes away.
FORD: Six pints of bitter. And quickly. The world's about to end.
BARMAN: Oh yes, sir? Nice weather for it.
ARTHUR: Well, when does he get back from lunch? Or is he going straight out for tea?!
FORD: It's about to get a lot crappier.
BARMAN: There you are, six pints.
FORD: Keep the change. You've got ten minutes to spend it.
ARTHUR: Three? At lunchtime?
FORD: Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.
ARTHUR: Very deep. You should send that in to the Reader's Digest. They've got a page for people like you.
FORD: Drink up.
ARTHUR: Why three pints?
FORD: Muscle relaxant. And eat these. You'll need the salt.
ARTHUR: What's going on. Ford?
FORD: What would you say if I told you I wasn't really from Guilford but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Why, is it the sort of thing you're likely to say?
ARTHUR: Why, is it the sort of thing you're likely to say?
FORD: Remember when we met? That car was racing toward me, I was trying to greet it, you pushed me out of the way?
FORD: Didn't you find it a little strange that I was trying to shake hands with a car?
ARTHUR: I assumed you were drunk.
FORD: ( shaking his head ) I thought cars were the dominant life form. I was trying to introduce myself.
ARTHUR: And that's why you're named after a discontinued car from the seventies?
FORD: ( nodding ) You saved my life that day. Now I'm saving yours.
ARTHUR: This must be Thursday. I never could get the hang of Thursdays.
FORD: Look, if it's about your house.
ARTHUR: No, it's not that. It's..
FORD: This isn't a long story, is it? We've only got six minutes.
ARTHUR: At that flat in Islington. I told you about it. Last week, remember?
ARTHUR: I'm Arthur. Arthur Dent.
TRICIA: No, I mean who are you?
ARTHUR: Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um. Livingston, I presume. Granted. Not as clever as Darwin, but the best I could do on short notice.
TRICIA: You're the first person who's got it right. Everyone keeps calling me Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious.
ARTHUR: Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious.
ARTHUR: Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious.
TRICIA: I've got so many degrees I am officially unemployable. Let's drink to that!
TRICIA: Let's go somewhere.
ARTHUR: Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There's a lovely little cafe around the corner.
TRICIA: I was thinking Madagascar.
ARTHUR: Is that a new club on Dean Street?
TRICIA: No. It's a country. Off the coast of Oh, that Madagascar. Right, off we go Good God, you're serious.
ARTHUR: Oh, that Madagascar. Right, off we go Good God, you're serious.
TRICIA: Quit. Get a new one when we return.
ARTHUR: I can't just.what about my house? Who would feed my dog?
TRICIA: Bring him with.
ARTHUR: He's a Welsh Collie. He'd feel all out of place in Madagascar.
ARTHUR: "Would you like to see my spaceship?" Really, what sort of chat up line is that?
FORD: More popular than you'd think.
ARTHUR: I've left messages, sent letters. It's like she's vanished off the face of the
FORD: Hey, it happens. Speaking of. We've got two minutes. So drink up.
ARTHUR: My house!
FORD: A round for everyone, on me.
BARMAN: You really think the world's going to end? Shouldn't we lie down or put a bag over our heads or something?
FORD: If you want.
BARMAN: Will it help?
FORD: Not really.
BARMAN: Last orders, then?
ARTHUR: STOP! STOP, YOU BASTARDS!!
FORD: Ships from a Vogon Constructor Fleet. I picked up their signal this morning.
FORD {CONT'D}: Here. You'll need this.
JELTZ: .and, unfortunately, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes. Thank you.
TECHNICIAN: Hello! Can you hear us? Please respond!
VOGON CAPTAIN: ( through juke box ) What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? Oh, for heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout.
JELTZ: Apathetic bloody planet, I've no sympathy at all. Energize the demolition beams.
GUIDE VOICE: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book.
PERSON, ANYWAY?: Now the images rise up from the screen like holographs as the book "presents itself" like some hi-tech infomercial.
ARTHUR: So you're not from Guilford, which would explain the accent which I've always wondered about.and you're not an out of work actor but rather a writer for this.this.book thing.
FORD: Here. Eat these. If you've never been through a transmat beam before you've probably lost some salt and protein.
ARTHUR: If I asked where we were would I regret
FORD: We're safe. For now.
ARTHUR: We're in a storage hold in one of the ships of the Vogon constructor fleet .
FORD: We're in a storage hold in one of the ships of the Vogon constructor fleet .
ARTHUR: Obviously some strange usage of the word safe I wasn't previously aware of.
FORD: ( not getting the sarcasm ) Is it?
ARTHUR: Tell me you're joking.
FORD: Okay. I'm joking.
ARTHUR: And do a reassuring little laugh.
FORD: In the storage hold of a Vogon constructor
ARTHUR: Get me home. Ford.
FORD: Home? Arthur.your home. is.
ARTHUR: Oh God - it was demolished! I've got to reach my lawyer! He must be back from lunch by now.
FORD: You don't remember, do you? Okay. I've got something to tell you. It ain't gonna be easy, but you're gonna have to just deal, okay?
ARTHUR: Good god. Is this really the interior of a flying saucer?
FORD: Yeah. Why?
ARTHUR: Blown up? BLOWN UP?! Couldn't you have done something?!!
FORD: I did. I saved you.
ARTHUR: But there's six billion other people.
FORD: And all those ants.
ARTHUR: Yes, but ants aren't exactly people!
FORD: And now you're thinking like a Vogon. I saved your life, okay? Which makes us even. Next thing.
ARTHUR: What's a Vogon?
FORD: Ask the guide. Say "Vogons."
ARTHUR: The word "VOGONS" floats up into his field of vision.
GUIDE VOICE: ( CONTINUED )
FORD: They can't think, they can't imagine, most of them can't even spell. They just run And if we don't get a ride soon, you won't b need the guide to illustrate just how unpleasant the Vogons can be. They've destroyed a planet today, that always makes them a little feisty.
ARTHUR: It can't be gone. It can't be!
FORD: GUIDE VOICE
ARTHUR: GUIDE VOICE
EARTH!!: GUIDE VOICE
GUIDE VOICE: An image of the Earth appears on the Guide's screen.
ARTHUR: That's it? That's all this idiotic book has to say about my home? "Harmless?"
FORD: Hey, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy and only a limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors. No one knew much about Earth. That's why I was there. To expand the entry. I fired off a new one to the editor before I got What does it say now?
ARTHUR: What does it say now?
FORD: Mostly harmless.
ARTHUR: Ahhh, what the hell is that?!
FORD: Here. Put this in your ear.
ARTHUR: WHAT?.STOP!..DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH.
ARTHUR: Argh! What's happening.?
FORD: The fish. It's translating for you.
VOGON GUARD: Resistance is useless!
GUIDE VOICE: The Babelfish is small, yellow, leechlike, and probably the oddest thing in the
GUIDE VOICE: It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing unconscious frequencies and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to the speech centres of the brain, the practical upshot of which is that if you stick one in your ear, you instantly understand anything said to you in any language.
VOGON GUARD: Resistance is useless!
ARTHUR: Don't panic. If we're lucky, they'll throw us out into space.
FORD: Don't panic. If we're lucky, they'll throw us out into space.
ARTHUR: And if we're unlucky?
JELTZ: Oh freddled gruntbuggly! Thy suppurations are to me as plerdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.
GUIDE VOICE: Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the third worst in the universe.
JELTZ: Or I shall rend thee In the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheaon, see if I don't!
GUIDE VOICE: The absolute worst poetry was written by Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussix. It involved decaying swans. Luckily, it was destroyed when the Earth was.
JELTZ: So, Earthlings, I present you with a simple choice. Either die in the vacuum of space, or tell what you thought of my poem.
ARTHUR: Actually.I rather liked it.
FORD: Good tact. Run with it.
ARTHUR: Um.some of the words I didn't understand, but I found the imagery quite effective.
JELTZ: Continue. . .
ARTHUR: And, um, interesting rhythmic devices which seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the humanity.
FORD: . Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity of the poet's soul, which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate, er.
ARTHUR: . Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity of the poet's soul, which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate, er.
FORD: . whatever it was .
ARTHUR: . the poem was about.
FORD: I think you just saved my life again.
ARTHUR: I think you just saved my life again.
FORD: I think you just saved my life again.
JELTZ: An astute analysis. Very impressive. Throw them off the ship.
VOGON GUARD: Resistance is useless!
JELTZ: Hmph. "Counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor." Death's too good for them.
ARTHUR: So this is it? We're going to die?
FORD: Yes. No, wait! What's this switch? No, it's nothing. We are going to die.
ARTHUR: You know, it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.
FORD: Why? What did you she tell you?
ARTHUR: I don't know. I didn't listen.
FORD: You're sweating.
GUIDE VOICE: "Space." says the introduction to the Hitchhikers Guide, ".is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the market, but that's just peanuts compared to space." and so on.
ARTHUR: I think I'm a sofa.
FORD: I think I'm a sofa.
ARTHUR: I think I'm a sofa.
FORD: I think I know how you feel.
TRILLIAN: Four to one against and falling.
TRILLIAN: ( into microphone ) Probability factor of one to one.we have normality, I repeat we have normality. Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem. Please relax. You will be sent for soon.
ZAPHOD: Hey. Do you mind? I can't hear.
TRILLIAN: Can we put your ego aside for one moment? Something important has happened.
ZAPHOD: If there's anything more important than my ego on this ship, I want it caught and shot now.
GAG HALFRRUNT: Vell, Zaphod's just zis guy, you know
ZAPHOD: We have a couple of hitchhikers in our receiving bay.
TRILLIAN: We have a couple of hitchhikers in our receiving bay.
ZAPHOD: When you engaged the Improbability Drive.
TRILLIAN: When you engaged the Improbability Drive.
ZAPHOD: I didn't engage the drive.
TRILLIAN: We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha where you picked me up.
ZAPHOD: That's impossible.
TRILLIAN: No. Just very, very improbable.
ZAPHOD: I don't have time for this! We've got the police of half the Galaxy after us and we stop to pick up hitchhikers?! Okay, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, eh?
TRILLIAN: Don't. I'll send Marvin. ( calling )
MARVIN: I think you ought to know I'm feeling very We have something to take your mind off
TRILLIAN: We have something to take your mind off
MARVIN: It won't work, I have an exceptionally large mind.
TRILLIAN: I know. Go down to the number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here.
MARVIN: Just that?
TRILLIAN: I won't enjoy it.
MARVIN: I won't enjoy it.
ZAPHOD: She's not asking you to enjoy it. Just do it will you?
MARVIN: All right. I'll do it.
TRILLIAN: No, no, Marvin, it's fine really. It's just part of life.
MARVIN: Life. Don't talk to me about life.
DOOR: 33 EXT. DEEP SPACE - NIGHT 33
VOGON CAPTAIN: Commander Kwaltz. We've located the spaceship Heart of Gold and President Beeblebrox. Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. Requesting hyperspace clearance.
KWALTZ: Get me the vice-president.
ARTHUR: Now this is more like my idea of a spaceship. Look at all these buttons.
FORD: They listen. Hear footsteps.
DOOR: Thank you for using this door. I've enjoyed opening for you. Hhmmyaahh.
DOOR: What a pleasure it is to open for you. I will gladly close for you now.
MARVIN: "All the doors in this spacecraft have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done. Hateful, isn't it? You can thank the Marketing Division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation for building robots with GPP.
ARTHUR: "Genuine People Personalities." I'm a personality prototype. You can tell can't Er. . .
GPP?: "Genuine People Personalities." I'm a personality prototype. You can tell can't Er. . .
MARVIN: "Genuine People Personalities." I'm a personality prototype. You can tell can't Er. . .
ARTHUR: Er. . .
MARVIN: Sorry, did I say something wrong? Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway, so I don't know why I even bother to say it. Oh god, I'm so depressed.
ARTHUR: Really? Wonder why?
FORD: ( aside to Arthur ) Probably because he's so negative.
ARTHUR: Yes, I know. I was being.never mind.
MARVIN: I've brought the aliens. Don't thank me or anything.
ZAPHOD: Arthur and Ford throw their hands up. Marvin doesn't.
MARVIN: Do you mean sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where I'm standing?
ZAPHOD: I wasn't talking to you.
FORD: Ixxie? It is you! IXXIE!
ZAPHOD: Ixxie? It is you! IXXIE!
FORD: I don't know! Just stuck out the thumb and here I am.
ZAPHOD: That is so you.
FORD: And look at you! President? Last time I saw you, you were a beach bum.
ZAPHOD: Is it a great galaxy or what? I still can't believe this. Ixxie! Here!
FORD: Hey, it's Ford now.
ZAPHOD: My name. It's Ford Prefect. Picked it up on Earth. Sorta grew on me.
FORD: My name. It's Ford Prefect. Picked it up on Earth. Sorta grew on me.
ZAPHOD: Okay "Ford" you zarking frood.
FORD: Oh, this is Arthur. Arthur, this is Zaphod Beeblebrox. My cousin? Semi-half He shares three of the same mothers as me.
ZAPHOD: He shares three of the same mothers as me.
ARTHUR: We've met.
ZAPHOD: Have we? Sorry. I've got a terrible memory for species.
TRILLIAN: Everything okay?
ZAPHOD: Hey, hon. Come here. You won't believe this. Ix.um, sorry."Ford".this is.
ARTHUR: Tricia McMillan?
TRILLIAN: ( CONTINUED )
ARTHUR: ( completely bewildered ) I can't believe this.I've been looking.and you're here? I went to get wine and.
TRILLIAN: I know. And it was rude to just leave, but I told you I wanted to get away, and he had a spaceship parked outside, well, honestly I assumed you were a sort of stay-at-home-and-read-a book type. But you're here.
ARTHUR: Actually I am that type. But.well you do know what happened, don't you?
ZAPHOD: Ford picked him up, they hitched a ride, and here we all are. Now, enough small talk, Trill. We're on the run, remember? I stole a ship?
ARTHUR: We're having a bit of a chat if you don't
FORD: There's the Zaphod I remember.
FORD: I thought you said you stole it.
TRILLIAN: Are you all right?
ARTHUR: I feel like a bloody idiot. I've spent all week looking for Tricia McMillan and that isn't even your name.
TRILLIAN: It is my name. I shortened it.
ARTHUR: Well, I'm still Arthur. Just plain average one-headed doesn't-own-a-space ship Arthur. Sorry to disappoint.
TRILLIAN: A very eager male COMPUTER VOICE ( EDDIE ) sounds.
EDDIE: Hi, guys, this is Eddie your shipboard computer and I just know I'm gonna get a bundle of kicks out of any program you want to run through me.
TRILLIAN: Can you identify our pursuers?
EDDIE: I'd be happy to! Stand by, please. Hey, guys, I'm just pleased as punch to report that it's a fleet of a hundred Vogon Battle Destroyers. You must be super important to warrant such an effort, and gee am I impressed. They're sending a message. I'd be super happy to play it.
EDDIE: Sure thing, fella, but I should tell you we need proper authorization before entering a hyperspace expressway.
FORD: Brace yourself. This is a bit like being What's so bad about being drunk?
ARTHUR: What's so bad about being drunk?
FORD: Ask a glass of water.
KWALTZ: Did they have proper hyperspace No, Commander.
VOGON WORKER: No, Commander.
KWALTZ: Add that to their list of offences! Blatant disregard for protocol.
QUESTULAR: You do realize he did what he did because he knew this is what you would do.
KWALTZ: Rules are rules, Mr. Vice President. And they are made to be followed.
QUESTULAR: Don't you think this many ships is a bit, oh I don't know excessive?
KWALTZ: The provisions are clear. Under subsection 37a these are the forces we deploy to protect the president in the case of an attempted or actual kidnapping-
QUESTULAR: You are aware, Commander, that the President kidnapped himself.
KWALTZ: He puts the two books together, slams them down.
QUESTULAR: Do you have any idea how ridiculous this I don't have ideas Mr. Vice President. I just do what I do.
KWALTZ: I don't have ideas Mr. Vice President. I just do what I do.
ZAPHOD: So you along for the ride or am I dropping you somewhere?
FORD: ( still wary of the two heads ) Depends. Where you going?
ZAPHOD: Into the pages of history, cousin. And when you see what I'm about to show you, you'll beg me to take you with us.
TRILLIAN: You okay?
ARTHUR: Normally I would say "I'll live," but given the circumstances. Is there any tea on this spaceship?
TRILLIAN: This way.
ZAPHOD: Hey, apeman. Earthman. I'm sorry, what was your name again?
ARTHUR: ( CONTINUED )
ZAPHOD: Right. No hard feelings, okay? And sorry to hear about your planet, but don't mention it to the girl because if you do
FORD: Two heads. Interesting choice.
ZAPHOD: Apparently you can't be President with a whole brain.
FORD: So you carved it up?
ZAPHOD: Yes I think. And I think I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the Government screening tests or by me. So, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is I don't know. Obviously. But I put a few things together and that's when I realized I had this.
TRILLIAN: I suppose I should have said it resembles tea.
ARTHUR: So two heads is what does it for a girl, then? I mean, if I'd had two heads. Or Or your own space ship.
TRILLIAN: Or your own space ship.
ARTHUR: Anything else he's got two of?
TRILLIAN: Come on, Arthur, don't be like that.
ARTHUR: Well, what am I supposed to be like? Green? Bleeping? What?
TRILLIAN: Just be yourself. Have some fun. Does it No, I suppose it wouldn't..
ARTHUR: No, I suppose it wouldn't..
TRILLIAN: I mean.
ARTHUR: So all that's left is me and you, "mostly harmless," and two lab rats.
TRILLIAN: Can it keep? You might want to see this.
ZAPHOD: and when I saw what I'm about to show you, that's when I realized why I did what I did to my brain or it least, I think that's why.
DEEP THOUGHT: ( deep and sonorous ) What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer of all time have been called into existence?
LUNKWILL: Your task, O computer.
FOOK: Hang on. Did you say second greatest?
DEEP THOUGHT: Second greatest. Yes.
FOOK: But we designed you to be the greatest computer so you could.
LUNKWILL: You're not talking about the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond?
DEEP THOUGHT: The Milliard Gargantubrain? A mere abacus, mention it not.
FOOK: The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler then?
DEEP THOUGHT: The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler could argue all four legs off an Arcturan Megadonkey, but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards.
FOOK: Then what's the problem?
DEEP THOUGHT: I am the greatest computer you are able to design without my help. Which, one day, you are going to need.
LUNKWILL: ( to Fook ) Let's just ask the question.
FOOK: Oh Deep Thought, your task is this. We want you to tell us the Answer.
DEEP THOUGHT: The Answer.to what?
LUNKWILL: You know. The answer. To Life.the We'd really like an answer. Something simple. Can you do it?
FOOK: We'd really like an answer. Something simple. Can you do it?
DEEP THOUGHT: The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. Yes. There is an answer. But I'll have to think about it.
FORD: That's it?
ZAPHOD: No, no. There's more. They go back.
ARTHUR: Seven and a half million years later?
DEEP THOUGHT: Can I help you?
FOOK: Deep Thought. Do you have.
DEEP THOUGHT: An answer for you? Yes. I have.
FOOK: There really is an answer?
DEEP THOUGHT: Yes. There really is one.
FOOK: ( almost strangled with emotion ) Can you tell us what it is?
LUNKWILL: Can you tell us what it is?
DEEP THOUGHT: Yes. Though I don't think you're going to like it.
FOOK: Doesn't matter! We must know it!
DEEP THOUGHT: You're really not going to like it.
FOOK: Tell us!
DEEP THOUGHT: Alright. The answer to the ultimate question .
LUNKWILL: Yes .
DEEP THOUGHT: . of Life, the Universe, and Everything .
FOOK: DEEP THOUGHT . is .
DEEP THOUGHT: . is .
CROWD: Yes .!
DEEP THOUGHT: ( longest pause yet ) Forty two.
LUNKWILL: But it was the Question. The Ultimate Yes, but what actually is it?
DEEP THOUGHT: Yes, but what actually is it?
LUNKWILL: Give us the Ultimate Question then!!
DEEP THOUGHT: I can't. But there is one who can. A computer that is to come after me, one that I will design. A computer to calculate the Ultimate Question, one of such infinite complexity that life itself will form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new more primitive forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten million year program. I shall design this computer for you. And it shall be called.
FORD: That's it?
ZAPHOD: That's it.
FORD: You're looking for the Ultimate Question?
ZAPHOD: No, I tried that. "Why?" "Forty-two." Doesn't work. Let's get her ready, babe.
FORD: No, I tried that. "Why?" "Forty-two." Doesn't work. Let's get her ready, babe.
ZAPHOD: No, I tried that. "Why?" "Forty-two." Doesn't work. Let's get her ready, babe.
FORD: No, I tried that. "Why?" "Forty-two." Doesn't work. Let's get her ready, babe.
ZAPHOD: No, I tried that. "Why?" "Forty-two." Doesn't work. Let's get her ready, babe.
FORD: I mean, why do you want to know the Ultimate Question?
ZAPHOD: Oh. Well partly the curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly I think it's for the fame and the money.
ARTHUR: But you're President of the Galaxy, aren't you?
ZAPHOD: Yes, Arman.
ARTHUR: Whatever. Presidential fame is temporary, I find the Question, that's permanent. It sticks. Plus everyone thinks you're deep.
ZAPHOD: Whatever. Presidential fame is temporary, I find the Question, that's permanent. It sticks. Plus everyone thinks you're deep.
FORD: But you don't know the name of the computer that other computer was talking Which is why I'm going there.
ZAPHOD: Which is why I'm going there.
FORD: There. To find Deep Thought. On Magrathea!? Magrathea is a myth, a No, it isn't. It's real, cousin. And this is the only ship in the universe that can get you there.
ZAPHOD: There. To find Deep Thought. On Magrathea!? Magrathea is a myth, a No, it isn't. It's real, cousin. And this is the only ship in the universe that can get you there.
FORD: Magrathea!? Magrathea is a myth, a No, it isn't. It's real, cousin. And this is the only ship in the universe that can get you there.
ZAPHOD: No, it isn't. It's real, cousin. And this is the only ship in the universe that can get you there.
FORD: ( realizing ) You mean to tell me you carved up your brain so you could become President so you would get invited to the launching ceremony of this ship.so you could steal it. so you could go to Magrathea which, according to most sane people, doesn't even exist?
ZAPHOD: Why this ship? What's so special about
FORD: Why this ship? What's so special about
ARTHUR: Why this ship? What's so special about
ZAPHOD: I don't seem to be letting myself in on any of my secrets.
FORD: ( reading ) Infinite Improbability Drive? So they finally built one that works. And that's how we got picked up.
ZAPHOD: Exactly. And I'm guessing if we hit that button we go to Magrathea.
ARTHUR: You're guessing?
ZAPHOD: Hey, anyone who's not up for that, there's the door. Now who's in?
FORD: For a trip to a place that doesn't exist? I'm in. My editor will think I'm crazy, but what the hell he already thinks I'm
TRILLIAN: Definitely. I'm in.
ARTHUR: Do I even have a choice?
ZAPHOD: Arthur looks at the button.
ARTHUR: What exactly does an Infinite Improbability Drive do?
THIS!!: Zaphod's third arm shoots out and smacks the button.
GUIDE VOICE: The Infinite Improbability Drive is a new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace. As soon as the drive reaches Infinite Improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable Universe almost simultaneously, then selects the appropriate re-entry point. The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub- Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were of course well understood.
GUIDE VOICE: Such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the Theory of
KWALTZ: Well, Captain.?
GUIDE VOICE: Many respectable physicists said they weren't going to stand for that sort of thing partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.
VOGON CAPTAIN: We had them sir. These are the coordinates. But they're not here.
KWALTZ: I can see that. WHERE ARE THEY?
KNITTED ZAPHOD: ( clutching stomach ) Is this going to happen every time we hit that button?
KNITTED TRILLIAN: Very probably, yes.
ARTHUR: Did it work? Are we there?
ZAPHOD: Yes!.I think. Computer?
EDDIE: Hi, fella!
TRILLIAN: Computer? What planet is that, please?
EDDIE: On-hold Muzak plays. They all sit and listen for a few beats, then Arthur yelps.
CHECKING!!: On-hold Muzak plays. They all sit and listen for a few beats, then Arthur yelps.
ARTHUR: ( spinning around to Zaphod ) Did you just pluck a hair from my head?
OW!!: ( spinning around to Zaphod ) Did you just pluck a hair from my head?
EDDIE: Thanks for waiting, everyone. I'm just tickled pink to tell you we are currently in orbit around the planet Viltvodle 6.
VOGON CAPTAIN: Sir, the Heart of Gold has just requested permission to land on Viltvodle 6. Should I pursue?
VOGON CAPTAIN: Yes, commander.
VOGON CAPTAIN: Requesting hyperspace clearance to pursue the fugitive, sir.
KWALTZ: ( into microphone ) Bring me the request to pursue fugitive
QUESTULAR: This is ridiculous! What do you need, an executive order? Fine. I order you. Stop doing this! Go and get him!
KWALTZ: According to Subsection 94b, paragraph 2, you're not authorized to make such an But I'm acting president!
QUESTULAR: But I'm acting president!
KWALTZ: Then act like a president, and do nothing.
ARTHUR: Why does he keep saying that?
TRILLIAN: I don't know. I'm not used to seeing him this way.
ARTHUR: You mean fully clothed?
TRILLIAN: Clearly unlike any guy I've ever met. Look, if you're going to pout your way around space, then maybe you should just go home.
ARTHUR: I can't. That's the whole point and I've been trying to tell you.
FORD: ( interrupting ) Hey, look what I found in the guide.
ARTHUR: She deserves to know.
FORD: But if you tell her and she ends up with you because you're literally the last guy on Earth you'll always doubt her
ARTHUR: Do I need it?
FORD: Only always.
GUIDE VOICE: In the beginning, the universe was created. This made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.
ZAPHOD: I'll handle this.
HUMMA KAVULA: The handkerchief is coming, beloveds. Are you ready? Let us pray that the almighty will exhale a breath of compassion on us.
ZAPHOD: Hello, Humma.
ARTHUR: That's Humma Kavula? I thought he was just using a swear word.
FORD: ( shaking his head ) Humma Kavula was his opponent in the election. Something happened during the campaign. Zaphod never forgave him.
ARTHUR: What was it?
HUMMA KAVULA: ( wrapping up the prayer ) Send the handkerchief, lord, so that it may wipe us clean. We ask this in your precious holy name.
CONGREGATION: And they all sneeze. Akin to crossing himself, Humma raises a hand to his nose, then down again.
HUMMA KAVULA: Bless you.
HUMMA KAVULA: Zaphod Beeblebrox, our famous President. The Arkleseizure has exhaled many blessings upon you. What brings you to our humble planet?
ZAPHOD: I think you know why I'm here.
HUMMA KAVULA: I don't think I do.
ZAPHOD: Oh, I think you think you don't, but we both know you do.
HUMMA KAVULA: Elequent as always, Zaphod. Your ability to communicate a clear thought never ceases to amaze.
HUMKA KAVULA: ( re: the heads ) Interesting. And I don't know what you're talking about.
HUMMA KAVULA: This Humma you speak of no longer exists. He came here in his consolation position as Ambassador to Gamma Z10 to squelch an ideological threat to the system and repented from his wicked ways. He now goes by the holy name Tazelo the Unceasingly Righteous, given to him by his devoted followers.
ZAPHOD: Thank you.
ARTHUR: Why do I get the feeling he's going to get us all killed?
FORD: Probably because it's very possible. Just don't save me, okay? We're even.
HUMMA KAVULA: The election is ancient history, Zaphod, but if memory serves you won, proving that good looks and charm win over brilliance and ability to govern.
ZAPHOD: That's really not the point.
HUMMA KAVULA: You haven't come halfway across the galaxy to settle a campaign grudge. Why are you here, Zaphod?
ZAPHOD: ( wincing ) I don't know. I was headed for Magrathea, I ended up here.
HUMMA KAVULA: How very, very.
ZAPHOD: HUMMA KAVULA
HUMMA KAVULA: A gun.
ZAPHOD: A gun?
HUMMA KAVULA: A very special gun. Designed by the greatest computer ever invented, now buried in the bowels of Magrathea.
ZAPHOD: Fine. I'll get your gun. Just give me the coordinates.
HUMMA KAVULA: And what will you give me to insure your My word as President.
ZAPHOD: My word as President.
HUMMA KAVULA: Ha! I'd be better off with the dung of a Bethusian Mega Donkey.
ZAPHOD: Okay, then I'll get you that.
HUMMA KAVULA: I need a hostage, something you hold dear. Only what does Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?
HUMMA KAVULA: You should quit while you're "a head" Zaphod. No one has ever got passed the Magrathean defence system alive.
ARTHUR: Are we sure this is the right way?
FORD: Yes! I think. I don't know. Maybe not.
ARTHUR: Yes, thank you for clearing that up.
CROWD: Mr. President!.Zaphod, over here!.I want to have your baby!, etc.
FORD: Back to the ship. Quickly.
KWALTZ: Fire upon the kidnapper!
ZAPHOD: Zarquon! Friendly fire! Well, if that's what they want
QUESTULAR: Commander! The President is the Cease fire!
KWALTZ: Cease fire!
ARTHUR: Oh God, I really hate Thursdays.
FORD: Zaphod, what do we do?
ZAPHOD: Build bridges between the stars! He holds up two peace signs, a la Nixon.
ARTHUR: I think that was his campaign slogan.
FORD: I think that was his campaign slogan.
TRILLIAN: Alright, follow me. She aims the can at Zaphod's ear- Arthur's face registers the madness of the moment.
QUESTULAR: There they are!
TRILLIAN: Back off or I'll kill him, I swear I will!
KWALTZ: Could that actually kill him?
ADMIRERS: Mr. President, Mr. President!.
FEMALE ADMIRER: I totally voted for you!
ZAPHOD: Thank you!
KWALTZ: Get her!
VOGON POLICE: Resistance is useless!
ARTHUR: Ford, with Zaphod in tow, shoves Arthur forward, using his towel to clear a path through the mist. They see the Heart of Gold ramp descending from the belly of the ship.
FORD: This way!
ARTHUR: NO!! TRICIA!!!
KWALTZ: Bring her to Vogsphere for processing,
QUESTULAR: They're coming here!? But they've only accomplished half the mission. What about Zaphod? HE MUST FACE JUSTICE!!
KWALTZ: My instructions were clear.
ARTHUR: We have to go! Let's GO!
ZAPHOD: ( still loopy )
ARTHUR: What? No! Follow those ships!
ZAPHOD: Hey my third arm. I had one, didn't I?
ARTHUR: We have to go after her!
EDDIE: Boys, please! Not so rough. You're damaging my joystick.
FORD: Who is that?
MARVIN: Ghastly, isn't it? I was asked to change the personality type, this was the emergency back-up.
EDDIE: How, if you want me to take you somewhere, we're going to have to start using our magic words, "please" and "thank you."
ARTHUR: Can you change it back?
MARVIN: I can but I won't enjoy it.
EDDIE: I'm wait-ing.
ARTHUR: Don't look at me. I'm too depressed.
FORD: Don't look at me. I'm too depressed.
MARVIN: Don't look at me. I'm too depressed.
ARTHUR: ( getting desperate ) Computer?! Isn't there some kind of manual override switch thing?
EDDIE: WELL WHERE THE HELL IS IT?! Magic words?
ARTHUR: WELL WHERE THE HELL IS IT?! Magic words?
EDDIE: Magic words?
ARTHUR: Show me the override switch or I'll reprogram you with a very large axe.
EDDIE: ( long pause ) I can see this relationship is something we're all going to have to work at.
FORD: I think I should push this button.
ARTHUR: What's that? What happened?!
FORD: A sign lit up saying "Please do not push this button again."
FORD: I know. Dreadful, isn't it?
MARVIN: I know. Dreadful, isn't it?
ARTHUR: Sorry about the landing. Where are we?
ZAPHOD: Wrong. This is the Vogon planet. This is No. It's Magrathea! I know it!
FORD: Wrong. This is the Vogon planet. This is No. It's Magrathea! I know it!
ZAPHOD: No. It's Magrathea! I know it!
FORD: Little something I learned about on an Altairian star cruiser. Captains use them when they really need to concentrate.
ARTHUR: What is it?
FORD: A Thinking Cap.
MARVIN: This will all end in tears, I just know
FORD: I checked the guide for ways to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere. It said "Don't." I'm assuming your plan is better.
ARTHUR: Well, I sort of had this idea we could.
ZAPHOD: See what?
ARTHUR: They all walk along - Arthur at the back, perplexed.
FORD: What was it?
ARTHUR: Nothing. Just my imagination.
FORD: Okay. I think we.
AH!: He leaps back, clutching his cheeks. Arthur spins around.
ARTHUR: You, too?
FORD: Yes. What was that?
ZAPHOD: I think we should keep going.
AAAH!!: What the blazes is that?
ARTHUR: What the blazes is that?
FORD: ( very deliberately ) I have. an idea.
ARTHUR: I can't, help it! Trillian is in there somewhere and we need an idea to save her.
ZAPHOD: I have an idea. ( SMACK! ) Run!
FORD: Ever the politician.
ARTHUR: Okay, so. .not thinking, not thinking, no ideas .this is by no means an idea that has any merit, but Marvin can you give me a
ARTHUR: Alright, where is she?
ARTHUR: Actually, we're looking for. .someone you're detaining, perhaps in some form of incarceration.
VOGON OFFICER: He types into his ancient looking computer.
TRILLIAN: He types into his ancient looking computer.
VOGON OFFICER: Not registered.
TRILLIAN: Try Tricia McMillan.
VOGON OFFICER: Tricia Yggarstuk McMillanus of Blaard?
TRILLIAN: No. Tricia Imogene McMillan of Earth.
VOGON OFFICER: Sorry. No record of "Earth."
TRILLIAN: Earth. In the Milky Way? Um.galactic Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.
VOGON OFFICER: Right. Here it is. "Earth. Destroyed." Do you have a second home planet?
TRILLIAN: Destroyed? No that's impossible.
VOGON OFFICER: Says here it was destroyed to make way for a hyperspace expressway. The order was given.three weeks ago.
TRILLIAN: WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND GIVES AN ORDER TO DESTROY A PLANET!? He said the gray building, right?
ZAPHOD: He said the gray building, right?
ARTHUR: There. That's it. This way.
ARTHUR: Leave this to me. I'm British. I know how to queue.
TRILLIAN: I don't believe you. This is some sort of trick. Zaphod wouldn't blow up a planet, especially mine.
KWALTZ: These are the orders.
TRILLIAN: Love and kisses.?
KWALTZ: Now according to Section 8, sub-section 34 dash A, the punishment for kidnapping is a recitation of the classic poem, "Ode to the Removal of Your Left Kidney." Unless said kidnapping is of the President, in which case you are to be fed to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. We thank you for your cooperation.
ARTHUR: Yes. Hi. We're here about getting a prisoner released?
ARTHUR: Right. Once I've filled it out can I return to the front of the line, seeing as I've already waited.
ARTHUR: Can't you do something?! You're President, aren't you?
ZAPHOD: You want me to make a speech, shake a hand? That's what I do I think. It's all a little fuzzy.
MOMENTS LATER: Arthur is back in line, having waited a long time. He finally gets to the window, hands the green form to the Vogon Processor. She types into her computer, then checks the screen.
ARTHUR: Alright, look. This is the President.
VOGON PROCESSOR: Go to the Prisoner Release Lobby, out the door, right, left, 2nd door on the right.
KWALTZ: You're free to go. Release her.
QUESTULAR: ( yanking blue paper away, He's here?! Zaphod is here!? Let's go get him!
TRILLIAN: You bastard. You signed the order to destroy Earth?!
ARTHUR: He did?
ZAPHOD: I did?
TRILLIAN: "Love and kisses, Zaphod?" I saw the form. You didn't even read it, did you?
ZAPHOD: Honey, I'm President of the Galaxy. I don't get a lot of time for reading.
TRILLIAN: An entire planet, Zaphod. My home. Gone. All because you thought someone wanted your autograph!
ZAPHOD: They framed me! It's routine for controlling Presidents!
KWALTZ: Cancellation of the Rescue of the
ARTHUR: You knew. Why didn't you tell me?
TRILLIAN: You knew. Why didn't you tell me?
ARTHUR: I tried. He threatened me.
TRILLIAN: Get a backbone, Arthur.
ARTHUR: What about coming here to rescue you?! That was my brilliant idea!
KWALTZ: The President tests my patience. This time, I shall pursue him myself. Ready my Yes! This is more like it.
QUESTULAR: Yes! This is more like it.
QUESTULAR: THIS IS INSANITY! My license is expired, Mr. Vice President. I can't fly with an expired license it's against the law.
KWALTZ: My license is expired, Mr. Vice President. I can't fly with an expired license it's against the law.
EDDIE: ( back to his normal voice ) Hi, fellas. Hold on to your hats!
ZAPHOD: Eddie! Welcome back!
FORD: WHAT'S HAPPENING, ZAPHOD?! WHERE DID YOU TELL IT TO GO?! I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!
ZAPHOD: I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!
FORD: ARE YOU SURE WE REATTACHED THIS THING THE RIGHT WAY?!
RIGHT WAY?!: Zaphod is all smiles, hanging on as if he were on a rollercoaster ride.
ZAPHOD: ISN'T IT GREAT?!
EDDIE: Guys, I'm just super happy to tell you we're approaching hyperspace exit Gamma
ZAPHOD: Okay, that's it.I think. Computer? Is that.where are we headed again?
FORD: Hang on, fella, and I'll check.
EDDIE: Hang on, fella, and I'll check.
ARTHUR: Look, you're right. You deserved to know and I should've told you. I don't blame you if you're angry.
ZAPHOD: ( tasting it ) Take us in.
ZAPHOD: The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm.
MARVIN: It's rubbish.
GHOSTLY IMAGE: Greetings. This is a recorded announcement as we're all out the moment. The Commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit, but regrets that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business. If you would like to leave your name and a planet where you can be contacted, kindly do so at the tone.
ARTHUR: Closed? How can a planet be closed?
ZAPHOD: For once, Aldus, I agree with you. Okay, computer. Keep going. Take us down.
EDDIE: Happy to!
GHOSTLY IMAGE: It is most gratifying that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated. As a token of our appreciation, we hope you will enjoy the two thermonuclear missiles we've just sent to converge with your craft. To ensure on-going quality of service, your death may be monitored for training purposes. Thank you.
EDDIE: Guys, I'm delighted to tell you there are two thermonuclear missiles headed right for us. Should I take evasive action?
FORD: Um.yes, computer. Evade!
EDDIE: There seems to be something jamming my guidance systems. Impact minus 45 seconds. Call me Eddie if it'll help you The H.O.G. streaks forward. The missiles are gaining.
ARTHUR: Computer! DO SOMETHING!!
EDDIE: Sure thing, fellah. Handing over manual control. Good luck!
ZAPHOD: I can't do this without my other arm!
ZAPHOD: Did we lose them?
FORD: No. They're right behind us.
ARTHUR: Look, why don't I just hit this thing?
ZAPHOD: NO! We're here! No telling where it will send us!
ZAPHOD: Too late. ARTHUR HITS THE BUTTON. WOOMF! Light blasts through the bridge. Morphing Empty for a moment. Then, the HEART OF GOLD reforms. A few beats later, a SPERM WHALE floats into frame followed by a BOWL OF PETUNIAS.
NO!: Too late. ARTHUR HITS THE BUTTON. WOOMF! Light blasts through the bridge. Morphing Empty for a moment. Then, the HEART OF GOLD reforms. A few beats later, a SPERM WHALE floats into frame followed by a BOWL OF PETUNIAS.
ZAPHOD: Um.where are we?
TRILLIAN: Exactly where we were, I think.
ZAPHOD: And the missiles?
FORD: Have apparently turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking
EDDIE: At an improbability factor of eight million, seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight to one against.
ARTHUR: I could really use a cup of tea.
GUIDE VOICE: It is important to note that suddenly, and against all probability, a sperm whale had been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet. And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with suddenly not being a whale any more. This is what it thought as it fell.
GUIDE VOICE: Curiously, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was "Oh no, not again."
ARTHUR: You mean the hippies were right?
ZAPHOD: Okay. In we go.
ARTHUR: What?! Are you out of what's left of your mind? We can't step into that.that.
FORD: We gotta pick one, right? If it's not the right one, we come back and pick another. No biggie.
ARTHUR: Yes big biggie. What if that's the last door we ever step through? What if it rips us into tiny little atomic
ZAPHOD: It's the right one. I have a hunch.
ARTHUR: He's got good hunches. I say we go.
FORD: He's got good hunches. I say we go.
ARTHUR: Go with the hunch of a narcissist with half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous thinking cap!? Are you insane?!
ZAPHOD: Hey, I think I resent that.
ARTHUR: I don't care what you think you think.
TRILLIAN: And she takes off running for the door. Suicide? Bravery? They turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex. She YELPS as her body is bent in half, twisted like a rung mop, then sucked inside. Arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air. Ford is semi-impressed. Zaphod, unfazed.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!: And she takes off running for the door. Suicide? Bravery? They turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex. She YELPS as her body is bent in half, twisted like a rung mop, then sucked inside. Arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air. Ford is semi-impressed. Zaphod, unfazed.
ZAPHOD: That's supposed to happen.I think.
ARTHUR: No. No! NOOO!!!
MARVIN: I told you this would all end in tears.
ARTHUR: Life is full of paradoxes, isn't it?
MARVIN: Don't talk to me about life.
ARTHUR: Here I am, God knows how far from home.
MARVIN: Don't talk to me about God.
ARTHUR: .and this is where I see the most spectacular sunset I've ever laid eyes on. We only had the one sun at home. Planet called Earth.
MARVIN: I know. You keep going on about it. It sounds awful.
ARTHUR: Oh no, it's beautiful. Or at least, it Did it have oceans?
MARVIN: Did it have oceans?
ARTHUR: Yes. Great wide rolling blue oceans.
MARVIN: Can't bear oceans.
ARTHUR: So this is how it will all end, then? Me, on a dead planet with a manically depressed robot.
MARVIN: You think you've got problems? What are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don't bother to answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don't know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level.
ARTHUR: He jumps, crab walks backwards away from the man.
SLARTIBARTFAST: My name is not important.
ARTHUR: Late? What for?
SLARTIBARTFAST: What is your name, Earthman?
ARTHUR: Dent. Arthur Dent.
SLARTIBARTFAST: Late as in "the late Dentarthurdent." It's a sort of threat you see. Never been much good at them myself, but I'm told they can be terribly effective.
ARTHUR: Trust a man who won't tell me his name?
SLARTIBARTFAST: My name? Very well. My name is.Slartibartfast.
MARVIN: I could calculate your chances of survival but you won't like it.
SLARTIBARTFAST: I must warn you. We are about to pass through, well, a sort of gateway thing. It may disturb you. It scares the willies out of me.
ARTHUR: He is bent, twisted and sucked away. Slarti follows. Marvin stands for a moment, then looks up to. 92a THE SKY 92a where the fleet of Vogon ships has now arrived.
MARVIN: Funny how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse, it suddenly does.
GHOSTLY IMAGE: This is a recorded announcement as we're all out at the moment. The Commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for.
KWALTZ: Turn that off.
SLARTIBARTFAST: I told you you might find it a bit I have found this whole day a bit
ARTHUR: I have found this whole day a bit
SLARTIBARTFAST: Did you know we built planets?
ARTHUR: .and men.
SLARTIBARTFAST: Mmmm? What?
ARTHUR: The best laid plans of mice and men.
SLARTIBARTFAST: I don't think men have got much to do with
ZAPHOD: This is it!
DEEP THOUGHT: Shhh. This is a good bit.
ZAPHOD: Oh great Deep Thought.we have traveled long.and far. Have you calculated. the Ultimate Question? Of Life, the Universe and I've been watching TV.
DEEP THOUGHT: DEEP THOUGHT I've been watching TV.
ZAPHQD: DEEP THOUGHT I've been watching TV.
DEEP THOUGHT: I've been watching TV.
ZAPHOD: Zaphod holds a smile but his world is slowly crumbling.
DEEP THOUGHT: I designed another computer to perform that great task.
ZAPHOD: Oh, right.I forgot. Is it here?
DEEP THOUGHT: Not here. Another world.
ZAPHOD: It's on another world?
DEEP THOUGHT: It is another world. Or was.
ZAPHOD: DEEP THOUGHT Ask your companion.
DEEP THOUGHT: Ask your companion.
ZAPHOD: 0kay you're sure you don't have the Or a way to you, you know access it or something. I think I've done like a lot to get here.
DEEP THOUGHT: Zaphod looks up. Deep Thought is shushing him?
ZAPHOD: Great. This is just great. Let's go find something else for my entire life to be
FORD: Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us for? We have to get it. You gave the guy your head.
ZAPHOD: I know. Why did I do that?
FORD: Um.Deep Thought? We we're told you have a g.
ZAPHOD: Thank you. Great! This is a bust, too!
FORD: Hey, man, you must be really frustrated. To go through all you did only to come here and get no answer, which means no fame and money, and you deserve that, man. Because you're great you're just really, really great.
TRILLIAN: Give me that thing.
SLARTIBARTFAST: The galaxy was a bit of a shambles, you see. Everyone enjoying themselves being singers and comedians and really creative and interesting things like that. No one doing the boring jobs.
ARTHUR: Oh, you had that problem, too?
SLARTIBARTFAST: In spades. So a species was genetically engineered to do the boring jobs. Tax inspectors, traffic wardens, government officials. We were commissioned to build a special planet for them. Problem was, some cleverdick made it so any time one of the creatures had an interesting idea it would get a hefty smack around the face.
ARTHUR: What? You did that? I've been there!
SLARTIBARTFAST: Then I gather you've met some of the The Vogons?
ARTHUR: The Vogons?
SLARTIBARTFAST: ( shuddering ) Relentless blighters.
ZAPHOD: .and you're right, I shouldn't be so upset 'cause life goes on and I should just go on with it, right?
TRILLIAN: Shoot him again.
ZAPHOD: Hitchhiking is good. Towels are good, Yeah. I kinda like this. She take the gun from him.
TRILLIAN: Yeah. I kinda like this. She take the gun from him.
FORD: Yeah. I kinda like this. She take the gun from him.
TRILLIAN: A gun that makes people suddenly see things from your point of view. Useful tool for the deranged evangelist trying to convert the masses, eh? She starts walking.
ZAPHOD: Who cares?
TRILLIAN: ( spinning on him; pointed ) I do especially since we're both somewhat of an endangered species now.
ZAPHOD: Why so edgy?
CLICK!: ZAPHOD ( CONT'D ) Of course you're edgy, your planet's been blown up and you've been tooling around the Galaxy with the guy who signed the
TRILLIAN: Won't affect me. I'm already a woman.
ZAPHOD: Uh oh oh. It's okay, it's only a couple of.
SLARTIBARTFAST: Here we are, then. Look familiar?
ARTHUR: So it wasn't destroyed?
SLARTIBARTFAST: Actually, it was. This is a back-up. Earth Mark II.
ARTHUR: So you're saying you . made the Earth?
SLARTIBARTFAST: Well, not me alone. It was a group effort. I did my part, though. Ever heard of a place, I think it's called Norway?
ARTHUR: Mice? Who cares about bloody mice?
SLARTIBARTFAST: Are you a fan of plate tectonics?
ARTHUR: They brought.I'm sorry, when you say "mice" do you mean the little white furry creatures with the cheese fixation?
SLARTIBARTFAST: These creatures you call "mice" are merely the protrusion into our dimension of hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese must've been a front. They were experimenting on you, you see. A vast computer program.
ARTHUR: Ah. I see where you're confused. You see we were experimenting on them.
SLARTIBARTFAST: Oh, I gather they arranged for you to conduct some primitively staged experiments so they could prod your thinking here and there. But you were actually elements in the computer program. They really are very clever hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings. Ah. They've nearly finished the oceans.
ARTHUR: So you're trying to tell me that mice designed and built Deep Thought.and Deep Thought designed the Earth.which was a giant supercomputer.that you built.to calculate the Ultimate Question. Only, Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the program was completed?
SLARTIBARTFAST: That's bureaucracy for you.
ARTHUR: Actually, this explains a lot. All my life I've had this strange feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, something sinister .
SLARTIBARTFAST: That's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the universe has that.
SLARTIBARTFAST: I don't know, perhaps I'm old and tired, but I always think that the chances of finding out what's really going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is say hang the sense of it and keep yourself busy. I'd much rather be happy than right any day.
ARTHUR: And are you?
SLARTIBARTFAST: No. That's where it all falls down of Here we are, then.
ARTHUR: Is this.?
ARTHUR: What what are you doing? What happened to you?
FORD: Funniest thing. ( chew, chew ) Our hosts attacked us with Dismodulating Anti Phase Stun Mist ( chew, chew ) then brought us to this amazing meal as a way to make it up to us ( chew, chew ). Try the mutton. It's
ZAPHOD: ( mouth full ) Zarking incredible. Hosts attack you ? And then you sit down for is that tea?
ARTHUR: Hosts attack you ? And then you sit down for is that tea?
BENJY MOUSE: After ten million years on Earth, and a rather large chunk of that time in England, it would be utterly humiliating if we didn't know how to make a decent pot of tea.
TRILLIAN: Arthur, these are our hosts. Benjy mouse and Franky mouse ( chew, chew ). They control a large sector of the Universe in our dimension ( chew, chew ). I'm sorry, I thought you were told about the mice.
ARTHUR: Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn't quite prepared for the full reality of it.
BENJY MOUSE: Sit, Earthman. Eat.
ARTHUR: In a moment, perhaps. I can't seem to let go of this table.
SLARTIBARTFAST: Pardon the interruption, but I'll just be getting back to work now.
BENJY MOUSE: That won't be necessary, Slartibartfast.
ZAPHOD: ( cracking up, like he's stoned ) Smarty fart blast?
ZAPHOD: BENJY MOUSE It looks like we won't be needing the new Earth after all, now that we've found the only living native of the planet.
BENJY MOUSE: It looks like we won't be needing the new Earth after all, now that we've found the only living native of the planet.
SLARTIBARTFAST: But.they've nearly finished the oceans.
FRAHKY MOUSE: That will be all, Slartibartfast.
ARTHUR: I'm sorry, when you say "the only living native" do you mean me? What about
BENJY MOUSE: We performed some rudimentary DNA tests on the ship. She's half-native. Her real father was a Blahardid, the hyper- intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race native to the planet Olbed, who apparently popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with a one Ms. Francis McMillan.
TRILLIAN: ( looking up, mouth full ) Which explains a lot.
ARTHUR: So mostly harmless and me. That's it.
BENJY MOUSE: We're sorry to have stage managed you so shamelessly, but once we learned you were the only full-blooded Earthling in the universe, it was important that we get you here by any means necessary.
FRANKY MOUSE: We've spent a considerable amount of time on your planet trying to find this wretched Ultimate Question, and the thought of doing it all over again on account of those idiotic Vogons sickens me to no end. Which is why you're here.
BENJY MOUSE: Sit, Earthling. Sit.
NOT THERE!: Arthur jumps. The others look up. Benjy and Franky cover their outburst with a smile.
BENJY MOUSE: This chair is much more comfortable.
ARTHUR: Mmmm. This really is delicious.
BENJY MOUSE: Good. Glad you like it. Now to
ZAPHOD: Sorry. Thought you were proposing a
EAT!: Ford and Zaphod eat. Benjy turns to Arthur. Smiles. No one notices, through the window, a row of Vogons cresting the hill.
BENJY MOUSE: About this Ultimate Question. You see, we've been offered a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D TV chat show and lecture circuit, and quite frankly, we're very much inclined to take it.
FRANKY MOUSE: But - and here's the point - we have to have product. Which means we still need an ultimate question.
BENJY MOUSE: Or at least, one that sounds ultimate.
FRANKY HOUSE: Yes. Got to sound good.
ARTHUR: An Ultimate Question that sounds good. From a couple of mice.for a chat show.
FRANKY MOUSE: And as it turns out, the chances are astronomically high that the structure of the question is encoded in your brain. Which is why we need it. More tea?
ARTHUR: I'm sorry did you just say you need my Yes. To extract the question.
BENJY MOUSE: Yes. To extract the question.
ARTHUR: You can't have my brain. I'm using it.
FRANKY MOUSE: BENJY MOUSE We can replace it if you think it's important. An electronic brain maybe.
BENJY MOUSE: We can replace it if you think it's important. An electronic brain maybe.
FRANKY MOUSE: A simple one should suffice. Who would know the difference?
ARTHUR: I would!
FRANKY MOUSE: No, you wouldn't. We could program you not
ARTHUR: Ford! Zaphod! TRILLIAN!!
BENJY MOUSE: Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.
ARTHUR: Wait a minute, JUST WAIT A SODDING
MINUTE!!: The scythes and arms stop spinning. Arthur stumbles backwards and sits down in the chair. The others stop eating and listen.
BENJY MOUSE: Hey, that's not bad. Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where that came from because my head is filled, with questions, and I can assure you mate, no answer to any of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes. Indecision? Loads. But happiness.?
ARTHUR: Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where that came from because my head is filled, with questions, and I can assure you mate, no answer to any of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes. Indecision? Loads. But happiness.?
BENJY MOUSE: We don't want to be happy. We want to be Take his brain.
FRANKY MOUSE: Take his brain.
BENJY MOUSE: Shoot him!!
FRANKY MOUSE: Oh, shit.

KWALTZ: Mr. President! We are here for your
ZAPHOD: Thank you!
FORD: Okay that thing I said about not saving my life because we're even? Scratch that. Save at will.
TRILLIAN: We need that gun.
ZAPHOD: ( campaign sound-byte ) We need tighter gun control!
FORD: We need his other head. Okay I'll create a distraction.
ARTHUR: ( sarcastic ) Brilliant plan. I'm certain it will work.
FORD: ( squinting at Arthur ) You know I think sometimes you say things that mean something other than what you're actually saying.
AHHHHHHHH!!!!: The Vogons are so caught off guard, they back away.
TRILLIAN: 108 She and Arthur both run out toward the gun. 108
QUESTULAR: It's a towel! It's only a TOWEL!! GET
HIM!!: The Police stop their retreat, raise their guns, move forward. Ford skids to a stop and runs back toward Arthur and Trillian, both clinging to the gun, running back toward the truck. GUNFIRE ERUPTS. A and T TRIP. The POV gun goes flying and lands in. MARVIN'S ARMS.
FORD: He looks to the skies just as Ford fans out his towel and uses it to bring Z, A & T to the ground just as.
ZAPHOD: He looks to the skies just as Ford fans out his towel and uses it to bring Z, A & T to the ground just as.
QUESTULAR: Shoot me. Please Zaphod. Shoot me.
ZAPHOD: Marvin. You saved our lives.
MARVIN: I know. Wretched, isn't it?
QUESTULAR: ( distant ) Oh man! I love being me!!
ARTHUR: Thank you.
SLARTIBARTFAST: I've just been informed by some of the lads that since we're so near completion, we're going to go ahead and finish Earth. We can put it back exactly the way it was when you left, you know unless there's anything you'd like to change. Something you think your planet could do without?
ARTHUR: Yes. Me.
TRILLIAN: Let's go somewhere.
ARTHUR: Yes, You name it. I'll go.
ZAPHOD: I'm going to Humma's. He has my head.I think. Doesn't he? I'm so confused.
FORD: And I'm hungry. After we get your head let's grab a bite. I know this great restaurant at the end of the universe.
SLARTIBARTFAST: Okay. Hold tight.
