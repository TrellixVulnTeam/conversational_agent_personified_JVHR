DRAGON RACING!: It's like an aerial version of the Monte Carlo race. Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff faces and perched over the sea. FISHLEGS, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, MEATLUG, who carries the sheep in her claws, until. SNOTLOUT, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his Monstrous Nightmare, HOOKFANG, steal the sheep from them.
SNOTLOUT: Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you want that?
FISHLEGS: Snotlout! That's mine! Snotlout FALLS BACK toward RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT, who lag on their two-headed Zippleback, BARF & BELCH.
SNOTLOUT: Here ya go, babe. With a chivalrous grin, Snotlout tosses the sheep to Ruffnut. She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE.
RUFFNUT: Come on, Barf. It's starting to stink around here. Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. Tuffnut mocks Snotlout with a mugging grin.
TUFFNUT: Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow this place, Belch! Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke. As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep. Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd.
STOICK: That's nine for the Twins, Astrid lags with three, Fishlegs and Snotlout trail with NONE! Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard painted with an image of Toothless.
GOBBER: Scared him off with the big talk, didn't ya, Stoick? WHACK! Snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets CLIPPED from behind. ASTRID, rolls in, astride STORMFLY spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite What are you doing, Snotlout?! They're going to win now!
ASTRID: What are you doing, Snotlout?! They're going to win now!
SNOTLOUT: She's my princess! Whatever she wants, she gets.
ASTRID: Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury you alive?!
SNOTLOUT: Only for a few hours! BACK TO THE RACERS, as they peel away, pouring on the speed.
STOICK: It's time, Gobber.
GOBBER: ( aloud, to the crowd ) Last lap! A HORN sounds. The racers all turn to each other, excited.
ASTRID: The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly! We can still win this thing!
RUFFNUT: Come on, Barf!
TUFFNUT: Let's go!
FISHLEGS: Go, Meatlug! GOBBER loads the BLACK SHEEP onto a catapult.
GOBBER: This is your big moment. Have a nice flight! He pulls the trigger, LAUNCHING the black sheep into the air. Astrid spots it and steers Stormfly into a steep climb toward Up, up, up! In a flash, Fishlegs and Meatlug blur past, NABBING the Good job, Meatlug! Fishlegs tosses his captured prize to Ruffnut.
ASTRID: Up, up, up! In a flash, Fishlegs and Meatlug blur past, NABBING the Good job, Meatlug! Fishlegs tosses his captured prize to Ruffnut.
FISHLEGS: Good job, Meatlug! Fishlegs tosses his captured prize to Ruffnut.
RUFFNUT: Yeah! The Black Sheep! Snotlout sighs, frustrated.
ASTRID: You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!
RUFFNUT: I'm totally winning! Fishlegs hovers up nest to Ruffnut with a starry-eyed smile.
FISHLEGS: We're winning together! She RAMS BARF into Meatlug, sending Fishlegs into an uncontrolled SPIN. He SLAMS into Snotlout, sending their dragons TUMBLING head over tail. The crowd goes wild.
RUFFNUT: No one can stop me now!
TUFFNUT: Except for me. We're attached, He GRABS at the sheep. Ruffnut fights back, inciting a tug-of- Quit trying to steal all my glory! And while they're distracted, Astrid steers Stormfly toward them, CLOSING IN.
STOICK: Get `em, Astrid!
TUFFNUT RUFFNUT: It's MY glory! No sheep, no You're always ruining glory! EVERYTHING! Astrid leaps off of Stormfly, runs up Belch's spindly neck, and PLUCKS the black sheep from the Twins' hands.
ASTRID: She tumbles through the air onto Stormfly, sticking a perfect landing, black sheep in hand.
RUFFNUT: HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 6. BACK TO STOICK, beside himself. The crowd ROARS.
STOICK: Well played! Hahaha! ( gloating, to the crowd ) That's my future daughter-in-law!
SNOTLOUT: Uh, excuse me.
ASTRID: Snotlout HURLS his hammer. Astrid ducks and rolls Stormfly out of the way. The hammer catches Fishlegs in the face with a CLANG. The crowd collectively winces. Astrid and Stormfly recover from their roll, loop over the water, and they BLAST past the finish line, DUNKING the black sheep into their basket!
STOICK: That's thirteen! Astrid takes the The crowd COMES UNHINGED. Astrid flies over the crowd, basking in her victory.
HICCUP: They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks as they soar in formation. Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight suit an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather.
HICCUP: `Afternoon m'lady. Where have you Astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as Toothless rushes up to greet them.
ASTRID: Winning races. What else? The real question is. where have YOU been?
HICCUP: Avoiding my dad.
ASTRID: Oh, no. What happened now? Astrid sits beside Hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to the map. Behind them, Toothless greets Stormfly, inciting a play fight.
HICCUP: Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake up. The sun's shining. Terrible Terrors are singing on the rooftop. I saunter down to breakfast, thinking all is right with the world, and I get. He gets to his feet and puffs out his chest.
ASTRID: ( APING HICCUP )
HICCUP: Okay, first of all, I don't sound like that. What is this character? And second. what is that thing you're doing with my shoulders? Astrid laughs, jostling her shoulders in an awkward way. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 12.
ASTRID: ( continuing her impression
HICCUP: WHEN have I ever done that with my You just did. She laughs, playfully.
ASTRID: You just did. She laughs, playfully.
HICCUP: Okay. just. ( holding her arms, mock-
STERN ): Hold still. It's very serious. She giggles, trying to hold a straight face.
ASTRID: TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods! She jumps to her feet, beaming.
HICCUP: You're gonna wear out the spring coil. The calibration is very HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 13. They're suddenly BOWLED OVER by Toothless and Stormfly.
ASTRID: ( EXCITED )
HICCUP: I didn't. By the time he turned around, I was gone. Astrid picks up the map, folding it as she paces around him, processing it all.
ASTRID: Well, it's a lot of responsibility. The map will have to wait for sure, and I'll need to fly Toothless, since you'll be too busy. She pauses, wincing in sympathy. She turns to Hiccup. He nods knowingly, taking the map from her.
HICCUP: It's not me, Astrid. All those speeches, and planning, and running the village. that's his thing.
ASTRID: I think you're missing the point. I mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be pretty excited. Hiccup shakes his head.
HICCUP: I'm not like you. You know exactly who you are. You always have. He shuffles to the cliff's edge, gazing out at the new land.
ASTRID: What you're searching for. isn't out there, Hiccup. She places a hand on his chest.
HICCUP: Maybe. But, y'know. there is something out there.
ASTRID: ( EXASPERATED )
HICCUP: Stay close. They fly through the suspended remains of the buildings, splintered, and frozen in mid-destruction.
ASTRID: ERET ( O.S. ) The men fire a stern-mounted cannon. The projectile unfurls into a NET. Hiccup and Toothless dart out of its way.
HICCUP: Astrid! Look out! It HITS Stormfly, TANGLING her wings and causing her to spin uncontrolled. Astrid struggles to free her as they HURTLE toward a collision.
ASTRID: Astrid falls off of Stormfly, but Toothless SNATCHES her at the last second. Stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. Trappers rush out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. She whips her tail, sending spikes flying.
HICCUP!: Astrid falls off of Stormfly, but Toothless SNATCHES her at the last second. Stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. Trappers rush out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. She whips her tail, sending spikes flying.
ERET: Watch the tail! A large, raven-haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes and lands upon Stormfly's head, twisting it and taking her down like a rodeo cowboy.
HICCUP: ( to the trappers ) What are you doing? Astrid and Hiccup leap off of Toothless, rushing toward Eret's men immediately draw weapons. Hiccup extends and ignites his DRAGON BLADE a telescoping fiery sword impressive enough to wow Eret's men.
STOP!: ( to the trappers ) What are you doing? Astrid and Hiccup leap off of Toothless, rushing toward Eret's men immediately draw weapons. Hiccup extends and ignites his DRAGON BLADE a telescoping fiery sword impressive enough to wow Eret's men.

STORMFLY!: ( to the trappers ) What are you doing? Astrid and Hiccup leap off of Toothless, rushing toward Eret's men immediately draw weapons. Hiccup extends and ignites his DRAGON BLADE a telescoping fiery sword impressive enough to wow Eret's men.
ERET: Back again? Eret steps forward, focused only on Toothless.
ASTRID: Dragon army?
HICCUP: Look, we don't want any trouble.
ERET: Ha! You should've thought of that before you stole all of our dragons and blasted our fort to bits!
HICCUP: What are you talking about? Astrid and Hiccup take in the icy destruction, putting it HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 17.
ASTRID: What are you talking about? Astrid and Hiccup take in the icy destruction, putting it HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 17.
HICCUP: You think we did this?
ERET: Dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is, without do-gooder dragon riders sneaking in to rescue them.
HICCUP: What do-gooder there are other dragon riders?
ERET: You mean, other than your thieving friend from last night? You tell Eret approaches. Toothless snarls, protectively.
HICCUP: Drago what-fist? Does anything you say make sense?
TEENY: He's expecting a new shipment of dragons for his army by tomorrow.
ERET: This is what he gave me last time I showed up empty-handed. He promised to be far less understanding in the Look, we don't know anything about a dragon thief, or an ice-spitting dragon, or your lunatic boss and his dragon army, okay?
HICCUP: ( EXASPERATED )
ERET: Oh, where are my manners? I'm Eret. Son of Eret. Finest dragon trapper He pulls a dagger from behind his back, waving it cockily. His men ready their weapons and net cannons.
HICCUP: And this is Toothless. He says we're going. Now.
ERET: Heh. They all say that.
ASTRID: Stormfly! C'mon, go! Go! Eret gets to his feet in time to see Toothless and Stormfly take to the air, carrying Hiccup and Astrid out of reach of the volley of arrows.
ERET: YOU WILL NEVER HOLD ON TO THOSE DRAGONS, YOU HEAR ME?! DRAGO IS COMING FOR THEM ALL! I/E. BERK/BLACKSMITH STALL - SUNSET ( Sequence 0500 - Lock-Down! ) HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 19. The GANG joyrides past GOTHI'S house, scattering her assortment of terrible terrors. She waves a fist at them as they sweep past, WHOOPING AND CHORTLING, leading us down THE UPPER PLAZA, where a GATHERED CROWD of Vikings and their dragons are cued up outside of Gobber's BLACKSMITH STALL, awaiting their turns. Stoick maneuvers through the crowd, spouting JOVIAL GREETINGS in passing. He makes a bee-line for GOBBER, who is busily grinding a metal dragon tooth into shape. A Zippleback waits patiently, his head cocked open like a car hood while the other head watches, sympathetically.
STOICK: Any sign of him? Gobber flips up his welding guard, revealing a matching area of unsoiled skin.
GOBBER: Ah, he's probably flown off the edge of the world by now. You sure you want that kid running the village? You can still delay your Oh, he's ready. You'll see. A SUDDEN EXCITEMENT in the crowd heralds Hiccup and Astrid's return. They touch down on Toothless and Stormfly.
STOICK: Oh, he's ready. You'll see. A SUDDEN EXCITEMENT in the crowd heralds Hiccup and Astrid's return. They touch down on Toothless and Stormfly.
POINT ): Huh? The pride of Berk! Hiccup stows his helmet and heads toward Stoick with urgency.
GOBBER: Who finally decided to show up for work. Yay.
HICCUP: Sorry. Got held up. ( privately, to Stoick ) Hey, Dad, could I have a word?
STOICK: Something you're itching to tell HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 20.
HICCUP: Not quite the itch you're thinking of, but yes. Stoick hands him an apron and guides him to the front desk.
STOICK: Good man! Now, lesson one. A chief's first duty is to his people. So. Stoick changes the rune on the "being served" placard.
HICCUP: Could we just talk in private for
STARKARD: That's me! That's me! I'm next! ( pushing his way through ) I was ahead of you! Excuse me, I've been here all day! STARKARD reaches the counter, giddy with excitement.
STOICK: Absolutely! You got it, sir! Stoick spins Hiccup around, steering him back into the shop.
HICCUP: Dad, this is actually a little more important than building saddles.
STOICK: Ah-ah! Lesson two. No task is too small when it comes to serving your people. Excuse us, Grump. They step over the tail of a large, snoring oaf of a dragon, stirring him awake with a fussy start.
GOBBER: Grump! You let the forge die down HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 21. Grump coughs a slug of molten lava into the forge. It splatters everywhere, igniting a rash of fires. Hiccup side- steps them as he gathers materials in the back of the stall. Gobber pulls the fire extinguisher, dumping water everywhere.
STOICK: One of these. And this.
HICCUP: There you go! Go on. Have away.
DAD: There you go! Go on. Have away.
STOICK: There you go! Go on. Have away.
HICCUP: But, seriously, I really need to tell you about this new land we came across.
GOBBER: Another one?! Fishlegs walks in, followed by the Twins and Snotlout.
FISHLEGS: Any new dragons? Stoick slaps a sheet of leather onto a dragon mold, and hands Hiccup pencil. Exasperated, Hiccup begins tracing an outline as he speaks.
HICCUP: We didn't stick around to find out. These folks weren't particularly Oh, really? Your Night Fury and Deadly Nadder didn't bring them cheering to the rooftops? Gobber spins his prosthetic arm dispenser.
GOBBER: Oh, really? Your Night Fury and Deadly Nadder didn't bring them cheering to the rooftops? Gobber spins his prosthetic arm dispenser.
HICCUP: No, this was different. Not the standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha I've come to enjoy. These guys were trappers. Dragon trappers. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 22.
ASTRID: You should've seen their fort. All blown apart and stuck in giant spikes of ice. It was weird.
HICCUP: I've never seen anything like it. And worst of all, they thought we did it! Gobber pops off his prosthetic tongs and selects a wire brush from his dispenser.
GOBBER: Y'know, you two are gonna get yourselves in SERIOUS trouble one of these days. Not everyone appreciates this way of life. Which he uses to brush his mustache and eyebrows. Stoick takes the sheet of leather to the table saw.
STOICK: Gobber's right, son. Best we keep to our own. Besides, you'll have more important uses for your time And pulls a lever, starting it up.
BREATH ): Once we make the big announcement! Hiccup pulls the lever, shutting the saw down.
HICCUP: They are building a dragon army. Silence fills the stall. Vikings exchange worried glances.
TUFFNUT: I'll bloody his fist with my face if he tries to take my dragon!
RUFFNUT: Or mine. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 23.
TUFFNUT: You're such a moron.
FISHLEGS: A beautiful moron.
SNOTLOUT: Ruffnut grumbles, revolted by their advances. Stoick grabs Hiccup by the shoulders, wide-eyed and intense.
STOICK: Bludvist? Drago Bludvist?
HICCUP: Uh, yeah. Wait. You know him?
STOICK: GROUND ALL DRAGONS! What? Why?! Hiccup, Astrid, Gobber, and Toothless chase after Stoick.
HICCUP: What? Why?! Hiccup, Astrid, Gobber, and Toothless chase after Stoick.
STOICK: SEAL THE GATES! LOWER THE STORM Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is You heard the man! Lock it down! Behind him, the massive storm doors rattle as they're No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off this island until I give the word! HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 24.

STOICK: No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off this island until I give the word! HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 24.
HICCUP: Because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway Stoick turns to Hiccup, gravely serious.
STOICK: Because Drago Bludvist is a madman. Without conscience or mercy. And if he's built a dragon army. gods help us all. Stoick continues on shouting orders, leaving Hiccup stewing.
HICCUP: Then let's ride back out there. We'll follow those trappers to Drago and talk some sense into him.
STOICK: No. We fortify the island.
HICCUP: It's our duty to keep the peace!
STOICK: Peace is over, Hiccup. I must prepare you for war.
HICCUP: War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our dragons, we can't wait around for him to get here. Let's go find him and change his mind.
STOICK: Some minds won't be changed, Hiccup. Berk is what you need to worry about.
STALL!: HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 25. . leaving Hiccup eyeing Toothless as the storm doors close. Astrid approaches him, seeing the determination on his face.
ASTRID: Hiccup, don't.
HICCUP: I have to. He gives her a quick peck on the cheek.
STOICK: THIS WAY! QUICKLY! Hiccup and Toothless BLAST PAST, heading for the exit.
HICCUP!: They try to fly through one door, but it seals shut.
HICCUP: Come on! Toothless spins around and DIVES through the gap in the second lowering storm door.
STOICK: Astrid and Stormfly blow past Stoick and slip through the storm door before it shuts, leaving Stoick fuming.
ERET: Keep your eyes peeled, lads! With this wind, we'll reach Drago by daybreak, so best we fill this ship up with dragons and quick! It's no time to be picky. Not if we want to keep our HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 26.
UG: Uh. Eret? Eret turns in the direction Ug is pointing to see a pair of dragons flapping toward them.
ERET: HEADS! OFF THE PORT QUARTER! The crewmen swing the net cannons toward the back-lit, silhouetted dragons, drawing ever closer.
HICCUP: Nope. It's your lucky day. We give Eret's crew exchange confused stares. As does Astrid.
ASTRID: What are you doing? Toothless tries to follow them, but Hiccup holds him back.
HICCUP: Toothless, stay. Hiccup flips the latch, lowering the grate as Eret watches, The dragons don't really care for cramped spaces, so they'll just hang out with you. They won't be any trouble. Eret's men nervously direct their swords and spears toward Toothless. HE SNARLS.
HICCUP: Oops. Almost forgot. Can't have armed prisoners!
ASTRID: How is this a plan? He retracts the blade and offers it up. A crewman cautiously takes it, looking it over. The pommel of the hilt is expelling green gas.
HICCUP: Just what every dragon trapper needs. One end coats the blade in Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas. All it takes is a spark and. A curious crewman clicks the lighter, igniting the gas. Hiccup ducks as the sudden explosion sweeps over the deck. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 28.
ERET: Give me that! Eret snatches the dragon blade and HURLS it overboard. Stormfly bolts after it.
HICCUP: No game. We just want to meet And returns in a flash, dropping it at Eret's feet like a fetching dog, tongue wagging. Eret throws it again, frustrated. Stormfly returns with it just as quickly.
ERET: Because I'm going to change his mind about dragons. Eret and his crew LAUGH. Astrid pokes out of the well.
HICCUP: Because I'm going to change his mind about dragons. Eret and his crew LAUGH. Astrid pokes out of the well.
ASTRID: He can be really persuasive. Hiccup pets Toothless, thoughtfully.
HICCUP: Once you've earned his loyalty, there is nothing a dragon won't do for you.
ERET: Puh! You won't be changing any minds around here. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 29.
HICCUP: I can change yours. Right here. Right now. Hiccup sets Toothless' tail in the locked, splayed position. Eret sneers, suspicious.
ERET: Dragon riders! Toothless SHRIEKS and bounds up the mast, spotting Hiccup in the talons of a Monstrous Nightmare. Toothless relaxes, realizing that it's Hookfang.
HICCUP: Put me down! Snotlout! What are you Snotlout looks back to see if Ruffnut witnessed the save.
SNOTLOUT: See how well I protect and provide? Ruffnut GRUMBLES at the incessant courting. A FLYING NET whizzes past her head.
TUFFNUT: Aggh! What is with all the nets?!
RUFFNUT: Hey watch it! That was close. Ruffnut spots Eret, FIRING nets from the deck of the ship.
ASTRID: HOLD YOUR FIRE! Hiccup glides unsteadily towards the ship and collides with its sail. He slides down the canvas and drops to the deck. Toothless lands behind him.
HICCUP: WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?! Gobber and Grump land on the deck, scattering Eret's crew.
GOBBER: We're here to RESCUE you!
HICCUP: I DON'T NEED to be rescued!
ENOUGH!: The bow dips heavily as Stoick touches down on SKULLCRUSHER. He dismounts, fuming. Eret blocks Stoick, cocky and confident.
ERET: Well, didn't you just pick the wrong ship, eh? I am Eret, son of Stoick shoves his face aside, sending Eret SLAMMING into Grump. Before he can react, Gobber CLUBS Eret on the head, sending him collapsing to the deck. Grump then sits on him, smothering him into submission. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 31.
GOBBER: Anyone else? Eret's men eye the Vikings, armed and flanked by their dragons. They set down their swords.
STOICK: ( TO HICCUP )
HICCUP: Of all the irresponsible
STOICK: Of all the irresponsible
HICCUP: I'm trying to protect our dragons and stop a war! How is that BECAUSE WAR IS WHAT HE WANTS, SON! Hiccup glares, frustrated. Stoick SIGHS, realizing that he has to explain.
STOICK: BECAUSE WAR IS WHAT HE WANTS, SON! Hiccup glares, frustrated. Stoick SIGHS, realizing that he has to explain.
FLASHBACK: A hulking, cloaked figure strides confidently into fire-lit hall, interrupting a council meeting of Viking chieftains. His face is masked in silhouette.
RUFFNUT: Good one.
TUFFNUT: Good one.
STOICK: Aye. We laughed, too.
STOICK: ( STINGING REGRET )
HICCUP: Hiccup turns and stomps toward Toothless, determined. Eret watches intently.
STOICK: I'm still going to try. Hiccup jumps onto Toothless and locks eyes with Stoick.
HICCUP: I'm still going to try. Hiccup jumps onto Toothless and locks eyes with Stoick.
ASTRID: Let's go.
STOICK: NO! Lead the others back to Berk. I've had enough mutiny for one day. Astrid stirs, conflicted, as Stoick stomps toward Skullcrusher, fuming. He passes Ruffnut, who's busily fondling Eret's biceps as he lays crushed under Grump.
RUFFNUT: Ooh, I like that.
STOICK: HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 34.
RUFFNUT: ( PETULANT )
HICCUP: Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise. Toothless' ear plates perk up. He glances over his shoulder to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds. A strange and arresting MASKED WARRIOR rises from the clouds, standing upon something unseen. Its armor and cape flap in the buffeting turbulence. The warrior eyes Toothless and Hiccup, pulling up alongside them. Hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery and sits up, flustered.
HICCUP: HEY! YOU LEFT MY DRAGON BACK THERE! HE CAN'T FLY ON HIS OWN! HE'LL The warrior offers no response, seemingly immune to the cold as he leads the dragon flock across the polar night an alien landscape, harsh and foreboding. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 36. Out of the fog looms an EPIC ICE FORMATION jagged, spiked, and similar to the icy aftermath of Eret's fort, but many times its size. The DRAGON ESCORT dives into its jagged folds.
DROWN!: The warrior offers no response, seemingly immune to the cold as he leads the dragon flock across the polar night an alien landscape, harsh and foreboding. Out of the fog looms an EPIC ICE FORMATION jagged, spiked, and similar to the icy aftermath of Eret's fort, but many times its size. The DRAGON ESCORT dives into its jagged folds.
HICCUP: We have to head back for my dragon! A HISSING dragon CLOSES IN, sniffing, leering, aggressive. Hiccup extends and lights his telescoping dragon blade, waving a swirl of fire around himself. The dragon pauses, intrigued, and then watches hypnotically as Hiccup pacifies him with calculated sweeps of the fiery blade. The warrior watches keenly from the shadows. Several aggressive dragons close in behind Hiccup. Hearing their hisses, he quickly stows the blade, replaces a cartridge in its hilt, then flips it around and sprays a perimeter of Zippleback gas around himself. He clicks the lighter, igniting a flash ring. The testy dragons recoil. He then reaches through the smoke, offering his open hand. The dragons re-approach, sniffing him with calmed curiosity.
WARRIOR: ( whispered, shaken ) Could it be? After all these years? How is this possible? The voice is surprisingly female.
HICCUP: Uh, should I. should I know you?
WARRIOR: No. You were only a babe. The warrior slowly removes the strange mask, revealing VALKA, 40, beneath. Her eyes meet his, equally wide-eyed and aghast.
VALKA: . but a mother never forgets. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 38. Hiccup stammers, tongue-tied, aghast.
STOICK: Boar-headed! Just like his mother! She could never stay put either. Gobber glances over at Stoick, who's hunched over, brow furrowed and solemn.
GOBBER: Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking. I mean, could there be a worse combination? Ha! When I think of how stubborn and senseless YOU were back in the day. well, not much has changed, actually.
STOICK: You know what he's like. He won't give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup finds Drago, before we find him.
GOBBER: Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so long as that Night Fury's around. It's a Night Fury! Framed by a hole in the ice, a glistening object bobs on the surface below. Stoick squints and CIRCLES BACK, leading Skullcrusher in a DIVE toward it. Stoick SNAGS it out of the water. It's Hiccup's helmet. Gobber pulls alongside Stoick, seeing his look of dread. Stoick holds the helmet out for his dragon to SMELL.
STOICK: Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him. Skullcrusher SNIFFS the helmet like a bloodhound, ROARS, and suddenly CHANGES HEADING. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 39.
HICCUP: Hold on! Wait just a minute! Come back here!
VALKA: This way. Come.
HICCUP: You can't just say something like that and run off! You're my mother?! I mean, what the do you grasp how INSANE it sounds?!
VALKA: Come. Quickly! Hiccup follows her over the difficult terrain. He tries to clamber over a tall rock, unsuccessfully.
HICCUP: Where have you been all this time? Toothless boosts him over. Hiccup lands on the other side.
HICCUP: This is where you've been for twenty years? She nods from her perch.
VALKA: You're not upset?
HICCUP: What? No. I don't know. It's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank. It's not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon Valka chuckles, and using her dragon's wing, lowers herself to the ground like a skilled acrobat.
VALKA: At least I'm not boring. right?
HICCUP: I suppose there is that. ( feeble, trailing off ) . one. specific. thing. Excited dragons rush up to greet Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup pets a few, marveling at the vast dragon utopia before him.
VALKA: Do you like it?
HICCUP: I don't have the words. Toothless SNARLS in annoyance as the curious, smothering dragons SNIFF every part of him.
VALKA: Can I. ? He's beautiful! She reaches out to stroke Toothless, who PURRS at her touch. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 41.
HICCUP: I found him in the woods. He was shot down and wounded. She winces and offers a sympathetic nod as she stands to caress a few of her own rescued dragons.
VALKA: This Snafflefang lost his leg to one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps. This Raincutter had her wing sliced by razor netting. And this poor Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree snare. then left to die alone and ( re: Toothless' tail ) And what of this? Did Drago or his trappers do this, too?
HICCUP: Heh. Well, crazy thing is. I'm actually the one who shot him down. She glares, confused.
VALKA: What did your father think of your Night Fury friend?
HICCUP: He didn't take it all that well. She mutters in agreement.
VALKA: If only it were possible.
HICCUP: No, really, I
VALKA: Believe me, I tried, as well. But people are not capable of change, Hiccup. Some of us. were just born different.
FLASHBACK: Dragons sweep from the sky, blowing FIRE, carrying off sheep and dried fish. Vikings chase them down, hurling weapons.
VALKA: Stop! You'll only make it worse! The dragon takes wing, escaping to safety. leaving the Viking warrior glaring at Valka.
VALKA: INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Cloudjumper enters the house through the hole in the roof, sniffing out a baby's cradle in the corner. Valka rushes in, panicked.
FLASHBACK CONTINUED: Cloudjumper enters the house through the hole in the roof, sniffing out a baby's cradle in the corner. Valka rushes in, panicked.
STOICK: Valka, run! Alarmed, Cloudjumper WHIRLS around at Stoick and BLASTS! Stoick DIVES out of the way as the FIRE SPLATTERS against the wall, burning a hole and setting the room ablaze. The dragon moves toward Stoick, but Valka grabs hold. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 44.
VALKA: It turns to face her again, locking eyes, agitated.
STOICK: Hold on! Stoick dashes through the fire toward Hiccup and pulls him out of the cradle. He pulls his axe from the pillar.
STOICK: ( DISTANT )
VALKA!: ( DISTANT )
VALKA: ( DISTANT )
STOICK: ON BABY HICCUP'S FACE, with the fresh nick on his chin.
PRESENT DAY: HICCUP'S FACE, with the matching scar.
VALKA: You and your father nearly died that night, all because I couldn't kill a dragon.
HICCUP: Yeah, it runs in the family.
VALKA: It broke my heart to stay away, but I believed you'd be safer if I did. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 45. Hiccup considers this, then raises his eyes to hers, seeing the sting of remorse.
HICCUP: How did you survive?
VALKA: Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm me. He must've thought I belonged She leads him to the edge of raised natural terrace, overlooking the steamy oasis with its flowing hot spring waterfalls. Half-submerged in the warm lake below, a massive white dragon with pronounced, mammoth-like tusks rests benevolently on the banks, his stately countenance like that of a lion surrounded by his pride.
HICCUP: Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's responsible for all that He protects us. We all live under his care. And his command. They pass an eggshell-littered NURSERY. HATCHLINGS dart out of it, greeting them excitedly and inciting chaos. Toothless is overwhelmed by their manic picking and scratching. Cloudjumper balks and sends them scattering.

HICCUP: She chuckles, delighting in his awe.
VALKA: You must be hungry.
HICCUP: Uh, yeah. I could eat.
VALKA: Good. It's feeding time. Toothless tucks himself beneath Cloudjumper's wing, trying to befriend him, but Cloudjumper isn't having any of it. He grimaces and follows Valka out.
ASTRID: I don't like it. They should've been back with Hiccup by now. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 47.
RUFFNUT: I don't like it either. Eret son of Eret was the man of my dreams. My But, baby, I grew facial hair for Fishlegs strokes his peach fuzz beard, meek and dejected.
SNOTLOUT: But, baby, I grew facial hair for Fishlegs strokes his peach fuzz beard, meek and dejected.
FISHLEGS: Me, too.
ASTRID: What if Drago shot them down? What if they need our help?
FISHLEGS: ( NERVOUSLY )
ASTRID: It doesn't matter what he said, if they've all been captured. Come on! She flies off, determined.
ERET: We've nowhere to go! Nothing to sell! And no heads to call our own, if we don't turn up with dragons and fast He's suddenly scooped up in Stormfly's talons.
ASTRID: Careful what you wish for!
ERET: What is this?!
ASTRID: A kidnapping. Ruffnut grabs his leg, clutching him possessively.
RUFFNUT: Yay! Can he ride with me? Can he? Can he? Both Eret and Tuffnut groan in protest.
ASTRID: You're gonna show us the way to And help dragon riders sneak into Drago's camp? Just kill me now.
ERET: And help dragon riders sneak into Drago's camp? Just kill me now.
ASTRID: That can be arranged. Stormfly, drop it. In enthusiastic response, Stormfly pops open her talons, sending Eret plummeting. He wails and flails as he hurtles toward the ice far below.
ERET: ALL RIGHT! OKAY! I'LL TAKE YOU TO Stormfly suddenly SNATCHES him out of his free-fall just before hitting the ice. Astrid giggles and cracks her Works every time. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 49.

ASTRID: Works every time. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 49.
BEGIN MONTAGE: Hiccup and Toothless follow Valka and Cloudjumper over a majestic fjord in the long rays of the low Arctic sun. Hiccup peers over his shoulder to see that a thick flock of dragons nearly all of Valka's rescues are close on their tail. He turns back to his mother, confused.
HICCUP: Hey, I thought we were going to ( with a mischievous grin ) Oh, we are. She directs his gaze below, where in the choppy water of the fjord, a group of Seashocker dragons are corralling a dense shoal of fish near the surface. Suddenly, the Bewilderbeast rises from deep below, scooping the fish up in its vast mouth as its tusks break the surface. It breaches just below Hiccup and Toothless, giving them a fright before spitting the fish into the air and crashing back down into the sea. Valka laughs at Hiccup's surprise as the hungry dragons race for the flailing fish, scooping them out of the air. Hiccup gestures to Toothless to join in and he gladly scoops up a mouth full.

HICCUP: And from Dragon Island, I found this archipelago. He looks up to see that Valka is no longer next to him, but she has sketched out the rest of the northern land masses in the snow, wowing Hiccup with just how far and wide she has HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 50. She returned to Hiccup's side with a smile. But his amazement is interrupted by Toothless joining in, drawing all over Valka's map with a giant icicle. Hiccup simply shrugs as his mother giggles, and Cloudjumper EXT. WINDSWEPT CLIFF - LATER Valka and Hiccup rise on their dragons, carried skyward by a strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline cliff. One by one, dragons leap from the cliff and catch the strong updraft, popping their wings open like kites. They ride the wind and orbit around each other in a colorful, mesmeric dance. It's clearly a form of dragon play. Hiccup, lifted off of his saddle by the force of the wind, laughs giddily as he watches Valka walk across Cloudjumper's wing and onto several others, dragon-hopping from one to another, until she gracefully crosses Toothless from wing tip to wing tip. She then drops out of sight, reappearing a moment later standing atop Cloudjumper. Hiccup is in utter awe of her. Valka breathes in the frigid air. Lets it out blissfully.
VALKA: When I'm up here, I don't even feel the cold. I just feel.
HICCUP: She smiles at Hiccup. He gleams back.
VALKA: This is what it is to be a dragon, Hiccup LOCKS the pedals in the flared tail position and unbuckles himself. Valka watches, curious.
HICCUP: It's all well and good to call yourself a dragon. Hiccup RUNS OFF of Toothless, pulling his stowed wings.
VALKA: Well, not bad yourself. She caresses his cheek, staring deep into his eyes. Hiccup doesn't recoil this time.
HICCUP: Well, not bad yourself. She caresses his cheek, staring deep into his eyes. Hiccup doesn't recoil this time.
VALKA: All this time, you took after me. And where was I?
HICCUP: Did YOU know about this? Valka smiles, delighting in their mutual amazement.
VALKA: Every dragon has its secrets. Toothless pounces around, showing off to Cloudjumper, who seems thoroughly unimpressed.
HICCUP: That sounds. amazing. She pulls him into a hug forceful, bursting with emotion. Hiccup hugs Valka back. They share a cathartic moment, before Hiccup peels away from her.
VALKA: What? There's no talking to Drago.
HICCUP: But we have to
VALKA: No. We must protect our own. Hiccup stares, exasperated by the familiar line. Cloudjumper lumbers over, eager to be rid of Toothless' puppy-like energy. Valka pets him.
ERET: Agghh! Okay! I got you here, now get this thing off me!
ASTRID: Never take a toy from a dragon. Don't you know anything? Stormfly crushes him in place under her weight.
ERET: ( STRAINED )
ASTRID: What's down there? Fishlegs rifles through his note cards contained in his belt Large diameter bubbles, massive lungs, cold water deep dweller, I'm thinking class five leviathan, maybe six. Suddenly, Stormfly is alerted to an encroaching menace and takes wing. BLOW DARTS whiz through the air, hitting the other dragons. The effect is immediate they fall to the ground, unconscious. Drugged.
FISHLEGS: Large diameter bubbles, massive lungs, cold water deep dweller, I'm thinking class five leviathan, maybe six. Suddenly, Stormfly is alerted to an encroaching menace and takes wing. BLOW DARTS whiz through the air, hitting the other dragons. The effect is immediate they fall to the ground, unconscious. Drugged.
HICCUP: Meatlug! What's wrong, girl? Eret spring to his feet and draws his blades. Astrid and the Gang find themselves surrounded by soldiers, camouflaged in polar bear furs, and poised to fire darts. They're outnumbered. Fishlegs raises his hands, dropping the cards.
DRAGO!: Drago turns to see Astrid, Eret, and the Gang being forcibly escorted onto the deck. Eret SHAKES HIMSELF FREE.
SOLDIER #1: Watch out! He's waking up! Keep him Give me some backup here!
SOLDIER #2: Give me some backup here!
DRAGO: Drop the ropes. They do so. Hookfang bucks and roars, chasing off the soldiers, then focusing on Drago as he closes in. The armored dragons avert their eyes and cower as Drago passes. Hookfang HISSES a warning, but Drago approaches, undaunted. Hookfang BLASTS. In a blur, Drago wraps himself in his dragon skin cloak. The sticky, napalm-like fire splatters against the fireproof scales, enveloping Drago in dripping flames as he persists forward without missing a step. As the blast ends, Drago drops the cloak, closing in and holding a cold stare. Hookfang lets out a ferocious ROAR. Drago YELLS back with a fierce, savage scream, interrupting Hookfang and causing him to recoil. Drago whirls his bull- hook overhead and STABS it into the deck planks. Hookfang stirs, his aggression fading in the face of Drago's unflinching show of dominance. After a moment, Hookfang averts his eyes and lowers his head in submission. Drago places his boot upon Hookfang's snout, pressing it into the deck planks.
SNOTLOUT: What are you doing? HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 56.

ASTRID: What are you doing? HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 56.
DRAGO: ( quiet, to the dragon ) You belong to me now.
ERET: And as an added bonus, I also caught you their riders. No extra Drago notices the saddle on Hookfang's back. His eyes wander to the saddle on Meatlug. Alarm flashes in Drago's eyes.
ASTRID: What?! Are you kidding me?!
RUFFNUT: But you were so perfect!
ERET: Turns out, there's a whole bunch of them out there. They In a flash, Drago stops toward Eret and seizes him by the How many? As Eret chokes, stammering, Astrid whispers to the gang.
DRAGO: How many? As Eret chokes, stammering, Astrid whispers to the gang.
ASTRID: Drago doesn't have them after all.
DRAGO: HOW MANY?! Hundreds! A whole island full! His grip tightens around Eret's neck as he turns to Astrid.
HOW MANY?!: Hundreds! A whole island full! His grip tightens around Eret's neck as he turns to Astrid.
ASTRID: Hundreds! A whole island full! His grip tightens around Eret's neck as he turns to Astrid.
ERET: I wouldn't worry about it. My men are hunting them down as we speak. They won't know where you're hiding. I promise you that. Astrid nods a covert signal to the Gang she has a plan.
ASTRID: Oh, yes they will! Drago drops Eret as Astrid advances, staring Drago down. Eret tries to signal her to stop, but it's no use. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 57.
KICK: He's not a problem. Really. Trust He's only the son of Stoick the Drago's eyes narrow upon hearing Stoick's name.
DRAGO: He's not a problem. Really. Trust He's only the son of Stoick the Drago's eyes narrow upon hearing Stoick's name.
ERET: He's not a problem. Really. Trust He's only the son of Stoick the Drago's eyes narrow upon hearing Stoick's name.
ASTRID: He's only the son of Stoick the Drago's eyes narrow upon hearing Stoick's name.
DRAGO: Dragon master? I ALONE control the And unless you let us go, right now, he will blast through here on his Night Fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters! Eret slips away, trying to distance himself from the tension.
TUFFNUT: And unless you let us go, right now, he will blast through here on his Night Fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters! Eret slips away, trying to distance himself from the tension.
FISHLEGS: And unless you let us go, right now, he will blast through here on his Night Fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters! Eret slips away, trying to distance himself from the tension.
ASTRID: And unless you let us go, right now, he will blast through here on his Night Fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters! Eret slips away, trying to distance himself from the tension.
RUFFNUT: Then they'll be crying like babies!
SNOTLOUT: Funny and beautiful.
FISHLEGS: Good one, babe! Ruffnut groans, exasperated by their smarmy advances. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 58.
TUFFNUT: Yeah. Like babies. They always cry. Real tiny ones. Drago grabs Eret by the face and bears down on him.
DRAGO: First there was one rider. And now all of Berk.
ERET: CEASE ALL PREPARATIONS! WE MUST ATTACK THE DRAGONS RIDER'S NEST AT WE WILL TAKE DOWN THEIR ALPHA. AND THEN WE WILL TAKE BERK! Soldiers CHEER in the thousands.
DRAGO: CEASE ALL PREPARATIONS! WE MUST ATTACK THE DRAGONS RIDER'S NEST AT WE WILL TAKE DOWN THEIR ALPHA. AND THEN WE WILL TAKE BERK! Soldiers CHEER in the thousands.
ONCE!: ( SAVORING IT )
ERET: You're overreacting!
DRAGO: And get rid of him.
ERET: Drago, please. The soldiers HURL throwing knives at Eret. But Stormfly lands in a blur of wings, shielding Eret from the flurry of blades. She whips her tail, throwing spikes in all directions.
ASTRID: Stormfly ROARS protectively, hiding Eret within her wings, until a well-blown dart sinks into her neck, bringing her Revealing Eret, gawking in shock.
STORMFLY!: Stormfly ROARS protectively, hiding Eret within her wings, until a well-blown dart sinks into her neck, bringing her Revealing Eret, gawking in shock.
NO!: Revealing Eret, gawking in shock.
HICCUP: ( DETERMINED )
STOICK: Easy now.
HICCUP: Are you kidding me? How'd you get in here?
STOICK: The same way we're getting you out.
HICCUP: Gobber appears in the arch of a tunnel.
GOBBER: All clear!
STOICK: Toothless. Come. They hurry back into the winding corridor.
HICCUP: Dad! There's something you need to Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.
STOICK: Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.
HICCUP: This isn't an on-the-way kind of update, actually. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 60.
STOICK: I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup.
HICCUP: . more of the earth-shattering development variety.
STOICK: Yeah, just add it to the pile.
HICCUP: Dad, unlike most surprises I spring on you, this is one you'll like. I promise! You just have to handle it delicately, so. They round a tight bend in the corridor to find Gobber staring blankly at something unseen in the next chamber. He shuffles past Stoick and Hiccup, dazed.
GOBBER: Uh, you might want to take this one. Oh, boy. Stoick draws his SWORD, then braves into the chamber ahead.
HICCUP: Dad, can you put the sword away. Stoick GASPS as if seeing a ghost. and drops his sword with a clatter. Valka stands some twenty paces ahead of him, blocking the path. She lets out an audible SHUDDER upon seeing him. He removes his helmet slowly as Hiccup, Gobber, and Toothless appear at Stoick's side.
VALKA: ( RATTLED )
GOBBER: This is why I never married.
VALKA: ( TEARFUL )
STOICK: You're as beautiful as the day I lost you. His words snuff her retort, rendering her speechless. She softens despite herself, yielding her cheek to his palm. He caresses her skin as a reluctant tear runs through his fingers. He PULLS her into a KISS. She resists briefly, then gives in. The surrounding dragons softly RETREAT in kind. Hiccup gapes, warmed by the sight of his parents reunited.
SNOTLOUT: Could this day get any worse?
TUFFNUT: Uh, let me see. You'll jump into freezing cold water and then die from drowning. They reach the gang plank. Eret peers overboard at the deep, icy water below.
ERET: Looks refreshing. He turns to Astrid, meeting her glare with mock chivalry.
ASTRID: You are a steaming heap of dragon
ERET: Eret WHIRLS around, ROUND-HOUSING both soldiers. They GO DOWN, heavily. He catches one of their spears with his bound hands and slices his ropes free. They fall away as he catches the other spear, twirling both in invitation.
SOLDIER: Warn the others! One soldier runs to send up the alarm. while the last two raise BLOW DART TUBES. Eret SWIPES the first off of his legs, sending the dart into the neck of the second.
RUFFNUT: Get `em, you son of an Eret! As the downed soldiers SCRAMBLE to their feet, Fishlegs FALLS OVER, CRUSHING them under his weight. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 63. Eret CATCHES the falling tube from the second soldier and BLOWS the dart at the fleeing third. The soldier DROPS, unconscious just shy of the Captain's Quarters.
TUFFNUT: Ugh. Pathetic. You can still jump. Eret avoids Ruffnut and turns to Astrid.
ERET: So? Are we going to save your dragons and get out of here or not? Astrid narrows her eyes, not knowing what to make of him. He reclaims his sword and dagger from the unconscious soldier who took them and cuts Tuffnut free.
ASTRID: ON ERET
ON ERET: Carefully cranking another trap, wincing at the sound. The iron jaws of the trap open wider with every CLICK.
ERET: Anyone coming? Ruffnut "stands guard," fixated on Eret's rippling biceps.
RUFFNUT: I don't know. You just keep doing what you're doing. Keep crankin'. Eret squeezes between the cocked teeth, finding Stormfly within, muzzled and chained. She looks up at Eret, calming immediately. He pauses, then approaches slowly. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 64. Eret carefully reaches out and strokes Stormfly's muzzle.
ERET: Thank you for saving my life.
AFTERNOON: ( Scene 1850 - The Last Dance ) As Toothless and Cloudjumper hover for scraps, Stoick and Valka prepare skewers of fish. She's overwhelmed, lost in her thoughts, and covering it up poorly.
HICCUP: Mom, you'd never recognize it! Where we used to make weapons, we now build saddles, wing slings we even fix dragon teeth! You wouldn't believe how much everything's changed! Valka offers a skittish half-smile and hands him a plate.
STOICK: Our son's changed Berk for the better. I think we did well with this one, Val.
HICCUP: Thanks, Dad. Stoick places his hands on Valka's shoulders. She flinches, dropping the plate. Cloudjumper steals the fish before Toothless can get to it. Toothless whimpers, and as a sign of acceptance, Cloudjumper regurgitates the fish so Toothless can have some.
VALKA: I'm. a little out of practice.
STOICK: ( SWEETLY )
GOBBER: ( to Hiccup and Grump ) I hope not. Her meatballs could kill more beasts than a battle axe.
HICCUP: And once you move back in, with all of your dragons, Drago won't even stand a chance. Everything will be Stoick can see that Valka is overwhelmed. He lays a hand upon Hiccup's shoulder, calming him.
STOICK: Slow down, son. It's a lot to take Oh. Gotcha. Valka crosses the room to fill a flask with water, back turned to the group, as Stoick eyes her sympathetically. He decides on a different approach. and whistles a familiar ON VALKA, as her eyes widen, stirred, recognizing the melody. She turns away from Stoick, as the water overflows from the Oh, I love this one! Stoick approaches her delicately.

STOICK: ( WHISPERED )

STOICK: ( SINGING )
VALKA: ( SINGING )
STOICK: ( SINGING )
VALKA: ( SINGING )
GOBBER: C'mon, Hiccup!
GOBBER: ( SINGING )
HICCUP: I'm done. Valka and Stoick slow to a stop, WINDED and LAUGHING.
GOBBER: I'm done. Valka and Stoick slow to a stop, WINDED and LAUGHING.
STOICK: Ah. I thought I'd have to die before we'd have that dance again. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 68.
VALKA: No need for drastic measures.
STOICK: For you, my dear. anything. She smiles sweetly. Stoick's eyes well with tears. He goes down on one knee, proposing to her anew.
VALKA: Gobber pops his head in.
GOBBER: Great! I'll do the cooking! They laugh.
STOICK: Thank Odin you didn't listen to me, son. We never would have found each Suddenly, Toothless and Cloudjumper suddenly perk up, sensing something unheard. Hiccup notices.
HICCUP: Dragons SWARM past Valka's chamber, racing toward some unknown disturbance.
HICCUP: Oh, no. Valka tries to hurry off, fuming. Stoick stops her.
STOICK: Val! It's all right, it's all right. We're a team now.
VALKA: We have to save the dragons.
STOICK: ( DETERMINED )
DRAGO: Whatever comes, keep hitting the mountain! We need to draw the alpha HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 70. Drago's armored DRAGON ARMY takes wing, clashing with Valka's dragons in the skies.
TUFFNUT: Surprise! Yeah!
DRAGO: They're joined by Astrid and the rest of the GANG, bursting out of the traps atop Meatlug and Hookfang. Eret comes flying out last, WAILING aboard Stormfly. He struggles to hold on, as she rejoins Astrid ( riding Meatlug, along with Fishlegs ). He gives them a sheepish shrug.
WHAT?!: They're joined by Astrid and the rest of the GANG, bursting out of the traps atop Meatlug and Hookfang. Eret comes flying out last, WAILING aboard Stormfly. He struggles to hold on, as she rejoins Astrid ( riding Meatlug, along with Fishlegs ). He gives them a sheepish shrug.
ASTRID: You really are full of surprises. She leaps onto Stormfly, steadying them.
TUFFNUT: Dragon Riders coming through! And DIVE-BOMB the traps, setting them aflame. The yokes and leather bindings restraining the bait dragons are incinerated, freeing them to fly away, unharmed.
DRAGO: CUT THEM DOWN! Projectiles are launched, one of which KNOCKS Ruffnut off her dragon. She PLUMMETS past Eret toward the rocky shore below.
RUFFNUT: Eret, son of Eret! She suddenly grabbed by both arms before hitting the rocks. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 71. RUFFNUT'S POV: of Snotlout on one side. and Fishlegs on the other. SOFT and ROMANTICIZED as her epiphany dawns. Above them, more catapults fire, bringing down massive spires of ice, directly over Astrid and Eret.
ASTRID: Up, girl! To the left, Eret! That's it! Look out! It's about to crush them when. it's BLOWN TO PIECES by Toothless' fireball. Hiccup, Stoick, and Gobber come bursting through the flames on their dragons. Hiccup and Toothless arc across the sky triumphantly and set their sights on a downed dragon surrounded by soldiers. Toothless BLASTS one of Drago's net launchers, knocking it onto its side. Stoick then CHOPS the trigger line, FIRING the catapult and NETTING the throng of soldiers, freeing the Drago's ARCHERS target Stoick with their arrows.
ARCHER: Take `em down!
GOBBER: Heads up! Gobber flies up from behind, KNOCKING the archers out with Grump's tail. Gobber chuckles. DRAGO hears Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream and turns to see him streaking across the sky.
DRAGO: Dragon Master. Hiccup catches up to Astrid and Eret on Stormfly.
HICCUP: Welcome aboard, dragon rider!
ERET: Thanks. I think. Astrid glares, both relieved and annoyed to see Hiccup.
ASTRID: Where have you been?
HICCUP: Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 72. Astrid shoots him a confused glare. He nods skyward. Astrid and Eret look up to see. VALKA, in full warrior garb, rising from the towering ice spikes, atop Cloudjumper.
ERET: An earth-trembling roar follows as the Bewilderbeast rises behind Valka.
ASTRID: That's your mother?!
HICCUP: Well, now you know where I get my dramatic flair. ON DRAGO, gawking in awe as the great BEWILDERBEAST BLASTS an epic explosion of ice upon the attackers.
DRAGO: The alpha! Now we have a fight! Valka blasts overhead on Cloudjumper, commanding swarms of dragons to swoop down and attack Drago's army. A swarm of Zipplebacks set themselves aflame and roll like fiery wagon wheels through the battlefield, scattering soldiers and destroying war machines. One of them gets CAUGHT under a Dragon Swatter, but Hiccup and Toothless double-back for a rescue.
HICCUP: There! Come on, Toothless! Show them what you got, bud. Toothless dive-bombs the swatter and DESTROYS it with a plasma bolt, freeing the dragon.
DRAGO: I've waited a long time for this! Drago cocks his bull hook, ready to strike, but Valka deflects Drago's hit and attacks him. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 73.
VALKA: You cannot take our dragons! They are controlled by the alpha!
DRAGO: ( SMUG )
HICCUP: ( HORRIFIED )
FISHLEGS: I WAS WAY OFF! THAT IS A CLASS TEN! CLASS TEN! Drago's challenger lumbers onto the beach, focused on Valka's No. No.
CLASS TEN!: Drago's challenger lumbers onto the beach, focused on Valka's
VALKA: No. No.
DRAGO: Come on! Take down the alpha! Valka attacks Drago with her bullhook, trying to stop his commands, but Drago strikes back, knocking her forcefully onto her back. He pins her as she struggles, removing her mask and staff. He's about to finish her off, when WHAM! He's knocked to the ground. He looks up, fuming, to see Stoick helping Valka to her feet.
VALKA: Thank you.
STOICK: For you, my dear. anything. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 74. As Drago gathers his weapon and drops his heavy cloak, circling Stoick, Drago's Bewilderbeast confronts Valka's in a threat display.
VALKA: I'll do my best! Come on, Valka cuts the nets away and hops onto Cloudjumper, flying off toward the Bewilderbeasts as they charge each other,
DRAGO: You. I watched you burn! The two imposing warriors CLASH WEAPONS, SLASHING and LANDING
STOICK: It takes more than a little fire to kill me! Valka flies between the Bewilderbeasts, waving her staff commandingly, but to no effect.
GOBBER: Stoick catches it and lands a direct hit on Drago. But, with a devastating SWIPE, DRAGO's Bewilderbeast takes down Valka's, plunging in its tusks and burying its opponent's lifeless body under an avalanche.
VALKA: Hiccup and the others watch in horror as dragons everywhere land and bow their heads in acknowledgement of the new alpha -
DRAGO: We've won. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 75. Drago points his bullhook toward Valka and Cloudjumper.

DRAGO: This. is the great dragon master? The son of Stoick the Vast? What shame he must feel. Toothless snarls, ready to blast, but Hiccup calms him with a hand gesture.
HICCUP: All of this loss, and for what? To become unstoppable? To rule the Drago smirks and turns away from Hiccup.
DRAGO: Or tear them apart. Drago LAUGHS mockingly, then removes his FALSE ARM, revealing a stump at his shoulder. Hiccup is taken aback.
HICCUP: Then why a dragon army?
DRAGO: ( grinning, smug ) Well, you need dragons to conquer other dragons.
HICCUP: Or maybe you need dragons to conquer people.
DRAGO: Clever boy. Drago grabs his bullhook and re-approaches Hiccup. Toothless readies himself.
HICCUP: The world wants peace. And we have the answer, back on Berk. Just let me show you.
DRAGO: NO! Let ME show YOU. Drago SHRIEKS madly, summoning the Bewilderbeast. Toothless circles Hiccup, protectively. ON THE BEWILDERBEAST, about to blast Stoick and Valka. It hears Drago's distant wails, and approaches obediently.
STOICK: Stoick follows its stare to the distant battlefield below. He spots Hiccup and Toothless a few paces from Drago.
GOBBER: Okay, change of plans. He hurries back down the mountain after them.
DRAGO: No dragon can resist the alpha's command. So he who controls the alpha, controls them all. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 78. Drago points to Toothless. The Bewilderbeast stares and HISSES, forcing Toothless to cower under a hypnotic ultrasonic broadcast. Toothless struggles against the alpha's command, writhing and grinding his head against the ground.
HICCUP: Toothless? You okay, bud? What's going on? Toothless fights the command, shaking his head in protest. The Bewilderbeast insists, with a mesmerizing glare and a low, throaty grumble. until Toothless finally succumbs to its control. He raises his head, his stare vacant and robotic, as his pupils turn to slits. Drago then points to Hiccup. The Bewilderbeast responds, HISSING again at Toothless.
DRAGO: Witness true strength. The strength of will over others. In the face of it, you are nothing. Toothless slowly turns to face Hiccup. Advancing.
HICCUP: Uh, what did he just tell you?

SON!: Hiccup sees Stoick about to run into the fray.
HICCUP: DAD! NO! Toothless BLASTS. Stoick leaps in front of it, shoving Hiccup out of the way and absorbing the blast in the process. He's thrown against the ice with great impact. ON VALKA, hearing the blast, horrified. Drago glances back, seeing Stoick laying lifeless in the aftermath, pleased by the sudden turn of events. He shuffles off, satisfied. Stunned, Hiccup comes to and sees Stoick in the rubble. He rushes past the still-entranced Toothless, straining to scatter the ice boulders on top of Stoick's body.

VALKA: She helps Hiccup to turn Stoick's body over. Valka presses her ear to Stoick's heart, confirming his death with a mere glance to Hiccup. He tears up, overwhelmed.
HICCUP: No. you. Gobber, Astrid, Eret, and the Gang arrive, slack-jawed. Satisfied, the Bewilderbeast turns away, releasing Toothless of the trance-like state. Toothless blinks, coming to and confused. He approaches the group, sniffing Stoick's hand. Hiccup SHOVES him.
VALKA: It's not his fault. You know that. On the battlefield, the alpha BELLOWS, calling all of the dragons to gather. Meatlug, Stormfly, Hookfang and the others all follow the command as the Gang calls after them.
DRAGO: GATHER THE MEN AND MEET AT BERK! His soldiers cheer in the thousands.
HICCUP: Hiccup tries to go after Toothless, but Valka holds him back.
VALKA: No, don't! Drago JABS his bull hook and points toward the horizon. The alpha BELLOWS, commanding an exodus as it leads the way.

HICCUP: I'm sorry, Dad. He eyes the engulfed ship.
VALKA: You came early into this world. You were such a wee thing. So frail, so fragile. I feared you wouldn't make Hiccup lowers his eyes, but Valka lifts his chin.
HICCUP: I was so afraid of becoming my dad. Mostly because I thought I never could. How do you become someone that great? That brave? That I guess you can only try. ( to the others ) A chief protects his own. We're going back.
TUFFNUT: Uh, with what?
RUFFNUT: He took all the dragons.
HICCUP: Not all of them.
RUFFNUT: Fly straight!
FISHLEGS: I don't want to die!
TUFFNUT: We can't fly these things!
FISHLEGS: Yeah, no kidding! Fishlegs barrels into a snow bank, sending several chunks right into Eret's face as rides inverted and HOLLERING.
ASTRID: But won't that Bewilderbeast just take control of these guys, too?
HICCUP: They're babies. They don't listen to anyone!
TUFFNUT: Yeah, just like us! Gobber follows up the rear clumsily, STRUGGLING for control.
GOBBER: This. is. very dangerous! He PULLS ALONGSIDE Hiccup and Valka.
HICCUP: Well, it's a good thing that I never listen. A SHARP RIDGE RUSHES up at them. They're going to CRASH. Hiccup ROUNDS one side of it, and Gobber flies down the other side. They shout through gaps in the iceberg.
GOBBER: So what IS your plan?!
HICCUP: Get Toothless back and kick Drago's- He's interrupted by another closure in the gaps of ice. They blast out of the other side. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 84.
GOBBER: Heads up! They SPLIT to avoid another peak and then reconvene, only to find another icy outcropping directly in their path.
HICCUP: And that thing. Gobber HITS it, with a THUD and a YELP.
HOARK: Ah, that's a good boy! The Gronckle's eyes suddenly turn to slits and it, too, takes wing, knocking over a chair and table as it heads for the Watch the furniture! Where are you It barrels out of the hut and into the night sky as the Viking rushes to the doorway, spotting the same arresting sight with a gasp. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 85.
DRAGO: Your chief is dead. Waves of shock and whispers of "Stoick?" spread through the No one can protect you now. He thrusts his bull-hook, commanding the Bewilderbeast to fire. The Vikings watch in horror as the Bewilderbeast opens its yawning jaws and BLASTS.
HICCUP: He took all the dragons!
FISHLEGS: He took all the dragons!
HICCUP: ( FUMING )
TUFFNUT: Uh. how?
ERET: Have you forgotten who you're riding with? He brazenly aims his baby dragon toward the Bewilderbeast. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 86.
SNOTLOUT: The others shrug and follow. As they get closer, the Bewilderbeast looms bigger and BIGGER. Berk's Vikings in hiding notice Hiccup and the others as they The Vikings CHEER. ON DRAGO, surprised to see Hiccup and the others approaching.
VIKING #1: Look, it's Hiccup! The Vikings CHEER. ON DRAGO, surprised to see Hiccup and the others approaching.
DRAGO: With an irate HUFF, the Bewilderbeast focuses on Hiccup, gaining ever closer to Toothless. Suddenly, a SHEEP appears in its sight, rising and falling out of view. The Bewilderbeast blinks, confused. It looks down to see Eret catching the falling sheep and reloading it into the game launcher, as Tuffnut cocks the mechanism and Ruffnut pulls the trigger.
RUFFNUT: Keep `em coming! Snotlout tosses the black sheep to Tuffnut.
SNOTLOUT: Black sheep, baby! Exasperated, the alpha inhales, about to blast, when. HONK! The game horn blares, breaking his concentration. He turns, finding the horn unmanned. The Bewilderbeast then returns his focus to the sheep launcher, until the BLACK SHEEP LANDS on the his face, bouncing down his facial spines and becoming lodged. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 87.
FISHLEGS: I'm okay!
DRAGO: You certainly are hard to get rid of. I'll say that. Hiccup ignored him and focuses on Toothless' slitted pupils.
HICCUP: Toothless? It's me, bud. It's me. I'm right here. Come back to me. TOOTHLESS' POV: Hiccup appears as an unfamiliar red blur, still firmly under the control of the Bewilderbeast.
DRAGO: He is not yours anymore. He belongs to the alpha! Drago smugly sits back in the saddle, his arms open in But, please, oh great dragon master, try to take him. He will not miss a second time. Hiccup holds strong, maintaining eye contact with Toothless. He reaches out to touch him. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 88.
HICCUP: It wasn't your fault, bud. They made you do it. Drago's amusement fades as Toothless stirs. His pupils DILATE, then NARROW again.
DRAGO: How are you doing that? Hiccup holds the stare, tears in his eyes.
HICCUP: Please. You are my best friend, Bewilderbeast ROARS a forceful command.
DRAGO: Toothless ROARS defiantly, snatches the bull hook in his jaws, and PULLS. yanking Drago off of his back and sending him both PLUMMETING to the sea.
HICCUP: But without a rider, Toothless drops out of the sky as well. Hiccup leaps from the baby dragon, diving after him.
DRAGO: Do something!
HICCUP: We need to get those two apart. Hiccup flies Toothless past a flag pole tears a strip of the The Bewilderbeast BLASTS in their direction, barely missing them as they disappear around the back of a mountain.
ASTRID: Take them down, babe! The Viking roar in support as Hiccup and Toothless race past. Valka watches with pride as her son hurtles towards Drago and the alpha.
VALKA: Go get `em.
DRAGO: Take control of it! The Bewilderbeast's HISS becomes a furious ROAR, but to no avail. Hiccup clamps his hands over Toothless' ear plates, muffling the alpha's commands.
HICCUP: Shut it out, Toothless!
DRAGO: STOP THEM! The Bewilderbeast BLASTS!
STOP THEM!: The Bewilderbeast BLASTS!
HICCUP: Toothless suddenly PULLS UP, ARCING over Drago's head! Drago LAUGHS, victorious, then pauses in shock. DRAGO'S POV: as Toothless climbs inverted through the sky, the blindfold falls free, revealing an EMPTY SADDLE. Drago WHIRLS around, wide-eyed, to see. HICCUP ZOOMING TOWARD HIM, his wing-suit deployed, and his Dragon Blade trailing Zippleback gas. Drago SWIPES but misses him. Hiccup clicks the lighter and ignites the gas, blasting Drago off his Bewilderbeast with a SCREAM. Drago PLUMMETS, BREAKING HIS FALL against the massive dragon's spines and landing hard on the ground, his bullhook landing just out of reach. The Bewilderbeast WHIPS its tail, trying to SWAT down Hiccup.

DRAGO: ( GRINNING KNOWINGLY )
HICCUP: Oh, no! HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 92. It BLASTS, but Toothless leaps into the way, shielding Hiccup beneath him. The freezing explosion envelops them both. Drago laughs to himself as Valka lands her baby dragon and rushes to the icy explosion, hammering away at it No! No. ON ASTRID and GOBBER, watching from a distance, horrified. As Valka POUNDS at the ice, a GLOWS forms from deep within. She realizes what is about to happen and backs away. A BLAST thunders from inside the ice, SHATTERING it. Toothless emerges from the debris, revealing Hiccup curled safely under his wings. Toothless is steaming, his black skin glowing blue with rage, his split dorsal blades searing with blue heat, a glow emanating from his flared nostrils. He turns back to Hiccup, to check if he's unharmed, then turns his full attention back to the Bewilderbeast. He leaps out of the crater and lands upon an ice spire, roaring The Bewilderbeast bellows back at this affront. Toothless unleashes a salvo of plasma into the Bewilderbeast's face, not letting up.

HICCUP: He's challenging the alpha!
VALKA: To protect you. The Bewilderbeast ROARS at this act of insubordination. Toothless fires back, time and again, fully in control. The alpha thrashes his tusks through the ice, trying to smash Toothless, but he deftly spring from spire to spire, continuing his unrelenting attack. In the midst of the mayhem, the horde of commandeered dragons both Berk's and Valka's break free from the control to witness Toothless' retaliation. Toothless lands protectively by Hiccup and Valka, commanding the dragons to shift sides. The follow, amassing behind Seeing this, Drago panics and rushes toward the HTTYD 2 ( D.

DRAGO: No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight!

HICCUP: Now do you get it? This is what it is to earn a dragon's loyalty.
DRAGO: Never! Come on! He hammers the Bewilderbeast, spurring it into a charge. Toothless calls over his shoulder, commanding the dragons to ready themselves. He then BLASTS the Bewilderbeast, mid- charge. Suddenly, Skullcrusher fires. Followed by another, and another. Hiccup looks around, amazed to see the flock of dragons opening fire on Drago and his Bewilderbeast. They've started a rebellion. Drago is forced to hide from the fiery barrage by taking cover in the tall spines of the giant's crown.
HICCUP: The alpha protects them all. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 94. Overwhelmed and overpowered, the Bewilderbeast yields to the new alpha and heeds Toothless' command, retreating into the sea in an explosive splash. The Berkians CHEER in victory! As the smoke clears, Hiccup and Toothless see nothing but bubbles on the waves to mark their disappearance. No sign of the Bewilderbeast. or Drago. Toothless hops down from the spire, cooling off, as people celebrate all around them. All of the dragons Berk's, Valka's, even Drago's land around Toothless.

ASTRID: Stormfly bounds into Astrid.
GOBBER: Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy! Grump lands ON TOP of Gobber, flattening him. Relieved to the point of tears, Snotlout and Fishlegs race towards the expectant Ruffnut.
FISHLEGS: Who's my little princess? . and then right PAST her to embrace their dragons. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 95.
SNOTLOUT: Don't you ever leave again, Ruffnut GRUMBLES, dejected. Barf dips his head in to console Oh Barf! She hugs him. Belch looms in for some affection, but Ruffnut pushes him away.
RUFFNUT: Oh Barf! She hugs him. Belch looms in for some affection, but Ruffnut pushes him away.
ERET: That was some pretty fine dragon wrangling back there. You'd make a good trapper. Before Hiccup can respond, Skullcrusher nuzzles Eret affectionately. Eret chuckles and gently strokes him.
HICCUP: Y'know, Skullcrusher's gonna need somebody to look after him now.
ERET: Hiccup nods reassuringly. Eret looks at Skullcrusher, pausing to consider it.
VALKA: Your father. he'd be every bit as proud as I am. HTTYD 2 ( D. DeBlois ) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 96.
HICCUP: Thank you. I'm really glad you're here, Mom.
VALKA: And here I'll stay. Toothless arrives, purring at Valka's touch as Astrid strides toward Hiccup, beaming proudly.
ASTRID: See? I told you it was in here. She places her hand upon his chest, then quickly pokes the dorsal fin button, popping it open. She GIGGLES.
HICCUP: Ha, ha. Still doing that one? That's hilarious.
GOBBER: Gothi, the elder, taps Hiccup's shoulder, interrupting the romantic moment. She gestures for Hiccup to kneel. He does so, respectfully. Using ash from a heap of burnt wreckage, Gothi traces a Viking symbol onto Hiccup's forehead. She bows. Hiccup stands, meeting Gobber's proud, smiling eyes. Gobber turns to the silent crowd and throws up his arms.
OUR DRAGONS!: Toothless lets out a proud roar as Hiccup look out over Berk, gleaming with pride.
