BIK: That's what I came to talk to you about.
PAUL: Excuse me?
BIK: The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite Leave it to me.

ODETTE: Good to see you, Paul.
TATIANA: You will not stay for dinner.
ODETTE: No thank you, Tatiana.
PAUL: My best to Jean Baptiste.
PAUL: ( a sigh ) Thomas wants advice?
TATIANA: He wants your wisdom.
PAUL: Let's have dinner first.
TATIANA: Of course.
PAUL: Hello, Anais.
CARINE: I am Carine.
PAUL: You are not Anais?

ROGER: For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
PAUL: Thank you, Roger.
ROGER: Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?

ROGER: It's done.
TATIANA: And he did extra chores.
PAUL: Wash your things, and be back soon.
ROGER: Let's feed it.
ROGER: Let me.
THOMAS: I've heard bad things, Paul. My assistant says we should get out of Rwanda.
FEDENS: Why should we leave? I have a new job, things have never been better for us.
THOMAS: What good is it if we are murdered in our Your assistant, he is Hutu?
TATIANA: Your assistant, he is Hutu?
THOMAS: Yes, and he is in the Hutu Power Militia.
CARINE: He wants your job.
THOMAS: No, he is a friend, but he tells me to listen to the radio. All day they talk about the great slaughter.
TATIANA: That station is filth.
PAUL: Today I talked to my friend the American Ambassador and Colonel Oliver of the United Nations. They are preparing a banquet for the peace signing. The BBC are flying in their best reporters. The world is watching. There will be peace. Don't listen to this man.
ROGER: There are soldiers.
PAUL: On the street.
ROGER: On the street.
E: between the gate hinge and the gate post.
TATIANA: What is it?
PAUL: Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a Please, be quiet.
TATIANA: Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a Please, be quiet.
PAUL: Please, be quiet.
TATIANA: I'm going to talk to them.

TATIANA: I'll fix a bed.
TATIANA: Why didn't you call your contacts in the I couldn't help.
PAUL: I couldn't help.
TATIANA: You could have asked for a favor.
PAUL: No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals? All day long I work to please this officer, that diplomat, this tourist. To store up favors so that if there is a time when my family need help I have powerful people I can call upon. Now you would have me waste a precious favor on a Victor was not a stranger, he was our He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
TATIANA: Victor was not a stranger, he was our He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
PAUL: He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
TATIANA: They do not have your connections.
PAUL: Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good
PAUL: Welcome, gentlemen.
GLORIA: We reserved five rooms not two
GREGOIRE: I'm sorry, ma'am, but I see only two here in the computer.
JOCK: Paul, how the hell are ya'?
PAUL: I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
JOCK: They moved you from the Diplomat?
PAUL: Promoted. House Manager.
JOCK: Good for you.
PAUL: Let me check.
PAUL: Ah, I see the mistake. You were reading CBC - the Canadian broadcasting people instead of BBC Gregoire.
GLORIA: Great, I really need a shower.
PAUL: Just give me a moment to get your keys.
GLORIA: Benedict, beautiful name. I'm Gloria Fleming. BBC.
GREGOIRE: There are no more rooms.
PAUL: Give me the phone.
GLORIA: There are rumors, General, that your army, the Hutu army, consider these peace accords a sellout to the Tutsi rebels.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: ( laughs ) Nonsense. At this moment we are making plans to rehabilitate the dissidents into our armed forces.
GLORIA: Then the army fully supports the president as he signs the peace Of course, the president is a clever man, he knows what he is doing. Thank you for coming to Rwanda. ( on the move ). You will see what a beautiful country this is.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Of course, the president is a clever man, he knows what he is doing. Thank you for coming to Rwanda. ( on the move ). You will see what a beautiful country this is.
PAUL: Forgive the hurry but I do not want you to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle steamer across the lake. It is the most spectacular sight in all Africa.
OB: Lunch? All we do is eat. I thought there was famine in Africa.
PAUL: Exactly, we can't have our guests starving. What would they think of the Mille Collines back in the United States?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Keep that cockroach Benedict away from
PAUL: Same as last time.
GLORIA: Good. I'd like to book a massage.
PAUL: Of course.
JOCK: Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
PAUL: I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
JOCK: Can we phone them in, Paul?
PAUL: I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish. Ah, Zozo.
JOCK: Zozo! The very man!
COMMENTATOR: As president Habyarimana signs a peace accord between the Tutsi rebels and his Hutu army there remains strong doubts that the extremist Hutu Power will abide by the accords. But for now hope has returned to Rwanda for the first time in many years.
COLONEL OLIVER: To Peace.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Paul, join us.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Have a drink.
GEORGE: Look at them, they want to see the tribes dance to their tune. Here is our dance.
PAUL: Forgive me, George, my step was off.
GEORGE: To our president. May he find peace.
PAUL: Excuse me, gentlemen.
THOMAS: Forgive us, Paul. We must talk.
PAUL: What's wrong?
THOMAS: We are leaving Rwanda, Paul.
PAUL: Go to the terrace, I will join you.
CUT TO: EXT. HOTEL POOL TERRACE. NIGHT Drinks are served at a table as Paul listens to Thomas.
THOMAS: My assistant, the Hutu Power man, says we should get out now, that soon it will be very bad.
PAUL: Give me this man's name.
THOMAS: His name is Naramaranga, but please, Paul, even though he is Hutu Power, he is a friend, he likes me. He told me there is a signal. It is "Cut the tall trees." When they hear the signal, the militia are to go to war.
FEDENS: Please, let us take Tatiana with us. You are Hutu, you will be safe.
PAUL: Thomas, Fedens, I am a man who looks after his family. If there were danger I would be the first to leave?
FEDENS: What was that?
PAUL: Calm yourself, it is fireworks to celebrate the peace.
THOMAS: Please, Paul, tomorrow I will bring you my car. You will sell it for me and get a fair price. We will go to Tanzania until there is real peace.
ZOZO: Excuse me, Paul, you have a call.
PAUL: ello. Tatsi. Yes, they are here. Yes. I know but I want them to calm down.
PAUL: Call when you get home. And don't worry, Thomas. Good night.
PAUL: From among the faces, Tatiana's voice heavy with relief.
TATIANA: Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
PAUL: Jean Baptiste!
JEAN BAPTISTE: Our house has been burned.
PAUL: What is going on?
TATIANA: The president has been murdered.
PAUL: Murdered! By whom?
ODETTE: The radio says Tutsi rebels.
PAUL: Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill the president when he agreed to peace?
TATIANA: Where are Thomas and Fedens?
PAUL: I sent them home. Go and call them.
TATIANA: I tried already. The phones do not work.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Our great president is murdered, by the Tutsi cockroaches. They tricked him, then they killed him. We must cleanse this country, Good Hutus of Rwanda. We must clear the brush. Clear the brush of all cockroaches. Clear the brush!!!
PAUL: Come on, everyone out of this room, find a seat in the living room.
TATIANA: They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
PAUL: Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
TATIANA: Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
PAUL: They know you are Tutsi!
TATIANA: Please, Paul, 'til first light.
PAUL: Dawn. Then they go.
ODETTE: Forgive me, Paul. Danielle says that Roger has gone.
TATIANA: Gone where? Tell me, Danielle.
DANIELLE: Next door, mama. He was afraid for his friend Simon. He went to fetch him.
PAUL: SHOUTS next door. Paul pulls Tatiana behind the car. A beat. More SHOUTS. Paul takes his hand from her mouth. She's sobbing.
E: EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD. NIGHT Roger crawls to the gap in the shrubs. Feet, a crowd, leaving, through a gate. Engines rev.
PAUL: Paul drags his son through the chainlink fence, whisks him up in his arms and rushes him to the house.
TATIANA: Paul turns the flashlight on Roger. Tatiana pulls back in horror: Roger is covered in blood. Her SCREAMS, stifled by fear.
PAUL: Where are you hurt, son?
ODETTE: Get his clothes off.
PAUL: What happened, son? Where did you get this blood?
ODETTE: He's not injured.
PAUL: Leave us, give us some space.

PAUL: Let me explain.
CAPTAIN: SHOOT THEM!
SHOOT THEM!: Paul looks at him.
PAUL: Please, I don't use guns.
CAPTAIN: There is nothing to it.
PAUL: Captain, what could I pay you not to do
CAPTAIN: You want to pay me?

GLORIA: We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
COLONEL OLIVER: Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.

ABENA PRESIDENT: Can I have your name again?
SABENA PRESIDENT: Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?

SABENA PRESIDENT: Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
PAUL: There is one thing I need right away.
PAUL: This is my letter of appointment, signed by Mr. Godefroid, the president of Sabena. The Mille Collines is a five star establishment, we will run it that way. If you don't want to work for me, then leave now.

PAUL: Give him time.
GLORIA: Okay, we're feeding through live now.
GLORIA: Okay London .. and five four three two one .That's correct Tom. Today's gruesome ambush of a ten man Belgian patrol has left the UN peacekeeping force in a state of disarray. Its commander has called for re-enforcements. However, the General Council is deeply divided. The United States, still smarting from the UN's disastrous Somalia mission, has indicated that it will veto any moves to reinforce. Meanwhile, the slaughter goes on. Gloria Brooks in Kigali, Rwanda.
GLORIA: And, cut .good, give me a call guys, let me know you've got it.

MR. GARINDI: No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
TATIANA: My brother, his wife. Did this woman know of them? Did they leave the children with
PAUL: This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is Please go back, bring the children to us.
TATIANA: ( to the businessman ) Please go back, bring the children to us.
MR. GARINDI: ( frightened )No ma'am, I cannot do that. The roadblocks are everywhere. They are looking for children. They shout, "Kill the babies to clear the infestation." Leave them be, they are safe. I have to go now.
PAUL: Thank you for your help.
TATIANA: My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
PAUL: No. They are not dead. Stop this.
FRENCH TOURISTS: Mon Dieu, Merci.

COLONEL OLIVER: They're only taking the whites.
PAUL: Children, go into the hallway.
TATIANA: What's wrong?
PAUL: All the whites are leaving.
TATIANA: What about us?
PAUL: We have been abandoned.
TATIANA: The soldiers will stop the killers.
PAUL: Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
TATIANA: But who is left?
PAUL: I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
TATIANA: What for?

JOCK: I know that, Paul. I'm sorry. Here take this.
PAUL: This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
JOCK: Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
GLORIA: Let's go, Jock.

PRESIDENT: If British Airways abandons the route we should bid for it.
PRESIDENT: Paul. Are you alright?
RESIDENT: Out? Where are you going?
PAUL: I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
PRESIDENT: All. What do you mean all?
PAUL: The staff, the guests.
PRESIDENT: The staff and guests! How many?
PAUL: Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left. I wish I could have done more, sir. Please, thank all my friends at Sabena. You have been good to me and my family.
PRESIDENT: ( panicked ) Paul, wait, wait, I'm going to put you on hold for one minute, stay on the phone.
PRESIDENT: Get the prime minister's office. Call General Chareaux. Louis get the UN. Tell them this is Belgian property.

LIEUTENANT: Where's the guest list?
PAUL: The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
LIEUTENANT: Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
PAUL: That will take time.
LIEUTENANT: You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.

PAUL: They are gone. Thank you, sir. What did you do?
SABENA PRESIDENT: I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
SABENA PRESIDENT: Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
PAUL: SABENA PRESIDENT
SABENA PRESIDENT: I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
PAUL: There will be no rescue, no intervention force. We can only save ourselves. Call any foreigner you know, tell them what will happen to us. Say goodbye but when you say goodbye, say it as though you're reaching through and shaking their hand. Let them know if they let go of that hand, you will die. ( silence ) We must shame them into sending help.
PAUL: Send two of the housekeeping carpenters to the lobby.
TUTSI WOMAN: I cannot pay?
PAUL: Go with Zozo to the ballroom. We will find you bedding. This is a hotel. No one will be allowed to stay in the lobby.
CARPENTER: What shall we put in their place.
PAUL: Nothing. I want no numbers on the doors.
PAUL: Good day. Here is your bill for the last week. If you cannot pay, or think you will not be able to pay, go to the ballroom. Zozo will take care of you.
XAVIER: Come in Paul.
PAUL: I'm afraid you will have to move room.
XAVIER: Move? Where to?
PAUL: I'm going to put you on the third floor.
XAVIER: The third floor are low class rooms.
PAUL: Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
XAVIER: ( to his wife ) Pack the bags, we have to move.
PAUL: Also, this is your bill for the last
MONTAGE: Paul and influential refugees, Odette, Benedict ( with a bandage over his missing ear ), Xavier and others call, plead, write and send faxes all around the world. We see this NIGHT and DAY; DAY and NIGHT
ODETTE: Yes, that's right. I helped set up the treatment center in Nairobi. I'm in the Mille Collines Hotel right now with my husband, Peter, and my two boys. If you do not help us we will be murdered.
ZOZO: Sir, General Bizimungu is here.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: I am glad you are well.
PAUL: I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: As long as it is scotch. Your white friends have abandoned you, The United Nations are still here.
PAUL: The United Nations are still here.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: ( laughs ) The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you. ( chugs his drink ) Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
PAUL: Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: What did you overhear?
PAUL: A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: What did they say?
PAUL: The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Watch everything? How? They are gone.
PAUL: GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
PAUL: Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
ENERAL BIZIMUNGU: And what will they do with these The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
PAUL: The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: The high command? Our high command?
PAUL: 'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said. ( a beat ) I thought I'd better tell you.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders `we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.' What do you think would have happened? No different.
PAUL: Where has all our beer gone?
ZOZO: Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
PAUL: How much beer?
ZOZO: Many beers.
PAUL: I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: The police are very busy.
PAUL: I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: He did.
PAUL: "Well rewarded" Those were his words.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
PAUL: The front gate would be best, General. They could check all guests.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: I will see what I can do.
PAUL: I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
PAUL: I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
ENERAL BIZIMUNGU: He is staff?
BENEDICT: Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
PAUL: We, who is we?
BENEDICT: A delegation.
PAUL: A brief silence, then a Tutsi bank manager speaks.
BANKER: You have no right to charge us rent.
PAUL: Why not?
BANKER: This is no longer a hotel, it is a prison and you are profiteering from our misery.
ODETTE: That is not true.
TUTSI ACCUSER: Yes it is. He charges for food, for everything. Where is all this money going? We hear he has a deal with It is said that you work for the murderer George Rutagunda.
PAUL: I confess. ( a beat ) It's true I have a deal with General Bizimungu. He was just here. I worked out another money making scheme for him. New arrivals will be taxed at the gate.
JEAN BAPTISTE: You can't go to that place, they know what you are doing here.
PAUL: George will not hurt me, I am too profitable to him.
ODETTE: What if he is not there?
PAUL: As soon as the General left he came running back. ( mimics Gregoire ) Help me, sir, I have been possessed by a witch. ( Paul's own voice now ) A witch you say? ( mimics ) Yes, yes, I did not know I was in that room. The president's room, why would I be in the president's room? ( own voice ) Indeed, the General asked me the same. ( mimics ) Asked you what? ( own voice ) Does Gregoire think he is president now?
TATIANA: ( laughing ) Stop, stop, we will waken the children.
PAUL: Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
TATIANA: So where is the lamb?
PAUL: Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
TATIANA: What's the matter?
PAUL: We're running out of beer and other
TATIANA: The foreigners abandon us and you do inventory. You are so conscientious.
PAUL: I have to go out to get food.
TATIANA: Go out! Where?
PAUL: To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
TATIANA: No, no.
PAUL: I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
TATIANA: You cannot go alone.
PAUL: I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
GREGOIRE: Please, except my humblest apologies.
PAUL: Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
GREGOIRE: ( fearful ) Where are we going, sir?
PAUL: For supplies, you drive.
GREGOIRE: The fog is too heavy, sir.
PAUL: Just drive, Gregoire.
GREGOIRE: We should go back, sir.
PAUL: Nothing. He moves to the barrier, lifts the pole, places it on the ground, hurries back to the van.
PAUL: Let's go.
MILITIAMAN #1: What do you want?
PAUL: We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
MILITIAMAN #1: The commander is not here.

GEORGE: Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
PAUL: I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey. G
EORGE: Beer yes, but no whiskey.
PAUL: You have no whiskey?
GEORGE: No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
PAUL: What do you mean George?
GEORGE: Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
PAUL: ( incredulous ) ) You cannot kill them all.
GEORGE: Why not? We are half way there already.
PAUL: Let's go.
GEORGE: Take the river road back. It is clear.
PAUL: Are you sure this is the river road?
GREGOIRE: I saw the sign.
PAUL: Stop. You've driven off the road. You'll put us in the river.
PAUL: Go back! Go back!
PAUL: Tell no one what you saw, do you
P: PAUL watches. Tears stream from his eyes, the stream grows into a flood, he buries his face in his hands.
PAUL: That's a big one. ( pinches the thorn ) Here we go.
CHILDREN: Good evening, Papa.
PAUL: Roger, you have no greeting for me.

TATIANA: What was the bribe? What am I worth to you?
PAUL: It was substantial.
TATIANA: Tell me what it was.

TATIANA: What sort of car?
PAUL: What does it matter.
TATIANA: I want to know.
PAUL: A Volkswagen.
