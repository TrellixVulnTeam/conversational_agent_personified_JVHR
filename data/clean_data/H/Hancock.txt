HANCOCK: Written by Vincent Ngo & Vince Gilligan
MARY: The principal did'nothing. Like schoolyard terrorism is no worse than being tardy. What's the matter with education? Back when, you could go to school and learn about Betsy Ross and. mollusks and. not get stabbed on the way home.
FISH: How the fuck can I help you sir?
SUPERHERO: A room.
FISH: Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front. ( re: the check-in sheet ) And your John Hancock makes it sweet. The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles
HANCOCK: on the dotted line. Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's FISH ( CONT'D ) I don't take messages, I don't do favors, and I don't know you from Jack. You want sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra. Plunger's extra.
HANCOCK: I need quiet. Is it quiet?
FISH: Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public library to you? The girls work. Some of them scream, some of them moan.
HORUS: How's the eye?
AARON: Horus enters. Stands awkwardly before his son.
HORUS: It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it up with some make-up and you won't even know it's there.
AARON: Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly make-up on my face. Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.
HORUS: ( almost apologetically ) There'll always be people around who'll. exert force over those of us who just want to live in peace. Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts.
AARON: .after a good night sleep. The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT Horus backs his way out. Shuts the door. Mary's hand greets him from behind. It startles the man. He.tries to regroup.
HORUS: Mary inches closer - passion oozes from every pore. She nestles up against her husband. Horus stands uncoordinated, pressing his hands against her back. He is gentle, but as effective as an armless masturbator. Mary caresses his neck. Moves her lips to his ear, enraptured
BY: the moment. And out of nowhere.
MARY: ( DISAPPOINTED ) ( BEAT ) Coffee's by the door. S hakes his fists, mentally kicking himself in the face.
AARON: ( IRRITATED ) I don't need you walking me to school. Mary clasps her ears - deaf.
MARY: not listening ( in disbelief ) I got the only mother does this. in the world that I'm not lisMARY g. Lalalala..,
AARON: ( in disbelief ) I got the only mother does this. in the world that I'm not lisMARY g. Lalalala..,
CHSTICK: Horns stands over Roheim's slumpne ss. Removes a from his own pocket. handkerchief
HORUS: ( GENTLY ) He's done this before.
ROHEIM: ( dream state ) Roheim. Let's go home. Roheim stirs.
HORUS: Roheim. Let's go home. Roheim stirs.
ROHEIM: . bitch. From the dark recesses of sleep - he wakes. Straightens up. Slurps back his dignity.
HORUS: I just made the last run. He helps the old man to his feet.
ROHEIM: You're a good man.
HANCOCK: ( mumbling; rehearsing ) it's about responsibility. with what is empowered in you. to correct the ills of man. No foam. No gel. Just skin and the razor edge of his belt BUCKLE - it slices through stubble, clearing up a face that has yet to HANCOCK ( CONT'D ) ( AGAIN ) it's about responsibility. Hancock reaches into the cabinet below the sink - pulls out a BOTTLE of 409 all-purpose cleaner. On the tube, the commercial segues way into.
ROHEIM: I'll just play out the rest of this Eight He laps up the last drop. Reloads it with a couple of batteries from his jacket.
ROHEIM: Bastards. couldn't protect a pitcher of warm spit. couldn't find their asshole with common sense and a thumb.
TO: BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. Schoolyard activities abound. Buses, bouncing balls, and hoards of screaming little anti-christs.
I: Mary leads Aaron along the playground fence, the latter trying to pull ahead and away.
MARY: Will you slow down.
AARON: I know it. I know it.
MARY: I think I'm. slow down. I'm gaining weight. Honey, take a look at my waist.
AARON: Is my dress too tight?
MARY: Is my dress too tight?
AARON: What? Nothing. It's fine.
MARY: Really, my waist isn't too big?
AARON: What? Not here, mom.
MARY: All right, already. Two-thirty. You do n't leave the building till then. I'll be I know it, mom. Can I go now?
AARON: I know it, mom. Can I go now?
MARY: Give me a kiss, you snot.
AARON: ( there is no god ) He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary's smiling cheeks.
MARY: All right, mom. He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children.
AARON: All right, mom. He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children.
MARY: ( after him; in vain ) You want anything from the store? He's gone.
CLYDE: ( LOUD ) Longfella. Good to see you.
HORUS: Clyde shoves the remains of the paper at Horus - in his face.
CLYDE: Picked this up for you. ( pulls the paper back ) Say thanks.
HORUS: ( hands it over ) You're a good man.
CLYDE: ( hands it over ) You're a good man.
MARY: You're sweet, Nick. He cracks a wet smile. Mary, aware, unhands the artichoke. Moves CUT TO: EXT. STREET - DAY Mary moves through the street, embracing a grocery bag. She continues her way, purpose in every step. No window shopping bullshit for this woman - Mary's strong, beautiful. She crosses the street, her destination: CENTRAL FIDELITY BANK. A dark CHEVY eases pass Mary on this street, pulls to a stop. Mary continues forth, entering the bank.

No window shopping bullshit for this woman - Mary's strong, beautiful. She crosses the street, her destination: CENTRAL FIDELITY BANK. A dark CHEVY eases pass Mary on this street, pulls to a stop. Mary continues forth, entering the bank.
WOMAN: Hey, what's the idea? The man turns. Smiles. His smile fades, turning into a maniacal. grin. This man is TOM ( 35 ), as plainly evil as the eye can see.
TOM: You know what, you remind me of my Tom whips out a sawed-off SHOTGUN from his pants.
TOM: ( to Jerry #2 ) Thank you, Jerry. Tom is referring to Jerry's demonstration of the lotus Jerry does not respond.
JERRY #2: I'm stuck. Mary, amongst the crowd, watcheson withinterest.
TOM: ( to the crowd ) And while I take care of business, my associates will be making their rounds. The Jerrys leap into action - guns pointing. They rummage the helpless patrons for jewelry, cash and collectables.
MARY: ( UNINTIMIDATED ) I have no money.
JERRY #2: ( I wasn't born yesterday ) Come on, is. What the hell you doing in a bank if you.got no money?
MARY: I'm here to withdraw money. This stumps the brainless beast. And over by the teller, while he's stuffing her bag.
TOM: Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful. She's too scared for speech. But back on the bank floor.
JERRY #2: ( at her ring ) Give me that.
TOM: ( to the crowd ) No heroes! No heroes! Jerry #2 returns, bad news on his tongue.
JERRY #2: He flew! Fucking Fred flew!
TOM: Fuck! Fuck! A wave of SIRENS punctuate their state of "fuck." It crescendoes around the building.
JERRY #1: ( IMPRESSED ) Wow, S.W.A.T.
TOM: ( muttering; spelling the end ) I'm not going back. Mary, amongst the crowd, takes a glance at the CLOCK one CUT TO: INT. BANK DAY Time LAPSES. It's 2:30. Mary turns from the clock, concerned. She studies the situation, the robbers - an overall glumness tells the story. At the entrance - Tom. He looks desperate. Irrational. Ready to snap.
TED: ( YAWNING ) Time's running out, fellas. He turns to his sidekick, CHAD ( 25 ), a fellow cop. Chad's on the phone deliberating an important call.
CHAD: ( hands over the phone ) Ooh, one sec. ( to the bank ) Time's. all Hell's gonna break loose, ( to phone ) My koochie, woochie, oochie ooo. A BLAST rings out from Central Fidelity. Glass shatters from the entrance. A body, the security guard, tumbles out and onto the sidewalk. Blood and brain exits in OOZES where the bullet had entered - he's probably dead.

TOM: I want that car, Ted!
TED: Where's that car, Jesus!
CHAD: It's out getting your pizza.
TED: ( at the sky ) What the.
HANCOCK: ( GOD ) Everybody out, please. Bodies bang about, all moving for the door.
TOM: Stay away. Hancock does not respond.
HANCOCK: ( catching the renegade slug ) Why'd you go and do that for? Tom retrieves his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back, clutching his head. He bleeds.
TOM: Fuck. My shirt.
HANCOCK: ( steps forward ) Why don't we call it the day.
TOM: ( gun raised ) Don't. I told you. I'm not going back.
HANCOCK: ( IRRITATED ) If you're going to tease, cock the damn gun. Otherwise, spare me the wounded animal act of desperation. I don't got c, time for rhetoric and sympathy so. don't expect. dialogue and "come with me and you won't be hurt" bullshit. You walk out of here with me and your life is a violent storm. You will be hurt, you will be abused. whatever turns them on. Either way, your days are shit! Those are the realities, spelled out.
TOM: What's eating you, man?
HANCOCK: ( UPSET ) You got half the precinct out there, armed, trained to blow the tail off a sperm from a hundred yards. you're standing in here, cornered, three bullets left in that squirter of yours, if you're lucky, and you got one ear. I don't need the aggravation. I don't need this.
TOM: Man, you're jaded. I'm not asking for a ( MORE ) TOM ( CONT' D ) you don't got to shower me with respect. Just a little.. tenderness, is all. Have you no mercy, mister?
HANCOCK: ( he's had enough ) I'm all out. Let's go. And as he utters this, he approaches Tom.
TOM: ( HURT ) Fuck you. Close on his trigger finger. It tightens.
HANCOCK: INT. BANK - DAY On the bank floor, where a group of cops now huddle, we hear THREE SHOTS - from the safe.
NO!: INT. BANK - DAY On the bank floor, where a group of cops now huddle, we hear THREE SHOTS - from the safe.
MARY: Tell me. what happened?
AARON: ( about to break ) You were late.
MARY: I was held up.
AARON: The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit.
MARY: .at the bank. Honey, were they the same ones? Don't cry.
AARON: Get a grip, mom. They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the EXT. APARTMENT - DAY The door SLAMS to signify arrival. School books go flying. Mother and son march down the hallway. They are greeted by Horus, sleep still on his face.
HORUS: How was your day? Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel.
JUMPER': ( SELF-PITY ) People ignore me. From his vantage - a congregation of PEOPLE swarm below in his honor. A woman cradling a BABY watches from a building window across the street.
FIREMAN: Mr. Fisher.
SECRETARY: ( through her teeth ) You're not unattractive.
FIREMAN: Baldness is not fatal.
JUMPER: My wife ignores me.
FIREMAN: Your wife's a cunt, Mr. Fisher.
SECRETARY: We like you, Mr. Fisher. The girls acknowledge you, we all do.
JUMPER: The secretary SCREAMS. All attention shifts to the BUILDING across the street. The secretary points.

NEWS: . paramedics have taken the rescued tenants to County General for smoke inhalation but no serious injuries reported thanks to the superheroics of this mystery man.
HORUS: ( to Mary ) Mary blinks back her attention.
MARY: He's looking for answers. He's Upset.
HORUS: ( tapping the door ) Let me see your eye. ( to Mary ) I told him about the other cheek. Avoid confrontations. to turn the other .He did. He turned the other cheek and they punched it.
MARY: .He did. He turned the other cheek and they punched it.
HORUS: ( PLEADING ) You're late. I'll try again later. Horus finds his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her back to him. She's glued to the set.
MARY: You're late. I'll try again later. Horus finds his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her back to him. She's glued to the set.
HORUS ': How. what about you?
MARY: ( ALOOF ) Horus turns his focus to the TV - more Hancock FOOTAGE. He watches Mary.
HORUS: I. had no idea.
MARY: I. had no idea.
.HORUS: I. had no idea.
MARY: ( on the TV ) What could you do? Horns - hat in hand, goes to the door. He wants to stay.
HORUS: ( opens door ) Good thing he was there. I don't know what I'd do. if you. Mary does not hear him. until the door SHUTS behind her. She turns to face an empty room.
MARY: Coffee's by the. door.
VERONICA: ( a her voice trembles ) Oh god. The man surfaces from her cleavage for air, his face wet with sweat and saliva. He brushes his cape away from his arm. Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her breasts beckoning at ceiling. Quite abruptly, he lets her go. Rights his pants. Unlatches the window. She paws after him.
HANCOCK: ( DEJECTED ) 'Nothing. I'm sorry. And with that, he floats out into the night.
VERONICA: ( dazed; after him ) EXT. STREET - NIGHT Horus. His walk. Unaware of everything but the storm inside his He crosses an alley. A band of THUGS, neighborhood kids of malcontent, surprises him. And. versa. They recoil at his uniform, his gun. They quickly realize that he's rent-a-security. The leader speaks first - he's SCARPO ( 25 ), as tough as a steel- belted radial. The others regroup their DRUGS.
SCARPO: Horus keeps walking.
OTHERS: Ain't half the Man. Horus simply walks away.
HOODLUM: ( PSYCHOTIC ) Better yet, why don't I just take it. Hancock - enraged. In a caffeinated blink, he has the Hoodlum by the throat via one arm, the gun with the other.
HANCOCK: ( SUPER-PSYCHOTIC ) What are you thinking? The Hoodlum notices that he's dangling a foot off the ground - one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the swift jolt. The other sneaker teeters on his one foot. and falls to the ( fuck me ) What are you thinking?! Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS.
HOODLUM: ( fuck me ) What are you thinking?! Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS.
HANCOCK: What are you thinking?! Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS.
HOODLUM: ( with his mouth full ) Please, mister. I got a baby coming.., a wife. I got student loans. Hancock - intense. Is this getting through?
MARY: ( SURPRISED ) You're still up.
AARON: Can't sleep. He rolls over the sofa, next to his mother. They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the crashing Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this AARON ( CONT' D ) ( IMPRESSED ) That's him?
MARY: There's something about him. I don't A female REPORTER concludes the footage.
REPORTER: ( FAINTLY ) And so we ask. who is this man? Speculation abounds - government super- experiment, an aberration of nature, or extraterrestrial renegade? Who are you? Where are you now, superguy? Call me.
HANCOCK: ( MUTTERING ) What he's got to do. a man's got to do EXT. BAR - NIGHT Hancock stumbles out, incognito, frazzled under his guise. Up above, the sky - so dark under the storm clouds. We HEAR commotion in the side alley. And so does Hancock. He peers into the alley. There, by a lighted PHONE BOOTH, a WHORE is fending off a horny JOHN. Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his legs. He drops. SQUEALS like a little girl. The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt. He reaches for it.
WHORE: ( the sage ) You've been to Hell, it looks. And you're ( BEAT ) and in need. Hancock - his eyes agree. The Whore lifts her skirt, reaching into her panties. She takes out a MATCHBOOK. Hands it to him.
HANCOCK: ( GEENA ) ( correcting; vaGINA ) CUT TO: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT Aaron's room, his nightlight the only source of light. Mary sits on the bed, by her son.
WHORE: ( correcting; vaGINA ) CUT TO: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT Aaron's room, his nightlight the only source of light. Mary sits on the bed, by her son.
AARON: Just a quick one.
MARY: Just a quick one.
'AARON: Don't 3Â±119.
MARY: I want to.
AARON: EXT. SKY - NIGHT From the black night - a dark figure plummets, caroms off the side of a building, strikes the metal fire-escapes, crashing into the trash cans below. Hancock stumbles from the wreckage, the garbage. Falls. He leans against the building, glazed over with drunkenness. He turns to the only source of light that of a building across the street: KILLYBEGS TEXTILES, looming above the rest. Boarded- up windows indicate abandonment - an urban relic. He stares at the building - perhaps sparing more attention than we think it deserves.
MARY: "Once there was a way, to get back homeward. Once there was a way, to get back home."
AARON: Oh, mom.
MARY: Shut up.
MARY: "Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I will sing a lullaby."
ERLICK: He's not going anywhere.
SPENGLER: 'Less he can walk through wall.
ERLICK: Fuck. squeeze through brick.
PERCEVAL: ( just arriving ) Let's rock it up. They turn the corner, attack mode. Aaron, nowhere in sight. Just the brick wall and a trash can. They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler scratches his head. But'Perceval's no fool. He spots the trash He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They ATTACK. an empty can. No one inside. Nothing. That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron hovers - under Hancock's capable arm. In mid-air, they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY Mary stands at the designated pick-up spot, pacing like her bladder's going to break.
MARY: ( checking watch ) No. no. no!
HANCOCK: You smoke?
AARON: Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid. ( beat; takes a puff ) Smoke no evil. Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.
HANCOCK: Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid. ( beat; takes a puff ) Smoke no evil. Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.
AARON: Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just about all you need to know: a man's got to do what a man's got to do. ( beat; smokes ) I look at your face, the shiners. You took a shove and you let it go clean. Not good. That's a formula for future abuse. an invitation to the loser's dance. Letting it go. Walking away. ,( shakes head ) Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're running, looking for a place to hide.

AARON: What am I suppose to do?
HANCOCK: You do what is necessary.
AARON: I wanted. there were three of them.
HANCOCK: What is necessary.
AARON: ( thinking about it ) He gets away. Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.
HANCOCK: No. The fox gets his ass kicked and some. I mean ripped apart by the dogs, like cheap fabric.
AARON: What're you saying?
HANCOCK: But you know, when the last hound was through with him,-and he's walking away, he hears this noise. It's the fox and he's muttering something under his breath. words. The dog goes over. Gets up close. To hear what he's saying. You know what the fox's saying. just before he keels off? Aaron - negative.
AARON: No regrets. You make a decision and you stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And "no regrets." Aaron - submitting it to memory.
HANCOCK: No regrets. You make a decision and you stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And "no regrets." Aaron - submitting it to memory.
AARON: Why're you telling me all this?
HANCOCK: ( a beat to think ) Look at it this way. I got to do what I got to do.
DR. HOLE: at the Hole Institute, our experienced staff and cutting-edge technology means you need not spend another day in discomfort from hemorrhoidal flare-ups. Also, for anal fissures, warts, and secondary yeast infections, the institute is your complete rectal service clinic.
MARY: ( SAVIOR ) Are you OK?
HANCOCK: I'm sorry.
MARY: ( NERVOUS ) I came in to. hope you like chicken. Hancock nods, watching Mary as she retreats into the kitchen. He continues to stare - at Mrs. Longfellow, in frenetics, prepping for dinner. She catches him looking. looking surreal, this superman, there on her sofa. A calm, while they stare. And then.
MARY: AARON ( O.S. ) Horus enters from the hallway, disheveled from sleep. He does not see the superman on his sofa. He continues into the kitchen.
MARY: You know Hancock?
AARON: He comes for dinner. Close on Hancock. Close on Horus.
HANCOCK: Man of the house?
MARY: ( to Hancock ) Which piece would you like?
HANCOCK: Breasts, please. Horus, watching everything - Mary and her every blush.
AARON: You want milk?
HANCOCK: No. It gives me gas. Thank you. A beat - as everyone visualizes a superFART.
AARON: It makes mom fart, too. Mary CHOKES on her food. Drops her fork. She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the utensil - and finding difficulty. Hancock grabs the table, one arm. Lifts it off the carpet and above everyone's head. Mary, startled, impressed, all of the above. She picks up the fork.
HANCOCK: not about the labor. or the love of ( beat; we've heard this before ) .It's about responsibility. with what is empowered in you. The gift of might. Might to.do what? Exploitation, because you can? Or a different path. To purvey justice. To correct the ills of man. because I can. Faces of profound confusion - Mary and Aaron. But they are charmed, his words secondary to his charisma. Horus, the quiet observer, observes.
HORUS: ( clearing throat ) Oh, it's not like you. what you do or anything. A department store over on Horus is in the securities business.
MARY: Horus is in the securities business.
HORUS: I'm a security guard. I'm just.
MARY: It's a large department store, over a couple million in merchandise. stereos, jewelry. On three floors.
HORUS: It's a night job. I sit around.
HANCOCK: You're a security guard. You keep the state of things. It's a job. You do it.
AARON: On the right. He leaves to find bladder relief - leaving Horus to his family.
MARY: ( in a whisper ) Horus, what do I do?
HORUS: ( at his watch ) I need to get ready.
AARON: ( to Horus ) What do I do with him. when you're gone? I have to entertain this super. She doesn't finish her. A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the It comes from the bathroom - the sound of PISS, urine versus the surface tension.of water. LOUD. WET. A turgid firehose at full blast. The force of urination grips the room - as powerful as the penile mechanism from which it is generated. The toilet FLUSHES. Hancock returns to a'room of astonished faces - mouths agape.

HANCOCK: ( lost; sombre ) and you could see the flames, through the storm. I get there, the vessel's all over, spread across three miles of South Pacific. Bodies floating in the water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns out, the only one alive was the captain, up against a buoy. crying 'cause he didn't go down with his men. and he's got to live with it.
AARON: ( making a fist ) I wanted to kill him.
MARY: I want to deck him, just once. So bad I tense up. like I can't even move.
AARON: I want to deck him, just once. So bad I tense up. like I can't even move.
MARY: ( to Hancock ) He comes home crying.
AARON: Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off.
HANCOCK: ( REACTS ) No. there's no shame in it. The crying. It's relief. ( to Mary ) we're older and we don't remember when. we go, "God, when was the last time?" Maybe it's me. It's more an effort, now. Takes more pain. more blood. Like it's, do you have the time anymore? Even to look back and recall a moving experience. To be moved.
HORUS: Oh, I. you don't have to leave. I don't want to interfere. I have work.
MARY: ( the original sin ) Oh, I forgot to make coffee. She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.
HORUS: It's all right, Mary. I'm late.
MARY: No, I'll make it right now.
HORUS: I don't have time. I'll grab some on the way. Thanks. Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free.
HANCOCK: No, I need to go. ( at' Mary and only Mary ) The last time I had a meal. an evening like this, I was. it was too long ago. I appreciate your kindness.
MARY: ( AWKWARD ) Please. you're welcome, here. Anytime. Horus watches everything - watching her chest heave under Hancock's every word, watching his wife slip away.
HANCOCK: Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I'll drop by after school. See how you're ( SMILES ) Horus watches this - his son slipping away. The two men leave, Hancock ushering Horus out first. Mary closes the door behind them. Leans against the door and EXHALES - a sign of relief, of despair, or, of a heart raging We just .don't know.
AARON: ( SMILES ) Horus watches this - his son slipping away. The two men leave, Hancock ushering Horus out first. Mary closes the door behind them. Leans against the door and EXHALES - a sign of relief, of despair, or, of a heart raging We just .don't know.
HORUS: ( POINTING ) I'm this way. Hancock points the opposite way.
HANCOCK: Need a lift?
HORUS: It's a short walk. An awkward beat while they stare at each other. . until finally, they go their separate ways - Horus via walk and Hancock, with effortless grace,, via flight. From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge into the blackness. A look of dread squats on his face.

ADAMS: ( god, I'm funny ) Observe anything worth recording, lately?
HORUS: You know. things are slow.
RUTGER: Not for Samsone Electronics on fifth. Got hit on Thursday.
ADAMS: The guard, he was cut-up like a piece of Anything go wrong, you make sure you notify us, the authorities. No heroics without a license. You know the Horus - he knows the procedure.

RUTGER: Of course. Holly returns with the coffee. Hands it to Horus - free of charge. From the back, Soon-yi intervenes.
HOLLY: Oh, I thought.
MARY: What're you doing? She's taken by this scene.
AARON: ( releases fist ) Mary goes over to the bed. Sits.
MARY: About him?
AARON: No. Not really. Are you?
MARY: They're lying through their collective teeth.
AARON: Me neither. I was thinking.., about Go to sleep. You know what dad says. Tomorrow always feels better.
MARY: Go to sleep. You know what dad says. Tomorrow always feels better.
AARON: I know, mom. after a good night sleep. He says that but he's the one working every night. Does that mean he never feels better? He's always feeling ( AMUSED ) Go to bed, anyway. She tucks him-in.. Turns off the lamp. And as she's out the She turns.
MARY: ( AMUSED ) Go to bed, anyway. She tucks him-in.. Turns off the lamp. And as she's out the She turns.
AARON: She turns.
NEWS: ( re: Hancock ) .the trains seemed imminently bound for a catastrophic collision when this. this superguy.
ROHEIM: ( IMPRESSED ) Man. I bet he gets laid. Horus - he looks terrible.
ROHEIM: He snaps out of it.
HORUS: ( without looking ) Another dream?'
ROHEIM: I was talking again, huh?
ROHEIM: . that look on her face, you know the look, when she's almost there. makes you feel like a man.
HORUS: ( CONTINUING ) Come on.
ROHEIM: ( CONTINUING ) Come on.
HORUS: Come on.
ROHEIM: ( gets up ) Walk with me.
MARY: Have a good one.
AARON: I got to do what I got to do. She watches him go -curious.
ROHEIM: ( POST-GULP ) This stuff's going to kill me. He gives Horus a glance. Takes another swig.
HORUS: Sure you do. You disapprove and yet you allow me to drink. to poison myself. Your friend. Without a word of caution. Not a word. Just take it. you take You're afraid to offend. You don't want to be abrasive. Provocative. ( beat; as'Horus squirms ) So you suppress. Do nothing. Take it. Roheim takes another gulp.

ROHEIM: You're afraid to offend. You don't want to be abrasive. Provocative. ( beat; as'Horus squirms ) So you suppress. Do nothing. Take it. Roheim takes another gulp.
HORUS: ( pulling teeth ) You shouldn't drink.
ROHEIM: My wife. She left a bad taste in my mouth. I drink to kill-the taste. Horus has no response to this.
HANCOCK: ( nothing happened ) How are you? In unison, they turn to the UPS vehicle - a .mangled heap of steel, STEAM billowing from its ruptured radiator. Hancock shrugs a smiles.
HORUS: ( burning. ) Clyde. Can I talk to you for just a brief ( YAWNING ) Not now, Longfella. I'm all blocked up. Clyde heads inside - with the sports page.. He FARTS as he goes ( EXTINGUISHED ) EXT. STREET - DAY Along a street somewhere who cares - Hancock and Mary - in a cool stroll. Mary holds his trenchcoat, surveying the damage.
CLYDE: ( YAWNING ) Not now, Longfella. I'm all blocked up. Clyde heads inside - with the sports page.. He FARTS as he goes ( EXTINGUISHED ) EXT. STREET - DAY Along a street somewhere who cares - Hancock and Mary - in a cool stroll. Mary holds his trenchcoat, surveying the damage.
HORUS: ( EXTINGUISHED ) EXT. STREET - DAY Along a street somewhere who cares - Hancock and Mary - in a cool stroll. Mary holds his trenchcoat, surveying the damage.
MARY: What were you doing in the street? ( the trenchcoat ) You ripped it pretty good.
HANCOCK: didn't see it coming. left myself It'll be all right.
MARY: It'll be all right.
HANCOCK: All right?
MARY: It's just the seams. I can sew it back.
HANCOCK: ( the trenchcoat ) This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good care of it.
MARY: ( the trenchcoat ) This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good care of it.
HANCOCK: You'll sew -it?
MARY: Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for you, all right? Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one.
( CONTINUING}: Are you okay? No reply. He stares at her - simply.
MARY: ( like a little girl ) Let's see.
HANCOCK: You have to be quick.
MARY: Come on, I want to see.
HANCOCK: If you blink, you'll miss it. Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into moisture. It showers into his open hands. Mary reaches for it. Too late.
MARY: I saw it, right? A little cloud. She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains. And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain. Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand touches his. He stares down at her hand. at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls her hand away.
HANCOCK: I'm sorry.
MARY: I'm sorry.
HANCOCK: I'm sorry.
MARY: ( into his eyes ) It's not your fault.
HANCOCK: I've been tired, lately.
MARY: You should slow down. Rest.
HANCOCK: -So people tell me.
MARY: ( heat; upon some thought ) It must be hard.
HANCOCK: To always do right. do good when all you want to do is rest.
MARY: To always do right. do good when all you want to do is rest.
HANCOCK: It's harder to not do anything. What am I? It's not for me. It's for. it is about people. Rest? When there is despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am relief. You know that instant, that split instant of time when you realize that the nightmare. the totality of fear itself. that it's all been a bad dream? That it's safe? That is relief. The infant in my arms. to the hysterical mother. When you can see her face, what's rest? It is self-indulgence. Mary - in some advance stage of "wow."
MARY: Where. who are you?
HANCOCK: It's not important who I am, Mary. Or what. where I'm from. It doesn't matter. I'm a man. I am every man.
MARY: ( sizing up his words ) You probably get a lot of practice explaining yourself, on account of who you are and what you do.
HANCOCK: Why. do you say that?
MARY: It's like, everything you say sounds. so perfect. Like you rehearse them so they'll be that way. I mean, not to say that it's insincere.
HANCOCK: ( pulling teeth ) Mary allows the moment to sink in.
MARY: So, you never answered. Back there. what were you doing in the middle of the ( THINKS ) I was lost.
HANCOCK: ( THINKS ) I was lost.
AARON: ( HANCOCK ) " before long, you're running, looking for a place to hide."
PERCEVAL: Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed my hair. Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their eyes are of disbelief.
SPENGLER: Kick his ass, Percy.
ERLICK: ( OVERLAPPING ) Do him, Percy. He's your woman.
PERCEVAL: Let's go. Let's have it. While we're still kids. Nothing from Aaron - just a lot of balls.
ERLICK: He's yours.
SPENGLER: Save some for us. Someone blinks - and Aaron finds himself on the dirt, supine. Perceval looms over him, silhouetted against the sky. He reaches for his zipper, doing that Perceval-thing. A look of recognition in Aaron's eyes - it's going to rain soon. He reacts with knee-jerk reflects, administering a swift kick into Perceval's peeing apparatus. A faint SQUEAL eructs from the fellow's mouth. He drops like a wet tea bag. Erlick. Spengler. Shock. Disbelief. Aaron gets to his feet, ready to book. but he doesn't. He stays.
ERLICK: What's he doing?
SPENGLER: Kick his ass, Percy. Aaron stares at them, behind the fence. Then down at Perceval fetal position, mouth agape. Aaron reaches for his zipper ZIP, revenge presents itself.
ERLICK: That's cold.
SPENGLER: Kill him, Percy. Aaron cranes himself over Perceval's face, over his open oral orifice. Contemplates his target. Aaron - to pee or not to pee. ZIP. He closes his fly. Steps away.
AARON: ( to the boys ) Don't mess with me. He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline taking him away.
MARY: You're still up? She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious.
HORUS: Just get in? Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic attire. She nods affirmatively.
MARY: Nick's market. Are you sick?
HORUS: I can't sleep. She goes to the bed. Palms his forehead with her right. Palms her own with the left, as reference. Horus tilts his head away from her hand.
MARY: You want some milk? I'll heat it up for you, how about that?
HORUS: No thank you.
MARY: Yes, he is. He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues dressing - oblivious.
HORUS: He'll take him home?
MARY: What do we know about this man? The papers. they don't have all the facts about him.
HORUS: What do we know about this man? The papers. they don't have all the facts about him.
MARY: What facts? He's not a hero.
HORUS: Yes. A hero. I know that.
MARY: Aaron likes him.
HORUS: ( TIMID ) I know that maybe, I've been neglectful. that I haven't been Mary does not hear him. She's at the mirror, fixing her hair.
LIPSTICK ): Are you going somewhere?
MARY: No. I have to start on dinner. So how about that glass of milk? Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.
AARON: .o his mouth was. open and he just stared up at me, it hurt that bad. And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair - a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned.
MARY: All right, already. How's your mouth?
AARON: It doesn't hurt, I told you.
HORUS: ( FINALLY ) Aaron, tomorrow.
AARON: ( to Mary; oblivious ) He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up I thought maybe you'd like it if I pick you.
HORUS: I thought maybe you'd like it if I pick you.
AARON: God, my friends will freak. Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard.
MARY: Hold still.
AARON: I like it long.
MARY: Shut up.
AARON: it's almost eight. Dad's late.
MARY: She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into the stairway outside. There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way up. Mary sees him. and they look at each other.
AARON: like this? ( holds up hand ) How do you make a fist?
MARY: ( grabs his head ) Aaron, hold it. Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes. So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and bones. It SNARLS at Aaron. Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't let go of them. Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in MARY ( CONT'D ) The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it.
( CONTINUING: ) turn. Hancock, it's yo ur
HANCOCK: Your hair. Come on, have a seat.
MARY: Your hair. Come on, have a seat.
AARON: Mom's going butcher your hair.
MARY: Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her, Hancock shrugs a "what can I do."
AARON: Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her, Hancock shrugs a "what can I do."
MARY: There. my hero. He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.
HANCOCK: Nice. Thank you. Mary - peripatetic, putting away things.
MARY: I started out just trimming for Horus. Here and there. He had to look just right for the academy, says his father, a police captain there. in Philly. When we moved here, I pretty much took over as the resident barber. You know, to save some money.
HANCOCK: He was in the-police academy? A pause.
MARY: His father's idea. Not his. He went through it anyway, like he had something to prove. the validation of his ( BEAT ) It tpok everything out of him. He didn't talk for days after he was cut. He took it real hard. I mean, still, he's not. I mean,, he's still. ( edits herself ) .it was a difficult time for hi.. Me. I understand that I'm not intolerant of it, the working-through process. It's just that, sometimes. ( at Hancock ) sometimes, I need his strength. I miss. the strength.
HANCOCK: Is that what you want?
MARY: What you need?
HANCOCK: What you need?
MARY: The hair. I need to.
HANCOCK: ( BEAT ) You ever been down the boardwalk, at Why. what for? They're eye to eye. Close.
MARY: ( BEAT ) You ever been down the boardwalk, at Why. what for? They're eye to eye. Close.
HANCOCK: ( BEAT ) You ever been down the boardwalk, at Why. what for? They're eye to eye. Close.
MARY: Why. what for? They're eye to eye. Close.
MARY: Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!
AARON: my mouth. It's starting to swell. I think he loosened a tooth. Mary - maternal duty calls.
MARY: All right. Go to your room. I'll get the ice pack. Aaron exits. Mary exits. Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for the front door. Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him.
HANCOCK: It's getting late.
MARY: I'm sorry.
HANCOCK: I'm going to take a walk.
MARY: Really? On the boardwalk?
HANCOCK: AARON ( O.S. ) I'm sorry. She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought.
MARY: I'm sorry. She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought.
HANCOCK: ( FINALLY ) Good night, Mary.
MARY: Good night.
MAN: I wear dresses. How about you?
HANCOCK: ( considers; nah ) Get lost. The warning comes across quite well - the man exits. Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door.
GINA: ( to bar fly ) Meet you outside. The El Camino, right? The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face in her hands, studies him.
HANCOCK: But you're still here. She rises. And as she makes for the exit.
GINA: But you're still here. She rises. And as she makes for the exit.
HORUS: Dear God. Horus catches him.
HORUS: Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to nurse' the wounds.
ROHEIM: Figured I can get you by the front. but you weren't there.
HORUS: ( dabbing the torn lip ) Who. what happened?
ROHEIM: They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and his boys. They were waiting on me. Returns to get more clean towels. And comes back.
HORUS: Why didn't you come through the back. standing out there in the dark?
ROHEIM: -Couldn't find my keys. Must've dropped them'in the fight. ( feels his lip ) He works himself off the chair. Heads inside the bathroom.
HORUS: What're you doing?
ROHEIM: ( into the mirror ) the old man Look at what they did.. gave a fat lip to match his big mouth. I'm for ( FRUSTRATION ) Sit down Could you knock it off, please. so I can clean the cuts. He leads the old wretch back to the chair.
HORUS: ( FRUSTRATION ) Sit down Could you knock it off, please. so I can clean the cuts. He leads the old wretch back to the chair.
ROHEIM: I'm a waste of time.
HORUS: I'm too old for this.
ROHEIM: I'm too old for this.
HORUS: You're not old.
ROHEIM: What am I. I'm biologically challenged. Any way you look, I'm a waste of effort.
I: Use to be, I blame the job. The job. think, bullshit job. Not right for a man. "To observe and record." I say, what a t's for the hell is DIo nly dogs. They got a d o o gs in t g g hisn reason we're he d re, we don't shit on the Horus looks away. Doesn't want to hear it.
HANCOCK: got to do what you got to do. He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other hand. We sense a decision brewing.
HANCOCK: I know you're up, Mary. I know you can hear me. Please meet me on the boardwalk tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock. It's important that I talk to y ou, then.
ROHEIM: They're going to can me.
HORUS: No one's canning anyone. No one saw us. watch your step. leave.
ROHEIM: Should be an extra key over the door.
AARON: The toast's burnt.
MARY: Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox.
AARON: We're late. you forgot the corn chips. Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down. and all over the place.
MARY: Eat. and we'll go. ( checks her watch ) Where's your father? She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair.
AARON: You forgot the corn. ( the comb snags ) . ouch!
MARY: I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll be home before we leave. I'm sorry.
AARON: You having your period, mom? She responds with a brisk slap to the head. SMACK.
ROHEIM: The two pause. Remove their shoes. Proceed into bedroom.
HORUS: You're going to be okay?
ROHEIM: I don't know. You might have solo act tomorrow night.
HORUS: Get some sleep.
ROHEIM: You're a good man, Horus.
HORUS: ( washing over it ) I have to get home, now. I'll call. Roheim grabs on to his sleeve.
ROHEIM: You know what Olga said before she walked out on me? Her last words to me. She turned at the front door. Looked around the room and she says, "keep it clean." That's it, can you believe it? Then out the door.
CLYDE: The box scores are waiting and I got an inch of meat sticking out of my ass. Make it snappy.
HORUS: ( loosing his voice ) I'd like my sports page, please.
CLYDE: You what?
HORUS: I want you to stop taking my sports page.
CLYDE: All right. Clyde closes the door. Horus - thunderstruck. He stutter-steps. KNOCKS.
HORUS: ( INTERRUPTS ) I want today's sports page.
CLYDE: You what?
HORUS: That there. my sports page.
CLYDE: What's gotten in to you? All of a sudden? You don't even like football. Horus does.not budge.
HORUS: No. I would like my sports page now. After I finish.
CLYDE: No. I would like my sports page now. After I finish.
HORUS: No. I would like my sports page now. After I finish.
CLYDE: After I finish.
HORUS: I'd prefer it now.
CLYDE: What's eating you, Longfella? You crazy? Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm a kamikaze move, indeed.
AARON: Are you all right, mom?
MARY: ( DISTRACTED ) Yeah. why?
AARON: You're acting weird.
MARY: ( didn't hear ) I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think it's time for your nap. Aaron leaves. Pensive, Mary begins her walk. to the boardwalk.
AARON: I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think it's time for your nap. Aaron leaves. Pensive, Mary begins her walk. to the boardwalk.
HORUS: A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY The ocean RAGES against the shore, in the distance and at some muffled volume. Up against the railing leans Hancock, and the remains of a cigarette. His hair drips of salt water - he's been here a while, one would suspect.
HORUS: The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance.
RUDENESS ): EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY Mary stands there on the boardwalk, the bag in her arms. It's cold this morning. A little wind has picked up. And the clouds - they're alive, restless. She finds Hancock, staring at her, waiting for. her.
HANCOCK: ( EMBARRASSED ) Thank you for being here.
MARY: Is everything all right?
U: MARY ( CONT' D ) ( CONCERNED ) What's wrong?
HANCOCK: ( constipated; following some
THOUGHT ): It's cold. Mary and Hancock - we notice, they look good together.
MARY: Tell me what's wrong. He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into Look out there and what do you see, Mary?
HANCOCK: Look out there and what do you see, Mary?
MARY: ( PERPLEXED ) Nothing. I don't know. I don't see see it,can Y nu? ( beat; holding on to a thread ) And that's good, not seeing. But for me, I've seen it. It's where I'm from. out Please, Hancock. What are you talking about? What's out there?
HANCOCK: see it,can Y nu? ( beat; holding on to a thread ) And that's good, not seeing. But for me, I've seen it. It's where I'm from. out Please, Hancock. What are you talking about? What's out there?
MARY: Please, Hancock. What are you talking about? What's out there?
HANCOCK: ( beat; at Mary ) You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you. He'll say: "you do what you have to do." Or what? You let the next guy do it for you, if you don't. if you can't. ( losing it ) And. but. If I can't, then who?
MARY: Hancock. what.
HANCOCK: I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll break. I need to get away. Get away to where? I don't know. ( at Mary ) I need your help.
MARY: Me? What can I do? ( she's helpless ) What do you want me to do?
HANCOCK: I want you to save me.
MARY: Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her. Their lips lock, twisted and entwined. until Mary, composing her senses, pulls away.
HANCOCK: ( DESPERATE ) Save me.
MARY: I can't.
HANCOCK: You can. ( the hard sell )
AND: Mary,-I'll take you away. And Aaron. what. I'll quit. Get a real job. An apartment. I'll flip burgers. I don't know what I'm doing. what I'm saying ( OVERLAPPING ) I'm married. A pause.
MARY: ( OVERLAPPING ) I'm married. A pause.
HANCOCK: To whom?
MARY: I love him. The death blow.
HANCOCK: ( turns from her ) I love him. I'm sorry. One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel. Mary wants to console. but what can she do?
MARY: I love him. I'm sorry. One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel. Mary wants to console. but what can she do?
HANCOCK: I'm cold. Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat.
MARY: I'm sorry.
THEM: ( MOCKINGLY ) "Don't mess with me." They leave - laughing.
MARY: CUT TO: EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY The school front. KIDS swarm into the streets, freshly released from captivity. And there amidst bedlam - Aaron, roughed-up and soiled in disgrace. He moves to the curb, waiting for someone to take him away. No Hancock, anywhere. Aaron waits, hopeful.
SUE: ( so innocent, her voice ) Hymie. Come down, Hymie. She catches Hancock, Mr..Superhero who can fly, stumbling by.
REED: What do we have here? A piece of shit. A slow look of recognition seizes his face - this is that Hancock stares at him.
HANCOCK: ( HUMORLESS ) Fuck off. He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly.
A: Aaron. Walking home. Dejected. His eyes catch a glimpse of particular pedestrian down the street - Hancock. He gives chase. and confronts him, out of breath.
AARON: ( a slight smile ) ( turning; drunk ) What're you doing here?
HANCOCK: ( turning; drunk ) What're you doing here?
AARON: ( the smile fades ) I saw you walking. Where were you today? You said you'd. be there. Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame.
HANCOCK: I don't know what you're talking about.
AARON: Where are you going? Can I go?
HANCOCK: You don't want to go where I'm going.
AARON: Those assholes got me in the bathroom, ( trying to hold on ) and you said you'd pick me up at Hancock turns. He's upset now.
HANCOCK: Aaron recoils.
HORUS: ( BOOZED ) Joey studies him. He takes a mug and begins to fill it.
JOEY: ( not in my place ) Bathroom's closed. Horus politely stands'- teeters a bit.
HORUS: How much.
JOEY: ( SARCASM ) Let's see. that's one beer. Tell you what. I'll take care of this one.
HORUS: Thank you.
JOEY: The register ain't open yet, anyhow. Horus doesn't hear him. He's already on the move, making a dash for the door. But too late - he VOMITS at the front entrance.
GINA: I've been waiting. They stare for one horny beat. Hancock moves into her. Buries his head into her bosoms, looking for solace. She takes him in, very maternal this Gina.
GINA: Come on, baby. Relax.
HANCOCK: I can't.
GINA: You can. The phone begins to RING - but they're busy.
HANCOCK: I can't.
GINA: Let it go, baby. Just let it.
HANCOCK: ( in tears ) I can't. His arm rips through the glass.
GINA: . go.
HANCOCK: I can't!
GINA: Don't give up, now. He lets her down. Tears out of the booth. Finds the sky.
HORUS: ( on the ground; prone ) Son. Go to your room. Struggles to his knees.
MARY: What happened toyou?
AARON: Dad, are you wasted?
MARY: Where. Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to your room.
AARON: He is wasted. Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa. When Mary tries to assist, he waves her away.
HORUS: Aaron. Go to your room.
AARON: But dad.
MARY: ( AUTHORITY ) Aaron obliges, at reluctant pace.
HORUS: Don't "Horus Longfellow" me, Mary. I'm not your child. I'm your husband.
MARY: Horus, what're you talking about? ( re: bruises ) Who did this to your face? Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.
HORUS: ( OBLIVIOUS ) But you didn't know-about me. Mary knows where this is headed.
MARY: Why do you say that?
HORUS: Because I let you down.
MARY: ( ballistic ) L are. Did You're a fool, that's what you you think I was completely blind when I married you? Something cuts at your masculine ego and it's the pressure. the standard's unreasonable. The woman, she wants me to part oceans. That's the kind of bull shit's made of. I went w through it.,I was there when the hurt came, when the academy said no. I there. And when you felt like hiding. from me and your ownforward. taking Rent job, I stepped It was you, Horus Longfellow. otile. I didn't take the love away. Horus stands there - tears, almost. He takes to his security retrieving his U-Rent Security Jacket. He grabs hat. Straightens his hair. Puts it on.

HANCOCK: ( losing it ) I need a cigarette, goddamn it! He storms from the bed. Heads for the bathroom.
VOICE: I don't smoke. What's wrong with you? She rises after him and into view - it's no other than the TV reporter, in the flesh. She bounces over to the bathroom, as the door SLAMS shut.
REPORTER: What're you doing?
R: He washes his face.
HOODLUM: Scream and I blow. ( not you again! ) oh shit. Hancock in a foul mood. He brushes the Hoodlum away, sending flesh and bone against the opposite wall. SNAP goes the landing. The Hoodlum. Dead. Hancock - realization. He hastens to the body. limp. broken.

MARY: ( she's white ) What're you doing? Hancock closes in. Corners her.
HANCOCK: It's the haircut, Mary. ( strikes his head ) I'm pissed! Out of nowhere - Aaron charges the caped psychotic. He trampolines on Hancock's back, trying to saddle him.
AARON: Don't you fucking touch her! Mary SCREAMS. Hancock cringes, says.
HANCOCK: Shut your mouth. He swats the kid off his back.
AARON: Don't touch her you bastard!
HANCOCK: You're getting on my nerves.

AARON: No! Mom!
MARY: Stay back, Aaron! Hancock takes her away - like booty. Aaron dangles from his cape, trying to save his mother.. In vain. The superhero springs into the night - with his woman.

HORUS: ( COP ) I saw four. Presumably armed. Only other way out is through the back. The cops trade laughs.
RUTGERS: Take a hike, Longfella. Get back in your hole and watch the law kick some ass. Horus, reluctant, returns inside his building. Rutgers moves to work the speakers - his action preempted by the other COPS.
COP #1: We got something big going down.
ADAMS: ( at the computer ) Killybegs Textiles. The Cap sounds like he's chewing the rag.
RUTGERS: Fuck, what do we do with this?

SCARPO: Take the show upstairs.
SCARPO: ( no answer ) Fuck me. He drops his loot. Heads for the second floor, cocking his gun.
REPORTER: again, we believe that this is a hostage situation. Officials refuse to comment but we believe Hancock has abducted a woman, the identity of whom we do not yet know. Horus - a look of horror on his face.
HORUS: He's off, slowing to a ginger descent at the stairs. Makes his way down to the second floor. where he is greeted by a gun NOZZLE, pressed against his temple.
SCARPO: You're starting to piss me off. He pushes Horus down the remaining steps.
SCARPO: Your move. Horus uncoils an accurate kick to Scarpo's groin. Scarpo - a dumbfounded look entwined in pain. He drops. strength from god knows where. g Takes dead aim with a tremblin BANG. Horus grimaces. Scarpo drops. .45 ( knocked from Roheim steps forward from the darkness, the Horus, earlier ) smoking in his hand. Did I get him? Horus. Roheim. They look at Scarpo.
HORUS: What're you doing here. ROHEIM ed Mary called earlier. She was worri about you.
HORUS: EXT. SHEEPSHEAD BAY - NIGHT with gloom. Those clouds that shroud the sky a CRACKLE of lightning echoes through the They begin to surge neighborhood. And the rain begins to pour.
TED: Let the lady go, Hancock. Or all hell's going to break loose.
RUTGERS: ( to Adams ) Does he know anything else?
MARY: But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his hand down her back and between her buttocks.
HANCOCK: A sudden burst of anger seizes Mary. She SCREAMS. STRIKES Hancock across the face.
MARY: He tears himself away. Disgusted. Tortured.
NO!: He tears himself away. Disgusted. Tortured.
HANCOCK: ( a desperate child ) Help me.
HANCOCK: Make it go away, Mary. Mary huddles against the wall..She watches on, watching him TED ( 0. S ) You are surrounded. There's no way out of this one. NO WAY OUT! Hancock on his knees, tears bubbling inside. He shakes it off.
HANCOCK: No. do what I got to do. He unloads a PUNCH. PUNCTURES brick. Clear through.
C: EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILE - NIGHT the other side. The authorities react. They right their Ted Brock - a picture of grim impatience, breathing hard.
TED: I want his balls in a jar. Chad. The others. They take a good look at him.
MARY: I'm cold.. Hancock does not respond.
MARY: ( CONTINUING ) and the responsibility. The duty. You can't shrug it off.
TED: Where the fuck is Chopper Three?
CHAD: ( CONCERNED ) This is a hostage situation, Cap. We've got a woman in there.
TED: Fuck the woman, this is Armageddon. I want that bastard in a body bag. Ted waves a "go-when-ready" sign. The Rifleman steadies his high- powered weapon. FIRES.
HANCOCK: Go away! Go. Away. The authorities - they pause, startled. They open FIRE. Cops. S.W.A.T. teams. Their cousins. Bullets ZIP through the air and with dead accuracy. Hundreds of shells strike Hancock - the target. They PING off his armor of He stares at them all, invincible.
AARON: Let me go you bastard.
OFFICER: Let go, you little asabite. Aaron spots Horus in the hallway.
AARON: He breaks loose - running into his father's arms, crying.
OFFICER: Mr. Longfellow.
OFFICER: There's not much you can do. We've got every man out there, already. I suggest you take your son some place safe. Let us do our jobs.
HORUS: ( on the TV ) I'm sorry, dad. I'm sorry.
AARON: I'm sorry, dad. I'm sorry.
OFFICER: ( dreading it ) I have to go. they need me. He exits. Roheim enters, out of breath. He notices the nasty, gaping hole in the kitchen.
HORUS: He's got Mary, Roheim. ( blank; uncertain ) I got to get her.
ROHEIM: What do you mean, you got to get her?
HORUS: I got to do what I got to do. Aaron stares up at his father - "did he just say that?"
AARON: Damn right, dad. We got to get her. Horus at the screen - oblivious. "What can I do?"
ROHEIM: Brain damage runs in this family or Aaron senses his father's state of overwhelmness.
AARON: Dad. You ever hear about the fox and the EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT A HELICOPTER ( Chopper Three ) has since joined the picture of CHAOS. A strobe light cuts through the darkness and rain, zeroed in on Hancock. A machine GUN mounted inside opens FIRE - a wave of bullets ricochet off the superhero with no effect. Cops and S.W.A.T. teams continue their assault - it's the only thing they can do, and it's worthless. And on that note, Hancock retaliates - with a vengeance. First to go is the helicopter. He slices through the air and RIPS the vehicle in half. An EXPLOSION punctuates its demise - sending the spinning PROPELLER into wild trajectory. It crashes into a cluster of Cops - heads are severed, sent flying.
HANCOCK: Go away!
HORUS: Jesus, Aaron. I don't want you to be ( at the mayhem ) I need a drink. Aaron, staring at the massacre - a HEAD rolls pass him. It looks pale but well-fed, healthy. It Ted's. Aaron ducks into his father's chest.
ROHEIM: ( at the mayhem ) I need a drink. Aaron, staring at the massacre - a HEAD rolls pass him. It looks pale but well-fed, healthy. It Ted's. Aaron ducks into his father's chest.
MARY: What have you dome?
HANCOCK: I made them go away.
MARY: ( HORROR ) ( holding his head ) The noise.
HANCOCK: ( holding his head ) The noise.
MARY: Please, Hancock. Don't hurt him. ( grabs him ) It'll never go away. Hancock responds to "it."
HANCOCK: Please, Hancock. Don't hurt him. ( grabs him ) It'll never go away. Hancock responds to "it."
MARY: Please, Hancock. Don't hurt him. ( grabs him ) It'll never go away. Hancock responds to "it."
HANCOCK: ( DESPAIR ) I can't.
HANCOCK: You ready to rock it up? Horus runs - he runs for an overturned S.W.A.T. VAN. Hancock follows, toying with the man. Horus disappears inside.
HORUS: Fuck you. Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable. He GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there's no Horus. Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall loose, sending it crashing down.., on Hancock. CRUNCH, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does not subdue him. He shakes off the dirt. Finds Horus down the Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way. He gets there, over Horus - grabbing him by the collar. With a swift flick, he sends the family man flying. THUD as his body careens off the Killybegs wall. He drops to the asphalt below. Horus - in pain, something broken possibly.
HANCOCK: ( COOL ) No mercy. He takes aim.
NO!: Mary SCREAMS in the background. Horns. Hancock. They turn to witness the de-physicalization of Killybegs Textile. they begin to crumble, weakened by the wear Bricks. beams. and tear of recent artillery. Mary braces herself as the floor beneath begins to give. It slips. she SCREAMS. and collapses, taking the rest of the building with it. A CRASH, followed by a cloud of billowing smoke. Mary is no more.
HORUS: Aaron. Roheim. In disbelief.
MARY!: Aaron. Roheim. In disbelief.
AARON: ( BLANKLY ) Horus, he struggles to his feet. Pushes past Hancock, limping over to the building that once was.
HORUS: Hancock - not a word. He stands in comatose silence, looking Horus charges the building in possessed hysterics, trying to excavate his wife - one brick at a time. Roheim meets him there, in an effort to console.
MARY!: Hancock - not a word. He stands in comatose silence, looking Horus charges the building in possessed hysterics, trying to excavate his wife - one brick at a time. Roheim meets him there, in an effort to console.
