DR. FELL: Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's first sonnet. Do you know it, Professor Sogliato? I believe it's worth your time: Listen to the way he makes an instrument of the Italian vernacular, which he called the vulgari eloquentia the eloquent voice of the people: Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core in mano, e ne la braccia avea/Madonna involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la svegliava a d'esto ardeno/Lei paventosa umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea paingendo. If Dante had written to a Cavalcanti, it would, of course, have been to Andrea, the most literary of his .why do you want this job?
SOGLIATO: .why do you want this job?
