RAZOR: That's right, this IS a payphone.
BLADE: As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder. ( shows the microcassette recorder ) Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
RAZOR: Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
BLADE: And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap.

JOEY!!!: EXT. OUTSIDE JOEY'S PLACE.
GILL: How's it going, Ray?
AGENT RAY: It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
GILL: In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
AGENT RAY: I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
GILL: Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
AGENT RAY: Alright sir. Agent Gill, can you spare a moment of your Why of course, Jennifer. Just how dangerous are hackers?
REPORTER: Agent Gill, can you spare a moment of your Why of course, Jennifer. Just how dangerous are hackers?
GILL: Why of course, Jennifer. Just how dangerous are hackers?
JOEY'S MOM: Just how dangerous are hackers?
JOEY: Just how dangerous are hackers?
JENNIFER: Just how dangerous are hackers?
GILL: Well, hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses.
JOEY'S MOM: .and stealing sensitive materials for their own ends. These people, they're terrorists.
GILL: .and stealing sensitive materials for their own ends. These people, they're terrorists.
JOEY'S MOM: INT. ELLINGSON MINERAL CORPORATION.
MARGO: Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
PLAGUE: ( to Margo ) ( to the board )
MARGO: Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
PLAGUE: Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love, sex, secret and. .God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
PLAGUE: A hacker planted the virus.
MARGO: Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
PLAGUE: Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
MARGO: Excuse me?
PLAGUE: ( as if to a child ) BOARD MEMBER
MARGO: What, it left a note? Unless five million dollars are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days, I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson Is that.
VIRUS: Unless five million dollars are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days, I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson Is that.
BOARD MEMBER: Is that.
PLAGUE: ( interrupting )
DUKE ELLINGSON: Well then, put the ships' ballasts under manual control.
PLAGUE: There's no such thing anymore, Duke. These ships are totally computerized. They rely on satellite navigation, which links them to our network, and the virus, wherever they are in the world.
MARGO: So what are we supposed to do?
PLAGUE: Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
SUIT #1: Now look, now we expect you to get onto this right away, yeah?
PLAGUE: SUIT #1
SUIT #1: Well, how soon?
PLAGUE: Well, we're working on it as fast as we can. This is a very common occurrence in corporations as large as ours. You have nothing to worry about.
SUIT #2: Yeah, right.
SUIT #1: Now, you're sure about that, Mr. The Plague?
PLAGUE: Yeah, the Secret Service is helping us out 100 percent. Okay?
SUIT #2: SUIT #1
SUIT #1: We'll be in touch. Talk to you later.
PLAGUE: We'll be in touch. Talk to you later.
MARGO: What the hell was that all about?
PLAGUE: I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
MARGO: I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
PLAGUE: I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
MARGO: I don't want to go to jail for this.
PLAGUE: Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
MARGO: But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
PLAGUE: Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
MARGO: Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You.
PLAGUE: Sh, sh sh sh sh.
PLAGUE: I'll take care of this.
SECRETARY: Alright, sir.
PLAGUE: I can cancel it any time. I don't need any program code. But it's the perfect cover, to confiscate the disc and find out how much of that garbage file has been copied.
MARGO: Get it! Why did I ever trust you? Get the file. Otherwise you'll lose all your
GILL: Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
PLAGUE: No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
GILL: Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
AGENT BOB: Listen to this bullshit. "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
AGENT RAY: Now that's cool.
AGENT BOB: AGENT RAY
AGENT RAY: Yeah, cool.
AGENT BOB: You think it's cool?
AGENT RAY: ( not caring for where Bob is going with this )
AGENT BOB: It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
CEREAL: ( to Phreak )
DADE: What is it with this guy?
PHREAK: His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
CEREAL: Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
PHREAK: Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
DADE: Did you talk to him?
PHREAK: Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes. He isn't to consort with his computer friends. The secret service is really out to get him. Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
PHREAK: It's at Kate's.
PHREAK: Thought so!
GILL: What the hell are you doing? Plague!
GILL: Plague finally notices, and takes off the helmet.
PLAGUE!: Plague finally notices, and takes off the helmet.
PLAGUE: I think we've got something.
GILL: I think we've got something.
PLAGUE: Uuugh, hard copy.
PLAGUE: Dade Murphy.
AGENT RAY: Secret Service!
AGENT BOB: Don't move!
DADE: Christ! What is the.
AGENT BOB: Shut up!
DADE: What are you doing, man? Get off me!
AGENT BOB: Just sit in the bed and keep your hands where we can see Dade has a flashback.
PLAGUE: The year was 1988. And this nasty virus crashed fifteen hundred systems in one day.
DADE: Fifteen hundred and seven.
AGENT RAY: ( astounded )
GILL: It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool? A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
PLAGUE: Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool? A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
GILL: However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
PLAGUE: The three secret service agents leave Plague and Dade alone. Plague shuts the door behind them.
PLAGUE: ( of Gill ) ( continues )
DADE: I'm sorry. Who are you?
PLAGUE: I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
DADE: Nah. I don't play well with others.
DADE: Shit! Come on!
PLAGUE: Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
PLAGUE: I'll be in touch.
PLAGUE: ( to agents ) ( to Dade )
DADE: Blow me.
PLAGUE: ( smiles )
PHREAK: Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help books for women. Stuff like "Women Who Love Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae"
DADE: That explains a lot.
PHREAK: ( loudly )
NIKON: Yo Phreak! Dade, man, you made it. Houston, we have liftoff, 3 o'clock, check it. don't look right away, what's wrong with you! Look at her man.
NIKON: ( concentrating )
DADE: How did you know that?

LISA: Hey, how do you know my name? Oooo, look at that pooper man. Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right!
CEREAL: Oooo, look at that pooper man. Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right!
VICKIE: Hi, my name is Vickie, and I'm an addict.
HANK: Hi, my name is Hank, and uh, I'm an addict.
JOEY: ( smoking )
JOEY: Nono, really, really, listen, listen to this. I got in trouble with my computer, right, okay, and my lawyer told the judge that I'm an addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer! No really, really,
JOEY: I'm not an addict. I'm not, I'm not.
JOEY: Can I get some more coffee?
PHREAK: Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!

MARGO: Pervert! What are you talking about?
PLAGUE: The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans. I just hacked into it.
MARGO: From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
PLAGUE: From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.

PLAGUE: So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
KATE: What the hell are you doing?
DADE: It's cool, I'm just looking.
KATE: It's too much machine for you.
DADE: Dade starts working furiously on it.
KATE: I hope you don't screw like you type.
DADE: It has a killer refresh rate.
KATE: P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
DADE: Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
KATE: Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change Yeah. RISC is good.
DADE: Yeah. RISC is good.
DADE: You sure this sweet machine's not going to Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
KATE: Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
DADE: Are you challenging me?
KATE: Are you challenging me?
DADE: Name your stakes.
KATE: If I win, you become my slave.
DADE: ( intrigued )
KATE: ( realizing his mind is in the gutter )
DADE: And if I win?
KATE: ( giggles )
DADE: Make it our first date.
KATE: You're not gonna win.
DADE: And you have to smile.
KATE: I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
PHREAK: ( voice over )
NIKON: Our decisions are final, by a vote of 2 to 1. No appeals.
CEREAL: The duel will last until we declare a winner.
PHREAK: Use only the dialups, access codes and passwords in your collection. Can't ask for any help from us.
DADE: ( into mirror )
PHREAK: Any questions?
KATE: Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
KATE: Alright, he's in the personal ads. "Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking for discreet friend to bring dreams to reality. Leather, lace, and water sports. Transvestites welcome."
GILL: I. I. I know where you can stick it. I know where you can stick it. .wanna lick your earlobes. I wanna lick your lips. I wanna lick your toes. I wanna lick your ankles.
CALLER: .wanna lick your earlobes. I wanna lick your lips. I wanna lick your toes. I wanna lick your ankles.

CALLER: That's why they call me Stallion.
GILL: Aw, that's disgusting!
CALLER: My heart is steaming for you.
CALLER: .spank you with my.
GILL: Aww, Spank your ass.
PLAGUE: EXT. EMPIRE STATE BULDING OBSERVATION DECK.
GILL: Hey! Hey, ow! Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am?
EMPLOYEE: ( on phone )
GILL: Our records indicate he's deceased.
EMPLOYEE: Our records indicate he's deceased.
GILL: I'm what?
DADE: Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
PHREAK: Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
DADE: Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
NIKON: Very impressive.
CEREAL: Super hero like even.
KATE: Yeah, whatever. What's the score?
PHREAK: The other four protest.
PHREAK: Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
DADE: Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our And if I win, so do you.
KATE: And if I win, so do you.
DADE: Kate gives Dade a look that says "I'm going to hold you to INT. KATE'S BED. NIGHT. A shapely figure wearing a red leather legless suit with a zipper that goes all the way around the crotch. Hands caress the sultry figure as the camera pans up. The body belongs to Dade Murphy. Kate wakes up gasping. It was only a dream. She pants and regains her breath. Then she smiles. She enjoyed that dream.
KATE: INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY.
KATE: Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed.
KATE: You are man enough to stick with the deal, aren't you?
DADE: He closes the door and opens the package. It is a laptop computer, clear plastic shell, full colour screen. Very high-end, perhaps the equal to Kate's machine. He turns it on. The Plague's face, distorted, appears. It speaks.
PLAGUE: You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool? Well let me explain the New World Order. Governments and corporations need people like you and me. We are samurai. The keyboard cowboys. And all those other people out there who have no idea what's going on are the cattle. Mooo! I need your help, you need my help. Let me help you earn your spurs. Ahh, think about it. Enjoy the laptop, "Cool"! Tell me where the disk is.
JOEY'S MOM: You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not grounded anymore.
PHREAK: Yo, what's up?
JOEY: Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
PHREAK: Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
JOEY: Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
PHREAK: Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
JOEY: I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
PHREAK: Oh shit, Joey, you've got a tail.
JOEY: The agents split up, one runs after Joey, the other after INT. HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM. Phreak has lost his tail. He puts Joey's disc behind a condom machine in the boys' room at school, and sticks it there with gum.
GILL: I'm watching you.
PHREAK'S MOM: Ramon? Wake up. Ramon! Wake up! Vamano. Time for school, come on.
AGENT: Secret Service, don't move!
PHREAK: Deja vu!
AGENT BOB: Ray Sanchez, you are under arrest, under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
PHREAK: What are you waiting for, arrest me already!
COP: You get one call. Uno. Understand?
OPERATOR: Hello, operator services.
PHREAK: Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a What number please?
OPERATOR: What number please?
PHREAK: Just one moment.
OPERATOR: Just one moment.
PHREAK: Thank you.
KATE: Hey, it's me.
PHREAK: Hey, it's me.
KATE: I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
PHREAK: I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
KATE: You think they're going to bust us?
PHREAK: Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
MRS. MURPHY: ( looking Kate over ) ( she shows them to Dade's room )
CEREAL: It's a nice room.
KATE: We need your help.
DADE: Do my ears deceive me?
CEREAL: Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things. What. It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
KATE: Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
DADE: I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
CEREAL: Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or
KATE: What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
DADE: I'm sorry, I can't.
KATE: Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do
MRS. MURPHY: Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in the fridge. Cereal has.
KATE: ( to Mrs. Murphy )
DADE: Okay. I'll copy it.
KATE: Okay, thank you.
PLAGUE: The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
DADE: I told you, I don't play well with others.
PLAGUE: Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a
PLAGUE: Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
DADE: That's bullshit.
PLAGUE: What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
DADE: You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
PLAGUE: Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of
PLAGUE: Talk to me.
DADE: I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
PLAGUE: Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
DADE: Kate, listen.
KATE: Uh, hold on.
DADE: I have to tell you something.
CEREAL: Hold on a second!
NIKON: Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
CEREAL: Looks like a hacker wrote it.
KATE: Come here, look at this. This thing is dense.
NIKON: But that's ill, man. It's incomplete. This is taking forever and a day to figure out. I'm gonna make some coffee.
CEREAL: Tag, you're in.
DADE: This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
NIKON: What's this one eat?
DADE: It nibbles. You see this?
DADE: This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
KATE: The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
DADE: And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
KATE: Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
DADE: Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it Right, and at this rate it ends its run in.
KATE: Right, and at this rate it ends its run in.
NIKON: Two days.
DADE: And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about.
CEREAL: 21.8 million bucks, man.
KATE: Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
DADE: I know, I know who wrote it.
KATE: This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
DADE: This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
KATE: You what?
DADE: I didn't know what was on it.
CEREAL: ( agitated )
NIKON: Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
KATE: Why did he come to you?
DADE: I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
NIKON: Zero Cool? Crashed fifteen hundred and seven systems in one day?
NIKON: Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
CEREAL: That's far out!
NIKON: This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
KATE: ( coldly )
DADE: I'll make it up to you!
KATE: I'll hack the Gibson.
DADE: I'll hack the Gibson.
NIKON: They'll trace you like that man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
DADE: Fucked if I care, man.
NIKON: Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in. five minutes.
CEREAL: Oh wow, we are fried.
KATE: ( suddenly lighter-hearted )
CEREAL: You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
NIKON: Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
DADE: Okay. Let's go shopping.
CEREAL: Woo hoo! Boom!
DADE: You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of honor, I might take advantage of this situation. Erotically, as it were.
GUARD: Alright, hold it right there!
DADE: It's my subway defense system.
KATE: It's my subway defense system.
NIKON: He's way down there.
CEREAL: Yo, brain dead, the manual!
NIKON: Yo, brain dead, the manual!
TRUCK!!!: The phone company tech jumps back in the hole, Cereal and Nikon take off.
WOMAN: Find it?
CEREAL: Phone's alright. The problem must be somewhere else.
MARGO: ( pacing )
PLAGUE: Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
MARGO: You said the worm was untreaceable!
PLAGUE: Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
MARGO: Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
PLAGUE: No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
PLAGUE: Look, there is no right and wrong. There is only fun and boring. A thirty year prison sentence sounds pretty dull to me. Who do you prefer serves it, us? Or them?
VIRUS: Unless five million dollars are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days, I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson
PLAGUE: ( sternly )
GILL: ( grimly )
CEREAL: Snoop onto them.
NIKON: .as they snoop onto us.
KATE: Yeah, it's Kate.
NIKON: Hey, Burn. We got a little problem here.
KATE: Alright, so what have we got?
DADE: Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
NIKON: Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but. my head hurts.
CEREAL: Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
DADE: Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
CEREAL: Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
KATE: What oil spills?
NIKON: Whoa, whoa. Yo, brain-dead, today is the Well this hasn't happened yet.
CEREAL: Well this hasn't happened yet.
KATE: Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run. I mean. Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look. "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
NIKON: ( angry )
CEREAL: A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
NIKON: Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, where are you going, I got an idea. We've got a few hours, right, till we get arrested. So just stay low. I'm gonna go get some help. I'll beep you, okay? Are you coming?
KATE: I got an idea. We've got a few hours, right, till we get arrested. So just stay low. I'm gonna go get some help. I'll beep you, okay? Are you coming?
CEREAL: May the Force be with you, man.
KATE: There they are!
DADE: Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
KATE: They're elite! Let's get 'em.
KATE: I lost 'em. Where were you?
DADE: I don't like this. AAAAAUGH! I definitely don't like this!
DADE: AAAAAUGH! I definitely don't like this!
BLADE: ( through video intercom )
DADE: Ummm. we come in peace?
KATE: We need your help. If you're up to it.
RAZOR: She's buff. Ballsy.
BLADE: Let's keep her.
RAZOR: Waste the dude.
KATE: A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
DADE: It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
KATE: We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
RAZOR: She's rabid, but cute.
BLADE: See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
DADE: ( noticing the stench of sellout )
RAZOR: Wait. Nobody said no. But you are going to need more than just two media icons like us. You need an army.
BLADE: That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
RAZOR: Hackers of the World, Unite!
BLADE: How are you going to take care of the cops?
GRAND CENTRAL: HACK THE PLANET Yo. I'm blowing up. It's Kate, Grand Central. Let's hit it!
CEREAL: Yo. I'm blowing up. It's Kate, Grand Central. Let's hit it!
CEREAL: Hey Joey, you made it!
KATE: Now listen up, use your best viruses to buy us time, we have to get into Plague's file and copy the worm.
CEREAL: Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, Go fix the phones.
KATE: Go fix the phones.
CEREAL: Go fix the phones.
KATE: Go fix the phones.
CEREAL: Cereal takes off to fix the phones.
KATE: Joey, take his place.
JOEY: What, me?
KATE: Take his place, man, do it. You can do it.
KATE: Alright, let's boot up.
DADE: Alright, let's boot up.
KATE: Alright, let's boot up.
MARGO: What is it? What's wrong?
PLAGUE: Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
MARGO: "Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
HAL: There's a new virus in the database.
MARGO: What's happening?
HAL: It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I Type "Cookie", you idiot. I'll head 'em off at the pass.
PLAGUE: Type "Cookie", you idiot. I'll head 'em off at the pass.
HAL: We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
PLAGUE: Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
PLAGUE: Die, dickweeds!
HAL: The rabbit is in the administration system.
PLAGUE: Send a Flu-shot.
MARGO: Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
HAL: A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
MARGO: The Da Vinci Virus sings "Row Row Row Your Boat". Tanker ballasts start filling - for real.
KATE: It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
DADE: Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
PLAGUE: They're at Grand Central Station, lower level. Don't screw up.
PLAGUE: Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence. You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
DADE: Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
PLAGUE: Give it up! Just give it up.
RAZOR: Are we fashionably late?
SYSOP: We have massive infection. Multiple GPI and FSI viruses.
HAL: They're coming in from remote nodes. They're going after the Kernal!
MARGO: Colonel who?
HAL: The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
MARGO: Cancer, brain. Brain Cancer?
DUKE ELLINGSON: Belford, what's going on?
PLAGUE: In short, Duke, a shit storm.
DADE: I found it! I found it!
PLAGUE: This is the end, my friend. Thank you for calling!
DADE: Oh, shit! He got me.
NIKON: Joey's getting stupid busy.
DADE: Joey. I need you to drop your viruses, go after the worm. You're the closest.
DADE: It's root slash period workspace slash period garbage period.
GILL: It's an empty bank of payphones, the receivers are linked together and taped up. No hackers. They keep going.
GILL: ( pissed off but determined )
KATE: ( to Razor and Blade )
RAZOR: Roger that.
PLAGUE: Come on you son of a bitch, is that all you got, huh? Come on, let's see what else you can do! You talking to me? Huh? Hahahaha. Are you nuts? Come at me!
HAL: They're in the kernal.

WE GOTCHA!: MESS WITH THE BEST DIE LIKE THE REST Little pissant!
PLAGUE: Little pissant!
NIKON: We did it!
DADE: We did it!
KATE: Let's get out of here!
GILL: The SS have caught up with the hackers. Agent Bob seems to be choosing which pore on which hacker's face to blow away first. Only Joey thinks to put his hands up. As they are led away, a handcuffed Dade surrreptitiously tosses the disc with the worm into a trashcan.

THE PLANET!: Shut up and get in the car!
GILL: Shut up and get in the car!
CEREAL: ( understanding the hidden message )
PLAGUE: We caught 'em.

PLAGUE: Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
GILL: Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
DADE: Me, alright? I did it. She knows shit about computers. She. she's just my girlfriend.
GILL: ( laughing )

DADE: Thanks for your help.
KATE: Thanks for your help.
GILL: ( grimly ) MRS. MURPHY
MRS. MURPHY: My son happens to be a genius. He understands something happening today that you won't comprehend if you live to be a hundred, and he would never use what he knows to harm a living
AGENT BOB: The news crew you requested is here.
MRS. MURPHY: Oh good. Cause I have a few things to tell Your son is facing thirty felony counts in an ongoing investigation. You face possible arrest if you do that.
GILL: Your son is facing thirty felony counts in an ongoing investigation. You face possible arrest if you do that.
MRS. MURPHY: Mister, I don't care if I face certain death.
GILL: Mrs. Murphy stays right here.
KATE: Oh, wow, she's great.
DADE: INT. SECRET SERVICE OFFICES.
REPORTER: .and attacked the Ellingson's computer network. Is the last we've seen of this type of high-tech espionage?
GILL: Well, I'm afraid not. Hackers are a grave threat to the national security. This incident just proves without a doubt that we need increased funding to stop.
SOMEONE: That kid cut him off!
CEREAL: Hold on, boys and girls. It is I, the Cereal Killer, making my first coast to coast, world wide, global television appearance. Yes, that's right, I'm here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched from within Ellingson
CEREAL: But for what, you ask? World domination? Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called Da Vinci, that when launched, would cause Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was really the smokescreen, right. What could be so vitally important to protect that someone would create such a nasty, antisocial, very uncool virus program? But why? Could it be to cover the tracks for this worm program? A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks. The password for this hungry little sucker belongs to Margo Wallace, head of public relations at Ellingson Mineral.

MARGO: I don't even know how to work a VCR, let alone a computer! Get off! Look, listen, I'll make a deal. Eugene Belford! I know where his mother is, I promise you. Get offa me! I need a lawyer!
STEWARDESS: Here you are, Mr. Babbage. Flight time to Tokyo should be about 14 hours today. Can I get you anything else?
PLAGUE: Just a pillow please.
PLAGUE: Thank you.
GILL: You're welcome.
PLAGUE: What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
DADE: You look good in a dress.
KATE: You would have looked better.
DADE: Wanna go for a swim?
KATE: I can't believe they decided you won.
DADE: They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
KATE: Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
H: Kate laughs, honestly impressed.
