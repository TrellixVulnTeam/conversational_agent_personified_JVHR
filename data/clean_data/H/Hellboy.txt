Nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal glove, empty and smoking. As the Allies approach, the fighting rages on. Grigory and Ilsa are gone. And for now, so is Kroenen.

MATLIN: It's got a big stone in its hand
BROOM: I think that is its hand.
BROOM: In deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna. Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket. Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED THING shrinks back. Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons around it. The creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist. Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the Whitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows the RED THING climbing into Broom's arms. Broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers snatch the candy. Broom smiles.
YOUNG SOLDIER: Jesus! would'ya look at the size of that whammer!
BROOM: It's a boy. Just a baby boy.

GUARD 1: You! Don't move! Hands up!
GUARD 6: Something is clearly stopping him. His hand breaks, twisted by an unseen force!! The flesh on his neck pushes upwards, held by an invisible force. He starts floating in mid-air. The blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows red and amber. They outline a figure formerly submerged in shadows. GRIGORY. He gestures with both hands, as if holding an imaginary doll. His arm muscles twitch under his skin, shifting, changing, gaining strength. With a quick gesture Grigory twists the lower and upper parts of the guard's body in opposite directions. With a wet CRUNCH, the guard's shadow on the wall goes limp. Grigory looks at Ilsa.

ABE: Yes, you are.
BROOM: What I ask from you is Have the courage to stand by his side after I'm gone. Help him find himself. Who he must be. He was born a Demon. You will help him become a man.

A caption reads: ELIZABETH SHERMAN, first interview, BPRD, PYROKINETIC. She has a POLAROID camera in her hands. Shoots one at the lens.
LIZ: I don't like the term "firestarter." I just don't. And "Pyrokinesis" sounds like psychosis or something. I dunno maybe that's right. Not being able to let go Scary. Sometimes you hear so-and-so lost control and just exploded. They're lucky it isn't true. With me it is.
OMIT: INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT Two strolling ORDERLIES shine their flashlights inside the rooms on both sides of a long corridor.

OMIT: INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT Hellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings: a large church- like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar. Off to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on the explosive belts. Next to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab bought from Lapikov. Liz lies at Grigory's feet. He's dressed in a ceremonial robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy, he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key.
GRIGORY: "And I looked and beheld an Angel, and in his hand the key to the bottomless pit." These were the words I heard as a peasant boy in Tobolsk. And now, the door Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so that they might at long last enter our world.
GRIGORY: ( gestures at the stone piece ) These were the words I heard as a peasant boy in Tobolsk. And now, the door Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so that they might at long last enter our world.

ILSA: Imagine it: An eden for you and her
HELLBOY: Grigory turns to Hellboy.
GRIGORY: ( reasonable ) In exchange for her life then, open the door.
GRIGORY: As you wish.
GRIGORY: She's dead.
HELLBOY: Noooo! Noooo!!! Her soul awaits on the other side. If you want her back. Open the door and claim her.
GRIGORY: Her soul awaits on the other side. If you want her back. Open the door and claim her.
HELLBOY: For her.
GRIGORY: Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads." And crossroads I have become. Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
HELLBOY: ( closing his eyes )
MYERS: No!! Don't do it!! Listen to me!!
GRIGORY: The final seal. Open it!
MYERS: ( to Hellboy ) Remember who you are!!!

HELLBOY: Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
MYERS: How big can it be?
HELLBOY: How big can it be?
HELLBOY: They never work
HELLBOY: Ugh Now, this is gonna hurt
OMIT: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT A chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as Behemoth is enveloped in a cloud of fire, goo and soft flesh. Hellboy lands with a sickening, bone-crunching THUD!!! With a bellow, Behemoth goes down, the limp tentacles missing Hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light. Finally, just a few cinders of flesh float in the air.
HELLBOY: Ouch It did hurt.
LIZ: In the dark I heard your voice What did you say ?
HELLBOY: "You, on the other side: let her go. Because for her, for her I'll die. I'll cross over." "And you'll be sorry I did."
