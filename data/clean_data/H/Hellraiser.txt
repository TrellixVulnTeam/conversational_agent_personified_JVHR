HELLRAISER: A Screenplay Clive Barker
CENOBITE: ( unseen ) It's over .
LARRY: It's one of these.
JULIA: We're going to freeze to death.
LARRY: 0.K. 0.K.
JULIA: Maybe somebody changed the lock.
LARRY: ( slightly irritated ) Like who?
JULIA: Just a thought -
LARRY: The key is turned.
LARRY: The door swings open. We see the pair on the doorstep. LARRY is an American in his early forties, an attractive man who has lost his edge in recent years. He looks harassed; he smirks too much. A little, but significant, corner of him is utterly defeated. JULIA, his wife, is English: and looks perhaps ten years his junior. She is beautiful, but her face betrays a barely buried unhappiness. Life has disappointed her too, of late: and LARRY has been a major part of their They step over the threshold.
LARRY: Well. This is it.
JULIA: It smells damp.
LARRY: It's just been empty a while.
LARRY: ( from below ) Besides, it's an old house.
JULIA: How long since you were here?
LARRY: The best part of ten years.
LARRY: I wanted to sell it off at one point, after the old Lady died, but I couldn't get Frank to agree.
LARRY: ( with pleasure ) Christ. It's not been touched.
LARRY: Look at this.
JULIA: Why didn't he want to sell it?
LARRY: ( dismissively ) I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway. Look at this stuff.
JULIA: Not exactly modern.
LARRY: ( shrugs ) We'll sell it. Sell everything.
JULIA: I thought half of it was your He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
LARRY: He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
LARRY: You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
JULIA: You mean we're moving in?
LARRY: You don't like it?
JULIA: It's better than Brooklyn. You're still blaming me.
LARRY: You're still blaming me.
JULIA: No. I'm not.
LARRY: You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
JULIA: All right.
LARRY: So what's the argument?
JULIA: ( cold ) No argument.
LARRY: Oh Christ. Julia .
LARRY: ( exasperated, to
JULIA: He leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the bottom of the stairs. He starts up the stairs.
LARRY: I hear you.
LARRY: Where are you?
JULIA: ( out of sight ) In here.
JULIA: LARRY steps past her, and throws back the blankets. Wood-lice scurry away. He goes to the suitcase, and starts looking through it. Besides clothes there's a lot else that speaks of its owner: bric-a-brac picked up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets; Fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from a dozen countries. Amongst the stuff, some photographs. LARRY peers at them. One pictures a good-looking intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed with a naked Chinese girl.
LARRY: At the door, we see JULIA almost flinch at the name.
JULIA: He's here?
LARRY: He's been here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit. That'll be Kirsty.
LARRY: Hello .? Hello .?
LARRY: ( on'phone ) Is there anybody there?
LARRY: ( from below ) There's nobody there -
LARRY: I'm surprised it's even connected .
LARRY: Who's there?
KIRSTY: ( barely audible )
CUT TO: 19 INT. KIRSTY'S ROOM DAY
KIRSTY: I got through.
KIRSTY: I found a room.
LARRY: ( on 'phone ) What did you say?
KIRSTY: I said: I found a room.
KIRSTY: ( pained ) No Dad.
KIRSTY: YOU'D like my room.
KIRSTY: ( hastily ) No, no. Not just yet. It needs . er . some work.
KIRSTY: I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
KIRSTY: ( mouths the word ) Well come over, will you? See the place?
KIRSTY: Maybe tomorrow. I got to go look for a job.
KIRSTY: I love you too.
LARRY: ( resigned ) Why not?
JULIA: ( resigned ) Why not?
LARRY: ( smiles; he's pleased ) We'll move in Sunday.
1ST MAN: Famous last fucking words.
LARRY: ( not seeing Julia ) Alright, let's give it another ( sees Julia ) Do you really need this bed, lady?
2ND MAN: ( sees Julia ) Do you really need this bed, lady?
LARRY: How are you doing through It looks like a bomb's dropped.
JULIA: It looks like a bomb's dropped.
2ND MAN: Got any beer?
JULIA: There's some in the 'fridge.
LARRY: I'll get it.
2ND MAN: ( seeing Kirsty ) It's my lucky day.
KIRSTY: 2ND MAN
2ND MAN: Want to buy a bed?
KIRSTY: Not much.
KIRSTY: LARRY emerges from one of the rooms, looking harassed. His face lightens as he sees his daughter.
LARRY: They hug each other.
KIRSTY: Big house.
LARRY: You like?
KIRSTY: Me like.
LARRY: I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
KIRSTY: Is Julia here?
LARRY: ( his voice lowers ) Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
KIRSTY: ( dryly ) ( a gently chiding O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
LARRY: ( a gently chiding O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
KIRSTY: O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
LARRY: Kitchen's through on your left
2ND MAN: That your daughter?
LARRY: 2ND MAN ( grins oafishly )
2ND MAN: ( grins oafishly ) Got her mother's looks.
LARRY: Her mother's dead.
2ND MAN: Julia's my second wife.
LARRY: Julia's my second wife.
2ND MAN: ( weakly ) Lucky man.
LARRY: Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
FRANK: Can I come in?
FRANK: Can I come in?
KIRSTY: Shit! Shit!
LARRY: ( calls through ) Are you O.K.?
KIRSTY: ( from kitchen )
CUT TO: the person who opened the door. It's JULIA; a younger JULIA, her hair arranged differently, her clothes brighter. It is two weeks before her marriage to LARRY. She looks at the man on the doorstep without a trace of recognition on her face.
FRANK: You're Julia, right?
JULIA: That's right. Who are you?
FRANK: ( a dazzling smile ) I'm brother Frank.
JULIA: ( smiles ) I came for the wedding.
FRANK: I came for the wedding.
JULIA: Oh. Oh yes.
FRANK: Well can I come in or not?
JULIA: I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
FRANK: That's nice to know. Have you got a towel?
JULIA: Hi. I got soaked.
KIRSTY: Hi. I got soaked.
JULIA: There's a towel in the bath- Which is where?
KIRSTY: Which is where?
JULIA: Just to your left.
KIRSTY: Did Dad tell you I got a room, by the way? Waterloo. Centre of the known universe.
1ST MAN: Have you got it?
2ND MAN: I've got it. I told you -
LARRY: Wait! Wait!
JULIA: FRANK ( 0.S. )
JULIA: But you said -
FRANK: I don't want to see the dress.
FRANK: You know what I want. I want you.
FRANK: I want you.
CUT TO: FRANK. He is not so beraggled as in the first scene, but the heat of the day has brought a sheen of sweat to his face. Standing half in shadow he looks almost Now JULIA lets the dress drop, putting it on the bed behind her.
FRANK: That's better
JULIA: What about Larry -
FRANK: Forget him.
LARRY: Slowly, will you? Slowly!
JULIA: Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.
JULIA: ( a whisper ) Oh Frank .
LARRY: ( to Movers ) Will you take the weight while I take a step up? Damn it, will you take the -
LARRY: 1ST MAN
1ST MAN: What's the problem?
LARRY: My fucking hand!
LARRY: You fucking ass-holes.
1ST MAN: Who are you calling a fucking ass-hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
LARRY: . Oh Christ .
LARRY: . oh . Christ .
KIRSTY: What's happening?
2ND MAN: We're leaving.
KIRSTY: Where's my father?
1ST MAN: He's fucked off.
2ND MAN: ( mock chiding ) Eh . LANGUAGE.
1ST MAN: Sorry. He's gone upstairs. So we're fucking off too.
2ND MAN: Will you sign for the bed?
KIRSTY: 48 INT. STAIRS DAY
LARRY: ( weakly ) . Julia .
JULIA: What have you done?
LARRY: I cut myself.
JULIA: Is it deep?
LARRY: I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
JULIA: You're NOT going to faint.
LARRY: ( he leans againts Let me see.
JULIA: Let me see.
JULIA: It's probably going to need I'm going to throw up.
LARRY: I'm going to throw up.
JULIA: No, you're not. We'll get you out into the fresh air.
JULIA: Take it slowly.
LARRY: So damn stupid.
JULIA: You're done worse.
LARRY: I'll be scarred for life.
JULIA: No you won't.
KIRSTY: What happened?
JULIA: Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
KIRSTY: The keys are in the kitchen.
JULIA: The keys are in the kitchen.
CUT TO: the remains of a rack of lamb, its gravy now congealed, scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there. This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen. We pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles. Finally, we reach JULIA, who is still sitting at the table, while the others have retired to more comfortable seats. She looks utterly miserable, and a little The room has been spruced up for the party. Candles are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are pictures on the walls. But this is essentially cosmetic. The place has not been refurnished or re- We move to the party guests. Two, we recognize: KIRSTY, and LARRY - who is presently entertaining the gathering with an account of his accident. The others are new faces. An American couple: BILL UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN, who are of an age with LARRY, and a younger, bespectacled man - a work colleague of LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL. All are drunk. A brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and half a dozen other liquer bottles besides. STEVE, it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on KIRSTY. LARRY is half-way through his hospital story, gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale, much to the pleasure of the rest. His hand and lower arm are heavily bandaged.
LARRY: - always hated the sight of my own blood. I go out like a light. Anybody else's? no problem. But mine . you know . goes straight to my head. Anyhow, this damn doctor's poking around and I'm saying: I'm going to pass out, and he's saying, no you're not, no you're not. Next thing I know -
LARRY: - I wake up On the floor. And it was HIM who was looking Probably thought you'd sue.
BILL: Probably thought you'd sue.
LARRY: I should do it!
EVELYN: Doctors -
LARRY: I know. And he's saying: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
BILL: HE'S sorry.
LARRY: Right . Anyone for more?
EVELYN: ( protests ) No . no . I .
LARRY: Come on, you're only young once -
LARRY: ( to Kirsty ) What are you drinking, love?
KIRSTY: ( giggles ) I've forgotten.
LARRY: We're on the Cointreau.
STEVE: We're on the Cointreau.
KIRSTY: That's right. Cointreau.
STEVE: I'll do it.
KIRSTY: I won't be able to stand.
STEVE: So lie down.
JULIA: Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
LARRY: Are you O.K.?
BILL: ( looks at his watch ) Christ. I think it's time we were away -
LARRY: Bill? Absolutely not. Sit down. We've got celebrating to do.
STEVE: ( to Julia ) It was a wonderful meal.
EVELYN: ( gushing ) Oh it was. It was wonderful.
JULIA: I'm glad you enjoyed it.
EVELYN: See you again soon.
BILL: You must come round.
EVELYN: Yes. You must. We're so happy you're back.
JULIA: ( at the door ) That's nice. Well . goodnight.
EVELYN: Does it still hurt?
LARRY: Only when I laugh.
JULIA: Who's there?
FRANK: ( a pained whisper ) Oh my God.
JULIA: Oh my God.
FRANK: Don't look at me.
JULIA: Who are you?
FRANK: I said: don't look. Help me.
JULIA: Tell me who you are.
FRANK: JULIA's face registers horror and disbelief.
JULIA: No. God no.
FRANK: Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
JULIA: What happened to you?
FRANK: His blood . on the floor . It brought me back.
JULIA: Back from where?
FRANK: Just help, will you? Please God, help me -
STEVE: You're not going?
KIRSTY: Just upstairs.
STEVE: Need any help?
KIRSTY: I AM house-trained.
STEVE: ( covered in embarrass- No . I meant .
LARRY: It's round on the left -
KIRSTY: I know.
FRANK: . somebody .
JULIA: The sound of KIRSTY downstairs, closing the bathroom
FRANK: You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
JULIA: What do you want me to do.
FRANK: The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back .
FRANK: ( a plea ) You have to heal me.
KIRSTY: JULIA moves out of shadow into a patch of patterned light splashing up the stair well.The effect recalls her memory of her lovemaking with FRANK. The light makes her look strange; ominous.
KIRSTY: Oh, it's you. Are you all right?
STEVE: KIRSTY is relieved at the interruption.
KIRSTY: ( calls down ) I'm here.
STEVE: I thought we'd lost you.
KIRSTY: ( calls down ) I'm coming! ( to Julia ) Sleep well.
KIRSTY: You know I do know the way home.
STEVE: It's late.
KIRSTY: Not that late.
STEVE: Please. I want to see you home. All right?
KIRSTY: ( lightly ) All right. ( smiles ) No. That's nice.
STEVE: If there's a train.
KIRSTY: What do we do if there isn't?
STEVE: We walk.
STEVE: Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
KIRSTY: Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
STEVE: I see.
KIRSTY: She's so damn . English.
STEVE: Meaning what?
KIRSTY: Oh, I don't know. Up-tight.
STEVE: I beg your pardon?
KIRSTY: ( lightly ) There ya go. ( imitates his tone ) I beg your pardon?
STEVE: We're not all frigid.
KIRSTY: Oh no?
STEVE: Oh no.
KIRSTY: It's not what I heard.
STEVE: ( moves closer to Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
FRANK: JULIA stares at the thing moving in the shadow.
JULIA: 64 EXT. NUMBER 55 DAY
1ST CUSTOMER: Excuse me, Miss -
2ND CUSTOMER: I'd like some more lager.
1ST CUSTOMER: In a moment.
KIRSTY: In a moment.
2ND CUSTOMER: Did you hear me?
STEVE: Hey, sex-bomb -
KIRSTY: You keep your - I just called in. How about I don't finish till twelve.
STEVE: I just called in. How about I don't finish till twelve.
KIRSTY: I don't finish till twelve.
STEVE: I'm a late riser.
2ND CUSTOMER: What do you have to do to get some service around here?
STEVE: Catch you later.
PRUDHOE: Not much fun, is it?
JULIA: Drinking alone.
PRUDHOE: Drinking alone.
JULIA: Not much.
PRUDHOE: I wonder, maybe . . as we're both on our own . we could have one drink together?
JULIA: Why not?
PRUDHOE: ( to Julia ) What are you drinking?
JULIA: Just soda.
PRUDHOE: Plain soda?
JULIA: I try not to drink at lunch- time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh? One soda, one whisky. I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
PRUDHOE: I try not to drink at lunch- time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh? One soda, one whisky. I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
JULIA: ( looking straight That depends.
PRUDHOE: He stares at her, not certain he interprets her correctly. She stares back. Then: the tiniest of smiles, which he - scarcely believing his luck - returns.
PRUDHOE: You know it's not often I . you know .
JULIA: There's a first time for every- I suppose that's right.
PRUDHOE: I suppose that's right.
JULIA: You want something to drink?
PRUDHOE: I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for Oh, come on. It's what you brought me here for, isn't it?
PRUDHOE: Oh, come on. It's what you brought me here for, isn't it?
JULIA: Yes. I just think we'd be better off upstairs.
PRUDHOE: Oh. Oh fine.
PRUDHOE: This your place?
JULIA: Let's not talk about it.
PRUDHOE: No personal details, right?
JULIA: You know, you're incredible -
PRUDHOE: You know, you're incredible -
JULIA: Come on in. Make yourself at There's no bed.
PRUDHOE: There's no bed.
JULIA: That's right.
PRUDHOE: I prefer the floor.
JULIA: I prefer the floor.
PRUDHOE: First time for everything, right?
JULIA: JULIA moves towards him
JULIA: Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
PRUDHOE: Yeah, why don't I? Why don't you do the same?
PRUDHOE: ( takes over his undressing ) Why don't you do the same?
JULIA: Maybe I will.
PRUDHOE: ( voice slightly slurred ) You know, you're very beautiful.
JULIA: Am I?
PRUDHOE: You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
PRUDHOE: Oh Christ.
JULIA: What's wrong?
PRUDHOE: Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
PRUDHOE: I'll be a moment.
PRUDHOE: The door's stuck.
PRUDHOE: Don't . I . please . I'm sorry . . I'm so sorry . . I don't understand .
JULIA: The room sighs. In the corner, FRANK's shadowy form leans forward.
FRANK: Don't look at me.
JULIA: Jesus Christ.
FRANK: ( his voice stronger ) Do I disgust you?
FRANK: See? It's making me whole Every drop of blood you spill puts more flesh on my bones. And we both want that don't Good. Come here. Come here, damn you. I want to touch you .
FRANK: ( more softly ) Come to Daddy. I only want to touch . ( from below )
LARRY: ( from below )
LARRY: ( from below ) Where are you?
LARRY: Are you there?
FRANK: Who's a pretty boy then?
LARRY: ( quietly )
LARRY: Are you there?
LARRY: ( from bathroom ) I'm here.
JULIA: ( from bathroom ) I'm here.
LARRY: ( at the door ) Sweetheart . I've been calling you. Are you all right?
JULIA: Just feeling a bit sick.
LARRY: Oh, babe .
JULIA: I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
LARRY: Can I get you anything?
JULIA: Maybe a brandy.
LARRY: I'll be down in a minute
JULIA: I'll be down in a minute
LARRY: She listens as his footsteps recede down the landing and stairs. Then she crosses to the mirror and tries to erase the signs of panic. She puts a comb through her hair, and adjusts her blouse. That done, she unbolts the door and steps out into the landing. She doesn't go down however, but UP, back to the Torture Room.
JULIA: ( very softly )
FRANK: I'm hurting
JULIA: My nerves . are beginning to work again.
FRANK: My nerves . are beginning to work again.
JULIA: One more. Maybe two - - to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
FRANK: One more. Maybe two - - to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
JULIA: The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
FRANK: The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
LARRY: Julia? Are you all right?
JULIA: Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
LARRY: She returns to her conversation with FRANK.
FRANK: Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
JULIA: Keep your voice down.
FRANK: Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
JULIA: You're hurting.
FRANK: You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse . . like love. Only real.
CUT TO: 88 INT. KIRSTY'S ROOM NIGHT
STEVE: What are you doing?
STEVE: Christ. What was that about?
LARRY'S VOICE: 90 INT. BEDROOM NIGHT
LARRY: I'm O.K., honey. It's all right .
KIRSTY: I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
LARRY: Never better. You sleep well. I love you, honey. I love you too.
LARRY: I love you, honey. I love you too.
LARRY: He goes into the bedroom. We PAN up the second flight of stairs. FRANK is sitting at the top, in the shadows.
FRANK: ( soft as a breath )
VICTIM: You're sure we're not going to be interrupted -
JULIA: Quite sure.
VICTIM: Only I like to be careful.
JULIA: Better. Much better. I'd like some clothes. And maybe a cigarette.
FRANK: Better. Much better. I'd like some clothes. And maybe a cigarette.
JULIA: Then you tell me . you explain what happened to you?
FRANK: Of course.
FRANK: That's what they call themselves. They're not human. Maybe they were once, but they're not now. They rearrange their own flesh for pleasure.
JULIA: And the box?
FRANK: It cost me a fortune. All I had. It's a puzzle you see. You solve it, and the Cenobites come through .
JULIA: Where from?
FRANK: God knows. Sometimes I think they're just behind the walls .
JULIA: So they cheated you
FRANK: Oh no. They kept to their bargain. They gave me experiences I'd never forget .
FRANK: But their pleasure was my pain.
FRANK: Terrible pain. Appalling . My body was forfeit. But my spirit . they left that here. In the boards. In the walls. Watching the world, but never able to touch it .
JULIA: And the blood let you out?
FRANK: There are ways to resurrection. Blood's one of them. I won't let them take me back, Julia.
FRANK: I want to be whole, and then get out - I won't let them take me.
JULIA: You won't have to. We'll be gone. Somewhere they'll never find us. Not in the whole wide world.
LARRY: Is this upsetting you?
JULIA: I've seen worse.
LARRY: Are you all right?
JULIA: Only I'll turn it off -
LARRY: Only I'll turn it off -
COMMENTATOR: And he's down! He's down!
COMMENTATOR: - and now he's in trouble, he's really in trouble -
LARRY: What was that?
JULIA: The violence on the screen is horrific, as swollen faces burst beneath punches.
LARRY: No. Something else.
JULIA: Maybe I left a window open - - I'll go see.
LARRY: No. I'll do it.
JULIA: It was nothing. Larry .
LARRY: What's wrong with you? I just hate the thunder.
JULIA: I just hate the thunder.
LARRY: I'm here. You're shaking. There's nothing to be afraid I'll just go check upstairs .
LARRY: Oh baby.
JULIA: Don't go upstairs.
LARRY: Come with me then.
JULIA: Please .
JULIA: Lightning floods the room. It's empty. She stands beside him at the door.
LARRY: We must have rats.
LARRY: See? Quite safe. Let's go down. I'll make it
LARRY: . oh babe .
LARRY: .I love you, honey . let me . oh God . I love you .
LARRY: Oh baby . I love you .
JULIA: . no .
JULIA: No. No, you mustn't. PLEASE.
LARRY: ( looks at her ) Please .
JULIA: Please .
LARRY: What's wrong with you?
JULIA: ( almost sobbing ) Please. I can't bear it .
LARRY: I don't understand you. One moment you're all over me, the next it's: Don't touch me. I just don't understand.
LARRY: . maybe we should never have come back.
KIRSTY: Maybe you should give it some I guess.
LARRY: I guess.
KIRSTY: ( skirting her real feelings ) She's not like Mom. She's . I don't know . moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
LARRY: You don't like her at all do you?
KIRSTY: I don't know her. She's so . sealed up. If YOU love her she must be worth loving. Just give me some time.
LARRY: She doesn't even want to leave the house.
KIRSTY: It's like she's waiting for I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
LARRY: It's like she's waiting for I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
KIRSTY: I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
LARRY: I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
LARRY: ( hesitant ) Would you . maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
KIRSTY: Maybe all she needs is some
LARRY: Maybe all she needs is some
FRANK: You can't love him.
JULIA: I don't.
FRANK: So where's the harm?
JULIA: I said no.
FRANK: Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
SYKES: I get lonely sometimes.
JULIA: Everybody does.
JULIA: Come in.

KIRSTY: Keep your fucking distance. Julia! Where's Julia? Christ, what have you done with her.
FRANK: Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
KIRSTY: You remember.
FRANK: You remember.
KIRSTY: Come to Daddy.
FRANK: Come to Daddy.
KIRSTY: No. Get the fuck off me.
FRANK: You've grown. You're beautiful.
KIRSTY: Don't touch me. Or so help me -
FRANK: What? What will you do? What can you do? There's nothing to be frightened
FRANK: I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
KIRSTY: This isn't happening.
FRANK: I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter .
FRANK: Give that to me.
KIRSTY: ( breathless ) One last time. Give me the You want it? Fucking have it!
FRANK: One last time. Give me the You want it? Fucking have it!
KIRSTY: You want it? Fucking have it!

KIRSTY: I want to speak to my father .

KIRSTY: Why not?
DOCTOR: Chin up. There's no serious damage. And you're safe here.
KIRSTY: He leaves the room. KIRSTY picks up the box, tentatively. She turns it over in her hand, examining it.
JULIA: She'll tell them everything .
FRANK: I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
JULIA: That's probably her now. Or the police.
FRANK: Don't you care?
JULIA: Don't you care?
FRANK: There's very little I can do about it.
JULIA: Maybe we should just leave -

NURSE: Of course.

STEVE: What's wrong?
KIRSTY: Don't let them take me, Steve -
STEVE: I won't let anybody take you.

KIRSTY: Will you GO, damn you?
STEVE: I'll come back later, huh?
KIRSTY: Sure. Why not?
STEVE: FEMALE CENOBITE
KIRSTY: FEMALE CENOBITE
FEMALE CENOBITE: It's time we were away.
CENOBITE: It's time we were away.
KIRSTY: ( almost crying ) Let me alone, will you?
CENOBITE: No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
KIRSTY: He stops.
CENOBITE: No time for argument.
KIRSTY: You did this before, right?
CENOBITE: Many times.
KIRSTY: To a man called Frank Cotton?
FEMALE CENOBITE: Oh yes.
KIRSTY: But he escaped you.
CENOBITE: Nobody escapes us.
KIRSTY: HE did. I've seen him. He's Is that so? And what are you I'll take you to him. Then you take him instead of me. Back wherever you come from.

JULIA: Kirsty? It's very late.
KIRSTY: Where's Daddy?
JULIA: What's the problem?
KIRSTY: ( stepping inside ) I have to see my father.
JULIA: Of course. There's no need to
JULIA: You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
KIRSTY: I was here this afternoon.
JULIA: This afternoon.
KIRSTY: I saw everything.
JULIA: I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
KIRSTY: Oh God. Thank God. I thought something might have . I have to talk to you.
LARRY: Of course.
LARRY: It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right .
KIRSTY: No. You don't understand. Your brother - Frank - he's here in the house. And he's -
LARRY: Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
KIRSTY: ( smiles ) He's gone.
LARRY: ( smiles ) He's gone.
KIRSTY: He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery -
JULIA: He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery -
LARRY: He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery -
CENOBITE: . we'll tear your soul apart .
LARRY: I'll go to the police, when I'm feeling stronger. Try and find some way to make them understand, though God knows I don't really understand myself. Did he hurt
LARRY: ( leans back ) Poor Frank. He's better off I don't believe it.
KIRSTY: I don't believe it.
LARRY: I'm afraid it's true.
KIRSTY: ( tears in her eyes ) I want to see.
LARRY: No you don't.
KIRSTY: ( to Julia ) Show her.
LARRY: ( to Julia ) Show her.
CUT TO: LARRY, still sitting at the table. His fingers drum a familiar tattoo. Beneath his breath, he hums 'Colonel 166 INT. UPPER LANDING NIGHT JULIA pushes open the door of the Torture Room. It creaks wide. Lying on the floor inthe middle of the room is a skinned corpse, in a tangle of torn clothing. It steams. There is blood everywhere. That too, steams. KIRSTY is revolted. She steps away from the door, back down the landing. The bell has begun to ring again, distantly, and there is the sound of wings in the air - thousands of birds - beating on the other side of the wall. KIRSTY starts down the stairs again.
JULIA: Where are you going?
JULIA: ( calling after You leave this to us, you hear me? We'll deal with the police -
LARRY: Where are you going?
KIRSTY: I have to get out.
LARRY: Stay with me -
LARRY: - it's all right. Really it is .
KIRSTY: I can't stay.
LARRY: Come to Daddy.
LARRY: Come to Daddy.
JULIA: No, damn you -
KIRSTY: ( mouths ) Oh my God.
JULIA: KIRSTY screams, as FRANK lunges for her. The lights in the hallway flicker, and threaten to go out. KIRSTY avoids FRANK's blow, but in doing so allows him to get between her and the front door. She's trapped. His torn face flapping, he opens his jacket ( the interior of which is blood-stained ) and pulls a knife from the Suddenly, JULIA is behind her, gripping hold of her hair. FRANK advances on KIRSTY, but in the last moment before the fatal stab KIRSTY twists, avoiding the blow. JULIA shrieks and stumbles forward, the knife gleaming as it's buried to the hilt in her side. KIRSTY slips from between them. JULIA collapses into FRANK's arms. He holds her up. KIRSTY makes a dive for the front door, but FRANK lets JULIA slip and intercepts KIRSTY. JULIA falls back against the wall, dying. KIRSTY retreats to the bottom of the stairs. FRANK follows.
FRANK: You're not leaving now -
JULIA: Help me, Frank. For God's
JULIA: No, Frank -
FRANK: Where are you, beautiful?
FRANK: ( somewhere below ) Where are you, honey?
FRANK: Come to Daddy.
KIRSTY: ( a whisper ) What are you doing here?
STEVE: Got in downstairs. Looking for you. What's going on? You forgot something -
STEVE: You forgot something -
STEVE: ( signalled more than spoken ) I'll go first -
KIRSTY: God -
FRANK: Don't cry for him. He's dead. He always was. Go on. Kill me. I don't care.
KIRSTY: Go on. Kill me. I don't care.
FRANK: Poor baby.
KIRSTY: You bastard
FRANK: Hush now. It's all right. Frank's here.
KIRSTY: That's right. Are you losing your mind, baby? This is Frank you're talking to. FRANK. What's going on? Frank -
FRANK: That's right. Are you losing your mind, baby? This is Frank you're talking to. FRANK. What's going on? Frank -
FRANK: What's going on? Frank -
CENOBITE: Frank -
KIRSTY: ( to Cenobite ) What took you so long?
FEMALE CENOBITE: We had to hear it from his own lips -
FRANK: You set me up! You bitch. You set me up!
CENOBITE: ( to Kirsty ) This isn't for your eyes.
CENOBITE: ( to Kirsty )
FRANK: The house is growling from basement to eaves now, as KIRSTY steps onto the landing.
KIRSTY: We have to get out of here. They'll kill us for the fun of
FEMALE CENOBITE: Don't leave us yet -
FEMALE CENOBITE: We've got such sights to show you -
FEMALE CENOBITE: . don't . Jesus Christ.
STEVE: ( behind Kirsty ) Jesus Christ.
JULIA: Kirsty .
KIRSTY: KIRSTY takes a step towards her, but as she does so the veil rises of its own accord, and the chattering CENOBITE is beneath. KIRSTY slams the box closed. The CENOBITE howls, and disappears. STEVE heads for the door. Turns the handle. As he does so, KIRSTY realizes there's one piece of the box unfinished.
KIRSTY: Too late. He turns the handle. The door is flung open, and THE ENGINEER, clinging to the sides of the door, swings down into the hallway. STEVE is flung backwards against KIRSTY. The box falls from KIRSTY's hand. The beast moves to bite at STEVE, who scrambles out of the way, leaving KIRSTY in the front line. The box lies between KIRSTY and THE ENGINEER, which now uses its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her, its legs still bracing it in the door. She snatches for the box. THE ENGINEER, its mouth oozing fluids, almost catches her arm. Again, she tries. This time one of its arms seizes hold of KIRSTY and drags her towards its jaws. Behind KIRSTY, STEVE snatches up a piece of plaster and flings it in THE ENGINEER's face. It momentarily relaxes its grip on KIRSTY, who slides her hand from its hold and claims the box. She now has slime on her fingers. The box defies her manipulations.
STEVE: Come on! Come on!
KIRSTY: Shit. Shit. Shit.
FRANK: Come to Daddy!
KIRSTY: ( quietly ) Not tonight.
