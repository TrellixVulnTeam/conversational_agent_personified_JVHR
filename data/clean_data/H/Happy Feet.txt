HAPPY FEET: Written by George Miller Screenplay by John Collee
SPACE: Distant STARS, with vast tracts of darkness stretching between them. Move in on OUR SUN, dwarfed in the immense cosmic ocean.
PLANET EARTH: The spinning blue marble. FADE IN: A strange cacophony of MUSIC, growing louder as the familiar CONTINENTS revolve below us and we spiral down onto
ANTARCTICA: THE ICE SHELF Vast, pristine, stupendous. Washed with dawn light. A few small BLACK-SUITED FIGURES are moving towards us.
KEEN MALE: ( trying to connect ) "Babe.I got you Babe."
NEXT MALE: ( giving it his all ) "When a man loves a woman."
WISHFUL: "Love me tender love me true, all my dreams fulfil.
MUMBLE: First rule of survival: get yourself laid before winter.
WISHFUL: Safe home baby..
THE DARKNESS: Wind comes shreiking across the ice shelf to where THOUSANDS OF MALES are huddled, ice crusting on their feathers.
LEAD VOICE: When all others leave.
CHORUS: We Remain.
LEAD VOICE: When the Sun vanishes.
CHORUS: We Remain.
CARUSO: Deny the pangs of hunger. Seal the gaps. Share the warmth..
OUTSIDE: WINDWARD PENGUINS peel off and walk around to the leeward side. WISHFUL is among them
CARUSO: ..Each one taking his turn to defy the

FRIENDLY PENGUIN: Shh. Quiet
MUMBLE: ( looks up ) So What happens now, Dad?
WISHFUL: We Wait
THE ICE: A LONG LINE of male penguins, thousands of them, all with their chicks, stand staring expectantly across the ice shelf. At the front, we find WISHFUL and MUMBLE, who is jiggling with anticipation, hopping from one foot to the other.
MUMBLE: Is she coming soon?
WISHFUL: Any day now.
MUMBLE: Tell me again what she's like
WISHFUL: ( sings ) a wiggle when she walks, a giggle when she talks, makes my world go round..

WISHFUL: Well tell em don't.
MUMBLE: But Why Dad?
WISHFUL: `Cos it ain't penguin.
LATER: MIST rises off the ice shelf. The males are still waiting with their chicks. Over this: The sound of Chicks crying. MUMBLE between his father's feet, follows his father's concentrated gaze.
MUMBLE: Gee I'm hungry
WISHFUL: Everyone's hungry son. The mommas are bringing fish soon.
MUMBLE: What's fish look like.
WISHFUL: You'll see it when she brings one
STILL LATER: The baby penguins are HOWLING now. Anxious fathers lean forward, peering into the distance. Out of the thickening mist, a cluster of little BLACK DOTS The distant females look exhausted as they totter unsteadily across the ice towards their partners. The MALES break ranks and rush towards the distressed females.
PENGUIN LOOKOUTS: .Wives-ho! Wives-ho! .Hubba-hubba! Wives-ho! .Better late than never.
MALE PENGUINS: .Peggy Sue!
WISHFUL: NORMA J.?!

MUM!!: THE GREAT COMMUTE The ICE-SHELF is as busy as a freeway at peak hour with males and females are hurrying BACK AND FORTH from the sea.
THE CRECHE: An efficient, caring TEACHER is giving a lesson to a class of about thirty young chicks grouped in front of her.
TEACHER: Settle class. Settle. We will begin with the most important lesson you will ever learn. Now does anyone know what that is?
MICK: Don't eat yellow snow?
TEACHER: True but, that's not it. Mumble?
MUMBLE: Swimming? Catching Food?
TEACHER: Anyone else?
ELLA: It's our Heartsong, Miss.
TEACHER: Your Heartsong. Yes. The melody you hear inside, the thing that makes you different from every other penguin. So. Let's all be very still now and listen. And when you hear your song, let it come out. Who's first.
MICK: Me! Me! I've got one! "I can't get no.satisfaction.. I can't get no.girly action."
TEACHER: Well Michael, if you think that's really you. What have you got for us, Ella?

WISHFUL: Well Yeah, it was a kinda.a tough winter I guess, and he did hatch a little late, Is there really nothing we can do?
TEACHER: Of course there is. Thats why we have Mrs Astrakhan.
MRS ASTRAKHAN'S: Some distance from the creche, MUMBLE stands with MRS ASTRAKHAN, a Russian-accented remedial teacher.
MRS ASTRKHAN: CAN'T SINK? Rubbeesh. Every little pengvin has a sonk. Vhen I have feenished, your singink vill be givink everyone the goosepeempel.

MRS ASTRAKHAN: Hokay. Enough. Stop. Hokay! Ve go back to the top. Forget the body, look inside the soul. No notes, no sonk, only feelink. Happy feelink. Sad feelink. Enormous feelink, so enormous it fills the whole body. It must escape or you explode! Now, open your leetle beak.
MUMBLE: Its tough when you realise you'll never fit in. Plus I was beginning to moult
THE EDGE: Before him, a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with broken eggs and bits of feather. There are very few penguins here and the ones he can see are all, frankly, weird. A Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to himself. Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around himself like a straightjacket. A troubled Penguin sings angrily."There's no business like show business. CU on Mumble. As he looks back to the sanctuary of the colony and then back out over the wasteland
MUMBLE: Not the nicest place in the world but at least you could do what you liked here.
SKUA: Hey, whacha doin' dere flipperbird?

FIRST SKUA: Hey, Don't peck me or I'll peck you and when I peck you know you've been pecked.( fade )
THE CRECHE: MUMBLE stands some distance back from where the other young penguins are taking school lessons.
MUMBLE: Time passed. We all grew up
TIME LAPSE: As the class transforms into moulting adolescents
CARUSO: Graduates, today you leave the safety of our community for the first time, forsaking the trusted solid ice for the terrible magic of the deep.
CARUSO: Excelsi-yah! Yah yah yah!
MASSED GRADUATES: Excelsi-yah ! Yah yah yah!
MUMBLE: Dad, Ma, can I go with the others
MUMBLE: Dad? I'll learn to sing later. I'll find my voice out there. In the deep. Truly.

MUMBLE: Whatcha waiting for? It's fantast.( splosh )
ELLA: Go Mumble!
MUMBLE: I had an instinct I'd be good at this. Actually we all were. We were the best.
UNDERWATER: Transformed into creatures of grace and exuberance, they swoop and dive trailing plumes of bubbles. Over this: the music of THE BEACH BOYS.
BEACH BOYS: "Suntanned bodies and the waves of Those California girls and the beautiful In the warmed up weather, let's get together and do it again."
THE SURFACE: Skidding out of control, they COLLIDE, ending up in a breathless heap on top of each other.
ELLA: They scramble to their feet.but the ice is slippery.They clutch together, slipping and sliding.
MUMBLE: They scramble to their feet.but the ice is slippery.They clutch together, slipping and sliding.
ELLA: I've got you! No I don't.
MUMBLE: I've got you! No I don't.
MALE PENGUIN: Hi Ella.
MALE PENGUINS: .Where da get to? .there you are! "In the warmed up weather, let's get together and do it again."
UNDERWATER: A half dozen of them gambolling together, their bubble trails Then everyone freezes as a few silvery FISH swim past.
BEACH BOYS: "In the warmed up weather, let's get together and do it again."
MUMBLE: They all zero in. Collisions, barging, a bit like water polo when the ball is first thrown in. In an instant.all the fish are taken.

MUMBLE: This stops the whole thing dead. ELLA pads over to him.
ELLA: ( gently ) Mumble, the thing is.
MUMBLE: I know. I know
ELLA: ..It's better if you just listen.
MUMBLE!!!: ( retreating ) OK! I'll quit. OK!
MUMBLE: ( retreating ) OK! I'll quit. OK!
TIME LAPSE: As night slowly pales to a misty dawn and Mumbles lonely floe drifts off, turning slowly in the current Music Over: "The tracks of my tears"
MORNING: He is woken by A NUDGE at his little raft of ice.
MUMBLE: ( sleepily ) Woah. Whose there.

FURTHER ON: A strange cacophony building as The four ADELIE AMIGOS and MUMBLE crest the rise, to see.
ADELIE LAND: A vast, boisterous ADELIE PENGUIN COMMUNITY. Thousands of them, stretching as far as the eye can see. Its very Rio, very samba, worlds away from the sedate Emperor colony.

MUMBLE: .there was so much to do, so much to
THE ADELIES: ..Addidas amigos!
UNDERWATER: The Adelies shoot back up to the surface. Mumble sinks, slightly dazed, watching the kalaeidescope patters of the surface recede. Music Over: "Ground Control to major Tom"
ADELIES: .Where's the tall-boy .I thought he was with you.
UNDERWATER: Mumble keeps sinking, down down down into a great cathedral- like space, lit by eerie shards of underwater light.
MUMBLE: ..stuff down there beyond my wildest

LOVEDAY'S MOUND: MUMBLE and the ADELIE AMIGOS are bunched together, near the head of a LONG QUEUE of Adelies each with a stone or in their At the head of this queue stands LOVEDAY - guardian of a huge pile of pebbles. His head pokes through one of the rings a PLASTIC SIX-PACK CAN HOLDER festooned with seaweed like a

ADELIELAND: Most of the Adelies are sitting on nests. The Adeleies and Mumble trek past them a protective mother takes a peck at
MOTHER: .Not so close. We got babies on board
ADELIES: .Wow. Does nesting make em touchy
THE ADELIES: .LOVEDAY, you okay?? .what happened .Too much boom-boom for one penguin?
MUMBLE: Just one question! And I want a straight answer! Where do I find the Mystic
AN ADELIE: Why don't he speak?
ADELIES: .He's possessed! .It's a seizure!
MUMBLE: No. He's choking! The Talisman's gotten way too tight.
THE ADELIES: .Why din' you say so? .Hold on we gonna take it off. .You pull that side, I pull this side.
MUMBLE: Stop. You're hurting him.
AN ADELIE: Any better?
THE ADELIES: .It not gonna come off. .Of course it's not! It's sacred!
MUMBLE: LOVEDAY, where did you get it?
THE ADELIES: .It was bestowed on him. .By the Mystic Beings!
MUMBLE: They didn't bestow it on you?
THE ADELIES: .Poor Guy. .He don't know what he's saying.
MUMBLE: If it wasn't bestowed, what happened?
THE ADELIES: .Oh, this one's easy. .He swam.. .On his Hectic Journey of Delightenment. .To the Forbidding Shore.
MUMBLE: And then..?
AN ADELIE: .Well to me that's gotta be bestowing.
MUMBLE: You looked up and.. It just got caught around your neck?
ADELIES: .No way. No. He's the revered one .He speaking symbolically.
MUMBLE: ( gently ) Loveday, did you ever meet a Mystic Being? Really?
AN ADELIE: Oh my! Now he thinks he's an Elephant
MUMBLE: The forbidden place is over the
LOVEDAY: A MOUNTAIN RIDGE The Adelies labour uphill into the wind. LOVEDAY is lagging behind, breathing hard. Even MUMBLE and the AMIGOS are puffing with the effort of the Music Over: He aint heavy he's my brother.
ADELIES: .Stop. Enough. We must've gone past it .Past? Don't kid me. We're not even
MUMBLE: Hear that?!
THE ADELIES: .Refresh my memory do elephant seals eat .No, no.jus' krill and fish. .Sure of your facts are you? Well I guess we're about to find out
ADELIES: Well I guess we're about to find out
MUMBLE: Excuse me, we need directions.to the Forbidden Shore.
MUMBLE: We're looking for the Mystic Beings
MUMBLE: Aliens, the ones who made this.
MUMBLE: Could they be taking our fish?
MUMBLE: But If your grandpappys saw them and they survived, maybe they're not so fierce.
SEAL #1: You calling me a liar son?
SEAL #2: He's calling your grandpappy a liar. And you know what, Maybe he's right.
SEAL#1: Why you. Flop over here and say that!
MUMBLE: Come on Loveday, lets go
ADELIES: ( running to catch up ) .Go where? .didn't you hear what he said .Its Forbidden
MUMBLE: They don't know. They've never been there
AN ADELIE: Stop! I'm hearing voices. The mystical guys. They say: "Your life is perfectly good as it is.forget this stupid mission".
ANOTHER ADELIE: Ramon. That was embarrassing, man.
MUMBLE: So we walked . and walked .. and kept walking. Over the hills and into Blizzard .Oh man! This is no place for a penguin! .We should be migrating out to sea by
THE ADELIES: .Oh man! This is no place for a penguin! .We should be migrating out to sea by
MUMBLE: We need to huddle!
THE ADELIES: Form a moving circle! Share the cold, share the warmth!
MUMBLE: Form a moving circle! Share the cold, share the warmth!
THE ADELIES: .Oh yeah, nice. .That's definitely better. .Good call big guy.
MUMBLE: I said a circle!
AN ADELIE: .No, no. This can't be right! .It was better the other way.
THE ADELIES: .What happened to the Huddle?!
MUMBLE: ( shouts back ) Just keep moving! Toboggan, if you have .Oh no, now I got chest pain .tell you, this is a good way to get snow blind
THE ADELIES: .Oh no, now I got chest pain .tell you, this is a good way to get snow blind
MUMBLE: You think this is it? The Forbidden
ADELIES: ..The way I feel": the "frostbitten" ..So what are those black things?.
MUMBLE: Hello?! Is there anyone out there? .No need to shout. .Yeah, somebody might hear you. .I think we seen all there is to see round here.
THE ADELIES: .No need to shout. .Yeah, somebody might hear you. .I think we seen all there is to see round here.
MUMBLE: What is it?
MUMBLE: They must be here somewhere. They wouldn't leave all this stuff lying Maybe they invisible.
AN ADELIE: Maybe they invisible.
FURTHER ON: They've reached the edge of the sea-ice. LOVEDAY croaks a warning. He points out to sea.
AN ADELIE: What is that?
MUMBLE: A whale?
AN ADELIE: As long as it's a good whale, not the other kind.
ANOTHER ADELIE: What other kind?!!
MUMBLE: The ones with teeth!!
THE ADELIES: .Swim for it!
MUMBLE: No!! Stay on the ice pad where its safe
THE ADELIES: .You call this safe amigo? .Maybe we should split up. .You split up I'm staying right here.
MUMBLE: ( stops )
LOVEDAY! LOVEDAY!!: He swims back. The KILLER WHALE is about to take them both in one bite. MUMBLE pulls LOVEDAY aside, but he's not quite quick enough: one of the Whale's outer teeth catches LOVEDAY by the SIX-PACK PLASTIC and he is DRAGGED AWAY, tethered to the KILLER WHALE like Captain Ahab. The WHALE thrashes around wildly trying to dislodge the hapless little penguin until.
ICE SHELF: MUMBLE and LOVEDAY scramble onto the ice exhausted. Wondering where the next attack will come from, the AMIGOS huddle nearby. Suddenly the ICE SHELF CRACKS OPEN and the KILLER WHALE soars right over the top of them It hits the water but does not stop, just keeps going right on out to sea. The Penguins have no time to reflect on their good fortune. Theres an EARTH SHATTERING NOISE behind them . Turning they see a vast BLACK SHAPE, a hundred feet high, coming at them through the fog. The ADELIES flee across the ice. MUMBLE stands transfixed by the BIG BLACK SHIP towering above him. On the deck he sees
MUMBLE: The pack-ice is BUCKLING AND EXPLODING ahead of the GREAT
WE.HAVE.TO.TALK!: He chases after the ship. THE ADELIES chase after Mumble.
THE ADELIES: .AMIGO-O-O-O! .LET IT GO-O-O-O-O!!
THE ICEBERG: Beyond the last of the ice floes is THE WORLD'S TALLEST ICEBERG. MUMBLE hurls himself onto it and starts scrambling up its precipitous sides. THE ADELIES follow, struggling to keep up.
THE SUMMIT: MUMBLE's POV: THE BIG BLACK SHIP has joined TWO OTHERS about a mile away. The Adelies join him.
THE ADELIES: .You found them, you found Aliens! .Now we go back tell everybody who's taking the fish.
MUMBLE: They've stopped!
LOVEDAY: Mumble. I owe you my life amigo. And I say this because I admire and deeply respect you. If you are thinking what I think you are thinking. You are out of your crazy head
MUMBLE: Say Hi to Ella for me
ADELIES: You say Hi. Come back and say Hi to her
MUMBLE: Oh. One other thing. You guys
ADELIES: Suddenly, MUMBLE turns to the precipice and runs as fast as he can.
MUMBLE: Excelsi yah!!!
WIDE SHOT: The tiny penguin soaring off the top of the ICEBERG. THE ADELIES rush to the edge as, far below Mumble HITS THE WATER. And vanishes.
THE ADELIES: .can you believe that .brought us all this way and killed .no he didn't! look!
LOVEDAY: You don't think we should go with him
ADELIES: .Don't sweat it Revered One. Many are called, few are chosen.
LOVEDAY: About this Revered One stuff, you guys
AN ADELIE: Maybe just call me Pedro
LOVEDAY: Maybe just call me Pedro
LATER: He's getting closer. The ships are only half a mile away when Something rises from the deep, threatening to engulf him: a
MUMBLE: ( yells )
OPEN OCEAN: The SEAS are MOUNTAINOUS. There is no sign of the ship now, nor of land. MUMBLE swims up the side of each wave, over its foaming crest and down into the deep dark valley below.
LATER: The air is full of spray. Choking, MUMBLE ducks under the Its peaceful here. Then something moves beside him and turns with a start to see: A MASSIVE EYE!! A BLUE WHALE entirely fills his field of vision. It sings a few booming Wagnerian notes. Its voice is almost deafening.
UNDERWATER: Its peaceful here. Then something moves beside him and turns with a start to see: A MASSIVE EYE!! A BLUE WHALE entirely fills his field of vision. It sings a few booming Wagnerian notes. Its voice is almost deafening.
MUMBLE: Too loud.
ALBATROSS: He's looking for a mate, mate. And these days, I tell you they're few and far
MUMBLE: The Convergence?
ALBATROSS: Where the cold water meets the warm, mate. Once you cross it, there's no getting' back. What you tryinmg to prove I'm trying to talk to the Aliens!
MUMBLE: I'm trying to talk to the Aliens!
ALBATROSS: The who?
MUMBLE: On the black iceberg. The ones taking all the fish!
ALBATROSS: Them. Fish is just the start of it Mate. Them aliens is the ones who took out the They kill whales! That's impossible
MUMBLE: They kill whales! That's impossible
ALBATROSS: Straight up mate. Biggest creatures ever lived. Decimated, mate.
MUMBLE: So if I wanted to talk to them, where would I go
ALBATROSS: Anywhere and everywhere. Over the sea, under the sea, Jees, I've even seen them fly. The great southland's swarming with Where's that. Do you think the Whale would take me there?
MUMBLE: Where's that. Do you think the Whale would take me there?
ALBATROSS: No way mate, he won't go anywhere near `em. And neither should you.
THE CONVERGENCE: We see from above, the BLUE WHALE turning as well, changing course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the water stretching in a line, as far as the eye can see. MUMBLE swims RIGHT ACROSS THE LINE.
ENDLESS SKY: A 747 drones across the screen, eastwards into the night.
DARKNESS: I woke in darkness. Unable to move. Was I dead? And if I was dead, where was that light coming from
MUMBLE: I woke in darkness. Unable to move. Was I dead? And if I was dead, where was that light coming from
PENGUIN HEAVEN: Bright BLUE SKY, sparkling WHITE CLIFFS OF ICE.
MUMBLE: Wow. They brought me home Excuse me, where are we.
PENGUIN: Heaven. Where d'you think?
MUMBLE: Oh. So we're dead. Right
PENGUIN: Dunno. Don't care. We got food. We got water. You hear a seal now and then, but you never meet one. Perfect.
MUMBLE: ( CONTINUED )
PENGUINS: Fish time. Fish time!
RAINING FISH!: MUMBLE ( VO )
UNDERWATER: Fish hit the surface and sink
MUMBLE: Sometime you got a live one but there was nowhere really to chase it
MUMBLE: ( yells at the aliens ) What have you done to my wing! This is not my home! I want to get out of here!
SPECTATORS GALLERY: Most of the specators are leaving but one young girls stops and stares
YOUNG GIRL: Look Mommy! It's dancing!
PENGUIN ENCLOSURE: Mumble, woken from his reverie, looks up and sees her looking at him.
MUMBLE: What? What did I do?
PENGUIN #1: Oh-Oh, another one gone troppo
PENGUIN #2: You think its infectious
PENGUIN #3: I sure hope not
NEXT DAY: The Gallery is packed. Mumble keeps dancing
NEXT DAY: Theres a riot going on up there. People fighting to get a view. Newspaper reporters, TV cameras. The other penguins in the enclosure have moved back, giving Mumble more space. Every specattor is focussed on him. Mumble is focussed on the spectators.
PENGUINS: .Is it a Penguin? .Is it one of ours?
LATER: Mumble approaches the two sentries. The colony is much diminished: only small groups scattered here and there.
MUMBLE: Hi, where is everybody!?
PENGUINS: Who wants to know?
MUMBLE: I used to live here. When's the Great
PENGUINS: This is it. I guess
MUMBLE: This is all that's left?
PENGUINS: . So Who's this? .Kinda small for an emperor. .( suspicious ) Where did you say you were
ELLA: Mumble?! Its Mumble!!
MUMBLE: Ella! Is it you. You haven't changed a
ELLA: They're my singing students.

ELLA: ( CONTINUED )
MUMBLE: I know who's been taking our fish! I made contact with Aliens! They're coming here. Right behind me.
PENGUINS: .Who's doing all the shouting .Its Mumble. He's worse than before.
MUMBLE: No, honestly Aliens will be here soon! You have to believe me. We came in a big hollow bird and they landed on the ice
MUMBLE: But its true!!
ELLA: So who fixed him up with this.
PENGUINS: .Does it hurt? ..Its not made of feathers thats for .what's it gonna do
MUMBLE: It's so they can find me. That's them now. Listen. You led them here. Are you crazy!!
CARUSO: You led them here. Are you crazy!!
MUMBLE: You said they didn't exist.
CARUSO: They'll slaughter us. Head for the sea!
MUMBLE: No. Do this. Do Happy feet.
MUMBLES: Its what they understand. They can't talk, they can't sing. They speak with their feet. Do it.
PENGUINS: .its the end of the world. ..Its all Mumbles fault. I told you
WISHFUL: Just do what the kid says.
CARUSO: Recite the wisdoms! "Together we stand". "Divided We Freeze".
MUMBLE: Come on, everyone! Happy Feet! It's our only chance!

MRS ASTRAKHAN: ( dancing ) Know him? He ees my star pupol!
CHAIRMAN: .So what do you reckon?
EXPERT: Yes, quite extraordinary. ( stares at the screen ) some kind of neurological disorder? a nutritional deficiency perhaps. We'd certainly back the long-term study.
CHAIRMAN: And the international treaty?
DELEGATE#1: Yes. This is exactly the leverage we need for an embargo. No fishing whatsoever.legal, illegal, sanctioned, So we all step up policing of the pirate factory ships. And we pressure that country to stop their so-called `experimental' fishing.
DELEGATE#2: So we all step up policing of the pirate factory ships. And we pressure that country to stop their so-called `experimental' fishing.
DELEGATE#3: Yes, if our government asks your government to approach their government to call off their fleet.
DELEGATE#2: Better if their government hear it from our government via your government.
CHAIRMAN: What the heck. The amount of publicity this is generating, they'd have world war three if they didn't stop.
THE COLONY: In the confusion of penguins we find MUMBLE, ELLA and their As we watch, Ella moves off, joining the great to and fro of penguins along the highway to the sea.
SPACE: Still pulling back Keep pulling back from the world, the solar system, the Further back. Our galaxy is framed in something like a bomb-
VOICE#1: Is there a problem? I thought this one was barren.
VOICE#2: More or less. But one of the stars we're harvesting supports these things here.
VOICE#1: Well. Exactly. But what we didn't know about before was these things here
VOICE#2: Well. Exactly. But what we didn't know about before was these things here
VOICE#1: Hmm. Charming
VOICE#2: So. We go ahead. Or.?
VOICE#1: No. Better leave them be. See what sector twelves got to offer instead.
