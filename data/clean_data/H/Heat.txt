HANNA: He gonna show? Or the son of a bitch gonna stand her up like last time?
JUSTINE: (starting out of bed) Want the coffee?
HANNA: I'm out of time...
JUSTINE: Falls back on the pillow, disappointed. It's as if she'd been stood-up. The bed sheet falls half off of her. She's exposed, vulnerable. She looks out the window, occluded by light muslin, away from us and exhales.
CERRITO: You Waingro?
WAINGRO: Yeah.
WAINGRO: (continuing loud) You're Cerrito huh? (pause) What kinda guy is this Neil?

NATE: (laughs) You know who these belong to?
NEIL: (takes manila envelope) "Malibu Securities ...
NATE: You know John Van Zant?
NEIL: No.
NATE: Malibu Securities is a brokerage he controls. Planned bankruptcies, made out during the S&L's, money laundering...
NATE: (continuing; laughs) You ripped off his Treasury Certificates.
NEIL: So what?
NATE: That's the point. On top of collecting his insurance, maybe he wants to buy back his bonds. From him I can get you 60 cents on the dollar instead of 40. Means an extra 320 to you.
NEIL: Try it on.
NATE: You know Cezar Kelso?
NEIL: By reputation.
NATE: He's got this score he's putting out and wants you to look at.

DRUCKER: According to the janitor, he... (Guard Two outline) Started mouthing off to one of the gunmen.
HANNA: Oh, that was smart.
DRUCKER: I figure the other went for... (points) ... that gun when the shooting started. One guy called a guard "slick."
HANNA: "Slick?"
DRUCKER: Yeah.   And they ignored the loose cash.
BOSKO: What's the vibe: home-grown or out-of-town?
HANNA: Out-of-town. Frankly, I hope they are scoring once and passing through. And I doubt it.
HEINZ: This going to stay in Area?
HANNA: This look like boosters working the local Seven Eleven to you? It goes to Major Crime. (to his crew) Go to work.

CHARLENE: Eight thousand dollars?   You gotta be kidding me!
CHRIS: (off-handed) I squared the bookies and we had to pay off some guy and were short to start 'cause the rest is comin', in a coupla days. So don't sweat it. (checks watch) We're late.
CHARLENE: Listen to me. "As The World Turns" can get interrupted with a news flash of you splattered all over the street ...
CHARLENE: (continuing; running on) I can get sent up on an accessory beef. Your son, Dominick, winds up in a home. For $8,000? (voice breaks) Honey, for $8,000, it ain't worth the risk. Risk versus reward? Baby?
CHRIS: Don't worry about money. Neil's got... (checks watch) Hey, if we're goin', let's go.
CHARLENE: Where's the club you were going to open?
CHRIS: Here comes the "showgirl with a future" bit.
CHARLEJ: Shut up! I left for a good thing. (beat) Why am I even talking to you? I can't talk to you. All you are is a child growin' older...
CHRIS: The hell's that mean?
CHARLENE: It means we're not making forward progress like real adults and you won't listen.
CHRIS: I told you: me and Neil got planned ...
CHARLENE: "Me and Neil." I'm married to you, now. This isn't the fucking joint.

CASALS (V.O.): No.
HANNA: Hi.
JUSTINE: Where have you been?
HANNA: Work. Harvey show or'd Lauren get stood up again?
JUSTINE: He didn't even call her.
HANNA: What an asshole. She okay?
JUSTINE: She's been in her room all day and won't talk. So "no," she's not okay. And neither am I. (even tempered) If I try to create something like a mood between us you back away. I made a great dinner for us. That was four hours ago. (beat) At least get yourself a plate...
HANNA: There's three dead bodies in an alley off Adams. (beat) I'm really sorry the lamb got overcooked.
HANNA: Looking after her is tired. Very tired. He doesn't know why he said what he did. He regrets it. So he turns on his TV to watch the news and his eyes glaze over.
EADY: What do you do?
NEIL: (looks at her, then away) Swimming pools. Institutional. Schools, State, counties. I'm on the sales end.

NEIL: (continuing) Tell me.
EADY: There's a Skira edition of Delacroix charcoal sketches, I like...
NEIL: What else?
EADY: Asian art work.
EADY (V.O.): The plates are mezzotints. They evoke a feeling Japanese painters called "sabi". They believed there were eight scenes of transcendental loneliness. They painted them over and over again. One is a flock of geese hovering over a field. There's always mist. It's painted just as the leader touches down.
NEIL: City of lights.
EADY: Yeah.
NEIL: I flew over the arctic once at 40,000 feet. The moonlight was blue on all the snow. It felt like that.
EADY: Do you travel a lot?

EADY: Are you lonely?
NEIL: I'm alone.    Not lonely.
NEIL: (continuing) You?

ALBERT: Mon, I go
HANNA: Be there!
CEZAR: I picked you out to pitch it to first, but don't think you're the only action in town and I'm giving it away. 'Cause I'm not.
NEIL: What is it?
CEZAR: A bank. On Thursdays it gets cash deposits for distribution to other branches. The branches have to buttress their cash accounts to handle Friday payroll checks from a Toyota and Nissan plant, a steel mill and two refineries. One day a week, Thursday, the main branch carries the full whack.
NEIL: You want a $100,000 advance, against a full 101. Why?

HUGH: (incredulous) You gonna deal with these people?
VAN ZANT: So word hits the streets it's okay to steal my stuff? I'm gonna kill the sonsa-bitches.
NEIL: I bought it.
NATE: What I tell you?
NEIL: The bonds?
NATE: We're on. You call him tomorrow... (gives slip paper) ... and set a meet.
NEIL: How is he?
NATE: Very cool.   He's a businessman.

VOICES: ...Happy anniversary to you. Happy anniversary dear Michael and Elaine. Happy anniversary to you.
NEIL: (loud over water) We'll down platinum through Nate. The deal is 72% of today's quote on the Bourse in the New York Times.
CERRITO: (loud over water) You got the black boxes for the alarms?
CHRIS: (loud over water) Yeah. Towner delivered.   They're in the drop.
NEIL: (loud over water) We pass by couple times tomorrow afternoon. Check nothing strange in the neighborhood. Tomorrow night: we take it down. You set on the rear door.
CHRIS: (loud over water) I'm going to punch it... (beat) What do we do about Van Zant?
NEIL: (loud over water) Kill him...after the score.
CHRIS: (loud) Kelso?
NEIL: (loud) We'll use Nate's advance off the platinum when I down the merch to pay Kelso for the bank package.
CHRIS: (quietly) You okay?
CHARLENE: I'm fine.
CHRIS: (arm around her) Makin' it happen this time...
CHARLENE: I hope so.    I really hope so.
MICHAEL: (to Neil) Hey!
CHRIS: Let me have it!
NEIL: (smiles) I got it.
HANNA (O.S.): A goddamn convention.
CASALS (O.S.): Who's "slick?"
DRUCKER: Cerrito, the wide one. He's hugged twice. One if he finds it behind the wheel wall. The back-up's in the firewall. We got their plates.
CASALS: Yeah.
DRUCKER: One with the hair is Shiherlis. Got a revolving tail and a tap on the house phone.
HANNA: (re Neil) Who's the big guy?
DRUCKER: First time we're seeing him.
HANNA: Next time this crew scores? When they walk in that door? They will get the surprise of a lifetime.
NEIL: (holds her close: looks at her face) Come away with me.
EADY: What? (surprised) Where?
NEIL: New Zealand.
EADY: When?
NEIL: Soon.
EADY: You're kidding.
NEIL: What's stopping you?     What's here?
EADY: (laughs) I don't know you.
NEIL: What's to know?
EADY: Are you married?
NEIL: (laughs) Why?
EADY: Way you come and go.
NEIL: I deal with state officials. County. Weird hours. A lot of traveling, entertaining. (beat) The last thing I am is married.
EADY: You don't know me at all, Neil...
NEIL: I know enough.
EADY: My father wanted me to marry someone in Taipei. It was like I was a piece of furniture: "Go be his wife." After I left he won't talk to me. Because I went on my own. I can't let people tell roe what to do again. And that trust comes from knowing someone over time. (avoids Neil) This is hard between us for me. Because I like you very much.
NEIL: I have to leave. Come away with me. (beat) No one will ever tell you what to do... You'll never lose yourself with me.
PROSTITUTE: (tired) Hey, baby.
WAINGRO: Showed you a good time?     Huh?
PROSTITUTE: Oh, yeah.   You fly. You cool.
WAINGRO: Don't lie to me. I can always tell when people lie to me.
PROSTITUTE: I ain't lyin'! You a hot dog. You a cowboy. You hung like a horse and this was the monster fuck of my young life. (pause) Now I gotta get my ass streetside.
WAINGRO: You don't have a truth-telling style.
PROSTITUTE: The fuck's wrong with you?
WAINGRO: (shouts) You think I'm some john? I'm a stone killer! I'm a sky-blue bad ass, bitch!
BARTENDER: (tired smile) Once again?
WAINGRO: (feeling good now) Sure, good buddy. Set it up.
WAINGRO: I'm looking to get into something.
BARTENDER: (smiles) Yeah? Where you been?
WAINGRO: Chino, Tracy. I'm a cowboy, heavy-hitter. Billy Ricketts said to come see you.
BARTENDER: Go see this guy. This guy always putting guys on.
WAINGRO: Thanks.
LILLIAN: (heavy) Get your fucking hand off my arm!
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.): (radio filter) Hey, hey! (beat) ...there, old aware ones, and you, too, my fair ones. When tears are falling like rain the groove is strictly Col-trane...
BREEDAN: Hey!
LILLIAN (O.S.): Let's go, baby.
BREEDAN: I got any left?
LILLIAN: There's other paychecks. You blow it off. It's worth it, baby, cause you mess with that man and you be violated right back to San Quentin. So you got to handle it 'til we get you a different job.
BREEDAN: (energy) Yeah. That motherfucker ain't invented the hard time this gangster can't handle!. (crashes) Why you stickin' with me, Lillian? Why?
LILLIAN: 'Cause I'm proud of you.   Proud you my man.
BREEDAN: (cracks up) Proud of me?
BREEDAN (CONT'D): (beat) What you proud of me for?
LILLIAN: (beat) Come on home.
BRUCE: (into radio) Okay. (to Hanna) Captain Jackson wants to know what's goin' on.
HANNA: (into his radio) Nothing. Clear the air.
JACKSON: (into walkie-talkie) Where'd...they...go?
HANNA: (pissed; into mike) Fell back to see if the alarm bypasses held. If they did, they'll be back. Stay the fuck off the radio!
HANNA: (tense whisper) Quiet! !
NEIL: (he decides; whispers) ...We walk.
CHRIS: (tense whisper; re: the box) I'm 60 seconds away. It's a rat or something.
NEIL: (whispers) It is not an animal sound.   We are out of here.
CHRIS: (tense whisper) We need the cash!!
NEIL: (tense whisper; already going) We walk!! Now.
JACKSON: (into radio; whispered) They're leaving. Why are they leaving?!
JACKSON (O.S.): (radio filter; whispered) I can take 'em, now!
HANNA (V.O.): (radio filter; whispered) Let 'em go.
JACKSON (V.O.): (radio filter) At least we got 'em on a...
HANNA: (cuts him off; into radio) Let em go. We got nothing! Not even a burglary. They didn't fucking steal anything yet. Don't you get it? All we've got's breaking and entry.
JACKSON (V.O.): (radio filter) I'm not letting them walk!
HANNA: The fuck you aren't! That's exactly what you are gonna do. It's my investigation. And my authority supersedes your rank! And I am not settling for some chicken shit misdemeanor!
HANNA: Back to work.
MARCIANO: (rising; big smile) What can I do for you guys? Ignores his hand and shoves him back into his office chair with an open hand.
MARCIANO: L.A.P.D. Who the hell you think you're pushing around? You got no jurisdiction and I know people here!
SCHWARTZ: Who? The fucking Tooth Fairy! So what?
HANNA: You go back to Newark on a New Jersey warrant for smuggling cigarettes up from North Carolina three years ago or you go to work for us. Cut and dried. That...is...it.
MARCIANO: Oh, my God...
HANNA: Charlene Shiherlis.
MARCIANO: Who?
SCHWARTZ: "Who?" The stranger you been talkin' dirty to on the telephone every day for the last month.
MARCIANO: You can't tie me to her!
HANNA: Who has to. You're onna plane to New Jersey, jagoff.
MARCIANO: Oh, man... (to himself) Why did I get mixed up with that bitch?
HANNA: (sits down) 'Cause she's got a great ass and you goT your head all the way up it.
MARCIANO: (defeated) So?
HANNA: So it's no big thing. I don't even want her. You can have her, after. I want her husband and all his buddies; that's all. And you're gonna help.
NEIL: LAPD? The G? What? Where the hell did this heat come from?
CHRIS: Maybe it's only the EMA score, not us.
NEIL: (low) Wake up! (beat) Assume they got our phones, our houses bugged, I beepers on all the cars. We got major problems.. Where's Cerrito?
NEIL (O.S.): Recognize the cook?
CHRIS: No.
NEIL: D Block. San Q. Did a nickel on armed robbery.
NEIL (O.S.): Hey, David.     How you doing?
BREEDAN: Hey, Homeboy! All right! (flips eggs; checks orders) How bout you?
NEIL: (sits on counter) Gettin' by. You okay?
BREEDAN: (embarrassed; re: job) Yeah. Temporary. Know what I mean?
NEIL: Sure.   See you around.
NEIL: (to Cerrito) What took you so long?
CERRITO: (low) My car. Bugs. Two of 'em. Count 'em. One in the wheel well. Second behind the fire wall. Night of the party? I dropped Elaine and swung by EMA to check out the junction box...
CHRIS: Without the platinum how do we buy the bank score?
NEIL: I cash in T-bills to pay-off Kelso. That's not our problem.
CERRITO: What the hell happened to Van Zant and our 750?
NEIL: With the heat we got, you wanna play World War Two in the streets with Van Zant?
CERRITO: Van Zant gets a pass?!
NEIL: Fuck Van Zant. I got more motivation to whack him than you do. He is a luxury. Our problem is: jam and take the bank or split. (beat) And I mean right fucking now. Do not go home, pack, nothing. Thirty seconds from now we are on the road. Gone.
CHRIS: For me, the bank's worth the stretch. I say accept the risk, stay.
NEIL: Michael?
CERRITO: (quietly) I roll with you. Whatever...
NEIL: (quietly) Not on this one, Michael. On this one you make up your own mind.
CERRITO: (he can't) ...you figure this the best thing to do?
NEIL: I got some plans. To go away after. So for me, it's worth the stretch.
NEIL: (continuing) But, Elaine takes good care of you. You got plenty put away. T. Bonds; real estate. If I were you, I'd be smart and cut loose of this.
CERRITO: Hey. To me the action's half the juice anyway. I'm in.
NEIL: All right.   All right.
CERRITO: That the place?
NEIL: Yeah. You see how the road leads back around?
CERRITO: Yeah.
NEIL: That's the escape route...
SCHWARTZ (O.S.): This is it.
CASALS: I know.   Let's go!
HANNA (O.S.): What are they taking down out here?
CASALS: They were looking at something southwest...
HANNA: What's's that down there?
CASALS: An auto parts company. They're going to knock over a payroll?
SCHWARTZ: The company only pays by check.
HANNA: Maybe they're gonna steal the hub caps ...
HANNA: (continuing) A billboard. Oil pumps.     What the hell's goin' on?
SCHWARTZ: That's what we were trying to figure.
HANNA: I got an idea what they're looking at. You know what they're looking at?
HANNA: (continuing; to Schwartz) Is that guy something; or is that guy something? I mean, you gotta give this crew credit. They are so fucking good... (beat) Know what he's looking at?
HANNA: Us. The L.A.P.D. The Police Department. We just got made...
NATE: Worth it?
NEIL: (impressed) There's enough circuit diagrams and blueprints here to build the bank. (beat) It's terrific.
NATE: His name is Hanna; first name, Vincent. I smeared this sergeant in vice five yards. Hanna's all over you. He's a hot dog. Lieutenant in major Crimes Unit. He's taken down some heavy crews. Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago and he was a fucking maniac. Was working Narcotics before that. He's good, Neil. Dedicated. Divorced three times. Current wife's Justine. He's why the extra heat. (pause) Vice sergeant says Hanna likes you. Thinks you're some kind of 'star.' 'You do this sharp, you do that sharp. Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.'
NATE: (continuing) Funny as a heart attack. (pause) With this guy and this much heat, you should pass on the bank.
NEIL: I've had heat before.
NATE: That's not the point.
NEIL: This one's worth the stretch
NATE: You sure?
NEIL: I'm sure.   Drop me at the garage.
HUGH: Hear from him yet?
VAN ZANT: Not a thing.
HUGH: Maybe he went away.
VAN ZANT: (sarcastic) Yeah. Sure. (beat) Not hearing bothers me more... (an afterthought) Where's this guy?
HUGH: (re Waingro) This guy here...we put him on. Turns out he knows McCauley.
WAINGRO: Waingro. My name's Waingro. (smiles)
VAN ZANT: I been living in this office day and night. What's with your friend?
WAINGRO: I know all about how he thinks. We took some major scores together. He's probably busy right now. But he's real thorough. He won't forget you...
VAN ZANT: (wry) That's reassuring.
WAINGRO: Yeah, I got some moves I could make here, that could be a big help to you...
HANNA: Justine?
HANNA: Where we going?
HANNA: (continuing; acid) Where are you going?
JUSTINE: Out.
HANNA: You know I'm on you.    Let's talk.
NEIL: (beat; then) Sure. Buy me a cup of coffee.
HANNA: Seven years in San Quentin. In the hole for three. McNeil before that.
NEIL: Yeah.
HANNA: Was McNeil as tough as they say?
NEIL: You looking to become a penologist?
HANNA: You looking to go back? I chased some crews, the guys were lookin' to fuck up and get busted back.
NEIL: You must have worked some dipshit crews.
HANNA: I worked all kinds.
NEIL: (pause) You see me doing thrill-seeker liquor store holdups with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?
HANNA: No, I do not.
NEIL: Right.   And I...
NEIL (CONT'D): (low threat) I am never going back.
HANNA: Then don't take down scores.
NEIL: I do what I do best. I take scores. You do what you do best trying to stop guys like me. (shrugs)
HANNA: You never wanted a normal-type life?
NEIL: What the fuck is that?    Barbecues and ballgames?
HANNA: That's part of it.
NEIL: That's nice.     That your life?
HANNA: No. My wife spends half her time on the couch. My stepdaughter's got problems 'cause her real father's a world class asshole. And every moment I got, I'm chasing guys like you.
NEIL: A man told me once: you want to make moves? Don't keep anything in your life you're not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner. (pause) So if you're chasing me and you gotta move when I move, how do you expect to keep a family?
HANNA: What are you, a monk?
NEIL: No. (pause) I got a woman.
HANNA: What do you tell her?
NEIL: She thinks I sell swimming pools.
HANNA: And if you spot me around the corner. You gonna walk out on her? Leave her flat? Like that? Not even say goodbye?
NEIL: That's the discipline.
HANNA: What you're left with is pretty empty.
NEIL: Yeah? (beat) Then maybe you and me, we should both go do somethin' else, pal.
HANNA: I don't know how to do anything else.
NEIL: (the shared confession) ...neither do I.
HANNA: And I don't much want to.
NEIL: Neither do I.
HANNA: We're sitting here like a coupla regular fellas. You do what you do. I do what I gotta do. What happens if I am there and I got to put you away? (pause) I won't like it. But, if it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're going to make into a widow, brother, you are gonna go down. 'Cause you don't
HANNA (CONT'D): have to be there. You coulda gone and been a... a mailman.
NEIL: There's a flip side to that coin. What if you got me boxed in and I gotta put you down? (beat) 'Cause no matter what, you will not get in my way. (beat) But now that we been face to face, I would not feel good about that. But I won't hesitate. Not for one second.
HANNA: (smiles) Maybe it'll happen that way.    Or who knows ...
NEIL: ...maybe we'll never see each other again.
HANNA: (to waitress) Can we have the bill.
DRUCKER: They dumped us!
HANNA: What?
DRUCKER: They dumped us.
HANNA: I was just with him!
DRUCKER: With who?
HANNA: Whattaya mean, "they dumped us"?!
DRUCKER: Chris slipped his tail.      And Chris doesn't talk about     jobs with Charlene so there's     nothing for Marciano to get from     her.
HANNA: (to Casals) Cerrito?
CASALS: Disappeared. No calls to the house. Not home.
HANNA: Locators on their cars?!
CASALS: (painful) Cerrito dumped his on a UPS van. Surveillance tailed a UPS van to Oxnard.
HANNA: (shouts) They dumped all our tails?!!
CASALS: Yeah.
HANNA: (shouts) I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago. What happened?
CASALS: Our tail saw you. McCauley pulled into a car wash. Car came out. He didn't.
HANNA: Does anybody have Any     idea where the fuck these people     are at? 'Cause whatever they     are gonna do, they are doing it     right now!
NEIL: (whispers) Got it. it's eighteen inches in.
NEIL: Where the hell's Towner? I wanted to pass by early. I want to check the slot for the work car.
SOLENKO: (re: Neil, Chris and Cerrito) How long those guys been sitting back there?
CASHIER: Hour or so...
SOLENKO: (crossing to grill) They think this a hotel?
SOLENKO (O.S.): (tough) Twenty minutes, then I toss their asses out of here.
BREEDAN: (without turning) You spell me? I didn't take my break yet ...
SOLENKO: That spic, Cisco Kid, whatever, didn't show. After the lunch rush, haul out the garbage and mop the back. Take your break later.
CERRITO: Here he is.
TOWNER: Hey!   I'm out! I can't go.
NEIL: What are you talking about?
TOWNER: Anna's got a perforated appendix. We took her to the hospital.
TOWNER (CONT'D): They're operating right now. It's a mess. I got to get back there...
NEIL: What the hell I do for a driver?!
TOWNER: Look, I got her sister there, waiting at the hospital. I came over 'cause I didn't want to talk on the phone. (continuing: rises) I got to get back. Last thing I'd do is let you down, Neil...
NEIL: What do you call this?    Backing me up?
TOWNER: (tense; angry) I waited too long trying to get past today! So now maybe she got peritonitis. (beat) I got to be there...
CHRIS: What the fuck do we do now?
NEIL: Here comes your second chance for a change of luck...
BREEDAN: Yeah?

BREEDAN: Yeah.   When?

NEIL: Out back in five.
SOLENKO: (shouts) Where the fuck you going?
WAINGRO (O.S.): They buy it?
TOWNER: Yeah.
WAINGRO: (buddy-buddy) I got to hand it to you, sport. You're slick, pal smart how you handled all this. On the ball. Yeah.
TOWNER: (wry) Thanks. Where's Anna?
WAINGRO: She's resting. It's going down anyway? On schedule?
TOWNER: That's right.
WAINGRO: (to Hugh) Make the call.
TOWNER: Where's she?
WAINGRO: I dunno.
TOWNER: Know what happens when Neil finds out? To both of us?
WAINGRO: I know what's gonna happen. Nothing's gonna happen. 'Cause I got it master minded. I got it jammed. This is solid. Take it from the kid.
TOWNER: You hope. (pause) What do you mean, you don't know where she is?
TOWNER: (screams) Anna?
WAINGRO: (following; to his back) ...showing her a good time.
NEIL (O.S.): There's the slot.
BREEDAN: Looks right. Come out the door, your angle takes you into the car. Don't have to run around the doors. You want them open?
NEIL: No. 'Cause time is not a problem. And I want nothing to look weird.
BREEDAN: Po-lice response time?
NEIL: There is none.
BREEDAN: Why?
CHRIS: Cause we bypassed all the alarms last night. (continuing) For you this whole gig is a slow cruise down Hawthorne...
NEIL: (with finality) Drop us in the slot.   Let's take it down.

NEIL: ...you people behind the windows: the salaries this bank pays aren't big enough to take risks for, so think of your take-home pay before you risk your life.
NEIL: (to customers - like a commercial) ...don't forget your money is insured by the Federal Government. You're not going to lose a penny. Relax and you'll get through this okay.
NEIL (CONT'D): (nice) Any of the ladies feel ill or anybody with heart trouble wants to sit down, go right ahead.
NEIL: (smiles) The key.
TIMMONS: What key?

NEIL: I'll be back for you.

VKN ZANT (O.S.): Who is it?
NEIL: Waingro.   Where is he?
VAN ZANT: (shouts) How the hell should I know?
NEIL (O.S.): How much?
NEIL (O.S.): That's a rip-off.
NATE: You want   a good getaway and you're hot with   a big score in your pocket.    You're a media event. What the   fuck do you expect?
NEIL: What do I get for those dollars?
NATE: You end up in Ireland with good papers and plastic.
NEIL: Via what?
NATE: Lear jet to Vancouver. Then commercial to Reykjavik; then Dublin.

HANNA: (to Farina) You stick with the Charlene Shiherlis piece.
FARINA: Marciano's on a plane in here from, Las Vegas to pick her up. We got a house I set..
HANNA: Maybe Chris or Neil will come for her. Frankly, I doubt it. (to Drucker; continuing) You work Neil's transport from here on the phones.
DRUCKER: McCauley's gotta be gone. He hadda have a getaway planned.
HANNA: And now he's gotta get a new one! Would you trust it after this afternoon? (beat) Someone, somewhere's agenting it for him. That's a main track. We got Shiherlis setting up. That's a main track. I want more.
FARINA: How much time we got?
HANNA: Eight, ten, twelve hours. For him to set up a new out. After that? He's gone. Bam! Bye- bye.
HANNA: (to Bosko; sarcastic) He's the burglary cop with the "terrific tip?"
BOSKO: Yeah.
DIETER: Who are you?
HANNA: Hanna.   Where'd it come from?
DIETER: (defensive) I got my informants.      Just like you got...
HANNA: (explodes) I got Schwartz. Dead. Casals got no liver. He's dying. Don't come on to me with "confidential source" crap!
DIETER: (shouts) Hugh. Hugh Benny.       He gives me tips...!
HANNA: (shouts) Who ratted-out McCauley?     C'mon! Who? You?
CHARLENE: (screams) Whose side are you on?
MARCIANO: I'm on yours.
CHARLENE: You slimy piece of shit.     What a joke.
MARCIANO: You told me you want out from under? You're scared to death of Neil. You wanted out? This is out!
CHARLENE: What's your end?
MARCIANO: You dump broad! How'd I get into this?
FARINA: Hey, hey!     Go easy on the lady!
MARCIANO: (surprised) Huh?
FARINA: You heard me. She had a rough ride. (beat) Go mix her a drink. Cabinet above the sink.
MARCIANO: Fuck her.
FARINA: Get the fuck in there!
FARINA: (continuing; soft) He's right. And you know it. You think you'd be betraying Chris?
CHARLENE: (right to his face) Yes.
FARINA: Well, you're right. You would be. But if you don't betray Chris, you betray Dominick. Because he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory 'cause you got no living parents to take him. Then he ends up state-raised and fucked for life. Your son Dominick's innocent. He didn't choose a life like that. Chris did.
FARINA: (continuing) Give up Chris. You get off clean. Do it for your kid.
FARINA: (continuing; into cellular phone) Vincent. It's me. We're set here. She'll make the call.
CHARLENE: (into phone) I'm going to give you an address of where I'm staying. Could you get it to Chris?
HANNA: (into phone) Okay.
HANNA: (into phone) It's me. Tracks back to this union guy, Van Zant. He had some beef with Neil. Neil already settled it. Van Zant got dead earlier tonight. (pause) Now Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life and become a born- again good citizen. So, he's revealed the key player is this cowboy Waingro. Used to be part of Neil's crew. Waingro committed a double murder today on Towner, a driver, and his old lady. (pause) Meanwhile Waingro's checked into the Airport Hyatt House under "Jamieson." Maybe Neil will make a move on him, but not likely. (pause) Get the word to bailbondsmen, bookies, snitches in County, etc. where Waingro is. And get a team down there to set it up.
DRUCKER (V.O.): (phone filter) Want me to do it?
HANNA: (into phone) No. You stay on who's agenting Neil's getaway. What have you got?
DRUCKER (V.O.): (phone filter) Nothing yet.
HANNA: (to Berryman) He's here. He's still here.    I can feel it.
BERRYMAN: For how long?
HANNA: Eight, ten hours max.
EADY: (quietly) What did you do? (re TV) Was that you?
NEIL: It's what I don't do. (beat) I don't sell swimming pools. It would have been okay. You would have flown out after. You didn't need to do a thing. Now I'm jammed. We got to go together. Because we get dropped in a place and then I decide: New Zealand or Brazil or Tunisia, whatever. I can't leave a string back here to where I am.
EADY: (confused) What.
NEIL: I rob and steal for a living. Do you understand?
EADY: (amazed) You killed people?
NEIL: If they got in the way.    Yes. It's their problem.
EADY: The woman on the grass...where her husband got shot..
NEIL: Elaine Cerrito. (pause) Michael Cerrito's wife. Michael was my friend. He knew the risks. He didn't have to be there. He coulda been a...been a mailman. (he stops)
EADY: I don't believe it.
NEIL: Believe it.
NEIL: (continuing) Eady. Get packed.     Get dressed. Let's go.
NEIL: (after her) Eady! !
EADY: (explosively hysterical) Why you do this to me!    What I do to you?!
NEIL: Shut up!
NEIL: (soft) Use these credit cards. They say "Mr. and Mrs." I reserved the car. Buy me some clothes. Here's a list. I can't go home for my stuff. Can you do it?
EADY: When's it over?
NEIL: Twenty-two hours. Then we fly out of here...clean.
EADY: I want you to let me go.     When will you let me go?
NEIL: You can go now. There's the door, you want out...
EADY: No, I have to do what you say. But will you let me leave after?
NEIL: It will be different...
JUSTINE (O.S.): (ignorant of Hanna's presence; to Ralph) It's ready...
JUSTINE: (cool) Oh. Meet Vincent.
RALPH: Excuse me. You didn't tell me you were...
RALPH: (continuing) Oh, my God...
HANNA: What's your name?
RALPH: (frozen) I should....Ralph...I'm...
HANNA: I'm Vincent Hanna.
JUSTINE: Don't you even get angry?
HANNA: (to Justine) I'm angry. (to Ralph) Ralph, you can ball my wife. You can lounge around her $1.7 million condominium on her sofa. You can do all those things. But you do not get to watch my fucking TV...!
HANNA: (continuing; to Justine) I've never screwed around. I've been true blue to you since the day we met.
JUSTINE: It would have been preferable if you had! You made me do this!
HANNA: Right I had Ralph fuck you 'cause it makes me feel so good.
JUSTINE: Put down the television. You look ridiculous. (he doesn't) Dr. Prince says I'm trying to get your attention. Christ! I have to pay someone to figure out my life with you.
RALPH: Maybe I should...
HANNA: Shut up!
JUSTINE: Why's it my job to figure it all out and explain it to you?
HANNA: 'Cause you're the one who spends all the time on the couch.
JUSTINE: And what do you do?
HANNA: What do I do? I speak the English language. Words. Sentences even.
JUSTINE: How admirable: proletarian candor.
HANNA: Thank you.
JUSTINE: Except you don't say a damned thing. You neglect me. You don't call. I can worry about you or not. So I withdraw. You don't notice. You're walking through our life chloroformed, Vincent. Wake up. It's almost over.
NATE: I got Cerrito's share deposited in the Delaware Trust for Elaine. She's pretty bad... (pause) Passports. Traveler's checks. Plastic. (hands them over) Hangar 17. Plane call letters are 1011 Sierra. Touches down, holds for five minutes and splits. The plane will stand an FAA check. Filed flight plan. The works.
NATE (CONT'D): (to Chris) Here's the address Charlene said she was at. But I don't have documents for her.
CHRIS: I'm not flying. I'm drivin'.
NATE: (looks at Neil; to Chris) Fly. Send for her later. (to Neil) Can't you talk to him?
NEIL: I been trying.
NATE: (to Neil) Talk to you in three hours in case there's changes.
NEIL: Use the Camaro. Its clean and will stand a DMV check.
CHRIS: How you getting around?
NEIL: Someone's picking me up.
CHRIS: A girl on the side?
NEIL: (laughs) See you, cowboy.
CHRIS: So long, brother.
EADY: (driving) Clothes are in the trunk.
NEIL: Any trouble?
EADY: No.   When's it over?
NEIL: Six hours. 8 p.m.
NEIL: (continuing) I'll buy you lunch. Everything's smooth. We're going to fly away...
FARINA: (into phone) Not a thing. What about you?
HANNA: (into phone) Someone's agenting Neil's stuff?
HANNA (CONT'D): Who? The Tooth Fairy? Talk to you later.
HANNA: (continuing; suddenly to Drucker) ...how did Charlene get the Marina address passed to Chris?
HANNA: (continuing; to Drucker) I don't believe I didn't think of this. (into phone) Farina?
NATE (V.O.): (phone filter) Yeah?
NEIL: (into phone) Hi ya.
NATE (V. 0.): (phone filter) You okay?
NEIL: (into phone) Yeah, Breedan's end?
NATE: (phone filter) Still can't find nobody. It's in the Delaware Trust. You tell me later what to do. And about your ride. No changes. Right on schedule.
NEIL: (into phone) Okay...
NATE (V. 0.): (phone filter) By the by: I heard your pal is checked into the Airport Hyatt under "Jamieson"...if you still care...
NATE (V.O.): (continuing; phone filter) I figured you wouldn't waste the time.
NEIL: (into phone) You figured right. (smiles) Take it easy, old man.
NATE: (phone filter; laughs) You take it easy. Be careful, huh?
NEIL: (to Eady) That was the last bridge.
HANNA: He blows out of here, you'll do his time. I want...
NATE: (shouts back) Screw what you want.    Who the fuck are you?
HANNA: (shouts) Your worst nightmare.    Hard time, Nate!
NATE: (shouts back) I ain't looking at shit, and you know it! So don't con me.
BOSKO: (grabs Nate; to Hanna) I'll work him...
NATE: (shouts at Bosko) Go ahead!
HANNA: (to Bosko) Don't touch him! (to Nate) Accessory. Armed robbery and murder one. Dealing stolen merchandise and securities. You agent for Neil. At least the armored car and bank. Everything I tie him into, I tie you into. Two cops dead. Other bodies on the sidewalk. You understand that kind of heat? You fucking get it!
NATE: Neil who...?
HANNA: (shouts to Drucker) Book him on Accessory to Armed Robbery, Murder One, A.D.W., and Trafficking Stolen Merchandise. (shouts at Nate) The Nazi's in Quentin will turn your ass into a satchel. You're an old man. Gimme Neil!
NATE: (shouts back) What I'll give you is so many false arrest lawsuits, you won't have time to write traffic tickets!
HANNA: Get me Farina.
DRUCKER: Can we put Nate away?
HANNA: With a staff of five or six marshaling physical evidence for six months after two years' worth of continuances...maybe he'll do 18 months. Won't fucking happen. (to Bosko) Check the bait.
BOSKO: Waingro?
HANNA: Yeah.   At the hotel.
NEIL: Look over there.
NEIL: (talks to the back of her) I don't even know how to think like this...cause this has happened to me late in my life. But I got some expectations. For us. You can walk right now if you want. Walk away. Or you...on your own...you choose to come with me. I got enough in there to take care of us for forever.
NEIL: (continuing) Eady.
NEIL: (continuing) Eady?

FARINA: (to Charlene) C'mon, sugar: show yourself
MARCIANO: (to Charlene) Do it!
FARINA: (to Marciano) Shut up!!
FARINA: (continuing) One second at the window.   Then it's all over...
CHARLENE: looks at Farina. She slowly crosses to the window. Marciano has faded to the back of the room.
CHARLENE: (irritated) For Christ's sake...that's not even him. That's not Chris.
CHRIS: (loud; tight) Any of you guys know anything for rent around here?
BASKETBALL PLAYER #1: Alberiz's grocery on Dell Avenue got cards on the wall.
FARINA: (radio filter) Unit two. This is command. Take him at the street. Check him out.
UNIT TWO (V.O.): (radio filter)
MARCIANO: (worried) Where the hell is he?
CHARLENE: (taunts him) Maybe he's not coming.
MARCIANO: (explodes) You better hope he shows! Or you're going to the can, you two dollar...
FARINA: (shouts at cop) Get him the hell out of here!
UNIT TWO (V.O.): (radio filter) Command.
FARINA: (into radio) Yeah?

FARINA: (continuing; to Charlene) Want a cup of coffee while we wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?
CHARLENE: (sad smile) That would be nice.
FARINA (V.O.): (phone filter) False alarm, Lieutenant.
HANNA (V.O.): (phone filter) What's the score?
DESK CLERK/COP: (into phone) On this Waingro?
DESK CLERK/COP (CONT'D): I just told Bosko. Zero. Nothing's happening.
HANNA: You know what? (beat) Neil's gone. Bam!   Flyin' like' a bird.
BOSKO: (jumps up) C'mon! How do you know?   We still got...
HANNA: What do we got? (as if to Neil) Bon voyage, motherfucker, you were good. (low) I'm going to the hotel. I'm gonna take a shower. I'm gonna sleep for a month.

PAINTER TWO: We going to finish this game or what?
OPERATOR (V.O.): (phone filter) Hyatt House.
NEIL: (into phone; familiar) Hi. It's the kitchen again. A... "Jamieson" ordered a BLT and they got his room number screwed up.
OPERATOR (V.O.): (phone filter) They're always doing that. (beat)
NEIL: (into phone) Thanks, love.
PA (V.O.): A fire has been reported. Please leave your rooms now. Proceed down marked fire exits. Use the staircases. Do not use the elevators. This is NOT a drill. A fire...etc.

WAINGRO (O.S.): Yeah?
NEIL: I'm hotel security. We're evacuating the floor.
WAINGRO (O.S.): I can't leave.
NEIL: Sir, I'm afraid you'll have to.

HANNA: (into radio) Casals come in.
CASALS (V.O.): (radio filter) Vincent. I'm in the southeast stairwell.
HANNA: (into radio) What's the situation?
CASALS (V.O.): (radio filter) Three teams are moving up the other three stairwells to the 14th floor. Elevators are out of commission because of the fire alarm. Surveillance said McCauley looked right at 'em. Didn't seem surprised.
HANNA: (into radio) It means he knew we were here and came anyway.
CASALS (V.O.): (radio filter; continuing) I got two Special Weapons Teams deployed at the front and back exits. Choppers.
HANNA: (into radio; interrupts) Yeah, yeah, that's fine.   Stay on it. 10-4.
