PINHEAD: ( echoed Kirsty, come to daddy
RONSON: ( off camera ) Ah, you're awake. Good.
RONSON: Tell you what - we'll make a deal. I'll tell you what I know, then you tell me what you know. O.K.?
RONSON: KIRSTY looks up at RONSON's face and then around at the room.
O.K.?: KIRSTY looks up at RONSON's face and then around at the room.
KIRSTY: Where am I?
RONSON: You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged - it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend. ?
KIRSTY: Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
RONSON: Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
RONSON: What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
KIRSTY: What are you talking about? Who are you?
RONSON: Oh, excuse me.
RONSON: Ronson. Homicide. I'm this district's slash and dash expert. Made a career of the nasty ones. That's why I was at your Dad's house. Jesus, what a mess.
CORTEZ: CORTEZ prods at the corpse with his night-stick, attempting to turn it over. A stream of maggots pours from the mouth and the cavity that used to be its throat. CORTEZ jumps back in disgust and knocks against one of the several wardrobes in the cluttered room. Another corpse flies out at him, as decayed and flvblown as the first. CORTEZ draws his gun and empties it blowing the corpses head off, scattering flesh, mucus, and bone - but no blood - everywhere before realizing it is already dead. He realises what he has done and lowers his weapon sheepishly.
CORTEZ: Oh. shit.
RONSON: We got two missing people and a house full of corpses.
RONSON: Talk to me. I thought Steve had talked to you?
KIRSTY: I thought Steve had talked to you?
RONSON: Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But - do me a favor? - none of this DEMONS crap.
KIRSTY: He talked about Demons, huh?
RONSON: KIRSTY turns her head to look directly at RONSON.
KIRSTY: It's true. All of it. It's all true.
RONSON: 10 INT BEDROOM LODOVICO STREET NIGHT Another OFFICER, KUCICH, is standing, radio in hand, by the blood-stained mattress. CORTEZ stands beside him, gun now safely KUCICH looks at CORTEZ, who looks embarrassed.
KUCICH: Kucich here,sir. We just found another one, though it suffered a little.
KUCICH: .er, accidental damage in discovery. Anyway, just about the only portable evidence we've got here - apart from human remains - is the mattress. Looks like someone was messed up real bad on it.
KUCICH: ( off-camera ) Can we send it downtown?
RONSON: What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it. The mattress. The mattress. JULIA.
OFFICER: The label is adhesive-backed. CORTEZ licks it and presses it on the mattress. He writes on it - 55L/E1. As he stands up from doing this, a single drop of blood from his thumb lands on the mattress. ( It is important that we see it is only a single drop - and nothing like the amount LARRY spilled on the floorboards. ) CORTEZ leaves the room to fetch a colleague to help him move the mattress. We move in to see the drop of blood disappear very quickly into the mattress, as if it is being sucked in. As this happens, we hear on the soundtrack the faintest RUMBLE.
MALAHIDE: We can bring them back properly more often than scientific orthodoxy dictates, ladies and gentlemen. And the knife, far from the enemy of of analysis, is often its greatest ally in solving the puzzles of psychosis. Analysis isolates and massages. Surgery pinpoints and corrects. . though you've got to know what you're doing, of course.
MALAHIDE: Some things are obvious. Here, for example, .
MALAHIDE: .are the optical motor nerve control centers.
MALAHIDE: Now. This case. A deeply-buried psychosis severe enough to produce frighteningly frequent hysteria and aggression. Incurable. Say others. Not so. Analysis isolates. The knife exposes. Medication controls.
MALAHIDE: And then, ladies and gentlemen, we REBUILD. With all the care and knowledge that our years of training have given us .
MALAHIDE: . WE BRING THEM BACK.
INTERCOM: Dr. Malahide, the new arrival is awake, and appears very distressed.
MALAHIDE: My part in this is over. You may tidy up for me. Kyle, you come with me.
RONSON: Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here I saw it.him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
KIRSTY: I saw it.him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
RONSON: The Cenobites.
KIRSTY: The Cenobites.
KIRSTY: The Demons.
MALAHIDE: Sorry. Must get that door fixed. Detective Ronson?
MALAHIDE: I am Doctor Malahide.
MALAHIDE: My assistant, Kyle Macrae. And this must be Kirsty?
MALAHIDE: I've read the boy's statement. Quite the adventure they believe they had. I'd like to talk to her alone. Do you think . ?
RONSON: Mmmm. O.K. Frankly, I think she's more your territory than mine. Shame.
RONSON: Kirsty. Doctor Malahide's going to look after you now. Maybe we could talk some more tomorrow.
KIRSTY: Wait! The mattress. You've got to destroy it. She DIED on it, you see. The mattress. It's haunted now. She can come back. like Frank. SHE CAN COME BACK. The mattress .
KYLE: Uh.excuse me a moment.
MALAHIDE: Detective. I'll be able to help this girl. But I need your assistance .
KYLE: So.You're Kirsty, huh?
KIRSTY: You a doctor, too?
KYLE: Nearly a doctor. I'm Kyle Macrae. Call me Kyle.
KIRSTY: Hi, Kyle.
MALAHIDE: Now, Kirsty.
KIRSTY: The cop. He didn't believe me.
MALAHIDE: I suspect not. But that doesn't necessarily mean you're wrong, does it?
KIRSTY: Do you believe me?
MALAHIDE: Well, I don't know yet. However, you're not lying. YOU believe this is the truth.
KIRSTY: It IS the truth.
MALAHIDE: Sorry, Dr. Malahide. But it's Tiffany. She's escaped . again.
INTERN: Sorry, Dr. Malahide. But it's Tiffany. She's escaped . again.
MALAHIDE: Very Well.
KIRSTY: I'm sorry, Kirsty. Kyle will come back with something to help you sleep. We shall speak
MALAHIDE: Tiffany. Come.
KYLE: Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. God, if anyone should know not to do that, it's me. I'm sorry. O.K.?
KYLE: Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
KIRSTY: What's the matter with her?
KYLE: Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
KIRSTY: God, that's terrible.
KYLE: Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
KYLE: Anyway, let's concentrate on you for a moment. Wanna suck on this for me?
KIRSTY: Hey, good joke, Kyle. Do you always come on to the mentally
KYLE: Shit. Sorry. Here's the pills. Red face. Door. Bye.
KIRSTY: Jesus, I'm glad I'm not paying for this place.
KIRSTY: ( under her breath )
MALAHIDE: ( off-camera ) And how are we feeling today.?
MALAHIDE: Better? Good.
BROWNING: ( muttering ) Get them off me. Get them off me.
KIRSTY: I.I had a visitor.
KYLE: Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's .it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
KIRSTY: Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's .it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
KYLE: ( Carefully ) Kirsty, I'm sorry. don't understand. I.
KIRSTY: I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
KYLE: Dr. Malahide. Yes. Look, I'll fetch him. You take it easy. I'm sure he can help.
KIRSTY: Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
KYLE: If anyone can help, HE can.
KIRSTY: Yeah? He got a ticket to Hell?
MALAHIDE: ( off-camera Officer Kucich? Yes, Doctor Malahide. You've spoken to Ronson? Yes . That's right. The mattress . No, I'll meet you by the side entrance. No, no, my HOUSE. Yes, let me make that clear. The house, NOT the hospital. . Yes . Fine, and thank you.
KYLE: Doctor Malahide . ?
KIRSTY: It must have been going on
MALAHIDE: KIRSTY snaps back and continues to speak in a more normal voice.
KIRSTY: But the part I know about, That must have started with my Uncle Frank.
MALAHIDE: Then let us speak of it .
DISSOLVE TO: 36 EXT. MALAHIDE's HOUSE TWILIGHT We TRACK in slowly towards a modern house that we will learn is MALAHIDE'S, up the drive, towards the front door.
DISSOLVE TO: 37 INT. MALAHIDE'S HALLWAY TWILIGHT The TRACK continues along the hallway and into the OBSESSION
KYLE: Jesus Christ. Jee-sus-kerr-ist!
KYLE: Oh, shit.
BROWNING: Get them off me. Get. Them. Off. Me.
MALAHIDE: Mr. Browning. Please, lie down.
BROWNING: Here. This will help.
MALAHIDE: Here. This will help.
KYLE: ( mimed ) Jesus Christ!
JULIA: Help me.
JULIA: Help Me.
JULIA: Don't be embarrassed. You're my friend.
JULIA: MALAHIDE says nothing. Perhaps he swallows nervously. The camera continues its circling movements. The scene FADES TO BLACK and JULIA begins to laugh, small, sensual giggles at first building finally as the blackness comes into an almost hysterical crescendo of raucous joy.
KIRSTY: Shit, Kyle. This is getting to be a habit. What is it, some kind of shock-therapy?
KIRSTY: Oh, Jesus. What is it?
KYLE: It's all true.
FADE OUT: FADE IN 54 EXT. MALAHIDE'S HOUSE DAY A simple shot tells us it is the next morning.
FADE IN: 54 EXT. MALAHIDE'S HOUSE DAY A simple shot tells us it is the next morning.
JULIA: I'm cold.
TIME CUT: 57 INT. LIVING ROOM MALAHIDE'S HOUSE DAY CLOSE UP on a strangely Art Deco electric fan heater, with bright red coils emitting waves of heat. We pull out to see MALAHIDE standing by the table with the flowers. There is now a half-full glass of wine on the table, along with an ashtray where a cigarette burns away ignored. A pack of cigarettes is now visible in the breast pocket of MALAHIDE's jacket. JULIA enters the room and closes the door behind her. She is dressed in one of MALAHIDE'S suits. It is a light weight suit of white linen, a suit for expensive holidays in hot countries. She crosses the room to the table; pausing slightly in the centre of the room, to allow MALAHIDE to look at her.
JULIA: MALAHIDE'S nervousness has retreated a little, he manages to smile. He nods his head slowly a few times.
MALAHIDE: Yes. Yes. You look.
JULIA: Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
MALAHIDE: No. You look.
JULIA: Yes, I still like WINE .
JULIA: . and more.
JULIA: Close it.
MALAHIDE: It's a beautiful dress.
JULIA: I know.
TIME CUT: 59 INT. LIVING ROOM MALAHIDE'S HOUSE DAY CLOSE UP MALAHIDE'S hands applying wide, white, surgical bandages to JULIA. We pull out as MALAHIDE steps away from JULIA. They are both standing in the middle of the living room floor. JULIA'S arms, torso, and head are now completely enclosed in neatly and professionally applied bandages. There are three slits for her eyes and mouth but apart from these she is completely covered. Over these she is still wearing the white dress.
MALAHIDE: JULIA lifts her arms slightly to look at them and then touches her bandaged face. She turns towards MALAHIDE. The camera begins the same circling movement it made around them the previous night. MALAHIDE'S nervousness has practically disappeared. He has helped this woman. He has bandaged her and dressed her. He is slightly in awe of her, but it is now tinged with excitement, not fear. The camera's circling grows faster.
MALAHIDE: JULIA walks towards him, slowly raising her hands. When she is close enough her hands cup his cheeks. She pulls him towards her, and, tipping her head to one side, kisses him. Her body moulds itself to his. She leans her head back. Were they have kissed blood has pressed up onto the bandage from her skinned flesh. It looks like smeared MALAHIDE puts his arms around her waist. They kiss tenderly. Slowly, almost nervously, he lowers his hands until they rest on her buttocks and presses her in towards him. They begin to spin themselves now, echoing the camera movements. They cross the room, kissing blindly, until they come to rest against the wall that bears JULIA's bloody palm print. JULIA twists their bodies so that MALAHIDE is pressed against the wall, and begins to move her hips forcefully and sensually against

JULIA: ( almost coyly ) Now all we need is a skin.
KIRSTY: 61 INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT DAY It is basically a studio apartment - everything except the bathroom facilities is in the one room. There is a sofa - with sheets and blankets on it - a bed, a dining/all-purpose table with two chairs, shelves full of records and books, and a small working desk against one of the walls. The desk is weighed down by text books and notes and, tacked to the wall above it, are medical prints, some of the brain and central nervous system, but also two fullcoloured anatomical prints - one of a man and one of a woman. They could almost be portraits of JULIA and FRANK. KYLE, fully dressed, is standing by the bathroom door, his hand still in a knocking position.
KYLE: You O.K.? Kirsty? You 0. K.? No bad dreams.
KYLE: Kirsty? You 0. K.? No bad dreams.
KIRSTY: No bad dreams.
KYLE: So you slept O.K.?
KIRSTY: As much as that bed of nails allowed.
KYLE: Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on.
KIRSTY: Oh yeah? On your own a lot,
KYLE: Like the robe?
KYLE: I think I need to talk. About what I saw.
KIRSTY: You thought I was crazy, didn't
KYLE: Jesus, yes! What do you expect. I mean, God, I still do! It's just that now I'm crazy too.
KIRSTY: And you're sure it was a woman?
KYLE: God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
KIRSTY: Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
KYLE: Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
KIRSTY: What can I do? How can I save him? The box. I need the box.
KIRSTY: The box. I need the box.
KYLE: The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
KIRSTY: ( sharply ) The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
KYLE: The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
KIRSTY: What do you mean?
KYLE: The boxes! I TOLD you.
KIRSTY: You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got.
KYLE: Yeah. The things you were talking about.
KIRSTY: I'm going. Wait a minute. What do you mean, 'I'm going?' TO the HOUSE?
KYLE: Wait a minute. What do you mean, 'I'm going?' TO the HOUSE?
KIRSTY: Get out of the way.
KYLE: Are you crazy?
KIRSTY: I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
KYLE: ( shouting ) Because I'm going to get my father!
WHY?: ( shouting ) Because I'm going to get my father!
KIRSTY: ( shouting ) Because I'm going to get my father!
KIRSTY: I'm going to get my father.
KYLE: Two seconds. Just two seconds. Don't move. O.K. Let's go.
KYLE: O.K. Let's go.
KIRSTY: Kyle, you don't have.
KYLE: I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
KYLE: Wait! The .. thing . I want to be sure it's not here.
JULIA: Sssh. I think it's still here.
KYLE: What? The.The thing?
JULIA: Yes. I had to stop you going in there because I knew you'd cry out. Any normal person would. It .It's just TERRIBLE.
KYLE: Is it in there?
JULIA: No. Not now.
JULIA: Was I right? Is it terrible?
KYLE: Yes. Yes, it's terrible.
JULIA: Oh. You look awful. You poor boy. Come here. .Come to Mother .
JULIA: .Come to Mother .
JULIA: What's your name?
KYLE: I'm JULIA.
JULIA: I'm JULIA.
JULIA: Thank you, Kyle.
KIRSTY: ( to herself )
KIRSTY: ( slightly louder )
JULIA: Kirsty! How nice of you to drop in.
JULIA: You have surprisingly good taste in men.
KIRSTY: Kyle! No! I'll kill you,
JULIA: Oh, you can try it, you little bitch. I'd love you to try it. But I'm not just the woman I was.
KIRSTY: What, you mean you're something more than a whore with a vicious I mean I'm something more than human, you little shit!
JULIA: I mean I'm something more than human, you little shit!
JULIA: Oh, Kirsty. They didn't tell you, did they? I'm afraid they've changed the rules of the fairy tale; I'm no longer just the wicked step-mother.
JULIA: Now I'm the Evil Queen.
JULIA: So come on; Take your best shot, Snow White.
MALAHIDE: ( off-camera )
TIME CUT: 70 INT. OBSESSION ROOM DAY TIFFANY sits cross-legged in the middle of the floor. She appears to be alone in the room. Cradled in her lap is a Lament Configuration, taken from one of the glass cases on the low On a wall behind TIFFANY, one of the large prints that previously hung there has been taken down. Revealed in the space behind it is a large mirror. The camera moves in towards this mirror.
JULIA: You're sure this is what you
MALAHIDE: It's what I've ALWAYS wanted. A view of .
MALAHIDE: You were almost enough, Julia but.I have to see. I have to
JULIA: Oh, I quite understand.
MALAHIDE: She's done it.
JULIA: She certainly has.
MALAHIDE: It's coming.
JULIA: It certainly is.
PINHEAD: The FEMALE stops and looks questioningly at PINHEAD. PINHEAD, at a more leisurely pace, crosses towards TIFFANY and looks down at her. She stares back at him, the remnants of her insanity a temporary defense against fear, her face registering PINHEAD looks up.
PINHEAD: The FEMALE looks across at him.
CENOBITE: PINHEAD shakes his head.
PINHEAD: He glances down at TIFFANY again.
PINHEAD: It is not HANDS that call us.
PINHEAD: . It is DESIRE.
KIRSTY: Oh, shit.
KIRSTY: TIFFANY stops, startled, and looks at the doorway and KIRSTY. KIRSTY raises her hands in a placatory gesture and speaks more KIRSTY begins to move into the room slowly and shakes her head KIRSTY is rewarded with a small recognizing smile from TIFFANY, KIRSTY returns the smile.
NO!: TIFFANY stops, startled, and looks at the doorway and KIRSTY. KIRSTY raises her hands in a placatory gesture and speaks more KIRSTY begins to move into the room slowly and shakes her head KIRSTY is rewarded with a small recognizing smile from TIFFANY, KIRSTY returns the smile.
KIRSTY: Wait. Wait. Hey, remember me? From the hospital? I was in the next room?
KIRSTY: Hey, remember me? From the hospital? I was in the next room?
KIRSTY: You don't want to go down there. You REALLY don't want to go down there.
KIRSTY: Jesus Christ.
KIRSTY: Tiffany. Wait!
KIRSTY: Tiffany! Don't trust it! Don't Trust it!
JULIA: Do be careful.
KIRSTY: KIRSTY puts down the photograph of her family and looks around the room again. A troubled look crosses her face. Despite the aparent Summer light in the room, KIRSTY suddenly realises what it is that is odd. She looks from wall to wall with mounting distress on her face. There are no windows in the room. And no door. At this point, the odd discordant note in the birdsong becomes apparent. It is nothing too obvious at the moment - the total effect is simply less sweet than it was. KIRSTY looks back at the photograph and snatches it up, with a look of concern. The photograph has changed. It is now a wedding photo. The wedding of LARRY and JULIA. Suddenly the photograph begins to bleed. Blood pours from the paper itself, pressing up and smearing against the glass-so that it is momentarily framed blood, without a single trace of the picture showing. The blood begins to escape out of the frame, trickling over the lip that holds the glass in place and dripping onto KIRSTY's fingers. With a cry of horror, KIRSTY drops the frame. It lands on the floor and the glass shatters. The blood continues to flow. In fact, now that the glass does not restrain it, it fairly fountains out, spreading across the floor. KIRSTY steps back and glances at the dresser. Blood is flowing from every frame, pooling on the dresser and overflowing onto the By now, the discordant elements in the birdsong are very much predominant and, as KIRSTY sweeps all the frames off the dresser and onto the floor with a scream of anguish, the birdsong gives way completely to a hideous, dissonant shrieking. KIRSTY throws her hands to her ears.
KIRSTY: She rushes at one of the walls and begins beating it with her The walls are soft and pulpy and give slightly as her fists strike, like flabby flesh. KIRSTY stands back in disgust. The wall visibly bruises before her eyes, swelling and purpling. The light in the room, like the birdsong, has changed utterly. It is not dark, but simply dull, featureless, and depressing. KIRSTY turns away in disgust and finds that the whole room has given in to decay. The sofas and chairs are mildewed and rotten, the wooden furniture is ridden with woodworm and rot. A skinned rat runs across the room beside the buckled and chipped skirting board. A rotten leg gives way under a small chest and the bottom drawer spills out, freeing a whole family of quite large spiders which run wildly across the floor. Suddenly the room begins to fill with smoke, churned up by an ever-increasing intensity of wind. The smoke obscures the screen.
PINHEAD: Ah, Kirsty. And we thought we'd lost you.
FEMALE CENOBITE: So sweet of you to come back. How can it send us back, child? We're already here. And so are you.
PINHEAD: How can it send us back, child? We're already here. And so are you.
KIRSTY: No! You. You can't! It wasn't me.I didn't do it! I didn't open the box!
FEMALE CENOBITE: Didn't open the box. And what was it last time? Didn't know what the box was. And yet we DO keep finding each other, don't we?
PINHEAD: Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
FEMALE CENOBITE: Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us? But I didn't open it! I didn't!
KIRSTY: But I didn't open it! I didn't!
PINHEAD: Then why are you here?
KIRSTY: I've come for my father!
PINHEAD: But he's in his own Hell, child And quite unreachable.
KIRSTY: I don't believe you!
PINHEAD: But it's true, He is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
KIRSTY: And what about you?
PINHEAD: It's different for us.
FEMALE CENOBITE: We've always been here.
PINHEAD: We have no more surprises.
PINHEAD: But, please; feel free. Explore. We'll always be here.
PINHEAD: . we have Eternity to know your flesh!
JULIA: Come. I have such sights to show you.
KIRSTY: Do you see? You were RIGHT. This IS a puzzle, too. But WE'RE CAUGHT in the puzzle.
KIRSTY: TIFFANY smiles directly at KIRSTY and then returns her nod.
KIRSTY: TIFFANY nods again, more emphatically.
KIRSTY: KIRSTY throws her arms around TIFFANY and hugs her.
MALAHIDE: Enough. God, that's enough. We HAVE to go back.
JULIA: Go back? What an earth makes you think we can go back?
MALAHIDE: I want to go back!
JULIA: Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
VOICE: KIRSTY stops dead in her tracks. She looks at the door and moves toward it, walking slowly down the corridor. TIFFANY
KIRSTY: ( Very Tentatively )
KIRSTY: Tiffany. Wait here. If I'm not back real soon - get out. Get home.
KIRSTY: A low moan comes from the far end of the room. KIRSTY assumes it issues from the figure hidden beneath the blanket and walks nearer, lifting her arm in readiness to remove the blanket.
KIRSTY: Daddy. It's Kirsty.
KIRSTY: Oh God.
VOICE: No. Over here. Behind the
KIRSTY: Daddy. ? That's it, baby. Come to
FRANK: That's it, baby. Come to
KIRSTY: it is her UNCLE FRANK, back in his skin and dressed in white shirt and jeans. FRANK chuckles. KIRSTY backs away from him into the room. FRANK puts out his right hand in a placatory gesture. KIRSTY realises he is not moving after her. She also sees that his body is curiously angled, the left side still in the deep shadow cast by the screen. Is there something else there? Something she can't quite see? FRANK's voice stops her wondering.
NO!: it is her UNCLE FRANK, back in his skin and dressed in white shirt and jeans. FRANK chuckles. KIRSTY backs away from him into the room. FRANK puts out his right hand in a placatory gesture. KIRSTY realises he is not moving after her. She also sees that his body is curiously angled, the left side still in the deep shadow cast by the screen. Is there something else there? Something she can't quite see? FRANK's voice stops her wondering.
FRANK: What's the matter, Kirsty? It's only Frank. It's only Uncle Frank.
KIRSTY: I should have known! I should've known he wouldn't be here! This place is only for filth like you!
FRANK: Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
KIRSTY: Shit. Bull. Shit
FRANK: Shit. Bull. Shit
FRANK: See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
KIRSTY: No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
FRANK: 'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all. You're full of shit, Frank Cotton. My Dad wasn't like that at all. He could feel. He could love. He loved ME.
KIRSTY: You're full of shit, Frank Cotton. My Dad wasn't like that at all. He could feel. He could love. He loved ME.
KIRSTY: He.he loved me.
FRANK: Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
KIRSTY: He loved me, you bastard! He Loved me, he loved my mother. He even loved that bitch you betrayed him with! Ah, Julia. She hasn't been to see me recently. That's why it's so nice to have you here, baby. Daddy's little girl. So pretty when she's upset. Come to Daddy,
FRANK: Ah, Julia. She hasn't been to see me recently. That's why it's so nice to have you here, baby. Daddy's little girl. So pretty when she's upset. Come to Daddy,
FRANK: Now don't be naughty, Kirsty. Or I'll have to punish you first. Perhaps you'd like that. Would you like that?
KIRSTY: Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
FRANK: I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
LARRY: Get your fucking hands off my daughter, you bastard!
MALAHIDE: No! No! Julia! Help me!
JULIA: But you WANTED this. You wanted to SEE. You wanted to KNOW. And here it is. The heart of Hell.
JULIA: Why do you think I was allowed to go back? For YOU? No, it wanted souls. And I brought you. And you wanted to KNOW. Now you're both happy.
JULIA: Goodbye, Doctor. It's been real.
FRANK: How convenient.
LARRY: Stay there, baby. Don't come in.
FRANK: Yes. Stay there. I'll be with you in a minute.
JULIA: She turns away without a backward glance and moves back into the 95 INT. THE KNIFE ROOM FRANK is still impaled on the knives, but his anguished howl has Become small whimpers of complaint ( with, given his history with the CENOBITES, perhaps the tiniest note of pleasure in there, too ) KIRSTY, LARRY and TIFFANY are now gathered together to one side of the room near the door that leads to the corridor. They should leave, but a kind of sick fascination keeps them watching FRANK. FRANK realises only leverage will pull him free of the knives and lifts his forearms up as much as they are free to. He turns his palms to face the knives and, with a growl of self- encouragement, drives them deeply onto the knives so that he can begin to push the rest of his impaled body backwards. It takes several seconds and much pain for him to succeed, but succeed he does. He flops backwards into the room. Several of the knives have stayed in him, rather than the wall - his chest is decorated, or armed, with many blades. Just as FRANK begins to stand, and just as LARRY and the girls snap out of it and are about to leave, the door from the CONVEYOR BELT ROOM opens and JULIA walks into the room. KIRSTY and LARRY gasp. FRANK gives a slow smile.
JULIA: Well, well. All my family together again. How very I knew you'd come.
FRANK: ( delighted/flattered ) I knew you'd come.
JULIA: ( Flatly ) I knew you'd come.
FRANK: I knew you'd come.
JULIA: You knew?
FRANK: Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
JULIA: Oh, I do. I do.
FRANK: And I know how much I mean to you. Come here.
FRANK: Come here. Kiss me. And
FRANK: . we'll have a real family
LARRY: Jesus Christ, FRANK. I don't believe you. You don't know her at all do you? You still think you're in charge.
FRANK: Of course I am. She BELONGS to me.
KIRSTY: For God's sake! He KILLED you!
FRANK: She's forgiven me that. Haven't
JULIA: Do you really need to ask?
FRANK: Show them.
FRANK: Just a small inconvenience, babe.
LARRY: Jesus! Out. Out!
LARRY: Wait a minute. Why are we following her? Who is this?
KIRSTY: This is Tiffany
KIRSTY: . She's good at puzzles.
LARRY: They take the turn TIFFANY has indicated.
JULIA: Nothing personal, babe.
KIRSTY: Oh. My. God.
KIRSTY: Tiffany, listen. You've solved it. But we've got to solve it the OTHER way. See? See? We've got to get out.
LARRY: Come on!
KIRSTY: Please! Tiffany, Please! Get us out! Take us home,
KIRSTY: Malahide .
KIRSTY: Jesus Christ! Of course .
MALAHIDE: And to think I hesitated .
MALAHIDE: Tiffany. Come. I have a whole new world of puzzles for you to enjoy .
MALAHIDE: A whole new world of pleasures for you to endure.
LARRY: No. I've had enough of this shit. Who the hell are you?
KIRSTY: It's .
LARRY: Never mind. Never mind.
LARRY: Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.
LARRY: O.K. You've done it before. You can do it again. GET US OUT OF
HERE!: The three of them run back up the catwalk. LEVIATHAN spins wildly and a myriad of black beams flow from it. As they shine into the catwalk they become limbs like those that captured MALAHIDE, but all with different tips; some are organic, vicious mouths, some are hooks or blades, some are faces, some are ( as if LEVIATHAN Is too angry to be thinking straight ) beautiful flowers. The limbs fly up the catwalk, but the HUMANS have gained too great a start. The limbs retract rapidly into the black lights. MALAHIDE staggers to his feet, just as LEVIATHAN re-directs its energy into forming and projecting one much fatter limb. It is dirty pink and segmented, like a vast earthworm. The end peels back as it flies toward MALAHIDE, revealing a cruel, metallic, and rapidly-spinning surgical saw. Just as MALAHIDE stands up straight, the limb smashes into the back of his skull. There is a distressing WHIRRING noise as the limb seals itself fleshily to MALAHIDE's skull and the former surgeon twitches and dances in horrible involuntary movements as LEVIATHAN takes over what little mind remains.
KIRSTY: No. Come on. We have to get out of here.
JULIA: Oh, poor Larry. You never could hold on to anything for very long, could you?
JULIA: With a final, slurping sound, the skinned woman slips from the skin and disappears down the new corridor. The momentary break in tension allows LARRY to make one last effort. He rounds the corner and pulls the girls after him. TIFFANY, finally, realising what has happened, screams in terror and disgust, especially when she looks at what she has brought round the corner in her hand. She drops JULIA's skin to the floor as the three of them scramble to their feet and begin to run again. Still clutched in the skin's hollow fingers is the white diamond BOX. As they turn another corner, they see, very far in the distance, a glimmer of light. TIFFANY points excitedly.

KIRSTY: My God, it's her room!
LARRY: Let's go!
KIRSTY: No. No, there's something
LARRY: Jesus. O.K. No more arguments. Just RUN!
LARRY: Go. Go. Go. Go. Go!!
KIRSTY: Tiffany . ?
KIRSTY: But these were . Daddy?
KIRSTY: These flowers. I saw them just.
KIRSTY: .the day .before. yesterday Daddy? Daddy!
KIRSTY: LARRY is unconscious. TIFFANY gasps. KIRSTY looks up at her.
KIRSTY: Get help.
KIRSTY: Pass me a pillow.
KIRSTY: What do you do? I just don't know what to do. Coronary arrest. Let's be quick.
INTERN: Coronary arrest. Let's be quick.
KIRSTY: Is he going to be 0.K.?
INTERN: We just can't say. O.R.'s on standby. They'll do what they can.
KIRSTY: But it's bad?
INTERN: ( gently but flatly ) Yeah. It's bad.
INTERN: Wait out here. A doctor will talk to you when we know more.
KIRSTY: Is he going to be all right? No. He's not going to be all right.
KIRSTY: 1st GOWNED FIGURE
KIRSTY: Oh, Fuck.
KIRSTY: C'mon. C'MON!
KIRSTY: COME ON!!
COME ON!!: Suddenly, the doors fly open. KIRSTY and TIFFANY tumble into the 109 INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR DAY ( GIRLS' P.O.V. ) We see the door-frame of the elevator and the floor buttons beside it and, looking down the corridor through the open elevator doors, PINHEAD and the FEMALE CENOBITE marching towards We also see KIRSTY'S finger jabbing frantically at the floor buttons. The doors are not closing. The CENOBITES are getting very close. Finally, just as PINHEAD breaks from his determined but medium- paced stride and speeds up eagerly for the last two or three yards, extending his arm as he does so, the door slams shut across our vision and we hear the elevator machinery start up.
KIRSTY: Faster, you bastard, faster!
KIRSTY: Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
KIRSTY: It's 0.K. They can't beat an elevator. Not upstairs. It'll be O.K.
KIRSTY: It'll be O.K.
KIRSTY: This way. Short cut.
KIRSTY: Oh, Christ. This isn't just personal anymore.
MALAHIDE: The Doctor is in!
TIFFANY: Oh, shit.
MALAHIDE: I recommend amputation.
PINHEAD: Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
FEMALE CENOBITE: No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
PINHEAD: Time to play.
KIRSTY: No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
PINHEAD: No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
KIRSTY: No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
PINHEAD: Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
PINHEAD: What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
KIRSTY: No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
PINHEAD: Nonsense, I.
KIRSTY: It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
FEMALE CENOBITE: She raises her hand towards KIRSTY. PINHEAD's arm flies out and stops her.
PINHEAD: He is staring at the photograph, that great immobile brow finally puckering, as if something is stirring.
PINHEAD: You were ALL human!
KIRSTY: You were ALL human!
MALAHIDE: Tiffany. Come.
MALAHIDE: Tiffany. Come.
KIRSTY: Leave her alone, you asshole!
MALAHIDE: Oh,good. A fight.
PATIENT: So what, girls? It's O.K. for an ego-trip but it doesn't got the job done.
TIFFANY: I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
KIRSTY: ( Confused ) What are you talking.
TIFFANY: ( to herself ) I've got to finish it.
KIRSTY: Finish what?
KIRSTY: Tiffany! Wait!
KIRSTY: Oh, gross.
KIRSTY: What are you doing? What are WE doing?
TIFFANY: I can't do it here. I have to go to it.
TIFFANY: I'm scared.
KIRSTY: No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
MALAHIDE: Ah, girls. And how are we feeling today?
MALAHIDE: You have your whole lives behind you now.
KIRSTY: Tiffany! No! Surgery is open, Tiffany. What was today's agenda?
MALAHIDE: Surgery is open, Tiffany. What was today's agenda?
MALAHIDE: Ah, yes. Evisceration.
JULIA: Doctor. I've missed you.
MALAHIDE: I knew you'd come back.
JULIA: I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
JULIA: Do it, Tiffany! Do it!
JULIA: Trust me.
FADE OUT: FADE IN 120 INT. RECOVERY ROOM DAY CLOSE UP on a bowl of beautiful flowers, sitting on a shelf in the recovery room. The camera TRACKS out to let us see LARRY, pale, drawn, but basically okay, in the room's single bad. He is wired up to various drips and monitors. Sunlight is flooding into the room from a window and the camera continues its TRACK up to and through this window to;
