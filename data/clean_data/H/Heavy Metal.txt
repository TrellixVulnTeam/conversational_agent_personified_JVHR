AUSTIN: (looking at the holograph) Hmmmm ....
AUSTIN: (seeing sparks) Uh - oh ....
COUNCILMAN #3: They're killing everyone.  We must escape!
COUNCILMAN #2: The city is burning!
COUNCILMAN #4: (throwing a parchment before the Elder) Even the mountains glow green and an evil slime oozes down!
COUNCILMAN #1: Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We must fight!
ELDER: Silence!
ELDER: We are not a race of warriors. We are statesmen, and scientists. From our very beginning it was ordained that the warrior-race of Taarak the Defender would aid us in times of need. This was the Pact!
COUNCILMAN #1: Taarak the Defender?  His race is dead!  They cannot defend anyone!
COUNCILMAN #2: Some say that the race is not dead - that one still lives.
COUNCILMAN #1: One?  What good is one?
ELDER: One of Taarak's blood can do much.
BOY: Elder!  They are at the walls!
COUNCILMAN #3: Well who is this last Defender? How can he be summoned?
ELDER: It is Taarna, of the blood of Taarak the Defender - the last of the race.  And must be summoned as my forefathers summoned Taarak himself - from within!
COUNCILMAN #2: But will this Defender answer?
ELDER: A Taarakian has no choice.  They must answer.  It is in their blood.
BOY: They are in the halls!  They are coming!!
ELDER: (calmly to the boy) Bar the door. (to the Councilmen) We will summon the Defender together.
ELDER: (shutting eyes) Taarna ... Taarna ...
HUMANOID: I owe you my life.  Let me repay you ...
AUSTIN: Dammit!
BOMBARDIER: Where the hell are we?
NAVIGATOR: We're there Stepek, right on target ... Rabual dead ahead!
BOMBARDIER: Gee!  Thanks for telling me, Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland.
BOMBARDIER: For Christ sake, hold her steady!
BELLYGUNNER: Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop 'em and let's get outta here!
BOMBARDIER: Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I'm gonna hit something. (he settles over the bomb sight) Left two degrees ... steady ... steady ...
BELLYGUNNER: Hey kid, how ya doing back there?
TAILGUNNER: Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay ... I think.
PILOT: Button it up, we're almost there.
NAVIGATOR: C'mon Stepek, there's the whole island of Rabaul down there, you can't miss!
BOMBARDIER: Screw you ...
PILOT: We took a hit ...
PILOT: Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.
BELLYGUNNER: We took one back here too. C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!
BOMBARDIER: (hand on the release button) Steady ... steady ... bombs away! Let's get the hell outta here!
BOMBARDIER: Yahoo!  Bullseye!
PILOT: (exhilarated) Nice shooting Stepek, how are the rest of you guys?
FLIGHT ENGINEER: Flight Engineer okay.
RADIO OPERATOR: Radio okay.
NAVIGATOR: Navigator check.
BELLYGUNNER: Belly okay.
TAILGUNNER: Ah ... tail okay ...
PILOT: Bellson ... Lewis?
PILOT: Kid, check the waist positions, see if they're okay.
TAILGUNNER: Yeah ... will do, skipper.
PILOT: (wearily) Let's go home.
CREW: Cheers and whoops.
TAILGUNNER: Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both dead.
PILOT: Dammit!
BOMBARDIER: Well kid, now you got a real bombing mission under your belt.
BELLYGUNNER: Sorry about Elkhorn, skip. What happened?
PILOT: I dunno.  The shell exploded and he collapsed.  I think he took it in the head.
BELLYGUNNER: Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?
PILOT: He's dead.
BOMBARDIER: (sings drunkenly) Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's hole and the woodpecker said God bless my soul; take it out, take it out, take it out, remove it ...
TAILGUNNER: (bolder) Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?
BOMBARDIER: Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't like my voice?
NAVIGATOR: Something's wrong!
PILOT: You got a problem, Holden?
BOMBARDIER: Naw, the kid's the one with the problem.  He don't like my voice!
PILOT: Button it up Stepek.  What's the problem, Holden?
NAVIGATOR: I must have a malfunction, my compass says we're heading north!
PILOT: Mine says east.
NAVIGATOR: Hey, can you guys see the rest of the squadron?
BELLYGUNNER: Negative, there's too much cloud.
PILOT: What the hell ...
PILOT: Hey Holden, now my compass has gone crazy.  It's spinning like a son of a bitch!
NAVIGATOR: Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic field or something !!
PILOT: Christ, now they're all doing it!!
BOMBARDIER: You guys quit talking business? I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's ...
PILOT: (irritably) Can it Stepek, we got real problems.
BELLYGUNNER: Jesus!  Look at that!!
PILOT: Look at what ... look at what!!?
BELLYGUNNER: It's out there, just look at it ...
PILOT: For Christ sake, give us a position!
BELLYGUNNER: It's about four o'clock, just below ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!
PILOT: Damn.
PILOT: We lost the goddamned prop ... Did it do any damage?  Kid, check the tail.
PILOT: Come in kid ... kid are you okay?
PILOT: Travis; go check the back.
BELLYGUNNER: Will do, skipper.
PILOT: (to himself) Goddamn it, now what?
PILOT: Gremlins! (rubbing his eyes) Jesus, I must be getting tired.
PILOT: Travis, what's goin' on back there?
PILOT: Holden, how far to base?
NAVIGATOR: Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd, I'd guess about two hundred miles.
PILOT: For Christ's sake, find us a place I can put her down!
NAVIGATOR: It's all ocean down there, skip!
PILOT: Mack, can you get us a radio fix?
RADIO OPERATOR: Negative skip, too much interference.
PILOT: Shit!  I've gotta put her down!
BOMBARDIER: Hey Holden ... ya old stuff shirt ... ya wanna snort?
PILOT: For God sakes Stepek, shut up!
BOMBARDIER: Oh my God, there's ... there's ... ahh ... keep away ... keep away ... (struggles) ... hey no ... hey somebody ... (screams)
NAVIGATOR: Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will you lay off the booze, you've got the D.T.'s ...
PILOT: Holden, for God's sake get up here on the double.
NAVIGATOR: What's the problem, skip?
PILOT: Just get up here!
NAVIGATOR: What is it, skip? (looking out windows)
PILOT: Hold 'em off.  I'm taking her down.
NAVIGATOR: (struggling) Okay you little bastards ... shit ... (screams)
PILOT: (struggling) Jesus H. Christ!
AUSTIN: Got it.
LITTLE GIRL: It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?
AUSTIN: (concentrating) Yes dear.  But Daddy's fixing it.  (hums)
LITTLE GIRL: (watching) How come it's always breaking?
AUSTIN: I don't know, sweetheart.  Mmmmhmm.
LITTLE GIRL: When it's fixed, will you make more funny pictures for me?
AUSTIN: Honey, why don't you go play with your toys and let Daddy finish his work, okay?  Mmmm ...
LITTLE GIRL: Okay.
WITCH: Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec! Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon it with fear.  For in its glow lies the end of heaven - the beginning of hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death in your hands.  For death is upon you.  And as you perish ... so dies your race!
WITCH: (screaming) Take it !!
FEMALE REPORTER: (to driver) Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were sighted in Arizona this morning.  Do you still say this has nothing to do with the green radiation from space.
T.V. NEWSMAN: (walking alongside) Doctor, is it true that the President himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six Project so that you could investigate those mutations? Doctor, answer me that.
FAT POLITICIAN: ... well what I wanna know is, what's the Army doing about this? Hell!  My constiuents are turning green!  They're growing arms on their backs.  There's something or someone up there in space and the voters have a right to know about it!
GENERAL: Senator, we have no proof that these mutations are the result of interference from outer space.  In fact, Doctor Anrak has just come in, so let's hear what he has to say ... Doctor?
DOCTOR: First of all, there is no cause for alarm.  As for the theories of interference by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that we on Earth are the only intelligent, technically advanced civilization present in the universe.
DOCTOR: ... and whatever is causing these mutations is not from outer space. it's more likely just an isolated biological pheno ... pheno ... ph ... ph ... ph ...
DOCTOR: Pretty ... pretty ... p ... p ...
DOCTOR: Aaarrgghh!
SECRETARY: Eeeeeek!
ROBOT: (Mechanical voice) Oh, nice job.  How am I supposed to fix this guy?  He's fucked.
ZEKE: (to Edsel) I guess we turned it up a little too high.
EDSEL: (to Robot) Sorry, man.
ROBOT: You're sorry?  What about me? I've gotta put this asshole back together.
GLORIA: (gasp)  Where am I?
ROBOT: (staring) Hey, who's the chick?
GLORIA: Well look at my clothes! Who's gonna pay for the dry cleaning?  And where am I? I demand that you return me to my office immediately.
ROBOT: Too late - molecular instability zone around spacecraft. You cannot leave.
GLORIA: (to Zeke) What?!  Is he kidding?
ZEKE: Uh ...
ZEKE: ... oh yeah.  Instability zone. You're stuck here.
GLORIA: (stunned) But I have to be at my parents for dinner tonight.  And my gynecologist appointment is on Wednesday.
ROBOT: Not anymore.  Would you, ah, like a drink? (leading her away) You'll feel better after a glass of fresh blo-aak.
GLORIA: Do you have any diet soda?
EDSEL: (to Zeke) Ah, typical robot.  The first Earth-chick we see in ten years, and he's gotta make a play for her.
ZEKE: Hey, do we have any of that Plutonian Nyborg left?
EDSEL: Uh, yeah.  Just one bag.  Uh, it's in the transmitter compartment.
ZEKE: Uh, thanks man.
ZEKE: (surveying the lines) Oh great.  Think this is enough?
EDSEL: (thinking) Uhh ... nah.  Go for broke.
ZEKE: Good thinking, man.
ZEKE & EDSEL: Nose dive!
EDSEL: Oh, wow ... good Nyborg!
GLORIA: (glazed) That was incredible.  I've never felt anything like it.
ROBOT: Oh great.  I have been programmed to be fully proficient in sexual activities. Do you want to go steady?
GLORIA: Gee, I don't know.  I already have a boyfriend.
ROBOT: Ah, what he does not know will not hurt him.
OFFICER ON SCREEN: Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ... Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...
ZEKE: Whaddyawant, man?
OFFICER ON SCREEN: Mothership calling Starcruiser Alpha ...
EDSEL: (to Zeke) You gotta use the microphone.
ZEKE: Oh yeah. (shouts into microphone) Whaddyawant man?
OFFICER: Now listen, idiot.  Do I have to tell you eight hundred times?  You don't call me "man"!  You call me "Com-Op Officer Blix". Now is that perfectly clear?
ZEKE: (into mike) Yeah, sure.  Whaddyawant, man?
OFFICER: (disgruntled) You are to return immediately to the Mother Ship and pick up a humanoid civilian.  Your orders are to escort him to the Interplanetary Tribunal Courtroom so that he can testify at the trial of Lincoln Sternn.  And make it snappy!
EDSEL: Wow!  They finally got Sternn.
ZEKE: It's about time.  Hang on, man. Here we go.
EDSEL: (to Zeke) You okay to land this thing?
ZEKE: No problem, man.
EDSEL: I think you're goin' a little high, man.
ZEKE: It's okay, man.  If there's one thing I know, it's how to drive when I'm stoned.  It's like, you know your perspective's fucked, so you just gotta let your hands work the controls as if you're straight.
EDSEL: Oh, wow, good landing, man.
ZEKE: Thanks.
REGOLIAN GUARD: (to Zeke and Edsel) This man is to be delivered to the, clik, Interplanetary Tribunal, Courtroom #3, clik, Galaxy versus Lincoln Sternn. Thenk yew.  Clik.
FISTE: (meekly) Ah, hello.
EDSEL: (to Fiste) Umm, you're gonna testify at Sternn's trial?
ZEKE: They gotta give him at least, like, life.
FISTE: Lincoln Sternn is a kind and honourable man. (camera pulls close to Fiste's face) He will be freed.
EDSEL: Y'know, I wish they'd clean this place up, man.
ZEKE: Yeah.  It's like pig city out here.
EDSEL: Yeah.
ROBOT: ... but I don't understand.  We laugh together.  We care for each other.  We have highly proficient sex.  Why can't we get married?
GLORIA: Look, we're different, okay?  Let's leave it at that.
GLORIA: ... but mixed marriages just don't work.  What if you get tired of me and run off with a vibrator or something?
ZEKE: There it is, man.  I'm gonna hang a louie here.
EDSEL: (to Fiste) Yeah, well it won't be long now.  Are you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn.
GLORIA: ... alright, alright.  I'll marry you - but on one condition ... I want a Jewish wedding.
ROBOT: A Jewish wedding!?!!!  But this is space.  95% of the population are robots.
GLORIA: Well, find me a robot-rabbi!
ROBOT: Okay, okay!
EDSEL: I give them six months, man.
ZEKE: He doesn't even look Jewish!

STERNN: Shut up, Charlie.  I got an angle.
LAWYER: What angle?
STERNN: (pointing to Fiste) Him!
PROSECUTOR: State your name for the record.
FISTE: (fidgeting nervously with the green ball) I am Hanover Fiste.
STERNN: (winking to lawyer) I promised him thirty-five thousand zuleks to testify on my behalf.
PROSECUTOR: You know the defendant, (pointing) Captain Sternn?
FISTE: Yes, I know Captain Sternn.  And never did there live a kinder, more generous man.  He is an overflowing cup, filled with the very cream of human goodness ...
STERNN: (to lawyer) See?
FISTE: ... in all the time I've known him, he's never done anything immoral ... (thinking) unless maybe the Pre-Schooler's Prostitute ring ...
STERNN & LAWYER: Huh?!?
FISTE: (speaking gently) ... and he's ah, never done anything illegal ... (turning sharply) ... unless you count all the times he sold dope disguised as a nun!! (reverting to meekness) He's always been a good, law-abiding citizen ... (shouting at himself) Awww, gimme a break!! (gentle again) ... of the Federation, and, and ... (going schizo) Shut Up!  Shut Up!  Shut Up! (gentle, but starting to sweat) ... a community-concious individual, ah, ah ... (rising in crazed anger)

FISTE: Hangin's too good for him!!
FISTE: Burnin's too good for him!!
STERNN: Hanover ...
FISTE: He should be torn into little bitsy pieces and buried alive!!!
STERNN: Hanover ...
FISTE: I'll kill him!
STERNN: (to Fiste) H-h-hey, Hanover ... n-now take it easy, Hanover, I'm sure we can talk this ov ...
REGOLIAN #1: Halt, clik, in the name of the Federation, clik.  Where is your corridor pass? (to other Regolians) Unco-operative humanoid, clik, blast him.
REGOLIAN #1: You are now in violation of Code 103-N-17, clik, paragraph A-64 ... unauthorized consumption of Federation property.  Please come quietly, clik, ... thenk yew.

STERNN: Okay, Hanover, you've had this coming!
STERNN: Let's see, thirty-three, thirty- four, thirty-five thousand zuleks. Thanks Hanover.
FISTE: (taking money) S'nothin, boss.
STERNN: And Hanover ...
FISTE: Yes?
STERNN: Goodbye.
TAARAK: To defend - this is the Pact. but when life loses its value, and it taken for nought, then the Pact is ... to avenge!!
BARBARIAN #1: Hey, look.  A new one. (to Taarna) Where you from, baby?
BARBARIAN #2: Doesn't talk much, does she ?
BARBARIAN #3: She doesn't have to talk for what I want to do with her.
BARBARIAN #3: (running his hand across her breastplate) C'mon baby, let's see what's under there.
BARBARIAN #1: (starting to undo her breastplate) Yeah, let's have a look.
BARBARIAN #2: Heey, she's tough.
BARBARIAN #3: Maybe she wants to fight?
BARBARIAN #1: ... or maybe she wants to take us all on?
BARTENDER: Beyond the oasis.
AUSTIN: (to himself) Hmmm ... must be jammed.
AUSTIN: Where'd it go?
DAN: It all started when I found the green meteorite.  I read in Farraday's "Life of the Planets" that smaller ones like this are supposed to burn up when they enter the atmosphere, but for some reason this one didn't ...
DAN: ... so I brought it up to my room, stuck it in my rock collection and forgot about it.  I was experimenting with natural electricity ...
DAN: ... and with the storm warnings up, I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the jackpot.  All I needed was a little juice.
DAN: It works!
DAN: (looking at his green arms) Oh Jesus!
DAN: I felt like I was nothing - just atoms floating in the darkness ...
DAN: Then, a body started to re-form around me.  Only it wasn't my body - this one had muscles.
DAN: It was a great body, but I wasn't too crazy about the face.
DEN: (feeling head) Hmmm ... no hair.
PRIESTS: (chanting softly) Uluhtec, Ulutec ...
QUEEN: By the powers of the glowing Loc-Nar placed in your idol's hand, I demand you come forth, Uluhtec!
DEN: Hmmm ... big!
DAN: There was no way I was gonna walk around this place with my dork hangin' out!
DAN: Wow!  This looked like something right out of the Ten Commandments.
QUEEN: Grant me your strength in return for a living mortal sacrifice!  It has been ordained.  Come forth Uluhtec! I demand it!
DAN: What'd they do that for?
DAN: Normally, I'd be dead by now.  I kept thinking I was going to run out of air, but my new body worked great.  I just hoped her body was working as good as mine.
GIRL: Thank you.
DAN: She had the most beautiful eyes. I wanted to make some conversation but I found my new self asking the same old stupid questions.
DEN: Are you from around here?
GIRL: Well, you may not believe this, but I'm from another world - from a place called Earth.
DEN: Earth?  I too am from Earth. How did you get here?
GIRL: My name is Katherine Wells, and I'm from the British colony of Gibraltar.  Time makes no diff- erence here, but there it was the summer of 1892.  It was evening - I'd gone for a walk on the cliffs when suddenly a sphere fell from the sky.  Following its glow, I came to a shining gate made out of light.  Unable to resist, I stepped through it and awoke in this world.  There I was thin and weakly, fit only to stay indoors. (she stands up) But here, somehow I am stronger, more alive, (she stretches seductively) ... more fully a woman.
DAN: You're not kidding.
DEN: (standing) I, too seem better equipped on this world. (he holds out his arm) My arms are more powerful. (strecthes his fingers) Even my fingers seem to hold great strength.
KATHERINE: You saved my life.  I have no reward to give you, but if any part of me pleases your senses - I would give it willingly.
DAN: Wow!  This was great!  There was no way I'd get a chick like this back on Earth.  I mean, look at her!!
DAN: There was only one problem ...
DAN: I don't know who these jerks were, but they sure picked a bad time to show up ...
DAN: They split us up and took me to this weird castle-type place. I wanted to find out where they'd taken Katherine, but none of these guys seemed to speak English.
ARD: They tell me you are Den of Earth, the one who dared to steal the female sacrifice from the Queen.
DAN: This guy was a shrimp so I figured I'd play it tough.
DEN: Where is the girl?
ARD: I am Ard - supreme leader of the revolution and the next ruler of the world.
DEN: (tougher) The girl!!
ARD: Well, aren't we fierce? If you are truly as tough as you seem, then you will serve me well.  But first, a test. Guards!  Castrate him!
DAN: Uh oh.
DAN: Boy!  I was pretty good at this stuff.
ARD: Excellent.  You are worthy to serve me.
DEN: (aiming machine-gun at him) Give me the girl or die.
ARD: (taking it lightly) Well, if I have a choice, I'll take death.
DEN: So be it.
ARD: Ha ha ha!  You'll have to do better than that.
DAN: I could see why they made this guy their leader.
ARD: (standing up) ... but if you're really interested in the girl; I've had her encased in glass.
DEN: She's dead.
ARD: Actually no.  She's sleeping, but only I can awaken her.
DEN: What do you want of me?
ARD: I want you to steal the sacred Loc-Nar.
DEN: What is this Loc-Nar?
ARD: The Queen's glowing sphere, you fool.  The sacrifice to Uluhtec can only be performed by the possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar. (calling out) Norl!
ARD: (to Den) This is Norl, my bravest warrior. You will go with him to the Queen's castle and steal the Loc-Nar.  Then I will give you the girl.
DEN: And if I refuse?
ARD: If you refuse, you die, she dies, everybody dies.
DAN: Sounded reasonable to me.
NORL: (to Den) Ssh.  Guard post ahead.  We must go underground.
DAN: This guy Norl seemed to know what he was doing.  And, for a gorilla, his English wasn't half bad.
NORL: (to Den) We're underneath the castle moat.
DEN: (to Norl) What are they saying?
NORL: They talk of the savage beast who prowls these catacombs with a fierce hunger and sharp teeth ... (gestures) six inches long.
NORL: Sorry ... (indicating) ... sixteen inches long.
NORL: (to Den) Now we separate.  You and Korg take this door into the Queen's quarters.    The rest of us will move through the walls and enter her chamber from the other side. Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will return it to Ard.  Good luck, Den.
KORG: (whispers and points) Loc-Nar.
DAN: Wow!  It was just like the ball I dug up in my back yard.
DAN: As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I had this real funny feeling.  All by themselves, my hands reached forward to touch it.  But the Loc-Nar moved out of the way. Instead, my hands felt something else - warm flesh.  Then the lights came on.
DAN: Talk about embarassing!
QUEEN: (smiling) Kill them.
CAPTAIN: Can I slit his throat, your Majesty?
QUEEN: Yes, slit his throat.
CAPTAIN: Thank you, your Majesty.
QUEEN: (smiling) Stop!  I have, ah, something better in mind.
GUARD #1: Jeez, not again.
GUARD #2: This always happens.
CAPTAIN: Look, she's the Queen.  She can do whatever she wants.
GUARD #2: Yeah, sure.
GUARD #1: Sure.
QUEEN: If you please me, I may let you live.
DAN: Uh oh.
DEN: What must I do?
QUEEN: Satisfy my appetites.
DAN: Wow!  Eighteen years of nuthin' and now, twice in one day.  What a place!
QUEEN: Come with me.
DEN: Mmmm.
QUEEN: (softly) The rising moon climaxes our love, Den.  Is is a sign, a new beginning.
DEN: Yes, a sign.
DAN: I had no idea what she was talking about.
QUEEN: (stroking him) Neverwhere is a troubled land, but together we could calm it. We could rule side by side. Your strength has brought great peace to my restless body.  It could bring great peace to all the troubled people of this land.
DAN: I knew I was good, but I didn't know I was that good.
CAPTAIN: Your Majesty!  The Loc-Nar is missing - stolen!
QUEEN: (screaming) Fiend!  You make love to me while your accomplices steal the magic sphere!  Guards!  Take him!
QUEEN: (to guards) Hold him still!  I will kill him myself!
DAN: Boy, was she pissed off!
QUEEN: Prepare the flying lizards. I want his head!
ARD: By the power of the magic Loc-Nar placed in your idol's hands, I command you - come forth Uluhtec!
DEN: (to himself) Katherine!
SOLDIER: (pointing) There he is, your Majesty!
QUEEN: The Loc-Nar!
QUEEN: (shouting to her men) Faster!  To the pyramid!
ARD: Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec. Now, give me your power! (to monks) Throw her in.
DEN: Katherine!
KATHERINE: Den!
ARD: No!  You'll ruin everything!
ARD: (to his guards) Kill them!  Kill them both!
QUEEN: The Loc-Nar is mine!
ARD: (struggling) Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!
KATHERINE: (to Den) Where did they go?
DEN: They are gone.  That is all that matters.
DAN: They probably went back to Earth. Boy, will Mom be surprised.
KATHERINE: (looking down) The Loc-Nar ... you could have the power of Uluhtec.  You could be ruler over all these people.
DEN: (looking over the throng) Forget it.
KATHERINE: Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar you could have returned to Earth.
DEN: I like it better here.
DAN: On Earth, I'm nobody.  But here, I am DEN.
WORKER: Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!
HARRY: Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre of the world.
HARRY: ... and now they're talking about letting in low-lifes from other planets, too.
YOUNG MAN: (from outside) You free?
HARRY: Yeah.  Get in.
(V.O.): My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive a cab.
HARRY: Where to, pal?
YOUNG MAN: The U.N. Building.
HARRY: The U.N. Building.  What a joke. Used to be a nice place until they turned it into low rent housing. Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live there if you paid me.
YOUNG MAN: Okay sucker, hand over your cash, now!
HARRY: This city is really going to the dogs.
HARRY: Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches me unless I want 'em to.
