YOUNG MAN: Fresh-faced, eager NORVILLE BARNES. He is gazing off at:
REVERSE: On the small crowd gathered to, like Norville, watch the board men in search of jobs, of various classes and vocations, but alike in their intent gaze, their hands dug into their pockets, their hats pushed back on their heads, bobbing occasionally to get a better view of the chattering board. Men occasionally head for the office as they see a prospect they like. Norville stands pat, watching.
HIS POV: An entry flips over to reveal EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT.
NORVILLE: He brightens.
BOARD: We PAN ALONG the executive entry to EXPERIENCE REQUIRED.
NORVILLE: He frowns. Around him, the crowd is thinning out as men trot in to apply for their respective jobs. We see other entries: JUNIOR EXECUTIVE. PAN TO EXPERIENCE
EXECUTIVE: So in the third quarter we saw no signs of weakening. We're up 18 percent over last year's third quarter gross and, needless to say, that's a new record.
TRACKING: DOWN the LENGTH OF the board room table. Executives line either side. We are APPROACHING the man at the far end of the table, to whom the report is being directed. He is late middle-aged, dressed expensively but conservatively, his attention smilingly fixed on the Executive who drones on.
EXECUTIVE: .The competition continues to flag and we continue to take up the slack. Market share in most divisions is increasing and we've opened seven new regional offices.
REPORTING EXECUTIVE: He drones on.
EXECUTIVE: .Our international division has also shown vigorous upward movement in the past six months and we're looking at some exciting things in
WIDER: Norville, sitting at a coffeeshop counter, sets the pencil down. His chin is sunk disconsolately into his palm. His hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head. He idly stirs his coffee with his spoon. He takes one last gulp of the coffee, then sets the cup down on the want ads, stands, and digs into his pocket for change, turning it inside-out.
WARING HUDSUCKER: looks dreamily out the window. His attention returns to the droning Executive and the benignant smile returns to his
EXECUTIVE: .The news in the money market isn't good it's excellent.
NORVILLE'S BACK: He walks dejectedly down the street, hands shoved into his A sheet of newspaper eddies INTO FRAME. The wind tosses it this way and that. Slap! It plasters against another pedestrian, who bats it The newspaper eddies around some more, then plasters against He peels it off and is about to toss it away but stops, noticing something.
NEWSPAPER SCRAP: It is a section of the want ads. One entry is perfectly circled by a coffee stain.
EXECUTIVE: .we're loaded.
HUDSUCKER: The board turns expectantly to Hudsucker, who sits in the f.g. Beyond him is the length of the board table and the large picture window. He rises to his feet, slowly and deliberately, and rubs his palms together. He swings his chair out. He steps up onto the chair. The board stares. He steps up from the chair onto the board table. The heads of the board members swing up in unison. Hudsucker is FRAMED FROM MID-TORSO DOWN. He shakes the tension loose from each leg, then waggles both arms dangling at his sides, like an athlete preparing for a sprint.
EXECUTIVE: .Mr. Hudsucker?
ANOTHER ANGLE: As the second hand hits the twelve, the CLOCK TOLLS, the board room WINDOW SHATTERS and Waring Hudsucker comes flying SECRETARIAL AREA Somewhere in the Hudsucker Building. A secretary sits typing next to an open window, finished pages sitting stacked beside her. As we hear ANOTHER TOLL of the CLOCK.

HUDSUCKER: As Hudsucker shoots past the window, his draft sends the stack of papers wafting this way and that. As the secretary turns to look out the window, FREEZE FRAME ( wafting papers have their motion arrested ) and SUPER A TITLE.
TRACKING: WITH Hudsucker, the building slipping by behind him. As he yells he calmly runs his palms back over his fringe of hair. The CLOCK TOLLS. FREEZE FRAME and SUPER A TITLE.
DUTCH ANGLE: The Hudsucker Building lists up into the distance. A woman in a fancy fruited hat with a black veil rises INTO FRAME AT an OPPOSING SLANT. Looking down at the sidewalk, she sends two dismayed hands to her cheek and screeeeeeeeeams.
MUSSBURGER: Pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo.
AN EXECUTIVE: He could've opened the window.
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE: Waring Hudsucker never did anything the easy way.
ADDISON: My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
MUSSBURGER: What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
ADDISON: He didn't look unhappy!
EXECUTIVE: Yeah, well, he didn't look rich.
ELDERY EXECUTIVE: Waring Hudsucker was never an easy man to figure out. He built this company with his bare hands. Every step he took was a step up. Except of course this last one.
MUSSBURGER: Sure, sure, he was a swell guy, but when the president, chairman of the board and holder of eighty-seven percent of the company's stock drops forty-four floors
PRECISE EXECUTIVE: ELDERY EXECUTIVE
ELDERY EXECUTIVE: Counting the mezzanine
MUSSBURGER: Then the company has a problem. Stillson, what exactly is the disposition of Waring's stock?
STILLSON: Well, as you know, Hud left no will and had no family. The company bylaws are quite clear in that event. His entire portfolio will be converted to common stock and will be sold over the counter as of the first of the fiscal year following his demise.
MUSSBURGER: Meaning simply that Waring's stock, and control of the company, will be available to the public on January You mean to tell me that any slob in a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy Hudsucker stock?
STILLSON: Meaning simply that Waring's stock, and control of the company, will be available to the public on January You mean to tell me that any slob in a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy Hudsucker stock?
MUSSBURGER: You mean to tell me that any slob in a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy Hudsucker stock?
STILLSON: The company bylaws are quite clear.
ADDISON: My God! You're animals! How can you discuss his stock when the man has just leapt forty-five floors
PRECISE EXECUTIVE: ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE: Not counting the mezzanine.
MUSSBURGER: Quit showboating, Addison, the man is gone. The question now is whether we're going to let John Q. Public waltz in and buy 87 percent of our What're you suggesting, Sidney? Certainly we can't afford to buy a controlling interest.
MUSSBURGER: Not while the stock is this strong. How long before Hud's paper hits the January first.
STILLSON: January first.
AN EXECUTIVE: Thirty days.
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE: Four weeks.
ADDISON: A month at the most.
MUSSBURGER: One month to make the blue-chip investment of the century look like a round-trip ticket on the Titanic.
AN EXECUTIVE: We play up the fact that Hud is dead.
ALL: ( in unison ) Long live the Hud!!
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE: We depress the stock
PRECISE EXECUTIVE: ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE: Not counting the mezzanine.
CAUTIOUS EXECUTIVE: It could work.
OPTIMISTIC EXECUTIVE: It should work.

ENTHUSIASTIC EXECUTIVE: Yeah, a puppet!
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE: A proxy!

HUTCHINSON: .Yeah, you! Barnes!
HUTCHINSON: .You don't look busy! Think you can handle a blue letter? .This letter was sent down this morning by the big guy himself! 'At's right, Waring Hudsucker! It's addressed to Sid Mussburger! Hudsucker's right-hand man! It's a blue letter! That means you put it right in Mussburger's hand. No secretaries! No receptionists! No colleagues! No excuses!
HUTCHINSON: CUT TO:
ELEVATOR DOORS: ROCKETING OPEN. We MOVE IN ON the young elevator operator who leers INTO CAMERA. He wears a brass-buttoned uniform, white gloves and a pillbox hat. The name BUZZ is stitched onto his breast pocket. As Norville enters the elevators:
BUZZ: Hiya, buddy! The name is Buzz, I got the fuzz. .I make the elevator do what she
BUZZ: .I make the elevator do what she
BUZZ: .Hang it up to dry.
BUZZ: .What's your pleasure, buddy?
NORVILLE: ( regaining his balance ) Forty-fourth floor, and it's very
BUZZ: Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?

ELEVATOR DOORS: Sweeping open. Norville staggers out.
BUZZ: ( hissing ) Good luck, buddy!
BUZZ: You'll need it!
NORVILLE: .Mr. Mussburger's office?
OUTER OFFICE: Two secretaries are in Mussburger's outer reception office. The first is a filing secretary who stands frozen in the f.g., her hand poised over an open drawer to deposit a folder, as she stares at Norville with an amused and supercilious sneer which stays pasted on throughout. The second secretary the RECEPTIONIST is seated behind a desk in the b.g. that flanks the door to Mussburger's private office. The Receptionist sits with her hands clasped on the desk, staring at Norville with the hunch-shouldered down-from-under look of a patient vulture.
RECEPTIONIST: Do you have an appointment?
NORVILLE: Uhh, no, I
RECEPTIONIST: Shall we look in the book, hmmmmmmmmm? No, ma'am, ya see, I wouldn't be in We don't seem to be in the boooook.
NORVILLE: No, ma'am, ya see, I wouldn't be in We don't seem to be in the boooook.

RECEPTIONIST: If we had an appointment we'd be in the booook.
NORVILLE: I know but ya see I have this here it is, this letter
CLICK: The blackness and the wailing are both cut short by the sound of a DOOR OPENING. We are:
NORVILLE'S POV: Across miles of carpet is a huge executive desk, behind which is a large executive chair facing the window. From above the back of the chair cigar smoke wreathes up. A telephone cord snakes around to the man sitting in the chair, hidden from us. On the desktop is a perpetual motion machine of large swinging ball bearings. Click-click-click. A TICKERTAPE MACHINE occasionally BURPS information in the far corner of the office. A huge MECHANICAL ARM the sweep second hand of the Hudsucker clock on the facade of the building RUMBLES by immediately outside the window, describing an arc that throws a moving shadow across the office. His BACK TO us, into the phone:
MUSSBURGER: Sure sure, Parkinson's stupid but he's ambitious, too hard to control.
MUSSBURGER: .No! Not McClanahan; sure he bungled the Teleyard merger, but that means he's got something to prove.
MUSSBURGER: .Who let you in?
NORVILLE: Into the phone:
I: Into the phone:
MUSSBURGER: Atwater? Tremendous. Except I fired him last week
MUSSBURGER: Tell him I'll be right there. Well, what is it?
NORVILLE: But Mussburger is listening to the TINNY VOICE issuing from the PHONE.
I: But Mussburger is listening to the TINNY VOICE issuing from the PHONE.
MUSSBURGER: You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No scratch that; I'll fire him. .Make it fast, make it fast.
NORVILLE: The INTERCOM SQUAWKS.
MUSSBURGER: I'll be right there. Give him a .What're you, a mute?
MUSSBURGER: .Yeah, how's the stock doing? .Bad, huh? Well it's not bad enough. .Look, chump, either you find me a grade A ding-dong or you can tender your key to the executive washroom. And that goes double for you. This better be good. I'm in a bad
NORVILLE: Well, sir. I've got something for you from the mailroom, but first if I could just take a minute or so from your very busy time.
NORVILLE: .to show you a, uh.
NORVILLE: .a little something I've been working on for the last two or three .You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby
NORVILLE: .You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby
MUSSBURGER: Wait a minute!
MUSSBURGER: With one hand he thrusts his cigar into Norville's gaping mouth. With his other hand he raises Norville's chin so that his teeth clench it.
MUSSBURGER: He steps back, eyes still on Norville. He jerks his thumb over his shoulder, indicating his chair behind the desk.
MUSSBURGER: Norville, his lips puckered around the unaccustomed ciger, looks bemusedly from the chair to Mussburger.
MUSSBURGER: .Go ahead. Try it on.
MUSSBURGER: .Put your feet up.
MUSSBURGER: .Go ahead.
MUSSBURGER: Hmmmm. Let's get to know one another, shall we?
MUSSBURGER: .Let's chat! .Man to man!
MUSSBURGER: .You weren't blessed with much. .education, were you?
MUSSBURGER: .education, were you?
NORVILLE: Well, I'm a college graduate
MUSSBURGER: All right, but you didn't excel in your studies.?
NORVILLE: Well, I made the dean's list.
MUSSBURGER: ( worried )
NORVILLE: At the Muncie College of Business Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or.
MUSSBURGER: ( relieved ) Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or. ( searches again )
MUSSBURGER: .'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? No, sir.
NORVILLE: No, sir.
MUSSBURGER: Not even behind your back?
NORVILLE: Sir! They voted me most likely to You're fired.
MUSSBURGER: ( curtly ) You're fired.
NORVILLE: But, sir!
MUSSBURGER: Get your feet off that desk.
NORVILLE: Get out of my sight.
MUSSBURGER: Get out of my sight.
MUSSBURGER: My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
NORVILLE: Oh my God, sir!
MUSSBURGER: You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
NORVILLE: Oh my God, sir!
MUSSBURGER: I'll take care of it. Just get out!
MUSSBURGER: Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
NORVILLE: Oh my God, sir!
MUSSBURGER: Now out of here! Out!
MUSSBURGER: Not that way! Through the door!
NORVILLE: But, sir!
MUSSBURGER: Right away, buster! Out of my office!
MUSSBURGER: Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
NORVILLE: Sir, my leg is on fire!
MUSSBURGER: Get out of this office, you dithering
NORVILLE: Oh my God, sir!
MUSSBURGER: My God! The Bumstead contracts!
NORVILLE: Oh my God, sir!
MUSSBURGER: CUT TO:
BUMSTEAD: No magazine. No coffee. Mussburger! I wanna see Mussburger! Or did he jump out a window too?!
NORVILLE: Desperately hanging onto Mussburger by his legs.
NORVILLE: Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger! I gotcha. I gotcha by your pants!
MUSSBURGER: is in a basement tailor shop. LUIGI, an old Italian tailor, is just running his tape up Mussburger's inseam.
LUIGI: Meester Moosaburger, I give-a you pants a nice-a dooble stitch. Make 'em strong, and they look-a real No! Single stitch is fine.
MUSSBURGER: ( barking ) No! Single stitch is fine.
LUIGI: ( begging ) But please-a, Meester Moosaburger, the dooble stitch she last-a forever
MUSSBURGER: Why on earth would I need a double stitch? To pad your bill? Single stitch is fine!
MUSSBURGER: We hear a LOUD TEARING sound O.S. Mussburger drops a few LUIGI AT HIS SEWING MACHINE
LUIGI: ( musing to himself ) What the heck. Meester Moosaburger such a nice-a guy, I give him dooble steech-a anyway. Assa some-a strong- a steech-a, you bet!
MUSSBURGER: sighs with relief. He looks up.
NORVILLE: Norville's arms are wrapped around Mussburger's ankles; the heels of Mussburger's shoes are digging into his face.
MUSSBURGER: Looking. Thinking.
NORVILLE: Struggling to hold on.
MUSSBURGER: Calm. Contemplating.
MUSSBURGER: He absently removes a cigar from his breast pocket and sticks it in his mouth. He holds his lighter under the cigar, not noticing that the flame is pointing the wrong way. He looks at Norville.
NORVILLE: His face drawn with effort, still struggling to hang on. A PULL BACK FROM the EXTREME CLOSE SHOT REVEALS, however, that Norville's arms are now wrapped around emptiness. Mussburger's legs are gone. Norville throws his head back and laughs, it seems, insanely but CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that Norville is merely pantomiming the adventure for the benefit of the board members, including Mussburger. They stand around Mussburger's office, laughing gaily. All safe now, no harm done. This LAUGHING MONTAGE Montage silent but for MUSIC.

The subhead reads: Stockholders Wary. The sub-subhead reads: Meteoric Rise From Mailroom. The article is under the byline of Amy Archer. CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that we are looking at the newspaper OVER someone's SHOULDER. The person swivels around and away his face now TO us, we see that it is Norville looking at the newspaper. He throws his head back and laughs As he laughs thwock a steaming towel is thrown onto his face and he continues to swivel. CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that he is in a barber chair. His head drops back and OUT OF FRAME as the swiveling chair is cranked down, but immediately still spinning his head reappears as the chair is cranked up again. Still laughing, Norville is now freshly shaven and has a slicked-back haircut, heavy with pomade. FREEZE ON Norville's laughing face.
ANGLE: PULL BACK to reveal it is another front page photo next to the headline: Hud Board To Street: GIVE MAN FROM MUNCIE A CHANCE. Subhead: Has Fresh Ideas. CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that the paper is lying on a chair. Norville's mailroom apron is tossed onto the chair to cover it. PAN TO where the apron was tossed from. Norville stands on a tailor's stage, laughing, as the tailor, also laughing, takes his measurements. Norville in shirtsleeves, boxer shorts, hose stockings and garters. The tailor rises, laughing merrily, throwing up his arms and spreading them wide with hands stretching the measuring tape. Norville laughs merrily and also throws his arms up wide.
BOARD MEMBER: laughs merrily, his arms thrown wide, tickertape stretching between his hands. He joyously tosses away the tickertape.
FLOOR: where the tickertape lands on a pile of previously discharged PAN UP to reveal that the tickertape continues to burp its disastrous tale of good news for the board. PAN UP FURTHER to reveal that the machine is in Mussburger's office. At the far end of the room, behind his desk, Mussburger laughs as he looks at a newspaper. TRACK IN TOWARDS him. On his desk the perpetual ballbearings swing; outside his window the sweep second hand of the Hudsucker clock rumbles by, sweeping a shadow across the floor. Evil prevails. As Mussburger opens the newspaper, the CONTINUED TRACK IN shows its front page headline: HUD STOCK DIPS. Subhead: Just Good Is He? TRACK IN ON the front page photo: Norville laughing, his chin propped in his hand.
PHOTOGRAPH: COMES TO LIFE and Norville unfreezes, laughing. We are now TRACKING BACK FROM him. He sits behind a huge oak desk, newly coifed and tailored. The brass plaque on the desk confirms that he is in the OFFICE
EDITOR: 'The Einstein of Enterprise.' 'The Edison of Industry.' 'The Billion- Dollar Cranium'. 'Idea Man'! And not one of you mugs has given me a story on him!!
REVERSE: shows the Editors glassed-in office filled with REPORTERS for the staff meeting. Although they listen quietly, they are more bored than attentive. THROUGH the glass walls we can see the furious activity of an army of reporters, editors, and copy boys waging the never- ending battle to put out a quality daily newspaper. The Editor slams a newspaper down onto his desk in disgust.
EDITOR: Facts, figures, charts! They never sold a newspaper! I read this morning's edition of the Argus and let me tell you something: I'd wrap a fish in it! I'd use it as kindling! Hell, I'd even train my poodle with it if he wasn't a French poodle and more partial to the pages of Paree Soir! But I sure wouldn't shell out a hard-earned nickel to read the dadblamed thing!

PARKINSON: REPORTER NEXT TO HIM
EDITOR: The only thing that runs deep with Parkinson is the holes in his ears. Yes, the Idea Man! What're his hopes and dreams, his desires and aspirations? Does he think all the time or does he set aside a certain portion of the day? How tall is he and what's his shoe size? Where does he sleep and what does he eat for breakfast? Does he put jam on his toast or doesn't he put jam on his toast, and if not why not and since

OTHER REPORTER: Again? You're on.

AMY: .On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.

BUZZ: .and say, buddy! How'd old bucketbutt like his blue letter? Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Did he bust a gut? Did he die? Did he Well, hello, Mr. Mussburger, sir.
BUZZ: .How're you this fine morning,
NORVILLE: That reminds me, Mr. Mu. uh, Sid. I never did give you that
MUSSBURGER: ( to Buzz ) Lobby. We haven't got all day.
BUZZ: Right away, Mr. Mussburger sir.
MUSSBURGER: Well I'm starved. I understand it'll be quite an affair this afternoon, and the executive roast tom turkey at the Bohemian Grove redefines the word superb.
BUZZ: My pleasure, sir.
NORVILLE: Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry Sure, sure.
MUSSBURGER: Sure, sure.
BUZZ: It's been a pleasure serving you, Mr. Mussburger.
BUZZ: .and it's been a pleasure serving you too, uh. buddy.
MR. MUSSBURGER: is already striding through the lobby; Norville has to lope to catch up.
NORVILLE: Say, Mr. Muss uh, Sid! Shouldn't we be a little bit concerned with the downward spiral of our stock these last few days? I mean, you're the expert, but at the Muncie College of Business Administration they told
MUSSBURGER: Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
NORVILLE: Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but
NORVILLE: .You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off uh, the day I was promoted?
MUSSBURGER: I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment again, you're the expert here
NORVILLE: Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment again, you're the expert here
MUSSBURGER: Damnit, where's my car!
NORVILLE: But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics baby boom discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class
MUSSBURGER: So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch
NORVILLE: So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch
MUSSBURGER: Sure, sure, tell whoever you want. .And I'd like to hear more about it at some point, too.
MUSSBURGER: .And I'd like to hear more about it at some point, too.
NORVILLE: But, Sid, I thought you and I were.
DOORMAN: Say, bud, could you keep the sidewalk clear here?
NORVILLE: But I'm the president of this aww, forget it.
WAITRESS: ( bored, nasal voice ) Can I get you boys anything else?
REVERSE ANGLE: Back of the Waitress's torso in f.g.; on either side beyond her, the two Veterans are looking up at her O.S. face. They sport extremely bored expressions, topped by "cabbie" caps.
VETERAN #1: VETERAN #2
VETERAN #2: INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE Looking at its frosted-glass door; the sign painter is just finishing lettering in: NORVILLE BARNES, President. The sign painter makes way as we see Norville's shadow approaching; even from inside the room we can hear that he is WHEEZING HEAVILY. He is apparently carrying the girl, cradled in his arms. He tries to reach down to get the doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against the door and get the knob with his other hand. The door opens as Norville swings around to enter. He is wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode. He swings around to kick the door shut. We see that the lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see, in wet ink, on the seat of Norville's pants: senraB ellivroN Weakly, still cradled in Norville's arms:
AMY: I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy.
NORVILLE: Not at all. You're light as a feather.
AMY: ( pointing languorously ) The couch, please.
NORVILLE'S POV: She is smiling wanly AT the CAMERA. The entire IMAGE PULSATES as the blood pounds behind Norville's eyeballs. We hear the LOUD, RASPING of his BREATH, resonating inside his head. Amy is talking but her voice is barely audible, as if coming from a long way away.
NORVILLE: Just a minute.
AMY: I don't know what came over me. I suppose it was the shock of eating after so long without; the enzymes kicking in after so long, or whatever. But then you couldn't possibly know what it is to be tired and hungry.
NORVILLE: Hungry, anyway.
AMY: I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story. .Suffice it to say that I'm jobless though not for want of trying, that I'm friendless, with no one to thank you take care of me; and that had you not come along at just exactly the moment that you did Norville, I didn't know you were president here!
AMY: .Suffice it to say that I'm jobless though not for want of trying, that I'm friendless, with no one to thank you take care of me; and that had you not come along at just exactly the moment that you did Norville, I didn't know you were president here!
AMY: Norville, I didn't know you were president here!
NORVILLE: Oh, it's nothing really. Just determination and hard work.
NORVILLE: .Of course, when I started in the mailroom last Tuesday I thought it might take more time
BUZZ: Say, buddy, here's the whiskey you asked f
NORVILLE: ( flustered ) Thank you, Buzz, just leave it on the desk. Happy days, buddy.
BUZZ: Happy days, buddy.
BUZZ: .and I'll tell your secretary you're not to be disturbed. Yowzuh!!
AMY: ( shuddering ) What a horrible little person.
NORVILLE: Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really
AMY: At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world
AMY: A little naive perhaps but thank you armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future
NORVILLE: I myself
AMY: Only to have that belief, that unsullied optimism, dashed against the marble and mortar of the modern work place
NORVILLE: No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years
AMY: No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years
AMY: these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of
NORVILLE: Mind if I join you?
AMY: Be my guest. A little town you've
HIS POV: Once again her IMAGE PULSATES. There is a ROARING SOUND and an AIRY STEAM WHISTLE as she silently moves her lips.
NORVILLE: He waves his arms and talks with a thick rasp as he staggers to his Excuse me I executive
NORVILLE: Excuse me I executive
AMY: Are you all right?.
AMY: .Is it your lunch? The chicken a la king?
AMY: Is the a la king repeating on you?
AMY: Values. watchwords. uh, tender A little town you've probably never heard of.
AMY: .Muncie, Indiana. You're from Muncie?!
NORVILLE: You're from Muncie?!
AMY: Why yes, do you know it?
NORVILLE: 'Fight on fight on dear old Muncie Fight on Hoist the gold and blue You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you!'
NORVILLE: .Goooooooo Eagles!
NORVILLE: .A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
AMY: Oh, no, really, I
NORVILLE: Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
NORVILLE: .Mail room.
NORVILLE: .This'll only take a moment.
NORVILLE: Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
NORVILLE: .Well, I'm not sure where I
NORVILLE: But look, I'm president of the company now and I
NORVILLE: Oh, of all the foolish. Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
AMY: Of course I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
NORVILLE: A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
AMY: Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes
NORVILLE: Please! Norville!
NORVILLE: .It's my pleasure!
NORVILLE: .Gooooooo Eagles!
AMY: likewise hooks her thumbs in front of her nose, makes wings, and, winking back:
AMY: Gooooooooo Eagles! .Once 'The Munce'. Holy.
SMITTY: ( wheezing ) .Once 'The Munce'. Holy.
AMY: And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine
SMITTY: Behind her an ancient man wearing an inksman's visor and sleeve garters toils over a large checkerboarded surface over which he shuffles letter blocks and black spaces. Smitty gives a low whistle.
AMY: Behind her an ancient man wearing an inksman's visor and sleeve garters toils over a large checkerboarded surface over which he shuffles letter blocks and black spaces. Smitty gives a low whistle.
SMITTY: That gag's got whiskers on it!
AMY: I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something
SMITTY: ( into phone ) Say, Amy, what's a six-letter word for an affliction of the hypothalmus?
ANCIENT PUZZLER: Say, Amy, what's a six-letter word for an affliction of the hypothalmus?
AMY: And it's a cinch Goiter it's a cinch this guy isn't in on it. How much time to make the Late
SMITTY: Still typing, Amy whistles and nods to her shoulder. Smitty tucks the phone into it as she continues typing.
AMY: Hiya, Chief, just the person I wanted to apologize to.
SMITTY: About seven minutes.
AMY: ( still typing ) Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man. Well, thanks for being so generous. It is human, and you are divine. No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron
AMY: as in a five-letter word for
AMY: as pure a specimen as I've ever run across. Am I sure he's a nitwit? Heck, if working at the Argus doesn't make me an expert then my name isn't Amy Archer and I've never won the Pulitzer Prize.
AMY: .In 1957. My series on the reunited triplets come on down here, hammerhead, and I'll show it to ya.
ANCIENT PUZZLER: Amy, what's a three-letter word for a flightless bird?
AMY: Not now, Morris, I'm busy That's right, I said hammerhead, as in a ten-letter word for a smug bullying self-important newspaperman
AMY: Into phone:
AMY: who couldn't find
AMY: That's G-N-U
AMY: couldn't find the Empire State Building with a compass, a road map and a native guide.
AMY: or emu.
AMY: .And that's just the potatoes, Smitty, here comes the gravy: The chump really likes me. A Muncie girl!
SMITTY: Better off falling for a rattlesnake.
AMY: I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
SMITTY: He didn't offer you money.
AMY: A sawbuck!
SMITTY: Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
AMY: On Norville Barnes!
AMY: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:
PRESSES: rolling, churning out great quantities of newsprint. Papers piling up one on top of the other, very many, very DELIVERY MAN throwing a baled stack of papers off the back of his truck.
DELIVERY MAN: throwing a baled stack of papers off the back of his truck.
BALED PAPER: rolling into the f.g. A hand ENTERS FRAME to snip its wires and wipe off the top paper.
PAPER BOY: wearing an apron and a little paper boy cap, mouthing "Extra! Extra!" as he holds one of the papers aloft. PAN UP his arm TO the newspaper and, BEYOND it, the towering Hudsucker Building. All of the above
NEWSPAPER: spinning TOWARDS the CAMERA and STOPPING FULL FRAME. Its headline, over a picture of Norville smiling, is "IMBECILE HEADS HUDSUCKER." The subheadline: "Not a Brain in his Head."
NORVILLE: Miss Smith, can you come in please to take a letter.
NORVILLE: .of all the cockamamie.
NORVILLE: .Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
AMY: Well, I. didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
NORVILLE: The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible. Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence
AMY: or lack thereof?
NORVILLE: ( nodding ) these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et
AMY: Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
NORVILLE: .Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
AMY: I'm sure I
NORVILLE: Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your Well, I
AMY: Well, I
NORVILLE: Oh sure, you're biased you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
NORVILLE: .I designed it myself and this is just the sweet baby that can put Hudsucker right back on top.
NORVILLE: .You know! For kids!
AMY: .Why don't I just type this up.
NORVILLE: Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
AMY: Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
NORVILLE: Well, she probably had a deadline.
AMY: Sure, but she could still have gotten your side for the record!
NORVILLE: Well, it's done now what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam.
NORVILLE: .She's probably just a little
AMY: Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I I'm quite sure I don't know what you Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
NORVILLE: Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I I'm quite sure I don't know what you Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
AMY: ( through clenched teeth ) I'm quite sure I don't know what you Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
NORVILLE: Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
AMY: Oh, is that it!
NORVILLE: Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or.
AMY: Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
NORVILLE: Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
AMY: Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
NORVILLE: I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I
NORVILLE: .How about Oklahoma?
AMY: Norville Barnes, you don't know a thing about that woman! You don't know who she really is! And only a numbskull thinks he knows things about things he knows nothing about!
NORVILLE: Say, what gives?
WHISTLE: SWISH PAN TO:
CLOCK: Reading five o'clock.
WORKERS: Rising from their desks, collecting personal effects, putting on their hats and coats.
TIME CLOCK: Busy hands punch out.
BOOK: Still empty except for the one date with the Wilkie Grammer School Junior Achievers Club, which now has a red line drawn across it with the notation CANCELED.
AMY: looks around the office notices something.
DOOR: Set into the wall to one side it is topped by a small plaque:
HER POV: We are LOOKING INTO Sidney J. Mussburger's office. Mussburger sits at his desk barking into a Dictaphone. CLICK-CLICK-CLICK the PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS on his desk are going full-tilt; THRUMMMMMMM the CLOCK'S exterior second hand sweeps a shadow across the office. Mussburger, it seems, never sleeps.
MUSSBURGER: Memo. From the desk of Sidney J. Mussburger. Executive order number 530 slash A49. To: Director of the Jacksonville Facility. Copies to: Legal Affairs, Business Affairs, Central Files. Re: Movement of Raw Materials from the Huron Facility. Due to unfavorable news in the slag markets, Jacksonville inventory must be reduced by 15 percent with overflow diverted to the Waukegan Stamping Facility. Memo. From the desk of Sidney J. Mussburger. Executive order number 530 slash A50. To: Director Watchoo doin' down they, Miss Archuh?
AMY: She straightens and turns. Facing her is a very old BLACK MAN in a janitor's jumpsuit with HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES/The Future Is Now emblazoned across it. We might recognize his voice as that of the narrator who opened the movie.
AMY: Who are you? How did you know who I Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns But who are you what d'you do Ah keeps the ol' circle turning this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation
AMY: But who are you what d'you do Ah keeps the ol' circle turning this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation
MOSES: Ah keeps the ol' circle turning this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation
AMY: Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
MOSES: I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
AMY: So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
MOSES: Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
AMY: That smart?!
MOSES: But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
AMY: Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
MOSES: 'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does.
MOSES: .you know, fo' kids? Yeah, he's a smart one, that Norville, heh-heh, he's a caution. Wal, some folks is square, an' some is hip
MOSES: .But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
AMY: Well, maybe I
MOSES: An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh when she don't, uh How'd that go?
AMY: ( bristling ) It's hardly the same
MOSES: Why you don't even know y'own self you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
AMY: Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were
MOSES: I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
AMY: ( uncomfortably ) I'm happy enough.
MOSES: ( chuckles ) Okay, Miss Archuh. ( turns and walks away ) .I got gears to see to.
AMY: ( calls after him ) I'm plenty happy!
MOSES: Elsewhere in the great room, he is hunkered down next to a catchment which he buffs with a greasy rag. Amy's VOICE ECHOES
MOSES: ( muttering to himself ) Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat.
CHIEF: I can't print this!
AMY: Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
CHIEF: It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
SMITTY: ( chuckling ) Ol' satchel-butt.
AMY: I know they're gonna buy that stock
CHIEF: You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting I don't know.
AMY: I don't know.
SMITTY: Amy's hunches are usually pretty good, Chief.
CHIEF: You don't accuse someone of stock manipulation on a hunch, Ignatz! The readers of the Manhattan Argus aren't interested in sensationalism, gossip and unsupported speculation. Facts, figures those are the tools of the newspaper trade! Why it's almost as if you're trying to take the heat off this Barnes numbskull like you've gone all soft on him!
SMITTY: Come on, Chief, that's a low blow. Archer's not gonna go goey for a corn-fed idiot.
CHIEF: All right, I was out of line. But you're out of line with this stock swindle story. Gimme some more of that Moron-from-Sheboygan stuff
AMY: Whatever. That's what sells I've got an even hotter story The Sap from the City Desk.
CHIEF: Whatever. That's what sells I've got an even hotter story The Sap from the City Desk.
AMY: I've got an even hotter story The Sap from the City Desk.
CHIEF: Watch it, Archer
AMY: It's about a dimwitted editor who
SMITTY: Easy, Amy.
SMITTY: .Let's grab a highball and calm
AMY: Back off smoocher!
SMITTY: ( angry ) Say, what gives?
ENGRAVED INVITATION: IT READS: Sidney J. Mussburger President Norville Barnes and The Board of Hudsucker Industries CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO The Annual Fancy-Dress Hudsucker Christmas Gala Music, Dancing, Refreshments ( Dainties ) Formal Evening Attire de Rigeuer. The MUSIC OVER the invitation "WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS" SEGUES INTO the dance music of the Hudsucker Chamber Orchestra.
DANCING COUPLES: FILL the SCREEN; we GLIDE AMONG them and FINALLY COME to follow one couple: Norville and MRS. MUSSBURGER, a large middle-aged woman of the Margaret Dumont-mold in an elaborately flowered and old-fashioned evening gown, low-cut in spite of her overly-heavy figure. She wears a large flowered hat with a rolled-up veil.
MRS. MUSSBURGER: So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
NORVILLE: That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
MRS. MUSSBURGER: Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!
MRS. MUSSBURGER: I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
NORVILLE: I haven't had
MRS. MUSSBURGER: Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental Aren't we, dear?
MUSSBURGER: Sure, sure. I'm going to borrow Norville for a while, if you don't mind, dear.
MRS. MUSSBURGER: Well, frankly, I.
NORVILLE: You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss uh, Sid.
MUSSBURGER: So they tell me. Norville, let me shepherd you through some of the introductions here. Try not to talk too much; some of our biggest stockholders are, uh scratch that: Say whatever you want.
ENTRYWAY: As Amy enters in a simple yet stunning evening gown. She looks around the room, then starts across the crowded floor towards the punch bowl.
NORVILLE: As Mussburger introduces him to a tall, imposing BUSINESSMAN in a tuxedo and a ten-gallon hat.
MUSSBURGER: Norville Barnes, allow me to introduce Mr. Zebulon Cardozo, one of Hudsucker Industries largest and most loyal
NORVILLE: No need for concern, sir; it's only natural in a period of transition for the more timid element to run for cover
CARDOZO: So I'm yella, am I?!!
CARDOZO: .We'll see who's yella!!
MRS. CARDOZO: Zebulon, you mind now and quit bein' sech an ole grizzly.
CARDOZO: Aww, I wasn't gonna hurt the boy,
NORVILLE: I'm sorry, Sid, I thought maybe if I showed him the long view we might
MUSSBURGER: Norville, this is Thorstensen Finlandsen, who heads a radical splinter group of disgruntled
NORVILLE: Hello, Mr. Finlandsen, so sorry to meet you uh, happy to walk into y uh, pleased to make your

NORVILLE: .I understand your concern about the down-ward, you know, but I think you'll find under our strong new
MRS. FINDLANDSEN: There is a drum roll and, as the lights dim:
EMCEE: grabs the large old-fashioned microphone in front of the band and grins.
EMCEE: Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished members of the Hudsucker board. I give you the king of swing, the rajah of romance, the incredible, the unforgettable Mister Vic. Tenetta!
EXECUTIVE #1: How's it going, Mr. Mussburger?
MUSSBURGER: EXECUTIVE #2
EXECUTIVE #2: But not bad enough.
MUSSBURGER: But not bad enough.
EXECUTIVE #3: Too bad.
MUSSBURGER: It could be better, it could be worse.
MUSSBURGER: The stock's got to drop another five points if we expect to get controlling interest. Norville tells me he's got some hot idea. Can't be good.
EXECUTIVE #1: Then it can't be bad!
EXECUTIVE #2: Couldn't be better if it couldn't be
ALL: EXT. PENTHOUSE - TERRACE where the PARTY NOISE is DISTANT, TENETTA'S SONG just
REVERSE: Amy, having just emerged onto the terrace, squints at him.
AMY: He turns and we see that it is indeed Norville, holding a dripping icepack against one eye.
AMY: .What happened?
NORVILLE: Oh. Nothing, really, just. the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
AMY: Let me look.
NORVILLE: Sid found me the icepack.
AMY: Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
NORVILLE: Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
AMY: .I'm sorry.
NORVILLE: Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
AMY: Norville. there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
NORVILLE: I know that, Amy.
AMY: .You do?
NORVILLE: I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front not that everyone's buying it.
AMY: I believe in you, Norville At least I believe in your. Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people
NORVILLE: Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people
AMY: Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie.
AMY: .Certain people are
NORVILLE: Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
AMY: You know, on farm route 17.
NORVILLE: You know, on farm route 17.
AMY: Oh yes! In Muncie!
NORVILLE: No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
AMY: Uh Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I well no, I I never really. There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
NORVILLE: You don't say.
AMY: Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it why don't you come there with me they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
NORVILLE: ( puzzled ) Every year?
AMY: Well this year if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful
AMY: .The people look like ants.
NORVILLE: Well, the Hindus say and the beatniks also that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
AMY: What a beautiful thought.
NORVILLE: What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
AMY: Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys
NORVILLE: Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
AMY: Norville, there really is something I have to tell you
NORVILLE: That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways.
AMY: I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
NORVILLE: Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' the great circle of life, death and rebirth. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
AMY: Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
NORVILLE: That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve.
NORVILLE: .Tomorrow's my big presentation to the board. I've gotta show Sidney and the guys that I deserve all their Oh, Norville
AMY: Oh, Norville
NORVILLE: Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for Sure, Norville, sure.
AMY: Sure, Norville, sure.
AMY: .Oh, Norville!
VIC TENETTA: Crooning the end of his song.
DANCING COUPLES: Turn to the bandstand and applaud.
NORVILLE: So we have economy, simplicity, low production cost and the potential for mass appeal, and all that spells out great profitability.
BOARD: Staring, mouths hanging open, in arrested motion much like when Waring Hudsucker jumped out the window at the previous board meeting.
NORVILLE: .It's fun, it's healthy, it's good exercise; kids'll just love it, and we put a little sand inside to make the whole experience more pleasant. And the great part is we won't have to charge an arm and a leg!
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE: Yeah but. What is it?
EXECUTIVE #2: Does it have rules?
EXECUTIVE #3: Can more than one play?
EXECUTIVE #4: ( to #3 ) What makes you think it's a game?
EXECUTIVE #3: Is it a game?
EXECUTIVE #5: Will it break?
EXECUTIVE #6: It better break eventually!
EXECUTIVE #2: Is there an object?
EXECUTIVE #3: Are you supposed to make it fly off?
EXECUTIVE #5: Does it come with batteries?
EXECUTIVE #4: Could we charge extra for them?
EXECUTIVE #7: Is it safe for toddlers?
EXECUTIVE #3: How can you tell when you're done?
EXECUTIVE #2: How do you make it stop?
EXECUTIVE #1: Is that a girl's model or a boy's?
EXECUTIVE #3: Can a parent assemble it??
EXECUTIVE #7: What if you get tired before it's Is there a larger model for the obese?
EXECUTIVE #6: Is there a larger model for the obese?
EXECUTIVE #4: Can you do it around your neck?
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE: And finally. what is it?
NORVILLE: You know, for kids! It's. it's . well, it's.
MUSSBURGER: It's brilliant.
MUSSBURGER: .It's genius. It's just exactly what Hudsucker needs at this juncture. Sure, sure, a blind man could tell you that there's an enormous demand for this, uh.
MUSSBURGER: .Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh. with the, uh. that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
NORVILLE: Well. I'm for it.
TELETYPE: Furiously PRINTING out "EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVE #37451-JL7. A hand ENTERS FRAME and rips the directive from the teletype, then hurriedly rolls it into a cylinder and slips it into a cylindrical metal capsule. The capsule is popped into a pneumatic tube.
RENDERING: as a hand ENTERS FRAME and stamps the drawing approved.
PNEUMATIC PIPING: With the cylinder rocketing by.
HUGE POSTER: Up on the wall of the accounting floor is an enormous reproduction of the design department's rendering of the hula hoop. Over the poster is an enormous banner: "WHAT WILL
THIS COST?": PAN FROM the poster TO a HIGH ANGLE SHOT of a floor full of accountants sitting at their rows and rows of desks; all are looking up at the wall poster as they operate their manual adding machines to the same beat. All accountants wear identical vests, shirtsleeves, garters, visors and spectacles. The head accountant stands in front of the room overseeing their efforts. He wears a full three-piece suit, a visor and a pince-nez.
HUGE BOOK: Being dropped onto a desk. Its cover reads: SUMMARY OF COST
EXECUTIVE: Looking down at the book as the head accountant hovers over his shoulder, waiting for his reaction. The executive grimly shakes his head.
ROCKETING PIPES: CUT TO:
MEN: in asbestos suits throwing down their visors as they scurry and dive for cover behind banks of sandbags. A fierce EXPLOSION harshly illuminates the sandbags. As the EXPLOSION
THEIR POV: Bouncing among the flaming debris of the explosion is a hula hoop, still intact.
ROCKETING PIPES: CUT TO:
PAGE: being carried away in a continuous motion by an engineer who looks at it, nodding. We see that we are now in an enormous plant area. The engineer, grimy from his labors in this sweaty industrial realm, reaches up to pull an enormous lever.
MACHINES: GRINDING into motion.
DONUT SPOUT: As it begins to spit hula hoops in massive numbers. The hoops are spit onto a long metal arm where they rest, A bale of hula hoops is loaded into a Hudsucker truck to complete its load. The truck door is slammed shut.
IRON GRILL: is thrown up to reveal the display window of a shop just opening for the day. In the window is an enormous hula hoop display, with various hoops strung up on wire in front of a large cardboard diorama "You know. for Kids!" Reflected in the display window we see crowds of people scurrying by, indifferent to the display. Inside the shop we see the proprietor by the cash register, his chin propped glumly in his hands.
HULA HOOP: It rolls across the street. CARS VIOLENTLY BRAKE to avoid It rounds a corner and rolls up to a little boy, rolls in a circle around him, and finally wobbles to the pavement. The little boy looks at it, steps inside it, raises it to his hips and starts hula hooping. Somewhere a BELL is RINGING.
SCREAMING PACK: once again running, maniacal, possessed. We don't know where they are running, but we can guess.
STORE: Jam-packed with screaming children, grabbing hula hoops off the shelves.
AMY: Norville lifts his head from the desktop. A piece of scrap paper is sticking to his cheek. Dramatic FANFARE MUSIC STARTS
NEWSREEL TITLE: We can see the "Tidbits of Time" logo as a solemn-voiced announcer intones:

Cut to candid film of Norville getting out of a car, noticing the camera, grinning and waving as he walks, and taking a ANOTHER ANGLE A television sits against a neutral b.g.

NORVILLE: Facing a battery of REPORTERS at a news conference.
REPORTER #1: Mr. Barnes, how'd ya come up with the idea for the hula hoop?
NORVILLE: Well, it was no great idea, really. A thing like this, it takes a whole company to put it together, and I'm just grateful for the opportunity
REPORTER #2: Mr. Barnes, did you have any idea there'd be such a huge response?
NORVILLE: Well, frankly, I don't think anybody expected this much hoopla
REPORTER #3: 'Hoopla on the hula hoop' can we quote you on that, Mr. Barnes?
NORVILLE: Well sure, I guess
REPORTER #4: Mr. Barnes, are you thinking of giving yourself a nice fat raise?
NORVILLE: Ha-ha-ha-ha. Come on, guys.
NEWSREEL: A scientist with a Van Dyke beard, wearing a laboratory smock, is facing the camera. Behind him we see other scientists studying a hoop that has been hooked up to a gyroscopic- looking device that analyzes its various movements and A title supered over the Scientist's chest identifies him as Professor Erwin Schweide.
NEWS CONFERENCE: Newsmen follow Norville as he walks through the lobby of the Hudsucker Building.
REPORTER #1: Mr. Barnes, did the board consider you an 'idea man' when they promoted you from the mail room?
NORVILLE: Well, I guess so I don't think they promoted me because they thought I was a jerk.
REPORTER #2: Mr. Barnes, what's the next big idea for you and Hudsucker Industries?
NORVILLE: Jeez, I don't know. An idea like this sweet baby doesn't just come Mr. Barnes, are you
REPORTER: Mr. Barnes, are you
NORVILLE: Although I'll tell you one thing: I certainly didn't expect all this
NORVILLE: .And you can quote me on that!
NEWSREEL: ANNOUNCER ( V.O. )
ANOTHER ANGLE: A group of people in formal evening wear are sipping highballs and chatting as they keep hoops in motion 'round their waists.
ANOTHER ANGLE: A young couple stands before the altar hula hooping.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Pan down from elephant to two natives hula hooping as they grin into the newsreel camera.
ANOTHER ANGLE: The mean laugh. Yes, as we draw closer, it seems clear that his laugh is colder than before. Flash bulb explosion effects a.
NORVILLE: Sitting in a barber chair, face lathered up, as Reporters crowd in.
REPORTER #1: Mr. Barnes, Mr. Barnes, Rumpus magazine has called you the most eligible bachelor of the year, and the society pages have been linking you with high-fashion model Za-Za. Would you care to comment?
NORVILLE: There's no truth to the rumors; we're just dear friends.
NORVILLE: .Isn't that right, Za-Za?
REPORTER #2: REPORTER #3
REPORTER #3: Mr. Barnes, whither Hudsucker? Whither Norville Barnes?
REPORTER #4: How do you respond to the charges that you're out of ideas? Has Norville Barnes run dry?
NORVILLE: Not at all. Why, just this week I came up with several new sweet ideas. A larger model hula hoop for the portly. A battery option for the lazy and handicapped. A model with more sand for hard-of-hearing. I'm earning my keep.
REPORTER #5: Speaking of that, Mr. Barnes, do you expect to get a raise?
NORVILLE: Well, by anyone's account I've saved Hudsucker Industries; our stock is worth more than it's ever been. So, yes, I expect to be compensated for
ANOTHER ANGLE: The mean laugh. FURTHER TRACK IN ON Norville ENDS in CLOSE SHOT, his hands clasped on the desktop in front of him, as he finishes his hard, square-jawed, man-on-top laugh, gazing flintily INTO the CAMERA.
NORVILLE: PULL BACK FROM:
WEEPING EXECUTIVE: The PULL BACK FROM a blubbering executive REVEALS that we are at a Board meeting. All of the Board members sit around the table except for Mussburger, who, a towel around his waist, is receiving a choppity-chop massage on a padded table from a muscular man in a bulging T-shirt.
MUSSBURGER: Pull yourself together, Addison.
ADDISON: Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
MUSSBURGER: We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison
ADDISON: I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
MUSSBURGER: Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap
ADDISON: Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!
ADDISON: I'm getting off this merry-go-round!
EXECUTIVE: ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE: He runs down the length of the table and hurls himself toward the window and: MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE - ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE LOOKING IN, as Addison flattens against the f.g. glass, his face squushing, his outflung hands likewise. All stare in horror for a long silent beat. With the sound of a SQUEEGEE being drawn across glass, Addison, still frozen, slides down the window, hits the floor, and falls stiffly back like a fallen tree. Mussburger sits up and sticks a cigar into his mouth.

MUSSBURGER: Plexiglas. Had it installed last All right, so the kid caught a wave. So right now he and his dingus are on top. Well, this too shall pass. Myrtle J. Mussburger didn't raise her boy to go knockkneed at the first sign of adversity. I say, we made this kid and we can break him. I say, the higher he climbs, the harder he drops. I say, yes, the kid has a future, and in it I see shame, dishonor, ignominy and disgrace.

NORVILLE'S OFFICE: A small chamber orchestra, the musicians in tails, sit playing "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik". Norville, eyes closed, reclines in his desk chair, one uniformed woman stooping in front of him, manicuring his nails, another, behind, massaging his temples. A tailor is pinning up his pant cuffs. A French sculptor wearing a white smock, a beret, and a goatee squints at Norville and chisels at a block of marble with a stone chisel and hammer. A GOON sits off to one side, hat insolently atop his head, reading the funny papers. At length Norville stirs, opens his eyes, sits bolt upright, batting away the hands of the manicurist and temple-massager.
NORVILLE: Hold it!.
NORVILLE: .Nobody move, nobody breathe.
NORVILLE: .An idea. is coming.
NORVILLE: Deflates. He glares at the tailor.
NORVILLE: It's gone now.
NORVILLE: Is she in the book?
AMY: For Pete's sake, Norville!
NORVILLE: Oh! Hello, Amy was it I thought she said, Mamie
AMY: Never mind about that.
AMY: .You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
NORVILLE: Well, I wouldn't call them nincom
AMY: They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families
NORVILLE: Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if
AMY: You mean you know about this?
NORVILLE: Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
AMY: Your i
NORVILLE: We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker
AMY: You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of would you get out of here?!
AMY: .I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me
NORVILLE: Now, Aim
AMY: Shutup! and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile
NORVILLE: Now, Aim
AMY: Shutup! but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after
NORVILLE: Now, Aim
AMY: Shutup! after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you. if you.
NORVILLE: Worked in a watch factory?
GOON: ( to the Goon ) ( to Norville ) Exactly! Don't you remember how you used to feel about the hoop? You told me you were gonna bring a smile to the hips of everyone in America, regardless of race, creed or color. Finally there'd be a thingamajig that would bring everyone together even if it kept 'em apart, spacially you know, for kids? Your words, Norville, not mine. I used to love Norville Barnes yes, love him! when he was just a swell kid with hot ideas who was in over his head, but now your head is too big to be in over!

NORVILLE: Now, Amy
AMY: Consider this my resignation
GOON: Crack Amy kicks him hard in the shin.
GOON: Effective immediately!!
AMY: Effective immediately!!
WIDER ANGLE: We are in Mussburger's office. Mussburger is seated at his desk looking at the file picture and clipping; the sign letterer/scraper is leaning over his shoulder, having just put them down.
MUSSBURGER: Hmmm. Thank you, Aloysius. This may be useful.
PERFECT WHITE: After a beat, a woman ENTERS against the unblemished white background, dressed in a flowing white dance robe, trailing a long, diaphanous veil. She performs a flowingly sensuous dance moderne; the MUSIC is a sensuous saxophone solo with lasciviously bending blue notes. After the woman has been dancing for several beats Norville enters, dancing after her, pursuing her. He is wearing a coatless suit, his sleeves rolled up, his thin tie loosened. The woman dances around him, letting her diaphanous veil trail sinuously around his body. We hear an ECHOING voice:
NORVILLE: He opens his eyes and looks stuporously about. Buzz is grinning down at him in his little pillbox elevator Norville clears his throat.
BUZZ: Looks like ya nodded off there, buddy! Say, ya got a minute?
NORVILLE: Oh, uh. Buzz. Is it important?
BUZZ: I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
BUZZ: .Ya see, I don't intend to be an elevator boy forever! Take a look at this sweet baby!
BUZZ: .Ya get it, buddy? Incredibly convenient, isn't it? Ya see little ridges on the side that give it its whammy! See, ya don't have to drink like this anymore
BUZZ: this is how it works, it's these little ridges on the side that give it its whammy! See, ya don't have to drink like this anymore Now you can drink like this
BUZZ: Now you can drink like this
BUZZ: .I call it the Buzz-Sucker, get it, buddy? After me! Buzz! Why, people are just dyin' for a product like this, and the great thing is we won't have to charge an arm and a
NORVILLE: Wait a minute!
NORVILLE: .Why, this is worthless.
BUZZ: Huh?! But, buddy
NORVILLE: This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
BUZZ: Yeah, but, buddy
NORVILLE: Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh.
NORVILLE: .say, the hula hoop such a success.
BUZZ: But, buddy
NORVILLE: And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here
BUZZ: But, buddy, you were
NORVILLE: I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
BUZZ: Geez, I'm sorry, buddy
NORVILLE: An example must be made!
BUZZ: Wuddya mean, buddy?
NORVILLE: Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster! Awwww, buddy
BUZZ: Awwww, buddy
NORVILLE: And don't call me buddy! Out of here!
BUZZ: Aw, please, sir this job, it's all I got!
NORVILLE: Get up!
BUZZ: I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
NORVILLE: We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker
BUZZ: I'm sorry, buddy. I'm sorry.
NORVILLE: Buzz. off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
FLAMES: We PULL BACK FROM the flame of Sid Mussburger's oversized lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar. He is sitting alone in the boardroom, but its door swings open and Norville enters wearing plaid knickers, a little cap, and a knit shirt that shows his waist starting to bulge. He has a full golf bag over his shoulder.
NORVILLE: Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
MUSSBURGER: Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
NORVILLE: Ya don't say.
MUSSBURGER: Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but this is embarrassing, kid it seems to concern you How's that, Sid?
NORVILLE: How's that, Sid?
MUSSBURGER: It's not important in itself some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from Huh?! He no, I he's just maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I
NORVILLE: Huh?! He no, I he's just maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I
MUSSBURGER: Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems well, there was a spy in the company.
MUSSBURGER: .Sure, sure, we tried to kill the story. But her newspaper won't play ball. Looks like her story's coming
MUSSBURGER: .See, kid, the problem the Board'll have. you hired this woman. Kept her on, while she made a chump out of you. Serious error of judgment. I mean, business is war, kid ya take no prisoners, ya get no second chances. And a boner like this. I'm afraid when the Board meets, after New Year's, your position. well, it looks like you're finished. stick a fork in ya, you're done. washed up.
FAKE!: Next to the picture of Norville is the subhead: Idea Man a Next to the sub-subhead is a picture of Buzz in his elevator- operator's pillbox hat: Stole Hoop Idea from Genius Elevator Jockey Clarence "Buzz" Gunderson.

SMITTY: and she's dynamite!
AMY: But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it look at the man he's an imbecile!
CHIEF: Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it apparently he's some kind of prodigy

CHIEF: Smith has a source on the Hud board very senior, very hushhush
AMY: Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
SMITTY: You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it soft on the dummy from Dubuque
AMY: Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin'

CHIEF: ( gently ) Amy take a break. You've worked hard on this story heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.

BOARD MEMBER: Sitting in a darkened board room, gazing off at a screen that sends flickering light onto his face.
ANOTHER ANGLE: A shadow is thrown across the screen as a figure steps into the beam. He throws the sharp silhouette of a strict Freudian ANALYST: Van Dyke beard, pince-nez with chain trailing down to his vest, one thumb hooked into the vest, the other hand holding a cigar wreathing smoke, which he waves for emphasis.

REVELER #1: Happy Newby-Newby-New!
REVELER #2: 1959 we dig you the most!
NEWSPAPER: WIPES UP INTO FRAME. Next to a picture of Norville is the headline "MUNCIE MENTAL CASE." The subhead: "Hud Chief to Tend Daisies." Sub-subhead: "Headshrinker Calls Him Walking Time Bomb."
MUSSBURGER: .The barred-window boys are out looking for him now, and we'll see how Wall Street likes the news that the President of Hudsucker Industries is headed for the booby-hatch. Why, when the doc gets through with him he'll need diapers and a dribble
MUSSBURGER: .Let me remind you that our secret post-New Year's party will be held in the office of the President shortly after midnight tonight. Remember, it's strictly stag, so leave the wives at home; we'll be showing some films and, yes, gentlemen, there will be exotic dancers.
MUSSBURGER: Well, if that's all.
ALL: Long live the Hud!
NORVILLE: Norville trudges on, faster, sweatier.
NORVILLE: Uh. Buzz, I'm sorry, I Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I
BUZZ: Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
NORVILLE: .You don't?
BUZZ: Nah, that's all forgotten.
NORVILLE: .It is?
BUZZ: Sure, Mr. Muss uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
NORVILLE: Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he
BUZZ: But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
NORVILLE: But, Buzz
BUZZ: Say, that was a swell idea!
NORVILLE: But, Buzz, you know I never
BUZZ: And Sid says you stole it!
NORVILLE: But Buzz
BUZZ: Think about that, idea man!!
PASSERBY: Say, isn't he that lunatic?
VOICES: .that big-shot faker. the Wall Street fraud guy. nuttier than a fruitcake. they say he's a menace. wuddya waitin' for, call a cop!.
VOICES: .He's on his feet. We can take
NORVILLE: runs, gasping, turning a corner.
VOICES: .Down here! He went down here!
DRUNK: Ring out the old! Ring in the new!
LIMESTONE FLOOR: Norville, gasping, crashes down INTO FRAME, his hands breaking his fall against the limestone. The CAMERA SPINS NINETY DEGREES to reveal that it is not floor but wall he has run into and is now leaning against. Norville looks up, sweating, HIS POV The massive Hudsucker Building looms dizzily up towards the stars, capped by the huge Hudsucker Clock.
HIS POV: The massive Hudsucker Building looms dizzily up towards the stars, capped by the huge Hudsucker Clock.
HUDSUCKER LOBBY: Norville staggers in. A gust of icy air that comes in with him flaps a dropcloth off a huge shape that dominates the It is the heroic statue of Norville that we earlier saw him posing for. Norville reels over to it, stares dumbly.
STATUE: Mutely mockingly dignified.
NORVILLE: He staggers off to the elevators.
MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE: We are TRACKING ACROSS the office TOWARD Mussburger, his feet up on his desk, laughing demonically, smoking his cigar. CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK the PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS swing on his desk; THRUMMMMM the SWEEP SECOND HAND of the clock, illuminated now, casts a moving shadow that rolls across the floor. Evil prevails. A piece of paper and a pencil lie on his desk; as we APPROACH WE PAN DOWN and SWING AROUND to read it, LOSING Mussburger but still hearing his LAUGHTER.
NORVILLE: He pushes past the sign painter.
SYNE.": Norville has pulled his old mailroom apron from the closet and is putting it on: HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future Is Now. Norville looks at the door. THROUGH the glass we see the tail of the last R of "Mussburger" being painted into place. Norville throws open the window.
LEDGE: Norville, back against the wall, looks cautiously down. We hear DISTANT CHANTING:
HIS POV: A sickening drop. Receding snowflakes. On the street far, far below, a lone car's headlights cut through the falling
BONG!!: He can't stand it. Whimpering, hands to his ears, he edges his way back toward the window.
HIS POV: The open window at a steep angle. Someone inside slides it BACK TO SCENE Norville waves.
NORVILLE: His gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance he trips falls catches the ledge
BONG!!: His gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance he trips falls catches the ledge
NORVILLE: No, please!
HIS POV: Looking STEEPLY UP.
CLOCK: Its second hand is making its descent.
NORVILLE: SECOND HAND Falling, turning lazily in the air and suddenly, with a great moaning sound he stops, suspended in mid-air, head down, feet in the air. It is much like the freeze frame on Waring Hudsucker that the title of the film was supered over. He waves his arms, to no effect, looks around.
MUSSBURGER: SECOND HAND Falling, turning lazily in the air and suddenly, with a great moaning sound he stops, suspended in mid-air, head down, feet in the air. It is much like the freeze frame on Waring Hudsucker that the title of the film was supered over. He waves his arms, to no effect, looks around.

MUSSBURGER: In his office, frozen with an idiotic laugh pasted to his HIS PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS Frozen, one ball swung out but suspended, hanging at the apex of its arc. Outside the great arched window, snow falls.
NORVILLE: He alone can move, but doesn't fall. He looks awkwardly about, his body in a dive-bomber attitude, canted steeply down.
MOSES: Strictly speakin', I'm never spozed to do this but. have you got a better idea?
NORVILLE: Twisting back to look up over his shoulder; there is a DISTANT very distant SINGING.
HIS POV: Looking up the length of the Hudsucker Building. Someone or something wrapped in white is flying toward us, coming down from the stars. We can make out a male voice, accompanied by STRUMMING:
NORVILLE: He gapes.
ANGEL: For it is an Angel, arrives. He is a balding man, wearing rimless glasses, in a white robe, large feathery wings sprouting from his back and beating heavily until he comes to rest, in midair. He puts aside the harp he has been strumming on a nearby windowsill.
ANGEL: Love that tune. How ya doin', kid?
NORVILLE: Mr. Mr. Hudsucker?
HUDSUCKER: He rights himself. The halo spinning lazily over his head has been jarred askew. With a flick of his forefinger he rights it.
HUDSUCKER: .How d'ya like this thing? They're all wearin' em upstairs now.
HUDSUCKER: .It's a fad.
HUDSUCKER: .Anyway. I hear you've been having,
HUDSUCKER: .Been having some problems with the board. The more things change, know what Iyayayeeeeee.
HUDSUCKER: .Jesus Christopher That smarts. Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
NORVILLE: Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
HUDSUCKER: Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
NORVILLE: Yes sir.
HUDSUCKER: Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
NORVILLE: Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
HUDSUCKER: It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
NORVILLE: Oh, geez.
HUDSUCKER: Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
NORVILLE: Geez, I
HUDSUCKER: Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
NORVILLE: Well, why don't ya read it.
HUDSUCKER: Well, why don't ya read it.
NORVILLE: Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
HUDSUCKER: Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
NORVILLE: Yes sir.
NORVILLE: 'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I
HUDSUCKER: Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate go down to the second paragraph.
NORVILLE: 'Many years, uh. I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
NORVILLE: '.Looking back now, Sid, I see that I allowed time and age to corrupt my dreams. Instead of fiercely guarding what was timeless inside of myself, I let the hubbub of earthly commerce erode my character, and dissolve my better self. How is it that some manage to preserve themselves where I have failed? Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if others love you, you may more securely love yourself but I am alone. I loved a woman once, Sid, as you well know a beautiful, vibrant lady, an angel who in her wisdom saw fit to choose you instead of I.'
HUDSUCKER: Skip this part.
HUDSUCKER: .Last paragraph, last paragraph.
NORVILLE: '.And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But '
HUDSUCKER: tough titty toenails!
HUDSUCKER: .That'll show the bastard!
HUDSUCKER: .Yeah, go ahead.
NORVILLE: '.But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring
HUDSUCKER: Pleased with himself:
HUDSUCKER: Yup. It's all there. Well, see that it gets delivered in the morning. Sheeel beeee.
HUDSUCKER: Sheeel beeee.
MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE: Mussburger still sits frozen in his chair. Outside the great arched window Hudsucker rises, through the falling snow, on his way back to the heavens.
HUDSUCKER: .Ridin' six white horses, She'll be ridin' six white horses She'll be ridin' six white horses When she
GEAR ROOM: Moses pries the broom handle loose from the Great Gear. With a LOW MOAN the CLOCKWORKS start to shudder and turn
BOOM DOWN: FROM a tavern sign that says ANN'S 440, DOWN TO the front door, which Norville is entering.
BARTENDER: You cats comin' from a party?
BENNY: Cabbies' affair.
LOU: Hacks' New Year's gala.
BARTENDER: Crazy. Get you anything else? Sangria? Carrot juice? Herbal tea?
REVERSE ANGLE: We see Benny and Lou are sitting side by side at the bar. Lou wears a fake whispy beard and white eyebrows and a long flowing robe; he holds a fake scythe. On the bar next to him sits a large hourglass.
LOU: Benny is wearing nothing but an oversized diaper, a baby bonnett and a sash across his hairy chest and thick belly that says "1959." He chucks himself in the heart, cocks his head and sucks in air, then blows it back out.
BENNY: BLUE LETTER Lying on the boardroom table. As a hand enters to lay a wristwatch on the table next to it, we hear the voice of Moses, the old maintenance man.
BLUE LETTER: Lying on the boardroom table. As a hand enters to lay a wristwatch on the table next to it, we hear the voice of Moses, the old maintenance man.
BARRED DOOR: being slammed behind Sidney who, straight-jacketed, is puffing on a cigar as he is led away.
BOARDROOM: Again. Norville is eagerly pointing at a design he has up on an easel: Under the heading BRAND NEW is a large circle. The side view is a flat line.
OUTSIDE: As it floats out the boardroom window.
THE END: Writers : Joel Coen Ethan Coen Sam Raimi
