HENRY'S CRIME: Written by Sacha Gervasi
A CAR: Approaches. Henry straightens, slides open his window. But the CAR veers over to the automated EZ-PASS LANE. Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear. He downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the horizon again. It's cloudy out there.
A CLOCK: flips to 6:00.
HENRY: Smells good.
DEBBIE: Sit down. He sits. She smiles. Starts buttering the toast.
HENRY: Wow. Thanks. He digs in.
DEBBIE: How was your night?
HENRY: Good. How was yours? She's still buttering the toast. Carefully.
DEBBIE: She sets it down.
HENRY: This is great. She sits down next to him. Watches him eat.
DEBBIE: I already did. He takes another bite.
HENRY: You okay?
DEBBIE: Are you coming with me to Cindy and Bill's on Saturday?
HENRY: Sure. What time? For the baby shower.
DEBBIE: For the baby shower.
HENRY: She just stares at him.
DEBBIE: Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime. Henry. Isn't it time.isn't it time for us? Henry stops eating.

HENRY: I love kids. He looks down, resumes eating. A beat.
DEBBIE: He looks up again.
HENRY: Of course I do. She looks at him.
DEBBIE: Because I know you did once. A very long pause. Henry doesn't do anything now. She's crestfallen.
EDDIE: Henry Torne.
HENRY: Eddie Vibes.
EDDIE: So how you doin', man?
HENRY: I'm okay. What's going on?
EDDIE: Listen, I got a man down here.
DEBBIE: He's hot. He starts to retch.
JOE: ( holding it in ) I'm sorry.
DEBBIE: You better come with me. Eddie glances at Henry as Debbie leads him expertly toward the bathroom.
EDDIE: Goddamn sausage at Pinwheels.
HENRY: So we're in a little bind, Henry. Got league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's our first baseman. And he's not exactly game-ready as you can see.
EDDIE: So we're in a little bind, Henry. Got league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's our first baseman. And he's not exactly game-ready as you can see.
HENRY: Eddie stares at him. Smiles.
EDDIE: So, what do you say?
HENRY: What do I say what?
EDDIE: You feel like playing a little ball? Filling in for Joe?
HENRY: It's November.
EDDIE: Yeah. They keep the field in perfect So what do you say? Henry looks around the room. For a moment he watches Debbie with Joe in the bathroom, the door half open. She's tending to him, caring for him. Debbie looks up. Sees Henry staring at her.

EDDIE: Appreciate you driving, man.
HENRY: So where's this game?
EDDIE: Near Kaisertown. Like fifteen minutes.
EDDIE: Pull up right over here. We gotta grab some beer money at that ATM. The car pulls up to a row of stores including the FIRST
BEHIND HIM: In the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two guys slipping on SKI MASKS.
HENRY'S POV: A PET STORE OWNER rolls up the security gates of his store and enters. He says good morning to all the animals. It's a strange one man show.
A GUN: Is pointing at him through the windshield.
DETECTIVE: Henry, we know this wasn't your deal.
JUDGE: .the court sentences Henry Torne to four years in prison for the crime of Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery.
WHACK!: The gavel goes down. Henry blinks. He looks at his lawyer who is pleased with the sentence. He pats Henry, well done. Henry looks back at Debbie. She's just staring at him.
CLANK!: A CELL DOOR is SLAMMED SHUT.
HENRY: I said what are you in for? A beat.
MAX: I said what are you in for? A beat.
HENRY: Bank robbery. MAX ( 60s ) pulls up his pants, flushes the TOILET.
MAX: Good. Clean. Simple. I like it. Henry just watches.
HENRY: But I didn't do it. Max smiles. Goes to the sink. Washes his hands.
MAX: Ah. Mistaken identity. A perennial favorite. Identities are just constructs, anyway. They're mistaken all the time. He dries his hands. Presents one of them to Henry.
HENRY: Go on. Make yourself at home. Henry sits down on his bed.
MAX: Go on. Make yourself at home. Henry sits down on his bed.
HENRY: So.what are you in for?
MAX: A beat. It's starting to hit Henry.
MAX: Hurry up. We gotta go. Henry's disoriented.
MAX: `Monday is whole wheat bun-day.' Henry's lost in thought.
HENRY: You're thinking something. Let me guess. You're thinking, `How did I get here?' Henry puts out his tray.
MAX: You're thinking something. Let me guess. You're thinking, `How did I get here?' Henry puts out his tray.
HENRY: I'm not sure.
MAX: I'll tell you how. Because we committed crimes. But we committed to the wrong thing. You see that was our mistake. We didn't fulfill our potential, we got angry and we took it out on other people. A bald, TATTOOED GANG-BANGER walks right past them to a table.
MAX: That's the real crime, Henry. Not committing to your dream. They begin to eat.
HENRY: My what?
MAX: Your dream.
HENRY: Not sure I ever had one.
MAX: Never had a dream? What kind of a life is I don't know. A pretty good one?
HENRY: I don't know. A pretty good one?
MAX: Henry, you're in jail. Henry thinks about that. Puts a piece of potato in his mouth.
MAX: But here's the good news. We got all this time to do. And time is a medium of exchange. You can buy things with it.
HENRY: I told you. I'm here by mistake. Max shoots a look back at him.
MAX: There are no mistakes. Max suddenly glimpses some activity over Henry's shoulder.
HENRY: Several convicts are making their way towards them. He pulls Henry close, his tone suddenly intense :
MAX: But you're going to have to fight for that dream, Henry.
HENRY: I am.
MAX: You're at a crossroads now. There are going to be tests!
HENRY: What tests?
CRAACK!: Henry's punched in the side of the head. The inmates grab him, throw him to the ground next to Max.
MAX: This is your moment. Whatever you do now defines you. Go get em! Henry gets up : CHARGES the inmates, arms swinging, taking several down. He gives it everything he's got. They pile into him, pummeling him. Henry just keeps fighting.but it's hopeless. GUARDS rush in. Max watches.
MAX: You did good, Henry.
HENRY: I don't feel good.
MAX: You're doing better than you feel. Henry touches his swollen eye. It stings.
DEBBIE: Hi. You look beautiful.
HENRY: Hi. You look beautiful.
DEBBIE: Thank you. How are you doing?
HENRY: I'm okay. How about you?
DEBBIE: I'm good. A beat.
HENRY: I fell in love. Henry takes that in.
DEBBIE: I fell in love. Henry takes that in.
HENRY: I just.I mean it just happened. Okay. Wow.
DEBBIE: I just.I mean it just happened. Okay. Wow.
HENRY: Okay. Wow.
DEBBIE: I'm sorry, Henry.
HENRY: It's alright.
DEBBIE: You're not mad? He thinks.
HENRY: He looks at her.
DEBBIE: You too, Henry. No one moves.
MAX: I ever tell you I was married? Henry turns to him.
HENRY: Books and covers.
MAX: Right. Books and covers.
MAX: Clean as a whistle.
FINK: ( checking himself out ) Max, I think you missed your calling.
MAX: Thank you.
HENRY: Hector. You're up. Standing just outside, A GUARD watches the make-shift barbershop carefully. Hector takes his seat. Max wraps a sheet around his neck.
HECTOR: Hey, Max. When are you up for parole?
MAX: Show us what you did for the board last I'm working. The other INMATES egg him on.
HECTOR: Show us what you did for the board last I'm working. The other INMATES egg him on.
MAX: I'm working. The other INMATES egg him on.
OTHER INMATES: Show us!
MAX: Leave me alone.
INMATES: Come on! Show us. Max finally puts his clippers down.
MAX: All right, so I'm sitting there, and the head of the board asks me what I'm going to do if they let me out this time. And, Max's face starts to shudder.his shoulders jerking back a little bit.
HECTOR: Hey, White Shadow. When's your review coming up?
HENRY: Next month.
HECTOR: You gonna do the twitch like your cellie?
HENRY: What, you don't like it around here?
HECTOR: What, you don't like it around here?
MAX: Everyone knows Henry's innocent. The board don't like it when you deny the I didn't do the crime.
HECTOR: ( TO HENRY )
HENRY: I didn't do the crime.
HECTOR: Hey, but you got the time.so you may as well have done it. Everyone laughs.
MAX: I like it! `You got the time, so you may as well have done the crime!' Everyone laughs again.
HENRY: Yeah, you're right. Henry ponders.
HENRY: You know you never did tell me what your dream was, Max.
MAX: I'm living it.
HENRY: Sure! It's easier to live in here. You don't have to do anything. You just show up. In fact they even do that for you. I'm living the life.
MAX: Sure! It's easier to live in here. You don't have to do anything. You just show up. In fact they even do that for you. I'm living the life.
HENRY: This place is horrible, Max. Max thinks, lathering his hair.
MAX: So why didn't you just say something?
HENRY: Back then. When you had the chance. When you were still innocent.
MAX: Back then. When you had the chance. When you were still innocent.
HENRY: I thought maybe this was my way out.
MAX: And was it?
HENRY: See. There are no mistakes.
MAX: See. There are no mistakes.
MAX: You got everything, kid?
HENRY: Henry, silent for a moment.
MAX: The only thing I've ever missed in twenty three years is a hot bath. And that ain't worth walking out of here for. The cell door slides open.
MAX: Don't forget. Your dream is your myth is your truth. I thought it was my dream is my truth is my destiny.
HENRY: I thought it was my dream is my truth is my destiny.
MAX: Just testing. Henry continues.stops at the door.
HENRY: I'm going to miss you.
MAX: Yeah, well. I hope I never see you again. Henry smiles.
HENRY: I'm still gonna miss you.
MAX: Get out of here, Henry.

ARNOLD: But I was
DAREK: Not you. You're doing the best you can. He points to JULIE.
JULIE: Listening? You look like you're hearing. To hear is to be weak. To listen is to be strong. To listen is an action. Julie cocks her ear, mockingly. Darek marches up to her.
DAREK: Listening? You look like you're hearing. To hear is to be weak. To listen is to be strong. To listen is an action. Julie cocks her ear, mockingly. Darek marches up to her.
JULIE: An action. I'm listening. Is this what you mean, Darek? Is this what you want?
DAREK: No, Djula.
JULIE: Then what do you want? They stare each other down.
DAREK: I want you to be more. I want you to be better than that. He snatches the cup from her hand.
JULIE: Fine. I'll go drink coffee. Julie marches off stage.
DAREK: I'll go drink coffee too! Let's all `go drink coffee'.
ASSISTANT ): Olga! Coffee. Coffee for everyone. We'll all have coffee Djula! Every single one of us! And think about what we want!

HENRY: Doesn't look like you.
JULIE: No, I meant the poster.
HENRY: Oh. It's funny.
JULIE: Actors on a tree is funny?
HENRY: She smiles. Pierre puts the coffees down on the bar.
JULIE: That's the director's joke. She starts dropping cubes of sugar in her cup.
HENRY: The irony is, he loves the American dream. I mean that's why he's here, But I know for a fact he hates himself for loving it. It's always an inside job, isn't it?
JULIE: The irony is, he loves the American dream. I mean that's why he's here, But I know for a fact he hates himself for loving it. It's always an inside job, isn't it?

MAX: Where's the car?
HENRY: I don't have a car.

MAX: ( reads the label ) Ah. The land of milk and honey. Pours it into his bath.
MAX: What is this obsession with coffee, Henry? When did that happen?
HENRY: I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give people a lot of purpose. They walk into the Cafe Orpheum.
MAX: Oh my God. Are you kidding? This was eighty years ago. It's ridiculous. Oh my God. That tunnel's probably not even there anymore! Are you dreaming, Henry?
HENRY: It's a start.
MAX: A start? This was your plan? An old cartoon in a pissoir?
HENRY: It's an article.

JULIE: He used to perform here.
SIMON: I don't see why not. We're on a break.
MAX: That okay, Henry?
HENRY: Sure. Go ahead. Julie and Henry watch them go.
JULIE: Is that your dad?
HENRY: No. He's a friend.
JULIE: He seems like your dad. Henry walks out onto the stage where Max was standing, getting the feel of it.
HENRY: It's peaceful out here. Is it fun?
JULIE: Pretending to be other people. She thinks.
HENRY: Pretending to be other people. She thinks.
JULIE: It's not really like that. I don't pretend to be someone else. I find some part of me, and reveal it in a new way.just inside of a character.
HENRY: So, in a way, you're still playing `you'.
JULIE: Yes. Exactly. In a way.
HENRY: So what part of `you' are you playing That's the question you always have to ask yourself.
JULIE: That's the question you always have to ask yourself.
MAX: Ah, the inner sanctum. The magic before the magic! I remember it like it was They enter the Green Room where ARNOLD is holding court.

HENRY: If you did we'd be able to get into that tunnel whenever we want.
MAX: If you did we'd be able to get into that tunnel whenever we want.
HENRY: I'm not an actor.
MAX: You're not a bank robber either! And you're doing that.
HENRY: Max. Come on.
MAX: She said you were a natural. That means you can do it.
HENRY: No, it doesn't.
MAX: Yes, it does Henry.
HENRY: I can't be Lophakin. They have a Max thinks.

MAX: You said he was a natural.
JULIE: Stan. Let me call you back. ( she hangs up, to Max ) Henry what?
MAX: Henry what?
JULIE: Henry what?
MAX: Henry would be perfect for it.
JULIE: Perfect for what?
MAX: For Lophakin. It takes a moment till her mind gets a hold of the idea.
JULIE: You mean Henry should play Lophakin?
MAX: She laughs.
JULIE: He's not even an actor!
MAX: Exactly. He'd be playing himself. ( off her shocked look ) Think about it Julie! He is Lophakin.
JULIE: Why do I feel like the earth is suddenly shifting under my feet?
MAX: Fact is you need a Lophakin and Lophakin needs a dressing room.
JULIE: What's going on here, Max? What are you She regards him. Suspiciously.
MAX: She regards him. Suspiciously.
JULIE: You made this happen, didn't you?
MAX: Sometimes a good guy needs a less good guy to help the good guy be good. He smiles. A beat : She SLAPS him hard across the cheek.
JULIE: What am I supposed to do now?
MAX: He just needs a shot. One audition. Let the chips fall where they may.
JULIE: What if it doesn't work?
MAX: They'll get someone else. She thinks.
JULIE: Okay, confidence man.
DAREK: Circles HENRY.walking around him.an animal tracking its pray.he's chain-smoking.
DAREK: .you've never had any training.you've never been in a production.you don't even know the play.
HENRY: I read it. I think I know the scene.
DAREK: He glances at Julie. Then back at Henry.
HENRY: ( READING )
DAREK: How can you perform Chekhov and not be able to say AND-REY-E-VICH! Now say it!
HENRY: Darek nods, continue :

JULIE: Show me, tell me. Darek laughs, circling. Henry takes her hand now.his voice drops.
HENRY: Good God in Heaven. My father was one of your father's serfs, and your grandfather's serf before that. But you, you did so much for me in the old days that I've forgotten all that. His yearning is suddenly palpable. Intense. Tender.

DAREK: Darek considers him.
JULIE: Does this make me an accessory?
HENRY: I think so. A beat.
JULIE: Things have certainly gotten a lot more interesting since you showed up.
HENRY: You mean since you ran me over. She smiles.
JULIE: So why are you robbing the bank, Henry? He doesn't answer.
HENRY: So why are you doing it? It takes a moment for him to answer.
JULIE: So why are you doing it? It takes a moment for him to answer.
HENRY: I used to sit in that toll booth and think about just getting in one of those cars, going wherever they went. Just joining someone else's life.
JULIE: You were asleep at the wheel. Henry smiles.
HENRY: Yeah, I was.
JULIE: Which was?
HENRY: That I was going along with everything. I didn't know I could change it.
JULIE: Robbing the bank is changing it?
HENRY: It already has. She gets the honey out of the cupboard. Pours some in her What was your wife like?
JULIE: What was your wife like?
HENRY: A beat.
JULIE: Not for a girl like me, Henry.
DAREK: This is Mr. Henry Smith. He will be taking over the role of Lophakin. If you He leads a light round of applause. Henry acknowledges
HENRY: Thanks. Thank you. Looking forward.
DAREK: Top of act three. Twenty minutes. Olga, Henry walks briskly away. Julie watches him.
WHACK!: He POUNDS the wall AGAIN and AGAIN.
MAX: Tracks! Trolley tracks! The beam scours the blackness ahead looking for the end..and there it is. A soot-covered WALL maybe ten feet ahead. They reach it. Henry touches the damp, decrepit brick, turns to Max.
HENRY: There's still twenty feet to go. He turns back to him :
HENRY: That's him.
MAX: That's him? Henry and Max watch as JOE grabs his head, flops into a chair. Max looks concerned.
HENRY: Thanks for meeting us.
JOE: Joe is looking worse for wear.
HENRY: How's your pyramid scheme?
JOE: It wasn't a pyramid scheme.
HENRY: Joe hits his Schooner Longneck.
JOE: It all fell apart.
MAX: What's he talking about?
HENRY: See what happens when a person tries to go `legit'?
MAX: See what happens when a person tries to go `legit'?
JOE: See what happens when a person tries to go `legit'?
HENRY: So how's Debbie?
JOE: She's worried, Henry. The baby's due in a couple months. He grabs a wing. Rips off the meat.
HENRY: She's pregnant?
JOE: Yeah, she's pregnant.
HENRY: Thanks, Henry.
JOE: Thanks, Henry.
HENRY: Come on. This is great news. ( off Joe's hopeless look ) It's going to be okay.
JOE: Really? It is? You know how much diapers cost? You know how much it costs to send a kid to college?
MAX: You want to send your baby to college? Joe keeps going on the wings. He's making a meal of it.
JOE: Of course not. I'm just saying. The kid needs stuff. Stuff that's expensive. Stuff it deserves.
HENRY: Listen, Joe, maybe we can help. A beat.
JOE: ( WIPING OFF )
HENRY: We might have a job for you. Max shoots a look at Henry. Joe chugs a glass of water, looking at both of them now.
JOE: No foolin'?
HENRY: There's maybe twenty feet till the bottom of that vault.
JOE: That's a lot of dirt, Henry. Max studies Joe.
HENRY: So what do you think?
JOE: I think we should get some guns and go get the money through the front door!
HENRY: No guns. People could get hurt.
JOE: What about fake ones?
HENRY: They're still guns.
MAX: Listen Joseph, guns are dangerous and we're not doing a simple hold-up. Tellers and tears and chump change. We're doing an old fashioned heist. We're going right into the belly of the beast.
ON JOE: Considering it. He picks up a shovel and CRUNCHES into the wall of dirt.
JOE: I hope we don't get caught.
JULIE: I hate that commercial.
HENRY: I like it. She looks at him.
JULIE: So what's your plan?
HENRY: For what?
JULIE: For when it's done. After. ( making light of it ) Am I going to see your picture in the post office or something?

JULIE: Because life is fucked. It never works out the way you want it to. Yeah. Well. Maybe.
HENRY: Yeah. Well. Maybe.
JULIE: Right! On the lam? You're dreaming.
HENRY: It was just an idea. Why not
JULIE: This isn't going to work out, Henry. She turns to face him.
HENRY: I didn't.
JULIE: I did. I think you should leave. Henry just stands there.stunned.
MAX: Palm trees. Sandy beaches. All you can eat sunshine. Grapefruits as big as your Henry sits across from him.
HENRY: Why couldn't I have met her after?
MAX: Julie. I asked her to meet me. After we're done.
HENRY: Julie. I asked her to meet me. After we're done.
MAX: Oh yeah? What'd she say?
HENRY: She said no.
MAX: Of course she said no.
HENRY: Why of course?
MAX: Because life ain't like that. There's always a cost. That's why they call it life. You got to pay somewhere. The piper must be paid to pipe.
HENRY: I paid already, Max.
MAX: Who's that?
HENRY: I'll check. Henry walks to the door.
EDDIE: The same bank. Shit, Henry. Now that's poetry! I like it.
MAX: Who is this guy? Eddie beams at Max.
EDDIE: Your new partner. Max looks at Henry : `huh?'
MAX: What do you mean?
EDDIE: I'm in. Or you're out.
JOE: I screwed up. Sorry, Max. Joe lies down on the floor. He's drunk as a skunk.
EDDIE: ( amused by the whole thing ) Joe tells me you guys might need a little help with that vault. I know the whole story.
MAX: Joe doesn't know what he's talking about. He's a drunk. He made a mistake. Get out of that chair. Eddie laughs. Leans back on it.
EDDIE: Relax, old man. Henry and I go way back. We've known each other since high school, isn't that right?
HENRY: Yeah. I know you.
EDDIE: Appreciate you keeping your mouth shut, Henry. One thing I admire in a man is the quality of loyalty.
HENRY: What do you want, Eddie?
EDDIE: Nothing. Just the American dream.
MAX: I'm gonna kill him. With a knife.
HENRY: You can't kill him.
JOE: ( slurred, on the floor ) Yeah. You can't kill him, Max. He's got the vault
MAX: Shut up, Joe.
JOE: Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's born. Says the kid'll know about it.
MAX: Go home. Please. Before it's too late.
TROFIMOV: I'm sorry to be blunt, but, for God's sake, the man has robbed you.
MADAME RANEVSKY: ( stopping her ears ) No! No! No! Don't say that!
TROFIMOV: He's a scoundrel: everybody knows it but you. He's a petty scoundrel, a user. ON HENRY, feeling like the accused. From the stage Julie sees him.
MADAME RANEVSKY: You are twenty six or twenty seven, and you're still in the lower grades!
TROFIMOV: Who cares? She locks eyes with Henry now :
MADAME RANEVSKY: You ought to be grown up by now. At your age, you ought to understand about love
DAREK: Where are you, Djula? Where?!
MADAME RANEVSKY: ( with double the fire ) You ought to love someone yourself! You ought to have an affair. Yes! Yes!
DAREK: Yes. Yes. Good Djula! Scene.
HENRY: What happened last night?
JULIE: I came to my senses.
HENRY: We should talk about it. She turns.
JULIE: I don't want to, Henry.
MAX: ( tugging the pulley ) Three feet of it so far today. We'll make it. Henry goes to the open doors of the Armoire. The tunnel is deeper now and all lit up.
JOE: What do you think guys? If it's a boy do I cut him or not?
MAX: Well, you know what they say, cleanliness is next to Godliness.
JOE: What do you say, Henry? Before he can answer :
FRANK: Now I see you coming out of the theatre behind the bank. Frank sucks his teeth.
MAX: In on what? Frank snickers.
FRANK: We can't talk here. Let's drive. Max looks at Henry.
HENRY: What's on your mind, Frank?
FRANK: The I.C.R.E. Indigenous Currency Retrieval and Exchange. They exchange glances.
MAX: Hypothetically say you were right about what we're up to.which you're not. But just say.why would you help us rob your I got my reasons.
FRANK: I got my reasons.
JOE: This sounds like a set-up, man Frank grabs Joe. Glares into his eyes.
FRANK: I don't fuck around, kid. I told you. I got my reasons.
MAX: Well, forgive us, Frank. But we're going to need to hear them. A beat.
FRANK: The wife got sick a few years ago. Insurance wouldn't pick up all the costs. So I went to the bank. They wouldn't help cover the difference. We were going to retire to the Loire valley.
JOE: ( GETTING IT )
FRANK: I spent everything we had then she died.thirty years I've been at that What was her name?

HENRY: Maybe we should wait. Do it closing Max turns.
MAX: We can't. He's retiring. This is a one time deal.
REVEAL HENRY: Walking down a corridor toward a NURSE'S STATION at the far end. The doors open for him.he hesitates
HENRY'S POV: DEBBIE in profile, smiling and talking to a seated receptionist who touches her very pregnant belly. Henry takes a step back, the doors close. He watches through the glass a moment. Debbie looks radiant. Peaceful. Happy.
HENRY: Walks back outside again. It's as if he got all the answers he needed.
MAX: There he is!
HENRY: He turns to Max.
JOE: The girl He throws down his shovel.
MAX: The girl He throws down his shovel.
ON HENRY: Hey! I think I got something. Joe furiously digs his shovel into the caked-in dirt above his head. Suddenly the ceiling of dirt comes free burying Joe who struggles to get out. Above, from where the dirt once was, is the smooth surface of concrete. The bottom of the vault.
JOE: Hey! I think I got something. Joe furiously digs his shovel into the caked-in dirt above his head. Suddenly the ceiling of dirt comes free burying Joe who struggles to get out. Above, from where the dirt once was, is the smooth surface of concrete. The bottom of the vault.
MAX: We have arrived! Look at that. Joe gets to his feet - he looks dazed.
HENRY: Not a cloud in the sky.
MAX: So clear you can see tomorrow.
HENRY: You too, Max. Let's go.
DAREK: In this `American dream' of ours, everyone is happy and smiling, they have achieved their objectives.and yet in life there is only change, upheaval, the birth of the new.and that birth is avoiding Henry's gaze.
ON JULIE: avoiding Henry's gaze.
GAYEV: ( THRILLED )
SIMON: Ten minutes people!
JULIE: Come in. Henry appears. She's surprised.
HENRY: I want you to meet me in California.
JULIE: Henry, we've been over this
HENRY: We're doing it tonight. She sits there.
JULIE: It's the only time we can get in the
HENRY: It's the only time we can get in the
VAULT: Of course! Opening night. What else? Like I said, everything always fucks up
JULIE: Of course! Opening night. What else? Like I said, everything always fucks up
HENRY: Nothing's fucked up. If it's tonight or a month from now, what's the difference? I still want you to meet me.
JULIE: Nothing's fucked up? Have you looked around recently? You're leaving. What about the goddamn play?
HENRY: Arnold's coming back. Max arranged it I'm sure he did. He approaches her.
JULIE: I'm sure he did. He approaches her.
HENRY: I want us to be together. She laughs. That's so ridiculous to her.
JULIE: We screwed a couple of times, Henry! So You know that's not true
HENRY: You know that's not true
JULIE: No, really. A couple of times.
MAX: Enjoy the show, folks! He checks his watch.it's two minutes to eight. He walks briskly up the aisle.
SIMON: On a headset. Points to Henry.
SIMON: ON HENRY, watching the curtain start to rise.
THE NURSERY: a long white post-modern room. Sounds of wind. It's may but frosty.
LOPHAKIN: Well, thank god the train is in. What time is it?
DUNYASHA: ( checks his watch ) Almost two. ( blowing out the candle ) It's light already. Henry yawns and stretches.
LOPHAKIN: The train's late. At least two hours.
BERNIE: How you doin', Frank? He un-holsters his weapon, covers as Stan opens the back of the truck. Through the glass, Frank smiles.
FRANK: Doin' good, Bernie. Real good. He sucks his teeth.
MADAME RANEVSKY: My nursery, my dear, beautiful, sweet nursery! This is where I used to sleep when I was a little girl! Henry as Lophakin turns to face her, waiting for her to say hello.instead she breezes past him.
GAYEV: Your train was two hours late. How do you explain that? Is that good management?
"YOU": He unzips a fanny pack, pulls out a WIRE CUTTER, but his hands are trembling and he drops it. Thirty feet to the ground.
CRACK!: INT. STAGE - SAME TIME Standing next to Simon, Henry watches Julie perform from the side of the stage.
MAX: INT. STAGE - SAME TIME Standing next to Simon, Henry watches Julie perform from the side of the stage.
MADAME RANEVSKY: Oh, my childhood, my innocent childhood! I used to sleep in this nursery.
HENRY: Isn't she beautiful?
SIMON: She looks out toward the window through which there is now a projection of the ORCHARD, this time in autumnal
MADAME RANEVSKY: Oh, my cherry orchard.
ON FRANK: Waiting.as he and Bernie watch Stan load the money into the vault.
BERNIE: You ever think what you could do with all that money, Frank?
STAN: I know what you'd do. Buy the Bills and put them in first place.
BERNIE: You'd need a lot more money than that. But I guarantee you I'd have them back in the Super Bowl within two seasons.
STAN: Perfect. Another chance to lose. Frank laughs nervously.
MAX: Oh god, oh god. Where are you, you little He finally finds the right one and CUTS IT :
BERNIE: We're good. Bernie closes the vault.
MADAME RANEVSKY: I'm sure it wasn't in the least funny. I believe people like you should examine their own lives instead of going to the theatre to observe other peoples!
LOPHAKIN: True enough. To be honest. We live a stupid life.
STAN: Well this is it, Frank.
BERNIE: We got you something.
STAN: A little retirement gift. Bernie produces a neatly wrapped gift.
FRANK: Thanks guys.
BERNIE: We wanted to get you something from You like French Roast, right?
STAN: You like French Roast, right?

MAX: Good-bye, Julie.
EDDIE: Go! Go! Go!
MAX: Go! Go! Go!
EDDIE: About time, old man.
MAX: Do your job. Joe leans over and pukes on the ground.
EDDIE: Jesus! Not again! What is it with you?
JOE: Eddie looks at him.
EDDIE: You're a pussy, Joe, you know that? Eddie grabs the drill. Starts to make a hole. Joe starts to prepare the charges.
MADAME RANEVSKY: Well, what should we do? Tell us what to do?
LOPHAKIN: I tell you every day. Every day I say the same thing over and over. You must rent out the Cherry Orchard and the rest of the Estate for villas. At once, right this second, the auction is coming up very soon A muffled BOOM ( o.s. ) Henry freezes. Julie looks at him.
MADAME RANEVSKY: It's all so vulgar! Another muffled BOOM ( o.s. ) this time the audience looks around. Julie glares at him.
MAX: That was good, kid. Good acting.
JOE: ( a little giddy ) There she is. Henry reaches up, touches the steel vault bottom, rubs Get out of there! Eddie arrives in his protection suit, holding a thermite burning tool.
EDDIE: Get out of there! Eddie arrives in his protection suit, holding a thermite burning tool.
EDDIE: Welcome to my world, bitches. They all look up at THE HOLE.
JOE: Fuck, yeah.
ON HENRY: INT. VAULT - A FEW MINUTES LATER as his head rises into view through the newly cut hole. He climbs in and touches the saran-wrapped STACK OF CASH, subdivided into bricks. He sits on it. Thinking. It's dead quiet in here. Max pops his head up. Stares at the cash :
MAX: ( SMILING )
LOPHAKIN: MADAME RANEVSKY
MADAME RANEVSKY: Who bought it? I did. Madame Ranevsky is overwhelmed by the news. Varya takes her keys and throws them on the floor. Exits in a rage.
LOPHAKIN: I did. Madame Ranevsky is overwhelmed by the news. Varya takes her keys and throws them on the floor. Exits in a rage.
JOE: Deb's gonna freak.
LOPHAKIN: .and now the Cherry Orchard is mine. God! God in heaven. The Cherry Orchard is mine! Tell me I'm drunk, tell me I'm out of my mind, tell me I'm dreaming!
MAX: That's everything.
EDDIE: Yes, it is. Max freezes, suddenly notices Eddie is standing there with A GUN pointed at him and Joe.
MAX: What's that, Eddie?
EDDIE: It's a gun, Max. Max doesn't seem so surprised.
MAX: Stay right where you are, Joe. Eddie puts the gun to Max's stomach.
EDDIE: Don't be stupid, Max.
MAX: You're not going to do this, Eddie. Eddie smiles.
EDDIE: I'm not playing with you, old man.
JOE: What are you doing, Eddie? The door swings open HENRY walks in on the scene.
EDDIE: Welcome to the party, Brando. Seeing the gun, Henry freezes at the door. Eddie's in the middle, Max and Joe by the mouth of the tunnel, Max on the floor, a gash on his forehead from Eddie's blow.
HENRY: What are you doing, Eddie? Eddie turns at him.
EDDIE: It's money, Henry. Money.
MAX: This was your chance you idiot. You could've been a better man but you did it again. You messed up. And now you're back with the maggots. Just one big missed Eddie kicks him again.
JOE: Yeah. Come on, Eddie. We're here. We're done. He's right. Come on, man.
EDDIE: Shut up, Joe. Get the money. Put it in the car. Shut up. He turns back to Henry.
MAX: Famach deh mohl! Gey lig mitt'n vahntzin son of a bitch! Henry, a little dazed, picks up the gun.
JOE: ( TO HENRY )
EDDIE: You couldn't have done this without me.
MAX: Our new partner. Huh. Max stuffs a glove into Eddie's mouth but Eddie still kicks like crazy. Max notices Henry's thigh.
HENRY: I got shot. Henry hears the tannoy. It's his cue. He's late.
GAYEV: Thank you, my friends, thank you. Lophakin rushes on stage. He's late. Yasha, holding a tray with small tumblers of champagne, shoots him a look. Madame Ranevsky enters from the other side, hands out cash to the line of hooded figures.
YASHA: The peasants have come to say good-bye.
GAYEV: ( to Madame Ranevsky ) You gave them everything in your purse, Lyuba. Wrong, quite wrong!
MADAME RANEVSKY: I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it. Gayev and Madame Ranevsky walk past Lophakin, ignoring him on their way out.
LOPHAKIN: ( still a little out of
BREATH ): Won't you please come here and drink a glass as a good-bye?
MAX: Old man, huh. Eddie tries to scream but he can't. As Max shuts the door all light is blotted out.
MADAME RANEVSKY: We're going and not a soul will be here until after we're gone.
LOPHAKIN: Until spring. She notices he's clutching his thigh.
JOE: Where is he?
MAX: Any minute now.
ANYA: Goodbye, home! Goodbye to the old life!
TROFIMOV: Hello to the new life! Trofimov exits with Anya. Varya looks around the room and exits. Yasha and Carlotta exit with the dog. Lophakin to Madame Ranevsky and Gayev :
LOPHAKIN: Until the spring, then. Goodbye my friends, until we meet again!
ON HENRY: As he and Julie exchange a final look. She watches him go.it's as if he's moving in slow motion.
GAYEV: My sister! My sister!
MADAME RANEVSKY: Oh, my dear, sweet, lovely orchard! My life, my youth, my happiness, farewell! ANYA ( O.S. ) TROFIMOV ( O.S. ) EXT. THEATRE - MOMENTS LATER Henry comes out the back door. Gets in the car.

HENRY: It's fine. Go. Joe guns it.
ON HENRY: Sitting in the back.
JULIE: ( as Madame Ranevsky ) One last look at these walls, these windows.Dear mother used to love to walk about in this room.
GAYEV: My sister! My sister!
JULIE: ( as Madame Ranevsky ) We're coming. The sound of the HOODED FIGURES as they chop the trees behind her. It's horrific. Madame Ranevsky holds her hands over her ears and falls to the ground.and begins to weep.
HENRY: Stop the car!
MAX: Joe, stop the car.
HENRY: Joe, stop the car.
MAX: He can't stop the car, it's the getaway!
JOE: Yeah, you can't
HENRY: STOP THE FUCKING CAR! Joe screeches to a halt. Henry gets out of the car.
MAX: What the hell are you doing? Henry starts to run back toward the theatre as best he Max sticks his head out the window.
LOPHAKIN: I had to come back. I couldn't get on the train. The moment I stepped on the platform, the blood drained from my ON JULIE, in shock.
ON DAREK: What is he doing? Why is Lophakin back?!
DAREK: What is he doing? Why is Lophakin back?!
ON HENRY: I had to come back.
LOPHAKIN: I had to come back.
MADAME RANEVSKY: ( A WHISPER )
LOPHAKIN: This is the only way you'll listen to me. She looks out to the audience. EAGER FACES awaiting Madame Ranevsky's response.
MADAME RANEVSKY: You should have gotten on that stupid train. You made a mistake.
LOPHAKIN: The mistake would have been getting on that train without telling you how I feel.
MADAME RANEVSKY: Ha! Don't pretend you care about me. All you care about is money.
LOPHAKIN: You think this is about money?
MADAME RANEVSKY: He grabs her.
HENRY: It's never been about money. You know Let go of me!
MADAME RANEVSKY: Let go of me!
LOPHAKIN: MADAME RANEVSKY
MADAME RANEVSKY: Damn it! Just leave, Henry! ( under her breath ) Get off the fucking stage
HENRY: Take a chance. Meet me in Moscow.
MADAME RANEVSKY: No, I'm perfectly happy here.
HENRY: That's not true. Meet me in Moscow. She tries to get away again.
MADAME RANEVSKY: Let me go!
HENRY: I can't. Why are you doing this?
MADAME RANEVSKY: Why are you doing this?
LOPHAKIN: You're just afraid.
MADAME RANEVSKY: I'm not afraid of anything She kicks out at him.
LOPHAKIN: You're afraid because I love you. That hits her. Pause. She breaks away from him, stepping On the side of the stage.
SHOCKED ACTORS: On the side of the stage.
ON JULIE: MADAME RANEVSKY
MADAME RANEVSKY: She searches his expression now.
HENRY: Meet me in Moscow. She can't move. The audience is rapt.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Go with him!
DAREK: at the back of the theatre. Stunned :
DAREK: ( TO SIMON )
JULIE: Henry. You're bleeding.
HENRY: I know.
DAREK: ( whisper to Simon ) Lights down ten. Down ten more. Slowly. Julie and Henry in silhouette now.
JULIE: Oh, fuck, Henry. The lights fade, as an image of WHITE CHERRY BLOSSOMS appears on the projection screen.
FRANK: Hello miou-miou. He looks out at the lush valley below. Smiles.
DAWN: A state of the art hospital room. No expense has been spared. A shaky image of DEB's face as JOE frames the video camera. THE BABY comes into view now. It's beautiful. And screaming its little lungs out.
DEBBIE: A girl.
GROOMING": INT. MAX'S BARBER SHOP - CONTINUOUS The Mailman hands a few letters to the pretty front desk GIRL. Max, his back to us, finishes a shave, talking his customer's ear off.
MAX: Time is a medium of exchange. You can buy things with it. Education. Self-respect. You can even figure out your dream. The Guy nods. Max turns. We see him now. He's super tan. He pulls the sheet off his client.
JULIE: Look. You can see the ocean. He puts his arm around her.
HENRY: `Your brother says I'm an upstart, a money grubber.but I don't care a bit.' She laughs.they kiss in the sun for a while.
EDDIE: I told you before. Dopey. Sleepy. Happy and Doc WHAACK! The slap knocks Eddie to the ground. He's under the table now, his face crushed by the Detective's BOOT :
EDDIE: I may be all those things but one thing I'm not.is a rat. Eddie smiles. His face squashed sideways like that, it's a pretty strange kind of smile.
