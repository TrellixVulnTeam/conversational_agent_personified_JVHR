VIKING: Hoist the torches! Massive flaming braziers are raised on poles, lighting up the night sky. and revealing swirling dragons of all types. Below, Hiccup crosses an open plaza and ducks into an open building with a tall chimney.
GOBBER: Ah! Nice of you to join the party. I thought you'd been carried off. Hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put away Gobber's scattered appendages.
HICCUP: Who me? Nah, come on! I'm way too muscular for their taste. They wouldn't know what to do with all Hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose.
GOBBER: They need toothpicks, don't they? Hiccup gets to work, transferring bent and chipped weapons to the forge as Vikings crowd the counter for replacements.

GOBBER: Oh, you've made plenty of marks. All in the wrong places.
HICCUP: Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon. My life will get infinitely better. I might even get a date.
GOBBER: You can't lift a hammer. You can't swing an axe. Gobber grabs a bola ( iron balls connected by rope ). "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 6.
HICCUP: ( ready with the answer ) Okay fine, but. He rushes to the back corner of the stall and presents a bizarre, wheel barrow-like contraption.
VIKING: See, now this right here is what I'm talking about.
GOBBER: See, now this right here is what I'm talking about.
HICCUP: Mild calibration issue.
GOBBER: Hiccup. If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons, you need to stop all. Gobber gestures in Hiccup's general direction.

CATAPULT OPERATOR: Boulders are catapulted at the corralling Nadders. Just as a huge red dragon whips past, spraying the base of the catapult with sticky fire.
STOICK: Reload! I'll take care of this. Stoick takes on the Nightmare, face to hammer. Suddenly, a LOUD BALLISTIC MOANING streaks overhead. The catapult crew ducks.
VIKING: Night Fury! Get down! Vikings everywhere take shelter. The moaning sound BUILDS.
STOICK: KABOOM! The Catapult EXPLODES as though hit by an artillery shell. sending Stoick and the crew leaping for their lives.

STOICK: STOP! Just..stop. He releases Hiccup. Everyone goes silent, staring STOICK ( CONT'D ) Every time you step outside, disaster follows. Can you not see that I have bigger problems? Winter's almost here and I have an entire village to feed! Hiccup looks around. All eyes are upon him.
HICCUP: Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding, don't ya think? A few rotund Vikings stir self-consciously. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 13.
STOICK: This isn't a joke, Hiccup!
HICCUP: I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just. kill it, you know? It's who I am, Dad.
STOICK: You are many things, Hiccup. But a dragon killer is not one of them. Sting. Hiccup looks around to see many nods of agreement.
TUFFNUT: Quite the performance.
SNOTLOUT: I've never seen anyone mess up that badly. That helped!
HICCUP: Thank you, thank you. I was trying, so. Hiccup avoids Astrid's glare and heads up toward a large house, standing prominently on the hill above the others.
GOBBER: Sure, Hiccup.
HICCUP: He never listens.
GOBBER: Well, it runs in the family. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 14.
HICCUP: And when he does, it's always with this. disappointed scowl. Like someone skimped on the meat in his Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring. I ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on the side. This here. This is a talking fish bone.
GOBBER: You're thinking about this all wrong. It's not so much what you look like. It's what's inside that he can't stand. Thank you, for summing that up. They reach the doorway.
HICCUP: Thank you, for summing that up. They reach the doorway.
GOBBER: Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not. Hiccup SIGHS heavily.
HICCUP: I just want to be one of you guys. Gobber eyes him sympathetically. Hiccup turns and goes through the front door. And straight out the back door. He hurries off into the woods, determined.
STOICK: Either we finish them or they'll finish us! It's the only way we'll be rid of them! If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave.

STOICK: What am I going to do with him Put him in training with the No, I'm serious.
GOBBER: Put him in training with the No, I'm serious.
STOICK: No, I'm serious.
GOBBER: So am I. Stoick turns to him, glaring.
STOICK: He'd be killed before you let the first dragon out of its cage.
GOBBER: Oh, you don't know that.
STOICK: I do know that, actually.

STOICK: My father told me to bang my head against a rock and I did it. I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him. And you know what You got a headache.
GOBBER: You got a headache.
STOICK: That rock split in two. It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber. He could crush mountains, level forests, tame seas! Even as a boy, I knew what I was, what I had to Hiccup is not that boy.
GOBBER: You can't stop him, Stoick. You can only prepare him.
HICCUP: Uggh, the gods hate me. Some people lose their knife or their mug. No, not me. I manage to lose an entire Hiccup WHACKS a low-hanging branch. It SNAPS back at him, hitting him in the face. He looks up to see a snapped tree trunk. His eyes follow it to a long trench of up-turned He follows it to a downed, black dragon, its body and tail tangled in a bola. It appears dead.

STOICK: It's time Hiccup.
HICCUP: Can you not hear me?
STOICK: This is serious son! Stoick forces the axe into Hiccup's hands. Its weight drags him down. He looks up to see Stoick under-lit with firelight.

GOBBER: Welcome to dragon training! The recruits file through the gate, and out onto the arena floor. They take it in like gladiators entering the colosseum. The walls are covered in scorched silhouettes of blasted Vikings. It's a grim yet awe-inspiring place.
ASTRID: No turning back.
TUFFNUT: I hope I get some serious burns.
RUFFNUT: I'm hoping for some mauling, like on my shoulder or lower back.
ASTRID: Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.
TUFFNUT: Oh great. Who let him in? "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 23.
GOBBER: Let's get started! The recruit who does best will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.
SNOTLOUT: Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so does that disqualify him or.? The recruits LAUGH and chatter in the background.
TUFFNUT: Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings? Gobber throws a supportive arm around Hiccup and ushers him ( cheery, in confidence ) Don't worry. You're small and you're weak. That'll make you less of a target. They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more Viking-like teens instead. GOBBER stick him in line with the others and continues on toward five massive reinforced doors. Terrible ROARS and BELLOWS issue from within.

SNOTLOUT: Whoa, wait! Aren't you gonna teach us first!?
GOBBER: I believe in learning on the job. BAM! A GRONCKLE thunders out of its cave, charging into the ring like an irate rhino. The recruits scramble in every direction. Except for Ruffnut and Tuffnut who rush toward it, like pumped-up rodeo clowns.
HICCUP: A doctor?
FISHLEGS: Plus five speed?
ASTRID: A shield.
GOBBER: Shields. Go. The recruits scramble for shields, finding them scattered around the ring. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 25.
TUFFNUT: Get your hands off my shield!
RUFFNUT: There are like a million shields!

RUFFNUT: Ooops, now this one has blood on The Gronckle takes aim at the distracted twins. Blam! The shield is blasted out of both of their hands. Tuff and Ruff SPIN like tops and go down.

TUFFNUT: ( DAZED ) ( CONFUSED )
RUFFNUT: ( CONFUSED )
GOBBER: Those shields are good for another thing. Noise. Make lots of it to throw off a dragon's aim. The kids scoop up weapons and begin hammering on their shields. The Gronckle shakes its head at the clatter. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 26. GRONCKLE'S POV - the teens targets become blurry and scrambled. It's working.

SNOTLOUT: So anyway I'm moving into my parents' basement. You should come by sometime to work out. You look like you work out She cartwheels out of the way, allowing a shot to shoot past her and hit Snotlout's shield. He's blasted onto his back.
GOBBER: Snotlout! You're done! Astrid ROLLS to a stop beside Hiccup, who stirs awkwardly, trying to look cool.
HICCUP: ( VOICE BREAKING )
ASTRID: No. Just you. Astrid ROLLS away. A split-second later a lava slug knocks Hiccup's shield clear off of his arm. Hiccup is exposed.
GOBBER: One shot left! Hiccup panics and chases after his shield as it rolls across the ring. The sudden movement sends the Gronckle chasing after him, leaving Astrid in the clear.
HICCUP ): always go for the kill. He hoists Hiccup to his feet and walks off. Hiccup looks overhead to see a steaming pit in the solid stone wall.
HICCUP: ( MUTTERED )
ASTRID: I mistimed my summersault dive. It was sloppy. It threw off my reverse tumble. Eye rolls from the group.
RUFFNUT: ( SARCASTIC )
SNOTLOUT: ( grabbing Astrid's hand ) No, no, you were great. That was so 'Astrid'.
GOBBER: She's right, you have to be tough on yourselves. CREAK. All eyes turn to Hiccup, entering the hall, sheepishly. Gobber glares at him.
RUFFNUT: He showed up.
TUFFNUT: He didn't get eaten. . but the recruits keep closing the gaps. Rolling his eyes, Hiccup sits at the vacant table next to them.
ASTRID: He's never where he should be. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 30.
GOBBER: Thank you, Astrid. Gobber stands.
TUFFNUT: ( you've got to be kidding ) Wait, you mean read?
RUFFNUT: While we're still alive?
SNOTLOUT: Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about?
FISHLEGS: Oh! I've read it like, seven times. There's this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face. And there's this other one that buries itself for like a week. The teens stare as Fishlegs goes on too long.
TUFFNUT: Yeah, that sounds great. There was a chance I was going to read .but now. Snotlout gets up to go. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 31.

STOICK: I can almost smell them. They're close. Steady. Stoick raises his gaze to. AN EPIC FOG BANK, towering from sky to sea like a bruised, daunting curtain, beyond which nothing is visible. The three ships drift alongside it, skirting its solid edge, looking for an opening. ON DECK the crewmen mill nervously, all too aware of what Stoick is considering.
VIKING: Hard to port. for Helheim's gate. The first ship disappears into the whiteout, followed by the other two.
A BEAT: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 34. Suddenly a flash of light. A silhouette of a dragon. Hollers. Sounds of splitting and shattering wood. Plunges into the water. Another bright flash.
HICCUP: You know, I just happened to notice the book had nothing on Night Furies. Is there another book? Or a sequel? Maybe a little Night Fury KABLAM! A blast takes the axe head off of Hiccup's hilt, leaving a smoking hole behind him. Hiccup YELPS and RUNS.
FISHLEGS: I'm really beginning to question your teaching methods.
GOBBER: Look for its blind spot. Every dragon has one. Find it, hide in it, and strike. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 35. Ruff and Tuff rush in, diving and rolling up to the Nadder's nose. The Nadder sniffs the air it can't see them. Tuff and Ruff are smashed together - too close for comfort.
RUFFNUT: ( WHISPERED )
TUFFNUT: If you don't like it, then just get your own blind spot.
RUFFNUT: How about I give you one! Ruff and Tuff SHOVE each other, till their movement and noise gives them away. The Nadder ATTACKS, SNAPPING at both of Blind spot? Yes. Deaf spot? Not so Hiccup wanders up to Gobber, while the others dart past.
GOBBER: Blind spot? Yes. Deaf spot? Not so Hiccup wanders up to Gobber, while the others dart past.
HICCUP: Hey, so how would one sneak up on a Night Fury?
GOBBER: None one's ever met one and lived to tell the tale. Now get in there.
HICCUP: I know, I know, but She puts her finger to her lips and gestures for him to hide. A moment later, the Nadder leaps over the walls, surprising them by landing in front of her. Astrid somersaults into its blind spot, confusing it. She rears back to strike just as Snotlout LEAPS IN, protectively SWEEPING Astrid behind him.
ASTRID: ( WHISPERED )
SNOTLOUT: Watch out babe. I'll take care of "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 36.

ASTRID: Hiccup spins around to see the maze walls collapsing like dominos toward him. Astrid comes flying through the dust and crash-lands on top of him, laying him out in a limb-tangled Oooh! Love on the battlefield!
TUFFNUT: Oooh! Love on the battlefield!
RUFFNUT: She could do better. The Nadder closes in, emerging through the cloud of dust.
HICCUP: ( struggling to untangle ) Just. let me. why don't you. The Nadder spins around and races back toward them like a Astrid untangles herself and tries to pull her axe from Hiccup's shield. which is attached to his limp, gangly arm. She PLANTS her foot on his torso and YANKS the axe free, still burrowed into the shield. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 37. She SPINS and SWINGS the axe and shield, scoring a DIRECT HIT on the oncoming Nadder's NOSE. It yelps and scurries off.
GOBBER: Well done, Astrid. Gobber hobbles off to wrestle the Nadder back into his cave. Hiccup gets to his feet all eyes are upon him. He turns to find Astrid glaring at him, winded.
ASTRID: Is this some kind of a joke to you? Our parents' war is about to become ours. Figure out which side you're She grabs her axe and stomps off. Hiccup watches, stung.
CLOSE ON: A fish. being thrown into the cove. It hits the ground and slides. A moment later, Hiccup peeks through a gap in the rock, looking around cautiously. Nothing. Hiccup squeezes through and enters the cove. A BEAT, then Hiccup hears a SNORT from behind him. Hiccup turns to see the Night Fury, crouched on a rock like a stealthy panther. It descends, approaching him. ready to Hiccup swallows his fear and offers the fish. Doing so reveals the dagger at his waist. The dragon sees it and hisses. Hiccup reaches for it, eliciting a growl. He pauses, carefully lifts it by the handle, and tosses it away. The dragon calms. As it approaches the fish, Hiccup notices that it's missing Huh. Toothless. I could've sworn you had. A set of razor sharp teeth emerge from its gums to grab the fish. Toothless snatches and gnashes it up, swallowing it. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 38.

GOBBER: .and with one twist he took my hand and swallowed it whole. And I saw the look on his face. ( can't deny it ) I was delicious. He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month before another one of them took my leg.
FISHLEGS: Isn't it weird to think that your hand was inside a dragon. Like if your mind was still in control of it you could have killed the dragon from the inside by crushing his heart or something.
SNOTLOUT: I swear I'm so angry right now. I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot. I'll chop off the legs of every dragon I fight, with my face. He postures to Astrid. She rolls her eyes.
GOBBER: ( with a mouthful ) Un-unh. It's the wings and the tails you really want. If it can't fly, it can't get away. A downed dragon is a dead dragon. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 40. ON HICCUP hiding his horrified look form the others. Gobber stands and stretches.

TUFFNUT: It's not a tattoo. It's a Okay, I've been stuck with you since birth, and that was never there before.
RUFFNUT: Okay, I've been stuck with you since birth, and that was never there before.
TUFFNUT: Yes it was. You've just never seen me from the left side until now.
SNOTLOUT: It wasn't there yesterday. Is it a birthmark or a today-mark? Hiccup gets up and walks away from the group. Astrid watches him as he leaves the bonfire.
CLOSE ON: . a creaking leather bellows. The stone forge glows with every pump. Tongs pull intricate iron pieces from the coals. They're dropped onto the anvil, twisted, lightly hammered, and dunked in a barrel. The pieces are carried to Hiccup's workbench and laid out in place on a one-to-one schematic. It's a sketch of a mechanical fin.
HICCUP: Hey Toothless. I brought breakfast. I hope you're hungry. Hiccup drops the basket and kicks it over. Fish spill out.
AAAAAGGGGHHHHH!: He bounces across the water's surface and takes a dive. Without Hiccup to operate the tail, Toothless does the same, plunging in a massive cannonball. Hiccup resurfaces, roughed up, but beaming. Toothless appears seconds later.
FISHLEGS: ( muttering to himself ) Razor sharp, serrated teeth that inject venom for pre-digestion. Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims in its.
HICCUP: ( TENSE )
SNOTLOUT: If that dragon shows either of his faces, I'm gonna ( spotting an approaching shape, terrified ) Snotlout and Tuffnut HURL their water into the fog.
ASTRID: It's us, idiots. Astrid and Ruffnut are soaked.
RUFFNUT: It's us, idiots. Astrid and Ruffnut are soaked.

TUFFNUT: Oh, I'm hurt. I am very much hurt.
FISHLEGS: Chances of survival are dwindling into single digits now.
HICCUP: Look out! A Zippleback head emerges out of the smoke. Fishlegs hurls his water at it, completely dousing the head. It leers and opens its mouth, spewing gas into the area.
FISHLEGS: Oh. Wrong head. GAS FLOWS around their legs. Fishlegs flees in a panic.
GOBBER: Beat. A clicking sound comes from behind them. Sparks flash in the smoke.
HICCUP: Oh, come on!
GOBBER: RUN, HICCUP! Gobber COVERS his eyes.

HICCUP: BACK! BACK! BACK! Now don't you make me tell you again! The Zippleback retreats through its door and into its cave, HICCUP ( CONT'D ) Yes, that's right. Back into your Hiccup slyly OPENS his vest, revealing the spotted smoked EEL from earlier. He TOSSES it inside the door, then SLAMS it HICCUP ( CONT'D ) Now think about what you've done.

RUFFNUT: It was really cool. He squirms and invents an excuse. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 48.
HICCUP: I left my axe back in the ring. He turns and hurries back.

TUFFNUT: Hiccup, you're totally going to come in first, there's no question.
GOBBER: Meet the Terrible Terror. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 49. A tiny, pint-sized dragon steps out and moves toward the Ha. It's like the size of my Tuffnut is taken down in a blur.
TUFFNUT: Ha. It's like the size of my Tuffnut is taken down in a blur.
HICCUP: Oh, great.
VIKING: Hiccup nods, trying to look casual. Once the coast is clear, he covertly steers Toothless into the Blacksmith's stall. Toothless PRESSES himself inside, rooting through stuff and making a racket. Astrid, walking nearby, is alerted.
HICCUP: Astrid. Hey! Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid.
ASTRID: I normally don't care what people do, but you're acting weird. Well, Toothless spots a nearby sheep and makes a move toward it. As a result, Hiccup is suddenly PULLED TIGHT against the window shutters. He STRIKES A POSE to compensate. then gets PULLED THROUGH the shutters. They snap back in Astrid's face. Astrid reopens them and finds nothing but an empty stall. In the distance, Toothless and Hiccup slip off unseen.
VIKING: Where are the other ships?
SPITELOUT: You don't want to know. Stoick lumbers past Gobber, leaving him staring at the trashed ship.
GOBBER: Well, I trust you found the nest at Not even close.
STOICK: Not even close.
GOBBER: Ah. Excellent. Gobber follows Stoick up the ramp and snags his duffle bag with his hook appendage, sharing the burden.
STOICK: I hope you had a little more success than me.
GOBBER: Well, if by success, you mean that your parenting troubles are over with, then. yes. Stoick stops. What does that mean? A group of merry villagers rush past.
VIKING #1: Congratulations Stoick! Everyone is so relieved.
VIKING #2: Out with the old and in with the new, right?!
VIKING #3: No one will miss that old nuisance!
VIKING #4: The village is throwing a party to Stoick is stunned, overwhelmed by the insensitivity. He turns to Gobber. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 52.
STOICK: He's. gone?
GOBBER: Yeah.most afternoons. But who can blame him? I mean the life of a celebrity is very rough. He can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new Stoick is doubly confused.
STOICK: ( BEAMING )
GOBBER: ( BEAMING )
HICCUP: Okay there bud, we're gonna take this nice and slow. Hiccup checks a leather cheat sheet, clipped onto his harness. Inscribed upon it are several tail positions and their pedal position equivalents.
SHEET ): Position four, no three. They pierce the clouds. For the first time, Hiccup can see the whole of the island below them. It shrinks with every passing second. He SWALLOWS hard and tightens his grip on the HICCUP ( CONT'D ) Yeah! Go baby! Yes! Oh, this is amazing! The wind in my. He spots the leather guide tearing free in the turbulence.
YEEAHHH!: Toothless concurs with a happy SQUEAL and a fireball. Hiccup's glee turn to dread as they fly directly into it.
HICCUP: Uh..no thanks. ( gesturing to his fish on
HICCUP: Dad! You're back! He skirts the bench, blocking Stoick's view of Toothless, the prosthetic fin, and other drawings.
STOICK: I know. I came looking for you.
HICCUP: ( CAUGHT )
STOICK: ( STERN )
HICCUP: Just how long did you think you could hide it from me?

STOICK: What?! I was hoping for this!
HICCUP: Uh.you were?
STOICK: And believe me, it only gets better! Just wait til you spill a Nadder's guts for the first time. Hiccup's elated expression sinks.
HICCUP: ( SINCERE )
STOICK: Your mother would've wanted you to have it.
HICCUP: I should really get to bed. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 59.

STOICK: Well..uh..good night. Stoick leaves the room awkwardly, leaving Hiccup looking more burdened than ever.
ASTRID: Stay out of my way! I'm winning this thing.
HICCUP: Please, by all means. She darts off, CLOSING FAST on the dragon. The crowd above cheers her on.
ASTRID: This time. This time for sure. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 60. With a FIERCE BATTLE-CRY she LEAPS from cover, axe cocked to ASTRID ( CONT'D ) And as she clears the barriers, she sees that Hiccup has already laid the Gronckle out.
MUNGE BUCKET!: A loud CLACK ring out. From the crowd above, Gothi, the village elder, steps forward, tapping her staff. Everyone lights up excitedly.
STOICK: Wait! Wait!
HICCUP: So, later. Gobber snags Hiccup as he attempts to leave.
GOBBER: Not so fast.
HICCUP: I'm kinda late for
ASTRID: ( LIVID )
STOICK: Okay quiet down. The elder has Thrilled, Gobber stands behind Hiccup and Astrid. He points to Astrid as the crowd waits in silent anticipation. Gothi shakes her head 'no.' The crowd 'Oooohs.' Gobber then points to Hiccup. The elder nods an affirmative 'yes.' The crowd erupts in cheers. Astrid turns a seething, deadly glare on Hiccup. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 61.
GOBBER: You've done it! You've done it, Hiccup! You get to kill the dragon!
STOICK: Ha, ha! That's my boy! Hiccup is hoisted onto the recruits' shoulders and carried out to the cheering spectators.
HICCUP: ( MASKING PANIC )
HICCUP: . leaving. We're leaving. Let's pack up. Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation, forever. Toothless is nowhere in sight. Hiccup sets down his basket and opens it up, his head clouded with troubles.
ASTRID: I want to know what's going on. No one just gets as good as you do. Especially you. Start talking! Are you training with someone?
HICCUP: She grabs him by his odd-looking harness. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 62.
ASTRID: It better not involve. this.
HICCUP: I know this looks really bad, but you see.this is, uh. They hear a RUSTLE coming from the other side of the cove.

Drag me back. Go ahead. Here we go. He puts her hand back on his harness, getting her to 'drag him back.' Astrid BENDS Hiccups hand backwards, driving him HICCUP ( CONT'D ) AAAAUUGGGHHH! Why would you do That's for the lies. Astrid pounces the hilt of her axe off of Hiccup's laid-out ASTRID ( CONT'D ) And THAT'S for everything else. Hiccup's YELP is answered with A GROWL, coming from the other side of the cove. Astrid looks up to see. A NIGHT FURY. Toothless pounces toward them, snarling.
ASTRID: That's for the lies. Astrid pounces the hilt of her axe off of Hiccup's laid-out ASTRID ( CONT'D ) And THAT'S for everything else. Hiccup's YELP is answered with A GROWL, coming from the other side of the cove. Astrid looks up to see. A NIGHT FURY. Toothless pounces toward them, snarling.
HICCUP: ( FEEBLE )
ASTRID: Get down! Run! Run! Astrid pulls her axe, ready to take on Toothless.
HICCUP: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 63. Hiccup knocks Astrid's cocked axe to the ground, out of reach, then stops Toothless short of crushing her.
ASTRID: I scared him!? Hiccup makes a âbe quietâ motion.
HICCUP: We're dead. Satisfied with Astrid's departure, Toothless turns away.
ASTRID: Oh great Odin's ghost, this is it! "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 64. Hiccup and Toothless fly Astrid to the top of a towering pine. It bows and creaks under their weight as Astrid dangles a hundred feet in the air.
HICCUP: You have to give me a chance to I'm not listening to ANYTHING you have to say!
ASTRID: I'm not listening to ANYTHING you have to say!
HICCUP: Then I won't speak. Just let me show you. Hiccup extends a hand.
ASTRID: Now get me down.
HICCUP: Toothless? Down. Gently. Toothless leers mischievously. He spreads his wings slowly. With a WHOP, they fill with the updraft. Toothless releases the tree, tucks in his legs, and HOVERS in place.
ASTRID: Okay! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Just get me off of this thing. Astrid is defeated, her aggressive energy gone. Satisfied, Toothless relents. They level off and head up into the clouds. Astrid opens her eyes again, and looks out over a world she'd never dreamed of. She reaches out and touches clouds, pierces columns ablaze in golden hues, and floats over a vast, alien sky- scape. Her terror is replaced by wonder. She grins, despite Toothless rises above a blanket of clouds.
ASTRID: Alright I admit it. This is pretty cool. It's. amazing.
HICCUP: Don't remind me. A strange, unearthly din approaches. Toothless' ear plates suddenly stand on end. Panicked, he abruptly dives, dipping into cloud cover.
ASTRID: What's going on?
HICCUP: I don't know.
ASTRID: What does that make us? The dragons BANK and dive in formation, plummeting through the thickening fog and weaving between towering, craggy sea They emerge at the base of a massive volcanic caldera, glowing with rivulets of lava. The flock of dragons fall into rank, funneling through a crack, and zipping through a winding tunnel. It gives way to a vast, steamy inner chamber, tiered with pocky shelves. Dragons of all breeds lay about, nested in The arriving dragons fly in, dropping the fish and game into a central pit, glowing red and shrouded in mist. Hiccup is amazed.
HICCUP: What my dad wouldn't give to find Toothless peels away from the procession, landing on a small shadowy shelf to keep a low-profile. Hiccup and Astrid peek around, taking in the busy hive of sorts. They watch as the food continues to be dropped into the pit.
ASTRID: They're not eating any of it. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 68. Last to arrive is a dim-witted Gronckle. It hovers over the pit and regurgitates his paltry contribution a pathetic little fish. As it falls into the steamy pit, a terrible ROAR rings out. The Gronckle tries to flee, but before it can, a gargantuan dragon head juts from the steamy pit and SNAPS it out of the air. Swallowing it back whole. Hiccup and Astrid recoil, terrified.
HICCUP: Alright buddy, we gotta get out of here. Now! Toothless takes flight, barely evading the monster's snapping The behemoth dragon lunges for them, snatching a Zippleback out of the air instead. Toothless disappears into the winged exodus as thousands of dragons flee the caldera in fear.
ASTRID: ( her mind reeling, talking Hiccup's ear off ) No, no, it totally makes sense. It's like a giant beehive. They're the workers. and that's their queen. It controls them. She leaps off of Toothless and runs toward the village.
HICCUP: No, no! Not yet. They'll. kill "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 69.
ASTRID: Hiccup, we just discovered the dragons' nest.the thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here. And you want to keep it a secret? To protect your pet dragon? Are you serious? Hiccup stands firm, resolute.
HICCUP: Astrid's taken aback.
ASTRID: ( BEAT )
HICCUP: Just give me until tomorrow. I'll figure something out.
ASTRID: Astrid PUNCHES Hiccup in the arm.
HICCUP: What are you looking at? "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 70.
STOICK: ( aloud to the crowd ) Well, I can show my face in public LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE STOICK ( CONT'D ) If someone had told me that in a few short weeks, Hiccup would go from being, well. Hiccup, to placing first in dragon training. I would've tied him to a mast and shipped him off for fear he'd gone mad. Yes! And you know it!
ASTRID: Be careful with that dragon.
HICCUP: ( re: the roaring crowd ) It's not the dragon I'm worried What are you going to do?
ASTRID: ( WORRIED )
HICCUP: Put an end to this. She eyes him, dubious. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 71.
ASTRID: ( GRIM )
GOBBER: It's time, Hiccup. Knock him dead. Hiccup puts his helmet on and enters the ring.
TUFFNUT: Show 'em how it's done, my man! Hiccup locks eyes with Stoick. Stoick nods with a smile. Hiccup returns a half-smile. Takes a deep breath. He hoists a shield onto his forearm and selects his weapon from a rack of many a small dagger.
STOICK: ( MUTTERED )
HICCUP: I'm ready. The door bolt is raised. The crowd grows quiet. BOOM! The doors blast open with a stream of sticky fire. Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, coated in flames. It tears out of its cave like an irate bull as the crowd roars and It climbs the walls and chain enclosure like a bat, hissing at the provoking crowd and blasting fire. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 72. It spots Hiccup and descends, leering and licking the flaming drool from its lips. The crowd grows silent, bracing for the big fight. With the Monstrous Nightmare's eyes locked upon him, Hiccup deliberately drops his shield and dagger stepping away from them. The dragon pauses, confused. ON STOICK, also confused.
STOICK: What is he doing? The dragon presses closer, snorting. Hiccup extends his open hand. It snarls.
HICCUP: ( WHISPERED )
STOICK: Stop the fight.
HICCUP: No. I need you all to see this. The crowd gets restless.
STOICK: I SAID STOP THE FIGHT! "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 73. Stoick whacks his hammer against the iron enclosure, rattling the arena with a terrible reverberating clatter. Spooked, the Nightmare snaps at Hiccup's outstretched hand. Hiccup YELPS and springs backward. The spell is broken. The Nightmare reacts to Hiccup's sudden movements and blasts another stream of fire. Hiccup SCREAMS and barely dives out of reach.
ON TOOTHLESS: His ear plates shoot up. Panic flares in his eyes.
STOICK: Out of my way!
ASTRID: Astrid wedges her axe under the arena gate and squeezes EXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS Toothless bounds to the cove walls, clawing them in desperation. It seems he's as trapped as before, but with an incredible BURST of effort he HOOKS a claw over the upper lip of the stone wall.
ASTRID: She picks up a hammer and hurls it at the Monstrous Nightmare, hitting it in the head. It turns its attention to Astrid, and begins chasing her. Stoick raises the arena gate, waving her toward it.
STOICK: This way! Astrid makes it through, but the Nightmare BLASTS the doorway, cutting Hiccup off. It pounces on him and prepares to finish him off. Suddenly, a terrible roar pierces the din.
GOBBER: Night Fury! Get down! Toothless bounds over the crowd and BLASTS a hole through the chain enclosure. He flies through it and disappears in the boiling smoke. The Vikings rush to railings. in time to see a flurry of wings cutting through the dissipating smoke. Toothless and the Nightmare tumble into the clear, locked in a toothy, vicious fight. Toothless kicks the Nightmare off and plants himself between Hiccup and it. The Nightmare snarls, circling them. Toothless lunges and ROARS. causing the Nightmare to relent and back away. To everyone's shock and horror, Hiccup gets to his feet and grabs Toothless protectively.
HICCUP: ( PANICKED )
VIKINGS: Night Fury! "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 75. Hiccup tries to shoo Toothless away in vain. Vikings begin pouring clambering through the enclosure and dropping into the ring.
HICCUP: Go! GO!
VIKING: Take it alive! Stoick grabs an axe and charges into the arena. Astrid calls out to him, panicked.
ASTRID: Stoick no!
HICCUP: Dad! No! He won't hurt you! The other Vikings surround and attack Toothless. He tosses them aside like rag dolls, his eyes focused on Stoick.
NO!: Toothless swallows back the blast and turns to Hiccup, not Get him! The crowd rushes him, piling on, and taking Toothless down. Astrid holds Hiccup back.
VIKING: Get him! The crowd rushes him, piling on, and taking Toothless down. Astrid holds Hiccup back.
HICCUP: ( DESPERATE )
STOICK: Put it with the others! His burning glare turn to Hiccup.
ON HICCUP: Being shoved into the dank, dimmed hall. SLAM! The massive doors rattle and echo. Stoick pushes past him. He paces against a backdrop of shadowy tapestries and carved pillars a legacy of heroes, all peering down in angered judgement.
STOICK: I should have known. I should have seen the signs.
HICCUP: We had a deal! Stoick pauses to say something, but stops short. He SNORTS and resumes pacing, repeating the cycle.

HICCUP: ( FLUSTERED )
STOICK: So everything in the ring. A trick? A lie? He stomps toward Hiccup. Stops short and points, fighting back words.
HICCUP: I screwed up. I should have told you before now. Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please. just don't hurt Toothless. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 77.
STOICK: The dragon? That's what you're worried about? Not the people you almost killed?!
HICCUP: He was just protecting me! He's not They've killed HUNDREDS OF US!
STOICK: They've killed HUNDREDS OF US!
HICCUP: And we've killed THOUSANDS OF THEM! They defend themselves, that's all! They raid us because they have to! If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves.
STOICK: Their island? He stomps back. pointing an accusing finger.
HICCUP: Did I say nest? Hiccup goes silent he said too much.
STOICK: How did you find it?!
HICCUP: No. I didn't. Toothless did. Only a dragon can find the island. Stoick GLARES. A moment passes, then an idea takes form on his face. His eyes flare. Hiccup watches, realizing. Stoick stomps toward the doorway.
ME?!: He throws Hiccup off of him, SWATTING him to the floor. Icy stillness. Hiccup stares back, stunned.
STOICK: You've thrown your lot in with them. You're not a Viking.
STOICK: Set sail! We head for Helheim's He then notices HICCUP watching from his familiar cliff-side perch beyond the village. Their eyes meet, full of hurt and regret. Hiccup slowly shakes his head in warning. Stoick breaks the stare and turns to Toothless, fuming.
ON HICCUP: Watching. He's powerless to stop what is happening, but won't EXT. CLIFFS - LATER Still standing there. The ships have cleared the horizon. CRANE UP to reveal Astrid is standing behind him. She approaches cautiously and stands beside him in silence.

ASTRID: It's a mess. Hiccup doesn't respond.
HICCUP: Thank you for summing that up.
ASTRID: Yep. The rest of us would have done So why didn't you? Hiccup just shakes his head - he really doesn't know. Astrid's eyes glimmer. She wants something.
HICCUP: I don't know. I couldn't.
ASTRID: That's not an answer.
HICCUP: ( BECOMING IRATE )
ASTRID: Because I want to remember what you say right now.
HICCUP: ( angry, loud ) Oh for the love of I was a coward! I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.
ASTRID: You said 'wouldn't' that time.
HICCUP: ( BLOWS UP )
ASTRID: First to ride one, though. Hiccup blinks. He never looked at it that way before.
HICCUP: ( REALIZING )
ASTRID: I bet he's really frightened now.
HICCUP: Probably something stupid.
ASTRID: Good. But you've already done that. Another beat.
HICCUP: Then something crazy. Astrid smiles.
ASTRID: That's more like it.
STOICK: Sound your positions. Stay within Shouts pour in from all directions.

VIKING #6: Haven't a clue. ON STOICK straining into the fog as the calls continue. Massive, jagged sea stacks begin to emerge, threatening to rip the ships to shreds. Gobber approaches him, speaking under his breath.
GOBBER: Listen. Stoick. I was overhearing some of the men just now and, well, some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here not me of course, I know you're always the man with the plan but some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all, what it might be?
STOICK: Find the nest and take it.
GOBBER: Ah. Of course. Send them running. The old Viking fall-back. Nice and Stoick notices that Toothless' ear plates are at the alert, quietly reacting to inaudible sounds. Stoick crosses to the stern of the ship and grabs the tiller, moving the helmsman out of the way.

TUFFNUT: You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon.
HICCUP: I love this plan.
SNOTLOUT: I love this plan.
HICCUP: I didn't.
RUFFNUT: You're crazy.
ASTRID: So? What is the plan? Hiccup smiles, glowing in the support of his friends.
GOBBER: Ah. I was wondering where that A clicking buzz becomes audible, growing louder. It fills the sky, converging in one general direction. Stoick sniffs the Stay low and ready your weapons. Stoick's ship suddenly JERKS to a halt as the keel burrows into shallow black sand. Stoick hops overboard, landing on a sprawling beach. The BUZZING suddenly STOPS.

HICCUP: Relax. It's okay. it's okay. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft ( Rev.19 ) 02-13-2010 85. Hiccup replaces his outstretched hand with Snotlout's, putting him in control of the massive beast. The Nightmare snorts, but remains calm. Snotlout, by contrast, chuckles nervously it's at once terrifying and amazing. The others watch, spellbound. Hiccup turns and walks away.
SNOTLOUT: Where are you going?! Hiccup pulls a bundle of rope from a supply box.
HICCUP: You're going to need something to help you hold on. The teens eye each other apprehensively, and look up to ALL THE DRAGONS standing in the ring, facing the teens EXT.

Several more hits tear away at the hollow shell of hardened A final boulder shatters the fractured wall, creating a deep, dark opening to the cavern within. Silence. Stock raises his hand, makes a gesture. A flaming bushel is launched into the dark, lighting the wall. CHOKED
GOBBER: Is that it? Above the island, dragons POUR from every crevice, fleeing to the sky. The sound of screeching dragons fades.
VIKINGS: ( Cheering as one )
SPITELOUT: We've done it! Stoick doesn't celebrate. Something is not right. He HEARS something. Stoick turns to peer down the dark throat of the A deep, rumbling ROAR echoes from the cavern. The ground underfoot TREMBLES. The ships rock. Their sails fill with a blast of air. The cheering stops. Stoick's expression sinks.
STOICK: This isn't over. Form your ranks! Hold together! The men SCRAMBLE to organize themselves.
GOBBER: Beard of Thor.what is that?
STOICK: ( AGHAST )
VIKING #3: Get to the ships!
STOICK: No! NO! The Red Death BLASTS the ships like a mile-long flamethrower. The sails are torched. Vikings dive overboard and masts come Gobber Joins Stoick.
GOBBER: Heh. Smart, that one. Stoick looks up and down the beach for an answer.
STOICK: ( GUILT-RIDDEN )
SPITELOUT: ( turns to the others ) Everybody to the far side of the The Vikings scatter into the rocks like ants. Satisfied with the ships destruction, The Red Death turns its attention back to the Vikings. They seem to have vanished. It SNIFFS the air, searching for their scent. Gobber drops in beside Stoick, like two soldiers in a trench. Fire blasts over head, causing them to duck.
STOICK: Gobber, go with the men.
GOBBER: I think I'll stay, just in case you're thinking of doing something Stoick grabs him.
STOICK: ( EMPHATIC )
GOBBER: Then I can double that time. Stoick grins. Friends to the bitter end. They BREAK COVER and dash into the open, SPLITTING UP. Stoick rips a sharpened post from the ground and hurls it into the monster's face.
STOICK: NO, HERE! It spots both of them. He fuels up to fire, glancing back and forth between the two men. He focuses on Stoick.

It turns distracted, as. . a Nadder punches through the flames, banking across the sky. Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, a Zippleback, and a Gronckle. They roll in unison, revealing the recruits riding on their backs. Hiccup leads, with Astrid clinging to his GOBBER AND STOICK, watch slack-jawed, in awe.
HICCUP: Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs! Move The monster shakes off the blast and snaps in their wake. Hiccup directs his squadron out of harm's way. They climb out of reach and circle each other.
TUFFNUT: Look at us, we're on a dragon! We're on dragons, all of us!
HICCUP: Up, let's move it! The dragons climb past the Red Death.
GOBBER: Every bit the boar-headed, stubborn Viking you ever were. Stoick is speechless.
HICCUP: Fishlegs, break it down.

HICCUP: Okay. Lout, Legs, hang in its blind spot. Make some noise, keep it confused. Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit. Make it mad.
