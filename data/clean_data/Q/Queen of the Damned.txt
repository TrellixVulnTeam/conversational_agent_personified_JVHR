ALEX: What the hell, Maudy.
LESTAT: Please don't stop.
JAMES: What the f How did you get in The door, of course.
LESTAT: The door, of course.
LESTAT: Your music woke me from the longest sleep. It's sublime. In two hundred years I've never heard anything quite like it.
ALEX: Who the hell are you?
LESTAT: You may call me the vampire Lestat.
LESTAT: Your struggles are over.
LESTAT: All that you've ever dreamed of will be yours. What the hell is this?
ALEX: ( terrified ) What the hell is this?
LESTAT: Your lucky day.
JAMES: Cool. We got our very own vampire.
MAUDY: Hey, Vampire Lestat, I've always wondered. about Keith Richards.
FANS: Lestat! Lestat! May I present the Vampire Lestat.
ROGER: May I present the Vampire Lestat.
LESTAT: Good evening. I'm so sorry I'm late. I was just having my.
JOURNALIST: Excellent makeup job. Marilyn Manson, look out. Hey, hey! We're gonna keep this short here! One at a time. You!
ROGER: Hey, hey! We're gonna keep this short here! One at a time. You!
LESTAT: Yes. But why hide it in this day and age? I've hidden in the shadows for centuries. It's time to share myself with the world.
MUSIC JOURNALIST: And it doesn't hurt the record sales, huh? Your album just topped all kinds of sales records.
LESTAT: Our label isn't complaining, no.
LESTAT: If you like, I'll give you a private demonstration in your hotel room tonight.
LIFESTYLE JOURNALIST: Why not a demo at your own house? I mean, what's with all the secrecy about where you stay? Is it true you move residences every few days?
LESTAT: ( smiles, giving away After calling one stone tomb home sweet home for so long, I like to experience as much diversity as I can. Wouldn't you?
MUSIC JOURNALIST: There are a lot of rumors flying around the internet about the hidden meaning in your lyrics, that you're giving away 'vampire secrets.' Something in all that?
MUSIC JOURNALIST: Of the closet.
LESTAT: ( smiles ) The casket.
MUSIC JOURNALIST: Your first and only concert's in Death Valley, just days away. Why just the one?
LESTAT: ( grins ) I don't like repeating myself.
MUSIC JOURNALIST: But these other vampires, aren't they going to be pissed that you're giving away their secrets?
LESTAT: I imagine they are, yes.
LIFESTYLE JOURNALIST: Do you have anything to say to the other vampires listening out Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
LESTAT: Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
VAMPIRE #1: Goddamn fool's going to bring back the Inquisition.
VAMPIRE #2: I say we kill him, before this gets out of hand. Bleed him dry.
VAMPIRE #1: Gotta find him first. Elusive bloke. Never know where he's going to turn up.
VAMPIRE #2: Well we know one place he's definitely going to be.
VAMPIRE #1: When I was in Manchester, the coven there was saying exactly the same thing. That we should nail him at the concert.
VAMPIRE #1: Yes. Well let's see how he handles a thousand of us at once.
LESTAT: See you all in Death Valley.
LESTAT: ( quietly, to world ) Come out, come out, whoever you
VAMPIRE: Ah, Jesse. You want to come and play with us, don't you?
VAMPIRE: Soon, soon, little one. I'll make sure you're with us forever.
JESSE: Jesse sits up with a start. She stands, heart pounding, trying to shake the dream off. We see on a bulletin board behind her, a flyer for Lestat's concert. She takes off the headphones. Walking over to the mantel above her fireplace, she picks up a solitary, framed photo holds it tight.
JESSE: I have reason to believe Lestat's the real thing. A vampire. And an ancient one.
TALAMASCAN #1: I don't know, Jesse. It looks to me like the guy's got a good P.R. man with a flair for the It would appear that way. But have you listened to his songs? Read his lyrics? Well,i have. In one of his songs he refers to a pub called the Sailor's Arms. I think it's a

JESSE: ( reading screen ) 'Where are you now? Back in the sailor's arms, somewhere in the back streets of Soho?' I tracked down the old leases in London. It turns out, in the late 1700's, there was a pub right in the backstreets of Soho called the Sailor's Arms.
JESSE: And it had a reputation for dealing with black magic. Witches' covens, seances, that sort of thing.
JESSE: And most importantly, reports of people being lured there and subsequently attacked by bloodsucking fiends.
JESSE: Here's where you could find the Sailor's Arms in old London.
JESSE: And here is where it would be today. Of course the Sailor's Arms is not there anymore. That part of London is mostly old warehouses, meat-packing plants.
TALAMASCAN #2: In a few years it will be artists' lofts and pretentious French
JESSE: Yes, but right now there's only one place to get a drink of sorts. A private club in exactly the same place. The Waverly Arms.
JESSE: Well, what happens at the Waverly Arms now makes the Sailor's Arms look like a Happy Meal at
JESSE: It's a vampire coven. And Lestat's leading us to it. And what makes you think so?
TALAMASCAN #1: ( skeptical ) And what makes you think so?
TALAMASCAN #2: Jesse, can you, uh, focus that any Well. it was taken. while. . in motion. But listen, if you look closely, you can see they're vampires. I'm sure of it. And Lestat's leading us to them and

TALAMASCAN #3: ( interrupting ) Interesting. Perhaps we should assign someone to observe
TALAMASCAN #1: Oh please, based on this so-called 'data'? That's a waste of time.
JESSE: But. uh.
TALAMASCAN #2: ( looking up for a Wait a second. Who took this I did.
JESSE: ( a beat, softly ) I did.
TALAMASCAN #2: You went there?
JESSE: Yes. Last night.
TALAMASCAN #1: And who gave you this directive?
JESSE: No one. I. just. went. Look, I know it was breaking protocol and I'm really sorry, it's just I think
TALAMASCAN #1: Jesse! You're just an apprentice here! You must follow our rules. Or perhaps we need to reconsider your position.
TALAMASCAN #3: For 12 centuries our mission as Talamascans has been to observe and record paranormal behavior. But never get involved. You're getting far too close.
JESSE: ( gesturing to photo, Hey, does it look like I got involved? That is not called involvement. That is called ( leaning forward, But, Jesse, tell us, what did you
TALAMASCAN #2: ( leaning forward, But, Jesse, tell us, what did you
JESSE: Vampires. Gathering. I'm sure of
JESSE: You have to listen to Lestat's lyrics. They're amazing.
TALAMASCAN #1: It doesn't make any sense. Why would he be forecasting this to the world? He's all but drawn a map and marked an X. What vampires hold sacred is keeping their kind a secret. You never name other immortals, tell where their lairs are. They'd be hunted Right. That's the best part. Lestat's not afraid to piss them off. He wants mortals and immortals to know he's there, to know he exists. I don't know But this has never happened before. Don't you see? He's a one man revolution.
JESSE: Right. That's the best part. Lestat's not afraid to piss them off. He wants mortals and immortals to know he's there, to know he exists. I don't know But this has never happened before. Don't you see? He's a one man revolution.
TALAMASCAN #1: And this photo is your evidence? It's hardly conclusive. C'mon. It looks like the Blair
JESSE: Fine. Well then, I guess I'll just have to go back and get better, more conclusive evidence! Maybe you just can't unravel all the mysteries of the world out there, by sitting around all day in a dusty old library in here!
TALBOT: My office. Now.
SLEEK BOUNCER: Okay, you, in. You. No. You in. You, no.
UNATTRACTIVE GUY: C'mon, man, she's waiting for me in there. She said she was putting me on the list. My name's Yeah, yeah, right. Hey, get a life, alright? You, in.
BOUNCER #1: Yeah, yeah, right. Hey, get a life, alright? You, in.
BOUNCER #1: Hey, perv, get the hell out of
LESTAT: You. In.
LESTAT: ( softly ) You. No.
ROGER: Yeah, Phil. We'll need a limo from the airport. I don't know which airfield yet. I don't know the arrival time either.
ROGER: ( softly ) just uh. shy. that's it.
JAMES: We rock.
LESTAT: Yes, I'd say I'm down with that.
JAMES: I'm ready for Los Angeles.
MAUDY: I'm ready for Death Valley. Two days till we go.
ALEX: Think we can call that a night.
LESTAT: Oh, the sweet song of her blood.
LESTAT: I'll hear it in my head all night.
LESTAT: He goes directly to Roger, reaches into his open shirt, pulls out the crucifix around his neck.
LESTAT: I didn't know you were religious.
LESTAT: ( CONTINUED )
LESTAT: Be careful, Roger. Very careful.
TALBOT: How's everything? You alright? You sleeping okay?
JESSE: Yeah, I'm great. I just found a Jesse. you're taking this Lestat stuff pretty seriously. why?
TALBOT: ( considers her ) Jesse. you're taking this Lestat stuff pretty seriously. why?
JESSE: Cause I think I'm on to something pretty big. The most important sighting Talamasca's had in Jesus, I don't know, David. I thought I was onto something. Maybe I didn't see anything.
TALBOT: You know we work in a really strange field? The supernatural is beguiling at times. It doesn't like to just be observed, it is only satisfied when it has drawn us in completely. I know cause I've felt these things myself.
JESSE: ( leaning forward ) Talbot. C'mon. You know me. I'm not freaking out on you. I'm just onto what looks alright looked like a good lead. You're the one who taught me how to do all this. You're the one who taught me to keep pushing and pushing.
JESSE: David. There's nothing else. Nothing is 'beguiling' me, alright? Nothing. C'mon.
TALBOT: Alright. Just checking.
TALBOT: Well, all I can say is you're really lucky you're not lying dead in a gutter with two holes on your neck.
JESSE: I'd be even luckier if that damn picture came out. Wait a second. So you do believe me? You do think it's a vampire Yes. But not exactly for the reasons you think. Though your research is top-notch of course. Come back here. I'm gonna show you something.
TALBOT: ( looks up, eyes Yes. But not exactly for the reasons you think. Though your research is top-notch of course. ( smiles ) Come back here. I'm gonna show you something.
TALBOT: What do you see?
JESSE: They're all nightscapes. The detail is amazing. Mid-1500s. Right. And what do you see in this one?
TALBOT: Right. And what do you see in this one?
TALBOT: And I know it's a Dutch pastoral.
JESSE: This man is in both.
TALBOT: Right. He's in all of them.
JESSE: Have you
TALBOT: Carbon tested? Yes. The different paint samples are all authentic. All painted at the time of that particular style.
TALBOT: It's Marius, Jesse.
JESSE: ( whirling around ) Marius?! From Lestat's lyrics. I knew I was right.
TALBOT: Yes, you were. Good work.
TALBOT: I've been personally tracing him for decades. My little obsession. The oldest vampire ever documented. The closest we've come to the original What do you mean the original
JESSE: What do you mean the original
TALBOT: There's a Mesopotamian legend that there once was a queen of Egypt, Akasha, long before Tutankhamen or Nefertiti. She was believed to be the original vampire. Marius himself dates back to 400 B.C.
JESSE: David, you've been tracking Marius your whole life. Maybe he's out there waiting for you right now. Don't you ever want to just go and find him and
TALBOT: No. Jesus, we are not talking about having a drink at the Dorchester, Jesse. You know that. Especially with the ancient vampires the older they are, the more powerful, the more
TALBOT: Anyway, you don't need to go and stake out some club. Your time is too valuable. I have something far better for you.
JESSE: ( surprised )
TALBOT: Yes. And I'll tell you something. I've never shown this to anyone. No one else has proved themself in the way you have.
JESSE: ( touched ) Thanks. What is it?
TALBOT: Oh you're gonna love this. Although I'm sure it will keep you up nights to come with nightmares. Lestat's diary. I found it some years ago. This is where you'll find the answers you need.
TALBOT: Lestat's diary. I found it some years ago. This is where you'll find the answers you need.
TALBOT: They don't need to know everything, right?
JESSE: Thank you for this.
TALBOT: My pleasure. When I took you on as an apprentice, I knew it was the smartest thing I'd ever done. Now you and I'll meet when you're done. This will be our project.
JESSE: Je suis le vampire Lestat. I am the vampire Lestat.
MARIUS: Lestat. Welcome.
LESTAT: Who are you? Do I know you?
MARIUS: I'm unknowable by nature.
MARIUS: But you may call me Marius.
LESTAT: I'm the lord of a great manor. They'll send an army of men to look for me.
MARIUS: I doubt they'll find you, Lord De Lioncourt. You're a long way from home. You're weak. near passing. I can barely hear your heartbeat.
MARIUS: You're weak. near passing. I can barely hear your heartbeat.
LESTAT: I'll kill you!
MARIUS: You really do fear nothing. It is why I chose you. Because you think things are possible which aren't possible.
LESTAT: Chose me? For what?
MARIUS: My companion. Someone to share my
MARIUS: You've lost a great deal of blood.
LESTAT: ( near tears ) I'm dying.
MARIUS: Then drink. Good, is it not?
MARIUS: Good, is it not?
MARIUS: Drink and live. You've been brave enough for one night, my son.
MARIUS: Drink. drink and learn.
MARIUS: There. there. that will do.
MARIUS: No. no more. Lestat, no more!
MARIUS: Don't be afraid, it's only your body that dies.
LESTAT: Lestat smiles with red glistening lips. A beat on Marius as he slowly smiles, too.
MARIUS: That's enough, my son. When you feed, you must hold back from the moment of death. You must never take the last drop, or it will draw you in and you will die.
MARIUS: Remember, there is wisdom in the flesh, Lestat. A man wears his history on his skin.
MARIUS: I'm talking about humanity.
LESTAT: ( snort ) We're murderers.
MARIUS: We're more than that. Their blood that we take into us carries with it life. their life, their knowledge, their complexity. Appreciate your prey, Lestat.
MARIUS: The trick is to find the way to face eternity head on. The spirit can be annihilated by boredom just as the body can be destroyed by sun or fire. My solace, my delight, is witnessing the unfolding of human destiny.
MARIUS: . From Christ to the Dark Ages to the enlightenment, I've never been able to divine what was coming. That's what keeps me going I can't wait to see what human beings are going to do next. Who could've predicted the Enlightenment? Or Hannibal and his But why must we hide, Marius? We are the powerful, we are the immortal. We should walk fearless in the open!
MARIUS: Who could've predicted the Enlightenment? Or Hannibal and his But why must we hide, Marius? We are the powerful, we are the immortal. We should walk fearless in the open!
MARIUS: ( CONTINUED )
LESTAT: But why must we hide, Marius? We are the powerful, we are the immortal. We should walk fearless in the open!
MARIUS: Shhh. The life of a vampire is a life of discretion. We must sleep during the day, when we are vulnerable to the sun. Mortals must never know about us. It is forbidden, for the sake of all our So I could never know her?
LESTAT: ( gazing at violin So I could never know her?
MARIUS: Not unless you wanted to kill her.
LESTAT: ( beat, quietly, So I can never be known?
MARIUS: You're known by me. I granted you that. There are others of our kind. though most are solitary
LESTAT: My God.
MARIUS: Forget God. You're no longer in his realm. Now we must leave.
FATHER: Fantasma!! Teras!!
MARIUS: Stop her, Lestat!
MARIUS: You must!
MARIUS: I will not have you put everything at risk! You will mind our laws!
MARIUS: We remain in the shadows. To do otherwise is a road to
MARIUS: ( quietly ) I see you still have a few lingering mortal emotions. They will serve you no good, Lestat.
LESTAT: My God, what have you done to me?
LESTAT: ( whisper ) She's just a child. forgive me.
YUPPIE: Wow. This is the coolest after hours club ever. You sure you don't want a drink?
VAMPIRE GIRL: The Vampire Girl smiles, glances up at Jesse as she passes. Jesse looks away quickly, moves on. The pianist watches as she passes by. The couple necking in the corner begins to get even more aroused. A mortal girl sips on her drink while her lover, a vampire, kisses her shoulder, her throat.
JESSE: Sure, all the time.
JESSE: You haven't seen the rest of my Is that an invitation? So, where's your host?
JESSE: My host. oh he's here somewhere.
JESSE: 72 HOODED FIGURE 72 73 BACK TO SCENE 73
JESSE: Marius has the blood of the ancients flowing in his veins.
JESSE: That's a myth. Marius is around here somewhere.
JESSE: You. you really should meet him.
JESSE: Because. because. he's wise, a philosopher. he asks the big questions. Like how are you going to get through eternity? It's easier for us mortals. Life is brief, but for you.
JESSE: I mean. what can you really do with immortality besides just slip from one day to the next, trapped in a void of meaninglessness, relieved only by your next victim? How do you not give in to despair and just wither away from boredom,
JESSE: You know, it's like they say the more things change, the more they stay the same. For you that's forever, right?
JESSE: You saved me.
LESTAT: Perhaps. So you know Marius.
JESSE: I know a lot of things.
LESTAT: Not how to stay alive apparently.
JESSE: Well I guess we've got that in common. Although I think I'm a little ahead in the race here.
LESTAT: ( a beat, surprised Well, I can fix that.
JESSE: 'Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young.' It's about the girl with the violin, isn't it?
LESTAT: Is it? And what else do you think you know?
JESSE: ( desperate, I. I think you're a lot like Marius, Lestat.
LESTAT: ( staring into her Am I? Tell me all about it.
JESSE: You're. you're both artists. He's a painter. You're a singer.
LESTAT: Is that so? What I do is art, is Yes. From nothing. you try to create. something beautiful. . out of the. the cold, dark wasteland of eternity.
JESSE: Yes. From nothing. you try to create. something beautiful. . out of the. the cold, dark wasteland of eternity.
LESTAT: ( softly ) Something beautiful.
JESSE: ( quickly ) But. but Marius isn't a rebel. You're different in that way. You don't want to hide, follow the laws, concealed in the shadows like some insect. You. you still want to walk with the living, don't you, Lestat?
LESTAT: Well, I'm not hiding now, am I? No, but the only time you're not really alone is when you kill. But, Lestat, you can't help it. it's not your fault. He made you this way.
JESSE: No, but the only time you're not really alone is when you kill. But, Lestat, you can't help it. it's not your fault. He made you this way.
LESTAT: ( with her blood on Ah. Poor, poor me.
LESTAT: Well, Talamascan, you're certainly a very clever librarian, aren't
LESTAT: ( shaking his head ) How sad, you people always trying to know the unknowable. So, was it a good read? My diary.
LESTAT: Talamasca's been following me for years. I've never known one to be so brave. Or is it just foolish?
JESSE: I. I'm only an apprentice.
LESTAT: Go. I'm through with you. Your kind never satisfies my thirst.
JESSE: Does anything, Lestat?
JESSE: I mean, what's the point of coming into the light if not to have someone really know you?
JESSE: You want the world to see you're real, don't you, Lestat? Don't you? Well, here I am!
LESTAT: You better just stick to your books, Talamascan. 'Cause you have it all wrong. I love all this. I delight in it. The dark, dreary world I went to sleep in has burnt itself out and been replaced by the 20th Century can you imagine my joy at waking up to discover such a world? It has outdistanced my wildest dreams of it. I scream of good and evil, and mortals stand and cheer. I adore being back in action. every moment, every single drop of it! Now consider yourself exceedingly lucky and go!
JESSE: He turns back, stares at her, astonished.
JESSE: There's something you left out of your diary.
LESTAT: ( amazed ) ( stares right into his eyes )
JESSE: ( stares right into You kept her violin, didn't you?
JESSE: Hey, it's okay. I understand. After all, it's only human.
JESSE: Jesus Christ.
GROUPIE #2: I heard that Lestat keeps all these girls in all his wine cellars, and it's really nice, and they give you food and cable and weed.
GROUPIE #1: Oh, please.
GROUPIE #2: That's what I heard. But you have to let him suck you on your neck whenever he wants. Doesn't sound too bad.
GROUPIE #1: ( grins ) We've done worse.
GROUPIE #2: ( giggling ) Damn straight. Hey, do you remember that cute guy's name at the Kid Rock concert? The one behind the bathroom.
GROUPIE #1: Oh yeah. Let me think. his first name was Blow. And his second name was Me, I think.
LESTAT: ( softly ) Clever, clever librarian.
ROGER: I didn't see you come in.
LESTAT: No, Roger, you wouldn't have.
ROGER: So this house is fine I assume. To your liking?
LESTAT: Yes. For the moment.
ROGER: We'll be here for what? A week you think?
LESTAT: Well. I wouldn't unpack if I were you.
ROGER: ( sighs ) Right. the. girls you asked for. They're in the guest wing.
LESTAT: Ah. Yes.
ROGER: Do you want me to take them home
LESTAT: No, thank you, Roger. I'll make sure they're taken care of.
LESTAT: I don't think we've met.
GROUPIE #1: Oh my God. It's really you, isn't it?
GROUPIE #2: We want to be your slaves.
LESTAT: Of course you do.
GROUPIE #1: Want some?
GROUPIE #1: Want me?
GROUPIE #1: You hungry?
LESTAT: I'm always hungry.
GROUPIE #1: We've got the munchies? You got any food?
LESTAT: Vampires don't eat. food.
GROUPIE #1: You hungry for something else?
LESTAT: Mine eyes dazzle, she died so It's a very old poem of mine.
GROUPIE #1: It's a very old poem of mine.
LESTAT: It's a very old poem of mine.
GROUPIE #1: C'mon, don't you want to have some fun?
LESTAT: Don't do that.
GROUPIE #1: ( giggling ) Are you ticklish?
LESTAT: ( deadpan ) I'm very ticklish.
GROUPIE #2: Hey, you ever been tickled by four hands at once? Hey, can you take both us, Lestat? What'd'ya think?
LESTAT: I don't know. Let's see.
JESSE: You're right, David. The journal has everything in it.
JESSE: David, listen. I'm going to Los Angeles for the What? You are not! I forbid it.
JESSE: David, I. I talked to him. Look I'm sorry. But I. I have to see what's out there with my own eyes. I'm onto something. I just don't know what yet. I have to find out.
TALBOT: Jesse, you listen to me very, very carefully now. You are no longer seeing things clearly. Your emotions are clouding things.
JESSE: It's not emotion. It's instinct. I'll return when I have my findings. Good-bye.
LESTAT: No answer. Lestat looks around wondering what to do. Taking a candelabra off the table, he ventures down the stairs, peering down into the darkness.
LESTAT: They're. alive. Would you like me to play for you?
LESTAT: Would you like me to play for you?
MARIUS: What have you done, Lestat?
MARIUS: ( quietly )
LESTAT: I don't think so, my little lord.
MARIUS: I don't think so, my little lord.
LESTAT: Let me go!
MARIUS: No. You've drunk the purest blood. Seen the oldest of things far too much for one as young as you. You've been unconscious for days.
LESTAT: God, her blood is like liquid Who are they?
MARIUS: She. she is your mother, my mother. Akasha, the Queen of all who are damned. And he is her Release me!
LESTAT: Release me!
MARIUS: She made you quite powerful. Don't make me use this!
LESTAT: Marius, please, just one more time. I felt the sun. The light, Marius, the light!
MARIUS: Lestat, listen to me! I have watched over Akasha and her King for 2000 years! They must never
MARIUS: Akasha and her King nearly drank this earth dry when they ruled over Egypt. They drank until they lost their will to drink. They became living statues. And yet Akasha still sustains the life force of all vampires. It is believed what happens to her, happens to all of us.
MARIUS: If she were ever to rise, she would again desiccate the earth! She has no respect for anything except the taste of blood. Immortal and human alike.
LESTAT: You'll not stop me.
MARIUS: I hear her blood in your voice. In all the years I've cared for them, not once have they moved.
LESTAT: Until tonight. And she chose me! Me! Never you! You'll not stop
MARIUS: You are part of a great coven! You take responsibility for your I must have more!
LESTAT: ( snarls ) I must have more!
MARIUS: I chose you for your bravery, but I was wrong. You know only selfishness. I can no longer trust you. It gives me no pleasure to look upon what I have created.
LESTAT: No response.
LESTAT: Marius! Please!
JESSE: 110 WIDER 110
JESSE: Jesse looks up to see the real ATTENDANT is standing next to her.
ATTENDANT: We've started our approach into L.A. You should fasten your seat
LESTAT: I hate bedtime.
LESTAT: ( whisper )
MARIUS: ( CONTINUED )
MARIUS: It is good to see you, Lestat.
LESTAT: And you. Still wearing the old fashions, I see.
MARIUS: Old habits die hard.
LESTAT: How did you manage to slip through the 1950s in red velvet?
MARIUS: I slept.
LESTAT: Don't think you missed much.
MARIUS: Elvis, yes.
LESTAT: Elvis, yes.
MARIUS: ( holding up the You're bigger than he is now.
LESTAT: I'd say a few pounds lighter. Though, if you ever catch me wearing a white jumpsuit, you have my permission to slice off my If someone doesn't get to you
MARIUS: If someone doesn't get to you
LESTAT: Live and let live.
MARIUS: If it were only so simple, my son.
LESTAT: ( a beat ) How did you find me?
MARIUS: You forget. We ancients have powers no ordinary vampires possess. And I know you. I remembered how you admired the medieval fortresses in the hilltowns of Lyon. All you're missing is the moat and the cannons. which you may need.
LESTAT: Come, let me show you what it means to live in the light.
MARIUS: ( sarcastic ) Impressive. Reminds me of mad old Druids running around chanting in the forest. Very primitive stuff.
LESTAT: Out there. My fans. Thousands and thousands. They worship me. Millions of arms reach out to embrace, beg me to come into their It's what you've always wanted.
MARIUS: It's what you've always wanted.
LESTAT: With all my black little heart.
MARIUS: Do you think of anyone but I only have myself.
LESTAT: I only have myself.
MARIUS: It may be time to get ready for some company.
LESTAT: What's that supposed to mean?
MARIUS: Your music's woken a very old
MARIUS: Can't you hear it? Or is the applause all you can hear now?
MARIUS: Akasha has risen. She has taken her King's blood. Absorbed his power. You've done it this time.
LESTAT: Good! I'm glad she's risen! Let her come.
MARIUS: Don't you understand? You must stop this concert!
LESTAT: ( shakes his head at 200 years and the same broken No. Not the same! You've only known Akasha dormant. She too will find you. She is choosing her moment. She has come to destroy you, Lestat. And in her wrath, she will devour everything that moves. Mortal and vampire ( smiles at Marius, Well then, it's every vampire for himself. Just the kind of rules I like. The rules you taught me.
MARIUS: No. Not the same! You've only known Akasha dormant. She too will find you. She is choosing her moment. She has come to destroy you, Lestat. And in her wrath, she will devour everything that moves. Mortal and vampire Well then, it's every vampire for himself. Just the kind of rules I like. The rules you taught me.
LESTAT: ( smiles at Marius, Well then, it's every vampire for himself. Just the kind of rules I like. The rules you taught me.
LESTAT: Do you remember your first words to me, Marius? 'I am unknowable.' I'd rather not exist at all than have to live eternally as a ghost.
MARIUS: And you're taking everyone with you, you fool! We were once mortals, too. It is our heritage we protect!
LESTAT: ( moving away ) Such reverence for mortals! Then you should have left me as one!
MARIUS: You're a monster.
LESTAT: ( shakes his head with a Said the vampire to his son.
AKASHA: Her eyes sweep the room, taking in every inch, searching, then she hears a Vampire Lestat VIDEO PLAYING. She whirls around quickly to the TV gazes at the video intensely. Her eyes narrow, focus on Lestat, speaks as if to herself.
AKASHA: Hmmm. his scent is fading. He was here too long ago.
VAMPIRE LOVER: You like him, love?
AKASHA: ( still staring at TV ) He reminds me of someone I know.
VAMPIRE LOVER: All he's gonna remind you of soon is a pile of bones. We're gonna dismember him. Bleed him dry.
AKASHA: Really? Is that what you're going to do?
AKASHA: Then again, you could always do
AKASHA: Turn up the music!
AKASHA: ( smiles, to herself ) Oh, I do love the 21st Century.
AKASHA: Lesta-at. come out, come out wherever you are.
MAEL: Marius, you've broken your oath. You were to watch over Akasha and Khayman. You are a great disappointment to me.
MARIUS: Pandora, Armand, it's been a long time. Khayman, Maharet, to what do I owe this honor?
KHAYMAN: You have been summoned because of your errant child.
PANDORA: ( giving deep, He's quite the devil, isn't he?
ARMAND: His music mocks us, Pandora!
PANDORA: His music moves my blood.
ARMAND: Keep your amorous thoughts to yourself. His music is a threat to all vampires. We will let the covens dismember him at his
MAEL: Yes. It will set an example.
MARIUS: I don't see how this solves things. This isn't thought Marius, we understand your affection for Lestat, but your duty is to us!
KHAYMAN: Marius, we understand your affection for Lestat, but your duty is to us!
KHAYMAN: We could always get rid of him right now.
MAEL: No. We will contact the covens. Let them know we condone the slaying. It will be better for all to see.
MAHARET: Wait. Never mind Lestat! We have greater problems.
MARIUS: ( stepping up ) Maharet is right. It is Akasha we face now.
PANDORA: ( joyous ) Is it true, Maharet? Has our Queen really risen!
MAHARET: Don't be so happy, Pandora. I knew Akasha when she walked this earth. I was her slave. I am now her enemy. I know what she is capable of.
ARMAND: Yes. We've all felt her presence, even as she hides from us. What does she want now?
MAHARET: She knows only one thing. Taking pleasure in destroying life. She is already killing the young ones to build her strength.
MARIUS: She's sucked the life out of her King like a praying mantis. I sense she is getting closer.
MAHARET: She has come to destroy Lestat, but he will only whet her thirst
MAHARET: If we act together, we have a chance to destroy her.
MAHARET: Yes! We must destroy her immediately! If she is not stopped, I'm afraid of what will happen to the entire mortal world.
MAEL: But can she be destroyed? I am left to bear the scars of the last attempt on her life. She was dragged into the sun. She survived. But we almost didn't.
MARIUS: What happens to our Queen happens to us. If Akasha dies, we die as well.
MAHARET: Then so be it! We must take that
MAHARET: We must destroy Akasha. For the sake of humanity! We must find her. Now!
ARMAND: But perhaps she has come to kill Lestat and then will go back to her slumber. That is our only hope.
PANDORA: ( eager ) Yes. That's right. She and the covens will take care of that brat. We must go to the concert and pay our respects to our great How? With your own throat! You've all been asleep too long! You're still dreaming.
MAHARET: How? With your own throat! You've all been asleep too long! You're still dreaming.
MARIUS: Maharet speaks the truth. It is our only hope.
MAEL: No. Armand is right. We will go to the concert and first see what she does. There may be no need for action.
MAHARET: Then you go to the concert and you shall see! And I thought the Ancients became wise with their years.
ROGER'S POV: A Goth girl on the street in front of a record store.
JESSE'S POV: Roger's back is TO us as he talks to a Goth girl in a BACK TO JESSE Jesse pays the driver. Gets out. Gazes at Roger.
ROGER: The. girls you asked for, Lestat. They're here, in the guest wing.
LESTAT: Ah. Yes.
ROGER: I was uh. just gonna go catch a movie at the Chinese. I don't suppose you'd all want to.
LESTAT: No, thank you, Roger. We'll entertain ourselves.
GROUPIE #3: Oh my God, it's him! It's really
LESTAT: Perhaps you would like a tour of the place. first.
GROUPIE #3: Oh yeah, wow, we'd love that.
LESTAT: Roger. would you be so kind?
ROGER: ( surprised, relieved ) Sure. Right this way, girls. Roger. Not that one. Leave her to me.
LESTAT: Roger. Not that one. Leave her to me.
LESTAT: You must be very keen to die.
LESTAT: The Talamascans have become quite stealthy. I didn't know infiltration was quite their style.
JESSE: It's not. I. I came on my own.
LESTAT: How did you find me?
JESSE: I've been tracking your manager for days. Then I figured out you simply have to look the part.
LESTAT: Clever librarian. You should know, based on all your research, that groupies don't ever find their way out of here again.
JESSE: I'm not a groupie. Then why are you following me? What do you want?
LESTAT: Then why are you following me? What do you want?
JESSE: ( terrified, in Are you granting wishes?
LESTAT: ( smiles, in a whisper Last wishes. What's yours?
JESSE: Show me what it's like to be you. That's my last wish. Grant it,
LESTAT: ( turning away ) I don't have time for this.
JESSE: All a vampire has is time.
LESTAT: Maybe not.
JESSE: ( softly ) Right. The covens are coming for I understand why you're doing it. You have to be who you are, no matter what happens.
JESSE: But how are you spending what may be your last night on Earth, Lestat? As you always have.
JESSE: Don't kill me yet. Let's spend our last nights together. Share it with me. Show me what it's like to be you.
LESTAT: You don't know what you're asking! I don't know what's in that librarian's head of yours, but it's not what you think.
JESSE: That's right. You don't know what's in my head, Lestat. Do you want to?
LESTAT: I'll know when I kill you.
JESSE: Gee, Lestat, that's a great way to get to know someone. Here. I'll give you a preview. Coming attractions. This is what you'll
JESSE: I have this recurring dream that I'm a child and I'm living in this big house filled with vampires. And every night when I go to sleep, I wish to God the same thing. you know what that is, Lestat?
JESSE: That I will have the dream again. Because in the dream I'm happy. And the dream is more real than my life. I don't know how, but I know you, Lestat. My life is a big mystery and you, you have the
JESSE: I can't go on pretending this life of mine is real. I can't live a lie. I'm just like you Lestat. We're the same.
LESTAT: ( softly ) Are we? I seek the light. You seek the shadows.
JESSE: No. We're looking for exactly the same thing. You know it. Please. Show me.
LESTAT: Jesse breaks into a smile.
LESTAT: This may be painful for a mortal. You're still attached to your skin.
JESSE: ( an excited whisper ) I don't care.
LESTAT: Close your eyes. Don't breathe.
JESSE: Do that again!
LESTAT: And now for my next trick.
JESSE: Did it hurt?
LESTAT: Yes. For just a moment. But as the pain is more intense for us, so is ecstacy. You see, we love our victims.
JESSE: Love? I thought it was the blood.
LESTAT: No, although the taste is so rich and sweet. Love is the essence of the dark gift. The connection is so much more satisfying, brief as it is, than anything else.
LESTAT: As you drink, you feel the heart weakening. it struggles even though there's no hope. You feel the life slipping away, the flash of those brief years. The taste of mortality you can no longer experience. and it is No 'relationship,' no commingling can ever reach the heights of that Your blood.
LESTAT: ( groans ) Your blood.
JESSE: ( murmurs ) Do you like it?
LESTAT: ( losing himself )
JESSE: ( whispering, overcome ) Do it to me. Please. With your blood I'll know you.
JESSE: I'll know everything.
LESTAT: You want to know everything. You want to see what it's like. Then come! I'll show you.
JESSE: Is she alright?
LESTAT: Come closer, Jesse. You want to see? You want to know?
JESSE: Lestat, no!
LESTAT: You see now? Are you ready? Now do you want it?!
LESTAT: No. Of course you don't.
LESTAT: Well I didn't grant your final It was an impossible wish to begin with. You see, I am unknowable.
JESSE: Lestat! Wait!
LESTAT: Good-bye, Talamascan.
YOUNG JESSE: ( furious ) Why can't I stay with you?! Please, Auntie Maharet!
MAHARET: I don't want you to go, but you
YOUNG JESSE: Auntie, you're bleeding. You must be with your own, my sweetest girl. I'll always be watching over you.
MAHARET: You must be with your own, my sweetest girl. I'll always be watching over you.
YOUNG JESSE: I want to stay with you forever.
MAHARET: Forever is a very long time.
MAHARET: Hello, my princess.
JESSE: Aunt Maharet?
JESSE: You're a.?
MAHARET: Yes. Oh, Jesse, I've missed you so much, but I had to keep this from you.
JESSE: Oh my God, this is why. I knew I was different. I knew
MAHARET: ( strongly )
MAHARET: You are the most precious of my great family.
JESSE: Am I.?
MAHARET: ( strongly ) No. You are not. I was once mortal, too. My sister died before her child was one year old. I took care of that child, and her children, and her children's
MAHARET: This is our family my way of coping with eternity. The labyrinth of life. The family teaches me the rhythms and passions of each age.
MAHARET: You are my most prized light. You are what keeps me connected to the world of the living.
MAHARET: When your parents died I took you to India to take care of you.
JESSE: And something happened there.
MAHARET: I stopped it from happening. And I will again.
MAHARET: Jesse, you must stay away from Lestat. You must forget all about
MAHARET: Yes, I know about your new friend. You think you love him, but it's not as you thought it would be. I thought I was like him.
JESSE: I thought I was like him.
MAHARET: I know, but it is not who you are, not who you are meant to be. You have found that out now.
JESSE: Lestat's all I can think about. I felt like I belonged with him. Now I know why.
MAHARET: Jesse, you must forget about him. You must trust me.
JESSE: ( gazes up at her I missed you so much, Aunt Me too.
MAHARET: Me too.
MAHARET: You will go home to London in the
JESSE: But this is my home. This is where I belong. Why do you want to get rid of me so quickly?
MAHARET: Now is not the time to be here.
MAHARET: You were seeking answers. Now you have found them. The family is who you are.
MAHARET: You will go home to London
LESTAT: ( whisper )
CONTINUOUS ACTION: Jesse moves to the front entrance, gazes at the walls surrounding the front gate.
VAMPIRE DRIVER: Need a ride?
JESSE: ( smiles )
MARIUS: ( quietly ) Hello, David.
MARIUS: I must show you my new paintings
PANDORA: ( wistful, to Mael ) It's just like Nero's day.
MAHARET: Akasha will not be able to resist
ROGER: They're getting pretty worked up out there.
LESTAT: Come on, children.
LESTAT: I'm so glad I decided to rise. After tonight, Death Valley will live up to its name!
ENGINEER #1: ( Cockney accent ) Could we turn it down a tad?
ENGINEER #2: His mic's not even up.
LESTAT: You want more?!
CROWD: This one's for those who've come for me!
LESTAT: This one's for those who've come for me!
PANDORA: There are too many of them! They're going to dismember him.
ARMAND: 174 BACK TO STAGE 174
LESTAT: Get out of here!
JESSE: Lestat! Lestat!
MARIUS: ( soft, to himself )
MAHARET: She is here.
FIRE MARSHAL: You don't have a permit for any of these stunts!
ROGER: I told you I don't know anything about it!
ROGER: Last time I work for a bloody
JESSE: Lestat! Lestat!
LESTAT: Akasha still says nothing she advances with a luscious, curling smile.
AKASHA: Why so surprised, my love? You called, and I have come.
AKASHA: Never fear me, Lestat. Your wishes have all come true.
LESTAT: My wishes.?
AKASHA: You have yearned for a companion to share eternity. You have cried out to the world. I have answered your call.
AKASHA: You are so bold, like your music. It woke me. You live your life in the open, like I did long ago, when I had a King.
LESTAT: Had a King?
AKASHA: He's no more. You are my consort. I've kept you safe alive.
LESTAT: ( CONTINUED )
AKASHA: You thought it was all you? You have the ego of a king as well. I know you, Lestat. I know that you crave to have the world at your feet. I have come to give it to you.
AKASHA: Has your tongue lost its taste for But you didn't kill the mortal
LESTAT: ( melting ) But you didn't kill the mortal
AKASHA: But you didn't kill the mortal
AKASHA: Instead you kissed her. Now kiss
AKASHA: Be my King. Forget about everything else.
AKASHA: What's your answer?
LESTAT: Can we try that again?
LESTAT: Show me the world.
MAHARET: We see now what Akasha means to do. Rule as Queen again. This is why we must fight Akasha! For the sake of all mortals. She must be stopped, or the mortal world will end.
MAHARET: For the sake of all mortals. She must be stopped, or the mortal world will end.
MAEL: But is there a way? We don't When she opens herself to give her blood, she is vulnerable.
KHAYMAN: When she opens herself to give her blood, she is vulnerable.
MARIUS: Then we weaken her. Drain her of almost all her blood, but leave her just one drop.
MAHARET: We can't take that chance. We must finish her.
ARMAND: If she dies, we all die.
PANDORA: We're damned no matter what
MAHARET: Maharet gazes at them, her mind working. Pandora, Khayman, Mael gaze at each other, still uncertain.
JESSE: And what about Lestat?
MAHARET: Lestat has joined with Akasha. He is lost to us now. He is never coming back.
JESSE: I don't believe that.
LESTAT: Where are we?
AKASHA: We are home.
LESTAT: You live here?
AKASHA: We live everywhere and anywhere we choose. The world is our garden.
LESTAT: So warm. . their blood.
AKASHA: . yes.
LESTAT: . they're mortal.
AKASHA: . of course. They serve the living goddess, and her consort. They find you beautiful. You are a god in their eyes.
AKASHA: Behold our Kingdom.
LESTAT: ( CONTINUED )
AKASHA: ( puzzled ) Why not?
LESTAT: This is the reason you have risen?
AKASHA: They believed in nothing, now they are nothing. But you and I will change all that. We will give the world something to believe in
AKASHA: Come, my King. We have a score to
MARIUS: She comes.
AKASHA: My children. It warms my blood to see you all gathered. plotting against me.
MAHARET: Maharet. You will address my King first.
AKASHA: Maharet. You will address my King first.
JESSE: He turns slowly to the corner where she sits. They lock eyes. Lestat's face stares cold and hard.
JESSE: What has she done to you?
LESTAT: Made me see. Lestat. step aside.
MARIUS: Lestat. step aside.
LESTAT: Never. She is my Queen.
MAHARET: Akasha. The world has changed since you reigned.
AKASHA: Then we shall change it back. Humans are animals, brute creatures. Their destruction can only make sense.
MAHARET: We've found other ways to co- Yes. In the shadows. In silence. In shame. For what? For respect of mortals? They are nothing to us. They are only. food.
AKASHA: Yes. In the shadows. In silence. In shame. For what? For respect of mortals? They are nothing to us. They are only. food.
AKASHA: Poor Maharet. Still trying to hold onto what I took from you.
MARIUS: Akasha, please.
AKASHA: ( venomous ) You think you can change my will? I'm tired of this discussion. Join me, or die.
MAHARET: I will not.
MARIUS: I will not.
AKASHA: I want to hear it from every one of you. What will it be?
AKASHA: Don't tell me, you have feelings for these ridiculous mortals!
AKASHA: Do you love me?
LESTAT: He draws closer. Jesse stares, mortified. Akasha and Lestat's mouths almost meet when Akasha pulls away. Akasha slowly turns to Jesse.
AKASHA: Prove it. Kill her.
LESTAT: She's nothing to me.
AKASHA: Just the same, I'd like you to kill her. For me. I've had enough of this 'great family.' It's time to end it.
MAHARET: You will not touch her!
AKASHA: You still think to challenge me, I beg you, spare this child.
MAHARET: I beg you, spare this child.
AKASHA: Maharet struggles but Akasha is too strong. Jesse gazes at Lestat. Then steps forward.
JESSE: It's all right, Maharet. It's what I want. I am ready.
JESSE: It's what I want. I am ready.
AKASHA: ( smirking ) How sweet.
AKASHA: Good-bye, great family.
AKASHA: Now, my children, remember your real family! Or else.
LESTAT: But, My Queen, you've forgotten my
AKASHA: That's right. My King, you've just earned your crown.
AKASHA: You see how he obeys. You will or you will all die!
AKASHA: That's enough, Lestat.
AKASHA: Lestat. Enough. Stop!
AKASHA: You kill me, you kill yourselves.
MAHARET: Wait, Lestat! You must stop!
KHAYMAN: ( whisper ) We survived!
LESTAT: I left you one drop, my love. Drink deep and live.
JESSE: I thought I'd lost you.
LESTAT: Drink, my love.
LESTAT: I will never leave you again.
JESSE: ( CONTINUED )
MAHARET: My child, let me look at you. You are finally happy. It is as it should be now. I will watch over you always.
ARMAND: ( a reverent whisper ) She took Akasha's last drop, took Akasha's death into herself. Behold, our Queen. our new
JESSE: Is she. dead?
KHAYMAN: No, she will live forever. She sleeps. She sleeps, and dreams of
MARIUS: My Queen, I will watch over you
TALBOT: Jesse. My God.
JESSE: ( smiles ) David, this is Lestat.
TALBOT: How do you do?
LESTAT: Charmed, I'm sure.
JESSE: I told you I'd return with my findings. Here they are.
TALBOT: But please, sit down. You'll have to excuse me. it's just so. Strangely, no.
LESTAT: Strangely, no.
TALBOT: Strangely, no.
JESSE: Please don't be sad. I'm where I belong. I'm happy now.
TALBOT: Excuse me for asking but.
JESSE: ( smiles ) What's it like?
TALBOT: Do you want to find out?
JESSE: Do you want to find out?
TALBOT: Me?. No. I'm too old to live Well, if you ever should change your mind. Oh. I have a present for you. From an old friend.
JESSE: Well, if you ever should change your mind. Oh. I have a present for you. From an old friend.
JESSE: And Marius sent a message. You were right. He doesn't go to the Dorchester. But he's gonna be at Claridge's later.
JESSE: Well, I guess this is good-bye.
TALBOT: Yes. Take care of her, Lestat.
LESTAT: Talbot looks at Jesse, once his spiritual daughter.
TALBOT: Good-bye, Jesse.
JESSE: Good-bye, dear friend.
LESTAT: Shall we go get a drink, love?
