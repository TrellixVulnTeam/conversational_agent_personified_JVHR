THE QUEEN: Written by Peter Morgan
COMMENTARY: ..here's Tony Blair, just 43 years old, arriving at the polling station of his constituency in Sedgefield.."
ELIZABETH: Have you voted yet, Mr Crawford?
ARTIST: ( proudly dabbing palette ) Yes, Ma'am. I was there when they opened. First in line. Seven o'clock.
COMMENTARY: If he wins, he'll be the youngest Prime Minister in almost two hundred
ARTIST: And I don't mind telling you, it wasn't for Mr Blair.
ELIZABETH: Not a moderniser, then?
ARTIST: Certainly not. We're in danger of losing too much that's good about this country as it is.
TV COMMENTARY: "The only questions that still remain: how big will his landslide be? And how extensive, how sweeping will the modernisation programme be that he ushers in?"
ELIZABETH: The QUEEN watches as he paints..
ELIZABETH: I rather envy you being able to vote. Not the actual ticking of the box, although, I suppose, it would be nice to experience that ONCE. But the sheer joy of being partial.
ARTIST: The ARTIST squints as he scrutinises the canvass..
ARTIST: One forgets that as Sovereign, you are not entitled to vote.
ELIZABETH: Still, you won't catch me feeling sorry for you. You might not be allowed to vote, Ma'am.. But it IS your Government.
ARTIST: Still, you won't catch me feeling sorry for you. You might not be allowed to vote, Ma'am.. But it IS your Government.
ELIZABETH: The QUEEN raises her eyebrow..
ELIZABETH: I suppose that is some consolation.
MAID: G'morning, Ma'am.
DRESSER: Shall I draw the curtains?
DRESSER: Yes, Ma'am.
RESSER: Yes, Ma'am. Mr Blair, by a landslide.
ELIZABETH: I see.
JANVRIN: The Prime Minister is on his way, To BE, Robin. Prime Minister to BE.
ELIZABETH: To BE, Robin. Prime Minister to BE.
ELIZABETH: He's a hard one to read, isn't he?
JANVRIN: Yes. On the one hand his background is quite establishment. Father a Conservative. A public school education at Fettes, where he was tutored by the same man as the Prince of Wales.
ELIZABETH: Well, we'll try not to hold that against him.
JANVRIN: On the other, his manifesto promises the most radical modernisation and shake-up of the Constitution in three hundred years.
ELIZABETH: Oh. Is he going to `modernise' us, do you think?
JANVRIN: I wouldn't put it past him. He's married to a woman with known anti- Monarchist sympathies - you may remember her curtsey the first time you met. It could best be described as I don't measure the depth of a curtsey, Robin. I leave that to my And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary who said he was expecting the atmosphere at Downing Street to be very informal. Everyone on first name At the Prime Minister's insistence.

JANVRIN: The QUEEN's face puckers in distaste..
ELIZABETH: Oh. I'm not sure I like the sound of Have we sent him a protocol sheet?
TONY: Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.
HERIE: hy? You've met her often enough I know. But never one to one. And never as Prime Minister.

EQUERRY: When we reach the audience room, I will knock. We will not wait to be called, we will go straight inside. Standing by the door, we bow. From the neck. I will introduce you. The Queen will extend her hand, you go to her, bow again, then shake her hand.
TONY: And when you're in the Presence, at no point must you show your back.
EQUERRY: And when you're in the Presence, at no point must you show your back.
TONY: The `Presence'?
EQUERRY: Yes, Sir. That's what it's called, when you're in her Majesty's company. TONY turns, shoots a look at CHERIE, who sticks her fingers down her throat. TONY smiles back..
EQUERRY: Mr Blair, your Majesty.
ELIZABETH: Thank you, Ma'am.
TONY: Thank you, Ma'am.
ELIZABETH: Your children must be very proud.

ELIZABETH: First thing we do, I believe. Then we take your passport and spend the rest of the time sending you around the world.
TONY: You obviously know my job better than I do.
ELIZABETH: Well, you are my tenth Prime Minister, Mr Blair. I'd like to think there weren't too many surprises left. My first was Winston Churchill. He sat in your chair, in frock coat and top hat, and was kind enough to give a shy
T: young girl like me quite an education.
TONY: I can imagine.
ELIZABETH: ith time, one has hopefully added experience to that education, and a little wisdom - better enabling us to execute our constitutional To advise, guide and warn the government of the day.
TONY: Advice which I look forward to Now, if there's nothing else, I believe we have some business to attend to..
ELIZABETH: ell, we will save that for our weekly Now, if there's nothing else, I believe we have some business to attend to..
TONY: Of course..
TONY: Your Majesty, the country has spoken.and I come now to ask your permiss.. E
ELIZABETH: ( interjecting ) No, no, no. It's usual for ME to ask the questions.
ELIZABETH: Mr Blair, the people have elected you to be their leader. And so the duty falls on me, as your Sovereign, to ask you to become Prime Minister, and form a government in my name.
ELIZABETH: Generally, this is where you say The QUEEN extends her hand, which TONY kisses. She withdraws it again - quite sharply, then DISCREETLY PRESSES A BUZZER by her chair indicating the ceremony is over. The EQUERRY opens a door, and CHERIE is invited inside.

ELIZABETH: It's quite awful. What are you going to do about the An awkward moment. Stifled..
CHARLES: Let them sleep until we know more.
ELIZABETH: Yes that's sensible.
CHARLES: I should go to Paris. I told my people to start organising a jet.
ELIZABETH: What? A private one?
HARLES: Isn't that precisely the sort of extravagance they attack us for?
ELIZABETH: Isn't that precisely the sort of extravagance they attack us for?
CHARLES: ell, how else am I going to get to Paris at this time of night? The airport at Aberdeen will be closed.
QUEEN MOTHER: You can use the Royal Flight. They keep one of the planes on permanent In case I kick the bucket.
ELIZABETH: Out of the question. It's not a matter of State.
HARLES: What are you talking about?
ELIZABETH: Diana is no longer an HRH, nor a member of the Royal Family. This is a private matter.
CHARLES: She's mother to your grandchildren.
QUEEN MOTHER: That's the latest?
PRINCE PHILIP: I don't know. I can't hear.. Everyone's shouting!

CHARLES: ( reading the message ) My Private Secretary's office has found a travel agency open in New York that will sell me a flight to Paris with an hour's stop over in
CHARLES: Perhaps now you might consider whether it's still an extravagance to bring back the mother of the future King of England in one of our planes?
ELIZABETH: ( after a long pause ) All right.
ELIZABETH: ( to FOOTMAN ) I don't want the boys to see the news and get upset. First thing tomorrow morning, I want the radio taken out of their bedroom, and the television taken out of the nursery.
O: utside, the sound of bird-song. The first rays of light.
PRINCE PHILIP: Well, well, well.
ELIZABETH: PRINCE PHILIP
PRINCE PHILIP: Are you all right?
ELIZABETH: hope you told her to come back? Cut the holiday short?
PRINCE PHILIP: I did.
ELIZABETH: an't imagine she was pleased.
PRINCE PHILIP: That's putting it mildly.
ELIZABETH: What did she say?
PRINCE PHILIP: Something about Diana managing to be even more annoying dead than alive.
ELIZABETH: Just make sure the boys never hear you talk like that.
PRINCE PHILIP: Of course.
ELIZABETH: No. I'm going to do my diary a little Fine. I'll sleep next door.
PRINCE PHILIP: Fine. I'll sleep next door.
TONY: "..that's how she will remain. In our minds, our hearts, forever." OK, got it.

ELIZABETH: Thank you.
TONY: Is it your intention to make some kind of appearance. Or statement?
ELIZABETH: Certainly not.
ELIZABETH: No member of the Royal family will speak publicly about this. It is a private matter and we would all appreciate it if it could be respected as such.
TONY: I see.
TONY: I don't suppose anyone has had time to think about the funeral yet?
ELIZABETH: We've spoken to the Spencer family, and it's their wish.. ..their express wish, that it should be a private funeral. With a memorial service to follow in a month, or so.
TONY: TONY shoots a look at CHERIE..
ELIZABETH: Given that Diana was no longer a member of the Royal Family we have no choice but to respect their wishes.
TONY: I see.
TONY: You don't feel that in view of her high profile and popularity..
ELIZABETH: As I said. That's the Spencers' wish.
TONY: You don't think a private funeral would be denying them a chance..
ELIZABETH: hance to what..?
TONY: To share in the grief?
ELIZABETH: It's a family funeral, Mr. Blair. Not a fairground attraction. I think the Princess has already paid a high enough price for exposure to the press, don't you?
TONY: Of course.
TONY: Her instinct is to do nothing. Say nothing. And give her a private Are you surprised? She hated her guts.
CHERIE: Are you surprised? She hated her guts.

TONY: They screwed up her life. Let's hope they don't screw up her death.

ELIZABETH: Good. They'd like that.
AIDE: Alastair? He's on..

A: TONY shoots a look, `Who?' The AIDE covers the phone..
IDE: The Lord Chamberlain. In charge of the funeral. You're meeting him at the TONY nods. Takes the phone.
TONY: Lord Airlie.
AIRLIE: ( brisk, military ) Prime Minister. I'm responsible for organising all royal ceremonial ( a beat ) And there's simply no precedent for the funeral of an ex-HRH.
TONY: Then perhaps we should plan for any Yes. I've arranged a meeting tomorrow morning at 10.00 at Buckingham Palace. Officials from all three palaces, representatives from the Spencer Family, the emergency services. Would you send some of your people?
ORD AIRLIE: Yes. I've arranged a meeting tomorrow morning at 10.00 at Buckingham Palace. Officials from all three palaces, representatives from the Spencer Family, the emergency services. Would you send some of your people?
TONY: Absolutely. Of course.
TONY: ( mimicking )
TONY: Where do they find these people?
TONY: I'm so sorry, Sir. And if there's anything I or my Government can do.
CHARLES: They stood up as we drove past.in cafes.in restaurants. Removed their hats. This was Paris. One of the busiest cities in the world.and you could hear a pin drop.
TONY: I imagine it will be the same here.
CHARLES: Yes.I imagine it will.
CHARLES: The Palace would still prefer to see it as a private funeral. What are your feelings on that?

ELIZABETH: Have we heard from the Spencers again? Have they made up their minds when the funeral will be?
QUEEN MOTHER: Not me. No one tells me anything.
PRINCE PHILIP: n our walk today, one of the ghillies said he'd seen a large stag up at Craghie Head. He reckoned fourteen points.
QUEEN MOTHER: What? Really? We haven't had one that big on this estate in years.
PRINCE PHILIP: No. Quite.
PRINCE PHILIP: nyway, I thought it might be a good distraction. For the boys.
ELIZABETH: What? Stalking?
PRINCE PHILIP: I think anything that gets them outside is a good idea.
ELIZABETH: I'm sorry, I can't bear it. I'm going to bed.
L: ORD AIRLIE, ( whom we met at RAF Northolt ), checks the time. It's ten o'clock. He raps on a table, calling the meeting to
LORD AIRLIE: Right. It's ten o'clock. Let's make a start. Thank you all for coming at such notice. I think we all agree this is an extraordinarily sensitive occasion which presents us with tremendous challenges logistically.
ALASTAIR: Oh, Christ..
TONY: "..after eighteen years of Opposition, of frustration and despair, I am proud, privileged, to stand before you as the new Prime Minister."
IDE: Labour Prime Minister..
TONY: "I want to set an ambitious course to modernise this country. To breathe new life into our institutions. To make privilege something for the many, not the few. So that we become nothing less than a beacon to the world."

AIDE: Gordon for you.
TONY: Tell him to hang on.
LASTAIR: Yes. On Saturday. A whopper. The Abbey. The works.
TONY: Good. Has anyone told the Queen yet?
LASTAIR: Dunno. No doubt some flunkey will be despatched. Grovelling on all fours.
JANVRIN: Good morning, Ma'am.
J: The QUEEN looks up..
ANVRIN: The QUEEN looks up..
ELIZABETH: What can we do for you, Robin?
JANVRIN: Ma'am, there was a meeting at the Palace this morning.
ELIZABETH: About the funeral arrangements, yes.
JANVRIN: The Lord Chamberlain faxed over these plans for you to consider.
JANVRIN: There is now general agreement, Ma'am, that a public funeral would be more I see.
ELIZABETH: I see.
ELIZABETH: nd what form will it take?
JANVRIN: At the moment, they're suggesting.. And of course these are early days..
QUEEN MOTHER: Tay Bridge..?
ELIZABETH: A stunned silence..
QUEEN MOTHER: B-but that's the code name for my funeral? J
ANVRIN: ndeed, Ma'am. But it would be for practical reasons
ANVRIN: It's the only one which has been.. ..`rehearsed'. The only one that could be put together..in time.
QUEEN MOTHER: But I supervised those plans myself.
JANVRIN: Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain was at pains to stress the spirit of the occasion will be quite different. For example, in place of four hundred soldiers marching behind the coffin, the suggestion is that four hundred representatives from the Princess's various charities march behind the I see..
ELIZABETH: I see..
JANVRIN: And that instead of foreign Heads of State and Crown heads of Europe, the guests would include a sprinkling of actors of stage and screen, fashion designers and other.. The QUEEN looks ashen. The QUEEN MOTHER is pouring herself a Wa..was there anything else?
QUEEN MOTHER: The QUEEN looks ashen. The QUEEN MOTHER is pouring herself a
ELIZABETH: The QUEEN looks ashen. The QUEEN MOTHER is pouring herself a
JANVRIN: o, Ma'am.
JANVRIN: Oh, yes. One other thing. The Police Commissioner was keen that you consider the idea of a condolence It would give the growing crowds something to do. Make marshalling them Yes, of course..
ELIZABETH: ( distracted ) Yes, of course..
JANVRIN: Oh, and the flowers.
ELIZABETH: hat flowers?
W: hat flowers?
ELIZABETH: Fine. Then move them away.
JANVRIN: Actually, the Lord Chamberlain was wondering whether we shouldn't leave the flowers, and send the Guards through the North Gate.
ELIZABETH: Ye-es. Of course. Quite right.
AIDE: tephen Lamport on one.
TONY: The Prince of Wales's private secretary. In Balmoral. He said it was urgent.

TONY: Well, please thank his Highness, and assure him that he can count on my full support. At all times. Was that it?
LAMPORT: TONY hangs up. He turns to his AIDE..
AIDE: Creeping up to me like this. He did it at the airport when he asked me to `deal' with his mother.
TONY: Creeping up to me like this. He did it at the airport when he asked me to `deal' with his mother.
AIDE #2: ecause he knows that if the Queen continues to get it wrong over Diana, it won't be long before the Royals become public enemy no 1.
TONY: Who, Charles?
AIDE: His people have already been onto us asking for extra protection.
IDE #2: He probably thinks if he's seen to be on our side, the Queen will be the one left in the firing line, not him.
TONY: What? So it's OK for his mother to take the bullet, not him? What a family.
CHARLES: Wait! Where are they?
ELIZABETH: Up at Craigghead.
CHARLES: I'll come with you.
ELIZABETH: Certainly not.
CHARLES: I thought you were going to get a new
E: one of these?
ELIZABETH: What for? It's perfectly all right.
CHARLES: I was thinking last night what Diana might have done had it been me that died in the tunnel in Paris.
CHARLES: She would certainly have taken the boys to Paris. I rather regret not doing that now.
ELIZABETH: What? And expose them to the media? It would have been a dreadful thing to do. They're much better off here.
CHARLES: Look, whatever else you may have thought of Diana - she was a wonderful She adored those boys. And never let them forget it. Always warm.
CHARLES: And physical. Never afraid to show her feelings.
ELIZABETH: Especially whenever a photographer was in sight.
CHARLES: Yes, she MAY have encouraged all that, but still..
ELIZABETH: Not `us', dear.
CHARLES: ( not having heard )
CHARLES: Yesterday, when we drove the coffin back into London, there was a noise. A bang. I don't mind telling you I thought it was a gun.
E: Why don't you go on without me? I'm going to walk back..
ELIZABETH: Why don't you go on without me? I'm going to walk back..
CHARLES: Are you sure?
ELIZABETH: Yes. It looks like rain.. And I'm not in the mood for stalking CHARLES knows better than to contradict his mother. He gets into the driving seat, puts on the safety belt, and drives The Land Rover disappears in a cloud of dust.
ELIZABETH: Wait! My shoe-lace is undone. You don't want me to trip and hurt myself, do you? You wouldn't get any proper walks The QUEEN blissfully chatters away to the DOGS. So much easier than people.
ELIZABETH: Right. Done. Now who knows the way he DOGS yap excitedly, immediately scamper off in the direction of the castle..
ELIZABETH: You clever things!
ELIZABETH: I spoke to Charles this afternoon.
ELIZABETH: Who was good enough to share with me his views on motherhood.
PRINCE PHILIP: What did he say?
A: TV plays in the corner. DIANA, starved thin, panda-eyes, the infamous Martin Bashir `PANORAMA' interview..
ELIZABETH: How wonderful Diana was.
RINCE PHILIP: That's changing his tune.
ELIZABETH: What a natural.
PRINCE PHILIP: ( puckers face ) Oh, for God's sake..
ELIZABETH: Maybe he's got a point. Maybe we are partly to blame.
PRINCE PHILIP: I can't watch this.
ELIZABETH: No, wait. Leave it.
ELIZABETH: We encouraged the match. And signed off on it. Both of us. You were very enthusiastic, remember.
RINCE PHILIP: She was a nice girl. Then.
PRINCE PHILIP: And I was sure he'd give the other one up. Or, at least make sure his wife towed the line. Isn't that what everyone does?
ELIZABETH: Is it?
TONY: ..I don't know.something more interesting. Maybe this time people have finally seen them for what they Which is?
W: ..I don't know.something more interesting. Maybe this time people have finally seen them for what they Which is?
HERIE: ..I don't know.something more interesting. Maybe this time people have finally seen them for what they Which is?
TONY: Which is?
CHERIE: A bunch of freeloading, emotionally That's just absurd.
TONY: ( rolls eyes ) That's just absurd.
CHERIE: Why? They exist in a ludicrous cocoon of privilege and wealth. They don't pay tax.
TONY: Yes, they do.
CHERIE: The Queen alone costs us what? Thirty, forty million a year..
TONY: ot you, too. Look.if you want to have a serious conversation about I do..
CHERIE: I do..
TONY: ..about the Constitution..
CHERIE: e don't HAVE one..
TONY: .or about ways in which we as a Government could begin to phase out hereditary privileges, then fine.
HERIE: ( indicating plates ) If you're going, take the dishes..
TONY: But spare me the whole.."off with their heads" thing.
CHERIE: Because it insults your intelligence.
TONY: Because it insults your intelligence.
CHERIE: "The case for reform is simple and obvious. It is in principle wrong and absurd that people should wield power on the basis of birth, not merit or YOUR words, not mine.
TONY: Well, maybe now I've grown up. It's unimaginable this country being a republic. Certainly in her lifetime.
CHERIE: Because.no would would wear it. No one WANTS it. It's just.daft.
TONY: Because.no would would wear it. No one WANTS it. It's just.daft.
HERIE: It's not a mother thing, is it?
CHERIE: Think about it. If she were still alive, wouldn't Hazel be exactly the same age? Whenever you talk about your mother, you mention her stoicism. Her frugality. Her sense of duty. The fact she was brought up in the way. Well Who does THAT sound like?
TONY: I'm going to do the washing-up. F
ALASTAIR: All right, the good news is that the Palace has agreed to video screens in the Royal Parks.
TONY: And the bad news?
ALASTAIR: Crash barriers.
TONY: What about them?
ALASTAIR: hey're now predicting more than two million people will descend on London, and there aren't enough barriers to line the route. So we've gone cap in hand to the French for theirs. And there's something else I think you should see.
T: TONY follows ALASTAIR into an office where a television plays in the corner. Several young AIDES and INTERNS are watching, recording, making notes. Shirtsleeves, feet on desks.
ALASTAIR: Can we run that piece again? You're going to love this.
TONY: Look, I know all this..
ALASTAIR: ne member of the public complains about the flag..
TONY: Don't tell me. There isn't a flag flying at half mast above Buckingham TONY rolls his eyes to himself.
TONY: God. Will someone save these people from themselves..
F: ine. I'll call Balmoral.
ALASTAIR: `Planet Zog'?
TONY: Because as Prime Minister of this country, I've really got nothing better to do..
A: LAND ROVER pulls up. The QUEEN gets out with her dogs. She notices PHILIP's struggle with the bar-be-cue..
ELIZABETH: Those fire-lighters no good? I brought some stew just in case. I think it's lamb. We could always have that cold..
PRINCE PHILIP: No, we'll be all right.
ELIZABETH: Robin had a call from the Prime Minister. Who expressed his concern.
PRINCE PHILIP: About WHAT?
ELIZABETH: The flag above Buckingham Palace. He thinks it should be flying at half- The DOGS continue to P
RINCE PHILIP: Then I hope Robin told him there ISN'T a flag above Buckingham Palace. .only the Royal Standard, which flies for one reason only.
CHARLES: Isn't it possible..that to some people.the Royal Standard is just.. ..a flag? And that the flap pole being bare sends out the wrong signal.
ELIZABETH: That's not the point.
RINCE PHILIP: The point is it's more than four hundred years old. It has never been lowered for ANYONE..
QUEEN MOTHER: Your grandfather didn't get that flag at half-mast when he died and if your mother were to die tomorrow, she wouldn't get it either.
CHARLES: Yes.but sometimes.in a situation like this..one has to be flexible..
CHARLES: ( shrugs ) It is just a flag.
ELIZABETH: "What about the Union Jack?", was Mr. Blair's next suggestion.
UEEN MOTHER: ( rolling eyes ) Oh, for heaven's sake.
PRINCE PHILIP: The next thing he'll be suggesting you change your name to Hilda and mine to Who does he think he's talking to? You're the Sovereign. The Head of State. You don't get dictated to. You've conceded the idea of a public funeral. You've opened up the parks. That's ENOUGH.
ELIZABETH: Like those condolence books.
PRINCE PHILIP: Quite right. When we started with one, everyone predicted they would grow and grow. But we've heard nothing more about that, see?
CHARLES: Apparently there are now fifteen.
ELIZABETH: And people are queuing through the PHILIP stares. The QUEEN's expression changes.
CHARLES: And people are queuing through the PHILIP stares. The QUEEN's expression changes.
I: NT. BALMORAL CASTLE - CHARLES'S QUARTERS - DAY CHARLES crosses the saloon to his study, talking to his Private Secretary.
HARLES: In one sense its comforting. For the first time my parents can see what it's been like for me all these years, being up against her But they're still making the mistake of thinking the Diana they knew from living and dealing with her, will eventually be the one seen by the public. But it's not. The two Dianas, theirs and ours, bear no relation to one another at all.
CHARLES: I've been thinking is the flag flying at half mast over my house at Yes, Sir.
LAMPORT: Yes, Sir.
CHARLES: Make sure we get a picture of that in the papers, would you? If my mother wants to make a mess of this, that's her business. I won't let her drag me down, too.
C: Tony Blair in London. TONY and CHERIE watch..
HERIE: See? It isn't just me.
TONY: People really DO want change. And want YOU to give it to them.
CHERIE: People really DO want change. And want YOU to give it to them.
TONY: And do what? Cut off their heads?
HERIE: Apparently, one in six people now support the idea of getting rid of the That's just the papers spoiling for a But still, imagine this country without them? With a nice elected Head of State? That'd be some legacy. If the revolution were to happen on your LAIR stares. Visibly unsettled.

CHERIE: But still, imagine this country without them? With a nice elected Head of State? That'd be some legacy. If the revolution were to happen on your LAIR stares. Visibly unsettled.
ANVRIN: That's the stalking party off?
JANVRIN: Right, we'd better have a look at these papers.
S: "Show us there's a heart in the House of Windsor," says the Sun..
ECRETARY: "Show us there's a heart in the House of Windsor," says the Sun..
SECRETARY: It proves, the Royals are not like us", the Mirror. "Time to change the Old Guard at Buckingham Palace".
JANVRIN: ( heart sinks )
SECRETARY: "One can't help wondering who's advice they are taking for it's clearly the wrong advice."
JANVRIN: The SECRETARY puts down the INDEPENDENT, open on a page marked.."THE WINDSORS STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND US."
TONY: "People have been yearning for a change in this country." Good. "The result is a quiet revolution now taking place. Led by the real modernisers. The British People.."
T: TONY tails off..
TONY: `Revolution'? Not you, too? Who wrote this?
TONY: Where does it come from?
AIDE: Where does it come from?
IDE 2: Just look at the papers. Talk to people on the streets.
IDE: Something's happening out there.
TONY: The AIDES look at one another..
TONY: Right. You lot. Out.
AIDE: What about the speech?
TONY: The AIDES file out.
J: ..and finally, Ma'am, a DSO medal. A Corporal, in Kosovo..you may have read about it in the papers..pulled two civilians from a bus after a bomb The QUEEN signs the certificate of honour. PRINCE PHILIP calls out, indicating the tea..
ANVRIN: ..and finally, Ma'am, a DSO medal. A Corporal, in Kosovo..you may have read about it in the papers..pulled two civilians from a bus after a bomb The QUEEN signs the certificate of honour. PRINCE PHILIP calls out, indicating the tea..
PRINCE PHILIP: Hurry up, dear. Getting cold.
JANVRIN: Yes, Ma'am. Just the letter of condolence to the widow of the Ambassador to Brazil.
ELIZABETH: The QUEEN walks over to join PRINCE PHILIP for tea by the television, when JANVRIN turns, ( we notice his SECRETARY stands in the doorway )..
JANVRIN: Ma'am, apparently the Prime Minister is on the phone for you.
RINCE PHILIP: ( snaps ) Tell him to call back.
ELIZABETH: No, I'd better take it.
ELIZABETH: Prime Minister?
TONY: Good afternoon, your Majesty. I'm sorry to disturb. I was just NT. BALMORAL - QUEEN'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS PRINCE PHILIP indicates she should put TONY on speaker-phone. The QUEEN obliges. TONY's voice comes out..
TONY: .whether you'd seen any of today's The QUEEN looks at her desk. Most of the newspapers are strewn out in front of her..
ELIZABETH: We've managed to look at one or two, In which case, my next question would be - whether you felt some kind of response might be necessary?
TONY: In which case, my next question would be - whether you felt some kind of response might be necessary?
TONY: Under normal circumstances I would agree, but..P
RINCE PHILIP: ( under his breath ) Here we go! The bloody flag again..!
TONY: ..my advisers have been taking the temperature among people on the streets - and the information I'm getting is that the mood.. .is quite delicate.
PRINCE PHILIP: ( under his breath ) Of course. That's where all the ruddy cameras are.
ELIZABETH: So what would you suggest, Prime Minister? Some kind of statement?
TONY: No, Ma'am. I believe the moment for statements has passed.
TONY: I would suggest flying the flag at half-mast above Buckingham Palace.
PRINCE PHILIP: And coming down to London at the earliest opportunity.
TONY: And coming down to London at the earliest opportunity.
TONY: It would be a great comfort to your people and would help them with their THEIR grief?
ELIZABETH: THEIR grief?
ELIZABETH: If you're suggesting that I drop everything and come down to London before I attend to two boys that have just lost their mother..you're Absurd.. E
RINCE PHILIP: Absurd.. E
ELIZABETH: I doubt there are many who know the British more than I do, Mr. Blair, nor who has greater faith in their wisdom and judgement. And it is my belief that they will soon reject this `mood' which has been stirred up by the press.in favour of a period of restrained grief, and sober, private That's the way we do things in this country. Quietly. With dignity. It's what the rest of the world has always admired us for.
TONY: Well, if that's your decision, Ma'am, of course the government will support Let's keep in touch.
ELIZABETH: could hardly be less enthusiastic )
PRINCE PHILIP: Bloody fool.
PRINCE PHILIP: Now your tea's gone cold.
T: TONY hangs up the phone. He is lost in thought. His SECRETARY sticks her head around the door..
SECRETARY: Robin Janvrin on one. He must have been listening in.
TONY: Mr Janvrin?
JANVRIN: Prime Minister, I understand how `difficult' her behaviour must seem to you..how `unhelpful'..but try to see it from her perspective.. She's been brought up to believe its God's will that she is who she is.
TONY: I think we should leave God out of it. It's just not helpful.
JANVRIN: She won't have seen anything like this since the Abdication.
TONY: All right - but first we have to deal with these terrible headlines. I'll see what I can do with the Press.
JANVRIN: I'm most grateful, Prime Minister.
TONY: But I can't promise anything. It's not me they want to see.
TONY: Ask Alistair to come and see me will The Secretary nods and picks up the phone.
TONY: nd cancel whatever I'm doing tonight.
ELIZABETH: The QUEEN's eyes widen. Knowing that sound was serious.
ELIZABETH: Oh, you are stupid.
ELIZABETH: ( into phone ) Hello? Could you put me through to the Ghillies' office?
H: ello, Thomas? I'm afraid I've done something very foolish. I think I've broken the prop-shaft. Crossing the Are you sure, Ma'am?
HEAD GHILLIE: Are you sure, Ma'am?
ELIZABETH: Yes, perfectly. The front one, not the rear. I've lost the four-wheel drive. You forget I worked as a mechanic in the war.
HEAD GHILLIE: And are you all right?
ELIZABETH: Yes, perfectly, thank you. I'm so sorry to waste your time..
HEAD GHILIE: We'll come out straightaway.
ELIZABETH: Oh, will you? You are kind. Thank you. I'll wait by the car.
W: e only see her back. Presently, she reaches into her jacket pocket, produces a handkerchief, and dabs her eyes. Gradually, she composes herself.
ELIZABETH: Oh, you are a beauty.
CHERIE: I've just been told there are news crews outside waiting for you to come and "speak to the people."
TONY: What's that about?
HERIE: What's that about?
TONY: I told the Queen's private secretary I'd do what I could to help with the Why? Don't you think she deserves it? Sitting up there on her 40,000 acres.
CHERIE: Why? Don't you think she deserves it? Sitting up there on her 40,000 acres.
TONY: I know.but allowing her to hang herself might not be in our best interests either.
TONY: Besides, I think there's something.ugly about the way everyone's started to bully her.
T: he QUEEN is in bed, watching television. Staring.
V PRESENTER: ..earlier tonight the Prime Minister went out and pleaded with people to understand the Royals' behaviour..
ELIZABETH: How are the boys?
PRINCE PHILIP: Not so good tonight. A lot of slamming I think they saw the papers.
ELIZABETH: Oh, no..
PRINCE PHILIP: I'll take them out early again tomorrow morning.

RINCE PHILIP: MOURNER 2 ( ON TV )
PRINCE PHILIP: .and a hysteric.
PRINCE PHILIP: Oh, please..
PRINCE PHILIP: And they think we're mad?

PRINCE PHILIP: I suggest you keep it that way. A chorus line of soap stars and
PRINCE PHILIP: That'll be a first for Westminster
PRINCE PHILIP: Condolence books are now being signed in our embassies in every major city in the world. And in London alone the number has reached forty.
PRINCE PHILIP: stares at the CROWDS of MOURNERS on the television ) This reminds me of one of those films. A few of us in a Fort. Hordes of Zulus
P: silence. The TELEVISION coverage continues..
RINCE PHILIP: So it's VITAL you hold firm. Stick to your guns. You wait. They will come to their senses soon. They HAVE to.
PRINCE PHILIP: C'mon, move over, Cabbage.
T: ELEVISION PRESENTER
ELEVISION PRESENTER: It's six o'clock. Time for a look at the morning's newspapers. Jenny..
JENNY: Good morning. Well if you thought yesterday's headlines for the Royals couldn't get any worse - think again.
ALASTAIR: ( takes another paper )
T: he Sun - "Where is our Queen? Where is her flag?" The Express, "Show us you care", with a picture of a grumpy Queen. The Mail - "Let the Flag Fly at half- mast", and inside, "The Queen should be here to show her respects."
LASTAIR: Blimey! But the flip-side is. "Blair more popular than Churchill ALASTAIR expects TONY to be pleased, but instead he appears Did any of them pick up on our statement of support?
TONY: Did any of them pick up on our statement of support?
ALASTAIR: Just one.
TONY: TONY gets to his feet, and walks out. ALASTAIR watches
ANVRIN: The Prime Minister for you, Ma'am.
JANVRIN: I'm afraid he's rather insisting.
ELIZABETH: All right. I'll take it here. In the kitchens.
ELIZABETH: ood morning, Prime Minister.
T: Good morning, Ma'am.
TONY: Good morning, Ma'am.
ELIZABETH: Yes, I have.
TONY: Then I'm sure you'll agree. The situation has become quite critical.
TONY: As your Prime Minister, I believe it's my constitutional responsibility to ADVISE the following..
ELIZABETH: Is Queen Elizabeth up yet?
ELIZABETH: INT. BALMORAL - QUEEN MOTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY finishes getting dressed, ( attended by DRESSERS )..
ELIZABETH: One - lower the flag to half-mast above Buckingham Palace and all other Royal residences. Two - leave Balmoral, and fly down to London at the earliest opportunity. Three - pay respects in person at Diana's coffin. And four - make a statement via live television to my people and the world.
E: XT. BALMORAL GROUNDS - DAY he QUEEN and QUEEN MOTHER walk through the grounds: stout, resolute, waterproofs, rain. A glorious Scottish summer. Distant rumbles of thunder.
QUEEN MOTHER: bviously you're going to have to talk to the Lord Chamberlain about all I have.
ELIZABETH: I have.
UEEN MOTHER: And to Robert Fellowes.
ELIZABETH: To him too.
UEEN MOTHER: ELIZABETH ( cont'd )
QUEEN MOTHER: I see.
ELIZABETH: Something's happened. There's been a change.a shift of values..
QUEEN MOTHER: Certainly not! Remember the oath you "I declare that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service."
ELIZABETH: "I declare that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service."
QUEEN MOTHER: Your WHOLE life. That's a commitment to God as well as your people.
ELIZABETH: But if my actions are damaging the Damaging them? My dear, you are the greatest asset this institution has. One of the greatest it has EVER had. The problem will come when you leave, but that's not for you to worry about - and certainly not today.
QUEEN MOTHER: Damaging them? My dear, you are the greatest asset this institution has. One of the greatest it has EVER had. The problem will come when you leave, but that's not for you to worry about - and certainly not today.
ELIZABETH: Then drifts off, into her own thoughts
ELIZABETH: It's just no one seems to value tradition or constancy any more. It's all about show. About wearing your heart on your sleeve.
QUEEN MOTHER: And you're not like that. Never have been. No.you must show strength. Re- assert your authority. You sit on the most powerful throne in Europe. Head of an unbroken line that goes back more than a thousand years. How many of your predecessors do you imagine would have dropped everything and gone down to London because people holding candles wanted help with their grief? The QUEEN MOTHER's tirade continues, but the QUEEN is not listening. She knows she has a decision to make.
UEEN MOTHER: And as for Mr Blair and his Cheshire Cat grin.
GHILLIE: Mr Janvrin for you sir.
PRINCE PHILIP: Yes Robin..?
PRINCE PHILIP: What? It's madness! The whole thing! Bloody madness!
PRINCE PHILIP: It seems we are going back to London!
CHARLES: I've just been told. You've decided to go back to London.
T: he QUEEN's face. Avoids eye contact.
CHARLES: I just want to say - I admire. I think it's the right decision.
CHARLES: Let's hope we haven't left it too The QUEEN ignores him. CHARLES goes.
T: TONY looks up. Breathes a sigh of relief..
TONY: ( to himself ) Thank God for that.
TONY: Be right there.
CHERIE: I'm afraid they're a bit burned.
P: RINCE PHILIP
RINCE PHILIP: Where are the boys? Have they already Yes. They left for London after breakfast. With Charles.
ELIZABETH: Yes. They left for London after breakfast. With Charles.
PRINCE PHILIP: It's not right, you know
ELIZABETH: Yes, but further discussion is no longer helpful either.
PRINCE PHILIP: Oh, well. I suppose it gives the ghillies time to find a new stag for the boys now theirs has been shot.
ELIZABETH: The QUEEN momentarily stiffens..
PRINCE PHILIP: Haven't you heard? It wandered onto one of the neighbouring estates where it was shot by one of the commercial The blood has drained from her face..
ELIZABETH: The blood has drained from her face..
CAMPBELL: Here's your box. There's some
TONY: ( snaps, irritated ) I'm the Prime Minister. Of course I've seen the papers.
LASTAIR: ( in comic voice ) "Your Maj? Come down to London." "Who says so?" "Tony Blair."
ALASTAIR: "Mr. Father of the Nation."
HEAD GILLIE: Morning, Ma'am. Is it his Lordship you've come to see?
H: e reaches into his pockets for his cell-phone..
ELIZABETH: No, no..please don't disturb him. I've come on another matter. I hope you don't mind..
HEAD GILLIE: There he is..
ELIZABETH: e was wounded.
HEAD GILLIE: Yes. We got our guest in very close, had him lined-up perfect, and still.. ..an investment banker, Ma'am. From The QUEEN stretches her hand out, almost touches the wound..
ELIZABETH: voice cracks ) Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.
HEAD GILLIE: I will, Ma'am.
HEAD GILLIE: ( removing hat ) God bless you.
E: Yes, Robin..
ELIZABETH: Yes, Robin..
JANVRIN: I've done a draft of your television Thank you.
ELIZABETH: Thank you.
JANVRIN: No, Ma'am. Landing in fifteen minutes.
SECRETARY: I've got a copy of the Queen's speech.
SECRETARY: Shall I give Tony a copy?
LASTAIR: Let me have a look at it first.
PRINCE PHILIP: ( jaw drops ) Good God..
T: EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY - LIVE
ALASTAIR: They sent a copy of the Queen's ALISTAIR holds it between finger and thumb..
ALASTAIR: I made a couple of changes. So it sounds like it comes from a human ALASTAIR turns, walks towards the door..
ALASTAIR: Oh, and one bit of good news. The old boot's FINALLY agreed to pay respects at Diana's coffin.
TONY: You know when you get it wrong, you REALLY get it wrong. That woman has given her whole life in service to her people - fifty years doing a job she NEVER wanted - a job she watched kill her father. She's executed it with dignity, honour and, as far as I can tell, without a single blemish - and now we line up baying for her blood - why? Because she's struggling to lead the world in mourning for a woman who threw everything she offered back in her face, and who seemed, in the last few years, to be committed twenty-four seven to destroy everything she holds TONY storms off.
ELIZABETH: he LITTLE GIRL tries to curtsey..
LITTLE GIRL: LITTLE GIRL
ELIZABETH: LITTLE GIRL
LITTLE GIRL: They're for you.
ELIZABETH: ( visibly shocked ) For me..?
C: ROWDS of MOURNERS watch intently. The QUEEN takes the flowers, then turns and walks away, visibly shaken..
ANVRIN: Your Majesty, there's a last minute addition from Downing Street. They're suggesting adding `..and as a grandmother..' here.
ELIZABETH: The QUEEN makes a note on the text..
JANVRIN: You think you can say it?
ELIZABETH: Do I have a choice?
IRECTOR: We're ready for you, your Majesty..
DIRECTOR: Just to confirm this is going out And you'll be at the front of the six o'clock news on all the channels
ELIZABETH: And you'll be at the front of the six o'clock news on all the channels
DIRECTOR: And you'll be at the front of the six o'clock news on all the channels
ELIZABETH: I see.
FLOOR MANAGER: ( calling out ) Ten seconds, everyone..
ELIZABETH: Since last Saturday's dreadful news we have seen, throughout Britain and the world, an overwhelming expression of sadness at Diana's death..
I: NT. CHINESE ROOM - SAME TIME he QUEEN continues..
ELIZABETH: We have all been trying in our different ways to cope. The initial shock is often succeeded by a mixture of other feelings. Disbelief, incomprehension, anger and concern for those who remain.
CHERIE: "Heart"? What "heart". She doesn't mean a word of this.
TONY: That's not the point. What she's doing is extraordinary. That's how you survive.
CHERIE: Listen to you! A week ago you were the great moderniser, making speeches about the "People's Princess", now you've gone weak at the knees.
CHERIE: I don't know why I'm surprised. In the end, all Labour Prime Ministers go ga- ga for her Maj.
DIRECTOR: ( calls out ) And we're out..!
D: IRECTOR ( cont'd )
T: he entire distraught, tearful NATION it seems, has come out onto the streets to pay their final respects.
CHERIE: So? Off to see your girlfriend?
TONY: Now, now..
CHERIE: I hope she shows you some respect this time. It's quite a debt of gratitude she owes you.
CHERIE: Mr "Saviour of the Monarchy."
TONY: doubt she'll see it that way.
TONY: Robin. Good to see you.
JANVRIN: Prime Minister.
TONY: ( his most winning smile ) Tony, please..
EQUERRY: The Prime Minister, Ma'am.
ELIZABETH: Do sit down.
TONY: Thank you.
T: It's good to see you again. After quite a summer..
TONY: It's good to see you again. After quite a summer..
TONY: I meant to tell you at the time but you were being monopolised rather.
TONY: I imagine those occasions are quite difficult. Twenty-four heads of Government each clamouring for a private audience..
TONY: Also, we haven't had a chance to speak since THAT week. And I wanted to offer my apologies..
ELIZABETH: Whatever for?
TONY: In case you'd felt `manhandled' or `managed' in any way.
ELIZABETH: Not at all.
ELIZABETH: I don't think I shall ever understand what happened this summer.
TONY: The circumstances were exceptional, Ma'am. And in the end, you showed great personal strength, courage, and humility. E
ELIZABETH: ou're confusing humility with That's not true.
TONY: That's not true.
ELIZABETH: You didn't hear what they were saying in the Mall that Friday.
TONY: I still believe History will show it was a good week for you.
ELIZABETH: And an even better one for you, Mr But there are fifty-two weeks in a year, Ma'am. And two and a half thousand in a half century.
TONY: But there are fifty-two weeks in a year, Ma'am. And two and a half thousand in a half century.
TONY: And when people come to assess your legacy, no one will remember those few You don't feel that what respect or affection people might once have had
ELIZABETH: You don't feel that what respect or affection people might once have had
ELIZABETH: You don't feel that what respect or affection people might once have had
ELIZABETH: ..this institution has been Not at all.
TONY: Not at all.
ELIZABETH: I gather some of your closest advisors were less fulsome in their support..
TONY: One or two. But as a leader one has.a different perspective. I could never have added my voice to the chorus.
ELIZABETH: You're very kind.
ELIZABETH: But let's also not forget the more pragmatic reason.
TONY: Which is?
ELIZABETH: That without me there to distract everyone, it'd suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked power the British Prime Minister actually has.
ELIZABETH: If fifty years of doing MY job has taught me anything, it is that the people doing YOURS generally prefer me with all my faults to some kind of meddling President.. Just look at the French.
TONY: I am.
ELIZABETH: Good. The clocks go back next week, then it'll be dark by five.
ELIZABETH: As a matter of fact, it's how I think best. On my feet. I've never been one for sitting around endlessly. A good walk and fresh air sorts everything Unexpectedly, she stops. And suddenly we realize she's been holding something back..
ELIZABETH: One in four, you said? Wanted to get rid of me? T
TONY: For about half an hour. But then you came down to London and all that went I've never been hated like that No. And that must have been difficult.
ELIZABETH: I've never been hated like that No. And that must have been difficult.
TONY: No. And that must have been difficult.
ELIZABETH: It was. Very.
ELIZABETH: Ever since Diana people want glamour and tears..the grand performance..and I'm not very good at that. I prefer to keep my feelings to myself. Foolishly I believed that's what people wanted from their Queen. Not to make a fuss nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve, duty first. self second.
ELIZABETH: It's how I was brought up. It's all I've ever known
TONY: One forgets. You were so young when you became Queen.
ELIZABETH: I was. A girl.
ELIZABETH: But I can see the world has changed. And one must 'modernise'.
TONY: Well, perhaps that's where I can help.
ELIZABETH: ( with a twinkle as they set off ) Don't get ahead of yourself Prime- minister, I think you'll find that I'm supposed to be advising YOU!
ELIZABETH: So.what might we expect in your first Parliament?
TONY: Well, Ma'am, top of the list is education reform. We want to radically reduce classroom sizes.
