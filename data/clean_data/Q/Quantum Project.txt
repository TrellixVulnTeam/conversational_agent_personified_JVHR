GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS: We are inside a human brain. A pack of neurons FIRE OFF to the left, and rocket their way across synapses to the optic nerve. Passing the eye socket, they speed toward a silky, curvilinear membrane ( the retina ) on which we see an image projected:
VOICE: Professor Pentcho?
ARLETTE: We can start the descent now.
GUIDE: Two hundred feet below us is the world's largest particle accelerator.
PENTCHO: Did you get that data off to Braverman at Cal Tech?
ARLETTE: Next to the elevator, two plants are dying in their pots, their growing lamps off. Pentcho looks around, finds the plug, pushes it into the socket. The lights glow. He peers at a leaf: a tiny bug crawls across.
ARLETTE: We need to progress.
JACQUE: Hey, it is 3-P-O! P, P, P! Professore Paulo Pentcho!
PENTCHO: That's not an official nickname, Jacque.
JACQUE: Beh! Eets just tun-nel humor.
PENTCHO: Did they recalibrate the 3k turn?
JACQUE: Benissimo, Professore.
PENTCHO: Fifteen seconds Arlette.
DOUBLE CLICK: We see an image draw itself on the empty 'page' of the field:
MOUSE CLICK: to the previous 'page' where the LOOP has formed into a sheet moving through space, followed by the floating thought text:
PENTCHO'S VOICE: Ten, nine, eight.
WOMAN: Then goodbye.
FEMALE VOICE: WHAT DO YOU WANT?
TALK!": FEMALE VOICE ( CONT ) ( CONT'D )
JACQUE'S VOICE: Suddenly, we are back inside the pipe, HURTLING toward
WANT, PAUL?": 10 INT. THE AIRPLANE ( PENTCHO ) - DAY 10
VOICE: What the hell were you thinking? What? I want to know! WHAT?!!
PENTCHO: Probability of this happening, same make, model, color and year is less likely than the proof for the existence of God.
WILL: ( seething ) Sorry I asked. ( beat ) You got insurance?
WILL: Up the ramp. Yeah. I'll ( he turns ) There you are! See me? See? They won't let you in? Just walk. Here I am.
SINGER'S VOICE: I know this world is kil.ling you.
WILL: I'll be there, Trent. Yes. 20 minutes
WOMAN: Finished now with the tow truck driver. His head turns. She moves closer. Will's voice protests from the BG.
WILL'S VOICE: ON PENTCHO - SEEING HER, REALLY, FOR THE FIRST TIME 20 INT. PENTCHO'S BRAIN - ( PRESENT DAY MIA ) 20 overlapped by another photograph that slowly comes into focus - top third, middle third, bottom - like a downloading Internet image from his personal files.
MIA: Then goodbye.
PENTCHO: Less likely than the existence of God.
MIA: Day or night?
PENTCHO: Atoms are vibrating, interchanging by the billions. Another voice gets in the way.
WILL'S VOICE: Is that your.
PENTCHO: Is that your.
MIA: No. ( beat ) Not yet.
PENTCHO: Could we go somewhere?
MIA: I'm heading out of town.
PENTCHO: ( deep breath )
MIA: I could go out of town.
PENTCHO: I could go out of town.
MIA: Could you?
PENTCHO: ( nodding ) Where to?
MIA: A place you've never been.
PENTCHO: That's the physicist's playground.
MIA: Why am I doing this?
PENTCHO: It's an experiment.
MIA: We flopped the first time out.
PENTCHO: At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic. They connect in unimaginable ways. And you think this is relevant to our Could be.
MIA: And you think this is relevant to our Could be.
PENTCHO: Could be.
MIA: ( wryly ) What universe are you in, Paul?
PENTCHO: A quantum one. The shorthand is, when you send electrons through space, it's impossible to say precisely what they are: particles or waves.
PENTCHO: The shorthand is, when you send electrons through space, it's impossible to say precisely what they are: particles or waves.
MIA: The Buddhists have been saying that for a
PENTCHO: Mia reaches an electric box, hanging a yard below the ceiling.
MIA: Baby, reality is what you choose to make it.
PENTCHO: WE SEE WHAT HE SEES: A GIANT RENAISSANCE-STYLE FRESCO COVERS THE ENTIRE CEILING. Flocks of ANGELS fly above a GODDESS. Cherubs. Heralds. Pentcho's face flushes. He's exhilarated. She takes note:
MIA: But only if you live your life that way. If you experience every moment as discovery.
PENTCHO: Mia! You're restoring heaven with dabs of paint. You're bringing new order to the
MIA: I always said we were in the same
PENTCHO: If you're right, we have a chance. ( beat ) To be together.
WHOOSH!: In an instant, he's gripping air, FALLING at the speed of Newton's He hurtles downward in slow motion. There's a SOUND rushing in behind him, the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE. Pentcho catches a glimpse up over his shoulder: the angels, the goddess, Mia, all of it has been
PENTCHO: When I was a kid I used to snap my head back like a gunfighter on the draw, hoping to catch a glimpse behind me.
MIA: Of what?
PENTCHO: God. I dunno. The eternal nothingness.
MIA: Welcome, Paul. Welcome.
PENTCHO: An electron spoke to me yesterday. ( beat ) I
MIA: What did it want?
PENTCHO: That's what it asked me. "What do you want?" I didn't answer. I was in the middle of an experiment.
MIA: Like now?
PENTCHO: The firefly dances above them. Pentcho sits up ( and away from her ). Mock serious:
MIA: No. I didn't. ( dryly ) I'm listening.
PENTCHO: Inside every semi-conductor. you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier.
MIA: She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area
PENTCHO: ( plowing ahead ) A five hundred foot thick steel wall. But the connection between these two electrons is so
MIA: That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together
PENTCHO: That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together
MIA: And glow happily ever after.
EMPLOYEE: Rented every last ve-hicle. 'Cept one.
PENTCHO: I'll take it.
ALEXANDER: Paul. Pauly.
PENTCHO: I. I thought you were dead.
ALEXANDER: I must be.
ALEXANDER: Look at me.
PENTCHO: You taking any medication?
ALEXANDER: Don't waste it Pauly. This is not an everyday talk. Just input the information and ask relevant questions. One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me ( pulling the gun out ) to this particular switching station?
PENTCHO: He shoves the shotgun into an open trash can.
ALEXANDER: Two: what if I didn't miss?
PENTCHO: You did.
ALEXANDER: Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in. Results taken. What if I didn't miss?
PENTCHO: You did miss
ALEXANDER: What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor? What then? ( softer ) What did your life mean? ( beat ) Who did you nurture, Pauly? Who did you love?
PENTCHO: Excuse me???
ALEXANDER: What was her name? The one I met.
PENTCHO: He rubs the paint between his fingers.
ALEXANDER: He rubs the paint between his fingers.
PENTCHO: I need some air. ( beat ) Don't shoot me.
ALEXANDER: Standing in the dark.
ALEXANDER: We've been kidding ourselves, Pauly. Until you look for it, it doesn't even exist.
OLD WOMAN: You would have a son with me.
PENTCHO'S VOICE: "If you could look back fast enough, at near to the speed of light, then there would be no reality behind you, because it hadn't yet been created
VOICE: Uncle, hey.
MAGIC MAN: Can you feel it, uncle? Can you feel it right down to your bones?!
PENTCHO: Yes. ( beat ) Yes I can.
WOMAN'S VOICE: What do you want?!
ALEXANDER: Guess who's coming to dinner.
MIA: I didn't want to leave things the way we did. Not this time.
PENTCHO: Wait. I want to tell you something.
MIA: I've been dreaming about this.
PENTCHO: ( excited ) Then you get it. You'll understand.
MIA: His face has the look of the little boy who has just stumbled upon the pirate's treasure.
PENTCHO: I know what I want. I let go, and a second later you materialized at the door. You
MIA: You know those people who won't be photographed because they're afraid you're stealing their souls.? I came to take back my picture. The one I keep leaving with you.
PENTCHO: So I can move on. You too.
MIA: So I can move on. You too.
MIA'S VOICE: I'll drive.
ALEXANDER: Do you want to think about it some more?
WILL: You okay?
PENTCHO'S VOICE: What do you want?
VOICE: Their bodies CONNECT, arms intertwine, lips touch lips.
