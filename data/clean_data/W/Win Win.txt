ABBY: Shit.
ABBY: Mommy, can we play croquet today? Jackie lifts Abby onto the bed.
ABBY (CONT'D): Where's Daddy?
JACKIE: He's running.
ABBY: From what? Jackie smiles.
MIKE: OK. OK. Hi there.
JACKIE: Shit. She looks over at Abby who is immersed in her coloring. Then she sets the food down in front of Stella who is sitting in a high chair. Mike enters wearing a suit and tie.
JACKIE (CONT'D): How was the run?
MIKE JACKIE: Good. It was good. Abby, finish your cereal.
JACKIE (CONT'D): I'm very impressed with you keeping it up. Mike shrugs and takes a yogurt from the refrigerator.
ABBY: I don't like it.
JACKIE: You do too, so stop drawing and eat.
MIKE ABBY: What brand is this? Daddy, look. It's your team.
JACKIE (CONT'D): They're all the same. Mike looks at the drawing. It looks nothing like a team.
MIKE: That's my team? That's great, honey. Are they winning?
ABBY: Yeah.
JACKIE: Maybe you should show the team.
ABBY: Shit.
JACKIE: Honey, you can't use that word. It's a bad word. Off Mike's look.
JACKIE (CONT'D): What? Don't look at me.
MIKE: Uh huh. Bye sweetie. He kisses Abby.
ABBY MIKE: Bye daddy. Bye.
JACKIE: Hey. You OK?
MIKE: Yeah.
JACKIE: You sure?
MIKE: Yeah. I'm good. Why?
JACKIE: Just checking.
MIKE: OK. Bye guy's.
ABBY: Can I have more juice? Mike leaves. Jackie is not convinced.
JACKIE: Just a minute.
JACKIE: Mike? Mike turns. Jackie is standing at the door.
JACKIE (CONT'D): Did you call Fenn about the tree?
PAUL: No. I will today.
JACKIE: Please do. I don't want it coming down on the house. Mike looks at a VERY DEAD TREE in the side yard.
MIKE: Yeah. You're right. I will.
JACKIE: Mike?
MIKE: Yeah?
JACKIE: I love you.
MIKE: I love you too, sweetie. Bye. Jackie shuts the door. Mike looks up at the tree.
MIKE (CONT'D): Shit.
MIKE: Vig?
VOICE: Down here. Mike walks down the stairs.
MIKE: What's up, Vig?
VIGMAN: Donna's out sick and can't find anything without her. It sucks. STEPHEN VIGMAN, FIFTY, emerges carrying some files.
MIKE: Who was that guy?
VIGMAN: Oh, that sucks more. He's the plumber. I called him to look at that piece of crap of boiler. Vigman points to an ANCIENT HOT WATER BOILER.
MIKE: Why?
VIGMAN: That clanking is driving me nuts. Can't you hear it down in your office?
MIKE: Yeah. I just figured it's old.
VIGMAN: Well it is but he took one look at it and said we should replace it before it blows.
MIKE: What?! We just had it fixed three months ago.
VIGMAN: Yeah, he said that job was crap. The guy did crap work. Can you believe that? That little scumbag!
MIKE VIGMAN: Jesus. All they care about is getting paid. Makes me sick. No one wants to do the work anymore.
MIKE: How much to fix it, Vig? Did he say?
VIGMAN: Six grand to replace everything.
MIKE: Holy shit.
VIGMAN: Tell me about it. I gotta be honest, Mike, it's not a good time for me. My business is off and my step son wants to get Lasik.
MIKE: Really? Isn't he too young?
VIGMAN: I don't really care at this point. If it makes him happy, he can have it. I get nothing from that kid.
(MORE): Nothing. He has an unnatural attachment to his father.
MIKE: Right. So what do you want to do?
VIGMAN: Well I was thinking we could leave it for now and just cover the file cabinets in plastic to be safe. How about you?
MIKE: Yeah. I guess I'm good with that. CLANK. CLANK. CLANK. The boiler barks. They both jump.
VIGMAN: Let's get out of here before it blows. I'll pick some up plastic before practice. They both hurry back up the stairs.
MIKE: Hey Shelly, How you doing?
SHELLY: I'm a little hung over and my boyfriend's a moron.
MIKE: Oh. Sorry to hear that.
SHELLY: How'd the team do last night?
MIKE: We lost.
SHELLY: Bummer. Your noon canceled so you just have a 10:30 and 3pm.
MIKE: OK. Anything else?
SHELLY: The toilet isn't flushing again. Should I just call someone this time?
MIKE: No. I'll take a look at it. Who do I have at ten-thirty?
SHELLY: Frank.
MIKE: Great.
MIKE: And you think your son stole it?
FRANK: Yeah. I know he did.
MIKE: Why would he steal your cat, Frank?
FRANK: He's jealous of her. Very jealous.
MIKE: I understand but that's my fee for that particular service. Uh huh. Right. Well maybe I can adjust that a little bit.
MIKE: Well Leo, remember you got lost and the police had to help you a few times. That's why we brought Jolie into help you, right?
LEO: So now what happens?
MIKE: Well if that Judge deems you incapacitated then you will need a guardian. And if we can't find your daughter then the state...
LEO: She can't find herself.
MIKE: OK but if we can't find her then the State will have to become your guardian.
LEO: Who's the state?
MIKE: You know...the state...of New Jersey.
LEO: That's crazy. I don't need New Jersey's help. I got Jolie now. And there's no funny business between us so you know.
MIKE: Right. I'm sure there's not. Let's just first see if we can find your daughter and then we'll go from there.
SHELLY: Am I still hung over or is that noise getting louder?
MIKE: You're probably still hung over. What's that?
SHELLY: Leo's financial statements. He's loaded, huh?
MIKE: Yes, he is. You find his daughter?
SHELLY: No. That lady is gone and doesn't want to be found.
MIKE: Crap. Mike takes the STATEMENTS and puts them in LEO'S FILE.
SHELLY: Can't the state just leave him in his home? That's what the guy wants.
MIKE: They could but they never will. It's too much work. They'll probably move him into Oak Knoll. Hand me one of their brochures? Shelly grabs an OAK KNOLL BROCHURE from a stack.
SHELLY: But he has Jolie now. She can handle it.
MIKE: No, she can't. His guardian still has to make every single decision. It's the difference between a baby sitter and a parent.
SHELLY: I wish I could do it. I could use an extra 1,500 bucks a month.
MIKE: $1,500. Is that what it is?
SHELLY: Yeah. It's in his file. (Answering the phone) Mike Flaherty's office. Mike opens Leo's file.
VIGMAN: Whose singlet is this? What did I say about leaving them around? A WRESTLER runs over and Vig flings it at him.
TERRY: How's the team doing?
MIKE: Not good.
TERRY: What the hell happened? We used to be good.
MIKE: Yeah, well we're not anymore.
TERRY: Can we walk for a bit?
MIKE: Yeah. They both stop. Terry is completely winded.
TERRY: That sucked. You're running good, buddy. Kicking my ass. Terry's blackberry beeps. He takes it out and reads it.
MIKE: Yeah. I've been getting out here a bit more often.
TERRY: You gotta be kidding me.
MIKE: What?
TERRY: Lori's texting me at seven in the morning to ask me if I want an antique sewing table that we bought together.
MIKE: Do you?
TERRY: No. I want my fucking house back!
MIKE: Is she still with that guy?
TERRY: You mean my contractor? The guy I hired? Yeah, she is. I can just picture that little scumbag walking around my house wearing his tool belt. Here. He hands Mike his blackberry.
TERRY (CONT'D): Take a picture for me. Terry pulls down his pants and moons Mike.
TERRY MIKE: Take it! Jesus, Ter!
TERRY (CONT'D): Hurry! It's cold. Mike takes the picture. Terry takes the blackberry back.
MIKE: Don't send it.
TERRY: Too late. I hate her. They start to walk.
MIKE: Maybe you should move back into the city? Get a new job. Shake it up a bit.
TERRY: Nah. Finley called me. He's starting up a new fund out here in May so I'm gonna wait for that.
MIKE: That guy's starting another fund?
TERRY: Yeah. He's an animal. He prints money. Come on, let's finish strong. Terry starts to run. Mike follows. After about thirty feet, Mike pulls up. He's breathing is labored.
MIKE: Hold up!
TERRY: What?
MIKE: Just...hold up. Mike is really breathing hard now. He's making some funny noises.
TERRY: You alright? Mike just holds up a hand. He can't really speak.
TERRY (CONT'D): Holy fuck! Mike? Hang on pal. Terry takes out his black berry but immediately fumbles it into the wet mud.
TERRY (CONT'D): Fuck! Fuck! He grabs it and shakes it out but it's dead.
TERRY (CONT'D): You gotta be kidding me. Shit. Mike is still wheezing. Terry turns his attention.
TERRY (CONT'D): Is it your heart, buddy? Are you having a heart attack?
MIKE: No! I'm not having a heart attack! I just...can't breathe...
TERRY: That could be a heart attack, Mike. You should lie down. Terry tries to help him but it's only seems to annoy Mike.
MIKE TERRY: Get off me! Just lie down.
MIKE: No! It's wet. I don't want to lie down.
TERRY: Who cares? You might be dying. Are you cold? Do you feel cold?
MIKE: Yeah. I'm lying on the ground.
TERRY: Look into my eyes, Mike. Look into my eyes.
TERRY: OK dude, how long has that been happening?
MIKE: Couple of months. The doctor says it's stress.
TERRY: Seriously? Did he prescribe anything for you?
MIKE: Yeah. Jogging. Why the hell you think I'm doing this?
TERRY: Jesus. That scared the shit out of me. What are you so stressed about, Mike?
MIKE: I don't know. Work. Money. Everything.
TERRY: Is it that bad?
MIKE: Yeah. It is. I don't know how much longer I can keep my practice going.
TERRY: Really? Holy shit, Mike! What're you gonna do?
MIKE: I have no frickin' idea. I've been trying everything.
TERRY: Have you told Jackie?
MIKE: Not yet. I don't want to freak her out.
TERRY: Good call. So we just need a new strategy, that's all. What about that Judge that's always throwing work your way? Can't she help you out?
MIKE: Judge Lee, yeah. If it wasn't for her I'd probably be out of business already. I just need more.
TERRY: Is there anything else you can do for money?
MIKE: What the hell am I gonna do? Bartend? I'm a lawyer, Ter. I practice law.
TERRY: Yeah. But that's why he makes it.
MIKE: No shit, Ter. Thanks for the update.
MIKE: Hi, honey. I'm still at the office. Yeah. I came back after practice, I'll be home in a bit. (Checking his blackberry) Oh, hey, let me go, Jack. I've been waiting for this call. Bye. Mike hangs up the phone and answers his blackberry.
MIKE (CONT'D): Hey Tom. Thanks for getting back to me. I'm good. I'm good. Yeah, I was just following up to see if you had any overflow. It's been a slow month on this end and I was... Mike listens. The news from Dunleavy isn't good.
MIKE (CONT'D): Oh. OK. No, yeah of course. I appreciate that. Thanks, Tom. Bye. Mike hangs up the phone and sits at his desk. After a moment, he slams his hand on the desk. And then something catches his eye. It's LEO POPLAR'S FILE. He opens the file and see's the PAMPHLET FOR OAK KNOLL. He flips through the file and lands on a particular page and a particular line item. Monthly Commission: $1,508.00.
MIKE: Hey, Leo. Leo hold on! (to the Guard) Can you stop him, please?
JUDGE LEE: Any word from his daughter? Mr. Flaherty?
MIKE: Oh..no, Your Honor. I have the two certified letters returned unclaimed. And there is no phone number for her. We can't find her.
JUDGE LEE: And she is the only living family, is that correct?
MIKE: Yes, your Honor, she is. But Mr. Poplar hasn't seen her for over twenty years.
LEO: Who?
MIKE: Your daughter.
LEO: She's late? She's probably at the store buying some crap or something.
MIKE: Mike turns back to the Judge and shrugs.
JUDGE LEE: OK, then as, Mr. Poplar has been deemed incapacitated by this court, I'm appointing the Office of Public Guardian to serve as the guardian for his person and property. Do you have the order for me to sign, Mr. Thatcher?
THATCHER: Yes, I do, Your Honor.
JUDGE LEE: Then please approach.
MIKE: Your Honor, if it pleases the Court.
JUDGE LEE: Yes, Mr. Flaherty?
MIKE: I would be willing to serve as Mr. Poplar's guardian.
THATCHER: (Stopping.) Really?
MIKE: Yeah.
THATCHER: How long have you known him? Two weeks? Mike is suddenly put on the spot.
MIKE: More like five.
THATCHER: Really? And now you want to be his guardian? Mike looks at Leo and the Judge.
MIKE: May I approach, your honor?
JUDGE LEE: Council approach. Mike collects himself and approaches.
MIKE: Well Judge, I think I'd be a better candidate then the state in this case.
THATCHER: Really?
MIKE: Yeah, and stop saying really, it's annoying. THE STENOGRAPHER raises in eyebrow.
MIKE (CONT'D): And, as his lawyer, I feel like I'm in a better position to execute what my client wants.
THATCHER: Your Honor, Mr. Flaherty is Mr. Poplar's court appointed attorney...
JUDGE LEE: I know, Stu, I appointed him.
THATCHER: Yeah, well that hardly qualifies him to be Leo's Guardian. What's the motivation here? Thatcher is turning up the heat. He obviously wants Poplar. Mike is starting to feel it.
JUDGE LEE: Mike? Mike looks back at Leo who is trying to unscrew the cap on his water bottle, completely uninterested in the proceedings. He makes a decision.
MIKE: Your Honor, Leo told me he wants to live at home. He has the money to do that and I want to make sure that happens. If the State can do that then fine.
THATCHER: Counsel knows we can't do that, your Honor.
(MORE): We're spread too thin for that kind of individual attention. But they have an excellent elder care facility in Mr. Poplar's town. We'll put him there.
MIKE: Mr. Poplar wants to live at home.
JUDGE MALONE: You can do that, Mike?
MIKE: Yes, I can.
(TO THATCHER): Really. Leo is putting papers in his briefcase. Mike sits down next to him.
LEO: Did we win?
MIKE: Yeah. I think so.
LEO: Good.
LEO: Are we going to the park?
MIKE: No. We're not, Leo. I'm gonna help you get settled into a new place to live right here in town.
LEO: I don't need a new place. I have a house. I'm not fancy that way.
MIKE: I know. But I need you to stay in this new place for a while. It's nice. You'll like it.
LEO: Is that what the judge said?
MIKE: Yeah, that's what he said. Leo considers the news and looks out the window.
LEO: Ah shit.
JACKIE: Let's go, Mr. Mayor. It's cold and I need to pick up some bagels for your mom's.
MIKE: OK. OK. I just have to make one stop first.
JACKIE: Where?
MIKE: I have to swing by a client's house and shut off the water.
JACKIE: Why?
MIKE: Because it's freezing and I don't want his pipes to burst.
JACKIE: No, I mean why are you doing it?
MIKE: What? Oh, because I'm his guardian.
JACKIE: What? Since when?
MIKE ABBY: Just last week. Mommy, I want a bagel.
JACKIE (CONT'D): That's a big deal, Mike. Were you even gonna tell me?
MIKE JACKIE: It's not a big deal. And yes, It is too. I was gonna tell you.
JACKIE (CONT'D): You don't have time to be taking care of some old man.
MIKE: Jack, he's in Oak Knoll. They do everything. I just have to check in on him from time to time.
JACKIE: And who pays for that?
MIKE: He does. It comes out of his estate and he can afford it. Trust me.
JACKIE: I don't get it. You've never done it before.
MIKE: No I haven't.
JACKIE: So why are you doing it now?
MIKE: It's just...the right thing to do, alright. We couldn't find his daughter and I'm just trying to help the guy. It's really not a big deal.
JACKIE: Well, it sounds like a big deal. And you should have told me.
ABBY: What's a big deal?
JACKIE: Ask your daddy, sweetie. Maybe he'll tell you.
ABBY: Daddy, what's a big deal?
JACKIE: Is that his house?
MIKE: Yeah.
JACKIE: (Re: the Young Man) Who's that?
MIKE: No idea. Mike gets out of the car.
MIKE: How you doing? Can I help you?
YOUNG MAN: No.
MIKE: Are you looking for Mr. Poplar?
YOUNG MAN: Yeah.
MIKE: Well, he doesn't live here anymore.
YOUNG MAN: Where does he live?
MIKE: You mind telling me why you're looking for him first? The Young Man sizes Mike up. Then...
YOUNG MAN: He's my Grandfather. I came to live with him. Mike is momentarily stunned by the news. Then he looks back at the car where Jackie gives him a "What's going on?" look. Uh oh.
JACKIE: So do you live around here, Kyle?
KYLE: No. Ohio. Jackie looks at Mike who tries to avoid her piercing gaze.
JACKIE: Ohio? And where are your parents?
KYLE: It's just my mother and me. She's back in Columbus. She couldn't come.
JACKIE: So how did you get here?
KYLE: Bus.
JACKIE: Really? All by yourself?
KYLE: Yeah.
JACKIE: Wow.
ABBY: That sounds like a big deal. Jackie looks at Mike. From the mouths of babes.
MIKE: Hey, Leo, you have a visitor.
LEO: Who? Him?
MIKE: Yeah.
KYLE: Hi.
LEO: Come on in. I'll turn off the TV.
MIKE: This is Kyle Timmons, Leo. He's your grandson. He came from Ohio to see you.
LEO: I don't have a Grandson.
KYLE: Yeah, you do. We just never met.
LEO: Are you bringing me home? Kyle looks to Mike, unsure of what to say.
MIKE: Kyle's just here for a visit, Leo.
LEO: Oh. You want to watch TV?
KYLE: Leo turns on the TV and sits down. Kyle joins him.
MIKE: OK. So I'll come back to pick you up in an hour. You OK?
KYLE: Yeah.
MIKE: You alright, Leo? (Leo doesn't respond) OK, see you in a bit.
GINA: So did you call his mother?
JACKIE: No. Not yet. Oh and he was smoking too. He's sixteen!
GINA: He's probably on drugs.
JACKIE: I know.
GINA: What are you going to do with him?
MIKE: We're going to send him back is what we're going to do.
GINA: Well I hope so. You have your hands full over there. And now taking care of that old man too. That sounds like a lot, Mike.
JACKIE: Thank you, Gina. I agree. He somehow forgot to tell me about it.
MIKE: I told you.
JACKIE: Not until I asked.
GINA: His daughter should be taking care of him. Not you. You have me to worry about.
MIKE: I don't have to worry about him. He's at Oak Knoll.
ABBY: Daddy? Can we play croquet today?
GINA: The whole thing just sounds crazy.
JACKIE: It is crazy. It's crazy.
ABBY: Who's crazy?
MIKE: Me.
MIKE: How did the visit go?
KYLE: OK. He fell asleep watching TV. So he lives there now?
MIKE: Yeah. Your grandfather is in the early stages of dementia, Kyle. So sometimes he does things and says things that don't make sense.
KYLE: Are you a friend of his or something?
MIKE: I'm his guardian.
KYLE: What's that mean?
MIKE: It means I make sure he's well taken care of.
KYLE: That's cool. Kyle lights a cigarette.
JACKIE: Everything alright?
KYLE: Yeah.
JACKIE: Did you reach your mom?
KYLE: Yeah. I told her I was coming home.
JACKIE: Did she want to talk to me or anything?
KYLE: No.
JACKIE: Well, I'm sorry you can't stay longer but maybe you can come back with your mom and visit again.
KYLE: Yeah. If I want to smoke should I go outside?
JACKIE: You shouldn't be smoking.
KYLE: I know. But if I do. Jackie decides not to engage.
JACKIE: Yeah. You should go outside.
KYLE: OK. Good night, Jackie.
JACKIE: Good night, Kyle. Jackie nods and leaves.
MIKE: What are you doing?
JACKIE: We have kids, Mike. I'm not taking any chances with Eminem down there.
MIKE: There's not even a bathroom down there. Jackie thinks about this and then unlocks the door in a huff and walks up stairs.
LEO: Hey Mike, could you talk to them about getting Coco Puffs? I like that kind.
MIKE: Sure thing, Leo.
LEO: Mike's a stand up guy. You need cereal then talk to him. Kyle and Mike smile. Mike checks his watch.
MIKE: We should go, Kyle.
KYLE: OK. Bye Leo.
LEO: Are you going to work?
KYLE: No. I'm going home.
LEO: Well, don't take any shit from any of those guys. Kyle smiles. He doesn't always understand this guy but he likes him.
KYLE: I won't. He leaves.
MIKE: Here's fifty bucks in case you need it. Mike counts his cash.
KYLE: I have money.
MIKE: Actually it's only forty-three but take it. You never know.
KYLE: I have enough money. But thanks. The bus pulls up.
MIKE: Well, good luck, Kyle.
KYLE: Yeah. You too, Mike. Kyle gets on the bus. Mike watches it pull away.
MIKE: Hello? Yes, it is. Yes. OK.
MIKE (CONT'D): OK. Thanks. I'll be right down. He hangs up the phone.
JACKIE: What?
MIKE: It was the police. They have Kyle.
JACKIE: What? Why?
MIKE: Breaking and entering. Mike gets up.
JACKIE: What?
MIKE: So what happened?
KYLE: I decided not to go home.
MIKE: And then you decided you'd break into your Grandfather's house?
KYLE: You mind if I have a quick smoke?
MIKE: Yeah, I do. Get in the car.
MIKE: So you want to tell me what happened?
KYLE: Not really.
MIKE: Yeah. Well good luck with that, pal. Kyle looks at Mike.
MIKE (CONT'D): You'll see.
JACKIE: Kyle? Kyle can barely look at her.
JACKIE (CONT'D): We can't help you if you don't tell us what's going on. Is there a reason you don't want to go home? Kyle remains silent.
JACKIE (CONT'D): What happened to your eye, Kyle? Kyle shifts. Avoiding.
JACKIE (CONT'D): Kyle. You can trust us. Kyle looks up at them. Trust is obviously an issue.
KYLE: I can't live there anymore.
JACKIE: With your Mom? Did she do that to your eye?
KYLE: No. She's not even there. She's in a clinic or hospital or whatever. I'm living with Craig.
JACKIE: Who's Craig?
KYLE: Her boyfriend, I guess, but he's an asshole.
JACKIE: Does she even know you're here?
KYLE: My mom? She doesn't care about me.
JACKIE: How do you know? She's probably worried sick and just doesn't know how to reach you. Kyle reaches into his pocket and takes out his cell phone.
KYLE: She could've called, right? The sincerity of his question is heartbreaking and Jackie is cut to the quick. She looks at Mike. Brutal.
MIKE: So what are we gonna do? Adopt him? Jackie walks into the room putting on face moisturizer.
JACKIE: No. But I'm not sending him back until I talk to his mother. She better freaking call me back.
MIKE: Honey, I know it's tough but we're not in a position to take care of another kid right now. She gets in the bed.
JACKIE: I don't care. I'm not sending him back there, Mike. I can't. And for the record, I'm not very happy about it either!
MIKE: Then we don't have to do this.
JACKIE: Yes, we do, Mike! We do. It makes me so angry and so damn sad to see that poor kid in that kind of situation. He's just a kid. Jackie starts to break. Mike buckles.
MIKE: I know. I know. You're right.
JACKIE: I just want to go to Ohio and...beat the crap out of his mom.
MIKE: Come on.
JACKIE: I do. I want to beat the crap out of her and her stupid boyfriend.
JACKIE: I'm serious.
MIKE: I know. I'm just not sure that beating the crap out of everybody is the best solution.
JACKIE: Well it feels like it. I'm leaving her another message. Jackie picks up her phone and dials.
MIKE: Now?
JACKIE: Yes. Now. Shush!
TERRY: Have you talked to his mother?
MIKE: No. Not yet. Jack's left her about thirty messages. A STRAPPING CONTRACTOR wearing a TOOL BELT gets out and walks into the house.
TERRY: Mother fucker. He's wearing his tool belt.
TERRY: No. Sorry dude, I was distracted.
TERRY: It's my fucking house and no. I'm just driving. Where's the kid now?
MIKE: He's sitting in my waiting room. Jackie made me take him with me.
MIKE: No. What does that mean?
TERRY: It means you shouldn't be taking care of another kid. Especially a convict.
MIKE: Yeah, well... Shelly pops her head in.
SHELLY: I found her. Mike spins in his chair.
MIKE: Let me call you back.
SHELLY: She's in a drug treatment program in Columbus. She has five weeks to go.
MIKE: Jesus. Can I talk to her?
SHELLY: They said she would call you. Mike shakes his head. Nothing is easy here.
SHELLY (CONT'D): He's kind of a sweet kid but what's up with hair?
MIKE: Who knows? A knock on the door.
MIKE (CONT'D): Yeah. Kyle opens it.
KYLE: Can I go visit Leo? Mike looks to Shelly who just shrugs.
MIKE: Uh...yeah...OK. You know where it is?
KYLE: Yeah. Just down the street.
MIKE: OK, yeah. Just stay there and I'll pick you up at about three.
KYLE: Kyle shuts the door. Mike looks at Shelly.
SHELLY: That's some crazy hair, I'm just saying.
MIKE: Hey, Rew, what are you doing? Coach, can you get on Pill.
VIGMAN: Get up, Rew. REW gets up and Vigman gets down on the other wrestler, PILL.
MIKE: Everyone watch because none of you are doing it right. You want to put your chest into his side. Vig does it but he's a bit off.
MIKE (CONT'D): Just slide back a bit, Vig. A bit more. Yeah. Right there. Then you give him your full weight. Go ahead Vig. Vig does. Pill starts to buckle. Vig is big.
MIKE (CONT'D): Then you ride the crotch and break him down with a cross-face. Vigman grabs Pill under the crotch, applies a stiff cross- face and then drives him hard to the mat. Another Wrestler, STEMLER chimes in. Stemler is wearing a STAR WARS t-shirt.
STEMLER: Oh man, how'd that feel, Pill? We'll just call you "pancake"! Stemler's a bit off.
PILL: Shut up, Chewbaka.
STEMLER: Yeah, right. More like the "Secret Apprentice".
FEENEY: What are you, ten years old, Stemler? Mike loses it.
MIKE: Hey! We're trying to teach you guys something and you're all just goofing off. Shut up!
VIG: Quiet!
MIKE: Last time I checked we haven't won a match! Right coach?!
VIG: It's embarrassing, guys.
MIKE: It's embarrassing. But you're all acting like you don't care! Well, I'm not getting paid enough to just jerk around here. (gestures to Vig) I don't know about you?
VIG: I'm not getting paid enough.
MIKE: I care about what I do and so should you!
VIG: I care!
MIKE: So does coach Vig, and so should you! Run em, Coach. I can't look at them anymore!
VIG: Let's go ladies! Mike storms out past Kyle who watches him go.
JACKIE: Here, have some more corn. She gives him the bowl of corn.
JACKIE (CONT'D): I'll get you some more milk too. Kyle finishes off the corn. Jackie gets up for the milk.
JACKIE (CONT'D): Did you call Fenn about the tree, Mike?
MIKE: Uh...yeah I did but Terry said he'd help and I think we can...
JACKIE: Mike. Don't start. You two are not cutting down that tree. Just call Fenn. Stella starts to cry on the BABY MONITOR.
JACKIE (CONT'D): I'm going to give her some Tylenol. And Jackie is gone.
ABBY: Do you want to play croquet?
KYLE: Now?
ABBY: When it's warm.
KYLE: Yeah, maybe. Mike gets up and begins to load the dishwasher.
ABBY: Daddy, can I watch TV?
MIKE: Uh...yeah but just for a half hour. Abby leaves. Kyle turns to Mike.
KYLE: Hey Mike, you think I could practice with you guys tomorrow?
MIKE: Yeah, if you want. Sure. And by the way, what I did in there today, yelling like that. I don't usually do that.
KYLE: You were right, they deserved it.
KYLE: I don't have wrestling shoes.
MIKE: Don't worry about it. You ever wrestle before?
KYLE: Yeah. Vigman is already running the team through a drill.
VIGMAN: Get that ankle. Get that ankle! Time!
MIKE: Hey Vig. Alright, guys, listen up! Kyle's going to be working out with us for a little while.
STEMLER: What's up Kyle! The team laughs. Kyle just nods to Stemler.
VIGMAN: Carlos, you and Jimmy rotate him in. Kyle nods and walks over to Carlos and Jimmy.
VIGMAN (CONT'D): OK. Let's go. Ten seconds to get an ankle. Then we switch it up. Ready? Wrestle! Jimmy sits against the wall and Mike blows his whistle again the wrestlers all go at each other. Mike watches Kyle. He moves well. Fluidly. Carlos keeps trying to grab Kyle's ankle but Kyle easily defends against it. Mike checks his watch. Then blows his whistle.
MIKE: Time. Switch. And...wrestle!
MIKE: You have fun?
KYLE: Yeah.
MIKE: When's the last time you wrestled?
KYLE: A couple years ago.
MIKE: Why'd you stop?
KYLE: Just felt like it. Kyle just shrugs and Mike let's it go. They arrive at Mike's car and Mike talks to Kyle over the roof.
MIKE: So let me ask you something, Kyle. How good are you? Kyle just looks at Mike, almost blank.
KYLE: I'm pretty good.
MIKE: Holy shit.
TERRY: Holy shit!
MIKE: I know, right? Can you believe that?! Terry is in the den at his computer, reading excitedly.
TERRY: Holy shit! He was thirty-five and one as a freshman!
MIKE: I know. He finished second at the states. In Ohio! Mike walks into the kitchen and grabs a beer.
TERRY: This kid had seventeen pins. He's a killer.
MIKE: I know. It's nuts. And he quit after his freshman year.
TERRY: Why?
MIKE: I don't know. He doesn't talk much. He's kind of a weird kid. Why can't I have one kid like that on my team? Just one.
TERRY: What're you talking about? You do. You have him. You can take this kid to the states, Mike.
MIKE: He's not on the team, Ter. He's not even a student. He's been here for three days.
TERRY: So what? Enroll him!
MIKE: I'm not enrolling him. He's just here until we reach his mother and figure this out.
TERRY: So he's gotta do something, right? Let him wrestle. Look at this way, you're helping out the old man and this kid's a little bonus for doing the right thing.
MIKE: I'm not just helping out the old man, Ter. It's not like it's charity work. I'm getting paid for it.
TERRY: No. Shit, everyone gets paid, but think about it, Mike. What are the chances that this kid ends up on your door step and he can wrestle like that? It's a sign, pal. This lands with Mike. Terry sits down at his computer.
TERRY (CONT'D): Check this out. There's a video link of him wrestling in some tournament. Terry presses play. It's grainy and amateur but good enough. Mike looks on.
TERRY (CONT'D): Look at that kid. Mike gets sucked in.
MIKE: Wow. He's gonna throw him. Look, he's setting him up. He's setting him up! Mike and Terry explode. They high five and hug.
JACKIE: Here's five dollars for lunch. I have no idea what it costs but let me know when you find out.
KYLE: I have money.
JACKIE: Good for you. Save it. Now take this, it's too early to argue. Kyle takes it. Mike arrives.
MIKE: OK. Let's go, pal.
JACKIE: Bye Jackie. Kyle leaves. Mike kisses Jackie.
JACKIE (CONT'D): Hey, you sure we should do this?
MIKE: Why not? Whether he's here for two more days or two weeks it gives him something to do all day. Unless you want him hanging out here?
JACKIE: OK. Go.
SHELLY: Hey Mike, we got a check from Leo Poplar's trust for $1,500 but it's made out to you and not the firm.
MIKE: Right. I'll take that. Mike gets up and takes the check.
SHELLY: Shouldn't I deposit it in the business account?
MIKE: No. It's not a legal fee. It's a personal fee.
SHELLY: For what? He puts on his coat.
MIKE: Oh, I ended up taking on Leo's guardianship.
SHELLY: Really?
MIKE: Yeah, I thought I mentioned that to you.
SHELLY: No, you definitely didn't mention that.
MIKE: Yeah, well, it just played out that way. I have to get going. He turns off his computer.
SHELLY: Well can we put some of that in the business account so they don't take our copier back?
MIKE: Uh..not this time. Next month. Promise. He grabs his briefcase and leaves.
SHELLY: We need our copier, Mike.
MIKE: I know. Bye Shelly.
SHELLY: And that noise is getting louder. I'm not hung over today!
MIKE: Hey honey. I'm good. Could you do me a favor and drop that health insurance check in the mail? I just forgot to mail it. Yeah, it's on my desk. Thanks. I'll call you later.
TERRY: What's up Fella's? Hitting the showers, huh?
(TO HIMSELF): That sounded weird.
TERRY: Oh yeah!
MIKE: Hey.
TERRY: What's up? Hey Vig.
VIGMAN: Hi Terry.
MIKE: What are you doing here?
TERRY: What do you think? I have to see this kid.
VIGMAN: He's incredible. Just incredible. And he's good to wrestle.
TERRY: Great. So what's next? Terry pulls up a stool.
MIKE: We're trying to figure out where he can wrestle?
TERRY: Where ever the hell he wants, right?
MIKE: No. Not right. Kyle knocks at the door.
MIKE (CONT'D): Hey Kyle. Come on in. How was school?
MIKE: This is my friend Terry. Terry, pops up, a bit too excitedly.
TERRY: Hey man! Nice to meet you! Really nice to meet you. Welcome.
KYLE: Thanks.
MIKE: How the shoe's fit?
KYLE: Good.
MIKE: So let me ask you something, Kyle. You think you might want to wrestle in a match?
MIKE: Great. We have a match on Saturday. What do you wrestle?
KYLE: One-nineteen.
TERRY: Excellent. Done.
KYLE: Is anyone there now?
MIKE: Yeah. Jimmy Reed. But I think he might be better off at 125.
KYLE: Don't you think we should wrestle off?
VIGMAN: Alright, let's go guys. Wrestle off.
MIKE: Vig, you keep time?
VIGMAN: Yeah.
TERRY: I'll do it. Terry grabs the watch from Mike.
TERRY (CONT'D): You don't mind, do you?
VIGMAN: No. Go ahead. Mike gives Terry a look. Vig minds. Kyle and JIMMY REED shake hands. And set themselves on their marks.
VIGMAN (CONT'D): Ready? And...wrestle. Vigman blows his whistle and the room erupts in cheering. Most of it for Jimmy Reed except for Stemler who is rooting for Kyle. Jimmy and Kyle lock arms but Kyle pushes him away. Jimmy locks again but Kyle pushes him away again. Jimmy comes in hard this time and Kyle uses his momentum to quickly throw him to the ground. Jimmy tries to scramble to his knees but Kyle is all over him. He quickly locks Jimmy in a cradle and rocks him onto his back. It looks easy. Vigman calls the pin. The room is quiet...except for Terry.
TERRY: Wow! Mike shoots Terry a look. Kyle helps Jimmy off the mat.
KYLE: Good match.
JIMMY: Didn't feel good. Vigman turns to Mike and Terry.
VIGMAN: I don't think we can teach him anything.
TERRY: I don't know why we didn't quit. Just the smell of that room brought back the memories. I hated it, it was like a form of self-abuse.
KYLE: Were you guys that bad?
TERRY: Mike was average. I sucked. Sorry Abby.
ABBY: It's OK. Mike checks his watch.
MIKE: I gotta stop by the office and deal with the computer. Should I...?
JACKIE: No, I'll take him.
TERRY: We both should have quit. Then we could have joined the ski club and gotten busy with Allison Shepard on the overnights.
MIKE JACKIE: Hey! Yo! Terry!
ABBY: Who was busy?
JACKIE: Your Uncle Terry is just silly.
TERRY: Sorry Abby. Getting busy is bad. Kyle cracks up. Terry catches his eye.
KYLE: Hey, how do you think we'd do against Kyle? Now?
TERRY: Yeah, you're right. The kid has man strength, dude. Mike emerges from under the desk.
MIKE: Man strength?
TERRY: Yeah. You know. Not kid strength. Man strength.
MIKE: Yeah...I wouldn't say that around the locker room.
TERRY: What the hell are you doing anyway?
MIKE: Trying to figure out what's wrong with my fricking back-up system.
TERRY: Just call your IT guy?
MIKE: I don't have an IT guy. IT guys cost money.
TERRY: OK. I'm just gonna say what's on my mind. I want to be an assistant coach too.
MIKE: Seriously?
TERRY: Yeah. Why not? I'm value added. Especially compared to Vig.
MIKE: How are you value added?
TERRY: Well first of all I'm fun. No denying that. And secondly, unlike Vig, I actually used to wrestle.
MIKE: Yeah, but Ter, you sucked.
TERRY: That doesn't matter, your team sucks. Plus I even look more like a coach then Vig.
MIKE: Yeah, that's not really value added.
TERRY: Look, Mike, I'm serious here. I need some distraction in my life right now. All I do is sit in my condo and think about Lori and that guy having sex in the jacuzzi I paid for. It's fucking unhealthy. I've been really kind of going crazy. Really. Mike looks at his friend. He can tell he's serious.
MIKE: We start at 3:30pm. Don't be late.
TERRY: My brother! I will not let you down. To the team. Terry raises his glass. Mike toasts.
TERRY (CONT'D): Hey, what should I wear to practice?
MIKE: Just a singlet.
TERRY: Really?
MIKE: Yeah, so we can see your man strength.
TERRY: Good one, Coach! See, it's already fun.
JACKIE: Hello? Hello, this Jackie Flaherty. Kyle is staying with us. Hello? (She closes the phone) I'm gonna kill that lady. She sets the phone down and turns. Kyle is standing on the stairs. His hair is wet and he's carrying his towel.
JACKIE (CONT'D): Oh. Hi. I heard your phone ringing and...
KYLE: You answered it?
JACKIE: Yeah, well, I saw it was your Mom and we've been waiting to hear from her.
KYLE: What'd she say?
JACKIE: She didn't say anything. She hung up. Have you talked to her?
KYLE: No. Can you not answer my phone anymore?
JACKIE: Yeah. OK. I can do that. I'm sorry.
JACKIE (CONT'D): Oh. Here's a bucket. You shouldn't be smoking but if you do could you put the cigarettes in here.
KYLE: I quit now that I'm wrestling
JACKIE: Oh. Good. OK. She leaves. Kyle walks over the couch and picks up his phone.
JACKIE: Is that Abby?
MIKE: If it is, she just ran away.
MIKE: Were you outside?
KYLE: Yeah. I went for a run.
MIKE: It's pretty early. You do this every morning?
KYLE: In season, yeah. I like to get my run in early and then drill some moves for an hour before school.
MIKE: Oh. Wow.
KYLE: Yeah...so I'm gonna do it. See you.
MIKE: It was Kyle.
JACKIE: What's he doing?
MIKE: Working out.
JACKIE: Is he gonna do it every morning?
MIKE: In season. Yeah. Beat.
JACKIE: I hate you.
MIKE: I know.
VIGMAN: Jesus! Look at those tats.
TERRY: This kid is just fricking cool.
REF: Timmons. One nineteen. Good.
TERRY: This song sucks.
VIGMAN: Rew picked it. He's an odd one.
TERRY: Hey Vig, which kid is yours anyway?
VIGMAN: None of them. He quit.
TERRY: Really? You're son quit?
VIGMAN: My step son and yes. Don't get me started, I thought becoming a coach might be a nice way for us to bond. He said it wasn't fierce and he quit.
TERRY: Harsh. So why you still doing it?
MIKE: Vig is leading by example. Winners never quit.
VIGMAN: That's right, even if it sucks. This team is just depressing sometimes. Terry sits next to Mike.
VIGMAN (CONT'D): That's where I sit, Ter.
TERRY: Sorry buddy. I got to be near, Mike. It's good luck.
VIGMAN: Say's who?
MIKE: Guys. I don't think we should fight about our seats in front of the kids.
MIKE: OK. You ready?
KYLE: Yeah.
MIKE: This kid is good. So just...you know...be ready out there. Terry gives Vigman a look. "Be ready?"
KYLE: Can you give me a slap?
MIKE: What?
KYLE: Give me a slap. Across the face. Like your waking me up.
MIKE: Uh, OK. Mike cuffs Kyle on the side of the head gear.
KYLE: Can you do it harder? Mike slaps him hard. And Kyle sprints to the mat and takes his stance. The Ref blows the whistle and the wrestlers circle each other. The OTHER WRESTLER is clearly on the offensive.
TERRY: Come on, Kyle. Take this punk out.
MIKE: (Under his breath) Ter! Cut the shit! You're a coach. You're not sitting in the stands.
TERRY: Sorry. I'm just excited. You know me. The Other Wrestler shoots a single and takes Kyle down. Two points.
TERRY (CONT'D): What's he doing?
VIGMAN: Losing.
MIKE: It's his first match. Give him a break. The Other Wrestler is relentless. Kyle keeps trying to get up and the kid keeps breaking him down. Kyle stands up and Other Wrestler slams him to the mat. Kyle is getting beat up. The two Wrestlers go out of bounds and the Ref stops the action. Kyle gets up and Mike checks in with him.
MIKE (CONT'D): Hey! You OK?
KYLE: Yeah. Kyle gets into the bottom position.
VIGMAN: Did he smile?
MIKE: Yeah. I think he did.
TERRY: Good. That's good, right? The Ref blows the whistle and Kyle explodes to his feet, kicking a leg back between the Other Wrestler's legs. He lower's his body, reaches behind him and whips the Other Wrestler to the mat.
TERRY (CONT'D): See. I'm good luck.
VIGMAN: That's got nothing to do with luck. Kyle shakes the other wrestler's hands and the Ref raises his hand in victory. Kyle crosses to the opposing coaches and shakes their hands. Then he runs to back to his bench. Mike greets him with a handshake.
MIKE: How'd that feel? Pretty good?
KYLE: Yeah, pretty good. Mike smiles and Kyle sits down. The next wrestler, Jimmy steps up to Mike.
MIKE: You ready?
JIMMY: Yeah. Can you slap me too, Coach? Mike laughs. And then he slaps him.
JACKIE: I'm going to the market. I'll be back in a bit.
KYLE: Can I go with you?
JACKIE: Uh...yeah OK. Kyle gets up to get his coat. Jackie looks at Mike who just shrugs.
ABBY: I want to go with Kyle.
MIKE: No, honey. It's almost bed time.
JACKIE: Coco Puffs. Is that your brand?
KYLE: It's for Leo.
JACKIE: Nice. Drop it in, it's on me. Go ahead.
(KYLE DOES): How's he doing?
KYLE: He's doing OK. He can say some pretty funny things. Yesterday he told me I was fired.
JACKIE: Fired? For what?
KYLE: I don't know. He just fired me.
JACKIE: I think I have to meet this Leo.
KYLE: Yeah. He's a pretty funny dude.
JACKIE: You have any home work?
KYLE: A little but I already did it.
JACKIE: Impressive. You ever think about going to college?
KYLE: Yeah but just to wrestle. My old coach thought I could get a scholarship.
JACKIE: Yeah, I hear you're pretty good. So why'd you quit? Kyle just shrugs.
JACKIE (CONT'D): You don't have to tell me. It's alright. They keep walking. Jackie grabs a box of tacos from the shelf.
JACKIE (CONT'D): Do you like tacos?
KYLE: Yeah.
JACKIE: Me, too. I make a mean taco.
VIGMAN: Let's go! Circle up!
MIKE: Alright. I want to spend this week working on bottom position. Did you all see Kyle the other day? He exploded up. Kyle, show the guys what you did. Kyle is caught off guard. He hesitates
KYLE: It's kind of my own thing.
MIKE: So can you share it with us?
KYLE: Well, it's not a move or anything, I just tell myself that the guy on top is going to take my head and shove it under water and kill me. And if I don't want to die on the bottom, I just gotta do what ever the fuck it takes to get out. This kid is intense. His words really land with Mike.
VIGMAN: OK. So the move is called "whatever the fuck it takes." Let's go. Let's work on it. Come on. "Whatever the fuck it takes." Vigman claps and the wrestlers start to move.
LEO: You're mother didn't want to come?
KYLE: No.
LEO: She's a tough kid that one. She tell you bad things about me?
KYLE: Yeah. But I never believe her anyway.
LEO: You should, she's your mother. Respect that. (Pointng to the TV) Can you turn that down? I hate that judge. I wouldn't be in this place if it wasn't for her.
KYLE: But this place is pretty nice.
LEO: It's not my damn house! I paid for that house. Damn Judge. Turn it off!
KYLE: You want to take a walk outside, Leo?
LEO: Yeah. Let's go to my park.
KYLE: Your park, huh?
LEO: Yeah. My park.
MIKE: You bring the tape?
KYLE: Yeah. It's in my bag. Mike grabs his briefcase from the trunk.
KYLE (CONT'D): Hey, Mike, can I ask you something?
MIKE: Yeah. Of course. What?
KYLE: Leo told me that some Judge made him move into that place. Is that true or is he just making that up? Mike wasn't expecting this.
MIKE: No. That's true, pal.
KYLE: Why?
MIKE: Well because they can take good care of him there, Kyle. Mike's phone rings.
KYLE: But he wants to live at home.
MIKE: I know, pal. Hang on a minute. (Into cell phone) Hello? Yes. This is him.
MIKE (CONT'D): Oh. Can you hang for a moment?
(TO KYLE): Hey, I have to take this. I'll be right in, OK? We can talk in a minute. Kyle walks inside. Mike watches him go, already regretting the lie. He exhales...
MIKE (CONT'D): Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting. Yeah. How are you doing?
JACKIE: What? She doesn't even know us!
MIKE: Yeah, well I think she heard that I'm a lawyer and I have a family and that was good enough.
JACKIE: For how long?
MIKE: Another month, I guess, until she gets out of rehab. She said that Craig guy took off. She sounded pretty shaky.
JACKIE: I can't believe this lady. Jackie joins Mike at the table.
MIKE: Yeah. I know. Where is he anyway?
JACKIE: In the basement with Abby.
(BEAT): This is crazy.
MIKE: Yes, it is. So what do we do?
JACKIE: We let him stay. I don't know, do we even have a choice?
MIKE: I guess we don't.
STEMLER: You nervous?
KYLE: No.
STEMLER: I am.
KYLE: You're not wrestling.
STEMLER: I know. I'm just nervous a lot.
KYLE: You ever think about wrestling in a match?
STEMLER: Yeah. I'm just waiting for the green light from Coach. But I'm glad I'm not wrestling today. These guys are ranked fourth in the state. And you're wrestling Kenny Randall. He's undefeated. He is tough! Really tough.
KYLE: Thanks for letting me know. Vigman stands up at the front of the bus.
VIGMAN: Hey! Cut the chatter! You should all be playing the "what if" game. What if he shoots a single leg? What if he controls my wrists?
STEMLER: What if we all get pinned like last year?
VIGMAN: Shut up, Stemler! Or I'll throw you off the bus myself! Vigman sits back down next to Terry.
TERRY: Did they really pin all of you?
VIGMAN: Just about. It's gonna be a fucking bloodbath.
MIKE: OK. This is Kenny Randall. He's very good.
KYLE: Yeah, I heard.
MIKE: But you have an advantage here, he has no idea who you are, right?
(MORE): So he's gonna be overconfident. You take advantage of that and when you get your shot, put him away. Kyle nods and Mike slaps him across the face and Kyle sprints to his place on the mat and gets ready. Mike turns to the team.
MIKE (CONT'D): See how he runs out there? I want that kind of intensity from all of you.
ABBY: Why did Daddy hit Kyle?
JACKIE: I don't know, honey. The Ref blows the whistle and the match starts. As Mike predicted KENNY RANDALL tries to end the match quickly with a throw but Kyle is too strong and too good. Kyle counters and throws Kenny to his back. Before anyone can blink, Kyle pins him. Mike, Terry, and Vigman explode off their chairs.
VIGMAN: He just pinned Kenny Randall. Are you kidding me?! Kenny Randall looks shocked. He throws off his head gear and gets up. The MILBURN COACHES look equally shocked. The Ref raises Kyle's hands. Kyle runs over to shake the Milburn Coaches hand and then he runs back to his bench and is greeted by Mike.
KYLE: He know's who I am now. Mike smiles as the team greets him.
KYLE: Hi, can I watch TV in here?
JACKIE: Yeah but I want to show you something. Stella, who's that?
STELLA: Ky. Kyle laughs.
JACKIE: She started saying it at the match today.
KYLE: That's cool.
JACKIE: OK. So I have to ask, those tatoo's must have hurt, right?
KYLE: Not really.
JACKIE: Don't lie to me. Look. Jackie lifts her pant leg. She has a small tatoo on her ankle.
JACKIE (CONT'D): I got it on Spring Break. Hurt like hell.
KYLE: What's it say?
JACKIE: JBJ. Jon Bon Jovi. I'm a fan. You got a problem with that?
KYLE: No I do not.
JACKIE: That was fun today. You're good. I'm glad you started wrestling again.
KYLE: Yeah. Me too.
JACKIE: No quitting this time, you got that?
KYLE: Can I tell you something?
JACKIE: Of course.
KYLE: I didn't quit my old team. I got thrown off.
JACKIE: Why?
KYLE: I stole a car.
JACKIE: What? You're don't even drive.
KYLE: Yeah. That was part of the problem.
JACKIE: Who's car did you steal?
KYLE: A teacher's.
JACKIE: Oh my God.
KYLE: It was really stupid.
JACKIE: Yeah. It was stupid. You could have killed yourself.
KYLE: Yeah. Everything just got messed up after that.
JACKIE: Yeah, well we all do stupid things. But the best part is that you got a another chance and now you're kicking butt.
KYLE: I guess.
JACKIE: It's true. And you know who would agree with me?
KYLE: Mike? Jackie lifts her leg.
JACKIE: Nope. JBJ. Jackie lifts her leg exposing her tatoo. Kyle smiles.
VIGMAN: They don't have anyone at heavyweight.
MIKE: Really? Korsic will be happy. Tell him now so he doesn't puke.
TERRY: Why does he puke? He's a heavyweight. He doesn't have to lose weight.
VIGMAN: Nerves.
TERRY: Sweet Lord. This is a team for the ages. Kyle knocks on the door. Stemler is with him.
MIKE: What's up, guys?
KYLE: Stemler wants to wrestle today.
MIKE: You do?
STEMLER: Yeah, Coach. I'm pretty sure I'm ready. Right?
KYLE: Right.
MIKE: Where you gonna wrestle?
KYLE: He could wrestle 119. I could bump up and get a pin at 125 and Jimmy goes 130. Then we're only giving up one weight class and we got a shot. Vig and Terry look at Mike.
MIKE: Huh. Vig?
VIG: Yeah. He's right. It's possible.
TERRY: Have you ever wrestled in a match before Stemler?
STEMLER: No, I have not.
KYLE: You're just waiting for the green light, right?
STEMLER: Right. I think now is my time. I can feel the force. The three coaches all look at each other.
BH COACH: One twenty-five. Vigman reads off the roster.
VIGMAN: We start at 125 pounds. Depasquale and Timmons. We'll finish at 119 pounds. Tomlinson and Stemler.
STEMLER (CONT'D): Show time.
VIGMAN: Thanks for the update Stemler.
TERRY: We're dead.
MIKE: No. It's gonna be fine.
MIKE: Hook the arm! Carlos, hook the arm! Carlos does and holds on for the win. The team cheers. Mike turns to Vigman and Terry.
MIKE (CONT'D): How we doing?
VIGMAN: With that win, we're up by five. If Stemler doesn't get pinned, we win.
TERRY: That's a huge fucking "if".
VIGMAN: Good job, Ter.
TERRY: Sorry, Stemler. You're a champ.
MIKE: Come here, Stemler. Mike takes Stemler by the shoulders.
MIKE (CONT'D): You've been practicing for a long time. You're ready for this. You hear me? Stemler nods.
MIKE (CONT'D): If you get in trouble out there, you just listen to me. I'm right here, OK? Stemler nods again. Too scared to respond.
MIKE (CONT'D): OK. You are not going to get pinned! You hear me! No way!
STEMLER: No way. No way.
MIKE: Good. Now I'm going to slap you. Ready?
STEMLER: Yeah but not so hard. Mike gives him an odd half-slap and Stemler runs out to the mat and takes his place at the line. The team cheers. But then the other WRESTLER runs out. He is wearing a BLACK PROTECTIVE FACE MASK. Stemler spins away from the line and looks pleading at Mike.
STEMLER (CONT'D): Holy shit! It's Darth Vader! Are you kidding me? No way! He does look like Darth Vader. But in a singlet.
KYLE: Hey, Stemler. Come here. Stemler walks over.
KYLE (CONT'D): If he's Darth Vader then you're the Secret Apprentice. You got this. Stemler buys it.
STEMLER: Yeah. You're right. Stemler returns to the line slightly more confident. The Ref blows the whistle and the match starts. Stemler is immediately taken down. Terry looks at his feet.
TERRY: I can't watch.
LATER -: It's late in third period. Stemler is losing 13-0. Stemler is flat on his belly and he's getting mauled. The Ref calls him for stalling. One point. 14-0. Thirty seconds to go.
MIKE: Keep moving, Stemler. Keep working!
VIGMAN: (Reading score card) Oh shit. Oh shit!
TERRY: What?
VIGMAN: He's one point away from a tech fall and we'd lose on criteria.
MIKE: Shit. Really?
TERRY: What the hell does that mean?
VIGMAN: If he falls behind by fifteen points it's a technical fall. They get five team points. If that happens the score would be tied but we'd lose the match on criteria.
TERRY: Seriously?
MIKE: Fuck this! Mike drops to the mat.
MIKE (CONT'D): Stemler! Stemler!! Stemler looks over. His eyes are wild.
MIKE (CONT'D): You need to get up! He's trying to drown you! He wants you dead. But you are not going to die on the bottom! Do you hear me? Do you?! Stemler manages a nod, albeit a terrified one.
MIKE (CONT'D): Good! Now just do the move we worked on in practice. Off Stemler's confused look.
MIKE (CONT'D): "Whatever the fuck it takes!" Stemler almost manages a smile and then he hits "the move". It's not pretty but somehow he manages to get up and out. The team goes nuts. One point for Stemler. 15-1. The Other kid frantically tries to take him down but Stemler holds him off dancing wildly around the mat. The buzzer sounds. The team goes nuts. The Ref raises the other wrestler's hand in victory but it's Stemler who celebrates as if he just won the states. He runs off the mat and into the arms of his teammates.
MIKE: Hey, I'm proud of what you did today. That win meant a lot to the guys.
KYLE: Cool. It was good coaching with Stemler.
MIKE: Let me ask you something. What's it like? Being as good as you are? What's it feel like?
KYLE: I don't know. I guess it just feels like I'm in control. Of everything. You know what I mean?
MIKE: Yeah, I do. Must be nice.
KYLE: It is.
VIGMAN: That's it.
MIKE: Yeah.
TERRY: District champ, baby.
VIGMAN: Pure fucking poetry. The Ref slaps the mat and it's over.
KYLE: Hey, Leo. Guess who won the Districts?
LEO: Who?
KYLE: Me. And Mike said he got a call from a college scout about me.
LEO: Oh.
KYLE: What are you doing here?
CINDY: I came to get you, honey. And to see Grandpa. I missed you so much. Can I have a hug, baby? Kyle looks at Leo who just shrugs. Finally, he walks toward her but then veers away and runs from the room.
LEO: Where's he going?
CINDY: Oh, he's just had to go somewhere, Dad. Do you want some juice?
MIKE: How is he?
JACKIE: He's upset. I don't blame him. It's weird that she just shows up like that. (Checking her watch) And of course she's late, the druggie.
MIKE: Honey. Can you stop, please?
JACKIE: You're gonna talk to her, right?
MIKE: Yeah. I am. If you don't punch her first. Car lights in the window. Mike looks out the window.
MIKE (CONT'D): It's a cab. It's her.
JACKIE: It's not my fault if I punch her.
MIKE: Yeah, it is. That will be your fault. Jackie picks up Stella. The door bell rings. Mike answers it. Cindy is standing there. She looks nervous.
MIKE (CONT'D): Hi. I'm Mike Flaherty. Come in, please.
CINDY: Hi.
MIKE: And this is my wife, Jackie and my daughter, Stella.
CINDY: Hi.
JACKIE: Hi, Cindy. Nice to meet you.
CINDY: She's very cute.
JACKIE: Thanks. Abby, our six year old, is downstairs with Kyle.
CINDY: Oh. OK. Awkward pause.
JACKIE: Do you want to sit down?
CINDY: Thanks. This is a very nice house.
JACKIE: Thank you very much.
MIKE: Can I get you a drink or something? Jackie shoots Mike a look. A drink?
MIKE (CONT'D): Water or soda or anything?
CINDY: No. No thanks. I'm fine.
MIKE: Right. OK. So I'll go get Kyle. Mike starts to go but Cindy doesn't quite seem ready.
CINDY: How's he doing?
MIKE: Oh, he's doing really well. He's going to the high school here and he's wrestling on the team actually.
CINDY: Really? That's good. He loves wrestling so much.
JACKIE: He's a really sweet kid. Our girls love him.
CINDY: That's nice. Cindy starts to tremble.
CINDY (CONT'D): I am so sorry about this...it's just been such a difficult time... Jackie and Mike share a look. Then Jackie caves and slides over next to her.
JACKIE: Oh hey...these things happen, Cindy. And we've loved having him.
MIKE: Hi, honey. This is Abby.
CINDY: Hi Abby.
ABBY: Hi.
MIKE: Abby, can you go get Kyle for us?
ABBY: He left.
MIKE: He left? What do you mean?
ABBY: He left out the window.
MIKE: I'm really sorry about this.
CINDY: That's okay. Thanks.
MIKE: You know Kyle's doing really well with wrestling here, Cindy. The regions are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states.
CINDY: That's great.
MIKE: Yeah. It is and it could be really good for him. It might even mean a scholarship. Anyway, I was wondering if you could stay here for another three weeks until that's all over.
CINDY: I'd like to but don't think I can afford to stay in the hotel for that long. Do you think we could stay in my dad's house? This is not what Mike wanted but he's stuck.
MIKE: Uhh...yeah. We could probably make that work.
CINDY: Then, yeah, I could stay.
MIKE: OK. Good. That's great. Mike's phone rings.
MIKE (CONT'D): Hey.
MIKE: Really?
(TO CINDY): We found him.
TERRY: Yeah. We're playing Wii Golf. I'm destroying him. Dude, this kid really hates his mother.
MIKE: Yeah, OK.
MIKE: Great, Ter. Thanks. Bye. (Mike hangs up) He went to my friend's house. We can go get him.
CINDY: Maybe I'll just go back to the hotel. It might just be too much for him tonight. I can see him tomorrow.
MIKE: You sure?
CINDY: Yeah. I think maybe that's better. I know how Kyle can be.
MIKE: OK. I'll drop you off. Mike keeps driving.
KYLE: So when wrestling's over I have to go?
MIKE: I'm afraid so, pal. She's staying so you can finish the season. That's pretty nice of her. They arrive back at Mike's house. Mike is really winded.
MIKE (CONT'D): I told her you'd go see her today, Kyle.
KYLE: Where?
MIKE: Where ever you want. She could come here or we could go see her at Leo's house. She moving in this morning. Kyle thinks.
KYLE: I'll go see her at Leo's before practice. But I want to go alone.
MIKE: Yeah, that's OK but Kyle but you have to promise me...
KYLE: Don't worry, Mike. I'll go. Mike turns and spots his OLD NEIGHBOR watching him.
OLD NEIGHBOR: Hi Mike.
MIKE: Hi Betty. How's the foot?
BETTY: Better.
SHELLY: Mike? Cindy's here.
MIKE: Really? Did she say why?
SHELLY: No. But she's here with an attorney. Mike gets up and opens the door to his office. Eleanor and Cindy stand to greet him.
MIKE: Hi Cindy. Hi, I'm Mike Flaherty.
ELEANOR: Hi, I'm Eleanor Cohen.
MIKE: Please come in. He leads them into his office.
MIKE (CONT'D): I wasn't aware that Cindy was represented by council.
ELEANOR: She retained me last week to help sort out her father's situation.
MIKE: Last week? I thought she just arrived two days ago.
(MIKE SITS): How long have you been here?
ELEANOR: She wanted a little time to settle in and spend some time with her father.
MIKE: So how can I help?
ELEANOR: Cindy has decided that she wants a more active role in her father's care.
MIKE: What kind of a role is that?
CINDY: I want to take care of him.
MIKE: Really? So you want to move here?
ELEANOR: No. Cindy would like to bring her father back to Columbus.
CINDY: That's where my support network is now. It's home.
MIKE: Well I'm not sure that's what Leo wants.
CINDY: I already talked to him about it. He seem to like the idea.
MIKE: I understand that, Cindy. But you haven't seen Leo in a long time and he's battling dementia now so it puts me in a tough position here.
ELEANOR: She is the presumed Guardian, Mr Flaherty.
MIKE: I understand that.
ELEANOR: And we do hope to avoid litigation.
MIKE: So do I and I'm sure we can. Now, I'm sorry, but I actually have to go see a client so we'll have to set up another time to discuss this.
CINDY: Kyle's still coming to see me today, right?
MIKE: Yeah. Of course. After school.
ELEANOR: I'll have my office call. Come on Cindy.
CINDY: Thanks Mike. Mike nods and Eleanor and Cindy leave. Mike watches them go.
MIKE: Yeah, it's that bad.
TERRY: Just take her to court, you'll kill her.
MIKE: I can't.
TERRY: Why not? She's a freaking mess. You're a pillar of the community, Mike.
MIKE: I just can't go back in front of Judge Lee, it won't look good, trust me.
TERRY: So maybe you'll get a different judge.
MIKE: She's the only Judge who handles these cases and if I look bad in front of her right now, I'm screwed. I'll have to close my fricking doors.
TERRY: Then dump it. Give her Poplar. It sucks but you've got your practice to worry about, right?
MIKE: Yeah, I do.
TERRY: Incoming, dude. Mike turns. Kyle approaches.
MIKE: Hey, pal.
KYLE: Do you know she wants to take Leo back to Ohio?
MIKE: Yeah. She just told me today.
KYLE: You're not gonna let her do that are you?
MIKE: I don't know Kyle. It's complicated.
KYLE: What's complicated about it? She doesn't give a shit about Leo. They hate each other. You can't let her take him.
MIKE: OK. OK. Look, just go get ready for practice and I'll deal with it.
KYLE: Fine but I told her I'm staying with you guys until we leave. Kyle leaves. Terry just looks at Mike.
TERRY: Wow. What's your play?
MIKE: I have no idea. I have no freaking idea!
TERRY: She's looking for a payout, dude. Just buy her stake and give her an exit.
MIKE: What the hell does that mean?
TERRY: Just give her some of Leo's money and send her home. He's not gonna miss it. He's in happy land.
MIKE: No, I can't do that. She's not even in his... Mike stops. A flash of inspiration.
MIKE (CONT'D): That's right. She's not and she doesn't and that's my play.
TERRY: What's your play? Mike takes out his phone and dials.
MIKE: Don't worry about it. I just need to make a call. Can you get practice started?
TERRY: Really? You want me to slap your face? Get you psyched up for the call?
MIKE: No. I really don't.
ELEANOR: So do we.
MIKE: Good, well, I thought I'd start by laying all the cards on the table, so maybe you can understand why I'm hesitating in turning Leo over to Cindy.
MIKE: Cindy, your father disinherited you from his will. Completely. And I'm afraid that can't change now that he's been declared incapacitated.
CINDY: Is that true?
ELEANOR: We'll have to see a copy of the will, Mike.
MIKE: Yeah. I actually brought you a copy. Mike reaches into his briefcase and puts the A COPY OF THE WILL on Eleanor's desk.
CINDY: Who did he leave it too? Did he leave it to Kyle?!
MIKE: No.
CINDY: Then who? You?
MIKE: No. He left everything to the municipal parks system. He wanted the town park dedicated in his name.
CINDY: That scumbag! He never cared about anyone but himself and his fucking money. Did you know about this?
ELEANOR: Cindy please!
CINDY: Please what?
ELEANOR: (Annoyed to Mike) I'd like to discuss this with my client, Mr. Flaherty.
CINDY: What's to discuss? I'm not taking care of him if I'm not getting anything for it.
ELEANOR: Cindy, please.
(TO MIKE): We're finished here.
MIKE: Mike gets up and walks out. A smile creeps across his face.
TERRY: Brass balls, buddy. Brass balls.
MIKE: Yeah. And she's gone back to the motel.
TERRY: That's good.
MIKE: Yes, it is. Yeah, I think it worked.
TERRY: It totally worked. They opened their kimono and you made them eat the trade.
MIKE: I don't what know what your talking about half the time.
TERRY: Really?
MIKE: Yeah. Really.
MIKE: It's time, Coach.
(TO KYLE): You ready? Kyle just walks out of the warm-up room.
VIGMAN: He's ready.
TERRY: Yeah, he is.
VIGMAN: Wow. This is big time. I bet there are scouts here.
TERRY: Definitely. And wait till we get to the states! Atlantic City here we come, baby.
VIGMAN: Atlantic City. Fierce. Mike smiles but then his smile fades. Cindy Timmons is standing against the wall. She steps forward and Kyle sees
CINDY: Good luck, baby. Kyle keeps his head down and keeps walking. Mike looks shocked but also keeps walking.
MIKE: Listen to me. One more win and we are going to the states. That's what counts. That's all that matters. You hear me? Kyle nods. Mike can tell that he's half listening.
MIKE (CONT'D): Hey! Kyle. Stay in this, OK. This is your place. You are in control, remember! You control it. Now go get him. Finish this! Mike slaps him. And Kyle races to the mat. The wrestlers slap hands and THE REF blows the whistle. Kyle immediately shoots in for a double leg. The Other Wrestler tries to sprawl but Kyle is in too deep. Kyle lifts him high and dumps him hard to the mat. The audience reacts and the Ref stops the action. The other wrestler bravely pops up but he is obviously stung.
REF: Warning. Red. One point.
MIKE: Kyle! Hey! Control! Control! Kyle looks at Mike and nods but his eyes are wild. The Ref blows the whistle and Kyle and the Other Wrestler lock up. They dance a bit and finally the Other Wrestler tries to wrap Kyle up. Kyle back pedals and then literally throws the Other Wrestler off the mat. The Ref has seen enough. He quickly issues Kyle his second warning and disqualifies him from the match. It's over. The Other Wrestler pops up and runs at Kyle. Kyle responds. The Coaches all intervene. It's a melee.
MIKE: How you doing?
KYLE: I'm sorry.
MIKE: Hey, it's alright. Mike puts his arm on his shoulder and Kyle starts to cry. Mike squeezes him.
KYLE: I don't want to go with her. I don't.
MIKE: OK, pal. OK.
MIKE: Why are you here?
CINDY: I wanted to see my son wrestle.
MIKE: Yeah, well your son had a pretty good chance to do something special in there. Maybe even change his life and that's gone now. I hope you're happy.
CINDY: That's not my fault.
MIKE: It isn't? Why do you think he lost his shit in there, huh?! What do you want, lady?
CINDY: I want my father.
MIKE: It didn't sound like that the other day. It sounded like you hated the guy.
CINDY: You have no idea what my father used to be like. No idea! He wasn't like he is now! He treated me like shit and he was all I had!
MIKE: So now you want to return the favor? Is that it?!
CINDY: I want that commission! That should be mine!
MIKE: And that's why you're doing all this? For fifteen hundred dollars a month?
CINDY: Isn't that why you did it? This stops Mike in his tracks.
MIKE: Alright, I'll tell you what. You want the commission? You can have it. And you don't even have to take Leo. I'll take care of him for free and I'll send you the check every month. On one condition.
CINDY: What's that?
MIKE: You leave Kyle here. With us. Until he finishes high school.
CINDY: I'm his mother. He belongs with me.
MIKE: Are you sure he feels that way?
CINDY: Don't tell me what my son feels! He's coming with me and there isn't anything you can do about that.
MIKE: Then you can't have that commission.
CINDY: We'll see about that.
MIKE: Yeah, we will. Mike turns and walks away.
CINDY: I want to see my son!
MIKE: Then call him! You have his number!
TERRY: We were right there, Mike. Right fucking there. And now we have nothing. Nothing! Terry screams. It's a primal scream. Mike just looks at him.
MIKE: You OK?
TERRY: No. Terry drinks. Mike watches him. Jackie pops out from the kitchen.
JACKIE: Mike, your mom's here and dinner's almost ready. Have you seen Kyle?
MIKE: He's not in the basement?
JACKIE: No.
TERRY: I'll track him down.
MIKE: Thanks, Terry.
TERRY: What a day, huh?
JACKIE: Yeah, right. Terry goes inside. Jackie sits next to Mike.
JACKIE (CONT'D): You OK? Mike shrugs.
JACKIE (CONT'D): What are we gonna do, Mike?
MIKE: There's nothing to do. I can't stop her. She's gonna leave and she's gonna take Kyle and Leo with her.
JACKIE: And you don't think you'd beat her in court?
MIKE: No. I don't.
JACKIE: Why? It's so obvious she's just wants him for the money. Mike turns to Jackie. He wants to tell her but just can't.
MIKE: I just can't win this one, Jackie. Trust me. Jackie misinterprets Mike's guilt for pain. She backs off.
JACKIE: I do.
CINDY: Kyle, honey, come in. I'm so glad you came. She steps back and he enters.
CINDY (CONT'D): Have a seat, honey. Do you want a soda or something? He sits on one bed.
KYLE: No. What do you want? She sits on the other facing him.
CINDY: I just wanted to say how sorry I was about the match and if I did anything to cause it then I will never forgive myself. I know how much wrestling means to you, baby.
KYLE: Is that why you called me. Just to tell me that?
CINDY: No. I also wanted to say that I'll do whatever you think is best for Leo. I promise.
KYLE: Then leave him here. Where he is.
CINDY: OK. I will. If that's what you want. But I have to be honest, I'm not sure that's what Leo wants.
KYLE: What do you mean?
CINDY: Here. Read this.
KYLE: What is it?
CINDY: It's the court transcript from when Leo was in court. My lawyer got it. Read the parts in yellow. See what it says. Kyle reluctantly reads it.
KYLE: This isn't real. The Judge told Leo he had to live there.
CINDY: No, honey. This is official from the court. It's what Mike said. Kyle reads it again.
CINDY (CONT'D): He gets paid for being Leo's guardian, Kyle. And then he just put him in that place so he didn't have to worry about him. Kyle stares at the page.
CINDY (CONT'D): Leo belongs with us, Kyle.
KYLE: Why? Cindy is caught of guard by the question.
CINDY: Why what?
KYLE: Why does he belong with us? Cindy judges her son's look and speaks from the heart.
CINDY: Because we deserve that money, Kyle. Not some lawyer. You're a big boy. You can understand that.
KYLE: Shut up! Shut up! She finally quiets. Terrified.
KYLE (CONT'D): Listen to me! I don't care about this. It's all bullshit. Leave Leo alone. He belongs here. Do you hear me? Do you? Cindy can only cry and nod. Kyle grabs the paper and runs out the door.
MIKE: OK. Thanks, Karen. I appreciate it. Bye. Jackie walks into the room.
JACKIE: Anything?
MIKE: He's not at Stemler's.
JACKIE: This is crazy, where could he be?
MIKE: I don't know, he's upset, maybe he went for a walk.
JACKIE: Well we should take a drive, your mom can stay with the kids. His phone rings. Jackie stops.
MIKE: Hello. Yes, this is him. What?
STAFF MEMBER: Sir, stay calm, we'll find him.
MIKE: Stay calm? You've lost my ward!
JACKIE: Mike! Calm down.
MIKE TERRY: Calm down?! We are gonna sue you guys, silly. He's a laywer! The Staff Member picks up the phone.
STAFF MEMBER: Look, he's definitely not on the premises. A lot of the time they just try to go home. We're about to go there. Mike and Jackie share a look and leave. Terry turns to some residents who are looking on.
TERRY: Hey folks, listen up! Watch out for each other.
TERRY: There's a light on.
JACKIE: It's got to be him. Do have the key?
MIKE: No. I didn't bring it with me. They arrive at the front door. Mike tries the knob. It's locked.
MIKE (CONT'D): Shit. Mike goes to edge of the porch, climbs up onto the railing and looks into the side window. Leo is sitting in a chair watching TV.
MIKE (CONT'D): There he is!
JACKIE: What's he doing?
MIKE: Watching TV.
TERRY: What's he watching?
JACKIE: Who cares?
MIKE: Leo? Hey Leo? Mike knocks on the window. Leo doesn't register it.
MIKE (CONT'D): He's not responding. Ring the bell. Jackie does. Leo still doesn't respond.
MIKE (CONT'D): Nothing. Fuck.
TERRY: This is freaking spooky. Mike climbs down back onto the porch.
TERRY (CONT'D): Should we break in?
MIKE: I have a key back at the office. I could go get it.
JACKIE: Is he OK?
MIKE: He seems it. He's just sitting there.
LEO: Hi.
LEO: Come on in. Leo walks away. They all follow him.
TERRY: OK. That is very creepy.
MIKE: You OK, Leo? Leo just watches TV.
MIKE (CONT'D): How did you get here, pal? Mike stoops over and tries to connect with Leo.
MIKE (CONT'D): Did you walk here, Leo? Leo turns and looks at them as if he is about to speak. The all wait for his reply and then...
JACKIE MIKE: Kyle? You took Leo?
KYLE (CONT'D): Yeah.
MIKE: Have you lost your mind?! We've been worried sick about him!
JACKIE: About both of you!
KYLE: You don't have to worry about us. Kyle walks out of the room.
TERRY: OK. That's super spooky. Just saying.
MIKE: Kyle, What the hell are you doing?
KYLE: Making spaghetti.
MIKE: Have you lost your mind?
KYLE: No.
JACKIE: Kyle, why did you do this? Please just tell us. Leo needs to be in a home.
KYLE: This is where he belongs.
JACKIE: Kyle he needs to be at Oak Knoll.
MIKE: Kyle, we talked about this.
KYLE: Yeah. We did! Listen to this. Kyle takes a piece of paper out of his pocket.
KYLE (CONT'D): Mike Flaherty: Mr. Poplar wants to live at home. Judge Lee: You can do that Mike? Mike Flaherty: Yes, I can. Really.
JACKIE: What is that? Jackie takes it and looks at it.
KYLE: It's from the court.
JACKIE: Where did you get this?
KYLE: From my mother.
(TO MIKE): It's true isn't, Mike?
JACKIE: Mike? Mike can't answer. Kyle's seen enough.
KYLE: You're just like her. He runs out. They all give chase.
MIKE: Hey. Hey, Kyle. Kyle keeps walking.
MIKE (CONT'D): Hey can you hold on a second?
KYLE: Leave me alone!
MIKE: Kyle please.
KYLE: Don't touch me! Mike deflects Kyle and Kyle spills to the ground.
TERRY: Oh shit. Kyle gets up and starts to circle Mike. Mike has no choice but reciprocate.
MIKE: Would you let me explain?!
KYLE: Explain what? How you lied to me? How you lied to Leo? Kyle head pumps. Mike takes the bait and jumps back.
MIKE TERRY: Kyle wait... Watch the head fake!
MIKE: Kyle I don't want to wrestle you.
JACKIE TERRY: Kyle, stop for a minute. Keep your hands out, Mike. Hands out.
JACKIE: Terry, stop it!
TERRY: I'm just trying to help.
JACKIE: You're not helping. Kyle head fakes again but this time he's in. Before Mike knows what hits him, he's on his back.
MIKE TERRY: Ow! Oh shit.
JACKIE (CONT'D): Mike, stop it! Kyle is all over Mike. Mike's trying to fight back but it's useless and even kind of pathetic.
MIKE: I'm trying to stop it!
TERRY: Sit out Mike! Sit out!
JACKIE MIKE: Shut up, Terry! Kyle, stop it! Mike gets up to hands and knees but Kyle drives him hard to the ground.
JACKIE: Would you stop coaching and break that up! Terry rushes in and tries to pull Kyle off but he's lost it. Finally, he wraps his arms around Kyle and pulls him off. Kyle spins free and fronts Terry. Terry immediately puts up his hands.
TERRY: I'm the ref. I'm just the ref! Kyle turns and runs off.
JACKIE: Kyle! Stop! Please! He doesn't stop. Jackie turns to Mike.
JACKIE (CONT'D): Is that true, Mike?
MIKE: Yeah, it is. Mike gets up.
JACKIE: So why'd you move him if he wanted to stay here.
MIKE: Because it would have been too much work to leave him here. I couldn't have done it.
JACKIE: Then you shouldn't have taken him.
MIKE: I had to, alright?
JACKIE: Why?!
MIKE: Because I needed the money! We needed the money.
JACKIE: You moved an old man out of his house to make money? Have you lost your freaking mind?
MIKE: No! I just didn't think it would get this complicated.
JACKIE: Really? Or you just didn't think you'd get caught? This stops Mike in his tracks. He can't answer. Jackie turns and walks away.
MIKE: Jack! Jack, where are you going?
JACKIE: Home! She walks away.
KYLE: Hello. Hello. Mom? She's not there. He hangs up. Kyle starts to put on his shoes.
STEMLER: Did your mom just crank call you?
KYLE: No.
STEMLER: So you and Coach Mike get in a fight because you lost?
KYLE: No. We got in a fight because he's an asshole.
STEMLER: Really?
KYLE: Yeah, really, Stem.
STEMLER: Well I'm sure he'll make it up to you, bro. You're the best wrestler he's ever had. I mean he's always been cool to me and I suck. This comment lands with Kyle.
MIKE: Hey Leo.
LEO: Hi.
MIKE: I fell asleep. I'm sorry.
LEO: Sorry for what? That's a big question. Mike cuts to the chase.
MIKE: You want to go home?
LEO: Yeah.
JACKIE: Hi.
MIKE: Hi. Is he here?
JACKIE: No. He slept at Stemler's. How about you?
MIKE: Oak Knoll.
(BEAT): You're right, that's not who I am.
JACKIE: So what are you going to do?
MIKE: I have to go court.
JACKIE: You can't. You told the Judge you were keeping Leo at home.
MIKE: I know.
JACKIE: So then tell her you changed your mind. No one can question that.
MIKE: I can't, Jack.
JACKIE: Why not?
MIKE: Because it's not true.
JACKIE: Well I'm glad your done lying now, just in time to lose your practice. That's how we survive, Mike. Your family. You ever think of that?
MIKE: Yeah. All the time. Jackie quickly crosses to the sink. She starts to clean. She breaks something.
JACKIE: Shit. She braces herself against the sink and exhales. Mike just watches her.
MIKE: I'm sorry, Jack. I really am.
JACKIE: I know. A noise from the basement. Mike heads down the stairs.
JACKIE: Hey Kyle. How'd you get down here?
KYLE: The window.
JACKIE: Are you hungry? I was gonna make some pancakes.
KYLE: No. I'm leaving. I just came to get my shit. They share a look and walk over to Kyle.
MIKE: Kyle, listen, I just wanted to say I'm sorry...
KYLE: I know, Mike, you're sorry. Everyone's always sorry.
MIKE: I moved Leo back home, Kyle. And I'm gonna fight to keep him there.
KYLE: It's too late. You'll lose. My mother's gonna take him.
MIKE: Maybe but I'm still gonna try.
KYLE: So what?! You want me to forgive you now? Is that it, Mike?!
MIKE: No. I just want you to give me another chance. That's all I'm asking. Mike's sincerity is undeniable. Kyle looks to Jackie. They connect. Kyle shakes his head, turns around, and then throws his bag.
KYLE: This is bullshit! Mike looks at Jackie.
MIKE: Hey, Kyle, listen -
KYLE: I want to be alone.
MIKE: What?
KYLE: (Without looking at them)
MIKE: OK. All right. Yeah. Jackie and Mike turn and start to walk upstairs but Jackie stops.
JACKIE: Kyle, I just wanna say - we love you. Kyle keeps his back turned to them as they continue up the stairs.
TERRY: Hi guys.
MIKE: What are you doing here?
TERRY: Dude, I'm your assistant coach. And just notice who isn't here. Mike smiles.
TERRY (CONT'D): Stephen Vigman.
MIKE: Yeah, I got it. Terry puts his arm on his friend's shoulder.
ELEANOR: Mike? Mike turns. Eleanor approaches.
MIKE: Hi Eleanor.
ELEANOR: Can I talk to you?
MIKE: Sure. Mike and Eleanor step to the side. She looks at Mike.
ELEANOR: You know the transcript alone is enough to hang you.
MIKE: Yeah, well, we'll see what happens. Eleanor just looks at him, Judge and Jury. Mike blinks.
ELEANOR: Shame on you counselor.
MIKE: Is that it?
ELEANOR: No. My client would like to talk to you. Mike and Eleanor walk over to Cindy. She is barely holding it together.
MIKE: Hi Cindy.
CINDY: Hi. Is your deal still available? Mike tries to conceal his shock.
MIKE: What about Kyle? Cindy and Eleanor share a look.
CINDY: He can stay.
MIKE: Then yes. It is.
CINDY: And you'll send me the checks?
MIKE: Every month.
CINDY: You take good care of him.
MIKE: We will. Cindy nods.
CINDY: I want to say goodbye. Mike turns and waves Kyle over. Kyle look to Jackie who gives him the OK. He walks over as Mike steps away. He just looks at his mother. She gently touches his face. He doesn't move. Everyone looks on as Cindy says a few words to Kyle, hugs him hard and then quickly turns and walks away. Kyle watches her go.
STEMLER: I know. Don't rush me. Stemler hits a shot and the ball goes into the garden.
STEMLER (CONT'D): This mallet is crap! You see that? Mike pulls up and gets out of his car, wearing a suit and carrying his briefcase.
MIKE: Hi guys!
ABBY: Hi, Daddy. I'm winning.
STEMLER KYLE: What's up, coach? Hi.
MIKE: That's great, honey. Kyle, can you drag those garbage cans to the side of the house for me?
MIKE: Thanks, pal. He runs inside.
MIKE: Hi Honey.
MIKE: Good. I got stuck at the office with a client. Jackie walks in from the other room, gives Mike a kiss.
JACKIE: I know, Shelly called. Oh, I dropped off the fan at Leo's today.
MIKE: Thanks for doing that. Mike heads upstairs.
MIKE (CONT'D): I'll be right back down.
JACKIE: Do you have time to eat.
MIKE: I'll eat there.
JACKIE: Make sure you do.
TERRY: Can I get a banana daiquiri, please? The Bartender turns. It's Mike.
MIKE: Sure. Mike opens a beer and sets it down in front of Terry.
MIKE (CONT'D): You want an umbrella with that?
TERRY: Nah. I'm good. But keep these coming. Mike checks a ticket and prepares two drinks.
TERRY (CONT'D): So how you doing, pal?
MIKE: Me? I'm pretty good. We hold on Mike as he continues to work.
