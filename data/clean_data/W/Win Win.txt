VIGMAN: I don't really care at this point. If it makes him happy, he can have it. I get nothing from that kid.

THATCHER: Yeah, well that hardly qualifies him to be Leo's Guardian. What's the motivation here? Thatcher is turning up the heat. He obviously wants Poplar. Mike is starting to feel it.
JUDGE LEE: Mike looks back at Leo who is trying to unscrew the cap on his water bottle, completely uninterested in the proceedings. He makes a decision.
MIKE: Your Honor, Leo told me he wants to live at home. He has the money to do that and I want to make sure that happens. If the State can do that then fine.

MIKE: So let me ask you something, Kyle. How good are you? Kyle just looks at Mike, almost blank.
KYLE: I'm pretty good.
MIKE: Holy shit.
TERRY: Holy shit!
MIKE: I know, right? Can you believe Terry is in the den at his computer, reading excitedly.

TERRY: So what? Enroll him!
MIKE: I'm not enrolling him. He's just here until we reach his mother and figure this out.
TERRY: So he's gotta do something, right? Let him wrestle. Look at this way, you're helping out the old man and this kid's a little bonus for doing the right thing.
MIKE: I'm not just helping out the old man, Ter. It's not like it's charity work. I'm getting paid for No. Shit, everyone gets paid, but think about it, Mike. What are the chances that this kid ends up on your door step and he can wrestle like that? It's a sign, pal. This lands with Mike. Terry sits down at his computer.
TERRY: No. Shit, everyone gets paid, but think about it, Mike. What are the chances that this kid ends up on your door step and he can wrestle like that? It's a sign, pal. This lands with Mike. Terry sits down at his computer.

MIKE: OK. Let's go, pal.
JACKIE: Bye Jackie. Kyle leaves. Mike kisses Jackie.

JACKIE: OK. Go.
SHELLY: Hey Mike, we got a check from Leo Poplar's trust for $1,500 but it's made out to you and not the firm.
MIKE: Right. I'll take that. Mike gets up and takes the check.

Kyle counters and throws Kenny to his back. Before anyone can blink, Kyle pins him. Mike, Terry, and Vigman explode off their chairs.
VIGMAN: He just pinned Kenny Randall. Are you kidding me?! Kenny Randall looks shocked. He throws off his head gear and gets up. The MILBURN COACHES look equally shocked. The Ref raises Kyle's hands. Kyle runs over to shake the Milburn Coaches hand and then he runs back to his bench and is greeted by Mike.
KYLE: He know's who I am now. Mike smiles as the team greets him.

KYLE: I guess.
JACKIE: It's true. And you know who would agree with me?
KYLE: Jackie lifts her leg.
JACKIE: Nope. JBJ. Jackie lifts her leg exposing her tatoo. Kyle smiles.
VIGMAN: They don't have anyone at Really? Korsic will be happy. Tell him now so he doesn't puke.

MIKE: You do?
STEMLER: Yeah, Coach. I'm pretty sure I'm ready. Right?
KYLE: Where you gonna wrestle?
MIKE: Where you gonna wrestle?
KYLE: He could wrestle 119. I could bump up and get a pin at 125 and Jimmy goes 130. Then we're only giving up one weight class and we got a shot. Vig and Terry look at Mike.
MIKE: Huh. Vig?
VIG: Yeah. He's right. It's possible.
TERRY: Have you ever wrestled in a match before Stemler?
STEMLER: No, I have not.
KYLE: You're just waiting for the green light, right?
STEMLER: Right. I think now is my time. I can feel the force. The three coaches all look at each other.
BH COACH: One twenty-five. Vigman reads off the roster.
VIGMAN: We start at 125 pounds. Depasquale and Timmons. We'll finish at 119 pounds. Tomlinson and Stemler.

MIKE: Hook the arm! Carlos, hook the arm! Carlos does and holds on for the win. The team cheers. Mike turns to Vigman and Terry.
VIGMAN: With that win, we're up by five. If Stemler doesn't get pinned, we win.
TERRY: That's a huge fucking "if".
VIGMAN: Good job, Ter.
TERRY: Sorry, Stemler. You're a champ.
MIKE: Come here, Stemler. Mike takes Stemler by the shoulders.
STEMLER: ( BARELY AUDIBLE )
MIKE: Good. Now I'm going to slap you. Yeah but not so hard. Mike gives him an odd half-slap and Stemler runs out to the mat and takes his place at the line. The team cheers. But then the other WRESTLER runs out. He is wearing a BLACK PROTECTIVE FACE MASK. Stemler spins away from the line and looks pleading at Mike.
STEMLER: Yeah but not so hard. Mike gives him an odd half-slap and Stemler runs out to the mat and takes his place at the line. The team cheers. But then the other WRESTLER runs out. He is wearing a BLACK PROTECTIVE FACE MASK. Stemler spins away from the line and looks pleading at Mike.
KYLE: Hey, Stemler. Come here. Stemler walks over.
STEMLER: Yeah. You're right. Stemler returns to the line slightly more confident. The Ref blows the whistle and the match starts. Stemler is immediately taken down. Terry looks at his feet.
TERRY: I can't watch.
MIKE: Keep moving, Stemler. Keep working!
VIGMAN: ( Reading score card ) Oh shit. Oh shit!
TERRY: He's one point away from a tech fall and we'd lose on criteria.
VIGMAN: He's one point away from a tech fall and we'd lose on criteria.
MIKE: Shit. Really?
TERRY: What the hell does that mean?
VIGMAN: If he falls behind by fifteen points it's a technical fall. They get five team points. If that happens the score would be tied but we'd lose the match on criteria.
TERRY: 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 79 Fuck this! Mike drops to the mat.
MIKE: Fuck this! Mike drops to the mat.

LEO: Where's he going?
CINDY: Oh, he's just had to go somewhere, Dad. Do you want some juice?

CINDY: I'd like to but don't think I can afford to stay in the hotel for that long. Do you think we could stay in my dad's house? This is not what Mike wanted but he's stuck.
MIKE: Uhh.yeah. We could probably make that work.
CINDY: Then, yeah, I could stay.
MIKE: OK. Good. That's great. Mike's phone rings.

MIKE: Where ever you want. She could come here or we could go see her at Leo's house. She moving in this Kyle thinks.
KYLE: I'll go see her at Leo's before practice. But I want to go alone.

MIKE: Well I'm not sure that's what Leo I already talked to him about it. He seem to like the idea.
CINDY: I already talked to him about it. He seem to like the idea.
MIKE: I understand that, Cindy. But you haven't seen Leo in a long time and he's battling dementia now so it puts me in a tough position here.
ELEANOR: She is the presumed Guardian, Mr I understand that.
MIKE: I understand that.
ELEANOR: And we do hope to avoid litigation.

KYLE: You're not gonna let her do that are you?
MIKE: I don't know Kyle. It's What's complicated about it? She doesn't give a shit about Leo. They hate each other. You can't let her take him.
KYLE: What's complicated about it? She doesn't give a shit about Leo. They hate each other. You can't let her take him.
MIKE: OK. OK. Look, just go get ready for practice and I'll deal with it.
KYLE: Fine but I told her I'm staying with you guys until we leave. Kyle leaves. Terry just looks at Mike.

TERRY: Really? You want me to slap your face? Get you psyched up for the No. I really don't.
MIKE: No. I really don't.
ELEANOR: So do we.

Completely. And I'm afraid that can't change now that he's been declared incapacitated.
ELEANOR: Cindy, your father disinherited you from his will. Completely. And I'm afraid that can't change now that he's been declared incapacitated.
MIKE: Cindy, your father disinherited you from his will. Completely. And I'm afraid that can't change now that he's been declared incapacitated.

CINDY: What's to discuss? I'm not taking care of him if I'm not getting anything for it.

TERRY: Definitely. And wait till we get to the states! Atlantic City here we come, baby.
VIGMAN: Atlantic City. Fierce. Mike smiles but then his smile fades. Cindy Timmons is standing against the wall. She steps forward and Kyle sees
HER: Good luck, baby. Kyle keeps his head down and keeps walking. Mike looks shocked but also keeps walking.
CINDY: Good luck, baby. Kyle keeps his head down and keeps walking. Mike looks shocked but also keeps walking.
MIKE: Listen to me. One more win and we are going to the states. That's what counts. That's all that matters. You hear me? Kyle nods. Mike can tell that he's half listening.
REF: Warning. Red. One point.
MIKE: Kyle! Hey! Control! Control! Kyle looks at Mike and nods but his eyes are wild. The Ref blows the whistle and Kyle and the Other Wrestler lock up. They dance a bit and finally the Other Wrestler tries to wrap Kyle up. Kyle back pedals and then literally throws the Other Wrestler off the mat. The Ref has seen enough. He quickly issues Kyle his second warning and disqualifies him from the match. It's over. The Other Wrestler pops up and runs at Kyle. Kyle responds. The Coaches all intervene. It's a melee.
MIKE: How you doing?
KYLE: I'm sorry.
MIKE: Hey, it's alright. Mike puts his arm on his shoulder and Kyle starts to cry. Mike squeezes him.
KYLE: I don't want to go with her. I OK, pal. OK.
MIKE: OK, pal. OK.
MIKE: Why are you here?
CINDY: I wanted to see my son wrestle.
MIKE: Yeah, well your son had a pretty good chance to do something special in there. Maybe even change his life and that's gone now. I hope you're happy.
CINDY: That's not my fault.
MIKE: It isn't? Why do you think he lost his shit in there, huh?! What do you want, lady?
CINDY: I want my father.
MIKE: It didn't sound like that the other day. It sounded like you hated the You have no idea what my father used to be like. No idea! He wasn't like he is now! He treated me like shit and he was all I had!
CINDY: You have no idea what my father used to be like. No idea! He wasn't like he is now! He treated me like shit and he was all I had!
MIKE: So now you want to return the favor? Is that it?!
CINDY: I want that commission! That should be mine!
MIKE: And that's why you're doing all this? For fifteen hundred dollars a Isn't that why you did it? This stops Mike in his tracks.
CINDY: Isn't that why you did it? This stops Mike in his tracks.
MIKE: Alright, I'll tell you what. You want the commission? You can have it. And you don't even have to take Leo. I'll take care of him for free and I'll send you the check every month. On one condition.
CINDY: What's that?
MIKE: You leave Kyle here. With us. Until he finishes high school.
CINDY: I'm his mother. He belongs with me.
MIKE: Are you sure he feels that way?
CINDY: Don't tell me what my son feels! He's coming with me and there isn't anything you can do about that.
MIKE: Then you can't have that We'll see about that.
CINDY: We'll see about that.
MIKE: Yeah, we will. Mike turns and walks away.
CINDY: I want to see my son!
MIKE: Then call him! You have his number!
TERRY: We were right there, Mike. Right fucking there. And now we have nothing. Nothing! Terry screams. It's a primal scream. Mike just looks at him.
MIKE: You OK?
TERRY: Terry drinks. Mike watches him. Jackie pops out from the
JACKIE: Mike, your mom's here and dinner's almost ready. Have you seen Kyle?
MIKE: He's not in the basement?
JACKIE: I'll track him down.
TERRY: I'll track him down.
MIKE: Thanks, Terry.
TERRY: ( TO JACKIE )
JACKIE: Yeah, right. Terry goes inside. Jackie sits next to Mike.
MIKE: There's nothing to do. I can't stop her. She's gonna leave and she's gonna take Kyle and Leo with her.
JACKIE: And you don't think you'd beat her in court?
MIKE: No. I don't.
JACKIE: Why? It's so obvious she's just wants him for the money. Mike turns to Jackie. He wants to tell her but just can't.
MIKE: I just can't win this one, Jackie. Trust me. Jackie misinterprets Mike's guilt for pain. She backs off.
JACKIE: I do.
CINDY: Kyle, honey, come in. I'm so glad you came. She steps back and he enters.
KYLE: No. What do you want? She sits on the other facing him.
CINDY: I just wanted to say how sorry I was about the match and if I did anything to cause it then I will never forgive myself. I know how much wrestling means to you, baby.
KYLE: Is that why you called me. Just to tell me that?
CINDY: No. I also wanted to say that I'll do whatever you think is best for Leo. I promise.
KYLE: Then leave him here. Where he is.
CINDY: OK. I will. If that's what you want. But I have to be honest, I'm not sure that's what Leo wants.
KYLE: What do you mean?
CINDY: Here. Read this.
KYLE: What is it?
CINDY: It's the court transcript from when Leo was in court. My lawyer got it. Read the parts in yellow. See what it says. Kyle reluctantly reads it.
KYLE: This isn't real. The Judge told Leo he had to live there.
CINDY: No, honey. This is official from the court. It's what Mike said. Kyle reads it again.
KYLE: Cindy is caught of guard by the question.
CINDY: Why what?
KYLE: Why does he belong with us? Cindy judges her son's look and speaks from the heart.
CINDY: Because we deserve that money, Kyle. Not some lawyer. You're a big boy. You can understand that.
KYLE: Shut up! Shut up! She finally quiets. Terrified.
MIKE: OK. Thanks, Karen. I appreciate it. Jackie walks into the room.
JACKIE: He's not at Stemler's.
MIKE: He's not at Stemler's.
JACKIE: This is crazy, where could he be?
MIKE: I don't know, he's upset, maybe he went for a walk.
JACKIE: Well we should take a drive, your mom can stay with the kids. His phone rings. Jackie stops.
MIKE: Hello. Yes, this is him. What?
STAFF MEMBER: Sir, stay calm, we'll find him.
MIKE: Stay calm? You've lost my ward!
JACKIE: Mike! Calm down.
MIKE TERRY: Calm down?! We are gonna sue you guys, The Staff Member picks up the phone.
STAFF MEMBER: Look, he's definitely not on the premises. A lot of the time they just try to go home. We're about to go there. Mike and Jackie share a look and leave. Terry turns to some residents who are looking on.
TERRY: Hey folks, listen up! Watch out for each other.
TERRY: There's a light on.
JACKIE: It's got to be him. Do have the No. I didn't bring it with me. They arrive at the front door. Mike tries the knob. It's 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 105 Mike goes to edge of the porch, climbs up onto the railing and looks into the side window. Leo is sitting in a chair watching TV.
MIKE: No. I didn't bring it with me. They arrive at the front door. Mike tries the knob. It's 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 105 Mike goes to edge of the porch, climbs up onto the railing and looks into the side window. Leo is sitting in a chair watching TV.
JACKIE: What's he doing?
MIKE: Watching TV.
TERRY: What's he watching?
JACKIE: Who cares?
MIKE: Leo? Hey Leo? Mike knocks on the window. Leo doesn't register it.
TERRY: This is freaking spooky. Mike climbs down back onto the porch.
MIKE: I have a key back at the office. I could go get it.
JACKIE: Is he OK?
MIKE: He seems it. He's just sitting 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 106 Suddenly the door opens. Leo is standing there.
LEO: Come on in. Leo walks away. They all follow him.
LEO: Come on in. Leo walks away. They all follow him.
TERRY: OK. That is very creepy.
MIKE: You OK, Leo? Leo just watches TV.
JACKIE MIKE: Kyle? You took Leo?
MIKE: Have you lost your mind?! We've been worried sick about him!
JACKIE: About both of you!
KYLE: You don't have to worry about us. Kyle walks out of the room.
TERRY: OK. That's super spooky. Just INT. LEO POPLAR'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS. Kyle walks into the kitchen, he turns off a pot of boiling water and strains some pasta.
MIKE: Kyle, What the hell are you doing?
KYLE: ( VERY CALMLY )
MIKE: Have you lost your mind?
KYLE: Kyle, why did you do this? Please just tell us. Leo needs to be in a This is where he belongs.
JACKIE: Kyle, why did you do this? Please just tell us. Leo needs to be in a This is where he belongs.
KYLE: This is where he belongs.
JACKIE: Kyle he needs to be at Oak Knoll.
MIKE: Kyle, we talked about this.
KYLE: Yeah. We did! Listen to this. Kyle takes a piece of paper out of his pocket.
JACKIE: What is that? Jackie takes it and looks at it.
KYLE: It's from the court.
JACKIE: Where did you get this?
KYLE: From my mother.
JACKIE: Mike can't answer. Kyle's seen enough.
KYLE: You're just like her. He runs out. They all give chase.
MIKE: Hey. Hey, Kyle. Kyle keeps walking.
KYLE: Leave me alone!
MIKE: Kyle please.
KYLE: Don't touch me! Mike deflects Kyle and Kyle spills to the ground.
TERRY: Oh shit. Kyle gets up and starts to circle Mike. Mike has no choice but reciprocate.
MIKE: Would you let me explain?!
KYLE: Explain what? How you lied to me? How you lied to Leo? Kyle head pumps. Mike takes the bait and jumps back.
MIKE TERRY: Kyle wait. Watch the head fake!
MIKE: Kyle I don't want to wrestle you.
JACKIE TERRY: Kyle, stop for a minute. Keep your hands out, Mike.
JACKIE: Terry, stop it!
TERRY: I'm just trying to help.
JACKIE: You're not helping. Kyle head fakes again but this time he's in. Before Mike knows what hits him, he's on his back.
MIKE TERRY: Ow! Oh shit.
MIKE: I'm trying to stop it!
TERRY: Sit out Mike! Sit out!
JACKIE MIKE: Shut up, Terry! Kyle, stop it! Mike gets up to hands and knees but Kyle drives him hard to the ground.
JACKIE: Would you stop coaching and break that up! Terry rushes in and tries to pull Kyle off but he's lost it. Finally, he wraps his arms around Kyle and pulls him off. Kyle spins free and fronts Terry. Terry immediately puts up his hands.
TERRY: I'm the ref. I'm just the ref! Kyle turns and runs off.
JACKIE: Kyle! Stop! Please! He doesn't stop. Jackie turns to Mike.
MIKE: Yeah, it is. Mike gets up.
JACKIE: So why'd you move him if he wanted to stay here.
MIKE: Because it would have been too much work to leave him here. I couldn't have done it.
JACKIE: Then you shouldn't have taken him.
MIKE: I had to, alright?
JACKIE: Because I needed the money! We needed the money.
MIKE: Because I needed the money! We needed the money.
JACKIE: You moved an old man out of his house to make money? Have you lost your freaking mind?
MIKE: No! I just didn't think it would get this complicated.
JACKIE: Really? Or you just didn't think you'd get caught? This stops Mike in his tracks. He can't answer. Jackie turns and walks away.
MIKE: Jack! Jack, where are you going?
JACKIE: She walks away.
KYLE: Hello. Hello. Mom? She's not there. He hangs up. Kyle starts to put on his Did your mom just crank call you?
STEMLER: Did your mom just crank call you?
KYLE: 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 112 So you and Coach Mike get in a fight because you lost?
STEMLER: So you and Coach Mike get in a fight because you lost?
KYLE: No. We got in a fight because he's an asshole.
STEMLER: Yeah, really, Stem.
KYLE: Yeah, really, Stem.
STEMLER: Well I'm sure he'll make it up to you, bro. You're the best wrestler he's ever had. I mean he's always been cool to me and I suck. This comment lands with Kyle.
MIKE: Hey Leo.
LEO: I fell asleep. I'm sorry.
MIKE: I fell asleep. I'm sorry.
LEO: Sorry for what? That's a big question. Mike cuts to the chase.
MIKE: You want to go home?
LEO: INT. MIKE AND JACKIE'S HOUSE - LATER. Jackie is sitting with Stella and a cup of coffee. The front door opens and closes. Mike walks into the kitchen.
JACKIE: Hi. Is he here?
MIKE: Hi. Is he here?
JACKIE: No. He slept at Stemler's. How about you?
MIKE: Oak Knoll.
JACKIE: So what are you going to do?
MIKE: I have to go court.
JACKIE: You can't. You told the Judge you were keeping Leo at home.
MIKE: I know.
JACKIE: So then tell her you changed your mind. No one can question that.
MIKE: I can't, Jack.
JACKIE: Why not?
MIKE: Because it's not true.
JACKIE: Well I'm glad your done lying now, just in time to lose your practice. That's how we survive, Mike. Your family. You ever think of that?
MIKE: Yeah. All the time. Jackie quickly crosses to the sink. She starts to clean. She breaks something.
JACKIE: She braces herself against the sink and exhales. Mike just watches her.
MIKE: I'm sorry, Jack. I really am.
JACKIE: I know. A noise from the basement. Mike heads down the stairs.
JACKIE: Hey Kyle. How'd you get down here?
KYLE: The window.
JACKIE: Are you hungry? I was gonna make some pancakes.
KYLE: No. I'm leaving. I just came to get my shit. They share a look and walk over to Kyle.
MIKE: Kyle, listen, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
KYLE: I know, Mike, you're sorry. Everyone's always sorry.
MIKE: I moved Leo back home, Kyle. And I'm gonna fight to keep him there.
KYLE: It's too late. You'll lose. My mother's gonna take him.
MIKE: Maybe but I'm still gonna try.
KYLE: So what?! You want me to forgive you now? Is that it, Mike?!
MIKE: No. I just want you to give me another chance. That's all I'm Mike's sincerity is undeniable. Kyle looks to Jackie. They connect. Kyle shakes his head, turns around, and then throws his bag.
KYLE: This is bullshit! Mike looks at Jackie.
MIKE: Hey, Kyle, listen -
KYLE: I want to be alone.
MIKE: ( Without looking at them )

ELEANOR: Mike turns. Eleanor approaches.
MIKE: Hi Eleanor.
ELEANOR: Can I talk to you?
MIKE: Mike and Eleanor step to the side. She looks at Mike.
ELEANOR: You know the transcript alone is enough to hang you.

MIKE: Is that it?
ELEANOR: No. My client would like to talk to Mike and Eleanor walk over to Cindy. She is barely holding it Hi Cindy.

CINDY: And you'll send me the checks?
MIKE: Every month.
CINDY: You take good care of him.
MIKE: We will. Cindy nods.
CINDY: I want to say goodbye. Mike turns and waves Kyle over. Kyle look to Jackie who gives him the OK. He walks over as Mike steps away. He just looks at his mother. She gently touches his face. He doesn't move. Everyone looks on as Cindy says a few words to Kyle, hugs him hard and then quickly turns and walks away. Kyle watches her EXT. MIKE AND JACKIE'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING.
