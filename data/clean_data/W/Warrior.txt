WARRIOR: Written by
PADDY: Tommy gives a drunken, crooked smile.
TOMMY: I was just passing through. Figured why not have a belt with the old Father and son look at each other. It's obvious it's been a long, long time. Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car.
PADDY: ( patting car hood ) Yeah, she's hanging in there.
TOMMY: Well, you always did take good care of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of Paddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy.
PADDY: She did. But that's not for me anymore, Tommy.
TOMMY: What? You change brands? Paddy shakes his head. Tommy looks at him. Paddy Conlon not drinking? What gives?
PADDY: C'mon, let's go inside. Paddy pats his son on the back and heads for the door as a confused Tommy follows.
TOMMY: I like what you've done with the PADDY ( O.S. ) Appreciate that. The sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home. He glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca lounge chair.
TOMMY: There's not much of a woman's touch around here.
TOMMY: Yeah? Must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays. Tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a series of old PHOTOGRAPHS lining the walls as Paddy walks into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old wicker tray. Tommy looks at him, incredulous.
PADDY: Here you go.
TOMMY: Coffee? You haven't seen a guy in 14 years and you're not gonna have a drink with him?
PADDY: I told you, I'm off it. I'm coming up on a thousand days.
TOMMY: C'mon, just one drink.
PADDY: Tommy shrugs. Takes another pull from his bottle and turns back to the photos. He takes them in.
TOMMY: So you found God, huh? That's awesome. Mom kept calling for him, but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks. Who knew? Paddy sips his coffee. Says nothing. Tommy keeps pressing.
PADDY: I know.
TOMMY: Oh, you know? What do you know? Do you know it wasn't enough just to drive west to get away from you? When we hit the water we drove north, too.
PADDY: When I got sober I hired a man to find you.
TOMMY: ( taking a swig ) Is that one of the 12 steps? Or does a guy like you get 24?
PADDY: Just the 12.
TOMMY: Did your guy tell you what you needed to know?
PADDY: Just that your mother died in Tacoma. And you were in the Marines. That was all. That was That's too bad. You could've gotten some good details. Tommy plops himself into a recliner. Glances at the coffee table, where a stack of classic books on tape sits. CRIME AND
TOMMY: That's too bad. You could've gotten some good details. Tommy plops himself into a recliner. Glances at the coffee table, where a stack of classic books on tape sits. CRIME AND
PADDY: I'm sorry, Tommy.
TOMMY: It's good to know you're sorry, Pop. Goes a long way. Paddy chokes up. Tommy looks at him. Closes his eyes.
TESS: What's going on here?
BRENDAN: Well, I'm not sure, but I think Daddy is now a princess. Tess laughs. Brendan looks at her with a "Help me out here" Em, you want to open your presents? The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents." Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around. Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest.
TESS: Em, you want to open your presents? The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents." Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around. Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest.
BRENDAN: It's her birthday. Tess turns the video camera toward Brendan again. He couldn't look more ridiculous. And he obviously didn't clear the gift with his wife. He grins at her as she lowers the camera.
TESS: ( TEASING )
TESS: Hey babe, I'm late. Mom's saying goodbye to the girls. She's gotta get on the road. They've been fed. They just need a bath.
BRENDAN: I'm on it.
TESS: Can you get them down at a reasonable time tonight? They're Brendan kisses Tess. Looks at her outfit.
BRENDAN: Where's the rest of that skirt?
TESS: Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight you give me a call, okay?
BRENDAN: Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight you give me a call, okay?
TESS: ( off his cut ) Yeah. Just like you gave me a call when those Temple frat boys decided to smash up your face.
BRENDAN: I told you, most nights I sit on the stool and grade papers, but every now and then I need some Alright, well wait up for me tonight. I'll see what I can do about that. Tess smiles flirtatiously and and heads for the car.
TESS: Alright, well wait up for me tonight. I'll see what I can do about that. Tess smiles flirtatiously and and heads for the car.
BRENDAN: Promises, promises.
TOMMY: Fitzy still own this?
FENROY: Don't know no Fitzy. Colt Boyd owns this gym. Fenroy goes back to his computer. Tommy stands there. Notices a Sparta POSTER on the wall reading: "THE WAR ON THE SHORE.
HISTORY!": FENROY ( CONT'D )
TOMMY: How's it work here?
FENROY: Thirty five a month with locker. We're open at 7, lights out at 11. You wanna join?
TOMMY: Fenroy grabs a pencil and an index card and puts them on the counter in front of Tommy.
FENROY: Put your name and contact info on the card.
BRENDAN: Whoa whoa whoa! There's a lesson in this too, OK? Listen up. So we have a body at rest, and you have the bat which needs
TITO: Acceleration, right. If you have enough acceleration, you have might have a chance to break the body at rest. OK. Go ahead. Brendan, sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face, watches as Tito brings the bat down on the wood. As it CRACKS in half, the other students cheer wildly. Tito smiles and leans the bat against a blackboard with "NEWTON'S 2nd LAW OF MOTION" printed on it.
BRENDAN: Acceleration, right. If you have enough acceleration, you have might have a chance to break the body at rest. OK. Go ahead. Brendan, sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face, watches as Tito brings the bat down on the wood. As it CRACKS in half, the other students cheer wildly. Tito smiles and leans the bat against a blackboard with "NEWTON'S 2nd LAW OF MOTION" printed on it.
NASH: Force equals mass times acceleration. We got it.
BRENDAN: Alright. The third law A black student, STEPHON, looks up from his desk.
STEPHON: How many laws this dude got?
BRENDAN: ( LAUGHING )
KC: Mr. C, I put it away. The class busts on KC as Brendan walks back to his desk and sits on top of it. It's clear from the vibe in the room that he's a very popular teacher. Then the BELL rings.
BRENDAN: Alright, before you go, I have your tests from last week.
MAD DOG: Where do you find these girls? Colt climbs into the ring and looks at the fallen fighter. Glances at Mad Dog.
COLT BOYD: We got a tournament coming up. You gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh?
TOMMY: Yo, I'll fight him. Colt turns around and looks at Tommy. As does Mad Dog, who smiles down at him from inside the ring.
COLT BOYD: Do me a favor guy, go back to your bag. We don't need anybody else getting hurt. G'head. Take a walk. Tommy walks back to his bag. Mad Dog smiles. Looks at Tommy's Yo Rock, what happened? You leave Mick and Paulie at home today? Tommy stops. Walks back to the ring as Fenroy approaches.
MAD DOG: Yo Rock, what happened? You leave Mick and Paulie at home today? Tommy stops. Walks back to the ring as Fenroy approaches.
FENROY: ( TO COLT )
COLT BOYD: Then go through the list. Get me Joe Bones.
TOMMY: ( TO COLT )
COLT BOYD: You ever fought before?
TOMMY: Colt studies Tommy. Sees he's serious. Gives in.
COLT BOYD: ( TO FENROY )
FENROY: All good.
COLT BOYD: What's your name?
TOMMY: COLT BOYD
COLT BOYD: You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tommy.
TOMMY: Sure, no problem.
COLT BOYD: Come on in. Colt Boyd waves Tommy into the ring. Mad Dog's entourage starts whispering amongst themselves. Snickering at what lays in wait for Tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped out of the ring. A TRAINER tapes Tommy's hands and gives him some MMA gloves. He slips them on, then at the sound of a BUZZER he starts moving toward Mad Dog, who smirks at Tommy's aggression and then starts circling him. Tommy nails him with a front kick to the chest. Grimes staggers back and shakes it off.
MAD DOG: Gonna be a hero? Alright. He crouches down, gets serious. He throws a right. Blocked. A leg kick. Blocked. Tommy snaps his head with a jab. Then he does it again. And again. Then he DECKS HIM with a hard right, sending Mad Dog to the canvas to the shock of his entourage and Colt Boyd. Fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring. Within moments everyone in the gym stops what they're doing and watches as Tommy grabs the back of Mad Dog's head, hauls it down, and launches knee after knee into his face. Tommy starts throwing Mad Dog around like a rag doll, striking him with vicious punches and kicks, as Fenroy pulls out his CELL PHONE and starts filming the action. As Colt Boyd screams at Mad Dog to cover up, Tommy shoves him against the ropes and blasts away. Tommy continues to pound. It's a full-fledged beating going on in there. Finally, he crushes Mad Dog with a vicious left hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes, UNCONSCIOUS. SILENCE in the gym. What the hell just happened here? The entourage rushes to Mad Dog's aid, but he's out cold. Colt Boyd looks on in disbelief as Tommy walks across the ring and approaches him.
TOMMY: You owe me two hundred bucks.
DAN TAYLOR: This is the new appraisal figure, and this is how it effects the monthly. As you can see, that puts you upside down on your mortgage. That's the problem. It's the country that did the assessment, not the bank. So, the numbers are what they are, Mr. Conlon.
BRENDAN: DAN TAYLOR
DAN TAYLOR: The numbers are what they are, Brendan. I mean, you're a Math teacher, you can appreciate that.
BRENDAN: I teach Physics.
DAN TAYLOR: Physics. OK. But the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures. According to these figures, you're upside down on your mortgage
BRENDAN: You said that three times already. I get that. But I'm asking you if there's something else you can do. Not the bank, you. Can you shift things around, restructure
DAN TAYLOR: Well, you've already refinanced Because you advised us to do that.
BRENDAN: Because you advised us to do that.
DAN TAYLOR: I presented you with that option. It was your choice.
BRENDAN: We had that conversation. I was paying medical bills. Is that in your file? Taylor looks at Brendan. Takes him a second to remember.
DAN TAYLOR: Oh, right. Sorry. Your Heart, right. ( off stack of files on desk ) Lot of stories.
BRENDAN: DAN TAYLOR
DAN TAYLOR: Heart, right. ( off stack of files on desk ) Lot of stories.
BRENDAN: So my option is I've got no options? You're not even gonna try to help me?
DAN TAYLOR: I am trying, Brendan. Look, I can get you 90 days to get even
BRENDAN: 90 days is not enough. My wife and I have three jobs between us and that doesn't cut it. So, what do you suggest?
DAN TAYLOR: Let me ask you a question: have you considered bankruptcy? It's a viable option. There's no shame in it these days.
BRENDAN: That's not how I do things.
DAN TAYLOR: Well, then you're looking at Brendan gets up and storms out of the office.
COLT BOYD: How you doin,' sir? I'm looking for Tommy Riordan. Paddy registers the name "Riordan."
PADDY: COLT BOYD
COLT BOYD: Tommy Riordan? My name's Colt Boyd.
PADDY: What business you got with Tommy?
COLT BOYD: None yet. That's why I'm here. I manage fighters. Colt looks at Paddy. Jams his hands in his pockets. He's obviously waiting for an invite inside. It doesn't come.
PADDY: Conlon. Name's Conlon. And anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself.
COLT BOYD: I'm just looking for some general information here.
PADDY: Like I said, anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him Look, I don't mean to interrupt your night. He put this address down when he signed up at the gym.
COLT BOYD: Look, I don't mean to interrupt your night. He put this address down when he signed up at the gym.
PADDY: He doesn't live here. Paddy closes the door on a frustrated Colt.
ANNOUNCER: It's time for our next contest! Introducing first, fighting out of the red corner, from Ripley, West Virginia, please welcome Mike "The Mutilator" Moore! Some hollers from the crowd.
A: Lo and behold, there's a shirtless Brendan standing in the corner of the ring wearing a pair of shorts. On his right shoulder, an elaborate TATTOO of the CONLON FAMILY CREST.
REFEREE: Fighters to the center! I want you to obey my commands at all times. If you have no questions, touch gloves, back up, and wait for my signal. Come out fighting! Brendan reaches out to touch gloves with Mike Moore, but his opponent snubs him and storms back to his corner. He means business. Brendan, looking less sure of himself, retreats to his corner.
PROMOTER: Nice fight. Two more wins and you take home the bacon.
TESS: ( SLEEPY )
BRENDAN: I'm not bouncing at a club.
TESS: What do you mean you're not She looks at him. Looks at the money. Puts it together.
BRENDAN: I went in to apply. They were only paying nine bucks an hour. Then I saw a sign for this other thing. Tess can't believe what she's hearing.
OF OPTIONS: ( FURIOUS ) ( BEAT )
TESS: ( FURIOUS ) ( BEAT )
BRENDAN: We're not giving up the house. This is our home. We're not going
BACKWARDS: Tess reaches up and touches his battered face. Calms herself down. Embraces her husband.
TESS: We'll figure it out. But this is what we're not going back to.
PADDY: You wanted to talk?
TOMMY: ( BEAT )
PADDY: That right?
TOMMY: Don't play babe in the woods with me. I know that guy from the gym came to see you.
PADDY: Colt Boyd? I didn't tell him anything, Tommy.
TOMMY: We wouldn't be sitting here now if you did.
PADDY: What about Colt Boyd?
TOMMY: What about him? I told him I don't train with people I don't know.
PADDY: Ah, the devil you know.
TOMMY: Excuse me?
PADDY: The devil you know is better than the devil you don't. Tommy looks at him. Grins for the first time.
TOMMY: ( ANGRY )
PADDY: Alright. Alright. But you get something through your skull, too. You called me. So don't go threatening to walk every five minutes. And since this is about training, you dump whatever it is you need to dump as far as those pills are concerned. I don't want to see `em. Tommy gives him a hard look, but the old man doesn't shy In fact, hand `em over right now.
TITO: My brother said he was at the strip club and saw Mr. C fighting MMA-
NASH: What's MMA?
STEPHON: Mixed Martial Arts. Like, different styles of fighting.
KC: Your brother's a liar. Brendan enters the room. The kids look at him. Holy shit. It's true.
BRENDAN: Take your seats. Brendan puts his bag down on his desk and faces the class. He is not amused by the murmuring in there.
TITO: Yo, Mr. C. My brother was at the titty bar last night and said you was choking brothers out. What's up? Is it true?
STEPHON: Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, did you really work on some fools or something?
KC: You have to tell us. Before Brendan can answer, he sees PRINCIPAL JOE ZITO ( 50s ) gesturing to him through the window of the classroom. Zito taps his watch and points. Come see me after class.
BRENDAN: C'mon, it's not as bad as it looks.
JOE ZITO: Are you being literal or figurative? Because literally it looks bad. And figuratively it looks even worse. The superintendent's coming by in a few minutes. So gimme a little help here, Brendan. Can you explain to me what the hell you were doing?
BRENDAN: I need the money, Joe.
JOE ZITO: Yeah, but we can't have this. This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's for Christ's sake. Zito stands up and runs his hands across his head.
BRENDAN: Actually, I used to be one of those Zito looks at Brendan. Puzzled.
JOE ZITO: Yeah, I guess you did. Zito sits back down.
BRENDAN: Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just
JOE ZITO: Listen, the school district's not going to tolerate school teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.
BRENDAN: It was the parking lot of a strip Wherever it was, you can't be doing it, alright? I mean this is a seriousshit, he's here. Zito sees the SUPERINTENDENT enter the foyer outside his office. He's looking none too pleased.
JOE ZITO: Wherever it was, you can't be doing it, alright? I mean this is a seriousshit, he's here. Zito sees the SUPERINTENDENT enter the foyer outside his office. He's looking none too pleased.
BRENDAN: What are we gonna do?
JOE ZITO: You say yes, sir. And you say no, sir. And you say it'll never happen again, sir. And then we just pray to God he's in a good mood.
UFC?: Brendan nods. Joe shakes his head. Impressed.
TESS: What are you doing?
BRENDAN: ( OFF PIANO )
TESS: They're gonna review your case at the end of the semester, but until then you're suspended without pay. Joe gave me the number of his How the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney? Tess crouches down and enters the tiny room. She sits on the He talked to me for free. As a favor to Joe.
BRENDAN: How the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney? Tess crouches down and enters the tiny room. She sits on the He talked to me for free. As a favor to Joe.
TESS: He talked to me for free. As a favor to Joe.
BRENDAN: That was nice.
TESS: He said there's no precedent for this. You'll be back by next Next semester? Tess sighs. They sit in silence. There are no easy solutions. Finally, Brendan speaks up.
BRENDAN: Next semester? Tess sighs. They sit in silence. There are no easy solutions. Finally, Brendan speaks up.
TESS: You're gonna put yourself through this over and over, for five hundred bucks a pop?
BRENDAN: Some of them pay a little more than I would have had to bounce for a month to make what I made in two hours last night. Brendan looks at his wife.
TESS: What are we gonna tell the girls?
BRENDAN: It'll be fine. I'll just leave the house as usual, except now I'll be going to the gym. They look at each other. No choice. This is the plan.
PADDY: ( SINGING )
TOMMY: Yeah, I'll tell ya something. You can take that thing back to where you found it. And you can leave the coffee in the pot. I can pour that myself. I can wake myself up, too. Paddy's stung but covers it amiably.
PADDY: OK. Hurt my knees coming up and down those stairs anyway.
MARINE #1: Damn dude, that's brutal. LANCE CORPORAL MARK BRADFORD ( 20s ) walks up to see what the commotion is all about.
BRADFORD: What's that?
MARINE #2: "Mad Dog" Grimes gettin' tuned up by some dude in a gym in Who's "Mad Dog" Grimes?
BRADFORD: Who's "Mad Dog" Grimes?
MARINE #2: Shit, Bradford. The stuff you don't know amazes me.
BRADFORD: Wait, rewind that. One of the Marines rewinds the video. Bradford looks at the image in disbelief, then races out of the tent.
BRADFORD: AV, I need to see the tape!
AV: What tape?
BRADFORD: The tape. AV drops his cards, rushes to his bunk, pulls out a steel container loaded with VIDEOTAPES and sifts through it. They are labeled by day and month. AV finds what he's looking for, loads it into the camera, and hits PLAY.
BRADFORD: AV holds the "Pause" button down as Bradford looks at the screen in disbelief. It's definitely Tommy.
FRANK: Let the music sink in to you. This is Beethoven. Breathe. Breathe. As Frank teaches, Brendan walks in the door. The great trainer notices him and walks over.
BRENDAN: Liking the place, Frank.
FRANK: Thank you, brother. ( off Brazilian fighter ) You see this beast? Marco Santos? I'm training him for Sparta.
BRENDAN: Amazing, man.
FRANK: Come on back. The two head for the offices at the back of the gym.
FRANK: You look good, brother. How're the Good. Good. I had another little one. Rosie.
BRENDAN: Good. Good. I had another little one. Rosie.
FRANK: I know. Johnny C. told me she was in the hospital for a bit. I was gonna call, but then time went by. I don't know. I'm a piece of shit. I should have called.
BRENDAN: It's alright.
FRANK: No, Brendan. I'm sorry.
BRENDAN: It's all good. She's good now. Frank looks at his old friend. Smiles warmly.
FRANK: It's great to see you, man. So everything's going good?
BRENDAN: Yeah. Well, I've got a little problem. The guys at the bank want to take my house away. That's kind of why I came to see you, actually. Frank considers what he's hearing.
FRANK: I've got most of my dough tied up in this joint, but how much do you I didn't come here for a loan, I was hoping you'd train me.
BRENDAN: I didn't come here for a loan, I was hoping you'd train me.
FRANK: Train you for what?
BRENDAN: I want to get back in the cage. Frank starts smiling. Leans back in his seat. Then he sees Brendan is not smiling with him.
FRANK: You're serious?
BRENDAN: I just won an event the other Ah, you won an event. ( off bruised face ) That's what this is. Let me guess, it was in a parking lot. DJ from the local radio station. Couple of ring card girls you wouldn't bang on a dare. Am I right? Brendan smiles.
FRANK: Ah, you won an event. ( off bruised face ) That's what this is. Let me guess, it was in a parking lot. DJ from the local radio station. Couple of ring card girls you wouldn't bang on a dare. Am I right? Brendan smiles.
BRENDAN: Ish. Brendan. I love you. I do. But why would I train you? When you were in shape and on the right side of 30 you were barely a .500 fighter. You never listened to me. You never listened to anyone. These guys are animals. I mean, you're a teacher, right? What're you gonna do? You're gonna come down here for a couple days a week after detention? You're gonna skip out of the girl's volleyball game early?
FRANK: Ish. Brendan. I love you. I do. But why would I train you? When you were in shape and on the right side of 30 you were barely a .500 fighter. You never listened to me. You never listened to anyone. These guys are animals. I mean, you're a teacher, right? What're you gonna do? You're gonna come down here for a couple days a week after detention? You're gonna skip out of the girl's volleyball game early?
BRENDAN: I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue. The parking lot thing kinda got me suspended. I need to keep working the smokers.
FRANK: Tess know about this? ( off Brendan's nod ) Yeah? `Cause the last time you fought, I got read the riot act sitting in a hospital waiting room. You remember that?
BRENDAN: No. I was unconscious. The two friends share a laugh.
FRANK: She's not gonna come down here with the two puppies, screaming at It's not gonna happen. Come on. Whattya say, Frank?
BRENDAN: It's not gonna happen. Come on. Whattya say, Frank?
FRANK: What do I say? What am I gonna say to you? No? I mean, all my time is wrapped up with Marco. You come down, I'll throw you in the rotation, you spar with these guys, no problem. But I can't promise you much more than that, Brendan.
BRENDAN: That's all I need. Brendan stands up. Shakes Frank's hand.
FRANK: Let me know when you're coming Well, I'm just gonna go get my stuff from the car.
BRENDAN: ( WALKING AWAY )
FRANK: Brendan puts his dukes up and smiles as Frank shakes his EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - NIGHT Brendan pulls into the driveway of his modest home, gets out of his Camry, and looks to the street, where Paddy stands outside his Olds, leaning on the passenger door. Brendan carries a gym bag and wears work out clothes. He's clearly not happy to see Paddy, who stands there, uncomfortable and heavy hearted in the light of the street
PADDY: Hey, Brendan. It's me, Pop.
BRENDAN: What're you doing here?
PADDY: I have some news for you.
BRENDAN: Something wrong with your hands? Paddy shakes his head, unsure what he means.
PADDY: Yeah, I forgot
BRENDAN: Phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable. Paddy holds his hands out, palms down.
PADDY: Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my hands so steady? Have you?
BRENDAN: I'm going inside.
PADDY: I've got a thousand days. A thousand days sober today.
BRENDAN: Well, that's great, Pop. But it doesn't change anything.
PADDY: What do you mean it doesn't change anything? Have a heart, Brendan. Paddy's words set Brendan off. A side of him we haven't seen before emerges. He approaches his father fiercely.
BRENDAN: You listen to me. You take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road. Run it out on someone who doesn't know you like I C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we could break bread. Open some lines of communication.
PADDY: C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we could break bread. Open some lines of communication.
BRENDAN: You got two lines of communication, the telephone and the post office. Just because you decide it's a special day, it doesn't make it one for me. I got a wife and kids inside and they're waiting for me, so I don't have time for whatever this is.
PADDY: I know you got a wife and kids in there. I got a grand-daughter I haven't seen in three years and another I haven't even ever met.
BRENDAN: Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do you remember having anything to do with that? Paddy nods. Casts his eyes down in shame.
PADDY: Tommy's back. Brendan stops in his tracks. He turns and looks at his Dad.
BRENDAN: Tommy's in Pittsburgh?
PADDY: He came to see me.
BRENDAN: He came to see you?
PADDY: He's over at the house. We're doing a little training at Fitzy's. Remember Fitzy's? It ain't Fitzy's Brendan walks closer. Incredulous.
BRENDAN: You and Tommy are training Paddy nods.
PADDY: Riordan. He's using your mother's maiden name now.
BRENDAN: I know what her name is.
PADDY: I thought you'd want to know he's back. That's why I drove all the way over here.
BRENDAN: I thought you came to break bread over a thousand days?
PADDY: That too. Brendan looks at him. Considers.
BRENDAN: Did he say if he wants to see me?
PADDY: He doesn't say much. He's just not that happy kid he was.
BRENDAN: Wow, look at you. Mister inside Paddy frowns.
PADDY: What's that?
BRENDAN: You came to gloat.
PADDY: I did not come to gloat. I came to get my son back.
BRENDAN: Well, there you go. You got your son back.
PADDY: I'm talking about you, Bren
BRENDAN: You got your son back. Brendan starts to walk away, then turns around again.
PADDY: Ah, Brendan. I was a drunk. I mean, you know. I'm sorry.
BRENDAN: Forget it. You were always a front runner. You never had any interest in underdogs. But I was your son.
PADDY: You are my son.
BRENDAN: Am I?
PADDY: Yeah, you are. I'm just asking you to find just a little space in your heart to forgive me.
BRENDAN: Yeah. Alright. I forgive you. But I do not trust you. Tell Tommy this is where I am if he wants to see Alright. But they're not different things. You've gotta trust to
PADDY: Alright. But they're not different things. You've gotta trust to
FORGIVE: Goodnight, Pop.
BRENDAN: Goodnight, Pop.
PADDY: My God, is that Emily? Boy, she's grown, Brendan. Is that Rosie? Brendan keeps walking. Opens his door to step inside.
ROSIE: Daddy, who is that?
BRENDAN: Just some nice old man. Brendan closes the door, leaving the heartbroken Paddy alone in the yard.
JON ANIK: Huge news breaking here at ESPN. Koba is coming to America and will fight at Sparta. Universally considered to be the greatest pound for pound fighter that ever lived, the mighty, mythical Russian has never fought on U.S. soil in his legendary career. Mad Dog Grimes trains furiously under the watchful eye of Colt Boyd. When Colt sees Tommy approaching, he turns his attention away from Mad Dog.
COLT BOYD: Tommy? Got some news for ya. I got you into Sparta. Took some doing, but I made it happen.. ( off no reaction from Tommy ) Thank you and 10 percent is Tommy heads up the stairs toward the locker room without acknowledging Colt, though he does allow a small smile to crease his lips.
PILAR: Pilar. It's Tommy.
TOMMY: Pilar. It's Tommy.
PILAR: Tommy! Dios mio! I can't believe it! How are you?
TOMMY: Good good. How you doin'?
PILAR: OK. You know me, Tommy.
TOMMY: How're things? Kids are good?
PILAR: They're good. Maria's getting so big. She looks more like Manny every day.
TOMMY: How's little man?
PILAR: He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy. Takes care of his sister. He's a great kid. Everyone's good.
TOMMY: You know, Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute what I promised you. What I promised Manny. I've got an opportunity coming up to help you guys out. To take care of you guys.
PILAR: Whatever you can do, Tommy. I know Manny would really appreciate it. You worry too much. It's OK. We're hanging in there.
FRANK: No he did not tap you! Physics teacher! That's the best in the world there, son.
BRENDAN: You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite?
FRANK: Nah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta call the boys and break the news. I'll call you tomorrow. Frank heads off through the lot. Brendan reaches his car, stops, considers. Calls out to Frank while jogging toward Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a great time. And it's too bad about Marco. But what about me? Brendan looks hopefully at Frank, who shakes his head as he begins to open the door of his `70 Ford Bronco.
BRENDAN: Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a great time. And it's too bad about Marco. But what about me? Brendan looks hopefully at Frank, who shakes his head as he begins to open the door of his `70 Ford Bronco.
FRANK: You talking about Sparta? Brendan, please. You got a better chance of starting a boy band. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
BRENDAN: It's a grand prix tournament. Which means anything can happen. You know that as well as I do. Frank looks at him. Sees how serious Brendan is.
FRANK: That's what I'm afraid of.
BRENDAN: Frank, I need this. You're real tight with those guys. You call them, they'll listen to you.
FRANK: You realize what you're asking me to do here, Brendan? We go down to AC and you get tapped out in five seconds, how does that benefit either one of us?
BRENDAN: That's not gonna happen.
FRANK: Not gonna happen. Wish I had a nickel for every time I heard that.
BRENDAN: ( SMILING )
FRANK: I'll make a call. Brendan grins and walks back toward his car.
BRENDAN: I love my coach!
TESS: Really? So that's your decision? You decided? `Cause I really enjoyed that conversation we just had about making that decision Brendan doesn't say anything. Knows she's right. And that he's about to get laid into.
BRENDAN: It's a lot of money, Tess.
TESS: I don't give a shit about the money, Brendan. I told you that. We're gonna end up cashing in your life insurance policy before we pick up that prize money.
BRENDAN: You don't think I can do it.
TESS: I think you can get killed.
BRENDAN: I'm not gonna get killed.
TESS: Fine, you're not going to get killed. But can you promise me you're not going to get hurt? You're not gonna end up in the hospital? You're not gonna end up paralyzed? We'll have no prize money. No house. Payments for
HOSPITAL BILLS: Tess, I can promise you this: if I don't try, they're gonna take the house. How's that for a promise? No response from Tess, who has tears in her eyes.
BRENDAN: Tess, I can promise you this: if I don't try, they're gonna take the house. How's that for a promise? No response from Tess, who has tears in her eyes.
TESS: I'm not gonna watch you fight again. I'm not.
CALLEN: J.J., you've made a fortune with your hedge funds, yet you turned your back on Wall Street and dedicated your life to making Sparta happen. Tell us, why is this tournament so important to you?
J.J. RILEY: Growing up, we all wanted to know who the toughest kid in the neighborhood was, right? I wanna know who the toughest man on the planet is. That's why I put this together, that's what all these people are here to see, and come Saturday night, that's what we're gonna find out.
SHERIDAN: Thank you, J.J. And here's something fans never thought they'd see: Koba is here! The legend arriving to fight on U.S. soil for the very first time. The great and mighty KOBA emerges from a white stretch limo, trailed by his ENTOURAGE of tough-looking RUSSIANS. FLASHBULBS pop. REPORTERS swarm. It looks like a movie premiere out there and Koba's the star.
FRANK: Hey. Where'd you go? You can't leave me like that. They wanna talk to you, not me. Brendan looks past Frank. Tommy has risen and headed toward the exit, trailed by Paddy, who calls after him.
PADDY: ON TV SCREEN: MARK BRADFORD PEERS INTO A HAND-HELD CAMERA IN IRAQ AND SPEAKS. HE FIGHT BACK TEARS.
TOMMY: I'm takin' a walk.
BRENDAN: Been looking all over for you. How's it going?
TOMMY: It's going.
BRENDAN: I was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee.
TOMMY: I don't drink coffee. Whattya want?
BRENDAN: You don't want to go sit down I'm good right here.
TOMMY: I'm good right here.
BRENDAN: Shit, Tommy. How was I supposed to know I was never gonna see you guys You were briefed. You had the information. You chose the old man and the girl.
TOMMY: You were briefed. You had the information. You chose the old man and the girl.
BRENDAN: She wasn't some girl. I married her. She's my wife. Brendan reaches into his pocket and removes a recent Christmas PHOTO of Tess, Emily, and Rosie from his wallet.
TOMMY: Don't know `em.
BRENDAN: I know you don't know them. Of course you don't know them.
TOMMY: Why am I looking at pictures of people I don't know?
BRENDAN: Because that's my family.
TOMMY: And who are you exactly?
BRENDAN: I'm your brother, man.
TOMMY: You were in the Corps?
BRENDAN: I said I didn't know you were in the Corps.
TOMMY: I said I didn't know you were in the Corps.
BRENDAN: I wasn't in the Corps.
TOMMY: Then you ain't no brother to me. My brother was in the Corps. With that, Tommy walks briskly away from Brendan and up the beach. His brother runs after him.
BRENDAN: Jesus, Tommy. I was a 16 year old kid. What the hell did I know?
TOMMY: I don't know what you know. Why don't you go ask your girlfriend about it?
BRENDAN: She's my wife, Tommy. So that's it? I stay with Tess and I never get to see you guys again? Not a single phone call? Nothing? No response from Tommy. He's a wall.
TOMMY: Shit. He's just some old vet I train with. He means nothing to me. From what I hear he means nothing to you, either, so you got balls talking about forgiveness.
BRENDAN: That's got nothing to do with forgiveness. I've got a family to protect. Everything I do is for Tommy smirks. Walks away again.
TOMMY: ( TURNING AROUND )
BRENDAN: I'm not surprised you made the tournament, Brendan. You got some I fell in love, Tommy. What the hell was I supposed to do?
TOMMY: I'm not surprised you made the tournament, Brendan. You got some I fell in love, Tommy. What the hell was I supposed to do?
BRENDAN: I fell in love, Tommy. What the hell was I supposed to do?
TOMMY: You were supposed to stick to the plan. You were supposed to come with us. Mom needed you. I needed you. You were my big brother and you bailed on me. The words hit Brendan hard.
BRENDAN: You're not the only one who suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know she was sick. I never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me! That was not your decision to make!
TOMMY: You know what? You walk around with your pictures in your wallet and you're all, I forgive you, I forgive Pop. I forgive everyone. But you know what? You're full of Tommy and Brendan are right in each other's faces. Standing on the knife's edge of violence. They hold the stare down for a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war.
JOE ZITO: You realize you're supposed to seek my wise counsel when school's actually in session, right? All four of them laugh nervously. Working their way up to We want to use the auditorium this weekend to watch Mr. C in Sparta.
STEPHON: We want to use the auditorium this weekend to watch Mr. C in Sparta.
TITO: What do you say?
JOE ZITO: Let me get this straight. You want to use the auditorium to watch a suspended teacher engage in the activity he was suspended for? Am I hearing this correctly?
NASH: But everyone wants to see it.
KC: The gym's the only place that's big It's never gonna happen.
JOE ZITO: It's never gonna happen.
STEPHON: What if we get a petition?
TITO: Yeah. We'll get the whole school to sign it.
NASH: The power of democracy!
JOE ZITO: Look, I appreciate that you guys love your teacher. I really do. But there is nothing I can do for you. Zito turns and heads back to his desk. The kids, dejected, leave the office and walk off down the hallway.
CALLEN: Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen along with best-selling fight author Sam Sheridan. Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta he wanted to create, quite simply, the biggest Mixed Martial Arts spectacle in Five million dollars, Bryan. Five million dollars. J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is and put up the biggest purse this sport has ever seen.
SHERIDAN: Five million dollars, Bryan. Five million dollars. J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is and put up the biggest purse this sport has ever seen.
CALLEN: It's unprecedented, Sam. As is the hoopla surrounding Tommy Riordan, the war hero who has become an overnight sensation.
OFFICIAL: Five minutes, Paddy.
CALLEN: Sam. He ripped the door off a tank!
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. In the crowd, two sections of MARINES in full dress uniforms wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible for Tommy, who returns to his corner. Paddy attempts to give him some advice, but Tommy is not listening.
OFFICIAL: Show time. On the TV monitor, Tommy's annihilating knockout of Francisco Barbosa plays. Then, in the distance, the strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC can be heard. Brendan looks at Frank, who smiles and puts his hands on Brendan's shoulders.
FRANK: You can do this. He grabs the nervous Brendan's head between his hands.
BRENDAN: I can do this.
FRANK: Then let's go do this.
PADDY: Go get `em, son. Brendan barely acknowledges Paddy and keeps walking. Frank looks at Brendan with a "Who the hell is that?" expression. As they approach the dark lights of the arena, Beethoven continues to BOOM out over the loud speakers.
CALLEN: Classical music is about as fitting to this setting as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament. In fact, let me show you something. Callen holds up a plastic bag with water and a GOLDFISH This is Brendan Conlon. He's a feeder fish, and he's about to get dropped into a shark tank. Brendan gets greased up, then climbs into the cage.
SHERIDAN: C'mon, give the guy a break. At least we've seen him fight before. He was in the UFC. We remember him.
CALLEN: I remember him, too. I remember him being very unmemorable.
FRANK: You asked for it. Brendan grins and looks out at the rabid crowd.
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Alright, gentleman, you've been given your instructions, I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. The fighters head to their corners and wait for the bell.
FRANK: Have some fun, baby. At the sound of the bell, "Midnight" Le comes out hard and strong. He repeatedly KICKS Brendan in the leg and batters him with STRIKES. His power is overwhelming Brendan.
ZITO: Move! You gotta move!
ZITO: C'mon, Brendan, get outta there!
FRANK: Get out of there! Get out of there! Brendan tries to pry Midnight's hands off him. No use.
FRANK: Beautiful! Beautiful! He doesn't know what hit him! Brendan grins at Frank's positive spin on things, then looks across the cage at Midnight Le, who glares at Brendan.
SHERIDAN: It just did, Bryan.
ZITO: He tapped him out! He tapped him out! He did it! He did it! He did ON TV SCREEN: BRENDAN AND FRANK EMBRACING. CHAOS IN THE RING AND MIDNIGHT ON THE GROUND IN UTTER DISBELIEF. SHERIDAN ( V.O. ) This is what makes Mixed Martial Arts so great. There's so many ways to lose. One tiny miscalculation at any time and that's it.
CALLEN: Very technical finish, but come on, that's a fluke. A jubilant Brendan raises his arms in victory. The crowd responds to the gutsy underdog.
SHERIDAN: I hope you got a receipt for your INT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER Tess sits on the couch, TV still off. Her phone BEEPS. She grabs it quickly. A text reads: "I WON!!!!!!!!"
TESS: She starts dancing around the room, kissing her phone.
PADDY: You can do it, Brendan. Brendan glares at him and marches toward the cage.
FRANK: Take him down! Brendan grabs Kruller and FLIPS him to the canvas. Then he spins for an ARM BAR, a move similar to one seen earlier in the smoker fights.
PADDY: That's it, Brendan!
PADDY: Way to go, Brendan!
BRENDAN: I'd doing this!
PADDY: OK, son.
BRENDAN: I'm doing it!
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war! The bell RINGS and Tommy goes right after Santana and starts administering a beating. He bullies him into the cage and starts raining BLOWS all over him.
PADDY: Can't sleep, huh? Tommy feeds the machine and pulls. Says nothing. Paddy sits down in front of a slot machine next to Tommy.
TOMMY: How about deserting my unit? Is that really something, too? Yeah. I was on my way outta country when I came across those guys. What was I supposed to do, let `em drown?
PADDY: ( BEAT )
TOMMY: What'd I do? I took off. Paddy starts putting things together.
PADDY: That's why you go by Riordan. That's why the press can't find your service records. Tommy doesn't respond.
TOMMY: That is none of your business.
PADDY: Come on, kiddo. I've been there. I've done it. I've seen it. You can trust me. I'll understand.
TOMMY: Spare me the compassionate father routine, Pop. The suit don't fit.
PADDY: I'm really trying here, Tommy.
TOMMY: You're trying? Now? Where were you when it mattered? I needed this guy back when I was a kid. I don't need you now. It's too late now. Everything's already happened. You and Brendan don't seem to understand that. Let me explain something to you: the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you. Paddy's shaken. He can't fathom the anger in Tommy, yet he knows he's responsible. It's written all over him. Tears well up in his eyes. They seem to make Tommy madder.
PADDY: God pity `em! All shall perish except me! You bastards! Stop the ship, you bastards! He staggers around the room, giving a fragmented soliloquy to no audience.
MARINES: ( SINGING )
SHERIDAN: It sounds like VJ Day in Times Square, Bryan. I've never seen anything like it! Tommy climbs up the stairs and into the cage. He turns and nods at the Marines.
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Alright gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. In the center of the cage, Mad Dog is practically spitting in Tommy's face. Tommy's eyelids droop. He could not be less It's not gonna happen again. Callen and Sheridan look on as the two fighters retreat to their corners. The anticipation in the arena is incredible.
MAD DOG: It's not gonna happen again. Callen and Sheridan look on as the two fighters retreat to their corners. The anticipation in the arena is incredible.
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war!
COLT BOYD: Stop it! Stop the fight! It's such a savage beating, so malicious, that Rosenthal has to climb on Tommy's back to get him off of Mad Dog. If his mother is indeed in the crowd, she couldn't recognize him now. Beaten to an absolute pulp.
FRANK: You've got a visitor. Second row, 10 o'clock. Buzzing in the arena. The lights about to go down for the entrance of Koba. Before they do, Brendan looks up to see a familiar face at cageside. Tess. He can't believe his eyes.
FRANK: I want you to look right at him when he comes in here. Don't take your eyes off him. Brendan nods, then looks at Tess. Drawing strength. Frank leans over the railing and taps fists with his fighter.
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Alright, gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight.
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war! Koba comes straight at Brendan. His speed and strength are CALLEN ( V.O. ) Now the question is, how long can Brendan Conlon stay alive? Franks screams at Brendan to keep his distance. Tess watches through her fingers. And Koba keeps coming, snapping Brendan's head back with a jab and bludgeoning him with an uppercut to the chin. The Russian is doing whatever he wants to Brendan. He slices him up with strikes. Bruises his legs with kicks. Works him against the fence. Power slams him.
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Let's go to war! Koba comes right after Brendan, and it's soon more of the same. Power slams. Brutal strikes. Brendan's face is carved up and battered. He tries to go for a take down, but Koba snuffs it, then lifts Brendan off the mat again and carries him through the air. Frank screams, but there's nothing he can do. Brendan is brutally SLAMMED into the ground.
FRANK: Sit down. Breathe. ( grabbing Brendan's face ) Look at me! Look at me! Why are we here, Brendan? Why are we here? Are we here to win this fight? You tell me, `cause if we're not, I'll throw in the towel right now. We'll get Tess and we will go home. You don't knock him out, you lose the fight. Understand me? You don't knock him out, you don't have a home. Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank takes his cue to leave, but not before giving Brendan one last look. It's now or never. Brendan looks across the cage at Koba. Steels himself.
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Let's go to war! Brendan comes out and meets Koba in the center of the cage, but the Russian resumes his supremacy.
FRANK: Crank it! Crank it! The Russian tries to squirm away, but he can't. His face is contorted in PAIN. The cageside OFFICIAL indicates there's only 10 seconds left in the fight.
TESS: ( TO BRENDAN )
BRENDAN: I'm gonna fight him.
FRANK: One more time. Brendan climbs into the cage as the house LIGHTS DIM. The crowd is going bonkers. And they EXPLODE when Tommy appears at the end of the tunnel with his hoodie up and begins his march toward the cage. The Marines shower him with cheers and "Hoo-ahs." The girls scream. The rest of the audience stamps their feet and chants his name. But he acknowledges no one, and the hard look on his face never wavers.
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Gentlemen, this is the final. Five rounds. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do As Rosenthal finishes his instructions, Brendan peers into Tommy's empty corner.
BRENDAN: Where's Pop? Tommy turns without answering. All business. Brendan returns to his corner. Looks at Tess. So much emotion on her face.
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Gentlemen, are you ready? Are you ready? Let's go to war! Tommy comes right after his brother. Just like with his previous three opponents. A natural wrecking machine. Frank screams at Brendan to stay calm, but Tommy is all over him, POUNDING on him with savage intensity. As bad as the other fights were for Brendan, this one is worse.
TESS: What was that!
FRANK: C'mon, Josh! Brendan lays on the ground as Josh Rosenthal pulls Tommy off him and admonishes him for the cheap shot. Tommy stares at Brendan. You want more? Frank runs into the cage with the stool and Brendan limps over to him and sits down. Brendan stares at Tommy, who paces in his corner like a caged animal.
BRENDAN: Angle out, hit, and move.
FRANK: Good. Breathe. Relax. He's not your brother, right? He's just a guy who's in the way. Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. It's time. Frank glares at him as he picks up the stool.
FRANK: Switch! Switch! Tommy tries to pound Brendan out, but Brendan latches on to Tommy's arm, wraps his legs around him, and REVERSES position, just as he did with Midnight, the Dane, and Koba. Tommy is in deep trouble. Brendan pushes him face down on the canvas and cranks his shoulder. There's no escape.
BRENDAN: Tap, Tommy! Tommy SHRIEKS like an animal, but still won't quit. In fact, he elbows Brendan in the face in defiance. Brendan in turn cranks the shoulder even more. It's at the breaking point.
BRENDAN: I popped his shoulder.
FRANK: Relax, breathe.
BRENDAN: I heard it tear.
FRANK: You popped his shoulder? Good. I want you to pop his other shoulder. This is not what Brendan wants to hear. He looks over to Josh Frank snaps. Grabs Brendan by the face.
BRENDAN: Frank snaps. Grabs Brendan by the face.
FRANK: Hey! Hey! No Josh! Look at me! You got two rounds left! You need both rounds! Go in there, kick him in the head, take him down, and finish Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank exits the cage. The wounded Tommy stands in his corner, his ruined left arm hanging low. Brendan makes eye contact with him.
BRENDAN: Tommy! What are you doing?
TOMMY: Shut up! C'mon.
BRENDAN: What are you that crazy?
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Let's go to war! The BELL sounds. Round Four begins. Tommy throws useless right jabs. He's one handed and has no chance. Brendan stays away from him, not wanting to hurt his brother.
BRENDAN: What are you doing? It's over! Frank screams at Brendan from cageside to take the wounded Tommy out, but Brendan is reluctant.
FRANK: Finish him! You finish him! Tommy keeps throwing defiant right jabs at Brendan. Finally, with no choice, Brendan fires back. He batters the defenseless Tommy up against the cage and POUNDS away at him, blasting his left shoulder with punches that make Tommy wince in pain. It's anyone's guess how he can take it. Brendan presses his brother up against the cage. Begging him to quit. But Tommy merely responds by elbowing Brendan in the face again. This sets the older brother off, and he resumes pounding on Tommy until the HORN sounds and Rosenthal pulls Brendan away.
JOSH ROSENTHAL: Break! Break! Brendan heads back to his stool as Tommy leans against the cage in agony. The Marines scream for him, but his eyes are glazed over. It's unthinkable that he hasn't broken yet. From near cageside, Paddy looks to the corner and makes eye contact with Brendan. They exchange a small look of understanding. A NOD. They both know what needs to be done.
BRENDAN: I'm sorry, Tommy! I'm sorry! Tommy continues to struggle.
