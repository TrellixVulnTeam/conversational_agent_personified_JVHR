HIS COCKROACH: innocently approaching Eve from behind. She spins around. Blasts the insect. Wall-E is gut-punched.
EVE: Wall-E relaxes. CHUCKLES privately.

EVE: ( hums ) [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!]
EVE: Wall-E? Wall-E?
EVE: and four other probes slide out of the ship's side. Suspended in a horizontal rack. Wall-E is surprised to find her facing him. She remains shut down. Just a few feet away with a giant abyss between them.
PASSENGER #1: Well, I've been in my cabin all morning so let's hover over to the driving range and hit a few virtual balls into space.
PASSENGER #1: Well then what do you want to do?
PASSENGER #2: I don't know. Something.

ON MONORAIL: It pulls out of the station. Wall-E leaps on. Barely catches the last car. It glides down the concourse.
ON MONORAIL: Wall-E takes in the overstimulating scenery. Dozens of THEMED FOOD RESTAURANTS whizz by. Each specialty is served in the same JUMBO PLASTIC CUP.
MONORAIL PASSENGERS: Passengers next to Wall-E press their chair buttons. Their JUMPSUITS change from RED TO BLUE.
MARY: Date?! ( derisive snort ) Don't get me started! Every holo-date I've been on has been a virtual disaster! If I could just meet one who wasn't so superficial. There are no good men out there!.
