CLAIRE: Morning, beauty.
CLAIRE: Let's go. Or we'll never leave on time.
CAITLIN: ( muffled ) I'm totally ready.
CLAIRE: Come on, I'll make you some waffles, maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the

CAITLIN: You're such a morning person.

ANGLE: Through a stand of trees over a HIGH WOODEN FENCE, A YOUNG COUPLE is in the midst of a heated argument next door. Claire watches as the HUSBAND, a large imposing man with an unruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood of their huge old Buick. She tries to get a glimpse of the woman, but all that's visible is THE BACK OF HER BLOND HEAD. A TAN, SINEWY ARM encircles Claire's waist. She lets out a small gasp as a hand closes on her breast. It's Claire's husband, DR. NORMAN SPENCER, nibbling gently at her neck. He's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the prominent academic that he is. Claire, however, can't take her eyes off the scene below.
NORMAN: They at it again?
NORMAN: Christ, that's twice in.When did they move in?
CLAIRE: I think three.
NORMAN: Three weeks.
CLAIRE: What's their name?
NORMAN: Feur, I think. Psych department. Figures. They're all psychotic.
CLAIRE: She's awake.
NORMAN: We'll be quiet. Quick and quiet.
CLAIRE: I don't want to be either.
NORMAN: When's she out of here?
CLAIRE: Norman Spencer.
NORMAN: ( moving toward the stairs ) Alright. I can't take the rejection. I'm going to class.

NORMAN: I knew that. You think I didn't know
NORMAN: It's today?
CLAIRE: ( wistfully )
NORMAN: ( calling over his shoulder ) We're going to have to leave by three if we want to beat the traffic.
CLAIRE: ( absently ) Three o'clock.
ANGLE: Mrs. Feur drops her face into her hands.
CLAIRE: .and I still think we should get you some mittens.
CLAIRE: Do you have a scarf?
CAITLIN: Claire looks up from her little pad of paper.
CLAIRE: It's only two hours away.
CAITLIN: It's only two hours away.
CLAIRE: I know that.
CAITLIN: I'll come back all the time.
CLAIRE: Of course you will.
CAITLIN: I'm just saying, you're going to be
CLAIRE: Sweetheart, I've known this day was coming for a long time. I've got your father and the garden and the new house. You really don't have to worry.
CLAIRE: She nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace. Her eyes close.
CAITLIN: ( beat ) I have'ta go.
CAITLIN: I have'ta go.
CAITLIN: I'll call you.
CLAIRE: Come home anytime.
NORMAN: Really gonna leave me, huh?
NORMAN: Be good.
CAITLIN: .then turns and makes her way toward the large, old Columbia dorm. A banner is draped across its portals which Claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly shaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps. Her eyes are shining. Norman wraps an arm around her waist as she daps at a tear with a Kleenex.
CLAIRE: ( smiling ) I almost made it.
ANGLE: Caitlin glancing back at Claire with an apprehensive smile.
NORMAN: Whatcha reading?
CLAIRE: ( reading the cover, sexy voice ) Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic ( slight smile ) How is it?
NORMAN: ( slight smile ) How is it?
CLAIRE: Excellent. Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader Almost done.
NORMAN: ( lost in his book ) ( beat ) Almost done.
CLAIRE: If you have to work.
NORMAN: No, no. I'm just about.
NORMAN: How are you?
CLAIRE: It's okay if you're not.
NORMAN: It's okay if you're not.
CLAIRE: I am, really.
NORMAN: It's just she's been the focus for a Not the focus.
CLAIRE: Not the focus.
NORMAN: You know what I mean.
CLAIRE: To tell you the truth.I'm You are.
NORMAN: You are.
CLAIRE: To get my life back. To have some time for myself. Some time for us.
NORMAN: You did a great job. She's a good kid.
CLAIRE: We did.
NORMAN: It's just us now.
CLAIRE: I know.
NORMAN: Wanna fool around?
CLAIRE: Wanna fool around?
NORMAN: Wanna fool around?
CLAIRE: They start to kiss. It's slow and a bit methodical in the manner of long time lovers. Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN WAILING can be heard. They stop.
NORMAN: Did you.
CLAIRE: They listen. The sounds start to become louder. It is clearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and savage love making.
NORMAN: He walks over and closes the window. It doesn't help.
NORMAN: I guess they're making up.
CLAIRE: What is he doing to her?
NORMAN: And we moved out here for the quiet.
CLAIRE: Beat. The mood has passed.
NORMAN: Maybe we should just.
CLAIRE: I'm finished at three. No. Squash with After that.
NORMAN: I'm finished at three. No. Squash with After that.
CLAIRE: After that.
NORMAN: I'll be there. Love you.
NORMAN: Love you.
CLAIRE: They lie together in the darkness as the Feurs finally INT. CAITLIN'S ROOM - DAY Claire pushes open the door to Caitlin's room carrying an armful of FOLDED LAUNDRY. She moves quickly to the bureau, not wanting to spend much time in here, then grabs a TINY BLACK TOP from the pile, and drops it into a drawer. She's just about to close it, when something catches her eye.
CLAIRE'S POV: She drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old JUILLIARD T-SHIRT with a very seventies logo from the drawer. Claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of Caitlin's recently concluded childhood; PICTURES, TROPHIES,
CLAIRE: There's no reaction.

CLAIRE: He gives her a "Didn't I just say so" look. She smiles.
CLAIRE: I'll make you some coffee.
CLAIRE'S POV: In the split second of brilliance, she sees Mr. Feur, in shirtsleeves, drenched, dragging A LARGE DUFFEL toward the open trunk of his car.

NORMAN: Sorry. You understand.
CLAIRE: Did you call about the Feurs?
NORMAN: Oh, right. Yes. Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart. Wouldn't hurt a fly.

DR. DRAYTON: You're joking.
CLAIRE: You're joking.
DR. DRAYTON: It's hard because I'm a complete stranger and what we're talking about is incredibly personal. Besides, the first time most people come here, a part of them is wondering if I'm gonna think they're crazy.
DR. DRAYTON: Don't worry, I'm required to have at least three sessions in order to commit.
DR. DRAYTON: Now that's a joke.
DR. DRAYTON: I have some training at helping people through the stressful moments in life, one of which you may or may not be experiencing. If you want to get some stuff off your chest, great. If not. These are good.

JODY: Claire, this is.this is.
CLAIRE: INT. FOYER - NIGHT Claire arrives at the open front door in time to see the Karman-Ghia tearing out of the driveway. She turns and goes back into the house.
CRASH!: She edges into.
CLAIRE'S POV: The piece of glass, wedged next to what looks like A COPPER COIN in the crack. It's too big to be a penny. She tries to use the piece of glass to pry it free, but recoils. A tiny drop of blood appears on her finger, which she pops into her mouth.
CLAIRE: What do you want?!
"YOU KNOW": She draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom.
NORMAN: What are you doing out here?
CLAIRE: He killed her. I'm not crazy. He killed her and
NORMAN: This is the Feur thing?

NORMAN: Who did?
CLAIRE: Jody and I. And she was there, Norman, she was. It scared Jody so bad she had to How did you
NORMAN: How did you
CLAIRE: Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
NORMAN: Are you angry at me?
CLAIRE: Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
NORMAN: Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
CLAIRE: What are you.? No.
NORMAN: You know what I've got at stake with this paper. You know that. I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
CLAIRE: Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or.
NORMAN: Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or.
CLAIRE: The accident.?
NORMAN: But then you've been so much better.
CLAIRE: Norman, this isn't about you. This is something that's happening to me. It's not to get even.and it's not some warped bid for attention. Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not.
NORMAN: No! Not sweetheart, no. I believe in what's happening. I don't want to, but I do. I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
CLAIRE: No! Not sweetheart, no. I believe in what's happening. I don't want to, but I do. I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
NORMAN: You're overreacting.
CLAIRE: Don't tell me how to react!
NORMAN: Keep your voice down.
CLAIRE: I will NOT.
CLAIRE: ( still loud ) Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm losing my ( looking around ) Claire, please. .But what if I'm not? What if she died in terror and betrayal and some part of her can't move on while that's unresolved. Can't you just.

CLAIRE: .But what if I'm not? What if she died in terror and betrayal and some part of her can't move on while that's unresolved. Can't you just.
CLAIRE: Claire walks past him toward the parking lot.
NORMAN: Claire, please.
CLAIRE: ( walking up )
CLAIRE: You think you're smart, don't you? You think you got away clean. Well, I know you killed her. You drowned her in the bathtub and got rid of her somewhere and I'm gonna find her, you murdering
MR. FEUR: ( scoffing ) Give me that shit. Your wife.
CLAIRE: ( scoffing ) Give me that shit. Your wife.
MR. FEUR: I didn't kill my wife.
NORMAN: ( to Mr. Feur ) I'm sorry.
CLAIRE: ( over Norman ) Then where is she?
MR. FEUR: Claire and Norman turn. A BLOND WOMAN backs out of the passenger seat. She turns. IT'S NOT THE FACE CLAIRE HAS SEEN. Claire looks sucker punched.
CLAIRE: And his face.it seemed so gentle, and I knew.in that second I knew that I'd imagined the whole thing.
CLAIRE: What's happening to me?
DR. DRAYTON: Well, that's what we're here for.
DR. DRAYTON: Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you.that gave you reason for Yes, but.
CLAIRE: Yes, but.
DR. DRAYTON: Your friend saw them.
CLAIRE: Isn't there something called group You think you influenced her?
DR. DRAYTON: You think you influenced her?
CLAIRE: Maybe. I don't know. I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt.alive. Like somebody needed me. And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
DR. DRAYTON: You're saying you willed these events to I don't know, I'm very confused right Did you ever find out what it wanted?
CLAIRE: I don't know, I'm very confused right Did you ever find out what it wanted?
DR. DRAYTON: Did you ever find out what it wanted?
CLAIRE: She said, "You know." That I know.
DR. DRAYTON: Do you?
CLAIRE: DR. DRAYTON ( beat )
DR. DRAYTON: What do you think?
CLAIRE: I felt.pain. That she'd been hurt by This is great. I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my
DR. DRAYTON: Have you been hurt?
CLAIRE: Me? No. Well, in the accident I was injured, but.
DR. DRAYTON: You were in an accident?
CLAIRE: Last year. I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this. .a minor concussion. But the car looked bad. It could have been bad. I think it scared the hell out of Norman. How's your marriage?
DR. DRAYTON: How's your marriage?
CLAIRE: Listen, don't hold back.
CLAIRE: Well, he's been amazing throughout this whole thing. Patient and caring. I mean, sure, he can be obsessed with his work, and.it's a very important time right now with all that. But, sometimes.I mean with everybody, right? Sometimes it's like.
DR. DRAYTON: That he doesn't.see me, or, you know, that I'm.that's something's wrong.with That can't feel good.
CLAIRE: That he doesn't.see me, or, you know, that I'm.that's something's wrong.with That can't feel good.
DR. DRAYTON: That can't feel good.
CLAIRE: No, it doesn't.Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it. My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there. Let's deal with that. I'm willing to deal with that. I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
DR. DRAYTON: Fair enough. But you should know that I'm far less concerned with whether things you saw "existed," than I am with why you saw them.
MRS. FEUR: I wanted to apologize.
CLAIRE: You do?
MRS. FEUR: For scaring you like I did. When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day.
CLAIRE: And then you weren't there.
MRS. FEUR: Right. I'm sorry.
CLAIRE: Would you like some iced tea?
MRS. FEUR: Very much.
MRS. FEUR: Your house is so beautiful.
CLAIRE: Thank you.
MRS. FEUR: And these roses. They're much prettier up close. I.there's something I have to ask
CLAIRE: I.there's something I have to ask
CLAIRE: That day.at the fence. You seemed terrified. I don't think I was imagining
MRS. FEUR: Of what? What were you so afraid of?
CLAIRE: Of what? What were you so afraid of?
MRS. FEUR: You're going to think I'm crazy or
CLAIRE: Not this week.
MRS. FEUR: MRS. FEUR
CLAIRE: MRS. FEUR
MRS. FEUR: Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe? That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
CLAIRE: MRS. FEUR ( beat )
MRS. FEUR: I couldn't catch my breath. That's not a metaphor, that's.And I panicked. I never dreamed anyone would hear me back I tried to leave him. Went to my mother's in Boston. He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
MRS. FEUR: You must think I'm pathetic.
CLAIRE: No. No, I don't.
MRS. FEUR: I'm sorry that I frightened you like that. But I was so touched by your concern. I've been lonely here. Perhaps we could be friends.
CLAIRE: I would like that.
NORMAN: ( on a cell phone ) .I'm pulling up, Yuri. I'll see you for ( to Claire ) Sure you won't stay?

YOUNG MAN: Bitch. Caitlin's band.
CLAIRE: ( stunned ) Caitlin's band?
YOUNG MAN: Yeah. They're really good. I would have gone, but I have a paper. And I'm not just saying that because you're a mother.
CLAIRE: Thank you.
CLAIRE'S POV: A shaggy trio of musicians on the stage, pumping through a jangly, but surprisingly melodic song. Her eyes race across the faces of a BUTCH FEMALE DRUMMER, an emaciated GUITARIST/SINGER and stop on the BASS PLAYER.Caitlin. She rocks back and forth to her own hypnotic bass line, EYES
CLAIRE: That was very good.
CAITLIN: Mom, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
CLAIRE: Caitlin stares at the ground.
CAITLIN: I didn't want to bring up memories. I didn't want to do anything that might make you regret your choices.
CAITLIN: Besides, Dad would have freaked.
CLAIRE: No, he wouldn't.
CAITLIN: I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
CLAIRE: That's not true.
CAITLIN: Yes it is. Can we please not do that? Please? Cause it is.
CLAIRE: He loves you very much. He just
CAITLIN: I know he does.
CAITLIN: Are you mad at me?
CLAIRE: Listen to me. The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret.is the choice. I made to be your mother.
CLAIRE: I miss you.
CAITLIN: So much.
CLAIRE: ( laughing ) It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
CAITLIN: What do you mean?
CLAIRE: I started seeing things.
CAITLIN: A ghost?
CLAIRE: Did you?
CAITLIN: No. But once I heard.
CLAIRE: Someone crying. A girl. I thought I was crazy.
CAITLIN: Someone crying. A girl. I thought I was crazy.
CLAIRE: ( quietly ) Then we both are.
TEMPLETON: There they are.
NORMAN: You remember my wife, Claire.
MRS. TEMPLETON: ( shaking hands ) Of course. You must be so proud.
CLAIRE: I am.
MRS. TEMPLETON: ( to Norman ) Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
TEMPLETON: Must've been some paper. Your father would be very proud.
NORMAN: Claire notices this and squeezes his hand. Templeton leads Norman into a large living room which is filled with colleagues. Several of them turn and begin clapping. Others follow suit.
CLAIRE: ( to bartender ) White wine please.
CLAIRE: They hug.
JODY: Are you okay?
CLAIRE: I think so
JODY: I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, It's alright.
CLAIRE: It's alright.
JODY: I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
JODY: Does Norman know?
CLAIRE: Jody, she's alive.
JODY: Mrs. Feur. She's alive. I met her. She's really sweet.
CLAIRE: Mrs. Feur. She's alive. I met her. She's really sweet.
JODY: Then what was it?

JODY: But Claire
CLAIRE: Jody recognizes her fragility.
JODY: Okay. Okay.
CLAIRE: I've got to find a bathroom. I'll call

MRS. TEMPLETON: Wonderful. It's good to see you two doing so well.
CLAIRE: I'm sorry?
MRS. TEMPLETON: I know how hard it can be sometimes.
CLAIRE: Uh-huh. What can be?
MRS. TEMPLETON: Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last
MRS. TEMPLETON: For the Dupont Chair. I swear. I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.

NORMAN: A cheap wine glass from the caterers. You started crying. I tried to comfort you.
CLAIRE: ( something's triggered ) In the living room.
NORMAN: You shoved me away and ran out to the patio. I took you home.
CLAIRE: But why? I can't understand how I could just completely
NORMAN: It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving. It was a hard time.
CLAIRE: But I don't remember.
NORMAN: Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
CLAIRE: What's wrong with me?
NORMAN: ( reassuring ) Nothing. Nothing at all. It's been a hard year. But you're better now. And things are really looking up for us. So let's try to enjoy that. ( gently )
CLAIRE: Yes. Yes. That's what I want.
CLAIRE: Claire double clicks on it, then waits breathlessly as a blurry cyber photo fills the screen. Slowly, higher resolution moves down the image.
LATER: Claire is staring down at the girl's face on the print out.
VOICE: ( on phone ) .she was practically a townie. Grew up in Bradford.
CLAIRE: And she was never found?
VOICE: ( on phone ) Nah. She was a live wire. Had this old Mustang Fastback. It's gone too. Most of her friends think she's tooling around Mexico somewhere. Police downgraded her to a runaway.

NORMAN: ( calmly ) Claire, I've tried to be there. I know you're going through something that I can't understand.but it's enough.
NORMAN: Do you want to go see someone? Together? Should we call Dr. Drayton?
NORMAN: Well then what? Claire, what? Tell me what I can do. It's her.
CLAIRE: It's her.
CLAIRE: I don't want to make you angry. But she's here. And I don't know why.

MRS. FRANK: I'm watchin' my shows.
MRS. FRANK: Just plain old coffee. None of that mocha It's fine.
CLAIRE: It's fine.
MRS. FRANK: You look a little old for a student.
CLAIRE: I'm not. We.we met at a party.
MRS. FRANK: Sounds about right. Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's. Sure didn't get it from me. They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young. Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
CLAIRE: She never mentioned her father.
MRS. FRANK: Well she wouldn't. He left when she was twelve. Never spoke about him after that.
MRS. FRANK: Don't need the sound. You can pretty much tell what's happening by the faces. Turn it up sometimes, though. Feels like someone's here.
MRS. FRANK: Why are you here?
CLAIRE: I don't know.
MRS. FRANK: It's like that. Doesn't seem real. No note. Nothing. Cops say she'll be back. I just wanna know what happened.
MRS. FRANK: Wanna see her room?

CLAIRE: I should be going anyway.
MRS. FRANK: Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
CLAIRE: Of course.
CLAIRE: What was her major?
MRS. FRANK: Biology. She wanted to be a doctor.
CLAIRE: I need to know the truth.
CLAIRE: Madison, please.help me.
CLAIRE: What am I doing?
REVERSE: Norman closes the refrigerator door and sees Claire standing before him, stripped down to a skirt and slip top. There's a different physicality to her movements.a different rhythm to her speech.
CLAIRE: Hello, Dr. Spencer.
NORMAN: Mrs. Spencer.
CLAIRE: Forbidden fruit.
CLAIRE: Got a problem with that.
NORMAN: I take it your not mad at me.

NORMAN: ( rattled )
CLAIRE: I was there.
NORMAN: ( flooding back to her ) I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her.in my house.
CLAIRE: ( flooding back to her ) I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her.in my house.

NORMAN: It was last year. We were having So you fucked a student?!
CLAIRE: So you fucked a student?!
NORMAN: ( reaching for her ) That's not what I'm sayi
CLAIRE: ( pulling back ) DON'T touch me. Just get away from me.
CLAIRE: I SAID GET OUT!
CLAIRE: She bolts toward the living room. He follows her.
NORMAN: ( welling up ) Claire, please don't.
CLAIRE: What did you think I would do? Jesus Christ! I gave up my life and my music.
NORMAN: I never asked you to quit!
CLAIRE: .Oh BULLSHIT. You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family.
NORMAN: THAT'S NOT TRUE! You wanted to quit! And then when you did, you hated me for it. so you gave it all to her.

CLAIRE: You made it impossible for me to be someone you could be in love with.
CLAIRE: I want you to answer one question.
CLAIRE: Did you have anything to do with her
NORMAN: Claire goes pale.
NORMAN: She was damaged and unstable. The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became. Finally, she showed up at the new house.
CLAIRE: How did she know where it was?
CLAIRE: ( softly ) Our dream house.
NORMAN: She was out of control. She said she was going to kill herself.or you. I never thought she'd go through with any of it, but then she was gone.
CLAIRE: She did it.
NORMAN: We don't know that for sure.
CLAIRE: Of course she did, Norman. What else could it be? Oh God, what have I done? How could I have let this into our lives?
NORMAN: Oh God, what have I done? How could I have let this into our lives?
CLAIRE: I don't know.

JODY: I started to walk over.but he wasn't alone. A blond. I only caught a glimpse. She was young. I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
CLAIRE: Partly because I didn't want to hurt you.but partly.partly because I was I had just been left by Richard. I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.

JODY: By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
CLAIRE: Too late? Jody, it was an accident.
JODY: Alone? On a two lane road? With a ton of Valium in your system?
JODY: I got there first. Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman. He seemed desperate not to lose you. He promised to handle it. And we all let it drop away.
CLAIRE: All of us. I'm a terrible friend.
JODY: I'm a terrible friend.
CLAIRE: Claire turns.
CLAIRE: How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell What are you going to do?
JODY: What are you going to do?
CLAIRE: I don't know.
JODY: If she was dangerous before
CLAIRE: She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
JODY: You don't know that. If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out. Somehow you have to break the connection.

NORMAN: Last sail of the year.

CLAIRE: Jody he was lying.
JODY: What if he was? Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
CLAIRE: I guess not.
JODY: He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
JODY: You've got a beautiful life. And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you. I've come to think that's all that really I don't know.
CLAIRE: I don't know.
JODY: Trust me, Claire. You hear something. change the subject. You find something. get rid of it, throw it in the lake. You know what happened. The rest is only details. And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those. If you want to put this back together.just let it go. What's that for?
NORMAN: What's that for?
CLAIRE: I'm cooking you dinner.
NORMAN: I'm cooking you dinner.
CLAIRE: You don't have to do that.
NORMAN: I know.
CLAIRE: Fine. I'll do the shopping.
HIPPIE WOMAN: What are you looking for?
CLAIRE: I don't really know.
HIPPIE WOMAN: Know what you mean.
CLAIRE: Looking for this?
CLAIRE: She's out there isn't she? She's in the Okay. Don't.you don't understand what this is.
NORMAN: Okay. Don't.you don't understand what this is.
CLAIRE: Don't I, Norman? YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE. Of a woman you killed!
NORMAN: ( nearly hysterical ) I did NOT! I did not kill anyone. Jesus. Claire, listen to me. I walked in and she was lying there dead. I swear to you. On my life! She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me! To destroy us! If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have
CLAIRE: I don't believe you.
NORMAN: IT'S TRUE. That's.you have to believe me! Oh God, I'm telling you the truth! I did what I had to, Claire. She was gone. There was nothing I could do for her. I did.I put her in the lake. I rolled the car in.and I watched it sink. And I've lived with that image ever since. I couldn't just stand there while everything my career, us, everything, just washed away. Don't you see, Claire? She's doing this! This is exactly what she wants you to think!
CLAIRE: I don't know what's true anymore. But that girl must be brought up. Now do you want to call the police? Or should I?
NORMAN: Fine. I can't live with it anymore.
NORMAN: This is Dr. Norman Spencer. No, it's not an emergency.
NORMAN: I have some information about a missing girl, Madison Frank.Yes. Could you send an officer? Fifteen Willoughby, about a mile before the bridge.Thank you.
NORMAN: You did the right thing. I'm going to get cleaned up.
CLAIRE'S POV: The necklace still in her hand. She looks up again into the mirror. Her face goes strangely blank and, almost mechanically, she clasps the necklace onto her neck. Suddenly, she stares over at the CORDLESS PHONE lying on the bed for a long moment. She walks over, picks up the phone and looks at it.
CLAIRE'S POV: The redial button. She stares at the bathroom door, then hits the button. Two rings, then:
VOICE: ( on phone ) Directory assistance.
NORMAN: God, how did we come to this?
NORMAN: The ghost stuff, that was impressive.
CLAIRE'S POV: Ceiling, shapes.
NORMAN: I figure you saw her that day in the house and just gradually intuited the whole damn thing. That would be pretty astonishing. A passive-aggressive
NORMAN: Wasn't until the shower that I realized you actually believed it. Nearly froze to death waiting for you. Thought the circuit breaker would kick back over and I'd be toast.
NORMAN: The crazy thing is.I have never for one moment stopped loving you.
NORMAN: Don't worry about Caitlin. I'm sure in some tragic way this'll bring us closer
NORMAN: If anything ever happened to her, I'd. Anyway, thanks.
NORMAN: ( tearfully ) I'm so sorry.
CLAIRE: ( sloppy, guttural ) ( slurry )
NORMAN: ( slurry )
CLAIRE: ( slurry )
NORMAN: Norman seems unnerved that she's still clinging to her belief in the ghost.
CLAIRE: Norman seems unnerved that she's still clinging to her belief in the ghost.
MADISON!: Norman seems unnerved that she's still clinging to her belief in the ghost.
NORMAN: That's a little much, don't you think?
NORMAN: Oops. Can't have that.
NORMAN'S POV: His arms around MADISON'S BEAUTIFUL CORPSE. Norman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the BRASS SHOWER NOZZLE. He staggers out of the bathroom before collapsing with a thud. The water finally rises above Claire's nostrils. Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free. The water slowly descends. When it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finally clears the descending water. She chokes in great gulps of The drug is finally wearing off. Claire sits up. Norman's unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway. She turns off the water and stands unsteadily. She looks around for the phone and finally spots the little antenna protruding from under Norman. She delicately pulls the phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that it's been broken by his fall. She drops it and walks quietly out of the room.
CLAIRE: Come on.come on.
ANGLE: Claire through the windshield. Her face striped by the reflection of the bridge lights which whip one-by-one across the windshield. She flips open the cell phone and punches in 911. It blinks: "NO SERVICE."
CLAIRE: She glances into the rear view mirror.
CLAIRE'S POV: A stern section of the boat's COVERING TARP untied, flapping in the breeze. Claire desperately punches the "talk" button again."NO SERVICE." She's past the center of the bridge. She looks again: "ROAM." Claire punches the talk button again.
SMASH!: A TRAILER CRANK punches through the window. Norman's arm follows, coiling like a python around Claire's neck, his grim visage pressed against the glass. She squashes down the accelerator.
CLAIRE: She yanks the emergency brake, but it's too late.the submerged wheels lock and slide slowly down the mossy ramp. The truck is nearly submerged.
CLAIRE: ( desperately ) Norman, please.
CLAIRE: Think of Caitlin.
SMASH!: When the front of the pickup lands on the hood of the car, the Mustang's windshield shatters. A PALE SHAPE FLOATS
