JORDAN: Twenty five grand to the first cocksucker to nail a bullseye!
CAPTAIN DAVE: Pull up! Jesus! We're gonna
JORDAN: ( to Captain Dave ) Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay,
JORDAN: I take Quaaludes for my back, fifteen to twenty a day.
JORDAN: But of all the drugs under God's blue heaven, there's one that's my absolute favorite.
JORDAN: Enough of this shit'll make you invincible, able to conquer the world and eviscerate your enemies.
JERRY FOGEL: You got a problem with that? Nope. No problem at all.
JORDAN: Nope. No problem at all.
JERRY FOGEL: Your job is `connector', which means you'll be dialing the phone over 500 times a day, trying to `connect' me with business owners. And till you pass your Series 7, that's all you'll be doing. Sit.
MARK HANNA: Jordan? Mark Hanna. Good, you've met Jerry. One of the smartest guys in the office. Who's ever sucked a dog's cock out of loneliness.
JERRY FOGEL: Smile and dial. And don't pick your fucking head up till one.
MARK HANNA: Don't mind Jerry, his father raped him as a child. Besides, I'm senior broker here, he's a worthless piker. I heard you pitched stock at your job Had to do something to stand out.
JORDAN: Had to do something to stand out.
MARK HANNA: I fuckin' love that! Let's grab lunch later. Windows good with Great. Yeah.
JORDAN: Great. Yeah.
MARK HANNA: Let's fuck!!
BROKER #1: ( to Broker #2 ) Miniscribe's a fuckin' steal! Thirty eight bucks a share!
MARK HANNA: ( into headset ) Your broker in West Virginia? What are you buying, a coal mine? It's the 80s, the game is high- ( to Broker #3 ) Fuckface! I got 50,000 July 50s!
BROKER #2: ( to Broker #3 ) Fuckface! I got 50,000 July 50s!
JERRY FOGEL: Dial the cocksucking phone!
MARK HANNA: ( offering the spoon ) Got enough for one more? Tootski?
JORDAN: No. Thanks though.
HECTOR: Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon? Here's the game plan, Hector. Bring us two Absolut Martinis straight up. Precisely seven and a half minutes after you deliver those you'll bring two more, then two more every five minutes until one of us passes out.
MARK HANNA: Here's the game plan, Hector. Bring us two Absolut Martinis straight up. Precisely seven and a half minutes after you deliver those you'll bring two more, then two more every five minutes until one of us passes out.
HECTOR: An excellent strategy, sir.
JORDAN: Actually, I'm good with 7-Up.
MARK HANNA: First day on Wall Street, Hector. Give him time. No thanks, I'm not eating.
JORDAN: You can get high during the day and still function?
MARK HANNA: High is the only way to do this fucking job. Guy who coined the term "three-martini lunch" was a woman. Cocaine and hookers, my friend, the keys to success.
JORDAN: I gotta say, I'm really excited about being part of your team. I wanna do all I can for our clients and
MARK HANNA: ( reciting an ad ) "Here at L.F. Rothschild, our clients aren't just important, they're family." Just as long as we get our taste first. Remember something, Jordan, your top priority in this job: make us money. If the clients get rich along the way, bully for them. Got a girlfriend?
JORDAN: Wife. She cuts hair.
MARK HANNA: OK, first rule of Wall Street. Nobody and I don't care if you're Warren Buffet or Jimmy Buffet nobody knows if a stock's going up, down or fucking sideways, least of all stock brokers. But we have to pretend we know. Make sure you stay relaxed. Nobody wants to buy something from someone who sounds like they haven't gotten laid in a month. Take breaks when you feel stressed, jerk off if you can. You like jerking off, right?
JORDAN: Well. sure.
MARK HANNA: Good, jerking off is key. And I highly recommend cocaine, which will make you dial faster, which is good for me. Churn `em and burn `em, baby.
MARK HANNA: Holy. Fucking. Shit.
TERESA: So I'll take an extra shift, don't worry about it.
JORDAN: You work too much as it is.
TERESA: We could pawn my engagement ring.
JORDAN: We're not pawning anything. I'm gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.
TERESA: You know that doesn't matter,
JORDAN: ( points to an ad ) "Nobody Beats the Wiz". I could be a stock boy.
TERESA: You're a stock broker.
JORDAN: No one's hiring brokers right now,
TERESA: This place is.
JORDAN: I'm looking for Investor's Center?
DWAYNE: That's us, hey. Dwayne.
JORDAN: ( as they shake hands ) Jordan Belfort, I called earlier. I was a broker with Rothschild.
TOBY WELCH: I'm tellin' you, this stock is goin' up!. Cause I know, okay?!. I have inside
JORDAN: Where are your quotrons?
DWAYNE: No quotrons, we sell off the pink sheets penny stocks.
JORDAN: Six cents a share? Who buys this Schmucks mostly. Mailmen, plumbers, people thinking they can get rich quick. They answer our ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.
DWAYNE: Schmucks mostly. Mailmen, plumbers, people thinking they can get rich quick. They answer our ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.
JORDAN: The spread on these is huge.
DWAYNE: So's your commission, that's the point. Blue chips stocks you get what, one percent? Pink sheets are fifty.
JORDAN: Wait a second. You're telling me if I sell two thousand dollars worth of stock, my commission is a thousand bucks?
DWAYNE: Technically, yeah, but not even the biggest schmuck buys two thousand dollars of this shit.
JORDAN: ( into phone ) Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan Belfort with Investor's Center in New York City. You recently responded to one of our ads.
TOBY WELCH: How'd you fuckin' do that?
JORDAN: It's a rock-solid company, sir, it's the next Microsoft. Six thousand. Terrific.
DONNIE: That your Jag in the lot?
JORDAN: Nice ride. Donnie Azoff.
DONNIE: Nice ride. Donnie Azoff.
JORDAN: Jordan Belfort.
DONNIE: I've seen it around. We live in the same building. Twelfth floor? What do you do, bro?
JORDAN: Stock broker.
DONNIE: Kids furniture, me and my brother- in-law. Making any money?
JORDAN: Seventy grand last month.
DONNIE: Get the fuck out. You made seventy grand in one month.
JORDAN: Seventy two actually.
DONNIE: Tell you what. You show me a pay stub with $72,000 on it, I'm quitting my job right now and coming to work with you.
DONNIE: Yo Paulie, it's Donnie. Yeah, listen, I quit.
DONNIE: No problem, if we have a kid who's a retard, we'll just leave it on the steps of some institution.
DONNIE: You now, take a hit!
JORDAN: Omigod, I fuckin' love you!!
JORDAN: see everyone wants to get rich, so you're already half way there by the time the call starts.
SEA OTTER: I sold weed once to this Amish dude, had one of those beards with no mustache?
ROBBIE FEINBERG: SEA OTTER
SEA OTTER: He only wanted to make furniture.
CHESTER MING: What's that got to do with He just said everyone wants to get rich.
SEA OTTER: He just said everyone wants to get rich.
ROBBIE FEINBERG: ( to Jordan ) That's true, you did.
SEA OTTER: Buddhists too, they don't give a shit about money either.
CHESTER MING: Man I could sell weed to anybody, get a convent full of nuns fucking
TERESA: Omigod. Jordan.
JORDAN: You like it?
TERESA: It's beautiful.
JORDAN: They're small, I know, but the stones are really high quality.
TERESA: No, no. I love it.
JORDAN: Then what?
TERESA: I don't know, it's just these stocks, these crappy companies.
JORDAN: In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.
TERESA: Why can't you be legitimate now?
JORDAN: It's not illegal, Teresa, technically. I mean they're real stocks, they're just.
TERESA: Never gonna make anybody money. Wouldn't you feel better selling this junk to rich people, who can afford to lose the money at least?
JORDAN: Rich people don't buy penny Why not?
TERESA: Why not?
JORDAN: Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton Oakmont. The clients we've gone after in the past they're done. We will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent of Americans. The methods we've used over. Loud, obnoxious sales hype is worthless with these
JORDAN: and once Kodak settles the lawsuit, institutions will be permitted to buy their shares in large blocks again. And when that happens, which is any day now, what do you think will happen to the price of Kodak stock?
JORDAN: Exactly. Which is why you should pick up 5000 shares today, a $200,000 investment.
JORDAN: Then you lower your voice.
JORDAN: Believe me, sir, you will not be
JORDAN: Then you wait. Whoever speaks first loses. At this point, where are we in the sale? Chester?
CHESTER MING: About to close?
JORDAN: No, you sweet and sour douchebag! We're at the beginning of the beginning! This is where the sale starts. You as a salesman are almost hoping he says no so you can finally do your fucking job!
JORDAN: He doesn't know, he needs to think, he's gotta ask his wife! The fact is it doesn't matter what the fuck he says! If he's already agreed that the stock's going up, then the only real objection he has at this point is he doesn't trust you! And he shouldn't trust you, you're a fucking salesman! So what do you say?
DONNIE: Let me ask you this, sir had I been your broker for the past three to four years and made you money on a consistent basis, you probably wouldn't say you need to think about it, you'd probably say pick me up three or four thousand shares, am I right?
SEA OTTER: Wait a second. You mean to tell me if I put you in Union Carbide at 7 and took you out at 32
ROBBIE FEINBERG: If I put you in Texas Instruments at 11 and took you out at 47
CHESTER MING: Walmart at 16 and took you out at 95, you wouldn't say Chester pick me up 10,000 shares? C'mon.
DONNIE: So the problem is that I don't have the luxury of a track record. Sir, let me reintroduce myself to you. My name is Donnie Azoff
RUGRAT: Nicky Koskoff
CHESTER MING: Chester Ming
PETER DEBLASIO: Peter DeBlasio from Stratton Oakmont in New York City
TOBY WELCH: and I plan on being the top broker in my firm this year.
SEA OTTER: So what about this? We start small with 500 shares, a cash outlay of $20,000.
KALIL: If the stock goes up 10%, will that make you a rich man? Of course not.
KIMMIE BELZER: If if goes down 10%, will it make you a poor man? No..
CHESTER MING: What this trade will do is serve as a benchmark for future The downside is minimal and the upside is a long-term relationship with a broker on Wall Street who will consistently make you money.
PETER DEBLASIO: The downside is minimal and the upside is a long-term relationship with a broker on Wall Street who will consistently make you money.
JORDAN: Your only regret will be that I didn't call you six months ago.
JORDAN: Everybody have a good week?
JORDAN: That conniving little twat! "The Wolf of Wall Street".
TERESA: ( on the bright side ) Your hair looks good.
JORDAN: "Jordan Belfort, a twisted version of Robin Hood who takes from the rich and gives to himself and his merry band of brokers".
TERESA: There's no such thing as bad publicity, sweetie.
JORDAN: The hell's all this?
JANET: The Forbes article. They're applying for jobs.
JOB APPLICANTS: Mr. Belfort! Over here! Sir!

ROBBIE: He'll be wearing a helmet. Plus they've got, like, superhuman strength anyway.
DONNIE: I did hear you're not supposed to make direct eye contact. If you look at them too long in their eyes they get freaked out - their wires cross.
JORDAN: I think there's a limit to how far we can go. I mean we can throw shit at him and -
DONNIE: They have a lot of feelings.
JORDAN: There's a specific thing that they'll do - You can throw him at a dart board but if you want him to show his cock or -
ROBBIE: Yes, that's what this guy does.
RUGRAT: That's his gift.
ROBBIE: Can we also bowl with him?
RUGRAT: His brother is actually the They strap a skateboard to him and throw him down an alley.
ROBBIE: They strap a skateboard to him and throw him down an alley.
RUGRAT: They're ornery, too, the little pricks. You gotta be careful.
JORDAN: Get some tranq darts.
DONNIE: A little straitjacket.
JORDAN: What's the liability on something like this?
RUGRAT: That's a whole different thing. I can get on the phone with some people. I can talk to the insurance company and tell them exactly what we're going to do. But I think we go back to the same plan - loophole - if we don't really consider them people I think we are in the clear.
DONNIE: I think we should keep one in the office because I think they're good luck.
JORDAN: Treat it like the fuckin' thing it is. He's coming in. We're paying him for something. Treat him with respect. And you just shake his hand like you don't even think anything's wrong.
DONNIE: You just look like something else is going on.
RUGRAT: You don't look at his eyes.
DONNIE: Say "thank you for being here".
ROBBIE: You don't turn your back on him. It's a sign of disrespect.
DONNIE: If you want a cracker or something - I'm gonna have some treats in my pocket. I want to be in a strip club with you guys. Literally pull out a brief case and have a little fuckin' guy pop out of there. You know how much fuckin' pussy you The point is get it out.
JORDAN: The point is get it out.
DONNIE: Get the jokes out now. Get the fuckin' jokes out now.
JORDAN: You're gonna fuck it up. Purge all this shit right now.
DONNIE: That's what I'm saying -
JORDAN: When he comes in the room, I want him to feel like a human being -
DONNIE: Business. Business. It's fuckin' business, bro.
JORDAN: I want him to feel just like a normal human being. Cause you know - like one of us. One of us.
DONNIE: Like he's an actual human being. One of us.
JORDAN: Gobble, gobble we accept you, one of us! One of us!
ALL: One of us.
JANET: Your dad's coming. With the American Express bill.

ROBBIE: Actually, Max, my portion of the bill is hardly anything, so I'm on the same page as you
MAX: Shut the fuck up, Feinberg, you only have a portion because of my son, you worthless twerp!
DONNIE: ( chuckles ) You zip it, too, Azoff, those boiling teeth of yours are hurting my fucking eyes! ( turning to Jordan ) My own son! From my very loins! What do you think this is?
MAX: You zip it, too, Azoff, those boiling teeth of yours are hurting my fucking eyes! My own son! From my very loins! What do you think this is?
JORDAN: Will you calm down
MAX: You don't think there's any end in sight, do you? It's all one giant party to you schmendricks!
JORDAN: Donnie ordered sides.
DONNIE: Yeah, that was. Sorry.
MAX: ( glowering ) What is EJ Entertainment? What is EJ Entertainment?!
JORDAN: ( restraining a grin ) You tell me, Dad.

DONNIE: Doesn't the IRS allow for T
MAX: It's T What kind of hookers take credit cards, anyway?!
JORDAN: Give us a minute, will you, guys?
MAX: What's the matter?
JORDAN: Nothing, just. My back's been killing me. Pain shooting down my leg. Not to worry, it'll pass.
MAX: What do the doctors say?
JORDAN: Doctors, what do they know? I'm on like twenty different medications. Look, I know it's hard for you to make sense of these expenses, but there's a method here, okay?
MAX: And you have to lead by example, is that it? I'm tellin' ya, kid, one of these days. one of these days the chickens are gonna come home to In order to keep these guys working, I gotta keep `em spending. I need to keep them chasing the dream. You flash some cash, they do the same. It keeps them motivated.
JORDAN: In order to keep these guys working, I gotta keep `em spending. I need to keep them chasing the dream. You flash some cash, they do the same. It keeps them motivated.
MAX: Pissing away money? That's what motivates you kids?
JORDAN: I could afford to pay them more, but then they wouldn't need me as much. And as long as they need me they'll always fear me. I know it sounds crazy.
MAX: Crazy? This. is obscene.
CROWD: Jor-dan! Jor-dan! Jor-dan!
JORDAN: Exactly. We do our own IPO's and we will print money.

Tough-guy Donnie takes one look, then SPEWS vomit into a garbage pail. And as Chester pummels Nicholas's face into chopped Chester starts to hang Nicholas over the balcony by his legs.

In fact she's decided to throw them all away. ( parting her thighs ) So take a good look. You'll be seeing an awful lot of it around the house, but no touching.
JORDAN: C'mon, why are you doing this? I said I'm sorry.
NAOMI: ( pouting ) Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to say how wrong he is when he's ready to come in his own pants. Isn't that right Dada?

AGENT DENHAM: Agents Denham and Hughes. Your message said you wanted to speak It did. I do. Oh, they're just friends. Give us a minute, okay?
JORDAN: It did. I do. Oh, they're just friends. Give us a minute, okay?
AGENT DENHAM: Bureau forbids us from drinking at
JORDAN: I have something for you, I just gotta find it. Have a seat, will ya? Ever been on one of these
AGENT DENHAM: A boat? Learned to sail when I was I mean, one like this. Just had her extended to put a chopper on the back.
JORDAN: I mean, one like this. Just had her extended to put a chopper on the back.
AGENT DENHAM: Never been on a boat with a second mode of transportation on top of
JORDAN: Names and addresses of every guest at my wedding. Friends, clients. I even threw in the seating chart. Heard that's why you wanted the video, figured this'd expedite whatever it is you're doing. I wanted to show you I've got nothing to hide. I know you're investigating Stratton but for the life of me I can't figure out why. Sure, my company is unorthodox; what brokerage isn't? Maybe we're a little louder than most but we don't do anything illegal. Talk to the SEC, they'll tell you, they checked us out up and down.
AGENT DENHAM: The SEC's actually a civil regulatory agency. We pursue criminal activity.
JORDAN: That's what I'm saying. You guys take on real crime. Which is why I'm so curious: what do you think we did?
AGENT DENHAM: I can't discuss ongoing I understand.
JORDAN: I understand.
AGENT DENHAM: Though, to be frank, this case kinda got dumped on my desk. Some higher-up felt your shop needed looking into after all that press, fell on me to do the looking.
JORDAN: You know who you should be looking at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers,
AGENT DENHAM: that'd be great. And if there's anything you can give me just to close out your file, get it off my sure, get you back to the real then we could both profit from this little sit-down.
JORDAN: sure, get you back to the real then we could both profit from this little sit-down.
AGENT DENHAM: then we could both profit from this little sit-down.
JORDAN: You sure you don't want anything to drink? Water for your pal? Rumor is your started out in finance. Even got your broker's license before you joined the Who told you that?
AGENT DENHAM: Who told you that?
JORDAN: ( searches his memory ) Jeez, who was it.? ( comes up short ) Ever regret it? Giving up the money-crazed, pin-striped life? Ever think where you'd be if you'd stuck with it?
AGENT DENHAM: When I'm riding the subway home, sweating my balls off, in a suit I've worn three days, sure.
JORDAN: Whattaya pull in working at the bureau, if you don't mind me asking. 50-60K a year?
AGENT DENHAM: Just about. We get a free handgun out of it, though, that doesn't
JORDAN: S'crazy, the world we live in, the jobs with real value, the ones we should appreciate firefighters, teachers, FBI agents those are the ones we pay the least.
AGENT DENHAM: Way of the world.
JORDAN: That's one thing I like about what I do, the opportunity to make that right. Take this kid we had interning last year. Didn't want to be a broker, wanted to be an environmental scientist or something, he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway, his mom gets sick, all they can afford is third-rate care. Some of us got together, made an investment on his behalf and boom overnight everything changes, she's seeing the best doctors in the country. Sadly, didn't work out, she passed but still: having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth See, it's all about proper guidance, Pat. Knowing someone with the right relationships, who's discreet. I can change a life almost every day.
AGENT DENHAM: How much that intern make off your North of half a million.
JORDAN: North of half a million.
AGENT DENHAM: Can you say that again, what you told me? I believe Mr. Belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer.
JORDAN: What? I was making conversation.
AGENT DENHAM: Sounds like that to me, Jordan.
JORDAN: .no, no, no.
AGENT DENHAM: .sounded like that.
JORDAN: .no, to constitute a bribe, don't I have to make an explicit offer of money for services? With an exact dollar figure attached? All I said was "north" of half a million. According to the U.S. Criminal Code, that dog won't hunt, Pat. Heard you were a straight arrow. That you wouldn't bend the rules other agents might. He was right.
AGENT DENHAM: You did a background check on me?
JORDAN: Figured you were looking into me, was only fair. Plus you sail on a yacht fit for a Bond villain, sometimes you gotta act the part.
AGENT DENHAM: This is why you invited me down to your yacht? With a couple hookers on it
JORDAN: those are friends
AGENT DENHAM: to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you?
JORDAN: Thanks for coming down. Now get off my boat.
AGENT DENHAM: You know, most of the Wall Street jackasses I bust, they were born to the life.
JORDAN: Hey, Denham! I'm gonna eat a claw of lobster now as I get my cock sucked by Heidi down below. You have a super ride home on the subway thinking about that!
NAOMI: Switzerland? What the fuck is in Swiss cheese, Naomi, what do you fucking think?
JORDAN: Swiss cheese, Naomi, what do you fucking think?
JORDAN: ( to a Stewardess ) Sweetheart! Look at you!
JORDAN: Donnie. Donnie, wake up.
DONNIE: Untie me, shitbag. You think this is funny?
JORDAN: Untie me, shitbag. You think this is funny?
DONNIE: I didn't tie you, the captain did. He almost tasered you.
JORDAN: 146 FLASHBACK 146
SAUREL: Jordan Belfort! At last! Nicholas has told me so much.
RUGRAT: Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel.
JORDAN: Nice to make your acquaintance. This is some lobby you got.
SAUREL: Ah, yes. We gave our designer an unlimited budget and he exceeded it. Come! You must tell me all about your adventure with the stewardess over coffee!
DONNIE: We have a joke in America. "Heaven is a place where the police are Brits, the chefs are Italian, the car mechanics are German, the prostitutes are French and the bankers are Swiss." I never got it `til now look at those fucking fish! Come here, little guy.
SAUREL: Yes, we have the same joke here. Only sometimes the English are chauffeurs and the chefs are French. The Germans, alas, are always mechanics; no one wants to grant them more authority than
JORDAN: I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws.
SAUREL: Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom requires ten minutes of idle chit- chat before business can be Of course, let's get "down to it." What would you like to know?
JORDAN: Under what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an FBI or U.S. Justice Department Ca depend.
SAUREL: Ca depend.
JORDAN: Ca depend? Ca depend on what?
SAUREL: Whether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months.
RUGRAT: Want me to see if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croix?
SAUREL: The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland. But there are very few Swiss laws pertaining to your "rumored" improprieties. Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you. If the U.S. Justice Department or FBI or SEC or IRS sent us a subpoena, it would become papier-toillette. We would wipe our ass with it.
JORDAN: Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud which is a crime in Switzerland. Then you'd have to cooperate.
SAUREL: ( now he's impressed ) Yes, we would. Assuming the account is under your name. However, if it were in the name of a nominee of yours.
AUNT EMMA: ( big smile, sweating )
JORDAN: ( big smile, sweating )
AUNT EMMA: So tell me about this plan of I'd like us to go to Switzerland tomorrow so you can open an account. I'll fund it, and I'll pay you really well for your Oh my.
JORDAN: I'd like us to go to Switzerland tomorrow so you can open an account. I'll fund it, and I'll pay you really well for your Oh my.
AUNT EMMA: Oh my.
JORDAN: Next month maybe you can fly to New York and we can start moving the cash.
AUNT EMMA: Moving the cash. I feel like a character in an Ian Fleming novel. It's all quite racy, isn't it?
JORDAN: It is, and it's illegal too. Of course if you ever got in trouble, I'd come forward in two seconds, say I duped you, but even still.
AUNT EMMA: Risk is what keeps us young, isn't it darling?
JORDAN: I like that attitude. Promise me you'll spend at least ten thousand pounds per month out of the account, okay?
AUNT EMMA: ( chuckles ) I wouldn't even know how. I really do have everything I need.
JORDAN: But I bet you don't have everything you want. How about a bigger apartment so your grandkids can sleep over? Shall we sit?
AUNT EMMA: Shall we sit?
JORDAN: Sure, that'd be great.
AUNT EMMA: Sometimes I wonder if you let money get the best of you, dear. Among other substances.
JORDAN: It's that obvious, huh?
AUNT EMMA: It's the height of summer and you've got the chills.
JORDAN: I'm a drug addict, Emma. Coke, pills, you name it, whatever you got. Sex addict too.
AUNT EMMA: ( laughs ) Well there are worse things to be addicted to than sex.
JORDAN: ( chuckles; then ) Why did I just tell you that?
AUNT EMMA: ( playful ) Because I'm very easy to talk to.
JORDAN: As a matter of fact you are. My job, you know, it's tough. I mean I'm not complaining, it's just the stress. All these people depending on me. Millions of dollars at stake every day. I sometimes feel I've bitten off more than I can You're a man with large appetites.
AUNT EMMA: You're a man with large appetites.
JORDAN: I agree. I put it on myself. It's hard to control the anxiety, you know? It's hard to learn to relax.
AUNT EMMA: To release the tension.
JORDAN: Exactly, to release the tension. Sometimes you gotta learn to do what comes natural in life, huh?
AUNT EMMA: Stability, dear. Family.

BRAD: I only sell to him cuz he's your Can you just do one trip for him?

DONNIE: I can hear you, motherfucker!
DONNIE: Fu Manchu! Kung fu!
BRAD: S'cool, just. gimme the case.
DONNIE: ( he doesn't ) You know, I always kinda regretted you didn't come to work with us at Stratton. It'd be so cool having you around, man.
BRAD: ( growing impatient ) Yeah, well.
DONNIE: You'd be one of us, we'd go out- partying together, you wouldn't have to dress like a mall rat guinea prison bitch all the time.
BRAD: Give me the money.
DONNIE: Can I come over and help tape this to your wife? "Eez so focking steeky! Take eet off, Bra-hod!"
BRAD: I'm gonna give you a pass.
DONNIE: You're what?
BRAD: I'm gonna give you a pass.
DONNIE: You're gonna give me a pass?
BRAD: Yes. Just gimme the money.
DONNIE: You're gonna give me a pass? Why don't you stick your pass up your Slavic cunt's pussy.
BRAD: Donnie bolts. With no time to get to his car, Brad takes off on foot, bleeding briefcase in hand, toward a video store where he stashes his .38 in the return box.
POLICE: Freeze! Don't move!
DONNIE: Jord, do I have a surprise for you. Twenty real lemons! A retired pharmacist friend of mine's been sitting on these the last 15 You fucking serious?!
JORDAN: You fucking serious?!
JORDAN: Start with one, see how it goes?
DONNIE: My guy says one's all we'll need.

JORDAN: Why, what's
BO DIETL: Leave the house, call me back from a pay phone, you hear me?
JORDAN: Yeah, I'm at a pay phone. What's going on?
BO DIETL: Your buddy Brad's in jail.
JORDAN: Oh, Jesus Christ! What did he do?
BO DIETL: I dunno yet, they arrested him in a shopping mall in Long Island this morning, I'm finding out. But listen to me. More important than that. The guy Denham I told you about, the Fed? He's got your phones tapped, I'm pretty sure. Home and office.
JORDAN: Donnie, that piece of shit. I'm gonna kill him! That fat prick mother fucker!
BO DIETL: But, listen to me. Do me a favor, please do not talk on the phone.
JORDAN: BO DIETL BO DIETL

DONNIE: Fuck it. Jordan releases Donnie. Donnie crawls into the dining room and starts shoving ham into his mouth in an effort to sober up. Just then, we HEAR a horrible GAGGING sound. Donnie holds his throat as he falls backward choking, taking out the entire glass kitchen table with a tremendous CRASH! Naomi rushes back in.

JORDAN: BROOKVILLE POLICE #1
MANNY RISKIN: You're a lucky guy, Jordan. Legally I've never seen anyone slip a noose the way you do. Christ, you're lucky to be alive much less not in jail.
JORDAN: I don't believe in luck.
MANNY RISKIN: That's what all lucky people say. It's time, Jordan. Let me make a deal with SEC. Before your luck runs out.
JORDAN: What kind of terms?
MANNY RISKIN: You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations stock manipulation, high pressure sales tactics, ticky-tack shit like that. You pay a few million dollars in fines and in exchange the SEC fucks off for all time.
JORDAN: And Stratton? What happens there?
MANNY RISKIN: You'd have to walk away. Let Donnie take over. Now the FBI's a different animal. They can still pursue you for criminal wrongdoing. But with you on the sidelines, my guess is your best friend Agent Denham'll be left standing around with his dick in his hand.
MAX: You beat them, Jordan. You won. Sail into the sunset with your wife and kids while you can.
MANNY RISKIN: God knows you'll never have to work again.
JORDAN: I'm sure many of you have been hearing rumors lately, about me, about the future of this firm, and that's what I'd like to talk to you about today. Five years ago when I started Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day would eventually come when I'd be moving on. It's truly with a heavy heart that I tell you that day is here.
DONNIE: ( jumping in ) Why would anyone in their right mind not follow JB's advice?
JORDAN: Before I go, there's something I want to remind you all, and that's this Stratton Oakmont is bigger than any one person, even me. Especially me. You guys are Stratton, each and every one of you, and that is why it's sure to remain the best brokerage firm in the fucking world!
KIMMIE: You wrote me a check for $25,000!
JORDAN: Because I believed in you, like I believe in each and every one of you!
KIMMIE: I love you, Jordan!
JORDAN: You know for years I've been telling you guys not to take no for an answer, to keep pushing, to not hang up the phone till you get what you want. This deal I'm about to sign, barring me from the securities industry, barring me from Stratton, my home. What the fuck is that? I'll tell you what it is, it's me being a hypocrite. It's me taking no for an answer, it's them selling me, not the other way around! Fuck it, I'm not leaving!
HOSTESS: Can I get you anything else, I have a rare condition that requires me to drink one of these every fifteen minutes. If you could set your egg timer, I'd appreciate it. Rugrat! Bongiorno, my bald eagle!
JORDAN: I have a rare condition that requires me to drink one of these every fifteen minutes. If you could set your egg timer, I'd appreciate it. Rugrat! Bongiorno, my bald eagle!
DONNIE: Rugrat! Bongiorno, my bald eagle!
RUGRAT: We may have a problem. Your friend, Steve Madden, he's unloading shares.
DONNIE: What?! You're fucking kidding?!
RUGRAT: No. I wish I was.
DONNIE: ( to Jordan ) Rugrat says Steve Madden's unloading shares.
JORDAN: What?! ( Grabs Donnie's phone ) Rugrat, what the fuck?
RUGRAT: I'm looking at the screen and huge chunks of Steve Madden are being sold. We're not doing it so it's gotta be Steve. He's the only person who owns that many shares.
DONNIE: He's not picking up.
JORDAN: Your fucking friend is trying to fuck me. And you know where he's trying to fuck me? Up the ass. I need some time to think.
JORDAN: Tell all the brokers to sell. Drive the price down. Steve will go cockless when he watches me turn his company into a penny Captain Ted!! Start `er up, we gotta go home!
NAOMI: I got a call from cousin Betty. Aunt Emma's dead.
SAUREL: It is terrible. Your aunt was such an elegant, attractive woman. My condolences to you and your family. You must be
JORDAN: ( no time for it ) Thanks but where does this leave us in regard to her account? It goes into probate or what?
SAUREL: Not to worry, Jordan. Your aunt, before she died, signed a document naming you as her successor.
JORDAN: She did?!
SAUREL: ( a sly grin ) Well. Not as of yet.
JORDAN: Captain Ted! Change of plan! We're going to Monaco.
NAOMI: Monaco, now?
JORDAN: Yes, babe. We're going to Monaco so then we can go to Switzerland.
HILDY: But her aunt just died, we can't go to
JORDAN: I realize that but we have to go to Switzerland.
DONNIE: What about
JORDAN: ( way ahead of him ) keep calling, when the fuck picks up, set a meet with him in three business days.
NAOMI: We gotta go to London.
JORDAN: The funeral.
NAOMI: The funeral.
JORDAN: Honey, I loved your Aunt Emma more than anyone in the world, but she's still gonna be dead in two days. She's not going anywhere.
CAPTAIN TED: Then we drive to Switzerland so they don't stamp our passports. Take care of business. Drive back to Monaco, fly to London for the funeral, fly back to New York to be there in three business days - That's the fuckin' plan.
JORDAN: Then we drive to Switzerland so they don't stamp our passports. Take care of business. Drive back to Monaco, fly to London for the funeral, fly back to New York to be there in three business days - That's the fuckin' plan.
CAPTAIN TED: I'm getting reports of some weather out there. Might run into some chop.
JORDAN: The boat's 170 feet long. She can handle a little chop.
HILDY: We're not going anywhere until he says it's safe.
DONNIE: Chop is fine.
JORDAN: Is it safe?
CAPTAIN TED: If we take it slow.
JORDAN: We can do it?
CAPTAIN TED: Chop is chop. Some chop - it can be uncomfortable.
JORDAN: Well, that's fine.
CAPTAIN TED: Anything is possible. I mean we'll have to batten down the hatches just to be safe. Could be a few broken dishes.
JORDAN: A few broken dishes. Isn't that great? Let's go to Monaco -
JORDAN: What the fuck is going on?
CAPTAIN TED: Jet skis just went overboard.
RADIO VOICE: Gale warning! Gale warning!
CAPTAIN TED: The waves are twenty feet and Can't you turn us around?!
JORDAN: Can't you turn us around?!
CAPTAIN TED: We'll get broad-sided and tip Gale warning! Gale warning!
RADIO VOICE: Gale warning! Gale warning!
NAOMI: You happy now, you piece of shit? We're gonna drown.
JORDAN: I'm a master diver. We will not drown, I promise you. I got you, The ludes!
DONNIE: Get the fucking ludes!
JORDAN: Get the fucking ludes!
DONNIE: They're below deck! There's like three feet of water down there!
JORDAN: I can't die fucking sober!
NAOMI: What is he crazy? Where's he going? Donnie!
CAPTAIN TED: Jesus Christ!
JORDAN: What's happening?!
CAPTAIN TED: Rogue wave!
NAOMI: Dinner's ready.
JORDAN: I gotta finish these balance sheets, babe.
NAOMI: Well, it's there. So the kids are gonna start.
JORDAN: At the essence of every personal interaction, of every business transaction, of every effective human communication is PERSUASION. once you learn to control the linguistic encounter, you will be SHOCKED at what will happen. you are a person worth listening to, and taking it one step higher than that, you are someone who can help them achieve their goals.
MAN: I have here in my hand, framed, is a check for twenty-seven thousand four hundred and thirty-seven dollars and sixty-three cents that I netted from one deal after attending Jordan Belfort's, um, Straight Line Persuasion seminar.
JORDAN: There's nobody stopping you from making millions. There is nobody holding you back from financial Thank You Sweet Heart. Don't just sit at home or the life of your dreams will sail right past you.
HUSBAND: Thanks to the Straight Line System, we could afford this home and now we're living the lives of our dreams.
JORDAN: So come to my seminar!! The life of your dreams is only a decision
NOLAN DRAGER: This is.well, it's not good. It's pretty bad actually. How much money do you have, Jordan?
JORDAN: I can make bail.
NOLAN DRAGER: I don't mean the ten million, I mean for legal fees. Cuz if you want to fight this thing, it's gonna be expensive. Like, sell-
JORDAN: Nay, thank God. I'm so glad you're here.
DONNIE: Hey, everybody! How're the happiest people in Long Island? Hi, Rocky!! Hate that fucking dog.
JORDAN: Tell me about it. It's getting old, starting to shit inside the house again.
DONNIE: How you doing, brother? How was the food in jail?
JORDAN: Lobster Newburg sucked. They gave me some jewelry though.
DONNIE: Wonder if they got one in my size. Fuckin' Rugrat, that wig-wearin' hump. Tell you one thing: I'm never eating at Benihana's again. Where's Naomi?
JORDAN: Inside. Pissed.
DONNIE: What's up her ass?
JORDAN: Had to mortgage the home to make bail. Probably gonna hafta sell it to pay my lawyers. If we fight this thing.
DONNIE: The Feds say anything about coming after the rest of us?
LUCAS SOLOMON: There's a term we have around here, we don't like to use it often, only when circumstances dictate. It's called a "Grenada." Inspired by our government's invasion in 1983 of the island nation of only 90,000 people, basically it stands for any case we get which is pretty much unlose- able. We could show up late and drunk to court, fuck up left-right- and-center and still we'd win. Mr. Belfort, you, sir, are a
ROCHELLE APPLEBAUM: You're looking at real prison time. Money laundering gets you as much as 20 years. Case couldn't be stronger if we'd have caught you with your cash in your
LUCAS SOLOMON: Read the discovery.
JORDAN: That your life's work in the box?
AGENT DENHAM: Jordan, you rotting in jail til your kids're outta college isn't our ambition here. You weren't the only one involved in all this. We think those folks deserve their day in court too.
NOLAN DRAGER: Why do I get the sense there's an offer in the air? If so, let's put it on the table.
LUCAS SOLOMON: Full cooperation. A comprehensive list of all coconspirators spanning the last seven years and he agrees to wear a wire.
JORDAN: You want me to rat?
LUCAS SOLOMON: We want your cooperation in
AGENT DENHAM: Yes. We want you to rat.
JORDAN: How was Christy's party?
NAOMI: It was fine.
JORDAN: Baby, I talked to the lawyers again today. I have some really great news. As it turns out you're totally off the hook.
NAOMI: I know that already.
JORDAN: You never did anything wrong anyway, right? At the end of the day all they really want is for me to cooperate - that's it. See, apparently, I know so much about what's going on in the stock market that I could save the government years of heartache. But it get's even better. You see, if I cooperate I'll only have to serve four short years and any fine I'd have to pay wouldn't be due til after I serve my sentence. We'll still have plenty of money left over. The only thing that I was kind of upset about was the fact that I might have to give them information about my friends.
NAOMI: Like you said, "There's no friends on Wall Street".
JORDAN: But there's a silver lining to that too. It turns out that all of `em are probably gonna cooperate too. So in the end, that won't really be a factor.
NAOMI: Well, that's really good news, honey. I'm really happy for you.
JORDAN: No, it's good for both of us, Nay.
NAOMI: Yeah, yeah.
JORDAN: Make love to me baby. Make love to me nice and slow.
NAOMI: No Jordan. Stop!
JORDAN: I love you, Nay. I love you so much. I've loved you from the first time I saw you.
NAOMI: Fuck you.
JORDAN: I fucking hate you.
NAOMI: I fucking hate you.
JORDAN: What are you talking about?
NAOMI: You don't give a shit about how I feel. All you care about is That's not true. What do you mean?
JORDAN: That's not true. What do you mean?
NAOMI: You wanna fuck me? Fine. Fuck me hard like it's the last time.
JORDAN: Hold still. Why are you moving like that?
NAOMI: Go ahead, fuck me!
JORDAN: What are you doing baby?
NAOMI: Cum for me. Cum for me, baby. Like it's the last time.
JORDAN: You want me to cum, baby?
NAOMI: Yeah, cum for me baby, cum!
JORDAN: What are you talking about?
NAOMI: I want a divorce.
JORDAN: What? What are you talking about? Now? After we just made love?
NAOMI: And I wanted to puke.
JORDAN: You don't love me? Isn't that convenient. Now, you don't love me? Now while I'm under federal indictment with a fucking bracelet around my ankle? Now, all of a sudden, you decide you don't love Yes, that's right.
NAOMI: Yes, that's right.
