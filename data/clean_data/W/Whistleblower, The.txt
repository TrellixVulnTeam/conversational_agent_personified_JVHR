WIFE: Really. It was nothing.

KATHY: I'd like to take a quick walk through the You can't do that without a warrant.
HUSBAND: You can't do that without a warrant.

HUSBAND: You're not coming in my house!
DOCTOR: Painful there?
HAWK: I'm her Captain.
DOCTOR: Her collar bone is broken. And I'm going to have to set her arm in a cast.
HAWK: Lookin' for a route to the desk?
KATHY: Yeah, I'm gonna break every bone in my body until I'm captain.
HAWK: I wish.
KATHY: Just when my self esteem was gettin' so We found a boy locked in the basement. Badly beaten. We charged the husband with domestic assault. You made the right call. But you should've waited for backup. ( sighing ). I wish I didn't have to say this

KATHY: You're giving Deke the gold shield.
HAWK: I have to Kathy. He has seniority.
KATHY: That gold shield was the first one in four years. Sir. I'm going to have to resign, and take that position overseas.
HAWK: I think that's a mistake. I want you on my team.
KATHY: Frank, I'm nearly forty. I can't be on the streets much longer. Not if I don't know there's something on the other end.
HAWK: Just think about it, will you?
ERIN: I wish you could stay here.
KATHY: Me too.
ERIN: I mean it's fine living at dad's, but. Now I really won't see you for a while.
KATHY: I'm doing this for us. If I have a better job, I can give you guys more.
ERIN: When do you have to decide?
KATHY: Come here.
ERIN: Are you sure it's not dangerous?
KATHY: Of course. It's been four years. Things are getting back to normal over there.
CARMEN: Sniper Alley. See, the bullet marks are at eye level. People just running to the
BILL HYNES: You have been hired by Dyncorp Aerospace International to represent the US as monitors for the United Nations, which means you are the only national contingent coming from a private military. So you people chose to come here. And for the next few weeks, we will teach you how to protect the rule of law in a war zone, how to rebuild a civil society brick by brick.
TODD MYERS: We are still in the process of disarming the Muslim, Croat, and Serb militias. You will be cataloguing these arms for decommissioning records.
BILL HYNES: But today is a new day. As Head of the United Nations Mission here I trust that we stake our highest values, even our lives, on the belief that we can rebuild, we must renew, we will witness the rebirth of this country.
KATHY: I thought this was peanut butter but
CARMEN: It's ass paste? I know. I bought it too. Let's get out of here. I need a drink.
AMERICAN IPTF: That's a military Bar. You want the party in there.
CARMEN: Fuck me, we're outnumbered. Good odds.
KATHY: Hon, they're all yours.
CARMEN: Okay, fine, if you insist. Mine's a
JAN: What about you? You don't have an order?
KATHY: No. I'm the polite one.
JAN: I like polite.
CARMEN: I'm gonna be the drunk one. Let's get
ITALIAN SOLDIER: I'd pay double for a woman in uniform.
KATHY: Sorry pal, I'm not for sale.
JIM HIGGINS: Lucky those wops don't carry guns or we'd've had ourselves a situation. Fucking unarmed mission. I was hoping we'd get to squeeze some off.
TODD MYERS: At who? Better odds you'll step on a land mine and what the hell's a gun gonna do for you then?
JIM HIGGINS: ( embarrassed ) I'd kill the fucker who buried it.
TODD MYERS: You ever had to take someone down?
KATHY: Just once.
JAN: You should probably get her home.
KATHY: You probably shouldn't have let her drink that much.
JAN: Hey. I. don't worry. I know those guys. Nothing was going to happen to her.
KATHY: Well I did. And now we're both leaving.
CARMEN: What the hell happened last night?
KATHY: Let's move. We're gonna be late.
CARMEN: Do you have any idea where we are?
JAN: Late night ladies?
KATHY: Feel free to sit wherever you like.
BOSNIAN WOMAN: Sorry I am late. I'm your interpreter.
KATHY: Great, well. I just asked them to sit.
BOSNIAN WOMAN: They like to be difficult. They understand if you're clear. Mostly they have trouble speaking English. But let's see if you can get them to talk at all.
KATHY: Okay, I'm going to be talking about crime scene investigation today. If we could
KATHY: Actually, you sign the attendance at the end of the session. It's a UN mandate
DANIK: Or we sign now?
KATHY: We sign later.
KATHY: .Keeping the crime scene clean is number one.
DANIK: We sign sheet now?
KATHY: We have to go to the hospital together.
KATHY: We got here as quick as we could.
CLARKSON: Seems we have two stabbings, one shooting, and a man with a broken leg and a bad hangover who can't remember what happened. Average night back in
KATHY: What did he say?
VIKO: She is Muslim. He said she deserved it.
CLARKSON: Alright, that's it. Everyone out.
KATHY: ( at Clarkson ) Isn't she filing a
KATHY: She has to file a complaint. A woman gets stabbed in the face and there are no
CLARKSON: Quit it! You hear me?
CARMEN: Come out. You can't solve this tonight. I'm not taking no for an answer.
VIKO: Zlata Sehik has been to the hospital eight time because of her husband. Every time she try to file a complaint, my bosses send her back. They always laugh at the woman. They laughed at my mother. They do not make prosecutions of domestic violence. I want to get enough evidence to do this.
KATHY: With no police reports?.. Maybe, if you go back to the hospital. You can pull the records for every one of her visits.
KATHY: Okay, now get the same thing from all the doctors who treated her. They will have to testify on Zlata's behalf.
KATHY: This is good. Let's cross reference each injury with other cases where felony assaults were ruled. Can you get something like that?
KATHY: Sorry, you wanted to see me?
JAN: Madeleine Rees wants to see you. Head of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
KATHY: What? Why?
JAN: I'm sure it's fine. You followed protocol, right?
MADELEINE REES: Don't mind Helen, she's a total sap.
KATHY: Ms. Rees, I
MADELEINE REES: Madeleine. You've been stirring things Is this about Zlata Sehik? If I've overstepped protocol
KATHY: Is this about Zlata Sehik? If I've overstepped protocol
MADELEINE REES: You have done in two months, what we've been trying to do for years.
KATHY: 45 INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - NIGHT 45
CARMEN: I can't believe they're moving you into the city. I'm so jealous. So where's your Mission Headquarters. UNMHQ.
KATHY: Mission Headquarters. UNMHQ.
CARMEN: But Madeleine is UNHCHR, right?
KATHY: ( smiling ) I know. I don't even know if I'm still IPTF.
CARMEN: Well I don't give an F.U.C.K. All I know is I'm gonna miss you. Stay in touch with the little people!
RICK JONES: I'm glad to have an American in the mix. You'll be reporting to me.
KATHY: Oh. I, I thought I was reporting to Madeleine Rees' Office.
RICK JONES: It's a joint office. She's Human Rights. But you're Police Task Force. So you go through me. But we all report to Bill Hynes anyhow.
RICK JONES: Yeah, your ah. predecessor's files. We're waiting for Archives to get those out of here. I'll put another call in.
KATHY: It's fine. Thanks for the tour.
RICK JONES: Great. I'll leave you to it. Good luck.
JAN: I was wondering when you'd ask me out.
KATHY: It's not a date. No, seriously. It's not. I know you had a lot to do with my promotion, so I wanted to thank you.
JAN: Here's to not dating.
KATHY: Listen to me. I'm not joking around. You're a nice guy. But I.
WAITRESS: You are certain you have everything you
JAN: We're fine thank you.
KATHY: You must be in heaven over here.
JAN: The war left behind a lot of widows.
KATHY: You don't find that
JAN: I find it uncomfortable. A lot of guys don't. I don't know what else to say about it. Now finish your sentence, I'm a nice guy but
KATHY: I can't afford to mess this up.
JAN: It's only dinner. How bad can it get?
KATHY: Ask my two ex-husbands.
BARRY: This is the first time they've seen their homes in years.
KATHY: They're all widows?
BARRY: That's why they were so frightened to come back.
KATHY: Except us.
BARRY: I always thought helping refugees get home would be one of the best parts of the job. But it's so hard for them.
KATHY: Thanks for taking me through this. Fill me in when you're done, and I'll send my report to Rick Jones.
KATHY: It's okay, it's
FIELD WORKER: I found her out in the woods. She was speaking, I don't know, she's not local. I think she's one of the girls from the
BARRY: It's a bar in the hills.
KATHY: Yeah. Good. I'll follow up at the bar.
KATHY: What's going on here?
KATHY: Hold on. Where are the IPTF monitoring this raid?
KATHY: Is that the owner? Are you taking him into custody?
LOCAL COP: Xivy slovic drinjnislava porslivky.
KATHY: Is there a translator on the scene? Translator?. Wait.
KATHY: WALKIE VOICE ( O.S. )
KATHY: Hey. I'm from Gender Affairs. I
FRED MURRAY: Hey. Fred Murray.
KATHY: Is that the owner? ( off Fred's nod ) I tried to get an interpreter but
FRED MURRAY: No, no. that's fine. We're pretty much done here anyway.
KATHY: Oh. Okay. But there's. We just had two girls come in to a Human Rights Office, saying they escaped from this
FRED MURRAY: Yeah. Local police have been watching the place for a while. This whole thing happened pretty fast. I guess those girls must've run for it.
KATHY: Well, the girls in our field office seemed pretty scared. I should follow up with these ones.
FRED MURRAY: You can see where they're taking them, but I can't intervene. You know the
KATHY: Thanks. I'll look out for your report.
KATHY: TWB 32.
KATHY: Foreign objects?
MILENA: Coins. She's not the first. Men can feel deficient paying for sex, so they find other ways to feel powerful.
KATHY: When will he know?
MILENA: Unfortunately that's all we can do for her. We're just a volunteer organization.
KATHY: But if there are so many victims.
MILENA: We lost our funding because of those.
KATHY: But these girls aren't prostitutes.
MILENA: They don't realize the cycle they start. If there are no condoms in the bars.
KATHY: Where can they get help?
MILENA: Try the Global Displacement Agency. They have good medical care, lots of funding. They might take them. Whether they'll keep them or not. I don't know.
KATHY: Where are the other girls from the Florida bar?
MILENA: Those girls never arrived.
CARMEN: Hey, where've you been?
KATHY: I'll tell you about it over a drink. Could you just check something for me? I want to get a copy of the monitor's report from a raid on the Florida Bar
CARMEN: Your job is so exciting. The only thing I get to raid is the fridge. ( Reading off the computer ). You sure there was a raid? There's no record here.
KATHY: No. That's definitely it. There were six girls removed from the bar and I need to know where they were taken.
CARMEN: Sorry. No record of any raid.
KATHY: I'm looking for Fred Murray?
FRED MURRAY: We meet again!
KATHY: Is it okay for me to be here?
FRED MURRAY: Sure, sure. You're fine here on the gravel. What's going on?
KATHY: I just wanted to follow up with you on the raid yesterday. Those girls didn't show up at the Shelter, and I wanted to locate them.
FRED MURRAY: Yeah, the whole thing was a bit of a mess. Turned out it was a local police mistake. Mix-up with the tip off or something. Thought they had a prostitution bust, but the bar is legit and those girls were just waitresses.
KATHY: Waitresses aren't kept under lock and
FRED MURRAY: Shit. Can we go over this later? I got to get in there.
KATHY: Kathy. The new Head of Gender Affairs.
LAURA LEVIN: I heard. Laura Levin. My assistant will take them to the medical center. As soon as they get medical clearance we'll know where we stand.
KATHY: What do you mean?
LAURA LEVIN: Well, it's yet to be determined if they'll cooperate with the repatriation program. That's the only way I can allow them to stay at the GDA.
KATHY: They're critical. witnesses for a situation I'm. monitoring. I'll need to speak with them when they're ready.
LAURA LEVIN: I understand. I'll be in touch.
KATHY: Will you be contacting their parents?
LAURA LEVIN: I didn't know there were any others.
LAURA LEVIN: We have located her.
KATHY: Go home.
KATHY: How can you go up there, when you know what happens to these girls?
JAN: It was a good-bye party. I was
KATHY: They're thirteen, fourteen, fifteen
JAN: I know. If you let me finish, I got a call. Some friends needed a lift home because they got drunk. But hey lady, you better wake up! EVERYWHERE is a brothel. The coffee shop down the street. The post office. My corner store. That's how it is here. I'm not interested, and I try and stay in clean places. And if you don't believe me, then fuck you.
KATHY: No. I'm not okay. These girls. What are these guys thinking?
HALYNA: I need to borrow money.
ZENIA: I'll get you the money. But you have to go. Roman will be home soon. He won't give it to me if he knows it's for you.
KATHY: Fred Murray. There were other officers too. But the raid was not in the books. These girls were just sent back. They are clearly not waitresses. They are victims. I think IPTF were paid off to turn a blind eye.
RICK JONES: That's a serious allegation. And you don't have any evidence. I can't open an investigation based on a hunch.
LAURA LEVIN: We can only send you home, but what you choose to do after that is up to you.
LAURA LEVIN: I'm sorry, but my role here is to get you home. Otherwise you stay in Bosnia, where you. could face charges for illegal
IRKA: I will sign.
KATHY: Raya and Irka could be key witnesses in a UN investigation. I thought we were all on the same team.
LAURA LEVIN: Irka can stay. But I can't keep Raya here. She is refusing to cooperate in the repatriation program.
KATHY: Please, just let her stay two weeks. Then we can take it from there.
LAURA LEVIN: We only house fourteen girls. It's a valuable spot.
KATHY: Two weeks. If she's going to testify, she's not safe anywhere else.
KATHY: There is another option. I want to help you find your friends. But you need to help me do that.
RAYA: The translator starts. Raya stops her. Frustrated. Turning to Kathy is humbled. She looks at Raya, open, raw.
KATHY: I have a daughter, just your age. I wouldn't stop until I found her.
RAYA: I only left because. there was nothing, no jobs, no. chances. I was good in school. But with no money. My mother. She is on her own. She works so hard. But nothing changes. I thought I could help her. He said we would work in a hotel. With good wages.
KATHY: Do you know this man?
RAYA: He is not the only one. They come every month. Tanjo give them money, so they don't raid the bar. That day you come. Tanjo did not want to pay. They want to punish him. Take his money. His girls. I
KATHY: I need to get evidence. How many girls do you have here?
MILENA: At least thirty five.
KATHY: Do you have any more pictures?
KATHY: Erin. What are you doing?
KATHY: Yeah. I just was thinking about you.
ERIN: Okay, can I go back to bed now?
KATHY: Yeah. Of course, I just. It's great to hear your voice.
RICK JONES: How're things?
KATHY: Busy. I followed up on the Florida Bar. It's worse than I thought. There was a protection racket. IPTF. Americans, Romanians, were taking pay-offs to make sure the place wasn't busted. That raid was a punishment bust, because the owner stopped paying. But he must've settled it because the girls are right back where they started. Locked up in the hills.
RICK JONES: Okay, let's back up a second here
KATHY: I've got two girls ready to testify about IPTF taking pay-offs
RICK JONES: Testify where?
KATHY: In court.
RICK JONES: A Bosnian court? Not gonna happen. All International Personnel have immunity.
KATHY: I know. But there must be some channel, some exception
RICK JONES: Look, you've done really good work here. These are serious allegations. Let me look into how to handle it. I'll get back to you.
JAN: It's different for us. We're all military or police. Every contingent except for the U.S. if someone does something wrong, they have to answer to a military tribunal at home. With the Americans. your Dyncorp guys? I don't think you have So the Americans aren't legally accountable for anything?
KATHY: So the Americans aren't legally accountable for anything?
JAN: To be honest, I think our superiors would keep it quiet too. I mean, I haven't seen a military tribunal.
KATHY: To do what?
JAN: I was just. This place, y'know, it gets to you. I'm, I'm worried what will happen to you a year from now.
KATHY: You don't need to worry about me.
JAN: Someone does. So Fred Murray could just walk up to a man and shoot him in daylight and he'd never see the inside of a courtroom?
KATHY: So Fred Murray could just walk up to a man and shoot him in daylight and he'd never see the inside of a courtroom?
JAN: In Bosnia, yes. but. I mean, something that public could get him sent home. And tried in his own country.
MADELEINE: Helen loves it here. I think she has Olympic ambitions.
KATHY: I wanted these girls to testify in a trial against the IPTF officers. But
MADELEINE: The immunity problem.
KATHY: Okay, but if the girls testify in a Bosnian court against their trafficker. Tanjo. they'd have to mention what else goes on in the brothels.
MADELEINE: It could work. If you make certain that in their testimony they mention every sordid detail of IPTF involvement
KATHY: That is their testimony. Then it would be on record. Somebody would have to pay attention. Like.the State Department?
MADELEINE: They're gonna answer for this.
KATHY: .and the two girls have to go to the hospital to get immunized, or they can't stay in the country. I need an armored security vehicle.
LEWIS: You're lucky you have a car at all. We're stretched to the limit. Besides, isn't this a local police matter? Try them.
KATHY: I'm looking for
VIKO: It's no problem. The Van is just sitting here. Let's go.
KATHY: ( at Laura ) Where's Irka?
LAURA LEVIN: I need to have a word with you.
VIKO: I'll take her. Meet us when you're done.
KATHY: I'll be right behind you. Are you okay?
LAURA LEVIN: I was going to call you. There was a problem. During our repatriation procedures, we realized Irka had no So we get her one. Where is she?
KATHY: So we get her one. Where is she?
LAURA LEVIN: You don't get it. She was trafficked from Belgrade. Her parents were killed in Kosovo. And she has no documentation. No embassy will recognize her. She is a girl without a country.
KATHY: She is a witness for a UN investigation!
LAURA LEVIN: We handed her over to the police a few hours ago. I couldn't keep her. I've already done every favour I could for you. This is not on me.
KATHY: You had no right to do that!
LAURA LEVIN: I had every right. We have a system that works here. You're the one disrupting it.
KATHY: Where did they take her?
HALYNA: Walks in. Disoriented, emotion rising.
KATHY: If you know anything, this is on you.
INTERN: I think the cops leave them somewhere near the border, so that with no papers, the girls have to cross the border illegally. Take the 103 to Visegrad.
KATHY: I'm looking for a girl. She was dropped here a few hours ago.
GUARD: Lady. I know what you're looking for. Those girls do not go through the border. They go through there.
KATHY: Irka's legs start to give. Kathy gains on her.
IRKA: Please. let me die.
BARRY: Okay. We've got a safe house in the mountains. Nobody knows she's here, so we're clear to take her there now.
KATHY: Let's go back to the Florida Bar
VIKO: You think he'd be that stupid?
KATHY: I don't care! I have nothing else to go on, do I?
VIKO: They moved them already.
KATHY: At the end of her rope.
KATHY: She's fifteen. I'm begging you
FRED MURRAY: I don't know what you're talking about.
KATHY: If you know any of the other bars he owns, anything. I'm appealing to
FRED MURRAY: Hey. I'm gonna say this one more time. And you can put this down in your investigation on me. I don't know what you're talking about.
SECRETARY: I've called and paged. He says he can't get into this now.
KATHY: Does he know that one of my witnesses was abducted? Where is he?
SECRETARY: Sorry Kathy, he really didn't tell me.
MADELEINE: It's not your fault.
KATHY: Irka won't testify now. It's completely understandable. She's way too scared. I just. I don't know what to do with her. The GDA won't take her and her traffickers will find her if she's in this city.
MADELEINE: Maybe it's time for a little diplomacy. Do you have a nice frock?
KATHY: Really? You think it's okay?
JAN: You're beautiful.
CARMEN: You can stop standing like a farmer's wife for starters. These people are dignitaries. You gotta up your game.
KATHY: Is there a specific way of addressing the High Commissioner of the Mission?
MADELEINE: I call him Bill.
MADELEINE: ( familiar ) Mrs. Ambassador! How do we do?
JANET WELLS: We do what we can. Great to see you
MADELEINE: I hope you don't mind, I've brought along a friend. This is Kathy Bolkovac.
JANET WELLS: Great. I need as many gal pals as I can get. Look at this place.
AMBASSADOR WELLS: What are your thoughts on dinner?
JANET WELLS: I think people are still busy drinking.
AMBASSADOR WELLS: Speaking of, what can I get you ladies?
KATHY: Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Ah, I'll have a wine please.
AMBASSADOR WELLS: ( nodding ) Coming right up. Madeleine, white for you?
KATHY: Oh I. I just needed some air.
PETER WARD: Trust me, I know the feeling. I hate these stuffy events. You never know anyone's agenda.
JANET WELLS: They just left her there? At the border? Poor girl. Just the psychological trauma. How can I help?
KATHY: She's very vulnerable to re-trafficking. Internationals got her in this situation. We owe her the chance to get out.
MADELEINE: We want to repatriate Irka to the United States and find her a foster family. I was hoping you could use your influence
JANET WELLS: We're going to find her a home.
KATHY: I also think the American embassy should be aware of some of the problems we're having with our officers.
MADELEINE: Your help with Irka's case can really raise awareness in the Mission around the issue of trafficking.
BOY: What is it?
TANJO: They're downstairs. I want to get them out today.
BASEMENT: TWO MEN stand guard. Tanjo walks past them. Opens a door. Ushering Ivan INSIDE where.
BARREN ROOM: And see. Raya. NAKED. HELD DOWN BY FOUR MEN. SPREAD EAGLE ON HER FRONT. WAILING. HER FACE SHOWS UNIMAGINABLE PAIN. And we see that. Two of the men holding her down are EXTINGUISHING LIT
RAYA: But we realize. this is not the greatest cause of her pain. Luba's face whitens. Eyeing one MAN at Raya's backside. A flash of shame in his eyes as he steps away from Raya, and drops. A PIPE onto the ground. The men step away. Leaving Raya. Collapsed into a ball. Now the girls all understand. there is no hope at all.
MADELEINE: The young woman, who shall remain anonymous, arrived in Bosnia as a victim of sex trafficking and has survived horrific abuse.
REPORTER: Now that the UN is finally recognizing sex-trafficking, how are you going to monitor it?
MADELEINE: Nothing on Raya?
KATHY: I've sent an APB out to all police stations and UN field offices. But I'm pushing ahead with the other girls in Milena's shelter. I'm creating a photo- line-up using the UN ID database, so they can identify all internationals involved. We've got to make them accountable.
KATHY: I have a favour to ask.
CARMEN: You have access to all transport vehicle checkouts, right?
KATHY: You have access to all transport vehicle checkouts, right?
CARMEN: I'm a fountain of useless knowledge.
KATHY: Can you see how often Fred Murray has checked out raid vehicles?
CARMEN: Fred Murray?
KATHY: What? Why didn't anyone tell me. Is he being disciplined because of my
CARMEN: He's just gone. Meaning investigation over. They wanted him out of here. People are talking. Come on, let's get some
CARMEN: Kath, you gotta be careful. Look, I know you're doing your own thing and all, but you're investigating your colleagues.
KATHY: You've seen what they're doing.
CARMEN: I know. I know. I just, the stuff people are saying, I'm catching snippets, and I'm worried about you. Think about your
MONITOR: Looking for you in Human Resources.
BLAKELY: I'm John Blakely, Human Resources.
KATHY: ( deadpan ) A bit.
BLAKELY: Would you say you're under extreme Excuse me?
KATHY: Excuse me?
BLAKELY: There are concerns among some of your superiors that you've become impulsive, reckless in your position.
KATHY: Are you suggesting I take time off. Or are you telling me?
BLAKELY: This is simply out of concern for you.
KATHY: Consolidate my leave. A fucking
JAN: Nobody who knows you could think that.
KATHY: Really? I'm losing witnesses, suspects. It's one step forward, two steps back.
JAN: It's not what. It's who. You know them.
BACK BEDROOM: He bangs on a wall. FIVE GIRLS wake in cots on the ground. He motions for them to go in. They do.
JULIA: Don't let him see you like this.
TANYA: What's your name?
JULIA: No! He sent a girl back three months ago. I was here! ( to Luba ) What is your name?
RAYA: ( softly ) Her name is Luba. Luba Pankiw.
KATHY: She starts RIPPING through them all YELLOW STICKY NOTES on all of them.
JIM HIGGINS: They've called an assembly for all Dyncorp personnel.
JIM HIGGINS: Anyone know what this is about?
RICK: I have some not so pleasant news, but bear with me. ( Off a prepared statement ) Lately, local police have raided some houses of `ill repute' and a number of `ladies of the evening' have been taken into custody. While the credibility of these witnesses is questionable, apparently photo line-ups have been made available to them.
KATHY: You've given every officer time to create an alibi.
RICK: I'm not going to subject my men to this witch hunt based on the testimony of some hookers! Prostitution is illegal! Your witnesses are criminals.
KATHY: They are SLAVES. By any American or International law.
RICK: These slaves are lying about their presence in Bosnia. You are coming after American Officers with baseless claims.
KATHY: .you know they're not baseless.
RICK JONES: If you've got a problem, go call the Ambassador's wife.
JAN: They hired you to do a job they don't want done. It's a P.R. position.
KATHY: Rick publicly outed me, jeopardizing those girls. I have to go over his head. But I. I never thought I'd have to go into Internal Affairs. The guys back home would never understand this.
JAN: I understand you.
KATHY: Yeah? And how long do you plan on being around, because the last two guys who said that aren't here.
JAN: It's just I waited so long you know. I want my kids to know I did something, to be proud.
KATHY: It's just I waited so long you know. I want my kids to know I did something, to be proud.
JAN: They are.
KATHY: No. Your kids are proud. You go on this mission and you're a big hero. I go and I'm a bad mother. ( tearing up ) I can't believe I'm gonna disappoint them again.
JAN: So don't.
MALE MONITOR: What can I do for you?
KATHY: It's, I need to speak in-camera with a senior IA official. I don't have a name,
MALE MONITOR: Just a moment please.
KATHY: I did a photo ID line-up with victims who testified to international patronizing of brothels, as well as complicity in trafficking itself.
OFFICIAL: I haven't seen those.
KATHY: He shakes his head, standing.
OFFICIAL: It's possible they're still in the pipeline, in preliminary processing. I'm sorry to have to rush this, but I have to get to a meeting. Thanks for coming in.
KATHY: Hello?. Sorry, who is this?. Just one
KATHY: That was you today, in IA?
PETER WARD: ( nodding ) Would you like a drink?
KATHY: What's this?
PETER WARD: Your file.
KATHY: I don't understand.
PETER WARD: They're investigating you.
KATHY: Why?.. There has to be some sort of an international court or body that can turn this around
PETER WARD: The United Nations. You're here.
KATHY: I don't want a scandal. I just want
PETER WARD: NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOU. It's designed that way. No oversight. No national or international accountability.
KATHY: Dyncorp's Headquarters are in England
PETER WARD: Exactly. Nothing leads back to the State Department. That includes you. So if something were to happen to you it wouldn't even make the news at home. No one would ever know. Poof. You're gone.
RORY: You feel like a party?
RAYA: ( forcing ) Yes. of course.
ANSWERING MACHINE: Click. Click. Click.
KATHY: This is. I can't believe your timing.
JAN: It's a rotation. They're sending us back a month early. I tried to get an extension, but.
KATHY: I'm not even sure I'm staying.
JAN: If that's what your instincts are telling I have children, I have to think about
KATHY: I have children, I have to think about
RAYA: I was just trying to
LUBA: Don't. You'll get us in trouble.
MIKE SEARS: How's my favorite girl?
RAYA: I am good. Everything good.
IVAN: Ten times normal. Pay upfront. And extra deposit. But you cannot take her.
SUIT 1: You're on.
FRANZ: I'll keep an eye out.
JAN: Get outta here.
FRANZ: Anything you need you call, okay? He'll kill both of us if you don't.
JAN: You come to me. when you're done.
MADELEINE: What's this I hear about you leaving?
KATHY: How'd you
MADELEINE: The Dutch Officer rang before he left. C'mon, I want to show you something.
MADELEINE: After we got Irka repatriated, I had some calls from other private parties that were interested in helping. We've gathered $40,000 so far. I've applied for matching funds, so that. we can completely rebuild this shelter.
MILENA: Separate from the GDA. We run it our way. The victims come first.
MADELEINE: Things are changing Kathy.
SHELTER VOLUNTEER: There's an important call inside.
MILENA: Excuse me.
SHELTER VOLUNTEER: No. The call is for Kathy.
THE OASIS: He scans the room. His eyes land on Luba. Raya watches Ivan nod to Luba. A silent exchange: Luba accepts Mara's role. SUDDENLY. HONKING. OUTSIDE a car speeds up. The two SUITS from last night appear at the door. Without the girls.
JULIA: Oasis Bar. In mountains.
VIKO: Should I call for a raid?
KATHY: No. He'll walk. We have no proof they were trafficked. Let me talk to them. See what else they know.
ASSISTANT: That's their first cut. I'll pass on your notes, and they should have it ready for the grant proposal in time.
KATHY: I have no options right now. The GDA is more secure than Milena's shelter. Can they stay before you do the paperwork?
LAURA LEVIN: They'll go on record?
KATHY: And you're saying these soldiers brought you into Bosnia. Through the border? You're sure?
JULIA: Yes. In a van. White van. Like yours.
KATHY: They had uniforms? Like mine?
JULIA: April 8. I never forget. The day I leave my home. We come to Bosnia some day later. I know because we stop at the border. We were six of us. Men from the border, they opened the doors. We give them our fake passports. My name was Irena Woycek. I thought they would see the fake passports, I thought.
VIKO: If there are records showing those girls came through the border with IPTF
KATHY: Then you have conspiracy to traffick. And I can take it to Bill Hynes. That's enough to do a raid that will stick.
VIKO: The main border station keeps the logs.
VIKO: Best if it looks like a local matter. Get more info. You be my UN monitor, okay?
VIKO: So when a vehicle is stopped, you'll keep all this on file here?
BORDER COP: Of course! It's our fucking job!
VIKO: And other stations up the border send all their files to you?
BORDER COP: Some do, some don't. Fifty-fifty chance.
KATHY: That's it. Conspiracy to traffick.
KATHY: We arrest the buyer first. The bar-owner. The border log corroborates the victims' testimony. Once he's in custody, we raid his place and get those girls out.
RECEPTIONIST: He shouldn't be long now.
KATHY: That's why I came straight to you. They were brought across the border by our guys. I need two back-up security vans for a raid, with well-trained
BILL HYNES: Our resources are tight. I have to ( holding the border logs ) This is real evidence. And that's just a drop in the ocean. I have hundreds of files. Photos, corroborated statements. We can build this case and get the perpetrators out of the mission
KATHY: ( holding the border logs ) This is real evidence. And that's just a drop in the ocean. I have hundreds of files. Photos, corroborated statements. We can build this case and get the perpetrators out of the mission
BILL HYNES: If I could give you a piece of advice it would be to think of the future.
KATHY: These girls
BILL HYNES: Are Collateral Damage. Whores of War. It's nothing new. Every conflict produces You know as well as I do, those girls aren't a product of the war.
KATHY: You know as well as I do, those girls aren't a product of the war.
BILL HYNES: This is your first mission. You're eager. But we work in a very grey area and that can get messy. Everybody wants the UN to take the gloves off but they don't want us to get our hands dirty. It's a fucking Catch-22. So what do we do? We prioritize. We do our best and we always look at the bigger picture. You're a mother. Fine. I see what you're doing with these girls. Maybe that's why you're thinking with your heart not your head. But you have a chance at a career in the international sector. Ride this out. Get a promotion. Human Rights in Liberia, Afghanistan. I don't give a shit. And then, when you're running the show, you can implement whatever changes you see fit. But right now be smart and shut this bullshit down!
KATHY: ( to Viko and other cops ) Try and get him outside first, then arrest him. Once you've got him outta there we'll go in. I want the girls to know they're safe.
VIKO: We have a warrant to search this premises. The owner of this bar Ivan Bladzic has been arrested and taken into custody for human trafficking.
BARMAN: Fuck you!
KATHY: You do not have to be afraid of Ivan Bladzic. He cannot hurt you now.
VIKO: Fakes. Bad ones.
KATHY: We want to get you out of here safely. That is my absolute priority.
RAYA: Kathy looks at the all girls. Their eyes flitting between Mike and Kathy. And she understands. Kathy REELS around. Grabs Mike by the collar SHOVING him to the door SLAMMING him against the wall.
KATHY: Who the fuck are you? What have you done? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? You fuck!
MIKE: Get off me, you crazy bitch!
KATHY: They're supposed to TRUST US!
VIKO: C'mon Kathy. It's over.
KATHY: I know this girl. I know her. We can't leave them here. We're supposed to
VIKO: If they won't come, we can't force them. Nothing will hold up in court. They'll be returned and punished. Do you want blood on your hands?
MILENA: And our matching funds go to the GDA.
MADELEINE: ( shaking her head ) The State Department money monster. Ironic, isn't it? That the very people whose money we need to fund a shelter to protect these girls, are the exact people they need protecting from.
ACADEMIC: More often than not, traffickers prey on those they know. Banking on the fact that a girl will trust them. Traffickers are fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles and
ZENIA: Roman, he does. I'm
KATHY: Erin?. No. Nothing's wrong. I just needed to. I needed to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry if you ever felt I wasn't there for you, but. I love you.
KATHY: It is time to face the truth of what is happening. We can right our wrongs, and move forward, ashamed, but accountable and transparent.
LUBA: He's gonna kill you. Go! Go!
MAILBOX FULL: In the INBOX: EMAIL after EMAIL. All with the same subject:
CONSCIENCE: 223 INT. BILL HYNES' OFFICE - UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY 223
BILL HYNES: What is this?
KATHY: An email I wrote.
BILL HYNES: The actions I am taking are for your own benefit. We are seeking your repatriation back to the United States.
KATHY: ( stunned ) You can't
BILL HYNES: I'm doing this for your own good.
KATHY: She leaves. Without signing anything.
BILL HYNES: I'm starting to get a fucking headache. All your people do is gender.
MADELEINE: Right. It is a core function of the Gender Office.
BILL HYNES: The email? It seriously concerned me. The level of recklessness she used speaks volumes toward her mental state. This is for her own good.
MADELEINE: Bullshit. You can't just fire her without cause. You need a reason that would stand up in court!
BILL HYNES: She's burned out Madeleine!
MADELEINE: She is not burned out, she's being
BILL HYNES: You hired her. You keep her under control. You've always wanted to run this your way. But I'm not going to let anyone interfere with the way I run my mission!
MADELEINE: Then start running it with some integrity! It's your people perpetrating crimes against humanity!
BILL HYNES: Madeleine. Drop this. It's coming from above my head.
MADELEINE: This is coming from Washington?
BILL HYNES: Yes. They want her out.
FRANK: Let's go. Like nothing's wrong.
KATHY: He's powdering my car.
JAN: The door handles too? Check thoroughly to see if there are any prints before you get in that car tomorrow. Kathy, are you
KATHY: So you know how we talked about living together..? It may be a bit sooner than we planned.
JAN: Kathy, maybe it's time to come home.
MADELEINE: It's bollocks. Absolute and total. You have signed a contract with Dyncorp Aerospace Operations U.K. And there is no provision under English law for summary dismissal without due process or an investigation.
KATHY: They tell me. people disappear. They bug my house. I mean, I'm sitting here, worried there's a bomb in my car
MADELEINE: We can fight this.
KATHY: This isn't just my career, it's my life. I don't know if I'm ready to be a That's exactly what you are.
MADELEINE: That's exactly what you are.
KATHY: She eyes Madeleine, pointed. Madeleine sits back.
MADELEINE: I don't know what to say to that. Think about this. Let me know what you want to do. I'll support you either way.
KATHY: What do I do?
MADELEINE: Hand in an appeal. Keep reporting to work. Watch how they respond. Build your case. And catch them in their lies.
SECRETARY: Ms. Bolkovac. I, me and the other secretaries. Your email was the bravest thing anyone's even done in this mission.
MORGAN: Get something on her! Get anything!
KATHY: If you could just go into my office, I'll give you a key to the cabinets.
CARMEN: Kath. my parents really need the money I send home. It's a lifesaver for them. My Dad has medical bills. I'm so sorry.
KATHY: You don't have anything smaller?
KATHY: Yes, this is Kathy Bolkovac and
AMBASSADOR WELLS: I can hardly hear you. Can you yell-
KATHY: OK. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW? YES. GO AHEAD. THIS IS KATHRYN BOLKOVAC. I WANTED TO DISCUSS MY TERMINATION THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND THE IPTF. OK. IT'S JUST THAT I WAS TOLD YOU MET WITH MR. HYNES ABOUT ME. THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE! WHO TOLD YOU THAT? I BARELY RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME. I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
AMBASSADOR WELLS: YES. GO AHEAD. THIS IS KATHRYN BOLKOVAC. I WANTED TO DISCUSS MY TERMINATION THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND THE IPTF. OK. IT'S JUST THAT I WAS TOLD YOU MET WITH MR. HYNES ABOUT ME. THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE! WHO TOLD YOU THAT? I BARELY RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME. I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
KATHY: THIS IS KATHRYN BOLKOVAC. I WANTED TO DISCUSS MY TERMINATION THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND THE IPTF. OK. IT'S JUST THAT I WAS TOLD YOU MET WITH MR. HYNES ABOUT ME. THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE! WHO TOLD YOU THAT? I BARELY RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME. I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
AMBASSADOR WELLS: THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND THE IPTF. OK. IT'S JUST THAT I WAS TOLD YOU MET WITH MR. HYNES ABOUT ME. THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE! WHO TOLD YOU THAT? I BARELY RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME. I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
KATHY: OK. IT'S JUST THAT I WAS TOLD YOU MET WITH MR. HYNES ABOUT ME. THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE! WHO TOLD YOU THAT? I BARELY RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME. I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
AMBASSADOR WELLS: THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE! WHO TOLD YOU THAT? I BARELY RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME. I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
KATHY'S OFFICE: Peter Ward stands in front. He can't look her in the eye. Kathy slips her hand into her pocket. Fumbling. Then looks up. She's got it. ECU of TAPE WHEELS turning. Kathy moves forward. Coming closer, she sees behind Peter.
KATHY: Timesheet Violations? They are firing me for time sheet violations!!!
PETER WARD: You should go.
KATHY: I'm not going anywhere. Not without an investigation. Madeleine Rees is
PETER WARD: Hynes has sent a delegate to Vienna to have Madeleine Rees removed.
KATHY: Can you repeat that?
PETER WARD: Look, this is between you and me, but Dyncorp and the State Department. you know it's a dual thing, and this is the action they have taken, whether right or wrong. I'm being told to do this.
KATHY: So you're saying the State Department is instructing Dyncorp to fire me.
PETER WARD: She turns. Peter stands over her. Eyeing the tape recorder.
THE ELEVATOR: Quickly looking around THE METAL PANELING. She drops the bag. An ECHO REVERBERATES through the HOLLOW SHAFT. Kathy turns.
RICK JONES: I'm gonna tell you this in front of him and everybody else, you no longer have a UN ID. You no longer have a UN job. You do not have a job with the Department of State. The Department of State holds your contract. They are the ones who are pulling it. You will not have an appeal. You will not have a hearing. You will not have anything. Do you understand?
BILL HYNES: I can categorically state that not one United Nations Officer has been involved in the trafficking of a single woman.
TIM: Are you saying that you believe all these victims' claims to be false?
RICK JONES: Any unused footage. Use it all. I want the press flooded with EPKs.
REPORTER: What do you say to rumors that Dyncorp are working to have you removed?
MADELEINE: Try me. These raids are for show and completely amateurish. This is the biggest cover-up I have ever seen!
SIDE STREET: 240 Narrow. TWO PEOPLE WIDE.. Keeping her eyes to the ground. 240
KATHY: I have everything you need. When I arrive in Amsterdam safely, I will go on record.
TIM SEBASTIAN: We talked to Bill Hynes, who was the senior UN official in Bosnia at the time, we talked to him a year ago, on this program about some of your allegations. He said they weren't true at all. He said 'We've had senior officials from New York, we've had investigations from the State Department. I can now categorically say that not a single UN official was involved in trafficking'.
KATHY: I think that Mr. Hynes knows this is a false statement.
TIM SEBASTIAN: So you're accusing him of lying. That not a single word he said is true.
KATHY: I watched that. Yes.
TIM SEBASTIAN: Would you do it again?
KATHY: Yes I would. No doubt about it. I would definitely do it again. I'm not the type of person who would. As a law enforcement officer, I am held to a higher standard.
