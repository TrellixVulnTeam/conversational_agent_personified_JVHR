SHOOTING DRAFT: FADE IN: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT A quiet upper-middle class neighborhood. The CAMERA is at the curb, looking down the street. There are no sidewalks. Trees arch overhead. CICADAS drone on the soundtrack. The OPENING TITLES briefly FADE IN and OUT, framed by the trees on either side of the street. Footsteps are heard As the picture TITLE FADES, out of the dark emerges a GIRL 17 years old, carrying schoolbooks. This is JILL. CAMERA PANS with her ninety degrees as she comes to the front of a house and stops. Lights are on in the bottom half of the house, and the curtains across the windows are open. A single light burns in the upper right side of the house, presumable in a bedroom, but the curtains in the room are drawn. A scene TITLE appears on the lower half of the screen: The TITLE FADES, and Jill heads up the walk to the front door of the house. The light in the upper floor of the house is turned off.
WIFE: Where's the girl?
DOCTOR: I only called her ten minutes ago
WIFE: ( passing into living room ) I made our reservation for 8:15. We're going to be late.
DOCTOR: Here she is now.
JILL: Dr. Minakis?
DOCTOR: Mandrakis. It's okay. Everyone gets it wrong the first time. You're Jill? Come on in.
JILL: ( entering ) Thank you.
WIFE: I've written the number of the restaurant on the notepad by the Zip me up, will you please? If we aren't home in two hours, it means we've decided to go on to a movie and won't be back until after midnight. Is that all right?
JILL: ( helping wife on with her coat ) I've told my service to pick up any calls coming in to my office phone.
DOCTOR: ( helping wife on with her coat ) I've told my service to pick up any calls coming in to my office phone.
WIFE: The children are asleep upstairs first door on your left at the top of the landing. They're both just getting over a cold so try not to wake them.
JILL: Do you have any questions?
WIFE: Do you have any questions?
WIFE: We have to go now. We're late.
DOCTOR: Make yourself at home. The refrigerator's loaded.
WIFE: ( pulling doctor through the door )
DOCTOR: We even have some low-fat yogurt.
DOCTOR: The doctor pulls the door shut behind him. Jill turns toward the living room. Pause. She walks into the living room and sets her books down on a table with the telephone on it. O.S. we hear the car doors close, the engine start up, then the car backing out the driveway and heading down the street.
JILL: NANCY ( O.S. ) ( out of phone ) ( beat ) ( into phone again )
JILL: All right.

JILL: I guess. I haven't looked around very much.
JILL: No, they were asleep when I got here.
JILL: You didn't happen to talk to Billy today, did you?
JILL: Did he say anything about me? I don't know what you did to him, or said to him, or what. but he's really pissed off at you! What did you do?
JILL: It's what I didn't do.
JILL: Do me a favor, Nance.
JILL: Do you think you'll be talking with Billy some time tonight?
JILL: That isn't what I had in mind.
JILL: Nancy, all you want to do is come over here and get drunk.
JILL: ( mimicking ) Who? Me?
JILL: I've got a lot of work to do. I don't want you coming over!
JILL: You are my friend. Yeah. I guess so.
JILL: Listen, just give Billy the number here, but don't tell him I told you to. Okay? Okay. I've got to go now.
JILL: Okay, Nancy. Bye. And thank you.
JILL: There is a brief pause; then the line goes dead and a dial tone cuts in. Jill hangs up and goes back to work. The phone rings again. Jill picks it up.
JILL: A VOICE speaks on the other end of the phone.
JILL: The line goes dead. Dial tone. Jill hangs up and goes right back to work.
JILL: DUNCAN ( O.S. )
JILL: Mrs. Mandrakis?
JILL: DUNCAN ( O.S. )

JILL: No, I'm just the babysitter.
JILL: SACKER ( O.S. )
JILL: SACKER ( O.S. )
JILL: No, I. You're probably right. It's nothing to worry about.
JILL: No, the people I'm babysitting for might try to reach me.
JILL: Okay. Thank you.
JILL: Jill hangs up. After thinking for a moment, she tries a couple of ways of whistling as loud as she can, but frustrated and feeling foolish, she soon gives up.
JILL: DUNCAN ( O.S. )
JILL: I called you before. about the man who keeps calling me?

JILL: I want to talk to you.
JILL: Leave me alone!
CLIFFORD: Are the parents here yet?
CLIFFORD: ( beat ) What a homecoming!
GARBER: We were only a block away when the call went out. When we got here, the guy was still waiting upstairs in the children's bedroom. He was covered with blood.
CLIFFORD: Not his own. The children had been dead for several hours.
GARBER: Not his own. The children had been dead for several hours.
CLIFFORD: He'd been using an old phone in their bedroom that the parents had never had disconnected.
GARBER: He'd been using an old phone in their bedroom that the parents had never had disconnected.
CLIFFORD: Who is he?
GARBER: We found a Merchant Seaman's card on him. He's English. Entered the country less than a week ago.
CLIFFORD: How about the babysitter?
GARBER: She's going to be all right.
MASTER: So you're in business for yourself Yes, sir, for the past three and a half years.
CLIFFORD: ( quietly ) Yes, sir, for the past three and a half years.
MASTER: That's good. And you'd heard about Curt Duncan's Oh, yes.
CLIFFORD: Oh, yes.
MASTER: Do you think the police will. find I know they haven't assigned anyone to it specifically. It's an old case.
CLIFFORD: I know they haven't assigned anyone to it specifically. It's an old case.
MASTER: ( a tinge of bitterness ) An old case. ( beat ) Can you find him?
CLIFFORD: Yes. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this week, but I'll find him.
MASTER: He could be anywhere by now.
CLIFFORD: I don't think so. because he's a foreigner. He'll come back to the city. After six years in confinement, it's the only place that's familiar to him. That's important. A man murders two children in cold blood. A jury declares him insane. How could such a person not be?
MASTER: A man murders two children in cold blood. A jury declares him insane. How could such a person not be?
MASTER: He is sent to a state mental institution where the security is. less than perfect. And he escapes. It. it isn't fair.
MANDRAKIS: A thing like that should never be allowed to happen again.
CLIFFORD: I couldn't agree with you more.
MANDRAKIS: Go ahead then. My accountant will contact you.
CLIFFORD: Thank you. How is Mrs. Mandrakis?
MANDRAKIS: She is. unable to have any more I'm sorry. Please give her my best.
CLIFFORD: I'm sorry. Please give her my best.
MANDRAKIS: Of course.
DR. MONK: Eventually, anyone will respond to the treatment here.
CLIFFORD: You gave him electric shock?
DR. MONK: Yeah, we zapped him a few times. It's fairly standard.
CLIFFORD: It says here thirty-eight. thirty- eight times.
CLIFFORD: What will happen to him now, without the drugs he was on?
DR. MONK: There'll be some deterioration. That's inevitable, but we can't say how
CLIFFORD: During the time that you had him here, did you discover any particular habits of his, peculiarities, quirks, anything that might help me find It's all in the folder.
DR. MONK: ( shrugging again ) It's all in the folder.
CLIFFORD: Any letters from people back in England? Family?
DR. MONK: That, too, is in the folder.
CLIFFORD: Let's get something straight here, Doctor. I've been 33 years in the business of tracking people down and putting them away. I spent almost a year on Curt Duncan alone, with the trial, the testimonies, the background investigations. I didn't come here today to look in your goddamn folders. In fact, I wouldn't have come here at all if you'd done your job right. Mr. Clifford, this is a hospital, not a penitentiary. Everything that pertains to one of our patients is meticulously recorded in that patient's folder. whether you can make sense of it or not.
DR. MONK: Mr. Clifford, this is a hospital, not a penitentiary. Everything that pertains to one of our patients is meticulously recorded in that patient's folder. whether you can make sense of it or not.
DR. MONK: Curt Duncan is a classic paranoid- schizophrenic. They see themselves as victims, and they always blame other people for the way they are. When Duncan killed the Mandrakis kids, it wasn't an act of hostility against the children but against their parents. He was getting back at his own parents for traumas he suffered in early childhood. The criminal side of Curt Duncan is one of terrible, symbolic vengeance.
CLIFFORD: ( looking up ) Assuming he isn't found right away. what will happen to him?
DR. MONK: I think you'll find him. Somebody will find him. He can't function out there. He'll make a mistake. This is where he belongs. After six years in here, he's suddenly gone out to confront the world again. I think he's in for a bit of a shock.
RETIRED MAN: Rackin' 'em up today, Bill? Doin' all right.
BILL: ( over his shoulder ) Doin' all right.
HANK: C'mon in and shut the door.
HANK: ( after a moment ) What'll it be? ( pause, no answer ) Hey! What'll it be?
DR. MONK: Ordinary street clothes. Not all of our patients have to wear the green Gucci gowns.
CLIFFORD: Did he have any money with him?
DR. MONK: Probably. But not more than, say, fifty dollars. Some of the patients are given little jobs around the ward, for which they are paid. It's part of the rehabilitation.
DR. MONK: It's a psycho-motor dysfunction.
CLIFFORD: Duncan had it?
DR. MONK: Only from time to time, which is What is it?
CLIFFORD: What is it?
DR. MONK: It attacks the nervous system. People suffering from it are irresistibly compelled to utter obscenities, sometimes one, sometimes a whole string of them. They can't control Are you being serious?
CLIFFORD: ( somewhat taken aback ) Are you being serious?
DR. MONK: Yeah. Here, I'll give you an example.
DR. MONK: Duncan never had the twitch that sometimes goes with it. And with Duncan, as I said, the disease would only manifest itself in periods of extreme anxiety. When he was really flipping out, in other words.
CLIFFORD: Duncan was Catholic?
DR. MONK: ( beat ) So am I.
CLIFFORD: ( mildly surprised ) That makes three of us.
DR. MONK: Is that right? So we all share the same guilt.
DR. MONK: Here. This is Curt Duncan shortly after he was admitted here in 1972.
DR. MONK: ( to Clifford ) That's Duncan.
TRACY: ( sotto voce ) A little action for your game?
BILL: ( sotto voce ) What, him?
TRACY: I wouldn't bet against you.
BILL: What's the matter? You don't like me playing with myself?
ON TRACY: She takes her pack of cigarettes from the purse. She pulls out a cigarette, taps it lightly on the bar, puts it to her O.S. we hear the sound of a match being struck.
WIDER ANGLE: Duncan is standing beside her holding a lit match. He shoves it forward at her. It goes out. Duncan fumbles for another match as Tracy regards him with undisguised repulsion. Duncan gets the second match lit and holds it out for her. She accepts the favor and lights her Duncan smiles. Tracy nods and turns away. Duncan is still holding the burning match for her to blow out. As it doesn't look like she's going to, he lets it drop, still lit, to the REACTION SHOT - BARTENDER He gives a look as if to say, "Jesus, what a fuckin' weirdo".
DUNCAN: No response.
DUNCAN: What you been up to?
TRACY: ( looking at him ) My own business. ( beat ) Thanks for the light. Okay?
DUNCAN: Next round's on me.
TRACY: ( annoyed ) Listen, mister, I've got my own money. So, if you don't mind.
DUNCAN: After what I been through, I don't mind anything.
DUNCAN: See, that's the whole point. My mind. Your mind. Where do they fit in? You know what I mean?
DUNCAN: ( setting her drink before her ) Do you live around here?
TRACY: Get offa me!!
REACTION SHOTS: Even Bill now looks up from the pool table. His expression ANGLE ON BAR Tracy has clammed up her elbows on the bar, head between her elbows, arms covering her ears, hands clasped behind her neck. Duncan looks at her nervously and starts to talk again:
DUNCAN: ( rapidly ) Listen, I didn't mean nothin'. I don't live around here. See ?
WIDER ANGLE: The air is charged with tension.
BILL: I think an apology is in order.
BILL: That the best you can do?
BILL: I think you'd better just move along,
HANK: He'll be okay now, Bill. He just
BILL: No! I want him out of here!
BILL: ( to Duncan ) Go on, beat it.
REACTION SHOTS: As the tension builds.
BILL: I'm not going to say it again, mister.
BILL: Who're you calling?
BILL: ( calling after her ) You're welcome, baby! ( to Hank )
BILL: ( to Hank )
OLD MAN: Good riddance to bad rubbish, eh,
HANK: ( apologetic ) A fight breaks out, there's gonna be damages. Insurance company doesn't pay without a police report.
BILL: You see any damages?
BILL: See ya 'round.
HANK: ( into phone ) No, it's over now.
MAN: ( calling out ) Donna. Donna! Hey! ( under his breath ) What the hell !
"SURPRISE!": A broad smile breaks across the man's face. We may recognize him as the cop from six years ago Charles Garber. Today he is a lieutenant on the force and dresses casually for work, usually in slacks, turtleneck and jacket.
GARBER: ( genuinely surprised ) What is all this?!
SCATTERED VOICES: Happy birthday, Charlie!
WOMAN'S VOICE: Look at him!
MAN'S VOICE: Don't shoot us, Charlie!
GARBER: ( chagrined ) How was I supposed to know?
GARBER: Will you tell me what this is about, Yeah, in a minute.
CLIFFORD: Yeah, in a minute.
GARBER: I don't think I can take any more of these surprises.
GARBER: Okay now, what's the big deal?
CLIFFORD: Stand still. I want you to remember this in the morning.
GARBER: If you want me to remember something in the morning, then tell it to me in the morning.
CLIFFORD: Charlie, come on.
CLIFFORD: No. I got a job today, tracking That's great, Cliff; I'm sure you'll find your man.
GARBER: That's great, Cliff; I'm sure you'll find your man.
CLIFFORD: It's Curt Duncan.
GARBER: ANGLE ON BABY Kicking and wiggling about.
CLIFFORD: I need your cooperation on this one.
GARBER: Sure. Anything.
TRACY: Oh, it's you! What do you want?
DUNCAN: ( moving forward ) .Came to apologize. I.
TRACY: Look, I'm the one who should be sorry. I didn't want that to happen. Oh, God! Look at you. Are you all
DUNCAN: I'm new in town. Don't know anybody.
TRACY: ( uncomfortable ) Where're you from?
DUNCAN: ( coughs ) New York. Ever been there?
TRACY: Sure. Sure I've been there.
DUNCAN: Kind of a mean place to be. Everyone cold, unfriendly.
TRACY: ( over her shoulder ) Excuse me.
TRACY: ( nervous ) .No, I just got in. I don't know if I can. Listen, I can't talk now. Can I call you back?. Okay.
DUNCAN: I'm not from New York, actually. But I'm very, very far from home.
TRACY: Look, you can't come in here. I thought we might get some coffee. Can I buy you ?
DUNCAN: ( mumbling ) I thought we might get some coffee. Can I buy you ?
TRACY: I don't think so.
DUNCAN: Someplace nearby?
TRACY: Not tonight. You'd better go.
DUNCAN: I got no place to go.
TRACY: ( anxious ) You can't
DUNCAN: Just, just a little coffee?
TRACY: Maybe tomorrow.
DUNCAN: Okay, tomorrow. When?
TRACY: I said maybe. I don't know. Listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon. I really am. All right? That was my boyfriend on the phone. He's coming over. So please leave.
DUNCAN: I like you.
TRACY: ( her voice rising ) Look, do you want me to call the ( standing ) It's okay. It's okay.
DUNCAN: ( standing ) It's okay. It's okay.
DUNCAN: I'll see you later. sometime. I still want to buy you that drink.
CLIFFORD: Jesus, I don't recognize anybody.
GARBER: Three years is a long time in a place like this.
CLIFFORD: Three and a half.
WC: Hiya, Cliff. Howya doin'?
CLIFFORD: ( taken aback )
GARBER: How long will you be here?
CLIFFORD: Depends on how lucky I get. I'll only be coming around once, maybe twice a week.
GARBER: You want to use your old desk? Someplace to sit down?
CLIFFORD: ( surprised ) Is it vacant?
MAINTENANCE MAN: Okay, man, move it out. Let's go.
CHEATER: Wha ?
OLD WOMAN: There's another one down there.
MAINTENANCE MAN: He nudges at whatever's inside the nook with his foot.
MAINTENANCE MAN: ( nudging again ) Come on, bright eyes. Wake up. Wake Jesus Christ! What happened to you?
WIDER ANGLE: As the maintenance man guides Duncan to the door.
MAINTENANCE MAN: I'm sorry, man, but you can't stay in here. Go out to the park, lay in the sunshine. You'll feel better.
MAINTENANCE MAN: God bless it! Hey!
MAINTENANCE MAN: Out. Out. Out. Out. Out.
CHEATER: ( angry ) All right! All right!
CHEATER: Whaddya say, pardner. I'm dry as a bone. You got any money?
CHEATER: You neither, huh? My name is Morgan, but it ain't J.P. Guess I better go to work. Take 'er easy now, pardner.
TRACY: Who is it?
TRACY: A what?
TRACY: What do you want with me?
TRACY: I've got nothing to say about anything or anybody. Listen, lady, I can be back in thirty minutes with a search warrant and a handful of cops, and I can probably have you arrested, whether or not the charges would stick. Now do you want to let me in and talk?
TRACY: Have you got a badge?
CLIFFORD: I don't carry a badge. I'm issued a license, a piece of paper, and I left it at home. You're Tracy Fuller?
CLIFFORD: Can we sit down?
CLIFFORD: Do you recognize this man?
TRACY: Clifford lets out a sigh of frustration, realizing that this woman will continue to be difficult.
CLIFFORD: He's escaped from the insane asylum. In 1972, he murdered two children. broke into a house and found them asleep in bed. It was a little boy, five an a half, and a little three- year-old girl. After the coroner's investigation, their bodies were taken to the mortuary, where the undertaker took one look at them and said he couldn't have their bodies reconstructed for the funeral without six days of steady work. Then he asked what had been the murder weapon, because looking at the mess in front of him, he couldn't imagine what had been used. The coroner told him there had been no murder weapon. The killer had used only his hands. The undertaker went to work and had them done in four.
CLIFFORD: What's the matter?
TRACY: ( barely able to say it ) He's been here.
CLIFFORD: Let's play it safe. Let's assume that he will.
HANK: You again?
CLIFFORD: What are your hours tonight?
HANK: No hours. Bar's closed on Mondays.
CLIFFORD: I want you to be open if that's No way. Monday's my night off. Come back tomorr.
HANK: ( closing the door ) No way. Monday's my night off. Come back tomorr.
CLIFFORD: ( through clenched teeth ) This is tomorrow! Now what are your
GARBER: ( looking up ) Any luck?
CLIFFORD: I've come to say goodbye, and thank You found him?
GARBER: You found him?
CLIFFORD: I think so.
GARBER: From here on, I go it alone.
CLIFFORD: From here on, I go it alone.
GARBER: What's the point of chancing it, Cliff? We'll let you take the credit.
CLIFFORD: Pause. Clifford sits down.
CLIFFORD: I'm going to kill him, Charlie. The closer I get to this guy, the more I. It gets to me. I don't I think you'd better go on home, Cliff. You've fallen in.
CLIFFORD: The closer I get to this guy, the more I. It gets to me. I don't I think you'd better go on home, Cliff. You've fallen in.
GARBER: I think you'd better go on home, Cliff. You've fallen in.
CLIFFORD: No. Not this time. This is the case that makes up for a whole career. If you can't understand it now, you will in a few years.
GARBER: What part does money play in all this? Play straight with me. For what I'm being paid, it's not out of line.
CLIFFORD: ( shrugging ) For what I'm being paid, it's not out of line.
GARBER: Who's hired you for this?
GARBER: ( cynically ) So you're a hitman now.
CLIFFORD: ( passionately ) He murdered two kids in cold blood. You were there, too.
GARBER: You could get busted.
CLIFFORD: I understand that.
GARBER: What are you going to use?
CLIFFORD: Jimmy needles.
GARBER: You're stretching our friendship, Cliff. If you blow this at all
CLIFFORD: You'll never hear from me again.
GARBER: Take your time. Do it right.
CLIFFORD: Don't worry.
GARBER: Do you need any help preparing for this thing?
CLIFFORD: ( standing up ) I'm ready. I'm just trying to think where he could be in the meantime.
WAITRESS: What happened to you?
WAITRESS: You get mugged?
DUNCAN: Snubbed, the waitress comes back and sets the cup in front of him. She looks down at the change on the counter. There isn't enough.
WAITRESS: Coffee's twenty-seven.
WAITRESS: ( pulling away the cup ) Coffee's twenty-seven cents. Ya got it or don't ya?
WAITRESS: Okay, buster, one cup. On the house.
WAITRESS: Drink it and be on your way.
WAITRESS: You're welcome.
DUNCAN: No, thank you.
CHEATER: Well! I can't say much for your protocol, but your timing's dead on. Here's to you, pardner.
CLIFFORD: ( to all the bums ) I'm looking for an old buddy of mine, English fella. Name's Crazy Curt. Any of you guys seen him?
CLIFFORD: I owe him some money.
CHEATER: Aaahh. Show me an honest man.
CLIFFORD: ( gesturing ) Stands about so. Brown hair. Face kind of banged up. Was in an accident.
CHEATER: Oh, yeah? I was just with that guy, not more'n an hour ago. Looked bad. Crazy Curt, huh?
CLIFFORD: Cheater scratches his head, and glances anxiously down the Clifford shakes his head.
CHEATER: Hell, I can't remember. Prob'bly see him again though. Tell you what. You leave the money with me, I'll see he gets it. as a favor to you.
CLIFFORD: I have to talk to him.
CHEATER: Whatsa matter? You don't trust me? I'll have you know I used to be a college professor. We can work
CLIFFORD: Sure. Keep the bottle. I'll be back.
CHEATER: "Long life to the grape! For when summer is flown, The age of our nectar Shall gladden our own." That's Shelley, you know.
CUSTOMER: Hey, Hank, what're you doing open Trying to make a buck.
HANK: ( relaxing ) Trying to make a buck.
HANK: Keep it, honey. My treat.
CUSTOMER: ( under his breath ) That how you make a buck?
CLIFFORD: ( coming forward: half- whispering ) No luck. You see him?
CLIFFORD: He still could be out there, though.
TRACY: ( softly ) Oh, God.
CLIFFORD: Are you all right?
TRACY: I'm okay.
CLIFFORD: I'm going to hang around outside for awhile. I'll be back on and off again all night.
CLIFFORD: Are you sure you're okay?
TRACY: I'm fine.
CLIFFORD: All right. Bolt your door. Don't let anybody in, no matter what.
TRACY: I'll be seeing you. Listen. Thanks.
CLIFFORD: I'll be seeing you. Listen. Thanks.
TRACY: Tracy closes the door and throws the bolt. Then she walks into the apartment and out of frame. CAMERA STAYS in the hallway. We can hear Tracy moving about O.S. Then, as if on its own, the door to the hall closet slowly swings open. .until we can see Duncan standing inside the closet.
DUNCAN: ( urgent whisper ) I just have to talk to you. ( pathetically ) I want you to be my friend.
DUNCAN: He takes his hand away from her mouth, lets go of her, and slowly, cautiously steps back. Tracy looks at him for a breathless moment, her eyes wild with fear. Then she screams. Duncan jumps back, stunned, frightened and confused. Tracy doesn't move. She just keeps screaming hysterically.
SEAMAN: So this will be your first time? An old salt like you?
SEAMAN: ( still laughing; slightly punchy ) You'll love it here. It's where they make the bombs. It's where they make the planes that carry the bombs; the planes we saw over Singapore and
SEAMAN: There she is. That's America.
DUNCAN'S POV: The coast of Southern California emerges through the mist. A foghorn blows somewhere in the distance.
CHEATER: Hail fellow well met, and all that jazz. It's our lucky day! A friend of your's got money for you. We got to get back to the park and meet him.
CHEATER: C'mon. He'll be comin' for you, Crazy Curt. S'got some money. We'll get us a little joy juice.
CHEATER: C'mon! Hey!! You really are crazy!
CHEATER: "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage! Blow, you cataracts and hurricanoes, spout till you have drench'd our steeples and drown'd the cocks!"
WIDER ANGLE: Clifford keeps coming, closer and closer to where Duncan lies. He is but six or seven bodies away when Duncan jumps up suddenly and bolts for the door. Clifford looks up, sees the fleeing figure and charges after INT. CORRIDORS Racing through a maze of narrow hallways, Duncan can't stop to think where he's going. Clifford is barreling after him some forty yards behind. Duncan rounds a corner and ten yards up ahead, the hallway deadends in a set of double doors. Duncan has no choice but to hurl himself against the doors. They yield and he goes through them. Four seconds later, Clifford comes to the same doors and pushes through to the other side.
CLIFFORD: Duncan. Duncan. It's over now. Come on out.
CLIFFORD: My name's John Clifford. I'm a private detective. I've been hired by Alexander Mandrakis to take you back. I'm not going to hurt you.
CLIFFORD: ( gently; coaxing ) I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not going to hurt you. There'll be no more pain. You're safe now.
DUNCAN: ( hysterical ) No! Mandrakis! No!

On the street a patrol car slowly passes and disappears down the INT. KITCHEN Jill enters, turns on the light, opens a cupboard and takes out a glass. She goes to the refrigerator and opens it. Suddenly, the lights go out. Jill closes the refrigerator door and goes and turns on another light. Apparently, only a lightbulb has blown. Jill unscrews the burned-out bulb from its socket and throws it in the trash. She leaves the kitchen.
