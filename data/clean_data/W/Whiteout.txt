END SCROLL: EXT. ANTARCTICA - DAY Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white wasteland. No buildings, no animals. nothing.
THUD!!!: A FACE, hooded and goggled in ECW ( extreme cold weather gear ) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops It's a man.
JAMIE: Sorry, a Professor Sapperstein needs to see you in biology. Said it's urgent.
CARRIE: Jamie leaves.
CARRIE: ( SARCASTIC ) Hey Fred, unlock any secrets of the Universe discover we're Alien life forms?
FRED: Workin' on it.
CARRIE: Which one's Sapperstein?
SCIENTIST: Deschampsia Antarctica.
CARRIE: Okay, thanks.
SAPPERSTEIN: Wanted to see me?
CARRIE: Wanted to see me?
SAPPERSTEIN: Follow me.
CARRIE: All what?
SAPPERSTEIN: Cannabis Sativa.
CARRIE: Professor Sapperstein, I'd like you to read something for me.
SAPPERSTEIN: Carrie Stetko.
CARRIE: Keep reading.
SAPPERSTEIN: United States Marshal.
CARRIE: Very good.
SAPPERSTEIN: Not this year, no.
CARRIE: Good. And how are you feeling right now?
SAPPERSTEIN: You think I'm crazy? Is that what you're saying?
CARRIE: ( PACIFYING ) No, no, not crazy. But this time of year, down here, we're all going a little toasty aren't we? How about you plant a little Cannabis when you get home?
CARRIE: What do you think?
MURPHY: I got a pilot at ASB who thinks he spotted a popsicle out on the ice.
CARRIE: What flavor?
MURPHY: Don't know.
CARRIE: And we were doing so well.
MURPHY: McClain Valley.
CARRIE: McClain Valley? What was he doing out there? That's no man's land.
MURPHY: I've got a plane heading to ASB in an hour with some supplies for Can't get you back until tomorrow.
CARRIE: No just the picture.
P: opulation: 183 Temperature: - 55Â°
CARRIE: Bottom of the frickin' planet.
CARRIE: Another door in the back of the room is open, but the light is off. Carrie turns to leave and
KELLER: Well, hello Marshal.
CARRIE: She leaves. He falls into stride with her.
KELLER: Out back. What are you doing Checking the freezer for a No shit?
CARRIE: Checking the freezer for a No shit?
KELLER: No shit?
CARRIE: It got called in this morning.
KELLER: Who spotted it?
CARRIE: Delfy, one of the pilots here.
KELLER: It's his first year down here. You know how that goes. My bet it was just debris, an old tent or Yeah probably.
CARRIE: Yeah probably.
KELLER: Here's an idea why don't you stay here with me and we'll party, just the two of us. Put those cuffs of yours to work.
CARRIE: .Were you the second guy from the front?
KELLER: Not interested.
CARRIE: Not interested.
RHONDA: I'll have them boomerang back and pick up the load just have it
TECH: Guys got the science lab all shut Good, have them check all the pressure levels on the hydraulics, then clear the exterior storage bins. Make sure we're not leaving anything out there.
RHONDA: Good, have them check all the pressure levels on the hydraulics, then clear the exterior storage bins. Make sure we're not leaving anything out there.
CARRIE: Fine. I need a plane and that pilot who saw the popsicle.
RHONDA: I'll have him meet you in the
CARRIE: Yeah, good.
DOC: In less than three days we begin Winter-over. The sky will go completely black and stay that way for six months.
ASIAN: T. T. Three minutes.
DOC: Your core body temperatures have fallen to approximately 97 degrees. You are shivering uncontrollably losing basic motor skills. You're having trouble focusing on even the simplest tasks. In short, you are well on your way to dying, and it has only been two-hundred seconds.
CLASS: Hello Marshal Stetko.
DOC: Always a pleasure to see you. Unlike most of the beaker-heads down here.
CARRIE: I wish We got a job. I need you to take a ride with me.
DOC: Why's this crap always happen at the end of the season?
CARRIE: So it is.
DOC: What's your gut say about this My gut and I don't talk anymore.
CARRIE: My gut and I don't talk anymore.
DOC: People change, Carrie.
CARRIE: Not you.
DOC: I got a card from my Granddaughter inviting me to her fifth birthday party. You know, I've never even met her.
CARRIE: Or mentioned her. A grandchild? Doc, that's great.
DOC: It got me thinking I need to be a better Grandfather, than I was a father. It's time I deal with my life. I've been down here a lot longer than I probably should
CARRIE: You Delfy?
DELFY: Yes, ma'am.
DOC: Where the hell they get these
DELFY: Brooklyn. And unless your wrinkled ass has a heart attack on my plane, I think we'll be all
DOC: I want Keller. He's my pilot.
CARRIE: Delfy's taking us, Doc. He's the one who saw the body. C'mon, you'll be fine. I'll even hold your hand if you want.
CARRIE: What were you doing out there?
DELFY: I went to evac a camp. Had to fly off route to get around a storm. Got down low to avoid some turbulence, and there it was.
CARRIE: That your son?
DELFY: Yeah, name's Nathan.
CARRIE: He's cute. Has your eyes.
DELFY: Lucky he got his momma's brain. Kid's smart.
CARRIE: So why aren't you with him?
DELFY: The bonus pay. Trying to buy a house. Give my boy a yard. His own room. Stuff I never had.
CARRIE: Hate it.
DELFY: Then why are you down here?
CARRIE: We all make stupid mistakes.
DELFY: It's right up here.
CARRIE: Yeah. Got it. It's a popsicle
DOC: . It's always different when they freeze. Some curl up. Some stretch out. Some tear their clothes off. They get delirious. What was that guy's name?
CARRIE: Yeah. He's lost in a storm. We can't find him, but we hear him on the radio going on and on about the Serengeti heat and his wife, Janet. Next day, we find him frozen solid, wearing nothing but his bunny boots.
DOC: Yeah. He's lost in a storm. We can't find him, but we hear him on the radio going on and on about the Serengeti heat and his wife, Janet. Next day, we find him frozen solid, wearing nothing but his bunny boots.
DELFY: The CORPSE is just ahead a frozen display of death.
DOC: Never seen a dead guy?
CARRIE: So do you. Think his name's Weiss. We Wintered-over last year with him. Played cards a couple of times.
DOC: The guy who cheated?
CARRIE: Yeah. Geologist, I think.
DOC: Carrie pulls out a DIGITAL CAMERA from a pocket. Shoots a couple of pics.
CARRIE: Then where's his crampons his
DOC: Maybe down the crevasse?
CARRIE: Yeah, maybe
DELFY: Brits about eighty miles west.
CARRIE: ( looking at body - Soto ) What the hell where you doing all the way out here?
DOC: Ah Christ he's a sticker.
LATER: A pile of chopped ice is off to the side of corpse. Delfy, who looks very uneasy about all this, grabs the feet as Carrie and Doc each grab an arm.
CARRIE: You going to be alright?
DELFY: No this is the kind of stuff that scars you for life.
DOC: Gonna give myself a Goddamn
CARRIE: Oh yeah I'm really going to miss this place.
CARRIE: Who manages the Post Stations?
RHONDA: Dinkle. Howard Dinkle.
DOC: Carrie, let's just bag him and put him on a plane to McMurdo.
CARRIE: It bothers me no one's reported him missing yet.
DOC: Because maybe no one thinks he is.
CARRIE: How'd he get out there? There were no tracks.
DOC: Sounds to me like you and your gut are talking again.
CARRIE: Nobody wants to get out of here more than I do, trust me, but right now we're all this guy
CARRIE: Grab that side.
DOC: Stirring up a few things?
CARRIE: .I'll be alright.
DOC: You know, this means a Federal Investigation, and we're witnesses. We may get stuck here.
CARRIE: I know.
DOC: We both want to do the right thing Carrie but we also need to get off the ice. Right now we don't have to say a word. When they find something later hey, we didn't know. We were leaving, the body was frozen, we didn't have time to examine it. No one gets murdered in Antarctica. Think about it. Dead is dead.
CARRIE: Exactly, this is the first murder in Antarctica, Doc and I can't just pretend it didn't happen.
DOC: Why did I know you were going to say that?
CARRIE: I'm on my way to find out.
CARRIE: I'm sure his family's thinking the same thing.
CARRIE: I hate interrupting educational programming, but
LAST GUY: Carrie flips a nearby wall switch. Lights kick on. Small room. English flag. There's a Beckham poster and an 8x10 framed photo, turned backwards, hanging on one wall. A large map of Antarctica on another.
CARRIE: Carrie flips a nearby wall switch. Lights kick on. Small room. English flag. There's a Beckham poster and an 8x10 framed photo, turned backwards, hanging on one wall. A large map of Antarctica on another.
DINKLE: Am I in some kind of trouble?
CARRIE: What are they doing out there?
DINKLE: Collecting meteorites.
CARRIE: English, please.
DINKLE: Means it's a good place to look for meteorites.
CARRIE: I don't get it Weiss was no where near Delta One One.
DINKLE: One sec
CARRIE: Isn't that a little unusual this close to Winter-over?
DINKLE: Yes, it is. Really unusual, I guess I should've contacted them, but
CARRIE: You've been a little busy. Yeah, I can see that.
DINKLE: Carrie spins a dial to 17. Keys the microphone, drawing it to her face.
CARRIE: ( into microphone ) Delta One One, this is United States Marshall Carrie Stetko, come back, over.
CARRIE: ( BEAT ) Patch it through.
CARRIE: This is Marshal Stetko, who's John Mooney.
CARRIE: MOONEY ( V.O. )
CARRIE: What happened out there, Mooney?
CARRIE: Where's Rubin?
CARRIE: Getting drunk already?
DOC: Just gearing my liver up in case I have to stay the next six months.
CARRIE: Murphy's contacting the Feds.
DOC: You're making my day.
CARRIE: I'll do everything I can to get you off this ice, promise.
DOC: I know you will.
CARRIE: Going to Vostok.
DOC: What's he doing in Russia?
RHONDA: We're tracking it now.
CARRIE: I need a plane to Vostok.
RHONDA: ( into phone ) I don't control the weather you want to stay the winter, then don't be ready for your evac.
CARRIE: I'm not asking.
RHONDA: What am I supposed to tell the deep drill ice core team getting picked up in four and a half?
CARRIE: Tell them I took their plane.
DELFY: ( WHISPER ) What's with this place?
CARRIE: The Russians barely supply Vostok anymore. They have to barter with other bases for supplies. Some of these guys have been rotting here for years.
CARRIE: Who's in charge?
YURI: ( heavy accent ) Who's asking?
CARRIE: Stetko, US Marshal. I'm here to talk to an American named Mooney.
YURI: So many people come through Vostok. Is hard to remember.
CARRIE: I figured.
YURI: Mister Mooney, yes. I remember now. He offers pay us to fly him off Antarctica on our transport. We give him very good price - because plane leaves a week ago!
CARRIE: Where is he?
YURI: Red storm line.
DELFY: You don't carry a gun?
CARRIE: Against the law Antarctica's the only place in the world you can't have one. Part of the Doesn't that make you feel kind of All this crap on I prefer
DELFY: Doesn't that make you feel kind of All this crap on I prefer
CARRIE: All this crap on I prefer
DELFY: Gettin' worse. Minus eighty-one. Wind at a hundred and ten knots.
CARRIE: Do you have to do that in front of
DELFY: Give you a hand?
CARRIE: Sets down his coffee on a nearby shelf. As he fastens it, Carrie pulls on her goggles and a face mask. They finish at the same time.
DELFY: Ever been on a rope-line in a Nope. Thoughts?
CARRIE: Nope. Thoughts?
DELFY: Yeah, hold on tight.
CARRIE: ( calling out ) Mooney? Hello?
CARRIE: .My God.
CARRIE: No answer.
CARRIE: What happened?
DELFY: When you didn't come back we went looking for you. Found a dead guy in the other building that Mooney?
CARRIE: Yeah. Someone got to him before I did. Then went after me.
DELFY: A couple hours.
CARRIE: As she starts to sit up, he protests, saying something in Russian. She ignores him. He walks away, mumbling something else.
DELFY: Whoever it was, could have flown out after the storm broke.
CARRIE: Let it go, Delfy.
DELFY: Until I met you, I hadn't seen any dead people. Now I'm at two.
CARRIE: Unless you want your head cracked, I wouldn't move.
MAN: Take it easy.
CARRIE: Let me see your hands.
MAN: Robert Pryce. I'm a United Nations observer for the Oceanic and Antarctic section. If you relax, I've got my ID.
CARRIE: Let's see it slowly.
PRYCE: You must be Stetko
CARRIE: How do you know about Weiss?
PRYCE: FBI notified us. Your base commander called it in.
CARRIE: This is part of a crime scene.
PRYCE: I realize that, but considering the time constraints we're up against, let's be honest, taping and bagging everything isn't going to be an option.
CARRIE: I'll be sure to let the U.N. know if I find out anything.
PRYCE: You heading out to Delta One One?
CARRIE: I'll grab my bag.
PRYCE: I'll grab my bag.
CARRIE: Don't take this personally, but I don't need your help.
PRYCE: If they've been digging out there, that's a direct violation of the United Nations treaty. We think they were digging. That makes it my business.
CARRIE: You don't dig for meteorites.
PRYCE: And you don't get killed for them either. This is now a U.N. matter. I am within my rights to commandeer your pilot and plane if I have to.
DELFY: He can, you know.
CARRIE: Fine. But this is my investigation, understand? If you obstruct it in any way, I will have you detained.
PRYCE: ( BEAT ) Mind if I ask you a personal No, but I have the feeling you're going to anyway.
CARRIE: No, but I have the feeling you're going to anyway.
PRYCE: Why do you smell like suntan
CARRIE: Murphy, listen to me, it's got to be Rubin who tried to kill me. You have to shut down flights leaving ASB and McMurdo search for him.
CARRIE: Sam, I think these guys found something out there at the camp. I'm going to check it out. Until I find Rubin, no one leaves the ice. Not yet.
PRYCE: We ready?
CARRIE: Guess so.
CARRIE: What time is it?
PRYCE: Two thirty.
CARRIE: A.M. or P.M.?
PRYCE: ( re: tent ) I'll take this one.
CARRIE: ( re: tent ) I'll take this one.
CARRIE: She steps into the tent. Moves to the cot. There's a pool of blood underneath. Her heart pounds. She uses her flashlight, touches the sleeping bag. It doesn't move. She pulls at it.
PRYCE: Someone's left leg took a hit, lost a lot of blood. What do you Their daily work log.
CARRIE: Someone's left leg took a hit, lost a lot of blood. What do you Their daily work log.
PRYCE: Their daily work log.
DELFY: Looks like my dad's old lawn It's ground penetrating radar.
PRYCE: It's ground penetrating radar.
CARRIE: Looks like they were surveying sections at a time.
PRYCE: Areas labeled?
CARRIE: He's flipping back and forth through the pages
PRYCE: At Sections 101 and 102, they spent one day.
CARRIE: Looks like they hit some really big meteors.
PRYCE: How far?
CARRIE: About four miles.
PRYCE: Let's go see what they found.
CARRIE: I want to check something out
DELFY: I said "which way?"
CARRIE: Pryce sees Carrie pause for a moment, massaging her gloved left hand.
PRYCE: Yeah, a little.
CARRIE: Yeah, a little.
PRYCE: How long have you been down here, Almost two years.
CARRIE: Almost two years.
PRYCE: What brought you to the ice?
CARRIE: ( SARCASTIC ) The excitement, mostly.
PRYCE: Everyone down here is running away from something.
CARRIE: Some shrink tell you that?
PRYCE: Yeah, and that I should call my mother more often
CARRIE: And do you?
PRYCE: Every Sunday.
CARRIE: Where do you plant your boots?
PRYCE: They got me working out of Christchurch, New Zealand. Beautiful country. But this crazy place to make a living.
CARRIE: I came down to fill in for a Marshal for six weeks before Winter-over. I met someone, decided to stay.
PRYCE: He give you that ring I saw? Tell you he was going to marry you?
CARRIE: No just gave me a headache.
PRYCE: Flattered that you even looked.
CARRIE: This is it.
DELFY: There's nothing here.
CARRIE: Just stop.
PRYCE: You sure this is right?
CARRIE: Section 104. These are the Maybe you wrote them down wrong.
DELFY: Maybe you wrote them down wrong.
CARRIE: This is shaved ice.
PRYCE: ( to Delfy ) Hold my legs!
CARRIE: I'm slipping!
PRYCE: Almost got you.
CARRIE: I'm losing my grip.
PRYCE: Carrie? Can you hear me?
DELFY: ( YELLING ) .I'm okay.
DELFY: Saw a rope in the Cat.
CARRIE: Cargo plane, but I don't recognize It's an Antanov-74. Russian made - - late fifties. No one's put these in the air for forty years.
DELFY: It's an Antanov-74. Russian made - - late fifties. No one's put these in the air for forty years.
CARRIE: Guess that makes three.
DELFY: This isn't funny
CARRIE: Where's Pryce?
CARRIE: What is that?
DELFY: Carrie continues through the hold. Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM flickers over more chaos of the crash. HUGE STEEL TANKS
CARRIE: ( SUSPICIOUS ) Find what you're looking for?
PRYCE: Just answers.
CARRIE: And by the looks of that safe, must've been transporting something pretty important.
PRYCE: They put some serious work into
CARRIE: Whoever got hurt, they dragged him out of here. There's blood all over the tunnel.
DELFY: It's the Cat!
CARRIE: CRASHCRASHCRASH! More ICE.
DELFY: The continual sound of falling ice grows MUFFLED and
CARRIE: No signal, you?
PRYCE: This isn't going to work, it's like digging through concrete with a spoon.
CARRIE: How long do you figure we've got?
PRYCE: Three of us down here 12, 15 hours at the most.
DELFY: No way. I'm not going out like this. No way.
CARRIE: What about the Vodka we could make some torches, maybe melt the Fire will burn the O2 quicker.
PRYCE: Fire will burn the O2 quicker.
CARRIE: What choice do we have?
DELFY: Don't need my vote.
PRYCE: Hold these.
CARRIE: What're you doing?
PRYCE: All these planes used to have bail- out hatches.
CARRIE: We came in through it.
DELFY: It'd be on the ceiling in case of an ocean landing.
PRYCE: Found it!
CARRIE: Or, if the ice is too thick the blast will come right back at us.
PRYCE: We can be blown up, suffocate or freeze to death. Take your pick.
DELFY: Pryce drops down. Moves to another crate.
PRYCE: Delfy, help me with this. We'll need to get up higher.
CARRIE: Don't move.
PRYCE: What's going on?
DELFY: Yeah what're you doing?
CARRIE: Our friend here isn't who he says he is.
PRYCE: I've been authorized because of what's happened.
CARRIE: Stop lying to me
PRYCE: Don't do this.
DELFY: Man, the guy just saved our He was saving his own. Do it.
CARRIE: He was saving his own. Do it.
PRYCE: Have you got an ID for that too?
CARRIE: Have you got an ID for that too?
PRYCE: Listen to me Forty eight hours ago, we picked up chatter between someone down here and Tahir Soufian, a black market trader in New York. It was all about setting up a buy for cannisters found in an old Russian transport buried in the ice.
DELFY: Damn, I knew that government eavesdropping was true.
PRYCE: There's been rumors for years that the Russians had a second base a secret weapons research facility under the ice that supposedly blew up in the late sixties nothing was ever confirmed.
CARRIE: Why did you lie to me?
PRYCE: Look, the U.N. carries a lot of weight down here. Think about it - - if I had told you I was C.I.A., you would have been on the horn back to Washington in no time. This is a very sensitive matter. News travels fast down here, I don't have to tell you that.
DELFY: Keys are still in it!
CARRIE: Plane could've gone anywhere. There's forty-six countries here all counting down to Winter-over. Rubin could just disappear in the
CARRIE: Heading back. How many fly-ins to McMurdo in the last four hours?
CARRIE: ( SNAPS ) How many?
CARRIE: I need a list of names.
DELFY: You think Rubin might try to leave out of McMurdo?
CARRIE: He knows I'm on his ass, so he might. Anything's possible. I want to eliminate his options.
CARRIE: Back at ASB
PRYCE: ( to Delfy ) How long to get there?
DELFY: When we get back to the plane, I'll get ya there in forty
PRYCE: ( into phone ) I'll scan a picture of him and get it to you. Meanwhile, contact every non-American base down here and put them on watch. He's got some plan to get these off the
CARRIE: I know why Weiss was so far from Delta One One.
PRYCE: You need to get that looked at.
CARRIE: I'll have the Doc take a peek when we're done.
DINKLE: Murphy's looking for you.
CARRIE: Murphy? What the hell is he doing
HERE: Came in on the evac.
DINKLE: Came in on the evac.
CARRIE: I'm on 30 if you need me. Rubin's picture is in a file on my desk.
DINKLE: Make sure I get that back.
PRYCE: Of course.
TECH: It's packing winds of a hundred thirty knots.
MURPHY: Shit we've got to move up the How much?
RHONDA: How much?
MURPHY: Six hours at least.
RHONDA: Jesus, I got crew that's still not Then get them in!
MURPHY: Then get them in!
MURPHY: Where the hell have you been?
CARRIE: Buried under 2 tons of ice. You?
MURPHY: Do me a favor, you find any more bodies, mind not parading them down the main corridor. I've got Newbies afraid to winterover, for Chirstsake. They want out on seats I don't have. And next time you want to take a Goddamn plane anywhere, you ask me.
CARRIE: Sure thing, Chief.
MURPHY: We don't have enough supplies for all of us to Winter-over if we get stuck down here.
CARRIE: It didn't work, Sam, because you couldn't keep your hands off every new woman who stepped foot on the ice down here. I was stupid enough to be one of them. Now if you could cut through your red tape for just one second, you would realize that someone's out there with six cannisters, possibly full of Uranium, and he wants to get it into the hands of some very bad people. And I'm trying to stop it so fuck asking you for shit, Sam.
MURPHY: This is ridic-
CARRIE: You know what Doc, it's alright.
DOC: I'm worried about you. Is it going to take another attempt on your life to get you to finally slow down?
CARRIE: You worry too much but it's what I like about you.
DOC: I striped him down to put him in a bodybag. There's only the puncture from the axe. No way, I would have noticed it. Why?
CARRIE: Then it's gotta be Rubin.
DOC: Any word from the FBI?
CARRIE: There's no way they're gonna make it. Not with that storm coming in over the peninsula.
DOC: Jesus, Carrie, how long did you let this go?
CARRIE: When did I go to Vostok?
DOC: Feel that?
CARRIE: Doc tries the needle in another location.
DOC: ( CONTINUED )
CARRIE: ( STUNNED ) No way. Don't tell me that.
DOC: The fingers are dead, Carrie. If I don't do it now, gangrene will set in. You'll lose your hand.
PRYCE: I stopped by the clinic. Doc told me.
CARRIE: Pretty tough Marshal, huh?
FINGER ): If you came to propose, now's not really a good time.
PRYCE: Got Rubin's face all over Antarctica, but nobody's seen him
CARRIE: .You ever kill anyone?
PRYCE: Anyone you ever trusted?
CARRIE: Anyone you ever trusted?
PRYCE: I hadn't held a gun in my hand for over two years.
CARRIE: I hadn't held a gun in my hand for over two years.
PRYCE: What happened?
CARRIE: We were on a stakeout at a Holiday Inn in Miami, waiting for this buy to go down. I was excited, we'd been after this trafficker for a long time. Thought this bust would be my big chance to impress the brass. Anyway, guy's a no show. One hour went by, then two - - nothing.
PRYCE: It's what the Russians used to transport weapons grade materials in. They match the dimensions inside the safe. We're looking for six of these.
CARRIE: These beakers where really in over their heads.
PRYCE: I better get this back to him. And we have to find Rubin.
CARRIE: Think you can you help me with these buttons, first?
PRYCE: He moves closer. Starts to button her up.
MAN: ( raspy, deep ) .You Stetko?
CARRIE: Who are you?
RUBIN: Did Mooney talk to you? I didn't hear from him he was supposed to call me after you
CARRIE: Mooney's dead.
RUBIN: And so's Weiss.
CARRIE: And so's Weiss.
RUBIN: And I'm next, I know it.
CARRIE: It's okay, you're safe, just put the knife down.
RUBIN: Weiss didn't want to go through with it. Oh God. How did we let this happen?
CARRIE: Rubin I need you to focus for
CARRIE: It's okay, he's a doctor, he can help you.
CARRIE: Rubin's here! He's on the run. Level one. White T-shirt. Jeans.
CARRIE: Rubin, wait!
CARRIE: Rubin I can help you!
CARRIE: Door's jammed
CARRIE: Shit, Rubin doesn't have any gear
PRYCE: How long's he been out there?
CARRIE: Thirty seconds.
RUBIN: .Help me.
RUBIN: He turns around to check on his pursuer. Twenty feet away and closing.
RHONDA: She looks to Murphy, who is on the phone.
KELLER: I sh. sh. shoulda killed you at Vostok.
CARRIE: Where are the cannisters?
KELLER: Go to hell.
PRYCE: Wrong answer.
CARRIE: Help me drag him over here.
PRYCE: Who's Tahir selling it to what's the intended target?
KELLER: What're you doing, you crazy
CARRIE: Why did you kill those scientists, Keller? Was a four-way split too much for you?
KELLER: Fuck you.
CARRIE: Where is the uranium?
KELLER: ( almost smug ) You have no idea what's going on here, do you?
PRYCE: Hit the sonofabitch again!
KELLER: The plane, they're in the fucking
MURPHY: Have you completely lost your Let go of me.
CARRIE: Let go of me.
KELLER: Find them yourself.
MURPHY: What the hell's going on?
CARRIE: The cannisters are on the plane.
MURPHY: Who the hell are you?
PRYCE: Name's Pryce.
CARRIE: He's with the UN. We have to search that plane now!
MURPHY: We don't have time. We'll just search it in Christchurch when it
PRYCE: It's a twelve hour flight to Christchurch. Anything can happen in that time. Keller is here, so we know it's still on the ground.
CARRIE: Sam, do what is right here. Come Do what you have to, but that plane takes off in one hour.
MURPHY: Do what you have to, but that plane takes off in one hour.
CARRIE: We'll need some help.
MURPHY: I'll send what I can.
PRYCE: It's clean.
CARRIE: Nothing. That bastard. What the hell are you up to, I don't get it, why lie to us we have him either way. He's stuck here.
PRYCE: I don't get it, why lie to us we have him either way. He's stuck here.
CARRIE: He's buying time.
CARRIE: Out of the way!
CARRIE: He's got nowhere to go, nowhere to
PRYCE: He's got nowhere to go, nowhere to
CARRIE: He won't try. He's a goddamn
PRYCE: .I didn't see him.
CARRIE: No! You stay awake!
CARRIE: Press here. Hard. Hard or he will die!
