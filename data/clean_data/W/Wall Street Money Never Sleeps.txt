A little nervous, he sucks in a deep breath then heads into the building.
JACOB: I'm here to see Bretton Woods. The butler nods then leads Jacob through the full floor unit and into the.
PARLOR: A huge chandelier hangs over the all marble room. A fireplace on one wall and a twelve foot wall of glass featuring that park view on the other. And Jacob realizes that sonata is live. He's walked into a recital of some sort. About twenty people sit watching a YOUNG GIRL play on a very unique looking silver grand piano. The girl can't be a day over thirteen. She's playing Mozart's "Ronda Alla Turca". her fingers gliding across the keyboard in precision, her eyes closed in inspiration. It's as spectacular as it is moving. Jacob takes it in for a moment then looks over the room. All ethnicities and types. The AFRICAN LEADER in full tribal gear, the DISHEVELED ARTIST with his GAY NOVELIST LOVER, the NEW YORK KNICK with his MODEL WIFE, the MOVIE STAR with her TEENAGE SON. And BRETTON WOODS. Mid 40s, slicing jawline, deep set eyes, in great shape, refined, composed and masculine. He's the owner of this penthouse and he's looking right at Jacob. Jacob looks away. And the young girl finishes the last movement of the sonata to applause. The guests all stand, some go talk with the girl. Bretton heads over to Jacob.
BRETTON WOODS: As you can see, I'm having a little dinner party here but I thought it was important we speak right away. He speaks with a British accent.. Jacob nods. Bretton looks over the room for a moment, scans his guests then back at Jacob.
JACOB: Do you collect?
BRETTON WOODS: Sitting behind his desk.
JACOB: Your daughter's an amazing piano player. That was quite a show.
BRETTON WOODS: That wasn't my daughter. That was Isabel Patrovsky, she's the world's greatest living piano prodigy.
JACOB: BRETTON WOODS
BRETTON WOODS: Who told you?
JACOB: A doctor I know. Bretton nods. regards him.
BRETTON WOODS: I checked with all the desks in town. you didn't make money off it.
JACOB: That's right.
BRETTON WOODS: Then why did you do it?
JACOB: You destroyed my firm.
BRETTON WOODS: Your firm destroyed itself.
JACOB: You killed Andrew Zabel.
BRETTON WOODS: Andrew Zabel killed himself. And Bretton sighs.
JACOB: You made them true.
BRETTON WOODS: No, Jacob, being levered thirty-eight to one in toxic debt made them true.
JACOB: BRETTON WOODS
BRETTON WOODS: I run three billion dollars. Come help me run it. And Jacob takes a beat. processing this.
JACOB: Why me?
BRETTON WOODS: Because your loyalty desired revenge, your balls actually attempted it and your skills pulled it off. As he stands.
JACOB: You can have my answer now, Bretton. I have no interest in working for a fund that's in trouble. Bretton smiles.
BRETTON WOODS: Jacob nods. holding Bretton's look. Then.
JACOB: What's your number?
BRETTON WOODS: Excuse me?

JACOB: I know you're going to tell me. Diego smiles.
DIEGO: "This market's just like a divorce. I've lost half my money. only I still have my wife!" As he goes into the hot summer day.
JACOB: Not bad.
GORDON GEKKO: There's a wait.
JACOB: GORDON GEKKO
GORDON GEKKO: Fifteen minutes she said.
JACOB: GORDON GEKKO
GORDON GEKKO: No, that's not okay. Because it means they're crowded so every tier in the service chain will be extended. The sixteen minutes we would normally wait to order will now be twenty six, the standard twenty four minutes waiting for our food to arrive will turn into thirty nine, the eight minutes to get the check will become seventeen and the four minutes to process the credit card will take nine.
GORDON GEKKO: Did you eat before?
JACOB: Just not hungry.
GORDON GEKKO: Yeah. I used to not eat lunch too. Jacob nods and slides something across the table. The picture of Winnie in workout gear, flipping the finger. Gordon looks at it and laughs.
JACOB: I actually owe you one now. Off Gordon's look.
GORDON GEKKO: Did you?
JACOB: His fund is bleeding. I wouldn't be surprised if the redemptions finish the job.
GORDON GEKKO: Well, Chief. you seem awfully proud of yourself.
JACOB: How'd you know about Amlyn? Gordon shrugs.
GORDON GEKKO: It's amazing what information you can find out when people know you're not going to trade on it.
JACOB: So, you didn't use me to make a little And never to look up from his lunch.
GORDON GEKKO: Naw. I prefer to write about the action now than be apart of it.
JACOB: Why'd you give it to me?
GORDON GEKKO: You're out of a job and most likely going to marry my daughter. I figured you could use the money.
JACOB: I didn't make any money off of it.
GORDON GEKKO: You didn't trade it? With a smile in and over-the-top faux innocence.
JACOB: That would've been insider trading, Mr. Gekko. Gordon just shakes his head.
GORDON GEKKO: So did you take my advice and not tell your new fiance about our little Jacob doesn't say anything. And Gordon doesn't press.
JACOB: Good guess.
GORDON GEKKO: That's my Winnie. I knew she was a feminist when she was five and furious that Mrs. Claus didn't get enough And this makes Jacob smile. then.
SLICK: Gekko nods. Slick hits his floor. "PH."
GORDON GEKKO: You know it.
SLICK: ( inside of a derisive sigh ) Sells books I guess.
GORDON GEKKO: She refused to take that cowboy hat off. She actually slept in it. Smitten, Jacob looks at some more of the pictures then stands. taking in the large framed pictures on the wall. As Jacob checks out a framed chart for "Gouda Tulip Bulbs Dec 1 1634 to Feb 5 1637." The chart goes straight up and to the right then straight down in a single line.
JACOB: Bretton offered to hire me.
GORDON GEKKO: And did you accept? As Jacob moves over to an another piece.
JACOB: Fuck no. Jacob now finds himself looking at a political cartoon from the early 1900s. It's of two men rowing a boat in a lake of dollars. One of the men is Uncle Sam dressed in US flag colors. But Sam's very small in this cartoon. can't really row the boat. The other man is much bigger and clearly doing the heavy rowing. He is.
GORDON GEKKO: JP Morgan. he single-handedly stopped the Panic of 1907 by stepping in and buying up shares in all the companies that were crashing. Everyone else quickly followed like ( re political cartoon ) See people had stopped looking to their government or trusted advisors. They looked to JP Morgan. It was all about simple psychology every crash should have a JP Morgan to step in and save it. As they walk the hardwood floor.
JACOB: That's horrifying.
GORDON GEKKO: I know. As they both hold on the picture.
JACOB: What caused it?
GORDON GEKKO: A country in debt. that took on even more debt to fund a war. then printed mountains of money to avoid a depression and other financial As he turns to face Jacob.
JACOB: And you honestly think this is where we're heading? Looking Jacob head on. deadly serious.
GORDON GEKKO: If we don't take our heads out of the sand. yes. It's going to get bad out there, Champ, I'm not going to lie. Even the small regional bank I started out at might go under.
JACOB: Hudson River Bank.
GORDON GEKKO: That's right. And then.
JACOB: What are you talking about?
GORDON GEKKO: What I'm talking about, Jake. is that I'd bet dollars to donuts that Bretton Woods unwound most of his position in Amlyn last week. That he knew about the pancreatitis. Off of Jacob's confusion.
JACOB: How do you know that?
GORDON GEKKO: I don't. But it's not Bretton's first rodeo. and my instincts for this sort of thing don't often disappoint. Jacob can't believe it. And with each passing moment of realization. shock turns into rage.
JACOB: I can't believe it.
GORDON GEKKO: Believe it, Princess. he's beating your ass all over the court. As Jacob tries to calm himself.
JACOB: And you think I should take the job bring him down from the inside? Gordon confirms that with a simple shake of the head and.

As they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only narrow trail entering it, Jacob focuses on the horizon and revs the bike into more speed. He pulls up next to Bretton as they approach the trail. If Jacob doesn't slow down, and fall in line behind Bretton, he's going to hit the trees. But he doesn't. Instead, Jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed, narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail. pulling ahead of Bretton and taking the lead.

BRETTON WOODS: ( not going to work ) Oil's crashing. Jacob thinks for a moment, then.
JACOB: And how much do we need?
BRETTON WOODS: Fifty, sixty million minimum. and that's just to hold off the current margin calls. And Bretton just sighs.
JACOB: Sit tight. I'm going to get us the And Jacob goes. Bretton calling out after him.
BRETTON WOODS: From who. ?
LADY: I have a question. what exactly is "moral hazard?" With a smile.
GORDON GEKKO: Short version taking risks you're not accountable for with other people's money. And the next person steps up and hands Gordon a copy.
JACOB: He's going for it. We're almost home. As he signs it.
GORDON GEKKO: There you go.
JACOB: But he needs fresh money to serve the leverage. A hundred million. Gordon just shrugs.
GORDON GEKKO: I'm a writer now. We don't make that As the line of people holding their new books start to get I know that, but I figured you might know how to get it. Handing Jacob back the signed copy.
JACOB: I know that, but I figured you might know how to get it. Handing Jacob back the signed copy.
GORDON GEKKO: Well, if you need money that badly, Jake. you might want to check closer to home. Off Jacob's confused reaction.
WINNIE: It's a lot.
JACOB: How much?
WINNIE: I don't know, Jacob. I never really considered it mine.
JACOB: But it is. right? It's your money? And she faces him. regarding his urgency.
WINNIE: ( glaring at him ) You might want to wipe some of the drool off your face.
JACOB: I'm not kidding. This is important. As they continue to walk.
WINNIE: Yes, it's mine. When he went to prison, my father put a lot of money in our names. And when Rudy died it all became mine.
JACOB: Let's say I can figure out a way for you to get it. Take a loan against it something like that. Will you do that for me?
WINNIE: Why are you doing this, Jacob? Jacob takes a moment. looking away with.
JACOB: This is my only chance to make things right, Winnie. And she just regards him. not sure.
HADLEY: Gordon couldn't invest any of his money so he put most of it into the children's names with directions on how it was to be invested.
JACOB: And how could Winnie get it now? Hadley stops walking and thinks about it.
HADLEY: Well, she'd have to sign a reversion of trust document. That way the funds would revert back to their pre-trust posture and regulations.
JACOB: So all she has to do is sign a piece of paper?
HADLEY: As that registers.
JACOB: How much is in there?
HADLEY: It's complicated. There's private equity ownership, real estate, a very large position in a bank. all sorts of investment vehicles.
JACOB: Ballpark it for me.
HADLEY: I don't know. Assuming immediate liquidity. over three hundred And with that, Jacob sets to go. But.
GORDON GEKKO: You also would need the trust's executor to sign it.
JACOB: Who is that?
GORDON GEKKO: Sammy Redding. He's a lifelong friend. It won't be a problem.
JACOB: What about you?
GORDON GEKKO: I would love to sign it, Jacob. Consider it done. Walking down 5th avenue.
JACOB: Thank you. Thank you, Gordon.
GORDON GEKKO: Just after you agree to two things.
JACOB: GORDON GEKKO
GORDON GEKKO: Before Bretton buys the bank, he must use all of Winnie's money and all the Locust Fund's leverage to go against the market. They're about to pass this bailout and I want to be on the other side of it.
JACOB: But what about
GORDON GEKKO: It's just for a few weeks then it's right back to our plan.
JACOB: ( AND THEN )
WINNIE GEKKO: As she starts to sign the forms. we're in.
GORDON GEKKO: Winnie. come here. you're all I have left now. And she slowly walks over to him. to his embrace.
WINNIE: You always get what you want, Dad. And Jacob Moore. witnessing this strange reunion. realizing how right she is.
JACOB: ( into his phone ) Okay, it looks like this bailout's going to pass.
JACOB: What? No market joke today? Diego just shrugs.
DIEGO: It stopped being funny. Jacob softly nods and heads on his way.
JACOB: I thought you were in London. Jacob nods.
BRETTON WOODS: The United Bancorp deal is going to go through. I've begun unwinding all our But our deal with Gordon was that we have to stay short until November 5th. Bretton just looks at him.
JACOB: But our deal with Gordon was that we have to stay short until November 5th. Bretton just looks at him.
BRETTON WOODS: Jacob, Gordon redeemed all his money yesterday. We're clean with him. And this hits Jacob like a ton of bricks.
JACOB: No. No, everything's great. Forcing out a smile.
JACOB: Thank you, he hasn't answered his phone and we're very worried. The landlord nods and unlocks the apartment door for them.
JACOB: He played me. She joins his side.
WINNIE: I don't give a shit about the money. And she turns to face him.
JACOB: I lied to you. I contacted him. I spent time with him. Without you I knew.
WINNIE: I knew.
JACOB: You knew?
WINNIE: I saw the picture in your wallet.
JACOB: Then why didn't you say anything?
WINNIE: Because I wanted to give you a chance to say something first.
DISAPPOINTMENT ): But Jacob. you've become that exact thing I've been trying to master. . and places it into his palm.
HADLEY: It's completely legal, Jacob. The funds reverted back to the pre-trust posture. that means the money was technically Gordon's again. Hadley just shrugs.
JACOB: But he's not allowed to trade.
HADLEY: He didn't trade.
JACOB: He put the money into the hedge fund, that's considered capital investment.
HADLEY: Jacob, Gordon never put the money into a hedge fund. He simply took control of the bank.
JACOB: Bank? What bank?
HADLEY: Hudson River. I told you about the position in the bank. Jacob's stunned.
JACOB: Hudson River. ? I don't understand.
JACOB: But how? Gordon wasn't allowed to control the trust.
HADLEY: That's right. All of the trust's moves were made by its executor.
JACOB: Sammy Redding? Sammy Redding? Who the hell is Sammy Jacob, the executor of Winnie's trust has always been Bretton Woods. And as that slams into Jacob Moore.
HADLEY: Sammy Redding? Who the hell is Sammy Jacob, the executor of Winnie's trust has always been Bretton Woods. And as that slams into Jacob Moore.
JACOB: So we're throwing Bretton's birthday party at Balmoral.
MANAGER: Well, we're very proud to have such a resounding success hail from these hallowed halls I assure you.
JACOB: That's funny because he often speaks about his days here at Redmayne and Bentley. anyway, what I'm hoping you can help me with were records of his early trades. Years ago.
MANAGER: Of course. but it is against policy to allow just anyone to see those I completely understand. How about this? I'll make you a trade.
JACOB: I completely understand. How about this? I'll make you a trade.
JACOB: Wow, Bretton you really kicked some ass for client forty one. Finally Jacob turns to the back of the ledger, to the client key, where he moves the pencil down to client #41 and it says. Gordon Gekko.
OLEG: It's been a bitch of a month, my friend. tell me this visit does not bring bad news.
OLEG: You want me to audit The Locust Fund?
JACOB: That's right. I want you to tell Bretton you need the official records of all the fund's activity starting with when you gave him the original two hundred million. You need this because The Russian Federal Tax Service is up your ass and you have to play ball with them.
OLEG: And if he declines. ?
JACOB: You'll have no choice but to pull your Oleg lights a cigarette. exhaling the smoke with.
OLEG: And why would I do that? And Jacob leans forward.
JACOB: Because if you do this for me, Oleg, I'll teach you the Andrew Zabel magic. I'll explain to you, in detail, all of his techniques. I'll give you all his secrets. it's less complicated than you might think.
JACOB: Hello. Okay, thank you. He moves to the curtains then opens them. And the daylight spills in.
OLEG: All the Locust Fund's trades for the last two years. Jacob nods, placing them into his bag. And Oleg lights a cigarette. looks right at us. excited. leaning forward with.
JACOB: They were working together. Your father and Bretton. Walking back into the apartment.
WINNIE: Jacob, what are you doing here? Following her in.
JACOB: Gordon wanted the trust the whole time. And when I came to him seeking revenge. he saw his window. Upset, she looks for her keys.
WINNIE: I have to go to work.
JACOB: Bretton owed him a favor because he fed your father information twenty three years ago when he was a young broker in London and your father never ratted him out. She just looks at him. shaking her head. and not in disapproval. but in pity. But he keeps going.
WINNIE: That's the bank he worked at when I was born.
JACOB: Well, now he owns it. Or shall I say pilfered it before he went AWOL.
WINNIE: And Jacob confirms.
JACOB: He saw this coming years ago. from his cell. I'm guessing he made off with billions. And he throws something on the table.
WINNIE: But what about the SEC, the regulatory agencies ?
JACOB: The government is flying this 700 billion dollar airplane by the seat of it's pants. They don't know where half of the fucking money is going. And even if they did, do you think they want this out there? As this all washes over her.
WINNIE: This is his revenge.
JACOB: Yup. sure beats the hell out of insider trading, doesn't it? And Winnie finds her keys and heads for the door.
WINNIE: I can't hear anymore of this. . but Jacob steps in front of her.
JACOB: I'm done. I sold everything. The ring. Everything. I gave back the KZI bonus. I'm out and I'm broke and I deserve it. And she just looks at him.
GORDON GEKKO: Did you see Barrons?
JACOB: You finally got the cover. Gordon nods.
GORDON GEKKO: The powers that be will never let that Jacob's not arguing it.
JACOB: How much is enough, Gordon? Gordon laughs with a shake of the head.
GORDON GEKKO: I've been asked that before.
JACOB: You're not going to miss America?
GORDON GEKKO: I'll always have America. it's why I'm here. I'm buying the island.
JACOB: What happened to the precious depreciating asset of time?
GORDON GEKKO: It still trades. And he turns to Jacob with a smile.
JACOB: I'm out, Gordon, I'm done trading.
GORDON GEKKO: I don't know why. You pulled it off, Kid, you took him down granted with my help but you atoned for Zabel's sins with Bretton's money.
JACOB: Did you ever really want to reconcile with her?
GORDON GEKKO: ( of course I did ) I'm human.
JACOB: Then why did you do it? And Gordon. strongly holding Jacob's glare. simply Same answer.
GORDON GEKKO: Same answer.
JACOB: But it didn't work. Gordon sadly shrugs.
GORDON GEKKO: I've been trying to wire two hundred million into her bank account but she won't accept it.
JACOB: I know. She doesn't want it. we don't want it.
GORDON GEKKO: That sounds good. I bet you can even wrap it in a pretty red bow. But Champ, it's idealistic. and idealism kills every trade.
JACOB: Winnie's pregnant. And Gordon stops walking.
GORDON GEKKO: What do you want?
JACOB: It's bad out there, Gordon, people are panicked. They're not looking to their government. They're not looking to their trusted advisors. They're looking to you.
GORDON GEKKO: You want me to buy? And Jacob Moore. slowly confirming.
JACOB: Publicly and aggressively. Gordon just looks at him.
GORDON GEKKO: We're far from the bottom. It'll be a dead cat bounce.
JACOB: It'll buy us time. That's all I'm asking for. time.
GORDON GEKKO: What do I get in return?
JACOB: Full clemency.
GORDON GEKKO: You can offer that?
JACOB: Your daughter can. She works with the new Secretary of Treasury now. Considering that.
GORDON GEKKO: What else?
JACOB: Winnie. Me. Your grandson. Something money can't buy. a family. And Gordon looks at him for the longest moments, allowing it all to register, then.
GORDON GEKKO: Sorry son that's simply a trade I cannot make. And as Gordon Gekko walks off. leaving Jacob Moore GORDON GEKKO ( V.O. ) ( CONT'D ) You wanna know what the mother of all bubbles was? Us. The human race. Scientists call it the Cambrian Explosion, from the Cambrian fauna.
