NICK'S POV: of the room shaking, accompanied by his heavy breathing. His eyes float from the Hustler to the pink walls of his room.
ESTELLE: Jerry? Where did that car come
JERRY: It's a '62 Lincoln convertible. Like the one Kennedy was shot in.
NICK: Except his was black and yours is white. And dirty.
JERRY: See that. I was going to take you and your mom for a spin after breakfast. But now I guess it'll just be her and me. You have your smart mouth to thank for that.
NICK: Damn it. I guess I'll just have to hang out all alone at the book The what?
JERRY: The what?
ESTELLE: Jerry, I don't understand. What happened to the Chevy-Nova?
JERRY: Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda Naval Air Base. A man should never own a car for more than three months, Estelle. That way he always gets the thrill of owning a new
SAILOR #1: Is Jerry here?
NICK: He just left. What's up?
SAILOR #1: What's up is that hunk of shit Chevy he sold us made it seventeen miles before the engine blew up.
SAILOR #2: And we found evidence of a banana in the transmission.
SAILOR #1: So he owes us nine hundred dollars.
NICK: Well, I think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln. He's giving my mom a joyride in it now. But he'll be back this afternoon, so I would come back then. He's pretty stubborn. You might have to beat it out of him.
SAILOR #1: That can be arranged. In the meantime we're leaving the piece of shit in the driveway. With a note.
NICK: I like it. Very to the point. Well. See you guys this
LEFTY: My sister said she saw Millie Filbert holding hands with some college guy.
NICK: I dunno, Lefty. I think your sister is just waging psychological Well it's working. What am I gonna do, Nick? I'm obsessed. I think about Millie so much my balls ache.
LEFTY: Well it's working. What am I gonna do, Nick? I'm obsessed. I think about Millie so much my balls ache.
NICK: Maybe your just not wacking off
NICK: Why don't you just have your parents take you to the dick Are you kidding? It would kill them to know that I even get hard-ons.
NICK: Still, you might want to get it fixed before asking Millie out.
JERRY: Nick, you little shit, get down
ESTELLE: Nick, do you know anything about
NICK: Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by. They want their money back. I guess there was a banana in the You tell them when I was coming Now why would I do that?
JERRY: You tell them when I was coming Now why would I do that?
NICK: Now why would I do that?
ESTELLE: What are you going to do, Jerry?
JERRY: I think I'll go get the Lincoln You're leaving? What happens when the sailor comes back for his nine- hundred dollars?
ESTELLE: You're leaving? What happens when the sailor comes back for his nine- hundred dollars?
JERRY: Just tell him he bought the car with my standard guarantee. Thirty days or thirty feet. Whichever comes first. I'm in the right. Oh, look. The sailors are here.
NICK: Oh, look. The sailors are here.
JERRY: Get rid of them!
NICK: Jerry, where are you going? Just tell them you are in the right.
SAILOR #1: Sixty-three lousy dollars.
JERRY: That's my life savings! Don't hurt him! Nick, call 911!
ESTELLE: Don't hurt him! Nick, call 911!
SAILOR #1: Touch that phone, kid, and you lose your left nut.
JERRY: Please. Please don't hurt me. It's all I got, guys. I swear. Take the I don't want the Lincoln. I want my nine-hundred dollars. I'm taking the sixty-three, which means you owe me another eight hundred and Eight hundred and thirty seven, Exactly. Have it by tomorrow or you'll be found in the trunk of your new used piece of shit at the bottom of the Bay.
SAILOR #1: I don't want the Lincoln. I want my nine-hundred dollars. I'm taking the sixty-three, which means you owe me another eight hundred and Eight hundred and thirty seven, Exactly. Have it by tomorrow or you'll be found in the trunk of your new used piece of shit at the bottom of the Bay.
NICK: Eight hundred and thirty seven, Exactly. Have it by tomorrow or you'll be found in the trunk of your new used piece of shit at the bottom of the Bay.
SAILOR #1: Exactly. Have it by tomorrow or you'll be found in the trunk of your new used piece of shit at the bottom of the Bay.
JERRY: Wow, those guys are even dumber than I thought. They actually think I'm stupid enough to let them muscle me into paying.
ESTELLE: Jerry, what are you talking about? We need to call the police!
JERRY: I'm not some tattle-tale like your
ESTELLE: Then for God's sake, Jerry, just sell the Lincoln and pay them!
JERRY: Can't. It's in The Code.
ESTELLE: What code? The vehicular code?
JERRY: Code of the streets, Babe. Code of the streets.
ESTELLE: Then what are you planning to do?
ESTELLE: Goodbye, everyone! We're going on Let's blow!
JERRY: Let's blow!
ESTELLE: Jerry.? You said it was a cabin.
JERRY: C'mon Estelle. It's real cute on the inside.
JERRY: I say the kid does the dishes and we retire to the master bedroom.
NICK: Mom? Do you really like Jerry?
ESTELLE: Nick, how many men do you think there are who'd be interested in a forty-one year old woman with two brats, no money, and stretch marks?
SHEENI: Your robe is open.
SHEENI: Hel-lo, Excitable Boy.
ESTELLE: Nick, honey, meet Sheeni Saunders.
NICK: Sheeni needs to go to the grocery store. I've offered her your help in carrying her bags.
ESTELLE: Sheeni needs to go to the grocery store. I've offered her your help in carrying her bags.
NICK: Thanks a pantsful.
NICK: You don't have to go to services?
SHEENI: No. Much to the consternation of my fanatical parents I have converted to atheism. Fortunately my brother, Paul, paved the way for such Paul is an atheist too?
NICK: Paul is an atheist too?
SHEENI: Buddhist, I believe, though we have not seen him in some time. I myself am looking forward to being free of parental bondage.
NICK: Well, your mother seems very nice, though your father I think might be rather dim.
SHEENI: Well, your mother seems very nice, though your father I think might be rather dim.
NICK: Jerry and I share no blood links of any kind. Sounds rather zealous.
NICK: Sounds rather zealous.
SHEENI: Yes, even though I am no longer a believer I always found the services wonderfully aerobic.
NICK: You could say the same thing about
SHEENI: Nick, are you going to turn out like all the other young men and have nothing on your mind except carnal pleasures?
NICK: I hardly ever think about sex.
SHEENI: Really? I think about it all the time. It's the hormones at work, you know.
NICK: Wow. A second floor.
SHEENI: Yes. Father bought it so that he could look down upon the world. For him, Christian humility has always been a struggle.
SHEENI: Well, it was nice to meet you,
NICK: Sheeni? Do you want to come to the beach with me?
SHEENI: What a thoughtful invitation. I'd love to, Nick. Wait for me in the living room.
SHEENI: Back in a moment.
NICK: Er, yes, Mr. Saunders.
MR. SAUNDERS: Aha! Then I trust, sir, you are aware that in doing so you have entered into an oral contract to perform in loco parentis, i.e. to provide for the safety and well- being of aforementioned minor Oh, Father, do shut up.
SHEENI: Let's go, Nick. Bye, Father.
MR. SAUNDERS: Vaya con Dios!
SHEENI: Would you mind applying this to my exposed areas?
NICK: Not at all.
SHEENI: My, you get turned on easily.
SHEENI: Oh, don't stop, Nick. We all have our hormones to deal with. Girls are fortunate in that it doesn't show. For all the world knows, my vagina could be moist with desire as we speak.
NICK: Is it?
SHEENI: That's none of your business, I'm sure. Shall you do my front too?
NICK: I'm up for it.
SHEENI: I hope you don't find it too stimulating, Nick.
NICK: I'm coping.
SHEENI: Uh, Nick. Maybe you better do the top now.
SHEENI: Thanks, Nick.
SHEENI: Breathless is one of my favorite films, though it might be eclipsed by Rebel Without a Cause. I often wonder what American cinema would be like today had Dean done more than three.
SHEENI: Oh, Nick. You seem very nice. But in fairness, I should tell you that I have a boyfriend.
NICK: What's his name?
SHEENI: Trent Preston.
NICK: What's he like?
SHEENI: Seventeen years of age, six-two, fluent in French, plays the piano, a champion swimmer, and writes Futurist Percussive poetry.
NICK: I'm not familiar with Futurist Percussive poems.
SHEENI: I could recite one of Trent's if you'd like.
NICK: Please do.
SHEENI: RamDam 12/ Sizzle mop/ Crunch down/ Safety net/ Hot! Hot! Hot!/ Void.
NICK: Good morning!
SHEENI: Nick? God what time is it?
NICK: Seven o'clock. How about breakfast?
SHEENI: ( smiling with endearment ) Come back in two hours. I'm going on a hike. You can join me if you'd
SHEENI: Nick, where are your hiking boots, water bottle, provisions, survey maps and compass?
NICK: Like John Muir I enter the wilderness with nothing more than my journal and a childlike sense of Okay, but I have no plans to baby any slackers.
SHEENI: Okay, but I have no plans to baby any slackers.
NICK: Quite a drop.
SHEENI: Yes. Not to be morbid, but this sight has been the chosen means of at least three teen suicides.
NICK: Huh. Quite a hike just to end your Well, there is a road. But I agree. Adolescents have a tendency toward the over-dramatic.
SHEENI: Well, there is a road. But I agree. Adolescents have a tendency toward the over-dramatic.
NICK: That's my journal!
SHEENI: Don't get so upset Nick. Though your handwriting is egregious, you have a fairly decent vocabulary. Although, Trent is not an "affected
NICK: Those are my private thoughts and are none of your business!
SHEENI: The lengths you say you are willing to go to to win my heart, the contemplation of suicide at the thought of not having me. It all evokes a strong emotional warmth in my breast.
NICK: The lengths you say you are willing to go to to win my heart, the contemplation of suicide at the thought of not having me. It all evokes a strong emotional warmth in my breast.
SHEENI: The lengths you say you are willing to go to to win my heart, the contemplation of suicide at the thought of not having me. It all evokes a strong emotional warmth in my breast.
SHEENI: Did you mean it, Nickie?
NICK: How would you like it if I read your journal?
SHEENI: You can read it if you'd like.
NICK: It's in French.
SHEENI: A necessity for a child in a household with prying Christian What does it say?
NICK: What does it say?
SHEENI: Wouldn't you like to know. That last passage would be of particular interest to you.
NICK: Spill it! I demand full disclosure!
SHEENI: They wrestle, perspiring, squirming bodies brushing together. Flashing super: Thundering Erection They pause. He's got her arms pinned. She's on her back. He hovers above her.
SHEENI: ( softly chanting ) Nickie's got a hard-on.
SHEENI: You're still a virgin, I can tell. Maybe that's why I like you.
SHEENI: Kiss me, you wienie.
SHEENI: Okay, lover. Break's over. Let's
NICK: When can I see you again?
SHEENI: Get up early tomorrow and you can shower with me in the ladies room. Five minutes to six. If you dare.
ESTELLE: So what's this Sheeni girl like?
NICK: She's the Encyclopedia Britannica.
JERRY: She's got a nice rack.
ESTELLE: Jerry chuckles. Nick stares at him, perhaps resolving to murder the trucker in his sleep.
MRS. SAUNDERS: RAPE! RAAAAAPE!
RAPE! RAAAAAPE!: Suddenly the door opens. It's Sheeni in her robe. She reaches out and pulls Nick up.
SHEENI: Get out quick!
NICK: Should I go to the sheriff's now?
SHEENI: No. I managed to convince Mother you were retarded and couldn't read the sign.
NICK: Say, where were you anyway? We said five minutes to six.
SHEENI: I'm sorry. But, Nick, women are always discreetly late. It's expected of us.
NICK: Swell. And the punctual guy fries in the chair for rape.
SHEENI: Don't complain. At least you got to shower with a naked woman. What are your plans today?
NICK: My parents want to go to Middletown. Jerry has the moronic notion of buying a trailer there before we leave.
SHEENI: I should like to come with you, Nick. The more time we spend together the better. I fear when you leave we might never see each other again.
JERRY: What's your cash price?
GEEZER: I said in the ad. Thousand dollars Thousand, huh? That must be with a As is, where she is.
JERRY: Thousand, huh? That must be with a As is, where she is.
GEEZER: As is, where she is.
JERRY: I don't know. Those rusty propane tanks are a fire hazard. The roof probably needs work. I couldn't go above eight hundred.
GEEZER: I might take nine fifty.
JERRY: Nine hundred.
SHEENI: Look, Nick!
NICK: ( to the geezer ) How much?
SHEENI: ( to the geezer ) How much?
GEEZER: Ten dollars. All I have is a Subway card with four stickers.
NICK: All I have is a Subway card with four stickers.
GEEZER: No doubt close to the dog's actual Oh, thank you, Nickie!
NICK: No doubt close to the dog's actual Oh, thank you, Nickie!
SHEENI: Oh, thank you, Nickie!
SHEENI: I'm going to name him Albert.
GEEZER: That don't sound like any kind of name for a dog.
SHEENI: ( scowling defensively ) I'll have you know I've named him after the deceased French writer, Albert Camus. Author of L'Etranger and other works of existential
NICK: Sheeni, I think I love you.
SHEENI: Well, your hormones certainly do. And oddly enough, my hormones like you too.
NICK: Sheeni? It's. It's okay. We can visit each other when I get a drivers license.
SHEENI: I hope that's true, but.. It's not that. It's.
NICK: It's my parents. They're. I fear they will never allow me to keep Nick, honey. Why don't you take Albert? He could be our love child.
SHEENI: It's my parents. They're. I fear they will never allow me to keep Nick, honey. Why don't you take Albert? He could be our love child.
NICK: Nick tries to hide his hurt. Picks up the paper with
SHEENI: ( SNIFFLING ) Nick, honey. Why don't you take Albert? He could be our love child.
NICK: No way.
SHEENI: At least you could consider it, honey. For me. I've never asked you for anything before.
NICK: Maybe I could take him, but I'd have certain conditions. I would have to be the only dad on the Trent would have to go.
SHEENI: That's asking a lot. Trent worships the ground I walk on.
NICK: It's your choice. Life with me and the dog you love. Or a pet-free existence with a shallow, egotistical poet.
SHEENI: OK, Nick, I guess I don't have any choice. I'll break up with Trent. But if he kills himself it's on your conscience.
NICK: I accept full responsibility.
SHEENI: Well, good, that's settled.
NICK: Not quite, darling. I want one more What do you think?
SHEENI: What do you think?
NICK: What do you think?
SHEENI: Do you have a condom?
SHEENI: It has to be in a safe place. A nice comfortable bed. With no threat of interruptions. And for relaxation and mood setting some good red wine, preferably French. I want a new condom. Not one that's been riding around in your wallet for years. Consumers rated them a while back. I suggest you get their top-rated brand. This may take some research in the library. I'd appreciate a photocopy of the article. Plus, for supplementary protection, I want a name brand How about I have a quick vasectomy just to be on the safe side?
NICK: How about I have a quick vasectomy just to be on the safe side?
SHEENI: ( matter of fact ) Well, Nick, that, of course, is up to you.
ESTELLE: Nick, honey, say goodbye to Sheeni. It's time to hit the road.
SHEENI: ( whispering in his ear ) Don't forget, darling. Red wine and Consumer Reports.
JERRY: Okay. Back to civilization!
JERRY: You see that, Babe. They caved.
NICK: I guess they didn't cave after all.
JERRY: Boy, everything's complete. There's even water in the windshield How did they ever get it in here? My front door can't be more than three feet wide.
ESTELLE: How did they ever get it in here? My front door can't be more than three feet wide.
JERRY: Looks like they brought it in piece by piece and then reassembled it.
ESTELLE: But it would take an army of mechanics to do all that!
JERRY: Or a navy, Babe. Or a navy.
ESTELLE: Nick, your sister came all the way from LA for a weekend visit!
NICK: INT. ESTELLE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT Albert chews on Jerry's sock under the table.
JERRY: Can someone do something about the
ESTELLE: I don't know, Jerry. Can someone do something about the monstrosity dripping oil in my living room?
JOANIE: Yeah, I noticed that. What's the Jerry tried to outsmart a few sailors. It's been an amusing saga. OK, Babe, I guess when I come back from my next haul I'll just have to take it apart piece by piece.
NICK: Jerry tried to outsmart a few sailors. It's been an amusing saga. OK, Babe, I guess when I come back from my next haul I'll just have to take it apart piece by piece.
JERRY: OK, Babe, I guess when I come back from my next haul I'll just have to take it apart piece by piece.
JOANIE: Up to anything scandalous these days, Nick?
NICK: I was going to ask you the same What do you mean?
JOANIE: What do you mean?
JOANIE: Not that it's any of your business, but I've taken a class to improve my posture.
ESTELLE: I think Joanie looks very nice. And she has a new boyfriend too.
NICK: Did you meet him in posture class?
ESTELLE: Nick met a nice girl in Ukiah.
JOANIE: Really now? Are you on each others' Myspace pages?
NICK: Hardly. Sheeni believes the internet will be the end of So it's to be a torturous snail mail exchange, huh?
JOANIE: So it's to be a torturous snail mail exchange, huh?
NICK: More like the occassional collect Collect calls? And just who do you expect to pay for that?
ESTELLE: Collect calls? And just who do you expect to pay for that?
JERRY: Hey, Nick. Want to learn how a car is put together?
NICK: No, thanks. Auto mechanics doesn't interest me.
JERRY: See, Estelle, I told you the kid was queer-eeAAAAHHHHH!
JERRY: Damn it! The dog!
ESTELLE: Nick, put the dog in the basement.
ESTELLE: Nick, that was your father on the phone. He lost his job.
NICK: How unlike him.
ESTELLE: Watch your smart mouth. This means the end of child support.
NICK: Which means.
ESTELLE: You'll have to start going to.
NICK: OPERATOR ( V.O. )
NICK: Nick looks around, opens the door to the linen closet and darts inside.
NICK: Sheeni? How are you?
NICK: And how is Trent? Not too suicidal I hope.
SHEENI: Of course, he was disconsolate, but we talked all day and he's come to see this as an opportunity for growth. Oh, and Nick, Trent wanted me to tell you that he bears you no ill will.
NICK: Nor I him. I wish him all the best.
SHEENI: His parents are sending him to a French speaking boarding school this year. He's sure to get along there. So how is my darling Albert?
NICK: Well, though he's taken a disliking to Jerry.
SHEENI: And you, Nickie? How are you?
NICK: I regret, Love of My Life, my father has lost his job and I will now be forced to go to public How unfortunate. What did he do?
SHEENI: How unfortunate. What did he do?
NICK: He's a writer - sort of. He writes advertising copy.
SHEENI: ( pensive beat ) Nick, I suggest we look at your father's firing as a blessing in How so?
NICK: How so?
SHEENI: I propose we get your father a job here in Ukiah and you can come and live with him.
NICK: Brilliant. Not that I'm fond of Ukiah, but I'd live in a drainage culvert to be with you.
SHEENI: Oh, Nickie. Now, I happen to know Progressive Plywood is looking for an assistant editor. It would be perfect for your father.
NICK: I had no idea you had knowledge of the employment opportunities of trade magazines.
SHEENI: The owner is the father of a friend of mine.
NICK: Anyone I know?
SHEENI: Okay, it's Trent's father. So what?
NICK: So why would Trent want to help my father move to Ukiah?
SHEENI: I told you, darling. Trent harbors you no ill will. I will have him call your father up pretending to be a head hunter.
NICK: Very well, but I don't see how I am to live with him. My mother values my indentured servitude.
SHEENI: You must influence her to send you away. I feel this will require being in a constant state of open revolt on your part.
NICK: What do you want me to do?
SHEENI: I propose you rent the film Rebel Without a Cause as soon as possible. You must emulate James
SHEENI: .You must be bad, Nickie. Be very, very bad.
NICK: I will, darling. I will!
ESTELLE: Kids? This is Officer Lance Wescott. He has some bad news.

ALBERT'S POV: as we lunge at Lance's crotch.
NICK: Where's Joanie?
ESTELLE: She's sleeping in.
NICK: No doubt. I don't think anyone got a wink last night with all that
NICK: I thought there were laws in this city against illicit cohabitation. Or are they just another big policeman's joke?
LANCE: Kid, you are asking for trouble.
NICK: What are you going to do? Shoot me with your gun?
ESTELLE: No, Lance! Nickie, go to your room.
ESTELLE: Where do you think you're going?
NICK: The screen door slams behind him.
ESTELLE: What the in God's name has gotten into you?!? Jerry paid good money for that trailer!
NICK: And just what makes you so sure it was me?
ESTELLE: Who the hell else would write such a thing?
ESTELLE: And just how do you explain this?
NICK: That's Lacey.
ESTELLE: And just who the hell is Lacey?
NICK: Dad's girlfriend. His girlfriend? What are you doing with a picture like this of your father's girlfriend?
ESTELLE: His girlfriend? What are you doing with a picture like this of your father's girlfriend?
JOANIE: C'mon, Mom, all boys his age have pictures like that to.
ESTELLE: When I want your opinion on raising my child, I'll ask for it.
CURIOUS ): And what's this Lacey tart like?
NICK: Well, she likes fast cars and takes a lot of naps with dad.
NICK: She likes to sit on Dad's lap while he eats and blow in his ear.
NICK: And she calls him "Thunder Rod" and he calls her "Sugar Puss."
ESTELLE: You are confined to your room until school starts, you sick pervert.
NICK: I wish I was leaving with you Your day will come. I never thought mine would, but it did. Was all that stuff about Lacey and Dad made I wish. Did you really take a posture class?
JOANIE: Your day will come. I never thought mine would, but it did. Was all that stuff about Lacey and Dad made I wish. Did you really take a posture class?

JOANIE: Implants. I wanted them all my
NICK: Hey, Lefty.
LEFTY: What's with your mom, Nick? She gave me the third degree just to come up here.
NICK: I vandalized Jerry's trailer and she found my picture of Lacey.
LEFTY: Well, good thing I stole this from the bookstore then.
LEFTY: I was reading it all last night. Boy, having sex is a lot more complicated than I thought. Did you know you were supposed to stick your pinkie in her bumhole?
NICK: You lie.
LEFTY: No way, man. Here, I got the page
NICK: Yeah, but I'm not sure I should try this on Sheeni. I think this book is for people who've been married so long they're disgusted by the sight of each other.
LEFTY: Are we really supposed to be that. uh. big?
NICK: I think these illustrations are disproportionate for emphasis.
LEFTY: Maybe we should compare.
NICK: Perhaps we should. Just for the sake of research.
ESTELLE: She hurls the tray of food at them. Lefty bolts. Nick hastily tries to pull up his pants as his mother chases him around the room, grabbing up objects and hurling them his way.

NICK: Thanks a pantsful, but I'm not gay. If you're really concerned though, I suggest you get me a room at the Ukiah Motel 6. If anyone can straighten me out, it's Sheeni.
ESTELLE: That sounds more like a job for your father. Here, he wants to talk to you.
NICK: ( into phone ) So what's this I hear about you being gay?
GEORGE: So what's this I hear about you being gay?
NICK: What's this I hear about you being Yes, but my condition is only temporary. I can change it.
GEORGE: Yes, but my condition is only temporary. I can change it.
NICK: I hope you do. We need the money.
GEORGE: Nick, there are more important things in life than money.

GEORGE: I've got two words for you. Safe Thanks, Dad.
NICK: Thanks, Dad.
NICK: Hello, uh. My name is Nick. Nick Twisp. My father's name is George Has he hit you, Nick?

LEFTY: You'll never believe who called me, Nick. Millie Filbert!
NICK: What?!? Why?
LEFTY: I dunno. She just called and asked if I wanted to hang out tonight. I didn't want to ask why. I need to find someplace for us to get it on.

LEFTY: Right on.
NICK: So where you headed anyway?
LEFTY: Dr. Browerly's office. My parents are making me see a shrink now.
NICK: He asking lots of weird questions?
LEFTY: You bet your left nut he is! He asked if I had any lustful thoughts toward my sister.
NICK: What did you tell him?
LEFTY: I told him about beating off once with her brassiere.
NICK: What did you tell him that for?
LEFTY: You don't know what it's like. I think they release chemicals in their office to make you tell the Sounds like a professional. He must be very expensive.
NICK: Sounds like a professional. He must be very expensive.
LEFTY: I wouldn't know. The bill goes to your house.
NICK: My mom is paying for your therapy?

ESTELLE: Oh, Lance, can't something be done?
LANCE: Tell you what, Estelle. I'll make out that Nick reported the car and trailer stolen before the fire. It'll be less suspicious. But I could take some serious heat for Oh, Lance! You're wonderful! How can I possibly repay you?
ESTELLE: Oh, Lance! You're wonderful! How can I possibly repay you?
LANCE: I'll think of something, Estelle.
LANCE: Now the kid better not be here when the detectives start coming around. I'd send him away for a while. A long while.

NICK: Are you through?

LEFTY: No. I did not get to blow my wad.
NICK: Did you get interrupted?
LEFTY: No. Worse.
NICK: What's worse than being Millie is a lesbian.
LEFTY: Millie is a lesbian.

WHAT?!?: The only reason she wanted to hang out with me is because she heard that I showed you my slinky and thought I was gay too.
LEFTY: The only reason she wanted to hang out with me is because she heard that I showed you my slinky and thought I was gay too.
NICK: Sorry, man. I didn't have a great night either.
LEFTY: Well, I dunno what you're gonna do, but I'm giving suicide serious consideration this time.
NICK: Or you could just fake it and then hide out in Ukiah with me. Then later come back and maybe Millie Filbert will boink you out of pity.
LEFTY: Hey, that's not a bad idea. Thanks a pantsful, Nick.
LACEY: Hiya, Nick!
NICK: Hi, Lacey. Hi, Dad.
NICK: Is there any way I could sit up front with Lacey, Dad? Mom's boyfriend beat me pretty badly.

GEORGE: Go ahead and bring your stuff inside. Lacey and I need a nap. C'mon, Sugar Puss.
NICK: Uhm, hello. Is Sheeni available?
MR. SAUNDERS: She most certainly is not. As a matter of fact, we've banned you from her life, Nick Twisp.
NICK: Excuse me?
MR. SAUNDERS: Trent Preston informed us that not only were you moving here to pursue my daughter, but that you're not even mentally-handicapped, and thus molested my wife in the shower of sound mind and body.
NICK: That rat-fink-fuck!
MR. SAUNDERS: You watch your language. This is a Christian home. We're sending Sheeni to Les École des Arts and Literatures in Santa Cruz.
NICK: Santa Cruz! But she'll be miserable without me. We're in love.
MR. SAUNDERS: Then I guess it's a good thing Trent is going there too. She'll have someone to console her.

SHEENI: I had to sneak away just to see That's okay. I had to burn down half of Berkley.
NICK: That's okay. I had to burn down half of Berkley.

SHEENI: Nick, Trent betrayed us.
NICK: François will kill him later.
SHEENI: Who's François?
NICK: Nevermind. The point is we must
SHEENI: I don't know, Nick. I do love you, but I don't want to spend the rest of our lives on the run.

SHEENI: Nick Twisp, I will not allow you to accept defeat so easily!
NICK: Or we could consummate here in the Did you bring the consumer reports?

NICK: Wow, Lefty, I'm kinda impressed. Faking your suicide is pretty
LEFTY: So where you headed?
NICK: Redwood High School.
LEFTY: Can I come?
NICK: Why would you want to go to school if you didn't have to?
LEFTY: It's weird, Nick, but school seems like a pretty fun place to hang out once you get rid of classes and I can see this stunt really has liberated your mind.
NICK: I can see this stunt really has liberated your mind.
LEFTY: I'm telling you, Nick: killing myself was the best thing that ever happened to me.
VIJAY: May I sit at your table?
LEFTY: Sure. I'm Lefty and this is Nick.
VIJAY: I am Vijay Joshi.

NICK: Do you have a girlfriend?
VIJAY: Not at the moment. But I am optimistic. How about you?
NICK: Yes, but she transferred.
VIJAY: You don't mean Sheeni Saunders. I heard she was interested in some brilliant fellow in the Bay Area.
LEFTY: Hey, that's you, Nick.
VIJAY: I'm surprised. You are not at all what I imagined.
VIJAY: So how is Sheeni?
NICK: I don't know. She sent me this letter. But it's in French.
VIJAY: Shall I translate it for you?
NICK: You speak French?
VIJAY: I speak French, English, Hindi, Marathi, and Urdu.
LEFTY: That must come in handy.
VIJAY: Dear, Nick.
SHEENI: Perhaps you should consider learning French and enrolling. That

NICK: That's it? Nothing else about me?
VIJAY: Oh yes. Love to you and Albert. Who's Albert?
NICK: Albert is our dog. This is a disaster. What the hell does she mean Trent wants to mend the I don't know, but this Taggarty girl sounds very uninhibited. I wonder if she's made it with a Hindu yet.
VIJAY: I don't know, but this Taggarty girl sounds very uninhibited. I wonder if she's made it with a Hindu yet.
LEFTY: Heather sounds like a babe. You think if I grew a beard I'd pass for college age?
NICK: I've got to get to Sheeni as soon as possible. If I don't Trent Preston is going to mindfuck her into thinking she doesn't like me.
LEFTY: And then he'll probably fuck her in other ways. Did you know you're supposed to put your pinkie in a girl's bumhole, Vijay?
NICK: Will you shut up and help me out?
LEFTY: Sorry, Nick. What should we do?
NICK: I suggest we steal my father's BMW and take a trip to Santa Cruz. Vijay, you'll have to be our But what will we tell our parents?
VIJAY: But what will we tell our parents?
LEFTY: You can tell your father you are staying at Nick's house for the weekend. And visa versa.
NICK: Good thinking.
VIJAY: But what if we are caught?
NICK: To hell with it, Vijay. It's time to take action!
LEFTY: What is this music, Nick?
NICK: It's Dave Brubeck. I thought a person as cultured as yourself would appreciate it.
VIJAY: You want culture? I will give you
SHEENI: Nick, Vijay, and Lefty are noticeably shorter than the older boys around them.
NICK: Hello, Sheeni. Hi, I'm Nick.
TAGGARTY: Oh. So you're Nick.
HEATHER: We've heard so much about you.
NICK: And this is Vijay. And this is Lefty. Lefty goes to USC.
LEFTY: And I'm not gay.
SHEENI: Nick, I knew you'd come! .but you must wait in the car until we can sneak you in.
SHEENI: .but you must wait in the car until we can sneak you in.
HEATHER: Lefty, should maybe sleep in my room. It's pretty crowded in here.
LEFTY: Your roommate won't mind?
HEATHER: Oh, Darlene went home for the
LEFTY: Well, see you guys in the morning.
SHEENI: Pardon me, everyone.
NICK: There's your competition.
VIJAY: A distinguished group I would be happy to join.
VIJAY: I am in a state of sexual frenzy. What is your plan?
NICK: We drape a blanket over the lower bunk for Sheeni and me. You tackle Taggarty on the top bunk. Here's a condom. I slipped two to Lefty, leaving us with four.
VIJAY: What if they don't go for it?
NICK: They'll go for it. You can cut the sexual tension in that room with a Don't be silly, darling. Not with others in the room. We must wait until everyone falls
SHEENI: Don't be silly, darling. Not with others in the room. We must wait until everyone falls
TAGGERTY: Goodnight boys. Do you need the light on to take off your clothes?
NICK: ( flipping off the light ) We can find our zippers in the
NICK: Yes, Nick?
SHEENI: Yes, Nick?
NICK: Was that the matron?
SHEENI: Then who was it?
NICK: Then who was it?
SHEENI: It was Trent. Did you say it was Trent?
NICK: Did you say it was Trent?
SHEENI: Yes. He came to discuss our friendship. I told him now was not the time.
NICK: So where is Trent now?
SHEENI: I assume he went back to the boys' dorm. Now really, Nickie, you are keeping everyone awake with your
FRANÇOIS: Now is our chance.
NICK: Chance for what?
FRANÇOIS: To confront our nemesis. We must go to the boys' dorm and kill Trent where he sleeps.
NICK: I suppose we should at least get a look at him. To see what we're dealing with.
FRANÇOIS: Very well.
CIGARETTE ): You see what we are dealing with. and zen I wll deal wiz it.
NICK: No. Who the hell are you?
ED: No. Who the hell are you?
NICK: I am Nick Twisp.
ED: Oh, so you're Nick.
NICK: Is Trent here?
ED: You just missed him, Nick. He just grabbed a couple condoms and left.
NICK: Did he say where he was going?
ED: I think he said he was going to Heather's room.
NICK: But that's where Lefty is. Who are Ed. Ed Solomon. Trent's roommate.
ED: Ed. Ed Solomon. Trent's roommate.
NICK: Oh, so you're Ed.
ED: What's that supposed to mean?
NICK: Nothing. It's just that Sheeni mentioned Trent has a thing for a guy named Ed, and that he touches the guy when he falls asleep. But obviously if that were you, you'd know about it. Must be a different Ed Solomon. Take care now.
HEATHER: What's up, Nick?
NICK: Is Trent in there?
HEATHER: Not anymore.
NICK: What happened to Lefty?
HEATHER: Trent was here, but he left. He only dropped by to lend us a couple more condoms.
NICK: But I gave Lefty two already.
HEATHER: Yes, and that was very generous of you, but the night is young.
NICK: So what is Trent, the fucking condom faerie!?!
LEFTY: You can have one of ours, Nick. If you need one. So where did he say he was going?
NICK: So where did he say he was going?
HEATHER: He didn't say, but I'm pretty sure I just saw him go into our bathroom down the hall.
NICK: Thanks. Oh, and I'd be careful with those condoms. Trent's roommate Ed said that Trent pokes holes in them so that he can get Sheeni pregnant and be with her forever.
BERNICE: Who are you?
NICK: I'm Sheeni's friend, Nick. Sorry to disturb you.
BERNICE: That's OK. It was something I ate. So wait, are you Sheeni's Uh, yeah.
NICK: Uh, yeah.
BERNICE: My name's Bernice. Bernice Lynch. Not that you asked.
NICK: Nice to meet you Bernice. Actually, I think Trent Preston mentioned you. He said you were frumpy, but now that I've met you, I can see Trent is a lying bastard.
BERNICE: Thanks. And Trent can go to hell for all I care. Sheeni too.
NICK: You don't like Sheeni?
BERNICE: Personally, I hate her guts. Well, pardon me, Nick. I feel like throwing up some more now.
NICK: You didn't happen to see Trent Preston did you?
BERNICE: I did actually. I think he was on his way to Sheeni's room.
NICK: Yes, darling.
SHEENI: Yes, darling.
NICK: Was Trent here?
SHEENI: Yes, Nick.
SHEENI: But I sent him away again.
SHEENI: Because I want you, darling. Not even Trent can match the industriousness and tenacity with which you have pursued me.
MATRON: Q'est que c'est passer ici?!?
LEFTY: I did it three times! Two long ones and a quickie.
NICK: Great. Just great. How about you, It was difficult to tell with that condom, Nick. Why did you buy such thick ones?
VIJAY: It was difficult to tell with that condom, Nick. Why did you buy such thick ones?
NICK: That brand was top-rated by Well, she's safe. No organism could penetrate those walls.
VIJAY: Well, she's safe. No organism could penetrate those walls.
NICK: You think the girls are in trouble?
VIJAY: They will likely notify their parents. Perhaps even expel them.
NICK: That's it! Expel them. Then Sheeni will have to come back to Ukiah.
VIJAY: What will we do?
NICK: Well, we can't stay in the car. Sooner or later Highway Patrol is going to come by and ask for our non-existent driver's license.
LEFTY: But we have no money!
VIJAY: I have no shoes! I'll catch pneumonia and die a indeterminate

NICK: What happened to Lance?
ESTELLE: Lance is busy training to be a detective. He isn't around as much as he used to be.
ESTELLE: Mr. Rumpkin is very smart. Ask him a question, Nick.
NICK: Okay. Mr. Rumpkin, what famous actress was married to Frank Sinatra, Artie Shaw, and Mickey Whoever she is, she sure gets Ava Gardner.
LEFTY: Whoever she is, she sure gets Ava Gardner.
WALLY: Ava Gardner.
ESTELLE: That's nothing. You should see what he did with the living room.
ESTELLE: Go ahead, Wally. Show them.
WALLY: Well, uhm. It was nice meeting you, Nick.
NICK: You too, Mr. Rumpkin.
NICK: Where's Dad?
LACEY: In the bedroom. I wouldn't bother him, Nick. He's in a foul mood. He's on with the police. Apparently someone broke in and stole his
DWAYNE: Nick, you got a girlfriend?
NICK: Yes, I do.
DWAYNE: If you asked your girlfriend as a favor, would she do it with me?
NICK: Guys don't share their girlfriends.
DWAYNE: I get ya. You're worried `cause your girlfriend might get knocked up. What if I pull out, Nick?
LACEY: It's not my fault, you tight-assed, critical, nonfeeling, sexist drunk.
LACEY: Does it bother you that you're a selfish, uptight, boring lover?
NICK: You forgot lousy driver!
GEORGE: That's strike two, jerkoff!
LACEY: ( PAUSE ) Thank you.
LACEY: They found your car in Davenport, George. Go pick it up.
GEORGE: Look who's wearing the pants this
LACEY: Nick, I feel for you. It must be tough being a teenager in this My mother wasn't any better.
NICK: My mother wasn't any better.
LACEY: Your mom has had a difficult time. She has had a great deal to put up with. I'm starting to appreciate that now.
GEORGE: Are you by any chance referring to If the shoe fits, suck on it.
LACEY: If the shoe fits, suck on it.
GEORGE: We'll see who's sucking on what I spoke with Taggarty this morning. She requested a wallet sized photo.
VIJAY: I spoke with Taggarty this morning. She requested a wallet sized photo.
LEFTY: Congratulations, Vijay. That makes it official. Welcome to the club.
NICK: What grade did you receive?
VIJAY: A C+. Which I feel is perfectly satisfactory given the conditions.
LEFTY: I guess this means they're not being expelled.
VIJAY: No, apparently they convinced the matron it was all quite innocent.
NICK: Are you kidding? She had her flashlight trained on your Hindi
VIJAY: No need to be jealous, Nick.
NICK: Dear Bernice, it was nice meeting you this weekend in the bathroom.
NICK: Where's Dad?
LACEY: ( DREAMILY ) Daddy is in Davenport. Where you left his car.

GEORGE: Nick? Is that you?
NICK: I am Nick Twisp. I am alive. I am a breathing organism.
GEORGE: Quit fooling around, Nick. This is your dad. Is everything okay there?
NICK: Don't be afraid, Dad. Everything will be okay. You deserve to be What the hell is that supposed to mean? Is Lacey there?
GEORGE: What the hell is that supposed to mean? Is Lacey there?
NICK: Lacey is here. Paul is caressing her toes.
GEORGE: Paul! Who the hell is Paul?
NICK: Paul is our friend. He makes beautiful music for the acrobats. They're naked.
GEORGE: Who's naked? Is Lacey naked?
NICK: Don't be afraid, Dad. Goodbye.
NICK: Dad is afraid.
LACEY: He is on the wrong path. I have felt that for some time.
LIVING ROOM: where Paul stands between George and Lacey.
PAUL: Okay, George, just calm down.
GEORGE: You are in serious trouble. You've assaulted me and I know for a fact that you two were having naked orgies with my son. That child is only twelve years old.
NICK: I'm sixteen, Dad.
GEORGE: Shut your pie hole!
PAUL ): That boy is an underaged minor. I'm going to have you arrested and charged with child molesting.
LACEY: Don't be an idiot, George. No one was naked.
GEORGE: When you get out of prison, you will both have to register as sex offenders. You will never be able to get a decent job again.
PAUL: I've never had a decent job. I don't think I'd want one.
LACEY: Let's go, Paul. George, I'll pick up the rest of my things tomorrow.
GEORGE: Not until you pay me the rest of the money you owe.
LACEY: I paid you all your money!
GEORGE: Not the extra charges.
LACEY: As Lacey and Paul depart, Nick turns and dreamily wanders back toward his room.
DWAYNE: What's all the ruckus about?
NICK: Dwayne! Please cover yourself.
DWAYNE: You wanna play Nintendo all night?
NICK: Of course not. I'm tired. Let's go to sleep.
NICK: Wake up! I know what you were doing last night, you disgusting beast!
DWAYNE: Don't be mad, Nick. I like you.
MRS. CRAMPTON: Boys, time to get AHH! Dwayne! Where's yer pajamas?
DWAYNE: Nick made me take them off, Mom. He took off his too.
MRS. CRAMPTON: You leave my son alone. Don't go co'rupt him with yer nastiness!
NICK: We weren't doing anything, Mrs. Crampton. It was just hot last If you get hot, boys, open a window. Don't go takin' off yer pajamas. That's nasty.
MRS. CRAMPTON: If you get hot, boys, open a window. Don't go takin' off yer pajamas. That's nasty.
NICK: Taggarty? It's Nick.
TAGGARTY: Hey, Nick. I suppose you want to talk to Sheeni.
NICK: If you please.
TAGGARTY: It's your would-be-lover.
SHEENI: Hello, My Beloved. How are you?
NICK: Hello, My Beloved. How are you?
SHEENI: Not so well. I have been afflicted with some kind of chronic fatigue.
NICK: Perhaps you are home sick. You do sound rather blue.
SHEENI: I'm not home sick, Nick. In fact, I'm not very happy with you.
NICK: Me? What did I do?
SHEENI: You know damn well, Nick. You've been spreading rumors about Trent. And he doesn't deserve it.
NICK: Doesn't deserve it!?! I'd have to claim he has genital warts to sink to his level.
SHEENI: Well, whatever you said to Ed Solomon, it was enough to get him to give Trent a black eye.
NICK: Sheeni, I just don't get it. This guy has cock-blocked at every turn and you're taking his side?!?
SHEENI: ( SIGHS ) We'll have to resume this another time, Nick. It's been an emotionally exhausting weekend. My parents are in an uproar over Paul. He's moved some floozie in with him up in the studio over the garage.
NICK: Lacey's not a floozie.
SHEENI: Lacey? You know her?
NICK: Of course. She's my father's ex- girlfriend. I think that might make you my stepmother-in-law.
SHEENI: Nick. Don't be gross.
NICK: Sorry. At any rate, I'll let you go. We'll have plenty of time to settle this tomorrow.
SHEENI: Yes, Sheeni, Thanksgiving. I'll be coming for dinner, of course.
NICK: Yes, Sheeni, Thanksgiving. I'll be coming for dinner, of course.
SHEENI: Don't even think it, Nick. You know my parents don't approve of you.
NICK: I'm confident they will learn to love me. After all, I'm practically Nick, you must dismiss this Thanksgiving notion from your mind. I remain firm on this issue.
SHEENI: Nick, you must dismiss this Thanksgiving notion from your mind. I remain firm on this issue.
NICK: Don't move, blubber boy, I'll get
POLICE OFFICER: Is George Twisp in?
NICK: Uh, I'm pretty sure he's sleeping off a hangover, Officer. Is he under arrest?
POLICE OFFICER: Under arrest? No, I'm the officer working the case of his stolen car.
NICK: POLICE OFFICER
POLICE OFFICER: You can tell your pop that the CD he found in his car is Ravi Excuse me?
NICK: Excuse me?
POLICE OFFICER: Indian music. So we're a checkin' the INS files, see if we can get some prints that match. You wouldn't know anyone who might have stolen the car who listens to this crap, would ya, son?
NICK: No, and I'm not sure I like the implication. Ravi Shankar is beloved by many Caucasian.
DWAYNE: I'm pretty sure he's Injun.
POLICE OFFICER: ( to himself ) Vijay Joshi. We'll look into it. Thank you, boys.
LIVING ROOM: where the phone RINGS. He flips off the stereo with the remote and snatches up the phone.
NICK: Twisp residence.
NICK: Oh. Hey, Mom. What's up?
NICK: Okay. I'm ready. What is it?
NICK: What's the bad news?
NICK: Lefty, have you seen Vijay, today?
LEFTY: Nick, haven't you heard? Vijay's been arrested.
NICK: For grand theft auto. They found his prints in your father's car.
LEFTY: For grand theft auto. They found his prints in your father's car.
NICK: That's terrible. Did he go quietly?
LEFTY: No. He said you were his accomplice and now the Ukiah police are looking for you!
PAUL: Hello, Nick. Right on time. Come
NICK: Happy Thanksgiving, Lacey.
LACEY: What interesting flowers, Nick. Who are they for?
NICK: Uh, Mrs. Saunders.
LACEY: Mr. and Mrs. Saunders, you remember Nick Twisp, don't you?
MR. SAUNDERS: You are very, very tall.
PAUL: No he's not, Dad. He just appears tall because you are on the floor.
MR. SAUNDERS: I can feel the floor pushing against me. Can you feel it too, tall youth? Paul served an appetizer earlier.
LACEY: Paul served an appetizer earlier.
PAUL: Yes, it's a recipe I picked up in the Southwest. Stuffed mushrooms.
TAGGERTY: How is the star-crossed persistent
NICK: Okay, I guess. Where's Sheeni?
TAGGERTY: Upstairs, Nick. She saw you coming and hid in her room.
NICK: Dinner is almost ready, My Love.
SHEENI: I do not intend to be party to my brother's absurdities. He has allowed you in and drugged my I think they are deriving some good from the experience.
NICK: I think they are deriving some good from the experience.
SHEENI: What are you doing here, Nick? I expressly asked you not to come.
NICK: To hell with that. What do I have to do to prove my love to you? My friends have gotten laid and I'm pretty sure neither one of them was beaten with a tree trunk, raped by a walrus, or had to contend with the likes of Trent Preston!
SHEENI: You were raped by a walrus?
NICK: Sheeni, I have shown restraint, I have committed crimes, I have traveled to the lengths of the state and still you won't give me this one little thing.
SHEENI: Sex, Nick. Why don't you just say it? That's what you want. You want me to have sex with you.
NICK: ( BEAT ) Well. YEAH!
SHEENI: How is my dog?
NICK: Excellent. He should be coming out of the oven right about now.
SHEENI: I hate you, Nickie!
NICK: I hate you too.
LACEY: Dear Lord.
LACEY: Dear Lord, thank you for this bounty. Help us to be tolerant of others - especially the boyfriends and girlfriends of our immediate relations. Amen.
EVERYONE: They begin eating. A helicopter passes by outside, search light briefly coming through the windows. Nick watches Mr. Saunders take a handful of mashed potatoes and apply it to his face like war paint.
MRS. SAUNDERS: Paul? Your father looks rather Well, mother, he is sitting in his own bowel movement.
PAUL: Well, mother, he is sitting in his own bowel movement.
MRS. SAUNDERS: That's no excuse.
TAGGARTY: The food is delicious, Paul.
PAUL: Thank you.

JOANIE: Nick, you've stolen, vandalized, trespassed, and burned down Berkeley. All for one girl. If there's a misunderstanding, it's with your insight into females.
NICK: But. But where did I go wrong?
JOANIE: Nick, boys your age are always looking for the path of least resistance to becoming a man. A boy's whole self-esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into So far, I agree.
NICK: So far, I agree.
JOANIE: Sooner or later what those boys realize, is that the girls you're chasing base their self-esteem on how many hoops they can get the boy to jump through before going to bed with him.
JOANIE: So I guess what you should ask yourself is: How far are you willing to go?
NICK: All the way, Joanie. I'm willing to go all the way.

SHEENI: It's just. I don't think I could bear to be alone tonight.
SHEENI: Do you like it? I bought it in Santa Rosa last fall. I had hoped to wear it for Nick.
SHEENI: I like lying here with you, You do?
SHEENI: I can't think of anyone I'd rather lie here with.
