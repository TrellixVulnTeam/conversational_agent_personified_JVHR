CARL: I'm here, aren't I?
KATH: That's because it's New Year's Eve. You have to be here. Besides, it's not only social stuff. You used to have dreams. You wanted to go to business school, you wanted to work for the World Bank.
CARL: So I discovered b-school's not for me. People grow.
KATH: Growing is "X is not for me so I'll do Y." You went X is not for me and so I guess I'll sit on the couch for the rest of my life.

KATH: You shouldn't just understand. You should be mad. Or upset. Or sad. Or something.
CARL: We're at different places in our lives. I get it.
KATH: Your girlfriend of two years breaks up with you right before New Year's Eve and all you can say is "I get it?" It is completely within your right to call me a bitch.
CARL: That would be inappropriate.
KATH: ( tearing up ) I can't believe I've been dating someone so emotionless.
CARL: C'mere. It'll be OK.
PATRONS: Three, two, one. happy New Year!
CARL: Well, that was fantastic. Good night, guys.
PETER: You're going, already?

CARL: I see that happen like every night. Good night and Happy New Year.

CARL: ( clearly lying ) I'm out of town.
BANK CUSTOMER: Hey, I need to speak to a loan specialist and there's no one on the floor.
CARL: Sorry. Today I'm officially a But there's no one around.
BANK CUSTOMER: But there's no one around.
CARL: Someone might come. And if I'm not here, they won't be greeted.
BANK CUSTOMER: You're really not going to help me?
CARL: Until I'm relieved as a greeter, my hands are tied.
CHRIS PARKER: Hey, there. I'm Chris Parker. The new president of Southwest Bank. Just wanted to come by and personally introduce myself to every branch manager.
NORMAN: That would be me. Norman Calhoun.
CARL: I'm Carl Kendall. Just a teller.
CHRIS PARKER: I was "just a teller." And now I'm "just president of the largest bank in the Southwest." You need anything, you let corporate know. You hear?
NORMAN: Chris Parker and his HOT SECRETARY leaves. Carl watches them, clearly jealous.
CARL: ( clearly jealous ) Yeah, if you're into fake breasts and German engineering.

CARL: I'm in bed. Why? What happened? Did someone die?

CARL: TITLES UP: THE YES MAN
ALEX: Carl Kendall?
CARL: Alex Eberts? What's up, buddy?
ALEX: Too much! How've you been? I can't believe you're still working Where've you been? Norman's been heartbroken since you quit.
CARL: Where've you been? Norman's been heartbroken since you quit.
ALEX: Where've I been? You mean, where haven't I been? This year. Dude. I have lived. I climbed Mt. Kilmanjaro. I ate bat in Laos. I shot a cow with a bazooka. I'm not proud of that last one but I did it. How's the bank?
CARL: Same old same old.
ALEX: See? That's the problem. That's everyone's problem. You've got one life. Why waste it on the same old same old?
CARL: You kidding? Every day it's impossible not to throw rocks at the place.
ALEX: Alex starts WHIPPING rocks at the bank.
CARL: What're you doing! Stop that! I was kidding!
NORMAN: What do you think you're doing? Alex Eberts! Is this an alumnae prank? I love pranks!
ALEX: Hey, Norman!
NORMAN: ( into a walkie-talkie ) We have a situation.
ALEX: Go to the seminar, Carl! You won't be sorry!
MACHINE ): Carl, it's Peter. I know you don't do things anymore, but it'd mean a lot if you'd come by Rudy's tonight. Lucy and I are celebrating our engagement.
CARL: What are you doing here?
PETER: This is an intervention. You've missed your last event.
CARL: What're you talking about?
PETER: Our engagement party.
CARL: I'm sorry. I'm just really busy.
PETER: You're watching Hell's Kitchen. That's not even B-list reality TV.
CARL: So I don't want to go out tonight. Maybe I have to wake up early tomorrow. You don't know.
PETER: It's bigger than that. You and Kath broke up over a year ago and you still aren't dating anyone.
CARL: What? So? I'm like a sexual camel. I only need it once every couple years.
PETER: I don't mean to be harsh but everyone's moving forward. It's like you're still wearing a Timex while the rest of us each have entry level Rolexes.
CARL: You wear a Rolex?
PETER: Thanks for noticing. It's an Oyster Perpetual Yachtmaster. Sapphire crystal, self-winding. Four Gs. But that's not the point I'm trying to make.
CARL: So I don't have an oyster watch. All you and Lucy and Kath do is sit around and talk about real estate and Crate and Barrel.
PETER: What's wrong with Crate and Barrel? They have adorable stuff at reasonable prices.
CARL: Forget Crate and Barrel. Maybe I'm just getting more mature. I don't need the lifestyle ever night.
PETER: Lifestyle? You have to have a life to have a style of life. You never leave your apartment. You never meet anyone new.
CARL: I hate meeting people.
PETER: You've become a complete cave I am not a cave dweller. Just the other day, we all went to Summerfest and snuck backstage and you bet me I wouldn't steal something and so I stole a drumstick from that horrible Swedish hillbilly band. That's not very cave dweller of me.
CARL: I am not a cave dweller. Just the other day, we all went to Summerfest and snuck backstage and you bet me I wouldn't steal something and so I stole a drumstick from that horrible Swedish hillbilly band. That's not very cave dweller of me.
PETER: Just the other day? That was seven years ago.
CARL: But that's not possible I was already working at the bank by You had started there three years earlier. Why you've worked at that place for so long is beyond me. You had so much potential. You shouldn't be a teller. You should be the guy who tells the guy who tells the teller what to do.
PETER: You had started there three years earlier. Why you've worked at that place for so long is beyond me. You had so much potential. You shouldn't be a teller. You should be the guy who tells the guy who tells the teller what to do.
CARL: ( SHOCKED ) I've been a teller at Southwest Bank for ten years? How the hell did that happen? ( doing the math ) Ten years. if I had had a child, he'd be toilet-trained by now.
PETER: Actually, he'd be in fourth grade.
CARL: ( starting to panic ) I was making out with chicks by fourth grade. I was a little man by fourth grade.
CARL: ( SCOFFING ) Uh, yeah.
CARL: I don't know if I want that.
CARL: Cool. Do you want anything from the refreshment area?
CROWD: I am sorry, my friends. But I cannot hear you?
SANJI: I am sorry, my friends. But I cannot hear you?
CROWD: The crowd quiets.
SANJI: The crowd quiets.
SANJI: Come on up, Future Yes Man!
CARL: That's OK. I'm just auditing.
SANJI: You can't audit life! Now get on up here!
CARL: I'm cool right here.
SANJI: Then I will come to you!
CARL: Let me guess, Carl. This was not your idea to come here, Carl.
SANJI: Let me guess, Carl. This was not your idea to come here, Carl.
CARL: I wouldn't say that.
SANJI: You can tell me, Carl. We are all alone, Carl.
CARL: It wasn't exactly my idea.
SANJI: That's what I thought, Carl. And you think this is all bullshit, Carl, isn't that right, Carl?
CARL: Is there any other way?
SANJI: Is there any other way?
CARL: This whole thing seems retarded.
SANJI: But you are stuck in your life, Carl? Am I right?
CARL: I wouldn't necessarily
SANJI: You once had a dream? You wanted to own a boat? A house? A fancy car? You wanted to a doctor, a lawyer. a business man?
CARL: A little.
SANJI: It's odd that ten years can pass just like that.
CARL: It is.
SANJI: I want you to do something for me, Carl. Tomorrow, I want you only to say yes. Can you do that for me? For one day, Carl?
CARL: I'm not sure
SANJI: Please, Carl. Do it for me and you will be doing it for yourself. If you don't have the best day in ten years then I am the uncle of a monkey. Will you do it for me Carl? Just for a day?
CARL: Sanji grabs Carl hand and PULLS HIM to his feet. We PULL BACK and the crowd CHEERS.
SANJI: Welcome to the world of yes!
CARL: PETER ( V.O. ) ( on the phone )
CARL: Don't worry about it.
CARL: Oh, thanks for the invite, but.
SANJI: Will you do it for me Carl? Just for a day?
CARL: ( in slo-mo ) Excuse me?
PETER: Excuse me?
CARL: ( clearly not wanting to ) Yes. I will come to brunch.
KATH: ( AWKWARD ) Morning, Carl. This is a surprise.
CARL: Because I've never seen you at brunch. Like ever.
KATH: Because I've never seen you at brunch. Like ever.
CARL: You kidding? I love brunch.
CARL: Why do people wait an hour for breakfast? It's so hot and bright and we haven't even had coffee yet.
PETER: If you don't want to be here, you don't have to be.
CARL: Of course I want to be here. I love waiting an hour for eggs. It's fun. Although I will point out that you have sunglasses which is probably making this wait a lot Oakleys, polarized lenses, indestructible. Two fifty but worth every penny.
PETER: Oakleys, polarized lenses, indestructible. Two fifty but worth every penny.
WAITRESS: Lowell, party of five.
CARL: We were definitely before those Lowell people.
KATH: I hate when people jump ahead.
CARL: Why does no one ever say anything?

CARL: Yes. I will.
WAITRESS: No you weren't.
CARL: Yes, we were.
WAITRESS: I have the list, dude. The list doesn't lie.
CARL: Well, this time the list lied.

CARL: ( to the people who are You all know that we were up before you! And you have to live with that knowledge through your delightful brunch!
PETER: What's going on with you?
CARL: I just want transparency in terms of the brunch seating order.

LUCY: It's a two bedroom duplex with harbor views. It'd be perfect for you Kath.
KATH: Washer/Dryer in the building?
CARL: ( JEALOUS ) I didn't realize you were looking to buy a place. I thought you and I would be renters to the end.
PETER: She's a fancy lawyer making bank. It's about time she was buying.
KATH: ( PLAYFUL ) Shut up.
PETER: ( re: the menus ) What're you looking at?
CARL: Bacon and eggs.
KATH: How unadventurous.
CARL: I don't want an adventure first thing in the morning.

FRIENDS ): What would you all like to order?
WAITRESS: Would you like some pepper?
CARL: The Waitress starts grinding pepper onto Carl's meal. It's starting to take a long time. She's grinding and grinding and grinding.
WAITRESS: Would you like more?
CARL: She keeps grinding. A pile of pepper's growing on his food.
PETER: I don't think I've ever seen a waiter tap one of those pepper I'm just addicted to the stuff. Chinese cultures say it's good for You're all welcome to have some.
CARL: I'm just addicted to the stuff. Chinese cultures say it's good for You're all welcome to have some.
LUCY: That's. OK. Do you want a bite of mine?

BANK CUSTOMER: I want to refi my house and spend the capital on my personal business. I see you've got a 5.25 7 year ARM, but over at Chase they're offering 5.00 7 year ARM. Can you refi lower, like at 4.85 par example, or am I going to have to bring my beeswax elsewhere?

BANK CUSTOMER: ( NERVOUS ) So, what'd he say?
CARL: Do you maybe have any interest in borrowing ten thousand?

SANJI: Outstanding, Carl. Except for one
CARL: I just said I'm going to keep experiencing life. I thought you'd be happy.
SANJI: You're like a cigarette addict, Carl. Except you're addicted to boredom. On the way in here, Carl, I offered you a coffee and you refused. Perhaps that would have been the most delicious cup of coffee you would have ever had. Who's to say? Not you, Carl, because you said no! Anyone can quit smoking for a day. But for a lifetime? No.
CARL: So what should I do?
SANJI: Behold, Carl, the Maniyesto.
CARL: ( reading the document ) 1 ) Until New Year's Eve, I must say yes. 2 ) The yes cannot distort the ( EXPLAINING ) You cannot say "Yes, the world is flat" because that is an untruth.
SANJI: ( EXPLAINING ) You cannot say "Yes, the world is flat" because that is an untruth.
CARL: ( reading the document ) 3 ) If someone discovers you are a yes man, you do not have to say yes to them. 4 ) To avoid yes, you cannot avoid contact. Therefore, you must always answer your phone, the door, your postal mail, your email, etc and so on and so forth. 5 ) You must choose a yesponsor to keep you on the straight and ( to Sanji ) Who should that be?
SANJI: A close friend who will not tell a 5 ) I hereby void the "do you want" What is that?

CARL: I say. yes.
SANJI: And here.
CARL: Is this like a legal document?
SANJI: Kind of. And finally, my friend, please hold out your hand.
CARL: That should heal by New Year's. Until then, you are a Yes Man.
AHHHHHHHH!: That should heal by New Year's. Until then, you are a Yes Man.

PETER: For a whole year?
CARL: Yesterday I got promoted and beat up and hooked up with this chick and I have a massive headache today and I still might throw up, but I don't care because it was the best time I've had in like forever. Not to mention finding out that, despite what you might think, smoked whitefish in an omelette is delicious, even if covered in a thick layer of pepper.
PETER: But for a whole year?
CARL: You don't understand. I got promoted. Do you know how long I've been waiting for some kind of financial step forward? I said `yes' and it arrived.
PETER: Well, someone sounds like they're yuppifying their life.
CARL: Excuse me for wanting an appliance in my kitchen besides a hot pot.
PETER: There's no way you can do this for a whole year.
CARL: That's where you come in. You're my "Yesponsor."

CARL: ( dreading it ) I'd be happy to.
LUCY: I was kidding. Wedding showers are thrown by girls.
CARL: That's sexist. Please. I insist.
LUCY: Thanks. That means a lot to me.
ROONEY: That was some good times last night. You back for more?
CARL: I've got no cash. You mind spotting me and my buddies?

RENEE: But I can hit like way higher. Like check this out. I think this tone might be more appropriate for my water nymph song?

LEEORE: Um, excuse me, but we have to clear the stage.
RENEE: I gotta clear.
CARL: Sure. I love clearing stages.
RENEE: Well, thanks for coming, Carl. I must bid good night.
CARL: So early? It's only 8:00?
RENEE: I lead a jogging, photo group for people who want to both exercise and practice photography.
CARL: You're a photographer too?
RENEE: Amateur, but yeah. I show every If you want to do some artistic calisthenics join us tomorrow.
CARL: What time do you leave?
RENEE: Five. So we can see the sunrise.
CARL: Wow. I haven't seen the sunrise maybe ever.
RENEE: Oh, it's beautiful. Makes great photos. Nice meeting you, Carl.
FLIER GUY: You interested in learning Spanish?
CARL: Hey, Kath. Would you like one? I'm going to learn Swahili.
KATH: Maybe next week. There's someone you should probably meet. Carl, this is Seb.
CARL: Seb? What is that? Swedish?
SEB: Beat. Seb puts his hand on Kath's back. Carl notices this and is not particularly happy.
CARL: You're on a date then?
KATH: Yeah. Met him at my firm.
CARL: He's very tall.
KATH: I guess so, yeah.
CARL: Well, it was nice meeting you, Seb. So I'll be going.
SEB: Unless. you'd like to join us?
CARL: I'd love to. Join you guys.
KATH: INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - LATER Seb, Carl and Kath are sitting at dinner. It is incredibly awkward. Kath and Seb are clearly incredibly pissed off.
CARL: So, how did you guys meet?
KATH: I told you. Through the firm.
WAITER: Would you like to order some wine?
CARL: Oh, this is good.
SEB: Look, Carl, why don't you just eat your fish and fuck off?
CARL: Carl answers the phone.
CARL: ( while typing ) Dear Omar, While I appreciate the gravity of your situation, perhaps a goodwill branch is in order. Could you perhaps loan me a million and take it out of my final cut? Then I will happily send you my bank details. Sincerely, Carl.
CARL: Good morning.
RENEE: Wow. You look tired.
CARL: Well, it is five in the morning.
RENEE: Mammals are meant to be up at dawn. It's how we're built biologically. Where's your camera?
CARL: I thought I'd use my phone.
RENEE: Awesome idea. So light.
CARL: That's what I thought.
RENEE: Let's hit it.
RENEE: Alright! Enough standing around!
IRANIAN WOMAN: It was delightful meeting you, As it was meeting you Farinoush.
CARL: As it was meeting you Farinoush.
IRANIAN WOMAN: Although I must say I was surprised to discover that you are in no way Persian. Nor are you six foot two. You should change that on your Will do. Should I call you?
CARL: Will do. Should I call you?
IRANIAN WOMAN: Sorry, I want a tall guy.
LUCY: Who was that?
CARL: Farinoush Azzam. Great girl, but I don't think we're right for each How'd you meet?
LUCY: How'd you meet?
CARL: ( ignoring her odd look ) Let's talk wedding shower.
LUCY: So, I know it's just a wedding shower, so who cares really? And it's like so lame? But I've made an appointment at a stationery store. Are you going to totally kill me?
CARL: ( dripping with sarcasm ) You kidding? I love stationery.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: This one is nice. I especially love it in cream.
LUCY: Ooooh, pretty. What do you think?
CARL: Looks good to me.
LUCY: ( sarcastic annoyance ) Thanks for your opinion.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: It's always difficult to get the husband-to-be's opinion.
LUCY: ( derisive laughter ) I'm not marrying him.
CARL: I'm just helping throw the shower.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: Oh. What's the party going to be like? Sometimes it helps to know that before you pick an invitation.
LUCY: Nothing special. Just hors d'oeuvres and wine.
CARL: Look at this Bridal Bingo. What's Bridal Bingo?
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: It's bingo, except you yell out embarrassing facts about the bride and whoever fills their card first That sounds fun.
CARL: That sounds fun.
LUCY: I'm not doing Bridal Bingo.
CARL: How about a calendar shower?
LUCY: Can we concentrate at the task at Do you even know what a calendar shower is? Maybe a calendar shower is awesome.
CARL: Do you even know what a calendar shower is? Maybe a calendar shower is awesome.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: Every guest gets assigned a month and brings a gift that the bride and groom can use during that That's kind of cute.
LUCY: That's kind of cute.
CARL: I think that's really cute.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: The bride and groom ride in on a white stallion.
CARL: You have got to do that. Like it's not even a choice.
LUCY: That seems a little extreme.
CARL: You only get married once.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: Your friend happens to be right.
LUCY: You're really good at this. You mind helping me with the wedding
ARAB GUY: I love cell phones. I breathe cell phones. I own, myself, thirty-five cell phones. My brother is an idiot and he's selling cell phones hand over fist. What do you have? A Nokia 9850?
CARL: How much do you need?
ARAB GUY: Eighty five hundred.
CARL: Carl stamps his form.
JITTERY GUY: Just give me the cash.
CARL: You promise you'll pay it back?
JITTERY GUY: Carl stamps his form. Norman comes over.
NORMAN: May I speak to you, Carl?
NORMAN: I know what you're doing.
CARL: What am I doing?
NORMAN: You're loaning below our minimum.
CARL: I'm sorry, but it's absurd that if you need a small amount of money you have to go to a loan shark. Only rich people can pay back loans over ten grand. A bank's job is not to just help the rich. It's to help anyone with a dream achieve I know. These microloans are pretty interesting. So I'll you spearhead a little pilot program at the bank.
NORMAN: I know. These microloans are pretty interesting. So I'll you spearhead a little pilot program at the bank.
CARL: Thank you so much.
NORMAN: If corporate finds out, you're the one who's getting fired. So keep it quiet.
CARL: What do you need a loan for?
ROONEY: I don't. I was wondering if you were around tonight to help me Why don't you hire movers?
CARL: Why don't you hire movers?
ROONEY: Because it's cheaper to ask you.
ROONEY: Can you carry the fridge alone?
CARL: ( SCARED )
ROONEY: You OK?
CARL: Yes. Do you want to help at all?
ROONEY: I wish I could, but I hurt my back trying to move that fridge.
ROONEY'S MOM: I'm going to miss you, baby.
ROONEY: And I'm going to miss you, ma.
ROONEY'S MOM: I can't watch you go.
CARL: Where are you moving?
YES MONTAGE: Carl's taking Korean.
NORMAN: We need a volunteer to think up local marketing ideas
CARL: ( in Spanish ) [I like to drive with my mother.]
NORMAN: We need someone to be a weekend
TONY: Do you want to change your life through Mahayana Buddhism?
CARL: I'm kind of in a rush.
TONY: My place is right around the
TONY: It is only through the four noble truths and the destruction of desire that we can end suffering.
CARL: Well, that's really neat. So, thanks for the books and the jasmine tea and the vegan curry, but I have to go
TONY: Do you like Dionne Warwick?
CARL: It was really great meeting you
TONY: C'mon, Carl. Shake your groove
CARL: I really have to go.
TONY: Want to go into my bedroom?
CARL: ( very quiet )
CARL: Do you have any candles? I just love candles.
TONY: Tony instantly pulls out candles and lights them.
CARL: How about wine? Like a bottle of I only have Beaujolais Nouveau.
TONY: I only have Beaujolais Nouveau.
CARL: I have herpes.
TONY: Upstairs or downstairs?
CARL: Front door or back door?
TONY: Front door or back door?
CARL: It's a swinging door!
TONY: Just give it!
PETER: What's with the kitten?
CARL: I just adopted her. If you're interested, they're giving them away in front of Petco.
PETER: I don't want a kitten.
CARL: Neither did I.
PETER'S SECRETARY: Andy Solomon on line two.
PETER: Hey, asshole, we're not talking until you sign that goddamn
CARL: Seems like a nice guy.
PETER: She was upset you went on her date.
CARL: He asked me to join them.
PETER: I think you're taking this too far.
CARL: I have no choice. I'm a yes man. I must say yes. If Seb asks me to join them on their date, I must. If some dude asks me for a loan I have to give it to them even if it's clearly never going to be paid back. If a guy asks me into his bedroom, I must hook up with him.
PETER: You hooked up with a dude?
CARL: It's like hooking up with a strong woman. I honestly don't see what the big deal is. I am guided by yes. Yes has become my superpower. And let me tell, yes is turning out to be a pretty sweet deal. Now if you'll excuse me I'm late for Korean class.
PETER: You hate Korean food.
CARL: That's no reason to write off an entire, vibrant culture. See you later, buddy.
CARL: You really are displaying that.
RENEE: That's probably my best photo ever. My collages aren't bad. But personally, I think I excel at
CARL: Wow. That's really big. How do you have time for all this stuff?
RENEE: How do you have time to come to every one of my rocks shows even the one in Fairfield county that was seventy-five miles from here? I almost skipped that one.
CARL: You gave me the flier, so I had to At first I thought you were a weird stalker and I was scared. But now I think you're just a really shy dude with a crush. And while it's been suspenseful to see when/if you'd ask me out
RENEE: At first I thought you were a weird stalker and I was scared. But now I think you're just a really shy dude with a crush. And while it's been suspenseful to see when/if you'd ask me out
CARL: Do you want to go out sometime?
RENEE: Yes, I would.
CARL: By the way, I do other stuff besides follow you around.
RENEE: Like what?
CARL: I take Korean.
RENEE: In that case, what do you say we do
RENEE: Do you want any more squid hot pot? It's really good here.
CARL: I think I'm good. To have some
RENEE: What do you mean?
CARL: Like, do you want to open a store?
RENEE: Where I can sell my photos and pottery? Of course not. They're
CARL: They're not terrible.
RENEE: Yeah, they're awful.
CARL: I think you're being hard on I'm not asking for sympathy. My voice is way too high-pitched, my pottery looks like poo, and my photos are blurry and subjectless. But who gives a shit? Not everything needs a goal. The world is a playground. You know that as a kid but then somewhere along the way everyone forgets.
RENEE: I'm not asking for sympathy. My voice is way too high-pitched, my pottery looks like poo, and my photos are blurry and subjectless. But who gives a shit? Not everything needs a goal. The world is a playground. You know that as a kid but then somewhere along the way everyone forgets.
CARL: When? Like in a couple years?
RENEE: I bought a ticket for four months from now.
CARL: People always talk about that, but you're actually doing it.
RENEE: Honestly, I'm terrified.
CARL: It's lame, but you know, it's pretty funny. My boss Norman always throws theme parties.
RENEE: So if it's lame why do you work Because. it's actually not lame.
CARL: Because. it's actually not lame.
RENEE: What's that?
CARL: Like say you need three hundred bucks to pay for paint so you can start a house painting business. Rather than paying a loan shark who charges you 300%, now you can come to Southwest Bank. Whatever. It's kind of dorky.
RENEE: That actually sounds really cool.
CARL: ( in Korean, with
SUBTITLES ): [We are very fat. But can I please have this food made mobile?]
RENEE: So, what do you say we hit this crazy party?
CARL: Funny, not crazy. My boss is white White noise?
RENEE: White noise?
CARL: You know, like totally boring.
RENEE: I don't know anyone who's totally boring. Crack a person's shell there's always something creepy
NORMAN: Carl! Welcome. Or should I say, What's going on?
RENEE: What's going on?
CARL: I wouldn't bother.
NORMAN: You didn't tell her? This is a dress-up as your favorite character from Heroes. Do you watch?
RENEE: I currently don't have a
NORMAN: I don't know what to do with that information. There are drinks, chips, dips, various and sundry noshes. I entreat you to make friends. Let's get this party
CARL: We don't have to stay long.
RENEE: It's a party. Let's socialize.
CARL: I'm Carl. This is Renee.
KHATOON: Hey. I'm Khatoon.
CARL: I don't think so.
KHATOON: Are you listed on
CARL: So, how do you know Norman?
KHATOON: Karate Club.
NORMAN: Baked Lays people! It is on!
CARL: You're in a karate club?
PARTY GUESTS: Norman! Norman! Norman!
RENEE: ( whispering to Carl ) Told ya there was something weird under that white noise shell.
KHATOON: You're totally on persianwifefinder.com. SultanCarl.
CARL: ( changing the subject ) Khatoon, Norman! You guys should Well, isn't that cute? We've got a full match on. Hey, I'm Jason.
JASON: Well, isn't that cute? We've got a full match on. Hey, I'm Jason.
CARL: I'm Carl. What do you do?
JASON: Work for the INS.
CARL: I hate it. Everyday I have to dash some poor guy's dream. I'm a professional dream dasher.
JASON: I hate it. Everyday I have to dash some poor guy's dream. I'm a professional dream dasher.
CARL: It can't be that bad.
JASON: The other day, I turned down a guy who had literally been a professor at the University of Cuba.
CUBAN PROFESSOR: What? But I've already lived here for five years. I've received a steady paycheck and paid taxes for five years. I speak fluent English. I can't go back.
JASON: I'm sorry but no can do.
CUBAN PROFESSOR: I've passed the citizenship test ten times. I bet you couldn't pass that test.
JASON: You're probably right.
CUBAN PROFESSOR: Do you know the location of the Spanish-American war?
JASON: CUBAN PROFESSOR CUBAN PROFESSOR ( SARCASTIC ) CUBAN PROFESSOR
CUBAN PROFESSOR: CUBAN PROFESSOR ( SARCASTIC ) CUBAN PROFESSOR
JASON: CUBAN PROFESSOR ( SARCASTIC ) CUBAN PROFESSOR
CUBAN PROFESSOR: ( SARCASTIC ) You are an insult to your country.
JASON: ( SARCASTIC ) You are an insult to your country.
CUBAN PROFESSOR: You are an insult to your country.
CARL: So did you let him in?
JASON: I sent him back to Cuba. I send them all back.
CARL: If you hate your job so much, why do you do it?
JASON: Because I have to eat.
CARL: ( to himself, in wonder ) You're a no man.
JASON: Excuse me?
CARL: ( WHISPERING ) I'm not supposed to tell anyone this except for my Yesponsor, but you can change your life. I've changed mine. If I tell you how, will you promise not to tell ( sarcastically whispering
JASON: ( sarcastically whispering
BACK ): Yeah, sure, whatever.
CARL: I say yes. To everything. Say Yes More. It's that simple.
JASON: That's the most retarded idea I've ever heard.
RENEE: What did I miss?
CARL: ( THROWN ) Nothing. Do you want to go?
RENEE: You work for the ASPCA?
CARL: I just love pets. This is Veronica, King George, Owen, Carl jr., Carl the III, Carl IV, Bubbles, Greedo, Cat 1, Cat 2 and Cat 3. At the end there, I got kind of bored of naming them.
CARL: You don't need to do that.
RENEE: You have a lot of Mexican Viagra.
CARL: I have a congenital heart thing it helps. And it's cheaper than the stuff that's made here.
RENEE: You better not be a criminal. Because one time I dated this guy who jacked cars for a living and I did not enjoy living on the edge as much as I thought I would.
CARL: It's cheaper to buy in bulk. Is that a crime?
RENEE: A hundred boxes of Mexican prescription drugs borders on something vaguely criminal.
CARL: Carl grabs Renee and starts making out with her. They fall onto the bed. REVEAL Rooney watching them.
ROONEY: You must be Renee. I have heard so much about you. Can I watch?
RENEE: No, you can't watch.
RENEE: You know what I would love? A I give great massages.
CARL: I give great massages.
RENEE: Oooh. Yeah. Oooh, right there.
CARL: How much does a Schwinn cost?
LARGE MAN: Three hundred fifty three dollars. It'll really help me get my one hour delivery business off the ground. I've tried on foot. I only have a two mile radius.
CARL: Done and done.
NORMAN: Hey, the boys upstairs are here to speak with you.
CARL: Really? Because I have a thing at He asked for you specifically. Ixnay on the small loans-ay.
NORMAN: He asked for you specifically. Ixnay on the small loans-ay.
CHRIS PARKER: Carl Kendall? I'm Chris Parker. President of Southwest Bank.
CARL: I actually met you when I was just a teller.
CHRIS PARKER: ( no recollection of it at
ALL ): Of course! Pet-a-Puppy day. Free cookie day. Free half hour on the bank's punching bag day. You've upped walk-in traffic by 35%. Not only that you've also taken charge of corporate day care. I like a team
CARL: Thank you.
CHRIS PARKER: But then I got suspicious. What drives a man in his mid to late thirties who's still at the absolute lowest level of our corporate family? Generous helpfulness? Or raging revenge?
CARL: Generous helpfulness?
CHRIS PARKER: Which is when I got the numbers from your loan desk.
CARL: Uh huh.
CHRIS PARKER: You've given out over 682 below minimum loans. One of them was literally for fifteen dollars and eighty seven cents.
CARL: Janice Peabody's ant farm rental How do you explain yourself?
CHRIS PARKER: How do you explain yourself?
CARL: I've started a microloan project. I figure that if someone needs less than ten grand why should they go to a loan shark when they can come to a legitimate banking Because the paperwork makes any profit moot. Unless you're raiding our coffers.
CHRIS PARKER: Because the paperwork makes any profit moot. Unless you're raiding our coffers.
CARL: No. I wouldn't do that.
CHRIS PARKER: I would if I could, so why wouldn't
CARL: Thank you.
CHRIS PARKER: You're the kind of person we want in corporate. We're taking some clients on a golfing trip. You golf?
CARL: CHRIS PARKER
CHRIS PARKER: You free tomorrow?
CARL: CHRIS PARKER
CHRIS PARKER: Of course you are. I better watch my back around you, Carl Kendall. Soon you'll be taking my job. See you on the links.
LUCY: What happened?
CARL: I'm sorry bank meeting stuff.
LUCY: I've never heard of a Wedding Shower cake.
CARL: You have to have one. Modern Bride calls them a necessity.
LUCY: I'm sorry, it's just you've been so great at all this while my husband- to-be has been completely absent. Do you have time to grab a cup of
LUCY: Is he scared to get married? Is that why he doesn't care?
CARL: You know Peter. He's a man's man. He cares, he just doesn't know how to show it.
LUCY: You know how to show it. A wedding is a huge deal. I'm so scared.
CARL: You guys are perfect for each I know that and yet I'm still so Maybe if you're just honest with him about how you're feeling it'll be OK.
LUCY: I know that and yet I'm still so Maybe if you're just honest with him about how you're feeling it'll be OK.
CARL: Maybe if you're just honest with him about how you're feeling it'll be OK.
LUCY: He can be just so closed off.
CARL: Sorry, the bank, you know? The UFO conference is tonight? No, that's fine, I'll definitely be
LUCY: You've been so good to me. I've really come to depend on you. I want to pay you back.
CARL: Not necessary.
LUCY: Peter tells me you might have some disposable income these days.
CARL: For some reason, the bank keeps promoting me.
LUCY: If you want to look at some open houses, I'm happy to waive my fee.
LUCY: So this is at the very top end of what you could probably afford. Are you interested?
CARL: Are you sure? I mean, this is the first place you've looked
LUCY: Are you sure? I mean, this is the first place you've looked
CARL: Yes. I've got to run.
LUCY: I'm looking forward to meeting Renee tonight.
CARL: We're all having dinner. Tonight. Right. Of course.
LUCY: We're all having dinner. Tonight. Right. Of course.
CARL: Right. Of course.
CARL: ( on the phone ) I just think if we're going to be rolling out a no interest financing campaign we should commit hard.
NURSE: If you're interested in donating plasma, feel free to sign up.
WEIRD PROFESSOR: Between 1996 and 2000 England's Ministry of Defence paid security cleared experts to research UFOs. This classified study was code named Project Condign.
CARL: I'm sorry I'm late.
RENEE: That's fine. It's only the very first time I've met your friends.
CARL: It was work, it went crazy late.
RENEE: What's with the "They're Out There" and "I Gave" button?
CARL: Long story. Miss, could I have an orange juice? Like fast?
CARL: ( showing off, to Peter ) Your wife found me a really great place. Built in Bose surround sound, a 100 inch LCD flat screen TV, roof deck with jacuzzi.
LUCY: Least I could do. At least he's involved with our wedding.
PETER: ( ignoring Lucy's tone ) I likey your suit-ey. Hugo Boss?
CARL: Oh, this old thing? Prada, I You think? We went to three different Prada stores to find the right fit.
RENEE: You think? We went to three different Prada stores to find the right fit.
LUCY: What do yo do for a living, Renee?
RENEE: I paint. I'm in a band. I do volunteer work at a shelter. I teach ESL. I do balloon animal art. You know, a little of this, a little of that.
CARL: You should check out her pottery. It's really big.
RENEE: It is big. How about you guys?
LUCY: Real estate broker.
PETER: If you'll excuse me.
WAITER: Have you made a decision about the Well, we're kind of in a celebratory mood.
CARL: Well, we're kind of in a celebratory mood.
WAITER: In that case, may I suggest a 97 Petit Rothschild?
CARL: Maybe we should wait for Peter to He doesn't know crap about wine. Just pick one, Carl.
LUCY: He doesn't know crap about wine. Just pick one, Carl.
CARL: Why not? Let's celebrate.
WAITER: With six people, I'd recommend two
LUCY: Do you rent or own?
RENEE: I sublet. I have this corner of a It's a really nice corner though.
CARL: It's a really nice corner though.
LUCY: If you're ever interested in buying, you should ring me up.
RENEE: I hate owning things. Because when you own something, you suddenly are invested in that thing not breaking. And I break everything. I've gone through three TVS in three years.
SEB: How did you break them?
RENEE: I smashed one with a hammer, dropped one off my roof and the third one just went on the fritz. So I set it on fire.
CARL: It's on me! I'd like to split it between an Advanta Blue Business, Mastercard, a Diners Club and my South Dakota Bank Visa Check card.
PETER: Nice job with Renee. She's definitely odd, but that's not
CARL: I just spent $1500 on dinner.
PETER: What? Why?
CARL: Because the waiter asked me if I wanted the expensive wine and you weren't there to stop me!
PETER: Don't get mad at me about it. You can just stop.
CARL: No I can't. If I didn't say yes to the band flier, I never would have met Renee. If I hadn't said yes to taking charge of bank day care and then yes to becoming a loan specialist and then yes to the president's golf trip, I wouldn't be moving up. Each yes leads to the next one. If I stop, it could all fall apart.
PETER: You've gone from a passive guy who always said no to a passive guy who always says yes. Just saying yes is not a legitimate life I don't know why I should be taking advice from a guy who's wife is pissed he's not involved at all with the wedding planning.
CARL: I don't know why I should be taking advice from a guy who's wife is pissed he's not involved at all with the wedding planning.
PETER: I'm involved.
CARL: You told her you don't care whether the invite's cream or ivory.
PETER: I can't see the difference. Honestly, I'm terrified.
CARL: What? Why?
PETER: It's marriage, you know? The biggest thing ever.
CARL: But you guys have dated for years.
PETER: I know.
CARL: You're perfect for each other.
PETER: I know.
CARL: She's terrified too.
PETER: Of course she is. I think you'll both be a lot less terrified if you're terrified together.
CARL: Of course she is. I think you'll both be a lot less terrified if you're terrified together.
PETER: But what if I really can't tell the difference between ivory and cream? Does that make me a bad husband?
CARL: What matters is that you pretend you can see the difference.
GIRLS: ( high pitched goodbyes ) It was wonderful meeting you!/I loved it!/Let me know when you throw your next art thing!
RENEE: It was great meeting your friends.
CARL: They're a little stiff.
RENEE: They are a little stiff. What do you feel like doing?
CARL: I'm actually going rollerblading with Ralph.
RENEE: You know, crazy rollerblading guitar man.
CARL: You know, crazy rollerblading guitar man.
RENEE: The guy who plays at the promenade?
CARL: Any interest?
RENEE: No. It's ten on a Friday night. And that guy's crazy. Don't you want to go home and make out?
CARL: INT. CARL'S APARTMENT Carl and Renee are making while Carl surreptitiously checks his watch. Finally, Renee stops kissing him.
RENEE: ( ANNOYED ) Just go.
CARL: That is really good to know.
CARL: ( RELUCTANT )
CHRIS PARKER: What happened to you?
CARL: I do this whole Habitat for Humanity Thing.
CHRIS PARKER: I love the concept of charity. It's awesome.
CARL: ( in Korean, with
SUBTITLES ): [It is an honor to meet you. Do you like America?]
CHRIS PARKER: You speak Korean?
CARL: Just a little.
CHRIS PARKER: You sneaky devil. I knew I should watch my back around you.
CARL: Is it a problem if I've never played golf before?
CHRIS PARKER: You're a funny one, Carl Kendall. Remember, they have to win. In Asian cultures, there's a concept called Saving Face. You have to let them win. But if they smell for a second that you haven't tried your hardest, they'll commit hari Who knows? It's a delicate balance, Kendall. Like two little girls on a see saw with a crocodile beneath them. Make the wrong move, and the little girl will end up in the croc's maw.
CARL: CHRIS PARKER
CHRIS PARKER: Who knows? It's a delicate balance, Kendall. Like two little girls on a see saw with a crocodile beneath them. Make the wrong move, and the little girl will end up in the croc's maw.
CHRIS PARKER: Alright, buddy. It's all you.
CARL: I do.
SEUNG KIM: ( in Korean, to Carl ) [Good luck, my friend.]
CARL: ( in Korean ) [I shall need the luck. This is my first time playing.]
CHRIS PARKER: What was that?
CARL: Just keeping them on their toes. Reverse psychology. Tiger Woods does it.
CARL: Chris, you hit a 90. Nice one.
CHRIS PARKER: I bogied the fifth hole. I'm still pissed about that.
CARL: Joo-Chan hit a 95. Nice work. As for Seung Kim. You hit 453.
SEUNG KIM: Seung Kim pumps his fist.
CARL: I'm sorry to say that team Korean Bank International has won.
CARL: ( in Korean ) [I golf from crotch noodle.]
CARL: ( in Korean ) [I agree. The weather is sunny.]
CARL: ( NERVOUSLY )
CARL: You're very sexy.
CHRIS PARKER: I'm promoting you to bank manager. I've got my eye on you, boy. Don't you forget it.
RENEE: What's up, chicken butt?
CARL: I just got promoted to bank
RENEE: Renee kisses Carl.
CARL: Carl goes to grab some clay.
RENEE: I was kidding. Not as sexy as it seems. It gets in like everywhere. What should we do to celebrate?
CARL: Have dinner?
RENEE: How about Korean? Oh, no, you probably already had some today.
CARL: ( NERVOUSLY ) No, we just had American food, American fare.
RENEE: You've just been so busy it'd be fun to have a night just the two of us. I wish we could just go to the airport and hop on the first flight outta here.
CARL: INT. AIRPORT - TICKET COUNTER Renee and Carl are in line at the ticketing counter.
RENEE: ( with an English accent ) I think we're going to London.
CARL: ( with a Spanish accent ) Oaxaca, senorita.
RENEE: ( with a Russian accent ) Moscow, Russia, comrade.
CARL: ( with an unidentifiable
ACCENT ): What was that?
RENEE: What was that?
CARL: My Singaporean accent. Pretty good, right?
AIRLINE REP: Two tickets to. Lincoln, Nebraska. Have a good time.
