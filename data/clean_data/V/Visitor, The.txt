BARBARA: Oh. OK. Goodbye.
WALTER: Barbara walks out the door and then turns before Walter shuts
BARBARA: Mr. Vale? If I may ask, how many teachers have you had before me?
WALTER: Well, for what it's worth, it's difficult to learn an instrument at your age. Especially if you don't possess a natural gift for it. I'm not saying this to be mean. But if you do decide to give up then I would really like to buy your piano. It's a beautiful instrument.

WALTER: East Asia's experience is really the exception to the rule, because the conditions there that made trade liberalization for the Middle East successful weren't present in the developing countries in sub- Saharan Africa, and in Central and South America.
WALTER: Come in.
STUDENT: He sits down and sets a paper on the desk.
WALTER: Why is it late?
STUDENT: I had some personal things to deal
WALTER: I'm sorry. I can't accept it now.
STUDENT: I'm sorry.
WALTER: I'm sorry.
STUDENT: You know you still haven't given us a syllabus.
WALTER: ( Lying ) I know.
WALTER: The door opens and Walter's colleague, CHARLES VAN HORN steps
CHARLES: Hello Walter.
WALTER: I'm sorry to interrupt.
CHARLES: I'm sorry to interrupt.
WALTER: That's OK.
CHARLES: Walter, Shelley can't make it down to the NYU conference to present your paper. I'm going to need you to cover for her.
WALTER: Why can't she go?
CHARLES: She's been put on bed rest until she has the baby.
WALTER: Next week. We'll cover your class and make the arrangements.
CHARLES: Next week. We'll cover your class and make the arrangements.
WALTER: I wish I could, but now is not a very good time, Charles.
CHARLES: I understand but you co-authored the paper and the Dean wants it presented. He wants to keep Shelley on track for tenure.
WALTER: I just don't think I can with the start of classes and my book.
CHARLES: You're only teaching one class, So I can stay focused on my writing. I'd really rather not go right now.
WALTER: So I can stay focused on my writing. I'd really rather not go right now.
CHARLES: I'm sorry but there really isn't another option at this point.
WALTER: Charles, the truth is this is really Shelley's paper. I just agreed to co-author it because she asked me to. I'm not really prepared to present it.
CHARLES: That may be the case but you are the co-author and she can't go. Look Walter, you can take it up with the Dean if you want, but, as your friend, I wouldn't advise it. Not with that argument.
KAREN: Here you go, cutey.
WALTER: So I thought you forgot about me. Where've you been hiding?
KAREN: So I thought you forgot about me. Where've you been hiding?
WALTER: Just busy with work.
KAREN: Well you're never gonna make it on the wall with that excuse. I'm glad your back. Give a holler if you need anything. I'm just gabbing with one of my girlfriends.
WALTER: She walks back down the bar. Walter starts to eat.
KAREN: When are you going?
WALTER: Today after class.
KAREN: Sounds like fun. I'm gonna go have a cigarette. You want some coffee?
WALTER: Yeah. Thanks.
WALTER: He turns on the living room light and crosses to the kitchen table and sets the brown bag down. It's then that he notices some fresh flowers on the kitchen table. He looks slightly confused. He looks around the apartment. There is an UPRIGHT PIANO along one wall.
WALTER: It's OK. I'm not going.
AFRICAN WOMAN: Leave me alone! My boyfriend is coming home!
WALTER: I'm not going to hurt you.
AFRICAN WOMAN: Who are you? What are you doing in This is my apartment.

TAREK: ( to Walter ) Did you call the police?
WALTER: You didn't call the police?
TAREK: You didn't call the police?
WALTER: Tarek looks like he might belt Walter. Instead, he lets him go and quickly backs up. He paces while trying to gather his thoughts. Walter doesn't move. Zainab runs into the bedroom.
TAREK: And you don't know Ivan?
WALTER: I don't know Ivan. Who is he?
TAREK: He rented us this place. He said it belonged to his friend who was out of town.
WALTER: I don't know who he is but this is my apartment. I assure you.
TAREK: ZAINAB ( O.S. ) ( In French )

TAREK: Trust me. He's asleep.
ZAINAB: You don't know that.
TAREK: So let him hear. The guy probably needs some excitement.
ZAINAB: I think he's probably had enough for one night.
TAREK: I don't know. We'll figure it out tomorrow. Who knows? Maybe he'll let us stay. He's not really using the place.
ZAINAB: I don't want to be his roommate!
TAREK: OK. OK. So we'll figure it out in the morning. I promise, habibti.
ZAINAB: Zainab rolls over and straddles Tarek.

DARREN: ( To the waiter ) Hey man, could we get another order of this? ( To Walter and Tarek ) I love this food.

DARREN: That's not gonna happen.
TAREK: It's already happening. One day our kids will be going to China for jobs. Ask Walter.
DARREN: You think that's true?
WALTER: Well.if China continues to threaten the wage earners in the first-world economies by keeping wages down, then it's really just a matter of time. What they buy they inflate. What they sell they deflate. But then you have to ask the question `who's paying the cost?'. And the answer is the Chinese people.
TAREK: You see?
WALTER: Fine. Thanks.
TAREK: Cool. Guess what? I found an apartment in Brooklyn. We can move in on Monday.

MR. SHAH: When was that?
ZAINAB: Seven years ago.
MR. SHAH: And did they appeal it?
ZAINAB: I don't know.
WALTER: Why wouldn't they appeal it?
MR. SHAH: Fear of being deported. It used to be that when your asylum case was denied, they let you go until your appeal. A lot of people didn't bother with it. Getting denied once was enough to spook them.
WALTER: So what happens if that's the case?
MR. SHAH: Then there may be a final order of deportation on him which means he won't even go before a judge this time. He'll just be deported.
ZAINAB: They had to leave Syria! They had no choice!
MR. SHAH: Look, one step at a time. Let me talk to him then we'll have a better idea of his status and what our options are.

WALTER: Maybe you should call your mother. She might have.
TAREK: No. I don't want her to worry. I can handle this.
WALTER: Did he say anything else?

MOUNA: Walter shrugs.
MR. SHAH: And what happened after the We appealed. It took two years.
MOUNA: We appealed. It took two years.
MR. SHAH: And your appeal was denied?
MOUNA: MR. SHAH
MR. SHAH: Then they should have sent you a bag-and-baggage letter which basically tells you where to show up and be deported.
MOUNA: MR. SHAH
MR. SHAH: You sure?
MOUNA: Yes. I would remember this.
MR. SHAH: Did you move?
MOUNA: Yes. Eventually we had to. But we had our mail advanced.
MR. SHAH: Well, it wouldn't be the first time that happened. And pre 9/11 it wasn't much of a priority tracking people down.
WALTER: So if they didn't get the letter then does this help us?
MR. SHAH: It keeps our chances alive. If they got it and just ignored it then we couldn't push to reopen the case.
MOUNA: So you can help him?
MR. SHAH: It's still a long shot. Like I said, the Government's approach has changed radically.
MOUNA: MR. SHAH ( Without looking up )
MR. SHAH: ( Without looking up ) Relatively speaking. We just have to move quickly to get an emergency stay from the board of immigration. Then, we'll stick with the motion to reopen pending his green card
MOUNA: Can you explain what that means?
MR. SHAH: Actually, I don't have the time right now. I have to be in court very shortly
MOUNA: How long will he be in detention?
MR. SHAH: ( Without looking up ) I can't predict that. I'm sorry but I am gonna have to wrap this up.
MOUNA: Do you have children, Mr. Shah?
