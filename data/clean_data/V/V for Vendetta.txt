DASCOMBE: The time has come, London, to return to a bygone age, an age of tradition, an age of values that have been disparaged and all but forgotten. What this country needs is a leader! A true leader to remind us of that age. A righteous leader with the strength of his moral convictions to do what must be done. I give you that man! I give you our leader! Adam Susan!
LITTLE EVEY: Her bedroom door bursts open and a heavily armed soldier scoops her up.
MOTHER: My daughter! Don't take my Evey! Evey!
FATHER: Evey! Evey!
LITTLE EVEY: Mommy! Daddy!
EVEY: Excuse me? Uh. excuse me,
EVEY: Would you like. uh, would you like to sleep with me?
EVEY: I mean, for money.
MAN: That is the clumsiest bit of propositioning I've ever heard.
EVEY: Oh god, I'm sorry.
MAN: Is this your first time, darling?
EVEY: Yes, no, I mean for money. But I know what you want and I'll do it.
EVEY: Anything you want, mister. Please, I need the money. I know I'm young but I promise I know what I'm No. You don't know what you're
MAN: No. You don't know what you're
EVEY: Christ, you're a Fingerman.
FINGERMAN 1: Give the little lady a prize.
FINGERMAN 2: I've got something to give her.
FINGERMAN 1: Prostitution is a class H offense. Know what that means? It means that we get to exercise our own judicial discretion
FINGERMAN 2: And you get to swallow it.
EVEY: Oh god, please. It's my first time. Please don't hurt me.
FINGERMAN 1: Gosh, fellas, look at those big innocent eyes. What do you think?
FINGERMAN 3: Spare the rod, spoil the child.
EVEY: Oh no!
EVEY: Please, don't!
FINGERMAN 3: You heard the man, sweetie. This rod's for your own good.
V: "The multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him."
FINGERMAN 3: What the hell
V: "And fortune, on his damned quarrel, smiling, showed like a rebel's whore."
FINGERMAN 1: We're police officers, pal.
FINGERMAN 4: We're with the Finger.
FINGERMAN 3: So bugger off!
V: "Disdaining fortune with his brandished steel, which smoked with bloody execution."
FINGERMAN 1: He's got a knife!
FINGERMAN 3: Jesus Christ! Don't hurt me!
V: Good evening.
EVEY: Who Who are you?
V: Me? I imagine all manner of names shall be heaped upon my humble visage but, for now, let us simply say I am the villain.
V: And you would be?
EVEY: Of course.
V: Of course.
EVEY: Why did you do that? Why did you. help me?
V: Why indeed?
V: Almost time.
EVEY: For what?
V: For the music.
EVEY: Yes, music. My music. You see. Evey, I am a performer.
V: Yes, music. My music. You see. Evey, I am a performer.
EVEY: Is that why you're wearing a mask?
V: We all wear masks. Life creates them and forces us to find the one that fits. Do you know what day it Uh. November fourth.
EVEY: Uh. November fourth.
V: Not for long.
V: "Remember, remember, the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be
V: Tell me, Evey, what good is an actor that plays his part to an empty theatre?
EVEY: I don't know.
V: Nor do I. That's why you are here. I need you, Evey. I need someone to listen.
EVEY: To your music?
V: Yes. Yes, to my music.
V: Can you hear it? It's already
EVEY: I can't hear anything.
V: At first, you have to listen very
V: Ahh, yes. There it is. Beautiful, is it not?
EVEY: Oh my.
EVEY: It's beautiful.
V: Thank you.
LEADER: Gentlemen, I will hear your reports now. Mr. Heyer, speak for the Eye.
CONRAD: We have less than two minutes of usable footage, Leader. It took the suspect less than a minute to dispatch the Finger's vice patrol.
CONRAD: As you can see, the suspect's reflex speed is extraordinary. As is his strength.
LEADER: Freeze it!
CONRAD: I'm afraid the mask makes retinal identification impossible.
LEADER: Mr. Etheridge, report for the Ear!
ETHERIDGE: We were able to triangulate the origin of the fireworks. We also are currently monitoring a lot of phone surveillance indicating a high percentage of conversation concerned with the explosions. All suspect or significant transcripts are being forwarded to Mr. Almond.
LEADER: Very good. Mr. Finch, speak for the Nose.
FINCH: Thanks to Etheridge, we found the launch for the fireworks. These appear to be individually weighted flares and we have found traces of the same chemicals at both of the detonation sites which leads us to conclude that, despite a level of sophistication, these devices are all home-made with over the counter chemicals, making them impossible to trace. Whoever he is, Leader, he's good.
LEADER: Thank you for that professional
LEADER: Very good. Gentlemen, keep me informed of any further developments. England prevails.
LEADER: Mr. Almond, do you know what this is behind me?
ALMOND: Uh. the Fate computer system, No. No sir. It's more than that. This, this computer is a symbol, Mr. Almond. A symbol of the highest attainable goal of mankind. Do you know what that goal is, Mr.
LEADER: No. No sir. It's more than that. This, this computer is a symbol, Mr. Almond. A symbol of the highest attainable goal of mankind. Do you know what that goal is, Mr.
LEADER: Control, Mr. Almond! Control! The world around us is a changing, directionless, amoral morass and it is up to man and man alone to set things right!
LEADER: Without control, man is nothing more than any other stinking, sweating, brute animal. Control, Mr. Almond. The control that we have painstakingly built up over the last ten years. Now, do you understand what happened last We. lost control.
ALMOND: We. lost control.
LEADER: Yes, Mr. Almond. Last night someone did the unthinkable. Someone hurt us. It is imperative that we act swiftly and precisely. I want that man found, Mr. Almond. I want his head or, by god, I'll have yours.
EVEY: Wait. I've lost you.
V: No, you haven't.
EVEY: It is a labyrinth of interconnecting underground tunnels and The gallery is the main room as it is filled with an amazing collection of human culture. There is art that spans from the renaissance to the painted covers of Eerie comics, literature that ranges from Shakespeare to Spillane, philosophy from Plato to Bukowski, and a vast collection of There are movie posters everywhere and an entire wall is lined with videocassettes.
EVEY: A jukebox? Where did you get it?
V: I saved it. Like everything here.
EVEY: Oh, it's beautiful. I've never heard anything like it.
V: Of course not. You grew up in their world. Art is created by individuals and there are no individuals in a world where you are told what to think.
EVEY: This place is amazing.
V: You're welcome to stay.
EVEY: Stay here. with you?
V: Yes. If you like.
EVEY: I. I don't even know your name.
V: I don't have a name. But you can call me V.
EVEY: V? V. I like that.

The new day brings good news and bright prospects from overseas, where negotiations with New China are moving in a positive direction. Last night's scheduled demolition of two deteriorating landmarks went off without a hitch.
PROTHERO: Spokesman for the Interior ministry said both structures were severely damaged and judged to be a danger to the unsuspecting public. Plans for new landmarks are well
PROTHERO: Do you believe this crap, Dascombe?
DASCOMBE: It's not our job to believe it, Lewis. Our job is to tell the "Exactly what they tell us." I Know but do you think that people will believe it?

BODYGUARD 1: What the hell's that!
BODYGUARD 1: I thought I saw a man jumping onto the train.
BODYGUARD 2: The train's doing almost seventy. It would break his legs.
BODYGUARD 1: You're right, I. It must have been rags.

V: Commander Prothero.
V: That was your title at Larkhill. You remember Larkhill, don't you,
PROTHERO: I don't know what you're talking Maybe I can help your memory. Let's see. Larkhill opened in the summer of 2009. You were appointed it commander. You wore a uniform in those days. You looked very good in it.
V: Maybe I can help your memory. Let's see. Larkhill opened in the summer of 2009. You were appointed it commander. You wore a uniform in those days. You looked very good in it.

PROTHERO: INT. TRAIN CAR Prothero is terrified.
PROTHERO: You! You're him, aren't you?

PROTHERO: Oh no, no! Please I was just doing what I was told!
V: Of course you were. Now I'm telling you to make a choice. Either you stick that syringe into your neck or
V: I can kill you right now.
V: Crying doesn't help, Commander. I remember there was a woman who had been screaming for two days. You winked at the doctor and laughed, "All in the name of science."
PROTHERO: Please, don't make me do this.
V: It's a difficult choice, isn't it? Certain death versus something that might be. worse. But you never know. There is still a chance. You could survive. Look at me. Now, time's up, Commander. Choose.
PROTHERO: I'll see you in hell.
V: Yes. I'm quite sure you will.

DOMINIC: What do you make of this, Mr.
FINCH: Hmm. It's a rose. A violet carson, I believe. Strange.
DOMINIC: I didn't think they still existed.
FINCH: I didn't think they still existed.
SOLDIER: Mr. Finch! Sir!
SOLDIER: Sir, they want you at headquarters, Yes, sir. I'm to transport you Send the rose to the lab. Also, scrape a sample of this paint and have it analyzed as well. I'll be back as soon as I can.
FINCH: Yes, sir. I'm to transport you Send the rose to the lab. Also, scrape a sample of this paint and have it analyzed as well. I'll be back as soon as I can.
SOLDIER: Yes, sir. I'm to transport you Send the rose to the lab. Also, scrape a sample of this paint and have it analyzed as well. I'll be back as soon as I can.
FINCH: Send the rose to the lab. Also, scrape a sample of this paint and have it analyzed as well. I'll be back as soon as I can.
LEADER: Ah, Mr. Finch. I sent for you because what I have to say cannot be said over a phone or a radio. What I have to say cannot leave these four walls. Do I make myself Yes, sir.
FINCH: Yes, sir.
LEADER: I believe in a few things, Mr. Finch. I believe in god. I believe in the destiny of the Nordic race. And I believe in fascism. The romans invented fascism. They had a symbol for it; a bundle of twigs bound together. One twig could be broken but a bundle would prevail. That is the heart and soul of fascism. Strength in unity. I tell you these things knowing full well that they make you uncomfortable.
FINCH: Well, I.
LEADER: You have in fact expressed your discomfort in several arrest reports, arrests that were, in your opinion, "unnecessary." The fact that you are here, that you are not rotting in a prison cell, is a mark of my respect and admiration for you, for your craft, and for what you have done for this country.
LEADER: It is also because I know you, Finch. I know what you are. You're a man like me. A man who understands when they are given a job what must be done. I understand you, Finch, and that is why I can trust you.
LEADER: This terrorist knows us, Finch. These attacks are perfectly calculated and they are divisive. He knows what he's doing, Finch. He knows us all too well.
FINCH: You think he's an insider?
LEADER: What I think is that this man must be stopped. Stopped at all costs and no one, I repeat, no one is to be placed above suspicion. Do I make myself clear?
FINCH: England prevails, Mr. Finch.
LEADER: England prevails, Mr. Finch.
FINCH: England prevails.
EVEY: V, v, v, v, v.
V: I hear your summons, my lady. And

EVEY: I was reading the inscription. What is it?
V: A Latin quotation. A motto. "Vi veri veniversum vivus vici." "By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the
EVEY: Yes, I suppose you have. This place is the only universe I have right now.
V: Does that bother you?
EVEY: I don't know. I'm so grateful to you I just feel I should help you, you know, the way you're helping me. I mean, that's the deal, isn't it?
V: No deals, Evey. Not unless you want them.
EVEY: I think I do. Part of me wants to stay here forever and never have to face what's going on outside. But that's not right. Is it? That's not taking responsibility. Not conquering my universe.
EVEY: I want to help you, V. I want to do something. Can we make a deal?
V: Yes. I think we can make a deal if you like. I think I know a way you could help me very soon indeed.
EVEY: Good. That's that, then.
EVEY: V, you said that Latin thing was a quote. Who said it?
V: Nobody you'd have heard of. A German gentleman named Dr. John
V: He made a deal too.

DEREK: It's so good to see you. Since this bloody terrorist business, the old man has me literally chained to the office.

CONRAD: Well, we've been working some bugs out of the new Mark IX fiber optic network, actually
HELEN: Oh, Conrad, don't be such a bloody bore. Do tell us about the terrorist, Derek. Is it true he blew up Big Ben and the old Bailey?
DEREK: I'm afraid so. We're dealing with a pathological psychotic in the most extreme case. We'll catch him though. I promise.
HELEN: Oh, it sounds dreadfully exciting. Aren't you glad you've got such a ruthless, implacable brute for a husband, Rosemary?
ROSEMARY: Yes, well
HELEN: Believe me, you're lucky. You could be struck with a professional peeping tom like Conrad. England's highest paid voyeur, aren't you Helen, I think we'd better
CONRAD: Helen, I think we'd better
HELEN: Oh yes, of course. We have to get back so the little pervert can watch what the neighbors do after Sunday lunch. He's so exciting.
HELEN: Goodbye, Helen. Conrad.
DEREK: Goodbye, Helen. Conrad.

LILLIMAN: Ah, there they go. My happy and contented flock. Spiritually refreshed and ready to face the world again.
LILLIMAN: Did you enjoy the sermon today, Very inspiring, your grace. Though the segue of the forces of Satan among us did strike me as a bit of a curious digression.
DENNIS: Very inspiring, your grace. Though the segue of the forces of Satan among us did strike me as a bit of a curious digression.
LILLIMAN: Hmm, yes. A trifle purple, I thought. Still, Fate wanted it included and who are we to question the will of the almighty, miserable sinners that we are?
LILLIMAN: And speaking of sin, I wonder which of the seven deadlies the good lord will see fit to tempt me with
DENNIS: Perhaps pride, your grace.
LILLIMAN: I was thinking of something a little less ethereal. Has the young lady arrived?
DENNIS: The agency informed me she'll be here directly. However, there was a mixup. It's not one of the usual girls. She's a little older.
LILLIMAN: Oh dear. Oh dear. Not too old, I They promise me she's no more than Fifteen, hmm.
DENNIS: They promise me she's no more than Fifteen, hmm.
LILLIMAN: Fifteen, hmm.
LILLIMAN: Ah well, if Job could bear his disappointments, I suppose I must have the good grace to bear mine. Show her in when she arrives.
DENNIS: Yes, your grace.
DENNIS: The young lady, your grace.
LILLIMAN: Oh my!
LILLIMAN: And to think I doubted your loveliness for even an instant. Mea culpa, my child, mea culpa. You are a vision. An angel.
EVEY: Uh. thank you.
LILLIMAN: Of course, "hate the sin, love the sinner." I always say. Take your dress off, please.

V: Please allow me to introduce
V: I'm a man of wealth and taste.
LILLIMAN: Instantly, the point of one of V's knives is against the Bishop's throat. V presses a finger to his frozen smile.
V: Shh. It isn't polite to disturb the dead on their journey.
V: A courtesy I'll most respectfully extend to his grace.
EVEY: Lilliman swallows audibly.
V?: Lilliman swallows audibly.
EVEY: V, what are you doing?
V: Vi veri veniversum vivus vici,
EVEY: Oh no.
EVEY: You can't kill him!
V: Death has followed his grace the whole of his career. Is it any coincidence it has finally followed him here?
EVEY: Oh god, V. I can't I can't
V: Let us pray.

FINCH: INT. CONRAD HEYER'S BEDROOM Grunting like an animal, Derek's face is frozen, locked in the rigor of a violent orgasm. After a moment, he collapses beside Helen onto the sweat soaked sheets.
HELEN: There you go, baby. Now my baby boy can think so much clearer. Can't he?
HELEN: You have been thinking, haven't
HELEN: I know you have. Ever since this terrorist appeared.
HELEN: Oh jesus, that smile. That smile turns me on like nothing else.
HELEN: Tell me. Tell me what's going on in that ruthless sadistic brain of Everyone is so worried about the terrorist. Especially Susan. You know why? Because nobody knows what he's going to do.
DEREK: Everyone is so worried about the terrorist. Especially Susan. You know why? Because nobody knows what he's going to do.
DEREK: If I were him, I know what I'd do.
DEREK: I'd blow that fat bastard to kingdom come.
HELEN: No. You're kidding.
DEREK: Am I?
DEREK: There's an old train line under the New Government Building. It collapsed when they poured the foundation. You could haul in enough TNT to launch our Leader's ass all the way to the moon.
HELEN: You're serious, aren't you?
DEREK: You need to be careful, Helen. Your mouth is going to get you into trouble one day.
HELEN: Is that the same trouble you love putting in my mouth?
DEREK: You never know who might be I know, Derek. You love your country and you love your party, just like you love your wife.
HELEN: I know, Derek. You love your country and you love your party, just like you love your wife.
HELEN: Derek. I'm sorry. I know I can be a bitch. But that's why you're here, isn't it?
HELEN: This is it, isn't it, Derek? What we've been waiting for. At last, you'll be rid of Susan. I'll be rid of Conrad. And we'll be free. Free, won't we?
DOMINIC: Sorry it took so long. The boys had a devil of a time trying to filter out the background noise.
FINCH: Background noise?
DOMINIC: The perpetrator apparently turned on the Bishop's stereo. Subsequently, a great deal of the tape is useless.
FINCH: What music did he play?
DOMINIC: Beethoven. The fifth, I believe.
FINCH: Da, da, da, dum. That's code. Morse code.
DOMINIC: For the letter "V".
FINCH: For the letter "V".
FINCH: Anything on the girl yet?
DOMINIC: No. The agency said somebody claiming to be Lilliman's valet canceled his Sunday appointment.
FINCH: What is it?
DOMINIC: 23rd Psalm.
DOMINIC: It goes on like that for a while. Fairly incoherent except we could make out a few words in this part.

DELIA: He's incredibly powerful. This man's sternum was split like dry wood from the base all the way up to the manubrium.
DELIA: And he's resourceful. On that table behind you is a breakdown of all the chemicals found in Prothero's blood stream.
FINCH: Bloody hell.

FINCH: What about codename V?
DOMINIC: Most of Larkhill's records were destroyed for security reasons but I did uncover an old standard procedures and operations manual.

DELIA: I knew then that one day you'd come looking for me, that you'd find me.
DELIA: What what happened at Larkhill. What we did What I did. That terrible knowledge, it's been with me so long. That I could do things like that.
DELIA: For years, I blamed it on the government, on the authority I could never stand up to. But living so long with the knowledge of what I did has made me understand otherwise. I alone was

EVEY: I have to find someone.
CREEDY: Well I didn't like the looks of you All units, all units. Code red. Converge in Plaistow to apprehend codename V.
CREEDY: Bloody hell!
CREEDY: It's him! We got him!
DELIA: It's funny, I was given one of your roses today. I wasn't sure you were the terrorist until I saw it.
DELIA: What a strange coincidence. That I should be given it today.
V: There are no coincidences, Delia. Only the illusion of coincidence.
V: I have another rose. This one is for you.
DELIA: Then you are going to kill me now?
V: I killed you ten minutes ago. While you slept.
DELIA: Is there any pain?
V: No. No pain.
DELIA: Thank you.
DELIA: Can I Can I see your face again?
DELIA: It's beautiful.
DEREK: Don't move an inch, you bloody
DEREK: You didn't hear me arrive, did you? Didn't know we'd rumbled you?
DEREK: It's all finished, chummy. All of it. The old man told me it was my head or yours and what do you know. It's yours.
DEREK: Because you're standing over there with your bloody stupid knives and your fancy karate gimmicks
DEREK: And I've got a gun.
DEREK: Click. He never loaded it.
DEREK: Who Who are you?
V: Yes, look. Look and tell me what you see.
DEREK: Horrible! God, it's horrible!
FINCH: Inside, he finds her. Her eyes fixed, cold, and dead, a single violet carson in her lap.
FINCH: Get an ambulance.
EVEY: Oh no. V?
DOMINIC: I'm sorry, sir. You knew the doctor pretty well?
DOMINIC: We found this on her bureau, sir. It's Dr. Surridge's journal. It covers her years at Larkhill. It might contain the whole story.
PROTHERO: INT. LARKHILL OVENS - DAY - FLASHBACK Two inmate orderlies are hefting sacked cadavers from a cart into an incinerator.
DELIA: And napalm.
FINCH: That's the last entry until six months later when Dr. Surridge is back in London. There is no mention of the man in room five again. End of story.
FINCH: Except that it wasn't the end of the story.
FINCH: Between 2009 and 2012, over forty men and women who were previously stationed at Larkhill met with what were believed to be accidental deaths. Eventually, only three The three he'd been saving until
FINCH: The three he'd been saving until
FINCH: Everyone who worked at Larkhill. Everyone who could have identified him. You see there are two possible motives here. Not one.
FINCH: The first is revenge. He escapes from Larkhill and vows to get even with his tormentors. The whole exercise an elaborate, chilling That's the explanation that I find most reassuring, funnily enough. Because that means he's finished. It's over now.
FINCH: That's the explanation that I find most reassuring, funnily enough. Because that means he's finished. It's over now.
FINCH: The second motive is more sinister. Like I said, everyone who could have identified him is dead.
FINCH: What if he's just been clearing the
FINCH: What if he's planning something
FINCH: You see, the diary we found was in full view. We didn't have to search for it. He left it there. He wanted us to find it. He wanted us to know the story. Or.
FINCH: For all we know, the diary could be a complete and utter fake. Codename V could have written it
FINCH: He's playing games with us. He might never have been at Larkhill at all. Do you see? It could all be another smoke screen, a false trail, another cover story
LEADER: Susan punches the desk.
LEADER: Mr. Finch, would you please explain to me the nature of this meeting?! Because I was under the impression that you had some information about the terrorist, codename V!
LEADER: No more questions, understand! I want answers! I am not interested in where he grew up, what kind of flowers he likes or his favorite
LEADER: Do I make myself clear?
FINCH: Yes, Leader.
LEADER: Dismissed. England prevails, Mr.

EVEY: Please. I haven't done anything
ROSSITER: I said shut your hole!
INTERROGATOR: Do you know why you're here. Evey No, please, I didn't do anything.

INTERROGATOR: What is the identity of codename V?
EVEY: I don't know.
INTERROGATOR: You are a lying cunt.
EVEY: They were going to rape me, kill
ROSSITER: Shut up.
INTERROGATOR: This board will not tolerate any more of your lies, Miss Hammond. We have over 120 minutes of audio and videotape and 75 pages of testimonials from eye witness that identify you as an accomplice to the terrorist, codename V.
INTERROGATOR: Do you want to know why you're here? You are formally being brought up on charges of murder on fourteen counts and sedition against your Leader and country which brings an automatic sentence of death.
EVEY: Please. I didn't do anything.
INTERROGATOR: Process the prisoner and return her to her cell until she is more
INTERROGATOR: Rossiter wrenches back and Evey sucks hard for air, coughing out water.
INTERROGATOR: Now Miss Hammond, let us review the
INTERROGATOR: You work for codename V. Codename V killed Delia Surridge and then Derek Almond with your help and that is why you were found outside her home.
INTERROGATOR: Isn't that what happened, Miss No. No, that isn't true
EVEY: No. No, that isn't true
INTERROGATOR: Oh dear, Rossiter?
EVEY: No, wait!
INTERROGATOR: "My name is Evey Hammond. On the 5th of November 2019, I was abducted by the terrorist known as codename V and then taken against my will to an unknown location."
INTERROGATOR: "Once there, I was systematically brainwashed by means physical and psychological. I was frequently subjected to sexual abuse during this period."
INTERROGATOR: "Eventually I was terrorized into helping him commit the murders of Derek Almond, Dr. Delia Surridge, and Anthony Lilliman, Bishop of

EVEY: As you wish.
INTERROGATOR: As you wish.
INTERROGATOR: Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell, Rossiter, where she will wait while you arrange a wet detail of six men.
INTERROGATOR: Then take her out behind the chemical sheds and shoot her.
ROSSITER: It's time, unless you want to change your mind.
ROSSITER: Sign that statement. You could be out inside three years. Perhaps they'd find you a job with the
EVEY: Thank you but I'd rather die behind the chemical sheds.
ROSSITER: Then there's nothing left to threaten you with, is there? You are free.
EVEY: She listens as his footsteps fade down the hall, the door hanging weirdly open.

EVEY: Her mouth hangs open.
EVEY: You did this. to me.
EVEY: You did this to me!
EVEY: You You hit me and and cut my hair. It was you. It was just you all this time.
EVEY: You tortured me. You tortured me
EVEY: Oh god, why?
V: Because I love you, Evey. Because I wanted to set you free.
EVEY: A look of horror twists her starved face.
EVEY: Set me free? Don't you realize?
EVEY: Don't you realize what you did to me? You nearly drove me mad!
EVEY: I hate you.
EVEY: I hate you! Set me free? You put me in a prison to set me free?!
V: You were already in a prison. You've been in a prison all your Shut up! I don't want to hear it. I wasn't in a prison. I was happy! I was happy here
EVEY: Shut up! I don't want to hear it. I wasn't in a prison. I was happy! I was happy here
V: Happiness is the most insidious prison of all, Evey.
EVEY: That's warped! That's evil and it's wrong! What gives you the right to judge? Who are you to say what's not good enough?!
V: You were born in a prison, Evey. I didn't put you there. I just showed you the bars. You've been in a prison so long, you no longer believe there's an outside world.
EVEY: Shut up! You're mad! I don't want to hear it!
V: That's because you're afraid, Evey. You're afraid because you can feel freedom closing in on you. You're afraid because freedom is I can't feel anything! There's nothing left to feel! Don't you Don't back away from it, Evey. Part of you understands the truth even as part pretends not to.

V: You said you'd rather die. You faced the fear of your own death and you were calm. Try to feel now what you felt then.
EVEY: Oh god I felt
EVEY: Like an angel
EVEY: Oh god, V, I'm so scared. What's happening to me?
V: The door of the cage is open, Evey. All that you feel is the wind from outside. Don't be afraid.
V: Try to walk. The lift will take us to the roof.
EVEY: The roof? Outside?
EVEY: I I don't want to be No, Evey. No more blindfolds.
V: No, Evey. No more blindfolds.
V: Do you feel it?
EVEY: Everything's so different.
V: I know. Five years ago, I too stared beneath a night like this. Naked under a roaring sky.
V: The night is yours, Evey. Seize it. Encircle it within your arms.
V: Bury it in your heart up to the

V: EXT. NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING Finch gets out of a police car and looks up the black face of the modern building. He sighs and taps his pipe against the heel of his shoe.
DASCOMBE: Finch turns to find Dascombe hurrying towards him.
DASCOMBE: Do you know what this is all about?
FINCH: No, but I can guess.
DASCOMBE: "Remember, remember, the fifth of Oh come on. He's long gone. He has to be. He did what he came to do and it's over.
FINCH: "Remember, remember, the fifth of Oh come on. He's long gone. He has to be. He did what he came to do and it's over.
DASCOMBE: Oh come on. He's long gone. He has to be. He did what he came to do and it's over.
DASCOMBE: Isn't it?
FINCH: Not for us.
LEADER: I have given you almost a year and you have given me nothing.
DASCOMBE: Now Adam, there is no one better than Finch and you know it.
LEADER: Yes, Mr. Dascombe, I do know it. It is that very fact that keeps me awake at night, wondering if perhaps there is a reason that Mr. Finch has failed.
FINCH: What are you saying?
LEADER: I'm saying that perhaps I don't know you as well as I thought I Are you asking for my resignation?
FINCH: Are you asking for my resignation?
LEADER: No, I am asking for some goddamn It's not Finch's fault, Adam.
DASCOMBE: It's not Finch's fault, Adam.
CONRAD: We've all been looking. The man simply disappeared.
ETHERIDGE: He's gone, Adam. It's over.
DASCOMBE: He's gone, Adam. It's over.
LEADER: It's over, is it? He's gone. Vanished, you say?
LEADER: Transcripts recorded over the last thirty days in which the terrorist was talked about or mentioned in a positive context. This is only thirty days!
LEADER: Is this what you consider, For god's sake, Adam, it's a stupid variety show.
DASCOMBE: For god's sake, Adam, it's a stupid variety show.
LEADER: Mr. Creedy, I want the producers, writers, and actors of that "stupid variety show" arrested and charged with sedition.
CREEDY: Yes, sir.
DASCOMBE: You can't be serious
LEADER: Push me, Roger, push me and you'll find out how serious I am.
LEADER: This, this V is still out there. I can feel him like a sickness worming its way into the hearts and minds of the public. Something must be done, and done quickly, to exorcise this demon for the very soul of this country is at stake.
LEADER: That is why I am compelled to give each and every one of you notice that if by the fifth of November you are still giving me nothing more than excuses, I will have to revoke your party status and terminate your positions.
LEADER: Mr. Creedy, I will speak with you in private. The rest of you are dismissed. England prevails.
LEADER: Mr. Creedy, as the new head of the Finger, you are the most important member of my cabinet.
CREEDY: I, uh, appreciate your faith in me.
LEADER: Your predecessor, Mr. Almond, was a good man, a man who understood what strength in unity meant, a man who, above all, loved his country. I need to know if you are such a man.
LEADER: Do you love your country, Mr.
CREEDY: Oh god, yes!
HELEN: "The most important member of my cabinet." Yes it is, isn't it,
CREEDY: Oh, don't stop.
HELEN: I stop when you stop. What did he say next?
CREEDY: I can't
HELEN: Come on, Peter, what are you afraid of? Almond used to tell me everything and you're twice the man he was.
CREEDY: He asked me. if I loved my Oh yes, I can tell you do love your country, almost as much as you love
HELEN: Oh yes, I can tell you do love your country, almost as much as you love
CREEDY: Oh god.

CREEDY: Then he asked me to do something. oh, oh.
HELEN: Helen, I can't. I can't tell you.
CREEDY: Helen, I can't. I can't tell you.
HELEN: He told you to frame someone as the My god?! How did you know that?
CREEDY: My god?! How did you know that?
HELEN: I know Adam Susan. Now who was it?
CREEDY: No way. I can't tell you that.
HELEN: Yes you can, honey. You can and you will. You have to trust me, love. We're going to help each Helen, please.
CREEDY: Helen, please.
HELEN: Look at that face. You see? You're just bursting to tell me.
HELEN: Now who was it?
CREEDY: It was. Fi. Fi. FINCH!
EVEY: That was beautiful.
EVEY: I've wanted to do this for a long
EVEY: Thank you, V. Thank you for everything you've done for me.
V: You did it all yourself, Evey. I just provided the backdrop but the drama was all your own.
EVEY: It was a good backdrop. I believed it. I really did. It's still a bit hard for me to accept that it wasn't real. That it was just you. Especially the letter.
EVEY: It is a beautiful letter, V. Every time I read it I could feel Valerie, almost like she was holding me. I believed in her most of all. I believed that she loved me and I loved her back.
EVEY: I feel a bit foolish telling you this. I know that you must have written it and thought you should have it back.
V: But I didn't write that letter, Come with me.
EVEY: Come with me.
V: Come with me.
EVEY: Yes. Valerie Page. She was the woman in room four.
V: Yes. Valerie Page. She was the woman in room four.
EVEY: She's beautiful.
V: She wrote the letter just before she died. I delivered it to you as it was delivered to me. The words you wept over were the same words that transformed me.
EVEY: Roses. You grew them for her.
V: They're beautiful.
EVEY: They're beautiful.
V: Evey, do you know what day it is?
EVEY: Two days before the first day we You remembered.
V: You remembered.
EVEY: You're planning something, aren't you, V?
V: You know me too well now.
EVEY: What are you going to do?
V: I'm going to fulfill an old

EVEY: I've never been here before.

V: In a way, I suppose it really found
EVEY: What's in these packages?
V: She screams and almost drops one.
V: What are you going to do with all of it?
EVEY: What are you going to do with all of it?
V: I told you. I'm going to finish what was started four hundred years Where does this train go?
EVEY: Where does this train go?
V: This is the old Victoria line but it is blocked, blocked somewhere between Whitehall and St. James.
EVEY: Whitehall. V, that's the New Government Building.
EVEY: But the underground has been shut down for years. How are you going to make it run without any power?
V: I just thought I might ask them to turn it on for me.

GUARD: Fuck all.
DOMINIC: Creedy? What the hell's going on?
CREEDY: I'm here to arrest Mr. Finch for acts of treason and terrorism.
DOMINIC: You can't be serious.
CREEDY: If I were you, boy, I'd shut my hole unless you want to start explaining why you didn't say nothing about Mr. Finch's secret
FINCH: Why don't you just shoot me, Creedy? Wouldn't that make everything a lot simpler?
CREEDY: Yeah, I suppose it would.
DOMINIC: Holy Christ! Creedy, you stupid ape! If Finch is V then tell me who is that?

MOTHER: Hush. Turn it up.
V: They are afraid that I am going to say the things that are not supposed to be said. They are afraid that I am going to say the
V: The truth is that there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? If you look about, you witness cruelty, injustice and despotism. But what do you do about it? What can you
V: This is why they are afraid and the reason that I am here; to remind you that it is individuals who always hold the power. The real power. Individuals like me. And individuals like you.
V: I have come to offer you a deal. If you accept, I will give you a different world. A world without curfews, without soldiers and surveillance systems. A world that is not run by other men but that is run by you. I am offering you a second chance.

CAPTAIN: Sir, I think there has been a No! There is no mistake!
LEADER: No! There is no mistake!
CAPTAIN: But sir, there are people that say they saw both the terrorist and Dascombe together
LEADER: Who? Who are these people? They must be detained immediately. Whatever they saw or whatever they think they saw is subordinate to the truth and that truth is that Roger Dascombe is the terrorist and the terrorist is dead!
FINCH: But I thought I was the terrorist.
LEADER: Finch, what are you doing here?
FINCH: Since I'm not in jail and since you have another, even more convenient suspect. I'm guessing the charges have been dropped.
LEADER: Be careful, Finch.
FINCH: I am careful, sir. Always. That is why I suggest that a search of this building begin immediately.
LEADER: The terrorist is dead!
FINCH: With all due respect, I disagree and I believe that he is presently trying to get out of this building disguised as one of us.
LEADER: Are you challenging my authority?
FINCH: No sir, I'm trying to run an I am trying to run a country! When I tell you, Mr. Finch, the terrorist is dead, then the terrorist is dead! If you continue to suggest otherwise then you will leave me no choice but to have you arrested on charges of sedition. Do I make myself clear?

DOMINIC: Come on, Finch. We've seen it fifty times. I mean, after what they done to you, I don't know why we're even trying to stop him.
FINCH: I don't know. For twenty seven years, I've been at this job. Twenty seven years, I've done what I've been told to do. Maybe that's all there is to it. I'm just a dumb old dog. A dumb old dog that only knows one trick.
DOMINIC: That ain't it, Finch. It's more than that. I know you. It's something personal with this one.
FINCH: Maybe. And maybe I'm not ready for a revolution.
DOMINIC: Well, we got less than thirty hours to stop it.
FINCH: We will.
DOMINIC: It's on the tape. I know it. I can feel it. He did this for a reason. He needs something.

HELEN: Oh no! Not you. Conrad. Not yet. Here you can have a chocolate. Open up. Open!
HELEN: Good boy. As for the rest of the box, perhaps when you're Leader.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Ready in five, Leader.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: In four, three.
LEADER: Good evening London. As Leader of this great country, I felt it imperative to speak with you and to assure you once and for all that the shadow that recently fell across our land has indeed passed.
WOMAN: Oh, for fuck's sake.
LEADER: What we have endured this long year was no accident, no mere coincidence. This was not a simple act of terror conducted by a singular madman. No, this was a
LEADER: It was not me, nor the Party, nor the government that was threatened this year. It was our beliefs. Our faith. I believe that God himself bore witness to our struggle and like Job I believe that we have been vindicated.
DRUNK: Remember fifth of November!
LEADER: How do I know this? Let me read to you where I found the answer, where I so often find the answer. In the Scripture. Revelations.
EVEY: Oh, V, turn it off, please.
V: Of course, my dear.
EVEY: What is that, V?
V: That, Evey, is what I have been waiting for.
CREEDY: What about Conrad?
HELEN: I told you, I'll handle Conrad and V will take care of Susan. The mob will take care of the guard and then. You can use the Finger to take over.
CREEDY: Use the Finger? You mean like

DOMINIC: He's got us, doesn't he, Finch?
FINCH: Yes, he does.
HELEN: Now listen to me, Conrad. This is the most important moment of our lives. Everything I've worked and hoped for comes to this. Susan is a very dangerous man, especially now, that's why I need you, Conrad. I need you to be stronger than him. I need you to be the better man.
HELEN: If you do this Conrad, and you do it right, I'm going to turn you from the little man I married into the man of my dreams.

LEADER: Because I know who the terrorist
HELEN: Because I know who the terrorist
LEADER: Who? Who is it, woman?
HELEN: It's Conrad, Leader. Conrad. My husband is the terrorist.
LEADER: INT. LEADER'S OFFICE Conrad accesses the department of water and power. He finds the correct file and begins rerouting power to a once dead INT. V'S TRAIN STATION A hanging light suddenly sizzles to life. V looks up, INT. LEADER'S PRIVATE QUARTERS The Leader stares hard at Helen.
LEADER: How do you know?
HELEN: I saw him, Leader. In the middle of the night. I heard something. I went to the landing and that's when I saw it.
HELEN: That mask. That hideous smiling But how did you know it was Heyer?
LEADER: But how did you know it was Heyer?
HELEN: I know, Leader. I know the way a woman knows.
LEADER: But you have no proof?
HELEN: Yes, proof? This is an extremely delicate situation, Mrs. Heyer. It has been reported that the terrorist is dead. It would be a catastrophe to arrest a man now without concrete, conclusive proof. Do you have any evidence at all?
LEADER: Yes, proof? This is an extremely delicate situation, Mrs. Heyer. It has been reported that the terrorist is dead. It would be a catastrophe to arrest a man now without concrete, conclusive proof. Do you have any evidence at all?
LEADER: But if you're right, if Heyer is indeed the terrorist.
HELEN: Leader! Wait!
CONRAD: Is everything all right? Helen?
LEADER: Yes, Mr. Heyer, your wife has done her duty to her country.
LEADER: Don't worry, Mrs. Heyer. You will be taken care of. I will launch an immediate investigation and I promise, you will be the first to know when an arrest will be made.
CONRAD: Investigation of what?
LEADER: Subversion, Mr. Heyer. Your wife was privy to the dialogue of subversives. That's all you need to know at this time. Lieutenant!
LEADER: The Heyers are leaving. I need to see Mr. Creedy at once.
HELEN: Thank you, sir.
HELEN: I want you to go straight to your office and wait for me to call. When I do, I want you to come immediately home. Understood?
CONRAD: Yes, Helen.
HELEN: Oh, Conrad, I'm so proud of you.
CONRAD: I did it, Helen. I did it, didn't
I?: Tonight, Conrad.
HELEN: Tonight, Conrad.
CONRAD: I promise you will never forget
HELEN: I promise you will never forget
HELEN: Goodbye, Conrad.

FINCH: Leader, every second we delay.
LEADER: I'm coming with you.
GUARD: There will be no discussion
LEADER: There will be no discussion
GUARD: But if Mr. Finch is right
LEADER: I am sick to death of this terrorist being everywhere and nowhere! I will judge whether Mr. Finch is right and I will judge it with my own eyes! Do I make myself clear, Captain?
CAPTAIN: Sir, yes, sir!
LEADER: Is there a problem, Mr. Finch?
FINCH: No. no sir.
LEADER: Good. Captain, mobilize your men.
CAPTAIN: Sir, yes, sir.

EVEY: Evey smiles as V steps out of the shadows.
V?: Evey smiles as V steps out of the shadows.
V: Evey smiles as V steps out of the shadows.
EVEY: V, what's going to happen?
V: Change, Evey. That's all. Just Is it going to be violent?
EVEY: Is it going to be violent?
V: Yes, I suppose it will.
EVEY: But why? Why must is be violent?
V: Because, Evey, that is the nature of change. She is a temperamental creature that appears in earnest rarely but, when she does, she will wear one of two faces. The first face is the destroyer. It is lamentable but all true change begins with death.
EVEY: What is the other face, V?
V: The other face? She is the true face of change. The face of the creator. She is the one that remakes the world. Evey?
EVEY: Yes, V?
V: May I ask you for a favor?
EVEY: Of course.
V: It is a small thing but it would mean a great deal to me.
EVEY: Tell me.
V: I've never danced before. I've thought about it many times, here in this room, listening to the music. But I've always been alone.
EVEY: It would be my pleasure.
V: Thank you, Evey. You are an excellent dancer.
EVEY: All it takes is a little practice.
V: Alas, I have run out of time.
EVEY: V? What are you going to do?
V: Don't you remember? I have a date tonight, Evey.
EVEY: You're coming back though, aren't
EVEY: V, I won't let you leave unless you promise me that you will come back.
V: Of course, I'll be back. You don't think you can be rid of me now, do Just promise.
EVEY: Just promise.
V: I promise.
LEADER: Mark my words, Mr. Finch, this man is going to become an example so that every man, woman, and child in this country will remember what happens to those who would ever think to stand against the state.
LEADER: Captain, I need a gas unit down here with enough nerve gas to fill every rat-hole in these tunnels.
FINCH: I don't think that will be
LEADER: There are over one hundred of the best trained soldiers in this country down here. Let him come.
LEADER: Captain, what's happening?
CAPTAIN: They lost him.
FINCH: This. this is a mistake.
LEADER: Don't tell me you're a coward, Mr.
FINCH: Leader, we have to get out of here!
LEADER: This was your idea.
FINCH: It was a mistake. This is what he wants. He knows us, Leader. He knows us too well. We have to get out of here before it's too late
LEADER: What trick is this?
LEADER: This is an outrage! I order you not to listen to this!
LEADER: Captain, order all your men to fall back and secure this position!
CAPTAIN: Fall back. Fall back and secure the central platform.
LEADER: Any man that disobeys this order will be court marshaled!
LEADER: Captain! Captain, where are your Goddammit, I will not tolerate this insubordination! I want those deserters shot, Captain.
LEADER: Goddammit, I will not tolerate this insubordination! I want those deserters shot, Captain.
LEADER: Shot on sight!
CAPTAIN: You! You! Point position. We're getting out of here! Now!
LEADER: Traitors! You cowards!
LEADER: I know who you are! I'll see you hang! Every last one of you!
LEADER: Finch? Finch! Finch, goddammit, you can't leave me! Don't leave You are going to die as you ruled
V: You are going to die as you ruled
V: The smile is as cold and as sharp as the knife that flicks from his hand.
LEADER: Damn you! Damn you!
LEADER: Conrad? Is that you? You're working with Finch, aren't you? And Creedy! You're all in this
LEADER: Who are you?
V: You, most of all, should know, Leader. You created me. Without you, I would never be. More than life, Leader, you gave me purpose.
V: "He that killeth with the sword, shall be killed with the sword."
LEADER: Don't move!
FINCH: Don't move!
LEADER: Mr. Finch! Oh god, Mr. Finch!
FINCH: Drop the knife.
LEADER: Oh, I knew it, Mr. Finch. I knew you wouldn't desert me. You're a good man, Finch. A damn good man.
FINCH: No, Mr. Susan. No, I'm not. I'm a man who does his job and does what he's told. For twenty seven years, that's all I've been.
LEADER: Careful, Mr. Finch. He's quick as the devil.
FINCH: I've read Delia's diary over and over all year. It sickens me but I am unable to judge her. I am as guilty as she.
LEADER: Mr. Finch, what are you doing? Shoot him. Kill the bastard, I have no excuse. I did what I was told to do.
FINCH: I have no excuse. I did what I was told to do.
LEADER: Finch, I order you to shoot him! My job was to find you and catch you. I've done my job. I've done it for the last time. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of it all.
FINCH: My job was to find you and catch you. I've done my job. I've done it for the last time. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of it all.
FINCH: Kill him yourself if you can.
FINCH: Thank you, V. And goodbye.
V: Goodbye, Mr. Finch.
LEADER: I warned you, Finch, the penalty for treason is death.
LEADER: Are you ready to die?
V: The real question is, are you?
LEADER: Do you really believe you can pick up that knife before I pull this No. But I don't have to.
V: No. But I don't have to.
V: You see? You cannot kill me. There is no flesh and blood within this cloak to kill. There is only an idea.
V: And ideas are bulletproof.
HELEN: Creedy? Creedy, you dumb bastard, you left your car parked in front.
HELEN: What did I tell you? Creedy.
HELEN: Oh my god.
CONRAD: Conrad has propped himself against the bed.
HELEN: Conrad! What have you done?
CONRAD: I won, Helen. I did it. I won. I'm the better man.
CONRAD: We've been through a bad patch, Helen. But now, he's gone. There's nothing to come between
HELEN: Don't touch me! You stupid piece of shit! You've ruined it! I had it all planned perfectly and you've ruined it!
HELEN: I have to get out of here! I have to get away!
CONRAD: No! Let go! Now!
HELEN: No! Let go! Now!
HELEN: Conrad, damn you! Let me go!
CONRAD: No, Helen, you're not leaving me. not this time. not ever.
HELEN: No, please! Oh god, no! Oh god, please help me!
CONRAD: No one can help us, Helen. God is
EVEY: Scarlet footprints trail behind V as he struggles down the
V?: Scarlet footprints trail behind V as he struggles down the
EVEY: You came back.
EVEY: V! V!
EVEY: Oh god, what happened?
V: You need a doctor.
EVEY: You need a doctor.
V: It's too late for that.
EVEY: No, don't say that!
V: Evey, listen to me. I've not long and there are things that must be
V: I have done that which I came to do. Now, it is time for me to rest and with me the past will, at last, find peace.
V: But the world, the world is not saved. Do not think that, when the fires die and the smoke clears, there is no miracle. there is only a path. upon which they must learn to rule themselves.
EVEY: Yes, they need you, V.
V: Not me, Evey, not me. I told you I am the villain. The destroyer. But yes, they will need help.
V: I kept my promise to you, Evey. Now you must promise me.
EVEY: Promise me. you will discover the face under this mask. but you will never look beneath it.
V: Promise me. you will discover the face under this mask. but you will never look beneath it.
EVEY: I don't understand.
V: Promise me. Please.
EVEY: I promise.
V: Sweet Eve. Wherever I shall go, I shall always love you.
EVEY: V, you are not going anywhere!
V: Midnight. Midnight. Eve. Make them remember.

EVEY: Goodbye, my love.
EVEY: They will, my love. They will.
EVEY: I have come here tonight to keep a promise. A promise that is over four hundred years old. Tonight I am here to give you your freedom!
EVEY: Since mankind's dawn a handful of oppressors have accepted the responsibility over our lives, responsibility that we should have accepted ourselves. By doing so, they took our power. By doing nothing, we gave it away.
EVEY: Tonight, our world will change. Our leaders will be gone and we must choose what comes next. A return to the chains of others or lives of our own. A world of the past or one of the future.
EVEY: Let us choose carefully, London, and when we do, let us mark well and remember, remember this fifth of November!
EVEY: Yes, my love. Yes it is.
