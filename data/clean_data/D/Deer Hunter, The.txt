CREDITS ROLL: UNDER CREDITS we see STEELWORKERS catching the ingots with tongs and deftly swinging them into troughs. The STEELWORKERS wear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist. Warped in heat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figures in some hellish ballet. Since they all wear goggles it is hard to distinguish between them, but there are three, who are young, who seem to work with particular grace. These are NICK, SAL and MERLE. CREDITS END. CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, SAL AND MERLE. The noise is deafening, the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come on with murderous speed. Taking advantage of a slight pause MERLE jabs NICK and they both make cuckold's horns at SAL. SAL blushes and waves them off with his hand. MERLE and NICK make the horns again and now SAL puts both hands on his hips, gives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed. MERLE and NICK begin laughing. SAL can't hold out and he starts laughing too, but now the ingots begin roaring down the track again and they all grab their tongs.
SAL'S MOTHER: It's all ready? Everything's ready?
PRIEST: SAL'S MOTHER Are you sure everything's ready? Are you positive?
SAL'S MOTHER: Are you sure everything's ready? Are you positive?

SAL'S MOTHER: It would snow. Everything's going to slip. Everything's going to slide. All the cars are going to SAL'S MOTHER puts her hand to her mouth and bursts into I can't believe this. My own little boy. with a stranger! The PRIEST smiles. He takes SAL'S MOTHER in his arms and comforts her.

ALBERT: I'll get him. ALBERT wades back into the stream of STEELWORKERS, grabs VINCE and they all push out together.
VINCE: Snow. Holy shit, snow! SAL gives a look at the others. Something is going on. VINCE is so excited he begins hopping around.
SAL: What are you guys.? Are you guys going hunting? The others nod, shrug, shuffle their feet. They are all a little embarrassed.
NICK: As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
SAL: ( envious ) You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts.

NICK: ( with a laugh ) C'mon. C'mon you guys! They all start into the swirling snow. NICK with an arm around SAL.
VINCE: And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need
ALBERT: Yeah, Sal
MERLE: Willing fingers

VINCE: Hit it, Nick!
OTHERS: Go Nick! Hit it, baby!!!
NICK: Back! All hands to the rear! ALBERT and MERLE, who are sitting in front, immediately throw themselves into the back seat on top of SAL and VINCE.
ANGELA: ( sincerely ) I do. A pause. ANGELA scowls and tries it again.
LINDA: ( mumbles ) Go. fucking hell! LINDA reaches down, takes her FATHER by the shoulder and rolls him over. It takes some effort and the face that comes up is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter. Saliva dribbles from his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it seaming his forehead and as LINDA looks at him he begins cursing again.
FATHER: ( mumbles ) Go. fucking hell! LINDA reaches down, takes her FATHER by the shoulder and rolls him over. It takes some effort and the face that comes up is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter. Saliva dribbles from his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it seaming his forehead and as LINDA looks at him he begins cursing again.
LINDA: Daddy.! Daddy, it's me!
FATHER: Hate 'em. Fucking bitches! LINDA'S FATHER swings at her again, loses his balance and falls on the floor. LINDA stands looking at him, holding her jaw. She is crying. Tears are streaming down her face.
SAL: Boy, this is it. This is really it. I mean. here I go. SAL'S MOTHER hurries out of the alley. She is crying.
SAL'S MOTHER: My beautiful boy! My angel. who is leaving his own mother. She throws herself in SAL's arms, sobbing.
SAL: SAL'S MOTHER So cold is your heart to leave your own mother?
SAL'S MOTHER: So cold is your heart to leave your own mother?
SAL: Momma, I'll be right upstairs. SAL throws a look to NICK and MERLE. They gesture with sympathy and study the snow flakes.
SAL'S MOTHER: So cruel is your heart? Is your heart so uncaring?
SAL: ( a litany now ) One flight, Momma. It's one flight.
MERLE: ( indicates the waterproofing ) You should have put that on last I know.
NICK: I know.
MERLE: That way it sets.
NICK: I just wait. You know?

MERLE: You think about it?
NICK: So do I. I want to be ready. You have to be ready. It has to be there, in your mind.
MERLE: So do I. I want to be ready. You have to be ready. It has to be there, in your mind.

MERLE: ( firmly ) You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
NICK: ( uncertain ) Yeah. I guess.
MERLE: ( studies him ) What do you think about?
NICK: I don't know. I guess I think about the deer. Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
MERLE: ( with a glance to the window ) I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
NICK: ( laughs ) Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
MERLE: Who's a yo-yo.? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but. The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
NICK: ( laughs ) You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking ( he grins ) When it comes to hunting, that's Cursing and banging from outside. NICK opens the door. JOHN and ALBERT, both in tuxedoes and loaded down with gear, are pounding on the trunk of the Cadillac, trying to get it open. NICK and MERLE go out.

ALBERT: It won't open.
NICK: You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
ALBERT: Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
NICK: Here. Hit it here. ALBERT hits the trunk in the indicated spot and the lid snaps Hey, that's neat. NICK nods.
ALBERT: Hey, that's neat. NICK nods.
NICK: Couple of weeks. Listen
ALBERT: I love this car. Some cars sit, you know? This car, a car like this. grows. I mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has VINCE comes up, also in tuxedo, and dragging a totally disorganized clutter of hunting gear behind him.
VINCE: Hey, guys.
JOHN: Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville. ALBERT looks around at his friends. He surveys the back end of the Cadillac with simian pride. Then he expands his chest, thumps on it with both fists and yodels out a magnificent, mile-carrying Tarzan call. As the echo of it comes back the church bell begins ringing down the street and a group of excited BRIDESMAIDS come, hurrying up.
BRIDESMAID 1: Albert, what are you doing!
BRIDESMAID 2: Hurry up, you guys!
BRIDESMAID 3: Who's got their carnations?
BRIDESMAID 4: Here. They're right here.
BRIDESMAID 1: Look at you! You're all a mess!
BRIDESMAID 3: Put on their carnations!
BRIDESMAID 1: Who's got a pin? As the BRIDESMAIDS begin straightening ties and putting on carnations, NICK hears someone call his name. He turns to find LINDA standing beside the trailer where she can't be seen. She looks pale and very frightened and she holds a small suitcase in her hand.
NICK: ( crosses ) ( forces a smile ) Nick, your shoes are soaking.
LINDA: ( forces a smile ) Nick, your shoes are soaking.
NICK: Linda, what's the matter?
LINDA: ( tries to toss it off ) Oh. You know. She fights against it but the tears begin to come. NICK looks around, pulls her inside the trailer.
LINDA: ( with great effort ) I was just wondering. Nick. You're going hunting. If I could use this place to stay, because.
NICK: Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
LINDA: I'd want to pay you. and I was Linda. Hey, Linda.
NICK: ( kneels in front of her ) Linda. Hey, Linda.
LINDA: I would want to pay you, Nick. and I was thinking
NICK: Linda, Linda.!
LINDA: ( very small, looking into his eyes ) Will you marry me?
NICK: Will you marry me?
LINDA: ( after a long, long moment ) Would you? LINDA nods - a solemn nod.
NICK: Would you? LINDA nods - a solemn nod.
LINDA: Who else, dummy? NICK stares at her. He can still hardly believe it.
NICK: This is terrific.! This is really LINDA nods. She is suddenly excited, suddenly radiantly happy. She takes the suitcase off her lap and throws herself in NICK's arms.
LINDA: ( eyes closed, loving him ) I don't know! I don't know either!
PRIEST: "Blessed be the Kingdom. now and forever unto Ages and Ages. As the PRIEST continues with the Holy Sacrament CAMERA PICKS UP FACES IN THE CONGREGATION. We see SAL'S FAMILY. We see ANGELA'S FAMILY. We see the VETS from the V.F.W. Post. We see the STEELWORKERS from the bar and the WIVES and MOTHERS who chased them home to change. They are hard faces working class faces but we sense a fortitude among the congregation, a community of both heart and spirit. CAMERA PICKS UP NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN standing in a row opposite the BRIDESMAIDS. The guys all look slightly disheveled. Their tuxedos are all too small and their shoes are soaking wet from walking in the snow. NICK catches LINDA's eye and they hold each other across the intervening space like two children who are amazed. The PRIEST hands white tapers to the bride and groom. CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON THE PRIEST. The man is impressive gentle yet full of power. The PRIEST lights the tapers first ANGELA's, then SAL's and looks out across the assembled "For everyone that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds will be EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF THE HILL - NIGHT Save for a lone figure trudging home, the street is deserted, left to the gently falling snow. In the background the massive silhouette of the steel mill is plainly visible, lit with fire.
PRIEST: "For everyone that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds will be EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF THE HILL - NIGHT Save for a lone figure trudging home, the street is deserted, left to the gently falling snow. In the background the massive silhouette of the steel mill is plainly visible, lit with fire.
PRIEST: "The servant of God, Sal, is crowned for the servant of God Angela, in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen." Now ANGELA is crowned.
NICK: Sit with Linda, man, will ya?. Give her a beer. Would you like a beer?
LINDA: ( puzzled ) What kind of beer would you like?
NICK: What kind of beer would you like?
LINDA: ( laughing ) I don't know.
NICK: ( to Merle ) Give her Miller's. Miller's High NICK takes off. LINDA sits down at a table and MERLE goes to the cooler to get a Miller's. He gropes around in the tub, finds one and pops the tab. Suddenly he notices that NICK has crossed to the SAD-LOOKING GIRL by the wall. He has stopped in front of her and is asking her something. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL gives a blush, gets out of her chair and NICK takes her in his arms and begins to dance. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL looks transformed. She begins chattering and laughing. MERLE crosses back to LINDA and gives her the beer. As he pulls up a chair to sit down beside her he stumbles and nearly loses his balance. He is very drunk.
MERLE: ( laughs ) It's okay, Merle. NICK swings by with the SAD-LOOKING GIRL and waves.
LINDA: ( laughs ) It's okay, Merle. NICK swings by with the SAD-LOOKING GIRL and waves.
MERLE: ( catching Linda's expression ) I guess you like Nick.
LINDA: ( nods ) MERLE doesn't say anything for a moment. He seems to be trying to contain a floodtide of emotion.
MERLE: Fuckin' Nick. Fuckin' Nick. gives. Gives. Fuckin' Nick gives.
SERGEANT: The SERGEANT gives a beery chuckle and moves toward the dance INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLE AREA - NIGHT The SERGEANT passes between groups of celebrating GUESTS, plucks a beer from one of the coolers and sits down alone at the end of one of the white trestle tables.
GIRL: Albert, what are you doing. INT. V.F.W. POST DANCE FLOOR - ANOTHER LOCATION - NIGHT VINCE and JOHN are standing together. VINCE is going bananas because his girl, MARSHA, is dancing too close to FRED.
VINCE: Look at that, see. Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he. You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
JOHN: Oh, well.
VINCE: Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually. He did it again! That's what he's doing. He. He's reaching in, John, to her ! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now. VINCE marches up and taps FRED on the shoulder. FRED releases MARSHA. MARSHA waits, one hand on her hip, while the two of them exchange words. VINCE turns MARSHA, points to her ass. FRED turns MARSHA, pints to the small of her back. VINCE is hopping up and down now. So is FRED. MARSHA, who is getting bored, points to the door. VINCE and FRED bang out. As soon as they have gone MARSHA is taken by someone else who puts his hand right back where FRED had it.
MERLE: Nick, he just came back.
NICK: From Nam?
MERLE: Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son! MERLE gestures with his head. NICK and SAL cross with him to the SERGEANT.
SERGEANT: The SERGEANT keeps smiling.
MERLE: The SERGEANT keeps smiling.
NICK: MERLE nods.
MERLE: MERLE nods.
NICK: MERLE nods.
MERLE: MERLE nods.
SERGEANT: MERLE looks at NICK. NICK looks at SAL. They all begin scratching their heads, trying not to laugh.
MERLE: MERLE looks at NICK. NICK looks at SAL. They all begin scratching their heads, trying not to laugh.
SERGEANT: MERLE looks at NICK. NICK looks at SAL. They all begin scratching their heads, trying not to laugh.
MERLE: Well, thanks a lot. They turn away and then, when they are out of earshot, they all break up, howling.
SAL: Who the hell is he?
MERLE: Who the hell knows!
NICK: Is he from here?
MERLE: Hell no!
NICK: Well, where's he from?
MERLE: ( soberly ) Maybe he's lost.
MERLE: ( throws up his hands ) Well, I don't know!
VINCE: Bullshit! That's bullshit!
MERLE: You wanna bet?
VINCE: I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
MERLE: How much? How much do you wanna Bet him! Bet him, Vince!
OTHERS: Bet him! Bet him, Vince!
VINCE: I'll betcha! I'll betcha. I'll betcha twenty dollars!
NICK: Don't worry what it says in the Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
SAL: Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
NICK: Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
SAL: I'm gonna start slow. At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
NICK: Great. That's great.
SAL: That's my plan. NICK gives SAL a hug. SAL gets in the car.
NICK: See you Monday.
SAL: See you Monday.
SAL: All set, hon? ANGELA nods. SAL puts the car into gear and starts slowly off. Fists pound on the car. Rice and streamers shower down. Suddenly, through the front windshield, MERLE appears, stark naked, running in front of the car with colored paper streamers floating out from his upraised right hand. For a split second SAL cannot believe what he is seeing. He throws a look at ANGELA. ANGELA covers her mouth in amazement and then quickly shifts the hand to cover her eyes.
GUYS: Look at that! Fuckin' guy! Fuckin' Merle!. Unbelievable!
NICK: MERLE turns. His face has a strange, distant look, and he gives NICK an almost feral grin.
MERLE: You think we'll ever come back?
NICK: ( startled ) From Nam?
MERLE: NICK moves up beside him. He doesn't know what to say.
NICK: ( half laughing ) Promise! You gotta promise!
MERLE: Promise! You gotta promise!
NICK: You got it. MERLE lets out his breath. It is as if some great weight had been pressing on him.
MERLE: ( with a laugh ) Let's go huntin'. I mean let's do EXT. THRUWAY - NIGHT NICK'S battered old shark-finned Cadillac comes screaming INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN, all of them still in tuxedos, are jammed in the car between knapsacks, sleeping bags, six packs of beer and deer rifles.
GUYS: ( singing ) Let me be free! Let me be free! If. you. will let me be free. You'll. always be happy. with ( making a trumpet sound ) Wa-wa-wa!. Waaaaa!!!
ALBERT: ( making a trumpet sound ) Wa-wa-wa!. Waaaaa!!!
ALBERT: She fucked you?
JOHN: She fucked me.
ALBERT: She fucked me too.
JOHN: She fucked you?
ALBERT: She fucked me too. There is a long pause. They both struggle to keep their eyes She fucked us both.
JOHN: She fucked us both.
ALBERT: Fucking women, man.
JOHN: Fucking women, man.
ALBERT: ( shakes his head ) I know.
VINCE: Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
JOHN: Who's got the ammo?
ALBERT: Ammo! Get the ammo!
VINCE: I'll get it! Where is it?
JOHN: It's in the trunk!. It's in the trunk! I'm telling you, it's in the VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rush around to the trunk. ALBERT begins pounding on it.
VINCE: There, Albert! Hit it there! Pushing and shoving each other, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rush around to the side of the car. As they pass along the embankment at the side of the road there is a soft sound, like a sigh, and all three of them simultaneously vanish. NICK, who has been watching, stares at the place where his three friends disappeared. He takes a few steps forward, realizes what has happened and doubles up in the middle of the road, helpless with laughter.
VINCE: Get out of here, damn you! Go home!. Scat!. Shoo! VINCE, whose rifle is fully loaded, slams a shell into the chamber and lets off a barrage of shots above the deer.
ALBERT: Fuel up. Need fuel.
JOHN: Those are mine!
ALBERT: You want 'em?
JOHN: Damn right!
ALBERT: Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
MERLE: Here's a Hershey. ALBERT tears off the wrapper, dips it in the mustard and glomps it down.
JOHN: That's mustard!
ALBERT: ( mouth jammed full ) You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
JOHN: You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
ALBERT: ( nods ) Good. Pass the beer.
VINCE: ( pointing to a location beside the road ) Here, here! This is it!
MERLE: ( milk slopping over him ) Watch it, shithead!
VINCE: ( pounds Nick on the shoulder ) Here! This is it!
ALBERT: It is not!
VINCE: It is too! Now you passed it!
MERLE: It's ahead, by the tree.
NICK: It's ahead, Vince.
VINCE: That isn't it! There's no way that's it. Unless they changed it. They might have changed it. NICK pulls to a stop on the shoulder.
VINCE: This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
ALBERT: You're full of shit.
VINCE: Who's full of shit?
ALBERT: You're full of shit!
VINCE: I'm telling you, they changed it!
ALBERT: They did not!
VINCE: They did too!
ALBERT: Jesus, it's freezing! NICK, MERLE and JOHN have the trunk open and are taking stuff out. MERLE strips down where he stands and begins putting on his hunting clothes. ALBERT and VINCE grab their things and follow the example of NICK and JOHN, who are changing on the corner of the seats.
NICK: Holy shit!
ALBERT: Holy shit!
JOHN: Holy shit!
VINCE: Merle, hey Merle, you got any MERLE, who is crouched down studying the hillside, looks Never mind, Merle. Never mind, I got 'em. Where the hell are my pants? Anyone see my pants?. Who the hell took my pants! VINCE begins plunging around.
OTHERS: Fuckhead! Watch it!
VINCE: Somebody took my pants. I know I brought pants. VINCE tears into another pile of equipment, comes up with nothing and steps out of the car.
MERLE: Sure I got boots. I got boots right Then lemme have 'em.
VINCE: Then lemme have 'em.
MERLE: ( both hands in the air ) What do you mean, no???
VINCE: ( both hands in the air ) What do you mean, no???
MERLE: What do you mean, no???
VINCE: What do you mean, no???
MERLE: That's it. No. No way.
VINCE: Some fuckin' friend. You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
MERLE: You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here. You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
ALBERT: Merle, give him the boots.
MERLE: No. No boots. No nothin'.
VINCE: You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
MERLE: ( snapping it out, jabbing his finger at the ground ) This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
VINCE: You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!. I fixed you up a million times, Merle! I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up. and nothin' ever happens. Zilch! Zero!. The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
JOHN: Vince. Hey, you guys
VINCE: ( hopping now ) Take last night.! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
JOHN: JOHN throws up his hands in a comical way.
ALBERT: ( in agreement ) Get the boots.
JOHN: ( crossing to Merle's knapsack ) I mean let's get going before MERLE who has remained completely calm throughout VINCE's tirade pumps a shell in the chamber of his rifle. JOHN freezes in his tracks and stares at him, his face gone white.
MERLE: I said no. JOHN looks at ALBERT, who is right behind him, and they both back away. VINCE, who is standing directly opposite MERLE, begins to tremble. His mouth comes open, closes and comes open again. Urine begins trickling out from the bottom of his pants leg, staining the snow. Suddenly, NICK steps forward. He looks at MERLE, crosses to the knapsack, takes out the boots, walks over to VINCE and throws them on the road.
NICK: ( gently, to Merle ) Let's hunt.
MERLE: Hey, Nick?
NICK: Tomorrow I go with Vince.
MERLE: Tomorrow I go with Vince.
NICK: Hunt with Vince?
MERLE: Yeah. I mean so he knows. He doesn't even know.
ALBERT: Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
JOHN: Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
VINCE: Nothin' to it, asshole! Piece o' fuckin' cake! As the car ascends the grade the mill appears behind it, seeming to loom upward under the pink-streaked twilight sky. CAMERA HOLDS AS THE CAR COMES TOWARD IT. The headlights blaze white, like huge hungry stars, and the eyes of the dead deer on the fenders glitter gold and green and red. ALBERT leans out the window and gives his Tarzan call. IT
LIEUTENANT: What the hell are you doing here?
MERLE: ( numb ) Saving lives. MORE AMERICANS appear, some twenty of them, coming out of the trees in a long line. Among them are NICK and SAL.
LIEUTENANT: Move it out, girls! Move it out! The LIEUTENANT heads down the line. NICK stares at MERLE.
NICK: Merle?. Jesus, Merle! MERLE turns and looks at NICK. There is no recognition. He seems to be looking right through him. SAL comes up behind NICK.
SAL: Hey.! Hey, Merle! A shot rings out. The LIEUTENANT goes down and suddenly the whole line of AMERICANS is caught in a murderous cross-fire. Grenades rain out of the trees. MERLE, NICK and SAL dive for Out of the smoke V.C. SOLDIERS begin to appear, more and more of them, swarming out of the jungle in scores.
MERLE: You can do it, Sal.
SAL: No. No, no.
MERLE: Sal. listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
SAL: I want to go home, Merle.
MERLE: You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
SAL: ( tears again ) This is horrible!
MERLE: Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die. Sal, do you Merle, I wanna go home! There is an EXPLOSION from the other end of the room. SAL'S eyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering SCREAM. The GUARDS open a path and NICK appears. His knees won't support him and the GUARD who is holding him throws him on the floor.
SAL: ( nods ) Merle, I wanna go home! There is an EXPLOSION from the other end of the room. SAL'S eyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering SCREAM. The GUARDS open a path and NICK appears. His knees won't support him and the GUARD who is holding him throws him on the floor.
MERLE: Listen to me, Sal. Do it! You have to do it! The GUARD who delivered NICK jerks SAL to his feet and drags him of f to the table.
SAL: Hey, listen, you can do it. Believe me, you can do it. We can both do it. Then we go home, see? Then we go home! SAL looks down. The pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle comes up pointing at the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his eyes. The GUARDS begin yelling at him, urging him on and then SAL gives him a SMILE OF SUCH UNWAVERING FAITH that the SOUTH VIETNAMESE picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around, cocks it and puts it to his temple. For a moment SAL and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE look at each other. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE IS
MERLE: I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
NICK: What are you, God?
MERLE: Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
NICK: They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
MERLE: What are you, hoping?
NICK: What else?
MERLE: I thought you might be praying.
NICK: I'm doing that too.
MERLE: I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
NICK: What do you think?
MERLE: Nick, you're wasting your time. Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are. And we gotta get out!
NICK: You're right. Okay, you're right.
MERLE: ( grabs him ) Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
NICK: ( stands ) Okay, okay! ( he straightens his shoulders ) Okay. Okay, you're right. What about Sal?
MERLE: Forget Sal.
NICK: What do you mean?
MERLE: I mean forget Sal. Sal can't take it, Nick.
NICK: Forget Sal?
MERLE: Forget Sal. Listen to me forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
NICK: LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD A shout comes from the thatched hut. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE whip around in fright. MERLE and NICK turn. Through the bars of the "tiger cage" we see the V.C. GUARDS coming down from the thatched hut. The GUARDS are all drinking beer again and the GUARD IN CHARGE is waving the pearl-handled revolver. NICK looks at MERLE. The sight has totally unnerved him.
MERLE: LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD A shout comes from the thatched hut. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE whip around in fright. MERLE and NICK turn. Through the bars of the "tiger cage" we see the V.C. GUARDS coming down from the thatched hut. The GUARDS are all drinking beer again and the GUARD IN CHARGE is waving the pearl-handled revolver.

TOO!: A shout comes from the thatched hut. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE whip around in fright. MERLE and NICK turn. Through the bars of the "tiger cage" we see the V.C. GUARDS coming down from the thatched hut. The GUARDS are all drinking beer again and the GUARD IN CHARGE is waving the pearl-handled revolver. NICK looks at MERLE. The sight has totally unnerved him.
NICK: We what?
MERLE: We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
NICK: More bullets in the gun?
MERLE: ( even ) More bullets in the gun. The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
NICK: ( numb ) With more bullets?. Against each other?. Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
MERLE: Nick. NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got! NICK stares at MERLE. Rain is pouring off them in rivulets and the VOICES of the approaching GUARDS are getting louder.
NICK: How many bullets?
MERLE: ( watching him ) Three bullets minimum.
NICK: ( panic ) No way. No fucking way!
MERLE: ( evenly, holding him with his eyes ) I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
NICK: No. No way!
MERLE: When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
NICK: ( screaming )
CRAZY!!!: The GUARDS begin screaming orders from outside the cage and ONE OF THEM lets off a blast of automatic rifle fire which shreds the bamboo roof just above the PRISONERS' heads. NICK and MERLE grab SAL and drag him to the door.
MERLE: It's up to you, Nick. Now it's up to you.
MERLE: Him and me!!! Him and me!!! The GUARDS look at each other, interested.
MERLE: This is it, motherfuckers! Now he's going to do it! Watch! You watch! NICK almost loses what little control is left and his hand begins shaking violently.
MERLE: You guys think I'm in trouble, MERLE picks up the revolver, spins the cylinder, cocks it.
SAL: Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home? There is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible. MERLE throws himself on SAL, slamming one hand across his mouth and raising the other in case he has to silence NICK. For a moment there is nothing silence. The rain drones on and we can hear NICK'S breath, which comes in short, shallow The sound comes again and suddenly a PLATOON OF V.C. SOLDIERS appear, coming down through the trees. Their passage is almost completely silent and they go by on both sides, moving down the hill. CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON MERLE'S FACE. His gums are bleeding and his skin is drawn tight so that every bone stands out in his skull. His teeth are bared, his eyes are hollow and he looks within a hair's breadth of being completely mad.
SAL: ( a whisper ) Right here. SAL crouches down in the mud.
MERLE: ( a whisper ) Right here. SAL crouches down in the mud.
SAL: Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
MERLE: ( barely moving his lips ) Right here. Another explosion lights the sky, this one much closer. In the flash we see that a red American car is stranded in the middle of the road. There is another explosion and another flash. The car is dusty, spattered with mud, but otherwise it appears miraculously unharmed. NICK'S breath rattles in his throat. MERLE, who lies beside NICK, holding him, has closed his eyes. SAL, who is the only one who has seen the car, stares at it hard, and for a long time, trying it out with one eye and then the other.
SAL: No answer.
MERLE: Damn it!!! God damn it!!! MERLE looks down at SAL. SAL'S face in a mass of raw flesh but his eyes look up at MERLE with lunatic, unwavering trust.
SAL: Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
MERLE: ( nods ) Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
GENERAL: Where's your unit, soldier? MERLE stares at the GENERAL blankly, without comprehension. Finally, after a long moment, he gives a slight shrug.
GENERAL: ( to his DRIVER ) C'mon. We'll take him along. The GENERAL and the DRIVER get out and start up the embankment toward MERLE.
DRIVER: Uh-oh. Sir. The GENERAL looks up at MERLE. MERLE is holding the pearl handled revolver and he cocks the hammer with an audible The GENERAL and the DRIVER turn tail, scramble back down the embankment and pile in the jeep.
GENERAL: The GENERAL and the DRIVER turn tail, scramble back down the embankment and pile in the jeep.
DOCTOR: Is your name Solomon? NICK shakes his head.
NICK: ( mumbles ) You go ahead. CAMERA HOLDS ON NICK as he turns out of the line and heads for the exit under a long row of CLOCKS.
NICK: ( calling ) Sal.! Sal!!! NICK throws himself into the traffic, headlong, without even Vehicles swerve and screech to a stop. NICK dodges between them, gains the sidewalk on the other side and claps his hand on the back of a passing SOLDIER. The SOLDIER turns. It is not SAL at all and the resemblance is not even close.
NICK: I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
BAR GIRL: Everybody love Linda.
NICK: That's right. That's exactly what I I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
BAR GIRL: I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
NICK: Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda
BAR GIRL: ( in his ear ) How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
NICK: ( stares at her ) You mean.?
BAR GIRL: I show you. Come. You come. Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right? NICK nods. He looks as if he might be about to cry.
BAR GIRL: You like to call me Linda now?
NICK: Linda, yeah.
BAR GIRL: You call me Linda, just like home. Suddenly NICK draws to a stop, staring at a small window at the end of the corridor. He tears himself loose from the BAR GIRL and pushes up against the glass.
NICK: Hey. Hey, elephants! Look at those elephants! The BAR GIRL stares at him.
BAR GIRL: Wait! First I give you special Elephants! Make way. I gotta get EXT. NARROW STREET - NIGHT NICK paces up and down in front of the OLD MAN and his ceramic elephants.
NICK: Elephants! Make way. I gotta get EXT. NARROW STREET - NIGHT NICK paces up and down in front of the OLD MAN and his ceramic elephants.
NICK: Great. These are great. I wanna tell you these are great elephants! I'm going home, see. Stateside in a few days and my wife Linda, she loves elephants. She. she has a thing for elephants because elephants. Elephants go on. You know what I mean? They go right on. I don't know if they cry. Maybe at night. I mean. What I mean is my two best buddies are dead, see, MIA, who knows, and they would have liked some elephants also because. How much are these elephants? I mean let's talk
URCHINS ): Hey you guys.! Over here! Come over here and carry elephants! The STREET URCHINS come running. They are ragged, malnourished, ranging in age from about six to nine. They are covered with sores. One of them ~as lost an eye and another has lost a hand.
NICK: ( toneless, over and over ) Hey, hey, the wind does blow. Hey, hey, the snow does snow. Hey, hey, the rain does rain. NICK swallows, as if to force back some overwhelming emotion. Then, squatting down under a lamp post, he begins again.
NICK: I. No. You do this for money?
MAN: Mais certainment. A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the But I am always. how do you say. looking out for those who do. It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do. Where did you play?
NICK: Up north.
MAN: Ah yes. Of course. So few La creme de la creme. How did you obtain release?
NICK: ( raises his eyebrows ) We. Three bullets.
MAN: ( raises his eyebrows ) We. Three bullets.
NICK: We. Three bullets.
MAN: And then you. The MAN makes a clicking sound, three times, as if firing a pistol. NICK nods.
NICK: Nick. C'est extraordinaire! Do you know that I have a cousin who is called Nicholas and a nephew Nickolai. So you are, comme on dit, en famille. In the family. There is another SHOT from inside and another round of
ARMAND: Nick. C'est extraordinaire! Do you know that I have a cousin who is called Nicholas and a nephew Nickolai. So you are, comme on dit, en famille. In the family. There is another SHOT from inside and another round of
NICK: I have to go.
ARMAND: But you must come in.
NICK: No, I
ARMAND: But I insist.
NICK: I have to go.
ARMAND: You are frightened, no? NICK nods.
NICK: See, I'm going home.
ARMAND: Ah yes. Of course. To the girl who waits.
NICK: ( gives him a look and sits ) Yeah. Do you mind if I sit?
ARMAND: But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or ?
NICK: ( weary, shaking his head ) No. None of that.
ARMAND: Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know. ARMAND disappears in the darkness. Then his VOICE comes However, should you prefer German marks, or perhaps Swiss francs, this of course can be arranged. Everything can be arranged. ARMAND moves around the side of the building and the sound of his FOOTSTEPS fades away. The TWO BURLY MEN come lurching with another CORPSE. Laughter comes from inside the building and there is a glimpse of AN ELEGANTLY DRESSED WOMAN seated at a cafe table. The BURLY MEN return to the door and shut it tight. In the distance the sky goes up in a huge flash of fire and then the sound of the EXPLOSION rolls across the city like a great dead wind.
VETS: Three cheers for the red, white and This is hard.
VET #1: This is hard.
VETS: Three cheers for the red, white and INT. TAXICAB - DUSK NICK sits hunched forward in the back seat surrounded by unwrapped cartons containing electric appliances he has bought for LINDA. NICK looks nervous, VERY NERVOUS. Suddenly, as the cab comes over the crest of a hill, the trailer looms into sight, straight ahead, with VINCE hopping up and down in the snow and the OLD VETS all marking time under the flapping banner.
CAB DRIVER: Whadda welcome! Will you lookit. Whadda welcome! NICK stares at the approaching trailer.
NICK: That's not it.
CAB DRIVER: What're you, crazy? That's not it??? You said a trailer. You said
NICK: That's not it. Keep going. Go Hey, now listen. Now you said
CAB DRIVER: Hey, now listen. Now you said
NICK: I'm telling you that's not it! Now keep going! NICK throws himself down on the floor.
VINCE: This is him. I'm telling you, this is Nick! The TAXICAB comes thudding by. LINDA, VINCE and ALBERT all watch as it disappears over a rise.
ALBERT: ( to VINCE ) I thought that was it.
VINCE: So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
VINCE: ( to LINDA ) You okay? LINDA gives a thin smile.
ALBERT: Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
VINCE: It's gotta!
NICK: Guess who. LINDA stares at him. NICK gives a little laugh and steps in.
LINDA: ( throws herself in his arms ) Nick! Oh, Nick, you're back! She hugs him for a moment, as hard as she can, then they pull I thought. Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car. ( back in his arms ) I thought someone stole you away!
NICK: Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so! They pull apart.
LINDA: Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so! They pull apart.
NICK: Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
LINDA: Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!. Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
NICK: ( anger ) That was nothing. That wasn't It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
LINDA: It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
NICK: It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
LINDA: I made you a sweater. Here. You have to take that off. NICK removes his coat. LINDA pulls the sweater over him
NICK: How's the trailer?
LINDA: Great. Fine. Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
NICK: Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
LINDA: Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
NICK: Did you get hurt? You didn't get Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee. She begins to sob. CAMERA CLOSES ON HER FACE:
LINDA: Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee. She begins to sob. CAMERA CLOSES ON HER FACE:
NICK: It was all for nothing. Do you know that? It was all for nothing. LINDA stares at him. She doesn't know what to say, how to respond. NICK forces a grin, gestures with his hand and shrugs. He picks up the check, stands.
LINDA: Nick?. I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How. I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
NICK: Naw, it's. I mean.
LINDA: Maybe. I don't know, if you want to talk
NICK: Naw, it's. This guy wants his INT. SUPERMARKET - BACK ROOM - DAY The place is full of crates and boxes. ONE CREW is unloading a tractor-trailer. ANOTHER CREW is stacking and unpacking. NICK stands with LINDA and a red-faced, cigar-chewing MANAGER who is pumping NICK's hand, slapping him on the back and shouting orders all at the same time.
MANAGER: You did a good job, kid. Pettrucio, here! You did a good job. Gimme a count on these pears! I think we got 'em now, know what I mean? The pears, the pears! Ask me, we got 'em right by the balls, know what I mean? Have a cigar. The pears, Pettrucio, the pears!!! He goes off.
NICK: ( to Linda ) Does this. I mean, how does this job work out?
LINDA: Oh, it's great. Fine. NICK nods. A STOCK BOY comes by and whistles.
STOCK BOY: Hi you, hot lips.
NICK: What do they. bother you!?
LINDA: ( takes his arm, laughs ) I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
NICK: I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
LINDA: ( gently ) Nick. It's okay. It's okay. ( gives him a squeeze, kisses him ) I have to go now. NICK nods.
MANAGER: That's one sweet little piece of ass. I'm telling you, that's one sweet little piece of ass. Who's got these pears, God damn it! Who's got the count on these goddamn EXT. STEEL MILL PARKING LOT - DAY NICK stands by the entrance to the mill. It is cold and he looks as if he had been waiting for some time. Suddenly STEELWORKERS begin streaming out the doors, heading for their cars. NICK cranes his neck and then he catches sight of ALBERT and VINCE.
NICK: Hey, Albert! ALBERT turns. He grabs VINCE and pulls him through the departing STEELWORKERS.
VINCE: What the !
ALBERT: It's Nick!
VINCE: ( sees him ) Jesus, Nick! VINCE grabs NICK's hand, shakes it. Then ALBERT does the Where the hell were you? We were all set beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
ALBERT: I got delayed. I

ALBERT: Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
NICK: Tell him, Vince.
ALBERT: Tell him, Vince.
VINCE: Yeah. I did. Yeah.What the hell. VINCE makes a gesture, shrugs.
NICK: ( after a beat ) Well, who'd you get married to?
VINCE: Aw, it's a long story!
ALBERT: Tell him, Vince!
VINCE: Well. you remember Cynthia?
NICK: Cynthia! Sure.
VINCE: ( nods ) That's who.
NICK: ( fast recovery ) Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean. Great! That's really great!
ALBERT: Show him the gun. Hey, show him the gun, Vince. VINCE looks around. Cars are streaming out of the lot, horns blaring. VINCE pulls back his coat and shows a .38 Smith and Weston in a holster on his hip.
NICK: What the hell's that for?
VINCE: What's it for??
ALBERT: He's serious. Vince is fuckin' You mean.?
NICK: You mean.?
VINCE: Hey, Nick, I mean. This here is for the guy that gets caught!

JOHN: Nick! Hey, Nick! Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
NICK: Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
JOHN: Sit down. Here. Right here. Albert! Vince! JOHN pushes them all into a booth. A tray arrives loaded with beer and shots of whiskey.
ALBERT: Fuckin' A!
VINCE: ( stands ) Here's to Nick, you guys. He did his part. He did. what hadda be done. and so he did it. and here he is!!!
JOHN: Rough, huh?

JOHN: No. How's Angela? How's she taking Not so good.
NICK: No. How's Angela? How's she taking Not so good.
JOHN: Not so good.
NICK: Worse since she talked to him.
JOHN: Worse since she talked to him.
ALBERT: ( with a dull beery blink ) Fucking A.
NICK: Worse since she talked to who?
JOHN: Talked to Sal? Sal's alive?
NICK: Talked to Sal? Sal's alive?
JOHN: Kind of. You didn't know?
NICK: ( pushes off the counter ) Sal's alive??? JOHN, ALBERT and VINCE exchange glances, nod.
ALBERT: He's real bad, Nick.
NICK: ( stares at them ) Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here ( tears begin streaming down his face )
ALBERT: Hey, Nick.
VINCE: Hey, Nick.
JOHN: Nick, we don't know where Sal is. Nick, Angela won't tell us.
NICK: Why?. What do you mean?. Why???
JOHN: Nick, she won't say why.
NICK: But Sal's mother! What about Sal's She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
JOHN: She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
NICK: ( stares at them ) Oh, Jesus. He walks in a circle and then stops, staring at them.
SAL'S MOTHER: I know I know you. So familiar. Such a familiar face. Oh, I know now! The toaster man! I'll go and get it for you. SAL'S MOTHER goes out. ANGELA lights up a cigarette.
ANGELA: You're back.
NICK: I'm glad. Seriously. I'm very Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
ANGELA: I'm glad. Seriously. I'm very Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
NICK: Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
ANGELA: Sure. Why not.
NICK: Where? Where is he?
ANGELA: Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
NICK: You talk to him?
ANGELA: Oh, sure. Twice a day.
NICK: What hospital is he in? Where?
ANGELA: Nick. Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound. and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
NICK: Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
ANGELA: He doesn't want people bugging him, ANGELA begins to tremble, jabs out her cigarette and stands She stares at NICK for a moment, goes to a telephone pad and writes down a number in a tiny, nearly illegible scrawl. NICK comes up behind her. ANGELA finishes, puts down the pen and stands with her back against the wall. NICK tears off the piece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket.
NICK: ANGELA laughs and gives a strange, twisted smile, avoiding NICK's eyes.
ANGELA: Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
NICK: You know what Sal's got now?. Sal's got. one arm, Nick, and. that's it. The door to the kitchen bangs open and SAL'S MOTHER comes in with an electric toaster and a screwdriver.
ANGELA: You know what Sal's got now?. Sal's got. one arm, Nick, and. that's it. The door to the kitchen bangs open and SAL'S MOTHER comes in with an electric toaster and a screwdriver.
SAL'S MOTHER: Here. This is it. What you do, you stick this in here. Pushes the toaster in NICK's arms.
LINDA: It just seems sort of strange coming to a motel. Like a honeymoon. Or some kind of parlez vous . Not parlez-vous! What am I saying? That's those cocktails! Parlez-vous!. What I mean is rendezvous. Some kind of LINDA pulls on a short and very sexy nightie, then looks at herself in the mirror. She is very excited, very nervous. She strikes a pose, pulling up the bottom of the nightie and poking a finger in her mouth.
LINDA: NICK doesn't stir, doesn't budge. LINDA crosses and looks at him hungrily, top to bottom then she gives his toe a wistful shake.
VINCE: How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
NICK: ( forced enthusiasm ) Great. Feels great. Fuckin' A!
VINCE: I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean
NICK: ( shakes his head ) Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
VINCE: Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
NICK: Never one.
VINCE: Never one.
NICK: Never one.
VINCE: Oh, Jesus! You're kiddin'!
NICK: One, Vince. you have to understand, doing it with one. would be. like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
VINCE: Six or eight. And they go wild?
NICK: ( lowers his voice ) They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths. VINCE stares at NICK. His respiration is up, his mouth is bone dry and his eyes are as big as saucers. For a moment his belief is total, then a frown crosses his face.
VINCE: You're full of shit!
NICK: ( nods ) ( pounding him on the head ) And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta.! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?

JOHN: Yes, Albert?
ALBERT: ( into his ear ) John,we're going huntin'.
JOHN: Who's going?
ALBERT: We're all going.
JOHN: Nick's going?
ALBERT: Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
JOHN: No women?
OTHERS: No! No women! Jesus! What are you, Take these beers. They all take a beer. JOHN raises his glass, solemnly.
JOHN: Take these beers. They all take a beer. JOHN raises his glass, solemnly.
ALBERT: Hey! Fuckin' A!
VINCE: ( hopping up and down ) Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I In the timeless words of Squire VINCE cracks up, howling.
NICK: In the timeless words of Squire VINCE cracks up, howling.
VINCE: Squire Albert. VINCE collapses on the floor.
NICK: In the timeless words of Squire Hey! Fuckin' A!!!
ALL: ( in a ragged chorus ) Hey! Fuckin' A!!!
LINDA: Right here. LINDA crosses to the doorway.
NICK: Right here. LINDA crosses to the doorway.
LINDA: What are you doing?
NICK: Oh. Nothing. Sitting.
LINDA: You're going hunting?
NICK: ( blankly ) I see you're going hunting. NICK looks at the equipment on the floor.
LINDA: I see you're going hunting. NICK looks at the equipment on the floor.
NICK: Yeah. All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
LINDA: That's wonderful. I think you should. fresh air. NICK gets to his feet, suddenly. His face is twisted with pain and his voice is cracked with emotion.
NICK: You know how sometimes you're going along. You're going along. And that's all.! One thing is right after another, like steps. And you step along. NICK can hardly breathe. It is as if he were choking.
NICK: I gotta go. NICK swings his pack on his back, picks up his rifle and heads for the door. LINDA follows, still clutching her groceries, her emotions so pulverized she can't even speak.
VINCE: What are you, kiddin'? Are you kiddin' me, Albert? Twenty times I coulda had her! She.! One time she begged me, practically begged me. Listen, I had her tit, which was out, in one hand, and my other hand. You know that mole on the inside of her right leg? Well, I was past that mole, way past that mole, and I was JOHN nudges ALBERT. FOUR DEER are coming down the slope, single file. JOHN and ALBERT raise their rifles and FIRE. TWO OF THE DEER FALL AND THE REMAINING TAKE OFF. VINCE, who is just getting to his feet, unslings his rifle, trips and falls down. JOHN and ALBERT drag VINCE to his feet and then rush over to the TWO DEAD DEER.
JOHN: Psst. Vince! JOHN signals with his head. VINCE turns. ANOTHER DEER has come out of the woods. The DEER is rattled by the gunfire and peers at VINCE uncertainly. VINCE spins and grabs his gun, which immediately goes off. He slams another shell in the chamber and scrambles to his feet but the rifle sling is hooked on the antlers of the DEAD DEER and another shot ricochets off a nearby rock. JOHN and ALBERT dive for cover. As they look up, they see the DEER trot down the slope and then VINCE, firing wildly, running after it.
JOHN: Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
ALBERT: Hey! Fuckin' A! Just. just like a hot shit. except cold. JOHN lowers his beer. ALBERT gives him a blank expression, then cracks up. SHOTS explode nearby. At first the shots are scattered but they quickly open into a FULL BARRAGE. ALBERT and JOHN stand up.
VINCE: I got this one!!! This one's VINCE loses his footing and rolls down the embankment, head over heels.
VINCE: I got this one!!! This one's The panicked DEER bolts down the highway between the parked cars. The HUNTERS ON THE EMBANKMENT open fire. The HUNTERS IN THE CARS dive for cover.
VINCE: Gun! Gimme gun!!! ALBERT indicates his rifle. VINCE stumbles over to it, rams a cartridge in the chamber.
JOHN: Inside, Vince. VINCE staggers to the cabin door. The DEER is lying on the floor, motionless, DEAD.
VINCE: I got it! Hey, you guys, I got EXT. MOUNTAINS - FROZEN LAKE - DAY The wind is blowing in gusts, slanting the snow first one way and then the other. NICK appears in the distance, a black speck in the endless expanse of shifting white. As NICK draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion. His clothes are , caked with snow, his breath comes in a shallow gasp and his gait is uneven, favoring one leg. As NICK APPROACHES CAMERA HE FALTERS AND LIMPS TO A STOP. There are no tracks. There is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in the driving snow. The wind bangs in from one way, then it shifts and bangs in again from another way. Suddenly it stops entirely. In the silence there is a sound the click of a hoof on rock. NICK turns. The BUCK is standing on the shoreline, not thirty feet away, looking down at him. NICK pushes himself to his feet, raises his rifle and sights down the barrel.
NICK: ( grins ) Damn. God damn.
NICK: ( shouts ) Hey! Hey. okay!
ALBERT: You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
VINCE: Who? Who is?
ALBERT: You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!. I mean, what do you know?
VINCE: I know! I fuckin' know!
ALBERT: You don't!
VINCE: I do!!!
ALBERT: I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
VINCE: She does not!
ALBERT: Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
VINCE: In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
ALBERT: In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
VINCE: She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
ALBERT: She does, Vince! That's what I'm telling you! She does!!! VINCE is sheet-white, trembling. He grabs up the pistol and cocks it.
VINCE: ( shrieking ) Say that one more time!. Say it!!! Go on, say it!!! NICK is half-way up the wall, still half-asleep, staring at the pistol in disbelief. Suddenly he springs, seizes the gun with one hand and slams VINCE to the floor. VINCE gets up. NICK slugs him in the face, knees him in the stomach and begins pounding his head against the wall. ALBERT lurches over, pulls NICK away.
ALBERT: Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!. Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
NICK: ( grimly ) VINCE gets to his feet. Blood is streaming down his face.
VINCE: What the hell was that! What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
NICK: You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
VINCE: The fuck I did!!!
NICK: The fuck you didn't!. Gimme that! NICK takes the pistol.
VINCE: What do you think? You think I don't know!!! NICK looks at him, then he EMPTIES THE PISTOL INTO THE FLOOR. For a moment there is absolute silence. The wind moans in the trees, snow curls through the open door and JOHN, who is still soundly sleeping, finds a new note on which to snore. NICK looks down at the pistol, turns it over in his hands.
NICK: I'm going to throw this fuckin' thing away. NICK goes out.
SAL: INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT NICK sits in a little chair by the window, still in his hunting clothes, huddled anxiously over the receiver.
NICK: Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
SAL: Nick. Hey. How's things?
NICK: Oh. You know. How's it with you?
SAL: Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
NICK: ( he can hardly hear ) What's that noise?
SAL: What's that noise?
NICK: What's that noise?
SAL: John Wayne. Listen, Nick
NICK: Great. Hey. That's great.
SAL: Listen, Nick
NICK: John Wayne's great. Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
SAL: I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
NICK: ( hearing it ) ( with everything he has ) Place is great. Really. One great place. Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean

NICK: Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can I gotta get back, Nick. SAL looks around in desperation.
SAL: I gotta get back, Nick. SAL looks around in desperation.
NICK: Sal?. Sal?
CHECKER: She's in back.
NICK: How was huntin'?
CHECKER: How was huntin'?
NICK: Oh. Fine.
CHECKER: Get anything?
NICK: Too bad. NICK goes down a long aisle of bright packages. Coming out at the back he finds LINDA sitting in a green plastic chair, Linda. Honey, what's wrong?
CHECKER: Too bad. NICK goes down a long aisle of bright packages. Coming out at the back he finds LINDA sitting in a green plastic chair, Linda. Honey, what's wrong?
NICK: Linda. Honey, what's wrong?
LINDA: ( helpless shrug ) I don't know.
NICK: Hey. Look. There must be something. LINDA looks at him, tears streaming down her face.
LINDA: I'm just so lonely.
NICK: C'mon. I've got the car.
LINDA: ( shakes her head ) I'll be out. Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine. NICK walks back down the aisle between the bright packages.
NICK: You okay? LINDA nods. NICK fumbles for the door.
LINDA: Let's make love, Nick. LINDA takes him in her arms and holds him tight.
NICK: Sal, we need you. We need you.
SAL: Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
NICK: We do, Sal. We do. You're the Turns SAL and sits on a bench.
SAL: Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
NICK: ( nods ) I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars. SAL laughs.
SAL: Did you go hunting.
NICK: Did you get one?
SAL: Did you get one?
NICK: You didn't get a deer?
SAL: You didn't get a deer?
NICK: I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty! What's this suitcase here?
SAL: Here. Behind you. NICK pulls a suitcase off the rack behind SAL's chair.
NICK: Here. Behind you. NICK pulls a suitcase off the rack behind SAL's chair.
SAL: I don't know. NICK sets the suitcase on a low wall and starts to undo the Maybe Angela brought you stuff. I know she said The suitcase slips over the back of the wall.
NICK: Maybe Angela brought you stuff. I know she said The suitcase slips over the back of the wall.
SAL: Mom keeps sending me socks, Nick. I mean, if it's socks or something just let 'em go.
NICK: It's not socks, Sal. NICK bends over the suitcase and begins going through looking for identification. There is nothing. As he straightens up he notices a wadded-up piece of paper lying beside one of the bundles of bills. The paper is about an inch square. The corners are tattered and it looks as if it had been carried in someone's pocket for a long time. NICK picks the paper up, realizes it is a calling card and unfolds it.
SAL: Who is it, Nick? Who is it? I don't NICK looks at SAL. His head is spinning and he brings himself back with effort.
NICK: It's Merle, Sal.
SAL: Merle? . Merle's alive? How do you know?
NICK: I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
SAL: Merle gave me this?
NICK: But, Nick. Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this? NICK is standing slightly behind SAL, looking down at the money. The reality of what MERLE is doing, has nearly overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he maintains a casual tone.
SAL: But, Nick. Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this? NICK is standing slightly behind SAL, looking down at the money. The reality of what MERLE is doing, has nearly overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he maintains a casual tone.
NICK: Oh cards, maybe. Poker. It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in. We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home. Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
SAL: ( panicked ) Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be
NICK: It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
SAL: Phantom Mary?
NICK: Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
SAL: ( laughs ) ( starts off again ) Well. Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird. You want to hear the whole story?
NICK: ( starts off again ) Well. Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird. You want to hear the whole story?
SAL: ( enthusiastically ) Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird. Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange.

NICK: ( bawling ) Biederman! Where's Biederman!
LIEUTENANT: You Biederman?
NICK: You Biederman?
LIEUTENANT: Biederman, yes.
NICK: I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
BIEDERMAN: Follow me, please.

NICK: Right this way.
NICK: Through here.
NICK: Take off the uniform. The LIEUTENANT stares at NICK, dumbfounded.
LIEUTENANT: Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
NICK: ( exasperated ) Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost ( stiffly ) I will not betray my country. No. NICK throws down the pipe in disgust, whips a gag around the LIEUTENANT's mouth and ties it.

NICK: When I get to Saigon I'll tell 'em where you are. Slams the door.
COLONEL: Jesus Christ, they hit the airport! NICK nods.
NICK: ( leans close ) Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart. NICK nods. EVERYONE starts out.
COLONEL: ( leans close ) Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart. NICK nods. EVERYONE starts out.
COLONEL: Tell you something else. Don't eat 'em in the damn Delta. Unless you like 'em fishy. Some do. I don't. I never did. The scream of the SIREN grows louder. Suddenly a Jeep careens around the corner followed by a huge black Cadillac flying American flags on the fenders. Both vehicles screech to a stop and an MP jumps out of the jeep with a loud hailer.
MP: ( amplified ) Lieutenant Biederman! Lieutenant Biederman report to the ramp!
COLONEL: That's you. Right here, Sergeant! He's right Right this way, Lieutenant. NICK is hurried to the limousine where a SECOND MP holds the Quick as you can, sir. We're in a NICK gets in the limousine. The SECOND MP slams the door, jumps in the front and they take off with sirens wailing.

WIFE: My pleasure.
AMBASSADOR: Henri, we are starved. Six omelettes, s'il vous plait.
WIFE: ( hissing ) Avec champignons.
AMBASSADOR: Avec champignons. Fines herbes? The WIFE shakes her head. The AMBASSADOR winks.
NICK: INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT NICK comes down the corridor behind the MARINE CORPORAL. As he passes a straight-back chair standing against the wall he picks it up and swings it down on the MARINE CORPORAL'S head. The blow is ferocious. The chair splinters into pieces and the MARINE CORPORAL goes down with a dull thud. NICK stands for a moment, looking at him. Then he kneels, removes his pistol and jams it in his belt.
NICK: The back door to the building is open. NICK draws his pistol and goes in.
NICK: ( waves pistol ) It's okay. The REFUGEES cower back even further.
COLONEL: ( no attempt to get up ) Hey, good buddy, how you doin'? ( gestures ) This is Biederman, you guys. Biederman, this is Son Loc, Tu Fon, Huckerbelly and Potts. What's the story here, Biederman? We're looking for. Wait a minute. He fishes a piece of paper out of his breast pocket.
WHORE: Chez Armand not here! Chez Armand has gone to other spot!
COLONEL: ( gets up ) Honey, c'mere. Come right here. The COLONEL opens a brown paper bag he is carrying and presents her with a large red, white and blue dildo.
NICK: You know a guy named Merle?
COLONEL: Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
NICK: Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more. He retired, you know.

REFEREE: ( amplified ) Game number seven. Gentlemen will please wrap. The CONTESTANTS wrap their heads with the scarlet cloth.
REFEREE: Gentleman on the left will now commence play. The REFEREE steps out of the light. A gong sounds. The CONTESTANT on the left picks up the pistol, spins the cylinder, cocks it and places it to his temple. He hesitates, pulls the trigger. and clicks out. NICK is unable to bear it. He turns, starts around toward the back of the stage. AS NICK MOVES THROUGH THE GUESTS WE HEAR
NICK: I came to see Merle.
ARMAND: Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
NICK: ( studies him ) You are his friend.
ARMAND: ( studies him ) You are his friend.
NICK: Where is he???
ARMAND: ( faint smile ) Merle is under his tree. Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
NICK: ( shouts ) MERLE turns, watching NICK as he crosses toward him. When NICK reaches the table, he stands.
MERLE: Nick!. I thought you went home.
NICK: I did. I. This is stolen. I came Sit down. NICK sits. MERLE's self-possession has thrown him. He doesn't know where to start.
MERLE: Sit down. NICK sits. MERLE's self-possession has thrown him. He doesn't know where to start.
NICK: Fine. She's fine. Merle, what the hell are you doing?
MERLE: ( eyes him ) I like it, Nick.
NICK: Merle. Hey, Merle, listen. For a moment MERLE doesn't answer. His eyes are pale, like faded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through NICK, as if to some landscape far beyond.
MERLE: I like it because it's simple. A BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE GIRL steps up and whispers something in MERLE's ear.
NICK: Merle.! Merle, wait! NICK starts after them. He can see them ahead, moving rapidly through a GROUP OF ARVN OFFICERS and WHORES.
NICK: Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. NICK reaches the end of the terrace. MERLE and the BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE GIRL have disappeared.

LINDA: Eat something, Nick. Eat a piece of NICK nods, picks up a piece of toast and then, forgetting all about it, lays it absently on his plate. VINCE comes up behind NICK, looking somewhat officious in a new blue suit.
VINCE: You want to say a few words, Nick? I think you should. Like that would wind things up. NICK nods. VINCE raps on a glass.
