REVISED DRAFT: November 29th, 1992
DARKNESS: A LOW RUMBLE increases in volume.
TITLES OVER: MONTAGE OF CLOCKS starting - various. Second hands turn - TICKING gets louder.
BANG!: The gun goes off. A BULLET RICOCHETS wildly around the room, bounces off the metal bed-head, smashes a vase, embeds itself in the wall. Startled, he holds the gun away from him like it might go off again. He examines it carefully now. Opens the chamber. TIGHT ON THE GUN - Five bullets left. He turns the chamber carefully, shuts it, puts the gun in the inside pocket of the coat. He moves to the bed. A RIPPED PHOTOGRAPH on the rug. A fragment of a woman's face, her left eye. He lifts the fragment up. There's handwriting on the back, part of a note:
WHITE: MANAGER O.S.
WHITE: What? I. How long have I been Jeez, too damn long if you ask me! What about the two weeks y'owe me.
ANOTHER ANGLE: He looks up, wipes his mouth on his sleeve. A breeze tugs at his stringy hair. A tiny ventilation grill above the cistern looks out at the street.
BUMSTEAD: I know, sir, but I can't make it at nine-thirty. It's - um - well,
BUMSTEAD: Yes, sir. I understand. Yes. But, I've done fine so far without an
BUMSTEAD: But. But I. I. Nine-thirty. Yes.
MYSTERY MAN: You are lost, yes?
MYSTERY MAN: Co-operate. Do not make this
MYSTERY MAN: You will not shoot, yes. There is a place in your mind, a corner of
WIDER ANGLE: Bumstead steps up to a bald man with a moustache standing at the end of the corridor. The man, who is dressed identically to the inspector, is his superior: CHIEF-INSPECTOR STROMBOLI.
BUMSTEAD: Good evening, sir.
STROMBOLI: Yes. This way.
MORTICIAN: Welcome, gentlemen. Youíre early. Here for the examination, right?
STROMBOLI: The handiwork of an extremely sick
STROMBOLI: Youíve read the reports. Not much to go on. We know nothing about him, except that he likes to cut them. Always the same type of blade. Forensics match in each case. Anyway, it's all in the reports, read them for yourself.
STROMBOLI: Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
BUMSTEAD: Germs, sir. These places are full of I see. One thingís for sure, heís ambitious. Youíll be a busy man from now on.
STROMBOLI: I see. One thingís for sure, heís ambitious. Youíll be a busy man from now on.
MORTICIAN: You can say that again.
BUMSTEAD: What about Thompson, sir? Wasnít this his case?
STROMBOLI: Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing. Anyway he isnít with us any longer. The case is yours. Go through his files. Take what you need. By the way, howís your mother?
BUMSTEAD: Sheís getting better, thanks. She. Very good.
STROMBOLI: Letís go, Bumstead. So much to do and so little time.
FIGURE 1: We are looking for Jonathan White.
MANAGER: What for?
MAN 1: Which room is he in?
WOMAN: We call.
INSIDE: A total mess - paperwork everywhere, dozens of used coffee cups, rotting food in greasy paper bags. Bumstead shakes his He starts to look around. TIGHT ON FILING CABINET - a drawer is pulled open. Thompsonís files are also a mess. Bumstead continues to shake his head. He reaches for a file. A loud SNAP!
BUMSTEAD: A real shame.
YAAAAAAAAAH!: He recoils. A mousetrap has snapped over his fingers. He pulls it off his hand, throws it to the floor, cursing.
MAN 1: Donít fall asleep. Might never wake, yes. Fifty-six. Fifty-six.
VOICE: Fifty-six. Fifty-six.
WHITE: What? Who are you?
FREDRICK: Címon, letís go! We donít have any
WHITE: Hold it a minute. Letís start at the beginning, huh?
FRERICK: ( looks at White ) Quick! Run!
WHITE: He keeps running.
COP: We got another one upstairs
WIDER: Fredrick steps back, a sigh of relief. A shadow falls across his back. He turns. He screams.
INSIDE: TIGHT ON the fish swimming weakly in the soup. ANGLE ON WHITE - He stops, looks up at O.S. SOUND of clattering metal. A pipe runs the length of the corridor - the invisible clanging cylinder races away, into darkness. Then the silence is shattered by a piercing series of SCREAMS somewhere in the building. White hurriedly moves towards the ANOTHER CORRIDOR White rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular HOLE in a wall. ANOTHER SCREAM, weaker now - He runs to the hole in the wall and looks through.
ANOTHER CORRIDOR: White rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular HOLE in a wall. ANOTHER SCREAM, weaker now - He runs to the hole in the wall and looks through.
BUMSTEAD: MISS CRENSHAW
MISS CRENSHAW: Sorry, sir.
BUMSTEAD: Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
MISS CRENSHAW: Patricia Crenshaw.
MISS CRENSHAW: Iím your new assistant.
BUMSTEAD: I didnít requisition a secretary.
MISS CRENSHAW: The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
MISS CRENSHAW: Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed. All clear now, sir. They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories. Poor man.
BUMSTEAD: MISS CRENSHAW
MISS CRENSHAW: You wonít regret this, sir.
BUMSTEAD: Bumstead moves off.
WHITE: Keep newspapers here, birth certificates, records of deaths, that kind of thing?
LIBRARIAN: Which would you like
WHITE: Okay. Newspapers.
LIBRARIAN: Are you alright? Sure. Iím fine. Mmm-hmm. Stairs at the end of the hall. Third floor. Turn left. Section C-7. Row 35, near the
LIBRARIAN: Donít mention it.
CONTROL ROOM: The note falls from a slot in the wall before Figure 3 ( in shadow yet again ). He reads from the note over a silver microphone, still in the unfamiliar tongue. TIGHT ON A SPEAKER - his distorted voice. A final mysterious person - Figure 4 - listens to the announcement. He takes a stick and moves a small cut-out figure of a man across a board, away from a large grouping of similar cut-outs. The board resembles a planning table in a war-room. A HIGH ANGLE as the CAMERA PULL BACKS on the grouping of cut out figures. More and more of them. Ten. Twenty. A hundred. A sinister army.
WHITE: Iím trying to reach nine zero eight triple two. I canít get through. It is?. Which area is that number listed in?. Is that near the ocean?. The ocean. Never mind. Have a Jonathan White listed?. WHITE. Seventeen? All Johns? I see. Never mind.
WHITE: It is?. Which area is that number listed in?. Is that near the ocean?. The ocean. Never mind. Have a Jonathan White listed?. WHITE. Seventeen? All Johns? I see. Never mind.
BUMSTEAD: What? I donít drink coffee. A cup of tea would be good. Milk and no
CRENSHAW: Making progress?
BUMSTEAD: These are the investigations of a madman. He has fabricated an entire bizarre paranoid delusion with no internal logic whatever. This is a mess. A horrible mess. Itís the second time now.
BUMSTEAD: Look at this!
BUMSTEAD: You typed this report?
MISS CRENSHAW: Yes, sir. Anything wrong?
BUMSTEAD: Wrong? Look at this!
MISS CRENSHAW: It seems fine.
BUMSTEAD: His finger points at the bottom of the page - a tiny, INSIGNIFICANT ink smudge.
BUMSTEAD: How can I submit this?
MISS CRENSHAW: Iím sorry.
BUMSTEAD: Do you wash your hands before you type things?
MISS CRENSHAW: Why, yes.
BUMSTEAD: Well be more careful, please.
CRENSHAW: Inspector Bumsteadís office. Yes. Yes.
MISS CRENSHAW: Yes, sir. The Chief-Inspector said he would see you now.
INSIDE: Bumstead steps into the office - finds STROMBOLI wandering about the room, distracted, searching for something.
STROMBOLI: What is it?
BUMSTEAD: A formality. I need to speak with Thompson. Officially I need your written permission.
STROMBOLI: Why do you want to speak to him?
BUMSTEAD: A hunch. He might be able to. Bumstead, donít be so paranoid. Leave him alone - heís a sad case.
BUMSTEAD: Itís extremely important to my Iíll be the judge of that. Anything Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me. Absolutely not. Up to my ears in cases right now - canít spare
STROMBOLI: Iíll be the judge of that. Anything Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me. Absolutely not. Up to my ears in cases right now - canít spare
BUMSTEAD: Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me. Absolutely not. Up to my ears in cases right now - canít spare
BUMSTEAD: Lost something?
STROMBOLI: What makes you think that! If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked - you might get things done faster, Bumstead.
WHITE: I need something to keep me awake.
BARBER: Looks like you need a haircut to me.
WHITE: Thanks. Just some pills.
BARBER: Only two bucks. Shave as well. Your sign says you sell drugs - well, Iím here to buy some. Okay?
BARBER: Relax. Sure!
BARBER: Tell you what - let me cut yer hair, give ya watcha need half price. Canít argue at that! I donít want a haircut.
LATER: CAMERA TRACKS OFF a clock on a wall - REVEALS WHITE in a barber chair. The BARBER gleefully works on WHITEís hair. A thin OLD GUY in a moth-eaten suit steps from behind a curtain, smiles, playing a violin. Heís passionate but bad.
WHITE: Sell maps?
BARBER: What of?
WHITE: The city. I need to get to the Nope. No maps. Ocean, huh? On
BARBER: Nope. No maps. Ocean, huh? On
BARBER: Grandpa thought customers might like some mood music. You still look familiar. Itís driving me nuts! Sure I donít know ya from somewhere? Not me. Mnunn. Cold lately. That night, couple weeks ago. That was real cold. Remember that?
BARBER: You still look familiar. Itís driving me nuts! Sure I donít know ya from somewhere? Not me. Mnunn. Cold lately. That night, couple weeks ago. That was real cold. Remember that?
BARBER: Mnunn. Cold lately. That night, couple weeks ago. That was real cold. Remember that?
WHITE: Not really.
BARBER: Yeah, Iím like that. Senility says the wife. But she sure canít complain. Heh. The erector set still works good. And this ainít no fucking rug! Gíhead. Feel it! All mine!
GRANDPA: Yes! Feeeeel it!
PRIEST: Beware! The night is deadly. There is a criminal among us.
PRIEST: It could be she! The innocent across the street!
PRIEST: Or the temptress next door!
PRIEST: Or mister nervy stranger at the back!
PRIEST: You are thinking it could be anyone? And youíre right! Why, it could even be Mother! Evil stalks our streets. It seeks to hide in our hearts. Have you not evil within you now? He took my little boy! Iíll rip out his eyes!
GAUNT WOMAN: He took my little boy! Iíll rip out his eyes!
OLDER PRIEST: You have sinned?
WHITE: NO. Ah.
PRIEST: I am listening. Thereís a. woman. I don't know but I think I, ahh.
PRIEST: You fornicated?
WHITE: No. I, ah.
PRIEST: You seem restless.
WHITE: Someoneís after me.
PRIEST: Then we must call the police.
WHITE: No. I mean. that isnít necessary.
PRIEST: I see. Then who is after you? What sins have you committed?
WHITE: Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
PRIEST: Youíre the murderer? Yes! That must be it! Donít kill Shut up! Listen. Walk out quietly.
WHITE: Shut up! Listen. Walk out quietly.
PRIEST: Donít kill me!
WHITE: Shut up!
PRIEST: White loses his temper, grabs the priest, shakes him violently. Faces turn. The priest kicks White in the leg, bites his hand. While White is wincing in pain, the priest breaks away.
CRIMINAL!: People start to scream and run. The GAUNT WOMAN points at Frightened, White holds the gun out. Everyone panics, scatters. People run for the exit. Religious statues topple and smash. The gaunt woman is pushed screaming to the floor, trampled by the crowd. Amidst the chaos, the two MYSTERY MEN appear across the room, see White, head towards him. He turns and runs.
A STAIRCASE: White climbs narrow stairs rapidly.
MYSTERY MAN: It will be inconvenient, yes.
INSIDE: The inspector climbs a staircase, enters a dark room. TWO FIGURES move about. Bumstead glances at a UNIFORMED MAN, standing beside a fake fire, who acknowledges his arrival. To the side, A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER flashes something swinging back and forth, hanging from the ceiling. It looks like. Fredrick. Dead. His arms and legs missing. A pool of blood beneath the mutilated torso. Bumstead looks at the cop.
BUMSTEAD: How long have you been here?
COP: Maybe ten minutes. Thatís strange.
BUMSTEAD: Spinning backwards?
COP: Yours too? I want prints over here.
BUMSTEAD: I want prints over here.
WHITE: I want to see the doctor. It's What time was your appointment? Look! Tell him I'm here. Now. Yes, certainly. Who should I say?
NURSE: What time was your appointment? Look! Tell him I'm here. Now. Yes, certainly. Who should I say?
WHITE: No idea. Just get him.
MAN 1: It has failed.
MAN 2: This is becoming dangerous, yes!
MAN 3: Let's get this over with.
MAN 5: What about the dance-steps! This is my responsibility, we must resolve this issue, yes?
MAN 5: MAN 3 ( pacing the room ) MAN 1 ( cuts in )
MAN 3: The situation has changed. This one is in possession of .to avoid influence, yes.
MAN 4: A freak!
MAN 1: RUMBLING NOISE O.S. attracts everyone's attention. They all look to a round portal high on a wall. The noise is louder. several figures on stilts run past outside the opening - then the noise subsides. The MYSTERY MEN go back to more important
MAN 3: It gets interesting, yes.
MAN 2: Stop this! It has gone too far! Tell Mister Black!
INSIDE: White sits in a leather chair across from an ornate wooden desk. THE DOCTOR paces up and down in front of glass jars containing preserved specimens. He stops, looks at White.
SCHREBER: You remember nothing? Who you are? What you've done?
WHITE: You know something about me?
SCHREBER: Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't Is there nothing you remember? Not even a detail? You must try.
WHITE: You think I haven't been trying! It's like there was never anything Just water.
SCHREBER: Waves. A beach. A woman whispering. That's all. I need to stay awake. Do you have any pills?
WHITE: Waves. A beach. A woman whispering. That's all. I need to stay awake. Do you have any pills?
SCHREBER: What does she say? The woman.
WHITE: Asks my name. Over and over. Just like a broken record. Only thing is, I can't answer. I've no idea what my name is.
SCHREBER: Your name is John White.
WHITE: That's what people keep telling me. And what's this about? Why?
SCHREBER: Bad dreams?
WHITE: Tell me about them. Yeah well, why don't I ask some questions for a change.
SCHREBER: Tell me about them. Yeah well, why don't I ask some questions for a change.
SCHREBER: If you like.
WHITE: You're supposed to be my doctor, That's right. I
SCHREBER: That's right. I
WHITE: Known me for long?
SCHREBER: WHITE ( cuts in )
SCHREBER: I cannot say. You don't know the answer to that?
WHITE: I told you, I can't remember a thing! Look, you know something about me, out with it! Let's end this bullshit! I want answers!
SCHREBER: We won't get anywhere like this. Please. Let's take things in easy
SCHREBER: Put simply. a penetration of the left parieto-occipital area of the cranium. complicated by inflammation that resulted in adhesions of the brain to the meninges. Without going into detail. the formation of scar tissue altered the configuration of the lateral ventricles, producing incipient atrophy of the medulla. Look. It was a simple question. Can someone kill and not remember it? I'm sorry. I get carried away sometimes. Possible? I'm. ah, afraid so.
WHITE: Did she drown? The woman you told me Not exactly. She was found in a canal, disembowelled. Throat cut. Blood drained. The body wrapped in a
SCHREBER: Not exactly. She was found in a canal, disembowelled. Throat cut. Blood drained. The body wrapped in a
WHITE: You remember nothing, eh? Let me show you something.
SCHREBER: You remember nothing, eh? Let me show you something.
SCHREBER: Formation of memories is the most important of brain functions.
SCHREBER: We are little more than a sum of memories. From them we reference who we are, where we're going. Without a past we are nothing. This is why you are so interesting.
WHITE: I'm nothing then.
SCHREBER: The two men look down on a monkey with the top of its head missing, squirming in a mechanical device that restricts its White turns and starts to pace away. Schreber reluctantly
SCHREBER: It feels no pain. Can I get my life back?
WHITE: Can I get my life back?
SCHREBER: Schreber points dramatically at a wooden structure containing two rats.
SCHREBER: We know of two kinds of memory. Firstly, declarative memory. And then there is procedural memory.
SCHREBER: And then there is procedural memory.
SCHREBER: White nods.
SCHREBER: Research on simple animals can be. useful. To show us where memory storing systems are located, for example. I am building an experiment with hamsters next. Cute little things.
SCHREBER: Listen to me talk! You must be
SCHREBER: Whole damn wing lost power. Wiring's old. Keep meaning to get it fixed. Here we are.
SCHREBER: Ah. Beautiful! Head and all! Just how I like 'em!
WHITE: I'm sorry. About before.
SCHREBER: I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though. Trust me completely. I'm here to help. I have to talk to you.
SCHREBER: It can't wait? Excuse me. Ah, make yourself at
WHITE: Still kicking, huh?
SCHREBER: Ah, nearly done. So tell me about your dreams. I'm very interested.
WHITE: Just the typical fabrications of a distorted mind. You know, chased by mysterious men in black, that kind of
SCHREBER: Ah, our friends in black. they are not just a figment of your imagination you know, in fact none of what you are experiencing is anything but real.
SCHREBER: I know everything about you. You have no choice but to trust me.
SCHREBER: Scarey, isn't it? Are you feeling alright?
SCHREBER: Are you feeling alright?
SCHREBER: What are you doing?
WHITE: I have to go.
SCHREBER: You can't go yet. We've got so much to talk about. You're tired. You need to lie down.
SCHREBER: You're tired. You need to lie down.
WHITE: Those pills.
GREY LIMBO: Objects float underwater. They rise upwards amidst bubbles, break the surface. A storm at sea - dismembered BODY PARTS float all the way to the horizon. TWO FOETUSES in separate jars are talking to each other through the glass.
FOETUS 1: This is madness. If we're caught.
FOETUS 2: Shut-up. Help me with these Now you must relax, Anton.
SCHREBER: Leave it!
SCHREBER: Damn! Whoever it is - get rid of
NURSE: Schreber puts the syringe down, fumbles in his pocket, pulls out a huge collection of KEYS on a ring, walks to the nurse, hands them to her. White manages to wriggle a hand free from the leather strap holding him. The nurse leaves, the doctor shuts the door, locks it. He steps over to White.
SCHREBER: I'm sorry I had to put you through this, Anton. There will be some pain, but things will be easier this way.
BUMSTEAD: Hold it!
BUMSTEAD: Police. Nobody move.
SCHREBER: He tried to kill me!
BUMSTEAD: Shut up! Everybody stay calm. You Schreber? What's that? A fish, huh?
BUMSTEAD: What's that? A fish, huh?
BUMSTEAD: ( glances at his watch ) I'm curious? How many so far? What? I. Let's see, there's the little guy with no arms or legs. And the young Young boy?
BUMSTEAD: The six year old. Sure, you Y'know, the kid you left in the meat packing plant, cut into pieces. Packed into brown paper parcels, wrapped in twine, that kind of thing.
BUMSTEAD: You sure have demonstrated a great deal of. imagination. The baby was the best though. Several cops lost their lunch over that one. Head twisted off, spine pulled out, Stop it. You're making me sick.
BUMSTEAD: We count seven so far. Anyone we
VOICE: Inspector Bumstead. Inspector.
BUMSTEAD: What is it, Crenshaw?
CRENSHAW: Just reminding you. your eight pee Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw. Remind me to give you my watch. It needs fixing.
BUMSTEAD: ( looks at watch ) Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw. Remind me to give you my watch. It needs fixing.
CRENSHAW: Yes sir.
WHITE: Where are we going?
BUMSTEAD: Burastead pulls out a small brush, cleans the fallen crumbs from his trousers, keeping a hand on the wheel. White is silent - his wounds continue to bother him. He leans down to scratch through his trousers.
BUMSTEAD: WHITE ( looks up )
WHITE: What are we doing here?
BUMSTEAD: Get out.
BUMSTEAD: Wait here.
BUMSTEAD: Bumstead. I'm here to see my mother.
WIDER: White is standing in a bare room, in front of a finger-printing machine. He's alone. A blast of electrical FEED-BACK. White looks up at a speaker mounted to the wall. White follows a painted line on the floor, stands against a wall, in front of an old-fashioned camera. A slot opens in the wall behind him, mechanical arms spring forward, restrain him, one arm holds a sign with a number in front of him. A flash goes off, the click of a shutter.
MECHANICAL VOICE: Left - profile.
MECHANICAL VOICE: Right - profile.
MECHANICAL VOICE: Move - forward.
VOICE: Move - forward.
VOICE: Watch - the - wheel.
VOICE: Move - forward.
VOICE: Stand - behind - the - screen.
VOICE: Move - forward.
VOICE: Face - the - wall.
VOICE: What's your name? I don't remember.
VOICE: Oh, no?
STROMBOLI: He throws the first shot down on the table in front of White. A black and white police photo of a murder victim.
STROMBOLI: Another photo goes down. Another victim. Another and another. Each more grisly than the last.
STROMBOLI: You'll sign a confession?
GUARD: INT. VISITING ROOM White is led into an empty pale green room with a glass barrier down the middle. The guard tells him to sit and wait. The door on the other side of the barrier opens with a squeak - DOCTOR SCHREBER steps in, looking frightened. The guard just smiles, looks at the doctor knowingly.
SCHREBER: Please, stay calm. This man wants to kill me. Just one of his many delusions - it's nothing. Shut up! Listen, damn you! This is a fortunate coincidence - we won't get another chance like this. Listen to me. What do you want?
SCHREBER: You're innocent. You didn't kill anyone. What am I doing in here then?
SCHREBER: Listen to what I have to say. Decide for yourself.
BUMSTEAD: What's he doing here?
COP: Says he is the man's doctor. You know.
BUMSTEAD: ( into intercom ) I need the file on.. ( reads clip-board ) Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
MISS CRENSHAW: Yes. An "h". The men in black - they're the
SCHREBER: The men in black - they're the
WHITE: You're a liar!
SCHREBER: No, it's the truth.
WHITE: So you're telling me the truth time? Is that it!
SCHREBER: If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
WHITE: Not that again.
SCHREBER: Everyone get's one - very much like But this one's special. It will help you understand, everything. I'm not injecting anything into my Anton - I mean, John, there has been an experiment, a dangerous experiment. I arranged it. It was a lie from the beginning. It almost worked, but things did not go as they should have. You have been left -
SCHREBER: Anton - I mean, John, there has been an experiment, a dangerous experiment. I arranged it. It was a lie from the beginning. It almost worked, but things did not go as they should have. You have been left -
SCHREBER: You can change this, But you must take it.
WHITE: You've been working too hard.
SCHREBER: Please! Don't be foolish! Time is short. Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
WHITE: Don't ask stupid questions. Look at
SCHREBER: Don't ask stupid questions. Look at
SCHREBER: Concentrate. Imagine the syringe rising. Picture it floating above the Do it!
SCHREBER: Do it!
WHITE: It's a trick.
SCHREBER: No it isn't. raise it over the glass and.
WHITE: Oh, sorry.
MECHANICAL VOICE: Your - time - is - up. I gave you your chance, now it's too late. They'll learn you are here soon. It's all over.
BUMSTEAD: Doctor! What brings you here?
SCHREBER: Just visiting my patient.
BUMSTEAD: Really? And how is his state of He's seriously disturbed.
SCHREBER: He's seriously disturbed.
BUMSTEAD: You seem a little edgy. Everything Yes, of course. Everything's fine.
SCHREBER: Yes, of course. Everything's fine.
BUMSTEAD: To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this. Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
SCHREBER: Loose ends?
STROMBOLI: I need to speak to you. Immediately.
STROMBOLI: Bumstead, these. er, gentlemen are here to collect White. Who are you? Please, Bumstead. Co-operate - it's easier.
BUMSTEAD: This is highly irregular. I have a right to know.
MAN 1: We are from a mental asylum.
STROMBOLI: Yes. That's right. He's ill - he needs expert help.
BUMSTEAD: I see.
MAN 1: Yes, Inspector. Has he been displaying any strange. behaviour?
BUMSTEAD: He's been a little angel.
STROMBOLI: If you could show them to the holding cell now.
MAN 1: Where is he?
BUMSTEAD: Yes, sir. I'm sorry. But I don't understand how it was possible. The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed.
STROMBOLI: ( shouts at cringing
COP ): How could you have been so stupid?
COP: I'm sorry, sir.
STROMBOLI: Alright, get out.
STROMBOLI: You stay.
STROMBOLI: Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me. This case is very important to me. Just a little warning: I've got my eye on you inspector, remember Yes, sir.
BUMSTEAD: Yes, sir.
ANOTHER ANGLE: She touches her tongue to his lips. Kisses his face. She pushes him back on the couch and pulls her dressing gown open. White does not respond - seems uncertain. She sits upright, astride his body, unbuckles his belt, opens his shirt, caresses his chest. She stops, her face in shadow. Slowly, White lifts his hands to her breasts, touches them. She starts to breath deeply. OUT OF FOCUS - their bodies entangle, begin to move rhythmically. The CAMERA TRACKS SIDEWAYS, REVEALS a microphone behind a chair, leads us to a mirror on a wall. On the other side of the one-way glass a reel-to-reel tape recorder is picking up the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING.
OUTSIDE: The building the lovers are in SLOWLY RISES into the air, past taller buildings and floats out over the city. Its shadow moves past empty plazas and across faces of grey towers.
INSIDE: White sleeps, as buildings move past outside the window. He opens his eyes, FORCES himself awake. Looks across the dark The JAPANESE WOMAN stands naked at the window, clutching a large red megaphone. IN PERFECT ENGLISH she shouts down at the streets drifting past.
JAPANESE WOMAN: He's up here! He raped me! Hurry! Before he kills again!
OUTSIDE: MYSTERY MEN stand on roof-tops, watching the building drift BACK IN THE ROOM White runs to the window, GRABS the woman. As they struggle, the building is landing softly in another part of the city. LONG SHADOWS move towards the entrance. WHITE WAKES UP AGAIN - finds he is still on the couch. NO SIGN of the woman. Then he notices her standing by the window ( minus megaphone ). The wind pulls at her black hair. A distant SIREN O.S. He gets up, walks over, stands beside her, looks out at the dark city. She ignores him, goes back to the couch, turns on a table-lamp, puts her hands before the lit bulb, casts animal shadows on the wall. White watches her. He walks across and sits next to her. She points to herself. He nods slowly, looks at her. She waits for him to respond with his name. He shrugs, remains silent. Then he puts his hands in the light, makes his own animal shadow.
WHITE: That's me. I'm a shadow.
WHITE: Do I look like a murderer to you?
WHITE: Who is this? What do you know about
ALLEYWAY: Bumstead follows inconspicuously. Without warning, the figure stops and TURNS. Bumstead backs into a doorway to hide. He gets a glimpse of the gaunt features of a MYSTERY MAN in the dim light of the alley. When Bumstead steps into the alley again there is no sign of the Man - like he disappeared into thin air. A SHADOW crosses the wall beside Bumstead. He spins, looking around behind him. Then he looks up into the air.
INSIDE: WHITE stands inside the room, looking at the woman, expressionless. The woman suddenly leaps forward, grabs him, kisses him passionately. White tries to push her away, but she takes his hand, pulls it inside her dress, makes him touch her breasts. He pushes harder, she trips on a chair, falls to the floor. She starts to cry.
WOMAN: WHITE stands inside the room, looking at the woman, expressionless. The woman suddenly leaps forward, grabs him, kisses him passionately. White tries to push her away, but she takes his hand, pulls it inside her dress, makes him touch her breasts. He pushes harder, she trips on a chair, falls to the floor. She starts to cry.
INSIDE: The strange woman looks at White intently between sobs.
WOMAN: Please believe me. It's Your WIFE. I wouldn't lie to you. You told me I could come and see you - now you want to just send me away I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like. Like you're telling me about somebody else's life.
WHITE: I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like. Like you're telling me about somebody else's life.
WIFE: It's the truth. I need you. I know you're innocent.
WHITE: How do you know I'm innocent?
WIFE: Of course you are. You couldn't do those terrible things. Come home with me - maybe things will make sense I can't do that. It's dangerous. What about my parents? Do you know where I can find them?
WHITE: I can't do that. It's dangerous. What about my parents? Do you know where I can find them?
WIFE: They're dead, John.
WIFE: You have an uncle. You were very
WIFE: This is where he lives. I'm sure he would like to see you. Don't you want me? My body? Remember how my skin feels? Touch it. I.
WHITE: What's your name?
ELIZABETH: I want to help.
WHITE: Alright. Here.
WHITE: Know this place? Of course. Your home town - where you grew up.
WHITE: How do I get there? Tell me.
WIFE: That's easy. You.
ELIZABETH: .strange, I forgot.
WHITE: INT. BATHROOM Sachiko locks the door behind her and steps to the middle of the room, lifts a small round rug off the tiled floor. Underneath is a TRAP-DOOR. Opening it, she climbs down a UNDER THE FLOOR In the semi-darkness she moves to a WOODEN BOX. She cranks a small metal handle on the box which makes the lid open. Music plays softly. She looks into the yawning black mouth of the box. A WORM-LIKE apparition threads its way out of the hole, wraps about her thigh. She breaths deeply, shuts her eyes.
THOMPSON: Go away!
THOMPSON: THROUGH THE SPY-HOLE LENS the inspector turns, looks at us, his face DISTORTED, fish-like. Thompson undoes four locks, opens the door a crack, but leaves it chained.
THOMPSON: Can't let you in. sorry.
BUMSTEAD: I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
THOMPSON: Not that. Anything else.
BUMSTEAD: You don't look so well. C'mon, let me in Thompson.
THOMPSON: I can't talk about you understand, that's all.
THOMPSON: Pull up some garbage - make yourself at home.
THOMPSON: They've taken my mind, my memories.
BUMSTEAD: What? Who has?
THOMPSON: Is that your idea of a joke? I don't Take my advice, Bumstead. Get off this case. Now.
BUMSTEAD: What is going on? Wish I could tell you, Bumstead. Strange business. I.
THOMPSON: Get away! Leave me alone!
THOMPSON: It's - it's disgusting, I know.
BUMSTEAD: Jesus! We have to get you to a No. No doctor.
THOMPSON: No. No doctor.
BUMSTEAD: But. How long has this been A few days. a few weeks - dunno, I can't remember. Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again. Now, please leave me alone.
THOMPSON: A few days. a few weeks - dunno, I can't remember. Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again. Now, please leave me alone.
MYSTERY MAN: The line of junction between two
YES!: MYSTERY MAN
MYSTERY MAN: We have located him. Now is the time, yes.
MYSTERY MAN: Let the tuning commence!
THE BATHROOM: White steps into the room, eerily illuminated by a glowing heater stuck to the floor. Water is running - filling the tub and overflowing, making a suspended puddle above White's White takes off his clothes and climbs the wall, towards the floor. It's difficult, but he reaches the tap, turns it off. Pulls himself towards the tub. Gravity becomes NORMAL AGAIN as he sinks in the warm water. He's incredibly weak - floats limply in the bath. Submerges his face. A distant throbbing O.S., like a huge machine heart somewhere in the building. He opens his eyes, still underwater, stares up at the ceiling.
COP: All the same entry wounds. It's definitely him. She lives. lived here. A The other one?
BUMSTEAD: The other one?
COP: His wife.
BUMSTEAD: Jesus. Small world. Where's the photographer?
COP: No one available.
YOUNG COP: They won't come out.
COP: We'll interrogate them anyway.
COP: This is the family of the victim - apparently they were in the apartment when he committed. What are you talking about?
COP: Oh, yes.
COP: They don't speak English.
BUMSTEAD: How will we interrogate them?
COP: Well, sir. I don't know exactly.
BUMSTEAD: It's alright. I won't hurt you.
MISTER BLACK: I have called this meeting for a purpose, yes? It is clear to you we are - unhappy, yes?
SCHREBER: Yes, of course. I.
MISTER BLACK: The tuning failed - when our agents arrived he was gone. He knows things - predicts things. Explain to us, Doctor. Why is the situation this way? Yes?
SCHREBER: I'm not certain I fully understand No excuses, dearest Doctor! Answers. Answers! Answers!
MISTER BLACK: No excuses, dearest Doctor! Answers. Answers! Answers!
MISTER BLACK: You said this would be containable! Nothing works this time. Why is this Why! Why!
MYSTERY MEN: Why! Why!
SCHREBER: I - ah - I. it's a little cold in here don't you think?
MISTER BLACK: We must find him. This is your Yes, of course.
BUMSTEAD: Who is it?
MISS CRENSHAW: Won't say. Says he must talk to you.
BUMSTEAD: Put it through.
BUMSTEAD: This is Bumstead. Who is this?
BUMSTEAD: I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
MISS CRENSHAW: Yes, sir.
BUMSTEAD: All the important stuff. Wrap it up for me.
BUMSTEAD: Please - I'm in a hurry.
BUMSTEAD: Why give yourself up?
WHITE: I - ah - couldn't think of anything else to do. I thought maybe you know something. I'm scared.
BUMSTEAD: That was a pretty good escape act at the station. How did you do that?
WHITE: I woke up in a subway. I don't know how I got there. What are you scared of?
WHITE: People. after me.
BUMSTEAD: I don't know who they are.
WHITE: I don't know who they are.
BUMSTEAD: Why are they after you?
WHITE: Don't know that either.
BUMSTEAD: Don't know much, do you?
VOICE: What is your name. What is your
MISTER BLACK: You have duplicated the personality, It is ready. The Doctor was most
MAN 3: It is ready. The Doctor was most
MISTER BLACK: I hear a clock in my head, and I like We hear clocks in our heads, and we like it!
MISTER BLACK: A world in our likeness!
MEN: A world in our likeness!
BUMSTEAD: Please. Not that way. If you could just follow the covering - the carpet gets stained and it's impossible to clean.
BUMSTEAD: Everything the department knows about John White is in this. Here. Excuse me for a moment.
BUMSTEAD: That stuff helpful? I suppose. Why are you helping me?
BUMSTEAD: You're case has been driving me crazy. You see, I pride myself on being thorough. There's too many loose ends with your case. Thought it was best you were hidden until we understand more about the facts. What do you know about these men in black? If you shoot them here. you can kill them. They're not people - like us - got insects in their heads. Got any disinfectant? It's my legs. Been bitten. Giving me trouble.
WHITE: If you shoot them here. you can kill them. They're not people - like us - got insects in their heads. Got any disinfectant? It's my legs. Been bitten. Giving me trouble.
BUMSTEAD: ( hands things to White ) Careful with your trousers. That stuff stains.
BUMSTEAD: Bumstead paces thoughtfully, careful to stay on the plastic protective covering. He turns, glares at White, who dabs his legs with the cotton wool.
BUMSTEAD: Any idea what part the Doctor plays in this business?
BUMSTEAD: Let's try and find out, shall we. Lace is untied.
BARBER: He with you shortly, sir. Hello, sonny. Cute outfit. Mother get it for you?
BUMSTEAD: I didn't tell you the entire reason I helped you. It started with two little girls. Twins. Used to play with them when I was young. Couldn't remember for the life of me what they looked like, then I understood why.
BUMSTEAD: They didn't have faces.
WHITE: That's right. Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads. No mistake. I just hadn't remembered it that way. Up until then they had been normal little girls in my That's not all. Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had. inconsistencies. It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event. Then I would turn the lights off. Sit down in a comfortable chair. And study each detail of this subject.

Sit down in a comfortable chair. And study each detail of this subject.
BUMSTEAD: Everything was liquid beneath a thin surface that had always seemed solid to me.
BUMSTEAD: Is there anything you haven't told me about this business? Even the most insignificant thing? No. Nothing I can think of. Go on.
BUMSTEAD: Go on.
WHITE: Well. The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean. The point is no one seems to know how to get Why, that's ridiculous. You just.
BUMSTEAD: Why, that's ridiculous. You just.
BUMSTEAD: We'll get to the bottom of this. I mean it.
BUMSTEAD: I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor. Tall fellow. No hair. Rather pale skin.
SCHREBER: I don't know what you're talking That's surprising. He was leaving your office at the time.
BUMSTEAD: That's surprising. He was leaving your office at the time.
SCHREBER: You are mistaken.
WHITE: What are you hiding?
SCHREBER: Nothing. I don't know anything!
SCHREBER: Please, they'll kill me.
BUMSTEAD: I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
SCHREBER: In there.
BUMSTEAD: Just like that?
A CORRIDOR: Through the door - AN ELEVATOR. There is only a down button. Schreber presses it, several seconds later the doors open. They step inside. The doors close, the lift descends.
BUMSTEAD: What is this place?
SCHREBER: You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector. Have patience - you'll see for yourself.
WHITE: White points to a wall featuring a line of brass hooks. On these hooks hang MYSTERY MEN coats - that's not all. Each hook carries A FACE. Bumstead and White step closer, look at the faces. They seem to be elaborate, very life-like MASKS.
SCHREBER: Put them on.
SCHREBER: Get in. Hurry.
WHITE: ( to Bumstead ) Where do you think this goes?
BUMSTEAD: It sure isn't the fun-fair.
SCHREBER: Follow me, and do exactly as I do.
MEN: NIGHT OF THE EYE! NIGHT OF THE EYE!
MAN 2: The Eye is too small for the head of the pin!
MAN 1: ANOTHER MAN stands. Next to the first, who sits again.
MAN 3: What is it that floats on the water? The Eye!
MAN 1: So it goes around the room, each Man takes his turn announcing part of the strange ritual. It will be White, Bumstead and Schreber's turn shortly. White is worried, looks at the
BUMSTEAD: SCHREBER is next - he stands abruptly.
SCHREBER: The eye. Master of time and space!
BUMSTEAD: The Eye - um - delicious with horseradish on rye!
BUMSTEAD: Nothing to it.
WHITE: Eye. eye, captain!
MAN 1: Um - yes.
MAN 4: My spine will bend for the Eye!
BUMSTEAD: Was that for real down there?
SCHREBER: I'm afraid so. What the Quick. My car. What now?
BUMSTEAD: What the Quick. My car. What now?
BUMSTEAD: Quick. My car. What now?
WHITE: What now?
BUMSTEAD: This ocean business. I know where I can find a map. I need to go back to the station. Where will you be?
WHITE: I'll go see an uncle of mine. Five - one - eight - three - double six - three.
BUMSTEAD: ( looks in rear mirror )
BUMSTEAD: Take mine.
PUPPET: ARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!. HA-HA-HA-HA- Where did it go? Don't know.
HA!!: TIGHT ON THE BLADE heading for the spinning wheel. White fires. Shells hit the PUPPET'S car, shattering windows. THE BLADE cuts into the tire - it pops loudly, goes flat, metal SPARKS off the road. White is thrown forward, hits his head on the dash. Bumstead fights to keep control, SWERVES into the side of the other vehicle, making it scrape a concrete wall, hits garbage cans The PUPPET'S car falls behind - then swerves off into a side- street and disappears. Both look FORWARD AGAIN - to see the PUPPET'S CAR pull out in front of them, BLOCKING THE WAY. Bumstead's car is going too fast. Slams the brakes. TIGHT ON PUPPET - Screaming with insane joy as Bumstead's car approaches like a bullet.
BUMSTEAD: Bumstead rips the phone number from the pad. The two men LEAP. The car continues onwards.
INSIDE: White stops in front of a ticket booth, beside a faded blue curtain. In the booth a TICKET SELLER is snoring with his mouth hanging open, his head sagging. White knocks on the window. The man wakes with a start.
TICKET SELLER: Yeah. That's what I said! I'm looking for this address.
WHITE: I'm looking for this address.
TICKET SELLER: Upstairs. Through there.
INSIDE: An entrance hall of an apartment. A large number of MOUNTED FISH of all sizes line the hall. PHOTOS on the wall - family portraits. White examines these, concentrates on one in particular - a young boy on a red push- bike, in the background a sign with a faded image of a girl in a bathing suit: WELCOME TO BLUMBVILLE! it says. A strange WHIRRING NOISE O.S. White hides behind a sofa. Whatever is making the whirring noise moves past slowly. White cannot see what it is.
MAN: Are you alright? What are you doing here? Is this one of your jokes, John? It's been so long, I thought you'd forgotten your uncle Karl?
WHITE: Uncle. Karl.
THE ROOM: White and uncle Karl are having a SLIDE-SHOW. Shots of a recent vacation - the uncle doing a series of mundane things. He changes the slide: an image of him standing against a brick The PHONE RINGS. Uncle Karl wheels over, picks up the receiver. White concerned - takes the phone.
KARL: And this is me again about - um - I would guess about twelve feet further to the right of the last shot. Now just behind the wall is the hotel I stayed at - sweet little place. Hello. Yes, he's here. It's for you.
WHITE: ( he listens ) Oh, it's you. Yes. My uncle apparently. Just looking at some memories. You have? That's good.
BUMSTEAD: At first I thought there was no way to get to the ocean. The buildings are a barrier, no windows, no doors - everything just, well, ends - only thing would be drill a hole. But then, I saw it, one door, just one. Inside a tenement building. We can meet later - but first I have to do something. Look I got to
WHITE: Where can we meet?. Alright.
KARL: Look! This is a good one!
WHITE: What is that door?
KARL: Which one?
WHITE: There. Behind the cabinet. Where does it go?
KARL: Such a joker! Like your father.
WHITE: No. Have a look.
WHITE: You see it?
KARL: Where does it lead?
WHITE: Where does it lead?
KARL: It must be a closet or something.
KARL: Don't trip over. It's dark up there.
KARL: John, I didn't see you there. What is Get back!
KARL: What is Get back!
KARL: Filthy beast! Shoo! Go on! Shoo!
WHITE: The puppet goes for Uncle Karl. A whirr of metal, BLOOD SPLASHES ACROSS WHITE and the walls. Uncle Karl SCREAMS White grabs a chair - holds it above him. The puppet turns from the dead man in the wheelchair. White lets it have it. The chair CRASHES DOWN, splintering into pieces. The puppet is dazed, but immediately recovers. White has a fire-poker now. As the puppet advances, he swings, connecting with the creature, hurtling it across the room, into a wall. White runs out the door.
BUMSTEAD: I can't wait any longer. I'm sorry. I told you, she is being
NURSE: I'm sorry. I told you, she is being
NURSE: Mister Bumstead!
SURGEON: We will teach the pig to meddle in our affairs. Yes.
SURGEON: Ah, Inspector Bumstead! We are glad you are here - I'm afraid we have done all we can. Yes. Your Mother has passed. Yes.
BUMSTEAD: But she was getting better.
SURGEON: We are sorry. The cancer - it was
BUMSTEAD: She doesn't have cancer. We knew that. Yes. Anyway - she is dead. I'll kill you all!
SURGEON: We knew that. Yes. Anyway - she is dead. I'll kill you all!
MYSTERY MAN: You will obey us, yes. In your mind there is a dark space.
TIGHT ANGLE: Bumstead's hand reaches out, fumbles at a tray of surgical implements, grabs a SCALPEL.
WIDER: He cuts into the hand of one of the Men holding him, SPINS AND DRIVES the scalpel into the forehead of the Mystery Man attempting to hypnotise him. The other Men leap towards him.
WIDER ANGLE: White floats in MID-AIR, hovering ten feet or so above a dark body of water. He looks amazed. Shuts his eyes, rubs them, opens them again. Still floating. He clenches his fists and TENSES his body. Slowly he starts to MOVE FORWARD, hovering at an even height over the water.
WIDER STILL: SEVERAL ANGLES feature the figure of White levitating across the harbour, past half-sunken buildings and rusted ships. TIGHT ON WHITE - He comes to a stop. Smiles in amazement. Then he suddenly plummets into the water, like a trap-door has opened beneath him. ANGLE ON BUBBLES floating to the surface. White's FACE rises slowly out of the water.
ON WHITE: Nice knowing you.
WHITE: Nice knowing you.
WIDER: The container crashes into the ground, crushing the creature. Silence. Dust floats in the air.
BUMSTEAD: It's too big to be White. The man steps from the shadows. He's holding a gun, levelled at the inspector. Bumstead lies bleeding, against the wall. He points his own gun at the advancing man and pulls the trigger.
BUMSTEAD: Stromboli is upon him, grabs the empty gun, throws it away, picks up the inspector, leans him against the wall. Without Stromboli holding him up, Bumstead would not be able to stand.
STROMBOLI: Why do you always have to find things out the hard way! Couldn't you just do your job, you idiot? I told you, didn't I? These people are not playing games, Bumstead. They can do anything they want, don't you You're one of them. You bastard. In a way, we all are, inspector! You. Me. Everybody!
STROMBOLI: Time for that early retirement, Bumstead. Didn't bring the gold watch I'm afraid. No. Please.
FIGURE: Ahhh. it hurts!.
WHITE: What happened to you?
SCHREBER: I'm. being. punished.
SCHREBER: I had to - ahhhh - find you. I..
WHITE: What is it?
SCHREBER: We are. living in their dreams.
SCHREBER: Insect. dreams.
BUMSTEAD: His eyes roll up and he GOES LIMP. White stares at the body,
WHITE: I didn't sneeze.
MAN 1: We are looking for the White victims.
MORTICIAN: And who the hell are
MORTICIAN: Over there. Numbers eight to twelve.
MAN 1: Thank you.
WIDER STILL: We no longer make out the figure. The x-rayed environment resembles some intricate aerial map of the vast city - the corridor an ever increasing SPIRAL.
INSIDE: The rooms are empty, derelict, strewn with rubbish. Mould grows on the damp walls. A door stands at the end of a long empty room. He can hear the muffled sounds of SURF, SEAGULLS. White starts to walk forward, smiling. As he approaches the door he begins to feel colder. He opens the door and looks out. A blast of SUNLIGHT - blue ocean and sky.
MYSTERY MAN: There is nothing, Mister White. Beyond the city. Never has been. Unfortunate. Yes?
INSIDE: TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE - In the darkness - he looks across to the Mystery Man standing beside him.
WHITE: How did you know where to find me?
MYSTERY MAN: We knew you would turn up here eventually. Been waiting for you, yes. Hoped you wouldn't make a nuisance of yourself on the way.
MISTER BLACK: White just looks at him, still clutching the small notebook called: ANSWERS.
MISTER BLACK: John White, you are to be tried for murder, yes. You wish to confess to these crimes now?
MISTER BLACK: Very well. The testimony of the prosecutors. Yes.
MISTER BLACK: Something to say? Ready to confess? I didn't kill anyone.
MISTER BLACK: Speak up. Yes. It's lies. Everything.
MISTER BLACK: Bring the witnesses.
MISTER BLACK: You are the accused's parents?
FATHER: That's right.
MOTHER: Wait a minute.
WHITE: Wait a minute.
MISTER SLACK: You had your turn! Let them speak. My parents are supposed to be dead! You can't keep changing the damn rules like this! Why go through this ridiculous set-up! Why don't you just kill me and be done with it! Please, continue.
WHITE: This is insane!
WHITE: It was They killed you.
WHITE: You have invented all this. History is a lie, not just mine, everyone's - a fiction. You are the authors.
MISTER BLACK: A fanciful idea, Mister White.
WHITE: Everyone has a job - a function. Each one teaches you more about your invention. I'm what is called a
WHITE: You've given everybody memories, but I missed out. The Doctor saw to that - played your own game. And now.
WHITE: You're trying to get rid of me.
WHITE: Why do I threaten you? You're scared aren't you?
MISTER BLACK: Ah - a Very inventive.
MOTHER: Please, John, you're embarrassing Shut up! You have proof? Evidence? Yes? It's all here! A book of delusions. Anything else?
WHITE: Shut up! You have proof? Evidence? Yes? It's all here! A book of delusions. Anything else?
MISTER BLACK: A book of delusions. Anything else?
WHITE: But I.
MISTER BLACK: I see. The verdict, yes.
WHITE: Wait, this isn't fair. Guil - ty.
MISTER BLACK: Before I pronounce sentence.
MISTER BLACK: How dare you use your tricks on me!
WHITE: I didn't realise.
MISTER BLACK: Shut up, freak! Monster! You are You'll regret that.
MISTER BLACK: You'll regret that.
MISTER BLACK: This has all gone too far. Yes, much too far.
MONTAGE: A street CRACKS OPEN. Beneath the pavement are pulsating intestine-like organs. These burst open with pus. A building vanishes. A car on a street corner flies into the air. A telephone box STARTS TO SPIN, faster and taster, digging itself into the concrete. Monstrous INSECT LEGS sprout from the hole left behind. Geysers of STEAMING BILE spurt into the night sky. BLACK EXCREMENT forces up out of a sewer, runs down stone THE CITY is coming apart.
FIGURE: Good as new. Yes. Everything is easier now.
FAT MAN: It's small but clean. .and the view's nice. Isn't it?
OUTSIDE: A narrow street and at the end, the ocean. The sound of distant surf, he can taste the salt spray. The man behind him blows his nose loudly and turns to go, shutting the door. White puts the notebook down on a table near the open window.
LATER: White has fallen asleep on the bed. He wakes, troubled. Stands and walks over to the sink next to the bed. He moves like he is underwater. The sea-breeze tugs at the curtain, draws him to the window.
ANOTHER ANGLE: The cracks around the closed door are illuminated, white-hot, by the SUN outside. ON HIS HAND - As he reaches towards the handle. ON HIS FACE - As the door opens. A sharp line of light cuts across his features, as his eyes blink and water. The wind pulls at his messy hair. SURF NOISE is louder now. REVERSE ANGLE - WIDER - OUTSIDE looking through the door, along a long wooden pier jutting out into a blue seascape. At the end of the pier stands the tiny figure of A WOMAN WITH RED HAIR. She looks out at the ocean, her back turned. ANGLE LOOKS BACK at White standing in the open doorway, squints into the sun. Suddenly he looks relieved, almost happy for the first time. He steps OUT OF FRAME briskly - a weight gone from his shoulders. Everything is clear finally, he knows exactly what to do. A voice recites names over a P.A. system.
REVERSE ANGLE: A TRACKING SHOT follows White, moves down the pier toward the woman. As White steps up to her, she turns and smiles. White nods slowly. He looks out of place in his crumpled suit. He stares out at the ocean. Seagulls fly over. Sun reflects off waves.
WHITE: What's your name? John. White.
WOMAN: What's your name? John. White.
WHITE: John. White.
