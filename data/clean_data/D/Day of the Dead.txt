LOVE YOU!: THE ROPE BREAKS suddenly and THE CORPSE FALLS out of frame.
TONY: out to the islands.
MIGUEL: same. Dead. Let's get out to the barrier islands. If there are survivors sending those signals that's where we'll find them.
TONY: same. Dead. Let's get out to the barrier islands. If there are survivors sending those signals that's where we'll find them.
MIGUEL: our.life.on the islands.I think. Miguel is drifting. The sight of the dead city has pushed him a few inches closer to the brink of insanity. He catches himself and comes back toward reality.
MIGUEL: came all this way. We're gonna check it 11 EXT. THE MARINA ( AT THE DOCKS ) - DAY CLOSE ON THE OPEN GASOLINE RECEPTACLE in the hull of AN ABANDONED BOAT. A WOMAN'S HANDS shove a LENGTH OF HOSE down into the hole. The woman, MARIA, puts the other end of the hose to her mouth and sucks the air out. At ANOTHER DERELICT BOAT, TONY sucks on ANOTHER HOSE.
TONY: Let's get outa here.
MIGUEL: the pumps.
MIGUEL: HELLO. IS THERE ANYONE THERE? HELLO. 13 EXT. THE CITY - DAY MONTAGE: as THE WALKING DEAD hear that human VOICE. Throughout the city they turned towards THE SOUND, at once confused and excited. MIGUEL ( o.s. )
MARIA: place. Like all the others.
TONY: place. Like all the others.
MARIA: AY! GASOLINA! GASOLINA! Without warning, A FIGURE pops up from behind the side wall of the trawler. He reaches out and grabs the woman, pulling her against the boat, his arm around her neck, a pistol to her head. TONY sees the action. He dives into the fishing boat, crawls over to his RIFLE and scrambles towards the pilot's controls. With a lightning move, MARIA pulls A KNIFE from her belt. She wrenches around and PLUNGES THE BLADE INTO HER ATTACKER'S CHEST. The man staggers back, screaming. MARIA breaks away and runs across the dock. THE MAN FIRES HIS PISTOL wildly. MARIA IS HIT IN THE ARM. She tumbles forwards onto the decking. TONY reacts, OPENING FIRE WITH HIS AUTOMATIC.
SARAH: primal panic is gurgling up in his throat. With a sudden move, SARAH slams her RIFLE BUTT into the side of his head with all her might. He reels backwards and slams into the boathouse wall. His eyes roll but he stays on his feet, still conscious. CHICO steps away from his post and stands squarely in front of MIGUEL. WHAP! He slugs him with a powerhouse right-cross. MIGUEL still stands. WHAP! He slugs him again. WHAP! Again. Finally, MIGUEL collapses into the man's arms and CHICO lays the limp body down on the deck. BUDDABLAM! RATTATATTATATTATATT! THE ENEMY, sensing an upper hand, starts FIRING WITH MORE INTENSITY. CHICO steps away from MIGUEL and SENDS SOME LEAD BACK their way.
CHICO: HEY ! WHAT ARE WE DOIN' THIS FOR? WE CAN STICK TOGETHER. WE CAN USE EACH OTHER'S At THE TRAWLER, ONE OF THE ATTACKERS shouts a response.
ATTACKER #1: yours. Unless you can get yer boat back ATTACKER #1 bay.tow her around with a dinghy.but she ain't gonna get us nowhere. Ev'ry boat you see here is long dead, soldier.else we'd be long gone. Can you get your boat back here?
CHICO: ATTACKER #1 bay.tow her around with a dinghy.but she ain't gonna get us nowhere. Ev'ry boat you see here is long dead, soldier.else we'd be long gone. Can you get your boat back here?
ATTACKER #1: bay.tow her around with a dinghy.but she ain't gonna get us nowhere. Ev'ry boat you see here is long dead, soldier.else we'd be long gone. Can you get your boat back here?
CHICO: know. I swear.
ATTACKER #1: ain't got the food nor the patience to put up with you. The man FIRES A LONG BURST from his automatic.
CHICO: YOU..YOU MOTHERFUCKERS! He reaches around the corner of the shed with his own rifle and FIRES blind in return. SARAH clambers out through the shed windows having wrapped A LARGE PIECE OF CLOTH around the end of the AXE HANDLE.
YOU..YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!: He reaches around the corner of the shed with his own rifle and FIRES blind in return. SARAH clambers out through the shed windows having wrapped A LARGE PIECE OF CLOTH around the end of the AXE HANDLE.
SARAH: MIGUELITO. MI VIDA. MIGUEL MIO. MIGUEL, trying to scream but needing to vomit, is doing neither. His body is convulsing in the woman's arms. She rubs the sparks on his shirt until they disappear then she caresses him, holding his head against hers, rocking him back and forth.
CHICO: JESUS CHRIST! GET UP HERE, WOMAN! GET THE HELL UP HERE! SARAH has no choice but to help in the fight. She lays MIGUEL as gently as she can on his back. He's gone into deep shock, shivering violently. Rubbing tears away from her eyes, SARAH jumps to her feet, takes up a post and begins to FIRE AT THE ATTACKERS. THE ATTACKERS are grinning like old-fashioned pirates as their GUNS CHEW UP THE DOCK. Suddenly, just behind THE TRAWLER, we see A FLASH
RATTATATTATATTATATTATATT!!!!: ONE OF THE ATTACKERS IS HIT FROM BEHIND. HIS BACK TURNS SOLID RED and HE PITCHES FORWARDS, FALLING between the boat and the dock into the water below. THE OTHER ATTACKER ( #1 ) turns and FIRES IN RESPONSE. TONY IS HIT IN THE STOMACH. He falls to his knees and grabs the side of the boat but he KEEPS FIRING. THE ATTACKER pivots against a mast. For a moment he doesn't realise that HIS NECK HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN BY A LINE OF BULLETS. He tries to scream. Can't. A PLUME OF RED SHOOT OUT OF HIS MOUTH. Then he realises. He realises that he's a dead man. He falls.
MARIA: PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS. TONY is clutching at his BLEEDING BELLY as MARIA, in pain from her own wound, circles the boat towards the edge of the dock.
TONY: PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS. TONY is clutching at his BLEEDING BELLY as MARIA, in pain from her own wound, circles the boat towards the edge of the dock.
SARAH: SARAH calmly raises her .45 and aims it directly at CHICO's head.
CHICO: SARAH calmly raises her .45 and aims it directly at CHICO's head.
SARAH: Reluctantly the man moves towards MIGUEL and the two survivors drag his limp body over the decking.
TONY: sorry.for having offended Thee..offended Thee.
MARIA: of Thy just punishment. because of A coughing fit interrupts his Act of Contrition. From across the open cabin, from within SARAH'S arms, MIGUEL stares. His eyes have the glaze of a madman's eyes. Despite that, and despite the physical trauma he has endured, he seems remarkably in command.

MIGUEL: MIGUEL draws his PISTOL.
MARIA: Thee, my God.Who art all good.and deserving.deserving of all my love.
NOOOOOOOOO!: Thee, my God.Who art all good.and deserving.deserving of all my love.
TONY: Thee, my God.Who art all good.and deserving.deserving of all my love.
MIGUEL: will live. I will live.
MARIA: will live. I will live.
MIGUEL: will live. I will live.
TONY: help.the help of.of Thy grace. TONY collapses. A long, gurgling breath of surrender spills out of him and BLOOD TRICKLES FROM HIS LIFELESS MOUTH.
MARIA: The woman folds TONY'S corpse into her arms as though trying to give it life from her own wounded body. For a long moment there is only the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the tired engine. Then the woman, sensing something, turns back towards MIGUEL. His pistol is raised, aimed at TONY'S head.
MARIA: NO! YOU CAN'T! done to keep him from.
SARAH: done to keep him from.
MARIA: him! You heard his prayer. His prayer will save him. He could never become one of.one of those. devils.
MIGUEL: can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours.our new saviours.our only saviours.
MARIA: One day a dead man will. will.
MIGUEL: and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
MARIA: if you shoot. We must wait. I'll..I'll do it..I'll do it myself..when it needs to be done.
MIGUEL: rise. He will rise and you. you will die. That madman's glaze is wet in MIGUEL'S eyes again. A grin curls his mouth into an odd shape. He freezes, staring, waiting. SARAH shows 30 EXT. DEEP WATER ( WITH THE FISHING BOAT ) - NIGHT A CRESCENT MOON lies on its back. Below, on the pitch black water, its reflection, a vertical stripe, breaks open as THE BOAT passes through it.CHUG-CHUG-CHUG.
CHICO: priest and burn the church. It's the only way. The only way. MIGUEL is sweating profusely yet shivering as though cold. FLIES ARE BUZZING in a cluster around his WRAPPED STUMP. He's over the edge now, insane. And worse than that, the infection from the original bite is spreading. The amputation was not done quickly enough to prevent the parasites from racing through his veins to the brain and SARAH turns towards the madman once her lover. Her heart is too callused for emotion to reach it. She just stares, her eyes dead cold like the eyes of a shark.

CHICO: 34 EXT. THE ISLAND ( WITH THE FISHING BOAT ) - DAY THE BOAT noses into a swamp water backwash. Tall reeds and cypress moss camouflage it completely. It's at though the boat is sailing right onto dry land.
MIGUEL: DATURA!!! DATURA!!! MIRA. DATURA!!! ( She speaks softly, matter-of-factly ) Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
CHICO: ( She speaks softly, matter-of-factly ) Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
CHICO: ( She speaks softly, matter-of-factly ) Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
SARAH: ( She speaks softly, matter-of-factly ) Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
MIGUEL: DATURA!!! DATURA!!! DATURA METEL!!! 36 EXT. THE INLAND JUNGLE - DAY THE GUERILLEROS hack their way through thick undergrowth with MACHETES. MIGUEL is ineffectual. He lags behind the others who are doing trailblazing. THE SOUNDS OF WILDLIFE, excited by the intruders, fill the close, humid air, sometimes beautiful, sometimes grotesque, sometimes startling.
SARAH: alone on this island.
MIGUEL: please. No ice. Thank you. MIGUEL'S eyes roll up into his head. His knees buckle. SARAH grabs him under the arms barely keeping from falling face first into the muddy swamp water. CHICO comes to help.
MIGUEL: NO ICE, I SAID!!! NOOOOO ICE!!! He slams his good hand against the canteen, knocking it away. It plops into the marsh water, its contents lost.
MIGUEL: the church. Burn.. His mouth keeps on shaping words but no sound comes out. He squirms for a moment, then he seems to fall asleep. CHICO looks down at him. Unable to help, he moves off towards solid ground and disappears in the thick brush. After a time, SARAH follows after him.
SARAH: Suddenly there's A GREAT RUMBLING, like the giant gears and pistons of a drawbridge being activated. The iron plate shudders and starts to move, downward, into the earth. SARAH AND CHICO duck into the nearby jungle.

CHICO: be something under the ground 41 EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE ( THEIR P.O.V. ) - DAY SEVERAL FIGURES are rising up in to view, a dozen, maybe fifteen. Details are obscured by FOREGROUND FOLIAGE but we can read helmets, heavy armaments, packs, utility belts. The impression is of a ghostly cadre of soldiers rising from hell. SARAH ( o.s. ) Jesus Christ! CHICO ( o.s. ) It is military. I don't believe it.

SARAH ( o.s. ) Jesus Christ! CHICO ( o.s. ) It is military. I don't believe it.
CHICO: She moves to another spot a few feet away. CHICO follows.
SARAH: She moves to another spot a few feet away. CHICO follows.
SARAH: OH, MY GOD!!! 45 EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY As we CUT IN CLOSER we see that the three slumped figures are ZOMBIES. They are wearing khakis and they are armed with RIFLES AND PISTOL BELTS. Their HELMETS have been painted an identifying bright RED and they wear slipover vests dyed the same bright colour. All the others in the platoon are humans. They, too, wear vests but theirs are not red but WHITE, WITH LARGE ORANGE CIRCLES emblazoned front and back. Two of the men wield LONG ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS for use should the ZOMBIES misbehave, but the creatures, amazingly, are shambling along with the rest of the platoon voluntarily, co- operatively, even somewhat excitedly..the kind of excitement seen in a puppy that's just learned a new trick.
CHICO: Stealthily the woman moves along the edge of the thicket, crouching all the while. CHICO hesitantly follows.
SARAH: Stealthily the woman moves along the edge of the thicket, crouching all the while. CHICO hesitantly follows.
SARAH: Behind her, CHICO gets the dry heaves. He slams his hand into his mouth to keep from making noise.
SARAH: accept..other things. They wouldn't be feeding them with..they wouldn't.
RHODES: only way. They don't bite the hand that reads it in his eyes and is about to say something when a SOUND distracts him. ONE OF THE RAG-TAG ZOMBIES is running amok. THE ZAPPERS poke at the creature but that just makes it angrier.
RHODES: GET THAT THING AWAY FROM THE OTHERS! BRING IT HERE! ONE TROOPER has A LONG POLE WITH A WIRE NOOSE ON THE END. He drops the noose over the wild zombie's head and the wire tightens, biting into the dead flesh on the thing's neck. The pole is long enough to control the creature while keeping it out of reach.
RHODES: He moves slowly towards the thicket followed by TOBY TYLER AND SEVERAL OTHER SOLDIERS. He reaches down to his belt and pushes one of THREE BUTTONS on A UNIT that resembles a pager. ELECTRONIC BEEPS, like the ones we heard earlier, come from the unit, this time in a different pattern. THE RED COAT ZOMBIES respond quickly. They draw their PISTOLS and go marching off after their leader, grunting and snorting like bull apes. RHODES' grin breaks into a wide-open laugh.
RHODES: obey orders the way they do.
RHODES: THAT'S IT, YOU WORM-EATEN SLIME ! YOU FOUL- SMELLING, PUSS-FACED MAGGOTS! I TOLD YOU I'D FIND YOU REAL ACTION, DIDN'T I? YOU CORRUPTION! YOU FILTH! YOU'RE LEARNING! YOU'RE GETTING BETTER..GETTING BETTER.GETTING BETTER, YOU SCUM! The trooper beside TOBY is another young man whose nickname is TRICKS. He and TOBY exchange glances as they trudge along behind the captain and his zombie red coats. Their eyes tell us that they both think Rhodes to be insane, which of course he is.
CHICO: NO! NOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! 57 EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY TWO OF THE RED COATS ARE HIT, but not in the head. Their brains keep functioning and they march on.
RHODES: SPREAD OUT, MEN! OPEN FIRE! Whatever else he is, RHODES seems fearless. He stands in the open as his human soldiers fan out. He notices that the RED COATS are out of ammunition. He pushes another button on his belt unit and MORE BEEPS SOUND. THE RED COATS stop in their tracks. They dump the SPENT SHELLS from their weapons and reload using fresh rounds from their belts. Their fingers are stiff. Three bullets fall to the ground for every one that finds its way into a gun chamber. The SOLDIERS HAVE OPENED FIRE NOW. They are closing in on the 58 EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY CHICO IS HIT high on the right side of his chest. SARAH FIRES A QUICK BURST out into the clearing as she tries to pull the man deeper into the jungle. Suddenly, from right behind SARAH's back, comes A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM. A DARK FIGURE LOOMS UP startling us all.
MIGUEL: BURN THE CHURCH! KILL THE PRIEST! It's MIGUEL, sweating, his eyes sunken into deep black sockets. He is charging toward the clearing with his AUTOMATIC BLAZING in his one good hand. He thunders right past SARAH almost knocking her down.
MIGUEL: KILL THE PRIEST! BURN THE CHURCH! BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN! NOW MIGUEL IS HIT but he keeps coming, his GUN SPITTING. ANOTHER SOLDIER goes down, HIT IN THE MID SECTION.
MIGUEL: MIGUEL squeezes the trigger and his weapon CLICKS sharply. It's The captain's smile slowly returns. He pushes the "Attack" button on his belt unit. THE RED COATS advance, their PISTOLS reloaded. THEY FIRE, stiff-armed and fumble-fingered, at MIGUEL. He sees them moving towards him. Something in his mind clicks and he recognises the creatures for what they are.walking dead. THE FIRST FEW BULLETS MISS. Then ONE HITS HIM IN HIS STUMP and reality gets even clearer. He starts to scream. THE READ COATS walk closer, their dead eyes showing enjoyment of the sport. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
RATTATATTATATTATATT!!!: BULLETS RIP THE PALM FRONDS APART. There's a scream and CHICO somersaults out into view. NEW WOUNDS BLEEDING ACROSS THE CENTER OF
CHICO: me die this way.please. Destroy me. A bullet.in the head.I don't want to become.one of.one of them. TOBY looks down at the man, at his TERRIBLE WOUNDS, clearly fatal ones. TOBY clicks a shell into the firing chamber of his RIFLE. His finger is just sliding under the trigger shield when CAPTAIN RHODES strides up behind him.
RHODES: TOBY is startled by the voice at his back. He turns towards the captain, then he looks back down at the guerillero, hesitating..
RHODES: strength to pull a trigger. Reluctantly TOBY obeys, reaches down for CHICO'S PISTOL.
CHICO: Then..maybe.I can help you out. String him up. THE THIRD SOLDIER reaches down and grabs the wounded guerillero under the arms. TRICKS stoops to help. CHICO screams in agony when he is moved. TOBY lunges in to help the others, thinking to ease the man's buckin' for a shit detail lately so here's one you're gonna love. We've got two dead. Cut the heads off and get the bodies underground to the refrigerators. Fast. It's a hot day. TOBY grimaces but doesn't speak. He turns and moves briskly towards the clearing. RHODES watches him go.

RHODES: TOBY looks down at the remains of the one-armed guerillero.
RHODES: really had the chance to get acquainted. When he comes back.I'll get another shot at it. Ha ha ha ha.
CHICO: after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there.wanting to eat.needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't CHICO is weeping now. With a found spurt of energy he struggles against the rope. No use. It only brings pain.

RHODES: be mad for food.crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
CHICO: NO.NOOOOOOO.SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!! on the island?
SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!: on the island?
RHODES: on the island?
CHICO: ( He nods towards MIGUEL'S CORPSE. )
RHODES: headquarters? On the mainland?
CHICO: place.nobody there.
RHODES: or I'll let you hang there no.rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
CHICO: no.rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
RHODES: live in.an empty place.a. others know? Will others come?
CHICO: live in.an empty place.a. others know? Will others come?
RHODES: others know? Will others come?
CHICO: others.no rebels.nobody.it's over.it's ooooo.. The man collapses, unconscious.
RHODES: entitled to burial.
TOBY: entitled to burial.
RHODES: entitled to burial.
TOBY: entitled to burial.
RHODES: them there. Go help with the rest of the RHODES has it in for TOBY ( we'll find out why later ), and of course the feeling is mutual. TOBY sets the bag down on the ground and, seething, he trots off towards the rest of the platoon. TRICKS After a moment, RHODES motions with his head. THE SOLDIER WITH THE LONG NOOSE POLE steps into view with the CAPTIVE ZOMBIE, the one that ran amok earlier. The man follows RHODES towards the jungle, dragging the gurgling creature along, the wire noose digging into the thing's 67 EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY CLOSE: as RHODES' GLOVED HAND jams A HAND GRENADE into THE CAPTIVE ZOMBIE'S gaping mouth. THE SOLDIER WITH THE POLE releases the noose and the two men take off, running.
RHODES: WHO FIRED THAT SHOT? WHO FIRED THAT SHOT? SOLDIERS stand around dumbly. Those with RIFLES in their hands quickly sling them onto their shoulders. They're all afraid of the captain's wrath. RHODES walks towards the line of men with fury in his eyes.
RHODES: fired that shot or I'll have every last one of you chopped up for feed!!! His eyes spot TOBY, standing behind the crate he dropped earlier, his rifle slung.
RHODES: TOBY shouts the word like a West Point cadet and he bravely steps forward. RHODES stares him down, his anger turning sinister.
TOBY: TOBY shouts the word like a West Point cadet and he bravely steps forward. RHODES stares him down, his anger turning sinister.
RHODES: TOBY hands over his rifle. RHODES feels the barrel, sniffs it.
TOBY: TOBY hands over his rifle. RHODES feels the barrel, sniffs it.
RHODES: TOBY hands over his rifle. RHODES feels the barrel, sniffs it.
RHODES: RHODES is sure he's found the guilty man and he's glad it turned out to be his favourite whipping boy. His body relaxes visibly.
TOBY: RHODES is sure he's found the guilty man and he's glad it turned out to be his favourite whipping boy. His body relaxes visibly.
RHODES: will talk while the whole troop is present.but I know some of these men well. I'm sure that a few private conversations will tell me what I already know. You may have earned yourself some time in the Stalag, Tyler. ( Rhodes glances over at CHICO'S body ) Cut him down. That's another head for you to chop off. Leave it with the others. Take the rest of his body down to the freezers. Move it, shit hill. TOBY moves off. RHODES' grin returns.
JOHN: afraid. We're friends. SARAH looks into the strong, good face of JOHN, a tall muscular man, a Caribbean Islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes that seem instantly trustworthy.
JOHN: take my hand away if you won't scream. SARAH nods and JOHN lets her go. There are two other humans standing behind the big man. There's BILL McDERMOTT, wearing the grease- covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy from a hip flask, and there's a smallish woman with a sensitive face who, apparently out of character, is armed to the teeth. She's a deaf mute, nicknamed SPIDER, and she is urgently signing "Come on! Let's get outa here!" with her hands.
JOHN: might have friends. THE GROUP starts moving. SARAH follows voluntarily. We notice that all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw on the foot soldiers, the ones with big orange circles.
JOHN: walking dead.here on Gasparilla's island.
SARAH: long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
JOHN: long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
SARAH: ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's..Gasparilla's. private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee.and his private army, of There were actually walking dead.in uniform.with guns.

SARAH: There were actually walking dead.in uniform.with guns.
JOHN: could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could..well, it could be the end of everything. SPIDER is signing for everyone to be quiet. They all stop in their tracks. BILL McDERMOTT swigs some more brandy. With the stealth of a Mohican SPIDER pushes aside the branches of a giant oleander and peers through.
JOHN: ( SARAH resists, not understanding, somewhat insulted. ) You ain't wearin' a vest. They been taught not to touch the ones with the circles. There ain't no hundred percent, all-a-time rules with the Bees, but most-a-time they leave us alone. The colour on their vests tell ya how much schoolin' they got. It's the ones without colours you gotta watch out for. SARAH gets behind JOHN, his orange circle acting as her shield. He reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his THE ZOMBIES, snarling and showing teeth, move through the thicket. ONE shuffles right past SPIDER AND McDERMOTT. It gets stuck in the bramble, changes course and moves on without attacking. ANOTHER ZOMBIE, a "white", trudges within arm's reach of JOHN, growling all the while. Suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes two angry steps towards the humans who back away. THE ZOMBIES charges. Things happen quickly. JOHN pushes SARAH away and swings the MACHETE. THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE CREATURES SKULL. BLACKENED BLOOD FLIES. An instant later SPIDER'S SICKLE PUNCHES IN BESIDE THE BIG KNIFE. THE ZOMBIE twitches for a moment, its eyes rolling, then it falls, lifeless, to the ground. McDERMOTT trots up beside SARAH. He takes a huge swallow from his flask then offers some to her. She puts the flask to her lips but nothing comes. She holds it out, neck down, to show that it's empty. Sorry. Guess I don't know my own strength. JOHN wipes SARAH'S MACHETE on some thick leaves, cleaning off most of the gore, then he returns the weapon to the woman.
SARAH: watchin' you. We better get as far away from here as we can. We can work the other side of the island tonight.
JOHN: watchin' you. We better get as far away from here as we can. We can work the other side of the island tonight.
JOHN: Cave so far, and we ain't got the whole thing near charted yet. That's what we was doin' out here today. Huntin' for Come on. They find a Bee done like this and they'll know somebody's been out walkin' where they shouldn't have been. JOHN bows his head over the downed ZOMBIE. He mumbles softly. We can't hear the words but we can tell that he's praying, reciting the good words over the corpse of the "white-coat".
SARAH: believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
JOHN: prayer or two.
SARAH: that infects the brain.
JOHN: that infects the brain.
SARAH: that infects the brain.
JOHN: thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
SARAH: thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
JOHN: we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
SARAH: nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
JOHN: here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
SARAH: fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much..traffic.
JOHN: thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail? SARAH is stopped by this. She stares at the big man suspiciously, not sure whether to believe him.
JOHN: about where you landed. But we ain't ready to take you there. Not yet. You see.we need guns, too. SARAH looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas. She thinks for a moment.not very long.then she turns and starts off into the You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
SARAH: You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
JOHN: You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
SARAH: Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here! SARAH plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over her shoulder she disappears. We can't let her go, John.
JOHN: ( He's joking. ) The hell we don't! But that's not what I mean. She'll be dead in ten minutes out there alone. That or she'll be firin' off her automatics and wakin' up the troops.
JOHN: Just an hour or two tonight, that's all. Rhodes might have extra guards on after all the commotion. We'll meet up at number six and go back home together. God save us. And me with me flask dry. I'll never make it. THE GROUP splits up, moving off in two different directions through the darkening underbrush.
SARAH: dead this time or can we be on our way? Without answering, JOHN steams off through the bush pulling SARAH along behind him, his big hand tight around her arm.
GUARD: MARY and one of her assistants, JULIE GRANT, a younger girl, move over to the video console. ONE SCREEN there shows what looks like a prison corridor. CELLS WITH HEAVILY BARRED DOORS run down both sides. We can see the distinct MOVEMENT OF SHADOWS in the corridor. MARY reacts instantly stepping over to AN INTERCOM and pressing A SEND-
MARY: VOICE ( o.s. - filter ) Yes, ma'm. Captain Rhodes. MARY clicks off, infuriated. She hurries towards AN EXIT followed by
RHODES: From me to you. THE RED COAT steps forward and lays its hand on THE HEAD.
RHODES: THE ZOMBIE pulls hard and THE HEAD pops through onto its side of the bars. The creature lurches off towards A COT in the shadows at the rear of the cell where it hunkers down and begins to RAVISH THE HEAD, TEARING FLESH OFF, EATING IT hungrily. On the cell door we notice A PLAQUE with a number ( 5 ) and, written in marker, the Red Coat's nickname, "BLUTO". RHODES moves past OTHER CELLS, each holding A NICKNAMED RED COAT. GRUMPY stands way back in the shadows. TONTO stands near the bars, growling. FATSO is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old who needs to pee. RHODES stops at A CELL marked "BUB!". Inside we see A SILHOUETTE, tall, erect, not moving a muscle. RHODES grins.
RHODES: Henried's pride and joy. RHODES steps closer and BUB snarls warningly.
RHODES: Bub. Friends. I have one more goodie in my sack here. A LOUD, CLANGING SOUND interrupts. RHODES turns to see.
RHODES: worse than yours?
MARY: worse than yours?
RHODES: worse than yours?
MARY: been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
RHODES: Suddenly JULIE SCREAMS, her hands flying to her mouth. THE PLASTIC BAG is still dangling from RHODES' GLOVED HAND. Inside, pressed into the thin plastic, we can see the rough outline of THE FINAL HEAD. THE THING IS SQUIRMING causing the whole bag to wiggle. RHODES drops the bag instantly to the floor. Taking care, he grabs the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard. THE HEAD ROLLS OUT
JULIE: didn't know that..de-caps. revived!
RHODES: be torture for them!
JULIE: be torture for them!
RHODES: admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the.spacing problem.on a small island like this.
JULIE: as much.food.as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.

MARY: else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it! JULIE has calmed herself down. Now she feels angry, betrayed. She looks at MARY accusingly.

JULIE: MARY nods in the affirmative. Tears form in JULIE'S eyes.
MARY: MARY nods in the affirmative. Tears form in JULIE'S eyes.
JULIE: MARY nods in the affirmative. Tears form in JULIE'S eyes.
JULIE: you people know that the rest of us don't? They stare at one another. Whatever bond once existed between them has been severed forever.
RHODES: Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
MARY: RHODES laughs loudly. MARY faces him, hatred boiling away her vocabulary. She can't think of word that are adequate.
MARY: they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be MARY is stopped.by her own guilt. She turns and busies herself gathering books and papers, then she CLICKS OFF A LIGHT and moves toward the doorway where RHODES stands.
RHODES: they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be MARY is stopped.by her own guilt. She turns and busies herself gathering books and papers, then she CLICKS OFF A LIGHT and moves toward the doorway where RHODES stands.
MARY: behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as.exposed to.to things.as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
RHODES: put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
MARY: put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
RHODES: favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
MARY: had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home.to that roommate you mentioned. MARY pushes past RHODES into the hallway.
MARY: An evil grin returns to RHODES' flushed face. He stares at the woman for a long moment, then he lets go. MARY walks away, bristling. RHODES calls after her.
RHODES: starts getting too lonely for you. MARY stops dead. She turns back to see him gloating.
RHODES: Miss Science. I had your roommate assigned.by Gasparilla. to my platoon. What's his name? Tyler? Yes. Toby Tyler. A bubble of fear pushes up in MARY'S throat but she is only letting her anger show. Her stare is fierce, her eyes daggers.
RHODES: today. In fact.you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
MARY: love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
RHODES: to do some thinking. He turns and walks away. MARY stands still for a time, THE SOUND OF RHODES' CLICKING BOOTHEELS surrounding her, swallowing her. In the DEEP BACKGROUND we can HEAR THE MOANS OF THE CAGED DEAD.
MARY: out what's goin' on.
TOBY: move so fast.
MARY: move so fast.
TOBY: move so fast.
MARY: a prick.
TOBY: a prick.
MARY: I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
TOBY: I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
MARY: not a pioneer. I'm not.I'm not strong that way. I need.
TOBY: down here? Christ!
MARY: help.help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
TOBY: monster-maker says. MARY looks into TOBY'S eyes. She's hurt, yet angry. The kind of anger that comes involuntarily when somebody strikes an already sensitive you to come with us. I want that more than anything. I'll send word. I'll let you know a time and a place to meet. We probably won't be able to wait around so if you're not there on the dot.well.if you're not there, I'll know you're not comin'. She grabs him, holding him tightly against her. They kiss, hard and long. TOBY pulls away, looks at her lovingly, then turns and starts toward the guarded apartment. MARY follows.
TOBY: you to come with us. I want that more than anything. I'll send word. I'll let you know a time and a place to meet. We probably won't be able to wait around so if you're not there on the dot.well.if you're not there, I'll know you're not comin'. She grabs him, holding him tightly against her. They kiss, hard and long. TOBY pulls away, looks at her lovingly, then turns and starts toward the guarded apartment. MARY follows.
TOBY: do to me. I figure they'll just send me out to Stalag Seventeen but if.if it's worse than that.Tricks will know. Stay in touch with Tricks. As they approach the door to number 83, THE SOLDIERS there raise their RIFLE to ready positions.
SOLDIER: TOBY hands over his RIFLE and begins to unbuckle his PISTOL BELT. TWO MORE SOLDIERS appear from inside the open apartment.
TOBY: TOBY hands over his RIFLE and begins to unbuckle his PISTOL BELT. TWO MORE SOLDIERS appear from inside the open apartment.
SOLDIER: TOBY hands over his RIFLE and begins to unbuckle his PISTOL BELT. TWO MORE SOLDIERS appear from inside the open apartment.
MARY: the charges?
SOLDIER: special conditioning center. I'm not without influence.
MARY: special conditioning center. I'm not without influence.
TOBY: have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and.
MARY: have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and.
TOBY: She gives up. She looks into TOBY'S eyes.
TOBY: said. Take care of yourself. THE SOLDIERS escort TOBY down the hall without force. MARY watches their backs for a time, then she flings her BOOKS AND PAPERS angrily into the open apartment. She begins to cry.
JOHN: Seventeen. That's where we live. That's where you gonna live, too. Hell's half acre. It's not a nice place. Them boys there is prisoners. What's their punishment? They sent out to the Stalag for a few weeks. That's punishment enough. SPIDER seems to appear from nowhere. She motions and the others follow her through the thick jungle.
PREGNANT WOMAN: TOBY pushes past her and bumps into A SURLY DRUNK.
DRUNK: HEY, YOU FUCK! YOU FUCK! He grabs TOBY and flings him violently against an upright on one of the long huts. THE OTHER TWO PRISONERS move on, abandoning TOBY, disappearing into the crowd. THE DRUNK pulls A RUSTED, HOME-MADE
DRUNK: I OUGHTA SLICE YOU UP, YOU FUCK! YOU CAN'T PUSH ME AROUND LIKE. PUSH ME Suddenly VOMIT rises in the man's throat and he doubles over. TOBY is aware of SOUNDS behind him. At his back, in the hut, A HAIRY FAT MAN, still wearing his boxer shorts and his muddy boots, is wham-bam- bamming A WHORE, who is wearing everything but underwear and boots. There are needle tracks on the woman's arms and her face looks as though she's been beaten brutally. She purses her deep red, damaged lips and blows TOBY a kiss that's meant to be seductive. TOBY moves on down the street. The place is a cesspool full of human dregs, stinking with refuse, filled with the fury and desperation of man in his last days.
JOHN: don't make the grade. Us that ain't.good enough to live inside The Cave. We grow a little food, do a little light manufacturin'.like these here vests, we make these for the massers. We live in our own filth, with bugs and snakes and disease and jungle fever.all the time waitin' to become breakfast for the Bees. JOHN is doing a sales job on SARAH but everything he says is truth. She hears it all, softening to JOHN'S cause. SPIDER has silently lifted A LARGE WOODEN ROUND out of the weeds. It's a camouflaged tunnel entrance.
JOHN: Just keep goin' 'til you reach the end. I'll be right behind you. SARAH starts down into the hole. JOHN and the others prepare to follow. JUNGLE SOUNDS cover the noises they make.
LUKEY: out dere! Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry! Dunno how long she been dat way! Maybe she gettin' ready to come back. THE CORPSE'S HEAD ROLLS AWAY FROM ITS BODY. DOC LOGAN picks up AN
LOGAN: Get it off the table for now. We'll bring this new one in. DIESEL doesn't respond right away. He's heard something.
LOGAN: LOGAN hears it now, A SCRATCHING, SCUFFLING SOUND. He looks at his LOGAN AND LUKEY move to a spot at the back of the room. They remove SEVERAL OF THE PLANKS in the floor. SARAH'S head pops out, gasping for air. Logan recoils, his eyes wide and frightened.
DIESEL: LOGAN hears it now, A SCRATCHING, SCUFFLING SOUND. He looks at his LOGAN AND LUKEY move to a spot at the back of the room. They remove SEVERAL OF THE PLANKS in the floor. SARAH'S head pops out, gasping for air. Logan recoils, his eyes wide and frightened.
LOGAN: LOGAN AND LUKEY move to a spot at the back of the room. They remove SEVERAL OF THE PLANKS in the floor. SARAH'S head pops out, gasping for air. Logan recoils, his eyes wide and frightened.
LOGAN: He stands up too quickly. Dizziness makes him reel. He smashes into AN INSTRUMENT CART, comes up with A LONG-BLADED SCALPEL and holds the thing threateningly aimed at the stranger.
JOHN: In the next moment, SARAH and the others climb out of the tunnel.
JOHN: over there, the big guy. This here's Lukey and that's Doc Logan who's about to cut your tonsils out. SPIDER, the last one to climb into the room, quickly begins collecting WEAPONS, what few the rebels have.
JOHN: why your fancy automatic looks so good to us. We gotta stick it over here with the others for now. They catch us with any kind o' weapon and its death without even askin' your name. SARAH lets SPIDER take her GUN. The deaf mute signs something which SARAH can't decipher.
JOHN: there? I hope you do or the gun ain't worth SARAH roots through her SUPPLY PACK and produces THREE LOADED CLIPS AND SEVERAL BOXES OF LOOSE SHELLS. JOHN notices SOME TINS OF FOOD,
JOHN: darlin'. That stuff is just shoutin' out that it come from the mainland. The shit we get is all C.D. rations. Aspirins and crackers from 1958. SPIDER snatches THE PACK away rather roughly. SARAH is a little disturbed by the action. THE MATERIAL is stashed under FLOOR BOARDS beside the tunnel entrance.
JOHN: shut eye. Me too. We can all get acquainted LUKEY escorts JOHN AND SARAH out of the operating room into the main hospital area. BILL McDERMOTT pulls out his empty flask. Doc, I need a fill up. I'll help m'self if it's alright with you. LOGAN nods distractedly and BILL moves to A SUPPLY CABINET which contains, among other essentials, SEVERAL BOTTLES OF BRANDY. He fills his flask eagerly.
LOGAN: She's alright. Christ, Rhodes and his cossacks wiped out her whole party. Dan near got her. McDERMOTT pockets the refilled flask, takes a long slug from the cabinet bottle before putting it back, and moves out of the room. LOGAN is left alone with DIESEL AND SPIDER.
LOGAN: LOGAN repeats his question, intoned identically as it was before. He's twitching slightly and sweat is pouring down his face. THE THUNDER suddenly seems LOUDER.
DIESEL: real bad.
LOGAN: in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did. LOGAN, a wild gleam in his eye, moves out of the room, following where the others went, that LONG-BLADED SCALPEL still clutched in his hand. The others follow.
JOHN: SARAH can't help but snicker. Suddenly her head spins exhaustion is conquering her body as last. JOHN puts a big arm around her.
JOHN: gotta stay with it for three more minutes. McDERMOTT joins them and the group moves out into the rain. LUKEY waddles back through the maze of cots. LOGAN, SPIDER AND DIESEL have moved to about the center of the big room. The patients around them, their eyes bulging, look like lemurs.
LOGAN: The same intonation again. This guy's wrapping is definitely coming THE ZOMBIE rises up behind LOGAN'S back. It's the woman whose wrist Lukey checked earlier. Its teeth are dripping with drool, its hands reaching out wantingly. LOGAN turns around. Calmly, but with the swiftness of a rattlesnake, he shoots out the hand that's holding THE SCALPEL. THE BLADE SINKS DEEPLY INTO THE ZOMBIE'S FOREHEAD. LOGAN pulls it out and strikes again, and again, and again, like a swordsman thrusting, thrusting, thrusting. Finally the creature collapses. LOGAN wipes the scalpel on his already blood-covered apron. RAIN WATER drops onto him from holes in the roof above. He doesn't seem to notice.
JOHN: Sex, drugs and rock-and-roll. What more could anyone ask for? Most around here ain't interested in changin' their lives. The folks you met.me and them and a couple others is the whole rebel army. Nobody else gives a shit.and they're afraid o' Rhodes. They pass A STRUCTURE WITH AN OVERHEAD SIGN that reads: JOE'S CORNER TAVERN. If there were walls they'd be pushed out by the MASS OF HUMANITY inside. MUSIC BLARES and VOICES form a wall of noise louder than the THUNDER. A FIGHT spills out onto the muddy street, PUSHERS selling all sort of delights accost JOHN and his group.
SARAH: knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers. They come to A LONG HUT WITH A SIGN that reads: THE RITZ.
JOHN: knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers. They come to A LONG HUT WITH A SIGN that reads: THE RITZ.
JOHN: with you but I'll always be close. You gonna hafta take care o' yourself like you said you was able to do. SARAH nods. JOHN smiles at her. His warm, trustworthy eyes seem to glow in the dark.
JOHN: it. You'll get away with it. Nobody really looks at each other around here. Go on in. Get some sleep. He squeezes her hand tightly, then he turns away and moves off with McDERMOTT. SARAH moves into THE RITZ.
FISHER: MARY HENRIED has entered the room. She pulls up and watches TONTO with a kind of dubious interest. TONTO stops chewing. He looks up with exaggerated sadness on his face. Slowly his mouth opens and the chewed piece of meat slides out between his lips. He throws his fork down angrily.
MARY: like the breakfast you're serving, Ted.
FISHER: get into the game maybe they'll learn to like the food.
MARY: Suddenly BLUTO jumps up from the table. He flings his chair aside and tromps right over to MARY. His arms are outstretched and he is making a pleading, Karloff-like SOUND. GUARDS come after him but MARY waves them off.
MARY: MARY extends her right hand to meet BLUTO'S right and they shake vigorously. Then the dumb creature drops his arms and looks around. His brain sends no signal as to what he should do next. THE GUARDS lead him away.
MARY: There's AN OFF-SCREEN GROAN, the sound of a zombie trying to communicate. MARY turns and sees the tall RED COAT names BUB standing in the closest stall trying to attract MARY'S attention. ( He was the one Rhodes referred to last night as "Mary's pride and joy". ) He is wearing WESTERN-STYLE GUN BELTS, SIX-SHOOTER hang in HOLSTERS on both his hips. MARY faces BUB full with her body and delivers a military BUB replies with one of those pathetic sounds that obviously mean something to him. Then he, too, salutes. MARY pulls away, heading for AN EXIT, but BUB calls after her. He makes inarticulate sounds but we catch his drift.

TECHNICIAN: BUB turns towards the target wall looking like a gunfighter on a western street. There's A HUMMING MECHANICAL SOUND. KATCHUNG! A SILHOUETTE pops up. BUB slaps leather.fast. lighting fast. BOTH GUN come up. BLAM-KA-BLAM-KA-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!!! HOLES APPEARS IN THE TARGET.WOP-WOPPETY-WHUMP!!! All in the kill- zones, or damn close. BUB slaps ONE PISTOL back into its HOLSTER. He clicks open the shell- chamber on THE OTHER, dumps the SPENT CARTRIDGES and begins to reload from his belt. MARY stares at the creature's back, mixed emotions showing on her face. BUB turns to face her. Dropping a bullet, he salutes again. MARY hesitates, then salutes back.

MARY: 99 INT. A LOCKER ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING PEOPLE are changing clothes, going on and off duty. JULIE GRANT rushes in and moves to a locker where she pulls out her LAB COAT. MARY HENRIED enters the room, spots JULIE, and rushes towards her.
MARY: JULIE doesn't respond. She buttons her coat never looking up.
MARY: ( still no response ) You were missed this morning. I need you. I don't want you getting your ass in hot water. I won't be able to help you if.
JULIE: JULIE slams the locker door and storms away toward the exit.
MARY: But she's gone. The locker door has bounced open. MARY slams it and it bounces again. She pounds it with her fist. Suddenly, A LOUD BELL SOUNDS. MARY looks at her watch then exits. There are TWO WOMEN cleaning the locker room with MOPS AND PAILS. One of them turns to watch MARY HENRIED exit. We recognise her. It's
PROSECUTOR: wave transmitter in his quarters. He's charged with the theft of that equipment from a government installation and with possession of an illegal radio. GASPARILLA munches on SOME FRUIT. He's a fat man with a handlebar moustache that makes him look like Pancho Villa. As an indication of rank we wears a military jacket but underneath is a Hawaiian shirt with a bold flamingo and palm tree pattern. Around his neck, nestled in the rolls of fat there, is enough gold to stake a small business.
PROSECUTOR: favour of the ultimate penalty for this Tommy Lee. You and Rhodes. We now see that RHODES is present, looking on with a smile.
GASPARILLA: Tommy Lee. You and Rhodes. We now see that RHODES is present, looking on with a smile.
GASPARILLA: raise yer hands. None of THE COUNCILMEN move a muscle. GASPARILLA scans them slowly as he takes a big, wet bite out of a peach.
GASPARILLA: ultimate penalty in this here case? Well, what if I object? What if I object to the ultimate penalty. THE COUNCILMEN look nervous, apprehensive. GASPARILLA'S flexing his influence and swingin' weight arountyere lately. Does anybody at all give two shits fer what I think any more? Well, I'm a- gonna let this guy off. How d'yall like that? And I want the word ta git out I let 'im off. I let 'im off. Not this council. Maybe I can improve my image rountyere. THE PRISONER looks up at GASPARILLA, hatred boiling inside him. GASPARILLA meets his gaze with a power-mad sneer.

GASPARILLA: Seventeen. A year.
PRISONER: WHY DON'T YOU KILL ME! I PREFER TO DIE! I DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH. WITH THIS KIND WELL, PISS ON YOU, MISTER! I JUST SAVED YOUR ASS! YOU DAMN WELL BETTER NOT GO HOLLERIN' LIKE THAT IN HERE! I SPIT ON YOU! THE ULTIMATE PENALTY FOR YOU! BURN IN HELL.FOR THE ULTIMATE SIN! PIG! ALL OF YOU! PIGS! GUARDS drag the screaming PRISONER from the room. GASPARILLA flops back in his chair, flustered but unscarred. His skin is about a foot thick. He pitches the peach and grabs up a mango. MARY HENRIED enters the chamber and rushes toward an empty chair. GASPARILLA checks THE DOCKET on his desk, smiles, and looks up at MARY.

GASPARILLA: You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
MARY: time fer this case, didn't ya? RHODES replaces THE PROSECUTOR on the floor. He smiles at MARY pointedly as he starts his speech.
GASPARILLA: time fer this case, didn't ya? RHODES replaces THE PROSECUTOR on the floor. He smiles at MARY pointedly as he starts his speech.
RHODES: Private Tyler, I don't want to.
MARY: crime against the State. Captain Rhodes think you better.
GASPARILLA: think you better.
MARY: hand ) MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!! MARY'S eyes indicate her frustration and anger but she does shut up. GASPARILLA plops the handful of fruit pulp onto the floor wiping his fingers on his military jacket.
GASPARILLA: hand ) MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!! MARY'S eyes indicate her frustration and anger but she does shut up. GASPARILLA plops the handful of fruit pulp onto the floor wiping his fingers on his military jacket.
RHODES: this. Mr Tyler shot a prisoner against orders. There are eyewitnesses. I've reprimanded Tyler and I've had him sent outside. It's as simple as that.
GASPARILLA: ya did to 'im?
RHODES: out of a sense of mercy. I don't believe Tyler to be dangerous, General. He just needs.discipline. Two or three months outside will teach him.discipline.
MARY: SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE! THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS. SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP! MARY checks herself. There's a perverse air of danger fuming off the fat General. His attitude toward MARY has clearly changed. RHODES has been working on him. MARY seems to have lost this round. She can only hope that's all she's going to lose.

NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP! MARY checks herself. There's a perverse air of danger fuming off the fat General. His attitude toward MARY has clearly changed. RHODES has been working on him. MARY seems to have lost this round. She can only hope that's all she's going to lose.
GASPARILLA: SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP! MARY checks herself. There's a perverse air of danger fuming off the fat General. His attitude toward MARY has clearly changed. RHODES has been working on him. MARY seems to have lost this round. She can only hope that's all she's going to lose.
GASPARILLA: considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
MARY: I.spoke out of turn. It's just that.Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by.
GASPARILLA: that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
GASPARILLA: got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
MARY: We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there.to various other forms o' physical therapy. MARY shoots a hate-filled eye full at RHODES. THE CAPTAIN responds with a phoney look of sympathy.
GASPARILLA: We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there.to various other forms o' physical therapy. MARY shoots a hate-filled eye full at RHODES. THE CAPTAIN responds with a phoney look of sympathy.
GASPARILLA: AWRITE. C'MON LADIES. OFF WITH IT. AND ON WITH IT.HA HA HA. MUSIC BLARES and SEVERAL OF THE COURTESANS spring up, stripping off what few clothes they are wearing. Some strip naked, others down to panties. They hop onto various exercise machines and begin to "workout", tits flopping, thighs pumping.GASPARILLA'S kind of Look at this.will ya jus' loooooook at these lovelies! Say, Henried, you ever try it with another woman? MARY looks up at the General, not knowing whether or not she should answer, afraid of what he might try to make her do.
GASPARILLA: Look at this.will ya jus' loooooook at these lovelies! Say, Henried, you ever try it with another woman? MARY looks up at the General, not knowing whether or not she should answer, afraid of what he might try to make her do.
GASPARILLA: FOUR MORE WOMEN have brought in SILVER PLATTERS full of NEW HORS- D'OEUVRES, prepared carefully and laid them out like sushi. They're distributed and people eat them
GASPARILLA: like those? How do those taste? GUESTS look up, not knowing what to expect. MARY fears the worst. She looks around to see RHODES grinning. A knot comes up into her throat. She tries to swallow it down.
GASPARILLA: A FEW OF THE GUESTS are revulsed. ONE MAN starts to vomit and he runs from the room.
GASPARILLA: do a thing like that? I ask ya now, would I? Hah ha ha ha ha. Relief spreads and the bacchanalian atmosphere restores itself. GASPARILLA spills himself out of the tanning coffin and flops down on some pillows near MARY. He grabs up a goblet and swills red wine which runs down his front.
GASPARILLA: here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here.died.went to hell.and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army.MY ARMY!
MARY: We think maybe Detroit. there's some signalling out of Philly.
GASPARILLA: climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day.take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die.ha ha ha.'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA
MARY: is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying ya do.we'll sail on over to the mainland.or any other damn mainland fer that matter.and start us a recruitin' program. There's millions o' Bees out there jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry! GASPARILLA swallows another huge quantity of wine.
GASPARILLA: ya do.we'll sail on over to the mainland.or any other damn mainland fer that matter.and start us a recruitin' program. There's millions o' Bees out there jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry! GASPARILLA swallows another huge quantity of wine.
GASPARILLA: Mary looks down at the man, repulsed and afraid. Suddenly he grabs her LAB COAT. She pulls away and he crawls after her, his belly bouncing along the floor. BUTTONS POP and the coat falls open. He reaches for her blouse. It tears away and for a moment he gets a chubby handful of bare breast. He dives into her but he's unconscious before his face reaches her chest. MARY pulls herself out from under his dead weight. Shivering, she clutches her blouse together and hurries out of the room.
RHODES: REVEILLE! REVEILLE! RISE AND SHINE! RHODES is standing near the entrance. FOUR SOLDIERS are doing the pounding. Stunned, disease-ridden faces look up as CITIZENS are awakened from sleep. Fear sweeps through the place like a tropical their heads chopped open. I want to know who's going outside the compound. I want to know how they're going out. I want to know why they're going out. Until I get these answers.each morning.some of you will Without warning RHODES draws his MAGNUM and.BLAM! BLAM! He shoots TWO COT PEOPLE who happen to be at close range. They tumble to the dirt floor, dead before they hit. RHODES scans the rest of the hut. He spots a familiar face, THE PRISONER from the Council Room, the one Gasparilla saved from a death sentence. The man makes the sign of the cross, knowing what's coming. BLAM! BLAM! RHODES FIRES TWO RAPID ROUNDS and THE PRISONER'S CHEST TURNS RED. He flies off his cot into one adjacent, landing on top of a SCREAMING WOMAN. RHODES AND HIS MEN leave as abruptly as they entered. SARAH is stunned. As PEOPLE around her react with sobs and more screams, she locks her eyes on RHODES. He is moving authoritatively down the street just outside the open- walled structure. He passes within inches of SARAH'S cot which is right against the outside rail. Her emotions well up inside her. She is about to jump out into the street when A BIG BLACK HAND grabs her arm. It's JOHN, who has pushed through the gathering crowd outside.

SARAH: all happening because of me. If I turn myself in.
JOHN: bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies. Behind JOHN on the street TOBY TYLER is looking on. He has heard the conversation. JOHN turns and sees him. His eyes go dark with so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
TOBY: so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
JOHN: me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island. PEOPLE are pushing in closer attracted by the commotion inside the Ritz. TOBY has to make it fast. He whispers.
TOBY: me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island. PEOPLE are pushing in closer attracted by the commotion inside the Ritz. TOBY has to make it fast. He whispers.
TOBY: crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.

TOBY: crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
JOHN: TOBY drifts off into the crowd. JOHN AND SARAH exchange glances.
TOBY: LUKEY, the orderly, picks up A DOLLY which is LOADED DOWN WITH CRATES
TRICKS: LUKEY, the orderly, picks up A DOLLY which is LOADED DOWN WITH CRATES
TOBY: LUKEY, the orderly, picks up A DOLLY which is LOADED DOWN WITH CRATES
TRICKS: LUKEY, the orderly, picks up A DOLLY which is LOADED DOWN WITH CRATES
TOBY: LUKEY, the orderly, picks up A DOLLY which is LOADED DOWN WITH CRATES
TRICKS: open those yet. They might be from the wrong shipment. Just keep 'em around 'til I can check.
LUKEY: 'em innaback for you.
DIESEL: They see TOBY pull away from TRICKS and start down the street following LUKEY. They move out and catch up with TOBY, flanking him.
JOHN: They see TOBY pull away from TRICKS and start down the street following LUKEY. They move out and catch up with TOBY, flanking him.
JOHN: tell him we was rebels?
TOBY: crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
TOBY: canisters.little motors.
JOHN: some automatic rifles.
TOBY: some automatic rifles.
JOHN: some automatic rifles.
TOBY: some automatic rifles.
DIESEL: doesn't prove anything.
JOHN: knows who we are and we ain't got a bunch o' time to mess around with Rhodes shootin' up the joint every mornin'. TOBY, rooting through the open crates, finds THE PISTOLS TRICKS told him about and A FEW BOXES OF AMMO. He tosses one of the guns to JOHN. The big man walks over and puts the weapon back inside the crate.
JOHN: just leave 'em here 'til we ready ta use 108 INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - DAY CLOSE ON: HANDS carefully.very carefully.pouring DROPS OF CLEAR LIQUID INTO A TEST TUBE. The liquid is sweating slowly out of A MILDEWED AND ROTTING STICK OF DYNAMITE which has been softened to near-melting by jungle heat. A DOZEN TEST TUBES stand in a rack, already filled. SPIDER, another woman, SALLY, and a man, JACK, each have their own DYNAMITE STICK. Each is transferring LIQUID SWEAT.which is, of course, nitro glycerine.into A GLASS TUBE. They work in tense silence on the operating table. DOC LOGAN works with them, doing the same delicate procedure. Suddenly his hands starts to tremble.
LOGAN: Take it! SPIDER reaches over and, as gently as possible, takes the VIAL and THE DYNAMITE out of the doctor's hands. She sets the tube in the rack and returns the dynamite to AN OPEN CRATE, years old and crusted with mildew and mud, still half-filled with sticks yet to be drained. The danger passed, they all breathe a sigh of relief. LOGAN wipes the river of sweat from his face. His hands are shaking quite violently now. He pops pills, dry, from his pocket.
LOGAN: alright.in a moment.
JOHN: now. Too sick to be workin' with us on this JOHN, SARAH AND DIESEL are standing in a corner of the room. TOBY TYLER is with them, sweating and obviously nervous.
JOHN: hidin' us out. Let the rest of us handle the physical stuff. It's too much for you.
LOGAN: they made me do.the things they made.me.do. I want so see Rhodes destroyed. I want to see all of them, all of them destroyed. It's my duty.in the eyes of God. In the eyes of God. LOGAN is really flipso now, over the edge into banana-land.
TOBY: dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
JOHN: alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?

JOHN: loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get two hundred people down there. You gonna murder two hundred people?

TOBY: island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get two hundred people down there. You gonna murder two hundred people?
LOGAN: two hundred people down there. You gonna murder two hundred people?
TOBY: two hundred people down there. You gonna murder two hundred people?
LOGAN: the Devil!
TOBY: they don't get blown to kingdom come their food'll be destroyed, their water, medical supplies. They won't have any more power. This island can't support them all, they'll be doomed. Count me out, friends. I'm gonna get my ass outa here. Anybody wants to come along is welcome. Silence falls over the room. Finally JOHN moves towards the door. TOBY follows but before exiting he turns back to face the group once do.but all those people. We don't have the right to be their judges. just like they don't have the right to be our judges. JOHN opens the door and TOBY exits. SARAH follows. JOHN looks around at the faces in the group, then he leaves, shutting the door behind him. There's a long silence, then LOGAN speaks.
TOBY: do.but all those people. We don't have the right to be their judges. just like they don't have the right to be our judges. JOHN opens the door and TOBY exits. SARAH follows. JOHN looks around at the faces in the group, then he leaves, shutting the door behind him. There's a long silence, then LOGAN speaks.
LOGAN: us in the Bible. "They shall be driven from the land of the living down to the world of the dead. That is the fate of those who care nothing for God."
SARAH: with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
JOHN: worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it.or.in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation shouting! Datura Metel!

SARAH: landed our boat.
TOBY: prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
JOHN: prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
TOBY: communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em.without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
JOHN: The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha 110 EXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT THE FISHING BOAT that bought SARAH and her friends to the island sits still in the channel. There are SOLDIERS ABOARD, two of Rhodes' men, pacing the deck, passing a bottle back and forth. JOHN ( o.s. ) Well, we found yer boat, lady, but so did JOHN, SARAH AND TOBY are huddled behind green cover peering out at the boat.
SARAH: the time comes.
JOHN: entrance number five.
TOBY: the Bee cages.
JOHN: They move off stealthily. They enter the clearing with the spectacular PLANTS that Miguel discovered. Six feet tall, their red-gold blossoms like trumpets with their bells down, these are Daturas, nightshades indigenous to southern Florida and parts of the Caribbean. SALLY AND JACK, who we saw working on the nitro sticks, are chopping off the eighteen-inch blossom and stuffing them into LARGE LEAF BAGS. They're wearing HOSPITAL MASKS over their mouth and noses. JOHN moves in to help. TOBY AND SARAH follow but JOHN stops them.
JOHN: while. Can't breathe this grass too long or somebody hafta carry you home. Work goes on in silence.
TOBY: rooms. Nobody's in those at night. You can use them to get around in. Hit the power governors first. Kick a surge into their computer network and you erase everything stored in the memory. Then.over in here.that's where the cages are. On the street outside, a puffing BILL McDERMOTT pushes through the unruly crowd, his face showing alarm. The Doc's gone. Diesel and Jack and Spider with him. They took the guns. and the CUT TO: 113 INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT CLOSE ON: LUKEY, beside himself, almost to the point of tears.
LUKEY: stop 'em, I sweah. They tie me up and stick ( He's waving a pillowcase in his hand, the action accentuating his frenzied state. ) .they stick dis in my mouf. You b'lieve JOHN is in the room with SARAH, TOBY, SALLY AND BILL McDERMOTT. This is now the entire rebel force. THE FLOORBOARDS TO THE TUNNEL have been thrown aside. The weapons are gone. I was in the Cave yesterday workin' repairs. Spider was in on clean up. I seen her talkin' ta some insiders. well, she was scribblin', they was talkin'.mighty goin' in! They got somebody to help 'em from the inside!
TOBY: goin' in! They got somebody to help 'em from the inside!
LUKEY: pistols you buddy send in widda raffs.
TOBY: now! Tonight! Right away! Oh, Lord! ( He polishes of what's left in his flask and moves to refill it from the bottles in Logan's cabinet. )
SALLY: as we ever gonna be. How was they carryin' the nitro, Lukey?
JOHN: as we ever gonna be. How was they carryin' the nitro, Lukey?
LUKEY: neider. You ain't, I sweah. They put it inta Spidah's body.

LUKEY: here.all ovah. He stick dem tubes in dere, like undah da skin.an' den he sews 'em all up. I sweah. I sweah, sweah, sweah!
LOGAN: all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO
HURT SO!: Suddenly, A ZOMBIE lunges from the underbrush, its FACE BADLY DETERIORATED and one of its hands; lost during its human life, replaced by A MECHANICAL HOOK. SPIDER stumbles. She holds her breath and stiffens all her muscles. Miraculously the nitro vials inside her do not explode. LOGAN throws himself quixotically in front of THE

LOGAN: FALLEN ANGEL! THIS IS THE JUDGEMENT DAY WHEN YOU WILL BURN FOR YOUR SINS! THE LORD WILL CAST YOU DOWN TO THE LOWER REACHES AND YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW.. THWOK!!! THE ZOMBIE'S STEEL HOOK SINKS DEEPLY INTO LOGAN'S UPPER falters but only slightly.
LOGAN: .YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW THE PAIN. THE THE ZOMBIE pulls LOGAN towards its DROOLING, WIDE OPEN MOUTH. It's just about to bite when DIESEL CHOPS HIS MACHETE INTO THE CENTER OF THE CREATURE'S SKULL. The thing falls, pulling LOGAN, still hooked, to the ground with it.
LOGAN: YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW THE PAIN OF HELL. THE PAIN OF HELL. DIESEL frees the doctor's shoulder from the hook. BLOOD FLOWS FREELY. DIESEL grabs a handful of DRESSINGS from LOGAN'S PACK and goes to work on the wound.
LOGAN: 115 EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE VENTS - NIGHT SARAH, SALLY, LUKEY AND McDERMOTT stand by while JOHN AND TOBY swing open THE RUSTED GRILLWORK OF AN AIR-VENT in the ground. TOBY is able to swing his upper torso completely down inside.
TOBY: A LEAF BAG is passed in from above. TOBY flags the bag open and BITS OF FLOWER AND POLLEN DUST FLY through the tight space, sucked off into the duct.
RADIO MAN: 118 INT. ENTRANCE NUMBER SEVEN - NIGHT There are only TWO GUARDS posted at the sealed entrance. One is eating from A CAN OF SPAM. The other is reading an old, dog-eared PLAYBOY. A RIFLE BARREL jabs suddenly into "Playboy's" back.
TECHNICIAN: 118 INT. ENTRANCE NUMBER SEVEN - NIGHT There are only TWO GUARDS posted at the sealed entrance. One is eating from A CAN OF SPAM. The other is reading an old, dog-eared PLAYBOY. A RIFLE BARREL jabs suddenly into "Playboy's" back.
JULIE: It's JULIE GRANT, Mary's disgruntled assistant. A YOUNG MAN, another behaviouralist in a WHITE LAB COAT is with her. They both have
JULIE: "Playboy" slowly gets up and starts towards A CONTROL PANEL. At the last minute, he spins around, grabbing JULIE'S GUN BARREL and pushing it away. JULIE'S YOUNG ACCOMPLICE swings his RIFLE BUTT and knocks "Playboy" cold. Then he trains the weapon on "Spam man" again. JULIE moves to the controls, examines them, trips A TOGGLE marked "LOCK" and pushes A LARGE GREEN BUTTON. THE DOOR TO THE OUTSIDE SWINGS OPEN. Beyond is blackness with an occasional patch of MOONLIGHT ON JUNGLE GROWTH. JULIE walks slowly, carefully toward the opening. Just as she is about to cross the threshold into the night, A HUGE FIGURE leaps at her, grabbing her RIFLE and enclosing her in a strangle hold. It's DIESEL. Behind him, comes JACK, his RIFLE ( Sarah's rifle ) levelled off at JULIE'S YOUNG
YOUNG MAN: JACK FIRES ANOTHER BURST and the ORANGE CIRCLE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S CHEST SHOW A DOTTED LINE OF RED. He flies back, a surprised expression on his face, and he flops, dead, right on top of the "Playboy" guard who is lying near the control booth.
LOGAN: ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! THE DOC comes slowly out of the night guiding SPIDER over the threshold and into the hall. LOGAN reminds us of a crazy John Houston, floating on air in a madman's bubble.
JULIE: simply helped us do the Lord's work. LOGAN'S SHOULDER WOUND IS BLEEDING THROUGH ITS DRESSINGS but the doctor, on a holy mission, seems to feel no pain. He guides SPIDER into the light and opens her shirt. DIESEL shoves JULIE against a wall. JACK covers her with his AUTOMATIC. LOGAN removes RED-SOAKED DRESSING from SPIDER'S skin. All over her bare chest and upper belly we see LONG, EIGHT-INCH SCARS, HASTILY STITCHED WITH SUTURE SHOWING. Beneath each is A CIGAR-SHAPED BULGE where a vial of nitro has been implanted. The woman stands on crumbling legs, her arms open outward, a grotesque lampoon of a inflict as surgeons. We'll be in Heaven, child. Soon. We'll be with Him in Heaven.

SPIDER: SPIDER is trying to signal something. She has seen that "PLAYBOY" is crawling into the control booth. LOGAN follows her alarmed gaze.
LOGAN: NO YOU DON'T I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT! I LOGAN charges toward the booth. THE GUARD is half-in-half-out of the glass chamber, his hands reaching for the control panel inside. LOGAN starts to kick him, again and again.
CAN'T!: LOGAN charges toward the booth. THE GUARD is half-in-half-out of the glass chamber, his hands reaching for the control panel inside. LOGAN starts to kick him, again and again.

RHODES: where you are. Nothing will happen to any of you. You're safe here. Men. This last word to A SMALL UNIT OF FOUR TROOPERS standing guard at THE EXIT. RHODES goes steaming through the doors. TWO OF THE TROOPERS FOLLOW, THE OTHER TWO unsling their RIFLES and take up posts just outside in the corridor. THE STEEL DOOR SLIDES SHUT locking GASPARILLA AND HIS COURT inside the gymnasium.MARY HENRIED with gotta let our evenin' get spoiled? Simon sez.GET DOWN!!! MOST OF THE GUESTS are willing to let the party get back to full swing. GASPARILLA grabs A TOPLESS COURTESAN and rocks his fat belly around in an attempted dance. MARY seems to be the only one concerned about the alarm.

TOBY: THE GROUP moves out urgently.
GUARD: TOBY ( filter ) ( on video ) LET US IN. THERE'S BEEN A
GUARD #2: TOBY ( filter ) ( on video ) FER CHRISSAKE! LEMME IN, DAMMIT!
LEMME IN!: THE FIRST GUARD HITS A BUTTON AND THE BIG STEEL ENTRANCE DOOR SWINGS GUARDS completely by surprise. They knock them unconscious and take their WEAPONS. TOBY pushes A BUTTON which causes the outer door to swing shut, then he leads the band down the corridor. They go through A DOOR about a hundred yards from the entrance.
DIESEL: SPIDER, her shirt buttoned again over her new dressings, is carefully signing something. DIESEL reads her fingers.
LOGAN: SPIDER, her shirt buttoned again over her new dressings, is carefully signing something. DIESEL reads her fingers.
DIESEL: JACK steps over to JULIE. He frisks her pockets and finds TWO HAND- DRAWN MAPS showing complete layouts of the Cave.
DIESEL: They move out, DIESEL supporting SPIDER, JACK with his RIFLE ready.
TOBY: Nothing. Toby punches up another code while the others drag THE UNCONSCIOUS GUARD out of the doorway, letting the doors shut behind them. A VOICE comes over the speakers. TRICKS ( o.s. - filter ) TRICKS ( o.s. - filter ) What? Was that you that set off the alarms?
TOBY: TRICKS ( o.s. - filter ) What? Was that you that set off the alarms?

TOBY: TRICKS ( o.s. - filter ) I'll try, Tob. I'm gone. TRICKS clicks off. TOBY levels his AUTOMATIC at the RADIO CONSOLE and
JULIE: command overrides them. JULIE looks through the open entranceway. Barely visible in the DIM BLUE MOONLIGHT are the hulking shapes of TWO.NO THREE ZOMBIES, approaching the open hatch.
JULIE: CUT ME LOOSE! PLEASE! CUT ME LOOSE! 131 INT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHT THE LATCHES ON THE CELL DOOR CLICK. With BUZZING, MOTOR NOISES, THE DOORS OPEN OUTWARD. THE ARMY OF RED COATS marches out into the hall. We might recognise TONTO, BLUTO, SAMSON..we certainly recognise big 132 INT. A HOLDING PEN IN THE CAVE - NIGHT We see A LARGE PEN, its GATE SWINGING OPEN. From inside, MOANING HUNGRILY, come FORTY OR FIFTY ZOMBIES, BLUE COATS AND WHITE. GUARDS outside the pen start to panic. They OPEN FIRE. A FEW ZOMBIES ARE HIT but there are too many, way too many. THE GUARDS turn tail and retreat off into the Cave. THE ZOMBIES are out! Free to find their own suppers!
GASPARILLA: STAY HERE! STAY PUT! WE'LL BE ALRIGHT! WE'RE SAFE HERE! JUST AS SAFE AS ANYWHERE 'TIL WE FIND OUT WHAT'S GOIN' ON! MARY HENRIED takes advantage of the confusion. She slips out behind
NURSE: out. People are panicking.
MARY: out. People are panicking.
NURSE: MARY looks past THE NURSE into A ROOM where A GROUP OF CHILDREN, a dozen or so, ranging from twelve-years-old down to infancy, are huddled. Some are crying.
MARY: be a real evacuation or it could just be a glitch in the system. Wait here for now. I'll.I'll make sure you get the word what to do, okay?
NURSE: MARY takes off down the hall.
LOGAN: Heaven soon. ( Julie's screams penetrate the fog in his brain. He frowns. ) Pain. God forgive the pain inflicted by surgeons. We must atone. We must atone for our sins. His eye is attracted to A LARGE LEVER seemingly separate from everything else. It's marked: SIREN. He pulls it.
LOGAN: 136 EXT. THE SIREN HORN - NIGHT Slowly, THE THROATY WAIL RISES and calls out over the jungle. It's the "Feeding Signal" we heard earlier.
LOGAN: WE WILL ATONE. WE WILL BE THE SACRIFICE.THE COMMUNION.WE OFFER OURSELVES UP.OUR SOUL.AND OUR BODIES. JULIE GRANT finally loses consciousness. MANY MORE ZOMBIES are pressing in through the entrance now. They reach LOGAN and start to tear at him. Something clicks in his brain and he realises what's happening. He starts to scream. His hands find THE PISTOL on the ONE ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF HIS LEFT ARM. He shrieks and brings up
MARY: move. There's rebels out to blow the powder magazine. Come on. Come with us.
TRICKS: move. There's rebels out to blow the powder magazine. Come on. Come with us.
MARY: She turns away and starts back in the direction she came from. TRICKS calls after her.
TRICKS: She turns away and starts back in the direction she came from. TRICKS calls after her.
MARY: She turns away and starts back in the direction she came from. TRICKS calls after her.
TRICKS: SEVEN MINUTES, MARY. EXACTLY SEVEN MINUTES! 140 INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE CAVE - NIGHT RHODES AND EIGHT TROOPERS turn a corridor and there, before them, is a sight out of Dracula's tomb. Moving through the lava-stone arches, between the giant earthen pillars, is THE ARMY OF BLUE AND WHITE ZOMBIES. RHODES and his men can't possibly fight them, there are too many. RHODES spots A DOOR WITH A CAGED RED LIGHT OVERHEAD. They can get to it by slicing through only A FEW OF THE ADVANCING GHOULS.
RHODES: THIS WAY. OVER HERE! SHOOT! SHOOT THEM! SHOOT TO KILL! IN THE HEAD! Their RIFLES BLAZE as they drive through the edge of THE ZOMBIE
TROOPER: RHODES FIRES ANOTHER QUICK BURST, then he turns and moves through the 141 INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT SPIDER is walking along, careful to avoid jolts, support-under her arms by the giant DIESEL. JACK walks with them, his nervousness irritated by the need to move slowly. CITIZENS run past, none of them paying attention to the desperadoes. Suddenly they encounter A TROOP OF SOLDIER who come trotting around a corner. Nervous JACK OPENS FIRE. TWO SOLDIER GO DOWN. A gunfight erupts as the rest of the TROOPS scatter in the hallway, CIVILIANS are caught in the crossfire. TWO ARE HIT. DIESEL manages to steer SPIDER around a corner to safety. JACK keeps FIRING but he's trapped in A HAIL OF BULLETS. A RED LINE CUTS ACROSS HIS CHEST and he flies back, dead, his GUN STILL FIRING. Out of the Troopers' sight, DIESEL checks his map and moves into A DOORWAY, one of several on the area, guiding SPIDER through beside 142 INT. ANOTHER MAINTENANCE SHAFT - NIGHT They find themselves in one of those work corridors. The giant man shoulder his RIFLE and gently lifts SPIDER into his arms. He moves, as smoothly as he can, down the shaft and around a bend.
TOBY: They follow after the others.
TRICKS: They follow after the others.
RHODES: HENRIED! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? Without answering, MARY leads her band through A MANUAL DOOR that leads to the Dormitory.
RHODES: STOP THEM! SHOOT! woman is dangerous!
SOLDIER: woman is dangerous!
RHODES: woman is dangerous!
MARY: us. Try to stay calm.
RHODES: SHOOT IT OPEN! THE SOLDIERS follow orders, TWO OF THEM FIRING AT THE LOCK.
NURSE: She hurries along the caged alley behind the firing stalls guiding THE CHILDREN to an opposite exit. BLAM! BLAM! MARY IS FIRING at AN ORANGE CIRCLE VEST on one of the cut out target figures in the range. THE RED COATS are watching with curiosity, cocking their heads. MARY moves to fire again but BLUTO grabs her hand.
MARY: NO.BLUTO.I'M TRYING TO. The dumb creature keeps his grip. MARY has to appease to him. She grasps his hand and shakes vigorously. When he finally lets go, she aims her PISTOL again and FIRES AT THE VEST SEVERAL MORE TIMES.
MARY: THE ZOMBIES are confused. Exasperated, MARY tears off her own vest and tosses it down the alley. THE RED COATS look befuddled, and a little angry. MARY FIRES at the vest she threw down. TWO BULLETS HIT IT before MARY'S PISTOL CLICKS.empty. There's A POUNDING AT THE DOOR. It's RHODES AND HIS TROOP. Suddenly BUB steps into position. WHAP! One of his famous quick draws! BLAM!!! HE FIRES. THE VEST ON THE FLOOR, MARY'S VEST, IS HIT. BUB FIRES AGAIN, the other gun this time. THE VEST ON THE TARGET IS HIT squarely in the center of its orange circle. TONTO now turns. He lifts his PISTOL and FIRES. THE VEST ON THE TARGET IS HIT AGAIN, off center, but hit.
MARY: THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT! Suddenly THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE RANGE FLIES OPEN. THREE OF RHODES' MEN RUSH IN, wearing, of course, orange circles. THE RED COATS OPEN FIRE. THE TROOPERS ARE CUT TO RIBBONS. Others outside the door duck back behind the walls. THE ZOMBIES lumber toward the open doorway, STILL FIRING AS THEY GO. MARY is backing away through the opposite exit. BUB sees her leaving. He calls to her with a deep, pleading moan. MARY stops and looks at him sadly. He shoots off a military salute. MARY salutes him back. There are tears in her eyes. She turns and hurries off. BUB joins his fellows in pursuit of Rhodes' and his men.
JOHN: with me.
SARAH: with me.
TOBY: he was dead when you left him?
SARAH: he was dead when you left him?
MARY: he was dead when you left him?
SARAH: me. Was he dead? There are tears in SARAH'S eyes.
SARAH: hasn't risen.
TOBY: to lose. THE GROUP pushes ahead. SARAH kneels. She blesses herself and makes the sign of the cross over the corpse. Then she stands to see that JOHN is waiting for her. He holds out his hand, she takes it and follows the others.
SOLDIER: WHO IS IT? WHO'S OUT THERE? JOHN ( o.s. )
BLAST YOU!: THE SOLDIERS hesitate, looking around at the dark jungle. TOBY ( o.s. )
JOHN: We ain't outa here yet. Get yer ass movin' ya dumb bastard. McDERMOTT tries to slug from his flask, finds it empty. With a shrug he tosses the thing into the backwater. THE ENGINE STARTS as JOHN climbs aboard, SARAH AND TOBY giving him their hands.
SARAH: until it's necessary. TOBY turns and looks at MARY. She nods. He releases the PISTOL HAMMER without firing.
SARAH: JOHN gently cups a handful of river water and pours it on the woman's THE OTHER ADULTS, led by LUKEY, file into the river, all lining up before the baptist, waiting their turns to be blessed into this tiny new society.
JOHN: anyway. So we all hopin' that maybe he's up there with you, Lord. This might be the first decent soul we been able ta offer ya in quite a few years. That's a fact. We just gonna. pray, Lord. We gonna pray that what seems ta be happenin' here.is really happenin'.and I'm gonna take the chance and speak these words that I ain't been able ta speak for so long. May he rest in peace
THE OTHERS: 170 EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT THE CORPSE lies in the MOONLIGHT. NIGHT CRITTERS SCREECH AND BURBLE in the jungle behind the sand. It's an eerie scene. SARAH is sitting up, her RIFLE ready in her lap, watching the body. JOHN steps in behind and she startles.
JOHN: He settles easily down beside the woman. The two stare together at the shrouded corpse.
SARAH: dust and blows away on the wind. THE BODY lies silent, rigid under the KHAKI ARMY BLANKET that rises and falls, rises and falls with the Gulf breeze. Suddenly.A LOUD MUSIC CHORD! A SUDDEN MOVEMENT! It's the movement of RED LETTERS that spin up off the head of the corpse and settle before our eyes. The letters read: "THE END ( I PROMISE )"
