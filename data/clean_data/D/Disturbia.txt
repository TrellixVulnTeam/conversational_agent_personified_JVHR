KALE: Whoa, did you see that thing?
JEFF: Settle down, slow it down.
JEFF: You don't want to scare him off. You've got his attention, now just play with him. Tease him a little.

KALE: I need reinforcements!
JEFF: Heave, laddie!
KALE: ( laughing; pulling; Dad, your pirate impersonation How would ya know, have ya ever met one? I doubt it
JEFF: How would ya know, have ya ever met one? I doubt it
KALE: He's freakin' pulling us in!
JEFF: ( laughing ) Never! No Brecht has ever lost a fight to a fish!
KALE: ( grabbing pole ) That fish is going down.
JEFF: ( not missing a beat ) Let's nab the bastard.
JULIE: You're kidding. So I can actually put the burgers away this time?
KALE: Yes, be gone with the red meat!
JEFF: ( into phone as needed ) We're having fish for a week.
KALE: Jeff instinctively reaches his arm in front of Kale as he SWINGS the wheel hard right and SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. But it's not in time. The
DAD: Jeff instinctively reaches his arm in front of Kale as he SWINGS the wheel hard right and SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. But it's not in time. The

JEFF: Kale? Kale, are you okay?
KALE: I think so.
KALE: Oh my God, dad

JEFF: That's okay, I've got it grab the door, I don't need your ass falling on my face

KALE: Dad, here
HIS FEET: to find the edge of the foundering rail underneath. Having at least some footing, Kale reaches back inside
JEFF'S WRIST: slips from Kale's grasp. Kale struggles to hang on, but he's losing the battle and the balancing act. And he knows it. Tears well in Kale's eyes.

SENOR GUTIERREZ: Senor Brecht.
RONNIE: The kid stirs, raises his head. The hoodie falls away to reveal KALE. Longer, disheveled hair. The spark in his eye's been replaced with an empty haze.
SENOR GUTIERREZ: So Kale, think you can stay conscious long enough to tell us your plans for the three wondrous summer months
KALE: Este invierno
SENOR GUTIERREZ: ( correcting ) Este verano voy a
KALE: Este verano voy a
SENOR GUTIERREZ: Kale shuts his eyes, frustrated at the interruption. Senor Gutierrez, also losing patience, steps closer to Kale.
KALE: I don't know, alright? I haven't gotten that far.
SENOR GUTIERREZ: Did you do the homework or not?
KALE: ( no eye contact ) Guess not.
SENOR GUTIERREZ: ( in Kale's face ) You "guess" not. I don't know who you think you are or who you think you're dealing with. You can't give me a straight answer, fine, give me one good reason why I shouldn't fail you right now?

JULIE: Automatic withdrawal. Twelve bucks every day.
PARKER: ( re: a booklet ) Everything else is in the manual.

So make sure you find lots of constructive things to keep yourself busy.

DAD'S OFFICE: Hardwood floor. Ornate, cherry wood desk. Plush leather chairs. Quiet. ON THE DESK dad's reading glasses sit on a stack of papers next to an antique typewriter. THE WALLS adorned with framed, poster-size covers of Dad's books - non-fiction, true account titles: WHISTLEBLOWER - The Inside Story of a Real Corporate Insider; THE SENATOR'S SHADOWS: How Eight Men Conspired to Control One. ON ANOTHER WALL a family portrait of Jeff, Julie, and Kale - age six; Jeff at a book signing, smiling wide. Kale takes it all in from the doorway. His feet never once cross into the room. His eyes say everything. Loss, anger, regret. He gently pulls the door shut.
JULIE: ( heading to the window ) More trash TV?
KALE: ( innocently )
JULIE: The lawyer's sending some papers And your point is?
KALE: And your point is?
JULIE: ( heading O.S. ) I've got two open houses, you've gotta sign for them. That's the You canceled my Xbox subscription.

KALE: Kale races back down the street, his shit-stained feet leaving tracks as he goes. He cuts through Ashley's yard again, yelling at the bracelet all the way
KALE: ( into phone as needed ) Okay, fine, but if I'd known
COURIER: Hi, I'm from McNeill-Stewart law firm, dropping off for Ms. Julie
KALE: Hey doggie, come here.
ASHLEY: enters the room. Digging clothes from boxes, stuffing them in her dresser, then she pulls her hair back, yanks off her t-shirt, revealing a black bra. ON KALE - he continues to watch as Ashley digs a towel out of a moving box, and, with her back to us, pulls off the bra and disappears into the bathroom. Off Kale
RONNIE: ( hula dancing ) Aloooha Senor Ka Dude, you look like hell.
RONNIE: Seriously man, you need some sun.
KALE: ( anxious ) I've got something to show you, too. ( then; slightly crazed ) I mean. there's such structure to it, so many layers, but it's invisible if you're not looking close enough.
RONNIE: What are you talking about?
KALE: The world right outside the window.
RONNIE: ( eyeing his watch ) Just wait. and. ( then ) Three. two. one. dog.

RONNIE: Great, that still doesn't explain why you're in a bathrobe at four in the afternoon.
KALE: ( pulls Ronnie closer ) Will you just look
RONNIE: Dude, he's gonna see
KALE: He can't. We don't have any lights on. Plus the angle's sharper from ground level, it only seems like he could see us. I did the math.
RONNIE: Oh, you did the math.
KALE: Optical illusion, line-of-sight doesn't apply to the subject.
RONNIE: Now tilt your gaze up.
KALE: Now tilt your gaze up.
RONNIE: ( CONTINUED ) D.J. Caruso
DAMN!!: ( CONTINUED ) D.J. Caruso
KALE: C'mon, there's more.
RONNIE: What, I go to Maui, you become a No, stalking's for psychos. These are just simple observations. natural side effects of chronic
KALE: No, stalking's for psychos. These are just simple observations. natural side effects of chronic
RONNIE: ( pleading ) Find your passion, Kale.
KALE: ( pointing out ) So. Robert Giles.
RONNIE: Huh, I guess he likes his grass short.
KALE: Next to him is Judy Thorp. Dude, she freakin' sneaks over to her neighbors' every morning, steals their newspaper, I guess reads it or swipes the coupons, then puts it back before they even wake up.
RONNIE: ( sarcastic ) No shit? ( weirdly eyeing Kale People. You never can tell these
RONNIE: What was that?
KALE: Last stop on the tour.
RONNIE: Oh my God. Who be she?
KALE: Don't know.
RONNIE: What's stopping you?!
ASHLEY: pulls the car into and up the drive. She glances at Kale who nods and smiles back. As the stationwagon heads up the driveway, Kale tries to push himself upright but his feet SLIP. He pitches forward more. He glances back over his shoulder, sees Ashley getting out of the car and looking his way. Kale struggles under his own weight, trying to keep his feet from crossing the line he looks back to Ashley who's now heading toward him. A slight smile crosses Kale's face as
ASHLEY: Can I help you?
KALE: Nope, no I'm fine.
ASHLEY: ( helping him up ) Too late.
KALE: Thanks, that was really humiliating.
ASHLEY: Please. I think any pride you had left was gone a while ago.
KALE: Oh, you mean that thing with the cops? They had the wrong guy, total foul up. I'm Kale by the way.
ASHLEY: Still going.
KALE: I'd help, but. I'm a little spatially challenged at the moment.
ASHLEY: Yeah, you've kinda got the whole Martha Stewart thing going on
KALE: ( nodding ) But minus the 48-hour allowance for office visits. And no lame "Apprentice" spin-off. ( off her laugh ) So where'd you move from?
ASHLEY: I'm a city girl. Born, raised, and Forcefully relocated.
KALE: That doesn't sound good.
ASHLEY: I'm telling you, if I have another clueless jock hit on me or one more soccer mom cuts me off in her oversize SUV, I'm gonna go postal.
KALE: Oh, sorry, I was just gonna see if you wanted to hop in my Hummer and cruise to a kegger. Nice talking to you.
ASHLEY: ( cracking a smile ) Wait, I
ASHLEY: ( quietly to Kale ) My mom she's very polite, always says "please" but she's got that tone, did you notice?
KALE: I know the tone.
ASHLEY: ( heading away ) Oh, I'm Ashley
KALE: Noticed that, too.
KALE: ( to Ashley ) You started without me?
KALE: ( realizing ) Holy shit. A dent
A HAND: suddenly enters frame, lands on Kale's shoulder! Kale SCREAMS, whips around Julie. She SCREAMS, too.
KALE: What? No, I
JULIE: What's going on?
KALE: Nothing, just watching the wind blow.
JULIE: ( re: binoculars ) Anything else?
KALE: No, see for yourself.
JULIE: ( beat; then ) That's okay, I just. wanted to say good night.
KALE: ( now flipping through '65 or '66, couldn't tell.
RONNIE: Check this out. The feds think your missing girl might be related to three murders in Austin. All

RONNIE: Ashley slinks out of her shorts revealing a "near-thong" bikini this time.
DUDE!!: ( re: bikini ) That's definitely new.
KALE: ( re: bikini ) That's definitely new.
RONNIE: Oh, it's so warm, baby.
KALE: Dude, there's no way she heard that.
RONNIE: Dude, there's no way she heard that.
KALE: Dick, my deaf aunt in Omaha heard
RONNIE: ( peering out ) She's got great lung capacity.
KALE: ( pulling Ronnie down ) I think she saw me
RONNIE: There's no way
KALE: Kale peeks out THEIR POV - Ashley's slipping back into her shorts and tank top. She heads to the back door, tries the knob. Locked. Over this, Ronnie turns to Kale:
RONNIE: Her swims always that short?
KALE: ( growing concern ) No, she usually takes her time
RONNIE: Now where is she?
RONNIE: Don't, it could be her!
KALE: It's not gonna be her.
RONNIE: Then stop! Just let 'em go away.
KALE: I have to.
RONNIE: What?! What?! Speak.
KALE: It's her.
RONNIE: You're full of
KALE: She totally saw us
RONNIE: We are so busted. Don't answer it!
KALE: ( re: his bracelet ) Dude, she knows I'm here.
ASHLEY: What took you so long? The house isn't that big.
KALE: Yeah, no, we were playing upstairs
RONNIE: ( covering ) Video games.?
KALE: ( awkward beat; then ) So. what brings you here.
ASHLEY: Oh. Locked out.
KALE: Do you need to call anyone?
ASHLEY: Thanks, but I'd rather stay stranded if you don't mind.
KALE: Uh, sure, come on in
ASHLEY: Nice to meet you. Video games, huh? I like to play.
KALE: Excuse me.
KALE: It's a little messy.
ASHLEY: A little? Anything interesting out there?

RONNIE: Black Mustang.
KALE: 60's era Mustang.
ASHLEY: Gee, that really narrows it down.
KALE: They said it was dented. His has a bashed-in fender.
ASHLEY: ( re: binoculars ) So this is why you're
RONNIE: BINOCULAR POV - Giles pulls the Silver Toyota out of the garage and out the driveway. Ashley suddenly grabs the binoculars from Kale, peers out.
KALE: So that's the infamous black mustang,
ASHLEY: So that's the infamous black mustang,
KALE: ( CONTINUED ) D.J. Caruso
ASHLEY: The one with no dent?
KALE: ( grabbing the binocs )
ASHLEY: Because it was never there in the first place?
KALE: ( grabbing the binocs ) You serious? ( then to Ronnie ) She's right.
RONNIE: Austin, Texas. Texas Longhorns.
ASHLEY: Okay, fine, stakeout. Who's on my shift?
RONNIE: This is all the stuff I could find
ASHLEY: Do you know how long Giles has lived About two or three years.
KALE: About two or three years.
ASHLEY: So he could've lived in Texas. Hey, check this out. "Murderer: Tell Tale Signs of a Serial Killer." Qualifies for free shipping if you pair it with "The Shrine of Jeffrey Dahmer."
RONNIE: "Murderer: Tell Tale Signs of a Serial Killer." Qualifies for free shipping if you pair it with "The Shrine of Jeffrey Dahmer."

KALE: Not that I've seen
ASHLEY: You said he lives alone
RONNIE: What's the fourth?
ASHLEY: ( nonchalant ) Sexual dysfunction.
KALE: ( re: Giles ) He's been gone awhile.
ASHLEY: ( handing him his cell ) How'd you get my phone?
KALE: How'd you get my phone?
ASHLEY: I'm crafty like that.
KALE: What'd you do?
ASHLEY: Every time he calls, that's what you'll hear.
KALE: What the hell?
ASHLEY: ( re: Mr. Pilch ) Three to one he doesn't pick it up.
KALE: So that's why the grass is greener.
ASHLEY: Only in disturbia.
KALE: So why the move?
ASHLEY: What do you mean? The greener grass, the safer pastures.
KALE: No, seriously.
ASHLEY: Well, I guess my mom thought it'd help keep dad on a shorter leash. City life. had its temptations. But my mom pretty much cries just as much as she always did, and dad doesn't care more than ever.
KALE: What did they think, an extra bathroom and two-car garage would actually change things. somehow protect them and you from all that crap you can never escape?
ASHLEY: Something like that. So. what're your issues, Kale?
KALE: That's him.
ASHLEY: Another car
KALE: DV CAM POV - Giles gets out. Wearing a suit, no tie.
ASHLEY: ( re: Giles ) Cute for a killer.
KALE: How do you know?
ASHLEY: Bright green bracelet's "The Pyramids," purple's "Club 360," the big black stamp's from "Flavor."
KALE: ( over the above ) Missing girl was seen at a club. Didn't say which one though. ( then aside to Ashley ) Your I.D. must be pretty good.
ASHLEY: ( with a smile ) I don't need one.
KALE: He's going in.
ASHLEY: They watch as the woman gets up, moves to the center of the room, and starts to get a little groove on.
KALE: What do you think they're listening Could be radio. See if you can find the station.
ASHLEY: Could be radio. See if you can find the station.
RONNIE: ( eyes closed; grinning

KALE: And she's down for the count.
ASHLEY: Looks like this is as far as you go.
KALE: Looks like.
ASHLEY: Y'know, I have to admit, you're different than I expected.
KALE: What were you expecting?
ASHLEY: I thought you'd be more messed up.
KALE: Does that disappoint you? 'Cause I can be more messed up if you want me No, you're fine.
ASHLEY: No, you're fine.
KALE: "Fine" like your first cousin "fine" or "fine" in kind of a Brad Pitt sorta way?
ASHLEY: "Fine" like your first cousin "fine" or "fine" in kind of a Brad Pitt sorta way?
KALE: "Fine" like your first cousin "fine" or "fine" in kind of a Brad Pitt sorta way?

ASHLEY: He wants her to come back in
KALE: I can't hear
ASHLEY: Let's get closer
KALE: ( re: his bracelet ) I can't
GILES: You really should stay.
WOMAN: I just don't think it's a good idea Where the hell are they?
GILES: You're in no condition
WOMAN: Give me my keys.
GILES: ASHLEY'S POV - She sees Giles make a motion toward the fence. Suddenly, the woman's CAR KEYS WHACK the other side of the fence, then PLOP DOWN underneath it just a couple of feet from Ashley's position! ON ASHLEY - she startles, looks over, sees the keys. ASHLEY'S POV - She looks back toward Giles and the woman. Hears the woman start to LAUGH. Giles, not laughing, purposefully steps toward the woman, takes her arm.
KALE: ( whispering ) Ashley, come on.
ASHLEY: ( oddly exhilarated ) That was intense.
KALE: Are you nuts?!
KALE: No answer. He heads to.
KALE: Kale darts to his desk, turns off the light, grabs the BINOCULAR POV - Giles and the woman are arguing. The woman paces around the room as Giles stands there. The woman's arms flail about. As she paces back by Giles, he suddenly
KALE: Giles totally busted me.
KALE: They were arguing
KALE: Giles and the girl he brought home. They had an argument, he grabbed her
KALE: And then nothing.
KALE: Dude, something is going on over there. What if he killed her, too?

KALE: Asshole, I'm serious.
KALE: Just wait wait till I check the hall
BOO!: Goddamn you!!
KALE: Goddamn you!!
JULIE: Kale, Kale, it's me!!
KALE: No, don't!
JULIE: What's going on, who were you talking Ronnie just Ronnie.
KALE: Ronnie just Ronnie.
JULIE: I'm sorry, the wind caught it
KALE: Fine. Good. Okay
JULIE: Okay then, so. You want anything from the grocery? I'm going in the morning.
KALE: Anything caffeinated.
GILES: ( picking up the can ) Whoa, whoa, settle down, slow down. Robert Giles, your neighbor ( gesturing outside ) Behind you?
KALE: I know, how did you
GILES: ( to Julie ) Think I startled him.
JULIE: ( laughs ) Oh. Kale, I ran into Mr. Giles at
GILES: ( smiles ) .At the grocery. I had a flat tire when I came out. We tried to change it, but
JULIE: ( smiles ) .At the grocery. I had a flat tire when I came out. We tried to change it, but
KALE: Dad put those security bolts on
JULIE: And that adapter thingy that unscrews it ended up stripping it instead
GILES: My fault.
JULIE: No, it wasn't. You saved my life. We had it towed to Frank's.
KALE: ( with attitude ) Gee, really lucky you were there.
GILES: Just glad I could help. Must be a little difficult when the man of the house is stuck in the
JULIE: Oh. no, it's okay, we're managing.
GILES: I've always been curious about those things, do you mind?
KALE: Yeah, I do.
JULIE: Oh c'mon, Kale. I'm sorry.
GILES: No, no. It's none of my business.
KALE: That's right.
GILES: Whoa, hey, dude. you seem like a straight hitter. You ask me, whoever they are deserved it.
JULIE: ( stepping in ) Okay. I don't think that's the case, and
KALE: I think I'd like to hear his opinion.
GILES: And I think I opened my big mouth again. You're absolutely right. I should go.
JULIE: Wait, what about your coffee?
KALE: I popped my Spanish teacher.
GILES: In that case, cafe con leche, por Shoot, milk's. still in the car.
JULIE: ( searching bags ) Shoot, milk's. still in the car.
KALE: I like your shirt, by the way. I mean, the color.

KALE: Oh, the. that dark orange. Always reminds me of Texas.
GILES: Yeah? You a Longhorns fan, too?
KALE: Sure, absolutely. Even though I've never stepped foot in Texas
GILES: Me neither. Had a lot of friends who went there. I stayed in Minnesota till I moved here.
KALE: So when you say you "popped" your Just a black eye.
GILES: So when you say you "popped" your Just a black eye.
KALE: Just a black eye.
GILES: Phew, just making sure I wasn't living next to some psycho killer. Listen, I get it though. I had plenty of teachers I wanted to just. kill.
JULIE: Kale, could you grab the sugar? Why not.
GILES: ( favors Kale ) Why not.
KALE: I know, he's a total freak, right?
ASHLEY: And very vague. did he genuinely mean it was nice meeting you or was he sending you a "sinister message?"
KALE: Are you messing with me?
ASHLEY: Maybe a little. Did you even notice my hair?
KALE: So you think it's all a coincidence. We've got the car
ASHLEY: With the non dent dent
KALE: The bumper sticker, the argument, the staring contest And now he's showing up in my kitchen
ASHLEY: Why, because he slashed your mom's
KALE: Ashley rolls her eyes.
ASHLEY: It's called "the day after," Kale. Nobody moves after a night like that.
KALE: Well what if she's really "not moving?" What if she's tied in the dungeon with the other girl, starving to death
ASHLEY: ( getting up ) Then come up with a rescue plan and get back to me.
KALE: You're leaving?
ASHLEY: Have to. Party.
KALE: Uh, mine?
ASHLEY: Uh, mine?
KALE: How is that possible?
ASHLEY: Excuse me?
KALE: Well, I mean. Sorry, I just didn't think you knew anybody
ASHLEY: I don't, I didn't I met this girl earlier, Minnie Tyco?
KALE: Oh my god, "Skinny Psycho?!" I sat next to that bitch in Spanish
ASHLEY: ( skipping that one ) I told her my parents were outta And now the whole neighborhood's Look, I'm stuck here. So I figured I can either shut myself in and keep hating it or. try to make the most of it.
KALE: And now the whole neighborhood's Look, I'm stuck here. So I figured I can either shut myself in and keep hating it or. try to make the most of it.
ASHLEY: Look, I'm stuck here. So I figured I can either shut myself in and keep hating it or. try to make the most of it.
KALE: Hey, I get it. You don't have to Kale, you're welcome to come, but
ASHLEY: Kale, you're welcome to come, but
KALE: ( with attitude ) Well, I appreciate the thought. ( returning the tude ) Glad to hear it.
ASHLEY: ( returning the tude ) Glad to hear it.
KALE: It's funny, though.
ASHLEY: ( turning back ) I didn't peg you as a conformist.
KALE: I didn't peg you as a conformist.
ASHLEY: Try to keep these in your drawers tonight, will ya?
RONNIE: ( phone filter ) This is Ronnie, leave a message.
KALE: ( into phone ) Yeah, I'm calling about the Jeep Cherokee that was brought in with the flat and the stripped lug it's ready? Listen, did they have to replace the whole tire they patched it? Is there any way to tell if it was slashed or But a nail usually acts like its own plug for awhile, doesn't it? I mean it's a really slow leak, it can't flatten a tire in twenty minutes. ( beat as Kale listens ) Yeah, I guess anything's possible.
ASHLEY: storming in from the kitchen and marching up the stairs!
KALE: Kale races back to the stairs. Ashley increases her speed.
ASHLEY: ( peering out the window Oh my God
ASHLEY: Back off or I'll throw it where you can't follow.
KALE: Take it easy, that's sixty gigs of my life.
ASHLEY: Even better.
KALE: Okay okay
ASHLEY: What are you doing?
KALE: What are you doing?
ASHLEY: I'm trying to enjoy my party. Wait, that's wrong. According to you, I'm trying to conform
KALE: Coulda fooled me.
ASHLEY: What does that mean?
KALE: No, I'm not gonna forget it.
ASHLEY: No, I'm not gonna forget it.
KALE: You wanna blend in with that crowd, fine, then stop looking up and trying to get a rise outta me.
ASHLEY: ( realizing ) So you were watching me. Question is for how long? Just tonight? Or maybe a week? Two weeks? Since I moved in?
KALE: It's not a cover
ASHLEY: So what is it, Kale? Huh? What else have you seen?
KALE: What else have I seen?
ASHLEY: Yeah. What else?
KALE: Okay I've seen how you always pull your kleenex from the box in groups of three. Not two, not four, always three. I've seen you're the only one in the world who eats pizza- flavored Pringles. And you never stuff the chips in, you savor each one by dividing it into four precise bites. I didn't know that was even possible. You're also the first girl I've ever seen who spends more time on her roof than in her own house. And what do you do out there? You don't talk on the phone, you don't paint your nails, you read books. Now one would think with the whole numbers thing you've got going on that you'd put them on your shelf alphabetically, but you don't. Your system's much more perfect. The ones you like go on the bottom, the ones you love go in the middle, and the ones you need, the ones you keep going back to. well they go straight to the top next to the dream encyclopedia. You know what all this tells me? You know how things should be. The world according to Ashley. And guess what? It's a very entertaining and beautiful thing. Even when it takes a hit. When you end up in a place like this. when your parents dump their baggage on you, or just. when it seems like those curveballs are never gonna stop It sucks, but just so you know I get it.
ASHLEY: That was either the creepiest. or the sweetest thing I've ever heard.
KALE: Hey. where have you been?
ASHLEY: Hey. where have you been?
KALE: If would have gone to the flower shop, but
ASHLEY: I know.
KALE: Oh, two months, twelve days, nineteen hours give or take.
ASHLEY: .For a guy who killed his teacher.
KALE: I didn't kill my

KALE: I've gotta go.
ASHLEY: I've gotta go.
KALE: You better see this.
ASHLEY: Kale gives her the binoculars. Ashley looks over.
KALE: ( re: woman's car ) Her car. still hasn't moved.
ASHLEY: So what do you wanna do?
RONNIE: ( prelap ) You want me to do what?
KALE: Phase one, steal his code from his There's more than one phase?
RONNIE: There's more than one phase?
KALE: There's only two. Now look, his remote's in the glove compartment of his Toyota. All you have to do is pop it open and read me the switch settings. "On" or "off."
RONNIE: For the later purpose of doing what? Breaking in to his house?
KALE: No, not breaking in. We're just talking about having access to his garage so we can go in on our own time - when he's not there - to just. to get a closer look at the car, the bag
RONNIE: ( to Ashley ) All this sounds reasonable to you?
ASHLEY: I don't know about that, but
KALE: ( re: universal remote ) This is good up to thirteen digits
RONNIE: ( realizing ) How long have you been planning this?
KALE: Look, if we're gonna do this, it's gotta be now. He takes twenty-one minutes average to mow his front yard. you'll be hearing him the whole time.
ASHLEY: I'll do it.
RONNIE: ( beat; then grabbing It isn't safe. ( getting up; macho ) Let's do it.
KALE: ( into headset as needed ) Yo, you set?
KALE: Let me conference Ashley in. Ashley, you there?
KALE: ( CONTINUED ) D.J. Caruso
KALE: You okay
KALE: Dude, glove compartment, other side.

KALE: Whenever you're ready.
KALE: Just start over.
KALE: No, no
KALE: Ronnie, he's coming around.
KALE: ( trying to remain Ronnie, I am not dicking with you. The neighbor is also mowing her lawn and he's going to see you
KALE: GET IN THE CAR!!
KALE: Easy on the door.
KALE: Back seat, NOW!
RONNIE: ( practically crying ) Kale, tell my mom
KALE: Shut up, stay down and don't move.
ASHLEY: Heading up the driveway. We barely hear her introduce herself to Giles. Giles steps around to the front of the car, uneasily shakes her hand.
RONNIE: ( pissed ) Excuse me?
KALE: ( serious ) The code, did you get it?
RONNIE: You've gotta be kidding.
KALE: ( re: something O.S. ) No way.
RONNIE: ( stepping closer ) Great, Kale. She lives.
KALE: Getting her license number
RONNIE: Kale doesn't answer, still trying to get the rest of the number as Ashley enters, eyes Ronnie who gestures to Kale.
ASHLEY: Okay, case closed.
RONNIE: Try telling Inspector Clouseau that. Now he thinks he needs her license Why, Kale? It's over.
ASHLEY: Why, Kale? It's over.
KALE: "Yeah, he seemed like such a normal guy. Sure he kept to himself, but he was always nice to me." That's what they all say. That's what all the neighbors always say after the fact. Only after they've caught the guy, after he's killed thirty
ASHLEY: Okay, I think we all just need to take a breath.
KALE: ( heading out ) Fine, but what about the bumper sticker, there's still a girl missing, just. what's in the bag? ( then from O.S. ) Can anyone tell me that?
ASHLEY: Kale, why are you so
KALE: ( re: satellite poster ) Ronnie, you've seen this satellite website, right? You can find any location on earth and take a picture
RONNIE: Yeah, for a small fee
ASHLEY: Kale, what are you doing?
KALE: Trying to get to the bottom of this.
ASHLEY: ( delicately ) Kale, right now, it doesn't look that way.
KALE: What's it look like?
ASHLEY: Like you're determined to turn Giles in to who you think he is.
KALE: Not who I think.
ASHLEY: ( beat; then ) I just didn't realize you were What, crazy? Maybe I am. But maybe I'm right.
KALE: What, crazy? Maybe I am. But maybe I'm right.
ASHLEY: It's not about that, it's about What I see. What Ronnie and I are seeing right now. I see a guy who looks like he hasn't slept in I'm seeing you sitting at your dad's
KALE: Are you two gonna help me or not? I want to.
ASHLEY: I want to.
KALE: ( picks up a stack ) Then start looking through these
ASHLEY: That's not what I meant.
KALE: ( beat; then ) Well, this is all I need, so I guess I'll see you later.
RONNIE: I would, dude, but I've gotta pull it together and change my underwear. Catch you later?
KALE: Ronnie leaves. Kale sits in silence, his thoughts unreadable
KALE: Get off me, man.
RONNIE: Dude my cell phone's still in his car.
KALE: ( beat; then ) Ronnie, I know you think I'm losing my mind, but. listen, I'll help you get it, I just need you to do one thing.

KALE: Dead air. Giles' GARAGE DOOR SLAMS SHUT. RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We watch as Ronnie picks up the camera, aims it at his face. Looking terrified. The camera swings away as we see Ronnie's feet scrambling along the concrete floor and then they appear to RACE THROUGH A DOORWAY ONTO DIMLY LIT HARDWOOD FLOOR making us and Kale realize

RONNIE: Dude, I am sorry. Can we just. hug it out?
KALE: Why didn't Giles tell the cops someone broke in? I mean, he did see you, You know, let's be positive for a change. I thought he did, but maybe he didn't. Or maybe he's a nice guy afterall, and he didn't wanna make a big deal of it, you know? I mean, he's a guy, he was a kid once.

GILES: ( hard in Kale's ear ) You finally wanna be an orphan?
GILES: If you don't stop fighting me, I will gut her like a fish.
GILES: So where's the tape?
GILES: staggers to his feet and charges Kale. Kale grabs the bat, rolls around and swings up at Giles, WHACKING HIM IN THE CHEST. Giles doubles over as Kale frantically plants the bat on the floor, using it as a "cane" to pull himself back to his feet. He HOPS toward Giles, raises the bat, swings it, but Giles anticipates, grabs the bat, pulls it forward, and REVERSE JABS KALE in the face! Kale staggers back, but somehow keeps his balance and the bat. He spins around, hops to the door into.
