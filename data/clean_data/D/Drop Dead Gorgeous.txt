LORETTA: ( to candy striper ) D'ya think a nice cool mint'd help if I shoved your head up your ass? Fear sweeps over the Candy Striper - she bolts down the hall! Loretta puts an arm around Amber and starts to walk down the opposite direction.
AMBER: So, what do I say?
LORETTA: Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything - relationships, dreams - your tummy, ass and thighs - all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant - the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
AMBER: Oh my God. I'm so dead.
LORETTA: Yeah, you betcha.
ANNETTE: ( throwing mints ) Go on! Get out!
AMBER: Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant. Amber sits on the bed. Annette grabs her shirt. I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
ANNETTE: I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
AMBER: ( deep breath ) Okay. Yesterday I.I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I-I-I'm gonna quit the pageant.
ANNETTE: She hits Amber with her beer-canned hand.
AMBER: ( to camera ) Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
ANNETTE: ( to camera ) Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
AMBER: Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I- I'm not goin' through this again.
ANNETTE: You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
AMBER: Oh, c'mon. First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
ANNETTE: Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
AMBER: That's it, I'm goin'.
ANNETTE: Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you. Amber sits on the bed.
AMBER: God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
ANNETTE: ( smiling ) It's me.I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber. C'mere. I love you so much.
AMBER: I love you much. Annette hugs Amber.
LORETTA: Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
AMBER: No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
AMBER: No. She never hid the fact that my dad picked his career over us. What'd she used to say?
LORETTA: "Once a carnie, always a carnie."
AMBER: EXT. MOUNT ROSE STREET - MORNING The twin officers lean against their car.
ANNETTE: "Bad wirin'?!" Well, if that ain't the biggest crock-a-shit ever. Ooowwww-Jesus! Did K-Mart have a sale on dull needles?
CANDY STRIPER: I-I just need one more "do-over."
GLADYS: So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview.
IRIS: Okay, everybody, listen up!
GLADYS: Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like The girls put their knees together. Excuse me, Miss Penthouse Ninety- eight, put your knees together. I could drive a boat show in there. Gladys paces. Ankles together. Hands resting lightly on your laps. Good. Sit up straight. Smile!
GLADYS: All right. Number two: the judges are as nervous as you are.
JOHN: ( after long beat ) Uh, I-I guess I could answer that. Yep. We're ready. So, we should probably get the young girls in here, then. Y'know, to start the V.F.W. - BACK ROOM Tess enters, sits, then quickly remembers how to sit. Judges nervously look at their clipboards - pencils ( trouble reading ) Uh, "if you could be any tree in the woods, what kinda tree would you be?"
HAROLD: ( trouble reading ) Uh, "if you could be any tree in the woods, what kinda tree would you be?"
TESS: ( long pause ) V.F.W. - BACK ROOM - MONTAGE ON MOLLY HOWARD, seated.
MOLLY: V.F.W. - BACK ROOM - MONTAGE ON LESLIE, seated.
LESLIE: V.F.W. - BACK ROOM - MONTAGE ON MICHELLE JOHANSON, seated.
MICHELLE: A tree? I can be any tree you want. Gimme a minute. She begins vocal and facial warm-up exercises.
BECKY: One with strong roots in a community like Mount Rose, a solid Christian trunk and long leafy branches to provide shade for handicapped kids on a hot summer day.
LISA: You guys know the retard's pants are I don't want to see that.
HAROLD: "Who would you pick to be president, dead or alive?" PAN OVER to Molly Howard.
MOLLY: Uh, Emperor Hirohito.
LESLIE: Brett Favre!
BECKY: My mother, kcause she could solve world hunger with one of her blue- ribbon rhubarb pies, create world peace with one of her prayers and still find time to look beautiful.for my dad, Lester Leeman.
JOHN: D-do you like to swim? The other judges look at him, then at their clipboards trying to find this question.
LISA: Oh-yah, I love to swim. When I was in New York, I met Greg Louganis at one-a my brothers' shows.
JOHN: What the hell is she trying to say? Say it!
JANELLE: The ktards pants are completely off! The Judges turn and look at Hank.
HAROLD: Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
HANK: Close up shop!
HAROLD: Close up shop!
ON HAROLD: You Amber Atkins?
HAROLD: You Amber Atkins?
HAROLD: "Name and spell all the United States in alphabetical order." PAN OVER to a stunned Amber.
AMBER: HAROLD ( O.S. ) Amber can't believe what she's hearing.
AMBER: Well, ah.Alabama. A-L-A-B-A-M-A. Alaska. A-L-A-S-K-A. Arizona. A-R-I-
AMBER: West Virginia. W-E-S-T-V-I-R-G-N-I-A. Wisconsin. W-I-S-C-O-N-S-O-N. Wyoming. W-Y-O-M-I-N-G. Pan over to Judges. They can't believe it. Hank CLAPS retardedly. He loves her.
HAROLD: ( looking at others ) Uh-okay, then.
MARY: With two weeks until the pageant. I was practicing my talent. Finishing my costume, brushing up on current events, and running eighteen miles a day on about four hundred calories. I was ready. The nurse gives her a hit of oxygen. Mary smiles and gives a THUMBS UP from behind the oxygen mask.
IRIS: Coupla things.Gladys wants to be sure we go in show order today. All right? So very important. Don't forget that.
LESLIE: ( unusually serious ) Oh-yah, really nervous. It's been about two months. I haven't told my boyfriend yet. How did you know?
LESLIE: ( suddenly perky ) Oh! Nervous about the pageant! Yah She kisses a photo and GIGGLES.
BECKY: There are eight thousand sequins and fifteen hundred beads on the skirt, alone. My mom and Mrs. Lopez make it. She's one of my father's many Mexican ( Me'hee'kan ) workers he lifts from the poverty they know in Mexico ( Me'heek'koe ).
AMBER: Yah-my ma's clothes all melted onto mine forming like this big polyester meteor in our closet, y'know? But, in some kinda weird miracle, our neighbor boy, Kenny Johanson, found my tap costume on the roof-a their trailer while he was settin' coon traps for his dad. Here's the weird part. It was still on the hanger.
TESS: And, uh, this is my lucky bolt. They think it fell from a DC-10. The doctor said I was lucky the flat side hit me, um, otherwise it coulda gone right through my head. I know, I know, gives me the willies, too. I guess the explosion. Janelle Betz, wearing a flowing, nymph-like dress with ballet slippers, glides up to Amber.
JANELLE: ( slow, due to signing ) Amber? Can we switch numbers? I need to go first. ( smiling to camera ) My cousin just had a deaf baby and I get to go see it!
AMBER: Yah-sure, eight's my luck number anyway. Diane Sawyer was number eight at her local.
JANELLE: Thank you.
GLADYS: ( loud whisper ) I'll be honest. This is a hard time for me. This is the part of the pageant when you realize that tomorrow night, all but one of these girls will walk out of here a loser. It's hard for me to know how that must feel, but I'm sure it doesn't feel good. In b.g., a BIG STAGE LIGHT FALLS on Janelle's head. CRASH! Gladys and CAMERA rush the stage. "Through the Eyes of Love" continues throughout.
AMBER: Don't you get it? I was supposed to go first. I was contestant number one. That light was meant for my head. If Janelle hadn't wanted to change numbers. God, I owe my life to that deaf baby. Loretta enters, portable phone and drink in hand.
LORETTA: That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
AMBER: ( taking drink ) Really, Loretta?
LORETTA: ( avoiding eye contact ) My mom wanted me to have this?
AMBER: My mom wanted me to have this?
LORETTA: Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
AMBER: Loretta, never have kids.
LORETTA: Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still Loretta pulls a bag out of a closet and hands it to Here, your ma did want you to have this since your other one got toasted and all. Amber pulls out an ELEGANT GREEN GOWN.
AMBER: Oh.my.God! It's just like Diane Sawyer's! kCourse it's not a size ten, Diane was a little hippy back then. Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! She hugs Loretta.
CLOSE ON: Mr. and Mrs. Howard and their daughter Tina, who's embarrassed and continues to rant as they pass. All three wear T-shirts with MOLLY'S FACE on them.
MR. HOWARD: MRS. HOWARD Go Molly! Go! Number one daughter! Behind them Leslie Miller's boyfriend, PAT, and a group of ROWDY GUYS approach.
MRS. HOWARD: Go Molly! Go! Number one daughter! Behind them Leslie Miller's boyfriend, PAT, and a group of ROWDY GUYS approach.
PAT: Whooo! Leslie kicks Teen Princess ass! Go Muskies!
GLADYS: Welcome, welcome. Okay, alright, now. Is this for me or the gown? Laughter and applause trail off. Welcome to the Mount Rose American Teen Princess Pageant. While every contestant you'll meet tonight is special and unique, they all have one thing in common. They're all "Proud - to - be - an - American!" Wild applause! Jazzy patriotic medley tape. Gym doors fly open and like a Felliniesque Vegas review, CONTESTANTS enter wearing gowns and U.S. Monument Headdresses. They struggle to maintain balance as they dance, moving only their arms, on stage.
BECKY: I chose Mount Rushmore, because to live in a country where you can take an ugly old mountain and put faces on it, faces of great Americans, who did so much to make our country super great, well that makes me - Rebecca Leeman - PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!
LISA: Living in a country where Lady Liberty keeps her flame burning bright. She reaches up with a lighter to light the candle. It's hard to reach and won't light. Keeps her flame burning bright.
LESLIE: The Washington Monument. Guys WHOOP and CHEER O.S. ..makes me, Leslie Miller, proud to be an American.
AMBER: Living in a country where no matter who you are or where you come from, you can grow up and become what you've always dreamed of, makes me, Amber Atkins, proud to be an American!
MOLLY: Atomic power makes me, Molly Howard, proud to be an Asian-American. As she steps away from the mic, Tess Weinhaus, wearing a huge ball of twine headdress, dances up to the mic.
TESS: Uh, this, uh, my Uncle Phil's World's Largest Ball of Twine, in Bundy Minnesota, makes me, um, it makes me proud I'm American - I kinda misunderstood the assignment. The ball of twine falls to the floor and rolls off the stage, still attached at one end to her head.
IRIS: Okay, okay! Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal. Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine.
AMBER: Oh my God! My-my tap costume's gone. Commotion stops. Becky continues to get ready.
IRIS: Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
AMBER: No, wait. It-it was here before the openin' number.wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it? Becky freezes, staring daggers at Amber.
BECKY: You heard me. Where is it? The other contestants slowly clear a path between them.
AMBER: You heard me. Where is it? The other contestants slowly clear a path between them.
BECKY: If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
AMBER: I just did.
BECKY: Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, kcause you're talkin' like They start to slowly circle each other - a cat fight's Oh-oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky - bring it on.
AMBER: Oh-oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky - bring it on.
BECKY: Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
AMBER: Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds. They're moving ever closer.
BECKY: If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
AMBER: ( stepping between them ) Girls! Girls!
IRIS: ( stepping between them ) Girls! Girls!
BECKY: Give me your stringy-ass hair!
AMBER: I'll get you!
BECKY: You're choking my, you fucking bitch!
IRIS: ( putting hand over camera ) Y'know, I-I don't think yous boys should, uh, should be in here while the girls are changin'.
AMBER: I hate her!
IRIS: We all do. Now let's go.
GLADYS: Yah-so how kbout a big round of applause for last year's Mount Rose American Teen Princess, in a farewell performance. Who could forget her lip- synching to "Don't Cry Out Loud," by Melissa Manchester. And here she is, Mary Johanson! Applause! Gladys exits. TAPED MUSIC "It's My Turn." A NURSE pushes MARY JOHANSON out in her wheelchair, complete with portable oxygen. Mary wears a gigantic black wig and silver gown which hangs off her boney body. She moves her lips to the words as the nurse pushes her emotionally around the stage.
IRIS: All right, why don't we take up the stepladders, all right? For the Physical Fitness number?
BECKY: ( picking up her stool ) They're wet.
LISA: Hey, my hands are stuck.
MOLLY: ( sniffing ) Uh, I'm kinda dizzy from the fumes.
IRIS: Well, hold kem away from you so it doesn't get on the outfits. What kinda mental retard paints step ladders the morning of a pageant.
ON STAGE: Hank is being pulled off stage by Harold. Gladys adjusts her dress, frazzled.
HANK: ( under throughout ) Here come the judge - pinch, pinch - here come the judge - pinch, pinch - here come the judge.
GLADYS: Get back! Get back, you total retard!
LORETTA: Go Hank!
GLADYS: I'm okay, I'm okay - dress is fine. I'm okay.well, our other judges are Jean Kangas and John Dough.
CHLORIS: ( loud whisper ) Opening number looked, uh, good. Solid. But now you're gonna have to actually dance, so. ( holds up jar of Vaseline ) Here. Put a dab of this on the old choppers, ladies. It'll help you smile. And when they're lookin' at your teeth - God willin' - they won't be lookin at your feet. Chloris gives Amber the jar and exits. From the gym, we hear TAPED PATRIOTIC MUSIC. Contestants CHEER and run "PHYSICAL FITNESS" ROUTINE - PATRIOTIC MUSIC As cuts of patriotic dance moves progress, the girls have more and more red, white and blue paint smeared on their clothes, arms and legs. Amber's clearly the best. Taped music ENDS. Contestants, covered with paint, strike a final pose - sitting on ladders, standing, kneeling. Applause.
BECKY: Hurry up.
LESLIE: Okay, guys, I think we all got some. You just take it off.
AMBER: Here, I didn't get any.
LESLIE: Here, have some.
MICHELLE: Hand me another white one.
LISA: Listen, you guys, don't go int the bathroom. Tess blew chunks all over. Man, she ate a big dinner.
BECKY: Maybe she shoulda shoved that lucky bolt down her throat for desert. Becky storms off.
AMBER: ( sotto, to other girls ) And the winner of the "Spirit" award goes to. Girls laugh quietly. Iris pulls a dazed and confused Tess - beg wet spot on her shirt - through the shot.
IRIS: ( reading from notecard ) "I'd like to take you back seventeen years, when a peanut farmer was in the White House, a group-a boys callin' themselves kQueen' topped the record charts and Gladys Leeman was Gladys Wood and she was Mount Rose American Teen Princess!" Gladys enters wearing sash, tiara and plaid culottes. Applause. A SLIDE is shown of her at 17.
GLADYS: ( taking mic ) Thank you, thank you. You know, I won the talent contest by sewing these culottes, Butterick pattern 7-4-3-2. Can you believe it? They still fit!
LORETTA: She had a big ass then, she's got a big ass now.
GLADYS: ( pausing for applause ) Thank you, thank you. Our next eontestant is ready, so let's welcome her: Tess Weinhaus! APPLAUSE. Tess is pushed on stage.
TESS: ( in the b.g. throughout ) The beagle is known for it's howl. "Aaauuuuuhhhh." The Pekinese has it's own distinctive bark. "Yip, yip, yip." Not to be confused with the Chihuahua's, "Yap, yap, yap." But none can compare to the greatest bark of all - the German Shepherd.
AMBER: ( to camera, loud whisper ) .Yah-it's just gone. ( eyes welling up ) I mean, I-I just wanna tap, y'know? I'm not sayin' I'm the best, or that I'd even win, but shouldn't I at least get a chance to compete? ( starting to sob ) I just wanted my Mom to see me dance. CHLORIS KLINGHAGEN enters, small bag in hand.
CHLORIS: ( loud whisper ) Amber - Amber, c'mere.
AMBER: Please, Mrs. K, I got so much Vaseline on my teeth, I'm gonna be smilin' for a year.
CHLORIS: No. Here. Chloris pulls a simple BLACK LEOTARD from the bag. It's nothin' special, but talent like yours doesn't need to hide behind Mrs. K
AMBER: Mrs. K
CHLORIS: You're. you're special and. Ah hell, go out there and kick some Leeman ass. Amber, overcome with joy, gives her a big hug. Not so hard, sweetie. I heard somethin' snap.
LESLIE: Roll him over Lay him flat Pin his shoulders To the mat Roll him over, lay him flat, pin his shoulders, to the mat! Yeahhhh! She JUMPS, KICKS and ends with SPLITS. APPLAUSE!
MICHELLE: ( without emotion ) Fade in.Earth. The year is two- thousand twenty-four. The question on everyone's mind: What is.Soylent She sweeps her hand back across her face and she's "in character," pained, near death, and overly dramatic.
AMBER: ( loud whisper ) Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
IRIS: Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
AMBER: But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
IRIS: Sorry. I-I don't make the rules.
AMBER: This, this. This is bullshit!
IRIS: Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
AMBER: Good, kcause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant - it's, it's Nazi Germany! Amber storms off.
IRIS: ( shaking head ) Where do they get this stuff.
AMBER: Mrs. Leeman?
GLADYS: ( turning ) I-I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
AMBER: I-I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
GLADYS: Oh really - I don't think so. Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this. This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
AMBER: But, you - I mean. It's not my fault. I-I. Please? I didn't do anything wrong. Amber starts to cry.
MICHELLE: ( climaxing ) That's why. I must say. ( raising arm upward ) Soylent Green. is. people. She doubles over. She's given it all. APPLAUSE.
GLADYS: Oops, that's my cue. Gladys starts out on stage as Molly Howard, dressed like a red, white and blue cowboy, runs up next to Amber. She's twirling toy guns on her fingers.
MOLLY: Wish me luck.
AMBER: ( drying her eyes ) Good luck, Molly. One of Molly's guns flies off her finger. She goes to retrieve it.
GLADYS: Thank you, Molly.
LISA: ( arm around Amber ) Oh, Amber.
AMBER: ( can't catch breath ) I-I-I-I-I-, j-uh-j-uh-just wanted to I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't. Getting an idea, Lisa starts to take off her jacket. Amber? Here.
LISA: I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't. Getting an idea, Lisa starts to take off her jacket. Amber? Here.
AMBER: ( still sobbing ) "Here," wh-wh-what?
LISA: My jacket. Take it kcause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
MICHELLE: Oh man, Lisa, I wouldn't do this.
LESLIE: ( to Lisa ) They're never gonna let you perform naked. I asked.
LISA: Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than Your parents'd kill you.
AMBER: Your parents'd kill you.
LISA: Oh c'mon, I love kem, but you know they only had me kcause Peter needed a Lis, I want to, I really do, but. Oh, I can't.
AMBER: Lis, I want to, I really do, but. Oh, I can't.
LISA: Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
AMBER: Amber hugs her and takes the jacket.
LISA: Amber hugs her and takes the jacket.
GLADYS: Now, it's with overwhelming pride that I introduce contestant number six, who also happens to be president of her class - two years running - a member of the honor roll and the new President of the Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club - Rebecca Ann Leeman! STAGE GOES BLACK. SPOT HITS BECKY, who sits at the edge of the stage, holding a mic. She's head to toe sequins in her poodle skirt, sweater, saddle shoes, etc.
BECKY: ( talking over music ) I don't know how many of you know this, but I've got a very special fella in my life - that's right, I do. And if nobody minds, I'd like to sing a little song, just for him. SPOT FOLLOWS as Becky stands and walks center stage to what appears to be a COVERED MANNEQUIN. TAPED INTRO TO "I Can't Take My Eyes Off You." You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you. You'd be like Heaven to touch. I wanna hold you so much. At long last love has arrived and I thank God I'm alive. Becky removes the sheet, revealing a MANNEQUIN dressed like JESUS as he appeared on the cross: long hair, beard, crown of thorns, loincloth. The ARMS ARE STUFFED so they move freely. ( Hands of stigmata. ) You're just to good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you. Becky TALK-SINGS - a la William Shatner's "Rocket Man" - and DANCES around the Jesus mannequin doing the jitter- bug, the twist and a slow dance ( his arms on her shoulders ).
IRIS: C'mon, Lisa. You're up next.
LISA: I quit. And, uh, since my costume, y'know, was okay'd a month ago? I'm givin' it to Amber. Amber breaks a smile. Taped music ENDS. APPLAUSE. Gladys, mic in hand, joins Becky for a big hug.
GLADYS: Boy, I'd hate to follow that. Wow! Becky exits, pulling the wheeled Jesus behind her. Voice of an angel, that one. Iris runs self-consciously out on stage, whispers in Gladys' ear, then runs back off stage. .Uh, I was just told that contestant number seven, Lisa Swenson, has quite the pageant.
JOHN: Uh, we're gonna, y'know, compare scores and uh, figure out a-a winner. kCause we don't know the winner yet. I mean, I-I don't know who Jean and Harold picked. No idea. Did Gladys send you in here?
HANK: I know the winner! I know the winner! I know the winner!
JOHN: No you don't! Shut your goddamn mouth, you son-of-a-bitch!! Nerves shot, John suddenly LAUNCHES himself across the table at Hank.
HAROLD: Wait a second.
JOHN: You shut it! You goddamn retard! Hank freezes, then starts to wail!
HANK: Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse Hank stops crying and goes back to the bag.
HAROLD: Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse Hank stops crying and goes back to the bag.
JOHN: For fuck's sake, why didn't ya leave him with a sitter? Hank begins crying again.
HAROLD: Real nice. You know the sitter's BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM Girls, in gowns, sit in silence. Becky and Amber sit at opposite ends of the room. There's obvious tension.
LESLIE: So, anyone talk to Janelle?
AMBER: Yah-I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy. Girls ad-lib SHOCK.
TESS: She's happy?
LESLIE: Why happy? Oh the blow to her head made her Girls ad-lib "Oh, I see. Okay-then." etc. Another LONG BEAT of SILENCE follows. Becky gets up to re-touch her Oh, good Lord! What're they doin'? Lettin' the retard count votes?! Contestants stare at her in shock. Iris enters.
BECKY: ( losing it ) Oh, good Lord! What're they doin'? Lettin' the retard count votes?! Contestants stare at her in shock. Iris enters.
IRIS: It's time, ladies.
GLADYS: Welcome back, everyone. Judges. Our Second Runner-up and winner of a fifty-
GLADYS: Our next prize, a seventy-five dollar Audience ad-libs amazement. .will be awarded to the First Runner- Taped DRUM ROLL. Contestants ( except Becky ) take hands. Iris gives Gladys an envelope and trophy. And the First Runner-up is - Contestant number eight, Amber Atkins. Ad-lib audience shock and disbelief. Contestants are stunned. Amber steps forward, humbly takes the trophy and stands beside Leslie. Audience finally quiets. And finally, the moment I know I've been waiting for. Iris hands Gladys a LARGE TROPHY and envelope. Mary Johanson is wheeled out wearing sash and tiara. With a scholarship of five-hundred dollars, courtesy Leeman Furniture, and all expenses paid for next weekend when she'll be competin' for the title of Minnesota American Teen Princess. Taped drum roll. Gladys opens the envelope. Our new Mount Rose American Teen Princess is contestant number - ah heck, she's my daughter - number seven, Rebecca Ann Leeman! Polite audience applause. Becky rushes forward. Gladys RIPS the tiara and sash off Mary, places them on Becky.
BECKY: Oh, thank you so much!
AUDIENCE: Loretta and Annette watch on.
ANNETTE: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - STAGE The ELDERLY MAN/MAYOR, from earlier scene, enters and sings to a tape as Becky takes her victory walk.
ANNETTE: We was robbed.
LORETTA: Okay. Take her purse.
AMBER: Bye mom.
ANNETTE: We was robbed.
AMBER: It's okay.
AMBER: Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
LORETTA: Thank God for bunge cords.
AMBER: ( tearing up ) .Yah-well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me. ( crying ) I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer. Loretta puts her arm around Amber. They walk off as Leslie and Pat approach.
LESLIE: Hey-hey, I'm Second Runner-up! Whooo! I got second place!
PAT: Lisa passes by with her parents. They look pissed.
LESLIE: Lisa passes by with her parents. They look pissed.
LISA: No, it was worth it. Amber shoulda I'll tell ya one thing. Peter never woulda pulled a shenanigan like that.
LISA'S FATHER: I'll tell ya one thing. Peter never woulda pulled a shenanigan like that.
LISA: Well, y'know what, dad? Y'know what? Peter's gay! She runs off. Her parents stop DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS.
LISA'S FATHER: DISSOLVE TO: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOM - NIGHT CLOSE ON BECKY'S FACE. Flashes illuminate it. With each photo she changes her smile and expression. She loves PULL BACK to reveal two older men, with old-style news cameras, flash pictures.
BECKY: Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
GLADYS: She's the winner and we're going to INT. MOUNT ROSE HIGH - GIRL'S BATHROOM - DAY Fry Girl #1 and Pregnant Fry Girl smoke.
LESTER: Ahhh. Beautiful as a whore's ass today. Eh, boys? In the b.g., Gladys holds a bullhorn, clipboard and points to a LARGE SWAN FLOAT.

IRIS: We need more bars!
GLADYS: This is what?
IRIS: Enid ate a whole pan!
GLADYS: I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.

She grabs a BURNING 2X4 off a float and starts swinging At least you've got another daughter. CROWD GASPS. Then stunned SILENCE. CAMERA CIRCLES Gladys and Lester getting reaction shots of the crowd.

The COPS crew begins to mingle with the DOCUMENTARY crew.

SCOTT: Long time, no see.
PASTOR: That's why, dear Lord, it's with such great sorrow that we turn over to you a young woman whose dream of ridin' on a giant swan brought about her untimely death. Maybe it's your way of telling us to buy American.

HOWARD JOHNSONS - STAGE AREA - DAY A DISCO BEAT POUNDS from a boom box. Mr. Melchoir, the choreographer, watches contestants move in fast-paced crisscrossing formations. Amber is among them. Miss St. Paul screws up.
MR. MELCHOIR: Remember to count, ladies. Cross on the left and arms up on eight! On the beat! On the beat! Keep on it! Keep movin' it!

In the b.g., a pageant worker passes out PINK BAGS to the contestants. All the while, TWO FAT KIDS play "Marco Polo" in the pool.
COLLEEN: ( tipsy, holding up glass ) I can sum up our entire philosophy with this glass. I look at it and say, "it's half full." Which, in the beauty pageant biz means, "Where the hell's my waiter!" She laughs hard, then spins around in her chair. ( screaming ) Stop with the fuckin' Marco-Polo before I rip your fat little heads INT.

AMBER: I don't eat shellfish. Mom always says, "Don't ever eat nothin' that can carry its house around with it - who knows the last time it's been cleaned." She should know.
MISS MINNEAPOLIS: . I've done about thirty-five pageants. I guess my most memorable one'd have to be Miss Teen America, 1995. It was in Vegas. My roommate did Adam West.

TERRY: Okay, okay, that's enough - I get it. SUDDENLY Miss Minneapolis FREEZES.
MISS MINNEAPOLIS: Oh - oh my God. I gotta go! She runs off toward the RESTROOM.
COLLEEN: ( calling after her ) Well, you're gonna have to do somethin' with those nerves before Nationals. Thirty-million people aren't gonna wait while you run to the Other waiting contestants suddenly double over, ad- libbing "oh no! oh my God!" "I'm gonna puke!" etc. More contestants grab their bellies.
