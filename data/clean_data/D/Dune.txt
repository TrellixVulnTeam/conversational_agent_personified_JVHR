REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO: We are the secret of the Universe.
REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO: We are the secret of the Universe. We know of spice...the spice called melange...the greatest treasure in the Universe. It exists on only one planet - ours Arrakis, Dune. We know of spice and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood's selective breeding plan of ninety generations to produce the Kwisatz Haderach, the one the spice will awaken.
REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO: And now the prophecy...
REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (CONT'D): He will come...the voice from the outer world, bringing the holy war, the Jihad, which will cleanse the Universe and bring us out of darkness. He will have been born of a Bene Gesserit mother.
IRULAN: Father.
EMPEROR: (quickly) A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
REVEREND MOTHER: We felt his presence.
EMPEROR: I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
REVEREND MOTHER: Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
EMPEROR: Yes?
REVEREND MOTHER: Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
EMPEROR: He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
REVEREND MOTHER: I am your Truthsayer, my lord... (sensing something outside the room) He is here, my lord.
TANKED GUILDSMEN #1: The Bene Gesserit witch must leave.
EMPEROR: Leave us.
REVEREND MOTHER: Yes, my Lord.
EMPEROR: (after she has gone) We are alone...
NAVIGATOR: We have just folded space from Ix...
EMPEROR: (extremely nervous) Yes?... How was your journey?
NAVIGATOR: (after a long pause) Many machines on Ix... new machines.
EMPEROR: Oh yes?
EMPEROR: Is there a problem?... Usually there is a problem when one of you makes a visit.
NAVIGATOR: (finally) The answer is within the problem...
NAVIGATOR: I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
EMPEROR: Yes.
NAVIGATOR: You must share with us.
NAVIGATOR: So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
EMPEROR: Yes.
NAVIGATOR: (to Reverend Mother, mentally) Reverend Mother... I will give you the Tleilaxu Path.
REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.): (an excited whisper) A chance for escape? But for whom?
EMPEROR: Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice...
NAVIGATOR: LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.): He shouldn't speak of this...
NAVIGATOR: ...gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood the metaphysical ability to see beyond...to have superior powers... Our power to fold space is in the spice... Without us, your empire would be lost on isolated scattered planets... You would be lost.
EMPEROR: I can assure you...
NAVIGATOR: Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.): Here it comes...
NAVIGATOR: We ourselves... foresee a slight problem within House Atreides.... Paul.... Paul Atreides.
EMPEROR: You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides... his father.
PAUL: (whispering) Here we are now... nineteen light years beyond...
PAUL (V.O.): (whispering) ... beyond Epsilon Alangue... is Arrakis.
PAUL: (whispering again) It does look dry....
PAUL: Where are the Harkonnens from here?
PAUL (V.O.): (whispering) There!... Geidi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen... the enemy.
PAUL: (without turning) I know, Thufir, I'm sitting with my back to the door.
PAUL (CONT'D): I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
THUFIR: Those sounds could be imitated.
PAUL: I'd know the difference.
PAUL: My father sent you to test me. Music then?
GURNEY: No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
PAUL: Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
GURNEY: (angered) Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
PAUL: I'm sorry Gurney.
GURNEY: Not sorry enough.
GURNEY: (his voice sounding strange through the forcefield) Guard yourself for true!
PAUL: (inner voice) What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking.
PAUL: (strange shielded voice) Is this what you seek?
GURNEY: (strange shielded voice) Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
GURNEY (CONT'D): We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
PAUL: Would you really have drawn my blood?
GURNEY: If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
PAUL: Things have been so serious here lately.
GURNEY: Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
PAUL: Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on the worms of Arrakis?
PAUL: Only?!
DR. YUEH: There are have been documented sightings of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert -- far from where we'll be in Arakeen.... The desert belt and the south polar regions are marked forbidden.... Why?
PAUL: The storms and the worms. Is it true, that the sand can blow at seven hundred kilometers per hour?
YUEH: It can render flesh to dust in minutes. And these dry winds can generate tremendous static electricity in the atmosphere. Our body shields won't have enough power to operate in the open air on Arrakis.
PAUL: Well, how do the Fremen survive there?
YUEH: We don't know much about the Fremen... They live in the deep desert... some of them in the cities and they have blue- within-blue eyes...
PAUL: (smiling) The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the blood by the spice -- melange. Could the spice affect us in other ways?
THUFIR: Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
PAUL: (rising) The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor.
THUFIR (CONT'D): Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
PAUL: I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
THUFIR: We have our new army. (in the same breath) Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
THUFIR (CONT'D): Clear and lock the room.
THUFIR (CONT'D): Activate a fighter.
GURNEY: (to Yueh) Precise control....
PAUL: The bull that killed my grandfather... is this an evil omen?
PAUL: (happily) Duncan!
DUNCAN: Paul. (they shake hands) I was on my way to say goodbye to you.  I have to go on ahead.
PAUL: Why?  I wish you were coming with us.
DUNCAN: It's something for your father.  He wants to talk to you. (places hand on Paul's chest) I'll see you in Arrakis.  May the hand of God be with you.
PAUL: May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan.
PAUL: (diffident) Father.
DUKE LETO: Thank you for joining me, Paul. (voice tired) It will be good to get to our new home and have all this upset behind us.
DUKE LETO (CONT'D): (inner voice) My son. (out loud) Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides three generations....  He swears you are the finest student he's ever taught. Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same.... It makes me feel very proud...
PAUL: I want you to be proud of me.
DUKE LETO: (studying the dark sea below) I'll miss the sea... but a person needs new experiences... they jar something deep inside, allowing him to grow.  Without change, something sleeps inside us... and seldom awakens... The sleeper must awaken.
PAUL (V.O.): Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.
VOICE: The second moon, your moon...
BEAUTIFUL GIRL: Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.
JESSICA: (inner voice) I  know she has come to test him... no man has ever been tested with the box... only Bene Gesserit women. I may lose my son.
PAUL: (whispering again) Arrakis... Dune... Desert planet... moving... moving.
REVEREND MOTHER: We'll salvage what we can... but I can tell you.. dear God... for the father... nothing.
REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D): Did you really think that you could bear the Kwisatz Haderach?... How dare you!
REVEREND MOTHER: My greatest student... and my greatest disappointment.... He's awake!... He's listening to us. (considering) Good... Ready yourself, young Paul Atreides... I want to see you in your mother's chamber in one quarter of an hour.
JESSICA: Paul?... This is very important...
PAUL: Kwisatz Haderach?... For the father... nothing?
JESSICA: It meant so much to him...
REVEREND MOTHER: You thought only of a Duke's desire for a son?... Desires don't figure in this! An Atreides daughter could have been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. We may lose both blood lines now.
JESSICA: I vowed never to regret my decision. I'll pay for my own mistakes.
REVEREND MOTHER: And your son will pay with you.
JESSICA: Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you... (to Reverend Mother) Please...
JESSICA: Your Reverence.
PAUL: (inner voice) What does she fear? (out loud) What about my Father?
JESSICA: Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
REVEREND MOTHER: (using The Voice) Now you come here.
PAUL: (inner voice) She's using The Voice. (out loud) No.
REVEREND MOTHER: (inner voice) Some strength there. Surprising! (out loud) Come here.
REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D): See this... Put your right hand in the box.
REVEREND MOTHER: Pain.
REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D): (The Voice) STOP! Put your hand in the box.
PAUL: (inner voice) The Voice again.
REVEREND MOTHER: I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
PAUL: Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
REVEREND MOTHER: Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
PAUL: (whispering) It burns.
PAUL: (inner voice)(struggling to compose himself) I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
REVEREND MOTHER: You feel the flesh crisping?
REVEREND MOTHER: Flesh dropping off.
PAUL: (cannot help the explosion)
REVEREND MOTHER: NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D): (explaining) Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
PAUL: I see the truth of it.
PAUL: I know it.
REVEREND MOTHER: Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
PAUL: Not all of them... I know which ones will.
REVEREND MOTHER: Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
PAUL: What is it?
REVEREND MOTHER: (profoundly) The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
PAUL: Where?
REVEREND MOTHER: Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
PAUL: I have heard of it.
PAUL: Did they try and fail?
REVEREND MOTHER: They tried and died.... (she calls out loudly) Jessica!
REVEREND MOTHER: I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
PAUL: I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
JESSICA: Paul!
PAUL: Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
REVEREND MOTHER: What can be done has been done.
PAUL: MOTHER! Tell me!
PITER: It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed - The lips acquire stains - The stains become a warning - It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
PITER: My Lord!
BARON: Piter.
PITER: The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
BARON: What does Leto say, Piter?
PITER: He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
BARON: (swallowing; angry) I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
PITER: As you instructed me, I have enlightened your nephews concerning my plan t...
PITER: The plan to crush the Atreides.  Feyd, Rabban... go quietly... no other great house of the Landsraad must ever know of the Emperor's aid to the Baron.  The entire Landsraad would turn against the Baron and the Emperor.
DOCTOR: Put the pick in there Pete And turn it round real neat.
BARON: (as the Baron watches the boy) You're so beautiful my Baron Your skin, love to me Your diseases lovingly cared for For all eternity.
BARON: I will have Arrakis back for myself... he who controls the Spice, controls the universe... and what Piter didn't tell you is we have control of someone who is very close to Duke Leto.  This person... this traitor... will be worth more to us than ten legions of Sardaukar.
FEYD: Who is the traitor?
BARON: (laughs) I won't tell you who the traitor is or when we'll attack.  However, the Duke will die before these eyes and he'll know that it is I -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who encompasses his doom.
JESSICA: (turning away) (inner voice) I must not fear.  Fear is the mind- killer... the little death that brings total obliteration...
DUKE LETO: Soon they'll begin to fold space.
PAUL: (inner voice) Far off in the control rooms.... Travelling without moving.
ATREIDES TECHNICIAN: Harkonnens.
THUFIR: (into a radio microphone) Why isn't the shield up yet?
ATREIDES RADIO MAN: We found and removed another sabotage device. I think it will go up now.
THUFIR: (inner voice; worried) We found these sabotage devices too easily...
DR. YUEH: Listen here.... You can here the people of Arrakeen outside.... Can you here the cry "Soo Soo Sook" of the water sellers?
JESSICA: So many reminders of the scarcity of water.
DR. YUEH: Have you noticed the line of palms along the wall... the Harkonnen put them in... to flaunt their water wealth in front of these people.... Each day those palms take enough water to sustain the life of one hundred men.
JESSICA: The way you say Harkonnen... I didn't know you had so much reason to hate them.
DR. YUEH: (swiftly) My wife... you didn't know my wife... they...
DR. YUEH: I'm sorry I'm unable to talk about it.
ATREIDES WOMAN #1: (referring to several robed figures standing in the room) My lady... the local people... the maids and servants await your inspection. Hawat has cleared them.
DR. YUEH: The Harkonnens may have tampered medically.... please wait.
JESSICA: (inner voice; noticing Yueh's hands) He's hiding something -- holding something back. (She studies his face closely.) It's not just his wife... He's a good man though. He's probably trying to save my feelings... (We see her mouth.) I could use The Voice... make him tell me... It would only shame him. (We see her eyes.) I must place more trust in my friends. (We see Yueh turn toward her, fearful.)
NARRATOR (V.O.): One carryall handles four spice mining teams; however, it will fly only two harvesters at a time. Today, we have nine hundred and thirty harvesters and nine hundred and eighty-one carryalls....
PAUL: (inner voice) Spice...
PAUL (CONT'D): (whispering inner voice) Terrible purpose.... What is it?
PAUL: A Fremen... Could she be the operator? No...
SHADOUT MAPES: I must cleanse the way between us.... You saved my life... and we  Fremen pay our debts. It's known to us that you've a traitor in your midst. Who it is we cannot say but we're certain of it.
PAUL: (inner voice) A traitor...
PAUL (CONT'D): (looks to Jessica) There is a traitor among us.
THUFIR: Set up a sonar probe immediately!
DUKE LETO: (on phone) Thufir?... anything?... keep looking. (Inner voice) ...and a traitor... God help us.
THUFIR (CONT'D): (very fast and casually) Eight.... Thufir Hawat... Mentat... Master of Assassins.
THUFIR (CONT'D): The Palace is now secure. The city of Arrakeen is under martial law... we have troops here headquartered underground on sub-floors six through ten. The rest of the troops are stationed in Arrakeen and we have some on the airfield. Our new army is still training, but everything is shielded.... With the shielding, we are impenetrable. Dr. Kynes is waiting, Sire, for your inspection of spice mining operations, but since the attempt of the young master, I am against your leaving the Palace.
DUKE LETO: (very angry) The attempt failed... Harkonnen captives have already been taken. We must crush the Harkonnen machine on Arrakis.... You all know what to do. (Turning towards Gurney) ...Gurney! We desperately need more spice miners... many are threatening to leave on the next shuttle. We need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men ... any with open sand experience. You must persuade them to enlist with us.
DUKE LETO: (squints at Gurney) Very moving, Gurney. On your way... and take care of Dr. Kynes until Paul and I arrive. We will not be prisoners here in this place.
GURNEY: (artfully easing the Duke's anger) Behold as a wild ass in the desert go I forth to my work.
JESSICA: (inner voice) I must speak with you Leto!
JESSICA: (staring at the blue-eyed woman -- waiting for possible danger.) Yes?
SHADOUT MAPES: I am the Shadout Mapes, your housekeeper, Noble Born. What are your orders.
JESSICA: You may refer to me as "my lady." I am not noble born. I'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto -- mother of the heir designate.... "Shadout"... that's an ancient word.
MAPES: (strangely asked) You know the ancient tongues?
JESSICA: I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
MAPES: As the legend says.
JESSICA: (inner voice) That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham. (out loud) I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
JESSICA (CONT'D): I know many things. I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice.
JESSICA: And the means of my death should I prove otherwise. (inner voice) Now we will see which way the decision tips.
MAPES: Do you know this my lady?
JESSICA: (inner voice) It could only be one thing.... (out loud) It's a crysknife.
MAPES: Say it not lightly... (very slowly) Do you know its meaning?
JESSICA: (inner voice) Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death. (out loud) It's a maker...
JESSICA (CONT'D): (inner voice) Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close... (out loud) Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
MAPES: My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
MAPES: Take the water of my life!
MAPES (CONT'D): You are ours.... You are the one.
KYNES: (to Gurney) So, this is Leto the Just...
GURNEY: (sharply) I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
KYNES: (inner voice) Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
DUKE LETO: So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
KYNES: (turning to Gurney) I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
DUKE LETO: This is my son, Paul.
PAUL: Are you a Fremen?
KYNES: I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
PAUL: (inner voice) He's hiding something.
DUKE LETO: I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
KYNES: They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
PAUL: "Your gift is a blessing of the river."
KYNES: (inner voice) The Mahdi will greet you with holy words and your gifts will be a blessing. (spoken, nonchalantly) Most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot. They mean no harm. With your permission, I will check the security of your suits.
GURNEY: (angrily) The Duke is to be addresses as...
KYNES: Basically...
GURNEY: (leaping forward to protect his Duke) Sire!
DUKE LETO: It's all right Gurney.
GURNEY: Yes, Sire.
KYNES: It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
KYNES (CONT'D): With a Fremen suit in good working order, one can sustain life for weeks, even in the deep desert.
DUKE LETO: My thanks.
KYNES: With your permission...
PAUL: No.
PAUL: No one. It... seemed the proper way.
KYNES: That it is. (inner voice) He shall know your ways as if born to them.
GURNEY: We're wasting time, Sire.
JESSICA: (inner voice) I must speak with you Leto!
KYNES: Southeast over the Shield Wall. That's where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his harvesting.
PAUL: Will we see a worm?
KYNES: Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
PAUL: Always?
KYNES: Always.
PAUL: Why do they come?
KYNES: To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them.
GURNEY: The young master is a trained Mentat, an advanced student of Prana Bindu has studied under some of the finest teachers in the Universe.
KYNES: As I said... they defend the spice sands. As to their relationship with the spice... who knows.
GURNEY: Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
KYNES: That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
DUKE LETO: Wormsign? Is it wormsign?
KYNES: (into radio, after having found the frequency) Calling Harvester Pad Nine. Wormsign! STATIC... then a voice.
VOICE: (over radio) Who calls Pad Nine?
GURNEY: (quickly) Don't mention the Duke... This is an uncoded channel.
KYNES: Unlisted flight northeast of you... wormsign on intercept course... estimated contact fifteen minutes.
VOICE: (over radio) Have sighting confirmed. Stand by for fix. Contact in sixteen minutes minus. Very precise estimate. Who is on that unlisted flight?
DUKE LETO: What happens now?
KYNES: The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire.
KYNES: They'll work until the very last minute.
VOICE: (over radio) Spotter control... no sign of the carryall... it isn't answering.
GURNEY: The worm is eight minutes away, Sire.
VOICE: (over radio) Spotter control -- give me a report by the numbers.
DUKE LETO: Damn it... Harkonnens.
DUKE LETO (CONT'D): (into microphone) We are coming down to take you off the harvester... All spotters are ordered to comply.
VOICE: (over radio) Ordered by whom?
VOICE: (over radio) Yes... yes, Sire!
DUKE LETO: How many men do you have?
VOICE: (over radio) Full crew -- twenty-six men -- but Sire, we can't leave this spice...
DUKE LETO: Damn the spice! Get out of there.
DUKE LETO: (yelling at the men) Two men in each of the spotters... You!... over here... run!!
KYNES: (to Paul and Gurney -- yelling over the noise) I can't see him yet but he's very close...
GURNEY: Come on boys... come on. (Then, to the Duke) We're going to be heavy, Sire.
KYNES: (nervous) Here he is... We've got to go.
PAUL: (inner voice as a blinding light comes and goes) Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
KYNES: (murmuring) Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
DUKE LETO: (yelling) What's that you're saying?
KYNES: Nothing.
SPICE MINER #2: Shhhhh.
PAUL: (inner voice) Liet?
KYNES: (pointing down and yelling) You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
GURNEY: Gods, what a monster.
DUKE LETO: Someone is going to pay for this... I promise.
KYNES: (inner voice -- as he studies the Duke) This Duke is more concerned over his men than the spice!  I must admit... against all better judgement... I like this Duke.
DUKE LETO: (happily) Duncan!  What have you discovered about the Fremen, Duncan -- tell me.  Why haven't we heard from you?
DUNCAN: My lord... I suspect so much.  I think they are the allies we seek... they are strong and fierce... they do not give their loyalty easily or quickly....  As you know, the Imperium has never been able to take a census of the Fremen.  Everyone thinks that there are but few -- wandering here and there in the desert.... My lord, I suspect an incredible secret has been kept on this planet... that the Fremen exist in vast numbers... vast numbers... and it is they that control Arrakis.
DUKE LETO'S VOICE: Guard.  Open the door.
DUKE LETO: Sleep well... my son.
PAUL: (struggling painfully) Father!... father... drugged...
DUKE LETO: What happened?  What? (as Mapes dies) The shield!
DUKE LETO (CONT'D): (mind racing -- struggling) Yueh! (inner voice) He's sabotaged the house generators, we're wide open.
YUEH: (with self-disgust) I've brought House Atreides down.  I've destroyed the new army's weirding modules.
DUKE LETO: (hoarse whisper) ... Why?
DUKE LETO: Refuse...
YUEH: No! -- You mustn't... for in return I will save the lives of your Paul and Jessica.
YUEH (CONT'D): For Paul...
YUEH (CONT'D): When you see the Baron, remember the tooth!  The tooth!
ATREIDES GUARD #1: The shield is down!  The shield is down!
ATREIDES GUARD CAPTAIN: Harkonnen... (turns and shouts) Get that shield up!
ATREIDES GUARD: The shield!  The shield!
TROOPERS: Long live Duke Leto!
JESSICA: (inner voice) Leto... where are you?
BARON: Goodbye, Jessica and goodbye to your sweet son....  I want to spit once on your head... just some spittle on your face -- what a luxury.
BARON (CONT'D): We were ordered to kill them... so kill them.
NEFUD: What are your orders, Piter?
PITER: Take them to the desert, as the traitor suggested and worms will destroy the evidence.  Their bodies must never be found.
PITER: (whispering to Jessica, rubbing the spittle around on her face with his hand, delicately) I'd thought of many pleasures with you. It is perhaps better that you die in the innards of a worm.  Desire clouds my reason....  That is not good... that is bad.
DUNCAN: They're on this floor somewhere....
PAUL: (seeing Duncan) Duncan!!  Duncan!!
BARON: (to Yueh - quietly) You wish now to join your wife, is that it, traitor?
YUEH: She lives?
BARON: You wish to join her... join her, then.
BARON: Take him away.
RABBAN: He was in the Palace with the Atreides... I also say he was a spy for the Emperor. (looking up to the troops) Go now!  Take him to his desert to die. Go!
JESSICA: (inner voice) Yueh's sign.  He's left a satchell.
HARKONNEN GUARD #1: I'd like to have some fun before we kill her.
HARKONNEN GUARD #2: (laughing) Of course... what did you think?
PAUL: (struggling to use The Voice) Don't touch my mother...
JESSICA: (inner voice) Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
HARKONNEN GUARD #1: Did you hear a noise from the little one?
HARKONNEN GUARD #1: No?
HARKONNEN GUARD #2: No.
JESSICA: (inner voice) The calming exercise.
HARKONNEN GUARD #1: The little one! (they laugh)
PAUL: (using The Voice) Remove her gag!
JESSICA: (inner voice) Excellent!
JESSICA (CONT'D): (The Voice) There's no need to fight over me.
HARKONNEN GUARD #1: Now?
JESSICA: (The Voice) First cut my son's bonds.
JESSICA (CONT'D): (The Voice) That's it.
JESSICA: Oh, my God!
BARON: Duke Leto Atreides.  Someone's torn the insignia off your uniform.  Such carelessness.
BARON: It was Feyd? (laughing) It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
PITER: The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
BARON: You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
DUKE LETO: (inner voice) Yueh... Yueh... dead... Paul and Jessica safe... the tooth!
PITER: He's coming round, my Lord.
DUKE LETO: (inner voice) Wait... he must be near...
BARON: Where is your ring?
BARON (CONT'D): You do not answer!
DUKE LETO: (very faint) A... little... closer....  The... water... of my life... for Paul.
DUKE LETO: Now!
JESSICA: Leto!  Leto!
JESSICA (CONT'D): (to Paul) Leto!  He's dead!  He's dead...
BARON: (screaming) I'm alive!!!  I'm alive!!!
PAUL: I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
JESSICA: Where are we do you think?
PAUL: The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock...
PAUL: Hurry!
JESSICA: Bring these satchels!
PAUL: (at doorway) Hurry -- This crashing may bring a worm.
JESSICA: (starting to cry) A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
PAUL: (inner voice)(reacting to his mother's tears) Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
PAUL (V.O.): (distorted) House Atreides is ruined. (less distorted) This moon holds my past.
PAUL (V.O.): This moon holds my future.
PAUL (V.O.): I am only a seed...
DUKE LETO (V.O.): The seed must grow.
DUKE LETO (V.O.): The sleeper must awaken.
PAUL: Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?...
PAUL: The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
JESSICA: (inner voice) Is he....?
PAUL: You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
JESSICA: (inner voice) He knows.
PAUL: You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected! (inner voice) I'm a seed. (out load) I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
PAUL: (inner voice) Father... now I have become a killer and I will continue to kill until I have avenged your death. (out loud) Father!
BARON: (very excited) Rabban!!... we're knee deep in Atreides blood!  We've gutted them.  We've gutted them! (laughs)
BARON: Rabban, Rabban...  I place you in charge of Arrakis.  It's yours to squeeze, as I promised.  I want you to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze. (massaging in rhythm) Give me spice!  Drive them into utter submission.  You must not show the slightest pity or mercy... as only you can...  Never stop! (releasing him) Go....  Show no mercy!
RABBAN: Yes, my lord Baron.
PAUL: (inner voice) Yueh's left the plans for the weirding modules.
PAUL: We have to get to that mountain of rock. We have entered the time when all will turn against us and seek our lives...
PAUL (CONT'D): It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it.
JESSICA (CONT'D): (inner voice)(as Paul leaves to light the thumper) ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
PAUL: (returning) Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
JESSICA: (puts in her noseplug) I'm ready.
PAUL: Keep going...
PAUL: Faster!!
PAUL: (screaming) Run!
JESSICA: I can't... I can't.
PAUL: Drum sand!
PAUL: (inner voice) Cinnamon... the spice! (out loud) Do you smell it?
JESSICA: Yes...
PAUL: (inner voice) I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
JESSICA: Paul!
PAUL: (inner voice) A thumper.
PAUL: (breathing heavily) Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
JESSICA: (whispering) Man-carved steps.
PAUL: (whispering) Yes...
STILGAR: Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
STILGAR: (to Jessica) Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
JESSICA: No, but many consider my training valuable.
STILGAR: I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe...
STILGAR: Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
JESSICA: Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
A FREMEN: It is the legend.
CHANI: I am Chani, daughter of Liet....  I would not have permitted you to harm my tribe.
PAUL: (inner voice) From my dream... so beautiful.  Liet.... is this Kynes' daughter?
STILGAR: (to Paul, as they meet) You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
PAUL: (thinking) What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
STILGAR: We call that one Muad'dib.
PAUL: Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
STILGAR: You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you.
CHANI (CONT'D): Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.
JESSICA: Moisture...
PAUL: Wind traps... huge ones.
PAUL: (inner voice) Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream. (out loud) A treasure.
STILGAR: Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
STILGAR (CONT'D): The Rocks of Arrakis hold many secrets.
MONK: We sense that you may be the "voice from the outer world".  Both moons told us of you.  You must pass tests before we will know... you must conquer the beast of the desert, both his outer and his deadly inner powers. (moves back) Speak to us... from the outer world.
PAUL: (inner voice) I am only a seed. (out loud) I am Usul... Paul Muad'dib.
MONK: The legend.
PAUL: (inner voice) No one ever dreamed there would be so many. (out loud) Our shared enemy the Harkonnens, are once again in control of Arrakis.  Stilgar, your leader, has asked me and my mother to crush the Harkonnens.  We must do more than this.  We must totally destroy all spice production on Arrakis.  The Guild and the entire universe depends on spice. "He who can destroy a thing, controls a thing". I will take one hundred of your warriors and train them.  This one hundred will train the thousands that remain.  When the spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to Arrakis.  The Baron and the Emperor himself will be forced to deal with us. Arrakis will become the center of the Universe. (inner voice) The dream unfolds.
PAUL: The weirding way has long been a Bene Gesserit secret.  With my mother's help, my father isolated an element of the weirding way and externalised it.
ORATO: Break!
PAUL: Move back!
PAUL: Chuksa!
100 FREMEN: Achiii!
100 FREMEN: Muad'dib!
PAUL: (inner voice) To avenge my father, I will turn you into killing machines.
STILGAR: Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
JESSICA: (inner voice) They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen. (out loud) I will try to pass within.
STILGAR: Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
JESSICA: (inner voice) I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO: (to Jessica, in an ancient voice) So you are the ones.
STILGAR: (whispering to Paul) Do you know the Water of Life?... Come... ...Watch... the mystery of mysteries... the end and the beginning.
PAUL: (inner voice) The most lethal poison in the Universe.
REVEREND MOTHER: ... Many men have tried.
PAUL: Did they try and fail?
REVEREND MOTHER: They tried and died.
MONK #1: One among us has consented to enter the rite.  She will attempt to pass within that we not lose the strength of our Reverend Mother.
PAUL: (inner voice)(turning to his mother) What if she should fail?
MONK #1: Drink!
JESSICA: (inner voice) The ultimate awareness spectrum narcotic. I must transform the poison configuration within my body... the blue must be made clean.
REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO: (whispering urgently into Jessica's ear) You should have told us.
REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (V.O.): (gasping) Great Mother!  This changes both!  What have we done?
JESSICA (V.O): (inner voice)(fearful) No!  This is the place where we cannot look.  The place only for the eyes of the Kwisatz Haderach.
JESSICA: What is this?...  Is this what kills the men who enter here?
JESSICA (V.O.)(CONT'D): (inner voice) Now my daughter and I are both Reverend Mothers.
REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (V.O.): (distant) I've been a long time waiting for you. Here is my life.
MONK: Change it that we may all drink of it.
MONK (CONT'D): It is changed!
PAUL: (inner voice) She did it!
CHANI: (whispering) Come with me.
PAUL: Chani....  I love you... I've always loved you....
BARON: (takes a drink) Feyd, even though he's aging, Thufir is one of the finest Mentats in the Universe... and he's mine, Feyd... all mine....  Quiet now.
FEYD: I will.
BARON: Oh Thufir, I see they've installed your heart plug already....  Don't be angry. Everyone gets one here.  But this is not why we're here.  We've brought you a little cat, Thufir.  You must care for it if you wish to live.  A poison has been introduced into you, Thufir Hawat.  By milking this smooth little cat body each day you receive your antidote... it must be done each day....  Also, you must do something for me if you wish to live.  You know I lost Piter, my dear Mentat...
FEYD: All I can see is an Atreides that I want to kill.
BARON: Feyd, no, no!  Thufir's a Harkonnen now, aren't you Thufir?
THUFIR: (inner voice) My dear Duke... how I have failed you.
HARAH: What will you call her?
JESSICA: Alia.
ALIA: Mother.
PAUL: Activate your weirding modules...
PAUL: Set the range for two meters.
PAUL: Korba... (points to robot) The arm...
KORBA: (aiming the module) Chuuk-sa...
PAUL: Motion... Chuuk-sa...
KORBA: Chuuuk-sa...
A FREMEN: Muad'dib!...
PAUL: (inner voice) My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
STILGAR: (to Paul as he applies red colour to the shoulders of several large Fremen men) Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
PAUL: Now!
PAIL (CONT'D): (to Stilgar) They're even better on the battlefield than in the training rooms!! (inner voice) Sound... as a weapon.  If only you could see them, father.
PAUL (CONT'D): (his V.O. from the past) When the spice flow stops, the entire Universe will turn to Arrakis.  The Baron and the Emperor himself will be forced to deal with us.
RABBAN: What happened?  What happened to you? What is he saying?
WOUNDED HARKONNEN: Muad'dib!...  Muad'dib!... Muad'dib!... Muad'dib!
A HARKONNEN SOLDIER: He's been repeating that name ever since we found him.
RABBAN: Who is this Muad'dib?
STILGAR (V.O.): Two thumpers are planted.  The worm may not surface for the first - he will rise for the second.  Remember, when the worm approaches, you must be utterly still... and close enough to plant the hook firmly under a ring segment....  The worm will turn to lift this exposed area as far from the abrasive sand as possible and it will take you with it -- to the top.  Do not get too close as he approaches... the sand will engulf you....  Wait till the head of the worm passes -- then go... quickly.
STILGAR & FREMEN: Shai-Hulud... Shai-Hulud.
PAUL: (inner voice) Only the very strong ones travel this deep....
STILGAR: (to the others) Usul has called a big one.  Again... it is the legend.
PAUL: (inner voice) A sandrider!...
PAUL: (yelling) Long live the fighters!
VOICE: Seventeen Great Houses of the Lansraad have reported a significant delay in delivery of spice per CHOAM agreement. This constitutes a serious violation of CHOAM codes.  Contact Baron Vladimir Harkonnen immediately.
RABBAN: Falsify the reports.  We can't hide it all, tell them we've lost only two hundred harvesters... and forty carryalls... and don't let my uncle know about the destruction of the spice silos....  I will catch this Muad'dib and suck the blood from him!!  SUCK THE BLOOD FROM HIM!!!
PAUL: We surprised a band of smugglers.
STILGAR: (racing into thick smoke) Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
PAUL: Gurney!...
PAUL (CONT'D): You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
GURNEY: (peering; whisper of hope) Paul!!  Paul!!
PAUL: Don't you trust your own eyes.
GURNEY: They said you were dead.  They said...
GURNEY: You young pup!  You young pup!
VOICE: Stand-by... warning... we have just received a coded threat from the Guild. Spice production is in serious jeopardy... Giedi Prime supplying false reports... Guild to visit Emperor in one standard day.
TANKED GUILDSMAN #2: Emperor Shaddam IV... You have one last chance to take matters into your own hands and bring the situation under the control on Arrakis.
EMPEROR: What do you mean one last...
TANKED GUILDSMAN #2: Do not speak!...  Listen!...  You do not have more than this one chance....  I represent the entire Guild in this matter....  You have failed to kill the Atreides heir... Paul.
EMPEROR: But he was said to...
TANKED GUILDSMEN #2: (moans like a cow) Noooooo... he is not dead.  He is not eaten by worms as you have wanted to believe.  He is not missing.  He is in the deep desert with the Fremen.  The Spice is in great danger.  We are not asking... we are telling... remedy the situation or you will live out your life in a pain amplifier.
EMPEROR: Who is this Paula Atreides to the Guild? And why?
HARAH (V.O.): ...they don't like Alia around.  She frightens them.  It is the strangeness of your daughter.
JESSICA: It's the way she speaks of things...
JESSICA (V.O.): ...beyond her years and of things no child could know -- things of the past. (pause)
JESSICA (V.O.)(CONT'D): A daughter who knew at birth everything I know...
HARAH: But Your Reverence, they won't have her around them.
ALIA: (screaming little adult voice) Harah!  Would they deny me the right to use this mind?...
JESSICA: Alia!
EMPEROR: (firmly) I want fifty legions of Sardaukar on Arrakis at once.
SARDAUKAR OFFICER #1: Fifty legions?... (he looks at the other officers with worry) That's our entire reserves as well.
EMPEROR: This is genocide...  the deliberate and systematic destruction of all life on Arrakis.
CHANI: You were calling my name... it frightened me.
PAUL: Hurry!  All I see is darkness.
CHANI: Paul... I will love you forever... in life or in death... let Shai-Hulud judge now. (whispering) You are my life.
PAUL: (inner voice) Now... the test of the water of life... what is it that waits for me in this darkness?
ALIA: Mother - help me!
JESSICA: (struggling) Alia!  What is it?
CHANI: Paul... Paul.
PAUL: Father!...  Father!  THE SLEEPER HAS
PAUL: Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.
PAUL (CONT'D): (loud) Your time has come. (inner voice) Father... our time has come. (out loud again) A storm is coming -- our storm... and when it comes it will shake the Universe. Emperor... we come for you.
PAUL: (he raises crysknife) Long live the fighters!
STILGAR: Long live the fighters!
PAUL: Gurney, when the storm hits... set off the atomics.  I want an opening through the entire Shield Wall.  Stilgar?  Do we have wormsign?
STILGAR: Usul... We have wormsign, the likes of which even God has never seen.
EMPEROR: Bring in that floating fat man... the Baron.
EMPEROR: Why have you brought me here?
BARON: Your Highness... There must be some mistake... I never requested your presence.
EMPEROR: Ah?  But your lack of action demanded it. Your dreadful mismanagement, your bad judgement in assigning to Rabban -- (he gestures toward the head) -- the governorship....  You forced me to come here and set things straight... personally.
ALIA: I am the messenger from Muad'dib.  Poor Emperor, I'm afraid my brother won't be very pleased with you.
EMPEROR: Silence!...  I do not court your brother's pleasure.
REVEREND MOTHER: (struggling, speaking) Kill this child!!  She's an abomination!! Kill her. (points to Alia, who is smiling at her) Get out of my mind!!!
ALIA: Not until you tell them both who I really am.
REVEREND MOTHER: (strained speech void of emotion) Sister of Paul Muad'dib.
EMPEROR: Paul's sister... Paul is Muad'dib?!
PAUL: (laughs)(to Gurney and Stilgar) Alia keeps pace with the storm.
PAUL: Gurney, now!
GURNEY: (they put on their hoods) Atomics!
ALIA: My brother is coming... with many Fremen warriors.
SARDAUKAR OFFICER #2: The Shield Wall is gone.
EMPEROR: Impossible!
ALIA: Not impossible.  I told you... He is here now.
SARDAUKAR OFFICER #2: Majesty, into the ship!
EMPEROR: (to his officers)(rising) Release the Sardaukar.  Baron... give this little abomination to the storm.
BARON: I have her, Majesty!
GURNEY: My Lord?
PAUL: Let him stand free!
FEYD: (to Thufir) The antidote...
GURNEY: (gestures to Thufir) Thufir.  Come.
PAUL (CONT'D): (inner voice) A knife.... (out loud) In payment of the many years of service to my family, you may know ask of me anything you wish.  Anything at all. (quietly) Do you need my life, old friend?
PAUL (CONT'D): (quiet) It is yours.
PAUL: I mean this, Thufir.  If you are to strike, do it now.
PAUL: (to the guards) Carry this noble Atreides warrior away. Do him all honor.
PAUL: Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild Heighliners above us containing many Great Houses of the Lansraad....  SEND THEM
EMPEROR: How dare you speak to me...
GUILDSMAN #2: (speaking into electric microphone) Stop your speaking!!
PAUL: (to the Guildsmen) Good.  You have some idea of what I would do but I will tell it to one who has never been seen... one who hides deep in the Heighliner control rooms.  He will hear it first.
GUILDSMEN #3: (fear) No!
PAUL (V.O.): Where are you....  Let me see you or there will be no spice.
PAUL (V.O.)(CONT'D): You know what I'm about to say is true.... I have the power to destroy the spice forever.
PAUL (CONT'D): Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
REVEREND MOTHER: Stop him, Jessica!
JESSICA: Stop him yourself.
PAUL: You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
REVEREND MOTHER: You mustn't speak of...
PAUL: (using The Voice)
PAUL (CONT'D): I remember your gom jabbar, now you remember mine.  I can kill with a word.
FEDAYKIN #1: ...and his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against the righteous.
FEYD: The righteous!
PAUL: (to Emperor) There is a Harkonnen among you.  Give the Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth.
EMPEROR: If Feyd wishes, he can meet you with my blade in his hand.
FEYD: I wish it. (steps forward)
GURNEY: This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
PAUL: The Emperor's blade.
FEYD: Why prolong the inevitable?  I will kill you!  I will kill him!
CHANI: Paul!
FEYD: (smiling) Who is the little one?  A pet, perhaps? Will she deserve my special attentions?
FEYD: (whispering) You see... your death... my blade will finish you.
FEDAYKIN #2: Usul no longer needs the weirding module.
PAUL: Now, I will tell you how it will be. Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way for an Atreides to take the throne.
EMPEROR: I sit on the throne!!
PAUL (CONT'D): (to Chani) The Princess shall have no more of me than my name... no child of mine or touch the softness of glance... nor instant of desire....  This is my promise to you... (whispering) ...my love.
JESSICA: Think on it Chani... We who carry the name of concubine... history will call us wives.
PAUL: The Fremen have the word of Muad'dib. They will have their Holy War to cleanse the Universe... they will have Arrakis... Dune... their planet.  There will be flowing water here open to the sky and rich green oases.  For the spice there will always be some desert.  There will be fierce winds and trials to toughen men. We Fremen have a saying... (he stares at the Reverend Mother) "God created Arrakis to train the faithful." One cannot go against the word of God.
ALIA: And how can this be?
ALIA (CONT'D): For... he is the Kwisatz Haderach!
