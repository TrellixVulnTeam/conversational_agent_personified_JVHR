DATE NIGHT: Written by Josh Klausner
PHIL: Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the one who told me not to mess up the precious picture piles! he gives him a long, slow kiss.
CLARA: That was nice.
PHIL: It was nice.
CLARA: Hey from now on when you change the toilet paper, could you just make sure it is out?
PHIL: ( CHUCKLES )
CLARA: Oh, believe me, we're just getting started, Phil.
PHIL: ( reaches into picture pile ) Look at this one of your Mom with me. I mean that woman can't contain her 'Love! ON the wedding picture: RUTH, Clara's,mother, stands stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle deep in a manure bin.
CLARA: ( LAUGHS )
PHIL: Man, I wish I was them. Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades as she stares at the picture. He notices.
WHAT IS: I just. when I was growing up my Mom and Dad had a picture just like this. Now they can't even acknowledge each Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.
CLARA: I just. when I was growing up my Mom and Dad had a picture just like this. Now they can't even acknowledge each Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.
PHIL: We're having kids? With an "S"?
CLARA: Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that when I'm long in the tooth.
PHIL: You'll be even hotter long toothed. Right now to be honest Clara they're a little stumpy.
CZ: ( GIGGLES
( GIGGLES: Oh really? As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat.
PHIL: wasn't the pictures.
CLARA: You know how long that took?
PHIL: We'll fix the picture piles, Clara. We've got all the time in the world. From now on everything's gonna be just about us. Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.
MOM!: The Talking Head's "Once in a Lifetime" kicks
E: OLLIE ( O.S. ) It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a T-shirt. Without saying a word, they rise out of each side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the hall and Phil to the bathroom.
CLARA: I'm coming, Ollie!
CLARA: Uh Phil?
PHIL: I need to switch. I've got an open Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but contains it.
CLARA: I need to switch. I've got an open Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but contains it.
PHIL: Yeah. Really. As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands OK, so I say today we go for the slacker look - cool yet approachable.
CLARA: Yeah. Really. As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands OK, so I say today we go for the slacker look - cool yet approachable.
PHIL: OK, so I say today we go for the slacker look - cool yet approachable.
OLLIE: Yeah, well Mom says that. Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.
PHIL: Oh. Well. that's cool too!
CLARA: Ech. Mine. She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of razor hairs and bits of toothpaste. Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.
NT. KITCHEN: Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits at the table. Phil finally notices.
PHIL: ( HOPPING UP )
OLLIE: ( HOPPING UP )
PHIL: ( HOPPING UP )
OLLIE: How about. some Captain Crunch? Phil gets an idea and writes zickly.
PHIL: ( DISTRACTED )
OL: Captain Crunch?The cereal?
PHIL: Uh. yeah. Sure. Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed in a suit, comes into the room and spots it.
CLARA: Ah ah ah. what's that Ollie? You had a bowl yesterday.
IE: But Dad already said yeah sure. Clara glances at Phil. said it. I said it
ARCASTIC ): ( MORE ) PHIL ( CONT'D )
CLARA: ( CORRECTING HIM )
PHIL: One bowl a day a week. Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already in Phil's hand. Phil shakes the carton at Ollie.
CLARA: ( CHUCKLES )
PHIL: ( SHRUGS )
CLARA: Did you get his lunch together?
PHIL: Oh. Whoops.
CLARA: ( SIGHS )
PHIL: Sorry I dropped the ball. It's this Quarterly Report to Mr. Rivers today. You know how he freaks me out with all of his mixed animal metaphors that I don't
CLARA: ( focusing on Ollie's lunch ) Ollie, do you want a banana?
PHIL: Did you hear me?
CLARA: ( not looking at him ) Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed animal metaphors that you don't understand. Banana Ollie?
PHIL: ( BEAT )
CLARA: OK. Have a good day. Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly kisses Phil on the cheek.
PHIL: Sorry for the milky mouth. He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1ï¿½1 dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink, then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her head, she tosses the carton in the trash.
PHIL: Yes we are! ( under his breath ) ike you say to me every morning. Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara' car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING STUCK halfway.
E: Clara and JANE, another sharply dressed realtor in her 30's, walk down the street putting up OPEN HOUSE ARROW SIGNS on the sidewalk.
JANE: His name's Juan and he's some kind of Spanish, I think. He knows all these exclusive, underground places downtown. It's so exciting. And in bed.
CLARA: Too much information, Jane.
CLARA: Good for you, Jane. Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge, kicki the side and silencing it.
JANE: There's this g-eat restaurant downtown we went to the ot__ar night that you guys would love. _"st amazing view of the city. You guys should check it out on your next date night.
CLARA: ( focusing on stapling ) Yeah, well, maybe. We don't really have those that much anymore.
JANE: 't have date nights:
CLARA: ( shrugs ), You know, we're pretty tired all the time between work and Ollie. And some of the shows on TV these days are really great. Ah. I see.
1Ï¿½1: They staple in silence for a second. Jane and Clara look at each other.
CLAM: I know that's really lame.
JANE: So it's Phil?
CLARA: ( SIGHS )
JANE: So why don't you change it? All you have to do is stir things up and have one great, sexy, exciting night again.
CLARA: I guess. Maybe.
JANE: Not maybe. Tonight.
CLARA: Nah. Tonight's no good.
Â¢: Why not? Seriously think about it. What's really gonna be more important tonight than that? Clara takes this in. Jane's right.
JANE: Why not? Seriously think about it. What's really gonna be more important tonight than that? Clara takes this in. Jane's right.
PHIL: I'm sorry I'm late. The construction on the highways is insane these days!
MR. RIVERS: Don't worry about it, Phil. It's fine. Catch your breath. George gives Mr. Rivers an ornate, pal-sy handshake, then heads out with the binder, nodding at Phil. Phil nods back warily, then takes out his binder, ready to launch into his report.
PHIL: ( beat, trying to decipher ) Uh. OK. You mean. take the fund in a more high risk direction?
Â¢: MR. RIVERS OK. The thing is Phil, tomorrow I want George to give me his thoughts on where we need to be hunting too.
MR. RIVERS: ( CLEARS THROAT )
PHIL: MR. RIVERS s nothing personal.
MR. RIVERS: s nothing personal.
MR. RIVERS: I wouldn't put it like that. I Just need our pack leader to be more like. like a momma kangaroo. Ya get me?
PHIL: ( BEAT )
MR. RIVERS: The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth and knows its momma's teat is just always there, ready to suckle. But at the same time, momma kangaroo's still a wild, dangerous creature.
PHIL: Sorry. Still not totally getting you.
MR. RIVERS: I've had a wife and a family. Three of them. It's hard to stay the fastest cheetah when you need to mind the pack, Phil. George lives in the city, doesn't have a family to worry about. He can rip the meat.
PHIL: Listen, Mr. Rivers. I don't need to. I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat and eating them like tartare when George was still. in the jungle!
MR. RIVERS: ( BEAT )
PHIL: I can't be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just MR. RIVERS Listen, nothing's set. It's just I gotta say that lately your leadership on this has felt a little. well. tame.
MR. RIVERS: Listen, nothing's set. It's just I gotta say that lately your leadership on this has felt a little. well. tame.
PHIL: ( GETTING UP )

PHIL: Listen. any other night.
CLARA: OK. Maybe another time. Let me just get out of this and call my Mom then. As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks after her, feeling terrible. About to leave, he notices that around the room, Clara's SET UP CANDLES in anticipation of their romantic night. He looks down again at the papers in his hand and sucks in, conflicted.
PHIL: That dress really wasn't playing fair, With a smile, Clara watches Phil tie his tie.

She rummages and quickly WHIPS OUT her MINI 409 SPRAY, spritzing Frank right in the eyes. With a shriek, he falls back grabbing his face and dropping his gun. Clara makes a dash and grabs it. As Frank blindly lunges after her, she KNEES HIM IN THE BALLS. He collapses on the ground, whimpering in pain. She spins and points the gun at Drop the gun and the keys.

PHIL: UGS )
CLARA: UGS )
UGS ): I just think we might have made it on time if we stayed on the highway. Your shortcuts end up being long cuts most o the time.
CLARA: You can tell him.
PHIL: Because you always interrupt me when I try to tell stories, and every time you do it disrupts my flow.
CLARA: Fine, you tell it. I won't say another See, now I've totally lost where I was.
PHIL: ( BEAT )
PHIT: Yeah. Even using my shortcut which, by the way, was a shortcut - and they gave away our reservation. So we were at the bar and the host was calling out for these other people over and over-
CLARA: Which is what they do right before they cancel a reservation anyway.
PHIL: I thought you said you weren't going to interrupt me, Clara.
C: I just want him to understand we weren't really "stealing" someone else's
RESERVATI: Across the table, the Young Police officer, eyebrows raised, watches Phil and Clara volley back and forth.
PHIL: Do you think he really cares, Clara? were just kidnapped, CHLOROFORMED and almost shot! I don't think he's going turn around and book us for reservation theft! Am I right?
PHIL: So all of a sudden Clara yells out that we're these other people.
YOUNG POLICEMAN: ( SURPRISED )
PHIL: Yeah. I know! Even the guy on the speakerphone couldn't believe it!
CLARA: You two kinda bonded over that, didn't We didn't "bond" over it. I'm just saying, speakerphone guy obviously thought it was weird to do.
PHIL: We didn't "bond" over it. I'm just saying, speakerphone guy obviously thought it was weird to do.
CLARA: ( IGNORING HIM )
YOUNG POLICEMAN: You're new "buddy."
PHIL: Oh c'mon! And we found out speakerphone guy's name, Phil. It's Mr. Stockton. The Young Policeman looks up, interested.
OF FTCER: Mr. Stockton? Hold on a minute. The Officer dials an extension on the phone.
E: Wait. So you already know about this guy? You know who he is? A knock at the door and a handsome man in his late 40's, LIEUTENANT MANNING, enters the room with a smile. He reaches over and shakes their hands.

LIEUTENANT MANNING: Guys. you've obviously been through something traumatic tonight. Thankfully it's over and you're both safe and sound. Maybe you should cut each other a little bit more of a break. Phil and Clara look at each other, each letting out air. Manning's right.
PHIL: Seriously, Clara. You tell him.
CJ __: Well, we never a. t_::ally "met" CLARA ( CONT`B ) He was in another room on a speakerphone where these guys who kidnapped us took us. But he was obviously the one pulling the strings.
PHIL: Who is this Stockton guy anyway?
CLARA: Honestly, you wouldn't believe this, but it's because we sat down at the wrong table tonight for dinner.
LIEUTENANT MANNING: ( looks up, interest Really? The wrong table?
CLARA: We pretended to be someone else who didn't show up for their reservations. My idea. And it turned out that these people must have something this Mr. Stockton wants.

LIEUTENANT MANNING: Uh huh. I know you don't. It will be contained. Right now. Hanging up the phone, Manning walks quickly back through the police station to the interview room. He stops in the doorway. .it's EMPTY. Confused, he turns to an OFFICER outside at the desk.
LIEUTENANT MANNING: ( CONT'D )
OFFICER: They said you were done with them. Manning walks quickly back to his office. Sitting behind his desk, Manning enters a password on his computer and starts typing out an ALL POINTS BULLETIN. We are CLOSE UP on the computer screen as the words come

CLARA: And she of you. As it comes out of her mouth, Clara realizes and guiltily looks over at Phil BRISTLING. Holbrooke goes to a pile of already used sheets of paper and picks one up along with a pen.
HOLBROOKE: I'll just need your full names and your socials so I can get the paperwork started at the bureau. Not yours, Clara. Know that by heart. Both Phil and Clara are taken aback.

SHADOWY GUY: FBI BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER Holbrooke uses a KEYCARD on his keychain with a flourish to enter the rear of the building, then leads Phil and Clara through the doors. Suddenly he stops and Phil and Clara FREEZE behind them. At the other end of the hallway, an FBI UNIT in bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of them. AGENT #1 in the center, obviously the agent in charge, yells to them.
AGENT: Continue slowly down the hallway. sudden movements. Are they armed, What the hell's going o

PHIL: crooked cop did it! It's a lie!
CLARA: crooked cop did it! It's a lie!
AGENT #1: It's your booking, Peterson. We're Just here to back you up. Holbrooke looks nervously between the Agents and Phil and Clara. He turns to them, taking Clara's arm.

AGENT #3: You just gonna take that, Peterson?
HOLBROOKE: ( PRESSURED )
PHIL: All right! Nobody move or he gets it! Clara's STUNNED. The Agents look at each other, but don't seem overly concerned.
AGENT #1: Holbrooke has a gun? Why does he even â¢ have a gun?
HOLBROOKE: ( TO PHIL )
AGENT #3: You think it's even loaded?
HOLBROOKE: ( FREAKED )
PHIL: I'm not screwing around!
HOLBROOKE: He's not screwing around! He's not screwing around! Pulling a terrified Holbrooke, Phil and Clara back toward the rear exit of the building. They try the door, but it's locked.
1Ï¿½1: A FEW FBI AGENTS He wants your keycard.
PHIL: A FEW FBI AGENTS He wants your keycard.
HOLBROOKE: A FEW FBI AGENTS He wants your keycard.
PHIL: Thanks. He and I, the communication isn't great. Getting the keychain from Holbrooke, Phil uses the keycard then lets it fall to the floor as the door unlocks and they back outside.
HOLBROOKE: Seriously, Phil. I'm a bad shield. I Wow, Phil! Phil feels a little pumped up with Clara's praise.
CLARA: Wow, Phil! Phil feels a little pumped up with Clara's praise.
PHIL: Just give me your car keys, Holbrooke. When we're about to drive off we'll let you go.
HOLBROOKE: Uh, they were on the keychain.

PHIL: CL AA
CL AA: we'll never outrun them.
HOLBROOKE: YOW! Man is that loud! As the Agents run toward the door, Clara quickly grabs the gun from Phil and shoots, nailing the lock.
AH!: YOW! Man is that loud! As the Agents run toward the door, Clara quickly grabs the gun from Phil and shoots, nailing the lock.
PHIL: YOW! Man is that loud! As the Agents run toward the door, Clara quickly grabs the gun from Phil and shoots, nailing the lock.
CLARA: gotta get going! Quick!
PHIL: They both look around, unsure.
HOLBROOKE: Across the bridge a few blocks down that street there's an entrance to the Green Line subway. Get on it and you can get anywhere in this city. Phil and Clara look at him, confused.
PHIL: Aren't you supposed to be our hostage?
HOLBROOKE: ( SIGHS )
PHIL: It wasn't so much of a drop. it was more of a. bobble.
CLARA: Yeah, a bobble's bad.
HOLBROOKE: Listen, if you just leave me here I can tell them you ran the other way. It'll buy you time to get there. And maybe I can work on clearing all this up for you. Phil and Clara look at each other, then start to run away. Suddenly Phil stops, thinking.
CLARA: Let me have the gun. As Clara gives it to him, Phil quickly runs back and hands it to Holbrooke
PHIL: Let me have the gun. As Clara gives it to him, Phil quickly runs back and hands it to Holbrooke
HOLBROOKE: Thanks, Phil. As Phil runs back, Clara takes in the nice gesture of EXT RIDGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER A lit up raucous PARTY BOAT in a canal starts to pass under a roadway bridge up ahead as Phil and Clara, trying to stay in the shadows, walk quickly toward it. Phil glances back over their shoulders - the road is DESERTED.
PHIL: it's just on the other side of that bridge. I think we're going to make it. He notices Clara looking at him.
CLARA: Nothing. That was just nice of you, back This is crazy, but you know what I'm, reminded of right now?
PHIL: Bourne identity?
CLARA: I'm talking about right now. When we used to walk home late at night after going downtown to the clubs. We couldn't ever find a cab, remember? We'd grab those "healthy" dogs and cheese fries at the Weiner's Circle and go to the Adler Planetarium to watch the sunrise.
PHIL: Where I held your hand for the first I can't believe we used to stay up all night like that.
CLARA: I can't believe we used to stay up all night like that.
PHIL: It's because we could sleep 'til noon.
CLARA: ( SMILES SLYLY )
PHIL: I just don't understand when we got so. I don't know.
CLARA: No, I was thinking numb. When did we become one of those couples that we used to look at in restaurants back then and think were so sad?
PHIL: No, I was thinking numb. When did we become one of those couples that we used to look at in restaurants back then and think were so sad?
CLARA: We're not that bad, Phil. I just think we haven't been that honest with each other Phil doesn't understa
PHIL: It's not that I don't want another kid, Clara. It's just. I used to be the whole pie with you. And now with Ollie and your work, I'm barely even a piece of the pie anymore. I'm, like, maybe a pecan on a piece of the pie! So part of me's not jumping at the chance of having the little pecan I have left of your attention going into some new baby's But that's crazy, Phil. When you're home you're the one who seems like your hardly even there! It's all about your work. Believe me, if you- Clara suddenly notices a POLICE CAR, lights off, drive past them over the bridge.
CLARA: But that's crazy, Phil. When you're home you're the one who seems like your hardly even there! It's all about your work. Believe me, if you- Clara suddenly notices a POLICE CAR, lights off, drive past them over the bridge.
PHIL: I think we're OK. Just play cool and keep walking. The patrol car continues across and down the street. 1ï¿½1 Phil and Clara breathe a sigh of relief. Then suddenly, a few blocks down, BRAKE LIGHTS. The patrol car turns around and TURNS ON ITS LIGHTS, zooming back toward them.
CLARA: What u high? No way. But looking main at the patrol car speeding toward them, Phil grabs Clara and dashes for the side of the bridge.
AH!: As she's YANKED OVER THE SIDE, Clara CLUTCHES onto the railing. With Phil hanging onto her other arm, they DANGLE above the water and the boat.
1Ï¿½1: As she's YANKED OVER THE SIDE, Clara CLUTCHES onto the railing. With Phil hanging onto her other arm, they DANGLE above the water and the boat.
PHIL: Let go, Clara!
CLARA: A GROUP of DRUNKEN PARTIERS on the boat, spotting them, cheer below. Some even take FLASH PICTURES. Phil looks down - if they don't let go soon they're literally going to miss the boat.
PHIL: go or I'm going to tickle you!
CLARA: ( DEAD SERIOUS ) CLARA ( CONT'D ) ( LAUGHING )
E: CLARA ( CONT'D ) ( LAUGHING )
PHIL: Ow! I think I broke my butt.
CLARA: OW! OW! Dammit, Phil! What's our rule about tickling?
PHIL: I'm sorry! I didn't do it for pleasure! What is our rule?
PHIL: ( BLANDLY RECITES )
CLARA: Right! And guess what? It wasn't funny for me, Phil! Clara gets up and storms off, clutching her arm. Walking down the side of the boat, she passes a MAN down on one knee in front of an EXCITED WOMAN, who nods, accepting his proposal.
PHIL: T ' s your elbow?
CL RA: ( SIGHS )
PHIL: Well, for jumping off a bridge onto a moving boat, not so bad.
CLARA: You know, we're kind of running ou Maybe we could just hide or something until this all blows over.
PHIL: Maybe we could just hide or something until this all blows over.
CLARA: What makes you think it ever wil

CLARA: ( SIGHS )
PHIL: Wait. What if we found the pictures?

CLARA: But then we'd have to find the Gales. don't know anything about them.
PHIL: ( THINKS )
CLARA: ( CATCHING ON )
PHIL: Yeah, but even so, Holbrooke said these clubs are so secret you have to know where they are and how to get in- Clara rummages through her purse and grabs her phone, dialing, then notices Phil looking out, shaking his head.
CLARA: You're not listening to me again!
PHIL: You're not listening to me again!
CLARA: "You have to know where they are and h to get in-"
PHIL: That's great. Clara wanna cracker?
C LARA: I'm calling because of what you said, Phil. I know who can help us. Clara dials the number.
PHIL: Clara turns and looks.
CLARA: Oh shoot. You know what Jane? I've actually gotta jump off right now.
LIEUTENANT MANNING: Check again. Manning pockets the camera and starts to walk away.
PARTIER: Hey! That's mine, man!
LIEUTENANT MANNING: The Partier mumbles "Asshole" as he stumbles Manning si i.s and looks out over the wa
E: EXT. STREET - LATER It's WINDY and COLD as Phil and Clara, soaked, squeak and slosh down the street. Clara, missing one heel, dumps water out of her purse as she checks her cellphone.
CLARA: Mine's totally shot too.
PHIL: You got the info from her though, right?
CLARA: Yeah, but we can't get in looking like this, Phil.
PHIL: I don't think we have a choice. Not a big shopping hour. They walk past the 24 CHICAGO FITNESS CENTER, lights blazing. Windows show machines filled with young HARDBODIES working out.

The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver's door, SCREAMS as he's THROWN ONTO THE HOOD. The conjoined cars SHIMMY SHAMMY BACKWARD, just in time to dodge the Towncar. The Black Dude scrambles for his life through the windshield into the passenger's seat next to Phil.

Phil, Clara, and the Black Dude are all WIDE EYED as the world is a SPINNING BLUR around them. Finally, they hit the other side. Getting his bearings, Phil sees the Towncar has entered the park after them. He searches where to go next, then spots something.
PHIL: Clara! Reverse it, keep it straight put your foot to the floor. Give it Clara reverses and Phil puts the car in drive and floors it. The car goes faster. faster.

Phil and Clara's car flies reverse UP ONE SIDE OF THE DIAGONAL DRAWBRIDGE. .and LANDS SPINNING IN A FLURRY OF SPARKS OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE, causing AIR BAGS to deploy all around Phil and Clara. The Black Dude spins his steering wheel, jack-knifing his Honda across the road, and PUTS ON HIS SEAT BELT. Frank and Harry's eyes go wide as Frank jams on his brakes, but the Towncar CRASHES right into the Honda. ugh his broken window, the Black Dude grins at Frank and Harry.

As Phil and Clara get halfway to the lot, ALL THE MAYOR'S CAR DOORS OPEN, and Manning, Frank, Harry, and Mr. Stockton climb out. Frank and Harry pop the trunk and grab SHEETS OF CLEAR PLASTIC. Phil's eyes go wide.
LIEUTENANT MANNING: The next one won't be a warning shot. They look over to see Manning training a gun as he and Stockton walk toward them, Harry and Frank behind with the plastic.
MR. STOCKTON: ( to Harry and Frank Let's do it over there. y and Frank quickly throw the plastic sheets down on the grass nearby.

PHIL: Which meant Stockton was probably your MR. STOCKTON Where are the pictures?
MR. STOCKTON: Where are the pictures?
PHIL: But we were still confused, because if you guys are buddies, how do you explain the Falconwood Corporation? Mr. Stockton's face blanches.

Mayor Diggs flips through the documents, taking it all
