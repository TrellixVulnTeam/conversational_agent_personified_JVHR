SUPERIMPOSED: SOUTH CHINA SEA: The dark blue waters roil and boil and foam. THUNDER CRACKS.
FINNEGAN: How we doing out there? THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see LEILA, a muscular Filipina clambering over the foredeck. She's dripping wet. Tough as nails. She turns to Finnegan and "mouths" something into her headset. Finnegan flashes her his most charming smile.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Yes, I'm very warm and dry in here, thank you for your concern. His HEADSET comes alive withe the SOUND of LEILA bitching in an unintelligible foreign tongue.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): A raise? I already pay you two bucks a day. He watches as Leila fights the WIND and SEASPRAY and dogs tight a series of hatch-latches across the foredeck.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Missed one darling. Leila turns and gives him a "jerking-off" sign with her hand.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): I love you too. The Radar Imager suddenly blinks, and goes to black. Dead. Finnegan taps on the screen. Nothing. Taps on the console. Still nothing. Simultaneously two more imagers shut down. His mouth screws tight.
PANTUCCI: (singing) " -- if not for the courage of the fearless crew -- " He tugs at the wires.
PANTUCCI (CONT'D): " -- the Minnow would be lost, the Minowwww would be lost." Finnegan's voice explodes through his headset...
FINNEGAN (V.O.): (radio filtered)
PANTUCCI!!: Unperturbed, Pantucci works at the wires.
PANTUCCI: (into radio) Can we use our indoor voice please...
FINNEGAN (V.O.): (radio filtered) I'm flying blind here God damn it! Pantucci pulls two wires from the tangle.
PANTUCCI: You trying to make me feel guilty? He begins to strip the wires with his teeth.
FINNEGAN: Guilty will be the least of what you feel when I run my rig into one of these god damn no name islands! Get me well here!
PANTUCCI: All better...
PANTUCCI (V.O.): Now tell me again...
PANTUCCI: ...why we took this job?
FINNEGAN: If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
PANTUCCI: (rote) I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care... (nervous) Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried... Pantucci notices Hanover impatiently looking at his watch again, and nods for a mass of Aussie mean and muscle named MASON to follow him up a ladder.
PANTUCCI (CONT'D): ...and some of it's coming your way. He quickly pulls out a wrench, slaps it over a bolt and tightens it down. The leak stops. He blows on the WRENCH like it's a six-shooter, then spins it at the speed of light and holsters it into his toolbelt.
HANOVER: You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
FINNEGAN: Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
HANOVER: No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
FINNEGAN: You know what they say...the classics are eternal. Hanover looks at the Topo Imager. Holding onto the rail to keep his balance as the boat slams over the choppy sea.
HANOVER: So where are we? Finnegan points to a spot in the middle of the map.
FINNEGAN: Right here...middle of nowhere...
HANOVER: And where is our point of arrival? Finnegan points to another spot on the map.
FINNEGAN: Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
HANOVER: Which question is that?
FINNEGAN: The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
HANOVER: (to Mason) Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
MASON: (attitude) I've heard a lot of stories about you mate...
FINNEGAN: All of them flattering I'm sure.
MASON: They were...but they musta been talking about another Finnegan... because the one I heard about was as rough as they came...the one I'm looking at is, well, about as current as the music.
HANOVER: Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
FINNEGAN: I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
MASON: And who's gonna make me? Finnegan looks at Mason...at the open hatchway just behind him...
FINNEGAN: The Finnegan you heard about. ...and jams the steering sticks full speed ahead. The force of acceleration tumbles Hanover into the console. Mason tumbles out the open hatchway, down the stairs behind him. As he rises, Hanover regards Finnegan for a moment. A smile flits across his face.
HANOVER: That's why we're sill around Finnegan...you and me... Nothing gets the feathers up. Business is business. Eh? Finnegan's hand finds the console. He hits a button. The first strains of Led Zepplin's WHOLE LOTTA LOVE comes roaring out of the speakers.
FINNEGAN: And the classics are eternal. Finnegan cranks the sound to the max, pulls back on both steer sticks, and holds on, as the force of acceleration hammers him into the pylon.
OLD WOMAN: He said an orchid and a beautiful woman belonged together... It was our first date. Trillian looks down to a petite old woman, dressed impeccably, delicate, frail, her beauty long faded except from her eyes. Kindness becomes her, like moonlight does the night.
OLD WOMAN (CONT'D): He said that it was the orchid I wore that made him fall in love with me...
TRILLIAN: He sounds like a real gentleman.
OLD WOMAN: The best of the best he was... This cruise was supposed to be our 60th anniversary gift to each other. He died last Spring...
TRILLIAN: I'm so sorry...
OLD WOMAN: I was going to wear one...special for him...like a memory... The Old Woman looks at the orchid. And then at Trillian.
OLD WOMAN (CONT'D): But without him here I don't know why I should. Trillian takes the orchid from her hair, and places it in the lapel of the woman's jacket.
TRILLIAN: Because an orchid and a beautiful woman belong together. The smile Trillian bestows on the old woman is loving, sincere. The moment between them is broken by the keen clear sound of a silver spoon tapping a crystal champagne flute.
CANTON (V.O.): Ladies and gentlemen... ANGLE ON: The deck where the band stops playing. Voices hush. Everyone turns to NIGEL CANTON, 65, tall, elegant, every white hair perfectly in place, impeccably turned out, with the energy, and enthusiasm of a man half his age. Canton stands at the head of the pool, in front of a wall sized aquarium, flanked by his Captain.
CANTON (CONT'D): All my life I had the dream of building the greatest pleasure ship ever to sail the seven seas... tonight, seeing all of you here...so elegant...so beautiful...so rich... The crowd roars with laughter.
CANTON (CONT'D): I realize my dream has come true...I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for making it so... Canton lifts his glass.
CANTON (CONT'D): To the Fuji Maru! Good times forever!
CROWD: Forever!! Here! Here! The crowd swells around Canton. ANGLE ON: The Captain chatting up some passengers when a woman's voice, seductive, beguiling, turns his head to...
TRILLIAN: (French) Is it true what they say about a captain and his boat. The Captain's libido rises as he gazes into Trillian's come hither eyes.
CAPTAIN: Is what true madame? Trillian takes one step closer, until her moist lips are pursed inches from the captain's.
TRILLIAN: (French) Madamoiselle...that the bigger the boat...the bigger the man... His breath catches.
CAPTAIN: It is a theory I would be glad to put to the test. Trillian draws even closer. If looks could cause a man to climax.
TRILLIAN: (French) In school, the Sisters said testing was my specialty.
PASSENGER: Captain... Driven to distraction, The Captain turns his attention for a moment to a passenger introducing his wife.
PASSENGER (CONT'D): My wife...
CAPTAIN: Enchante... ANGLE ON: Trillian, turning from the captain into the crowd. C.U. on her hand by the side of her dress. A man's wallet held surreptitiously. Her fingers open the wallet, extract a thin gold card with a black stripe. She discards the wallet, keeps the card, and disappears into the crowd.
CANTON: You wanted to see me Captain? The Captain stands next to a bank of LASER IMAGING SYSTEMS. Canton steps up. Looks down at the THERMAL RADAR IMAGER. Multi-colored LASER IMAGES.
CAPTAIN: We have a storm rising behind us... we may have to close the canopy, I hope it doesn't ruin your party.
CANTON: (self-satisfied) Ruin my party? Captain, this ship was built to withstand a typhoon. I can't imagine there's anything on the sea today that could possibly ruin my party.
PANTUCCI: (whispers) Finnegan...Finnegan... A hand falls on his shoulder, spinning him around to a fist coming right into his face.
LEILA: Gum kwa she bam dok.
FINNEGAN: It's not noise...it's genius... And then over the headset, over the Hendrix...
PANTUCCI (V.O.): Followed by the unmistakable sound of fist hitting flesh. Finnegan and Leila trade a look.
MULLIGAN: You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
VIVO: You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countries too?
MULLIGAN: What the hell does that mean?
VIVO: Like Mamooli's country...
MAMOOLI: What you talkin'? Samoa's a county!
VIVO: It's a dot on a map...
MULLIGAN: Map...no map...I don't give a shit ...they got women on Samoa, it's on the list.
HANOVER: Mr. Billy you're in the batter's box. Hanover watches calmly as BILLY, the Aborigine, cracks his fist against the side of Pantucci's head, knocking him out of Vivo's arms.
BILLY: At home we denosy the nosy. BILLY hoists Pantucci. He draws his knife under Pantucci's bloody nose.
HANOVER: We're not savage here Mr. Billy... we're professionals. Hold him...Mr. Chin... The Chinese merc steps forward, and whaps Pantucci upside the head with a cruelly accurate crescent kick. Pantucci hits the wall hard, crumbling. Chin lifts him.
HANOVER (CONT'D): Anyone else? Massive Mason steps forward.
MASON: I'll take a go and the I vote we throw the little weasel overboard...
MULLIGAN: I vote we slit his throat THEN throw him overboard... Mason raises his ham of a fist drawing his tree trunk arm back, taking dead aim at Pantucci's face. He never gets the punch off. His arm is caught from behind. He looks over his shoulder to Finnegan. Gripping his wrist. Right in his face.
FINNEGAN: ...this is not a democracy. You don't get a vote. Mason, enraged, swings with his free hand. Finnegan twists his arm sharply, sending Mason's head into the steel wall, knocking the big man senseless. The other mercenaries go to draw their weapons. Before the guns are out of holsters, Finnegan swings a spear gun into Hanover's face, an inch from his eye.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): I'll say it again for the hearing impaired... Finnegan cocks the spear. CLICK! Hanover does not blink. Everyone freezes. With his free hand Finnegan lifts Pantucci to his unsteady feet, the spear stays poised. Finnegan backs out of the room.
HANOVER: This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
FINNEGAN: 20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
HANOVER: And no questions asked.
FINNEGAN: Who asked any?
HANOVER: He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
FINNEGAN: I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indiscretion. With that Finnegan leads Pantucci out of the hold, slamming the door behind him.
PANTUCCI: Thanks... Finnegan turns his gaze to Pantucci. It makes the smaller man quiver.
FINNEGAN: You put me in that position again I'll throw you overboard myself. Finnegan stalks off. Pantucci swallows hard, knowing he means it.
CANTON (V.O.): It is an amazing stone... Trillian grits her teeth, and turns to...Canton, the Captain, and two burly Chinese security men.
CANTON (CONT'D): ...what were you planning on doing with it?
TRILLIAN: Retiring.
CANTON: Well you can still proceed with your plans then...in prison...Captain... escort the lady... Canton exits. The Captain steps forward, and removes the diamond ring from Trillian's hand.
CAPTAIN: Mademoiselle...you are not a lady. He slaps her across the face. Trillian flushes, touches the drop of blood at her lip...and decks the Captain with a vicious right cross.
TRILLIAN: And you...Monsieur...you are not a gentleman.
PANTUCCI: Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit squad.
FINNEGAN: I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones... He carefully threads the surgical needle.
PANTUCCI: Right now...there's some bozo sitting on his yacht at those coordinates they gave us, sipping his scotch and soda...totally unawares that we are about to deliver 500 kgs of high power torpedo to light up his ass...that's what's down there in that hold and who knows what the hell else...
FINNEGAN: Hold still now...I was like three rows back. Finnegan centers the needle over Pantucci's wound.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): ...Jagger was here...I was here...
PANTUCCI: You don't give a shit about anything do you?
FINNEGAN: Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of destination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
PANTUCCI: That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
FINNEGAN: Oh yeah...and that my stitch job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit... Finnegan sinks the needle into the wound. Pantucci's SCREAM rises above the music.
MATE: The entire bridge electrical system is shutting down sir!
CAPTAIN: Switch over to auxiliary power, and run a circuit check.
MATE: Yes sir... The COM. OFFICER is busy fiddling with the communications and imaging gear. DISTORTED LIGHTS from the scrambled systems plays off their faces.
COM. OFFICER: We're losing radar and sonar!
FIRST MATE: Communications systems are out sir! The Captain is confounded, on the edge of panic. Canton hurries onto the bridge.
CANTON: What the hell is going on?
CAPTAIN: Communication systems have failed! Radar...sonar...radios...I don't understand it.
MATE: Maybe it's the storm!
CANTON: Nonsense! We're impervious to weather!
FIST MATE: We have a main frame meltdown!!
CANTON: Well unmelt it!! Canton storms out. Every piece of electrical equipment on the bridge starts to shut down.
A LONG SCARY BEAT.: And then suddenly -- She SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY and gives a sharp CRY. Her eyes filled panic. She tries to stand, but she's JERKED BACK DOWN! Her ARMS FLAIL WILDLY. Scattering stuff off the counter. She tries to SCREAM, but it comes out more like a GURGLE. Below her, in the TOILET, there is a hideous SLURPING SOUND. She manages a final, desperate scream, a high-pitched WAIL. Which nobody hears because...
CANTON: Ladies and gentlemen...your attention please... Ladies and gentlemen... The disquieted crowd turns to Canton.
CANTON (CONT'D): This is the most technologically advanced sailing vessel on the water today. Every problem has been anticipated...the Captain has assured me that we will be up and running in no time...so enjoy yourselves...there's nothing to worry about... Suddenly, and quite violently, a WOMAN is SUCKED UNDER THE WATER -- THWUP! Others swimmers notice and freeze. The Woman doesn't come back up. And then, THREE more SWIMMERS are violently JERKED UNDER. All the people in and around the pool see this and panic. SCREAMING. YELLING. SWIMMING. SWIMMING and RUNNING. A CRACK OF THUNDER! The Captain calls out --
CAPTAIN: Remain calm! Stop! Do you hear? REMAIN CALM! The pool clears. Everybody backs the hell away from it. The WATER in the pool BUBBLES, and GURGLES, and then goes quiet. And then, from somewhere deep within the bowels of the ship, comes a loud, eerie, primordial YOWL. WE PUSH IN ON CANTON: His eyes slowly widen. Stunned. His calm replaced by pure terror.
CANTON: Dear God.
FINNEGAN: Leila see what they're up to... Leila exits. Finnegan's eyes go up from the action on deck to the radar screen, where a blip, fast moving, right toward the jet foil catches his attention.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): What the hell...
FINNEGAN: Joey!! Talk to me!
PANTUCCI: Jezebel's dead...Hercules is right behind her! We got a gusher in the hull!
FINNEGAN: Shit!! Finnegan locks the sticks down, and runs out.
PANTUCCI: What did you do to my kids!!
FINNEGAN: Me??
PANTUCCI: No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing? Finnegan notices something on the floor. He picks up a shard of the speedboat propeller. Strange. Hanover steps into the room.
HANOVER: What happened? Finnegan looks at the piece of speedboat in his hand.
FINNEGAN: We ran into a speedboat... He shows the piece of speed boat to Hanover. Who stares at it. Finnegan sees the hint of recognition in his eyes.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
HANOVER: How soon can we get up and running?
FINNEGAN: We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
HANOVER: I have a schedule...
PANTUCCI: I spent two years building these things...screw your schedule! Mason grabs Pantucci by the throat, lifting him off the ground.
MASON: You little weasel! Finnegan slams the piece of speed boat into the back of Mason's knees buckling him to the floor. In the blink of an eye there is the barrel of a .45 pressed hard against his head, Hanover at the trigger end.
HANOVER: We were talking about my schedule...
FINNEGAN: You're going to have to get a new one.
HANOVER: Not an option.
FINNEGAN: Then you better start swimming. Hanover cracks Finnegan across the face with the barrel of the gun. Finnegan's head spins. He touches the corner of his mouth, and comes away with blood, and a look of murder in his eyes. Hanover slams a round in the chamber.
HANOVER: One more joke and your comedy career is over. Now fix this.
PANTUCCI: With what? Look at them...they need gears...cylinder heads...oil pans... we're in the middle of the goddamn ocean...
FINNEGAN: I think he knows that Joey.
PANTUCCI: Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need... Mulligan comes running in.
MULLIGAN: Target in sight!!
HANOVER: Contact verified! You know the drill gentlemen! The merc's scatter below deck. Hanover hands the binoculars to Finnegan.
HANOVER (CONT'D): Care to see what dreams are made of Finnegan? Finnegan's POV through the binoculars. The Fuji Maru in the distance, lit up, beautiful.
VIVO: Lines set. Mason swivels the big HARPOON GUN on the bow.
MASON: Tow lines!
VIVO: Clear! He FIRES the HARPOON. It shoots and SLAMS into the rear deck of the Fuji Maru.
MASON: Tow line secure.
HANOVER: Secure the zone of operation!! Swift, athletic, the mercs leap onto the lines and scramble hand over hand toward the Fuji Maru's deck.
HANOVER (CONT'D): When I was a little bit of a pissant we lived down the road from where all the big cruise ships used to come into Sydney harbor... The first mercs reach the Fuji Maru's deck, and toss life lines down to Hanover.
HANOVER (CONT'D): Mum and me we used to sit by our front door and watch them...she used to say "one day you're going to make your fortune in life on one of them..." Hanover hands one line to Finnegan, one to Pantucci. The third he attaches around his waist.
FINNEGAN: Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
HANOVER: And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there. Finnegan and Pantucci comply.
FINNEGAN: I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
HANOVER: I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
PANTUCCI: (nervous) You know the crew could be armed.
HANOVER: With what? Martinis and tanning oil? Hanover hand signals to his men above. The lines go taut. Finnegan, Pantucci, and Hanover are hoisted to the deck of the Fuji Maru.
HANOVER: Synchronize watches... Everyone hits a button on their watches.
HANOVER (CONT'D): 25 minutes...by the numbers. Engine room and machine shop are on the third sub deck...Vivo...Mulligan go with them...keep in touch...move out...
LEILA: (angry) Kwan bat! Kwam bat! Booom!! She points the acetalyne tank she works with.
BILLY: (bothered) Yeah...yeah...yeah... Billy heads for the deck. Leila looks after him in disgust.
LEILA: Asshole... She ignites her torch, is about to flick her visor down again when a loud gurgling, a sucking sound, stops her. She cuts the torch. Looks around nervously...and then she spots the suction hose sucking away. She smiles to herself. Flips the visor, fires the torch, and goes back to work.
PANTUCCI: You'd think they'd set a deck watch... FLASH TO: The deck full of people partying, carousing. The railing is lined with 15 lifeboats suspended in their harnesses. FLASH BACK TO: Mulligan, Finnegan, Pantucci and Vivo staring at a completely deserted deck. The lifeboat harnesses swing in the breeze, eerily empty. Mulligan looks back to Vivo.
MULLIGAN: I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
VIVO: Maybe plans changed...
MULLIGAN: Plans don't change...
PANTUCCI: Maybe it's the wrong ship.
MULLIGAN: Shut up! And then a strange yowl echoes from somewhere deep in the bowels of the ship. Finnegan and Pantucci trade a look.
FINNEGAN: Let's just keep going.
MULLIGAN: (nervous) You ain't giving the orders here! And again the yowl. Everyone freezes.
MULLIGAN (CONT'D): Let's keep going!
MASON: What the... Uneasy, Hanover and his men look around at the over turned chairs. The smashed aquarium. Chin bends down and picks up a small squid from the bottom of the smashed aquarium. The squid wraps its tentacles around Chin's hand almost immediately. Chin regards it with curiosity.
HANOVER: Focus on the task Mr. Chin... ...and then the yowl freezes them. C.U. on Hanover's face. His eyes flicker with uncertainty...and a tinge of fear.
HANOVER: What the hell is going on?
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Next stop, Chinatown! Everyone jumps, freaked. Mulligan and Vivo spin around and OPEN FIRE. Start BLOWING the shit out of the TROLLEY CAR. The GUNS sound like nothing we've ever heard. ROLLING THUNDER. Absolutely deafening.
FINNEGAN: Guys!! Whoa! WHOA! WHOA! WHOOOAAA!! Finnegan finally tilts the muzzle of Mulligan's gun to the ceiling. They stop firing. A little wigged-out. Their professional demeanor going by the boards. All goes quiet. They look at Finnegan, who is the picture of calm.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Guys...get a grip. The Trolley car reverses. The ELECTRONIC VOICE is now CRACKED
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Next stop, Fisherman's Wharf. Mulligan whirls, his gun poised. Just then his headset crackles.
HANOVER (V.O.): (radio filtered) This is Red One...status report. Finnegan leans in towards Mulligan's mike.
FINNEGAN: (into radio) Your boys just killed a trolley car Red One. Mulligan pulls the radio away.
MULLIGAN: (into radio) We been down three decks, there's nobody home... Total spooky-town. Advise on how to proceed.
HANOVER: Stay to the schedule. Stay to the plan. Nothing has changed. But the look in Hanover's slightly unnerved eyes tells a different story.
TRILLIAN: Hello? The SOUND slowly MOVES across the wall. Then another WALL starts to GURGLE. Trillian spins around. She forces herself not to panic. Very cautiously, taking small measured steps she reaches the handle to the freezer, and tries to open it. No go. The gurgling ripples above her. Her mouth goes dry as her eyes follow the sound across the ceiling. Her hand goes to her hair. She pulls her lock pick out, and very slowly kneels down until she is eye level with the door lock. She begins to pick her way out, her ears and eyes following the gurgling above. Suddenly the sound stops. The silence makes Trillian's heart sound that much louder. She sidles close to the wall.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): Hello? Still silence. Cautious, she taps on the wall. For a moment nothing. And then...
WHAMM!!: Something slams against the wall from the other side in response. Trillian falls back against the door, her heart in her throat.
PANTUCCI: (rattling, nervous) You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
FINNEGAN: (calm) Joey...
PANTUCCI: ...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games... Finnegan turns to Pantucci, his voice even, calm, almost kind.
FINNEGAN: Joey...it's okay...
PANTUCCI: What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
FINNEGAN: Joey...look at me... He forces Pantucci to look him in the eyes.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): We're gonna get what we gotta get... do what we gotta do...and get the hell outta here...okay? Pantucci draws his strength from Finnegan. He forces himself to take a deep breath.
PANTUCCI: Okay... Suddenly, overhead, something black and veiny skitters across the mass of pipes, so fast it shocks Pantucci back into the wall.
MULLIGAN: What the...??? He and Vivo spin their guns at the pipes. The red dots of their laser sights sweep the shadowy web of metal. Nothing.
MULLIGAN (CONT'D): Come on...the sooner we get outta here the better I'll feel. Mulligan and Vivo move forward.
PANTUCCI: (quiet) Finnegan... Finnegan turns to Pantucci, who has not moved from where he hit the wall.
FINNEGAN: It's okay...come on...
PANTUCCI: (scared) I'm stuck... Pantucci tries to pull away from the wall. He is stuck.
MULLIGAN: (jumpy) Hey! What are you trying to pull!
PANTUCCI: (pleading) John... Finnegan takes Pantucci by the front of his shirt, ignoring Mulligan.
FINNEGAN: Relax your arms...slowly...that's it... As Finnegan pulls, Pantucci does as he is told. He slips away from the wall. The jacket doesn't.
MULLIGAN: What the... He reaches out to touch the wall. Finnegan grabs his wrist, grabs a flashlight from Vivo's utility belt and shines it on the wall. Their POV -- the entire wall is covered in a strange, yellow, secreted GELATIN. Laid on in some sort of weird, inhuman, geometric pattern. Like a spider web.
LEILA: Gebop!! The KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK of the PUMP is like a loud scary HEARTBEAT. Leila removes her blast visor. Wipes her brow. -- A MANGLED CORPSE GUSHES IN through the gaping hole! LEILA SCREAMS. Bloody murder. Scared shitless. Quickly backs away. Actually, it's only half a corpse. The bottom half having been eaten away. It's wearing a tuxedo. The corpse's face is tightly constricted, eyes wide open, a grotesque death mask. Leila shakes like a leaf, waist-deep in seawater.
BILLY: (into radio) I dunno where they came from, turned around and there they were. (pause) No, no passengers. (pause) No shit I'll keep my eyes open.
KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK.: Leila slowly starts edging her way around the corpse.
KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK.: Her eyes are transfixed, staring at the abomination, too scared to scream.
KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK.: Her back is to the gaping hole as she slowly starts to pass in front of it.
KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK.: The water swirls around her waist.
KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK.: She's almost past the gaping hole now.
KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK...: Then something grabs her! She SCREAMS! And falls back towards the gaping hole -- But it's only a twisted piece of metal off a strut. She exhales. Relieved.
KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK.: Suddenly, LEILA'S whole body SPASMS. She SCREECHES wildly, in great pain. The she's RIPPED backward out through the gaping hole. Gone. WATER SLOSHES back in.
FINNEGAN: The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
MULLIGAN: So?
FINNEGAN: So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
MULLIGAN: Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
PANTUCCI: Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
MULLIGAN: 'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head... Vivo pulls his feet further up on the barrel.
VIVO: What I want to know is why the goddamn ocean is always cold...since I'm a kid I hate god damn cold water. Then out of the corner of his eye, Vivo sees SOMETHING MOVE. He spins around. Nothing but pipes and hoses.
MULLIGAN: (nervous) What was that?
VIVO: Nothing.
MULLIGAN: Someone's back there.
VIVO: Hey! Come out here! Finnegan and Pantucci stop working. All eyes are focused on the maze of pipes. THINGS are HISSING, HUMMING and RUMBLING. Nothing moves.
MULLIGAN: Check it out!
VIVO: Hey! You hear me? Come out! Still no response.
MULLIGAN: Will you check it the hell out!! Disgusted, Vivo puts his feet in the water, gingerly.
VIVO: Man this shit is cold! He walks toward the mass of hissing pipes. His pulse rifle rising.
VIVO (CONT'D): I'm gonna kick your ass for putting me through this... Then he hears a strange SLURPING and SUCKING SOUND coming from behind some gears at the end of a little alleyway.
VIVO (CONT'D): I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
MULLIGAN: What is it man?
VIVO: I'm looking... Vivo slowly goes in for a closer look, gun out front, heading down the little alleyway. He looks behind some pipes. The SLURPING gets LOUDER. Then he sees it. His eyes widen --
VIVO (CONT'D): On shit! And that's the last thing he ever says. Because just then, from a dark area between the pipes, SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT! Mulligan, Finnegan, and Pantucci stare in horrified amazement as Vivo is viciously YANKED into the pipes. A moment later a WASH OF BLOOD is FLUNG across a wall. Mulligan freaks out, aims his rifle at the pipes.
MULLIGAN: Vivo!! Vivo!! As Mulligan's attention diverts, Finnegan instinctively heads for Vivo's rifle, lying on the floor. Mulligan swings around. KACHUNK!! His rifle is armed. The laser dot fixes on Finnegan's forehead.
MULLIGAN (CONT'D): Touch it and you're dead, asshole! Finnegan freezes, looking up at a very freaked out Mulligan.
PANTUCCI: Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
MULLIGAN: What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo? Everybody's breathing hard. Freaked out. Major tension. Blood drips down the wall.
TRILLIAN: Helloooo? She shrugs, must be her imagination. From inside her low cut dress she pulls the Captain's gold security card. She is about to run it through the reader slot when...
V.O.: Ahem... She spins to...Hanover, Mason, Mamooli and Chin. Looking grim.
TRILLIAN: (recovering) I'm sorry... This area is for authorized personnel only. As the assistant to the Purser, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to vacate... Mason and Chin lift their pulse-rifles. KACHUNK!!
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): Or maybe not.
HANOVER: Where is everybody? Trillian is confused --
TRILLIAN: What do you mean? Hanover steps forward, right in her face.
HANOVER: (threatening) I mean...where is everybody?
TRILLIAN: Poolside? Hanover grabs Trillian by the throat and slams her against the wall. He rams his gun against her forehead.
HANOVER: You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
TRILLIAN: (choking) A passenger... Hanover blinks.
HANOVER: Where are the other passengers? Trillian shrugs. Mason grabs the card out of her hand.
MASON: Forget her...let's get what we came for and get the hell out of here! Mason runs the card through the slot. The ELECTRONICS KICK IN. LIGHTS FLASH. TUMBLERS ROLL. CLICK! It unlocks. Hanover's HEADSET comes alive with Mulligan SCREAMING.
HANOVER: Mulligan?? What?? I can't hear you?? Repeat I... -- Mason JERKS the vault door open. A FIRE-AXE SWING DOWN into his head, WHUMP! Kills him instantly. Eyes wide open. Everybody freaks out. Jumps back. Hanover lets go of Trillian, and stares into the vault directly at Nigel Canton. Holding the axe.
CANTON: Oh my God. I didn't mean to... Behind Canton the Captain is on the floor, in severe pain, his clothes are ripped up, REVEALING nasty looking RED SCARS, blistered and puffy, all over his chest and arms.
CANTON (CONT'D): I thought it was one of them! Chin jams his rifle to the middle of Canton's forehead, and cocks a round into the chamber.
HANOVER: Stand down soldier! But this is one soldier who is slow to obey the order. Hanover grabs Chin by both shoulders and gives a colossal yank.
HANOVER (CONT'D): I said... He slams Chin against the wall. In the process he loses his headset.
HANOVER (CONT'D): Stand down!! Chin and Hanover stare at each other, their chests heaving. Mason finally drops to the ground. All she wrote.
CANTON: I didn't mean to! I though it was one of them!
HANOVER: One of who?!
MULLIGAN: Hanover!...Hanover! Come in! Come in you son-of-a-bitch! No response. A sucking sound comes from the dark mass of pipes. Mulligan spins.
MULLIGAN (CONT'D): Hanover!! Hanover!!
FINNEGAN: Forget them... Mulligan spins back to Finnegan and Pantucci.
MULLIGAN: (fried) Shut up! You hear me!!
FINNEGAN: ...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
MULLIGAN: Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
PANTUCCI: What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
MULLIGAN: There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and... Suddenly, Mulligan's LEGS are suddenly JERKED OUT from under him. He hits the floor hard. Starts FIRING WILDLY. Finnegan and Pantucci hit the watery deck. BULLETS RICOCHET everywhere. Mulligan is WHIPPED across the floor. SCREAMING in fear. His pulse-rifle goes flying. He's SLAMMED into a metal pylon, then SUCKED into a dark void in the pipes. All in the blink of an eye. Finnegan grabs Mulligan's pulse-rifle. OPENS FIRE. BLASTING the shit out of anything and everything that moves.
FINNEGAN: Grab the parts!! Pantucci grabs the knapsack, cramming as many parts as he can into it as Finnegan keeps firing into the steaming, creaking, sparking machinery.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): I'll cover! Move! Move! Pantucci doesn't have to be told twice. He runs like hell, with Finnegan firing a final burst, and following.
HANOVER: This is Red one! Come in Red two! The gunfire stops, replaced by an ominous, horrifying, sucking sound.
CANTON: (panicked) It's them! We've got to get off! He runs out of the vault. The Captain follows close behind. Hanover listens to the sucking sound getting louder and louder.
HANOVER: Let's find them!
CHIN: What about the vault?
HANOVER: It's not going anywhere... Hanover rushes out with Chin right behind. Only Trillian remains, breathing deeply, scared...but not scared enough to forget the reason she came cruising in the first place. She goes right to the vault, opens one of the boxes, removes the giant diamond, drops it down her decolletage, pulls her high heels off, and runs out.
PANTUCCI: Finnegan, what the hell was that?
FINNEGAN: I don't know...you got what we need?
PANTUCCI: If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe? Both of them listen to the silence. And then, at the far end of the grating, one grate rises...and falls. Finnegan and Pantucci watch, transfixed. Then, like a locomotive gathering speed, the grates start rising and falling, faster and faster, clanking louder and louder, headed right for the two of them.
FINNEGAN: Come on!! Finnegan and Pantucci run up the stairs as fast as they can...just as the grate they were standing on rises and falls. Silence returns. Except for the steaming, creaking machinery...and an ominous sucking sound.
TRILLIAN: Up!! I want to go up! She panics. And starts pushing the up button frantically, her heart pounding in her chest. There is not a sound except for the hum of the elevator descending...until something drops on the roof with a THUMP! Trillian screams. The elevator comes to a bumps stop.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): No...No... Trillian shrinks from the ceiling of the elevator...and then the car starts to move again.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): Go up...please go up! Trillian pounds on ever button on the console, to no avail. The car continues its inexorable descent. Finally, in desperation, she hits the emergency stop button. The elevator stops. The emergency SIREN WHINES. A LONG BEAT. Nothing moves...and then... WHAM! Something beats on the roof, trying to break in. And again -- WHAM! The ELEVATOR SHUDDERS and continues its descent. Trillian backs up against the wall, staring at the ceiling, scared. The ELEVATOR DINGS! Startled, TRILLIAN SCREAMS. The DOORS start to OPEN. Panicked, Trillian raises the only weapon at her disposal...a high heel. The DOORS OPEN. -- SOMETHING LUNGES IN! Trillian swings her high heel...right into Pantucci's face! Finnegan plows in right behind him.
PANTUCCI: Trillian tries to run out. Finnegan grabs her.
TRILLIAN: I'm not staying here!
FINNEGAN: It ain't any better out there! Trillian struggles. Finnegan does not let go of her.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Lady, I'm telling you... Trillian buries her high heel into the back of Finnegan's hand, breaking his grip.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Just then, the doors to the elevator shut, and the car starts to ascend.
TRILLIAN: Now look what you did!
FINNEGAN: I saved your life is what I did!
TRILLIAN: Who asked you to!
PANTUCCI: What the hell's going on here?
TRILLIAN: You're with that other bunch, right?
FINNEGAN: What other bunch?
TRILLIAN: The thieves.
FINNEGAN: I'm not a thief.
TRILLIAN: Then who are you?
FINNEGAN: I'm their ride. Trillian hears music to her ears.
TRILLIAN: You have a boat? Her demeanor changes, her voice goes to honey.
PANTUCCI: Finnegan! Trillian and Finnegan turn to Pantucci who is looking down at the floor where a mass of yellow slime has dripped from the ceiling. All look up to the yellow goo dripping from the ceiling...followed by a sucking sound.
TRILLIAN: It's up there!! Finnegan lifts his pulse rifle and blasts the ceiling. The sucking sound stops.
FINNEGAN: Not anymore. The elevator stops. DING! The door opens. Finnegan whirls his rifle, rising. Trillian lifts her high heel, ready to strike... Hanover, Chin, and Mamooli have their massive guns trained on the car. The Captain and Canton quiver behind them. There is a momentary stand off.
HANOVER: Where are my men?
FINNEGAN: Dead.
CHIN: Chin charges Finnegan, the butt of his rifle raised to smash Finnegan's skull. Finnegan parries and drives Chin into the rear wall of the elevator. Mamooli jumps Finnegan from behind, wrapping his rifle against Finnegan's throat. Pantucci jumps on Mamooli's massive back, ripping at his face. Finnegan drops, buries his elbow in Mamooli's solar plexus, spins, and has his knife out of his boot and at Mamooli's throat in a flash. ANGLE ON: Trillian. Impressed. She had no idea.
HANOVER: Drop it! Finnegan looks up into the barrel of Hanover's gun...and a pair of eyes that will use it. Finnegan does as he is told.
HANOVER (CONT'D): Now, back up! Again, Finnegan does as he is told.
HANOVER (CONT'D): Everybody in! The Captain and Canton are only to happy to comply. As they slip in, Trillian tries to slip out. Hanover swings his gun on her.
HANOVER (CONT'D): Where are you going?
TRILLIAN: (freezing) Nowhere...
FINNEGAN: Hanover, listen...
HANOVER: Shut up! Hanover hit the elevator button. The elevator starts to rise.
HANOVER (CONT'D): Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
FINNEGAN: I told you...
PANTUCCI: Man, there's something here! On the boat!
CANTON: You see? You see?
HANOVER: Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
FINNEGAN: Did you clear this?
HANOVER: With who? All of a sudden, the car is jerked to a halt, as if some giant hand was yanking on the cable.
FINNEGAN: With that... And then, the elevator jerks down again. And up. Everyone is thrown about like straw. Everyone is shouting, panicked. And then the jerking stops...and the sound of sucking surrounds the car. The cable starts twisting, creaking sickeningly above their heads.
PANTUCCI: It's gonna snap the cable! Trillian starts hitting the buttons frantically.
TRILLIAN: Open! Open! God damn it!! Finnegan is at the doors, pulling them with all his might.
FINNEGAN: Help me!! Pantucci, then Mamooli, then Hanover and Chin pull at the doors as Trillian keeps hitting the buttons. The doors part a bit.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): They're coming! They're coming! The doors fly open to...a solid wall.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Oh shit... And silence...until the doors slam shut...the cable snaps...and the car plummets! Screaming and shouting mixes with the bloodcurdling shrieking of the metal elevator frame against the shaft. Finnegan's eyes go to the floor indicator.
VOICE: 4th floor. 3rd floor. 2nd floor. 1st floor... Down, down, down it goes. Faster and faster. But the elevator doesn't stop at the first floor. It keeps dropping. The FLOOR
CANTON: It's taking us to the bottom of the ship!
FINNEGAN: CABLES SNAP. METAL SCREAMS. The ELEVATOR starts to BUCKLE. Which is actually good, because it's getting jammed sideways in the shaft which slows it down. The it HITS bottom with a resounding crash.
HANOVER: Where are we?
CANTON: The sublevel lobby. Finnegan bends down to pick up one of the pulse rifles.
HANOVER: Don't touch it! Finnegan looks up to Hanover standing a bit shakily, his own rifle trained on Finnegan.
FINNEGAN: You shoot me and you got no ride home... And with that, Finnegan picks up the gun. A test of wills. Finnegan wins, and then turns to the Captain.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): You the Captain?
CAPTAIN: Yes.
FINNEGAN: How do we get out of here?
CAPTAIN: We have to make it to the third deck... Pantucci steps on something. CRUNCH! He looks down, his eyes widen.
PANTUCCI: Oh no!! Oh no!! Finnegan!!! He starts dancing around, trying not to step on whatever it is. Trillian looks down and SCREAMS. Everybody freaks -- Finnegan grabs a flashlight from Chin's utility belt, and sweeps the beam over the lobby. The entire floor of the lobby is littered with shattered HUMAN SKELETONS. Picked clean and spit out. Just like the earlier whale bones. Then suddenly, at the far end of the hallway, one of the metal WALLS suddenly EXPANDS and FLEXES. Everybody feezes. And then the FLEXING suddenly comes RACING down either side of the hallway, accompanied by the most god-awful PRIMORDIAL
FINNEGAN: This way! FINNEGAN BOLTS. Everybody else right behind him. The FLEXING and SCREECHING VANISHES into the walls.
BILLY: Hey you! Muscles! Out here! There is no reply. The only sound is the sucking of the pump.
BILLY (CONT'D): O.K. You want it that way... He ENTERS the waist-high water.
BILLY (CONT'D): ...when I find you, you pay... Billy heads deeper into the hold.
TRILLIAN: We've gotta call for help.
PANTUCCI: Yeah man, no shit, call in the Marines.
CAPTAIN: We can't...all the communication systems went down.
TRILLIAN: So get them back up.
CAPTAIN: I don't know how.
PANTUCCI: Hey I can fix any damn thing... where's the comm. center?
CANTON: We should get off as soon as possible.
TRILLIAN: But if we can at least send a message...
CANTON: I say we evacuate as soon as...
FINNEGAN: (to Canton) Who are you?
CAPTAIN: He's the owner...
FINNEGAN: Why don't you want a message sent?
CANTON: I just think that...
FINNEGAN: Because you know a message can't be sent... There is a moment of silence.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): You're the inside guy aren't you? The guy who knocked out the communications. Hanover sets Mason's pulse-rifle down and claps his hands.
HANOVER: Bravo. Canton flashes Hanover a look. The Captain is confused. Trillian suddenly GRABS CANTON, spins him around and SLAMS him against the hull.
TRILLIAN: How the hell do we fix it?! A tense moment as Canton debates his situation, then relents.
CANTON: You can't... All the systems were melted at their core by nitric acid...
CAPTAIN: (confused) This was your life's work...your dreams...
CANTON: My dreams cost more than they would make...I miscalculated the market... there was no way I could recoup...
FINNEGAN: Unless you collected on the insurance...
TRILLIAN: What are you people talking about?
FINNEGAN: He's with them. He motions to the mercenaries.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): They rob the joint blind and torpedo it to the bottom. He collects the insurance, and sails off into the sunset clean as a whistle. Finnegan fixes Hanover with a look of certainty.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Right? The Captain blows. He leaps on Canton. His hands find the older man's throat.
CAPTAIN: All these people dead!! Because you screwed up on the math?? Finnegan pulls the Captain off.
FINNEGAN: It's not going to help us!
CAPTAIN: We're going to die here! We're going to die! Finnegan holds the Captain with both hands, calming him.
FINNEGAN: I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
TRILLIAN: (alarmed) You hear that? Unseen by anyone, there is MOVEMENT within the MACHINERY. The walls start to come alive with dark, SHADOWY IMPRESSIONS. HIDDEN within the maze of machinery, OBSCURED by the bad lighting, glistening abominations slither over pipes, squirm through gears, and undulate in and out of crevices and holes. The room is becoming a living, throbbing, pulsating horror.
CAPTAIN: They are...they are everywhere.
FINNEGAN: All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves. Everybody slowly and quietly moves for the far hatch. Then a loud GURGLING is HEARD. Everybody looks up at the ceiling. Hidden within the girders, and sticking to them, a large translucent INTESTINE-like thing CROSSES the ceiling. Inside it are strange, disgusting biological workings. The GURGLING suddenly gets dramatically LOUDER. And then we SEE BILLY and LEILA, being sucked down the entire length of the fatty intestine. Still alive. And squirming wildly. EVERYBODY freaks out and HAULS ASS for the hatch. Finnegan and Hanover OPEN FIRE. Covering their asses.
FINNEGAN: ...Spins, gun ready to fire at...
TRILLIAN: Noooo!
FINNEGAN: Jesus Christ lady...
TRILLIAN: (scared) What are those things?
FINNEGAN: I don't know... Finnegan looks around to the engine room, a labyrinth of pipe lined alleyways, motorized chambers, swaying catwalks and pillars of steel. The LIGHTING is very poor, very dark. He takes off.
TRILLIAN: Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
FINNEGAN: ...there's got to be a way to access out back there... He motions into the deep shadows.
TRILLIAN: But what makes you think there aren't more of hose...things...back there?
FINNEGAN: Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't... Trillian weighs her options, and takes off after Finnegan.
TRILLIAN: You don't have to be so touchy.
FINNEGAN: Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
TRILLIAN: What's that supposed to mean? You people.
FINNEGAN: You people...rich people...
TRILLIAN: I'm not rich people.
FINNEGAN: Well, you sure do a good imitation.
TRILLIAN: Thank you, I work at it... Finnegan comes to a ladderstair leading to a catwalk. He starts to climb. Trillian, hampered by her long slinky dress, rips at the bottom, making it maxi to mini in a flash, and scoots after Finnegan.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): I heard you say you grew up in the projects in the Bronx... Reaching the top of the ladder, she clambers onto the catwalk next to Finnegan, who is deciding which way to go.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): Trillian Daley... She holds out her hand.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): Projects...South Chicago. Finnegan ignores her hand.
FINNEGAN: Finnegan...John J...now that we've been properly introduced, can we get the hell out of here? Finnegan starts to walk down the catwalk.
TRILLIAN: So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
FINNEGAN: That's what I do.
TRILLIAN: Seen a lot of islands?
FINNEGAN: Quite a few.
TRILLIAN: Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
FINNEGAN: Anti social?
TRILLIAN: Self sufficient...
FINNEGAN: With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
TRILLIAN: Takes one to know one. SNAP!! A TENTACLE SHOOTS OUT between Finnegan and Trillian. Just missing them as it SLAMS into a wall. Finnegan falls onto the catwalk, drops his rifle, unarmed. Trillian, freaked, stumbles back and lands on her butt. Finnegan sits up against the walls, turns and looks -- The TENTACLE slowly SQUIRMS across the wall like a big leach. Trying to find its prey. Finnegan is frozen in place. Watching. Trillian sits up, eyes widening in fear as she sees -- Hideous little worm-like FEELERS and SUCKERS protrude up and down the Tentacle. WRIGGLING and WRITHING and feeling their way across the wall. Getting closer and closer to Finnegan. Finnegan's eyes go to his pulse-rifle close to Trillian's feet. He motions for her to push it toward him. But, frozen in fear, she can only watch the slithering horror before her. Tongue-like, the Feelers lick their way across the oily wall. FINNEGAN DUCKS as they squirm over his head. Then he BRUSHES against some dirt, making a SCRAPING SOUND. A Feeler quickly drops down and touches Finnegan's arm. He leaps to his feet. So does Trillian. She grabs the rifle, turns and bolts off down the dark alley. Finnegan tries to run, but the Feelers hold him tight. Two more Feelers slap onto his arm. HE YELLS. The Creature starts reeling him in. ANGLE ON: Trillian, running. Finnegan's YELL reaches her. She stops cold. Looking back the way she came, torn. ANGLE ON: Finnegan, fighting for all he is worth, being reeled into the mass of machinery by the tentacle. When...out of the darkness, Trillian suddenly comes running back. Panting hard, she aims the gun.
FINNEGAN: Shoot it! Shoot it! Spurred to action, Trillian jams the rifle barrel against the tentacle and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): The safety! The safety! Trillian frantically fumbles around, looking for the right lever on the complicated, sophisticated weapon, trying to find it.
TRILLIAN: I don't know where it is!
FINNEGAN: On the side!! Desperate, unable to find it, she does the next best thing...she swings her rifle like it's a baseball bat. SMACKS the TENTACLE. HARD. RIPPING into its flesh. It SQUIRTS ink blood, releases Finnegan and recoils. Finnegan drops to his knees. Grabbing his arm, in pain. The tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again. Trillian grabs him, and with all her strength, jerks him to his feet, and starts to drag him backward. The tentacle coils, ready to strike. Just before it does so, Finnegan grabs the rifle with his one good arm, flips the safety, and fires, blasting the tentacle to pieces.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Let's get the hell out of here! Finnegan staggers to his feet. He and Trillian run off.
FINNEGAN: (annoyed) The safety...the safety... He flicks the safety on and off.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Got it?
TRILLIAN: (pissed) Hey! I didn't have to come back.
FINNEGAN: Yeah you did...
TRILLIAN: (defensive) Right... You have a boat.
FINNEGAN: Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
TRILLIAN: Oh yeah? What kind is that?
FINNEGAN: The "come back" kind.
TRILLIAN: How do you know that?
FINNEGAN: Takes one to know one. Finnegan's small smile makes Trillian acutely uncomfortable.
CAPTAIN: Help me! But Canton does not move. All of a sudden Canton sees something deep in the web, behind the Captain, which makes his blood freeze.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D): What is it? Canton takes a few steps back.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D): What?!... WHAT?! The Captain tries to look over his shoulder to see what it is. There is a DARK MOVEMENT deep within the spider web.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D): ANGLE ON: Finnegan and Trillian racing across a catwalk. Below them, they can see Canton backing away from the Captain.
FINNEGAN: Grab his hands!! Canton looks up, stunned, as he sees Finnegan and Trillian rushing down from the catwalk.
CAPTAIN: Canton backs away from the Captain, as the Captain's struggle draws him further into the web. The Captain's eyes bulge, horrified, as he feels SOMETHING inside the spider web GRAB him from behind.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D): He struggles WILDLY. Then starts to freeze up as the tentacles wrap around him. Finnegan and Trillian race across the floor as the Captain is slowly sucked deeper into the spider web; his face and body bady constricting, paralyzed. His VOICE is CHOKED OFF. Hanover, Chin, Mamooli and Pantucci burst out of another alleyway. Finnegan and Trillian reach the Captain just as his FACE is SUCKED into the gelatinous web. They skid to a stop. Everybody piles up. Eyes wide. Watching as the Captain's body is pulled deeper into the dark web. Tentacles enveloping him.
HANOVER: (to Canton) Where is the closest hatch? Canton still pressed against the wall, staring at the spot the Captain disappeared, talking to himself.
CANTON: I never meant for anyone to get hurt ...it was supposed to be clean... Hanover grabs Canton by the front of his tattered tuxedo jacket.
HANOVER: You hypocritical bastard...all you gave a shit about was the money... where's the hatch!! Canton points down a darkened passageway.
HANOVER (CONT'D): Alright let's move out...you two on point... He looks at an uneasy Mamooli and Chin.
FINNEGAN: Joey... Which way's aft?
PANTUCCI: That way. He points in the opposite direction.
HANOVER: Who gives a shit about aft?
FINNEGAN: That's where my boat's moored.
HANOVER: You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
FINNEGAN: Just trying to get to my boat... Finnegan takes off down a catwalk in the opposite direction that disappears in the dark. Pantucci is right with him. Trillian, a step behind.
HANOVER: (yelling) You stay away from that vault! You hear me? Just before he steps into the darkness, Finnegan calls over his shoulder...
FINNEGAN: They respond to sound... He disappears into the dark. Canton looks at Hanover for a long moment, and then takes off after Finnegan. The other two mercs look at Hanover, wavering.
HANOVER: (tense) What? The sound of his voice makes the two mercs look around nervously.
MAMOOLI: (whispered) He made sense.
HANOVER: (loud) He's a bloody... And then conscious of his voice reverberating...
HANOVER (CONT'D): (whispered) ...he's a bloody taxi driver! Chin breaks for the catwalk, hurrying after Finnegan. Hanover stands with a very antsy Mamooli, steaming. After a long moment, he strides off after Finnegan as well.
HANOVER: (whispered) Very good Finnegan...very good. Trillian moves up to Finnegan. She reaches into her hair, and pulls out her trusty lockpick. As he watches, somewhat mystified, she inserts the pin, tickles the lock a few times, and depresses the handle. Click! The door opens. Finnegan looks at her curiously, but with respect.
FINNEGAN: What's on the far side?
CANTON: I don't know.
PANTUCCI: (nerves) It's your damn ship! What the hell do you mean you don't know? Finnegan touches Pantucci's shoulder.
FINNEGAN: Joey, what difference does it make... Finnegan enters the water.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): If you hear one shot, you know I made it...start coming... Pantucci follows Finnegan to the water.
HANOVER: How do we know you're going to signal...how do we know you're not going to just take off? Finnegan stops.
FINNEGAN: I'll wait here... You go check it out. Hanover does not move.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): (contemptuous) I didn't think so. Finnegan wades into the water. Just before he sinks beneath the surface...
TRILLIAN: Finnegan... He looks back.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): Be careful. With a smile, Finnegan dives under. Pantucci right behind him. The others stand looking around, nervous.
HANOVER: Stop pacing. Canton acts as if he does not hear. He keeps pacing. Hanover chops sharply with the stock of his rifle into Canton's arm. Canton crumbles against the railing, in pain.
HANOVER: You deaf?
TRILLIAN: Why don't you back off?
HANOVER: You want some too? Hanover's jaw clenches. He releases the safety on his rifle, the click resounding ominously in the hollow room.
TRILLIAN: How brave we are. Trillian's eyes fix on Hanover's, unwavering. A Mexican standoff.
MAMOOLI: Hanover! Everyone turn to... A giant ball of black, wet, OOZING RUBBER UNDULATES down the gangway. Coming straight at them. A mass of glistening striated MUSCLE.
HANOVER: Fire!! The three men open up with their pulse rifles. The CREATURE gets RIPPED TO SHREDS. Red and blue INK-BLOOD SPLATTERS everywhere. But onward it comes. Down the gangway. Trillian grabs the pistol off Chin's utility belt, and opens fire. Canton jumps into the water and disappears.
FINNEGAN: You O.K.? Trillian can only nod, and gasp for breath. Canton and Hanover catch their breath, PANTING AWAY, waterlogged. Hanover reaches over to retrieve the rifle in Trillian's hand. Trillian points the barrel at him, and hits the safety.
TRILLIAN: (grim) Finders keepers. Mamooli bursts out of the water, falling on the floor, close to panic mode.
MAMOOLI: Where's Chin?
TRILLIAN: Gone...
MAMOOLI: This is not real! This is not bloody real! Finnegan TOPPLES a large, heavy metal BROILER onto the open floor gate, sealing the watery hole in the floor. There are two hatches in this room. The far hatch is closed. Mamooli stands next to an OPEN HATCH. Canton points to it.
CANTON: Through there...another sixty, seventy yards...there are more elevators there.
PANTUCCI: I ain't goin' up no more elevators.
CANTON: There's stairways... Mamooli SLAMS the HATCH SHUT. Eyes bugging out of his head.
MAMOOLI: I say we stay right here!
PANTUCCI: Are you crazy?
MAMOOLI: (desperate) There's plenty of food here. We can hold out...someone'll rescue us...
FINNEGAN: Who?
MAMOOLI: Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
PANTUCCI: On what? This son of a bitch (to Canton) zapped the communications.
HANOVER: Mamooli stand down!
MAMOOLI: We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
FINNEGAN: Boat or no boat...I'm going... Finnegan steps forward. Mamooli aims his rifle right at Finnegan's head.
MAMOOLI: They're wipin' us out one at a time. I say we make a stand. Right here! Right now! Maximum firepower!
PANTUCCI: Somebody shoot this jerk!
FINNEGAN: (calm) Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
MAMOOLI: I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here! Finnegan freezes. CLOSE ON: The hatch. As a BLACK LIQUID starts to OOZE through a tiny latch-hole. No one sees it.
FINNEGAN: I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
MAMOOLI: What the hell are you talking about?
FINNEGAN: Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish. The LIQUID SHADOW OOZES down and hits the floor, starts to EXPAND, filling like a water balloon. It's not a liquid. It's a Tentacle. VEINS, FEELERS and SUCKERS begin to form.
MAMOOLI: And what? These things are octopuses
FINNEGAN: I don't know what these things are ...all I know is... The TENTACLE slowly RISES UP right behind Mamooli. Inches behind his head. Finnegan and Hanover see it. Eyes widening.
MAMOOLI: What...? What?? Mamooli turns to the tentacle looming over him, about to strike.
MAMOOLI (CONT'D): He opens fire, emptying his clip into the tentacle. The tentacle retreats into the pipes. Mamooli looks around. The room is empty. He runs out.
PANTUCCI: What the hell is going on!! Finnegan heads for another open HATCHWAY. It also SLAMS SHUT.
FINNEGAN: They're herding us. Finnegan and company keep going.
HANOVER: What are you talking about? As they round a corner, the CEILING IMPLODES right in front of them. PIPES and OTHER MATTER CRASH down. Cutting them off. Leaving only one route open...a slim passageway.
FINNEGAN: Like cattle...
TRILLIAN: You're saying they can think?
FINNEGAN: I'm saying they're calling the shots... Finnegan heads toward the passageway.
CANTON: Do we have to go there? The ceiling left above them begins to torque, and splits. The answer is plain. Everyone runs into the passage just as the ceiling comes down.
TRILLIAN: What's the matter?
FINNEGAN: The quiet...
HANOVER: Maybe we lost them.
FINNEGAN: Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be. Finnegan moves on. The others follow. Guns out front. TENSE. They round a huge metal pillar and come face-to-face with a soul-wrenching nightmare. The CREATURES' NEST -- OR STOMACH. Across a small portion of the ship's midsection, is a huge GELATINOUS WOMB. Imagine a massive thick wall of clear-yellow JELL-O, with hundreds of BLUE VEINS running through it. If it weren't all so horrific, it would be considered beautiful. Inside the womb, A DOZEN HUMANS, passengers, float around in some kind of twisted embryonic state, the living dead. They all seem to be breathing the gelatin. Several TENTACLES WRIGGLE through the stuff; which divides and re forms in some sort of strange mitosis. Finnegan and the others look at the passengers, horrified. But even more horrifying is that the people can look back at them. Many start to reach out, seemingly in slow motion as their hands ooze through the thick gelatin. Trillian looks sick, trembles in fear.
TRILLIAN: What is it?
FINNEGAN: A meat locker.
TRILLIAN: We can't just leave them here. Canton looks like he's about to throw up, he starts backing away, heading for a side hatch.
CANTON: I can. In the womb, a Tentacle suddenly approaches a sexy young LADY. The Lady tries to back-pedal away, but because of the gelatin, it's like one of those nightmares where you can only move in slow motion. The FEELERS GRIP her naked thigh. She tries to scream, but her face is already starting to constrict, her whole body is being paralyzed. Pantucci is so horrified he's about to cry.
PANTUCCI: Oh no...oh God please no. The TENTACLE-SAC gloms onto the Lady's forehead. THROUGH THE SAC we can SEE her SKIN MELTING. The only thing she can move are her EYES, which are bugging-out in absolute horror as she is imbibed alive. Our heroes are frozen in fear. Until the Lady's EYES LIQUEFY. Trillian burries her head in Finnegan's shoulder, trying to shut out the horror.
FINNEGAN: We can't do anything for them... Let's go... He begins to lead her toward the hatch...when her eyes recognized the old lady with the orchid in her hair. The old lady seems to see her too. Her hands read out, IMPLORING. Her mouth silently shapes the words: HELP ME! Just as a tentacle comes creeping toward her.
TRILLIAN: Her rage rises. She hefts her rifle, and starts blasting away.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): You won't get her!! You won't!! Spitting FLAMES and SMOKE. The BULLETS IMPACT the gelatin. BLASTING IT AWAY. But the bullets only manage to go about twenty feet into the thick shit before gliding to a stop. GELATIN EXPLODES all over the place. TRACER HOLES STREAK through the stuff. But all the bullets are sliding short.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): Finnegan...do something!! Please!! Finnegan looks around and spots the place in the ceiling where most of the Tentacles are coming from. Their long TAILS WIGGLE down from a massive clutter of pipes. A bas-relief of horror. Finnegan reaches over and yanks two thermite grenades off Hanover's utility belt.
HANOVER: Finnegan, No!!! ...bites the pins and spits them out.
FINNEGAN: Eat this. He chucks the grenades up into the strange WRITHING FRESCO, safely clear of the passengers.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Pantucci and Hanover throw themselves to the floor. Finnegan pulls Trillian down, covering her.
FINNEGAN: Looking good...
TRILLIAN: You should talk... Then the machinery shuts down. The engines go dead. ALL SOUND CUTS OUT. An expectant hush. Somewhere, WATER DRIPS... WE GO EXTREMELY CLOSE ON Trillian's EYES. Pantucci's EYES. Hanover's EYES. Finnegan's EYES. The air is riddled with ominous expectation. And that's when the HULL BEGINS TO TORQUE. RIVETS POP and SNAP. WATER SPRAYS. METAL BUCKLES.
CRASHING TOWARDS THEM. RIPPING OUT PIPES, DUCTS, WALLS,: EQUIPMENT and EVERYTHING in front of it.
FINNEGAN: They all hightail it for hatches. Finnegan and Trillian make it into one hatch. Hanover and Pantucci make it into another. WATER CRASHES and SPRAYS behind them.
FINNEGAN: We're going to sink! We've got to get on deck! They backtrack. Trillian's now in the lead. They HAUL ASS down a hallway. WATER ROARING IN from everywhere behind them. All of the watertight HATCHES begin to hydraulically CLOSE. Trillian and Finnegan JAG into a hatch. It's a small room. The hatch in front of them closes. WATER BLASTS in behind them. SWEEPS them off their feet. The ROOM quickly starts to FILL UP. Trillian pulls frantically at the hatch.
TRILLIAN: So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
FINNEGAN: You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living... The knife blade slips into the crack.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): I'll break the seal! Pull. He yanks the blade. Trillian pulls. The seal pops. The portal flies open. Waist-high in water, Trillian sticks her arm out, tries to get her shoulder out, but there's no chance in hell of that.
TRILLIAN: Too small! She pulls her arm out. And a TENTACLE LUNGES IN. Just missing Trillian. It SPLASHES under the water. GRABS Finnegan's ankle. Pulls him under. FINNEGAN sticks the barrel of his gun underwater and OPENS FIRE. WATER EXPLODES. The Tentacle recoils. And rips itself back out the porthole. Trillian SLAMS the PORTHOLE SHUT and dogs it tight. The
PANTUCCI: Gimme one! Gimme one! He knocks both of them out of Hanover's hands. They DISAPPEAR under the water.
HANOVER: You idiot! They quickly fumble around in the water, trying to find them. A TENTACLE BLASTS around the corner. Partially obscured by the wave in front of it. Heading right for them. Hanover finds the two grenades. Gives one to Pantucci. They rip the pins out and toss the grenades behind them. Then HAUL ASS faster. The Tentacle right behind them. A BEAT. And then the GRENADES EXPLODE, BA-WOOM! BA-WOOM!
CANTON: Oh my God, it's going to sink. Then slowly, Canton gets a gleam in his eye, now thrilled.
CANTON (CONT'D): It's going to sink.
TRILLIAN: I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
FINNEGAN: Keep tasting... Finnegan shoves the pulse rifle to the ceiling. And blasts away until part of the ceiling falls out and into the water. There's just enough room between two metal beams to get out. The rising WATER SHOVES them up through the hole.
PANTUCCI: They're catchin' up! They're catchin' up! We gotta slow 'em down!
HANOVER: Feed them. That'll slow them down. A black STRIATED MUSCLE ROILS out of the foamy water, then quickly VANISHES under it, heading straight for them.
PANTUCCI: Feed 'em?!! Okay! All right! Feed 'em what? WHAT ARE WE GONNA FEED 'EM?! Hanover takes his pistol and SHOOTS Pantucci in the leg, BLAM! Pantucci SCREAMS. FALLS into the water. Hanover RUNS on. Pantucci doesn't even have time to deal with the pain. He starts SCRAMBLING through the water. UNDERWATER, the INKY FORMS RACE AFTER HIM. Only meters away. Pantucci throws himself into the opening of a dumbwaiter. SLAMS the DOOR SHUT. The TENTACLE ATTACKS the door. WORMING its way across the surface, trying to find a way inside. Pantucci is scared beyond his pain. Pushing back as far as he can against the rear wall, he sees the control button. He presses the up arrow. The dumbwaiter starts to move.
"THE FUJI MARU - YOUR FUN SHIP": In the dark, Trillian trips. She falls to the slippery, waterlogged deck, and SCREAMS...
TRILLIAN: ...clawing at her face... Finnegan pulls her hands from her face...and the thing that attached itself there...a small squid from the shattered aquarium.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): (freaked) Ah...ah...ah... Tries to catch her breath.
FINNEGAN: It's OK...it's not one of them... it's from the aquarium...it's... And then it dawns on Finnegan.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): It's not them...it's it...
TRILLIAN: What?
FINNEGAN: You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this... He holds up the squid.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): ...can't exert that kind of pressure... And the way it tracked us? A million little things don't carry portable phones to coordinate positions... What's chasing us... it's one...thing...one giant... thing.
HANOVER (V.O.): Help!! Help!! Pantucci limps around the bar, down a row of one armed bandits... rounds a corner, comes face-to-face with Hanover. Hanover's eyes are filled with terror and despair. His face is badly constricted. His body paralyzed. He clings to a black-jack table as a Tentacle-Sac drinks its way up his leg. It's already to his hip. He grasps desperately for his pistol, just beyond his reach on the floor. This guy ain't gonna survive. PANTUCCI YELPS and quickly back away, eyes wide, totally tense. He looks around, sees that there's only one Tentacle, and it's completely occupied with devouring Hanover. Pantucci is wigged, but manages to lock eyes with Hanover. Then he looks at the Sac, filled with regurgitated flesh.
PANTUCCI: ...even you don't deserve this. Pantucci picks up Hanover's pistol. Then slowly, cautiously, he creeps forward, and sticks the gun into Hanover's
PANTUCCI (CONT'D): I'm sorry man... He turns and quickly limps off. Hanover's EYES look down at the gun in his hand. Then, with all the strength he has left, he slowly, painfully, turns the pistol so it points at his head. CLOSE ON: Hanover's trembling FINGER. As it slowly squeezes the trigger. He want to kill himself. Needs to hill himself. He squeezes harder. The TRIGGER DEPRESSES! -- CLICK! The gun is empty. Hanover's mouth opens in a horrible, silent scream.
FINNEGAN: Will somebody give me a break here? And that's when Finnegan and Trillian hear the SOUND of a HYDRAULIC HOIST. They look over --
TRILLIAN: Wait! Stop! The boat touches down into the water.
CANTON: I'd like to but I have an appointment with my insurance broker! He HITS the HOIST-RELEASE BUTTON. The speedboat breaks free. Canton HITS the IGNITION. The boat's ENGINE ROARS.
CANTON (CONT'D): Life takes the damndest turns, doesn't it? He red-lines the THROTTLE. The SPEEDBOAT HAULS ASS away from the cruiseliner. Canton steers for the island. Smiling. ANGLE ON: Trillian
TRILLIAN: You son of a bitch!! She grabs Finnegan's pulse rifle, hefts it to her shoulder...
FINNEGAN: Look! He forces her to look in the distance. Their POV. The island.
TRILLIAN: Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
FINNEGAN: Not like him. Finnegan points to the water...and an INKY PSEUDOPOD FORM racing after the speedboat underwater.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): It's the engine...it can hear the engine...it goes for the loudest sound... The Tentacle quickly picks up speed, going faster and faster, getting closer and closer, stretching further and further. Suddenly, behind them, a METALLIC THRASHING SOUND is HEARD. They turn around and look -- The hook, the tow-line, and the entire railing have dropped down onto the watersports platform and are tangled up around the two jet skis, trying to tear free -- The Saipan is still clinging by its fingernails to the Fuji Maru! Finnegan races over to a WINCH and grabs the winch- line.
CANTON: Oh we sail the ocean blue, and our mighty ship's a beauty. We are strong men, yes it's true, and responsive to our duty... When...YANK!!...the SPEEDBOAT is GRABBED from below, practically exploding as it DISINTEGRATES into TWO PIECES. Canton is PROPELLED through the windscreen and onto the hood.
FINNEGAN: Hit it! Hit it! The HOOK and the TOW-LINE drop -- then SNAP TAUGHT as the winch-line holds them tight. Trillian throws the start lever on the winch. The WINCH KICKS ON and starts reeling in the Saipan. Finnegan tries to crawl up on the deck, exhausted. Trillian reaches down and pulls him the rest of the way up. He half collapses on top of her.
TRILLIAN: You know, Finnegan, I'm starting to believe what you said about you not being born to die on a luxury liner. Despite the grimness of their position, the closeness of their bodies is...a turn on...to both of them...and then a SCREAM from the sea. They look in the direction of...
CANTON: No! No! No! All the tentacles rise over him, about to descend.
TRILLIAN: (quietly) Finnegan...
FINNEGAN: Yeah...
TRILLIAN: ...the minute you start your engines ...it's going to kill us, isn't it? They step up to one of the big CRATES. Finnegan starts SMASHING it with the butt of his pulse-rifle. The CRATE BURST OPEN. REVEALING the WARHEAD of the torpedo. Trillian is stunned.
FINNEGAN: Not unless we kill it first. Finnegan SMASHES more of the CRATE, it falls apart, REVEALING the entire torpedo. He hands her his pulse rifle.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Anything moves, you shoot. Finnegan starts to yank open the top plates of the missile head. Trillian looks around nervously.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
TRILLIAN: If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
FINNEGAN: Jet ski...there's one left up there. The plate comes loose. Revealing a gaggle of wires, and parts.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): ...let's see, it was red wire cross compressor blue wire...or blue cross red? He starts to fiddle with the wires. -- Suddenly, there's a LOUD SLOSHING SOUND right behind them! CRATES TOPPLE! More pulse rifles spill out. Trillian spins, ready to blast away with the pulse rifle, to...
PANTUCCI: Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
FINNEGAN: Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red... He refers to the wires.
PANTUCCI: Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
FINNEGAN: Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
PANTUCCI: (fast) Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
FINNEGAN: Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
PANTUCCI: For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
TRILLIAN: How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
FINNEGAN: Right...
PANTUCCI: Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
FINNEGAN: Seafood salad. (to Trillian) You ever operate a jet ski?
TRILLIAN: (nervous) You want ME to go up there?
FINNEGAN: Not unless you can wire a missile or fix an engine.
TRILLIAN: And what if I run into one of those things? Finnegan tosses her a pulse rifle from the overturned crate.
FINNEGAN: Don't forget the safety. She hits the safety, slams a shell into chamber...
TRILLIAN: Don't take too long...I'm not planning on being on the menu tonight. ...and exits.
PANTUCCI: (razzing) I've never seen you so congenial with a member of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
FINNEGAN: And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening. Finnegan attaches a wire to a sprocket. A red light starts to blink on the warhead.
TRILLIAN: I'm going to be OK...I'm going to be OK... The ship's METAL HULL SCREECHES. The SEAWATER BUBBLES and GURGLES. From somewhere deep inside the ship, we HEAR that loud primordial YOWL again. Trillian freezes, her heart double beats. She looks around, really scared.
PANTUCCI: You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
FINNEGAN: A little to the left...
PANTUCCI: I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
FINNEGAN: Line it up now, nice and easy... The missile head is right in line with the hole in the bow.
PANTUCCI: I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
FINNEGAN: I have been.
PANTUCCI: And what have you come up with?
FINNEGAN: How does an island sound to you? Pantucci looks at Finnegan quizically. This is news to him.
PANTUCCI: I gerry-rigged the ignition...all you gotta do is start her up...it won't go fast but it'll go loud... Trillian's scream tears through the night. Finnegan's eyes go to the Fuji Maru. He kicks open a box by the side of the console, and pulls out a sawed off shot gun with a pistol handle in a holster.
PANTUCCI (CONT'D): Man, don't go up there...
FINNEGAN: One whistle... Start the engine... Finnegan slams shells into the shotgun.
PANTUCCI: She's gone...
FINNEGAN: Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
PANTUCCI: All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
FINNEGAN: You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey? Finnegan hefts a pulse rifle, and runs out of the pilothouse.
TRILLIAN: Finnegan! Trillian looks back. Sees the Tentacles coming out of the darkness of the web. Twenty feet back and closing.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): Hurry!! Hurry!! Finnegan runs up and grabs her. Tries to pull her free. But she's stuck good. He looks behind her to the tentacles quickly closing in on her. Now fifteen feet away.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): Get me out of here!! As she struggles, Finnegan pulls out his knife, and starts to hack away at the sticky webbing. Trillian tries to look behind her.
FINNEGAN: Don't look!! Push!! Trillian struggles with every last ounce of her strength. Now ten feet away.
TRILLIAN: Finnegan hacks away with desperate urgency. Now five feet.
FINNEGAN: Grab my hands!! Finnegan plunges his hands into the goo. Trillian latches onto Finnegan's wrists, he onto hers. Four feet.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Push!! Push!! Finnegan strains, pulling, until every muscle in his body keens with the effort, every vein pops to the surface. Trillian pushes for all she is worth. Three feet...two feet...one foot...
BOTH: With a last gargantuan effort, Finnegan yanks...Trillian comes tearing out of the webbing...the remnants of her gown doesn't...in the nick of time. The tentacle rushes forward. Finnegan jams his pulse-rifle into the web and OPENS FIRE. Blasting the entire clip into the goo. Tearing the shit out of it. BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!!!!!! And that's when the whole ROOM starts to QUAKE. And SHAKE! Finnegan and Trillian both look down at their feet as they hear the LOWER DECKS EXPLODING UPWARD, one at a time -- BAM! - BAM! -- BAM! Something is rising up through the ship. He grabs Trillain and pulls her toward the exit. She scoops her fallen pulse rifle off the floor.
FINNEGAN: Go! Go! Go! He shoves her out the door, and is about to follow when the door is slammed shut in his face.
TRILLIAN (V.O.): Finnegan!!!
FINNEGAN: Get to the jet ski! Go!
FINNEGAN: Get a good look... In SLOW-MOTION, Finnegan lifts his pulse-rifle. It DRIPS WATER. He jams the gun-butt into his hip. Takes aim -- FIRES! But he only gets off one quick BURST before a TENTACLE LASHES OUT and GRABS him. JERKS him into the air. His pulse-rifle goes flying. Finnegan is being dragged toward the hole into the floor, and the death that awaits him. He struggles to free himself as the hole looms closer, closer. He is about to disappear down the hole of no return, when his hand comes up with his knife. He slashes the tentacle in two, scrambles up and heads for an open door. As he reaches the door, a tentacle rises up in front of him. Huge. Blocking his way. It's maw opens wide. A terrifying sight of jaws and teeth and death. About to devour him. As it strikes forward, Finnegan draws his shotgun, and blasts the vile thing to smithereens. He bolts through the door, several Tentacles already after him.
TRILLIAN: Oh my God, oh my God. Suddenly, twenty feet from the jet ski, SOMETHING SWIRLS through the water. Trillian aims her pulse-rifle at it. Eyes wide. Knuckles white. Breathing hard. WHAMM!! Something drops onto the ski behind her.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D): She turns, ghost white...to Finnegan.
FINNEGAN: I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
TRILLIAN: Soon as I get over the heart attack... Finnegan whistles. Waits. No engine goes on. He whistles again. Still no response. Removes his watch, gives it to Trillian.
FINNEGAN: Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
TRILLIAN: No...
FINNEGAN: You don't take orders very well, do you?
TRILLIAN: I don't take orders at all.
FINNEGAN: This time, make an exception. He grabs Trillian's pulse rifle, and leaps up on the side of the Saipan, and scales up to the deck. Trillian watches him, and then looks at the watch.
FINNEGAN: Pantucci!... JOEY! Then he spots something on the floor. He reaches down and picks it up. It's Pantucci's leather tool belt. It's been RIPPED TO SHREDS. Finnegan stares at it. His grip tightening. Tears rising in his eyes. His jaw clenching. Then he flings the belt aside. Filled with rage.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Time to die, motherfucker. Finnegan hits the ignition button. A desperate moment of dry cranking ...and then the one remaining engine catches, sputters, and fires to life.
TRILLIAN: Where's you friend?
FINNEGAN: He's not coming... The Saipan strains on its leashes. ENGINES GUNNING. Finnegan swings his rifle around. OPENS UP on the tie-lines. All the TIE-LINES SHRED. The Saipan starts to break free.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Hold on! He GUNS the ski...and it stalls. The jet ski stalls. Goes dead in the water.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Oh shit!! Nearby, the WATER SWIRLS violently. He hammers the starter button.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Come on!! The ENGINE STUTTERS. He tries again.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D): Come on!! Another STUTTER. More WATER SWIRLS, getting closer now. But the third time's a charm. The jet ski comes to life and shoots off along the side of the ship. Just as a tentacle comes shooting out of the water. Finnegan fires at it, blowing it to pieces. The last TIE-LINE SNAPS. The SAIPAN LURCHES AWAY from the Fuji Maru. The jammed steering-sticks force the rudder to turn it in a tight circle.
BOUNCING HARD.: Trillian can't hold on. Flips off the back. Skips across the water. Finnegan ROARS away. A tentacle hard on his ass. Trillian pops to the surface. Treads water. Panicked. Watches Finnegan and the jet ski leaving her behind. Finnegan looks back at Trillian. Bobbing in the water. The he looks at the Saipan. Continuing its arc. Its deadly payload racing for the Fuji Maru. Finnegan CRANKS the HANDLEBARS. SMASHES through a wave and heads for Trillian. Trillian sees him and swims hard. The SAIPAN ROARS straight at the Fuji Maru. The warhead perfectly positioned to strike its hull. Only fifty meters away. Now forty. Now thirty-five.
ENGINES WHINING OUT.: Faster and faster. A HUGE GEYSER OF WATER EXPLODES in front of the jet ski. A tentacle slaps down hard. Finnegan cuts hard. Too late. The JET SKI RAMPS through the geyser. They and the JET SKI TUMBLE and SPLASH across the water. The
SAIPAN CHARGES FORWARD.: Twenty-five meters away from hitting the Fuji Maru. No twenty meters away. Now fifteen. Finnegan pops to the surface. Looks around. Can't find Trillian. He DIVES under the water. His POV: Tentacles converging on him from the murky depths. The "retrieve" feature that's on all jet skis forces it back around towards where Finnegan and Trillian fell off. Finnegan BURST to the surface. Holding Trillian. She looks nearly lifeless. The jet ski heads right at them. Finnegan swims for it. Dragging Trillian. As tentacles converge from all sides. The JET SKI is suddenly SUCKED under the water! Swallowed whole. Finnegan quickly reverses. Backstrokes like mad. The WARHEAD SLICES through the water. Now only ten meters away from hitting the Fuji Maru. Now nine meters away. Now eight. Seven. Six. Five.
BA-WHOOOOOOMMM!!: The SAIPAN EVAPORATES.
WATER SPRAYS.: FIRE FILLS the night sky. The TOP DECK of the Fuji Maru CARTWHEELS across the waves. The Tentacle above Finnegan drops like lead. And just lies there. Quivering. Another EXPLOSION. LIFTS the remains of the FUJI MARU out of the sea. Sends shock waves across the water. Blows Finnegan's hair back. He swims on. Towards the island. Pulling Trillian. The remains of the SAIPAN and the FUJI MARU SMOLDER and SINK. BUBBLES EXPLODE to the surface. A couple dozen small FIRES dot the waves. WATER SIZZLES and STEAMS. SMOKE drifts into the night sky. Debris coats the water.
PANTUCCI: Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
FINNEGAN: Joey...
PANTUCCI: Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
FINNEGAN: Joey...
PANTUCCI: Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
BOTH: Joey!!
PANTUCCI: OK...OK...you don't have to beg me ...I'll stick around... And then they head the most gut-wrenching, spine-tingling, teeth- shattering ROAR ever. Pure primeval. Like no sound or animal or thing we've ever hear beofre. Coming from DEEP
PANTUCCI (CONT'D): Or maybe not... Finnegan, Trillian, and Pantucci slowly turn and look INLAND. We BEGIN TO PULL BACK as they all stand up. MORE STRANGE
NOISES ARE HEARD. FROM MULTIPLE UNKNOWN SPECIES.: WE KEEP PULLING BACK. REVEALING more of this creepy-looking island. And leaving our three heroes stranded on the beach. WE KEEP PULLING BACK. REVEALING pieces of the smoldering ship. Nearly the whole island is VISIBLE now. Dark jungles. Craggy mountains. Maybe the scariest-looking place on earth.
FINNEGAN (V.O.): What now... The "THING" ROARS again. It's hellacious.
