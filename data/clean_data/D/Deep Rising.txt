FINNEGAN: How we doing out there?
PANTUCCI: ( singing ) " if not for the courage of the fearless crew "
PANTUCCI!!: Unperturbed, Pantucci works at the wires.
PANTUCCI: ( into radio ) Can we use our indoor voice ( radio filtered ) I'm flying blind here God damn it!
PANTUCCI: You trying to make me feel guilty?
FINNEGAN: Guilty will be the least of what you feel when I run my rig into one of these god damn no name islands! Get me well here!
PANTUCCI: All better.
PANTUCCI: .why we took this job?
FINNEGAN: If I told you once.I told you a thousand times.
PANTUCCI: ( rote ) I know.I know.if the cash is there we don't care. ( nervous ) Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried.
HANOVER: You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out.smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese.what did we use to call Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two.are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
FINNEGAN: Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two.are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
HANOVER: No, it just struck me as odd.I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
FINNEGAN: You know what they say.the classics are eternal.
HANOVER: So where are we?
FINNEGAN: Right here.middle of nowhere.
HANOVER: And where is our point of arrival?
FINNEGAN: Right here.middle of nowhere.and the answer to your question is yes.
HANOVER: Which question is that?
FINNEGAN: The one you came up to ask.are we on schedule?
HANOVER: ( to Mason ) Take note Mr. Mason.this is why you hire a professional.No whining. No excuses.
MASON: ( attitude ) I've heard a lot of stories about you mate.
FINNEGAN: All of them flattering I'm sure.
MASON: They were.but they musta been talking about another Finnegan. because the one I heard about was as rough as they came.the one I'm looking at is, well, about as current as the music.
HANOVER: Don't mind him Finnegan.you remember 25.balls of steel. splashing around in a sea of I don't mind him.but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the And who's gonna make me? The Finnegan you heard about.

HANOVER: That's why we're sill around Finnegan.you and me. Nothing gets the feathers up. Business is business. Eh?
FINNEGAN: And the classics are eternal.
OLD WOMAN: He said an orchid and a beautiful woman belonged together. It was our first date. He said that it was the orchid I wore that made him fall in love with me.
TRILLIAN: He sounds like a real gentleman.
OLD WOMAN: The best of the best he was. This cruise was supposed to be our 60th anniversary gift to each other. He died last Spring.
TRILLIAN: I'm so sorry.
OLD WOMAN: I was going to wear one.special for him.like a memory.
TRILLIAN: Because an orchid and a beautiful woman belong together.
CROWD: Forever!! Here! Here!
TRILLIAN: ( French ) Is it true what they say about a captain and his boat.
CAPTAIN: Is what true madame?
TRILLIAN: ( French ) Madamoiselle.that the bigger the boat.the bigger the man.
CAPTAIN: It is a theory I would be glad to put to the test. In school, the Sisters said testing was my specialty.
TRILLIAN: ( French ) In school, the Sisters said testing was my specialty.
PASSENGER: Driven to distraction, The Captain turns his attention for a moment to a passenger introducing his wife.
CAPTAIN: ANGLE ON: Trillian, turning from the captain into the crowd. C.U. on her hand by the side of her dress. A man's wallet held surreptitiously. Her fingers open the wallet, extract a thin gold card with a black stripe. She discards the wallet, keeps the card, and disappears into the crowd.
CANTON: You wanted to see me Captain?
CAPTAIN: We have a storm rising behind us. we may have to close the canopy, I hope it doesn't ruin your party.
CANTON: ( self-satisfied ) Ruin my party? Captain, this ship was built to withstand a typhoon. I can't imagine there's anything on the sea today that could possibly ruin my party.
PANTUCCI: ( whispers )
LEILA: Gum kwa she bam dok.
FINNEGAN: It's not noise.it's genius.
FINNEGANNNN!!: Followed by the unmistakable sound of fist hitting flesh. Finnegan and Leila trade a look.
MULLIGAN: You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
VIVO: You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN.or like made up countries too?
MULLIGAN: What the hell does that mean?
VIVO: Like Mamooli's country.
MAMOOLI: What you talkin'? Samoa's a county!
VIVO: It's a dot on a map.

PANTUCCI: Finnegan turns his gaze to Pantucci. It makes the smaller man Finnegan stalks off. Pantucci swallows hard, knowing he means 32 FUJI MARU - NIGHT 32 A man strides down the hall of an executive passageway, his face obscured in shadows. He has a CANISTER in his hands. Walks through a door MARKED:

FINNEGAN: Hold still now.I was like three rows back.
PANTUCCI: You don't give a shit about anything do you?
FINNEGAN: Sure I do.I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of destination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.

FINNEGAN: Finnegan locks the sticks down, and runs out.
PANTUCCI: What did you do to my kids!!
FINNEGAN: No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing? What happened?
PANTUCCI: No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing? What happened?
HANOVER: What happened?
FINNEGAN: We ran into a speedboat.
HANOVER: How soon can we get up and running?
FINNEGAN: We can't.we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.

HANOVER: I'd say that's a pretty good You know the crew could be armed.
PANTUCCI: ( nervous ) You know the crew could be armed.
HANOVER: With what? Martinis and tanning
HANOVER: Synchronize watches.
LEILA: ( angry ) Kwan bat! Kwam bat! Booom!!
BILLY: ( bothered )
LEILA: She ignites her torch, is about to flick her visor down again when a loud gurgling, a sucking sound, stops her. She cuts the torch. Looks around nervously.and then she spots the suction hose sucking away. She smiles to herself. Flips the visor, fires the torch, and goes back to work.
PANTUCCI: You'd think they'd set a deck
MULLIGAN: I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
VIVO: Maybe plans changed.
MULLIGAN: Plans don't change.
PANTUCCI: Maybe it's the wrong ship.
MULLIGAN: Shut up!
FINNEGAN: Let's just keep going.
MULLIGAN: ( nervous ) You ain't giving the orders here!
MASON: What the.
HANOVER: Focus on the task Mr. Chin.
HANOVER: What the hell is going on?
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Next stop, Chinatown!
FINNEGAN: Guys!! Whoa! WHOA! WHOA! WHOOOAAA!!
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Next stop, Fisherman's Wharf. This is Red One.status report.
FINNEGAN: ( into radio ) Your boys just killed a trolley car Red One.
MULLIGAN: ( into radio ) We been down three decks, there's nobody home. Total spooky-town. Advise on how to proceed.
HANOVER: Stay to the schedule. Stay to the plan. Nothing has changed.
TRILLIAN: The SOUND slowly MOVES across the wall. Then another WALL starts to GURGLE. Trillian spins around. She forces herself not to panic. Very cautiously, taking small measured steps she reaches the handle to the freezer, and tries to open it. No go. The gurgling ripples above her. Her mouth goes dry as her eyes follow the sound across the ceiling. Her hand goes to her hair. She pulls her lock pick out, and very slowly kneels down until she is eye level with the door lock. She begins to pick her way out, her ears and eyes following the gurgling above. Suddenly the sound stops. The silence makes Trillian's heart sound that much louder. She sidles close to the wall.
WHAMM!!: Something slams against the wall from the other side in response. Trillian falls back against the door, her heart in her throat.
PANTUCCI: ( rattling, nervous ) You know what I'm gonna do after this.I'm gonna get a normal ( calm ) .Like a house in the suburbs. maybe a couple of kids.some sort of business.be in the bowling league.go to the ball games. Joey.it's okay.
FINNEGAN: ( calm ) .Like a house in the suburbs. maybe a couple of kids.some sort of business.be in the bowling league.go to the ball games. Joey.it's okay.

FINNEGAN: Joey.it's okay.
PANTUCCI: What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
FINNEGAN: Joey.look at me.
PANTUCCI: Suddenly, overhead, something black and veiny skitters across the mass of pipes, so fast it shocks Pantucci back into the He and Vivo spin their guns at the pipes. The red dots of their laser sights sweep the shadowy web of metal. Nothing.
MULLIGAN: What the.???
PANTUCCI: ( quiet )
FINNEGAN: It's okay.come on.
PANTUCCI: ( scared ) I'm stuck.
MULLIGAN: ( jumpy ) Hey! What are you trying to pull!
PANTUCCI: ( pleading ) Relax your arms.slowly.that's
FINNEGAN: Relax your arms.slowly.that's
MULLIGAN: What the.
LEILA: The KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK of the PUMP is like a loud scary HEARTBEAT. Leila removes her blast visor. Wipes her brow. A MANGLED CORPSE GUSHES IN through the gaping hole! LEILA SCREAMS. Bloody murder. Scared shitless. Quickly backs away. Actually, it's only half a corpse. The bottom half having been eaten away. It's wearing a tuxedo. The corpse's face is tightly constricted, eyes wide open, a grotesque death mask. Leila shakes like a leaf, waist-deep in seawater.
BILLY: ( into radio ) I dunno where they came from, turned around and there they were. ( pause ) No, no passengers. ( pause ) No shit I'll keep my eyes open.
FINNEGAN: The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable.
MULLIGAN: So.If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
FINNEGAN: So.If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
MULLIGAN: Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
PANTUCCI: Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
MULLIGAN: 'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head.
VIVO: What I want to know is why the goddamn ocean is always cold.since I'm a kid I hate god damn cold water.
MULLIGAN: ( nervous ) What was that?
VIVO: Someone's back there.
MULLIGAN: Someone's back there.
VIVO: Hey! Come out here!
MULLIGAN: Check it out!
VIVO: Hey! You hear me? Come out! Still no response.
MULLIGAN: Will you check it the hell out!!
VIVO: Man this shit is cold! I'm gonna kick your ass for putting me through this.
MULLIGAN: What is it man?
VIVO: I'm looking.
MULLIGAN: Vivo!! Vivo!!
PANTUCCI: Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
MULLIGAN: What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
TRILLIAN: She shrugs, must be her imagination. From inside her low cut dress she pulls the Captain's gold security card. She is about to run it through the reader slot when.
TRILLIAN: ( recovering ) I'm sorry. This area is for authorized personnel only. As the assistant to the Purser, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to vacate.
HANOVER: Where is everybody?
TRILLIAN: What do you mean?
HANOVER: ( threatening ) I mean.where is everybody?
TRILLIAN: Hanover grabs Trillian by the throat and slams her against the wall. He rams his gun against her forehead.
HANOVER: You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
TRILLIAN: ( choking ) A passenger.
HANOVER: Where are the other passengers?
MASON: Forget her.let's get what we came for and get the hell out of here!
HANOVER: Mulligan?? What?? I can't hear you?? Repeat I.
CANTON: Oh my God. I didn't mean to.
HANOVER: Stand down soldier! I said. Stand down!!
CANTON: I didn't mean to! I though it was one of them!
HANOVER: One of who?!
MULLIGAN: Hanover!.Hanover! Come in! Come in you son-of-a-bitch!
FINNEGAN: Forget them.
MULLIGAN: ( fried ) Shut up! You hear me!!
FINNEGAN: .we gotta get outta here NOW.
MULLIGAN: Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
PANTUCCI: What's there to think about?? That THING back there.
MULLIGAN: There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and.
FINNEGAN: Grab the parts!!
HANOVER: This is Red one! Come in Red two!
CANTON: ( panicked ) It's them! We've got to get off! Let's find them!
HANOVER: Let's find them!
CHIN: What about the vault?
HANOVER: It's not going anywhere.
PANTUCCI: Finnegan, what the hell was that?
FINNEGAN: I don't know.you got what we If I don't, I ain't going back to get it.you think we're safe?

TRILLIAN: Up!! I want to go up!
PANTUCCI: OWWW!! OOWWW!!!
OWWW!! OOWWW!!!: Trillian tries to run out. Finnegan grabs her.
TRILLIAN: I'm not staying here!
FINNEGAN: It ain't any better out there!
OWW!: Just then, the doors to the elevator shut, and the car starts to ascend.
TRILLIAN: Now look what you did!
FINNEGAN: I saved your life is what I did!
TRILLIAN: Who asked you to!
PANTUCCI: What the hell's going on here?
TRILLIAN: You're with that other bunch, What other bunch?
FINNEGAN: What other bunch?
TRILLIAN: The thieves.
FINNEGAN: I'm not a thief.
TRILLIAN: Then who are you?
FINNEGAN: I'm their ride.
TRILLIAN: You have a boat?
PANTUCCI: Trillian and Finnegan turn to Pantucci who is looking down at the floor where a mass of yellow slime has dripped from the ceiling. All look up to the yellow goo dripping from the ceiling.followed by a sucking sound.
TRILLIAN: It's up there!!
FINNEGAN: Not anymore.
HANOVER: Where are my men?
FINNEGAN: Chin charges Finnegan, the butt of his rifle raised to smash Finnegan's skull. Finnegan parries and drives Chin into the rear wall of the elevator. Mamooli jumps Finnegan from behind, wrapping his rifle against Finnegan's throat. Pantucci jumps on Mamooli's massive back, ripping at his face. Finnegan drops, buries his elbow in Mamooli's solar plexus, spins, and has his knife out of his boot and at Mamooli's throat in a flash. ANGLE ON: Trillian. Impressed. She had no idea.
CHIN: Chin charges Finnegan, the butt of his rifle raised to smash Finnegan's skull. Finnegan parries and drives Chin into the rear wall of the elevator.

FINNEGAN: Because you know a message can't be
HANOVER: Canton flashes Hanover a look. The Captain is confused. Trillian suddenly GRABS CANTON, spins him around and SLAMS him against the hull.
TRILLIAN: How the hell do we fix it?!

HEELLPP!!: CUT TO:
CAPTAIN: Help me!
FINNEGAN: Grab his hands!!
CAPTAIN: CANTON!! HELP!!
CANTON!! HELP!!: Canton backs away from the Captain, as the Captain's struggle draws him further into the web. The Captain's eyes bulge, horrified, as he feels SOMETHING inside the spider web GRAB him from behind.
HURRRRRTTTTTSSSS!!!: He struggles WILDLY. Then starts to freeze up as the tentacles wrap around him. Finnegan and Trillian race across the floor as the Captain is slowly sucked deeper into the spider web; his face and body bady constricting, paralyzed. His VOICE is CHOKED OFF. Hanover, Chin, Mamooli and Pantucci burst out of another alleyway. Finnegan and Trillian reach the Captain just as his FACE is SUCKED into the gelatinous web. They skid to a stop. Everybody piles up. Eyes wide. Watching as the Captain's body is pulled deeper into the dark web. Tentacles enveloping him.
HANOVER: ( to Canton ) Where is the closest hatch?
CANTON: I never meant for anyone to get hurt .it was supposed to be You hypocritical bastard.all you gave a shit about was the money. where's the hatch!!

MAMOOLI: Everyone turn to. A giant ball of black, wet, OOZING RUBBER UNDULATES down the gangway. Coming straight at them. A mass of glistening striated MUSCLE.
HANOVER: The three men open up with their pulse rifles. The CREATURE gets RIPPED TO SHREDS. Red and blue INK-BLOOD SPLATTERS everywhere. But onward it comes. Down the gangway. Trillian grabs the pistol off Chin's utility belt, and opens fire. Canton jumps into the water and disappears.
FINNEGAN: You O.K.?
TRILLIAN: ( grim ) Finders keepers.
MAMOOLI: Where's Chin?
TRILLIAN: This is not real! This is not bloody real!
MAMOOLI: This is not real! This is not bloody real!

MAMOOLI: I say we stay right here!
PANTUCCI: Are you crazy?
MAMOOLI: ( desperate ) There's plenty of food here. We can hold out.someone'll rescue us.
FINNEGAN: Someone.maybe they sent an SOS!
MAMOOLI: Someone.maybe they sent an SOS!
PANTUCCI: On what? This son of a bitch zapped the communications.
HANOVER: Mamooli stand down!
MAMOOLI: We don't even know if his boat is still there.you saw Billy!
FINNEGAN: Boat or no boat.I'm going.
MAMOOLI: They're wipin' us out one at a time. I say we make a stand. Right here! Right now! Maximum firepower!
PANTUCCI: Somebody shoot this jerk!
FINNEGAN: ( calm ) Nobody's shooting nobody.come on, just let us through the hatch!
MAMOOLI: I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
FINNEGAN: I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that What the hell are you talking Us.I'm talking about us. We're the fish.
MAMOOLI: What the hell are you talking Us.I'm talking about us. We're the fish.
FINNEGAN: Us.I'm talking about us. We're the fish.
MAMOOLI: And what? These things are I don't know what these things are .all I know is.
FINNEGAN: I don't know what these things are .all I know is.
MAMOOLI: What.? What??
EEEEYYYYYAAAAHHHH!!!!: He opens fire, emptying his clip into the tentacle. The tentacle retreats into the pipes. Mamooli looks around. The room is empty. He runs out.
MAMOOLI: CUT TO:

PANTUCCI: What the hell is going on!!
FINNEGAN: They're herding us.

CANTON: Do we have to go there?
TRILLIAN: What's the matter?
FINNEGAN: The quiet.
HANOVER: Maybe we lost them.
FINNEGAN: Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
TRILLIAN: What is it?
FINNEGAN: A meat locker.
TRILLIAN: We can't just leave them here.
CANTON: I can.
PANTUCCI: Oh no.oh God please no.
FINNEGAN: We can't do anything for them. Let's go.
TRILLIAN: Her rage rises. She hefts her rifle, and starts blasting Spitting FLAMES and SMOKE. The BULLETS IMPACT the gelatin. BLASTING IT AWAY. But the bullets only manage to go about twenty feet into the thick shit before gliding to a stop. GELATIN EXPLODES all over the place. TRACER HOLES STREAK through the stuff. But all the bullets are sliding short.
NOOO!!: Her rage rises. She hefts her rifle, and starts blasting Spitting FLAMES and SMOKE. The BULLETS IMPACT the gelatin. BLASTING IT AWAY.

FINNEGAN: Keep tasting.
PANTUCCI: They're catchin' up! They're catchin' up! We gotta slow 'em Feed them. That'll slow them down.
HANOVER: Feed them. That'll slow them down.
PANTUCCI: Feed 'em?!! Okay! All right! Feed 'em what? WHAT ARE WE GONNA FEED

And SHAKE! Finnegan and Trillian both look down at their feet as they hear the LOWER DECKS EXPLODING UPWARD, one at a time BAM! - BAM! BAM! Something is rising up through the ship. He grabs Trillain and pulls her toward the exit. She scoops her fallen pulse rifle off the floor.
