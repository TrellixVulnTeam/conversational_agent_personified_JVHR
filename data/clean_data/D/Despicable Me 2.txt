Up on top of Gru's house, the minions struggle to lower him down on a rope. Edith's balloon floats by and distracts They let go of the rope and Gru swings wildly, smashing into the wall of the house and crashing to the ground.

They speed through the sea and an octopus slams into her windshield. She turns on the wipers, which hits the octopus in the face until he's had enough and swims off in a cloud of ink. She HONKS her HORN as she passes through a school of fish.
MINIONS: As the fish pass the Minions look ahead to see a shark heading for them with his mouth open. They SCREAM. Lucy quickly steers the car out of harm's way. They pass by several more sharks until they arrive at a GIANT SUBMARINE with the letters "AVL" on the side. A HATCH opens and Lucy's car goes inside. The hatch closes behind her.

LUCY: The lab was devoted to experiments involving PX-41, a transmutation serum. What is PX-41, you ask? Mmmm, it's pretty bad. Look.
GRU: The bunny attacks the technician, then the camera.and the film is over.
SILAS: As you can see, in the wrong hands, the PX-41 serum could be the most devastating weapon on earth. Fortunately it has a very distinct chemical footprint, and using the latest chemtracking technology, we found traces of it in the Paradise

KEVIN: And then Stuart dressed as a little girl with pigtails.
STUART: EXT: MALL - DAY INT: MALL - SAME Gru comes down the escalator wearing the sunglasses, with the three disguised Minions behind him. Stuart gets his dress caught in the escalator. It comes off and he hides in a nearby potted plant. Gru glances at a store called the "EAGLE HAIR CLUB." He then arrives at a charming, pink CUPCAKE STORE. The sign reads, "BAKE MY DAY" Gru frowns and takes off his sunglasses.
GRU: Hm. "Bake My Day." Blech.

LUCY: Well, seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you. But not me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so I kind of have to do what they tell me anyway.
DAVE: Immediately Lucy moves with lightning-quick reflexes. She smashes his cupcake, flips him into the air, and pins him to the counter. Dave SCREAMS.
LUCY: You know this guy?

GRU: Yes, right. You can do that, can't
AGNES: Yeah! I do that all the time! Thanks, Gru!
MINIONS: Pull back to reveal many minions singing and dancing. We move through the crowd, passing by the mace-wielding minion with his helmet still backwards and a smaller server minion with a tray of ice cream sundaes in mugs. We cut up to the rafters, where more minions are dancing and singing in formation, jumping and hopping all over the place in elaborate dance routines. Back on the floor, three arm-in-arm minions take the chorus. One of them clearly having had one too many sundaes is being held up by the other two. Another minion tries to carry empty mugs down a spiral staircase, but he's knocked off by a bunch of minions running up the other way. Several minions sit around a communal bowl of ice cream, lazily sipping at it through long straws. Gru enters and takes it all in. Other minions raid an ice cream cart, hanging from the canopy, drinking directly from the spouts.
GRU: Alright, hey, hey No, no, no, no! Hey, please!
KEVIN: Hey, putt-putt?

He tries to make a break for it, but the truck lowers a popsicle in front of He licks it, his tongue sticks, and he is yanked back into the ice cream cone. The it closes and the truck drives away. The children look on puzzled.

MARGO: Everyone in the restaurant cheers. Gru frowns. Not this The music continues and Eduardo dances across the floor and out into the mall where he grabs a passing SHOPPER and pulls her into the restaurant. The confused woman holds on for the ride as Eduardo twirls and dances her all around the floor. He dips her and she melts, as do all of the women watching. Eduardo gazes into the woman's eyes and produces a business card.
EDUARDO: Kids eat free on Tuesdays.

EDUARDO: You are right, Cabeza de Huevo! They must get to know each other better. Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family to our Cinco de Mayo party?
GRU: No, no, I am
GIRLS: The girls are all thrilled at this, as is Antonio. As if on cue, MUSIC begins playing and they all begin dancing Antonio takes Margo's hand and twirls her across the floor. Gru stares at Antonio with a look that could kill. A waiter comes by to give Gru a party drink, and he promptly crushes the glass with his bare hands. His eye twitches.
SILAS: I'm sorry, El Macho? Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect? After the whole salsa incident?
GRU: Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy. You need to arrest him immediately. And his deviously charming son. I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too. The son also. You've got to get the son.
SILAS: Yes, but I don't really see any evidence for
GRU: Evidence schmevidence! I go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho! Lock him up! Lock up the son. Don't forget about the son. The kid gives me the creeps!
SILAS: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
LUCY: Uh, but, on the less. ."crazy" side of things, uh, Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club.
SILAS: Hm. Interesting.
LUCY: Yeah, and you know who made that happen? Huh? This guy. Nailed it. Amazing, No. I mean, sure, but it's not him. It is. .El Macho.

POPSICLE MINION: The Popsicle Minion, now nude, runs across the sand and jumps into a clear, blue ocean. We pull back to reveal that unbeknownst to any of the minions, this is all happening inside a large terrarium, and they are being watched by a mysterious figure in silhouette.
