REVIE: I'm just going to make a brief CAPTION: "JULY 4th, 1974" REVIE stands under a large trophy cabinet, filled with the silverware he has won. REPORTERS wait: intimidated. Cowed. Yesterday afternoon at 3.00, I accepted the FA's offer to become the next manager of the England national football team. A gasp among the JOURNALISTS. A burst of flashlights. The BOARD MEMBERS look down at the floor in silence. Bereaved fathers losing their favourite son. Obviously that involves me leaving Leeds United after 13 happy and successful years, which makes me very sad. I'd like to think I have built the club into a family and there must be sadness when anybody leaves a family. However, when one man goes, another steps into his place. I know who I think that person should be, the man to replace me, and I shall make my feelings clear to the directors. Thank you. No further comments. REVIE turns and walks out, a volley of REPORTERS shouting We're in a car. Tarmac passes beneath us. Roadmarkings. OVER THIS: the sound of a flat Teeside voice, singing along with Frank Sinatra on the radio.
CLOUGH: ( singing ) "And let me play among the stars.."
SIMON: When are we there?
CLOUGH: Any moment now. On the right. "Let me see what spring is like." The car turns a bend, and suddenly the floodlights and stands of a football stadium come into view. The BOYS' eyes widen.
BOY 1: There it is! Dad! There it is! The BOYS smile in excitement.
CLOUGH: ( singing ) "..on Jupiter and Mars.."
BOY 1: Where are you going? Dad? You've missed it.
CLOUGH: We've something else to do first. Won't take long.
MITCHELL: Today we welcome Brian Clough as he starts his new job as manager of Leeds United, taking over from Don Revie - the most successful manager in the club's history, under whom Leeds have won everything..
CLOUGH: ..not QUITE everything. Not won the European Cup.
MITCHELL: .but pretty much everything else. Daunted? Not at all, Austin. Looking forward to it.
CLOUGH: Daunted? Not at all, Austin. Looking forward to it.
MITCHELL: The biggest challenge of your life, and you'll be without Peter Taylor, for the first time. Your lifelong professional colleague.
CLOUGH: Yes, Pete's at Brighton now. He had the opportunity to come with me, but Brighton was his choice. Leeds was A surprising choice, some might say. Because you've been very vocal in your criticism of them over the years.
MITCHELL: A surprising choice, some might say. Because you've been very vocal in your criticism of them over the years.
CLOUGH: I have.
MITCHELL: You've accused players of dirty tactics, cheating, dissent, foul play. You called Norman Hunter, Norman "Bites yer legs" Hunter, you've said Peter Lorimer falls when no one touches him.
CLOUGH: And I was right.
MITCHELL: I'm curious. Why do you now show such alacrity to joining them after such vituperative criticism of them for so Goodness, it's going to take me half an hour to explain all those words for a start. Laughter from the camera CREW.. Football is a beautiful game, Austin. It needs to be played beautifully. I think Leeds have sold themselves CLOUGH's interview continues on a TV in a sitting-room, where it is being watched by Don Revie, sitting in an armchair.

I think Leeds have sold themselves CLOUGH's interview continues on a TV in a sitting-room, where it is being watched by Don Revie, sitting in an armchair.
CLOUGH: Football clubs are like families, footballers are sensitive people. I'd like to bring a little warmth into the "That type of operation?" I presume you're referring to Don Revie..
4A: 5B CON TINUE D: 5B
MITCHELL: "That type of operation?" I presume you're referring to Don Revie..
CLOUGH: I am..
MITCHELL: ..who has long been regarded as a father figure in Leeds. And now you're coming in as the outsider, the enemy even, after all the things you've said in public, coming in and taking ouver as STEPfather.
MITCHELL: Don't you expect some degree of resentment to this?
CLOUGH: I would accept and expect a strangeness, initially, it's perfectly normal. But it won't be long before they realise I'm a fair man. A kind man. And maybe under me they can experience what it's like to be in a happy family, after all.
MITCHELL: How can you be sure they weren't happy with Don all along?
CLOUGH: They wouldn't have played football that way if they were happy.
JIMMY GORDON: Where have you been, boss? JIMMY GORDON, CLOUGH loyal trainer, his face creased with Directors have been waiting more than an hour. C'mon..
JIMMY: Directors have been waiting more than an hour. C'mon..
5A: 7 CON TINUE D: 7
CLOUGH: Morning lads! Lovely Yorkshire I tell you makes me want to jump on a plane right back to Majorca! CLOUGH laughs. The PLAYERS stare in silence. Squinting in the drizzle. Condensation coming from their mouths. JOHNNY GILES stares. BILLY BREMNER spits and continues talking disrespectfully. Not much of a welcome, was it? And not so much as a smile from Johnny Giles.
JIMMY: You're five days late!! And did you really need to say that about Majorca? You know he was Revie's first choice for getting your job.
CLOUGH: Who? Johnny Giles? CLOUGH looks over at GILES, who turns away, resumes Was he now? And Bremner?
JIMMY: Club Captain. Don's son and heir. His first born. You're never going to get any love from him. BREMNER, a flint-eyed Scot, stares at CLOUGH..
CLOUGH: Great. Here's to happy fucking JIMMY GORDON leads CLOUGH and his BOYS down a corridor, where countless photographs of DON REVIE hang on the walls. Holding They pass an open door, with a sign outside, `MANAGER. Mr. DON. REVIE.' CLOUGH stops. Looks at the sign.

CLOUGH: Any chance of a cup of tea, duck?
JEAN: They're waiting for you. Upstairs. CLOUGH swings his feet on the desk.
CLOUGH: Who's that?
JEAN: The Directors.
CLOUGH: For me? Why?
JEAN: For the board meeting.
CLOUGH: Let them wait. Now, how about that cup of tea? CLOUGH smiles sweetly, but JEAN stares at CLOUGH. She pointedly doesn't move. CLOUGH lowers his feet. All right, I'll go then. Wouldn't want to get off on the wrong foot. CLOUGH walks over to the door. Looks at the desk. Who's desk is that, love?
JEAN: Yours, Mr. Clough.
CLOUGH: Not mine. I didn't put it there, did
I?: Mr. Revie's.
JEAN: Mr. Revie's.
CLOUGH: Let's get rid of it then, shall we? Chairs, too. The whole bloody lot. Think it would be best if there were nothing of his left here. CLOUGH reaches the door.. Were you his secretary?
JEAN: I was. For thirteen happy years.
CLOUGH: What's your name, pet?
JEAN: Jean, Sir. Jean Reid.
CLOUGH: In which case, no offence duck, but there's nothing I want typed on paper from you other than your resignation. She gasps.. And you can change the locks on your way out. Don't want the ghost of troubled Don popping in now, do we? Rattling his chains. Scaring my young CLOUGH puts his arms protectively round the BOYS, and leads them out of the door. JEAN REID stares, visibly shaken.
CUSSINS: Come in, Brian. CLOUGH sits down at the head of the table. Rubs his hands What? No one going to offer me a drink? Like an undertakers in here. The DIRECTORS shoot looks at one another.
CLOUGH: What? No one going to offer me a drink? Like an undertakers in here. The DIRECTORS shoot looks at one another.
CUSSINS: Why did you do it?
CLOUGH: Do what?
BOLTON: The interview. For Yorkshire TV.
CUSSIN: We've had a phone-call.
BOLTON: Not so much a phone-call. Bloody From Don. They only went and rung him. And ran some of your quotes by him. About how unhappy the players were. What "bad champions". Looking for a Bloody got one, as well. He's gone He had it coming. He shouldn't have done that piece in the Mirror should he? Saying he thought I was a daft He's entitled to his opinions.

BOLTON: He's entitled to his opinions.
CLOUGH: And I'm entitled to mine.
CUSSINS: ( barks, flame on ) And I'm entitled to MINE.
CLOUGH: Thank you. I'm the best old one, too.
CUSSINS: .I also did it under the assumption that you'd be coming here wanting the best for the club. For the city of Leeds. So why do I still get the feeling this is all about you and Don?
CLOUGH: Of course it's just about me and Don. Always has been. But instead of putting frowns on your foreheads, o ye elders of Leeds, in your blazers and brass fucking buttons, it should put big white Colgate smiles on your big white faces, because it means I won't sleep and won't eat until I take whatever that man's achieved and beaten it beaten it so I never have to hear the name "Don Fucking Revie" again beat it so the only name anyone sings in their Yorkshire ale houses, raising their stinking jars to their stinking mouths, is Brian Clough. Brian Clough uber fucking alles. Understand?
RADIO ANNOUNCER: ..Ladies and Gentlemen, the draw for the third round of the FA Cup will now CLOUGH's eyes widen: he calls out to the others..

CLOUGH: Put the fish and chips in the bin. Tonight's on Uncle Sam. We're going posh. Chicken fucking bhuna in town. General excitement. Everyone starts putting on their coats.

CLOUGH: Spick and span, understand? Wash these walls down. Give the floors a proper CLOUGH inspects the pitch with the HEAD GROUNDSMAN..
CLOUGH: I want it perfect. Like a fucking carpet. We've got proper footballers coming. Who know how to keep the ball on the deck.
GROUNDSMAN: Well, you can't fucking train on it The Derby PLAYERS train on a football pitch in a public park. CLOUGH turns to TAYLOR..
CLOUGH: You know he'll be making a file on us. A dossier.
TAYLOR: Don Revie. Prepares a file on every game. Leaves nothing to chance. Knows every opponents formations. Strategies. Everything.
CLOUGH: Don Revie. Prepares a file on every game. Leaves nothing to chance. Knows every opponents formations. Strategies. Everything.
TAYLOR: I've heard he's a superstitious twat. Ey..! Help him, someone HELP him..!
CLOUGH: We grew up just a few streets apart, you know. In Middlesborough, close to Ayrsome Park. He'll have known my street, Valley Road - probably bought sweets from Garnetts Factory, where my dad worked.
TAYLOR: Heard he wears the same suit to every game. His "lucky blue suit".
13A: 18 CON TINUE D: 18
CLOUGH: The best manager in the country, Don Revie. Played for Sunderland, like me, as a centre-forward, like me, and England, like me.
TAYLOR: ( shouting out ) C'mon, give it and go!
CLOUGH: Peas in a pod, me and Don. Two peas in a fucking pod.
JIMMY: They're here! Well, almost..
CLOUGH: What are they doing?
JIMMY: They've run out of petrol.
TAYLOR: No, it's that superstition, isn't it? Every away cup ties, Revie makes them walk the last hundred yards. TAYLOR mutters under his breath, "Soppy twat". CLOUGH cranes his neck. Watches DON REVIE, 40's. Thick-set. Severe, forbidding, intimidating, in a huddle with his coaching staff, Les Cocker and Syd Owen. His henchmen. His assassins. His "Goodfellas". His right and left hand. CLOUGH walks towards him. Hand outstretched..
CLOUGH: Welcome to Derby, Don. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Brian Clough. But REVIE walks past without shaking hands, without talking, without even breaking stride.. ..and disappears into the stadium, deep in conversation with Les Cocker and Syd Owen. CLOUGH stares. Hand still outstretched. He looks over at PETER TAYLOR, who can't help smiling, `Forget it'. TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON walk off, but CLOUGH still stares at REVIE in disbelief.
15A: 24 CON TINUE D: ( 2 ) 24
TAYLOR: CLOUGH looks over to REVIE's bench. Sees REVIE and SYD OWEN quietly applauding the Leeds PLAYER. Encouraging more of the same. As the Derby PLAYER is stretchered off.. Presently, RRROOOOAAAARRRRR goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE and his henchmen get to their feet. Applauding. 1-0. TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON immediately start shouting out encouragement to the Derby PLAYERS, new instructions, as the game restarts..
JIMMY: Think, Alan! To feet!
TAYLOR: Now sent it out wide! CLOUGH doesn't join in. He continues to stare at REVIE in his "Beeep!", whistle! Penatly Leeds! CLOUGH leaps off the bench in outrage. Screaming, on his feel, protesting in disbelief..
CLOUGH: What? He didn't fucking touch him! Ref! He DIVED! He fucking dived! REVIE shaking hands with his COLLEAGUES. Smiling amongst themselves. Congratulating themselves. Celebrating. The inevitable roar as Leeds convert, followed by, "Beeeeeep", the sound of the final WHISTLE. CLOUGH stares in disbelief. Robbed. Deflated. The REFEREE blows the whistle for the end of the game. CLOUGH watches as REVIE and SYD OWEN brush past, shaking PETER TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON's hands, ( assuming TAYLOR's the manager ), on their way to the dressing-rooms, their minds already on their next game. CLOUGH stares as they go..
16A: 25 CON TINUE D: 25
CLOUGH: Didn't say good-bye. Or pay me the respect of staying for a drink. Couldn't wait to get away. Through the front door we see: DON REVIE, SYD OWEN and LES COCKER walking to their bus, chuckling to themselves, deep in discussion, already thinking about the next match.
TAYLOR: Bloody cheats and all. Neither of those goals should have been allowed. But CLOUGH doesn't hear.
CLOUGH: Just going to have to beat them, Pete. Beat him it's the last thing I do.
TAYLOR: We need to get into the same division We need someone with a good head. I know. Our lot were like headless chickens out there today. CLOUGH turns to TAYLOR.
CLOUGH: We need someone with a good head. I know. Our lot were like headless chickens out there today. CLOUGH turns to TAYLOR.
TAYLOR: I know. Our lot were like headless chickens out there today. CLOUGH turns to TAYLOR.
CLOUGH: First thing Monday morning, I want you to go and find me that player. A wise TAYLOR opens his mouth, is about to protest.. And don't worry about the money. That's my problem. Just you go and find him. CLOUGH's face: watching the Leeds PLAYERS board the bus.
CLOUGH: Right. Better go and make myself CLOUGH removes his jacket. JIMMY GORDON and CLOUGH's SONS watch as he walks out onto the training pitch.
CLOUGH: ( up-beat, clapping hands ) All right, gentlemen, gather around, I might as well tell you now.
GILES: I don't know what you're talking CLOUGH turns to NORMAN HUNTER.
CLOUGH: But you do, though, "Bites yer Legs".
18A: 27 CON TINUE D: ( 2 ) 27
HUNTER: People kick me, I kick them back.
CLOUGH: Not with me as manager. Do that on my watch, you'll be fined and stuck in the reserves. Things are going to be a little different around here. Without Don. Might feel a little strange at first. Might pinch a little. Like a new pair of shoes. But if you want your grandchildren to remember you for being something other than the dirty buggers you all were, if you want to be loved as REAL champions, WORTHY champions, you're going to have to work. And improve. And change. Now let's start off by playing some PLAYERS stare at one another. Bristling. Disbelieving looks.
BREMNER: Don never did that.
CLOUGH: Well, I'm not Don. And from now on I never want to hear that man's name again. Ever. Next player who mentions it, or what he did or didn't bloody do in the good ol' days, will spend a week cleaning my boots. Seven-a-side. Keep it nice and clean, and sensible. No fifty-fifty's. CLOUGH sees that one side is a man short.. Right, I'll play myself. You might learn something, Irishman. Two hundred and fifty-one goals in two hundred and seventy-four starts. CLOUGH skillfully traps the ball between his feet, flips it up onto this head - down onto his chest, then "WHAM" volleys it into a distant goal.. Like to see Don fucking Revie do that, CLOUGH removes his track suit trousers, rolls his neck. JIMMY GORDON quickly divides the players into two teams, blows the The game starts. CLOUGH, leading by example, anxious to prove himself, is soon darting about, calling out. Here, son. To feet. Keep it simple. Think and give. On the deck. Nice and crisp. Yes, to me, Sniffer. To me. CLARKE passes the ball. But it's a fifty-fifty. Another player bears down on CLOUGH..who refuses to pull out.. "CRUNCH", a bone-shaking tackle from "BITES YER LEGS". Oh, Jeeeeeesussss!!! CLOUGH is flattened. Rolls around on the floor. JIMMY GORDON runs up to NORMAN HUNTER..
JIMMY: Fucking matter with you? He said no HUNTER aggressively steps forward. Nose to nose. He is immediately flanked by other aggressive Leeds PLAYERS. Crowding the referee. Intimidating him.
HUNTER: What are you going to do about it? Book me? JIMMY GORDON backs off, visibly frightened. CLOUGH lies on the floor. In agony. Holding his knee.
BREMNER: ( mimicking ) "Two hundred and fifty-one goals in two hundred and seventy-four starts."
JIMMY: I've got what you were looking for. JIMMY holds up a large parcel wrapped in brown paper. CLOUGH's expression changes.
CLOUGH: What about the petrol?
JIMMY: In the boot of the car.
CLOUGH: Good lad.
CLOUGH: Stand back. CLOUGH's SONS watch as their father violently swings the axe down onto the desk. The sickening sound of splintering wood.
CUSSINS: Everything all right?
CLOUGH: ( sunny, waving with the Fine thank you, Mr. Cussins.
BARBARA: Not now, love - please? "Rrrrriinnngggg". The phone rings. CLOUGH tries to ignore it.

CLOUGH: But it might be important. C'mon, eat your carrots. For your CLOUGH gets up. Walks out of the room..
TAYLOR: You asked me to find a player with a good head. Experience. I've found one! He's perfect. Dave Dave Mackay?!? He's a hundred and fucking fifty.
CLOUGH: Dave Mackay?!? He's a hundred and fucking fifty.
TAYLOR: I admit he's not young.
CLOUGH: Not young? He's old as fucking time!
TAYLOR: But he's clever, keeps the ball well. And passes it better than anyone A voice calls from TAYLOR's dining-room..
TAYLOR: ( looks left and right ) He's the one, Brian.
CLOUGH: You sure?
TAYLOR: Never been more sure of anything in my All right, I'll talk to Longson in the We haven't got until morning. Hearts have already made him an offer. Want him as their manager. Apparently they've already agreed terms.

TAYLOR: We haven't got until morning. Hearts have already made him an offer. Want him as their manager. Apparently they've already agreed terms.
CLOUGH: Well, what did you fucking call me for Because when I asked Bill Nick how done the deal was - he said ninety- nine per cent. CLOUGH's face.
TAYLOR: Because when I asked Bill Nick how done the deal was - he said ninety- nine per cent. CLOUGH's face.
CLOUGH: Meaning he hasn't signed.

BARBARA: Brian..? Love..?
CLOUGH: Where would we play him?
TAYLOR: In the middle of the park. Somewhere he can see everything, use his loaf, and tell the kids what to do.
CLOUGH: We'll play him as a sweeper, then.
TAYLOR: ( eating crisps )
CLOUGH: Won't have to run about too much. And what's all this I hear about a tie He's got a tie shop, hasn't he? In London. Which he spends two days a week at.

TAYLOR: It's his "nest egg". For the future.
CLOUGH: No one's going to be wearing fucking ties in twenty years time. CLOUGH and TAYLOR both giggle. Like kids. The car pulls Hope his footballing brain is better than his business brain.
CLOUGH: You know it's illegal. To sign someone on the sabbath.
TAYLOR: Is it? Then perhaps we should just shake on it today? And sign tomorrow?
CLOUGH: What? And let Hearts in again in the morning? Fuck off. I'm not leaving here without a CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk up the garden path.. You'd bloody DO that, too - wouldn't you? Come all this way, then just "shake hands"? Dear oh dear. What would you DO without me?
TAYLOR: Hey, you would never have FOUND him if it weren't for me. CLOUGH stops, rings the doorbell. Looks at TAYLOR.
CLOUGH: Good job we're both wearing ties.
MACKAY: Who the bloody hell are you?
CLOUGH: My name's Brian Clough, and I once had the pleasure of playing for England against you in an Under-23 match.
MACKAY: I remember you now. You had a black eye, a right bloody shiner. And never stopped fucking talking! What are you doing here?
CLOUGH: Come to talk to you about the Promised Land, Dave. Land of Milk and Honey. It's a little place up the M1 called May we come in?
UNCLE SAM: Dave Mackay??
CLOUGH: You don't look happy, Uncle Sam.
UNCLE SAM: I'm not. What were you thinking? Going over my head like that? Why didn't you Because you'd have said `no'.
CLOUGH: Because you'd have said `no'.
UNCLE SAM: Bloody right I'd have said `no'. The man's bloody crocked.

UNCLE SAM: Is he fuck. He's broken more bones than Evel Knievel.
CLOUGH: Trust me, Mr. Chairman. It's money well spent. LONGSON turns and double-takes..
UNCLE SAM: And who the FUCK are they?
CLOUGH: That'd be Messrs. McGovern and O'Hare.
UNCLE SAM: ( almost passing out ) Where did they come from?
CLOUGH: My old stomping grounds. Hartlepools and Sunderland. Very reasonable, too. CLOUGH smiles.. Just doing what's best for the club.

TAYLOR: Dunno. It was just obvious. McGovern in midfield, Mackay at the back, O'Hare up front. The skewer isn't it? In the shish kebab. CLOUGH watches MACKAY passing the ball, creating space..

CLOUGH: Right, the team for today is: Harvey in goal, Reaney, Cherry, Bremner, McQueen, Hunter, Lorimer, Clarke, Jordan, Giles, Gray. CLOUGH folds a piece of paper. A flicker of vulnerability. Obviously all eyes will be on us to see how things have changed. Without Don. What might be different under me. Let's show them some of the things we've been working on. Our changes in attitude, too. Our new outlook. New discipline. New approach. Let's see some of you playing with a Team talk over: the PLAYERS put on their shoes. Make final The two teams are limbering up in the tunnel.

CLOUGH: But he's right. Five nothing. They made us look like fools today. And what was John O'Hare doing? Letting Madeley bully him like that.
TAYLOR: He was all over the place. Like the Wandering Jew. Giving the ball to anyone BUT his own. We need a ball player, a natural in midfield. Who'll hold onto it. Keep possession. We're giving it away too easily.
CLOUGH: He was all over the place. Like the Wandering Jew. Giving the ball to anyone BUT his own. We need a ball player, a natural in midfield. Who'll hold onto it. Keep possession. We're giving it away too easily.
TAYLOR: Someone like Colin Todd.
CLOUGH: ( sharp intake ) Oooh, now you're talking. Lovely pair of feet.
TAYLOR: I've heard he wants out of Sunderland, too. They're all jumping ship up CLOUGH thinks for a moment, then.
CLOUGH: Well, go on then. Sign him.
TAYLOR: What? We can't. Longson's already told us. Club's in debt.
CLOUGH: Bollocks to that. I've not brought us all the way to the First Division just to sit there mid-table, and be cannon fodder for sides like Leeds. Sign the Hang on, hang on, careful.
TAYLOR: Hang on, hang on, careful.
CLOUGH: I'll handle bloody Longson.
UNCLE SAM: A hundred and seventy grand?!? For Colin fucking Todd?!?
CLOUGH: Correction, the ALMIGHTY Colin Todd. The best technical footballer in the A salary of three hundred quid a week? You can't pay a footballer that!!
UNCLE SAM: A salary of three hundred quid a week? You can't pay a footballer that!!
CLOUGH: That's the way things are going, Uncle Sam. Football's all about money now.
UNCLE SAM: I told you never to go over my head Had no choice. Windows opened up. You were in the bloody West Indies.
CLOUGH: Had no choice. Windows opened up. You were in the bloody West Indies.
UNCLE SAM: WindowS? You mean there were others?!?
CLOUGH: Messrs. Gemmell and Hennessy. Two PLAYERS turn and wave to LONGSON..
UNCLE SAM: ( eyes popping/apoplectic ) For fucks SAKE!
CLOUGH: Let me ask you a question, Uncle Sam. What did you come into football for?
UNCLE SAM: To support the football club in MY HOME TOWN. The club I've supported ALL
CLOUGH: Well, I'm sure we all admire your What I DIDN'T come into it for was to be lectured by a cocky little twat from the North East.
UNCLE SAM: What I DIDN'T come into it for was to be lectured by a cocky little twat from the North East.
CLOUGH: But the way I see it, there's no point being in this game unless you want to beat the best, and be the best, and that's all the people of Derby want. To see their team on top of the tree, Derby, Derby Uber Alles, and if it's really their interest you have at heart, not just impressing your friends in the Director's box, I suggest you keep your eyes on your road haulage business, keep your opinions to yourself and start signing some fucking cheques, there's a good lad. Leave the running of this football club to the professionals.
UNCLE SAM: But professionals DON'T run the club, Brian, the Chairman does. And if it's true, that football is all about money, and that's the way it's going, that's suits us Chairmen just fucking fine..because we're the ones who've got it. SAM LONGSON lights a cigar, and walks off.
CLOUGH: See they've driven all the way into the car park this time.
TAYLOR: It's not a cup game, is it? CLOUGH and TAYLOR look at one another, "Nutter".
CLOUGH: You know what your job is today?
MCGOVERN: Yes, Boss. Stay in position. Keep the shape. "Stop being the Wandering Jew".
CLOUGH: Good lad. And enjoy it. You deserve to. You've worked hard this week. CLOUGH moves to JOHN O'HARE. Clear about what you're doing today?
O'HARE: Be big. Be strong. Any chance I get, flatten Paul fucking Madely.
CLOUGH: Good lad. He bullies you, you bully him back. And near post for the corners we worked on.
O'HARE: Yes, Boss. CLOUGH moves to another PLAYER. ( his new signing, COLIN TODD )
CLOUGH: Understand what I want from you today, I should, Mr. Clough. It's simple Go on, let's hear it.
TODD: ( smiles ) I should, Mr. Clough. It's simple Go on, let's hear it.
CLOUGH: Go on, let's hear it.
TODD: "To be Colin fucking Todd, the best technical footballer in the country." Laughter in the dressing-room.
CLOUGH: There, how could you forget that? Now come on.. Up and at `em! CLOUGH holds the door open, shaking each and every one of the PLAYERS' hands as they clatter out into the tunnel..
CLOUGH: Congratulations, lads! Beautiful! That was as perfect a half of terrible football as I've ever seen. The plan you've obviously been hatching to get me the sack has worked a treat, so you deserve a little celebration. CLOUGH pours brandy into a tea-cup, gives it to a PLAYER.. You do want me to get the sack?
MCGOVERN: No, Boss.
CLOUGH: Then why the fuck did you give it to their most dangerous player, Johnny fucking Giles?
MCGOVERN: I didn't see him. CLOUGH turns to another PLAYER, ( JOHN O'HARE ), pours him a shot of cognac.
CLOUGH: You want me to get the sack, Mr No, Boss.
O'HARE: No, Boss.
CLOUGH: That open goal? Looked like a deliberate fucking miss to me. A miss to get your manager the sack. CLOUGH turns to a third PLAYER, ( COLIN TODD ), hands him a You do want me to get the sack, Mr. No what?
TODD: ( CO NTINU ED )
CLOUGH: No what?
TODD: No, Boss.
CLOUGH: The amount of bloody money I paid for you, I must have been out of my mind. You can't even keep on your feet.
TODD: No, Boss. CLOUGH turns, and faces the room.
CLOUGH: You've all done a terrific job of getting me the sack. So I'm not letting you out of here for the second half, until you've finished the The PLAYERS stare at one another, holding their drinks.
DRINK!!!: The PLAYERS nervously down their drinks. CLOUGH exits..
TAYLOR: You can't do that!! CLOUGH winks.
CLOUGH: Can't I? Just you fucking watch me!! CLOUGH storms off. PETER TAYLOR is left alone. Looks pale. Momentarily holds his chest.
JIMMY: You all right?
TAYLOR: TAYLOR indicates JIMMY's cigarettes.
41A: 68 CON TINUE D: 68
JIMMY: ( to TAYLOR ) Where's he gone now?
RRRRROOOOOAAAAARRRRRRR: The building is almost brought to it's foundations.. CLOUGH looks up. Desperate to know. Derby or Leeds? But it's only 4.35. Game still not over. Not by a long way. CLOUGH carries on pacing. Walks from one side of the room to the next. Left to right. Right to left. Then, another stadium-shaking..
RRRRRROOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR: CLOUGH looks up at the clock. 4.55. This is intolerable. The game must be over now. CLOUGH cannot bear it a moment longer. He opens the door.
CLOUGH: Who scored?
TAYLOR: Who scored?
CLOUGH: Who scored?
TAYLOR: O'Hare. A brace. Oh, Brian, you should have seen his first. Turns Bremner inside out, nutmegs Madeley for good measure. It was beautiful. You'd think he'd been born in Rio de Janeiro, not CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk off down the corridor. What made you go for the Brandy?
CLOUGH: They were just nervous. Shitting themselves. You could tell.
TAYLOR: You're a bloody genius. I tell you what, Bri - if we can beat this lot, we can go all the way.
CLOUGH: Derby County winning the championship is a victory for decency, for honesty and for football. Because they don't pull shirts, or nudge people in the back in the box.
44A: 80 CON TINUE D: 80
REVIE: I haven't personally heard Mr. Clough's comments, but they have been reported to me, and our solicitors are looking into them. If I could offer Mr. Clough some advice .I think he'd be better off keeping his opinions to himself.some of these allegations against Leeds United and his fellow professionals are an absolute CLOUGH appearing on half-a-dozen TV shows. Quick, controversial, charismatic, witty. A natural media star, ( we intercut our actor with the genuine archive footage )
CLOUGH: Don Revie? Ooooh. Don't mention that name to me.
DAVID FROST: It's really like the other House of Commons. You hate to mention him. Why?
CLOUGH: I hate to mention him why? Because he's a very talented man and I don't like him. The audience laughs. He's a very, very talented man and his record is unsurpassable. But I just happen not to like him. And I don't like the way he goes about football either. Football is a game of opinion and there are perhaps people in your profession who don't like the way you do your bit.
DAVID FROST: ( CO NTINU ED )
CLOUGH: And er. it makes the game go round. Half the country don't like a Labour government. It just happens that the other half do.
JOHN SADLER: Brian, you've been called big-headed, arrogant, brash, the lot -
CLOUGH: By your profession, John, yeah.
JOHN SALDER: Sure. And a whole of it right too.
CLOUGH: And a whole lot of it wrong.
JOHN SALDER: Fine. I'll concede that. So how would you define your approach to management, apart from being All laugh.
CLOUGH: ( laughing, rubbing eye ) Good lad. Thank you for the compliment. It's very, very difficult when you get asked a question like
45A: 82 CON TINUE D: ( 3 ) 82
CLOUGH: Suprised, David..but more than surprised, delighted. It's nice isn't it. For the good guys to win for once.
COLEMAN: Which for you was the most important match to win and the best performance from your point of view.
CLOUGH: Beating Leeds United, obviously. Always a particular pleasure that.
COLEMAN: Brian, you've also done it on comparatively small gates, which I know has niggled you a little bit during the season.
CLOUGH: Niggled me, David, it's absolutely made me blazing. To be honest, I know what I want to achieve, I know what the people of Derby want us to achieve, but when you've got a chairman not wanting to put his hand in his pocket. MICHAEL PARKINSON, the highest rating talk show on TV.. You ever see eighty five or perhaps ninety percent of chairmen talking - I'd love a few chairmen on your programme occasionally - I believe the very sight of them brings the game into disrepute ( some clap in the audience ). And every time they open their mouths it kills it. Because the very thing they've given me a lot of stick about over the years - about talking too much and going on television too much, there are the very people who can put two words together and its rather embarrassing to me that a man - or men - can stop me talking to people like you. I love football. It's deep, it goes right down through. It's in every nerve, vein, you name it. It consumes me. And when I have to come and talk about I like the passions of football to come out. Because there are not enough in the game.

TAYLOR: Are you going to stop it?
CLOUGH: No, I want to fight him! They roar with laughter. Cheers and celebration. Everyone roughing up CLOUGH's hair, patting him on the back.
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: William Bremner, your conduct in the Charity Shield match was deplorable and cannot be tolerated.
CLOUGH: It was.
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: We understand Leeds are taking disciplinary action against you internally, however the Football Association has to be seen to make an example. We have therefore decided to impose a fine of five hundred pounds.. CLOUGH's face: a victorious look.
CLOUGH: Thank you..
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: .and a suspension until September "Bang", he brings down a gavel. CLOUGH's face: the smile What? September 30th? That's more than a month? Thats six bloody weeks??
CLOUGH: ( disbelieving laugh ) What? September 30th? That's more than a month? Thats six bloody weeks??
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I'll make it seven if you carry on with language like that..
CLOUGH: C'mon, double the fine. Treble it. Anything. Don't suspend him for that long. He's my Captain. The best player I've got. The COMMITTEE MEMBERS get to their feet and walk out.

CLOUGH: I suppose you've heard!
TAYLOR: God.what time is it?
CLOUGH: Suspended for eleven bloody games!!
TAYLOR: I know. You're buggered. Billy Bremner's the heart and soul of that Plus Mike Jones and Eddie Gray are Like I said. You're buggered.
CLOUGH: Plus Mike Jones and Eddie Gray are Like I said. You're buggered.
TAYLOR: Like I said. You're buggered.
CLOUGH: What do I do, Pete? I need new players. Tell me who to buy.
TAYLOR: No, Brian.
CLOUGH: Help me. C'mon, we'll sort this place out together. You and me. Turn it It's too late. I'd have helped you once. But not now. Not after what was said. We're on our own now. Each man for himself. Remember?

MACKAY: Well, look who it is! Come to raid my larder? Or just missing the place?
CLOUGH: McGovern and O'Hare. I've spoken to them on the phone. They want to come and play for me.
MACKAY: Aye, and you can have `em. A hundred and fifty thousand pound for the pair.
CLOUGH: Cheeky sod! They're not worth a penny more than seventy.
MACKAY: But you're desperate now, aren't you? Having lost to Stoke and Birmingham.. All, right, since it's you..I'll knock ten grand off.
CLOUGH: Give you a hundred grand.
MACKAY: One thirty. Final offer. CLOUGH is about to explode, then..
CLOUGH: All right. Done. The two MEN shake hands. Barely. So? Enjoying yourself?
MACKAY: Two wins from two. What's not to enjoy? You?
CLOUGH: Loving it. Different class, Leeds. Proper club. BIG club.
MACKAY: Demand results there, though, Brian.
CLOUGH: Hey, it's `Boss' to you.
MACKAY: Not any more.
CLOUGH: I bought you when you were crocked, you fat bastard. And gave you the two best years of your career. It will always be `Boss' to you.
MACKAY: Why would I do that?
CLOUGH: Exorcise the bloody place. Get rid of Why? You're not here anymore, are you? Be a waste of a perfectly good desk.
MACKAY: Why? You're not here anymore, are you? Be a waste of a perfectly good desk.
CLOUGH: Fucking Scot.
JIMMY: McGovern and O'Hare? Can't believe he actually sold them to you. It must be true, then..
CLOUGH: The rumour that he's after buying Duncan Mackenzie. It's why he needs the money.
JIMMY: The rumour that he's after buying Duncan Mackenzie. It's why he needs the money.
CLOUGH: Who's Duncan Mackenzie?
CLOUGH: Congratulations, lads!! My first signings for Leeds. My Leeds United. Playing with flair and winning with honour. Winning the `right' way. And winning the admiration of fans all over Europe because.
MCGOVERN: Because of the way we play.
CLOUGH: Because of the way we play!!! MACKENZIE lights a cigarette.. We're going all the way, lads. Inter Milan, Barcelona. We're going to win silverware Don Revie could only dream Yes, Boss.
CLOUGH: And you, Mr. Mackenzie, you scored twenty-eight goals last season. You'll score me twenty-nine goals this.
MACKENZIE: Yes, Mr. Clough.
CLOUGH: Do you know how many goals I scored before I got injured?
MACKENZIE: I'm sorry, Mr. Clough. I don't.
CLOUGH: Two hundred and fifty-one. MCGOVERN and O'HARE privately exchange looks, "Here goes". Do you know how many games it took me?
MACKENZIE: I'm sorry, Mr. Clough, I don't.
CLOUGH: Have a guess. Go on. O'HARE mouths "Two hundred and seventy-four"..
MACKENZIE: Three hundred? MCGOVERN closes his eyes, "Moron."
CLOUGH: Two hundred and seventy-four! Now what do you think about that?
MACKENZIE: Is that a record, Mr. Clough?
CLOUGH: ( rolling eyes ) `Course it's a bloody record. You know what ELSE you lot can do that's even more important? You can be my eyes and ears in that dressing Yes, Mr. Clough/Yes, Boss
CLOUGH: Need to know what they say about me. Who's making trouble. Who the ringleaders are.
MACKENZIE: Yes, Mr. Clough.
CLOUGH: Want you to help me clear this place out. Make it MY team, understand. OUR team. Clean it up and clear it out once and for all.
MACKENZIE: Yes, Mr. Clough. CLOUGH indicates MACKENZIE's drink..
CLOUGH: Now c'mon, drink up. We're off to meet the press.
MACKENZIE: Yes, Mr. Clough. MACKENZIE knocks back his champagne..
CLOUGH: And Duncan..?
MACKENZIE: Yes, Mr. Clough?
CLOUGH: It's "Boss" from now on. There's a good lad.
MACKENZIE: Yes, Mr. Clough. CLOUGH sighs and goes. MCGOVERN and O'HARE roll their eyes. MACKENZIE stubs his cigarette, and hurries after them..
BREMNER: What the hell did you buy them for? Waste of bloody money.
CLOUGH: Duncan Mackenzie scored twenty-eight goals last season. John O'Hare and John McGovern are both internationals.
GILES: We've got two strikers, Alan Clarke and Mick Jones, they're internationals, too.
CLOUGH: And one's injured and the other's fucking suspended.
BREMNER: Maybe if you spent a little more time here on the training ground with us, you wouldn't need to buy Derby We've a game Saturday. Against Queens Park Rangers. Or had you forgotten?
CLOUGH: I haven't forgotten.
GILES: Well, you haven't told us a single thing about how QPR will play. Mr Revie would have files and dossiers prepared. Had the reserves playing the Rangers way all week. Had the first team looking out for this and that.
CLOUGH: Bollocks to Mr. Revie! You're professional footballers. Stop Stan Bowles! That's all you need to know about QPR. And I don't have to justify myself to you. Not how or when I conduct training. Not who I buy or pick to play.
GILES: No. Not to us. But come Saturday afternoon, there'll be 40,000 people here who you DO have to justify yourself, to. GILES, BREMNER et al walk off. CLOUGH left, staring. OVER THIS: a large RRRRROOOAAARRRR. GOAL.
CLOUGH: Sorry, lads. CLOUGH walks round the dressing-room, shaking hands individually, patting PLAYERS on the back. You were robbed out there today. Broad bloody daylight. That was never a CLOUGH's tone is sensitive. Tactful. Considerate.

CLOUGH: Watching it all fall apart. It's Brian They won't play for me. Your boys. Your bastard sons. And never will.

CLOUGH: They won't play for me. Your boys. Your bastard sons. And never will.

REVIE: For God's sake go to sleep. Where's you dignity, man? And don't call here
LONGSON: Get me today's team sheet, will you? He lets the curtain fall..
CLOUGH: What's up, Uncle Sam? Bit below stairs for you here, isn't it? Taken a wrong turn somewhere?
LONGSON: Just seen the team sheet. Hinton, O'Hare, Todd, Mackay. That's our strongest side.
CLOUGH: Of course it's our strongest side. It's Leeds United. Would you prefer I sent out the apprentices?
LONGSON: We're at Juventus mid-week. Semi-final of the European Cup. Biggest night in the club's history!! Couldn't you just A weaker side? Am I hearing right? Is the CHAIRMAN of this football club seriously asking his manager to LOSE?
CLOUGH: A weaker side? Am I hearing right? Is the CHAIRMAN of this football club seriously asking his manager to LOSE?
LONGSON: A weaker side? Am I hearing right? Is the CHAIRMAN of this football club seriously asking his manager to LOSE?
CLOUGH: A weaker side? Am I hearing right? Is the CHAIRMAN of this football club seriously asking his manager to LOSE?
LONGSON: You know what I mean..
CLOUGH: Against their biggest rivals?
LONGSON: The Chairman of this football club is asking his manager to be pragmatic. Manage his resources. Prioritise. We've embarked on a huge program of refurbishment and improvements. New stands. Better floodlights. We need a good run in Europe to pay for it.
CLOUGH: I'm going to pretend I didn't hear a word of this. CLOUGH turns to walk away. LONGSON calls after him..
LONGSON: ( checking watch ) We've still got twenty minutes before kick-off. I'd reconsider if I were you. I wouldn't want my employer to be My employer?
CLOUGH: My employer?
LONGSON: Chairman of Derby County. And Chairman LONG before you ever showed up.
CLOUGH: That's right. You were Chairman of Derby County before I came here. I remember that. When Derby County were at the fucking foot of the Second Division, when nobody had heard of them for twenty years and nobody had heard of Sam bloody Longson ever. Full stop. And that's where you'd still fucking be if it wasn't for me; at the foot of the bloody Second Division, where nobody remembered you and nobody had heard of you. There would BE no Derby County without me, no league title, no Champions of England; not without Brian Clough. A door opens and PETER TAYLOR walks out in time to hear.
LONGSON: I'm going to give you some good advice, Brian Clough.
TAYLOR: What have you done now? CLOUGH doesn't answer, and storms off in the opposite direction. TAYLOR is left alone, visibly anxious.
CLOUGH: You're a bloody disgrace! You should be in the book for that, Cherry! "BEEEP", the referee blows his whistle. REVIE smiles to himself as a Derby PLAYER is carried off on a stretcher. You're an animal. A fucking animal, SAM LONGSON watches from the director's box. He closes his eyes. PETER TAYLOR witnesses this.. "CRUNCH", another brutal tackle, another whistle. Another Derby PLAYER hobbles off the pitch. Blood streaming from a cut to his head.. I'll see you in fucking court, CLOUGH's eyes meet REVIE's eyes along the touchline.
60A: 104 EXT. PITCH - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - ( 1973 ) 104
BREMNER: ( under his breath ) Good luck in Europe..
LONGSON: You fucking idiot. LONGSON turns and walks away. CLOUGH turns to survey the carnage in the dressing-room. Like a battlefield. CLOUGH's eyes meet TAYLOR's.
BARBARA: There's Dad, look! BARBARA and the KIDS watch intently. But JUVENTUS score one goal. Then another. The final whistle. JUVENTUS win 3-1. BARBARA gets to her feet. All right. Bed time! Everyone clean your teeth!
SON: Wait..! Look..! ON TV: CLOUGH is in the tunnel. Speaking to a television
CLOUGH: .it's what happens if you have a Chairman who authorizes a multi- million pound refurbishment of the director's box and hospitality suites before he pays for a proper squad. Suppose it depends on your priorities. Players or prawn sandwiches? I know which I'd prefer. I know which honest, working class Derby supporters would prefer, too.. A commotion breaks out. TV JOURNALISTS ask questions, sensing a great story. CLOUGH continues answering as, beside him, ( unseen by anyone else ). .TAYLOR is white-faced, holding his chest.
MCGOVERN: Billy Bremner, Boss.
CLOUGH: Who else?
MCGOVERN: Norman Hunter.
CLOUGH: Who else?
MCGOVERN: Eddie Gray.
CLOUGH: Who else?
MCGOVERN: Peter Lorimer.
CLOUGH: What are they saying? This falls to MACKENZIE, who knocks back his drink. Trembling hands. Dutch courage.
MACKENZIE: That you're never here. That they're worried about the future. That you're just going to fill the place with more Derby players.
MCGOVERN: And that all thing's considered they were all a lot happier under.
CLOUGH: Under who? MCGOVERN dries. Cannot find the words.. Don Revie?
MCGOVERN: Yes, Boss.
CLOUGH: That he's the boss? The Guvnor? The Capi di Tutti Fucking Capi?
MCGOVERN: Yes, Boss.
O'HARE: And that they miss the bingo.
CLOUGH: The bingo?
MCGOVERN: And the carpet bowls.
CLOUGH: Carpet bloody bowls?
MCGOVERN: It helps them relax before a game. MCGOVERN and O'HARE stare at one another..
O'HARE: That it, Boss? Can we go now? CLOUGH stares, lost in thought: the three PLAYERS go. The door closes. CLOUGH is left alone. Then he gets up, and in a terrifying flash of rage, picks up his glass and throws it against the wall..
CLOUGH: What's all this?
JIMMY: Club cars. Complimentary for the senior payers. Brand new. CLOUGH sees BREMNER, GILES and HUNTER trying out the sports cars. His smile fades. He walks up to the REP from the CAR
CLOUGH: Nice to meet you, pet. Now, you can take your lovely sports cars, and put `em back on your transporter..
REPRESENTATIVE: What are you talking about? These are You'll have complimentary cars when you deserve a compliment. Right now you don't deserve a complimentary bicycle between you. CLOUGH takes the KEYS and gives them to the REPRESENTATIVE.. Complimentary cars when you're not .and when you lot start winning some
BREMNER: What are you talking about? These are You'll have complimentary cars when you deserve a compliment. Right now you don't deserve a complimentary bicycle between you.

CLOUGH: I couldn't stand it for another night.
BARBARA: What? So you drove all the way? What time will you have to get up in the Half five. You smell nice.
CLOUGH: Half five. You smell nice.
BARBARA: Do I?
CLOUGH: Forgotten what a woman smells like.
BARBARA: Not like bloody men. That's for sure.
CLOUGH: You still awake? You should be asleep.
NIGEL: Tell us a joke, Dad?
CLOUGH: A joke? All right. There's this bloke walking about in London, when all of a sudden, the city gets hit by a Russian `A' bomb. Booooooooom. CLOUGH sits down, strokes his son's head.. And all the buildings have fallen down. And all the people are dead. And now this bloke is the only man left in the whole of London. CLOUGH continues stroking his son's hair.. And he suddenly feels very, very lonely because there's no one else to talk to. Nobody else but him. CLOUGH's SON falls asleep. CLOUGH doesn't notice.. So he decides that he's had enough, that he can't bear being this lonely, and so he climbs up to the top of the one building still standing. The Post Office Tower. And then he jumps off. And he's falling down, down and down and down, the sixteenth floor, the fifteenth floor, the fourteenth, and that's when he hears the phone CLOUGH looks down. And gets two unexpected shocks. The first is that his SON is already asleep. The second is, there is a tear running down his own cheek.

CUSSINS: Where you been? I was about to send out a search party.
CLOUGH: Look, Mr. Cussins, I know it's not been the best of starts, but in my defence, there are a couple of things I'd like to say.
CUSSINS: This is Martin Hughes. He runs Mercedes here in the North.
CLOUGH: ( double-takes ) We hear that's what you like to drive. A Mercedes?
CUSSINS: We hear that's what you like to drive. A Mercedes?
CLOUGH: It's..what I used to drive at Derby. Well, we can't have Leeds United being outdone by Derby County, can we? So Martin here is going to take you over to his showroom and get you sorted They begin to walk to the door. CUSSINS puts his arm round
CUSSINS: Well, we can't have Leeds United being outdone by Derby County, can we? So Martin here is going to take you over to his showroom and get you sorted They begin to walk to the door. CUSSINS puts his arm round

BOLTON: Especially not Billy bloody Bremner.
CLOUGH: Is that it, then?
CUSSINS: Why? You look white as a ghost, man. What did you think we'd asked you up here for?

CLOUGH: Would you like to hear my contrite CLOUGH pulls out a letter.. "Due to the complete breakdown in communication with the chairman, Peter Taylor and I find it is impossible to continue our good work for Derby County. We therefore wish to tender our resignations with immediate
TAYLOR: ( horrified )
WHAT??!?: What do you think?
CLOUGH: What do you think?
TAYLOR: I don't want to resign.
CLOUGH: No. Nor do I. Don't worry, they'll never let us. We just won them the championship. But it will strengthen our position and force them to get rid of Longson.
TAYLOR: What? Oh, no, Brian. They'll never do THAT. He's Chairman.
CLOUGH: I can't do it, Pete. I can't work with my hands tied, a Chairman telling me what I can or cannot do.
TAYLOR: You're picking the wrong enemy. The enemy's not Longson. It's Revie. And your obsession with Leeds.
CLOUGH: Don't be daft. We won the league, Pete. We're top dogs in Derby now. And Longson can't stand it. That's the No, it's not. It's YOU. This monster in you. This mad ambition. It comes and goes. Sometimes it's good.a fire, that stirs everything up, and then there's this.this thing that takes you over.and destroys everything that is good in your life. TAYLOR's face.

CLOUGH: What are you doing? You weren't supposed to accept our resignations.
LONGSON: `Shouldn't bloody well offer them, CLOUGH turns to the other DIRECTORS.
CLOUGH: I only did because of HIM! You can't get rid of us. It'd be a disaster for the club. For the whole of Derby.
LONGSON: You can't keep shooting your mouth off the way you have been.or issuing these ultimatums.. The board stare at one another, avoid eye contact.. With great reluctance your resignations have been accepted.
CLOUGH: You can't do this! It's madness!
LONGSON: The decision stands. And don't even think of a settlement. You're getting We're going to create a footballing dynasty here. Derby could be one of the greats alongside United, Liverpool, Leeds.. CLOUGH stands in the middle of the room. Speechless.
CLOUGH: We're going to create a footballing dynasty here. Derby could be one of the greats alongside United, Liverpool, Leeds.. CLOUGH stands in the middle of the room. Speechless.
LONGSON: Car keys on the table and out! CLOUGH stares in disbelief at the other BOARD MEMBERS..
CLOUGH: Does none of you have the guts to stop Now! And don't show your faces here
LONGSON: Now! And don't show your faces here
JIMMY: "To the directors of Derby County Football Club. We, the undersigned players, are unanimous in our support and respect for Mr. Clough and Mr. Taylor and ask that they be reinstated as manager and assistant manager of the club." Cheers and celebrations. CLOUGH is congratulated. Handshakes. Hair ruffled.. "Signed by John O'Hare, Roy MacFarland, Colin Todd, Archie Gemmill, Kevin Hector, Alan Hinton.."
TAYLOR: But not Dave Mackay.
CLOUGH: What? Dave MACKAY?
TAYLOR: It's in the evening paper.
CLOUGH: I signed that fat fuck - saved his professional life. Gave him two more years as a player, as my captain. Dave He wouldn't fucking DARE! CLOUGH sees the paper. "MACKAY TO BE DERBY MANAGER". CLOUGH's face. Devastated.
TAYLOR: Why did you do it? I love this place, Brian. I'm happy here. So are you.
CLOUGH: It's not over yet, Pete. The lawyers are issuing a writ tomorrow. Against Longson. The players are calling a meeting. There's talk of them coming out on strike. There's protest marches scheduled for this week-end.
TAYLOR: Why couldn't you just have kept your mouth shut? We'll never find anywhere like this again. TAYLOR stares. Worried. At that moment, BARBARA sticks her head outside.
BARBARA: ( holding phone ) Mike Bamber on the phone?
CLOUGH: Who's Mike Bamber??
TAYLOR: Manager of Brighton and Hove Albion. Someone who wants to offer us a job.

CUSSINS: Players Lounge, Brian. Ten minutes. CLOUGH opens his mouth, is about to reply, but CUSSINS has turned and walked away.
CUSSINS: This is the worst start to a season Leeds has had in twenty years. Four points from five games? Second from fucking bottom? What's going on? As far as I can I see, there's no relationship, no understanding between players and management. Not a healthy one, anyway. PLAYERS heads low. Avoiding CLOUGH's eyes.
BREMNER: Perhaps if Mr. Clough were to step outside, we would all feel a little more like speaking our minds. CLOUGH can't help smiling..
CLOUGH: ( under his breath ) You bastard.
CUSSINS: All right. If you wouldn't mind, Brian? Just for a minute or two? CLOUGH cannot believe his ears. What?? He gets to his feet.
CLOUGH: As you wish. CLOUGH walks out of the room. DUNCAN MACKENZIE watches. Visibly shocked.
VOICE: What's going on? CLOUGH turns to see JIMMY GORDON..
CLOUGH: The last two words of every story ever written is what's going on. "The fucking end."
CLOUGH: I'm about to go home and work out how much I want in severance pay. Don't worry, I'll make sure your job is I'm not staying here without you. No bloody way.
JIMMY: I'm not staying here without you. No bloody way.
CLOUGH: Then I suggest you go home and do the What me and the lads are trying to say, Mr. Cussins, is that compared to Mr. Revie - he's just not good CLOUGH: a dagger in his heart..
CLOUGH: Come on. CLOUGH turns, leading JIMMY GORDON away, then he stops. Having seen something through a window.. Outside: DON REVIE walks down into the car park and towards his car - cheered and clapped every step of the way by LEEDS

CLOUGH: Brighton and Hove Albion? Have you seen where they are? Bottom of the third division.
TAYLOR: And we can get them out of there. Like that. We did it with Hartlepools. We did it with Derby.
CLOUGH: We cared about Hartlepools and Derby. We're from the North, Pete. What do we care about Brighton? Bloody Southerners. Look where we are. We're almost in France.
TAYLOR: Hey, they've got money, this lot. And ambition. And get a lungful of that air. It'd be good for my health.
CLOUGH: You can't manage a team that's not your own people. Not what you know. Anyway the Protest Movement in Derby is still in full flow. We could still get our jobs back.
TAYLOR: No, we won't. It's over, Brian. They'll never take us back. Not now.
CLOUGH: What about proper clubs? Like Manchester United? Or Spurs? Or England, now Alf's gone. Wouldn't you fancy that?
TAYLOR: No one's rung, have they? You've scared them all off.

TAYLOR: Seven grand? Y'hear that, Brian?
BAMBER: Plus a salary that exceeds by twenty percent what Derby were paying you.
TAYLOR: Very generous, Mike. Terrific.
CLOUGH: But those are first division wages.
BAMBER: First division's where I want this club to be.
CLOUGH: Are you sure you can afford it?
BAMBER: Are you sure you're worth it?
CLOUGH: Cheeky sod. BAMBER offers his hand. CLOUGH stares at it.. We're going to need a holiday first.
BAMBER: Take as long as you like.
CLOUGH: Two weeks. Somewhere hot. On you. BAMBER doesn't even flinch. Smiles..
BAMBER: I'll even throw in the bloody trunks. CLOUGH and BAMBER shake. TAYLOR beams with delight. OVER THIS: we fade in the sound of classical Spanish guitar..

CLOUGH: Who's looking?
ARCHER: My name's Keith Archer. Secretary of Leeds United football club.
CLOUGH: Then what are you doing here, Keith? Because from what I'm reading in my paper, and from what I hear on the jungle drums, you've got a bit of a problem at home with your manager flirting with the England job.
ARCHER: He's not flirting.

TAYLOR: He had faith in us, offered us a job when no one would.
CLOUGH: He offered us a job. And now someone else has offered us a better one..and not just anyone. The best team in the country. C'mon, Pete, you know what that means.. It'd be the Charity Shield at Wembley in a months time. The European Cup after..
TAYLOR: Yes, but even if we won them it would always be Revie's achievements. HIS What? And you'd sooner fester down there? With all those fucking Tories? In that blue-rinse retirement home by the sea?

CLOUGH: And then what? Bottle again as soon as it comes to the big time. That's always been the trouble with you, Pete. No ambition.
TAYLOR: And that's the trouble with you. Too much ambition. Too much greed. Too much everything.

CLOUGH: Plus three and a half grand for Jimmy Gordon. And an agreement that Leeds United will pay both our income taxes for the next three years. The Leeds BOARD MEMBERS choke.
CUSSINS: That's bloody criminal.
CLOUGH: No, what's criminal, Mr. Cussins, is the way you as Chairman asked me to leave the room like that in front of the players. Your MANAGER. Going behind my back like that.
CUSSINS: I admit, that was wrong.

MACKENZIE: Just wanted to say, it's not right. They should have given you more time.
CLOUGH: Good lad.
MACKENZIE: Not just me that feels that way, The sad thing is, it won't work. You can't change a manager like a pair of socks. It'll happen once, to me - and never again. CLOUGH shakes CLARKE's hand. `Rrrrinng', the phone rings. CLOUGH turns and picks up the phone. He listens, then..

FLOOR MANAGER: Five, four, three.. The PRESENTER looks up..

We'll be talking not just to Brian Clough, but also to the man he replaced, who's success he couldn't emulate, Don MITCHELL turns to CLOUGH.. To Brian Clough first of all. What's your reaction to being sacked in this Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction is one of shock at finding myself here with Revie.
CLOUGH: Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction is one of shock at finding myself here with Revie.
REVIE: See? Not so easy to make accusations when it's to someone's face.
CLOUGH: .but in answer to your question, six weeks is hardly a long time to be given a chance in any job. I would hope Revie would get a lot longer time in his.
89A: 144 CON TINUE D: ( 2 ) 144
MITCHELL: Do you consider it was possible to step into your shoes, Don Revie? To replace you?
REVIE: Being very, very honest, I think it was a difficult job for anyone to do. But I do feel Brian Clough, I won't call him Clough because I won't take him down like that..
CLOUGH: Thank you.
REVIE: .I do feel he made it harder for himself than he need have.
CLOUGH: How did I do that, Don?
REVIE: Shooting his mouth off about how dirty my players were.
CLOUGH: Well, you WERE dirty, Don!
REVIE: That's not true. The last four seasons, we've topped the charts for entertaining football.
CLOUGH: And before that, you also topped ALL the disciplinary charts. You should have been docked points and sent DOWN to the second Division.
MITCHELL: And in fact, you went on record and said so, Brian Clough. Again and again. That Leeds should, in fact, be And I was right.
CLOUGH: And I was right.
MITCHELL: Do you think that might have hurt your chances of success when you then came to manage them?
REVIE: Of course it did! The things he said? Why, man? Why did you take the job in the first place?
CLOUGH: Because I thought it was the best job in the country.
REVIE: Of course it was the best job in the I was taking over the League You were. You were taking over the best bunch of players you'd ever seen.

REVIE: There's no way you COULD win it But that's the only hope I've got.
CLOUGH: But that's the only hope I've got.
REVIE: I only lost four matches..
CLOUGH: Well, I can only lose three.
REVIE: No, no, no, no.
CLOUGH: And still play attractive, clean football. Without cheating!
REVIE: See, there he goes again..
MITCHELL: Listening to you, I am struck that this is not just a business matter for you both. It's more than that. It's personal. Am I right?
CLOUGH: Well, we're very different people, Don and I. We have different styles. In football and in life. I'm a warm man. An idealist. I do believe in faeries, and that is my outlook. Don is different. There's a hardness to him. A hardness. Maybe he's not even aware of it. But he's a cold person.
REVIE: You don't KNOW me!
CLOUGH: And that lack of warmth. That coldness was there. Permeated the club when I I totally refute that. The atmosphere at Leeds was like a family. A happy family. You ask any of my players. I signed most of them personally. Knew their backgrounds. Their parents. Their streets. I was a father to them. In that club every morning. Massaging those boys. Did you do that for them?

Their streets. I was a father to them. In that club every morning. Massaging those boys. Did you do that for them?
CLOUGH: They would never have let me.
REVIE: Did you try? You didn't even try. I soaped those boys down with my own hands. You just went to Leeds with no thought for the club, no thought for the players. Just on some kind of mad personal vendetta with me.
CLOUGH: Well are you surprised? What else was I going to do?? After what you did.
REVIE: What did I do?
CLOUGH: C'mon, Don. You know exactly.
REVIE: Never! Matter of principle! I always shake the other manager's hand!
CLOUGH: You shook Peter Taylor's hand, and my trainer, Jimmy Gordon's.
REVIE: Then I probably didn't see you!!
CLOUGH: No, you saw me Don. But considered me beneath you. Looked down on me. And dismissed me. Just like you did every other club and every other manager in the country.
REVIE: Never would I knowingly refuse to shake a colleague's hand. The truth is, I probably just didn't know who you were.
CLOUGH: ( a knowing smile ) "Didn't know who I was!" Pull the other one.
REVIE: It's the truth.
CLOUGH: ( blurts out ) Well, you certainly know it NOW.
REVIE: Oh, we ALL know it now. We know you as the man who's constant outbursts, his defaming of fellow professionals, have brought this game, this beautiful game into disrepute. Who had one of the best jobs in the country, at Derby, and managed to get the sack. Who had one of the best partners in the game, in Peter Taylor, and threw him away. Who was given the greatest gift in British football Leeds United, a team that in ten years hasn't finished outside the top four, and took them to the bottom of the first division. Yes, it's fair to say we all know who you are now. AUSTIN MITCHELL's eyes widen.
MITCHELL: OK, gentlemen, we're going to have to leave it there..
CLOUGH: Well, let's see where we are in a year's time, Donald Revie.
REVIE: Dear oh dear..
CLOUGH: Let's see where we both are in five!
AUSTIN MITCHELL: That's it for tonight's show. I'd like to thank Brian Clough and Don Revie for joining me.
REVIE: Thank you, Austin. The show wraps up. Theme music starts playing. REVIE removes his microphone, turns and walks out. CLOUGH is left staring, hollow-eyed. Wishing the ground would swallow him up..
