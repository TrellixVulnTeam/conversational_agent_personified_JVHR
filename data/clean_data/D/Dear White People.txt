ANCHOR: A "race war" has erupted at one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious institutions.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: How could this happen?
LIONEL: ( knocking ) Kurt! You home?
ANSWERING MACHINE: Hey boyssss, you've reached Lionel Higginsss, the only bitch on campussss who'll give you a dickssscount. That's right hunty, the bigger the dick the less you'll have to pay me to ssssuck it.
LIONEL: Kurt. It's Lionel. I'm locked out.
SAM: Talk to me.
GABE: What would you say if someone started a Dear Black People?
SAM: ( recognizing the voice ) No need. Mass media from Fox News to reality tv on VH1 makes it clear what white people think of us.
HELMUT: You call your Youtube show "Doing Time at an Ivy League?"
COCO: In my second year of a four year sentence. Wanted to go to New York.
HELMUT: Yeah? And do what?
COCO: Things my mama taught me not to. You know get in a lot of trouble and become famous for it. But alas I didn't get into Tisch.
HELMUT: Armstrong / Parker? That your rooming assignment?
COCO: Traditionally it's where the hopelessly Afrocentric gather to process their guilt over not going to an HBCU. Where the Negros be at.
HELMUT: That's not where you want to be?
COCO: Bechet House is more my style.
HELMUT: With the rich white kids.
COCO: Excuse me?
HELMUT: What part of Chicago you from?
COCO: Hyde Park.
HELMUT: What street?
COCO: Seventy Eighth and
HELMUT: Seventy Eighth is Southside sweetheart. And you know what they say. You can take the girl out the hood but
COCO: Ain't nothing hood about me.
HELMUT: Thanks so much for coming in.
COCO: So what's this show about anyway?
HELMUT: Here's the way reality works sweetheart, I'm the producer. I ask the questions. Be in touch.
HELMUT: This is the school radio?
TROY: Someone turn that trash off.
SOPHOMORE: What's up my brother?
TROY: Ya'll take care. Nice Jordan's bro.
SOFIA: Your hair is so cute B. T. Dubs.
COCO: You're so cute.
SOFIA: Is it weaved?
COCO: ( moving on ) Hey what house did you get?
SOFIA: Huh? Oh Bechet bitch.
COCO: Of course. The mere thought of a Fletcher anywhere else.
SOFIA: Easy, it was the luck of the draw. Daddy had nothing to do with it.
COCO: I'm down to switch if you are. You get your Denzel. I get my Gosling.
SOFIA: Oh I got mines. Want to meet him?
COCO: ( off Sofia's jealous .for a Black boy.
SOFIA: Hey boo. This is my friend Coco. She's new to the house.
TROY: Hey I'm Troy. Welcome to Armstrong / Parker, home of the dopest
SOFIA: Are we on duty?
TROY: Head of House is always on duty.
COCO: Nice to meet you. I should get settled. Thanks Sof!
TROY: Think I got time for a quick cut?
SOFIA: You got it cut last week.
TROY: It's a Black thing babe.
SOFIA: Since when is OCD a Black thang?
TROY: Don't say "thang" like that.
SOFIA: Besides you've got a shift at the Politicos booth, then a shift at Orientation, then your advisor
TROY: I'll just wear a hat.
SOFIA: Then a movie maybe? Just us?
TROY: Election night. Babe, come on.
KURT: Sofia smiles at her brother Kurt. Troy covers the sting of his dismissal. They both spot Sam's "Missing: Black culture" flyers.
TROY: Is she kidding with this?
SOFIA: You don't have to run again. Just because it's her doesn't mean
TROY: I can't let Sam and her wannabe Black Panthers take the House. The House needs me. This is who I am.
SOFIA: It's who he wants you to be.
TROY: Oh so you pick up a Psych class you think you Freud or something? Huh?
SOFIA: A Freud reference. Sophisticated.
TROY: ( seducing ) Fine Beck, Jung, Maslow.
REGGIE: Yo Troy I forget. Is your major in shucking or was it jiving?
TROY: My major's in Jive. Minoring in Shuck. You're still majoring in trying to fuck my left overs right?
SOFIA: You need a shower.
TROY: You went from ODB to Trey Songz.
TROY: Artie, you know your success ratio with the ladies went up like thirty percent after I started edging you up dog, come on. You went from ODB to Trey Songz!
REGGIE: That's his platform? Haircuts?
SAM: Oofta is as Oofta does.
COCO: Boycotting hot combs don't make you an expert on "colored people" boo.
TROY: No but seriously, I care about you guys. I care about this house. We had a great year last year and if it ain't broke.
REGGIE: Just pretend like you're in the booth. Just you and the mic.
SAM: Hate this shit.
TROY: You really think you can take this from me?
SAM: Troy we live in a world where there's a Big Momma's House 3. I don't have a chance in hell. Thank
TROY: Yo that's enough of that Sam
SAM: then stand up for his own. Look, I know ya'll ain't voting for me. Ya'll ain't ready and I didn't come here for that. The Black Student Union and I have brought a petition to repeal the Randomization of Housing Act. I plan on bringing it to the President and together we can bring Black back to Manchester. It'll be by the door.
MARTIN: I assume everyone has the app I created by now?
REGGIE: ( aside ) It's a child's app.
MARTIN: Good. Voting may commence.
COCO: So that's what you're looking for?
HELMUT: I'm looking for good TV sister.
COCO: I think I'd be good TV.
HELMUT: You're at a great school, getting a great education. Be good at that.
COCO: I am. And when I graduate early with an Economics degree from Manchester it will be the crowning achievement of my Black middle class parents' ambitions.
HELMUT: Conflict is a commodity in my industry. Sam's got it. Do you?
COCO: So you want me to start a fight.
HELMUT: ( exactly ) I don't want you to do anything you wouldn't otherwise do.
SPEAKER: .bigger the dick the less you'll have to pay me to ssssuck it.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Most everything's locked up, but we'll find another residence to move you to. Third time's a charm. What about Armstrong / Parker?
LIONEL: I don't know.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I might have an opening. Maybe it'd be good to be around.you know.
LIONEL: Dean. The worst thing about high school, and believe me it was a long list, were the Black kids.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Maybe it's in your head. Sure, sometimes our folks can be intolerant around people like you.
LIONEL: I don't believe in labels.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: You like jazz Lionel? Manchester's like jazz you know.
LIONEL: This is a research school.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: And jazz is tension. The interplay of improvised solos all creating one song. Your problem is you've got no instrument. No major, no affiliations, no solo son.
LIONEL: I submit articles to the Independent Observer.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: No one reads the Independent Observer, my point is are you playing swing or bebop?
LIONEL: You're mixing metaphors.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Are you a sax or are you a trumpet?
LIONEL: I hate jazz.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I'll do what I can. Not a word of this in the Observer okay?
LIONEL: What's it matter? No one reads it.
GEORGE: Lionel right?
LIONEL: Grood.Gate.I'm ah..
GEORGE: Fan of your stuff. In the Observer?
LIONEL: No one reads the Observer.
GEORGE: You seen this?
LIONEL: What made you come over here?
GEORGE: My staff? God bless them. They're whiter than Michael Jackson's kids. We're fucked if anyone of them writes this story and I will not let the transfers at the Gazette do it first.
LIONEL: The oldest one has his face.
GEORGE: You're in the Black Student Union. You probably know Sam.
LIONEL: ( aside ) Bugle. Focus. The only paper on campus with a national subscription base and an Advisor from the New York Times? Only so many ways a person can distinguish themselves at a place like this Lionel. You're good. You belong with us.
GEORGE: Bugle. Focus. The only paper on campus with a national subscription base and an Advisor from the New York Times? Only so many ways a person can distinguish themselves at a place like this Lionel. You're good. You belong with us.
TROY: Get it yet?
SAM: Event requests for the year?
TROY: Just this month. They need your approval. Also don't forget to pick your office hours. At least 20 per That's absurd.
SAM: That's absurd.
TROY: You're in charge of a hundred residents now. And they need time to complain to your face. About noise. Leaky pipes. Gluten free options in the cafeteria. Etcetera.
SAM: Troy. I didn't think I was going to And by the way petitioning the President on the Randomization of Housing Act isn't gonna do shit. None of the other houses are Because they all have a legacy of rich and powerful allies on the board who will make sure that "random" works out to their And you think a petition is going to change that?
TROY: And by the way petitioning the President on the Randomization of Housing Act isn't gonna do shit. None of the other houses are Because they all have a legacy of rich and powerful allies on the board who will make sure that "random" works out to their And you think a petition is going to change that?
SAM: Because they all have a legacy of rich and powerful allies on the board who will make sure that "random" works out to their And you think a petition is going to change that?
TROY: And you think a petition is going to change that?
MARTIN: "We wuz robbed." That election was suspect man.
SAM: You call me the minute there's an update. Love you too mom.
CURLS: There is one other sister in my Relativity class, I'll be damned if our professor doesn't call me Laretta every God damn time.
DREADS: We all look the same.
REGGIE: Programming professor gets me and Martin here mixed up constantly.
MARTIN: You should be so lucky.
REGGIE: Cute. You get that at Toys R Us?
SAM: I always forget passwords.
REGGIE: You are begging to get hacked.
SAM: Good thing the one evil techno- genius thinking like that is on my
REGGIE: Winning was a happy accident. We want the reform repealed right?
CURLS: Means to an end, sister.
COCO: The talented tenth always has to bust its ass a little bit harder, but I don't see the benefit in blaming white folks for everything.
CURLS: Who's blaming?
TROY: I don't see the issue. I never had one. Never ran into any lynch mobs.
SAM: Lynch mob is still there. Just re- branded itself.
TROY: As what pray tell?
REGGIE: The Republican party.
SAM: Want to know how this world sees you? Go to a Young Republican's meeting and bring up Welfare.
SUNGMI: Or Immigration.
LIONEL: ( aside ) Or gay equality.
KURT: I agree. Got something to add?
MARTIN: I agree. Got something to add?
KURT: The biggest athletes, movie stars, hell your president is Black.
SUNGMI: You're not serious.
KURT: You guys still got affirmative action, you're set.
REGGIE: This shit.
SAM: What are you doing in here?
KURT: Obama. Leader of the free world got into Harvard on affirmative action. Know who's not president right now? The guy that didn't get in.
SAM: On behalf of the colored folks in the room, let me apologize for all the better qualified white students whose place we're taking up.
KURT: Yeah but what other dining hall gives you chicken and waffles? Dear White People right? Funny stuff. How haven't we staffed you yet?
SAM: On Pastiche? Your uninspired humor We're a lot more than a magazine sweetie. SNL staff is basically half Lampoon, half Pastiche. Just like the network comedies.
KURT: We're a lot more than a magazine sweetie. SNL staff is basically half Lampoon, half Pastiche. Just like the network comedies.
SAM: What gives you Clubhouse kids the right to come to our Dining Hall?
MARTIN: Sam? What are you doing?
SAM: You can't eat here.
TROY: Chill Sam damn. Let the man
KURT: Who are you to put me out?
SAM: ( realizing ) I'm the Head of this house. And I'm doing things my way.
KURT: You got any idea who you're
SAM: Yeah, I know who your daddy is. The same one who's been pushing to break up this House for a decade. What's wrong? Is he scared letting the Negroes gather in groups might start a rebellion on the plantation? You tell him from me.he should be.
KURT: Bad move.
SAM: You too.
LIONEL: Is this your house?
SAM: Is this your house?
COCO: The fuck?
PROFESSOR BODKIN: Okay. Does anyone have any comments for Sam's "Rebirth of a Nation?"
GABE: I dig the "silent movie" thing, but it's a little self-congratulatory. Light on story and frankly thematically dubious.
PROFESSOR BODKIN: Okay. Anybody else?
SAM: SAME PLACE - MOMENTS LATER As students filter out of the class.
PROFESSOR BODKIN: Before you say anything might I remind you that I sat through Birth of A Nation, Gone With The Wind, and Tarantino week without protest.
SAM: Before you say anything might I remind you that I sat through Birth of A Nation, Gone With The Wind, and Tarantino week without protest.
PROFESSOR BODKIN: And might I remind you that I read all fifteen pages of your unsolicited essay on why Gremlins is actually about suburban white fear of Black culture.
SAM: The Gremlins are loud, talk in slang, are addicted to fried chicken and freak out when you get their hair wet.
PRESIDENT BODKIN: My only problem with your movie is that it was late. The silent projects were last semester Sam. You were supposed to have emailed your sound treatment over Summer.
SAM: I've been getting footage.
PROFESSOR BODKIN: This is your senior thesis Sam, where the hell is your head at?
SAM: I've got Radio, BSU, this Head of House thing
PROFESSOR BODKIN: Do you want this? Cause if not, don't waste my time here
SAM: Look this thing might as well be my right hand Professor. I was busy this summer that's all.
PROFESSOR BODKIN: With everything but your major? While your peers are taking internships, making short films.
SAM: My dad. He's sick. Had to go home.
PROFESSOR BODKIN: If you need some time off, take it. But if you want to make it to next
SAM: I do
PROFESSOR BODKIN: Pull it together. This is
SAM: Thematically dubious?
GABE: Well what was that supposed to be about exactly?
SAM: You're thematically dubious!
GABE: You invoke Minstrelsy for shock value, but to what end?
SAM: To invoke the same feeling I get when I turn on the TV and see some so-called reality star shuck and jive for ratings egged on by no doubt white producers. Or the sassy Black secretary with no backstory or character development aside from their skin color.
GABE: So it's a tit for tat?
SAM: You're honestly saying that art can't be reactionary?
GABE: You're reacting to a work made almost a hundred years ago.
SAM: Yes because fear of Black men being involved in the United States Government is a completely antiquated concept. No social relevance whatsoever today.
GABE: Frankly I just think sometimes its better to hold a mirror up to your audience than to drop an ideological piano over their head.
SAM: Frankly I just think works that deal with the African Diaspora through a post-modern lens are outright rejected unless they're handled by a white artist.
GABE: African Diaspora? Really?
SAM: Blackface is alive and well in our culture. Who primarily buys hip hop? Watches Housewives of Atlanta? The same homogenized images of Black people over and over again? White people Gabe.
GABE: Who goes to see Tyler Perry movies?
SAM: We're an underfed community. None of this changes the fact that the vibrancy, the complexity of Black culture has been distilled into commodities and marketing schemes to be bought and sold
GABE: to the detriment of the so called "real thing." Got it.
SAM: I am indistinguishable from the so called "urban" images used to amuse and market to white America.
GABE: And the commodification of culture is uniquely oppressive to Black Sam nods fervently as Gabe grabs and unbuttons her jeans.
SAM: On your knees.
GABE: What? You dream in "Cosby" again?
SAM: My hair was so straight. My sweater so big. I told you about that?
GABE: Hey so.this whole "Head of House" thing. Congrats?
SAM: Yeah, it's.it's.
GABE: Weird, right? Never took you as a student politician.
SAM: Yeah, well.
GABE: Sam? What are we doing?
SAM: 28 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 28
GORDON: Kurt it's three.
MITCH: Y.O.L.O. my nigga!
GORDON: We don't even have our new staff yet. Why are we planning this?
KURT: Everyone wants to be on our staff that's the easy part.
MITCH: We're going to make staff bids on Game Night, and the RSVP's are through the roof for that.
KURT: Yeah but Halloween is our premiere party. The waitlist is already a hundred deep and it's going to take a lot to outdo this summer.
MITCH: Cinco de Mayo was epic.
GORDON: How about the Young Republicans?
KURT: Too close to the Tea-Party.
MITCH: Yo we need an East vs West hip hop party. Get the honeys in here.
GORDON: "The honeys?" You're from Vermont.
KURT: Guys what's the Pastiche motto?
GORDON: "Sharpen thy sword."
MITCH: Our motto is a euphemism for It's a reminder that satire is the weapon of reason. So who on campus is being unreasonable?
GORDON: It's a reminder that satire is the weapon of reason. So who on campus is being unreasonable?
MITCH: Sounds like a reminder of how gay you are.
GORDON: Was that even a reasonable attempt at a quip Mitch?
MITCH: Hey Gordon, say reasonable again.
KURT: The hell does Sam think she is?
MITCH: Like Spike Lee and Oprah had a pissed off baby.
KURT: Could we?
GORDON: Kurt turns his heat towards Lionel - has a bone to pick.
KURT: Hey Lionel. Talked to the Dean
GORDON: Please put that away.
KURT: You got to talk to these people in a language they'll understand.
LIONEL: ( yelling ) Wherever he ships you off to, be sure to pack a sense of humor with you, kay bro?
KURT: ( yelling ) Wherever he ships you off to, be sure to pack a sense of humor with you, kay bro?
SAM: The Tip Test. You hit up Jelly's for a snack. Your waitress mistakes you for someone who looks like you ( Black ) who once ran up a thirty dollar bill and left a dollar tip.
LIONEL: Pastrami sandwich on rye.
SAM: .then proceed to wait no less than forty minutes for your food.
LIONEL: Forty minutes? Man she's lucky I leave her forty cents. You do a good job, maybe you'll see a tip.
SAM: Doris was tripping, but fifteen percent is the least I can do.
LIONEL: Doris was tripping, but fifteen percent is the least I can do.
SAM: Or C.
LIONEL: I reject the stereotype that African American's don't tip. I'm leaving her twenty, no twenty five, just to prove I can!
C?: He turns the book upside down and reads the small print on the bottom of the page. "A ) ONE HUNDRED" "B ) OOFTA" and his answer "C ) NOSE-JOB."
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: Free speech my ass.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Stalin quotes for two hundred?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: You're joking about this?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I'm sorry, was I supposed to take "Free speech my ass" as a legitimate suggestion?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: This is your office's issue Walter. Especially after that episode with Kurt in the dining hall.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Every race issue is my issue.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: It's a student issue. You are the Dean of students aren't you?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: How bad is this deficit of yours?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: Worse. But let me tell you something. If this blows up any further? It's on you Walter. Racism is over in America. And if anyone's still dealing with it, it's the I don't know Mexicans probably.
TROY: President Fletcher.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: Son, call me Herb.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: President Fletcher tells me his son got his ass handed to him.
TROY: Sam's out of line. Kurt's alright.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: But you're supposed to be better than alright. Since when do we lose elections Troy?
TROY: The Housing Act passing without a fight didn't help.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: What have I told you about excuses?
TROY: Pops my course load is full anyway. I'm head of Econ Board, I'm thinking about Pastiche.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Pastiche? On Kurt Fletcher's staff?
TROY: You know to round out the res?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I'll be God damned if twenty years from now you have to end up working for that dumb asses son.
TROY: ( put in his place ) Yes sir.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Fletcher and I graduated a year apart. He barely made it through. I graduated Summa cum Laude. Now look who's President and who's Dean.
TROY: What's the difference?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: A couple hundred grand a year. Understand what I'm saying? Now what happened between you and Sam to make her come after you anyway?
TROY: Sofia. You remember Sofia? Daughter of the President. Psych major. "Has the world ahead of her Troy."
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I don't like your tone boy.
TROY: Sorry sir.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: So you lost the House. On to the school presidency then.
TROY: Someone like me?
MOMENTS LATER: Troy bounds out the bathroom in his undies. Sofia on the couch pretends to have been watching television.
TROY: Babe. Hat or no hat?
SOFIA: I don't have to be.
TROY: What's with all this boo stuff?
SOFIA: .since you fucked me with your big Black cock.
TROY: ( yes ) I love you.
SOFIA: Is it Sam?
TROY: Can we please just, get ready?
SOFIA: Why? I hate my brother's friends.
TROY: You're not going to go with me?
SOFIA: You'd go without me?
TROY: You can hang out while I'm
SOFIA: Okay, what's with you and my brother? Are you in love with him? Is this like, some DL shit?
TROY: "DL shit!?"
GEORGE: I keeps it clean Ya know what I mean. I drinks my Vodka straight, like I'm a fiend.
ANNIE: Wait, quiet I want to hear this.
ANNIE: Ohmigod, this is going on Facebook.
LIONEL: Relax the Negro at the door is not here to rape you.
GEORGE: We're taking a break, what are you doing here?
LIONEL: You wanted me to drop in and tell you how the story was coming?
GEORGE: Yeah like this week. It's Saturday night. You got nowhere else to be?
LIONEL: It was this or the new Madea movie.
GEORGE: Dear God. Where does Madea go this time? Dialysis?
REGGIE: Man fuck Tyler Perry.
SAM: Like, can we have a movie with, you know characters in them? `Stead of stereotypes wrapped in Christian Why is every educated person inherently evil? Why this Nigga gotta be in a mutha fucking dress all the mutha fucking time?
REGGIE: Why is every educated person inherently evil? Why this Nigga gotta be in a mutha fucking dress all the mutha fucking time?
SAM: How come the only Black movies Hollywood wants to make are ones with mammies in fat suits or Black women in pain man?
TEENAGER: Most people are here to see Fang 9. Kelly Rowland's in it?
SAM: How `bout you stop stereotyping yourself and put that shit out? This ain't "Friday."
REGGIE: Yo Sam. We got to talk about the protest. When are we are bringing the Housing fight to the prez?
SUNGMI: The House voted down sponsoring the What do we need it sponsored for?
REGGIE: What do we need it sponsored for?
SAM: Demonstrations can get shut down if a House doesn't sponsor them.
REGGIE: Like the House you're head of?
SUNGMI: Hey Sam, I read "Ebony and Ivy." What's with the Oofta, Nose-Jobs, One Hundred stuff? I miss
SAM: You want me to break it down?
MITCH: Yo my perfect Friday night is whiskey and my T-Bone Walker records, real talk.
TROY: Who the fuck is T-Bone Walker?
SAM: Only a few ways colored folks survive at a place like this.
MITCH: Uh only a pioneer of electric and jump blues bro. Know your roots.
TROY: White folks always be on stuff like decades too late and act like they discovered some shit.
SAM: "Oofta" is the jazz age term for Bojangle types who Blacked it up for White audiences.
MITCH: Don't sleep on T-Bone man.
TROY: Rock, Jazz, Blues - Nigga whatchu got on right now?
MITCH: Public Enemy my Nig
TROY: Yo watch that man.
GORDON: You just called him
TROY: Ya'll get Country Clubs we get to say Nigga.
GORDON: And golf? And all our girls?
TROY: Whatchu mean all your girls?
GORDON: Dude, between OJ, Tiger, Wesley Snipes and uh, Troy over here.
TROY: Yo. It's a word for that.
SAM: An Oofta modulates his Blackness up or down depending on the crowd and what he wants from them.
MITCH: Troy watches this exchange closely.
KURT: Troy watches this exchange closely.
GORDON: Troy watches this exchange closely.
TROY: That's the magazine right?
GORDON: For starters.
MITCH: What other "magazine" you know has a first look deal at NBC? The third biggest Youtube channel. Talk show. Platinum comedy record homie!
GORDON: Couldn't you see him on the talk show Kurt?
KURT: I fold.
SUNGMI: Okay, and a nose-job is a wannabe?
SAM: Sort of. Nose-jobs smooth their Black edges and try to blend.
GORDON: You seen this one?
COCO: Gordon and Mitch turn and notice Coco. Mitch eyes her curves.
GORDON: Not a fan?
MITCH: Sup ma?
COCO: Don't talk like that.
GORDON: Hey I know you.
SAM: A Nose-job's worst fear is that their "Blackness" might cause a fuss or draw undue attention so they apologize for it or use it to self deprecate.
COCO: Forty thousand views already?
GORDON: Looks like someone submitted you to Buzzfeed. Taking off.
MITCH: You wan' a drink a sun'in?
COCO: Let me guess you're from Ohio?
MITCH: What do you have against Dear White
GORDON: What do you have against Dear White
SUNGMI: Okay and One Hundred?
REGGIE: Keeping it One-Hundred! Being Black as hell just cause.
SUNGMI: But what about just being you?
SAM: Like I said.
ANNIE: You don't mind do you?
LIONEL: Of course not.
GEORGE: Alright so then what?
LIONEL: So then Sam says "What, is your daddy scared the Negroes are gonna start a rebellion on the
GEORGE: To Kurt Fletcher!?
LIONEL: Yeah. Yes. Yup.
GEORGE: We've got a news item but there's something bigger here. It's a profile piece on Armstrong / Parker and Sam White's pseudo revolution.
ANNIE: What's the headline?
LIONEL: Outdated nationalist seeks purpose starts race war?
GEORGE: Beers in the corner. Bang out the news item tonight and we'll work on the profile piece for next week.
LIONEL: What are you doing?
ANNIE: All Bugle staffer must freestyle. It's law.
GEORGE: You want to be a staffer right?
LIONEL: ( awkward ) My name is Lionel Kind of like a lion King of the jungle Indigenous to Africa.
TROY: Yo man, you know I wasn't talking about Sof back there with whole forty bitches thing. I was just
KURT: trying to get on my staff?
TROY: I never really thought about
KURT: Bullshit. Game Night is where we make our bids for the new staff. It's why everyone's here. You were practically about to bust out a tap I'm a Poly Sci major man. I just came to hang out.
TROY: I'm a Poly Sci major man. I just came to hang out.
KURT: My staff likes you. A lot.
TROY: But you don't.
KURT: This thing with you and Sof.
TROY: I'm good to her.
KURT: Our dad's have been playing a game of chess off and on since 1972.
TROY: What and Sof is the White queen?
KURT: You're a pawn. And I think it's time you get off the board bro.
COCO: I just think having good hair and carrying on with a degree of sophistication doesn't make me a traitor to the race.
MITCH: Want to know why they used to call me Black Mitch?
KITCHEN: Just as Gordon, Mitch and Coco approach.
TROY: Okay. And what's this year's theme?
KURT: Still working on that.
TROY: The party's a couple weeks away.
GORDON: Yo Kurt. I want you to meet You guys got a party coming up?
COCO: You guys got a party coming up?
SUNGMI: Hey, about the rally. You could still get the permit anyway Sam and go against the board. Most people consider that political suicide We got to rally Sam. Time is now.
REGGIE: We got to rally Sam. Time is now.
SAM: Use your head Reggie. You think a rally is going to change things?
REGGIE: It'll do a hell of a lot more than a radio show or views on Youtube.
SAM: We? I didn't see you running for shit Reggie.
REGGIE: Don't "one word" me.
SAM: Don't "one word" me.
REGGIE: Why you got to snap at me all the time? I'm around you like twenty four seven. Like your lap dog. I don't even usually get down like that with no red bone chicks man.
SAM: Don't call me that.
REGGIE: Come on, I thought your ass was Puerto Rican when I met you.
SAM: I'm taking my ass home.
REGGIE: Come on Sam. You know how I feel about you.
SAM: How am I supposed to know how you feel about me?
REGGIE: You know what? Forgive me if I see something in you. Something inspiring. Something folks like me can get behind.
SAM: I'll set up the rally.
GORDON: Are we sure about this?
KURT: It's ironic. Bold. And don't tell me I'm the only one who thinks Sam White's little movement needs to get cut down to size.
MITCH: `Bout time. It's going to be huge man, fucking epic.
KURT: Boys, we've got a lot more mingling to do. We'll be in touch. And Troy? Get off the board bro.
TROY: Nice seeing you.
COCO: Where's Sofia?
TROY: I have no idea.
COCO: Trouble in paradise?
TROY: What's that supposed to mean?
COCO: It's fine. I'm not even really into Black dudes anyway.
TROY: I'll have you know I'm an equal opportunity employer, okay?
COCO: And what kind of jobs are you hiring for mister?
TROY: Aren't you and Sofia
COCO: I'm an accessory to Sofia. Can't ever shake the feeling I'm an assignment for that Afro Studies Minor of hers.
LIONEL: She seems really cool.
GEORGE: Did we go too far? You're in Armstrong/Parker right?
LIONEL: No. Garmin.
GEORGE: George I'm not exactly down with Sam and I'm not in the BSU. I got kicked out of Armstrong / Parker same as Kurt. But I'm going to write a good story, okay?
LIONEL: George I'm not exactly down with Sam and I'm not in the BSU. I got kicked out of Armstrong / Parker same as Kurt. But I'm going to write a good story, okay?
GEORGE: I hope so. I want a Bugle on your chest by the end of the month.
LIONEL: I'm growing it out.
GEORGE: Night Lionel.
MITCH: Party's not over.
LIONEL: I live here.
MITCH: Sorry bro. Invitation only.
LIONEL: It's two in the morning.
TROY: Coco huh?
COCO: Colandrea doesn't exactly pass the resume test, you know? I mean couldn't you fucking die? My parents should've just named me Ghetto-ass-hoodrat-anisha. Do
TROY: It's ten am.
COCO: Sure about that?
TROY: Sure you don't like Black guys?
COCO: Girl like me is just a placeholder for ya'll at a place like this.
TROY: I'm not like that.
COCO: I don't think Sam would agree.
TROY: That was different.
COCO: No it wasn't. Poor thing, she was light skin-ded and everything.
TROY: Yo, it wasn't like that alright?
COCO: So your upbringing may have actually fucked you up more than mine? That's hot.
TROY: Apparently four hundred years of unreconciled oppression.
COCO: He's not going to like you running with the Pastiche boys is he?
TROY: If I even get tapped.
COCO: You will. And you should do it. They all land somewhere big, some before they even graduate. I've seen you in front of a crowd Troy. I bet you could be famous.
TROY: That what you want? To be famous?
COCO: I want people to know my name.
TROY: Which one?
COCO: ( reading ) We want you. Come by Ellington tomorrow at eight. ( to Troy )
SOFIA: You said you loved me.
TROY: I like you a lot.
SOFIA: What do you do in the bathroom? When you leave the shower running? Was it just to get away from me?
TROY: I smoke weed and write jokes.
TROY: The hell are you doing?
TROY: The hell it is.
LIONEL: The Dean said it was the only Head of House doesn't share.
TROY: Head of House doesn't share.
LIONEL: But you're not Head of House.
DREADS: Stay Black, my brother.
LIONEL: Sure thing?
KURT: Need your submission by Thursday.
TROY: You got it bro.
KURT: The fuck?
TROY: Troy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the humiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall. Lionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the other side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam briefly who shares the same smirk. He realizes Sam's actually looking at Reggie, perched behind him at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him.
REGGIE: Finally made it in.
DREADS: Been moved around a lot right?
CURLS: You must have been terrified when you saw "Armstrong/Parker" written on your moving assignment.
LIONEL: I was just finishing up.
REGGIE: Do Black people scare you?
LIONEL: ( realizing its true ) You're too scared to even ask anyone for a cut.
REGGIE: You're too scared to even ask anyone for a cut.
LIONEL: I'm growing it out.
DREADS: No. I'm growing it out. You're fostering an ecosystem.
REGGIE: How come you don't come to BSU?
LIONEL: I listen to Mumford and Sons and watch Robert Altman movies. You honestly think I'm Black enough for the union?
DREADS: Yo, I love Robert Altman. Mutha fucka goes in.
CURLS: ( after a beat ) We're not all homophobes you know. Black folks?
DREADS: I'm bumping Frank Ocean right now. I don't give a fuck. Imma still eat at Chik Fil A though. Them nuggets good as hell.
LIONEL: I'm late for class.
REGGIE: You're the "Black voice" of the Bugle now. We're just trying to decide if you are friend or foe.
LIONEL: I'm not on staff. Not until I make good on my assignment, I'm just
REGGIE: Assignment? What's the story?
LIONEL: They want me to do a profile piece on Black culture at Manchester.
REGGIE: Of which you are so clearly an
LIONEL: Being neither.
GABE: Sam! Really Sam?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Running late.
SAM: Forget your sign Dean?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Do you honestly think this is in the spirit of Armstrong / Parker The role of the counter culture is to wake up the mainstream to
SAM: The role of the counter culture is to wake up the mainstream to
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I've got furniture older than you. Counter culture? Is that what you think this is? That show of What about my show?
SAM: What about my show?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Your show is racist.
SAM: Black people can't be racist.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Do you read the school papers?
SAM: Is the New York Times a school Your antics are making press Sam and press like this keeps men like President Fletcher up at night.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Your antics are making press Sam and press like this keeps men like President Fletcher up at night.
SAM: Warm milk?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: He's building a file on you.
SAM: It's not my fault your son couldn't beat me in an election.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I'm sure it was hard growing up. Wondering which side you fit into. Feeling like you have to overcompensate perhaps?
SAM: If that's true, I'm not the only one Dean.
REGGIE: There you are! We supposed to start at noon.
SAM: I told you I had class.
REGGIE: Those are going up on Gillespie. Good right?
SAM: No. I mean how long do I have to talk anyway?
REGGIE: You're kidding right? You're sort of the keynote.
SAM: Yeah but.you know I think the whole Malcolm X thing is your lane Reg. I'm just not
REGGIE: They came to hear you Sam. Grab a bullhorn. Turn it on.
GABE: What is all this?
SAM: ( on phone ) Hey. In the middle of Okay. Okay. Okay.
REGGIE: Sam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. Reggie's heart sinks as a bewildered Gabe goes to chase after her.
REGGIE: Yo, what the hell Sam?
GABE: You want me to tell them to go?
SAM: You're so tough.
GABE: I will.
SAM: I want you to wait until they've gone and then head home.
GABE: I'm trying to be here for you.
SAM: Can you be somewhere else for me?
REGGIE: Sam! I know you're home.
GABE: What do you see in him?
SAM: The only eligible single brother on Wow. Okay.
GABE: Wow. Okay.
SAM: I get it. Your parents owned in Harlem or something? You watched "Do The Right Thing" in high school and you want to prove to the world you're down?
GABE: I want to be down? How long does it take to get your hair like that?
SAM: Reggie I will call you later damn! You don't know what you're talking about. Girls like me
GABE: what? Have to pick a side? I'm sick of your tragic Mulatto bullshit Sam!
SAM: You can't say Mulatto.
GABE: Mulatto! Mulatto! Mulatto!
MORE BANGING: Window. Go out the window.
SAM: Window. Go out the window.
GABE: I'm sorry if I can't be your Nubian prince on my Black horse ready to take you back to fucking Zamunda!
SAM: That's not a real African country.
GABE: Can I please get some credit for a solid "Coming to America"
SAM: No? And who am I?
GABE: You're this.girl.
SAM: Who.likes to argue with me about every fucking thing. And I hate it because we both know you're smarter than me. Your favorite director is Bergman, but you tell people its Spike Lee. You love bebop, but you've got a thing for Taylor Swift. I know because my Mac picks up your Mac's library.

SAM: And I was so careful.
GABE: You like to use phrases from the thirties and wear clothes from the fifties and hairstyles from the sixties. You like to watch me when you think I'm sleeping. And trace the outlines of my face.
SAM: Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. It's okay. Get some sleep.
GABE: Everything okay?
SAM: ( happy tears ) His condition's stable.
GABE: Good. That's good Sam.
SAM: Gabe opens the door to the very shocked Bofros and Reggie.
GABE: .and brushes right past them. Sam gets up and stares down the heartbroken looks on her disciples' faces.
SAM: I'm sorry.
HELMUT: New videos are picking up steam.
COCO: Told you I was good TV.
HELMUT: The show I'm scouting for. It's called Black Face / White Place. It's reality. Like a "True Life." Each episode centers on a different one of "us" in a sea of "them."
COCO: Interesting? You think they want interesting? Dignified stories of triumph and survival? They want the "authentic urban experience" which is basically network talk for bitching and weave snatching. I'm telling you this because the network is looking to take one of the subjects to series. I got one episode. One shot to find that subject. So if we do this.

I got one episode. One shot to find that subject. So if we do this.
COCO: .we do it all the way. I'm guessing Sam turned you down.
HELMUT: I think so. She called me a Bojangling Oofta, whatever that means. Everything else she said would've been bleeped on tv. So look, forty thousand hits on Youtube is good. It's not great.
COCO: I'm about to get a whole lot more.
KURT: We don't have anyone like you on staff and you had a great idea. We brought you here to
COCO: I want to MC it. Your party.
KURT: We're here to tell you what we You want me and in order to get me, you have to let me MC.
COCO: You want me and in order to get me, you have to let me MC.
HELMUT: They'd let you do that?
COCO: They got no choice. They need me
COCO: cause without me ya'll look like a bunch of privileged assholes.
KURT: We don't let people video blog our .You got a week to put this thing together boo boo. What's it going to be?
COCO: .You got a week to put this thing together boo boo. What's it going to be?
COCO: You look surprised.
HELMUT: It's just.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Martin, would you share with Troy what you shared with me?
MARTIN: The server that processes the voting results for House Elections has shut down the A.P. database. Saw it this morning. Apparently the intermediary program is on a refractile loop.
TROY: I'm a Poly Sci major man.
MARTIN: Sam currently has 445 votes. That's 200 more than she had last week during the actual election.
TROY: There's not even that many residents in Armstrong / Parker.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: She cheated. Hacked the system.
SAM: I wouldn't even begin to know how to do something like that.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: Is your little war really this
MARTIN: Had to have been Reggie. Dude's in my programing class. Good. Just forgot to turn his program off.
TROY: You're the rightful Head of House.
MARTIN: You're the rightful Head of House.
TROY: ( shit ) So great.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Martin, let me talk to Troy for a bit. I appreciate this.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: Your advisor tells me you're hanging on by a thread in you major. Perhaps it's time to You're trying to frighten me, but I think you're the one who's scared.
SAM: You're trying to frighten me, but I think you're the one who's scared.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: And I think you long for the days where Blacks were hanging from trees and denied actual rights. Then you'd actually have something to fight against.
SAM: You damn right it is.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: We don't have an intolerance problem here. Except for the one I'm looking at.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: You didn't tell me you and Sofia had a misunderstanding.
TROY: Who did?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Her father. She was very upset. Troy. What sort of vision do you have for yourself?
TROY: Get my degree. Then Law School and And what's that got to do with partying with Kurt? With smoking weed and writing jokes?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: And what's that got to do with partying with Kurt? With smoking weed and writing jokes?
TROY: ( wanting it to be true ) Dad no. I want what we always talked about. Maybe have my own firm someday? Run for office. Make a difference. Wife. Kids. I want all that. I really really do.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: And the drugs? God damn it Troy I taught you better than this. I have been in academia a long time, I've seen a lot of things. The men who really run this world? You got no idea what they see when they see you. You are not going to be what they all think you are. You will not give them that satisfaction, you hear me?
TROY: Yes sir.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: I know about the party. You picked a hell of a time.
KURT: What party
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: You're cancelling Kurt. End of Lionel's story on the would-be protest outside of Gillespie is running tomorrow and I'm also having Lionel work on a profile piece of Armstrong/Parker like you suggested. Really break down what's going on.
ANNIE: That was our Times advisor. He said it's stories like these that get editors recommendation letters.
GEORGE: That was our Times advisor. He said it's stories like these that get editors recommendation letters.
LIONEL: The Negro at the door didn't scare you this time.
ANNIE: Lionel please. You're only technically Black. G, going to French. You want me to hold your
GEORGE: Annie smiles and walks out.
LIONEL: You need something? Saw your e- Yeah, I need someone to do the Donor's function on Saturday. Small dinner for the school's big givers. Administration wants a little That's Halloween night.
GEORGE: Yeah, I need someone to do the Donor's function on Saturday. Small dinner for the school's big givers. Administration wants a little That's Halloween night.
LIONEL: That's Halloween night.
GEORGE: Right, which is why no one else will take it.
LIONEL: Ah. Thus the new guy. On my way to class, but you can stay and check out last year's piece. You'll do fine.
GEORGE: On my way to class, but you can stay and check out last year's piece. You'll do fine.
LIONEL: I don't know. Are there going to be any racially fueled outbursts at this thing?
GEORGE: Never know right?
LIONEL: Am I a good writer?
GEORGE: You'll get better. And we need you right now.
LIONEL: You're just a big recommendation away from landing the Times.
GEORGE: God I hope so.
LIONEL: Yeah. Sounds good.
PASTICHE": Troy nervously clicks it open. As he reads.
LIONEL: Funny seeing you here.
TROY: Father likes to show me off at all the Donor functions. The dessert course is usually my cue to take a breather while they talk shop. The trick is to dazzle them into forking over their estates just before they kick the bucket.
LIONEL: So.Picard or Kirk?
TROY: Kirk. Wait.
LIONEL: I saw you watching Star
TROY: Yo what happens in the crib stays in the crib. Not trying to get my card revoked.
LIONEL: Hey, some could argue that a show with Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn and Kunta Kinte himself is a pretty Black show.
TROY: Yeah? That work out for you?
LIONEL: No. No it did not. At least not in High School. I bet there's a statue of you at your High School.
TROY: I was beloved. Won't lie.
LIONEL: Did they know you were a trekker?
TROY: My pops left a paint by numbers template for success at that High School. All I had to do was fill in the blanks. Football captain. Valedictorian. Prom King.
LIONEL: I think it's gaining sentience.
TROY: It's.out there.
LIONEL: It's like a black hole for white people's fingers. They're obsessed.
TROY: You know I cut hair. Why didn't you ask me?
LIONEL: You're I dunno.you?
GEORGE: Li! You ready man?
LIONEL: No costumes? I got a tux for this.
ANNIE: We just got out of the staff room.
GEORGE: Yeah, we're going as overworked.
LIONEL: Where is it?
ANNIE: Garmin House. On third I think?
LIONEL: Third and Basin. I know it.
TROY: Yo man. If I'd gone to your High School, I'd have had your back.
TROY: .my own firm. Maybe run for office. Make a difference you know?
LIONEL: This is kind of fucked up. Right?
GEORGE: Pastiche. The world's most erudite boneheads. Who wants another round? Come on Lionel, help a brother out.
LIONEL: Kitchen's this way.
COCO: Hey there muffins. How do I look? Why are white folks so obsessed with being Black? And why are Black folks so addicted to Blonde Barbie doll weaves? Honeys it's a strange symbiosis we're here to explore.
LIONEL: It's okay. Can't wait to cut all this off.
GEORGE: It's okay. Can't wait to cut all this off.
LIONEL: It's okay. Can't wait to cut all this off.
GEORGE: Don't you dare.
LIONEL: I'll be right back.
KURT: What the hell?
DINING HALL: For a genius dude you're a fucking
SAM: For a genius dude you're a fucking
REGGIE: I did it, we did it for you.
SAM: I didn't ask for it Reggie. I look like I betrayed this house.
REGGIE: Yeah? Well you betrayed me.
LIONEL: Sam? Can we talk?
ANNIE: Hey who am I? "Bitch it's weave. Noun. Present tense ho!"
KURT: Kurt, it's me. I can't do this.
INTERCUT: Kurt, it's me. I can't do this.
COCO: Kurt, it's me. I can't do this.
KURT: Okay, I'm fucking confused.
SAM: What do you want me to do? Go over there and yell at them?
LIONEL: Have you heard you yelling?
SAM: This house is filled with folks willing to take up after a cause Lionel. Believe me. Never would have guessed you'd be one of them For the first time in my life, I can't just sit around and do nothing. How can you?
LIONEL: For the first time in my life, I can't just sit around and do nothing. How can you?
SAM: If I'm caught being a part of anything like this.it wouldn't be good for me right now okay?
LIONEL: Hey. How's it going. Hi.
SUNGMI: Black Student Union.
DREADS: Your call then man.
REGGIE: ( to everyone ) Alright ya'll - thanks for coming out tonight. Looks like Sam's not making it so.let's just call it.
LIONEL: Uh. Excuse me. Hi. I'm Lionel. Some of you.none of you probably know me. I've never been to a meeting. But I just came back from a party on campus and I think you should know about it.
REGGIE: Alright brother. What's the plan?
LIONEL: We go over there. Now.
CURLS: Think there's enough of us?
SUNGMI: You know you don't have a monopoly on being a pissed off minority. Latino's United is meeting across the hall. Asian American League You guys got better snacks.
TROY: DEAN FAIRBANKS
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Not now Troy.
TROY: It's important. There's something happening on campus. I might've.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: You're being rude son.
TROY: Oh am I? How about I tell your precious donors and anyone here who'll listen about the kind of a school it is they're giving to?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I don't know who you think you are young man but you don't get to talk to your father any kind of way.
TROY: All I say to you is yes sir and no sir! Look I should've brought this up before but listen to me!
KURT: Yeah dude. We all got it. I mean, everything's cool right?
GORDON: Yeah dude. We all got it. I mean, everything's cool right?
KURT: Kurt yanks the booze from Lionel and shoves him.
LIONEL: We're putting an end to this Kurt.
KURT: Fuck you I'm calling the cops.
MARTIN: Half of this crowd is under 21.
MITCH: Gimme that mic Before I slap ya Looking for some dykes, that wanna another chapta. If you do me slow, you can do me faster, I'll pass you to the Nigga on my right, he gets you after.
LIONEL: Why don't you tuck your tail between your legs, run and tell the Dean and get the fuck out.
KURT: Why don't you tuck your tail between your legs, run and tell the Dean and get the fuck out.
LIONEL: Heyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo!
COCO: What? Say it. Come on.
KURT: Dude. I know you can't help it.
LIONEL: Finally got me where you want me.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: What is all this?
KURT: I didn't do this. Sam. I had nothing to do with this.
ANCHOR: What some are calling a "race war" has erupted at one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious
DEAN FAIRBANKS: We don't condone this egregious event and are investigating its origins. The president and I are looking at ways to address issues of Diversity at Manchester.
REGGIE: HOUSING REFORM!
HOUSING REFORM!: Applause breaks out amongst the crowd. But so do boos.
MITCH: I'm sorry but it's bullshit. Yo this is how we get down. If you can't take a joke in this day and age? The fact we can joke about it proves we've moved on you feel me? This is an attack on free speech! We're the victims here!
LIONEL: It's hard enough for us to even get into a school like this. Let alone succeed. Find our way. This is only a debate because of who Kurt's dad is, which just proves the point. All you did was have a radio show and look what happened to you.
COCO: I know this may come as a shock, but nobody gives a fuck about no Harriet muthafuckin Tubman.they wanna be us. So they got to be for a night.
TROY: Of course I got my dad involved. It was the right thing to do. I didn't mean for all this to happen. All the posters and everything.
TROY: I think.I'd make more than few people happy if I ran.
SAM: Dear White People.
SAM: .Know what? Nevermind.
KURT: Once I heard what the group was planning, I sent out an email to the staff to cancel it. You have the email printed in front of you.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Who's this?
KURT: My lawyer.
COCO: So when I got the invite and saw everyone clicking "yes" I figured it was back on.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: You were hoping to make the staff?
COCO: CUT TO:
DEAN FAIRBANKS: At what point in time did you show up to the event?
SAM: Why am I even here?
KURT: the time.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: We know you were planning this.
KURT: Your son tell you that?
94D: DEAN FAIRBANKS ( reading ) ( and then )
DEAN FAIRBANKS: ( reading ) ".wishing you could sip on Henny out yo crunk cup without a Bitch giving you the side-eye?" ( and then ) You write this Troy?
TROY: No. Mine wasn't chosen.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: But you wanted to be?
TROY: What I wanted didn't matter then. Why should it matter now? I told you about the party, remember?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Facebook account.
KURT: I loathe Facebook.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: You've used that line on me before this year Mr. Fletcher. When a homophobic message mysteriously appeared on a voice mail line you shared with a roommate.
LIONEL: To stop it.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: By any means necessary?
LIONEL: Someone once told me.Manchester is like jazz. I don't know much about jazz. But from what I can tell, when your solo's up, you better blow.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Well what's interesting is how easy it was to access the group before the note was sent. The password was "Pa$tiche" spelled with a dollar sign according to Kurt. Seems recently it's been changed.
SAM: As much as you hate him, you will stop at nothing to protect your master and his boy.
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Did you send out the invite Sam?
SAM: That invite, whoever sent it should've been met with derision and outrage. Instead, a hundred people showed up and they pulled out posters and decorations and costumes they'd made for just such an occasion.
EXPULSIONS MADE": Next to it is another stack of papers from the INDEPENDENT OBSERVER. The headline reads: "EBONY & IVY: CAN THERE BE
LIONEL: 2 Chainz? Shaft? While endless complex depictions of whites, white men in particular exist - there aren't that many versions of us in the culture.
TROY: Next James Baldwin up in here. Wait hold on a sec.
GABE: Hello Sam.
SAM: Yeah. Prez made an executive withdrawal. Armstrong stays Black.
GABE: ( with a shrug ) Getting too dramatic man. Thinking about getting an apartment off campus. We'll see.
SAM: ( with a shrug ) Getting too dramatic man. Thinking about getting an apartment off campus. We'll see.
GABE: Sam going against the grain? Shocked. How's papa White?
SAM: He's recovering.
GABE: Good. Well.
SAM: We were actually on the phone last night for hours. First time we talked since the bypass. He was putting up a strong front. Teasing me about being so worried. Then came the stories about me as a little girl I'd heard a thousand times. About how independent I was.
GABE: Want to talk about it?
SAM: My mother worked nights so he would take me to school. And it pissed me off because he would follow me all the way to homeroom. Every time he tried to hold my hand I'd scream and pull away. He thought I was just being.difficult.
GABE: I'm sure he forgives you.
SAM: Think so?
GABE: Sam. Where are you going?
SAM: I don't know. Lunch?
GABE: Isn't it Mac and Cheese day at Think they'll let you in?
SAM: Think they'll let you in?
HELMUT: Two hundred thousand views. Look they even auto-tuned it.
HELMUT: Couple months, that's how long shooting for an episode takes. We recommend you cut your course load in half to accommodate the Trust me it it'll read "full-time" in the episode. If.once we go to series, we might have to figure out a summer schedule.
COCO: Trust me it it'll read "full-time" in the episode. If.once we go to series, we might have to figure out a summer schedule.
HELMUT: Trust me it it'll read "full-time" in the episode. If.once we go to series, we might have to figure out a summer schedule.
COCO: For shooting?
HELMUT: For uh.classes and stuff. Won't be graduating early anymore
COCO: Made some new friends?
TROY: Come on Coco.
COCO: Fuck you.
TROY: My dad saw your videos. He's a little worried about
COCO: how it'll look. With your campaign and all. What's your best friend Reggie think?
TROY: We had fun, alright?
COCO: I get everyone else wants you to win Troy. But do you?
SAM: Hey Lionel. With me out and Troy moving on - A/P's going to need a new head of house.
LIONEL: Think there's a story there? Who do you think it'll be?
SUNGMI: Everyone loves you. Won't be hard to rally the vote.
SAM: Yeah. We got you man.
HELMUT: Let me get this straight. First you tried to break up the Black house. Then you took down the sister with the little radio show. And after all that, your kid throws a Blackface party?
FLETCHER: Now wait a minute!
HELMUT: You thought you were having money problems before? Wait till cable gets their hands on this story. Bill Maher is gon' fuck you up!
FLETCHER: I have heard enough
HELMUT: Wait I'm sorry. Look from where I'm sitting this place is a For one we got to show the events that led up to the party
DEAN FAIRBANKS: For one we got to show the events that led up to the party
HELMUT: For one we got to show the events that led up to the party
DEAN FAIRBANKS: That already happened.
HELMUT: Well yeah, but we can reenact
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Documentary term.Look, I can start putting together an overall deal today. I'm talking real money! Turns out the one thing America likes in it's reality more than ignant Black folks, is crazy racist White people!
HELMUT: Documentary term.Look, I can start putting together an overall deal today. I'm talking real money! Turns out the one thing America likes in it's reality more than ignant Black folks, is crazy racist White people!
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Now you look here. This is an honorable institution. The idea that we would so much as entertain this suggestion
FLETCHER: How much we talking?
