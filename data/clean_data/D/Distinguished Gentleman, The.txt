THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN: written by Marty Kaplan
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.): This'll never work, Tommy.
TOMMY (O.S.): Be positive, Armando. Course it will.
TOMMY (O.S.): Look.   See what a lucky fuck I am?
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.): He don't mean the ring, hon, he means the whole plan.
TOMMY (O.S.): So do I.
TOMMY: That's a vodka tonic, a Pellegrino, lime and no ice, a gin Gibson straight up with ex-tra onions -- I am also fond of de onions -- and a Chardonnary spritzer...also with extra onions -- no, no, do not worry, that is just a little joke. There will be no onions whatsoever in your spritzer!
GUEST: You don't need to write it down?
LORETTA: (Eurotrash accent) I'm not too late, am I, dear? (extending a hand) Hello, darling, Alma Preston, how are you today?
DEBBIE: Thanks for coming, Ms. Preston, I'm Debbie Bartle. (consulting a list) Do we have your check yet?
LORETTA: No, honey, I don't think you do, we just got in last night from our place in Barbados -- how much is it?
DEBBIE: Five hundred a person.   Barbados?
LORETTA: (writing) Yes, we're just down the beach from Mick Jagger and Jerry. (looking up) You wouldn't turn down a couple of thousand, would you?
DEBBIE: Um, that's a lovely ring.
DEBBIE: Johnson for Congress. It's not gaudy, it's just...nice and big.
LORETTA: That's my Carlos...I can't even look in a store window. We're walking down this street in Rio, we pass a jewelry store...I didn't even turn my head and he's in the shop... (holds up ring) ...$250,000. I said it's crazy... but you know Carlos.
DEBBIE: I wish I did.
MRS. BRIDGES: I hear they had him open for six hours.
ZEKE: (chuckling) The sum' bitch looks terrific.
ZEKE: How about taking our orders, son?
TOMMY: Absolutely my friend!    How can I pleasure you?
ZEKE: Bourbon straight up and a Perrier rocks for the lady.
ZEKE: Sure, why not.
LORETTA: You know where the powder room is, hon? I should freshen my face before I go in.
DEBBIE: It's just over there.
JOHNSON: So how the heck are you, Olaf?
ANDERSEN: I should be asking how you are, congressman.
JOHNSON: This old ticker never felt better.
ANDERSEN: It's good to see you back on your feet, Jeff. We need you in Washington.
VERA JOHNSON: How's that granddaughter of yours, Olaf? Ready for the Olympics?
ANDERSEN: She'll be thrilled you asked after her.
DEBBIE: What's the matter?
LORETTA: (hyperventilating) My --   my ring. My diamond. I took it off   in the ladies' room to wash my hands.    I was just putting it on -- I must   have dropped it.
DEBBIE: (getting down) Let me help you, we'll find it.
LORETTA: Call Security!
ZEKE: Hey, what about our drinks?
ZEKE: What?    You already took our order.
TOMMY: That wasn't me! You must be thinking of Jamal. I'm Karim. What you want?
ZEKE: Bourbon straight up and a Perrier rocks.
TOMMY: (snorts derisively) Hunh.
JOHNSON: Do you know my AA? Zeke Bridges, this is Jennifer, my Administrative Assistant. Zeke's been a tremendous help to us. I'd like you to listen to his view on health insurance.
JENNIFER: I'd be very happy to.
ZEKE: At Pyramid Insurance, we call our approach the Patient's Bill of Rights.
BRUNO: Ms. Preston?   Bruno Handler, hotel security.
LORETTA: My ring!   My ring! Oh my god...!
BRUNO: Now just calm down, Ma'am... can you describe the ring?
LORETTA: It's a diamond ring! A big diamond ring! Oh my Christ!
DEBBIE: I saw it. It's huge... it must be like eight carats. She says it was a quarter of a million dollars!
LORETTA: Of course it's insured! But you know how it works -- if I report it, they'll cancel me. And I don't want another ring! I need this ring! The ring Carlos gave me.
BRUNO: Where the fuck is housekeeping? I called for those dickheads ninety seconds ago.
ANDERSEN: Now I won't run through Jeff's record -- he's been in Congress twenty years, and I've only got two minutes. I'll just say this: When those of us in pharmaceuticals, or agribusiness, or insurance, or (indicating himself) utilities, or you name it -- when we've needed him, Jeff's been there for us. And we've been there for Jeff, too -- we raised a hundred thousand dollars today!
(APPLAUSE): Without further ado, our man in Washington, Jefferson Davis Johnson.
DEBBIE: I should be in there. Good luck, Ms. Preston. I hope you find it.
LORETTA: I can't go in there like this. God! Please... listen... I'll pay a ten thousand dollar reward for anybody who finds my ring. Just don't tell Carlos! (suddenly grim) He'll kill me.
QUESTIONER: What do you make of all this campaign reform business, Jeff?
JOHNSON: Well, y'know Ernie... these days, everyone's down on the political action committees and so-called special interests. But, heck, I think you and Fran have a right to participate in our democracy in exactly the way you're doing today. I'm in Congress to represent you. I don't want any so-called reform to take that power away from you.
BRUNO: I want every heating grate opened and inspected. I want every air conditioning duct vacuumed. Do you understand what I'm saying?
BRUNO: (running after him) Hey, you! Waiter! Hold it right there!
BRUNO: Calm down.   What've you got in your pocket?
TOMMY: I told the CIA everything! I agreed to poison the pineapples! My green card is in the mail!
TOMMY: Nothing.
BRUNO: I'm warning you, flathead, get cute with me and I will tear you a second asshole. Now a valuable diamond ring is mising...
TOMMY: Valuable?
BRUNO: Very valuable. All right, I'll give you a hunnert bucks for it.
TOMMY: A hundred and five?
TOMMY: No! It's a trick! You will call me a thief and send me back and the Security Police will make me stand on my head in the guano pit! I have seen such things on
BRUNO: Jesus, I'm not trying to trick you...
TOMMY: No, no... it is a trap! I must turn this over to police.
TOMMY: How big is this... reward?
BRUNO: Um, five hundred dollars.
TOMMY: You said 'thousands.'
BRUNO: Yeah.     Right.    A thousand dollars.
TOMMY: No, no, no...you said thousands. With an 'S'. This is plural. This means "two or more thousands."
BRUNO: (deep sigh) Okay, you win. Two thousand.
TOMMY: Or more.     Two or more.
TOMMY: Just making a point.
ARMANDO: Hello?
BRUNO: Hello, may I speak with Ms. Preston?
BRUNO: (smiling to himself) No, thanks, I'll call back.
BRUNO: Now get back to work!
BRUNO: This is Bruno in Security. Put me through to 502 -- there must be something wrong with the line, I can't get an answer... What do you mean, there's no one in 502? I just spoke to them!... No one's registered in 502? Are you sure?... Well, check again!... Shit!
ZEKE: Hey!   Where the hell are our drinks.
TOMMY: I remember... you were the sloe gin fizz and the mango daquiri? With perhaps a small umbrella for the lady?
ZEKE: Bourbon neat and a Perrier, dammit!
TOMMY: And would you still be wanting the umbrella then?
JOHNSON: Olaf, there's something I wanted to sound you out on. As a special friend.
ANDERSEN: Shoot.
JOHNSON: I'm thinking of retiring from Congress.
ANDERSEN: You're what?
JOHNSON: I'm thinking maybe I won't run. Maybe I should listen more (indicating his heart) to this. Really appreciate these years. Sail around the world. Climb mountains. Enjoy the finer things of life.
ANDERSEN: Jeff. Listen to me. You can't retire. Florida needs you. I need you. I need you on rates. I need you on regulations. I need you on those environmental nutcases --
JOHNSON: Olaf, if I retire this year, I get to keep all the money left over in my campaign treasury. Comes to a very tidy nest-egg.
ANDERSEN: How tidy?
ANDERSEN: Come on, Jeff. Look at what you'd be giving up. Going to the best resorts in the world and calling it "official business." Golfing and skiing and fishing, and never picking up a tab. And, Jeff -- there's no aphrodisiac like power. You can have some of the most intelligent, attractive women in the country. You've got it made!
JOHNSON: Oh, I suppose that one-point-three may seem like spare change to the head of Gulf Coast Power, but to a country boy like me --
ANDERSEN: Okay, Jeff. I get it. Look. There's a little software company that's about to go through the roof.
ANDERSEN: A few thousand worth of stock options would stand to make you quite a pile. As long as your blind trust buys them, you're clean -- the SEC can't shake a stick at you. Half a million, easy -- and that's just a start.
JOHNSON: Well, if you put it like that... I now see I have a duty to continue my career in public service.
TOMMY: I'm in the wrong business.
LORETTA: You took your time.
ARMANDO: Cops bust you, Tommy?
TOMMY: Busted?   Moi?    Fuck no.
TOMMY: That look like busted?
JOHNSON (O.S.): Oh my God.     Oh my God. Oh my...
JOHNSON (O.S.): ... God.
DODGE: It was my honor to serve in Congress with Jeff Johnson for a generation. No one could have been a better legislator. No one could have been a finer husband and father. And now --
DODGE: And now God has called his servant home.
DODGE (O.S.): We will miss him. But we are grateful that his passing was so peaceful -- and so like him -- working late into the night at his desk, the consummate public servant.
DODGE: Vera, I know you're still in shock from Jeff's... passing. But we have to talk about his seat.
JENNIFER: Mrs. Johnson, if you'd like to discuss this in private --
VERA: You can stay -- what's the difference?
DODGE: Vera, I'd like you to announce that you're going to run for Congress. Let a few days pass to show proper respect. But next week, I want to stand next to you at a press conference where you declare for Jeff's seat in the House.
VERA JOHNSON: No, Dick -- no.
DODGE: There's nothing to be afraid of, Vera. With your name, you can't lose. People around these parts are so used to voting for Jeff Johnson -- why, Mrs. Jeff Johnson would win in a walk.
VERA JOHNSON: Dick, I was a Washington wife for twenty years. Twenty years of Potomac bullshit is plenty for one lifetime.
DODGE: Vera, we're talking about becoming a Member of Congress. We're talking about a sure thing.
VERA JOHNSON: I'm sure you would, dear. But I couldn't give you the same job satisfaction Jeff gave you.
GRANDMA: This is very sweet of you, darling. But you shouldn't have done it. Where did you get the money?
TOMMY: You don't want to know.
GRANDMA: How did I end up with a thief for a grandson?
TOMMY: Grandma -- I told you.    I'm not a thief. I'm a con man.     An artist.
GRANDMA: But also a crook.
GRANDMA: Sometimes I just wish you were more like your Daddy...
TOMMY: You mean, dead?
GRANDMA: No, smartmouth... I mean someone who made something of himself.
LORETTA: (pointing at TV) LOOK...it's the ad!
LORETTA (V.O.): (fake Swedish accent) I am Inga. I'm here from Sweden and I'm s-o-o lonely. I need a man...and so do my girlfriends.
LORETTA (AND V.O.): ...Maria, my hotblooded Spanish friend...Babette, the Parisian pussycat...and many others. So call the "Girls of Many Nations," at 1-900-555-NATO.
GRANDMA: Compared to what? Loretta, why don't you go baste the turkey?
TOMMY: (calls to Loretta) See?      I told you TV advertising works.
TOMMY: Hello...you have reached Girls of Many Nations. For Hot Blooded Italian Wildcats, press "one" now. (nothing) For Perky American Cheerleaders, press "two" now. (nothing) For a Sultry Swedish Love Goddess, press "three" now...
TOMMY: Bingo! Loretta...guy wants to speak to Inga.
LORETTA: (o.c.) Tell him to call back.      I'm basting.
TOMMY: Ja, this is Inga. Hello Paul... how are you tonight? You are feeling naughty? That's all right ...you have your what in a bowl of oatmeal? Yes, that is very naughty, and maybe a little sick.
GRANDMA: Disgusting.
GRANDMA: Tommy, please!
TOMMY: Sorry, grandma, just getting a third minute out of him.
LORETTA: You hung up on Paul? He's one of my best customers.
GRANDMA: I can't believe any relative of mine does that for a living.
LORETTA: C'mon Gramma...it's only my voice. They never actually meet me.
GRANDMA: So my granddaughter talks dirty for a living and my grandson's a thief.
TOMMY: What's up, Grandma? Are you embarrassed to show my picture around the pool?
GRANDMA: Of course I'm not. Look.
GENERAL MANAGER: I'm Ned Grable, vice president and general manager of WFLA. We think Mrs. Jeff Johnson did the right thing in not running for the congressional seat left vacant by her husband's death.
GENERAL MANAGER: Jeff Johnson's name may still be magic. But it'll take more than the magic of name recognition to solve our region's problems. I'm Ned Grable.
GRANDMA: Name recognition. Lordy, what a notion. People have to be some boobs just to vote for someone because their name is Johnson.
GRANDMA: I remember once back in Georgia, they even elected a dead man. His name was still on the ballot -- people were just used to voting for him.
TOMMY: What did you say, Grandma?
TOMMY (O.S.): Homer!    Get your ass over here!
ARMANDO: What's this about, jefe?
TOMMY: (calling) Loretta! Get off the damn phone!
ARMANDO: This better be good.
TOMMY: (sarcastic mimic) "This better be good." Loretta!
LORETTA: Oh, ya, ya, God, you're so big! (waving at Tommy) Uh-oh, I have to go now, my husband Sven is home early...
TOMMY: Goddammit, Inga, is it that pervert again! Damn!
TOMMY: (into receiver) Listen, you little shit -- I just spent eight years in the joint, nobody talks to my woman like that! I got your adress, I got a machete, I got two Rotweilers... I'm gonna come to your house and tear your ass up! (hangs up, laughing)
LORETTA: Okay, Tommy, what's so damn important?
HOMER: Yeah, I got work to do.
TOMMY: My friends, I want to tell you about a town where the streets are paved with gold. This is a town where the marks give you money before you ask. A town where they take you to dinner after you fuck 'em. A town where when they need money, they just print more. This is a town where a guy bounced nine hundred checks and he didn't even have to skip town!!!
ARMANDO: Ain't no town like that.
LORETTA: You mean Vegas?
TOMMY: No. (beat) Washington, D.C.   I'm going to run for Congress.
LORETTA: What is this, a joke?
HOMER: I don't get it.
ARMANDO: What's the con, Tommy?
TOMMY: Van Dyke.   You remember Willie Sutton?
VAN DYKE: Of blessed memory.
TOMMY: You remember what he said? They asked him, Why do you rob banks? And he said, That's where the money is. I tell you, people -- Washington. That's where the money is.
TOMMY: I found this shit in the library. You know how much a congressman makes? A hundred and thirty a year -- and that's just base pay for getting your ass elected. Then there are these things called PACs, and these lobbyists, whose whole point in life is to buy you off. It's the con of a lifetime -- and the damn thing is, it's legal! This is hot, people, we can do this!
ARMANDO: Who "we," white man?
TOMMY: You never heard of staff, Armando? I get in, I get a staff allowance of five hundred and thirty-seven grand a year --
TOMMY: -- which I will generously share with you.
LORETTA: And how exactly were you going to get your butt to Congress?
HOMER: Yeah -- why would anyone vote for you?
TOMMY: Not for me, Homer. For Jeff Johnson. Name recognition -- that's what it's all about. You think folks know their congressman died? I get on the ballot as Jeff Johnson, I guarantee they'll vote for me. Now all's I have to do is get on the ballot.
LORETTA: Which is how?
ARMANDO: You shittin' us?
HOMER: In your dreams, Tommy.
TOMMY: You people got a better idea?
VAN DYKE: I do.
TOMMY: Okay... gimme the four-one-one on these Silver Foxes Again. It's a bunch of old folks who like to vote?
VAN DYKE: Don't laugh, they get an enormous turnout. But the big thing is, they have their own line on the ballot. They already got the signatures.
TOMMY: Ah.
VAN DYKE: The lady we're meeting, Hattie Rifkin, they call her the condo queen.
TOMMY: So all I have to do is snow one old lady. Don't sound like major surgery.
HATTIE: So, what brings you here?   You want to talk politics... talk!
VAN DYKE: We were wondering who you were going to run for Congress this year.
HATTIE: Oh, the usual sacrifical lamb. Probably Sylvia Roland. She just lost her husband, she needs to meet new people. Why?
TOMMY: Mrs. Rifkin... I want to run.
HATTIE: Well, I want to run too -- but with this plastic hip, it's not gonna happen.
TOMMY: What I mean is... I'd like to run for Congress on the Silver Fox ticket. I care about you and your issues.
HATTIE: Yeah, that's what my son says. But does he call? Anyway, what makes you think a group of alter cockers are gonna support a man who hasn't clipped his first nose hair yet?
TOMMY: Because I can win.
HATTIE: No, no... a Democrat can win. A Republican can win. A Silver Fox can only make a symbolic point.
TOMMY: Mrs. RIfkin, if you give me a ballot line, and if I can get support from...
TOMMY: Sure, but... besser die viller ein der kenner.
TOMMY: She said, 'If my grandmother had balls, she'd be my grandfather.'
HATTIE: (recovering) Where the Hell did you learn to speak Yiddish?
TOMMY: The same place I learned to hustle shtarkers at gin rummy. From Morris Elfbein... the Gin King of Miami Beach.
HATTIE: No kidding... you knew the Rudolf Valentino of Dade County?
TOMMY: He taught me a great deal. He taught me you don't always need the best cards to win.
HATTIE: Maybe not in gin, but in politics, young man, you need money to win, you need a name to win, you...
TOMMY: Oh, I have a name.
HATTIE: What, you're an athlete, a movie star? I don't get out as much as I used to. You're not on MTV, are you?
TOMMY: No ma'am. My name is Johnson.      Jeff Johnson. The Name You Know.
HATTIE: Jeff Johnson. Well,     that's a name even our Alzheimer's    Group will remember. (beat; shakes    her head) Still, for a full-up    campaign, we'd need materials, we'd    need ads...
TOMMY: You leave that to me, Mrs. R.
VERA JOHNSON: I'm not sure I understand, Professor Franklin -- you wrote your doctoral thesis on my husband?
TOMMY: He was a great man, Mrs. Johnson. He did so much for my people.
VERA JOHNSON: He... did?
TOMMY: Oh, yes. I'll never forget when he said 'Welfare is a drug -- and you gotta kick it cold turkey.' It was... inspirational.
VERA JOHNSON: Really... well, I'm sure...
TOMMY: And I was actually in the audience when he said, 'If you people would just get off your dead asses and look for work, this country might be fit to live in again.' Powerful stuff.
VERA JOHNSON: It's very kind of you to say so. And you're very kind to come all the way from... where was it?
VERA JOHNSON: I see.   So you want... his papers?
TOMMY: Oh, not just his papers, Mrs. Johnson. Everything. Buttons, posters, bumper stickers. All the paraphernalia of his campaigns -- proof of his political genius. Now I realize that you may have a sentimental attachment to a few items...
VERA JOHNSON: Take 'em.
TOMMY: I beg your pardon.
VERA JOHNSON: Take 'em all. Would you like the wedding photos, too?
TOMMY: Well, I don't think that's necess...
VERA JOHNSON: Good -- that way you won't have to go rooting around in the garbage. Is there anything else?
TOMMY: Well, um... no.
VERA JOHNSON: More tea?   Or something stronger? I know it's  only ten-thirty, but, hell, sun's  over the yardarm somewhere,  right?
TOMMY: Actually, ma'am, I should be getting back.
TOMMY: Look, I, um, have a class to teach. You know how blind students are... they're so dependent. (edges toward door) Don't worry ma'am... your materials will be in good hands.
VAN DYKE: Are you sure you don't want to come to Washington with us, Homer?
HOMER: You bums got time on your hands. (indicating bait shack) I got a business to run.
LORETTA: Hello? Who? The League of Women Voters? Sorry, Mr. Johnson won't be attending the debate. No -- no, Betty, I'm sorry, I can't tie up this line. (hangs up; it RINGS) Hello? The Sarasota Star-Ledger? I'm sorry, we're out of photographs. No, you can't, Mr. Johnson has just had surgery for a deviated septum. (hangs up; it RINGS) Hello? (brightening) Ya, this is Inga.
TOMMY (V.O.): Tomorrow, vote for Jeff Johnson. The name you know.
HUSBAND: Who are we voting for Congress?
WIFE: Don't we always vote for Johnson?
HUSBAND: That's it -- Johnson.
NETWORK ANCHOR: If you're just joining us, our exit polls project that in Florida, an unknown, independent candidate whose sole asset appears to be his name may just possibly win a slim victory.
FLORIDA REPORTER #1: Is that him? Tricia, I believe Congressman-elect Johnson is coming this way.
CAMERAMAN: Jesus -- he's not... white. I actually voted for the guy. I thought he was Jeff Johnson.
TOMMY: Thank you, thank you, all of you, for your help. Give yourself a round of applause.
GRANDMA: I've never been so proud in all my life. He was always such a good boy...well, I think he meant well. Sometimes -- well he was a clean child. That's important, I think...
FLORIDA REPORTER #2: Then in Massachusetts, there was a guy named Kennedy who got elected, but he wasn't really a Kennedy.
TOMMY: We ran a positive campaign. We campaigned on the issues. The issue is leadership. Leadership for the future. Ask not what you can do for your country. The people have spoken. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. If you can't stand the heat stay out of the kitchen. Live Free or Die. And in conclusion...read my lips! (APPLAUSE and CHEERS)
TOMMY: The promised land.
VOICE (O.S.): Congressman Johnson! Congressman Johnson!
TOMMY: Reinhardt, my man! Of course! You look just like I pictured you. Nice wing tips.
REINHARDT: Thank you. Congressman, I hope you don't think I'm out of line for meeting you here -- I thought you might want some help with logistics, settling in at your hotel -- (indicating the briefcases) Since you didn't make it to the Harvard seminar, I put together a set of their papers for you.
TOMMY: I like your initiative, Reinhardt, but to tell you the truth, I've never been much of a student. Maybe you can brief my staff sometime.
TOMMY: But thank you, I will take you up on those logistics. Hey! Entourage! What hotel we at?
TOMMY: Reinhardt, it appears that the staff has neglected to nail down some details.
REINHARDT: Oh, Jesus, the IMF's in town.    Where are we going to find a room?
TOMMY: Four rooms.
REINHARDT: I got lucky at the Madison. Thank god there's been a coup in Uruguay. Their delegation just checked out.
TOMMY: You're a wizard, Reinhardt.    I knew you could handle it.
TOMMY: So when does the House open for business?
REINHARDT: Say, Congressman, you got my resume, didn't you?
TOMMY: (hasn't a clue) I'm sure I did.
REINHARDT: There's something I wanted to ask you. I know it's a big step, but -- I'd like you to consider me to be your AA.
TOMMY: That's quite an offer, Reinhardt, very decent of you, but I'm just a social drinker.
REINHARDT: No. AA. Your Administrative Assistant. I worked for Congressman Johnson. I'd like to work for you, Congressman Johnson.
TOMMY: Really.
TOMMY: Tell you what -- I'll think about it, okay?
TOMMY: (through the open window) Thanks for getting us settled, really appreciate it. (to driver) Madison Hotel.
ATTENDANT: Sorry, folks, this elevator's for Members only.
ATTENDANT: I said Members only.
TOMMY: I am a Member. Now take us to six before I haul your ass in front of the committee on disrespectful behavior.
ATTENDANT: Elevator don't go to six. You have to get off at five and walk.
TOMMY: Wait here.
TOMMY: You again!
REINHARDT: Good morning, congressman.
TOMMY: What is this shithole?
TOMMY: (gesturing, peeved) This.
REINHARDT: (casual) Oh -- you missed the freshman   lottery for offices. They assign them    by draw. You didn't show for the    draw, so you got the worst office in   Congress.
TOMMY: I missed what lottery?
REINHARDT: It was all in the briefing books I mailed you.
TOMMY: What else did I miss, Reinhardt?
REINHARDT: Are you hiring me, congressman?
TOMMY: You're shaking me down, aren't you?
TOMMY: This is fantastic, Reinhardt. I haven't been here five minutes, and you're shaking me down. God, I'm gonna love this town. You're hired, man. Just tell me what to do next. I don't want to miss out on any of the good shit.
REINHARDT: The dinner for new Members is tonight, at Union Station. Do you have black tie?
TOMMY: Let's meet some natives.
TOMMY: Tommy Johnson, how'd you do, nice party, heck of a railroad station, isn't it?
RAFE: Rafe Simon, freshman from Tulsa. And this is Bo Chandler --
BO: -- from Lufkin, Texas. You must be the one who didn't come to Harvard.
TOMMY: No, I couldn't, it was my Princeton reunion....
RAFE: Jeff Johnson? You're Jeff Johnson? The guy from Florida?
TOMMY: That's right.
RAFE: (to Bo) The rest of us are out there on the campaign trail, raising money, kissing ass, making speeches, dragging our butts from place to place -- and he slides in on pure name recognition!
RAFE: Let me tell you something, Jeff.
RAFE: Fuckin' brilliant. Tommy Thank you. Thank you both very much. (to Loretta) Isn't that nice, now, don't you think? (to Rafe and Bo) This is Miss Loretta, boys.
LORETTA: How do yo do.    How do you do.
TOMMY: And it's Tommy. My friends call me Tommy. "Jeff" is my... professional name. So what line of work were you boys in before you got elected? You lawyers or something?
RAFE: Oh, no, I did morning weather and traffic for KTOK in Tulsa.
BO: You don't remember me? I was a tight end for the Oilers -- my knee gimped out.
BO: Hey, stop by my reception after the swearing in tomorrow, okay?
RAFE: Yeah, but don't you go to his reception before you go to my reception.
TOMMY: I think we have to have a reception.
FIRST MEMBER: So then I ran an ad calling him a draft dodger, but then he ran an ad calling me a plagiarist.
SECOND MEMBER: What did you do?
FIRST MEMBER: Oh, leaked a rumor that his father- in-law was a Nazi. I went up ten points in a weekend.
TOMMY: (to Loretta) We're in the majors, doll.
KORNGOLD: Congressman? I'd like to introduce myself. Ken Korngold. National Distilled Spirits Association.
TOMMY: Tommy Johnson. Distilled Spirits, is that right?
KORNGOLD: It's super that you won, congressman. Any way we can help, please don't hesitate.
TOMMY: Pleasure's all mine, Ken, hope you can make it to my reception. Do you happen to have a card?
TOMMY: You now what I love about this place? The way everyone calls you a Member.  Every time I hear that, it makes me think of Mr. Happy here.
TOMMY: Don't you be peeing on my shoe.
IOWA: Mike Strangland. Iowa -- first CD.
TOMMY: You got a CD?    Shit, I missed that, too.
IOWA: First Congressional district.
TOMMY: Ohhh. Tommy Johnson. Florida. So Iowa -- how'd you get to Washington? You do the crop report on tv?
IOWA: No -- I owe it all to the Vietnamese.
TOMMY: War hero?
IOWA: P.O.W. When I got back to Cedar Rapids, I spent so many years telling the Rotary Club what was wrong in Washington, they finally told me to put up or shut up -- so I put up. And here I am.
IOWA: C'mon -- there's acid rain killing fish, and no one's stopping it... there's topsoil washing away, and no erosion program... there's chemicals in our livestock -- God, I sound like a Boy Scout.
TOMMY: That's alright, Iowa -- this place could use a few geeks like you.
FIRST LOBBYIST: Pete Slocum.   Asbestos Information Institute.
SECOND LOBBYIST: Mike Gustofson. Freedom to Advertise Coalition.
THIRD LOBBYIST: Paul Zeckhauser. American Tobacco Council.
TOMMY: Hey... thank you... nice to see you... hope you can make it to my reception. Have y'all met Miss Loretta?
O'CONNOR: Tommy O'Connor. Soon as I saw how you got elected, I knew you were a real comer. Hell, I bet old Olaf Andersen voted for you.
TOMMY: Who's Olaf Andersen?
O'CONNOR (O.S.): I won't tell him you asked. Chairman of Gulf Coast Power. Constituent of yours, client of mine.
TOMMY: (cautious) And how much of that do you get?
O'CONNOR: (amused) Oh,    it doesn't come off the top. Down    the road, I'll bill 'em each five    hundred an hour whenever I take    you to lunch.
TOMMY: Tommy, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.
DODGE: Tonight we unite the two great pillars of our system -- political and financial. To the forty-four newly-elected Members of Congress, I say, Look around you tonight. Look around, and be thankful for the generosity.
DODGE: You know, Mr. Johnson, it's customary for new Members to pay a courtesy call on the old fogies in the leadership. Especially from their HOME STATE.
TOMMY: Well, I would have, but I just got to town. It's an honor to meet you, sir. A real privilege. This is Miss Loretta.
LORETTA: Public liaison.
DODGE: How do you    do? (to    Tommy) You could    make up for it by having a nightcap    with me. (to    Loretta) May I have    my car take you home?
DODGE: No.  No, it's not. But -- (amused) Good thinking, Johnson. I'm impressed by your instincts.
DODGE: Tell me, Johnson. Why did you come to Washington?
TOMMY: Well... of course... it's a chance to do something for my country. I mean, there's the topsoil thing, and acid rain is killing the cattle --
DODGE: Cut the bullshit, Johnson. I saw how you got elected. Flukes like you are either nutcases or troublemakers. I just want to know which one I have on my hands. Who sent you here?
TOMMY: No one sent me.
DODGE: You pulled off that upset on your own?
TOMMY: (acknowledging modestly) Kid's got his talents.
DODGE: I'm impressed, Johnson, I am.     But why did you run for Congress?
TOMMY: No bullshit?
TOMMY: Opportunity knocks.    This town is the fuckin' Yukon.
DODGE: What a refreshing answer.
TOMMY: Food... drinks.
LORETTA: (reads card) Ken Korngold, National Distilled Spirits Association. Bob Rafferty ...Wisconsin Cheese Board. (to Tommy) What do you want me to do?
TOMMY: You're on cheese. I'll handle booze.
TOMMY (V.O.): (taking the phone) Ken! Ken Korngold! Tommy Johnson here... Right -- last night. How's it going, big guy?
KORNGOLD (V.O.): Congressman!
KORNGOLD: How are you on this helluva fine day! I'm looking forward to your reception.
KORNGOLD: You name it, congressman. Issue papers, testimony, floor speeches --
TOMMY: Tell you what I have in mind. I was just thinking, wouldn't it be a plus for old Ken Korngold if I was to -- how should I put this -- showcase some of his distillers' products at my reception? You know, like they put Reese's pieces in E.T.? It's called "product placement." People come in, they have a tremendous time, they see your products, they think well of you -- and they think well of me, too. It's good for both of us, Ken. What do you say?
KORNGOLD: Well, it's a new one on me, but hey, sure, I think we can help you out.  Say, while I have you on the line, there was one thing...
SPEAKER: Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States...
SPEAKER (V.O.): ... that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion...
SPEAKER (V.O.): ... and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter. So help you God?
TOMMY (AND MEMBERS): I do.
SPEAKER (V.O.): Congratulations. You are now Members of Congress.
GRANDMA: It's just that -- I'm so happy you straightened out.
REINHARDT: The Tommy Johnson Foundation.
TOMMY: (savoring the word) Honorarium. I like that.
LORETTA: Herring, gentlemen?
FOURTH LOBBYIST: Uh, no thanks.
LORETTA: Really? We've got it in cream sauce and in wine sauce.
TOMMY: What is this?    Where's the cheese?
LORETTA: The cheese guy didn't return my call. So I called the guy at the American Smoked Fish Institute.
TOMMY: Oh, that's just wonderful. Sixty heavy hitters drop in, and I'm feeding 'em cat food.
TOMMY: We'll talk about this later.
TOMMY: Hi   there. Glad you could make it. So   you're... Celia Kirby. That's an   extremely beautiful name. For an   extremely beautiful woman.
CELIA: Wow! That's smooth. After ten straight hours on my feet making small talk and breathing cheap cigar smoke, that's exactly the kind of line I'm ready to fall for.
TOMMY: Whoa, slow down.
CELIA: Sure, sure, forget it. Can you just tell me, which one's Congressman Johnson?
CELIA: Oh. I see. So tell me, Congressman, just how deep is the shit I'm standing in?
TOMMY: Don't worry about it. Why don't we just start over again?
CELIA: Celia Kirby. I'm the legislative director of Pro Bono.
TOMMY: Ah. Pro Bon. That's an extremely beautiful name. For an extremely beautiful organization. Um... what is it?
CELIA: (amused) We're a public interest research and advocacy group. I'd like to brief you on our priorities this session. Can I call your AA to get on your schedule?
TOMMY: Why don't you brief me over dinner tonight?
CELIA: I want an appointment, Congressman, not a date.
TOMMY: Yeah, sure, we'll type it up on the schedule, it'll be an appointment, except with wine and flowers on the table.
CELIA: No thanks.   I really should be going.
TOMMY: Won't you at least stay for a drink and some herring?
TOMMY: Well then, can I tempt you with a smelt?
CELIA: No thanks. (extending her hand) Nice to meet you. I'll be in touch with your office. I especially look forward to hearing your view on extending the sexual harassment law to include congressmen.
TOMMY: I love the way you say that.
MARSHALL: Not screw up.    Amend.
DODGE: Come on, Eli, your amendments don't have a chance in hell to pass. My bill isn't perfect, I know, but it'll pass. And the President'll sign it.
MARSHALL: "Isn't perfect"? Dick, your bill's the Incumbents Protection Act! How can you even call it an ethics bill?
DODGE: Because the public wants an ethics bill! So that's what we call it.
MARSHALL: But it's got no teeth! It won't change a thing, and you know it.
DODGE: Come on, Eli, you're a politician, too. The less you're going to do about something, the more you have to talk about it. You know that.
MARSHALL: I see. We close the bank, we stop the rubber checks, we raise the prices in the barber shop, we stop fixing parking tickets, and abracadabra! We say we've cleaned up Congress. Well, I don't think the American people want what this place has become.
DODGE: That's the beauty of it! They must, Eli -- they keep re-electing us.
MARSHALL: Not anymore! This new Congress is full of new faces.
DODGE: I live in the real world, Eli. Do you? What's unemployment up to in your district? Eight percent? Eight-five?
MARSHALL: Eight point six.
DODGE: Power and Enterprise is about to fund a solar demonstration plant, Eli. It could mean a whole lot to a district -- new jobs, new construction -- that interest you?
MARSHALL: You can't bribe me, Dick.
DODGE: Eli, the people who elected you. They sent you here to help them. Don't you want to?
MARSHALL: Not  if it means supporting your bill. All  you want is the perfect platform to  campaign for Speaker. Dick Dodge. Mr.  Clean. What a joke!
DODGE: (undeterred) Come on board, Eli. (leaning in) You know -- you can't save the world if you can't save your seat.
TOMMY: Tommy Johnson.
MARSHALL: I know. The Florida upset. Well, now that you're here, what are you going to do with it? You gonna feather your own nest, or are you gonna make something of your office?
TOMMY: I plan to be as good a congressman as all the others.
MARSHALL: Exactly what does that mean?
TOMMY: Well, ever since I got back from Nam, I've wanted to do something about the rain forest --
MARSHALL: No, do me a favor, don't tell me. I try not to get depressed until the second week of a new session.
DODGE: (ushering Tommy into his office) Eli, you'll excuse us -- we have a meeting.
TOMMY: Is this good news?
TOMMY: So... this is very good news.
DODGE: Most members would give their right nut for it.
TOMMY: So what do you want from me, Dick?
DODGE: Congressman... I just want you to smile for the cameras.
REINHARDT: (indicating dais) So, Congressman, welcome to the honey pot. You should be one happy freshman.
TOMMY: Yeah? Well, I'm not. I'm suspicious. One thing I've learned is, when somebody gives you something for nothing, the nothing ain't nothing. It's something. What is it? Why me?
TOMMY: Keep talking.
REINHARDT: Dodge wants to run for Speaker. And he ain't gonna make it without votes from the black caucus.
DODGE: Tommy, someone I want you to meet...
DODGE: Skeeter, do you know Tommy Johnson? Meet the new member of the committee. Tommy, this is Barclay Warburton.
TOMMY: Pleased to meet you, Barclay.
WARBURTON: Skeeter. Please. Been called that since boarding school.
TOMMY: Skeeter.
WARBURTON: Damned fine to meet you.
TOMMY: "Tommy. Please. Been called that since reform school."
DODGE: This EPA oversight hearing of the Committee on Power and Industry will come to order. I'd like to welcome our first witness, the distinguished Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency... (Warburton nods) ... but before I do, I note that a new Member is joining us today, the distinguished gentleman from Florida.
FIFTH LOBBYIST: Morning. Ron Yaeger. Snack-PAC -- Snack Foods Political Action Committee. I have a ten o'clock.
LORETTA: Please have a seat. The congressman is running just a little bit late.
VAN DYKE: Would you care for some herring?
TOMMY: My man.
TELEPHONE MAN: Tommy!    What's up, man?
TOMMY: (whispering) Sweet Sue. Third race at Santa Anita.
TOMMY: Hey, how you folks doin', good to see you, Van Dyke making you comfortable?
TOMMY: She in there?
TOMMY: Stick around for this, Reinhardt. I've finally figured something out about the women in this town.
CELIA: Thank you for seeing us, congressman, we won't take up much of your time. This is Ira Schecter, our research director.
TJ: Hi, good to meet you, you folks know Reinhardt, don't you? Don't rush, Miss Kirby, we can take as long as we want.
CELIA: But you have people waiting, and --
TOMMY: That's all right. They can wait.
CELIA: Well.
CELIA: These are issue papers. This session we're targeting auto insurance premiums, child safety, and food additives.   As votes come up, we know you'll be hearing plenty from the other side. We'd just like a clean shot at making our case, too.
TOMMY: Wait a minute, you just got here. I clean my calendar, and you're out the door. Let's back up, give this stuff the attention it deserves. Car insurance... Ira, what do you pay?
IRA: Oh, I've got an '85 Plymouth, about six-fifty a year...
TOMMY: Six-fifty? Highway robbery! A chop shop wouldn't give you more than a hundred forty for a junker like that. (beat) Or so I've heard. (beat) But I'm flying blind here, I need depth. Could Miss Kirby put together a briefing? Maybe schedule a Saturday or two to really dig into the issues?
IRA: (surprised and pleased) Oh... we'd be delighted. We've got some figures that will amaze you.
TOMMY: I'm sure you do.
CELIA: (rising) Well, we won't take up any more...
TOMMY: Whoa, whoa, hold on, what about child safety?
CELIA: Well, we're sponsoring a bill imposing safety standards on imported toys...
IRA: Celia, if that's what the Congressman wants... any problem?
CELIA: (to him) You want to do this in the evening?
IRA: I'm away for the next two weeks.
IRA: So, when can Celia start your briefings?
TOMMY: Saturday night?
IRA: Saturday night sounds fine.
CELIA: Fine. Wednesday morning.      Nine- fifteen.
TOMMY: Let's get serious, fellas.
MARSHALL: I need your help on the ethics bill, Leon. I want you to co- sponsor my amendments.
BULLDOG: You make a persuasive case, Eli.
MARSHALL: That wasn't a yes.
BULLDOG: (courteously ambiguous) I promise to give it the attention it deserves.
BULLDOG: Better luck next time, son.
MARSHALL: He took six hundred dollars off you that last hand, didn't he?
TOMMY: Yeah, he's taking a real shine to me.
MARSHALL: If I didn't know better, I'd say you lost to him on purpose.
TOMMY: Nothing wrong with letting the chairman of the ethics committee roll you once in a while.
TOMMY: So Eli, how come you haven't asked for my help with your amendments?
MARSHALL: Give it a rest, Tommy. You've got a great jump shot. But everyone knows you're Dick Dodge's boy.
TOMMY: (bristling) I'm nobody's boy, mister.
MARSHALL: (weary) Don't waste your outrage on me. I know what you are.
TOMMY: I'm no different from anyone else.
MARSHALL: That's not true. Some people here actually try to do something besides save their own ass.
TOMMY: You know, Eli, I like you, I really do. You remind me of my father.
MARSHALL: Oh, really?   How so?
TOMMY: He thought I was scum, too.
MARSHALL: Aren't you going to vote?
TOMMY: (indicating clocks) Vote? Is that what that is? We got a pool going in the office on when it'll go off next.
TEACHER: Excuse me -- Congressman? Do you have a moment? We're from the Hawthorne Avenue School, in Union, New Jersey? I'm Mrs. Kozlowski. Social Studies. We were just learning how a bill becomes a law. (indicating the
BELLS): Was that a vote?
TOMMY: Yes, it was.
TEACHER: And what did you vote?
TOMMY: I voted "Nay." It's a terrible bill. It'd destroy the fabric of American life.
TEACHER: And what was the vote on?
TOMMY: Hey, Rafe! Tell these kids what that vote was about.
RAFE: Well, it was a motion to reconsider the motion to reconsider.
BO: No, it was the rule on amending the reauthorization.
TOMMY: Which means?
BO: Clean Air.
RAFE: (overlapping) School lunches.
TOMMY: You're in excellent hands, kids.
O'CONNOR: You're a gentleman, Tommy. We can always do bid'ness -- I like that in a Member.
TOMMY: Thank you, Tommy. I love you too.
O'CONNOR: Listen, I'd like to do more money for you -- I just need to know your positions on a few issues.
O'CONNOR: For instance, where are you on sugar price supports?
TOMMY: Sugar price supports. Where do you think I should be, Tommy?
O'CONNOR: Shit -- makes no difference to me. If you're for 'em, I got money for you from my sugar producers in Louisiana and Hawaii. If you're against 'em, I got money for you from the candy manufacturers.
TOMMY: You pick.
O'CONNOR: (writing) Let's put you down as for. Now what about putting limits on malpractice awards?
TOMMY: You tell me.
O'CONNOR: Well, if you're for 'em, I got money from the doctors and insurance companies. If you're against 'em, I got money from the trial lawyers. Tell you what, let's say against. Now how about pizza?
TOMMY: (indicating his plate) I'll stick with the salad.
O'CONNOR: Not for lunch, shmuck, for PAC money. A lot of the frozen pizzas use phony cheese. There's a law pending requiring them to disclose it on their labels. Where do you stand?
TOMMY: If I vote for the labels...then I get money from the dairy industry...
TOMMY: And if I vote against the labels, I get money from the frozen food guys.
O'CONNOR: Excellent! And don't forget the ranchers, because they get hurt if pepperoni sales go down!
TOMMY: (laughing in admiration) A pepperoni lobby. I love this town.
O'CONNOR: So which is it?
TOMMY: Fuck the cheese people. Thanks to them my office smelled like smelt for a week.
O'CONNOR: All right.    For.
TOMMY: So Tommy, tell me -- with all this money on every side, how does anything get done?
O'CONNOR: It doesn't!    That's the genius of the system!
CELIA: It comes down to a question of what is acceptable risk. Are we willing to feed our kids a substance that causes cancer in lab rats? More important, who gets to make the decision? Bureaucrats and big corporations, or the people whose lives depend on it?
VAN DYKE: Mr. Willie? Congressman Johnson is calling. Can you take his call? Thank you. Please hold.
VAN DYKE: I'm sorry, Mr. Willie, he just picked up another call. Listen, I know why he was calling -- he hasn't heard from you about his fundraiser...
ARMANDO: ... That's right, Mr. Brown, on the thirtieth... A thousand a couple...A whole table? He'll be so happy to hear it. Thank you so much. (calling) Loretta! Put down nuclear power for ten g's.
LORETTA: Cool. (into phone) Mr. Newburg? It's Miss Loretta, from Congressman Johnson's office, how you doin'?
LORETTA: Say, the congressman's going to be out your way next week... Palm Springs, the Bob Hope Classic -- yes, a celebrity player. As long as he's on the coast, we were wondering whether you aerospace people might want to lay on a lunch so you can hear his views... Uh-huh ... Uh-huh... Lovely. Now what kind of contribution to his foundation you folks thinking about?
CELIA: ...And in the 1988 study, it was up to eight per hundred-thousand. Um...am I losing you on these mortality rates?
TOMMY: No, I was just wondering how much of this is a statutory problem, and how much is a regulatory one? I mean, didn't the Merton Act cover most of this?
CELIA: (surprised) Hmmm, that's an excellent point. Let me see something...
TOMMY: Well, for Merton to apply you have to show high contagion...sounds to me like your contagion rates are no higher than the common clod.
TOMMY: Common cold. (beat) Must have picked up a little dyslexia over the weekend.
CELIA: I see. Well, I must say I'm pretty impressed.
TOMMY: You're also impressively pretty.
CELIA: Oh come on...
TOMMY: You're right. Sorry.      Excuse me a second. (calls out) Arthur?
REINHARDT (O.S.): Ow!
GUN LOBBYIST: Frankly, we    think the semi-automatic has gotten a    bad rap. That's why the American    Sporting Gun Users PAC put together    this trip.
TOMMY: Must have had a heart attack.
BOB HOPE: I knew all these congressmen get a slice, but I didn't know it was that big.
TOMMY: Did you miss me?
CELIA: Where did you go?
CELIA: More like the Petroleum Institute Ski Cup, the NRA Open, the --
TOMMY: Hey.    Have lunch with me tomorrow.
CELIA: I can't -- we're having a press conference.
TOMMY: What is it -- the ozone layer?     No fault? Killer apples?
TOMMY: (beaming) You remembered! That means you missed me.
TOMMY: So, how'd you end up hustling for Pro Bono instead of pesticides? I mean, you could have been a big- time lawyer, right?
CELIA: Oh, I was for a while.   It... depressed me.
TOMMY: At a hundred grand a year, how depressed can you get? Doesn't it depress you to lose all the time?
CELIA: Sometimes. Mostly it gets me angry. And the anger keeps me going. Sure, I wouldn't mind winning a few. And it's not like I'm allergic to money...
TOMMY: So why do you do it?
CELIA: God, it's so embarrassing to come out and say it.
TOMMY: Say it.
CELIA: Meaning. I need my life to mean something.
CELIA: My question is, how'd you get named after a Memorial?
TOMMY: Grandma like Jefferson. Y'know, "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." It's a lot to live up to, so I specialized in the last part.
CELIA: And how's the pursuit going?
TOMMY: Fine...'til I met you. Now...the better I do, the worse I feel.
TOMMY: So...when can I see you again? How about dinner Saturday night?
CELIA: How about Sunday morning?
TOMMY: Brunch?
MARSHALL: The wages of sin is death! And to the man who values Gold over Goodness...the Lord allows no exemptions!
MARSHALL: To the man who shows no respect for the privilege of walking this Earth, God allows no deductions!
(AMEN): And when the last trump sounds, believe me, you will be audited!
TOMMY: (aside to Celia) This is one hell of a date.
MARSHALL: Hello, darling. Glad you could make it.
CELIA: I liked the sermon, Uncle Eli.
TOMMY: Uncle Eli?
MARSHALL: My niece says you're not half as slimy as I thought.
TOMMY: Your niece?
MARSHALL: That would put you somewhere between a lizard and a toad. Quite a step up.
TOMMY: How could I have missed the family resemblance?
TOMMY: Ladies! Looking good!   How can I help you folks today!
HATTIE: Don't "Ladies!" me, you dick!
TOMMY: The Medical Association made a persuasive case. Ten grand from their PAC, plus Christmas in Aspen.
DODGE: (shaking his head) Tommy -- if I'm not mistaken, you wouldn't be here without the good senior citizens of your district. You got to dance with the girl that brung you, son. If you have a bit of business to do, do it quietly... in the corridors... in the subcommittees... with little amendments. You mess around on the big ones like Medicare, you'll be dead meat on election day.
TOMMY: Yeah, well, then it's thanks for the memories, and on to the next gig.
DODGE: Do you know what your problem is, son? You don't think big enough. You have a real knack for this town, but you have the soul of a two-bit hustler. Listen to me, Tommy.
TOMMY: Which is?
DODGE: Getting re-elected.
TOMMY: Wait a minute. You're talkin' 'bout my re-election?
DODGE: You don't know what percent of the incumbents who ran last time got re-elected, do you?
TOMMY: Fifty?   Sixty?
DODGE: Ninety-six. And ninety-eight before that. It's like that election after election. If you don't fuck up, you can be here, raking it in, for life. Life, Johnson.
TOMMY: I can think of worse places to get life.
DODGE: (smiles) I knew you had it in you.
TOMMY: So how do I get the Silver Foxes off my ass?
DODGE: Oh, throw them a bone... why don't you co-sponsor a bill for mandatory universal health insurance?
DODGE: Nothing.   It'll never pass.
VAN DYKE: May I help you?
MRS. JUBA: Yes, I'm Ellen Juba. This is my daughter, Mickey. We'd like to see our congressman. We live in the district.
VAN DYKE: Just a moment, please. (dials; into phone) Could you come out? Thank you. (hanging up) Be right with you. (to Mickey) I like your hat.
LORETTA: How do you do, I'm Miss Loretta, public liaison for the congressman.
MRS. JUBA: Ellen Juba. My daughter Mickey. We'd like to see him.
LORETTA: Y'all from the district? Up    here seein' the sights? How'd you    folks like some gallery passes? Go    on over and listen to the great   debates of our day?
MICKEY: We don't want to go to the gallery. We want to see Congressman Johnson.
MRS. JUBA: You don't understand. We're not tourists. We're constitutents.
LORETTA: (helpfully) You aren't with some organization, are you, honey?
MRS. JUBA: I'm a goddam citizen! Isn't that enough!
MICKEY: We're not leaving here till we see him!
LORETTA: Oh, Armando? Could you come out front, please?
TOMMY: Look what I won! Must be that new racket.
ARMANDO: There a problem, congressman?
MRS. JUBA: Congressman?   You?
MRS. JUBA: Get your hands off me!
MICKEY: Let go of her, you creep!
MICKEY: Stop it!     Get away from her!
MICKEY: Come on, Ma.      It's okay.    Let's go.
TOMMY: Wait.     What happened to you?
MICKEY: I was lucky. They said they got it all. I'm going to be okay. But what about the others?
TOMMY: The others?
MRS. JUBA: They call it a "cancer cluster." Oh, at first, none of us in the neighborhood wanted to believe it, but then we all saw it -- for me, it was when the two-year-old across the street developed a brain tumor, same as Mickey. We looked at everything -- the water, the air, dump sites, insects, you name it. But we didn't have to look that far. It was staring us in the face.
TOMMY: What?
MRS. JUBA: High-voltage power lines. The wires cause magnetic fields -- and the magnetic fields cause cancer. Especially in children.
TOMMY: I never heard of that.
MRS. JUBA: The studies, the numbers -- it's all there.
MICKEY: (to Tommy, skeptical) You're not actually going to read those, are you?
TOMMY: (caught) Oh, they'll be read...
MICKEY: Why don't you come see for yourself?
MRS. JUBA: Five children   in the neighborhood have cancer.    One more has precancerous   lesions. Pregnant women around   here are scared to death.
MRS. JUBA: Turns out a lot of schools are near power lines. The land's cheap, so the schools tend to buy it from the power companies in the first place.
TOMMY: But isn't the school district responsible?
MRS. JUBA: We asked the superintendent to measure the magnetic field inside the school. He said, Okay, only it'll cost forty thousand dollars, and what program did we want him to cut that from?
TOMMY: Nice.
MRS. JUBA: We're nobody, congressman. You're somebody. We need your help.
TOMMY: Do you believe it?
CELIA: It's impossible to know. No one's really looked into it hard enough.
TOMMY: But why isn't it being investigated?
CELIA: Why didn't they investigate breast implants all those years? What about those side-effects of that sleeping pill, Halcion? Why isn't anything being investigated? It's always the same.
TOMMY: Money talks.
CELIA: You got it.
CELIA: Don't tell me you're actually developing a conscience.
TOMMY: Shit, I hope not -- it'd be a fucking nuisance in Congress.
CELIA: No, that's not fair. Some people on the Hill actually believe in things, and try to do a decent job, and don't forget why they went to Washington, and who sent them.
TOMMY: (amazed) No shit. (remembering) Oh, yeah, I met one of those geeks. So what can I do?
CELIA: Make a stink. Round up some Members and hold a press conference. Get that committee of yours to hold hearings. Haul in in the Environmental Protection Agency, the Surgeon General, the National Academy of Sciences. Get the issue on every breakfast table in America.
IOWA: This goes beyond personal tragedy. It goes to a public health hazard of unknown proportions. It goes to the right of ordinary people to know all the facts --
DODGE (O.S.): Amen, gentleman. Amen.
DODGE: What a fine effort this is. I am totally sympathetic. Congressional hearings should be scheduled as soon as possible. The American people deserve no less.
DODGE: Message:   we care.
CELIA: Well, congratulations. You've found yourself your own hopeless cause.
TOMMY: Speaking of hopeless causes...
DODGE: (pouring) On the rocks, or neat?
TOMMY: Whatever you're having.
TOMMY: Cheers.
DODGE: Son, you're a real comer. I wouldn't be surprised if you ended up in the leadership. I'll say this: if I were Speaker, I'd sleep better with you as a lieutenant.
TOMMY: Why, thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, to tell you the truth, I didn't know you'd be on my side on those power lines.
DODGE: But I'm not.
TOMMY: But you said you were sympathetic --
DODGE: Of course I did. We're all sympathetic to little girls with cancer. But I'm not sympathetic to holding an inquiry.
TOMMY: But you said --
DODGE: I know what I said. But that was just a press conference, son. I wasn't under oath.
DODGE: (into phone) Yes?... Bring them right in! (hanging up) Look. Son. It's great to get your name in the paper.
DODGE: What a surprise!
ANDERSEN: Mr. Chairman!
DODGE: Mr. Chairman! Hello, Tommy. Zeke you're looking well, good to see you.
ZEKE: (wheezing) Good to see you, you old sum' bitch.
O'CONNOR: Evening, Mr. Chairman, thanks for taking the -- Tommy, you s.o.b., they let you in here? (indicating Andersen and Bridges) You folks finally get to press flesh! Olaf, meet Tommy Johnson. Tommy, Olaf Andersen. Chairman of Gulf Coast Power.
TOMMY: The boys here have told me a lot about you.
O'CONNOR: Yeah -- I told him you voted for him!
ANDERSEN: Glad to meet you, son. They tell me you've got a real talent for the game.
ZEKE: (still puzzling) Congressman.
TOMMY: Good to meet you.
DODGE: Help me with these, would you, Tommy?
TOMMY: (to Zeke) Chivas on the rocks?
ZEKE: (taking the drink) You look awfully familiar.
DODGE: Tommy and I were just talking about power lines.
TOMMY: Yeah, what a coincidence. I thought this little party might be for me. (to Anderson) You may not like this. (to Dodge) I think we should hold those hearings.
DODGE: You really fell for the line that parents group fed you, didn't you?
TOMMY: How'd you know I met the parents group?
ANDERSEN: It's tragic, cancer's a terrible thing, but there's no way you can link it to power lines. Truth is, there's a bigger electromagnetic field given off by an electric blanket, or a microwave oven, than by those derricks.
TOMMY: But there are studies that say --
ZEKE: For every study that says one thing, I'll show you a study saying another. We've studied it ourselves. Nada.
ANDERSEN: There's not a single state health official anywhere in this country who says power lines cause cancer.
TOMMY: But what if you're wrong?
TOMMY: People didn't use to say smoking causes cancer, either. What if the evidence is just building, and some day we wake up and discover that your power lines are killing us?
ANDERSEN: (exploding) "Kill  us"? "Kill us"? You calling me a  murderer? You're saying there's blood  on these hands? How dare you talk  to me like that, you --
O'CONNOR: Calm down, Olaf, calm down, he didn't mean it that way, did you, son? Alright, gentlemen. Easy.
ANDERSEN: Tommy -- do you want to move the power lines? Do you know how much it would cost to bury them? Millions. Tens of millions. I don't have that money. The state doesn't have that money. You people up here sure don't have that money. You know who'd end up paying for it? Folks who sent you here, that's who.
O'CONNOR: Now how'd you like the   people in your district to think   of you as the putz who tripled their   electric bill? You think they'd thank   you for that on election day?
TOMMY: All I'm saying is, maybe we should hold hearings to look at --
O'CONNOR: Think for a minute, boychik. You hold your hearings. Overnight, everyone who lives near a substation finds the value of his home in the toilet. You kill the real estate market.
ZEKE: You kill the insurance companies.
O'CONNOR: You kill the school district.
ANDERSON: You kill the local economy.
DODGE: For a smart boy, you're not thinking very politically.
TOMMY: Maybe I should think about it.
ANDERSEN: Oh, by the    way, Tommy, on a completely different    subject -- You don't have a state PAC    yet, do you? I'd like to give you a    hundred thousand dollar corporate    contribution to start one up.
ZEKE: My company would be honored to do the same.
TJ: Can you do that?     I thought there were limits --
O'CONNOR: Oh, it's all aboveboard, we all believe deeply in the rules. It's just that the state rules are often more flexible about these things.
ANDERSEN: Are you interested?
TJ: I'm always interested in the happiness of my constituents.
DODGE: I'll drink to that.
CELIA: Mmmm...
CELIA: So what did he say?
TOMMY: Who?
CELIA: Dodge.    The hearings.
TOMMY: Oh -- I, uh, haven't asked him yet.
TOMMY: (casual) It wasn't the right moment. Besides, I was thinking, maybe I ought to line up some other Members first -- you know, get my ducks in a row.
CELIA: Oh.
DODGE: You see that ABC poll?
THIRD MEMBER: Free fall.
DODGE: President in trouble like that, he's liable to do something desperate. Some damn fool stunt.
FOURTH MEMBER: Invade Japan.
FIFTH MEMBER: Declare war on Congress, more like it.
MARSHALL: You shafted me on the ethics bill.
MARSHALL: It's a closed rule. I can't get my amendments on the floor. I can't get a recorded vote. I can't get squat.
DODGE: Last time I looked, it was the Rules Committee in charge of that. This isn't the Rules Committee, Eli. This is the steam room.
MARSHALL: This is the U.S. Congress! The American people deserve better than --
DODGE: You know what your problem is, Eli? You've got sermonitis.
DODGE: Can't open your mouth without climbing into the pulpit, can you? Why don't you just calm down, have a massage --
MARSHALL: I've got news for you, Dick. I'm going to run against you for Speaker. I may not have a rat's ass of a chance to beat you. But I sure as hell can tell the world the kind of sleaze you stand for.
TOMMY: Oh, I don't know...
DODGE: Come on, you play basketball together, you're seeing his niece, you've been to his church --
TOMMY: How did you know that?
DODGE: He'll listen to you, Tommy. I want you to go make peace between us. Tell him we'll work something out on his amendments -- not a vote, I won't go that far, but at least he'll get to say his piece on the floor. Just get him off my back. Can you do that for me?
TOMMY: That's not a question, is it?
DODGE: That's right.     Is there a problem?
TOMMY: No, no -- I've still got my right nut, I can work with that.
WAITER: Another?
TOMMY: Sure, why not.
MARSHALL: The honorable Dick Dodge.
TOMMY: You know, Eli, sometimes people do things they regret. Everyone makes mistakes. Fact is, Dick's been under a lot of pressure lately --
MARSHALL: That man's a walking quid quo pro -- prid quo -- quid pro quo, and you know it. He put you up to this, didn't he?
MARSHALL: Don't shit me, Tommy. You're Dick Dodge's yes-man. I know what you're up to. This is damage control.
TOMMY: I'm not a yes-man. When Dick says no, I say no.
MARSHALL: You know why no one on the Hill drops a dime on anyone else? Mutual assured destruction. Our little gentleman's agreement. Everybody has something on somebody, so nobody has anything on anybody, because everybody wants to save his own ass.
TOMMY: (interested) Oh, yeah? What do they have on you?
MARSHALL: They think I'm a pompous ass.
TOMMY: Shit, that ain't no secret.
LORETTA: You sure they don't want to be alone, Reinhardt?
REINHARDT: No, no -- I bet they've been talking about the ethics bill all night. Come on, Loretta, you'll know how to get Marshall's mind off business.
LORETTA: Well, as I live and breathe.   Tommy!
TOMMY: Eli, this is Loretta Hicks, from my staff. Loretta, Congressman Marshall.
LORETTA: Pleasure to meet you.
MARSHALL: Entirely mine.
TOMMY: You know Reinhardt, my AA?
REINHARDT: Excuse me, congressman, could I just do a couple of quick calendar things with you?
MARSHALL: (to Loretta) Would you care for a drink?
LORETTA: Tell you the truth, nothing for me.
MARSHALL: Well, when a pretty lady shoots him down, an old man knows it's time to go home.
MARSHALL: You kids have a good time.
REINHARDT: (indicating pitcher) Listen, you gentlemen look like you've had a few -- Loretta, why don't you be a designated driver?
MARSHALL: Ah.    The good Samaritan.
LORETTA: Good night, y'all.
REINHARDT: Now we've already got the Bankruptcy Institute breakfast tomorrow, but if you don't mind we could wedge in the Prune Board --
TOMMY: I'm packing it in.
REINHARDT: (also rising) Can we talk while I drive you?
TOMMY: Thanks, I'll walk. I could use the air.
LORETTA: Come on, honey, no use you getting mugged.
TOMMY: Loretta!   Please! Your mouth!
TOMMY: I need an ambulance right away.
TOMMY: Evening, Mrs. Dodge, Tommy Johnson here, sorry to call at this hour, is Dick back from the Gridiron dinner yet? Could I speak with him for just a moment?
MRS. DODGE: Tommy Johnson.
TOMMY: How did you know?
DODGE: Good news doesn't come at this hour.
TOMMY: I went out with Marshall. We got into an accident. He's out cold. I'm okay.
DODGE: Were you driving?
TOMMY: No.   Someone else. Loretta.
DODGE: The girl from your office?
TOMMY: Yeah. She's out, too. I don't like the way it looks. For anybody. Look. You said you wanted to get back into Marshall's good graces. Well, here's an opportunity.
DODGE: Listen carefully. Tell the ambulance to take you to Walter Reed. It's a privilege they give congressmen. It's also the only hospital without a bunch of goddam reporters shtupping the nurses in exchange for leaks. They'll keep it quiet. I'll handle the police. You go home and keep your mouth shut.
WASHINGTON ANCHOR (V.O.): ... and the Beltway is bumper-to bumper, so you might as well take a day of annual leave and enjoy yourself. At the top of the news, Maryland Congressman Elijah Marshall is in satisfactory condition at Walter Reed Hospital after an overnight accident in the District.
CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Tom. Marshall reportedly had alcohol in his blood. Also slightly injured was an unidentified woman whom police say has a record in several states for prostitution.
TOMMY: Oh sweet Jesus.
WASHINGTON ANCHOR: Linda, Congressman Marshall -- that's Reverend Marshall, isn't it?
CORRESPONDENT: Right you are, Tom. How this plays into his longstanding campaign to reform congressinoal ethics is now anyone's guess.
WASHINGTON ANCHOR: Thank you.   In other news...
CELIA: And get away from me.
TOMMY: I have to talk to you.
CELIA: Go away!
TOMMY: I was set up!
CELIA: You were set up? You were in the car! I didn't hear your name on the news!
TOMMY: No, someone screwed him --
CELIA: "Someone"?
TOMMY: Celia, something stinks here --
CELIA: Yeah -- it's you! You don't give a damn about anything! And to think, the other night, I actually thought you cared about someone else.
CELIA: Not me, you jerk -- Mickey Juba! You caved on those power lines, didn't you? I knew it. Damn it, I knew it! What did you get for it? Tommy O'Connor's box at the Redskins? Someone slip you a condo in the Virgin Islands?
TOMMY: If you'd give me a chance to --
TOMMY: Celia --
CELIA: Get the hell out of here.
MICKEY: Is it thumb over, or thumb under?
TOMMY: Under.
TOMMY: Not bad, kid.    You've got potential.
MICKEY: So what's happening? I thought you were going to kick some ass on --
TOMMY: I am.
TOMMY: This is one's called the double duke. How many players?
MICKEY: Six.
TOMMY: Who's the mark?
MICKEY: Number two -- over there.
TOMMY: Your deal.
TOMMY: Look at the sucker's hand.
TOMMY: Look at your hand.
MICKEY: That's what you're going to do?
MICKEY: Let's kick some ass.    What do I do?
TOMMY: Something very important.
VAN DYKE: Why are we meeting here, Tommy? There trouble at the office?
TOMMY: (impersonating Dodge) "I keep my ear close to the ground." His ear my ass. He had an inside man.
ARMANDO: That little fuck Reinhardt?
TOMMY: We got bigger fish to fry, darlin'.
VAN DYKE: What do we do?
TOMMY: (beat) The big con.
LORETTA: We gonna git that sucker.
TOMMY: Dick always said I should think big.
ARMANDO: Whoa! Aren't we gettin' out of our league, man? That Dodge is a pro!
VAN DYKE: You can't con a con, Congressman.
LORETTA: Shit, that's right, Tommy -- these politicians are serious slick fish.
TOMMY: You people gone soft on me? Bunch of fuckin' incumbents I got here. Now listen up. Thursday morning Dodge has a breakfast with the Arts Caucus in the Longworth Room. Armando -- find out how fast I can get from Longworth to my office. Loretta -- we need some scoop from the EPA for the roper, I'll give you a list. Van Dyke -- call Hattie at the Silver Foxes, and --
LORETTA: Wait a minute -- we need a new roper, don't we? Everyone around here knows our faces.
TOMMY: My man!
TOMMY: Now let's get to work.
TOMMY: Eli Marshall caught his tail in a crack, didn't he?
DODGE: He did.
TOMMY: You kept my name out of it.
DODGE: I did.
TOMMY: I owe you one.
DODGE: (pleased) You learn fast.
TOMMY: Do me one favor, Dick. Next time you pull some heavy shit involving my ass, tip me off, okay?
DODGE: (indulgent chuckle) Alright, son. (BANGS gavel) This hearing of the Power and Enterprise Committee is now in order. The health of America's securities industry --
TOMMY: (whispering) Thanks. Listen, Reinhardt, something's come up, and I don't quite know how to handle it. There's a guy from the EPA -- I don't know him -- says he wants to see me. Tonight. Out of the office. Alone, he says. Sound of it makes me nervous. I'd feel better if you were there.
REINHARDT: You got it, jefe.
TOMMY: Mr. Yancey?
HOMER: (cold) I thought you'd be alone.
TOMMY: He's my AA. He goes where I go. If you can trust me, you can trust him.
HOMER: Congressman, I have information I think you may want. It's about something going on at the EPA.
TOMMY: What have you got?
HOMER: I got a wife and three kids, and a note on my house, that's what I got.
REINHARDT: (whispering) You can't do that!
TOMMY: (to Homer) This stuff's pretty good?
HOMER: In the right hands, it could mean a great deal.
TOMMY: Okay. Sunday. Fifth race at Del Mar. Blueboy is running twenty to one. I'd take a major position.
HOMER: You have to be shitting me.
TOMMY: No, not at all -- my Cousin Henry spends his days pumping water into horses' stomachs and stuffing Percodan up their butts. Trust me.
HOMER: (after a moment) Alright. The White House is putting heat on the EPA. They want us to announce a major investigation of the relation between power lines and cancer clusters.
REINHARDT: But didn't the EPA already do a study?
HOMER: Yeah, but when the draft got to the White House, they didn't like it. So they brought their own scientists in to kill it.
HOMER: Who knows?
TOMMY: Is there new evidence?
HOMER: Yeah -- their polls have dropped like a rock. They need an issue. This one makes them look good on the environment, and they don't have to spend a penny.
TOMMY: And what good is this to me?
HOMER: Come on, congressman, in this town, information is currency. And advance information is gold.
HOMER: But you've    got to move fast. Once the White    House goes public with this, they    can't turn back. If your friends at    the power company want to kill this    investigation, they'd better do it now.     Evening, gentlemen.
REINHARDT: Blueboy. Twenty to one. Is your Cousin Henry always right?
TOMMY: I ain't got no Cousin Henry.
MRS. DODGE'S VOICE (V.O.): Hello?
DODGE (V.O.): Hello?
REINHARDT: Are you sitting down?
THIRD MEMBER: Unless there is further business, our caucus stands adjourned.
TOMMY: Got a minute, Dick?
TOMMY: Listen, Dick, I heard something. There's got to be some bid'ness in it.
TOMMY: Maybe we can go in on it together.
DODGE: I'm listening.
TOMMY: The EPA is going to make a stink about power lines. The White House is pushing them to do a big study.
DODGE: That's very interesting, my friend. I've heard that, too.
TOMMY: (acting surprised) Nothing gets by, do it?
TOMMY: I -- I hope it wasn't my press conference that started this.
DODGE: No, this is a stunt for the polls.
TOMMY: So do you think there's something in it for us?
DODGE: (musing) If we got the EPA off Olaf Andersen's back, he'd be extremely appreciative.
TOMMY: And how do we do that?
DODGE: My committee writes the EPA's programs. We audit their funds. We confirm their appointees. I've got them by the balls.
TOMMY: And you're going to -- ?
DODGE: Oh, no, not at all -- just... persuasion. Strenuous persuasion.
TOMMY: That's allowed?
DODGE: Persuasion, yes. Intimidation, no. But it's a gray area. Who's to say which is which?
TOMMY: Dick, wait a minute -- shouldn't we check out the tip? Make sure the EPA's really going through with this investigation?
TOMMY: Who?
DODGE: Skeeter Warburton, of course. Always go right to the top, son.
DODGE: Get me the EPA Administrator, please.
TOMMY: There's a vote on the floor.
VAN DYKE: Here he comes.
TELEPHONE MAN: And there he goes.
LORETTA: Office of the Adminstrator. (listens) Thank you, I'll put you right through.
TOMMY: Warbuton here. (listens) Thank you. (waits) Mr. Chairman! I do hope there's something I can help you with today.
TOMMY: Off the record?
DODGE: Of course.
TOMMY: I was looking forward to some serious sailing this week -- Tish and I have a lovely spot right by Kennebunkport. Instead, here I am at three in the morning, writing testimony to your committee about cancer clusters.
DODGE: Thanks for your candor, Warburton.
TOMMY: Not at all. You must come sailing with us. Cheers. Bye-bye.
TOMMY: Next.
SECRETARY (V.O.): Zeke Bridges on line two.
TOMMY: Olaf? (coughs) Olaf, Zeke Bridges. Listen, you sum' bitch, I'm so mad, I can't sit down to shit. Have you heard what I heard? (wheezes)
ANDERSEN: What's that.
TOMMY: The EPA's fixing to make a big stink about power lines and cancer. They're going to serve us up for breakfast.
ANDERSEN: Wait a minute. There's no scientific proof --
TOMMY: Proof don't mean shit. We're talking politics. They make a federal case out of power lines, I'm screwed. Whole insurance business is screwed. You know how much cash I'd have to pay out in settlements? Even if I stiffed everybody on claims, the legal fees'd be enough to kill me.
ANDERSEN: I can't believe it.
DODGE: Olaf will be at my office at five o'clock.
TOMMY: How do we play it?
DODGE: Cool. Real cool. You just follow my lead.
ANDERSEN: This is my lifeblood!
DODGE: I see that, Olaf, I see that. But in this town, you pick your fights.
ANDERSEN: This could mean six figures, Dick.
ANDERSEN: High six figures.
TOMMY: Between us. It's not that much -- what can you get for half a million these days?
ANDERSEN: How the hell can I funnel that kind of money to you?
O'CONNOR: If that's what you want, we can always find a loophole. No one will see your fingerprints.
ANDERSEN: No one will know?
DODGE: No one will know.
O'CONNOR: You're only in trouble if someone can prove a connection.
DODGE: Of course there's no connection. Olaf's just making a contribution as a patriotic citizen. And in return for it, he's getting --
TOMMY: Good government.
DODGE: Exactly.   A little access, that's all.
CELIA: (to Guests, smiling) Excuse me.
TOMMY: Look. Whatever you think of me, just promise me one thing.
TOMMY: Come to the Clean Air hearing tomorrow.
CELIA: (baffled) What?
TOMMY: Power and Enterprise.    Noon.
CELIA: But why?
TOMMY: Shouldn't we be heading off, Dick?
DODGE: Let's work the room just a bit more.
REINHARDT (O.S.): Congressman!   Mr. Chairman!
DODGE: Evening, Reinhardt.
DODGE: Well. Look who's over there -- Skeeter Warburton from the EPA. The very man we want to see.
TOMMY: (trying to turn him) Have you tried the oysters, Dick?
DODGE: At a hazardous waste event? (shakes head) I think we'll go talk to him.
TOMMY: No, he's the wrong man --
DODGE: (bemused by Tommy) You don't understand -- he's the perfect man.
TOMMY: But -- but you don't want to bother him with this. Talk to one of his underlings --
DODGE: Nothing beats man-to-man.
TOMMY: Here?     Not here!
DODGE: A public place. What could be better?
TOMMY: But it's the wrong time!
DODGE: While the iron is hot, son.
TOMMY: Shut up, Reinhardt, I'm talking to the Chairman. Beat it, okay?
REINHARDT: (smiling to Dodge) I'll go get him.
TOMMY: (puts hand on abdomen) You heard about this stomach thing going around?
DODGE: Come on, son, we've got the people's business to do.
WARBURTON: Mr. Chairman.    Congressman.
DODGE: I've got a big problem, Skeeter.
WARBURTON: What's that?
DODGE: Your power lines investigation.
WARBURTON: What power lines investigation?
DODGE: We're off the record, Skeeter. This witch-hunt for cancer clusters is bad news for everyone.
WARBURTON: I don't know what you're talking about, Dick.
WARBURTON: No, I'm being straight with you --
DODGE: Then let me be straight with you. You announce this study -- I'm not talking about the results down the road, mind you, I'm just talking about the announcement -- and there's broken crockery everywhere. Real estate. Utilities. Insurance. Schools. Local governments. It'll cost jobs. Uproot families.
WARBURTON: I agree with you completely. There isn't going to be an investigation, old chap, I promise you.
DODGE: (beat) I'm glad we understand each other.
WARBURTON: (beat) Yes, I think we do.
DODGE: And we'll just forget about that phone call this morning?
WARBURTON: We didn't speak on the phone.
DODGE: (vastly impressed) Excellent.
TOMMY: (imitating Warburton) "There isn't going to be an investigation, old chap."
DODGE: (chuckling) You're bad.
DODGE: (sotto voce) Worked like a charm. We scared him shitless. The investigation's dead.
ANDERSEN: Waiter! Champagne! (to Dodge) See you at the Clear Air hearings.
TOMMY: Morning, Reinhardt! Got a minute? I need your advice on something.
REINHARDT: Sure.
VAN DYKE: Is this the assignment desk? Yes, I'm calling from Chairman Dodge's office, on the Hill. We wanted to be sure CNN was sending a crew to the Clean Air hearing today.
ARMANDO (OVERLAPPING): No, not the new emission standards. We're breaking news. This is the biggest thing since Watergate.
LORETTA (OVERLAPPING): This is Cynthia Leeson in the White House Press Office. My boss wanted me to let you folks know -- we're making a major announcement at the Clean Air hearings today. (listens) No, I can't tell you, but it's hot. (listens) Well, if the New York Times wants to be the only paper in town to miss the story of the year, that's up to y'all.
TOMMY: I want to do a little    something nice for Dodge. That     EPA thing -- he's been good to me,    Reinhardt. Is there some way I can,    like, throw a bouquet to him at the    hearing today without having to sit    through that boring testimony    shit?
REINHARDT: Why don't you ask him to give you the floor at the start?
TOMMY: He's do that?
REINHARDT: For some flattery? In a New York minute. Just tip him ahead of time.
TOMMY: Good thinking.
TOMMY: Say, Reinhardt, my Grandma's plane comes in at ten. You wouldn't mind picking her up and driving Miss Daisy around, would you?
REINHARDT: Can't one of the others do it?
TOMMY: No, I don't trust them the way I trust you.
TOMMY: This is it, people.     Game time.   Let's get it right.
ARMANDO: Tell me one thing, jefe. How do you know Andersen is going to bite?
TOMMY: I don't.   You run a con, you run a risk.
WASHINGTON REPORTER #1: You know what this is?
WASHINGTON REPORTER #2: (confidential) It's very hot. Electric cars.
CELIA: I'm cutting out early.
IRA: (indicating TJ) Don't want to run into him?
CELIA: You got that right.
TOMMY: Dick, I thought it might be a nice way to open if I congratulated you on the fine work you been doin' on this committee. Really express our appreciation. Especially on behalf of the minority community.
DODGE: Why, thank you, son.
REINHARDT: Mr. Yancey? Arthur Reinhardt.      Are you testifying for the agency?
GRANDMA: (leaning over) Hello, Homer, dear.
REINHARDT: No, Mrs. Johnson, you must be mistaken -- let me introduce you. This is Mr. Yancey of the EPA.
GRANDMA: (to Reinhardt) Don't be silly, child.
HOMER: Homer Norton. Homer's Pit Stop, Axahatchee, Florida.
GRANDMA: Homer's known Tommy since they were in diapers.
REINHARDT: (getting up) What the -- ?
ARMANDO: Move and you're history.
DODGE: This meeting of the Power and Enterprise Committee to consider the reauthorization of the Clean Air Act is now in session. Today's first business is a panel of national leaders in the field of utilities.
TOMMY: Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the other members of this committee, and on behalf of myself, I have a very personal statement to make. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you -- thank you for your leadership, for your insight, for your boldness...
TOMMY: ... and for your courage. Especially your courage.
DODGE: (surprised) My courage?
TOMMY: Your courage in exposing the corruption that eats away at this institution. Your courage in taking on the special interests. Your courage in taking a major new step --
DODGE: But I've... I've... I've done nothing new, nothing at all -- what are you talking about?
TOMMY: You're    right -- integrity isn't new to you,    Mr. Chairman, it's second nature    to you. Still it's a rare public    servant who'll take on the special    interest money, take on the PACs --
TOMMY (O.S.): take on the lobbyists and fat cats --
TOMMY: Yes, courage, Mr. Chairman, is a quality that you have in abundance --
DODGE: Well, yes, thank you, but we have to move along, if the gentleman would --
TOMMY: (undeterred) Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the Chairman and I had a meeting in his office with Olaf Andersen of Gulf Coast Power, and his lobbyist, Mr. Tommy O'Connor -- (indicating) these gentlemen here. Chairman Dodge and I listened in astonishment as Olaf Andersen offered us seven figures -- that's one million dollars, ladies and gentlemen.
O'CONNOR: Dodge double-crossed us.
ANDERSEN: You're fired.
TOMMY: Isn't that right, Mr. Andersen?
ANDERSEN: That's a vicious lie.
DODGE: Will the gentleman yield?
ANDERSEN: That's not possible! You can't give anyone that kind of money!
TOMMY: Oh, yes, you can. As Mr. O'Connor said to you, quote: "If that's what you want, we can always find a loophole. No one will know." Remember saying that, Tommy?
O'CONNOR: I do not!
DODGE: (standing) I insist that the gentlemen yield!
TOMMY: You can't deny it, Mr. Andersen! We have the whole thing on this tape!
TOMMY: Yesterday, at Chairman Dodge's courageous suggestion, I taped the whole conversation. It's all there. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. The people thank you. America thanks you.
DODGE: I thank the distinguished gentleman. And I thank my fellow citizens. Our methods in this investigation may have been unorthodox, but together -- (indignant, at Andersen) we have exposed a canker at the very heart of democracy.
ANDERSEN: You bastard!    You set me up!
DODGE: Witness is out of order!
ANDERSEN: You stood to make a million bucks off of me! Who offered you more? I want to know!
ANDERSEN: You're as big a whore as he is!
MICKEY: Now?
MARSHALL: Hello?  No. You're joking. (to Man in next bed) You mind if I put on C-span?
ANDERSEN: Don't touch me, you scum!
MICKEY: Now?
ANDERSEN: What about the two hundred k for your phony foundation, Dick? How about the ten thousand copies if your goddam autobiography you muscled me to buy -- what's all that, ancient history?
ANDERSEN: I thought you people were for sale! I was wrong -- you're just for rent!
TOMMY: (acting astonished) Mr. Chairman! You mean to say you did all that stuff? You took all that money?
DODGE: There's nothing I've done that -- (indicating other Members) -- that these gentlemen haven't done!
MEMBERS: No!... Not me!... Just him!... I never!... He crossed the line!
ANDERSEN: They're whores! All of them!
MICKEY: Now?
MICKEY: Throw the bums out!
TJ: Damn straight! Throw the bums out! This place is an outhouse!
VOICES: (calling) Throw the bums out! Throw the bums out!
TOMMY: I owed you one.
DODGE: You lowlife hustler! Who are you to talk? You got into this House through fraud. You think I didn't check up on you?
DODGE: Ladies and   gentlemen, I have here some rather   startling revelations about this   Mr. Johnson before you. This man is   nothing but a con man!
DODGE: A common grifter! (consulting paper) He's wanted in three counties for bunco! He's a convicted swindler!
DODGE (O.S.): A fugitive from justice for card sharping, bookmaking, confidence games --
TOMMY: You know what? He's right!     But let me tell you something --   all that's nothing, compared to   what I pulled here in Washington...   and this shit's all legit!
DODGE: The gentleman is out of order! The gentleman is out of order! This committee is adjourned!
GRANDMA: Stop banging! Stop banging!      That man has something to say!
TOMMY: Adjourned? Fine. Leave. (indicating cameras) Turn your backs on the whole country. That what you want to do, gentlemen?
TOMMY: (to the room) I'm a con man. A small-time con man. Do you know what it was like for me to come to Congress? It was for like dying and going to heaven. If I did back home the kind of scams I've run in Congress, my ass would be in Sing Sing. But no, I'm not a crook -- up here, I'm a distinguished gentleman!

TOMMY: She's right. Throw the bums out -- starting with me! I'm gonna found me a new party. The Don't Vote For Me Party. Any of y'all want to join up?
TOMMY: Well, come on, then! C'mon, get up, we got work to do!
VOICES: Throw the bums out! Throw the bums out!
LORETTA: That Miss Oprah's gonna love his ass.
CELIA: Tommy Johnson. Kamikaze congressman.
CELIA: I can't wait to see that tape you made.
