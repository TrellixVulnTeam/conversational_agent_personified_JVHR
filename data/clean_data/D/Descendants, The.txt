THE DESCENDANTS: Written by
NEUROLOGIST: She reacts non-purposefully to stimuli in a non-specific manner, but occasionally her responses are specific, though inconsistent. Her reflexes are primitive and often the same, regardless of stimuli It was exactly what Elizabeth used to accuse me of.
MATT: Yeah, sure. Put her on.
A SCRAPBOOK: shows PHOTOS OF ELIZABETH lying in her hospital bed. The compositions are odd, the ANGLES uncomfortably CLOSE.
WIDE: Matt confers with fifth-grade teacher MS. Hayashi and school counselor MRS. THULL.
MS. HAYASHI: We just don't think these photographs are appropriate for Scottie to be sharing with her classmates. Some of them went home quite disturbed, and we got some angry calls from parents.
MATT: Yeah, she's sort of been going to town with the whole picture-taking thing, but I had no idea
MS. HAYASHI: I can't tell you how my heart goes out to you and your family, but Scottie just hasn't been herself. Principal Cruz agrees with us that it maybe would be better for Scottie to remain at home with you during this difficult time.
MATT: Home. See, I would think that sticking to her normal routine would be the best thing for her you know, keep her occupied. I wouldn't really know how
MRS. THULL: Mr. King, we see this every day children acting out at school when something's wrong at home. And your family is facing a devastating crisis. Have you been engaging Scottie in really talking about what's going on? Encouraging her to express her feelings? That's crucial.
MATT: ( No ) Oh, yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
MS. HAYASHI: Scottie, that is not a good choice! Are you making a good choice?
MATT: ( realizing ) Yeah, Scottie, come on. Knock it off.
MATT: What's the matter with you? Showing those pictures of Mom for your art I'm a photographer, Dad, a real No, you're not. You're overdoing it is what you're doing.
SCOTTIE: I'm a photographer, Dad, a real No, you're not. You're overdoing it is what you're doing.
MATT: No, you're not. You're overdoing it is what you're doing.
SCOTTIE: I saw it in a book. Some famous photographer lady took pictures of her mom in the hospital while she was dying, and they're considered art. That's what I'm doing.
MATT: First of all, your mother's very sick, but she's not dying. Second, you don't share personal stuff like that with strangers. What's going on with Mom is I'm hungry. Can we get burgers?
SCOTTIE: I'm hungry. Can we get burgers?
MATT: Can we get smoothies?
SCOTTIE: Can we get smoothies?
MATT: As Scottie continues
MATT: I wish you'd stop doing that. And rather than taking her picture all the time, you should talk to her. I'm tired of asking you. You heard Dr. Johnston people in a coma can hear you you know, well, some of them can. It lets them know they're still loved, might even help them wake up sooner. And it'll help you express whatever feelings and emotions you're supposed to be going through you know, make you feel better.
SCOTTIE: I don't know what to say.
MATT: Tell her a story.
SCOTTIE: I don't have a story.
MATT: Tell her anything. Tell her what's been going on in school.
SCOTTIE: She never cares about that.
MATT: I don't believe that. What about after school? She's always driving you around the island. You know, gymnastics? Soccer?
SCOTTIE: I don't do those things anymore.
MATT: Ballet? Piano? Hula?
SCOTTIE: If you're not going to say anything to your mother, we might as well leave.
MATT: If you're not going to say anything to your mother, we might as well leave.
SCOTTIE: Okay. Let's go.
MATT: How about this? Write her a letter.
SCOTTIE: What would I write?
MATT: I don't know. "Get well. Wake up. I love you. Don't leave me alone with my idiot Dad."
SCOTTIE: How's she going to read it? She's in a Goddammit, Scottie, stop fighting me on But it doesn't make any sense.
MATT: Goddammit, Scottie, stop fighting me on But it doesn't make any sense.
SCOTTIE: But it doesn't make any sense.
MATT: You know what your mother is hearing right now? You refusing to talk to her. Is that what you want?
SCOTTIE: I'm starving. And I'm thirsty. I want a soda.
MATT: We're not leaving until you talk to her. I'll even give you privacy. Recite her the alphabet for all I care. What do you want to drink?
SCOTTIE: OK, Sprite. Diet Sprite?
MATT: OK, Sprite. Diet Sprite?
SCOTTIE: Not diet. Regular. Do you think I'm The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
MATT: No, you're not fat.
SCOTTIE: I'm not the model.
MATT: It's just that all that sugar makes you I'm not cranky!
SCOTTIE: I'm not cranky!
MATT: Okay. I'll be right back. Talk.
NURSE JOY: Mr. King, how are you?
MATT: Fine, Joy, fine. And you?
NURSE JOY: I see your picture in the paper today. Have you made your decision yet?
MATT: My decision?
NURSE JOY: Your family. About your big land.
MATT: Well, it's not really my decision. It's my whole family's decision. And . mind your own business, young lady.
SHOPKEEPER: Hey, they all the same cards. You like buy all the same cards?
MATT: These are inappropriate for a hospital gift shop. This girl is underage. Why do you sell postcards like this? This is a hospital. These aren't get-well
SHOPKEEPER: You like buy all the cards? Or you want I put them back?
MATT: ( pulling out his wallet ) Never mind. Yes, I'm buying them. And these two sodas.
SHOPKEEPER: Okay, you buy underage girl all for
MATT: Scottie, what are you doing?
SCOTTIE: I'm hungry. Can we go?
MATT: You didn't talk to her, did you?
SCOTTIE: Yes, I did.
MATT: What did you tell her?
SCOTTIE: It's private.
MATT: You're lying. And Jesus Christ, enough with the goddamn texting! Give me that phone! Give it here!
SCOTTIE: Bye, Mom!
MATT: How can I help you?
MATT: For instance.
MATT: BARB HIGGINS ( O.S. )
MATT: That's not like her at all. She's usually very sweet.
MATT: Yeah, no, I get it. I'm very sorry.
MATT: You need to say you're sorry, and you need to mean it. No dicking around. I have a ton of work to do tonight. Do you have any idea how behind I am? You made her cry. Why would you want to be so mean to someone?
SCOTTIE: ( irritated ) I don't know!
MATT: Is that what you text all the time, nasty things?
SCOTTIE: Well, what then?
MATT: Well, what then?
SCOTTIE: I write them with Reina. They make her laugh, and then she shows Megan and Brooke, and they laugh too.
MATT: I should have known Reina had something to do with it. I don't want you hanging out with her.
SCOTTIE: Wait, I told Reina she could visit me in the hospital since I'm not in school anymore. Can she?
MATT: We'll make a deal. You apologize to this girl, and you talk to your mother, and then we'll see about Reina dropping by the hospital. Okay?
SCOTTIE: Matt looks to see
MATT: Scottie, knock it off!
SCOTTIE: Her house is down there on the corner.
MATT: You've been here before?
SCOTTIE: Yea-uh. She invites me to her birthday, like, every year.
MATT: So you guys are actually friends?
SCOTTIE: Until last year's party, when she locked me out of the house and I had to sit outside all day while everybody was inside. She thought she was so great, but then I became friends with Reina and Brooke and got popular.
MATT: ( processing )
BARB HIGGINS: Thank you for coming by.
BARB HIGGINS: I forgot to mention the time Scottie said she didn't want to be Lani's partner at the rock wall because she didn't want to fall into my daughter's butt crack. That doesn't even make
MATT: Scottie, do you have something you want to say to Lani?
SCOTTIE: ( CONTINUED )
LANI: It's okay.
MATT: Great. Well, nice meeting you both. Lani, you should come over sometime. Come for a swim or a hike or something.
BARB HIGGINS: Scottie, the things you said were simply evil. Do you realize that? I don't know what's led you to be such a nasty young lady.
MATT: Hey, hey. We came over. She apologized. We're dealing with it. Kids are mean sometimes. They grow out of it. It's a kid thing. Here, Scottie, you're going to stop, right? And you're really, really sorry, right?
BARB HIGGINS: I don't think she's sorry at all. She's going to keep doing it. I can No, she won't. It's like the time Lani locked Scottie out of the house at her birthday party and Scottie sat outside by herself. It was a mean thing to do, but Lani here probably did it just to show off, right?
MATT: No, she won't. It's like the time Lani locked Scottie out of the house at her birthday party and Scottie sat outside by herself. It was a mean thing to do, but Lani here probably did it just to show off, right?
BARB HIGGINS: I didn't know about that.
SCOTTIE: You brought me cake.
MATT: You brought her cake. So, I don't know, maybe Lani should be the one to apologize, since this incident may have been the catalyst for all this. "evil" was the word you used.
BARB HIGGINS: Oh, and Mr. King?
MATT: BARB HIGGINS
BARB HIGGINS: Good luck with the sale.
MATT: Big decision.
BARB HIGGINS: My husband's family is from Kaua'i. Hanapepe, born and bred. They hope you don't sell.
MATT: You don't say.
BARB HIGGINS: All the traffic it's going to make.
MATT: Are you going to act different with The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
SCOTTIE: I'll try, but it's hard. She has a face you just want to hit.
MATT: 23 23
NOE: Mr. King, your cousins are here.
LATER: Matt and his cousins stand above the conference table, looking at blueprints and architectural drawings.
DR. JOHNSTON: Bad news, Matt. Dr. Chun, Dr. Mueller and I we believe her condition, which we call a multi-factorial anoxic encephalopathy, is deteriorating. We see no eye movement, no pupillary response, basically no brainstem reflexes whatsoever. The machines could keep her going, but her quality of life would be. very poor. Basically what you see now. She'll never be like she was, Matt. Never. We know that now.
MATT: So. if we do go ahead and take her off the machines
DR. JOHNSTON: Not if, Matt. When. I have a legal obligation. You know that.
MATT: How long will she last?
DR. JOHNSTON: Hard to say. Could be a few days. Could be two weeks. But for planning purposes, you should work off the shortest possible scenario. I know I need to get the ball rolling on organ donations right away.
MATT: What're you doing?
KAI: Oh, she's been looking a little pale lately all cooped up in here, and I just know she'd be mortified if no one had thought to help her out with some lipstick and blush. I know she'll grill me.
MARK: And of course Kai's getting her all caught up on all the latest gossip.
KAI: Well, I don't want to have to start from scratch later. Oh, and Matt, on the way here we stopped by and left some more meals in your fridge, all ready to nuke.
MARK: So what's the latest anyway, Matt? Any No, no. Just more of the same monitoring the swelling, keeping her kidneys and other vitals working, you know, hoping for the best.
MATT: No, no. Just more of the same monitoring the swelling, keeping her kidneys and other vitals working, you know, hoping for the best.
SCOTTIE: ( emerging from the water ) I'm hungry!
MATT: What else is new? Let's get you something to eat.
SCOTTIE: The food here at the club is so good.
MATT: Yeah, they do a good job here.
SCOTTIE: Why is it called a jellyfish? It's not a fish, and it's not jelly.
MATT: No idea. You ask good questions. You're getting too smart for me, I'm going to find out. Then I'm going to ask Mom when she wakes up and see if she knows. Do you think she's going to know everything she used to know?
SCOTTIE: I'm going to find out. Then I'm going to ask Mom when she wakes up and see if she knows. Do you think she's going to know everything she used to know?
TROY: Hi, Matt. Hi, Scottie.
MATT: ( to his friends ) I'll catch up to you guys in a second.
TROY: ( to his friends ) I'll catch up to you guys in a second.
MATT: I visited her last week, you know. I thought she looked pretty good.
TROY: I visited her last week, you know. I thought she looked pretty good.
MATT: So why'd you ask?
TROY: I don't know, I just wanted to know the latest. I'm praying for her every day, you guys. Really hard. Seriously. So what I was saying was, when I was there, I talked to her, and her hand moved, so I was pretty encouraged. I thought that was an encouraging sign.
MATT: That's enough.
TROY: I really think she heard me.
MATT: Look, Troy, go to your friends. No hard feelings. Let's just leave it
TROY: I told you, Matt, there were lots of chops and holes that day. I told you a hundred times. Ask anybody. What happened to her could have happened to me. It was a super-hard day on the You weren't supposed to be driving, Troy. She was supposed to be driving.
MATT: You weren't supposed to be driving, Troy. She was supposed to be driving.
TROY: She wanted me to drive. And she's the one who told me to pass the other boat right before the turn. And just your whole attitude toward me, Matt I mean, I feel terrible. I wish it were me and not her. Plus I almost drowned myself when we capsized. And my rotator cuff is never going to be the same, and I'm going to miss Moloka'i.
SCOTTIE: Just because her hand moved, it doesn't mean anything, Troy. Mom twitches at weird times. When you cut off a chicken's head, it runs all around, but it's still a dead chicken.
MATT: Hey, sport, don't pay any attention to that guy. That guy's a dope.
SCOTTIE: I hate him.
MATT: I didn't mean to say dead chicken. I don't want Mom to die.
SCOTTIE: I didn't mean to say dead chicken. I don't want Mom to die.
MATT: I know, I know. Hey, let's get out of here. Let's go do something crazy. Like let's drive to the airport and hop over to the Big Island and surprise your sister. What do you say?
SCOTTIE: Right now?
MATT: It'll be fun. She's not expecting us or anything. And we bring her home. I think she should be here with us, don't you? Don't you miss her? I miss her.
SCOTTIE: Yeah, I'm out of school. She should be
MATT: Hi, sorry to bother you. I'm Matt Yes, hello, Mr. King.
DORM SUPERVISOR: Yes, hello, Mr. King.
MATT: I've come to pick up my daughter, Did you call Administration?
DORM SUPERVISOR: Did you call Administration?
MATT: No, I didn't. It's sort of an The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
DORM SUPERVISOR: All right, let's see what we can do.
SCOTTIE: Which door? Which door is it?
MATT: Scottie, keep it down!
DORM SUPERVISOR: Will you both keep it down? It's around the corner. That's the wrong door.
MATT: Sorry, Yuki.
DORM SUPERVISOR: Wake your roommate, sweetie.
ROOMMATE: ( glancing in her room ) Um. Alex isn't here.
DORM SUPERVISOR: Where is she?
ROOMMATE: I think she's. outside somewhere.
DORM SUPERVISOR: Girls! What do you think you're doing out here?
EMILY: Hi, Alex! It's me, Scottie!
SCOTTIE: Hi, Alex! It's me, Scottie!
MATT: You know, I pay $25,000 year for this crap not to happen. Alex!
ALEXANDRA: ( laughing, to Emily ) My fucking dad is here!
DORM SUPERVISOR: You don't talk like that here. This is unacceptable behavior!
ALEXANDRA: What's up, Dad?
EMILY: You come out to play a few holes with We came to get you so you can come home. He took me out of school already. I haven't gone for three whole days.
SCOTTIE: We came to get you so you can come home. He took me out of school already. I haven't gone for three whole days.
ALEXANDRA: ( to Matt ) What's happening? Why are you here?
MATT: You need to come home and see Mom.
ALEXANDRA: Fuck Mom!
DORM SUPERVISOR: What did I say about the language?
ON MATT: MATT ( V.O. )
SCOTTIE: I don't like eggs.
MATT: Why didn't you say so before I made I thought they were for you.
SCOTTIE: I thought they were for you.
MATT: Good morning. Does Mom let you have Coke for I'm pretty sure it's after eleven.
ALEXANDRA: I'm pretty sure it's after eleven.
MATT: How are you feeling?
SCOTTIE: I don't mind.
MATT: I thought you were supposed to be getting your act together.
ALEXANDRA: I have gotten my act together. I was just drinking. I've been doing really well, but nobody ever seems to notice my grades are better, and how I was in that stupid play you guys didn't bother to see. Do you even remember the name of it?
MATT: Hey, hey, hey. Watch your language in front of Scottie.
SCOTTIE: I'm okay.
MATT: ( sitting with them ) Anyway, it's good to see you. Welcome home. Want some eggs?
ALEXANDRA: How long do I have to stay?
MATT: We'll discuss that.
ALEXANDRA: ( getting up ) I'm going swimming.
MATT: Then I'll join you.
ALEXANDRA: Good times.
ALEXANDRA: ( into phone ) I gotta go. I'll see you later. ( to Matt ) The pool's really dirty. What day does the pool guy come?
MATT: He comes. you know, I don't know what day he comes.
ALEXANDRA: Matt grabs a POLE to skim the surface of the water.
MATT: Who's Sid?
ALEXANDRA: A really good friend from Punahou. We were in school together for years.
MATT: Oh. Okay.
ALEXANDRA: He wants to be there for me with all this shit happening.
MATT: Do I know his parents?
ALEXANDRA: No. He might stay over too. Is that
SCOTTIE: Ooo, la la! Don't I look divine?
MATT: Scottie, get back inside and change into your swimsuit.
SCOTTIE: Scottie flips him off and runs back inside.
MATT: Scottie flips him off and runs back inside.
ALEXANDRA: Real good job you're doing.
MATT: That's part of why I brought you here. You have to help me. I don't know what to do with her.
ALEXANDRA: Maybe if you spent more time with her, she wouldn't act like such a complete spaz. Get her out of town go camp on Kaua'i. That's what mom did with me whenever I was losing it.
MATT: Listen, Alex, your mother isn't well.
ALEXANDRA: They just told me she isn't going to wake up. It's for sure now. The doctors are going to stop caring for her. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your mom wanted it this way.
MATT: They just told me she isn't going to wake up. It's for sure now. The doctors are going to stop caring for her. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your mom wanted it this way.
UNDERWATER: where she SWIMS, FACE CONTORTED, hoping to stay down there forever. Finally she emerges
ALEXANDRA: Why'd you have to tell me in the goddamned pool?
MATT: Alex. Alex.
ALEXANDRA: What do you want?
MATT: I just found out yesterday. We have to go through this thing together, you and Scottie and I. And I need to go around and tell people what's happening our family and close friends. Sometimes I'll want you to come with me. Other times I need you to watch Scottie.
ALEXANDRA: You want me to go around with you and tell everyone that Mom's going to die? What's the point of that? Breaking the news, watching them cry, dealing with their emotions. How depressing is that going to be? Just call them.
MATT: Alex, nobody wants to do any of this. But we need to tell Grandpa and Tutu, a few friends. They have the right to know and to be able to say goodbye.
ALEXANDRA: I don't want to talk about Mom with Whatever you fought about with her at Christmas, you need to drop it. Grow up. You love your mother. Your mother loves you. Move on.
MATT: Whatever you fought about with her at Christmas, you need to drop it. Grow up. You love your mother. Your mother loves you. Move on.
ALEXANDRA: I can't drop it.
MATT: You have to.
ALEXANDRA: You really don't have a clue, do you? Dad, she was cheating on you. That's what we fought about. When I was home at Christmas, I caught her with some guy. It made me sick to see her near you. I went back to school thinking that was it, I was done with her. I was going to call and tell you everything. But then the accident happened, and I was waiting until she woke up, I guess. And you, you didn't even suspect. Right? That disgusted me too. You're always so busy.
MATT: Caught her with some guy? What does that mean?
ALEXANDRA: Brandy and I were on our way to swim in the Black Point pool, and suddenly I see Mom and some douchebag walk into a house. His house, I guess.
MATT: Just a guy? It could have been He had his hand on her ass. It was You're sure it was her. Then what?
ALEXANDRA: He had his hand on her ass. It was You're sure it was her. Then what?
MATT: You're sure it was her. Then what?
ALEXANDRA: Then nothing. She went into the house. A few days later I told her I knew what she was doing.
MATT: First she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. Like I'm blind. Then she got super-mad and started yelling at me and denied it. That's when I decided I didn't want anything more to do with her.
ALEXANDRA: First she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. Like I'm blind. Then she got super-mad and started yelling at me and denied it. That's when I decided I didn't want anything more to do with her.
MATT: Who is he?
ALEXANDRA: I don't know. Some guy.
MATT: What did he look like?
ALEXANDRA: Dark hair.
MATT: Watch Scottie.
MATT: Hello! It's me, Matt!
KAI: Oh, hey, Matt.
MATT: You guys weren't sleeping, were you?
KAI: No, we were just fighting. Come on in. Want a drink? Want some coffee?
MATT: ( shaking his head ) What were you fighting about?
MARK: It's not stupid. He wants us to throw parties and have people over, which we do, of course, but who ends up doing all the work? Me.
KAI: It's not stupid. He wants us to throw parties and have people over, which we do, of course, but who ends up doing all the work? Me.
MARK: It's work that's totally unnecessary. You don't have to do anything. Nobody's forcing you to clean and buy a new outfit and think of some goddamn theme cocktail. We can just invite people over last minute and drink whatever we have and hang out. It's more fun that way, anyway.
KAI: Shit, Matt. Is Elizabeth is there any news?
MATT: In fact there is. I'll tell you in a moment. Who is he? Does she love him? Who is he?
KAI: I'm sorry to put you in this position. But I'm not really the one who put you there, am I? I just want to know who this guy is that my wife has been. Oh, Matt, you're angry.
MATT: I'm sorry to put you in this position. But I'm not really the one who put you there, am I? I just want to know who this guy is that my wife has been. Oh, Matt, you're angry.
KAI: Oh, Matt, you're angry.
MATT: You could be a therapist. Very keen powers of observation.
KAI: Wow. I think we should talk another time. I think you need to cool it.
MATT: Is it Troy? That fucking Neanderthal?
MARK: You don't know him.
KAI: Oh, don't you even, Mark. Shame on you. You're her friend.
MARK: I'm Matt's friend too. And this is a very unique and dramatic situation. I'd want to know.
KAI: Don't betray her when she can't even defend herself. Matt, you may not be able to hear this right now, but it's not her fault. Women have needs.
MATT: Are you fucking kidding me?
KAI: Your marriage was not. You worked so hard to make partner, and no one can take that away from you. But then you made partner, and you only got busier. And it's not like you were so involved with the girls. She was lonely.
MATT: So you're going to talk to me in clichés about women? Nothing is ever a woman's fault. Was it still going on when she had the accident?
MARK: But I stayed out of it, Matt. Anytime Kai talked about it, I walked away.
MATT: ( to Kai ) And you what? You probably egged her on. Add some drama to your life without any actual risk. Whom do you think you're protecting anyway? She doesn't need your protection it's over. She's going to die.
KAI: Don't say that.
MATT: I almost told you yesterday. She's never going to wake up. It's for sure now. You hear me? We're pulling the plug. You were putting lipstick on a Come on, Matt. That's a little
MARK: Come on, Matt. That's a little
MATT: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to take it out on you guys. I just. Does she love him? The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
KAI: How can you ask about him when she's going to die? Who cares? Yes, she loves him, loved him, whatever. She's crazy about him. She was going to ask you for a divorce.
MATT: You still haven't told me who he is. I guess it doesn't matter.
MARK: Brian Speer. His name is Brian Speer. Two e's.
SCOTTIE: Hi, Daddy.
ALEXANDRA: Dad, this is Sid.
MATT: ( sizing him up ) Hello, Sid.
SID: `Sup, bro?
MATT: Don't ever do that to me again. Get ready, okay? We're going to Grandma and Grandpa's. Auntie Esther will come over to watch Sid's coming with us, okay?
ALEXANDRA: Sid's coming with us, okay?
MATT: Sid, this week, what's going on, is a real family matter. You understand. Sid's not going to be interested in meeting your grandparents. He'll be bored stiff.
ALEXANDRA: Dad, I told you he was going to be with me. I'll be a lot more civil with him What can I say?
SID: ( arms wide, shrugging ) What can I say?
MATT: Does he know what we're doing?
ALEXANDRA: He knows everything.
SID: Dude, your wife is dying and then you find out she's been stepping out on you? That's harsh.
MATT: Get in the car.
SCOTT THORSON: This is like reading Korean.
MATT: Scott, I'll be happy to walk you through it.
SCOTT THORSON: ( tossing the papers ) It's an advanced directive basically her instructions on what medical procedures she wants or, in this case, does not want. No prolonged mechanical ventilation, no
MATT: It's an advanced directive basically her instructions on what medical procedures she wants or, in this case, does not want. No prolonged mechanical ventilation, no
SCOTT THORSON: I know goddamn well what it says. Says she doesn't want everyone waiting around while she spoils like milk. Says if the doctors can't do squat, she'd just as soon get on with it.
ALEXANDRA: Gramps, are you okay?
SCOTT THORSON: Elizabeth had the good sense to write this thing here. Always a thoughtful girl. A strong girl. A hell of a lot stronger than her brother. Barry whines his way through life. Might even be a homosexual, for all I know.
MATT: Yeah, Scott, I don't think so.
SCOTT THORSON: And she's stronger than you, Matt. She lived more in a year than you did in a decade, sitting in your office, hoarding all your cash. All that money you refuse to use what the hell good is it? And now you and your family are cashing in your chips what the hell for? Maybe if you'd let my baby have her own boat and bought her some safe equipment or let her go on those shopping sprees women like, maybe she wouldn't have gone in for those thrill sports. Maybe if you'd provided more thrills at home.
ALEXANDRA: SCOTT THORSON
SCOTT THORSON: And you, Alexandra. Putting your poor mother through hell when all she was trying to do was instill some sense and drive in you. Shame on you. You should try to be more like her. She's a good girl. She's a good girl.
LATER: Scott returns pushing a little DRINK-CART. Behind him trails his wife ALICE. An Alzheimer's victim, Alice is a sweet woman, alert but unable to grasp or recall.
ALICE: Oh, do we have guests?
MATT: ( kissing her ) Hi, Alice. Good to see you. It's me, Good to see you too.
ALICE: Good to see you too.
ALEXANDRA: ( hugging her ) Hi, Tutu.
SCOTT THORSON: That's Alexandra.
ALICE: SCOTT THORSON ( to Sid )
SCOTT THORSON: She's your granddaughter. And this is your son-in-law Matt. This is your family. Well, except this kid. I don't know who the hell he is. Who are you? Why are you here?
ALEXANDRA: He's my friend.
SID: Good afternoon.
SCOTT THORSON: Alice, we're going to go to Queen's Hospital today and see Elizabeth.
ALICE: We are? Queen Elizabeth? That's wonderful. I've never met a queen before. I have to put on a nice dress.
SID: Is she serious?
SCOTT THORSON: You be quiet, son. No, Alice. Our Elizabeth. Our baby. We need to go visit her in the hospital. She needs us, just like when she was a little girl. Let's think about what she might want in her room. We'll take it to her and put it next to her bed.
ALICE: But she's a queen. I have to look good for a queen. Don't you want me to look The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
SCOTT THORSON: Shut up, Alice. Sorry, old gal. You go ahead and say whatever you want.
ALICE: I've never met a queen before. I'm sorry, man. I was just laughing. It's funny. I think she knows she's being funny.
SID: I'm sorry, man. I was just laughing. It's funny. I think she knows she's being funny.
SCOTT THORSON: I'm going to hit you.
MATT: How's the eye?
SID: That was unreal. I mean, how often do old people just haul off and fucking cold-cock you in the face?
MATT: He's hit me a couple times over the years. And watch your language.
ALEXANDRA: Here, let me kiss it.
SID: Hey, could you two just cool it around me? You know, stop. touching each other so much?
MATT: Hey, could you two just cool it around me? You know, stop. touching each other so much?
SID: Whoa! Maybe that's why your wife cheated on you, if you're so against
MATT: You little fuck. Do you get hit a lot?
SID: I don't know. I've had my share.
MATT: ( to Alex ) Your friend is completely retarded. You know that, right?
SID: Hey, my little brother's retarded. Don't use that word in a derogatory
MATT: Psych! I don't have a retarded You suck, Sid.
SID: Psych! I don't have a retarded You suck, Sid.
ALEXANDRA: You suck, Sid.
SID: Speaking of retarded, do you ever feel bad for wishing a retarded person or an old person would just hurry up? Sometimes I wait for them to cross the street, and I'm like, come on already! But then I feel bad.
ALEXANDRA: ( noticing his anguish ) Don't forget I know where he lives.
MATT: Don't forget I know where he lives.
ALEXANDRA: Don't forget I know where he lives.
MATT: Get in the front seat.
ALEXANDRA: Do you know anything about him? Like what he does or if he's married?
MATT: Just his name. Brian Speer.
ALEXANDRA: Why didn't you ask Kai and Mark?
MATT: I just didn't.
ALEXANDRA: Why not?
MATT: I didn't want to get into it.
ALEXANDRA: We'll google him later. Okay, there it is. Stop.
MATT: There? He lives there?
ALEXANDRA: Well, I can't say for sure he lives there. That's just where I saw them.
MATT: And you just happened to be driving by.
ALEXANDRA: Sadie was driving. We both saw it.
SID: That house is a piece of shit. At least go after a guy who's got a mansion. And do you think he's married? That'd be pretty cold-blooded to do it in a house where you're Sid, please be quiet.
ALEXANDRA: Sid, please be quiet.
MATT: What are we going to do?
ALEXANDRA: I don't know. I'm just showing you the
MATT: ( tempted, then ) No, wait, this is stupid this stalking, or whatever the hell we're doing. We came, we saw. Whatever. Let's go.
ALEXANDRA: It's not like we're stalking him
MATT: I guess I just want to see him.
SID: All I know is, someone messed with my girl, all hell would break loose.
ALEXANDRA: Whatever, Sid.
SID: I mean, you'd never do that to me, would you? You know, if we ever got married. Fuck around on me.
ALEXANDRA: Depends on how you treated me.
MATT: That's enough now.
ALEXANDRA: And we're not getting married. Jesus.
MATT: ( starting the car ) Okay, that's enough. We're getting out of here.
ALEXANDRA: Dad, stop!
MATT: Go back.
ALEXANDRA: Go back.
MATT: ( CONTINUED )
ALEXANDRA: Just go back a couple of houses.
MATT: There who is?
ALEXANDRA: Matt and Sid look toward a HOUSE FOR SALE. At first they don't get it, but soon their gaze drifts to the
SID: Must be pretty handy for a dude having an affair to have some empty houses at his fingertips. I'm just saying. That's how I'd do it.
MATT: None of your business. And put some clothes on. And you're not sleeping in Alex's room. In fact, you should really go home, son.
SID: Alex wouldn't like that.
MATT: Guest room. Take it or leave it.
SID: We're going to do what we're going to I'm not going to make it easy for you.
MATT: I'm not going to make it easy for you.
SID: I'm just fooling with you, man. We're not like that. Guest room's awesome. Just call him. He's nobody. Raise
MATT: ( on the BEEP ) Yeah, hi, Brian. My name's, uh, Herb Fitzmorris. I'm interested in that house you've got on Koloa Street, the one with the plantation shutters. I'm at 645-2796. Thanks.
MATT: Let me go in for just a quick moment alone first. I'll be right out.
MATT: You were going to ask me for a divorce? So you could be with some fucking fuckhead Brian Speer? Are you kidding me? Who are you? Because the only thing I know for sure is that you're a goddamned liar. So what do you have to say for yourself? Go ahead, make a little joke and tell me I've got it all wrong. Tell me again I'm too out of touch with my feelings and need to go to therapy. Isn't the idea of marriage to make your partner's way in life a little easier? For me it was always harder with you. And you're still making it harder. Lying there on a ventilator and still fucking up my life. You're relentless. You know what? I was going to ask you for a divorce some day.
SCOTTIE: Hi, Mom! Look who's here.
ALEXANDRA: Hi, Mom.
SCOTTIE: Tell her how you were drunk the other night. Tell her maybe you're an I guess it's in the genes.
ALEXANDRA: I guess it's in the genes.
MATT: Girls, be serious.
ALEXANDRA: Hi, Mom. Sorry for being bad. For wasting your money on expensive private schools. Money you could have used on facials and massages and sports equipment. Sorry for everything. Sorry we weren't good enough for you especially Dad.
MATT: Stop it. That's out of line.
ALEXANDRA: Or what? You going to ground me? Or ship me off to another boarding school? You going to give me a "time out?"
MATT: Unable, in front of Scottie, to remind Alex that Elizabeth is dying, Matt grabs his older daughter and SPANKS her.
SCOTTIE: You got served!
MATT: Scottie, out in the hall.
SCOTTIE: She's the one out of line.
MATT: Go find Sid.
SCOTTIE: He's smoking. I shouldn't be around second-hand smoke.
MATT: ( raising his hand )
ALEXANDRA: Did you just spank me?
MATT: You have no right to talk to your mother that way. She's going to die in a few days. What if those were your last words?
ALEXANDRA: I have every right to speak this way. I'm mad at her. How can you be so
MATT: I'll be angry later. For now let's just think about the good parts.
ALEXANDRA: Look, Mom, I know we fought a lot. But I always wanted to be like you. I am like you. I'm exactly like you. God, that came out so dramatic.
MATT: You are like her. Mostly in good ways. Maybe some bad ways. Remains to be
SID: I hear you got spanked. I hear all hell's breaking loose in here. Hey, Mrs. K., howzit? I'm Sid, Alex's friend from Punahou, remember? Nice day outside. No clouds. Not too hot. You know what I think? Tough lady like you? I think you're going to make it. I mean, I'm no doctor. What do I know? But that's what I think.
SCOTTIE: ( looking at her phone ) Reina just texted me! She's here visiting her grandma! Can she come
MATT: Dammit, Scottie, no Reina.
SCOTTIE: But you said Thursday, and it's almost Thursday. I don't get to see her in school anymore.
MATT: Not now.
SCOTTIE: I need her. Alex needs Sid. I need
LATER: Scottie pushes open the door, now accompanied by her friend REINA, 12, who looks around as if the room is dirty. She wears a terry-cloth tennis skirt and hooded terry-cloth
REINA: Hi, everybody.
SCOTTIE: If you want.
REINA: No, thanks.
MATT: So, Reina, I hear your grandmother's not feeling well.
REINA: Yeah. It's pretty bad. She got her stomach operated on and then got some stupid infection or something. It's pretty gross.
MATT: Well, Reina, thanks for stopping by, and, here, Scottie, let me give you some money, and you two can go get an ice cream or something.
REINA: Too many carbs.
MATT: Carbs. Well, you could go to the cafeteria and get some lettuce.
REINA: That's okay. I'm done. You aren't a liar after all.
SCOTTIE: Don't you want to hang out?
REINA: No, I should go. I'll see you at the club. Hope your mom gets better.
ALEXANDRA: Scottie, what'd she mean by "You aren't a liar after all?" What'd she think you were lying about?
SCOTTIE: She didn't believe Mom was sleeping.
ALEXANDRA: So you had to prove to that twat that Mom's in a coma? What the fuck is in your skull, a bunch of stupid pills?
SCOTTIE: Shut up, you motherless whore!
SID: Whoa, whoa, easy there, half-pipe.
MATT: Where'd you learn how to talk like
ALEXANDRA: Hello? No, you've got the right number. This is his assistant Sharon. How may I help you?
SCOTTIE: Who is it?
ALEXANDRA: Oh, I see. And for how long? Uh-huh. Okay. So one or the other. I'll tell him. Mahalo.
BUZZ: Hi, Mr. King.
MATT: Hello, Buzz.
BUZZ: Sorry about Mrs. King. Hope she gets better real soon.
MATT: It really blows.
BUZZ: It really blows.
MATT: I won't.
BUZZ: Sometimes I steal beers from your outdoor fridge.
MATT: I know.
MATT: .that her coma is permanent. She's not going to make it.
ONE GUEST: Can we see her?
MATT: Yes, for God's sake, yes. That's the whole point. Go see her as soon as possible. That's what I wanted to tell you. It should be now, not after. Everyone who loves her deserves a chance to say goodbye.
ALEXANDRA: You mean him? Tell him to say goodbye?
MATT: I'll only be gone a day or so. I'll leave in the morning, and be back tomorrow night. If it takes another day, fine I'll give it two days tops. If I don't find him, at least I
ALEXANDRA: Drop it, Dad. You've got way bigger fish to fry than confronting fucking Brian Speer. Are you recording this?
MATT: I'm summarizing a deposition.
ALEXANDRA: How can you work?
MATT: How can you go to a movie?
ALEXANDRA: To get Scottie out of the house. And you're going to tell him to come back and see Mom.
MATT: I think. I just think she would want him to know.
ALEXANDRA: Just call his office and say it's an On the phone he can escape. In person he has nowhere to go. I want to see his face. I want to change his life.
MATT: On the phone he can escape. In person he has nowhere to go. I want to see his face. I want to change his life.
ALEXANDRA: Then I want to go too.
MATT: No, you stay with Scottie.
ALEXANDRA: Fuck that. Let's all get out of town.
MATT: Just came over for a day or two.
COUSIN RALPH: Yeah, I just got back from Kahului. A little business over there.
MATT: COUSIN RALPH
COUSIN RALPH: All right. So you here to talk to some of the cousins? Make sure everybody's happy with your choice? Pay your respects to Cousin Hugh?
MATT: No, no, nothing like that. Just a little holoholo. Get the kids out of But it is Holitzer, right? We all know it's Holitzer. Cousin Hugh wants him, they go way back. I got my misgivings, though. It's not the highest bid by a The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
COUSIN RALPH: But it is Holitzer, right? We all know it's Holitzer. Cousin Hugh wants him, they go way back. I got my misgivings, though. It's not the highest bid by a The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft
MATT: Yeah, no, I know. I want to work with you guys, Ralph, I really do. Whatever the majority wants, I'll go along with it. Let's just get it over with.
COUSIN RALPH: How's Elizabeth doing? She going to be The same.
MATT: The same.
COUSIN RALPH: Well, she's a tough gal. She'll be okay. Yeah. Say, where you going, Yeah, Princeville.
MATT: Yeah, Princeville.
COUSIN RALPH: Come on. I'll give you a ride.
MATT: Hey, Ralph.
COUSIN RALPH: Turn off over here. Let's go see the Take a last look, huh?
MATT: Turn off over here. Let's go see the Take a last look, huh?
COUSIN RALPH: Take a last look, huh?
MATT: You got time?
COUSIN RALPH: I got nothing but time.
RALPH: I think this is where a golf course is going to be. They want the golf course to rival Pebble Beach, you know, bring in the big boys.
SID: Are you shitting me? You guys own all this land?
MATT: Not personally. It belongs to a trust. But yeah, it's ours for a few more The other side of that ridge too. You can't see it from here. It's like this, but a little flatter and doesn't have as nice a bay.
RALPH: The other side of that ridge too. You can't see it from here. It's like this, but a little flatter and doesn't have as nice a bay.
SID: This is outrageous.
COUSIN RALPH: ( pointing, to Matt ) Yep. Big resort there on that point. Commercial area over there, houses all through there. I think they should put in a big zip-line. Hell, we should have put in a zip-line.
RALPH: Of course, part of me agrees with the cousins who don't want to sell. They're going to make a pretty big stink at the meeting.
MATT: I know, but we have to sell. The trust has to dissolve in seven years, and if we haven't sold, it'll be a huge mess. Selling now and distributing the cash is the only clean way to do it.
RALPH: But it's a shame, yeah? On the other hand, hey, it's just sitting there. No one's using it. At least this way the whole world will be able to enjoy it.
MATT: ( to his daughters ) Take a good look, girls. In the old days, this was part of your great-great grandmother's inheritance going all the way back to Kamehameha I.
ALEXANDRA: Down there is where Mom and I would We all did, all our lives. A lot of What about me? I want to camp. I wish we lived in the old days.
MATT: We all did, all our lives. A lot of What about me? I want to camp. I wish we lived in the old days.
SCOTTIE: What about me? I want to camp. I wish we lived in the old days.
ALEXANDRA: We do. We still do. Do we really have to sell?
MATT: Doing anything else would get extremely complicated. A lot of your cousins just want the money. Everything has its time.
SCOTTIE: I want us to keep it!
SID: Can you like specify what businesses they'll put here? Because you should totally get a Cheesecake Factory. Only one so far's in Waikiki, and it's awesome. You definitely need a Cheesecake Factory. And Taco John's.
MOMENTS LATER: The Kings approach a nearby MONUMENT commemorating "John Lowell "Keoni" King. 1899 - 1974. The plaque depicts a smiling man atop a horse.
MATT: ( to the girls ) My grandfather. He really loved this place. So did your mother. So does your mother.
CLERK: Here's your credit card back, Mr. King. And how many keycards will you be needing today for your deluxe suite?
MATT: Let's say three. By the way. I'm supposed to meet a buddy of mine I think is staying here. Brian Speer. S-
CLERK: ( checking computer ) I'm not showing anyone by that name.
MATT: 92 INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY 92
LATER: Matt is on the telephone, nodding gravely.
MATT: No, I understand. Okay. Thanks.
MATT: Put that out, will you please?
ALEXANDRA: I could.
MATT: Just got off the phone with Dr. Johnston. They did what they had to do a couple hours ago. They've moved her to another floor. They say she seems comfortable, still breathing on her own. She's doing okay.
ALEXANDRA: What do you mean? You mean considering Mom's. circling the drain?
MATT: No, I mean other than that. In general. You haven't been using, have No, Jesus, I'm not using.
ALEXANDRA: No, Jesus, I'm not using.
MATT: Not at all? I smell pot all the time on Sid.
ALEXANDRA: That's Sid.
MATT: So you just stopped? Really?
ALEXANDRA: Look, Dad, it's no big deal. Kids do drugs and they stop. Unless they're like super-ghetto. And you sent me to boarding school, remember? I couldn't get anything anymore. So no, I'm not doing any drugs. But I still think they're fun. Okay, maybe a little pot once in a while.
MATT: And a little drinking.
ALEXANDRA: Mom's dying.
MATT: Yeah, well, I'm proud of you.
ALEXANDRA: Not much to be proud of.
MATT: Yeah, there is. We shipped you off. Let them handle it. And now you're here, helping with Scottie, helping me. You want to know what really pisses me off? That she wouldn't end it. Not even when she knew she was busted. How are we supposed to feel about that?
ALEXANDRA: You want to know what really pisses me off? That she wouldn't end it. Not even when she knew she was busted. How are we supposed to feel about that?
MATT: I guess she really liked him.
ALEXANDRA: So how are we going to find this guy, Right. Well, why don't you two take Scottie to the beach? I'm going to call around a little. We're on an island, for Christ's sake. Everything's just one degree of We'll find him.
MATT: Right. Well, why don't you two take Scottie to the beach? I'm going to call around a little. We're on an island, for Christ's sake. Everything's just one degree of We'll find him.
ALEXANDRA: ( getting up ) We'll find him.
MATT: Hey, what's in your suit?
SCOTTIE: They're my beach boobs.
MATT: Take that out. Right now. Alex, Jesus, why'd you let her do that? You too, Sid.
ALEXANDRA: I don't know. Take them out, stupid.
SID: Yeah, Scottie. Honestly. Big boobs look kind of fatty.
ALEXANDRA: Any luck?
MATT: The hotels were a dead end, but I took another shot with his office. He's definitely in Hanalei renting a house somewhere probably one of those cottages around the bay. Who wants to go for a walk?
SID: Sounds good.
ALEXANDRA: Yeah, let's go. Scottie!
SCOTTIE: ( catching up to Matt ) Can we swim with the sharks? I read in the hotel magazine how they put you in a cage in the ocean and throw shark feed in the water and sharks swim right up to you. Can we do that?
ALEXANDRA: Scottie, we're not really here to do stuff like that.
SCOTTIE: How'd you and Mom meet?
MATT: I was with a law school buddy from the mainland, and I took him to the club. We were just coming in from paddling, and your mom was on her way out, and she looked at me and said, "Do you think it's going to snow today?" We all got beers when she came back in. I had already seen her around. That was it. I got her number.
SCOTTIE: Did you think she was pretty?
MATT: She knocked me out.
SCOTTIE: What do you love about her?
MATT: I love. I don't know. The way we are with each other, most of the time, anyway. I love how she's more capable of feeling joy than anyone I've ever known. I just like being with her, just riding bikes or going out to dinner, even if it's just a plate lunch at Rainbow's. Years ago we used to do a lot of paddling together.
ALEXANDRA: Can we drop this? Jesus. "What do you love about Mom, Daddy?" Shut up, already. And stop babying her.
MATT: Easy, Alex. We're just talking.
MATT: Your mom got chased by a shark once. Very close call.
ALEXANDRA: When was that?
MATT: We were on Moloka'i with Mark and Kai, and your mom was out surfing and saw a shark right beneath her on a wave. Like right beneath her. She got down on her stomach and started paddling like crazy, and this big fin kept following her. She even paddled up onto the nearest rocks instead of all the way to shore. Got cuts all over her legs and hands. Only time I ever saw your mother scared, and she was really scared. She even threw up. Crying and shaking. I had to hold her for a long time. She really thought she was going to die. Of course she hid all that from the Mitchells, turned it into a funny "Me-versus-a-shark" story. I told her.
ALEXANDRA: I told her it wasn't her time yet.
MATT: I told her it wasn't her time yet.
SCOTTIE: I wish Mom was here.
MATT: I'll ask you that same question, Scottie. What do you love about Mom?
SCOTTIE: Lots of stuff. She's not old and ugly like other moms.
ALEXANDRA: Why are we still talking about this? I like how she's not afraid of
SCOTTIE: Let's watch one of these!
ALEXANDRA: We're not watching porn.
SCOTTIE: Reina's dad watches pornos. Reina calls them masturbation movies. Her dad has some. She plays them when her parents aren't home and one time invited boys over to see if they grew down there. One did.
SID: Reina's awesome.
MATT: Were you there? Have you seen any of those movies?
SCOTTIE: You've got to watch her with the internet. And Reina's dad. Scottie, Reina is a fucked-up ho-bag, and you need to stay away from her. Do you want to end up like me?
ALEXANDRA: You've got to watch her with the internet. And Reina's dad. Scottie, Reina is a fucked-up ho-bag, and you need to stay away from her. Do you want to end up like me?
SCOTTIE: ( CONTINUED )
ALEXANDRA: I mean the earlier me, when I was mean to you and yelling at mom all the time.
SCOTTIE: Well, Reina's going to be a meth-head, and she's going to get used by stupid guys. She's a twat. Say it.
ALEXANDRA: Well, Reina's going to be a meth-head, and she's going to get used by stupid guys. She's a twat. Say it.
SCOTTIE: She's a twat. Twat, twat, twat, twat!
MATT: Stop that! I don't get it. I don't know what to do. these things she does. What goes on in her head? You weren't like that.
ALEXANDRA: It'll go away.
MATT: I'm not so sure. I mean, look how you kids talk in front of me. It's like you don't respect authority.
MOMENTS LATER: Exiting the bathroom, he decides he should make a routine inspection and wanders into
SID: Hey, what's up?
MATT: ( CONTINUED )
SID: Checking on me or something?
MATT: I don't, uh. I haven't been sleeping very much lately.
SID: I'm worried about my daughters. I'm worried there's something wrong with I used to do some messed-up shit when I was a kid. Still do. It's going to get worse after your wife dies.
MATT: I'm worried about my daughters. I'm worried there's something wrong with I used to do some messed-up shit when I was a kid. Still do. It's going to get worse after your wife dies.
SID: I used to do some messed-up shit when I was a kid. Still do. It's going to get worse after your wife dies.
MATT: What does Alex really think about this stuff that's going on? What does she She doesn't.
SID: She doesn't.
MATT: What do you mean? I thought she talks to you all the time.
SID: We don't really talk about our like "issues." We just, I don't know, we deal with our shit by talking about other stuff and having a good time.
MATT: What would you do if you were me? How would you handle my daughters? How would you handle. the situation of this guy we're trying to find?
SID: I told you what I'd do I'd lay his nuts on a dresser and hit `em with a spiked bat. With the daughters, I don't know. I'd take them on a trip. Or no, I'd buy `em a bunch of shit. Like with all the money you're going to get when you sell the land you're going to make stupid money, right? dude, you could buy them anything.
MATT: Do you want some of it? Some money?
SID: If I gave you a lot of money right now, tonight, would you leave?
MATT: If I gave you a lot of money right now, tonight, would you leave?
SID: Why would I leave?
MATT: No, Sid, I'm asking you a favor. If I give you money, will you leave?
SID: Oh. I get it. Is that what you want? You want me to go?
MATT: I guess not.
SID: Look, dude, you're right. If I had daughters, I wouldn't know what to do. Exchange them for sons, I guess.
MATT: Then I might wind up with something like you.
SID: I'm not so bad. I'm smart.
MATT: You're about a hundred miles away from Smartville. No offense.
SID: You're mistaken, counselor. I'm smart. I have good hygiene. I'm an decent guitarist, a good cook. I cook food all the time. I'm vice-president of the Punahou chess club. And I always have weed.
MATT: I'm sure your parents are proud.
SID: It's possible. My mom's sort of busy right now.
MATT: What does she do, your mom?
SID: She's a receptionist at a pet clinic. But mostly she's been getting the house together after my dad died. My dad died a few months ago.
MATT: Goodnight, Sid. I'll see you tomorrow.
SID: Goodnight, boss.
BRIAN SPEER!: They pass each other. Matt continues on a moment in disbelief, then TURNS AROUND and follows. His strides long and efficient, Brian gives Matt a run for his money.
MATT: ( under his breath ) Hi, you don't know me, but I know you. Hi, you don't know me, but I know you. Brian Speer, right? Hi, I'm Liz's husband. That's right. Fuckface.

MATT: She'll be fine.
JULIE: What's wrong? If you don't mind my Just a little boating accident. Hit her head a little too hard.
MATT: Just a little boating accident. Hit her head a little too hard.
JULIE: A sailboat? Or one with a motor?
MATT: ( laughs, then ) One with a motor.
JULIE: Well, good luck with that. I wish her well. Skylar, don't go so far!
MATT: You guys staying in one of the cottages over there?
JULIE: Yes, my husband had to come here for work, so we thought we'd all make a little vacation of it. He knows the owner, so

JULIE: You too. Take care.
COUSIN HUGH: yucking it up at the BAR with other REGULARS.
MATT: ( to Alexandra ) There's Cousin Hugh. Get us a table. Order me something.
ALEXANDRA: Like what?
MATT: AT THE BAR Matt wedges his way in beside his third cousin, who despite his booziness and very local flavor is nonetheless a King family patriarch.
COUSIN HUGH: Heeey! Mattie-boy! What are you doing here? I didn't expect to see you until the meeting.

COUSIN HUGH: Big girls now! So what are you doing here, man?

COUSIN HUGH: Barney, an old-fashioned for my cousin here. Nice to see you, Matt. How you been otherwise?
MATT: Not much otherwise. Between our business and the hospital, you know, I've just trying to keep my head above water. So listen, I see you have some people staying in the cottage.
COUSIN HUGH: Oh, hey, Mattie, if I'd known you were coming, I coulda
MATT: No, no, no, I'm just wondering about the guy you're renting to. I think his name is Brian Speer.
COUSIN HUGH: Yeah, yeah, real determined son-of-a- bitch. He's Lou's sister's. No, wait. Lou has a sister, and the sister's husband. Lou's brother-in- law is cousins with that guy.
MATT: Huh? Who's Lou?
COUSIN HUGH: No, wait. You mean the cottages on the bay or the cottage back by the trail?
MATT: The bay. The guy with the wife and two
COUSIN HUGH: Yeah, that's right. Determined son-of- a-bitch. Anyway, the point is the guy we're doing business with is that guy's brother-in-law. Works for him.
MATT: Brian Speer.
COUSIN HUGH: That's the guy.
MATT: What do you mean, the guy we're doing business with?
COUSIN HUGH: Who do you think? Don Holitzer.
MATT: COUSIN HUGH
COUSIN HUGH: That's what I'm saying. That's Don's brother-in-law in the cottage. You don't know him? I would have thought you'd know him. He's a realtor over by you. So if we sell to Don and that's what we're going to do, right? That's what you want too. Nice guy, Don. He'll do right by us. Then when Don develops and re-sells and leases and all that
MATT: Yeah, yeah
COUSIN HUGH: He's letting this brother-in-law in the cottage handle the transactions. A lot of them, anyway. Big score for that
MATT: What's he like?
COUSIN HUGH: ( CONTINUED )
MATT: Brian Speer what else do you know about him?
COUSIN HUGH: Not much. He's lucky. The bugga's lucky. His sister is married to the guy. Son-of-a-bitch is going to make a shitload of money on commissions.
MATT: Not if we don't go with that bid.
COUSIN HUGH: We all want Don. You do too, Matt. You've said as much.
MATT: No, I know. You're right. Okay. Well. Good to see you, Hugh.
COUSIN HUGH: You too.
MATT: See you at the meeting.
COUSIN HUGH: I'll be there.
SID: This place rocks.
SCOTTIE: We ordered you mahi.
ALEXANDRA: We ordered you mahi.
MATT: ( low )
MATT: So, guess what. Turns out Brian Speer is connected to Don Holitzer.
ALEXANDRA: Who's Don Holitzer?
MATT: The guy we're going to sell to. And that woman today at the beach. That was his wife.
ALEXANDRA: Whose wife? The hottie with the hat? You sure? So he's married. Nice. Why didn't you say anything?
MATT: It's him I want to talk to, not her. I know where their cottage is.
ALEXANDRA: You do? So let's do it right now. Let's go knock on his door.
MATT: That's what I'm saying.
ALEXANDRA: Well, it's what we came here to do.
MATT: So you to talk to his wife while I talk to him. And figure out some way to distract Scottie and their kids.
ALEXANDRA: Got it. Sid, come here!
ALEXANDRA: Listen, Dad and I are going to go talk to some friends while Sid takes you back to the hotel, okay?
SCOTTIE: I want to come too.
SID: I don't. Who wants to sit around talking in some house? Let's ditch these losers and go watch some serious
SCOTTIE: As they walk away
SID: ( to Matt, low ) Give `em hell, boss.
ALEXANDRA: Are you ready?
MATT: No. What should I say?
ALEXANDRA: You'll think of something. You're a I'm sorry for sucking you into this. I should be doing this alone. It's selfish of me.
MATT: I'm sorry for sucking you into this. I should be doing this alone. It's selfish of me.
ALEXANDRA: I'm the one who sucked you in. I'm the one who knew.
MATT: ( stiffly ) Hi there!
JULIE: Oh, hello.
MATT: Yeah, hey, I'm such an idiot. I just figured out I do know your husband. My daughter and I were on our way back to the hotel from dinner, and we thought we'd drop by and say howdy.
ALEXANDRA: ( mouthing ) Great. Come on up.
JULIE: Great. Come on up.
MATT: I'm Matt King. This is Alexandra.
JULIE: I'm Julie Speer. Yeah, I thought that was you.
MATT: Yeah, no, I know, yeah, super-involved. Maybe I've met him in passing. I don't So, I guess you guys are deciding really soon. A couple of days, right you and your family meet? I'm sorry. That's probably a conflict of interest or something.
JULIE: So, I guess you guys are deciding really soon. A couple of days, right you and your family meet? I'm sorry. That's probably a conflict of interest or something.
MATT: No, it's okay. You're right it'll all be over in a couple of days.
JULIE: You guys want a burger?
MATT: We just ate, thanks.
JULIE: A drink then.
BRIAN SPEER: Hi, I'm Brian.
MATT: Brian, we may have met before. Matt King. My wife is Elizabeth King. I think you may have met her too. Our daughter Alexandra.
JULIE: I was just going to get drinks.
BRIAN SPEER: Good, good. Good.
ALEXANDRA: Do you need help?
JULIE: ( over her shoulder ) No, no, I got it.
MATT: Elizabeth is dying. Oh, wait. Fuck you. And she's dying. We unhooked her from the machines this morning. She'll be dead in a few days.
ALEXANDRA: We're not here to hurt you. We just thought she'd want you to know.
MATT: Beats me. Well, he's very articulate.
BRIAN SPEER: I can't. I'm sorry. I never thought it would come to this.
ALEXANDRA: You're sorry my mom's going to die? You're sorry you fucked her? You're sorry you fucked over my dad?
BRIAN SPEER: I'm sorry for all of it.
MATT: Look, pal, like she said, I'm not here to wreck your life. I just came to give you a chance to go to the hospital. I don't know how long you're planning on being here, but I'm sure you can think of an excuse to leave.
ALEXANDRA: You must be good at that.
MATT: You can be alone with her to say goodbye or whatever you want. Do you hear what I'm saying?
BRIAN SPEER: Okay, look, I can't have you here. You
JULIE: Here we go. Everyone's so serious. Please don't tell me you're talking about business.
ALEXANDRA: We're talking about love.
JULIE: That's nice. Brian, call the boys in for dinner.
BRIAN SPEER: They're fine. Let them play a while
ALEXANDRA: Awesome cottage you're renting.
MATT: Yeah, say, prime Hanalei location. I used to come here as a kid before it was a vacation rental. Alex, your great-uncle Warren and Aunt Lillian built it back in the 20s. Haven't been inside in years.
JULIE: Come on. We'll give you a tour.
ALEXANDRA: Or, Brian, maybe you could give my dad a little walk down memory lane, and Julie and I can chat out here.
MATT: Yeah, I'd like that, if you don't mind. Just a quick look.
BRIAN SPEER: Sure. But it's not like I live here.
BRIAN SPEER: Here it is.
MATT: How did you meet? I'm curious.
BRIAN SPEER: I can't do this.
MATT: Neither can I. How did you meet?
BRIAN SPEER: I thought you said you came here just to tell me.
MATT: I changed my mind. And I can't very well ask her the details. How'd you At a party.
BRIAN SPEER: At a party.
MATT: What party?
BRIAN SPEER: Super Bowl party.
MATT: ( figuring it out ) At the Mitchells'.
BRIAN SPEER: Does that help? Does that make it
MATT: Hey, I'm doing you a favor here. I could go out there right now and fuck you up, so get a better attitude. Then what? How'd you get the nerve to ask her out?
BRIAN SPEER: No, no. It's not what you think. It just happened.
MATT: Nothing just happens.
BRIAN SPEER: Everything just happens.
MATT: Was she going to leave me?
BRIAN SPEER: She would have. But I, I, uh. I didn't want that. That wouldn't have happened. I love Julie. Please don't tell her. Please. I don't know what I've done. I'm sorry.
MATT: Did she say she loved you?
BRIAN SPEER: No, I told you. I wasn't trying to get to you.
MATT: Then I guess it's all working out. Her lips are sealed, and you don't have to go through the trouble of dumping her.
BRIAN SPEER: Hey, hey, that's really unfair. I had - - have a lot of respect for her. She's a wonderful woman.
MATT: Too bad her husband found out. You can't win `em all. One more question. Have you ever been inside my bedroom?
BRIAN SPEER: ( tortured ) You could have had the decency to lie about that one. Well, she's in Queen's Hospital if you want to say goodbye. That really is all I came to say.
MATT: You could have had the decency to lie about that one. Well, she's in Queen's Hospital if you want to say goodbye. That really is all I came to say.
BRIAN SPEER: Shouldn't you be with her?
MATT: Yeah, great, all remodeled, new appliances. Nice. Alex, we should be getting back.
JULIE: Well, hey, thanks for stopping by. Really nice to meet you both. Maybe we'll see you at the beach tomorrow.
ALEXANDRA: Yeah, maybe.
ALEXANDRA: So when do you think he'll show up?
MATT: I have no idea.
SID: Was he sorry? I hope he was sorry, man. You could have told his wife, and you didn't. I hope he knows how lucky he is. I would have told her everything. She deserves to know. Or else she's going to be a dumb bitch the rest of her life.
ALEXANDRA: I'm just saying.
SID: I'm just saying.
MATT: No need to get creepy. Anyway, doesn't matter. That's all behind us.
ALEXANDRA: Yeah, the one we have to worry about telling things to now is Scottie.
MATT: I've asked Dr. Johnston to help us break the news tomorrow.
DR. JOHNSTON: Hello, everyone. Matt. This is Dr. Herman, whom I told you about. She works with us in Hello, everyone. Hello. Hi. Hello.
DR. HERMAN: ( locking eyes with all ) Hello, everyone. Hello. Hi. Hello.
SCOTTIE: How come Mom isn't on any more machines? Is she getting better?
DR. HERMAN: You must be Scottie. Scottie, I have a present for you.
SCOTTIE: Like what?
DR. HERMAN: I've heard that you're a wonderful and unique and spirited girl.
SCOTTIE: Dad, is that true?
MATT: Yes, Scottie. It's true.
DR. HERMAN: You're going to have to be a very brave girl right now, and you're surrounded by people who love you. I came to meet you and tell you that if you ever want to talk about what you're feeling, I would like to talk to you too. I can help you face what's going on without all the silly defense mechanisms that work for an octopus but not for us.
DR. JOHNSTON: Okay. Thank you, Dr. Herman.
ALEXANDRA: What the fuck was that?
DR. JOHNSTON: Yes, well, they say she's very good one- So Mom's going to die for sure?
SCOTTIE: So Mom's going to die for sure?
DR. JOHNSTON: Yes. We worked really hard with her, but three other doctors and I agree she's in what we call an irreversible coma. Do you know what that means?
SCOTTIE: It means she doesn't have a brain Not exactly, but. yes, that's the general idea. So we're doing exactly what she wanted us to do if that ever happened. That's why she's not attached to the machines anymore.
DR. JOHNSTON: Not exactly, but. yes, that's the general idea. So we're doing exactly what she wanted us to do if that ever happened. That's why she's not attached to the machines anymore.
ALEXANDRA: It's for the best, Scottie. Look at her. She's not happy like this.
DR. JOHNSTON: The purpose of medicine is to heal, and we can't do that now.
MATT: Do you understand?
SCOTTIE: Yes. What will we do with her body?
MATT: First Mom's going to give some of her organs to other sick people, so she can help save their lives. That's a really neat thing she's doing. Then we're going to. we're going to scatter her ashes in the ocean. You know how Mom always loved the ocean.
SCOTTIE: Her ashes?
DR. JOHNSTON: Any day now, I'm afraid. But you still have some time.
MATT: Thanks, Sam.
ALEXANDRA: Come here, Scottie.
SCOTTIE: Do eyeballs burn?
SID: Hey, Scottie. Don't think about stuff like that.
SCOTT THORSON: Here we are. Hi, Bingo. Alex.
MATT: There's not much left to decide. We're just sort of playing it by ear and making sure she's comfortable.
SCOTT THORSON: I mean what did you decide about the buyer? Who's your buyer?
BARRY THORSON: Dad, I'm sure you'll be able to read about it in the paper.
SCOTT THORSON: I don't need to read about it. I can hear about it right now.
MATT: Scott, let's not talk about that here. It's not the time for that.
SCOTT THORSON: All the same to you, I guess. A million here, a million there. Just ironic, that's all Elizabeth coming into this misfortune just as you're coming into a fortune. She gave you everything, Matt. A good, happy home, two beautiful daughters.
MATT: Scott, what's your point?
SCOTT THORSON: She wanted her own boat. She should have had her own boat, one she would have been familiar with.
MATT: She wasn't even driving! Her boat, someone else's boat it wouldn't have made any difference. You're not going to blame me for this.
SCOTT THORSON: Sure, sure, quibble about the details. She was a faithful, devoted wife. She deserved more.
MATT: You're right. She deserved more.
SID: For Christ's sake, take it easy on the

ALICE: Are we ready to go?
BARRY THORSON: No, Mom. Not yet.
MATT: ( gesturing toward the door ) Girls, Sid.
SID: Man, that guy's a prick. Was he always like that?
MATT: Scottie has stayed behind to peek through a crack in the door. Noticing, the others join her.
SID: Is he praying?
MATT: SCOTT THORSON ( opening his eyes )
SCOTT THORSON: ( opening his eyes ) Say goodbye to Elizabeth, Alice.
ALICE: Oh. Goodbye, Elizabeth.
WIDE: Matt and his daughters watch without moving.
WIDER: Matt alone.
DISSOLVE TO: 122 EXT. KING FAMILY SHARED PROPERTY HOUSE - LATER 122
CLOSER: Amid drinks held aloft, a CALABASH is passed among the cousins into which the each places a folded BALLOT. Matt sits watching the proceedings with Cousin Hugh, Cousin Six and another ELDERLY COUSIN at a table piled with papers and contracts.
MATT: Elizabeth's not doing well.
COUSIN HUGH: She'll be okay. She's a fighter.
MATT: No. She's dying. We took her off the
LATER: Matt, Hugh and Six FINISH THE COUNT while others mill about, mingle, drink an early celebration for all except for a group of DISSENTERS off to one side.
COUSIN HUGH: Well, no surprise. Other than the holdouts who don't want to sell at all, it's Don Holitzer. Chicago group a distant second. Feels good. We're doing the right thing, Mattie. At least there ain't going to be any Wal-Mart. Now it's your call, and we're all behind you, most of us Go ahead, Captain. Make it official.
MATT: It's strange, that's all.
COUSIN HUGH: What's strange?
MATT: We didn't do anything to own that land. It was entrusted to us. And now we're
COUSIN HUGH: What're you doing, Matt? I mean, we know you have a lot on your plate right now, but you're not going to fuck this up for us. It's over. If we don't sell now, it'll be a mess when the trust dissolves. Just sign, go to your wife, done.
MATT: I don't want it to go to Holitzer. I don't want it to go to anyone. I want to keep it.
COUSIN SIX: For Christ's sake. We can't move without your approval. And we don't want to.
COUSIN HUGH: Your head's not right, Mattie. Your head's not right. You want a couple days to think it over? Take a couple I don't need a couple days. I have the authority, and this is what I want. I haven't wanted something in a long time. We have other businesses we're converting to corporations. We can figure it out.
MATT: I don't need a couple days. I have the authority, and this is what I want. I haven't wanted something in a long time. We have other businesses we're converting to corporations. We can figure it out.
COUSIN SIX: But it's utterly unproductive land. It doesn't generate enough income to pay the goddamn taxes.
COUSIN HUGH: You're the trustee. You know better than anyone we only have seven years Then I have seven years to figure out how to keep it.
MATT: Then I have seven years to figure out how to keep it.
COUSIN HUGH: We'll come after you. Just because you're a lawyer doesn't mean the rest of us would be afraid to come after you. But nobody wants to do that. We're family.
MATT: People will be relieved, Hugh, the whole state. I sign that document, it's over. End of the line. Something that was ours to protect will be gone. Even though we're haole as shit and go to private schools and clubs and can't even speak pidgin, let alone Hawaiian, we still carry Hawaiian blood, and we're still tied to this land. And our children are tied to this land. It's a miracle that for whatever bullshit reason 150 years ago, we own this much of. paradise, but we do. And for whatever bullshit reason now, I'm the trustee. And I'm not signing. And if you sue me, it'll only make us closer.
COUSIN HUGH: All right, everybody, listen up. Cousin Mattie has an announcement. Get
MATT: Julie. What are you doing here?
JULIE: I know we just met, but I was thinking about you guys these past few days, and I knew your mom was here. I don't know. I just felt I should stop by.
MATT: You remember Alex. This is Scottie. Sid. This is Mrs. Speer.
JULIE: Were you friends with my mom?
SCOTTIE: Were you friends with my mom?
JULIE: No, we never met. But I know a lot about her.
MATT: Well, we appreciate your coming by. The flowers are lovely.
SID: ( heading to the door ) Scottie, Alex. Let's go to the
MATT: I, uh, I'm not sure how much you know about my wife's condition, but she's going to die very soon. Any minute, really. That's sort of why we're all I know. That's why I came. Because I know. I came because my husband wouldn't. And that just didn't seem right. I thought someone from my family should come. I'm sorry I came to your house like that. Just barged in on you.
JULIE: I know. That's why I came. Because I know. I came because my husband wouldn't. And that just didn't seem right. I thought someone from my family should come. I'm sorry I came to your house like that. Just barged in on you.
MATT: I'm sorry I came to your house like that. Just barged in on you.
JULIE: It's all right. I assume you're angry. Of course you are. I'm angry too.
MATT: So he told you, huh?
JULIE: After you left that night, he was acting really weird. Then I started smelling it all over him. I'd already smelled it.
MATT: You're a woman.
JULIE: I finally got it out of him. We've been going crazy ever since. Not easy with the kids around. It's all something I never could have imagined. And then your family's decision about the land. I think you're doing the right thing, but Brian is well, it's all so complicated and confusing.
MATT: I know.
JULIE: Brian told me everything. Well, how can I ever know it's everything? When did you find out? Have you known for a Just a few days ago.
MATT: Just a few days ago.
JULIE: I'm angry, but I'm just so sorry. I can't imagine what you're going through. Do you mind if I say something to her? Elizabeth, I'm Julie. Brian's wife. I just want to say I forgive you. I forgive you for trying to take Brian. I forgive you for almost destroying my family. I have to forgive you. Even though I want to hate you.
MATT: Okay. All right. That's enough, Julie. I think. I think that's
JULIE: That's why I'm here.
MATT: Goodbye, Elizabeth. Goodbye, my love, my friend, my pain, my joy. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
PADDLES: in the water.
SCOTTIE: How far do we have to go?
MATT: Not that far. Just past the break.
ALEXANDRA: Steer straighter, Dad. And a little faster, okay?
MATT: I'm trying.
MATT: Well, here we are, just the four of us. For the last time. Alex, why don't you start? Scottie, hand her the box.
THE ASHES: fall densely in one spot, then slowly darken the water and Alex looks down, struck by the weirdness of it all, before glancing up at Matt.
SCOTTIE: What should I say?
ALEXANDRA: Just say goodbye.
MATT: Come on, Scottie. It's okay.
SCOTTIE: ( finally ) Bye, Mom.
MATT: All right, Scottie, here. Pass that to me. Good job.
MATT: One scoop strawberry, one scoop mocha
SCOTTIE: Matt gets under the quilt with her. Moments later Alexandra wanders in, notices what they're watching, sits next to Matt, pulls the quilt over her legs.
ALEXANDRA: Can I have some?
