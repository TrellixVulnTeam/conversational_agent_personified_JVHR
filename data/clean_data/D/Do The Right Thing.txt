WGA #45816: "The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America is that the black man in white Christian hands has not grown violent. It is a miracle that 22 million black people have not risen up against their oppressorsin which they would have been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the democratic tradition! It is a miracle that a nation of black people has so fervently continued to believe in a turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die philosophy! It is a miracle that the American Black people have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the centuries of hell that they have caught, here in white man's heaven! The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro 'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with degrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black masses quiet until now."

PINO: Who's working for who? There's a knock on the door and Da Mayor enters.
SAL: Come on in, Mayor.
DA MAYOR: Good morning, gentlemens. It's gonna be a scorcher today, that's for sure. Need any work done around here? Sal looks at Pino, who reluctantly gives Da Mayor the broom.
DA MAYOR: It will be the cleanest sidewalk in Brooklyn. Clean as the Board of Da Mayor almost runs out of the pizzeria in his hurry; soon as he finishes he'll be able to get a bottle.

ELLA: Heard that, Punchy. Ahmad sits down with them.
AHMAD: Ella, you have a brain, use it. In the BG, we hear the dum-dum-dum of a giant box. The sound gets louder as the box gets closer. The youths look down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them. He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop. This is RADIO RAHEEM. The size of his box is tremendous and one has to think, how does he carry something that big around with him? It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk shakes as the rap music blares out. The song we hear is the only one Radio Raheem plays.
RADIO RAHEEM: Peace, y'all.
ELLA: Peace, Radio Raheem.
CEE: You the man, Radio Raheem.

MOTHER SISTER: You ole drunk. What did I tell ya about drinking in front of my stoop? Move on, you're blocking my view. Da Mayor lowers the can from his mouth and looks up at his heckler. It's obvious from the look on his face he's heard this before. Da Mayor contorts his face and stares at her.
MOTHER SISTER: You ugly enough. Don't stare at me. Da Mayor changes his face into a more grotesque look.
MOTHER SISTER: The evil eye doesn't work on me.
DA MAYOR: Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?

DA MAYOR: One day you'll be nice to me. We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice. At least civil.
ANGLETINA: Tina bends down and scoops her baby son HECTOR up from the bed and holds him for dear life to her breasts. She talks to her son while walking around the room.
TINA: Hector, I shouldn't be telling you this but you would find out sooner or later. Ya father ain't no real father. He's a bum, a two-bit bum in a hundred-dollar world. Your father is to the curb. You're smart. I see that look on ya face. You're saying if he's such a bum why am I with him? Good question. Like I said before, you're no dummy. He talked his way into my panties, I thought being a mother would make me happy, make me whole. He's a mistake, but you are not. Tina kisses her son. Tina is seventeen years old, another teenage parent.

ANGLERADIO RAHEEM: As usual we hear the rap music of Radio Raheem, but underneath the salsa music. Radio Raheem does not like to be bested; the salsa music from the parked car is giving him competition, this is no good. Radio Raheem stands in front of the stoop and raises his decibel level.
ANGLESTOOP: The Puerto Rican men look at him, then begin to yell at him in Spanish. There is a standoff, the rap and salsa clashing in a deafening roar. One of the men, STEVIE, gets off the stoop and goes to the car.

ANGLERADIO RAHEEM: Radio Raheem screams, he goes crazy.
RADIO RAHEEM: My music! Radio Raheem picks Sal up from behind the counter and starts to choke his ass. Radio Raheem's prized possessionhis box, the only thing he owned of valuehis box, the one thing that gave him any sense of worthhas been smashed to bits. ( Radio Raheem, like many Black youth, is the victim of materialism and a misplaced sense of values. ) Now he doesn't give a fuck anymore. He's gonna make Sal pay with his life.
