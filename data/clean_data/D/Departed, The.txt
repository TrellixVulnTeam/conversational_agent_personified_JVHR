BILLY: ( sotto voce to BROWN ) Rage issues and lower median IQ.
DRILL INSTRUCTOR: You say something?

BILLY: Sir, yes sir.
COLIN: ( calling to other cops )
QUEENAN: Congratulations on passing the detective exam, and welcome to the Special Investigation Unit.
DIGNAM: ( tonelessly ) Whoop-di fuckin' do.
QUEENAN: We won't be working directly together, you'll be working for Captain Ellerby, but I like to see You're a worker, you rise fast.

QUEENAN'S SECRETARY: ( coldly ) You can go in there now.
QUEENAN: You can sit.
BILLY: Sir, yes, sir, I have an idea.
SGT. DIGNAM: Whoa, let's say you have no idea and leave it there. No idea. Zip, none. If you had an idea about what we do we would not be good at what we do. We would be cunts. Are you calling us cunts?
QUEENAN: ( not looking up from Staff Sergeant Dignam has a style of his own. I'm afraid we all have to deal with it.
SGT. DIGNAM: ( getting to business, You have family connections down in Southie. Through your father. Tell us about your uncle Jackie.
BILLY: Uncle Jackie was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.
SGT. DIGNAM: Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.
BILLY: That's right. I remember his funeral.
SGT. DIGNAM: ( cruelly ) Closed casket?
BILLY: That's right.
SGT. DIGNAM: You tell anybody at Deerfield - that is, before you got kicked out for whaling on a gym teacher with a folding chair - you had an uncle met his demise like that?
BARRIGAN: What you got? "Staff Sergeant". In four years you're a sergeant.
COLIN: SIU. What a country.
BARRIGAN: ( after a beat )
COLIN: I don't mind going it alone. If you could go it alone you might get somewhere yourself.
BARRIGAN: We're cops. This isn't "somewhere".
COLIN: I know you're a worker. I might be able to do something for you. You got any suits at home or you like coming to work looking like you're gonna invade Poland.
SGT. DIGNAM: Let's look at the rest of the family tree. Your maggot uncle Tommy Costiganhe's another goof got busted selling guns to federal officers. Among many, many, many other departures from, ah, "normative behavior".
BILLY: What's this got to do with me?
SGT. DIGNAM: Why are you pretending to be a cop?
ELLERBY: This unit is new, and you are the newest members of it. You have been selected for it on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.
DIGNAM: Your old man was a hump from Southie. Baggage-handler at the airport. Family's all criminals except your old man.
BILLY: And one priest. Since you seem to know everything.
DIGNAM: I ain't sure about him, either. ( ALT: Last I heard he was happily married to a 12 year old boy and living on a beach in Thailand. ) Family's dug into the Southie projects like ticks. Lifers down there. Three decker men at best. You grew up, however, up the North shore. La di ( fuckin' ) da.
SGT. DIGNAM: You have different accents? You did, didn't you. ( You little fuckin' snake. ) You were different fuckin' people.
BILLY: You a psychiatrist?
SGT. DIGNAM: If I was I'd ask you why you're a Statie making thirty grand a year. And I think if I were Sigmund fucking Freud himself I wouldn't get an answer. So tell me, what's a lace curtain motherfucker like you doing in the Staties?
BILLY: Well. Families are always rising or falling in America. Am I right?
QUEENAN: ( appreciative, kindly, Who said that?
BILLY: SGT. DIGNAM ( although he knows perfectly well who Hawthorne is ) makes a fart-noise with his mouth. BILLY looks at him with an "I'm going to kill you" expression which is not without wit and which Dignam seems to admire.
DIGNAM: What's the matter, smartass? You don't know any fuckin' Shakespeare?
QUEENAN: We have a question. You want to be a cop, or do you want to appear to be a cop. It's an honest question. Lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun. Badge. Pretend they're on TV.
SGT. DIGNAM: A lot of em just want to slam a nigger's head through a plate glass I'm all set without your personal job application, Sergeant.
BILLY: I'm all set without your personal job application, Sergeant.
DIGNAM: ( after a "we got a live What the fuck did you say to me,
BILLY: Sir, with all due respect, sir, what is it you want from me?
DIGNAM: Hey asshole, he can't help you. I know what you are, and what you aren't. I'm the best friend you ever had on the face of the earth. I'm gonna help you understand something: You're no fuckin' cop.
QUEENAN: He's right. We deal in deceptions here. But what we don't deal with is self- deception. In five years, you might be anything else in the world, but you won't be a Massachusetts State You sure of that?
BILLY: You sure of that?
QUEENAN: I'm sure of that.
DIGNAM: ( looking up from his You don't have much family.
QUEENAN: ( looking up from his You don't have much family.
BILLY: ( deciding this on the I don't have any family.
WASP UNCLE: What's this I hear from Stephanie about you becoming a policeman?
BILLY: You mean Stephanie who was the only one who came to my father's funeral? That Stephanie?
UNCLE: That Stephanie.
BILLY: Nothing much to it Uncle Edward.
UNCLE: Are you trying to prove something to the family?
BILLY: When you say "family", what do you mean? You?
UNCLE: You always question everything, don't you?
BILLY: Yeah, well, maybe it would have done you some good to have a question from time to time. "Am I an asshole?" "Are my kids a mess?" "Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?" Those are questions. "Have I been good to my dying sister or am I just pretending to Too late now, right?
UNCLE: Do you need some money for the
BILLY: When my mother dies we don't have any connection. You got it?
REALTOR: This is it. Nice. You've got high ceilings, parquet floors. There's a lock on the fridge in case you have eating issues.. Joke.not a very good one. So, you're a policeman?
COLIN: ( like something he is used I'm a State Police detective.
REALTOR: ( wondering where he gets State Police Detective. You a married State Police Detective?
COLIN: ( coming out of his reverie Oh, cuz it's big and I wondered if a cop.
REALTOR: Oh, cuz it's big and I wondered if a cop.
COLIN: I have a cosigner.
REALTOR: You intend to have a housemate. That's cool.
COLIN: Give me the fuckin' papers.
BILLY: So what do I do?
QUEENAN: During the war, Churchill used river mines. He'd float them down the rivers into Germany. They'd either hit something, or not. That's what we'll use you for. I'll float you down the river. The rest will happen. Or it won't.
DIGNAM: Luck of the Irish. All that and you're still young enough to fuck We can't conceal that you've been a trainee. You'll be convicted of a crime. We're thinking that a guilty plea to assault and battery might make sense.
QUEENAN: We can't conceal that you've been a trainee. You'll be convicted of a crime. We're thinking that a guilty plea to assault and battery might make sense.
DIGNAM: Given your nature.
QUEENAN: You'll serve enough jail time to convince anyone that it's no set- up. You'll be on probation. The whole nine yards.
DIGNAM: I need you, pal. You've already pretended to be a Costigan from South Boston.
BILLY: Every weekend.Sergeant.
DIGNAM: Do it again. For me.
QUEENAN: Do it again. For me.
LATER: BILLY is alone at the grave. He looks at the tags on wind- blown wreaths. One gives him pause. Under a picture of The Virgin it reads: "Heaven holds the Faithful Departed" and is signed: "F. Costello".
OTHER PRISONER: You're Bill Costigan?
BILLY: Who wants to know?
OTHER PRISONER: Nothin.' I know a Sean Costigan. L My cousin.
BILLY: My cousin.
OTHER PRISONER: Connected but not too bright No offense.
SGT. DIGNAM: Sorry I'm late.
ELLERBY: Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison with the undercover section. Their undercover work is extensive. He's here to give us his report. Sgt. Dignam.
SGT. DIGNAM: OK. They're out there, my people. They're like the fuckin' Indians. You're not gonna see them. You're not gonna hear about them except through me or Captain Queenan. You will not, ever, know the identity of undercover people. This shit hole, unfortunately, has more fuckin' leaks than the Iraqi navy.
ELLERBY: Fuck yourself.
SGT. DIGNAM: I'm tired from fucking your wife.
ELLERBY: How's your mother?
SGT. DIGNAM: Good. She's tired from fucking my OK, today, girls, what I got for you is microprocessors.

SGT. DIGNAM: Myles Kennefick. Got the job with a forged UMass transcript. UMass Boston, which incidentally happens to be in.

ELLERBY: We are not here to solve the "Case of the Dead Scumbag". We are here to nail Costello.
SGT. DIGNAM: We got a guy says that he hears Costello is moving the processors to China.that he set up the whole fuckin' job and popped Kennefick. You don't want to miss it if Costello takes a dump.
ELLERBY: We'd miss less if your informants were available to us, and of course to the FBI ( Bureau ).
LAZIO: Without asking for details, do you have anyone in with Costello Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself. My theory on Feds is they're like mushrooms. Feed 'em shit and keep in the dark. You girls have a nice day.
SGT. DIGNAM: Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself. My theory on Feds is they're like mushrooms. Feed 'em shit and keep in the dark. You girls have a nice day.

BILLY: Not for a long time. Down the cape after Rose's wedding. I think.
SEAN: Fuck, oh shit. I remember that, dude. I had that fuckin' buck knife, right, and I cut all the brass numbas off the doors at the hotel. I was trippin'.All of them. That was a night.
BILLY: Listen, I got twenty thousand dollars when my mother died. In your line of work, if I gave you ten thousand dollars what could you give me back?
SEAN: In your line of work, if I gave you ten thousand dollars what could you give me back?
BILLY: In your line of work, if I gave you ten thousand dollars what could you give me back?
SEAN: My line of work. I'm not in that line of work just presently because I don't have ten thousand dollars. As a matter of fact I have never had ten thousand dollars.
BILLY: That's what I'm saying.
SEAN: You know what we usually say at these moments.
BILLY: You fuckin' moron. What are you talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm your cousin.
SEAN: Fuckin' Ricans think they know everything. If they knew shit they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.
BILLY: Why would you even think of stopping drinking?
SEAN: He don't like it. He don't like drinkin.he don't like fightin. .he says stay out of the bars. You know, we're not even supposed to do this on this side of fuckin' Who says?
BILLY: Who says?
SEAN: He says. Costello says. God says, as far as you're concerned.

BILLY: Get your hands off me.
MISTER FRENCH: Do you know me?
BILLY: BILLY shakes his head no.
MISTER FRENCH: I'm the guy who tells you there are guys you hit and there are guys you don't. That's not quite a guy you can't hit, but it's almost a guy you can't hit, so I'm fucking ruling on it right now that you don't hit him, understand?
BILLY: Yeah. Excellent. Fine.
MISTER FRENCH: I know you. I know your family. Also I know you do another drug deal with your idiot fucking cop- magnet cousin I'll forget your grandmother was very nice to me and cut your fucking nuts off. You understand that?

FRENCH: Get the fuck out of here.
COLIN: Mrs. Kennefick, Myles and I were in school together. Myles was behind me in school but I knew him. I will get those responsible. Don't you want to see us catch whoever used him to do a robbery and then killed If he was killed he probably did something wrong.
MRS KENNEFICK: ( grimaces ) If he was killed he probably did something wrong.
COLIN: ( grimaces ) If he was killed he probably did something wrong.
MRS KENNEFICK: If he was killed he probably did something wrong.
COLIN: You don't mean robbery do you, Mrs Kennefick? That's not what you think he did wrong.
COSTELLO: Wave to your girlfriend.
MRS KENNEFICK: I mean fuck yourself.
COLIN: You get that?
BARRIGAN: "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself?"
COLIN: Welcome to the neighborhood.
COSTELLO: Cut 'em here.

MADOLYN: When was the last time you checked?
COLIN: Before I went to fucking Suffolk.
MADOLYN: I went to U Mass. I wasn't insulting you.
COLIN: Well I thought you were, and for that you have to take me to dinner.
MADOLYN: Maybe you could shoot someone and I'd have to see you professionally.
COLIN: Whatever it takes. I'll stab someone in the heart with an icepick right now if it gets me dinner with you.
BILLY: You guys from Providence?
PROPRIETOR: What have you done to my place! Get out of here.

COLIN: I don't know what you're gonna do, but if it moves I'm going to arrest it ( shoot it ).
MADOLYN: Why, does that make you

MADOLYN: If you actually do I'll see you Who says I want to see you again?
COLIN: Who says I want to see you again?
MADOLYN: ( concerned, perhaps Don't you?
COLIN: Yes, course I do. What Freud said about the Irish is We're the only people impervious to
MADOLYN: Some people do get better.
COLIN: Fair enough.
MADOLYN: Sometimes, though, I want people to forget about their personal bullshit and do their jobs.
COLIN: Including the criminals?
MADOLYN: If they don't do their jobs you don't have one.
COLIN: Me? I'd just arrest innocent people. I'll arrest you right now.
MADOLYN: You're trouble.
COLIN: You don't know the half of it.
COSTELLO: Do you know who I am?
BILLY: You met my friend, Mister French the other night.
COSTELLO: You met my friend, Mister French the other night.
BILLY: Is his real name Mister French?
COSTELLO: ( a beat ) Come with me. ( As BILLY hesitates ) I'm not the cops. I'm not askin'
COSTELLO: Those guys you tuned up are connected down Providence. What they're going to do is come back up with some guys and kill you. Which, sure as you're born, they will do unless I stop them. Do you want me to stop them?
BILLY: Is it something I can't do
COSTELLO: I'm going to have my associate search you.
BILLY: Search me? Search me for what?
MISTER FRENCH: C'm here.

MISTER FRENCH: Shoes off.
COSTELLO: I knew your father.
BILLY: Yeah. He's dead.
COSTELLO: I'm sorry. How did he go?
BILLY: He didn't complain.
COSTELLO: That was his problem.
BILLY: Who said he had a fuckin' problem.
COSTELLO: I just said he had a fuckin' problem. There's a man could have been anything.
BILLY: Are you saying he was nothing?
COSTELLO: I'm saying he worked at the
MISTER FRENCH: He's clean.
COSTELLO: The arm.
BILLY: COSTELLO twists Billy's broken hand.
COSTELLO: You swear on your mother's grave that you're not a cop.
BILLY: I am not a cop.
COSTELLO: You stop doing coke deals with your jerk-off cousin?
BILLY: COSTELLO lets go of Billy's hand. Billy is weeping on the floor. COSTELLO straightens his suit.
COSTELLO: Take it easy. Get your hand taken care of. I'm sorry. It was necessary. As for our problem with Providence.let's not cry over spilled guineas.
COSTELLO: What's this IRA motherfucker doing in my bar?
JIMMY: Ah, she's on her way out.
COSTELLO: We all are. Act accordingly.

MISTER FRENCH: One too many.
COLIN: The principles of detection tell me that these men came from I'd appreciate it if you got out of my crime scene.
LYNN DETECTIVE: I'd appreciate it if you got out of my crime scene.
COLIN: This is my crime scene, but knock yourself out.
COSTELLO: Who's the lead detective?.Good, he's a moron.
COLIN: In the trunk or the glove box?. All right.
COLIN: Wanna see some dead guys?
COSTELLO: Have a seat, Billy.
BILLY: Thank you.
COSTELLO: ( he looks up ) You know John Lennon?
BILLY: Yeah, he was president before Lennon said `I'm an artist. You give me a fuckin' tuba and I'll get you something out of it'.
COSTELLO: ( smiles ) Lennon said `I'm an artist. You give me a fuckin' tuba and I'll get you something out of it'.
BILLY: I'd like to squeeze some fuckin' money out of it.
COSTELLO: Smart mouth. Too bad.
COSTELLO: The point with John Lennon is a man can look at anything and make something out of it. For instance, I look at you and I think what can I use you for?
DIGNAM: That was quick. He dead already?
COLIN: This will get Captain Ellerby on the six o'clock news.
BARRIGAN: No wonder you get ahead.
BILLY: I won't do it if I have to wear a wire. No wires. Ever, ever, you understand me? You don't know what this is like. Micro what?

COLIN: I've been put in charge of this unit. It is a small surveillance sub-unit but it is mine. And I didn't take this job in order to fuck it up, or to let anyone else fuck it up, whosoever they may be. I hand picked this group. You are my A-team so I want you to conduct yourselves accordingly.
BROWN: Yeah. Really.
COLIN: Yeah. Really.
BROWN: Do we have direct access to Queenan's undercovers?
COLIN: ( not happy about this ) No. Ah.not presently. Not presently. But I'm hoping to get things.reorganized. That's it. Congratulations. Don't disappoint
BARRIGAN: ( to Brown ) I know why I'm here. I made him feel guilty. Why are you here?
BROWN: Intelligence and aptitude.
BARRIGAN: That's new.
COLIN: Hello Dad. I have a new job. ( ALT: I got a promotion. )
MISTER FRENCH: Where's your fucking license? I don't see no fucking license.
BOOKIE: What license.
MISTER FRENCH: There's no such thing as a license, of course, but you definitely have to have one. If you are not being run by us you will be run by someone else, which means you will have let undesirable elements into Mr. Costello's area.
HARD GUY: ( spitting teeth ) I was going for my fucking
MISTER FRENCH: Hey, that's Jimmy Bags. What the fuck you doin'?
BILLY: What the fuck. I didn't know..
BOOKIE: There's no profit if I pay him two grand a week. I'm in the hole if I pay him two grand a week.
MISTER FRENCH: Then make more money or go out of business. This is America. If you don't make money you're a fucking douchebag. What are you going to Make more money.
BOOKIE: Make more money.
MISTER FRENCH: That's the spirit.
MISTER FRENCH: Very interesting.
BILLY: Yeah, well. Fuck.
MISTER FRENCH: Don't worry about it. Guy didn't need need his teeth anyway. Maybe if he was an Eskimo. But in this country we eat a variety of items.
COSTELLO: He was.
BILLY: He was.
MISTER FRENCH: Reaching for his cigarettes.
BILLY: Okay! You gonna give me shit, it wasn't no reasonhe put his hand in his coat! I don't know if he's a bookie or what the fuck he's Well, you know what the fuck a bookie does?
COSTELLO: ( interrupting ) Well, you know what the fuck a bookie does?
BILLY: ( to Costello ) Pays you.
COSTELLO: Bingo. Anyway, I like a guy who goes around knocking guys teeth out for no reason.
MISTER FRENCH: Forty-eight hours from the time this phone first rings, you take the fucking chip out - like so - and you fucking destroy it. After three days a phone ain't clean. If you use a phone which is not clean, you will have a accident. You never call us. We call you. You got that?
BILLY: I got it.
MISTER FRENCH: I can't fuckin' hear you.
BILLY: I got it.
BILLY: Don't look. There's a white van across the parking lot?

BILLY: What, do you got x-ray vision?
COSTELLO: ( not taking his eyes off They don't have directional People looking at you make you self- I don't know.
BILLY: I don't know.
COSTELLO: Why? They're minuses. They can't tell the difference between a rock star and a career criminal.
BILLY: Anyone not a criminal is a minus?
COSTELLO: What are you soft? That's not what I said. Eat something, Jesus Christ, we got a nice day by the water. Sun's shining, gulls are up.Nice smell of ozone.
BILLY: He never, ah, I mean never?
COSTELLO: He kept his own counsel. He never wanted money. You can't do a thing with a man like that. Your uncle Jackie needed a lot of money. But even though he got his money from me, he also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you. And I think about this.
BILLY: So what are talking about here?
COSTELLO: Fact is you're not a guy fresh from the zoo who wants to run a spring water distributor and I don't see you up the dog track as a general Look at it this way. It's like a tuba. I want to see if I can get something out of it.
BILLY: Look at it this way. It's like a tuba. I want to see if I can get something out of it.
COSTELLO: You ever think of going back to With all due respect, Mr. Costello, school's out.
BILLY: With all due respect, Mr. Costello, school's out.
COSTELLO: Well that's your problem. Maybe someday you'll wake the fuck up.
PRIESTS: ( terrified and Good morning [day], Francis, good
COSTELLO: You recall our chat? "I am as God made me", was that what you said? May I remind you, God don't run the bingo in this May I remind you, Mr. Costello, that pride comes before the fall.
YOUNG PRIEST: May I remind you, Mr. Costello, that pride comes before the fall.
COSTELLO: What comes before the Fall is the
COLIN: I'm not making enough progress with "Progress" is hard to define. I make progress every day. In fact, I'm making progress now. There are guys in this department make excellent progress for twenty years without ever getting anything you could definitively call a result. It's like any American industry. Nobody minds if you don't succeed as long as you don't fuck up.
ELLERBY: "Progress" is hard to define. I make progress every day. In fact, I'm making progress now. There are guys in this department make excellent progress for twenty years without ever getting anything you could definitively call a result. It's like any American industry. Nobody minds if you don't succeed as long as you don't fuck up.
COLIN: Jimmy Pappas.
ELLERBY: And what happened to Jimmy Pappas?
COLIN: He had a heart attack in jail and got knifed in his bed at Boston City Hospital. I believe it's been in the papers.
ELLERBY: Are you happy with this result?
COLIN: It's a result.
ELLERBY: Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits.
COLIN: Cui gives a shit. It's got a bow on I think you are a cop, my son.
ELLERBY: ( with true appreciation ) I think you are a cop, my son.
BRIAN: No, please.
FRENCH: Brian, stop it, I ain't gonna hurt
QUEENAN: Hey. Let's go through the routine.
DIGNAM: You think you can pop someone. There's no special card to play. The guy whose jaw you broke was Boston Police Department.
BILLY: I'm going fuckin' nuts. I can't be someone else every day.
DIGNAM: Most of the people in the world do it every day. What's the big deal?
BILLY: I'm not them.
DIGNAM: You're nobody. You signed the paper. We're the only people in the world who know that you're a cop. Maybe we'll just erase your
BILLY: Maybe I'll fucking kill you.
QUEENAN: Easy now. That was a joke, Billy.
DIGNAM: Just because you play a fucking tough guy doesn't mean you are one, you lace curtain fucking pussy.
QUEENAN: ( gently, like a man Be smart. If someone was watching how are we supposed to not arrest
BILLY: When are you going to take Costello? What's wrong with taking 'em on any one of the million felonies you've seen him do. Get him for pissing in the street.
DIGNAM: Well. That would stick.
QUEENAN: You shut up. We're building a case. It takes time. You know that.
BILLY: There's something wrong.
QUEENAN: Maybe. Maybe.
DIGNAM: Keep your ears opened. No I want you to listen for any chatter about a spy in the Special Investigation Unit. You hear anything like that?
QUEENAN: I want you to listen for any chatter about a spy in the Special Investigation Unit. You hear anything like that?
BILLY: Are you serious?
QUEENAN: I'm afraid so.
BILLY: Jesus H. Christ.
QUEENAN: Hang tight for me. Just a little longer. We're this close.
BILLY: Thank you, Billy
QUEENAN: Thank you, Billy
COLIN: ( to Brown ) What have you got?
BROWN: Uniform clipped him on the Pike for a suspended licence. However, as he's the subject of an open At least one. He's one of Costello's crew.
COLIN: At least one. He's one of Costello's crew.
BROWN: we're entitled to get a warrant. We can't get an address off him. He paged his lawyer but the lawyer hasn't called back yet.
COLIN: Who's the lawyer?
BROWN: He didn't know the name. He just had the number on a card. Beeper Did he beep him?
COLIN: Did he beep him?
BROWN: All right.
COLIN: All right.
BROWN: Give my your phone and turn the fucking camera off. Who's is this? I'm gonna take this.
COLIN: Give my your phone and turn the fucking camera off. Who's is this? I'm gonna take this.
BROWN: He can't do that, can he?
BARRIGAN: He just did.
COLIN: Mr. Fitzgibbon, afternoon.
FITZY: You my attorney?
COLIN: What do you think? Did you make any statements or phone calls I need to be aware of?
FITZY: I beeped you. The card they gave me.that's it.
COLIN: That's it? Don't you have to call your mother and tell her you're not gonna be home for supper?
FITZY: Mum, I'm not gonna make it for supper. I got held up. Yeah, talk to you later.
MISTER FRENCH: Everybody out. Move.
FITZY: Who are you? When do I get out of I think you need another attorney, after all, Mr. Fitzgibbon. Have a nice day.
COLIN: I think you need another attorney, after all, Mr. Fitzgibbon. Have a nice day.
COLIN: Run the last number called. That'll be his house. Whatever the location is I'll swear I surveilled him at it. Abracafuckindabra.
BROWN: Why'd you use my phone?
COLIN: Because you didn't go in there.
MADOLYN: The light's nice here in the
COLIN: I gotta go to work.
BILLY: It's like confession. Isn't it. This sort of thing.
MADOLYN: I know they do.
BILLY: People are liars. They want to be stars of their little films.
MADOLYN: That's an interesting observation.
BILLY: Do you lie?
MADOLYN: Why do you?
BILLY: I'm asking if you lie.
MADOLYN: Honesty isn't synonymous with You lie. So, is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally, or just for the fuck of it?
BILLY: You lie. So, is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally, or just for the fuck of it?
MADOLYN: I expect sometimes.people.do it to keep things.on an even keel.
BILLY: So, you had a parent who was a
MADOLYN: ( flustered ) Did you?
BILLY: ( simply ) Let's keep this with you.
MADOLYN: Let's keep this with you.
BILLY: ( abruptly ) There was a cop leaving when I came How do you know he was a cop?
MADOLYN: How do you know he was a cop?
BILLY: Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight air of scumbag entitlement. You see cops?
MADOLYN: That's part of what I do. Although, I don't normally see cadets who were kicked out of the Academy.
BILLY: You should get a better job.
MADOLYN: Sometimes they cry if they had trouble at home or if they've had to.use their weapons.
BILLY: Let me tell you something. They signed up to use their fuckin' weapons. Most of them. But they watch enough TV so they know they have to "weep" after they use their weapons. No one's more full of shit than a cop. Except a cop on TV.
MADOLYN: I looked through your file and I see you have a record of assault. What was it like for you in jail?
BILLY: You want to hear about the showers?
MADOLYN: Did something happen to you?
BILLY: ( a beat ) You sit there with a mass murderer, your heart-rate jacked, your hand.steady. That's one thing I found out about myself in prison. My hand doesn't shake, ever.
MADOLYN: What do you expect from coming I have to come here.
BILLY: I have to come here.
MADOLYN: I know it's not elective.on your part.but, now that you're here, what do you want?
BILLY: You want the truth? If you lied, you'd have an easier time getting what you wanted.
MADOLYN: If you lied, you'd have an easier time getting what you wanted.
BILLY: What's that say about what you do for a living?
MADOLYN: Look, I think we better have a few more meetings before we can even talk about prescriptions.
BILLY: I'm having panic attacks. You didn't even ask about that. Last night I thought I was having a fucking heart attack. I puked in a trash barrel on the way in here, I haven't slept for weeks.
MADOLYN: Is this true?
BILLY: Yes. I said something true. I want some fucking pills and you close my file? I thought I was supposed to tell the truth here.
MADOLYN: Yes, you are.
BILLY: If only fuckin' here.
MADOLYN: You can leave!
BILLY: What if that was a legitimate threat? ( Hot shot ).
MADOLYN: EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE THE OFFICE BUILDING. DAY Very windy. Papers blowing. Billy is walking. Madolyn catches up to him.
MADOLYN: Why is the hardest patient of the day always the last one?
BILLY: Because you're bored and tired and don't give a shit. It's not Look, I'm not just.somebody you have to see or they put you in jail. If you are in distress I will help you.
MADOLYN: Look, I'm not just.somebody you have to see or they put you in jail. If you are in distress I will help you.
BILLY: What's this?
MADOLYN: My card. And a prescription for twenty Lorazepam.
BILLY: Is it enough to kill myself?
MADOLYN: ( she fixes him with a Maybe it is. All right? Have I done my job up to your goddamned standards? Because by my standards you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior, and fuck you if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.
BILLY: ( re: prescription ) Thank you.
MADOLYN: I'm transferring you to another
BILLY: You wanna get a cup of coffee?
ELLERBY: All right, let's bring it in, please. Come in please. Our target is a major transaction of microprocessors. Yes, those. I don't know what they are. You don't know what they are. Who gives a fuck? Cash will be handed over in a building which we have under AV surveillance. Staff Sergeant Sullivan's team. Will ID the bad guys and listen in on the phones.
COLIN: ( to his guys ) Did you guys know anything about ( to LAZIO ) How long have we been tapped on this building?
ELLERBY: ( to LAZIO ) How long have we been tapped on this building?
COLIN: ( to team ) Go find out what we're doing and get on it.
ELLERBY: Sorry to get you at the last minute. But things leak. This lead came from Queenan's undercover guy.
COLIN: ( into cell ) ( on phone )
COLIN: I'm not going to make dinner. Something big has come up.
COSTELLO: Too bad. Your mother worked all goddamned day. We'll just have to sit down without you and your
COLIN: Oh, my friends are still coming.
QUEENAN: The readiness is all. You know the players, call the game.
COLIN: Thank you, Captain.
LATER: COLIN joins his team ( BROWN AND BARRIGAN ), who are seated in a U shaped work-area. COLIN, still stunned by the fact of this operations center, swallows as he notices on video three angles of a building he seems to know very well. He sits down and puts a headset on. A GEEK COP leans over and shakes his COLIN nods. QUEENAN comes up.
GEEK COP: Piece of cake. I'll operate the cameras. You ID the guys and log
QUEENAN: All cellphone signals are under surveillance through the courtesy of our Federal friends over
ELLERBY: ( as if on coke and he Patriot Act. Love it. Love it.
COLIN: All right. That's Costello right there. Costello, Mister French, Fitzy, Delahunt, Billy Costigan the new guy.Time is 10.46.
BROWN: Who are they meeting?
ELLERBY: ( leaning over screens ) I don't know. Some Chinamen from points unknown. They're already
ELLERBY: Why do you have a blind spot?
ELLERBY: It never crossed my mind. You get a camera in the back?
COSTELLO: Turn off your cell phones.
CAMERA COP: ( to no one, and maybe OS ) Maybe if we had some Homeland security money like some other fucking douchebags I could
QUEENAN: Any calls?
ELLERBY: Search randomly for calls made from the area.
ELLERBY: Narrow the area.
LAZIO: What you see for coverage is what you get.
DIGNAM: ( like Queenan, an observer Why the fuck did they turn off their phones?
DIGNAM: A single light on the screen. QUEENAN looks at an IM ( from Billy ) on his phone.
QUEENAN: The buyers are there.
ELLERBY: You know, direct access to your fucking guys would have certain fuckin' advantages.
QUEENAN: ( mildly ) Not to my guy.
DIGNAM: This is unbelievable. Fuck it, who put the cameras in the fucking place?
DIGNAM: I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy.
QUEENAN: Hey, hey, hey.
COSTELLO: ( to translator ) How you going, Robert?
CHINESE TRANSLATOR: Tops, Mr. Costello. I want to tell you that at least two of these gents have machine guns.
CHINESE GANGSTER: ( in Cantonese, not Waiting, waiting. We almost departed! This man is from the Embassy. He will have to blow his brains out if he is captured. His entire family will be killed.
CHINESE TRANSLATOR: He's a little upset.
COSTELLO: Tell him light on the starch.
CHINESE TRANSLATOR: ( roughly translating ) He's fronting the Chinese government and he's just scared Government man. ( loudly, to Chinese ) I'm concerned about Chinamen who think it's wise to bring automatic weapons to a business transaction.
COSTELLO: Government man. I'm concerned about Chinamen who think it's wise to bring automatic weapons to a business transaction.
CHINESE GANGSTER: Ngup, Ngup, Ngup. Ngaw um ming. Kay ngup mutt. [Yap, yap, yap. I don't understand. What is he
COSTELLO: For his own good, tell Bruce Lee and the Karate Kids none of us are carrying automatic weapons because here, in this country, it don't add inches to your dick. You get a life sentence for it.
CHINESE GANGSTER: ( in Cantonese ) Put away that machine gun.
COSTELLO: If these chinks want to nuke Taiwan any time in this century, you tell them they better shape up fast and show me one million dollars.
CHINESE GANGSTER: Nay tiey ching chaw yut bok mon. [Make sure it's real. It's a million dollars.]. ALTERNATE/ALSO ( insult ): Ne dei yeeche ling ngnaw dong maw gok nay chun. [Next time you make me wait, I'm going to cut your dick off.
COSTELLO: In English, thank you, also.
CHINESE GANGSTER: Du ne. [Fuck you.]
COSTELLO: The expedition continues this way.
ELLERBY: Don't tell me those cars were empty. Please don't tell me those Chinamen's cars were empty. Do you have a camera in the back.
COSTELLO: See, no surveillance here. They didn't figure we had a navy. Always figure an exit for your business partners. What with everything all dug up, you can't trust a slant to find the Mass Pike and, with or without Staties out front, frankly I don't approve of orientals driving to begin with.
BILLY: What about us, Frank? What're we gonna do?
COSTELLO: We depart. We didn't commit no
MISTER FRENCH: Except sell the ching chongs a bunch of fuckin' plastic.
MADOLYN: Good Morning.
COLIN: Good morning.
MADOLYN: I beat the movers.
COLIN: How was the last night in the, ah, old establishment?
MADOLYN: ( putting the box on the kitchen counter ) I'm glad to hear that. It sucked here, too.
COLIN: I'm glad to hear that. It sucked here, too.
MADOLYN: I'm gonna thank your Uncle Alphonsus for the square footage.
COLIN: Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven. So am I.
MADOLYN: French donut?
COLIN: ( re: box of stuff ) Yeah. Hey, can I.
MADOLYN: Sure yeah.
COLIN: Well, we're not having this out.
MADOLYN: MADOLYN isn't prepared to be at cross-purposes. But she is taken aback. She puts the photo quietly away. Contaminated.
COLIN: You don't see any pictures of where I came from. Look, I respect who you are, but not in the living room. We might have company.
MADOLYN: She laughs. COLIN looks at a diploma. Veritas.
COLIN: Why work for the state?
MADOLYN: Why not? You do.
COLIN: Not forever, and you don't have to. You've got degrees.you're a hot shit. I mean, what you do, why make as much as a guidance I believe in public service.
MADOLYN: ( deadpan, over her coffee I believe in public service.
COLIN: Now you're just being ridiculous.
MADOLYN: ( kissing him, and You like me living here?
COLIN: ( hands down her shorts ) Yes I do.
MADOLYN: Mayor Sullivan's Office.
COLIN: Who is it?
MADOLYN: I think it's a guy with a, ah, A cancer guy.
COLIN: ( CONTINUED )
CONTINUOUS: COLIN hunches, closing the glass door, and glancing in at
COLIN: Nothin', nothin'. It doesn't have any power, that's all. It just happened once.
COSTELLO: Was that that shrink cunt answered the phone?
COLIN: Yes. Yes. As I said, she was gonna move in, so she moved in.
COSTELLO: You better get organized, quick.
COLIN: Last time I checked, I tipped you off and you're not in jail.

COLIN: ( CONTINUED )
COSTELLO: Are listening to me, son? Do you like Little Miss Thing sucking your
COLIN: Yes. Yes I do.
COSTELLO: So earn it. I'm gettin' the feeling we got a cop in my crew.
COLIN: I been gettin' that same feeling.
COSTELLO: He's one of yours. Inside. Have you seen anything?
COLIN: Look, I have no access to undercover files in Queenan's department. It's locked up. Queenan and Dignam run the snitches. They don't give anybody a peep. I'm doing the best.
COSTELLO: ( interrupting ) Your best? What do you think we're in, the fuckin' haberdashery
COLIN: Please Frank, if you don't relax I can't relax. Let's start with this.get me all the information on the people around you last night. Everyone that works for you. Get me real first names. Get me.
COSTELLO: ( interrupting Colin ) Get you? Give you? Who the fuck do you work for?
COLIN: Okay, Frank.I'm sorry.could you please get me social security numbers, ah, I need drivers license numbers, full names, dates of birth, anything like that. Bank account numbers, everything that you don't get from a criminal record or, or a wrap sheet or a.
COSTELLO: ( relenting a little ) Collie, calm down or you'll shoot in your pants. I'll get you the records and whatnot. You'll have 'em but listen to me son, don't disappoint me on this, or some other guy will be putting their cock up Little Miss Freud's ass.
QUEENAN: How are you, Francis?
COSTELLO: My mother called me Francis.
QUEENAN: I know she did. And your father called you the tumor.
COSTELLO: Oh, what did your father call you, Charlie? Oh yeah, I forgot, he wasn't around.
QUEENAN: Where are the real microprocessors,
COSTELLO: Microprocessors.oh yeah, I heard that story. You arrested some Chinese government guy at the border carrying some light sockets or somethin'.
DIGNAM: I can't wait to wipe that fuckin' smirk off your face.
COSTELLO: ( to Dignam ) Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for I will get you, Frank.
QUEENAN: I will get you, Frank.
COSTELLO: If you could've you would've but I guess you like to go at your own Excuse me, I've got a date with some angels.
QUEENAN: Sooner than you think, Francis.

MADOLYN: You have a boss that has a No, no, no. That was a guy who works for me.
COLIN: No, no, no. That was a guy who works for me.
MADOLYN: You're lying to me.
COLIN: Not exactly. There are certain things I will not be able to talk to you about. I cannot allow you to jeopardize an ongoing investigation. ( Or your own life. ) There really are things connected to my job that you can't ask about. That you don't want to know about.
MADOLYN: ( after a beat ) Okay, then say that.
COLIN: I will. Thank you.
MADOLYN: That's the movers.
COLIN: You still wanna stay?
MADOLYN: I do.
COLIN: ( re: doorbell ) All right. All right. I'm coming.
DIGNAM: Queenan had a funeral to go to. This is my shift. Calm down.
BILLY: Why shouldn't I get on a fucking plane? Meet up? Do you actually want me dead? There's a rat in your unit. That's a fact. You just don't know it. Where's Queenan?
DIGNAM: He's not here.
BILLY: They knew you had cameras in the building. You have a leak from the inside. It's real. Smoke him out.
DIGNAM: And how do we do that Mr. fucking genius who didn't even graduate the Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you're getting a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our department but tell SIU. Flush it and see if it comes out of the pipe on my end. That's first. Narrow it down. Where's Queenan.
BILLY: Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you're getting a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our department but tell SIU. Flush it and see if it comes out of the pipe on my end. That's first. Narrow it down. Where's Queenan.
DIGNAM: Are you deaf? He's not here. Call me when you get something real.
BILLY: It's me.
MADOLYN: I'm assuming you want to change things, you know, change the people you know, change the people you meet, change everything, anything. Too many choices can see like no choice at all.
BILLY: Confucius say that?
MADOLYN: So you do.something radical.
BILLY: "Something radical," huh?
MADOLYN: .yeah, you do. Sometimes it's just a matter of picking a thing and doing it.
BILLY: So how long you been with this guy?
MADOLYN: Oh, four months. About four months.
BILLY: You love this guy?
MADOLYN: It's pretty serious, yeah, it is.
BILLY: A head case or anything? I'm just No more than I am.

BILLY: Yeah, that's because of vastly superior intelligence. Godlike,
MADOLYN: OK, I'm in a serious, newly serious, relationship.there are.ups and downs.everybody has doubts, problems I mean doubts.
BILLY: What would you do if he was standing right there and saw us?
MADOLYN: I'd lie. To keep things on an even keel. You know all about it.
BILLY: You take off an armored car at the Dedham Mall and what do you do. Do you pay guineas in Providence?
BANKROBBER: Fucking now I do.
BILLY: What the fuck do you do.
BANKROBBER: What, I pay Costello and wait for him to trade me to the FBI? Cause that's what he does.
BILLY: FBI? What the fuck are you talking
BANKROBBER: Oh my God, is that French out What the fuck did you just say about the FBI?
BILLY: ( grabbing him by the What the fuck did you just say about the FBI?
BANKROBBER: Forget what I said. I'm fucking high, I'm high.
BILLY: Whatever's going through your very poor, very limited, brain.I'm not going to hurt you. Just tell me what you just fucking said.
BANKROBBER: Forget it, I'm high, I must be high, I would never say what you thought I said.
BILLY: Tell me what the fuck you said.
BANKROBBER: ( covered with blood ) Why do you think he's not arrested? Costello's a protected FBI informant. He'll trade you out. ( a beat ) I thought I was supposed to go into shock. I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts. It fucking hurts.
OUTSIDE: MISTER FRENCH is benignly watching kids light cherry bombs.
BILLY: Let's go.
BILLY: Hey, it's me.
QUEENAN: What do you want? What are you doing here?
BILLY: Come here.
QUEENAN: The FBI?
BILLY: He gives information to the FBI. He's a protected informant. Aren't they trying to make it a Federal case? And it never gets made?

ELLERBY: Congratulations. Haven't seen a guy like you since me. You'll be transferred to Internal Investigations but you will continue to work right where you are in the Special Investigation I don't get it.
COLIN: I don't get it.
ELLERBY: We are all convinced that Costello has at least one mole in the Special Investigation Unit.
COLIN: You'll investigate. Everybody. Well, that's just a dream job for a We have considered all possible candidates. You have an immaculate record. Some people never trust a guy with an immaculate record. I I have an immaculate record.

ELLERBY: That's a pity. Pretty much sucks as a game but you get to form How's the wedding coming along?
COLIN: Everything's great. On schedule. She's a doctor.
ELLERBY: Outstanding. That's good. Marriage is an important part of getting ahead. You don't want anyone thinking you're a homo. Married guy seems stable. People look at a wedding ring and think: someone can stand the son of a bitch. Ladies see the wedding ring and know immediately that you must have some cash and that your cock works.
COLIN: Oh, it's working. Overtime.
ELLERBY: I'm glad to hear that.
MISTER FRENCH: Boss wants your real name, your social, your license number, all your bank account numbers.

MISTER FRENCH: You fill in the papers, real name, all your numbers, no fucking around, and then we all wait here.
DELAHUNT: Put the forms in there.

MISTER FRENCH: Where you going?
ONSCREEN: Follow the envelope.
BILLY: Why can't Ellerby's guys? SIU.
QUEENAN: They can't. They are compromised.
COSTELLO: Oh yeah, be dirty.
COLIN: Jesus Christ, Frank, I almost shot
COSTELLO: You're not indulging in self abuse are you?
COLIN: Frank, we got problems.
COSTELLO: I hope you're not turning into one of those sob sisters, who wants to get caught. You're not crackin' up are you?
COLIN: I don't crack up.

COLIN: Why did you show up then?
COSTELLO: I own the place.

COSTELLO: You're gettin' reassigned.
COLIN: How the fuck did you know that?
COSTELLO: Where'd they put you?
COLIN: I have to find myself.
COSTELLO: You're telling me, sonny boy.
COLIN: I have to find the guy you have in the department.
COSTELLO: With everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself, I put my money on nobody finding
COLIN: Frank, for me, you've got to lay Laying low is not what I do.
COSTELLO: Laying low is not what I do.
COLIN: Yeah, big fuckin' daddy Frank. Lookit, Frank, what good am I to you if you don't listen to me? Queenan's compartmentalizing. He's fuckin' smart, you know that. I will find this rat if you let me do it my way. If you let me do my job.
COSTELLO: ( gives him the envelope ) But Colin, I hope I won't have to remind you, that if you don't find that cheese eating rat bastard in your department so we can give him a halo, most likely it won't be me who pays for it.
COLIN: Why would you need to remind me of that? I didn't know that would I be any good at what I do? Trust me, I know how to do this.
COSTELLO: ( looking at the screen ) Maybe it's because it's always been so easy for me to get cunt that I never understood jerking off in a

COLIN: I'm now in charge of everything here. Including Queenan's informers. Theoretically. I can't unlock the files until after the brass squeezes Dignam. If the brass squeezes Dignam.
COSTELLO: So Dignam's the only one with the keys to the kingdom.
COLIN: He's fucking resigning. He put his papers in. He's not talking.
COSTELLO: Give me his location. Tonight.
MADOLYN: I thought I was the liar.
COLIN: I can explain.
BILLY: Costello recorded everything. He put all the tapes in a little box and kept them with his lawyer. That was his insurance. His lawyer came to me. Costello trusted me the most. Imagine that you rat fuck. Sound quality good enough? I was a little worried.
COLIN: What do you want?
BILLY: I want my identity, you two-faced rat prick.
COLIN: Where are you?
BILLY: Three o'clock. Where Queenan died. You keep your cell on.

COLIN: I can get you your.
BILLY: ( going for Colin's cuffs ) You didn't come here to talk, you fuckin' maggot, you came here to get arrested.
COLIN: Arrested? Arrested for what. So you got tapes of what? Costello was my informant. I was his rat? Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was my informant.
BILLY: Get up and shut your fuckin' mouth.
COLIN: What is this, a citizen's arrest? Blow me, prick. Only one of us is a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who you are. Nobody knows who you are.

BROWN: Put down the weapon and step away from Sergeant Sullivan.
BILLY: I called you. You specifically. You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot. I told you to meet me Help me.
COLIN: Help me.

BILLY: I told you I've got the evidence cold linking this prick to You fuckin' know who I am. I'm taking him downstairs now.
COLIN: I can't wait for you to try to explain this to a Suffolk County grand jury. This is gonna be fun.
BILLY: I am killing you.
BROWN: ( holstering his gun )
BARRIGAN: Did you think you were the only one he had? Costello was going to sell us to the FBI. It's you and me now. We have to take care of each other. You understand?
COLIN: All right. Give me that.
COLIN: At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who I now understand to have been Francis Costello's informer in SIU, intercepted us in the lobby and shot Trooper William Costigan once in the head. At that time Barrigan retrieved Trooper Costigan's undercover weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he was approaching our location. I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan and in the ensuing struggle was struck several times with the Walther pistol. I was able to wrestle the weapon away, at which time Barrigan drew his own weapon and took aim at me. I was able to get off a single shot, striking Barrigan in the head. I then checked for vital signs of Troopers Brown and Costigan and discovered that they had expired.
