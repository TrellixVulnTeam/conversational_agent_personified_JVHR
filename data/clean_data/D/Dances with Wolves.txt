PEPPER: They're 'sposed to be beat up just like us but everybody knows that Tucker's men are tough as cobs. I sure don't wanna die out there with them cows.
PEPPER: Some of the boys are sayin' that if we ain't gonna fight we could just settle the whole business with a little high stakes poker. Wouldn't that be a sight. a bunch of fellas sittin' in the middle of this field drawin' cards.
RAY: A man in a slouch hat crowned by a jaunty feather looks up from an impromptu meeting. TUCKER.

DUNBAR: Where can I find Major. Fambrough?

DUNBAR: Dunbar stops and turns, peering down the hallway. No one is INT. FAMBROUGH'S OFFICE - DAY Sitting behind the desk, holding a set of orders is MAJOR
FAMBROUGH: Lt. John J. Dunbar.
DUNBAR: Yes sir?
FAMBROUGH: Indian fighter, huh?
DUNBAR: Excuse me?
FAMBROUGH: ( indicating paper ) Your orders say you are to be posted on the frontier. The frontier is Indian country. I quickly deduced that you are an Indian fighter.
FAMBROUGH: I did not ascend to this position by being stupid.
DUNBAR: No sir.
FAMBROUGH: It says here you've been decorated.
DUNBAR: Yes sir.
FAMBROUGH: And they sent you out here to be Actually sir, I'm here at my own request. I want to see the frontier.
DUNBAR: Actually sir, I'm here at my own request. I want to see the frontier.
FAMBROUGH: You want to see the frontier?

FAMBROUGH: Such a smart lad coming straight to
FAMBROUGH: Sir Knight, I am sending you on a knight's errand. You will report to Captain Cargill at the furthermost outpost of the realm. Fort

DUNBAR: I'm wondering sir, how will I be getting there?
FAMBROUGH: You think I don't know?
DUNBAR: No sir, it's just that I don't know.
FAMBROUGH: Hold your tongue.
FAMBROUGH: I'm in a generous mood and will grant your boon. You see that peasant. he calls himself Timmons. he leaves this very afternoon for your Fort Sedgewick. Ride with him if you like. he knows the way. That is

ELGIN: It's alright Major.
SERGEANT: Leave him alone lieutenant. he's

ELGIN: Don't sergeant.
FAMBROUGH: Are you deaf fool. I said I'll have my crown this instant. this instant!

FAMBROUGH: The king is dead. long live the

DUNBAR: It's going to be my post. my home.
TIMMONS: You ain't hard to please, I'll say
TIMMONS: Look yonder.
TIMMONS: Somebody back east is sayin'. "why don't he write?" Stupid bastard.
CARGILL: Corporal Guest. Corporal Guest. Corporal Guest. Corporal Guest, you don't have to talk to me. just please come out.
CARGILL: It's the end. assemble the men in front of my quarters.
CARGILL: You hate me. but I feel none of the same for you. you men stayed. You stayed after they took all our horses. You stayed after all the others deserted. You stayed on the promise that the army would resupply us. I've looked for that wagon from Fort Hays just as you have. day after miserable day. All I can say is that I'm proud of you. Get your things men, we're leaving this place. The army. can go to hell.
DUNBAR: Timmons. Timmons.
DUNBAR: The teamster comes awake with a squeal, he joins Dunbar staring up at the circling birds.
DUNBAR: Something's out there.
TIMMONS: Somethin' dead.
DUNBAR: Might have a look.
TIMMONS: Might stay clear of whatever did the
DUNBAR: How come we haven't seen any buffalo?
TIMMONS: Can't figger the stinkin' buffalo. Sometimes you don't see 'em for days, sometimes they're thick as curls on a whore.
DUNBAR: What about Indians?
TIMMONS: Goddamn Indians you'd jus' as soon not see, lessen the bastards're dead. Nothing but thieves and beggars.
TIMMONS: Not what you'd call a going concern.
TIMMONS: Ain't nothin' here lieutenant.
DUNBAR: Alright.lets unload the wagon.
TIMMONS: What, and leave it all here?
DUNBAR: I'm staying too. we don't know what's happened.
TIMMONS: There ain't nothin' here lieutenant.
DUNBAR: Not at the moment, no.
TIMMONS: So things bein' the way they are we might as well turn around and get started back.
DUNBAR: This is my post.
TIMMONS: This is my. are you crazy boy?
DUNBAR: This is my post! And these are the post's provisions. Now get your ass off that wagon and help me unload.
TIMMONS: Well. I'll let 'em know where you Good luck lieutenant.
DUNBAR: Good luck lieutenant.
TIMMONS: Good luck lieutenant.
DUNBAR: Thank you.
DUNBAR: Damn. damn.
THE TOUGHEST: Only a white man would make a fire for everyone to see.
1ST PAWNEE: Maybe there's more than one.
2ND PAWNEE: We have no rifles. White men are sure to have rifles.
3RD PAWNEE: We should forget this and go home.
TOUGHEST: Then go. I for one, will not debate the merit of a single line of smoke in my own country.
1ST PAWNEE: ( shaking his head ) He will not quit until we are all
DUNBAR: You there!
TEN BEARS: Kicking Bird has been keeping to himself these last few days. I do not like to see our medicine man walking so alone.
TEN BEARS: What does his wife say?
PRETTY SHIELD: He is keeping to himself.
PRETTY SHIELD: That's what she says.
TEN BEARS: Make sure that meat is soft. my teeth hurt.
TEN BEARS: May I come in?
TEN BEARS: No, no let him sit with me.
TEN BEARS: Our country seems good this summer, but I have not been out to see it.
KICKING BIRD: Yes. it is good. The grass is rich. The game is plenty and not running I am glad to hear it. But the buffalo are late. I always worry about the bellies of our children.
TEN BEARS: I am glad to hear it. But the buffalo are late. I always worry about the bellies of our children.
KICKING BIRD: I was thinking of a dance.
TEN BEARS: Yes, a dance is always a good idea. It would be good to have a strong There's a funny thing about signs. They are always flying in our faces. We know when they are bad or good but sometimes they are strange and there is no way to understand them. Sometimes they make people crazy but a smart man will take such a sign into himself and let it run around for two or three days. If he is still confused he will tell somebody. He might come to you or to me and tell it. A smart man always does that. I have seen such a sign.
KICKING BIRD: TEN BEARS KICKING BIRD

He might come to you or to me and tell it. A smart man always does that. I have seen such a sign.
KICKING BIRD: I have seen such a sign.
TEN BEARS: KICKING BIRD
KICKING BIRD: I saw a man, a white man.
TEN BEARS: Just one?
KICKING BIRD: Just one. He was naked.
TEN BEARS: Are you sure it was a man?
KICKING BIRD: I saw his sex.
TEN BEARS: Did you speak to him?
KICKING BIRD: Ten Bears rubs at his old eyes with both hands.
TEN BEARS: We will council on this.
KICKING BIRD: He might be a god or he might be a special chief that's why we are thinking of having a talk with him.
KICKING BIRD: You are right, we need meat today and tomorrow. But we must also have meat in ten years.
KICKING BIRD: But the whites are coming. Our friends the Shoshone and the Kiowa, even our enemies, agree on this the whites are coming. More than can be counted.
KICKING BIRD: Wind In His Hair has spoken straight, his words are strong and I have heard them. It's true the whites are a poor race and it's hard to understand them. But when I see one white man alone, without fear in our country, I do not think he is lost. I think he may have medicine. I see someone who might speak for all the white people who are coming. I think this is a person with which treaties might be struck.
TEN BEARS: It is easy to become confused by these questions. It is hard to know what to do. No man can tell another how he will be. But I know this. killing a white man is a delicate matter. If you kill one, more are sure to come. We should talk about this some more.
WORM: Otter doesn't want to go.
OTTER: SMILES A LOT
OTTER: Who gets the white god horse?
OTTER: I have him.
OTTER: I don't know. My arm doesn't work.
OTTER: It was your idea.
OTTER: ( to Worm ) You're not hurt. I'm hurt.
WORM: I will be when my father finds out, his bow will be across my back.
COURIER: The party that went against the Pawnee is coming in.
COURIER: There are many hearts on the ground.
DUNBAR: She's still backing down the hill, her steps a little faster now. He's following her at a walk.
DUNBAR: Wait. you're hurt.
DUNBAR: Let me help you.
DUNBAR: You're hurt. you need help.
DUNBAR: She's hurt.
KICKING BIRD: The soldier did not come to fight he is going away and we will let
TEN BEARS: I am in agreement with Kicking Bird. We will go down and talk to the white man and find out what kind of white man he is.
TEN BEARS: I will not go. you will go. you and Kicking Bird. That is all I have to say.
DUNBAR: ( gesturing at them ) Come. please. sit down.
DUNBAR: Would you like some coffee? Coffee?
DUNBAR: I'll get some cups.
DUNBAR: Is the coffee not good? Too strong maybe? Here.
DUNBAR: ( to Kicking Bird ) Do you want some?
DUNBAR: So what are you guys doing? Looking for buffalo? He's a good one. good horse. My
DUNBAR: He's a good one. good horse. My
DUNBAR: Good horse.
DUNBAR: My horse. You see any buffalo?
DUNBAR: Wait just a bit.
KICKING BIRD: ( incorrectly in Sioux ) ( slowly ) ( getting it right )
DUNBAR: ( incorrectly in Sioux ) ( slowly ) ( getting it right )
KICKING BIRD: ( slowly ) ( getting it right )
DUNBAR: ( getting it right )
DUNBAR: EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY Dunbar is watching Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair walk their horses up the ridge to meet the waiting escort. Each horse has a gift of coffee and sugar slung over its withers. Occasionally, Wind In His Hair dips a hand into one of the bags and carefully licks each finger. Dunbar waves up at them but there is no response.
KICKING BIRD: Have you seen any buffalo?
DUNBAR: No, I haven't seen any buffalo. Are you hungry? I have food. are you
ESCORT 1: He waved.
KICKING BIRD: We will talk awhile.
KICKING BIRD: Your wounds are healing well?
KICKING BIRD: You are happy here, with my family?
KICKING BIRD: Perhaps you will marry again when the time is right.
KICKING BIRD: We have word from many places that the whites are.
KICKING BIRD: They are coming into everyone's country. They will soon be in ours I think. This white man who lives at the old soldier fort, the one who calls himself loo ten tant. I have visited him and I believe his heart is a good one. He knows things about the whites which we do not.
KICKING BIRD: He is only one man.
KICKING BIRD: Every warrior in camp would fight them if they tried.
KICKING BIRD: I cannot make the white man talk. Loo ten tant does not know Sioux.
KICKING BIRD: You have a certain medicine which no other Sioux man or woman has.
KICKING BIRD: I do not ask this for myself. I ask this for all our people.
KICKING BIRD: I want you to try and remember the the word.
KICKING BIRD: You don't want to know.
BLACK SHAWL: Will she make the white words?
KICKING BIRD: Perhaps I am asking too much.
VOICE: EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY ( FLASHBACK ) A little girl of seven, CHRISTINE, is lying in the grass of a sod roof. Next to her is ten year-old WILLIE. They are planning their wedding and staring up at the sky. Like many youngsters she's not eager to heed the persistent call of her mother.
CHRISTINE: I'm right here mother.
MOTHER: Get inside both of you.
CHRISTINE: Just do what I. oh God! Stay where you are. Keep down do you hear me?
MOTHER: Just do what I. oh God! Stay where you are. Keep down do you hear me?
CHRISTINE: Who is it Willie?
WILLIE: They look like Pawnee. my father and your father are talking to them.
WILLIE: Run Christine.
CHRISTINE: Just run!
WILLIE: Just run!
WILLIE: Christine runs past the point where the roof meets the natural hillside and down into the draw. She's running toward us. In the background we can see Willie on the edge of the roof, aiming his squirrel gun into the yard. He fires once, then grasping the gun like a club, he leaps off the roof and Christine never looks back. She runs up the draw as fast as her skinny young legs can carry her.
CHRISTINE: Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the lord my soul to keep. If I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take.
DUNBAR: Kicking Bird doesn't understand or can't hear. He brings his face close to Dunbar's.
DUNBAR: ( making horns with his fingers ) Yes. Buffalo.
KICKING BIRD: Yes. Buffalo.
DUNBAR: Yes. Buffalo.
KICKING BIRD: The buffalo have come.
CHRISTINE: She listens. The hoofbeats are gone.
CHRISTINE: ( louder ) Help me. ( screaming ) Please. I need to get out.
DUNBAR: I wish I knew what to say.
DUNBAR: Thank you.
DUNBAR: Look I'm full. I can't tell the story again.
DUNBAR: Go ahead.
DUNBAR: ( signing ) You want to try. put it on.
DUNBAR: He sloughs off the tunic and hands it over. Wind In His Hair slips out of the magnificent bone-pipe breastplate he's wearing and gives it to Dunbar as he wriggles into the tunic. The fit is too tight, the material too scratchy but those things are of little consequence to Wind In His Hair. He loves the tunic. With urging signs he asks the lieutenant to put on the breastplate. Dunbar slips it over his head and Wind In His Hair helps him with the ties. Now it's the lieutenant's turn to be amazed. The breastplate as craftsmanship at its finest. He runs his fingers over the ridges of bone now covering him from neck to waist. He looks up at Wind In His Hair. The warrior nods approvingly, as though a good deal has heen But for Wind In His Hair it is already a trade. Wind In His Hair spots the next fireside and veers toward it. Dunbar holds him back.
DUNBAR: This is too much. I can't take
DUNBAR: I can't. No more.
DUNBAR: I can't, I'm full. very full.
DUNBAR: That's my hat.
DUNBAR: My hat.
BIG WARRIOR: I found it on the prairie. It's mine.
BIG WARRIOR: He left it on the prairie. He didn't want it.
DUNBAR: Yes, it's good. But, I have to sleep.
KICKING BIRD: Where is loo ten tant?
KICKING BIRD: Does it scratch the skin?
DUNBAR: They asked me to dance.
DUNBAR: I was just dancing.
DUNBAR: Go home.
DUNBAR: Damn him.
DUNBAR: C'mon Two Socks. you can't go. so go home. Alright then, don't go home. But stay. stay right here.
DUNBAR: Alright then, don't go home. But stay. stay right here.
DUNBAR: You go home.
STONE CALF: You were right about loo ten tant he is a special white man.
KICKING BIRD: Yes, he is special. he should have a real name.
KICKING BIRD: I know.
KICKING BIRD: We were waiting for you.
KICKING BIRD: ( to Dunbar ) Welcome. It is good that you are
DUNBAR: Thank you. I feel good.
KICKING BIRD: Ask him why he is at the soldier Uhh. you. come.
DUNBAR: Wait. what is your name?
KICKING BIRD: What does he say?
KICKING BIRD: Ahhh. He's right. I'm sorry.
DUNBAR: STANDS WITH A FIST
DUNBAR: STANDS WITH A FIST
DUNBAR: ( to Kicking Bird ) Kicking Bird. ( to Stands With A Fist ) What does he. is he a chief?
DUNBAR: ( glancing at Kicking Bird )
DUNBAR: ( to Stands With A Fist ) Your name. you.
DUNBAR: Up? Get up?
DUNBAR: Her smile is a little wider this time.
DUNBAR: Stands With A.
DUNBAR: She nods.
DUNBAR: Stands With A Fist. I'm John. John John Dunbar.
DUNBAR: EXT. VILLAGE - DAY Kicking Bird and Dunbar are strolling through camp engaged in a real conversation, Stands With A Fist is just behind Kicking Bird and Stands With A Fist are walking away from Dunbar, who takes a few steps in the opposite direction before pausing. Toward the end of the following speech he glances back at them and Stands With A Fist glances back at him.
DUNBAR: I'm glad to see you. please sit.
DUNBAR: They are Sioux enemies.
DUNBAR: I asked that he would think about my He has.
DUNBAR: Then tell him this. I have been a warrior for longer than many of the young men that will go on this war party. Tell him.
DUNBAR: I know, I understand. But I cannot learn these ways in camp.
DUNBAR: I will be happy to watch over your He thanks Dances With Wolves for Who is Dances With Wolves?
DUNBAR: Who is Dances With Wolves?
DUNBAR: Dances With Wolves. that's right. How do you say it?
DUNBAR: ( in Sioux to Kicking Bird ) Dances With Wolves.
KICKING BIRD: ( to Stands With A Fist ) Keep on with the white man talk if it pleases you.
LITTLE BOY: What are you doing here? It is hot. We are sitting in the
LITTLE BOY: I'm hungry.
BLACK SHAWL: How is Dances With Wolves?
BLACK SHAWL: How is he learning?
BLACK SHAWL: You are not talking today?
STONE CALF: Some of your words are wrong. but you are learning fast. That is good. What can I tell you today?
STONE CALF: What is your question?
STONE CALF: She is in mourning.
STONE CALF: She is crying for someone.
STONE CALF: It is not polite to speak of the dead. But I will tell you. you are new. She cries for her husband. He was killed not long ago.
STONE CALF: It is Kicking Bird's place to say when she is finished.
BLACK SHAWL: People are talking about you.
BLACK SHAWL: They are proud of the medicine you are making with Dances With Wolves.
BLACK SHAWL: You can't, he is gone.
WORM: We got a snake.
OTTER: We're gonna see if it can swim the river. You wanna come?
STONE CALF: The Pawnee do not come for horses, they come for blood. and with many men gone, we are few.
STONE CALF: Get your weapons and come to my lodge.
TEN BEARS: No, the ride is long. the weather is bad. We can spare no men.
TEN BEARS: Take one man and go quickly.
TEN BEARS: Hear us now. A white soldier with many far-shooting guns. how would he fight the Pawnee?
TEN BEARS: Dances With Wolves has not finished.
TEN BEARS: I am of the same mind as Dances With Wolves. we should kill so many that they never trouble us again.
SIOUX 1: I killed this one.
SIOUX 2: This one still breathes.
1ST WARRIOR: Yes, I saw you shoot him.
2ND WARRIOR: You killed that one too.
BLACK SHAWL: How long will Stands With A Fist
KICKING BIRD: I don't know.
BLACK SHAWL: I hope it will not be too long.
KICKING BIRD: Something has happened? Well what?
BLACK SHAWL: She has found love again.
KICKING BIRD: With who?
BLACK SHAWL: Dances With Wolves.
KICKING BIRD: Are you certain of this?
BLACK SHAWL: When you see them together you will
KICKING BIRD: What are people saying? They're not No. They like the match. It makes sense. They are both white.
BLACK SHAWL: No. They like the match. It makes sense. They are both white.
KICKING BIRD: I suppose I will be the one to say
BLACK SHAWL: She's your daughter now.
BLACK SHAWL: You can't see everything coming.
KICKING BIRD: Stands With A Fist.
KICKING BIRD: You are no longer a widow.
KICKING BIRD: This is a good day for me.
KICKING BIRD: Stands With A Fist. if you want this man, take his hand in yours. I had never been married before. I don't know if all grooms have the same experience. But as Kicking Bird began to speak about what was expected of a Sioux husband, my mind began to swim in a way that shut out everything but her. The tiny details of her costume. The contours of her shape. The light in her eyes. The smallness of her feet. I knew that the love between us would be served. Have you heard all that I have said?
KICKING BIRD: Have you heard all that I have said?
KICKING BIRD: Good, then take her inside. she is your wife.
WORM: Dances With Wolves' door is closed alot these days.
OTTER: I know that.
WORM: Maybe they're having a hard time. Some people have a hard time.
OTTER: Me neither.
OTTER: Maybe we should pull the smoke flap closed. Then they would come out.
KICKING BIRD: Dances With Wolves, are you in there?
KICKING BIRD: I am riding today to a far away place. It is a place I haven't seen for a long time. A sacred place. I would like you to come with me.
KICKING BIRD: Yes it must be.
KICKING BIRD: No waiting?
KICKING BIRD: I was just thinking that of all the trails in this life, there is one that matters more than all the others. It is the trail of a true human being. I think you are on this trail and it is good to see.
KICKING BIRD: It is said that all the animals were born here. that from here they spread over the prairies to feed all the people. Even our enemies say this is a sacred place.
KICKING BIRD: No, they've been gone a week maybe more. we will water the horses and go home.
KICKING BIRD: Help me to know how many.
TEN BEARS: It's hard to know what to do. The men who wore this came in the time of my grandfather's grandfather. Eventually, we drove them out. Then the Mexicans came. In my own time the whites came. the Texans. They have been like all the others who find something they want in our country. They take it without asking. I have always been a peaceful man, happy to be in my own country and wanting nothing from the white people. Nothing at all. But I think you are right. I think they will keep coming. When I think of that, I look at this bundle. Our country is all that we want. We will fight to keep it.

TEN BEARS: Tomorrow morning we will strike the village and go to the winter camp.
KICKING BIRD: We cannot wait for you.
KICKING BIRD: Something has happened. Dances With Wolves is not coming.
KICKING BIRD: Pick two good men with fast ponies and send them back to the soldier
BAUER: A pitiful looking man, SPIVEY, who is a soldier by name only, answers up.
SPIVEY: Yessir sergeant.
SERGEANT BAUER: Tell the major he's wakin' up. and move your worthless ass.

ELGIN: Why are you out of uniform?
BAUER: Lieutenant's askin' the questions
ELGIN: We are charged with apprehending hostiles, recovering stolen property and retrieving white captives taken in hostile raidings.
MAJOR: We will ascertain that for ourselves. Now if you guide us to these camps and serve as an interpreter, your conduct will be reevaluated.
MAJOR: Your status as a traitor might improve should you choose to cooperate with the United States Army.
ELGIN: Are you willing to cooperate or not?
MAJOR: Well, speak up.
MAJOR: What's that?
ELGIN: Sergeant. have a detail take him down to the river. let him clean up his face.
SPIVEY: What's it to you?
CRAPPER: Well gimme some shitbird.
SPIVEY: Can you read?
CRAPPER: Naw, I can't read. What the hell do you care. you can't either.
SPIVEY: Alright. hold your horses.
SERGEANT BAUER: Lap it up Injun.
SERGEANT BAUER: Go on ahead Injun. You'll just get hungrier is all. but mebbe that don't matter. Word is they're gonna ship you back to Hays. And they'll hang you once you get there.
SPIVEY: I don't see nobody.
SPIVEY: Lookit the stupid bastard. he ain't even runnin'.
BAUER: Don't shoot, I seen 'em first. it's my shot.
DRIVER: It's my shot goddamit.
SPIVEY: You dumb sons a bitches.
BAUER: He mighta killed you.
SOLDIER 1: I got him.
SOLDIER 2: The hell you did.
SOLDIER 1: I got him. dead shot boys.

SOLDIER: All clear lieutenant.
TEN BEARS: ( to Dances With Wolves ) Dances With Wolves is quiet these Is his heart bad?
TEN BEARS: Is his heart bad?
TEN BEARS: Quiet!. sit down Wind In His Hair. You are hurting an old man's ears with your loud talk.
TEN BEARS: Ahh. this is a nice fire. at my age a good fire is better than
TEN BEARS: I wondered how your bad heart was doing and though I would come by and see for myself. This place doesn't look so bad-hearted.
TEN BEARS: But you are leaving anyway?
TEN BEARS: Have you told this to Kicking Bird or to Wind In His Hair. You are the only white man I have ever known. I have thought about you alot. More than you know.
TEN BEARS: You are the only white man I have ever known. I have thought about you alot. More than you know.
TEN BEARS: You have always spoken with your heart. And like all of us, you are a free man and can do anything you like. When I look across this fire, I do not see a white soldier. I see only a Sioux named Dances With Wolves. And there is nothing they hate so much as a Sioux.
TEN BEARS: You are making a pipe?
TEN BEARS: This might be a pretty good pipe. how does it smoke?
TEN BEARS: Let's smoke it awhile. it is good to pass the time this way.
KICKING BIRD: You've finished your pipe? How does it smoke?
KICKING BIRD: It doesn't seem possible that we could come this far.
