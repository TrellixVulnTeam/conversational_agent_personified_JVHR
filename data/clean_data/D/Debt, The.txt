THE DEBT: Written by
STEPHAN: He stands. Rachel turns to look at David but he is standing too, his face a mask. Rachel gathers herself, then stands and turns to follow the other two, walking towards the light. As the three approach the opening and descend the ramp of the bay door, we hear a woman's voice:
RACHEL'S P.O.V: Silhouetted against the bright light is a group of waiting MILITARY and MOSSAD DIGNITARIES. Their hands are raised in The three walk towards their welcoming party. Rachel blinks against the sunlight, takes out a pair of sunglasses and slips them on.
REVERSE: Rachel's daughter - SARAH - stands at a podium, reading the Dedication to a rather large audience who have come for the launch of her first book. She's 31, and clearly her mother's daughter. The cover image from the book is projected on a screen behind Sarah - a black and white photograph of a young Rachel, David and Stephan. Above their faces, the title - In Our Hands.
SARAH: Their mission had been to return him to Israel to stand trial. Instead it ended with his death on the streets of East Berlin.
YOUNG AGENT: David Peretz?
DAVID: YOUNG AGENT
YOUNG AGENT: You were expecting me?
DAVID: Yes. I was expecting you.
YOUNG AGENT: Would you come with me sir?
DAVID: Let's go.
DAVID: ( Indistinctly )
YOUNG AGENT: What, sir?
DAVID: ( Beat ) I - I think I.
SARAH: When are you going to stop?
RACHEL: Stop what?
SARAH: The smoking.
RACHEL: I hope so. Do it for your Are you sure you have to go back home tomorrow?
SARAH: I hope so. Do it for your Are you sure you have to go back home tomorrow?
SARAH: Are you sure you have to go back home tomorrow?
RACHEL: It's all arranged, I'm afraid.
SARAH: But we'll have breakfast before you go? I thought maybe we could take a walk on the beach? ( Trying to sound casual ) I'd like you to see more of him. Well, I'll be back. We can.maybe in the holidays or.
RACHEL: ( To Sarah, ill-at-ease ) Well, I'll be back. We can.maybe in the holidays or.
MIRIAM: I've marked the place. I thought perhaps from chapter eleven.?
RACHEL: .Yes, thank you.
SARAH: If you'd rather read something else, mother...
RACHEL: No, that's fine. You must be very proud. .It's a wonderful achievement. I'm very proud of her.
MIRIAM: You must be very proud. .It's a wonderful achievement. I'm very proud of her.
RACHEL: ( A little automatic ) .It's a wonderful achievement. I'm very proud of her.
MIRIAM: And I'm sure you were invaluable in the research.
SARAH: ( Keeping it light ) Actually, my mother withstood all interrogation. My father was the talker. ( Trying a joke ) I'm the only journalist in Israel she won't speak to.
RACHEL: I thought he couldn't come.
SARAH: ( Standing up, surprised ) So did I.
STEPHAN: ( To the politicos ) Please, sit, sit. My God, it must be election season.
SARAH: You came.
STEPHAN: I came. So you're the famous author I've heard so much about?
RACHEL: ( To Sarah ) Now you're the expert, maybe you could tell me something. ( Pointing to himself ) Who's this handsome devil on the cover?
STEPHAN: ( To Sarah ) Now you're the expert, maybe you could tell me something. ( Pointing to himself ) Who's this handsome devil on the cover?
SARAH'S HUSBAND: She was wonderful.
STEPHAN: That's good. Good, good. That's very good.
MIRIAM: I just want thank you all for coming to help us celebrate the launch of this wonderful book. I'm sure we're all particularly thrilled to have two of the heroes of this story at the table. And even more thrilled that one of them has agreed to read for us.
RACHEL: ( reading ) "On the evening of the 31st of December, it began to rain more heavily. So isolated had they become from the outside world that it was only when she looked out of the window that Rachel remembered it was New Year's
RACHEL'S P.O.V: There is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a moment we see Vogel lit, about to make it to the gate and disappear forever.
RACHEL: ( Of the driver ) He's driving too fast.
STEPHAN: We're going to David's apartment.
RACHEL: I keep track of people Rachel. It's my job. ( Beat ) I know he came to see you yesterday.
STEPHAN: I keep track of people Rachel. It's my job. ( Beat ) I know he came to see you yesterday.
RACHEL: ( contemptuous ) What's this? The jealous ex- husband or the intelligence A little of both. What did he Fuck you.
STEPHAN: A little of both. What did he Fuck you.
RACHEL: Fuck you.
STEPHAN: What did he tell you?
RACHEL: He didn't tell me anything. ( Off his look ) He didn't! He told me where he'd been travelling, that he'd been teaching. We spoke for a few minutes and then I had to go.
RACHEL: Why did he do it?
REVERSE: Rachel sits at a table with Stephan, watching her daughter. Stephan takes out an ENVELOPE and passes it to her. She opens it and examines the contents - an AIR-PLANE TICKET and TWO PASSPORTS. Stephan takes out a small BLACK CASE and slides it across the table towards her. She turns to look at it with disgust, KNOWING WHAT IT IS. Then she takes it and puts it in her handbag.
STEPHAN: My car's waiting outside. It can take you to the airport.
PULLING RACHEL: .as she walks from the bright light of the patio into the relative darkness of the hotel lobby, suitcase in hand, face set, steely.
PAST: .the passport again. We're now looking at the black and white image of YOUNG RACHEL. The name beneath it is ELSA
RACHEL'S P.O.V: A CROWD of people are waiting beyond the check-point for their loved ones. They're all looking eagerly at us. Only one YOUNG MAN has his back to us, turning away to light a Then he turns - Young David - a fine, sensitive face, darkly shadowed eyes. This is the SHOT we saw earlier. A moment when we see how anxious he is to play his part right. Then he smiles his beautiful smile.
DAVID: ( In German ) How was your trip?
RACHEL: ( German ) Fine. Everyone sends their love.
DAVID: You've cut your hair.
HIGH ANGLE: David takes her suitcase, and they begin to walk away, hand in hand, along the BERLIN WALL. Rachel nods, embarrassed.
DAVID: I'm David.
RACHEL: 42 EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY 42
RACHEL: Where do I sleep?
STEPHAN: You're in my room.
STEPHAN: What do you think of your new

STEPHAN: David shrugs.
DAVID: ( examining the steel ) I don't know.
STEPHAN: Two years. All the places we've been to. You don't look at women. Before I get into that bed, is there anything you have to tell
STEPHAN: Well, well.I think he just
STEPHAN: Rachel nods and they change places. David picks up the knife and repeats the "attack" move on her. She disarms him David takes his position, grabbing Rachel from behind, but he's so awkward with her the attack seems a little Stephan talks as Rachel practises breaking free from the

VOGEL: And how long have you and your husband been trying for a baby?
RACHEL: Nearly two years.
VOGEL: Uhuh. Well, the ovaries look fine. Alright, let's see. your cervix is slightly retroverted. Tilted backwards?
RACHEL: The angle from which we next see VOGEL, and the way the image of his face freezes in black and white, tells us clearly that this locket conceals a CAMERA DEVICE.
VOGEL: Mmm. But that generally shouldn't affect fertility.
RACHEL: Oh, good.
VOGEL: You have a slight accent, Frau Roget. Where are you from?
RACHEL: Argentina. We just moved here. A few months ago.
VOGEL: Whereabouts in Argentina? Buenos Oh, Buenos Aires. Beautiful. I went once, when I was young. We went to the Opera house I remember. What's it called again?

HIGH SHOT: As Stephan races up some steps, along a balcony, and into the building.
TRACKING: with Stephan through the hallway, out of the door and onto the street..
NURSE: ( to no one in Oh god! Come on, come on! Hurry!

NURSE: Thank you.thank you.
RACHEL: You should get your things, go to the hospital to meet him.
STEPHAN: ( Tense ) I know, I know.
HIGH ANGLE: The depot car park is dark - rows of postal vans parked up. An eerie silence. Through the high fence behind the vans we can make out the tracks and dimly lit STATION PLATFORM beyond - GUARDS patrolling in the little pools of light. As we watch a POSTAL WORKER comes out of the depot and walks through the carpark and out of the gate, his shift 106 INSIDE THE VAN 106 P.O.V - THROUGH VAN WINDSCREEN We're watching the WORKER walk in front of us and leave the car park. In the dark of the back of the van, Rachel crouches, watching him leave. She turns back to where Stephan and David wait by the van doors, bolt cutters in their hands. On the floor of the van lies Vogel's unconscious form. They wait in absolute silence, listening to the fading footsteps of the worker. David checks his watch, holds up a single finger to Stephan. Moments later we hear the sound of an approaching
STEPHAN: ( Softly ) One, two, three, four, five,
STEPHAN: ( As he runs ) Twenty, twenty one, twenty two.
WORKER: You new?
RACHEL: First shift. The girls said it was okay to come out for a Yeah, it's okay. Are you working until midnight?
WORKER: Yeah, it's okay. Are you working until midnight?
RACHEL: After the late shift most of us go to the Vetter. Do you know it?
WORKER: After the late shift most of us go to the Vetter. Do you know it?
WORKER: .it's just on the corner. You should come along.
DRIVER: There's something on the tracks up here!
RACHEL: Well, maybe I'll see you there? I finish in half an hour. Why don't you go and get me a drink ready?
WORKER: Half an hour then.
WORKER: What was that.?
DAVID: ( Softly )
RACHEL: I think it came from over here?
WORKER: No, it was one of those. Stay where you are!
BORDER GUARD: There's nothing there. Get moving
FIRST GUARD: What are you doing here?
RACHEL: I work here. I'm on a break.
FIRST GUARD: Show me your papers, both of you.
STEPHAN: ( hissing ) We have to go!
STEPHAN: We can make it. Help me with You can go.
FIRST GUARD: ( Handing them back ) You can go.
STEPHAN: ( Hissing ) We're going! Now!
DAVID: Not without her.
SECOND GUARD: ( Startled ) Hey! Over here!
ON RACHEL: and the van begins to reverse with a scream of tyres towards Rachel. The Guards at the side-gate open fire on the van hurtling towards them, bullets pocking the rear doors. The side door is flung open and Rachel dives in, just as Stephan roars forward again.
STEPHAN: The three duck as the Guard fires, punching a neat hole in the windscreen. Seconds later the van thuds into him, sending him flying.
STEPHAN'S P.O.V: On the road ahead a Border Guard Jeep appears, driving directly towards them. Stephan has no choice - he floors it. At the last second the jeep tries to pull right but the van catches its rear side and barrels straight through, the jeep spinning off and smashing into the wall.
STEPHAN: Is he dead? ( Beat ) Is he dead?
RACHEL: The Guard! The one who saw your face! Is he dead?
STEPHAN: The Guard! The one who saw your face! Is he dead?
RACHEL: Stephen's grim silence says everything. He glances back at the unconscious Vogel lying between the other two.
STEPHAN: How did he come round? How the fuck did he come round? You gave him the full injection?
STEPHAN: Did you give him the.
RACHEL: I don't know! I thought I.
STEPHAN: Jesus Christ!
STEPHAN: We could have gone!
DAVID: It's not over.
STEPHEN: We could have fucking.!
DAVID: WE STILL HAVE HIM! IT'S NOT OVER! We still have him.
RACHEL'S P.O.V: .three POTS have been placed under drips from the ceiling inside the room. We hear the three distinct notes of the water drops. Rachel stares dully at the water dripping, feeling exhausted and numb. A key scrapes and Rachel turns to the door as Stephan and David walk in, hair soaked from the rain.
RACHEL: ( Standing up ) What did he say?
RACHEL: You made contact?
RACHEL: What did he say?
DAVID: It's going to take time. They need to open up a new route, they need to find political help. Maybe the Americans. Two weeks. maybe three.
DAVID: We work four shifts guarding him. We feed him at the end of each shift. We never leave him alone.
STEPHAN: ( turns to Rachel, hard ) And you're compromised. You don't leave the fucking house.
DAVID: We can do this. We just need to stay focussed.
VOGEL: ( In German ) ...Fucking assholes! Fucking pig shit food! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck.
BEDROOM: He continues to swear at his captors as best he can through his gag. Rachel tries to block out the sound with her 133 KITCHEN 133 Rachel walks in and finds a flushed David wiping oatmeal off his trousers, the empty bowl on the bench beside him.
DAVID: ( Off her look ) At this rate he's going to starve himself to death before we can get him back.
VOGEL: My wife.
STEPHAN: You can't talk to him.
RACHEL: I didn't say anything.
STEPHAN: You can't listen to him.
RACHEL: I know. I just.
STEPHAN: ( overlapping ) I'm not angry -
RACHEL: He smiles, stares at her, moves a little closer but Rachel has already side-stepped him and walked away.
MONTAGE: 136 LIVING ROOM - DAY 136
STEPHAN: Stephan drops Vogel in disgust jumping back out of the way. Vogel lies in the pool, staring up at him, eyes triumphant.
VOGEL: Why don't you just kill me now?
VOGEL: I know what you want. You want to hand me over to the others, let there be some fucking sham of a trial. Then, when they kill me, you can tell yourself that there was no blood on your hands. But that isn't true. There will be blood on your hands.
VOGEL: I was dreaming about my wife.
DAVID: What happened? What's the matter?
RACHEL: Nothing. He.nothing.
DAVID: He can understand every word we're saying. He just spoke to
RACHEL: He can understand every word we're saying. He just spoke to
DAVID: It's alright. It's alright. It's nearly over.
RACHEL: ( Suddenly ) Why didn't you go? At the station. You could have got away. Why didn't you?
DAVID: It's not happening.
STEPHAN: It's not happening.
DAVID: What the fuck does that mean?
STEPHAN: The Americans have pulled out. ( To Rachel ) Has he been fed?
DAVID: So.so what does that mean?
RACHEL: Oh God.
STEPHAN: Did you feed him?
DAVID: What does that mean? What's the plan now?
RACHEL: ( rising panic ) We just need to get him to the airfield, there must be some other way, some.
STEPHAN: I said has he.? I'm asking you.
DAVID: ( overlapping ) I'm asking you.
STEPHAN: ( overlapping ) I'm talking to her! Supposedly it's her shift now, but instead of doing what she's supposed to be doing she's out here with you! ( To Rachel ) Now answer the fucking question: Did you feed YES! I fed him!
RACHEL: YES! I fed him!
STEPHAN: ( Beat ) There's no plan. There's no fucking plan. They said the operation is being "re-
STEPHAN: You know what that means? They're going to cut us loose.
STEPHAN: It's a fucking mess and they're backing away from it quickly as they can.
STEPHAN: It's happening. I can feel it.
RACHEL: They can't just leave us!
STEPHAN: Yes they can! Because we fucked it all up! We fucked it all up and now we're on our own!
DAVID: Were you followed?
RACHEL: Stephan is hurriedly screwing the SILENCER onto the GUN. There's another KNOCK at the door.
STEPHAN: If it's them, he dies.
DAVID: You're not doing this.
STEPHAN: He's not getting away from me.
DAVID: This isn't the mission.
STEPHAN: I decide what the mission is! If I say he dies, he dies.
DAVID: We're finishing this mission. We're taking him back.
STEPHAN: Get out of the way!
STEPHAN: Rachel. Rachel!
RACHEL: ( Dully ) It was the lady from the bottom apartment. She invited us to her New Year's Eve party.
DAVID: What are you doing?
STEPHAN: It's your shift.
DAVID: ( To Rachel ) Did you know about this?
RACHEL: About what?
DAVID: ( To Stephan ) His mouth's taped. You want him to suffocate?
STEPHAN: I was sick of seeing his face. Go back in.
DAVID: Don't do that again.
STEPHAN: You don't give orders David. It's your shift now so you can go back in there. Stop it!
RACHEL: Stop it!
DAVID: We're not animals. Just remember what we are. Remember what we're
DAVID: What are you doing?
RACHEL: I have to get out.
DAVID: ( Gently )
RACHEL: Get out of my way, please. I'm just going to go out for a few minutes. That's all I want to
DAVID: She wants to go out.
RACHEL: ( appealing ) No one will see me. Tell him, David. I just want to walk. I just want to get some.air.
STEPHAN: Don't be stupid.
RACHEL: GET OFF ME!
VOGEL: Thank you. David.
DAVID: ( Quietly ) Shut up. I am expressing my sympathy. For your suffering.
VOGEL: I am expressing my sympathy. For your suffering.
DAVID: What does a monster like you know about suffering?
VOGEL: I'm a doctor, David.
DAVID: A doctor. ( beat )You blind children trying to change the colour of their eyes. You inject people with petrol. You.you replace people's hands and legs and you watch as they.
VOGEL: So we were all insane? Is that the answer?
DAVID: ( Beat ) There's no answer. I'm not looking for an answer. I'm not looking for.
VOGEL: You're trembling.
STEPHAN: Out. We're going out.
VOGEL: ( Mumbling, in German ) Thank you.
ON RACHEL: .as she finishes with the pots and notices the pieces of shattered bowl scattered around Vogel. She kneels down in front of him and collects up the pieces. She glances up at Vogel, checking him. He is still slumped, eyes closed. We TRACK with her as she walks back into the kitchen. From the living room comes the three distinct PINGS of rainwater dripping in the pots. She drops the pieces of bowl into the bin and stops, puzzled. It's a moment before she works out what she's noticed - something has changed in the sound of the rainwater next door. There only two drips instead of three. She walks back towards the living room. RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn but.it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's been standing in so that he is directly in front of her. Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open with a SHARD OF GLASS. Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her throat with the glass. Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face. Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden pain of the blow. Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by blood from her wound washing into her eyes. As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her face. She falls. Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards the front door. Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps free and kicks her hard in the head.
STEPHAN: Nothing. Not a trace. Nothing at
DAVID: ( Without looking up ) He's not going back to the house. He's gone. Fifteen years, it took them to find him. And he's gone. And no-one's going to find him So we what? We.are you going to make the phone call? Are you going to tell them how he got a fucking piece of broken bowl? Wonderful. But don't try and take me down with you. I've done nothing wrong. Remember that!
STEPHAN: So we what? We.are you going to make the phone call? Are you going to tell them how he got a fucking piece of broken bowl? Wonderful. But don't try and take me down with you. I've done nothing wrong. Remember that!
RACHEL: I take responsibility. It was my This happened because of me. I let him go. And no-one's ever going to find him again.
DAVID: ( Quietly ) This happened because of me. I let him go. And no-one's ever going to find him again.
STEPHAN: No-one's ever going to find him
RACHEL: What are you talking about?
STEPHAN: Only four people know what happened in this room. Us, and him. And he's not talking. No one will ever hear from him again.
RACHEL: ( Realizing what he Nobody needs to know what happened here.
STEPHAN: Nobody needs to know what happened here.
RACHEL: He escaped.
STEPHAN: That's the truth. But that doesn't have to be the truth we take home. The truth can be anything we want it to be. The truth is Vogel tried to escape, you struggled with him and got hurt. The truth is, seconds before he got away, Rachel got the gun and shot him. The truth is we got rid of him.. got rid of the body. got rid of every trace of the Surgeon of Birkenau.
RACHEL: We can't lie about this!
STEPHAN: No, you know what? We have to. We have to! This is.this isn't about us. This is about Israel. This is a national humiliation! We can't be seen to fail. And in the end, Vogel rots away his life in some jungle, looking over his shoulder, waiting for the bullet.? Who's to say.?
DAVID: He's gone. What does it matter?( Beat ) He's gone. He's right. It makes no difference. No difference. All we have to agree is that we never talk about this. No matter what happens, we never tell anyone. The truth stays in this room. Between us. Agreed?
STEPHAN: ( Seizing ) He's right. It makes no difference. No difference. All we have to agree is that we never talk about this. No matter what happens, we never tell anyone. The truth stays in this room. Between us. Agreed?
DAVID: Silence. Rachel closes her eyes. Instead of relief she feels a kind of immense disappointment.
RACHEL: Rachel? Say it. It's an oath. Say
STEPHAN: Rachel? Say it. It's an oath. Say
RACHEL: ( crying out ) How could this happen? You said he would never speak! You said he'd never.
STEPHAN: We don't know it's him.
RACHEL: Oh God! Oh God!
STEPHAN: If you read it.
RACHEL: He's alive! He's in the Ukraine! What else is there to read?
STEPHAN: This is a little internet story. ( Grabbing the paper, reading )."a psychiatric patient claiming to be the Surgeon of Birkenau." Some crazy old man. No-one is paying this any attention. Yet.
RACHEL: ( as if her mind was How did you find it?
STEPHAN: David comes back after all this time, I want to know why. I had his apartment searched. This was on his computer.
RACHEL: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 82.
STEPHAN: Because he couldn't handle it. I told him we had to deal with it and he couldn't handle it. He thought it was all going to come out and he panicked.
RACHEL: ( Suddenly ) Deal with it? ( Beat ) What does that mean? Deal with it?
STEPHAN: ( Simply ) I told him to find Vogel. I told him to finish it.
RACHEL: ( quiet rage ) Did you know he'd been ill? Did you.? You knew, didn't you? You killed him. YOU killed him! You knew he wasn't strong enough.
STEPHAN: ( overlapping ) FUCK DAVID! I don't want to hear about David! David took the coward's way out!
RACHEL: You could have left it alone! It's an old man in a hospital! You said - nobody will believe it! No-one will notice!
STEPHAN: There's a journalist.
RACHEL: What are you talking about?
STEPHAN: David's taken himself out of the equation. ( Indicating his chair ) I can't do it. You're the only one left.

STEPHAN: We can't.
RACHEL: I'm not.Look at me! I'm not capable of.This is insane. I can't do this.

RACHEL: ( after a beat, quietly ) Because we did a terrible thing..
STEPHAN: ( flat ) There you are.
INSERT SHEET: A photocopy of a JOURNALIST'S BY-LINE - a long, rather mournful face, the name YURI TITOV. She checks the face, slips the sheet back in the bag, looks up, studying the men descending towards her. Moments later she has found him - chatting to a colleague. He reaches the ground floor and walking past her, goes to the bar for a coffee. Rachel finds herself staring at him - the man WHO COULD
RACHEL: ( Russian ) Am I late? I'm sorry.. Can I place an advertisement?
RECEPTIONIST: ( gathering her things ) 100 grivna for twenty words. 5 grivna a word after that.

BOYFRIEND: You're worth it.
RECEPTIONIST: You're going to get me fired!
BOYFRIEND: ( Kissing her ) I'm worth it.
ON BOYFRIEND: .as we realise he is staring STRAIGHT THROUGH the torch, lost in the moment. Next moment the couple change positions and some books and the torch are swept from the desk and clatter to the floor. The TORCH ROLLS across the carpet to the shadowy entrance of the cubicle.
BOYFRIEND: What are you doing?
RECEPTIONIST: I'm tidying up.
BOYFRIEND: Are you working? Are you at work No, I'm not working.
RECEPTIONIST: ( Laughing ) No, I'm not working.

STUDENT: Did you think you were going to

DAVID: You look well.
RACHEL: Does Stephan know you're here?

DAVID: I travelled a lot. The States. Most of South America. North Africa.. I kept moving Looking for him
RACHEL: He doesn't answer and she looks up, suddenly realising who he means. She feels a sudden, instinctive rush of fear.
DAVID: I would have told the truth. I would have gone to the newspaper, and said "this is the Surgeon of Birkenau." I could have finally seen him face trial.
RACHEL: And what would have happened to FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 We'd be free. Whatever happened to us, it seemed to me we'd be

RACHEL: About David. You were wrong about
STEPHAN: About David?
RACHEL: When he came to see me, he was asking me for something.
RACHEL: My permission. And I didn't give it. I wouldn't let him tell the truth and he was tired of living with the lie.
STEPHAN: Truth is a luxury, Rachel. Some people have to put other things first - their country, their people.their children.
RACHEL: ( Crying ) I want her to be proud of me.
RACHEL: I want to do something to make her proud of me.
STEPHAN: Rachel.? Rachel.?
RACHEL: STEPHAN ( O.S. )
ASSISTANT: Stephan doesn't move.
LONG SHOT: From the other end of the corridor, as the small figure of Rachel steps away from the bench. She straightens her scarf and wipes her eyes, then begins to walk towards us.
PULLING RACHEL: As she moves down another corridor. She reaches an opening on her left, which reveals a STAIRCASE winding around a central lift shaft, caged in frosted glass panels. She glances through it as she passes. And just for a second we see an ELDERLY MAN walking down the stairs. Rachel has walked on a few steps before it registers, and she stops -
VOGEL: ( a dull rasp ) Why did you come.?
VOGEL: I can stop him. I won't tell him anymore. ( Almost pleading ) Nobody needs to know.
VOGEL: You Jews never knew how to kill. Only how to die.
PULLING VOGEL: .as he walks down the corridor, breathing hard, trying to make it back to his room, back to safety. Suddenly he staggers against the wall. Something's wrong, something in his back. He twists around trying to locate the source of the strange sensation. And there it is - the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE Rachel has stuck between his shoulders. He touches it with his fingertips, eyes wide with horror, feeling the rush of lethal chemicals through his blood. He twists again trying to pull the needle free but his legs are already giving way and he collapses to the floor. Moments later he's dead.
INSERT: We see the first line - "My name is Rachel Singer."
