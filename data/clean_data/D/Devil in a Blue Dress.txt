JOPPY: I didn't say that. But if there's a dollar laying in the street I don't think he'll let a little dirt stop him from picking it up. If you worried about making that house note this month, maybe you wanna pay him a call. All them pretty girls you be with ain't gonna buy you a house.
JOPPY: ( continuing ) Sound like he just wants you to keep your eyes open for somebody. He'll pay you whether you see anything or not. If it was me I'd take that man's money and go on about my bidness. Ain't nothin' to worry about. When somebody tells me "Don't worry," I usually look down to see if my fly is open.
