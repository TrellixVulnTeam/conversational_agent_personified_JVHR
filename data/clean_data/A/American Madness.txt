TELLER: Come on, come on, Oscar, what are we waiting for?
2ND TELLER: What's the matter? Can't you find it?
3RD TELLER: Sneak up on it, boy!
4TH TELLER: Oscar, come on!
CHARLIE: Say, if it had lipstick on it, he'd find it!
OSCAR: Almonds to you![1] Almonds!
TELLERS: Now, now, Oscar - not almonds!
CHARLIE: Nine o'clock and all is lousy!
1ST TELLER: Yes, I spend half of my life waiting for these time clocks to open. Say, where's Matt?
CHARLIE: Probably upstairs thinking up that daily 2ND TELLER That guy kills me with his wisecracks.
2ND TELLER: That guy kills me with his wisecracks.
3RD TELLER: Say, when he comes in, let's put on a frozen face. Let's not smile.
1ST TELLER: Shhh! Nix! Here he comes
MATT: How are you doing slaves?
TELLERS: Hello, Matt. How're you Matt?
MATT: ( with his back to them )
1ST TELLER: No Matt, what is the story about the pawnbroker with the glass eye?
MATT: ( as he continues to fiddle with the lock )
MATT: Sympathy! You know, the right one had more sympathy than the other one!
1ST TELLER: What's the matter? Can't you get this thing open?
MATT: ( contemptuously )
TELLERS: ( ad-libbing )
MATT: Come on, white collars. The day's started!
MATT: You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
MATT: ( as he goes )
MATT: How are you fixed?
TELLER: I'm okay, Matt.
MATT: ( to another teller )
2ND TELLER: I'll be all right.
CHARLIE: Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
MATT: How much?
CHARLIE: About twenty-four thousand.
MATT: ( counting out money )
CHARLIE: Here's twenty-five thousand.
MATT: Here's twenty-five thousand.
MATT: Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
CHARLIE: Let me have ten bucks?
MATT: Let me have ten bucks?
CHARLIE: ( aghast )
MATT: ? 107 ? Charlie starts out. Matt follows him.
CHARLIE: Charlie starts out. Matt follows him.
MATT: ( as they walk )
CHARLIE: ( unsympathetically )
MATT: Now listen Charlie. I'll give you an I.O.U. I'll give you a note, I'll pay your mortgage, it's a matter of life and death
CHARLIE: Whose death?
MATT: It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
CHARLIE: Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
MATT: Aw, nerts!
CHARLIE: Come over and see us sometime.
MATT: I'm not asking you to pay off the Depression. I'm only asking you for ten bucks!
MATT: That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
TELLER: Yeah, what did he do with his first Bought himself a pocketbook!
MATT: Bought himself a pocketbook!
MATT: Hello, Helen!
HELEN: ( conspiratorially )
MATT: Come here, honey!
HELEN: Come here, honey!
MATT: Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
HELEN: ( already walking away )
SECRETARY: ( to Helen )
TELLER: Hey, psst!
OSCAR: Oh, oh. Five ill winds.
TELLER: ( standing next to Oscar )
HELEN: ( acidly )
GIRL: What are they doing here? There's no board meeting today.
HELEN: Search me.
CLARK: ( the most important of the important-looking men; to Helen )
HELEN: Not yet, Mr. Clark.
CLARK: When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
HELEN: Yes, sir.
CLARK: And tell him not to delay.
HELEN: Yes, sir.
GIRL: ( to Helen )
HELEN: Takes more than two tons of directors to make trouble for my boss.
GIRL: ( as she turns to go )
CLARK: I've sent for the cashier, gentlemen. He has a list of the loans that Dickson made last month.
CLARK: And as I told you at breakfast, it is time we did something about it.
SCHULTZ: Mr. Clark's right. Dickson will ruin this bank if we don't stop him.
AMES: ( another conservative stalwart )
IVES: ( feeble-voiced )
O'BRIEN: Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
CLARK: ( interrupting )
SCHULTZ: That's what I say. And the only way to end it is to get Dickson out.
O'BRIEN: Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
CLARK: Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
O'BRIEN: What good will that do?
CLARK: What good will that do? Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
IVES: It has just occurred to me
O'BRIEN: ( interrupting )
CLARK: He'll stand for it, if I have anything to say about it.
CLARK'S VOICE: Ah - come in, Cluett.
CLUETT: Here's the list.
CLARK: Yes, thank you.
CLUETT: Anything else?
CLARK: No. Nothing.
CLARK: Look at this. Just look at this. It's outrageous. Henry Moore - thirty-six thousand. Manny Goldberg - eighty-five hundred. Tony Consero - fifty-six thousand dollars. Joseph McDonald - eighteen thousand. Alvin Jones - sixty-six thousand dollars to a hotel that's on its last legs. I tell you, people get loans in this bank that couldn't borrow five cents anywhere else.
SCHULTZ: ( to the men at large )
AMES: Some day he'll get a "hunch" about a man and give the bank away.
CLARK: He's almost done that already. Our chief teller, Matt Brown, is an example of that. He breaks into Dickson's house, holds him up, and the next day gets a job in the bank.
IVES: Well, as far as I'm concerned
SCHULTZ: A boy who should be in jail, handling a bank's cash!
SHOT: Shooting toward Matt, inside the teller's cage, busily counting the money he is getting ready for Charlie.
HELEN: ( skeptically )
MATT: With what?
HELEN: The ten dollars.
MATT: ( quickly )
HELEN: ( catches himself in time )
MATT: ( catches himself in time )
HELEN: Oh, you think I'm lying?
MATT: Oh, you think I'm lying?
HELEN: All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
MATT: All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
HELEN: Oh, Matt.
MATT: Oh honey, why don't we get married? Then you can handle it all.
OSCAR: Say, Matt! Matt! Did you hear the news?
MATT: No, what?
OSCAR: Pardon me. All the big shots are in a huddle, and it looks like Dickson's out on his ear.
MATT: ( to Oscar )
OSCAR: No, I'm not kidding. Everybody's talking about it. Ask her.
HELEN: I haven't heard about it.
OSCAR: Sure, everybody's talking about it.
MATT: If that's on the level, there goes my assistant cashier's job.
OSCAR: Well, I just thought I'd drop by and cheer you up a bit.
OSCAR: I'll be seeing you, Matt - in the breadline.
IVES: That ham I had this morning was very 36. CLOSER SHOT ON THE GROUP Gentlemen, let's get organized before Dickson gets here. Schultz, can I count on you?
CLARK: Gentlemen, let's get organized before Dickson gets here. Schultz, can I count on you?
SCHULTZ: What about you, Ames?
CLARK: What about you, Ames?
AMES: That's the way I feel about it.
CLARK: Ives, how about you?
IVES: Well, the way I look at it, it seems ( interrupting )
CLARK: ( interrupting )
O'BRIEN: Well, you've got an awful fight on your hands. That's all I've got to say.
CLARK: Gentlemen, I think it's time that we do fight.
CLERK: ( passing by )
GARDINER: Good morning. You're on time this morning. It's about time.
GARDINER: Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
DICKSON: John, how's your wife this morning?
GARDINER: ( looking up, worship in his eyes )
DICKSON: Got a handkerchief?
GARDINER: Excuse me
DICKSON: Wait a minute.
GARDINER: I'm feeling fine this morning.
DICKSON: That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
GARDINER: Thank you!
DICKSON: ( sternly )
CARTER: Yes sir?
DICKSON: You know the rules about smoking . .
CARTER: Thank you, sir.
DICKSON: ( catching Matt's attention )
DICKSON: ( pleasantly )
BILL: Hello, Tom.
DICKSON: ( firmly, but pleasantly )
BILL: ( smiling )
DICKSON: Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
BILL: I want to know why .
DICKSON: ( to the man )
JANITOR: I haven't any.
DICKSON: You haven't got a uniform?
JANITOR: No, sir.
DICKSON: My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
JANITOR: Why, I don't know.
DICKSON: You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
BILL: Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest
DICKSON: ( interrupting )
BILL: But listen, Tom, I
CLOSE SHOT: As Dickson comes up to Helen at her desk. A lady sits nearby. Dickson notices Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
DICKSON: Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
MRS. PEMBROKE: Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
DICKSON: Got my letter?
MRS. PEMBROKE: Yes, thank you.
DICKSON: Hello, Helen.
HELEN: Good morning.
DICKSON: Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about I don't know.
HELEN: I don't know.
DICKSON: Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
HELEN: ( awkwardly )
DICKSON: Ummm. Stalling, eh?
HELEN: Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
DICKSON: Directors, eh? Long faces?
HELEN: ( she trumps his gesture )
DICKSON: ( half-under his breath )
MRS. PEMBROKE: Mr. Dickson?
DICKSON: Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
HELEN: ( into phone )
DICKSON: ( to Mrs. Pembroke )
DICKSON: Where are you? . . . Sure, well, come on down right away. Huh? . . . Yes, of course I remember. It's tonight.
MRS. PEMBROKE: But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
DICKSON: ( ill-at-ease )
DICKSON: Better hurry now. Goodbye. Good luck to you!
MRS. PEMBROKE: ( muttering )
DICKSON: ( to Helen )
BILL: What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
DICKSON: She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
BILL: ( puzzled )
DICKSON: If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
BILL: ( dumbly )
DICKSON: ( mimicking him )
DICKSON: Oh, make that uniform blue.
JANITOR: Yes, sir.
DICKSON: ( blithely; as he counts the board members present )
DICKSON: Well, it's a nice morning, gentlemen. How about two foursomes of golf?
IVES: ( eagerly )
DICKSON: ( undeterred; still practicing his golf swing )
CLARK: ( huffy )
DICKSON: Oh, you would, eh? All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
TELLER: ( at window )
CLERK: The check is no good. The man has no account here.
SADIE: Holy mackerel! I've been robbed.
CLERK: I'm sorry, madam.
SADIE: So am I. And don't call me madam!
GUARD: Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money Is it safe?
LADY: Is it safe?
GUARD: It's his life insurance money, you know.
LADY: It's his life insurance money, you know.
BANK GUARD: That's all right. You come with me, and I'll show you where to deposit your CAMERA GOES PAST and now singles out three men who are coming forward. One glance and we know they are here for no kosher reason.
LEADER: There he is! Good morning!
CLUETT: ( shaking )
LEADER: ( flatly )
1ST GANGSTER: ( drawling )
CLUETT: ( uncertainly - sickly smile )
HELEN: Hey Pat, come here! Look!
SECRETARY: ( to Helen )
HELEN: I wonder what he's doing with Mr. Cluett.
SECRETARY: ( still staring - thrilled - shuddering )
SHOT: Shooting down the length of the table. The men are all sitting around the large table. Dickson is on his feet.
DICKSON: ( firmly )
DICKSON: ( the injustice kills him )
SCHULTZ: You can make a handsome profit on your ? 124 ? I'm not interested in profits. I'm interested in the bank. In the depositors. They're my friends. They're looking to me for protection, and I'm not walking out on them.
DICKSON: I'm not interested in profits. I'm interested in the bank. In the depositors. They're my friends. They're looking to me for protection, and I'm not walking out on them.
CLARK: How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
O'BRIEN: ( admonishing him )
IVES: ( still trying )
DICKSON: ( unruffled, paying no attention to Ives )
CLARK: All right. I'll speak my piece. Dickson, you've got to change your policy.
DICKSON: What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?
CLARK: ( mumbles disdainfully )
AMES: Conditions have changed. These are precarious times. Banks today have got to be careful. And you've been more liberal than ever.
DICKSON'S VOICE: Yes, and I'm going to continue to be liberal . . .
DICKSON: The trouble with this country today is there's too much hoarded cash. Idle money is no good to industry. Where is all the money today? In the banks, vaults, socks, old tin cans, buried in the ground! I tell you, we've got to get the money in circulation before you'll get this country back to prosperity.
CLARK: Who are we going to give it to? Men like Jones? Last week you made him an extra loan of fifty thousand dollars. Do you call that intelligent banking?
SCHULTZ: He can't pay his bills. How do you expect him to pay us?
DICKSON: That's a fair question, Schultz. Now let's see how bad a risk Jones is. What's his history? He's been a successful business man for thirty-five years. Two years ago business started falling off. Today Jones needs money, and if he doesn't get it, he goes into bankruptcy and throws nine hundred men out of work. Answer - unemployment.
DICKSON'S VOICE: It also means his creditors aren't paid. They're in trouble. They go to banks and are turned down . . . more bankruptcies
DICKSON: It's a vicious circle, my friends, and the only place to cure it is right here at the source. Help Jones and you help the whole circle. Now, when Jones comes to me, I ask myself two questions. First - is he honest? Yes. Second - is he as good a business man as he was before? And the answer is - he's better .
DICKSON'S VOICE: He is not only older and wiser, but his present trouble has taught him precaution. In my estimation, gentlemen, Jones is no risk. Neither are the thousands of other Joneses throughout the country
DICKSON: It's they who built this nation up to the richest in the world, and it's up to the banks to give them a break. Disraeli said security is the prosperity of the ( cutting him off )
AMES: ( cutting him off )
DICKSON: Well, he should have said it. It's as true now as it was then. And let us get the right kind of security. Not stocks and bonds that zig-zag up and down, not collateral on paper, but character!
CLARK: ( indignantly )
DICKSON: Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character! It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
CLOSE SHOT: Cluett sits at his desk, his face drawn, panic-stricken. He is like an animal at bay. The leader of the trio, Dude Finlay, sits in a chair directly in front of Cluett. The other two men stand on either side of the desk.
DUDE: ( menacingly )
CLUETT: ( trembling )
DUDE: That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
CLUETT: ( helplessly )
DUDE: ( barking )
CLUETT: I'm sorry, Dude, butI
DUDE: That don't do us any good.
CLUETT: But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
DUDE: ( threateningly - quietly )
CLUETT: ( wants time to think )
DUDE: ( shrewdly - to the men )
DUDE: There's plenty of it in this bank - laying around loose.
CLUETT: ( pop-eyed, choked voice )
DUDE: Why not?
CLUETT: ( perspiring freely )
DUDE: ( flatly )
CLUETT: ( slowly )
DUDE: All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
CLUETT: No, no, I couldn't - I couldn't do anything like that. I
MED. SHOT: Helen sits at her typewriter. A very dignified, beautiful woman of thirty approaches her. She is Phyllis Dickson, Dickson's wife. She radiates refinement and culture.
MRS. DICKSON: ( pleasantly )
HELEN: How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
MRS. DICKSON: Is that busy husband of mine busy?
HELEN: ( indicating conference room )
MRS. DICKSON: ( not unexpected )
HELEN: I'm afraid so.
MRS. DICKSON: Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
HELEN: MRS. DICKSON Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless! If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
MRS. DICKSON: Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless! If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
HELEN: 82. CLOSE SHOT - MRS. DICKSON Shooting past Helen.
MRS. DICKSON: Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
HELEN: All right.
CLUETT: ( nervously )
DUDE: You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
CLUETT: I know, but
DUDE: Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
CLUETT: But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
DUDE: ( positively )
MRS. DICKSON: ( playful reproach )
CLUETT: ( smiling feebly )
MRS. DICKSON: ( shaking her head )
CLUETT: Why, I needed a
MRS. DICKSON: ( screwing up her face )
CLUETT: No, no, of course not. Not at all. Oh, As she takes out a cigarette, he offers her a light. Mrs. Dickson notices that he is rather nervous.
MRS. DICKSON: What is the matter with you? You're 86. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT ( trying to be light )
CLUETT: ( trying to be light )
MRS. DICKSON: Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
CLUETT: Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
MRS. DICKSON: For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you
CLUETT: Well, you can. You always could.
MRS. DICKSON: ( smiling )
MRS. DICKSON: ( good-natured admonishment )
CLUETT: ( not understanding )
MRS. DICKSON: ( finishing her little joke )
CLUETT: If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
MRS. DICKSON: Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
CLUETT: MRS. DICKSON Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
MRS. DICKSON: Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
MRS. DICKSON: ( continuing )
CLUETT: ( trying hard )
MRS. DICKSON: ( laughs )
CLUETT: He suddenly gets an idea. He was told to be with someone around midnight. Someone who would be an alibi for him. He stares off at Phyllis Dickson. Why MRS. DICKSON ( continuing )
MRS. DICKSON: ( continuing )
CLUETT: Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
MRS. DICKSON: See, we're getting along famously!
DICKSON: Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
CLARK: I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
DICKSON: I know what you mean by that. You want me to hang on to our cash. Well, I don't believe in it. The law demands that I carry a certain legal reserve, and I'm doing it. The rest of our money is out working . . . working to help industry . . . to help build up business
CLARK: In the meantime, you're jeopardizing the safety of the bank. Well, we won't stand for it!
DICKSON: You have to stand for it.
IVES: ( exhausted )
SCHULTZ: ( interrupting )
DICKSON: Go ahead - take all the action you want!
DICKSON: I'm running this bank my way. Get that Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
CLARK: Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
DICKSON: Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
DICKSON'S VOICE: Before I take a man into this bank, and before I extend credit to anyone, I satisfy myself on one thing - do I believe in him?
DICKSON: So far, my judgement has been right one hundred per cent. One hundred per cent! When I start going wrong, you won't have to take any action. I'll turn the bank over to you. Then you ? 134 ? merge all you want to. I won't be the fellow to run it then. Good day, gentlemen!
DICKSON: ( cheerfully )
HELEN: Yes, sir.
CLUETT: ( mid-stream )
MRS. DICKSON: ( not at all angry )
CLUETT: ( simply )
MRS. DICKSON: Tonight, Oh, never! Tonight I have reserved for a very special occasion. Believe it or not, it's our wedding anniversary. Tom doesn't probably even remember it. But then, they never do, do they?
CLUETT'S VOICE: No, they don't
MRS. DICKSON: But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
CLUETT: ( after a pause )
MRS. DICKSON: ( smiling )
CLUETT: ( he won't give up )
MRS. DICKSON: ( surprised )
CLUETT: Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
MRS. DICKSON: Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to ( desperate-sounding )
CLUETT: ( desperate-sounding )
MRS. DICKSON: ( flattered, but a little suspicious )
CLUETT: ( intense sincerity )
MRS. DICKSON: I want to be near you!
CLUETT: I want to be near you!
MRS. DICKSON: Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
CLUETT: Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
MRS. DICKSON: ( still flattered, lightly )
CLUETT: I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
MRS. DICKSON: ( still only half-believing )
CLUETT: No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
MRS. DICKSON: ? 136 ? Before she realizes what has happened, he has swept her into his arms and crushes her to him. CAMERA PANS AWAY from them to the door to the outer office. The door opens and Matt steps in. He stops, suddenly, transfixed by what he sees off scene.
CLUETT: Please forgive me, Phyllis. I lost my head for a minute. But I couldn't help it, Phyllis.
MRS. DICKSON: Please stop apologizing so much. You're making it far too important.
HELEN: ( happily )
HELEN: Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
MATT: ( tonelessly )
MED. SHOT: Dickson sits at his desk when Matt enters. When he sees Matt, his face breaks into a broad, pleasant smile.
DICKSON: ( grandly )
MATT: It's all right. Thanks.
DICKSON: And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . .
DICKSON: What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
MATT: ( feebly )
DICKSON: ( scrutinizing him closely, very much hurt )
MATT: Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.
DICKSON: Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
MATT: Well, I
DICKSON: I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
DICKSON: Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
MRS. DICKSON: Hello, darling.
DICKSON: If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
MRS. DICKSON: ( with a half-smile )
DICKSON: Oooh! That has the earmarks!
DICKSON: ( good-naturedly )
HELEN: ( excitedly )
MATT: ( dolefully )
HELEN: What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
MATT: Come here.
HELEN: Well . . . ?
MATT: Well, he was making love to her.
HELEN: ( after a pause )
MATT: I tell you, I saw them!
HELEN: In Cluett's office?
MATT: Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
HELEN: ( as she goes to answer the phone )
DICKSON: ( talking on the phone, as Mrs Dickson waits patiently )
HELEN'S VOICE: Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
DICKSON: Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
HELEN'S VOICE: Yes, sir.
DICKSON: What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
MRS. DICKSON: Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
DICKSON: Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
MRS. DICKSON: I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
DICKSON: I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
MRS. DICKSON: Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
DICKSON: But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
MRS. DICKSON: ( interrupting )
DICKSON: Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
MRS. DICKSON: The theatre?
DICKSON: That's what it was you planned, wasn't MRS. DICKSON ( after a slight hesitation )
MRS. DICKSON: ( after a slight hesitation )
DICKSON: You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
MRS. DICKSON: The girls! I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
DICKSON: Ho! Ho! Ho!
MRS. DICKSON: Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
DICKSON: Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
MRS. DICKSON: Well . . .
DICKSON: Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
MRS. DICKSON: Tomorrow night?
DICKSON: ? 142 ? Mr. Gardner's here.
VOICE: Mr. Gardner's here.
DICKSON: ( answering the intercom )
MRS. DICKSON: ( still skeptical )
DICKSON: ( assuringly )
MRS. DICKSON: ( mock-pouting )
DICKSON: ( tenderly )

SAMPSON: I'm afraid he's been stalling.
DICKSON: That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
SAMPSON: He says he can't get away in the daytime.

DETECTIVE: Well, you'd better call the coroner.
OSCAR: ( breathlessly )
OSCAR: Do you see that clock? Right there. That's where the bullet hit. When I saw that, you coulda knocked me over with a pin.
CLERK: Was there much blood?
OSCAR: ( gesturing toward body )
DETECTIVE: ( officiously )
CHARLIE: ( running up )

INSPECTOR: Then you did it and you did it alone
DICKSON: ( to Matt )
INSPECTOR: I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
DICKSON: Why pick on him ?
INSPECTOR: It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?

SAMPSON: Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
DICKSON: The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.

DICKSON: Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
CLARK: No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've

CLUETT: They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
DICKSON: ( desperately )
CLUETT: I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .
INSPECTOR: ( practical )
CLUETT: ( wild-eyed )
INSPECTOR: ( skeptically )
CLUETT: ( desperately - to Dickson )
DICKSON: ( dully )
INSPECTOR: ( out of the side of his mouth - to a detective standing next to him )
DICKSON: What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
CLUETT: ( hysterically )
DICKSON: You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
CLUETT: She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
DICKSON: ( a shriek )
INSPECTOR: Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
DICKSON: ( hard )
DICKSON: HELEN'S VOICE ? 187 ? Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.

DICKSON: MRS. DICKSON ( into phone )
MRS. DICKSON: ( into phone )
SHOT: Favoring Dickson, but showing Cluett and the others.
CLUETT: ( miserably )
DICKSON: ( an explosion )
INSPECTOR: All right. Let's go.
O'BRIEN: Clark, you're insane to hold out any longer. Now let's get some money over here and stop this run.
AMES: If we close our doors, our stock won't be worth a nickel.
IVES: My dear friends, I
O'BRIEN: ( interrupting )
SCHULTZ: Maybe they're right, Clark.
CLARK: ( weakening )
FULL SHOT: Dickson sits at his desk, his head cupped in his hands. Clark enters thru door of outer office, quietly. He looks at Dickson a moment, then crosses to the Oh, Dickson . . .
CLARK: Oh, Dickson . . .
CLARK: ( softly )
DICKSON: ( heartsick )
CLARK: ( smoothly )
DICKSON: Eighty dollars? That's fine - anything you say.
CLARK: Good, good. I'll draw it up at once.
HELEN: You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
DICKSON: ( toneless )
MATT: What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
HELEN: Something's happened. He isn't trying They must have turned him down.
MATT: They must have turned him down.
HELEN: Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
MATT: Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
MATT: We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
DICKSON: ( softly )
MATT: ( ignoring the question )
DICKSON: Were you in Cluett's apartment?
MATT: ( dismissively )
DICKSON: ( gravely )
MATT: Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is
DICKSON: ( undeterred )
MATT: ( fumbling for words )
MATT: Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
DICKSON: ( firmly )
AND HELEN: Immediately following:
HELEN: Did you talk to him?
MATT: ( downcast )
MED. CLOSEUP: All of his beliefs are shaken by this seeming betrayal. Dickson takes a framed photograph of Phyllis from his desk, gingerly sets it face down in the center drawer of his desk.
CLARK: a thirty-day option on ten thousand shares of stock of this company, now registered in the name of Thomas A. Dickson. Now make that in triplicate and get it to me just as fast as you can. Hurry!

MRS. DICKSON: ( shouting )
GUARD: ( reaching into Helen's desk )
FULL SHOT: As Mrs. Dickson rushes in.
MRS. DICKSON: ( softly - seriously )
MRS. DICKSON: Cyril Cluett doesn't mean anything to me, Tom. I went out with him last night simply because . . . well, I had begun to feel that I didn't have any part in your life. That I was an outsider. Tom, all we did was to go to the theatre, and then we went back to his apartment afterward for a drink. That's all it was. I didn't do anything wrong, Tom. I couldn't do anything wrong. I love you too much. You know that.
MRS. DICKSON: ( breaking down - sobbing )
MATT: ( into phone - rat-a-tat )
HELEN: ( simultaneously )
MATT: ( continuing )
HELEN: ( looking up from her own phone pitch )
JONES: Any bank that Tom Dickson has anything to do with is all right. I'm putting my money in here. Why should you be afraid? Give him a chance. Tom Dickson is all right! He's perfectly square. I'm putting my money in this bank! I know what I'm doing!

MATT: ( to Helen )
MAN: ( loudly )
2ND MAN: I want to make a deposit. Four thousand, six hundred dollars. He's the best man in the world. I believe in him.
MRS. DICKSON: It doesn't matter what you think about me, there's something far more important. Those people down there. The bank, Tom. You can't give that up.
SAMPSON: Mr. Dickson! Come here a minute. Look at this. Something wonderful has happened. People are bringing deposits. You won't believe it until you see it. You have to come out.
SAMPSON: ( pointing off )
SHOT: From Dickson's angle.
MAN: ( shouting )
ANOTHER MAN: ( shouting )
3RD MAN: I haven't got much, but here it is!
WOMAN: Tom Dickson can have all my money any ? 196 ? CUT TO: 275. INT. OUTSIDE OF DICKSON'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP On Dickson, looking toward Receiving Teller's window. He stares at the miraculous spectacle, deeply moved. He can scarcely believe his own eyes. A smile grows on his face.
DICKSON: Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
CLARK: We've been waiting fifteen minutes
DICKSON: ( waving papers away )
DICKSON'S VOICE: Come on boys! Come on Clark! It'll do your heart good.
DICKSON: Look at that. They're shoving their hard-earned money across the counter with a ten to one chance against them.
DICKSON: If you fellas want to save this bank, get some real money over here right ( decisively )
O'BRIEN: ( decisively )
DICKSON: Now you're talking! Ames?
AMES: I'm sold.
DICKSON: All right. Schultz?
SCHULTZ: ( only a moment's hesitation )
DICKSON: 279. CLOSE SHOT - IVES At last he can say something.
IVES: ( shaky voice )
DICKSON: Go ahead and say it.
CLARK: Oh, I don't agree with you, but if everybody's gone crazy, I'll go crazy too!
CLOSEUPS: As Clark and the other directors make their urgent phone calls.
SCHULTZ: ( into phone )
CLARK: ( into phone )
AMES: ( into phone )
CLARK: ( into phone )

MAN: ( to nearby man )
GERT: Good morning. Union National Bank. Just a minute . . .
CHARLIE: Nine o'clock and all is lousy.
TELLER: Where's Matt?
CHARLIE: Ten to one he'll have a crack about the run yesterday.
TELLER: It's a cinch bet. I wouldn't take it.
2ND TELLER: If he pulls a gag about the run, we'll murder the guy. Murder him!
MATT: ( after having opened the lock - turning to the group of expectant tellers )
SHOT: As Dickson enters, and playfully pushes the hat down over Gardiner, the old bank guard's face. The bank guard adjusts his hat, annoyed, then sees it is the president of the bank.
GARDINER: ( merrily )
DICKSON: Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right Guard puzzles over his non-sequitur for a moment, then smiles.
DICKSON: The teller, from Dickson's angle, holds up his empty hands. No cigarettes. Then, he opens his mouth and chews elaborately, showing that he has switched to gum.
DICKSON: Well, well, well - got your uniform, Yes, sir.
JANITOR: Yes, sir.
DICKSON: Looks good. How much did it cost?
JANITOR: ( proudly )
DICKSON: ( cheerfully )
DICKSON: Good morning, Helen.
HELEN: Good morning.
DICKSON: Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt, hearing his name, dashes up to stand next to Dickson.
DICKSON: I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
MATT: ( weakly )
DICKSON: I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
DICKSON: Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria[9] sailing next week.
MATT: Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
HELEN: ( cutting him off )
DICKSON: ( cutting him off )
MATT: Come, on slave.
