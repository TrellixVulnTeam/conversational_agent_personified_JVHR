DEREK: Danny smiles at his brother and nods. Danny puts his ear phones on and heads to class. Derek watches his brother through the chain-link fence. Danny meets up with Lizzy and they soon disappear from Derek's sight. Derek turns and walks down the street.
COP #1: Derek stops in his tracks, walks back over to the fence, and stares at the school.

DANNY: LITTLE HENRY ( afraid )
LITTLE HENRY: ( afraid ) What does it look like I'm doin'?
DANNY: do this. Come on. Henry? THE DOOR SMACKS OPEN and Danny moves to grab the pistol. It discharges and a bullet rockets into Danny's chest. He SLAMS back into the URINAL and gasps for air. The force of the pistol knocks Henry to the ground. The two kids who just entered bolt for help. Danny slides to the tile, leaving a bloody trail. The two stare at each other - EYE TO EYE. THE BLOODSTAINED PAPER falls into the DAMP SINK. Danny inhales like glass is raking his lungs.
LITTLE HENRY: ( terrified ) Danny's breathing slows to a choked whisper. He blinks, coughs, twitches. And dies.
LITTLE HENRY: Vinyard? Danny? Henry watches teary-eyed with the same altered look Derek had after killing Lawrence. Together they FREEZE on the cold tile floor.
RASMUSSEN: INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON DEREK AND DANNY Derek cradles his bloody brother. Sweeney walks over, crouches, and talks to Derek's back.
SWEENEY: They gotta get him outta here.
DEREK: I can't. Derek begins to cry outright. He can't control himself. He lets go of Danny's corpse and charges out into the INT. HALLWAY - DORIS AND DAVINA Derek embraces them. Doris grabs his face torn between love and hate. Guilt-ridden, Derek tears from them and storms down the hall with Sweeney soon in tow.
SWEENEY: right now and I want you to forget about it!
DEREK: thinkin', Sweeney!?
SWEENEY: Drowning in rage, Derek turns back to a misty eyed back. Don't do it, Derek. Please, man. You've come too far. The war is Derek contemplates the situation and presses his tongue against his teeth, crackbrained. Sweeney slowly approaches and cautiously wraps his arms around the young man. Derek buries his tearing face in Sweeney's Sweeney nods and the two lock eyes. Derek makes his way back to Doris and Davina and together, they grieve.
