BUCKAROO BANZAI: CARD OVER.WHITE LETTERS ON A DARK BACKGROUND:
NARRATOR: of the Cold War as the decade of the 1950s looms. Stung by this Soviet challenge and the rapid race to develop ever more sophisticated weapons, the United States resurrects maverick Professor Toichi Hikita's work in electromagnetic particle acceleration.despite the dismal record of failure that has dogged the project. TOICHI HIKITA, one of the group, walks forward, taking the CAMERA from its present operator, a four-year-old child.A LITTLE BOY IN CHAPS AND COWBOY HAT who now joins the other adults, in particular Caucasian woman and the elder Oriental man who pick him up and hug him.
NARRATOR: himself anxious to work for the Allies. Enamored of the great American West, Banzai sires a precocious son and tags the tiny child "Buckaroo." A tribute to his adopted homeland.
NARRATOR: disaster at Princeton, Doctor Hikita finds new life at the Texas School of Mines, where he assembles a team of crack scientists willing to gamble he's right in his bold assertion that man can indeed pass unharmed through solid matter. The SECOND "PILOT," a fair-haired Caucasian: 3
NARRATOR: with Whitehead and Lord Russell of the world's most advanced theoretical gravity catapult.
NARRATOR: .wife of Dr. Masado Banzai. .as the four-year-old BUCKAROO BANZAI now approaches the speed machine and gives his father a good-bye kiss.Dr. Banzai saying something to the boy, Buckaroo bowing respectfully, as his father and mother exchange last-minute assurances. The cockpit canopy comes down, and Sandra Banzai tugs a reluctant little Buckaroo toward a sandbagged shelter.
