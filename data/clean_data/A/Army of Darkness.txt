ASH: Why would you say that I am insane? I wouldn't say that I've lost my mind simply because I've heard the voices and seen the godless things moving in the woods. If anything, I think more clearly now than ever before. I know now that there is such a thing as a living Evil. A dark and shapeless thing that lives not in the spaces we know, but between them. In the Dark. In the night. And it wants the exact same thing as you and I: a chance at warm life on this Earth. It doesn't care that is already had that chance .once. Now listen closely because there isn't much time. Listen and believe, because it's all true.
"BRUCE CAMPBELL": The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as.
WARRIOR #1: Hail to him who has come from the sky to deliver us from the terror of the Deadites! Hail!
ASH: Take is easy now chief. I don't know how I got here and I'm not lookin' for any trouble.
WISEMAN JOHN: My Lord Arthur, I believe he is the promised one, written of in the Necronomicon.
ARTHUR: He bleeds. As a man bleeds. The one written of in the Book would not bleed.
ARTHUR: Likely, he is one of Henry's men. I say to the pit with him! If he is truly the promised one. he will emerge.
ASH: Where the hell they put the stirrups on this thing!!??
ARTHUR: LIEUTENANTS! Fetch me the blackard.
ASH: 46 THE FIRST HORSEMAN 46
GIDDYPU!: 46 THE FIRST HORSEMAN 46
WHOOSH!!!: 47 ASH 47
THUNK!: 49 ASH 49
WHOOSH!: ASH looks left.
ARTHUR: Bring the prisoner! The warriors surge upon Ash. His sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw are taken from him.
ASH: 72 GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS 72
ARTHUR: To the castle!
GOLD TOOTH: Move along now!
SHEILA: a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. She searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned. She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur atop his horse.
SHEILA: M'Lord Arthur! Where is my brother? Did he not ride with you?
ARTHUR: Eye. And fought valiantly. But last night fell in battle to Duke Henry's men.
SHEILA: Her face does not immediately register the grief. She attempts to step forward but stumbles. She steadies herself against the stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash. She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks at him as he's dragged along.
SHEILA: Foul thing! A pox on your throat! Thou art a Murderer! A black 80 VILLAGE WOMEN 80 restrain her.
SHEILA: cries as the Village Women attempt to soothe her.
DUKE HENRY: You sir, are not one of my vassals. Who are you?
ASH: Who wants to know?
DUKE HENRY: I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale. Lord of the Northlands and leader of its people.
ASH: You ain't leadin' but two things now, pal. Jack and shit. And Jack left town.
ARTHUR: There is an Evil that has awakened in this land. And whilst my people fight for their very souls against it, you, Duke Henry the Red, wage war on us. Your people are no better than the foul corruption that lies in the bowels of that pit! May God have mercy on your souls.
OLD WOMAN: Aye. Into the pit with the bloodthirsty sons of whores! She jams a meat pie into her mouth and cheers excitedly as
ASH: Hey, I never even saw these assholes before.. He spins to Duke Henry the Red. You gotta tell 'em you don't know me. We never met. Tell him.
HENRY: I do not believe that he shall 101 THE WARRIORS 101 grab Ash and shove him into the pit.
ASH: Come on, you blasted piece of He thrusts out his chainsaw arm, yanking the starter cord and.

ASH: All right now. Who wants to be next? Who wants some.
ASH: You want some more? Huh?! Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth. Ash calls out to Henry.
ASH: Now climb on those horses and get out of here.
ARTHUR: Nay. Henry is my prisoners. He
ASH: GIDDYUP NOW!! HYAAAH! 153 THE STUNNED CROWD 153 parts allowing.
ARTHUR: For that, I shall see you dead.
ASH: This is my boomstick. It's a twelve gauge, double barreled Remington pump. Next one of you primitives touch me.
ASH: Bring me your hoo do man.
SHEILA: I pray thee to forgive me. I believed thee one of Henry's men. She touches Ash's hand. Ash turns away
ASH: First you wanta kill me, now ya wanna kiss me. He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.
ASH: Lady, just leave me alone.
SHEILA: I'm sorry m'lord. Please understand. T'is a cruel time for us. The Wisemen say you are the promised one. Our only hope against the darkness that has descended on this land.
ASH: They're mistaken. She stares deeply into his eyes.
SHEILA: I think not. I feel that there is reason for your being here. It is no accident.
ASH: Well what is it? Can you send me back or not?
WISEMAN JOHN: Only the Necronomicon has the power. A power which we both require. It contains passages that can dispel the Evil from this place and return you to your time.
ASH: The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's the thing that got me here.
WISEMAN JOHN: It is in a place far from here. It can only be retrieved by the Promised one. Other Warriors have tried. Their widows grieve still. We have waited long years for you. Out only hope is the Necronomicon. Thou must undertake to quest for it. Alone must thou travel to a distant cemetery. There thou shalt find it.
ASH: Me? Now way, no day. Only place I'm goin' is home. A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.
POSSESSED WOMAN: YOU SHALL DIE! Her eyes are bone white. She is POSSESSED by the dark spirit. Her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by invisible hands. Her blackened lips pull back in a wild animal snarl. With two voice at once;
POSSESSED WOMAN: YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE NECRONOMICON. WE SHALL FEAST UPON YOUR SOUL, AND THEN THE SOUL OF 174 THE POSSESSED WOMAN 174 collapses. Her face turned away from the Wisemen as it lays in the dust.
MAN!: 174 THE POSSESSED WOMAN 174
ASH: It's a trick. Get an axe.
BOOM!: Which topples the next, which sets off a chain reaction.
POSSESSED WOMAN: The Evil lives. Slay me and ten will rise to take my place. All will die. ALL WILL -
CHOP!: 198 IN SILHOUETTE, THE AXE 198
WISEMAN JOHN: Now. Will thou quest for the 201 CLOSE ON ASH 201 He considers.
THE BLACKSMITH: attaches the shock absorber spring to the iron hand.
WHOOSH CLANG!: ASH'S SPRING DRIVEN HAND clenches closed with such great power, that it bends a iron 212 CLOSE ON ASH 212 He studies his new hand. It will do nicely.
ASH: stares over the castle wall to the foreboding wasteland with apprehension. The wind blows upon his hair. Sheila appears behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent cape. Ash draws her body close to his. He wraps the cape around her. Together they stare off into the night, then turn to one another and kiss.
ASH: He wears an iron breastplate with the insignia of Arthur's army that compliments his new spring-powered iron hand. His chainsaw juts from it's saddle holster on the horse's back. Ash's cape billows as he rides.
ASH: What's going on?
ARTHUR: points to.
WISEMAN JOHN: This is the edge of the land ruled by the Dark Spirit. This path will lead you to an unholy place. A cemetery. There, the Necronomicon 218 ASH 218 anxiously eyes the wall of swirling mist.
ASH'S HORSE: which nervously pounds the earth with it's hooves.
WARRIOR #1: Lord Arthur, he is supplied. Now I beg of you, let us leave this foul place.
ARTHUR: A moment.
WISEMAN JOHN: As thou removest the Book from it's cradle, you must recite these words. Clatoo, verata, Nicto.
ASH: Clatto Verata Nicto. Okay.
WISEMAN JOHN: Repeat them.
ASH: Clatto Verata Nicto.
WISEMAN #1: I got it. I got it. I know your damn words. All right? Now you get this straight: I get the book, you send me back. That's the deal. After that I'm history. Ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist
ASH: I got it. I got it. I know your damn words. All right? Now you get this straight: I get the book, you send me back. That's the deal. After that I'm history. Ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist

ASH: rides out of the wall of mist. He finds himself on a trail leading into a thick forest.
ASH: Come on! Come on! The chainsaw dies. He jerks out his arm to restart it. Putt. Blasted piece of junk!
ASH: Blasted piece of junk!
BANG!: 252 INT. SHED 252
BANG!: Earth shaking in its intensity. The planks of the door shudder behind Ash.
ASH: enters the Mill.
ASH: Anybody here?! The place is quiet. Ash slumps down against a wall to catch his This place'll do for the night. Get the book in the morning.
ASH: This place'll do for the night. Get the book in the morning.
ASH: listens as the cabin CREAKS like an old ship beneath the force of the gale.
ASH: Damn this cold.
ASH: 'least I won't freeze to death. He turns to a tiny sound.
ASH: Easy, boy. The horse calms. Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill.
ASH: stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the Mill, halting Ash's view. Ash races for the Mill.
ASH: races through the door and toward CAMERA when.SMASH.Ash's reflection shatters. He's run into a mirror. Shivering, he picks himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO..

RIP!!: 310 THE NAIL RIPS 310
ASH: Nasty little thing's inside me. He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain. Well let's see how you like a little hot water! He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding contents painfully down his throat. He sets down the kettle and waits for a moment. A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach
ASH: emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest. Then his arm. He rips back his shirt sleeve.
ASH: Why you dirty little.AHHHHHH!!
ASH: Soon as I get out of this thing
I. YIEEEE!!: THE PAIR OF IRON PLIERS dip into Ash's mouth and clamps down upon a back molar.

ASH: Where the hell are ya!?
ASH: I can't see ya!!
ASH: No, nonot the poke 332 ASH 332 jerks his head free from the vice with a SCREAM. He holds up his iron hand. It's back to normal. Again under his control.
ASH: Okay then. But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His shoulder itches. He scratches it. The Itch grows. It itches madly. He rips back his shirt. Upon his shoulder. THERE
ASH: staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through the brambles. He races up to the CAMERA and cries out as this protrusion upon his shoulder becomes more pronounced.
ASH: Dear God, it's growing bigger!
GOOD ASH: What. are you? Are you me?
BAD ASH: WHAT. ARE GOO? ARE GOO ME?!! You sound like a jerk!
GOOD ASH: Why are you doing this?!
BAD ASH: Wanna know? 'cause the answers easy. It's cause I'm the bad Ash, and yer.

ASH: I know better than to bury you 353 EXT. MILL WHEEL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT 353 The giant blades of the Mill are illuminated with bright flashes of lightning. The wind kicks up leaves as Ash throws the body of his Evil Twin onto a workbench at the base of the windmill. The giant blades of the mill arc down into frame with a WHOOSH-
ASH: with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag from the Mill. Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of an old Oak Tree in the graveyard. Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet as he digs a grave.
ASH: Now you see what's what. Man's body is his own personal property. Don't anybody try to take that away from him.
ASH: Hey, what's that you got on your 363 CLOSE SHOT - THE EVIL DEAD 363 It's eyes dart, looking for something on it's face when a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop it.

ASH: Wait. Three books? Nobody said anything about that. Ha! That Wiseman was so busy fillin' me fulla his secret words and phrases and, and, his. bullshit, he forgot to mention anything about that. Like do I take all of 'em of one or 'em, or what? Well. He reaches for the first book and opens it.
WHOOOOOOSH!!!: To reveal a black hole. SCREAMS ERUPT from the dark abyss of the Book. It begins to suck things into it.
ASH: Woah. Wrong book. He turns to study.
ASH: tries to decide between them. At first he's sure which one it is. Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses the other.
ASH: Ash reaches for it again and the book bites him!
ASH: Dear God, help me. ahhh!!! The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!
ASH: Okay. The words. Say the words. KLATOO!. VERATA. uh. Uh. Necta. uh. Nectar. Necktie. uh. He hesitates, then calls out boldly.
ASH: KLATOO. VERATA. He deliberately muffles the last word that he can't remember. The wind stops. It seems to have worked. He looks about with growing confidence.
ASH: Okay then. But he loses his smile as. a LOW RUMBLE is heard on the 397 LONG SHOT - CEMETARY 397 A tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by one are thrust from the earth.
ASH: A tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by one are thrust from the earth.
ASH: Hey, wait a minute. Everything's cool! I said the words! I did!
A DOOR: blows open revealing Wiseman John. He looks at the gathering storm with foreboding.
WISEMAN JOHN: Something is amiss.
ASH: No.. no more. The skeletal fists pepper Ash's face with punches.
ASH: Leave me alone! Leave me aHUUU!
ASH: jerks backward, vomiting out the skeletal arm. He tumbles to the ground.
ASH: ( in a snarl ) Keep you damn filthy bones outta my mouth. SNAP! He breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea of limbs. A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the Book of the Dead but Ash scoops it up first. He leaps over another set of groping arms that rip from the ground!
ASH: stares in horror at his evil self. All around, skeletons rip from the earth and shriek as they come back to life!
ASH: I'm through bein' their garbage boy. I did my part of the He pats the saddlebag, where the book is and grins. Now they owe me. Like in the deal. I want back. He whips his horse.
ASH: A tiny figure, rides toward the castle.
GOLD TOOTH: Open the gates. The Promised one has returned!
THE DRAWBRIDGE: swings down.
TWO WARRIORS: hold Ash's horse as he dismounts. There are excited shouts from the villagers
VILLAGERS: The stranger has returned! He's brought the book!
ASH: is led to the THREE WISEMEN.
WISEMAN JOHN: The Necronomicon. Quickly.
WISEMAN JOHN: Did you bring the Necronomicon!
ASH: Yes. It's just that.
WISEMAN JOHN: Just what?!
ASH: Nothing. Here Ash produces the Necronomicon. Now send be back. Like in the 435 WISEMAN JOHN 435 takes the book and suddenly goes pale.
WISEMAN JOHN: No.I sensed something had gone awry. The book's power. It's gone.
WISEMAN JOHN: When you removed the Necronomicon from it's cradle, did you speak the words?
ASH: Yeah. basically.
WISEMAN JOHN: Did you speak the exact words?!
ASH: Well, maybe not every single syllable, no. But basically I said them. Yes.
WISEMAN JOHN: Dung eating fool! Thou hast doomed us. When thou misspoke the words the Army of the Dead was awoke.
ASH: Hey. We had a deal. You told me, you could clean this thing up, once I got you the book. You said there was a passage in there that could get rid of this thing and send me back.
WISEMAN JOHN: The passage is useless to us as long as these evil dead walk. They have a terrible desire for this book. And they shall come here to get it. Once in their possession, the Evil shall rule the Earth for one thousand years.Because of you.we are You wanted the damn book. You got yer book. I did my part of the We did strike a bargain.

ARTHUR: The Wisemen were fools to believe that you were the Promised one. That one such as you could have saved us!.
SHEILA: I still believe that thou wilt help us.
ASH: No.. They're right. I screwed up. I didn't come through for you, and. I'm sorry for it.
SHEILA: I still have faith in thee. In my heart I know thou wilt still Sheila. It's over for me. I don't belong here and I'm going home. I didn't have what it took. It's over. He bows his head and moves off. A high pitched SHRIEK is heard!

SCOUT: An army of the dead! They have gathered in the wilderness and come this way.
ARTHUR: How far from here?
SCOUT: But two days ride.
ARTHUR: Then these winged ones are only the first of them.
WISEMAN: Perhaps we should go from this place while we can.
GOLD TOOTH: We could be safe in the mountains.
WARRIORS: Yes! To the mountains! We must flee! They'll take our souls!
ASH: Go ahead and run. Run home and cry to mama. I'm through runnin'. I stay we stay and fight.
ARTHUR: How will we stop an army of the dead at out castle walls? How will you fight that?! With more words? Most of out people have already fled. We are but forty men.
ASH: We'll get Henry the Red and his men to fight with us.
ARTHUR: We shall not stand in battle, alongside the likes of him. Our honor will not allow it.

HENRY: What of them?
ASH: They're headed towards Arthur's castle. We need your help. Fight with us.
HENRY: So you are a vassal of Arthur now? You have taken up sides with him against me.
ASH: The only side I'm takin' is the one that's gonna stop those Henry laughs.
HENRY: Why should I endanger my people to save my enemy?
ASH: Because after they finish with Arthur they'll come after you. Together, we've got a chance. Besides, you owe me.
EVIL ASH: Who rules?!
THREE TRUMPETERS: stand atop the castle wall and sound their trumpets! CAMERA PANS to reveal.
ASH: walks along, inspecting a line of forty medieval warriors who stand at attention. He halts before a warrior and stares hard at him. The Warrior glances towards Ash.

CLANG!: With a deft stroke, Ash's sword is flung from his hand.
KLANG!: The torch is knocked from Ash's hand. It falls over the edge of the wall and lands in the courtyard below. It ignites a fuse. The burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder. The sack sits upon the spoon of a catapult.
SKELETON ASH: swings his sword. Ash leaps over the blade. The Skeleton swings downward, and Ash side steps it.
SKELETON ASH: You're finished. He extends the Necronomicon to taunt Ash.
SKELETON ASH: I possess the Necronomicon. I've crushed your pathetic army. Now I'll have my vengeance! He raises his sword for the death blow.
