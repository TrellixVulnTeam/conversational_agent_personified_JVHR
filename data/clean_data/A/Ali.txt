TIME!: Cassius drops the rope where he stands, and walks off as Sam INT. THE HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - SAM COOKE segues into "Bring It On Home" and women in the front row reach out for him. The heat between Cooke and them is palpable. The first row is going crazy as.
ANGELO DUNDEE: INT. HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - HIGH + WIDE FRONTAL: SAM COOKE'S sweating. The place is rocking as.
TIME!!!: INT. HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - HIGH + WIDE FRONTAL: SAM COOKE'S sweating. The place is rocking as.
CASSIUS: Sonny Liston: you ain't no champ! You a chump! You want to lose your money, bet on Sonny. He know I'm great. He will go in eight!
A MAN: ( reading ) .210. Cassius Clay weighs 210 ( changes down ) You sure you got that right.?
CASSIUS: ( changes down ) You sure you got that right.?
THE MAN: 218. Sonny Liston.the heavyweight champion of the world weighs 218 Pounds of what?!
BUNDINI: Pounds of what?!
CASSIUS: Pounds of ugly! He so ugly, sweat run backwards off his forehead to get away from his face! C'mon, bear! I turn you into a rug!! Rumble right now, man!
SONNY LISTON: ( low ) Keep talkin', punk-ass faggot! I'll fuck you up like I's your daddy.
CASSIUS: You whup me, I'll crawl out of the ring on my knees and catch the next jet plane out of the country.
JIMMY CANNON: ( older reporter ) That a promise?
CASSIUS: ( to Jimmy Cannon ) .you be the first eatin' his words!
THE DOCTOR: ( alarmed, to Pacheco ) 210 over 110?! I can't let him in the ring in this condition!
REPORTERS: ( shout ) Liston says he'll talk with his fists. "Lip from Louisville." ( laughter ) .odds 7:1 against you. Big bet's whether he'll knock you out in the first round or third round or kill you altogether. You scared of him?
CASSIUS: I'm scared of no man. I give Sonny Liston talking lessons, boxing lessons and falling down lessons.
CASSIUS: "Black Muslim"'s a press word.
ANGELO DUNDEE: Man's religion's his own business. What kinda question's that?
ANGELO DUNDEE: ( sees ) .cannot stand you, Cassius. He really wants to kill you.
HOWARD COSELL: .cannot stand you, Cassius. He really wants to kill you.
CASSIUS: Howard Cosell, you are an instigator! How you get that way? When I'm done with Liston, I'm comin' for you!
DOCTOR: ( to Pacheco ) It doesn't come down, I cancel this fight. You call me in an hour with his blood pressure.
BUNDINI: ( entering ) I'm called Bundini, rhymes with Houdini. He was a Jew, too.some other people call me Fastblack.or Daddy Mac.
CASSIUS: Who Shorty?
BUNDINI: I call him Shorty 'cause he like 'em circumcised. Original people. Like Moses. And I was a babe in a basket, too. I was born on a doorstep with a note 'cross my chest that read, "Do the best you can for him, world." I had to suck the first nipple come along. I didn't run away from home.I been runnin' to home.
CASSIUS: .I study every fight. 'Til I got a plan. Wear him down two through four. Drop him in the fifth round. So the p'diction ain't a p'diction. It's a plan. And 'cause of all the poppin' off I do, I know I gotta win! That's the truth. And why I'm tellin' you?
BUNDINI: 'Cause I'm gonna be your Inspiration. Your motivator. In your corner. Can I be in your corner, young man?
CASSIUS: ( thinks, then ) ( inexplicably moved, Ain't spent much time in Miami. Where the water?
BUNDINI: ( inexplicably moved, Ain't spent much time in Miami. Where the water?
PACHECO: 120 over 80? You should be asleep.
EARLY EVENING: being wrapped. Cassius' shirt is off, sitting on a bench in the dressing room.the ritualistic tradition, having his hands taped. Dundee expertly does it. In the background, Bundini, Pacheco, Bingham, Rudy and Two Men in dark suits, someone from Liston's camp, and a State Boxing Inspector watch. Then, the door opens for Malcolm X, in a dark suit, thin tie. Cassius lights up. Dundee is done. The Boxing Inspector signs the tape. Then, Dundee puts on gloves and laces them while.
CASSIUS: When you get back?
MALCOLM X: Just now. I'm front row, seat 7.
RUDY: I'm gonna find Mom and Dad.
CASSIUS: You could have stayed. Nobody gotta hide when they with me.
MALCOLM X: Nothing wrong with being cool, my brother. You been working toward this moment for four years.
ANGELO DUNDEE: ( while tying ) He's right.
MALCOLM X: It's a crusade in modern times. And television is beaming if off Telstar to the whole world. So Allah has brought this about for a Salaam alaikum, my brother.
LISTON: right away throws a left that misses and attacks Cassius, throwing seven more that Cassius with extreme, awkward caution evades.
CASSIUS: throws his long left jab. It keeps Liston at a set distance. He has Liston's range, now, and he dances away from Liston's charges. Then, halfway through the round, Cassius' eyes have hunted out an opportunity, and he throws his first combination with a few hard shots that, to Liston's surprise, rock Liston's head back. And, then, Cassius easily evades.
LISTON'S: furious big misses to the left and right.
CASSIUS: keeps tagging Liston with his long left. And, now, infuriates Liston even more by merely walking away from Liston's big misses, provoking even wilder and more inaccurate Liston assaults. ( We're aware that any Liston shot could knock out Cassius if it connected. ) Then Cassius soaks up a couple of body shots, most flicks his jab, slides, dances, clinches, circles away.UNTIL.
CASSIUS: He was supposed to kill me. Well, I'm still alive.
LISTON'S LEFT: comes in like a freight train. Cassius merely leans away to avoid Liston, circles and now snaps off a flurry and OPENS A CUT UNDER SONNY'S LEFT EYE. Then, he splits out of there.
ANNOUNCER: ( at ringside, on radio ) He's opened a cut on Liston. Liston's never been cut!
CASSIUS: ( to Dundee ) He's nothin' to me.
CASSIUS: .my eyes!
CASSIUS: ( shouting ) My eyes! I can't see.somethin' in my eyes!
CASSIUS: ( his gloves ) Cut 'em off! Cut 'em! I'm blind.
ANGELO DUNDEE: No. You quit, it's over! Get out there. Be a yardstick. This is the big one, daddy. Get out there and run!
HOWARD COSELL: ( doing color radio .Clay, a round ago, looked like he'd about had it, but in round six.
CASSIUS: I upset the world! I am the greatest! I am the greatest!
HOWARD COSELL: What made him so easy for you?
CASSIUS: I told you. Didn't I tell you?
HOWARD COSELL: Was there any single point you knew you had him?
CASSIUS: I had him in the first round. 'Cause I'm the greatest! Sam. Hey, Sam! Let him up.
GORDON DAVIDSON: .I don't care what should have been ordered! We need a victory party right now. I got national press, the family, the champ, all kinds of folks. 250 to 300. Yes.
NIGHT: and others of the Louisville Sponsoring Group in a crowd of predominantly white people, drinking free drinks at the hastily arranged victory party, wait. Sportswriters.Jimmy Cannon, Red Smith. Cassius, Sr. is there. They all wait. No sign of Cassius. "Where's your boy?" A young New York Times sportswriter, ROBERT LIPSYTE, is there as well. He looks like he doesn't belong.his clothes are only perfunctorily conventional, and he's a generation younger.
GIRL: Why's he so scared?
MALCOLM X: Man, look at that guy run!
CASSIUS: The Mummy! "I can't get away from the mummy!" Yeah, but that mummy too slow to catch anybody.
SAM COOKE: Hey! The mummy always gets his man.
CASSIUS: No, he don't! Now, don't believe that stuff on Laughter from the outside. Cassius looks. He's not drawn to all the partying. Malcolm takes a picture with his Contax. Through the door enters Jim Brown. Jim embraces Malcolm and Betty, Sam Cooke, and congratulates the new champ and helps himself to food.
A REPORTER: The people look to you. Do you plan on being a people's champ, like Joe Louis?
CASSIUS: ( tentative ) Yeah. I going to be a people's ( beat ) But not like Joe Louis, exactly.
A REPORTER: ( starts ) Mr. Clay.?
CASSIUS: And I'm not Clay. Clay's the name of the people who owned by ancestors. I don't want to be called after that slave name no more. So I'm "X." Cassius X. And I'm a member of the Nation of Islam. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is my spiritual guide. Malcolm X is my This is hard news!
REPORTERS: ( all at once ) You a card-carrying member? Aren't Black Muslims a hate group?
CASSIUS: ( droll ) "Card-carrying".? Don't need no "card." You got a Christian card? 750 million people believe in Islam. I'm one of them.
MALCOLM X: This is the champ's time. And I'm here as a friend to celebrate his victory. So I got nothing you want.
CASSIUS: I'm going to be a people's champion. But I don't have to be the way you want me to be. I'm gonna be what I want. And I'm free to think any way I want.
MALCOLM X: I was leaving, saw the light on.how come you're up?
CASSIUS: ( mumbles, half-asleep ) .watchin' a show on termites.they knockin' down this house, here.
MALCOLM X: I been invited to speak at Ibadan University in Nigeria. C'mon with me?
CASSIUS: Six million in your house and you don't know it. Where?
MALCOLM X: Africa. You been there?
CASSIUS: Africa? No. Only Rome. Yeah, man, let's go!
MALCOLM X: Nkrumah stayed with me when he was a student in New York, so we'll stop in Ghana.
CASSIUS: When we leaving?
MALCOLM X: Next Thursday.
CASSIUS: ( sees ) What is it?
MALCOLM X: You ever been so angry.have you ever been so angry that you'd explode?
CASSIUS: ( after a beat ) Tore out a picture of Emmett Till when I was little. Couldn't take my eyes to it.couldn't look at it. Barb-wire around his neck to a 75- pound cotton-gin fan. Took out his eye. The cruelty to it.I couldn't look at it.couldn't throw it away.
MALCOLM X: What else?
CASSIUS: I thought, "What I do wrong to be so low that people could do that to people like me?" It made me feel ashamed. And that makes no sense. But that's what it was.
MALCOLM X: .when I heard about the four girls bombed in the 16th Street Church in Birmingham? The prohibitions of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad prevented me from speaking my voice in action. Because Birmingham was part of the civil rights movement, begging for a place at the white man's table. But dead children.are dead children. So the anger I felt, I had to contain. I locked that down! So tight my muscles seized. I lost control over the right side of my body. Leg didn't work.right arm didn't work. "I'm having a stroke," I thought. I had to hold it in 'cause I wanted, all I wanted was to BREAK SOMETHING! Break a part.any part of this system. Because you are so provoked as a human being. In your spirit. In your heart. At the death of children. But I COULD DO.nothing.
CASSIUS: You can fix that.
MALCOLM X: I don't know. I will try when we get back. Until then I will live each day as if I am already dead.
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD: Only after long service and high merit in the spiritual and physical rebirth of Afro-American people.is one granted an original name. But you are special. A world champion. So there is a gift I wish to give you. From this day forward you will be known as Muhammad Ali.which means "one worthy of praise," and Ali means "most high."
CASSIUS: ( a beat, sounding it ) Muhammad Ali. ( humble ) "Worthy of praise." Thank you!
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD: ( cautioning ) Be very careful what you say.your words reflect on the nation of Islam, now.
CASSIUS: Yes, sir.
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD: ( after a beat ) Up until now, I have entrusted your spiritual development to Brother ( beat ) I do not feel this is a wise course
CASSIUS: ( not a thought ) This is a great honor, Messenger.
A NEIGHBOR: One more. Thank you.
ALI: When the contract run out. I want black lawyers and managers. Chauncey Eskridge on North La Salle They saved you from the gangsters, from the jackals and the hyenas of boxing. Never cheated you. Protected you with a trust fund.
ALI: I don't need no "protectin'" from myself. Why I need protecting from myself by them.?
ALI: I ain't one of their thoroughbreds! Or their charity things. "Let's do somethin' for that well-behaved colored boy, Cassius." I ain't well-behaved nothing! I am a man.
ALI: That's right.
ALI: No one "made me".
ALI: ( anybody's son ) I made me. ( adamant ) No one's in that ring but me!
ALI: I know who I'm not.I'm not drinkin'! Goin' back on my wife! I am not prayin' to no blue-eyed, blonde-haired Jesus. I ain't.
ODESSA CLAY: And we realize it has gotten too dark to see.
ODESSA CLAY: You didn't get it from me.your words, your sense of humor, what makes you angry, what makes you a fighter. You got that from your You saying I'm just like him?
ALI: You saying I'm just like him?
ODESSA CLAY: I'm saying, if he was your age today, he'd do the same as you. And he knows that.
MALCOLM X: What is it, Joseph?
BETTY SHABAZZ: ( concerned for her husband ) ( after a beat, disconsolate ) Cassius won't be coming to Africa.not with me.
MALCOLM X: ( after a beat, disconsolate ) Cassius won't be coming to Africa.not with me.
BETTY SHABAZZ: Go anyway. Don't put it off. It's not safe here.
ALI: ( joking ) Hey, man, where they put the real pilot? What you doin' up here?
PILOT: ( not understanding; I am.the pilot. He's the ( moves map case ) Here, Mr. Clay, sit down.
ALI: No, man, I meant.in L'ville, when I growed up, they barely let black folks drive buses.
THE PILOT: Here we are. Cote d'Ivoire.Africa.

MARLIN THOMAS: Motor Pool, here, have a Chevy parts catalogue.?
ALI: in the three-car caravan, passes the huge triumphal arch with its giant black star on the top. Thousands line the route to see the heavyweight champion and cheer him. For Ali it's another kind of parade.
MALCOLM X: ( shouts ) Brother Muhammad.
ALI: Hey, man!!!
MALCOLM X: And I heard you were coming.

Dressed all the same, high and low, the same. Blonde-haired, blue-eyed Muslims. Arabs. Blacks. Yeah. All of them, Muslims praying together.
MALCOLM X: It's Marlin. You'll never guess who Malcolm ran into.
BRADLEY: ( in French; into phone ) Un moment.
BRADLEY: ( in French ) Il n'y a pas de quoi. Cela m'a fait grand plaisir. Faites-lui mes ( English translation ) It's nothing. Give him my compliments.
MARLIN THOMAS: Malcolm bumped into Cassius Clay. Muhammad Ali.whatever he calls I thought that was all over. Is Clay going to support Malcolm's U.N. I don't know.
BRADLEY: I thought that was all over. Is Clay going to support Malcolm's U.N. I don't know.

BRADLEY: Find out. We'll pick up on Malcolm in Liberia ourselves.
MALCOLM X: Drank from the well of Zem-Zem. And you should visit Cairo. I have friends there in.

ALI: She gonna be a Muslim, now! So fix it up, Herbert.
JOSEPH 13X: Why we meeting?

ALI: meets Liston, nails him with a straight right. Ali begins baiting him, dancing. Liston tries to cut off the ring, jabbing ineffectually. Ali lets Liston in, pulls back, then pivots on his right foot, throws a short right and RAMP INTO SLO-MO.to see Liston not see it coming.

LIPSYTE: ( reading ) Nixon, the Republicans, Boxing Commission in New York, Cleveland and L.A. ( a foregone conclusion ) But you're also getting attacked as unpatriotic by the NAACP, Roy Wilkins, Jackie Robinson, the New York Times and Joe Louis.
BOB ARUM: a New York lawyer and promoter arrives and climbs out of the Oldsmobile. Ali opens the door.but doesn't get out.
ALI: ( to Arum ) People are following me.
BOB ARUM: I got almost nowhere I can promote a fight for you. Plus, I think they're going to vacate you from the crown.
ALI: BOB ARUM
BOB ARUM: Yeah. If you're convicted.
ALI: They gonna take away what no fighter in the world can?
BOB ARUM: And New York may revoke your boxing You sure you want to do all this? Your next three to four years are every heavyweight's prime. And there are few of those years.
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE: You sure you want to do all this? Your next three to four years are every heavyweight's prime. And there are few of those years.
ALI: What 'bout Terrell?
BOB ARUM: We'll know if we can fight Terrell in Illinois this afternoon. Terrell's running his mouth. He said if you're called, you should Motherfucker. He got a deferment for bein' too tall, or havin' flat feet. Why don't he serve for me? Tellin' me what I should do.
ALI: ( angrily ) Motherfucker. He got a deferment for bein' too tall, or havin' flat feet. Why don't he serve for me? Tellin' me what I should do.
BOB ARUM: ( to Ali + Eskridge ) I got to get you some fights. Fast.
COMMISSIONER: You understand we could take away your license to fight Terrell in Are you prepared to apologize? About your unpatriotic remarks that you made?
ALI: Are you prepared to apologize? About your unpatriotic remarks that you made?
COMMISSIONER: Are you prepared to apologize? About your unpatriotic remarks that you made?
ALI: Apologize? No.
COMMISSIONER: You said that you were the people's Yes, sir!
ALI: ( angry ) Yes, sir!
COMMISSIONER: Do you think you're acting like the people's champion.?!
ALI: Yes, sir. I am not going to apologize to you. This isn't a courtroom. And I don't have to sit here and answer your questions.
ALI: I ain't draft dodgin'! I ain't goin' to Canada. I ain't burnin' my draft card. I ain't burnin' the flag. I'm stayin' right here. And you want to throw me in jail? Go ahead. I'll do my time. I been in jail four hundred years. I'll be in jail four, five more. But I ain't goin' ten thousand miles to help murder and kill poor people for you. 'Cause if I'm gonna die, I'll die now, right here, fighting you. If I wanna die. You my enemy, not Vietcong or Chinese or Japanese. You my opposer when I want freedom. You my opposer when I want justice. You my opposer when I want equality. You want me to go somewhere for you, but you won't even stand up for me in America, for my rights and beliefs, you won't even stand up for me here at home.
ERNIE TERRELL: ( getting on scale ) Tell Clay he can get on after me.
ALI: ERNIE TERRELL
ERNIE TERRELL: Get on the scale after.
ALI: ( cuts in ) What you call me.?
ERNIE TERRELL: Only thing I knows you as: Cassius Announce it right here or from flat on your back!
ALI: ( infuriated ) Announce it right here or from flat on your back!
ALI: What's my name, motherfucker?!
TERRELL'S: face is battered. Ali SLAMS in SHOTS.
ALI: ( to Judge ) If the court would give me my sentence right now instead of waiting and stalling.
JUDGE INGRAHAM: ( obliges ) My pleasure. The jury has found you guilty of refusing induction into the United States armed forces. I sentence you to the maximum sentence allowable.five years' imprisonment and a fine of ten thousand dollars. ( pause ) Fast enough? Your attorney will lodge an appeal. While you're out on bond, I order your passport surrendered. I'll not have you benefitting yourself by fighting
ALI: Watch now.
BELINDA: ( laughs ) See, you don't need to fight no more.
ALI: So what's fresh, girl?
BELINDA: ( smiles ) Everything fresh!
ALI: ( smiles ) What's the freshest of the freshest?
BELINDA: ( smiles ) Doughnuts just came out.
ALI: ( holds up the Feed me those things, I gotta come back as a wrassler. ( a ring announcer ) 645 pounds. I'd still be pretty.but I be fat pretty.
BELINDA: You don't remember when you met me once before.long ago.
ALI: ( joking ) I remember something. Wha's your
BELINDA: You know my name! You came to my school, right before you win the title. Interviewed you for the school paper. I was eleven.
ALI: You had a long braid.
BELINDA: Yeah! You called me little Indian girl, then.
ALI: That was you?
BELINDA: I loved you then, like all those kids. I never stopped. I still do.
ALI: You see the Ellis-Quarry fight?
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE: Yes. We'll be in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals next month. We'll lose. Then we appeal to the Supreme Court.
ALI: Ellis the champ? Man. I beatin' on him since we was sixteen. They give Ellis to Joe Frazier? Frazier'll kill him. Then they out of juice. Where's the gate? So they gotta let me fight. I fight Ellis in a phone booth.middle of Times Square.you think that draw a crowd?
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE: Draw a crowd or not draw a crowd, Muhammad, is NOT going to make a difference with your boxing licenses. They don't want you to ACLU's handling your case against the New York Boxing Commission. They discovered New York's got actual ex-murderers and ex-rapists currently licensed to fight. But revoked yours.?
ALI: CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE: No. State Department refused permission for the one-hour visa. No fight in Tijuana. Look.
ALI: Can't fight here. Can't fight outside the country.
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE: I know people in the restaurant business.want to start up a chain. Muhammad Ali's "Champ Burger"."Muhammad Malts," "Fist Full of Fries".all of that.
ALI: Why I want to be in the restaurant 'Cause you need the money.
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE: 'Cause you need the money.
ALI: How much all this gonna cost?
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE: Too much. They do that to you, too, you know.
ALI: ( to customers ) Look out!
CUSTOMER: Hey, champ!
ALI: Not then.
BELINDA: First time? 1961.Sister Khalilah introduced you at assembly. You said you would be heavyweight champion of the world by the time you were twenty-one!
ALI: I always tell the truth.
BELINDA: I was eleven. I interviewed you for the student paper. You called me "little Indian girl," 'cause I wore my hair real long, in a braid.I told you."Man, you scribble! You can't even write! You ought to go back to school until you do it better."
JIMI HENDRIX: ( from "All Along the "There must be some kind of way outta here, said the joker to the thief."
ALI'S FACE: grimacing through another set, trying to stay in shape, trying to retain skills going dormant.
JIMI HENDRIX: "No reason to get excited, the thief, he kindly spoke. There are many here among us, who feel that life is but a joke."
JIMI HENDRIX: "But you and I, we've been and this is not our fate. So let us not talk falsely now, the hour it's getting late."
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE: .struck out at the appellate level in New Orleans. So we're heading back to the Supreme Court.
ALI: Thought we already got turned down EXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE I'm petitioning on a conscientious objection basis. Religious belief. We'll petition that your sincere religious belief prohibits you from shooting people. I believe they'll hear that.
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE: I'm petitioning on a conscientious objection basis. Religious belief. We'll petition that your sincere religious belief prohibits you from shooting people. I believe they'll hear that.
ALI: Where the money come from, Chauncey? Herbert tell me I'm runnin' on empty. Put aside "how do that happen"? Licenses all revoked. No passport. I can't fight here. Can't fight abroad. And what happen if I lose the Supreme Court?
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE: It's all over. You go to jail for five years.
NIGHT: as if they were pointing at a burning fire, sirens, blue police flashers, an isolated gunshot. And REVEAL Ali on a rooftop, in sweatpants, sweatshirt, SHADOWBOXING while.
JIMI HENDRIX: "Outside in the cold distance, a wild cat did growl, two riders were approaching, and the wind began to HOWL!"
BINGHAM: Ellis doesn't belong in there.
ALI: ( curt ) Man give him a shot, he took a shot.
BINGHAM: I saw Bundini in New York.
ALI: How's he?
BINGHAM: .bad shape. You better get your belt b-b-back. Belinda brings coffee to Bingham.
BINGHAM: You call your parents, Ali?
BELINDA: No, he didn't. I told them about the one on the way.myself.
BINGHAM: You p-p-p-promised you'd call them.
ALI: I'll call 'em, I'll call 'em. May-may! It go in one end and come out the other.
BELINDA: You wanna try changing her, for the You so much better at it, mama.
ALI: You so much better at it, mama.
BELINDA: That happen, you promise me you put some new people around you.
ALI: I need Angelo, Rudy, Ferdie
BINGHAM: Ali, she's talkin' about "Brother" Ali stops. Between him and Belinda, this is important: her solidarity is with her husband, not with the NOI.
BELINDA: Where are they when we need them? You got Gene Kilroy droppin' off groceries like charity. Borrowin' money from my folks. So.?
NIGHT: ( still sweating ) Norton's big and strong, but.
FRAZIER: ( still sweating ) Norton's big and strong, but.
HOWARD COSELL: ( interrupting ) Hold on one second.we have a caller. Go ahead.
HOWARD COSELL: Let's tell it like it is. With your court and boxing problems, Muhammad, can you get a fight promoted?
ALI: I ain't interested in the paycheck, I'd fight Joe Frazier for free in a phone booth in Times Square, if I wasn't broke. I still will.
HOWARD COSELL: Did you say you were broke? How can you be broke?
HOWARD COSELL: You've made more money than all previous heavyweight champions combined. What about your management? Surely they have provided for you.
ALI: I'm saying it's time for everybody to quit lying! Muhammad Ali is the champ! I have to, I'll get the fight on myself. And if they offer me money, I ain't gonna turn it down.
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD: Get me my son, Herbert, on the
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD: Mr. Muhammad Ali desires to do that which the Holy Qur'an teaches him against. I am, therefore, suspending Mr. Ali from the practice of Islam. He may no longer appear in temple, pray or teach, or have any conversation with any Muslim whatsoever. Furthermore.he may no longer use the name of Muhammad Ali. Henceforward, he will revert to his old slave name, Cassius Clay.
BELINDA: You can't call me that no more.
ALI: You can't call me that no more.
BELINDA: Hell, I can't. I'm defying them by talking to you. And being with you.
ALI: Whyn't you call an ambulance or a Wouldn't let me. Said he knew you.and to call you, Mr. Ali. He's not been out for three days.
LANDLADY: ( following behind ) Wouldn't let me. Said he knew you.and to call you, Mr. Ali. He's not been out for three days.
BINGHAM: ( opens his eyes; half Watchu' doin' here? Gimme that short dog!
BUNDINI: ( opens his eyes; half Watchu' doin' here? Gimme that short dog!
ALI: What's wrong with you, man?!
BUNDINI: Nothin' wrong with me!
BINGHAM: A mystery.d-d-d-daylight.
BUNDINI: ( shielding his eyes ) Leave me alone!
ALI: I leave you alone. You called me!
BUNDINI: That were a week ago.
SMACK!: What you shame yourself like this for, maaan.?! Why you shame Bundini flails back with his arms. Ali leans in and SMACKS him again.
ALI: What you shame yourself like this for, maaan.?! Why you shame Bundini flails back with his arms. Ali leans in and SMACKS him again.
BUNDINI: Lemme alone! I'm flyin'! The Sky Chief talk through me. I know the word!
ALI: You know "low." You so low, the curb look like up!
BUNDINI: ( demonstrates ) Yeah? The king gotta go home to his throne! From the root to the Those rhymes is old. Forget 'em.
ALI: Those rhymes is old. Forget 'em.
BUNDINI: ( demonstrates more ) God don't care about you! Don't care about me! In all of everything, we mean nothin'. He don't know us. We be. And that's the onliest thing he did. And that's good 'cause that's why we free. But free ain't easy. Free is real. And realness is a motherfucker. ( low; almost spooky ) It eats raw meat. ( beat ) It walk in its own shoes. ( beat ) It does not waver. ( pause )
ALI: ( absent ) Forgive me, Muhammad. Take me back.
BUNDINI: Forgive me, Muhammad. Take me back.
ALI: No. There's no "back" to take you Ali gets up Bundini has been taken from him, too and INT. "EL" - ECU FRONTAL: ALI - NIGHT and beyond the side of Ali's face, elevated through the slums and decrepit tenements of the south side of Chicago.the mean alleys and decaying back porches. Men gathered around 50-gallon steel drums, burning wood for warmth. Everything is corrupted or has left him.
ALI: ( to himself ) .you can't do what you do best in the world. And how you feed your family? From prison? Who take care of your kids? And is Allah, is God with me?
HOWARD COSELL: ( loud ) Don't bother me. I'm a world- famous broadcaster and you're an ex-champion with diminished skills. I can't be seen you, it would be calamitous to my reputation.
ALI: Put me on, Howard.
HOWARD COSELL: Muhammad, I'd do anything for you. But I got bosses who only give a damn about Nielsen ratings.
ALI: I guarantee.it will be a historical and momentous night!
ALI: .what Heavyweight Champion of the World? I'm not the champ. I am retired, finished, out of the game. And I ain't gonna let myself grieve and suffer none. But I know I will not fight again.
HOWARD COSELL: I thought you were resolute in your resolve to regain your crown.
ALI: If tomorrow they say: "We want you to fight Joe Frazier. Madison Square Garden. Millions and millionses of dollars. Here's your license back." I will tell them: "I am sorry, but I am done."
HOWARD COSELL: What about Frazier?
ALI: You'll have to wonder.what me and Smokin' Joe would have looked like.
HOWARD COSELL: You surprise me, Muhammad.
ALI: Howard, you losing your hearing along with your hair? Don't put questions to it! I am through fighting. 'Cause I got a bigger and more important match comin' up. The U.S. government. A heavier contender.
HOWARD COSELL: Do you think you're going to jail?
ALI: I don't know, but it's going to be a shocking and terrible fight. In fact, they might wish they let me stay in boxing.
HOWARD COSELL: Joe Frazier told me on this show he would knock you out.
ALI: There you go, agitatin'. You ask Smokin' Joe what he been smokin'?! Joe Frazier even dream he can whup me? He better wake up and apologize. But, if I WAS to jump in the ring with Joe, here's what you might Ali comes out to meet Frazier, If Frazier goes back an inch farther, Ali swings with a left, Ali swings Frazier keeps backin', but there's It a matter of time before Ali Now Ali lands with a right, what
ALI: I don't wanna fight no more. Not with you.
ALI: Who dress you, Joe? You look like Dale Evans.
FRAZIER: Shut up. Get in.
ALI: To be closer to you, honey.
FRAZIER: Fuck you.
ALI: There be two undefeated heavyweight champions! And they ain't fighting!
FRAZIER: I wanna fight you! Said it a hundred times. The Man won't let you fight no more. What you complainin' to me for?
ALI: 'Cause you gotta get behind this and we gotta do this.
FRAZIER: We."gotta" do nothin'!!!
ALI: You wanna get this on, Joe? You and me? Or not?!
FRAZIER: What about your license?
ALI: I can fight in Atlanta.
FRAZIER: How's that? What about the Boxing Georgia ain't got no state boxing commission. And Atlanta got a black city council; a liberal Jewish mayor, Sam something. It all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta with Jerry Quarry. But we got to get the steamroller movin' now.
ALI: Georgia ain't got no state boxing commission. And Atlanta got a black city council; a liberal Jewish mayor, Sam something. It all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta with Jerry Quarry. But we got to get the steamroller movin' now.
FRAZIER: What I got to do?
ALI: You announce that if I beat Quarry you give me the title shot. So what you say.maaan?
FRAZIER: My daddy was a sharecropper. I worked in a slaughterhouse.right on that corner. I came up from What I got, I got with this. And I already got the title. So I got nothing to win and everything to lose.
ALI: But you know you ain't the champ yet.
FRAZIER: ( looks at him ) ( beat ) All right. You beat Quarry, I'll get inna ring and fuck you up.
ALI: ( turns away ) I'm fine. Thanks.
WIDER: Bingham takes pictures. Sarria, Rudy and the media in force are there for the start of Ali's comeback.
ANGELO DUNDEE: Ali goes to Angelo in his corner.
TIME!!: Ali goes to Angelo in his corner.
ALI: What you want?
BUNDINI: Take me back, boss.
ALI: You want me to take you back?
BUNDINI: I'm clean. And you a resurrection. This is God's act. Anybody love poor people and little people and fucked-up people gotta be a prophet.
ALI: ( quietly ) You can't hit what you can't see.
BUNDINI: ( quietly ) Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.
QUARRY: shakes it off. Reorganizes. Throws two jabs, a right to the body and tries to follow it up with a left hook. Ali ties him up. The ref separates them. Quarry comes in again. Ali throws a left cross over Quarry's right, which Ali leaned away from, and adds two rapid, glancing jabs to the same spot. And Ali OPENS A CUT. The BELL sounds, ending Round Two.
CROWD: goes nuts, that part that's pro-Ali: Atlanta's black elite and scattered whites. And the thunderous noise becomes one sound, one momentum, cheering their warrior saint, their defiant champion's return. And their ROAR becomes THUNDER.a momentum unto its own, driving.
BUNDINI: You the man! You Superman! Ain't no kryptonite in this ring tonight!
QUARRY'S EYEBROW: streams blood. Interposing himself between their arms.
REFEREE: stops the fight. Irish Jerry Quarry damned by skin that cuts and bleeds.
CROWD: goes nuts! Their champion has returned. ALI throws his arms in the air. QUARRY'S arguing not to have the fight stopped. Now he appeals to Ali!
ALI'S: picked up by Angelo. Bundini's run into the ring. Ali's arrived. He is coming back.
BELINDA: ( low ) .you don't need their management.
HERBERT: As-Saalam Alaikum.Brother Muhammad.
ALI: All praise to Allah. .Alaikum Salaam.
HERBERT: ( beaming ) The Messenger has lifted the suspension, Muhammad. Congratulations.
ALI: You saying I can be a Muslim again, I never stopped. Like I never stopped being champ.
HERBERT: ( cold ) I never stopped. Like I never stopped being champ.
ALI: ( cold ) I never stopped. Like I never stopped being champ.
HERBERT: I begged my father to reinstate you.
ALI: When? After I promoted Quarry fight? After I won it?
HERBERT: We can get you Frazier.
ALI: I already got Frazier.
HERBERT: We can get you five million dollars for Frazier.
ALI: Are we talking management, talking money or talking religion?
HERBERT: When you.
ALI: ( interrupts ) When I got leery and talked up how come I'm broke, then came the suspension. Now, you explain that to me, my brother.?
HERBERT: It's my father.
ALI: ( puts a hand on I love the Nation, Herbert. I love Elijah Muhammad. But it don't own me.
HERBERT: My brother!
ALI: Herbert and Joseph 13X leave.
BINGHAM: You b-b-becoming a Christian? Forgive and forget?
HOWARD COSELL: Muhammad, you T.K.O.'ed 'em.
ALI: What are you talking about, Howard? No. "The Supreme Court ruled today in the case of the United States vs. Cassius Clay, a.k.a. Muhammad You won an 8-0 unanimous decision. You're free.
HOWARD COSELL: ( reads ) No. "The Supreme Court ruled today in the case of the United States vs. Cassius Clay, a.k.a. Muhammad ( looks up ) You won an 8-0 unanimous decision. You're free.
ALI: I'm free.
ANGELO DUNDEE: What are you talking about?
ALI: Supreme Court set me free.
BUNDINI: That's 'cause they know the king is gonna go home to his throne. And they know everybody's with you, now. And they wanna be on the RIGHT side!
MICROPHONE: descends from the overhead lighting grid. The announcer's hand takes it.
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, fifteen rounds of boxing for the heavyweight championship of the world.
ANNOUNCER: And in the opposite corner, the current heavyweight champion of the world, Smokin' Joe Frazier.!
ALI'S EYES: deep in his focused concentration. His attention so arrow like it reminds us of the younger man in the Liston fight.pure purpose.
THE RING: .only SILENCE as the referee's instructions are given in SLO-MOTION. Ali bounces on the canvas. We HEAR his feet shift, turn, dance.and his breathing, expectant. Here comes the return of what was unfairly taken: his heavyweight MID-FIGHT - ALI looks swollen, out of breath. Something's wrong! Two solid Ali jabs and a right hook connect. But they slow down Frazier not at all. Joe Frazier, short and compact, like a pit bull, bobs and weaves his way inside Ali's longer reach.
ALI: ( to himself ) Hook's comin'. Lean back, man! Move back! WORK LEGS.!
FRAZIER: is wary. He doesn't trust Ali. He walks across the ring, allowing Ali to recuperate.THE BELL. Ali walks to his corner, drained.
ALI: is exhausted. Labored breathing. The crowd cheering Frazier.
ANGELO DUNDEE: Hell of a fight, champ.
ALI: Shut up! I lost. Get outta here.
RUDY: Go on! Everybody out!
ANGELO DUNDEE: ( to Pacheco ) Ferdie, take a look at this. ( to Ali ) It was still a hell of a fight.
ALI: Where's Belinda?
PACHECO: She fainted. They took her to the aid station. She's okay.
ALI: My hands was in sand, Angie. My feet in water.
ANGELO DUNDEE: Maybe we shoulda had more time between Blin and this, you know.to get back into.
ALI: Woulda, shoulda, coulda. After three-and-a-half years, this.from how far back.comeback is.
PRESS: Were you robbed?
ALI: I lost. You lose, you don't shoot yourself. The world goes on.
ANOTHER REPORTER: Joe said he didn't think you wanted to fight him again.
ALI: ( stops ) Oh, how wrong he is.
BELINDA: My God. They killed you!
PACHECO: Get away from her. What is that?
ALI: I ain't dead, baby! C'mon.
ALI: I can move my jaw with my tongue. He got me.
PACHECO: ( concerned ) It's broke. I think.I think your jaw's broke.
REFEREE: curious about the activity in Ali's corner, starts over.
PACHECO: nods to Dundee. Dundee starts to reach. Ali snatches Angelo's hand holding the towel. Angelo's about to end the
ALI: Ain't stoppin' nothin'.! Nothin' stoppin'.!
HERBERT: Now that Smokin' Joe's run out of tomato cans to beat up, I finally got Yank to commit to a rematch with you in about six months. Frazier said he'd be happy with three mil.
ALI: ( through still-wired- Foreman call me one time after he won the Olympics.
HOWARD COSELL: ( shouting )
BINGHAM: ( wry ) B-b-be easy gettin' a Frazier fight now. He ain't the champ of anything except getting knocked down.
NIGHT: grabbing. Holding. Ali's got Joe's powerful left tied up this time. A clinch. Separating. A punch. A hook. Clinching. They separate.
THEIR BODIES: Ali does a little shuffle, circles to keep Joe at hitting distance, lands a combination. Joe closes, but Ali won't let him in and ties up Joe. We hear a BELL and that's the end of the fight. Not a bang; a whimper.
REFEREE: holds up Ali's hand and mouths silently words we cannot hear. And as we MOVE CLOSER INTO ALI'S EYES, we see no exaltation. This is a victory, but a hollow one. It's a decision eked out.
ALI: ANGELO DUNDEE
ANGELO DUNDEE: So we only eked this one out. And George Foreman makes Frazier look like a sissy.
PACHECO: You see their fight?
HOWARD BINGHAM: You mean the Joe Frazier falling- down lesson?
PACHECO: And Foreman is 24. You are 32 years old. I don't want to see your head get turned into someone's .but, you go? We're the corner, same as always. But it ain't gonna be easy.
ANGELO DUNDEE: .but, you go? We're the corner, same as always. But it ain't gonna be easy.
ALI: ( to Angelo ) You think I still got the tools?
ANGELO DUNDEE: You got the tools, Daddy. But they Well, you better sharpen 'em up. 'Cause we goin' to Africa.
ALI: ( thinks; decides: Well, you better sharpen 'em up. 'Cause we goin' to Africa.
BUNDINI: The motherland. From the root to the fruit. We gonna rumble.in the jungle.
ALI: It's time to be heavyweight champion of the world again.
BUNDINI: Yeah, man!
DON KING: "Rumble in the Jungle!" That's the name I given it.
REPORTERS: Don. Zaire? Why not Antarctica? What's wrong with New York City?
DON KING: Because you miss the significance. I dream, as Martin Luther King once dreamt, that a man could be judged by the content of his mind. This is about black men helping black men, overcoming four hundred years of racial depression to the dawn of a new day of liberation.financial and otherwise.
ALI: Man, you crazy.
DON KING: Ten million dollars. With one stroke of the pen, you split the world's biggest emolumation of the history of sports!
ALI: ( to Zairian Official; What are they saying, man?!!! Why they saying that?
ALI: What's that mean?! I don't understand!
ALI: ( can't hear ) ( has to shout ) It mean."Ali, kill him! Ali, kill him!"
MUHAMMAD ALI: is overcome. This is all for him. He is their hero. He defied the world's powerful. They tried and could not destroy him. His defiance made him their champion. And now he has come to contest his rightful title against the numb instrument of the all-powerful. He raises his arm, too, and
ALI: Ali, boma ye!
DAWN: plus two trainers and the ever-present Zairian POLICEMAN, Lt. Nsakala. The early paints the red-earth ochre.
ALI: ( to himself ) Fast. Six left jabs flash from his chest and shoulder, followed by a right hook and left and right ( to himself ) Back up, maaan. ( weaves suddenly; .you fast!
KIDS: Ali, boma ye!
ALI: ( repeating ) Ali, boma ye George Foreman!
ALI'S: still jogging. Behind the signs, he becomes a magnetic attraction. People are surprised to see Ali. He's making their day. Euphoric kids parallel him, run with him, follow PAST ALI: the concrete-and-cinder-block walls to the dusty, bare ground are chromatic. Primary colors. Ethnographically ALI SEES interiors. Broken walls. No roof. No plumbing. People come from a ditch with a shower curtain for privacy, surprised to see Ali. Faces indifferent to squalor. This is the ethnographically "interesting" surface of what, in fact, is civic disintegration starting to occur. It is the human concomitant to 13 years of Mobutu kleptocracy.
ALI: looks at the backs of the signs. He and we realize the signs' purpose: to hide the makeshift plastic walls and rooms made from cardboard containers and oil drums from the foreigners traveling the road to Kinshasa. One TEENAGER WITH A WITHERED ARM and a big smile runs up.
TEENAGER: ( broken English ) You beat them, Ali!
ALI: Foreman? I kill him!
ALI: looks at individual faces. A grinning OLDER MAN with a blue transistor radio ( we'll see him later ). A smiling kid. A girl with no shoes. A teenage kid jumping up and down.all looking at him. Ali makes four pieces of rope appear. He rubs them together.
ALI: ( to himself ) .even if I die here. If it kill me, no matter what.I gotta win.
ALI: Howard! How many you ugly sportswriters in there got me over Foreman? Don't lie.
HOWARD COSELL: ( beat ) Some of us.Norman, me.are worried. How you gonna dance against George?? He's sparring with a middleweight, training to cut you off. He gets you against the ropes, he can knock you out with either hand.
ALI: ( drops facade ) What's the odds?
HOWARD COSELL: Two-and-a-half-to-one. Against. We're worried you're going to get hurt.
ALI: This'll be the biggest upset since Sonny Liston. I want all of you to write it down! This fight is no
HOWARD COSELL: Muhammad, I'm sorry. I have to ask. Are you really fast enough, anymore? To beat George Foreman? Many people believe you don't have the same skills, that you are not the same man you used to be ten years ago.
ALI: Howard. I didn't want to talk about this, especially in front of everybody. But I talked to your wife! And she told me you're not the man you used to be.two years ago!
DICK SADLER: holds the bag. Foreman throws hooks, one after the other. Each blow rocks Sadler. George is literally punching a hole in the bag. These blows would mash an opponent's liver, break ribs, destroy kidneys. This man can do more than hurt you. This man can kill you.
FOREMAN: darts left and jars him with three left jabs, keeping him on the rope. Foreman's training to defeat Ali's dancing, his "float + sting" tactics.
ALI: Salaam Alaikum, brothers! The champ is here!
BELINDA: Here's your water.
ALI: Bottled water. Frozen steaks. Brought all this stuff like Africans don't have steaks.
BELINDA: You could pick up parasites.
ALI: They eat it.
BELINDA: You're seeing what you want to see, Mobutu eats it.
ALI: Mobutu eats it.
BELINDA: Mobutu is taking care of Mobutu and stealing all the wealth and sending it to Switzerland.
ALI: ( pause ) So? What's that do with any of why we here?
BELINDA: ( she doesn't get it ) We're here 'cause Don King got Mobutu to put up ten million dollars. Don King don't give a damn about Africa. He worse than Here come "Herbert."
ALI: Here come "Herbert."
BELINDA: Yeah. 'Cause where was he when we was broke and borrowing money? And Bundini and all them that "love you"? Disappeared, is where they All over you when you got it and drop off you when you don't.
ALI: Money? I do "money-making" whenever I want. Money is easy.
BELINDA: ( running on ) And Don King fit right in.that double-breasted hipster is now a dashiki-wearing rip-off.
ALI: Don King delivered the first black- promoted championship fight in Africa!
BELINDA: Don King talks black, lives white and thinks green! Why you defending him and "brother" Herbert?
ALI: 'Cause clean-cut Muslims parading on the South Side of Chicago don't get this done! I got to put honkeys with connections and bad- ass niggers to it, too.
BELINDA: ( not hearing ) And now they got you up against George Foreman. Do they give a damn you could get killed?
ALI: That what this is? Think I gonna lose? Puttin' doubt on me?
BELINDA: ( tears flow ) I think: why is my Muslim husband letting himself get strung up on a cross.? It means, "tell me."
ALI: I'll be back before the fight. If that's all right, my husband.
BELINDA: I'll be back before the fight. If that's all right, my husband.
ALI,: Angelo and Bingham in the empty seating, looking at the ring under the canopy. Behind them is the rehearsal. Meanwhile.
AISLE: Don King and entourage approach.
DON KING: ( over the drumming ) Champ! Champ! George had an accident.
ANGELO DUNDEE: ( suspicious ) What are you talking about?
DON KING: Got cut. Right above his right eye. His sparring partner's elbow. Split it open, so.
ANGELO DUNDEE: Can he fight?
DON KING: Not for six weeks.
ANGELO DUNDEE: Are you tryin' to pull something, Don? Ali wants his title. And he wants it back in Zaire. George leaves, he ain't comin' back. George don't like it here.
DON KING: How right you are, my suspicious and short Italian brother. And my fiduciary responsibility to this first all-black promotion is like a garden in the African sun. It must grow! It must bloom! It cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to some dome. Like the Astrodome, the Super-dome, any dome outta Zaire, where it be deprived of light and bled of water. 'Cause what gonna bleed.is money. A hemorrhage of cash. .blood on the floor. Double hotel costs. Double travel costs. Airplanes. Food and beverage.
ANGELO DUNDEE: ( rhetorical ) What do you expect us to do, Don?
DON KING: ( moves close to Ali ) Muhammad. Find a way to get George to stay. Be Moses in reverse: do NOT let my people go! Stay the fuck right here, in Egypt, if you'll pardon my Swahili.
BINGHAM: DON KING
DON KING: Lingala. They s-s-s-speak Lingala.
BINGHAM: Lingala. They s-s-s-speak Lingala.
DON KING: Who cares?
ANGELO DUNDEE: ( pissed, dissed big ) If George goes? You forfeit five million. You crawl back to Cincinnati. You ain't promotin' a charity raffle.
DON KING: ( irrepressible ) If George goes? George goes, my champion, I will get you Joe Frazier. Ali-Frazier III.the fight everybody want to see.
ALI: ( interrupts ) Truth is.George knocked hisself out.
DON KING: ( double entendre ) You bad!
ALI: I'm a bad man!
DON KING: Ain't no doubt about it.
ALI: And you tell the same thing to George.
DON KING: ( laughs to dismiss We will reschedule the fight, and to ensure George is ready, we are thinking of postponing from September 24th to October 30th.
REPORTER: What about the concert, Don?
DON KING: That would go off as planned on September 22nd and 23rd.
ALI: ( skeptical ) Uh-huh. I want all helicopters guarded! Private boats. Private jets. I want the airport I'm serious I want President Mobutu and all his paratroopers. Mobutu and all his paratroopers. I want all of you "Zaireans" to be on guard! Watch all strange boats tryin' to slip away! They might be takin' him out.
ANGELO DUNDEE: The bus station. It's Ali kidding on the square. A serious point delivered not seriously to be taken seriously.
ALI: Yeah. Watch the bus station. Watch everything! Elephant caravans. He might sneak out by BUNDINI thinks of a line and whispers it to Don. Don leans past Dundee to pass it on Ali.
ANGELO DUNDEE: What you say?
DON KING: I ain't talkin' to you!
ALI: ( to King )
VERONICA: I don't think so.
ALI: What's your name?
VERONICA: Veronica Porche.
ALI: Like the sports car.
VERONICA: ( laughs ) But with a little something extra. ( beat ) Veronica, I know you now. C'mere, sit down.
ALI: But with a little something extra. Veronica, I know you now. C'mere, sit down.
VERONICA: Don brought me here, but I'm not The others are paying them no attention. Bundini stands to talk to Howard Cosell. There's an ocean of side conversations. Ali's presentation to Veronica is natural, open admiring. It is not seduction. It's more seductive than seduction. She feels from Ali nothing predatory or exploitative.only the warm rays of the sun from his open face and appreciating eyes. Still holding her hand.
ALI: Where you from?
VERONICA: L.A. But my people are from Louisiana. We're Creole. So I'm African, French, Spanish, my mother's grandfather was Jewish.
ALI: ( looking at her Well.they all came together real You know. ( hesitating; low ) .I'm glad you said what you did. You made sure this fight stays here.
VERONICA: You know. .I'm glad you said what you did. You made sure this fight stays here.
ALI: All them writers in there think Foreman gonna.kill me! What you think?
VERONICA: Ali, boma ye.
PLIMPTON TYPE: .she's an African "succubus." Means witch doctor.
BUNDINI: Succubus? Suck my dick. They ain't room in Africa for more than one witch doctor. And that's B'dini.
ALI: You been to Hong Kong? Taiwan? I can't go there. All the ladies out there from Indonesia, Japan, Hawaii, India. "Ali-i-i-e-e-e! Ali-e-e-e! Oh, Muhammad Al-i-i-i!" You seen those people from Thailand? I was in Bangkok I couldn't walk. I couldn't.I just couldn't do nothin'. "Get me outta this The women were so pretty.
VERONICA: I can't go there. All the ladies out there from Indonesia, Japan, Hawaii, India. "Ali-i-i-e-e-e! Ali-e-e-e! Oh, Muhammad Al-i-i-i!" You seen those people from Thailand? I was in Bangkok I couldn't walk. I couldn't.I just couldn't do nothin'. "Get me outta this The women were so pretty.
ALI: I can't go there. All the ladies out there from Indonesia, Japan, Hawaii, India. "Ali-i-i-e-e-e! Ali-e-e-e! Oh, Muhammad Al-i-i-i!" You seen those people from Thailand? I was in Bangkok I couldn't walk. I couldn't.I just couldn't do nothin'. "Get me outta this The women were so pretty.
BINGHAM: 'B-b-b-bout Hong Kong, man?! You know what I heard?
ALI: ( interrupts ) Ladies in Thailand, their hair comes down to their knees.and they about Veronica's complexion.and they bad!
NEWS CAMERAMAN: ( to Veronica ) Let's go for a ride.
ALI: ( to Veronica ) Let's go for a ride.
VERONICA: squints, trying to figure out how he did it, because.
ALI: shows the scarf, pushes back his cuffs so that he can't hide anything up his sleeves. His wrists are bare. He shows both sides. Now, he takes the scarf and pushes with his right hand and feeds it into the closed fist of his left. He looks up wide-eyed at everybody. Then, he opens his fingers and the scarf is not there!
ALI: So why you glad we still here?
VERONICA: Holdin' this in Africa make people proud. All over the world. They're proud of you. Anybody can fight in Vegas.
ALI: That's one job. I got two.
VERONICA: Islamic faith help you to that?
ALI: Listen, girl, as a Muslim, I am busted out and failed in the eyes of God. I shoulda discovered Islam at 50! 'Cause I am weak on women. They take my eyes and my heart follow.causing me to be a lovin' husband and a terrible husband.! .green eyes and cocoa skin.? .okay, rest of me, let's go!!
ALI: ( to himself ) Faster! Faster!
DUNDEE: ( shouts )
TIME!: Ali SLAMS a right hook at the bag. It almost explodes. OPTIONAL: Ali takes body hits, tries sliding off head shots.
HOLMES: You can't lead a right hand. Not at him!
ALI: Why not?
HOLMES: Too long.to get it there. Man, I mean, to think you could hit him with a right lead.it's insulting. Nobody would lead a right.
BUNDINI: meanwhile, has thrown his arms around Dick Sadler, Foreman's manager. ( We realize this is why Ali segued from serious work to snapping his traditional left jab. )
BUNDINI: I got him! Lock him up.
SADLER: ( laughs ) Hey, hold up, chump! Make this chump turn me loose.
ALI: Hey! Look! Look at George Foreman's trainer, feelin' me up on purpose! On the side, to see if I'm in shape!
IRENE: Can I have your autograph?
ALI: We'll, you ain't gonna find no fat! Watch out!!
SADLER: ( lunges for wife's Give me that thing!
BINGHAM: ( breaking through ) Muhammad. Give her an Ali button!
SADLER: No, you ain't. All right, give my wife an Ali button.
ALI: She's gotta put it on.
SADLER: Give my wife one.
BINGHAM: Bo'dini, you got Ali buttons?
ALI: "George" buttons is all I got. In my bedroom! All over the bed! Everywhere! To remind me.of all of ya'. All of ya'! Reminds me of all ya'!
ORTF INTERVIEWER: ( in French ) Pardon. Vous êtes de l'ambassade des Etats-Unis? Vous avez une ( English translation ) Excuse me. You are from the U.S. Embassy? Do you have a prediction?
ORTF INTERVIEWER: ( English translation ) Excuse me. You are from the U.S. Embassy? Do you have a prediction?
BRADLEY: ( in French ) ( caught; smiles ) Je suis avec l'Agence américane d'informations. Il ne m'est pas permis d'exprimer mes préférences entre deux citoyens des Etats-Unis.
BRADLEY: ( English translation ) ( caught; smiles ) I'm with the U.S. Information Agency. I'm not allowed to take favorites among two United States
ANGELO DUNDEE: ( meaning Sadler ) He gone?
ALI: EXT. COMPOUND - SADLER - DAY leaving, steals a glance at Ali and Dundee. It's adversarial. The camaraderie was not false. Both are true. But being strategic, he is a threat to Ali. George has a first-rate team.
BELINDA: Hello, Muhammad. Bingham. Mr. Cosell.
HOWARD COSELL: ( tight ) Hi.Mrs. Ali.
ALI: When did you get in?
BELINDA: Just now. Muhammad, may I have a word with you, please?
BELINDA: What is going on?
ALI: You know what's going on.
BELINDA: But I don't have to have it thrown in my face. I don't have to read about it and have people call me up on the phone about it.
ALI: I didn't mean for it to come out.
BELINDA: Oh, hell, Muhammad, you got no discretion. You never did. You humiliate me!
ALI: I know that.
BELINDA: Then why you got to be visible with I didn't mean for it to be.
ALI: I didn't mean for it to be.
BELINDA: I live with the casual ones. But this, this.I can't hold it together anymore.
ALI: I don't want to hurt you. It's wrong. You're a good wife to me.
BELINDA: Then why do you disrespect me this I respect you. I always respect you.
ALI: I respect you. I always respect you.
BELINDA: Do you love her?
ALI: I follow my heart.
BELINDA: "You're following your heart"? That's what you do. No matter what anybody says. Or thinks. Or what it does. And what happens now?
ALI: I fight George. I didn't come this far to quit.
BELINDA: Neither of us did.
BINGHAM: Belinda looks up, tears in her eyes.
MOBUTU: in his tan uniform and signature leopard-skin hat enters, followed by an entourage of aides.
MOBUTU: ( in French ) Invite Monsieur Idi to join me now. The Banker? The American?
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA: ( from doorway ) Countdown! Countdown!
RUDY: Countdown is on, bro. Five minutes.
HERBERT: enters. Ali and Herbert go to an alcove.
ALI: Thanks to Allah.
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA: ( shouts ) Four minutes!
ANGELO DUNDEE: Give us a moment. Alone. Hey. This is my religion!
ALI: ANGELO DUNDEE
ANGELO DUNDEE: Where you at?
ALI: ( looks up ) Foreman ain't no mummy. He's knocked out eight out of eleven before the end of the third round. He the most dangerous fighter I ever fought.
ANGELO DUNDEE: I'd worry if I was hearin' anything
ALI: And I can't WAIT!
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA: Three minutes!
ANGELO DUNDEE: Dance. That's the most important.
BUNDINI: throws towels across Ali's shoulders. Ali puts on his long African robe, which is white with African-graphic trim on the cuffs of the sleeves and the hem.
BUNDINI: ( whispers ) Forget every battle of man against man, of mind against mind, of soul against soul. This is the one. This is the greatest.
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA: Two minutes!
BUNDINI: The prophet's come back to claim his own! Get the pretender off that throne!
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA: ( shouts ) One minute!
THE PEOPLE: Ali! Ali! Boma ye, Ali! Ali! Boma ye!
THE PEOPLE: Ali, boma ye! Ali, boma ye! Ali, boma ye!
ANGELO DUNDEE: George is playing prima donna. He wants to make you wait.
ALI'S FEET: do a shuffle. He feels the canvas. He feels the soft spots. The firm spots. He feels how much slide there is because of the resin on the canvas, how much spring there is in the sheds his robe, now, and throws a blistering array of jabs and hooks. The crowd goes nuts. Ali looks ringside and sees.
ALI: sheds his robe, now, and throws a blistering array of jabs and hooks. The crowd goes nuts. Ali looks ringside and sees.
CROWD: Foreman! Foreman! Foreman! Foreman!
DON KING: as tall as only three other men: Foreman, Ali and Bundini, walks into the ring wearing black.
ZACK CLAYTON,: the referee, moves to the center of the ring. A great roar fills the air: "ALI, BOMA YE! ALI, BOMA YE! ALI, BOMA YE!".another one. "FOREMAN! FOREMAN!"
OVERHEAD: as Ali, Foreman and both their crews meet in the center of the ring.
CLAYTON: Now, both of you know the rules. When I step back, I want a good, clean break. No hitting below the belt, no kidney punches, no.
ALI: Motherfucker, you 'bout to discover you ain't nothin'.
CLAYTON: Ali, be quiet!
ALI: ( past the ref; You been hearin' about me for years. All your life you been hearin' about Muhammad Ali. Now you gotta face me.
CLAYTON: Ali, I'll disqualify you. Now, I want a good, clean, sportsman fight.
ALI: ( to Foreman ) You never should have come to Africa.
CLAYTON: ( blows up ) All right!! ( beat ) Now go to your corners and come out fighting when you hear the bell, and may the best man.win.
ALI: ( to himself ) Legs heavy.air's heavy.like sand.
ANGELO DUNDEE: .keep moving. Don't let him put you into the corner. Stay off the
ALI: turns away. Nevertheless, it crashes into his jaw.
MACRO ALI: TIME SLOWS. He ties up George. We SEE Ali's hurt. Dazed. But he must make George believe he's unhurt.
ALI: That all you got.? That it?
LOW ANGLE: George's shots are taken on Ali's elbows and gloves. But for every four that are thrown, one or two tremendous hooks get through to Ali's ribs, his side.
ALI'S FACE: reveals impact, but nothing diminishes the TERRIBLE FORTITUDE with which he endures. Now, he ties up George. Now, George drives Ali into the corner and pummels him.
ANGELO DUNDEE: Get off the ropes! Get off the ropes! Get off the ropes! Dance!
ALI'S EYES: alive, more than alert, the sharpest eyes in boxing.
ALI'S EYES: are bright like stars. His white mouth guard shines. A grimace? A grin?
ALI: ( to himself ) There is nothin'. Nothin'! ( another Foreman .I cannot take.
ALI'S CORNER: is apoplectic.
BUNDINI: Dance, dance!
DUNDEE: Get off the ropes! What are you Here come George's "murder" round.
ALI: ( it gets quiet; to Here come George's "murder" round. ( refers to Round Three )
ALI: ties up Foreman's left in the crook of his elbow, and they stagger, married, awkwardly, into the center of ring. The referee separates them.
ALI: George! Show me something.
FOREMAN: suddenly switches.
ALI'S: hurt! He holds on.
FOREMAN: throws a right hand. It, too, slams through Ali's guard. He's in trouble.
ALI'S EYES: flash. Roll in his head. He sees neon. TIME SLOWS.lights
ALI: ( calmly ) .been here before.
ALI: ( to himself ) Open the door, Richard.outta this room. Put on your coat, man.get out.
ALI'S CORNER: ANGELO DUNDEE ( panicked )
ANGELO DUNDEE: ( panicked ) Get off the goddamn ropes!!
ALI: Took somethin' away from him, Angie, that round.
BUNDINI: You gotta move! Stick and MOVE!
ALI: ( to himself ) They don't know what's happenin'.
ALI: covers with gloves at his head. Elbows at his ribs. When head shots come in, Ali slips them the right or left, or turns them into glancing shots, or just leans straight back so that they all fall short by quarter of an inch. The BELL.
ALI: covering, taking the most powerful hooks Foreman's thrown in the fight, one after the other to the body.
ALI: ( to himself ) Take it! Terrify him with what you can take.
FOREMAN: desperate, pounds a left to Ali's side, a blocked left to the head, three lefts to the belly, which get through! Ali's left arm convulses downwards, involuntarily, with the blows. What Ali's not ready for and doesn't block is the right hand that follows. This shot is jarring and concussive. He grabs Foreman's neck and has to hold on.
ALI: ( hisses to George ) Eight more rounds. You runnin' outta gas?
ALI: ( to himself to George ) .can't let you get that second wind which you don't know is out there for you.
FOREMAN: gets in a couple of lefts that Ali deflects. Ali takes another on the cheek, leans way back again. Suddenly, he seems tired, as is Foreman. Tied up, they go diagonally to the other corner of the ring, both fighters exhausted, leaning against each other. Resting. BUT.
FOREMAN: backs Ali into the corner.
ALI: hits Foreman with a left. Foreman launches a short left that Ali counters with a BIG RIGHT CROSS that connects.
FOREMAN'S: head snaps around. Sweat sprays in a parabola of light. Crowd ROARS with expectation. George Foreman tries a right uppercut, fails as Ali circles, guiding Foreman onto the ropes. Foreman's on the ropes NOW.
ALI'S EYES: know the moment is.
ALI: ( to himself )
ALI'S: short, chopping right turns Foreman's head down.
RIGHT NOW!: wrestles Ali into the center. And the most significant moments begin.
FOREMAN: wrestles Ali into the center. And the most significant moments begin.
TOTAL CHAOS: Ali is seized by Rahaman, Dundee, Bundini. And in the corner, hardly seen by anybody, Ali, now, faints. Veronica, with a DON KING AIDE, is overcome. Tears stream down her face.
NIGHT: celebrate. The city is crazy with the air of liberation in the rain. People are drunk, bowing to one another, extending their arms and legs in strange gestures. Laughter. THUNDER is deafening in the downpour. People celebrate despite the storm, dancing on sidewalks on Rua Absini.
BRADLEY: ( in French ) Ce soir, le Zaire a été le sujet central dans le tous les centres européens. Félicitations, Monsieur le Président pour la vie.
BRADLEY: ( English translation ) Zaire was the center of the world tonight in every banking capital, all over Europe. Congratulations, President for Life.
MOBUTU: ( then in Lingala to
LONDON BANKER: What's on the menu.?
ALI: ( low; about them ) I don't know what's gonna happen. ( beat ) Maan, everything is crazy.
BELINDA: .I didn't come this far to quit.
ALI: You think you got a chance, chump? Now you in trouble.
