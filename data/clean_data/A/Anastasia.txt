SONYA: ( whispering ) Princess Anastasia - you're late and it's all my fault!
ANASTASIA: Don't worry, Sonya, no one'll notice. . .

ON TATIANA: in a large throne-like chair. Tatiana is very serious and very regal. She slides over to make room for Anastasia who sits next to her.
TATIANA: Why were you so late tonight
ANASTASIA: I was showing Sonya something . . .
TATIANA: What were you showing her?
ANASTASIA: ( sheepishly ) How to read.
TATIANA: I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
ANASTASIA: I know, but I had to because . . .
ANASTASIA: ( cuddling ) Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
TATIANA: It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .

ANASTASIA: "Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
TATIANA: When you're older . . .
TATIANA: Until then, whenever you hear this song, think of me and know that I'm waiting for you.
GROUP SHOT: as PEOPLE in the ballroom look around bewildered. Then, a WHIRLWIND kicks up, sending everyone off the dance floor, as the whirlwind becomes a TORNADO. Suddenly, an ALBINO BAT ( BARTOK ) with huge eyes, springs out of the funnel, screeching and swooping over the crowd, causing everyone to duck and cover their heads in The tornada reaches it's peak and EXPLODES in smoke - leaving RASPUTIN standing alone in the middle of the floor. He is of indeterminate age, towering over other men in the room, his most striking feature are his eyes - which at this moment are burning a fiery red. He is dressed in a flowing black monk's robe with a satin rope tied around his waist. Connected to the rope is a glowing RELIQUARY, a mystical lantern.
VARIOUS SHOTS: of Nicholas, Alexandra, Sophie and Vladimir, Dmitri peeking out ofthe wallpanel, Tatiana and Anastasia, all of whom are frightened.
NICHOLAS: as he gathers his son and wife to his side
NICHOLAS: Rasputin! You're alive . . .

YES!: ( honestly ) I had nothing to do with it!

RASPUTIN: You gave the orders!
NICHOLAS: I did no such thing!
RASPUTIN: After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL
ANASTASIA: Anastasia leaves Tatiana and rushes to stand in front of her father. Still holding her Music Box, Anastasia's shaking hands are the only thing that gives away her fear. Rasputin spins toward the voice.
NO!: Anastasia leaves Tatiana and rushes to stand in front of her father. Still holding her Music Box, Anastasia's shaking hands are the only thing that gives away her fear. Rasputin spins toward the voice.
ANASTASIA: We're not afraid of you!
RASPUTIN: ( furious ) You . . . my little babushka . . . you'll be so much fun to kill that I'll save you for last!
RASPUTIN: THIS IS THE END OF THE ROMANOV LINE - FOREVER !!!!
PULL BACK: to see the PORTRAIT, a huge FRIEZE which covers an entire entire wall, singeing as the FLAME creeps up the nearby drapery, tinting the room in a red glow. A SCREAMING MOB, some in uniform, some not, has crashed into the palace and is heading up the stairs. A few in the mob fire off orange RIFLE SHOTS.
ANASTASIA: My music mox!
TATIANA: Anastasia, no!
TATIANA: Hurry, child!
DMITRI: No - this way!
DMITRI: Tatiana goes in as Dmitri shoves Anastasia toward the passageway, knocking the music box out of her hand. She reaches for it, but hearing the mob voices growing closer, he pushes her through the panel without it.
ANASTASIA: Hurry, Grandmama!
TATIANA: Get on! Anastasia, get on!
UP AHEAD: A MOB OF REVOLUTIONARIES block the tracks with a TRUCK
ON ANASTASIA: who pushes Tatiana up the stairs of the caboose. This puts Anastasia a few steps behind as the train speeds up. Tatiana is gripped by other passengers as she reaches out to Anastasia.
TATIANA: Grab my hand!
ANASTASIA: Don't let go!
CLOSE ON: the TWO HANDS. then suddenly. her small hand is pulled from Tatiana's grasp and falls out of the frame.

CLOSE ON: ANYA, 18, pretty despite the boy's hand-me-down clothes she is forced to wear, is busy scrubbing the floor. Unlike the others, she is determined not to let her surroundings get to her. She hums a tune. The door suddenly SLAMS open and GREGOR, 8, and clearly terrified, comes running in followed by COMRADE PHLEGMENKOF - a huge woman carrying a switch.
GREGOR: Anya! Anya!
PHLEGMENKOF: You can't get away from me now . . .
ANYA: Don't touch him.
PHLEGMENKOF: ( to Anya ) You ragged, skinny, little nothing! I have had just about enough of you . . .
ON PHLEGMENKOF: who first sniffs under her raised arm, then realized the cause of the stench . . .
SEREBREAKOV: I need. . . a worker.
ANYA: About as bad as you smell! No, no, Comrade - you don't want her . . .
PHLEGMENKOF: No, no, Comrade - you don't want her . . .
SEREBREAKOV: I want her.
PHLEGMENKOF: That's horrible, skinny thing?! She's crazy - she has no memory of anything before she came here! She didn't even know her name! That one is a rotten troublemaker, willful. . .
SEREBREAKOV: I'll break her will. . . I shall come for you tomorrow at dawn. You will enjoy serving under
PHLEGMENKOF: I couldn't break you - but he
GREGOR: ( loudly )
ANYA: No. I'm running
LITTLE GIRL: Running to? Running to what?
ANYA: To find my home.
CHUBBY GIRL: But you are home.
ANYA: No. This isn't a home - it's just a building. Home is where you belong and none of us belong here.
GREGOR: Where is your home, Anya?
ANYA: I'm not sure but look. . .
ANYA: It says "Together in Paris". I was wearing this when I came here ten years ago - it's the only way that I know . . .
CHUBBY GIRL: Is your home in Paris?
ANYA: It might be. I have to go and find out. ( Anya's "I want" song ). Anya SINGS SOFTLY to the

GREGOR: ( worried ) But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
ANYA: Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
GREGOR: ( nervous, sad ) Anya! What if we can't find anyone who loves us?!
ANYA: Then come find me.
ANYA: I think you should be more careful about who you invite to
ANYA: Could someone tell me. . .
PEASANT 1: End of the line!
ANYA: Which line?
PEASANT 2: Any line.
PEASANT 3: All lines are good lines.
GUARD: Very good. . .
ON ANYA: as she gets closer to the window. She turns to the person behind her.

PEASANT 4: Travel? Travel to where?
ANYA: To Paris. I have to get to
PEASANT 5: Paris?! What do they have in Paris that they don't have Shorter lines?!

ANYA: ( to herself ) Dmitri? There must be a million Dmitris. . .
FOLLOW ANYA: as she wades into the crowded street. Meetoo getting tangled in the legs of waiting Soviets. Anya stops suddenly. She sniffs the air. Her eyes widen as she recognizes the stench that is floating through the air. She spins around and sees Serebreakov
PEASANT 9: ( to Peasant 10 ) Which line is this?
PEASANT 10: The line to get into the line.
ANYA: Excuse me, do you know Dmitri. . .
PEASANT 9: I know nothing!
PEASANT 10: PEASANTS 9 & 10 ( whispering simultaneously )

A SIGN: "Pushkin Street"
ACTRESS 1: ( over the top ) Oh, Grandmama! It's me, Anastasia! I've waited so long to see you!
REVERSE ANGLE: to see the "Old Woman" is Vladimir, with a shawl over his head. He looks older, of course, but with the same dapper mustache. He rolls his eyes.
VLADIMIR: ( out to audience ) Dmitri! I can not work with ( to Actress ) May I remind you that you are supposed to be Princess - not a lazy lumbering lout!
DMITRI: Vladimir, calm down!
VLADIMIR: This, my friend, as an exercise in futility! We shall never find a girl to play the Princess Anastasia out of this motley crew of commoners!
DMITRI: For a ten million rubles reward we can look a little longer. This is the big one. . . and all I need is the right girl. ( Dmitri's "I want" ) Dmitri SINGS a reprise of Anya's
ACTRESS 2: ( heavy hasal ) Oh, Grandmama! It's me, Anastasia. I've waited so long to see you.
ACTRESS 3: ( stupid ) Oh. . . Grandmama it's me. Anastasia, I have waited so long, too. ( as a good-bye ) See you!
ACTRESS 4: Oh. . . Grandmama. . . It's me. . .
DMITRI: I wouldn't be on the outside anymore. The ten million rubles would make me welcome anywhere. I'd really belong somewhere - if I could just find the right girl.
ACTRESS 5: Oh, Grandmama. . .
ACTRESS 6: ( very intense ) What's my modivation?
ON VLADIMIR: ( calling out to seats )
VLADIMIR: ( calling out to seats )
ACTRESS 7: Oh. . .
ON DMITRI: in a state of disbelief.
DMITRI: I've gotta find the right girl!
DMITRI: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG ART THEATRE Anya rides up to front of the theatre and drops her bike. She rushes the steps.
VLADIMIR: It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
DMITRI: We will. We Come on, Vlad - she's out
DMITRI: She could be right under our
DMITRI: ( over reacting ) Ouch! That really hurt!
ANYA: I'm sorry. . . I'm. . .
DMITRI: got there, boy. In her old hand-me-down boys clothes andhat pulled low, she could easily be mistaken for a boy.
ANYA: ( breathless ) I'm looking for Dmitri. I need traveling papers - to Paris. I heard Dmitri could help me.
VLADIMIR: Who did you hear it from?
ANYA: I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them! Do you know Dmitri?
VLADIMIR: ( loudly, acting ) Providing travel papers is ( then, quietly ) I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you. Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
ANYA: Well, I don't have any money . . .
VLADIMIR: Good day!
ANYA: I have a bike! Perhaps I could sell it and. . .
POLICEMAN: Nonsense. There is no crime in the Soviet Socialist Republic.
ANYA: Sorry, boy, I have to go.
ANYA'S POV: the PALACE in the distance, only now it's run down, boarded up and partially burned. Anya is taken back. She stares, fascinated by it - moved by it . As the sun sets behind the Palace, it's bathed in a beautiful golden light.
VLADIMIR: . . . even if we find her, what makes you think the Empress will even see us?
DMITRI: She'll see us.
BARTOK: You, uhh. . . hang here often? "Hang" get it? I said "hang" and we're both, you know, cause we're bats. . . and, uhhh. . . what's your sign?
DMITRI: ( off noise ) What was that?
VLADIMIR: That was your dinner! I do hope there is no cabbage in Whatta' ya say we go somewhere - maybe get a bug to eat. Get it? A "bug" to eat, 'cause we're. . .
BARTOK: Whatta' ya say we go somewhere - maybe get a bug to eat. Get it? A "bug" to eat, 'cause we're. . .
ON ANYA: who jumps, startled, as Meetoo pulls the curtain and it hits the floor.
ANYA: What are you do. . .
ANYA'S POV: Behind the curtain was the FRIEZE of the ROMANOV FAMILY. The moonlight hits the portrait with a ghostly glow. "ONCE UPON A DECEMBER" ( THE MUSIC BOX THEME ) Anya is mesmerized by the FRIEZE. She looks around the Ballroom. . . almost remembering something. . .
ANYA: ( singing )
HORSES PRANCE: THROUGH A SILVER STORM FIGURES DANCING GRACEFULLY ACROSS MY MEMORY.
HORSES PRANCE: THROUGH A SILVER STORM FIGURES DANCING GRACEFULLY ACROSS MY MEMORY.
DMITRI'S POV: Anya is caught in a ray of moonlight, directly in front of the image of Anastasia in the frieze. The resemblance is striking. Dmitri is taken aback, but Vladimir is unaffected.
VLADIMIR: You're trespassing, boy!
ANYA: I. . . I. . . spoke to you earlier about traveling paper. .
DMITRI: ( whispering to Vlad ) It's her.
VLADIMIR: He's her?
DMITRI: Vladimir looks at Anya again and get it.
ANYA: Are you Dmitri? I didn't mean to trespass - I don't want to do anything dishonest, but if you could just help help me. . .
VLADIMIR: Perhaps you heard of our brilliant plan to find a girl and. . .
DMITRI: ( quietly to Vlad ) She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
VLADIMIR: ( gets it, whispers ) Ew. . . the honest type.
DMITRI: ( off frieze ) You look like her. Like the Princess Anastasia. Has anyone ever told you that before?
ANYA: ( sarcastic ) Oh, yeah - in the orphanage they constantly told me I looked like a princess! Stop
DMITRI: People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive. That makes her an orphan too
ANYA: I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
DMITRI: You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution. Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
ANYA: I don't know. I don't see what this has to do with me.
DMITRI: Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
VLADIMIR: How much do you weigh?
ANYA: Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
DMITRI: Why do you want to go to Paris?
ANYA: ( defiant ) I have my reasons.
DMITRI: Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris. We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris.
ANYA: Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . . Look at me!
DMITRI: NO! YOU LOOK AT HER! LOOK AT It could be you.
HER!: ( beat, then softly ) It could be you.
ANYA: ( singing in a whisper )
DMITRI: Find out the truth - come to Paris with us.
ANYA: All right. I will go with you.
DMITRI: The Her Royal Highness Princess
ON BARTOK: having watched the whole thing - he sighs.
BARTOK: Oy. . . he's gonna be so mad. . .
BARTOK'S POV: The city lights fade and we move into the blackness of the Russian forest. Finally, in the distance, we see the orange glow of a fire.
ANYA: ( singing in a whisper )
DMITRI: Find out the truth - come to Paris with us.
ANYA: All right. I will go with you.
DMITRI: The Her Royal Highness Princess
ON BARTOK: having watched the whole thing - he sighs.
BARTOK: Oy. . . he's gonna be so mad.
BARTOK'S POV: The city lights fade and we move into the blackness of the Russian forest. Finally, in the distance. we see the orange glow of a fire.
BARTOK: Ummm . Father Gregori? It's, uhh . me. Bartok. Phew! Not home .
RASPUTIN: Oh my God! Don't do that . feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here .
BARTOK: Oh my God! Don't do that . feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here .
RASPUTIN: ( smiling ) And what do you want, my little
BARTOK: Name calling! That's mature.
RASPUTIN: I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
BARTOK: ( strangled ) No, I really like my tongue. we're very attached. ( rasputin releases him ) Oyyyy. Okay, now. promise you won't get angry.
RASPUTIN: ( sweetly ) Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
BARTOK: Yeah, right. Keep that thought okay? So, I'm in town, stop by the old palace. You get a better class of bats there - no tattoos or anything.
RASPUTIN: Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
BARTOK: Okay. you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is . still alive.
RASPUTIN: Impossible. That rumor's been around for years.
BARTOK: Trust me, it's her!
RASPUTIN: ( eyes narrowing ) How do you know?
BARTOK: Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which is natural . Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute .
RASPUTIN: ( with reverence ) Source of my power. Owner of my soul. I need your help.
BARTOK: Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
RASPUTIN: I cursed then all!
BARTOK: My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound.
RASPUTIN: The Romanovs tried to kill me and I swore to destroy all of them! If she lives, if she should have a child someday, the Romanov Family continues! And I won't lot that happen! THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE!
BARTOK: You know, this is really obsessive behavior. There is this doctor this doctor in Austria, Sigmund something and he feels. . .
RASPUTIN: YOU IDIOT
YOU IDIOT: Rasputin makes a sad leap, grabbing it seconds before it shatters on the floor. Rasputin holds it up. The smokey SPIRITS inside swirl around, moaning.
BARTOK'S POV: From under the glass, Rasputin looks distorted and even more horrifying.
RASPUTIN: ( to Bartok ) Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
BARTOK: ( voice under glass ) You'd lose your security deposit?
RASPUTIN: ( waving reliquary ) Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once. well .
BARTOK: Ohhh, that was dumb.
RASPUTIN: Finish my prophecy. Ew, I hate when he does this!
BARTOK: Ew, I hate when he does this!
RASPUTIN: She is not to get off that train. alive!
RASPUTIN: Go! I don't care what you do with the others but finish the girl! KILLLLL HERRRRR! And have fun.
CLOSE ON: TATIANA'S HANDS covering her face. Slowly dropping her hands down to reveal an older, sad TATIANA.
TATIANA: Take her away, Sophie.
PULL BACK: to reveal a YOUNG WOMAN standing in front of bar desk.
TATIANA: Haven't anything better to do than to break my heart.
SOPHIE: ( very rapidly ) Oh, oh. I must say. I thought that one was bar - i'm just so shocked that she wasn't real well, she was real, I mean she was human, of course. but not our real. I must say, even my sisters were touched by her yes - yes they were.
TATIANA: ( stopping Sophie with No, Sophie. My heart can't take it anymore! I will see no more girls claiming to be Anastasia.
DMITRI: Hurry up with those papers.
VLADIMIR: Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
DMITRI: ( correcting ) "Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
VLADIMIR: What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
DMITRI: ( to Anya ) Wake up!
VLADIMER: We have a lot of work to do.
ANYA'S POV: Come on!
DMITRI: Come on!
DMITRI: Take my hand!
DMITRI: Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
ANYA: Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
DMITRI: I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
ANYA: By pulling my hair?!
DMITRI: I was all out of dynamite!
ANYA: ( hands Dmitri the snow ) Put it on your nose. For heaven's sake, you're making such a fuss!
ANYA: ( to herself ) Men are such babies.
ANYA: Here, let me
DMITRI: You're a princess.
VLADIMIR: Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
VLADIMIR: Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
DMITRI: Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
GUARD: Everyone rustles for their papers. Dmitri confidently pulls out their papers, done in beautiful BLACK ink. Then, he glances at the PERSON NEXT TO HIM and sees that his papers are done in a bright RED ink. Dmitri looks over at Vladimir - who has seen the mistake as well.
VLADIMIR: ( sheepishly ) It's what I hate about this government - everything in red!
GUARD: Thank you, Comrade Zhivago.
ZHIVAGO: Doctor Zhivago.
VLADIMIR: What do we do now?
DMITRI: Pray he's color-blind.
GUARD: wait here.
ANYA: I'm going to stretch my legs
DMITRI: That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs . stretch then that way.
ANYA: ( to herself ) I must have hit him harder than I thought.
GUARD: That's them! Come on!
DMITRI: Wait here!
ANYA: ( to Vlad ) Would you like to tell what we are.
DMITRI: Come on up!
ANYA: Vladimir picks Anya from up from tobehind and hoists her up to Dmitri. She hollers.
ANYA: Just what do you think you're doing?!
DMITRI: Trying. to. breathe.
DMITRI: The guards! I'll explain later.
TUNNEL: They drop down, this time Vlad in on his stomach. Anya and Dmitri realize his butt won't clear the tunnel. They push it down.
DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY Rasputin stares at the scene in his reliquary, watching his well laid plan go up in smoke", and lots out a simmering growl. Anya is standing with her hands an her hips arguing with Dmitri and Vladiair.
ANYA: Forged papers! Now, what?!
DMITRI: Now just get off the train.
ANYA: Dmitri motions that they are going to Jump. Anya shakes her head slowly.
HUH?!: Dmitri motions that they are going to Jump. Anya shakes her head slowly.
ANYA: She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
VLADIMIR: She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
DMITRI: Come on, we'll jump together. Take my hand.
DMITRI: Come on!
ANYA: With his outstretched hand, Dmitri shoves her off the bar.
VLADIMIR: I think I have hurt my.
DMITRI: You must enjoy causing me pain!
ANYA: You shouldn't have pushed us!
VLADIMIR: Is everyone all right?
ANYA: I'm fine.
DMITRI: She's fine! I may never walk right again, but she's fine.
BARTOK: the blood rush to my head. Rasputin pulls him back in, then speaks to his reliquary.
RASPUTIN: She's too far away, isn't she?
BARTOK: Oy. not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
RASPUTIN: We'll catch her and finish her! We ride this night!
BARTOK: Well, we wait this night!
VLADIMIR: No have a lot of work to do, Anya! Come along, Meetoo!
ANYA: Who's Sophie?
VLADIMIR: ( lost in warm memories ) Ah . the Lady Sophie. The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress . your grandmother, I mean.
ANYA: Dmitri, not paying attention, slams into the back of Anya. Anya, not hurt, turns to Dmitri - who is rubbing his now sore shoulder.
DMITRI: You are the Princess.
VLADIMIR: We're just going to refresh your memory.
ANYA: I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess! Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not
DMITRI: What do you see?
ANYA'S POV: her smudged face and boy's clothes. Dmitri's hands come into frame, wipe off her face with snow and them pull her hair off her face. Anya does, truly, look pretty.
VLADIMIR: Ah! Let us begin!
ANYA: .and on my father's side, there was [THIS SECTION IS NOT LEDGABLE]
DMITRI: Every Russian family has one..
ANYA: ( gets it ) Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Did I tell you that?
VLADIMIR: Did I tell you that?
ANYA: You must have.
ANYA: ( repeating ) .fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . . ( can't remember, then
DMITRI: ( hinting )
ANYA: The dessert fork!
VLADIMIR: ( lost in a memory of Ah, yes . I have always loved that fork.
ANYA: What a beautiful ship!
DMITRI: It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
VLADIMIR: Oh, yes it was the seagoing vessel of elaborate elegance in entertaining. A party boat. It once belonged to .
ANYA: Konstantin Petrovich of Moscow!
ELDERLY DOWAGER: No, no, boys! You don't know where he's been!
VLADIMIR: Come out! I can do alterations.
VLADIMIR: I shant!
DMITRI: I won't laugh - I swear.
ANYA: You said you wouldn't laugh!
DMITRI: It's not you - it's the dress!
ANYA: ( to herself ) I'm never going to be..
END MONTAGE: STILL IN THE SCENE Vladimir walks over to Anya and nervously chatters ( he knows he interrupted something ) as he leads her away from Dmitri.
VLADIMIR: You are a natural! I don't know how you ever learned to dance that well! That must have been some high class orphanage .
REVERSE ANGLE: just as a BOLT OF LIGHTNING STRIKES the water, we see Rasputin's face.
DMITRI: I wanted to show you something.
ANYA: It's so beautiful . and sad.
DMITRI: Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
ANYA: Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
DMITRI: Yeah . well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
ANYA: I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
DMITRI: Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution I never had much, but what I did have I lost.
ANYA: I'm sorry.
DMITRI: ( false bravado ) Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
RASPUTIN: ( low, slow ) She's out there .
BARTOK: I'm getting a chest cold..
RASPUTIN: Bartok. a question.
BARTOK: I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead.
RASPUTIN: What do you think is the most humiliating way to die? Rasputin's eyes light up as if he just thought of the answer to his own question. Bartok is thrown out of his beard when he makes a sudden turn and leaps off the wagon. Bartok follows.
BARTOK: My cousin Mischa, nice fellow had some dental problems - you didn't want to watch him eat, let's put it that way. Rasputin steps in
BARTOK: . anyway, a bunch of other bats were hanging in the belfry - I know, cliche, but there you have it, and Mischa, not the brightest bat in the world, decides to hang in the bell. Which was fine for awhile until it started ringing . ( shivers ) Ewwww, what a mess .
RASPUTTN: ( to reliquary )
BARTOK: And it didn't help the tonal quality of the bell, either. IMAGES, horrifying and frightening, begin to spin into a small tornado. Rasputin throws open the door and the TORNADO bursts out streaking across the water.
PULL BACK: REALITY: Anya has climbed over the railing of the deck and is looking into the black ocean. smiling.
DMITRI: If you have to go - wake her.. Dmitri looks over to Anya's bed - she isn't sits up and throws his legs over the side
DMITRI: What were you doing?! Anya puts her hands to her mouth in shock, shaking and almost crying with fear, she throws her arms around Dmitri and holds him tightly. Dmitri is surprised at first, but tightens his arms around her.
BARTOK: Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
RASPUTIN: ( controlling ) She leads a charmed life, that little one . Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now . it's him.
BARTOK: Nice looking fellow. I mean, don't get me wrong - I'm not attracted to him in the physical sense, I just . But Rasputin's not interested, he stares into the reliquary and speaks directly to it.
RASPUTIN: You are toying with me, aren't you? You let me get so close. The reliquary, as if in answer, seem to be chuckling. Rasputin smiles and joins in with it.
BARTOK: Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces? Rasputin returns the reliquary to its cabinet.
RASPUTIN: We are going to Paris - and while we're there, let's kill the young man. He annoys me.
ANYA: Oh! I'm sorry.
DMITRI: It's okay. Didn't hurt.. Vlad has been watching as he walks down the plank with Meetoo - they exchange an "oh boy" look, both noticing that clearly something is different between Anya and Dmitri. Anya catches something out of the corner of eye and turns quickly. CLOSE ON a sign: "Paris 30 kilometers" Anya walks away from Dmitri and over to the sign and looks at it longingly.
ANYA: ( to herself ) I'm almost there. I'm finally going to know.
DMITRI: How is our current financial status?
VLADIMIR: If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic. As he says this the ELDERLY DOWAGER from the ship passes by with her TWO OBNOXIOUS PUG DOGS. Meetoo growls as Vlad and Dmitri get an idea.
DMITRI: It worked in Odessa. Vladimir picks up Meetoo and whispers instructions. Meetoo likes the plan.
NEW ANGLE: as Meetoo races past the PUGS. They ignore him, so he stops and makes a face, giving them a sloppy "razzberry", which piques them a little. Meetoo then bends over and waves his furry little butt at them. Now the PUGS are offended and TAKE OFF after him, yapping all the way. Meetoo turns and scrambles with the Pugs in hot pursuit. As they get closer, Meetoo SUDDENLY STOPS and the Pugs go FLYING OFF they edge of the dock and into the water below. Meetoo looks over the edge and gives them a 'Boy, are you guys morons look as the ELDERLY DOWAGER runs up screaming.
ELDERLY DOWAGER: Help! My little dogs! Chevalier! Maurice! Hold on, darlings! Dmitri comes running up, a little too gallant.
DMITRI: I'll save them, Madame Dmitri dives into the water as Vlad rushes up behind the Elderly Dowager. Anya watches from a distance as Dmitri climbs out of the water carrying the soaked ( and pissed ) Pugs.
VLADIMIR: Such bravery! Why, that man should be rewarded! Amply rewarded!
MINUTES LATER: Dmitri hands Vlad a pile of FRANCS as Anya approaches.
ANYA: That was really very kind of you. She gives him a kiss on the cheek and walks away with Meetoo, who turns back and gives Dmitri a look. A little guilty, Dmitri turns to Vlad.
VLADIMIR: I won't say a word.
DMITRI: Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana..
ANYA: Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana..
DMITRI: You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong. and beautiful . even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know. Anya smiles at Dmitri, knowing that all the confidence she has is because of him. She takes his hand but looks away.
VLADIMIR: May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
SOPHIE: Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days! Anya looks to Dmitri, a little confused by that last comment. Dmitri makes a little "she's slightly crazy" They all leap to avoid her butt as she bustles into the house.
SOPHIE: I'd just like to ask you a few questions, dear. Sophie opens a huge book that SLAMS open. Vlad and Dmitri jump.
ANYA: Of course.
SOPHIE: Where were you born?
SOPHIE: ( almost giggling ) This is the hard one . what rare treat was served on the night of the Three Hundredth Anniversary of the Romanov Dynasty? The last ball they ever had?
ANYA: Father had fresh tropical fruits sent in. Oranges and pineapples from the far east. I remember . I remember I threw an orange to a young boy who was hiding under a Dmitri is shocked. He know this is Anastasia Romonov and he can't believe it.
SOPHIE: ( shocked ) Yes . yes, it was fresh fruit. Well, maybe not "fresh" Estelle got one rather brown banana but .
CLOSE ON: Dmitri, as he stares at Anya as Sophie prattles on.
MINUTES LATER: Anya sits near the window, stroking Tillie . much to the consternation of a jealous Meetoo., She looks out the window and sees Dmitri, deep in thought, wandering in the garden. OUT OF HER EARSHOT at the other end of the room, Vladimir speaks to Sophie.
VLADIMIR: Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
SOPHIE: Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
VLADIMIR: Then, you'll take her to see Oh, heavens I must say. no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
SOPHIE: Oh, heavens I must say. no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
VLADIMIR: Perhaps you could convince her?
SOPHIE: Oh, heavens, no. but . ( Vlad-leans closer as Sophie shares a naughty secret ) She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French. they only go to see which dancers will defect. She rises heading towards Anya. Her butt knocks over a vase, which Vladimir deftly catches.
SOPHIE: Come my dear, we've much to talk about.
VLADIMIR: We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! But it's not the money, Vlad.
DMITRI: But it's not the money, Vlad.
VLADIMIR: ( shocked ) Are you feeling all right?
VLADIMIR: Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl . and then you lose her.
DMITRI: What do you mean?
VLADIMIR: Dmitri . You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana. well, it's over. nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a Dmitri understands this and is devastated. Vladimir pats him on the back as he walks into the house.
ACCORDION PLAYER: FLOWER SELLER
FLOWER SELLER: Ooh la la!
PAN DOWN: to the "other side of the tracks, a run down area next to the Seine River. Rasputin's wagon is parked on the edge.
BARTOK: ( singing, a cappella )
MONTMARTRE: WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE Shut up!
NEW ANGLE: showing Rasputin trying to concentrate on the reliquary.
BARTOK: Sorry, it's just. you know I saw these french postcards once and. ooh la la . well, I'm not sure about the "ooh", but it's the "la la" I'm really lookin' forward to. Right, I'm shutting up.
RASPUTIN: We're close to her, aren't we? Excited, eh? You look about to burst . You'd like to burst, wouldn't you?
BARTOK: What do you think? Is it me?
VLADIMIR: Compliments of Sophie. Her escort has to look his best.
ANYA: How do I look?
DMITRI: Fine. We better go.
ANYA'S POV: Dancers in bright costumes leap across the stage. Dmitri turns to Anya and gestures to the box seats to the left. He hands her the opera glasses.
DMITRI: Look. There is your grandmother.
ANYA'S POV: The majestic Tatiana, flanked by Sophie and her sisters and backed by several large GUARDS in uniform.
ANYA: She's so beautiful! I do remember her . I remember her .
INTERMISSION: The lights come up and people around them begin to stand up, stretch, etc. Dmitri turns to Anya.
DMITRI: Come on. It's time..
ANYA: I'm so scared.
DMITRI: Don't be
ANYA: And grateful. To you. If it weren't for you
DMITRI: ( upset, pulling away )
DMITRI: I need to speak with the Dowager Empress .
[PAGE MISSING]: TATIANA ( CONT. )
DMITRI: Please, if you'd just listen.
TATIANA: ( to guards )
DMITRI: Please! Empress! It's not what you ..
DMITRI: Anya. . . please. . .
DMITRI: Anya, wait!
ANYA: ( spinning on him )
DMITRI: No! Well, yes, but
ANYA: No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
DMITRI'S POV: Tatiana is walking toward her car. A very proper CHAUFFEUR holds the door for her. The CHAUFFEUR helps Tatiana in, then is about to climb into the front seat when Dmitri rushes up to him.
DMITRI: Sir! Your rear tire is flat!
CHAUFFEUR: it is?
TATIANA: Ulo! Slow down!
DMITRI: I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
TATIANA: ( recognizing Dmitri )
TATIANA: Stop this car!
DMITRI: Please don't be afraid! I'm sorry, but there was no other way!
TATIANA: Anastasia's music box. She had this all these years. You could have found it.
DMITRI: What I
TATIANA'S POV: Anya holding Meetoo in front of the window.
ANYA: Go away!
TATIANA: Who are you, child?
ANYA: ( crying )
TATIANA: Do you remember this?
ANYA: I remember something lost . I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have. belonged to you .
TATIANA: Oh! Where did you get that?!
ANYA: I've always had it. I came here because of this! Tell me if you recognize it! Please! It's all I have.
TATIANA: ( through tears ) ( then suddenly: angry, defensive )
THE TRUTH!: Anya takes the music box and the key out of Tatiana's hand gently - remembering how it works. Anya puts in the key and begins to wind it. Tatiana is surprised that Anya knows how it works - so is Anya!
ANYA: ( remembering )
BOTH: AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
BARTOK: He is gonna yellllll.
BARTOK: I should have been a dentist .
ANYA: . and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
TATIANA: Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home.
RASPUTIN: Yesss . finally "home". And what a charming . girlish little home it is. Look, Bartok, little angels, the symbol of . love. So sweet, so
CLOSE ON: some CHERUBS as the smoke hits them. They begin to change, taking on a lean and evil look. Their tiny arrows grow, becoming lethal, as their eyes turn from soft brown to blood red. Slowly, they EMERGE from the wallpaper, their small wings growing into horrible pterodactyl membranous paired appendages. They SWOOP into flight and begin to circle the room, faster and faster. Rasputin leans precariously over the sleeping Anya, chuckling.
TATIANA: Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear.
ANYA: ( shaken )
TATIANA: ( comforting )
SOPHIE: A grand ball for the Princess. How very exciting. So much to do, so little time.
TATIANA: ( slightly annoyed )
SOPHIE: Caterers . invitations . saber dancers! We must have saber dancers!

ANDRE: Beeg. Zat is how you say it. And the crown she is . how you say?

DMITRI: No. Empress, you
TATIANA: I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
DMITRI: Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry.
TATIANA: Young man, I.
DMITRI: . and I'm going to keep my promise to stay out of your lives, forever.
TATIANA: You are the boy .
DMITRI: ( uncomfortable )
TATIANA: That last night in the palace. one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you? Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
DMITRI: Promise me she'll have her home.
TATIANA: She does.
DMITRI: And tell me that she's happy.
TATIANA: Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could. Dmitri comes down the steps, then stops when he sees Anya, wearing her CROWN. She turns and sees him, stifling her first impulse, then putting on a show of supreme confidence.
DMITRI: I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
ANYA: I'm glad you did too.
ANYA: Enjoy your fortune.
VLADIMIR: But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
DMITRI: Watch me.
VLADIMIR: So where will you go?
DMITRI: She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
NEW POV: from outside the window. WE DO NOT HEAR THEM, but we see Vlad and Dmitri hug good-bye.
PULL RACK: to see it's RASPUTIN'S POV; as he stands on a LADDER OF SMOKE, looking into Dmitri's window. Rasputin watches Vladimir leave as Dmitri finishes packing.
RASPUTIN: So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
DMITRI: ( recognizing him )
RASPUTIN: I know, I know . you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
DMITRI: What do you want?!
RASPUTIN: The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the.
DMITRI: You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the.
RASPUTIN: STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
ON BARTOK: who looks away, obviously not enjoying this. As WE HEAR Rasputin repeat "You are going to help me" a few more times.
MAJOR DOMO: . then as I say "Her Serene Highness Princess Anastasia" you, your Highness, should walk out on to the stage and greet your .
TATIANA: I believe her highness understands what she has to do.
ANYA: Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear.
TATIANA: No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
ANYA: There's no choice.
VLADIMIR: ( to Tatiana )
ANYA: Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
VLADIMIR: ( formally )
ANYA: Poor Meetoo!
VLADIMIR: ( formally )
ANYA: Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
TATIANA: But they didn't take the money - either one of them. I offered it to them, but they both refused.
ANYA: Dmitri didn't want the money?
TATIANA: No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
VLADIMIR: ( taking Sophie's hand ) ( backing away )
ANYA: Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
VLADIMIR: No. From now on I am your loyal subject . your highness. By your leave?
ANYA: Why does everyone have to act that way?
TATIANA: You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown.
ANYA: "If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
TATIANA: Is it? Is this what you want?
ANYA: I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
TATIANA: You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for And this is my future. This is who I am!
ANYA: And this is my future. This is who I am!
TATIANA: This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
ANYA: I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
TATIANA: Yes, you do. You do.
ANYA: I've spent my whole life waiting to find you .
TATIANA: And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
ANYA'S POV: the Princess Anastasia. But not Anya.
RASPUTIN: Look, Bartok. Most of them were there the night I made this curse. Now, they'll get to see it finished! Revenge is a dish best served. in front of a larrrrrge audience!
BARTOK: ( depressed )
ANYA: Dmitri is standing - like a zombie - at the far end of the platform. Anya sees him.
ANYA: Dmitri . Grandmama told me.
ANYA: Dmitri, what's wrong? Throw her off the edge! Do it!
RASPUTIN: ( from above )
ANYA'S POV: sees Rasputin.
ANYA: Dmitri . Look at me! It's Anya! It's ANYA!
ANYA: You saved my life in the palace! You won't take it now.
RASPUTIN: ( from above )
FINISH HER!: Anya holds her ground as Dmitri moves toward her, ready to push her off the As Dmitri come close, she moves toward him and kisses him. He blinks and snaps out of it and is quite happy that Anya is kissing him.
ANYA: Dmitri. I know you would never hurt me. You love me.
ANYA: Anya. where are we?
DMITRI: Anya. where are we?
ANYA: I guess you aren't as powerful as you thought!
RASPUTIN: I'll show you!
DMITRI: Run, Anya - go.
ANYA: I'm not leaving you!
RASPUTIN: Fighting for fair lady. How noble.
DMITRI: Dmitri throws himself against Rasputin several times only to get batted away like a fly. Realizing this is futile, Dmitri slips through the FLOOR GIRDERS and scurries towards the edge. BELOW TEM. DMITRI POV: Rasputin's large boots above him, heading for the edge.
ABOVE: Rasputin reaches the edge, playful dangling the struggling Anya over the side.
RASPUTIN: My curse is now complete! Good-bye, babushka!
ANYA'S POV: The city below as she FALLS. Dmitri emerges from the grid below and GRASS her, holding on to the back of her dress.
DMITRI: Take my hand!
ANYA: Don't let me go!
DMITRI: I'll never let go!
CLOSE: their hands, gripping one another.
RASPUTIN: This little piggy had a palace. this little piggy had a throne.
DIE!: The reliquary is dangling. Anya reaches up to grab on to it but her aim is off and she HITS it. The reliquary flies and SMASHES against the side of the tower, shattering. Rasputin realizes what has happened and scrambles away in terror.
NOOOOOOOOO!: ON BARTOK who covers his eyes.
ON BARTOK: who covers his eyes.
LONG SHOT: of the Eiffel Tower as the EVIL SPIRITS FROM THE RELIQUARY burst out. The SPIRITS take on all the forms we've seen earlier: BEARS, MINIONS, SNAKES, and combinations of all. They grow and swirl, with hideous MOANING noises. Anya and Dmitri huddle together, in disbelief.
ON RASPUTIN: as the SPIRITS begin to swarm around him, a TORNADO of horrid beings. Re screams as they pull him off the ON ANYA AND DMITRI as the force of the tornado increases, they have to hold on to the girders and each other in order not to be sucked in. Bartok is thrown against the side of the tower and slithers to the floor.
ON RASPUTIN: suspended over the Eiffel Tower in the maelstrom. He Screams wildly as the spirits encircle his, torment him and EXPLODE - pieces fly and disintegrate in mid-air, in wild colors and smoke.
ON BARTOK: who rises, patting his chest- He's about to let out a Bartokism. but all the emerges are LITTLE BAT SQUEAKS. He's surprised as first, then thrilled. The spell is broken and he's just a bat again.
DMITRI: Come on. I'll take you home.
ANYA: I am home.
BARTOK: Hanging from the rafters of the Eiffel Tower, no sure what to do next - then a cute female bat flies up next to his and "bats" her eyes.
