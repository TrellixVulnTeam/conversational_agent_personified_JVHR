YOUNG ADULT: Sifu Kwan, was that long enough? It's been 10 minutes.
KWAN: At Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan mountains, We monks trained in iron palm until our hands bled. . then we trained some more.
YOUNG ADULT: ( getting back into horse stance ) I guess not.
KWAN: Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger!
STUDENT: Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce Bruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is effective. Show me.
KWAN: Bruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is effective. Show me.
MOTHER: I only hope it brings him luck in the tournament.
KWAN: Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors depend on heart and soul ­ that's how they saved the T'ang emporer.
STUDENT 2: What do you want us to do?
KWAN: When the blind follow the blind, they both fall over the cliff. Understand?
STUDENT 2: The others mutter "No" and shake their heads, confused.
KWAN: No matter.
DREW: MASTER KWAN!
MASTER KWAN!: He hurries over to his master, a concerned look on his face. He leans down to help Kwan up, forgetting about the bowls of hot wax. It pours down on Kwan, scalding him, as well as running down Drew's chest. Kwan struggles to get up, while at the same time trying to wipe the hot wax off.
KWAN: ( blustering ) I'm OK, never mind! What are you doing anyway?
DREW: the already hard wax off his chest.
DREW: Practicing. I saw it in this movie. Why didn't you come to class? Why waste time with this. Should study tapes of opponent.
KWAN: Why didn't you come to class? Why waste time with this. Should study tapes of opponent.
DREW: I'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had tapes to study. they did it this way. right?
KWAN: Not quite ­ our drills at the temple had meaning. If we had tapes, we would have watched them.
DREW: The best?
KWAN: Best white boy, maybe. Just fight like a Shaolin warrior ­ the rest will take care of itself. Face reality, before it breaks your jaw!
BOB: ( shouting ) Are you screwing around with this stuff again?
DREW: Look, Bob, I'm not bothering you, am I?
BOB: It's your attitude that bothers me, son.
DREW: I'm not your son, Bob. Lay off.
BOB: ( cutting him off ) Don't say a word, yellow man.
DREW: ( sarcastic ) When I'm the best fighter in the country, I'm not going to let you be part of my entourage.
BOB: You mean when you're in jail.
DREW: Just leave me alone, Bob, OK? I NEVER asked for anything from you.
KWAN: Pressure. Big tournament this weekend.
BOB: How would you have liked having to take care of a kid you never really wanted. ?
KWAN: I wish I had the chance.
TREVOR: They said you were good. ha!
PFEELGUT: It's not enough just to win, Trevor. You have to destroy your opponent completely, mentally and physically. Beat him once, he's a threat. Humiliate him, and he'll fear you forever.
TREVOR: Ah, Master Kim. I'll look at these stats later.
KIM: ( thick accent ) You velly good fighter.
KIM: A mountain lion doesn't ponder his weakness, and is therefore vulnerable.
TREVOR: ( after a beat ) Well, I'm pretty damn tired of this fortune cookie crap. ( beat ) You're history. Chaunce, get ride of the bum.
CHAUNCY: Very good, sir.
TREVOR: Don't come here any more, you hear? Over a little more to the left, Sam.
COMPETITOR: Hey, Trevor! What's the 2nd uniform for?
TREVOR: The finals.
COMPETITOR: ( after he's gone ) Cocky bastard.
DREW AGAIN: ANGLE ON THE RING mosh of gear ( different colors, different makes ), while Trevor is decked out in designer, personalized gear.
ANNOUNCER: Fighting for the Grand Championship: Trevor Gottitall and Drew Carson. 3 rounds, max point. Gentlemen, bow to the ref, to each other.
ROUNDBREAK: Drew is exhausted, frustrated and worried. Trevor is pumped and ready to go on forever.
KWAN: You only lose if you give up.
TREVOR: I was never worried. He's no match for me. I just hope the 2nd place trophy is a belt!
KWAN: Next time we get that guy.
DREW: ( shaking his head ) No next time, Master. Maybe. ( big sigh ) . you should find a new student. I just can't do it ­ I'm not getting any better!
DREW: You mean. all the stories.?
KWAN: ( nodding ) Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin Temple. When I realized my dream couldn't come true, I convinced myself that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other Why are you telling me this?
DREW: Why are you telling me this?
KWAN: I've given you all I can, and it's not enough. It was never enough. You're like a son to me, Drew, and you have all the potential in the world, but I can't take you where you want to go.
DREW: So you're not a Shaolin?
KWAN: Never were?
DREW: Never were?
KWAN: Drew nods, an idea forming in his head. A slight smile forms on his face. Kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this.
DREW: If you are not a Shaolin warrior, then I will become one.
KWAN: What are you talking about?
DREW: I'm going to the Shaolin Temple ­ they can train me so I will never lose like that again. He hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold
KWAN: He hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold
DREW: ( eyes intent ) Don't you see? You said yourself I needed the right training ­ where better than the Shaolin Temple? What's holding me here? I have the chance to do what you couldn't. I will go to the Shaolin Temple.
KWAN: I must pay for your ticket.
DREW: No! I'll make it there myself.
KWAN: I grew up on the stories of the Shaolin, and you can be those stories. You can live my dream for me ­ at least let me help you. Let an old man make up for the trouble he's caused.
DREW: MONTAGE OF DEPARTURE ANGLE ON DREW AND KWAN AS KWAN HANDS HIM A "NORTHWEST AIRLINES" ANGLE ON DREW As he packs for China.
DREW: Where is the Shaolin Temple? Shaolin?
DREW: Hello, ladies! Can you tell me how to get to the Shaolin
ASHEMA: I do. But wouldn't it make more sense for you to speak Chinese than to expect us to speak English?
DREW: ( flustered ) You're right. I apologize ­ I've just been trying to get
ASHEMA: Why do you want to find the temple?
DREW: ( not without pride ) I am going to join the temple as a monk.
DREW: You have a car?
ASHEMA: The next best thing. This is a Chinese car.
ASHEMA: We are here.
DREW: Ashema climbs off the back and takes the bike from Drew, marveling at his awe-struck face.
ASHEMA: I have to help my grandfather with our stand. If you get a chance, come by later.
DREW: ( distracted ) I'll try, but monks aren't allowed to be around girls.
ASHEMA: Good luck.
DREW: Shaolin monks don't need luck. Hey, thanks a lot for the ride. I hope I see you again.
DREW: Excuse me, Master.
DREW: That was great! Great!
MONK 1: No tourists! Temple closed!
DREW: So you can see me?!?
MONK 1: ( very agitated ) No tourists! No tourists!
ADMISSIONS MONK: That's not possible.
DREW: What do you mean, sir?
ADMISSIONS MONK: The training is too difficult. Besides, Shaolin policy is no foreigners.
DREW: I didn't come all this way, from America, to get turned away. I want in. I want to become a Shaolin monk.
ADMISSIONS MONK: What people want and what they can have are often not the Not in this case.
DREW: Not in this case.
MONK: Oh, yes, especially in this case.
DREW: I'm not leaving.
MONK: You give me no choice. Remove him. I just want to be a monk!
DREW: I just want to be a monk!
DREW: Hey! What about my.
ASHEMA: Drew sits down heavily, putting his pack down next to him. Ashema places a cup of tea down in front of him, the steam rising from it.
DREW: Drew sits down heavily, putting his pack down next to him. Ashema places a cup of tea down in front of him, the steam rising from it.
ASHEMA: What happened?
DREW: They kicked me out.
ASHEMA: You've had enough.
DREW: I have to do this. I can't go home, not until I'm a monk. I'd be even more of a disgrace.
ASHEMA: Not now, Bau Bau.
DREW: Bau Bau?
ASHEMA: My nickname for him. He wants to tell you a story about the temple.
DREW: What did he do?
ASHEMA: He decided not to leave. He stayed in the courtyard until they let him in.
DREW: How long?
ASHEMA: A long time ­ through the worst weather. He just sat there, unmoving, through rain, sleet, snow.
DREW: Did they let him in?
ASHEMA: ( beat ) Of course they did ­ what kind of story do you think my
DREW: Please tell your grandfather, your Bau Bau, he is a wise man. And that he tells a good story.
ASHEMA: What are you going to do? Are you going home?
DREW: I'm camping out.
ADMISSIONS MONK: Go home! You cannot stay here!
DRILL SERGEANT: Will you give up? I think so.
ASHEMA: Give this up, Drew! Please?
SAN DE: My head is shiny enough already, don't you think?
DREW: You. You speak English? I'm sorry, I was just goofing. I apologize, master. I didn't mean to make fun of you.
SAN DE: What are you trying to do?
DREW: I want to become a monk ­ they won't let me in. Hey, you're just a grunt, a janitor sweeping up and all, don't sweat it. It's not your problem.
SAN DE: Why are you sitting here?
DREW: I got the idea from a story about a monk who wouldn't leave. I thought.
SAN DE: Has it been hard?
DREW: It was at first. I was uncomfortable, in pain, actually, but as time went on, I got. into it, I guess. The sacrifice made me feel. in control, you know what I Much of the training at the temple is in that direction ­ self sacrifice. Tell me more.
SAN DE: ( nodding ) Much of the training at the temple is in that direction ­ self sacrifice. Tell me more.
DREW: At first I was really bored, and very lonely. But then,
SAN DE: I wish you all the best.
DREW: Same to you.
ASHEMA: They are disciples. This is the last class for fighting monks at Shaolin.
MONK: Do you accept the authority of the Shaolin patriarchs?
DISCIPLE 1: Yes, without pause.
MONK: Do you renounce the earthly world?
DREW: Sure do, master. You bet.
MONK: Will you abide by the rules of the temple, even if it means death?
DREW: I do.
DRILL SERGEANT: ( whispering ) Answer "Yes, without pause."
DREW: ( rubbing his side ) Yes, without pause.
MONK: Who is the patriarch of the Shaolin Temple?
DISCIPLE 2: ANGLE ON DREW
MONK: Do you accept the shr fu at the Shaolin Temple as your spiritual leaders?
DREW: Yes, without pause.
MONK: Will a fighting monk ever use his skills for personal Yes, without pause.
DREW: Yes, without pause.
SAN DE: Do these disciples accept the authority of the Shaolin Yes, without pause, Master San De.
DRILL SERGEANT: Yes, without pause, Master San De.
DREW: ( under his breath ) I'll be damned!
GAO: Shut up!
DREW: ( holding his side ) Oh, unbelievable, in the same place.
SAN DE: Are they ready to begin their training?
DRILL SERGEANT: They are.
SAN DE: Then, let us welcome them into our ranks!
DREW: You got a problem, man?
GAO: You, American.
SAN DE: Your training begins tomorrow. For now, your shr fu will introduce you to our temple. Welcome to Shaolin.
DREW: Great, just great.
DREW: What are you doing, man?
MONK: You must surrender this.
DREW: No way, man! Get your own.
LI: Watch out for Gao. He's trouble.
DREW: Really? I hadn't noticed. Why'd they let him in, Who knows? Maybe for the challenge?
LI: Who knows? Maybe for the challenge?
DREW: No, that was me.
DREW: Mr. James designs my hair, master. I don't think.
DREW: What outside world? I don't want to be seen by anybody.
GAO: I want another bed.
LI: I will switch with Disciple Gao.
DREW: Li comes over to the new bed, and in silence they get climb into their respective beds. D.S. switches off the lights, then leaves, and Drew stares up at the ceiling.
LI: Where are you from?
DREW: New York City. You?
LI: Beijing. What is New York like?
DREW: Amazing. I'll tell you about.
GAO: Shut UP!
DREW: Blow me!
LI: Wan an.
DREW: You got to be kidding.
DREW: Wonder what they'll start us with first?
LI: Iron Palm?
SHU: Wooden Man, I think.
WU: No, it'll be basics, first day. Horse stance, kicks and
WU: Basics, I told you.
DREW: We're using the shovels as weapons?
DREW: Latrines? Why?
OR: "Working on a Chain Gang"
DREW: ( shocked ) What'd you do that for?
DREW: Don't tell me, I know. Get more water.
GAO: Back up and let me pass.
DREW: No chance, Gao. You back up.
LI: What happened?
WU: Did you see his face?
SHU: Poor guy.
GAO: He just wasn't good enough. I wouldn't be surprised if half of us go out the same way.
MEDITATION MONK: Breath in through your nose, out through your mouth. Imagine yourself sitting on the bank of a river watching your thoughts flow by. Clear your mind. Think of
DREW: Come out, goddamn it! Show yourself!
DREW: So what is this 'night soil' stuff anyway?
LI: Human waste.
DREW: Oh, man! You guys actually use this as fertilizer? That's
GAO: ( a little worried ) Let me pass.
DREW: This is ridiculous.
MEDITATION MONK: Bodhidharma meditated for 9 years without sleeping. Think you can manage 9 minutes?
DREW: We came here to train, not to be slaves! We're free But we swore to obey them.
MU: But we swore to obey them.
DREW: An uninformed choice is no choice at all!
MU: We have to stand up for our rights! If they don't even know we're dissatisfied, things will never change.
DREW: We have to stand up for our rights! If they don't even know we're dissatisfied, things will never change.
GAO: They haven't changed for centuries, why should we listen to you?
DREW: Are we men or mice? Sheep or the shepherd?
WU: I'm with you!
DREW: I'm for going to the Headmaster right now!
DREW: Master San De!
SAN DE: Who else?
DREW: We have something to say.
SAN DE: This is an interesting coincidence, as I was just on my way to your sleeping quarters to talk with you all.
DREW: I request permission to go first.
SAN DE: I think I'd better.
DREW: No, really, I want to.
SAN DE: Here at the temple, we use a period of intense physical labor to test your patience, and to teach you humility and self-reliance. As you continue training, you will be given chores every day ­ remember the first time you saw me I was sweeping? Physical labor keeps us humble.
DREW: I. I mean we, just wanted to. thank you for the opportunity to be part of the illustrious history of the Shaolin Temple. Yeah, that's it. Right, guys?
DREW: Gentlemen, this calls for a party!
GAO: You're trying to get us all kicked out!
DREW: I'm just trying to have a party. Chill out!
GAO: It's not over, American.
MONK: In order to keep our bodies strong, Bodhidharma gave us a series of exercises and breathing techniques. Because the times demanded action, we developed Shaolin style wu shu from these exercises.
DREW: What do you mean, 'Think not thinking'?
MONK: Non thinking.
DREW: I can't do this!
MONK: Block the way I showed you.
DREW: ( showing him a block ) This is the way I was taught.
GAO: ( menacingly ) My turn.
MONK: Emotions cloud the spirit ­ eliminate them.
DREW: This isn't martial arts ­ it's gymnastics!
MONK: This is Shaolin Wu Shu. Continue.
DREW: ( looking at ground ) Excuse me, Master, but there aren't any mats here.
DREW: Let's do it.
LI: Are you trying to kill yourself?
DREW: He hurts more than me, he's just not bleeding, that's
LI: If you go to San De, he can send you to a doctor.
DREW: I appreciate your concern, Li, but it's not that serious. I'm all right.
DREW: Thought I'd join you guys.
MONK: The goal of this drill is not to hurt your partner. Just try to tap his chest.
DREW: I know, but.
MONK: Then do it that way.
DREW: This sure beats sweeping.
DREW: ( imitating an announcer ) Presenting, the greatest fighter in the history of the Shaolin temple. Drew Carson! The crowd is going wild.
DREW: The crowd is going wild.
SAN DE: He was an amazing monk.
DREW: Yeah, what's up with him?
SAN DE: Come with me.
SAN DE: Legend states that Bodhidharma gave us tea. Once, while meditating, Bodhidharma fell asleep, a natural reaction we all have to fight against.
DREW: SAN DE Nothing is impossible if your spirit is pure, and your will is strong.
SAN DE: Nothing is impossible if your spirit is pure, and your will is strong.
DREW: It's just not the way I was taught.
SAN DE: Exactly! You are like this cup, full of what you have learned. How can we show you Shaolin unless you first empty your cup?
DREW: It's not fighting ­ I feel like I'm dancing or something. This soft stuff is unnatural ­ Fighting should be hard, tough.
DREW: ( after a beat )
LI: Drew! We're not supposed to.
DREW: Chill out, guys! It's our day off!
DREW: Check it out, guys!
WU: Good work, Wu. What tipped you off?
DREW: Good work, Wu. What tipped you off?
LI: ( alarmed ) We are not allowed to have contact with females. It is the most serious rule of the temple.
DREW: It's a stupid rule, Li. But.
ASHEMA!: ANGLE ON ASHEMA immediately recognize him. She looks around the park.
LI: You can get kicked out of the temple for this.
DREW: Who's going to tell, Li? You?
DREW: ( pointing at girls ) Not the giggle girls again! How've you been? You look ( hiding a laugh ) You look. funny.
ASHEMA: ( hiding a laugh ) You look. funny.
ASHEMA: How do you like the temple?
DREW: Shhh. nobody's supposed to know.
LI: We really shouldn't be doing this.
DREW: I'm trying to show you guys a good time. I guess I gotta go. It was great to see you.
ASHEMA: My school is having a party this Tuesday night. Can you and your friends come?
DREW: We'll be there.
LI: Are you nuts? We can't go to a party, with GIRLS!
DREW: Why not? We're working hard, we deserve some R & R.
LI: 'R & R'? We've earned this. Back home in New York, you don't say no to a party. Where's your sense of adventure?
DREW: We've earned this. Back home in New York, you don't say no to a party. Where's your sense of adventure?
WU: What do you do at a 'party' with girls?
DREW: You dance, and talk. And have a good time.
LI: That clinches it, we can't dance.
WU: And we don't know how to talk to girls.
DREW: ( trying to sound like an expert ) That's easy. You just talk to them like you would to the
GAO: Like you know?
DREW: Look, dancing's easy. I'll show you. We'll start with slow dancing.
LI: How do you know?
DREW: This is going to be great.
DREW: I thought this was light contact!
GAO: Fight, you coward!
DREW: You got it.
SAN DE: So soon? Tell me what happened.
DREW: It was my fault. I started it.
SAN DE: Is this true, Disciple Gao?
GAO: Yes. But, I am not completely blameless.
SAN DE: I didn't think you were. The Shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. We challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other. Never do we fight to see who is best ­ we train to be able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet express emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch or kick in anger. Shake hands and let your emotions go.
DREW: The best fighter?
SAN DE: Among other things. Fighting is only a small part of being a Shaolin monk.
GAO: San De nods.
SAN DE: Return to your training.
DREW: Ten more seconds and I would have kicked your ass.
GAO: In your dreams.
DREW: Now, we're ready!
GAO: I'm coming, just to keep you out of trouble!
GAO: ( whisper ) Drunken Kung Fu.
DREW: Are we men or are we sheep?
GROUP: And they follow Drew, the shepherd, in through the front door, making noises like sheep.
SHEEP!: And they follow Drew, the shepherd, in through the front door, making noises like sheep.
DREW: Great party.
DREW: ( eyes still closed ) Not now, Li.
TOUGH: ANGLE ON DISCIPLES. ANGLE ON DREW He turns back to Ashema, but she is pulled back by the giggle girls, away from danger. The tough spins Drew around and pushes him HARD. One of the toughs has already gotten behind him, on his knees, and Drew goes flipping over the tough, landing hard on the ground, the wind knocked out of Drew gets up, wincing, not really ready to fight.
DREW: No, thanks.
DREW: Did you say you were going to keep us OUT of trouble?
GAO: I can't believe nobody's said anything! It's been a whole We broke every major rule the temple has, how could we get away with it?
LI: We broke every major rule the temple has, how could we get away with it?
DREW: I think we might have. If they knew, they'd have already gotten us! You guys just have to stop looking so guilty.
WU: I've lost my appetite.
DREW: Let's go back to the dorm for a few minutes, go over our stories in case they seperate us.
LI: Seperate us?
DREW: Cops! Somebody called the cops?!?
HEADMISTRESS: He's the one!
SAN DE: Drew, I think you know Headmistress Low. Correct?
POLICE LIEUTENANT: We demand that he leaves the temple, and China!
POLICE CAPTAIN: He's a disgrace, to the temple and to this country. He must leave.
SAN DE: This is a serious issue, there is no question. This we will have to take under advisement ­ but we will handle matters of this temple.
POLICE CAPTAIN: This involves more than just the temple. I am authorized to escort him from your temple to the jail now, tonight, where he will be held until he leaves the country.
HEADMISTRESS: He does not belong here!
DREW: ( whisper ) Chill out, honey!
SAN DE: Thank you all for coming. I am pleased that you brought this problem to our attention. May you sleep well tonight
POLICE CAPTAIN: I do not wish to visit you again with this kind of news.
SAN DE: You will not have to.
DREW: Master, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I appreciate you both going to bat like that for me. I won't let it happen Neither will we. You must leave the temple in the But I thought. the police.
SAN DE: Neither will we. You must leave the temple in the But I thought. the police.
DREW: But I thought. the police.
SAN DE: As am I.
GAO: Why only you?
LI: The D.S. always told us that we're all responsible for what happens.
WU: It's not fair.
DREW: It doesn't have to be fair.
DREW: I hate long goodbyes anyway.
GAO: You're either with us or against us, remember?
DREW: ( smiling ) I'm with you!
SAN DE: Quite a show of solidarity, yes? Why did you come to the Shaolin Temple?
DREW: ( caught off guard ) To train, Master.
DREW: Within myself?
SAN DE: You must accept the responsibility for your life. If we force you out of the temple, you can always blame the
DREW: What if I can't handle it? What if I fail?
SAN DE: Live for the moment, Drew. The future will take care of itself. If you go through your days here, squeezing every last bit of life out of every minute, you need not fear Then, it's up to me.
DREW: ( after a beat ) Then, it's up to me.
DREW: I don't want to let them down.
SAN DE: Don't let yourself down.
GAO: Are you staying?
DREW: Yeah, I'm staying. If only to keep you guys out of
LI: Drew! Are you allright?
DREW: Yeah, I'm just a little on edge, that's all. Ever since I got to the temple, some nut has been attacking me with a stick ­ at night, in the toilet. anywhere! It's driving me crazy.
GAO: Every class of disciples, the one with the most potential is singled out for special training. We were wondering who it was. now, we know.
DREW: Special training? You mean.?
DREW: Ashema, beautiful Ashema, I can't see you anymore. I will. miss you and remember you. always.
ASHEMA: Are they making you do this?
DREW: No. It is my choice, and my responsibility. I'm sorry.
GAO: What if I hurt him?
DREW: With pleasure.
DREW: Allright! I did it!
DREW: ( bowing ) Boy, his spirit is strong.
SAN DE: Go long.
GAO: I can't believe you carried that girl over the stream! After all the trouble you got into.
LI: Are you crazy? You almost got kicked out once over that kind of thing.
DREW: I left that girl at the stream. Are you two still carrying her?
DREW: Lucky shot, slant eye!
GAO: You stink, American!
DREW: That's it! You're dead meat!
GAO: I had you.
DREW: I wonder what you did now.
SAN DE: You are to deliver this scroll to the Arhat living on the
DREW: I will, Master.
SAN DE: If you deliver this, you may ask this master, the most advanced monk of the Shaolin tradition, any question you wish, and he must answer it.
DREW: OK, boys, just let me get my glass and.
DREW: No, don't do that!
WOMAN: Why not?
DREW: I'm a monk. I've taken a vow to abstain.
WOMAN: No one will know.
DREW: I'll know! Throw me my clothes, please.
TOURIST 1: Not another temple!
TOURIST 2: Do they have a gift shop?
TOURIST 3: Guide! How do you say 'gift shop'?
GUIDE: You have 10 minutes to be back on the bus.
TOURIST 1: A real live monk! Somebody, take my picture!
DREW: Oh Mi Two Fwo
DREW: I'll say.
DREW: Just like at the temple.
DREW: Is this rope strong enough for both of us? OK, OK, I'm going!
DREW: What the heck.
DREW: What am I going to tell the arhat?
DREW: Maybe he won't miss one little scroll.
DREW: Master! I apologize, I did not see you.
ARHAT: What is life? What is reality? The head of a dead cat.
DREW: ( smiling ruefully )
ARHAT: For forty years, Shaolin disciples have made their quest to deliver a scroll to me. You are not Chinese.
DREW: No. American.
ARHAT: I notice the littlest details.
DREW: How many succeeded?
ARHAT: A handful. You chose correctly. Nothing is more precious than human life.
DREW: But, I didn't obey.
ARHAT: ( smiling slightly ) At the beginning of your training, you were to obey without question. Now, as you become a Shaolin, you must learn to question everything, and obey yourself.
DREW: I have to leave. What is the easiest way to get back to the temple.
ARHAT: The bus.
DREW: Thank you, Master.
ARHAT: They should give you a bus schedule with that map.
DREW: We've got to rebuild this?
SAN DE: Only one trial remains before you become full fledged fighting monks. The Wooden Man Chamber.
DREW: Master San De, I am part of the disciple class, am I not?
SAN DE: ( very proud ) Your request is granted.
DREW: ( whispering ) I can't do it.
SAN DE: You are now Shaolin. We welcome you into our ranks as fighting monks.
SAN DE: I wouldn't have made it through without you. You once asked why I came here, why did you let me in?
DREW: I wouldn't have made it through without you. You once asked why I came here, why did you let me in?
SAN DE: Do you remember the story you heard about the monk who would not leave?
DREW: SAN DE That monk was me.
SAN DE: That monk was me.
DREW: SAN DE Before you leave for American, can you help at an international tournament in Beijing? The Shaolin temple has an entry, and he will be fighting men from all over the world ­ I'd like you to be there.
SAN DE: Before you leave for American, can you help at an international tournament in Beijing? The Shaolin temple has an entry, and he will be fighting men from all over the world ­ I'd like you to be there.
DREW: No problem. Without pause.
SAN DE: Now, a friend would like to see you. . alone.
DREW: Are we late?
SAN DE: The fight has not yet started.
DREW: Did you think he would get into the finals?
SAN DE: Who could know? He fights the winner of the Western countries, which is why I wanted you here.
DREW: I'll help any way I can.
TREVOR: Carson! Drew Carson! I can't believe it! I come half way around the world, and run into you! I heard you left the city, but I didn't know losing to me drove you into being a monk!
DREW: I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never happen again.
TREVOR: So, let's see what you've learned.
DREW: ( shaking his head ) I've learned that. there's nothing to prove. Beating you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be defeated, not you.
DREW: The arts should never be about who is best ­ they are too important for that.
TREVOR: COME BACK HERE! You can't just walk away!
SAN DE: Do you turn away from him out of fear?
TREVOR: I thought the Shaolin monks were warriors, not babies! Look at him ­ he is too scared to face me!
DREW: No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for my ego.
SAN DE: You have learned much.
TREVOR: The Shaolin monks are PUSSIES! Warrior-monks? Ha!
SAN DE: You did the right thing.
TREVOR: How about you, baldy? Or you?
GAO: Master, the American is insulting the Temple, and the fighting monks.
SAN DE: ( looking at drew ) What should be done?
SAN DE: There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.
DREW: For the temple.
TREVOR: Remember last time, punk?
DREW: Nothing exists but the moment, and. . I'm going to enjoy it.
TREVOR: Stay still, dammit! Stand and fight!
