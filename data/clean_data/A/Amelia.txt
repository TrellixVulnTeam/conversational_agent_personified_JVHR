FRED: I mean, why would a guy who needs to run the show. Pick the one girl he knew could kick his tail?

AMELIA: I do.
GEORGE: In the 12 months since Lindbergh, 55 people in 18 planes have tried. Three planes made it. Fourteen people have died.
AMELIA: I'll make it.
GEORGE: Three women died trying. Two others escaped with their lives. If you do make it, you'd be the first. Which.is the real attraction for both of us, I
AMELIA: Always nice to know what the real attraction is.
GEORGE: The plane was bought from Adm. Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite who wanted the record for herself. Her family wouldn't tolerate the danger. She has asked for a
AMELIA: Why would that matter?
GEORGE: Because she wants the world to pay attention. And pretty girls command more attention.
AMELIA: Was that your advice?
GEORGE: Sure. My role is selling this event to the public. There will be a contract for the girl's story with the New York Times. Also a book to be published over her name.
AMELIA: Except for the part that goes to Which will be as great as I can manage, I assure you.
GEORGE: Which will be as great as I can manage, I assure you.
AMELIA: You said she wants a flyer.
GEORGE: Don't get your hopes up. The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be the pilot. There'll be a male co- pilot and navigator. The woman will be purely a passenger.
AMELIA: Why would anyone want a book from a Because the hook is that we're making the woman the commander. The pilot will sign a contract saying he is under her direction and control. It's her ship, her Good for my chances, you said. What are my chan.

AMELIA: Specially if I don't make it.
SAM: Don't joke about that.
AMELIA: Well, I'll have impressive credentials as a long-distance passenger. That's not exactly a career in aviation.
SAM: And where does that leave us?
AMELIA: You do love to look on the dark side. Whatever did you see in a sunny character like me? It's not as if I'd been putting pressure on you.
SAM: It's not as if I'd been putting pressure on you.
AMELIA: What love means to you. What it requires. Is the pressure.
SAM: I love you. Is that such a terrible problem?
AMELIA: The problem is what it's always been. The problem is me.
MABEL: Okay, boys. I'll take any questions you wanna throw my way. Except about what's behind this

GEORGE: The Admiral estimates the pontoons only cut our range by 200 miles.
BILL: The Admiral is the Admiral. He gets to estimate any damn thing he wants. All we have to do is figure out how to fly without petrol.
AMELIA: I wonder if it can keep them up there. Not that I've ever had enough to try.
AMELIA: Sorry. I'll try keeping my mouth What I ought to try. Is listening to you once in awhile.
GEORGE: What I ought to try. Is listening to you once in awhile.

MABEL: Well, how would any woman feel about some tart who steals her man?

EPORTER: Mabel, are you implying Miss Earhart used her feminine charms on your pilot?

AMELIA: I was a passenger on this journey. Just a passenger. Everything that was done to bring us across was done by Wilmer Stultz and Slim Gordon. All the praise.
REPORTER: ( calls out ) But you can fly, can't you?
AMELIA: This flight was solely to the credit of Bill and Slim. Women should know, however, that I have had 500 hours solo flying and once held the women's altitude record.
REPORTER: So you could have done it yourself!
AMELIA: This particular flight, under these conditions, I wonder if anyone but Bill Stultz could have pulled it off. But certainly, one day a woman will do this. As easily, as skillfully, as professionally as any man.

S: he likes this question. Fixes the man with that clear, honest gaze.
AMELIA: Well, being a social worker by trade and passion, I'll be going back to work at Denison House when all this fun is over.

GEORGE: The truth is, she was a celebrity on smaller stages all her life.
A: NGLE. Amelia writing, looking up to see George coming down the back porch steps to the garden.
GEORGE: Lucky Strike endorsement. I wrote the copy myself.
AMELIA: What does it say? `I don't smoke but you should?'
GEORGE: It says Lucky Strikes were the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship. That's true.
AMELIA: True and misleading. Why would I sign that?
GEORGE: So Bill and Slim get paid.

AMELIA: Relax, George. I meant a Coke.
L: ATER. Tea in the sitting room. Elinor leaning forward, guileless, eager.
ELINOR: They're saying you get $500 a week on the lecture circuit.
AMELIA: All depends. On whether you want the sell or the real.
ELINOR: Oh, I don't underestimate the value of selling. It's why I'm here.
GEORGE: A 16-year-old girl sets an altitude record, then makes headlines illegally flying under the four bridges of the East River. You don't seem to need much help selling yourself.
ELINOR: Well, actually Mr. Putnam, I was hoping you could do to me what you've done to her. What I mean is. It's a good thing. That's why I want it.
GEORGE: Just so we're clear, young lady. What is your primary ambition? To take Amelia's place as the number one female pilot. Well, good for you! I would have expected nothing less. You want a tip?

GEORGE: Well, in that case, for your information, it is a lovely party indeed. Anything on your mind?
DOROTHY: It's not so much that my husband is having an affair with his meal ticket. It's just a pity we can't have one honest conversation about What's wrong with this one? A promising start, I'd say, in the honesty department.
GEORGE: What's wrong with this one? A promising start, I'd say, in the honesty department.
OROTHY: If this is what you call an honest talk, I'd say you need some Great. Let's try one about you and Fred Upton.

ELINOR: Get in line behind the boys she smacked around on the Derby.
GEORGE: And both of those things. Are the trange words. He has her attention.
ELINOR: I'm not sure she has much of a chance, Mr. Putnam.
GEORGE: Well, the one shot would be putting her in a far more powerful plane than anything she's flown. We're thinking the Lockheed Vega.
ELINOR: Sir, I've test piloted the Vega. It's way more than she could ever handle. It wouldn't be safe, let alone successful.
GEORGE: That's why I'm thinking of you flying with her. You could handle the cross-country flying, the more difficult bits, and I'd pay you $75 a week.
ELINOR: Well, I think that's the most generous opportunity I've ever been offered.
GEORGE: There's just one thing. Obviously, it has to appear that Amelia did all the flying. So when pictures are taken, you'll stand off to one
ELINOR: In that case, I'll get my own plane and win the race myself.
GEORGE: You haven't changed.
N: o smile at all.
ELINOR: That's a threat.
GEORGE: I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor. And this is what my loyalty requires.
