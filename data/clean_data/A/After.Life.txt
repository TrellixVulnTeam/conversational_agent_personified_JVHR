AFTER.LIFE: Written by
BLINDING WHITENESS: We hear a MAN GASPING softly. Rhythmically. A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing whiteness. Gradually we realize we're moving across the ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent.
PAUL: What's wrong?
ANNA: Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor.
PAUL: ( SIGHS WEARILY )
PAUL: .it's like fucking a corpse.
PAUL: Shit. I'm sorry. That was
PAUL: Anna. I'm sorry. That was a stupid thing to say. But you know sometimes. sometimes it's like you're not here anymore. Like you're somewhere else.
PAUL: Is this about us?
ON ANNA: her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her.
ANNA: It's not about us.
ANNA: I don't know.
ANNA: I'm happy.
ON ANNA: her nose is bleeding. She touches her lips. Looks impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF WATER carries into the next scene.
ELIOT: The Antique Carlisle. Solid cherry. Hand rubbed satin finish. Tufted sovereign interior. Eternal-Rest adjustable mattress with matching pillow.
ELIOT: Or perhaps the Aegean? Solid bronze exterior. Hand brushed finish with Grecian bronze highlights.
MRS. AYRES: The Antique Carlisle. Definitely the Antique Carlisle.
ELIOT: ( writes in his notebook ) Excellent choice.
MRS. AYRES: An antique coffin for an antique lady. We suit each other.
ELIOT: ( SMILES )
ELIOT: Mrs. Ayres?
MRS. AYRES: I'm sorry. Yes. A private visitation.
ELIOT: It's different every time. Each person dies in their own way.
TALL KID: Hey. Jack-off!
ACNE KID: He must be deaf.
TALL KID: You deaf Jack-off?
TALL KID: Can't fucking speak either.
ANNA: What's going on?
ANNA: Nothing Miss Bryant.

JACK: I think it's dead.
ANNA: No. The poor thing's just scared.

PAUL: Great. Broccoli. Who the fuck ordered broccoli?
NEAL: Oh that's just disgusting.
PREPPY GUY: What's wrong with vegetarian pizza? It's Pizza isn't supposed to be healthy.

PAUL: And Anna. Everything's going to be fine.
PAUL: I promise.
ANNA: ( NERVOUSLY )
ANNA: Is someone there?
ANNA: Did I scare you Miss Bryant?
JACK: Did I scare you Miss Bryant?
ANNA: It's locked.
ANNA: Shouldn't you be home?
JACK: My mom's picking me up.
ANNA: ( tries to keep a straight-face ) I didn't know the park was open yet.
JACK: My mom's friends with the manager. They're opening it specially for me.
ANNA: Sounds like fun.
JACK: Yes. It will be fun.
ANNA: Jack. Those boys. Do they bother you a lot?
ANNA: You know you can always talk to me about it if you want to.
ANNA: You sure you don't need a ride?
ANNA: Well. I better run.
JACK: Where are you going?
ANNA: ( HESITATES )
JACK: ( with sudden interest ) Can I come?
ANNA: No Jack. Funerals are very private I've never been to a funeral.
JACK: I've never been to a funeral.
ANNA: It wouldn't be appropriate Jack. Anyway wouldn't your mom worry about you?
JACK: ( SHRUGS )
ANNA: I'm sure she would. I'll see you tomorrow in class. Have a wonderful
ON SINK: Startling white. A stream of water flows into the sink. Then after a moment the spiralling clear water gradually turns a deep crimson red.
ANNA: Yes Mother.
BEATRICE: Terrible color.
ANNA: Can I get you something to eat?
BEATRICE: I'm not hungry.
ANNA: You have to eat.
BEATRICE: I don't have to do anything.
ANNA: The doctor said
BEATRICE: The doctor's an idiot. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
BEATRICE: Why did you do it? Today of all days.
ANNA: What have I done wrong this time?
BEATRICE: You've forgotten haven't you?
ANNA: No I haven't forgotten. The service isn't till six.
BEATRICE: Then you've got plenty of time to wash it It's permanent. You can't wash it out.
ANNA: It's permanent. You can't wash it out.
BEATRICE: Then dye it back. You can't show up at the funeral looking like that. Like some I don't look
ANNA: I don't look
BEATRICE: Don't argue with me. Why are you constantly arguing with me?
BEATRICE: Where are you going?
ANNA: To do the washing up.
BEATRICE: The sheets need changing. They haven't been changed in months.
ANNA: I changed them Monday.
BEATRICE: You weren't here Monday. You never sleep at home anymore. What if something happened to me in the middle of the night?
ANNA: Nothing is going to happen to you.
ANYWAY DIANE: ( SNORTS )
BEATRICE: ( SNORTS )
ANNA: That's enough Mother!
BEATRICE: That's it. Go and cry to Paul.
BEATRICE: Go and bitch to Paul about your mean old
FATHER GRAHAM: We have entrusted our brother James Hutton to God's mercy in sure and.
MRS. HUTTON: White roses. They were his favorite. How did you know?
ELIOT: They just seemed appropriate somehow.
MRS. HUTTON: He looks so peaceful. As if he's only
ANNA: Mrs. Hutton. I'm so sorry.
MRS. HUTTON: Thank you Anna. You were always his favorite student.
MRS. HUTTON: How's your mother?
ANNA: Fine. She sends her condolences.
MRS. HUTTON: You look tired dear.
ANNA: No. I'm fine. Everything's fine.
ANNA'S POV: James Hutton lies peacefully amongst the velvet trimming. Suddenly his LIPS PART. as he GASPS SOFTLY.
VIEWING ROOM: Anna steps back terrified. Stares at Hutton. His face serene again. It must have been her imagination. She glances up quickly. Embarrassed. Eliot's still observing her. He nods to her cordially.
ELIOT'S POV: Anna's by her car rummaging in a bag for her keys. Getting increasingly frustrated.
PAUL: You scared the life out of me.
PAUL: Your hair.
ANNA: You don't like it.
PAUL: I didn't say that. It's just very. red. I mean it's not really you is it?
WAITER: Are you ready to order?
PAUL: Yes. We'll have the duck.
ANNA: What? You always have the duck here.
PAUL: What? You always have the duck here.
ANNA: ( picks up the menu ) I don't always have the duck.
ANNA: I'll have the duck.
PAUL: The duck is very good.
PAUL: Let's not argue tonight. OK?
ANNA: Anna takes a sip of wine.
ANNA: This is good.
ANNA: And looks very expensive.
PAUL: ( suddenly very serious ) Actually there is something I need to talk to you about.
PAUL: I've been offered a transfer to head office in Chicago.
PAUL: It'll mean more work of course. More responsibility. A lot of changes. But it's an incredible opportunity. I'd be crazy to turn it down. And.
ANNA: ( without looking up ) You're going to leave me.
ANNA: You could've just told me this morning. You didn't need to buy me off with an expensive meal.
PAUL: Anna wait.
ANNA: Why did you lie to me? You promised everything was going to be OK.
PAUL: ( INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED )
ANNA: I'm not being ridiculous. Why do you always talk to me like I'm a small child?
PAUL: ( as if talking to a small child ) See? There you go again. Do you know how irritating that is?
ANNA: See? There you go again. Do you know how irritating that is?
PAUL: ( LOSES IT )
ANNA: Fuck you!
PAUL: Keep your voice down, everyone's watching.
ANNA: FUCK YOU! You're crazy. You know that? Just like your mother.
FUCK YOU!: You're crazy. You know that? Just like your mother.
PAUL: You're crazy. You know that? Just like your mother.
ANNA: I'm nothing like my mother!
PAUL: ( STANDS )
ANNA: Paul's suddenly aware that everyone's looking at him. He quickly sits down. Drains his glass of wine. Furious.
PAUL: Anna. Open the door. Please. I want you to come with me. I want to.
ANNA'S CAR: She hesitates. For a moment we think she might go back to him.
ANNA: Anna swerves into the next lane. We hear the blaring horn from the car behind her.
ANNA: ( into rear-view mirror ) OK. OK. I saw you.
ANNA: Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up? I just don't want it to end like this.
ANNA: Where am I?
ELIOT: You're in a funeral home.
ELIOT: You had a car accident. It was raining. You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes.
ANNA: I'm not dead.
ELIOT: You were pronounced dead eight hours ago. Your blood no longer circulates through your body. Your brain cells are slowly dying. Your body's already decomposing.
ANNA: I'm not dead.
ON DOCUMENT: It's Anna's death certificate.
PREP ROOM: You were dead on arrival. The attending physician signed here. .at 9.45 last night. I picked up your body from the hospital morgue at 12.10 this morning. I'm sorry.
ELIOT: You were dead on arrival. The attending physician signed here. .at 9.45 last night. I picked up your body from the hospital morgue at 12.10 this morning. I'm sorry.
ELIOT: I'm sorry.
ANNA: Who are you?
ANNA: Don't touch me! Why are you touching me?
ELIOT: I'm preparing your body. You have to look beautiful for your funeral.
ANNA: I'm not dead.
ELIOT: You all say the same thing.
ON ANNA: The lights go off. O.S. the door clicks shut as it locks automatically behind Eliot.
ANNA: ( SOFTLY )
ANNA: Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up? I just don't want it to end like this.
ASSISTANT: It's the schoolteacher's. From the car crash. Should I answer it?
ASSISTANT: Someone's in for a surprise.
OLD GUY: How many times do I have to tell you? You can't leave their stuff laying around. It should've been returned to the family.
ASSISTANT: I've been busy, OK.
ASSISTANT: What shall I do with this?
OLD GUY: Where's the other one?
OLD GUY: Just burn it. You can't send them back one shoe. It's not respectful.
PAUL: ( ON PHONE )
PAUL: Still no answer. Paul looks around. Notices the driveway's empty. He heads back to his car.
PAUL: ( INTO PHONE )
TEACHER: . the shell grows slowly.
PAUL: Oh hi. I'm looking for Anna Bryant.
TEACHER: ( INDIGNANT )
PAUL: I'm Anna's. fianc√©e. Paul Conran. I thought this was her class.
PAUL: We had a little misunderstanding last She didn't come in today.
TEACHER: ( HESITATES )
PAUL: Did she call in sick?
TEACHER: She hasn't called in at all. It's not like her. She always calls in.
ANNA: Please don't hurt me.
ELIOT: ( SMILES )
ANNA: But I'm not dead.
ELIOT: Then why are you here?
ANNA: Please. Just let me go. I won't go to the police. I won't tell anyone.
ELIOT: You're still in denial. You have to trust me. I'm only here to help you.
ELIOT: Don't be scared.
ANNA: What are you doing?
ELIOT: This will relax your muscles. Stop the rigor mortis setting in so I can work on your body.
ELIOT: ( TO HIMSELF )
ELIOT: I'm so very sorry Mrs. Bryant. It's always so tragic when you lose a child.
BEATRICE: I lost her years ago.
ELIOT: If you'd care to come to my office we can discuss the arrangements.
BEATRICE: I want to see her.
ELIOT: But she hasn't been
BEATRICE: I don't care. I want to see her.
ELIOT: Of course.
ELIOT: Ah. Forgive me.
ELIOT: As I said. I've only just started preparing her.
BEATRICE: What's the point of preserving the body if the soul's already left?
ELIOT: ( quietly to himself ) No. The soul never leaves.
BEATRICE: It's us who are left behind. It's us who Who's going to look after me now? Did you think about that?
ELIOT: I'll confirm the date with Father Graham this afternoon. Friday as you requested.
BEATRICE: Just do what you think's best. It's just
BEATRICE: Oh there is one thing.
ELIOT: Her hair. She was a brunette. I'd like it back to that color.
BEATRICE: Her hair. She was a brunette. I'd like it back to that color.
PAUL'S POV: Beatrice's car pulls up. Diane gets out. Pulls the wheelchair out of the car.
PAUL'S CAR: Paul grabs the flowers.
PAUL: Mrs. Bryant.
PAUL: Hi Diane. I need to talk to Anna.
PAUL: What's wrong?
DIANE: I think you better come in.
PAUL: What happened? Where's Anna?
BEATRICE: ( WITHOUT TURNING )
PAUL: A car crash? When?
BEATRICE: ( IRRITABLY )
DIANE: They said it happened just before 8.30.
PAUL: But. we were at the restaurant.
BEATRICE: You shouldn't have let her drive in that
PAUL: No. She can't be dead. There must be some mistake.
BEATRICE: There's no mistake. We just got back from the funeral home.
BEATRICE: ( DRYLY )
PAUL: Why didn't you call me?
BEATRICE: You took her away from me. I don't want you anywhere near her.
ANNA: I must be in shock. That's all. It's just shock.
ANNA: ( HOARSE )
ELIOT'S POV: Paul stands in the middle of the driveway staring blankly at the Funeral Home.
ELIOT: Can I help you?
PAUL: Mr. Deane?
ELIOT: My name's Conran. Paul Conran.
PAUL: My name's Conran. Paul Conran.
ELIOT: Of course. The lawyer. It's a small town. In my line of work you get to know everyone eventually.
PAUL: I'm Anna Bryant's fianc√©e.
ELIOT: That's strange. She wasn't wearing an engagement ring.
PAUL: Well not quite fianc√©e.
ELIOT: I'm very sorry for your loss Mr. Conran.
PAUL: I'd like to see her.
ELIOT: I'm afraid the viewing isn't until
PAUL: I'd need to see her now. If that's I'm sorry. It's not possible. You're not family and
ELIOT: I'm sorry. It's not possible. You're not family and
PAUL: Please. It'd only take a minute.
ELIOT: I understand. But
PAUL: NO. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
ANNA: ( WEAKLY )
PAUL: I tried to stop her. She didn't hear me.
ELIOT: Mr. Conran. There really is nothing I can do. I'm so sorry.
ANNA: Who was that?
ELIOT: No one.
ANNA: No one?
ELIOT: It was Paul.
ANNA: ( CALMLY )
ELIOT: Did you love him?
ANNA: That's none of your business.
ANNA: You weren't going to tell me Paul was here, were you?
ELIOT: Why not?
ANNA: Why not?
ELIOT: Because it would only hurt you. You have to let go of the living. Just like they have to let go of you.
ANNA: I don't believe you. Why are you doing this to me?
ELIOT: You're all the same. You all blame me for your death. As if it were my fault.
ANNA: No. You drugged me. So my mother
WOULDN'T: The others. They just see you as a dead body on a slab. Only I can see you as you really are.
ELIOT: The others. They just see you as a dead body on a slab. Only I can see you as you really are.
ANNA: You're crazy!
ELIOT: I'm a busy man. I don't have time for this.
ELIOT: Oh I nearly forgot. How tall are you?
ANNA: He looks her up and down. Gauging her height.
ELIOT: Five seven.
ANNA: I need to know how tall you are. For your coffin.
ELIOT: I need to know how tall you are. For your coffin.
ANNA: He ignores her. The door CLICKS shut behind him.
ANNA: Oh God. Please. I don't want to die.
ON NEWSPAPER: Schoolteacher Dies in Tragic Car Crash.
JACK: You were supposed to pick me up from school yesterday.
JACK: I waited.
POLICE OFFICER: ( INTO PHONE )
PAUL: Is Tom in?
POLICE OFFICER: The captain just stepped out. He won't be long. You can wait in his office if you want.
PAUL: Thanks. I'll just go and grab a coffee.
POLICE OFFICER: ( INTO PHONE )
PAUL: Come on.
PAUL: You piece of shit.
ANNA'S CAR: Glass everywhere. Paul glances at the KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD DOLL on the dashboard flecked with blood. He places his hands on the steering wheel. Suddenly he hears a strange noise. He looks up. The KITSCHY DOLL. Its head NODDING SLOWLY. Its smiling face now unnaturally sinister. Turning towards us until it abruptly stops. Staring straight at us. Paul looks at the doll transfixed. Just then a PALE WOMAN'S HAND slowly reaches through the window. and touches Paul's shoulder. He jumps. Turns. ANNA stands by the car. Staring blankly at him. The color drains from Paul's face.
GARAGE: Paul gets out awkwardly. He can't look Tom in the eye.
TOM: You OK?
PAUL: ( UNCONVINCING )
TOM: I just found out. I'm so sorry Paul. If you need anything
PAUL: I need to see Anna.
TOM: ( PUZZLED )
PAUL: The funeral director won't let me see her Tom. He says I'm not family. Can you talk to him? Put some pressure on him.
TOM: I can't do that.
PAUL: Tom. You're my friend.
TOM: Paul. I can't do it.
TOM: You sure you're OK?
PAUL: I fucked up.
TOM: Paul. It was an accident. You should get some rest. Let me drive you home.
PAUL: I always fuck everything up.
PREP ROOM: Eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of hair dye with photographs of smiling women. As he prepares the dye he looks across at Anna. She's staring at something behind him. Eliot turns. Sees the uncovered body of the Old Woman on the gurney. He quickly walks over. Carefully pulls the white sheet over the Old Woman.
ANNA: Who is she?
ELIOT: Mrs. Whitehall.
ELIOT: You shouldn't be afraid of her. The dead can't harm the dead.
ANNA: ( FORCEFULLY )
ANNA: Stay where you are.
ELIOT: ( holds out his hand ) Give me the scissors. I only want to help you.
ANNA: Don't come any closer. I swear to God I'll kill you.
ELIOT: ( CALMLY )
ELIOT: Go on.
PREP ROOM: For a moment we think she might do it. But then she wavers.
ELIOT: What are you waiting for?
ANNA: I'm breathing! Look. I'm still alive!
ELIOT: You think you're still alive because you're still attached to life. It's normal. You're just imagining you still have symptoms of life.
ANNA: Maybe I was in some kind of coma. The doctors made a mistake. They're always making mistakes.
ELIOT: You died. Everyone dies.
ANNA: How can I be dead if we're talking?
ELIOT: We're talking not because you're alive. But because I have a gift.
ANNA: To help them make the transition.
ELIOT: To help them make the transition.
ANNA: Is this what happens when you die?
ELIOT: It depends on how you lived your life.
ANNA: What do you mean?
ELIOT: Not everyone needs my help. Some let go as soon as their body dies. Others don't let go until long after they're in the grave.
ANNA: Am I a ghost? Is that why I'm here?
ELIOT: You're here so I can bury you.
ELIOT: Come. We've wasted enough time already.
ANNA: ( WHISPERS )
ELIOT: You're a corpse. Your opinion doesn't count anymore.
ANNA: But I can breathe. I must be alive.
ELIOT: You people. You all think that if you breathe, shit, piss you're alive.
ELIOT: You clutch onto life as if your life was worth clutching onto. Was your life worth clutching onto Anna?
ELIOT: Was it? Maybe you died a long time ago.
ELIOT: I have to tell you I'm surprised you're still arguing with me. You don't have much time left. Look. She's accepted her death. Her life has been examined. She has no more regrets. And now she's at peace. She used her time well. You still have so much to learn.
ANNA: I have nothing to learn!
ELIOT: Are you sure?
ELIOT: Your funeral's in three days. Soon you'll be enclosed in a coffin. Then buried in the ground. No-one will hear you then. No-one will talk to you there.
ANNA: Are you cold?
ANNA: I'm so cold.
PREP ROOM: You had a long life.
ANNA: You had a long life.
ANNA: You look so peaceful.
ANNA: I'm scared. I'm so scared.
ON PAUL: The music's strangely distorted now. Almost silent. As if we were inside Paul's head.
PREP ROOM: Anna reaches forward. Her hand disappears into the thick blackness. She snatches her hand back. Scared. Then. .a CHILD'S HAND darts out of the darkness. Grabs Anna's wrist. Pulling her in with surprising strength. Anna struggles to free herself. But the hand drags her deeper into the darkness. The door slams shut behind her.
ANNA: Who are you?
GIRL: You promised me so many things.
GIRL: I am you. I've been waiting for you. You shouldn't have disappointed me.
OLD WOMAN: You're not ready.
ON CASKET: The Old Woman. Her long hair braided. She looks serene.
ELIOT: ( to Jack without looking up ) Can I help you?
ELIOT: Then perhaps you can help me. Could you throw these away for me?
ELIOT: Eliot turns and arranges fresh flowers in the vase.
ON JACK: as he looks at the wilted flowers. He crushes a petal then sniffs his fingers.
VIEWING ROOM: Jack looks up. Eliot's watching him carefully.
ELIOT: They belong in the garbage.
ELIOT: I've seen you round here before.
ELIOT: Did you know Mrs. Whitehall?
JACK: I thought it was Miss Bryant's funeral.
ELIOT: Ah. Miss Bryant. No. Her funeral's not until Friday.
JACK: Where is she now?
ELIOT: She's downstairs.
JACK: Why? Because she's not ready.
ELIOT: Why? Because she's not ready.
JACK: ( NODS )
ELIOT: And you are?
JACK: Jack holds out his hand. A serious look on his face. Eliot's amused. He shakes Jack's hand.
ELIOT: Well Jack. What did you think?
JACK: About what?
ELIOT: Mrs. Whitehall's funeral. Did you find it interesting?
JACK: ( SHRUGS )
ELIOT: Oh. I see.
JACK: Are all funerals the same?
ELIOT: No Jack. They're never the same. Each one is special. The dead always speak to us in different ways.
JACK: ( CURIOUS NOW )
ELIOT: It was a pleasure talking to you Jack.
ELIOT: ( ANGRY )
ELIOT: WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
ANNA: Is this the afterlife? Am I in heaven? Or am I in hell?
ANNA: The door.
ELIOT: ( GENTLY )
ANNA: I used to believe in God. I thought I'd see him when I died. Instead I saw you.
ANNA: ( WHISPERS )
ELIOT: You'll be at peace soon. I promise.
ANNA: She lets out a DESPONDENT SIGH. The SIGH carries into the next scene.
PAUL'S POV: Anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him. She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. Then her hand moves to her chest. There's a STRANGE WET SUCKING sound. .as Anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on the hook next to her bathrobe.
BATHROOM: ( WHISPERS )
PAUL: ( WHISPERS )
JACK: ( SHOUTS )
ANNA: What's that?
ELIOT: It's your dress. For your funeral. Your mother brought it round this morning.
ANNA: This isn't my dress. This is my mother's dress! It was supposed to be for her funeral. Why has she given it to me?
PREP ROOM: Eliot looks at it for a moment. Then glances over at Anna. She's still staring at the dress. He opens a drawer beneath the counter. It's full of rosaries and printed Holy cards. He quickly drops the rosary into the drawer. Closes it. Then turns back to Anna.
ANNA: It should have been her not me. She was the one dying. Not me.
ANNA: I'm not ready to die.
ELIOT: Why are you still struggling?
ANNA: ( PLAINTIVELY )
ELIOT: There's nothing out there for you
ON ELIOT: as he gets up and turns to Anna.
PREP ROOM: Anna looks at him calmly. We can't tell if she managed to get his keys or not. Eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels the gurney through the door. He steps back into the room. Nudges the door stop away with his foot.
ELIOT: I'll be back soon.
ANNA: ( begging the door to open )
ANNA: Anna looks around desperately. Sees a tray of instruments on the steel trolley. She scrambles over. Finds a pair of surgical pliers. She moves back to the door.
CASHIER: Thirty-four fifty.
CASHIER: Sir. Your change.
ANNA: ( DESPERATELY )
ANNA'S POV: Eliot's van pulls up in front of the house.
ENTRANCE HALL: Anna's trapped. We hear the CRUNCH of Eliot's footsteps on the gravel outside. Anna looks round desperately.
HALLWAY: Eliot turns towards her. then at the last moment changes his mind. Heads in the opposite direction towards the viewing room.
ANNA: ( DESPERATELY )
ANNA: Paul. Please pick up.
ANNA: ( FRENZIED WHISPER )
PAUL: Leave me alone.
ANNA: Suddenly the light comes on.
ELIOT: I'm the only one who can hear you now.
ELIOT: I'd be very careful if I were you. The dead have such a hold over the living.
ANNA: What do you mean?
ELIOT: ( nods to the phone ) He still feels your presence. You're only causing him more pain. If you really loved him, you'd accept your death and let him go.
ANNA: Then prove to me I'm really dead.
ELIOT: You people. You always need proof.
ON MIRROR: A PALE CADAVEROUS WOMAN. Sunken eyes. A blood-stained tear in the side of her RED SLIP.
UPSTAIRS ROOM: Anna's stunned. She moves closer to the mirror. Touches her reflection through a thin layer of dust.
ANNA: Why do I look like a corpse?
ELIOT: Because you are a corpse.
ON MIRROR: Anna stares blankly at her image in the mirror.
ANNA: I am dead.
UPSTAIRS ROOM: Eliot smiles. Like a father proud of his child's first step. Just then he notices something outside. We see a brief flicker of unease in Eliot's eyes.
ELIOT'S POV: Jack stands in the driveway holding his bicycle. Looking up at the Funeral Home. Transfixed.
JACK'S POV: Anna in her RED SLIP by the mirror. She looks frightening in the harsh light. Deathly pale. Like a ghost.
DRIVEWAY: Strangely Jack isn't scared. He continues staring up at the window. Calmly. Curiously.
ANNA: ( RELIEVED )
PAUL: Bad dream?
ANNA: I was dead. I had a car accident. Did you ever dream you were dead?
ANNA: PAUL ( O.C. )
ANNA: The light comes back on. Paul stands by the light switch.
ANNA: What are you doing?
PAUL: ( puts his finger to his lips ) Ssh. Don't talk so loud. You'll wake the neighbors.
ANNA: What neighbors? You don't have any
PAUL: Did you ever love me Anna?
ANNA: Aren't you going to pick it up?
ANNA: Is it always like this?
ELIOT: What do you mean?
ANNA: I thought when you died you wouldn't feel anything. You wouldn't feel any more pain. You wouldn't have to struggle anymore.
ELIOT: No. It's no problem at all.
ELIOT: I'll pick up the deceased from the hospital. Yes. This afternoon? That'll be fine. It's my pleasure Mr. Merano.
OLD GUY: Well here he is. Frank Merano.
ON BODY: FRANK ( 40s ), the top half of his head has been flattened. His head split open. Grotesquely distorting his face.
MORGUE: Eliot glances at the Assistant with disdain. Signs the release form and hands the clipboard back to the Old Guy.
PRINCIPAL: ( TO PAUL )
PAUL: Thank you.
PAUL: ( TURNS ) ( BEAT )
JACK: My name's Jack. Miss Bryant was my I saw her last night.
JACK: I was going past the funeral home. Miss Bryant stood there. In the window. In a red dress.
PAUL: ( IRRITATED )
JACK: You think I'm lying. I'm not lying.
PAUL: ( trying to remember his name ) Jack. I'm in no mood
JACK: She needs your help.
PAUL: ( SHOUTS )
PAUL: ( almost to himself ) I can't help her anymore.
JACK: Maybe you just don't love her anymore?
PAUL: You little fuck. You think this is funny?
STOCKY TEACHER: The CHILDREN stare at Paul. A SECURITY GUARD runs across talking into a walkie-talkie. Another TEACHER bends down.
TEACHER: Are you alright sweetie?
SECURITY GUARD: The police are on their way.
PAUL: Jack. I'm sorry.
SECURITY GUARD: Step back sir.
TOM: You're lucky.
PAUL: Am I?
TOM: They're not pressing charges.
TOM: What the hell's wrong with you? You're this close to fucking up your You know what he told me? He told me Anna's alive.
PAUL: ( suddenly looks up ) You know what he told me? He told me Anna's alive.
TOM: You didn't believe him did you?
PAUL: No. Of course not.
PAUL: It's just. I'm having these.
TOM: Nothing. Forget it.
PAUL: Nothing. Forget it.
ANNA'S POV: Frank stares back at her with open dull eyes. His face partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris.
PREP ROOM: Eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give Frank's face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of wire with a fishhook-like barb at each end.
ELIOT: His mouth. To keep it closed.
ELIOT: Now his eyes.
ANNA: Is this how you'll prepare my body?
ELIOT: No. There's no need. I had to rebuild his face. You're still beautiful.
ANNA: Does he have family?
ELIOT: Yes. A brother. He's coming in later.
ANNA: My mother. She didn't cry did she? When she came to see me?
ELIOT: ( shakes his head ) I'm sorry.
ANNA: And Paul?
ELIOT: It's not important anymore.
ANNA: I need to know.
ELIOT: ( HESITATES )
ANNA: I knew he wouldn't. He always got upset when I cried. He said crying never helped.
ELIOT: You should rest.
ELIOT: You're getting weaker. It's almost time.
ANNA: Can I ask you something?
ELIOT: Yes. Of course.
ANNA: Why do we die?
ELIOT: To make life important.
ON POLAROID: The Old Woman, Mrs. Whitehall, lying in her casket.
ROOM: Suddenly Eliot looks up sharply. As if someone had spoken to him.
ELIOT: Think nothing of it Mr. Houseman. No need to apologize.
ELIOT: I really enjoyed our time together.
ELIOT'S POV: A POLICE OFFICER stands at the front door. A SQUAD CAR parked on the driveway.
ELIOT'S ROOM: Eliot steps back. Calmly continues to dry his hands.
ELIOT: How can I help you Officer?
OFFICER: I'd like to see the body.
OFFICER: Frank Merano. I'm his brother. Vincent Merano? I called this morning.
ELIOT: Mr. Merano. Yes. Of course.
ELIOT: It's no trouble at all.
ELIOT: Your brother's here.
VINCENT: He looks so peaceful. You've done a beautiful job. Thank-you.
ELIOT: You should remember him as he used to be.
VINCENT: That's the schoolteacher isn't it?
ELIOT: ( QUICKLY )
VINCENT: Something's not right here.
ELIOT: ( looks up sharply ) Not right?
VINCENT: His smile. It was a bit more.
VINCENT: ON FRANK'S MOUTH Eliot manipulates Frank's lips.
ELIOT: ON FRANK'S MOUTH Eliot manipulates Frank's lips.
PREP ROOM: That's much better. Thank-you.
VINCENT: That's much better. Thank-you.
ELIOT: I'm glad I could help.
VINCENT: Do you mind if I have a couple of minutes alone with him?
ELIOT: No. Not at all. I'll wait outside.
VINCENT: I'm sorry. I didn't see.
VINCENT: Well. I guess I should be off then. I'll see you at the service. Thanks again.
ELIOT: I just told you. That was your brother. You had an accident. You're dead. Why do you people never listen to me?
ELIOT: No. It's not a gift. It's a curse.
ELIOT: I take care of each of you as if you were my children. I wash the shit from your bodies. I dress you. I do everything to make you look more beautiful than when you were alive. And what do you do?
ELIOT: You argue with me. As if it were my fault you're dead. As if I was to blame. What? You're not talking to me now? You don't want to?
PREP ROOM: From Eliot's reaction it seems as if Frank has started to talk again.
ELIOT: No. Now I don't want to talk to you
JACK: I'm off to school now.
JACK'S POV: Frank Merano lies nestled in the velvet interior. His face placid. No sign of the gaudy make-up.
VIEWING ROOM: Jack stares in fascination at Frank's body. He reaches into the casket. Touches Frank's cold hand. In the b.g. Eliot walks into the viewing room. He stops surprised. Watches Jack intently.
ON JACK: ( TO FRANK )
JACK: ( TO FRANK )
VIEWING ROOM: Jack turns quickly. Eliot stands over him.
ELIOT: You have empathy with the dead. You're drawn to them. Just as they're drawn to you. It's a rare gift.
ELIOT: I know you saw Anna.
ELIOT: You're frightened by it. I was scared too the first time. But you shouldn't be. Christ had the same gift. He raised Lazarus and spoke to the dead.
JACK: ( INTRIGUED )
ELIOT: You've spoken to others?
JACK: You've spoken to others?
ELIOT: Yes. Many others.
JACK: Who was the first one you spoke to?
ELIOT: My mother. You shouldn't be afraid.
ELIOT: You shouldn't be afraid.
ANNA: Your fingernails are dirty.
ANNA: Your hands are normally so clean.
ELIOT: I've been gardening.
ANNA: Is it sunny outside?
ELIOT: Yes. The tulips love the sun.
ANNA: I miss the sun.
ANNA: Are they your favorite flower?
ELIOT: Tulips? Yes. I think so.
ANNA: I thought it'd be lilies. White lilies. Don't they symbolize death?
ELIOT: No. They symbolize purity.
ANNA: And tulips?
ELIOT: Unrequited love.
ANNA: Eliot softly washes her legs.
ELIOT: A beautiful flower. They need shade and lots of water.
ANNA: What do they symbolize?
ELIOT: ( DISTRACTEDLY )
ANNA: ( DISTRACTEDLY )
ANNA: Roses are red, violets are blue.
ANNA: No. Leave it on. It's so peaceful.
STREET: The light's turned green. The DRIVERS HONK angrily. Paul doesn't hear them. He places his hand against the plate glass. Stunned.
ELIOT: Mr. Conran. A pleasure.
ELIOT: I love gardening, but I'm not sure gardening loves me anymore.
PAUL: She's not dead is she?
ELIOT: ( AMUSED )
PAUL: Someone saw her.
ELIOT: I'm sorry?
PAUL: One of Anna's students. In the window.
ELIOT: Do you mean Jack?
PAUL: You know him?
ELIOT: Of course I know him. He's often round here. He seems to have a strange fascination with death. He's eleven years old Mr. Conran. And like all young boys has a vivid imagination. Now if you'll excuse me
PAUL: I don't think he imagined it. I think he really saw her.
ELIOT: Maybe you just want to believe he saw her.
PAUL: Fuck you.
ELIOT: Mr. Conran!
PAUL: ( SHOUTS )
ELIOT: Mr. Conran. I think you should leave before I call the police.
PAUL: What's down there?
PAUL: She's in here isn't she? Give me the
PAUL: Give me the fucking key.
PAUL: I'm here Anna.
PAUL: I can't live without you.
PAUL: Eliot gently puts his hand on Paul's shoulder.
ELIOT: Mr. Conran. She's dead.
ELIOT: I know what you're going through. Denial's a natural part of grieving.
PAUL: She needs my help.
ELIOT: You can't help her anymore. Believe me.
PAUL: I need you to issue a search warrant.
PAUL: ( LOUDLY )
TOM: Paul. Sit down.
TOM: ( FIRMLY )
TOM: Just what the hell do you think you're doing? I got a call from Eliot Deane. Are you out of your fucking mind?
PAUL: Anna's not dead Tom. He won't let me see her. He's keeping her there
TOM: Anna was in a car accident. Her car was wrecked Paul. Remember? It's downstairs.
PAUL: She's not dead.
TOM: Here's the Coroner's report.
PAUL: ( shows file to Tom ) The paramedics phoned it in. They only checked for eye dilation and pulse. The doctor signed the death certificate without even seeing her body.
TOM: ( IRRITATED )
PAUL: There was no EEG. Nothing. He could have drugged her to make it look like she was dead.
TOM: Drugged her? Are you serious?
JEFF: There are drugs like that chief. Hydronium Bromide. Total paralysis within seconds. The heartbeat slows to almost nothing.
PAUL: See? I'm telling you. She's not dead. The boy at school. Jack. He saw her.
VINCENT: She was on the slab. Dead.
PAUL: I've seen dead bodies. Believe me, she was definitely dead.
VINCENT: I've seen dead bodies. Believe me, she was definitely dead.
PAUL: Tom. Just go down there and check the place out.
TOM: On what grounds Paul? Do you have any No. But
PAUL: No. But
TOM: Do you have anything?
PAUL: I think she called me.
TOM: Called you?
PAUL: ( WEAKLY )
VINCENT: Collect or long distance?
TOM: First you hit a fucking kid. Then you attack Deane. And now you're telling me your dead girlfriend called you? What the fuck's going on? You're loosing it Paul.
TOM: I know you feel guilty but you've got to pull yourself together.
PAUL: Maybe you're right. But why won't he let me see her?
TOM: Look Paul. The funeral's tomorrow. You'll see her then. It'll help. It will give you closure. Trust me.
JACK: You said you could teach me.
ELIOT: It's only a hole in the ground. I'm digging it for
JACK: Miss Bryant.
ELIOT: Exactly. For Anna. She belongs here.
JACK: Because she's dead.
ELIOT: No. Because there's no life left in her.
ELIOT: Don't you see? I have no choice. I'm the only one who can see all these corpses. Wandering the earth aimlessly. All they do is piss and shit. Suffocating us with their stench. Doing nothing with their lives. Taking the air away from those who actually want to live. I have to bury them all. I have no choice.
ELIOT: You did well this morning.
ANNA: This morning?
ELIOT: When Paul came. You did the right thing. You let him go.
ANNA: He'll be all right now? Won't he?
ANNA: ( CONFUSED )
ELIOT: Tomorrow's your funeral.
ANNA: I told you. You only had three days.
ELIOT: I told you. You only had three days.
ELIOT: I told you to use your time well.
ANNA: I need to. I have so many regrets. I have nothing but regrets.
ANNA: That's why I'm here isn't it? To be
ELIOT: You're here to understand your life. So you can finally be at peace.
ANNA: I wanted a different life.
ELIOT: Then why didn't you do anything about it?
ANNA: No matter what I did everything just stayed the same. I'd wake up. I'd shower. Sit in the same traffic everyday on my way to work. Go home. Go to sleep. Then wake again.
ELIOT: What did you really want from life?
ANNA: I just wanted to be happy.
ELIOT: ( DERISIVELY )
ANNA: I don't know. Don't you understand? That's the whole point. I don't know.
ELIOT: Yes you do! You're just too scared to admit it to yourself.
ANNA: I don't want to talk about it anymore. I just want this to be over.
ELIOT: What did you want from life?
ANNA: I don't fucking know!
ELIOT: WHAT DID YOU WANT ANNA? I WANTED LOVE! OK!
ANNA: ( SCREAMS BACK )
ANNA: ( QUIETLY )
ELIOT: You had love. Paul loved you.
ANNA: No. You don't understand. I was scared. I wanted to love but I didn't know how. I was.
ANNA: When I was a child. I learnt that love. That when you love someone. You get hurt. So I learned not to love. That way no one could ever hurt me again.
ANNA: I was always pushing Paul away. He thought I didn't love him.
ELIOT: Did you?
ANNA: He was the only one I ever loved. But I never told him that. And then he stopped loving me.
ELIOT: What would you do if you had another
ELIOT: Well? Isn't this what you wanted?
OLD WOMEN: Spit it out.
OLD WOMEN: Spit it out.
ANNA: INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT Anna's eyes snap open. She's still in the Prep Room. She steps back from the doorway. Terrified.
ELIOT: I thought you were different. You all say you're scared of death. But the truth is you're more scared of life.
FUNERAL HOME: Paul strains to open the window when suddenly. he's caught in a circle of bright light. Paul turns quickly. A DARK FIGURE stands over him. Menacing.
MAN'S VOICE: What the fuck are you doing here?
TOM: I'm taking you home.
JACK: Don't be scared. It's better this way.
ON ANNA: Her eyes still closed.
ON ELIOT: Eliot pauses. Too confused to look back at her.
ELIOT: ( BEAT )
ELIOT: ( GENTLY )
ELIOT: You have to look beautiful for your
ON AMPOULE: We glimpse the label: HYDRONIUM BROMIDE.
PREP ROOM: This is how they'll all remember you.
ELIOT: This is how they'll all remember you.
ANNA: Can I see myself for the last time?
ON MIRROR: Anna looks peaceful. Beautiful. Serene.
ANNA: Is this the end?
PREP ROOM: Eliot glances anxiously at the fogged mirror, then at Anna.
ANNA: You lied to me.
ELIOT: Anna. We've been through this before. You're just imagining
ANNA: You lied to me.
ANNA: ( WHISPERS )
ON ANNA: .delicately closes Anna's eyelids.
ON CASKET: Anna lies in an open casket. Her eyes closed. She can hear the DISTORTED VOICE of the Priest.
VIEWING ROOM: Eliot gestures to Beatrice. Diane wheels her to the casket. Beatrice looks at Anna for a moment, then touches the violets in Anna's hands.
DIANE: Violets. They were her favorite flowers. How did you know?
ELIOT: Violets just seemed appropriate somehow.
PAUL'S POV: Anna looks serene.
VIEWING ROOM: Paul takes out the ring box from his pocket. Gently slides the engagement ring onto Anna's stiff finger. Suddenly he looks alarmed. Turns quickly to Tom.
TOM: ( WHISPERS )
PAUL: She's so cold.
PAUL: I'm sorry Anna.
TOM: ( shakes his head ) She's at peace now.
ON COFFIN: A drop of blood falls onto the polished wood.
VIEWING ROOM: Eliot stares at the blood for a moment. Takes out a pristine white handkerchief. Carefully wipes off the blood. Then places his hand on the coffin.
ELIOT: ( SOFTLY )
TOM: You sure you're going to be OK?
PAUL: Yeah. Thanks Tom.
ON POLAROIDS: We pan slowly across the other photographs we saw before. But now we look at them differently. In some faces there is the glimmer of life. In some a despairing pleading look. In others passive resignation.
ELIOT'S ROOM: Eliot moves towards the window.
ELIOT'S POV: The dark cemetery. In the distance flickering candles illuminate Anna's grave.
ELIOT'S ROOM: They've said their good byes and gone back to their TV dinners and shopping malls. Thinking that this is never going to happen to them. Until it's their turn to be buried. Think about it Anna.
ELIOT: They've said their good byes and gone back to their TV dinners and shopping malls. Thinking that this is never going to happen to them. Until it's their turn to be buried. Think about it Anna.
ELIOT: .think about it while you still can.
PAUL: You said she was alive.
JACK: I never said she was alive. I just said I saw her.
PAUL: You need a ride?
PAUL: OK. See you.
JACK: Mr. Conran?
JACK'S POV: Eliot stands in the window smiling at him.
PAUL: Go to hell.
ELIOT: ( AMUSED )
PAUL: I know she wasn't dead.
ELIOT: Wasn't she?
ELIOT: Mr. Conran. You come to my Funeral Home, making wild accusations. You have no idea what happens when someone dies. What happens to their body. What happens to their soul.
ELIOT: Maybe she's still alive. You obviously don't believe a word I say. So why don't you go and find out for yourself Mr. Conran. Find out whether she's alive or dead.
PAUL: ( LOUDLY )
ELIOT: You don't have much time left.
FATHER GRAHAM: Please. Paul. You're not well.
PAUL: Come on. Come on.
CAR: Paul looks through the front windshield. Nothing. He frowns. Where did the ambulance go?
UP AHEAD: We see the Funeral Home. Bone white in the moonlight. The cemetery next to it.
PAUL: Anna. I'm here. Please God. Anna.
ANNA: Baby. Thank God.
PAUL: Baby. Thank God.
ANNA: You came back for me.
PAUL: I came back for you. You're safe now.
ANNA: ( SMILES )
PAUL: ( SMILES )
PAUL: Paul looks round desperately. Runs between the stone crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her.
PAUL: Just then he glimpses SOMETHING MOVE among the trees. Runs over. Nothing. The cemetery is empty. The trees appear to SHIMMER for a moment. Paul shivers. Pulls his jacket around him. He doesn't notice the candles on Anna's grave behind him suddenly BLOW OUT.
PAUL: Suddenly the interior light in his car comes on. Paul looks at the car nervously. He heads over to it. Apprehensive. Then. the car door slowly CLICKS open. Paul stops. Stares into the car. There's no one there.
ANNA: Are we going home?
ANNA: Or do you want to make love here?
PAUL: Where did you go?
ANNA: ( WHISPERS )
ANNA: I love you. I always did.
PAUL: ( ALARMED )
ANNA: It's only the scissors.
PAUL: Scissors? What scissors?
ANNA: Scissors. For your clothes. Eliot just put them on the table.
ANNA: You're safe now. We're finally together.
PAUL: Where am I?
ELIOT: You're in a funeral home.
PAUL: I'm not dead.
ELIOT: You had a car accident. You swerved off the road. On the way to the cemetery. Hit a tree.
PAUL: I saw Anna. You buried her alive.
ELIOT: I'm sorry Mr. Conran. You never made it to the cemetery. You never saw Anna. You're dead.
PAUL: I'm not dead.
ELIOT: Your skull was crushed. Your spinal cord pulverized. Your brain cells are slowly dying. Your body's already decomposing.
PAUL: I'm not dead.
ELIOT: You people. You all say the same thing.
