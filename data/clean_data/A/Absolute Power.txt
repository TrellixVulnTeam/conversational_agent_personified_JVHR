COLLIN: Nothing to tell. He screamed.
RUSSELL: And you heard no sounds of violence 'til then?
BURTON: ( beat ) Nothing we haven't heard before.
BURTON: Maybe I should call the police Bill? Why don't you think about Take a second and just think about Think. real. fucking. hard.
RUSSELL: ( soft ) ( beat starting to move toward him ) ( closing in on Burton, furious )
BURTON: He is strong enough to snap her neck with one hand.
BURTON: ( backing away ) Probably not a good idea.

RICHMOND: . But she's dead.
RUSSELL: . I'll take care of everything just like I always do.
COLLIN: In reply, Collin dashes back toward the bed table, grabs Russell's purse, snaps it shut, tucks it under one arm and leaves. Burton flicks the light out, closes the door. The room is lit by moonlight now. Christy looks beautiful and still. HOLD for a moment.
BURTON: In reply, Collin dashes back toward the bed table, grabs Russell's purse, snaps it shut, tucks it under one arm and leaves. Burton flicks the light out, closes the door. The room is lit by moonlight now. Christy looks beautiful and still. HOLD for a moment.
BURTON: Collin, looking around the table and the letter opener is And without another word, they bolt out the door.
COLLIN: And without another word, they bolt out the door.
COLLIN: ( still the smile ) I got his license number.
RUSSELL: ( close to losing it ) Gee, guys, maybe it was the bogeyman don't forget to check under the bed ( exploding ) You may have buried us!
COLLIN: relax, I got his license number, remember?
RUSSELL: ( whirling on him ) you think he's going to just sit around waiting for us? take it easy, Miss Russell
COLLIN: take it easy, Miss Russell
BURTON: ( trying for calm ) everybody shut up, all right?

LUTHER: The jogging.
LUTHER: Dumb way to start this, I guess. Wanted to talk to you.
LUTHER: Wanted to talk to you.
KATE: Believe it or not, the weather. Nights are starting to get cold.
LUTHER: Believe it or not, the weather. Nights are starting to get cold.
KATE: That happens this time of year.
LUTHER: I was thinking of maybe relocating. Someplace with a kinder climate. I just wanted to check it out with you first. . you're the only family I've
KATE: Luther, you don't have me.
LUTHER: you know what it's like being the only kid in show and tell who got to talk about visiting day?
KATE: you know what it's like being the only kid in show and tell who got to talk about visiting day?
LUTHER: This move I'm talking permanent, you understand.
KATE: We don't see each other anyway we haven't seen each other since Mom died and that's a year. Look, you chose your life. You had that right. You were never around for me. Fine. But I have no plans to be around for you.
KATE: ( louder now ) wait a minute you're lying about something, aren't you?
LUTHER: are you active again? is that why you're here now?
KATE: are you active again? is that why you're here now?
LUTHER: Kate moves in close now
KATE: I don't believe you Christ, Father, what have you
SETH: Christy Sullivan?
MEDICAL EXAMINER: ( nods ) Wife of Walter most likely came home and stumbled onto a some burglary.
LAURA SIMON: I wish my carpets were this clean. And I can't find a single decent You serious, Laura?
SETH: You serious, Laura?
LAURA SIMON: ( bewildered ) It's like Mary Poppins was here.
SETH: Could someone have let him in?
LAURA SIMON: Sorry, Seth, but the entire Sullivan household went to Barbados two days ago.
SETH: Thank you for your support.
LAURA SIMON: Wait it gets worse the shots came from here. If she interrupted a burglary, she should have been here she was killed where she is all the blood patterns indicate that. But she was looking toward the bed what in hell was she looking at?
LAURA SIMON: Looks like someone sat here but I couldn't find any prints. You think Sullivan holed up in the chair and watched his wife I hope not he's such a great man.
SETH: I hope not he's such a great man.
SETH: ( as he moves past ) Careful digging that out.
MEDICAL EXAMINER: Looks like he tried to strangle So he tried to strangle her, then went to the door and shot her from He also inspected her vagina.
SETH: So he tried to strangle her, then went to the door and shot her from He also inspected her vagina.
MEDICAL EXAMINER: He also inspected her vagina.
SETH: He did what? Why?
LAURA SIMON: Maybe he couldn't remember if he fucked her.
SETH: ( has to laugh ) A strong burglar with a weak mind obviously another open and shut
SETH: Mr. Sullivan? I'm Seth Frank, senior homicide detective for Middleton County
SANDY LORD: ( protectively ) my client is in no mood for conversation, sir.
WALTER SULLIVAN: It's all right, Sandy you're in charge of the case?
SETH: ( nods ) I have to ask some questions, but it can be tomorrow.
WALTER SULLIVAN: You want what, positive identification? Yes, that was my wife. Anything else?
SETH: ( notebook in hand ) You'd been in Barbados for two ( nods ) I took the entire staff down always do this time of year.
WALTER SULLIVAN: ( nods ) I took the entire staff down always do this time of year.
SETH: But Mrs. Sullivan didn't come.
WALTER SULLIVAN: She was, had it all planned, but you know women, they change their
SANDY LORD: I think that's enough for today.
SETH: ( beat ) I have to ask about the vault.
WALTER SULLIVAN: You mean the contents of the vault of course Sandy, you go on, I'm all Really. Go to the reception obviously I can't make it, but I'm sure everyone will understand.
WALTER SULLIVAN: I know it's not the contents You mean the chair. You have to ask about the chair.
SETH: ( soft ) Yessir, I do.
WALTER SULLIVAN: But why? Are they connected?
SETH: I think someone sat in it and I think that someone may have been involved in the murder. You were my father's hero, Mr. Sullivan, I promise you this won't make my highlight reel.
WALTER SULLIVAN: I'd hoped I could satisfy her. but you know. she had needs and she didn't want to go behind my back. she suggested the chair. she hoped I might get to like sitting there. . I didn't. I've tried for eighty years to live a decent life. I've given a billion dollars to charity. If this comes to trial, none of that will be remembered I'll just go out as the joke of the world.
SETH: I understand, sir; I'll do what I Will you listen to me whine? Please forgive me, Mr. Frank. Just do your job. And I'll do mine.
WALTER SULLIVAN: ( beat ) Will you listen to me whine? Please forgive me, Mr. Frank. Just do your job. ( beat ) And I'll do mine.
SANDY LORD: Mr. President.
RICHMOND: Take a walk with me.
RICHMOND: Tell me about Walter how is he?
SANDY LORD: Eighty and alone, Mr. President.
RICHMOND: He understands officially my hands are tied?
SANDY LORD: Mr. President, he's touched at your concern.
RICHMOND: Any news of the killer? Well, why isn't there? Who's in charge of the case?
SANDY LORD: Top man eight years homicide work in New York. But I understand how you feel it's hard to be patient.
RICHMOND: ( terribly upset ) No one understands how I feel I'm supposed to have all this power but I can't help my oldest friend you know and I know that more than any man alive Walter Sullivan put me here and now when he most needs me, he must feel abandoned.
RICHMOND: I'll hold a press conference and I'll have Walter come and I will embrace him before the world.
SANDY LORD: He'll treasure that, Mr. President. What a generous gesture. Thank you. Thank you. Damn tennis elbow is killing me.
RICHMOND: ( quick smile ) Damn tennis elbow is killing me.
RICHMOND: ( throws off his jacket, This thing's worse, Gloria. I need to see a doctor.
RUSSELL: The country would have to be informed, Mr. President.
RICHMOND: What happened to my right to I think she nicked a tendon.
RUSSELL: Burton says it's a flesh wound
RICHMOND: ( to Burton ) when did you become such an expert, Bill? Ever been ( quietly ) Yes, sir. Many times.
BURTON: ( quietly ) Yes, sir. Many times.
RUSSELL: Are you serious about that press conference, Alan?
RICHMOND: Of course I am Walter's been like a father to me.
RUSSELL: Shall I bring Mrs. Richmond home for it?
RICHMOND: I think Mrs. Richmond's mission to help the poor in Asia should not be interrupted. We know anything yet?
RUSSELL: We checked his license plate he stole the car from a police impoundment lot.
RICHMOND: We're not dealing with a fool Has he initiated contact?
RUSSELL: Burton doesn't think he will.
RICHMOND: I agree. Sorry about my behavior won't happen again; think of it as a blip on the screen. And as far as I'm concerned, so is he.
RUSSELL: He could be a little more than that, Alan he saw.
RICHMOND: He saw nothing a drunk woman who liked rough sex too much. And he's a burglar. Who's going to believe him? After all, it's not as if he had evidence or anything.
NIGHT: Luther holds it. It's the middle of the night. Luther turns the weapon over and over in his big hands.
VALERIE: ( as they study the You always did disappear good, You mean I've got a weak face. Thanks, Val.
LUTHER: You mean I've got a weak face. Thanks, Val.
VALERIE: You're lucky is all some of my customers, they stand out no matter what. How many passports you need?
VALERIE: How many passports you need?
LUTHER: ( thinks ) Four should cover it.
VALERIE: ( writes this down ) Now you'll want different looks, and matching international driver's licenses I'll throw in some dummy credit cards, seeing it's you. How the rugs I made you holding up?
LUTHER: They're good. Beards and mustaches, too.
VALERIE: ( pleased ) I try to give value for money. Leaving the country permanent?
LUTHER: It may come to that.
VALERIE: Matter where you've been? I hate doing those goddam Asian passport stamps.
LUTHER: Europe's fine. Maybe the Caribbean for winters. When can I pick up?
VALERIE: Usually takes some time, but for you, I'll rush it.
LUTHER: Thanks, Val. I've always been able to count on you.
LUTHER: I don't want to know what you're into, but leaving forever.
VALERIE: I don't want to know what you're into, but leaving forever.
LUTHER: Finish it.
VALERIE: I never figured you for a runner thirty percent of my runners kill themselves within five years.
LUTHER: ( kisses her forehead ) Five years doesn't sound so bad to me just now.
SETH: See if any of this makes sense.
SETH: I am Christy Sullivan and I walk in and surprise a burglar.
LAURA: Now you're the burglar coming out of the vault and being surprised.
SETH: Gold star. I draw my gun
LAURA: ( cutting in ) then why do you bother to strangle her when you could just
SETH: That's nothing why do I bother to have her strip and then put her clothes back on?
LAURA: There I can help you see, before you were a burglar you were a dry cleaner and you still love beautiful clothes.
SETH: And I dress her because?
LAURA: She was a good customer and you didn't want her embarrassed when the police came.
SETH: She had a point-21 blood alcohol level. she was too drunk to drive. I've checked every cab and limo company in the area and not one of them knows anything. Someone drove her home. Goddamit, who? And why haven't they come Maybe whoever drove her home killed her.
LAURA: Maybe whoever drove her home killed her.
SETH: You saying the burglar drove her I hate this case.
TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN: Lieutenant? sorry to bother you
SETH: Good service, thanks.
TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN: ( dazzling smile Part of the job.
SETH: Oh yeah remember that bullet hole in the wall? Had the lab dig out the slug guess what no slug why does the burglar take the time to do that?
LAURA: Different from the one in her
SETH: ( getting more and Oh I like that a lot two different guns means two different burglars. Two guys broke in? And they both went out the window? ( big ) And oh, by the way, why does he or they go out the window in the first place when he or they got in by breaking a zillion- dollar security system?
SETH: ( whirling ) ( in doorway ) A Bill Burton of the Secret Service in the parking lot.
COP: ( in doorway ) A Bill Burton of the Secret Service in the parking lot.
SETH: ( gives papers to Here, you solve the goddam thing. ( as he starts away ) Did I mention that I hate this case? I really truly hate this case you cannot imagine how much I hate it
BURTON: ( as they shake ) Bill Burton, hi
SETH: hi, Seth Frank
BURTON: I know you must be going crazy but the boss is very interested in your progress. Maybe we can help each other.
SETH: What did you have in mind?
BURTON: You know how close he and Sullivan The minute anything breaks, if you'd call me, I'd tell the President. That way, he'd be the first to alert Mr. Sullivan it would mean a lot to him. And any red tape you want cut done. Here are my numbers.
BURTON: ( getting in ) Still trying to figure out what might have happened
SETH: Still trying to figure out what might have happened
BURTON: I loved playing Sherlock You Secret Service guys do that?
SETH: ( surprised ) You Secret Service guys do that?
BURTON: I was State Trooper here ten years ago before the Government got me.
SETH: You're that Bill Burton.
BURTON: I was younger and dumber then. Keep in touch.
WALTER SULLIVAN: ( noting McCarty's The chef makes them especially for me I promise you they're You're a salesman, Mr. Sullivan.
WALTER SULLIVAN: This is a new arena for me, but from what I'm told, you have a flawless reputation, Mister McCarty which is why I need to employ you. I have no idea who I'm after. Until I do, you will have to wait in Washington for instructions.
WALTER SULLIVAN: I have no idea who I'm after. Until I do, you will have to wait in Washington for instructions.
WALTER SULLIVAN: When I was 10 my father died he was a miner and lung disease killed him. I became rich at 25 and the first thing I did was purchase that mine, close it, and give every miner there fifty thousand dollars to retire on. You will come to Washington, Mr. McCarty. You will put one million dollars expenses into the Swiss bank account of your choosing. And, when the time comes, two million dollars a bullet. You are a salesman, sir.
WALTER SULLIVAN: Selling sin is easy.
DAY: PULL BACK to reveal. . Seth and Laura, in his office. The mug shot is on his desk, along with some folders. Seth beckons to her.
LAURA: ( studying photo ) Who is he?
SETH: Luther Whitney one of the great thieves of the
SETH: Been going nuts with this thing, up all night and I remembered your notion how it might be two burglars, and around dawn I thought, wait, what if it wasn't two burglars but what if it was one guy trying to throw us off by making it look like two? Called a buddy at the Bureau they keep track of this stuff internationally he says maybe only a half a dozen guys alive could have pulled off the Sullivan job I'm tracing all six but Whitney's the only one lives in Washington. Why haven't I ever heard of him?
LAURA: Why haven't I ever heard of him?
SETH: Because he hasn't been arrested in thirty years.
LAURA: ( indicating mug shot ) This his graduation picture from ( waving her off ) Ancient history he wasn't a jewel thief back then. Just a kid, just part of a gang, a three- time loser. But since he got out the last time, he's only worked and no one's touched him. He gets questioned whenever anything big comes up. But nothing sticks.
SETH: ( waving her off ) Ancient history he wasn't a jewel thief back then. Just a kid, just part of a gang, a three- time loser. But since he got out the last time, he's only worked and no one's touched him. He gets questioned whenever anything big comes up. But nothing sticks.
LAURA: ( really excited now ) Seth we can make this stick I'll bet you anything this is our guy a local? can't ask for ( makes a face ) We've got a problem.
SETH: ( makes a face ) We've got a problem.
LAURA: Whitney hasn't killed anyone in 45 Laura doesn't get it.
SETH: Whitney hasn't killed anyone in 45 Laura doesn't get it.
SETH: Big deal, so he's a veteran.
LAURA: Big deal, so he's a veteran.
SETH: Not just a veteran a wounded Got his combat record here. Battles, commendations, decorations up the kazoo. Lives alone on his disability. Says he does anyway. And I don't do war heroes.
LUTHER: ( not looking ) Boy, you must be smart.
SETH: ( really taken aback ) Usually takes a week for you guys to get to me. ( turns, smiles ) You look just like your picture, Seth. I'm Luther Whitney.
LUTHER: Usually takes a week for you guys to get to me. You look just like your picture, Seth. I'm Luther Whitney.
LUTHER: So, do you want my confession now or after coffee?
SETH: ( doing the same ) Before I send you away for life, I should probably check out your Watched the Bullets game with Red Bransford. Prison buddy of mine runs a bar want to question me about the game? I'm probably
LUTHER: Watched the Bullets game with Red Bransford. Prison buddy of mine runs a bar want to question me about the game? I'm probably
SETH: You been following the case?
LUTHER: ( nods vigorously ) I love true crime
SETH: F.B.I. feels only a few guys could have handled something as hard as the Sullivan job. I've got a list here; you're on I wish it was true. Your robber actually went in the front door but came out down a rope in the dark in the middle of the night? If only I could do stuff like that I'd be the star of my A.A.R.P. Luther? Why was this so hard?
LUTHER: ( nothing shows ) I wish it was true. ( shakes his head ) Your robber actually went in the front door but came out down a rope in the dark in the middle of the night? ( as Seth nods; If only I could do stuff like that I'd be the star of my A.A.R.P. ( beat ) Luther? Why was this so hard?
SETH: ( beat ) Luther? Why was this so hard?
LUTHER: You want me to help solve your Just looking for insight. How would you scratch that how would one go about it? What kind of person do you think I should be looking for?
SETH: Just looking for insight. How would you scratch that how would one go about it? What kind of person do you think I should be looking for?
LUTHER: ( like a shot ) Older fella. Like me.
SETH: ( now he smiles ) Need patience. The secret is just research, research, research from everything I've read.
LUTHER: Need patience. The secret is just research, research, research from everything I've read.
SETH: Research for what?
LUTHER: Well, from what I can tell on the tube, it's not a small house. There had to be an architect, right? You'd be able to tell which one from public records in the library. And once you know the office, you could break in and find the plans and Xerox them, get them back before morning.
SETH: Not just steal them?
LUTHER: Seth breaking in isn't hard what's hard is breaking in so no one knows you've been there. Now, after the architect, next you'd want the contractor's office and the security company's office. You know the skill involved breaking the security of a security company? I wonder how those guys do it?
SETH: Why go to all that trouble?
LUTHER: Papers said he kept the money in a vault, yes? Well, I'm guessing there was probably some secret way to open must have been a lot of money Five million.
SETH: ( casually ) ( fascinated ) gizmo looked like a V.C.R. must have been a lot of money ( sipping casually; Five million.
LUTHER: ( fascinated ) gizmo looked like a V.C.R. must have been a lot of money ( sipping casually; Five million.
SETH: gizmo looked like a V.C.R. must have been a lot of money Five million.
LUTHER: ( shaking his head ) ( beat ) must have been a lot of money ( sipping casually; a pause ) Five million.
SETH: ( sipping casually; Five million.
SETH: Why's that funny?
LUTHER: The way you said it as if you were trying to surprise me.
SETH: ( smiles ) I was trying to surprise you.
LUTHER: ( smiles back ) There you go.
SETH: Would the burglar use a disguise?
LUTHER: Seth, you've got to get with the program you expect to catch this guy most likely it is a guy, am I right? Some kind of weird Maybe like you.
SETH: Maybe like you.
LUTHER: ( couldn't agree more ) I'm the perfect prototype. ( sipping away ) But you see any face often enough, you'll start putting things together. That's why these top guys disguise themselves. I read a great article a couple of years back damn, I wish I could remember where anyway, it was about these makeup experts some of them use wigmakers, people like ( flipping a page ) Go on about the wigmakers.
SETH: ( flipping a page ) Go on about the wigmakers.
LUTHER: ( glancing at his watch ) I'd love that but I'm late as it is got to get my pacemaker ( he likes Seth ) all this excitement, you ( and he likes Luther ) A ) You don't have a pacemaker, and B ) I'll be back tomorrow.
SETH: ( and he likes Luther ) A ) You don't have a pacemaker, and B ) I'll be back tomorrow.
LUTHER: Tomorrow is promised to no one.
LUTHER: Not 'til morning? I'll be by early
LUTHER: ( sadly, muttering ) Katie darling, you've gotta try real food sometime.
RICHMOND: . it is here, at this courthouse, that Christine Sullivan's killer will be tried for his crime.
LUTHER: Turn that off, okay?
BARTENDER: ( finishing up the In a sec.
RICHMOND: As you know, I came from an impoverished family in an impoverished town but we lived with our doors unlocked.
RICHMOND: We are locking our hearts to the cries of the weary, we are locking our hearts to the poor and their
LUTHER: ( politely ) Put it back on.
BARTENDER: ( starting to argue ) You said
LUTHER: ( cutting through ) Do it
LUTHER: You heartless prick you fucking bastard
LUTHER: ( whispered now ) I'm not running not from you. ( beat ) I'm going to bring you down.
RUSSELL: He was in the building he took a guided tour.
RUSSELL: I've never dealt with blackmail
BURTON: ( trying for calm ) he doesn't want money
RUSSELL: ( exploding ) you a mind reader too?
BURTON: ( under control ) No, I just looked on the back ( shows her )
RUSSELL: ( reading ) 'I don't want money.'
LUTHER: ( admiringly ) This guy sure has the guts of a burglar. Wish we had him.
RUSSELL: You finished your recruiting speech? Because I'd like to know how I handle this.
BURTON: Like you handled the letter
RUSSELL: Gee, Bill, that could be construed as criticism. Do you really want me as an enemy?
BURTON: Miss Russell, I should have called the police that night. But I was weak. You convinced me to stay silent. I regret that. Know this: every time I see your face I want to rip your throat
RUSSELL: Fine you win the pissing what should I do?
BURTON: Nothing because he's making a terrible mistake, he thinks he has time he doesn't Seth Frank's too good. He'll bring him in.
RUSSELL: Then what?
COLLIN: ( his first words ) Then I kill him.
SETH: ( trying for a smile ) For a tough prosecutor, you don't resemble your reputation, Miss ( the same ) Is that good or bad?
KATE: ( the same ) Is that good or bad?
SETH: What would you do if I just turned around and left?
KATE: Report you as an incompetent.
SETH: ( a real smile now ) You're exactly like your reputation, Miss Whitney
SETH: ( the instant I'm assuming your father's a big part of you
KATE: You think it's all coincidence? He's a thief and you just happen to be the toughest prosecutor in the area?
SETH: You think it's all coincidence? He's a thief and you just happen to be the toughest prosecutor in the area?
KATE: ( just amazed ) Wow that never crossed my mind you think there might be some connection? Like maybe I'm somehow compensating? I better write that down.
SETH: Luther disappeared.
SETH: I think you can help me.
KATE: Lieutenant I don't know the man he was in jail when I was a kid, when he got out my mother and I went off to live by ourselves. We don't make contact. He doesn't care about me. I've seen him all of once this past year.
SETH: Couple days ago. He said he might be going away. There. I just helped you. Can I go back to work Any idea where he might have gone?
KATE: Couple days ago. He said he might be going away. There. I just helped you. Can I go back to work Any idea where he might have gone?
SETH: ( shakes his head ) Any idea where he might have gone?
KATE: ( snappishly ) Quit wasting my time if he doesn't want you to find him, you're not going to find him.
SETH: You saying he's left town, skipped the country, what?
KATE: I'm saying you won't recognize him. I'm saying he could be just around the corner he always kept a safe house
SETH: ( cutting in ) He never said
KATE: He never said
SETH: Then where'd you hear this?
KATE: my mother loved him, all right? Even after she left him even when she was dying she always talked about him 'If only he hadn't this,' 'if only he could have that'
SETH: I meet a lot of asshole cops like you guys who O.D.'d on Lady, I may be an asshole cop but you don't know me well enough to call me one
KATE: I meet a lot of asshole cops like you guys who O.D.'d on Lady, I may be an asshole cop but you don't know me well enough to call me one
SETH: Lady, I may be an asshole cop but you don't know me well enough to call me one
KATE: There's something else, isn't there? Something you want me to do? But you won't say -
KATE: How long did he live here?
SETH: Never been.
KATE: Never been.
SETH: Strange place for a thief to leave a key, don't you think?
KATE: ( quick memory ) He always did that.
SETH: He sure took off in a hurry. What scares a professional thief like
KATE: ( fighting tears ) . but he wasn't at those ( pointing to the . college graduation; law school graduation; the night Mom and I celebrated when I got a job; and me alone on the steps? I'd just won my first case, I was so ( still fighting ) . I used to think. sometimes I'd come home and I'd sense he'd been in my apartment, checking the fridge, shaking his head because he never thought I ate right. It's crazy but I just knew Daddy was watching over me.
SETH: You can do a good thing, Kate help me bring him in. Just leave a message on his phone machine, you're worried about him.
KATE: . No.
SETH: It's the truth you are worried about him this isn't your normal case his life may be in danger you can save him, make the call
KATE: . He won't come.
SETH: ( indicating the Of course he'll come. You're all he has.
SETH: ( moving in ) Kate, he's on the run and he's scared and he's right to be scared because he's going to get caught you don't know the heat on this.
KATE: He's not a murderer.
SETH: Maybe you're right. Maybe he is innocent. If so I'll have him home and dry in a few hours. But what happens if some hotshot who's trying to make a reputation tracks him down? I can guarantee his safety. You make the call, I make a promise: You'll have your father, home and
KATE: I left a message on his machine, he called back within an hour; we're meeting tomorrow afternoon.
SETH: KATE ( V.O. )
LATE AFTERNOON: taking it down.
LUTHER: I need to look really good today.
SALESMAN: ( as Luther tries It's a woman, I can tell. ( as Luther nods ) Never too late, is it?
LUTHER: You got that right.
BURTON: The Boss is very grateful. Figured he'd like an eyewitness report of the capture. This is our guy if he's innocent, he sure took off awful fast.
SETH: Figured he'd like an eyewitness report of the capture. This is our guy if he's innocent, he sure took off awful fast.
SETH: ( mutters )
WAITER: ( as she spins What you want please?
KATE: Nothing, thank you.
WAITER: Got to.
KATE: ( gesturing ) You sit you eat please.
WAITER: ( gesturing ) You sit you eat please.
SETH: This is not part of my brilliant master plan.
BURTON: They both crunch away.
KATE: ( gesturing around ) I'm waiting for someone.
WAITER: He must eat too, please.
KATE: Oh he will, we both will we'll order half the menu but just not now
WAITER: Cheesecake gone.
KATE: Thank you so much.
DAY: Collin. He holds a very high-powered weapon. It looks like it could kill from a thousand yards away. Where he is and it's not a thousand yards away he's in an unmarked van on the street, even closer than Collin, loading his weapon. His movements are skilled. His concentration is total.
LUTHER: I did not kill that woman, Kate.
KATE: ( glancing around ) I like that in a woman.
SETH: I like that in a woman.
SETH: Top number's local police other two are my office and I live alone, too, call anytime. Want me to get someone to spend the night?
KATE: I just need some sleep.
SETH: I've got surveillance outside. And I'm keeping it on 'til this is over. I've got a feeling he's going to try and contact you.
KATE: You're on a hot streak, I guess.
SETH: Listen, I'm sorry.
SETH: Anything unusual, call me right away not a bother, I live You said.
KATE: You said.
SETH: ( he knows that ) Feeble, huh?
KATE: Anything for the road? I've got water and water.
SETH: 278 INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT 278
SETH: Pelligrino would be great. What's funny, I say it wrong?
KATE: Tired is all.
SETH: I don't think I've told you this, but I live alone. Lock it behind me.
KATE: ( LOCKING it loudly ) How's that?
KATE: ( still facing door, I betrayed you, Luther. You better know that now.
KATE: Why'd you come?
LUTHER: You have to know I'm not a No, this afternoon. To the restaurant. Why'd you come then? You must have suspected something, or you wouldn't have been My daughter wanted to see me.
KATE: No, this afternoon. To the restaurant. Why'd you come then? You must have suspected something, or you wouldn't have been My daughter wanted to see me.
LUTHER: ( simply ) My daughter wanted to see me.
LUTHER: The robbery went fine 'til they came in. They were drunk. I hid in the vault. Sex got rough. He was going to kill Christy, but she turned the tables, was going to kill him. Two guys came in, shot her dead.
KATE: The same two guys who tried for you this afternoon?
LUTHER: Probably only one of them. I think Walter Sullivan might have hired the other.
KATE: Pretty powerful enemy; good going.
LUTHER: Not as powerful as the President of the United States.
LUTHER: Richmond was drunk. The two guys are Secret Service. Chief of Staff Russell planned the coverup.
LUTHER: Every word true.
KATE: You're saying you're innocent of the murder? Why in the world should I believe you?
LUTHER: Because I swear on Mattie's grave.
KATE: Luther, going to her.
LUTHER: On your mother's grave, Kate you know I'd kill myself before I'd lie about that. Jesus, Luther.
KATE: ( soft ) Jesus, Luther.
LUTHER: I know.
KATE: They'll kill you.
LUTHER: I know.
KATE: Can you run?
LUTHER: I was set to. At the airport. All the money I'd ever need.
LUTHER: But I saw that bastard using Sullivan on the T.V. maybe I couldn't have saved that woman, Kate. But I didn't even try. I know what you think of me and I know what we've been to each haven't been to each other. And it's not the time to try and explain my life
KATE: watching his face now.
LUTHER: but I've never robbed anyone couldn't afford it and I've never stiffed a waitress. And Alan Richmond has to pay.
KATE: What can you do?
LUTHER: Not much, maybe but I only went to jail when I had partners. People betray each other, Kate nowadays, when there's a group, someone wants to write a book
LUTHER: This is probably it; you understand that. I was never going to tell you this, but I watched you argue a case last year thank God you got your brains from your mother.
KATE: It's dangerous outside.
LUTHER: It always is and I may not make you proud, but I'm not going down alone.

RICHMOND: ( cutting in ) I sent a note?
RUSSELL: Yes, yes, you think I don't know your writing? I assumed you wanted me to wear it tonight.
RICHMOND: It is lovely, Gloria and you know what else?
RUSSELL: What, Alan?
RICHMOND: Christy Sullivan wore it the night she was killed.
RICHMOND: You realize what this means? Whitney's been heard from.
RUSSELL: It's not precisely the first time, Mr. President.
RICHMOND: ( so happy ) You've been keeping things from Only because you have so much on your plate, Alan; we wanted to spare you. ( beat ) He sent me a Polaroid of the letter opener yesterday.

BURTON: You're sure you want to do that?
RICHMOND: ( nods ) She's a young prosecutor, prosecutors ask questions she might know what he knows. ( a reassuring smile ) Let's get cracking, shall we? ( beat ) Show you love your country.
