NARRATOR: In his last adventure, Austin Powers, a swinging spy from the Sixties, was unfrozen in the Nineties to battle his archenemy Dr. Evil. Austin foiled Dr. Evil's plan to send a nuclear warhead to the center of the earth and banished him into space forever. Or so he thought.
VANESSA: I love you, Mr. Powers.
AUSTIN: And I love you, Mrs. Powers.
VANESSA: Let's go out on the terrace. It's a beautiful night, we can look at the
AUSTIN: Look how beautiful the night sky is.
VANESSA: Isn't that the big dipper?
AUSTIN: Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus.
VANESSA: ( sheepish ) Well, you know.
AUSTIN: ( sheepish ) Well, you know.
VANESSA: Hey, I've never seen that big star Yeah, what is that?
AUSTIN: Yeah, what is that?
DR. EVIL: This isn't over yet, Mr. Powers. I have one more trick up my sleeve, don't I Mr. Bigglesworth?
AUSTIN: Oh well, I guess it was nothing.
AUSTIN: Care for some champagne? Here's to monotony I mean, monogamy!
AUSTIN: Hello? Vanessa? What are you doing, Just putting on my
VANESSA: ( back turned ) Just putting on my
FEMBOT VANESSA: ( computer voice )
AUSTIN: ( frightened ) Vanessa, you're a Fembot!
AUSTIN: Machine gun jubblies, how did I miss
VANESSA: ( robot voice )
AUSTIN: ( very sad ) I can't believe Vanessa, my bride, my one true love, the woman who taught me the beauty of sharing your whole life with another, the person who taught me the meaning of love, was a Fembot. How will I ever go on? ( beat ) Wait a tic! That means I'm single! Oh, behave!
AUSTIN: Yeah, baby, I'm free! I'm naked and

AUSTIN: Shaguar, baby, yeah!
BOBBY: Dad, I know you're against race mixing and all that, but I met someone.
KLANSMAN: Don't say it!
BOBBY: I met someone. and he's black.
KLANSMAN: The Klansman holds his hooded head in his hands.
JERRY SPRINGER: Please welcome Tim.
JERRY SPRINGER: Now Scott, tell us about your father. Share with us.
SCOTT: Well he's the head of an evil organization that has aspirations for world domination.
JERRY SPRINGER: And where is your father right now?
SCOTT: He's in outer space, like frozen in a giant egg and stuffed inside a Big Boy rocket with his cat, Mr. Really? Well, we have a surprise for you, Scott. Let's bring out
JERRY SPRINGER: Really? Well, we have a surprise for you, Scott. Let's bring out
SCOTT'S: father, Dr Evil.
DR. EVIL: Hello Scott, I'm back.
SCOTT: I can't believe you'd do this to me on national television!
DR. EVIL: They offered me a free makeover.
JERRY SPRINGER: Dr. Evil, we've seen a lot of the fathers here today open up to their sons, sons to the fathers. Is there anything you'd like to share?
DR. EVIL: JERRY SPRINGER
JERRY SPRINGER: Yes, don't you have any secrets?
DR. EVIL: OK. I have a vestigial tail.
DR. EVIL: It's more of a nub, really. The spine just goes on a little longer than it should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean, perform fellatio once and you're a poet, twice and you're a homosexual. I remember once I was being fisted by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where the story gets interesting. He was lactose-intolerant. He could eat red meat all night long, but one sip of milk and it was gastric hell. And I remember we were caught in fragrance delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you can imagine my humiliation at having Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no teeth." One of my greatest disappointments is that I never became a song and dance man. I could have been a quadruple threat, kind of like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, singer, actor, and I would possess nuclear weapons, the latter being the most threatening of the four. I once sat on a bus and tried to will myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended up with was a sense of failure and a mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth and perhaps a grudging respect for the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. For the most part I distrust dogs. I slept in a horse once. It was quite roomy. On second thought, it was the Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss' and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy of The Fonze while I was in coma after smoking some Peruvian prayer hash, but who at the end of the day can honestly say they haven't done What are you, some kind of freak?
KLANSMAN: What are you, some kind of freak?
SCOTT: Shut up, jagoff!
KLANSMAN: I'll kick your ass punk!
DR. EVIL: No one talks to my boy that way!
DR. EVIL: I'm OK, I'm OK.
DR. EVIL: Come Scott, let's go to daddy's new evil lair.
NUMBER TWO: Dr. Evil, as the legitimate frontman of your organization, I seized upon the opportunity to invest in a small Seattle-based coffee company several years ago. Today, Starbucks is a far- flung empire with 2000 outlets Oh good, Number Two, I do enjoy a good cuppa joe.
DR. EVIL: Oh good, Number Two, I do enjoy a good cuppa joe.
NUMBER TWO: If I may continue, I believe if we shift our resources away from world domination and focus on providing premium quality coffee drinks, we can increase our gross profits
DR. EVIL: Right. Perhaps you've confused me with someone who gives a shit. Might I remind you that I run the show here? I demand a little respect.
NUMBER TWO: ( indicating Dr. Evil's milk mustache ) Dr. Evil, I think you
DR. EVIL: Silence! I will not tolerate your insolence! Remember what happened last time.
NUMBER TWO: May I add, I appreciate you reinstating me after our little. Frau Farbissina. Wie gehts is einen?
DR. EVIL: Frau Farbissina. Wie gehts is einen?
FRAU: Zehr gut, Herr Doctor.
DR. EVIL: How are things?
FRAU: I have come to embrace the love that dare not speak it's name. To my right is my lover. Her name is Unibrau. I met her on the LPGA Tour.
FRAU: Her name is Unibrau. I met her on the LPGA Tour.
DR. EVIL: Right on. Welcome, Unibrau.
FRAU: Doctor, you have a 'milk mustache.'
DR. EVIL: ( wiping it off, embarrassed ) Oh, I know. I know.
NUMBER TWO: Dr. Evil, I'd like to introduce the Greek assassin, Oedipus.
DR. EVIL: Welcome to my private army, Oedipus. I could give a shit.
OEDIPUS: I could give a shit.
DR. EVIL: Kiss your mother with that mouth?
OEDIPUS: DR. EVIL
DR. EVIL: Of course you do.
NUMBER TWO: ( clearing throat ) Dr. Evil, as you know, the rate at which you liquidate henchmen far exceeds our ability to replace them.
DR. EVIL: I have so few pleasures left to me, Number Two. The key to life is to rotate your vices. One day it's executions, another day it's creamy French cheese. It's like frickin' Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the answer. While you were frozen, we began a program to clone you.
NUMBER TWO: Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the answer. While you were frozen, we began a program to clone you.
DR. EVIL: NUMBER TWO
NUMBER TWO: We had a few glitches, but I think you'll be pleased with the results.
FRAU: ( shouting ) Send in the clone! He is identical to you in every way, except he is one-eighth your size.
NUMBER TWO: He is identical to you in every way, except he is one-eighth your size.
DR. EVIL: Breathtaking. I shall call him Mini- Mini-Me, you will sit to my right. Come Mr. Bigglesworth! Mini-me, something to eat?
DR. EVIL: Come Mr. Bigglesworth! Mini-me, something to eat?
DR. EVIL: Mini-me, something to eat?
DR. EVIL: With a White House intern!
NUMBER TWO: ( clearing his throat ) What, that already happened?
DR. EVIL: What, that already happened?
DR. EVIL: This is ri-goddamn-diculous. Oh well, how about a frickin' time machine? Does the president have a time machine? Have I been scooped on that?
NUMBER TWO: No, not that I'm aware of.
DR. EVIL: Alright, time machine it is. As you know, every diabolical scheme I've hatched has been thwarted by Austin Powers. And why is that, ladies and Because you never kill him when you get the chance and you're a dope?
SCOTT: Because you never kill him when you get the chance and you're a dope?
DR. EVIL: No, because Austin Powers has "mojo".
NUMBER TWO: Yes, mojo. The mojo is the life force, the essence, the libido, the "right It's what the French call a certain 'I don't know what.'
FRAU: Yes, mojo. The mojo is the life force, the essence, the libido, the "right It's what the French call a certain 'I don't know what.'
DR. EVIL: It's what the French call a certain 'I don't know what.'
SCOTT: If you've got a time machine, why don't you just go back and kill Austin Powers when he's a baby or something?
DR. EVIL: No, no, no.
NUMBER TWO: ( interrupting ) Dr. Evil, wouldn't it be easier to use your knowledge of the future to play the stock market? We could literally make trillions.
DR. EVIL: ( smug laugh to himself ) Why make trillions when we could ( pause ) Excuse me?
NUMBER TWO: Excuse me?
DR. EVIL: Why think small is all I'm saying.
SCOTT: A trillion is more than a billion, Zip it. Unveil the time portal!
DR. EVIL: Zip it. Unveil the time portal!
DR. EVIL: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the time portal. As you know, Austin Powers was frozen in 1967. Therefore, I time travel to 1969, two years after he was frozen. Security will be lax and I'll strike when he is totally helpless.
SCOTT: Can I come?
DR. EVIL: No, Scott, Daddy has a score to settle. Austin Powers is the snake to my mongoose, or the mongoose to my snake. Either way it's bad, I don't know animals. But I do know this: This time it's personal. Frau, Number 2, I'll see you both in 1969. Come, Mini-Me.
DR. EVIL: Ah, here we are Mini-Me, 1969. Number Two, you look very youthful and And Frau you look.right.
DR. EVIL: OK, people, we now officially have a chair problem. If another one of these chairs hits me in the nuts, I'm gonna go postal. Mini-Me, I want you to meet Number Two.
NUMBER TWO: Hello there.
DR. EVIL: Mini-me still says nothing.
DR. EVIL: Shy. Low blood sugar. Gentlemen, Phase Two is beginning. I have an operative inside the Ministry of Defense. By this time tomorrow, Austin Powers' mojo will be mine.
DR. EVIL: ( maniacal laugh ) Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!
BRITISH COLONEL: We've had reports that there's a spy in the Ministry of Defense. The contents of this room are vital to the country. Be on special alert.
FAT SOLDIER: ( thick Scottish accent ) Those bastards will have to kill me before I let anything happen to this wee naked hairy popsicle, sir!

BASIL EXPOSITION: Where is he? In here?
BASIL EXPOSITION: Austin, I came as soon as I heard.
AUSTIN: There must be some kind of mistake, Basil. Maybe I was drunk and I didn't know it.
BASIL EXPOSITION: What's wrong with your neck, Austin?
AUSTIN: ( turning stiffly to face Basil ) I took a Viagra and it got caught in my throat. I've had a stiff neck for hours. Basil, is it true? Have I lost my mojo?
BASIL EXPOSITION: We're going to run a few tests, Austin. Don't worry, old friend, we'll get to the bottom of this.
NURSE: Excuse me, Mr. Powers, I need to give you a sponge bath before we begin the test.
AUSTIN: ( not paying attention to her ) Alright, miss, just let me finish this article on the Suez crisis.
AUSTIN: What's going on?
BASIL EXPOSITION: Alright, everyone, we're done.
AUSTIN: But the test hasn't even started!
BASIL EXPOSITION: Agent Haggerty was the test, Austin. Not only were you actually reading an article in that Playboy, but a candy-stripe nurse offering to give you a sponge bath didn't so much as turn your head.
AUSTIN: Wait, I can explain, man! I was going to shag her but the article was so I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's true: you've lost your mojo.
BASIL EXPOSITION: I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's true: you've lost your mojo.

BASIL EXPOSITION: We have evidence that Dr. Evil has developed a time machine.

AUSTIN: Got it. I almost gipped.
AUSTIN: But Basil, isn't that the new Volkswagen Beetle?
BASIL EXPOSITION: That's what they'd like you to So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 and I was frozen in 1967, I could go look at my frozen self. But, if I'm still frozen in 1967, how could I have been unthawed in the 90's and traveled back to the Sixties? Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed.
AUSTIN: So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 and I was frozen in 1967, I could go look at my frozen self. But, if I'm still frozen in 1967, how could I have been unthawed in the 90's and traveled back to the Sixties? Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed.
BASIL EXPOSITION: ( to camera ) I suggest you don't worry about those things and just enjoy yourself.
AUSTIN: This is smashing Basil. I'll go back to the Sixties, recharge my mojo, defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time for tea.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Good luck, Austin.
AUSTIN: Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil.

AUSTIN: That's my Beetle, baby.
FELICITY: It was your Beetle. Get in.
FELICITY: Austin Powers, I presume?
AUSTIN: Powers by name, Powers by reputation.
FELICITY: Felicity Shagwell, CIA. Shagwell by name, Shag-very-Well by reputation.
AUSTIN: ( turning to camera ) Crazy, baby!
FELICITY: Grab the wheel, would you?
ASSASSIN: EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN Same shot as the car: The assassin's body goes over and tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three times before it, too,
FELICITY: Well, Austin, I think this time you may have met your match.
AUSTIN: Oh, I've beaten Dr. Evil before, and I'll beat him again.
FELICITY: I was talking about me.
AUSTIN: Welcome to my shag pad, baby.
AUSTIN: Care for something to drink? Or perhaps something to read?
AUSTIN: Or perhaps something to read?
AUSTIN: How about a hot cup of coffee?
FELICITY: Yes, I rather fancy a grind.
AUSTIN: Oh, Behave!
AUSTIN: Would you like a. mas-sage? A sensssual mas-sage?
AUSTIN: How does that feel, baby?
FELICITY: Mmm, lower.
AUSTIN: ( lowering his voice )
FELICITY: Wait, something's itching me.
FELICITY: That's better.
AUSTIN: Austin GULPS and accidentally spurts way too much oil on Austin continues the back rub and Felicity stretches out on the bed.
AUSTIN: Austin continues the back rub and Felicity stretches out on the bed.
AUSTIN: ( talking to his crotch ) Hello, anyone home? C'mon lads, do it for England.
FELICITY: Oh, that was so relaxing. Felicity stretches very sexily.
AUSTIN: Would you 'like to see my etchings?
FELICITY: ( sexy ) I think I'm ready for bed.
AUSTIN: I'll get you some PJs.
FELICITY: No, I'm ready for bed.
AUSTIN: Oh, you'll want to clean your teeth
FELICITY: No, I want to have sex with you, Hello Vicar!
AUSTIN: Hello Vicar!
FELICITY: I've studied everything about you- your methods, your accomplishments, your preferences. You're the reason I became a spy. Now, I've waited two years to meet you, so I say we get busy making up for lost time.
AUSTIN: ( reflective ) Felicity, I used to think that way, too, but I guess. I guess I've changed. Not to make a short story long, or to ramble on and on, or to keep talking in a repetitive manner ad infinitum until it becomes impossible to remember what I was talking about in the first place, but- where was I?
AUSTIN: Oh yes. Felicity, I can't shag you. I've lost my mojo.
FELICITY: ( obviously disappointed ) I thought coming back to the Sixties would bring it back, but it hasn't.
AUSTIN: I thought coming back to the Sixties would bring it back, but it hasn't.
FELICITY: Austin, don't worry. I know just the man to help you. He's my guru. Ringo recommended him and he's the best.
AUSTIN: I'll warm up the Jumbo Jet, baby!
FELICITY: There he is. That's my guru.
FELICITY: Guru, I'd like you to meet Austin How are you baby?
AUSTIN: How are you baby?
GURU PITKA: My chakras are aligned and I am in a perfect state of equipoise.
AUSTIN: Good on ya. I don't know what that means but it sounds fab.
FELICITY: Guru, we need some advice.
GURU PITKA: Hold your horses and any other beasts- of burden. I must lead my disciples in meditation and then I will help
DISCIPLES: GURU PITKA
GURU PITKA: My name is the Guru Pitka. I am a spiritual teacher and I have combined many disparate disciplines into a unified movement of human potentiality and equipoise that I learned from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who died mysteriously of a disease that strangely had all the hallmarks of syphilis. He would say to me, Sparky, love is all, life is breath.
DISCIPLES: GURU PITKA
GURU PITKA: Now, perhaps you are wondering where I got the nickname Sparky. Well, when we were young we used to play a game called "Stinkmop". We would urinate into a bucket, dip a mop into it, and play tag. I did not care for "Stinkmop" and a very wise old man said to me 'oh lighten up, Sparky', and I don't know, the name kind of stuck.
DISCIPLES: GURU PITKA
GURU PITKA: Now, the reason I am a spiritualist instead of a therapist is that 'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' and that will not help us attain potentiality. Now what is potentiality? It is the ability to achieve those goals that we wish to achieve for ourselves. People often say to me that they feel "nowhere", and I am going to change that to "Now here."
DISCIPLES: GURU PITKA
GURU PITKA: And you have many assumptions about your goals, but when you "assume" You make an "ass" out of "u" and
DISCIPLES: GURU PITKA
GURU PITKA: The being, or that which we call 'ourselves', is not the tinker. It is not the taughts. It is the Gap between the tinker and the taughts! We are not our mind, we are not our body, we are the Gap!
DISCIPLES: GURU PITKA ( rapid fire )
GURU PITKA: ( rapid fire ) The heart of the matter is that you are the heart of the matter. There is no "I" in "team". Beer before liquor, never sicker. Don't take a wooden nickel. If your pipe is short and your pump is weak, you better stand close or you'll piss on your feet. He who goes to bed with itchy bum wakes up with smelly finger.
DISCIPLES: GURU PITKA
GURU PITKA: Finally, the path to spiritual awakening requires the death of ego. Leggo of my ego! Let us end with the mantra: Om Ay Vant Yu Uh. Mo Ay Vant Yu Uh. Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.
DISCIPLES: ( chanting ) Om Ay Vant Yu Uh. Mo Ay Vant Yu Uh. Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.
GURU PITKA: Go with God, and pay at the door
GURU PITKA: How can I help you?
AUSTIN: Guru, I'm having trouble performing.
GURU PITKA: What do you mean?
AUSTIN: You know- my bits and pieces are a bit sleepy.
GURU PITKA: I'm not understanding.
AUSTIN: I've forgotten the steps to the Mummy- Daddy dance.
GURU PITKA: Still not clear.
AUSTIN: My flag's at half mast and no one will salute it.
GURU PITKA: My Willie don't work.
AUSTIN: My Willie don't work.
GURU PITKA: Why are you beating around the bush?
AUSTIN: That's my problem.
GURU PITKA: Ohhhhh, I get it. No, I don't get it.
FELICITY: He's impotent!
AUSTIN: Alright, easy. Felicity and I were all set for some hump Olympics and I couldn't bat for Oh, yes, I see.
GURU PITKA: Oh, yes, I see.
AUSTIN: You have no idea what I'm saying, do Not a word.
GURU PITKA: Not a word.
AUSTIN: Guru, I've lost my mojo.
GURU PITKA: Oh, mojo! You should have said so. Well, you've lost your mojo because your chakras are misaligned. You have lost love.
AUSTIN: Lost love? Oh, you mean Vanessa?
FELICITY: Who's Vanessa?
AUSTIN: She was an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil. I couldn't have loved her.
GURU PITKA: Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, buddy. You will only get your mojo back when you surround yourself with Oh, I get what you're saying now! He's talking about free love, baby! Tune in, turn on, and drop out!
AUSTIN: Oh, I get what you're saying now! He's talking about free love, baby! Tune in, turn on, and drop out!
GURU PITKA: I am talking about true love. You must stay and study until you are No way, man. The only way to surround yourself with love is to throw a swinging shin-dig! Yeah, baby, yeah!
AUSTIN: No way, man. The only way to surround yourself with love is to throw a swinging shin-dig! Yeah, baby, yeah!
DR. EVIL: Well done, Fat Bastard. May I have the mojo?

FAT BASTARD: I've got a lot of demons kickin' around in my noggin, but weight issues ain't one of them.
DR. EVIL: Alright, Fatty-
FAT BASTARD: The name is Fat Bastard! I'm the incorrect weight for my height and I was born out of wedlock, hence the moniker Fat Bastard. Hey, I'm not kiddin'. I've got a crap on deck that could choke a donkey.
DR. EVIL: Fat Bastard, the mojo?
FAT BASTARD: Where's my ( bleeping ) money?

SCOTT: I don't know, I was sitting around watching the tube and The Courtship of Eddie's Father came on Nick at Nite, you know, and I was just listening to that theme song Anyway it made me think that maybe we could try and work things out. You know, you are my Dad and I need You had your chance, Scott. I already have someone created in my image.

FELICITY: Sounds awful.
AUSTIN: It's not so bad once you get used to it. The Nineties are about responsibility. You know, having respect for yourself and other people. I even got married.
FELICITY: You? Married? What about the sexual Well, it turns out there were some casualties, baby. Don't you think you'll ever get married?

AUSTIN: Felicity, I haven't had this much fun since I worked undercover in Amsterdam '66 I think it was.
FELICITY: 1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch cheese expert to stop Dr. Evil from poisoning the world's water supply.
FELICITY: I've studied your file, Austin. I want to be a trailblazer, just like you. The Seventies are right around the corner. It's going to be a glorious time for fashion and music and technology it won't be long before every flying car has its own

BASIL EXPOSITION: Hello, Austin. What's wrong with your voice?
AUSTIN: ( still phlegmy throat ) I just had ice cream. Listen to me, I have dairy throat. "Mary had a little lamb and it was always gruntin'. She tied it to a five bar gate and kicked it's little-
BASIL EXPOSITION: ( Interrupting ) Austin! Things are heating up, so I thought it best to contact you in disguise. Felicity, your plan worked. You and Austin track Fat Bastard back to Dr. Evil.
AUSTIN: But how can we track Fat Bastard?
FELICITY: I planted a homing device on him last night.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Yes, and we're starting to pick up the signal now.
AUSTIN: How did you get close enough to plant a homing device?
FELICITY: I shagged him, I shagged him rotten. You. him? Just like that?

BASIL EXPOSITION: Well, thanks to your effort, Felicity, we now know that-
AUSTIN: ( interrupting, to Felicity ) Did you use an elaborate set of pulleys? A block and tackle?
BASIL EXPOSITION: Anyway, you two follow the signal back to Dr. Evil's headquarters and I just can't get my head around it, baby. You're so small and he's so . not small. The sheer mechanics of it are mindboggling!
AUSTIN: ( interrupting, to Felicity ) I just can't get my head around it, baby. You're so small and he's so . not small. The sheer mechanics of it are mindboggling!
BASIL EXPOSITION: Never mind, Austin, you two have work to do. You must find Dr. Evil.

FELICITY: Austin, it almost sounds like you're Who, me? That's not possible, baby! is it?
AUSTIN: Who, me? That's not possible, baby! is it?
AUSTIN: Get down!
FELICITY: We're obviously on the right track. It looks like Fat Bastard is-on an island in the middle of the ocean.
AUSTIN: According to the readings, Dr. Evil's headquarters is over the next ridge.
FELICITY: Can I have a look?
AUSTIN: Austin hands her the binoculars. Unfortunately the strap is still around his neck, pulling his face into her cleavage.
FELICITY: Question is, how do we get in?
AUSTIN: ( muffled ) Austin, did you hear me?
FELICITY: Austin, did you hear me?
AUSTIN: I seem to be stuck in your dirty Where are the topographical maps that Basil drew up?
FELICITY: Where are the topographical maps that Basil drew up?

DR. EVIL: ( singing )
NUMBER TWO: Dr. Evil, that was fantastic, but I do have some bad news. Powers' is on the island.
DR. EVIL: How tedious.

DR. EVIL: NUMBER TWO
NUMBER TWO: I have the perfect weapon. Frau?
FRAU: ( shouting ) Bring in the He-Bots! Dr. Evil, may I present the He-Bots. What kind of woman could resist these perfect specimens of masculinity? Their clothes are stylish, their posture is ramrod straight, and their buttocks are tight, like tigers. And, each He-Bot is armed with a secret weapon.
NUMBER TWO: Dr. Evil, may I present the He-Bots. What kind of woman could resist these perfect specimens of masculinity? Their clothes are stylish, their posture is ramrod straight, and their buttocks are tight, like tigers. And, each He-Bot is armed with a secret weapon.
DR. EVIL: Right. I object to the last one on aesthetic grounds, but I don't care how you get Powers, just bring him to me. Ready Mini-Me? A one and a two and.
BLUE!: EXT. TENT We see the shadows again. It now looks like Felicity is putting things into Austin's ass.

FAT BASTARD: Great, now it smells like someone took a shite in a pine tree.
NUMBER TWO: Dr. Evil, the laser has been loaded into the rocket. You're ready for I'm just waiting to taunt my nemesis. I have so few pleasures, you know.
DR. EVIL: I'm just waiting to taunt my nemesis. I have so few pleasures, you know.
DR. EVIL: Ah, Mr. Powers, Ms. Shagwell, welcome to my hollowed-out volcano.
AUSTIN: We meet again, Dr. Evil.
DR. EVIL: Yes, the only reason I'm keeping you alive is so you can feel the agony of watching my plan unfold.
AUSTIN: Dr. Evil your plan will never

FELICITY: Now you've got a couple of achers.
DR. EVIL: Oww! My stomach hurts!
AUSTIN: ( wincing ) I don't care if he is evil, you don't give a man a shot in the pills. It's just not cricket, baby.
DR. EVIL: Take them away.
SCOTT: She just hoofed you in the sack and you're going to leave them alone in a jail cell with one inept guard? They'll escape, dipshit. You do this every time!
DR. EVIL: You're going the right way for a smacked bottom, young man.
SCOTT: You don't own me!
DR. EVIL: I do actually. It's complicated. Usually it's illegal but this buddy of mine. but I digress. Fat Bastard, I'm leaving you in charge. I'm going up the moon to hold the world ransom with my giant laser, I shouldn't be long.
FAT BASTARD: What about Powers?
DR. EVIL: He's tucked away safely in his cell. He's harmless without that mojo. Guard it with your life. Number Two, begin the countdown.
NUMBER TWO: Five, four, three.

AUSTIN: Why don't you just shag Fat Bastard Austin, that is it! I don't know what happened to you in the Nineties, but I'm still here, in the Sixties, and I still swing! Don't try to lay your hang-ups on me just because you lost your mojo! That one hurts.
FELICITY: ( exploding ) Austin, that is it! I don't know what happened to you in the Nineties, but I'm still here, in the Sixties, and I still swing! Don't try to lay your hang-ups on me just because you lost your mojo! That one hurts.
AUSTIN: Ouch, baby, very ouch. I'm wounded.
FELICITY: I'm sorry, Austin, that was a cheap No, baby, you're right. I was wrong to judge you. I guess I am. jealous.
AUSTIN: No, baby, you're right. I was wrong to judge you. I guess I am. jealous.
FELICITY: But the Austin Powers I knew was wild and crazy and free. He could never be jealous.
AUSTIN: That Austin is gone. I've changed. I knew someone, not long ago, a very special woman. She taught me that life isn't about jumping into the sack with whoever comes along, it's about caring and responsibility. And while it is true she turned out to be an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil, I suppose I really did. love her.
FELICITY: Was that your wife?
AUSTIN: Yes, Vanessa.
FELICITY: Listen, Austin, I can't pretend to understand everything you've gone through, but I trust you. I'll make you a deal: if we get out of here alive, I'll give monogamy a try.
AUSTIN: With me?
FELICITY: Yes, silly.
AUSTIN: Groovy, baby!
FELICITY: We need to lure the guard inside and get his key.
AUSTIN: Alright, what if I pretend to be desperately ill with food poisoning? The guard, drawn by my cries of pain, will come to investigate. Meanwhile, you dig a pit and line it with makeshift punji sticks made from sharpened toothbrushes. The guard falls in, Bob's your uncle, and we've got the key. What do you think?
FELICITY: That might work, but how about this?
FELICITY: ( giving a wolf whistle ) What do you think of these, my man?
GUARD: He unlocks the door and enters.
FELICITY: ( seductive, to guard ) It's very hot in here, don't you
FELICITY: ( irritated ) It's very hot in here, don't you
FELICITY: ( breaking cover ) ( from above ) I'm very firmly wedged.
AUSTIN: ( from above ) I'm very firmly wedged.
FELICITY: If you want something done.
AUSTIN: Almost. got it!
AUSTIN: Let's go get my mojo!
DR. EVIL: Has anyone seen my gravity booties? Honestly, all I wanted was a frickin' moon base. Hello, we're on the moon, no gravity? Mini-Me? Are you alright?

AUSTIN: Give me back my mojo, Fat Bastard!
FAT BASTARD: I give the orders, ( bleep ) for brains. Guards, take them back to their cells.
FELICITY: Hold on, let me ask you one question.
FAT BASTARD: Alright, I guess I owe you that much for a night of carnal ecstasy.
FELICITY: Are you happy?
FAT BASTARD: What kind of stupid ass question is that? I'm ( bleep )in' rich and I'm up to my tits in clean stinky.
FELICITY: You didn't answer my question, are you happy?
FAT BASTARD: It's about my girth isn't it? Sure I could lose a few pounds, but I could shiva git!
FELICITY: Are you happy?
FAT BASTARD: Of course I'm not happy. Look at me, I'm a big fat slob. I've got bigger titties than you do! I've got more ( bleep )in' chins than a Chinese phone book. I've got more crack cheese than a ( bleep )in' dairy. I've nay seen ma willie in two years. That's enough time to declare it legally deed! I can't stop eating.

AUSTIN: Maybe inside that Fat Bastard there's a thin bastard, trying to get out
FAT BASTARD: Maybe there's big crap inside me trying to get out, jack-ass! Enough of your ( bleep )in' new age aphorisms. Listen, I've run the gamut of self- help books. "Food isn't love", right, but how do you get it from the page to the ( bleep )in' fork? I'm so weak, I hate myself. I'm for shite. Here, take the mojo.
FAT BASTARD: I appreciate you trying to reach me, no one can do it for me, I know this now. There's a hole in my soul that food won't fill. This is the beginning of a new me. I'm gonna go to the gym everyday. If you'll excuse me, there's someone I have to get in touch with and forgive. myself. Sorry. I farted. It's a long road ahead.
AUSTIN: Hold on, I have something very important to do.
FELICITY: How do you feel?
AUSTIN: Sound as a pound, my spuds are boiling. Fancy a shag?
FELICITY: Austin, we don't have time.
AUSTIN: C'mon, luv, let's hop on the good foot and do the bad thing!
FELICITY: Dr. Evil's taken his laser to the moon. The world is in danger.
AUSTIN: Right, the moon. I think I know someone who can give us a lift.
AUSTIN: Gor blimey, you'd have to be a rocket scientist to figure this stuff out.
ASTRONAUT: I am a rocket scientist.
AUSTIN: Felicity, if you get frightened, just hold my hand.
FELICITY: ( yelling )
BASIL EXPOSITION: Austin, you have achieved lunar orbit. How was that lift-off?
AUSTIN: To be honest it was terrifying. It felt like sitting on top of a bomb. As I punched through the atmosphere, I said 'Oh my God!' and I soiled Happens all the time in that No, I mean I soiled myself just now when I said oh 'my God!'
BASIL EXPOSITION: Happens all the time in that No, I mean I soiled myself just now when I said oh 'my God!'
AUSTIN: No, I mean I soiled myself just now when I said oh 'my God!'
FELICITY: Basil, it was amazing!
BASIL EXPOSITION: Prepare for moon landing. We only have one hour until Dr. Evil fires the laser!
AUSTIN: This is one small step for man, but a giant step for shagging. Can you imagine it, baby, weightless? The permutations are mind-boggling.
FELICITY: Naughty boy!
AUSTIN: God Save the Queen.
MISSION COMMANDER: The Queen? This is an American show, goddammit. Let's roll that footage we shot last week in the studio.
DR. EVIL: Position the laser.
DR. EVIL: Get me the President.

PRESIDENT: DR. EVIL
DR. EVIL: The Capital will be destroyed-
PRESIDENT: Sorry! I just can't- I think it's that alarm.
DR. EVIL: Could someone shut off that frickin' alarm? I'm trying to hold the free world hostage here. Honestly.
DR. EVIL: ( shouting )
PRESIDENT: Please Dr. Evil, be reasonable. That's more money than is in the entire Federal Treasury!
DR. EVIL: Oh well, I guess you have one minute to- "show me the money"!
PRESIDENT: I still don't know what that means. I can't show you the money because we don't have the money.
DR. EVIL: Then I suppose you're up shit's crick without a paddle.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Gentlemen, Austin has landed on the moon. We'll soon know whether he has succeeded or whether the world will be destroyed!
FELICITY: Let's find Dr. Evil.
AUSTIN: He points. We see a profile through a sheet of frosted glass. It is Dr. Evil's distinctive profile, with a machine gun. Austin takes careful aim and FIRES. We see the SHADOW take the hit, and fall.

DR. EVIL: Aren't you forgetting something?
AUSTIN: ( to Dr. Evil ) What have you done to her?
DR. EVIL: Don't worry, she's not dead. yet.
FELICITY: ( muffled through glass ) Don't worry about me Austin. You've got to save the world!
DR. EVIL: It looks like you have a choice, Powers: save the world, or save your

AUSTIN: See, Dr. Evil I told you I could do Perhaps you spoke too soon.
DR. EVIL: Perhaps you spoke too soon.
AUSTIN: Austin BANGS on the glass with his fists.
AUSTIN: Felicity! Felicity. Wake up! Wake up! Please God, don't take her away.
AUSTIN: Felicity, you have to understand, I thought I had my mojo back. This isn't fair.
AUSTIN: I love you, Felicity! I know I couldn't say it before, but I really do love you! Dr. Evil, I'll kill him!
