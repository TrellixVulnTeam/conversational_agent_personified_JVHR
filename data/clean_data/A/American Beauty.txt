JANE: I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery.
JANE: ( deadpan ) Yeah, would you?
JIM #1: Hush, Bitsy. You hush. What is wrong?
JIM #2: ( re: barking dog ) What in the world is wrong with her? She had a walk this morning.
JIM #1: And a jerky treat.
JIM #2: You spoil her. Bitsy. No bark. Come inside. Now.
CAROLYN: Good morning, Jim!
JIM #1: Morning, Carolyn.
CAROLYN: ( overly friendly ) I just love your tie! That color!
JIM #1: I just love your roses. How do you get them to flourish like this?
CAROLYN: Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and Miracle Grow.
CAROLYN: Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look Well, congratulations. You've succeeded
JANE: Well, congratulations. You've succeeded
CAROLYN: Well, congratulations. You've succeeded
JANE: Nice going, Dad.
LESTER: Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please?. Well, we're all under a deadline here, uh, but you see, there is some basic information about the product launch that isn't even covered in your press release and I. Yeah. Can I ask you a question? Who is Tamblin? Does he exist? 'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in. Yeah, okay, I'll leave my
BRAD: Hey Les. You got a minute?
LESTER: For you, Brad? I've got five.
BRAD: I'm sure you can understand our need to cut corners around here.
LESTER: Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta free up cash. Gotta spend money to make money. Right?
BRAD: Exactly. So.
LESTER: ( blurts ) Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, like, three months?
BRAD: ( startled ) That's unsubstantiated gossip.
LESTER: That's fifty thousand dollars. That's somebody's salary. That's somebody who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him!
BRAD: Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired yet. That's why we're having everyone write out a job description, mapping out in detail how they contribute. That way, management can assess who's valuable and
LESTER: Who's expendable.
BRAD: It's just business.
LESTER: ( angry ) I've been writing for this magazine for fourteen years, Brad. You've been here how long, a whole month?
BRAD: ( frank ) I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying to level with you. This is your one chance to save your job.
CAROLYN: there is no decision, you just write the damn thing!
LESTER: You don't think it's weird and kinda Possibly. But you don't want to be Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan, because it's more convenient that way.
CAROLYN: Possibly. But you don't want to be Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan, because it's more convenient that way.
LESTER: Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan, because it's more convenient that way.
CAROLYN: Could you be just a little bit more dramatic, please, huh?
LESTER: Well, they were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore.
CAROLYN: Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial portion of the root structure was on our property. You know that. How can you call it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something if it wasn't partially mine, which of course it
JANE: Mom, do we always have to listen to this elevator music?
CAROLYN: ( considers ) No. No, we don't. As soon as you've prepared a nutritious yet savory meal that I'm about to eat, you can listen to whatever you like.
LESTER: So Janie, how was school?
JANE: ( suspicious ) It was okay.
LESTER: Just okay?
JANE: No, Dad. It was spec-tac-ular.
LESTER: Well, you want to know how things went at my job today?
JANE: ( uncomfortable ) Well, what do you expect? You can't all of a sudden be my best friend, just because you had a bad day.
LESTER: Oh, what, you're mother-of-the-year? You treat her like an employee.
CAROLYN: ( taken aback )
LESTER: I'm going to get some ice cream.
LESTER: Honey, I'm sorry. I.
JANE: Oh, great. So now it's my fault?
LESTER: I didn't say that. It's nobody's fault. Janie, what happened? You and I used to be pals.
CAROLYN: I will sell this house today.
CAROLYN: I will sell this house today.
CAROLYN: Welcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham!
CAROLYN: This living room is very dramatic. Wait 'til you see the native stone fireplace!
CAROLYN: It's a dream come true for any cook. Just filled with positive energy. Huh?
CAROLYN: .and you'll be surprised how much a ceiling fan can cut down on your energy
CAROLYN: You know, you could have some really fun backyard get-togethers out here.
WOMAN #1: The ad said this pool was "lagoon-like." There's nothing "lagoon-like" about it. Except for maybe the bugs.
WOMAN #2: There's not even any plants out here.
CAROLYN: ( re: shrub ) What do you call this? Is this not a plant? If you have a problem with the plants, I can always call my landscape architect. Solved.
WOMAN #2: I mean, I think "lagoon," I think waterfall, I think tropical. This is a cement hole.
CAROLYN: I have some tiki torches in the garage.
CAROLYN: Shut up. Stop it. You. Weak!
ANGELA: Who are you looking for?
JANE: My parents are coming tonight. They're trying to, you know, take an active interest in me.
ANGELA: Gross. I hate it when my mom does that.
JANE: They're such assholes. Why can't they just have their own lives?
LESTER: What makes you so sure she wants us to be there? Did she ask us to come?
CAROLYN: Of course not. She doesn't want us to know how important this is to her. But she's been practicing her steps for Well, I bet money she's going to resent it. And I'm missing the James Bond marathon on TNT.
LESTER: Well, I bet money she's going to resent it. And I'm missing the James Bond marathon on TNT.
CAROLYN: Lester, this is important. I'm sensing a real distance growing between you and Growing? She hates me.
LESTER: Growing? She hates me.
CAROLYN: She's just willful.
LESTER: She hates you too.
ANNOUNCER: ( over P.A. ) And now, for your half-time entertainment, Rockwell High's award- winning Dancing Spartanettes!
LESTER: We can leave right after this, right?
JANE: Oh shit, they're still here. Hi! I really enjoyed that! Congratulations, honey, you were great.
LESTER: Hi! I really enjoyed that! Congratulations, honey, you were great.
CAROLYN: Hi! I really enjoyed that! Congratulations, honey, you were great.
LESTER: Congratulations, honey, you were great.
JANE: I didn't win anything.
LESTER: ( to Angela ) Hi, I'm Lester. Janie's dad.
ANGELA: Oh. Hi.
JANE: This is my friend, Angela Hayes.
LESTER: Okay, good to meet you. You were also good tonight. Very. precise.
ANGELA: ( warming ) ( to Angela ) Nice to meet you, Angela. ( to Jane ) Honey, I'm so proud of you. I watched you very closely, and you didn't screw up ( then, to Lester ) Okay, we have to go.
CAROLYN: ( to Angela ) Nice to meet you, Angela. ( to Jane ) Honey, I'm so proud of you. I watched you very closely, and you didn't screw up ( then, to Lester ) Okay, we have to go.
LESTER: So, what are you girls doing now?
JANE: We're going out for pizza.
ANGELA: We're going out for pizza.
LESTER: Oh really, do you need a ride? We can give you a ride. I have a car. You wanna come with us?
ANGELA: Thanks. but I have a car.
LESTER: Oh, you have a car. Oh. That's great! That's great, because Janie's thinking about getting a car soon too, aren't you, Dad. Mom's waiting for you.
JANE: ( you freak ) Dad. Mom's waiting for you.
LESTER: Well, it was very nice meeting you, Angela. Any, uh, friend of Janie's is a friend of mine.
JANE: Could he be any more pathetic?
ANGELA: I think it's sweet. And I think he and your mother have not had sex in a long
LESTER: It's the weirdest thing.
JANE: I'm sorry my dad was so weird tonight.
ANGELA: It's okay. I'm used to guys drooling over me. It started when I was about twelve, I'd go out to dinner with my parents. Every Thursday night, Red Lobster. And every guy there would stare at me when I walked in. And I knew what they were thinking. Just like I knew guys at school thought about me when they jerked off.
JANE: No, I liked it. And I still like it. If people I don't even know look at me and want to fuck me, it means I really have a shot at being a model. Which is great, because there's nothing worse in life than being ordinary.
ANGELA: No, I liked it. And I still like it. If people I don't even know look at me and want to fuck me, it means I really have a shot at being a model. Which is great, because there's nothing worse in life than being ordinary.
JANE: I really think it'll happen for you.
ANGELA: Oh, I know. Because everything that was meant to happen, does. Eventually.
JANE: He looks back at her curiously, then raises his Digicam and starts to videotape her. His POV, on VIDEO: Jane, angry and self-conscious, turns and walks quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes.
ANGELA: ( over phone line ) Hello? Hello?
JANE: INT. HAYES HOUSE - ANGELA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS Angela is sprawled across her bed, on the phone.
ANGELA: Why'd you call me?
JANE: I didn't.
ANGELA: Well, my phone just rang and I answered it and somebody hung up and then I star sixty-nined and it called you back.
JANE: I was in the shower.
RICKY: Be right there.
RICKY: Startled, Barbara turns to him.
BARBARA: As she attempts to serve him bacon:
RICKY: I don't eat bacon, remember?
BARBARA: ( unnerved ) I'm sorry, I must have forgotten.
RICKY: What's new in the world, Dad?
COLONEL: This country is going straight to hell. Are you expecting anyone?
BARBARA: ( thinks )
JIM #1: JIM #2
JIM #2: Welcome to the neighborhood.
JIM #1: Just a little something from our garden.
JIM #2: Except for the pasta, we got that at It's unbelievably fresh. You just drop it in the water and it's done.
JIM #1: It's unbelievably fresh. You just drop it in the water and it's done.
COLONEL: ( shakes ) Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.
JIM #1: Nice to meet you. And this is my Jim Berkley, but people call me J.B.
JIM #2: ( offers his hand ) Jim Berkley, but people call me J.B.
COLONEL: Let's cut to the chase, okay? What are you guys selling?
JIM #2: ( after a beat ) Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors
COLONEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you said you're partners. So what's your business?
JIM #1: Well, he's a tax attorney.
JIM #2: And he's an anesthesiologist.
COLONEL: How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face? How can they be so That's the whole thing, Dad. They don't feel like it's anything to be ashamed of.
RICKY: That's the whole thing, Dad. They don't feel like it's anything to be ashamed of.
COLONEL: Well, it is.
RICKY: Yeah, you're right.
COLONEL: Don't placate me like I'm your mother,
RICKY: Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly, but those fags make me want to puke my fucking guts out.
COLONEL: Me too, son. Me too.
ANGELA: I'm serious, he just pulled down his pants and yanked it out. You know, like, say hello to Mr. Happy.
ANGELA: It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.
ANGELA: Of course I did. He is a really well- known photographer? He shoots for Elle on like, a regular basis? It would have been so majorly stupid of me to turn him down.
ANGELA: Hey. That's how things really are. You just don't know, because you're this pampered little suburban chick.
ANGELA: ( calling off ) ( then ) I am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me.
JANE: Oh my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night.
ANGELA: Him? Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic.
JANE: You know him?
ANGELA: Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift when I was in ninth grade, and he would always say the most random, weird things, and then one day, he was just like, gone. And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his parents had to put him in a mental Why? What did he do?
JANE: Why? What did he do?
ANGELA: What do you mean?
JANE: Well, they can't put you away just for saying weird things.
ANGELA: You total slut. You've got a crush on What? Please.
JANE: What? Please.
ANGELA: You were defending him! You love him. You want to have like, ten thousand of his Shut up.
JANE: Shut up.
RICKY: Hi. My name's Ricky. I just moved next door to you.
JANE: I know. I kinda remember this really creepy incident when you were filming me last night?
RICKY: I didn't mean to scare you. I just think you're interesting.
JANE: Thanks, but I really don't need to have some psycho obsessing about me right now.
RICKY: I'm not obsessing. I'm just curious.
ANGELA: What a freak. And why does he dress like a Bible salesman?
JANE: He's like, so confident. That can't be I don't believe him. I mean, he didn't even like, look at me once.
ANGELA: I don't believe him. I mean, he didn't even like, look at me once.
RICKY: He sits on the couch, next to his father, and watches TV along with them. The Colonel's smile fades.
BARBARA: ( out of the blue ) I'm sorry, what?
RICKY: Mom. Nobody said anything.
BARBARA: Oh. I'm sorry.
CAROLYN: everyone here is with their spouse or their significant other. How would it look if I showed up with no one?
LESTER: Well, you always end up ignoring me and going off Now listen to me. This is an important business function. As you know, my business is selling an image. And part of my job is to live that image
CAROLYN: Now listen to me. This is an important business function. As you know, my business is selling an image. And part of my job is to live that image
LESTER: Just say whatever you want to say and spare me the propaganda.
CAROLYN: ( spots someone ) Hi, Shirley! ( to Lester ) Listen, just do me a favor. Act happy ( grins stupidly ) I am happy, honey.
LESTER: ( grins stupidly ) I am happy, honey.
CAROLYN: ( spots someone ) Oh! Buddy!
BUDDY: It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
CAROLYN: Carolyn! Of course. How are you?
BUDDY: Carolyn! Of course. How are you?
CAROLYN: Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy.
CHRISTY: My husband, Lester
CAROLYN: My husband, Lester
BUDDY: ( shakes Lester's hand ) It's a pleasure.
LESTER: Oh, we've met before, actually. This thing last year. Or the Christmas thing at the Sheraton.
BUDDY: Oh, yes.
LESTER: It's okay. I wouldn't remember me either.
CAROLYN: ( forced gaiety ) Honey. Don't be weird.
LESTER: All right, honey. I won't be weird. I'll be whatever you want me to be.
BUDDY: I see.
LESTER: Well. I don't know about you, but I need a drink.
LESTER: Whoa. Put a little more in there, cowboy.
RICKY: Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood Trail? The house with the red door?
LESTER: ( suspicious ) I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved into the house next to you.
RICKY: I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved into the house next to you.
LESTER: Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts. I'm Lester Burnham.
RICKY: Hi, Lester Burnham.
LESTER: Excuse me?
RICKY: Do you get high?
CAROLYN: You know, I probably wouldn't even tell you this if I weren't a little tipsy, but. I am in complete awe of you. I mean, your firm is, hands down, the Rolls Royce of local Real Estate firms, and your personal sales record is, is, is very intimidating. You know, I'd love to sit down with you and just pick your brain, if you'd ever be willing. I suppose, technically, I'm the "competition," but. I mean, hey, I don't flatter myself that I'm even in the same league as you.
BUDDY: I'd love to.
CAROLYN: ( shocked ) Absolutely. Call my secretary and have her schedule a lunch.
BUDDY: Absolutely. Call my secretary and have her schedule a lunch.
CAROLYN: I'll do that. Thank you.
LESTER: .did you ever see that movie, where the body's walking around holding its own head? And then the head goes down on that Look. I'm not paying you to. .do whatever it is you're doing out Fine. So don't pay me.
RICKY: ( CONTINUED )
CATERING BOSS: ( to Ricky ) Look. I'm not paying you to. ( eyes Lester, suspiciously ) .do whatever it is you're doing out Fine. So don't pay me.
RICKY: Fine. So don't pay me.
CATERING BOSS: Excuse me?
RICKY: I quit. So you don't have to pay me. Now, leave me alone.
CATERING BOSS: He goes back inside. Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs.
LESTER: I think you just became my personal hero. Doesn't that make you nervous, just quitting your job like that? Well, I guess when you're all of, what? Sixteen?
RICKY: ( then ) I just do these gigs as a cover. I have other sources of income. But my dad interferes less in my life when I pretend to be an upstanding young citizen with a respectable job.
LESTER: Honey, this is. Ricky Fitts. This is Ricky Fitts.
RICKY: I'm Ricky Fitts, I just moved in the house next to you. I go to school with your daughter.
LESTER: With Jane? Really?
RICKY: Yeah. Jane.
CAROLYN: ( then, to Lester ) I'm ready to go. I'll meet you out front.
LESTER: Uh-oh. I'm in trouble. Nice meeting you, Ricky Fitts. Thanks for the, uh, thing.
RICKY: Any time.
JANE: Oh, shit. They're home. Quick, let's go up to my room.
ANGELA: I should say hi to your dad. I don't want to be rude.
ANGELA: I love root beer, don't you?
JANE: Mom, you remember Angela.
CAROLYN: ( her sales smile ) Yes, of course!
JANE: I forgot to tell you, she's spending the night. Is that okay?
LESTER: He takes a sip of his root beer, but it goes down the wrong way and he starts COUGHING violently.
JANE: I'm sorry about my dad.
ANGELA: Don't be. I think it's funny.
JANE: Yeah, to you, he's just another guy who wants to jump your bones. But to me. he's just too embarrassing to live.
ANGELA: Your mom's the one who's embarrassing. What a phony.
JANE: Shut up.
JANE: Shut up.
ANGELA: Oh, come on. Like you've never sneaked a peek at him in his underwear? I bet he's got a big dick.
JANE: You are so grossing me out right now.
ANGELA: ( really enjoying this ) If he built up his chest and arms, I would totally fuck him.
JANE: Yeah, it was the sound of you being a huge disgusting pig.
ANGELA: I'm serious.
ANGELA: It's that psycho next door. Jane, what if he worships you? What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff?
JANE: Shit. I bet he's filming us right now.
ANGELA: ( intrigued )
LESTER: Shit. Shit!
RICKY: Welcome to America's Weirdest Home
RICKY: Coming, Dad.
RICKY: I'm sorry, I must have locked it by accident. So what's up?
COLONEL: I need a urine sample.
RICKY: Wow. It's been six months already. Can I give it to you in the morning? I just took a whiz.
COLONEL: Yeah, I suppose. Well. Good night, son.
ANGELA: I've been waiting for you.
CAROLYN: What are you doing?
LESTER: Carolyn switches on the bedside LIGHT.
CAROLYN: You were masturbating.
LESTER: I was not.
CAROLYN: Yes, you were.
LESTER: All right, so shoot me. I was whacking
CAROLYN: That's disgusting.
LESTER: Well, excuse me, but I still have blood pumping through my veins!
CAROLYN: So do I!
LESTER: Really? I'm the only one who seems to be doing anything about it.
CAROLYN: Lester. I refuse to live like this. This is not a marriage.
LESTER: This hasn't been a marriage for years. But you were happy as long as I kept my mouth shut. Well, guess what? I've changed. And the new me whacks off when he feels horny, because you're obviously not going to help me out in that Oh. I see. You think you're the only one who's sexually frustrated?
CAROLYN: Oh. I see. You think you're the only one who's sexually frustrated?
LESTER: I'm not? Well then, come on, baby! I'm Do not mess with me, mister, or I will divorce you so fast it'll make your head On what grounds? I'm not a drunk, I don't fuck other women, I don't mistreat you, I've never hit you, or even tried to touch you since you made it so abundantly clear just how unnecessary you consider me to be. But. I did support you while you got your license. And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours. Turn out the light when you come to bed,
CAROLYN: ( furious ) Do not mess with me, mister, or I will divorce you so fast it'll make your head On what grounds? I'm not a drunk, I don't fuck other women, I don't mistreat you, I've never hit you, or even tried to touch you since you made it so abundantly clear just how unnecessary you consider me to be. But. I did support you while you got your license. And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours. Turn out the light when you come to bed,
LESTER: On what grounds? I'm not a drunk, I don't fuck other women, I don't mistreat you, I've never hit you, or even tried to touch you since you made it so abundantly clear just how unnecessary you consider me to be. But. I did support you while you got your license. And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours. Turn out the light when you come to bed,
LESTER: It's a great thing when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself. Makes you wonder what else you can do that you've forgotten about.
LESTER: Hey! You guys! Lester, I didn't know you ran.
JIM #2: Lester, I didn't know you ran.
LESTER: ( panting ) Well, I just started.
JIM #1: Good for you.
LESTER: I figured you guys might be able to give me some pointers. I need to shape up. Well, are you just looking to lose weight, or do you want have increased strength and flexibility as well?
JIM #1: Well, are you just looking to lose weight, or do you want have increased strength and flexibility as well?
LESTER: I want to look good naked.
COLONEL: What is this, the fucking gay pride
LESTER: Hey! Yo! Ricky! My entire life is passing before my eyes, and those two have barely broken a sweat.
COLONEL: ( shakes ) COLONEL Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.
LESTER: Whoa. Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.
RICKY: ( quickly ) You want to borrow it? ( before Lester can answer ) Okay, it's up in my room. Come on.
LESTER: You want to borrow it? Okay, it's up in my room. Come on.
RICKY: You want to borrow it? Okay, it's up in my room. Come on.
RICKY: Can you hold this for a sec?
LESTER: He gives the URINE SPECIMEN to Lester, then locks the door.
RICKY: I don't think my dad would try to come in when somebody else is here, but you never
LESTER: ( re: urine sample ) What is this?
RICKY: Urine. I have to take a drug test every six months to make sure I'm clean.
LESTER: Are you kidding? You just smoked with me last night.
RICKY: It's not mine. One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician's office. I cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss.
LESTER: You like Pink Floyd?
RICKY: I like a lot of music.
LESTER: Man, I haven't listened to this album in
RICKY: How much do you want?
LESTER: I don't know, it's been a while. How much is an ounce?
RICKY: ( indicates bag ) Well, this is totally decent, and it's three hundred.
LESTER: ( indicates another bag ) But this shit is top of the line. It's called G-13. Genetically engineered by the U.S. Government. Extremely potent. But a completely mellow high, no Is that what we smoked last night?
RICKY: ( indicates another bag ) But this shit is top of the line. It's called G-13. Genetically engineered by the U.S. Government. Extremely potent. But a completely mellow high, no Is that what we smoked last night?
LESTER: Is that what we smoked last night?
RICKY: This is all I ever smoke.
LESTER: How much?
RICKY: Two grand.
LESTER: Jesus. Things have changed since 1973.
RICKY: You don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it.
LESTER: ( hands him a bag ) There's a card in there with my beeper number, call me anytime day or night. And I only accept cash.
RICKY: ( hands him a bag ) There's a card in there with my beeper number, call me anytime day or night. And I only accept cash.
LESTER: ( looks around room ) Well, now I know how you can afford all this equipment. When I was your age, I flipped burgers all summer just to be able to buy an eight track.
RICKY: That sucks.
LESTER: No actually, it was great. All I did was party and get laid. I had my whole life ahead of me.
RICKY: My dad thinks I pay for all this with catering jobs. Never underestimate the power of denial.
LESTER: Uh-oh, mom's mad.
CAROLYN: What the hell do you think you're doing?
LESTER: Bench presses. I'm going to wail on my pecs, and then I'm going to do my back.
CAROLYN: I see you're smoking pot now. I'm so glad. I think using illegal psychotropic substances is a very positive example to set for our daughter.
LESTER: You're one to talk, you bloodless, money- grubbing freak.
CAROLYN: ( hostile ) Lester. You have such hostility in you!
LESTER: Do you mind? I'm trying to work out here. Unless you want to spot me.
CAROLYN: You will not get away with this. You can be sure of that! That's. What. You. Think.
LESTER: ( as he lifts ) That's. What. You. Think.
BRAD: ( reads ) ".my job consists of basically masking my contempt for the assholes in charge, and, at least once a day, retiring to the men's room so I can jerk off, while I fantasize about a life that doesn't so closely resemble hell." ( looks up at Lester ) Well, you obviously have no interest in saving yourself.
LESTER: ( laughs ) Brad, for fourteen years I've been a whore for the advertising industry. The only way I could save myself now is if I start firebombing.
BRAD: Whatever. Management wants you gone by the end of the day.
LESTER: Well, just what sort of severance package is "management" prepared to offer me?
BRAD: What do you want?
LESTER: One year's salary, with benefits.
BRAD: That's not going to happen.
LESTER: Well, what do you say I throw in a little sexual harassment charge to boot?
BRAD: Against who?
LESTER: Against you.
BRAD: Man. You are one twisted fuck.
LESTER: ( standing ) Nope. I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose.
LESTER: INT. RESTAURANT - LATER THAT DAY Carolyn sits at a table, lost in thought. There are two menus on the table. After a moment, Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King, joins her. Carolyn immediately becomes warm and Carolyn smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name.
BUDDY: Carolyn smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name.
CAROLYN: Carolyn smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name.
BUDDY: I'm so sorry I kept you waiting. Christy left for New York this morning, and. let's just say things were very hectic around the house.
CAROLYN: What's she doing in New York?
BUDDY: She's moving there. Yes. We are splitting up.
CAROLYN: Buddy. I'm so sorry.
BUDDY: ( bitterly ) Yes, according to her, I'm too focused on my career. As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw. Well, she certainly knew how to take advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her. Oh. Wow. ( then, laughing ) Ah, it's for the best.
CAROLYN: When I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy.
BUDDY: Well, call me crazy, but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success, at all times.
ANGELA: RICKY ( O.C. )
ANGELA: I think maybe you forgot your medication today, mental boy.
JANE: ( uncomfortable ) Look. I want you to stop filming me.
RICKY: He looks at her, curious, his eyes searching hers. She doesn't look away.
ANGELA: Well, whatever. This is boring. Let's go.
JANE: ( to Ricky ) Do you need a ride?
ANGELA: ( to Jane ) Are you crazy? I don't want to end up hacked to pieces in a dumpster somewhere.
RICKY: It's okay. I'll walk. But thanks.
ANGELA: Yeah, see? He doesn't want to go anyway. C'mon, let's go.
JANE: ( calls off to Angela ) I think I'm going to walk, too.
ANGELA: What? Jane, that's like, almost a mile.
CAROLYN: Yes! Oh, God! I love it!
BUDDY: You like getting nailed by the king?
CAROLYN: Oh yes! I love it! Fuck me, your majesty!
LESTER: AMERICAN WOMAN, STAY AWAY FROM ME. AMERICAN WOMAN, MAMA LET ME BE. DON'T COME A HANGIN' AROUND MY DOOR. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE NO MORE.
LESTER: DRIVE-THRU GIRL ( O.C. )
LESTER: Uh. no. But thank you. I'll have a Big Barn Burger, Smiley fries, and an orange soda.
COUNTER GIRL: Would you like some Smiley Sauce?
LESTER: No. No, actually. I'd like to fill out an application.
COUNTER GIRL: There's not jobs for manager, it's just for counter.
LESTER: Good. I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility.
MANAGER: I don't think you'd fit in here.
LESTER: I have fast food experience.
MANAGER: Yeah, like twenty years ago.
LESTER: Well, I'm sure there have been amazing technological advances in the industry, but surely you have some sort of training process. It seems unfair to presume I won't be able to learn.
CAROLYN: That was exactly what I needed. The royal treatment, so to speak.
BUDDY: Know what I do when I feel like that?
CAROLYN: I fire a gun.
BUDDY: I fire a gun.
CAROLYN: ( intrigued ) Oh yeah, I go to this little firing range downtown, and I just pop off a few ( embarrassed ) I've never fired a gun before.
BUDDY: Oh yeah, I go to this little firing range downtown, and I just pop off a few I've never fired a gun before.
CAROLYN: ( embarrassed ) I've never fired a gun before.
BUDDY: Oh, you've gotta try it. Nothing makes you feel more powerful. Well, almost nothing.
JANE: So how do you like your new house?
RICKY: I like it.
JANE: The people who used to live there fed these stray cats, so they were always around, and it drove my mother nuts. And then she cut down their tree.
RICKY: Have you ever known anybody who died?
JANE: ( a beat ) Have you?
RICKY: No, but I did see this homeless woman who froze to death once. Just laying there on the sidewalk. She looked really sad.
JANE: Why would you film that?
RICKY: Because it was amazing.
JANE: What was amazing about it?
RICKY: When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back.
JANE: And what do you see?
RICKY: INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space as if hypnotized. Behind her, Ricky enters, followed by Barbara's eyes flutter and she turns to him slowly.
RICKY: Mom, I want you to meet somebody.
BARBARA: ( pleasant ) I want you to meet somebody. This is Oh, my. I apologize for the way things look around here.
RICKY: I want you to meet somebody. This is Oh, my. I apologize for the way things look around here.
JANE: Oh, my. I apologize for the way things look around here.
BARBARA: Oh, my. I apologize for the way things look around here.
RICKY: This is where my dad hides out.
JANE: I take it he's got a thing for guns.
RICKY: You got to see this one thing.
JANE: Did you steal his keys?
RICKY: No. One of my clients is a locksmith. He was short on cash one night, so I let him pay me in trade.
JANE: Oh my God.
RICKY: It's like official state china of the Third Reich. There's a whole subculture of people who collect this Nazi shit. But my dad just has this one thing.
JANE: ( concerned ) No, you're scared of me.
RICKY: ( concerned ) No, you're scared of me.
JANE: No I'm not.
RICKY: You want to see the most beautiful thing I've ever filmed?
RICKY: It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing. And there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it, right? And this bag was just. dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. That's the day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid. Ever.
JANE: ( suddenly ) Oh my God. What time is it?
JANE: Sorry I'm late.
CAROLYN: ( overly cheerful ) No, no, that's quite all right, dear. Your father and I were just discussing his day at work. ( to Lester ) Why don't you tell our daughter about it,
LESTER: Janie, today I quit my job. And then I told my boss to fuck himself, and then I blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand dollars. Pass the asparagus.
CAROLYN: Your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of.
LESTER: And your mother seems to prefer I go through life like a fucking prisoner while she keeps my dick in a mason jar under the sink.
CAROLYN: ( ashen ) How dare you speak to me that way in front of her? And I marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me, on the same day that you lose your job!
LESTER: Lose it? I didn't lose it. It's not like, "Oops, where'd my job go?" I quit. Someone pass me the asparagus.
CAROLYN: Oh! Oh! And I want to thank you for putting me under the added pressure of being the sole breadwinner now
LESTER: I already have a job.
CAROLYN: ( not stopping ) No, no, don't give a second thought as to who's going to pay the mortgage. We'll just leave it all up to Carolyn. You mean, you're going to take care of everything now, Carolyn? Yes. I don't mind. I really don't. You mean, everything? You don't mind having the sole responsibility, your husband feels he can just quit his job
LESTER: ( overlapping ) Will someone pass me the fucking ( rises ) Okay, I'm not going to be a part of this
JANE: ( rises ) Okay, I'm not going to be a part of this
LESTER: ( means it ) Sit down. I'm sick and tired of being treated like I don't exist. You two do whatever you want to do whenever you want to do it and I don't complain. All I want is the same ( overlapping ) Oh, you don't complain? Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. I must be psychotic then, if you don't complain. What is this?! Am I locked away in a padded cell somewhere, hallucinating? That's the only explanation I can think of
CAROLYN: ( overlapping ) Oh, you don't complain? Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. I must be psychotic then, if you don't complain. What is this?! Am I locked away in a padded cell somewhere, hallucinating? That's the only explanation I can think of
LESTER: ( casual ) Don't interrupt me, honey.
JANE: Go. Away.
JANE: Why, so I could see what freaks you and Dad really are?
CAROLYN: She stares at Jane, then starts to cry.
JANE: Aw, Christ, Mom.
CAROLYN: ( tearful ) No, I'm glad because you're old enough now to learn the most important lesson in life: you cannot count on anyone except ( sighs ) You cannot count on anyone except yourself. It's sad, but true, and the sooner you learn it, the better.
JANE: Look, Mom, I really don't feel like having a Kodak moment here, okay?
CAROLYN: You ungrateful little brat. Just look at everything you have. When I was your age, I lived in a duplex. We didn't even have our own house.
COLONEL: You little bastard How did you get in there?
COLONEL: ( unnerved ) How!? How?! C'mon, get up! Fight back, you little pussy!
RICKY: No, sir. I won't fight you.
COLONEL: How did you get in there?
RICKY: I picked the lock, sir.
COLONEL: What were you looking for? Money? Are you on dope again?
RICKY: No, sir. I wanted to show my girlfriend your Nazi plate.
COLONEL: Yes, sir. She lives next door.
RICKY: Yes, sir. She lives next door.
COLONEL: This is for your own good, boy. You have no respect for other people's things, for authority, for.
RICKY: Sir, I'm sorry.
COLONEL: You can't just go around doing whatever you feel like, you can'tthere are rules in life
RICKY: Yes, sir.
COLONEL: You need structure, you need discipline
RICKY: ( simultaneous ) Discipline. Yes, sir, thank you for trying to teach me. Don't give up on me,
COLONEL: Oh, Ricky.
ATTENDANT: ( loading gun ) I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham, when you first came here I thought you would be hopeless. But you're a natural.
CAROLYN: Well, all I know is. I love shooting this gun!
LESTER: Ah, whose car is that out front?
CAROLYN: Ah, whose car is that out front?
LESTER: Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird. The car I always wanted and now I have it. I rule!
CAROLYN: Where's the Camry?
LESTER: I traded it in.
CAROLYN: Shouldn't you have consulted me first?
LESTER: Hmm, let me think. No. You never drove Have you done something different? You look great.
CAROLYN: ( brusque ) Where's Jane?
LESTER: Jane not home. We have the whole house to
CAROLYN: ( taken aback ) Joyless?! I am not joyless! There happens to be a lot about me that you don't know, mister smarty man. There is plenty of joy in my life.
LESTER: ( leaning toward her ) Whatever happened to that girl who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored? And who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building to flash the traffic helicopters? Have you totally forgotten about her? Because I
CAROLYN: ( barely audible ) Lester. You're going to spill beer on the
LESTER: So what? It's just a couch.
CAROLYN: This is a four thousand dollar sofa upholstered in Italian silk. This is not "just a couch."
LESTER: It's just a couch!
JANE: ( shy )
RICKY: ( re: image on TV ) It's weird, watching myself. I don't like how I look.
JANE: ( re: image on TV ) It's weird, watching myself. I don't like how I look.
RICKY: I can't believe you don't know how beautiful you are.
JANE: I'm not going to sit here for that shit.
RICKY: You don't feel naked?
JANE: You don't feel naked?
RICKY: I am naked.
JANE: You know what I mean.
RICKY: When I was fifteen, my dad caught me smoking dope. He totally freaked and decided to send me to military school. I told you his whole thing about structure and discipline, right? Well, of course, I got kicked out. Dad and I had this huge fight, and he hit me. and then the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut, and. I just snapped. I wanted to kill him. And I would have. Killed him. If they hadn't pulled me off. That's when my dad put me in the hospital. Then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years.
JANE: Wow. You must really hate him.
RICKY: He's not a bad man.
JANE: Well. you better believe I'd hate my father if he did something like that to Wait. I do hate my father.
RICKY: He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses it on her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes.
JANE: He's a total asshole and he's got this crush on my friend Angela and it's You'd rather he had the crush on you?
RICKY: You'd rather he had the crush on you?
JANE: Gross, no! But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near as important to him as she
RICKY: Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face.
JANE: Well, now, I too need structure. A little fucking discipline.
RICKY: Want me to kill him for you?
JANE: Yeah, would you?
RICKY: ( smiles ) It'll cost you.
JANE: Well, I've been baby-sitting since I was about ten. I've got almost three thousand dollars. 'Course, I was saving it up for a boob job.
RICKY: You know, that's not a very nice thing to do, hiring somebody to kill your dad.
JANE: Well, I guess I'm just not a very nice girl, then, am I? You know I'm not serious, right?
RICKY: Of course.
LESTER: Remember those posters that said, "Today is the first day of the rest of your life?" Well, that's true of every day except one. The day you die.
CAROLYN: Jane, hurry up. I've got a very important Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over
JANE: Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over
CAROLYN: Well, of course, she's always welcome. You know, I thought maybe you two had a fight. I haven't seen her around here in a while.
LESTER: ( nervous ) I've been too embarrassed to bring her over. Because of you, and the way that you behave.
JANE: ( nervous ) I've been too embarrassed to bring her over. Because of you, and the way that you behave.
LESTER: What are you talking about? I've barely even spoken to her.
JANE: ( angry ) Dad! You stare at her all the time, like you're drunk! It's disgusting!
LESTER: ( angry himself ) You better watch yourself, Janie, or you're going to turn into a real bitch, just like your mother.
COLONEL: ( brusque ) You ready to go?
RICKY: Oh, I don't need a ride. I'm going to go in with Jane and her mom.
LESTER: Yo, Ricky. How's it going?
RICKY: Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.
LESTER: You need more than that, my little
CAROLYN: I think we deserve a little junk food, after the workout we had this morning.
BUDDY: ( nuzzles her neck ) I'm flattered.
LESTER: ( overly cheerful ) Smile! You're at Mr. Smiley's!
CAROLYN: ( re: Buddy ) We were just at a seminar. ( then, all business ) Buddy, this is my
LESTER: Her husband. We've met before, but something tells me you're going to remember me this time.
COUNTER GIRL: ( to Carolyn ) Whoa. You are so busted.
CAROLYN: ( flustered ) You know, this really doesn't concern Actually, Janeane is senior drive-thru manager, so you kind of are on her turf. ( to Carolyn, quietly ) So. This makes sense.
LESTER: Actually, Janeane is senior drive-thru manager, so you kind of are on her turf. So. This makes sense.
CAROLYN: ( miserable ) Oh, Lester
LESTER: Honey, it's okay. I want you to be happy. Would you like Smiley Sauce with that?
CAROLYN: Lester, just stop it!
LESTER: Uh-uh. You don't get to tell me what to do. Ever again.
BUDDY: I'm sorry. I guess we should cool it for a while. I'm facing a potentially very expensive divorce.
CAROLYN: Oh, no. I understand completely. In order to be successful, one must project an image of success. At all
LESTER: INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER Ricky and the Colonel sit at the table, eating in silence. Barbara rinses off a pan at the sink, then stares at it as if she can't quite remember what she meant to do with it. We suddenly HEAR a BEEPING noise. Ricky pulls his BEEPER off his belt and checks it.
RICKY: ( getting up ) I have to run next door. Jane left her geometry book in my bag and she needs it to do her homework.
ANGELA: So you and psycho boy are fucking on like, a regular basis now, right?
JANE: ( irritable ) Oh, come on. You can tell me. Does he have a big dick?
ANGELA: Oh, come on. You can tell me. Does he have a big dick?
JANE: Look, I'm not gonna talk about his dick with you, okay? It's not like that.
ANGELA: Not like what? Doesn't he have one? Why don't you want to talk about it? I mean, I tell you every single detail about every guy that I fuck.
JANE: Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't, all right? Maybe I don't really want to hear all Oh, so now that you have a boyfriend, you're like, above it? We gotta get you a real man.
ANGELA: Oh, so now that you have a boyfriend, you're like, above it? We gotta get you a real man.
RICKY: ( grins ) You got any papers?
LESTER: Yeah, in the cigar box, right over there. You know, put up a fight, dude! You are such a pushover. "No I can't. Really.
RICKY: You should learn to roll a joint.
LESTER: Oh. Hi.
JANE: Where's Mom?
LESTER: Don't know.
ANGELA: Hi, Mr. Burnham.
LESTER: He's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job.
ANGELA: Wow. Look at you. Have you been working
LESTER: Jane rolls her eyes and exits. Angela walks over to Lester.
ANGELA: You can really tell. Look at those arms.
LESTER: You like muscles? II should probably go see what Jane's up to.
ANGELA: II should probably go see what Jane's up to.
RICKY: From my job.
COLONEL: Don't lie to me. I saw you with him.
RICKY: ( incredulous ) You were watching me?
COLONEL: What did he make you do?
RICKY: ( laughs ) Dad, you don't really think. me and Mr. ( furious ) Don't you laugh at me! ( then )
COLONEL: ( furious ) Don't you laugh at me! ( then )
RICKY: Jesus, what is with you I swear to God, I will throw you out of this house and never look at you again.
COLONEL: I swear to God, I will throw you out of this house and never look at you again.
RICKY: ( taken aback ) You mean that?
COLONEL: Damn straight I do. I'd rather you were dead than be a fucking faggot.
RICKY: You're right. I suck dick for money.
COLONEL: Two thousand dollars. I'm that good.
RICKY: Two thousand dollars. I'm that good.
COLONEL: Get out.
RICKY: And you should see me fuck. I'm the best piece of ass in three states.

RICKY: What a sad old man you are.
COLONEL: ( a whisper ) Get out.
RICKY: Mom, I'm leaving.
BARBARA: Okay, wear a raincoat.
RICKY: ( hugs her ) I wish things would have been better for you. Take care of Dad.
TAPE VOICE: disinvesting problems of their power, and removing their ability to make us afraid. This is the secret to "me- centered" living.
JANE: I don't think we could be friends You are way too uptight about sex.
ANGELA: You are way too uptight about sex.
JANE: Just don't fuck my dad, all right? Why not?
ANGELA: Why not?
JANE: ( angry ) Dad! Leave us alone!
JANE: If I had to go to New York. To live. Tonight. Would you come with me?

ANGELA: You guys can't be serious. You're just a kid. And he's like, a mental case. You'll end up living in a box on the street.
JANE: I'm no more a kid than you are! We can use my plastic surgery money.
RICKY: We won't have to. I have over forty thousand dollars. And I know people in the city who can help us get set up.
ANGELA: What, other drug dealers?
RICKY: Jane, you'd be out of your mind to go with him.
ANGELA: Jane, you'd be out of your mind to go with him.
JANE: Why do you even care?
ANGELA: Because you're my friend!
RICKY: She's not your friend. She's somebody you use to feel better about yourself.
ANGELA: Go fuck yourself, psycho!
JANE: You shut up, bitch!
ANGELA: Jane! He is a freak!
JANE: Well, then so am I! And we'll always be freaks and we'll never be like other people. And you'll never be a freak because you're just too perfect.
ANGELA: Oh, yeah? Well, at least I'm not ugly.
RICKY: Yes, you are. And you're boring. And you're totally ordinary. And you know it.
ANGELA: You two deserve each other.

LESTER: You want me to get Ricky? He's in Jane's
COLONEL: ( his voice thick ) Where's your wife?
LESTER: Uh. I don't know. Probably out fucking that dorky prince of real estate asshole. And you know what? I don't care.
COLONEL: Your wife is with another man and you don't care?
LESTER: Nope, our marriage is just for show. A commercial, for how normal we are. When we are anything but.
COLONEL: ( a whisper ) It's okay.
LESTER: It's okay.
COLONEL: ( hoarse )
LESTER: ( softly ) Just tell me what you need.
TAPE VOICE: "I refuse to be a victim." When this becomes your mantra, constantly running through your head
CAROLYN: I refuse to be a victim.
ANGELA: I hope you don't mind if I play the
LESTER: Not at all. Bad night?
ANGELA: Not really bad, just. strange.
LESTER: ( grins ) Believe me. It couldn't possibly be any stranger than mine. Jane and I had a fight. ( after a beat ) It was about you.
ANGELA: Jane and I had a fight. It was about you.
LESTER: ( offering beer ) Do you want a sip?
ANGELA: I don't know.

LESTER: You have nothing to be sorry about.
ANGELA: Wow. I was starving.
LESTER: Do you want me to make you another one?

LESTER: ( concerned ) You sure?
ANGELA: I mean, I'm still a little weirded out, .I feel better. Thanks.
LESTER: How's Jane?
ANGELA: What do you mean?
LESTER: I mean, how's her life? Is she happy? Is she miserable? I'd really like to know, and she'd die before she'd ever tell me about it.
ANGELA: She's. she's really happy. She thinks she's in love.
LESTER: ( quietly ) Good for her.
ANGELA: How are you?
LESTER: ( smiles, taken aback ) God, it's been a long time since anybody asked me that. ( thinks about it ) I'm great.
ANGELA: ( suddenly ) I've gotta go to the bathroom.
LESTER: ( laughs ) I'm great. Man oh man. ( softly ) Man oh man oh man.
JANE: Oh God.
RICKY: ( an awed whisper ) I had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die.
