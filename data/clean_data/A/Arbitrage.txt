ROBERT: They lived through the Depression, Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb. And they didn't think bad things might happen; they knew they would happen.
MARIA: Is that what's happening now?
ROBERT: When I was a kid my favorite teacher was Mr. James. Mr. James said that world events always revolve around five things: ( extending his fingers one-
ROBERT: Goldenrod - 4.17.11 2.
MARIA: ( LAUGHING )
ROBERT: This was fifth-grade econ. ( smiles, off her laugh ) But this is something we've seen over and over again, time and time again, that competition for this limited amount of dollars out there, can make even the best of us manic. So it's not surprising that we see these asset bubbles, but when reality sets in of course, they burst.
"ARBITRAGE": CLOUDS GIVE WAY TO A: FALCON 900EX - SOARING THROUGH THE SKIES AT 550MPH And we push tighter into the plane, cutting into the engine, as we hear a sonic boom and focus inside, revealing.

GAVIN: ( handing him the coffee ) Here you go. Robert sips it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 3.
ROBERT: Quants? Derivatives structures? What was that about?
GAVIN: It makes no sense.
ROBERT: That's what you said last week. Why'd we go down there?
GAVIN: To sign.
ROBERT: And did we sign?
GAVIN: No. We did not. Instead I fly two thousand miles for a marketing meeting. And where was Mayfield? What was this "emergency"? What was that about?
ROBERT: No. We did not. Instead I fly two thousand miles for a marketing meeting. And where was Mayfield? What was this "emergency"? What was that about?
GAVIN: ( after a beat ) Did you speak to the auditors?
ROBERT: What if. we don't don't close this We push into a close-up of Robert, as he contemplates what this would mean.
GAVIN: What if. we don't don't close this We push into a close-up of Robert, as he contemplates what this would mean.
ELLEN: ( LIGHTING UP )
ROBERT: Hi, guys! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 5.
GRANDCHILD: Hi Grampi! What did you bring us? Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other. They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast to his behavior towards their kids.
BROOKE: It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs. You're spoiling them rotten.
ROBERT: ( GRINNING )
BROOKE: ( HALF-SMILE )
ROBERT: ( to Peter, as they hug and
SMILE ): How you doin', son? Good? Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.
ELLEN: We had to eat. The kids were ( hugging her, happy ) No, no that's okay. Where's my drink, is this mine, here? Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.
ROBERT: ( hugging her, happy ) No, no that's okay. Where's my drink, is this mine, here? Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.
ALL: HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY! Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a Thank you, thank you, thank you all very much, it's such a surprise, I didn't even know it was my birthday! Everyone laughs a little. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 6.
ROBERT: Thank you, thank you, thank you all very much, it's such a surprise, I didn't even know it was my birthday! Everyone laughs a little. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 6.
PETER: ( CALLING OUT )
ROBERT: ( SMILES )
ELLEN: Oh, here we go! More group LAUGHTER.
ROBERT: Although your one-track mind assures me you've got not only your mother's genes, but you've got mine, too! More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter across the room.
ALL: ( as they applaud ) Hear, hear! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 7.
ROBERT: Kids are wild.
BROOKE: ( LAUGHING )
ROBERT: No, no no, you should have I want more "you's" around. Robert brings the drinks to the banquette where Brooke rests with an open FOLDER. He resumes signing papers.
BROOKE: ( LAUGHS )
ROBERT: Yeah, yeah yeah. Brooke nods, tries to smile.
BROOKE: So what was that all about?
ROBERT: The last time you made a speech like that we lost the Firestone bid.
BROOKE: The last time you made a speech like that we lost the Firestone bid.
ROBERT: ( LAUGHS )
BROOKE: You see this? He looks closely at it. A "Forbes" cover story: "Robert Miller, the Oracle of Gracie Square: Investor profits in uncertain times by predicting housing crisis." Goldenrod - 4.17.11 8.
ROBERT: ( shakes his head ) Yeah. Oy. You know how I feel about that. Trash can.
BROOKE: Peter's got a copy pinned up in the conference room.
ROBERT: ( sits back, takes a drink ) Well, you gonna keep skirting around it? Brooke leans back and stares at him.
BROOKE: Why sell our company? We make a great return, we give money to the causes we believe in.
ROBERT: My darling, you are still in your 20's. I am 60. That's a big difference in point of view.
BROOKE: Dad, you're not that old.
ROBERT: ( LAUGHS )
BROOKE: ( LAUGHS )
ELLEN: Where are you going?
ROBERT: Yeah I gotta finish up that thing. She holds a beat, then approaches and straightens his collar.
ELLEN: Yeah I gotta finish up that thing. She holds a beat, then approaches and straightens his collar.
ROBERT: Yeah I gotta finish up that thing. She holds a beat, then approaches and straightens his collar.
ELLEN: ( SMILES )
ROBERT: ( SMILING BACK )
ROBERT: ( into his phone ) Yeah, Gavin, it's me, uhh. When you get this I want you to call Chris Vogler at Fremaut, tell him I need to see him right away, okay?
JULIE: ( standing in frustration ) She crosses to the open kitchen and pours out more wine, lights a cigarette. Robert trails.
ROBERT: Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm always late you know that and I'm sorry. And I'm always saying I'm sorry about being ( crosses to her ) It doesn't mean I wouldn't rather be here with you. They stare at each other as she drags off the cigarette, then stubs it out. He gestures to the dining table.
JULIE: ( FINALLY )
ROBERT: ( slight beat, then
DEFINITIVE ): I will be there. She stares, still in the moment. Then she heads to the fridge and slides out a homemade BIRTHDAY CAKE. He stares at it.
JULIE: I made this for you.
ROBERT: You made this? This is amazing. One candle, thank you very. She reaches for the cake, grabbing a piece of it with her hand and. SMEARS IT ONTO HIS FACE. The tension breaks, and they LAUGH. He grabs her and they kiss furiously, pulling at each other's clothes as she pushes him backwards into the bedroom and they begin to make love.
JEFFREY: Thank you, Diane. She exits. Robert sits. A moment of silence.
ROBERT: I'm here.
JEFFREY: Guess what's not?
ROBERT: Jeffrey, I told you, I'm.
JEFFREY: ".working on it," yeah. Well, while you're doing that, lemme tell you what's not working.
ROBERT: ( LEANING FORWARD )
JEFFREY: ( LOUDER )
ROBERT: What do you want me to say?
JEFFREY: That you're gonna get a signature from Mayfield, and that my hostage money and my fee are going to be sent to me promptly, say. by tomorrow? A beat.
ROBERT: I am solving the problem. I am getting you your money and your fee. You will have them very shortly.
JEFFREY: As soon as they sign the contract.
ROBERT: As soon as they sign the contract.
JEFFREY: ( BEAT )
ROBERT: .Stop it! You don't have to talk to me like that!.
JEFFREY: I didn't get you into this mess!
ROBERT: You were a friend of mine!. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 13.
JEFFREY: .remember when you asked me if it was a good idea to divert half your liquid assets into a fucking copper mine? What did I tell you?
ROBERT: ( stands, heading to door
JEFFREY: ( MATTER-OF-FACT )
ROBERT: ( SHAKES HEAD )
JEFFREY: .the fuck I can't, it's in an escrow bill with one-day call rights.
ROBERT: .I need the money there until they sign, Jeffrey. What if they check again?
JEFFREY: That's really not my problem, is it?
ROBERT: ( stares, fumes ) Not your fuckin problem.
ROBERT: ( TO RAMON )
CNBC ANNOUNCER: The DOW continues its uptick this morning on new housing starts to rise 132 points. Asian markets fared less well, especially in Russia, where further nationalization plans caused foreign investment to sputter, leading to various. Close on Robert, trying hard to contain his building rage. His phone VIBRATES a TEXT, from Julie: "See you at 8!" He stares at it, breathes in deeply. The CARPHONE rings: "Gavin."
ROBERT: ( BARKS )
ROBERT: ( calming a little ) Good. Very good.
ROBERT: Is this too blue?
ELLEN: It's the third one you've tried. She finishes tying it. He looks in the mirror.
ROBERT: Ay, yay yay. I look old.
ELLEN: You look regal, and wise, and granted a little worried. What is going on? Are you afraid of this meeting?
ROBERT: They haven't signed the papers.
ELLEN: I thought that's why you flew down there. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 15.
ROBERT: ( rubbing his eyes ) So did I, but for some reason they're stalling. I didn't get any sleep on the plane and.
ELLEN: Now come on. It will all work out. Just follow the plan.
ROBERT: What plan is that?
ELLEN: "Confidence equals contract."
ROBERT: ( LAUGHS )
ELLEN: They're your words, actually.
ROBERT: Then you married an idiot.
ELLEN: ( BEAT )
ROBERT: ( GROWING UNCOMFORTABLE )
ELLEN: We have to make time. We go for a year. Let's take a year and get fat and have fun and go on an adventure. I mean seriously how much money do we need?. Do you wanna be the richest guy in the cemetery? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 16. He straightens his jacket, laughs.
ROBERT: I don't wanna be in the cemetery!
ELLEN: Oh, by the way, Mary called from St. Victor's Hospital, again, she said they still haven't gotten the check yet.
ROBERT: I'm taking care of it.
ELLEN: The gala is Friday. Should I be selling my ring? What's going on?
ROBERT: I've had to move some things around for the merger.
ELLEN: It's only two million.

ELLEN: ( SMILES )
ROBERT: You remember Riccio's? Full meals. two bucks. all you can eat. three I do remember. But I do not remember you being so sentimental unless you were trying to change the subject. A KNOCK at the door.

ROBERT: ( as he heads out, smiling ) I don't know what you're talking Ellen slaps his behind. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 17.
MAITRE'D: Mr. Miller, good to see you, sir. Your party has already arrived. He leads Robert and Gavin into the
ROBERT: ( sotto, to Gavin ) Where the hell is Mayfield? Gavin shakes his head. They approach the table.
BARNES: ( as they sit ) Mr. Miller, thank you for coming. We were just getting acquainted with Brooke and Peter here.
ROBERT: ( SMILING )
AIMES: They've been terrific.
PETER: Dad, we've been talking about operations. Tim thinks once we consolidate we can save about fifty percent on our back-office. Robert phone VIBRATES. It's "Julie" calling. He silences it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 18.
ROBERT: I'd love to hear about that, but.
AIMES: ( NODS )
BARNES: I was just telling Brooke: now that we can market your quants' track records, we have access to a host of new capital that. Robert drifts as the suits prattle on.
BARNES: .assuming we shed debt through some small liquidations, I'd say.
ROBERT: I'm sorry, gentlemen, we've been here nearly two hours now. Where is Mr. He just texted me. He's very sorry, but he's been detained.
AIMES: He just texted me. He's very sorry, but he's been detained.
ROBERT: Detained where? Alright, I think I can leave you with my family?
BARNES: Of course. Again, Mr. Miller, a privilege. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 19.
ROBERT: Yeah, yeah yeah. Robert refuses Aimes' hand and heads out. Brooke rises.
BROOKE: ( INDICATING )
GAVIN: ( TO AIMES )
AIMES: Port? Would you like to have some port?
BROOKE: Did you get my message?

ROBERT: How're they doing?
ASSISTANT: Great. Everyone loves them.
ROBERT: Yeah, but how are they doing?
ASSISTANT: He scans the party further. No Julie.
ROBERT: Where's Julie?
ASSISTANT: She's in the back.
ROBERT: Hey, Julie.
JULIE: ( to the group ) This is Robert Miller, one of our collectors. This Katrina Stanton, and Alex Stanton and their daughter Ava, who is a talented young artist. Robert shakes hands with the group, exchanging pleasantries, especially kind to young AVA ( 15 ).
ROBERT: Oh, really? Painter?
AVA: Julie begins to walk off, disappearing into the crowd.
ROBERT: ( LOOKING AROUND )
JULIE: Go away. Julie heads back to the buyers. Dismayed, Robert takes a last glance, then recedes out towards the entry desk. He approaches the gallery assistant he was talking to earlier and picks up the buy sheet at the desk, marking some pieces.
ROBERT: I will take
ASSISTANT: ( pointing to list ) Right there, number seven.
ROBERT: Don't tell her it was me. ( off her nod ) I mean it.
ASSISTANT: You got it. Robert walks out and hails his driver.
PAINTER: .fucking Dalwood wouldn't know a Van Gogh from a Van Eyck. And they call it a "State of Contemporism." Julie's phone RINGS. She looks at the Caller-ID, ( which shows her home line calling ) confused.
JULIE: ( INTO PHONE )
JULIE: What do you want?
JULIE: INT. JULIE'S LOFT - BEDROOM Robert watches Julie through a crack in the doorway. He's on her CORDLESS phone. We INTERCUT.
ROBERT: I'm in your bedroom. Can you get those people out of here?
JULIE: Are you serious?
ROBERT: Look down the hall. Do you see me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 24.
JULIE: ( LOOKING )
ROBERT: Okay, so I'm serious. She hangs up and begins to clear out the guests. Robert sits, unbuttoning his collar.
JULIE: You just come in and out whenever you want?
ROBERT: I thought we should talk.
JULIE: ( laughs, then in a rage ) One damn night in a month I told you was important to me, et tu es meme pas capable d'etre la.
ROBERT: .I was working, do you understand? I'm under enormous pressure, I have obligations.
JULIE: .I don't want to hear about your obligations. If you cared YOU
ROBERT: I was there! I was there! I was late, but I was there. And I'm here now.
JULIE: No, no, no. You're here when it's convenient for you to be here. C'est pas ca l'amour. Love means
LIVING ROOM: Robert follows her. They stand at a great distance as she downs a red wine.
ROBERT: I'm sorry.
JULIE: Why did you buy those paintings?
ROBERT: Because I liked them. Her face falls slightly, but she keeps her grace and her anger.
JULIE: Okay, thank you for helping me get started. But if I'm gonna fail then let me fail!
ROBERT: Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why would you fail? He crosses towards her.
JULIE: What image?
ROBERT: He sits down next to her.
JULIE: ( QUIETLY )
BEDROOM: Julie is on the bed, holding herself, crying. Robert comes up next to her, hugs her.
ROBERT: Come away with me. Let's just take your car and go.
JULIE: There's a place upstate. Very beautiful, on the water. We can wake up there together- just you and me. I'd like that. She's keeps crying, but.

ROBERT: ( INTO PHONE )
OPERATOR: Your name, sir?
ROBERT: Lawrence Grant. RINGING, then.
ROBERT: Jimmy, it's me.
ROBERT: I want you to listen to me very EXT. CAR WRECKAGE SITE POLICE CARS flash lights. An EMT unloads Julie's charred CORPSE into a BODY BAG. INVESTIGATORS sift through rubble. DET. MICHAEL BRYER ( 43 ) sits in a TAN SEDAN, drinking a cup of deli coffee. Barely awake, he stares out the window at a bunch of STATE TROOPERS arguing with his partner, MILLS. MILLS breaks away from the uniforms and approaches, shaking his head. Bryer gets out of the car.
BRYER: You gotta be fucking kidding me.
MILLS: Catching detective wants us to rule before he calls it.
BRYER: We've been having the same fuckin' argument for twenty years.
MILLS: I'm not so sure about this. Bryer heads over to the car, his interest piqued. Mills shines his flashlight towards the passenger side.
BRYER: . So who kicked out the door? Bryer bends his head down to the car's passenger side, looking off into the distance of the path Robert took just moments before.
ROBERT: Let's go. They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty banged up.
JIMMY: You gonna tell me what this is?
ROBERT: It's better you don't ask.
JIMMY: So all you're sayin' is, you need a ride somewhere. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 30.
ROBERT: That's correct.
JIMMY: Because I want to be very clear about this: you called me to give you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.
ROBERT: No, you're not. We're not here.
JIMMY: Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?
ROBERT: We're both alseep right now. At home. Which is where you left your phone, right?
JIMMY: Because if anyone checks.
ROBERT: Because if anyone checks.
JIMMY: Why is anyone gonna check?
ROBERT: They're not, as long as we're not here. Anybody know you're here?
JIMMY: Somebody knows you're here?
ROBERT: Somebody knows you're here?
JIMMY: But somebody knows you're not there.
ROBERT: But somebody knows you're not there.
JIMMY: Well, my girl.
ROBERT: Oh, Jesus, Jimmy.
JIMMY: Man, you call up two am, what the fuck you want? She asked me where I was going.
ROBERT: What'd you say?
JIMMY: I told her I had to run out a minute. A beat.
ROBERT: Do you trust her?
JIMMY: Is this the kinda shit you used to do to my dad?
ROBERT: Do you trust her?
JIMMY: Yes, I fucking trust her!
ROBERT: Good. So you're at home, and I'm at home. My wife gets up at five am for Pilates I will be there next to her, where I've been all night. And you'll do the same with yours. Jimmy exhales a long sigh.
JIMMY: This is some pretty fucked up shit.
ROBERT: No, man, come on, I don't hear from you since the fuckin' funeral, you call me up out of the blue, using my father's name, ask me.
JIMMY: No, man, come on, I don't hear from you since the fuckin' funeral, you call me up out of the blue, using my father's name, ask me.
ROBERT: .what do you want, you want money? I will give you five thousand dollars! I will give you ten thousand dollars! I'll give you whatever you fuckin'. Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 32.
JIMMY: You wanna talk to me like that you can get the fuck outta my car and you can walk! You want that?! You wanna fuckin' walk home?!
ROBERT: ( after a beat ) Listen. I'm sorry. I'm not myself. I need your help. Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road. Robert winces in pain.
JIMMY: You alright? Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees the awful purple bruise from the steering column.
ROBERT: No, I just. have to get home. I'll deal with it in a couple of What if you don't make it a couple of hours?
JIMMY: What if you don't make it a couple of hours?
ROBERT: Then I don't make it.
JIMMY: ( through the window ) Call me, alright, and let me know it's okay.
ROBERT: ( as he exits ) Better we don't talk for a while.
JIMMY: ( can't believe it through the window ) So what you get in a bind and just call up the only nigger you know? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 33. Robert looks at Jimmy, eyes tearing.
ROBERT: I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. Just go home.
JIMMY: Yeah, alright, man. Take care of that. Jimmy's car drives off. Robert hobbles up the block.
SERVANT: Everything okay, sir? Robert turns, startled.
ROBERT: I'm fine, Glen. Go back to bed. The servant shuffles off.
ELLEN: ( HALF-ASLEEP )
ROBERT: ( DREAMY )
ELLEN: ( DREAMY )
ROBERT: I just went to. eat some ice cream.
ELLEN: Was it good?
ROBERT: ( pained, shifting his body ) Good. Don't forget to take your Lipitor in the morning.
ELLEN: Good. Don't forget to take your Lipitor in the morning.
ROBERT: Do you still love me?
ELLEN: Do you still love me?
ROBERT: Do you still love me?
ELLEN: Of course I do. She rolls over. Hold on Robert's face.
SYD: Hypothetically, the situation you're describing would be involuntary manslaughter.
ROBERT: And such a person.
SYD: .would be in a lot of trouble, especially if that person was closing a merger with a large public bank where any publicity or arrest could delay or derail the transaction.
ROBERT: Fingerprints, DNA?
SYD: Very hard to collect after an explosion. The real world's different from television.
ROBERT: What about cell phone records?
SYD: Did this person make any calls from the area?
ROBERT: Not from a cell phone, no.
SYD: Then they won't be able to place him there.
ROBERT: What would you advise such a person to do?
SYD: To confess immediately.
ROBERT: Failing which?
SYD: To put as much distance between himself and the event as possible, if possible. But let me tell you something, and I'm speaking to you as a friend now: there are about fifty things that person wouldn't have thought of. And the more time that passes, the more lies that are told, the worse it gets for him. Robert stands.
ROBERT: They're going to come to you. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 36.
SYD: They're going to come to you. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 36.
ROBERT: I know.
SYD: An accident's not the worst trouble. If we talk to them now we can probably work it out.
ROBERT: You tell me what happens if the Standard deal does not close, and I gotta tell my investors about our real losses?
SYD: Nothing good.
ROBERT: And what'd you say about the Justice Department? Depending on what they decide to arrest me on fraud conviction gets me twenty years?
SYD: I did.
ROBERT: ( laughs in pain ) What choice do I really have?
CHRIS: You're aware Congress plans to extend the audit requirements for private funds.
ROBERT: Of course I am aware. I gave testimony to the committee.
CHRIS: Well, Standard wants to prepare for it now. So I was asked to go through every one of your trading books and reconfirm their assets.
ROBERT: No. Absolutely not. That's impossible.
CHRIS: Don't worry. I put the team on different books and I left "Old Hill" for myself.
ROBERT: The audit's cleared?
CHRIS: The report will be issued today. Actually, I'm calling it my "swan song."
ROBERT: You're leaving?
CHRIS: Yeah, on Friday, it's a five-year clock.
ROBERT: ( EXACERBATED )
CHRIS: Uhh.. To prevent exactly what we're doing. But honestly, there's nothing left to worry about. It's great. The carphone RINGS.
ROBERT: ( TO CHRIS )
ROBERT: GAVIN ( O.S. ) The show.
ROBERT: What the fuck are you talking about?
ROBERT: Oh. Oh, it was fine. A beat as Robert rubs his eyes.
ROBERT: He's here? Where?
ROBERT: He called?
ROBERT: You think we're dealing with a fucking idiot?
ROBERT: That's being issued now.
ROBERT: Never mind that, just find out why Mayfield hasn't called us. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 39.
ROBERT: Do I have to do every Goddamn thing myself? JUST FIND OUT! WILL YOU
BROOKE: I cannot reconcile it.
ROBERT: Reconcile what?
BROOKE: The "Old Hill" Fund. Dad, are you listening to me?
ROBERT: Of course I'm listening.
BROOKE: Yeah, but look at the sheet! It can't be right. There's a four hundred million dollar hole here. I mean that can't be right.
RECEPTIONIST: May I help you? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 40.
BRYER: Detective Bryer. I was hoping to see Mr. Miller.
CINDY: Is he expecting you?
BRYER: INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
BROOKE: .the way that this sheet reads, half of the fund's assets are missing.
ROBERT: ( LAUGHS )
BROOKE: I know, it's ridiculous, and yet.
ROBERT: Okay, I'll look into it. I promise you I'll look into it. The Intercom handset RINGS.
ROBERT: ( stiffens, then into phone ) Give me two minutes, then send him in.
BROOKE: Everything alright?
ROBERT: Yes, my other meeting just got here early. We'll have to pick this up later.
BROOKE: Okay. And Mom wants to know about the hospital check?
ROBERT: Brooke, we'll pick it up later, alright? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 41.
BROOKE: Brooke exits. Robert steels himself.
ROBERT: Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. You can sit there. We just heard about it. Really terrible.
BRYER: Okay, so you were an investor in her gallery?
ROBERT: How'd you meet her?
BRYER: How'd you meet her?
ROBERT: Through. I think it was a charity function. My wife and I have a foundation.
BRYER: Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?
ROBERT: Last night, at the gallery.
BRYER: Did you stay till the doors closed?
ROBERT: No, I think I left about ten.
BRYER: Where'd you go? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 42.

BRYER: Okay. Okay, so now, back to the gallery. Did you see her with anyone?
ROBERT: See her with anyone what do you You know like a boyfriend, someone she might've left with?
BRYER: You know like a boyfriend, someone she might've left with?
ROBERT: Not that I noticed. No. No, no.
BRYER: Reason I ask, is, that we haven't located the driver.
ROBERT: The driver?
BRYER: Yeah, someone else was driving.
ROBERT: This is awful. This is truly awful.
BRYER: We're searching the area right now. So no boyfriend that you know of?
ROBERT: Actually we didn't talk about personal matters.
BRYER: She was just an employee, right?
ROBERT: Well not an employee. I was an investor.
BRYER: Why'd you invest?
ROBERT: Why did I invest?
BRYER: Yeah, why'd you invest?
ROBERT: She had a great eye. She found me
BRYER: ( after a beat ) Would you mind if we searched her apartment?
ROBERT: Why would I mind?
BRYER: It's in your company's name.
ROBERT: Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure, go ahead.
BRYER: Now, Mr. Miller.
ROBERT: Goldenrod - 4.17.11 44.
BRYER: Why would you lease an apartment for Ms. Côte? Is that something you normally do for your employees?
ROBERT: Actually I said that she wasn't an employee, but I think she'd just come over from Paris if I remember, and she needed a place to entertain buyers.
BRYER: So you leased her this apartment.
ROBERT: It was through our holding company. You seem a little confused by all I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.
BRYER: ( LAUGHS )
ROBERT: Now, I don't mean to be But you're going to be Well, from what I've been able to gather, she wasn't exactly an art star. I mean, she worked for a couple a dealers in Paris, but.
BRYER: Now, I don't mean to be But you're going to be Well, from what I've been able to gather, she wasn't exactly an art star. I mean, she worked for a couple a dealers in Paris, but.
ROBERT: But you're going to be Well, from what I've been able to gather, she wasn't exactly an art star. I mean, she worked for a couple a dealers in Paris, but.
BRYER: Well, from what I've been able to gather, she wasn't exactly an art star. I mean, she worked for a couple a dealers in Paris, but.
ROBERT: Oh, okay, I get it, so why would I invest in her and help her find a place?
BRYER: Something like that, yeah.
ROBERT: It's very simple, detective. I invest in people I believe in. I thought she'd do well, so I backed her, she did. It's is simple as that.
BRYER: ( nods, stands as Robert
STANDS ): Well that seems to make sense.
ROBERT: Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.
BRYER: Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.
ROBERT: That's a nasty cut; I've been looking at that for the last five minutes. Does it hurt you?
BRYER: That's a nasty cut; I've been looking at that for the last five minutes. Does it hurt you?
ROBERT: ( touching the cut ) Oh, no, I just hit it on the medicine cabinet.
BRYER: Last night?
ROBERT: This morning.
BRYER: Hate when that happens.
ROBERT: Yeah. Me, too.
BRYER: Well, thanks for the chat.
ROBERT: No problem. Bryer heads out. We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 46.
MAE: ( INTO PHONE )
ELLEN: ( INTO PHONE )
MAE: ( SOFTLY )
ELLEN: ( INTO PHONE )
MAE: Detective Bryer.
ELLEN: What does he want?
MAE: I don't know. Ellen smooths her suit and puts her bag over her shoulder.
ELLEN: ( heading to the door ) Well, I'm late so I just can't deal with it right now.
MAE: Okay, what about these? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 47.
ELLEN: Send them a thank you note, Zappos has been so generous Thanks, bye guys.
BRYER: ( calling after her ) Mrs. Miller?
ELLEN: ( STARTLED )
BRYER: ( shows his badge ) Detective Bryer.
ELLEN: Did you just call my office?
BRYER: Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you.
ELLEN: Well, I don't have time right now, ( turning on the charm ) Just take a couple a seconds. It's about your husband.
BRYER: ( turning on the charm ) Just take a couple a seconds. It's about your husband.
ELLEN: Well, fine, but, make an appointment. She closes the door and rides away. Bryer smiles in frustration, walks back to his car.
MILLS: How'd it go?
BRYER: Well, the wife blew me off which was interesting. And he didn't admit to the affair, but then he wouldn't, would he?
MILLS: Why didn't you pick him up?
BRYER: He's a very rich man. What happened with the pay phones? Mills pulls out a SHEET from Verizon.
MILLS: Got about fifteen calls in a three- mile. Two of `em look a little strange: got an incoming that's probably a local drug deal.
BRYER: And the one we care about?
MILLS: Collect call. About a minute and a half. Made from the Chevron station on West Lake Road.
BRYER: Who'd he call?
MILLS: Cellphone in Harlem. Still waiting on the address.
BRYER: ( thinks, gets up and
PACES ): So, you're at the crash site. Alright, and. you make it outta the car. Now. You're smart enough not to use your own cellphone. So you get to the pay Goldenrod - 4.17.11 49.
PUNCHLINE ): You call someone in Harlem?
GAVIN: ( out of breath ) Robert, I just heard about Julie. I'm so sorry. Her Gallery called. Her mom's flying in today.
ROBERT: ( managing a nod ) Her Mom.? Service here?
GAVIN: Tomorrow at nine am.
ROBERT: Well we should pick up the expenses for that. Whatever she wants. You'll take care of that personally, for me?
GAVIN: ( NODDING )
ROBERT: You reach Mayfield? The ELEVATOR arrives and Robert gets in.
GAVIN: Not yet, but we'll get him.
ROBERT: Thanks. Appreciate your concern. Gavin's still staring as the doors close.
MILLS: Let's flash him. They drive up on the sidewalk, blocking Jimmy's path, and Mills exits the car.
MILLS: Mr. Grant?
JIMMY: NYPD Homicide, would you mind stepping into the car?
MILLS: NYPD Homicide, would you mind stepping into the car?
JIMMY: What's this about?
BRYER: ( through the window ) Just get in the car, Jimmy.
JIMMY: Am I under arrest?
BRYER: ( through the window ) You wanna be?
BRYER: So let's do this again.
JIMMY: Man, for what? My answers ain't gonna change.
BRYER: You were asleep.
JIMMY: Goldenrod - 4.17.11 51.
BRYER: And your phone rings.
JIMMY: And it's a wrong number. Jimmy doesn't answer.
BRYER: And it's a wrong number. Jimmy doesn't answer.
JIMMY: I don't think I wanna answer any more questions.
BRYER: And you stay on the phone a minute and a half on a wrong number? What the fuck do you talk about, area codes?
JIMMY: I want to talk to my lawyer.
MILLS: Listen, kid, we know you went out there. We ID'd your photo with your neighbor who saw you getting into your truck ten minutes after this call was made.
JIMMY: Well if you got all that, what the fuck you need me for, officer?
BRYER: I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation here, Jimmy. This is a homicide.
JIMMY: INT. SYD'S LIMO - DAY Robert rides with Syd. He reviews a DOCUMENT entitled "MAPLE LANE TRUST - James L. Grant - Beneficiary." Robert signs the document, closing the folder.
ROBERT: You're gonna sign him out?
SYD: I called in Earl Monroe.
ROBERT: The basketball player?
SYD: Civil rights attorney. You remember Crown Heights?
ROBERT: He's the best?
SYD: He's the best above 96th Street- and that doesn't make him any cheaper. Robert slumps back, staring out the window.
ROBERT: You've gotta get Jimmy out of this.
SYD: It might not be that easy. If he doesn't cooperate they're likely to indict him on obstruction.
ROBERT: What would he be looking at?
SYD: Hard to say. With his prior. Five years, maybe ten. Robert's silent.
BRYER: ( TO JIMMY )
EARL: I'll call you tomorrow if there's any news. Don't worry about anything. And don't talk to anyone else. You take care. Jimmy nods and walks up the street towards Syd's limo in the INT. SYD'S LIMO - CONTINUOUS Come on, get in. Jimmy enters. The limo drives off.
ROBERT: Come on, get in. Jimmy enters. The limo drives off.
JIMMY: All you said was you wanted a fucking ride! You didn't tell me you killed that girl!
ROBERT: I'm trying to put my life back together. Okay, I appreciate you helped us, but now you're pushing it too far.
JIMMY: I'm trying to put my life back together. Okay, I appreciate you helped us, but now you're pushing it too far.
ROBERT: It's gonna be okay.
JIMMY: Like it was your ass sitting in there? Like you know a fucking thing about how it's gonna be?
ROBERT: We've got you the best criminal lawyer
JIMMY: Don't you got your own son for this? Why the hell you didn't call him?
ROBERT: Cause he woulda fucked it up, okay?
JIMMY: Well I'm sorry your son's a fuckin' idiot, but that ain't my fault.
SYD: This isn't productive. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 54.
JIMMY: Oh, okay. So tell us then, Syd, what happens now?
SYD: We meet with Earl and we go from there. I understand that right now they don't have enough to charge you with anything.
ROBERT: Your under suspicion.
JIMMY: Under suspicion? Motherfucker, I'm Black!
ROBERT: I am aware of that.
JIMMY: And what exactly would you like me to do about it?
SYD: ( BUZZING the driver ) Gentlemen, my driver will take you where you wanna go, but I cannot be a party to this conversation, so this is where I get out.
JIMMY: Why couldn't you have just stayed?
ROBERT: I couldn't.
JIMMY: Why not?
ROBERT: Because I have responsibilities. And if I stayed there, a lot of people would've been hurt.
JIMMY: Somebody was hurt. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 55.
ROBERT: Other people, Jimmy. I've got business troubles, you understand.? People rely on me. Jimmy chews on this, dissatisfied.
JIMMY: Yeah, I know I messed up, alright? I'm sorry. But I do want to help you, you know that. ( handing Jimmy the folder ) So I've been able to set up a situation for you.
ROBERT: Yeah, I know I messed up, alright? I'm sorry. But I do want to help you, you know that. ( handing Jimmy the folder ) So I've been able to set up a situation for you.
JIMMY: What's that?
ROBERT: It's a trust. In your name, assets of $2 Million dollars. Take a look at that.
JIMMY: ( ASTOUNDED )
ROBERT: What else is there? Jimmy laughs, then rises and knocks on the limo's partition.
JIMMY: ( to the driver ) Yo, yo man, pull over.
ROBERT: ( stares at him ) What are you gonna do? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 56.
JIMMY: I look like a fucking snitch to you?
ROBERT: I don't know, Jimmy. I don't know. Are you? Jimmy laughs in disgust, begins to open the door.
ROBERT: Yeah, put him through. ( he hears Chris come on ) CHRIS ( O.S. ) Robert, I've run into some problems. We're doing a "non-recommend."
ROBERT: ( BEWILDERED )
ROBERT: CHRIS ( O.S. ) I've gotta go.
ROBERT: Chris? CHRIS! Goddamnit, Chris! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 57.
BROOKE: ( INTO PHONE )
BEN: What are you doing in my office? Brooke bolts up, startled. She collects the papers she ( holding up pages ) Can you explain these?
BROOKE: ( holding up pages ) Can you explain these?
BEN: Explain what?
BROOKE: Old Hill. All the numbers you've falsified.
BEN: ( BEAT )
BROOKE: Get out of my way.
BEN: You're hurting my arm.
BROOKE: You're hurting my arm.
BEN: Can't you just leave it alone? She stares at him. He drops his arm. She exits and turns.
BROOKE: You're fired, Ben.
BEN: You can't fire me.
BROOKE: I just did.
BEN: Who do you think asked me to make those changes? She stares, then approaches him.
BROOKE: 83 You tell me. 83
MILLS: He was doing a little dealing a while back, but it looks like he stopped.
FLORES: Any family?
BRYER: Nah, they're all dead.
FLORES: ( READING )
BRYER: Well, he had an excellent lawyer.
FLORES: ( READING CLOSER )
BRYER: We pulled his parents' tax returns. Guess where his father worked for twenty years?
FLORES: ( READING )
MILLS: So far he won't budge.
FLORES: Well he's a convicted felon. Go get a warrant, put him in front of a grand jury. Let's see how long he holds out when he realizes he's looking at ten years off the prior.
SECRETARY: I'm sorry, Mr. Miller, as I explained from downstairs, he's on a call right now, and he said. He brushes past her. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 60.
CHRIS: What the fuck.?
ROBERT: Tell me what is going on. Robert comes closer. Chris is freaking out.
CHRIS: I can't.
ROBERT: Tell me what's going on!
CHRIS: I can't! Robert GRABS Chris by the collar.
ROBERT: Why not?!
CHRIS: It's not me!
ROBERT: What do you mean it's not.?
CHRIS: THE AUDIT PASSED! ( slackening his grip ) The audit passed? What do you mean the audit passed?
ROBERT: ( slackening his grip ) The audit passed? What do you mean the audit passed?
CHRIS: It passed! It passed a week ago! Like I said. Everything's fine! We confirmed the money, it's all straight and done.
ROBERT: ( BEYOND CONFUSED )
CHRIS: Because they asked me to hold it.
ROBERT: They? Who's they? ( thrashes him again ) Who is they?!
CHRIS: ( TO HIMSELF )
ROBERT: ( TO HIMSELF )
CHRIS: They're negotiating. He wants a better price.
ROBERT: They're negotiating. He wants a better price.
ROBERT: ( INTO PHONE )
DEFERLITO: .cause it's not gonna hold.
BRYER: The warrant doesn't need to hold. It just needs to scare him into giving up Miller. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 62.
DEFERLITO: What is it, Mike, you're stalled- out mid-career so you're reaching for a high-note? Who gives a fuck?
BRYER: This is about Judge Rittenband, isn't it? It's cause he's running again?
DEFERLITO: You wanna cost the Judge his seat on a profiling claim? Against Earl Monroe?
BRYER: ( SWITCHING TACKS )
DEFERLITO: Good, then come back when you got it.
BRYER: I'll have it before you go in the jury room. Look, Ray. We like this kid. I don't wanna lose him. Think about it: if we flip him, you get Robert Miller. What's that worth to Rittenband, and to you for that matter.?
DEFERLITO: You better not fuck me. He walks off. Bryer holds a beat, then pulls out his CELL.
BRYER: ( INTO PHONE )
CINDY: Brooke's waiting for you.
ROBERT: Did we have a meeting?
CINDY: No, but she looked upset.
ROBERT: ( APPROACHING HER )
ROBERT: You wanna sit?
BROOKE: I'll stand. ( as he sits ) Didn't you think I'd find out?
ROBERT: I did.
BROOKE: Then why didn't you tell me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 64.
ROBERT: Because I hoped you wouldn't.
BROOKE: Oh, come on. You tell me the truth now or I am done.
ROBERT: I made a bad bet.
BROOKE: No, you committed fraud.
ROBERT: That's a dangerous word, Brooke.
BROOKE: What would you prefer? That you cheated? That you stole money from people who trusted you? That you lied? That you lied right to my face? Why?
ROBERT: Because we were going broke! Everything was finished. We'd have How. How does that happen?
BROOKE: How. How does that happen?
ROBERT: You remember Alexanderov? Well he came to see me one day last year. He said "Robert, we've got a great opportunity- there's a copper mine, it's in Russia, it's under- exploited- there's billions under the ground, and to get it out, all we need is a couple hundred million, you put in a hundred, we'll put in a hundred- we'll triple it all in six months." So, I go check it out. And the geological survey's right, friendly government. And to lock it in, you hedge it, right? Sell the copper ahead on the commodities exchange and it all works, it's fine, and you're making a fortune.
BROOKE: Until it's not. The money's trapped. You can't get it out. Probably never will.
ROBERT: Until it's not. The money's trapped. You can't get it out. Probably never will.
BROOKE: Well it does not just happen.
ROBERT: Not just happen, honey you are so naive sometimes. It HAPPENS. And like every father I pray that it doesn't HAPPEN to you, which, thanks to me, it probably won't happen to you.
BROOKE: Thanks to you, we may all be arrested.
ROBERT: Nobody's getting arrested. That's why I borrowed the money from Jeffrey. Plug the hole, I put it there for a month, they see the books are fine, I transfer the company, I pay back Jeffrey with interest! make all of our investors whole, and what's left we keep. At least we get to keep the house.
BROOKE: Everybody wins?
ROBERT: If the company sells. If I lie for you.
BROOKE: If the company sells. If I lie for you.
ROBERT: You don't have to lie. You didn't know about it.
BROOKE: ( INCREDULOUS )
ROBERT: What did you want me to do? Did you want me to let our investors go bankrupt? Is that what you wanted? For people to get really hurt?
BROOKE: What. gives you the audacity to think you can make those decisions?
ROBERT: ( STANDS )
BROOKE: No, it's illegal. It's illegal. And I am your partner.
ROBERT: You are not my partner! You work for me! ( off her bewildered stare ) That's right. You work for me!
BROOKE: ( stares a while, then ) For a moment I thought you were gonna say you were sorry. She walks off. Hold on Robert alone in the park.
ROBERT: ( SOTTO )
JIMMY: ( SEEING BRYER )
BRYER: Jimmy, take a ride with me.
JIMMY: Where? Back to the station?
BRYER: No man, just get in the car.
JIMMY: What if I say no? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 68.
BRYER: I'm not threatening you. I'm just asking you take a ride with me. Jimmy considers, gets into Bryer's car.
JIMMY: Alright, man, what?
BRYER: Look, it's pretty fuckin' simple. I know you went to pick him up.
JIMMY: This is what you wanna talk about? I told you I ain't makin' no more statements.
BRYER: And I know why.
JIMMY: Somebody cares?
BRYER: Take a look at this. ( hands him a case folder ) I've got his phone calls, I got his text messages. I've got the relationship with the girl. And they were fucking, by the And then I've got you. I've got the time log from the pay phone. I've a got a fucking tollbooth photograph of you driving your car through the Triborough. Jimmy thumbs through the FOLDER. There's no tollbooth PHOTO.
JIMMY: Where you got that.? That's bullshit, cause I didn't do it. That's impossible.
BRYER: Jimmy's silent.
JIMMY: Talk to Earl, Detective.
BRYER: Fuck Earl! You see this? ( holds up the grand jury
DOCKET ): This means that tomorrow, grand jury hears your case in court. And tomorrow in court I'm gonna ask for a felony obstruction indictment, and with with your prior, you are going to prison for fifteen fucking years. You might get out in ten. You'll be what then? Thirty-three, with no job, no girl, no life. Bryer pulls the car over.
JIMMY: Who's Miller?
BRYER: I know about your father.
JIMMY: ( beat, then hard ) You don't know a Goddamn thing about my father.
BRYER: I know Miller paid his bills while he was dying. I know he got Syd Felder to get you out of trouble on your gun charge. That doesn't add up to this.
JIMMY: You done?
BRYER: Okay, he's driving, he crashes- he runs away- who does he call? Calls you. Why do you think that is?
JIMMY: ( tries to open the locked door ) Will you open the door?
BRYER: So what, what? You're his new nigger now? Jimmy grabs at the door violently. It's locked.
JIMMY: Open OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!
BRYER: You didn't kill that girl. He did.
JIMMY: ( containing his rage ) Will you open the door?
BRYER: He's using you. I know it - you know it. Do the right thing. Now get outta my fuckin' car. Bryer unlocks the door. Jimmy exits and walks up the block.
SYD: He's gonna walk.
ROBERT: You're certain?
SYD: Courts aren't for certainty, but he says he was at home, why shouldn't he be? A phone call doesn't make him a liar. ( off Robert's nod ) But what's baffling to me, though, despite your sentimental history together, is why you would put your family's future in this kid's hands. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 71.
ROBERT: ( BEAT )
SYD: Is that a good thing?
ROBERT: ( laughs, plays with his
SYD: How's Ellen?
ROBERT: She's good. Fine. ( stops packing, looks up ) I heard something.
SYD: I heard something.
ROBERT: She met with Gil Deuchman.
SYD: She met with Gil Deuchman.
ROBERT: The estate lawyer?
SYD: Yeah. Has she mentioned anything?
ROBERT: Not to me. They sit in silence.
DEFERLITO: That was the early morning of April 11th.
JIMMY: Goldenrod - 4.17.11 72.
DEFERLITO: You received a phone call?
JIMMY: Who called you? Jimmy stares at DeFerlito.
DEFERLITO: Who called you? Jimmy stares at DeFerlito.
JIMMY: It was a wrong number.
DEFERLITO: That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant?
JIMMY: You stayed on the phone one-and-a- half minutes. Mr. Grant, isn't it the case that you know exactly who called you and exactly why? Why are you lying to this court?
DEFERLITO: You stayed on the phone one-and-a- half minutes. Mr. Grant, isn't it the case that you know exactly who called you and exactly why? Why are you lying to this court?
JIMMY: I'm not lying. DeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table. He picks up a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to a CLERK.
DEFERLITO: I'm going to introduce into evidence People's A. This is a toll booth photograph taken in the northbound ninth lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant, directing your attention to the photograph, would you please read the date and time stamp indicated on the lower right hand corner? Jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief.
JIMMY: This is crazy.
EARL: ( whispers in Jimmy's ear ) You're gonna have to answer that.
DEFERLITO: Mr. Grant, please answer the question. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 73.
JIMMY: April 11th, two thirty-three am.
DEFERLITO: Mr. Grant, directing your attention to the same photograph, would you please read the license plate number of the vehicle passing through the toll?
JIMMY: D D G five five four two.
DEFERLITO: ( handing in another sheet ) This is People's B, a printout from the Department of Motor Vehicles plate registry. Mr. Grant, directing your attention to that printout, are those numbers on the toll photograph the same ones that are on your own license plate? Jimmy's still staring at the picture. Earl watches, concerned.
JIMMY: Yes, the numbers are the same?
DEFERLITO: Yes, the numbers are the same?
JIMMY: How do you explain that?
DEFERLITO: How do you explain that?
JIMMY: I can't.
DEFERLITO: But that is your car in this photograph, isn't it?
JIMMY: No, that is not your car? ( off his silence ) Answer the question, Mr. Grant. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 74.
DEFERLITO: No, that is not your car? ( off his silence ) Answer the question, Mr. Grant. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 74.
JIMMY: This is not my car in this picture. I don't know how you all did that, but this is not my car.
DEFERLITO: You expect this grand jury to believe that that is not your car when there is a printout from the department of motor vehicles.
EARL: That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.
DEFERLITO: Mr. Monroe, you are aware that you're not permitted to go on record.
EARL: Jimmy. Jimmy what was that?
JIMMY: They're lying!
EARL: Okay, now here's what. Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over to them.
BRYER: I can halt the decision.
EARL: We need a minute, Detective.
BRYER: What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute? Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.
JIMMY: You can get the fuck outta my face. How `bout that?. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 75.
BRYER: So you wanna keep playing games? Or you ready to tell me something?
EARL: Detective, I need to talk to my client. Now if you would just please.
JIMMY: How you- How you all just gonna lie like that? Huh? How you all just gonna lie?!
BRYER: We didn't lie. You lied.
JIMMY: That wasn't my car.
EARL: .Jimmy, don't say anything else.
BRYER: Sure it wasn't. And it was a telemarketer called you from the pay phone? He stopped at the Chevron to make a late night sale?
JIMMY: That picture was some bullshit.
EARL: .Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's going on?
BRYER: Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy. Tell him. See how the boss'll like this one. Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.
EARL: ( rising, to Jimmy ) Wait here. Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.
ASSISTANT: Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce you to Julie's mom, Sandrine. A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert approaches as she stands.
ROBERT: I am so, so sorry.
SANDRINE: ( nods, then ) I just wanted to thank you for what you did for my daughter.
ROBERT: ( shaking his head softly ) You believed in her, and you gave her a chance. She was happy. I know she was happy.
SANDRINE: You believed in her, and you gave her a chance. She was happy. I know she was happy.
ROBERT: It's just.
ELLEN: .she's rail thin. She's a blond. I would not have known who she was if she hadn't come up and introduced herself to me. She looked totally different. and. ( notices Brooke increasing the machine's resistance ) You're going straight to level six don't you think you better pace yourself a little bit?
BROOKE: ( fakes a smile ) I'm good. I wanna run.
ELLEN: Everything okay with you and Tom?
BROOKE: We're fine.
ELLEN: Are you worried about the deal closing?
BROOKE: ( STRIDES FASTER )
ELLEN: You want me to guess?
BROOKE: ( heading to pick up her
BELONGINGS ): You know, I can't stay for breakfast I have to just. I have to get in to work, I don't know what I was thinking.
ELLEN: ( A BEAT )
BROOKE: Did he write the check?
ELLEN: Did he write the check?
BROOKE: Ellen stops her machine.
ELLEN: Why not?
BROOKE: Issues related to the closing.
ELLEN: We don't lie to each other, Brooke.
BROOKE: I'm not lying to you. It's complicated; you wouldn't understand. Ellen crosses closer to Brooke blocking her exit.
ELLEN: ( A BEAT )
BROOKE: I honestly have no idea.
ELLEN: What about your father's head- where he cut his head and the pain that he's hiding in his stomach and, now ( starts to tear ) For some reason that's way to complicated for me to understand, there's no money for a routine gift? Does that seem a little strange to you?
BROOKE: Of course it's strange.
ELLEN: So tell me what's happening. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 79.
BROOKE: ( A BEAT )
ELLEN: No. You have to do what's right for you. Not him, not me, not anyone. This is your life. Ellen grabs Brooke and hugs her hard. Brooke hugs back, kissing her mother on the cheek, tearing.
BROOKE: ( WHISPERS )
ELLEN: ( SOTTO )
ROBERT: You keep sending people to my office to "do business."
MAYFIELD: They're just getting acquainted.
ROBERT: With the intricacies of my operation so that you can. not buy it? ( to a waitress as he sits ) Just coffee, please.
MAYFIELD: You remember what it was like on our side of the fence. Everything just moves. a little slower. Plus this whole audit mess doesn't help. You know, clearing that all up.
ROBERT: Fuck you. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 80.
MAYFIELD: Excuse me.?
ROBERT: FUCK - YOU. I'm the Oracle of Gracie Square. You came to me. I did not come to you.
MAYFIELD: Robert, I think we're getting off on the wrong foot.
ROBERT: No, no, no. Forget it, forget it. Forget the deal. I don't even care about the deal. No, I run a comfortable excuse me I run a THRIVING business, that has returned year-to-date 15.4% percent to our investors, or approximately $583 Million dollars from a trading operation that you don't have and that we both know that you need, or else you never would've called me in the first place. You on the other hand, you've taken a salary of 18 Million? And what have you delivered? A falling stock price of negative 14 dollars? Is that what it is? You've also lost approximately. THREE AND
NEED YOU?: Let's just calm down.
MAYFIELD: Let's just calm down.
ROBERT: .so we issue a press release today, say there is no deal, never was a deal. You're not gonna be buying Old Hill, you're not gonna be buying Quantum- you're not gonna be buying anything; You? You're just a browser. Now, me? I'll continue to enjoy my earnings, and while I SOAR on princely wings, to my next winning enterprise, your stock drops another couple bucks on yet another - failed - acquisition - attempt. Bodes well for your tenure, doesn't it?
MAYFIELD: Your price is too high. Robert stands.
ROBERT: You have a nice day, James.
MAYFIELD: ( QUICKLY )
ROBERT: Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no?
MAYFIELD: Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no?
ROBERT: Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no?
MAYFIELD: ( extending his hand ) It's a deal.
ROBERT: ( GRASPING IT )
MAYFIELD: And you're gonna have to make my son a VP.
ROBERT: And you're gonna have to make my son a VP.
MAYFIELD: ( LAUGHS )
ROBERT: No, no. He doesn't have to do anything, he just gets the salary, he gets the office. Both of `em on five-year employment contracts, and my lawyers draft them. Yes or no?
MAYFIELD: Goldenrod - 4.17.11 82. Robert pulls out a pen and jots down the deal points they have just outlined onto the paper menu.
ROBERT: I'm writing the deal.
MAYFIELD: Are you serious?
ROBERT: ( ripping off the tablecloth ) I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it. Mayfield thinks a moment, then reaches over and signs the menu. Robert does the same and then folds it into his pocket.
MAYFIELD: I'll send over a draft of the press release. As Robert stands to go, he clutches his bruised rib.
ROBERT: I'm fine. Before I go how much would you have paid.?
MAYFIELD: Six hundred. And you would've taken.?
ROBERT: Four seventy-five.
MAYFIELD: So we made a good deal.
ROBERT: ( as he heads away ) Robert turns back to the table.
ROBERT: .Anyway I will be seeing most of you at the gala tomorrow night. But as the sale's official as of this afternoon, you are now free to talk about it. Any questions?
PETER: ( JOVIAL )
ROBERT: ( NODS )
GAVIN: ( SOTTO )
ROBERT: I met his price. I just took it out of your share.
GAVIN: Good work.
ROBERT: Good work.
GAVIN: Good work.
ROBERT: Well, thank you. Now go get me that fucking hospital check. Gavin walks off. Robert's cell RINGS.
JIMMY: You want something to drink?
ROBERT: What you got?
JIMMY: Not much.
ROBERT: You got any milk?
JIMMY: I'll take a water. Jimmy starts running the tap. Robert notices the moving BOXES.
ROBERT: I'll take a water. Jimmy starts running the tap. Robert notices the moving BOXES.
JIMMY: The boxes.
ROBERT: The boxes.
JIMMY: I was planning on Virginia, but it looks like I'm not going anymore. Jimmy returns with the water. Robert take a drink.
ROBERT: I told you not to take the toll.
JIMMY: Yes, you did.
ROBERT: I said "Listen to what I have to tell you and follow my directions, listen to me closely, do the following just like I say."
JIMMY: Yes. You said all that.
ROBERT: But you took the toll anyway.
JIMMY: No, I did not.
ROBERT: Come on, Jimmy, don't fucking lie to me.
JIMMY: I'm not lying! I took ninety-five all the Goddamn way there. I did what you said: I didn't stop. I didn't take the Triborough. I followed all your fucking instructions.
ROBERT: So where'd they get the photograph from?
JIMMY: You tell me.
ROBERT: So, you're saying. it's a fake?
JIMMY: How'd you get so fuckin' rich again?
ROBERT: Don't be such a wiseass.
JIMMY: Hey, this is my fuckin' life, man! Earl's telling me it could be ten years? Ten fucking years! How much are ten years worth, Robert?
ROBERT: ( as Jimmy sits ) What plan?
JIMMY: I got money saved up; I'm buying a business.
ROBERT: What business?
JIMMY: I bought an Applebee's.
ROBERT: What's an Applebee's?
JIMMY: It's a fucking restaurant, man, it's a chain restaurant.
ROBERT: You bought an Applebee's in Virginia?
JIMMY: Is this really what you came here to talk about? What are you gonna do?
ROBERT: ( SITS )
JIMMY: What situation?
ROBERT: I told you. right now, if I were to speak, a lot of people would get hurt. Jobs, families. A lot of innocent people. Do you think you can understand that?
JIMMY: Yeah but what about me? What about my They showed me pictures, man; that's fucked up what you did.
ROBERT: ( SOTTO )
JIMMY: And yeah, I know, all the people counting on you, whatever, but you told me Earl was gonna make this right. Now you know I care about you, all the things you did for us, and for my father, but Earl said they're offering me a deal, no charges at all. I walk away. They just want to know who I went to pick up.
ROBERT: ( LEANS FORWARD )
JIMMY: Alright, man, but Earl said the deal's on the table for twenty-four hours. After that, they're filing the case, and Earl says we're gonna lose.
ROBERT: ( nods, stands ) Alright I hear you. I'll be back with you as soon as I can. Just hang with me a little bit. Jimmy nods. Robert walks out. Reina crosses back into the living room as he approaches the door and exits.
REINA: You gotta give him up.
JIMMY: You said take the money.
REINA: That was to keep quiet, not to go away.
JIMMY: What can he offer me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 88. Reina crosses to Jimmy and hugs him as he starts to cry, then wipes away his tears.
ROBERT: He says he didn't take the toll.
ROBERT: ( after a beat ) Does Standard have clawback?
ROBERT: Let's just say I decide to go in.
ROBERT: No, just listen, listen to me. If I were to surrender, now, could they roll back the deal?
ROBERT: Four years, you think?
ROBERT: ( BEAT )
ROBERT: ( INTO PHONE )
BRENT: Hi I'm Brent Owens, the night supervisor. How can I help you?
EARL: ( handing him some papers ) Hello, Brent. I'm Earl Monroe. I'm executing a criminal evidence request. I need to get a look at one of your lane tapes. Brent looks over the papers, confused.
BRENT: I don't understand. This says you want to look at a tape made ten minutes ago.?
ROBERT: ( holding up his hand ) Wait. Wait. Just wait. 121 Syd slumps back. They keep staring at nothing. 121 A RAPPING noise on the window startles Syd, who rolls it down, sees Earl, and opens the door. Earl climbs inside, removing a FOLIO from his breast pocket as he talks.
EARL: Okay, they won't release tapes without a court order, but they did give me a print out, the same kind they used at Jimmy's indictment. Earl reaches inside the folio and removes the PHOTOGRAPH he got from the toll authority. He lays it on the counter. It's from a toll camera, showing his car and license plate. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 91.
ROBERT: ( TO EARL )
RITTENBAND: Well they look a little different to me, too. Is there a reason you haven't allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to conduct his own analysis? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 92.
DEFERLITO: We've had some issues regarding .You don't have them anymore. You're to meet him with the evidence in the next hour.
RITTENBAND: .You don't have them anymore. You're to meet him with the evidence in the next hour.
DEFERLITO: I'm afraid that's not possible. A beat.
RITTENBAND: Where's the tape?
BRYER: Your honor.
RITTENBAND: It seems there's been.
DEFERLITO: It seems there's been.
RITTENBAND: .Let him tell me.
BRYER: We don't know where it is.
RITTENBAND: Come again?
BRYER: It's not in the evidence locker.
RITTENBAND: Where is it?
BRYER: We don't know. Silence. Rittenband leans forward.
RITTENBAND: I'll ask you one last time, detective. Where is the tape?
BRYER: ( after a beat ) We lost it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 93.
RITTENBAND: Hmmm. In light of these developments, and I would think you should be very happy to hear this, with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going to offer Mr. Deferlito the opportunity to voluntarily dismiss the indictment to save us all a bunch of embarrassment.
DEFERLITO: I don't feel comfortable with that, your honor.
RITTENBAND: Further I'm going to put all charges against Mr. Grant under seal. ( Bryer starts heading to
EARL: Thank you. Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.
RITTENBAND: Close the door, detective, Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.
BRYER: I'm sorry?
RITTENBAND: .You finessed it. I know it, and you know it. No response. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 94.
BRYER: Oh, okay. ( approaches the judge ) So let me get this straight: What you're telling me is I'm supposed to sit around with my thumb up my ass and my fingers crossed hoping that one of these fucking days, somewhere down the line, one of these rich assholes is gonna say the wrong thing LOUD enough so that we can't choose to ignore it anymore?
RITTENBAND: ( BEAT )
BRYER: Yes, your honor.
BRYER: ( on the phone ) Well when do you expect her.? When do you expect her? Okay, well so I don't have to call a ninth time, will you take down what I'm sayin', word for word.? Okay, you got a pencil? You ready? Okay, here goes: "Mrs. Miller- Exactly how fuckin' stupid do you really think I am?"
ROBERT: You didn't hurt anybody. You helped a lot of people. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 95.
JIMMY: And this piece of paper makes everything okay?
ROBERT: No, it makes it easier.
JIMMY: ( BEAT )
ROBERT: Jimmy keeps staring at the document.
JIMMY: Robert, look: you asked me to come meet you and I'm here, but I came because I wanted to get something straight between us: we're even.
ROBERT: Okay, we're even. But just for the record though, what you did. ( picks up the trust document ) Was way beyond the money.
JIMMY: ( LAUGHS )
ROBERT: ( LAUGHS BACK )
JIMMY: ( pointing to the document ) And if I take this, then what does that say about me? He thinks a moment, then folds the document and puts it in his pocket.
ROBERT: Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna get there.? I don't wanna get there too soon. She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then.
ELLEN: You spoke to Brooke? He slows. Something's brewing.
ROBERT: Did she tell you that?
ELLEN: No. She didn't have to.
ROBERT: Yeah, I explained to Brooke that.
ELLEN: .you explained, did you?
ROBERT: ( off his silence ) Lift up your shirt.
ELLEN: ( off his silence ) Lift up your shirt.
ROBERT: Lift up your shirt. He doesn't move. She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib. He winces a little, then looks down at the floor. It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 97.
ELLEN: Lift up your shirt. He doesn't move. She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib. He winces a little, then looks down at the floor. It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 97.
ROBERT: ( LONG BEAT )
ELLEN: Oh, don't treat me like an idiot. You've been sneaking off to see her for months. You don't think I know that?
ROBERT: What do you think you know?
ELLEN: I never cared, really, about your secretaries, your- gallerists, whores, whatever you wanna call them. I cared about our home. And now you have brought this to our door.
ROBERT: I did what was necessary.
ELLEN: No you did what was necessary for you, Robert, for your interests.
ROBERT: For my interests?
ELLEN: Everything I do is for us, for this family, and now you're gonna tell me how to run my business.
ROBERT: Everything I do is for us, for this family, and now you're gonna tell me how to run my business.
ELLEN: This isn't about your business, this is our life! Where do you think we're going tonight? Why do you think I've even tolerated this for so long?
ROBERT: ( he's had enough ) What you've tolerated? Wow!
ELLEN: I'm glad you find that funny.
ROBERT: What about me? What about the complaints? The unhappiness? The drinking? The shopping? The trainers? Everything! But yes, the charities, the wonderful sainted charities, you know, all the wonderful works that you do. How do you think I've paid for them?
ELLEN: I didn't ask you because I didn't want you to lie.
ROBERT: ( WALKS OFF )
ELLEN: But I thought that we had an understanding. And you broke that understanding when you brought Brooke into it.
ROBERT: No, I kept her out.
ELLEN: When you made Brooke complicit when you risked her future and I'm done. She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides them toward him.
ROBERT: What is this?
ELLEN: Read it. He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a few brief seconds until.
ROBERT: "All ownership and voting rights transfer to the Miller Charitable Foundation, to be administered by Brooke Miller?" Did you really expect me to sign this thing?
ELLEN: You're not following. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 99.
ROBERT: Apparently not, no. No.
ELLEN: ( like talking to a child ) Okay, uhm, the police have been trying to talk me. I assume they want to know where you were that night. And you know what? I'm not gonna lie for you anymore. Not unless you sign that. A beat.
ROBERT: Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.
ELLEN: I think you'll find a way to manage. I'm sure you have all kinds of things offshore for a rainy day.
ROBERT: ( SHAKES HEAD )
ELLEN: ( FAST )
ROBERT: You're out of your mind. I am not signing that. I will not sign that!
ELLEN: Well then. I'll have to tell them that you came home at four-thirty bruised and bleeding.
ROBERT: ( LAUGHS )
ELLEN: I think we call it negotiating. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 100.
ROBERT: You're not gonna win that one. There's no fucking way.
ELLEN: You know what, it'll cause just enough trouble- the kind of trouble that you don't want In fact, according to my lawyer
ROBERT: ( PACES )
ELLEN: It's enough to give them probable cause and then they can subpoena your cell phone, GPS, DNA,
ROBERT: Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!
ELLEN: And whatever else they can think of. So really Robert what you have is a choice: you can spend the next three years in court and in the tabloids or you can be at your business.
ROBERT: ( SHAKES HEAD )
ELLEN: Just try me. He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.
ROBERT: It's how it all works, Ellen. You know that.
ELLEN: I do, but she didn't.
ROBERT: She'll be better for it. The world is cold. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 101.
ELLEN: ( turns and heads out ) Then you're gonna need a warm coat. We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."
AIMES: There's just one more thing. And I hate to mention it now, but I just received it.
MAYFIELD: Speak, John. Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.
AIMES: I had Stern Marling run a secondary audit on the Miller financials. We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads: "STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412 We hold on Mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the spreading realization.
MAYFIELD: Who authorized this?
AIMES: I did.
MAYFIELD: ( after a beat ) And what did you conclude?
AIMES: It's in front of you.
MAYFIELD: ( LAUGHS )
AIMES: ( after a beat, carefully ) Well. what do you think?
MAYFIELD: I think. I think. that I don't see anything wrong here. Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his papers. Aimes nods.
BROOKE: .and to receive this prestigious award, I invite now to the stage the man who led this generous effort, and whose financial trading firm, Miller Capital, has just this morning been acquired by Standard Bank and Trust, a dedicated businessman, family man, scholar, philanthropist and all-around humanitarian, a man I am lucky to call my mentor, my friend and my father Mr. Robert Miller. Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug, takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.
