AUTHORS ANONYMOUS: Written by David Congalton
REVISED: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY
ALAN: We thought this was going to be a reality series.
COLETTE: You know, like the Kardashians.
ALAN: Oh. Really? A documentary? This is going to be a documentary about our writing group?
COLETTE: The whole group. Not just us, right? Not that it should be just about
ALAN: They look at each other: A documentary? They try to mask their disappointment.
COLETTE: So this is going to be likelike what I saw the other night on cable? About bees mating.
ALAN: Or that, um, that one about the
COLETTE: Powerful. Yes. Powerful.
ALAN: Powerful. Yes. Powerful.
COLETTE: We love documentaries.
ALAN: We do.
ALAN: Well? Comments?
HANNAH: I really like the way Yuri is developing, Colette.
COLETTE: You do?
JOHN: Well, if you ask John K. Butzin.
ALAN: I was bothered by that, too. Why would Natasha betray a reliable, dependable husband for a washed-up young punk?
COLETTE: Oh. Well.um.um.
ALAN: Poodles. It's OK.
COLETTE: No. It's not OK. I still can't explain Natasha's motive. What's the use? I'm not a writer.
WILLIAM: Whoa. Whoa. Time out. The dude's good in bed. Trust me, that's all the motive she needs.
JOHN: Roger that. Torpedo Chapter Three. Blow it up. Get the focus back on this broadNatasha.
HENRY: Yes. I was thinking the same thing.
HANNAH: Make it clear that Natasha wants to be closer.
COLETTE: Who wants coffee?
WILLIAM: Lend me ten bucks? I'm having cash flow issues.
HENRY: Thanks, bro'. You're the best.
WILLIAM: Thanks, bro'. You're the best.
HANNAH: What do you think? On or off? Do they make me look smarter? I need a new pair.
WILLIAM: What do you want to know about me? I'm 27. Single. A virgin.
HANNAH: I've always had this knack for telling stories. Ever since I was a kid.
MAUREEN: She's a natural.
HANNAH: Moved here. Took a couple writing classes. Decided to go for it. 24/7. Total dedication to my craft. The writing always comes first. My latest effort is called Sleeping on the Moon. It's about rejection. And pain. Not really about the moon itself. More of a.
MAUREEN: 18 INT. RESTAURANT #1 - DAY 18
HANNAH: 18 INT. RESTAURANT #1 - DAY 18
WILLIAM: So. LA? I'm here because of Bukowski. Charles Bukowski. Greatest writer ever. Period.
HANNAH: My favorite writer? Favorite writer. Favorite writer.
MAUREEN: Jane Austen.
HANNAH: That's the one. I hear she's good. But my favorite writer? Let me think about that a bit, OK?
JOHN: Everything John K. Butzin knows about writing comes down to two simple words: Tom Clancy. Yes, sir. Tom Clancy. The man's a genius. Does his research. All those nitty-gritty technical details. Now that's writing! John K. Butzin has one agent very interested in Roaring Lion. And a publisher up in Oxnard is looking at it as we speak. Plus a certain cousin's best friend has a neighbor who has an in with Clint Eastwood, so Hollywood might be calling soon. Don't know how the other members of the writing group will handle all this success by one person. They better not be pussies.
ALAN: Well, I'm an optometrist in Glendale.
COLETTE: And I write full-time.
ALAN: Our last name's Mooney. You could call us Mooneys. We get that joke all the time.
COLETTE: Alan likes to tease.
ALAN: Colette, here, is the real writer. I'm more of an idea guy. I come up with great ideas, but don't always follow through. I'll show you.
COLETTE: This is where I come for inspiration. I believe a writer must have quiet and solitude. I'll meditate. Write in my journal. Set out my creative path for the day. This is my Walden
COLETTE: Oh, this? I keep Oprah out here for luck. She's done so much to help writers. I know I'm going to be on her television show one day. I just know it.
HENRY: Tonight's the night. I'm going to ask Hannah out.
ALAN: I'm the group leader. After all, getting together was my idea. They're all my patients. That's how we met. First one published gets a free eye
JOHN: ( To William ) How come we never chow down at your This is my place. Close to the working
WILLIAM: This is my place. Close to the working
HENRY: Where's Hannah? Anyone know?
ALAN: Time to get started.
HENRY: Shouldn't we wait for Hannah?
WILLIAM: Let's go, people. I'm ready to read.
ALAN: William's right. We'll start. She'll show up.
COLETTE: William, aren't these the same pages you read last time?
WILLIAM: Nope, they're different.
JOHN: They look the same.
WILLIAM: They're different. I changed a word.
HENRY: One word?
COLETTE: That's it?
WILLIAM: Writing is rewriting, Colette. Bukowski said, "Write five words. Rewrite seven."
HENRY: No. Dorothy Parker said that.
JOHN: One word? Jesus H. Christ.
WILLIAM: It's my creative vision, John.
ALAN: ( Jumping in ) Which we are here to support. This is William's decision.
WILLIAM: Let me just read. See if you can pick out the word. Tell me if it's better, or worse.
JOHN: ( Muttering ) One goddamn word.
HENRY: I wonder what happened to Hannah.
ALAN: It's not like her to miss.
HANNAH: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for missing the meeting.
JOHN: What happened? Your car break down?
ALAN: You oversleep?
COLETTE: Maureen. Is Maureen OK?
WILLIAM: People. C'mon. Look at her. That glow. Hannah met a guy. She got
HANNAH: As a matter of fact, I did meet a Told ya.
WILLIAM: Told ya.
HANNAH: His name's Brian.
WILLIAM: Bet Brian wants more than that.
COLETTE: That's so great, Hannah.
JOHN: I salute you, young lady.
ALAN: Yes. Fantastic. Fanntasstic.
ALAN: ( Raising cup ) To Hannah!
HANNAH: Thank you. But I just want to remind everyone that we're all in this together. I couldn't have come this far without the group.
ALAN: ( Smiling ) All for one . . . . I'm merely the first one to get signed. But we're all going to have an agent soon.
HANNAH: I'm merely the first one to get signed. But we're all going to have an agent soon.
JOHN: Well, as a matter of fact, there's an agent in Santa Monica very interested in John K. Butzin. He's reading the manuscript as we speak.
WILLIAM: ( Lower voice ) Hey, can you lend me ten bucks?
HENRY: Thanks, bro'. You're the best.
WILLIAM: Thanks, bro'. You're the best.
ALAN: Congratulations again, Hannah!
COLETTE: Yes, yes. Way to go, Hannah!
HANNAH: ( Calling back ) Thank you! 'Night.
ALAN: Well, Hannah's got an agent.
COLETTE: She must have slept with him.
ALAN: Of course she did.
HENRY: I'm so proud of you, Hannah.
HANNAH: Your turn will come, Henry. You're a better writer than I am. So much better. You went to college.
HENRY: Listen. Maybe some afternoon we could go for a drive. There are some special places I'd like to show Sure. I can't believe I've lived out here four years and haven't seen
HANNAH: Sure. I can't believe I've lived out here four years and haven't seen
HENRY: Four years. It's been four years since I moved here. And now I have an agent. It's the number four again. My lucky number. I should have known this was going to happen.
HANNAH: Four years. It's been four years since I moved here. And now I have an agent. It's the number four again. My lucky number. I should have known this was going to happen.
HENRY: There is no one more deserving. I'm going to dedicate my novel to
HANNAH: I'm going to dedicate my novel to
HENRY: I'm happy for Hannah.
COLETTE: My novel is called Nyet, Not Yet. It's about a Russian woman who comes to this country in search of love. It was inspired by a story I heard from one of my massage clients, Yuri. Yes, it's trueI used to do massage. In fact, that's how I met Alan, though I certainly didn't give him the kind of massage he really wanted. At least not the first time.
HANNAH: Have I thought of my favorite author yet? No. Not yet. There are so many, you know?
COLETTE: Hi.Hi.Hello everyone. I was just in the neighborhood and
HANNAH: Colette. What a lovely surprise!
COLETTE: Oh. It's nothing. I just had to say "Congratulations" to my new favorite author.
MAUREEN: ( Reading ) "For Poodles.Now may we have sex again? Love, Alan."
HANNAH: So sweet of you, Colette.
COLETTE: My pleasure. Say, Hannah.about your agent?
HANNAH: Gee. I don't really know.
COLETTE: Think you could ask?
HANNAH: I guess so. Maybe.
COLETTE: Because if he is.
HANNAH: Let's talk about this at group meeting, OK?
COLETTE: Oh. Of course. Of course.
MAUREEN: Colette Mooney. My, that woman is something else.
HANNAH: ( To herself; counting Colette Mooney. C-o-l-e-t-t-e M-o-o-
HANNAH: Thanks for seeing me today, Alan.
ALAN: No problemo. Let's get you some new eye wear.
HANNAH: Something that makes me look smart.
HENRY: You're already smart, Hannah.
ALAN: How about.
HANNAH: Alan removes the brown-colored frames. Studies them for a second. Then inspiration arrives.
ALAN: Excuse me. One sec.
HANNAH: Of course he would.
ALAN: You know this great idea for a novel hit me this morning. It's called
HANNAH: Could be a winner.
HENRY: You look great, Hannah.
ALAN: Question: You think your agent might be interested in this idea? Does he have a dog?
HANNAH: ( Evading ) Oh. I don't know
ALAN: How about a cat? It could be a cat.
HANNAH: Um. Sure. Probably could be.
ALAN: Think about mentioning it to your agent, OK? Unleashed. Dog or cat becomes human.
HENRY: I'll help you develop the idea, Alan.
JOHN: Meet someone very s-p-e-c-i-e-l. Here with us today all the way from.
SIGRID: Oh! That accent! Found her working at the hardware store. Went in for a drill bit. Came out with a prime candidate for Mrs. John K. Butzin.
JOHN: Oh! That accent! Found her working at the hardware store. Went in for a drill bit. Came out with a prime candidate for Mrs. John K. Butzin.
SIGRID: ( Starts speaking Apologies. American only. I come from Dusseldorf, yes? Came to this great country 90 years ago no, 90 days ago. Apologies. Took job in store as cleaning lady. Promoted to cashier. Now assistant, assistant
SIGRID: This my 'Wall of America' tribute, yes? To my new country. And in the center, of course, the three men I admire most in America.
COLETTE: I know this is a rejection letter. I can't open this. I can't be rejected today. I take rejection so I bet it's good news.
ALAN: I bet it's good news.
COLETTE: "Sorry. Not interested." I knew it. How can such a big rejection come from such a small piece of paper?
HANNAH: ( On phone ) Hello? Yes. Oh, hi, Brian. ( LISTENING ) Really? ( LISTENING ) Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!
MAUREEN: What's he saying?
HANNAH: He sold my novel.
HENRY: ( Nodding excitedly ) Brian sold Sleeping on the Moon! Oh my god! Oh my god!
HANNAH: ( Nodding excitedly ) Brian sold Sleeping on the Moon! Oh my god! Oh my god!
MAUREEN: Oh my god! Oh my god!
HANNAH: ( On telephone ) Yes, Brian. I will. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I will. Promise. Thank you!
HENRY: You did it, Hannah! You did it!
MAUREEN: I'm so proud of you, dear!
HANNAH: Thank you.
HENRY: We need to tell the group!
HANNAH: The group. Oh, dear. The group. No, no, I can't tell them about this.
HENRY: Why not?
HANNAH: She looks to Maureen for support.
HENRY: Suppose I tell them? They could hear the news from me.
HANNAH: Thank you, my friend. I can always depend on you, can't I?
JOHN: That's great for Hannah, her little book deal, and all. But John K. Butzin has some news to announce, as
WILLIAM: Hannah's just lucky. That's all. Here she comes!
HENRY: Here she comes!
HANNAH: Ohhhhhh. For me? You shouldn't have.
WILLIAM: Way to go, Ms. Published Author!
ALAN: We're all jealous, Hannah. Just No. Seriously. We're all jealous.
COLETTE: No. Seriously. We're all jealous.
HANNAH: You're all making too much of a spectacle here.
HENRY: When will your book come out, Hannah?
HANNAH: A year. Takes about a year.
WILLIAM: So how much did you get?
ALAN: Don't ask her that.
WILLIAM: ( Shrugging ) Why not? How much did you get?
HANNAH: I did OK. Leave it at that. What's important is that I owe this success to all of you. I would be lost without this writing group.
JOHN: ( Louder than normal ) I don't know if anyone heard.
ALAN: U.R. the Publisher?
HENRY: They self-publish. E-books. Print on That's right, Obert. But I'll have my book in two weeks. None of this B.S. waiting around. John K. Butzin will be a published author. And be published first.
JOHN: That's right, Obert. But I'll have my book in two weeks. None of this B.S. waiting around. John K. Butzin will be a published author. And be published first.
HANNAH: ( Ever-diplomatic ) Well, John. Congratulations.
ALAN: My, two published authors in the group. The rest of us are going to have to catch up.
JOHN: ( Reading ) Gunner stared out over the bleak horizon, seeing one dead Viet Cong after another lay scattered on the bloody hillside. He had won this time, but Gunner knew Charlie would be back in the morning. By god, he would be ready. So would his M60 General Purpose Machine Gun and Mark 2 Fragmentation/Hand Rifle Grenade. OK, John. Nicely done. Let's get some feedback.
ALAN: OK, John. Nicely done. Let's get some feedback.
HENRY: Well. In terms of the characters
JOHN: ( Jumping in ) Hold on, Obert. I wanna hear from
ALAN: We'll hear from everybody.
JOHN: I don't want to hear from everybody. She has a book coming out. John K. Butzin has a book coming out. I want to hear from Hannah, author to author.
WILLIAM: Oh, screw you.
ALAN: This is really going against the spirit of the group, John. Everyone's opinion is valid.
JOHN: Hers is more valid. What'd you think, Hannah? Tell me.
HANNAH: I-I . . .
WILLIAM: ( Standing up ) Going outside for a smoke. I'll go talk to him.
COLETTE: I'll go talk to him.
ALAN: Let's take a fifteen minute break, shall we?
COLETTE: I want you to meet someone special. This is my spiritual adviser. Doctor Xiroman has taken a vow of silence for one full year to protest climate change. What an amazing man. Dr. Xiroman is going to cleanse the air of all this rejection.
WILLIAM: See those jokers back there?
HENRY: ".such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again."
ALAN: There's been one rule in this house. Whatever Colette wants, Colette gets.
COLETTE: Thank you, Alan.
ALAN: She wants a Mercedes? No problem. Credit cards? How many? Her own business? Done. An agent?
COLETTE: ( Interrupting ) Very well-known. He's so known.
ALAN: Exactly. Well, guess who is coming in tomorrow to see Dr. Alan Mooney for an eye examination and new
COLETTE: I love you, Poodles.
ALAN: Love you more, Poodles.
ALAN: Dr. Alan Mooney.
DAVID: ( on phone ) Let me call you back.
ALAN: I know. Big fan. Big fan.
DAVID: Just act natural.
ALAN: Just act natural.
ALAN: Great. Let's start out with a basic eye examination.
DAVID: ( Reading )
X7K6AC: Very good, David. Would you like to try for what's behind Door Number Three? Try this one, please.
ALAN: Very good, David. Would you like to try for what's behind Door Number Three? Try this one, please.
DAVID: ( Reading )
E2PH8S: 20/25. Looking good, David. But anyone can identify simple letters and numbers. Let's see how you do reading a more challenging text.
ALAN: 20/25. Looking good, David. But anyone can identify simple letters and numbers. Let's see how you do reading a more challenging text.
DAVID: Good. Read me the first paragraph, Natasha, the Russian peasant, dressed oh-so-slowly, consumed totally, completely, absolutely, by endless thoughts of Yuri.
ALAN: Good. Read me the first paragraph, Natasha, the Russian peasant, dressed oh-so-slowly, consumed totally, completely, absolutely, by endless thoughts of Yuri.
DAVID: ( Reading; monotone ) Natasha, the Russian peasant, dressed oh-so-slowly, consumed totally, completely, absolutely, by endless thoughts of Yuri.
ALAN: Oh. Very nice. Very nice. Now the next paragraph, please.
DAVID: ( Reading; monotone ) "I never, ever thought I could feel this way," Natasha said excitedly. "Nor could I," Yuri said happily, his body dripping with enormous beads of sweat.
ALAN: Man. Wow. Gee. Isn't that great writing? My wife Colette wrote that. The patients just love reading her stuff. It's from her new novel, Nyet, Not Yet.
COLETTE: Hi, honey. So sorry to intrude.
ALAN: Colette? Gee, this is an incredible coincidence. We were just talking about you. And here you are!
COLETTE: ( Gushing )
ALAN: Oh, where are my manners? Colette, this is David Keller. David, this is my wife, Colette Mooney. The writer.
DAVID: Pleasure to meet you, David.
COLETTE: Pleasure to meet you, David.
ALAN: Actually, Colette wrote this beautiful prose you've been reading, David. Honey, I can't believe this Well, I was just dropping off
COLETTE: Well, I was just dropping off
ALAN: ( Overlapping ) Oh, of course. Thanks for bringing it by. Say, honey, David's been reading that first page of yours. You don't happen to have any more of that opening chapter, do you?
COLETTE: As a matter of fact, I think I do. I think I do.
ALAN: Say, how about that?
DAVID: How about that?
COLETTE: That went very well.
ALAN: Oh, yes, Poodles. Very.
COLETTE: Though David Keller did seem in a hurry to leave.
ALAN: The sooner he can begin reading.
COLETTE: I bet he calls tomorrow with an offer.
ALAN: I bet he calls tonight.
HANNAH: Henry. This is good. So good.
HENRY: Hannah nods. Really.
HANNAH: I'm dying to know more about Scott and Christy. What great characters.
HENRY: Yeah. Sure wish I knew what was going to happen with them. You'll figure it out, Henry. It'll pass. Focus on your writing. No distractions. The writing comes first.
HANNAH: You'll figure it out, Henry. It'll pass. Focus on your writing. No distractions. The writing comes first.
HENRY: Say, um, remember I offered to drive you around and show you a couple special places?
HANNAH: Who lives here?
HENRY: Richard Benedict.
HANNAH: Oh. That writer you like?
HENRY: Like? No. It's much more than that. Wow. He.He.
HANNAH: Can't say I've read his stuff. Nice house, though.
HENRY: Here we are.
HANNAH: Fitzgerald? He's the one who shot himself, right?
HENRY: No. Fitzgerald. F. Scott Fitzgerald. He wrote The Great Gatsby.
HANNAH: ( Interjecting ) I've never read it.
HENRY: Hannah stops, cognizant of the ever-present camera.
HANNAH: ( To camera ) Could you turn that off for a few minutes, please?
HENRY: You know they can't. What's wrong?
HANNAH: I've never read The Great Gatsby.
HENRY: You're kidding.
HANNAH: Henry. I never went to college. I've heard of Hemingway. A little. Fitzgerald. Somewhere. But I don't have your education. Your smarts. I haven't read all these great novels. My stories come from my heart.
HENRY: Gatsby is about social position and the American Dream and . . .
HANNAH: And it's your favorite?
HENRY: Here. Take my copy.
JOHN: ( On telephone ) Yes. I'm still holding. Where are you again? New Dehli? Oh.
EUDORA: Great book. Classic.
HANNAH: Oh, I needed this break. Thank you, You're welcome.
HENRY: You're welcome.
HANNAH: It's just that I'm starting to feel the pressure, you know? There is so much riding on this first book.
HENRY: Don't be silly. Sleeping on the Moon will hit the bestseller list. You'll be the toast of the literary world. And I'll come over to Beverly Hills and deliver a pizza to you.
HANNAH: Beverly Hills, ah.
HENRY: 62 EXT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT / CITY STREET - DAY 62
HANNAH: What a dear, sweet friend you are.
ALAN: Alright. Whose turn is it to read?
HENRY: Oh. Um. Someone else go. I don't have anything new ready tonight.
COLETTE: It's been weeks, Henry.
HENRY: I know. Still can't focus.
JOHN: Don't be a pussy, Obert. Get writing. Complete the mission.
HANNAH: Writer's block can be very serious, What's so hard, bro'? I mean, you've got Scott and Christy. Two friends. Tell their story.
WILLIAM: What's so hard, bro'? I mean, you've got Scott and Christy. Two friends. Tell their story.
HENRY: That's the problem. I think the story's changing.
ALAN: Changing? How so?
HENRY: Lately I'm feeling something much deeper, much richer. Scott and Christy, um, growing closer.
COLETTE: Christy's a beautiful, wealthy author in Beverly Hills. How close can they Follow me. Something happens. Christy has an epiphany. She-She realizes her feelings run much deeper now for Scott.
HENRY: Follow me. Something happens. Christy has an epiphany. She-She realizes her feelings run much deeper now for Scott.
WILLIAM: Nah. Don't buy it.
JOHN: They're friends. Why muck it up? Don't put 'em in the same foxhole.
COLETTE: Is this Scott wanting to go beyond the friendship? There's no way Christy would suggest it. What do you think, Hannah?
ALAN: Yes. Hannah, what do you think?
HANNAH: Gee, I-I guess.I really never thought of them that way.
HENRY: Hannah shakes her head. Chooses her words carefully.
HANNAH: No. It's always been a friendship.
HENRY: You don't see anything possibly happening between them?
HANNAH: No. Friends. Nothing more.
WILLIAM: I'd be uncomfortable with any changes in the relationship.
HANNAH: I'd be uncomfortable with any changes in the relationship.
HENRY: OK. Thanks, everyone. I'll try to have something on paper next time.
JOHN: Remember, Obert. Complete the mission.
WILLIAM: ( Lowered voice ) Got a sec? How much?
HANNAH: How much?
WILLIAM: Hey, I just figured, you know. You got that big advance. Help out a fellow writer. I'm good for it, Sorry. It's bad luck to loan money.
HANNAH: Sorry. It's bad luck to loan money.
WILLIAM: OK, then, just give it to me.
COLETTE: How much do you need?
JOHN: This is a big moment. Roaring Lion has been posted on Amazon.com. Now all books. Your fiction. Your nonfiction. They're ranked on Amazon by sales. Obviously everyone wants to be number one. They say a book is selling well on Amazon if it's in the top 5000. Time to run it up the flag pole. Sigrid?
SIGRID: ( Reading slowly aloud )
HANNAH: How am I doing? OK. Sort of. Brian called. Looks like there's real interest in movie rights for Sleeping on the Moon. Yeah, thanks.
MAUREEN: That's it. I'm in one.
HANNAH: That's it. I'm in one.
HANNAH: ( Reading; with feeling ) "Please come home, Michael." "Why would you want to marry me, Kyra? I barely graduated high school." "Michael, I don't care about some silly college degree. You're the most intelligent person I've ever known. You are my shining star."
ALAN: OK. Comments. Anyone?
HANNAH: I value your feedback. We're all in this together, right?
COLETTE: Oh.Gee.Hannah. What? I mean, you're being published. This is being published.
HANNAH: But my editor wants rewrites. Am I on track?
ALAN: Of course you are, Hannah.
WILLIAM: You got the deal. You got the check. First one to be published.
ALAN: I think what I'm hearing from the group is.is.you're fine. We all love it. Nothing here to critique. You don't need uswell, it's not that you don't need us, but, you
HANNAH: What do you think, Henry?
HENRY: Yes. Actually, it is really good, but there are a couple thingslittle thingsI'd point out. For example
JOHN: Holy Douglas MacArthur
ALAN: Idea for novel. Perhaps screenplay. The Amazing Doctor Eckleburg. An eye doctor turned crime fighter. Ladies
ALAN: Hey. Alan.
WILLIAM: Hey. Alan.
HENRY: Hannah's avoiding me. She doesn't respond to emails or voice messages. She's "busy." Always an excuse.
HENRY: Things have definitely changed between us. I did get to go to her place for dinner last night.
COLETTE: Yes. You noticed. I replaced the photo. I may be replacing other things around here soon.I was just using William.for research.
JOHN: This is going to be a great day for John K. Butzin. Yes, sir. First official book signing.
SIGRID: More than a few books. Many, many books, Ja?
JOHN: Ja, my Strudel. Many books.
SIGRID: ( On PA system ) Attention shoppers. Famous author, Mr. John K. Bootzin, signing new best seller. Up front of store. John K. Bootzin. Also, special today in plumbing department. Ballcocks. Two for one. All customers guaranteed will be satisfied. Ja.
JOHN: Sorry, Strudel. Seem to be shooting blanks today.
ALAN: Author! Author!
JOHN: Hey-Hey. The cavalry's arrived. Look who's here.
SIGRID: Hello, everyone!
HANNAH: Wouldn't miss your signing, John.
COLETTE: Smile, John!
HENRY: Congratulations, John.
JOHN: Thanks, Obert. Where's the Bukowski
HANNAH: William said he'd meet us here.
JOHN: What a turd. Never liked that punk Maybe he's still at our house.
ALAN: Maybe he's still at our house.
COLETTE: Maybe he is. Maybe I should go see.
ALAN: Maybe you should.
HENRY: This is in Chinese.
SIGRID: International edition!
ALL: ( Except John and Sigrid )
JOHN: Know what the hardware store manager said? He said today was their most successful book signing. Ever.
SIGRID: Ten books. But there are now at least ten homes in California where folks have books by Melville. Hemingway. Clancy. And now Butzin. It's a humbling thought.
JOHN: Ten books. But there are now at least ten homes in California where folks have books by Melville. Hemingway. Clancy. And now Butzin. It's a humbling thought.
ALAN: I've made an important decision as group leader. I've decided to ask William to leave the group. Now it has absolutely nothing to do with that incident at our house. It has nothing to do with the fact that I'm now sleeping in the guest room. But let's face itthe kid's a slacker. No contribution to the group. Zero. Zip. Nada. I'm sure he'll be fine with it.
ALAN: There's no need to get so upset.
WILLIAM: Fine. I was going to quit anyway. Leave this bunch of losers.
ALAN: Just ignore him.
WILLIAM: Colette, Colette, my pet. News Flash for you: Oprah's not callingunless she needs a massage. Get real!
JOHN: Oprah? She's not on TV anymore.
COLETTE: I know that. William turns his attention to Henry.
WILLIAM: The great Henry O. Man, you got the gift, bro'. But your head is up your ass over poor, sweet, successful Hannah here.
HENRY: ( Voice rising ) That's enough.
WILLIAM: I don't need any of you. I don't need any of your pointless, pedestrian feedback. I'm a writer.
JOHN: You've got goddamn three pages.
WILLIAM: They're a great three pages! You just don't appreciate my dedication.
HANNAH: You're a pretend writer, William.
HENRY: She's right. You act the part. You like the lifestyle. You hit on women. You quote Bukowski. But Bukowski did the work. Each and every day he wrote. That's your problem, William. You don't do the work.
WILLIAM: I don't do the work? Man, that sounds frickin' hilarious coming from you. When's the last time you wrote
ALAN: Not the sign!
ALAN: Idea for novel. Jealous husband murders his tramp-of-a-wife and buries her chopped-up body in the back yard.
HENRY: ( To himself ) Mr. Benedict, I just want to thank you. No. You've inspired my writing No. Hi. I'm Henry. I just think you're the greatest.
COLETTE: Let me tell you something, Henry.
JOHN: Nope. Not going to see Richard whatever-his-name-is. John K. Butzin, author, doesn't need to stand in line anymore. No, sir. This soon- to-be best-selling writer is spending every minute, every dollar, on promoting Roaring Lion.
SIGRID: ( Reading out loud )
JOHN: Wow. Look how far I've moved up
SIGRID: John Grisham. 12.
ALAN: He's older than I thought.
HANNAH: I've never seen him before.
HENRY: ( To himself ) Pleasure to meet you. No. Honor to meet you. He She They is my favorite
CLERK: Next, please.
RICHARD: ( On phone )
CLERK: ( To Henry )
RICHARD: ( On phone ) Absolutely not! I'll sue that bastard We need to move, Henry.
ALAN: We need to move, Henry.
COLETTE: Hi there.
RICHARD: ( On phone ) Damn it! That simply won't
HANNAH: Richard hangs up the phone. The two start chatting. Camera goes over to the shell-shocked Henry, still clutching his book, watching as Hannah and Richard carry on. Henry is so disconcerted by what he sees that he fails to notice Eudora, still with purple hair and matching glasses, the very next person in line behind Hannah, waving at him.
HENRY: So what did he say?
HANNAH: Who!?!? Richard Benedict. You know, the guy who just held up the line for five minutes talking to you?
HENRY: Who!?!? Richard Benedict. You know, the guy who just held up the line for five minutes talking to you?
ALAN: ( Over his shoulder ) Ten. It was closer to ten minutes.
HANNAH: I don't know. We just talked.
HENRY: He sure liked you.
HANNAH: We just talked, Henry. I mentioned my book. He started asking about it. Writer to writer. No big deal.
HENRY: No big deal? Talking to Richard Benedict. No big deal!
ALAN: You gave him your phone number.
HANNAH: Look, a guy like that reads more books in a week than I ever have. Why would he bother call
COLETTE: Henry inches closer to Hannah, forcing Hannah to move back, creating an uneasy dance between the two. She turns her back on Henry.
HANNAH: ( On telephone ) Coffee? Oh, God. I don't know, Richard. I really appreciate the invitation, but
ALAN: This isn't fair. This just isn't First, you get an agent. Then you sell your book. Then the big movie Please don't.
COLETTE: This isn't fair. This just isn't First, you get an agent. Then you sell your book. Then the big movie Please don't.
HANNAH: First, you get an agent. Then you sell your book. Then the big movie Please don't.
COLETTE: First, you get an agent. Then you sell your book. Then the big movie Please don't.
ALAN: Please don't.
COLETTE: No. This isn't fair. And now Richard Benedict wants to have coffee with you? All this is happening to you. And only you. Isn't there anything I don't knowsome kind of cosmic creative crumb for the rest of us to nibble on?
HANNAH: I don't like what you're suggesting, Colette. You know how hard I work. How devoted I am. And I have been totally supportive of your writing. I've encouraged you all along.
COLETTE: You wouldn't introduce me to your Brian didn't want to meet you. I Hannah has earned her success.
HANNAH: Brian didn't want to meet you. I Hannah has earned her success.
ALAN: Hannah has earned her success.
COLETTE: Butt out Mr. Idea Man.
ALAN: Hannah is a writer. She devotes herself one hundred percent to writing. Not one hundred percent to sleeping with writers.
HENRY: Why don't you two just go on ahead?
COLETTE: It's not fair that she be the only C'mon. Let's go.
HENRY: C'mon. Let's go.
ALAN: C'mon. Let's go.
COLETTE: 13! 13! 13! 13!
COLETTE: I know. I'm a shit for exploding at Hannah, aren't I?
HANNAH: Your writer's block?
HENRY: It's because your focus is always on everything else. Gatsby. Fitzgerald.
HANNAH: It's because your focus is always on everything else. Gatsby. Fitzgerald.
JOHN: Wow! All the books sold at the hardware store?
SIGRID: Ja. Every one.
JOHN: Didn't I tell you, Strudel? Write it and they will read.
SIGRID: Bye. Bye.
COLETTE: I have to see Ms. Piper. We just need five minutes. 1-2-3-4-5 minutes of her time.
COLETTE: Ms. Piper? Ms. Piper?
LOIS: Dr. Xiroman. I can't believe you're here. How lovely to see you again.
LOIS: ( Sighing; Distraught ) Look at my desk, Dr. Xiroman. Look at all this. Do you know what it is? Crap. It's all crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. I hate my job. I hate my life.
COLETTE: ( Confused ) Of course. Dr. Xiroman, you should write a book. This could be a whole
LOIS: Of course. Dr. Xiroman, you should write a book. This could be a whole
COLETTE: It's perfect! Television. Your own blog. Personal appearances.
LOIS: It's perfect! Television. Your own blog. Personal appearances.
COLETTE: Dr. Xiroman has no reaction. Colette can't believe what she is hearing.
LOIS: Getting from Xiro to One by Doctor Xiroman. Oh, I like that.
COLETTE: In fact, as long as you're here today, why don't we just get you under contract? I know just who to call in New York.
LOIS: In fact, as long as you're here today, why don't we just get you under contract? I know just who to call in New York.
COLETTE: ButBut. What about me?
HENRY: 100 EXT. RICHARD BENEDICT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 100
RICHARD: You're late, Pizza Boy.
HENRY: ( Overlapping ) They're with me. Your total comes to nineteen dollars and sixty-five cents.
RICHARD: Babe, I need a single.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Richard gives a last glance to the camera. He's got better things to do. Off he goes. Short beat. Hannah comes to the door wearing Richard's shirt and little else, carrying a single dollar bill.
HANNAH: Here you
HENRY: No distractions. The writing comes He's making me a better writer.
HANNAH: He's making me a better writer.
HENRY: Yeah. I bet he is.
HANNAH: Henry. Don't.
HENRY: No, No. This could be quite educational. How about Native Son? Why isn't it enough that I'm your Lord of the Flies? Portnoy's Complaint? Do you know any author? Harry PotterYou must know Harry Why isn't it enough that I believe in your writing?
HANNAH: Why isn't it enough that I'm your Lord of the Flies? Portnoy's Complaint? Do you know any author? Harry PotterYou must know Harry Why isn't it enough that I believe in your writing?
HENRY: Lord of the Flies? Portnoy's Complaint? Do you know any author? Harry PotterYou must know Harry Why isn't it enough that I believe in your writing?
HANNAH: Why isn't it enough that I believe in your writing?
HENRY: Sophie's Choice? Anything published in the English language.
HANNAH: That I believe in you?
HENRY: You didn't read Gatsby, did you? Never even opened it, I bet.
HANNAH: I'm not
JOHN: Well, Strudel shipped out.
HENRY: Sorry I'm late.
JOHN: Wutch you got here, Obert?
HENRY: New pages. I'm ready to read.
ALAN: Way to go, Henry.
JOHN: Christ. What's he doing here?
COLETTE: I've invited Doctor Xiroman to join our writing group.
ALAN: You must be joking, Colette.
COLETTE: I am not joking. And, as a matter of fact, I'll have all of you know that the doctor and I are soon to be published authors. We've signed with The Lois Piper Agency.
HENRY: You can't do this.
COLETTE: Why not? With William gone, we have an opening.
ALAN: Henry's right. We all have to agree on new members.
COLETTE: I don't care about your silly rules.
ALAN: I am the leader of the group
COLETTE: Oh, please. Alan.
ALAN: ( Voice rising ) I am the leader of the group.
COLETTE: And Dr. Xiroman is my co-author and he is joining "the group."
ALAN: He is not.
COLETTE: He is.
ALAN: Is not.
COLETTE: Is n
ALAN: Is n
HANNAH: ( Yelling )
STOP!: The room turns quiet. All eyes on Hannah. She composes Surprise all around. Hannah avoids looking at Henry.
COLETTE: Well, in this case one plus one equals one very successful writing team. I can't believe you, Hannah. You're doing this just to upstage our news about landing an agent.
ALAN: Stop it.
COLETTE: No, this is what it's all about. The spotlight always has to be on Little Miss Sunshine. Her agent. Her book deal. Her movie deal.
JOHN: News flash for you all. John K. Butzin is also saying Sayonara. Heading off on my international book Damn straight. Tijuana. I'm done with you pussies.
HENRY: Damn straight. Tijuana. I'm done with you pussies.
JOHN: Damn straight. Tijuana. I'm done with you pussies.
ALAN: Get out. Now.
COLETTE: You can't kick me out. I live here.
ALAN: Fine. Then go to your room.
COLETTE: We'll certainly have plenty to discuss in therapy.
ALAN: Go by yourself. I'm done.
COLETTE: Oh. Just like alwaysAlan finishes
ALAN: Idea for novel.
HANNAH: Henry . . .
HANNAH: Exciting, isn't it? I'm so nervous. I don't know half these people. Most of them are Richard's friends.
HANNAH: Oh my God!
HENRY: Hi, Hannah.
HANNAH: Henry. Ohhhhh. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming.
HENRY: Well, pretty hard to miss that article about you in People magazine. Just wanted to say hi. And congratulations.
MAUREEN: Hello, Henry. Hannah, come back. Your public awaits.
HENRY: Go on. They need you.
HANNAH: Please stay.
HENRY: Can't. Sorry.
HANNAH: Yeah. Hot date. You know. Can't keep her waiting. A flight attendant.
HENRY: Yeah. Hot date. You know. Can't keep her waiting. A flight attendant.
HANNAH: ( Buying the obvious A flight attendant?
HENRY: One sec. Wait here. This is for you.
HANNAH: One sec. Wait here. This is for you.
HENRY: ( Protesting ) Hannah . . .
HANNAH: Take it.
HENRY: No. No, thanks.
HANNAH: C'mon. It will take just a minute.
HENRY: I can't. Really.
MAUREEN: Dear, sweet Hannah. Please!
HANNAH: Just say hi.
HENRY: I've really got to
HANNAH: Oh, c'mon. You'll
HENRY: Well, I did it. I showed up to Hannah's signing. I congratulated her. I supported her, writer to writer. And I finally got introduced to Richard Benedictformally. Sort Look. Hannah dedicated her novel to me. Just like she promised.
DAVID: This is why I love LA. True story. This guy delivers a pizza to my house one night. Then the very next week, my wife has someone come in and clean the carpets. Guess what? Same guy. Small world, isn't it? So we get talking. He tells me his name's Henry. He's a writer. He's just finished a manuscript. Offers us a discount on the carpets if I'll read ten pages. I like that thinking. So I read ten pages. Wow. I want to read ten more. Before I know it, I've read the entire book.
HENRY: Hannah was right. The writing must always come first. Everything else waits. Everything. That's what I did finally. Finished my novel.
EUDORA: Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter
HENRY: ( Surprised ) Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further.
EUDORA: Not intimately. He died here, you December 21, 1940.
HENRY: December 21, 1940.
EUDORA: I go by there sometimes.
HENRY: The place on Hayworth.
EUDORA: Is that weird. That I do that?
HENRY: No. No. Not at all.
EUDORA: OK. Good. Because, you know, I don't want people to think I'm weird.
HENRY: Of course not. Do you write?
EUDORA: Kinda, sort of. But I'm thinking of joining a writing group.
CHILDREN: Trick or Treat!
JOHN: Look at this treat you get. A copy of Roaring Lion by John K. Butzin. Happy Halloween.
WILLIAM: C'mon. Admit it. You missed me. It wasn't as interesting once I left,
ALAN: OK. You've got ten seconds. Write down the name of your character. First name that pops into mind. C'mon. Tell me your character.
HANNAH: Let's see. My book ended up on the best sellers list. Stopping at Number
HENRY: You know Fitzgerald said that all good writing is swimming under water and holding your breath. He was right. But after all I've been through, I think I'm finally ready to exhale.
EUDORA: ( Laughing ) Yes, I'm totally busted. I'm buying four copies of A Slice of LA. One for each member of my writing group. Also because I think Henry Wayne Obert is the greatest new writer of the decade! Sexiest, too!
