PREDATOR: Screenplay by Peter Briggs
CASSIE: already got an inbound on that approach pending a beacon-fix. Hold on my mark until I get back with some confirmation. Rimward Traffic Control out. She thumbs a button and leans over to PARSONS.
PARSONS: PARSONS pulls out a coin.
CASSIE: PARSONS pulls out a coin.
PARSONS: INT. RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE HIROKO NOGUCHI is sweating heavily, a black forelock of hair falling across her Oriental features. Her eyes flicker warily from side-to- side as she holds the smooth length of the sword before her, trying to assess from where the next attack will come. She doesn't have to wait long; two NINJA SWORDSMEN drop to the floor in front of her, striking without hesitation. She expertly avoid the blows, parrying relentlessly. A persistent TONE begins to intrude O.S., like a telephone RINGING. She tries to ignore it, but her concentration is clearly broken. A THIRD SWORDSMAN appears from out of nowhere, his sword SWISHING towards her chest. The blade plunges deep into her stomach, emerging from her back. She glances down in annoyed disbelief.
HIROKO: The SWORDSMEN immediately flicker and disappear. She sheathes the sword with one precise movement and crosses the wooden paneled floor to her desk. Mopping her face with a towel, she thumbs a stud. The RINGING TONE stops, the corporate logo on her flat-screen desk panel replaced with a black girl's face.
HIROKO: CASSIE ( O.S., onscreen ) Easier if you come down and look.
HIROKO: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY An eight-wheeled articulated crawler rolls noisily through the rain, climbing an access ramp leading from the swamp to the outpost's empty main-street. A group of rhinos - brown two-horned quadrupeds indigenous to Ryushi - restlessly stir in their corral at it's approach. The crawler's pneumatics HISS gently as it comes to a halt, while somewhere off in the distance a dog BARKS. DON KAMEN, a lean man in his forties. climbs down from the cab mounted five feet above the ground and squints up at the main relay antenna. He adjusts the cowboy hat on his head against the drizzle and crosses the street towards one of the buildings, ignoring a Pepsi sign CREAKING in the gentle breeze. A glass-paneled door SWISHES automatically open before him.
URIOSTE: PARSONS looks up at KAMEN and grins.
KAMEN: PARSONS looks up at KAMEN and grins.
PARSONS: KAMEN places his hat on PARSONS' head and THUMPS it down.
KAMEN: URIOSTE ( snorts ) Yeah. We're almost out of beer.
PARSONS: Noguchi wouldn't let her go off on your hunting trip. KAMEN pours himself a cup of coffee from a BUBBLING percolator.
KAMEN: out in the wet taking pot-shots at the local wildlife isn't my idea of a good time, either. He sips gingerly from the cup of scalding liquid.
PARSONS: their own way back tomorrow.
KAMEN: their own way back tomorrow.
CASSIE: on 'Sixty Seconds'. Biggest market crash since twenty-four. KAMEN looks ill.
KAMEN: on 'Sixty Seconds'. Biggest market crash since twenty-four. KAMEN looks ill.

KAMEN: else you wanna ruin my day with?

KAMEN: else you wanna ruin my day with?
CASSIE: HIROKO enters, pulling on a leather jacket.
HIROKO: KAMEN nods to her and receives a quick smile for his trouble. They turn to watch the display clear, replaced with a computer simulation of the neighboring solar system.
CASSIE: twenty-four local time.
PARSONS: to make sure.
CASSIE: The simulation ZOOMS IN, revealing two unidentified objects heading towards the planet in the center of the display. Computer notations accompany them.
HIROKO: HIROKO watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change.

CASSIE: HIROKO watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change.
KAMEN: looking at.
PARSONS: looking at.
KAMEN: Everybody gives him a quick look, but nobody says anything. It's obviously not an appealing thought.
HIROKO: possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion. There's a great exhalation of breath, and everyone swaps significant glances. HIROKO seems worried. She scratches her forehead.
CASSIE: possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion. There's a great exhalation of breath, and everyone swaps significant glances. HIROKO seems worried. She scratches her forehead.
HIROKO: back to Antarctica Traffic Control. Better alert the nearest RimCorp Base, too. PARSONS nods, suddenly serious.
PARSONS: EXT. LINSON'S RANGE - SWAMP - AFTERNOON Down here in the swamp, the trunks of magnificent trees terminate in gnarled roots and disappear into watery murk, much like a Louisiana bayou. A group of attentive LEMUR-TYPE CREATURES suddenly bound for cover as a line of bullets THUDS into the wood nearby. Seconds later, a loud HUMMING NOISE intrudes O.S. and a pair of manta-ray-shaped hover-bikes with sleek lines and garnish decals SLAMS into FRAME suspended two feet above the mire, their powerful turbines kicking-up a swirl of spray. The two BIKERS skid to a halt and watch the CREATURES scatter. ACKLAND and YORK - men who on Earth might be called "good 'ol boys" - are both riding one-handed; powerful hi-tech rifles gripped in the other. YORK ( yelling ) You missed 'em, Ackland!

ACKLAND: other side. YORK nods his head, pulling his goggles down over his eyes. The two bikes ROAR off in pursuit.
MINH: BEAUVAIS cups her drink with both hands, assessing him.
BEAUVAIS: Ackland and York aren't such bad guys when you get to know 'em. Just a couple of weekend warriors. She peers curiously at the clunky cartridges MINH's thumbing into the belt feed. On the ground next to him is a widebore weapon on an over- the-shoulder guidance mechanism.
MINH: rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected. They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it. He peers into the belt and blows out some dirt.

KAMEN: pumps on the base air purifiers. The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
HIROKO: That was four months ago. I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is. KAMEN shrugs.
KAMEN: choice you've got. DILLER leans in to murmur quietly to GUTTIEREZ.
DILLER: A buzzer inside the crawler goes OFF. DILLER gets up to answer.
GUTTIEREZ: A buzzer inside the crawler goes OFF. DILLER gets up to answer.
DILLER: HIROKO shakes her head dubiously at KAMEN's comment.
HIROKO: one month operational. DILLER leans out of the crawler's cab and calls across.
DILLER: She turns back to KAMEN.
HIROKO: She turns back to KAMEN.
CASSIE: are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
HIROKO: PARSONS looks up from his board in harassment.
PARSONS: She meets KAMEN's eyes.
HIROKO: She meets KAMEN's eyes.
KAMEN: All you're gonna do is punch a temporary hole in the traffic control net. That'd be small potatoes even for terrorists. PARSONS and CASSIE are all-business at the control board.
PARSONS: She flips a switch. A nearby screen changes to display an orbital path sketched out in rectangular neon blocks.

HIROKO: A bead of sweat trickles down PARSONS' temple.
PARSONS: EXT. DEEP SPACE The pod speeds THUNDEROUSLY into CAMERA, blotting out our view.
PARSONS: He pulls off his headset with weary resignation.
YORK: ACKLAND has already dismounted as he watches the fireball hurtle to the ground. A BOOMING ECHO resonates across the forest, followed by a few plaintive SCREECHES from the planet's indigenous lifeforms, before settling back into an eerie silence.
ACKLAND: He raises a set of compact field binoculars to his face. THROUGH THEM he sees a thin haze of smoke rising from the treetops.
ACKLAND: YORK ( uncertain ) Not really. He lowers the binoculars and frowns.
ACKLAND: and when something like that hits. believe me, you know about it.
YORK: ACKLAND ( hesitant ) I dunno. I dunno. Something about this feels funny. He looks across at the plume of smoke snaking off into the sky.
KAMEN: She shakes her head, and manages a smile.
HIROKO: She shakes her head, and manages a smile.
KAMEN: She shakes her head, and manages a smile.
HIROKO: crowded for me.
KAMEN: KAMEN LAUGHS. HIROKO is straight-faced.
HIROKO: KAMEN LAUGHS. HIROKO is straight-faced.

HIROKO: She hugs her knees again, and suddenly looks a whole lot more at ease. KAMEN spots a square glass balanced on one of the tire's wide treads.
KAMEN: She offers the glass to him. He takes it and sniff cautiously.
HIROKO: She offers the glass to him. He takes it and sniff cautiously.
KAMEN: KAMEN hands the glass back and raises his own bottle.
HIROKO: KAMEN hands the glass back and raises his own bottle.

HIROKO: range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.

KAMEN: figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days. They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us. All we've gotta do is sit tight.
HIROKO: EXT. SPACE A peculiar blue scanning beam plays over the rotating mass of the incapacitated satellite, examining every section. it comes to the rent torn through it, and pauses. FROM THE SCANNER'S P.O.V., we see the structure of the satellite made up from a series of blue geodesic shapes. The damage registers as a cold, black mass. The beam switches off and the hovering PREDATOR shuttle turns smoothly on it's axis, thrusting towards the planet.

ACKLAND: YORK looks down at his data-stick, a handheld torch with a multi- purpose readout screen.
YORK: ACKLAND falls toward onto something, and YORK comes running.
ACKLAND: ACKLAND falls toward onto something, and YORK comes running.
YORK: ACKLAND steadies himself, and the two men shine their torches at the rhythmically-breathing SHAPE on the ground.
ACKLAND: stick's not broken. YORK looks at the data-stick again.
YORK: stick's not broken. YORK looks at the data-stick again.

ACKLAND: ACKLAND steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside.
YORK: ACKLAND steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside.
ACKLAND: with him. A heavy gust of air blows unexpectedly across the clearing with a BANSHEE HOWL, ruffling their hair.
YORK: YORK reluctantly follows ACKLAND as he thrashes through the thinn ing foliage, coming out at the rim of the impact crater. It's beginning to partially collapse, water seeping in. YORK runs his beam over something at the bottom of the shallow pit.

YORK: ACKLAND's maybe getting a little nervous now.
ACKLAND: He sees the churned earth, and the muddy trail leading off into the broken foliage.
YORK: ACKLAND prods this SECOND EGG with his gun.
ACKLAND: There's a CRACKLING NOISE, and the top of the EGG peels neatly open in four sections. The two men jump back in alarm, and YORK LAUGHS nervously. Something organic is pulsing inside. ACKLAND cranes his neck forward for a better look. There's an EXPLOSION of MOVEMENT. A spindly shape with a long segmented tail launches itself jack-in-a-box-style at ACKLAND. It's a FACEHUGGER. ACKLAND trips backwards, caught off-balance. His finger involuntarily squeezes the trigger of his rifle as he falls. A volley of shots describe and arc and light up the night with a PERCUSSIVE BOOM, and we.
CUT TO: from the trees; something with a heat-vision P.O.V. A PREDATOR. We see the flare of ACKLAND's gunshots, then SNAP IN to see the multi- colored from of his body toppling over, trailing a purplish FACEHUGGER, before we.
YORK: The FACEHUGGER's tail slithers tighter around ACKLAND's neck; and as YORK quickly retrieves his rifle, we.
CUT TO: ACKLAND's body away from the crater. It CLOSES IN on the FACEHUGGER, giving us a muted X-ray-type VIEW of circulatory fluid pumping around the HUGGER and into ACKLAND. YORK's limping badly, a dark stain blossoming on his baggy fatigue trousers. ACKLAND's not a small man, and the physical effort of hauling him through the reeds makes him sweat profusely. There's movement on the ground, and YORK sees why; one of the LEMURS has fallen victim to another FACEHUGGER, which dwarfs it's small furry body. The HUGGER's fingers all ripple simultaneously as it strengthens it's hold; the movement akin to somebody drumming their fingers on a table-top.
BEAUVAIS: She races over to help YORK ease ACKLAND up.
YORK: She races over to help YORK ease ACKLAND up.
BEAUVAIS: As ACKLAND is turned over, BEAUVIAS gets her first look at a FACEHUGGER. She shies away, repulsed.
BEAUVAIS: YORK grits his teeth, but the leg injury is too painful. He slumps slowly to the floor. BEAUVAIS ( yelling ) Minh! Minh, get out here!
YORK: YORK grits his teeth, but the leg injury is too painful. He slumps slowly to the floor. BEAUVAIS ( yelling ) Minh! Minh, get out here!
BEAUVAIS: YORK shakes his head.
YORK: There's a long pause while everyone considers the options.
MINH: There's a long pause while everyone considers the options.
BEAUVAIS: be know! The motion sensor outside begins BEEPING again. MINH catches BEAUVAIS' MINH hefts his 'howitzer' and leaves the tent. BEAUVAIS rounds on YORK, continuing.

BEAUVAIS: EXT. LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT MINH walks towards a line of flashing red strobes at the perimeter of the camp, the barrel of his weapon pointing casually forward. He studies the surrounding darkness. There's nothing out there. He shakes his head in MINH ( muttering ) Take a goddamn wrench to those things. He thumbs a stud on the top of the 'howitzer'. There's a gentle WHINE, and the HISS of hydraulic cylinders as the harness mechanism lifts the weapon up. It darts quickly to-and-fro; a mechanical snake seeking a target. We see MINH's hand in CLOSE UP. In addition to the firing trigger, there's also a thumb button. He squeezes it. The gun swings sharply around in a blinding movement, tracking something automatically. There's a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE as it fires-off three shots in rapid succession. Something that was only yards from MINH APPEARS and is blown backwards to CRASH against a tree bole, a mass of luminous green liquid and motion. MINH ( CONT'D ) ( dumbstruck ) MINH watches the helmeted PREDATOR fall face down into the water with a SPLASH, then lie motionless. YORK and BEAUVAIS are out of the tent in an instant.

KAMEN: He switches the controls over to manual and takes the chopper down. HIROKO rubs the sleep from her eyes.
KAMEN: KAMEN reaches under the pilot's seat and pulls out a hand-pistol. Passes it to her.
HIROKO: rounds, with through the barrel smart laser-sighting. Sure, I can handle this. HIROKO's show-boating and KAMEN knows it, but he still can't help being a little bit impressed.
KAMEN: EXT. LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN The two of them pick their way across mangled tripods and charred canvas. Part of the bivouac has collapsed - one of the guide ropes has burned through. HIROKO ( quietly ) Somebody picked an argument.
KAMEN: KAMEN nods and heads off that way, while HIROKO carefully inspects the wreckage dotted around the perimeter.
HIROKO: KAMEN nods and heads off that way, while HIROKO carefully inspects the wreckage dotted around the perimeter.
HIROKO: She begins to cross the camp, and her foot catches on a taut length of rope. SOMETHING swings down from the trees, hitting her squarely in the face and knocking her off her feet. HIROKO CRIES OUT in fear and surprise, then freezes at what she sees. Two bloodied bodies dangle head-first from the bough overhead; BEAUVAIS and MINH. Each has been skinned and is beyond recognition. KAMEN hears her exclamation and is out of the tent in an instant. He stops in his tracks.
KAMEN: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - MORNING It's raining again at the base. Under cover of an overhang, HIROKO watches as ACKLAND is trundled away from the 'chopper' on a paramedic trolley by GUTTIEREZ and DOC REVNA, an Indian woman in her late thirties. As KAMEN slams the 'chopper's side door, we see that HIROKO has left her leather jacket on the passenger seat. KAMEN runs after REVNA clutching a clear plastic bag.
KAMEN: He hands the bag over to REVNA. She peers at the contents curiously. The FACEHUGGER is inside, stiff and shriveled.
REVNA: REVNA shakes her head.
KAMEN: REVNA shakes her head.
REVNA: did. I'll run it through records and see what comes up. GUTTIEREZ checks that ACKLAND's body's secure on the trolley. KAMEN raps him on the back to get his attention.
KAMEN: might be playing up.
GUTTIEREZ: might be playing up.
KAMEN: might be playing up.
GUTTIEREZ: REVNA interrupts.
KAMEN: REVNA interrupts.
REVNA: ACKLAND is wheeled into a freight elevator. As KAMEN and HIROKO walk away across the rain-swept platform, a SHIMMERING FROM detaches itself from the rear of the chopper and lowers itself to the heli-jet pad.

KAMEN: URIOSTE exchanges a grin with CASSIE.
CASSIE: A SHRILL TRILLING from his console communicator makes PARSONS leap up to answer.
PARSONS: INT. RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY A CLOSE UP of an eye, bright blue and dilated. DOC REVNA's shining a hand- held light into ACKLAND's face. ACKLAND's regained consciousness, but is far from happy. He's sitting on the edge of a cot in the base Infirmary, an antiseptic room full of automated medical equipment. The Autodoc is suspended from the ceiling nearby, a circular cluster of sophisticated manipulator arms tipped with cutting blades and surgical paraphernalia.
ACKLAND: REVNA flicks off the probe.
REVNA: I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run. REVNA shakes her head and turns to KAMEN.
ACKLAND: I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run. REVNA shakes her head and turns to KAMEN.

KAMEN: ACKLAND ( consternated ) What do you mean, 'what happened'? What am I doing back here? Where's HIROKO ( insistent ) What's the last thing you can remember? ACKLAND thinks hard.
ACKLAND: HIROKO and KAMEN exchange significant glances.
HIROKO: uh. that's. that's all.
ACKLAND: uh. that's. that's all.
KAMEN: KAMEN turns to REVNA.
ACKLAND: KAMEN turns to REVNA.
KAMEN: REVNA pulls out a cylindrical glass stasis tube from a wall rack. She hands it to ACKLAND. He studies the dead FACEHUGGER floating inside with morbid fascination.
REVNA: ACKLAND tries hard to think, but it's as if a wall's slammed down hard on his mind.
ACKLAND: camp. You were out cold.
KAMEN: camp. You were out cold.
ACKLAND: help us go some way toward disproving our suspicion, he's the prime suspect right now. The news hits ACKLAND hard. He falters and leans back, addressing

KAMEN: Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here. KAMEN stares hard at her. That's not much of an answer, and HIROKO knows it. She capitulates.

GUTTIEREZ: test you wanted on the turbines.
KAMEN: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - AFTERNOON A metal rail surrounds the perimeter of the platform. DILLER leans against it down by the access ramp, smoking a cigarette and idly blowing rings into the air. BREWSTER pricks up her years and begins to quietly SNARL. DILLER glances down at her curiously.

DILLER leans against it down by the access ramp, smoking a cigarette and idly blowing rings into the air. BREWSTER pricks up her years and begins to quietly SNARL. DILLER glances down at her curiously.
DILLER: Now the rhino are restless too. CASSIE walks across the concrete roadway to join them.
CASSIE: BREWSTER stops SNARLS and progresses onwards to full-fledged BARKING.
DILLER: still. Their VOICES and BREWSTER's BARKS are filtered to the point of unrecognizability, eerily distorted. CASSIE's the first to hear the SOUND.
CASSIE: DILLER straightens up, looking out into the surrounding trees. It's a FAINT HUM, getting LOUDER every second.
DILLER: A hoverbike appears, trailing smoke from one of it's turbine intakes as it hurtles towards the base. Halfway between the trees and the ramp, it clips a fallen log and spins end-over-end. It's rider flies through the air and hits the swamp face-first. DILLER and CASSIE race down the ramp with BREWSTER YELPING excitedly in the lead.
CASSIE: DILLER splashes through the swamp and pulls the limp body out of the mire. It's YORK. Blood has caked around his wounded leg.
DILLER: Something else has caught CASSIE's eye. A "something" almost two metres in length protruding from the rear of the wrecked hoverbike. Grasping the haft firmly, she works it free. CASSIE examines the PREDATOR spear, and slowly shakes her head.

ACKLAND: REVNA lowers her pen and looks across.
REVNA: ACKLAND winces in pain. His breathing's getting heavy. He nods.
ACKLAND: ACKLAND winces in pain. His breathing's getting heavy. He nods.
REVNA: ACKLAND winces in pain. His breathing's getting heavy. He nods.
ACKLAND: REVNA gets up swiftly and crosses to an automated pharmacy. ACKLAND's beginning to COUGH now.
REVNA: ACKLAND nods again. His COUGHING has deepened, and now he's banging his chest with a balled fist. REVNA hurries over with three red tablets and a disposable cup of water. ACKLAND takes them gratefully and gulps them down. The effect is almost immediate; ACKLAND quietens and an appreciative smile comes to his pale lips.
ACKLAND: Before he has a chance to elaborate, ACKLAND COUGHS once more. A thin spray of blood and saliva dots REVNA's white smock and speckles her cheek. ACKLAND's scrabbling fingers grab her lapels as he begins to hyperventilate. She pulls away, dragging him from the bed in the process. He falls to the floor, his MOANS growing in volume.
REVNA: Her fingers tremble as she clumsily examines a tray of surgical instruments. She finds a pneumatic spray-injector, fully charged with a vial of amber liquid attached. ACKLAND SCREAMS and fall backwards onto the floor, his hands clawing at the air. REVNA fumbles with the injector control and gives him a blast in his upper arm. ACKLAND convulses once then goes still, his eyes staring fixedly at the ceiling. The Infirmary is deathly quiet once again. We hear a gentle CRACKING, like twigs being snapped. REVNA watches in horrified fascination as a pool of blood spreads swiftly outward across the floor from below ACKLAND's corpse. REVNA shudders as the body moves a little, then is rolled over by something underneath it. WHAT SHE SEES. ACKLAND's body slumps forward onto it's front, revealing a gaping cavity in his back. Bits of spine and ribcage are just visible. A CHESTBURSTER - the second stage of the ALIEN lifeform - pulls itself clear and wipes red gunk from it's body with a pair of still-underdeveloped arms. Around it's head is a distinctive nascent crest. It kicks away from ACKLAND with a powerful push from it's legs, quickly gaining balance. After a moment appraising it's new environment, it stalks off behind a table. REVNA thinks quickly. She leaps forward and THUMPS a large red stud next to the pressure-door, which promptly RUMBLES closed. The room is bathed in pools of shadows. Plenty of hiding space for the creature. REVNA hears breaking glass, making her start. She cautiously edges over to the Autodoc and looks up into the forest of There's a wicked looking blade there, the kind used in major surgery. REVNA reaches up and twists the base; it detaches easily. Now she's armed. Stooped over, she begins to stalk the CHESTBURSTER. There's a flurry of movement, and suddenly the hunter becomes the hunted. The CHESTBURSTER vaults from the table at her with a SHRILL SHRIEK, and REVNA blindly swings her make-shift knife in defense. We hear a SIZZLE like frying bacon.
HIROKO: HIROKO ( astonished ) HIROKO leans over to examine him, but a particularly loud CRASH from within the Infirmary distracts her.

DILLER: GUTTIEREZ races up and hands DILLER a wrench with a shaped tip.
GUTTIEREZ: He inserts the end into the open flap and pulls hard, the physical effort showing on his face. The door grinds open about eight inches. The bloodied CHESTBURSTER forces itself through the narrow gap, HISSING vehemently. Yellow fluid wells from a wound in it's crested skull, dissolving everything it comes into contact with. The small group gathered around fall back in panic, jarring YORK's trolley and knocking HIROKO to the floor. BREWSTER BARKS at the CHESTBURSTER, which tenses as if to leap. DILLER brings the wrench down, but the CHESTBURSTER evades his blow and takes flight. It strikes at HIROKO, who reflexively draws her head back and escapes with nothing more than a light scratch to the cheek. The ALIEN disappears down the corridor, leaving a trail of smeared blood and a series of acidic pits which melt the grillework flooring. GUTTIEREZ bends down and helps HIROKO to her feet. Shocked, she MUTTERS something to herself in JAPANESE, and regains some of her composure.

HIROKO: DILLER stands there with the metal bar. Does she think he's nuts?
CASSIE: She turns away and retches. HIROKO steps through and goes pale. There are blood-smears over everything, and it's all GUTTIEREZ can do to stop BREWSTER from getting in there.
PARSONS: ripped right off. The little fucker was strong.
HIROKO: ripped right off. The little fucker was strong.

KAMEN: basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers. If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power. That should give us ample time to find it.
HIROKO: a release for the weapons. Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board. CASSIE nods soberly. HIROKO looks at everybody, and her words are carefully chosen.
DILLER: itself. However, just to add a little incentive. I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does. This seems to appeal to those assembled there. There's a palpable buzz in the air.

YORK: bushmen, but they had all this hi-tech shit strapped all over 'em. They must've wasted Beauvais and Minh inside thirty seconds. Minh got off a couple of shots from that cannon of his, but he might as well have been using a B-B gun. I don't know how the hell I made it out of there alive. He nods toward the PREDATOR spear in HIROKO's hands.
KAMEN: YORK nods. He gets to his feet and leaves the room. HIROKO waits until the door slides shut behind him.
HIROKO: their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
KAMEN: their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.

DILLER: There's more NOISE.
URIOSTE: There's more NOISE.
URIOSTE: DILLER ( sarcastic ) Yeah, eyestrain. What's with the lights?
URIOSTE: spares. Wave that thing in the corner. DILLER sweeps the tracker carefully around. The small screen registers URIOSTE pulls at a two-piece hexagonal grating set in the center of the floor. It's heavy and thick with grease, but she doesn't seem to mind. Below it is what looks like a round metal plug. Recessed into its surface is a lever next to a central pressure valve, with handholds on either side. She turns the lever. There's a loud CLUNK, and a plume of steam JETS out of the valve.

DE VRIES: GUTTIEREZ' radio headset CRACKLES to life. HIROKO ( O.S., on headset ) Guttierez, what the hell's going on up there?
GUTTIEREZ: DE VRIES glances around the rooftop, annoyed.
DE VRIES: PREDATOR ( O.S. ) INT. RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT URIOSTE's flashlight bobs up-and-down on the water below, still lit and well out of reach. URIOSTE ( disgustedly ) DILLER ( O.S., muffled ) What's the matter?
URIOSTE: and-a-half's worth of slack. DILLER ( O.S., muffled ) INT. RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM DILLER crosses to the wall-mounted winch. On the mechanism's side is a luminous digital counter giving the current cable depth in meters. He pulls a throw-switch, and the display slowly changes from "8" to "9.5" as the cable feeds out.
DILLER: DILLER's quivering fingers grope for his flashlight.
GUTTIEREZ: platform below. He watches the infra-red shapes of other people running towards the source of the shots.
KAMEN: DILLER breaks free of the other man's grasp. He looks as if he's about to say something, but never gets the chance. There's a sound of TEARING METAL, and a HISSING seven-foot express train of teeth and biomechanical limbs ERUPTS from the shadows.
PARSONS: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK With superhuman strength, the ALIEN brutally back-hands DILLER, splintering his skull and killing him instantly. His body caromes into THOMAS, knocking the man to the floor. The ALIEN turns to KAMEN, it's questing fingers closing around his throat and hauling him off the ground. The space on the catwalk it limited; there's so many people it's impossible to get a clean HIROKO draws a bead on the ALIEN. She flips off the safety on her rifle. It's the tiniest CLICK, but the ALIEN somehow senses danger. It's skeletal tail lashes out, sending both her and the weapon flying. CALDWELL gets in for his shot, but the tail's there in a second. It strikes like a snake. Once. Twice. The stinger punctures CALDWELL's chest and throat. Nobody could survive something like that. The ALIEN flicks it's skull back around to KAMEN. The man's head is inches away from it's eyeless face.a row of burnished metal teeth open.the toothed inner tongue ready to strike. WHOOMPH. Something lands heavily close-up, jarring the catwalk. The ALIEN drops KAMEN and WHIRLS. A spear wielded by an INVISIBLE FORM appears out of nowhere and PIERCES the ALIEN's midriff, spraying acidic fluid. The creature emits a OUTRAGED SHRIEK and flails around, it's ubiquitous tail arcing toward the camouflaged assailant. The STINGER makes contact: there's a SPUTTERING SOUND as the PREDATOR's cloaking device begins to flicker spasmodically, giving us peek-a-boo glimpses of it's natural form. Electrical sparks dance around the PREDATOR's ruin wrist-computer, luminous green blood welling from a wound in his From out of the Pump Room comes more NOISE, like metal being trashed in a compactor. HIROKO SCREAMS at KAMEN, who's COUGHING painfully next to the door panel.

HIROKO SCREAMS at KAMEN, who's COUGHING painfully next to the door panel.
HIROKO: KAMEN hastily slaps the 'close' button and both halves of the exterior pressure bulkhead RUMBLE together. A SECOND ALIEN appears from the shadows within and prises it's fingers into the dwindling gap, struggling for purchase. Despite the ALIEN's best efforts, the door motors are too powerful and the opening seals with a satisfying solid CLUNK. MUFFLED POUNDING comes from the other side. Nearby, THOMAS has retrieved CALDWELL's weapon in the heat of the fight and is bringing it to bear on the PREDATOR. At the last possible moment HIROKO sees what he's about to do.
HIROKO: Reflexively, she knocks the barrel away as THOMAS looses a volley of hot bullets sear the night.
PREDATOR: PREDATOR ( CONT'D ) One of the ALIEN's hands clamps firmly onto the PREDATOR's mask and wrenches it off. HIROKO stares at the PREDATOR's face in fascination. From the distinctive features, we see that it's BROKEN TUSK. The PREDATOR's good hand flashes down to his thigh, almost too quick to follow. In one rapid movement a circular 'smart-weapon' is brought up, slicing the front of the ALIEN skull away from it's head. In a feat of strength, the PREDATOR lifts his opponent's corpse on the end of the spear and hurls it over the catwalk railing. Not wasting a second, BROKEN TUSK performs an almost-vertical bound of some twenty feet with astounding grace. He grips a pipe running down the side of one of the building modules, then clambers over the roof's edge and finally disappears from view. BREWSTER continues to BARK HIROKO's headset has been knocked to the floor and a FRANTIC MUTED VOICE is coming from it. She picks it up, and presses the 'transmit' HIROKO ( into headset ) It's alright, Rob.
THOMAS: DE VRIES HIROKO thinks quickly, and comes to a decision. She speaks into her radio headset.
GUTTIEREZ: DE VRIES HIROKO thinks quickly, and comes to a decision. She speaks into her radio headset.

KAMEN: BREWSTER's BARKS cease, replaced instead with a TERRIFIED LOW WHINING.
DE VRIES: GUTTIEREZ jogs over to BREWSTER. Lowers his rifle to the ground and fumbles with the knot tying the dog to the pipe.
GUTTIEREZ: A spray of plastic shards EXPLODES not three feet away from GUTTIEREZ. The rifle goes skittering away out of reach, and he scrambles away as an ALIEN half-pulls itself out of the sewer overflow, wet and BREWSTER's a mass of fur, totally out of control. When the ALIEN lashes out to grab the HOWLING animal, there's nothing GUTTIEREZ can do. BREWSTER's legs are the last thing we see, thrashing helplessly as she's dragged down into the splinter-edged gap.

DE VRIES: THOMAS grabs CALDWELL's rifle from the deck. He races towards GUTTIEREZ, with DE VRIES close behind.
THOMAS: From behind comes the SOUND of more rupturing plastic as biomechanoid limbs struggle up out of newly-broken ducts. THOMAS heaves the rifle over the heads of the emerging ALIENS. Although GUTTIEREZ snags it awkwardly, he quickly turns the barrel on the relentless creatures.
GUTTIEREZ: DE VRIES races up to join them, SCREAMING as she fires. KAMEN glances down at this tracker's tiny screen. It shows clusters of signals, lots of them. KAMEN ( hollering ) They're all around, they're in the drainage system! DE VRIES reacts swiftly, loosing a round of shots at the emerging ALIENS. GUTTIEREZ yells across to KAMEN.
GUTTIEREZ: ALIENS are appearing everywhere. From the overflow ducts; over the platform edges; along overhead cable supports. Having taken on the genetic characteristics of their hosts, many of them are non-humanoid. All of them are living nightmares.
HIROKO: INT. RYUSHI STATION - LIVING QUARTERS CASSIE brushes her teeth in front of the wall-mounted mirror of her tiny bathroom-cubicle. A raucous emergency klaxon GOES OFF in the corridor outside.
CASSIE: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK THOMAS, GUTTIEREZ, and DE VRIES are cut-off. As they race swiftly down the street, GUTTIEREZ tries hard to interpret his tracker's signals. A particularly loud BLEEP registers from a source immediately behind them. He glances over his shoulder and sees an ALIEN crawling down the outside of a module towards them.
GUTTIEREZ: DE VRIES' head turns. She sees the ALIEN and nails it with a rapid burst. It falls onto the concrete nearby, writhing in it's death The group round the corner of a building. Across the street from them is parked KAMEN's crawler.
THOMAS: DE VRIES ( to Guttierez ) C'mon, man; punch this cow! GUTTIEREZ fumbles at the ignition. They keys are there. He flips them, and the engine GROWLS to life.
HIROKO: HIROKO hears a HORRIBLE NOISE nearby. A field of cows being slaughtered by machetes would sound like this.
KAMEN: HIROKO hears a HORRIBLE NOISE nearby. A field of cows being slaughtered by machetes would sound like this.
HIROKO: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - RHINO PEN - DUSK An ALIEN is SMASHED sideways into the one solid wall of the pen, broadsided and instantly crushed by a ton of FRENZIED rhino. It's yellow blood eats into the weighty quadruped, eliciting ANGUISHED BELLOWS of pain from the hapless creature. ALIEN stingers slice through the air. Rhinos try to bolt but are intercepted by inhumanly powerful forces. It's wholesale carnage.
DE VRIES: THOMAS raises his rifle and looses a fusillade of shots through the roof. One of them RICOCHETS off the interior, SHATTERING the windscreen. There's a THUMP from outside.

The dead ALIEN's corpse tumbles through the acid-eaten hole, falling into the cab's rear seat and promptly burning through that as well. Not far away across the platform, the massive doors to the auto-shop hanger are RUMBLING slowly closed. GUTTIEREZ ( shouting ) Hold the doors, hold the doors! They don't hear him. The doors seal with a BOOM of finality.

THOMAS: PAGE 70 MISSING THOMAS looks concernedly at GUTTIEREZ.
THOMAS: GUTTIEREZ takes off the headset and scrutinises it closely.
GUTTIEREZ: DE VRIES rips her headset off and urgently passes it to him.
DE VRIES: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK Despite their ferocity and weapons, it's clear that the small group of PREDATORS are being overrun by the ALIEN horde. BROKEN TUSK's shoulder cannon swivels automatically, blowing away another attacker. Hearing a distinctive SCREAM, he looks across the platform. One of the PREDATORS, it's camouflage cloak flickering intermittently, is trying to resist being dragged down into a duct. The two ALIENS in either side plunge their tail-stingers into the PREDATOR's body, making it CRY OUT in agony.
DE VRIES: GUTTIEREZ is desperately trying to operate the tiny plastic microswitches on the headset with his fingernails.
GUTTIEREZ: THOMAS brings his weapon to bear and pulls on the trigger. He gets off one shot, then nothing more happens. He looks at the counter on the side. It reads 'zero'.

HIROKO: Her VOICE quavers so badly with fear and panic, it's a wonder the computer can recognize it. FOUR NINJA SWORDSMEN promptly appear, forming a semi-circle between HIROKO and the ALIEN. The ALIEN halts, confused by this intrusion. It swipes at the pre-programmed holograms, bewildered by the lack of contact as it's claws pass through them. Gaining on a few seconds of bought time, HIROKO flings herself towards the PREDATOR spear lying forgotten nearby. The ALIEN locks in on this sudden movement and charges through the holograms at her. HIROKO GRUNTS, swinging the spear with her full strength. She's no super-athlete, but the cutting edge's advanced metallurgy does the job. It slices half-way through the ALIEN's skull and sticks there, spewing yellow fluid everywhere. HIROKO beats a hasty retreat as the dying biomechanoid falls to the floor, fumbling at the lodged INT. RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS HIROKO reels into the outside corridor. She SHRIEKS as her shoulders are seized from behind.
KAMEN: HIROKO looks at KAMEN confusedly as he continues along the corridor.

She sights an ALIEN crawling across the top of a group of cylindrical storage containers. Draws a bead on the metal tank and fires. A molten ball EXPLODES outward, transforming the immediate vicinity into a blazing inferno. The ALIEN's body twists end-over-end, remaining immobile as it hits the deck. A curtain of fire ripples across the platform.
THOMAS: Their victory is short-lived. The other ALIENS crawl cautiously forward, flames licking their faces but leaving them unharmed. We can clearly hear the HISSING of their internal jaws.
DE VRIES: The headset in GUTTIEREZ' hand BLEEPS as it turns into the correct channel. He YELLS into it.
GUTTIEREZ: things out here'll seem like the Easter Bunny in comparison! Swear to THOMAS turns and hammers on the impenetrable plate metal.
THOMAS: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! CLICK. GUTTIEREZ' bullets are gone.
DE VRIES: The first of the ALIENS rushes at them. This is the end. DE VRIES
GUTTIEREZ: INT. RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP THOMAS pushes DE VRIES through the opening, with GUTTIEREZ hurriedly The Auto-shop is a large spacious workshop with three bays lining one wall. The front of a crawler pokes from one of them, while in the center of the room another crawler is raised above a maintenance-pit on a hydraulic platform. A handful of GREASE MONKEYS stands around the doorway, brandishing power-tools in lieu of firearms. A blonde surfer- type with long straggly hair rushes over to them. This is MATT, their savior.
MATT: GUTTIEREZ stares through the narrow opening as the doors seal back up. In the midst of the flames, the ALIENS are fighting a pitched battle tooth-and-nail with their unseen opponents. It's like a scene out of INT. RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS Clusters of rotating emergency lights wig-wag above HIROKO and KAMEN as they flee through the maze of long corridors leading to the Command Center. KAMEN is falling behind as they approach a junction.
HIROKO: HIROKO and KAMEN race along the final corridor leading to the Command Center. Halfway down, KAMEN turns in response to a JARRING SOUND from the rear. The metal grating making up the floor is SMASHED violently from beneath.
KAMEN: HIROKO and KAMEN race along the final corridor leading to the Command Center. Halfway down, KAMEN turns in response to a JARRING SOUND from the rear. The metal grating making up the floor is SMASHED violently from beneath.
KAMEN: INT. RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER The PANDEMONIUM from the outside corridors gets the attention of YORK and everybody else in admin. He crosses to the bulkhead doorframe, and what he sees makes his eyes bug.
YORK: He SHOUTS back into the crowded room.
HIROKO: CASSIE's head shoots around.
CASSIE: to get through here!
YORK: CASSIE's eyes widen in terror.
CASSIE: HIROKO turns to see the long, phallic head of an ALIEN emerge momentarily from out of the foam. Something yanks at KAMEN and he disappears beneath the surface with an expression of pained surprise.
HIROKO: HIROKO starts to thrash at the foam, but CASSIE reaches out and drags her away.
CASSIE: The chair begins to buckle, collapsing in on itself.
HIROKO: The chair begins to buckle, collapsing in on itself.
YORK: With a supreme effort, CASSIE yanks HIROKO through the gap. YORK vaults clear as the chair SNAPS in two, leaving the bulkhead to THUNDER closed. The two women collapse in a heap on the floor.
PARSONS: No reaction. He tries again.
HIROKO: PARSONS runs through each of the screens.
PARSONS: and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally the place.
HIROKO: the place.
CASSIE: the place.
HIROKO: DRISCOLL - a big guy with a beard - LAUGHS curtly.
DRISCOLL: got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
HIROKO: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOPS - DUSK BROKEN TUSK and the other PREDATOR scramble up onto the rooftop in a bid to escape their unstoppable opponents. Back-to-back, they take up fighting positions. A few seconds later, the first of the ALIENS Both the PREDATORS' shoulder cannons blaze, firing volley-after-volley. Still the ALIENS keep on coming, finally reaching the point where it's hand-to-hand.and nothing else. It's a vicious, fast, and bloody on both sides. BROKEN TUSK takes flight; his companion is not as lucky. The other PREDATOR kicks an ALIEN from him and over the roof's edge. The ALIEN lashes out with lightning-fast reflexes, pulling the PREDATOR with it. Both creatures hurtle downward and hit a nest of cabling stretched across from one of the modules. Caught like flies in a spider's web. Both thrash about, severing cables as they do. Electrical sparks CRACKLE through the INT. RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER Everything electrical in the Command Center flickers momentarily, and the bank of monitors turn to static. There's an instant of silence collective concerns amongst those gathered there.

GUTTIEREZ: matter of time, that's all. GUTTIEREZ' headset lies nearby. PARSONS muted VOICE comes out of it. One of the GREASE MONKEY's snatches it up and listens.
GREASE MONKEY: INT. RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER GUTTIEREZ ( O.S., on speaker ) Pretty damn good shape, considering. You can tell Don Kamen from me his people have got balls of steel.
PARSONS: GUTTIEREZ ( O.S., on speaker ) Pretty damn good shape, considering. You can tell Don Kamen from me his people have got balls of steel.
HIROKO: GUTTIEREZ ( O.S., on speaker ) Pretty damn good shape, considering. You can tell Don Kamen from me his people have got balls of steel.
HIROKO: There's a pregnant PAUSE from the speakers.
HIROKO: GUTTIEREZ ( O.S., on speakers ) Uh. I'd say that was a negative. If we open the doors, those things are gonna swarm inside. There's another problem, too.
HIROKO: GUTTIEREZ ( O.S., on speakers ) De Vries put a round through the storage tanks over by the west pier on the way in here. Right now, the stuff sprayin' out is just burnin' up, but if we get a blow-back, a good part of the station could go with it.
CASSIE: there's got to be a way out of this.
HIROKO: there's got to be a way out of this.
YORK: YORK's kept quiet, but everyone turns to him now. His tone is scathing and cuts to the marrow.
CASSIE: can cut some kind of deal. YORK looks around at them in incredulous disbelief.
MATT: the admin module onto the back of Big Bertha. That way we could put a bit of distance.
HIROKO: remote operation. Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and DRISCOLL looks around uneasily.

DRISCOLL: INT. RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER DECK A small group of people, most of whom we saw in the Command Center, are clustered around a section of the poorly-lit maintenance corridor. HIROKO's wearing a black hi-tech catsuit, a fetishist's dream. Across her shoulder is a pistol in a slung bandolier holster. She nods at a pile of clothing in DRISCOLL's hands.
HIROKO: She takes it from him. Slides her legs into the bottom half and pulls it up. YORK watches with an expression of incredulity etched on his on foot!

DRISCOLL: helmet pick-ups, too. That's also on the display.
HIROKO: be going in blind.
PARSONS: be going in blind.
HIROKO: you're gonna have to negotiate. Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway. Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.

HIROKO: CASSIE and DRISCOLL exchange worried looks.
CASSIE: into any Aliens. HIROKO takes a deep breath. Beads of perspiration dot her forehead. PARSONS nods.
PARSONS: myself. Where's the disk? PARSONS hands over a vinyl-wrapped packet.
HIROKO: myself. Where's the disk? PARSONS hands over a vinyl-wrapped packet.
PARSONS: HIROKO slips it into a breast-pocket and secures the flap.
HIROKO: DRISCOLL hands several metallic objects to HIROKO.
DRISCOLL: They're magazines for her gun. She slots them into the bandolier.
HIROKO: press the green enabling button. PARSONS ( interrupting ) No. There's two of them. She pulls on the zip and begins locking the harness clasps into place.

PARSONS: there. Once that crane starts moving.well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response. YORK hands over a sophisticated-looking power-tool.
YORK: button to switch over to the rivet gun. The sensors'll choose blade or socket heads automatically.
HIROKO: YORK and DRISCOLL lower the massive dome-fronted helmet over HIROKO's head. Auto-clasps lock into place as it brackets with the collar. PARSONS clips the slimline air-tank to her back, and DRISCOLL makes the CASSIE and the others hold their weapons and motion-trackers steadily at a fixed point on the ground. Two ONLOOKERS bend down to the pressure-hatch beneath the floor-grating. It's identical to the one DILLER and URIOSTE removed earlier. A plume of pressurised gas jets into the air, and they pull the metal sealing-plug free. CASSIE scrutinizes her tracker.

CASSIE: HIROKO reaches up to her helmet and presses a chunky button on one HIROKO's P.O.V. We're looking through the transparent bowl of the helmet at the open shaft, braken water SLOSHING around it's rim. Superimposed lines of glowing neon appear on the visor's surface, a precisely overlaid duplication of the scene in computer-graphic form. A flatly- synthesised male COMPUTER VOICE comes over the helmet speakers, O.S. COMPUTER VOICE ( O.S., on speakers ) Approaching 'A' module lower level venturiduct DS Oh-four. HIROKO gets down on her hands and knees and crawls towards the opening. She stares at the murky water with mounting apprehension. Tries to reassure herself.
HIROKO: She looks around at the impassive, staring faces. Summoning up her courage, she submerges the helmet.
CASSIE: HIROKO's eyes dart around, speaking volumes. She swallows hard and calms down.
PARSONS: HIROKO's eyes dart around, speaking volumes. She swallows hard and calms down.
HIROKO: Steeling herself, she takes a deep breath and plunges headfirst into the water once more. HIROKO's P.O.V. Everything goes to blackness again. The head-up-display presents a view of the unseen tunnel in cheerful candy-apple hues. COMPUTER VOICE ( O.S., on speakers ) Entering venturi duct, en route to secondary overflow sump DS oh four slash eleven. YORK watches HIROKO's feet disappear into the shaft.
PARSONS: The heavy sealing-plug is dragged across the grating and positioned over the hole. YORK shakes his head.
YORK: INT. RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT CASSIE wasn't kidding about the venturi-duct. It's only about half- again as wide as HIROKO. The only illumination comes from the hazy circle above. As the plug reseals the hole, even that's gone. Something flickers. Two weak fluorescent tubes come on, lighting the murk with a faint orange haze. CASSIE ( O.S. on speakers ) All the comforts of home.
HIROKO: CASSIE ( O.S., on speakers ) Don't mention it. She inches her way through the narrow space towards us, breathing heavily. The CLICKING of the motion-tracker in her helmet is overwhelming in the silence.
GREASE MONKEY: He steps into a pool of slippery residue and loses his footing.
GUTTIEREZ: MATT claps his hands together - just once - to get everybody's There's a SCREAM from behind. They wheel around in time to see the GREASE MONKEY being tugged into the maintenance opening. THOMAS yells down from the platform.
MATT: There's a SCREAM from behind. They wheel around in time to see the GREASE MONKEY being tugged into the maintenance opening. THOMAS yells down from the platform.
THOMAS: A box with two large buttons - one green, one red - dangles from the ceiling on the end of a cable. MATT forces down the red control, making the platform lower. Several tons of machinery and crawler bring about the demise of the ALIENS as they reach the lip of the opening, CRUSHING their chitinous limbs to smithereens. An ALIEN rolls out of the pit in time, scrambling for the safety of the nearby shadows. DE VRIES sights it.
DE VRIES: One of the MEN has seen it. His head snaps up to a mammoth engine- block suspended from a winch high above. He LEAPS for the release- catch as the ALIEN passes underneath. Pulls hard on the grip. Chains RATTLE noisily as the block THUNDERS down. The ALIEN begins to look up, just a second too late. The heavy piece of machinery SMASHES into the creature, flattening it instantly. Unseen by anybody, another ALIEN has escaped to the roof of the platform-bound crawler. It wraps it's long, bony fingers around the face of the MAN, stifling his CRIES and pulling him off the deck. The LOUD CLATTERING of his chainsaw bouncing off the floor-grating gets THOMAS' attention.
THOMAS: THOMAS retrieves the fallen tool and jams the 'on' switch hard. The ALIEN's tongue shoots through the GREASE MONKEY's skull, showering THOMAS with a faint speckling of blood. The ALIEN discards the body and lunges at THOMAS, who counters bringing the chainsaw up. The blade slices into the creature's throat, and up through it's head. THOMAS draws out the chainsaw quickly. Something happens to the PITCH of the blade, a peculiar sound. The acid eats through the links of the chainsaw band. Like a metallic snake, it WHIPS off it's supporting frame. Straight at THOMAS.
HIROKO: She places the tip of her power-tool over the first of the grille's anchoring bolts. The complex mechanism WHINES as it selects the correct wrench-tip for the job.
PARSONS: INT. RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP- CRAWLER CABIN THOMAS is laid-out in the back seat of the crawler's cab, with DE VRIES and MATT trying to staunch the wounds from the chainsaw band's impact to his chest. GUTTIEREZ speaks into his headset mike.

GUTTIEREZ: INT. RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CHAMBER THUMP. THUMP. SLAM! The grille in knocked out of it's housing and floats lazily off into the water. HIROKO passes through the newly- created hole.
PARSONS: maintenance pit. CASSIE's all-business, immediately calling-up the base floor-plan files on a monitor. PARSONS ( CONT'D ) ( into headset ) Is Thomas gonna make it? GUTTIEREZ ( O.S., on speakers ) Uh.difficult to say. I think.

CASSIE: INT. RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CENTER HIROKO's pulls her third bolt free. It drifts slowly downward, slipping between the vanes of the floor turbine. A fragmented VOICE comes through on her headset, distorted beyond recognition. HIROKO's forehead knits together in concentration and CLICK. CLICK. BEEP! The routine sound of the motion tracker changes suddenly. HIROKO turns her attention from the task-in-hand to study the tracker's helmet readout. THREE NEBULOUS BLOBS have appeared from off-screen. Heading straight for her position.

She looks wildly around the chamber. The only way out the way she came in. COMPUTER VOICE ( O.S., on speakers ) Attention. Removal of restraining bolts it necessary to facilitate access to. HIROKO stabs the exterior helmet control. The COMPUTER VOICE ceases, while the BEEPING from the tracker rises in both pitch and volume. Whatever the signals are, they're almost on top of her. HIROKO turns to the narrow entry duct. It's position makes it virtually impossible to get back into. She tries anyhow. BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP! A rush of displaced water flood into the chamber, flattening her against the wall. DARK SHAPES THUNDER past the other side of the grille like express trains in the night.going away from HIROKO. She twitches in fear and disbelief as the BLOBS on the monitor screen recede and finally disappear. The tracker's pitch returns to it's hollow CLICKING.

Removal of restraining bolts is necessary to facilitate access to venturi ducts. There's only one recourse left to her. She jams down the thumb KER-SLAM! The force of the rivet-gun propels her backwards, her internal suit-pressure making her rise to the surface. She wipes the slime from her helmet yet again. .And finds herself staring at an ALIEN EGG, it's top cracking open in four neat sections. The FACEHUGGER leaps straight as her faceplate. .And misses, it's fingers failing to gain purchase on the slippery dome. HIROKO kicks away from the spindly creature as it orientates itself on the water's surface, it's powerful tail propelling itself back toward her. It contracts on itself, preparing to leap. HIROKO raises the power-tool, reflexively squeezing the trigger again and again. Fat rivets RIP through the FACEHUGGER's body. It writhes around on the water's surface, a cloud ofyellow acid billowing outward from it. HIROKO dives into the water again. She rams the power-tool at the final bolt. BZZZZ! It's out! She levers-off the grille. Forces herself into the confined space beyond.
HIROKO: INT. RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER Everybody in admin registers astonishment as her voice comes over the HIROKO ( CONT'D ) ( O.S., on speakers ) .Can all uncross your fingers. A WHOOP goes up. Various hands are SLAPPED.

PARSONS: DRISCOLL's moving even as PARSONS speaks.
DRISCOLL: EXT. RHUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT HIROKO reaches the top and sprints along the catwalk towards the Control Cab. She narrowly misses something metallic near the base of the handrail. If she'd taken the time to stop and look, she would have seen BROKEN TUSK's ruined wrist computer.
HIROKO: She finds it. Gets her fingers in the groove and slides it out. Beneath is a mini-disk drive with two buttons.
PARSONS: INT. RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP - CRAWLER CAB Everybody from Auto-shop is crammed into the two articulated vehicles. GUTTIEREZ sits in the driver's seat of the first crawler. He glances out of the side window. MATT gives him a 'thumbs-up' from the cab of the second crawler. GUTTIEREZ ( into headset ) Say the word, and you won't see our asses for dust.

DRISCOLL: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT HIROKO runs back across the catwalk. She might have missed the PREDATOR's damaged computer before, but she doesn't this time. Her foot comes down on it and she slips. The gun goes flying from her hand. HIROKO watches in horror as it teeters on the catwalk's edge for a moment.
HIROKO: .Then goes over. She drops to all fours and peers over the side. Luckily it's only fallen about four feet onto a dirty ledge. She reaches out for it.
GUTTIEREZ: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT KER-SMASM! GUTTIEREZ' crawler rams the other vehicle off the roadway and through the platform safety barrier. It balances precariously for a second, until finally it's weight sends it plunging into the swamp in a CACOPHONY of STRESSED METAL and CRUMBLING CONCRETE.
MATT: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT Holding the cracked mask to his face, BROKEN TUSK looks up at the gigantic crane moving against the night sky.
DE VRIES: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT HIROKO leaps the last few rungs from the moving crane onto the platform. She dashes towards the hoverbike, some thirty feet away. With no time to loose, she slides her boots into the foot-supports, which automatically WHIRR closed. Gropes for the ignition key. Before she's even located it, the hoverbike moves. SCRAPING across the concrete. ALIEN claws appear around the edge of one of the bike's manta wings. She's parked the bike over a drainage exit! HIROKO SPINS the key and guns the engine. The white-hot downblast from the turbine exhaust SPLASHES across the SCREECHING ALIENS. The vehicle tilts and KICKS forward.
CATWALK P.O.V.,: INT. RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT A blinking message on the crane's monitor screen:
PARSONS: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT The crane hoists the module aloft, free of it's umbilicals.
GUTTIEREZ: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES exit the crawler in a big hurry. The moment they're clear, the vehicle starts up and is gone. DE VRIES is alert, the tip of her rifle probing their surroundings.
DE VRIES: GUTTIEREZ begins climbing the tall ladder running up to the Bertha's EXT. RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT HIROKO's running along the platform, pistol clenched firmly in hand. She thumbs her headset.
HIROKO: INT. RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER CASSIE answers, holding on to the edge of her console.
CASSIE: HIROKO's VOICE interrupts. HIROKO ( O.S., on speakers ) I've lost the bike and I'm cut-off.
CASSIE: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT The heli-jet pad's just up ahead. The relief on HIROKO's face is INT. BIG BERTHA - NIGHT GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES pile inside the surprisingly cramped driver's cab. There's a seat up-front, with another behind a small control fascia pointing out-back. DE VRIES hands over her rifle and slides into the rear. She flicks on an overhead light. Taped to one side is a black-and-white magazine cut-out of a naked male body-builder.

DE VRIES: She gives the control board a cursory once-over. GUTTIEREZ calls back from his vantage point at the doorway.
GUTTIEREZ: DE VRIES powers-up the console.
DE VRIES: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - NIGHT HIROKO runs towards the waiting heli-jet. The flicker of an andrenalin-fueled smile plays on her face.the disappears. Like a scorpion scuttling over a rock, the ALIEN climbs up on top of the grounded machine. It's head turn towards her. HIROKO starts to raise her pistol. then stops. Other ALIENS are descending the nearby navigation tower. straight for her. HIROKO turns tail. She races over to a ladder running up the side of a building and begins to climb.
GUTTIEREZ: DE VRIES EXT. RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT HIROKO takes flight across the rooftops with the ALIENS in pursuit like a pack of dogs. She vaults extractor intakes and retrofitted junk with ease. So do the ALIENS. She cuts across a conduit overpass bridging two buildings across the main street, trying not to lose her footing. Just before reaching the other side, HIROKO slips and falls to her knees. Her headset drops thirty feet onto the concrete roadway. Her hand rests on something red. It's the cover for the explosive bolts connecting the conduit to the building. She scrambles onto the rooftop and flips over the hatch. Glances up. The ALIENS are already starting across. She pulls the primer cylinder out by it's handle. Jams it into the detonator, and She's practically on top of the bolts. The EXPLOSION is DEAFENING. With the clamp on this side free, the conduit falls into the street with a SCREECH of twisted metal. One of the ALIENS is pulverized by the falling debris, but the others survive. All HIROKO's managed to do is buy herself some breathing space. She races across the building's roof. Reaches the other side.straight into a dead end.

DE VRIES: GUTTIEREZ looses one last volley at the ALIENS. He pulls the cab door shut, and throws himself into the driver's seat.
GUTTIEREZ: EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT Bertha's wheels GRIND to life, spilling ALIENS and crushing them under it's treads.
GUTTIEREZ: DE VRIES hits the floor. The thick boughs impact with the cab, SHATTERING the safety glass.
HIROKO: coming to my rescue. they never looked like you. The PREDATOR turns away, seemingly uninterested.
KAMEN: HIROKO fearfully says something beneath her breath in JAPANESE. UP ON THE WALL, BROKEN TUSK has finished his task. He slides the tip of a claw across the self-destruct mechanism. It's readout display illuminates with alien characters. He activates a button, and the readout begins to blink. BELOW, KAMEN is talking to a sickened HIROKO.
HIROKO: BROKEN TUSK appears as HIROKO's shoulder. He raises his right arm.
KAMEN: BROKEN TUSK appears as HIROKO's shoulder. He raises his right arm.
HIROKO: BROKEN TUSK appears as HIROKO's shoulder. He raises his right arm.
KAMEN: BROKEN TUSK appears as HIROKO's shoulder. He raises his right arm.
HIROKO: BROKEN TUSK appears as HIROKO's shoulder. He raises his right arm.
SCHNICK!: face. BROKEN TUSK grabs her arm roughly and pulls her away.
HIROKO: INT. RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER The alien numbers on the PREDATOR self-destruct readout inexorably count down.
HIROKO: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN behind. The landing pad is made up of an intricate series of grilles designed to deflect downward exhaust gases. HIROKO's feet CLATTER across the metal. KER-SMASH! The metal is SMASHED from beneath, right in front of her. The IMMATURE ALIEN QUEEN has made is out of the sewer system and has got the jump on them. HIROKO's forward momentum won't allow her to stop running.she's too close. Almost at the last moment, she jumps. claws brush her trouser leg, but close on thin air. She hits the deck and quickly closes the last few feet to the chopper. BROKEN TUSK stops. ALIENS are appearing all over the pad and out of nearby drainage ducts.
HIROKO: EXT. RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN BROKEN TUSK scales the ladder as quickly as he can. As the top of the tower is a gallery catwalk surrounding the flashing beacon array. The IMMATURE QUEEN, accompanied by a phalanx of warrior ALIENS, is almost upon him. The PREDATOR drives his wrist knives into the throat of a grasping ALIEN, which falls downward, writhing. It CRASHES into the QUEEN, who almost loses her grip on the skeletal metalwork. She HISSES, lashing out at the creature. Sends it hurtling to the ground.
HIROKO: BROKEN TUSK looks down. It's a long drop.but it's the best option available to him. He jumps. THWACK! His hands grip the door frame. The heli-jet wobbles slightly, it's center of gravity shifting. BROKEN TUSK hauls himself up and through the door as. .KER-BLAM! A massive explosion mushrooms up from the base as the storage tanks below ignite. The shock wave buffets the chopper against the tower.
HIROKO: BROKEN TUSK turns towards her.
HIROKO: BROKEN TUSK goes for the trigger. His index finger won't slide into the trigger guard.it's too big! He takes the guard in both hands and exerts pressure. SNAP. Problem solved.
BROKEN TUSK: BLAM! A round open a nice, neat hole in the QUEEN's head. She YOWLS. BLAM! A second round does the job. The QUEEN relinquishes her grip and falls, SCREECHING all the way down into the raging inferno below.
MATT: INT. CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN Gauges and other instruments are going crazy as the heli-jet rides the turbulence out.
HIROKO: EXT. CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN The chopper clips the tree boughs, and bounces.
HIROKO: EXT. SWAMP - DAWN The sun begins to rise as HIROKO exits the heli-jet and goes around to the other side. She manages to get the mangled door open. BROKEN TUSK's wound looks even worse up-close.
BROKEN TUSK: And with that, the PREDATOR dies. HIROKO look around. The sun is rising above the treetops, and the setting is serene. Somehow beautiful. The speakers in the heli-jet cabin CRACKLE to life, jarring her. VOICE ( O.S., on speakers ) Rimward Tracking Station, this is the one thirty-second Rim Corp Battalion operating out of the cruiser Tartarus from Fort Powell. Please respond. Over. There's a sound O.S., like a THUNDERCLAP. HIROKO surveys the horizon. HIROKO's P.O.V. A pair of MARINE DROPSHIPS float above the distant rainforest, their weapons arms unfurled like exotic armed insects. Searchlights probe the ground far below. A shadow falls over HIROKO, blocking out the sun. A monstrous SHAPE occupies the air above, delineated only by a telltale vibration. The PREDATOR shuttlecraft lowers it's cloaking device, extending landing gear and a ramp. It touches down in the bayou with scarcely a whisper. HIROKO watches the PREDATORS file slowly out. BROKEN TUSK's body is borne aloft and carried back inside. The LEAD PREDATOR turns to HIROKO. He crosses to her. HIROKO's face is reflected in the faceted eyepieces of the PREDATOR's helmet. The extraterrestrial hunter pulls out his telescopic spear. KER-CHUNK! The tips lock into place. The PREDATOR offers it to HIROKO. She accepts, a little confused. There's a long moment. The PREDATOR is still standing there. Waiting. HIROKO's eyes narrow. Her mind is working furiously. What do they She realises. It suddenly becomes clear. She smiles.
HIROKO: HIROKO glances back at the hovering DROPSHIPS, then walks around the waiting PREDATOR and into the shuttlecraft without looking back. The PREDATOR follows her. The ramp SLAMS closed, as we.
