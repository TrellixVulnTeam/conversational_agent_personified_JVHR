GO!: On the estate - as the power goes out. The team on the mansion's front porch pops the door and pours in.
SOLDIER: ( in Russian ) Get up, now! Up!
PETROV: ( in Russian ) Thank you for joining us this evening.
TRANSLATOR: ( V.0. earpiece ) Has chosen to join our fight against tyranny in forging a new world community. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the President of the United States of America.
DOHERTY: Maybe we should consider running him for re-election instead of the U.S.
MARSHALL: ( in Russian with subtitles ) Good evening and thank you. First I would ask you to join me in a moment of silence for the victims of the Turkmenistan massacres.
MARSHALL: As you know, three weeks ago American Special Forces, in cooperation with the Russian Republican Army, secured the arrest of Turkmenistan's self- proclaimed dictator, General Ivan Stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic reign had given new meaning to the word horror. I am proud to say our operation was a success. And now, yesterday's biggest threat to world peace. today awaits trial for crimes against humanity.
MARSHALL: And now, yesterday's biggest threat to world peace. today awaits trial for crimes against humanity.
MARSHALL: What we did here was important. We finally pulled our heads out of the sand, we finally stood up to the brutality and said "We've had enough. Every time we ignore these atrocities the rapes, the death squads, the genocides- every time we negotiate with these, these thugs to keep them out of gig country and away from gig families, every time we do thiS.E. we legitimize terror.
GIBBS: Gentlemen, welcome to Air Force One.
KORSHUNOV: We've already been inspected.
GIBBS: Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
KORSHUNOV: Of course. I'm sorry.
GIBBS: Please place your thumbs on the ID
SHEPHERD: CBS said they'll
MARSHALL: I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
DOHERTY: Sir, you threw out page two.
MARSHALL: Goddamn right I did. I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit. What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
DOHERTY: It was a good ad-lib, sir.
MARSHALL: Thanks. Wrote it last night.
WALTERS: Equipment checks out.
GIBBS: Gentlemen, this is Maria Mitchell.
KORSHUNOV: Ms. Mitchell. So nice to finally meet you in person.
MITCHELL: The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you. Now if you're all cleared? You can follow me then.
MITCHELL: I'll be giving
SHEPHERD: You wanna knock of f?
MARSHALL: No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
SHEPHERD: He and the NRA don't like the wording.
DOHERTY: Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be. Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
MARSHALL: Put together a score sheet. I'll make some calls.
SHEPHERD: With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one. Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail I might still have a few chips left.
MARSHALL: I might still have a few chips left.
SHEPHERD: We could always
MARSHALL: This is a crime bill, Shep. Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee. Besides, Shep, I told you. I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
SHEPHERD: Other way around, sir.
MARSHALL: ( realizing what he said ) Right. Christ I'm tired. Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
SHEPHERD: This is the part I wanted you to Criminal. One of our boys died in Marshall's little publicity stunt and for what? So we could claim victory over another country's problems instead of our own? And now he's got the nerve to prance around Moscow gloating, while that poor boy's family is left to bury him. If I were Marshall, I'd be ashamed of myself.
LARRY KING: There you have it. Harsh words for the President from Michael Danforth, the Speaker of the House.
SHEPHERD: My opinion.
MARSHALL: It's bait. Don't take it.
SHEPHERD: Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television. You can't afford to leave that hanging.
MARSHALL: ( ignoring Shepherd ) Did we tape the Duke game?
AIDE: It's waiting on the plane. The ending was pretty.
MARSHALL: ( interrupting ) Please don't tell me. Just for once, let me be
MITCHELL: Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth. We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations. We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
KORSHUNOV: This is a remarkable aircraft.
MITCHELL: You don't know the half of it. Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation? We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
KORSHUNOV: A dubious distinction, no?
MITCHELL: I guess it depends on your
KORSHUNOV: And all these rooms here?
MITCHELL: Conference rooms, though some have other functions. The one up front doubles as an emergency medical
MITCHELL: As you can see, back here's more like a regular plane. Security and Secret Service take this cabin. You'll be in the rear with the press
MITCHELL: Here's a press kit. I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
KORSHUNOV: Thank you. You fellas win some sort of fly-with- POTUS contest?
REPORTER: You fellas win some sort of fly-with- POTUS contest?
KORSHUNOV: Potus? What is Potus?
REPORTER: P.O.T.U.S. President Of The United Ah, no. We won nothing. We are ITAR-TASS news service.
KORSHUNOV: Ah, no. We won nothing. We are ITAR-TASS news service.
REPORTER: Right. Listen, this here. This is my row. You'll have to sit over
COL. AXELROD: Welcome aboard, Mr. President.
MARSHALL: ( returns salute ) Hey Danny. How's it look tonight?
COL. AXELROD: Glassy, sir. Care to take the wheel?
MARSHALL: You keep offering, one of these days I'll take you up on it. Rose and Alice back yet?
AIDE: No, Mr. President. The ballet ran late. Their ETA is seventeen minutes.
SHEPHERD: Mr. President?
MARSHALL: Thirty seconds.
MARSHALL: Shepherd enters.
SHEPHERD: Can I at least issue a press release objecting to the Speaker's choice of I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please.
MARSHALL: I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please.
SHEPHERD: We'll just say it was in bad taste.
MARSHALL: Forget it, Shep. The kid gave his life for his country and Speaker's a bastard for turning him into a sound bite. I'll take the heat. Understood?
SHEPHERD: You give me ulcers.
MARSHALL: That's my job.
STEWARD: Mr. President?
MARSHALL: Hey Mike. Could you get me a No, wait. Get him one of the Russian
SHEPHERD: No, wait. Get him one of the Russian
SHEPHERD: We've got those Russian news guys on board and it'll look good in the C'mon Shep. I've been eating borscht and drinking vodka for days. Isn't that enough? New home starts are down. Fill this with Heineken.
MARSHALL: C'mon Shep. I've been eating borscht and drinking vodka for days. Isn't that enough? New home starts are down. Fill this with Heineken.
MARSHALL: Fill this with Heineken.
STEWARD: Yes, Mr. President.
MARSHALL: I don't believe this. I'm playing politics with a bottle of beer. A goddamn bottle of beer. I've been in office too long.
SHEPHERD: Look on the bright side. if the polls don't change, you won't have that problem, sir.
MARSHALL: Yeah. Put the Duke game on in my Yes, Mr. President.
MARSHALL: ( to Shepherd ) Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour. I want to review the Iraq situation.
SHEPHERD: Yes, sir.
MARSHALL: Get me the Housing Secretary.
ROSE: C'mon Alice, we're 20 minutes late.
ALICE: It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
ROSE: Well, you aren't the President, dear.
ALICE: Yeah, no duh.
ROSE: Why don't you go say hi?
ROSE: What is wrong with you tonight? Come here.
ROSE: You don't want to say hi to your I'm sure he's busy.
ALICE: I'm sure he's busy.
ROSE: Don't you even want to ask?
ALICE: If I go over there to say hi to daddy President, Mike's going to tell me he's in a meeting and can't be disturbed. Then when the plane starts to taxi, he'll come out and say "Hey, are you guys back? Did you enjoy the ballet?" But he'll be on his way to another meeting and won't wait for an answer. Then you'll get pissed at him and he'll get pissed at you. It's like you guys rehearse or something.
ALICE: Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
ROSE: Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
ALICE: Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
ROSE: You're jet-lagged. We'll talk about this back.
ALICE: Back at The Fishbowl?
ROSE: We'll talk at home. You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you. For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
ALICE: I know, Mom. It was great. really.
ALICE: He's in a meeting. He can't be I'm sorry, honey.
ROSE: I'm sorry, honey.
ALICE: No, it's okay. After all, he is the President, right?
ALICE: When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
ROSE: Your father never means to be so.
ALICE: I know. But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world. Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh. I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
ROSE: Some kids were teasing you?
ALICE: That's not really the point.
ROSE: You're right and I'll tell you a secret. I know exactly how you feel.
ALICE: Big secret. You said the same thing to Newsweek.
ALICE: We're taxiing. Ready. And. five. four. three.. two. one. Cue
ALICE: Oooooh, I'm good.
MARSHALL: Hey, you guys back already?
MARSHALL: How was. .the ballet?
ALICE: ( theatrically ) It was the experience of a lifetime.
MARSHALL: How `bout a hug for the old man.
SHEPHERD: Mr. President. they're ready for you in the conference room.
MARSHALL: Okay. Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
ALICE: As Marshall moves toward the conference room, he bends and gives Rose a quick peck on the cheek. It all reeks of
ROSE: May I speak to you for a moment?
MARSHALL: Can't it wait?
ROSE: No, Mr. President. It can't.
ROSE: Don't. I know spin control when I feel it.
MARSHALL: Rose, I don't have time for this.
ROSE: For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy. Not even you can plug all the world's leaks. Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
MARSHALL: She's a big girl. She understands.
ROSE: How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
MARSHALL: And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule. What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
ROSE: No. It wasn't.
MARSHALL: You know what?
ROSE: I miss you. And I miss her.
MARSHALL: I miss you. And I miss her.
ROSE: But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
MARSHALL: I wish it were that easy. I'll make it up to you, I promise.
MARSHALL: I'll make it up to you, I promise.
ROSE: I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
MARSHALL: This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
ROSE: How did your speech go?
MARSHALL: Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign. Mr. President.
MARSHALL: Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
ROSE: Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
SHEPHERD: She is scheduled. Her school play's Tuesday night.
MARSHALL: The First Lady was making a joke, Shep. I'll make some time, Rose. I
COL. AXELROD: Roger, Tower. And thank you for the
MAJOR CALDWELL: Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized They've gotta be joking.
MARSHALL: They've gotta be joking.
DOHERTY: The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
MARSHALL: An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
MAJOR CALDWELL: The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
MARSHALL: Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for

MARSHALL: What about my family?
MARSHALL: SECRET SERVICE AGENT ( cutting him off )

COT. AXELROD: Copy Ramstein. We are dropping to five thousand feet, beginning final Daddy? Dad?
NEVSKY: Your father has left you behind.
ROSE: Gunfire from ROSE, who holds the dead secret service agent's weapon. She empties the clip at the doorway. Click, click. No more bullets. Korshunov steps into the room, brandishing his automatic, smiling. Rose backs against the wall and raises her hands.

ZEDECK: That's it?
GIBBS: To fly a 747 you need to know three things. How to take of f, how to land, and how to engage the autopilot.
KORSHUNOV: The rest of the secret service?
GIBBS: How many others killed?
KORSHUNOV: How many others killed?
GIBBS: Any of us?
KORSHUNOV: Any of us?
GIBBS: No damages.
ROSE: Where's my daughter?
GIBBS: She's alive, ma'am, for the time
ROSE: And my husband?
GIBBS: The secret service did their job, ma'am. The President is safely off the plane. But that still leaves us plenty to bargain with.
ROSE: Mr. Gibbs. You, of all people.
GIBBS: Follow me, ma'am.
V.P. CHANDLER: We should have the President secure within minutes. Do we know who these terrorists are or where they're going?
GENERAL NORTHWOOD: General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
V.P. CHANDLER: Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
DEAN: The garners believe that, given the scenario, there's an 86% chance that
V.P. CHANDLER: If we're dealing with an airborne hostage situation what's our
LEE: Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane. Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
V.P. CHANDLER: Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane. Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.

V.P. CHANDLER: AIR FORCE COLONEL V.P. CHANDLER
V.P. CHANDLER: Thank you, Colonel. Have a seat.
COL. CARLTON: Roger. We all wish. Now shut the fuck up and escort.
NEVSKY: Every weapon and every person is accounted for.
KORSHUNOV: Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
ROSE: What do you want with us?
KORSHUNOV: Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
DOHERTY: This can't be happening. You just don't pull this shit with the United States. You just don't.
MAJOR CALDWELL: Keep your heads.
SHEPHERD: Mrs. Marshall, are you okay?
ROSE: We're alive.
SHEPHERD: That's all that matters. Thank god the President got of f the plane.
ROSE: Yes. thank God. You there. Caidwell, right? What's on your mind? caldwell takes a beat, then crosses to Rose and Shepherd.
MAJOR CALDWELL: ( hushed ) I don't want to get anybody here excited, but if we can get out of this room, I can get us to safety.
SHEPHERD: We're thirty five thousand feet up.
MAJOR CALDWELL: Yes, sir, that's a problem, but if we can somehow get to a lower altitude, the rear loading ramp on the baggage deck is equipped with parachutes in case of an engine failure. Now we can either wait for a political resolution, or try to resolve this thing ourselves.
DOHERTY: You're goddamn right we can resolve this ourselves. We'll negotiate.
SHEPHERD: You know the President's policy.
DOHERTY: The President isn't here.
ROSE: Right now we are an enormous liability to the United States. We can't just sit and do nothing.
VIAD: Standing guard, facing the opposite
KORSHUNOV: Gibbs works the communications board, dialing in a series of numbers. Telephone ringing.
V.P. CHANDLER: Find that voice for me, I want to know who we're dealing with. And get President Petrov on the phone.

DEAN: We don't know that.

DEAN: That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
V.P. CHANDLER: So what are you saying?
DEAN: Maybe he's alive on that plane and those bastards don't even know it.
V.P. CHANDLER: Mr. Dean, may I remind you that the President is not 19 anymore.
MARSHALL: He steps on some glass. It's a broken frame holding a PHOTOGRAPH of Alice and Rose. He picks up the photo and lays it on a table. He thinks for a beat. glances around the room, searching. Then he crosses to the closet, opens it and begins rifling through his wardrobe.
MAJOR CALDWELL: This is a dead end.
VLAD: Get on the floor, now!
VIAD: ( wonderment ) The President.
MARSHALL: That's right, asshole.
VLAD: Don't move or I'll blow your head off.
MARSHALL: I don't think so.
MARSHALL: Marshall catches his breath for a moment. Pulls open his shirt. Beneath it he wears a bulletproof Kevlar vest. He lifts the vest and a half-dozen angry welts have blossomed across his skin. The stuff may be bulletproof, but each of Vlad's shots sting like a motherfucker.
NEVSKY: INT. STAFF CABIN. Marshall opens the medical cabinets, rifling through them. Pulls out hypodermics, adrenalin, rubbing alcohol. arming

KORSHUNOV: Go after him.
SERGE: I know you're in there. Come on out. Okay. Have it your way.
MARSHALL: The NRA'll love this.
PETROV: I understand your dilemma, Vice President Chandler. But unless you can confirm that your President is indeed a hostage, I cannot release Stravanavitch. If Marshall is dead, no good will come of meeting this demand. We both know he would agree.
PETROV: .. is not a First Lady if her husband's been killed. Then she's a civilian. And I can't release him for a civilian. Do you see my point?
LEE: Madame Vice president. We have an options paper. chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
V.P. CHANDLER: Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
V.P. CHANDLER: By then I'll be President.
V.P. CHANDLER: ( of f options paper ) I don't like any of these. from, did you brief General Northwood?
GENERAL NORTHWOOD: I'M INCLINED TO TRY THIS PART - Anticipate their landing site and get strike teams in place.
V.P. CHANDLER: Can we do that?
GENERAL NORTHWOOD: We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
V.P. CHANDLER: But they start executing hostages in
GENERAL NORTHWOOD: I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
V.P. CHANDLER: Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
DEAN: Madame Vice-President.
V.P. CHANDLER: I've not discounted your theory Hr. No. I got the new numbers from our gamers. They believe that there's only an eight percent chance that the President is still alive.
DEAN: No. I got the new numbers from our gamers. They believe that there's only an eight percent chance that the President is still alive.
V.P. CHANDLER: Eight percent is better than zero.
GENERAL GREELY: That's trouble.
V.P. CHANDLER: Would someone get the Press Secretary!
AIDE: He's been holding on line four.
KORSHUNOV: Who did this?
GIBBS: We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
KORSHUNOV: A secret service agent. It must be. The conference room is no longer secure. We'll take the First Lady and the girl up top where we can keep a closer eye on them.
KORSHUNOV: The conference room is no longer secure. We'll take the First Lady and the girl up top where we can keep a closer eye on them.
KORSHUNOV: Admirable, but you're wasting your Mrs. Marshall, would you and your daughter please come here.
KORSHUNOV: Now, or he dies, please.
ROSE: Come on, Alice.
ALICE: I'm scared. You've got the better part of the White House locked in this room, you know. If you want to negotiate, we're the ones to do it with. Mrs. Marshall. Alice. If you please.
DOHERTY: You've got the better part of the White House locked in this room, you know. If you want to negotiate, we're the ones to do it with. Mrs. Marshall. Alice. If you please.
KORSHUNOV: Mrs. Marshall. Alice. If you please.
ROSE: It's okay. Do what you're told. It's okay. We'll be okay.

MARSHALL: Yes, the number for the White House.
ALICE: I don't drink coffee.
KORSHUNOV: You must be tired. It'll wake you No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
ALICE: No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
ROSE: Leave my daughter alone.
KORSHUNOV: Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall? But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand.
ROSE: What do you know of my husband?
KORSHUNOV: I know he left you behind.
ROSE: My husband is a very courageous man.
KORSHUNOV: Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
ALICE: You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
KORSHUNOV: So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings. along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
ALICE: Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings. along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
KORSHUNOV: Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word "propaganda" means?
ALICE: Yeah. Do you know what the word "asshole" means.
ROSE: Rose doesn't know whether to be pissed at Alice or proud of her. Korshunov smiles, nods his head and lifts his gun.
KORSHUNOV: Yes, I have heard that word.
KORSHUNOV: Yes, I am an asshole.
KORSHUNOV: Your father is a reasonable man.
SWITCHBOARD: White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
MARSHALL: ( hushed urgency ) Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
SWITCHBOARD: who can I say is calling?
SWITCHBOARD: Yeah, right.
MARSHALL: Don't cut me off. This is an Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
SWITCHBOARD: Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
MARSHALL: You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
SWITCHBOARD: Okay. if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
MARSHALL: Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the..

BAZ YLEV: Hands away from your weapon.
BAZYLEV: Come now. You don't want to die.
BAZYLEV: On your knees.
BAZYUV: What's that in your shirt? Open it.
BAZYLEV: Take it off. Now.
V.P. CHANDLER: My intention is not to escalate the situation, but it's a contigency that must be considered. Hang on. The switchboard says that someone called in claiming to be the President, then she heard gunfire.
AIDE: The switchboard says that someone called in claiming to be the President, then she heard gunfire.
DEAN: Could be some crank watching CNN.
AIDE: No sir. Trace confirms the call is Coming from a White House staff cellular account.
V.P. CHANDLER: Put it through down here. Hang on, Toni.
V.P. CHANDLER: What's going on in the background?
DEAN: Max, get me Willis.
WILLIS: Tracking. Intercepting call. Got it. Ten seconds, Mr. Dean.
V.P. CHANDLER: It's him. He is alive.
BAZYLEV: I'm going to take your weapon now, and then I'm going to take you Upstairs to join the others. Christ, they have him.
DEAN: Christ, they have him.
BAZYLEV: And if you make any sudden moves, I will not hesitate to shoot.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD: Maybe they don't have him yet.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD: And maybe we aren't so helpless.
GENERAL NORTPNOOD: General Greely, Air Force One has automatic countermeasures, right?
GENERAL GREELY: Everything we own is in that plane.
GENERAL NORTINOOD: So a single missile launched from a distance should be a mere distraction.
GENERAL GREELY: GENERAL NORTHWOOD ( into phone )
GENERAL NORTHWOOD: ( into phone ) Ramutein Tower Control, please.
GENERAL GREELY: ( getting it ) But the effect could be jarring.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD: Exactly. Ramstein? General Northwood. Patch me through to your fighters. Madame Vice President. with your permission?
V.P. CHANDLER: Do it.
BAZ YLEV: So you're the President. Somehow, I thought you'd be smaller.
BAZYLEV: Not so powerful now, eh? No aides to advise you, no secret service to protect you, no armies to command.

BAZYLEV: You will walk ahead. slowly. Do you understand? Do you understand!
MARSHALL: Do you know what's going to happen to you because of this? Do you know what the world will do?
BAZYLEV: Nothing. The world will do nothing.

ALICE: I'm sorry I was so mean to you
ROSE: I know, sweetie. I know. You're being very brave.
SERGE: ( to Zedeck ) He's not up here. I'm going down Did they say anything about my family?
MARSHALL: Did they say anything about my family?
V.P. CHANDLER: They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
MARSHALL: Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
V.P. CHANDLER: and if that means negotiating.
MARSHALL: You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
V.P. CHANDLER: But this is different, sir. You're the President.
MARSHALL: And what happens when Stravanavitch is freed and discovers he's got the President? You think for a second that that crazy bastard is just gonna turn me over? He'll ask for the goddamn moon before he's done.
V.P. CHANDLER: Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that. I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office. We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
MARSHALL: Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that. I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office. We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
MARSHALL: flow, is there a rescue operation under way or not?
LEE: He's not on a secure line.
DEAN: I'm here, Mr. President.
MARSHALL: Where's the cavalry?
DEAN: We can't do anything until that plane lands. And when it does land, sir, it's going to be in hostile territory. To be perfectly honest, we don't know what the hell to do.
MARSHALL: I'll see what I can do.
SERGE: Bazylev is dead.
AND THE: Trapped On the baggage deck. Let me go finish him.
SERGE: Trapped On the baggage deck. Let me go finish him.
KORSHUNOV: No. He has the advantage down there.
SERGE: You. Come with me.
MARSHALL: What the hell.
MARSHALL: ( murmuring ) Out of fuel.
MARSHALL: Come on, where are you.
KORSHUNOV: Ms. Mitchell. Hello again.
ROSE: Korshunov switches on the airplane's P.A.
KORSHUNOV: Please tell me
MITCHELL: ( frightened ) Maria. Maria Mitchell.
KORSHUNOV: And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.

KORSHUNOV: And why are you scared?
MITCHELL: Because. because I don't want to
KORSHUNOV: And what am I doing at this very
MITCHELL: You're pointing a gun at me.
KORSHUNOV: Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
KORSHUNOV: Now, to the secret service agent in the baggage deck. I'm giving you ten seconds to surrender, or this women will die.
KORSHUNOV: Oh shit. Marshall tries to decide what to do.
KORSHUNOV: He climbs out of the avionics compartment and hurries to the front baggage compartment.
KORSHUNOV: INT. MAIN CABIN. Zedeck and Serge wait by the stairway hatch.
KORSHUNOV: INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM. Hostages wait, expectantly.
KORSHUNOV: INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD. Marshall frozen near the bottom of the steps. To go up would be to betray everything he believes in, and lose any chance to save the others. But if he stays.
KORSHUNOV: INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER. Tears stream down Maria Mitchell's face. She's trying so hard to be brave in front of Rose and Alice.
KORSHUNOV: INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD. For Marshall, this is the hardest decision of his life. His face a mask of anguish as he wrestles with his conscience.
KORSHUNOV: He starts toward the stairs.
KORSHUNOV: INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD. It takes every bit of training and will to stop Marshall from going up those stairs. He knows what's going to happen. He closes his eyes tight as if that will stop it from A long silent beat. Then. BAAAAM!
KORSHUNOV: A long silent beat. Then. BAAAAM!
MARSHALL: Marshall sinks to to his knees.
NO!: Marshall sinks to to his knees.
MARSHALL: Aw, Jesus.
MARSHALL: ( to himself ) She was important.
ROSE: Do you have to be so brutal?
KORSHUNOV: Why? Do you enjoy it?
ROSE: Why? Do you enjoy it?
KORSHUNOV: I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
ROSE: How can you? I mean they're people.
KORSHUNOV: But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes. but they were not your people.
ROSE: That was war.
KORSHUNOV: So is this. Come now, you're upsetting the little The woman you shot. She was my friend.
ALICE: The woman you shot. She was my friend.
KORSHUNOV: That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in
VOICE: ( through static ) Chief Mechanic, 87th Air. How can I help you?
MARSHALL: You can talk me through an emergency fuel dump.
MAJOR CALDWELL: Led off to slaughter one at a time.
SHEPHERD: They can shoot enough of us.
MAJOR CALDWELL: If we don't act, they'll kill US all eventually Who's with me?
CHIEF MECHANIC: Do you see the maintenance panel?
MARSHALL: Got it.
CHIEF MECHANIC: Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
MARSHALL: Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
CHIEF MECHANIC: Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
MARSHALL: Got `en.
CHIEF MECHANIC: Okay, hang on. Let me double check
MARSHALL: I'll wait.
CHIEF MECHANIC: First. cut. green wire.
MARSHALL: It's cut.
CHIEF MECHANIC: cross it. The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.

MARSHALL: An emergency landing in friendly territory. there's your goddamn
GIBBS: Goddamnit it. We're losing fuel.
KORSHUNOV: Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
GIBBS: Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
KORSHUNOV: ( to Zedeck ) Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
ZEDECK: He's down here. I can feel it.
SERGE: Shut up and do your job.
ZEDECK: You see him?
SERGE: Erring on the side of caution.
ZEDECK: I'm going to deactivate the by-pass pump. It'll take a minute.
GIBBS: We've stopped dumping. but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
KORSHUNOV: We're not going to make it.
GIBBS: Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
KORSHUNOV: Where are we now?
GIBBS: Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
KORSHUNOV: No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe. The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and. refuels in mid-air. Call the White
AIDE: It's him again.
KORSHUNOV: Gentlemen, forgive me for diverting you from your little wargames, but I've just added another demand to my very short list. I assure you it's quite reasonable.
LEE: Finally, we can bargain.
V.P. CHANDLER: I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
KORSHUNOV: No. The plane lands when I say, or it will crash. The hostages are released when I say, or they will Tell me what I want to hear or I will execute a member of the senior staff, and will continue killing one hostage every minute until we crash or until a refueling plane arrives.
KORSHUNOV: Tell me what I want to hear or I will execute a member of the senior staff, and will continue killing one hostage every minute until we crash or until a refueling plane arrives.
KORSHUNOV: Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right Say something dear.
ROSE: Say something dear.
KORSHUNOV: Say something dear.
ALICE: Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
KORSHUNOV: It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
KORSHUNOV: Well? What do you say?
KORSHUNOV: We trained for months. Everything should've gone like clockwork.
ZEDECK: We have the hostages, we're getting more fuel.
KORSHUNOV: He's already killed three of us, and we haven't even seen him. He's also shown that he can hurt us. I need to What the hell are you doing up here?
MARSHALL: Don't make the same mistake your friend did earlier. Show me your
MARSHALL: Open the door.
MARSHALL: It's me goddamnit. Let me go.
SHEPHERD: Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
MARSHALL: I never left. Where's my wife and They took `em out. They're probably on the upper deck.
MAJOR CALDWELL: They took `em out. They're probably on the upper deck.
SHEPHERD: Mr. President, Major Caldwell here has a plan to get these hostages of f the plane.
MARSHALL: I dumped most of the fuel. They'll land soon and Delta will take its A refueling plane is already on it's way so we won't be landing until we reach Turkmenistan. Your best course of action is to release me. I will be merciful.
SERGE: A refueling plane is already on it's way so we won't be landing until we reach Turkmenistan. Your best course of action is to release me. I will be merciful.
MARSHALL: Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
MAJOR CALDWELL: INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - Satellite pictures of various landing strips projected on wall-sized monitors.
DEAN: Of the three dozen airports in Turkmenistan, only five have sufficient runways for a 747. Of those five, only these three have shown any activity.
GENERAL NORTPNOOD: But this one here, see this. It's a satellite dish and it wasn't there two weeks ago. Basic communications uplink, which suggests extensive communicatins ability. I'd say this was the one.
V.P. CHANDLER: Are you confident you can take the It's night there for a few more hours. That's a real plus. But I won't lie. As far as special ops go, this one's a bear, but I think we squeeze it Let's get it going.
GENERAL NORTIWOOD: It's night there for a few more hours. That's a real plus. But I won't lie. As far as special ops go, this one's a bear, but I think we squeeze it Let's get it going.

MAJOR CALDWELL: If we can get to a lower altitude, we can use parachutes, but at this altitude, we'll pass out from Oxygen We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
MARSHALL: We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
MAJOR CALDWELL: We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane.
MARSHALL: They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
SECRETARY: The fax machines.
MARSHALL: Excuse me?
SECRETARY: The fax machines.
MARSHALL: ( dismissive ) No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
SECRETARY: No. I thought about this, Mr.

MARSHALL: White House Situation room.
MARSHALL: Someone should give you a raise.
SECRETARY: Actually, sir, you could be that
MARSHALL: It's yours.
ZEDECK: Still no movement on Stravanavitch.
ROSE: Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
KORSHUNOV: You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
MAJOR CALDWELL: These chutes are designed for a safe slow descent. They'll deploy off the line automatically as you step from the plane. You guys'll have to pull your own rip cords. Wait until you're clear from the plane, but not any longer. Once I check you, go stand behind the yellow line. You're good. You're good. You're good.
MAJOR CALDWELL: Mr. president? pwtsHALL The fax went through. We can only wait.

AIDE: Find out for yourself, sir. I'll have it waiting at the White House.
MAJOR CALDWELL: Here we go.
KORSHUNOV: What's that?
COL. CARLTON: Here they come.
GIBBS: She's bucking. I can't hold her!
LOOK OUT!: The broken edge of the fueling arm scrapes along the top of Air Force One. metal against metal. tearing a gash in the plane. Sparks fly.
GIBBS: Holy Shiti Gibbs pushes the stick down and Air Force One begins to dive to safety.
COL. CARLTON: Everybody break. Now! Now! Now!
ZEDECK: Don't move.
MAJOR CALDWELL: Let me save him.
ZEDECK: That man, he is the president, no?
SHEPHERD: Yes. Yes he is.
KORSHUNOV: Gibbs checks the guages.
GIBBS: More than enough to get us home.
V.P. CHANDLER: They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
GENERAL NORTHWOOD: Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
ALICE: ( to Korshunov ) He didn't leave us.
KORSHUNOV: You are a resilient man, Mr.
KORSHUNQV: You must forgive the tape, but we were starting to feel outnumbered.
MARSHALL: Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do Yes, Mr. President.
GIBBS: Yes, Mr. President.
MARSHALL: Because it is my duty.
GIBBS: Because it is my duty.
MARSHALL: You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
GIBBS: My loyalty was never to my country.
KORSHUNOV: You don't think the leaders of the KGB would allow peristroika to ruin years of infiltration? No, when the Soviet Union collapsed, we took our sleepers with us.
KORSHUNOV: Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
MARSHALL: Over my dead body.
KORSHUNOV: No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead.
KORSHUNOV: The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
ROSE: Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
MARSHALL: She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
KORSHUNOV: Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
MARSHALL: This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
KORSHUNOV: Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
KORSHUNOV: Perhaps a President does not negotiate, but does a father? An interesting choice. Your daughter versus your world vision. The implicit trust of a family against your oath of office.
ALICE: Alice. I.
MARSHALL: Alice. I.
KORSHUNOV: And once the trigger is pulled, she is gone forever. Then, I wonder, how do you live, knowing you could've saved her?
KORSHUNOV: And could you ever forget the look on her face as she ceases to exist. Late at night, when you think about her, will Stravanavitch really matter
ALICE: Daddy. Daddy, please.
ROSE: Jim. for godsake!
KORSHUNOV: Look inside your heart. No one will think you weak. Five.

KORSHUNOV: You'll do it?
MARSHALL: Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.
KORSHUNOV: Good. Good.
KORSHUNOV: Bring him the phone. Someday, you'll regret my nature.
MARSHALL: Someday, you'll regret my nature.
KORSHUNOV: You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness. You were a hostage to everyone else long before you were a hostage to
AIDE: Sir, the President of the United States wishes to speak with you.
PETROV: Mr. President.
GUARD: Stravanavitch awakes, and leans forward into the light. He and the guard trade looks. After a beat, the guard turns and retreats down the the hallway. Stravanavitch rises from his bunk and approaches the cell door. He leans against it and it swings open.
ROSE: Can my husband sit next to me?
ROSE: I don't know why you stayed.
MARSHALL: Please. don't start with me.
ROSE: There's something I need to tell you. and God knows if I'll ever get another chance.
ROSE: No matter what happens, you have been and always will be my hero.
MARSHALL: And you have always been my guardian

ROSE: You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
KORSHUNOV: You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
MARSHALL: Could I. Could I have some water?
KORSHUNOV: The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
MARSHALL: One thing I've learned as
KORSHUNOV: e Very poetic.
MARSHALL: And there's one thing I've learned from being a sports fan.
KORSHUNOV: And that is?
MARSHALL: It ain't over, til it's over.
MAJOR CALDWELL: Mr. President. Don't be hasty.
KORSHUNOV: Don't be hasty.
KORSHUNOV: You love your daughter, Mr.

PETROV: What is it?
AIDE: It's about Stravanvaitch.
PETROV: What about him?
AIDE: He's dead, sir. Shot while trying to
PETROV: So be it. The world will sleep easier.
COL. CARLTON: They've changed their bearing. Air Force One. Air Force One.
ROSE: Easy, Major. Easy.
MAJOR CALDWELL: The President?
ROSE: You saved his life.
MARSHALL: It's over, Korshunov. You won. Now let her go.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD: They aren't answering their hails.
DEAN: This doesn't make sense.
V.P. CHANDLER: How close are they?
LEE: The Iraqi Ambassador won't take our calls. We're trying to get through to their Central Command.
DEAN: To tell them what? The great infidel himself is flying overhead, Go get him? This is a man they burn in effigy If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD: Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
V.P. CHANDLER: If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
ALICE: Dad, look out. How you doing, sweetie?
MARSHALL: How you doing, sweetie?
ALICE: Been better, Dad. You?
COL. CARLTON: Air Force one. please respond. Air Force One, you are entering hostile air space. Air Force one.
KORSHUNOV: Stay where you are.
KORSHUNOV: There goes your ride.
MARSHALL: Let my daughter go or I'll take you If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
KORSHUNOV: If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
MARSHALL: Let her go now! Or I will kill you.
KORSHUNOV: No you won't. You'll compromise. like always.
MARSHALL: Hold on, Alice.
ALICE: Marshall dives down the sloping platform, reaching out for Alice tries to grip the platform with her hands, but she can't hold on. Her hand slip off the metallic lip. But as she falls, she's caught by the wrist. Strong arms pull her up. Her father's arms. He carries her back to the safety of the plane. She's sobs uncontrollably.

CERALLOS: Did we warn them off?
IRAQI SOLDIER: Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our
CERALLOS: It's some kind of trick. a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
IRAQI SOLDIER: They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
CERALLOS: The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
IRAQI SOLDIER: The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
CERALLOS: Warn then again. If they don't respond. shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
MARSHALL: What is that sound?
MARSHALL: My god. I think that was a MiG.
SHEPHERD: A MiG? Where the hell are we?
MARSHALL: They're flying a protection formation. Call D.C. Find out what's going on.
COL. CARLTON: I said back off and hold your fire.
COL. CARLTON: Halo Team, this is group leader.
COL. CARLTON: This is the real thing boys. Let's fly and fry.

COL. CARLTON: Who's flying the fucking plane?
MARSHALL: I'm doing what I can.
COL. CAELTON: Can you, can you change your heading to Zero Four One point six?

COL. CARLTON: Take the shot.
ALICE: Marshall checks display.
MARSHALL: Oh shit. It's got us.
YAAAAAAAAH!: An F-15 swoops up from below. Like a Secret Service agent during an assassination attempt. The F-15 takes the bullet in its mid-section. BOOM! The blast slams bits of the fighter plane against Air Force One. Rocking it badly. Chunks of the plane rip away metal sheeting on the 747's wings and tail section.
COL. CARLTON: We got six more bogeys, closing fast from the south.
COL. CARLTON: Roger that. Kick ass, Navy.
MARSHALL: Uh, we got a problem here.
