THE AMERICAN: Written by Rowan Joffe Martin Booth
INGRID: What are you looking for?
JACK: His anxiety is evident. INGRID laughs out loud.
INGRID: There are no wolves in the woods so close to the city.
INGRID: Beside the Snow-hare's prints are those of a man.
INGRID: A hunter?
INGRID: You have a gun.
INGRID: You have a gun! How do you have a gun? Why should you carry such a
INGRID: He stands up slowly and walks inland towards the corpse that is just visible now in the shadows beneath the trees. INGRID follows, frightened. The MAN is slouched forwards in a drift of snow, his body cushioned in white softness. JACK kicks the sole of his boot. He's dead.
INGRID: Jack talk to me!
INGRID: Who is he?
JACK: A hunter.
INGRID: He's not dressed like a hunter. Why is he alone? Hunters always go in pairs. For safety.
JACK: Go for help. Call the police.
JACK: Blending in?
LARRY: Jack. What brings you to Rome?
JACK: I closed the Stockholm account.
JACK: But there were complications.
JACK: Collateral damage. Two shooters. Unidentified. [A beat] And a girl.
LARRY: There's a bar across the street: the L'Aquila. Freshen up. Sit tight. Give me two hours.
LARRY: ( genuinely shocked ) You started smoking again?
JACK: Guess so.
LARRY: Since when?
JACK: Since now.
WAITER: The WAITER disappears. A beat. LARRY puts an ENVELOPE on the table.
LARRY: The WAITER disappears. A beat. LARRY puts an ENVELOPE on the table.
LARRY: Stockholm account. Final
LARRY: You can't stay here, Jack. You won't see `em coming, not in a big city. But you can't go far, either. If the gentlemen whose accounts you closed belonged to Brink, Gallazzo, Simenov- any of the first division- you have four or five hours at most before every airport, train station, bus stop, toll booth and ski lift from Stockholm to Skopje is under surveillance.
JACK: Not a question. An acknowledgement that LARRY knows exactly what he's talking about. And JACK is listening.
LARRY: So. You find a hole- somewhere nearby- and you crawl into it and you stay put until I say it's safe to come out.
LARRY: Turn right outside the bar then second left. Via Spinetti. You'll find a silver Citroen C2 with Chieti plates. Check the glove box and follow the map. Castelvecchio. It's a fucking fortress. Literally. And as dead as a graveyard. Anyone within a three to five mile radius you'll see `em coming.
LARRY: Get there. Stay there.
LARRY: Do nothing `till you get my call.
BANG!: JACK drops to his knees.
BANG!: The DUCATI backfires for a second time. A pause. Still on his knees, JACK pretends to tie his right shoe lace. The MAN ON THE DUCATI stops outside an apartment further up the alleyway, gets off his rickety motorbike and removes his helmet. He's a corpulent, ruddy faced Italian man in his late He glances at JACK. JACK stands.
JACK: Buon giorno.
JACK: MAN ON DUCATI
JACK: Si. Il Americano. L'Americano ! L'Americano!
JACK: I'm no good with machines.
FATHER BENEDETTO: You are American. You speak Italian?
JACK: FATHER BENEDETTO
FATHER BENEDETTO: You speak Italian?
JACK: FATHER BENEDETTO
FATHER BENEDETTO: Va bene! You stay at Pensione
JACK: Not for much longer.
FATHER BENEDETTO: On vacation?
JACK: Working vacation.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Lavoro? Che genere de lavoro?
JACK: FATHER BENEDETTO
FATHER BENEDETTO: Va bene. Che genere de fotografia?
JACK: Pictures of the region. Architecture, landscapes.
FATHER BENEDETTO: He stands straight and smiles winningly.
JACK: No people. Sights and landmarks. For guidebooks, magazines.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Ah! Magazine! Which magazine?
JACK: Actually it's a syndicate. Lots of different publications. Um. Casa Va bene. So you must share a glass of wine with me. Questa sera. This
FATHER BENEDETTO: Va bene. So you must share a glass of wine with me. Questa sera. This
JACK: You're very kind, but I.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Certo. You want to know the truth about Abruzzo? A priest sees
JACK: Did I forget to mention my electromagnetic hypersensitivity?
JACK: Who's the client?
JACK: This is a small town, Larry. I don't like small towns. I grew up in one. Besides, I'm already attracting attention.
JACK: I'll think about it.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Que siamo! The quality of the brandy is good, the liquor is smooth and the glass warmed by the
FATHER BENEDETTO: ( in ENGLISH ) The only good thing to come from the Francesi, everything else.
FATHER BENEDETTO: The French are. pezzi di merda. This is not an American discovery. Italians have known this for centuries. [In ITALIAN] When Rome called France the province of Gaul, they were just the same. Arrogant sensualists. Their cuisine is fussy and their wine effeminate. Only their brandy is worthy of any
FATHER BENEDETTO: ( in ENGLISH ) Forgive me. I speak too fast. You study our history?
JACK: FATHER BENEDETTO looks horrified.
FATHER BENEDETTO: You come to Italy to make a guide book and you don't care about I take pictures, father.
JACK: I take pictures, father.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Of course. You are American. You think you can escape history. You live for the present.
JACK: I try to, father.
JACK: Un po' di formaggio, per favore.
OLD WOMAN: Quale? Pecorino, parmigiano?
JACK: He points.
JACK: E un po' di pecorino.
WOMAN: Prego. You're welcome.
JACK: Prego. You're welcome.
WOMAN: You're American.
JACK: "Amidst gathering clouds".
WOMAN: You're assuming I'm English or you'd never have mentioned the weather. In fact I'm Belgian but I went to boarding school in England. And am quite happy to converse on all subjects meteorological. Buon giorno. Desidera?
WAITER: Buon giorno. Desidera?
WOMAN: Una spremute di limone. Per favore.
WAITER: The WOMAN looks at JACK for the first time, studying him, awaiting his answer as if a great deal depended on it.
JACK: Una gelata alla fragola. Per
JACK: The identification process over, there is nothing more to do but get down to business- and conversation becomes suddenly She trails off.

MATHILDE: It's hot. My car has no air conditioning. I asked for it,
JACK: What car did they give you?
JACK: She takes a long time to answer. When she does, she does so over the rim of her half-empty coffee cup, scanning the crowd like a cheating wife customarily anxious not to be seen by her husband.
MATHILDE: One fifty to one seven five meters.
JACK: Five seconds. Seven at the most.
MATHILDE: Five seconds. Seven at the most.
JACK: Fire rate?
MATHILDE: Fire rate?
JACK: Fire rate?
MATHILDE: Magazine capacity?
JACK: Magazine capacity?
MATHILDE: Large. Preferably 9mm Parabellum. The weapon must be fairly light. And compact. Possible to be broken down into its constituent parts.
MATHILDE: The weapon must be fairly light. And compact. Possible to be broken down into its constituent parts.
L'AMERICANO: How compact?
MATHILDE: As compact as possible.
JACK: You want a submachine gun to fit in a lady's purse?
MATHILDE: A small vanity case would be A small briefcase would be
JACK: A small briefcase would be
JACK: X-rays? Camouflage: lap-top, DVD player, MP3 or digital camera?
MATHILDE: Not necessary.
JACK: No such thing. You'll have to make do with a suppressor like everyone else. It'll dampen the decibels, dislocate the sound source and reduce muzzle flash. I can't make you silent but I can make you invisible as the Finnish phrase goes, but only as long as you're prepared to lose some range.

MATHILDE: Excuse me?
JACK: By the clothes stall. Light blue shirt, open at the neck, expensive buff suede shoes. Is he with you?
MATHILDE: I didn't see him. In any case, I'm
MATHILDE: I can accept a slight loss of
JACK: You want a weapon with the firing capacity of a submachine gun and the range of a rifle.
MATHILDE: Can you do it?
JACK: Give me a month. To trial. Then a week for final adjustments.
THUD!: As the BOOK hits the floor JACK opens his eyes, sits up and rips the taped WALTHER from beneath the bed, pointing it at the door. JACK's heart is beating.
JACK: Buon giorno.
JACK: Il fermo posta?
POSTMASTER: A beat.
JACK: Deftly, like a teller counting through a thick wad of banknotes he flicks through the mail with thin, wasted
POSTMASTER: Clarke. Una pacchetto.
JACK: Clarke. Una pacchetto.
POSTMASTER: This makes all the difference. The POSTMASTER clicks again, disappearing behind the rack of pigeon holes.
POSTMASTER: Clarky, Clarky, Clarky. Ecco.
JACK: JACK flicks his eyes downwards. He has already put his PASSPORT on the counter. The POSTMASTER scoops it up with bony fingers. Looks from the picture to JACK. JACK bears the scrutiny with a deadly straight face.

ITALIAN GIRL: She reaches up to touch JACK as we cut to:
JACK: Your source in Rome.
JACK: I hope you paid below the odds. The more you pay them the more cops gossip in the locker room.
JACK: 50 EXT. TOWN SQUARE- DAY 50 51 INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S KITCHEN- EVENING 51
FATHER BENEDETTO: All the sheep in my flock are dear to me, but some are dearer than most. Especially those that have strayed from the fold.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Fabio. He is a. [in ITALIAN] 'car doctor'. But I suspect his practice is not entirely sound. Ecco!
FATHER BENEDETTO: Fagiano. Pheasant. With sauce of orange juice, orange peel, chestnuts, garlic, Marsala wine and. Come si dici in Inglese? Brodo di Pollo. Chicken broth.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Also: salsify in garlic butter. Mange-tout. Fried wild mushrooms with truffle.
JACK: FATHER BENEDETTO shrugs.
FATHER BENEDETTO: The Holy Father eats better than

FATHER BENEDETTO: Have you ever wanted to be anything other than a. come se dice in I do what I'm good at.
JACK: FATHER BENEDETTO
FATHER BENEDETTO: I do what I'm good at.
JACK: I do what I'm good at.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I'm sure you have other talents. You have the hands of a craftsman, not an artist. You are good with machines. Yet you told me just the opposite when we first met.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Journalism cannot make you a rich FATHER BENEDETTO's eyes flick over the ROLEX.
JACK: FATHER BENEDETTO
FATHER BENEDETTO: Perhaps you are rich already?
JACK: I'm not a young man. I have my My meagre income is subject to the vagaries of the stock market and with church attendance declining there's less and less money in the offertory. But if a man has God in his vaults.
FATHER BENEDETTO: ( in ITALIAN ) My meagre income is subject to the vagaries of the stock market and with church attendance declining there's less and less money in the offertory. But if a man has God in his vaults.
JACK: I don't think God is interested in me. Father.
FATHER BENEDETTO: ( in ENGLISH ) I know better than to try to make a convert over pheasant and
JACK: What are the snakes for, father?
FATHER BENEDETTO: "The grave soul keeps its own secrets, and takes its own punishment in silence."
JACK: Sono un amico di Padre Benedetto.
FABIO: JACK smiles politely.
JACK: Buon giorno.
JACK: I'm taking pictures forty minutes north of here. Right up in the mountains. Father Benedetto said you might be able to help.
FABIO: ( in ITALIAN ) You need models. For your photographs? Italian girls?
JACK: My publisher wouldn't stretch to a four by four and the park trails are playing havoc with my chassis.
FABIO: ( in ITALIAN ) Want me to take a look?
JACK: Not really. I just need something to work on a ruptured driveshaft.
FABIO: ( in ITALIAN ) You're a mechanic?
JACK: Just a hobby. I tinker.
FABIO: ( in ITALIAN ) Help yourself. [In ENGLISH] My garage is your garage.
JACK: I appreciate that.
JACK: FABIO is engrossed his work.
FABIO: Si! Si! Va bene!
JACK: FABIO grins and growls. A gearwheel with no bite is useless to him.
FABIO: JACK wraps the gearwheel in a sheet of oily newspaper and puts it in the sports bag with the tools. At the door, he pauses. That's when JACK sees it on the notice board. A PHOTOGRAPH of FATHER BENEDETTO and FABIO. FABIO is much younger in this photo: fourteen or fifteen years old. He's wearing an AS Roma football strip. Again: the priest has his arm around the boy.
JACK: Ciao. Grazie.
FABIO: Ciao, Americano!
CHOOP!: Not the conventional "phut, phut, phut" of a movie silencer, but the genuine dampened sonic boom of a TAC 65 sound Through the sight we see the water churn at four o'clock to the REED CLUMP and four metres off. From the knapsack, JACK takes a watchmaker's steel-handled screwdriver and adjusts the sight, then loads another ten rounds in the magazine.

JACK: E Clara qui? [Is Clara here?]
SECOND GIRL: Non e stasera qui. [She's not here tonight.]
SECOND GIRL: Volete una bevanda? [Would you like a drink?]
JACK: Forse un altro tempo. [Perhaps another time.]
JACK: I've got company.
JACK: If he's not baby-sitting the Belgian contract then he's either a Joe, a cop or a shooter. He's not with The Company, they're fast: it's been three days and no TA. He's not intel: they're deep background and he wants to be noticed. He might be a cowboy but he can't be a cop: they work in pairs and he's alone. Strike Guarda di Finanza, State Police and NOCS: he's not Italian- he doesn't look like one, dress like one or behave like one. So who the hell is he?
JACK: LARRY ( V.O. )
JACK: What's he waiting for?
JACK: I can handle it.
JACK: It's a bad line.
JACK: LARRY ( V.O. )
MATHILDE: Mr. Clarke. How good to see you
MATHILDE: The Carabinieri around here like roadblocks. It's cover.
JACK: The Carabinieri around here like roadblocks. It's cover.
MATHILDE: You picked a beautiful spot.
MATHILDE: You would be hard pressed to make a fast get away in this.
MATHILDE: I would have thought you to have had at least an Alfa Romeo.
JACK: This attracts less attention.
MATHILDE: Is it far?
JACK: Fifty minutes. Up there?
MATHILDE: Up there?
MATHILDE: The train was tiring. One has to keep alert so much in cities.
JACK: I'll wake you before the turn-off.
MATHILDE: Are we nearly there?
JACK: The turn-off's up ahead.
MATHILDE: I told you I work alone.
JACK: Just a precaution.
MATHILDE: Are those houses occupied?
JACK: Derelict. I checked three days ago.
MATHILDE: We should check again.
JACK: I'll check alone. There are adders the mountains. And vipers. Your I'll be careful.
MATHILDE: I'll be careful.
MATHILDE: You have tested the gun here
JACK: Satisfied that he's alone, he lowers his binoculars. MATHILDE takes a deep breath of mountain air.
MATHILDE: It's beautiful here.
MATHILDE: I wish everywhere could be this
JACK: You'd be out of a job.
MATHILDE: You don't like the peace?
JACK: It's hard to like something you know nothing about.
MATHILDE: I've made up two sorts.
JACK: I've made up two sorts.
JACK: Thirty lead and thirty jacketed.
MATHILDE: I should like a hundred of each.
MATHILDE: And fifty explosive.
JACK: Not a problem.
JACK: Will mercury do?
MATHILDE: Mercury will do very nicely.
MATHILDE: I have made my own targets.
JACK: Watch out for vipers.
MATHILDE: Muzzle velocity?
JACK: At least three hundred and sixty miles per hour. That's including twenty off the top for the sound
MATHILDE: I've not had one before.
JACK: I've not had one before.
MATHILDE: I've not had one before.
JACK: You'll find it easy. I've re- balanced it for the longer barrel. The fulcrum is two centimetres forward of the grip now. Which won't matter if you're firing- and I'm guessing you are- from a fixed
JACK: No major recoil issues. You should be able to hold onto any target. Even the smallest.
CHOOP! CHOOP!: For a moment longer she holds on the target then lowers the gun, holding it under her arm like a lady on a shire hunt would hold a 12 bore.
MATHILDE: You've done a good job, Mr. Clarke. Thank you. Thank you very much.
JACK: Good shot.
MATHILDE: Go to the stones and fire near me.
MATHILDE: She looks round for a target.
MATHILDE: .into the bush with the yellow flowers. Two bursts. Five seconds
CHOOP! CHOOP!: MATHILDE remains untouched. So do the YELLOW FLOWERS. Troubled, JACK blinks rapidly and counts to five. Then he fires again.
MATHILDE: The sound suppression is superb. I couldn't place the direction of
MATHILDE: I shall require the rounds and the weapon by the first of next month. In the meantime would you tighten the adjusting screws on the sight, they are too loose. And lengthen the stock by three centimetres. I also want a sixty round magazine.
JACK: You'll upset the balance.
MATHILDE: I'm prepared to accept that.
JACK: Then I'm happy to oblige.
MATHILDE: What about the a case?
JACK: A briefcase. Samsonite. Standard pattern in black with combination locks. Is there a number you'd
MATHILDE: MATHILDE hands him the ENVELOPE and disassembles the weapon. JACK wraps the SOCIMI parts up in their cloth squares and places them in the bottom of the PICNIC HAMPER.

MATHILDE: What do you want done with these?
JACK: Throw them in the lake.
MATHILDE: How thoughtful.
MATHILDE: I don't know Italian wine.
JACK: Aspirinio. Like Mosacata but
JACK: It wouldn't look right if the picnic wasn't touched.
MATHILDE: You chilled the wine. I thought.
JACK: It had to be chilled. They're Italian cops.
MATHILDE: ( disappointed ) You think of everything.
JACK: I'm paid to. Don't move.
MATHILDE: They both stare at the insect, transfixed.
MATHILDE: It's so beautiful.
JACK: Parnassius apollo. It's endangered.
MATHILDE: You like coming here.
JACK: It serves its purpose.
MATHILDE: You've never taken a woman here
JACK: The BUTTERFLY flits away.
MATHILDE: ( sadly ) Perhaps you do not have a woman in your life. It is not easy for us to keep relationships. Not in our I have an acquaintance.
JACK: I have an acquaintance.
MATHILDE: Friendships are transitory. It Wild boar.
JACK: Wild boar.
MATHILDE: I wish you hadn't brought me here.
MATHILDE: This is the sort of place I wish I'd discovered by myself. Then maybe one day I could have retired here. But you already know it.
JACK: I'm much older than you. By the time you've retired I'll be dead.
MATHILDE: We will meet as before? On the first of next month?
MATHILDE: On the first of next month?
MATHILDE: Around noon?
MATHILDE: Thank you for a lovely day. Mr.
MATHILDE: You must take your mistress to the meadow for a picnic.
BARMAN: Sergio Leone. Italiano.
BARMAN: ( in poor ENGLISH ) You like cow boy movie?
JACK: 84 INT. BROTHEL, VIA LAMPEDUSA- NIGHT 84
CLARA: She looks at him.
CLARA: ( with certainty ) Morboso is like. when you can't stop thinking about something.
JACK: Morboso is like. when you can't stop thinking about something.
CLARA: Morboso is like. when you can't stop thinking about something.
CLARA: Or someone.
JACK: You needn't act.
CLARA: CLARA watches him, confused but fascinated.
JACK: You might have to act with your other clients but you don't have to pretend anything at all with me.
JACK: I want you to be yourself with me. Be as indifferent as you like. I came here to get pleasure, not to give it.
CLARA: Maybe I pretend very well. I got more tip than the other girls usually get. I don't sleep with the other girls.
JACK: I don't sleep with the other girls.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I've been looking for you.
FATHER BENEDETTO: A man was here asking questions about you.
JACK: FATHER BENEDETTO
FATHER BENEDETTO: He came to the church this What did he want?
JACK: What did he want?
FATHER BENEDETTO: To know where you live. He said he was a friend from Switzerland.
JACK: JACK thinks.
JACK: And you told him?
FATHER BENEDETTO: Of course I do not tell him. How do I know him? He is maybe the police. Certainly he is no friend. A friend would know your pensione.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Friends do not carry guns.
FATHER BENEDETTO: If you live in Italy, and you are a man of the cloth, you meet many people. Besides, I lived once in Naples. If you live in Naples you know the difference between a fat wallet and a. custodia per armi di spalla. How you say in English?
JACK: Shoulder holster.
FATHER BENEDETTO: JACK glances up and down the aisle. OLD LADIES are dribbling into church in twos and threes. The BELL for mass starts ringing.
JACK: You're a true friend, father.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I am a priest.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Signor Clarke?
FATHER BENEDETTO: I make a mistake. He did not say he was from La Svizzera: Switzerland. He said- forgive me the names in Italian are so similar- La Svezia:
BARMAN: ( in ITALIAN ) Someone left this for "L'Americano". This afternoon.
JACK: He turns casually away from the BARMAN's prying eyes and opens the envelope with extreme caution. Inside is a folded CUTTING. It's from the Swedish Daily newspaper ÖSTERSUNDS-POSTEN. JACK unfolds the cutting. We catch a glimpse of: -Ingrid's dacha. -A police line. -Three dead bodies in the snow: the two hitmen and the girl. Heart racing, JACK slips the cutting in his pocket. Grabs three SUGAR CUBES from a silver bowl on the bar. And leaves.
BANG!: The DUCATI misfires. Mistaking the sound for gunfire, the YOUNG MAN drops, rolls and fires back. We hear the sound of a single suppressed shot: CHOOP!
CHOOP!: A bullet hits the road not far from JACK.
CHOOP!: Another bullet hits the wall behind him. Swiftly, JACK grabs hold of the battered 1970s DUCATI.
CLARA: Buon giorno!
JACK: Buon giorno.
CLARA: You are hurt?
JACK: I'm fine.
CLARA: What's wrong with you?
JACK: It's nothing really. Just a broken rib. Un costollo rotta?
CLARA: Stronzo! Let me help you!
JACK: I came off my bike.
CLARA: But you have to go to the hospital!
JACK: No, no, no. I have pain killers. I just need a strong cup of coffee.
CLARA: I know a place which make the strongest coffee in L'Aquila.
CLARA: Ve bene. Tutto posto. Signor Farfalla. [Good. Everything's OK. Mr. Butterfly.]
JACK: Why d'you call me that?
CLARA: You have a tattoo. On your back.
JACK: How did he know I was here, Larry?
JACK: I doubt it.
WHAM!: Something smacks into the phone box at high speed.
CLARA: My friend Anna. This is my friend Signor Farfalla.
JACK: How do you do?
ANNA: I am very well thank you.
JACK: Will you take a coffee with me?
CLARA: That would be very good.
JACK: CLARA moves her chair to sit closer to JACK. Under the table, her knee presses against his. ANNA also moves her chair nearer to JACK: but her motive is to move it out of the sun. She is not flirting.
CLARA: Anna is learning English.
JACK: Have you been to England?
ANNA: But you are.
ANNA: Lui Americano?
JACK: I am.
ANNA: Ah. I have not been to England only to France. But I would love to go to America.
JACK: Due cappuccini e un cafe corretto.
CLARA: Anna is like all Italians. She thinks America is like in the movies. Little Italy, "West Side Story", "Chicago".
JACK: If not with gold, than at least not with enough medieval cobbles to loosen every-self tapping screw in a Fiat.
JACK: Where do you come from, Anna?
JACK: Dove abita?
ANNA: Ah, yes! I live in Via dell' Argilla. Nearby to Clara.
CLARA: Perhaps we will have a drink together soon? I am free.
CLARA: .on Monday.
JACK: Great. I'll see you then.
CLARA: But Eduardo. Where would you like to meet?
JACK: How about our usual place?
CLARA: Our usual place?
CLARA: I forgot. Where is our usual place?
JACK: You've forgotten?
CLARA: Remind me.
JACK: Maybe we should try something Where would you like to try, Locanda Grapelli?
CLARA: Where would you like to try, Locanda Grapelli?
JACK: Locanda Grapelli?
CLARA: Locanda Grapelli! Si!
ANNA: This is the best food in the area.
JACK: Locanda Grapelli.
CLARA: Locanda Grapelli.
JACK: Locanda Grapelli.
CLARA: Locanda Grapelli.
JACK: Locanda Grapelli.
CLARA: You'll be there?
JACK: I'll be there.
CLARA: See you then, Eduardo.
JACK: See you then, Clara. It was a delight to meet you Anna. Arrivederci, Signor Farfalla.
ANNA: Arrivederci, Signor Farfalla.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Buon giorno!
FATHER BENEDETTO: I walk here to meditate. Once a week, Wednesday, the farthest one can travel in the week from the Sabbath. The trees are like the Stations of the Cross: by certain trees I thank God for certain favours he has granted me, or certain gifts he has made to me and all men. For example, here by this pine, I thank him for the many friendships I have and ask him to look after those of my friends who are troubled.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Some walk here in the cool of evening. Others come at night.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I wonder how many bastards have been made here?
FATHER BENEDETTO: Perhaps you'll stay and settle here What makes you think I'm leaving?
JACK: What makes you think I'm leaving?
FATHER BENEDETTO: You told me as much when we first met. Besides, those who seek for peace seldom find it. They're always moving on, looking elsewhere. [A BEAT] And they are usually sinners.
JACK: All men are sinners.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Some are greater sinners than others. And those who seek peace have much sinning in their history.
JACK: I don't seek peace. I never have.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Until now.
JACK: Perhaps. Perhaps I'll stay. The valley. The villages. The Forgive me. This is the priest in me speaking. And the friend. But you have done much sinning, Signor Clarke. You still do.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Forgive me. This is the priest in me speaking. And the friend. But you have done much sinning, Signor Clarke. You still do.
JACK: I see a whore. She's young enough to be my daughter.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I do not refer to the sins of carnality. But to the deadly Aren't all sins equal?
JACK: Aren't all sins equal?
FATHER BENEDETTO: We are not discussing theology, my friend, but you. You like this town, this valley.
FATHER BENEDETTO: You want to speak but you dare not. You know no one sufficiently well to share your history with them. You know I am trustworthy yet still you are cautious. What job do you do, Signor? Are you on the run, as they say?
FATHER BENEDETTO: What job do you do, Signor? Are you on the run, as they say?
JACK: Who says?
FATHER BENEDETTO: It's an expression, no?
JACK: Everyone's on the run from Some men watch some of the shadows. You watch them all.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Some men watch some of the shadows. You watch them all.
JACK: I've done nothing I didn't have good cause to do.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Do you wish to tell me?
JACK: For what reason?
FATHER BENEDETTO: For your own sake. Perhaps I can pray for you?
JACK: I make things. Artifacts.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Counterfeit money?
JACK: Why do you say that?
FATHER BENEDETTO: You work in metal. You are given some steel by Fabio, the car You know a lot about me.
JACK: You know a lot about me.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I know only what you do in the town. People talk to me. I am their priest and they trust me.
JACK: And I should too?
FATHER BENEDETTO: Of course.
JACK: Fabio. The `car doctor'. Was he conceived here father?
FATHER BENEDETTO: Why do you ask me that?
JACK: He looks like you. Even more than he does in the photos you keep of each other. Where was he conceived, father? Under one of these trees? At night? Like all the other
FATHER BENEDETTO: I do not remember, Signor. It was twenty-five years ago.
FATHER BENEDETTO: In the end it is I who confesses to Expecting me to reciprocate?
JACK: Expecting me to reciprocate?
FATHER BENEDETTO: Perhaps. For your own good. You cannot doubt the existence of Hell. You live in it. It is a place without love. As for me, I go about my daily duties because the town requires it of me. Some know what you know. Perhaps I have no right to wear these robes. But I do have a heart full of a father's love. Something close to His heart! And for that I am both grateful and
FATHER BENEDETTO: What do you have, my friend?
CLARA: I did not think you would come.
JACK: I wasn't sure you meant me to.
CLARA: A WAITER approaches.
WAITER: Per due?
CLARA: 120 EXT. LOCANDA GRAPPELLI- NIGHT 120
CLARA: Una botiglia di acqua minerale non gasata et. una Parasini, per Menu in Inglese?
WAITER: Menu in Inglese?
JACK: No, grazie.
WAITER: Tedesco? Olandese?
CLARA: ( to the WAITER ) He speaks Italian. So do I. Listen:
CLARA: Una botiglia di acqua minerale et una Parasini, per favore. Non gasata.
WAITER: Non gasata.
CLARA: Non gasata.
CLARA: ( mostly to herself ) Small towns.
JACK: Small towns.
CLARA: Parasini. From Calabria. It is good, you will agree?
JACK: It is. Very good.
CLARA: Can I ask you something, Eduardo?
JACK: You are married?
CLARA: You are married?
JACK: A beat.
JACK: I doubt any of the couples here are. With the exception of the Germans at table seven. She's wearing a wedding ring and they haven't spoken a word to each other for eight and half minutes.
CLARA: I was sure this was your secret.
JACK: What makes you think I have a secret? I'm an ordinary man. I cough. I fart. I earn a living.
CLARA: I do not think you are an ordinary man. I think you are a good man. But you have a secret. He thinks we are a couple.
CLARA: He thinks we are a couple.
JACK: Why spoil the illusion?
CLARA: ( in ITALIAN ) As long as we know it is an
WAITER: Buona sera. Desidera? JACK and CLARA are walking. He has a cigarette in his mouth. They look like film stars. CLARA slips her arm through his. They say nothing. The pedestrian shopping street is thronging with other couples.
CLARA: She eats, savoring the ice cream. JACK watches, savoring her
JACK: How is it?
CLARA: ( amused ) It's- come se dice- `slang', no?
JACK: ( amused ) It's- come se dice- `slang', no?
CLARA: It's- come se dice- `slang', no?
JACK: No thanks.
CLARA: Come on, Eduardo!
CLARA: It is good, you will agree?
JACK: ( his mouth full ) I will agree.
CLARA: ( sensing his teasing ) My English is nice!
JACK: It's bitchin'.
CLARA: ( defending herself ) You know how to swear in Italian?
JACK: Sure. Bastardo. Imbecile.
CLARA: "Imbecile?" Eduardo! Try: Mangia merde e morte: tuo cazzo un Eat shit and die, pimple dick?
JACK: Eat shit and die, pimple dick?
CLARA: I guess I've led a sheltered life. Of sorts.
JACK: I guess I've led a sheltered life. Of sorts.
CLARA: Too much work.
JACK: Too much work.
CLARA: Too much work.
CLARA: I don't apologise, Eduardo.
JACK: For what?
CLARA: For this I do. My job.
JACK: Never apologise.
CLARA: Except this job is full of testa di Mine too.
JACK: Mine too.
CLARA: But you are too young to. Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client?
JACK: But you are too young to. Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client?
CLARA: But you are too young to. Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client?
JACK: Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client?
CLARA: Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client?
JACK: Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client?
CLARA: Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client?
JACK: Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client?
JACK: Am I a client?
CLARA: This say yes.
CLARA: She points at her heart.
CLARA: This cannot be for sale. But I am not want to. come se dice?
JACK: Give it away.
CLARA: Stronzo! I buy you a present!
JACK: An embarrassed beat. CLARA kisses him.
JACK: Grazie, Clara.
CLARA: Prego. Eduardo.
CLARA: My apartment is not far from here.
JACK: LARRY ( V.O. )
JACK: I don't deliver, Larry. I never deliver. It's too dangerous. She comes to me. I know the town. That's what we agreed.
JACK: Breach? What breach?
LARRY: Our pretty young Belgian client and her associates think someone on your long list of enemies might have put a tail on you.
LARRY: Course not, Jack. But if, for the sake of argument, it was possible- I'm thinking it could be Galazzo. Or Simenov. Or Italian undercover.
LARRY: The crooked kind.
LARRY: The Belgians think they're planning to wait for the drop and exterminate you and Mathilde in one
LARRY: I'm fucked if I know, Jack. If you want my opinion, they're just being jittery. I told `em you were the most security conscious professional I know. I told `em no one gets close to you.
JACK: They don't.
JACK: They can. They can trust me and so can you.
JACK: I've never jeopardised an operation in my life.
LARRY: Jack? [A BEAT] Jack? I'm sorry.
LARRY: That was, um.. I'm just saying you can be relied on.
LARRY: 128 EXT. PAY PHONE- DAY 128
CLARA: Ciao, Eduardo!
JACK: Put them in the back. We've got a way to go.
CLARA: Where we go?
JACK: How far do we go? To Fanale?
CLARA: How far do we go? To Fanale?
JACK: An hour. And we're not going to the sea, we're going to the lakes. In the mountains.
CLARA: For a. come se dice. you have in the back.
JACK: A picnic.
CLARA: A pick-nick! We are going for a pick-nick. Just the two of us.
CLARA: I have practise my English, Eduardo. I love to have pick-nick. It is a beautiful day, isn't it?
JACK: It is.
CLARA: Is it more far?
JACK: Ten kilometres. Another twenty
CLARA: Twelve kilometres? In twenty We're going off the beaten track.
JACK: We're going off the beaten track.
JACK: Lontano. Fuori mano.
CLARA: You will speak Italian. One day, I will teach you.
CLARA: Where are we going?
JACK: You shall see.
CLARA: I think it is good we should stay close to the road.
JACK: There's no need to worry. I've been here before several times. Taking
JACK: You're not afraid of coming into the wild with me, are you?
CLARA: She laughs tensely.
CLARA: Of course I am not. Not with you. But this.
CLARA: She waves her hand in the air.
CLARA: You should have a jeep. A Toyota. It is not good for a. berlina. This is a Citroen!
JACK: This is a Citroen!
JACK: This was made by the French for taking potatoes to market. Besides, I always come here in this car.
CLARA: You sure?
JACK: Of course. I don't want to walk back to town any more than you do.
CLARA: I think you are crazy. This will go to nowhere.
JACK: I assure you it does.
CLARA: Now there is no road!
CLARA: Is this where we go?
JACK: No. Not quite. We go another hundred metres, through the wood. But from here we just roll forward. No motor. No sound. And you'll see a wonder.
JACK: You won't need to hold on. I'll go slowly. Just relax and look.
CLARA: No one comes here?
JACK: Just you.
CLARA: Just you.
JACK: CLARA turns away, unbuttons her blouse and drops it on the grass. She is wearing no bra. On her back dapple the shadows and patches of sun eking through the branches of the walnut. She kicks off her shoes, which curve through the air. and unzips her skirt. It falls to the grass. She bends and steps daintily from her knickers. Then turns to face JACK. JACK cannot take his eyes off her. Dizzy, he steps forward without meaning to.
CLARA: She is coquettish- and tosses her auburn hair to one side.
CLARA: I am going to swim in the lake. Are you coming?
JACK: There are vipers! Vipera! Marasso!
CLARA: Maybe! But I am lucky! He is an Italian bird! We disturb his siesta!
CLARA: ( shouting ) He is an Italian bird! We disturb his siesta!
CLARA: Come, Signor Farfalla!
CLARA: JACK turns to face the lake. He is naked. Yet with the caution of years he does not remove his shoes until he reaches the water's edge.
CLARA: Stand by me. Keep still. Watch.
CLARA: Keep still. Watch.
JACK: If we stay here for a year, they'll devour us.
CLARA: It is said that if these fishes bite at two hands holding, then love is good for the people.
JACK: Maybe we should.
CLARA: Do you make love in the water?
JACK: I haven't.
CLARA: What's wrong? Let's eat.
JACK: Let's eat.
CLARA: JACK looks at her.
CLARA: Is this your real name?
JACK: Is Clara yours?
CLARA: Si. Yes.
JACK: Edward is my real name.
CLARA: She doesn't believe him.
CLARA: You are sure you are not married, Quite sure.
JACK: Quite sure.
CLARA: Will you put this on my back?
CLARA: He's frozen.
CLARA: Time seems to stop. ECU on JACK. Suddenly, CLARA sits up.
CLARA: Eduardo, what's wrong?
JACK: When he moves towards her, he is holding nothing in his
SLAM!: JACK shuts the boot of the car. He scans the lakeside. No sign of the picnic. No sign of CLARA.
CLARA: Grazie, Eduardo.
JACK: I still don't understand. What's the point of a gun if it's not One of the girls borrow it to me after the second hooker in Chieti is murdered. With some of the clients it make me feel safe. I don't tell the police, of course, but. Madonna, Eduardo. How they do to these two women! A police agente from Rome show me photographs. They show photographs to everyone in Via Lampedusa.

CLARA: Non capito. how one person hurt another in this way.
JACK: Does the gun make you feel safer with me?
CLARA: You are not a client.
JACK: Then why's it in your purse?
CLARA: I have to work tonight, amore.
CLARA: What will you do?
JACK: I guess I'll go to work too.
CLARA: And after that? Tomorrow and the next day.
JACK: I can't stay here forever. It's not that I've given up on life, Father. Just the way that I was living it. If you can call it I want always to stay here.
CLARA: I want always to stay here.
JACK: It's time to go home.
CLARA: Let me come to your home.
JACK: I can't, Clara. One day.
CLARA: Stay forever here.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Ciao Fabio, come stai?
IL POSTINO: Bene grazie, Padre.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Dear Father Benedetto. I promised myself that I would write to you- as your friend- to say goodbye.
MATHILDE: Hello. I see you have brought it in from the car with you.
JACK: All there, as agreed.
MATHILDE: What's in the paper bag?
JACK: Sweets. For your journey.
JACK: I guessed you'd have a sweet tooth.
MATHILDE: That is most thoughtful of you. I suppose I'll read about this in the Times or the International Herald Tribune. Or Il Maessagiero.
JACK: I suppose I'll read about this in the Times or the International Herald Tribune. Or Il Maessagiero.
MATHILDE: Yes, I expect so.
MATHILDE: I'm just going to the ladies. Wait
MATHILDE: Shall we go.
MATHILDE: You won't need your piece.
JACK: You never know.
MATHILDE: Sure. You?
OK?: Sure. You?
JACK: Sure. You?
MATHILDE: Everything's just fine.
MATHILDE: Final payment.
MATHILDE: Buy yourself a retirement clock.
JACK: How do you know I'm retiring?
MATHILDE: Have you taken your girl up to the meadow yet? MATHILDE looks both irritated and relieved.
MATHILDE: ( whispers to JACK ) Do it.
MATHILDE: Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly.
JACK: 150 EXT. AUTOSTRADA, CAFE- DAY 150
CLARA!: 150 EXT. AUTOSTRADA, CAFE- DAY 150
LARRY: Not only did you not kill him, you gave him my fucking money?
MATHILDE: What else could I do? There were kids everywhere. Besides he's He's paranoid. That's why I'm paying you the GDP of a small country to get close to him. You could have got him in the sack. You should have got him in the car park. Now you're going to have to take him out long range!
LARRY: He's paranoid. That's why I'm paying you the GDP of a small country to get close to him. You could have got him in the sack. You should have got him in the car park. Now you're going to have to take him out long range!
MATHILDE: I prefer it that way.
MATHILDE: The Socimi is the perfect weapon.
LARRY: Let's hope his workmanship is up to
LARRY: Sweden turned Jack into a liability. Three stiffs: two shooters and an innocent civilian. I can't afford a mistake like that again. Europol are crooked but they aren't cheap. Jack's supposed to make me money. Not run up cleaning He made short work of the last guy you hired.
MATHILDE: He made short work of the last guy you hired.
LARRY: Never mind Larson. He didn't stand a chance, not against someone as paranoid as Jack. The Swede was only there to take Jack's heat off you. So don't fuck this up again.
LARRY: Mind if I help myself?
LARRY: He looks around the Ford.
LARRY: Is there any actual candy in this gas guzzler?
JACK: When can I see you?
CLARA: I have to work tonight.
CLARA: You come to my apartment after.
JACK: If I asked you would you come away with me?
CLARA: Come away with you?
JACK: Why not?
CLARA: Wherever. Then when we're through, we could come back here. For good.
JACK: Wherever. Then when we're through, we could come back here. For good.
CLARA: Wherever. Then when we're through, we could come back here. For good.
JACK: Wherever. Then when we're through, we could come back here. For good.
CLARA: To live?
JACK: Where else?
CLARA: A pause.
JACK: A pause.
JACK: Unless you have other plans.
CLARA: Other plans?
CLARA: I love you, Signor Eduardo
JACK: 162 INSERT: 162
CLARA: What's happening?
JACK: Someone got what was coming to
JACK: Go to your apartment and pack. Wait `till I get there. Don't answer the door to anyone but me.
CLARA: Eduardo, please?
JACK: Trust me.
CLARA: I trust you.
JACK: Clara. My name is not Eduardo.
CLARA: My name is Jack.
JACK: My name is Jack.
CLARA: She looks worried.
CLARA: You promise you're not married?
JACK: I promise. Take this.
JACK: Look after it. In case.
CLARA: ( perplexed ) In case?
JACK: Now go.
LARRY: You're too old for this life, Jack.
LARRY: You get sentimental then you fuck things up.
JACK: What will you tell them?
FATHER BENEDETTO: I will them that the man who wrote this letter is my friend.
FATHER BENEDETTO: FATHER BENEDETTO shuts his eyes, muttering a quiet prayer. The SIRENS get closer. We hear Carabinieri screeching to a halt and clambering out of their cars, cocking submachine guns. When FATHER BENEDETTO opens his eyes again. .JACK has disappeared.
