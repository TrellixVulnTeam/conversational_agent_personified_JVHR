ANONYMOUS: Written by John Orloff
SIDE ALLEY: A cab quickly turns into the alley, coming to a screeching halt. A Man in a Grey Suit jumps out and rushes to the side entrance of a theater. In the background we see that the title of the play, "Anonymous", is written on the theatre's marquee.
PROLOGUE: Soul of the Age! The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage! Our Shakespeare, rise. Our Shakespeare. For he is all of ours, is he not? The most performed playwright of all time! The author of 37 plays, 154 sonnets, and several epic poems that are collectively known as the ultimate expressions of humanity in the English language. And yet. And yet. Not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in Shakespeare's own hand. In four hundred years, not one document be it poem, play, diary or even a simple He was born the son of a glove-maker, and at some unknown time, armed with but an elementary school education, he went to London where, the story goes, he became an actor and eventually a
OFF STAGE: A stagehand takes a wooden hammer and beats against a flat metal pate, creating the SOUNDS of THUNDER. Another stagehand starts to lift shutters in front of a stage light back and forth to create LIGHTNING STRIKES.
ON STAGE: "Prologue" opens his umbrella.
OFF STAGE: In the rafters a stagehand opens valves. It starts to
ON STAGE: "Prologue" continues, as do TITLES.
POLE: Break it down!
POLE: Jonson! Jonson!! Show yourself!
JONSON: has moved under the stage silently scurrying like a rat trying to find a place to hide among the stacks of props and costumes ( swords, masks, flags and banners, shields, barrels, canons, etc. ) But Jonson freezes when he sees
JONSON: GASPS in horror. Desperate he spies an open metal box nearby filled with un-used fireworks. He tosses the fireworks out of the box and then places the bound manuscripts in their place, then closes the box. Then he grabs a nearby rapier as
FLAMES: begin to take hold everywhere: the columns at the front of the stage. the trompe-l'oeil walls. the seating galleries. the columns.
INSERT: The fire reaches the fireworks below the theater's stage, and
THE THEATER: Timbers CRASH and fireworks EXPLODE over the theater.
INTERROGATOR: You are Benjamin Jonson, playwright? Son of William Jonson, glass-blower, son of James Jonson brick-layer?
JONSON: I'm a writer, aren't I? Of course I've bloody well been
FIGURE: Ask him about the plays.
JONSON: ( to the Interrogator ) ( to the Figure ) Which would you prefer, my lord? A pastoral? An historical? An historical-pastoral, or an hysterical historical pastoral
INTERROGATOR: We are not interested in your plays, Jonson. We are interested in the plays given to you by Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. I'm sorry my lord, but I am not sure I know whereof you speak. I have had the honor of meeting his lordship
JONSON: I'm sorry my lord, but I am not sure I know whereof you speak. I have had the honor of meeting his lordship
FACES: laughing. Not in this room, somewhere else. Somewhere outside. Before we really understand what we are seeing we are:
INTERROGATOR: Where are the plays?
MORE FACES: Laughing. We are:
TWO MEN: walk towards the theater. Edward de Vere ( 47 ), the Earl of OXFORD, an intensely handsome man. His clothes have seen better days. His companion is Henry Wriothesley, Earl of SOUTHAMPTON ( 22 ). Blonde, attractive, a bit of a pretty boy and extremely enthusiastic.
OXFORD: ( frowning slightly ) Well, it's certainly. big.
SOUTHAMPTON: I promise you, Edward, you've seen nothing like it before! Nothing!
OXFORD: Bricklayers and whores watching Aristophones? You're quite right, Henry, not only have I never witnessed it, I'm not sure I care to.
SOUTHAMPTON: ( teasing ) You're an elitist, you know that,
OXFORD: There won't be puppets, will there?
USHER: My lords.
SOUTHAMPTON: The stage-craft is quite spectacular. Far more elaborate than anything I've seen at court. I've witnessed be- headings that god as my witness look as real as at the Tower, cannons fired in battle.
SOUTHAMPTON: .and last week, they had some sort of a device to hoist cherubs into the air and fly over the entire audience!
OXFORD: An apò mekhanes theós. Deus ex machina. Machine of the Gods.
SHAKESPEARE: And whither were you riding now, Who, I? What a silly jest's that! Whither should I ride but to the O, pardon me, sir, twenty places more; your hot-house, your pig-house, or your whore-house!
"FASTIDIOUS": Who, I? What a silly jest's that! Whither should I ride but to the O, pardon me, sir, twenty places more; your hot-house, your pig-house, or your whore-house!
SHAKESPEARE: O, pardon me, sir, twenty places more; your hot-house, your pig-house, or your whore-house!
BACKSTAGE: Jonson ( now 25 and clean-shaven ) is watching the performance from behind a curtain, silently speaking the lines with the actors.
NASHE: ( takes a swig of ale ) His second play, and almost a full ( burps ) He's got a wit, does Jonson.
MARLOWE: That might be so, but like a grain of wheat hid in a bushel of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find it, and when you have it, it's not worth the search!
WOMAN: Ale! Ale!!
DEKKER: Marlowe spot me a few pence, will you? Henslowe still owes me for "Shoemaker's Holiday".
MARLOWE: ( retrieving coins ) That would be because no one saw "Shoemaker's Holiday".
DEKKER: Ale here!
NASHE: Kit. Isn't that one of your unrequited loves in the box over
MARLOWE: ( frowns ) But with whom? Tell me not he prefers the company of such old grey men as
NASHE: I think yes, by the beard, that's the Earl of Oxford. Old Tom Hooker used to play for him. Had his own acting troupe for private Court performances and the like.
DEKKER: I wonder if he needs any material?
MARLOWE: Certainly not any of yours.
NASHE: No, no that was years ago. Had a falling out with the Queen, I heard. He's more of a recluse than a patron these days.
ON STAGE: Shakespeare points to "Fastidious".
SHAKESPEARE: Who, he, the noble there? Why, he's a gull, a fool, no salt in him i' the earth; man, he looks like a fresh salmon kept in a tub! He sleeps with a musk-cat every night, and walks all day hang'd in perfumed chains for penance.
A GROUNDLING: Oi! So that's what I been smelling!
NOBLEMEN: in the box seats do not.
ON STAGE: Shakespeare continues his rant, speaking directly to the groundlings.
SHAKESPEARE: He has his skin tann'd in civet, to make his complexion strong, and the sweetness of his youth lasting in the sense of his sweet lady. And, sadly, the poor man's brain is lighter than his feather.
A NOBLEMAN: with a feathered hat gets up in fury, and exits the theater, his lady with him. The Audience LAUGHS at him as he goes.
ON STAGE: Shakespeare smiles triumphantly.
OXFORD: Watches the nobleman with the big feathered hat pass Later in the play. Shakespeare returns backstage and takes a deep swig from his tankard. He's actually drunk, though his performance didn't show it at all. He spots Jonson, and grabs him.
BACKSTAGE: Later in the play. Shakespeare returns backstage and takes a deep swig from his tankard. He's actually drunk, though his performance didn't show it at all. He spots Jonson, and grabs him.
SHAKESPEARE: Ale? Me? Drink during a performance? I am a professional sir! A complete and
POLE: This play has been declared seditious and illegal by Lord William Cecil!
A GROUNDLING: Why don't you disperse William Cecil's Arrest that man!
POLE: Arrest that man!
SOUTHAMPTON: Damn it all. Well! Off to Essex's
ON STAGE: Jonson pushes his way on stage.
JONSON: ( to Pole ) Seditious? Seditious?! It's a comedy for god's sake! There's nothing seditious about
POLE: Oi, is that right, is it? And you know this because?
JONSON: Because I wrote the bloody thing! And-
POLE: Arrest him as well!
JONSON: ( to the door ) A pox on you! ( beat ) And your carbuncled father!
ESSEX: .and how do the Cecils spend their time and energy? Shutting a theater! A theater, for god's sake? It's madness! No wonder the mob hates them
OXFORD: Essex looks furious, but holds his tongue. Southampton prepares to serve.
SOUTHAMPTON: Hmm? I'm not sure, two thousand, maybe more.
OXFORD: And how many performances are there of a play like that?
SOUTHAMPTON: Five or six I suppose.
ESSEX: By the!
OXFORD: ( to Essex ) So! Ten thousand souls. All listening to the writings of one man the ideas of one man. That's power, Robert. And if there is one thing the Cecils understand, it's power.
ESSEX: ( snorts ) And when did words ever win a kingdom? I think I'll keep my sword, thank you very much.
ESSEX: ( to the valets ) Leave us. ( they exit ) Henry. Some of my men have. intercepted. some of William Cecil's recent correspondence with King James of Scotland.
SOUTHAMPTON: To James? Elizabeth would never agree Elizabeth is old. Ill. Not of her old mind. Sometimes she doesn't even recognize me. And yet, still she refuses to name an heir.
ESSEX: Elizabeth is old. Ill. Not of her old mind. Sometimes she doesn't even recognize me. And yet, still she refuses to name an heir.
SOUTHAMPTON: But a Scotsman? On the Tudor throne?
ESSEX: You are not in the Privy Council. Elizabeth does everything the Cecils wish of her. Everything!
BEHIND THEM: Oxford enters. They don't notice, though. He instantly realizes he shouldn't say anything. He listens as:
WIDER: ESSEX ( CONT'D ) ( careful ) ( beat )
SOUTHAMPTON: You know you need not ask. I stand with you, as I always have.
OXFORD: Essex played rather poorly, didn't he?
SOUTHAMPTON: ( re: his discussion with You heard?
OXFORD: I would have you deny him.
SOUTHAMPTON: The son of the Queen?
OXFORD: That is rumor only, Henry
SOUTHAMPTON: Rumor? My god, all you have to do is look at Essex to see the Queen's reflection. Everyone thinks he's her son, everyone! And I for one would rather bow to a Tudor, bastard though he may be, than a Scotsman!
OXFORD: I desire nothing more than to see the next king be the rightful king. But what Essex contemplates will surely lead to Civil War. No. If this is to be done, it must be done carefully, skillfully.
SOUTHAMPTON: As I heard it, Elizabeth exiled you from her presence for the last twenty years because of your "skill" at Court I only have your interests in mind, Henry. For as you so rightly point out, my interests are already lost.
OXFORD: I only have your interests in mind, Henry. For as you so rightly point out, my interests are already lost.
SOUTHAMPTON: I know. Forgive me. You know how I feel about you. You have been a great friend to me ever since my father died. I promise you that I will do nothing rash without consulting you
OXFORD: Henry! Will you do me one thing more? Deliver a gift for me? A rather. elaborate gift?
SOUTHAMPTON: Sir Robert.
ROBERT CECIL: My lord of Southampton. Have you seen Essex?
SOUTHAMPTON: I believe he is still in the viewing chamber with her majesty.
ROBERT CECIL: ( sharp, annoyed )
SOUTHAMPTON: ( smiles ) With your father in London dealing with all the troubles in Ireland, who else should the Queen turn to but
FOOTMAN: By the grace of god, her majesty, Elizabeth, Queen of England, Wales and
DOUBLE DOORS: open, and Elizabeth ( in her 60's ) enters. She is wearing a large sparkling pearl-encrusted dress with a wide collar. She walks slowly and carefully, and has a slight tremor in her head and hands. She seems un-certain; like she's not sure she recognizes all the faces around her ( Alzheimer's? ). And she compensates for it by being all the more regal, all the more un-human. Essex is on her arm, dressed in a splendid jewel- encrusted doublet. Robert Cecil FROWNS at the sight of Essex on her arm. Essex ignores Cecil's glare, notices Southampton
ESSEX: ( to Elizabeth ) Ah Majesty, I've been told my lord of Southampton has a gift for you.
ELIZABETH: ( eyes sparkle ) A gift?
SOUTHAMPTON: Yes, your grace, though not from me.
ELIZABETH: Are you this gift, my precious little No, no, my most majestic majesty. I am a free man. My gift is a play, A play?
DWARF: No, no, my most majestic majesty. I am a free man. My gift is a play, A play?
ELIZABETH: A play?
ROBERT CECIL: ( to the Dwarf ) Plays are the work of the devil, born from a cesspool of plague, whoredom, thievery, fornication, and heresy. You may tell your master that her ( interrupting ) Will gladly accept your gift.
ESSEX: ( interrupting ) Will gladly accept your gift.
ELIZABETH: ( to the dwarf ) Comedy? Or tragedy?
DWARF: Comedy, majesty.
ELIZABETH: ( delighted ) A comedy!
DWARF: By. Anonymous, your majesty.
ELIZABETH: ( then ) Oh, but I do so admire his verse.
"BOTTOM": I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir from this place, do what they can.
ON STAGE: Several actors are mid-scene in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" ( Act 3, Scene 1 ), their make-up quite elaborate and fantastical: "Bottom", who is costumed as a man except that he has a DONKEY'S HEAD, "Quince", a commoner, "Puck", played by the dwarf who is now dressed like a cupid, and "Titania", Queen of the fairies, who is presently asleep in a bed of fur. Puck hides behind a tree watching.
BACKSTAGE: Oxford watches from behind a curtain, carefully observing the Queen's reaction. Somehow we feel that seeing her again after so many years stirs up some deep emotion in him.
ON STAGE: "BOTTOM" ( CONT'D ) ( sings )
"TITANIA": What angel wakes me from my flow'ry
ELIZABETH: strongly reacts to Titania awakening. It stirs some memory in her. A pleasant memory.
OXFORD: watches, delighted by her reaction.
FROM BACKSTAGE: A boy watches in the exact same position as we just saw Oxford. This is BOY OXFORD now only 10 years old. But he is made up and wears a winged costume for the character of "Puck".
ON STAGE: If we shadows have offended, think but this, and all is mended, that you have but slumber'd here while these visions did appear.
"PUCK": If we shadows have offended, think but this, and all is mended, that you have but slumber'd here while these visions did appear.
ON STAGE: "PUCK" ( CONT'D )
YOUNG ELIZABETH: Lovely. Lovely!
BOY OXFORD: I did indeed, your majesty.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: You sport with me. Compose something.
BOY OXFORD: pg. 28
YOUNG ELIZABETH: Yes. Now.
BOY OXFORD: On what subject, your grace?
YOUNG ELIZABETH: ( smiles ) ( thinks, then ) For. Truth. is Truth. Though. never so old. and time cannot make that false, which once was true.
BOY OXFORD: ( thinks, then ) For. Truth. is Truth. Though. never so old. and time cannot make that false, which once was true.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: ( to John de Vere ) My lord of Oxford. It seems you have added a poet to your family's long line of warriors.
BOY OXFORD: Madam, I am as accomplished with the sword and the musket as I am with Are you indeed?
YOUNG ELIZABETH: ( amused ) Are you indeed?
BOY OXFORD: ( nods seriously ) It is my only desire to one day be your majesty's most trusted servant in matters both of war and state, if you will but have me.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: ( charmed ) Why, Lord Cecil, it seems we may very well have found your replacement.
WILLIAM CECIL: We hope not too soon, majesty, we hope not too soon.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: ( teasing ) And how liked you our young lord's play, William?
WILLIAM CECIL: That is God's decision, your majesty. Not mine.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: Well, if plays are indeed such a sin, I pray I do not find my salvation until very late in life.
JONSON: And who are you?
WIDER: The boat approaches a large stone house, Oxford Stone.
JONSON: My lord.
OXFORD: The Tudor rose. The most beautiful of flowers, don't you think?
JONSON: It looks to me to have quite a number of thorns, my lord.
OXFORD: So it does. So it does.
JONSON: I am told, my lord, that I owe my freedom to you.
OXFORD: That is true. And it was quite hard to come by. One does not cross my father-in-law lightly.
JONSON: ( in a panicked whisper ) My lord I'm sorry, does that mean my release is not officially sanctioned?
OXFORD: Don't be an idiot Jonson, of course it But you are free, are you not?
OXFORD: I enjoyed your little comedy last week, Jonson. You have potential, great potential.
JONSON: Thank you, my lord.
OXFORD: But it's politics did seem to have quite an effect on the Tower. My father-in-law's men felt it quite Politics? My play had nothing to do with politics! It was just a simple That showed your betters as fools who go through life barely managing to get food from plate to mouth, were it not for the cleverness of their servants. All art is political, Jonson. Otherwise it would just be decoration. And all artists have something to say, otherwise. they'd make shoes. And you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson?

JONSON: A play, my lord?
OXFORD: One you shall stage Bankside.
JONSON: pg. 33
OXFORD: Under your name.
JONSON: My name, my lord?
OXFORD: I can't very well use my name, can I? I'm the seventeenth Earl of Oxford. The Lord Great Chamberlain of England, Viscount Bolebec, Lord Escales, Sandford and Badlesmere, etc, etc. No. I have a. reputation to protect. In my world, one does not write plays, Jonson. People like you
JONSON: Yes. My lord. You wrote an entire play, my lord. I know how difficult
OXFORD: Not a play, Jonson, I've written many. No doubt, many more than you yourself. A good number performed at Court years ago, others never seen by a living And you want. me to apply my name to this play?
JONSON: And you want. me to apply my name to this play?
OXFORD: No. I mean you to put your name to all of them.
JONSON: All of them?
OXFORD: Well don't look like I just gutted your pet dog, Jonson. I mean to make you the most popular and therefore the most monetarily successful playwright in all of London.
JONSON: My lord I really
FRANCESCO: That is for your trouble, Signor Jonson. And your silence. If I hear you break that silence, then. not so good for Signor Jonson.
JONSON: Hello? My lord?! I
WILLIAM CECIL: So! I am gone for three days, and you somehow manage to let her spend all of them solely in the company of the Earl of Essex.
ROBERT CECIL: He is an Earl, father. I cannot deny Of course not! You don't deny him anything. You find excuses. She is unwell, she is reading, she is seeing the Ambassador from Russia. For God's sake, use your imagination, Robert. Whatever will you do when I am gone? We will have to deal with Essex soon. His ambitions are becoming a nuisance.
WILLIAM CECIL: Of course not! You don't deny him anything. You find excuses. She is unwell, she is reading, she is seeing the Ambassador from Russia. For God's sake, use your imagination, Robert. Whatever will you do when I am gone? We will have to deal with Essex soon. His ambitions are becoming a nuisance.
WILLIAM CECIL: Now tell me about the play.
ROBERT CECIL: It it was an anonymous gift. Essex insisted it be performed, just to spite me in front of Court.
WILLIAM CECIL: Of course he did. But what was it about?
ROBERT CECIL: About? Some nonsense about fairies and cherubs.
WILLIAM CECIL: .And dancing asses? Have you any idea what you have No, how could you.
ROBERT CECIL: Father. It was just a play.
WILLIAM CECIL: And do you know how long it took me to banish them from her presence? She adores them! Adores them! And Edward knows it. Mark my words, Robert, he has done this for a purpose.
ROBERT CECIL: Purpose? What purpose?
WILLIAM CECIL: ( thinking, to himself ) What purpose indeed? ( to Robert ) But through your carelessness I must now deal not only with Essex, but Edward as well. For whether in shadow or in person, Edward has returned to
YOUNG ANNE: I am sorry for your loss, my lord. The realm lost a great lord with your father's death. We hope you will be happy in our house
YOUNG OXFORD: ( smiles ) No. Only until I reach my maturity.
WILLIAM CECIL: Because the Queen has bade it so. My lord, when we first met, you said you wished to become a great man of State. Both the Queen and I hope to make that so.
YOUNG OXFORD: Monsieur. Ca me fait plaisir de vous
WILLIAM CECIL: Nine to ten is Greek with Mister Dalon, an d'ego, hoti mathamata ge esti ha trafo psychas.
YOUNG OXFORD: ( in Greek ) Dalon, an d'ego, hoti mathamata ge esti ha trafo psychas.
YOUNG OXFORD: ( sharp ) No. Plato.
WILLIAM CECIL: ( slight frown, then ) And you know your uncle, Mister Golding, who has petitioned me to allow you to assist him in his translations of ancient Latin texts into English.
YOUNG OXFORD: ( in Latin ) Continetne, ut spero, Ovidii Metamorphose? Mihi honori erit,
WILLIAM CECIL: Then cosmography with Doctor Richards. Two to three is geography and history, and four to five fencing.
YOUNG OXFORD: ( to William Cecil ) And composition? Poetry?
WILLIAM CECIL: This is a Puritan home, your grace. We believe such activities to be the worship of false idols, and therefore a sin before the eyes of God.
YOUNG OXFORD: A sin? But surely there must be room for beauty and art in life, my lord.
WILLIAM CECIL: Not in this household.
WIDER: Boy Robert Cecil looks up, his face furious, to see Young Oxford coming over to him.
YOUNG OXFORD: You were losing anyway.
YOUNG OXFORD: 34 INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 34
POEMS: neatly written on parchment. We are:
WRITING DESK: where the parchments are scattered.
YOUNG OXFORD: goes to his desk, picks up one of the pieces of parchment. It has poetry on it. His poetry. He goes through some other pages. And realizes other pages are missing. He becomes infuriated. He sees
WIDER: Young Oxford CHARGES the tapestry, sword in hand. He THRUSTS the sword THROUGH the tapestry. The man screams in agony as he falls. He doesn't just die, but screams and screams and screams. Young Oxford steps back half in horror. half in triumph. The SOUND of APPLAUSE takes us to:
BACKSTAGE: where Jonson stands holding the manuscript Oxford gave him.
SHAKESPEARE: Is it any good?
JONSON: How in blazes should I know?
SHAKESPEARE: You haven't even read it?
ON STAGE: where he bows again, then steps
BACKSTAGE: so Jonson can answer him.
JONSON: I read a line or two I promised Henslowe I'd finish "Eastward Ho" by And you say he's a nobleman?
SHAKESPEARE: And you say he's a nobleman?
JONSON: I tell you Will I came to London to become a great poet, to, to, be the conscience of our times, the soul of our age! To change the world, not to become someone else's
SHAKESPEARE: ( amused ) Change the world? With rhyme?
JONSON: Yes, why not? Why can't a man change the world with words?
SHAKESPEARE: You know, it's actually not half
JONSON: Not half?! You're an actor, what in God's name do you know about writing?! He's an amateur, Will, a complete and utter amateur. Last week gardening, this week playwrighting, next week No. I won't do it. It would be an affront against the Muses.
SHAKESPEARE: ( smiles ) Well we musn't offend the muses, whatever we do. ( thinks, then ) How much money did you say he gave What, you think my name can be bought, if the number's great enough, do you?
JONSON: What, you think my name can be bought, if the number's great enough, do you?
SHAKESPEARE: No, not at all. I think we should keep your good name quite intact, thank you very much.
ELIZABETH: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN ( THEN INTERCUT EACH SIDE OF SCREEN AS NEEDED ) William Cecil hasn't realized that his son Robert has sneaked in the room behind him to listen in.
WILLIAM CECIL: There are rumors of his sending financial aid, and even troops. We must act quickly. We must replace the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and send additional troops immediately, majesty.
ELIZABETH: Replace? With whom?
WILLIAM CECIL: I would recommend the Earl of Essex, your majesty.
ELIZABETH: Essex? To Ireland? For how long?
WILLIAM CECIL: As long as the present crisis warrants, majesty.
ELIZABETH: Impossible. He cannot be spared. We feel his counsel is of greater import with each passing day.
WILLIAM CECIL: I only recommend we send your most able subjects where they are most needed, majesty. Philip of Spain dreams still of taking your kingdom from you.
ELIZABETH: But Essex?
WILLIAM CECIL: Essex's martial abilities are, in my opinion, the only antidote to the plague of Philip. Though, Essex would not, unfortunately, be able to remain in the Privy Council if he is in And who would you advise to replace
ELIZABETH: And who would you advise to replace
WILLIAM CECIL: Sir Robert Cecil.
ELIZABETH: Your son?
WILLIAM CECIL: He is my own advisor first, my son second, majesty. His counsel has been invaluable to me, and no doubt will be to you as well.
ELIZABETH: Yes, yes, yes. We will send Essex to Ireland and place Robert on my Privy
WILLIAM CECIL: By your own hand!
YOUNG OXFORD: He was stealing my poems.
WILLIAM CECIL: He was doing my bidding!
YOUNG OXFORD: WILLIAM CECIL
WILLIAM CECIL: Of course. As soon as Robert informed me that you were disobeying my Robert? Robert told
YOUNG OXFORD: Robert? Robert told
WILLIAM CECIL: Enough! Thou shalt not worship false idols in my household! Your everlasting soul hangs in the balance. Not poems. Your soul!
YOUNG OXFORD: My poems are my soul! You have placed me in a grave position, Edward.
WILLIAM CECIL: You have placed me in a grave position, Edward.
YOUNG OXFORD: Sir. For the last three years you have managed to seize much of my Hold your tongue, Edward, before you make a claim you cannot retract! I have been legally reimbursed for your education and living expenses.
WILLIAM CECIL: Hold your tongue, Edward, before you make a claim you cannot retract! I have been legally reimbursed for your education and living expenses.
YOUNG OXFORD: And now you suggest you be "reimbursed" the rest of my once considerable estates through your daughter's bed?
WILLIAM CECIL: No. This is how I suggest you keep your noble head from the executioner's
YOUNG OXFORD: stares at him. The SOUND of CHURCH BELLS RINGING takes us to:
BISHOP: .and in the fear of god, duly considering the causes for which matrimony was ordained. One was the procreation of children.
WILLIAM CECIL: appears triumphant. He looks beaming over to.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: Who presides over the whole affair. The first time we see a dress on her which makes her truly regal.
NASHE: "Henry V" by. No one?
MARLOWE: And why would any of you admit to trying to better me in a historical drama? Comedy, yes, tragedy, perhaps. But never will one of you best me in
ON STAGE: An actor, CONDELL ( 40's ), dressed all in white ( even his face is painted white ) enters stage. He is "Prologue". He addresses the audience directly.
"PROLOGUE": Oh, for a muse of fire, that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention. A kingdom for a stage, princes to act, and monarchs to behold the swelling scene! Then should warlike Harry, like himself, assume the port of Mars, and at his heels should famine, sword, and fire crouch for his employment. Can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?
HORSE HOOVES: as they POUND on cobblestone. We are:
"HENRY V": This day is called the feast of Crispian: he that outlives this day, and comes safe home, will stand a tip- toe when this day is named, and rouse him at the name of Crispian.
ON STAGE: "Henry V" speaks to his men.
THE GROUNDLINGS: become literally spellbound.
OXFORD: watches, with a pride he has never felt.
ON STAGE: My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed. The French are bravely in their battles set and will with all expedience charge on us.
"SALISBURY": My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed. The French are bravely in their battles set and will with all expedience charge on us.
"HENRY V": All things are ready, if our minds be Perish the man whose mind is backward
"WESTMORELAND": Perish the man whose mind is backward
"HENRY V": You know your places: God be with you
THE "HUT": which is a round tower on top of the stage, contains several small cannons manned by stagehands. They shoot
OXFORD'S BOX: He sees Oxford, who is applauding. All the actors of the play are taking their bows.
SOUTHAMPTON: William Cecil's convinced the Queen that only Essex can save Ireland from the Revolt.
OXFORD: I ask for your blessing, Edward.
SOUTHAMPTON: I ask for your blessing, Edward.
OXFORD: I can't give it to you.
NASHE: I for one wish to see this anonymous colleague of ours. Playwright! Playwright!!
BACKSTAGE: Shakespeare, standing next to a small table of props, quickly dips his fingers in an inkwell to make them stained. He grabs a large feathered quill and tucks a piece of parchment under his arm, then hurries
ON STAGE: where he bows deeply, loving the adulation.
SOUTHAMPTON: If he is to be my king, then it is my sacred duty to be with him in battle.
JONSON: who guiltily looks away. Marlowe's mouth is open, his hands stop applauding.
OXFORD: Henry Henry!!
ON STAGE: Shakespeare bows, then
SHAKESPEARE: I, I. It's been. I, I, want to. thank my actors, whose great acting brought. my words. to life due to their most finest acting. Ah. Thank you.
OXFORD: An actor for god's sake?
JONSON: My lord, I thought that
OXFORD: You presumed to think? On my behalf? Whatever made you believe you had that
JONSON: My lord, your voice is completely different than mine. My, my, my characters are
OXFORD: Voice? You have no voice! That's why I chose you! You at least kept my name from him?
JONSON: ( amazed ) All, my lord? Is that possible?
OXFORD: Of course it is!
ANNE: Who was that man? I've seen him Edward we must discuss our Bridget's
OXFORD: ( looking up - confused )
ANNE: She cannot go into marriage without a dowry that is becoming to the daughter of the Earl Oxford.
OXFORD: I can give her Brooke House and a hundred pounds.
BRIDGET: A hundred pounds? Father? Mother!
OXFORD: That is all we have to give at the
ANNE: ( furious ) Edward. Edward! Speak to me! Our family is in financial ruins, and, and you, you play the flute while Rome
OXFORD: Nero fiddled whilst Rome burned.
ANNE: For god's sake, who cares Edward? When your own daughter can't even have a suitable dowry?
OXFORD: Anne If you could have seen them the mob. They, they didn't just sit there like the reptilia of court, faces motionless, fangs momentarily retracted. No! They, they jumped on stage, they fought the French! A butcher he actually broke his arm! He was so
ANNE: Stop! Stop it at once!!
OXFORD: The voices, Anne. The voices. I, I can't stop them. They, they come when I sleep, when I wake, when I sup, when I, I, I walk down a hall! The sweet longings of a maiden, the, the surging ambitions of a courtier, the foul designs of a murderer, the wretched pleas of his victims. Only- - only when I put their words their voices to parchment are they cast loose, freed. Only then is my mind. quieted. at peace.
ANNE: Art thou possessed?
OXFORD: I. don't know.
SHAKESPEARE: "From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean." Incredible!! The whole bloody thing in verse?!
JONSON: ( nonchalant ) It's really not that difficult, if you And have you ever tried?
SHAKESPEARE: And have you ever tried?
JONSON: You can't play Romeo. Why not? I won't let that oaf Spencer have another go at one of my roles. No only Will Shakespeare can pump the life into Romeo's veins. And his cod piece! Ben Ben! I'm an actor, every inch of me, down to my very toes. I want- - no, I need, crave to act. I can't just idle the day by with
SHAKESPEARE: ( to Jonson ) Why not? I won't let that oaf Spencer have another go at one of my roles. No only Will Shakespeare can pump the life into Romeo's veins. ( grins at another passing And his cod piece! ( beat, desperate ) Ben Ben! I'm an actor, every inch of me, down to my very toes. I want- - no, I need, crave to act. I can't just idle the day by with
JONSON: So bloody well act like a writer! And for God's sake, keep off the stage. Writers don't have time to act.
"ROMEO": What lady's that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight?
"SERVANT": I know not, sir.
"ROMEO": O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear; beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
THE WOMEN: respond, eye lashes twittering.
THE WITS: Watch in awe! Now they're all taking swigs of ale.
BACKSTAGE: Shakespeare mouthing silently the lines of "Romeo".
YOUNG ELIZABETH: seems less than interested in her dancing partner. She STARES intently back at Young Oxford.
WIDER: There is a natural change in the music, and all the dancers switch partners it's part of the dance. Young Oxford goes to Young Elizabeth, the Spanish Ambassador goes to Anne.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: My lord of Oxford.
OXFORD: Did he?
YOUNG ELIZABETH: Rash, yet brave. A boy and yet a man. Fair on the eyes, fairer to the
WIDER: Much of the Court is watching this. They can tell there are sparks between them. All the dancers change partners, including Elizabeth and Oxford. A few dance moves, and Oxford once again finds himself with Elizabeth.
YOUNG OXFORD: If I had known my absence would cause your grace so much. longing, I would have returned much much sooner. Your wife must be much pleased by your presence once more at her side.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: Your wife must be much pleased by your presence once more at her side.
YOUNG ANNE: who is now dancing with the Spanish Ambassador. But she watches Young Elizabeth and Young Oxford with a great deal of jealousy.
WILLIAM CECIL: Follows his daughter's look. He doesn't like what he sees any more than Young Anne does.
YOUNG OXFORD: If she is, it is but a small comfort to me. I am returned only under my father-in-law's insistence.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: ( surprised ) Cecil had told me your match was one of love.
YOUNG OXFORD: And so he would wish. But how could one ever love the moon, after having first seen the sun?
BESSIE: My lord. Her majesty went riding with the Earl of Oxford.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: And which country did you like the most on your travels, my lord?
YOUNG OXFORD: I think Italy, your grace.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: And why is that? The weather? The No their theater, which they call la Commedia dell'arte. And, of course, the women.
YOUNG OXFORD: No their theater, which they call la Commedia dell'arte. And, of course, the women.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: The women?
YOUNG OXFORD: They were more. clear with their desires than our English ladies. When they want something, they take it. They do not wait to be taken.
LATER: Postcoital, the fire still lit. Young Elizabeth is half asleep, half awake, nestled in furs in front of the fireplace. much like Titania in "Midsummer Night's Dream". Young Oxford watches her as she stirs and wakes. She smiles at him.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: I can't decide. Are you Prince Hal.? Or Romeo? No. Benedick,
YOUNG OXFORD: ( smiles ) Yes, Puck!
YOUNG ELIZABETH: Yes, Puck!
YOUNG OXFORD: Ah, but Puck would never fight for you in the Netherlands.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: ( surprised, smiles ) The Netherlands? Well, why not? It's an open secret on the continent that you support the rebels against Spain and that you are commissioning Englishmen to help their cause. Spain's loss is England's gain, is it not?
YOUNG OXFORD: Well, why not? It's an open secret on the continent that you support the rebels against Spain and that you are commissioning Englishmen to help their cause. Spain's loss is England's gain, is it not?
YOUNG ELIZABETH: Is this why you bedded me? For a No. No of course not I
YOUNG OXFORD: No. No of course not I
YOUNG ELIZABETH: Leave me. Leave at once!
YOUNG OXFORD: YOUNG ELIZABETH
YOUNG ELIZABETH: How dare you! How dare you!! I command you to leave my presence.
YOUNG OXFORD: O Mistress mine, where are you O stay and hear. your true-love's That can kiss both high and low.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: ( passionately ) You will stay in England. And in. my chambers.
MARLOWE: ( to Nashe ) Do what?
NASHE: ( a little drunk ) A play in iambic, in iambic pen.in- bic-pentameter. It's not that hard.
JONSON: Think you so? Have you ever tried?
NASHE: Of course not. But I could if I It wasn't all in verse.
DEKKER: It wasn't all in verse.
NASHE: Ha! See! Even easier!
SHAKESPEARE: ( excited ) Henslowe wants "Romeo" to run a ( unbelievable news ) A fortnight! Innkeeper! A round for everybody! Inkeeper!! ( no response )
NASHE: A fortnight?
DEKKER: The maids love the romantic tragedies.
MARLOWE: Precisely why I avoid them.
NASHE: Aw, well. No worries. A one-trick pony. He'll never be able to do it
"TWELFTH NIGHT": Viola and Sebastian are reunited.
"CAESAR": Caesar is attacked by Brutus, Cinna, Cassius, etc.
"MACBETH": The witches are on stage. These three performances are INTER-CUT with:
PLAYBILLS: outside the Rose, announcing each play's title. At first, Shakespeare's name is small, with each succeeding play his name gets bigger. And
A PLAYBILL: in front of the theater announcing "William Shakespeare's Hamlet". Shakespeare's name is now above the title. We HEAR the audience howl with LAUGHTER as
"POLONIUS": ( over-acting ) .Beware of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, bear it that the opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice, take each man's censure, but reserve thy
"POLINOUS": ..Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, but not expressed in fancy, rich, nor gaudy, for the apparel oft proclaims the man. This above all, to thine own self be true.
"GERTRUDE": What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me? Help, ho!
"POLONIUS": ( behind curtain ) What ho, help!
"HAMLET": How now? A rat? Dead, for a ducat,
"POLONIUS": O, I am slain. Not a day too soon for old Cecil!!
GROUNDLING: Not a day too soon for old Cecil!!
"GERTRUDE": O me, what hast thou done?
"HAMLET": Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
JONSON: Looks over to Oxford with astonishment. While on stage the world sees for the first time "Hamlet" contemplating suicide.
"HAMLET": To be, or not to be: that is the question: whether `tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them.
"HAMLET': .To die, to sleep- no more- and by a sleep to say we end the heartache, and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.
SHAKESPEARE: Bows to the thunderous applause. It is still raining, but nobody wants to leave. While-
ON STAGE: some of the audience members grab Shakespeare, and pull him on their shoulders, carrying him triumphantly out of the theater.
POLE: ( looks up ) Are you certain of this? ( almost confused ) William Cecil was murdered?
MARLOWE: Not literally, of course. He was a character, a fictional character. But the metaphor was clear for anyone to see. And see, they did.
POLE: That is not for me to decide.
ROBERT CECIL: Not only in front of Court! But the entire City as well! We must arrest this Shakespeare and-
WILLIAM CECIL: No, Robert, think. If he is really as popular as you say, we would only anger the mob. No. We must strike at Edward directly.
ROBERT CECIL: But we cannot maintain our authority if the mob thinks us laughing stocks
WILLIAM CECIL: ( angry ) Our authority comes from Elizabeth and from God! Elizabeth! Elizabeth is the key to all.
WILLIAM CECIL: James knows of the Queen's affection for Essex. and the rumors of his birth. He is justly concerned. You will reply to him.
ROBERT CECIL: I will reply to him?
WILLIAM CECIL: I am dying, Robert We both know this to be true. And I will not witness the next coronation.
LATER: Robert Cecil wheels his father in.
WILLIAM CECIL: Help me to my bed, my son. If we are to secure your place at the side of the next king, you must get that king his throne, not I.
ROBERT CECIL: ( confused )
WILLIAM CECIL: He uses the tools at his disposal, as we use the tools at ours. But ours will win. as they always have.
ROBERT CECIL: ( more confused ) I I don't understand, father. What does Edward
WILLIAM CECIL: Edward seeks what we seek. To choose the next King.
WILLIAM CECIL: Are you certain?
BESSIE: Two cycles have passed, my lord.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: I wish to marry him.
WILLIAM CECIL: Marry him, your grace? He is already I can do what I will.
YOUNG ELIZABETH: I can do what I will.
WILLIAM CECIL: Can you?
YOUNG ELIZABETH: I love him.
WILLIAM CECIL: Would you risk your throne for him? Would you risk England for him?
YOUNG ELIZABETH: And Edward?
WILLIAM CECIL: He must never know.
YOUNG OXFORD: What have you done?
WILLIAM CECIL: I am praying.
YOUNG OXFORD: ( ignoring him ) She won't see me! I've gone to her chambers three times, and she will not receive me. And now she's gone! She's on Progress.
WILLIAM CECIL: She's on Progress.
YOUNG OXFORD: Where? Where did she go?
WILLIAM CECIL: The Queen does not ask for my advice about matters of the heart, Edward. If she had, she hardly would have chosen you for her pleasure.
JONSON: ( shrugs ) Perhaps they haven't noticed..
MARLOWE: I made sure they did.
JONSON: You informed on one of your own? To the Tower?
MARLOWE: Watch who you judge, Ben, for as God is my witness, you may well find yourself doing the same before you meet your maker. We do what we have to, to survive, and survive well, in this life. All of us. And Will is definitely not one of us. You know he's illiterate, don't you?
JONSON: Why are you here, Kit?
MARLOWE: ( smiles ) So who did write it? You? No. You'd take credit for it. No.
JONSON: You've had too much to drink, Kit. You're beginning to sound like one of your plays.
MARLOWE: Ben! Tell me. We can go to him together. Guarantee his anonymity. for a price.
JONSON: You reported on me as well, didn't you, Kit? Last year. That's why I was arrested, wasn't it? Because you went to the Tower?
MARLOWE: ( lying ) Ben, Ben. I had nothing to do with
CLOSER: Essex's tent is larger, and guarded. An OLD SERVANT carrying a tray with a silver pitcher approaches. A guard opens the tent for him to enter.
ESSEX: ( pointing ) If the Rebels have stripped the northern borders. Then we must march south. and take Cahir
GENERAL: ( clears throat, My lord. `Tis a well-defended fortress. Two thousand men at least. We cannot
ESSEX: So what would you have me do? Spend the entire spring encamped? I am sent to Ireland to end this infernal rebellion, not idle my days with
SOUTHAMPTON: In an instant Southampton draws a silver engraved pistol and SHOOTS the servant! Everyone is shocked but then we see:
THE SERVANT: had drawn his own, small wooden pistol.
ESSEX: shares a look with Southampton.
CLOSER: They wear outfits that are slightly more protective than ornamental. They duel for a few moments, and then Oxford TOUCHES Beaulieu's shoulder. The speak entirely in French.
BEAULIEU: Oxford backs off, as does the fencing master.
OXFORD: ( in French ) Bien. Faisons du travail. le Coup droit d'autorité?
BEAULIE: Mais oui, mon seigneur.
OXFORD: Bien. En garde!
FRANCESCO: Signor? Signor?!
OXFORD: Beaulieu he, he tried to kill me.
JONSON: ( to a passer-by ) What's all that, then?
MAN: A body.
A BODY: on its back in the alley. Someone turns it over. It's MARLOWE, a dried stab-wound in his eye.
JONSON: is stunned.
BEAR BAITER: Sampson! Sired by the great Arthur himself! No dog's yet been bred that can take him down!
SHAKESPEARE: I need more money.
JONSON: More? You already make more than any playwright Bankside.
BEAR BAITER: But then here, good friends, I bring you a pack of dogs so fierce, so dangerous, that Medusa herself would shrink in fear!
SHAKESPEARE: I'm going to build my own theater, Ben, one that fits the scale of my work
JONSON: Your work?
BEAR BAITER: Not a one has had a morsel of food in a week! Bred by the great John Sinclow!
A MAN: Fourpence on three dogs!
SHAKESPEARE: They insist only a gentleman can own the A shilling on four!
ANOTHER MAN: A shilling on four!
SHAKESPEARE: The bribes are outrageous, but I found some one who will make me a coat-of-arms, and change the Stratford lists for me.
JONSON: ANOTHER MAN
ANOTHER MAN: Eight shillings on six dogs! Eight shillings on six dogs!
JONSON: I'll take that bet!! Eight shillings on the bear, six dogs!
ANOTHER MAN: Bad bet, that.
SHAKESPEARE: Bad bet, that.
JONSON: ( to Shakespeare ) You'll have to make do with what you've got. I won't be your beggar.
SHAKESPEARE: This isn't a request, Ben. I'll have more money.
JONSON: Or what? You'll slit my throat like you did Kit's?
MAN: Release the dogs! Release the dogs!
JONSON: I know he went to see you last night, Will. And I know he was planning to expose you if you didn't agree to his
WIDER: Shakespeare stares at Jonson.
SHAKESPEARE: ( dead serious ) You're mad, Ben. Kit was my friend.
JONSON: Be careful, Will. You kill me off too, and you won't have any good plays to act in after this is all done.
SHAKESPEARE: I'll have my guineas, Ben. One way or another, I'll have my guineas.
DOGS: start to go for the bear's throat. Thge cheering goes to a roar as we
SHAKESPEARE: Wears a beard and fake nose. He tries to stay hidden so Jonson doesn't see him. We are:
OXFORD: So! You are the famous Shakespeare whose labors I have enjoyed so much. I am at your service, sir.
SHAKESPEARE: My lord I- I need more money.
OXFORD: ( sharp ) I beg your pardon?
SHAKESPEARE: My expenses have, ah, aggrandized. since this all began.
OXFORD: And if, if your lordship doesn't agree to an increase in my, ah, fee, I shall be forced to make certain. facts Have you any idea to whom you are I am addressing the writer of Hamlet. of Juliet and her Romeo. Am I not?
SHAKESPEARE: And if, if your lordship doesn't agree to an increase in my, ah, fee, I shall be forced to make certain. facts Have you any idea to whom you are I am addressing the writer of Hamlet. of Juliet and her Romeo. Am I not?
FRANCESCO: Have you any idea to whom you are I am addressing the writer of Hamlet. of Juliet and her Romeo. Am I not?
SHAKESPEARE: I am addressing the writer of Hamlet. of Juliet and her Romeo. Am I not?
FRANCESCO: Out. Get out! How dare you insult my master in
OXFORD: ( beat ) How much?
SHAKESPEARE: Four hundred pounds. A year.
FRANCESCO: A year?
OXFORD: Pay him.
FRANCESCO: Forgive me for speaking of things above my place or understanding, signor. But. Is this wise? They have already tried to kill you once.
OXFORD: Wisdom, Francesco, is a quality I have unfortunately never possessed.
BESSIE: Edward. You know she would be furious if she found out about this.
YOUNG OXFORD: No. She abandoned me.
BESSIE: You don't know, do you?
WILLIAM CECIL: I cannot be certain, majesty, when the. relationship began.
WILLIAM CECIL: But sometime soon after your return to You're sure?
YOUNG ELIZABETH: You're sure?
WILLIAM CECIL: They they haven't been very discreet, majesty. I presume he wanted you to know. To. to hurt
YOUNG ELIZABETH: Arrest them. Arrest them both!
WILLIAM CECIL: Your whore gave birth last week.
YOUNG OXFORD: WILLIAM CECIL ( beat )
WILLIAM CECIL: No. You have the freedom of the kingdom. Just not of the Court. Those are her terms. Here are mine. You will go back to my daughter. You will make some effort to make her happy and you will finally act according to your station in life, and accept the responsibilities of your great title.
YOUNG OXFORD: My lord! I, too, have a condition.
WILLIAM CECIL: I don't know if the whore has even delivered the
YOUNG OXFORD: No. The other one.
WILLIAM CECIL: The other one? Who told you?
YOUNG OXFORD: I will go back to your daughter. I will make you as many grandchildren as she can bare.
WILLIAM CECIL: There is no record of his true birth, no trail that leads to you, or the. mother. His foster parents never knew the truth, and both are now dead.
YOUNG OXFORD: The name?
WILLIAM CECIL: Make even a hint of this to the child, or anyone else, and this agreement is void, and I'll see your head on the block within a fortnight. And the boy's as well.
YOUNG OXFORD: ( excited ) It's a boy.?
BOY: YOUNG OXFORD
YOUNG OXFORD: Young Oxford smiles at the boy.
BOY: My lord.
YOUNG OXFORD: They tell me one day you're to be an Earl as well.
BOY: I shall be the Earl of Southampton.
YOUNG OXFORD: ( smiling ) Well then, we shall be Earls together, shan't we?
ELIZABETH: looking completely stricken, approaches the coffin, holding Cecil's white cane. She places it at his side. In the background we hear the Archbishop of Canterbury reading from the bible.
ROBERT CECIL: scans the room, to see how it is all playing out.
OXFORD: watches stoically, his wife and children at his side.
ELIZABETH: We wish to recall Essex from
ROBERT CECIL: A wise decision, your majesty. If nothing else, it will give him an opportunity to respond to all these
ELIZABETH: ROBERT CECIL
ROBERT CECIL: I'm sorry, majesty, I thought you'd Heard what?
ELIZABETH: Heard what?
ROBERT CECIL: Essex is in negotiations with Philip of Spain.
ELIZABETH: Peace is at hand. We know this.
ROBERT CECIL: Majesty it is said that Essex has promised Phillip all of Catholic Ireland in return for.
ELIZABETH: In return for what?
ROBERT CECIL: Spain's support of Essex's claim to the throne of England.
ELIZABETH: Bring him to me, William. Bring him to me at once!
ROBERT CECIL: ( correcting ) Robert, majesty.
HORSE HOOVES: as they gallop over emerald green grasses. We are:
MESSENGER: My lord.
SOUTHAMPTON: She can't believe this.
ESSEX: Oh, can't she?
SOUTHAMPTON: It's Robert Cecil. He failed to kill you, now he tries to kill your name.
ESSEX: We leave with the tide!
SHAKESPEARE: Well, I've got it!
NASHE: It's quite. colorful.
DEKKER: What in blazes is it?
SHAKESPEARE: My coat-of-arms! It cost a bloody fortune, but, by god, you can call me gentleman now!
DEKKER: I can't quite make out the motto. Non sanz. Non.
SHAKESPEARE: "Non sanz droict".
NASHE: Not without
JONSON: Right!? Not without right? You went to him, didn't you? You lying knave you went to him!
SHAKESPEARE: ( smiles ) Ben. Ben! Let me buy you a
JONSON: What? You've already killed off one competitor. Now you want another dead as well? I don't know what you mean. Ben, we should really
SHAKESPEARE: I don't know what you mean. Ben, we should really
JONSON: I swore to him I wouldn't tell you his name. Swore it! Do you have any idea what he might do to me? Do you?
SHAKESPEARE: Ben you've had too much to drink.
JONSON: Unhand me!
SHAKESPEARE: You haven't got any ink.
ESSEX: ( to Southampton ) Wait for me.
CONTINUOUS: where Elizabeth is still dressing, putting on make- up, etc. She is NOT wearing her wig, and is only wearing her undergarments. She looks quite ugly. She turns to see Essex, shocked at his intrusion. Essex FREEZES. He knows he has just made an enormous She stares at him, horrified to be seen in such a manner. The she regains her composure and
ESSEX: Majesty, I, I.
ELIZABETH: Get out! Out!!!
ELIZABETH: Who in God's name does he think he is? Abandoning his post without my leave! Coming into our presence in such a manner, neither announced nor invited, half his army in my courtyard. He's gone mad. mad!
ROBERT CECIL: No. Unfortunately for us, your majesty, he is quite sane. He simply believes he is your royal equal.
OXFORD: I am Edward, Earl of Oxford.
SOUTHAMPTON: Edward! Edward! Thank god you're
OXFORD: ( shrugs )
ESSEX: She won't accept my letters. I cannot get to her. Cecil plans to arrest me any day. I know it. But that won't be as easy as he Fight him in London, and you only validate every rumor and lie Cecil has ever told about you.
OXFORD: Fight him in London, and you only validate every rumor and lie Cecil has ever told about you.
ESSEX: Then what do you suggest I do? Let myself be arrested so I can be tried and executed for crimes I did not No. I will go to Elizabeth, myself, How? Cecil won't let her see a letter without reading it first.
OXFORD: No. I will go to Elizabeth, myself, How? Cecil won't let her see a letter without reading it first.
ESSEX: How? Cecil won't let her see a letter without reading it first.
OXFORD: I won't send her a letter. I will send her a book.
ESSEX: And the mob? How will I
OXFORD: Leave that to me.
FRANCESCO: ( to the whore ) Hold your tongue, whore, and get out!
WHORE: Oi. `Oo's going to pay me then?
OXFORD: You shall begin rehearsals immediately. But it is not to be performed until I tell you. And you may only have a day's notice.
SHAKESPEARE: That will be expensive keeping all the actors ready. Having the props made but not
OXFORD: Oh, and congratulations. You've had an epic poem published today.
SHAKESPEARE: ( confused ) Published? You mean like in a book?
ELIZABETH: standing across the room. How much has she heard?
WIDER: They all stand abruptly, worried. The women who was reading the book puts it down on a table. Elizabeth silently walks over to them, and picks up the book. She opens it as we
ELIZABETH: ( turns ) You find me disgusting, don't you? Repugnant. Wrinkled?
ROBERT CECIL: You, you are the sun, majesty. The glory of
ELIZABETH: Robert Cecil shuts his mouth.
ROBERT CECIL: ( hint of a smile ) Which one, your majesty?
ELIZABETH: His. Mine. He still lives?
ROBERT CECIL: ( hesitates ) Yes. your majesty.
ELIZABETH: Robert Cecil hesitates.
ROBERT CECIL: His grace, the Earl of. Southampton, your majesty.
CECIL: Majesty. You are not having doubts about James of Scotland succeeding you, are you?
ELIZABETH: James?! He is the son of Mary! She plotted and schemed to steal the throne from under me! No son of hers will rule while a yet Tudor lives!
"GLOUCESTER": ( in character ) But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, nor made to court an amorous
SPENCER: Good part, that.
"GLOUCESTER": .and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as I halt by them. Is this wise?
BURBAGE: It's only the one performance. Go on!
"GLOUCESTER": I need a drink.
JONSON: ( to Burbage ) Burbage. Wonderful theater. Wonderful! The best Bankside! But only one performance? Is it that bad?
BURBAGE: Hardly, it's Will's new play. Richard the Third. We've been hired to perform it free to the public.
JONSON: Aye. Some anonymous nobleman paid for everything. God knows Will never would. Been rehearsing all week, just found out this morning, we go up next Monday.
BURBAGE: Aye. Some anonymous nobleman paid for everything. God knows Will never would. Been rehearsing all week, just found out this morning, we go up next Monday.
JONSON: ( grins ) My best so far. I guarantee more than one performance. Though I'll not pay for the tickets myself. ( winks ) No need to.
BURBAGE: Sorry, Ben.
MAN: ( to a woman ) You doin' tomorrow?
WOMAN: You askin?
MAN: Managed to get two tickets to Shakespeare's latest. Cost me a Ballocks, did it! They're giving them away free. Best villain in the history of theater, Richard the Third. No doubt.
PASSING MAN: Ballocks, did it! They're giving them away free. Best villain in the history of theater, Richard the Third. No doubt.
SPENCER: Best villain in the history of theater, Richard the Third. No doubt.
HEMINGE: Come on. Better than Mephistopheles?
SPENCER: No doubt! Your Marlowe god rest his soul is fine for your everyday scalawag, and your Jonson won't even try the hard drama. No, this is Shakespeare, for god's sake! The man knows drama. I tell you, not even the Greeks compare! To Shakespeare! And villainy!
ALL: To Shakespeare! And villainy!
WHORE: Fancy a tumble? Only sixpence!
POLE: I haven't got all day, man.
JONSON: I. There is a there is a play to be performed. on Monday.
POLE: There's many plays to be performed next Monday, isn't there?
JONSON: Yes, my lord, but this one is to be performed one performance, and one performance only. On Monday. All Bankside is talking of it. The History of King Richard the Third. By William Shakespeare.
POLE: I know who Richard the Third was.
JONSON: Yes. Of course you do. But in William Shakespeare's version, he is played as a hunch-back.
BURBAGE: We have to turn `em away by the hundreds! Look! Never seen anything quite like it!
NASHE: So! I heard the Earl of Essex paid for this whole performance! Man's never even been to the theater, and still he's heard of Will
DEKKER: Essex!? Impossible. My cousin's one of his men-at-arms. Hasn't been paid in weeks. They're all just sitting there, Waiting? Waiting for what?
JONSON: Waiting? Waiting for what?
DEKKER: Wants to have an audience with the Queen. As if Cecil would ever let Essex near her By the mass, Cecil in favor, Essex out! Who can keep up with it all!?
NASHE: By the mass, Cecil in favor, Essex out! Who can keep up with it all!?
ON STAGE: "GLOUCESTER", the future Richard III, enters. He is hunch-backed, and looks as much like Robert Cecil as possible in terms of beard and costume. First the people are in stunned silence, but then like magic the hissing starts. It is followed by more hissing and the first boos. The actor playing Gloucester nervously looks around.
DEKKER: ( to Nashe ) Tired of politics are you? Seems you picked the wrong day to come to the theater, then.
ON STAGE: "Gloucester" addresses the audience.
"GLOUCESTER": Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York. Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front..
FRANCESCO: in the audience. But among the Groundlings, not in Oxford's usual box seat.
JONSON: looks over to Oxford's box. It's empty.
"GLOUCESTER": .and now instead of mounting barded steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries, he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute. But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, nor made to court an amorous looking-
"GLOUCESTER": .and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as I halt by them.
"GLOUCESTER": And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover, I am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days.
ESSEX: Edward knows what he is doing. Does he not?
SOUTHAMPTON: He promised us a mob. They'll be
FRANCESCO: A pox on Cecil!
NASHE: Why is Oxford's man with the Groundlings?
BACKSTAGE: Shakespeare and Burbage exchange a worried glance.
"GLOUCESTER": Hath she forgot already that brave Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since, Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury? nature, Young, valiant, wise, and no doubt right royal-
FRANCESCO: Down with Cecil!
JONSON: This is what Essex is waiting for Oxford is bringing him a mob.
NASHE: Why would Oxford
JONSON: I don't know, I don't know! But, the Tower Cecil, he already knows. He I I have to warn them! Up with Essex! Essex! Death to
VARIOUS GROUNDLINGS: Up with Essex! Essex! Death to
BACKSTAGE: Shakespeare turns to Burbage.
SHAKESPEARE: We must close the play. Now!!
BURBAGE: Close the.? Are you off your head?
ON STAGE: It's getting unruly.
"GLOUCESTER": ( repeating ) Fram'd. in the prodigality of nature, Young, valiant, wise, and no doubt right royal-
FRANCESCO: To Essex House! To Essex House! Death to Cecil! Traitor!
MAN: To Essex! And then to the Queen! Ess-ex! Ess-ex!
JONSON: is in the middle of the uncontrolled mob. He spots Francesco nearby.
WIDER: The mob has to slow down on the bridge. There is not much room. And then it happens! We are at the front of the mob, when the first soldiers appear and pull down the tarps revealing the cannons. People scream as an Officer appears and
OFFICER: And then the cannon FIRES. There is PANIC all around, runs with the crowd, trying to escape.
JONSON: runs with the crowd, trying to escape.
SOUTHAMPTON: They should be here by now.
ESSEX: We go as we are! Now!!
JONSON: is in the middle of it.
FRANCESCO: Signor Jonson! We are betrayed! Run!
MAIN COURTYARD: Essex rears his horse, looks around at the many windows that surround them from above.
ESSEX: To the Queen! To the Queen!
THE GATE: SLAMS closed. And
POLE: Take your aim!
SOUTHAMPTON: pg. 123
SOUTHAMPTON: It's a trap!
ESSEX: Spread out!
POLE: IN THE COURTYARD AND a hundred shots FIRE down into Essex and his men!
POLE: 142 INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY 142
ROBERT CECIL: Majesty! You must away! Essex is in armed revolt! He's come to usurp you!
ELIZABETH: ( confused ) Essex? I Edward is
ROBERT CECIL: You must flee! Quickly! Majesty! He means to kill you and take your throne for himself!
OXFORD: He wanted his grandson to be an Earl.
ROBERT CECIL: No, Edward. He wanted his grandson to be a king.
OXFORD: You lie.
ROBERT CECIL: Do I? Why do you think he worked so hard to become your guardian after your father died? He had it all planned years in advance. He would teach you everything he knew about statecraft, marry his daughter, and, after Elizabeth's death, proclaim you heir. His own grandchild to follow you on the throne. But he couldn't possibly predict what kind of failure you would become. How you would fail in politics, ignore your estates to the point of bankruptcy, all to write. Or that you would commit incest.
OXFORD: Elizabeth would never have
ROBERT CECIL: What? Slept with her son? I don't think she ever knew, to tell you the truth. Though you never know with the Tudors. They all have had such strange tastes in bed-fellows. You could have been a king, Edward. And your son after you. Except for the fact that. you were you.
ROBERT CECIL: I want a fair trial for Southampton. Evidence, witnesses, no false confessions. It must be above reproach. Though with a guilty verdict of course. Oh, and Pole If there is any mention of that play
ANNE: Sentence has been passed.
ESSEX: stands, looking at life one last time. The Executioner approaches with an axe. Essex turns, realizing it is He kneels, resting his head on a wooden bench.
ESSEX: Strike true.
BOOTS: as they walk, limping along tiled floors. We are:
ELIZABETH: Leave us. All of you.
ROBERT CECIL: Majesty, I
ELIZABETH: Leave us!
OXFORD: I thank your majesty for seeing me.
ELIZABETH: You cannot have him.
OXFORD: He is our son.
ELIZABETH: Who did commit High Treason!
OXFORD: They only wished for a place in government equal to their station. Equal to their birth.
ELIZABETH: You caused this! Your play, your words, caused my people to mob against me! Do you think I wasn't aware of your plot with this man Shakespeare, that I wouldn't recognize your voice? It should be your head on the block next week, not Southampton's!
OXFORD: Then take my head. In our son's
ELIZABETH: Cecil? He has kept me my throne! Mary, Queen of Scots. Philip, King of Spain. Four French Louis's. Eight Popes they all wanted my head. My throne. All of them! Yet here I remain. Because of the We would have protected you
OXFORD: We would have protected you
ELIZABETH: You would have protected me? You? My "loyal" Earls? You think Essex and Southampton were the first to conspire against me, to try to take my throne? No! Only the Cecils could I trust! Commoners! They could never claim my throne. Never! Their wealth, their power, their survival, all depended on me. Me and no other!
OXFORD: Let our child live.
ELIZABETH: ( furious ) All Englishmen are my children!
OXFORD: He will never learn of it from me.
ELIZABETH: He must never know. Never. Take him.
OXFORD: But only after my death! Only then! When all is complete. After James is crowned king, his crown safe, only then can you claim your son. our This Island will be whole.
ELIZABETH: Treason. that is all that has come from you. your son. Your plays. None will be claimed by you. None.
ROBERT CECIL: is watching James. His face betrays his proud feelings. All of Robert Cecil's desires have come true. Oxford's wife Anne is there, but Oxford is nowhere to be seen.
SHAKESPEARE: The line won't get a laugh that way. You must accent the word sirrah
SHAKESPEARE: A command performance for our new king! Even in bloody Scotland they've heard of bloody Will Shakespeare, have they? Fraud. Charlatan. Counterfeiter of wit! Murderer!
JONSON: A command performance for our new king! Even in bloody Scotland they've heard of bloody Will Shakespeare, have they? Fraud. Charlatan. Counterfeiter of wit! Murderer!
SHAKESPEARE: Ben, please.
ANNE: ( to servant ) What is this man doing in my house?
JONSON: It was your husband who sent for me, And I am dismissing you
ANNE: And I am dismissing you
SECOND DOCTOR: Are you Jonson?
JONSON: Excuse me, your grace.
OXFORD: Thank you, doctor.
JONSON: ( almost a whisper ) I find. your words. the most wondrous ever heard on our stage. On any stage. Ever.
OXFORD: Promise me. promise me, Jonson, that you will keep our secret safe. That you won't expose Shakespeare.
JONSON: My lord?
OXFORD: I have seen it in your face. He vexes you. How could he not? But he is not your burden. He is mine.
JONSON: I am not worthy of this charge, my lord. I. I betrayed you. I told them of your
OXFORD: I have made it my life to know the character of men, Jonson. I know you. You may have betrayed me, but you will never betray my words.
FRONT PAGE: Which reads "DEDICATION", then more words, starting "To the Earl of Southampton"
ANNE: Get out! You, your friends, your blasphemous theaters, have brought nothing but ruin and dishonor to this Ruin? Dishonor? Madam. You, your family, me, even Elizabeth herself shall be remembered solely because we had the honor to live whilst your husband put ink to paper.
JONSON: Ruin? Dishonor? Madam. You, your family, me, even Elizabeth herself shall be remembered solely because we had the honor to live whilst your husband put ink to paper.
CECIL: I can make all this go away, Jonson. To be but a dream. Like one of your plays. Or, I can bring you so much pain pain that were you given a thousand years, and a thousand quills, you could never justly describe.
JONSON: They were destroyed. burned. by your own men.
INTERROGATOR: He's lying.
JONSON: My lord? Why would I lie? Is there a man alive who has reason to hate him more than I?
CECIL: Let him go! He tells the truth. And Jonson better him, won't you? Wipe his memory for all time. For you. And for me.
JONSON: ( sotto ) I am afraid that this is not possible, my lord.
JONSON: opens the box.
AN ACTOR: playing Prologue. He is the same actor who introduced the "play" at the beginning of the film. But now he wears Elizabethan clothing but again, all monochromatic and grey.
PROLOGUE: Let us, ciphers to this great accompt, on your imaginary forces work.
JAMES I: We had seen some of this Shakespeare's plays in Edinburgh, Sir Robert. I must tell you, we enjoyed them immensely, and look forward to seeing many more, now that we are in London. I presume you are as avid a theater man as myself?
ROBERT CECIL: Of course, your majesty.
PROLOGUE: Robert Cecil remained the most powerful man in the Court of King James, though he could not prevent the public theaters from becoming ever more popular. William Shakespeare, however, spent the remaining years of his life not in the playhouses of London, but in the small town of his birth, Stratford upon Avon, as a businessman and grain merchant.
