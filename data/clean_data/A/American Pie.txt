KEVIN: Indeed I did. But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot. It's time for us to.express ourselves in new ways.

VICKY: But you don't love me.
KEVIN: I didn't say that. I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what? It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."

JESSICA: Thanks. It was my idea.
KEVIN: Did you guys hook up or something?
JESSICA: Are you kidding? No.
KEVIN: Then what the hell are you talking Well.I guess it's okay for me to tell you now. That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera." So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed. So he did, and I did.
JESSICA: Well.I guess it's okay for me to tell you now. That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."

OZ: Our last game is this Saturday.
STIFLER: No shit.
OZ: .I've got this lacrosse game. It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by.
HEATHER: ( pause ) You can't sing at the competition.
OZ: I'm sorry, I totally spaced. I just.I didn't realize it.
HEATHER: ( upset but trying to be cool ) .it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.

ALBERT: No problemo.
COACH MARSHALL: Alright! Good hustle, guys, but we can still lose. You all saw what happened to Oz out there. I don't ever want to see you guys thinking you're gonna score. You don't score until you score, period.
ALBERT: Focus on the music. Think melody. Let the music be my guide.
HEATHER: That would be a start.
COACH MARSHALL: It all boils down to today. For you seniors, this marks the culmination of your past four years. Think of what that means to you. Are you guys gonna look back on your days at East and know that you made the most of the time you had? Now that's the attitude, Ostreicher!
OZ: Good luck, guys.
COACH MARSHALL: Christ! I didn't say you were out of the game!
OZ: Sorry, coach.
