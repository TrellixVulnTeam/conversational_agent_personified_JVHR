SARA: Nico, will you let the woman catch her breath?
NICO: Watanabe! Say hey, Doc. They begin jabbering in Japanese. We will meet Watanabe again later. She's a brainy-looking woman reserved, a bit mysterious who talks quietly and intensely in Japanese with Nico like they're old friends who go back a long way.
BRANCA: You're a father now. Are you gonna take me up on my offer?
NICO: I'm happy, Branca. I like what I do. Branca glances seriously to the other uncles, then, with a smile, pats Nico's cheek.
BRANCA: Look at this face! Six-foot-four, pretty as the statue of David. And he's a cop! Branca laughs. From a distance, Watanabe watches, missing nothing. Across the porch, Lukich and several other cops observe and try to listen.
BRANCA: This face should be sticking up from a white shirt. It should be a banker, a businessman, someone who earns a decent living for his family!
NICO: We're happy.
LUIGI: Nickels and dimes. Your wife's a woman with class. What did she run a ballet school.?
NICO: An art gallery.
BRANCA: Same thing. She wants a husband who carries a briefcase, not a shoulder Jackson watches Nico trying to keep his good humor. This is serious stuff, despite the light tone. Branca's eyes meet Nico's.
BRANCA: You wanted to get shot, you got shot. You wanted to get knifed, you got knifed. You've had your fun. Basta! Let your family help you, Nico.
UNCLE GUISEPPE: Let your family help you, Nico.

NICO: I gotta take a quick leak. Stay
BAD DUDE: Why the fuck don't you assholes leave me alone? He continues mouthing off to Nico. Nico moves to one stool, then another; the same exchange is repeated.
NICO: One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins to pick his nose.
NICO: You seen this girl?
NICO: That's witty.
NICO: Come on. Show me something.

LUCY: Let him alone! He's beautiful!
NICO: Not when I get through with him.
PIMP: No, man, wait! I'll give you something! Something big!
LUCY: Please, Nico! Don't!
PIMP: It's huge! I swear it! A shipment. coming in next Shipment, my ass.

JACKSON: You're one crazy bastard, Toscani.
NICO: We'll get her some clothes and a bath. I'm not bringing her home to her grandmother like this.
JACKSON: I don't get you, Toscani. What the hell are you doing being a shitheel cop? With your background?
NICO: When I was overseas, I saw some things. Things that eat your guts out. Things that stay in front of your eyes like they were burned in and branded.
NICO: You can walk away from them, Jax. You can quit, but you know it's still going on. You try something I know I'm not going to change the world. I can't stop the tonnage coming in, I can't fight the boys behind the desks pushing their But maybe here, huh?

NICO: Carla. Carla I just want the name of your boyfriend
CARLA: I got 200 boyfriends. The hooker, Carla DeCarlo, slaps the box away, cursing in Pinchi cabron, cabeza colon!
CARLA: Pinchi cabron, cabeza colon!

NICO: ( walking away ) Take it easy, sister.
JACKSON: I ain't your goddamn sister. We ain't got the same mother,
JACKSON: The lawyer's name is Abandano. He's on the third floor. I got a look at him. I couldn't get how he's connected, but according to Carla, he's a lousy lay.
NICO: Maybe we can bust him for that.
JACKSON: That's our stud.
SALVANO: ( pissed off ) I brought you in for your muscles, Nardo, not your mouth.
NARDO: ( scared ) I'm sorry, boss.
SALVANO: Your English is getting good. You're showing it off. Showing it off on the street
NARDO: I keep quiet. I never talk no Salvano glowers at Nardo like he's about to punch him. Instead he reaches over, playfully chokes the busboy then releases him, as if all is forgiven.
SALVANO: Make yourself useful. Get downstairs, bring me one of Then get back to work.
NARDO: ( to himself ) I thought I was dead, man. ( whistles with I thought I was fucking dead.

SALVANO: ( to busboys ) Clean up this mess.
CHI CHI: Who knows who else is talking
SALVANO: He was a young fool.
CHI CHI: We're crazy waiting for this bullshit 'shipment.' Let me waste the other fucker now. Salvano puts a hand on Chi Chi's shoulder.
SALVANO: Be patient. This will be done the way it was planned.
JACKSON: Toscani, you're going to have me doing time.
NICO: Lighten up, Jax. No one's bringing this into court.
JACKSON: Except against us.
NICO: I don't give a shit how we do it. I just wanna get there.

SALVANO: You see what he did to me?!
AGENT HALLORAN: Your problem is being handled right now, Mr. Salv
SALVANO: Yeah? Well, it shoulda been handled twelve hours ago. I don't know who's running this outfit, but somebody better get his goddamn wires yes, sir. yes, sir, I understand
AGENT NEELEY: ( into phone ) yes, sir. yes, sir, I understand
SALVANO: That maniac should be wearing a number, not a badge.
AGENT NEELEY: ( into phone ) count on it, sir. Right. You'll have our full cooperation.
AGENT NEELEY: You're free to go.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: ( to Nico, DEA This is no reflection on the work you officers have done. I feel, and the whole department feels, extremely proud of your initiative and gallantry.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: As all of you are well aware, possession of these explosives is a federal offense and under jurisdiction of the F.B.I.
NICO: Sir. With all respect to our brothers in the Bureau That's no answer. It's no answer to why one of the biggest dealers in the city is out on the street now, free as a bird!
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: Keep it in your pants, Nico. These men have a job to do, just like us.
AGENT NEELEY: Lieutenant, I think these officers are entitled to a fuller
AGENT NEELEY: What I'm about to say doesn't leave this room. Is that clear?
AGENT NEELEY: Mr. Salvano has been working for some time in cooperation with certain federal agencies.
AGENT NEELEY: Mr. Salvano's role is crucial to an extremely sensitive ongoing investigation. Any further surveillance, harassment, or unauthorized operations against this individual are forbidden. I must order you gentlemen with all respect for your work and your courage, to stand down.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: The tapes too.
NICO: ( mocking ) That's my Lawrence Welk I want everything you got on this
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: I want everything you got on this Reluctantly, Nico hands over the tapes. The Lieutenant eyes the bugs and wires.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: I know you don't give a shit about yourself, Toscani. But you're gonna put Jackson's ass in a sling, too, with these illegal wires.
AGENT HALLORAN: What's the story on your partner, Jackson? Did he learn this style or was he born with a brick up his Jackson checks Halloran out. He's black too and, despite herself, there's a certain rapport.
JACKSON: He has ethics. Unlike certain others on this case. Halloran watches the illegal bugs and tapes come out of Nico's drawer.
AGENT HALLORAN: His 'ethics' are gonna cost him his badge and his gun. This "white" talk gives Jackson a pain. She slips into her jive mode.
JACKSON: You don't wanna catch him without no gun. Halloran's look asks why not?
JACKSON: 'Cause what he do with his hands. make bullet holes look pretty. Across the room, Nico turns over the tapes.
AGENT HALLORAN: He bad?
JACKSON: Bad bad.
JACKSON: Is that enough? Can we do something normal now like eat lunch?
NICO: Anything you say, Jax. How about Salvano's?
JACKSON: Let it be, Nico.
JACKSON: What. you kept his tape, too?
NICO: Poetry, ain't it?
JACKSON: This is your mother's church, isn't it?
NICO: Yeah. But I bet she's never seen these boys in the choir.
NICO: Father Genarro. The priest seizes Nico's hand warmly, smiles at Jackson.
FATHER GENARRO: This must be your partner in I'm Father Genarro. I saw you at the baptismal party. What a partner.
JACKSON: Dolores Jackson Nico, we gotta go
FATHER GENARRO: No, please It's good you stopped by. I have to show you something. Please. The priest begins leading Nico and Jackson. Jackson keeps glancing back out the alley to see Salvano's car slowly driving by.
FATHER GENARRO: The rats are getting bigger.
NICO: When did this happen?
FATHER GENARRO: Two nights ago. I didn't call the police.
FATHER GENARRO: ( in Spanish ) It's all right, son. These are
FATHER GENARRO: ( referring to the cops ) These are friends. ( to Nico ) This is Father Tomassino.
FATHER TOMASSINO: How do you do? Nico shakes the young priest's hand. There is a moment between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave.
JACKSON: I didn't know this church was a sanctuary, Father.
FATHER GENARRO: Yes. But, perhaps not such a safe one.
NICO: How long have they been here?
FATHER GENARRO: Too long. At least the kids can go to our school.
NICO: Who did it, Father?
FATHER GENARRO: Kids, maybe. Maybe worse. It's not the first We can have a car check by, every No. please. Police frighten these people.
JACKSON: We can have a car check by, every No. please. Police frighten these people.
FATHER GENARRO: No. please. Police frighten these people.
NICO: Really, I don't mind coming by.
FATHER GENARRO: Tell me, Nico. When was your last confession?
NICO: I'm a married man, Father. I've got no sins to confess.
FATHER GENARRO: You're a police officer, you have many sins to confess.
JACKSON: Nico and Jackson start off.
FATHER GENARRO: ( calls after Nico ) You come back Sunday. I feel better when I see Nicola in ( calls louder ) You don't show, I'm phoning your

NICO: You. That's what the hell it is!
AGENT NEELEY: Get your goddam hands off me!
NICO: You let Salvano walk.
AGENT NEELEY: Salvano?! Are you crazy? What does he have to do with this?
NICO: That was no cherry bomb in there. That was C-fucking-4! I've used that shit.
AGENT NEELEY: Salvano never came near that C-4. It's in federal holding now! Besides, why would he blow up a I tailed Salvano. Two days ago. Him and one of his apes were in that church and they weren't taking communion. I saw some broad saw who was with his lawyer plant the bomb. Now I want some goddamn You tailed him?

AGENT NEELEY: You tailed him? After I ordered you off?
NICO: Where is he? Where's Salvano?
AGENT NEELEY: My orders were release him. Not babysit him. Neeley brushes Nico's fingermarks off his lapels.
AGENT NEELEY: You think you're rough stuff, Toscani martial arts hero, chop suey crap. Well I'll tell you something: you're not bullet- proof. You're not even a good You sneak around, playing your street dick games. But all you come up with is conjecture, wild coincidence and bullshit.
NICO: I want the agent who signed for the explosives.
AGENT NEELEY: I'll do my job. You do yours.

MAID: You gonna be in real trouble, mister, when El Senor Salvano find out about dis.

NICO: I'm willing to break the rules; I'm willing to tell you whatever I know. But I need some time. Could you just give me some time?
SARA: I'll bet that's her.
NICO: ( into phone ) This better be good, Jax.
NICO: ( into phone ) Long time, Nelson.
FOX: You should know not to use a name on an open line. I'm gonna talk for fifteen seconds, then I'm getting off. You're in trouble, Nico.
FOX: You hear me? Now. I'm risking my ass by telling you this. Good luck, kid.
SARA: ( grim ) That was Fox, wasn't it?
SARA: ( very concerned ) Why is the C.I.A. calling you at two in the morning?
NICO: It's okay, sweetheart You know what a crazy bastard Fox is. He gets drunk and forgets he's halfway around the world. He calls me.

NICO: Where's Jackson?
CROWDER: She's outa this.
AGENT HALLORAN: You're the rotten apple in this barrel, Toscani. We don't have to look any farther than you and your 'family.' Nico comes out of his chair, going for Halloran. Strozah tries to block him, but it's useless.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: Nico! You damn fool! You wanna go to prison?! Nico stops. He's speechless with rage. His finger points toward Halloran like a loaded gun.
CROWDER: ( indicates more Unlawful entry. Illegal search and seizure

LIEUTENANT STROZAH: You're officially suspended, Toscani. I want your tin. and your iron. Neeley leans past Nico; drops Nico's gun ( with an evidence tag on it ) onto the table. Nico looks to Strozah, who averts his eyes. Nico flips his badge onto the table.
NICO: You holding me?
AGENT NEELEY: You can walk for now. But don't walk far.
NICO: Sara, I'm okay. I love you.
SARA: Where are you? Why aren't you coming home?
NICO: I'll be home later. Lukich will be there. Tell mama not to worry.
JACKSON: I found the sanctuary people.

NICO: Hands on the counter! Three men do it; the fourth is slow.
NICO: Don't tempt me, ASSHOLE The fourth obeys. Nico moves to the pay phone on the wall, covering the men with his .45. He grabs the re- ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. Adrenaline makes his hand shake; the dials spin wrong One of the men sees Nico's dilemma. To hit 911, Nico has to take his eye momentarily off his captives. As Nico turns again to the dial A free-standing sales display hurtles toward him, crashing into his gun hand. One of the men has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a second later. The whole human pile crashes, thundering into a glass freezer. Somehow Nico gets to his feet. One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the freezer doors Wham! smack into the man's face. The GLASS SHATTERS; the man drops like a rock. Now it's three against one prime odds for Nico. He wades into his attackers. A coffee stand goes flying. A body sails into a makeup display. One fool is lucky enough to land a blow that bloodies Nico's nose; he pays with a shattered forearm and a head-first heave into an ice cream locker

SARA: ( no longer angry ) Mama. you got your medicine? Don't forget the baby's sweater
ROSA: I know about babies. We glimpse other relatives in the hallway; Nico hands them a pair of suitcases; they hurry off

AGENT NEELEY: ( into mike ) Thank you. That's what I wanted.

NICO: So you think I'm a lousy cop, huh, Neeley? Maybe I am. But I haven't got my face buried up Washington's ass.
AGENT NEELEY: Nobody buys me, Toscani.
NICO: Yeah? Then somebody pulled the plug on your brain, pal. You didn't come up with the second priest, did you? Or Harrison's dead aide. Hurry up! You heard the radio. The Agency's pushing buttons and bodies are dropping like flies. You assholes are missing half the case!

WATANABE: So good to see you again, sir! Come back near closing. five- thirty. we'll place your order Nico nods, fades like a shadow into the throng. MUSIC
WATANABE: emerges with Nico from behind a booth divider, leads her old friend at a brisk pace across the deserted floor.
NICO: Listen, Wat. you know I wouldn't call in a favor
WATANABE: Of course not. Just because you kept a few 'friendly' tribesmen from cutting my heart out and serving it up as Pad Thai?
WATANABE: The last six years I've been risking nothing but money. It's a kick to risk my ass again.
NICO: The old Spook.
JACKSON: ( into phone )
JACKSON: ( into phone ) Yes. yes, of course, sister, I know who you are. ( listens ) where. where are you?
WATANABE: No way to access Covert Ops directly. But Ornstein's at Princeton, he's got a database bigger than Langley If I can't crack that turkey's code, it's time to hang up my rock and roll shoes
WATANABE: ah, here! Here's a little trap door. Let's see if we can wriggle up Personnel files! Operative dossiers. Will that do?
NICO: It's a start.

WATANABE: I can get you the ball scores, too.
NICO: Five agents from Central American desk. All trained assassins. All arrived in Chicago in the last week and none of them has left.
NICO: Thanks, Wat. You finally may have done some good for your country.
WATANABE: Where are you going?
NICO: To find a priest.
NICO: How did ya find him?
JACKSON: The nun phoned me. She said two men had been sneaking around the church. She sounded scared
JACKSON: There's more. I got the papers from that senator's aide's apartment. Everything Harrison's been working on. It's all at my place.
ZAGON: You'll be in heaven in a few minutes, padre. But first I'm going to put you through hell.
ZAGON: You came here to talk to the Senator's aide, didn't you?
FATHER TOMASSINO: I tried. But you killed him first.
ZAGON: Who told you about our plans?
FATHER TOMASSINO: This is from confession. I tell no You wouldn't lie to me, Father? It's a sin.
ZAGON: You wouldn't lie to me, Father? It's a sin.
ZAGON: ( almost with kindness ) If you spoke to anyone, tell me now ( indicates hypo ) and I won't have to use this.
NICO: You're our backup. If we come out running, then you can shoot.
ZAGON: Speak to me, Father who did you tell?
FATHER TOMASSINO: I know what you are. I know what beasts you are.
ZAGON: I want to know who you told.
FATHER TOMASSINO: ( barely coherent ) I told them. you make the ninos. see. castrating their fathers raping. mutilating their mothers . And. ( breaks down crying ) . and sometimes. to the ninos.
ZAGON: ( close to priest ) Can we kill him? If you told anyone, about our plans to kill the senator, we cannot do it.
FATHER TOMASSINO: Nadie. Nadie. Nadie.
NICO: Go! Go!
ZAGON: ( in Spanish, from Get him! Finish him!
ZAGON: Nico bolts for the stairwell to the roof, clawing for a new clip as he goes. Salvano and Zagon burst into the hallway, SHOOTING at Nico.
NICO: ( to Jackson's photo ) Had to be a hero. another fucking hero. I'm sorry Jax.
NICO: ( of papers, with scorn ) dumb fuck. think they're gonna let you put 'em outta business
JACKSON: ( to Lukich ) You call Nico's goddamn Uncle and find out if he's heard anything.
LUKICH: ( wounded himself ) You just shutup and take it easy,
LUKICH: ( on phone ) We don't know what happened to him, Branca. Ya, she's gonna be alright.
BRANCA: Jesus Christ!
NICO: The motherfuckas got Jackson.
BRANCA: Lukich called. She's not dead. She's gonna make it. She was wearing a vest.
NICO: That broad didn't trust me.
BRANCA: It was picked up with your mail this
BRANCA: Don't worry, they're booked on an early plane. They'll be out of the country
SARA: Oh my God, Nico!
BRANCA: He's fine. The boy has ribs of steel!
ROSA: ( touching Nico's brow ) Enough of your humor.
BRANCA: ( to doctor and Leave them. Leave them alone.
SARA: You've got to do it, Nico. You know you have to.
ROSA: Listen to her, Nicola. Whatever you think of him, Federico is family. He is our family.
NICO: Ever notice how clean babies smell? Like nothing in the world has touched them yet.
SARA: If you won't go to him, I will.
NICO: ( in pain ) Don't push me like this
SARA: Branca can put us on a plane but where can we fly to? Tibet? The moon? There's nowhere they can't find us.
NICO: You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
SARA: I'm talking about everything I've learned from you in the past five
NICO: You know I can't go to him.
SARA: Do you know why I love you? Do you know what it is about you that I've always loved? Pride. It's what you have inside. You don't live the way other people live. You trust what you see as right and won't let anyone or anything make you stray from it.
FREDERICO LARUSSO: I am only an old man. An old man with a cancer.
NICO: I don't have much time, Uncle. So I must speak plainly.
NICO: ( this is very painful For as long as I've been old enough to think, I've hated you and hated everything you stood for.
NICO: I was so sure that you and I were on opposite sides of the fence. and that you and your people were destroying this country
NICO: The most painful realization of my life was that the people I worked for and you are not far apart. And there's not much difference between what you are and what I was.
FREDERICO LARUSSO: I will be candid with you. I knew, probably before you did, that you would be coming to me. I knew what you would ask. and I had every intention of refusing you.
FREDERICO LARUSSO: But it is a form of wisdom to know when to cease relying only upon
FREDERICO LARUSSO: You know, of course, that this Senator Harrison will never live to make his speech tomorrow. You know, too, that as long as this man. this torturer
NICO: Kurt Zagon.
FREDERICO LARUSSO: As long as this Zagon lives, nothing I can do will guarantee your family's 'Ecce non uomine, ecce bestie.' You know Dante? 'These are not men, these are animals.'
FREDERICO LARUSSO: Memorize this address.
FREDERICO LARUSSO: Have you got it in your mind?
FREDERICO LARUSSO: Thank you, Mr. Carlucci. I trust you will give my love to my niece, Rosa.
NICO: I will do that, Mr. Larusso. I hope you will be well.
BRANCA: You got the architect's drawings? Wiring, floor plans
NICO: It's all here.
BRANCA: I could help you from here on.
NICO: It's not your business.
NICO: Grazie, tio caro.
BRANCA: Take care of yourself, Nicola.
NICO: That wasn't the plan, Nelson.
FOX: Close range, huh? Never work. Place is rigged, scanned every 35 seconds.
NICO: ( back still turned ) I was thinking of a mine on the roof. Remote-triggered, when the chopper comes in.
FOX: Roof's wired too. Sensors every fifteen feet.
FOX: You can turn now. Slowly. Slooowly.
FOX: I figured you'd do your recon from this
NICO: You're looking fit, Nelson.
FOX: Getting a bit of a tire.
NICO: ( indicates Fox's suit ) Your own tailor?
FOX: Hong Kong.
NICO: You've gone a long way.
FOX: Uh uh. Uhhh-uh. I know what you can do when you get too close to a man.
NICO: I don't believe you, Fox.
FOX: What's so hard to believe. I want to help you, you dumb guinea!
NICO: Fox the fixer.
FOX: If I wanted to cap you, I'd have saved myself this chit-chat. Make big points for me to bring in your scalp. I'd be White House material.
NICO: Is that what Zagon is? One of your basement boys?
FOX: Zagon's a rancher. 4000 acres in Costa Rica. Beautiful place.
NICO: Bought with what opium from Cambodia?
FOX: And a ton a week of coke from other Which he funnels here through Salvano. With the Company getting its cut.
NICO: Which he funnels here through Salvano. With the Company getting its cut.
FOX: Legal tender.
NICO: Still dodging appropriations committees, eh, Nelson?
FOX: That's my job, Nico.
FOX: Keep your nose in the corner. When we get out, stay five paces ahead of me. Cross down to the garage.
NICO: The Senator couldn't be bought, could he? He was gonna blow the lid off, so you cleared Zagon to frost him
FOX: Keep walking.
NICO: ran here. You couldn't do the Senator's number 'till you knew if the priest had talked. So Zagon flew in with his little medical bag. Only by then I was in on it and you thought I might recognize his handiwork.
FOX: If your name was Joe Smith I never would have caught it. But how many Nicola Toscani's are there?
NICO: You got it off the arrest sheet. Fox hands his ticket to the cashier, motions Nico to the side, away from the guests, still keeping his distance should Nico try to make a move.
FOX: I tried to warn you, old buddy. I knew you had wiretaps. and I knew you wouldn't let 'em go.
NICO: Only I was too dumb to crack it. I was so busy trying to figure a code, I didn't even recognize Zagon's voice. It's all crystal clear to Nico now.
NICO: So we kill our own senators now.
FOX: Why not? The Romans did. A Cadillac pulls up; the valet hops out, two particularly florid, well-fed guests get in, tipping the valet.
NICO: ( to Fox, watching the Are we the Romans?
FOX: We're an empire too. Fox doesn't like the look Nico gives him.
FOX: Would you rather spoon borscht and quote Lenin? I'm trying to save you, asshole! I got a spot for you. Thailand, deep under, no names, no numbers
NICO: Doing what processing heroin?
FOX: You 'consult.' You 'assist.' You send checks to your family. Zagon won't touch you, you'll be on the team
NICO: Fuck you.
FOX: In five years you're out, with a fat Swiss account and a GS-15 pension. Nico stares at his old friend with contempt. He sees the gun under Fox's coat, but he's too tired and too disgusted to care
NICO: You know, Fox, right now in Israel they're trying some 80-year-old camp guard for war crimes. And all around our country there are guys on Death Row for killing one person, two people. And probably they all deserve it He takes a step toward Fox. Fox's hand tightens on his gun.
NICO: ( emotion rising ) but you and I know a couple guys personally who are responsible for the murder of at least what. 60,000 non- military personnel. ( ticks off the beats ) Viet. Lao. Thai. Cambodian. Librarians, teachers, doctors. women, children. and that's just a sliver of
NICO: ( presses closer ) We've wiped out entire fucking countries. And not one agent
FOX: ( moves gun into Nico's Stop right there!
NICO: ( doesn't stop ) not one C.I.A. agent has ever been tried or convicted, much less accused of any crimes. ( closer still ) You motherfuckers think you're above the law ( right in Fox's face ) Well, you ain't above mine.
NICO: Well. well. What a team we have We've been looking for you, Nelson. I see you've found our friend.
ZAGON: ( calls, friendly ) We've been looking for you, Nelson. I see you've found our friend.
NICO: Thanks for the help, Fox.
FOX: I didn't bring him, Nico. I swear it!
ZAGON: Have you two been sharing fond memories? Reminiscing about the good old days?
FOX: Stay still! Don't fucking move!! Fox pulls his .45 from concealment, covering Nico. An EVENING-GOWNED WOMAN, waiting with her husband for their car, hears Fox's shout, sees his gun.
ZAGON: Bring in our friend, Nelson.
ZAGON: Be a good boy
FOX: Dive, Nico!!
ZAGON: ( to first agent,
STEAM: 378 ZAGON
ZAGON: No! I want him! I want him alive!
ZAGON: We've got an hour before the honorable senator. You've got to learn to take time, smell the roses. Zagon turns to Nico.
NICO: How are you gonna do him, Zagon? In a motorcade? Or passing through a hotel kitchen? The Noose agent jerks his cable tight, making Nico gag and choke. Zagon motions to slacken off. He stops at a small table before Nico unrolls a well-worn felt pouch. Zagon watches Nico's reaction as the tools of the inter- rogator's trade come into view drug vials, syringes, scalpels, surgical tools.
ZAGON: I've used these little beauties many times to extract information This'll be the first time I've ever used them. just for fun. Zagon sets the syringe down, slips on a heavy, weighted Take his arms. Pistol agent and Bad Dude move in, one on each side, seizing Nico's forearms. Shotgun agent holds his weapon tight to Nico's head.
ZAGON: ( to agents ) Take his arms.
ZAGON: Hold him up! Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico. Zagon slams him again. Again. Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains from his nose. Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands Nico, crushing the other side of his face! Zagon backs off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico looks like the Viet prisoner the one we saw in the opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his beating still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes with defiance.
ZAGON: This is where you came in, Toscani. Only, now it's where you're gonna check out. He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe. Pistol agent and Bad Dude clamp Nico's right arm down tight. Zagon injects Nico.
ZAGON: That's it. Fight it, cherry. Fight it, so it speeds faster on its way Nico struggles more violently.
ZAGON: Fight it. Till the vessels burst in your brain. Till the arteries rupture in your heart Slowly, the struggle goes out of Nico. His muscles go limp; he slumps drooling, babbling incoherently.
ZAGON: That's my boy. That's what I was waiting for Zagon produces his famous knife. He motions Pistol agent and Bad Dude to release Nico's arms. Noose agent slackens his grip on the choke cable. Zagon moves in closer, gloating, cooing
ZAGON: A fool learns from his own mistakes. But a wise man learns from the mistakes of others You should have killed me when you had the chance, Toscani
ZAGON: Can you feel the chemicals, cherry? You can't fight 'em much Long enough to finish you.
NICO: Long enough to finish you.
LUKICH: ( shouting for Is there a hotel doctor? Call 911!
SENATOR HARRISON: Detective Toscani. I wanted to personally thank you. You are making it possible for a sliver of truth to finally come out.
SENATOR HARRISON: And this is Clayton Alspaugh of the fifth circuit court.
NICO: Your Honor.
JUDGE ALSPAUGH: Are you sure you're feeling well
NICO: ( to Alspaugh ) If you're ready to listen, I'm ready to talk.
