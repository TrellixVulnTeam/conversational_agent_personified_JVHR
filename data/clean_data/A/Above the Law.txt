ABOVE THE LAW: Screenplay by STEVEN PRESSFIELD and RONALD SHUSETT and ANDREW DAVIS Story by ANDREW DAVIS and STEVEN SEAGAL
FOX: You ever see chemical interrogation before?
NICO: These assholes are agency?
ZAGON: How long till we're across the border?
NICO: We've been over for the past hour.
ZAGON: What are you looking at, hotshot?
NICO: (indicates cigarette glow) Why don't you light a bonfire?
ZAGON: Just drive the taxi, ace.
FOX: (to Zagon) They're in there.
NICO: I don't trust these yo-yo's.
ZAGON: That's the nice thing about modern technology. You don't have to wait for results.
ZAGON: (to first prisoner) Where is it, Charley? You got six tons of our shit --
ZAGON: Don't you die on me, fucker --
FOX: (from the side) What the hell's wrong?
ZAGON: (throws the prisoner down) This pussy can't hold his liquor.
ZAGON: (to second prisoner) So my little doctor bag doesn't scare you, eh? Well I don't need it to open your yap.
ZAGON (O.S.): (to prisoner) Where's our load, you sack of slime? What did you do with my shit? --
ZAGON: I'm gonna teach you good. I'm gonna teach you never to fuck with my opium --
ZAGON: (to prisoner)
FOX: (to Nico)
ZAGON: (to second prisoner)
NICO: (can't take much more)
ZAGON: You can disappear as easy as this slope, kid --
FOX: Are you crazy?!! (as Nico jerks free) What the fuck's the matter with you?!!!
FOX: Nico!
NICO: I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me later.
FOX: I'll cover this. Get back to the
L.Z. --: (as Nico resists) -- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the fuck outa here!
FOX: (to Nico) I'll call for a chopper... get outa here!
SARA: Mama, look at this -- all done by hand.
ROSA: Nico had one just like this.   Thank you, Cora.
NICO: I think we got a little problem here.
SARA: (winking at the women) I carried him for the last nine months, you take him for the next diaper.
NICO: (to all) That's what you get for not marrying a Sicilian.
SARA: My brave husband. He's not afraid of thieves and muggers, but he's terrified when his son poops in his pants.
LUKICH: (indicates Nico across the patio) Toscani holds the record... for havin' more relatives under federal indictment than any other cop in Chicago.
BRANCA: Look at these stiff dicks. A free meal and they come out like flies.
STROZAH: I didn't do nothing, Counselor.    I'm clean.
JACKSON: Eight more days, Lieutenant. You better start preparing your defense.
HENDERSON: Baby, I'm gonna put you on retainer.
LUKICH: You passed the bar? I make it a point never to pass the bar.
LUIGI: Now this cop.    She can bust me any day.
JACKSON: Look at this little bundle.    What a cupcake!
NICO: You give up being the D.A. and hurry up and find the right fella, Jax. You might have time for one of these yourself.
SARA: Nico, will you let the woman catch her breath?
NICO: Watanabe!   Say hey, Doc.
BRANCA: You're a father now. Are you gonna take me up on my offer?
NICO: I'm happy, Branca.    I like what I do.
BRANCA: Look at this face! Six-foot-four, pretty as the statue of David. And he's a cop!
BRANCA: This face should be sticking up from a white shirt. It should be a banker, a businessman, someone who earns a decent living for his family!
NICO: We're happy.
LUIGI: Nickels and dimes. Your wife's a woman with class. What did she run -- a ballet school...?
NICO: An art gallery.
BRANCA: Same thing. She wants a husband who carries a briefcase, not a shoulder holster.
BRANCA: You wanted to get shot, you got shot. You wanted to get knifed, you got knifed. You've had your fun. Basta! Enough!
UNCLE GUISEPPE: Let your family help you, Nico.
NICO: (lightly) Uncle Gio, that kind of help I don't need. I'd rather get shot by someone I don't know.
NICO: What are you doing in here, Mama? Go join the party...
NICO: Mrs. Z. (tries to be light) Is this a way to act on the day of my son's baptism?
SARA: It's Lucy.   She's gone again.
NICO: It's that kid from the bar on Damen? The one with the drugs?
NICO: Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you listening? (as the woman nods miserably) I have to go to work now. But I'll come by tonight. You'll be at the bakery?
MRS. ZINGARO: Si, Nico.
NICO: We'll talk, okay? We'll find a way to take care of this.
JACKSON: (into mike) Unit Ten Tango X-ray.    We're up and clear.
NICO (O.S.): I promised the Lieutenant, I'm gonna take care of you. Broken windows and lost kittens for your last week.
JACKSON: And then you're gonna come visit me in a nice, clean, air conditioned office --
NICO: I gotta take a quick leak. Stay put.
BAD DUDE: Why the fuck don't you assholes leave me alone?
NICO: Gentlemen.
FIRST ARMY JACKET: (to others) I thought this was a kosher bar. They didn't allow no pork in here.
NICO: You seen this girl?
SECOND ARMY JACKET: I seen the top of her head.
NICO: That's witty.
NICO: Come on.   Show me something.
NICO: I get it.   It's a gay bar.   Is that it?
NICO: You seen the top of her head, huh? Like I seen your mother's -- (to another guy) Or was it yours? (to a third) Or yours? (slaps him fero- ciously) I couldn't tell, it looked like her ass --
NICO: Come on, motherfuckers.    Do it. Do it! One man --
BAD DUDE: Upstairs! (in terror) She's upstairs! 4-D!
NICO: You cocksuckers are brave enough with 14-year-old girls.
NICO: (to Bad Dude) Get outta here.
NICO: (to Pimp) This ain't your day, kid.
PIMP: Wait, man.   It ain't like it looks --
NICO: That's two years.
NICO: That's four. (twisting the   Pimp's neck toward   Lucy) She'll get you eight   more. And I'm just warming up   --
PIMP: (to Nico, indicat- ing drugs) Take it, baby. It's all yours --
NICO: Get your clothes on, Lucy.
PIMP: There's money. Three grand in the mattress... (begging) ... I can get ya more --
STUD: Hey, sister, what it be?
LUCY: Let him alone! He's beautiful!
NICO: Not when I get through with him.
PIMP: No, man, wait! I'll give you something! Something big!
LUCY: Please, Nico!    Don't!
PIMP: It's huge! I swear it! A shipment... coming in next Tuesday --
NICO: Shipment, my ass.
PIMP: This is square! On my mother's soul! You can't send me up --
PIMP: I heard it from a hooker friend of mine. She's banging some big coke lawyer, he told her. I swear to Jesus!
NICO: What lawyer?
PIMP: I don't know. (sees Nico doesn't believe him) That platinum chola... Carla DeCarlo... she knows.
PIMP: She got popped this afternoon. She's downtown. Red dress, lizard shoes --
JACKSON: It's okay, girl. Mama Jax is here.
JACKSON: (to Nico) That was some leak you took.
JACKSON: Broken windows and lost pussy cats, huh.
JACKSON: You're one crazy bastard, Toscani.
NICO: We'll get her some clothes and a bath. I'm not bringing her home to her grandmother like this.
JACKSON: I don't get you, Toscani. (beat) What the hell are you doing being a shitheel cop? With your background?
NICO: When I was overseas, I saw some things. Things that eat your guts out. Things that stay in front of your eyes like they were burned in and branded.
NICO: You can walk away from them, Jax. You can quit, but you know it's still going on. You try something anyway -- (smiles a moment) -- I know I'm not going to change the world. I can't stop the tonnage coming in, I can't fight the boys behind the desks pushing their buttons --
NICO: That's why I'm a shitheel cop.
COP (O.S.): You can see your client. As soon as she's through eating her dinner.
NICO: Carla... Carla -- I just want the name of your boyfriend --
CARLA: I got 200 boyfriends.
CARLA: Pinchi cabron, cabeza colon!
JACKSON: (to Nico) Why can't you sons-a-bitches ever treat someone with a little respect?
NICO: (walking away) Take it easy, sister.
JACKSON: I ain't your goddamn sister.   We ain't got the same mother, motherfucka.
JACKSON: The lawyer's name is Abandano. He's on the third floor. I got a look at him. I couldn't get how he's connected, but according to Carla, he's a lousy lay.
NICO: Maybe we can bust him for that.
JACKSON: That's our stud.
SALVANO: (pissed off) -- I brought you in for your muscles, Nardo, not your mouth.
NARDO: (scared) I'm sorry, boss.
SALVANO: Your English is getting good... You're showing it off. Showing it off on the street --
NARDO: I keep quiet.    I never talk no more --
SALVANO: Make yourself useful. (indicates empty wine bottle on table) Get downstairs, bring me one of these. (as Nardo stands, starts for back hallway) Then get back to work.
NARDO: (to himself) I thought I was dead, man. (whistles with relief) I thought I was fucking dead.
CHI CHI: You were right, cabron.
SALVANO: (to busboys) Clean up this mess.
CHI CHI: Who knows who else is talking --
SALVANO: He was a young fool.
CHI CHI: We're crazy waiting for this bullshit 'shipment.' Let me waste the other fucker now.
SALVANO: Be patient. This will be done the way it was planned.
JACKSON: Toscani, you're going to have me doing time.
NICO: Lighten up, Jax. No one's bringing this into court.
JACKSON: Except against us.
NICO: I don't give a shit how we do it. I just wanna get there.
JACKSON: I thought you said you were gonna protect me. Cover my butt. Be my guardian angel --
NICO: I got the shipment.
JACKSON: What?    What's he saying?
NICO: (scribbling furiously) '... Engine block has cleared customs. Serial number VA-748. Pick up Tuesday, 3 May as authorized.'
NICO (V.O.): Unit Ten Tango X-ray. I need a vehicle registration I.D.
POLICE RADIO (V.O.): Go ahead, please.
NICO (V.O.): '86 Lincoln.    Illinois 354 Dog '67.
POLICE RADIO (V.O.): Vehicle registration follows. Leaseholder: Ramon Testamente, registered alien. Nation of origin: Venezuela. Do you wish criminal record search?
NICO: (into mike) I want to know when he wipes his behind.
JACKSON: Salvano?
NICO: Jackpot.
HOSTESS: Two for dinner?
NICO: Two for drinks.
JACKSON: Gimme something stiff.   I need it.
BARMAID: Who doesn't?
NICO (O.S.): You'll have your engine block next Tuesday, boss.
JACKSON: Why couldn't it be a week from Tuesday? I could read about it in the paper.
NICO: Cheer up, partner.   I'm gonna make you famous.
JACKSON: You missed a few spots, boys.
LUKICH: I'm takin' it home t'a make kilbasa, boss.
LUKICH: This ain't a bust -- it's a convention.
NICO: Don't you like company, Luke? (sarcastic) We got all the scouts here -- Drug Enforcement Agency, the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms --
WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.): Keep this channel clear, Toscani.
NICO: (into mike) This is our channel, dickhead. And our collar.
ANOTHER WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.): That's enough, all of you! Keep this channel clear.
1ST WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.): All right. Everyone get their heads outa their ass.
JACKSON: (sarcastic) '... And so I quit the police department... got myself a steady job -- '
LUKICH: They spotted me. I'm too good- looking to be a meat slopper.
1ST WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.): Will you hot dogs shut up?
NICO: (to Lukich) You're too ugly.
NICO: (into hidden mike) Here we go, boys and girls -- (to Jackson) You stay put.
NICO: (into hidden miki) It's going down now. Move!
LUKICH: Police!
LUKICH: (shouts; points) Nico!   The Lincoln!
NICO: (to Salvano) How many kilos you got in there, Skivuzo?
NICO: What kinda fuckin' high is this?
SALVANO: -- I'll tell you what this cop is. He's a fucking menace!
SALVANO: You see what he did to me?!
AGENT HALLORAN: Your problem is being handled right now, Mr. Salv --
SALVANO: Yeah? Well, it shoulda been handled twelve hours ago. I don't know who's running this outfit, but somebody better get his goddamn wires straight!
AGENT NEELEY: (into phone) -- yes, sir... yes, sir, I understand --
SALVANO: That maniac should be wearing a number, not a badge.
AGENT NEELEY: (into phone) -- count on it, sir. Right. You'll have our full cooperation.
AGENT NEELEY: You're free to go.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: (to Nico, DEA -- This is no reflection on the work you officers have done. I feel, and the whole department feels, extremely proud of your initiative and gallantry.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: As all of you   are well aware, possession of   these explosives is a federal   offense and under jurisdiction   of the F.B.I.
NICO: Sir. With all respect to our brothers in the Bureau -- (biting sarcasm; turns to Neeley) -- That's no answer. It's no answer to why one of the biggest dealers in the city is out on the street now, free as a bird!
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: Keep it in your pants, Nico. These men have a job to do, just like us.
AGENT NEELEY: Lieutenant, I think these officers are entitled to a fuller explanation.
AGENT NEELEY (CONT'D): They've risked their lives. I understand one man is in the hospital.
AGENT NEELEY: What I'm about to say doesn't leave this room. Is that clear?
AGENT NEELEY: Mr. Salvano has been working for some time in cooperation with certain federal agencies.
AGENT NEELEY (O.S.): I'm not at liberty to divulge the nature of Mr. Salvano's involvement -- I just learned of its existence myself a few hours ago. But one thing I can tell you --
AGENT NEELEY: Mr. Salvano's role is crucial to an extremely sensitive ongoing investigation. Any further surveillance, harassment, or unauthorized operations against this individual are forbidden. I must order you gentlemen -- (looking straight at Nico) -- with all respect for your work and your courage, to stand down.
NICO: (mocking)
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: (a glance to Jax)
AGENT HALLORAN: What's the story on your partner, Jackson? Did he learn this style or was he born with a brick up his ass?
JACKSON: He has ethics. Unlike certain others on this case.
AGENT HALLORAN: His 'ethics' are gonna cost him his badge and his gun.
JACKSON: You don't wanna catch him without no gun.
JACKSON: 'Cause what he do with his hands... make bullet holes look pretty.
AGENT HALLORAN: He bad?
JACKSON: Bad bad.
JACKSON: Is that enough? Can we do something normal now -- like eat lunch?
NICO: Anything you say, Jax.   How about Salvano's?
JACKSON: Let it be, Nico.
JACKSON: What... you kept his tape, too?
NICO: Poetry, ain't it?
NICO (O.S.): And now for some dessert.
NICO (O.S.): And that must be Mrs. Sal. So nice to see married couples still in love.
JACKSON: This is your mother's church, isn't it?
NICO: Yeah. But I bet she's never seen these boys in the choir.
FATHER GENARRO (O.S.): Nicola! That can't be you in church without the family!
NICO: Father Genarro.
FATHER GENARRO: This must be your partner in crime. (shakes her hand) I'm Father Genarro. I saw you at the baptismal party. (with a wink to Nico) What a partner.
JACKSON: Dolores Jackson (smiling, but impatient) Nico, we gotta go --
FATHER GENARRO: No, please -- (more serious now) It's good you stopped by. I have to show you something. Please.
FATHER GENARRO: The rats are getting bigger.
NICO: When did this happen?
FATHER GENARRO: Two nights ago. I didn't call the police.
FATHER GENARRO: (in Spanish) It's all right, son. These are friends.
FATHER GENARRO: (referring to the cops) These are friends. (to Nico) This is Father Tomassino.
FATHER TOMASSINO: How do you do?
JACKSON: I didn't know this church was a sanctuary, Father.
FATHER GENARRO: Yes. But, perhaps not such a safe one.
NICO: How long have they been here?
FATHER GENARRO: Too long. At least the kids can go to our school.
NICO: Who did it, Father?
FATHER GENARRO: (significantly)
NICO: Really, I don't mind coming by.
FATHER GENARRO: Tell me, Nico... When was your last confession?
NICO: I'm a married man, Father.   I've got no sins to confess.
FATHER GENARRO: You're a police officer, you have many sins to confess.
JACKSON: Amen.
FATHER GENARRO: (calls after Nico) You come back Sunday. I feel better when I see Nicola in church. (calls louder) You don't show, I'm phoning your mother!
ROSA: Father Genarro! I have you to thank for getting my son back into church!
FATHER GENARRO: It's amazing what shame can accomplish.
FATHER GENARRO: In nomine patris, filius et spiritu sancti... (etc)
SARA: (examines Julian's diaper) Way to go, Julian -- perfect timing.
SARA: (clutching baby) We're okay! We're okay!
ROSA: (in Italian) Help the others! Help them, Nico!
NICO: (forcefully) Help each other move outside.   Be calm.
NICO: Call 911. Tell 'em to send everything they got! (turns to his wife) Sara, get the baby and Mama outside.
NICO: I want a list of everyone that's been treated here today. Everyone.
JACKSON: Right.
NICO: Then find those sanctuary people, the ones we saw in the church basement --
NICO: Find out where they're from, why anyone would want to harm them.
JACKSON: Where are you gonna be?
NICO: Just stay near a radio.   I'll find you.
NICO: Sara... go down to the car; I'll be with you in a minute.
NICO: I need to talk to you. (a glance to Strozah and others) ... Alone.
AGENT NEELEY: (impatient) What the hell is it, Toscani?
NICO: You.   That's what the hell it is!
AGENT NEELEY: Get your goddam hands off me!
NICO: You let Salvano walk.
AGENT NEELEY: Salvano?! Are you crazy? (rips himself free) What does he have to do with this?
NICO: That was no cherry bomb in there. That was C-fucking-4! (struggles to master his rage) I've used that shit.
AGENT NEELEY: (composes himself; reclaims his dignity)
MAID: You gonna be in real trouble, mister, when El Senor Salvano find out about dis.
FIRST LATINO: (polite, casual) 'Cuse me, sir. Can I bum a light?
FIRST LATINO: (machete under jacket) Don't even think about it, motherfucker.
MACHETE MAN (FIRST LATINO): You come to our streets... fuck with our people. Now our people gonna fuck with you.
PIPE MAN: We ain't gonna shoot you, man. We gonna beat you to death. You gonna learn what it means to 'get down.'
FIRST GIRL: Fly, baby!
MACHETE MAN: (to Nico, in terror) No, hermano. Please --
NICO: Who put up the money?
MACHETE MAN: What money?
NICO: You didn't come after me for a piece of ass. (twists the youth's neck) Who paid you?
MACHETE MAN: I told ya!    No one!
NICO: (shouting) Shut up!
NICO: Give it to me!
MACHETE MAN: Jimmy Constanza!
NICO: If you're lying to me, I'll come and kill you right in your own fucking kitchen.
MACHETE MAN: Salvano!   Bautista Salvano!
NICO: Gracias, muchacho.
SARA: (softly) I can't sleep. Will you come and hold me?
NICO: Of course I will. I've been waiting to hear from Jax. She was supposed to get back to me by now.
SARA: Thank God you couldn't find your shoes. We would of have been sitting in the front row. (beat) Alright, I know the rules -- I don't ask you don't tell. But could've died today and I deserve to know. (beat) Why did we go to church this morning?
NICO: I'm willing to break   the rules; I'm willing to tell   you whatever I know. But I need    some time. Could you just give   me some time?
SARA: I'll bet that's her.
NICO: (into phone) This better be good, Jax.
MAN (V.O.): (filtered) It's bad, Nico.
NICO: (into phone) Long time, Nelson.
FOX: You should know not to use a name on an open line. (beat) I'm gonna talk for fifteen seconds, then I'm getting off. You're in trouble, Nico.
FOX (V.O.): (filtered) Serious, serious trouble. Take your wife and family and get them someplace safe now.
SARA: (grim) That was Fox, wasn't it?
SARA: (very concerned) Why is the C.I.A. calling you at two in the morning?
NICO: It's okay, sweetheart -- (crosses to her, puts his arms around her) -- You know what a crazy bastard Fox is. He gets drunk and forgets he's halfway around the world. He calls me.
NICO: He just wanted to make sure we got his Christmas card.
VOICE THROUGH DOOR (O.S.): F.B.I., Toscani. Open up.
NICO: (to one of cops) It's a little early for breakfast, O'Hara.
O'HARA: Sorry, Nico. (displays warrant) You're under arrest.
AGENT NEELEY: (reaches for Nico's gun) I'll take this, thank you.
NICO: No, you won't. I'm gonna give it to you.
SARA: (to cops; distraught) This is ridiculous -- there's no need for this!
NICO: It's all right, darling.
ROSA: (to cops) Who do you think you are -- coming in here like this, treating my son like a criminal?
SARA: Why are you terrifying us? There's an infant here!
AGENT HALLORAN: (to cops) Check that coat.
SARA: Get your hands off him!
NICO: (to Sara, allowing himself to be frisked) It's all a mistake, Sara -- It's gonna be all right.
SARA: (calls after them) The Police Association's got lawyers for this, you bastards!
AGENT HALLORAN: Illegal wiretaps. Unauthorized surveillance.
NICO: When were you born, asshole?
AGENT NEELEY: Associating with known felons. Disobeying direct orders --
NICO: Where's Jackson?
CROWDER: She's outa this.
AGENT HALLORAN: You're the rotten apple in this barrel, Toscani. We don't have to look any farther than you and your 'family.'
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: Nico! You damn fool! You wanna go to prison?!
CROWDER: (indicates more depositions) Unlawful entry. Illegal search and seizure --
NICO: (spits on papers) You'll never build a frame on this chickenshit.
AGENT NEELEY: (angrily) You were ordered to back off on Salvano. But you had too big a hard-on for that, didn't you--
NICO: (to Strozah) Fred.   You can't be in on this.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH: You're officially suspended, Toscani. I want your tin... and your iron.
NICO: You holding me?
AGENT NEELEY: You can walk for now. But don't walk far.
NICO: Sara, I'm okay. I love you.
SARA: Where are you? Why aren't you coming home?
JACKSON: -- I found the sanctuary people.
JACKSON (CONT'D): They're refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile. They won't talk to me, they're terrified of cops.
JACKSON: Ready for this? One of the people killed at the church was definitely not a congregation member.
JACKSON: Alan Singletary. He's an aide to Senator Harrison.
JACKSON: That's right. Harrison. Foreign relations committee. The guy who's been crawling all over the Central American drug connections.
NICO: (impressed) You're gonna make a helluva D.A., Jax.
LUKICH: God help us.
JACKSON: (savors the com- pliment) I've been at the Tribune all night, wearing out their Xerox machine. Harrison's staff has been compiling some kind of white paper. He's due to release it next week.
NICO: That's how Fox knew.
JACKSON: What?
NICO: Luke. I  want you to go to my house.  Call Branca... my mother has the number. Get my family ready to move out.
LUKICH: You got it, buddy.
NICO: Stay with 'em. We'll be there.
LUKICH: What's going on, Nico?   What happened?
NICO: I got a call last night. An old agency friend. He told me my family was in danger.
LUKICH: You got a weapon?
LUKICH: Try this on.
NICO: (to nun) Sister... you know me. Tell them there's no need for fear.
SISTER BONIFACIA: There is rubble all over the yard, Nicola.
NICO: I know there was a man here, from an American senator's office. Who was he going to speak to?
NICO: (to one woman) Was it you, senora? (to a man) Was it you?
REFUGEE WOMAN: The priest.
NICO: Who? (gently) Father Genarro?
REFUGEE WOMAN: The other one.
REFUGEE WOMAN: No. The young one. From Costa Rica.
SISTER BONIFACIA: Father Tomassino.
SISTER BONIFACIA: He came alone... two weeks ago. He had papers. Papers to give to the senator.
NICO: But the bomb... The bomb was planted to destroy the pulpit.
SISTER BONIFACIA: Father Tomassino was going to give the Mass that day. (shaken) Father Genarro talked him out of it.
NICO: (understands) It was Father Tomassino they were trying to kill.
NICO: Where is Tomassino?   Where is he now?
REFUGEE MAN: He run, mister. He go --
NICO: If you know where he is, you've got to tell me. I want to help him. I can help him.
NICO: You're outa this, Jax.    Go home.
JACKSON: (displays her notes) You see this list? Well, I'm not done.
JACKSON: I'm not a rookie, Toscani. Now, go home. Get your family out of here.
NICO: (calls after Jackson) Just paperwork, you understand?
NICO: Over here, you sons-a-bitches!
NICO: (eyes like an animal) Try it. Be my guest.
NICO: (gestures with gun) Over there! Move it! -- Now!!
NICO: Hands on the counter!
NICO: Don't tempt me, ASSHOLE --
LUKICH: (into phone) Yeah?
SARA: Your job and your family in one day, Nico. You're batting a thousand.
NICO: (softly) Sara...
NICO: You'll be safe with Uncle Branca. It's gotta be this way... I'm sorry.
NICO: Don't you think I'd rather be with you?
SARA: (no longer angry) -- Mama... you got your medicine? Don't forget the baby's sweater --
ROSA: I know about babies.
SARA: (of Nico's bloodied shirt) You sure you're all right?
NICO: I am if you are.
SARA: (trying to lighten up) Don't worry -- (touches him) We needed a vacation, anyway.
NICO: (crossing yard with Sara) I'll give you five minutes start.    We have to do it this way.
NICO: Where's Jax?
LUKICH: She thinks there may be documents at some guy's apartment.
NICO: They killed the wrong priest.
NICO: There was a second priest... from Costa Rica... hiding at the church. He was the one they meant to kill.
LUKICH: And you know where to find him?
NICO: No.
LUKICH: You're gonna need help.
NICO: Just stay with my family
LUKICH: What are you gonna do?
NICO: You don't want to know.
BRANCA: My sister's cousin's place. You're safe -- not even I can find this joint.
NICO: (rising from rear seat) Don't forget your seat belt.
AGENT NEELEY: Congratulations, Toscani. You just made number four on the most wanted list.
NICO: (another nudge)
CLERK: What can I do for you, lads?
AGENT NEELEY: There was a quantity of C-4 explosive brought in four days ago --
CLERK: Hell, that's gone.
NICO: When?
CLERK: Right away, pardner. They scooped that stuff outa here before we even got it tagged.
NICO: Who?    Who took it?
CLERK: (casual)
AGENT NEELEY: (to Clerk) We'd like to see the paperwork.
CLERK: You gotta sign.
CLERK: Yeah... I remember that guy. Flew in special from Langley. Bomb tech. Real nice fella -- (finds the form, lifts it from file) -- Here it is. Fox. Nelson Fox.
FEMALE (V.O.): (from car radio) -- Here it is, sir. Coming in from Langley now --
FEMALE (V.O.): (from car radio) -- That agent has been with the Central American desk, uh, since '84 --
AGENT NEELEY: (into mike) Thank you. That's what I wanted.
NICO: (motions with gun) Dump your shoes. Ditch your I.D. on the floor.
NICO: So you think I'm a lousy cop, huh, Neeley? Maybe I am. But I haven't got my face buried up Washington's ass.
AGENT NEELEY: Nobody buys me, Toscani.
NICO: Yeah? Then somebody pulled the plug on your brain, pal. You didn't come up with the second priest, did you? Or Harrison's dead aide. (as Neeley fumbles with his laces) Hurry up! (as Neeley obeys) You heard the radio. The Agency's pushing buttons and bodies are dropping like flies. You assholes are missing half the case!
AGENT NEELEY: Listen.     Toscani --
NICO: Watch your step.
CROWDER: The officer is alleged to be involved in illicit drug trafficking, racketeering and kidnapping --
NEWSWOMAN (V.O.): (on TV's) Police sources also speculate that Toscani may be connected to the suspect in the bombing of St. Elizabeth's parish church --
NEWSWOMAN (V.O.): (on TV's) -- the suspect is likely to be armed and considered to be extremely dangerous --
NEWSWOMAN (V.O.): In other news, Senator Ernest Harrison's presidential bid has...
WATANABE: So good to see you again, sir! (shakes Nico's hand) Come back near closing... five- thirty... we'll place your order then. Nico nods, fades like a shadow into the throng.     MUSIC
NICO: Listen, Wat... you know I wouldn't call in a favor --
WATANABE: Of course not. Just because you kept a few 'friendly' tribesmen from cutting my heart out and serving it up as Pad Thai?
WATANABE: The last six years I've been risking nothing but money. It's a kick to risk my ass again.
NICO: The old Spook.
JACKSON: (into phone) Jackson.
JACKSON: (into phone) -- Yes... yes, of course, sister, I know who you are. (listens) -- where... where are you?
WATANABE: -- No way to access Covert Ops directly. But Ornstein's at Princeton, he's got a database bigger than Langley -- (works keyboard lovingly) If I can't crack that turkey's code, it's time to hang up my rock and roll shoes --
WATANABE: -- ah, here! Here's a little trap door. Let's see if we can wriggle up into -- (watches the screen with anticipation) Personnel files! Operative dossiers. Will that do?
NICO: It's a start.
NICO: Fox has had a helluva career. (reads down page) '69 to '76, Cambodia, Laos. Operation Phoenix. Operation Green Mountain. Operaton Northstar. This is all Vang Pao, it's all heroin --
WATANABE: You friend has found his metier.
NICO: Run personnel retrievals on all these operations. I want the names of every company man who was on them.
NICO (O.S.): (thinking)
WATANABE: (finger tracks down screen) Central American desk. Central American desk. Central --
NICO: Thirty names from secret drug operations... and two-thirds of 'em are in Central America. (beat) All right. Run these two names: Bautista Salvano and Ramon 'Chi Chi' Testamente.
WATANABE: Those street dealers you were talking about? They're not gonna be in here.
WATANABE (O.S.): Well, kiss my ass. (reads) Both former Somoza secret police. (whistles, impressed) Recruited by agency, 1975. Trained Fort Benning, counter insurgency...
NICO (O.S.): Where's Fox's printout? (finds it, reads) 1976... Fort Benning. He recruited these pricks!
WATANABE: There's nothing left, Nico.     We've wrung these files dry.
NICO: (muttering to himself; thinking) Fox is here, in Chicago... or was here... (has an idea) ... Listen. Can this thing tap into airlines? Reservations records --
WATANABE: I can get you the ball scores, too.
NICO: Five agents   from Central American desk. All trained   assassins. All arrived in Chicago in   the last week -- and none of them has   left.
NICO: Thanks, Wat. You finally may have done some good for your country.
WATANABE: Where are you going?
NICO: To find a priest.
JACKSON: The nun phoned me. She said two men had been sneaking around the church. She sounded scared --
JACKSON: There's more. I got the papers from that senator's aide's apartment. Everything Harrison's been working on. It's all at my place.
VOICE (O.S.): (from within car) Once you're inside, you'll signal us.
SALVANO (O.S.): Don't be scared. Your life depends on this.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN: Exusame, por favor. Tiene dinero para...
ZAGON: You'll be in heaven in a few minutes, padre. But first I'm going to put you through hell.
ZAGON: You came here to talk to the Senator's aide, didn't you?
FATHER TOMASSINO: I tried.   But you killed him first.
ZAGON: Who told you about our plans?
FATHER TOMASSINO: This is from confession. I tell no one.
ZAGON: You wouldn't lie to me, Father?   It's a sin.
ZAGON: (almost with kindness) If you spoke to anyone, tell me now -- (indicates hypo) -- and I won't have to use this.
JACKSON (O.S.): That's an eyeball if I ever saw one.
NICO: You're our backup. If we come out running, then you can shoot.
ZAGON: Speak to me, Father -- who did you tell?
FATHER TOMASSINO: I know what you are. I know what beasts you are.
ZAGON: I want to know who you told.
FATHER TOMASSINO: (barely coherent) I told them... you make the ninos... see... castrating their fathers -- raping... mutilating their mothers ... And... (breaks down crying) ... and sometimes... to the ninos...
ZAGON (O.S.): -- Tell me the truth, Father --
ZAGON: (close to priest) -- Can we kill him? If you told anyone, about our plans to kill the senator, we cannot do it.
FATHER TOMASSINO: Nadie.   Nadie. Nadie.
NICO: Go!   Go!
ZAGON: (in Spanish, from apartment) Get him! Finish him!
ZAGON: Now!
NICO: (to Jackson's photo) -- Had to be a hero... another fucking hero. I'm sorry Jax.
NICO: -- Senator... -- (of papers, with scorn) -- dumb fuck... think they're gonna let you put 'em outta business --
JACKSON: (to Lukich) You call Nico's goddamn Uncle and find out if he's heard anything.
LUKICH: (wounded himself) You just shutup and take it easy, pal.
LUKICH: (on phone) We don't know what happened to him, Branca. Ya, she's gonna be alright.
BRANCA: Jesus Christ!
NICO: The motherfuckas got Jackson.
BRANCA: Lukich called. She's not dead. She's gonna make it. She was wearing a vest.
NICO: That broad didn't trust me.
BRANCA: It was picked up with your mail this afternoon.
BRANCA: Don't worry, they're booked on an early plane. They'll be out of the country tomorrow.
SARA: Oh my God, Nico!
BRANCA: He's fine.   The boy has ribs of steel!
ROSA: (touching Nico's brow) Enough of your humor.
BRANCA: (to doctor and bodyguards) Leave them. Leave them alone.
SARA: -- You've got to do it, Nico.    You know you have to.
ROSA: Listen to her, Nicola. (dead serious) Whatever you think of him, Federico is family. He is our family.
NICO: Ever notice how clean babies smell? Like nothing in the world has touched them yet.
SARA: If you won't go to him, I will.
NICO: (in pain) Don't push me like this --
SARA: Branca can put us on a plane -- but where can we fly to? Tibet? The moon? There's nowhere they can't find us.
NICO: You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
SARA: I'm talking about everything I've learned from you in the past five years.
NICO: You know I can't go to him.
SARA: Do you know why I love you? Do you know what it is about you that I've always loved? (as Nico fights his own emotion) Pride. It's what you have inside. You don't live the way other people live. You trust what you see as right and won't let anyone or anything make you stray from it.
SARA (O.S.): But now that pride may kill all of us. (beat) You've got to swallow that pride, Nico. Choke on it if you have to. Lay it aside.
MAN (O.S.): Is this the attorney?
ANOTHER MAN (O.S.): You can come now, Mr. Carlucci.
FREDERICO LARUSSO: I am only an old man. An old man with a cancer.
NICO: I don't have much time, Uncle.    So I must speak plainly.
NICO: (this is very painful for him) -- For as long as I've been old enough to think, I've hated you and hated everything you stood for.
NICO: I was so sure that you and I were on opposite sides of the fence... and that you and your people were destroying this country --
NICO: -- The most painful realization of my life was that the people I worked for and you are not far apart. (meets Larusso's eyes) -- And there's not much difference between what you are and what I was.
FREDERICO LARUSSO: I will be    candid with you. I knew, probably    before you did, that you would be    coming to me. I knew what you would    ask... and I had every intention    of refusing you.
FREDERICO LARUSSO: But it is a form of wisdom to know when to cease relying only upon yourself.
FREDERICO LARUSSO: You know, of course, that this Senator Harrison will never live to make his speech tomorrow. (as Nico acknowledges) You know, too, that as long as this man... this torturer --
NICO: Kurt Zagon.
FREDERICO LARUSSO: -- As long as this Zagon lives, nothing I can do will guarantee your family's safety. (beat) 'Ecce non uomine, ecce bestie.' You know Dante? (translates) 'These are not men, these are animals.'
FREDERICO LARUSSO: Memorize this address.
FREDERICO LARUSSO: Have you got it in your mind?
FREDERICO LARUSSO: Thank you, Mr. Carlucci. I trust you will give my love to my niece, Rosa.
NICO: I will do that, Mr. Larusso. (sincerely) I hope you will be well.
BRANCA: You got the architect's drawings? Wiring, floor plans --
NICO: It's all here.
BRANCA: I could help you from here on.
NICO: It's not your business.
NICO: Grazie, tio caro.
BRANCA: Take care of yourself, Nicola.
VOICE (O.S.): Not even you can hit him at this range, Nico.
NICO: That wasn't the plan, Nelson.
FOX: Close range, huh? Never work. Place is rigged, scanned every 35 seconds.
NICO: (back still turned) I was thinking of a mine on the roof. Remote-triggered, when the chopper comes in.
FOX: Roof's wired too.   Sensors every fifteen feet.
FOX: You can turn now.   Slowly.   Slooowly...
FOX: I figured you'd do your recon from this building.
NICO: You're looking fit, Nelson.
FOX: Getting a bit of a tire.
NICO: (indicates Fox's suit) Your own tailor?
FOX: Hong Kong.
NICO: You've gone a long way.
FOX: Uh uh.  Uhhh-uh... (motions Nico back) I know what you can do when you get too close to a man.
FOX: -- What's so hard to believe. I want to help you, you dumb guinea!
NICO: Fox the fixer.
FOX: If I wanted to cap you, I'd have saved myself this chit-chat. Make big points for me to bring in your scalp. I'd be White House material.
NICO: Is that what Zagon is?    One of your basement boys?
NICO: Bought with what -- opium from Cambodia?
FOX: And a ton a week of coke from other places.
NICO: Which he funnels here through Salvano. With the Company getting its cut.
FOX: Legal tender.
NICO: Still dodging appropriations committees, eh, Nelson?
FOX: That's my job, Nico.
FOX: Keep your nose in the corner. When we get out, stay five paces ahead of me. Cross down to the garage.
NICO: The Senator couldn't be bought, could he? He was gonna blow the lid off, so you cleared Zagon to frost him --
FOX: Keep walking.
FOX: If your name was Joe Smith I never would have caught it. But how many Nicola Toscani's are there?
NICO: You got it off the arrest sheet.
FOX: I tried to warn you, old buddy. I knew you had wiretaps. and I knew you wouldn't let 'em go.
NICO: Only I was too dumb to crack it. I was so busy trying to figure a code, I didn't even recognize Zagon's voice.
NICO: So we kill our own senators now.
FOX: Why not?   The Romans did.
NICO: (to Fox, watching the guests) Are we the Romans?
FOX: We're an empire too.
FOX: Would you rather spoon borscht and quote Lenin? (losing patience) I'm trying to save you, asshole! I got a spot for you. Thailand, deep under, no names, no numbers --
NICO: (emotion rising) (ticks off the beats)
NICO: (presses closer)
FOX: (moves gun into Nico's view)
NICO: (doesn't stop) -- not one C.I.A. agent has ever been tried or convicted, much less accused of any crimes. (closer still) You motherfuckers think you're above the law -- (right in Fox's face) Well, you ain't above mine.
NICO: Well... well.    What a team we have here.
ZAGON: (calls, friendly) We've been looking for you, Nelson.    I see you've found our friend.
NICO: Thanks for the help, Fox.
FOX: I didn't bring him, Nico.    I swear it!
ZAGON: Have you two been sharing fond memories? Reminiscing about the good old days?
FOX: (to Nico)
EVENING GOWN WOMAN: (grabs her husband's arm) Jack --
ZAGON: Bring in our friend, Nelson.
ZAGON: Be a good boy --
FOX: Dive, Nico!!
ZAGON: (to first agent, advancing) Move!
FIRST SECURITY GUARD: (shouts to Zagon) You there --
ZAGON: No!   I want him! I want him alive!
PISTOL AGENT (O.S.): -- this is bullshit, Zagon. We got work to do.
ZAGON (O.S.): All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
ZAGON: We've got an hour before the honorable senator. (hands towel to pistol agent) You've got to learn to take time, smell the roses.
NICO: How are you gonna do him, Zagon? In a motorcade? Or passing through a hotel kitchen?
ZAGON: I've used these little beauties many times to extract information -- (lifts a needle to the light) -- This'll be the first time I've ever used them... just for fun.
ZAGON: (to agents) Take his arms.
ZAGON: Hold him up!
ZAGON: This is where you came in, Toscani. Only, now it's where you're gonna check out.
ZAGON: That's it. Fight it, cherry. Fight it, so it speeds faster on its way --
ZAGON: Fight it. Till the vessels burst in your brain. Till the arteries rupture in your heart --
ZAGON: That's my boy. That's what I was waiting for --
ZAGON: A fool learns from his own mistakes. But a wise man learns from the mistakes of others -- (moves closer, blade in hand) You should have killed me when you had the chance, Toscani --
ZAGON: Can you feel the chemicals, cherry? You can't fight 'em much longer --
NICO: Long enough to finish you.
LUKICH: (shouting for anyone) Is there a hotel doctor?    Call 911!
T.V. REPORTER (O.S.): (in front of house) -- Senator Harrison has today issued a statement calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor --
ANCHOR (V.O.): Earlier this week, the Harrison Commission delivered its report on the growing C.I.A. scandal to Congress...
SENATOR HARRISON (V.O.): (on TV) -- officially-sanctioned deceit, murder and corruption, will continue until these men are brought to justice.
SENATOR HARRISON: Detective Toscani. I wanted to personally thank you. You are making it possible for a sliver of truth to finally come out.
SENATOR HARRISON: And this is Clayton Alspaugh of the fifth circuit court.
NICO: Your Honor.
JUDGE ALSPAUGH: Are you sure you're feeling well enough?
NICO: (to Alspaugh) If you're ready to listen, I'm ready to talk.
