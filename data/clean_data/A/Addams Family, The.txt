SHOOTING SCRIPT: April 11, 1991
GOMEZ: Think of it, Thing. He's been gone for twenty-five years. For twenty- five years we've attempted to contact Fester in the great
GOMEZ: . And for twenty-five years, nothing. Not a whisper, not a clue. I'm beginning to think my my brother truly is lost.
MORTICIA: ( CONTINUED )
GOMEZ: ( gazing at Morticia ) Look at her I would die for her. I would kill for her. Either way what bliss.
GOMEZ: ( adoringly ) Unhappy, darling?
MORTICIA: ( passionately ) Oh, yes, yes. Completely.
WEDNESDAY: Thank you, Grandmama.
GRANNY: You kids are going to have to kill your own breakfast this morning.
MORTICIA: Gomez. the sun. il me perce comme un poignard.
GOMEZ: ( wildly aroused ) Tish. that's French!
MORTICIA: ( nonchalant ) Cara mia!
GOMEZ: Cara mia!
GOMEZ: En garde monsieur sole! He thrusts and parries, pantomiming a duel with the shaft of light.
MORTICIA: Last night, you were. unhinged. You were like some desperate, howling demon. You frightened me. Do it again. Gomez, instantly aflame.
GOMEZ: Last night, you were. unhinged. You were like some desperate, howling demon. You frightened me. Do it again. Gomez, instantly aflame.
MORTICIA: Last night, you were. unhinged. You were like some desperate, howling demon. You frightened me. Do it again. Gomez, instantly aflame.
GRANNY: Lousy bucket of bolts.! The FOG MACHINE, straight out of a Jules Verne nightmare, is malfunctioning this morning, struggling to churn out its patches of fog.
GOMEZ: ( disturbed ) Granny - where's your fog?
FROM ABOVE: the fog machine hurtles downwards, missing decapitating Gomez by millimeters. It crashes below, smashing through the front porch roof.
WEDNESDAY: ( taking her bag ) Thank you, Lurch.
SAME TIME: Gomez is HITTING GOLF BALLS Thing serving as his tee while Morticia sips tea.
JUDGE WOMACK: Damn you, Addams!
GOMEZ: ( calls ) Sorry about the window, Judge! Keep the ball! I have a whole
MORTICIA: The little ones, off to school. Bless them.
GOMEZ: They grow up so fast, don't they?
MORTICIA: Too fast.
THEIR POV: Tires smoking, the school bus strains to chug down the road. Gleefully hanging from the rear bumper is Pugsley, dragging his heels.
GOMEZ: It's a milestone, Tish. This very evening our twenty-fifth seance. All those years, gnawed by guilt, undone by woe, burning with Oh Gomez, don't torture yourself. That's my job.
MORTICIA: ( yearningly ) Oh Gomez, don't torture yourself. That's my job.
GOMEZ: ( lustfully ) Imagine, Darling, if Fester did come back. Half-alive, barely human, a rotting shell.
MORTICIA: Imagine, Darling, if Fester did come back. Half-alive, barely human, a rotting shell.
GOMEZ: Don't tease.
TULLY: Let me go! Ignoring Tully, Margaret continues stiffly up the walk.
TULLY: ( to Gate ) Gimme that! Stop it! I'm warning you! It's not a good day!
MORTICIA: ( looking out ) Tully is here, darling.
GOMEZ: Please, Gordon, by all means - go.
FESTER: ( coming to his senses ) Mother, I'm. I'm so terribly ( he kneels at her side ) It was just a party. It's over. It means nothing. Those Siamese twins, that hunchback, Cousin It - they're not you.
ABIGAIL: ( clutching him Say it, Gordon. Make me believe it.
FESTER: I love you. And I want money.
ABIGAIL: ( very no-nonsense ) We've got to find Tully.
MORTICIA: ( whispering ) Look - our little boy.
GOMEZ: ( whispering ) All tuckered out.
MORTICIA: ( whispering ) So sweet. He looks just. like a little entree.
PUGSLEY: ( sleepy ) Where. where's the party?
MORTICIA: It's over, darling - have you seen your sister?
PUGSLEY: Not since before the Mamushka.
MORTICIA: Don't fret - we'll find her.
GOMEZ: Don't fret - we'll find her.
GOMEZ: Fan out. Pugsley - head for the dung heap. Mama and Morticia - the shallow graves. I'll take the abyss, and Lurch - check the bottomless pit.
MORTICIA: ( worried ) Her favorite.
GOMEZ: ( calls out ) Up here.
GOMEZ: Fester! You take the ravine! And the unmarked, abandoned well!
FESTER: Somebody should stay behind - in case she comes back.
GOMEZ: Good man! Good thinking!
GRANNY: Then who'll take the swamp?
GOMEZ: That's the spirit, Thing - lend a hand! Let's go!
THEIR POV: Spread far and wide over the grounds, the various members of the family search for Wednesday, tiny lights aloft, They head out.
ABIGAIL: Where the hell is Tully?
ABIGAIL: What are you doing?
TULLY: Relaxing. Taking a little sun.
ABIGAIL: Have you gone mad?
TULLY: Au contraire.
THE NIGHT: Torch aloft, Pugsley searches through the primeval forest.
GRANNY: ( calling out ) Wednesday! Wednesday!
MORTICIA: Oh, Mama, I was sure we'd find her Gomez reaches a stately mausoleum at the far end of the cemetery. Two proud marble vultures guard the entryway. Gomez lowers the uplifted claw of one of the vultures and the stone doors slide open. He steps into -
GOMEZ: What's all this?
TULLY: hurries down the walkway, waving his legal document.
TULLY: This is a restraining order, Gomez.
GOMEZ: A restraining order?
TULLY: It requires you to keep a distance of one thousand yards from this house. You've got about nine hundred and ninety-nine yards to go - catch my I am restrained - from my own house!?
GOMEZ: ( in disbelief ) I am restrained - from my own house!?
TULLY: Not your house, moustache! Not any more! It belongs to the eldest living descendant, the older of the brothers Fester Addams!
GOMEZ: But - this is lunacy!
MORTICIA: Fester adores Gomez!
TULLY: He's afraid of him. Seeing the twins brought it all back. You're bitter rivals, Gomez - always were, always will be!
GOMEZ: It's not so! Those girls meant nothing - he knows that! I demand to see Sorry - no can do. He's very hurt - it's not a good time. Leave it alone. Or better yet - just leave.
TULLY: Sorry - no can do. He's very hurt - it's not a good time. Leave it alone. Or better yet - just leave.
WEDNESDAY: But he isn't even Uncle Fester.
GOMEZ: ( to his family ) Do not fear - justic shall prevail. The courts will decide! ( fervently ) They say a man who represents himself has a fool for a client. Well, with God as my witness - I am that fool!
C.U. GAVEL: hammers on the Judge's bench. PULL BACK to reveal
JUDGE WOMACK: is the presiding judge. He hammers the bench again, then reads his decision.
JUDGE WOMACK: Given applicable standards of proof, the attempts to impugn this man's character or question his identity have been woefully inadequate. It is with no small amount of personal satisfaction that I declare Fester Addams legal executor of the Addams estate and rightful owner of all properties and possessions contained herein. Gomez Addams. I believe this is yours.
GOMEZ: already sits in the passenger seat of the Duesenberg, his coat draped over his shoulders as if he were an invalid, his head thrown back. Morticia carries out Cleo, her carnivorous plant. Granny carries her favorite cauldron, Wednesday one of her Marie Antoinette dolls, Pugsley his chemistry set. Lurch uproots his favorite tree and joins the procession. Thing follows, dragging a toy wagon packed with his rings, his glove.
FESTER: standing at a second story window, watches the car drive THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 11/28/90 92 . 130 EXT. WAMPUM COURT - LATER. 130 A two-story NEON ARROW points the way to this bungalow court Bright and awful ersatz western. LOG CABINS OF SIMULATED WOOD surround the TEEPEE-SHAPED OFFICE. The Addams' Duesenberg is parked in front of the furthest cabin. The asphalt has been ripped up in big chunks and Lurch's tree is parked next to the Addams' new home.
GRANNY: I like it.
MORTICIA: Just as long as we're together, n'est pas, mon cher?
GOMEZ: sits slumped in a chair made from wagon wheel and nauga- hyde. It's as if all of his insane, vibrant energy has been leeched from him. He's a broken man. He looks back at her as if he's never heard French.
GOMEZ: Wednesday tends to him. She and her mother exchange a worried look.
PUGSLEY: comes from the bathroom, nibbling a wrapped bar of motel
PUGSLEY: This place isn't so bad. They even put candy in the bathroom.
MORTICIA: That's the soap, dear.
PUGSLEY: He takes another greedy bite. Wednesday pats her father's arm.
WEDNESDAY: Do you want a cigar, Father?
GOMEZ: ( in a monotone ) They're very bad for you.
WEDNESDAY: ( very worried )
GOMEZ: But maybe I'll have one of those.
ABIGAIL: ( to Fester ) You're doing this on purpose.
MORTICIA: We are Addamses, and we will not submit. Who recalls the fable of the tortoise and the hare? The swift, yet lazy little cottontail, and his slow but determined companion? What does that story teach us, as Kill the hare. Skin it. Boil it.
GRANNY: Kill the hare. Skin it. Boil it.
WEDNESDAY: Put the tortoise on the highway.
PUGSLEY: During rush hour.
MORTICIA: Yes! We will survive! Poison us, strangle us, break our bones - we will come back for more. And why?
GRANNY: Because we like it!
PUGSLEY: Because we're Addamses!
GOMEZ: ( out of it ) We're Addamses.
PUGSLEY: Here, Lurch. On the house.
PERSONNEL OFFICER: We have so many homemakers re-entering the work force - your domestic skills can be very valuable. College?
MORTICIA: Private tutors.
PERSONNEL OFFICER: Spells and Hexes.
MORTICIA: Spells and Hexes.
PERSONNEL OFFICER: ( knowingly ) Liberal Arts. Have you been a volunteer, PTA, service organizations?
MORTICIA: Well, one day each week I visit Death Row at our local prison, with my With your children?
PERSONNEL OFFICER: ( perplexed ) With your children?
MORTICIA: PERSONNEL OFFICER
PERSONNEL OFFICER: Well, what about your husband? Is he currently employed?
MORTICIA: He's. he's going through a bad patch at the moment. But it's not his fault.
PERSONNEL OFFICER: ( with some bitterness ) Of course not. What is he - A loafer? A hopeless layabout? A shiftless dreamer?
MORTICIA: ( wistfully ) Not anymore.
ABIGAIL: The Mediterranean, the Riviera - once we find the money, we'll go everywhere. We'll try again, right after lunch. Gordon - where should we go first?
FESTER: ( sadly ) I don't know.
ABIGAIL: Acapulco? Cancun? Ariba! Ariba!
FESTER: You choose.
GIRL SCOUT: ( with grave doubts ) Is this made from real lemons?
WEDNESDAY: GIRL SCOUT
GIRL SCOUT: I only like all-natural foods and beverages. Organically grown, with no preservatives. Are you sure they're real lemons?
PUGSLEY: ( CONTINUED )
GIRL SCOUT: Well. I tell you what. I'll buy a cup, if you buy a box of my delicious girl scout cookies. Do we have a deal?
WEDNESDAY: Are they made from real girl scouts?
MORTICIA: . and so the witch lured Hansel and Gretel into the candy house, by promising them more sweets. And she told them to look in the oven, and she was about to push them in, when, low and behold, Hansel pushed the poor, defenseless witch into the oven instead. Where she was burned alive, writhing in agony. Now, boys and girls, what do you think that feels like? After a beat, all the toddlers begin to CRY and WAIL.
GRANNY: Here kitty, kitty, kitty.
ALEX TREBEK: ( reading from Monsters Of History for $200. "He was known as the Butcher of Bavaria."
GOMEZ: ( shouts ) Grandfather Addams! ( smacks his forehead, Damn! Not in the form of a question!
GERALDO: Voodoo zombies - the stuff of legend, or a living nightmare? Do zombies really exist? How are they made? Where can we find them? Call in with your comments.
ABIGAIL: After lunch, we'll try again.
FESTER: ( very flat ) Yes, Mother.
ABIGAIL: We'll find the money. And meanwhile, we have this little nest. Quiet and cozy. Without that dreadful family.
FESTER: Yes, Mother.
ABIGAIL: Just the two of us, away from the world. Our dream come true.
FESTER: Yes, Mother. As Fester repeats "Yes, Mother", in his drone, Abigail mimics him, silently.
GERALDO: So your son was brainwashed by voodoo slave masters and forced to recruit others. Let's take a call.
GOMEZ: ( on the studio PA system ) ( cutting him off ) Mr. Addams, please stop calling. We don't know where they meet.
GERALDO: ( cutting him off ) Mr. Addams, please stop calling. We don't know where they meet.
GOMEZ: He switches off the set and stares at the blank screen.
PUGSLEY: I don't understand. All he does is watch TV and eat.
MORTICIA: I know - Gomez, let's go for a drive. The whole family.
GOMEZ: ( not even turning ) A drive? And miss "Matlock"?
GRANNY: Dinner's going to be late. She slams the door. We hear her whistling.
WEDNESDAY: If that man isn't Uncle Fester, then who is he, mother?
MORTICIA: I don't know, darling. I wish I did.
WEDNESDAY: Why is that lady doing all this?
MORTICIA: It's hard to say. Sometimes people have had terrible childhoods. And sometimes they just haven't found their special place in life. And sometimes they're dogs from hell and must be destroyed. Morticia kisses Wednesday and she closes her eyes to go to sleep.
ABIGAIL: I know why you've been so glum. It's because it's taking us a little longer than we'd hoped to find the gold. Isn't that right? Fester turns away, depressed.
ABIGAIL: Of course it is. Well, don't you worry - we're right on the verge. Tomorrow, for certain, my darling. You know, some people might think it's strange, for a mother and son to be so close. I think it's beautiful. Don't you, Gordon? Fester mumbles something, under his breath.
ABIGAIL: ( very stern ) ( dutifully ) Yes, mother. It's beautiful.
FESTER: ( dutifully ) Yes, mother. It's beautiful.
ABIGAIL: ( instantly very sweet, Look - I'm weeping.
MORTICIA: Stop it, you two.
MORTICIA: I would like to speak with Fester.
TULLY: We've been expecting you.
MORTICIA: ( to Abigail, graciously ) You are a desperate woman, consumed by greed and infinite bitterness. ( a beat ) We could have been such friends.
ABIGAIL: I don't think so. The vault, Mrs. Addams - any thoughts?
MORTICIA: ( sweetly, to Abigail ) Despite everything, I don't hate you. I pity you. Persecution, fiendish torture, inhuman depravity - sometimes it's just not enough.
ABIGAIL: Gordon - let's get started.
FESTER: But, Mother.
ABIGAIL: Stop stalling!
FESTER: I'm not stalling! Stop badgering me!
ABIGAIL: ( pushing Fester aside ) Tully, take over! Tighten it!
TULLY: I'd love to, you know that, but - I've got this stomach thing. When I torture people. It's just me.
ABIGAIL: ( shoving Tully toward
TULLY: ( to Morticia, Where's your bathroom?
ABIGAIL: Tully shuts his eyes and tightens the rack. Morticia's bones make a horrible POPPING, STRETCHING SOUND. She MOANS, rather sensually.
NOW!: Tully shuts his eyes and tightens the rack. Morticia's bones make a horrible POPPING, STRETCHING SOUND. She MOANS, rather sensually.
ABIGAIL: Tully tightens the rack again. More BONE-POPPING NOISES. Morticia MOANS again, even more orgasmically.
ABIGAIL: Tully tightens the rack a third time. BONE-POPPING NOISES. Morticia MOANS, very voluptuously. She opens her eyes. She sighs, in afterglow. She glances at Tully.
MORTICIA: ( to Tully, flirtatiously ) You've done this before.
GOMEZ: ( whispers ) Slow down, Thing! It's terrible when you stutter!
GOMEZ: Morticia in danger. stop! Send help at once . stop!
FESTER: ( to Abigail ) You can't! Not with red-hot pokers!
TULLY: ( queasy ) Is this gonna smell?
MORTICIA: ( graciously, with Tully Alford - charlatan. Deadbeat. Parasite. How Gomez adored you.
TULLY: Well, not enough.
FESTER: Morticia, please.
MORTICIA: Dear Fester - or whomever you are. Which is the real you - the loathsome, under-handed monster you've become? Or the loathsome, underhanded monster we came to love?
FESTER: ( desperately ) Don't ask me.
MORTICIA: Fester - I saw you tonight, at my window. I know it was you.
ABIGAIL: ( furious ) ( very upset ) I was. restless! I couldn't sleep.
FESTER: ( very upset ) I was. restless! I couldn't sleep.
ABIGAIL: Gordon, I have a thought. Just a notion, top of my head. Tell me what you think. Since you and Mrs. Addams are so very close. Abigail takes a red-hot POKER out of the fire and hands it to Fester.
ABIGAIL: . be my guest.
GOMEZ: Cara mia!
MORTICIA: Mon cher!
ABIGAIL: Thing tosses Gomez a saber off the study wall. Tully also grabs a saber, and approaches Gomez from behind.
MORTICIA: Darling, take care! Without even looking, Gomez parries Tully's blow from behind. Then he whirls on Tully.
GOMEZ: Dirty pool, old man. Never again!
TULLY: This is for keeps, Gomez! Not just doubloons! Tully feints, then slashes - shredding the front of Gomez's One for you, Tully, and. Gomez ATTACKS - HIS BLADE FLASHING LIKE LIGHTNING. In a blur of action, Tully's sword is knocked from his hand and he's sent tumbling backwards, finally landing on his knees.
GOMEZ: One for you, Tully, and. Gomez ATTACKS - HIS BLADE FLASHING LIKE LIGHTNING. In a blur of action, Tully's sword is knocked from his hand and he's sent tumbling backwards, finally landing on his knees.
GOMEZ: . one for me! Tully looks up at Gomez with cowardly, pleading eyes.
TULLY: Gomez. it's Tully. I'm your lawyer. I'm on retainer.
ABIGAIL: ( to Gomez ) That's right! Now get moving - Addams, take him to the vault. And if you're not back in one ( the pistol aimed I displace her.
GOMEZ: Tish - seeing you like this. My blood boils.
MORTICIA: As does mine.
GOMEZ: ( touching the This wheel of pain.
MORTICIA: Our wheel. To live without you - only that would be torture.
GOMEZ: ( to Morticia ) To live without you - only that would be torture.
MORTICIA: ( to Gomez ) A day alone - only that would be
ABIGAIL: Knock it off! The vault, Addams - right now!
FESTER: But, Mother can't we. Can it, Gordon! Stop dragging your feet! You disgust me - you're nothing but a useless, snivelling baby! A stone around my neck! What was I thinking - I should've left you where I found you!
ABIGAIL: Can it, Gordon! Stop dragging your feet! You disgust me - you're nothing but a useless, snivelling baby! A stone around my neck! What was I thinking - I should've left you where I found you!
FESTER: No tricks, Gomez! That's the wrong
CLOSE UP: Gomez's hand is on the right book, "Greed," but Fester stops him from pulling it.
FESTER: Allow me.
GOMEZ: ( murmuring ) Good show, old man.
TULLY: Put that book down, Gordon! You don't know what it can do! It's not just literture!
FESTER: ( advancing on Tully ) Oh, really?
TULLY: I'm your friend, Gordon - think of the doubloons!
FESTER: They're not yours, Tully! Back off! ANGLE on Gomez, releasing Morticia from the torture wheel.
MORTICIA: Quickly, my darling! He helps her down from the wheel.
GOMEZ: Leather straps, red-hot pokers.
MORTICIA: Later, my dearest. ANGLE on Fester, facing off with Abigail, as Tully cowers.
ABIGAIL: Keep the book closed, Gordon - listen to mother!
FESTER: I'll never listen to you - not ever again!
ABIGAIL: I had to be strict with you - because I cared! Put it down!
FESTER: You never really loved me! ANGLE on Gomez and Morticia, nearing the bookcase.
GOMEZ: Come, my love - to safety!
MORTICIA: But what of Fester?
GOMEZ: ( calling out, to Fester ) Old man, this way!
ABIGAIL: Stop whining, you little good- for-nothing! Be a man!
FESTER: You're a terrible mother! There, I said it!
GOMEZ: ( calling out to Fester ) Old man! This way!
CHILDREN: Trick or. They freeze in mid-chant. We do not see who has opened the door, but the children do. After a beat, they SCREAM IN HORROR and run, terrified, back toward the street.
GRANNY: Well, it's their loss. I even made finger sandwiches. Perched on Fester's shoulder, Thing shakes in fear.
FESTER: ( petting Thing ) Oh, calm down.
GOMEZ: Pugsley, old man!
MORTICIA: ( delighted ) Look at you.
PUGSLEY: ( to Uncle Fester ) How do you like it?
FESTER: What can I say? He's going to break hearts.
GOMEZ: Let's get a picture! Lurch?
MORTICIA: Oh yes - in the den.

GOMEZ: Look, everyone! We have guests!
MORTICIA: Hello, Margaret. Cousin It - I almost didn't recognize you.
MARGARET: Isn't he handsome? Everyone keeps asking where he bought his costume.

MARGARET: ( to Wednesday ) And what are you, darling? Where's your costume?
WEDNESDAY: ( solemnly ) This is my costume. I'm a homicidal maniac. They look just like everyone
FESTER: Halloween - it's such a special time. Ghosts and goblins. Witches on broomsticks.
WEDNESDAY: Children begging in the streets.
FESTER: I'm so glad I can share this night with my family - my real family. Now that I've got my memory back.
MORTICIA: That unfortunate woman. Filled with But not enough.
PUGSLEY: ( to Fester ) She wasn't your mother. She just said that.

GRANNY: ( to Fester ) Thank God for that lightning. Knocked some sense into you.
PUGSLEY: Please, Uncle Fester?
GOMEZ: ( jovially ) For the picture?
PUGSLEY: For the picture? Fester pops a light bulb into his mouth. It lights. Pugsley giggles. Gomez stands up, having finished the pumpkin. He places it on a table, and lights the candle inside. The pumpkin glows. It has ONE EYE IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD. Everyone oohs and ahhs.
FESTER: You know, all the old sayings are true. There's no place like home. And blood is thicker than water.

FESTER: My own dear brother - who could be more precious?
GOMEZ: Blood is thicker than water, old man.
MORTICIA: ( touched by the And just as refreshing. Let us never be parted.
GOMEZ: Let us never be parted.
