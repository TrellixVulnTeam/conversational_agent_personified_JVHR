OLD DOCTOR: God forbid, no.
OLD DOCTOR: How many have you found there?
SAYER: Five. So far. I think there may be more. How are they?
OLD DOCTOR: How are they?
SAYER: As you described them. As they were back then. As "insubstantial as ghosts." Only I guess most of them were children then.
OLD DOCTOR: Yes. Children who fell asleep.
OLD DOCTOR: Most died during the acute stage of the illness, during a sleep so deep they couldn't be roused. A sleep that in most cases lasted several months.
OLD DOCTOR: Those who survived, who awoke, seemed fine, as though nothing had happened. Years went by - five, ten, fifteen - before anyone suspected they were not well. . They were not.
OLD DOCTOR: I began to see them in the early 1930's - old people brought in by their children, young people brought in by their parents - all of them complaining they weren't "themselves" anymore. They'd grown distant, aloof, anti-social, they daydreamed at the dinner table. I referred them to

SAYER: No. ,
MRS. LOWE: If you did you'd know.
SAYER: I'd like to examine him again-if that's all right with you.
SAYER: In a sense.
MRS. LOWE: He's very clever. Aren't you, Leonard. .
SAYER: Does this mean anything to you?

MRS. LOWE: One day I came hone from work and found him in his bed, his arm like this, reaching. "What do you want, Leonard?"
MR.S LOWE: He never spoke again. It was like he'd disappeared. I took him to Bainbridge later that year. November fourteenth, 1937. He was twenty.

SAYER: People with ordinary Parkinson's Disease sometimes complain that they've "lost their grace . . . " They have to think about the things we just do . . .

Sayer takes it from him and flings it pathetically not halfway back to its owners. The music CONTINUES OVER:

SAYER: I hope you'll forgive the inelegant presentation. I don't entertain much. ·/· .
SAYER: I can date my interest in science precisely, actually. I'd been sent off to boarding school - a place perhaps not quite as Dickensian as I remember it - when I happened to come across the periodic table of elements. I memorized it. Which I admit was a rather precocious thing for a seven year old to do. And I remember feeling . . . not so much a sense of accomplishment . . . as comfort. The halogens were what they were. The alkali metals were what they were. Each element had its place, and nothing could change that. They were secure, no matter what. You're not married.
LEONARD: You're not married.
SAYER: He smiles. Sips his tea. Silence except for the ticking of a clock somewhere. Then, very matter of factly -
SAYER: I'm not terribly good with people. I like them. I wish I could say I had more than a rudimentary understanding of them. Maybe if they were less unpredictable . . .
