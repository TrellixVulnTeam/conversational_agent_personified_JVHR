AMERICAN SNIPER: Written by Jason Hall Based on the book by Chris Kyle
CHRIS KYLE: Fucking hot box.
GOAT: Dirt over here tastes like dog shit.
CHRIS KYLE: I guess you'd know.
CHRIS KYLE: ( keys mike ) I got a military-aged male, on a cell phone, watching the convoy. Over.
CHRIS KYLE: ( keys mike ) He stepped off.
CHRIS KYLE: ( keys mike ) Hold up. I got a woman and a kid, 200 yards out, moving toward the convoy.
CHRIS KYLE: Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying
CHRIS KYLE: She just pulled a grenade. An RKG Russian grenade. I think she gave it to the kid.
CHRIS KYLE: You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?
THE BULLET: Leaps from the barrel. Cracks like a whip. The .300 round hurls forward, glinting as it enters the flesh of
MAN'S VOICE: Get back here.
WAYNE: Don't ever leave your gun in the dirt.
CHRIS: Yes, sir.
WAYNE: Helluva shot, son. You got a gift. You're gonna make a fine hunter someday.
THE BUCK: Glassy brown eyes look up at Chris. It's still alive.
WAYNE: Everything dies to give life.
CHRIS: Can it see me?
WAYNE: It's a deer, son.
WAYNE KYLE: ( hands him hunting knife ) You shot it, you deal with it.
PASTOR: We don't see with his eyes so we don't know the glory of his plan. Our lives unfold before us like puzzling reflections in a mirror. But on the day we rise, we will see with clarity and understand the mystery of his ways
WAYNE KYLE: Some people prefer to believe that evil doesn't exist in the world, and if it ever darkened their doorstep they wouldn't know how to protect themselves. those are the sheep.
WAYNE KYLE: Now we're not raising any sheep in this family and I will whoop your ass if you turn into a wolf
DEBBY: But we take care of our own. And if someone picks a fight with you or bullies your brother, you have my permission to finish it.
WAYNE: But we take care of our own. And if someone picks a fight with you or bullies your brother, you have my permission to finish it.
CHRIS: The guy was picking on Jeff.
WAYNE KYLE: That true?
JEFF: ( eye swollen ) Yes sir. Yes, he was.
WAYNE KYLE: ( turns to Chris ) And did you finish it?
WAYNE: Then you know who you are.
"AMERICAN SNIPER": 14 EXT. RODEO ARENA 14
JEFF: Wasn't nobody there and you come away with a belt buckle too damn big to wear. What you supposed to do with it?
CHRIS: ( grabs belt buckle ) You're supposed to get laid with it. I'm gonna wear it in and see if it puts Sarah in the mood.
JEFF: A strong wind'd put Sarah in the mood.
CHRIS: Is that what they say?
JEFF: You know what they called her in high Don't say it.
CHRIS: Don't say it.
JEFF: Sarah suck-a
JEFF: Shit man
CHRIS: Who wants to hump a rodeo star?
CHRIS: What the fuck
SARAH: You said you wasn't coming home until Why would you do this?
CHRIS: ( wounded ) Why would you do this?
SARAH: Just let him out. He didn't know.
CHRIS: ( shamed, steps aside ) You didn't know?
SARAH: What the fuck is wrong with you! What'd you expect? You drag me out here then run off with your damn brother every weekend!
CHRIS: Get out.
SARAH: You think you're a cowboy cause you rodeo? You're no cowboy. You're just a lousy ranch-hand and a shitty fuckin lay!
JEFF: Some people ain't worth fighting for.
CHRIS: But she was right.
JEFF: ( closing his eyes ) A job is a job. At least we're outside.
CHRIS: Jeff, wake up. Look at this
CHRIS: Look what they did.
CHRIS: I saw what they did, on our soil, and
NAVY RECRUITER: And you're from Texas and you're a patriot so it pissed you off.
CHRIS: Yes, sir. But I can't see myself on a ship. I'd wanna be in the fight
NAVY RECRUITER: You wanna fight? Meet the warrior elite.
CHRIS KYLE: NAVY RECRUITER
NAVY RECRUITER: Sea, Air and Land.
CHRIS: I ain't much of a swimmer
NAVY RECRUITER: ( taking brochure back ) This isn't for the faint of heart. Most men wash-out. They quit
CHRIS: ( cutting him off ) I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: ( sprays Chris in the face ) You a quitter, boy?
CHRIS KYLE: No, sir!
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: Bullshit, you are fleet-meat. Don't turn away. Look up and take it. You're old as fuck. Did you join the Navy cause you had such a good time on Noah's Arc? How old are you?
CHRIS: 30, sir.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: 30! You fart dust and could've fathered half these boys. You think cause you had a pop-gun back in Texas you're cut out to be a SEAL?
CHRIS: No, sir.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: No, you're not cut out to be one?
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: What kind of asshole joins the Navy but hates the water.
CHRIS: I love water, hooyah.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: My ass you do.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: Is that you giggling you fat fuck? Look at you. You're so fat they had to baptize you at Sea World. Your momma fat too?
RYAN: No sir, she's not.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: Don't lie to me! I bet we could use her panties as a parachute. What the fuck are you doing here fatboy? Do your feet get wet when you shower? When's the last time you saw your pecker? You're not a Seal, you're a fuckin Walrus. A big giggling Walrus. "Biggles" that's your new name
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: and that's your ticket home. Just drag your jelly-roll ass up and ring it and you'll be headed home to momma Shamu.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: ( whirls around, hosing ) Did I ask you to count?
CHRIS: No, sir.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: Was that your ass talking then?
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: That's a quitter. If he quits here, he'll quit in battle. When shit gets hairy he can't step up. You get shot, he can't pull you out. We're gonna weed out the quitters and see if we can find a warrior or two.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE: Wave goodbye to the sun, boys.
CHRIS: and when I told her the condom broke she started crying and begging me to do something. And I'm a virgin, I don't know what to do, but I'd heard if you pour Coke up there you won't get pregnant So we went to 7-11, got a liter of Coke and drove back into the woods. She took her panties off and did a handstand against a tree but when I start pouring, she starts screaming, "it stings, it stings" but when I'd stop, she'd scream "no don't stop" and it's fizzing out and
INSTRUCTOR "TONY": You really from Connecticut, Dauber? I never met a hick from Hartford.
DAUBER: Country is countrywide, sir.
INSTRUCTOR "TONY": I don't think he likes black dudes, "D".
"D": That's alright, sir. I'm not black.
INSTRUCTOR "TONY": No, I'm new black. We run slow, jump low, swim good and shop at Gap. We make white folk proud then hose their ladies.
"D": No, I'm new black. We run slow, jump low, swim good and shop at Gap. We make white folk proud then hose their ladies.
INSTRUCTOR "TONY": You hungry Biggles? I'd bet you'd eat the ass out of a low-flying duck.
BIGGLES: Hooyah. I'd toss that critter shitter on a baguette and get my eat on.
INSTRUCTOR "TONY": ( screams in his face ) Squirrel! Where'd you hide your nuts?
SQUIRREL: Nuts crawled up inside. The little shits are gone for good.
INSTRUCTOR "TONY": How about you old man? How you feeling?
CHRIS KYLE: Dangerous, sir. Feeling dangerous.
CHRIS: I'm gonna try and get into sniper school.
BIGGLES: Can you shoot?
CHRIS: I can hunt. And what's cooler than being a sniper?
BIGGLES: Blowing shit up. Blowing shit up is way
TAYA: ( end of her rope ) Will a drink make you 6 inches taller and charming? Will it make you not married?
TAYA: I watched you take your ring off. Don't be a scumbag. Go home.
CHRIS: It could be the leather pants.
TAYA: Yeah? What kind of pants does a girl have to wear to be left alone?
CHRIS: She takes him in. Loose sweatshirt, no hair gel.
TAYA: Is that how it is with you guys suddenly single after three beers?
CHRIS: Only thing that happens to me after three beers is a fourth.
TAYA: That's great. A real red-neck.
CHRIS: I'm no redneck, I'm a Texan.
TAYA: What's the difference?
CHRIS: We ride horses, they ride their cousins.
TAYA: ( almost laughs ) What do you do for work? You look like I polish dolphins. They have to be polished in captivity or their skin Do I look stupid to you?
CHRIS: I polish dolphins. They have to be polished in captivity or their skin Do I look stupid to you?
TAYA: Do I look stupid to you?
CHRIS: To be honest, you look a little sad.
CHRIS: So am I tall enough to buy you a drink?
TAYA: Not until you tell me what you do.
CHRIS: How about this: one shot, one answer.
TAYA: You're obviously military. What branch?
CHRIS: I'm just finishing BUD/S.
TAYA: Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL?
CHRIS: That was two questions.
TAYA: ( two angry shots ) I know all about you guys. My sister was engaged to a SEAL.
CHRIS: What's that mean you know all about us?
TAYA: You're a bunch of arrogant, self-centered pricks who think you can lie and do whatever the fuck you want. I'd never date a SEAL.
CHRIS: ( confused ) How can you say we're self-centered? I'd lay down my life for my country.
TAYA: Cause it's the greatest country on earth and I believe it's worth protecting. I'm sorry this guy hurt your sister but that's not me. Nice talking to you.
CHRIS: Cause it's the greatest country on earth and I believe it's worth protecting. I'm sorry this guy hurt your sister but that's not me. Nice talking to you.
TAYA: Where are you going?
CHRIS: You said you'd never date a SEAL, so I'm going home.
TAYA: I said I'd never marry one.
CHRIS: Well in that case. what's your name?
TAYA: Nice to meet you, Taya. I'm Chris Kyle.
CHRIS: Nice to meet you, Taya. I'm Chris Kyle.
TAYA: ( liquor softening her ) Pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all, isn't it Chris?
CHRIS: Our instructors say our biggest enemies are ego, liquor, and women.
TAYA: Sounds like you're under attack.
TAYA: I'm not going home with you so don't even think about it.
PO TOSH: Feel breath filling every cell of your body. This is our ritual. We master our breath, we master our mind-
PO TOSH: pulling the trigger will become an unconscious effort. You will be aware of it but not directing it. And as you exhale, find your natural respiratory pause and the space between heart-beats.
TAYA: You figured what?
TAYA: Did you always want to be a soldier?
CHRIS: I wanted to be a cowboy but I did that and I felt like I was meant for more.
TAYA: So you started rescuing girls from bars?
CHRIS: I rescued that bar from you.
CHRIS: Do you like country music?
TAYA: Only when I'm depressed.
CHRIS: You want kids?
TAYA: Someday. My mom says I have a nose for picking the wrong men.
CHRIS: That's a shitty thing to tell a girl.
TAYA: I've proven her right.
CHRIS: But those wrong picks put you here. They made you who you are. And I like who you
TAYA: What happens when there's a real person on the other end of that gun?
CHRIS: ( uncertain ) I don't know. I just pray I can do my job if that day comes.
PO TOSH: Mirage is boiling at 35 degree angle.
CHRIS: Check. I'm dialed for windage.
PO TOSH: Hold right-four, up-two.
PO TOSH: Are we looking at the same target?
CHRIS: You're trembling.
TAYA: I know. I don't.
CHRIS: We don't have to do this.
TAYA: I want to. I do.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Soft light on pale bodies. Taya writhes with impatient longing but Chris' steady hand forces her into the present. She's swept up, eyes filling with tears as he eases into her she gasps and arcs and draws him deeper.
PO TOSH: You need to shut your off-eye.
CHRIS: If I close my off-eye I can't see what's out there.
CHRIS: Negative. There's something
PO TOSH: Give me 50 push-ups. Clear and safe. Push `em out.
CHRIS: There it is.
TAYA: You hardly even know me.
CHRIS: I know enough. You're a package deal,
CHRIS: What are you afraid of?
TAYA: Nothing. Everything. I don't know. What if it doesn't work out?
CHRIS: I'm going to marry you, and we're going to start a family.
TAYA: You got it all planned out, don't you.
CHRIS: I love you. I'm done.
TAYA: ( crushed by his sincerity ) Well. you're gonna need a ring if you want to talk all tough like that.
TAYA: ( her hand smudged with paint ) What the hell is on your neck?
CHRIS: Would you believe me if I told you I was painted green and on an IV two hours ago?
TAYA: What do you
CHRIS: ( smiles ) Package deal babe.
"D": What's the word, Chief?
TONY: ( looks them over ) It's on boys. Just got the call.
CHRIS: They say it'll be over in 6 weeks.
TAYA: I'm so afraid.
CHRIS: Don't be afraid. It's all part of the
TAYA: Your heart is beating out of your chest.
CHRIS: ( nods, looking past her ) I'm not the only one going to war.
MARC LEE: AQI have put a price on your heads and extremists from around the globe are flooding the borders to collect on it.
MARC LEE: You snipers will be paired with a man to watch your back and inserted along the main road to do "overwatch" for 1st Marines going door to door. Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs.
MARC LEE: The city was evacuated. Any military-aged male still here, is here to kill you. Let's bring these boys in safe and get our asses back home. Move
WINSTON: Keep your head down, Tex. The Muj' got snipers too.
CHRIS: A sniper won't aim for your head.
WINSTON: They got this sniper that's been hitting headshots from 500 yards out
CHRIS: They got sniping in the Olympics now?
WINSTON: ( trailing Chris ) What're we looking for?
CHRIS: You ever hunt?
WINSTON: I ain't that kind of red-neck.
A GOAT: Bounds out of the bathroom, runs out the apartment door and leaps OVER THE RAILING, falling six floors.
RAILING: CHRIS and WINSTON look down to the lobby, where Marines stand around the DEAD GOAT.
CHRIS: ( laughing ) You just got your first kill, Goat.
CHRIS: I'm going to the roof. You stay here and be on the lookout for farm animals.
CHRIS KYLE: ( keys mike ) I got a military-aged male, on a cell phone, watching the convoy. Over.
CHRIS KYLE: ( keys mike ) He stepped off.
CHRIS KYLE: Hold up. I got a woman and a kid, moving toward the convoy.
CHRIS KYLE: Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying
CHRIS KYLE: She just pulled a grenade. An RKG Russian grenade. I think she gave it to the kid.
CHRIS KYLE: You got eyes on this? Can you confirm? Negative. You know the ROEs. Your call.
THE BULLET: Leaps from the barrel. Cracks like a whip. The .300 round hurls forward, glinting as it enters the flesh of
GOAT: You hear that?
CHRIS: Get the fuck off me.
MARC LEE: That's your overwatch, Einstein. You can thank him later. Keep moving.
LOOTED ROOM: CHRIS finds his stillness. The instant he does SHADOWS CREEP over him and night swallows the room.
WASHROOM: MUSTAFA flees down the hall. A fluttering shadow in darkness, except for the reflective swoosh on his Nikes.
LOOTED ROOM: Chris lays on the gun, brow pinched with onus, silence like a scream. This happened on my watch.
MARC LEE: Smells like piss in here. You covered our ass out there, man. Appreciate it. Those were ballsy shots.
CHRIS KYLE: And they were clean. Right?
MARC LEE: Hell yeah, they were.
CHRIS: ( finally looks up ) That sniper walked right up our ass.
MARC LEE: I chewed out our security detail. It won't happen again.
CHRIS: My shooter statements are on the dresser.
MARC LEE: Should be eight. Two got dragged off. Something wrong?
CHRIS: Should be eight. Two got dragged off. Something wrong?
MARC LEE: No. but you got more kills than the rest of the snipers combined.
CHRIS: They still got one of our guys.
MARC LEE: You can't shoot what you can't see.
BIGGLES: Heard you got your dick wet.
CHRIS: Where is everybody?
BIGGLES: We're just picking our dicks here, training those fucking haji soldiers.
CHRIS: Why ain't you out there?
BIGGLES: I got the shits. Marc Lee said you were on fuckin fire out there.
CHRIS: ( shedding gear ) You still read comic books?
BIGGLES: It's a fuckin graphic novel. Talk to me, man. Did you pop your cherry?
CHRIS: This kid didn't even have hair on his balls and his mom hands him a grenade sends him running off to kill Marines.
BIGGLES: ( sees his hurt ) You saw his balls?
CHRIS: It was evil, man. That was hate like I've never seen it before.
BIGGLES: That kid could've taken out ten Marines
CHRIS: ( wrestling with it ) I know.
BIGGLES: You did your job. End of fuckin story.
CHRIS: It's just not how you imagine the first one going down.
BIGGLES: How about the other ones? What about the other kills?
CHRIS: The other ones were righteous. Like God was blowing on my bullets.
SNIPER SEQUENCE: CROSS-HAIRS land on INSURGENT WITH RIFLE; INSURGENT PEEPING three times; INSURGENT BURYING IEDs. BAM-BAM-BAM.
OVERWATCH: CROSS-HAIRS land on INSURGENT WITH RIFLE; INSURGENT PEEPING three times; INSURGENT BURYING IEDs. BAM-BAM-BAM.
JAG OFFICER: Our task here is to make sure every kill is a righteous kill and conforms to ROEs.
CHRIS: By every kill, do you mean just our kills or you're monitoring the bad guys too?
CHRIS: Sorry, was that a question?
OVERWATCH: Chris takes over for a MARINE SNIPER in a window.
MARINE SNIPER: Haven't seen shit all day. Maybe the war is over and they forgot to tell us.
CHRIS: ( keys mike ) I got a armed military-aged male moving tactically with a car battery. Maybe he needs a jump?
JAG OFFICER: His wife said he was carrying a Koran.
CHRIS: Well, I don't know what a Koran looks like but I can describe what he was carrying it was pressed metal, fired 7.62s and looked just like an AK-47.
MESS HALL: ( 03.18.14 ) 38.
BIGGLES: Listen up ladies and genitals. The Legend here would like you to know that when it comes to sniping it's better to be lucky than good! Our boy here has a Texas horseshoe crammed so far up his ass that
CHRIS: That's not how the call-home goes, babe.
CHRIS: There are things we can't say over the You knocked me up and now I'm stuck here by myself assembling baby-cribs and you can't talk to me? That's the big plan?
TAYA: ( playful ) You knocked me up and now I'm stuck here by myself assembling baby-cribs and you can't talk to me? That's the big plan?
TAYA: You guys almost done over there yet?
CHRIS: I can't stop thinking about that pink silky thing you wore on our honeymoon.
TAYA: It's called a nightgown.
CHRIS: And three days is not a honeymoon.
TAYA: And three days is not a honeymoon.
CHRIS: It was a good three days. I miss you bad.
TAYA: ( curls up in chair ) You want me to talk dirty to you?
CHRIS: Yeah. But I got my gun in one hand and the phone in the other
TAYA: Well, you'll just have to decide what's more important.
CHRIS: You're horny preggers.
TAYA: Fat and horny. It's kinda disgusting.
CHRIS: You could be 300 pounds I'd still do you.
TAYA: -So romantic.
CHRIS: How's my boy?
TAYA: Nobody said it's a boy
CHRIS: I can't wait to see the way you are with him. You're gonna be incredible.
TAYA: ( harbors doubt ) How do you know?
CHRIS: I just know. I can see it.
TAYA: I hope you're right.
TAYA: ( suddenly ) Did your dad get hold of you?
CHRIS: I haven't checked any email.
TAYA: Shit. You need to call him. Hang up and
CHRIS: What happened?
TAYA: I'm so selfish. I wasn't even thinking
CHRIS: Your little brother deployed.
TAYA: Your little brother deployed.
CHRIS: What happened to jump school? I thought
TAYA: He didn't get in. Just call your dad
CHRIS: Deployed where? Where's he going?
TAYA: Over there. He's headed to Iraq.
COL. GRONSKI: His name is "Zarqawi" and he is the prince of al-Qaeda in Iraq. AQI, his mercenary army, are 5000 strong. They're trained well, paid well and waging the heaviest urban combat since Vietnam.
COL. GRONSKI: Zarqawi and his Lieutenants are our highest priority. Only way to root them out is to go house-to-house until we find them, or someone who will reveal their whereabouts. We need to clear ten structures an hour. It's aggressive so we'll loosen things up with air support
CHRIS: These Marines rush in like they been doing, they'll get their asses shot off.
MARC LEE: They're Marines. They don't get the training we do. Half of them were civilians six months ago.
CHRIS: So let's coach them up. I'll show them how Team Guys do it and lead a unit in the street.
MARC LEE: Can't do. We need you on overwatch.
CHRIS: But if I was down in the street
MARC LEE: House-to-house is the deadliest job here. You got some kind of savior complex? I just wanna get the bad guys. And I can't shoot them if I can't see `em.
CHRIS: I just wanna get the bad guys. And I can't shoot them if I can't see `em.
MARC LEE: You got a hot hand. These Marines all know your name now and they think they're invincible with you up there.
CHRIS: They're not
MARC LEE: They are if they believe they are. Just keep banging on the long-gun and let these ground-pounders sniff out Zarqawi.
CHRIS: You said that AQI sniper was in the Olympics but Iraq hasn't qualified a shooter in the last three games.
GOAT: Mustafa's not Iraqi. He's from Syria.
CHRIS: ( keys mike ) Once you make entry I can't see shit, so keep it slow and push through the target.
CHRIS: Fuck this I'm going down to clear houses with the Marines. You coming?
GOAT: No man. No. I like my life. I wanna make it home. I go fishing and do all kind of cool shit. It's not my job to knock down doors. Those guys picked the wrong fucking job. I ain't doing that shit.
CHRIS: ( smiles ) If I don't see you down there, you make sure I don't see you again.
CHRIS: ( bowls up ) You wanna be a sniper? Swap me guns.
"JEFF" MARINE: I'll roll with you guys if that's cool?
CHRIS: I'll roll with you guys if that's cool?
CPT. GILLESPIE: Hey, any Navy Seal is cool by me.
THOMPSON: You're that guy. They're calling you The Legend. You got like 24 confirmed kills.
CHRIS: It's 32. But who's counting.
THOMPSON: That's badass.
SANCHEZ: There's some boy in Bravo catching up.
CHRIS KYLE: ( packs a dip ) Y'all are meateaters for sure but I got a little training I could show you, some simple shit, that might just keep us above ground. What do you say?
SANCHEZ: ( low ) -Whas that mean again?
GILLESPIE: Cover and follow.
CHRIS: Down. Down! On the floor, now!
CHRIS: I will fucking shoot you! Down! Get down
GILLESPIE: He does look a little retarded.
CHRIS: You were ordered to evacuate. Why are you still here?
SANCHEZ: I found these bitches in the back closet.
SANCHEZ: This sand nig' want us in here so he can blow us up. Check his ass for a vest.
CHRIS: Who will know we've spoken?
CHRIS: Bring the other guys in.
CHRIS: Who is he? I need a name.
TERP: He calls him - the pure flame of fire- . Basically, this man comes to their house and prey on the weak with hurt.
CHRIS: So he's some kind of enforcer?
CHRIS: ( jumps ) We want Zarqawi. Where do we find
CHRIS: How do we find him?
TERP: He will ask for money.
CHRIS: We don't even have proof this guy exists.
CHRIS: I'm sorry. I want to help you. I do. But I need names, places, phone numbers
THOMPSON: ( rushes in ) Hey, we got a Marine unit pinned down in a house just uprange
CHRIS: Give me a name, Sheik. Give me something.
THOMPSON: They're out of ammo. If we don't go now
AGENT SHEAD: I guess that translates to "pay me" in just about any language, doesn't it?
CHRIS: Yes sir, it does.
MARC LEE: And you're the secret squirrel with the cash, right?
AGENT SHEAD: ( not amused ) When you were having tea with Sheik al- Obedie did he tell you he ran a network of highway bandits before AQI moved in?
CHRIS KYLE: He left that part out.
AGENT SHEAD: That's AQI's racket now. Your Sheik got edged out. This could be blowback.
CHRIS: Or he could be upset The Butcher cut off his wife's hand. Either way, seems like you'd wanna explore it.
AGENT SHEAD: This is your guy here. We believe The Butcher is Zarqawi's number two man.
CHRIS: But you don't know his real name or you'd have it written up there.
AGENT SHEAD: We have several aliases If "Fanus" is legit we go see the Sheik.
MARC LEE: He's asking for 100,000.
AGENT SHEAD: If he delivers the Butcher he'll get it. This is Agent Shead, DIA, I need a name check on "Amir Khalaf Fanus." I'll wait.
CHRIS: If we're going back out, TEAM 3 could pull security
AGENT SHEAD: If we're humping money the head-shed will want contractors on it. I'm here. What do you got?
CONTRACTOR: They sit on benches opposite CHRIS and MARC LEE, a shrink- wrapped PALLET OF CASH between them. AGENT SHEAD sits closest the driver, playing big-dick with the mercs.
AGENT SHEAD: The Butcher is Zarqawi's enforcer. They say his weapon of choice is a drill.
MARC LEE: I went to seminary school before I joined the Navy. Came close to being a preacher.
CHRIS: Why didn't you?
MARC LEE: I love to gamble, man. Love those dice.
CHRIS: My kind of preacher.
MARC LEE: It's like that now, huh?
CHRIS KYLE: You haven't heard? I'm The Legend. Hey babe
CHRIS KYLE: It's a boy!
MARC LEE: Hell yeah. Congratu
TAYA: EXT. CITY SQUARE/ STREET Looted shops, burnt awnings, colorful signage. MARC LEE and CHRIS pile out. THE SAT PHONE falls in the dirt.
MARC LEE: I heard one shot.
CHRIS KYLE: Check. Large caliber. Came in at an angle, gotta be 300 or more out
MARC LEE: ( ducks back ) He's all over us. You get a bead?
CHRIS KYLE: AGENT SHEAD ( OC )
CHRIS: Minaret, 11 o'clock!
AGENT SHEAD: ( from Humvee ) There's no room. We'll come back for you
CHRIS: You got eyes on that?
MARC LEE: Their cover prevents line-of-sight. Chris reaches his rifle out ADJUSTING A SIDE-MIRROR on the crashed Humvee
CHRIS: Eyes on The Butcher. He's got that Sheikh's kid in the street
CHRIS: MARC LEE ( into radio )
MARC LEE: ( into radio ) requesting back-up. We're pinned down taking sniper fire on approach of high- value target, GRID 04536236. Over.
MARC LEE: We're on the wrong end of this.
CHRIS: I'm gonna pop smoke for cover but don't move till I say.
CHRIS: The drill revs. Omar is screaming. Smoke spewing.
MARC LEE: We gotta go
CHRIS: Holding! Hold.
CHRIS: Move now. Go
MARC LEE: How you know he'd wait
CHRIS: Cause I'd wait.
TAYA: ( sobbing, into phone )
THE BUTCHER: He powers up the drill and drives it into Omar's thigh. OMAR SCREAMS and pitches, shrieking for help
ALLEY: Chris and Marc racing down an alley, approaching stairs
CHRIS: Go around. I'll go high.
ROOFTOP: CHRIS runs onto the exposed rooftop, running into A DOG SNAPS at him, BARKING and rabid, chained to a US sig M- 60. He dives away from it, crouching behind the wall.
THE BUTCHER: Powers up the drill, THE BUZZING rings over his words
THE BUTCHER: ( in Arabic ) You talk to them, you die with them.
CHRIS: Hears the drill and Omar's screams. He'll be exposed but HE POPS UP to shoot The Butcher. Before he can get set A SNIPER ROUND clips his helmet. He's knocked flat-back. Clouds strobe overhead. The dog barks viciously inches from his face. Saliva flying off incisors as
THE SHEIKH: Watches the drill enter his son's face. The Sheikh breaks free of the Butcher's men, running towards his son. TWO AKs shred his back and he pitches forward, reaching
SNIPER POV: As the Butcher and his men drive away, CROSS-HAIRS track across the rooftop, where
CHRIS: Rage animates him. He staggers to his feet, FIRING HIS M4 on the minaret until the clip expires. Then A FLUTTER of cloth sweeps across an alley a block north. MUSTAFA slows, rounding the corner, and glances back Chris draws his .45, but Mustafa slips into the shadows. Women sob over dead bodies in the street below.
CHRIS KYLE: He had line-of-sight 500 meters out.
BIGGLES: Colonel Gronski is all over Marc, bro.
CHRIS: We need to work up a squad to pursue him.

CHRIS: Can you give me a second?
CHRIS KYLE: Hey, grunt
JEFF: Jeff is slow to react, like he can't see past the atrocity branded on back of his eyeballs.
CHRIS KYLE: Y'alright? You in one piece?
MARINE LCPL: Let's go, PFC Kyle. Move your ass.
CHRIS: You okay? Jeff?
JEFF: I heard you're kickin ass our here. All the guys, that's what they say

JEFF: Fuck this place
CHRIS: ( can't hear him ) Fuck this place.
JEFF: Fuck this place.
COL. JONES: You made Chief. Congratulations.
CHRIS KYLE: Thank you, sir.
COL. JONES: Gronski's gone. A lot of top-brass are. We're working off a new playbook now.
COL. JONES: I've studied insurgencies for the last decade. I know every stone thrown since before the first century. These wars are won and lost in the minds of our enemy.
COL. JONES: That you?
COL. JONES: You're now the most wanted man in Iraq.
CHRIS KYLE: Don't tell my wife, she might take that number right about now.
COL. JONES: I understand you wanted to put together a direct-action squad to hunt The Butcher.
CHRIS KYLE: Yes, sir.
COL. JONES: We plugged the rat-hole that is Fallujah and flushed them into Ramadi. We got some intel indicating his area of operations.
COL. JONES: I want you to put the fear of God in these savages, and find his ass.
CHRIS: You guys know how I hate this shit so shut your traps. Our target is Amir Khalaf Fanus aka The Butcher. We'll be heading in under cover of darkness, sector P13, north of the river
TIME FADE: Brief finished, TEAM THREE file out past Chris
BIGGLES: You give good power-point, Legend.
MARC LEE: Is this thing bulletproof? You never open it so I assumed.
CHRIS KYLE: God, country, family, right?
MARC LEE: You got a God?
CHRIS KYLE: You getting weird on me?
MARC LEE: We had this electric fence around our property in Oregon and us kids used to see who could grab it and hang on the longest. War feels like that, it puts lightning in your bones, makes it hard to hold on to anything else.
CHRIS KYLE: You need to sit this one out?
MARC LEE: I just wanna believe in what we're doing
CHRIS KYLE: Evil lives here, we've seen it.
MARC LEE: It lives everywhere
CHRIS KYLE: You want to invite these motherfuckers to come fight in San Diego? Or New York? We're protecting more than this dirt.

CHRIS: They serve more customers than McDonalds.
BIGGLES: They serve more customers than McDonalds.
MARC LEE: And check this.
CHRIS: He still inside?
MARC LEE: I'm only clocking one point of entry. He's in there, but it's no easy breach.
BIGGLES: When they see it's The Legend they'll probably just invite him in
CHRIS: You got a problem? I didn't promote No, I did it for you. You'd never have made Chief if I nicknamed you "The Myth".
BIGGLES: No, I did it for you. You'd never have made Chief if I nicknamed you "The Myth".
"D": Myth becomes Legend when we occupy a house, get 23 kills, and 21 are his.
TONY: Enough. It's everybody's Navy.
BIGGLES: naw, it's Legend's Navy now. Just hope he leaves some for the rest of us.
CHRIS: Hash out tactics. We go at zero-dark. And Big Giggles is making the coffee.
TERP: ( translates ) He invites you to join him for Eid al- Adha supper. He says -on this day everyone has a seat at my table-.
CHRIS: Tell him that's very generous of him.
CHRIS: Tell him he's gonna be shipped off for detention and the Iraqi courts can decide what to do with him or he can help us get inside that restaurant down there.
MARC LEE: That's a bad move
BIGGLES: He's our breech. He's a fucking way in
MARC LEE: If something happens

NEXT INTERSECTION: As Chris arrives, the GETAWAY TRUCK roars past a block to the north. He continues at a dead-sprint but At next intersection, he's lost more ground. He halts, sucking wind, GALLIC CROSS TATTOO visible on his forearm.
CHRIS: ( can't take eyes off son ) I offered his father detention. I gave him a choice
PFC ALVAREZ: Sir, we have armed insurgents moving this way. We need to make tracks.
CHRIS KYLE: Tell him this boy's father was fighting for the people that butchered the clerics we found in the freezer in there.
DISTANT ALLEY: A flutter of robes. A rusty gate pushed open by an OLD MAN. Mustafa slips past, brushing the man's shoulder in thanks. Breath in cadence with step, his head turns up Smoke plumes into night, their signal leading him ahead.
TERP: - This is our territory. If you want to come here, you ask me. If you want to find someone, I find them-
CHRIS KYLE: ( to Tribal Leader ) If I ask for your help you're the one they carve up next. I've seen it happen.
ALLEY: TWO MEN stand by a 12 foot wall. A dark shape sprints toward them. One man kneels, the other braces him. The reflective swoosh catches light as Mustafa runs up the man's back, leaping onto the wall.
TERP: -I am the seventh son of Isaac of Abraham. This is the land of my father, and I am not afraid.- He says your evil is greater than those you fight. He calls you white satan, devil of Ramadi.
NEARBY ROOFTOP: Nikes cross gravel. Mustafa kneels. Unfolds his bi-pod.

YOUNG MAN: Sorry to intrude, sir, but we met in Fallujah. You saved my life.
CHRIS: Did I?
CHRIS: ( lifetimes ago, but ) Yeah. Right. Well, you Marines saved our ass plenty out there. How you holding up?
MADS: It cost lots of guys more than a leg.
CHRIS: Did you lose some friends?
MADS: That too, but I'm talking about guys that lived. They made it back but they're just not back. They can't seem to get right.
CHRIS: Yeah, I I'm sorry to hear that.
MADS: You should come down to the VA sometime. The guys would love it. They all know who The Legend is.
MADS: I bet you missed your daddy when he was gone. But can I tell you something? Your dad is a hero. He saved my life He helped me get home to my little girl.
MADS: So thank you for loaning him to us, li'l man. I wouldn't be here without him.

"D": The Butcher is building a 7-11?
MARC LEE: No ammo, no jihad.

BIGGLES: How the hell'd he make that?
CHRIS: He didn't
BIGGLES: So much for leading us to the Butcher.
CHRIS: So much for him having my horseshoe.
DISTANT BALUSTRADE: MUSTAFA lays prone, mumbles a prayer and takes two deep breaths before putting his eye to the scope.
CHRIS: She'll take it to Zales and try to find out how much your spent.
BIGGLES: She's not like that.
CHRIS: They're all like that.
BIGGLES: It's giant, bro. Four karats. It had to belong to one of Saddam's bitches

BIGGLES: ( gargled ) I'm got it. I got it I can walk

CHRIS: You got nothing to be sorry for. I shouldn't have had us up there
BIGGLES: Am I gonna die?

BIGGLES: Not you. Not the Legend. You lucky fuck
CHRIS: Don't die, Ryan. You hold on

CHRIS: He was 1000 meters out. Only one enemy sniper makes that shot.
COL. JONES: Will he make it?
DAUBER: Doesn't look good, Master Chief.
"D": The sun high.
COL. JONES: A Shi'a cab driver we source is saying there's a stronghold seven doors down.

CHRIS: CHRIS is staggered but his training takes over and he steps into the same window, BLASTING FIRE. DAUBER is trying to intubate Marc but the back of his head is gone. He was dead before he hit the wall.
TAYA: Marc wrote that letter two weeks ago. Did he say any of that to you?
TAYA: Chris? I want to know what you thought of his letter.
CHRIS: ( slow, absent ) An AQI informant called in a tip. Biggles had just been shot. We were operating off emotion and we walked into an ambush.
CHRIS: But that's not what killed him. That letter did. That letter killed Marc. He let go and he paid the price for it.
CHRIS: If something ever happened to me you'd meet someone else. You'd be alright.
TAYA: Do you want to die? Is that what it is?
CHRIS: ( cheeks shine with tears ) Then tell me why do you do it. I want to I do it for you. To protect you.

CHRIS: She wouldn't leave me, bro. I told her to go but she wouldn't leave.
BIGGLES: She wouldn't leave me, bro. I told her to go but she wouldn't leave.
CHRIS: No she's not. How can you say that? She's getting you. All four inches.
BIGGLES: I'm glad this happened to me and not you. No way you could've handled it.
CHRIS: You're probably right.
BIGGLES: They say you're the deadliest sniper in U.S. Military history.
CHRIS: Is that what they say?

CHRIS: That's not me.
DOCTOR: What's not you?
