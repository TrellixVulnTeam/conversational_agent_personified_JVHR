LANGDON: Vatican Police? I was expecting another letter. My request for access to the Archives?
VINCENZO: In fact I was in New York, on vacation. I got a call in the middle of the night - find Robert Langdon. A matter of great urgency.
LANGDON: Urgent Vatican business, involving me? I doubt that.
VINCENZO: They said to show you this.
LANGDON: CUT TO:
VINCENZO: Yes, of course, but it couldn't be the llluminati as we knew them, they disappeared a hundred years ago.
LANGDON: Did they? Look at the paper.
VINCENZO: I've seen it.
LANGDON: Look again.
VINCENZO: "The Art of the llluminati," by Robert
LANGDON: Incredible. Either someone just figured out how to make this, or they found it. Recently. Which would mean the llluminati have returned. An ancient brotherhood, enemies of the church, surfacing just after the death of a Pope? I'd pull you off vacation too.
VINCENZO: It's worse than just that. Four cardinals were kidnapped from their quarters inside the Vatican some time between three and five a.m. this morning. Shortly afterward, the Office of the Swiss Guard received that document, along with the threat that the Cardinals will be publicly executed, one per hour, starting at seven p.m. tonight, in Rome.

VINCENZO: Was to begin today. We have postponed its start for a few hours, a story of illness, there are no suspicions. Yet.
LANGDON: What do you want from me?
VINCENZO: The perpetrators of this heinous act sent that ambigram, you say? as a provocation, a taunt. But it may also be their undoing. If you can help us learn their identity, perhaps we can stop them.
LANGDON: Why me?
VINCENZO: Your expertise. Your erudition. And your involvement with recent Church shall we say "mysteries?"
LANGDON: I wasn't under the impression that episode had endeared me to the Oh, it didn't. But it made you what is the word? Formidable. Formidable. A plane is standing by twenty minutes from here. Will you come with me?

OLIVETTI: Professor Langdon, welcome to Vatican City. Ernesto Olivetti, Inspector Generale of the Vatican Police Force.
LANGDON: I assumed you were Swiss Guard.
OLIVETTI: No. The Gendarmerie is responsible for everything inside the Vatican walls, with the exception of the security of His Holiness and the Apostolic Palace. That is Swiss Guard. The Commandante Generale of the Roman Carbinieri has joined us as well, in an advisory capacity, and the Guarda Nacionale have sent a So jurisdictionally, this is-
LANGDON: ( CONFUSED ) So jurisdictionally, this is-
OLIVETTI: A God damn nightmare.
LANGDON: The Great Castration.
OLIVETTI: I beg your pardon?
LANGDON: 1857. Pius IX felt the male form might inspire lust, so he got a hammer and chisel and unmanned two hundred statues. These plaster fig leaves were added later.
OLIVETTI: Are you anti-Catholic, Professor Me? No, I'm anti-vandalism.
LANGDON: Me? No, I'm anti-vandalism.
OLIVETTI: I urge you to guard your tone in there. The Swiss Guard is a calling, not a profession, and it encourages a certain zealotry. Commander Rocher, the head of the Guard, is a deeply spiritual man, and he was close to the late Pope. Understood?
LANGDON: ( SINCERE ) I just hope I can help.
OLIVETTI: So do I. You were my idea.
OLIVETTI: Wait here.
ACCENTÂ·: ( to Vittoria ) Ms. Vetra? I'm Commander Rocher, Commandante Principale of the Swiss Guard. Thank you for coming. And Professor Langdon?
ROCHER: ( to Vittoria ) Ms. Vetra? I'm Commander Rocher, Commandante Principale of the Swiss Guard. Thank you for coming. And Professor Langdon?
LANGDON: That's right. Rocher looks him up and down, so, you're Langdon.
ROCHER: Thank God, the symbologist is here. Ms. Vetra, this way, please.
OLIVETTI: There's been a development. We received another threat from the
VITTORIA: ( CONTINUING ) canister was stolen from our lab around midnight last night. The intruder killed my research partner, Leonardo Bentivoglio, and mutilated him in order to bypass security.
ROCHER: I'm quite familiar with incendiaries, Ms. Vetra. I haven't heard of It's new, energy research technology. It uses a reverse polarity vacuum to filter out anti-matter positrons generated in particle accelerations in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

OLIVETTI: It's wireless. It too was stolen. That could be anywhere inside the Vatican walls.
VITTORIA: You've got to find it.
ROCHER: We're a bit preoccupied with four missing cardinals at the moment.
VITTORIA: You don't understand. An annihilation is a cataclysmic event. It would be a blinding explosion, equivalent to about five megatons. The blast radius alone would be
LANGDON: "Vatican City will be consumed by
ROCHER: Those are the exact words the kidnapper used.
LANGDON: It's an ancient llluminati threat. The destruction of Vatican City through light. The four pillars he probably means the kidnapped cardinals. You didn't mention they were the preferiti. The favorites to be chosen as the new Pope. Play it again.
LANGDON: Stop it there.
ROCHER: He said they'd be killed publicly. In Revenge for La Purga.
LANGDON: ( nods, not surprised ) Revenge for La Purga.
ROCHER: La Purga?
LANGDON: Don't you guys read your own history? 1668. The church kidnapped four llluminati scientists and branded their chests with the symbol of the cross. To "purge their sins." Murdered them and left their bodies in the street as a warning to others to stop questioning church rulings on scientific matters. It was after La Purga that a darker, more violent llluminati emerged. This sounds like retribution. Is there any more?
LANGDON: The Path of Illumination?
OLIVETTI: Professor, this is not the appropriate moment to-
ROCHER: Your petition has been denied seven times, Mr. Langdon.
LANGDON: This has nothing to do with that,
ROCHER: Even if I wanted to help you, access is only by written decree of the curator and the Board of Vatican Or by papal mandate.
LANGDON: Or by papal mandate.
ROCHER: Yes. But as you've no doubt heard, the Holy Father is-
LANGDON: What about Il Camerlengo? Let me talk to him.
ROCHER: The Camerlengo? He's just a priest here, the former Pope's Chamberlain.
LANGDON: Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest with him during tempe sede vacante?
CAMERLENGO: His Holiness once told me that a Pope is a man torn between two worlds. the real world and the divine.
ROCHER: Of course, but it could be anywhere, and the safety of the cardinals is my primary concern at the moment.
CAMERLENGO: The Sistine Chapel is a fortress, as long as the cardinals are in conclave, your security concerns are at a minimum. Devote as much of your resources as possible to a search for-
ROCHER: Signore, if you're about to suggest we make a naked-eye search of all of Vatican City, I must-
CAMERLENGO: ( SHARPLY ) Commander. Though I am not His Holiness, when you address me, you are addressing this office. Do you Yes, Padre,
ROCHER: Yes, Padre,
CAMERLENGO: Good. Now you said the image on screen was illuminated by artificial light. May I suggest methodically cutting the power to various sections of the City. When the image on your screen goes dark, you'll have a more specific idea of the device's Ms. Vetra. Besides yourself and your research partner, who knew about your antimatter project?
VITTORIA: Only the director of CERN. But Leonardo kept detailed journals; if he told anyone else about what we were doing, he would have made a note of Do you have these journals?
CAMERLENGO: ( PAUSE ) Do you have these journals?
VITTORIA: I can have them flown here from Geneva in an hour.
CAMERLENGO: Mr. Langdon. You're correct that I may grant you access to the Archives.
LANGDON: Thank you, Padre.
CAMERLENGO: I said you're correct that I may, not that I will. Christianity's most sacred codices are in that archive. Given your recent entanglement with the church I need to ask you a question first.
LANGDON: ( DELICATELY ) Father, I simply believe that religions can often-
CAMERLENGO: I didn't ask if you believe what man says about God, I asked if you believe in God.
LANGDON: I'm an academic. My mind tells me I will never understand God.
CAMERLENGO: And your heart?
LANGDON: Tells me I'm not meant to.
CAMERLENGO: Be delicate with our treasures.
OLIVETTI: The archives are this way.
LANGDON: "A shining star at the end of the Path." My thoughts exactly.
OLIVETTI: ( to Vittoria ) If we find this bomb, can you deactivate it?
VITTORIA: No, but I can change its battery, as long as it has more than five minutes of life. That would give us another twenty-four hours to get it back to
LANGDON: Both. You're a physicist?
VITTORIA: ( NODS ) Bio-entanglement physics. Interconnectivity of life systems.
LANGDON: What are we looking for in the A little book written by Galileo.
VITTORIA: What are we looking for in the A little book written by Galileo.
LANGDON: A little book written by Galileo.
VITTORIA: Galileo was llluminati?
LANGDON: And a devout Catholic. He thought science and religion weren't enemies, but two different languages telling the same story. He wanted like minds to be able to find the Church of Illumination, but he couldn't exactly advertise its location, so he created a coded path. An unknown llluminati master sculpted four statues, each a tribute to one of the four fundamental elements earth, air, fire, water and put them out in public, in churches throughout Rome. Each statue held a clue, pointing to the next. And at the end of the trail was the Church of Illumination.
OLIVETTI: What makes you think he's going to murder the cardinals in the churches?
LANGDON: The llluminati called those four churches by a special name L'Altare di scienza. The altars of science.
VITTORIA: ( making the
CONNECTION ): "Sacrifice them on the altars of science," he said.
LANGDON: Oh. Oh, wow.
OLIVETTI: Vatican Police aren't allowed access to the archives, only Swiss Guard. Lt. Chartrand will meet you inside. I'll be here when you're done.
CAMERLENGO: You've been informed of the new May God's mercy be upon us.
MORTATI: ( NODS ) May God's mercy be upon us.
CAMERLENGO: And the other cardinals?
MORTATI: Await your word.
CAMERLENGO: May I ask your guidance, Padre?
MORTATI: My belief is we should proceed with the sealing of conclave.
CAMERLENGO: At this hour? That would be highly And yet within church law. It's in my power, I've been chosen Great The cruelest honor in Christendom.
MORTATI: And yet within church law. It's in my power, I've been chosen Great The cruelest honor in Christendom.
CAMERLENGO: The cruelest honor in Christendom.
MORTATI: The only ambitions I have are for my church. St. Peter's church, which is under attack at its most vulnerable moment. This is not a coincidence. Is it possible our enemies hope to distract us from our sacred task?
CAMERLENGO: The church will not fall in a day. We may be wise to consider evacuation.
MORTATI: That is exactly what they want, publicity and panic. We must not give them oxygen for the media fire.
CAMERLENGO: What of the safety of the cardinals?
MORTATI: Surely there is not an elector present who values his physical being more than the unbroken leadership of the Holy See.
CAMERLENGO: And the people in St. Peter's Square?
MORTATI: They care as deeply about their church as we do. Their faith will sustain But if their faith does not protect them from an explosion?
CAMERLENGO: But if their faith does not protect them from an explosion?
MORTATI: We're all bound for heaven eventually, are we not?
CAMERLENGO: Spoken like one who has enjoyed the blessings of a long and full life.
MORTATI: Signore, do not confuse the power of the office you temporarily hold with your true place here in the Vatican. You were a favorite of His Holiness, but His Holiness is with his Father Mea culpa.
CAMERLENGO: Mea culpa.
MORTATI: Seal the doors.
CHARTRAND: ( Swiss accent ) The chambers are hermetic vaults, oxygen is kept at lowest possible levels. It's a partial vacuum inside. More than ten minutes in the vault is not recommended without breathing apparatus.

LANGDON: D3. Galileo's third text. Dialogo. Discorsi.
LANGDON: Diagramma della Verita. The Diagram of Truth.
VITTORIA: I know about Dialogo and Discorsi Galileo laid out his theories about the earth revolving around the sun, and the church forced him to recant. But what was this?
LANGDON: This is where he got the word out. The truth, not what the Vatican forced him to write. Smuggled out of Rome and printed in Holland on sedge papyrus. That way any scientists caught with a copy could simply drop it in water and the booklet would dissolve.
VITTORIA: A bit.
LANGDON: Finger acids.
VITTORIA: ( READING ) Movement of the planets. elliptical orbits. heliocentricity.
LANGDON: Do that again.
VITTORIA: English? Why English?
LANGDON: No one spoke it at the Vatican. It was considered polluted. Too free- thinking, the language of radicals like Shakespeare and Chaucer.

LANGDON: Raphael? The sculptor?
VITTORIA: Raphael? The sculptor?
LANGDON: Santi was his last name.

LANGDON: ( not entirely
CONVINCED ): Raphael is buried at the Pantheon.

ROCHER: I've just pulled a dozen of my best men from Vatican City during conclave and left the search for the antimatter device in the hands of secondary officers. You'd better be right.

ROCHER: The Pantheon is one of the busiest tourist spots in Rome, how could he hope to get away with it? It's As impossible as kidnapping four cardinals from Vatican City? The poem is precise.
LANGDON: As impossible as kidnapping four cardinals from Vatican City? The poem is precise.
ROCHER: The poem. Unbelievable. I'm basing this operation on an American's interpretation of a four hundred year old poem.
VITTORIA: The information we have clearly refers to Raphael's tomb, and Raphael's tomb is inside that building.
LANGDON: The Pantheon is your one chance to catch this guy.
ROCHER: One? I thought you said four. A pathway, four markers. We'll have four chances to catch him.
LANGDON: You would have, a hundred years ago. The Vatican had all the pagan statues in the Pantheon removed and destroyed in the late 1800s. Whatever marker was there to lead us to the next church is gone now. The path is dead. This is your chance.
ROCHER: Separate approaches. Cars to Piazza della Rotunda, Via degli Orfani, Piazza Sant'Ignazio, and Sant1Eustachio. No closer than two blocks, no uniforms, three minutes.
VITTORIA: Wait a minute, you'll scare him off.
ROCHER: They're not in uniform.

VITTORIA: You're saying Christianity is repackaged sun worship?

LANGDON: What are you talking about?!

LANGDON: I don't know. Urbino, I think. Santi's earthly tomb. what else could it possibly. Santi 's tomb.
DOCENT: Does anyone have any questions?
LANGDON: Yes! Did Raphael Santi ever design a chapel with an ossuary annex and angel figure commissioned by the Catholic Church?!
DOCENT: I'm sorry, I. I can only think of
LANGDON: One'll do.
ROCHER: Wrong? What do you mean, wrong?!
LANGDON: ( FAST ) The first altar of science is the Chigi Chapel, in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, about a mile from here! It used to be called Capella della Terra, Chapel of the Earth. Earth, the first element! This is it, I'm certain.
ROCHER: You were certain of the Pantheon.
LANGDON: Please, we have four minutes!
VITTORIA: Back to the Vatican?! You can't!
LANGDON: Commandante, if you care at all about your church-

LANGDON: This is the place.
VITTORIA: The Freemasons? Are Illuminati?
LANGDON: The Illuminati were infiltrators. There isn't a powerful organization on earth they didn't place members in. Look at a dollar bill some time. A pyramid, an occult symbol representing convergence upward, with the eye of illumination above it, and beneath it the Latin for "New World Order."
VITTORIA: The United States government was infiltrated by Illuminati?
LANGDON: FDR's vice-president was a high- ranking Freemason. Convinced him the words in Latin actually meant "New
OLIVETTI: Eight o'clock!

LANGDON: I made a mistake.
VITTORIA: Is it Raphael?
LANGDON: The chapel is. But the sculptures are Bernini.
VITTORIA: Didn't he work for the Church?
LANGDON: Almost exclusively. It means the Illuminati even infiltrated the Vatican. They hid in plain sight.

ROCHER: You're sure this time?
LANGDON: I need a map. One that shows all the churches in Rome.
LANGDON: The black rectangles with crosses are churches, and none of them intersect the line until it comes to an end, right in the middle of St. Peter's
ROCHER: Your theory doesn't hold up, Professor. Michelangelo designed St. Peter's, not Bernini.
LANGDON: The Basilica is Michelangelo, but the square is Bernini. The second marker must be a statue in the square.
VITTORIA: It's ten minutes till nine! Can we go any faster?!
ROCHER: Not unless we want the full attention of the world press.
LANGDON: Another obelisk. We're close.
VITTORIA: There must be a hundred statues up there, which one is it?
LANGDON: How in God's name would anyone make a sculpture about air?
NEARBY,: a LITTLE GIRL dances with a doll. Happily unaware of what's going on.

NEARBY,: the Little Girl is jostled by a HOMELESS MAN, drops her doll.
VITTORIA: He's still alive!
ROCHER: Clear the square.
CAMERLENGO: When did this call come in?
OLIVETTI: Three, four minutes ago. The same voice as on the tape. We're analyzing the accent now, Alsatian is our best guess at the moment.
CAMERLENGO: And he actually claimed responsibility for the death of His Holiness?
OLIVETTI: Not personally, but he said it was the Illuminati. He said they murdered That's ridiculous, the Holy Father died of a stroke. Did he say how they claim to have done it?
CAMERLENGO: That's ridiculous, the Holy Father died of a stroke. Did he say how they claim to have done it?
OLIVETTI: The Pope's own medication. A drug known as Heparin?
VITTORIA: The Pope took Heparin?
CAMERLENGO: He had thrombophlebitis. He took an injection once a day. But no one knew that.
OLIVETTI: Someone knew.
ROCHER: His Holiness had health concerns; he was subject to seizures as well. But he took steps to make sure he was watched. For safety. That's all he wished to be made public, and that's all we should discuss.
VITTORIA: ( ignoring him ) Heparin is lethal in the wrong dosage. An overdose would cause massive internal bleeding and brain hemorrhages. At first it might look like a stroke, but in a few days his body would show signs, we could easily-
ROCHER: Ms. Vetra, in case you're unaware, papal autopsies are prohibited by Vatican Law. We are not about to defile His Holiness's body just because his enemies claim to-
CAMERLENGO: Of course we're not. We'll make a public announcement refuting this absurd claim.
FR. SIMEON: I'm afraid that's out of the question. Cardinal Mortati has insisted this entire matter be kept internal.
CAMERLENGO: Cardinal Mortati shouldn't even be aware of this, he's locked in His final instructions before sealing the doors were very clear no outside communications unless absolutely Cardinal Mortati will remember that he is Dean of the College of Cardinals, not His Holiness himself.

CAMERLENGO: Cardinal Mortati will remember that he is Dean of the College of Cardinals, not His Holiness himself.
FR. SIMEON: As you say. Yet, technically, now that Conclave has begun, it is his privilege and duty to control public announcements. I've drafted a short release about the incident in the square, but any other statements are specifically prohibited. For that, the Cardinal has asked me to remind you we have a chimney.
CAMERLENGO: As you say. Commander Rocher, the search for the We've turned the power off and on to about twenty percent of Vatican City. Nothing on the video yet.
ROCHER: We've turned the power off and on to about twenty percent of Vatican City. Nothing on the video yet.
CAMERLENGO: Mr. Langdon, you've been right so far, if belatedly, about the Path. It's now nine fifteen, how quickly can you find the next church?
LANGDON: The line of the breath in the carving points due east, directly away from Vatican City, but there are five lines, so there's room for error.
CAMERLENGO: ( to Olivetti ) Escort him.
VITTORIA: The journals I asked for. I'd like to stay here and study them. If Leonardo told anyone else about our project, that could be the killer.
CAMERLENGO: The group starts to break up, half of them headed for the doors. As Langdon rolls up the map on the desk, the Camerlengo notices his black clothes for the first time.
LANGDON: It would surprise the hell out of me.

CHARTRAND: What are you looking for this time?
LANGDON: I beg your pardon?
CHARTRAND: I beg your pardon?
LANGDON: Artwork is valuable, and corporations tend to keep track of their holdings.
CHARTRAND: The Catholic Church is not a corporation, Signore, it is a beacon, a source of inspiration for one billion lost and frightened souls.
LANGDON: Sure sure, I get that.
CHARTRAND: Cfmmander Olivetti said I was not to leave your side this time.
LANGDON: ( a mutter ) Wasn't me, it was her,
BAM!: A book drops onto a table, pages flip by, Langdon studies it, SLAMS it shut.
CAMERLENGO: What sort of signs?
VITTORIA: I'm sorry?
CAMERLENGO: If the Holy Father were given an overdose of Heparin. what signs would his body bear?
VITTORIA: Bleeding of the oral mucosa. His gums. Postmortem, the blood congeals and turns the inside of the mouth black.
CAMERLENGO: Even though he died fourteen days ago?
VITTORIA: It wouldn't show up until at least a week after his death.
CAMERLENGO: He was. very important to me.
VITTORIA: I understand.
CAMERLENGO: Please come.
LANGDON: You don't smoke, do you?
CHARTRAND: ( yes, a lot ) A little bit.
LANGDON: Sit down before you fall down.
CHARTRAND: "Moved at suggestion of the artist."
LANGDON: Moved to another church? At Bernini"s suggestion?
CHARTRAND: I don't know.
THE STATUE: is of a woman, seemingly in the throes of ecstasy, while an angel hovering over her holds a spear aloft.
LANGDON: More words pop out at us "His great golden spear. filled with Still more "woman inflamed by passion's fire."
LANGDON: And now three things happen in quick succession:
CHARTRAND: That's too bad.
LANGDON: That's too bad.
VITTORIA: Where are we going?
CAMERLENGO: To see my father.
VITTORIA: I don't understand.
CAMERLENGO: I was orphaned when I was nine years old. A bombing in Madrid Basque separatists protesting the visit of a Catholic archbishop.
VITTORIA: He died?
CAMERLENGO: ( NODS ) Fourteen days ago.
LANGDON: Chartrand gestures weakly around the room.
CHARTRAND: Walls. lead-lined. no signal.
LANGDON'S HAND: slips the gun out of the holster and hefts it. Safe bet he's never held one of these before.
CAMERLENGO: If the Holy Father was murdered, the implications are profound. Vatican security is impenetrable, no one from the outside could have gotten anywhere near him.
VITTORIA: Meaning it was someone on the inside.
CAMERLENGO: We can trust no one
CAMERLENGO: Father. Holy Father. You told me when I was young that the voice in my heart was that of God. You told me I must follow it no matter what painful places it leads. I hear it now, asking me the impossible. Give me strength. Forgive me. What I do, I do in the name of everything you
BEHIND HIM,: the others watch as he finishes his private prayer, stands, and turns to them.
SWISS GUARDSMAN: Signore, by law we are at your command. But we are also bound by-
CAMERLENGO: I ask your forgiveness for putting you in this position. Vatican laws are established to protect the church. But it is in that very spirit that I command you to break them now.
LANGDON: Are you out of your minds?!
OLIVETTI: Please. In the car.
LANGDON: Someone tried to kill me.
OLIVETTI: Do you know where the next church is?
LANGDON: Then get in the car!
OLIVETTI: Then get in the car!
OLIVETTI: We had no idea that
LANGDON: You heard me ask permission! You assigned me an escort! Don't try to tell me you didn't know I was in Of course I knew, but we had no idea that portions of our white zones are
OLIVETTI: ( let me finish ) Of course I knew, but we had no idea that portions of our white zones are
LANGDON: Or there is the other possibility.
OLIVETTI: ( AGONIZED ) I want to speak to the Camerlengo.
LANGDON: I want to speak to the Camerlengo.
OLIVETTI: Il Camerlengo is unavailable,
LANGDON: Unavailable? Why?
OLIVETTI: He's found evidence that the Holy Father was indeed murdered. He is seeking guidance.
LANGDON: From whom?
OLIVETTI: From God.
LANGDON: Oh, right.
OLIVETTI: Please. Make an effort.
VITTORIA: The journals. Where are they?
CAMERLENGO: Unseal the doors.
MORTATI: Signore, do you realize that for the first time in Vatican history, a Camerlengo has just crossed the sacred threshold of conclave after sealing the doors?
CAMERLENGO: There has been a development.
CAMERLENGO: Please. a moment. if I.
LANGDON: Oh no.
CAMERLENGO: Since the days of Galileo, the church has tried to slow the relentless march of science, sometimes with misguided means, but always with benevolent intention. Still, they call us backward, ignorant.
CAMERLENGO: The promises of science have not been kept. We're a fractured and frantic species, moving down of destruction in the name of progress.
CAMERLENGO: Science and religion are not enemies. But there are things that science is simply too young to understand. We are here to lead, but how?
CAMERLENGO: Shall we cloak ourselves in silence and secrecy, as in the past? Or do we open the doors, take down the blackened curtains, and speak to our
CAMERLENGO: Signores, I ask, no, I pray that you break this conclave. Open the
CAMERLENGO: Evacuate St. Peter's Square.
CAMERLENGO: Tell the world the truth.
LANGDON: The cleat, on the wall! Get something to stand on!
NEARBY,: Vatican Cop 4 is desperately trying to pull the Cardinal from the flames, the end of the candle-snuffer is now hooked around the Cardinal's foot, he pulls him closer, reaches out, can almost grab his ankle
NEARBY,: Langdon, still on the ground, looks up at the sound of the shots. Through the burning church pews he can see Mr. Gray, starting toward him.
MR. GRAY: ( good Italian accent ) Gendarmeria Vaticano!
UNDERGROUND,: Langdon CRUNCHES to a hard landing on a subterranean stone floor, rolls over, and sees Mr. Gray above him, now pointing down.
MORTATI: My son. God answers all prayers.
MORTATI: The College will not break conclave.
CAMERLENGO: We can't hide this anymore. The burning church
MORTATI: A despicable act of terrorism. Father Simeon will make a suitable announcement lamenting the loss of life. May I suggest you direct your energies to helping the Swiss Guard confront the possibility of this explosive device, and leave church
FR. SIMEON: Eminence. There is a growing fear that without the four prefiriti, a two- thirds majority for any candidate may be impossible. Unless
MORTATI: Speak plainly.

ROCHER: This isn't Italy. It isn't even Rome. The Vatican is its own country, with its own laws, and when those journals crossed our border they became our property. You will get them back when I have decided they contain nothing of value to this

ROMAN COP: Direction? West, I think. Mr. Langdon, we've confirmed with the Vatican that they invited you into this investigation, but what I-
LANGDON: A MOMENT LATER, as if by command, a map CRINKLES out on the floor of the church. It's detailed, a fire department map, and Langdon drops down on all fours, studying it.
LANGDON: We're here. Piazza Barberini.
LANGDON: Damn it.
ROMAN COP: Professor, I need to know what you saw Fire and death. Show me where Santa Maria del Popolo is.
LANGDON: Fire and death. Show me where Santa Maria del Popolo is.

ROMAN COP: Professor! The Vatican insists that-

FRENCH REPORTER: as conclave goes on, with no sign of agreement on a new pope yet.
CAMERLENGO: At 11:15, if the church is still in peril, give the order to evacuate the cardinals. But with dignity, let them exit into St. Peter's Square, with their heads held high. I don't want the last image of this church to be frightened old men sneaking out a back door. If Cardinal Mortati protests, escort him bodily. Do you
SWISS GUARDSMAN: If you think it is the right thing, I'm certain it's the wrong thing, and I will be removed from my post for it. But I also know we have no choice.
CAMERLENGO: I'm certain it's the wrong thing, and I will be removed from my post for it. But I also know we have no choice.

SURFACE,: takes a deep breath, then plunges back
UNDERWATER,: but he still can't move the Cardinal.
UNDERWATER,: Langdon drags the body of the Cardinal a few feet across the bottom of the fountain and RIPS the tube free from its mooring, pulling it to the Cardinal's mouth.
LANGDON: Cardinale Guidera?
CARDINAL GU: The Church of Illumination. It's where you were being held, isn't it?
LANGDON: The Church of Illumination. It's where you were being held, isn't it?
CARDINAL GUIDERA: Castel. Sant'Angelo.
CHARTRAND: Langdon says Cardinal Guidera will be killed in Piazza Navona. He's on his way there with two Carbinieri.
ROCHER: Send everyone we can spare.
CHARTRAND: Staying here to continue the search for the explosive.
ROCHER: Staying here to continue the search for the explosive.
LANGDON: You're all right?
VITTORIA: I'm all right, what about you?!
LANGDON: Cold and wet but alive. Where's I don't know. He took the journals, he's hiding something.
VITTORIA: I don't know. He took the journals, he's hiding something.
LANGDON: This is it. The Church of Illumination is somewhere in the
LANGDON: The Vatican used this place for centuries as a hideout, a prison for enemies of the church there are passages and catacombs everywhere. It makes sense, the Illuminati infiltrated the Church's own stronghold. Bernini was chief architect here, he left clues everywhere, it's even surrounded by a pentagonal park!
LANGDON: A traforo. Commanders on horseback used them to ride directly into a castle from the outside.
LANGDON: It's a dead end.
VITTORIA: Back to search the outer castle.
LANGDON: No. no, it has to be here!
VITTORIA: Robert, it's a dead end.
LANGDON: Bring a flashlight.
LANGDON: Do you still have the gun?
VITTORIA: You told me to give it back.
LANGDON: Ignore me any time you like.
VITTORIA: An angel.
ROCHER: Get on the radio and put the word out. Conclave is to remain sealed.

ROCHER: I'm countermanding it.
SWISS GUARDSMAN: That door stays SHUT! Do you Yes sir.
ROCHER: That door stays SHUT! Do you Yes sir.
SWISS GUARDSMAN: Yes sir.
VITTORIA: We have thirty minutes left, I can still change the battery if we can find the cannister.
LANGDON: There's a fifth brand.
VITTORIA: He touches the indentation in the velvet, puzzling it out.
LANGDON: Two crossed keys.
VITTORIA: The symbol for the Vatican?
LANGDON: The papacy.
VITTORIA: But there is no pope.
LANGDON: Technically, there is.

I?: He picks up his briefcase.
LANGDON: Why didn't you kill us when you had the chancer
MR. GRAY: Because no one asked me to.
LANGDON: We've got to get to the Vatican.
SWISS GUARDSMAN: The Camerlengo says he will grant you an audience.
ROCHER: I'd like to see him alone.
SWISS GUARDSMAN: That's impossible, sir. No one-
ROCHER: Have you forgotten who you work for?!
SWISS GUARDSMAN: No, sir.
CAMERLENGO: Have you come to make me a martyr?
VITTORIA: Men of God.
FURTHER AHEAD,: they plow onward, and now there is a low ROARING sound from above them. Langdon pauses, looks up.
LANGDON: We're under St. Peter's Square.
FR. SIMEON: I demand to speak to the Camerlengo.
UP AHEAD,: they turn a corner and, without warning - the tunnel ends.
LANGDON: Senza chiave! A one-way portal, the only access is from the other side!
LANGDON: The Camerlengo is in danger!
CAMERLENGO: FR. SIMEON
ILLUMINATUS!: FR. SIMEON
FR. SIMEON: You bastard! You sanctimonious-
ROCHER: For safety.
CHARTRAND: I need a Medevac to St. Peter's Square, right now!
CAMERLENGO: Order the evacuation. We only have nineteen minutes.
LANGDON: ( POINTING ) The keys. They're upside down.
VITTORIA: You think it's a sign?
LANGDON: Everything has been a sign, why should this be any different?
CAMERLENGO: St. Peter.
LANGDON: ( YES ) The first pope, he was crucified upside-down, on Vatican Hill. Right beneath where we're standing.
CAMERLENGO: "Upon this rock I will build my Or bring it down upon itself.

LANGDON: The Necropolis. City of the dead.
CAMERLENGO: It must be here! It must be!
VITTORIA: Set it down flat.
LANGDON: What's wrong?
VITTORIA: Heat decreases battery life. We may have less than five minutes.

LANGDON: Father, please!

LANGDON: There it is!
LANGDON: Oh my God.
ABOVE HIM,: the helicopter continues to climb, far up into the night.
SWISS GUARDSMAN: Signore Mortati, he is alive! The Camerlengo is alive!
MORTATI: Praise God.
LANGDON: Are you okay?
VITTORIA: Do we have time for that story now?
LANGDON: Do I have someone to tell it to?
MORTATI: Signores. you are no doubt aware that by Holy Law the man is ineligible for election to the papacy. He is not a cardinal, he is a priest, a chamberlain. And there is the matter of his inadequate age. I'm sorry, the protocols of conclave are not subject to modification. I will not call a ballot on this matter.
AFRICAN CARDINAL: But Signore, you would not call the ballot. Surely you remember you gave up your post as Great Elector.
SECOND CARDINAL: They are singing in St. Peter's Square! What happened here tonight transcends our laws!
MORTATI: Does it? Is it God's will that we abandon reason and give ourselves over to frenzy? Discard the rules of the
THIRD CARDINAL: Perhaps they need not be discarded.
MORTATI: "Acclimation by Adoration."
THIRD CARDINAL: Si, signore!
SECOND CARDINAL: Of course! Election by Adoration occurs when all the cardinals, as if by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, freely and spontaneously, unanimously and aloud, proclaim one individual's name.
THIRD CARDINAL: And the law states that Adoration supersedes all other eligibility requirements. The candidate need only be an ordained member of the He must be present in the Sistine Chapel at the moment of election.
BUT!: ( they listen ) He must be present in the Sistine Chapel at the moment of election.
SWISS GUARDSMAN: Please wait here while we arrange your transportation. May I get you
LANGDON: What are you doing?
VITTORIA: Leonardo's journals. I want them
LANGDON: Wait a minute.
ROCHER: For safety.
ROCHER: The Holy Father was subject to seizures. but he took steps.
ROCHER: For safety.
LANGDON: For safety.
VITTORIA: Where's that?
LANGDON: That.is the papal office.
LANGDON: The Pope spent a lot of time in contemplation, alone. If he was worried about seizures, he must have asked Rocher to install a camera without telling anyone. To keep an eye on him. For safety. And
CAMERLENGO: The scientist kept journals? So?
ROCHER: You figure prominently in them.
CAMERLENGO: Leonardo wasn't just a physicist, he was a Catholic priest. Deeply conflicted about the implications of his work and in need of spiritual guidance. About a month ago, he requested an audience with the Pope. But you'd know that, because you granted the audience, and were present during it.

CAMERLENGO: The fool thought he had duplicated the moment of creation.
ROCHER: And the Holy Father urged him to go public. His Holiness thought the discovery might actually prove the existence of a divine power begin to bridge the gap between religion and Science. The new God. Ignore the weapons and chaos and madness.
CAMERLENGO: Science. The new God. Ignore the weapons and chaos and madness.

CAMERLENGO: He raised me to protect the church. Even from within.
ROCHER: So you brought an old enemy back from the dead to frighten people.
CAMERLENGO: Nothing unites hearts like the presence of evil.
ROCHER: It didn't work, Father.
CAMERLENGO: It isn't finished.
ROCHER: I've informed Father Simeon of what I learned and he'll get word to the Cardinals the moment conclave opens.
CAMERLENGO: I was planning on doing this alone.

MORTATI: It's said he was a doctor.
LANGDON: Is that a message? Science and faith all in one?
