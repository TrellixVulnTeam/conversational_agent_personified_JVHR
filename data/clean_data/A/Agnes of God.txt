EVE: They want a woman.
LYON: All you have to do is meet with her once or twice... then tell the court she's insane.
MARTHA: Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
EVE: Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
MARTHA: Eve, she strangled a baby!
EVE: Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
LEVEAU: We're not telling you what to decide Martha. We're not even telling you to take this.
LYON: Is there any reason why you feel you shouldn't take it?
MARTHA: Today's my birthday. I always make bad decisions on my birthday.
SECRETARY (V.O.): Hi, it's Helen, calling to tell you that Mrs Davenport phoned to confirm her appointment at nine o'clock tomorrow, okay? Bye bye.
SECRETARY (V.O.): Hi, Marty it's Helen again. I cancelled your Wednesday afternoon appointment so you can visit with your mother. Bye bye.
MARTHA: Bonjour, I'm Doctor Martha Livingston, I... MARTHA (Cont.) Hello... I'm Doctor Martha Living...ston... I...
MOTHER MIRIAM: You can call me Sister.
MOTHER MIRIAM: You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
MARTHA: You were a smoker?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Two packs a day.
MARTHA: I can beat that.
MARTHA: Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
MARTHA: How did she hide it from the other nuns?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
MARTHA: How did she hide it during the day?
MARTHA: Didn't she have any physical examinations
MOTHER MIRIAM: We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
MARTHA: Who was the father?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I haven't a clue.
MARTHA: What man had access to her?
MOTHER MIRIAM: None as far as I know.
MARTHA: Was there a priest?
MARTHA: What's his name?
MARTHA: Could there have been anyone else?
MARTHA: And you didn't try to find out who?
MARTHA: Why haven't you asked her?
MOTHER    MIRIAM: Yes, but that was some    ten months ago. I fail to see that the    identity of that somebody has anything    to do with this trial.
MARTHA: Why do you think that?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
MARTHA: The science of psychiatry.
MOTHER MIRIAM: And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are! I don't want that mind cut open.
AGNES: I don't know.
MARTHA: Anything... may I sit down?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: First thing that comes to your mind?
AGNES: God!    But there's nothing to say about God.
MARTHA: Second thing that comes to your mind.
AGNES: Love.
MARTHA: Have you ever loved anyone?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Who?
AGNES: Everyone.
MARTHA: Well, who in particular?
AGNES: Right now?
MARTHA: Uh huh.
AGNES: I love you.
MARTHA: (a pause) Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
AGNES: Yes.
AGNES: (chuckles) Oh, there are so many.
MARTHA: Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
AGNES: Oh, yes!
MARTHA: Do you think he loves you?
AGNES: Oh, I know he does.
MARTHA: He's told you?
AGNES: No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
MARTHA: You've been alone together?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Often?
AGNES: At least once a week.
MARTHA: And you like that?
AGNES: Oh, yes.
MARTHA: Where do you meet?
AGNES: (obviously) In the confessional.
MARTHA: Agnes, do ever see Father Martineau outside the...
AGNES: You want to talk about the baby don't you?
MARTHA: Would you like to talk about it?
AGNES: I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
MARTHA: Why should they?
AGNES: I don't know.
MARTHA: Do you remember the night they said it came?
AGNES: No. I was sick.
MARTHA: How were you sick?
AGNES: Something I ate.
MARTHA: Did it hurt?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Where?
AGNES: Down... there.
MARTHA: And what did you do?
AGNES: I went to my room.
MARTHA: And what happened?
AGNES: I got sicker.
MARTHA: Then let's talk about something else...
MARTHA: Would you like to ask them?
MARTHA: Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
AGNES: What's your real name?
MARTHA: Martha Louise Livingston.
MARTHA: No.
AGNES: Would you like to be?
MARTHA: Not at the moment, no.
AGNES: Do you have any children?
MARTHA: No.
AGNES: Would you like some?
MARTHA: I can't have them any more.
AGNES: Why not?
MARTHA: (a pause) I've stopped menstruating
AGNES: Why do you smoke?
MARTHA: Does it bother you?
AGNES: No questions.
MARTHA: Smoking is an    obsession with me. Maybe one day    I'll become obsessed with something    else, then I'll stop smoking... Do    you have any more questions?
AGNES: One.
MARTHA: What?
AGNES: Where do you think babies come from?
AGNES: Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes. AGNES (Cont.) Mummy wasn't very happy when she died ... and, I think she went to hell because every time I see her she looks like she just stepped out of a hot shower, and I... I'm never sure if it's her, or the Lady who tells me things! They fight over me all the time. (staring into space) The Lady... I saw when I was ten. I was lying on the grass, looking at the sun, and the sun became a cloud, and the cloud became, a Lady. And she told me she would talk to me. And then... her feet began to bleed and I saw there... there were holes in her hands and in her side. And I tried to catch the blood as it fell from the sky, but I couldn't see any more because my eyes hurt because there were big black spots in front of them. And she tells me things like, like... right now she's crying Marie! Marie! ... but I don't know what that means. AGNES (Cont.) ... and... she uses me to sing, it's as if she's throwing a big hook through the air and it catches me under my ribs and tries to pull me up, and I... I can't move because Mommy's holding my feet and all I can do is sing in her voice... it's the Lady's voice, God loves you!
MARTHA: Do you know a Marie?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Well... what do you think? Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
MARTHA: What's your opinion?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I believe Agnes is different.
MARTHA: How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
MARTHA: (lights a cigarette)
MARTHA: If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She didn't! This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
MARTHA: So, someone else could have done it.
MOTHER MIRIAM: No... not in the eyes of the police.
MARTHA: And in your eyes?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I've already told you what I thought.
MARTHA: That she was unconscious, yes! So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
MOTHER MIRIAM: You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
MARTHA: It's possible isn't it?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who?
MARTHA: One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
???: (answers in French)
???: The housekeeper indicates she should enter and walks back
MAMA: Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
MARTHA: It's your favourite...
MAMA: Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
MARTHA: I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
MAMA: Not any more... now I like chocolate.
MAMA: You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
MARTHA: Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
MARTHA: I... I'm Martha, Mama.
SISTER ANNE: The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
MARTHA: Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
SISTER ANNE: No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
MARTHA: Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
MARTHA (V.O.): This was before her pregnancy?
MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.): About two years before.
AGNES: No.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Through someone else?
AGNES: Yes.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who?
AGNES: I can't say.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why?
AGNES: She'd punish me.
MOTHER MIRIAM: One of the other Sisters?
AGNES: No.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who? MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.) Why would she tell you to do this?
AGNES: Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
MOTHER MIRIAM: (genuinely distressed) That's not what he meant.
AGNES: I...    I am a little child but my body keeps    getting bigger and soon I... I won't    be able to fit in, I... I won't be able    to squeeze into Heaven.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
AGNES: No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh my dear child.
AGNES: (standing) God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who?
AGNES: Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
AGNES: But she watches... she listens.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
AGNES: I'm not hungry.
MOTHER MIRIAM: You've got to eat something Agnes.
AGNES: No I don't... the host is enough.
MOTHER MIRIAM: My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
AGNES: I'm being punished.
MARTHA: Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
MOTHER MIRIAM: It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
MARTHA: She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand! She could have bled to death.
FATHER MARTINEAU: Yes...
FATHER MARTINEAU: Speak up, I can hardly hear you.
MARTHA: I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
LYON: Well the bishop will be very upset about this.
MARTHA: I'm fighting for this woman's life, not some bloody bishop.
MARTHA: You liked Sister Paul?
AGNES: She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
AGNES: She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that. AGNES (Cont.) She lived here for almost seventy years. Every day she'd ring the bell, wake us up, call us to God. She took me to my secret place.
MARTHA: Where's that?... I promise I won't tell, would you take me?
AGNES: No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
AGNES: Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
MARTHA: Like what?
AGNES: I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
MARTHA: Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
MARTHA: Beautiful...
AGNES: And sometimes I get under here... it makes a wonderful sound.
MARTHA: What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
AGNES: Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
MARTHA: It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
AGNES: Where did you go?
MARTHA: Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
AGNES: No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
MARTHA: You have trouble sleeping?
AGNES: I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
MARTHA: What things?
MARTHA: How did she know that?
AGNES: Somebody told her.
MARTHA: Who?
AGNES: I don't know.
MARTHA: Agnes...
AGNES: You'll laugh.
MARTHA: I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
AGNES: An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
MARTHA: Did your mother see angels often?
AGNES: No.
MARTHA: Do you?
AGNES: No.
MARTHA: Do you believe she really saw them?
AGNES: (sitting up) No, but I can never tell her that.
MARTHA: Why not? (no answer) Mmm?
AGNES: She'd get angry.
MARTHA: Is that what she said?
MARTHA: Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
AGNES: I can't help it if I'm stupid.
MARTHA: ... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
MARTHA: ... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
AGNES: I was a mistake.
AGNES: Everything... I don't have children.
AGNES: Don't touch me like that! You don't touch me like that, I know what you want from me, you want to take God away. You should be ashamed, they should lock you up people like you.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Nuns... you hate nuns.
MARTHA: I hate ignorance and stupidity.
MOTHER MIRIAM: The Catholic Church...
MARTHA: I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
MARTHA: How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
MOTHER MIRIAM: It's my affair too.
MARTHA: How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
MOTHER MIRIAM: I'm only interested...
MOTHER MIRIAM: She is not a child.
MARTHA: And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...
MOTHER MIRIAM: ???     (distorted)
MARTHA: ??? (distorted) ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. (she sits)
MARTHA: Then help her.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I am...
MARTHA: No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
MOTHER MIRIAM: What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
MARTHA: There's another choice.
MOTHER MIRIAM: What?
MARTHA: Aquittal.
MARTHA: Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
MOTHER MIRIAM: All right, what do you need.
MARTHA: When would Agnes have conceived the child?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh, some time in January.
MARTHA: Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
MARTHA: Visitors to the convent.
MARTHA: Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
MARTHA: Take at look at it.
MOTHER MIRIAM: There's nothing here.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.): ... I should have suspected something.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
AGNES: In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
MOTHER MIRIAM: We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
AGNES: It made them holy.
MOTHER MIRIAM: It made them uncomfortable. And if
MOTHER MIRIAM: Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
MOTHER MIRIAM: How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
MOTHER MIRIAM: A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
AGNES: It's not that... it's not that...
AGNES: It's not my time of month.
AGNES: I don't know... I don't know...
MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.): That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.): The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.): Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
MARTHA: No.
MONSIGNOR: Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
MARTHA: Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
MONSIGNOR: Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
MARTHA: What does this have to do with..?
MONSIGNOR: And you had a sister who died in the convent.
MARTHA: Who told you this?
MONSIGNOR: Do you still go to church?
MARTHA: What business is it of yours..?
MONSIGNOR: Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
MARTHA: Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
MARTHA: I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
MONSIGNOR: Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.
MARTHA: Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
MARTHA: But you're troubled... aren't you?
MARTHA: And you're unhappy.
AGNES: Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't
MARTHA: What did you do?
MARTHA: What did you do?
MARTHA: Agnes, you're stupid.
MARTHA: Are you intelligent?
MARTHA: You're a mistake.
MARTHA: Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
AGNES: Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
MARTHA: I really love you.
AGNES: As much as Mother Miriam does?
MARTHA: As much as God loves you.
ELDERLY NUN: Look into the convent records.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
MARTHA: And Agnes' father?
MOTHER MIRIAM: It could have been any one of a dozen men from what my sister told me.
MARTHA: Like keeping her home from school?
MARTHA: Listening to angels?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She drank too much. That's what killed her.
MARTHA: Do you know what she did to her?
MARTHA: She molested her!
MARTHA: There is more here than meets the eye isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets.
MARTHA: Why didn't you? You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I knew that after the fact.
MARTHA: Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
LARRY: Marty, what are you doing here?
MARTHA: Larry there's got to be something missing.
LARRY: I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
LARRY: What? You think that the girl is innocent?
LARRY: You got to be crazy.
LARRY: What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
MARTHA: Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
SECRETARY (V.O.): Hi Marty, it's Helen. Mrs Davenport
MARTHA: I've gotten the court's permission to hypnotise her.
MOTHER MIRIAM: And my permission?
MOTHER MIRIAM: We'll see about that.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I haven't decided yet.
MARTHA: The woman's health is at stake.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Her spiritual health.
MARTHA: I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I know you don't.
MARTHA: Sentence her and be done with it, that's what you're saying and I...
MARTHA: An unhappy woman...
MOTHER MIRIAM: She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Because I am a moral person.
MARTHA: Bullshit!
MOTHER MIRIAM: Bullshit yourself!
MARTHA: Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
MARTHA: You just said...
MOTHER MIRIAM: What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
MARTHA: Nothing...
MOTHER MIRIAM: What have we done to hurt you? And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do? Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin? MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.) So instead of questioning that one rule...
MOTHER MIRIAM: No, it reminds me.
MARTHA: Would you like one? Huh?
MARTHA: Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
MARTHA: Saint Peter?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Pipe!
MARTHA: Right...
MOTHER MIRIAM: Mary Magdelen?
MARTHA: (imitating) Oh, you've come a long way baby.
MOTHER MIRIAM: And Saint John would chew tobacco.
MARTHA: Right. (a pause) What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
MOTHER MIRIAM: There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
MARTHA: Do you think they ever existed?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes I do.
MARTHA: Do you want to become one?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Become?     One is born a saint.
MARTHA: Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth. (she stands)
AGNES: I can't tell you that.
MARTHA: Will she be angry?
AGNES: She made me promise not to.
MARTHA: Who?     Who made you promise? (no answer) It's    alright Agnes. It's alright. (a pause) Let's    go to your room. It's the night about    six weeks ago when you were very    sick.
AGNES: I'm afraid.
MARTHA: Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
AGNES: I ate.
MARTHA: Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
AGNES: Fish... (distastefully) ... brussel sprouts.
MARTHA: You don't like brussel sprouts?
AGNES: I hate them.
MARTHA: And then what happened?
AGNES: We went to chapel for vespers.
MARTHA: Hm hmm.
AGNES: I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
MARTHA: What is it?
AGNES: Someone's following me.
MARTHA: Who?
AGNES: Sister Marguerite I think.
MARTHA: Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby? (no answer) Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night. MARTHA (Cont.) Open your eyes. (she opens them) What do you see?
AGNES: My bed.
MARTHA: What else?
AGNES: A crucifix.
MARTHA: Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it?
AGNES: (puzzled) A wastepaper basket.
MARTHA: Do you know who put it there?
AGNES: No.
MARTHA: What do you think it's there for?
AGNES: For me to get sick in.
MARTHA: Are you ill?
MARTHA: What do you feel?
AGNES: I feel as if I've eaten glass.
AGNES: I have to throw up... AGNES (Cont.) I can't... glass... one of the sisters has fed me glass.
AGNES: I don't know which one (distorted)
MARTHA: Why isn't anyone coming?
AGNES: Yes. Martha helps her to her feet. Agnes clings to her.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Is the Doctor in her office?
HELEN: Ah, who shall I say is calling?
HELEN: Just a minute please, you can't go in there.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
MARTHA: One that will ask the questions you want asked.
MOTHER MIRIAM: My God, but you're determined.
MARTHA: Who knew she was pregnant?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why do you insist upon pressing...
MARTHA: Was it you?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Is it because she's a nun?
MARTHA: Did you know she was pregnant?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes.
MARTHA: And you didn't send her to a doctor.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I didn't guess until it was too late.
MARTHA: For what?     An abortion?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh, don't be ridiculous.
MARTHA: Too late for what?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I don't know... too late to stop it.
MARTHA: The baby?
MOTHER MIRIAM: The scandal...
MARTHA: You went to the room to help with the birth.
MOTHER MIRIAM: She didn't want any help.
MARTHA: You wanted that child out of the way.
MARTHA: You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
MARTHA: You tied the cord around its neck.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
MARTHA: Before or after you killed the child?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I left it with her and I went for help.
MARTHA: I doubt that's what she'd say.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Then she's a liar.
MARTHA: Agnes, can you hear me?
MARTHA: I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
AGNES: She said Michael.
MARTHA: What did she mean?
MARTHA: And the passage to the barn?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Why?
AGNES: So I could go to him.
MARTHA: Who?
AGNES: Him.
MARTHA: How did she know about him?
AGNES: She'd seen him too.
MARTHA: Where?
AGNES: From the belltower the day she before she died.
MARTHA: So she sent you?
AGNES: Yes.
AGNES: Stay away from me...
MARTHA: Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
AGNES: Not your fault...
MARTHA: Agnes who did you see?
AGNES: I hate him for what he did to me.
AGNES: For what he made me go through.
MARTHA: Agnes, who did this to you?
MARTHA: Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
MARTHA: Agnes, what happened to the baby?
MARTHA: What happened to the baby?
MARTHA: It was alive wasn't it?
AGNES: I don't remember.
MARTHA: Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
MARTHA (V.O.): I don't know the meaning behind the song she sang. Perhaps it was a song of seduction. And the father was a fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply a lullaby that she remembered from many years ago. And the father was hope and... and love and desire. And a belief in miracles.
MARTHA (V.O.): I want to believe that she was blessed. And I do miss her, and I hope that she's left something, some little part of herself with me. That would be miracle enough wouldn't it?
