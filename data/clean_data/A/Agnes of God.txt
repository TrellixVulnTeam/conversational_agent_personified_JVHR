EVE: They want a woman.
LYON: All you have to do is meet with her once or twice. then tell the court she's insane.
MARTHA: Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
EVE: Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown. least of all me.
MARTHA: Eve, she strangled a baby!
EVE: Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
LEVEAU: We're not telling you what to decide Martha. We're not even telling you to take this.
LYON: Is there any reason why you feel you shouldn't take it?
MARTHA: Today's my birthday. I always make bad decisions on my birthday.
LEVEAU: Happy birthday.

MARTHA: Yes. I.
MOTHER MIRIAM: You can call me Sister.
MARTHA: . Thank you.
MOTHER MIRIAM: You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
MARTHA: You were a smoker?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Two packs a day.
MARTHA: I can beat that.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Martha inclines her head impressed. Mother Miriam sits down next to her.
MARTHA: Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
MOTHER MIRIAM: How did she hide it from the other nuns?
MARTHA: How did she hide it from the other nuns?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She undressed alone. she bathed alone.
MARTHA: Is that normal?
MOTHER MIRIAM: How did she hide it during the day?
MARTHA: How did she hide it during the day?
MOTHER MIRIAM: ( indicating her habit ) She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.

MARTHA: Could there have been anyone else?
MOTHER MIRIAM: ( a pause ) Obviously there was.
MARTHA: And you didn't try to find out who?
MOTHER MIRIAM: ( standing ) Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
MARTHA: Why haven't you asked her?
MOTHER MIRIAM: ( sitting again ) She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
MARTHA: Look, someone gave her the baby.
MARTHA: Why do you think that?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
MARTHA: Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally.
MARTHA: The science of psychiatry.
MOTHER MIRIAM: ( standing ) Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross ( also standing ) I am not with the Inquisition.

MARTHA: I just heard you.
AGNES: That wasn't me.
MARTHA: Was it Sister Marguerite? You're very pretty Agnes.

AGNES: They both halt.
MARTHA: They both halt.
AGNES: Where do you think babies come from?
MARTHA: From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I. I don't Well I think they come from. angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference. except bad babies cry a lot. and they make their fathers go away. and their mothers get very ill. die sometimes. Mummy wasn't very happy when she died . and, I think she went to hell because every time I see her she looks like she just stepped out of a hot shower, and I. I'm never sure if it's her, or the Lady who tells me things! They fight over me all the time. The Lady. I saw when I was ten. I was lying on the grass, looking at the sun, and the sun became a cloud, and the cloud became, a Lady. And she told me she would talk to me. And then. her feet began to bleed and I saw there. there were holes in her hands and in her side. And I tried to catch the blood as it fell from the sky, but I couldn't see any more because my eyes hurt because there were big black spots in front of them. And she tells me things like, like. right now she's crying Marie! Marie! . but I don't know what that means. . and. she uses me to sing, it's as if she's throwing a big hook through the air and it catches me under my ribs and tries to pull me up, and I. I can't move because Mommy's holding my feet and all I can do is sing in her voice. it's the Lady's voice, God loves you! God loves you.

MARTHA: Do you know a Marie?
AGNES: No. do you?
MARTHA: Why should I?
AGNES: I don't know.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Well. what do you think? Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre. or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
MARTHA: What's your opinion?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I believe Agnes is different.
MARTHA: From other nuns. Yes I. I've noticed.
MOTHER MIRIAM: From other people! I believe she is not crazy, nor is she How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
MARTHA: How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
MARTHA: ( lights a cigarette )
MOTHER MIRIAM: ( moves to her desk, In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
MARTHA: If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She didn't! This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
MARTHA: So, someone else could have done it.
MOTHER MIRIAM: No. not in the eyes of the police.
MARTHA: And in your eyes?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I've already told you what I thought.
MARTHA: That she was unconscious, yes! So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the.
MOTHER MIRIAM: You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
MARTHA: It's possible isn't it?
MOTHER MIRIAM: One of the other nuns found out about the baby and. and wanted to avoid a
MARTHA: One of the other nuns found out about the baby and. and wanted to avoid a
MOTHER MIRIAM: That's absurd!
MARTHA: That possibility never occurred to No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
MOTHER MIRIAM: No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
MARTHA: Is Father Martineau in please?
HOUSEKEEPER: ( in French )
MARTHA: ( answers in French )
HOUSEKEEPER: ( halting briefly ) Wipe your feet. Pere Martineau. ( in French )
HOUSEKEEPER: Pere Martineau.
FATHER MARTINEAU: ( French accent ) They arise at five in the morning. and they're in bed by nine at night. Even if a man could get to them, he would probably find them praying. That's why I see that the real question is not only how he got in, but when.
MARTHA: And you're the only man to see them?
FATHER MARTINEAU: I promise you Doctor, even if I had the inclination, how could I possibly catch her? She would have to be a very slow and patient nun. Ah no. they're a very special and rare people those Sisters. Only a few of them left in this modern world, consecrated to the praise of God.
MARTHA: Hello, Mama . brought you something.
MAMA: Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
MARTHA: It's your favourite.
MAMA: Who are you?
MARTHA: It's Martha, Mama. There you go.
MAMA: Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate. my favourite.
MARTHA: I thought cherry-vanilla was your Not any more. now I like chocolate.
MAMA: Not any more. now I like chocolate.
MARTHA: ( stroking her hair ) Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
MAMA: You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell. after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman. has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
MARTHA: ( lighting up ) Marie's dead Mama.
MAMA: I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad. and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in And you believed me.
MARTHA: Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
MAMA: ( a long pause ) Who are you?
MARTHA: I. I'm Martha, Mama.
SISTER ANNE: The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left. just us and the chickens.
MARTHA: How do you survive?
SISTER ANNE: Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves, some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
MARTHA: Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
SISTER ANNE: No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
MARTHA: Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
SISTER ANNE: Oh that one there, in the corner.
MARTHA: The one up on the third floor?
SISTER ANNE: Uh huh.
MARTHA: Uh huh.
MOTHER MIRIAM: This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
MARTHA: Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
MARTHA: When did you first learn about her. innocence, the way she thinks?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Shortly after she came to us.
MARTHA: And you weren't shocked?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I was appalled, just as you are now.
MARTHA: And what happened?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She stopped eating completely.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this?
AGNES: ( not looking up ) I've been commanded by God.
MOTHER MIRIAM: ( sighs ) He talked to you Himself?
AGNES: MOTHER MIRIAM
MOTHER MIRIAM: Through someone else?
AGNES: MOTHER MIRIAM
MOTHER MIRIAM: I can't say.
AGNES: I can't say.
MOTHER MIRIAM: She'd punish me.
AGNES: She'd punish me.
MOTHER MIRIAM: One of the other Sisters?
AGNES: MOTHER MIRIAM MOTHER MIRIAM ( Cont. )
MOTHER MIRIAM: Mother Miriam glances up at an older NUN who has been in the chapel watching all along. She takes the hint and hobbles out.

AGNES: suffering is beautiful, I want to be
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who tells you these things?
AGNES: Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
MOTHER MIRIAM: ( genuinely distressed ) That's not what he meant.
AGNES: I. I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I. I won't be able to fit in, I. I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where.
AGNES: No. I mean. I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh my dear child.
AGNES: ( standing ) God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but. but if I stay little it won't happen.
AGNES: Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but. but if I stay little it won't happen.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Your mother tells you this?. Agnes your mother is dead.
AGNES: But she watches. she listens.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
AGNES: I'm not hungry.
MOTHER MIRIAM: You've got to eat something Agnes.
AGNES: No I don't. the host is enough.
MOTHER MIRIAM: My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of Of God.
AGNES: Of God.
MOTHER MIRIAM: ( smiles ) Yes, of God.
AGNES: I'm being punished.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I don't know.
AGNES: I don't know.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Dear Jesus. She quickly leads Agnes out of the chapel.
AGNES: It started this morning and I can't get it to stop.
MARTHA: Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
MOTHER MIRIAM: It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again.
MARTHA: She had a. a hole in the palm of her hand! She could have bled to death.
MOTHER MIRIAM: But she didn't. did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property. newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
MARTHA: She has it now.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
MARTHA: Not simple, no.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
MARTHA: It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
MOTHER MIRIAM: God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
MARTHA: And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it? You bet I am.
MOTHER MIRIAM: You bet I am.
LARRY: Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
MARTHA: ( kissing him )

AGNES: ( very loudly ) I thought ugly thoughts about Sister
LEVEAU: Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
MARTHA: Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
LYON: Martha, your job is to diagnose, not to heal and play detective. Who do you think you are?
MARTHA: I know my job. Don't tell me my job Lyon. My duty as a doctor is to.
EVE: Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
MARTHA: No. no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
EVE: The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
MARTHA: The bishop is breathing down our necks.
EVE: The bishop is breathing down our necks.
MARTHA: And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
LEVEAU: ( in French )
MARTHA: I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
LYON: Well the bishop will be very upset about this.
MARTHA: I'm fighting for this woman's life, not some bloody bishop.
MARTHA: You liked Sister Paul?
AGNES: She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
MARTHA: ( crouching down ) What else did she tell you?
AGNES: She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that. She lived here for almost seventy years. Every day she'd ring the bell, wake us up, call us to God. She took me to my secret place.
MARTHA: Where's that?. I promise I won't tell, would you take me?
MARTHA: Sister Paul was in her eighties? Did she climb up here often?
AGNES: No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
MARTHA: ( halting, out of breath ) No wonder. wait. Agnes. Agnes how do you feel about babies?
AGNES: Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
MARTHA: Like what?
AGNES: ( climbing again ) Numbers. you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
MARTHA: ( following her ) I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
AGNES: I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
MARTHA: Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes . wait a minute. Agnes slow down.
AGNES: She said you could see the whole world from up here. But it looks much better far away than it looks close up.
MARTHA: Agnes lies down under the bell.
AGNES: And sometimes I get under here. it makes a wonderful sound.
MARTHA: What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
AGNES: Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
MARTHA: It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
AGNES: Where did you go?
MARTHA: Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes. have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
AGNES: No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
MARTHA: You have trouble sleeping?
AGNES: I get headaches. Mommy did too. oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
MARTHA: What things?
AGNES: She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
MARTHA: How did she know that?
AGNES: Somebody told her.
MARTHA: I don't know.
AGNES: I don't know.
MARTHA: You'll laugh.
AGNES: You'll laugh.
MARTHA: I promise I won't laugh. Who told An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
AGNES: An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
MARTHA: Did your mother see angels often?
AGNES: Do you?
MARTHA: Do you?
AGNES: Do you believe she really saw them?
MARTHA: Do you believe she really saw them?
AGNES: ( sitting up ) No, but I can never tell her that.
MARTHA: Why not? She'd get angry.
AGNES: She'd get angry.
MARTHA: besides I don't want to have a baby.
AGNES: besides I don't want to have a baby.
MARTHA: besides I don't want to have a baby.
AGNES: besides I don't want to have a baby.
MARTHA: besides I don't want to have a baby.
AGNES: besides I don't want to have a baby.
MARTHA: about getting one?
AGNES: about getting one?
MARTHA: about getting one?
AGNES: have a baby.
MARTHA: ( suddenly frustrated ) No, not like me!
AGNES: ( suddenly frustrated ) No, not like me!
MARTHA: they didn't want one?
AGNES: ( jumping to her feet ) A mistake.
MARTHA: Is that what she said?
AGNES: Is that what she said?
MARTHA: Is that what she said?
AGNES: ( very upset ) If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint. ( distorted )
MARTHA: Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex.
AGNES: I can't help it if I'm stupid.
MARTHA: . that you don't remember getting Not my fault.
AGNES: Not my fault.
MARTHA: . and that you don't believe you carried a child.
AGNES: I was a mistake.
MARTHA: What the child?
AGNES: Everything. I don't have children.
MARTHA: Martha puts her arm out to Agnes who slaps it away.
AGNES: Don't touch me like that! You don't touch me like that, I know what you want from me, you want to take God away. You should be ashamed, they should lock you up people like you.
MOTHER MIRIAM: You hate us don't you?
MARTHA: MOTHER MIRIAM
MOTHER MIRIAM: Nuns. you hate nuns.
MARTHA: I hate ignorance and stupidity.
MOTHER MIRIAM: The Catholic Church.
MARTHA: I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else.
MARTHA: How dare you tell me to run my affairs! It's my affair too.
MOTHER MIRIAM: It's my affair too.
MARTHA: How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I'm only interested.
MARTHA: . or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are? You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child. She is not a child.
MOTHER MIRIAM: She is not a child.
MARTHA: And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God.
MOTHER MIRIAM: ??? ( distorted )
MARTHA: ??? ( distorted ) . virginity, right Mother? Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.

It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud.
MARTHA: Then help her.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I am.
MARTHA: No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.

MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
AGNES: Yes Mother.
MOTHER MIRIAM: In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
AGNES: In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
MOTHER MIRIAM: We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
AGNES: It made them holy.
MOTHER MIRIAM: It made them uncomfortable. And if

MOTHER MIRIAM: Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
AGNES: I burnt them.
MOTHER MIRIAM: ( a long pause ) They were stained.
AGNES: ( a long pause ) They were stained.
MOTHER MIRIAM: How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
AGNES: Yes, Mother.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Say it! It is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Mean it!
MOTHER MIRIAM: A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
AGNES: It's not that. it's not that.
MOTHER MIRIAM: What do you mean?
AGNES: It's not my time of month.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Should you see a doctor?
AGNES: I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up. there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened. I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
MOTHER MIRIAM: For what?
AGNES: I don't know. I don't know.
SISTER: nuns singing hymns.
MARTHA: Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
MONSIGNOR: Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
MARTHA: Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
MONSIGNOR: Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved What does this have to do with..?

AGNES: I'm not sick.

MARTHA: And you're unhappy.
AGNES: Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't
MARTHA: Answer me! You never answer me.
AGNES: Answer me! You never answer me.
MARTHA: Sometimes, yes.
AGNES: Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
MARTHA: What did you do?
AGNES: I'm always bad.
MARTHA: What did you do?
AGNES: I breathed!
MARTHA: Agnes. What did your mother do to If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did. did she hit you? Did she make you do something you didn't want to? Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it? Did it embarrass you? Did it. did it hurt you? What did she make you you do?

MARTHA: As much as God loves you.
ELDERLY NUN: I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here. There was blood on her hand that night.
MARTHA: ( the nun shakes her head )
ELDERLY NUN: ( in French )
MARTHA: ELDERLY NUN
ELDERLY NUN: Look into the convent records.
MARTHA: But the nun has gone, walking quickly away down the corridor.
MARTHA: ( slightly guiltily ) Oh, Good afternoon Sister, I. I'm looking for some biographical data on Sister Agnes, and Mother said I might find it here. Thank you.
MARTHA: Thank you.
MARTHA: You lied to me
MOTHER MIRIAM: About what?
MARTHA: ( brandishing the files ) Your niece!
MOTHER MIRIAM: I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
MARTHA: No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
MARTHA: And Agnes' father?
MOTHER MIRIAM: It could have been any one of a dozen men from what my sister told me.
MARTHA: Like keeping her home from school?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Listening to angels?
MARTHA: Listening to angels?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She drank too much. That's what killed Do you know what she did to her?
MARTHA: Do you know what she did to her?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I don't think I care to know.
MARTHA: She molested her!
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh, dear God.
MARTHA: There is more here than meets the eye isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets.
MOTHER MIRIAM: ( crying ) Oh God, if only I'd known.
MARTHA: Why didn't you? You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I knew that after the fact.
MARTHA: Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Because I didn't know.
MARTHA: Oh, God.
MARTHA: Marty, what are you doing here?
LARRY: Marty, what are you doing here?
MARTHA: Larry there's got to be something I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
LARRY: I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
MARTHA: Something they. that they overlooked.
LARRY: What? You think that the girl is I don't know.
MARTHA: I don't know.
LARRY: You got to be crazy. What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
MARTHA: What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
LARRY: What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
MARTHA: Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
LARRY: You're too involved Marty. Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else? I'll ask around, see what I come up with. In the meantime you go home and get some sleep.
MARTHA: ( she leaves )
LARRY: ( calling after her ) If I find anything I'll call you.
MARTHA: I've gotten the court's permission to hypnotise her.
MOTHER MIRIAM: And my permission?
MARTHA: I'd like yours too.
MOTHER MIRIAM: We'll see about that.
MARTHA: Don't deny it!
MOTHER MIRIAM: I haven't decided yet.
MARTHA: The woman's health is at stake.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Her spiritual health.
MARTHA: I don't give a damn about her spiritual I know you don't.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I know you don't.
MARTHA: Sentence her and be done with it, that's what you're saying and I.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I am saying ( distorted ) a beautifully simple woman.
MARTHA: An unhappy woman.
MOTHER MIRIAM: She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
MARTHA: Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh? Why didn't you just throw the baby into the incinerator and be done with it.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Because I am a moral person.
MARTHA: MOTHER MIRIAM
MOTHER MIRIAM: Bullshit yourself!
MARTHA: Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who said anything about the Catholic You just said.
MARTHA: You just said.
MOTHER MIRIAM: What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
MARTHA: MOTHER MIRIAM MOTHER MIRIAM ( Cont. )
MOTHER MIRIAM: What have we done to hurt you? And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do? Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin? So instead of questioning that one rule.
MARTHA: ( halting ) It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run
MOTHER MIRIAM: Stupid woman. and that's all?
MARTHA: That's all? That's enough! She was a beautiful little girl.
MOTHER MIRIAM: And what has that to do with it?
MARTHA: I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me? I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
MOTHER MIRIAM: So you left the Church because you had No, because I. yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
MARTHA: No, because I. yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
MOTHER MIRIAM: When I was a child I used to hear my guardian angel. She sang to me 'till I was six years old. That's when I stopped listening. But I remember the voice. A few years ago I looked at myself and saw nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing. Not even of Heaven. Not even of God. And then one evening I saw Agnes standing by her window, singing. And all my doubts about
MARTHA: My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear. Does my smoking bother you?
MOTHER MIRIAM: No, it reminds me.
MARTHA: Would you like one? Huh?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I'd love one.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I'm out of prac. . practice.
MARTHA: All right?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Fine thanks.
MARTHA: Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More.
MARTHA: ( chuckles ) Long, thin and filtered.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare And of course ( distorted )
MARTHA: Hand rolled.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Even Christ would partake socially.
MARTHA: Saint Peter?
MOTHER MIRIAM: MOTHER MIRIAM
MARTHA: MOTHER MIRIAM
MOTHER MIRIAM: Mary Magdelen?
MARTHA: ( imitating ) Oh, you've come a long way baby.
MOTHER MIRIAM: And Saint John would chew tobacco.
MARTHA: ( a pause ) What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
MOTHER MIRIAM: There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people. those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
MARTHA: Do you think they ever existed?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes I do.
MARTHA: Do you want to become one?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Become? One is born a saint.
MARTHA: Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But. they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.
MARTHA: Do you think Agnes is still attached to Listen to her singing.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Listen to her singing.
MARTHA: ( a pause ) I'd like to begin.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Begin what?
MARTHA: The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Would it stop you if I did?
MARTHA: They both halt.
MOTHER MIRIAM: May I be present?
MARTHA: Of course.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Then let's begin.
MARTHA: You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a. warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
AGNES: Who am I?
MARTHA: Who am I?
AGNES: Doctor Livingston.
MARTHA: And why am I here?
AGNES: To help me.
MARTHA: Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
AGNES: Because I'm in trouble.
MARTHA: What kind of trouble? What kind of trouble Agnes?
AGNES: I'm frightened.
MARTHA: Of what?
AGNES: Of telling you.
MARTHA: But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
AGNES: ( a pause ) I had a baby. How did you have a baby?
MARTHA: How did you have a baby?
AGNES: It came out of me.
MARTHA: Did you know what was going to come
AGNES: yet. How did the baby get into you?

AGNES: I can't tell you that.
MARTHA: I can't tell you that.
AGNES: I can't tell you that.
MARTHA: Will she be angry?
AGNES: She made me promise not to.
MARTHA: Who? Who made you promise? It's alright Agnes. It's alright. Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
AGNES: I'm afraid.
MARTHA: Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
AGNES: I ate.
MARTHA: Hm hmm. What did you have for . brussel sprouts.
AGNES: ( distastefully ) . brussel sprouts.
MARTHA: You don't like brussel sprouts?
AGNES: I hate them.
MARTHA: And then what happened?
AGNES: We went to chapel for vespers.
MARTHA: Hm hmm.
AGNES: I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
MARTHA: What is it?
AGNES: Someone's following me.
MARTHA: Sister Marguerite I think.
AGNES: Sister Marguerite I think.

AGNES: A crucifix.
MARTHA: Above the bed? Any. anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it?
AGNES: ( puzzled ) A wastepaper basket.
MARTHA: Do you know who put it there?
AGNES: What do you think it's there for?
MARTHA: What do you think it's there for?
AGNES: For me to get sick in.
MARTHA: Are you ill?
AGNES: What do you feel?
MARTHA: What do you feel?
AGNES: I feel as if I've eaten glass.
MARTHA: What do you do?
AGNES: I have to throw up. I can't. glass. one of the sisters has fed me glass.
MARTHA: Which one?
AGNES: I don't know which one ( distorted )

MARTHA: Somebody told her.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who? That tun. that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
MARTHA: Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why would I lie?

MOTHER MIRIAM: Hasn't she had enough?
MARTHA: I have a few more questions to ask her.
MOTHER MIRIAM: My God, but you're determined.
MARTHA: Who knew she was pregnant?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why do you insist upon pressing.
MARTHA: Was it you?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Is it because she's a nun?
MARTHA: Did you know she was pregnant?
MOTHER MIRIAM: And you didn't send her to a doctor.
MARTHA: And you didn't send her to a doctor.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I didn't guess until it was too late.

MARTHA: Before or after you killed the child?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I left it with her and I went for help.
MARTHA: I doubt that's what she'd say.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Then she's a liar.
MARTHA: Agnes, can you hear me?
AGNES: I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
MARTHA: I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
