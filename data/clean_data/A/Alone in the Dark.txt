SHERIFF: What's going on, Adams?
DEPUTY ADAMS: Twenty kids live at this orphanage, Sheriff. All twenty have gone missing.
SISTER CLARA: After the power went out, I went to check on the children. But their beds were empty. Every one of them. They just
DEPUTY ADAMS: Are you okay, son? Are the other kids around here?
YOUNG EDWARD: I don't know. I don't remember.
DEPUTY ADAMS: Why don't we start with your name? Do you remember your name?
YOUNG EDWARD: Edward. Edward Carnby.
SMALL BOY: Did you have a nightmare?
CARNBY: Your mother is wrong. Being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive.
SMALL BOY: Everybody else tells me not to be afraid.
CARNBY: That's because they don't know the truth.
CABBIE: You travel light.
CARNBY: Trust me, I'm carrying enough baggage for the both of us.
CABBIE: That's pretty funny, man. What do you do?
CARNBY: You really want to know?
CABBIE: Yeah, man. Hearing about my passengers' lives keeps the job interesting.
CARNBY: I'm a paranormal investigator.
CABBIE: Get the fuck outta here!
CARNBY: I'm an effective solution to unusual
CABBIE: No shit? Want me to lose him?
CARNBY: If you can.
CABBIE: I'm trapped, man!
CARNBY: I'll draw him away.
BEAT COP: Pinkerton runs out of the Herbalist Store's back door. He runs directly at the high Wall.
GUARD: Got another delivery, Ms. Cedrac.
ALINE: I don't have anything scheduled. What museum was it transferred from?
DELIVERY GUY: For Dr. Hudgens, from Dr. Hudgens.
ALINE: It's probably an error. It must be for the big Abkani show.
DELIVERY GUY: Abkani? What the hell's Abkani?
GUARD: Ancient Native American civilization. They were this super-advanced culture, but something like ten thousand years ago, they just disappeared.
LINE: You've been reading up.
GUARD: Not much else to do around here at night.
DELIVERY GUY: Says here it's not to be opened by anyone but Dr. Hudgens.
GUARD: This is Aline Cedrac. She's the assistant We've got Abkani artifacts coming in from museums around the world. Until Hudgens gets back, I'm doing all the cataloguing Where is Hudgens anyway? The show opens in a few days.
ALINE: We've got Abkani artifacts coming in from museums around the world. Until Hudgens gets back, I'm doing all the cataloguing Where is Hudgens anyway? The show opens in a few days.
GUARD: Where is Hudgens anyway? The show opens in a few days.
ALINE: Off on another archeological goosechase. He thinks he's finally found the Erebus.
GUARD: So he sticks you with the work. At least it keeps your mind off your boyfriend.
LINE: I'll be in my office if you need me.
DELIVERY GUY: What was that all about?
GUARD: Damn it. I shouldn't have said that. Her boyfriend's been missing for the last three months.
DELIVERY GUY: Nice going, jack-ass.
CAPTAIN CHERNICK: They say a sunken ship is like a grave. It should never be disturbed.
HUDGENS: I've been searching for the Erebus for twenty years, Captain. Now that I've found it, I'm afraid your ill-informed superstitions aren't enough to stop me.
HUDGENS: Bring it up.
CAPTAIN CHERNICK: Don't you want to open it? Make sure it's what you're looking for?
HUDGENS: The conditions must be perfect. Otherwise, there will be. consequences.
CAPTAIN CHERNICK: Is this made of solid gold?
HUDGENS: Did you know the Abkani were the first civilization to use gold for their valuables? They believed it held the power to contain evil spirits. Thousands of years later, we don't even remember why gold was valuable to us in the first place. Now, let's load it onto the truck.
ALINE: The pictograms are late-period Abkani. It seems to be some sort of. prophecy. Shadows that make ghosts of men. The world of light consumed by darkness. This is the first indication I've ever seen that the Abkani had a myth about the end of the world.
CAPTAIN CHERNICK: If the container's made of gold, whatever's inside must be worth a You have no idea.
HUDGENS: You have no idea.
CAPTAIN CHERNICK: But I'm looking forward to finding out.
HUDGENS: I suppose one should not be surprised when mercenaries act mercenary.
CAPTAIN CHERNICK: The only mistake would be letting you walk out with whatever's in there.
HUDGENS: Captain! Don't open it!
C: APTAIN CHERNICK
APTAIN CHERNICK: Let's see what all the fuss is about.
LINDA: Linda rolls over and falls back asleep.
HUDGENS: They're faster than I thought.
CAPTAIN CHERNICK: Kill him.
BURKE: his better be good, Miles.
AGENT MILES: Sir, we're getting some strange readings in the control room.
BURKE: his is Bureau 713. "Strange" doesn't even crack my radar. Now what's the Well, sir, normal levels of paranormal activity range from three to five.
AGENT MILES: Well, sir, normal levels of paranormal activity range from three to five.
BURKE: condescending ) Yes Miles. And what level are the sensors picking up now?
AGENT MILES: We don't know.
BURKE: What are we looking at, Krashinsky?
KRASH: Electromagnetics off the scale,
AGENT YONEK: Recalibrating sensors now, sir.
SISTER CLARA: Still having trouble sleeping, Edward? You can't stay up all night, you know.
YOUNG EDWARD: Sister, something's happened.
SISTER CLARA: What is it, Edward?
YOUNG EDWARD: They're not gone anymore. The others are SCENE 51 AND 52 INCORPORATED INTO SCENE 50
CARNBY: ( groggy ) Edward, thank god!
CARNBY: Linda, what's wrong?
CARNBY: I'll figure this out, Linda. I'll find
LINDA: Edward. you've known each other since you were kids. Did he. did he tell you he was leaving me?
CARNBY: Of course not.
LINDA: Then where is he, Edward? What's going SCENES 56 AND 57 OMITTED
C: arnby drives up the gravel driveway in his black SUV. He pulls to a stop behind an old, battered yellow School Bus.
SISTER CLARA: Welcome home, Edward.
SOPHIE: Should I make some tea?
SISTER CLARA: Yes. Thank you, Sophie.
CARNBY: Sister. John disappeared last night. And something happened to me as well.
SISTER CLARA: It's happening again.
CARNBY: I need your help, Sister. I need to find the others.
SISTER CLARA: I'll get their files.
CARNBY: I'll let you know as soon as I hear
FISCHER: Why did I agree to this?
CARNBY: I ordered for you, Fischer. It's pecan.
FISCHER: You've got a good memory, Carnby.
CARNBY: That means all nineteen are missing.
FISCHER: I ran full cross-references. Nothing much in common between them. Except they all grew up in the same orphanage. Your orphanage. What's going on, Carnby?
CARNBY: That's what I'm trying to find out.
ALINE: HUDGENS ( ON THE PHONE )
ALINE: It's a fascinating piece, Dr. Hudgens. I started decoding the pictograms and.
ALINE: I was only going to catalogue it for you.
ALINE: But, Dr. Hudgens, I was just.
GUARD: There's. somebody here to see you.
ALINE: Aline runs up and embraces Carnby. She holds him tightly.
CARNBY: I missed you too.
ALINE: I thought you were dead, you asshole!
CARNBY: Aline. let me explain. In private.
ALINE: Give me one reason why I'd ever want to speak to you again?
CARNBY: Five minutes, Aline. I'll tell you
CARNBY: I was in the Amazon for six weeks, tracking poachers through their transport lines. Then I fell in with a group of ex- Chilean military selling artifacts on the black-market. This was found in a gold mine in the southern tip of Chile.
ALINE: And how did you end up with it?
CARNBY: I asked very nicely.
ALINE: You should've called, Edward. Or written. Just to let me know you were alive.
CARNBY: Does it make any sense to you?
ALINE: Yesterday, maybe not. But something happened last night.
ALINE: They were found in completely different locations. Alaska. Newfoundland. Venezuela. And now this one's from Chile.
CARNBY: Ten thousand years ago, it would've been like burying them at the ends of the
ALINE: The Abkani's written language is based on pictograms. Combinations of symbols to create different meanings. But there's one here I've never seen before.
CARNBY: You're not trying to seduce me, are you?
ALINE: Give me that.
G: UARD ( INTO PHONE )
ALINE: What is it?
CARNBY: Hairs on the back of my neck just stood
ALINE: How come every time you show up, my life gets complicated?
CARNBY: I could ask you the same thing.
CARNBY: I think we'd better run.
CARNBY: Can't hold it.
ALINE: No! Why didn't you ask me that before you pushed me in here?
ALINE: Those doors lead to the front entrance.
AGENT BARR: Reading two xenos.
AGENT CHEUNG: Agent Cheung opens FIRE. Agents Barr and Marko are immediately at her side, FIRING at the invisible creature. Their bullets glow as they streak through the air.
AGENT BARR: Cheung! Marko! Don't let them get away!
KRASH: Readings gone. You lost them, Barr.
BURKE: I want a full security sweep. Miles, get Fischer to send his sci-and-spy boys down here. Now go.
BURKE: hat the hell are you doing here, Carnby?
CARNBY: Hey Richie.
BURKE: It's Commander Burke. This is my unit.
ALINE: They saved our lives.
BURKE: You used to be able to take care of yourself, Carnby. Gotten soft since you left 713?
AGENT MILES: Ms. Cedrac, I'm Agent Miles. This is Commander Burke.
BURKE: Aline Cedrac. Pleasure to meet you. How's the Ph.D. coming along?
ALINE: It's fine. Thanks.
BURKE: Miles, get her to a medic.
CARNBY: I'll catch up.
BURKE: Why am I still looking at you?
CARNBY: I need to know what those things are.
BURKE: That information's classified. If you were still an agent, you'd already know. But since you're not, stay out of my way.
CARNBY: I'm asking nicely.
BURKE: Get him out of here!
CARNBY: You're right, Commander. I guess I have gone soft.
ALINE: I want to finish studying those I need to find out what's happened to John and the others. Stay in contact. We'll meet up later.
CARNBY: I need to find out what's happened to John and the others. Stay in contact. We'll meet up later.
ALINE: Commander, I need to get to my office.
BURKE: The museum's quarantined until we're At least let me pack up my work. There's priceless artifacts in there. If they get
ALINE: At least let me pack up my work. There's priceless artifacts in there. If they get
BURKE: If you notice anything out of the ordinary, let me know immediately.
ALINE: I don't think I want to know your definition of out of the ordinary.
FISCHER: You shouldn't be here, Carnby.
CARNBY: I'm not here. Commander Burke is. Now what the hell is that thing inside him?
FISCHER: Your curiosity have anything to do with the fingerprint of yours I found on his The list of people I trust is short, Fischer. Is it about to get shorter?
CARNBY: The list of people I trust is short, Fischer. Is it about to get shorter?
FISCHER: Yeah, we got dentals. Agent James Pinkerton. He's ex-713.
CARNBY: He was an agent? When?
FISCHER: Went MIA twenty years ago. Presumed dead. I'm trying to get more intell, but his records are so classified, they're practically invisible.
C: arnby takes the tongs from Fischer, holding open the skin. Fischer makes a series of incisions with the scalpel, disconnecting the spinal-worm from Pinkerton's spine.
CARNBY: It's fused with his nervous system.
FISCHER: I've never seen this kind of symbiosis
ALINE: Dr. Hudgens. When did you get back?
HUDGENS: A few hours ago. I heard there was some excitement. Are you alright?
ALINE: I'm fine. A bit shaken up. But fine.
HUDGENS: I apologize for snapping at you earlier. Now, what are you still doing here after all you've been through?
ALINE: This is a major find. I'll need to analyze it. Confirm its authenticity.
HUDGENS: This is a major find. I'll need to analyze it. Confirm its authenticity.
ALINE: I can do that myself.
HUDGENS: That wasn't a request.
HUDGENS: And you are?
AGENT CHEUNG: Ms. Cedrac's security detail.
HUDGENS: My dear, do you have any idea who I.
AGENT CHEUNG: ( interrupting ) Dr. Lionel Hudgens. Former agent, sci-and- spy division. Currently 713 advisor status. I know exactly who you are. But I'm not your "dear" anything.
HUDGENS: I'll just have to hold off my curiosity until morning.
ALINE: Dr. Hudgens. I forgot to ask. Did you find the Erebus this time?
HUDGENS: Just an empty shipwreck. You were right. It was another wild goosechase.
ALINE: Since when do I have a security detail?
AGENT CHEUNG: Since it seemed like you needed it.
FISCHER: There's one inside you too. But the symbiosis is incomplete.
CARNBY: Can you remove it?
FISCHER: I could try. But it might paralyze you.
ALINE: What's missing.
CARNBY: I'm not much for coincidences. These organisms must be connected to those things from the museum.
FISCHER: We call them xenomorphs.
CARNBY: Catchy. When did they first appear?
FISCHER: Two years ago. They've been 713's top priority ever since. But it's been almost exclusively in rural areas. This kind of urban infiltration is unprecedented.
CARNBY: Have you isolated any weaknesses?
FISCHER: Most metals pass right through them. So normal bullets and blades are useless. But they're vulnerable to elements 76 to 79. Osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold. Negates their ability to disrupt If they disrupt electricity, why did my flashlight still work?
CARNBY: If they disrupt electricity, why did my flashlight still work?
FISCHER: The closer the current to its power source, the less disruption.
CARNBY: I'm going to need a lot of those.
CARNBY: Five minutes.
LINE: Aline closes the door behind her. She takes another few steps into the Loft.
BURKE: Have you been meeting with Carnby?
FISCHER: Yes. He's got intell we need. And I trust
URKE: We've got to trust each other, Fischer. Are you with us or not?
F: What do you need from me?
ISCHER: What do you need from me?
BURKE: All the intell you've got on Edward
FISCHER: What else could I do? I had to tell him.
SARAH FISCHER: You did the right thing, Paul. From what you've told me, Carnby can take care of
FISCHER: Sarah? Answer me! Sarah!
HUDGENS: If you can't beat us, Fischer, join us.
ALINE: Something smells amazing.
CARNBY: I know.
ALINE: I figured out a connection with the symbols on those artifacts. They correspond to constellations. But something's missing.
CARNBY: Maybe this will help.
ALINE: Can you run the program on this?
CARNBY: What are we looking for?
ALINE: The Abkani used constellations to pin- point a geographical location. But I don't think I can isolate it closer than a hundred mile radius.
CARNBY: Yeah. That's us right there.
CARNBY: John lunges at Carnby. Carnby is too surprised to defend himself. John SLAMS Carnby against the wall, knocking his revolver out of his hands.
ALINE: That looked like John.
CARNBY: It is. The other two are from the orphanage as well.
C: arnby reacts instinctively. He FIRES, shooting John in the chest with a shotgun BLAST. John flails back, dead.
ALINE: You had no choice.
CARNBY: Something's controlling them.
ALINE: How many are there altogether?
CARNBY: Twenty. Including me.
A: ll that is visible of the creature's trajectory is furniture being knocked aside as the creature rushes towards them.
KRASH: Multiple readings confirmed. Back-up's on the way.
CARNBY: Carnby and Aline turn and OPEN FIRE on the creature. It flashes visible from multiple hits, flailing off into the Agent Barr FIRES controlled bursts of glowing bullets into the dark Loft. He screams into his comm-link.
AGENT BARR: We're clear, sir.
BURKE: Love what you've done with the place,
AGENT MILES: Sir, this one's infected too!
AGENT TURNER: Got another one here!
BURKE: Drop your weapon and get down on the What are you doing?
ALINE: What are you doing?
BURKE: He's been infected with some kind of organism. He could be under its control.
CARNBY: It's true. I've got one inside me. But it's not controlling me.
BURKE: You'll excuse me if I don't take your word for it. Now drop your weapon.
AGENT TURNER: Get out of the way!
ALINE: He's not one of them.
URKE: If I've got to shoot through you to get to him, I'll do it.
CARNBY: Why are the lights still out?
AGENT BARR: Scanner's clear.
BURKE: Forget to pay your power bill, Carnby?
ALINE: What does Hudgens have to do with this?
BURKE: That's what I want to find out. I need you both to brief me in the air.
KRASH: We're practically off the scale, Commander. This is unprecedented. Should I initiate Contingency Nine-Alpha?
KRASH: Is that a negative, Commander?
AGENT MILES: We've got three perimeters of flash- mines. Gatling guns are set to electromagnetic motion tracking. And every available agent in the vicinity is here. But Commander.
BURKE: I know, Miles. But back-up won't make it before sunrise.
AGENT TURNER: Generator will be on-line shortly, sir.
ALINE: It looks like you're going to war.
BURKE: We are. The highest xeno concentration on record is closing in on this location. This could be our chance to wipe them out once and for all.
CARNBY: We need to go down there.
BURKE: ( CONTINUED )
CARNBY: They're coming here for a reason. Until we know what they're after, we're never really going to be able to stop them.
AGENT MILES: Something's definitely down there, sir. But there's too much interference to get a clear reading from here.
BURKE: Goddamn it. Miles, you're in charge of perimeter defense. Nothing gets in or out until we find out what's down there.
ALINE: I've been thinking about something. The Abkani prophecy. The shadows that make ghosts of men.
CARNBY: Every culture has a story about the end of the world.
ALINE: But not every story starts to come true.
AGENT BARR: It's definitely this way, sir.
BURKE: It's a dead end.
AGENT BARR: Readings are getting stronger.
BURKE: We'll double-back. Take another tunnel.
CARNBY: Wait. Aline, look at this.
ALINE: They're Abkani.
AGENT CHEUNG: There's more over here.
AGENT BARR: What do you got, Marko?
BURKE: We've got to get down there.
AGENT FEENSTRA: How long do we have to hold them?
AGENT MILES: Only until dawn.
AGENT FEENSTRA: Sir. that's four hours away.
AGENT MILES: I know.
AGENT MILES: INT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL/GENERATOR PLATFORM 148 148 Agent Miles runs up to Agent Turner. He is still tinkering with the generator. The spotlights are still off.
AGENT MILES: Where the hell are the lights?
AGENT TURNER: The generator's not coming on-line. They must be disrupting it.
CARNBY: Aline throws her arms around Carnby's neck.
BURKE: Cheung! Cut the line!
T: he Sand Chamber is pitch black. The only light comes from their lamps and flashlights.
ALINE: It's a warning.
CARNBY: The gist of it is, even if you make it down here alive, you're already dead.
ALINE: The gist of it is, even if you make it down here alive, you're already dead.
AGENT MILES: Hold your fire until they're at the second perimeter.
CARNBY: With a loud SQUEAL, a SAND WORM bursts out of the sand in front of Aline. At the end of its elongated body, a pair of snapping jaws fold out, lined with razor-sharp teeth.
BURKE: We've got to get up there.
GENT TURNER: Hit it.
T: here's a moment of quiet. The Agents slump back, relieved. The creatures are all gone.
AGENT FEENSTRA: We made it, sir.
A: gent Turner turns to see Fischer approaching.
AGENT TURNER: In a quick motion, Fischer grabs Agent Turner by the throat and hurls him out of the way.
A: gent Miles OPENS FIRE, sending a stream of glowing bullets at the approaching creatures.
C: We'll find a way out.
CARNBY: We'll find a way out.
ALINE: Maybe this is what they look like when they grow outside a human host?
BURKE: I think you'd better see this.
AGENT MILES: The creature pounces. But Feenstra is fast enough. She BLOWS AWAY the creature with a BURST of glowing bullets.
A: line comes up to the concrete wall, running her hands along its flat surface. It is obviously not Abkani.
ALINE: The Abkani didn't put this here.
GENT BARR: There's no way through.
BURKE: There's always a way.
AGENT FEENSTRA: I'm out.
AGENT MILES: Last one.
AGENT FEENSTRA: I can't walk. If I lay down suppressing fire, maybe you can make it out of here.
AGENT MILES: I die fighting or I don't die at all.
ALINE: You sure this is going to work?
ALINE: What is this place?
CARNBY: This is where it happened.
ALINE: Who did this to you?
AGENT BARR: Carnby, Burke, and Aline approach Barr at the hangar doors.
A: line uses her flashlight to read the symbols on the door. One symbol is prominent among the others: the DARK SPIRIT.
ALINE: Edward, look.
CARNBY: So it's a key.
BURKE: I say we got two options. One, we open this door, deal with whatever's on the other side.
ALINE: The pictograms carved here make it pretty clear that's a bad idea.
BURKE: Two, we set enough C-4 to bury this place. Keep whatever's in there, down here for good.
CARNBY: The answers I've been looking for my whole life could be in there.
ALINE: Some doors are locked for a reason.
CARNBY: Barr. how much C-4 you got left?
AGENT BARR: Enough to blow this place to.
HUDGENS: I'm afraid I can't allow that.
CARNBY: It was 713.
HUDGENS: Our early work was crude, I admit. But eventually we perfected the implant process. You were our last failure, Carnby. If you hadn't escaped, 713 never would've shut down the experiments.
BURKE: There's no way this was sanctioned.
HUDGENS: Before your kind took over, 713 had very different. priorities. Now, you just blaze in and destroy everything before we can learn to control it. I've wasted twenty years working in secret because of short-sighted men like you.
CARNBY: Hudgens turns to Carnby, curious.
HUDGENS: You couldn't have opened it anyway. Not without this.
A: line inserts the device into the opening in the door.
T: he creature moves up to Hudgens' hand, smelling it.
LINE: These doors won't hold them for long
BURKE: Once we get out, we can remote detonate.
CARNBY: Look at the dust on the floor. This is where Hudgens got in.
CARNBY: Over there!
B: urke stands at the bottom of the Shaft, looking up at them. Carnby stops climbing and looks down at Burke.
BURKE: The remote detonator's inactive. The signal can't get through.
CARNBY: We'll find a way.
URKE: You saved my life, Carnby. I don't much like debts.
CARNBY: Carnby jumps down to the bottom of the Shaft, chasing after 176A INT. UNDERGROUND LAB/TUNNEL 176A Burke runs up to the sliding door to the Lab. He engages the opening mechanism. The door slides open.
ALINE: Edward. if he detonates those charges, we're all dead.
T: he whole mountain RUMBLES from the detonation.
CARNBY: They were under us the whole time.
ALINE: Where are all the children?
CARNBY: Something's very wrong.
ALINE: Edward. what's going on?
CARNBY: Remember what Hudgens said? I was his last failure. He said he perfected the implant process.
ALINE: It can't be.
CARNBY: Then where the hell is everybody? Where's everybody gone?
ALINE: Yes Edward?
CARNBY: It's going to be a busy day.
