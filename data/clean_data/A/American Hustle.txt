RICHIE DIMASO: Stoddard, let us do what we need to do to rule out corruption and to get rid of the payoff guys that are ruining this country. That's my dream. Don't smother it, please.
STODDARD THORSEN: You know Richard, I understand your eagerness. I really do. You know I'm from Michigan, right? Let me tell you a story about me, and my dad, and my brother. We used to go ice fishing every November. Ice Fishing. That's what we lived for.
RICHIE DIMASO: Holy shit
STODDARD THORSEN: Just listen to me. It's beautiful. You have a little stove. You huddle around, you keep each other warm. You drop a line and you just wait. One year my brother says, "let's go in October." He wants to go ice fishing in October. My dad says, "No, the ice is too thin." My brother says I love my brother he says
RICHIE DIMASO: I understand what's happening. You're saying your brother went out on the ice, the ice was too thin, he fell through the ice, he went in the water because he was too eager, and you're saying I'm too eager that's what you're saying?
STODDARD THORSEN: No, that's not what I'm saying.
RICHIE DIMASO: What are you saying?

And Stoddard had to say it was his own idea or he'd look stupid in front of his boss.
STODDARD THORSEN: Thank you, sir, wait, the sheik

CARMINE POLITO: Take it off! Take the bag off his

IRVING ROSENFELD: It's not fucking true. That's not I can save all of us, and we can save money. I can take care of you and Danny. OK? But you gotta close your mouth.
IRVING ROSENFELD: I can save all of us, and we can save money. I can take care of you and Danny. OK? But you gotta close your mouth.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD: I knew it. I have always said, Irving, that you are very, very hard to motivate properly. And I knew that Pete was gonna go over there and knock some sense into you. I've been reading this book, Irving. It's by Wayne Dyer, about the power of intention. And my intention in sending Pete over to you was so that you could come up with this plan. So, you're
IRVING ROSENFELD: OK. Thank you, Rosalyn. Thank you for the plan.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD: You're welcome.
IRVING ROSENFELD: I appreciate that. So, I think that we should be partners on this.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD: I'm a good partner. Almost better than Edith. You ever think about that? You ever think about how you might have underestimated me?
IRVING ROSENFELD: So what is our plan? Tell me the plan. What are you gonna do?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD: I'm going to keep my mouth shut and I'm not going to say anything but what do I do if Pete calls me? What am I supposed to say?
IRVING ROSENFELD: You gotta stop talking about your government agencies and your I.R.S. and your tax and your conspiracies and all of that. You're gonna say how you were wrong, you were wrong about that.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD: I'll tell Pete that I was wrong but you know that in real life, I was right for saying all that stuff because then that spurred on the actions that made you come up with this plan. So I will tell Pete.
IRVING ROSENFELD: ( holding his head )
ROSALYN ROSENFELD: ( pointing with cigarette The power of intention Irving. The power of intention.
IRVING ROSENFELD: OK. You were right.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD: Irving, I've been doing a lot of thinking and you need to grow up. And you need to face the facts. And I think that both of us will be a lot happier if we get a
IRVING ROSENFELD: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
ROSALYN ROSENFELD: Just think about it. ( kisses him ) These things are never easy.
IRVING ROSENFELD: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
ROSALYN ROSENFELD: Irving. Good luck with your plan.
ALFONSE SIMONE: Alfonse Simone.
EDITH GREENSLY: Edith Greensly.
IRVING ROSENFELD: Irving Rosenfeld.
RICHIE DIMASO: Good afternoon.
ALFONSE SIMONE: Please, be seated.
RICHIE DIMASO: Where is Mr. Tellegio?
ALFONSE SIMONE: Mr. Tellegio unfortunately was called out of town on business.
RICHIE DIMASO: That's not good. We were willing to come here today, in person, to see Mr. Tellegio, as a sign of respect to give two million dollars
ALFONSE SIMONE: I can assure you that I have the power of attorney
RICHIE DIMASO: Excuse me. If you'll let me finish, we are willing to give two million dollars today of the ten. But without Mr. Tellegio here
IRVING ROSENFELD: ( to Simone ) We can't, we can't make that decision. It's not the right thing. It's not the right time. It's just not good.
EDITH GREENSLY: ( to Irving across Richie ) You don't have the authorization to make this kind of choice so don't be hasty, alright?
IRVING ROSENFELD: I'm not being hasty. It's just, let's be smart about it. This is not how we do business. ( to Simone ) I'm sorry. I apologize. He's right, we can't.
RICHIE DIMASO: He's right, we can't.
EDITH GREENSLY: I think you should hang in there.
RICHIE DIMASO: For what? The guy's not here.
IRVING ROSENFELD: He isn't.
RICHIE DIMASO: That's it.
IRVING ROSENFELD: This is a surprise. The Sheik doesn't like surprises.
EDITH GREENSLY: Don't leave.
IRVING ROSENFELD: ( in doorway with Richie ) Edith, this is not your decision to I understand but maybe we can call the Sheik. Let's call the Sheik.
EDITH GREENSLY: I understand but maybe we can call the Sheik. Let's call the Sheik.
IRVING ROSENFELD: That's not the plan. That's not
RICHIE DIMASO: No, let's I'll call the Sheik. ( to Simone ) Can I use your phone?
ALFONSE SIMONE: Please do.
RICHIE DIMASO: ( to Alfonse Simone ) I don't know if he's in, I'll call the Sheik. But before I do, I'd like to go over specifically what this money will be used for.
ALFONSE SIMONE: What we will do is we guarantee all proper licenses and construction permits for any hotel casino that plans to open before the end of the
RICHIE DIMASO: What if there are obstacles, what will you do?
ALFONSE SIMONE: Obstacles? We are prepared to overcome any obstacles.
RICHIE DIMASO: This is a big enterprise.
ALFONSE SIMONE: If we have to pay somebody off, we'll pay somebody off. If we have to lean on somebody, intimidate somebody, we'll intimidate somebody. We're experienced. This is our business.
RICHIE DIMASO: That's powerful stuff. Thank you.
ALFONSE SIMONE: And I'll tell you something else. At the end of this we'll teach you how to skim and how to cut it up and make some money on the side. Because we invented skimming. We've been doing it for thirty years.
RICHIE DIMASO: Thank you. Thank you for clarifying
ANTHONY AMADO: This is the Sheik.
RICHIE DIMASO: ( on phone ) Mr. Tellegio is not here. It's just Mr. Alfonse Simone, his lawyer. Are we still ok to wire the Simone can take the money. What's the number?
ALFONSE SIMONE: Simone can take the money. What's the number?
RICHIE DIMASO: Amado writes it down and hands it to Brenda to call in.
5317AP: Amado writes it down and hands it to Brenda to call in.
BRENDA: The funds have been transferred.
ANTHONY AMADO: ( on phone to Richie ) The funds have been transferred.
RICHIE DIMASO: The money's been wired.
ALFONSE SIMONE: I think we have a deal.
RICHIE DIMASO: Yes we do sir.
ALFONSE SIMONE: Pleasure doing business with you.
RICHIE DIMASO: Okay, well, thank you very much, Mr. Simone.
ALFONSE SIMONE: I'm sure that we'll be seeing each
RICHIE DIMASO: ( grinning ) Oh I'm sure we'll be seeing each other very soon. You may even get sick of me, like these two.
ALFONSE SIMONE: I don't think I'll get sick of you. Nice meeting you.
RICHIE DIMASO: FINALLY! FINALLY WE GET SOME We're ambitious, that's why!
RESPECT!: AMADO SITS IN HIS CHAIR WITH CIGAR IN ONE HAND AND DRINK IN THE OTHER. VERY EXCITED AND LAUGHING AS HE POINTS AT RICHIE. Richie suddenly moves to the reel to reel surveillance tape and quiets the room, the music momentarily stops as we hear Alfonse Simone on the surveillance tape.
ANTHONY AMADO: ( shouts through clamor ) We're ambitious, that's why!
RICHIE DIMASO: Shh, shh, shh!
RICHIE DIMASO: ( in unison with Simone on If we have to lean on somebody, intimate somebody, we'll intimidate
IRVING ROSENFELD: I gotta do it.
CARMINE POLITO: What do you mean, there's no sheik? What does that mean, "there's no sheik"? What does that mean?
IRVING ROSENFELD: I want to face you like a man because I want to be real now.
CARMINE POLITO: Who is "they"?
IRVING ROSENFELD: It's the Feds.
CARMINE POLITO: The Feds?
IRVING ROSENFELD: CARMINE POLITO
CARMINE POLITO: Irving I'm a good person
IRVING ROSENFELD: You are!
CARMINE POLITO: I've been doing this for a long time, for twenty years. Do you think I woulda taken that money if it wasn't the right thing to do?
IRVING ROSENFELD: Hey look, you're a good person I know that but in all honesty
CARMINE POLITO: ( screams ) You said that was the only way, Irv. You chased me, remember?
IRVING ROSENFELD: They fuckin' made me do it. What was I supposed to do? They had Syd in jail.
CARMINE POLITO: You made me go back to the Plaza to take that money, you piece of shit! I was gone! You fucking prick!
DOLLY POLITO: Is everything alright? Can I have a word with you?
CARMINE POLITO: ( very upset ) No, please, Dolly, just go upstairs. Take the kids and go Alright, alright.
DOLLY POLITO: Alright, alright.
IRVING ROSENFELD: I want to make this right. I came here because I want to make it
CARMINE POLITO: Look at my face. You tell me that I'm lying to you when I say that everything I do is for the good of the people of New Jersey. Everything I do is for them. Am I lying to you?
IRVING ROSENFELD: I never had a friend like you I used that money for the goddamn I got some leverage, alright? I can help you out.
CARMINE POLITO: I used that money for the goddamn I got some leverage, alright? I can help you out.
IRVING ROSENFELD: I got some leverage, alright? I can help you out.
CARMINE POLITO: This is all shit. It's all
IRVING ROSENFELD: Carmine, Syd and I got a plan for you. We can help you out.
CARMINE POLITO: Please get out of my house, Irving. Will you please leave? I'm asking you nicely, please leave.
DOLLY POLITO: Get out of our house!
IRVING ROSENFELD: I don't want to ( seeing kids ) I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen.
CARMINE POLITO: ( to kids ) This is not our friend!
IRVING ROSENFELD: Truly, I didn't mean for this to Carmine points to his family.
CARMINE POLITO: This is what matters to me most and you're crushing it! You're going to take me away from them you fucking son of a bitch? Get the fuck out!
IRVING ROSENFELD: ( beaten, bloody on floor ) I just want to make it right.
CARMINE POLITO: Get out of my house. Look what you made me do!
IRVING ROSENFELD: ( stumbling out the door ) I'm sorry Carmine, I'm sorry.
SYDNEY PROSSER: RUNS TO HIM IN HER HIGH HEELS HELPS HIM SIT UP ON THE She digs through his pockets, finds the pills, and feeds one to him. Sydney struggles to help Irving to his feet and together, an embattled but surviving couple, they cross the street arm and arm. She opens the door and helps him into the car.
IRVING ROSENFELD: I've got to lay down.
SYDNEY PROSSER: Just rest.
SYDNEY PROSSER: ( emotional, quiet ) Are you ready?
IRVING ROSENFELD: They stare at each other.
ANTHONY AMADO: Please. Come in. Sit down.
IRVING ROSENFELD: Two million? ( Irving pushes his new glasses up the bridge of his nose ) It's with Victor Tellegio and Alfonse Simone.
ANTHONY AMADO: No, actually it's not with Victor Tellegio or Alfonse Simone.
RICHIE DIMASO: He fucking knows about it.
ANTHONY AMADO: It's gone missing. Did you know Where's it gone?
IRVING ROSENFELD: Where's it gone?
ANTHONY AMADO: That's interesting that you said that because while you were on your way over here, we got an anonymous phone call from someone who said that in exchange for immunity for the two of you and a reduced sentence for Carmine Polito we get our two million dollars back.
IRVING ROSENFELD: That's interesting. That's very interesting. I have no idea.
ANTHONY AMADO: No idea?
IRVING ROSENFELD: No idea what you're talking about.
ANTHONY AMADO: I got it. I understand how these deals are made. See, someone has Anthony, fuck them. It's over. We got them for wire fraud, it's over. ( to Irving and Sydney ) You're done. You're both done.
RICHIE DIMASO: Anthony, fuck them. It's over. We got them for wire fraud, it's over. ( to Irving and Sydney ) You're done. You're both done.
IRVING ROSENFELD: I don't think so.
RICHIE DIMASO: Oh, you don't think so?
IRVING ROSENFELD: Richard, think about it, YOU requested the two million. And you gave Brenda the account number. We didn't do any of that. None of it. ( turns dramatically to face Richie ) How do we know that YOU don't have the money?
RICHIE DIMASO: ( Richie looks from Irving Am I living in a fucking nightmare right now?
IRVING ROSENFELD: I find this a little offensive. Really, I find this a little offensive and I don't see that you got any sort of solid case against
RICHIE DIMASO: ( to Amado and Stoddard ) Don't let him get in your heads. Listen to me, we're dealing with a very clever individual.
IRVING ROSENFELD: Richard, think about it. You got some big arrests. You got U.S. Congressmen. You look good. You're gonna be all over the news. You know what doesn't look good? A story about gross incompetence
RICHIE DIMASO: I have a warrant for I'm sorry, do I have the wrong office?( checks number on the door ) Is this 701? Alfonse Simone?
SYDNEY PROSSER: You lost two million dollars of taxpayer money because you were confused about the location and the identity of Victor Tellegio's
ED MALONE: Alfonse Simone.
EDITH GREENSLY: People believe what they want to believe Richie.
RICHIE DIMASO: That's because you conned me! You both fucking conned me. You both got under me. You did!
IRVING ROSENFELD: Well that doesn't sound so good, either. I mean and I don't know what you're talking about, but let's just assume you want to go with that story. Really? That's the story you want to go with? That's what you want the New York Times to hear? That you got conned by the very con men who you forced to entrap the members of Congress in the first place. That's what you want to go with? That doesn't sound so good for your whole thing.
RICHIE DIMASO: That's what I was trying to go I'm sorry to tell you, you got none of 'em.
IRVING ROSENFELD: I'm sorry to tell you, you got none of 'em.
STODDARD THORSEN: You know, Richard, I think we may call you as a witness, but otherwise you're done. I think you better go home.
RICHIE DIMASO: STODDARD THORSEN
STODDARD THORSEN: Go on home, Richard.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD: The car is a little dinged up and I'm a little stiff but I don't want to talk about it.
PETE MUSANE: ( to Irving ) You know my boss knows you did him a solid.
IRVING ROSENFELD: Yes I did. He never took a nickle so they can't get him for nothing. I was never going to let that
ROSALYN ROSENFELD: He stops and looks at her. With red lacquered nails Rosalyn places her favorite nail finish in his hand.
