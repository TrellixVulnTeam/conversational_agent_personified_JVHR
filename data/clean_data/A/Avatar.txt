JAKE: I hope you realize you've just lost a
JAKE: ( to himself ) Candy ass bitch.
JAKE: If it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'!
AGENT 1: Are you Jake Sully?
JAKE: Step off. You're ruinin' my good mood.
AGENT 2: It's about your brother.
JAKE: Jesus, Tommy.
AGENT 1: Your brother represented a significant investment. We'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract.
JAKE: ( a hoarse whisper ) Are we there?
MED TECH: We're there, Sunshine.
MED TECH: People, you have been in cryo for five years, nine months and twenty two days. You will be hungry, you will be weak. If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your convenience. The staff thanks you in advance.
CREW CHIEF: Exopacks on!
CREW CHIEF: Remember people, you lose your mask you're unconscious in 20 seconds and you're dead in four minutes. Let's nobody be dead today, it looks bad on my report.
CREW CHIEF: Exopack on, let's go!
CREW CHIEF: Go directly into the base! Do not stop! Go straight inside!
WAINFLEET: Look at all that new meat.
FIKE: Check it out, man. Meals on wheels.
WAINFLEET: That is just wrong.
JAKE: What're you two limpdicks starin' at?
WAINFLEET: Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up in one.
QUARITCH: . You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen. Respect that fact every second of every day.
QUARITCH: Out beyond that fence every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for
QUARITCH: We have an indigenous population of humanoids here called the Na'vi. They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin which can stop your heart in one minute. We operate we live at a constant threat condition yellow.
QUARITCH: As head of security, it's my job to keep you alive. I will not succeed not with all of you. If you wish to survive, you need a strong mental attitude, you need to follow procedure.
NORM: Hey, you're Jake right? Tom's brother? You look just like him. Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman, I went through avatar training with him.
NORM: He was a great guy funny. It was a big shock to all of us.
JAKE: Jake pumps the wheels of his chair, rolling on. Norm walks with him.
NORM: And duh! obviously you look like him. I mean, if you weren't genetically identical, you wouldn't be taking over his avatar.
JAKE: That's why I'm here.
NORM: So you want to go check it out?
MAX: Me and Norm were out here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatars. They're grown from human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives here.
JAKE: Damn. They got big.
NORM: Yeah, they mature on the trip out. So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty Yeah, they've got great muscle tone. Give us a few hours, you guys can take them for a spin.
MAX: Yeah, they've got great muscle tone. Give us a few hours, you guys can take them for a spin.
JAKE: It looks like him.
NORM: No, it looks like you. This is your avatar now, Jake.
JAKE: so their nervous systems are in tune. Or something. Which is why they offered me this gig, because I can link with Tommy's avatar, which was insanely Is this right? I just say whatever in these videologs?
NORM: Yeah. You just need to get in the habit of documenting everything what you see, what you feel it's all part of the science. Good science starts with good observation.
JAKE: ( to camera ) So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science. ( looks around ) Never been in a lab before.
MAX: Log off. It's time to meet your boss for the next five years.
NORM: Grace Augustine is a legend. She's the head of the Avatar Program, and she wrote the book I mean literally wrote the book on Pandoran botany.
MAX: ( low, over his shoulder ) That's because she likes plants better than people.
GRACE: ( YELLING ) Who's got my goddamn cigarette?!
MAX: And here she is, Cinderella back from the ball. Grace, I'd like you to meet Norm Spellman and Ja
GRACE: Norm. I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi?
NORM: ( Na'vi, subtitled ) May the All Mother smile upon our first
GRACE: ( SUBTITLED ) Not bad. You sound a little formal.
NORM: ( SUBTITLED ) There is still much to learn.
MAX: Uh, Grace, this is Jake S
GRACE: ( turning to Jake ) Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I don't need you. I need your brother. ( to Max ) You know the PhD who trained three years for this mission.
JAKE: He's dead. I know it's a big inconvenience to everyone.
GRACE: How much lab training have you had? Ever run a gas chromatograph?
JAKE: Any actual lab work at all?
GRACE: Any actual lab work at all?
JAKE: High school chemistry. But I ditched.
GRACE: You see? You see? They're pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it I'm going to Selfridge.
MAX: Grace, that's not a good idea.
MAX: Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred. Try to use big words.
GRACE: Parker, I used to think it was benign neglect, but now I see you're intentionally screwing us.
SELFRIDGE: Grace. You know I enjoy our little I need a research assistant, not some jarhead dropout.
GRACE: I need a research assistant, not some jarhead dropout.
SELFRIDGE: Actually, we got lucky with him.
GRACE: Lucky? How is this in any way lucky?
SELFRIDGE: Well lucky your guy had a twin brother, and lucky the brother wasn't an oral hygienist or something. A Marine we can use. I'm assigning him to your team as security escort.
GRACE: The last thing I need is another trigger happy asshole out there!
SELFRIDGE: Look, you're supposed to be winning the hearts and minds of the natives. Isn't that the whole point of your little puppet show? If you look like them, if you talk like them, they'll trust you?
SELFRIDGE: But after how many years? relations with the indigenous are only getting That tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.
GRACE: That tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.
SELFRIDGE: This is why we're here. Unobtanium. Because this little gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo. No other reason. This is what pays for the party. And it's what pays for your science.
SELFRIDGE: Those savages are threatening our whole operation. We're on the brink of war and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution. So use what you've got and get me some results.
GRACE: How much link time have you logged?
NORM: Five hundred and twenty hours.
JAKE: Like an hour.
GRACE: Tell me you're joking.
JAKE: Don't! I got this.
GRACE: So you just figured you'd come out here to the most hostile environment known to man, with no training of any kind, and see how it went? What was going through your head?
JAKE: Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling me what I couldn't do.
GRACE: Relax and let your mind go blank. That shouldn't be hard for you.
JAKE: Kiss the darkest part of my lily white
MAX: Initiate link.
MAX: That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.
GRACE: Go figure. Alright, I'm going in.
TECH: Phase-lock at forty percent. He's in That's it. Find your way home.
MAX: That's it. Find your way home.
MAX: He's in.
TECH: Phase-lock ninety nine percent. The link is stable.
MAX: Take it slow, Jake. We need to check your motor control. Try touching your fingertips together
MED TECH: Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down
MAX: Jake! Wait, we have to run some tests
JAKE: Well who'd you expect, numbnuts? Think
GRACE: Well who'd you expect, numbnuts? Think
GRACE: Motor control is looking good.
NORM: I am a living god.
QUARITCH: For you pogues, this is a banshee. A small one. See, they like it when I bring fresh meat out here. And this clearcutting really stirs up the hornet's nest. So keep your head on a swivel. If it moves, shoot it. If you're not sure it's moving shoot it! If it looks like a bunch of flowers you want to take home to Sally Rottencrotch SHOOT IT! What're you gonna do?
TROOPERS: Shoot it, sir!
QUARITCH: Outstanding. Let's roll.
JAKE: That's kinda freaky.
GRACE: Lights out amigos. See ya' at dinner.
GRACE: ( looking down ) Damn. Same old sack a' bones.
CUT TO: INT. COMMISSARY - EARLY MORNING JAKE sits with GRACE, NORM and the other avatar "drivers", while around them miners, troopers and other base personnel wolf their breakfasts. Grace is engaged in a heated conversation with another SCIENTIST.
TRUDY: Sully Colonel wants to see you in the Armor Bay.
JAKE: You guys're packing some heavy ordinance.
TRUDY: Yeah, `cause we're not the only thing flyin' around out there. Or the biggest. I'm gonna need you on a door gun, I'm a man short.
JAKE: Yeah, no problem.
TRUDY: See ya on the flight-line, zero nine. He's down there.
QUARITCH: This low gravity makes you soft. You get soft, Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning.
QUARITCH: I pulled your record, Corporal. Venezuela that was some mean bush. Nothing like this here, though. You got heart kid, coming out here.
JAKE: I figured just another hellhole.
MECHANIC: That servo's in, Colonel, if you want to try it.
QUARITCH: I was in First Recon a few years ahead of you. More than a few. Two tours in Nigeria, not a scratch. I come out here
QUARITCH: They could fix this if I rotated back. But you know what? I kinda like it. Reminds me every day what's out there. Besides, I can't leave
QUARITCH: This is my war, here.
QUARITCH: The avatar program is a joke buncha limpdick scientists. But we have a unique opportunity here, you and I. A recon Marine in an avatar body could get me the intel I need, on the ground, right in the hostiles' camp.
QUARITCH: Looks good. I need you to learn about these savages, gain their trust. Find out how I can force their cooperation, or hit `em hard if they don't. Maybe you can keep some of my boys from going home like you. Or That sounds real good, Colonel. So am I still with Augustine?
JAKE: ( NODDING ) That sounds real good, Colonel. So am I still with Augustine?
QUARITCH: On paper. You walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one, but you report to me. Can you do that for
QUARITCH: Look, son I take care of my own. Get me what I need, I'll see you get your legs back when you rotate home. Your real
GRACE: Start calibrating. We're on the flight line in ten minutes.
GRACE: What did Atilla want?
JAKE: Just Marines comparin' tattoos.
GRACE: ( not buying it ) Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine
GRACE: you're driving an avatar, now. That means you're in my world, got it?
JAKE: Got it.
GRACE: That son of a bitch has screwed up this program enough. All this exists so we can go out there and build a bridge of trust to these people, who could teach us so much. But thanks to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't even talk to us anymore.
JAKE: Then how's this supposed to work?
GRACE: We have a new face. You're fluent, you've studied the culture. You're non-threatening. The ones we know best the Omaticaya clan may give you a chance. Maybe you can get them back to the table before things go tits-up for good.
NORM: This is failing as a pep talk.
JAKE: How do we contact them?
GRACE: We don't. They contact us. If they see us taking our samples, treating the forest with respect Not trampling everything in sight they may reach out to us.
JAKE: Or they may skin us and make a drum.
GRACE: Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.
GRACE: Looks like a bull, six cows and some The bull has the red on the dorsal armor?
NORM: The bull has the red on the dorsal armor?
WAINFLEET: Yo Chacon! Get some!
GRACE: Stay with the ship. One idiot with a gun's enough.
WAINFLEET: Whatever you say, Doc.
WAINFLEET: ( LAUGHING ) Ya'll have fun out there.
GRACE: Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.
NORM: How will they know we're here?
GRACE: I'm sure they're watching us right now.
GRACE: Bring the soil probe right there, yellow case.
GRACE: ( WISTFULLY ) The stingbats knock them off. I guess I always hope somebody will come back and read them.
NORM: Why don't they come back?
GRACE: ( GRIMLY ) The Na'vi learned as much about us as they needed to know.
JAKE: ( turning to her ) What happened here?
GRACE: ( SHARPLY ) Are you going to help with this gear? We've got a lot to do.
GRACE: See, right here where the roots of the two trees interact.
SHTOONK!: A chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into the ground, REVEALING
GRACE: Don't shoot. You'll piss it off.
JAKE: It's already pissed off!
GRACE: Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.
GRACE: It's a territorial threat display. Do not run, or he'll charge.
JAKE: What do I do?
GRACE: Hold your ground!
JAKE: Oh yeah! Who's bad?! That's right.
JAKE: That's what I'm talkin' about, bitch!
JAKE: That's right motherf
JAKE: What about this one? Run, don't run? Run. Definitely RUN!
GRACE: Run. Definitely RUN!
GRACE: Sorry, Doc. He's just gonna have to hang on `till morning.
TRUDY: Sorry, Doc. He's just gonna have to hang on `till morning.
GRACE: He's not going to make it till morning.
JAKE: ( SCREAMING ) I don't have all goddamn night! Come on! Come on!
NEYTIRI: Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!
NEYTIRI: Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it and looks up at
JAKE: Wait, don't
NEYTIRI: ( in Na'vi ) Forgive me, my brother.
JAKE: Look, um, I know you probably don't understand this. But thanks. Thank you. I owe you.
NEYTIRI: ( in Na'vi ) Forgive me. May your spirit run with the Great Mother.
JAKE: I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along
JAKE: Hey, wait. Wait! Where you goin'?
JAKE: Slow down a second will you. I just want to thank you for killing those
NEYTIRI: Don't thank! You don't thank for this! This is sad. Very sad, only.
JAKE: Okay, I'm sorry. Whatever I did I'm
NEYTIRI: All this is your fault! They did not need to die.
JAKE: They attacked me. How'm I the bad guy
HERE: She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.
NEYTIRI: Your fault! You are like a baby, making noise, don't know what to do. You should not come here, all of you! You only come and make problems. Only.
JAKE: Okay, fine, you love your little forest friends. So why not just let them kill my ass? What's the thinking?
NEYTIRI: Why save you?
JAKE: Yes, why save me?
NEYTIRI: You have a strong heart. No fear.
NEYTIRI: But stupid! Ignorant like a child!
JAKE: If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should teach me.
NEYTIRI: Sky people can not learn. You do not
JAKE: He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace.
JAKE: Then teach me to "see."
NEYTIRI: No one can teach you to See.
JAKE: Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just got off on the wrong foot and
JAKE: you just have to get to know me. I'm Jake. Jake Sull
JAKE: Whooaaa shit!
JAKE: I need your help.
NEYTIRI: You should not be here.
JAKE: So take me with you.
NEYTIRI: No. You go back.
JAKE: ( off her amazed look )
JAKE: What are they?
NEYTIRI: Atokirina'. Seeds of the Great Tree very pure spirits.
JAKE: What was that all about?
NEYTIRI: CUT TO:
JAKE: What's your name?
NEYTIRI: ( SUBTITLED ) Tsu'tey, what are you doing?! He is my
TSU'TEY: ( SUBTITLED ) These demons are forbidden here. I will kill this one as a lesson to the others!
NEYTIRI: ( SUBTITLED ) Stop! There has been a sign. This is a matter for the Tsahik.
TSU'TEY: ( SUBTITLED ) Bring him.
EYTUKAN: ( SUBTITLED ) Why do you bring this creature here?
NEYTIRI: ( SUBTITLED ) I was going to kill him, but there was a sign from Eywa.
EYTUKAN: ( SUBTITLED ) I have said no dreamwalker will come here, to offend our home! His alien smell fills my nose
NEYTIRI: ( SUBTITLED ) Father, many atokirina came to this What's going on?
JAKE: What's going on?
NEYTIRI: My father is deciding whether to kill Your father!? Uh, good to meet you, sir.
JAKE: Your father!? Uh, good to meet you, sir.
MO'AT: ( NA'VI ) Step back!
MO'AT: ( SUBTITLED ) I will look at this alien.
NEYTIRI: That is Mother. She is Tsahik the one who interprets the will of Eywa.
JAKE: Who's Eywa?
MO'AT: ( thick accent ) What are you called?
JAKE: Jake Sully.
MO'AT: Why did you come to us?
JAKE: I came to learn.
MO'AT: We have tried to teach other Sky People. It is hard to fill a cup which is already My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask Doctor Augustine. I'm no scientist.
JAKE: My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask Doctor Augustine. I'm no scientist.
MO'AT: What are you?
JAKE: I don't know. I was a Marine uh, a warrior. Of the Jarhead clan.
TSU'TEY: ( SUBTITLED ) A warrior! I could kill him easily!
EYTUKAN: ( SUBTITLED ) No! This is the first warrior dreamwalker we have seen. We need to learn more about him.
JAKE: What's going on? What are they saying?
MO'AT: ( to Neytiri, subtitled ) Daughter. You will teach him our way, to speak and walk as we do.
NEYTIRI: ( SUBTITLED ) Why me? That's not fair! I only
MO'AT: ( SUBTITLED ) It is decided!
MO'AT: ( to Jake ) My daughter will teach you our ways. Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if your insanity can be cured.
MO'AT: ( SUBTITLED ) He is your responsibility.
JAKE: So it's all good, right? You and me
NEYTIRI: Do not speak.
JAKE: Don't get up.
JAKE: You never told me your name.
NEYTIRI: Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.
JAKE: Okay, again, a whole lot slower.
NEYTIRI: ( exaggerated slowness ) Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree.
JAKE: Nay-TEE-ree. That's nice. Nay-TEE-ree.
TSU'TEY: ( SUBTITLED ) These aliens try to look like people, but they can't.
MO'AT: ( SUBTITLED ) He seems dim to me. And his eyes are too
JAKE: Your mom likes me. I can tell.
MO'AT: ( SUBTITLED ) Neytiri will test this "warrior." Hey may learn nothing but we will learn much.
EYTUKAN: You speak truth. We must understand these Sky People if we are to drive them
JAKE: These rock. What are they?
NEYTIRI: Teylu. You call beetle larvae.
JAKE: That's some damn fine teylu. That's like grandma's teylu.
TSU'TEY: ( SUBTITLED ) I say she will kill him.
GRACE: Come on back, kid, that's it.
JAKE: Wha ? Oh.
GRACE: Damn, you were dug in like a tick. Is the avatar safe?
JAKE: ( huge grin ) Yeah, Doc and you are not going to believe where I am.
GRACE: so the kid's out there one night and he's got the Queen Bitch herself offering him the spare room and the car keys. It's not something you can teach.
JAKE: It's not something you can teach.
MAX: That's awesome, Jake.
GRACE: ( to Jake, getting serious ) For reasons I cannot fathom, the Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us Jarhead clan? ( he laughs ) And that worked?
QUARITCH: Jarhead clan? And that worked?
JAKE: ( GRINNING ) Yeah. They want to study me. See if I can learn to be one of them.
QUARITCH: That's how you seize the initiative. I wish I had ten more like you.
SELFRIDGE: Look, Sully find out what these blue monkeys want.
SELFRIDGE: Their damn village is sitting right over the richest unobtanium deposit for a hundred klicks in any direction. Which sucks for them because they need to Does Augustine know about this?
JAKE: ( taking that in ) Does Augustine know about this?
SELFRIDGE: Yeah, she does, and she's on the next ship back if she tries to cock-block me on it.
JAKE: So who talks them into moving?
QUARITCH: ( TURNING ) What if they won't go?
JAKE: What if they won't go?
QUARITCH: ( ICY ) I'm betting they will.
SELFRIDGE: Killing the indigenous looks bad, but there's one thing shareholders hate more than bad press and that's a bad quarterly statement. Find me a carrot to get them to move, or it's going to have to be all stick.
QUARITCH: You got three months. That's when the dozers get there.
JAKE: I'm on it.
JAKE: ( next photo ) ( next photo ) He's the clan leader ( indicating Mo'at ) but she's the spiritual leader. Like a shaman.
GRACE: He's the clan leader but she's the spiritual leader. Like a shaman.
JAKE: Got it. So who's this Eywa?
NORM: Who's Eywa? Oh, only their deity. The Great Mother. The goddess made up of all living things. You'd know that if you had any training whatsoever.
JAKE: Who's got a date with the chief's Knock it off. Jesus, it's like kindergarten around here.
GRACE: Knock it off. Jesus, it's like kindergarten around here.
GRACE: Neytiri was my best student. She and her sister Silwanin. Just amazing girls.
JAKE: I didn't meet the sister.
GRACE: ( QUIETLY ) No, she's dead. ( turning to him ) Okay, let's go village life starts Link is ready.
MAX: Link is ready.
GRACE: Don't do anything unusually stupid.
NEYTIRI: This is shahaylu the bond. Feel her heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong
NEYTIRI: You may tell her what to do inside. For now, say where to go.
JAKE: The horse LAUNCHES into a GALLOP. Jake flops around, with no idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly THROWN OFF. He lands painfully in the mud.
NEYTIRI: SERIES OF JUMP CUTS Jake falls off the horse in various ways, seemingly landing harder each time.
TSU'TEY: You should go away.
JAKE: ( to Neytiri ) I knew this guy could speak English.
TSU'TEY: ( SUBTITLED ) This alien will learn nothing. A rock Sees more.
NEYTIRI: CUT TO:
JAKE: You've got outer columns, then a secondary ring here, and an inner ring. Then a core structure, it's like a spiral, that's how they move up and down.
QUARITCH: I'm going to need accurate scans of all these columns.
JAKE: Roger that.
GRACE: I'm not about to let Quaritch and Selfridge micro-manage this thing. We're going up into the mountains.
NORM: The Hallelujah Mountains?
GRACE: That's right.
NORM: ( off Jake's look ) The legendary Floating Mountains of Pandora? Heard of them?
TRUDY: It only takes tiny inputs. Here, put your hand on the cyclic
TRUDY: Feel how small the moves are? You barely have to think it, and the aircraft
GRACE: See these magnetic formations. We're getting close.
TRUDY: Yeah we are. Look at my instruments.
GRACE: Yup. We're in the flux vortex.
NORM: Oh. My. God.
TRUDY: You should see your face.
GRACE: Jake, take number two, it's the least glitchy. Norm, I need you to operate Jake's link.
JAKE: Hey. You got a problem?
NORM: I trained three years for this mission. I speak the language fluently. He falls off the frickin' turnip truck and all of a sudden he's cultural It's not our choice, Norm.
GRACE: It's not our choice, Norm.
NORM: Yeah, well I didn't come out here to wash the dishes while you're on some interspecies booty call.
GRACE: He can't go far.
GRACE: Let's get you in.
JAKE: Holy shit.
NEYTIRI: Do not look in her eye.
NEYTIRI: Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter in the whole life.
NEYTIRI: To become taronyu Hunter you must choose your own ikran. And he must choose When you are ready.
JAKE: When you are ready.
NEYTIRI: When you are ready.
NEYTIRI: Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee DROPS off the branch. It swoops down across the forest canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a power climb.
JAKE: Do I have to do this? I need some rack.
GRACE: No now, when it's fresh.
JAKE: Yeah, yeah. The days are starting to blur together. The language is a bitch, but I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.
JAKE: She touches her nose, her ears, her eyes in quick sequence.
JAKE: Ontu, mikyun, nari.
NORM: Thank you?
JAKE: Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation.
NORM: Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo. You've gotta roll the R, r-r-r-oll it.
GRACE: ( Na'vi, subtitled ) I See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite.
NEYTIRI: I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.
NEYTIRI: When you hear nothing, you will hear everything. When you see nothing, you will See everything.
OMIITED: NEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth. She points and he parts some leaves to see
JAKE: ( SMIRKING ) I just hope this treehugger shit isn't on the final.
GRACE: ( without looking up ) This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there. You need to listen to what she says. Try to see the forest through their eyes.
JAKE: Excuse me this is my video-log here,
JAKE: ( NA'VI ) I See you Brother, and thank you. Your spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays behind to become part of the People.
NEYTIRI: A clean kill. You are ready.
GRACE: You're still losing weight. Here
JAKE: I made a kill today. We ate it. I know where that meal came from.
GRACE: Other body. You need to take care of this body.
JAKE: Yeah yeah.
GRACE: Jake, I'm serious you look like crap. You're burning too hard.
JAKE: Get rid of this shit, then you can lecture me.
GRACE: I'm telling you, as your boss and someone who might even consider being a friend someday, to take some down time.
JAKE: Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya.
GRACE: Yeah you're gonna go ride a banshee. Or die trying.
JAKE: That's right, Grace. This is what I've been working for.
GRACE: And this is your check up from the neck up, Marine. You're getting in way too Trust me, I learned the hard way.
JAKE: What did happen at the school?
GRACE: Neytiri's sister Sylwanin stopped coming to school. She was angry about the clear-cutting.
GRACE: One day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in, all painted up they'd set a bulldozer on fire I guess they thought I could protect them.
GRACE: The troopers pursued them to the
GRACE: They killed Sylwanin in the doorway. Right in front of Neytiri. Then shot the I got most of the kids out, before they shot me.
JAKE: Jake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and desperately trying to hide it.
GRACE: Jake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and desperately trying to hide it.
GRACE: A scientist stays objective we can not be ruled by emotion. But I poured ten years of my life into that school. They called me sa'atenuk. Mother. That kind of pain reaches back through the link.
GRACE: It's a job. Learn what you can but don't get attached.
GRACE: It's not our world, Jake. And we can't stop what's coming.
JAKE: We doin' this?
TSU'TEY: Jakesully will go first.
NEYTIRI: ( WHISPERING ) Now you choose your ikran. This you must feel inside. If he also chooses you, move quick, like I showed. You will have one chance.
JAKE: How will I know if he chooses me?
NEYTIRI: He will try to kill you.
JAKE: Out of sight of Tsu'tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes it. Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like it didn't happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with
JAKE: Let's dance.
JAKE: That's right! You're mine.
NEYTIRI: First flight seals the bond. You cannot
JAKE: THWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS as they PLUMMET off the cliff the banshee WAILS and
JAKE: Shut the hell up!!
JAKE: Level out! Fly straight!
GRACE: The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial predator. Not only rare, but the sightings tend not to get reported.
TRUDY: There usually isn't time to key the mike.
JAKE: The People call it Toruk.
NORM: ( TRANSLATING ) Last Shadow.
JAKE: Last one you ever see.
TRUDY: I saw one take out a gunship once WHAM! Total frickin' yard sale. Ate the crew like peanuts.
JAKE: That's it.
GRACE: Vitraya Ramunong The Well of Souls. It's their most sacred place.
GRACE: Something big is going on in there, biologically. I'd die to get samples, but outsiders are strictly forbidden.
TRUDY: They're coming back.
TRUDY: If you don't give him something, he's gonna shut us down.
JAKE: Hey, guys.
NEYTIRI: My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk Macto Rider of Last Shadow. Toruk chose him. It has only happened five times since the time of the First Songs.
JAKE: That's a long time.
NEYTIRI: Toruk Macto was mighty he brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow. All Na'vi people know this story.
GRACE: Watch that stuff. It'll knock you into next week.
TSU'TEY: I thought enough drink you would not be so ugly.
JAKE: Tsu'tey looks deep into the fire.
TSU'TEY: Your warriors hide inside machines fight from far away. I did not think a sky person could be
NEYTIRI: You must dance! It is the way.
MO'AT: ( SUBTITLED ) We cannot let this seed grow. Her path is with Tsu'tey.
JAKE: ( to the lens ) I can barely remember my old life. I'm not sure who I am anymore.
SELFRIDGE: Good of you to stop by. How's it going out there? Our blue friends all packed up yet?
SELFRIDGE: See, I keep hooking it. It's the damn
SELFRIDGE: The low gravity and the high air density cancel out so
JAKE: You called us back to report you want to hear it or not?
SELFRIDGE: Go ahead.
GRACE: Jake is making incredible progress, years worth in just a few months. But we need more time.
SELFRIDGE: Not what I was hoping to hear.
GRACE: Parker, it's their ancestral home. They've lived there since before human history began. You can spare them a few more weeks.
SELFRIDGE: This thing is inevitable. What does it matter when it happens? I'm sorry, Dr. Augustine. You're out of time.
QUARITCH: You're not gettin' lost in the woods, are you son?
QUARITCH: Your last report was two weeks ago. I'm starting to doubt your resolve. From what I see, it's time to terminate this
JAKE: No. I can do this.
QUARITCH: Look, you've given me plenty of usable intel. Like this "Well of Souls" place I've got them by the balls with that, when it turns into a shit-fight. Which it
QUARITCH: So you'll get your legs back, like I
SHOULDER ): It's time to come in.
JAKE: I've gotta finish this thing. There's one more test the Dream Hunt. It's the final stage of becoming a man. Then I'm one of them. They'll trust what I say.
JAKE: . and I can negotiate the terms of their relocation.
QUARITCH: Then you need to get it done, Corporal.
GRACE: Jake, I can't allow this. You're just not strong enough.
JAKE: It's the last door I'm going through it. You can help me or get out of the
GRACE: ( grabbing him ) Will you listen to me? Sometimes the Na'vi themselves die in these vision quests. The venom takes you to the edge of death.
NORM: Calibrating. Thirty seconds.
GRACE: No matter what you prove out there you are still in here. Right here.
JAKE: I have to go all the way become one of
THEM: ( FURIOUSLY ) Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of
GRACE: ( FURIOUSLY ) Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of
GRACE: Our life out there takes millions of dollars of machinery to sustain. You visit and you leave.
GRACE: ( SOFTENING ) You can never truly be with her.
JAKE: You know why I'm here? Because Quaritch sent me.
NORM: That's right to embed with the Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them out of their home. By deceit or by force, he didn't care. And if it turned out to be force, then how best to do it.
JAKE: That's right to embed with the Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them out of their home. By deceit or by force, he didn't care. And if it turned out to be force, then how best to do it.
GRACE: And what about now, Jake?
JAKE: I'm not that guy any more.
GRACE: I know.
JAKE: But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he yanks me out I never see her again. And if I tell her the truth, the clan throws me out that's if they don't cut my heart out and show it to me.
NORM: They won't understand what you've done.
JAKE: They don't even have a word for "lie" they had to learn it from us.
GRACE: I know. I taught it to them.
JAKE: ( PLEADING ) Grace. I've gotta go. They're waiting.
NORM: Link is ready.
GRACE: Jake. You can't carry this burden much It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind probably can't survive the Dream Hunt
JAKE: ( smiling wanly ) It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind probably can't survive the Dream Hunt
GRACE: ( to Norm ) Prep my link. I'm going in.
NEYTIRI: When your Spirit Animal comes, you will
MO'AT: ( SUBTITLED ) Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree bless this worthy Hunter with a true
MO'AT: It is finished.
EYTUKAN: ( SUBTITLED ) Did your Spirit Animal come?
MO'AT: ( to Jake ) Something has come. ( to the others, subtitled ) It will take time for the meaning to be
EYTUKAN: ( SUBTITLED ) You are now a son of the Omaticaya. You are part of the People.
NEYTIRI: This is a place for prayers to be heard. And sometimes answered.
JAKE: It's like a sound you feel.
NEYTIRI: We call this utraya mokri the Tree of Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who live within Eywa.
NEYTIRI: You are Omaticaya now. You may make your own bow from the wood of Hometree. And you may choose a woman.
NEYTIRI: We have many fine women. Ninat is the best singer
JAKE: I don't want Ninat.
NEYTIRI: There is Beyral she is a good hunter
JAKE: I've already chosen. But this woman must also choose me.
NEYTIRI: She already has.
NEYTIRI: Kissing is very good. But we have something better.
JAKE: Neytiri, you know my real body is far away, sleeping.
NEYTIRI: This body is real. This spirit is real.
NEYTIRI: When I was first your teacher, I hated all Sky People. But you have also taught Spirit is all that matters.
NEYTIRI: I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for We are?
JAKE: We are?
NEYTIRI: Yes. It is our way.
JAKE: Really, we are?
NEYTIRI: We are.
JAKE: It's cool. I'm there.
NEYTIRI: Jake! Wake up! Where ever you are, come back to me now. Jake!
GRACE: Here eat this. I'd hate to have to force-feed a cripple.
GRACE: ( GRINNING ) She's not going anywhere.
GRACE: And when was the last time you took a shower? Jesus, Marine.
JAKE: Hey! Heeeey! Stop! Stop!
OPERATOR: Hey, I got one of the natives blockin' my blade here.
SUPERVISOR: ( to Selfridge ) What do we do?
SELFRIDGE: Roll on. He'll move. These people have to learn that we don't stop.
OPERATOR: I'm blind.
QUARITCH: Freeze it, right there.
SELFRIDGE: Son of a bitch!
QUARITCH: Get me a pilot!
EYTUKAN: ( SUBTITLED ) Tsu'tey will lead the war party!
GRACE: ( SUBTITLED ) Please this will only make it worse
TSU'TEY: You do not speak here!
JAKE: ( to Neytiri, low ) Okay, listen. There's something I have to tell you. It's gonna be hard. I just need you to
TSU'TEY: Tsu'tey walks right up and SLAMS Jake in the chest with both hands. It is so unexpected, that Jake topples on his ass.
TSU'TEY: You mated with this woman?!
GRACE: Oh shit.
MO'AT: Is this true?
NEYTIRI: ( SUBTITLED ) We are mated before Eywa. It is done.
TSU'TEY: ( SUBTITLED ) Neytiri was promised to me! Everything is changing. Everything is being destroyed!
TSU'TEY: ( SUBTITLED ) These aliens kill everything they touch, like poison.
MO'AT: Neytiri! If you choose this path, you can never be Tsahik. Your life will be
NEYTIRI: I have chosen.
TSU'TEY: LUNGES AT JAKE, who's ready this time he sidesteps, blocking the knife, and elbows Tsu'tey HARD in the face.
EYTUKAN: ( SUBTITLED ) Stop! This is not a proper challenge.
TSU'TEY: I challenge you.
GRACE: Jake, don't
JAKE: I accept.
TRUDY: Loveshack this is Samson One Six inbound hot to your pos. I have Colonel Quaritch with me and
QUARITCH: Did I tell you to announce us?
TRUDY: Sorry sir, it's procedure.
NORM: Samson One Six? Trudy?
GRACE: What the hell are you doing?
JAKE: It's the only way to get him to goddamn
NORM: Hey, hang on, you can't interrupt a link in progress, it's dangerous wait!
JAKE: Are you out of your goddamn mind?!
QUARITCH: You crossed a line.
TSU'TEY: ( SUBTITLED ) This is a demon in a false body. It should not live.
QUARITCH: You let me down, son. You got a little local pussy and completely forgot what team you play for.
GRACE: Parker, listen, there may still be time Shut your fucking hole!
QUARITCH: Shut your fucking hole!
GRACE: Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot You need to muzzle your dog!
SELFRIDGE: Can we just take this down a couple notches, please.
JAKE: ( to Quaritch ) You say you want to keep your people alive. Start by listening to her.
GRACE: ( to Selfridge ) This is bad, Parker. Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine.
SELFRIDGE: You know what? You throw a stick in the air around here it falls on some sacred I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here I'm talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest.
GRACE: I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here I'm talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest.
SELFRIDGE: ( FRUSTRATED ) Which is what exactly?
GRACE: ( to Jake ) I can't do this. How am I supposed to reduce years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate?
JAKE: Just tell him what you know in your
GRACE: Alright, look I don't have the answers yet, I'm just now starting to even frame the questions. What we think we know is that there's some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees. Like the synapses between neurons. Each tree has ten to the fourth connections to the trees around it, and there are ten to the twelfth trees on Pandora
SELFRIDGE: That's a lot I'm guessing.
GRACE: That's more connections than the human brain. You get it? It's a network a global network. And the Na'vi can access it they can upload and download data memories at sites like the one you What the hell have you people been smoking out there? They're just. Goddamn. Trees.
SELFRIDGE: What the hell have you people been smoking out there? They're just. Goddamn. Trees.
GRACE: You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth of this world isn't in the ground it's all around us. The Na'vi know that, and they're fighting to defend it. If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them.
QUARITCH: We understand them just fine. Thanks to Jake here.
QUARITCH: Since a deal can't be made it gets real simple. So thanks. I'm getting all emotional. I might just give you a big wet kiss.
GRACE: Parker, we have to talk, like rational Well, I'd cherish that, but unfortunately you're out of here on the next shuttle. All of you. I'm shutting down the Avatar Program, effective now.
SELFRIDGE: Well, I'd cherish that, but unfortunately you're out of here on the next shuttle. All of you. I'm shutting down the Avatar Program, effective now.
WAINFLEET: They hit with banshees first. Set the ampsuit on fire. Driver's toast.
QUARITCH: The rest of the squad?
WAINFLEET: Six bodies that's all of `em. And the equipment is totalled.
SELFRIDGE: INT. SELFRIDGE'S OFFICE - DAY Selfridge is stares soberly as Quaritch outlines the plan.
QUARITCH: I can do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous. We'll clear them out with gas first. It'll be humane. More or
QUARITCH: Hey, don't go limp on me now. This is exactly the incident we needed.
SELFRIDGE: Alright, let's pull the trigger.
GRACE: They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose, to trigger a response. They're fabricating this war to get what they I can't believe that.
NORM: I can't believe that.
JAKE: Yup. That's how it's done. When people are sitting on shit you want, you make them your enemy. Then you're justified in taking it.
TRUDY: Sec-ops is rolling the gunships. They're gonna hit Hometree!
JAKE: Now. We're spooling up now! I gotta go.
TRUDY: Now. We're spooling up now! I gotta go.
GRACE: My God.
GRACE: Parker, wait. Stop! These are people you're about to
SELFRIDGE: They're fly-bitten savages who live in a tree! Look around I don't know about you but I see a lot of trees. They can For God's sake, there are children in there. Babies!
GRACE: For God's sake, there are children in there. Babies!
JAKE: Look Selfridge, you don't want this kind of blood on your hands. Let me try to talk them out. They trust me.
SELFRIDGE: You've got one hour. Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the axe comes down, you get them to evacuate. One
JAKE: ( SUBTITLED ) Eytukan, I have something to say, to ( SUBTITLED ) Speak, Jakesully.
EYTUKAN: ( SUBTITLED ) Speak, Jakesully.
JAKE: ( SUBTITLED ) A great evil is upon us. The Sky People are coming to destroy Hometree. They will be here soon.
JAKE: ( SUBTITLED ) You have to leave, or you will die.
MO'AT: Are you certain of this?
JAKE: They sent me here to learn your ways. So one day I could bring this message, and you would believe it.
NEYTIRI: What are you saying, Jake? You knew this would happen?
JAKE: ( ANGUISHED ) At first it was just orders. Then everything changed. I fell in love with the forest, with the Omaticaya ( he looks at her ) with you. And by then, how could I tell you?
NEYTIRI: I trusted you, Jake!
JAKE: Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to
NEYTIRI: You will never be one of the People!
NEVER!: TSU'TEY yells to his HUNTERS
TSUTEY: ( SUBTITLED ) Bind them.
QUARITCH: Well, I'd say diplomacy has failed.
QUARITCH: I think they mean to cut their throats if we don't back off. Make sure you get a nice close-up of that. I can tack it onto the after-action report.
JAKE: You have to get out of Hometree! Run to the forest! Please, I'm begging you!
EYTUKAN: ( SUBTITLED ) Take the ikran! Attack from above!
QUARITCH: Alright, let's get this done. Give me forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the front door.
GUNNER: Roger. CS forties. Going hot.
QUARITCH: On the Dragon's stub-wings the 40mm ROCKET LAUNCHERS open up with a BARRAGE of leaping fire which FLASHES down and
EYTUKAN: ( yelling/subtitled ) Everybody outside! Go to the Forest.
MO'AT: You are one of us. Help us!
JAKE: We've gotta move! He's gonna blow the
QUARITCH: That's how you scatter the roaches. Okay, switch missiles. Give me H-E's at the base of the west columns.
TRUDY: Screw it.
QUARITCH: Bring it down.
QUARITCH: Nice work people. Alright, let's light it up.
JAKE: Neytiri! Neytiri!
EYTUKAN: ( SUBTITLED ) Daughter take my bow. Protect the
JAKE: I'm sorry
NEYTIRI: Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never come back!
SELFRIDGE: Pull the plug.
MASTER BREAKER: EXT. RAINFOREST The strings are cut. Jake flops to the ground, limp.
MO'AT: ( SUBTITLED ) Bring her.
GRACE: They never wanted us to succeed.
TRUDY: Personally I think steak's too good for these traitors.
GUARD: They get steak? That's bullshit. Let me see that
TRUDY: ( shoving him down ) All the way down, pendejo.
MAX: That was unexpectedly satisfying.
NORM: Baby, you rock.
JAKE: ( to Max and Trudy )
JAKE: So what do you say? Time for a I'm free.
GRACE: I'm free.
JAKE: Come on.
JAKE: ( to Trudy ) Get your ship fired up.
JAKE: Stay here. I need somebody on the inside I can trust.
TROOPER: I need you to shut down and step out of the vehicle! Now!
JAKE: Take it nice and easy, troop.
JAKE: On the ground, face down. Hands behind your head.
GRACE: Do what he goddamn says!
JAKE: Go! Go! Go!
JAKE: Oh yeah, baby!
GRACE: Aaahh, crap. Not again.
GRACE: This is gonna ruin my whole day.
JAKE: Hang on, Grace.
TRUDY: Well, at least they won't be able to track us up here. Not this deep in the It's strongest at the Well of Souls, Good, `cause that's where we're going.
JAKE: It's strongest at the Well of Souls, Good, `cause that's where we're going.
TRUDY: Good, `cause that's where we're going.
JAKE: Good, `cause that's where we're going.
TRUDY: He gives Grace an ampule of morphine for the pain.
JAKE: I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.
GRACE: Forget it, it doesn't matter.
JAKE: No! The People can help you. I know it.
MO'AT: ( SUBTITLED ) Wise ancestors who live within Eywa, guide us. Give us a sign.
NORM: ( LOW ) Tsu'tey is Olo'eyctan now. He's not going to let you get near that place.
JAKE: I've gotta try, Norm.
JAKE: Come on, boy. Time to fly.
OMIITED: EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY THE GREAT LEONOPTERYX glides effortlessly along the ridge where Jake and Neytiri first encountered him.
NEYTIRI: ( breathing the words ) Toruk Macto.
NEYTIRI: ( SHOUTING ) Toruk Macto!
CROWD: Toruk Macto. Toruk Macto.
NEYTIRI: I See you.
JAKE: ( a hoarse whisper ) I See you.
NEYTIRI: I was afraid Jake for my people. I'm not any more.
JAKE: ( SUBTITLED ) Tsu'tey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I stand before you, ready to serve the ( then just for Tsu'tey ) You are Olo'eyctan, and you are the best warrior. I can't do this without you.
TSU'TEY: I will fly with you.
JAKE: JAKE turns to the MATRIARCH.
JAKE: Grace is dying. I beg the help of the Great Mother.
MO'AT: Bring her, Jakesully.
JAKE: Look where we are, Grace.
GRACE: ( with a wan smile ) I need to take some samples.
MO'AT: ( QUIETLY ) The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is
MO'AT: in this body.
JAKE: Is that possible?
MO'AT: Possible, yes. She must pass through the Eye of Eywa and return. But Jakesully she is very weak.
JAKE: Hang on, they're gonna fix you up.
GRACE: I always held back. But you gave them your heart. I'm proud of you, Jake.
GRACE: Help them. You do whatever it takes. You hear me?
JAKE: I will.
GRACE: I'm with her Jake she's real
JAKE: He sees the roots falling away from her human body.
MO'AT: Her wounds were too great, there was not enough time. She is with Eywa now.
JAKE: With your permission, I will Speak now. You would honor me by translating.
JAKE: The Sky People have sent a message that they can take whatever they want, and no one can stop them. But we will send them a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind can carry you, tell the other clans to come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to them. Fly now with me brothers and sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky People that this is our land!
QUARITCH: People, you are fighting for survival. There's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack. First slide.
QUARITCH: These orbital images show the hostiles' numbers have gone from a couple of hundred to over two thousand in one day, and more are pouring in. By next week it could be twenty thousand. Then they'll be overrunning our perimeter here. We can't wait. Our only security lies in pre- emptive attack. We will fight terror with terror.
QUARITCH: Next slide. This mountain stronghold is supposedly protected by their deity. When we destroy it, we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep they won't come within a thousand klicks of this place.
SELFRIDGE: This thing is completely out of control!
SELFRIDGE: Listen to me! I am not authorizing you to turn the mine-workers local into a freakin' militia!
QUARITCH: I declared threat condition red. That puts all on-world assets under my You think you can pull this palace coup shit on me?! I can have your ass with one call
SELFRIDGE: You think you can pull this palace coup shit on me?! I can have your ass with one call
QUARITCH: You're a long way from Earth.
QUARITCH: ( to his men ) Get him out of here.
SELFRIDGE: You touch me you're so fired.
MAX: I don't know how secure this channel is.
JAKE: Talk fast.
MAX: It's crazy here, Jake. It's full mobilization. They're rigging the shuttles as bombers. They've made up these big pallets of mine explosives. It's for some kind of shock and awe Frickin' daisycutters.
TRUDY: Frickin' daisycutters.
NORM: Holy shit.
JAKE: ( to Max ) Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can cut some kinda deal before this thing goes all the way.
MAX: No, Quaritch has taken over. He's rolling and there's no stopping him.
JAKE: Oh six hundred tomorrow.
MAX: Oh six hundred tomorrow.
JAKE: Max signs off.
NORM: We're screwed.
TRUDY: You know he's gonna commit those bombers straight to the Well of Souls.
JAKE: That's right. Because I gave it to him on a plate.
TRUDY: We both did.
NORM: If he takes out the Well of Souls it's over. It's their main line to Eywa, to their ancestors it'll destroy them.
JAKE: Then I guess we better stop him.
TRUDY: You need to get some rack.
JAKE: Gonna have to settle for coffee.
JAKE: ( Na'vi/subtitled ) Strike here and here.
TRUDY: ( LOW ) You know our chances suck.
JAKE: Going up against gunships with bows and What's your point?
TRUDY: Going up against gunships with bows and What's your point?
JAKE: What's your point?
TRUDY: ( NODDING )
JAKE: I've never done this in my life.
JAKE: And I'm probably just talking to a tree right now. But if you're there I need to give you a heads up.
JAKE: If Grace is there with you look in her memories she can show you the world we come from. There's no green there. They killed their Mother, and they're gonna do the same thing here.
JAKE: More Sky People are gonna come. They're gonna come like a rain that never ends
JAKE: until they've covered the world. Unless we stop them.
NEYTIRI: Our Great Mother does not take sides. She protects only the balance of life.
JAKE: It was worth a try.
WAINFLEET: Contact. Two hundred meters.
QUARITCH: Fire for effect.
HANDSET: Jake! Jake! We're falling back!
NORM: Jake! Jake! We're falling back!
QUARITCH: Blue team, switch forties. Fire at will.
TROOPERS: Yeah baby! Get some!
QUARITCH: Blue team, stay with the ground units. Red team, with me. We're punching for the main target.
TRUDY: You're not the only ones with guns, you
KABOOM!!: NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE is hit by GROUND-FIRE. It folds up like a broken kite, crashing down through branches and
QUARITCH: There it is. Valkyrie One, this is Dragon. Target is in sight.
TROOPER: Target in sight.
JAKE: We have to stop the shuttles, no matter what it takes.
WAINFLEET: I hear this is worse than death for you,
TROOPER: Right flank something's coming! It's all lit up out there.
JAKE: What the hell ?
JAKE: A GUNNER fires from the door of a Samson. There is a CRASH and the head of a BANSHEE lunges in the open door, jerking him out. Other banshees tear at the pilot's windshield.
WAINFLEET: A and C squads rally at my pos. I Who's screaming God damn it?!
WAINFLEET: Shutup you crybabies!
MAX: Rogue One, Rogue One, this is Max. Tell Jake we are in motion. Get in there. Barricade the door!
PILOT: Mains to a hundred percent! Get me
PILOT: We're good!
PILOT: Valkyrie Two is breaking off. And if any of ya'll want to get off this piece of shit planet, you better cover our ass, `cause we're the only way back to orbit.
GUNSHIP PILOT: Roger that.
QUARITCH: Get back here you worthless pukes!
PILOT: Are we breaking off?
QUARITCH: What do you think?
SELFRIDGE: ( in growing alarm ) What the hell is going on out there?
PILOT: Sir, all ground units are falling back to the LZ.
QUARITCH: Stay on target.
QUARITCH: Switch missiles. Arm all pods.
PILOT: Let's see what these blue bastards do when I bitch-slap their goddess.
QUARITCH: Let's see what these blue bastards do when I bitch-slap their goddess.
QUARITCH: ( to the pilot ) Put your mask on.
JAKE: ( into his headset ) Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of Souls! He's got a clear shot. Hit him, anybody that can! Do it now!
TRUDY: On it.
NORM: ( clipped, pilot-like ) Norm, I love you.
TRUDY: ( clipped, pilot-like ) Norm, I love you.
TROOPER: Dragon is down. It's off the board.
SELFRIDGE: What do you mean, off the board?!
SELFRIDGE: Oh shit.
QUARITCH: Nothing's over while I'm breathing.
JAKE: Kinda hoped you'd say that.
QUARITCH: How does it feel to betray your own race?
TSU'TEY: ( NA'VI ) I See you, Jakesully.
JAKE: I See you, Tsu'tey te Rongloa Ateyitan.
TSU'TEY: Are the people safe?
JAKE: They're safe.
TSU'TEY: I can never ride again, or bond with my woman or hear the voice of Eywa. I can not lead the People. You will lead them, No. I'm not officer material.
JAKE: No. I'm not officer material.
TSU'TEY: It is decided. Now do the duty of Olo'eyctan. Set my spirit free.
JAKE: I'm not killing you.
TSU'TEY: I am already dead.
JAKE: It is the way. And it is good. I will be
TSU'TEY: It is the way. And it is good. I will be
TSU'TEY: I fought with Toruk Macto, we were brothers and he was my last shadow.
JAKE: ( NA'VI ) Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the Mother Spirit.
JAKE: The science guys will keep the lights on, here. But I won't miss this place.
