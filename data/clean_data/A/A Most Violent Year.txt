SUNRISE: Open on ABEL MORALES. It is early morning and still almost dark out. He has a rugged yet prosperously-handsome face and is in his mid-thirties. He is struggling to get started with his morning jog.
JULIAN: Good morning. JULIAN speaks English with a well-sanded accent. Is it Central American or Mexican? The female collector gives him a He heads through the booth, but there is still traffic on the other side as the lanes merge together. Just as the traffic is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we see TWO GUYS come walking through the traffic and towards the cab. Before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps. The GUY on the driver's side, LOUIS SERVIDIO, is small and very slight but he moves with great speed and strength. He shatters the glass side window with his elbow. Unlocks the door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the passenger side, but he is holding a gun. They are not wearing masks. It's very brazen. Before THUG #2 even asks JULIAN to get out of the cab LOUIS SERVIDIO crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway. LOUIS SERVIDIO pulls the door shut and they drive away with the truck leaving JULIAN sitting in the middle of the road staring, as blood starts to flow from his jaw.
ABEL: You look very nice.
ANNA: You look very nice.
ABEL: You look very nice.
ANNA: Thank you.
ABEL: You sure?
ANNA: ABEL walks around and opens his trunk. He takes out two large empty briefcases. He carries the briefcases as they both walk over to a large, unmarked, armored van that is idling in the middle of the parking lot. Two ARMED GUARDS get out of the van. One is holding a clipboard. He walks up to ANNA and ABEL. He hands them the clipboard. They look at each other one last time and then both sign the document. The other GUARD opens up the back of the truck. ABEL hands him the briefcases and the guard begins to fill them with cash. Lots of cash. ABEL and ANNA stand at the open back of the van and just watch. Finally he finishes and hands the now- heavy cases to ABEL. ABEL picks up the two cases and walks a bit away from the truck. He turns to ANNA.
ABEL: We don't have any more money so what else could I do. She gives a small smile. He looks at his watch. They kiss.
ANDREW WALSH: So how are we this morning?
ABEL: ( gives a smile and nod )
ANDREW WALSH: Well I woke up feeling very good about this.
ABEL: They both take a look at their watches.
ANDREW WALSH: Well we are going all in. so now I love it. Gives him another slight smile. They stand around in awkward silence. Finally a late-model Ford Ltd. station wagon pulls into the lot.
JOSEPH: So why is it you want this land?
ABEL: I'm sorry?
JOSEPH: It has been difficult for you to get me here, no? Over a year?
ABEL: Almost two.
JOSEPH: There are many like it around? And thanks to all these tests you paid for, we now know it is as much of a mess below the ground as it is above. My people have looked at your books, I know this is a lot of money for you, so why have you kept on us so. just for this ugly and polluted little piece of the earth.
ABEL: I have been looking over my fence at this property for a very long So it is just proximity?
JOSEPH: So it is just proximity?
ABEL: No. I imagine I want it for the same reason you did.
JOSEPH: And what's that?
ABEL: To grow.
JOSEPH: Well, I am in the garment business so I appreciate that sentiment. But I inherited this land from my uncle. Sadly he had no children of his own. He was the one that let them build these tanks here. So this place can do little for me. in fact thanks to all those tests you've done it may be a liability. As you know I offered to lease the site to you at a fair price, but you were not interested?
ABEL: Why not?
JOSEPH: Why not?
ABEL: I like to own the things I use.
JOSEPH: I can see that. Long pause.
ABEL: Yes. This contract here, your lawyers have fully reviewed it?
JOSEPH: Yes. This contract here, your lawyers have fully reviewed it?
ANDREW WALSH: Of course.
JOSEPH: And you have brought the money? ( ABEL nodes yes ) So you realize you have only thirty days to close this transaction?
ABEL: I understand.
JOSEPH: I want you to know this up front. I am a very fair man but I believe in honoring contracts. You will fulfill your end of this contract and the property is yours. If you can't we will keep your money and will sell it to your competitor who has been chasing us almost as badly as you have. I like you, but know that the only reason I am choosing you is because of the favorable terms of this contract. So this is business. and when you sign I understand.
ABEL: I understand.
JOSEPH: Well then, let's see this money, and then I will sign these papers. ABEL turns to ANDREW and gives a slight nod. ANDREW pulls the black briefcase onto the table and opens it. It has seven hundred thousand dollars in cash in it. He slides it over to their side. The old man signs the contract and they shake EXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM PARKING LOT - DAY ABEL stands next to ANDREW's car.
ANDREW WALSH: It's not ours yet.
ABEL: It's not ours yet.
ANDREW WALSH: Well, it was a hell of a job just getting them to this point. It's a good day for us. Take a walk around. Enjoy it for a second. ANDREW gets in his car and drives away. ABEL looks around and decides to go for a little walk.
CONTRACTOR: There he is. He walks up behind him and they both look out in silence for a beat.
ABEL: There he is. He walks up behind him and they both look out in silence for a beat.
CONTRACTOR: Thank you.
ABEL: I mean it. You and your men should be very proud.
CONTRACTOR: We are.
ABEL: Most people don't have anything beautiful like this to show for their day's work. You are a lucky I am.
CONTRACTOR: I am.
ABEL: Well I thank you. my family will be very happy here.
CONTRACTOR: I hope so.
ABEL: Now I think I owe you some money.
CONTRACTOR: That may be true.
ABEL: It is. ABEL reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out a thick envelope of cash. As he does we see a transformation of his personality from pleasant philosopher to a direct voice of unquestioned authority.
CONTRACTOR: Well, I'll let you go. He says this as he leads him to the door.
ABEL: Well, I'll let you go. He says this as he leads him to the door.
CONTRACTOR: It's being replaced, as I mentioned to your wife, that was an error on our part. Congratulations on your Thank you.
ABEL: Thank you.
ANNA: They broke his jaw.
ABEL: Have they found the truck?
ANNA: Are you alright?
ABEL: Are you alright?
JULIAN: ( NODS YES )
ABEL: Have the police been here yet?
ANNA: He was left in the middle of the highway without a truck, they brought him in.
ABEL: Can you speak? ANNA'S temper is rising.
ANNA: Not for a couple days. Can I speak with you outside? ANNA heads out into the hallway. ABEL looks around a beat then follows.
ANNA: Did they sign the contract?
ABEL: And took the deposit?
ANNA: And took the deposit?
ABEL: So it's a go?
ANNA: So it's a go?
ABEL: ( he gives a nice nod yes )
ANNA: To you as well.
ABEL: To you as well.
ANNA: We have thirty days? He nods ever so slightly yes, and she gives him a knowing smile back of equal measure. We are beginning to see that they actually work quite well together.
ABEL: These fucking guys. This poor kid has been working his ass off.
ANNA: Do you want me to speak to my Brother about this?
ABEL: No.don't talk to him or your This can't continue.
ANNA: This can't continue.
ABEL: It won't.
ANNA: It will if we don't do something.
ABEL: I'm meeting with the D.A. in the Oh, fuck the D.A. He's more interested in coming after us than helping us. ABEL looks around in disapproval. She thinks this through and then looks in at JULIAN.
ANNA: Oh, fuck the D.A. He's more interested in coming after us than helping us. ABEL looks around in disapproval. She thinks this through and then looks in at JULIAN.
ABEL: No we are not.
ANNA: Really. because they are.
ABEL: Well I'm not. They look each other over. She then finally leans in and gives him a caring kiss, she walks off.
ANNA: And you're going out to check on the new house?
ABEL: He watches her walk away then looks back into the hospital room. He enters.
ABEL: I have to get going. JULIAN gives a nod.
ABEL: May I take it?
BEAT COP: Excuse me?
ABEL: May I take it now?
BEAT COP: Is it yours?
ABEL: BEAT COP
BEAT COP: Well, I'm sorry about that. Once the owner or an owner's representative files the claim form in Corona she's yours. again.
ABEL: So you guys have done what you needed to?
BEAT COP: And what was that?
ABEL: And what was that?
BEAT COP: I'm sorry?
ABEL: You just said you've done what you needed to. so what was it that you've done?
BEAT COP: ( looks back dumbfounded )
ABEL: Did you fingerprint or anything?
BEAT COP: No need, these guys always wear So you've done nothing.
ABEL: So you've done nothing.
BEAT COP: I'm not exactly sure, I just got here at four. My shift is actually So who's coming? They stare at each other, then the truck. ABEL then climbs up and we see he knows his way around the truck. He goes up top and opens and looks into a valve, the tank is empty.
ABEL: So who's coming? They stare at each other, then the truck. ABEL then climbs up and we see he knows his way around the truck. He goes up top and opens and looks into a valve, the tank is empty.
BEAT COP: The cop gets in his car and prepares to drive away.
ABEL: They stole the $6,000 of fuel that was in it. The cop leaves. ABEL is left standing on top of the truck in the parking lot alone with his battered truck. He looks down at the open loading valve and begins to come up with an idea. The sun is setting.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: Lawrence. Thank you for seeing us on such short notice.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: Of course. And Mr. Morales. Please sit. I didn't realize you were coming as well.
ANDREW WALSH: A.D.A. LAWRENCE So what can I do for you?
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: So what can I do for you?
ANDREW WALSH: We need your help.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: In what way?
ANDREW WALSH: Our trucks. They are being robbed.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: ( he looks over at DEPUTY
LANGE ): ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: We have a serious security issue.
DEPUTY LANGE: There have been a series of hijackings of bulk-fuel delivery A.D.A. LAWRENCE Our drivers are being put in A.D.A. LAWRENCE Mr. Walsh, as I know you know, this office has been investigating your entire industry.

ANDREW WALSH: Of course. There is an awkward pause as LAWRENCE decides how he should A.D.A. LAWRENCE And as much as I'd like to be able to help you, you know this is a police issue. It's not what we do I understand. But this is turning into an urgent and pressing matter for us.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: And as much as I'd like to be able to help you, you know this is a police issue. It's not what we do I understand. But this is turning into an urgent and pressing matter for us.
ANDREW WALSH: I understand. But this is turning into an urgent and pressing matter for us.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: A.D.A. LAWRENCE I'm not sure what you mean. There were more murders and rapes in this city last year then there ever have been, so if you have come to tell me that we have a urgent security issue here, trust me I'm aware. ABEL cuts in. He can't help himself.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I'm not sure what you mean. There were more murders and rapes in this city last year then there ever have been, so if you have come to tell me that we have a urgent security issue here, trust me I'm aware. ABEL cuts in. He can't help himself.
ABEL: My people are at risk just driving around in this city, just trying to do their jobs. And I. I have done everything you have asked of me. It's been two years since you first started investigating my company and I have spent thousands of dollars hiring lawyers for this and that to provide you with every piece of information your office has requested. And I expect that you have been asking the same from my competitors. So with all this information that you have gained. We are just asking if you have any idea who has been doing this to us?
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I don't. This sits unanswered.
ABEL: First, please know that we respect the work you are doing to try to help our business and the city. But also know I have never taken anything I haven't earned from anyone so when you say you've. He pulls himself back.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: Well yes and no. See, all that I can do is to try and put people away in the simplest and most economical way possible with the limited resources at my disposal. It doesn't really matter to us who it is or how we do it as long as it's progress.
ABEL: Well, it makes a difference to me.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I know it does. This city is a very difficult place to do business right now.
ABEL: This more conciliatory tone makes LAWRENCE think through his next reply for a long beat.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: You know. Mr. Morales you seem like a decent man, and because of that I'm really not comfortable just sitting here with you pretending that the elephant perched on the corner of my desk isn't there. LAWRENCE looks over at DEPUTY LANGE whose body language says `don't go down this road'. But he does.
ABEL: I understand. ABEL stands up to leave and ANDREW is still a little stunned but stands.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I'm sure you will. They turn to leave. And LAWRENCE has one more thought.
ABEL: I'm sorry?
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I'm just looking here through these reports. It looks like out of the nineteen registered heating oil companies in the city your trucks have been getting hit three to one.
ABEL: A.D.A. LAWRENCE So are you maybe doing something to bring this on yourself?
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: So are you maybe doing something to bring this on yourself?
ANDREW WALSH: Like what?

A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I have a lot of problems coming across my desk every day Mr. I'm sure you do.
ABEL: I'm sure you do.
ANDREW WALSH: Abel. Abel. He stops and turns.
ABEL: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: No. let's not overreact. We don't even know what they are bringing against us. It could be total bullshit, and they are just trying to use us along the way. This isn't anything yet.
ABEL: I know.
ANNA: How'd it go?
ABEL: The DA. He said he's going to bring down charges on us next week.
ANNA: For what?
ABEL: We don't know yet.
ANNA: Who else?
ABEL: Right now they are just saying us. Where are we exposed?
ANNA: We follow standard industry practice on every front.
ABEL: I need to know what they are saying we did. INT. HOSPITAL LONG HALLWAY - DAY ABEL walks down the long hallway and enters a room.
ANNA: I need to know what they are saying we did. INT. HOSPITAL LONG HALLWAY - DAY ABEL walks down the long hallway and enters a room.
ABEL: INT. HOSPITAL LONG HALLWAY - DAY ABEL walks down the long hallway and enters a room.
ABEL: I'm very sorry this happened. Do you need anything else? ( JULIAN nods no ) If you do, you call the office. Okay then. He turns to leave and walks back to the stairs.
JULIAN: ABEL turns and looks at him.
ABEL: I don't.
JULIAN: I. I'm not sure I will be able.
ABEL: You will. JULIAN changes the subject.
JULIAN: Did you get the truck back?
ABEL: Yes. They took the load.
JULIAN: This is the sixth one?
ABEL: Seventh. you get some rest.
ARNOLD KLINE: Well, look who it is.
ABEL: ARNOLD KLINE
ARNOLD KLINE: Just a touch off the side Jimmy. Not all of us are as lucky as Mr. Morales here in terms of keeping our hair.
BARBER JIMMY: You're a good looking man.
ARNOLD KLINE: I know I am. So I hear congratulations are in order?
ABEL: What's that?
ARNOLD KLINE: You got yourself in contract over We are working on it.
ABEL: We are working on it.
ARNOLD KLINE: Thirty day close I hear, you better We are, thanks for your concern.
ABEL: We are, thanks for your concern.
ARNOLD KLINE: I saw a couple of your trucks over in Rego Park the other day. This brings ABEL around to look at him square.
ABEL: Really? When was that?
ARNOLD KLINE: A couple times.
ABEL: It's possible.
ARNOLD KLINE: Is it?
ABEL: ARNOLD KLINE
ARNOLD KLINE: That's a tough market.
ABEL: It is.
ARNOLD KLINE: My father struggled for years before he broke in there.
ABEL: Any new market is a tough one. I'll see you. ABEL walks out of the shop and looks around. It is now dark EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NEXT MORNING ABEL is jogging again but this time he is deep in the woods. He runs along the road. We then hear a car coming from behind him. The car noise then turns into more of a truck noise. He stops and turns around as we see a large truck coming towards He gets himself over to the side of the road. We have a slight fear it might hit him. But as it passes we see it's a large moving truck. There's a second one following right behind it.
ANNA: I know it has been a long road, and that not all of you wanted to do this, but thank you. For me.
ABEL: A toast. All six raise a glass.
PETER FORENTE: So you made the move? ABEL turns and sees PETER FORENTE standing there. He's in his mid-forties, very well-dressed, and handsomely bald.
ABEL: Peter. it's official as of ABEL picks up his coffee, and they both walk back over to the sideline together. Although they are standing a bit off to the side from everyone else.
COUNTER PERSON: ABEL picks up his coffee, and they both walk back over to the sideline together. Although they are standing a bit off to the side from everyone else.
PETER FORENTE: So I heard about your rig getting picked off again.
ABEL: PETER FORENTE
PETER FORENTE: We should probably get together to discuss this and go over some of the preventative measures that we've been taking. We haven't had an incident since November. It doesn't do any of us any good to have this kind of attention brought to us. They both stare out at the court for beat.
ABEL: That's possible.
PETER FORENTE: The driver looked like a member of the Hitler Youth. I haven't seen a teamster that blond and blue-eyed since I was a kid.
ABEL: He's from Ohio. Played football. I like my drivers to fit in with the That's new territory for you, no? This brings them both back in to look at each other.
PETER FORENTE: That's new territory for you, no? This brings them both back in to look at each other.
ABEL: Just picked up a few new accounts over there. Weekend houses of some old clients from in the city. PETER gives a bit of a stronger look. Then finally turns back towards the field.
PETER FORENTE: Which one is yours?
ABEL: Right there. They look out.
PETER FORENTE: She's beautiful.
ABEL: Thank you.
PETER FORENTE: Welcome to the neighborhood. You should be proud.
ABEL: PETER FORENTE
PETER FORENTE: INT. GARAGE OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY The garage is filled with boxes. ABEL stands in the middle of a few that are partially unpacked. He has set up an old radio in the corner of the garage, and it is playing a New York Giants football game. ABEL takes an object out of one of the boxes and looks at it with significance. Coming from the main house we hear the doorbell ring. ABEL'S oldest daughter, ANNIE, comes to the door of the garage.
ANNIE: Dad. Mr. Walsh is here. ABEL looks around behind ANNIE to see ANDREW standing there. He waves him into the garage. The boxes are stacked almost to the ceiling around them.
ANDREW WALSH: I'm sorry for the dramatic drop in but your phone doesn't seem to be It's not set up yet. So I am guessing this isn't good news here on a Sunday night.
ABEL: It's not set up yet. So I am guessing this isn't good news here on a Sunday night.
ANDREW WALSH: No. It looks like they are coming after us.
ABEL: That describes many people at this Slight smile.
ANDREW WALSH: The D.A.
ABEL: How bad?
ANDREW WALSH: I still haven't seen it yet. But my guy in his office just gave me a heads up an hour ago. It's not Where are we exposed?
ABEL: Where are we exposed?
ANDREW WALSH: I'm not sure, a couple places A couple places? This hits ABEL. He thinks for a beat than goes over to the door to the house and calls for his wife.
ABEL: A couple places? This hits ABEL. He thinks for a beat than goes over to the door to the house and calls for his wife.
ANNA: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: Anna. sorry you've got no phone.
ABEL: As of tomorrow I'll have my new radio hooked up though so you should be able to reach me wherever I am. He is making light of the situation, but as she looks at their faces she knows there is a problem.
ANDREW WALSH: The D.A. is going to bring down charges on us tomorrow.
ANNA: For what?
ANDREW WALSH: We don't know yet.
ANNA: Who else?
ANDREW WALSH: Right now they are just saying us.
ABEL: Where are we exposed? ABEL looks at his wife. She looks at ANDREW.
ANNA: We follow standard industry practice on every front. They all give each other a long look, as this means they have been bending the rules in several places, as do all their What does that mean?
ABEL: What does that mean?
ANNA: You know what that means.
ANDREW WALSH: It means we may have some accounting exposure where we have pushed things a little too far.
ABEL: How far?
ANDREW WALSH: You always told us to push until we couldn't push any further. Well, we may have hit that line. So we will handle it and move on.
ABEL: ABEL shoots her a stinging worried glance.
ANNA: I need to know what they are saying we did.
ANDREW WALSH: Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. You have always followed standard industry practices. We aren't even sure what this is yet. I just wanted to make sure you had all the information I do. This is a badge of honor, it means we are big enough to give a shit about now. Don't worry. That sits for a beat.
ABEL: Thank you for coming by Andrew. ABEL reaches into his pocket and takes out a remote for the automatic garage door opener. As it opens you can see the pride in his face as this remote is a fairly high-tech new item. They all sit and watch as it opens the whole way then stops in silence. ANDREW is now standing outside in the driveway.
ANNA: Thank you for coming by Andrew. ABEL reaches into his pocket and takes out a remote for the automatic garage door opener. As it opens you can see the pride in his face as this remote is a fairly high-tech new item. They all sit and watch as it opens the whole way then stops in silence. ANDREW is now standing outside in the driveway.
ANDREW WALSH: Very impressive.
ABEL: Thank you.
ANNA: It only cost him a year of the kid's tuition.
ANDREW WALSH: And one more thing. I got a call from the union. O'Leary. This grabs both their attention.
ANNA: What word?
ANDREW WALSH: There is real concern about their All of them.
ABEL: All of them.
ANNA: All of them.
ANDREW WALSH: The drivers are feeling Because they are.
ANNA: Because they are.
ANDREW WALSH: I just think you should talk to them about it. Before it grows into Good night.
ABEL: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: Good night.
ANNA: What's he doing?
ABEL: Quiet. don't worry. It's nothing. ANNA tries to go back to sleep.
ABEL: Quiet. It's nothing. Come down He snaps his fingers and calls the dog. The dog finally comes down the stairs. ABEL now heads towards the kitchen in a relaxed state, but then the dog starts growling again and looking out the windows next to the front door. ABEL comes over, he opens the front door but the dog refuses to go out.
ANNA: Where were you?
ABEL: ( looking to the dog ) A lot of help you were.
ANNA: They both look down at his bare feet. He has been in some kind of shock and hasn't even noticed that his bare feet are cut up to pieces from running in the woods through the ice. His feet are bleeding all over the walkway.
ANNA: Who was it?
ABEL: What do you mean, how am I supposed to know who it was? She gives him a look.
ANNA: If you.
ABEL: Ouch! If they had wanted to send a message he could have. and he Seems like a message was sent loud and clear.
ANNA: Seems like a message was sent loud and clear.
ABEL: Please. Don't get going on this. We are a big new house. He probably wanted the TV. He didn't have a gun, he had nothing. The alarm will be in on Monday. It was some kid. They aren't coming back. She looks at him with considerable concern. He leans in and starts kissing her. She holds still at first then gives in.
ABEL: What you are looking for here is the opening to the burn chamber. Now at this point you have not tipped your hat in anyway. From the minute you walked in the house you should have been working to create an impression of total impartiality. But now. He reaches over and opens the small door. A fire is burning inside. On cue the instructor hands ABEL a crisp clean white When this door opens you begin to close. It must always be spotless. If they see you have ever done this before it is over. He takes it and reaches up into a small exhaust chimney.
INSTRUCTOR: Do you hear that noise. that's the noise.
ABEL: It means you are close. Then after sitting in silence way longer than is comfortable, you turn. And say "I'd love to run a few numbers for you. Is there somewhere more comfortable we could sit." They will almost always take you to the dining room table and will offer you something. And whatever it is you always take the fancy option.
INSTRUCTOR: Can I get you a coffee or tea?
ABEL: A tea please.
INSTRUCTOR: We have some homemade lemonade or a I'd love a lemonade, thank you.
ABEL: I'd love a lemonade, thank you.
ABEL: Because, we are never going to be the cheapest option, so we have to be the best. And they want. no, need. to feel that you want the best too. That's why our trucks are the newest or cleanest, and our drivers are approachable. Just then the woman who works behind the front desk ( STANDARD FRONT DESK ) comes to the door.
ABEL: I gotta go, but the final point I will make is the hardest one. Once you have done the math and shown them what we can save them over the long haul through proper maintenance, you need them to sign. And the problem is by hiring you that means they are firing someone else. And that's never easy. So to get them over the line you need to close them. So when you show them the number look up at them both. and just stare at them. ABEL begins staring at the recruits. He continues to stare.
ABEL: Good morning. First off, I picked up Julian yesterday and he is back home and doing much better. And I just wanted to make sure you are all aware that we are doing everything we can to deal with this situation. We are working with law enforcement, and they seem to be closing in on these guys. But, sadly these are the times we are living in and we must rise above them. So, on that front we have He puts one of the new radios on the dais. ANDREW comes into the room behind ABEL and stands.
BACK ): Yes, Eddy.
ABEL: We have been in constant contact with the union and they aren't considering any new course of action at this time.
ABEL: EXT. ABEL AND ANNA'S HOUSE - DAY ANNA is walking back from the mailbox looking through the day's mail. As she approaches the house she looks up and sees the two younger daughters, ELIZABETH ( 6 years old ) and CATHERINE ( 4 years old ), playing in front of the house. CATHERINE comes out from under a bush near the side door with something in her hand. ANNA looks back down at the mail. As she gets closer to the house we see a look of concern come across her face. The look then turns to one of complete horror but as she gets closer to CATHERINE she tries to control her emotions.
ANNA: Catherine. Catherine. Katie! She drops the mail. And goes right up to her daughter.
CATHERINE: As ANNA comes up to CATHERINE we now see that the little girl is holding a large very real looking handgun in her little hands. ANNA is besides herself.
ANNA: Where did you get this? Catherine where did you find this?
CATHERINE: Right here. The little girl points over towards the bushes near the side door where LOUIS SERVIDIO was hiding and got hit the night Show me. The little girl walks over to bushes and kneels down.
ANNA: Show me. The little girl walks over to bushes and kneels down.
CATHERINE: It was just sitting right here. ANNA turns to the middle daughter, ELIZABETH.
ANNA: Did you see this?
ELIZABETH: Yeah, she went under there to get that ball and came out with it.
ANNA: ANNA yells towards in the house.
ELIZABETH: What is it? ANNA walks towards the front door to retrieve the NANNY
ANNA: Mom, is it real?
ELIZABETH: Mom, is it real?
ABEL: What is that?
ANNA: A gun. It's a gun Abel.
ABEL: Where did you get it?
ANNA: Your youngest daughter found it in the bushes outside our front door. She was playing with it. ABEL is totally speechless.
ABEL: Let me see that. I'll take care of Damn right we will. Who is this?
ANNA: Damn right we will. Who is this?
ABEL: I don't know, but I will take care of it.
ANNA: What does that mean you will take care of it. This isn't a brick through our car window or some other cute little warning that I've put up with in the past. This is your daughter playing with a loaded He turns back quickly. And stares at her.
ABEL: ( YELLS )
ANNA: You better. Because you won't like what's going to happen once I start getting involved. This causes him to stop in his tracks. He turns very You are not to tell your father about this. She looks back at him with a tinge of a smile.
ABEL: You are not to tell your father about this. She looks back at him with a tinge of a smile.
ANNA: .I won't. ANDREW comes to the door and knocks.
ANDREW WALSH: Can I talk with you both?
ANNA: I found a gun outside our front door. Somebody left it there last I don't know. ANNA looks over to ANDREW letting him know her disgust.
ANDREW WALSH: I don't know. ANNA looks over to ANDREW letting him know her disgust.
ABEL: I don't know. ANNA looks over to ANDREW letting him know her disgust.
ANDREW WALSH: He looks around then closes the door behind him and gets their attention.
ABEL: That truck just went out filthy. ABEL looks out the window as a truck leaves the yard.
ANNA: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: We are going to owe them some This brings him back.
ABEL: How much?
ANDREW WALSH: That depends on a bunch of factors. But that's an accounting question. They both look to ANNA
ABEL: You need to get home and start going through our set of books. How far back are they going?
ANDREW WALSH: Seems like all the way back to when you bought out Anna's father.
ANNA: I'll get into it.
ABEL: What is O'Leary doing here?. Abel looks to ANDREW.
ANDREW WALSH: He's been wanting to talk to you for days.
ABEL: ( under his breath ) ABEL gets up to go out. As ANDREW shuffles to leave ANNA
ANNA: Andrew can I talk to you for a ABEL leaves and they stay.
ABEL: How are you Bill?
BILL O'LEARY: I'm ok. Can't say I'm used to making house calls like this anymore though.
ABEL: I would have come to see you.
BILL O'LEARY: That's alright. You've got bigger things to worry about. ( Long pause ) So, I can't have this situation with your guys continuing.
ABEL: My guys.
BILL O'LEARY: Your drivers.
ABEL: Good. I would love you to help on this. Because I can't have it going on any longer either.
BILL O'LEARY: So let them protect themselves, that would stop all this very I respectfully disagree.
ABEL: I respectfully disagree.
BILL O'LEARY: They are picking on your men because they are just sitting there. weak.
ABEL: They are taking shots at me because I am growing, expanding, getting stronger not weaker. This frustrates Bill because he knows ABEL is right. He tries a new tack.
BILL O'LEARY: It's quite simple for me: I can't have my drivers getting hit like this. It looks like I can't protect Well, it appears that you can't. This is a little too sharp for the head of the NYC teamster's I can. And will. Because of all my job descriptions that is the one I consider most sacred.
ABEL: Well, it appears that you can't. This is a little too sharp for the head of the NYC teamster's I can. And will. Because of all my job descriptions that is the one I consider most sacred.
BILL O'LEARY: I can. And will. Because of all my job descriptions that is the one I consider most sacred.
ABEL: I agree. But these are truck drivers, not soldiers, this will lead to chaos.
BILL O'LEARY: It will stop immediately.
ABEL: No, it won't.
BILL O'LEARY: You seem to be under pressure from many sides right now. which I understand. Trust me I understand. So let me think this through. But whatever decision I make on this, it stands. Those men show up every morning for you because I tell them to. It's important for you to realize that these are very dangerous times, and we need to adapt. It's not like when we were Sometimes the weak man is the stronger man if he has the right It may seem that way. but if you are weak eventually it will show. it always does. And if you want this to all be behind us, help me find out who is doing this. You know a lot of people, and that would be the most help to me.
ABEL: BILL O'LEARY
BILL O'LEARY: Sometimes the weak man is the stronger man if he has the right It may seem that way. but if you are weak eventually it will show. it always does. And if you want this to all be behind us, help me find out who is doing this. You know a lot of people, and that would be the most help to me.
ABEL: It may seem that way. but if you are weak eventually it will show. it always does. And if you want this to all be behind us, help me find out who is doing this. You know a lot of people, and that would be the most help to me.
BILL O'LEARY: It's not always as simple as it I'm sure that's true.
ABEL: I'm sure that's true.
BILL O'LEARY: It is. well, I got to get going.
ABEL: Thank you for coming Bill.
ANDREW WALSH: How did that go?
BILL O'LEARY: Not well.
ANDREW WALSH: He feels very strongly about this.
BILL O'LEARY: I can see that.
ANDREW WALSH: I don't think he fully understands What's to understand?
BILL O'LEARY: What's to understand?
ANDREW WALSH: It's illegal.
BILL O'LEARY: It's not illegal if I say it isn't. My responsibility is to provide safe and timely passage of goods and products into and around this city. And because of this situation it is appearing to those whose opinions I care about that I can't do my job. That can not and will not continue.
ANDREW WALSH: I understand.
BILL O'LEARY: So talk to him. You need to protect yourself. This is very serious. Just know that. ANDREW thinks this through.
ANDREW WALSH: How would this work?
BILL O'LEARY: What does that mean?
ANDREW WALSH: I guess I'm not even sure exactly what you are suggesting.
BILL O'LEARY: Are you kidding me with this?
ANDREW WALSH: BILL O'LEARY ANDREW WALSH
BILL O'LEARY: Every driver in your fleet gets a And a permit? O'LEARY nods yes.
ANDREW WALSH: And a permit? O'LEARY nods yes.
BILL O'LEARY: By Friday.
ANDREW WALSH: Are the permits legit?
BILL O'LEARY: That depends what they do with it. If they kill their wife with them, then no. Then that is a very fake permit, and I'll walk away very quickly. But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop.
ANDREW WALSH: Who is it?
BILL O'LEARY: I don't fucking know.
ANDREW WALSH: I'll talk to him.
ANNA: He's not here. Her face fills with building anger as she hears.
ANDREW WALSH: How did that go?
BILL O'LEARY: Not well.
ANDREW WALSH: He feels very strongly about this.
BILL O'LEARY: I can see that.
ANDREW WALSH: I don't think he fully understands What's to understand?
BILL O'LEARY: What's to understand?
ANDREW WALSH: It's illegal.
BILL O'LEARY: It's not illegal if I say it isn't. This takes ANDREW back a step.
ANDREW WALSH: I understand.
BILL O'LEARY: So talk to him. You need to protect yourself. As a company.
ANDREW WALSH: I will try to talk with him.
BILL O'LEARY: This is very serious. Just know ANDREW WALSH thinks this through.
ANDREW WALSH: How would this work?
BILL O'LEARY: What does that mean?
ANDREW WALSH: I guess I'm not even sure exactly what you are suggesting.
BILL O'LEARY: Are you kidding me with this?
ANDREW WALSH: BILL O'LEARY ANDREW WALSH
BILL O'LEARY: Every driver in your fleet gets a And a permit? O'LEARY nods yes.
ANDREW WALSH: And a permit? O'LEARY nods yes.
BILL O'LEARY: By Friday.
ANDREW WALSH: Are the permits legit?
BILL O'LEARY: That depends what they do with it. If they kill their wife with them, then no. Then that is a very fake permit, and I'll walk away very quickly. But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop.
ANDREW WALSH: Who is it?
BILL O'LEARY: I don't fucking know.
ANDREW WALSH: They just got another truck.
ABEL: I know.
ANDREW WALSH: Who was driving?
ABEL: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: Is he alright?
ABEL: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: The drivers' security aside. this shit is starting to have a very significant financial effect on us here. It can't continue.
ABEL: I know.
ANDREW WALSH: How was your talk? ( nothing ) I spoke with him after. He's going to keep going `til he gets the answer he's looking for.
ABEL: I said I wouldn't do it. They sit for a long beat.
ANDREW WALSH: I'm not sure we are in a position to say that.
ABEL: What's that? ANDREW looks around. He's getting paranoid.
ANDREW WALSH: Do you want to go for a walk?
ABEL: Are you really serious with this, this is what it's come to, walking around outside like fucking I am and it is.
ANDREW WALSH: I am and it is.
ANDREW WALSH: It is looking like we must do this.
ABEL: I must? This gets a little personal.
ANDREW WALSH: They will shut you down.
ABEL: These men, they work for me. These trucks they drive, the customers they serve. They are here because we built this.
ANDREW WALSH: That's true, until its not. And the last person in the world right now that we need working against us is the president of the fucking teamsters. This company is out of business in a month if he gets these guys to walk. We are running out of cash.
ABEL: What are you even talking about The union provides a handgun and a permit to every one of the drivers. And they think this whole thing is over in a week.
ANDREW WALSH: The union provides a handgun and a permit to every one of the drivers. And they think this whole thing is over in a week.
ABEL: These men are fucking truck drivers. This is insane. You know who is gonna get it in the end here, me. This comes back to me.
ANDREW WALSH: It does either way.
ABEL: I'm not doing it.
ANDREW WALSH: Would you put everything at risk to stand by that. ABEL thinks this through.
ABEL: It will be the end of everything I have worked for. If one of these guys shoots somebody it's me they will bring down for it.I'll talk to him. And we need to close this deal. We can't stay like this any longer. We must close on that property. We are so weak right They are now standing on top of one of the trucks tanks as a worker pours the additive into the tank. The container says "GREEN DYE #7" on it. ABEL looks down as it flows in. He stands up and looks out across the fence at the container Why do you want this so badly?
ANDREW WALSH: Why do you want this so badly?
ABEL: Because I have my entire savings at risk with this deposit. It is That's not what I mean. Why did you want it so badly in the first place? It was a risk. always. ABEL thinks this through.
ANDREW WALSH: That's not what I mean. Why did you want it so badly in the first place? It was a risk. always. ABEL thinks this through.
ABEL: I don't know.
ANDREW WALSH: You don't know? Have you ever thought about it?
ABEL: I've thought about it every day for the last five years. This place was sitting over that fence mocking..
ANDREW WALSH: I didn't mean have you ever thought about that place.
ABEL: I don't know what you mean. ABEL looks to him in a sincere way wanting him to answer but ANDREW just waits. Finally.
ANDREW WALSH: That's very simple.
ABEL: With this he gives him a deadly serious look.
ANDREW WALSH: You take these risks.
ABEL: Only when necessary.
ANDREW WALSH: We have to get going, we need them to show up.
ANNA: ARTHUR LEWIS
ARTHUR LEWIS: Anna, you look amazing as always.
ANNA: Thank you.
ARTHUR LEWIS: Gentlemen. Do you know Ian Thompson? One of our new VP's.
ANNA: They all shake hands and sit. The WAITER comes over.
WAITER: So what can I get you to drink?
ABEL: A lot. Awkward laughter.
WAITER: I'll be right back.
ARTHUR LEWIS: So how are you?
ABEL: We've been better. but we are Yes I heard about that. if you stay in business long enough it's bound to happen eventually.
ARTHUR LEWIS: Yes I heard about that. if you stay in business long enough it's bound to happen eventually.
ANNA: Well that's exactly right. And we wanted to sit down with you tonight to make sure we were being totally up-front with everything that is going on and make sure that you understand the nature of the complaints and are comfortable that it is not going to affect our business in an adverse way.
ANDREW WALSH: Did you have a chance to look over the outline that I sent over?
ARTHUR LEWIS: Yes, we did.
ANNA: Hopefully it made clear that even in a worst case situation we will pay off any and all fines and be able to move forward with very comfortable capital on hand. ABEL jumps in taking some offense.
ABEL: But you should know Arthur that this man has been digging through our industry for over two years looking for anything he can find. And as you know probably better than anyone, having worked with some of our competitors the thought that he would have singled us out is ridiculous. It reeks of everything that is wrong with this city right now. We run a fair and clean business and follow every standard industry practice and I will fight `til my last day to prove that. This silences the table for a long beat.
ABEL: That's a very good question. This property gives us many things. firstly direct access to the river. So I can bring in fuel directly from any provider in the world straight to my tanks, then it has over 10 million gallons of storage capacity, so I can buy in the summers when my price is low and sell to my customers and most importantly some of my competitors when the price is high. I won't just drive trucks anymore. I will control my fate. but the real answer to your question. Now ABEL stares right at IAN THOMPSON.
ARTHUR LEWIS: We've always been there with you and know that we will continue to INT. ABEL'S CAR - NIGHT ABEL is driving, and ANNA sits in silence looking out the passenger window. They are heading along the main backwoods road to their house.
ANNA: Well, that went about as well as could be expected.
ABEL: Yes. Arthur is a good man.
ANNA: Do you think they will close?
ABEL: Of course.
ANNA: Yes. you need to go put it out of its misery.
ABEL: I mean it. We can't just leave it EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - NIGHT ABEL gets out of the car and looks at his smashed hood. He then walks back and approaches the animal. It is laying on the side of the road. He comes right up to it and stares into its eyes. It stares back at him. ABEL walks back to the car.
ANNA: I mean it. We can't just leave it EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - NIGHT ABEL gets out of the car and looks at his smashed hood. He then walks back and approaches the animal. It is laying on the side of the road. He comes right up to it and stares into its eyes. It stares back at him. ABEL walks back to the car.
ANNA: Is it dead?
ABEL: Well you need.
ANNA: Well you need.
ABEL: I know. He reaches down to open the trunk.
ANNA: What are you doing?
ABEL: Getting the tire iron! This whole situation has stressed them out and they are on ABEL goes to the trunk and gets out the large wrench. He walks back over to the deer. He bends down next to it and stares into its eye again. ABEL is thinking back on something, or many things. He makes a small starting movement like he is going to hit it over the head but he stops himself. He can't quite do it. Then he sits with the animal a beat longer. We come in very close to ABEL and see his hand is struggling to deliver the blow. Just as he grips the tire iron waiting. BANG! BANG! Two very loud GUNSHOTS go off from right over his shoulder. He ducks for cover then slowly turns behind him. ANNA stands there holding a small-yet-powerful Saturday Night Special- style handgun. Smoke is still rising from the end of the pistol. The deer is dead. He looks at her dumbfounded. where did she get this gun? She gives him a look. Then turns and walks back to the car. He stays and struggles to get the deer out of the road.
ANNA: Hello Maria, sorry we are a bit late. They were fine?
NANNY MARIA: Oh yes. All is good.
ANNA: Great, thank you. We'll see you in the morning then.
NANNY MARIA: NANNY MARIA comes around the corner and passes ABEL who is just standing in the living room. He only gives her a nod. ANNA is standing on the other side of the room just waiting in silence as well. NANNY MARIA goes over to the closet and gets her coat out and puts it on. The tension is building like a kettle. Finally NANNY MARIA gets herself together and walks out and as the door shuts they come immediately at each
ANNA: Yes. what?
ABEL: Yes. what?
ANNA: Yes. what?
ABEL: Are you kidding?
ANNA: Okay then. what is this gun?
ABEL: Okay then. what is this gun?
ANNA: I told you I wasn't going to just continue to stand around and let these people come and get me and my children. So unlike you who seems to be totally comfortable just standing around like some. fucking pussy. I did something about it. ABEL is slightly stammering at this point, not quite sure what to do. They are still standing on opposite sides of the room from each other. He just waits. finally.
ABEL: Where did you get it?
ANNA: You know where I got it.
ABEL: Do you have a permit?
ANNA: Not yet. This sets him off. He comes walking across the room at her as if he might hit her. He gets closer and closer.
ABEL: You must be a bigger fucking idiot than I even thought. You are trying to protect your children? Protect them? Do you have any idea what happens if you get caught using that thing? He is now standing right over her.
ANNA: You've given me? You? Are you delusional? Do you even understand how ridiculous that makes you They are really going at it now. He tries to grab her purse, which she still has over her shoulder. They struggle for it.
ABEL: Where is this thing? Let me see it.
ANNA: Let me see it. Is this going to make you safe? With that he uses brute force, probably hurting her arm, but she doesn't let on. He takes the purse from her. He opens it and takes out the small gun.
ABEL: Let me see it. Is this going to make you safe? With that he uses brute force, probably hurting her arm, but she doesn't let on. He takes the purse from her. He opens it and takes out the small gun.
ANNA: You need to protect us.
ABEL: That is what I'm doing. He walks out the front door.
GROUP: Happy Birthday! Just as ELIZABETH blows out the candles the doorbell rings. NANNY MARIA heads to the front door. The camera stays with the party. NANNY MARIA comes back into the room and standing behind her, we see a POLICE OFFICER holding some kind of ABEL walks over quickly trying not to create a scene. He leads the POLICE OFFICER back over to the front door. The PARENTS certainly notice and start stirring.
ABEL: I understand. But as you can see this is a terrible time for us. I am having my daughter's birthday ABEL is trying to remain calm and not lose his temper.
POLICE OFFICER: I understand and I apologize, I do. But this is a warrant and we need to gain complete access to the They stare at each other just as ANNA comes to the door. She sees the scene in her driveway.
ANNA: What is this?
POLICE OFFICER: Let me go check something.
ANNA: Are they serious? ABEL is seething and can only manage a slight nod. As they look across the driveway they see the OFFICER talking to someone. The officer shifts out of the way and they see he is talking to ASSISTANT D.A. LAWRENCE.
ABEL: I'm going to kill this guy.
ANNA: ANNA is trying to get his attention quietly.
ABEL: He turns and they look at each other. She signals towards the library and they share a knowing, concerned glance.
ANNA: Mr. Lawrence is it?
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: Anna Morales. She reaches out her hand to shake his with a smile.
ANNA: Anna Morales. She reaches out her hand to shake his with a smile.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: ( thinks, then ) They walk away from the others down the driveway a stretch.
ANNA: I understand you and your men have a job to do here. But we are in the middle of a seven-year-old's birthday party.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I understand, and I'm sorry. But we are coming in. She turns a little on him.
ANNA: That's not a problem, as we have nothing to hide from you. It's just that, we recently moved to this area, and there are twenty guests in our house. please. can you give me five minutes so we can ask everyone to leave calmly before you come into my home? He thinks this through.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: You can get them out of the house.
ANNA: Thank you.
ANNA: Where are you going?
ABEL: Bring the last few out.
ANNA: You've got three minutes.
ABEL: What's going on out there.
ANNA: Our guests are leaving. ABEL tries to speak but can only shake his head. Finally he jumps over the edge and she starts handing boxes down to him. He then stops again.
ABEL: Do we even need to be doing this? What exactly are we hiding here? She thinks this through.
ANNA: I don't want them going through all this before I've had a chance to.
ABEL: Is that the last one. Get back out ABEL looks around for a place to stash them.
ANNA: Thank you for coming. Here you go. Bye, Rebecca. Thanks. I'm sorry. When the last one goes she looks up at the ASST. DA to give him the all-clear. But as she does she gives him a look that could kill. The police file into the house in front of her.
ANNA: This is probably one that you are going to regret. LAWRENCE looks at her trying to figure her out.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: Excuse me?
ANNA: My husband is a very honorable man. Coming on a Saturday? It's very A.D.A. LAWRENCE This is standard.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: This is standard.
ANNA: Really? I know you think you are just doing your job. But we are not what you think we are. And you have embarrassed him in front of his family and friends. She gives him a long, almost scary look.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I think I know your father.
ANNA: Good for you. My husband is not my father. Not even close. So if I were you I would start treating us with a little more respect or he'll make it our only mission to ruin you. This was very disrespectful. and you are not going to find a fucking thing. With that she walks back towards the house as the POLICE start filing out.
ABEL: Hey, how are you?
ABEL: You'll do great. Remember. When you get them there. Hold the eye contact longer than you would like. but you watch what happens. He gives him a big smile and a pat on the back and sends him on his way.
ABEL: It is good to see you back here. You look good.
JULIAN: Thank you. JULIAN is very quiet and timid. He is missing a spark.
ABEL: Are you ready to get back to work?
JULIAN: I think so.
ABEL: You are.
JULIAN: Thank you.
ABEL: Where are you heading?
JULIAN: Bulk delivery to Chase.
ABEL: Manhattan. That's a cakewalk. JULIAN does not agree. ABEL can no longer ignore his young protege's concern.
JULIAN: I feel very vulnerable. ABEL jumps on this.
ABEL: Good. Because you are. We all are. Someone came to my house a couple nights ago to rob me. A large truck rumbles by and they wait for silence to return.
MRS. ROSE: Of course, come in.
MRS. ROSE: Oh good, it's my husband.
MRS. ROSE: Here he is. The SALES KID stands up to shake his hand.
HUSBAND: SALES STUDENT ALEX I was just showing your wife the results of my inspection. Should we head upstairs to run through some Sure. I just had one question about our exhaust chimney. Would you be willing to take a look.
HUSBAND: Sure. I just had one question about our exhaust chimney. Would you be willing to take a look.
HUSBAND: It's just outside on the other side of this wall here.
MRS. ROSE: I'm going to head up. Can I get you something to drink? Coffee. tea?
HUSBAND: I/E. DOORWAY OZONE PARK BASEMENT - DAY As the SALES KID goes through the door a massive fist of SOMEONE who has been waiting on the other side of the door comes swinging into frame and pounds the side of our KID'S head. Knocking him out instantly.
JULIAN: Cathy! They are coming again. Over. Help. Help. On Bridge. He then fumbles the CB and it drops to the floor of the cab. He looks up into the mirrors again and sees that they are still coming for him. The camera now comes in tight on his face and he pauses for a long second, and he then makes his decision. He reaches under his seat and takes out a handgun. He doesn't really seem to know what he is doing with it. But he opens the door of the truck and gets out. He aims the gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO walking towards him. LOUIS SERVIDIO sees him and is very surprised and stops.
LOUIS SERVIDIO: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy He glances over at THUG #2.
JULIAN: Get the fuck away from me!
LOUIS SERVIDIO: Okay, man. People in the cars behind the truck are starting to honk. Then LOUIS SERVIDIO gives a nod signal to THUG #2 who is on the other side of the truck, and JULIAN'S gun fires by mistake. It totally misses THUG #2. He jumps out of the way and is hiding behind the wheel.
THUG #2: Over here.
LOUIS SERVIDIO: Where is he?
THUG #2: Over here. JULIAN is just trying to decide what to do next. The sirens are now getting much closer.
LOUIS SERVIDIO: Get the car! THUG #2 takes off. This now leaves JULIAN and LOUIS SERVIDIO all alone with the police coming. As JULIAN is hiding, trying to figure out what to do next, LOUIS SERVIDIO goes running by him. As he does:
LOUIS SERVIDIO: Oh, there he is. Had to be the hero Fuck you.
JULIAN: Fuck you.
LOUIS SERVIDIO: Couldn't just let us take the Fuck you! JULIAN is screaming in a fit of panic at this point.
JULIAN: Fuck you! JULIAN is screaming in a fit of panic at this point.
LOUIS SERVIDIO: Hey man relax. calm down. Did they see you come in here? JULIAN can't stop breathing very heavy at this point.
JULIAN: I don't think so.
LOUIS SERVIDIO: Did they or not? He thinks.
JULIAN: LOUIS SERVIDIO
LOUIS SERVIDIO: Alright, there's a door down here about four more flights. Don't go out there, that's the street. Go down about two more flights after that and you'll come out below the bridge. They won't be there.
JULIAN: Fuck you!
LOUIS SERVIDIO: You're welcome. Then LOUIS SERVIDIO's head disappears and we can hear his feet flying down the steps again. JULIAN thinks for a beat, then he starts off down the stairs again as well. The camera stays right where it was as JULIAN heads down out of sight. We just hear the sounds of his feet getting lower and lower.
PETER FORENTE: It's a pretty cool machine, isn't ABEL nods.
ABEL: This causes PETER to look up and see the serious look on ABEL's face. He hits one last shot and walks a little closer to ABEL. The machine is still hitting balls behind PETER.
PETER FORENTE: I need to speak with you.
ABEL: I need to speak with you.
PETER FORENTE: I see that. PETER walks over to the machine and unplugs it. He points over towards the chairs courtside. He and ABEL sit down.
ABEL: This has gotten out of control. There was a guy with a gun at my ABEL lets this sit for a minute, and he is intently reading PETER's face. He hopes not, but he is judging to see if PETER had anything to do with all these attacks. PETER just looks back at him with a very strong poker face.
PETER FORENTE: Is everyone okay?
ABEL: Yes. I managed to chase him off.
PETER FORENTE: Well, I'm sorry, that must have been scary. what can I do.
ABEL: I need to know who is doing this.
PETER FORENTE: It's one thing to come after my trucks and drivers. and to steal from me. but this. it's Have you ever dealt with anything like this?
ABEL: It's one thing to come after my trucks and drivers. and to steal from me. but this. it's Have you ever dealt with anything like this?
PETER FORENTE: Have you ever dealt with anything like this?
ABEL: Have you ever dealt with anything like this?
PETER FORENTE: Have you met my father? They both smile. His father is an old-school gangster.
ABEL: I refuse to live my life that way. I won't do it. I am going to ask for a meeting. They both look out and think it through a bit.
PETER FORENTE: Anyone with more than 20k of storage. Can I count on you being PETER looks away for a long beat.
ABEL: Anyone with more than 20k of storage. Can I count on you being PETER looks away for a long beat.
PETER FORENTE: Yes. When are you closing on the Hold that. it's not done yet. you may be hearing from me. ( Trailed by an awkward laugh. )
ABEL: PETER FORENTE
PETER FORENTE: Hold that. it's not done yet. you may be hearing from me. ( Trailed by an awkward laugh. )
ABEL: Hold that. it's not done yet. you may be hearing from me. ( Trailed by an awkward laugh. )
PETER FORENTE: Well, good luck. ABEL stands up ready to go.
ABEL: Thank you for seeing me. I want more than this.
PETER FORENTE: I know you do. My father is in jail. as you know. And I have always wanted to conduct myself differently than he did.
ABEL: And you have.
PETER FORENTE: Almost exclusively, yes. But I know why he did what he did. Because at the time it's easier.
ABEL: But it's not.
PETER FORENTE: Yes it is. You are a good man. I will see what I can find out. This isn't good for any of us.
ABEL: Thank you.
ABEL: Joanne it's me. What are you talking about. what shots? The camera now comes around to the outside of the car looking back at ABEL through the windshield. The mansion is looming in the background. We see ABEL'S face react as he hears the news of the incident on the bridge. The camera pulls back as ABEL'S face goes totally cold.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I heard.
ABEL: I need to make sure you know that we had nothing to do with this. It's not the way I do business. In fact I have been warning my men against doing this sort of thing. It is terrible for me.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: It's not good. for either of us.
ABEL: A.D.A. LAWRENCE In my job we use whatever leverage we can gain, as I'm sure you do in your business. It's an ongoing investigation, and it will be just one piece of many. So while I appreciate you coming here. I have nothing I can tell you. LAWRENCE looks around the room thinking while ABEL says nothing, just waiting.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: In my job we use whatever leverage we can gain, as I'm sure you do in your business. It's an ongoing investigation, and it will be just one piece of many. So while I appreciate you coming here. I have nothing I can tell you. LAWRENCE looks around the room thinking while ABEL says nothing, just waiting.
ABEL: No. but I'll find him.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: You should. And when you do, bring him to us. A situation like this, happening in such a dangerous and public way, within an industry I'm charged with cleaning up. It's very bad for me. professionally They look at each other one last time. ABEL gets the message.
ARTHUR LEWIS: ARTHUR LEWIS
ABEL: ARTHUR LEWIS
ARTHUR LEWIS: I wanted to come and talk to you in person. We aren't going to be able to show up for you on Monday. We can't do the loan.
ABEL: ARTHUR LEWIS
ARTHUR LEWIS: I wanted to let you know as soon as possible so that you could try to put something else together.
ABEL: Thank you for coming. This is not I know.
ARTHUR LEWIS: I know.
ABEL: What can I do?
ARTHUR LEWIS: Nothing. The loan review committee met this afternoon and won't meet again for two weeks.
ABEL: And you are aware of the position this is putting me in?
ARTHUR LEWIS: I am.
ABEL: I paid off my first loan to you eleven years ago.
ARTHUR LEWIS: I know.
ABEL: Do you remember the term on that I don't.
ARTHUR LEWIS: I don't.
ABEL: I had seven years to pay you back. They both nod knowing what's coming next.
ARTHUR LEWIS: Seven months?
ABEL: Six and a half.
ARTHUR LEWIS: I'm sorry.
ABEL: I put 40 percent down as a deposit on this. It's all we had.
ARTHUR LEWIS: You now have three separate serious pending legal cases against you. One with sixteen counts of misconduct ranging from fraud to tax evasion. And then in the middle of our meeting today I get a report saying you had armed your entire fleet of drivers which led to a shoot-out on the 59th Street None of it is true.
ABEL: None of it is true.
ARTHUR LEWIS: That may be.
ABEL: They look at each other.
ARTHUR LEWIS: It doesn't matter.
ABEL: It does matter, that you know we didn't do this.
ARTHUR LEWIS: I do. I do. But it doesn't matter, I can't do anything. I'm ABEL's demeanor shifts.
ABEL: I'll find it.
ARTHUR LEWIS: I know you will. The banker gets into his car and backs out. The gate opens and he drives out. Just as it is about to close it starts opening again. SALES STUDENT ALEX drives in with his car trashed. He pulls up and gets out of the car looking at ABEL. He knows what has happened and is crushed. Neither of them say a word, finally ABEL gives the kid a cautious but meaningful hug around the shoulder and leads him inside.
ANNA: It's horrible.
ABEL: Where is he?
ANNA: Where is he?
ABEL: We're looking for him.
ANNA: And they haven't gotten the other Of course not.
ABEL: Of course not.
ANNA: Are you okay?
ABEL: No. I'm not. They're out. This gets her attention.
ANNA: The bank. With that ABEL walks out of the room and heads up the stairs to his bedroom. When he's halfway up the stairs she stops So what does that mean?
ABEL: The bank. With that ABEL walks out of the room and heads up the stairs to his bedroom. When he's halfway up the stairs she stops So what does that mean?
ANNA: So what does that mean?
ABEL: It means we need to find the money somewhere else.
ANNA: We have two days!
ABEL: I'll figure it out.
DAUGHTERS: You move.
ANNA: You move.
DAUGHTERS: You move.
ANNA: Stop. I've told you guys not to push it this morning, this is not the morning to be doing this. but since the second you all woke up. It's this, it's that. Just stop. The world does not revolve around This shuts them up for a beat. ABEL is seething. But then ELIZABETH ( middle ) nudges ANNIE ( oldest ) so she gives CATHERINE ( youngest ) a good hit. ANNA sees it and freaks.
ABEL: You are thirteen years old. What are you doing? Your mother asks you an hour ago to help her get out of the house smoothly and you are acting like an.
ANNIE: Oh fuck you!
ABEL: What? What? What are you talking ABEL is looking around for someone to help him and witness this. He then switches, he has had enough and gets right up in her face.
ANNIE: The world revolves around me? Me! What about her? And what about you? You're both so totally obsessed with your stupid business. You walk around like you are saving the world but what are you doing. This stings. He now changes his tone to a quiet low roar. But he can't keep quiet and by the end of the line he is yelling First off I don't walk around like I am saving anything. I chose this business because I looked at the world and said `What's the last bill people stop paying every month when they are low on cash?' `Cause that's a business I want to be in. `Cause failure wasn't much of an option for me. I lived in reality. not whatever this world is you are living in. And we help people stay warm. which isn't all that bad. ( now he is yelling again ) Maybe you've got grander ambitions but for now this is how you eat, sleep, and get all dressed up. So you better shape the fuck up and NEVER speak to me like this again!
ABEL: First off I don't walk around like I am saving anything. I chose this business because I looked at the world and said `What's the last bill people stop paying every month when they are low on cash?' `Cause that's a business I want to be in. `Cause failure wasn't much of an option for me. I lived in reality. not whatever this world is you are living in. And we help people stay warm. which isn't all that bad. ( now he is yelling again ) Maybe you've got grander ambitions but for now this is how you eat, sleep, and get all dressed up. So you better shape the fuck up and NEVER speak to me like this again!
ANNA: They both look over and ANNA is standing there. A calmness suddenly falls down on all of them.
ABEL: She looks up with a small but sweet smile.
ANNA: How's it coming?
ABEL: How's it coming?
ANNA: I've made it to 1975.
ABEL: That was a good year. ANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally support that claim.
ANNA: I'm not sure yet. but it's not as bad as they are saying it is. Turns out I kinda knew what I was They give each other a slight smile.
ABEL: I got us a three more days. and one piece. from Saul. But we're still about a million short. They look at each other with concern.
ANNA: You're going to see your little First thing.
ABEL: First thing.
ANNA: And Peter?
ABEL: As they look at each other ABEL
ANNA: This is all worth it. He pauses just long enough to think.
ABEL: Of course. A sense of caring and resolve comes over them. At least now they know what needs to be done.
ANNA: I'll be up.
ABEL: I love you.
ANNA: I love you too. ABEL turns to go upstairs as ANNA starts in again with the INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE OF JULIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY ANDREW stands in the hallway about to knock, but he waits for a beat. He knocks. The door opens to a young woman, presumably JULIAN'S wife,
ANDREW WALSH: Is Julian here?
LUISA: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: Abel would like to speak with him. To help him.
LUISA: I will tell him. JULIAN steps into the frame from behind her.
JULIAN: He's turning me in? ANDREW looks at him without much remorse.
ANDREW WALSH: Of course we are turning you in. You have put everything that man has worked for for the last 20 years at risk. If it was up to me we would be dealing with this in a very different way.
JULIAN: But I know things. This causes ANDREW to turn quickly back to him with as sharp a look as he has.
ANDREW WALSH: ANDREW WALSH
JULIAN: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: And what things do you know? JULIAN looks back at him.
JULIAN: I'm sorry.
ANDREW WALSH: I am too. ANDREW now changes his tone.
JULIAN: I don't know.
ANDREW WALSH: Where's the gun? JULIAN stutters for a moment, then.
JULIAN: I threw it in the river.
ANDREW WALSH: Good. Your background check with us says you have never been arrested, is that true?
JULIAN: Why is this putting everything at Have you ever been arrested?
ANDREW WALSH: Have you ever been arrested?
JULIAN: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: Because no bank will touch us right now. So we can't close on the new property. And he's going to lose everything on his deposit. This sits heavily on JULIAN. ANDREW hands him a card.
JULIAN: I'm sorry.
ABEL: I know.
JULIAN: I was scared.
ABEL: I know.
JULIAN: Aren't you scared?
ABEL: What do you do? ABEL thinks this through long and hard.
JULIAN: What do you do? ABEL thinks this through long and hard.
ABEL: I have always been much more scared of failure than anything else.
JULIAN: It wasn't always like this.
ABEL: It wasn't always like this.
JULIAN: Are you ruined?
ABEL: Not today. but by the end of the week. maybe.
JULIAN: I'm sorry.
ABEL: No. I am not strong.
JULIAN: No. I am not strong.
ABEL: That does not have to be true.
JULIAN: Trust me. I am not. I'm sorry. With that JULIAN walks across the parking lot towards the POLICE to turn himself in. ANDREW walks up behind ABEL and stands there looking.
ANDREW WALSH: I'm late. I will meet you at four.
ABEL: I'm gonna try to get us a little more time. The three COPS are standing waiting as JULIAN walks towards them. ABEL turns around, facing the camera, and closes his eyes in sadness. With ABEL in the foreground we see JULIAN make it halfway to the COPS, then he stops.
COP 1: ABEL'S face tells us he knows what is coming. JULIAN sets off running. Before the COPS can get close to him he is off. ABEL turns and sees what is happening. He does not follow chase. His head just drops.
ABEL: Thank you for seeing me.
JOSEPH: Of course.
ABEL: I need more time.
JOSEPH: Of course you do.
ABEL: I know our agreement doesn't allow for that. But. I need more time.
JOSEPH: This takes ABEL back a bit.
ABEL: Thank you for asking. Many, many It's a difficult time to do Yes. it is.
JOSEPH: It's a difficult time to do Yes. it is.
ABEL: Yes. it is.
JOSEPH: I'll give you three more days. Then it's over.
ABEL: Thank you.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: So. I should start by thanking you for your assistance in. in attempting to bring in your driver?
ANDREW WALSH: We didn't think he'd react that A.D.A. LAWRENCE Yes. Well, the officers there didn't set it up very well on their end either.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: Yes. Well, the officers there didn't set it up very well on their end either.
ANDREW WALSH: I'm sorry.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: We are looking for him.
ANDREW WALSH: So are we. it's very sad. He was very close to Abel.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I understand. Well. Ms. Lange.
DEPUTY LANGE: It has been brought to our attention that it might be beneficial on your end to resolve this issue in a time sensitive way.
ANDREW WALSH: DEPUTY LANGE
DEPUTY LANGE: So we have prepared an offer for you to review. They slide the offer across the table. ANDREW opens it and gives it a once over.
ANDREW WALSH: I'll show this to them. He'll never go for it, but it's a start.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: This could get a lot worse for you I know. I will present it to him. ANDREW gets up and prepares to leave. LAWRENCE stands with him and walks him out into the hallway.
ANDREW WALSH: I know. I will present it to him. ANDREW gets up and prepares to leave. LAWRENCE stands with him and walks him out into the hallway.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: And Andrew, one other thing. He turns. They are now alone in the hallway.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I need this to stop.
ANDREW WALSH: You need what to stop?
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: This fucking bullshit with the open warfare. I won't put up with it. It's starting to be a real problem.
ANDREW WALSH: Starting to be? No shit.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: Not for you. but for me. This lingers for a beat as the meaning sinks in.
ANDREW WALSH: I understand. The kid went out and got his own gun. This was not us. No matter what you think of him, Abel doesn't work this way.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I really could give a fuck, but you need to get your man to talk to these people, give in, stop doing whatever you are doing to bring this shit on you. It needs to stop.
ANDREW WALSH: He wants to talk to them. We've been trying to set up a meeting. O'Leary hasn't been able to get it A.D.A. LAWRENCE I'll talk to him. ANDREW gives him a look.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I'll talk to him. ANDREW gives him a look.
ABEL: I talked to the Hasid, I got us three days. ANDREW nods.
ANDREW WALSH: Is that enough?
ABEL: I don't know.
ANDREW WALSH: Well here it is. It's just a first He hands him the plea deal from the DA. ABEL looks it over but shows almost no emotion. Then.
ABEL: Felons can't vote. This takes ANDREW back.
ANDREW WALSH: I'm sorry?
ABEL: This plea has me.
ANDREW WALSH: I know. It's just a first offer.
ABEL: I would never take this.
ANDREW WALSH: I know. ABEL looks off and resets.
ABEL: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: Lawrence, he's tight with O'Leary.
ABEL: Of course he is.
ANDREW WALSH: Does Julian have anything? ABEL gives him a look?
ABEL: All the drivers could have us on scales. Why?
ANDREW WALSH: If we are cutting deals, we can't have anything new come up at the last minute.
ABEL: He would never do that.
ANDREW WALSH: We need to find him. Lawrence needs him.
ABEL: Thank you for letting me in.
LUISA: Of course. ABEL moves his chair closer. It's meant to be, and is a bit Have you seen Julian?
ABEL: Have you seen Julian?
LUISA: ABEL questions her with a look.
ABEL: We need to find him.
LUISA: I know.
ABEL: I am worried about him.
LUISA: So am I.
ABEL: You know we were going to support him. I do not know why he ran.
LUISA: He was scared. ABEL shakes his head.
ABEL: I know.
LUISA: He has always wanted to make you proud. You know that right?
ABEL: Yes. Well this time that hasn't worked out.
LUISA: No. How did you do it?
ABEL: Do what?
LUISA: She motions towards his suit.
ABEL: I know. It makes me very sad, because he is a very talented young man. But there are some decisions that you cannot come back from. I need to know where he is. And I need him to turn himself in. His actions are hurting me and my business. And I refuse to let other people's weaknesses hurt me. I don't know how it has come to this, but it has. If he does the right thing I will help to take care of his responsibilities. You and your family. When you see him. Tell him this. Please.
LUISA: I will. ABEL gets up and starts looking around the apartment a bit. He walks over to a small cabinet.
ABEL: Does he have any money?
LUISA: I'm sorry?
ABEL: Money? Has he taken money out of your bank account?
LUISA: I don't know?
ABEL: You need to start looking into these things. It is very important that we find him safely. And with that JULIAN comes smashing out of the tiny cabinet where he was hiding and knocks over ABEL. JULIAN runs to the front door with ABEL chasing him. He starts flying down the stairs at top panic speed. ABEL follows him down half the flight and realizes it is useless.
ABEL: ( in Spanish again ) I understand why you lied, but it is not smart.
ANDREW WALSH: Fuck You! You better run!
ABEL: Thank you both for agreeing to meet with me.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ: Of course.
ABEL: I think we have met before but I didn't realize you were Saul's I am.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ: I am.
ABEL: I'm sorry to ask but how old are I'm 23.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ: I'm 23.
ABEL: LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ: My Grandfather didn't trust any of his children to run the business.
ABEL: LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ: I know that you tried to buy the company from my Grandfather several His goal was to stay healthy long enough to be able to give the company to me. Which he thankfully They both give a slight smile.
ABEL: LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ: His goal was to stay healthy long enough to be able to give the company to me. Which he thankfully They both give a slight smile.
ABEL: I understand. And I hope that your Grandfather was able to communicate to you how much I have always respected him. And it was only out of respect for the business he had built, and because I knew of his reservations and feelings about your uncles and your father that I made those offers.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ: I understand.
ABEL: But, I am not here to offer to buy your company.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ: As I'm sure you will soon learn some years are good. others not so. I am in contract with a significant hard deposit at risk to purchase the old Bayfront terminal.
ABEL: As I'm sure you will soon learn some years are good. others not so. I am in contract with a significant hard deposit at risk to purchase the old Bayfront terminal.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ: I see.
ABEL: And due to circumstances beyond my control my bank has left me at the I'm sorry.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ: I'm sorry.
ABEL: So, I am here, hat in hand, looking for a loan. I certainly expect the terms to be in your favor as I could not be at a weaker place. But, if your Grandfather trusted you with his company, I would be willing to trust you as my lien They all stare at each other. Then the old man shifts in his How much?
SAUL LEFKOWITZ: How much?
ABEL: I need $500,000. SAUL and his GRANDDAUGHTER look at each other. They say nothing but clearly know each other well.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ: Would you give us a minute.
ABEL: Of course.
LEFKOWITZ RECEPTIONIST: You can go back in.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ: We can offer you the 500k at 20 percent for a year.
ABEL: Okay. Thank you. They shake hands and then he hugs the old man good bye.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ: So, I guess we will see you Tonight? Oh yes, of course.
ABEL: Tonight? Oh yes, of course.
BILL O'LEARY: Abel. Please sit. Finally everyone settles and the room falls quiet.
ABEL: ABEL is deadly serious. He just lets this sit and looks around the room at each person. They all seem to be waiting for him to continue. But he doesn't. He just lets this sit. Finally PETER FORENTE, who is across from ABEL, shifts in his seat and leans forward.
PETER FORENTE: Um. Abel. we had a chance to meet for a little bit before you got here and. of course everyone in this room is fully capable of lying to their own mothers on their deathbeds, but. the conclusion we have come to. I should say we are fairly convinced after a very frank conversation. that these guys who are doing this. that they don't actually work for anyone in this room. As you know there are many other smaller providers in the area that might be responsible who are not here tonight. This sits in the room for a long beat. Everyone then shifts back their attention to ABEL waiting for his response. Peter. thank you. That may be He stops and thinks about how to continue.
ABEL: Peter. thank you. That may be He stops and thinks about how to continue.
ABEL: She looks up with a small but sweet smile.
ANNA: How's it coming?
ABEL: How's it coming?
ANNA: I've made it to 1975.
ABEL: That was a good year. ANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally support that claim.
ANNA: I'm not sure yet. but it's not as bad as they are saying it is. I guess I knew what I was doing. They give each other a slight smile.
ABEL: I got us a three more days. and one piece. from Saul. But we're still about a million short. Concern and exhaustion creep onto Abel's face.
ANNA: You're going to see your little First thing.
ABEL: First thing.
ANNA: And Peter?
ABEL: Abel is now sitting down on the chair.
ANNA: They're fine. ANNA gets up from her desk and comes over to him.
ABEL: Of course.
ANNA: Look at us.it is.
ABEL: I know. A sense of caring and resolve comes over them. At least now they know what needs to be done.
ANNA: I'll be up.
ABEL: I love you.
ANNA: I love you too. ABEL turns to go upstairs as ANNA starts in again with the INT. ABEL'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY ABEL is driving towards the office and is listening to the idle chatter on the radio between the dispatcher and the drivers who are out. They are underneath the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in stop and go traffic. Suddenly a panic stricken VOICE blasts through on the radio.
LOUIS SERVIDIO: Please. Please. They stare at each other.
ABEL: Your friend is dead. who do you work for.
LOUIS SERVIDIO: You know I could never tell you Stop. just stop.
ABEL: Stop. just stop.
LOUIS SERVIDIO: This was it anyway. Okay. Okay. ABEL looks right through him and then finally lowers the gun and releases his hands from around his jacket and he gets up and looks back at ABEL.
ARNOLD KLINE: Jimmy, can you give me a minute? Jimmy looks around then walks into the back.
ABEL: Jimmy, can you give me a minute? Jimmy looks around then walks into the back.
ARNOLD KLINE: Abel, that was well said.
ABEL: Thank you.
ARNOLD KLINE: What can I do for you?
ABEL: I've just come to collect that check you owe me. This takes him back a step.
ARNOLD KLINE: What check is that?
ABEL: The one for $213,000.
ARNOLD KLINE: I'm sorry?
ABEL: That's how much has been taken from me over the last six months.
ARNOLD KLINE: I had nothing to do with that.
ABEL: Your Far Rockaway facility bought a load of fuel last week off one of my stolen trucks.
ARNOLD KLINE: That's not possible.
ABEL: I was standing on top of one of my hi-jacked trucks a couple weeks ago thinking about the cowards who did this when I remembered I had bought the load of fuel off a friend's tanker straight from Texas. As I'm sure you know Texas #4 is marked. But that was just one load, so every truck that has left my lot for the last two weeks has been marked with dye that I've put in. And luckily four more of my trucks got jacked since.. My guess is there are at least 4600 gallons of marked fuel in your small tank right now. No answer. Finally.
ARNOLD KLINE: How much?
ABEL: I said.213,000.
ARNOLD KLINE: I'll need a day.
ABEL: ABEL gets ready to leave.
ARNOLD KLINE: I've just been buying this stuff off these guys, it was only a couple loads, I don't know who they are. I would never do that.
ABEL: My goal was to have you out of business by the end of next year. And if you're this fucking desperate it doesn't seem like it will even take that long. He walks away.
ARNOLD KLINE: Abel, I wasn't the only person buying this shit. He turns.
ABEL: I don't care.
ARNOLD KLINE: It may ruin me.
ABEL: When you find out who else it was you can get them to pay you back the difference. Kinda makes you miss having your father around? But I need the whole lot tomorrow or the feds will be at your doorstep by noon. He leaves.
ABEL: You look good out there.
ELIAS: I didn't know you were coming.
ABEL: I didn't either. I didn't mean to take you away.
ELIAS: We're done. He sits down next to him. They both look out for a long, long Thanks for coming.
ABEL: Of course. You've grown.
ELIAS: You saw me a month ago.
ABEL: I know. but you have. ABEL looks across as a small group of GIRLS FIELD HOCKEY PLAYERS walk across the field in front of them. They watch them pass and walk away.
ELIAS: I don't know how you get anything done around here.
ABEL: I don't know how you get anything done around here.
ELIAS: I don't. Slight smile at each other.
ABEL: I'm in a bit of a rough patch.
ELIAS: It happens.
ABEL: It happens.
ELIAS: I know.
ABEL: ABEL stands and looks around for a good bit. Then thinks about sitting down again.
ELIAS: What will?
ABEL: Not having had one. Then he sits.
ELIAS: What is it?
ABEL: I need to take out a short term mortgage on our apartment building.
ELIAS: That thing isn't worth more than 150 grand though?
ABEL: Since when do you need to be taking out sucker mortgages for 200 grand?
ELIAS: Since when do you need to be taking out sucker mortgages for 200 grand?
ABEL: I'm up against it a bit. It will be They look at each other for a long beat. And then he signs Thank you. It's good to see your I love you.
ELIAS: I love you.
ABEL: I love you too. They hug and then ELIAS walks off. ABEL sits back down and just watches him walk away.
PETER FORENTE: Well here he is. The caped Come over. Are you alright?
ABEL: PETER FORENTE
PETER FORENTE: Come over. Are you alright?
ABEL: I am.
PETER FORENTE: Did they catch any of them? Sit.
ABEL: The one guy didn't make it out of the crash, and the other guy That was very well said last night.
PETER FORENTE: That was very well said last night.
ABEL: Thank you. And thanks for seeing Of course. So what is it?
PETER FORENTE: Of course. So what is it?
ABEL: I need a loan.
PETER FORENTE: You don't want to do that.
ABEL: No shit. but I'm here.
PETER FORENTE: What are we talking about here.
ABEL: Six hundred thousand.
PETER FORENTE: Jesus. Abel, that's a problem.
ABEL: Yes. but if I don't get it.
PETER FORENTE: What's my collateral?
ABEL: The terminal.
PETER FORENTE: Yeah me and how many other people will be coming after it. No way.
ABEL: You'll get your money.
PETER FORENTE: Abel, you know I respect everything you've done. Because of it we haven't come down on you the way I should have for coming into my service area and poaching my customers. You're good at what you do, probably better than us, and I accept that. But this would be different. I don't want you to be in this position. We are not nice people to borrow three quarters of million dollars from.
ABEL: I know that.
PETER FORENTE: Let's sleep on this. Both of us.
ANNA: What a day.
ABEL: Are you okay?
ANNA: Are you okay?
ABEL: Car chases?
ANNA: Car chases?
ABEL: Who knew? She gives him a loving look.
ANNA: Who knew? She gives him a loving look.
ABEL: He seemed good. But the girls up at that place are.
ANNA: I can tell you the girls didn't look like that where I went to After a brief light moment the cloud comes back over him.
ABEL: I can tell you the girls didn't look like that where I went to After a brief light moment the cloud comes back over him.
ANNA: After a brief light moment the cloud comes back over him.
ABEL: How are we here?
ANNA: It was a lot of things all at once.
ABEL: How did it go?
ANNA: How did it go?
ABEL: We can probably pull it off. Three different parties. it'll be a mess. and the terms. Peter suddenly showed me his true colors. He lets out a brutal sigh.
ANNA: I'm sorry.
ABEL: I spent my whole life trying not to become a gangster.
ANNA: I know.
ABEL: .And now. on the biggest deal in my career they will all control He sits there for a long beat and then she comes and hands him a piece of paper with a series of numbers on it. He looks up at her.
ANNA: It's a bank account. ABEL just waits for more but gets nothing.
ABEL: How much is in it?
ANNA: How much is in it?
ABEL: How much is in it?
ANNA: A lot.
ABEL: What does that mean?
ANNA: It will help. You could replace Peter's money and get him out of the deal.
ABEL: Where did it come from?
ANNA: Where did it come from? She stops and thinks, then:
ABEL: Where did it come from? She stops and thinks, then:
ANNA: Since 1971 I have been skimming money out of the company. Some years a little. others a lot. In the beginning it was just in case times got tough but then it was because you were taking all these chances. I didn't know what else to do. I couldn't risk having us be left with nothing. This knocks him back.
ABEL: What do you expect me to do with Use it.. Abel.
ANNA: Use it.. Abel.
ABEL: Is it clean?
ANNA: What does that mean? He thinks that through.
ABEL: It means if you walked into the office of the people who have been trying to put us in jail right now and slapped a check from that account down on their desk would it push me further into hell or help to get me out?
ANNA: It's as clean as every other dollar we've ever made.
ABEL: That's a fucking bullshit answer.
ANNA: I can clear it on the books.
ABEL: Well it sounds like you should take this money and keep it right where it is. because I'm going to pretend that we never had this conversation. And you can use that when they drag me off to jail! With that he tries to get passed her and head upstairs. She follows and is standing looking up at him.
ANNA: So what's your plan here? He turns to her and squares off.
ABEL: I'll get it done. And it won't be as a cheat.
ANNA: ( Yelling, but controlled enough to not wake the kids. ) Oh you are too much. You've been walking around your whole life like this all happened because of your hard work, good luck, and charm. Mr. Fucking American Dream. Well this is America. but it's not a dream, and that wasn't good luck helping you out all those years. IT WAS ME! Doing the things you didn't want to know about.
ABEL: You stole from me! This stops her in her tracks. And eventually a little smile comes across her face. She comes way down and almost delivers this line in a whisper.
ANNA: Oh. You have always been very good about not letting your ego get in the way of business. Don't start now just because it's me. With that ABEL turns up the stairs and heads to bed.
ABEL: We'll use the money. your money. It's the smart play.
ANNA: It's our money.
ABEL: I know.
ANNA: These fucking guys.what's this additional $11,000?
ABEL: I guess there is still some fuel in two of the tanks. they gave us a fair price on it. With that they both smile, she signs it and then gives him a INT. TEMPORARY TRAILER - DAY ABEL comes back in and hands the docs to JOSEPH, the oldest Hasid, who signs them.
JOSEPH: Mazel Tov.
ANDREW WALSH: To you too. Did you know.about the money?
ABEL: To you too. Did you know.about the money?
ANNA: ANDREW looks him right in the eye.
ANDREW WALSH: You should have told me.
ABEL: You should have told me.
ANDREW WALSH: I know. I'm sorry.
ANNA: Abel.congratulations. Now cheer up. And can someone give me a tour of this place we just paid two million bucks for? ABEL, ANDREW, and ANNA walk towards the tanks looking around. They come around the corner to THE VIEW.
ANNA: What a hell-hole this city is.
ABEL: ANDREW WALSH
ANDREW WALSH: I don't know why but I guess I never realized we even had this view from back here. That line sits for a long beat.
ABEL: I did. Then they hear someone behind them. They turn. It's JULIAN. He is standing holding a gun. They stare for a long beat.
JULIAN: I didn't.
ABEL: I see that.
JULIAN: I have nowhere to go.
ABEL: Nowhere easy.
JULIAN: Fuck you. I have nothing. And somehow you've ended up with everything you wanted. ABEL looks at the gun in his hand.
ABEL: It wasn't meant to be.
JULIAN: What is that supposed to mean?
ABEL: I know what you wanted. But you need to forget that. You are looking backward. Only look forward, that is what you can I'm sorry. You gave me a very good chance. Right?
JULIAN: I'm sorry. You gave me a very good chance. Right?
ABEL: Probably a better chance than I Please take care of my family.
JULIAN: Probably a better chance than I Please take care of my family.
ABEL: Please take care of my family.
JULIAN: Please take care of my family.
ABEL: ABEL looks at him trying to read where this poor kid is at.
JULIAN: ABEL looks at him trying to read where this poor kid is at.
ABEL: I will. With that JULIAN takes the gun and puts it in his mouth and pulls the trigger. The gun goes off and the red blood sprays on the white side of the fuel tank that is behind him. ABEL and the rest are left totally in shock. They are beside themselves. But out of the corner of his eye ABEL notices that the bullet has also pierced through the tank and amid the red spray a flow of black heating oil is pouring out through the bullet hole onto the ground. ABEL steps around JULIAN'S body and goes over to the hole. He picks up an old rag from the ground and stuffs it into the hole plugging the flow of oil.
ANDREW WALSH: What. what should we do?
ABEL: We call the police.
ANDREW WALSH: With that he walks off behind the tanks.
ABEL: With that he walks off behind the tanks.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I'm very sorry. Did you know him I did.
ABEL: I did.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: He must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure.
ABEL: Yeah. For a while I thought he was. it's just.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I'm sorry. They look out across the city.
ABEL: You really do have to be lucky.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: Yes. so you are chasing down hijackers now?
ABEL: I was right there. I couldn't help myself. LAWRENCE nods approval.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: You'll find him.
ABEL: You'll find him.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: Probably not.
ABEL: Well, thank you for coming. I wanted to make sure this was handled correctly.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: Of course.
ABEL: I'm not sure how I got here.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: So. I should tell you that I won't be able to take that deal you offered. There is no way I would ever accept a felony charge for anything we've done.
ABEL: So. I should tell you that I won't be able to take that deal you offered. There is no way I would ever accept a felony charge for anything we've done.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I know.
ABEL: I am not a felon.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: That's probably true.
ABEL: But I also can't have you digging around my life and keeping this hanging around my neck for the next ten years. I love fighting a good battle but this. it's very bad for my business. This gets Lawrence's attention.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: We can probably do that.
ABEL: They both look out for a beat.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I hear you closed on this terminal It looks that way.
ABEL: It looks that way.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I didn't realize that you had that in the works.
ABEL: For a very long time.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: That will put you in quite a powerful position.
ABEL: Within my business it has that LAWRENCE shifts his tone ever so slightly.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: If you get this place up and running again it will have significant influence. politically speaking. ABEL picks up on the word POLITICALLY and stares down
ABEL: LAWRENCE gives a slight smile and then pauses.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: And sometimes we need help to get there. You've come a very long Yes, I have.
ABEL: Yes, I have.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: In a very short time.
ABEL: It doesn't feel that way. But please know that I have always chosen the path that was the most A.D.A. LAWRENCE The most right?
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: The most right?
ABEL: A.D.A. LAWRENCE That one makes my head hurt a The result is never in question for me. Just what path do I take to get there. And I have never questioned my path. There is always one that is most right. And that is what this is.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: That one makes my head hurt a The result is never in question for me. Just what path do I take to get there. And I have never questioned my path. There is always one that is most right. And that is what this is.
ABEL: The result is never in question for me. Just what path do I take to get there. And I have never questioned my path. There is always one that is most right. And that is what this is.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE: I hope so. They look at each other and then out over the city.
