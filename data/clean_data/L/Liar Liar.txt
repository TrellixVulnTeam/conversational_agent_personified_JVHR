BEGGAR: Will you?
FLETCHER: How come?
BEGGAR: How come?
FLETCHER: Because I resent your p re sen ce. You fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt. Further, I don't believe you'll use the money for food, but I believe you'll use it for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap. As Fletcher heads up the stairs.

JUDGE STEVENS: ( DRYLY ) Well, you're still young. It'll happen more and more. In the meantime, what do you say we get. down to business? First, Mr. Reid, I see that your client was previously represented by Mr. Rand of your office.
FLETCHER: Yes, Your Honor.
JUDGE STEVENS: I take it you're seeking to substitute in as counsel?
FLETCHER: Yes, Your Honor.
JUDGE STEVENS: Fine , fine. And for the record, the reason is?
FLETCHER: Mr. Rand had severe ethical objections to my client's
JUDGE STEVENS: I take it you don't share the same ethical objections, Mr. I have lower standards, Your I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole wants the substitution of counsel, I'll allow it. Is that what you want, Mrs. Cole?

JUDGE STEVENS: Motion for a continuance denied. Is there any chance of a settlement in this case?
DANA: I don't think so, Your Honor. Mr. Reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to
FLETCHER: ( DESPERATE ) SETTLE! SETTLE! SETTLE!
JUDGE STEVENS: There appears to have been a change in strategy. Let's go to my chambers and negotiate.
DANA: Your Honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if Mrs. Cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. We have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband.
JUDGE STEVENS: Sounds pretty damning, Mr. It certainly does.
FLETCHER: It certainly does.
DANA: However, my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute. Against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars.
JUDGE STEVENS: Two four seems like a pretty fair offer, Mr. Reid.
FLETCHER: Fantastically fair. Phenominally fair. In fact, I'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid. Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness What are you suggesting, Mr. Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position?

DANA: Can the sarcasm, Reid. All right, I admit it I've seen you make even the lamest case fly. But this time I have you. Even Clarence Darrow couldn't explain this away.
JUDGE SAMIOAN: Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a dynamite explanation, I'd say you're dead in the water. How's you client's story?
FLETCHER: The best that money can buy, Y o u r Honor. ·
JUDGE STEVENS: Strong corroborating evidence?
FLETCHER: We have evidence that you are not going to-believe.
JUDGE STEVENS: You're pretty confident how this trial is going to come out, eh, Mr. Reid?
FLETCHER: ( hopeless ) . "Confident" is too weak a word, Your Honor. I am certain what will happen if I take this puppy to trial. The verdict will be a stunning, humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees.
DANA: All right! Double the offer! Four point eight! And not a penny more.
FLETCHER ): She storms out, leaving an astounded Fletcher behind.
JUDGE STEVENS: You are some negotiator, Mr. Reid. If your client has half a brain, she'll jump at the
