SLACK: I'm alright, I'M ALRIGHT! Slack uses her left arm to push herself up to a sitting position. Her right arm is BLEEDING, up near the shoulder.
RILEY: Seen you around.
SLACK: Seen you around.
Y: A POLICEMAN steps over.
I: A POLICEMAN steps over.
POLICEMAN: The hell happened here?
RILEY: Somebody shot the little fat man.
POLICEMAN: Yeah, I see that. You're under INT. BOARD ROOM - FIDDLER'S GREEN - DAY A UNIFORMED GUARD leaves CHOLO in a PRISTINE WHITE conference room with glass walls overlooking the rotting CITY far below. Cholo sets the case of champagne and the box of Cohibas on a conference table. A SMAN stands in SILHOUETTE at the windows.
ILHOUETTED MAN: How was Uniontown?
CHOLO: SILHOUETTED MAN
SILHOUETTED MAN: Death intrudes on us even in the Green, I'm afraid. I heard about what happened with my neighbors.
CHOLO: brought you back some presents.
CHOLO: I got something else, too. Cholo tears open the box of Cohibas. He picks up two cigars, bites off the tips, puts one in his mouth, then, walking back to the Silhouetted Man, puts the other in his mouth, lighting them both with a wooden match that he strikes on his jeans.
F: SILHOUETTED MAN
SILHOUETTED MAN: Thank you.
CHOLO: No, thank you! Twenty grand. That's what I got comin' for last night. I never bothered to pick it up.
S: ILHOUETTED MAN
ILHOUETTED MAN: You didn't?
CHOLO: Nope. I left it in the bank. Your bank. With all my other dough. enough now to buy me a place.
SILHOUETTED MAN: You mean here? In the Green? The Silhouetted Man steps away from the window. Expensively dressed, in his early 60s, he is PAUL KAUFMAN. He sets down the highball glass Cholo gave him, gets out a proper champagne flute, and fills it from the bottle, smiling politely at Cholo.
KAUFMAN: I'm sorry, Mister DeMora, but there's a very long waiting list.
CHOLO: How long?
KAUFMAN: This is an extremely desirable location. Space is limited.
CHOLO: You mean restricted.
KAUFMAN: Well, I do have a board of directors, a membership committee that has to approve. A wave of incomparable sadness sweeps over Cholo's face.
C: I guess it takes more than money to become a "member".
HOLO: I guess it takes more than money to become a "member".
Y: Take my advice. Withdraw your funds from the bank and spend them somewhere else.
K: Take my advice. Withdraw your funds from the bank and spend them somewhere else.
KAUFMAN: Take my advice. Withdraw your funds from the bank and spend them somewhere else.
CHOLO: ( Quietly ) Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me.
AUFMAN: I'm sorry, but.
CHOLO: No, no, no. Three years! Three years I been cleaning up after you, taking out your garbage, and you tell me I'm not good enough? You're the one who's no good. You are no fucking good. And you are gonna let me in. You know why? Because I know what goes on around here. How many of your fucking "members" know what's in that garbage I take out for you? Cholo lunges at Kaufman, grabs him by the collar.
KAUFMAN: Maybe we should talk about this when you're less excited. Kaufman presses a button under the table. THREE SECURITY GUARDS rush in, GRAB Cholo, and drag him away. Kaufman stops one of the guards at the door.
I: INT/EXT. JAIL - AFTERNOON 43 43 RILEY RIPS off part of his shirt-sleeve and starts to bandage the wound on SLACK'S arm. They are in a jail cell that has brick walls and a small barred window facing a dark alley. CHARLIE, stripped of all his guns, stares outside longingly.
RILEY: ( To Slack ) Why you? In that arena. Why did the little fat man throw you in with those things?
SLACK: It wasn't the little man. It was the big man. The man upstairs. He's got his fingers in everything down here. If you can drink it, shoot it up, fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs to him. He's just seein' that we get a few cheap kicks so we don't go thinkin' too hard about why he's eating steak and the rest of us are lucky to get the bones.
RILEY: Same question. Why you?
SLACK: They found out I was working with Mulligan and his people. Tired of eatin' off Cbones.
HARLIE: What can you do? Every place is the Places with people. I'm gonna find me a place where there ain't no people. North. Canada.
RILEY: Places with people. I'm gonna find me a place where there ain't no people. North. Canada.
SLACK: Wherever you're going, take me
CHARLIE: He won't. Riley likes to be alone. He might take me. Cuzz havin' me around is pretty much the same as bein' alone. ( Glancing at Riley )
C: I can shoot. And I can be pretty fucking useful. I had training. I was gonna join the Army. Up the Green. Till somebody figured I'd be a better hooker than a soldier.
S: I can shoot. And I can be pretty fucking useful. I had training. I was gonna join the Army. Up the Green. Till somebody figured I'd be a better hooker than a soldier.
SLACK: I can shoot. And I can be pretty fucking useful. I had training. I was gonna join the Army. Up the Green. Till somebody figured I'd be a better hooker than a soldier.
RILEY: I don't need to hear your story. Everybody's got a story, and I'm tired of hearin' them all!
SLACK: What's your story, Riley? They look at each other, clearly attracted.
R: I said everybody has a story. That was wrong. I don't have one. Daddy was a preacher. Mama kept the house. School. Engineering. Nothing bad ever happened to me.( turning away ).till everything changed.
ILEY: I said everybody has a story. That was wrong. I don't have one. Daddy was a preacher. Mama kept the house. School. Engineering. Nothing bad ever happened to me.( turning away ).till everything changed.
LACK: Everything changed for all of us. Whether we had a story or not.
CHARLIE: Riley and Slack look out the window. FOUR SECURITY MEN are chasing MULLIGAN into the alley outside. They drive him like an animal against a wall, club him, and drag him away.
RILEY: RILEY instinctively reaches through the window's bars, but there's nothing he can do. It's a helpless feeling.
HARLIE: What are they gonna do? Kill him?
SLACK: Not right away. First, they'll try to get what they can out of him. About people like me. Riley puts his hand on her back.
CHOLO: We're taking the truck out. Get
FOXY: No, not him. Just the regular
CHOLO: No, not him. Just the regular
B: ( Handing Gus a five ) You win. You got him in the brain.
ARRETT: ( Handing Gus a five ) You win. You got him in the brain.
DEPOT GUARD: What's up, Cholo?
CHOLO: ( Flashing an official-looking paper ) Takin' the truck out.
DEPOT GUARD: You just got back in this morning.
CHOLO: Nobody gets a day off these days.
DEPOT GUARD: ( Taking Cholo's paper ) Hey, wait a minute this is from yesterday.
CHOLO: ( Keeping his cool ) Oh, I must have given you the wrong one. Here. Cholo reaches down, but not into his pocket. For his gun. Just before he draws it.SHOTS ring out.
DEPOT GUARD: Relax. Just target practise.
GUS: Double or nothing?
BARRETT: GUS aims his rifle at the jerking head of TONY BALONEY. As he is about to fire, there's a SOUND at his back.
GUS: Quit scratching around back there. You're tryin' ta fuck up my aim.
BARRETT: I'm just standin' here. I'm not doin' nothing. The SOUND comes again. From the woods that adjoin the lot. Barrett grabs the handles of a KLIEG LIGHT mounted on a pivot and swings it so that it ILLUMINATES the tree-line.
T: here's nothing there. Nothing but BRANCHES being slapped by erratic gusts of wind. Barrett pivots the Klieg light back to its original position, jumping out of his skin when the bright white beam reveals. A DEAD THING within arm's length.
CHOLO: What's that? Screaming practice?
CHOLO: ( Stopping them ) Ain't our fight. Stenches are making it easy for us.
C: Let's grab the truck. HOLO and his team sprint across the lot to DEAD RECKONING.
FOXY: Should we send up some `sky flowers'?
CHOLO: No. Those things want to get in here.let `em in.
K: SOLDIERS abandon their stations and scatter, shooting wildly. NUMBER NINE knocks one of them cold with its baseball bat. The soldier falls, losing his M-16. BIG DADDY grabs the bat and throws it aside. Picking up the soldier's M-16, he presses the weapon into Number Nine's hands, even arranging Number Nine's fingers on the trigger. RATATATAT. With the gun aimed at the ground, Number Nine fires a BURST that sends her into a spastic dance. The soldier sits back up. Draws a pistol. Big Daddy grabs the barrel of the still-firing M-16 and guides it along the pavement to. .the soldier's legs. Bullets march up his groin, belly, chest, and, finally, head. He drops. ANOTHER SOLDIER attacks. This time, Number Nine aims her
KNIPP: Phone call, sir.
KAUFMAN: Thank you, Knipp. I'll take it. Knipp brings a radio-phone to the table. Kaufman picks up the receiver and lifts it to his ear.
KAUFMAN: CHOLO ( O.S. )
KAUFMAN: Ah. The one that got away.
S: CHOLO ( O.S. )
KAUFMAN: What do you want, Mister DeMora?
CHOLO: I can't have a place in the Green, fine. I'll go find another place. But you know what I'm gonna need? Money. I want my money out of your bank. And I want the rest of the money out of your bank. And if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna blow you out of your fuckin' ivory tower. I've got Dead Reckoning.
KAUFMAN: That's unfortunate.
UTHERLAND: In a world where the dead are returning to life, the word `trouble' loses much of its meaning. ( Beat ) He wants money.
KAUFMAN: In a world where the dead are returning to life, the word `trouble' loses much of its meaning. ( Beat ) He wants money.
SUTHERLAND: Pay him.
KAUFMAN: We don't negotiate with terrorists. There are other options.
K: INT. JAIL - NIGHT 55 55 CLANG! A FIDDLER'S GREEN SECURITY GUARD opens a cell door.
S: ECURITY GUARD
ECURITY GUARD: Which one of you is Denbo? RILEY, CHARLIE, and SLACK exchange glances. What now?
KAUFMAN: Mister Denbo. Come in. Can I offer you a drink?
RILEY: I don't drink.
KAUFMAN: Well, then.please sit down.
RILEY: Nobody else is sitting. I think I'll just stand here, like the rest of you. While you tell me why I'm standing here.
AUFMAN: We need you to repossess a vehicle that belongs to us. The vehicle you designed, Mister Denbo. Dead Reckoning has been stolen. By your second in command. I want him captured. Or killed. And I want my two-million-dollar piece of equipment returned.
R: The truck.
ILEY: The truck.
KAUFMAN: Which has guns. Big guns. That could do a great deal of damage if he were to aim them at this city.
RILEY: Why don't you just send out your I don't want to lose them. I could send five hundred men against that thing and they'd all come back in body bags. It's your vehicle. Cholo was your man. You might be able to get close enough to.do what has to be done. ( Refilling his scotch ) Do this for me and I'll grant you something in return. Residence in the Green.
C: I don't want to lose them. I could send five hundred men against that thing and they'd all come back in body bags. It's your vehicle. Cholo was your man.

You might be able to get close enough to.do what has to be done. ( Refilling his scotch ) Do this for me and I'll grant you something in return. Residence in the Green.
RILEY: Not me. That's what Cholo wanted, and you didn't give it to him, did you? That's why he's out there waving a cannon at your ass. Kaufman won't admit that Riley's right, but he looks at him with a glimmer of respect.
KAUFMAN: But.there's nothing up north.
RILEY: That's the idea.
KAUFMAN: Alright. You've named your price. An easy one to pay.
R: One more thing. My friends. They go with me.
ILEY: One more thing. My friends. They go with me.
KAUFMAN: Take them. e looks at Riley, a hint of desperation behind his eyes.
RILEY: How quickly?
KAUFMAN: By midnight.
RILEY: I have a way.
CHOLO: ( Tense ) Knock it off!
CHARLIE: I like the iron I already got.
SOLDIER: This piece fires fourteen rounds a second. Charlie unstraps his own REMINGTON. A la Sergeant York, he licks his thumb. Wets the sight. And BLASTS a COCKROACH climbing on a wall twenty feet away.
C: I don't norm'ly need fourteen rounds.
HARLIE: I don't norm'ly need fourteen rounds.
M: I'll take that gun.
K: I'll take that gun.
C: I'll take that gun.
T: I'll take that gun.
SLACK: I'll take that gun.
SOLDIER: Can you handle it?
SLACK: Better'n you. The safety's off. he Soldier checks the gun. The safety is off. He clicks it on and embarrassedly hands the weapon to Slack.
RILEY: ( To Slack and Charlie ) You guys don't have to come out with me if you don't want to. Slack ties her hair back with a bandana. Checks her gun clip.
SLACK: I'd feel like a dick if I didn't.
HARLIE: Me too. Just look at me you can tell I'd feel like a dick.
SLACK: Some shit, ain't it? Goin' out to save a place we don't give a fuck
RILEY: It's not the place. It's the people in it.
MANOLETE: That's how I am called.Manolete. After the bullfighter.
P: TEAHOUSE steps forward. A mean-looking Asian right out of Mortal Kombat. He joins his hands, as if in prayer, and bows.
KAUFMAN: TEAHOUSE steps forward. A mean-looking Asian right out of Mortal Kombat. He joins his hands, as if in prayer, and bows.
P: ILLSBURY is a woman, a Sumo-sized Samoan, six hundred pounds and seven feet tall, swaggering, decked out in a clatter of fighting gear.
PILLSBURY: I come here to do sumthin'. Not stann aroun'. Why we stann aroun'? Less go do sumthin'.
MOUSE: ( Looking around nervously ) Don't leave me alone here long.
CHOLO: At midnight. Give me a call. Let Mouse nods, running off to hide in a BOAT SHED.
C: Geez. Cholo made a mess.
HARLIE: Geez. Cholo made a mess.
RILEY: Cholo didn't do all this. Clouds of thick black SMOKE from the fires BILLOW across the depot, restricting visibility. Ever-shifting OPENINGS in the clouds reveal glimpses of torn BODY PARTS.
MANOLETE: When the truck pulled out, it must have knocked the fence down. That's how they got in.
RILEY: That fencing was pushed in from You know how many stenches it would take to do that?
TEAHOUSE: You know how many stenches it would take to do that?
RILEY: There's a thousand of them out there for every one of us.
CHARLIE: Good thing we're smarter.
SLACK: Look who's talkin'.
RILEY: They're getting smart. I saw it in
TEAHOUSE: What do they want? Slack looks back as she walks. The zombies have taken down another section of the depot fence, beyond which lies a suburb. Beyond which is the river. Beyond which is the glow of the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE.
SLACK: They want the city.
RILEY: The city is us. They're after us. We pissed `em off one too many times.
M: They'll never get across the river.
O: They'll never get across the river.
S: They'll never get across the river.
T: They'll never get across the river.
MANOLETE: They'll never get across the river.
CHARLIE: Thank Heaven.
RILEY: Gotta love the guy. He still believes in Heaven. Anyone got a radio? Teahouse pulls a Motorola from his belt. Just as he tosses it to Riley, they hear.GROWLING! he team draws their weapons, standing in a loose circle, their backs to each other, guns searching for a target. Darting eyes peer into the void. MORE NOISES emanate from somewhere. Everywhere. Slowly. .Charlie unstraps his Remington. Licks his thumb. Wets the sight of the rifle.
LACK: ( A whisper ) Why do you do that?
CHARLIE: ( Whispering back ) Catches the light. Right now it's moonlight. Lets me see where I'm aimin'. BLAM! Charlie FIRES! A single shot into the black smoke.
SLACK: The hell you shooting at?
CHARLIE: That thing.
A: DEAD MAN steps out of the smoke! Before anyone can react, it grabs Slack's shoulder from behind! She whirls around. Pulls away. Is about to shoot when she sees AN ENTRY WOUND on the left side of the Thing's forehead.
ANOLETE: ( Hysterical ) There's more of `em out there. I can hear `em. THERE'S MORE! There are SHUFFLING SOUNDS in the smoke. Manolete backs away. Pillsbury grabs him. Slaps him, hard, across the face.
M: If they is more, we gonna need wid us, like de man you ain't. Riley lifts Teahouse's Motorola and pushes "Send".
R: If they is more, we gonna need wid us, like de man you ain't. Riley lifts Teahouse's Motorola and pushes "Send".
PILLSBURY: If they is more, we gonna need wid us, like de man you ain't. Riley lifts Teahouse's Motorola and pushes "Send".
RILEY: Riley Denbo. Calling the Green.
SUTHERLAND: A TROOPER, equally alarmed, is reporting.
TROOPER: Wiped out! That's what he said! Denbo! He said the depot was wiped out by stenches!
KAUFMAN: Thank you. Keep us informed.
CHARLIE: Gotta go get the keys, Riley. iley looks across the lot to the CHARRED RUIN of a shack. Tire fires BURN around it. Debris smolders.
RILEY: Ain't no keys to get. Melted.
ANOLETE: Screw keys. Hot wire the fucker. MANOLETE climbs in and goes to work under the dash.
PILLSBURY: e feelin' better since I hit `im.
H: e feelin' better since I hit `im.
C: .A DEAD OLD MAN BEHIND HER DROPS, a HOLE in its head.
T: .A DEAD OLD MAN BEHIND HER DROPS, a HOLE in its head.
S: .A DEAD OLD MAN BEHIND HER DROPS, a HOLE in its head.
LACK: Thanks, Charlie. That was useful. The WIND shifts and black SMOKE envelopes them.
MANOLETE: I can't see! Riley pulls out a flashlight and shines it under the dash. he team fans out around the T-Bird. The smoke is so thick they can't make out anything. Including each other. harlie peers into openings that shift on the breeze. What he doesn't see, what he can't see, is what's behind him. ..a FEMALE WALKER, wearing the soiled and tattered remnants of a bridal gown. The fabric seems to glow in the smoke. The bride shuffles toward CHARLIE. We see it coming. No one else does. Just as it opens its mouth to bite. BLAM! Slack SHOOTS! Her bullet cuts closer than the one Charlie fired, CLIPPING OFF THE TOP OF HIS EAR before
SLACK: Not! That hurt! I didn't hurt you! Manolete fumbles with colored wires under the dash.
CHARLIE: Not! That hurt! I didn't hurt you! Manolete fumbles with colored wires under the dash.
RILEY: Hurry up.
PILLSBURY: ( Impatient ) Yellow to red!
TEAHOUSE: What the fuck does a Samoan know about hot-wiring cars?
PILLSBURY: Five thousand cars. Stole. Every year in Samoa.
MANOLETE: Fifty thousand in Mexico.
R: Mexico got a million cars. Samoa got five thousand. Every one. Stolen.
PILLSBURY: Mexico got a million cars. Samoa got five thousand. Every one. Stolen.
MANOLETE: I GOT IT! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! Riley leads the team into the T-Bird. Manolete starts to get out from under the dash. As TEAHOUSE settles into a seat by the door. .SOMETHING heavy and wet SMACKS his shoulder. It's a FOREARM! It drops onto Teahouse as if thrown at him.
TEAHOUSE: God! Oh, GOD, WHAT'S THIS?! Teahouse HURLS the bloody thing onto the asphalt. Shockingly, the ARM SPRINGS BACK, THUMPING against Teahouse's face! A twist of torn muscle, no thicker than clothesline, is keeping the limb loosely attached to. .A DEAD THING that has crawled beside the T-Bird. Lifting itself, it BITES a large filet out of Teahouse's arm. CHARLIE
M: SHOOTS it. to the metal he pulls out of the depot. Slack glances at Teahouse, then, wind in her hair, leans in close to Riley.
SLACK: ( Softly ) How long does he have?
RILEY: I had a brother. Real brother, by birth. Bit. Hung on for six days. Before he turned. I was the one had to shoot him.
SLACK: And you said nothin' bad ever happened to you.
RILEY: That happened to my brother.
SLACK: ( Into his eyes ) But you kept going.
ILEY: Got to, right?
C: up. Dead is dead. And that ain't you. And that ain't me.
B: up. Dead is dead. And that ain't you. And that ain't me.
K: up. Dead is dead. And that ain't you. And that ain't me.
K: up. Dead is dead. And that ain't you. And that ain't me.
S: up. Dead is dead. And that ain't you. And that ain't me.
S: up. Dead is dead. And that ain't you. And that ain't me.
Y: up. Dead is dead. And that ain't you. And that ain't me.
SLACK: up. Dead is dead. And that ain't you. And that ain't me.
AUFMAN: I recognize that some of you are concerned. We've been threatened by a disgruntled employee. I've sent people out to take care of the problem. However, should something go wrong, I want to assure you that measures have been taken. I've established outposts. With food and supplies to support us on our way.
C: On our way? To where?
LIFF: On our way? To where?
KAUFMAN: Alternate sites have been chosen. Air transport has been arranged. For us and our families. As well as necessary support personnel.
CLIFF: What about all the others? Kaufman looks at Cliff, as if expecting him to understand.
AUFMAN: All the others can be replaced.
LIFF: Cliff, let me talk to you for a Kaufman leads Cliff into.
KAUFMAN: Cliff, let me talk to you for a Kaufman leads Cliff into.
CLIFF: Nervous ) No.
KAUFMAN: No, and I don't want to replace you. You have promise. A day may come when you earn yourself some responsibilities. Right now, the responsibilities are mine. All the responsibilities. It was my
CLIFF: Yes, but.
KAUFMAN: No buts.
CLIFF: Kaufman looks disappointed. Taking Cliff by the arm, smiling again, he leads him over to an outer door and opens it. An armed SECURITY GUARD stands in the corridor outside.
KAUFMAN: Take him out with the rest of the garbage. I won't be needing this man anymore.
W: At the conference table, Sutherland sees the light coming in from the outer corridor, better defining the silhouettes as the Security Guard drags Cliff away.
F: At the conference table, Sutherland sees the light coming in from the outer corridor, better defining the silhouettes as the Security Guard drags Cliff away.
O: At the conference table, Sutherland sees the light coming in from the outer corridor, better defining the silhouettes as the Security Guard drags Cliff away.
S: ( To Styles ) Pretty soon it's going to be one of us.
UTHERLAND: ( To Styles ) Pretty soon it's going to be one of us.
CHOLO: If I don't have this truck, I'm no different to Kaufman than that poor Mexican bastard out there.
OXY: He's never gonna pay.
CHOLO: He knows it's his ass if he doesn't. Cholo slides open a small window, grabs his crossbow, and SHOOTS the Gardener in the head.
S: EXT. MCKEE'S ROCKS - NIGHT 69 69 CLOSE ON: a small, electronic unit, the size and appearance of a "Game Boy". AN LED SCREEN shows a BLINKING RED DOT moving along a MAP.

ILEY: How long since you been out here?
SLACK: Never been out. Lived in the city since.it was a regular city.
ILEY: Pull over.
SLACK: ( Surprised ) Huh?
RILEY: You said you were going to make yourself useful. Right now what I could use is for you to pull over. he does. The T-Bird stops along a road bordered by a MARSH thick with tall CAT TAILS. Unexpectedly, Riley stands and points his automatic at PILLSBURY and MANOLETE.
RILEY: I made a deal with your boss. Find Cholo. I'm gonna do it. Keep him from blowing up the Green. I'm gonna do it, I don't want people to get hurt. Bring back Dead Reckoning. Sorry. That's where I stop. I didn't ask him for much, just guns, ammo, and a car. I've got the guns. I've got the ammo. And if I find Dead Reckoning I'm gonna have the best fucking car that's ever been built, and I'm taking it to Canada. If any of you don't like that idea. Riley reaches down and opens the passenger door. Manolete looks out and sees the CAT TAILS MOVING. THREE WALKERS are slogging through the marsh.
C: Some choice.
R: Some choice.
R: Some choice.
MANOLETE: Some choice.
PILLSBURY: ood choice. I like see Canada.
G: ood choice. I like see Canada.
ILEY: Charlie, keep these two covered. Charlie pulls his .45. Riley turns around his seat, glancing down again at the "Game Boy" in his palm. The RED DOT has moved on to ANOTHER MAP.
SLACK: This is what you were thinking about all along. You got me out here figuring I'm a boy scout, and now you're telling me we're just
ILEY: You have a problem with that?
SLACK: No. I like the way you think.
HARLIE: I like the way he thinks, too. Just look at me you can tell I like the way he thinks.
RILEY: Take another right.
SLACK: How do you know which way you're Riley holds up the "Game Boy". It BEEPS SOFTLY as the RED DOT shifts onto another MAP.
RILEY: I built a homing device into Dead Reckoning. If Cholo's anywhere within fifty miles, we can track him.
CHOLO: Mouse. Anything?
MOUSE: Not yet. No boat. No money. No INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT I'm telling you, he's never gonna That's why we're here.
PRETTY BOY: I'm telling you, he's never gonna That's why we're here.
CHOLO: That's why we're here.
RILEY: Shit. He's going to Ross Park.
SLACK: What's there?
RILEY: Powder magazine. Where they keep the big boomers. Rockets. For Dead Reckoning's cannons.
KNIPP: Any word from Mister Denbo, sir?
KAUFMAN: No. Pack us up. We might have to be leaving.
KNIPP: In the helicopters?
KAUFMAN: We'll only need one of them.
FOXY: Looks like no one's here. The gates stand wide open. There's no sign of life. CHOLO punches a button. The SIDE HATCH HISSES OPEN.
CHOLO: Foxy. You're elected. Get out there and see what the fuck.
SCAR: I'll go.
SUTHERLAND: How much is Kaufman paying you and your men?
GREASY MAN: Four hundred a day. Each.
STYLES: I'll pay you five thousand a day. EXT. T-BIRD - NIGHT The car speeds down the road with SLACK at the wheel.
SCAR: This place is important. The men here wouldn't just walk out.
FOXY: Maybe they had no choice. FOXY and SCAR move toward a large STORAGE BUILDING where a door swings in the night breeze, SLAPPING alarmingly against the wall. Beyond the opening is a BLACK MAW, like a velvet curtain, past which nothing can be seen.
SCAR: Brubaker! You okay? Where's the other guys? What happened here?
CHOLO: That's good. That's all we need.
FOXY: ( Sober ) To blow up the Green.
RILEY: Cholo's moving out. Looks like he's heading right for us.
T: Riley looks outside. Beyond the homes he can see THE CITY.
S: Riley looks outside. Beyond the homes he can see THE CITY.
RILEY: ( To the Others ) Y'all stay here.
SLACK: You're goin' out there alone? You need our guns.
RILEY: Dead Reckoning's got steel skin an inch thick. You can't shoot your way in. I'm hopin' I can talk my way in.
MANOLETE: He's gonna steal the truck and leave us here.
CHARLIE: Riley'd never do that. Just look at him, you can tell he'd never do that.
RILEY: Keep an eye on the hatches. If I get in, I'll try to leave one open. Riley takes off. Charlie looks torn. He wants to go with Riley, but he has to keep PILLSBURY and Manolete covered.
PILLSBURY: I like dat man. You go help `im. I take care of dis sissy. Pillsbury, moving fast for a big woman, POUNDS Manolete's temple with a mighty fist. He drops like a lead weight.
GREASY MAN: I don't know about this. I mean.
SUTHERLAND: Kaufman was gonna leave people behind. So we're leaving him.
CHARLIE: Everything's cool back there. Riley is about to object, when DEAD RECKONING comes rumbling around a corner a hundred yards down the street. Riley checks his watch again. 11:52.
RILEY: Put on your Sunday smile. Try to look friendly.
CHARLIE: I am friendly. Just look at me you can tell I'm friendly.
CHOLO: Denbo. And his idiot. ( Beat ) Stop. Gimme the mike.
RILEY: Grabbed the T-Bird.
CHOLO: What are you doin' up here?
RILEY: Tracking you. With this. Riley holds up his "Game Boy". Cholo looks surprised.
CHOLO: You were always a smart guy, Riley. Much smarter'n me.
RILEY: You went and took off without inviting us along.
CHOLO: You weren't around to get invited. Anyway, I figured you wouldn't want in on this.
RILEY: We want in on anything you got goin'.
CHOLO: ( To Pretty Boy ) Open up.
FOXY: What're you, nuts?
CHOLO: Open up!
CHOLO: The hell you so happy about?
CHARLIE: Riley told me to smile. So's you'd let us come in.
CHOLO: I'd rather have you in here than out there. KA-CHUNK! Cholo lifts his crossbow, pressing a loaded arrow up under Riley's chin. BLOOD TRICKLES.
RILEY: EXT. HILLSIDE HOME DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 94 94 SLACK and PILLSBURY creep forward, freezing as they see RILEY with the crossbow at his neck. Slack aims her K-90 at CHOLO, RUSTLING branches as she moves.
SLACK: That man pulls the trigger, he's INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT CHOLO cocks his head outside.
CHOLO: Who else is out there?
RILEY: Kaufman sent some guys with us. We took care of `em. I know you
CHOLO: Yup. Pretty Boy, set the cannons.
SLACK: We're running out of time here. C'mon, Riley. Make yourself useful. MANOLETE begins to stir on the ground beside THE T-BIRD.
RILEY: Don't do it, Cholo.
CHOLO: Kaufman's got it coming.
RILEY: Hit the tower square, you'll kill a lot of innocent people. Miss and hit the city, you'll kill a lot of our friends. Your beef's with Kaufman, not them. The turret on the roof GROANS as the cannons rotate.
CHOLO: He's killed a lot of our friends. Every week we took out the garbage, you and me. Every month I took out
CHOLO: When the smoke clears, I'm gonna
RILEY: There won't be any fancy shit left. And money burns.
CHOLO: Not when you keep it in a safe.
CHOLO: WHAT THE FUCK? CHOLO'S eyes fall to the "Game Boy" in Riley's hand.
CHOLO: You did something, didn't you? With your FUCKING TOY!
CHOLO: Fix it!
RILEY: Not a chance. Riley tosses the "Game Boy" out the open hatch. Cholo reaches out after it.
RILEY: Easy boys. Riley looks at the clock on the control panel. 12:01. Charlie follows his gaze.
CHARLIE: Geez. We just made it. Riley CLICKS the transmitter on.
RILEY: Riley Denbo calling the Green.
KAUFMAN: ( Into radio, urgent ) Yes?
KAUFMAN: ( Sagging with relief ) I owe you, Mister Denbo.
RILEY: I'm glad you feel that way. Because I'm taking your fucking truck.
KNIPP: ( Frightened ) Mister Kaufman, sir. I dunno what's happening, sir, but it sounds bad.
SUTHERLAND: All this time Kaufman's been worried about a revolution on the streets. He never thought it would
KNIPP: I think they just did, sir.
CHOLO: I hate you, Riley. There's something about you I've always fucking hated.
RILEY: ( Smiling ) Same here.
SLACK: Riley. Look out there.
CHOLO: I didn't have to blow the fucking place up. Somebody else did for me!
RILEY: ( Stunned ) The stenches. They got across the river. They got across the fucking river. ( To the others ) Get him inside. PILLSBURY steps in and lifts Cholo easily to his feet.
CHOLO: Wait, wait, wait. What are we doin'? Where we goin'?
RILEY: Back to the city.
CHOLO: Not this horse. You got the T-Bird?
FOXY: Me, too. FOXY jumps out of DEAD RECKONING and stands at Cholo's side. Riley, Slack, and Pillsbury climb aboard. Riley looks down at Cholo and Foxy.
RILEY: You guys'd be safer coming with us.
CHOLO: Nah, you'd never let me have any T-Bird's down that driveway over there. Guns and ammo inside.
RILEY: T-Bird's down that driveway over there. Guns and ammo inside.
CHOLO: INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 116 116 RILEY closes the hatch. Blood trickles from under his chin where Cholo stuck him with the crossbow. SLACK reaches up and pulls off the bandana that holds back her hair, which cascades down. She uses the fabric to clean the blood off Riley's neck. He looks at her, touched by the familiarity of the gesture.
SLACK: Almost lost you there.
RILEY: I don't get lost so easy. ( To PRETTY BOY ) We gotta get across the water.
PRETTY BOY: The bridges into the city are all bricked up.
SLACK: We could blast our way through.
RILEY: Don't want to. If the stenches got

HOLO: I got it. WFFFFT! Cholo picks off the Walker with his crossbow.
HOLO: Foxy, a few yards away, whirls, aiming his gun at the Walker. Cholo is faster. With no time to reload, in agony, he pulls a FISTFUL OF ARROWS from his quiver and DRIVES THEM THROUGH THE WALKER'S FACE AND SKULL. The Walker falls. So does an ominous silence.
AHHH.FUCK!: Foxy, a few yards away, whirls, aiming his gun at the Walker. Cholo is faster. With no time to reload, in agony, he pulls a FISTFUL OF ARROWS from his quiver and DRIVES THEM THROUGH THE WALKER'S FACE AND SKULL. The Walker falls. So does an ominous silence.

FOXY: I'll get outa here. You take the INT/EXT. DEAD RECKONING - RIVER ROAD - NIGHT EAD RECKONING drives upriver. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: THE CITY can be seen BURNING in the distance.
PRETTY BOY: The old J&L'll take us over. Right outside the throat.
RILEY: Gotta get it down.
PRETTY BOY: The controls are in that booth up EXT. CONTROL BOOTH - J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT RILEY'S POV: A CONTROL BOOTH is built into the superstructure of the bridge, about fifteen feet off the ground, on DEAD RECKONING'S side of the river.
RILEY: Get back in there. What are you BLAM! She shoots a WALKER that has come out of the night.
SLACK: Making myself useful.
BLAM!: Riley stops running. Looks back to see what's being shot.
SLACK: You missed.
CHARLIE: Nope. I blew its ass off. The rat is now half a rat. Its ass has been blown off. Yet
SLACK: ( Realizing ) Jesus. It's dead.
CHARLIE: They all are. SKREEEEEEEE! ZOMBIE RATS crawl up onto the roadbed. DOZENS. Riley takes off away from them. Slack and Charlie hurry closer, firing, trying to pick the critters off. The rats reach Riley! Nip at his heels. He leaps. Swings onto a girder. Climbs to the control booth. The rats don't follow. Slack heaves a sigh of relief just before. .SKREEEEEEEE! A second pack of rats scurries toward her! She vaults over a railing, dropping several feet to. .the riverbank below. But there are rats here too! Charlie fires at them from above. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FUR AND BLOOD
T: Slack crouches on top of the upturned hull. No way to steer. No paddles. The current carrying her away.
CHARLIE: INT. CONTROL BOOTH - J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT 130 130 Hearing the scream, RILEY looks out the control booth window and sees. .SLACK being taken downstream.
R: Bring her over as soon as you can! Charlie pops back into DEAD RECKONING. Riley climbs to the top of the descending roadbed and. .LEAPS across the narrowing gulf to the other side. He lands. Falls. Rolls. Gets to his feet and runs toward Slack and the city.
ILEY: Bring her over as soon as you can! Charlie pops back into DEAD RECKONING. Riley climbs to the top of the descending roadbed and. .LEAPS across the narrowing gulf to the other side. He lands. Falls. Rolls. Gets to his feet and runs toward Slack and the city.
SLACK: We can't get out! There's no way out!
BRIAN: We can't get out! There's no way out!
SLACK: There will be. Come with me.
BRIAN: Daddy! Daddy's still locked up. Slack runs off with Brian, past a MANHOLE surrounded by canvas fences, "CAUTION" signs, and flaming OIL POTS. As MAINTENANCE WORKERS scramble out of the manhole. .DEAD THINGS close in. The Workers, unarmed, pick up the ball-shaped pots and BOWL them at the Walkers. As the "balls" roll, their FIRES SWIRL, making them look like flaming comets.
S: ome of the pots CRACK OPEN, creating POOLS OF FIRE on the street. One of the "balls" remains whole until it smacks against the feet of a Walker. Then it opens. And the Walker is engulfed in flames. Big Daddy looks at the Walker with sadness. He lifts his rifle again and shoots the flaming creature in the head.
B: Big Daddy walks to the manhole. TOOLS are strewn around it, pickaxes, sledges, chainsaws, and a pneumatic hammer which is lying on the street.RATTATATTAT.still running. Big Daddy looks at the FIDDLER'S GREEN SKYSCRAPER. His goal. Finally in reach. He looks down at the pneumatic hammer, and picks it up by the handle. With the heavy tool vibrating in its hand, Big Daddy walks toward the building. He doesn't get very far before the hammer's electrical cord is pulled out of the extension it's plugged into. The hammer stops running. Big Daddy looks at it. Puzzles over its stillness for a moment. Then. .he looks at the building. At its doors, abandoned by guards. Doors that are made of glass. The barrel of an M-16 is planted against Big Daddy's temple by a MILITIAMAN.
T: hey race into the street level of the three-story ATRIUM. Chopin LILTS, caged birds SING. RESIDENTS SCREAM, running crazily in all directions. A bank of GLASS DOORS leading to the street is under assault by WALKERS, ten deep.
T: They can't get in. Downstairs. The car. The Dead Things POUND at the doors. One Guard runs away. The Other Three follow.
I: They can't get in. Downstairs. The car. The Dead Things POUND at the doors. One Guard runs away. The Other Three follow.

SECURITY GUARD: YOU STUPID OLD FUCK! He's about to fire when Knipp steps in front of Kaufman.
KNIPP: DON'T SHOOT! ( Grabbing Kaufman's gun hand ) Boss? Don't you shoot, neither. We're all on the same
S: side. Least we're supposed to be.
ECURITY GUARD: I'm on my own side now. The Guard takes off after his comrades.

NIPP: Just let us go, Mister DeMora. Let us get out of here.
CHOLO: ( Calmly reloading ) You can go, Knipp, but not him.
AUFMAN: You fucking spic bastard!
CHOLO: I think we should talk when you're a little less excited. Kaufman has a will of iron. He keeps going, gritting his teeth against the pain, reaching out for his gun, as. CRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH! More tools PENETRATE the doors. More HANDS POKE through. aufman looks at his worst nightmare.Dead Things ripping their way through the cobwebbed doors, invading his temple.
R: The commotion distracts Cholo just long enough for Kaufman to lift his gun and FIRE nine rounds. in the heart. He is slammed against the wall, his glazing eyes staring up into the atrium, the place he so desired. It's the last thing he sees before he keels over, dead. Knipp pulls Kaufman onto his feet. They look up to see. BIG DADDY leading his army into the atrium. Kaufman aims and FIRES. A BULLET HITS BIG DADDY in the upper chest, blowing DEAD FLESH out of his back. The Dead Man feels no pain, but it focuses on Kaufman and starts after him with purpose. Kaufman sees something in Big Daddy's eyes. Something that's not dead. Kaufman fires again. CLICK! He's out of ammo.

K: Boss. We gotta get outa here! Knipp pulls Kaufman to a stairway door. They rush inside. The moment they're out of sight, the Walkers forget about them, moving on into the atrium. All except Big Daddy. That rage is still in its face as he lumbers toward the stairway door.

MULLIGAN: ( To his men ) Let's go get our guns, EXT. NEAR THE "THROAT" - NIGHT ILEY runs out of a line of trees. In the distance, he sees. .the "THROAT", where much of the CITY'S POPULATION is trapped, herded by HUNDREDS OF WALKING DEAD against the layers of electrified fencing that were erected to protect them. There's no escape. People are being TORN apart and EATEN. The fencing SPARKS as bodies touch it and are ELECTROCUTED. Terrible SCREAMS fill the air.
R: Riley hears the distinctive ROAR of DEAD RECKONING'S engines, the CLATTER of its treads. He moves toward the sound as. and puts a shell through the thing's skull. Blood flies, taking on the sudden glow of a halo as it is BACKLIT by. .the glare of DEAD RECKONING'S approaching headlights. The dead thing falls to the road, where. .it is turned to apple butter by Dead Reckoning's enormous treads. Riley stands right in the vehicle's path.

HARLIE: ( Pure anguish ) RILEY! Three seconds later, Riley's figure comes scrambling across the windshield, climbing up toward.
ILEY: We gotta blow the fences!
RILEY: Yeah, but they're capped! The barrels of the two fourteen-inchers are still capped. DEAD RECKONING keeps rolling. RILEY climbs out onto one of the cannon barrels. WHAM! A WALKER grabs him by the leg from the road. Riley blasts him with his .45. As OTHER WALKERS approach, he shoots them with one hand, Rusing the other to uncap the cannon.
ILEY: Number One is clear! I'm going for Number Two!

NIPP: ( Looking at the fuel gauge ) We Kaufman moans. Knipp steers the car slowly, carefully through the shadows, pulling in beside a GASOLINE PUMP near the base of a RAMP that leads up to the street. Knipp pushes a button that pops open the gas tank. He shuts the engine off and gets out, taking the keys, which have a Mag-Card attached to them.
H: e slides the Mag-Card into a slot, activating the pump. An LED scrolls "Thank you, Mr. Kaufman". Knipp pulls the nozzle. Freezes when he hears. .FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. A DARK FIGURE is approaching through the shadows. nipp drops the nozzle. Ducks into the car. SLAMS the door. WHAM! A SINGLE HAND SMACKS against the driver-side window. A FACE leans in behind the hand. A face full of rage. BIG
AUFMAN: Shoot it! Shoot the damn thing!
L: You didn't gimme no gun, sir. Big Daddy moves to one of the rear windows. He can't see inside. The window is tinted. He returns to the clear windshield, looks back, at an angle, and sees Kaufman in the rear compartment. Big Daddy recognizes him. From upstairs. It's the man who shot him. The Dead Thing looks up. Sees the gasoline pump. His hand drops to the embroidery on its jump-suit."Texaco". He moves deliberately toward the pump.

KAUFMAN: Pull out! PULL OUT!
K: Sorry, sir. Keys are in the pump. Big Daddy sees the nozzle on the cement. Picks it up, feeling the familiarity of it. Pulls the trigger. Gasoline squirts. The rage in his face turns to a kind of satisfaction.
NIPP: Sorry, sir. Keys are in the pump. Big Daddy sees the nozzle on the cement. Picks it up, feeling the familiarity of it. Pulls the trigger. Gasoline squirts. The rage in his face turns to a kind of satisfaction.
ORD!: Big Daddy looks at the butler. Sniffs him. Then flings him aside. Knipp is not his prey. With a glance at Kaufman, cowering in the back seat, Big Daddy slams the car door and, surprisingly, walks away. Up the ramp toward the street. The nozzle remains stuck in the "fabric" of the windshield. Gasoline continues to flow into the car. Kaufman crawls into the front seat, wincing from his wounds, and KICKS the nozzle out of the window with his good leg, getting soaked with gas in the process. He opens the door. Limps to the pump. Grabs the keys. As he starts back toward the car. .WHAM! SOMETHING is standing right in front of him. It's one of the WALKING DEAD. It's.
T: aufman shakes his head in disbelief.
K: aufman shakes his head in disbelief.
K: aufman shakes his head in disbelief.
KAUFMAN: N-no, y-you're dead. ( Realization dawning ) Oh my God. You're dead!
B: RRRUMBLE-UMBLE-UMBLE! The SOUND of a bowling ball. Kaufman looks up. It's not a bowling ball. It's an OIL POT, rolled down the ramp by Big Daddy. Kaufman SCREAMS. The fire ball approaches the gas-soaked Lincoln, the gas-soaked Kaufman, and. .WHOOOMPH! Kaufman and The Cholo Thing are IMMOLATED. The FIREBALL removes everything from sight, except a few floating HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS, burning in mid-air. HROUGH LICKS OF FLAME we see.Big Daddy is almost smiling.

MULLIGAN: We could still use you, Riley. Riley looks out at the city, where there is still scattered distant gunfire. He looks at Brian, standing at Mulligan's side, his innocent face speckled with the blood of the dead. Riley shakes his head.
RILEY: It's all yours, Mulligan.
RILEY: Riley picks up a pair of binoculars and looks through the windshield at BIG DADDY.
