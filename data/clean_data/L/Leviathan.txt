JONES: ( hispanic voice ) ( female ) BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
DEJESUS: ( hispanic voice ) ( female ) BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
BOWMAN: ( female ) BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
WILLIE'S VOICE: ( woman's voice )
UNDERWATER: WILLIE'S POV The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature, atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure. She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes the tool attached to the end of her arm. The move is practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on a set of egg beaters. First, she inserts the existing tool into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she disengages the tool. Next, she selects the next tool from the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into position. Sixpack's voice comes over the radio.
SIXPACK'S VOICE: Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit or something? We're all waiting on you, honey.
WILLIE: ( under control )
WILLIE'S VOICE: Six to Shack.Hook's on. Ready to winch.
UNDERWATER MACHINERY: Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and dumpsters squatting in the gloom. A winch begins grinding and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks. It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with several others to complete a set. We hear BECK'S VOICE.
DEJESUS: When it's time to relax.. One thing stands clear.
DEJESUS' POV: Inside his helmet we see the grid of LED gauges monitoring vital signs.
DEJESUS: .beer after beer. Oh, shit.
DEJESUS: ( rising terror )
INSIDE: Beck grabs his microphone. He tries to remain calm but there is a definite tremble in his voice.
BECK: Give me a readout, DeJesus.
OUTSIDE: The other divers move quickly to DeJesus.
JONES: He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
BOWMAN: Calm!? Where's Doc?
INSIDE: Beck stands in front of the equipment monitors, lost.
BECK: ( trying to keep control )
COBB: Where's Doc?!
DEJESUS: ( panicked )
BECK'S VOICE: ( making a decision )
OUTSIDE: ON DEJESUS He is forced into the LOCK, the underwater elevator room is eerily lit. His readout continues inside his helmet.5, 4, 3.DeJesus screams.
ON BECK: DeJesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room. Beck hits the elevator switchnothing happens. He hits it again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by the SCREAMING VACUUM PUMPS of the elevator. It's moving! Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock.
BOWMAN: I'm telling you, it's the suits!
JONES: Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them. It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
SIXPACK: And just what the fuck would he have done to stop it, huh? That would have been you, DeJesus. Yeah.I was standing next to a guy who blew a suit once in the Indian Ocean.little tiny hole in the fucking toe of his suit .ocean came in and the pressure crammed his whole fucking body up into his helmet. They just buried his helmet.
DEJESUS: ( coldly )
SIXPACK: Yeah, I bet you do. I bet you were imploding in your pants. Jonesy! Doc!.Help me! Help me!
BECK: Knock it off, Sixpack! I know it's been a long month for every- one, but we can't let something like this tear us apart.
BECK: He turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at college graduation with his Eastern establishment looking father. Leadership "how-to" books like The One Minute Manager, etc. line his bookshelf with technical manuals on underwater mining. He opens his door to leave when SUDDENLY A LOUD METALLIC GROANING NOISE stops him cold. The entire Shack seems shifting, like a giant waking from a nap.
MESS: The NOISE stops the fight between DeJesus and Sixpack cold. All eyes go to the ceiling and walls.
JONES: Fuck the suits man.this place is going to kill us first.
DEJESUS: ( listening ) ( sitting down again )
BOWMAN: What's the weather like up top?
WILLIE: Clear for pickup.
JONES: Let's hope it holds.
COBB: Then what? Huh? Then what? You folks think going up top's the answer to all your problems. Well, it ain't.
BOWMAN: Give us a break, Cobb.
COBB: A break? You folks don't need a break, you need psychiatrists. 'Know what you'd be doing if you were up there, right now?
SIXPACK: ( a boorish leer )
COBB: Eating pussy my ass. What about lines at the bank: What about getting stuck in traffic?
SIXPACK: ( grinning )
COBB: Bullshit! I'll tell you what you'd be doing! You'd be watching news on TV that's so fucking bad it makes you nauseous. So you go out and get in your car to get some fresh air and after you've been driving for five minutes you realize the air's so damn dirty you don't dare breath it! That's what you've got to look forward to.
CUT TO: INSIDE THE MESS Everyone looks up as Beck enters and the room goes quiet. Beck notices Doc's empty chair.
BECK: Doc eat already?
JONES: The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
BECK: ( to DeJesus )
DEJESUS: ( obviously embarrassed to be singled out )
BECK: Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
SIXPACK: Yeah, since he was busy earlier when you needed him.
BECK: Cut it, Sixpack. Leave the Doc to me. I'm going to talk to him.
SIXPACK: ( sarcastically, under his breath to Bowman )
BECK: I've been looking at the duty roster.at the shack hours Uh, oh.I see where this is going.
JONES: Uh, oh.I see where this is going.
BECK: ( ignoring Jones )
COBB: ( erupting )
JONES: Whooo! Right on, Cobb! Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
SIXPACK: Hear that Becky, er, Mr. Beck? Company got to abide by the rules.
BECK: I know all about the contract. The point is you can follow the goddamn contract to the letter and pull your shack duty tomorrow.or you can get it done tonight and call tomorrow a down day. It's up to you.
DEJESUS: You giving us a day off?
COBB: What about our quota?
BECK: You're only twenty-five tons off quota. Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day. It's just a day off. You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
JONES: Count me in.
BECK: Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system. Bowman and Sixpack.living quarters.
SIXPACK: ( disgustedly ) ( to group )
BECK: Williams.get DeJesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics. Any other suit problems she should know about?
SIXPACK: ( to Willie )
WILLIE: ( annoyed )
SIXPACK: The latch is screwed up. Or the hinge.
WILLIE: ( disgusted )
WILLIE: You did good.
BECK: ( a little surprised )
WILLIE: Today.with DeJesus. That was smart thinking to get him There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit.
BECK: There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit.
WILLIE: Still.you did the right thing.
DOC: I must have dozed off. Snakebite medicine.Never pack my bag without it.
BECK: Are you planning on working tomorrow?
DOC: Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning. Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver
BECK: ( cutting him off )
DOC: You got something to say to me, son?. I.I think it's important to have the second officer on deck.
BECK: I.I think it's important to have the second officer on deck.
DOC: I'll keep it to nine holes in the morning.
SIXPACK: Christ.what a pair.
BOWMAN: ( sharply )
SIXPACK: I said, "What a pair" the boy wonder Shack Boss and his drunken doctor buddy make. Why? What did ya think I said?
JONES: Listen to it for Christsake.
COBB: Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints.I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here. You gonna sit there on your butt or give me a hand?
BECK: Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
MARTIN: ( taking notes ) MARTIN( cont'd )
BECK: ( smiles, relieved )
MARTIN: Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are. 'Know what I mean? The one thing I've learned in this company is you can't have enough friends. It's the only way to survive.
WILLIE: ( to herself ) WILLIE( cont'd ) WILLIE( cont'd )
COBB: Okay, watch this..
JONES: So that's all you do?.
COBB: Shhhh.don't tell no one. Job security.
WILLIE: ( miffed )
THE DORMITORY: Bowman looks at DeJesus who comes to the door, then to Sixpack who convulses with laughter against the bulkhead.
ON BECK: He hesitates then presses the TALK button on the intercom.
BECK: This is Beck. Is there a problem, Williams?
SWAMP: Willie watches the Sea Spider move in the water toward her as Beck's words come over the P.A. Ignoring Beck she watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings the soldering iron down into the water with a LOUD HISS skewering it. She presses the intercom button and lifts the skewered sea spider out of the water.
WILLIE: ( to Beck )
WILLIE: Made your million, yet?
BOWMAN: ( studying the screen )
WILLIE: How's TransOcean doing?
BOWMAN: You got money in this tub?
WILLIE: I signed-up for the stock option.
DORMITORY: ON COBB He lies on his bunk under a sunlamp, but wears a T-shirt and long pants. DeJesus does a jigsaw puzzle of a snow covered Swiss mountain scene.
DEJESUS: Hey, man, you know that in Switzerlandand this country's the size of East L.A., okay?they speak 54 different dialects? Who cares?
COBB: Who cares?
DEJESUS: I do, man. That's a beautiful place. When I get out of here I'm going there. Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire
DEJESUS: Hey, Cobb.Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man? You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
COBB: ( sharply )
BOWMAN: ( reading ) ( to Willie )
WILLIE: You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
BOWMAN: ( sharply )
WILLIE: Get out of here, Sixpack.
SIXPACK: ( leaving )
JONES: Hey, Bo.when're you going to be off that thing? I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
BOWMAN: ( not taking her eyes off
WILLIE: ( to Jones )
JONES: Jameson? Who're you trying to
DORMITORY: Jones enters the Dorm with his snack and tosses a can of Coke across the room to DeJesus.
JONES: Hey, Hazy! We got a day off tomorrow, Kemosabi! Let's get How about you, brother Cobb? Little Wild Turkey?
DEJESUS: No, man, Cobb is a Chivas drinker, from way back. Ain't that right You guys are crazy. What the hell you play that stupid game for?
COBB: You guys are crazy. What the hell you play that stupid game for?
DEJESUS: ( acting drunk )
COBB: You're on your way somewhere all right.the looney bin.
DEJESUS: ( laughing )
SIXPACK: Oh, Darlin'.come sit on my face. That bitch!
SIXPACK: That bitch!
MESS: Sixpack storms into the Mess with the dead Sea Spider. He points angrily at his bleeding foot. Jones and DeJesus move up to watch.
SIXPACK: ( moving into room )
WILLIE: ( imitating Sixpack )
SIXPACK: You think you're so funny? Wait till you taste this!
SIXPACK: Look at my foot, sir! This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
BECK: ( cold as ice )
SIXPACK: ( trapped )
BECK: All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow
BECK: ( cutting them off )
JONES: Oooooh. Damn! Not so loud. Turn down the music.
COBB: What music? There ain't no
DEJESUS: Cobb looks from one man to the other, realizing what they're
COBB: You know it's really crazy to pretend to be drunk, but it's fucking insane to pretend to have a hangover.
BOWMAN: ( to Jones and DeJesus ) ( imitating Sixpack )
JONES: ( grinning )
COBB: ( pleased )

BECK: I need more light on that, Four.
OUTSIDE: ( to Beck ) ( to Sixpack ) WILLIE( cont'd )

SIXPACK: Sixpack laughs. His lights now on, he stands right behind
WILLIE: You shit..
BECK'S VOICE: What's going on, Four? What's We're fine, Shack. His lights malfunctioned for a minute. How's
WILLIE: We're fine, Shack. His lights malfunctioned for a minute. How's
INSIDE SHACK: Beck looks at the monitor and presses a red button to start the tape, then after five seconds releases the button.
BECK: That's great. Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
WILLIE: ( to Sixpack )
SIXPACK: What's wrong, did you miss me?
WILLIE: Don't worry, darlin, I'm.
SIXPACK: Don't worry, darlin, I'm.
BECK: What's wrong?! What happened?
UNDERWATER: ON WILLIE She has stopped in her tracks. All around her is blackness. Her helmet light hardly penetrates the darkness.
WILLIE: Sixpack?! Sixpack.
WILLIE: He's gone. I think he's fallen. I'm going down after him.
MESS: Jones is bench pressing 200 pounds on a fold-down compact gym, while DeJesus huffs and puffs on an exercise bike.
DEJESUS: That's it Jonesy.Sweat it out, man.Got to get the poison out of our blood.
BOWMAN: Sixpack is lost.
COBB: Weren't they tied? They're supposed to be tied.
CONTROL ROOM: Beck is at the console with Doc in his chair.
JONES: How far away is she?
DOC: Two hundred meters.
DOC: My God, look at the size of those tubers..
DEJESUS: Nine, ten feet high.
BOWMAN: If he had his blinkers on
JONES: It wouldn't make any difference in there.He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
UNDERWATER: ON WILLIE She moves through the dense waving forest of giant tubers, parting them with her hands as she moves CONTROL ROOM
WILLIE: CONTROL ROOM
CONTROL ROOM: Why can't we pick up his signal?
BECK: Why can't we pick up his signal?
DEJESUS: ( a joke )
BOWMAN: ( dryly )
ON WILLIE: She moves aside the last of the tubers and freezes at the sight in front of her.
INSIDE: All eyes suddenly go to the monitor. A huge dark maw fills the screen.
BECK: Affirmative.Widening picture. Tighten the picture on the upper righthand corner.
COBB: What the?.
DOC: WILLIE'S VOICE( RADIO )
BECK: What's your air reading?
WILLIE'S VOICE: Twenty minutes.
BECK: Twenty minutes!.Who had tank duty?
BOWMAN: Who else.Sixpack.
JONES: The man is unbelievable. I say, leave him in there.
BOWMAN: ( dryly )
BECK: ( to Willie )
WILLIE'S POV: Her life-support gauges move eerily around the perimeter of her mask. She moves along steadily down darkened corridors. She opens a door and it drops from its corroded hingesa cloud of sludge rises off the bottom. The room looks empty.
WILLIE: Sixpack?.Answer me. The infirmary.
UNDERWATER: ON WILLIE She moves to the end of the hall. It ends with two doors.
SIXPACK: ( laughing )
SIXPACK: It's all mine if I'm on report. Otherwise you gotta take me off report before you look at any more. Ain't that right, Cobbie?
COBB: You're on your own, Sixpack, you fucked up everybody's day off.
BOWMAN: Personal effects.
WILLIE: ( considering a watch ) WILLIE( cont'd )
JONES: ( checking a wallet )
BOWMAN: ( grinning to Sixpack )
SIXPACK: Shut up.
WILLIE: What is it?
JONES: ( reading ) ( looks up and grins )
DOC: May I see it? It's a log of some sort. What assholes, they lock booze in the safe.
WILLIE: What assholes, they lock booze in the safe.
COBB: What assholes, they lock booze in the safe.
DEJESUS: Probably confiscated. No booze on board, same as us.

BECK: ( leaving )
DEJESUS: You got 'em!
SIXPACK: What good's the kid's med records anyway!
DEJESUS: Watch and learn, amigo.
ON DOC: He stops the tape and presses another button on the console. WILLIE'S VIDEO of the huge hole in the hull of the ship appears on another screen. He looks back at Beck who we see is sitting behind him, and has also been watching the tape. Beck looks at Doc and
BECK: What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
DOC: These observers were doing something. A test.I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
BECK: What mistakes? Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
DOC: I did. They have no record of the wreck. The Marshal Goloviev is now on a tour in the Baltic Sea.
DEJESUS: ( whisper )
BOWMAN'S VOICE: ( on intercom )
DEJESUS: Okay, give it to me.
BOWMAN: ( reading off of Beck's forms ) ( scoffingly ) DEJESUS VOICE ( over intercom )
SIXPACK: ( scoffingly ) DEJESUS VOICE ( over intercom )
DEJESUS VOICE: ( over intercom )
BINGO!: ( suddenly sitting up )
SIXPACK: ( suddenly sitting up )
DOC: I want your permission to check that vodka.
BECK: This is a mining shack, not a lab, Doc. If there's something strange with the vodka it's safe till we get back.
COBB: Beck's coming.
BECK: Something wrong, Cobb?
COBB: ( struggling )
BECK: What's wrong with it?
COBB: ( thinking fast ) ( beat ) BECK( cont'd )
BECK: ( beat ) BECK( cont'd )
BECK: Something wrong?
BOWMAN: Cute, DeJesus.Specimen cups?
JONES: Aw, loosen up, Bowman. Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
WILLIE: No, thanks. I've got my blood tests in three days.
DEJESUS: That's all you do is exercise. You got to learn to live a little.
WILLIE: After my astronaut training physical, then I'll tie one on.
SIXPACK: Forget space cadet, I'll drink hers.
COBB: Hey what happens it he goes back and finds the bottle missing?
DEJESUS: He won't. I poured the vodka in here.
SIXPACK: Shit! It's water!
JONES: Beck switched it!
DEJESUS: Can you beat that? The sonof- abitch doesn't trust us!
SIXPACK: That little turd. If I ever get the chance I'll fix his ass.
DORMITORY: SIXPACK'S BUNK He closes his privacy door and hesitates as if listening for the others, then he removes a silver flask with Cyrillic letteringthe silver object he palmed in the Swampand smiles as he takes a long pull. Suddenly WHAM! The Privacy door to Sixpack's bunk is slammed open. Startled he turns startled to seeBOWMAN.
BOWMAN: Didn't I ever tell you vodka was my favorite drink?
CORRIDOR "B": ON WILLIE She is jogging through the corridors. Suddenly there is a GREAT GROANING NOISE. Willie stops and looks through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor. The dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim light. The GROANING ends and she jogs on to the Swamp. As she passes the door she notices the light and stops. Beck stands with a clipboard by an equipment cabinet filled with the parachute-like Container Transporters we saw outside. He sees her.
BECK: That was a loud one wasn't it?
WILLIE: After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
BECK: ( watching her )
WILLIE: Why? You going to give me hard time like the others?
BECK: No. I'm just being friendly.
WILLIE: ( beat )
BECK: Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
WILLIE: I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps. Why are you here?
BECK: Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line. Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
WILLIE: Has it helped?
WILLIE: I guess there's not a lot of adventure in the Control Room.
BECK: You think I should hang around more with the crew?
WILLIE: Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it. How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
BECK: I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've Maybe you're more one of us than you think.sir.
WILLIE: ( smiles )
JONES: INT. DORMITORY - SAME DeJesus puts on his wet suit which goes under his large mechanical suit and gets ready to join the others in the mess. He notices Sixpack's privacy door is still closed and bangs on it.
DEJESUS: Hey, Sixpack.Rise and shine
DOC: Let's see your tongue.
BECK: What's wrong?
DOC: Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
SIXPACK: Well, it ain't! It feels a thousand times worse.
DOC: I.I dunno. I just feel. Take off your shirt. How long.how long have you had these?
SIXPACK: I.I dunno. I just feel. Take off your shirt. How long.how long have you had these?
DOC: Take off your shirt. How long.how long have you had these?
SIXPACK: ( surprised, scared )
MARTIN: .as long as you know it's not in your contract.
BECK: I know that.
MARTIN: Well, suit yourself, then.its your decision. Ha ha.a little joke.suit
BECK: How's the weather for pickup
MARTIN: ( looking at a report, then up at Beck )
COBB: Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
DEJESUS: ( angrily )
WILLIE: No.he's really sick. I heard him last night. The company will take that into consideration.
JONES: Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
DEJESUS: ( convinced )
BECK: ( to DeJesus )
COBB: There goes our quota.
BOWMAN: Thirty days, right down the toilet.
COBB: Excuse me, sir.
BECK: Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
COBB: No sir.I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
BECK: ( beat )
SIXPACK: ( he's losing it )
DOC: I'm just going to take a tiny piece of skin to look at under the microscope.Afterwards I'll give you a sedative.
ON DOC: He leans back from the microscope. There is awe on his face for the first time since first year medical studiesand there is fear of the unknown. He looks over his shoulder at Sixpack, his shivering has stopped, he lies still on the Lights move in the blackness, but there is an order to the actions and a crispness to the voices. People doing work that is moving sharply. Pride in what they're doing.
UNDERWATER: Lights move in the blackness, but there is an order to the actions and a crispness to the voices. People doing work that is moving sharply. Pride in what they're doing.
DEJESUS: Okay, number 23's full.
BECK: Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
JONES: Yes sir.
BOWMAN: Hook's on 24.
BECK: Let's have her.
DOC: ( to himself )
ON SCREEN: More words come up. ".no idea." He finishes typing and waits for an answer. The cursor flashes the word "PROCESSING". Then an answer comes up. "Genetic Alteration?" The words send a chill down Doc's SWAMP ROOM - LATER The mood is happy. Like a high school football locker room after a winning game. DeJesus climbs out of his suit and slaps Beck on the shoulder.
DEJESUS: Good work out there, Mr. Becky.
JONES: Thank you, sir.
BECK: Dead? This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
DOC: He did.
BECK: Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight
DOC: Here. Put this on. You examine I'm not a doctor.
BECK: I'm not a doctor.
DOC: For this.you don't need to be.
SICK ROOM: As Beck enters, masked, Sixpack's back is to him under the sheets. Slowly he pulls back the sheet and recoils from the sight. The black splotches have nearly all grown together. His fingers have lengthened and become more webbed. Most dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become flared and elongated. Though not bleeding, the open veins are visible.
INFIRMARY: Doc pours some bourbon in a glass, and takes a sip. Beck enters dazed from the sick room and their eyes meet.
BECK: The mask is because you think it might be.catching?
DOC: I don't know. I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses.
BECK: ( impatiently )
DOC: And they didn't believe the symptoms I described.
BECK: ( beat )
DOC: It could be a million things, something in the air, food.. But he went on that ship and so did Williams. I want to examine the crew.
BECK: ( still in shock )
DOC: I've reported the death to the company.
JONES: "Routine," my ass! Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down.especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
COBB: He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine Must be bad. Even sick Sixpack never missed a meal.
WILLIE: Must be bad. Even sick Sixpack never missed a meal.
DEJESUS: It's this fucking air system..
COBB: Ain't the food or the air system, he's just sick. Everybody gets sick every now and then. It's all part of being human!
BOWMAN: Well, I must be human because I'm sure as hell sick.
EXAMINATION SEQUENCE: CLOSE ON WHITE SKIN/( COBB ) Pale skin, fishbelly white with white hairs, seen closely.
COBB: ( watching, nervous )
DOC: You seem all right.
COBS: ( relieved )
JONES: ( grumbling ) ( beat, suspiciously )
DOC: Not yet. You got any ideas?
WILLIE: ( suddenly )
DOC: That's a possibility. But if it was that simple why haven't the symptoms begun on you?
WILLIE: You mean I'm okay?
DOC: You're fine.
DOC: It blackens.becomes scaly.
DEJESUS: ( joking )
DOC: ( almost to himself )
DEJESUS: ( smiles )
MARTIN: Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body. However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
BECK: What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
MARTIN: But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do I'm not anxious to find out, either.
BECK: I'm not anxious to find out, either.
MARTIN: Beck, trust me. If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
BECK: Do it.
MARTIN: ( beat ) MARTIN( cont'd )
BECK: What're you saying? That we're not even going to be picked up It shouldn't be a long delay.
MARTIN: It shouldn't be a long delay.
BECK: But it's a delay! How long? A day? Two days?!
MARTIN: Twelve hours, no big deal. We should know something first thing in the morning. Don't
WILLIE: Bo? Doc says you're next. Bo?.You okay?
JONES: ( whispers )
JONES: Hey, man, we made quota to- day. No thanks to you, you dog, but we made it.Beck helped us.We just dropped Bowman off. I hope what you've got ain't catching. Oh, man, sorry.you go back to sleep.
WILLIE: Who were you talking to?
JONES: How is he?
WILLIE: How is he?
JONES: Sleeping. No sign of Doc, though. I'll check the control room. You look in the shower room.
BOWMAN: Oh, God.what's going on?
SICK ROOM: Bowman approaches the body of Sixpack.
BOWMAN: ( panicked )
DOC: ( panicky )
JONES: Excuse me, sir.Bowman's sick. She's downstairs in the infirmary.
DOC: ( concerned )
JONES: Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
DOC: We're simply concerned about her.proximity to.
BECK: ( to Jones )
JONES: Bullshit.I was just talking to him. I saw him move.
BECK: LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME Beck hits the floor off the ladder and rushes to the Infirmary with Jones. He opens the door and freezes. WHAT HE SEES: The examination table where Jones left her is empty. The room deserted.
JONES: ( pointing to examination table )
SHOWER ROOM: Doc enters the shower room, full of steam and the SOUND OF
DOC: There is no answer and he moves toward the shower.
DOC: Bowman. It's Doc. I'm here to help you.
INFIRMARY: Jones and Beck lay Bowman's body carefully onto the examination table in the infirmary. Through the Sick Room door we see the sheet shrouded body of Sixpack. Doc covers Bowman with a sheet as
BECK: I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
DEJESUS: And it killed Bo?
BECK: No.she killed herself.
JONES: We're getting out of here just in time.
BECK: There's now a problem with the weather for pickup. There's a typhoon in our sector. .We're going to be delayed twelve hours.
DEJESUS: Twelve hours!
JONES: Twelve hours!
COBB: At least we get time and a half. That's in the contract.
JONES: Fuck double pay, man! I want out of here!
BECK: ( motions for Jones to come with him ) ( to the others )
RING CORRIDOR: Beck leads the way slowly toward the Infirmary where the sound is coming from. Outside the door they hear it once more. THUMP! Carefully he enters the Infirmary and WE SEE the examination table is empty! Beck goes to the Sick room and stops in the doorway. Jones moves behind him and his eyes suddenly widen. WHAT THEY SEE: Both bodies now are in a motionless, hideous conglomeration on the the table.
DEJESUS: C'mon, Cobb.you're slacking.
COBB: ( angrily )
BECK: Shut up, all of you.
COBB: Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of-
JONES: Fuck the contract, man!
DEJESUS: Hey!.I feel something. It's moving! He's alive!
COBB: I feel it, too.Someone's trying to get out.
JONES: Cobb, what're you doing!
COBS: But he ain't dead! He ain't Cobb! Stop! It bit me! It bit me!
BECK: Cobb! Stop! It bit me! It bit me!
COBB: It bit me! It bit me!
JONES: Push Hazy!
JONES: Oh, Jesus Christ! I ain't never gonna sleep again!
BECK: It bit me!
COBB: It bit me!
DEJESUS: It's Sixpack!
COBB: I'm going to kill it!
BECK: Close the Lock! Now! Hit it again!
BECK: I think we just found our
DEJESUS: Serves his ass right to get it. Motherfucker brings that shit onboard. I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
JONES: 'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
COBB: He knew better than that. You guys sure weren't so holy when you were shooting that vodka.It could have been you.
WILLIE: You guys sure weren't so holy when you were shooting that vodka.It could have been you.
CONTROL ROOM: Doc and Beck replay the tape of Willie's search for Sixpack on the Russian ship. On the monitor screen we see Willie's POV of the infirmary. The light dances off the broken glass as she turns, then the flash of white we saw before as the light moves out into the corridor.
DOC: Hold it! Rewind it.
DOC: Stop it.
DOC: Back it up slowly.
DOC: ON SCREEN We see it. Caught in the turn of the camera, now frozen on the screen is the clear gleaming skeletal remains of a man. Only it is clear that this is no ordinary man. Fingers and appendages are lengthened and broader than normal. But it is the large head and long sharp teeth that especially catches our attention.
DEJESUS: You know that Innsbruck has 64 square miles of ski slopes, man? Think about that. Sixty-four square miles.
JONES: How'd you do that?
DEJESUS: What? That?.I've done this one before. You hungry? I'm Hungry? After what we just went through I may never eat again.
JONES: Hungry? After what we just went through I may never eat again.
ON WILLIE: She jogs down the corridors toward the Swamp. The Shack CREAKS and Willie looks down through the grating passing below her feet. It is dark down there. Her feet pound off the metal grating. LOW ANGLE We watch Willie from below as she jogs past. THEN WE TILT DOWN to the dark, still water of the bilge. Suddenly something stirs in the watera ripple like a trout in a CONTROL ROOM - SAME Using a computer plotting program to measure the dimensions of the skull on the videotape, Doc enters these measurements as they are read off to him by Beck. As each of the measurements go into the computer an image of a skull begins to appear on the computer screen, followed by a name:
BECK: They found this?
DOC: No. I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus.
BECK: Was there such a thing?
DOC: Danakil man?.one of our ancestors. Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
BECK: Not exactly a big ocean It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water. Most homo sapiens didn't make it.Danakil man.
DOC: It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water. Most homo sapiens didn't make it.Danakil man.
ON WILLIE: running. She jogs past the machine room. Looking in, the machines seem alive, pulsing, the beating heart of the Shack. There is something else though. We feel something in there watching her.
CONTROL ROOM: On Doc.
DOC: Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming But what about those scales. or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
BECK: But what about those scales. or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
DOC: Why stop with just one aspect of marine life? Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?.
BECK: ( pointing to screen )
DOC: ( beat )
JONES' VOICE: Turned black yet?
COBS: That ain't funny.
JONES: Relax, Cobb. If it was going to turn, it would have done its trick by now.
COBB: That's easy for you to say. You ain't the one that got bit. Don't tell me you're getting soft on us, Cobbie? You're the fellow who always said
JONES: Don't tell me you're getting soft on us, Cobbie? You're the fellow who always said
COBB: Nothing's changed, goddamnit!
SWAMP: Willie enters and checks her running time on her watch. She bends over to catch her breath then straightens suddenly.
OVERHEAD SHOT: WE are watching her from above. For a moment she is quiet as if listening for a noise somewhere in the Swamp. She looks around slowly and her eyes come to rest on the MESS - SAME DeJesus looking for food. In the gloom of fluorescent lighting he opens and closes various cabinets looking for a He notices that the floor's wet near the sink. He frowns and hears a SMALL NOISE, like something shifting slightly. He moves to investigate, crouching low, peeking into the shadows under the sink, into a litter of cleanser bottles, pails, rags.All he can see are shadows. He looks more closely, actually sticking his head under the sink when
JONES: Man, everybody is jumpy. What are you doing? Getting some food.
DEJESUS: Getting some food.
JONES: Under there? Look. Water.
DEJESUS: Look. Water.
JONES: Probably the plumbing. You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what? No, I'll be right there.
DEJESUS: No, I'll be right there.
DEJESUS: ( to himself )
DEJESUS: ( muttering to himself )
DEJESUS: ( in pain )
JONES: Hey, Hazy.what're you doing Holy shit!
DEJESUS: Help me, Jonesy. Oh, God, help me! It's getting inside me, I can feel it! Hazy, please.I'm going to get you some help, man.just don't touch me.
JONES: Hazy, please.I'm going to get you some help, man.just don't touch me.
COBB: What's going on?
JONES: It's Hazy.It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out. I'm going to get the Doc.
DEJESUS: Help me! Help me!
JONES: It's got Hazy!
BECK: What has?
JONES: One of those chunks of Sixpack! Like a big leech, with those teeth!.
DOC: We've got to get him to the What are you going to do to I'm going to try to remove it.
JONES: What are you going to do to I'm going to try to remove it.
DOC: I'm going to try to remove it.
JONES: I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
JONES: Cobb? Hazy? Oh, shit.He's
JONES: You let him get away!
COBB: I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
JONES: my friend.
BECK: Shut up, both of you! We've got to find it. Where's Willie?
COBB: Oh, God, she's out there.
BECK: Jones.come with me. Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
SWAMP: They enter the quiet Swamp. The suits hang silently like sleeping monsters. Beck steps into the equipment room. Jones walks along the suits which hang in front of him. Their empty masks stare at him hauntingly. He reaches the end and stands in front of the ladder where we earlier saw Willie doing chin-ups. He looks down and sees her headband floating in the bilgewater.
JONES: Suddenly Willie lowers herself from the bar behind him.
WILLIE: The sudden sight of her nearly gives Jones heart failure, he stumbles backwards into the ankle deep water and Willie drops from the bar laughing.
WILLIE: ( grinning )
JONES: I ought to smack your face!
WILLIE: What's wrong?
JONES: DeJesus.It's got him.
BECK: I thought they were your friends?
JONES: Were, Doss You fire that in here and you'll bring the whole place
BECK: You fire that in here and you'll bring the whole place
JONES: ( to intercom ) JONES( cont'd ) ( to Beck )
BECK: No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted. I thought DeJesus fixed that?
JONES: ( beat, realizing )
COBB: What happened?
DOC: ( absently )
COBB: What was it?
THE MESS: The remaining group is assembled around the table. Jones watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers. He
COBS: ( excitedly )
BECK: Bigger than DeJesus? How?
JONES: Bigger than DeJesus? How?
DOC: It's had a meal.
WILLIE: It needs blood?
JONES: Fucking great.You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
DOC: It would explain the suction- like appendages.
JONES: Like a leech.
BECK: That's why there's a dead one on the ship. It ran out of blood.
JONES: What dead one on the ship? Someone want to let the rank and file in on your little
DOC: The monster appears to be a genetic aberration.
JONES: No fuckin' lie.
DOC: .It has many traits of deep sea marine life.regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy. but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other
COBB: ( panicky )
BECK: ( to Doc )
DOC: Intelligence may not be the right Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part I don't know. I'm guessing.
JONES: Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part I don't know. I'm guessing.
DOC: ( tiredly )
COBB: ( losing it )
JONES: And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?.No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
WILLIE: What can we do?
BECK: Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
COBB: And how're we going to do that?
DOC: Be careful with it.
BECK: Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
DOC: Still bothering you?
COBB: Itches like hell.
DOC: Take it off and let me have a look.
DOC: Looks good to me. I'll re-bandage it, though. Willie, would you clean it for me. I'm going to the infirmary for supplies.
WILLIE: You can't go out there alone.
DOC: I'm the Doctor. I have to do what's best for this crew. I need my bag.
CONTROL ROOM: Doc moves behind the computer keyboard in the dim light of the Control room. His face lit by the computer monitor. He types furiously.
COMPUTER SCREEN: "Emergency Escape Bubbles.ready for activation." DOC pauses looking at the message, then moves his hand to the SEND command and presses it.
DOC: There, good as new. Just keep your paws off of it. Do you have the new bandage ready?
WILLIE: She steps back and Doc moves into her place as suddenly a leech-mouthed tentacle erupts from Cobb's waist. It's razor sharp proboscis punctures Doc's chest right at the heart and the leach mouth with it's hundreds of teeth attaches with vacuum-like suction.
DOC: But it is too late. Willie falls back screaming as Cobb's gash RRRRRRRIPS OPEN! THE FLESH OPENING GROTESQUELY FROM
CORRIDOR "B": CLOSE ON THE POOL OF BLOOD A huge shadow falls over the pool left by Beck. A scaly tentacle suddenly whips across the floor. The DEJESUS
ON BECK: A little behind him with the homemade flamethrower, Jones waits in the shadows. Suddenly Beck hears something.
BECK: ( whispers ) BECK( cont'd )
JONES: Don't worry.
JONES: C'mon baby c'mon.
ON WILLIE: She turns the corner and freezes. There, less than ten feet away is the Creature. A tentacle whips excitedly like a AS THE CREATURE starts to turn for Willie, Beck suddenly closes the vault-like door to the swamp on Creature's hand, trapping it vise-like in the door.
WILLIE: Oh God.
BECK: Run Willie! Run!
JONES: Well done. Just like momma makes 'em.
ON WILLIE: She turns down Corridor "A". A NOISE overhead in the water conduit causes her to look up WHEN SUDDENLY A BLACK ARM
BECK: ( whispered )
WILLIE: ( recovering )
JONES: Oh man, that's just great.
BECK: CONTROL ROOM Beck is followed inside by Jones and Willie. It is empty.
CONTROL ROOM: Beck is followed inside by Jones and Willie. It is empty.
BECK: Lock the door.
BECK: Shit! He sent them all.
WILLIE: The escape bubbles?
JONES: ( gravely )
WILLIE: What is it?
JONES: The good doctor signed our death warrant.
WILLIE: Well, at least we're safe inside For how long?
JONES: For how long?
MARTIN: Thank goodness, you're still Hey, man, you better get your ass out here right now and get us. You hear me, motherfucker? Right now!
JONES: ( yells nervously at the screen )
MARTIN: Please relax, Mr. Jones. Every- thing is under control. Naturally, when we received Dr. Warren's message we were concerned but would never have deserted you. Well, that's the bad news. The typhoon did turn your way. Right now it is on a course
WILLIE: ( smiles nervously ) ( he looks at weather printout )
MARTIN: ( smiles nervously ) ( he looks at weather printout )
JONES: Just answer the question, man! When are you coming?!
MARTIN: ( beat )
BECK: Forty-eight hours!
MARTIN: I realize you must have gone through hell
JONES: Gone? Man, we're still here!
MARTIN: ( firmly )
BECK: He's right. Why don't you get some rest. I'll stand the first watch.
CLOSED.": ( to himself )
BECK: ( to himself )
WILLIE: They know, don't they?
BECK: ( quietly )
WILLIE: Maybe they already have.
BECK: What are you doing?
WILLIE: Seeing how my stock's doing.
WILLIE: ( impatiently )
BECK: I can't believe they'd just leave us.
JONES: Welcome to the union, boss. We're all expendable.
WILLIE: What is it?
JONES: The air's stopped.
BECK: We're on backup air.
WILLIE: How much time does that give Less than an hour. It's ruptured an air duct.
BECK: Less than an hour. It's ruptured an air duct.
WILLIE: Can't we fix it?
JONES: There're twenty miles of pipe in the bilge, they could have tapped-in anywhere.
JONES: ( almost to himself )
BECK: They're drawing us out. You can't go out there, that's what they want.
WILLIE: You can't go out there, that's what they want.
BECK: We don't have much choice. without air, the internal pressure will fall and
JONES: Willie watches them a moment then picks up one of the mining tools, the laser-drill, she powers-it up to check it. Her action stops both men and she catches their looks.
WILLIE: You don't think I'm sitting in here, do you?
WILLIE: ( low )
JONES: She's wondering what's happening. We're losing air faster than I thought.
BECK: ( to Jones )
BECK: I'll go first.
WILLIE: Don't spend all day down Don't fuckin' worry, I
JONES: Don't fuckin' worry, I
BILGE: From somewhere in the darkness we hear the HISSING SOUND OF ESCAPING OXYGEN and the FAMILIAR RATTLE OF THE AIR SYSTEM. As soon as Jones reaches the bottom rung Beck shines a light into the eerie underground area. Pipes run overhead and on the walls. A broken electrical conduit sparks over their heads. The floor is ankle deep in greasy water. They start toward the noise.
ON WILLIE: Her back is to the solid wall( outside wall ). Her eyes move from one end of the corridor to the other, not lingering long enough to distract her. Sweat runs down her face and we hear another tremor in the Shack.
WILLIE: ( to herself, calming herself ) ( beat, quietly at first ) WILLIE( cont'd )
BILGE: ON BECK He moves around a corner we recognize from before with Jones' and Cobb's repair. Beck floods the area with light and the break in the line is visible. The pipe has been torn from the wall, it is totally unreparable. What's worse, electrical wires hang down, showering sparks into the
JONES: Jesus Christ.
BECK: Can you fix it?
JONES: No way.
BECK: Think! Can we stop it?! Block it up?! Shut down the line somewhere?! Think!
JONES: I am thinking, man! You think I want to die! I am thinking! I
JONES: I hit it. But I can't see it! Can you see it?!
BECK: ( standing ) ( screams )
JONES: The Swamp. There's an over- ride switch in the Swamp. Hurry.Get out!
JONES: ( screams )
BECK: Hurry.Get out!
BECK: Jones! Get your feet out of the water!
BECK: C'mon, the Swamp!
JONES: Jones moves instinctively back for him, but another jolt only widens the gap. Beck yells to be heard over the din of the collapsing Shack.
BECK: Go on!
JONES: That's an order!
BECK: That's an order!
JONES: Fuck your orders!
BECK ARRIVES: It's jammed!
WILLIE: It's jammed!
JONES: Where the hell've you been?
BECK: I got hung up! Try this!
VIBRATIONS: THE WALLS SHAKE THE HUGE METAL SUITS ROCK LIKE CLOTHES ON A CLOTHES LINE. ONE FALLS AND CRASHES INTO THE WATER JONES throws open the control panel and grabs the red handled emergency air switch, but he can only move it half way! It is jammed by the pressure.
JONES: It won't go!
BECK: The suits! Get in them!
JONES: The suits! Are you crazy! How're we going to get to the surface?
BECK: Like this. Get them in the Lock!
JONES: Your suit, Becky!
BECK: Just get in yours!
WILLIE: ( screams )
BECK: ( to the others )
BECK: Go, now! That's an order!
DEJESUS: Kill me.Kill me!
BECK: He hits again, still nothing! THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE."Nineteen, eighteen." Her voice begins to quiver.
BECK'S LEG!: CLOSE ON THE ELVATOR BUTTON Beck pounds it one last time and NNNNNNNNNNNN!
ON BECK: He follows her look. Light is coming fast, brightening as they rise. The LED numbers inside their helmets click off."125, 100, 75."
WILLIE: We made it!
BECK: Where's Jones?
WILLIE: Is he okay? The sun! The sun!
JONES: What happened to that typhoon?
WILLIE: Are you sure you saw something?
JONES: How many times I got to tell you. I saw a ship.
WILLIE: Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
BECK: We'll fire one more, that leaves us one last one.
WILLIE: Are you okay, Jonesy?
JONES: ( weakly )
WILLIE: ( testing him )
JONES: ( tired, but with fight )
BECK: I'll be damned. Look!.A flare!
WILLIE: It saw us!
JONES: Answer them and quit kicking me!
WILLIE: I'm not touching you!
WILLIE: No.no, no, no.
CAPTAIN: I thought you said you'd combed this area?
MARTIN: We did..Many times.
CAPTAIN: ( looks at Martin then to a Lieutenant )
WILLIE: ( panicky )
BECK: I can't see them!
JONES: All right! I've had enough of this shit! You want meat, motherfucker? Come on, eat me, sucker, try some dark meat! What's wrong you snout-nosed bastards? My meat too tough for you?! Whoa! Did you see those fools run? They know whose boss.
UNDERWATER POV: As Jones crows triumphantly, WE SUDDENLY SEE HIS WET SUIT
UNDERWATER: JONES' LEGS His wet suit is now completely split open and
THE HELICOPTER: hovers over the group below and lands on the water. Its blades beat the surface into waves. The WINCH OPERATOR hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the ring. He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock eyes. Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety. Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm.
BECK: Jonesy.Give me your hand!
BECK: C'mon, Jones!
BECK: Jonesy, No!
JONES: Get out of here, Becky!
ON HELICOPTER: The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the Creature bears down on Beck.
WINCH OPERATOR: Is he in the harness!
BECK: C'mon, motherfucker open up!
CAPTAIN: Mr. Beck, I understand you passed your physical with flying colors. And Ms. Williams?
BECK: ( worried )
CAPTAIN: Well, you'll be glad to know you have a friend onboard.
MARTIN: ( excitedly ) ( smiling )
BECK: Better.A lot better.
WILLIE: I'm fine!
CAPTAIN: I thought we might have some wonderful seafood. But, if there's something else you'd rather have.
WILLIE: How about a burger and fries?
