JESSICA: I would have brought the car back, but I need it.
CARLOS: So you ask.
JESSICA: I said I'm sorry.
CARLOS: Yeah right. And why the hell are you still driving?
JESSICA: The Car stops, Carlos and Jessica climb out of the Car and pass in back of it without a word. Carlos climbs into the driver seat, and Jessica the passenger seat. Jessica grabs Carlos's Nachos and starts munching them down, dipping each one into the CHEESE SAUCE that is on the side.
CARLOS: Where's the squirt?
JESSICA: At my place watching TV.
CARLOS: You left her alone?
JESSICA: Just for a minute. I left my novel at You need it now? Aren't you supposed to be watching her?

JESSICA: You should go for it. Drain them pipes.
CARLOS: Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

HEATHER: Don't you hang up!
DEREK: Then calm down. You told me to tell you when you're in one of your moods? Well guess what?
HEATHER: See? That asshole's cheating.
ALLISON: Just because he won't move in with you doesn't mean he's cheating.
HEATHER: Ally, he's a cheater. That's what he does - he cheats. Now it's my turn just like all the others.
ALLISON: Allison gets up and follows Heather toward the parking lot.

ALLISON: He took too long for you?
HEATHER: Ally, I'd be done, and I'd have to lie there like another hour 'till he got off. I couldn't fucking stand it. Why the hell do you think I started on the pill, Ally? Me. Putting that hormone shit in my body.
