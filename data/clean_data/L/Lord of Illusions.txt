TITLE SEQUENCE: As the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences:
BUTTERFIELD: ( softly ) He turns from the door. In his haste he drops the WOOD he's whittling. He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.
BUTTERFIELD: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY A dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of their leader, WILLIAM NIX. His black hair grows to his shoulders. His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice seductive. A terrifying yet charismatic presence. All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives - wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. They watch Nix in adoration. As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to hand with casual ease.
NIX: And the fire said to me: Nix, Nix, you're my instrument. From now on, you'll be called the Puritan.
CULTISTS: ( murmuring ) NIX You will find a few good men and women, and together, together you will cleanse the world.
CULTISTS: Butterfield enters.
BUTTERFIELD: Nix looks up.
BUTTERFIELD: Swann's here. Nix rises, smiling.
NIX: ( to Cultists ) We'll come back to this. Get about your business. As the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into
NIX: Nix goes to the GIRL. She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and presently in a state of mortal fear. She sits, bound, in a fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.
NIX: I said hush.
GIRL: Please. Let me go. From the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. Nix goes to it. The animal is large and lethal.
NIX: ( to Baboon ) What is it? The Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring its teeth as it screeches.
NIX: ( to Girl ) I think he's in love. He unshackles the Baboon. The animal pads toward the Girl, trailing its chain.
GIRL: Keep it away from me. Nix catches hold of its chain. Holds it back. The Baboon starts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS catching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.
GIRL: Please. please. Nix watches her terror dispassionately.
BUTTERFIELD: ( also watching, wide- eyed ) Want me to shoot Swann?
NIX: You don't like him, do you?
BUTTERFIELD: He wants your magic.
NIX: Maybe. Go fetch him. Butterfield exits. Nix advances on the Girl.
GIRL: What are you going to do?
SWANN: ( to all three ) Are we ready?
JENNIFER: ( cool ) Say the word.
PIMM: ( very nervous ) Look, maybe we should think this over. On Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces of METALWORK. We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as he slips them into his pocket.
SWANN: No. He's gone too far.
PIMM: So he took a child.
JENNIFER: He'll kill her.
PIMM: No he won't.
SWANN: ( determined ) He's not going to get the chance. Quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.
QUAID: If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.
SWANN: So stay out here. Swann starts towards the House. Jennifer is the first to follow, with the other two on her heels.
BUTTERFIELD: He's expecting you. Behind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks.
SWANN: ( to others ) Look around. If you find 'the child, yell. She's got blonde hair, that's all I know. Butterfield turns away, smiling to himself. Swann follows INT. NIX'S HOUSE - "MEDITATION" ROOM - DAY Quaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS ( three men and two women ) still sit. One of the women is breast-feeding a baby.
1ST MAN: Hey, Quaid. I thought you said you weren't coming back.
QUAID: I changed my mind.
1ST WOMAN: Come and join us. She smiles a crazy smile. Reaches out for Quaid. A SNAKE appears from around the back of her neck. Quaid recoils. And now we see that there are snakes everywhere. In the Cultists' clothes and hair. Even on the baby. Quaid turns away. And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame, winding around his hand. He strikes it to the ground, and drives his heel down on its head.
JENNIFER: Don't be afraid. The Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over. She has a dirty cloth pressed to a wound between her breasts. It is not the Girl, of course. She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.
BARBARA: I'm not. want to see? She pulls the cloth away. She has carved the cult SIGIL into her FLESH. The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer retreats to the door, and exits back out into
PIMM: He's going to kill us all.
JENNIFER: Where did Swann go? Pimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room.
QUAID: Stay the fuck away! Pimm! Get over here!
SWANN: You're going to be okay. Out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings round. Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque The Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder. Terror crosses her face. Swann turns.
NIX: I knew you'd come. He reaches down to Swann.
NIX: I've got so much power to give you, Swann. All you have to do Fuck you.
SWANN: Fuck you.
NIX: You don't think I've got it to Suddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying You're wrong. He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back against the wall.
SWANN: Suddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back against the wall.
NIX: You're wrong. He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back against the wall.
NIX: I could eat your fucking soul, INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY Jennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum. Butterfield steps from the shadows. His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's hand. BLOOD SPURTS.
JENNIFER: She retreats, staunching her bleeding hand.
NIX: You want to know what the world really looks like? Swann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold. And now horribly Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.
NIX: Want to see flesh with a god's Swann SCREAMS as Nix's mind-hold seizes him.
QUAID: Get away from the door! Butterfield shakes his head. Quaid FIRES. The bullet. strikes the wall beside Butterfield's head. He retreats, growling like a rabid animal. Quaid kicks the Sanctum door open, and enters.
QUAID: ( to Quaid ) Here he is. Swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his eyes blood-red.
NIX: ( to Quaid ) Here he is. Swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his eyes blood-red.
NIX: Take a look, Swann! These are your On Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and What have you done to him?
SWANN: Don't touch me. He's got. got into my head.
NIX: You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit? Swann turns away from Quaid and Jennifer in disgust.
NIX: Come here. Share the power. ON a GUN, leveled. .We don't see by whom. The trigger is The bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest. ON SWANN, staring at Nix. SWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies. Just for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses something else. MORPHING out of Nix's features. A NIGHTMARE FACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its Swann covers his eyes.
NIX: ( raging, terrifying ) Swann! Swann! Nix staggers, letting out an ungodly HOWL, and drops to his knees, clutching the WOUND. As he falls, he reveals the ashen Girl, who is still holding Swann's smoking GUN.
NIX: ( a roar ) Help me! Swann shakes his head, ridding himself of Nix's mind- INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE SANCTUM - DAY Pinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists.
SWANN: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE SANCTUM - DAY Pinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists.
1ST CULTIST: ( with distressing confidence ) You can't kill him.
2ND CULTIST: He'll just rise up again!
NIX: Help me! Quaid FIRES at him again. Strikes his shoulder. And again. Strikes his leg. Nix collapses to the ground,
JENNIFER: They have come prepared for this. Swann now takes from his jacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK. There are SCREWS in then all.
NIX: ( seeing ) Swann? What are you doing?
SWANN: Binding you. He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES. It fits like an eyeless mask. Nix thrashes and SCREAMS. Swann lays his hands on the side of the mask, and Â— LIKE MAGIC his touch makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND. BLOOD runs from the screw-holes.
NIX: Fuck you, Swann! Fuck you! Now the second piece, over his MOUTH.
NIX: He's silenced. The piece screws itself into-his head, like the first. And now comes the third and final piece: over the nose and into the ears. Again, it screws itself into Swann has done all he can. He retreats from Nix's body, as it continues to convulse. We go from face to ashen face, as each man and woman watches and waits. Why won't he die? And now, at last the violence of Nix's death-throes diminishes. Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.
GIRL: ( quietly ) Is it finished?
SWANN: It's finished.
PIMM: What now?
QUAID: What now?
PIMM: What now?
SWANN: We bury him so deep no one will ever find him.
FADE OUT: FADE IN EXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAY The city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking some fantastical metropolis. This, for all its smog and congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments. ON SCREEN, the words: "LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"

This, for all its smog and congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments. ON SCREEN, the words: "LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"
BLONDE GIRL: How'd you spell that again?
HARRY: D.A.M.O.U.R. D'Amour. Harry Isn't that French for something? ON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door.
BLONDE GIRL: BLONDE GIRL Isn't that French for something? ON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door.
HARRY: BLONDE GIRL Isn't that French for something? ON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door.
BLONDE GIRL: Isn't that French for something? ON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door.
BELLBOY: Mister D'Amour?
HARRY: ( to Blonde ) Yeah. It's French.
BLONDE GIRL: For love, right?
BELLBOY: Mister D'Amour?
HARRY: ( to Blonde ) ( grinning ) That's so cool.
BLONDE GIRL: ( grinning ) That's so cool.
BELLBOY: Mister D'Amour? Harry turns. He's wearing a washed-out Grateful Dead t- shirt, an Italian cut linen suit, and glasses. He's handsome, unshaven, 35-ish, with an open easy smile.
HARRY: You haven't paid the cab. He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
BELLBOY: You haven't paid the cab. He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
HARRY: How much?
BELLBOY: Thirty-five bucks.
HARRY: Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
HARRY: Just kidding. Harry gets out his wallet and hands over four ten-dollar I've got my life in there.
HARRY: I've got my life in there.
HARRY: Hello, L.A.
BELLBOY: Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
HARRY: You bet.
HARRY: Nine-eighteen p.m. Tapert's either got a great sense of humour or he's paying her to laugh. disgust ) On Tapert, as he rises from the table.
HARRY: ( into tape recorder ) He's finished. Tapert exits the restaurant, and crosses the street. Harry tosses his half-eaten hamburger away, and goes to his car.
HARRY: ( into tape ) Nine twenty-six p.m. He's off He turns the key in the ignition.
HARRY: He starts across the street. Suddenly:
MILLER: INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT A mysterious, candle-lit space. In the middle of the room, a table. At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been tortured close to death. Several small SCALPELS protrude from his chest and neck. His life is ebbing away. On the table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED. Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.
HARRY: What the fuck!? Harry picks up the PHONE. It's dead. Miller charges at the Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. As he does so, the candles FLICKER. Harry looks up. A FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid. He's in his late twenties: an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long hair is drawn back into a pony-tail. His mismatched eyes - one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.
HARRY: Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. As he does so, the candles FLICKER. Harry looks up. A FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid. He's in his late twenties: an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long hair is drawn back into a pony-tail. His mismatched eyes - one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.
HARRY: ( to Butterfield ) Don't touch him." Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek. Quaid sobs in pain.
BUTTERFIELD: What are you going to do about it? Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the other side. His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock out. Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.
BUTTERFIELD: ( to Harry ) Ever watched a man die? If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
QUAID: Please. Butterfield. I wasn't there. Ask Pimm.
BUTTERFIELD: Pimm's dead. Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared. They knew the Puritan was coming home. As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other side. It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being pitched across the room. He looks around for some means of defense. There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the table. Behind it a WINDOW.
BUTTERFIELD: So do you. You've seen the future. Haven't you?
QUAID: And are you afraid?
BUTTERFIELD: And are you afraid?
QUAID: Suddenly, Harry steps aside. The door's flung open. Miller CHARGES in. Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him against the drape. The window CRACKS; the drape comes down around Miller. Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. Butterfield is momentarily distracted. Harry STRIKES the scalpel from his hands. Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the folds of the drapes. Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's belly. Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window, which SHATTERS. Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already making his escape. Harry starts after him.
QUAID: ( to Harry ) Don't leave me. He turns back. TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the You need an ambulance.
HARRY: You need an ambulance.
QUAID: ( in pain ) Too late. Why are you here? Did you cone. up here for a reading? Quaid takes hold of Harry's hand.
HARRY: NO . I. Quaid stares at Harry's HAND. Fascinated, he momentarily forgets his pain. He traces the lines with bloody fingers.
QUAID: ( quietly ) My God.
HARRY: You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
QUAID: You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
HARRY: Yeah. You could say that.
QUAID: You're drawn to the dark side, over and over. And it's drawn to you. You don't like that.
HARRY: Not much.
QUAID: You can't change it. You have to .walk the line between Heaven and Hell. It's your destiny. Accept Harry takes his hand from Quaid's grip. Quaid winces in Hold on.
HARRY: Hold on.
QUAID: I'm not afraid to die. There's something terrible. coming The Puritan?
HARRY: The Puritan?
QUAID: Who is he? Quaid shudders, and dies.
HARRY: Who is he? Quaid shudders, and dies.
HARRY: ( softly; sadly ) He looks away, down at the CARDS. All have been turned over but ONE. He turns it. The card is the Ten of Swords which pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by all ten swords. An image of death and desolation.
EDDISON: ( to Harry ) What were you doing up there?
HARRY: I'm a private detective. I was hired to follow somebody for a few days. A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
EDDISON: ( writing ) Tapert. So, now I've got Tapert, Tapert's got nothing to do with this. He came here to get his palm What makes you so sure?
HARRY: Tapert's got nothing to do with this. He came here to get his palm What makes you so sure?
EDDISON: What makes you so sure?
HARRY: ( shrugs ) I got a file on him two inches thick. He's a petty fraudster. This is something else. Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
EDDISON: New one on me. Okay. Let's see him. OFFICER #l shakes his head, and opens up the drape. Broken GLASS drops from the folds, but that's all. Miller has gone.
EDDISON: Where the fuck is he?
HARRY: He got up and walked.
EDDISON: ( looking up at window ) After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones. WE MOVE IN ON HARRY, as he stares down at the drape.
HARRY: I don't think he'd have given a INT. BUTTERFIELD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The rooms are spartan. Nothing on the walls. Nothing on the floors. Very little furniture. Butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his long hair. There is something feminine about him now: his voice a whisper, his stare distracted. If we didn't guess it already, we're in the presence of a madman. Miller is squatting against the wall, picking shards of GLASS out of his torso. It hurts, but he's enjoying himself.
BUTTERFIELD: D'Amour. D'Amour. Why do I know that name?
MILLER: I know him. I saw him. He stops to pull out a particularly large piece of glass, sighing with pleasure.
MILLER: I saw him on T.V. Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
BUTTERFIELD: He's a priest?
MILLER: No. He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit. Like you. A long beat of silence. Butterfield combs. Miller digs for I don't want him getting in the He won't. Another silence.
BUTTERFIELD: I don't want him getting in the He won't. Another silence.
MILLER: He won't. Another silence.
BUTTERFIELD: ( dreamily ) We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
MILLER: What do you mean, "all of us?"
BUTTERFIELD: You didn't think it was just going to be you and me? A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
MILLER: What about death?
BUTTERFIELD: What about death?
MILLER: What about death?
BUTTERFIELD: ( a beat ) It's an illusion.
RADIO: "I really want to see you, Lord, And it won't take long, my Lord, My sweet Lord."
CLEMENZIA: Coffee, Mrs. Swann? Mrs. Swann's name is DOROTHEA. She is a beautiful and sensual woman.
DOROTHEA: Thank you. She dries off.
DOROTHEA: Where's Mr. Swann?
CLEMENZIA: In his study. He got something on his mind?
DOROTHEA: Bad mood today.
CLEMENZIA: Bad mood today.
DOROTHEA: Bad show last night?
SWANN: ( wearily ) The usual. Full house. Standing ovation. I tell them it's magic.
DOROTHEA: ( distastefully ) . they believe you.
SWANN: ( a beat ) Remember Quaid?
DOROTHEA: Somebody killed him.
SWANN: Somebody killed him.
DOROTHEA: Oh God.
SWANN: ( disturbed ) I just saw him. A difficult silence. Then Swann crosses to the door.
SWANN: I'm putting in a new illusion tonight. Will you be there?
DOROTHEA: Sure. You want me to find out about Quaid? I mean, the funeral?
SWANN: ( superstitiously ) I'm not going near him.
VALENTIN: Higher. Another inch. The left hand side's too low. Dorothea descends the stairs, dressed for the day.
DOROTHEA: ( to Hangers ) Good. There. ( to Dorothea ) ( gives him the newspaper ) You saw this? Valentin nods. They walk back through the house together, while the picture-hanging goes on behind them.
VALENTIN: ( to Hangers ) Good. There. ( to Dorothea ) ( gives him the newspaper ) You saw this? Valentin nods. They walk back through the house together, while the picture-hanging goes on behind them.
DOROTHEA: ( gives him the newspaper ) You saw this? Valentin nods. They walk back through the house together, while the picture-hanging goes on behind them.
DOROTHEA: I want you to find this man D'Amour for me. She passes the newspaper to Valentin. He looks down at it.
HARRY: ( waking ) He rolls over. The sun strikes his eyes. He winces.
HARRY: VALENTIN ( V.O. ) Mr. D'Amour?
HARRY: Go away.
HARRY: What are you, my mother?
HARRY: Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay? I get a few drinks inside me
VALENTIN: We've never met.
HARRY: Then what do you want?
VALENTIN: I'm here to offer you a job.
HARRY: I'm going back to New York in Shit! I'm outta here.
VALENTIN: Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day? A beat. Then Harry takes the chain off the door.
HARRY: Do I get lunch?
HARRY: Whose is the car?
VALENTIN: Nah. You're driving it too Maybe I just bought it.
HARRY: Nah. You're driving it too Maybe I just bought it.
VALENTIN: ( sparring ) Maybe I just bought it.
HARRY: Somebody's been smoking in here for He pulls open the ashtray. Pulls out a cigar-butt.
HARRY: Havanas. You're not the smoker. So who is?
VALENTIN: ( laughs ) You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour. ( a beat ) I work for the best illusionist in the world.
HARRY: Philip Swann?
VALENTIN: You know of him?
HARRY: I saw him in Vegas once.
VALENTIN: Are you a gambling man?
HARRY: When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
VALENTIN: Never call him that. He's strictly an illusionist.
HARRY: What's the difference?
VALENTIN: Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
HARRY: Any movie stars buried here?
VALENTIN: It's not a bad place. Warm. Great view.
HARRY: It's not a bad place. Warm. Great view.
VALENTIN: I don't think the dead much care.
HARRY: Are you sure?
VALENTIN: Are you a believer, then? Valentin gives him an inquisitive look.
HARRY: I've signed on for them all in my time. Hindu. Catholic. You can't have too many saviours. Harry's gaze is on the mausoleum now; or rather on the woman in white standing in its cool shadows: Dorothea Swann. She wears a wide-brimmed hat.
HARRY: Who is she?
VALENTIN: Swann's wife.
DOROTHEA: I want you to help me help my husband. I know he's in some kind of trouble. And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
HARRY: Did your husband know Quaid?
DOROTHEA: Yes. They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while. I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
HARRY: You don't?
DOROTHEA: I think we make our own futures. Harry makes an approving MURMUR.
HARRY: What's the connection?
DOROTHEA: ( covering now, but well ) I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
HARRY: Why not? Dorothea stops talking. Takes off her sunglasses. Her gaze is troubled, but direct. There is an attraction between the two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue.
DOROTHEA: He's a secretive man.
HARRY: And you don't ask questions?
DOROTHEA: We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
HARRY: Does that mean.?
DOROTHEA: We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
HARRY: But obviously you still care what happens to him.
DOROTHEA: We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men Harry, frowns.
DOROTHEA: You don't believe me.
HARRY: He's an illusionist. It's not exactly brain surgery. Dorothea stares at him.
HARRY: Sorry. You asked.
DOROTHEA: No. You're right. He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more. But people get lost. Even good people. Too much fame. Too much money,
HARRY: Where do I sign? Dorothea LAUGHS lightly.
DOROTHEA: Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
HARRY: I'm no bodyguard.
DOROTHEA: I'm no bodyguard.
HARRY: I'm no bodyguard.
DOROTHEA: That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
HARRY: When do you want me to start?
DOROTHEA: Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience. They love him.
HARRY: Do you? The question catches Dorothea off guard.
DOROTHEA: I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour. Tonight?
HARRY: Dorothea makes a little smile, and walks away. Harry watches her go, exhaling an appreciative breath at the sight of her departing figure.
HARRY: You're not listening to me, Loomis.
LOOMIS: The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession. Get your ass back to Mew York.
HARRY: No. I'm taking a couple of weeks' You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going I got to go. I'm late.
LOOMIS: You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going I got to go. I'm late.
HARRY: I got to go. I'm late.
LOOMIS: Call me tomorrow.
HARRY: There's other guys as good as me, Yeah. But not as cheap. Call me.
LOOMIS: Yeah. But not as cheap. Call me.
HARRY: A couple of weeks.
LOOMIS: One question.
HARRY: Who is she? Harry can't help but smile to himself.
LOOMIS: Who is she? Harry can't help but smile to himself.
LOOMIS: I thought so. 'Night, Harry. Click. Harry puts down the phone. Glances at himself in the mirror. Raises a rueful eyebrow.
DOROTHEA: I'm glad you could make it. Harry takes a seat beside her.
HARRY: Hey, this is a big deal for me. You know what seats like this cost in New York?
SWANN: Valentin emerges from the wings, patting the PANTHER that is waiting there.
SWANN: ( irritated ) I'm here.
VALENTIN: I'm here.
SWANN: The guy with Dorothea. Is that who I think it is? Valentin nods. ON SWANN, his expression unreadable.
SWANN: He's young. MUSIC strikes up. A dramatic, Wagnerian chord. Valentin hurries away. Swann's expression becomes very focused.
1ST TECHNICIAN: ( to Swann ) Swann rises up into the flies.
SWANN: Swann rises up into the flies.
1ST TECHNICIAN: How the fuck does he do that?
2ND TECHNICIAN: It's wires, man.
1ST TECHNICIAN: I never seen no wires.
2ND TECHNICIAN: ( sarcastic ) So what is it? Magic?
SWANN: My friends . come with me.into the Great Beyond. A barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt. The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly. ON HARRY and Dorothea.
HARRY: He's good.
DOROTHEA: You haven't seen anything yet.
DOROTHEA: ( a whisper ) This is the new illusion. ON STAGE, Swann is bound to a spinning WHEEL, while the DANCERS, dressed like Boschian DEMONS, cavort around him, somersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow FLAME. It's a scene from Daniels Inferno. Above him. a dozen glittering SWORDS - six feet long - are descending. He struggles to free himself. The MUSIC gets more exciting as the wheel spins faster and faster. Suddenly, a sword DROPS. It falls between Swann's outstretched legs, skewering the wheel. Then ANOTHER, close to his head. ON HARRY. He's tense. Excited. BACK TO STAGE. Swann is free I He throws off the last shackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the wheel. There's a theatrical BLAZE of white-hot SPARKS. The wheel slows. He starts to step off it, as another of the the swords DROPS. The AUDIENCE GASPS. Swann smiles, and TRIPS. As he FALLS, the sword runs through the middle of his back, carrying him down to the still-spinning wheel, and pinning him there. Some of the DANCERS continue to cavort. Some More GASPS from the audience. ON HARRY, having a FLASHBACK: Harry's hand turns over the final tar of card. The scene on the stage is that image coming to life.
HARRY: There's something wrong. ON Swann, as a second sword FALLS, skewering his thigh, and a third, running through his buttock, and a fourth and fifth, until TEN SWORDS have entered his body. ON THE AUDIENCE, not certain whether this is a trick or not. The MUSIC has stopped. In the silence, somebody GIGGLES nervously. A couple of PEOPLE break into APPLAUSE, but it dies away in a matter of moments.
DOROTHEA: No. . . ON THE STAGE, Swann raises his head and looks out at his wife, his eyes already glassy with imminent death. He reaches out towards her, and then sags on the wheel, dead. There are GASPS now from the audience. Murmurs of disgust; sobs of horror.
DOROTHEA: ( to Harry ) I've got to get to him! The AUDIENCE is rising now, as the horror of what they've seen sinks in. There is panic. A few people have fainted. One or two are even praying. Harry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea against the flood of the exiting crowd.
HARRY: Out of the way! Out of the way! He helps Dorothea onto the stage, and lifts the curtain so she can duck beneath it.
VALENTIN: ( to Stage Manager ) Get then out of here, for God's You heard him! It's not a fucking He starts to physically push the crowd back. Harry grabs his Who are you? Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE MANAGER out of Dorothea's way. She goes to Swann's body, which has been removed from the wheel.

STAGE MANAGER: Who are you? Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE MANAGER out of Dorothea's way. She goes to Swann's body, which has been removed from the wheel.
MILLER: Miller stands at an open door, leading below the stage. Butterfield enters.
DOROTHEA: ( softly ) A DOCTOR appears.
DOCTOR: I'm a doctor. Let me through. The Doctor checks Swann's body.
DOCTOR: ( to Dorothea ) I'm sorry. Harry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device. He's suspicious. He slips round to the back of the mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the cable as he goes.
HARRY: He gives chase. Loses the man in the shadows. Stops and listens for movement. Suddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of wood and smashes it into Harry's face! Harry reels back. Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his nose. Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket.
MILLER: Got you, fucker! Harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed. And now, out of the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield.
BUTTERFIELD: Who did this, D'Amour? Who killed Harry is barely holding on to consciousness.
HARRY: You did. Didn't you?
BUTTERFIELD: Why would I do that?
HARRY: Beats me. Butterfield is a foot from Harry now.
BUTTERFIELD: You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
HARRY: Deep shit? Butterfield hits him.
BUTTERFIELD: Who did this?
HARRY: I told you Butterfield hits him again.
BUTTERFIELD: Who did this?
HARRY: ( raises his hand ) All right. It was. Butterfield comes a little closer.
HARRY: ( feigning a near collapse ) . it was. Butterfield leans in. And Harry grabs him by the balls literally rising as he does so.
BUTTERFIELD: Harry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun. He FIRES once, missing Harry by inches. Harry catches hold of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon. The GUN GOES OFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW
HARRY: Deep shit.
FADE OUT: FADE IN INT. POLICE STATION - EDDISON'S OFFICE - NIGHT Harry sits at Eddison's desk, looking exhausted and bruised. Eddison has just finished taking his statement.
FADE IN: INT. POLICE STATION - EDDISON'S OFFICE - NIGHT Harry sits at Eddison's desk, looking exhausted and bruised. Eddison has just finished taking his statement.
EDDISON: And this Butterfield guy
HARRY: ( frustrated sigh ) Another fucking magician. Jesus. Harry looks past Eddison and sees an ashen, tearful Dorothea being taken into another office.
EDDISON: ( frustrated sigh ) Another fucking magician. Jesus. Harry looks past Eddison and sees an ashen, tearful Dorothea being taken into another office.
HARRY: Are you finished with me?
EDDISON: For now. Are you planning to go back to New York?
HARRY: ( watching Dorothea ) No. Not yet.
HARRY: Are they treating you okay?
DOROTHEA: ( nods ) I heard what happened. It looks like somebody murdered him.
HARRY: I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't I don't know where you'd start.
DOROTHEA: I don't know where you'd start.
HARRY: Well. how about some of the other They won't tell you anything.
DOROTHEA: They won't tell you anything.
HARRY: I can be very persuasive.
DOROTHEA: ( a beat ) Yes. I think you probably can. ( another beat ) We'd need to talk about your fee.
HARRY: Forget the fee. If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money. If I don't. .my gamble. Either way. I get to spend some time. here. The way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean L.A., it means near -Dorothea. And by the tiny smile on her face, it's also plain she knows it.
HARRY: Where'd you learn that?
WILDER: ( points ) At birth. I don't know you
HARRY: ( points ) At birth. I don't know you
WILDER: At birth. I don't know you
HARRY: Harry D'Amour.
WILDER: I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
HARRY: I'm in from New York. I came to see Swann.
WILDER: What a tragedy. It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
HARRY: Was he taking a lot of risks?
WILDER: You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
HARRY: Not the Walter Wilder? Walter beams.
WILDER: The one and only. He hands Harry a card.
WILDER: Want to try? Harry tries to emulate Wilder's card manipulation through the rest of this conversation.
WILDER: You know Vinovich?
HARRY: ( not a clue ) Sure. Vivovich.
WILDER: He knew Swann way back. He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
HARRY: I'd love to. you know. hang with some of you guys.
WILDER: People are pretty cagey. Who do you know?
HARRY: For what?
WILDER: For an introduction.
HARRY: Well. nobody. Wilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude.
WILDER: ( magnanimously ) You do now.
HARRY: I only wear ties for funerals.
WILDER: You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists. Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
HARRY: Are they all in the business?
WILDER: It's not a business. Harry. It's a Wilder points to a locked door.
WILDER: That's what they call the Repository. Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that Have you been in?
HARRY: Have you been in?
WILDER: No. There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
CUT TO: INT. MAGIC CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT Later. A drunken VINOVICH is holding court. He's in his 40's: a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy ( and fake ) middle-European accent. At the table - besides Harry and Walter - are: Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend LAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown, overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin, waspish fellow in a spangly suit: the AMAZING QUENTIN. In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.
VINOVICH: It's more than entertainment. We're opening people's heads up. Putting miracles back into their boring little lives.
BILLY: But they're fake miracles.
VINOVICH: Houdini believed he had spirit You believe that?
HARRY: You believe that?
VINOVICH: I think we walk a narrow path, between. between.
HARRY: Heaven and Hell? Vinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether he's being sarcastic or not.
VINOVICH: Trickery and divinity.
HARRY: Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
VINOVICH: No. I'm saying they were always fake. The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
HARRY: So could you walk on water?
VINOVICH: ( deadly serious ) I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
HARRY: What about Swann's miracles? The smug smile on Vinovich's face dies. Furtive glances are exchanged around the table. Only Billy Who makes a tiny They weren't worth a damn.
VINOVICH: They weren't worth a damn.
HARRY: ( goading ) I heard he was the best.
VINOVICH: If he was so good why's he so dead? Vinovich begins to look suspicious.
HARRY: You tell me. No? I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
VINOVICH: Oh, I've got plenty.
HARRY: I'd like to hear them. Vinovich rises.
VINOVICH: I'm not saying another word. You damn fool. He's a Just tell me about Swann. Or are you too scared?
HARRY: Just tell me about Swann. Or are you too scared?
VINOVICH: He was a freak. Everything he did was tainted. Harry rises. Looks straight at Vinovich, unintimidated.
HARRY: With what?
VINOVICH: Evil. He was evil. Come on. She rises.
VINOVICH: ( to the rest ) Say nothing to this man if you wish to keep my company. He stalks away. Harry calls after him, across a now- silenced bar.
HARRY: Great accent, by the way. Is it Fuck you.
VINOVICH: ( pure Brooklyn ) Fuck you.
BILLY: I gotta be careful. If Vinovich sees me talking to you. He's an asshole, but he's a powerful They go together.
HARRY: They go together.
BILLY: ( lowered voice ) I've heard a name. Someone they talk about in whispers.
HARRY: Like in nothing. Nobody. Nix.
BILLY: Like in nothing. Nobody. Nix.
HARRY: Like in nothing. Nobody. Nix.
BILLY: Like in nothing. Nobody. Nix.
HARRY: Who is he?
BILLY: I think maybe he taught Swann. This is me. See ya around. Billy hurries away.
BUTTERFIELD: Ever watched a man die? The image darkens, and fades up a beat later on Quaid.
QUAID: Please. I wasn't there. Ask Pimm's dead. Jennifer Desiderio's INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT Harry is still asleep.
BUTTERFIELD: Pimm's dead. Jennifer Desiderio's INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT Harry is still asleep.
QUAID: I'm not afraid to die. There's something terrible. coming A long silence. SUDDENLY, a telephone RINGS.
HARRY: He picks up the receiver.
HARRY: This is D'Amour.
DOROTHEA: Harry. I know it's late.
HARRY: That's okay. As he speaks, Harry scrawls Jennifer Desiderio on the title page of the Gideon's Bible beside the bed.
DOROTHEA: How did it go today?
HARRY: I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right. He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
DOROTHEA: He. didn't have me.. I told you-
HARRY: You didn't marry him for love.
DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM: She's a little uncomfortable now.
HARRY: So why did you marry him?
DOROTHEA: That's my business. Harry.
HARRY: Just curious. Back to business. Ever heard of a man called Nix? Yes. I'm here. And no. I don't know the name.
DOROTHEA: Yes. I'm here. And no. I don't know the name.
HARRY: What about Jennifer Desiderio?
DOROTHEA: It doesn't ring a bell. I have to Okay. I'll keep digging.
HARRY: Okay. I'll keep digging.
DOROTHEA: ( uneasy ) Yes. You do that. She puts down the phone, and swallows a mouthful of scotch. She's shaking. She gets up. Paces the room. Then she picks up the phone again.
HARRY: ( smiles ) In the secret compartment, some papers and an address book. He flicks to "D."
VALENTIN: Looking for you. I tried the Why'd you come here?
HARRY: Why'd you come here?
VALENTIN: You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief. Here's thirty thousand dollars.
HARRY: What for?
VALENTIN: A ticket home,
HARRY: You didn't hire me. She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
VALENTIN: She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain. Enough churning over the past. She wants it all left alone.
HARRY: Left alone? Somebody's been Yes. It's regrettable
VALENTIN: Yes. It's regrettable
HARRY: Fuck regrettable! I want to know What for? You need to stay busy?
VALENTIN: What for? You need to stay busy?
HARRY: ( a confession ) I like to know why things happen.
VALENTIN: Why people die? Give it up, D'Amour. Go home.
HARRY: Harry crosses to the door, brushing past Valentin.
VALENTIN: Don't try and see her, D'Amour. Just leave her alone. Let her He glances back at Valentin.
HARRY: Lock up, will you?
TOFFLER: Jennifer's only ever had one A Mister Quaid?
HARRY: A Mister Quaid?
TOFFLER: Right. And he's dead, isn't he? I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know. And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be I won't say anything.
HARRY: I won't say anything.
TOFFLER: Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
HARRY: What's her problem?
TOFFLER: She has no real grip on reality.
HARRY: ( a joke ) Does anybody?
TOFFLER: ( deadly serious ) Oh yes. We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
HARRY: And what does Jennifer think's They've come to french windows, which are wide open. Sitting outside in the sun is Jennifer, with her back to us.
TOFFLER: ( quietly ) Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming for her. ( louder ) Jennifer turns. She looks terrible.
JENNIFER: Have we met before?
HARRY: Only I forget. They give me pills, you know, to keep me. even. and. I forget things,
JENNIFER: Only I forget. They give me pills, you know, to keep me. even. and. I forget things,
HARRY: Well, you didn't forget me. I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
JENNIFER: Maybe. I. don't.
HARRY: What about Philip Swann?
JENNIFER: I knew Swann. He's a fucking liar. A WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes.
HARRY: Why's that?
JENNIFER: He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything. He made us think it was over and done What is?
HARRY: What is?
JENNIFER: ( tears nearing ) I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
HARRY: Ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole, laying pipes. The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but we're aware of it.
JENNIFER: I told you. I don't She stops. Looks ahead of her. Her face is suddenly ashen and clammy. Harry follows her gaze to: The hole. Somebody is in it, digging. Earth emerges in shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.
NURSE: Calm down! She delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE. The Nurse is flung He's not going to get me! She races down towards the street. Harry goes after her.
JENNIFER: He's not going to get me! She races down towards the street. Harry goes after her.
HARRY: Who's not? He catches up with her.
JENNIFER: Nix! Nix!
HARRY: Is he the Puritan?
JENNIFER: Yes! Yes!
HARRY: And he's dead?
JENNIFER: No. He's coming back. He's digging his way out! The Nurse appears behind Harry.
NURSE: I'll take care of her now. Jennifer struggles in Harry's grip.
NURSE: Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour! The Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away instantly, racing towards the street.
HARRY: She scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the top. There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of metalwork and glass. Harry gets to the wall before the Nurse. Hoists himself up onto it. Looks down.
HARRY: He slips back down the wall, and leans against it. He looks towards the hole. The Workman has stopped digging. His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from a grave. Harry closes his eyes.
HARRY: ( very quietly ) EXT. LOS ANGELES - DUSK The sun is setting, the city giving way to night.
HARRY: I want to speak to Dorothea.
HARRY: When will she be in?
DOROTHEA: Who is it? Valentin puts the phone down.
VALENTIN: Crank call. I'll get the number No word from D'Amour? Valentin shakes his head.
DOROTHEA: No word from D'Amour? Valentin shakes his head.
VALENTIN: It's better he's gone. He would have done more harm than good.
DOROTHEA: Harm to whom? Me? I don't think, so. Try him again at the hotel.
VALENTIN: I left three messages already. Dorothea nods, plainly sad at Harry's desertion. She turns and leaves the room.
HARRY: ( on phone ) Billy? It's Harry. Suppose I wanted to get into the repository at the Magic Castle?
HARRY: You've done this before.
BILLY: I've had my moments.
BILLY: I'm sure they'll have this place It'll be something hokey. CLICK! The door opens.
HARRY: It'll be something hokey. CLICK! The door opens.
BILLY: It'll be something hokey. CLICK! The door opens.
BILLY: Houdini'd been proud of you.
BILLY: ( impressed ) On the wall, plaster LIFE-MASKS. In glass cases, the tools of the great magicians: KNIVES, KEYS, GUNS, WANDS, even an IRON MAIDEN. Billy is in awe. He wanders around wide-eyed while Harry scans the shelves. The dialogue runs as they I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
BILLY: I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
HARRY: You heard right.
BILLY: You ever been married?
HARRY: Yeah. She was killed in a car crash. Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
BILLY: My life was too weird for her.
HARRY: My life was too weird for her.
BILLY: ( grinning ) I love weird. Harry has seen a small SIGIL carved onto one of the shelves.
HARRY: Billy? This was on Miller's forehead. Any idea what it is?
BILLY: Harry presses it. The entire bookcase opens up, CREAKING.
BILLY: What did I tell you? So fucking Inside, there is a small shelf. On it, FILES and PAPERS.
HARRY: What have we got here? Ever-eager, Billy steps into the recess. And two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from skewering Billy's flesh and bone! He keeps them open, his sinews straining.
HARRY: Grab the files! Billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. As he steps out of range. Harry lets go and the gates close with a
CLANG!: He slams the files down. He's trembling.
BILLY: He slams the files down. He's trembling.
BILLY: I could have lost my fucking hands.
HARRY: That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle. Which was presumably the idea. These are about Nix. Harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy.
HARRY: You go through these. Go on! Reluctantly, Billy does so. Harry picks up a faded PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE ( with the sigil painted on it ) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. There are other CULTISTS standing around. And in the DOORWAY a barely visible figure ( and all the more intimidating for that ) - is NIX.
HARRY: Wait a minute. He stares at the boy's face. The eyes are clearly different That's Butterfield.
HARRY: That's Butterfield.
BILLY: ( points to nan in ) doorway ) And who's that? ON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence. ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure.
HARRY: At a guess? The Puritan. Nix. Billy picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty. It shows a horror we recognize: a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH of another man's HEAD.
BILLY: Take a look at this.
HARRY: ( looking at it ) A Nix specialty? Billy is getting subtly spooked now. He puts the etching down and starts to go through others in the series. We glimpse them as he does so. In one, a MAN regurgitates a serpentine form made of FLAME. In another, a MAN stares at his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH. There is no bone beneath. Only a form of solid blackness. In a third, we see a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating
BILLY: I don't know any of these tricks. Harry studies the etchings.
HARRY: ( a slow burn ) Maybe they're not tricks.
BILLY: ( mystified ) I mean, there's no instructions ( realizes what Harry said ) What do you mean, they're not What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between
HARRY: What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between
BILLY: Trickery and divinity. Yeah, he says that all the time.
HARRY: That's because he knew. He'd seen these files and knew.
BILLY: Knew what? Out of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the book-stacks. Billy frowns. Harry puts his fingers to his lips. Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks. A figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed. Harry takes out his gun. Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry goes after the apparition. The TRACK is completely silent. Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy! It looks up, its face that of a psychotic: burning eyes, manic smile. It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who backs away.
BILLY: Books tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the Harry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.
BILLY: Where the fuck are you? Harry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.
HARRY: Okay. Hold it right there. The gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made of smoke. Harry waves his hands through it. It's completely ethereal. But it's still terrorizing Billy.
BILLY: ( in mortal terror ) Get it off me! Harry glances around. Sees a LIGHT flickering between some books. FIRES at it. The light goes out. The "Psycho" vanishes. Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.
HARRY: Hokey enough for you?
BILLY: I'm out of here, man! Are you Harry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file.
HARRY: I'm coming. Billy is already out of the room. For a moment. Harry pauses to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked As he does so the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the "Psycho" appears ROARING - at Harry's shoulder.
HARRY: Ah, shaddup! He FIRES at the projector a second time. On the GUN SHOT
HARRY: Thanks, Billy.
BILLY: Hey, anytime. Actually, no. This was enough. They shake, and part.
VALENTIN: ( quietly ) I can't let you in.
HARRY: ( stepping in ) Yeah, I know.
VALENTIN: You want more money, is that it? Harry pushes him aside.
HARRY: He sees candle-light through a partially open door. Starts towards it.
VALENTIN: Leave her alone
HARRY: Shut up! He pushes open the door.
DOROTHEA: This is the way he wanted it. no autopsy, no embalming. Nobody meddling with his body. Harry approaches, slowly.
DOROTHEA: Flesh is a trap. That's what he used to say. Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free. Why did you come back?
HARRY: I didn't leave. I was just digging Dorothea looks up at him.
DOROTHEA: ( uneasy ) What did you find?
HARRY: Jennifer Desiderio, for one. response ) She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon. Dorothea can't disguise her distress.
DOROTHEA: Oh Christ.
HARRY: ( a beat ) Why don't you tell me the truth?
HARRY: Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
DOROTHEA: It was more than that, I think.
HARRY: He was the real thing, right?
DOROTHEA: Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
HARRY: He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things. And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
DOROTHEA: He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things. And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
HARRY: He taught all this to Swann?
DOROTHEA: Some or it.
HARRY: So Swann was performing magic. not And what? You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making I told you
DOROTHEA: I told you
HARRY: Too much fame. Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
DOROTHEA: You said you weren't with him for I wasn't.
HARRY: You said you weren't with him for I wasn't.
DOROTHEA: I wasn't.
HARRY: What then?
DOROTHEA: I was grateful to him. I owed him my life. And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
HARRY: He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he? Dorothea is pouring herself another drink. The glass slips from her hand. It SHATTERS. Harry goes to help her. They stoop together, very close. The sexual attraction is almost palpable. Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass.
DOROTHEA: They are very close to each other.
HARRY: ( reassuring ) It's okay.
DOROTHEA: No it isn't. You can't help me.
HARRY: ( tenderly ) I'm here, aren't I? He kisses her. She kisses him back, hard.
HARRY: Nothing's going to happen to you.
DOROTHEA: ( seductive ) ( smiles ) Nothing you don't want. They kiss again, passionately.
HARRY: ( smiles ) Nothing you don't want. They kiss again, passionately.
INTERCUT: Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies of Harry and Dorothea.
DOROTHEA: ( whispers ) I was so afraid.
HARRY: Don't be. Nix can't hurt you now.
DOROTHEA: Are you sure?
HARRY: I'm sure. He's dead.
DOROTHEA: I know. I'm the one who shot ON HARRY. He's startled, to say the least.
DOROTHEA: I was twelve. Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
HARRY: ( realizing ) And they all came.
DOROTHEA: Quaid and Jennifer
HARRY: Quaid and Jennifer
DOROTHEA: And Pimm and Swann. Only Nix was ready for them. There's a NOISE downstairs.
DOROTHEA: ( nervous ) What was that?
HARRY: It's okay. Harry slips out of bed.
HARRY: Dorothea appears behind him.
DOROTHEA: Harry? Wait! Harry's at the bottom of the stairs now. Across the hall, in a passageway, an eerie SILHOUETTE. We can make out no detail of clothing or face.
HARRY: What the hell-? Suddenly, the shadowy FIGURE comes at Harry. A BLAST of ENERGY bursts against Harry's face. As it breaks against his skin, we see ( for three frames or so ) a glimpse of Harry's Harry FIRES at the figure. The shadows fold up around the Stranger like an origami puzzle. He's gone.
HARRY: ( in pain ) Harry FIRES at the figure. The shadows fold up around the Stranger like an origami puzzle. He's gone.
DOROTHEA: It's him! It's Nix! Harry goes out into the passageway.
HARRY: Valentin! Get some lights on! As if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white FIRE erupts behind Harry. He swings round to see the Stranger "unfolding" out of the shadows again, defying physics and physiology to do so. The FIRE is at his feet, like a serpent writhing on the ground. It comes at Harry. Harry FIRES at it, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's leg. He retreats, the FIRE racing after him. He makes for a door, and flings it open. He's in
HARRY: Somebody you know? Dorothea appears behind the Stranger. Sees Harry, burned and sweating, cornered against the casket.
DOROTHEA: Oh my God! The Stranger looks round. Harry snatches up the GUN, supporting his burned hand with -his good hand. Levels the gun at the Stranger. The FIRE raises its head, like a cobra.
HARRY: Which goes first? My face or your heart? The Stranger draws a deep breath. The Fire-Serpent withers and dies.
DOROTHEA: Who in God's name are you? She reaches for the Stranger, who simply folds up again; gone into darkness. The WIND blows through the house, masking his Are you all right?
DOROTHEA: Are you all right?
HARRY: Find Valentin! Find him! Get him in here! Dorothea disappears. Harry takes one of the candle-holders and jams it under the casket lid. Wood splinters. He starts to force off the lid. Valentin and Dorothea enter.
VALENTIN: What are you doing? This is He starts towards Harry. Dorothea goes after him and catches hold of his arm. Her expression is a mingling of fascination and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and Inside, Swann's corpse.
VALENTIN: Are you satisfied now?
HARRY: Harry holds Valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger into the corpse's mouth.
DOROTHEA: It's all right. It's not He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of his lower jaw. It cracks and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.
HARRY: It's all right. It's not He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of his lower jaw. It cracks and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.
HARRY: .plaster doesn't bleed. He tosses the jaw to Valentin.
HARRY: ( to Dorothea ) It looks like you're not a widow after all.
HARRY: You rigged the illusion to fail, You paid off the doctor. You set up the fake body. Yes?
VALENTIN: You paid off the doctor. You set up the fake body. Yes?
HARRY: You paid off the doctor. You set up the fake body. Yes?
VALENTIN: And then. because I was getting too close to something or someone, you called Swann
HARRY: And then. because I was getting too close to something or someone, you called Swann
VALENTIN: I tried to pay you off.
HARRY: Was that Swann's idea?
VALENTIN: No. It was mine. I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
HARRY: Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
VALENTIN: Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter? ON HARRY. He looks as though he's beginning to think maybe Nix's resurrection is plausible.
HARRY: I want to see Swann face to face.
VALENTIN: Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
DOROTHEA: What about me?
VALENTIN: Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann. A beat.
HARRY: ( to Dorothea ) Maybe Valentin's right. We should let it alone. A BELL starts to TOLL-
HARRY: ( con't. ) He went to all that trouble to be dead. Maybe we should let him stay that way. The TOLLING carries over into
1ST WORKER: Watch out! On the HEAD, as it strikes the sidewalk at somebody's feet. We don't see who.
VALENTIN: Who's there? He reaches into his jacket to draw a GUN. There's a NOISE. He swings round. Too late. Butterfield has a scalpel at his throat. He kicks Valentin to the ground.
BUTTERFIELD: ( conversationally ) I've sometimes thought, if I'd had another profession, I would have been a surgeon. On Valentin, staring up in terror. Valentin's P.O.V.- of Butterfield, upside down, above him, the scalpel glittering.
BUTTERFIELD: To be able to heal with one little On Valentin again, as Butterfield's blade touches his cheek, just beneath his eye.
VALEMTIN: No. . .
BUTTERFIELD: Let's say those eyes of yours were giving you trouble.
VALENTIN: I could scoop them out.
BUTTERFIELD: I could scoop them out.
VALENTIN: So tell me where Nix is buried.
BUTTERFIELD: So tell me where Nix is buried.
VALENTIN: I don't know. Butterfield pushes the blade into Valentin's skin. CUT WIDE, as Valentin thrashes, his face obscured by Butterfield's body.
VALENTIN: On Valentin again. There is a small cut beneath his eye, but that's all.
VALENTIN: I'll tell you.
BUTTERFIELD: You'll do more.than that.
HARRY: I knew you wouldn't be able tn stay Silence. Harry notices the beard and glasses on the operating table.
HARRY: You had to see who wept for you the A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
HARRY: A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
HARRY: Look, Ma, no wires.
SWANN: You shouldn't have followed me, How the fuck do you do that?
HARRY: How the fuck do you do that?
SWANN: Now I'm going to have to kill you.
HARRY: I don't think so. You need me Why? So you can fuck my wife? Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun.
SWANN: Why? So you can fuck my wife? Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun.
HARRY: Be careful. Funerals make me Swann stops, inches from the ground.
HARRY: You know, it's such a fucking waste. You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
SWANN: Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour. Magicians get Or murdered, like Nix.
HARRY: Or murdered, like Nix.
SWANN: He deserved it.
HARRY: Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now. That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
SWANN: I did it for Dorothea.
HARRY: Oh yeah?
SWANN: Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her. Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now they're face to face. Eye to eye. Swann, for all his posturing, is afraid.
HARRY: So Nix won't come looking for her?
SWANN: It's me betrayed him.
HARRY: And she shot him I I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
SWANN: ( despairing ) I don't know what else to do.
HARRY: Help me. On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear.
HARRY: Listen. If he's back from the dead, then he is some kind of god. And he'll find you, wherever the fuck you are. And if he's just another phony Messiah, then you can stage the greatest come-back in history. ON Swann. This doesn't sound like such a terrible idea.
SWANN: Is this the best brandy you've If that's what's on the shelves. Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air.
CASHIER: If that's what's on the shelves. Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air.
SWANN: Can you change a thousand for me?
CASHIER: ( amazed ) You're shittin' me.
HARRY: Can we go? Swann starts to COUGH. A QUARTER falls from his mouth.
HARRY: Oh Jeez.
SWANN: Will that do? No? Swann coughs again. Puts his hand to his mouth. A DELUGE of QUARTERS runs between his fingers.
SWANN: That better? The Cashier gapes.
DOROTHEA'S DREAM: A BABOON SHRIEKS, its mouth filling the frame. CUT WIDE, to reveal the Baboon, racing around Nix's Sanctum, Hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a shadowy figure. Is it Nix? We can't quite see. Black BLOOD runs from the figure and splashes on the ground. NOW WE SEE DOROTHEA, being pulled by the Cultists towards the falling gouts of dark fluid she struggles, SOBBING
DOROTHEA'S DREAM: Dorothea has a GUN in her hand. The Cultists shake it from her grip, and pull her directly under the BLOOD as it SPLASHES on her upturned face
DOROTHEA: Who's there? Silence. Then, Valentin speaks behind her. She jumps.
VALENTIN: I'm sorry. BLOOD runs from his cut face.
DOROTHEA: Jesus. Valentin. What did you do to your face?
BUTTERFIELD: Guess who we're going to see?
SWANN: You think I'm an asshole.
HARRY: Didn't know you read minds.
SWANN: ( a warning ) I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that. ( an apology ) So I like playing games with people. Gives them something to wonder about.
HARRY: Is that all?
SWANN: I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service. It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
HARRY: And you're not? Silence for a moment.
SWANN: Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe. That's why I liked Nix. He promised me all these explanations.
HARRY: And he didn't have them?
SWANN: He had something. He showed me how to bend the rules. A little levitation. A few fireworks.
HARRY: Is that all?
SWANN: ( a beat ) At the end. when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone. Jelly. And you believed him?
HARRY: And you believed him?
SWANN: I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick. No illusions. Just the truth. Are you ready for that? Harry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann.
SWANN: Harry drinks.
SWANN: Thought not.
HARRY: Now he's on the landing. Swann's below.
SWANN: She's not here. Harry spots Valentin's BLOOD on the carpet.
HARRY: Did she know where Nix was buried?
SWANN: Who else did? Did Valentin?
HARRY: Who else did? Did Valentin?
SWANN: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT Butterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of INT. BUTTERFIELD'S SEDAN - NIGHT Valentin drives. Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back.

HARRY: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT Butterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of INT. BUTTERFIELD'S SEDAN - NIGHT Valentin drives. Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back. Dorothea is handcuffed. He has a bag open at his feet. One by one he takes out a series of extraordinary instruments. Dorothea looks on,
BUTTERFIELD: Like the look of these? I made them myself, to set him free.
DOROTHEA: Why did you wait so long?
BUTTERFIELD: I didn't have the skill to resurrect him. I had to teach myself. And that took time.
DOROTHEA: And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen If he was just a man like me, then no. But he's not.
BUTTERFIELD: If he was just a man like me, then no. But he's not.
DOROTHEA: What is he?
BUTTERFIELD: Maybe he'll show you. ON DOROTHEA, terror in her eyes.
NORMAN: He will come! He will come! He will come!
BUTTERFIELD: VALENTIN ( V.0. ) Not yet. Butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly reaches out for Valentin, hauling him close.
BUTTERFIELD: If you've lied to me to me
VALENTIN: I swear. this is the place Swann told me about. The rocks. On Dorothea, who uses Butterfield's distraction to take a few steps back towards the open car door. Dorothea's P.O.V. of Butterfield, back to her, interrogating Five more minutes. Hear me? And you'd better not A SOUND behind him. Butterfield wheels round. On the ground beside the open car door, the instruments.
BUTTERFIELD: Five more minutes. Hear me? And you'd better not A SOUND behind him. Butterfield wheels round. On the ground beside the open car door, the instruments.
BUTTERFIELD: What the fuck are you playing at? He goes to pick them up. Dorothea steps from behind the door, with the sharpest in her hand. She slashes at him. Opens a WOUND across his arm.
BUTTERFIELD: He comes at her suddenly, striking the instrument from her hand, and slamming her against the car. He hits her. Once. Twice. Then
VALENTIN: ( blinded ) In the corner. The beam goes to the corner of the grave. A mummified HAND is sticking out of one of the walls.
BUTTERFIELD: ( to Valentin ) Keep away from it. Butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand. The TRACK is silent, but for Butterfield's shallow breath. He reaches out to touch Nix^s fingers. He touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a
ROAR!: He jumps back as Nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the mask rolls into view.
VALENTIN: Oh Christ! Oh Christ!
BUTTERFIELD: ( reverentially ) It's him. it's him. On Dorothea, sliding down the car in despair.
HARRY: They got here before us.
SWANN: Looks that way.
HARRY: He's in darkness now. He gets to his feet, and starts to try and scramble out.
HARRY: Swann? Swann! Suddenly, a hand is laid on his shoulder! Harry swings round. It's Valentin. He has been badly cut up.
VALENTIN: Help me. He collapses into Harry's arms.
HARRY: Help me. He collapses into Harry's arms.
VALENTIN: Help me. He collapses into Harry's arms.
HARRY: INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT Indecision is written all over Swann's face: to help or not to help?
HARRY: Give me a hand. I got Valentin. Together, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and lay him in the blaze of the headlamps.
VALENTIM: He's got Dorothea.
SWANN: And Nix?
VALENTIN: Him too.
HARRY: We've got to get you to a hospital.
VALENTIN: Don't bother.
HARRY: Shut up. We've lost enough lives I'm sorry, D'Amour.
VALENTIN: I'm sorry, D'Amour.
HARRY: What about?
VALENTIN: . Looks like you're going. to lose. one more. Valentin dies.
HARRY: ( despairing ) . no.
SWANN: He's better off this way.
HARRY: ( furious ) Nobody's better off this wav!
SWANN: You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour. He puts his foot beneath Valentin's body. It rolls back into Nix's grave.
SWANN: That's where we're all going.
HARRY: In my time, and nobody else's. ON THE EMPTY GRAVE, as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann getting into the car. The doors SLAM. The CAR LIGHTS retreat. The grave is left to DARKNESS.
BUTTERFIELD: Do you wish him to be amongst us?
CULTISTS: Will you come to him on your Be ready. Now we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands. With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the bottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up MORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor sharp pieces of GLASS. ON Butterfield, smiling. He steps back into the Sanctum.

DOROTHEA: Listen. You've got everything you want. You don't need me. .. A piece of the mask comes away from the cheek. A subtle POWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. We CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence ( on occasion her eyeball fills the screen ) as she sees these signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.
BUTTERFIELD: No, but he will. After what you did to him. He pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth.
BUTTERFIELD: He'll want vengeance. Simple PS INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT The bottle-breaking has ceased. The Cultists stand, breathless with anticipation.
BUTTERFIELD: Oh my Lord. He's coming home.
CULTISTS: He's coming home. he/s coming INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT ON Dorothea, eyes wide.
DOROTHEA: Christ in Heaven. ON Nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils. His withered flesh starts to REHYDRATE; his veins start to
BUTTERFIELD: He's with us.
CULTISTS: He's with us. He's with us.
DOROTHEA: Oh God! Butterfield looks up.
BUTTERFIELD: Hold her! On Nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face. It comes away with a moist, WRENCHING SOUND. At last, we see his eyes.
NIX: ( fury to agony ) He gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over all the lights but two. Then he strikes Butterfield to the ground, and slams his foot on Butterfield's neck, knocking him unconscious. It's a terrifying, almost demoniacal display of instant physical superiority. Throughout, he literally ROARS in rage.
HARRY: ( spooked ) Jesus. what the hell's going on in there?
SWANN: At a guess. they just resurrected Harry starts towards the house. After a beat, Swann gets out of the car and follows.
HARRY: Harry starts towards the house. After a beat, Swann gets out of the car and follows.
NIX: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT The Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction.
NIX: Will you suffer to come unto me? One by one, the Cultists fall to their knees. We never see flesh pierced by broken glass. But we HEAR IT, and see the agony on the Cultist's faces. They start to sob. Then, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.
NIX: I've come back to share the wisdom of the grave. Will you hear it?
CULTISTS: Yes. yes.
NIX: Follow me then. He steps out of the doorway. The Cultists let out sobs of adoration. Nix locks at Dorothea.
NIX: Do I know you, child? He reaches for her. Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea keeps her self-possession; but only just.
NIX: Oh yes. I do, don't I? No gun this time, child? Where's Swann?
DOROTHEA: I don't know where he is. Nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground.
NIX: He'll come. We've got unfinished business, he and I. Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the wounds he's receiving. The Cultists follow.
NIX: ( whispered to Dorothea ) Something terrible's going to happen. But if you hold on to me, very tight, you may live a little The Cultists enter the room, knees and hands BLOODY.
NIX: ( to Cultists ) Are you ready for my wisdom?
CULTISTS: Tell us. tell us.
SWANN: ( in terrified awe ) This is where we killed him.
HARRY: ( looking at table ) You didn't try hard enough.
SWANN: I can't. I can't go any Harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked grip. He crosses to the door. Suddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. He has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand. He STABS at Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs.
NIX: Here is my wisdom. He stamps on the ground. CRACKS spread from his foot in all directions. ON THE CULTISTS, amazed by this manifestation of Show us. Puritan.
BARBARA: Show us. Puritan.
NORMAN: Yes, show us!
ALL: Show us! Show us! With a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath Nix and Dorothea. Nix HOVERS over it. It's utterly dark; perhaps bottomless. Dorothea SCREAMS!
SWANN: ( to Harry ) Whatever he's doing to her, stop And Harry's up and away
NIX: ( to unseen Cultists ) You see, I escaped the grave. So I have to give something to the grave in return. On the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the bridge of his nose ( this is an image we saw in the prints in the library ), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS. As Nix REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the At first they don't realize what's going on. They think this is some kind of bizarre blessing. Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them.
NORMAN: What's happening?
NIX: I have to give something back. So I'm giving you. They're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground. They struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry for them. They are dragged down, THRASHING as they SINK.
BARBARA: ( sobbing ) Why? Why?
NIX: You're not worthy. None of you. Only Swann was worthy. You just waited like lambs. Harry appears in the doorway. Nix, still swinging round, has his back to Harry.
NIX: Well I'm not your shepherd. Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him. The ground is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up out of the dirt. The scene has a surreal beauty to it despite its horror. SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid ground. TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix and Dorothea, GUN levelled. So far, he has avoided Nix's INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle. They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was resurrected. It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann is stunned. Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments and STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of The BLADE catches him in the arm, however.
SWANN: Go on, bleed. again ) Go on! Go on! Butterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a wall. He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face!
BUTTERFIELD: Go on, bleed. again ) Go on! Go on! Butterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a wall. He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face!
BUTTERFIELD: ( screaming ) He falls backwards, his face ON FIRE. Swann doesn't wait to watch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD running from his wound.
NIX: You're not Swann. Who are you? Oh. I know what you want. He lets Dorothea slip from his arms. Harry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of Dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss. His GUN goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door leading to the passageway.
DOROTHEA: Oh God!
HARRY: Hang on! Nix reaches down to torment Harry. But before he can make Nix looks up.
NIX: There you are. Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone suddenly conversational.
NIX: I've had a lot of time to think about you. Where I went wrong. With Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the I should have been honest with you, right from the start. I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways. I was born to murder the world. ON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door. Harry glances back into the room.
SWANN: I should have been honest with you, right from the start. I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways. I was born to murder the world. ON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door. Harry glances back into the room.
NIX: I should have been honest with you, right from the start. I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways. I was born to murder the world. ON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door. Harry glances back into the room.
NIX: You could still help me do that.
SWANN: Why would I want to?
NIX: Because you've got nothing else to live for.
SWANN: Not true.
NIX: The woman has a new love in her life. Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me He lays his hands on Swann. Draws him into an embrace. ON HARRY and Dorothea.
HARRY: ( to Dorothea ) I've got to help him.
DOROTHEA: You can't.
HARRY: Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak A NOISE. He turns, and suddenly Butterfield is there! His face is horribly burned, but he's still very much alive.
BUTTERFIELD: He launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the BROKEN GLASS. A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the Nix has Swann in a bear-hug.
NIX: Will you help me? A beat. Then Swann nods.
SWANN: Nix lets him go.
NIX: You know I'll kill you when we're done. I have to.
SWANN: But until then. it's you and me. the way it always was.
NIX: But until then. it's you and me. the way it always was.
SWANN: Dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange. Swann's eyes flicker towards her. Nix turns.
NIX: Wait. you still feel something for that bitch?
SWANN: Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall, pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.
NIX: Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall, pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.
NIX: Will! You! Never! Learn!? With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them, they have the force of terrible blows. One to the ribs. They CRACK. One to the face. It BLEEDS. One to the legs, one to the arms. They all BREAK. Then Nix turns towards She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy. I'll show you! He moves towards Dorothea. Swann falls to the ground, INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.
NIX: She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy. I'll show you! He moves towards Dorothea. Swann falls to the ground, INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.
SWANN: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.
NIX: Where did she go? Nix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful. Nix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's temples. As before, there's no blood.
NIX: You've got Swann's disease. You think a little courage, a little love, and it'll all be all right. His fingers slide all the way in!
HARRY: Oh God! Harry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes are BLOOD-RED. Nix is a few yards behind him.
NIX: Tell me where she is. and I'll make it go away. Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.
HARRY: Oh God. oh God.
ON HARRY: as he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted. Reaching out for the image.
WOMAN: Help me.
ON HARRY: as he touches the wall.
HARRY: He starts to SCRATCH out the plaster on which the image is
HARRY: Dorothea! Dorothea!
ON HARRY: literally beating his head against the wall!
HARRY: No! No! No!
DOROTHEA: It's not real, Harry- Harry turns around. Dorothea is there.
DOROTHEA: Harry. Listen to me. Whatever's good between us, believe it. Harry's face is deathly white, and pouring SWEAT. He's fighting the delirium. Or doing his best.
HARRY: . oh. God.
DOROTHEA: I'm here, Harry.
HARRY: Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.
DOROTHEA: Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.
NIX: ( to Dorothea ) There you are, child. Harry starts to look round.
DOROTHEA: Don't look.
HARRY: I. have. to.
NIX: Come on, child. I want Swann to see you die. Harry turns and looks at Nix.
NIX: ( to Harry ) What are you looking at? ON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room and now slips inside. ON HARRY, staring up at Nix. ON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room. In her hand, Harry's GUN. Harry looks round at her.
HARRY: ( points to his brow ) There. there! ON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea. ON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN. She FIRES. The bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD. He sinks to his knees, BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE used to be. ON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters. He leans against the wall, shaking.
DOROTHEA: I'm okay. I'm okay. Harry opens his eyes. Looks up at her.
HARRY: I'm okay. I'm okay. Harry opens his eyes. Looks up at her.
NIX: One. last. illusion. his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of the bullet wound.
DOROTHEA: Oh my God. Harry and Dorothea start to get up. Nix is no longer human. He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS, stripped of features. He opens his mouth, the only visible element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an utterly inhuman SHRIEK!
NIX: I am the purest of the pure. I am the darkest of the dark. Harry is at the door now, starting towards Nix.
SWANN: Harry. You can't kill him. Harry crouches beside Swann.
HARRY: ( whispers ) He did something with the ground.
SWANN: Can you do it?
HARRY: Can you do it?
SWANN: I don't know.
HARRY: ON DOROTHEA. She's a couple of yards from the pit now.
HARRY: ( to Dorothea ) Get out of here! The ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging around Nix as they're all carried towards the pit. So's Harry, of course. Nix tries to get up, but he's too late. The corpses weigh him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper hold, and Harry still clings to his legs.
NIX: No! No! No! He's at the edge of the pit.
DOROTHEA: Is it finished?
HARRY: I think so. No it's not. Nix keeps falling, breaking through another layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the And now. there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below. He's approaching MAGMA.
DOROTHEA: Come on. She puts her arms around him. Kisses him, sobbing with INT. THE PIT Nix hits a layer of molten rock, and, SCREAMING, he disappears. A BURST of dark, roiling ENERGY erupts from the spot where he sank, and starts up the pit
HARRY: What the fuck?
DOROTHEA: Out! Out! They race for the front door
HARRY: Out! Out! They race for the front door
HARRY: ( quietly ) It's finished.
