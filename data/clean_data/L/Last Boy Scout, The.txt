SPORTS FIGURE (V.O.): (on TV) Eliminating the draft? Worst thing ever happened to pro football. Already you got Eric Dickerson, no team's good enough for him... You got Dion Sanders, this guy, Bosworth, bunch of peacocks. Nagurski, I saw him play for 25 bucks a game. And he woulda played for free, you get me? He loved the game. Nowadays? Forget about it.
MAN ON BED: Hello...?
MALE (V.O.): Hello, Billy.    Do you know who this is?
MALE (V.O.): Kid from Ohio is looking real good, Billie...
MAN ON BED: I'm... I'm gonna... try real hard...
MALE (V.O.): No, Billy. What you're gonna do ... is rush for 150 yards against Chicago.
MAN ON BED: That's... too much. I can't...

MILLER: (stares at him)
HALLENBECK: I know, I know, it just happened. It was an accident. Sure. You tripped. You said, 'Whoops,' and accidentally fucked my wife. Gee, Mrs. H., I'm sorry, just isn't my week. Sure, Mike. Happen to anybody. (beat) I don't gotta understand anything.
SARAH: Put the gun down.
HALLENBECK: Hmmm?  Oh, right, the gun. (sighs) You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts.
HALLENBECK: Where was Darian?
SARAH: She stayed at Cindy's last night.
HALLENBECK: Let's take a walk, Buddy.

JIMMY: Hi.   You're nobody.
HALLENBECK: Shhh.   Don't tell anyone.
JIMMY: That's what Cory said.    She said you were nobody.
HALLENBECK: Easy, Junior,   I'm not raining on your parade.    She's too young for me. I'm just    keeping an eye on her for a few   days.
JIMMY: I see. What are you, some kind of bodyguard?
HALLENBECK: Something like that. You got a cigarette?
JIMMY: No.   Is Cory in trouble?
HALLENBECK: I hope not.   You tell me.
JIMMY: She didn't mention anything to me.
HALLENBECK: Mmmm.   That bothers you, doesn't it?
HALLENBECK: (beat)
HALLENBECK: (nods)

JIMMY: (gasping)
HALLENBECK: (shrugs) (beat)
HALLENBECK: (signals the waitress) You were a great quarterback, Jimmy. I watched you play at Washington State. Red shirt freshman in '82. Followed you with the Stallions. Good scrambling ability, seventy percent completions from the pocket... You had the best gun in the N.F.L.
JIMMY: Yeah.   Thanks. I guess.
HALLENBECK: (big smile) Hell.   I'm a fan.
CORY: (giggles)
HITMAN #1: That's him.   He was with her.
HITMAN #2: Shit, he's packing. What should we do?
HITMAN #3: Get him away from here.   Then kill him.
HITMAN #2: There's no contract for him.
HITMAN #3: Then do it for free. Just do it elsewhere.
HITMAN #2: Start walking. I'm right behind you.
HALLENBECK: (the hitman loses it)
CRAG-FACE: (can't stop laughing)
CORY: (sighs)
JIMMY: Oh God. This is a hit this is a fucking hit!!
JIMMY: Cory, get out of there!!
CORY: Hey, can't you fucking drive??

HALLENBECK: (shrugs)
HALLENBECK: Yeah.   Little girl.
JIMMY: Does she like you?
HALLENBECK: Not much, no. And she likes Prince, so go figure.
JIMMY: I like Prince.
HALLENBECK: Great, you can marry my daughter. Or better yet, fuck my wife. I hear all it takes is a credit card and two valid I.D.'s. (beat) Open the trunk.
JIMMY: (indicating bomb) You're just gonna stick that in your trunk?
HALLENBECK: (nods) You're right. Let's leave it here for the neighborhood kids to play with.
VOICE (O.S.): Hold it right there, gentlemen.
JIMMY: Is it the cops?
HALLENBECK: No, Jimmy.   It's not the cops.
TALL MAN: (beat)
HALLENBECK: (to Jimmy)
HALLENBECK: (shakes his head)
HALLENBECK: (gasping)
TALL MAN: (smiles)
HALLENBECK: (spits out blood)
TALL MAN: (shrugs)
TALL MAN: (to Hallenbeck)
JIMMY: Jesus fucking Christ!
HALLENBECK: Even when he came out of it, he was never right in the head. His dad fixed everything with the cops. The accident report disappeared. A week later the police found half a kilo of crack cocaine planted in my house. Acting on an anonymous tip.
JIMMY: The senator fucked your job.
HALLENBECK: And my pension. And my marriage. Only reason I'm still licensed to carry a gun, the man himself made a few calls. Since then I'm just playing it out. Day by day.
JIMMY: Cory tumbled to some sort of deal between Marcon and the senator, and they had her killed. (beat) We gotta show this photo to the cops.
HALLENBECK: Not yet. I need more evidence. (beat) I want Baynard, Jimmy. I want to bring him down. I could use your help.
JIMMY: Why should I help you?
HALLENBECK: Because if Baynard takes a fall, so does Marcon. The man who kicked you out of professional football.
MILO: (beat)
GIRL: Oh God Milo please oh God oh no please Miloooo!!
MILO: Easy, Pablo.   She's not a piece of meat.
MILO: Yes, Mr. Marcon? How can I help you?
MARCON (V.O.): Is this line secure?
MILO: One hundred percent, sir. I wouldn't have used your name otherwise.
MARCON (V.O.): Sid and Jake are dead, Milo. Killed in an explosion. Looks like we got a new player in the game.
MILO: Who is he working for?
MARCON (V.O.): From available information, he appears to be a free agent. Guy by the name of Joe Hallenbeck.
HALLENBECK: (notices Darian)
HALLENBECK: (incredulous) (to Darian)

(MORE): This little guy who only got seventeen minutes, who was he, Joe...? What was he like? (beat) What would he have been?
HALLENBECK: He would have been a great ball player. Like his dad.
JIMMY: (shakes his head) No. He had to die, Joe.     Don't you see?
HALLENBECK: Why did he have to die?
JIMMY: (softly) Because he came out of me.
JIMMY: I'm gonna borrow your shower.
HALLENBECK: Not in my house, you dumb motherfucker.

MARCON: (nods)
MARCON: (smiles) Just one.
MARCON: Sit down, Joe.
SARAH: Do what he says, Joe.
HALLENBECK: Are you alright, Sarah?
SARAH: Yes.
MILO: That's a temporary condition, Joseph. As you may be aware, there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave snuff films. And unless you do every fucking thing Mr. Marcon tells you... your wife will make her motion picture debut.
BESSALO: (beat)
JIMMY: (beat)
HALLENBECK: (weakly)
HALLENBECK: Don't... look at me...
SARAH: Shhh. It's okay, Joe. I'm here, it's okay. (strokes his hair) I love you, Joe.
HALLENBECK: I get the shit beat out of me... puke all over myself... and now you love me?
SARAH: I never stopped loving you, Joe.
HALLENBECK: Christ, you slept with three guys.
SARAH: You knew about the others?
HALLENBECK: I knew.
SARAH: You never said anything.
HALLENBECK: Figured... you needed them.
SARAH: Joe, Goddammit, why didn't you say something?
HALLENBECK: Like what?   'Fuck you, Sarah'?
SARAH: Yes. Fuck you, Sarah! Anything to show that you... that you had some pride left.
MILO: Careful, Pablo. We don't want to get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby.
MILO: Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time to go, and remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the price.
HALLENBECK: You're gonna kill us both anyway.
MILO: Perhaps. But there are ways to die, and then there are... ways to die. Capisce? You determine your wife's fate.
SARAH: Joe...!
MILO: You're wasting my time, Joseph. Let's go.
HALLENBECK: If you touch me again... I'll kill you.
JIMMY: I need to borrow a gun, Henry.
MARCON: Marcon.
MARCON: (sighs)

DARIAN: Do you hear that -- ?
JIMMY: Holy fucking shit!
PILOT: Code yellow, code yellow, we got a bogie, repeat, we got a bogie, over.
MILO: Air One, Air One, where the fuck is he?
PILOT (V.O.): Nine o'clock, repeat, on your nine, and closing fast!
JIMMY: Oh, wow.    We're fucked.
MAN: Shit!   Something's going on.
BAYNARD: What is it?
MAN: Another boat.    It's a fucking setup!
BAYNARD: Get us out of here, now!
MILO: Who the fuck is he?
CREWMAN: Son of a bitch! It's Dix, the Goddamn quarterback!
CREWMAN (O.S.): There's a little girl with him!
MILO: Air One, Air One, follow the Senator, roger? I'll take the sport boat, you take Baynard, over.
AIR ONE (V.O.): That's a roger. Over and out.
MILO: (turns to his men) Okay, let's go. Full throttle.
HALLENBECK: (beat)
HALLENBECK: (nods)
DARIAN: (crying)
HALLENBECK: (hands her a twenty) (beat)
JIMMY: (clears his throat) Oh, I forgot to tell you. The police want you for killing Mike Miller.

MARCON: (softly)
HALLENBECK: Jimmy, you okay...?
JIMMY: Hurts like hell.
HALLENBECK: Okay, Connie, you're gonna walk us out of here, nice and easy, got it? (beat) Can you walk, Jimmy?
JIMMY: Yeah... I think so -- Joe, behind you...!
STRANGE MAN: Drop it.
HALLENBECK: You drop it, asshole, or I kill Marcon.
STRANGE MAN: Sorry, but that won't work. I don't care if he lives or dies, now drop the gun.
STRANGE MAN: Walk over there by your friend, Joe.
BAYNARD: (turns)

JIMMY: I'm new at this, Joe.   How do we do it?
HALLENBECK: We get in, we get out. Shoot anyone who's not my wife. Check that: Don't shoot me.
HALLENBECK: Cut.
HALLENBECK: Jimmy should be here any minute. Then we gotta talk to the cops.
SARAH: Will the police catch Marcon?
HALLENBECK: Maybe. He's probably in some secret crash pad, packing to leave town.
SARAH: I remember when we got married... My friends would talk about their husbands. They'd say, 'Oh, my husband is a big-time publisher,' or, 'My husband is a brilliant lawyer...' I used to say, 'My husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking.'
HALLENBECK: Don't knock it. It's a skill.
SARAH: I want to try, Joe.   Do you still want to try?
HALLENBECK: Ahh, shit. Looks like the local constable has come to chat.
SARAH: Shall we invite him in?
HALLENBECK: No.   Stay here. I'll deal with it.
MILO: You fucked up my face, Joseph!
MILO: Don't try to hide, Joseph. I've got all night, you fucked up my face.
