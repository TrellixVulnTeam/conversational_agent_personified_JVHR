LARRY CROWNE: Written by Tom Hanks From a story by Tom Hanks & Nia Vardalos
FADE IN: Big and orange and full of hope, as sure as fate. A dawn as promising as, well, this new day. Sun is rising over. A flat roof that stretches to the horizon. A vast expanse. A plain of gravel-embedded tar, studded with. HVAC units and power lines, the kind that service a huge commercial building. In fact this kind of building. A UNIMART store. A flagship of savings; a mother lode of low, low prices. 100,000-and-then-some square feet of the Consumer Economy.
SUNRISE: Big and orange and full of hope, as sure as fate. A dawn as promising as, well, this new day. Sun is rising over. A flat roof that stretches to the horizon. A vast expanse. A plain of gravel-embedded tar, studded with. HVAC units and power lines, the kind that service a huge commercial building. In fact this kind of building. A UNIMART store. A flagship of savings; a mother lode of low, low prices. 100,000-and-then-some square feet of the Consumer Economy.
PARKING LOT: Empty thus far. A few EMPLOYEE autos arriving in their assigned slots far from the entrance. One of those cars is a old, not so vintage nor classic convertible. KARMANN GHIA Belonging to. LARRY CROWNE - A man as reliable ( and predictable ) as that rising sun. Actually, he's a Team Leader of this Unimart, dressed in his un-sexy, un-fashionable, un-flattering khaki pants and Company Polo. Larry has had the ragtop down. He wrestles it up, locks the cover into place. He doesn't just walk to work, but s t r i d e s across the asphalt field like a Sultan of Sales; a Viscount of Discount. He cheers co-workers at the start of the day, shouting encouragement, flashing thumbs up, knocking on car doors and squeezing shoulders.

LATER: That same up-chucking baby was riding on the coin-pony and up- chucked again. Larry is cleaning it all up. A beat-up CAR with a BIG STORK PIZZA sign stuck on its roof pulls right up to the front of the store, parking in the Handicapped Space.
LARRY CROWNE: Buddy. Park there and you'll get a Call a cop, doof. I'm gone in sixty seconds. ( a dozen pizza boxes ) You guys having a party?

HURLEY: "R-Bomb"? Oh my god! Restructuring?

STRANG: Who else? Avery won't retire. We fire him, it's a law suit. AVERY - Old. Black. Happy.
COX: What Salary Tier is Crowne at?
ANDREWS: Top of the pyramid with a C.O.L. bump at the first of the year.

COX: Let's call it. Today, end of shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu. LARRY is dancing up a storm.
VASQUEZ: LC Why still here?
LARRY CROWNE: Team Leaders zone departments before punching out. It's policy.
VASQUEZ: I mean here here. You just got paged to Meeting Room 2. The P.A. blares again. Now they can hear it sort of.
LARRY CROWNE: Probably to clean up after the Isn't it Employee of the Month Day? Larry brightens. That is what it must be.

VASQUEZ: You're the only one around here who deserves it. How many will this Ah, who's counting? He flashes his fingers: twenty two!
LARRY CROWNE: Ah, who's counting? He flashes his fingers: twenty two!
LARRY CROWNE: Remember how we saw "The UniMart Way" video, Vick? You and me, alone in this room, and look at us Hurley has a frozen face. Larry looks at Andrews' smile.
STRANG: Cubby. Make tracks. The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves
LARRY CROWNE: I think I know what this is about.
STRANG: I don't think you do.
COX: Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So we take care. Which makes moments like these tough for all of us.
LARRY CROWNE: Sounds like you're firing me. Larry is joking.
STRANG: I take it back.
COX: Corporate has mandated a restructuring in all UniMart stores. That's the word they use. I call it a pain in the touchas.
HURLEY: Yeah. A yiddish word.
ANDREWS: Like the buttocks.
HURLEY: Touchas and buttocks. Synonymous.
COX: Hurts to get kicked back there, no matter what language you speak. Larry now gets it.
LARRY CROWNE: UniMart is firing me.
STRANG: Crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job.
LARRY CROWNE: Why me?
ANDREWS: Who do you suggest? Alvarez? Avery? I don't think so.
LARRY CROWNE: Why not Strang? Strang snorts.
HURLEY: Seniority would preclude this reality, Larry, but UniMart's policy is to never limit your Larry Crowne has no idea what that means.
COX: Here's the prob: your lack of a graduate degree will forever retard any move up the management ladder.
STRANG: Becasue you never went to college you're forever retarded.
LARRY CROWNE: I won't make the Front Office?
STRANG: ( shows his college ring ) S. M. U. Class of '86! Go 'Stangs! It's true.

KNEE: LARRY CROWNE
LARRY CROWNE: Thanks for seeing me off.
VASQUEZ: I need your apron, man.

LARRY CROWNE: I was holding for Barry Raphael in Home and Real Estate?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD: Mr. Raphael is no longer with the bank. How can I help you?

GPS VOICE: Please Enter your destination.
MERCEDES TAINOT: I'm here. Shut up. Turn off! Stepping from her sub-compact, she struggles into a pair of heels, as in this state she drives barefoot. If only her huge Thermo-cup held a hair of the dog she might not walk such a crooked mile from the parking lot to the campus. Larry in his car screeches around a corner. He is frantically looking for a place to park, but as this is the first day of term, the lot is jammed! He nearly hits Mercedes Tainot.
LARRY CROWNE: Sorry! Parking's impossible today!
MERCEDES TAINOT: Are you new to the Faculty?
LARRY CROWNE: New to the Student Body.
MERCEDES TAINOT: This is the Faculty Lot. We've earned degrees for these spaces. Students park on Mars.
LARRY CROWNE: I'm going to be late for my first day of school.
MERCEDES TAINOT: I bet it won't be the first time.
MERCEDES TAINOT: This is it?
LARRY CROWNE: Please tell me this is Speech 217. Mercedes drops her bag on her desk. She is crushed and hates Larry Crowne. She takes up some chalk, turns to the board, then writes in large, shaky-yet-feminine script:
MERCEDES TAINOT: While earning a Masters in Shakespearean Political Discourse from Vassar, I learned to care. Caring is a prerequisite for this class I have to teach in this
DIBIASI: Ms. Tie-knot? Ms. Tainot glares at Dibiasi. Glares and glares at him.

PINEDO: LARRY CROWNE
LARRY CROWNE: I woke up this morning so nervous about the first day of school. I changed my clothes three times. We may have noticed TALIA FRANCESCO - a very stylish young student - come in and sit nearby. No notebook or anything.

PATIENCE: Your next wife might stand smoking that pipe in the house but your first one says 'uh-uh!' On the old TV on "Wheel of Fortune" ( A person ).
LAMARR: Passing through, woman. Lamarr goes through the patio doors to the back yard, a space filled with even more yard sale items.
PATIENCE: Larry Crowne, been thinking about you. Sit down here. Larry watches Vanna White turn letters - he solves the "College Graduate."
LARRY CROWNE: "College Graduate."
PATIENCE: That's going to be you someday. She's pulled up some LP's on eBay on the computer.
LAMARR: This what you're talking about?
LARRY CROWNE: That's a hunk of junk.

LARRY CROWNE: Gotta go!
TALIA: Then get going!! Talia watches him go. Likes him thus far.

MERCEDES TAINOT: We now all know how to Burpie. Thank you.
LARRY CROWNE: You mean me?
MERCEDES TAINOT: Mr. Crowne. My bad. Larry goes to the podium - armed with a huge stack of 3x5's. Busik shoots him a 'thumbs up.' He looks at Mercedes for the starting cue.
LARRY CROWNE: My presentation will be on the subject of a very particular procedure. "How to make French Toast", but I'll speak English. Larry has used up one card. Mercedes rolls her eyes and talks to herself in a MOVIE DEVICE way.
MERCEDES TAINOT: M classes were once filled with e rnest young men ready to learn all I had to teach them. Cute boys fresh out of High School who all had crushes on me from day one. Now look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound for jail. Mack. Treating college like another tour of combat. Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd be Osric in Act 5. The part that is always cut.

MERCEDES TAINOT: You want to make out with me, you can. I know I'm not a third rate Audrey Hepburn wanna-be but I still
GOT MOVES: Come on, Gramps. Take this ride.
LARRY CROWNE: MERCEDES TAINOT LARRY CROWNE
MERCEDES TAINOT: Pretty dang good. I still got it, Yes, you do..
LARRY CROWNE: Yes, you do..
MERCEDES TAINOT: Whoever I am.
DEAN TAINOT: Oh, Jesus Hell and tomorrow.
LARRY CROWNE: On his scooter. Heading towards the Scooter parking. She smiles a rare thing on a morning like this but the memory of last night warrants it. She heads in that EXT. E.C.C.C. CAMPUS - SAME Mercy is trying to 'accidentally' run into Larry, but is caught by surprise when.. He is walking right towards her. Oops. That would be uncomfortable. She DUCKS behind a pillar. Still wanting to 'bump' into the man who kissed her last night, she circumvents his path, stalking Larry like a birdwatcher tracks a blue-tailed swallow. Hopping behind a tree, Mercy's SHOE gets caught in some mud. Bending down, a branch catches her sweater and RIPS a seam. Stepping onto the pavement, the tree branch SMACKS her in the Still, she keeps and eye on Larry. And pursues.
BENCH AREA: Staying out of his eye line, Mercy navigates her way around to the other side of the Bench Area and preps her appearance before making a 180 degree reverse, guaranteeing a 'Meet' with Larry. Then she sees her.
TALIA: Sitting with others, greeting Larry with laughter and hugs and hoots. Talia is announcing to all how she left Larry with a drunken teacher last night, with her arm around his waist and affection in her eyes.
MERCY: Is crushed. For the obvious reasons sh s ill can't understand. She was hoping to have Larry to herself for a minute or two.
TALIA: Oh, come on! I left you all set up! What went down?
LARRY CROWNE: Epilog. School today.
TALIA: Lance! A Betty on your Scooter after midnight? Holding on, her arms around you, pressed against your back, is a license to at least cop a feel.
LARRY CROWNE: If we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it. Talia slugs him. All in play.
MERCY: Convinced Larry is gossiping about last night, Mercy backs away from the scene, and slinks away toward her class.
PINEDO: Seeing them the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis should have been beyond me, but I was a little girl in Coach class still awake, a window seat, a moonless night somewhere over Greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald, gossamer light dancing just for me.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Mr. Crowne? A moment please?
CALIMERIS: Why doesn't she just throw herself at him?
PINEDO: This is bordering on harassment Quiet down. I'm watching the TV Why doesn't this ever happen to me?
DIBIASI: Quiet down. I'm watching the TV Why doesn't this ever happen to me?
MACK: Why doesn't this ever happen to me?
MERCEDES TAINOT: I need a few moments alone with Mr. Crowne thank you.
DIBIASI: Move along folks. Privacy's a right in this great nation of ours.
MACK: You want I should close this door, lock it, and barricade it so you won't be disturbed?? We hear them cackling like geese in the hall.
LARRY CROWNE: How are the Triplets? Groggy, Puffy, and Grumpy. He means the hangover.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short a time span.
LARRY CROWNE: Last i ht? Let's see, what was I doing? Studying some. Working some. Can't recall. I've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can.
MERCEDES TAINOT: I had no right to judge you or your relationships. Date who you want. Larry has no idea what that means.
LARRY CROWNE: I wouldn't want that.
MERCEDES TAINOT: happened before.
LARRY CROWNE: Sure. Nothing happened. At all.
MERCEDES TAINOT: So there will be no bravado among you and your pals?
LARRY CROWNE: MERCEDES TAINOT
MERCEDES TAINOT: Thank you, Mr. Crowne.
LARRY CROWNE: I'd better scurry along to Dr. Matsutani's class. I hope I don't have this same conversation with Larry leaves - a good mood ruined. Mercy watches him go. What is going on behind those dark EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - AFTERNOON Larry and Lamarr are sitting on the curb, watching kids play down the street. They run back and forth in front of them with a soccer ball. They both have pipes, with Lamarr showing him how to light Puff. Don't suck. Then. relax.
LAMARR: Puff. Don't suck. Then. relax.
LARRY CROWNE: I have to sell my car. Put a new top on it.
LARRY CROWNE: If I could afford a new top I could afford to keep it.
LAMARR: What's the job paying you?
LARRY CROWNE: Half my UniMart salary.
LAMARR: You're down, Larry Crowne. Down as I'm looking back on the year Denise left as the good old days.
LARRY CROWNE: I'm looking back on the year Denise left as the good old days.
LAMARR: Hang in there, neighbor.
LARRY CROWNE: Everyone keeps saying that.
LAMARR: I was in the same spot. Look what The odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery.
LARRY CROWNE: The odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery.
LAMARR: I read how the universe is expanding, Larry, taking us along with it. That is a wild concept to grasp, but what it means is, we all have to hold on tight sometimes to get to where we're going to be.
LARRY CROWNE: ( THE PIPE )
LAMARR: Keep your grip. You'll be okay. It's like the wife always says. Shoppers pull up to Lamarr's Yard Sale. The WIFE has a
AISLE: No one is there to help Larry pick out two 'For Sale by Owner' signs. And, he can't help it: he straightens out some messed up racks and shelves.
REGISTER: Vasquez - Security - is gone, replaced by Cubby the former Janitor who is now the skinniest SECURITY GUARD in history. Larry slides the signs for purchase. Manning the thing? Vicky Hurley. Not looking good
HURLEY: ' ind bargains today?'
LARRY CROWNE: Vick? How you doing? Larry Hurley looks at him. She looks tired. And stupid in her Cashier's Apron.
HURLEY: Larry. Hi.
LARRY CROWNE: Why are you on the Register?
HURLEY: Management Execs are now required to put in 8-hour shifts on the floor. Every day. No overtime. No bonus. Just more hours. Cash or UniMart Bargain Card? Like you have one of them.
LARRY CROWNE: Cash. No receipt. Hurley is robotic.
HURLEY: You got out of here just in time. 'Thank you for choosing UniMart, where united we blah blah.'
DEAN TAINOT: MERCEDES TAINOT
MERCEDES TAINOT: Thanks for coming.
DEAN TAINOT: No notice. No preamble. Just an email and a google map.
MERCEDES TAINOT: I knew you'd be on the computer.
DEAN TAINOT: Point made.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Are we making a mistake here?
DEAN TAINOT: MERCEDES TAINOT
MERCEDES TAINOT: Point made. We could change things. We could start right now.
DEAN TAINOT: We could. Why should we?
MERCEDES TAINOT: Because we have history, Dean. But first, my thoughts. I've got to address drinking. I should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations. And the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure.
DEAN TAINOT: I'd like that too.
MERCEDES TAINOT: DEAN TAINOT
DEAN TAINOT: You're not a pleasant woman after a few glasses. Mornings with you are to be survived.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Okay. Now, you. Dean is caught short.
DEAN TAINOT: I see. I'm what this is all about.
MERCEDES TAINOT: There are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start You're talking about you but you really mean me.
DEAN TAINOT: You're talking about you but you really mean me.
MERCEDES TAINOT: I'm not saying that.
DEAN TAINOT: We've both been here before. Why prolong the process? White flag! I give up. This ain't working.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Here I have surprise topics. Friday, in a Lightning Round, you must wax on that topic for 2 minutes without pause, repetition, or lack of charm. No notes. One visual aid.
MS. PINEDO: MERCEDES TAINOT
MERCEDES TAINOT: Spuds. Can't wait. Dibiasi draws a paper.
DIBIASI: 'Disraeli'? What is that?
MERCEDES TAINOT: Who is that?
DIBIASI: It's a guy from Disrael. I'm done. Now it's Larry's turn. He shyly draws a paper a bit uncomfortable in class since the recent events.
LARRY CROWNE: MERCEDES TAINOT
MERCEDES TAINOT: That's supposed to say 'Communism.'
LARRY CROWNE: The handwriting is loopy. Looks like 'Consumerism'.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Fine. 2 minutes on Consumerism. Calimeris picks. Hers is loopy, too.
CALIMERIS: 'Malpity Hoople.'
MERCEDES TAINOT: No idea. Just pick another.
DR. MATSUTANI: ( HIS BOOK ) )
TALIA: You digging what you see?
LARRY CROWNE: You missed Matsutani's class. Review for the final.
TALIA: I'm done w th college.
LARRY CROWNE: What? Why?

LARRY CROWNE: Talia. Don't be a fool. Stay in school. Don't throw away your And don't drink and drive or do drugs and quit smoking and eat vegetables. I don't. I stopped. I did. I do.

LARRY CROWNE: Pretty much. Oh, look. Maurice gave us free tattoos. I wanted something in Japanese so check this She shows it to him, just above her butt-crack. It's two Japanese characters.
TALIA: Pretty much. Oh, look. Maurice gave us free tattoos. I wanted something in Japanese so check this She shows it to him, just above her butt-crack. It's two Japanese characters.
LARRY CROWNE: Japanese characters go the other way and that says Soy Sauce.
TALIA: Oh shut up.
LARRY CROWNE: It does. Soy sauce. Soy. Sauce. Quitting school is for dopes. It does, actually say Soy Sauce. He is starting his scooter.
TALIA: Be here for our Grand Opening!
LARRY CROWNE: Might not make it. I have finals!
OPEN SKY: Larry comes into frame, with a hammer and stake.
MERCEDES TAINOT: As long as alcohol's out of my They have good pie, they say.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Great. Sugar can replace tequila in my bloodstream, my thighs, and the folds in my neck. They pass a car prominently parked - Larry's Convertible Karmann Ghia with a sign on its windshield: "FOR SALE BY
OWNER.": FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH ( PRE-LAP ) So. You're a mess.
MERCEDES TAINOT: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
PERRY: Ladies. Bring an appetite?
PERRY: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
PERRY: Cream pies I got.
PERRY: Boston Cream? Key Lime? Lady, you're killing me here.
PERRY: MERCEDES TAINOT
MERCEDES TAINOT: I'll have the French Toast.
MERCEDES TAINOT: ( on the menu ) Breakfast all day. Perry leaves to put in the order.
MERCEDES TAINOT: I kissed a boy.
MERCEDES TAINOT: One of my students.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Older than me.
MERCEDES TAINOT: He sort of. rescued me. And. he smelled nice.
MERCEDES TAINOT: I wanted to be kissed so asked if he wanted to and he did.
KITCHEN: Perry slides over a plate of French Toast with one bite out of it. Larry looks up from his Econ. 1 Textbook.
PERRY: You're slipping, Larry.
LARRY CROWNE: She's insane.
PERRY: Take it up with her. Larry heads out of the kitchen.
BOOTH: Here comes Larry, not yet seeing Mercedes.
LARRY CROWNE: Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a problem with your order?
MERCEDES TAINOT: Knock Larry over with a feather.
LARRY CROWNE: Mrs. Tainot.
MERCEDES TAINOT: This is Larry Crowne.
LARRY CROWNE: There's no way in creation I screw up French Toast.
MERCEDES TAINOT: It was fine, actually.
LARRY CROWNE: You'll be the judge of that. The is a beat of silence.
MERCEDES TAINOT: LARRY CROWNE
LARRY CROWNE: Would you let my boss know so I don't lose this job?
MERCEDES TAINOT: Yes indeed.
LARRY CROWNE: Shall I prepare you another batch?
MERCEDES TAINOT: No. Thanks.
LARRY CROWNE: Then I will return to my station.. Mercedes watches him go.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Look at the men in my life.
MERCEDES TAINOT: That's my problem. I'm a drunken KITCHEN FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH That ends. right now.
KITCHEN: The cupboard is open. Where there was once booze go coffees and teas. MUSIC is playing as these girlfriends reconstruct Mercy's EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT The street is empty. Larry is on his scooter, riding around and around and around the block that he will soon leave. He can see his NEIGHBORS through the open windows KIDS bouncing on a couch.A QUARTET OF OLD FOLKS playing cards and laughing. a MOVIE playing on a big TV. This was Larry's street.
SUNRISE: EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - MORNING Mercedes exits the door, crisp, clean like we've never seen her in the mornings. See the way she holds, not clutches, her Thermo-Cup?
MERCEDES TAINOT: What a difference from day one. I must be a better teacher than I Dibiasi is nailing it. Calimeris stopped up-talking. Lala you can't shut up. Mack spoke about Australia for three minutes and mentioned kangaroos only twice. And Larry Crowne. Larry is listening to Dibiasi, wearing what was once his UniMart polo, with his nametag and everything. Compared to the man he is now, that polo looks out of place..
DIBIASI: Nothing. And I was just wrapping up here.
MERCEDES TAINOT: I'm so sorry. Please go on.
DIBIASI: Larry? It okay if I get to my climax and denouement? Larry nods.
PINEDO: Not so much as a bump, Nomad! Why'd you go last?
DIBIASI: Fourth quarter dramatics.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Congratulations all of you.
MACK: Who's the MVP, Mrs. Tainot? Can we Not me, I have to stay objective.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Not me, I have to stay objective.
MACK: I say. Lala! They all say Lala! It's unanimous! They start chanting her name. "La la! La la! La la!" embarrassing her. Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding. It's a spontaneous party that Mercedes has to back out of. As she leaves, she looks back long enough to see Larry Crowne leading a parade around the room.
DR. MATSUTANI: The first to finish. No surprise. Dr. Matsutani hands Larry his confiscated phone. Larry INT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - KITCHEN The final utensils are going into a box. Larry is doing this part himself. He sits for a moment in the breakfast nook surveying his kitchen, what was once his. Mack comes in with a box of his LP's.
MACK: This is the last of them. Damn, you have a lot of records.
LARRY CROWNE: Priceless at a buck apiece.
PATIENCE: A two-bedroom apartment and you don't have room for your furniture?
LAMARR: Selling this futon-sofabed? All those years across the street and you've learned nothing.
LARRY CROWNE: You'll get me top price.
LAMARR: You did learn.
DIBIASI: Pizza at last!
LARRY CROWNE: Here's lunch as promised! The BIG STORK PIZZA GUY pulls up in a different car but the same sign.
STRANG: Son of a cock. Larry Crowne. The Pizza guy is none other than Jack Strang.
LARRY CROWNE: Jack Strang. Wow. This is irony.
STRANG: Two extra large. One Salad Bucket. Box of Frosty Cinnamon Eggs. Sixteen- Larry hands him the coupon and a Twenty.
LARRY CROWNE: Jack. I need two bucks back. Times are tough.
STRANG: Tell me about it.
LARRY CROWNE: Ah. Forget it. Keep the change. Strang leaves. Larry watches him go. him. It almost was.
STRANG: I appreciate it. That could have been
RAUL: My next wife just walked in. Perry looks.
PERRY: I love this business sometimes.
KITCHEN: Larry is arranging his station.
PERRY: Larry, your Speech 217 teacher has a question about the menu. Larry can see her. She looks gorgeous.
RAUL: Go ahead. I'll take the window even though I'm the boss of the whole kitchen.
MERCEDES TAINOT: There's Larry Crowne. Are you allowed to sit?
LARRY CROWNE: I add chicory and a bit of vanilla. Trick I picked up in the Navy.
MERCEDES TAINOT: You're probably wondering why I stopped by. Well, it's to tell you your grade for Speech 217. You killed on the final and have an A. Way to go! She offers him a Terrorist Fist Bump. With the hand that no longer has a wedding ring on it.
LARRY CROWNE: Didn't expect that. Thanks, Mrs. Class is out. Call me Mercedes. Or Mercy, for short.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Class is out. Call me Mercedes. Or Mercy, for short.
LARRY CROWNE: MERCEDES TAINOT
MERCEDES TAINOT: No. I meant the. never mind.
LARRY CROWNE: This has turned into a full time gig. Out of necessity.
MERCEDES TAINOT: I hope you continue your education. Back at East City. You've made such a good start.
LARRY CROWNE: I'll have to see.
MERCEDES TAINOT: I got Speech 217 moved to 10 AM, thank God. Who knows what I'll hear with the extra sleep.
LARRY CROWNE: My first class in college ever. And I get an A. Gotta be the They look at each other.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Should get going.
LARRY CROWNE: Cars not much. Devices some. They rise.
GPS VOICE: Please enter your destination.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Oh be quiet. That's a MapGenie.
MERCEDES TAINOT: It is Hellspawn.
LARRY CROWNE: In my old job, I'd have steered you to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie interface is clumsy and the menu needs too many inputs. He is reaching into the car, across her to tap the unit.
MERCEDES TAINOT: It was working fine. Then I think I pressed too many buttons.
LARRY CROWNE: Ah. The Auto On Feature is engaged. Menu. Select. Features. Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes. On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back. Back. Back. Exit. While he was doing that, Mercedes was smelling what she could of Larry. She liked it. She looked at his neck, his ears. And smelled him.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Seemed like years and years.
LARRY CROWNE: All better now. Should be able to find your way. Nothing to do now but say goodbye. They hear a pounding. Raul is at the window inside the cafe, signaling the break is LARRY CROWNE ( CONT'D ) My Boss. Back to work.
PERRY: Kimosabe, holding off til after school to woo the teacher is the move of a class act. Larry turns to watch Mercedes drive away.
DIBIASI: ( on his phone ) I gotta get off, Baby, or I'm in hot water with Professor Tai-bo. Mercy does a Shakespearean dance of joy.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Is Larry with you?
CALIMERIS: Um, no. Should we track him down and drag him in here? Mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment.
MERCEDES TAINOT: I. Seeing you all. I just Choose a seat and lets get started! The four smile at each other.
PINEDO: Carrying a torch for Larry til it burns her hands.
BUSIK: All the excitement of first day of term, I don't want to go back to my empty apartment. Do you? I need a drink and some talk and some wind- down time. Don't you?
MERCEDES TAINOT: Dr. M.
DR. MATSUTANI: Larry Crowne is taking six units from me, devouring the material like a starving man.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Larry's enrolled?
DR. MATSUTANI: He's continuing his education and tells me it is because of you. That your class changed his life. Mercedes finds herself smiling beaming.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Larry said that about me?
BUSIK: Oh yeah! I put that guy in your class. So technically, I changed his life.
MERCEDES TAINOT: He is a good student
DR. MATSUTANI: And handy on a scooter.
MERCEDES TAINOT: Well, no. No offense Dr. M.
DR. MATSUTANI: The rumor is you are newly single and I was just taking a shot. Mercy looks right at Busik.
MERCEDES TAINOT: News travels fast. Busik pretends he knows nothing.
BUSIK: If you're going out, I'm not doing DR. MATSUTANI Have you ever been to Hooters?
DR. MATSUTANI: Have you ever been to Hooters?
BUSIK: For the spicy wings, yes!

Talia is eating take out sushi and reading the soy sauce packet. She is tying to check out her ass-crack tattoo to see if it really does say 'Soy Sauce'. Mercedes has arrived. Talia sees her and comes out. Lamarr is around. Patience, too. We might notice that Dell Gordo and Larry now dress exactly alike, as we've seen the same jacket once on Lance Corona.
