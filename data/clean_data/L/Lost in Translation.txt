So, when he was a prisoner, they would tell them they had put poison in their food and they would make themselves throw up. and when he got back, he did better, but he still has food issues. He has to have really clean food. And really simple. He can't just go have, say, Chinese food.

Some people at the bar buy drinks for Bob and insist on drinking with him. Bob and Charlotte look over as Charlie gets into some problem with the BARTENDER. The Bartender gets mad and starts shooting a real-looking BB gun at him. Orange bullets fly through the air. They all rush out of there.

I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer. but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre. and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet.
BOB: You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
CHARLOTTE: But, I'm mean.
BOB: That's ok.

BOB: Do you know where we are?
CHARLOTTE: She puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake "one-cup". A tiny brad Pitt head smiles at her next to an iced coffee.
CHARLOTTE: Isn't it weird there are no street names in Tokyo. you'd think a city like this would have street names. you need a map to get anywhere. look, there are no signs.

The elevator stops at 54, he leans in to kiss her good-night. They kiss like you would on the cheek- but it's closer to their mouths. The door shuts- he missed his floor. The elevator continues up, and stops on her floor. They kiss good-night again and she gets out before the door closes. He watches the door close on her as she makes her way down the long beige hall.
