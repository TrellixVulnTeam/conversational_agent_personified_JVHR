FRONT DOOR: where a delivery man hands over a bouquet of VIOLET ORCHIDS. Claude, still perched on Ellen like a clothing accessory, spreads his impressive wings defensively. The delivery man scans the far wall to find a collection of bird photographs. A dazzling collection of all kinds of birds, elaborately framed and hung. Ellen signs the release and closes the door. She takes a deep smell of the violet orchids and looks down the hall to the open bedroom door with a glowing smile. We CATCH A GLIMPSE of a man dressing.
KITCHEN: Where Ellen and her husband are eating breakfast. Claude is now in a cage in the hallway. MR. MAURICE PARKER eats a buttered piece of raisin bread. He is a man in his late forties, neatly combed hair, his New York Times folded into a manageable rectangle. This is a man who has been seated a great deal of his life. the type of man who breaks into a sweat when taking out the garbage. He feels a stare and looks up to find his wife with that glowing smile. He smiles back. Ellen gestures with her eyes to the violet orchids now displayed proudly on the window ledge.
MAURICE: The flowers. they're beautiful.
ELLEN: The flowers. they're beautiful.
MAURICE: They are. who sent them? You thought I sent them?

ELLEN: ( flat ) It's just a regular day.
MAURICE: It's from Dan and Kate Wilkins. for dinner last week.
MAURICE: It's a special day isn't it?
ELLEN: Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other. I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance. and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'. Yes Maurice I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
MAURICE: You're mad at me. You were beaming a minute ago, but since I didn't send the flowers. now you're mad at me. Why would I send flowers? What's the occasion.
MAURICE: Why would I send flowers? What's the occasion.
ELLEN: Occasion? Because you love me. That's the occasion.

PARK BENCH: Maurice is seated on a park bench. Across from him is an ELDERLY COUPLE in their seventies. The OLD WOMAN is frail with tiny eyes that disappear when she smiles. The husband is a skinny man with a baseball hat that makes him look like a little boy. Maurice watches them silently as they sit and hold hands. Their warm laughs and whispered conversations stinging him. He watches as the old man gets up. The old woman tries to make him stay, but he playfully pulls away. She shakes her head like a shy school girl as the old man walks back down the path by himself. The old woman glances Maurice's way.
OLD WOMAN: Good morning.
MAURICE: Good morning.
OLD WOMAN: Is it a boy or a girl?
MAURICE: Oh, that's not mine.

MAURICE: I have to walk by myself all the way every inch.
ADELLE: It's impossible.
MAURICE: It's what she asked for. It's what I'm going to do.
ADELLE: She was being symbolic. What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
MAURICE: You'd be visiting me at Nasa. What if you don't make it?
ADELLE: ( whispering ) What if you don't make it?
MAURICE: I'll make it.
ADELLE: If you really want to do this. plan it out. Rest up. Train for it. Build up your body. Plan every stop along the way. How much money? Time? Really do it properly. This is all so by the seat of your pants.
MAURICE: No it's not.
ADELLE: Why did you take the back roads here? They're not safe. You'd know that if you'd planned. I've all ready gone six hundred miles. I can't do it again.
MAURICE: I've all ready gone six hundred miles. I can't do it again.
ADELLE: If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
MAURICE: Nothing's going to happen.
ADELLE: Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous. They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
ADELLE: Ellen, deserves you to do this right. Really make it if you're going to do it. She deserves it.
ADELLE: Do you want this? It's a long
ADELLE: We'll figure everything out when we get there. Oh, he's going to need a lot of help with this. He wasn't even going to come with me, I had to tell him that he could do the walk later if he plans well. I know, but by that time I'll have gotten him some treatment. I just want to get back home before he changes his mind.
ADELLE: You want something to eat?
ADELLE: I know you're feeling a lot of emotions right now. It's okay to be mad. It's okay to feel helpless. It's part of the healing process. I understand. I do.
ADELLE: He was exhausted slept the whole
ADELLE: Uncle Maurice we're home. Uncle
ADELLE: Uncle Maurice?
HOMELESS MAN: So this is the City of Brotherly
MAURICE: Ellen would have loved you.
MAURICE: How did that happen? It must've hit the window. I think its neck is broken.
ELLEN: ( shaky voice ) It must've hit the window. I think its neck is broken.
MAURICE: Don't bring it in here it probably has all kinds of diseases.
BEDROOM: Evening, just before bed. Maurice is reading. Ellen is monitoring the bird closely. It lays on the bedside table wrapped gently with a hand towel. A morsel of food is lowered into its mouth with a pair of tweezers. The bird stares blankly at the ceiling.
MAURICE: It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
ELLEN: It'll make it.
LIVING ROOM: The GRAPHIC IMAGES of the TV FLICKER on Maurice's face. He glances back to Ellen who talks to the bird cradled in her In the SOFT LIGHT of the lamp Ellen has transformed into a mother rocking her child to sleep.
ELLEN: ( softly ) You must miss flying. Being way up there in the clouds looking down at all of us. You miss that don't you? You miss playing with your friends and talking with them.
KITCHEN: Maurice is reading his paper.
ELLEN: Maurice! Maurice! Come out here.
BACKYARD: Ellen points to the ground. The little bird awkwardly walks around the porch. The bird's wings BURST into motion flapping hard catching the wind. Ellen jumps up and down, bursting with pride, as her little child takes flight.
MAURICE: I don't believe it.
ELLEN: All he needed was love. Once you have that, you can do anything. You'll be all right. A couple days and you'll be up there again. Ellen would have loved you.
MAURICE: You'll be all right. A couple days and you'll be up there again. Ellen would have loved you.
MAURICE: Ellen would have loved you.
ADELLE: Yes I understand, it does sound humorous, but this is a very serious situation.
GERALD: This smells good.
ADELLE: Why am I such an authority?
GERALD: ( under his breath ) Here comes the resume.
ADELLE: I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College. I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science". So I think it's safe to say my opinion is
ADELLE: Look, please find him for me. Officer, I tried. but I brought back the wrong person.
ADELLE: Stop laughing!
GERALD: Gerald's heart sinks as Adelle pops open the trash can with a tap of her foot and dumps the picture perfect meal into the garbage. She goes to the sink and rinses the plates completely preoccupied with her thoughts. She mumbles to herself as she shuts off the water.
ADELLE: He says he admires him.
HOTEL: The clock clicks past 11:30 am. Maurice is still in bed the curtains drawn. He crawls out from under the sheets and downs two pills with a glass of water. He looks bad. His face pale, his eyes at half-mast. He wipes unnatural sweat from his brow and melts into the bed again.
STREET: Just after dusk. A small town's main road. Maurice quietly passes under the street lights. He stares up and tightens the hood on his parka as the first SNOWFLAKE falls into the SHAFT OF THE STREET LIGHT. Soon thousands of flakes fall into the light.
GAZETTE BUILDING: Kris fields calls frantically as the LIGHTS BLINK ANXIOUSLY on his phone. The front page of the Gazette is posted on his pin up board. It reads. "HE MARCHES ON." Underneath is A PICTURE of Maurice standing outside his bookstore holding up THE BOOK SOCIETY MEDALLION proudly. A teenage boy gets off the elevator and maneuvers an enormous bag over his shoulder. emblazoned across his back are the words "MAIL ROOM." The boy comes to Kris and empties the bag on Kris' desk without a word. Hundreds of letters cascade down swallowing the table top and covering Kris who stares in awe as the letters keep coming.
MOTEL: Maurice is COUGHING PAINFULLY. He crouches over the edge of the bed and holds his side with every strain. Maurice looks worse than ever. His hair and shirt are soaked with sweat. The coughing attack stops. Maurice take a couple deep breaths before laying back down. His feet are visible sticking out from beneath the sheets. They look like someone has beaten them with a stick, swollen and bruised. They disappear under the sheets.
MAURICE: The cars IMPACT with a sickening CRUNCH BACK TO REAL TIME: The Firebird spins into a guardrail, breaking through it and coming to a stop in a bank of snow. The Volvo isn't so lucky. It flips from the impact. sliding on its roof, driving through the snow, down the road. It comes to a rest a hundred feet away. SILENCE. STILLNESS. The entire event took only seconds. Maurice runs frantically after the Volvo. The windows are SHATTERED. Snow has packed into the over-turned car. No one can be seen inside the vehicle. Maurice kneels down and punctures the wall of snow with his hand. His arm disappears up to the shoulder. His face grimacing with the strain. His arm comes out slowly. A few MUFFLED SOBS ARE HEARD BEFORE the little girl breaks through the wall of snow and slides out of the window. She lets out a DESPERATE GASP for air as Maurice pulls her out by the wrist. Maurice clears her mouth and face and watches as she coughs.
MAURICE: ( panting ) It's okay. It's all over.
MAURICE: ( frantic ) Oh no. she's wearing a seat-belt.
DRIVER: It wasn't my fault. It wasn't my
MAURICE: Come on. please.
MAURICE: She doesn't respond.
MAURICE: No Ellen. don't die.
THE MOTHER: being revived by Maurice. He pushes her chest in counting. push, count, breath. push, count, breath. The mother's BODY TWITCHES, slightly at first then obviously. The mother let's out a FEW PAINFUL COUGHS. She takes a breath. Life quickly returns to her body. Maurice places her head in his lap and hugs her, lightly rocking back and forth. The tears streaming down his red The SCENE BACKS OUT as Maurice comforts this stranger in his EXT. ROAD - AFTERNOON The police have descended on the scene. Traffic has been blocked off in both directions. The LIGHT thrown by the ambulances tints the snow and fields a THROBBING RED. Maurice's face can be seen in the shadows of the backseat of a police car.
MAURICE: Everything's going to be fine Ellen. I won't let anything happen to you. I love you sweetie. Everything's going to be different
HANSEN: What's his story?
TANDY: His name is Maurice. He's dancing around everything else.

MAURICE: Where are you taking me?
HANSEN: I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
TANDY: That's all right isn't it?
MAURICE: Hansen looks back to the road. The drive continues in silence. Tandy checks his watch just when a CLICK A HARD WIND AND A METALLIC SLAM in quick succession shakes the Tandy looks back Maurice is GONE. The back seat empty. Tandy stares out the blackness of the back window.
HANSEN: What the hell was that?
TANDY: Shit! He jumped!
HANSEN: Jumped where?
TANDY: Out of the car. He jumped out of the god damn car!
DRIVEWAY: Maurice's feet hit the snow of the driveway, just as his legs buckle his face HITS the snow hard. He manages to roll over on his back with great effort. He stares up at the pointed building the dull light becoming duller. something blocks the light. A man. Maurice feels himself rise into the air as two powerful arms scoop him off the ice. A PRIEST carries him into the doors of a CHURCH.
BACK ROOM: where Maurice is sitting in a chair wrapped in a blanket.
MAURICE: What did they ask?
FATHER: If I had seen you. By the way I'm sorry about your wife. They told Thank you. I'm sorry you had to lie. It must have been difficult.
MAURICE: Thank you. I'm sorry you had to lie. It must have been difficult.
FATHER: I asked the officers if you had committed some crime. If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
FATHER: Take these, and if you're up to it, try to explain how it is you came to be sitting here.
MAURICE: I'm walking for my wife. To where?
FATHER: To where?
MAURICE: Pacifica, California.
FATHER: From where?
MAURICE: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
FATHER: I see.
FATHER: Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
MAURICE: Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
FATHER: Most certainly.
MAURICE: And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
FATHER: That's a reasonable assumption.
MAURICE: I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
FATHER: Doubts? About what?
MAURICE: About my love for her.
FATHER: You don't have to prove anything to I'm not proving to her. I'm showing her. And I know I don't have to. I want to. I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her.

FATHER: I have spent my life dedicated to love. Love of God. Love of humanity. And here you are living through love. Bathing in it. Using its strength, its magic, its ability to overcome any barrier. If you are crazy, I hope my insanity is not far off.
HIGHWAY: The long trek continues. The black tar of the roads peek out in spots as the SUN BEATS down on the flatlands. Maurice drapes his worn scarf around a melting snowman.
RESTAURANT: We are looking inside a fancy Center-City Philadelphia restaurant. Adelle and Gerald are seated by an enormous bay window. A waiter comes to their table with their main course. Gerald watches the food being served with great Gerald's eyes drift out the window to the magazine stand on the sidewalk. He squints to see better. Realization hits hard. His eyes light up. He looks to Adelle and back to the magazine stand. In a mad race for time, Gerald begins to devour the food on his plate. The waiter and Adelle watch him in shock. Adelle glances out the window. Her eyes squint. then light up. She jumps to her feet and grabs Gerald by the arm, a fork full of food drops to his plate. Gerald looks back at his full plate longingly as Adelle pulls him out of the The waiter looks out the window to the magazine stand. He MAGAZINE STAND The NEW YORK TIMES are hung like stockings around the border of the stand. On the front pages, a singular headline stands out among the others:
MAGAZINE STAND: The NEW YORK TIMES are hung like stockings around the border of the stand. On the front pages, a singular headline stands out among the others:
DINER: A red-headed waitress slices a credit card through the machine and waits. Green computer letters blink - "This account has been closed." The waitress returns with the card she shakes her head "No" at Maurice who digs into his wallet for cash.
MOTEL: Maurice slides two twenties across the counter to the motel manager. Maurice checks the remaining bills in his wallet. only a few bills left. In the motel room we find Maurice sitting over the edge of a bed buckled over in a coughing attack. It finally stops. Maurice flops back to the pillows, completely drained.
ROADS: The flatlands have vanished. The roads now serpentine through mountain ranges. VIEW FROM THE MOUNTAIN RANGE; Maurice moves like a grain of dust over the black line of the road. Maurice rests every half mile. He labors up every incline with ultimate effort. He braces himself with a branch serving as a make due crutch. Maurice spots a small town nestled in the arms of the mountain range. He begins the journey to rest.
GROCERIES: Maurice pays for his food with the last few bills in his Another stick serves as a walking cane. The multi layers of clothes have been shed for a short-sleeve shirt. Maurice follows a dirt road that breaks free of the mountains and into the open country again.

"CALDWELLS.": CUT TO:
FRONT DOOR: Maurice tentatively moving to the front door. His hand instinctively clutches his empty stomach. The wind blows gently. Maurice shuts his eyes and takes a deep breath. He opens his eyes slowly to see a dinner table being set. Potatoes, gravy, fresh baked bread. floating through the half open window to Maurice's thankful smile.
MAURICE: Well, hello.
ISAAC: I'm Isaac. I'm three.
MAURICE: I'm Maurice Parker. I'm much older than three. Are your parents
ISAAC: You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.

ISAAC: You know what. I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
MAURICE: You'll probably be bigger than your
ISAAC: Isaac is happy with this thought. Maurice looks up as MRS. CALDWELL comes to the door.
MRS. CALDWELL: Who are you talking to Isaac?
MAURICE: Hello, I'm Maurice Parker. I'm just passing through and I need to conserve what little funds I have. I need some food and a roof to sleep under for one night. Now I don't look like much, but if there are any things that need to get done around the house Dave. you're not going to believe who's here.
MRS. CALDWELL: Dave. you're not going to believe who's here.
MRS. CALDWELL: This is Maurice Parker the one walking for his wife.
MR. CALDWELL: If that ain't fate?. Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell. I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down Evening News?

MAURICE: I thought you were asleep.
ISAAC: You know what. I remembered you were here and I woke up.
MAURICE: Your parents would want you to be in bed.
ISAAC: You tell stories?
MAURICE: Oh no. I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact.
MAURICE: I would be exceedingly boring.
MAURICE: I don't do these type of things.
MAURICE: See there are two kinds of people in this world. . Just a short one okay?
MAURICE: There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play. but he kept practicing by himself waiting. He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
ISAAC: You know what. maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
MAURICE: Who's telling this story?
MAURICE: Good, now the team had this great big player Big Billy. He was the best. He had them in the World Super-Bowl-Championship of little kids baseball. But right before the game, the second best player on the team was suspended because he played a prank on a nice man who owned a book store. When that boy grew up he was convicted on burglary charges and spent fifteen years in prison where he
MAURICE: Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands. 'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
ISAAC: ( beaming ) That's me.
MAURICE: Right. But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed. but not Big Billy. He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game. It came to the end of the game. It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game.
ISAAC: Okay nine. Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base. That's when Isaac came up. He could barely hold the bat. Big Billy winked at Isaac. The ball was pitched Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium. Everyone cheered. Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play. Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first. Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together. The end.

MR. CALDWELL: That's a nice watch.
MR. CALDWELL: I've always wanted a watch like It's yours.
MAURICE: ( unstrapping it ) It's yours.
MR. CALDWELL: No. I won't take it unless I pay for it. Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch I can see
MR. CALDWELL: Let's say I give you what's in this envelope for that beautiful watch.
MR. CALDWELL: I really want that watch.

OUTDOOR WEDDING: A beautiful canopy of flowers sits at the end of ten rows of lawn chairs. Maurice watches from near the cars. He smiles as the young bride and groom nervously say their vows. Everyone LAUGHS warmly as the groom stumbles over his lines.
SIDE ROOM: Young Maurice sits on a chair in a tuxedo staring out the half-open door to an OLD MAN who tries to gain his balance by holding onto the wall. Maurice is upset.

INSIDE LIMOUSINE: They wave through the window as the car pulls away. They settle in and look to the seat across from them. On the seat is a fresh flower. Next to the flower is a note. The groom picks it up and shows it to the bride. It reads:

ADELLE: I can't believe it.
TV ANCHOR: Whatever has carried Mr. Parker through snow and rain and thousands of miles of this countryside, will have to carry him through the most dangerous part of his trek. The three hundred miles through the sweltering roads of Nevada.
ADELLE: My God.
DUSK: The SUN TURNS RED for one brilliant moment before hiding behind the horizon. Like an alarm went off, Maurice wakes up and packs his things.
ROAD: The MOONLIGHT outlines a line figure hobbling his way step by step with a walking stick. The air fills with a POWERFUL RUMBLE. Maurice turns to see a wave of rocks and sand slide down a hillside to the road. They CAUSE A GREAT THUNDER that settles to dust. Maurice walks down the center of the highway away from the hillside.
HIGHWAY: Maurice uses a highway guardrail as a backrest. He takes a seat in the dirt. Maurice's hair is damp with sweat. His breathing relegated to slow gasps. His left hand covering his rib cage protectively. Blood begins to trickle through the spaces between his fingers. Maurice closes his eyes for a moment, before his bent leg goes into spasms. Maurice is forced to straighten the leg instantly. jarring his tender rib cafe. Maurice clings to the back of his thigh. Maurice is defeated. On the verge of tears. He glances way down the road and spots a TINY CLOUD OF SMOKE miles away in the distance. A car is moving in his Maurice looks up into the DAZZLING WHITE SKY. Drops of sweat falling into his eyes.
MAURICE: ( whisper ) It's over Ellen. I failed you I tried Ellen, I really tried. I don't have the strength.
MAURICE: I tried Ellen, I really tried. I don't have the strength.
MAURICE: You said I would never be alone!. You promised. . You promised.
ROAD: The car on the road, takes the last quarter mile in seconds. SCREECHING IT'S BRAKES at the sight of Maurice on the side of the road. Maurice turns away from the bird as the car pulls up. The driver gets out and calls over the hood.
DRIVER: Hey, man are you okay? I'm fine.
MAURICE: I'm fine.
DRIVER: What the hell are you doing out here? You need a ride somewhere?
MAURICE: No thank you.
DRIVER: You by yourself?
MAURICE: This pacifies the driver somewhat. He nods and gets in the car. Maurice watches as the car pulls away. He turns back to the guardrail the eagle is gone. Maurice looks up into the sky. The Golden Eagle is flying overhead. a tiny dot against the blazing sun. Maurice struggles to his feet using the guardrail as support. Maurice takes his first step.
JANIS: Who is that?
AMMIE: I don't know. What's the matter with him?
MAURICE'S POV: Maurice is on the edge of darkness. the trees and faces swimming mixed with the colors of red and blue cloth waving in the wind. Images come in and out of focus. two women walking towards him. Maurice clutches his head as the trees start to swim faster color, lights, houses.
STEPHANIE: There are a lot of people worried about you.
MAURICE: ( softly ) Where am I?
STEPHANIE: In a hospital.
MAURICE: Which hospital? Did you take me

ADELLE: Maybe later.
MAURICE: You should definitely have children. They're really special.
ADELLE: I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
MAURICE: How serious is it? You have two broken ribs, a punctured spleen and Acute Rheumatoid Arthritis.
DR. RAY: You have two broken ribs, a punctured spleen and Acute Rheumatoid Arthritis.
DR. RAY: The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion. This is called, "Claudication," As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body. That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.

ADELLE: Let me tell you a story Sergeant. There was a patient of mine who had a Golden Retriever, Mac. She loved Mac, not like a pet, but like a family member. One day, she had to leave Mac with 'friends', and wouldn't you know it, Mac gets away and ends up falling into a sewer. My patient comes back goes nuts when she hears that Mac has been in the sewer for over 48 hours. Apparently the cop who found the dog didn't want to get his pants dirty. And neither did anyone else. So of course, my patient decides to go in after it. she falls. breaks her hip and lands next to her dead dog, who died of toxic fumes down there.
ADELLE: The moral of the story is. She sued for a lot of money! She sued the friends, the city, and the officer for negligence on duty. She has no Mac, no happiness, but she's very rich now. That was a dog. We're talking about a human I hope everyone clearly understands the chain of events that will occur if something should happen to my uncle, whom I love more than you can possibly imagine. Now Sergeant I would like to know right now, if you're willing to get your pants dirty for my uncle?
