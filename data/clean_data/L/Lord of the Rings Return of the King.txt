DEAGOL: ( excited ) Smeagol, I've got one! ( he laughs ) I've got a fish, Smeagol!
SMEAGOL: ( excitedly ) Go on, pull it in. ( worried )
SMEAGOL: Give us that, Deagol, my love!
DEAGOL: CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL moves towards DEAGOL . . .
SMEAGOL: Because its my birthday, and I wants it. My precious!
GOLLUM: It's mine! My own. It came to me.
SMEAGOL: ( ecstatic ) My Precious.
GOLLUM: Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We must go, yes, we must go at once!
SAM: Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo? I've gone and had too much!
FRODO: No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet. The days are growing darker.
GOLLUM: Come on, must go, no time .
SAM: Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.
GOLLUM: . . . no time to lose, silly.
SAM: What about you?
FRODO: What about you?
SAM: ( lying badly ) I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas ( confessing ) Alright. We don't have that much left.
FRODO: ( confessing ) Alright. We don't have that much left.
SAM: ( confessing ) Alright. We don't have that much left.
FRODO: For what?
SAM: The journey home.
GOLLUM: Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry!
PIPPIN: I feel like I ' m back at the Green Dragon, after a hard days work.
MERRY: Only, you've never done a hard days work. Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.
GANDALF: ANGLE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI stare at the SIGHT before them . . .
GIMLI: You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on, and now we find you feasting and We are sitting on a field of victory, enjoying a few well-earned comforts. The salted pork is particularly good.
PIPPIN: ( mouth full ) We are sitting on a field of victory, enjoying a few well-earned comforts. The salted pork is particularly good.
GIMLI: ( suddenly interested ) Salted pork?
GANDALF: ( shaking his head )
MERRY: We're under orders from Treebeard, who's taken over management of Isengard.
TREEBEARD: Huraroom . Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad you've come. Wood and water, stock and , stone I can master, but there's a wizard to be managed here . Locked in his tower.
GANDALF: And there Saruman must remain, under your guard, Treebeard.
GIMLI: Let's just have his head and be done with it. .
GANDALF: ( quietly ) No. He has no power any more.
TREEBEARD: The filth of Saruman is washing away . Trees will come back to live here, young trees . . . wild trees.
GANDALF: ( urgent ) Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad! Quickly, now!
CUT: INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EVENING WIDE: A ROARING FIRE; a LAMB ROASTING on SPI; LONG TABLES laden with FOOD; BARRELS of WINE; a banquet is-laid ready for the returning soldiers.
THEODEN: Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. Hail the victorious dead!
EOWYN: Westu Aragorn hal.
THEODEN: I am happy for you. He is an honourable man.
EOWYN: ( smiling ) You are both honourable men.
THEODEN: It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory. Don't listen to me - you are young, and tonight is for you.
ARAGORN: No news of Frodo?
GANDALF: No word . nothing.
ARAGORN: We till have time. Every day Frpdo moves closer to Mordor.
GANDALF: Do we know that?
ARAGORN: ( gently ) What does your heart tell you?
GANDALF: ( with a small smile ) That Frodo is alive. ( to himself ) Yes - yes, he is alive.
SMEAGOL: Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them . kill them both!
GOLLUM: ( hissed whisper ) Shhh! Quiet! Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!
SMEAGOL: They knows, they knows, they suspects us.
GOLLUM: And we will . . ,- Smeagol did it once. . . . . . He can do it again. It's ours - ours!
SMEAGOL: We must get the Precious. We must get it Patience, patience, my love. First we must lead them to her.
GOLLUM: Patience, patience, my love. First we must lead them to her.
SMEAGOL: We lead them to the windy stairs.
GOLLUM: ( prompting ) Yes, the stairs . and then?
SMEAGOL: Up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until we come to . . . . the Tunnel!
GOLLUM: ( quiet ) And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry, she always needs to feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, Precious? .
SMEAGOL: And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, Precious? .
GOLLUM: ( sinister ) No . . . not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats . . . "Hobbit meat." And when She throws away the bones and the empty clothes, then we will find it . . .
SMEAGOL: And take it for Me!
GOLLUM: ( correcting ) For us . . .
SMEAGOL: Yes, we, we meant for us . . . Go Hum! Go Hum!
GOLLUM: ( sly ) The Precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead!
SAM: ( yelling ) ,· . You treacherous little toad!
GOLLUM: ( crying ) No! Not! Help! Master!
FRODO: No, Sam! Leave him alone!
SAM: ( fuming ) I heard it from his own mouth he means to murder us!
SMEAGOL: Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies!
SAM: You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!
FRODO: Sm. . . Call me a liar! You're a liar!
SAM: Call me a liar! You're a liar!
FRODO: Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.
SAM: I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I won' t wait around for him to kill us !
FRODO: ( fierce whisper ) I'm not sending him away.
SAM: You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!
FRODO: ( lowers voice ) We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side.
SAM: ( taken aback ) I'm on your side, Mr Frodo.
FRODO: I know, Sam, I know. You must trust me. Come, Smeagol.
LEGOLAS: The stars are veiled, something stirs in the east . . . A sleepless malice. The eye of the enemy is moving.
MERRY: ( whispers ) What you doing?
PIPPIN: I just want to look at it. Just one more Put it back! Put - it - back!
MERRY: Put it back! Put - it - back!
LEGOLAS: ( urgent ) He is here.
MERRY: Help! Someone help him!
GANDALF: Fool of a Took!
MERRY: PIPPIN is trembling . GANDALF calms him . . .
PIPPIN: Gandalf! Forgive me.
PIPPIN: ( disjointed ) A tree . There was a white tree . . . in a courtyard of stone . . . It was dead! The city was burning .
GANDALF: Minas Tirith??? Is that what you saw?
PIPPIN: ( terrified ) I saw . . . I saw him . . . I could hear his voice in my head.
GANDALF: And what did you tell him? Speak!
PIPPIN: He asked me my name, I didn't answer . . . he hurt me . . .
GANDALF: What did you tell him about Frodo and the
GANDALF: There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.
THEODEN: ( quietly ) Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? What do we owe Gondor?
ARAGORN: ( low and urgent ) I will go.
GANDALF: ( hurried ) They must be warned.
ARAGORN: They must be warned.
GANDALF: They will be. You must come to Minas Tirith by another ra . Follow the river, look to the black ships. Understand this . . . things are now in motion that cannot be undone.
GANDALF: Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin, Took, you are the worst. Hurry, hurry!
PIPPIN: ( worried ) Where are we going?
MERRY: Why did you look - why do you always have to look?
MERRY: You never can.
PIPPIN: ( lightly ) . . . . ,.; · I'm sorry, alright? I won't do it again.
MERRY: Don't you understand . the Enemy thinks you have the Ring . . . he's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here!
PIPPIN: And you. You're coming with me . . . Come on!
MERRY: Come on!
PIPPIN: ( nervous ) How far is Minas Tirith?
GANDALF: Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and you'd better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
MERRY: Here - something for the road.
PIPPIN: The last of the Longbottom Leaf.
MERRY: I know you've run out . . . you smoke too much, Pip.
PIPPIN: But we'11 see each other soon? Won't we?
MERRY: I don't know . . . I don't know what's going to happen.
PIPPIN: ( rising panic )
GANDALF: Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of
PIPPIN: ( panicked )
ELF ESCORT: We cannot delay.
ELROND: ANGLE ON: ARWEN breathing hard, walking towards ELROND with a fierce light in her eyes . . .
ARWEN: You have the gift of foresight - tell me what you have seen.
ELROND: I looked into your future and I saw death.
ARWEN: There is also life. , You saw there was a child . . . you saw my son.
ELROND: ( quietly ) That future is almost gone.
ARWEN: But it is not lost .
ELROND: Nothing is certain.
ARWEN: Some things are certain. If I leave him now I will regret It forever. Ada, it is time.
ARWEN: Ada .
ELROND: Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you. It has begun.
ARWEN: This was my choice. Ada . Whether by your will or not, there is no ship now that can bear me hence.
GANDALF: We have just passed into the realm of
GANDALF: Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.
GANDALF: Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King.
GANDALF: Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor. I come with tidings in this dark hour - and with counsel.
DENETHOR: ( bitter ) Perhaps you come to explain this?
.. PIPPIN: Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and me . . . he fell, defending us from many
GANDALF: ( hurried whisper )
PIPPIN: I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt.
GANDALF: ( to PIPPIN ) Get up! ( a ddre ssin g D ENET HOR ) My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming . the Enemy is on your doorstep. As Steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are Condor's armies?
DENETHOR: ( softly ) You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. ( contemptuous ) I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North - last of a ragged house, long bereft of Lordship.
GANDALF: ( stung ) Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King - Steward!
DENETHOR: ( explosive ) The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!
GANDALF: GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL . DENETHOR slumps back into his SEAT.
PIPPIN: So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial position . . . I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?
GANDALF: You're in the service of the Steward now - you're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took . . . Guard of the Citadel!
PIPPIN: It's so quiet.
GANDALF: It's the deep breath before the plunge.
PIPPIN: I don't want to be in a battle . . . but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse. L Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and
GANDALF: There never was much hope. Just a fool's hope.
GANDALF: This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammerstroke will fall
PIPPIN: But we have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something.
GANDALF: The Witchking of Angmar . . .
GOLLUM: ( whisper ) The Dead City, very nasty place, full of . enemies. ( hissed whisper ) Quick! Quick! They will see, they will see.
SAM: No, Mr Frodo!
GOLLUM: ( desperate ) Not that way! What's it doing?
SAM: SAM and GOLLUM pull FRODO from the BRIDGE.
FRODO: ( disorientated ) They're calling me!
GOLLUM: Hide! Hide!
RAGGED COLUMNS!: EXT. MINAS TIRITH BALCONY - NIGHT CLOSE ON: GANDALF . .. .
GANDALF: ( quiet ) We come to it at last . the great battle of our time.
GOLLUM: ( urgent ) Come, hobbits. We climb - we must climb!
GANDALF: ( to himself ) The board is set, the pieces are moving.
GANDALF: Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth! You must not fail me.
GOTHMOG: ( to his oarsmen )
FARAMIR: ( urgent ) To the river - quick!
GOTHMOG: ON THE RIVER the BOATS quietly advance.
ORC COMMANDER: Draw swords!
BEACON!: TWO bored CITADEL GUARDS sit chatting . passing the long EXT. MINAS TIRITH STREETS - DAWN ANGLE ON: GANDALF as he waits tensely below . . .
GANDALF: ( to himself ) Amon Din . come on . . .
SOLDIER: ( yelling ) The beacon! The beacon at Amon Din is lit!
GANDALF: ( to himself ) Hope is kindled.
ARAGORN: The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit! Condor calls for aid!
THEODEN: Then Rohan will answer. Muster the
THEODEN: Assemble the army at Dunharrow - as many men as can be found. You have two days . On the third, we ride for Condor . and
ARAGORN: You ride with us?
EOWYN: Just to the encampment. It's tradition for the women of the Court to farewell the men.
EOMER: Now is the hour! Riders of Rohan - oaths you have taken. Now, fulfil them all - to Lord and land!
MADRIL: We can't hold them. The city is lost!
FARAMIR: Tell the men to break up. We ride for Minas
RANGER: SPINNING ANGLE: FARAMIR looks up at the SKY . . . ITHILIEN RANGERS are suddenly nervous, frightened . . . A HUGE SHADOW passes overhead!
FARAMIR: Take cover! Pull back! Pull back to Minas Tirith!
GOTHMOG: The age of men is over. The time of the Ore has come.
IORLAS: Open the Gates! Pull!
FARAMIR: ANGLE ON: FARAMIR STEERS HIS HORSE through the CROWD towards
IORLAS: It is as the Lord Denethor predicted - long has he foreseen this doom!
GANDALF: Foreseen and done nothing! Faramir? . This is not the first halfling to have crossed your path .
FARAMIR: ( disbelief ) You've seen Frodo and Sam?
PIPPIN: ( disbelief ) You've seen Frodo and Sam?
GANDALF: Where? When?
FARAMIR: In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf - they are taking the road to the Morgul . . . And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.
GANDALF: ( shocked realisation ) . . . And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.
PIPPIN: What does that mean? What's wrong?
GANDALF: ( urgent ) Faramir . . . Tell me everything.
GOLLUM: Careful, Master - careful! Very far to fall. Very dangerous on the stairs.
GOLLUM: Come, Master.
SAM: ( alarmed yell ) Mr Frodo! Get back, you. Don't touch him!
GOLLUM: Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has Smeagol ever done to him? Master?
WITCH KING: ( clinical ) Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. Slay them What of the Wizard?
GOTHMOG: What of the Wizard?
WITCH KING: I shall break him.
SOLDIER 1: ( worried ) Where are Theoden's riders?
SOLDIER 2: Will Rohan's army come?
SOLDIER 1: G AN DA LF ( grim )
PIPPIN: ( nervous ) Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me.
DENETHOR: And I shall not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given . . fealty with love .
A: DENETHOR ( cont'd ) ( reasonable )
FARAMIR: What would you have me do?
DENETHOR: I will not yield the River and Pelennor unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.
FARAMIR: My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.
DENETHOR: Much must be risked in war. Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his Lord's will?
FARAMIR: ( quietly ) You wish now that our places had been exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had
DENETHOR: ( coldly ) Yes, I wish that.
FARAMIR: Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead. If I should return . think better of me,. That will depend on the manner of your
DENETHOR: That will depend on the manner of your
SAM: What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?
SMEAGOL: ( prevaricating ) Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh yes, my Precious, very nice.
SAM: Alright, alright - you just startled me is What were you doing?
SMEAGOL: ( sly )
SAM: Fine, have it your own way. Sorry to wake you, Mr Frodo. We have to be moving on.
SAM: It's always dark here - It's gone . . . the Elven bread!
FRODO: ( alarmed ) What? That's all we have left!
SAM: ( dawning realisation ) He took it! He must have!
GOLLUM: ( shocked ) Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread!
SAM: You're a lying wretch! What did you do with He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken
FRODO: He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken
GOLLUM: What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses! He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's always stuffing himself when Master's not That's a filthy lie! You stinking two-faced sneak! Call me a thie . . .
SAM: ( angry ) That's a filthy lie! You stinking two-faced sneak! Call me a thie . . .
FRODO: ( yelling ) Sam! Stop it!
SAM: ( yelling ) I'll kill him! I'll kill him!
FRODO: No, Sam!
SAM: Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to go so far, I was so angry . . . Here, let's rest up a bit.
FRODO: ( exhausted ) I ' m alright.
SAM: No, no, you're not alright! You're exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this place; it's that thing around your neck. I could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a while - share the load.
FRODO: Get away!
SAM: ( confused ) I don't want to keep it . . . I just want to
GOLLUM: See! See! He wants it for himself.
SAM: ( beside himself ) Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here.
FRODO: ( quietly ) No, Sam . . . it's you.
SAM: ( hopelessly ) But . . . he's a liar . . . he's poisoned you against me.
FRODO: You can't help me anymore.
SAM: You don't mean that.
FRODO: ( eerie calm ) Go home.
GANDALF: Faramir! Your father's will has turned to madness! Do not throw away your life so Where does my allegiance lie if not here?
FARAMIR: ( deadened ) Where does my allegiance lie if not here?
GANDALF: Your father loves you, Faramir! And will remember it before the end.
DENETHOR: Can you sing, Master Hobbit?
PIPPIN: ( uneasy ) Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my own people . but we have no songs for great halls and evil times . . . we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or And why should your songs be unfit for my halls, or for hours such as these. Come - sing me a song!
DENETHOR: And why should your songs be unfit for my halls, or for hours such as these. Come - sing me a song!
THEODEN: Grimbold, how many?
GRIMBOLD: I bring five hundred men from the Westfold, my Lord.
DENETHOR: ( quietly ) Where are the riders from Snowbourne?
THEODEN: ( quietly ) Six thousand spears . . . less than half of what I had hoped for . . .
ARAGORN: Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
THEODEN: More will come.
LEGOLAS: ( uneasy ) The horses are restless . . . And the men are -;. quiet ..?
EOMER: They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain . . .
GIMLI: That road there - where does that lead?
LEGOLAS: It is the road to the Dimholt . The door under the mountain.
EOMER: None who venture there ever return. That mountain is evil . . .
GIMLI O.S: ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stares down at the LITTLE DWARF . . .
GIMLI: Let's find some food.
EOWYN: There! A true Esquire of Rohan.
MERRY: Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous. It isn't even sharp.
EOWYN: Well, that's no good. You won't kill many Ores with a blunt blade. Come on.
EOWYN: To the Smithy .- go!
EOMER: You should not encourage him.
EOWYN: And you should not doubt him.
EOMER: I do not doubt his heart . Only the reach of his arm.
EOWYN: Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause to go to war as you. Why can he not fight for those he loves?
GUARD: King Theoden awaits you, my Lord.
THEODEN: I take my leave.
ARAGORN: My Lord, Elrond.
ELROND: I come on behalf of one whom I love. Arwen is dying.
ARAGORN: She stayed?
ELROND: She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor. The light of the Evenstar is failing. As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes. Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the end has come.
ARAGORN: It will not be our end, but his.
ELROND: You ride to war, but not to victory. Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith - this you know - but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river . . . A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the They will be in the city in two days . . . You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more There are none.
ARAGORN: There are none.
ELROND: ( quietly ) There are those who dwell in the mountain.
ARAGORN: Murderers, traitors - you would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no-one.
ELROND: They will answer to the King of Condor. Anduril, flame of the West . . . forged from the shards of Narsil.
ARAGORN: Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil . . . . . . the blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.
ELROND: The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. Put aside the Ranger - become who you were born to be - take the Dimhplt Road. Onen i-estel Edain. /, ,-, ARAGORN U-chebin estel anim. I keep none for myself.
EOWYN: Why are you doing this? The war lies to.the East. You cannot leave on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon ; the men.
ARAGORN: Eowyn . . .
· EOWYN: We need you here - ,
ARAGORN: Why have you come?
EOWYN: ( hesitant ) Do you not know?
ARAGORN: ( gentle ) It is but a shadow and a thought that you love . . . I cannot give you what you seek.
GIMLI: And just where do you think you're off to?
ARAGORN: Not this time . This time you must stay, my friend.
LEGOLAS O.S: Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves?
GIMLI: You might as well accept it - we're going with you, laddie.
GAMLING: Lord Aragorn!
GAMLING: He leaves because there is no hope.
THEODEN: He leaves because he must.
GAMLING: Too few have come. We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.
THEODEN: No, we cannot . . . But we will meet them in battle,
THEODEN: ( gentle ) I have left instruction: the people are to follow your rule in my stead . take up my seat in the Golden Hall . long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.
EOWYN: What other duty would you have me do, my
THEODEN: ( quiet ) Duty? . No, I would have you smile again - not grieve for those whose time has come. You shall live to see these days renewed. ( whisper ) No more despair.
GIMLI: What kind of an army would linger in such a One that is cursed . Long ago the Men of the Mountain swore an oath to the last King of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight, but when the time came, when Condor's need was dire, they fled . Vanishing into the darkness of the mountain . And so Isildur cursed them - never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.
LEGOLAS: One that is cursed . Long ago the Men of the Mountain swore an oath to the last King of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight, but when the time came, when Condor's need was dire, they fled . Vanishing into the darkness of the mountain . And so Isildur cursed them - never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.
GIMLI: ( terrified whisper ) The very warmth of my blood seems stolen
LEGOLAS: ( translating ) The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
ARAGORN: ( CONTINUED )
GIMLI: Well, this is a thing unheard of . An Elf will go underground when a Dwarf dare not. Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it!
THEODEN: We must ride light and swift. It's a long road ahead . and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight.
MERRY: All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left behind!
THEODEN: It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith. None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.
MERRY: But . . . I want to fight!
THEODEN: I will say no more.
SADDLE!: CLOSE ON: MERRY twists around, looking up at the SOLDIER . . . Beneath a HELMET and MAIL HOOD is . . . . . . EOWYN, disguised as a MAN!
EOWYN: ( grimly ) Ride with me.
MERRY: My Lady!
EXCITED!: ( CONTINUED )
EOMER: ( shouting above the din ) Move out - move out!
THEODEN: Ride! Ride now, for Gondor!
ARAGORN: One who will have your allegiance.
ARAGORN: You will suffer me!
AE: ANGLE ON: The FOG suddenly ROLLS BACK, forming a retreating wall of GREY VAPOUR . slowly, RANK upon RANK of SPECTRAL WARRIORSare revealed! GHOULISH FACES . . . RUSTING WEAPONS . . .
ARAGORN: ( desperate ) I summon you to fulfil your oath!
ARAGORN: It has been remade!
GIMLI: Aghh! Your wasting your time, Aragprn. They had no honour in life, they have none now in death.
ARAGORN: ( yelling ) I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me and I will hold your oath fulfilled. What say
GATE GUARD: ( yelling ) Open the gate! Quick!
IORLAS: ( shocked ) Lord Faramir!
DENETHOR: DENETHOR bends to the STRETCHER bearing his SON.
IORLAS: They were outnumbered, none survived.
GOTHMOG: Fear! The city is rank with it. Let us ease their pain. Release the prisoners!
LIEUTENANT: At his ORDERS, the GREAT CATAPULTS fire THWAT! THWAT! THWAT!
SOLDIERS!: EXT. MINAS TIRITH COURT OF THE KINGS - DAY DENETHOR looks down at FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY . . .
DENETHOR: My son is dead. My line is ended.
PIPPIN: ( touching Faramir's forehead ) He's alive!
DENETHOR: The House of Stewards has failed! . . .
PIPPIN: ( urgently ) ; He needs medicine, my Lord!
DENETHOR: My line has ended.
PIPPIN: ( urgently ) My Lord!
DENETHOR: ( rasping whisper ) Rohan has deserted us!
GANDALF: ( yell ) Prepare for battle!!
GANDALF: ( yelling ) Return to your posts!
GANDALF: ( angry yell ) Send these foul beasts into the abyss!
GOTHMOG: Stay where you are!
ARMOUR!: ANGLES ON: SOLDIERS throw themselves down as the NAZGUL zoom overhead, emitting their PIERCING SHRIEKS! GONDORIAN SOLDIERS run for SHELTER in PANIC, covering their ears .
GANDALF: ( rallying ) Stand to your posts! Do not give in to fear. Fight!
PIPPIN: ( stupor ) They called us out to fight . . .
GANDALF: ( urgency ) This is no place for a Hobbit! Guard of the Citadel, indeed! Now, back up the hill - quickly! Quickly!
ORCS: Grond! Grond! Grond!
IRON MONSTER"'!: CUT TO:
FRODO: ( exhausted ) What is this place?
GOLLUM: Master must go inside the tunnel.
FRODO: Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.
SMEAGOL: It's the only way. Go in - or go back.
FRODO: ( under his breath ) I can't go back.
FRODO: What's that smell?
GOLLUM: ( lying ) Orcses filth! Orcses come in here

SAM: Let him go, you filth! You will not touch him again! Come on and finish it!
HARSH SHOUTS!: CLOSE ON: SAM looks up . . . looks back down FRODO. CLOSE ON: SAM looks up at the ORC TOWER and then at STING which is glowing BLUE! ORCS approach - SAM must make a ANGLE ON: A SMALL PARTY of ORCS and URUK-HAI heading down the STAIRS from the WATCH TOWER! . . . SHAGRAT leads the URUK-HAI, and GORBAG leads the ORCS. GORBAG spies FRODO'S BODY . . .
GORBAG: What's this? Looks like Old Shelob's been having a bit of fun!
SHAGRAT: Killed another one, has she?
GORBAG: No . . . this fellow ain't dead.
SAM: ( to himself ) Not dead!
GORBAG: ( excited ). She jabs them with her stinger and they go as limp as a boned fish. Then she has her way with them. That's how she likes to feed - fresh blood. ( yelling ) Get him to the Tower!
SAM: Samwise, you fool!
ORC 2: This fellow will be awake in a few hours.
GORBAG: Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

EOMER: Drive them into the river!
PANICKING ROHIRRIM!: EOWYN and MERRY are THROWN from their HORSE .
PIPPIN: ( quiet ) I didn't think it would end this way . . .
GANDALF: ( gently ) End? No, the journey doesn't end here.
PIPPIN: What, Gandalf? See what?
GANDALF: White shores . And beyond . . . A far green country under a swift sunrise.
PIPPIN: ( quiet ) Well, that isn't so bad.
GANDALF: ( gently ) No . . . No, it isn't.
BOOM!: ANGLE ON: GANDALF and PIPPIN'S faces turn as the WOODEN DOORS shudder under another BLOW.
THEODEN: ( yelling ) Rally to me! To me!
EOWYN!: I will kill you if you touch him!
EOWYN: I will kill you if you touch him!
KILLING BLOW!: CUT TO:
ORC COMMANDER: ( angry ) Late as usual! Get off your ships, you sea rats! There's knife work here needs doing.
GIMLI: · ··· Plenty for the both of us . . . May the best
WITCH KING: No man can kill me . . . Die! I am no man!
EOWYN: I am no man!
GIMLI: That still only counts as one!
THEODEN: ( gasping weakly ) I know your face . Eowyn . My eyes darken .
EOWYN: No . . . I am going to save you .
THEODEN: ( loving ) You already did . . . ( clutching her hand ) My body is broken . you have to let me go
EOWYN: N .
THEODEN: I go to my fathers . . . in whose mighty company, I shall not now feel ashamed .
LOW CLOUDS!: ANGLE ON: GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI and PIPPIN watch as . . . ARAGORN walks slowly across the FIELD OF BATTLE towards the
GIMLI: ( quietly ) Bad idea. Very handy in a tight spot, these lads - despite the fact, they're dead!
ARAGORN: I hold your oath fulfilled . . . Go. Be at
PIPPIN: Merry .? Merry . . . it's me, it's Pippin . . .
MERRY: ( groggy ) I knew you'd find me. ( disorientated ) Are you going to leave me?
PIPPIN: No Merry, I'm going to look after you.
SHAGRAT: Hey! Hands off - that shiny shirt, that's It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else . . .
GORBAG: It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else . . .
SHAGRAT: I don't take orders from stinking Morgul
GORBAG: ( angry yell ) You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your guts!
SHAGRAT: ( yelling ) The scum tried to knife me! Kill him!
SAM: ( yelling . . . 1st URUK-HAI ) ·
GORBAG: Stop your squeaking you dunghill rat! I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!
SAM!: Not if I stick you first!
SAM: Not if I stick you first!
FRODO: ( joyous disbelief ) Oh, Sam . . . I'm so sorry . . . sorry for
SAM: Come on.
FRODO: ( despairing ) It's too late. It's over . . . they've taken it. Sam - they took the Ring!!
SAM: ( quietly ) Begging your pardon, but they haven't. I thought I ' d lost you . . . so I took it - only for safe-keeping.
IG: Give it to me. Give me the Ring, Sam. Sam! Give me the Ring. You must understand . . . The Ring is my burden . . . it will destroy you, Sam.
FRODO: Give it to me. Give me the Ring, Sam. Sam! Give me the Ring. You must understand . . . The Ring is my burden . . . it will destroy you, Sam.
SAM: Come on, Mr Frodo, we'd best find you some clothes . . . you can't go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin.
SAM: We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor.
FRODO: There are so many of them . . . So many. We'll never get through unseen. It's him - the Eye.
SAM: We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.
GANDALF: Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening.
ARAGORN: If Sauron had the .Ring, we would know it.
GANDALF: It's only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping.
GIMLI: Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should we care?
GANDALF: Because ten thousand Ores now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.
ARAGORN: GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN . . .
GANDALF: Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.
ARAGORN: Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.
EOMER: We cannot achieve victory from strength of arms .
ARAGORN: Not for ourselves . . . But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron' s eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves .
LEGOLAS: A diversion . . .
GANDALF: ( doubtful ) Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait!
GIMLI: Certainty of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for?
SAM: Look, the Ores! They're moving off. You see, Mr Frodo - some luck at last.
SAM: Take mine . . . there's a few drops left.
FRODO: There'll be none left for the return I don't think there will be a return journey, Mr Frodo.
SAM: ( softly ) I don't think there will be a return journey, Mr Frodo.
SAM: Fo o g td w
PIPPIN: ( wary ) Where are they?
ARAGORN: Let the lord of the Black Land come forth; let justice be done upon him.
ARAGORN: Pull back! Pull back!
SAM: It's gone, Mr Frodo. The light's passed on, away towards the North . . . something's drawn it's gaze.
ARAGORN: Hold your ground - hold your ground! Sons of Gondor - of Rohan . . . my brothers! I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. The day may come when the courage of Men fails; when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship; but it is not this day - an hour of wolves and shattered shields, when the Age of Man comes crashing down - but it is not this day!!! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth - I bid you stand!
GIMLI: Never thought I ' d die fighting side by side with an Elf.
LEGOLAS: ( quietly ) What about side by side with a friend?
GIMLI: Aye - I could do that.
SAM: ( softly ) Do you remember the Shire, Mr Frodo? . . . It'll be spring soon, and the orchards will be in blossom; and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket; and they'11 be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields; and eating the first of the strawberries with cream. ( looking down at FRODO ) Do you remember the taste of strawberries?
FRODO: ( weak whisper ) No, Sam. I can't recall the taste of food; nor the sound of water; nor the touch of grass . . . I'm naked in the dark. ( rising panic ) There's no veil between me and the wheel of fire. I can see it with my waking eyes.
SAM: Then let us be rid of it - once and for all! Come on, Mr Frodo. I can't carry it for you . but I can carry you! Come on!
ARAGORN: ( softly ) For Frodo . . .
ORCS!: CUT TO:
SAM: ( growing excitement ) Look, Mr Frodo! We're almost there! -.-.
GOLLUM: Clever Hobbits to climb so high!
SAM: ( yelling desperately )
PIPPIN: ( disbelieving ) Eagles . . . The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!
SAM: ( yelling )
FRODO: I'm here, Sam.
SAM: ( yelling ) Destroy it - go on! Throw it in the fire! What are you waiting for? Just let it go!
FRODO: The Ring is mine.
SAM: No! :
FLOOR!: SUDDENLY! GOLLUM smashes a ROCK down on SAM'S HEAD, knocking him to the GROUND! GOLLUM LEAPS on to the INVISIBLE FRODO! CLOSE ON: FRODO'S FOOTPRINTS . . . staggering about under
GOLLUM'S WEIGHT!: ANGLE ON: GOLLUM clawing FRANTICALLY, riding on the BACK of the INVISIBLE FRODO . . .
HARD!: ANGLE ON: FRODO MATERIALIZES as he DROPS TO HIS KNEES, clutching his BLEEDING HAND . . . he SCREAMS.
ECSTATIC!: CLOSE ON: GOLLUM dancing GLEEFULLY . . . PERILOUSLY close to the EDGE OF THE CHASM!
GOLLUM: Precious! Precious!
HAND!: The CAVERNS are SHAKING VIOLENTLY. SAM desperately reaches for him . . . FRODO is too far down.
SAM: Give me your hand. Take my hand!
SAM: Yes, Mr. Frodo . it's over now.
FRODO: ( remembering ) I can see the Shire . The Brandywine River, Bag End, Gandalf's fireworks . . . the lights in the Party Tree . . .
SAM: Rosie Cotton dancing . she had ribbons in her hair . . . . . . if ever I was to marry someone . . . it would have been her . . . it would have been
FRODO: ( calm ) I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee . . . here at the end of all things.
FRODO: ( CONTINUED )
GANDALF: Now come the days of the King . May they be blessed.
ARAGORN: This day does not belong to one man but to all. Let us together rebuild this world that we may share in the days of peace.
SAM O.S: Mr Frodo?
FRODO: It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed.
FRODO: ( closing the book ) Not quite . . . There's room for a little
BILBO: ( frail ) Frodo . Any chance of seeing that old ring of mine . the one I gave you?
FRODO: ( quietly ) Sorry, Uncle . . . I'm afraid, I lost it.
BILBO: ( frail ) Oh . . . pity. I should like to have held it one last time. · Oh! Well, here's a sight I have never·seen
BILBO: Oh! Well, here's a sight I have never·seen
GALADRIEL: The power of the Three Rings is ended. The time has come for the Dominion of Men.
ELROND: ( ELVISH: with subtitles ) I Aear can ven na mar. T he Sea calls us ho me.
BILBO: I think I'm quite ready for another
GANDALF: Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now finished. Here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship. I will not say: "do not weep", for not all tears are an evil.
SAM: ( alarmed ) What does he mean?
FRODO: ( gently ) We set out to save the Shire, and it has been saved . but not for me . . .
SAM: ( shaken ) You don't mean that - you can't leave.
FRODO: The last pages are for you, Sam.
SAM: He hugs his daughter . . .
SAM: Hello, little Frodo! Well . I'm back.
