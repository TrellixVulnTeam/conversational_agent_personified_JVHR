PAUL: ( ENGLISH )
FUCKING GOD!!!!: As the train moves on he walks, slowly, DESPONDENT. Lost in a private WORLD OF PAIN. Behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered hat walking, gaining on him. This is JEANNE ( 20's ). As she PASSES Paul, she turns to GLANCE at him. We read a HINT of EMPATHY on her face. He is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter. She walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw. We see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING. Paul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as he also notices the building. He REGARDS it.
JEANNE: A phone token, please.
BARTENDER: No tokens. At the end, on the left.
JEANNE: Thank you. Jeanne goes to the TELEPHONE/WASHROOM. The telephone booth is OCCUPIED. As she waits, she watches in disgust as an OLD LADY cleans her DENTURES with a toothbrush and then puts them back in her Jeanne STUDIES her own face in the MIRROR, puffing her cheeks up in judgement. As she does, Paul exits the phone booth, still LOST IN ANGUISH. After watching him leave, Jeanne USES THE PAY PHONE. She speaks to her MOM.
JEANNE: I've come to see the flat. I saw the sign.
CONCIERGE: The sign?
JEANNE: The Concierge joins Jeanne AT THE WINDOW.
CONCIERGE: It's always the same! Nobody ever tells me anything.
JEANNE: I'd like to see it.
CONCIERGE: You want to rent it?
JEANNE: I don't know yet!
CONCIERGE: They rent, they leave and I'm the last to know. Do you think that's She sits at her desk and PUTS OUT HER CIGARETTE.
JEANNE: Let go of me! She gets free of her and heads to the ELEVATOR, rubbing her She's crazy! The ELEVATOR arrives and she gets on. We watch her ascend and
JEANNE: Who are you? No response.
PAUL: ( BARELY AUDIBLE )
JEANNE: Oh yes, I left it open. I didn't hear you come in.
PAUL: I was already here.
JEANNE: Sorry? Oh it was you who took it. I had to bribe the concierge. These old houses are fascinating. She walks up to the FIREPLACE.
PAUL: The armchair should go in front of the window.
JEANNE: Are you American? You've got an American accent. He gets off the radiator and WANDERS into the next room for
PAUL: I don't know. She continues to LOOK AROUND. Her CURIOSITY of Paul gets the best of her. She peeks around the corner and watches him SIT
JEANNE: What are you doing? She thinks he is VERY ODD as he PLAYS WITH a lamp shade. Nature calls. She heads to the
DINING ROOM: They pick up the phone at the SAME TIME. Paul EAVES DROPS
JEANNE'S VOICE: Hello? Hello
PAUL: ( to the caller ) Hello Hello. There's no-one here. There's no-one. I don't know. He puts the SMALL LAMP SHADE back. He hangs the receiver on the back of the chaise. Jeanne continues to listen on her end, UNAWARE. Paul SNEAKS AROUND THE CORNER.
JEANNE: So you're going to take it? You've I had already decided. But I'm not sure now. Do you like it? She's SPEECHLESS.
PAUL: I had already decided. But I'm not sure now. Do you like it? She's SPEECHLESS.
JEANNE: I don't know. I shall have to think about it.
PAUL: Think fast. He WALKS OFF. Jeanne picks her hat off the floor, lost in CONFUSION. The front door SLAMS. She walks toward the door. But Paul didn't really leave. He walks slowly TOWARD HER.
JEANNE: I thought you'd left. He STUDIES HER for a moment. He takes her hat and DROPS IT on the ground. He PICKS HER UP in his arms and CARRIES to the window. He puts her down on the window sill. They start MAKING OUT ferociously. He RIPS her panty hose, UNDOES HIS ZIPPER and PENETRATES HER. They are lost in ANIMALISTIC SEX as she WRAPS HER legs around Ah. Oh, God. They KISS SAVAGELY and HIT the floor as THEY CLIMAX TOGETHER.
PAUL: Ah. Oh, God. They KISS SAVAGELY and HIT the floor as THEY CLIMAX TOGETHER.
TOM: Watch out!
JEANNE: Have they taken us for someone We're in a film. He walks her and EXPLAINS.
TOM: We're in a film. He walks her and EXPLAINS.
JEANNE: What's going on? Do you know them?
TOM: It's a long story. In short, Portrait of a Girl. It's been accepted for television! And the girl is you. It's you!
JEANNE: You're mad! You might have asked me Yeah, but I wanted. Jeanne SMACKS THE MICROPHONE out of their faces.
TOM: Yeah, but I wanted. Jeanne SMACKS THE MICROPHONE out of their faces.
JEANNE: So you kissed me, and you knew it was being filmed. You're a bastard! No, you'll see. It will be a love story. Tell me, Jeanne, darling. What did you do while I was away?
TOM: No, you'll see. It will be a love story. Tell me, Jeanne, darling. What did you do while I was away?
JEANNE: I thought of you day and night, and I cried. Darling, I can't live without you!
TOM: Wonderful! Cut! That was perfect! He is THRILLED. He tries to kiss her but she won't let him. She is still MIFFED. But she finally GIVES IN. They have a
CATHERINE: I'd have finished by now, but the police wouldn't let me touch anything. They didn't believe it was suicide. She WIPES A MIRROR.
PAUL: Turn the tap off now.
CATHERINE: They'll be doing the autopsy right Paul walks to her side.
PAUL: Why won't you turn the tap off?
CATHERINE: They told me to give you your razor She hands him the STRAIGHT RAZOR. He STUDIES IT.
PAUL: It's not mine.
CATHERINE: They said they don't need it any more. The investigation is over. He grabs her hands VIOLENTLY and studies them.
MOVER: Excuse me, where shall I put this?
JEANNE: You could have rung the bell.
MOVER: The door was open. I'll put it He puts the chair down in the middle of the room. She moves it to in front of the fireplace instead.
JEANNE: In front of the fireplace. She heads to the front door but is stopped by.
MOVER 2: Careful, madame. With and armfull of chairs.
JEANNE: She tries to leave again but then runs into.
MOVER: What about the table? With a table.
JEANNE: How do I know? He'll decide.
MOVER 2: This is a king-size.
JEANNE: It won't fit!
MOVER: Well, your husband has no idea. All this in an hour. It's not long. She leans against a wall and looks around, FLABBERGASTED.
JEANNE: What a mess! We see Paul in the DOORWAY paying the movers.
MOVER: Thank you.
MOVER 2: Thank you. He comes in.
PAUL: The armchair goes in front of the He DRAGS THE CHAIR AND HER to the window instead.
JEANNE: But I only came to return the key. To return it to you.
PAUL: I don't care about the key. Take your coat off. He takes his COAT OFF and hangs it on a DOOR HANDLE.
JEANNE: Get those chairs and bring them He grabs the TABLE and brings it to the DINING ROOM.
PAUL: Get those chairs and bring them He grabs the TABLE and brings it to the DINING ROOM.
JEANNE: You didn't waste any time. But he has WANDERED OFF to another room.
PAUL: The bed is too big for the room.
JEANNE: I don't know what to call you.
PAUL: I don't have a name.
JEANNE: Do you want to know mine?
PAUL: No, no! I don't. I don't want to know your name. He COVERS HER MOUTH and backs her up agianst a WALL.
JEANNE: You're crazy! She leans against the adjacent wall.
PAUL: Maybe I am, but I don't want to know anything about you. I don't wanna know where you live or where you come from. I wanna know nothing, nothing, nothing.
JEANNE: You scare me. Back to the OTHER WALL.
PAUL: You and I are gonna meet here without knowing anything that goes on outside here. He indicates OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
OK?: But why?
JEANNE: But why?
PAUL: Because. Because we don't need names here. Don't you see? We're gonna forget. everything that we knew. Every. All the people,. all that we do,. wherever we live. We're going to forget that, everything, everything.
JEANNE: But I can't. Can you?
PAUL: I don't know. Are you scared?
JEANNE: She walks to the bed, inviting him with her eyes.
ROSA'S MOTHER: I thought you'd be here.
PAUL: I expected you later.
ROSA'S MOTHER: I took the first train. We notice the IRONY of the SIGN ON THE DOOR, it reads "PRIVY"
MOMENTS LATER: Paul grows BORED of the reunion, he TAPS HIS FINGERS on the closet he LEANS AGAINST, studying the accessories of the DECOR and her silly hat. She sits, SPILLING HER GRIEF on Paul as if it is a THERAPY
PAUL: What are you looking for?
ROSA'S MOTHER: Something that would explain. A letter, a clue.
PAUL: Nothing. I told you, there's nothing, nothing at all. He takes the purses and PUTS THEM BACK. She sits on the bed in DESPAIR.
ROSA'S MOTHER: My little Rosa wouldn't have. Nothing for her mother. Not a word.
PAUL: It's useless to keep on searching.
ROSA'S MOTHER: Not even for you, her husband! He closes the ARMOIRE.
PAUL: You need to rest. I think room 12 is free. He GATHERS HER BELONGINGS and leads her UP THE STAIRS.
GUEST: Rosa's Mother stops on the stairway, REFLECTING PAINFULLY.
ROSA'S MOTHER: ROSA'S MOTHER ( CONT'D ) With a razor? Paul goes on, IGNORING HER.
PAUL: I don't know. In the evening.
ROSA'S MOTHER: And then?
PAUL: Then I. I already told you on the phone. When I found her, I called the ambulance. Paul goes out to the HALLWAY to gather himself.
ROSA'S MOTHER: After you called, Papa and I stayed up all night, talking about Rosa and you. Papa kept whispering, as if it had happened in our house. Rosa's mother thinks he LEFT. She YELLS.
PAUL: In one of the rooms.
ROSA'S MOTHER: Did she suffer?
PAUL: Ask the Doctors. They're doing the The autopsy. He goes into the .

PAUL: He DARES HER with his eyes, ENRAGED.
ROSA'S MOTHER: Paul, don't shout. Don't talk like He SNATCHES THE PAPER from her hands.
PAUL: The priest doesn't want any suicides. The Church doesn't want any suicides, do they?
ROSA'S MOTHER: They'll give her absolution. He RAISES HIS HAND threatening to HIT HER.
PAUL: Scared, she pushes on.
ROSA'S MOTHER: Absolution and a nice mass. That's all I ask, Paul. Rosa. Rosa is my little girl, do you understand? Rosa. Why did she kill herself? She starts WEEPING.
PAUL: Why? Why did she commit suicide? He PUMMELS THE DOOR with his fists . ENRAGED.

PAUL: OOh. Now. Let's. Let's just look at each other.
JEANNE: It's beautiful without knowing They REGARD each other for seconds.
PAUL: Come without touching? OK. He leans his head back and CLOSES his eyes. SCREWING UP HIS FACE. She COPIES HIM.
JEANNE: No. It's difficult!
PAUL: I didn't either yet. You're not trying hard enough. They STOP THE SILLINESS. They laugh. She wraps her arms around his neck.
JEANNE: I shall have to invent a name for A name? Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, God, I've been called by a million names all my life. I don't want a name. I'm better off with a grunt or a groan for a name. Do you wanna hear my name?
PAUL: A name? Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, God, I've been called by a million names all my life. I don't want a name. I'm better off with a grunt or a groan for a name. Do you wanna hear my name?
JEANNE: It's so masculine.

PAUL: I didn't get the last name. She redoes the SOUNDS for him. He JOINS her. Their ANIMAL
TOM: You shouldn't have done that to me. She is much more EXCITED about the NEW PERM.
JEANNE: It's not a wig, it's my hair. She CLOSES THE GATE. Doesn't it suit me? Tell me, don't you like it? Tell me.
TOM: Of course I like it. Listen, you know. I don't know. You have changed, and yet you haven't. I can see the shot now. He twirls around, setting up the shot between his hands and his MINDS EYE.

OLYMPIA: Mustapha could always tell the poor from the rich.
JEANNE: Olympia, open the front door.
OLYMPIA: Give me a kiss. Jeanne stands and KISSES HER on the cheek through the gate.
JEANNE: Go and open it.
JEANNE'S VOICE: After Papa died, we moved back to the family home for a while. My childhood was made up of smells. Musty smells, the smell of walls and rooms. A GROUP OF KIDS runs into the yard. Children used to come and play in my jungle, all day long. Growing old is a crime.
JEANNE: That's me there. And that's Mademoiselle Sauvage, the teacher. She was very strict. and very Olympia CHIMES IN AGAIN from behind the CAMERA CREW.
OLYMPIA: She was too good. She spoilt you. The Camera Crew turns the camera on her. Jeanne has a DIFFERENT PICTURE, pointing again.
JEANNE: That's Christine. They turn back to Jeanne.
OLYMPIA: I couldn't live in Paris. The camera turns on her, then back to Jeanne.
JEANNE: We're safe here. It's odd looking at the past.
TOM: He walks to her.
JEANNE: What are you doing?
TOM: Setting up my shot. There it is! That's it! I've found it. Reverse Olympia is loitering in one of the rooms he comes in. Imagine her nerve, in her own house! Tom is the typical RUDE FRENCH DIVA DIRECTOR.

AS WE: CUT TO:
JEANNE'S VOICE: Sitting at the piano. His fingers would skim the keys. The FILM CREW follow them, filming.
JEANNE: Aren't my trees beautiful? They were my jungle. They come upon the CROWD OF KIDS again. One KID is squatting behind some thatch, doing his business.
KID 1: Having a shit. The boy pooping stops and PULLS UP HIS PANTS.
KID 2: No, we're doing a poo. Jeanne SCOLDS THEM.
JEANNE: Shame on you, doing it in my Watch out!
KID 1: Watch out!
KID 2: Run for it! They SCATTER towards the STONE WALL with Olympia and Crew
OLYMPIA: Oh, these dirty little Arabs! Go and shit in your own country! The kids CLIMB THE WALL for escape from the CRAZY ADULTS.
TOM: Keep filming. Keep filming! Don't stop, whatever you do! Tom wanders back over to Jeanne while Olympia and the Crew continue to SCARE OFF THE KIDS in the b.g..
JEANNE: Did you get it?
TOM: Olympia was great. It'll give a good idea of race relations in the suburbs of Paris.
JEANNE: Olympia was great. It'll give a good idea of race relations in the suburbs of Paris.
TOM: It's a real jungle here. So, tell me about your father.
JEANNE: I thought we'd finished.
TOM: Five minutes.
JEANNE: I'm meeting someone for work.
TOM: But the colonel. the colonel! But Jeanne is OFF.
JEANNE: The colonel had green eyes and shiny boots. I worshipped him. He was so handsome in his uniform.
PAUL'S VOICE: What a steaming pile of horseshit.
JEANNE: Pissed, she THROWS THE PILLOW she was covering her AMPLE BREAST with at Paul. We now see Paul is LOUNGING ON HIS MATTRESS, pant legs rolled up past his knees, TOYING WITH A HARMONICA and drinking from a WOODEN CUP.
PAUL: All uniforms are bullshit. Everything outside this place is bullshit. Besides, I don't want to hear about your stories, about your past, and all that.
JEANNE: He died in Algeria in 58.
PAUL: Or 68 or 28 or 98.
JEANNE: 58, and don't joke about things like that.
PAUL: Listen, why don't you stop talking about things that don't matter here? What the hell's the DIALOGUE SWITCHES TO ENGLISH She huffs over to the other SIDE OF THE ROOM, crossing her arms, POUTING.
JEANNE: She huffs over to the other SIDE OF THE ROOM, crossing her arms, POUTING.
PAUL: Come on the good ship.
JEANNE'S VOICE: Why don't you go back in America? He stops PLAYING THE TUNE.
PAUL: I don't know. Bad memories, I Of what?
JEANNE: Of what?
PAUL: Oh. My father was a. a drunk. Tough. Whore-fucker, bar-fighter. Super-masculine. And he was tough. My mother was very. Very poetic. And also a drunk. And. one of my memories, when I was a kid, was of her being arrested nude. We lived in this small town. Farming community. We lived on a farm. And I'd come home after school and she'd be gone. In jail. or something. And. I used to. I used to have to milk a cow every morning and every night and I liked that. I remember. An IRISH COUNTRY JIG plays over the MONOLOGUE.
JEANNE'S VOICE: Not one?
PAUL: Yeah. Some. There was a farmer, a very nice guy. Old guy, very poor, and worked real hard. I used to work in a ditch, draining land for farming. And he wore overalls and he smoked a clay pipe. Half the time he wouldn't put tobacco in it. And I hated the work. It was hot and dirty and. it broke my back. And. all day long I'd watch his spit which would run down the pipe stem and hang on the bowl of the pipe. And I used to make bets with myself on when it was going to fall off. And I always lost. I never saw it fall off. I'd just look around and it'd be gone and then the new one would be there. And then we had a beautiful. My mother. My mother taught me to love nature. And. I guess that was the most she could do. And. we had. In front of our house we had this big field. meadow. It was a mustard field in the summer and we had a big black dog named Dutchy. And she used to hunt for rabbits in that field but she couldn't see them. So she'd have to leap up in this mustard field and look around very quickly to see where the rabbits were. And it was. very beautiful. And she never caught the rabbits. Jeanne looks up from the bed, MISCHIEVOUSLY.
JEANNE: You have been had!
PAUL: Oh really?
JEANNE: I don't wanna know anything about your past, baby!
PAUL: You think I was telling you the Jeanne flaps her arms. Paul TWILLS his eyebrows in response.

PAUL: The better to squeeze a fart out of She plays with his hands.
JEANNE: What long nails you have!
PAUL: The better to scratch your ass She REACHES UNDER the sleeve of his shirt to his chest.
JEANNE: Oh, what a lot of fur you have!

JEANNE: Ooh, what a long tongue you have! He TALKS FUNNY as Jeanne holds on to his tounge.
PAUL: The better to. to stick in your rear, my dear.
JEANNE: What's this for?
PAUL: That's your happiness and my. my Jeanne SMILES ON as Paul reels off a list of FOREIGN NAMES for the MALE GENITALIA.
JEANNE: Jeanne SMILES ON as Paul reels off a list of FOREIGN NAMES for the MALE GENITALIA.
PAUL: Schlong. Wienerwurst. Cazzo. Bitte. Prick! Joint! Jeanne gets a kick out of this. Sort of.
JEANNE: It's funny. It's like playing grown- ups when you're little. I feel like a child again here.
PAUL: Did you have fun as a kid?
JEANNE: It's the most beautiful thing.
PAUL: It's beautiful to be made into a tattletale or forced to admire authority or sell yourself for a piece of candy.
JEANNE: I wasn't like that.
PAUL: I was writing poems. I was drawing castles,. big castles with tower. A lot of tower.

PAUL: You mean when he first got into your knickers.
JEANNE: He was a child prodigy. He was playing with both hands.
PAUL: I'll bet he was. Probably getting his kicks.
JEANNE: We were dying of heat.
PAUL: Oh, yeah. Good excuse. What else?
JEANNE: In the afternoon, when the grown- ups were napping.
PAUL: You started grabbing his joint.
JEANNE: You're crazy!
PAUL: Well, he touched you.
JEANNE: I never let him! Never!
PAUL: Ohhhh. Liar, liar, pants on fire, nose as long as a telephone wire.
JEANNE: No, I'm not.
PAUL: Look me straight in the face and say, "He didn't touch me once." She SMILES.
JEANNE: He touched me, but the way he did Aha! The way he did it. OK, what did he do?
PAUL: Aha! The way he did it. OK, what did he do?
JEANNE: Behind the house, there were two trees. A plane tree and a chestnut. I sat under the plane tree and he sat under the chestnut. And one, two, three. We each began to masturbate. The first who came. Paul is suddenly LOST IN HIS THOUGHTS. He wanders to the wall, leans on it and studies his harmonica.
PAUL: When did you first come? How old were you?
JEANNE: The first time? I was really late for school. I started running and it was downhill. All of a sudden, I felt a strong sensation here. So I ran and ran and I came as I ran. The faster I ran, the better it was and the more I came. A couple of days later, I tried to do it again, but no luck. Paul climbs a TRIPOD that is leaning against the wall.
DINING ROOM: Paul is REUNITED with his SMALL LAMP SHADE. He puts it over his face and CRIES into it.
LIVING ROOM: Jeanne has CUM. She ROLLS OFF THE MATTRESSES onto the floor,
DINING ROOM: Paul is LOST IN GRIEF, crying harder.
ROSA'S MOTHER: I can't sleep with this music.
PAUL: I came to this hotel a long time ago, to spend one night. And I stayed for five years.
ROSA'S MOTHER: When Papa and I had the hotel, people came here to sleep.
PAUL: Now, there's all sorts. They can hide, take drugs, play music.
ROSA'S MOTHER: You're not alone, Paul. I'm here. He sits up calmly, taking her hand in his own, then. BITES
HER!!!: She PULLS HER HAND BACK in obvious pain.
PAUL: Do you want me to make them shut up? OK. I'll make them shut up. Paul gets up and TURNS OFF THE MASTER LIGHT SWITCH. Rosa's mother STANDS, SCARED.

PAUL: What's the matter, Mother? Are you upset? Don't be. There's nothing to be upset about. It takes so little to make them afraid. I'll tell you what they're afraid of. He leads her by the ARM to the stairs.
ROSA'S MOTHER: Put the light on! They look up the stairs to all the GUESTS that are out of their rooms.

HOTEL ENTRANCE: Rosa's Mother stares on as the COMMOTION CLEARS. A GUEST comes in the front door carrying NEWSPAPERS. This is MARCEL, ( 60's ) Rosa's LOVER. He takes off his hat for her.
MARCEL: Good evening, madame.
ROSA'S MOTHER: Good evening. Paul saunters into the room. He surveys the IRONIC SCENE.
PAUL: Good evening, Marcel. Marcel picks up on the awkward energy. He heads up the stairs to his room. Paul hands him a key on the way up.

He joins her at the LARGE BASIN SINK. She pretends to have been putting on her make-up all along. She RESUMES HER SONG.
JEANNE: What am I doing in this apartment with you? Love? Paul starts putting his SHAVING CREAM on with a shaving Well. Let's say we're just taking a flying. a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut.

PAUL: Well,. either they always pretend to know who I am or they pretend I don't know who they are and that's very boring.
JEANNE: I'm not afraid to say who I am. I am 20 years old. Paul EXPLODES.
PAUL: NO! I. Jesus Christ! Where is your brain? State zitta. Halt's Maul, Schweinehund. Shut up. Get She stands, POUTING.
JEANNE: Again! Do it again! Again!
JEANNE'S VOICE: I'm coming! I'm ready. She comes around the corner.
JEANNE: Shall we leave together? . Just in time for Paul to SLAM THE DOOR IN HER FACE.
JEANNE: Jeanne! What are you doing there? I'm coming! I'll fly! He starts RUNNING TO THE EXIT.
TOM: Jeanne! What are you doing there? I'm coming! I'll fly! He starts RUNNING TO THE EXIT.
JEANNE: Wait! I've got to talk to you.
TOM: Why didn't you speak on the phone? What's up?
JEANNE: You must find someone else.
TOM: For what?
JEANNE: For your film.

MARCEL: Come in! Paul comes in. He is in a MATCHING RED PLAID BATHROBE.
PAUL: You wanted to talk to me. Go on, then. You know I haven't come to cry with you?
MARCEL: Do you mind if I carry on working? He does while Paul ROOTS AROUND.
PAUL: Our bathrobes? You can't tell me anything I don't already know.
MARCEL: Same colour, same pattern.
PAUL: Yes, yes, yes. Paul takes a look at one of the newspapers from Marcel's Your meticulous. I've always wondered why you save newspaper clippings. Is it work? Or a hobby?
MARCEL: Hobby? I don't like that word. Let's say it's some extra cash. I do it for an agency.
PAUL: Oh, so it's serious. It's a job that makes you read? Very Be honest. You didn't know we had the same bathrobes. Paul finds this VERY AMUSING.
MARCEL: Be honest. You didn't know we had the same bathrobes. Paul finds this VERY AMUSING.
PAUL: He sits on MARCELS BED.
MARCEL: We've got a lot of things in Marcello, I know everything. He flicks the light on and off as he talks. No, Rosa often talked to me about you. I don't think there are many marriages like that. It's strange. I'm thirsty. He heads to the door.
PAUL: Marcello, I know everything. He flicks the light on and off as he talks. No, Rosa often talked to me about you. I don't think there are many marriages like that. It's strange. I'm thirsty. He heads to the door.
MARCEL: Hold on. Here's the bourbon. He takes a BOTTLE OF BOURBON from a hiding place. Paul joins him. He pours a glass for Paul.
PAUL: Was that a present from Rosa, too? He POURS A GLASS for himself.
MARCEL: I don't really like bourbon, but Rosa wanted me to keep a bottle here in my room. He SITS back down.
PAUL: It's almost a year that Rosa and I. Not passionately, but regularly. I thought I knew her as much as you can know.
MARCEL: It's almost a year that Rosa and I. Not passionately, but regularly. I thought I knew her as much as you can know.
PAUL: Your mistress.
MARCEL: For example, a while ago, something happened that I still don't understand. Do you see there, on the wall? He points to a spot on the wall above them.
PAUL: Our room is painted white. Rosa wanted it to be different from the other rooms in the hotel. Marcel takes some LIPS SALVE from his bathrobe pocket.
MARCEL: A cold sore. I don't know. Shit. Paul regards him for a second.
PAUL: You're lucky huh? You were. You must have been very handsome 20 years ago.
MARCEL: Not as much as you.
PAUL: You've still got all your hair.
MARCEL: My hair. I have to have it trimmed often. And wash it. I wash it nearly every day.
PAUL: Don't you have massages? He massages his own temples.
MARCEL: Yes, I do.
PAUL: You're in good shape. He paws at Marcel's stomach.
MARCEL: For that. He gazes across the room.
PAUL: Tell me! He takes a bar from the floor and slides it into a spot on the top of a DOOR FRAME.
MARCEL: Are you leaving us? I saw your suitcase was packed. Ah. America. Why was she unfaithful to you?
PAUL: You can't believe that Rosa. killed herself. It's hard for me to. believe, too. While Paul has a moment of REFLECTION, Marcel shows him his PULL-UP LEG KICK combo on his PULL-UP bar.
MARCEL: This is my secret! Thirty times every morning. Paul leaves, DISGUSTED.
PAUL: ( ENGLISH )
JEANNE: Are you in? She looks around the place.

JEANNE'S MOTHER: Of course, I'm not sending the boots. I'm keeping them with me. I get strange shivers when I touch Jeanne goes into an ADJOINING ROOM while her mom continues reflecting, IRONING the JACKET.
JEANNE: When I was little, it seemed really heavy when Papa taught me how to I'm keeping that here. In a respectable household, it's useful to have a weapon.
JEANNE'S MOTHER: I'm keeping that here. In a respectable household, it's useful to have a weapon.

JEANNE'S MOTHER: The important thing is to have one. It makes an impression.

JEANNE'S MOTHER: A fine example of a Berber.
JEANNE: JEANNE'S MOTHER
JEANNE'S MOTHER: A strong race. I tried to employ them as servants, but it was disastrous. 'm glad I decided to send everything to the country. All his things were piling up and piling up.
JEANNE: Don't worry. You'll soon have all the space you want.

TOM: Jeanne gives her upbeat EXTISTENTIAL RESPONSES as her fitting
JEANNE: I see it everywhere. All the time.
TOM: What do you mean, everywhere?
JEANNE: On walls. On buildings.
TOM: Walls and buildings?
JEANNE: Yes, on advertising hoardings.
TOM: What are they selling? Cars. Tinned meat. Cigarettes.
JEANNE: No. They're all about young couples. Before marriage, no children. Then the same couple, married with children. In short, marriage. The perfect, ideal, successful marriage. It's no longer the preserve of the Church. The husband was burdened with responsibilities and the wife nagged. Now, weddings in advertising smile!
TOM: They smile. On posters.
JEANNE: On posters, of course. But why t take poster marriage seriously? Marriage. Pop marriage! Tom comes out from under a DRESS.
TOM: Pop? That's the formula. For pop youth, pop marriage! But. what if the pop marriage doesn't work?
JEANNE: Then you have to fix it like you would a car. The spouses are two workers in overalls bending over an engine to fix it.
TOM: And in case of adultery what happens to the pop marriage?
JEANNE: In that case, there are three or four workers.
TOM: What about love? Is love pop?
JEANNE: No. That's not. Love isn't pop.
TOM: Love isn't pop. So what is it?
JEANNE: The workers retire to a secret flat, take off their overalls and become men and women again and make love. The fussing on the dress is finished. Jeanne slowly, PUTS ON HER GLOVES, relishing them. She STRUTS slowly for all to stare and LAVISH her in her Tom is CAPTIVATED.
TOM: You're wonderful.
JEANNE: It's the dress that makes the You're better than Rita Hayworth. He wanders out into the street. It is RAINING HEAVILY. Better than Joan Crawford! Better than Kim Novak! Better than Lauren Bacall! Better than Ava Gardner when she was Mickey Rooney's lover! Hes FILM CREW scatters for cover.

TOM: When? ln the rain? He runs down the street in the rain looking for her.
JEANNE: Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!
JEANNE'S VOICE: Please forgive me! Paul stops the elevator. He SENDS IT BACK DOWN. We see Jeanne has been waiting on the ADJACENT STAIRS for Paul. She is still in her WEDDING DRESS. She implores Paul from outside the elevator.

JEANNE: I wanna go! I can't make love in this bed any more. I can't. It's disgusting! Nauseating!
PAUL: Well, we'll fuck on the radiator or standing on the mantel.
PAUL'S VOICE: Rat's asshole with mayonnaise! He LAUGHS at himself. Jeanne is a BASKET CASE. She sits on her HAUNCHES, muttering.
JEANNE: I want to get out of here. I want to go. I can't stand it here any more. Yes. I'm going. She gets up, gets her purse and goes to the door. We see her ASS through the SHEER FABRIC of her wedding dress.
FRONT DOOR: Paul is there, WAITING, NONCHALANT.
PAUL: Quo vadis, baby?
JEANNE: I forgot to tell you something. I fell in love with somebody.
PAUL: Oh, isn't that wonderful? You know, you're going to have to get out of these wet duds. He PATS HER ASS.
JEANNE: I'm going to make love with him!
PAUL: Well, first you have to take a hot bath. Cos if you don't. He walks toward her.
PAUL: Give me the soap. She does.
JEANNE: I'm in love.
PAUL: You're in love? He shoves her head UNDER THE WATER.
JEANNE: I'm in love! I'm in love, you He SMACKS her with the washcloth on the head.
PAUL: Fat, is it? How unkind.
JEANNE: Half of your hair is out and the other half is almost white. He smacks her in the mouth with the wash cloth, she smiles.
PAUL: In ten years, you'll be playing soccer with your tits. He starts WASHING HER back.
JEANNE: You will be on a. wheelchair!
PAUL: Well, maybe. But, you know. I'll be smirking and giggling all the way to eternity.

JEANNE: He is like everybody but. at the same time he's different.
PAUL: You mean, like everybody.
JEANNE: Yeah, but. even he fright me. Even he frightens me.
PAUL: What is he, your local pimp?
JEANNE: He could be. He looks it. You know why I'm in love with him?
PAUL: I can't wait.
JEANNE: Because he know. He know how to make me fall in love with him. She gets out. He COVERS her with a BIG RED TOWEL.
PAUL: You want this man you love to protect and take care of you.
JEANNE: You want this golden, shining, powerful warrior to build a fortress where you can hide in. So you don't have to ever. have. You don't ever have to be afraid. You don't have to feel lonely or empty. That's what you want, isn't Well, you'll never find it.

JEANNE: Well, you'll never find it.
PAUL: Well, you'll never find it.
JEANNE: But I find this man.
PAUL: Then it won't be long until he'll want you to build a fortress for him out of your tits and out of your cunt and your hair and your smile and the way you smell. And. and some place where he can feel comfortable and secure enough so that he can worship in front of the altar of his own prick.
JEANNE: But I find this man! They lean against SEPERATE WALLS.
PAUL: No, you're alone. You're all alone. You won't be free of that feeling of being alone until you look death right in the face. I mean, that sounds like bullshit, some romantic crap, until you go right up into the ass of death. Right up in his ass. till you find the womb of fear. And then,. maybe. Maybe then, you'll be able to find him.
JEANNE: But I find this man. He's you! You are that man! Paul doesn't like that comment. He needs to TEACH HER another LESSON. He bites a HANGNAIL.
PAUL: Get me the scissors.
JEANNE: Get me the fingernail scissors. She STOMPS past him to get them, hands them to him.
PAUL: Get me the fingernail scissors. She STOMPS past him to get them, hands them to him.
JEANNE: That's it. He stands FACING the wall and PULLS HIS pants down.
PAUL: I want you to put your fingers up my ass.
JEANNE: Put your fingers up my ass, are you deaf? Go on. I'm gonna get a pig. and I'm. I'm gonna have the pig fuck you.
PAUL: Put your fingers up my ass, are you deaf? Go on. I'm gonna get a pig. and I'm. I'm gonna have the pig fuck you.
JEANNE: I want the pig to die while. while you're fucking him. Then you'll have to go behind him. I want you to smell the dying farts of the pig. Are you gonna do all of that for me?

PAUL: It's four in the morning.
PROSTITUTE: I need room four for a while.
PAUL: We're full. She knocks on the door, INCESANTLY.
PROSTITUTE: That's not true. When you're full, you put a sign outside. I know the hotel. I'm sick of arguing out on the street. Call the owner. What are you waiting for? The owner has never made a fuss. Rosa and I are old friends. Open up. Paul opens up.
PAUL: I'm very sorry.
PROSTITUTE: Hurry up! He can't be far away.

JEANNE: Come in, it's open. Tom comes in. Jeanne stares out the window. She is BATHED in Tom LOOKS AROUND in b.g.
TOM: But I'd like a girl, too. Rosa. As in Rosa Luxemburg. Less famous, but I like it. You know, I wanted to film you every day. In the morning, when you wake up, in the evening, when you sleep. When you first smile, and I didn't film any of that. Here. He hands her FLOWERS. She REGARDS them. He circles to her front.
JEANNE: I'm here! They continue shouting across the apt.
TOM: It's too big! We'll get lost!
JEANNE: Stop it! Don't start!
TOM: How did you find this flat?
JEANNE: By chance.
TOM: We'll change everything! Jeanne holds her ARMS OUT like a bird.

TOM: Go on, Jeanne. Take off! MUSIC RISES as Jeanne pretends to FLY AROUND the apt. from ROOM TO ROOM making AIRPLANE NOISES as Tom DIRECTS HER.
JEANNE: What's happening?
TOM: The patches of turbulence are over. We can't play like children any more, Jeanne. This stops Jeanne in her TRACKS. They face each other.
JEANNE: Adults? That's awful!
TOM: Yes. It's awful.
JEANNE: What do adults do?
TOM: I don't know. We'll have to invent the gestures and the words. For example, adults. He walks slowly toward her. They EMBRACE PASSIONATELY. They He breaks away again, SERIOUS.
JEANNE: And. they face up to problems.
TOM: And. they face up to problems.
JEANNE: .Yes, yes. Yes, yes. He STOPS ABRUPTLY.
TOM: You see, Jeanne, this flat won't work for us. This flat, it won't work for us, Jeanne.
JEANNE: Where are you going?
TOM: To look for a flat. He walks out to a SHOCKED Jeanne.
JEANNE: What kind of flat? But he COMES BACK.
TOM: A flat we can live in.
JEANNE: We can live here.
TOM: It's squalid. It smells. It makes me sick. Are you coming with me?
JEANNE: No, no. I've got to close the windows and return the key. There's a lot to do.
TOM: They meet in the middle of the room again. They share a

TOM: Tom leaves Jeanne to it. She opens the LARGE WINDOW. We can hear the TRAIN below. She says goodbye to the apt. emotionally, CLOSING THE SHUTTER, then finally, the window.
PAUL: It's me again. She stops and stares at him, DISGUSTED by his GALL and over It's over. It's over. He doesn't get the hint. He doesn't care what she says. He presses on PLAYFULLY.
JEANNE: It's over. It's over. He doesn't get the hint. He doesn't care what she says. He presses on PLAYFULLY.
PAUL: It's over, then it begins again.
JEANNE: What begins again? I don't understand anything any more.
PAUL: There's nothing to understand. We left the apartment. Now we begin again with love and all the rest of The rest?
JEANNE: The rest?
PAUL: Yeah, listen. He puts his arm around her as THEY STROLL.
PAUL'S VOICE: But you know, what the hell. I'm. no prize. I picked up a nail when I was in Cuba in and now I got a prostate like an Idaho potato. But I'm still a good stick man, even if I can't have any children. Let's see. I don't have any stomping grounds. I don't have any friends. I suppose if I hadn't met you, I'd probably settle for a hard chair and a hemorrhoid. Anyway, to make a long, dull story even duller, I come from a time when a guy like me would drop into a joint like this and pick up a young chick like you and. and call her a bimbo. He reaches the other side of the dance floor where Jeanne waits for him. She is able to SMILE now at his SHENANIGANS. He has a real JOIE DE VIVRE about him now that he LACKED
PAUL: I'm awfully sorry to intrude but I was so struck with your beauty that I thought I could offer you a glass of champagne. Is this seat taken?
JEANNE: May I?
PAUL: May I?
JEANNE: If you'd like to. He sits down with her. He CLAPS his hands.
PAUL: A WAITER comes over.
DANCE FLOOR: We watch one of the DANCE COUPLES DANCE THE TANGO. We focus on their LEGS and FEET. We make it back to Paul and Jeanne and Champagne.
DANCE FLOOR: We watch a DIFFERENT COUPLE DANCE. Paul tries to BUTTER UP ( pardon the pun ) Jeanne.
JEANNE: OK, I love you.
PAUL: Tell me about your wife.
JEANNE: Tell me about your wife.
PAUL: Let's talk about us.
JEANNE: OK. But this place is so pitiful.
PAUL: Yes, but I'm here, aren't I? He kisses her on the cheek.
JEANNE: Monsieur Maitre d'Hôtel.
