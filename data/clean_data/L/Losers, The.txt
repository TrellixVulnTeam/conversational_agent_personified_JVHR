JENSEN: This even me up?
ROQUE: This is an Agency gig?
ROQUE: For that we had to put on a blindfold and turn around three times?
MISSION CONTROLLER-: Clay GRABS THE RADIO from Jensen:
MILITARY NETWORK--: Very stupid, Colonel... Franklin... Clay.
CLAY: Shit! Jensen, call the General at the Firebase, get him to abort-
(LOOKING UP): There's nothing we can do...
PERVERT: Omar DOESN'T MOVE. Instead, he eerily raises his hand and wordlessly POINTS TO A CELL. In the corner. And Clay hears a MOAN emit from it. VAGUELY HUMAN.
SOMETHING HORRIFIC: ...was IA Field Ops hunting rogue agents... Max caught me...
CLAY: Fadhil.
COUGAR (CONT'D): Run.
OMAR: Clay nods. A beat. The Pilot pulls the stick back and the CHOPPER ASCENDS. The kids wave goodbye to our guys.
FENNEL: What are you talking about "MAX?"
(PAUSE): Wait - are you saying you're Max?
MORE SECONDS-: I told you, I'm not good with bombs! How are those bars coming?
ROQUE: You know where you're messing up? You're putting all our money on the dogs with the best odds.
ROQUE (CONT'D): We're at a dogtrack at 10 a.m. - could this get any more sleazy?
CLAY: We're on the run. It occasionally
INVOLVES RUNNING-: I'm serious. Grinding out lunch money on five dollar sports bets, wincing everytime some overly Aqua- netted cow stares at my face for more than two seconds-
(DELICATELY): I'm at the point where I'm thinking we ought to try to reach out to the Company...
PLAYGROUND): Pooch can run the motor pool out of the ball pit and Jensen can set up communications by the slide!
(PAUSE): Maybe it's time for a new game.
AISHA: I don't eat red meat.
(PAUSE): Think we can change that?
AISHA: You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a "no" here?
CLAY: Noticed. What do you want?
CLAY: So what's to stop me from putting a bullet in your head?
CLAY: Okay.
MAX: Okay, here's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing "No." I'm hearing "Leave," and I'm hearing "I'm sorry." Is that what I'm hearing?
MAX: (as if to a child) I think I speak for everyone here when I say that your actions were excessive and, yes, more than just a little wasteful...
(PAUSE): I need one to test and one to use.
MAX: Of course one to test - you think I trust you?
MAX: Call our people at Goliath, tell them we'll have a special package arriving on the 17th.
ROQUE: Carla.
SHOT YOU-: Okay. Yes. She shot me.
(PAUSE): But only in the leg.
POOCH: Damn. We missed you too.
POOCH: Jesus, Lady! Ten outta ten for stealth and shit, but next time could you just knock?
(TO CLAY): She put a bomb in your car?
(TO AISHA): I'm gonna need a moment alone with the boys if you don't mind, but I'd like to reserve the right to awkwardly hit on you later?
(TO CLAY): Have fun...
(OPENING LAPTOP): Her intel checks out. The cargo will be arriving here in two days.
(MORE): As does Hamas, Sien Fein, MOSAAD-- pretty much everyone with the exception of PETA wants this chick amscrayed.
COUNTRY-: Country turned her back on us, and God can screw. This one's for us.
MAX: 90 percent of the globe is tooling up to whack us and we're too busy losing our nerve to notice. It's Us versus Them and right now my money would be on them...
WADE: I don't. Just want to make sure everyone gets paid.
(MORE): It was his way of measuring the good he did in the world. Without it, he's just another loser like the rest of us.
JENSEN: So, you grew up in the Hindu Kush, huh? That must've been rough.
AISHA: I'm giving you a chance to get even. That's all you need to know.
(TO AISHA): Sound fair?
KINDSA SHIT-: What do you think we are now? (to all of them) Best case scenario, this gets us face to face with Max-
ROQUE: What if it doesn't? What if we never get face to face with him. Are you gonna be able to live with that? Ever?
(PAUSE): We do this, we're declaring war on the Central Intelligence Agency.
CLAY: Are we wired?
(INTO RADIO): Target is westbound. Heading for the bridge...
COUGAR: TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE GROUND. Lashed into a BRIDGE SUPPORT. He racks the bolt of his NTW-20 ANTI MATERIAL RIFLE - a monster of a weapon with a bulky starlight scope.
DOORS --: Cavalry's here!
SOLDIER 1: Sir, that smell! It's- gasoline!
(OPENING LAPTOP): Nukes. That's a nuke. Who makes nukes? Department of Defense. DOD Mainframe. I gotta hack the
DOD MAINFRAME-: It would really be good if you didn't talk right now- get that casing off for me.
JENSEN: Hold position!
JENSEN: Computer crashed!
HUMOR-: I told you, I'm not good at bombs!
ROQUE: What?
FENNEL: Max thinks the country's lost it's way, gone soft in the War on Terror! This is his solution!
POOCH: What was the target?
SCREAMS: The Mall of America! Christ!
FENNEL: Max's heroin operation - Goliath keeps accounts of the shipments!
(MORE): Max gives us back our lives or we upload the data to the net, show the American people what's being done in their names.
(PAUSE): Did I just actually say that?
MAX: Because I've been such a fan of how things have gone up till now?
BUSY GUY-: The Jamal al-Fadhil situation?
(MORE): I look at that entire incident as your standard "getting to know" each other business orientation.
(THINKING): You get that six man team together like I asked?
CLAY (CONT'D): Why do you want Max dead?
AISHA: If you two really fought, he would kill you, I think.
AISHA: Oh, yes we are...
CLAY: Pooch, we're on a schedule here-
(TO JENSEN): I'll take that, thank you.
JENSEN: Ladies... hi.
(MORE): individual exposing himself to women in the elevators--best discussed in person. If you'd just head on down...
JENSEN: Hi, I'm Skippy from tech support. Is Henderson around? I'm supposed to install a firewall on his system-
JENSEN (CONT'D): Five minutes and I'll be out of your hair!
JENSEN: Bang.
(CONSIDERING): Okay. Put a fire team together.
CLAY: Goliath must have brought them in after we hit their truck...
JENSEN: You won't believe how detailed these files are. Every Goliath executive they've ever insured, their policies, their payouts-
(TO POOCH): What are you doing up?
(LAUGHING): So my wife and my four year old ended up tying a frilly purple ribbon round the old oak tree in our yard to bring Daddy home...
CLAY: Max's true target. Yeah.
JENSEN: I know it makes no sense, but actually yes.
JENSEN: My dick remains unshot!
(MORE): (off Wade's look) We know exactly where they're going, Wade. Port of New York, for their big final awesome stand against the forces of evil where they die.
SHORT SCIENTIST: Twenty three hours, fifty nine minutes...
CLAY: I know...
(SMALLER VOICE): Precious, precious blood...
CLAY: Excuse me?
(TO CLAY): To steal them back. And I'm prepared to do anything to any one to make that happen.
ROQUE (CONT'D): Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win.
POOCH: Twelve hours from now? You mean-- you want us to go in blind?
CLAY: What can I say, I hold a grudge.
(TO JENSEN): Get gone.
ROQUE: No. Not Aisha.
(NODDING): Roque.
CLAY: When...?
(MORE): You just wanted your revenge. Your face-to-face with the big bad wolf. I'm sorry, buddy, but it's the way of the world...
CLAY: Kill me now... Maybe you live through this.
WADE (CONT'D): It's for our replacement nuke. When a billion goes missing, people tend to ask who took it.
(CHUCKLING): Max really does love to frame you...
(TO ROQUE): I'll see you at Turner Airfield.
(NOTICING): What are you smiling at?
I KNOW-: There was no drive and Roque's gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and Pooch could bleed out-
POOCH: Next time, remind me - car crash first, then get shot...
(RE: AISHA): Where the hell is she going? Aisha is heading off to the fenceline... Clay and Cougar run for Wade's CORVETTE. Cougar slides behind the wheel and starts her up, PEELING OUT after the plane...
ROQUE: Gotta admit, I always wondered how this would play out.
CLAY: Not by a longshot. You're not having a real great day, Max.
MAX: I understand you've always wanted to meet face to face. I'm sure that could be arranged...
POOCH: Ready when you are.
SHORT SCIENTEST: Because you are so much taller than I.
